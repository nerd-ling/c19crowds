rTlHE Supreme Moment had arrived, and a wild shout of triumphant rejoicing went up from the Astronomers.
-*- They were of all sorts and conditions, these last. A motley crew; for among them were Statesmen, Poets, Finan-
ciers, Philosophers, and the larger and lesser lights of Science, Literature, and Art.
But with one accord they all swept their well-smoked seventy-five-inch reflectors on to the central wonder of the hour,
and watched the progress of the Great Transit in an attitude of inquiring but respectful awe.
It was a tremendous and memorable phenomenon. The internal contact of Ingress was over, and the dark body of
the living planet, that seemed to have a majestic wink in its eye, was now moving swiftly but splendidly across the illuminated
disc of the great world beyond.
"Ach! mein Oott! but it is nicely I have focussed him!" shouted a burly German Chancellor, quite carried away
by the impressive brilliance of the spectacle. "So! I have him. See, he already corrects for us the political parallax."
"Extremely glad, my dear Chancellor, that he has induced you to admit the possibility of correcting anything." It
was a Grand Old Man that spoke, and as he followed the remarkable object, now clearly defined in the very meridian of its
passage, he saluted it instinctively, through his eye-piece, with a friendly but courteous nod. "Ah," he continued, following
the progress with reflective interest, "we are very old friends, he and I; and I think I may venture to add that for a period
of something like two-and-forty years I have seldom if ever had my eye off him. Hinc illi triumphi!"
"Mais, sapristi, mon bon Williams, but you anticipate !" rejoined a portly Frenchman, whose arm was still in a frling.
"Triumphus, indeed! Le vrai triomphe is not for one alone. Ilfaut qtie nous y soxjons. Without us your year closes in a
fanfaronade. Old. But it is only yet December. Do not promise yourself too much!"
"It is far better to promise yourself something in December than in May," remarked a melancholy Astronomer in an
ample cloak and a sad voice.
There was an unsympathetic laugh from the scientific crowd, and the Speaker might have replied. But at that moment
the marvellous load-star of their speculations neared the further limit of the gleaming orb.
Once more, amid a breathless silence, a thousand seventy-five-inch reflectors were following the course of the mysti-
fying Planet.

PUNCH. OR THE LOND.ON CHAEIVART. [December 30, 18S2.
And now the lineaments and features of a striking and familiar face began to be visible, as the vivid body prepared to
enter upon the internal contact of Egress. A thrill of strange delight swept over the multitude.
"It is not Venus—it is more beautiful!" shouted several thousand enthusiastic voices in chorus.
"Quite so; and it seems to be taking on a remarkably pleasing appearance; undergoing a species of natural develop-
ment!" cried a Noble E»rl, sympathetically. "' Sam changer' is a fine motto, but give me the surprise of practical
progress."
"Kismet! let me have a look, then !" whined a slippered Buffoon in a fez, at the same moment trying in vain to fix
the moving wonder of the heavens with half an inverted and cracked opera-glass. "But I can see nothing," he added, in
disgust. "I never can."
"None so blind as those who won't see," threw in an Egyptian Philosopher, quietly working out his passage to Ceylon
in a cushioned arm-chair, and surveying the transit tranquilly through the smoke of his cigarette. "But, dear me," he con-
tinued, with placid interest, "in the name of the Pharaohs, what is the humorous celestial body about?"
As he spoke the now living ball of the Planet, in apparent obedience to some wondrous law of its existence, seemed
tlowly to uncoil itself, and be feeling for something in its coat-pocket In another moment it had flung a glittering paree'
into the air.
There was a cry of frantic excitement from the bewildered Astronomers.
"Who is he? What is be about? What has he cast to us?" they shouted.
"Don't you know?" replied a stout, good-natured-looking old Gentleman, shutting up his telescope. "Why, that's
my trusted old friend, Mr. Punch, making his half-yearly transit across the world; and"
At this moment a magnificent book shot from the heavens into the midst of the now capering throng.
"I thought so!" continued the Speaker, indicating the splendid present with satisfaction. "And that is his

A MODEL TRIAL; OR, HOW MUCH MORE OF IT?
This was the four hundred and seventeenth day of the hearing
of this important case. The interest of the puhlio in the proceedings
showed no signs of abatement, and the Court, as
in former years, was crowded in every nook and
corner by a highly select and aristocratio audience.
On taking his Beat on the Bench, Mr. Baron
Bubblesome, who seemed in excellent spirits,
ordered an additional row of stalls to be added to
the Bench, in order to accommodate several distin-
guished members of the Peerage who had been
awaiting his arrival.
Lord Tilbury Smudgit being reoalled, for the
fifteenth time, deposed.—I have spent a great deal
of the various intervals that have elapsed, owing
to the repeated adjournments of this trial, in con-
tinuing my dabbling a little in sculpture. I have
done a few more colossal groups; one of them political, one represent-
ing "The Struggles of the Titans." The models were all members
of the aristocraoy.
The work referred to, which consisted of thirteen figures, five-and-
twenty feet high, engaged in violent combat, was here brought
through the window into the Court, and placed on the Counsel's
table.
Baron Bubblesome. Ah, they are excellent likenesses, Lord
Tilbury, every one of them. (To the Jury.) As Lord Tilbort
Bmudgit says, they are all likenesses of members of the aristocracy.
I have known them personally, and can compliment him thoroughly
on his success.
Fifty-second Expert (steps into witness-box, and, in aniwer to the
first question, replies). I am a Musio-Master.
Mr. Baron Bubblesome. Pardon me, but what is the object of
calling this Witness t
Sir Hardly Differd, Q.C. May it please your Ludship, as it has
been stated in the alleged libel that the Plaintiff laoks accomplish-
ments, we are calling Witnesses to prove that, on the contrary,
he is a most accomplished gentleman.
. •*£■ -Baron Bubblesome {waving his hand). Oh, I see; but as
t u i jln, nas ka.cl the honour of shaking hands with an Earl,
I should almost have thought such a course unnecessary. (Smiles at
the Jury.) Eh, Gentlemen?
Sir Hardly. I am afraid, my Lud, with all respect, that I must
press the point.
Mr. Baron Bubblesome (with elaborate politeness). Oh, very well!
(Expert is about to continue.) Allow me. It seems that this
gentleman is a Music-Master? (Expert bows.) You play the
big-drum? (Same business.) Then I will myself test your pro-
ficiency. (Loud applause in Court.) If you will kindly follow me
into my private room, I will, at a considerable sacrifice of personal
convenience, carry out my intention. ( With intense courtesy.) The
Court stands adjourned until I have learned to play the drum—the
big-drum! (Great applause, amidst which his Ludship retires. For
some time a loud banging is heard, when the Judge and the Witness
return.) I have satisfied myself that the Witness is a perfeot
master of the instrument, I have selected. He has made me as pro-
ficient a performer as himself. (Loud applause.) And now, Sir
Hardly, we will goon. {Smiles at the Jury, and wares his hand
with extreme courtesy.) As the Plaintiff has had the honour of
shaking hands with an Earl, I scarcely think these Witnesses are
necessary; but we will go on.
Fifty-third Expert called.
Fifty-third Expert. I am a Professor of Athletic Exercises.
Mr. Baron Bubblesome. Pardon me, I will pursue the course I
have already followed. (Courteously to Jury.) At great pergonal
inconvenience, I will test this gentleman's proficiency in ground and
lofty tumbling. I, myself, will receive instruction in the flving-
trapeze. (Great applause, during which his Ludship and Expert
retire. Sounds of heavy falls, and loud groans. After a long
pause they return—his Ludship rubbing his back painfully.) I find
that this Witness is most expert in the businesses of leaping, which
have been his especial study. I have been caused great personal
inconvenience. (Murmurs of sympathy.) Really, considering that
the Plaintiff has shaken hands with an Earl—(Smiles at, and bows to
Jury.) But we will go on—go on.
[Other Experts are examined, and Mr. Baron Bubblesome
takes lessons in Horsemanship, Comic Singing, Amateur
Cookery, and Salmon Fishing. Trial adjourned over
another vacation.

prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law, and, if
possible, shot.
9. Any commanding-officer who fails to carry out the
spirit, as well as the letter of these regulations, will be
recommended to Her Majesty for immediate execution;
or, at least, to banishment for a term of not less than one
hundred years, or the natural term of his life.
10. Nothing shall, in future, be bought for the mess
except necessaries. The commanding-officers, in conse-
quence, will never sanction the purchase of tooth-picks,
finger-glasses, and table-napkins.
11. Before -giving over the command of a regiment or
battalion, the commanding-officer shall swear, on the
bones of his ancestors, that the mess does not owe more
than fourpence-halfpenny.
12. In the event of the mess owing more than four-
pence-halfpennv on the change of a command, the retiring
commanding-officer shall explain fully the reasons for
the indebtedness, and swear, on the bones of his
ancestors, that the liabilities of the regiment are well
under sixpence. If he is unable to do this, he will not be
recommended for any further employment or promotion.
13. A Lieutenant-Colonel on assuming the command of
a regiment or battalion, will forward a report to the
general officer commanding, saying that he has, or has
not, found that his predecessor was guilty of insolvency
or fraud, and intimating his complete satisfaction with
all the above useful, polite, and soldierly regulations.
•WARRIORS IN A NICE MESS!
The following general order, in addition to the one already issued upon the
subjeot of Mess Expenses by the Commander-in-Chief, is hourly expected to be
circulated:—
1. The monthly mess bills will be paid on or before the 7th of each succeeding
month. Any officer neglecting to comply with this regulation will at onoe have
his effects sold by public auction, and be called upon to resign his commission
for the benefit of his brother officers, being junior to himself, who will settle
amongst themselves, in equal proportions of so many days' pay, the deficit.
2. Before any officer goes out for a walk, after parade, he will make a
declaration upon oath that he has paid for his breakfast.
3. Commanding officers, with a view to disoountenanoing, in every way, all
extravagant living amongst their officers, will frequently substitute, for their
ordinary dinners, an egg with their teas. . .
4. The custom in some regiments of asking a guest in to lunch, is stnotly
forbidden in future.
5. Balls, and all other expensive regimental entertainments, can only be
given on the responsibility of officers commanding corps, who will obtain the
E emission of the General commanding the district, which will be countersigned
v the Deputy-Assistant-Adjutant General, after being submitted to the Chief
of the Pay Department, acting in consultation with the representative of the
Chaplain-General. Officers refusing to contribute to the expenses will receive
tljd special countenance and protection of their Colonels, who will take care to
fUpply them with a month's shooting, or a fortnight's fishing, at their own cost,
as a small reward, in recognition of their esprit de corps, hospitality, and
generosity. , .
6. Expenses of all entertainments that may be allowed, will be submitted to
the General officer at his annual inspections, and an abstract of the accounts will
be published in the local journals, for the information of the regimental guests.
7. All mess accounts will be audited monthly, writs against the Mess Com-
mittee being issued, at the same time, for all outstanding aooounts. To carry
this regulation into effect more easily, officers of the sheriffs of the county will
be ex officio honorary members of the mess.
8. Any officer presenting the mess with a silver tea-spoon, or an electro-
plated lucifer-box, on the occasion of a first appointment or promotion, will be
A SONG EOR THE SEASON.
We 're getting along with the Season!
Three weeks, and the How will be clear;
There surely must be some good reason
For holding our London so dear.
Ma belle you 've been duly presented,
The papers have printed your names,
Mamma was supremely contented,
And orowds thronged the street of St. James.
And now come the out-of-town dinners,
"At homes," with the crush on the stairs,
Of witty and wicked old sinners,
And young ones who give themselves airs.
How Fashion's kaleidoscope changes,
In Park, PiocadiUy, PaU Mall;
When many a maiden arranges
Her future—how fare you, ma belle t
"I 've lived and have loved," said the poet.
And you, while you live, do you love?
Is one face, though scarcely you know it,
All the other new faces above?
Is one voice more sweet than all voices?
Does one hand weave magical spell?
The heart that loves wisely rejoices—
How iB it with you, then, ma belle t
Unless you keep troth, as a maiden,
In even this era, may do,
Unless with no false vows you 're laden,
Unless you are honest and true,
In spite of the pearls and the coral,
Or diamonds, trust me, ma belle,
You '11 weep o'er the bitter old moral—
"Lejeu ne vaut pas la chandelle!"
SCRUTTON f. TAYLOR.
The result of this Scruttony into the case affecting the
St. Paul's Industrial School was that Miss Taylor had
to pay a thousand pounds damages, and " was lustily
cheered by the crowd on her leaving Court." This was
cheering, of course; but only a large subscription will
be consolatory as compensation. Sir Henry Hawkins,
who in hot weather could stifle Justice herself in his
Court, if she couldn't sit with all the windows closed,
might have adorned his speeoh with this moral, addressed
to Miss Taylor :—
"Though justly indignant, pray don't interfere.
Unless you have got the right pig by the ear.

CETEWAYO'S COMING!
What 'll thry do with him ?" No Reasonable Offer rkfused.'
Improvement and ho Z>. r.-KHiORATioif.—Opening in State of
the new Daily Telegraph Offices last Wednesday, when Royal High-
nesses, Grand Transparencies, Excellencies, General Brilliances, and
All the Talents were sumptuously entertained from ten at night till
any time the next morning. "Machinery and Music" were com-
bined, though a band was scarcely required, seeing what a " power-
ful Organ" the Proprietors of the D. T. possess on their own
premises. Ladies were shown the separate loose boxes where the
leaders are kept, and the stall where Pegasus stands ready saddled
and bridled for the most daring journalist. The room where "Arnold's
Exercises" are written attracted much attention, and the D. T. special
composer, Signor AK-Di-TijWas much interested in visiting the "com-
positeurs " department. The Electric Light was rendered almost
unnecessary by the presence of " G. A.S.," whose brilliant reflections
will make memorable the brightest days of the I). T. as the George
Augustan Era of Journalism. "Great crowd," observed a Noble
Duke, who, from his interest in the Fire Brigade, is generally sup-
posed to be ready to throw cold water on everything, and desirous
of even putting out the " Grand Old Man." "Great crowd," re-
peated a certain Royal Personage, adding, as he turned to the
Proprietor-Editor, "in fact quite a Levee-Lawson."
Cakes and Customs.—Foreigners visiting Richmond should be
always recommended to try the favourite food of the natives—those
little cakes called Maids of Honour. And when they visit Windsor
they should be careful to show their thorough acquaintance with
English manners and customs by ordering at dessert several cakes
of Old Windsor. Taken with water, on a dusty day, they are
highly recommended by the faculty.
Mr. Augustus Harris will probably engage Cetewayo to appear
as Othello for a few weeks. Why not the Jersey "Lillie" for
Desdemona t Here's a chance!

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.




"THE NOES-ES HAVE IT."
[The writer of From the Cross Benches, in the Observer, has drawn attention to the eye-glasses of the House of Commons, through which individual
Members take their peculiar views of public affairs. The "Ayes " having had it " with glasses round," our Artist has let the "Noes" have it. The
public will find little difficulty in apportioning each nose to its rightful owner, as in every instance the correct tip has been given.]
House of Commons, Monday Night, June 26.—Great rush on
Chaplin to-night. Always the case now when there comes up geo-
graphical question. Everybody turns to Chaplin. The thing to
know is, where's Birkenhead, and how to get there? Overmastering
desire to see the place that has returned Mr. MacIvek as its repre-
sentative. Some difficulty in finding Chaplin. Mind distracted by
the affairs of Europe. Still, always accessible to humble querists.
Ever ready to impart useful information.
"Birkenhead, he says, "is a one-howe place situate on the
Mersey, a river which runs from land to sea, through Runcorn and
other salubrious rural districts."
Lot of men going down. Spend Saturday to Monday, thoroughly
examine the place, and make acquaintance of the singular people
who live there. Meanwhile, have MacIver with us, more than ever
like Jack-in-the-Box, popping up every two minutes at question
time with intent to move Adjournment. The Speaker, who takes
a fatherly interest in young men, did his best to save the youth, but
no use. Egged on by Members near him, who are always ready for
a lark.
"It's that young; rascal, Hicks, that's at the bottom of this,"
Habcourt says, with trained faculty for getting at the root of
conspiracies.
MacIver on his legs, gets in a word occasionally edgewise amid
the uproar. Howled at impartially from both sides. Cheered on by
the humorous Hicks.
It was when he sat down that there was a rush for Chaplin, to
get to know all about Birkenhead. Business dune.— Obstruction.
Tuesday Morning,—We are a great business assembly, and a
pattern to the world. Wasted our time till. Midnight, then set to
work. Then Westminster saw another sight. Speaker ill, and
no wonder. But nothing oan tame the restless spirit of Lyon
Playpair, nor sap his monumental energy.
"Could you manage without me in the morning, Playfalr?"
Speaker asked; "got a bad cold. Dr. Lyons (whose address still
the same), ordered me to put my feet in hot water, and head out
of the window for half-an-hour. It's a little hard on you; but,
if you don't mind"
"Why, cert'nly," said the Leonine Playfalr. "Gosset not very
well, either, and he may as well go. I can manage to be Speaker,
Chairman of Committees, and Sergeant-at-Arms all at same time."
But Captain Gosset would not go. "Bradlaugh might come,"
said the indomitable man-at-arms, "and I would not be absent from
my post."
So Lyon Playfair's ambition was limited to the accomplishment
of the dual office of Speaker and Chairman of Committees. A
beautiful Bight to see him hopping from Speaker's chair to his own,
according as the House was in Committee, or sitting in full estate.
"Corsican Brothers nothing to it," said Sir Erskine May, look-
ing on, full of admiration. "The man who rides two horses at the
same moment of no account."
"Reminds me," said Hakcourt, as Lyon Playfair skipped back-
wards and forwards, whilst the young day looked in and blinked
with astonishment, of the early bird trying to catch the worm."
Business done,—Votes in Supply.
Wednesday Afternoon. — Distinguished visitor turned up this
afternoon. Had on a robe of deer -skin trimmed with fur, eminently
suitable for Midsummer day: a belt beautifully beaded; a head-
dress of the feathers of the eagle; whilst his legs were decently covered
with trousers, conveniently ornamented with rows of deer-hoofs.
Every Btephe took tremendous jingling. Thought first it was the
coppers in his pocket. Found it was the deer-hoofs rattling.
Evelyn Ashley introduced me to him. Gentleman's name Wah-
btjn-ha-kee; and he's " chief of the Munoey or Wolf tribe of the
Red Indians" {vide Daily News). Seems the Readlndians, having red
up all Fenimoke Cooper's novels, have gone in for Captain Mar-
ryatt. Wah-bun-ha-kee been reading Japhet in Search of a
Father. Thought he 'd be "Wah-bun-ah-kee in Search of a
Son "—not actual son, but one of the tribe of which old Wah is
Chief. Drcmmond, however, not here to-day: absent on State
business.
Conversation of old Gentleman with the trousers rather peculiar.
He says, when Ashley introduced me :—
"Ha-Ha, Toby, Punchy-Wunchee,
Have you seen my Drum-Mond-
Wolff-Ee F
On the shores of Qitche Oumee
Of the shiniug Big-Sea-Water
Stands Nortti-Cote-Ee, Grand Old
Woman,
Pointing with her finger westward,
O'er the water pointing westward
To the purple clouds of sunset.
If I find my Drum-Mond-Wolff-Ee,
Son of Keneu, great war-eagle,
I would say unto him Thus-Ly:
'Bring your bow, 0 Drum-Mond-
Wolff-Ee,
Bring your arrows jasper-headed,
Bring your war-club. Puggawangun,
And your mil tens, Minjekahum,
And your birch canoe for sailing,
And the oil of Miske-Hahma.
Leave your Gorst and Come-Along-O-
Quit your Randolph-Church-a-Lily.
Never mind terse Dilky-Wilk-y
And the Gib-Er-Al-Ter Quest-yon,
Or your Bug-A-Boo Glads-Stoney.
Come back to your own good people,
Wah-bun-ha-kee, chief of Wolff-
Ees,
With his deer hoofs Jing-Ly-Ing-Ly.
Long I 've sought you, Mishe-Hahma,
Come back to your home, your people,
Live among them, toil among them,
Clear the fishing-grounds and rivers,
Slay all monsters and magicians,
Dilky-Wilk-y, Glad-Stee-Onyes.'
'Minne-wawa,' said the pine-trees,
'Mudwy-arhke,' said the water.
Now, then, Toby, Punchy-Wunchee,
Tell me where is Drum - Mond -
Wolff-Eef"
"Don't know," I said, perhaps a little shortly. Distinguished
Foreigner's conversational style, like his name and his deer-hoofs,
a trifle too polysyllabio for me.
"Oh, very well," said the dark gentleman in trimmed trousers,
evidently a little hurt. "I '11 call to-morrow."
And he stalked off, jingling, " God Bless the Prince of Wales"
with his deer-hoofs. Business done.—Obstruction.
Thursday Night.—All sorts of rumours current about the Con-
ference. Baron de Works full of information. After all, Dilke
the only safe man. Go and ask him. Found him in his room behind
Mr. Speaker's chair, where he smokes long cigars, and conooots
short answers. Busy with the Times.
"Anything fresh about Conference to-day?"
"Just looking," said Dilxk. "Always read the Paris Corre-
spondent of the Times when I want to know anything about Foreign
Affairs. Learn more there than is to be found at the Foreign Office.
Sometimes Blowitz is a little hampered with his responsibilities.
Can't tell all he knows, for fear of European complications. But,
on the whole, does pretty well. Ashmead-Bartlett a mere chicken
oompared with him, and Worms an ignoramus. Fact is, Blowitz
is the Grand Old Man of English journalism. Have a cigar P Not
just now P Well, 'oh reevor,' as Biqgar said to the maiden lady
when he quitted Paris, not meaning to return.''
All very well this. But Dilke hasn't answered my question
about the Conference. Begin to think there's more in complaints
against his answers than I thought.
Business dune.— Obstruction.

THE SPENDTHRIFTS GUIDE.—No. L
Thx art of Money-grubbing has been so much exalted for asany
and has even been raised to the level of a cardinal virtue,
the softened title of "Self-Help,'' that perhaps it would be
well to recognise the existence of the opposite quality, aad to publish
a few wards of advice for the guidance of Spendthrift*. Every man
who has money is not bom with the talent for spending it well; aad.
even if he possess this talent, it may be improved by judicious
teaching. Let us teach.
Our first lesson shall be on keeping a Yacht. This form of money-
spending is simply ridiculous. Not one man in a hundred gets any
real enjoyment out of it. unless enjoyment can be got out of feeling
always uncomfortable, if not absolutely ill: and in watching the ruddv
faces of an idle crew, who are eating and drinking, and being clothed
at your expense.
Oar second lesson shall be on keeping Hones. The horse is a noble
animal, honest and truthful as a Newfoundland dog, but the same
cannot be said of those who deal in him, and look after him. Horse-
dealers, stablemen, grooms, and helps are not influenced by the
horse's nature, and a " horsey " man generally is a man not to be too
much trusted. Those who keep horses spend much money for the
profit, and often for the enjoyment of other people; and, out of fifty
riders, there is probably only one who really understands and enjoys
horse-riding, and is not in perpetual fear ot breaking his neck, even
if he is lucky enough to escape a " cropper."
Locomotion we admit to be necessary, and locomotion is only
brought to its highest state of perfection on English Railways. The
first rude attempt at luxury and comfort in travelling is the Saloon-
Car. Oar recommendation to the Spendthrift is to have a private
travelling carriage, fitted by the most artistic and expensive
upholsterers of the day, provided with a bath-room, sleeping-berths,
a wine-cellar, a portable kitchen, a drawing-room, a dining-room, a
servants' room, a luggage-box, and any further convenience which
highly-paid ingenuity can suggest. This car fitted on to the network of
railways, and worked on a mileage arrangement with the companies,
would form a most agreeable money-spending machine, the invita-
tions to which would be more coveted than any invitations for a
cruise in the Cyclone. One day at Brighton, the next in the High-
lands, and the next on the ooast of Cornwall—these are only a few of
the enjoyments which such a carriage would bring within the reach
of a select number. An Italian cook, a small private band, a barbt r.
an artist, and a descriptive writer ought to form part of the travelling
staff, and every care ought to be taken to make the journeys as
expensive as possible. If the Spendthrift is not equal to the direction
of so much outlay, he should select, as manager, a head-servant from
some embarrassed family of distinction. By all means let him avoid
the mistake of taking his servants from millionnatret, unless he
wants a walking embodiment of Poor Richard"! Almanack.
Last week Cambridge showed a good front to Oxford, with three
Studds in it. Cantab motto just now, "The proper Studdy of man-
kind is Cricket."

"Prophetic utterance," in his celebrated letter, dated VoL vii.,
p. 169, 1844, when Master Basil was only three years old, is no
prophecy at all, we simply reply, that they have yet to learn the
rules which regulate the discernment of all prophecy, and to under-
stand the distinction between a "prophecy," which this did not
claim to be, and a "prophetic utterance," which this undoubtedly
was. "Basil" for "Basil's brother," would have been suffi-
ciently explioit for any ordinary "prophetic utterance," the name
of "Basil" being typical rather than personal. But beyond this
there is a special key to any "prophetic utterance " of Mr. Punch's
which is peculiarly applicable in this instance, and it is this:—Mr.
Punch conceals truth beneath jest. "Basil" was written in jest;
the truth had to be sought for; and so when he wrote Basil, he
meant Basil to be taken Ernestly. Verb. sap.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
.'MODERN LIFE IN LONDON: OR, "TOM AND JERRY" BACK AGAIN.

THE TRIO AT HENLEY REGATTA.
It was about the beginning of July when our Trio began to find
themselves a leetle overdone with the gaiety of " Life in London."
They had "seen life " with the best of the Goes, and, as Young
Logic said, had waked up some of the " boys," who in return had
taken them round, and pronounced the two Old Cocks, as they de-
nominated the Corinthian and Jerri Hawthorn, Esq., to be
"all there when the bell rung." "I am not au fait with that flash
expression," said Tom when this compliment was first conveyed to
him, but if it means that my Coz and 1 are still game to enjoy the
lark, laugh at the tpree, and be alive when a Ramble is proposed, I
can assure you that we can still take credit for perusing with the
most marked attention the grand living Book of Books,
MAN 111"
That was undoubtedly true; but still, to "make a clean breast of
it," we must say that "Modern Life in London" had begun to
tell upon the Trio. Young Bob had been for some time in a highly
crapulous condition, and was observed on more than one occasion to
fortify himself before breakfast with a wineglatsful of "Worcester
Sauce," a plan for obviating the Blue Devils, which had been taught
him by a young friend named Skhgii's, late a shining light in a
Hussar Regiment. Tom and Jerky were seasoned casks; but while
in " old days " they were accustomed to sluice a few glasses of good
old wine over their ivories after dinner, and to "hold their own"
when the bottle went merrily round, they were not "up" to the
perpetual pegs that seemed to be " the thing " in these days. They
■were game to take The Dustman on board after a night's jollifica-
tion, but they were "bowled out" by the matutinal " stims" which
Were tn vogue with Logic and his pals. Nor were they so eager for
the Big Cigars and everlasting cigarettes which these young heroes
puffed; while, as the Corinthian remarked, "Life in London"
was regarded through a couleur de B.-and-S. pair of barnacles,
"Right you are, old man," said Young Bob, slapping the
Corinthian on the shoulder, "and I '11 tell you what it is; we are
all getting a little played out. What do you Bay to having a spell of
fresh air on the Thames, and joining some of the Chappies at
Henley Regatta." "We are more at home," said Corinthian Tom,
"in hippie than aquatic contests, my dear Bob; but take us wherever
Life is to be seen, and we are 'on,' as you say:" while Jerry
acquiesced, for he was "making tracks" for Point Nonplus, and
felt as if the mere mention of another Brandy-and-Soda would cause
him to see spiders! So the Trio agreed to try " The River," and it
was admitted on all hands that this was the month of all others in
whioh one ought to be on the bosom of Father Thames. They sur-
rendered themselves, therefore, to the whim of the moment, for
Pleasure was the sole target at which they aimed, and a few fleeting
hours found them moonmg at Marlow, wandering at Wargrave,
spooning at Shepperton, chatting at Chertsey, dawdling at
Datchet, flirting at Formosa, bathing at Bisham, fishing at Fair-
ford, paddling at Pangbourne, swimming at Sonning, walking at
Walton, smoking at Surbiton, talking at Twickenham, or revelling
at Richmond. Our Trio agreed that no one could see Life in
London without a day on the River, which has found its own painter
in Keeley Halswelle, and its limner in Leslie, while what says
Ashby-Sterry, the Laureate of the Thames, in his poem on" Blank-
ton Weir," a title which Young Bob said always reminded him of
bad language. We have taken some small liberties with the verses :—
"Oh, jolly July afternoons, when leaving bores and bilLs,
We rowed with pantaletted pets in furbelows and frills:
We brimmed the beaker with champagne and crowned the cheerful cup,
And heard her gentle accents eay, 'Now, Job, do " liquor up "!'
Come back those days of curls and girls, and flirting without fear,
As show these rhymes of spoony times about old Mankton Weir!"
While " on the river," Tom, Jerry, and Young Logic of course
"did Henley," and the two former were loud in praise of the
pleasant old town and of the famous Regatta, which, as Bob truly
said, might be held to resemble an aquatic Ascot. For there the
fashionables congregated intent on the races provided for their
amusement, whether it was the Grand Challenge Cup, or the Stew-
ard's, the Silver Goblets, or the Diamond Sculls, the Ladies' Chal-
lenge Plate, or the Visitors' Cup. It was indeed a charming sight
—when they got clear of a few Snobs, who bring such otherwise
undeserved odium on Launches—and one worthy of the pencil of
the artist—for dainty damsels in diaphanous dresses, were attended
by " gay Cavaliers," and all the "Upper Ten" seemed to have hied,
from the West End to the River. Jerry, who, as we know, was a
great admirer of The Sex, kept so constantly looking from side to
Bide, as each fair Syren met his enraptured gaze, that the
Corinthian jokingly remarked that his Coz had better take care, or
his eyes would wobble out of his head. "What would Mary Rose-
bud say," added Tom, who had dipped his nose into The Cup pretty
often, but Jerry smiled, and made no articulate reply. It is needless
to say that The Trio saw all the " Fun of the Fair." They lounged on
the lawn of The Lion, rowed on Thr River, roy tiered at Remenham,
pic-nicked with perpetual parties, and lunched, as Young Bob said,
"All over the shop." Indeed, Tom and the Corinthian began to
feel as they were rowed home, that, whatever might be the advan-
tages of Life on the Riveb, it was quite as capable of sewing you
up as Life in London.
"labge by degrees, and hideously big."
Three sizes are, it is said, now kept for sale at Ladies' Outfitters.
They are known severally as "Crinolette," "Crinoletter," and
"Crinolettest." It is rumoured there is even a greater monstrosity
to be obtained; namely, the "Crinolettissimus." Let us hope the last
rumour is devoid of foundation.
Sub Judice.—The libel against Mr. Belt is, that, as he can't
sculpt, he chisels. Pity it couldn't have been taken during the
silly season. More Judges wanted. Great loss to the newspapers,
and therefore most inconsiderate of the Last of the Barons. It has
been so far interesting and amusing. The appearance of every bust
in Court being the signal for another bust of laughter.

A HANDBOOK OF KNOWLEDGE.
No. VI.—The British 'Bus.
1. Chiefly concerning the Interior thereof.
Q. What is an Omnibus?
A. A lumbering vehicle, licensed to carry a fixed number of
passengers, and to torture as many as can be crammed into it.
Q. What is the meaning of the word "carry," in this con-
nection?
A. It means simply to convey, in the sense in which luggage is
conveyed in a railway van, calves in a netted market-cart, or pigs
in a Belfast steamer.
Q. But if the vehicle is licensed to accommodate—
A. Pardon me. It is not—emphatically not. Accommodation
implies convenience, comfort, fair apportionment of space—con-
siderations which the constructors, licensers, proprietors, and
conductors of Omnibuses absolutely ignore.
Q. What, then, is their guiding principle?
A. The same as that of the linen-packer, or cargo-s tower—
namely, to get the greatest bulk into the smallest space.
Q. How is this achieved P
A. In the first place by the ingenious manner in which what is
humorously called sitting-room " is allotted.
Q. Explain how this is done P
_ A. By ignoring the doctrine of averages. For example, the
inside of an Omnibus contains barely enough sitting-room for
twelve small and spare persons, without luggage. It is licensed
to carry a dozen people, with no qualification as to bulk or
bundles.
Q. What is the result of this thoughtful arrangement?
A. That .when the vehicle is what is known as, "full inside,"
it is most commonly crammed to agonising and suffocating reple-
tion.
Q. How is this P
A. It results from two facts; one quite natural, and to be expected,
the other, phenomenal, certainly, but matter of long and conclusive
experience. The first is, that the average omnibus passenger is,
more or less, obese. The second is, that he, or she, is inordinately
addicted to big bundles. Both these facts are systematically ignored

by all connected, with the management of Omnibuses, with the result
that the many portly passengers are painfully compressed, whilst
the few spare ones are completely choked and paralysed.
Q. How do yon gain access to the interior ot an Omnibus?
A. First catch your 'Bus. This you do, if haply at all, at the cost
of prolonged shouting, delirious waving of umbrella or walking-stick,
and breathless chase through mud and muck.
Q. Are all 'Bus Conductors blind and deaf, that it is so diflloult to
arrest their attention?
A. Presumably not. But their eyes are commonly engaged with
the latest Tacinsr-returns, and their ears in straining to catch the
graphic narratives and full-flavoured facetiee addressed to them
across the roof by their drivers.
Q. Having, at length, recognised your existence, and perceived
your pursuit, does the (conductor stop his 'Bus to take you up?
A. Not necessarily. If behind time, owing to too numerous halts
at hostelriea on the road; or, if engaged in racing with a rival 'Bus,
he will probably shout to you to 'rCome along. Sirl" grab your
outstretched hand, haul y0U violently on to the high and slippery
step, thrust you headlong into the vehicle, and slam the door against
the rear of your person, with a vociferous " right behind!" which
you will be disposed to resent as ironically personal.
Q. When fairly inside, how are you received?
A. As an impertinent uitruder, and the common enemy of those
already seated.
Q What is the reason of this P
A. Nothing can be advanced which could fairly be called a reaton
for so absolutely unreasonable a state of things? But it is simple
fact that the Briton who.has got into a publio\ehiele, 0 whatever
kind, always r*^*f»^f^-^nUm, who is only trying to get in,
with unconcealed contempt and bitter aversion.
Q. How is this manifested in the present instance?
A. By the P«<fS^g!fg^™g themselves over the whole avail-
able space, ana glowering at the unhappy incomer with looks of
dark disfavour.
Q. What do you then do?
A. Totter helplessly from end to end of the 'Bus, stumbling over
the resolutely protruded knees of one, the doggedly planted umbrella
of another, and the ingeniously ambushed bag, bale, or bundle of a
third. The jolting of the vehicle causes you perhaps to tread on the
toes of a sour gentleman on one side, and possibly to tumble into the
lap of a severe spinster on the other. This elicits energetic protests,
but no attempt to "make room for you." If, in answer to your
passionate appeal or the surly summons of the Conductor, place is at
fast reluotantiy yielded to you, it is probably an inch or two of un-
comfortable sitting between the many-cornered box of a journeying
domestic and the plethoric basket of a travelling washerwoman.
Q. When you have fairly settled down, what next happens P
A. A final and unusually bulky " fare " enters, and "jamming"
down between you and the next sitter, hides you from human ken,
reducing you at the same time to a condition of utter breathlessness
and absolute immobility both of body and limb.
Q. What next occurs?
A. The Conductor at once Beizes this moment to thrust his head
in at the door, and demand the immediate production of your fare.
Q. What is the effeot of this?
A. A frenzied and prolonged struggle of olosely-wedged and
bundle-hampered people to get at inner pockets and inaccessible
purses, productive of Buch physios! discomfort and mental distress
as all but cynical despisers of their kind would gladly draw a veil
Q. Could not these troubles and tortures be at all mitigated?
A. Most of them could be entirely avoided by the simple hut
untried plan of allotting to each " fare " just sufficient room to move,
to breathe, and to get at his pockets in.
Q. Why is this obvious course not taken? ,_ . ,
A. Because proprietors, from interest, and the puhlio, from long
usage, regard that as "passenger-accommodation" whioh is really
only pilchard-packing.

"0 RARE BEN!"
We hope that the prominent supporters of the newly-started
Aotors' Benevolent Fund will do their best to sweep away the
benefit system, which, as a remnant of the time when the Aotor was
a " vagabond," is a disgrace to a "profession " whose members are
so anxious to see themselves ranked on a level with the members of the
recognised professions who dono< take benefits. The theatrical persons
really requiring benefits are the poorer brethren on the stage, who
don't get them, and who have to be content with "ticket nights."
Only the wealthy comedians and tragedians are the recipients of
benefits; and how they have in any way deserved them we utterly
fail to see.
Sometimes this appeal ad misericordiam which the poverty-stricken
Actor, who is earning not more than from three to four thousand
a-year— poor fellow !—makes to the soft-hearted public, is styled, in
a light and airy sort of way, a " Complimentary Benefit." What
this may exactly mean—beyond meaning a pocketful of money to
the bintflciaire—it is difficult to say, as the " compliment" is paid by
the Actor to himself, since it is he who starts the idea, fixes the
dates, and makes all the arrangements for extracting an extra sum
from the pockets of the theatre-going public. If it were styled a
"Complementary Benefit," it would be a little nearer the truth.
On such occasions, some of the "elite of the Profession " kindly
give their services to their nnfortunate brother-Actor,— the poor
beggar with three thousand a year,—who, when their benefits come
round, will assist them as they have assisted him. Such kind, dis-
interested, generous people! Sometimes, so urgent are the needs of
the hardly-used Actor, who takes this means of adding to his scanty
capital of perhaps about eighty thousand pounds carefully invested,
that the "Complimentary Benefit" will extend over a matinie and an
evening representation; and the usual modest theatrical advertise-
ments will inform the public, on the day in question, that "all the
seats are taken," which, in other words, means that the poor
struggling Actor, for whose "benefit" our charitable sympathies
have been aroused, is calculating on netting a big sum by his
appeal. Were the Benefit a spontaneous tribute, offered by a
sympathising public to a deserving Actor in pecuniary difficulties,
we should not have one word to say against it, but everything
in its favour. Such an event would be, in the present state of
theatrical affairs, an exception. But against the existing system of
Benefits, a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observ-
ance, we, in the best social interests of the Theatrical Profession,

ROMANY RYE AND ITALIANY RI-STORI.
Any one who at this time of year may he in want of change of
scene, cannot do better than visit the Princess's Theatre, to see the
Romany Rye, in whioh the changes of scene are really a triumph of
this department of Stage-craft. "Craig's-Nest" is one of Mr.
Beverly's master-pieces; and Messrs. Smith, Hall, and Hann
have done their very best.
Our Mister Beverly
Has very cleverly
Painted a beautiful Scene in Act One,
Messrs. Smith, Hall, and Hann
Have done all that they can.
But the Romany Rye, like their colours, won't run.
The merit of the piece is that, come in when you will, yon are safe
to see something
melodramatically
exciting, and you
can leave after
you 've seen it
without feeling
the slightest in-
terest in what

immediately to shout, "Whatever it costs, she must be saved! or 1

"Once on the deck of the Porpoise, the proofs destroyed, and the
will burnt, the gy-urrl is in my power 1" and on we go again to the
next sensation scene. The best written part in it is that of Boss
Knivett, capitally played by Mr. George Bakrett.
We were never more thoroughly taken in than by the Edward
Marsden of Mr. Mabkby, whom at first we had set down for a
middle-aged, amiable, and highly respectable cavalry officer, but
who proved to be as
big a scoundrel as was
ever let loose on society.
As he developed gra-
dually into a full-
blown villain, employ-
ing " bashers to do for
the virtuous hero, we
were lost in admiration
of the Art whioh had
so cleverly deceived us;;
and even when he was
found out and collared
by police in plain
clothes, we should still
have been ready, in
spite of the most daring
evidence to the con-
trary, to assert his
intense respectability.
We are sorry to think 'that the Author forced him to confess his
own guilt and his accomplice's as well.
Mr. Wilson Barrett is perpetually posing as the Deus ex
machind, and is so often rescuing Gertie Heckett from imminent peril,
that it is no wonder this accumulation of " little savings should tell
at last, and that, changing her name to Hearne, she becomes His n.
"Madame Ristori, with a powerful Company," at Drury Lane.
It is a powerful company, physically, at least, as there are no finer
Actors—no, beg pardon, we should sav finer men—on the stage, than
Messrs. William Rignold of the Heavy Weights, J. K. Barnes,
of the barn-shakers, H. R. Teesdale, and last, though not by any
means least, being quite six feet high, and big in proportion, Mr.
Arthur Dacre, whose costume, as Malcolm, appeared to have been
arranged for ballet purposes without the sanction of the Lord
Chamberlain, who, of oourse, could have had no idea that the part
of Young Malcolm was likely to be turned into that of "The Dancing
Scotchman." Only the absence of the bagpipes prevented Mr. Dacre
from showing that he was the Scotch youth who must have his fling,

unearthly shrieks, at a moment's notice. Capitally put on the stage
by Mr. Harris, but where were the bagpipes P
Mr. William Rignold was immense as Macbeth; his lungs are in
excellent order, and he did such justice to his fine voice, as to suggest
that he should be styled the " ' boi' of this show." Unfortunately
for him, Mr. Baknes played Macduff with so much point—to his
sword—that, on Wednesday night, ne managed to pink Macbeth,
and put him hors de combat. We are glad to say the wound is not
serious.
Seldom has the gentle and ill-fated Scotch Monarch found a better
representative than in Mr. Arthur Mathison, who made him-
self up after the model of King David in the stained - glass
window of a Gothic Church. Had he only been accompanied t>y a
harp—or, rather, had he brought it on himself—(for if he had
"brought it on himself," it would have been, evidently, his own
responsibility, and nothing to do with Mr. Harris)—he might have
played one of his own compositions, words and musio—and then—
ah! on seoond thoughts, in that case, he wouldn't have been Duncan,
(unless as an advertisement for " Doncan Davison & Co.," Music
Publishers)—and so, on the whole, Mr. Matthison was quite right.
Taking him in profile, there was
just a suggestion 'of Shylock—
an amiable Shylock with white
locks, which was quite in keeping
with the combined notion oil
Hebrew monarchy and Scottish
thrift.
With such a powerful company
it would have been better to have
given Madame Ristori a chance
quite alone. She was overweighted
by Mr. Macbeth: she was ham-
pered by everybody; and the house
was wearied and worried by the
time her great opportunity arrived.
At the commencement, alone and
without Macbeth, she was admir-
able; but with what was, some
years ago when she first played the
sleep-walking scene in English at
the Opera Comique, a wonderful
performance, we were, we regret to say, sadly disappointed, lhe
actress now requires a smaller house and a smaller stage; and only
those scenes in which Lady Macbeth appears should have been
performed. m a..i 1| ,

THE BENEFIT NUISANCE.
{Forthcoming Paragraphs in the Daily Papers.)
Following a precedent set him by his histrionic brothers, the celebrated
Mr. Wigblock, (j.C, has determined to give one performance for his own
advantage. The learned gentleman will be supported at the matinie (which
it fixed to take place in the large Court of the Old Bailey) by an enormous
amount of forensic talent. Wishing to show their respect to the binificiaire,
Mr. Justice Hawk (the well-known Member of the Judicial Hanging Committee),
Mr. Serjeant Valentine (the amusing cross-examiner), and many others, will
put in an appearance. The entertainments will include a screaming Breach of
Promise Case and an exciting Trial for Murder. Tickets will be supplied by
Mr. Wigblock and the Ushers of the Court. All the places on the Bench
have already been secured, and there seems every probability that the popular
Queen's Counsel will find the interesting occasion not only highly complimentary
but exceedingly lucrative.
His Grace the Primate, at the request of a number of Clerical admirers,
has consented to take his first Benefit in the Cathedral attached to his archi-
diocese. His Grace on this occasion will be supported by the Bishops of
Margate and Ramsgate, and the mirth-provoking Archdeacon of Herne Bay.
The entertainments will include selections from several Oratorios, interspersed
with short sermons by the most popular preachers. Plans of the Cathedral may
be seen at all the libraries, where tickets for the best places are now on sale.
His brother Offioers wishing to show their respect to Field-Marshal Sir
Wellington Snooks, G.C.B., G.S.I., &c, &c, have determined upon organising
a Grand Review and Sham Fight for his Benefit, which will be under the
immediate patronage of their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of
Wales and many other members of the Royal Family.
The performances will take place in Hyde Park, to which
admittance, on this occasion, will only be by tioket.
One of the '' features " of the occasion will be an amusing
scene caused by Prince Christian assuming (for the first
time) the duties of a General. Bayonet-drill in quiet and
slow time will be performed by a picked oompany from
the Household Brigade, and there will be several charges
by Light and Heavy Cavalry. The whole will conclude
with a grand March Past by thousands of Regulars,
Militia, and Volunteers. Applications for places on the
Grand Stand should be made to the D.A.-G., Horse
Guards, Pall Mall, or at the private residence of the
Field-Marshal. It promises (if olessed with sunshine) to
be a most brilliant affair. By the way, to discount the
weather, tickets of admission will be sold at double their
nominal price on the day itself.
By the persuasion of many of his medical friends, the
President of the Royal College of Surgical Physicians has
decided to take a Benefit, which will be held night and
day in the large theatre of the greatest of our leading
establishments. The bineftciare will, himself, perform
several extremely compbeated operations. The pro-
gramme will also include a short address by Dr.
Mcftr/iNZET, upon "How to Turn a Hospital to the
Best Account," and a screaming- Farce, enacted by
Students, called The Out-Patient, the Knife, and the
Young Beginners, and a reoitation, in character, by a
celebrated Dietary Physician, entitled "No Soup; or,
What I did with the Prime Minister." From the great
demand for tickets of admission, which has already arisen,
it seems highly probable that the Banker's books of the
[earned President will derive considerable benefit from
the interesting performances.
At the suggestion of "Mr. J. L.JToole, and.'many other
distinguished theatrical friends, Mr. Henry Irving has
kindly consented to take a Benefit, &c, &c.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

FUTURE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE HOUSE TOR A WEEK'S CONTINUOUS S1TT1NG.-SNUQ BERTHS FOR SEVERAL MEMBERS.
Mondat Night, July 3.—Great State Trial. Mr. O'Donnell
been saying bad words to the Chairman of Committees. House met
to-night to consider his oonduct. Rather a godsend this, as we 've
nothing else to do. Ireland settled. No eruptions in Egypt. General
business well advanced; and really, but for O'Donnell, might shut
up House. As it is, House crowded.
Prisoner refuses to plead. House taken aback. Not expected
affairs would take this particular turn. Usual thing for Irish
Members is to outrage all the decencies of debate, and then to
"withdraw," sometimes, if in gracious mood, to express regret;
whereupon tears of joy fill the eyes of the majority, penitent sinner
is embraced, and on the whole finds the proceedings bo agreeable,
and personally profitable, that he seeks earliest opportunity of
repeating them.
Mr. O'Donnell on new taok :Twon't plead. Mr. '.Warton well
up in ancient precedents, suggests the
press—not .the Morning Post, but a
tew hundred-weights of iron such as
they used in good old times to lay
upon chests of prisoners who refused
to plead. (Hence the phrase "the
Iron Chest.")
Nbwdkgate very doubtful. "The
only press laws," he says, "not too
antique for the House of Commons,
are those still kept on the books
with reference to newspapers."
Only thing to be done with O'Don-
nell was to pass sentence, and this
Mr. Gladstone, as resident Magis-
trate, proceeded to do.
"Fourteen days," says he, "with-
out option of a fine."
"Can do it on my 'ead," says
O'Donnell, not precisely in those
words, but in that polysyllabic form
in which he is accustomed to rival
the Premier himself. Some indica-
tions on the part of the prisoner to
throw his boot at head of Magistrate;
but having before him the prospect
of presently walking out, thought
better of it.
"If this goes on long, there '11 be
room enough in the House to sit down
comfortably," says Mr. Leaht, sur-
reptitiously edging Mr. Biqoar an inch higher up, and mopping his
head with his handkerchief. "If they 'd only put out Byrne, life
would begin to be tolerable." And he eyed the great girth of
his compatriot with sorrowful look.
"If they 'd only put out Leaht," Mr. Byrne muttered to him-
self, looking wistlully at the broad acres of his countryman's back,

Mr. O'Donnell gets Fourteen
Days, and is banished to the
Sandwich Islands for using
decidedly unparliamentary lan-
guage, and suggesting that the
Chairman of Committees' name
ought to be Dr. Ly-an' Flay-
uu-fair.
"what a convenience it would be!" Business done.—O'Donnell
got fourteen days. Urgency Resolution revived.
Tuesday Night.—News floating about before Morning Sitting of
intended demonstration in Palace Yard. It was said procession
would appear at the gates and claim privilege of admission. Proces-
sion would consist of two, Mr. O'Donnell in the van, and Mr.
Bradlauoh in the rear. Some trepidation in official circles. On
dit, the building is literally undermined by Police, ready to spring
out at a moment's notice. Seems a little overdone, but, as Inspector
Denning says, you never ^know what these things will lead to.
There would be no harm in Mr. O'Donnell walking up and down
Palace Yard between sandwich boards with "Fourteen Days" on
them, whilst Mr. Bradlauoh follows step by step with another board
bearing the legend " For Life." But who can say where these things
will stop? Always well to be on the safe side.
Inside, House crowded. Majority happy, for deliverance is at
hand. Urgency Resolution revived by 402 against 18. Then up and
speaks Justin M'Carthy, who declares that the high-minded
Gentlemen with whom he so curiously findB himself in company, can
take no further part in proceedings of an assembly marked by sub-
terfuge and violence. M'Carthy vanished Justin time to escape
thunderbolt held in hand of Jove in the Chair. Having shot his dart,
he walked out, followed in single file by fourteen Members. The
reckless House, instead of being overawed, laughed consumedly.
"Getting a little monotonous though, isn't it?" Harcourt said,
with a capacious yawn. "They 're always shaking the dust of the
House of Commons from their feet, but I observe they never do it
till further chance of kicking it up is cat off from them."
Presently Joseph Gillis strolled back. He had marched out with
the rest, and honestly meant to go; but, when he had seen them off
the premises, returned by circuitous road, and, entering from under
the Gallery, waB in his seat before he was noticed.
"We've walked out," Joey B. said, when expostulated with,
"and that's all right. We 've got the benefit of the stroke. Now I
oome back and oppose the Bill, so you see we get double advantage."
Joey B., as has been remarked before, is sly, dev'lish sly.
Business done.—Urgency granted. Deliverance of four hundred
Members from the yoke of twenty.
Thursday.—Mr. Healy gave notice to-night that next time it
is necessary to find a substitute for Lyon Playfair in the Chair of
Committees, he will move that Joseph Gillis takes it. House receives
the suggestion with uproarious delight. The mind's eye revels in
the pioture of Joey B. in the Chair, warning Mr. Forsteb, and
ruling Home Secretary's amendment out of order. Joseph, with
that modesty that always accompanies real capacity, rather shrinks
from the honour proposed to be thrust upon him.
"I know a little about the rules," he says, "and I'm thorrowly
up in foreign languages, including Latin and French, which, I may
sav, I know verbattim. But there 's a few of them English words a
syllable or so too much for me." This diffidence will doubtless be
overcome. J. G. is not a man to shirk duty when thrust upon him.

Besides, as he says, he 'd like to have a chance to suspend
the whole batch of Ministers at one blow.
In the House of Lords, to-night, rupture on Front
Opposition Bench. Marquis of Salisbury openly declares
himself at issue with Duke of Richmond. Subject,
Vagrancy Bill, Lord Stanhope, in charge of Bill, wants
to give the Vagrant five days if he calls a second time.
But," says the Duke, 'think of the inconvenience.
Perhaps he 'a a dinner engagement on the next day, or

would you like it yourselves, my Lords?"
"Nonsense," says the Marquis, "don't be too tender-
hearted. Great mainstay of the British Constitution used
to be washing the vagrant; but now he takes his bath
with courage. You must do something fresh. Let's
have this."
The Marquis triumphed as usual. Bill read a Second
Time, and Duke of Richmond led out sobbing as he
tenderly thought of the tramp.

Friday Night.—House adjourned at three o'clock this
morning, and met again at two. Now it's midnight, when
Members yawn, and Ministers nearly give themselves up
for dead. William, Lord Kensington, sits on the Bench,
near the doorway—'"William, Tell! " as Lord Richard
Grosvenor observes, when the Division Bell is rung,
and he wants his fellow Whip to assist in telling. At
present, William, Lord Kensington, is supposed to be
on duty at the doorway, to see fhat no Members slink out
when they ought to be in, assisting to make a House, or
save a Division. But His Lordship is fast asleep, and if
you were to ask him, could not even tell the hour. He
was here when day broke, and even Whips must sleep
sometimes. Mr. Cotes passing through the Lobby sees
his colleague, and envies him the peaceful slumber as
Members boldly walk past him, and get clear away.
So will Country, which doesn't wish further weakness
of Will to cause further weakening of Bill, or this
Liberal Session to be recorded as the Liberal Con-
Session.
Great storm in the teapot of the House. Conservatives
got a little surprise ready for him whom they affection-
ately call Weg. Had secretly gathered in their thou-
sands, formed alliance with the Whigs, swooped down on
Weg, and, in pitched battle, defeated him. Weg says
he '11 resign. General impression that sentence is incom-
plete. Means he '11 resign himself to the situation.
Business done. — Government defeated on small
Amendment to Crime Bill by 207 votes against 191.
THE SPENDTHRIFTS GUIDE.—No. II.
For the man who has more money than brains—or
who, having both brains and money, is disinclined to
exercise the first and is willing to spend the second,
—there is no occupation so costly and attractive as
keeping a Theatre. Theatres can be bought, or they
oan be rented. Buying is preferable. A Theatre that
has cost about six thousand pounds to build, with a
ground-rent of one hundred pounds a year, oan easily
be purchased for twenty thousand pounds, with a ground-
rent of two hundred pounds a year. This may be con-
sidered a good Spendthrift investment. When the
purchase is completed, it is advisable to call in architects,
decorators, and persons of taste, to see how far the
building can be re-built, and how much money it is
possible to spend upon it. The advantage of a Theatre,
as distinguished from other property erected under the
Building Acts, is that, however well you may do your
work, you may be suddenly called upon to do it over
again. A fire in a Theatre at Yokohama, stated, but
not proved, to have been built without asbestos cement,
may inspire the Board of Works and the Lord Cham-
berlain to demand a strict application of asbestos
cement, and the Spendthrift will then have the pleasure
of partially re-constructing his property. Not one of
the least attractions of Theatre-keeping to the Spend-
thrift will be the fact that the State—Imperial and
Parochial — will claim about a thousand or twelve
hundred pounds a year in rates and taxes for the liberty
of carrying on the business of grinning through horse-
collars.
While so much money is being lavished upon archi-

tects, builders, decorators, beadles, and the Government, it would be wicked not
to treat the dramatic profession liberally. The Spendthrift will appoint a " lite-
rary adviser," with the salary of an Under-Secretary of State, who will select the
most expensive scenery, properties, authors and actors. The vulgar notion that
aotors should be selected tor a piece, and a piece for actors, and that both should
be selected to supply a presumed public demand, should be left to tradesmen
and hucksters. Pieces and actors for the Spendthrift's Theatre'should be selected
for their high prices, and put upon the stage in the name of Art. The lower the
receipts, the more should this polioy be persisted in, until the Spendthrift's
Theatre takes the place of the subsidised playhouses of the Continent. When the
Spendthrift is tired of his toy, he can always get a Baronetcy by asking for it,
and the toy can be generously given to his Acting-Manager. As Acting-Managers
never act, there is little chance of the new proprietor playing Hamlet, and in all
probability he will sell the place to the Salvation Army. If the Salvation Army
buy it, they will pay about two-thirds of its market-value—as part of their
Salvation is the Salvation of money—and they will take the credit of having
abolished a Sink of Iniquity.

But rett and easy feeding."

"A set of aughty inserlent Saxon prigs," says one table.
"Contemptibul, bog-trotting, treesonabul scamps," says another.
"Tyrannical, dommyneering merjorrity," says a third.

I should think that for grand exampels of thorough good hatred,

first assemberly of Gentlemen, the House of Commons. Praps that's
why they allers begin their proceedins with Prairs.
I dessay many peeple 'ud like to know what the 25 Irish Briggunds
sed, and did, and drunk, when they was all bundled out of the
House, but no, I couldn't grattify their Lordable cureosity without
such breeches of impropriety as even a Irish labourer would blush
to ware. But this I will and do say, that if some of the poor
deseeved Fenian Cooks and Onsemades and Bricklairs Laberers as
sends their poor little shillins and arfcrowns from Ameriker for the
good as they thinks of dear old Ireland, could jest see how a good
deal of it is spent, I rayther fancy it would make 'em open their
eyes pretty wide, and keep their pusses a little closer. How any
man, calling hisself a man and a M.P., can lower hisself to such a
depth of diggerradashun as to live upon the fat of the land at the
expense of poor workin men and women over in Ameriker, is
somethink as I can't unnerstan, no, not a bit.
I calkulate as it takes about a duzzen Is. subskripshuns from poor
Irish Snrvants in Amerikey. to pay for one Bottle of Dry Hide-and-
Seek for the Honnerabel Mimber for Dung-cavern, say, and about
half a duzzen half-crown subskripshuns from poor Irish Laberers to
pay for one bottle of Click-Oh! for the equally Honnerabel Mimber
for Sly-goes.
I 'm rayther fond of igh living myself, and pretty well accoustumed
to it, but, before I 'd stoop so low as that, I 'd consent to live on
plane roaat and biled for the rest of my nat'ral, or rayther unnat'ral
life, beleeving as I do, that a humbol glass of Bitter would be
sweeter to me, if I 'd fairly earned it, than a whole Bottel of the
sweetest Click Oh! if drawn by false pretences from the pockets of
my poor hard-working misguided Countrymen and Countrywomen.

RATHER A BORE?
Or a little Foreshadowing from under the Fore Short.
The Submarine Continental Railway Company.
Another extraordinary Meeting of the Shareholders of the above
Company was held at Dover yesterday, at the temporary Offices
again being reconstructed on the foreshore, directly beneath the head
of the Admiralty Pier. Notwithstanding the opposition of the
Government authorities, and the condition of the roof, through
which the sea-water was visibly oozing in considerable volume,
there was a large attendance.
The Chairman, who had on a complete diver's costume, and was
supported by several highly respectable firms of Solicitors, briefly
explained the circumstances under which the Meeting had been sud-
denly summoned. He regretted to have to inform the assembled
Shareholders that it had been decided, as a precautionary measure,
to blow up the Tunnel, and he had, in fact, just received the usual
Government three days' notice. (Groans.) He was not surprised
at that manifestation. This would make the fifteenth time their
property had been wantonly sacrificed in a moment of inconsiderate
panic. And when he recalled with pride the fact, that during a
chequered commercial career of nine years the Company had not got
rid of its original Shareholders more than five-and-twenty times,
nor led to more than three serious invasions of these islands, he felt
that the action of the Government, in again hampering their receipts,
was not only cruel but unbasiness-like. (Loud cheers.) However,
there was nothing for it but to prepare themselves for the usual
financial crisis, and make up their minds for another ad interim call
of £175 per share. (Uproar.) Of course there would be no dividend.
(Laughter.)
A Shareholder, who said he had been ruined several times by
the enterprise already—(loud laughter)—wanted to know why they
couldn't block up the other end somewhere, and open what was left
of the Tunnel as a Submarine Warm Bath Establishment. (Hear!
hear.') When the Dutch got hold of it, the year before last, they
had almost screwed a dividend out of the concern as a Boer Saloon.
(Cheers.) If he had his way, he would sell it privately at a crisis
like the present, to some Foreign Government who would have no
possible interest in blowing it up. (Enthusiastic cheering.) They
tad not put their money into the Tunnel for patriotism, but for
fifteen per cent. His motto was "First a Shareholder, then an
Englishman." (Loud laughter.)
The Chairman said, that he felt that was the sentiment, of course,

TRAP, BAT, AND BALL.
that was animating all of them, but pointed out that there was con-
siderable difficulty in the way of giving it full and adequate expres-
sion.
Sir E. Watkin, who was swathed in flannel, and was understood
to be suffering severely from several forms of chronic rheumatism,
here rose and said, that, having devoted the last ten years of his life
to baling the Tunnel out—(roars of laughter)—he took a nobler view
of its use and destiny than that endorsed by their honourable Chair-
man. He had never gone from his original contention, that the con-
struction of this vast engineering work, in enabling him to give a
Champagne lunch continually, in turns, to all the distinguished
people in every part of the civilised world, had led to a friendly state
of feeling little short of miraculous. (Cheers.) This was the true
use of the Tunnel—(loud cheers)— and, from his really patriotic and
sooial point of view, all he could say was, the oftener it was blown
up the better. (Enthusiastic cheers.) It is true that, taking his
mid-day meal for years in a leaky and stifling atmosphere under the
bed of' the sea, had somewhat told on his health. ("No! no.'")
Still he was able to keep it up as long as he oould get anybody to
come down and take a snack with him, regardless of draughts, damp,
swimming sensation in the head, and soiatioa. (Cheers.) Give him
plenty of flannel, plenty of friends, and a good brand of Champagne,
and the Government might blow up the Tunnel again as Boon as they
liked! (Prolonged cheers.)
The Chairman here rose to move the adoption of the last Report,
and was about to put the question to the Meeting, when the chalk
roof that had been cracking somewhat ominously, suddenly fell in
with a loud crash, bringing down with it at the same time several
hundred yards of the superincumbent Admiraltv Pier. This not uu-
foreseen catastrophe necessitated as usual a rather hurried adjourn-
ment. After some slight confusion in passing the oustomary vote of
confidence in the Directors, the proceedings terminated.

SOME MORE WORDS WITH A MUMMY.
(Communicated by the Spirit of E. A. Toe.)
"Bah!" cried the Egyptian—in exoellent Coptic —pitching to
the other end of the apartment the Daily Telegraph, whioh I had
been translating to him for the past two hours.
"I am somewhat surprised at your impetuosity, said I, nufosnly.
'! Ill-bred impatience is the last thing I should have expected from
a contemporary of the Pyramids." .,..*,
"Not Time but twaddle produoes tedium," retorted the Mummy
with polished pungency. "Judging from what you have read
concerning Sultans, Khedives, Beys, and Notables, Joint Controls
and Identical Notes, Ultimatums that are not Ultimatums, and De-
monstrations that do not demonstrate.il should .say that the mazei«
Labaris was plain and simple oompared with the present muddle
of Egyptian Affairs." , . , .
"Well," said I, "contemporary riddles are a little less simple ot
solution than those of your muoh over-rated old Sphinx."
"Is Chaos then aj"oonundrum, in the modern sense r' softly
queried he, with a slow elevation of his eyebrows. "Our idea of a
riddle was a hidden problem, whioh needed wit to solve, not a pal-
pable oonfusion which contending interests wrangled over. Your
modern Sphinx seems to me more like Chimsera."
I somehow sympathised with the hasty assault of the meek man
Moses upon the countryman of my placid interrogator. I could
understand better than before the feelings of Bill Nye when he
"went for that Heathen Chinee," with the smile that (like that of
my Egyptian) was " childlike and bland."

Now, kin he dew that, Sir?!"
"Well," *aid'T, "of course, if we chose to submit to'the iron
absolutism of a Rameses, or the dark intrigues of an Ameni"
"Instead of the gentle guidance of him you call 'Bismarck, or
the frank and fair leadership of those you name 'Financiers,'"
interjected the Egyptian, smoothly. "Ah I I must admit there is one
modern mystery which we did not understand in the year 3000 B.C."
"What is that?" I asked with some eagerness.
"Bondholding," he replied, with expressive brevity.
"A simple matter," said I, airily.
"They are simple who think so." responded he, with a significant
contraction of the'sinister eyelid. "The Veil of Isis never hid
secrets so dark. Our priests never swayed influences so subtle, so
all-pervading, so unscrupulous or Jso nnsuspected as the priests of
your Temple of Mammon. Bah! I knew all about' the esoteric'
and 'the exoteric' doctrine ages ago, and am not to be duped to-day
by the hocus-pocus of financial wire-pullers."
"■ I do not quite understand ," I began.
M Certainly you do not," he interjected, "no more'than ninety-
nine hundredths of your fellows, citizens, scribes, politicians,
diplomatists do—no more than a Memphian swineherd understood
the sacred mysteries of the hermetic books! But the Masters of
Mysteries^ rule the Rulers to-day as in the time of the Pharaohs,"
he added,"enigmatically.
"A joint control," I remarked with some dignity ; "that not only
secures the interests of the Bondholders, but public and political
good in the restitution of credit, the "substitution 'of order for dis-
order, and improvement in the condition of the people ."
But here I_ paused, arrested against my will by a repetition of that
peculiar exhibition of optical contractility before alluded to.
"When a joint control does not control, and becomes disjointed."
said he, '' even an Arabi Bey may be tempted to mock at the mouth-
ing menaces of its forward and its backward voice. And as to your
roseate sequences,—credit, order, improvement,—will you demon-
strate them from the present position of affairs at Alexandria, as
illustrated by mob-massacre, the panic-stricken flight of Capital, and
the pleasant possibilities of bombardment P"
"A ' firm attitude,' " said I, "is now absolutely necessary, in the
interests of—well of evert/bod;/."
"Were your creed-shapers as picturesque and as logical as were
ours." drawled the Egyptian smoothly, yet with a pungency of
emphasis perfeotly indescribable, "they would give you a new god.
Bondholder Demiurgus to wit, and symbolically divinity yotu\triad
of tremendous potencies, the Purse, the Tongue, and"
But somehow I had lost interest in the interview, and left the
Egyptian's presence with an abruptness which I hope did not strike
him as quite too modernly ill-mannered.
THE NORTH SEA FIEND I
A despatch in a Blue Book lately issued, relative to the North
Sea Fisheries, contains the remarkable announcement that:—|
"Her Majesty's Government have learnt with satisfaction that the use of
the devil is going to be put down."
This is bad news for the Solvation Army and many other Chris-
tianly charitable persons. The Clergy generally will see their
"{occupation gone."
Mrs. Gamp, Jun., says: "Talk o' England looking after the
Sewage Canal in Egypt! They 'd much better get a new Sewage
Canal down at Barking." She is right. If something isn't done in
that direction, there '11 be a good deal more growling about Barking,
and with reason.
Mrs. Ramsbotham says Bhe has got a large book, collecting Auto-
crats, which, when everybody's dead and gone, will be very valuable.

LEAVES EROM A DETECTIVE'S DIARY.
Monday.—Received information of a murder committed in Clerk -
enwell, the handling- of which was entrusted to me. A poor job,
and not one likely to call forth my powers. It is evident that the
deceased and the man who iB suspected had long been on bad terms,
and that on the Sunday night they met and quarrelled in a narrow
lonely street. _ Passers-by saw the suspected man running off in the
direction of his house, and the deceased was shortly afterwards dis-
cover€d stabbed to the heart. In the morning I met little Spr of
the Evening Whopper, and he being a very nice and clean sort of a
man for a newspaper reporter, we had some refreshment together,
and I told him of the facts of the case. In the afternoon I proceeded
to Clerkenwell to arrest Smith, but his house was empty. He had
left no clue. The place was absolutely bare with the exception of a
copy of to-day's Evening Whopper. I see Spr has clearly stated
the facts of this case, and mentions that I am on my way to Smith's
house to arrest him. He refers to me as active, intelligent, and
deeply skilled in solving the mysteries of crime.
Tuesday.—A Blice of good luck. The cabman who drove Smith
from his house to the Railway Station, turned up late at night to
volunteer information. Smith left London by the loop-line of the
South-Western Railway. I proceeded to Waterloo, and by describing
Smith, who is a Bomewhat remarkable-looking man, owing to the
great length of his red hair and beard, ascertainedthat he had taken
a ticket for Fulwell. I returned to Scotland Yard, and reported
5rogTe8s. In Parliament Street I met Mr. Eaves of the Daily
7arce, and we had a long talk over the case. He congratulated me.
Wednesday.—Took train to Fulwell. The porter at the station
perfectly remembered the man with red hair and beard, and offered
to point out the lodgings which he believed he had taken. I accepted
the offer, and we walked together to the house. The landlady said
that a red-haired man, with a very long beard, had taken rooms
there on the Monday night, and, she believed, was in them now. I
knooked at Smith's door, but there was no answer. I turned the
handle; the door was unlocked, and I walked in. On the floor was
a quantity of reddish hair, lying on this morning's copy of the Daily
Farce, in which Mr. Eaves has described my proceedings almost
word for word as I told him. But where is Smith t The porter
only remembers one clean-shaved man, with close-cropped hair,
dressed very much as Smith was, leaving Fulwell Station this day.
We have lost the clue.
Some Weeks Later.—I hear that Smith is in Spain. He is doing;
well, having Btarted a daily paper for the benefit of the criminal
classes. He has likewise grown his hair and beard again.

MODERN LIFE IN LONDON; OR, 'TOM AND JERRY" BACK AGAIN.

YOUNG LOGIC EXHIBITS THE HARDSHIPS OF WAR TO THE CORINTHIAN AND HIS COZ.
"We have heard a good deal of The Volunteer Movement, my
dear Jbbby," Baid the Corinthian, one morning, to his Coz, and
I now see that the Citizen Soldiers or to-day are 'in Camp' at Wim-
bledon, so that I shall propose to Young Bob an excursion thither."
Corinthian Tom was in a highly patriotic mood that morning-, for
he had just been perusing a highly bellicose article in Jupiter Junior,
in which the British Lion was adjured to "wag its tail" till the
"welkin rang," and he thus continued, "It will do us good, my
dear Coz, to see how a 'Nation of Shopkeepers' is prepared to guard
the National Emporium, and I feel sure that we shall find the
inscription on the Champion's oup right when it declared that the
innovating hand of a foreigner, when lifted against the son of
Britannia, must not only be aided by the strength of a Lin.v, but
the Heart also!" "My father used to speak of the Old Volun-
teers," said Jerky; "and most of the gentry of any standing in
'our parts' held Commissions; while I have heard that there were
wet nights at Mess when these gallant fellows foregathered in our
County Town." "No doubt," said Tom; "but here comes Young
Bob. I know his hoof on the stairs. Let us see if he is 'on.'"
Young Bob, to use his own expression, was quite game, said he was
a Volunteer Officer himself, and he thought a look in at the Camp
would "freshen him up" a bit, for he hadn't felt the same fellow
since the Gaiety Company had left Town, and the Saered Lamp of
Burlesque had been extinguished. "Let us go to Wimbledon by all
means, my gay Warriors, there is much fun to be had in the tents
of the Victorias, and unrivalled is the whiskey that flows in Glen
Albyn!" "What spirits Young Bob has," said Jerry, admiringly.
"Yes," replied his Coz, "ardent BpiritB." Whereupon Bob came
as near blushing as ever he did in hisflife, and declaring it was too
bad, "'pon his honour," our illustrious
Trio started for Wimbledon.
The Common certainly presented an
animated sight as, gaining a Coign of
Vantage, our heroes looked down
upon the long lines of tents, the butts,
and the various Firing points where
the competitors were straining every
nerve to "hit the Bull's-Eye." As
they went in and out of Canvas
Town, the conversation that they heard
around them was purely professional,
and indeed appeared to the Corin-
thian and to Jerry to consist oi flash
expressions with whioh they were by
no means au fait. They heard of
patches and dummies, of outers and
magpies, bull's-eyes, and the running
man, which latter term caused the
Corinthian to remark that he thought
that a good many foreigners would be
running men, if they had to face the
accurate aim of some of the Volun-
teers of Great Britain I It must

The Tuio at Breakfast,
be said also that the weather was most unfavourable. Jupiter
Pluvius reigned Sunreme, and it was " no joke " to have to " keep
the game alive " amid heavy Bhowers and sharp bursts of wind, that
make the cleverest marksmen fire wide.
But there was another aspect of Life at Wimbledon whioh did
not escape our Trio. Young Bob, who, despite his uniform, pro-
nounced the whole affair a "bore, don't you know?" took the
Corinthian and Jerry off to have some refreshment in a pal's
tent. There our heroes saw the other side of the picture, and
were invited, like Mr. Hamlet's exceedingly shady mother, to
look upon this and that, though the result was much more pleasant
than the spectacle offered by the over-rated Bard of Avon. The
Interior of the Tent was luxurious "to a degree." It was with
its (esthetic decorations the abode of a Martial Sybarite; and the
owner, to do him justice, was in "perfeot keeping" with his sur-
roundings. He was sipping claret and inhaling the fumes of a
Turkish cigarette, and his attitude showed that the toils of "Mimic
War " did not press very heavily upon him. He was at the same
time magnificently hospitable, and the Trio enjoyed the Ne plus
ultra of Life at Wimbledon. "Happy the Warriors!" said the
Corinthian, after a number of beakers "craftily qualified," "who
thus combine War and Luxury: and when I enter the lists, be it
mine to sojourn at Wimbledon f" Nor was the " bit of life" ended
when they left the tent of their entertainer, for the London
Scottish loomed before them; and the revelry in the tents of
Glen AJbyn, lasted far into the night. Patriotic songs were sung,
and toasts were honoured in good old Scottish fashion; and
when Tom, Jerry, and Young Bob left to go home, they found
that the Dustman was "on board," and that the ways of Wimble-
don were as seductive as Life in
London.
Next morning Young Bob break-
fasted by arrangement with the Corin-
thian and his Coz, at their rooms in
Club Chambers. Tom and Jerry were
as "fresh as daisies," and had before
them huge pots of porter, and a dish
of succulent Kidneys; but Young Bob
would have "none of them;" and,
exclaiming in a very tragic fashion,
"a plague on both your houses,
was immediately supplied by the
careful waiter with a "B.-and-S."
Sic transit gloria mundi was the re-
flection of the Corinthian; but he
remembered that a Latin quotation is
apt to have the same effect upon a
"chippy" man as a "red rag on a
bull, and he, therefore, was silent:
though Jerry tipped his CouBin " the
wink," and remarked that Youni.
Bob had evidently Been too much of
Life at Wimbledon!

Abe these the Dog-days, when Star Sirius
Rising and setting with the Sun,
Should specially drive dogs delirious,
If heat can make them rabid run?
What weather for the toads and frogs,
In Dog-days raining cats and dogs!
Water enough for dogs to guzzle,
As sanest, soberest dogs are prone.
The bow-wow, then, forbear to muzzle,
And don't debar him of his bone!
Of hydrophobia take no fear:
Small risk of rabies yet this year!
What Dog-days, these, for garden-parties,
Display of 1- ashion's fine attire,
Wherein the mantua-maker's art is
A perfeot marvel to admire!
But waterproof were meeter wear,
In dripping Dog-days, for the Fair!
All heads hid under spread umbrellas,
See what a gay and festive scene
Those splendid girls and spruce young fellows
Present on gravel-path and green!
All shrouded in a macintosh,
While snails beneath your steps you squash.
For snails and slugs in showery weather
Come out amid the moist parterres,
And thrush and blackbird, both together,
Snap those molluscs up unawares;
And ever, as they gulp them, sing
Grace after grub which Dog-days bring.

Stop your laughter, friends!—a minute. Bow the reverential head
O'er the bier that bears the body of a Veteran that's dead.
There's no cause for lamentation, let no sorrow stain the page
Of a man who fought his battle to a patriarchal age:
All the giants he outlived them, they departed one by one,
But the epilogue—he spoke it ere his comedy was done.
One by one they left their leader, bred to work and born to rule,
Left him weeping o'er the ruins of his old Adelphi School—
Left him weeping for the glories of the old Haymarket time.
When the Men were in their triumph, and the Women in their prime.
They will greet with acclamation, as he nears the distant shore,
Suoh a fine old English Actor. "Rare Ben Webster " is no more!
Open gates of recollection to the long-remembered years
When his Graves excited laughter and his Triplet moved to tears!
He had humour, he had sparkle, there was cynicism's bite
When he soothed and he soft-sawdered as the oily Hypocrite.
Nature sohool'd him for an Actor, and " one touch " of it he show'd
When the oopyist Pennholder led to sympathy the road;
For the old man olasped his daughter with a ory upon his breast—
Then a pause, and then a silence—it was Nature told the rest.
Change the scene to Melodrama, realistic in its day,
Who forgets his Robert Landry in the old Adelphi play?
Who forgets his oft successes, Wbight and Bedford by his side.
Now in drama charged with pathos, now as reckless Richard Pride.
Change again to subtle humour, and, though comedy be rare,
There it lived in Joey Ladle in the new No Thoroughfare.
Ere the grass grows green above him, ere we ring the curtain down,
Let one throb of recollection stir the pulses of the town 1
He outlived his generation, did this venerable Sage,
Smiled at " coat-and-trouser " pieces and a milk-and-water Age.
Who can wonder that an Actor and a leader turned his back
On a decorated Drama and an Art of bric-d-brac t
But a greater revolution cheered the man who played his part
Midst the charitable curses that the people hurled at Art:
He had borne the brunt of battle, and he lived to see the morn
When the Actress was respected and the Aotor free from scorn 1
Hush your clamour for a moment, let your controversy cease!
A familiar voice is silent!—" Rare Ben Webster" is at peace!
NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER.
Well, if ever I was literally dumflounderd in all my life, it was
on last Munday arternoon at the House of Commons! I got one of
the dorekeepers to let me go in the Gallery, afore the dinners began,
to hear the Ouse acoep with gratitood and arty thanks, the haltera-
tion as the Lords had kindly made in the owdacious Shadwell Fish
Market Bill, so as to purteck the sacred rites of the Copperashun.
But what did I hear? The most awful accounts of pore old dear
Billinsgate. just because it's a little scrowged, and a little dirty,
and a little small. Even Sir William Arcoubt denouncing the
Copperashun's dry Monopolee, and acshally lartin at their sacred
Charter, and laying down the hawfully wicked principle that a
Charter as doesn't do no good ain't of no use! However, he didn't
have it all quite his own way, the Copperashun was boldly, tho'
wainly, supported by a Brightonian, and a Alderman, and a Irishman,
but even such a Treeo as that wasn't of no use, and the Lords'
improvements was both struk out amid the jeers and larfter of the
thortless Ouse. And then arfter this nokkin these ere 2 amemments
on the Ead, the Lords, on Fish-Fryday as ever wos, makes no stand
but alows 'em to be drownded like a kupple o' kittuns in the riwur.
Well—if I wos a Lord—but that aint neether ear nor there.
Wensday being a slack day with us, I took a walk down Thames
Street just to see what peeple are making such a fuss about in
regard to the Traffick. 1 had just a little drop of somethink to
drink with a ole frend of mine who's a porter in Buttolf Lane, and
he told me all about it. He says they has sum rare fun sumetimes
of a morning when the scrowge is at its best. He says he may run
against anybody, when he's carryin a load, if he only calls out Buy
Leaf, and one of their old jokes is that anybody as goes into Billins-

gate Market with a decent coat on is sure to come out all in Scale
Armer! Well, snm things as my friend Bill told me is snch stag-
ferers, as I 've a werry grate diflerculty in swallering 'em, but as
don't see what he has to get by lying, 1 'm forced to b'leeve him.
He Bays Wans of Fish from the Railways offen has to go past the
Market, and round to Tower 111 and back 3 or 4 times afore they can
find room to unload, and sumtimes they has to go back with their
Fish to the Railway Stashun, and bring it back again the next day,
which of course all adds to the jolly sorowge as they ginerally has
there, and don't much improve the Fish.
Well, that's pretty strong for a poor Waiter with only a modrate
Swaller, but jest think of this. His Master in Buttolf Lane had to
go to Dover last week. Wen he started, a Wan was at the door load-
ing. He went to Dover, transacted his bizziness at Dover, and
came back to Buttolf Lane, and the Wan was still in Buttolf Lane,
and remaned there another hour before it could get out!
I 'm werry sensertive to riddycule—most littery peeple is, I fancy—
so, wishing Bill good-bye, I sorntered into Buttolf Lane and had a
good look at it. I then went back 3 hours afterwards, and there
was lots of the same Wans as I had seen 3 hours afore, and getting
into a friendly chat with one of the Carmen, he told me they wes
offen 6 and 7 hours a-getting through this not werry long lane that
hasn't no turning. A most civil Beedle at the Cole Exchange, the
place I spose where they mixes the Coles, who I saw at the side door,
nex to a werry respecktable Pub, told me that sumtimes of a morn-
ing all the pavement is so covered with large wet fish-boxes, that
the Cole exchanging Gents can't get into their offices, and if he
wentures a slite remonsterence with the perspiring Kostermongers,
the powerful langwidge as they uses to him quite shocks the pore
Beedle's nerves. He says that sumtimes, when there's a jolly good
lot of Fish euros, the whole plaice is blocked for hours, and then the
Salesmen telecrams to the Fish Sender, "Market Glutted. Don't
send no more 1" But as I didn't choose to be insulted by being ex-
pected to beleeve such rubbish as that, I thanked the nervous Coley
Beedle and came away, pretendin as I didn't b'leeve a word of it,
tho' I do appen to know as it's all Trew! I wish we could send a
Telaoram to Ireland—" House glutted with Irish talk. Don't send

Blow's Soothing Surrup is to Mothers, and then we shouldn't want

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED TROJC
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Monday," July 10. — Hear
of a little arrangement now in
progress. Some of our young
men have had enough of
Gladstone, Harttn&ton, and
others who have enjoyed office
for many years. Their turn
now. Country hasn't got on
so well under these elders as
to put out of Court motive for
substitution of Juniors.
"They have tried it in the
Army," young Lambton says,
gloomily. "When a man's
been a Colonel for five years
he goes whether he's good o.
bad. "What's sauce for th
Colonel should be sauce for the
Premier. If he won't do as
we tell him, let him go. We '11

sprig of nobility, not without
satisfaction, glances at himself
in the Peer-glass.

delight of Joseph Gillis,
who, since Mr. Healt is
virtuous, thought there were
to be no more cakes and ale,—
browbeats the Premier. This
thing likely to grow. Peter

Youth has had enough of Age

to take the tiller itself.
Business done. —Arrears Bill.
Autumn Session announced.
Tuesday Night. — News from
Alexandria. Arabi the blest is
now Arabi the bombarded. A
flow of excitement through the
House, though not muoh shouting.
Everyone admires the way in
which the affair was carried out
from the first. No blustering;
no shouting in St. James's Hall.
No rattling of tumblers containing
Patriotic Gin - and - water, or
Brandy cold in! ■ Music - halls.
Arabi quietly told from the first
that he would not be allowed to
do as he liked in Egypt. Pre-
parations simultaneously made
tor bringing him to order if he
persisted. Thought we were fun-
ning, finds we are firing.
Only Sir Wilfrid Lawson not
happy.
'There is," he said just now,
"a party in the House not satis-
fied." But then Wilfrid wants
so mmch. If we were all teeto-
tallers, all members of the Peace
Society, and all privates in the Salvation Army, he would be sure
to find some other unpleasantness to force uj>on us.

Bright. John has come out
a regular fire-eater. At eight
o'clock this evening, whilst
sitting'suspended, was passing
through the Library. Came
upon trim in one of the quiet
alcoves. Had his coat off, snirt-
sleeves turned up, and was
sparring away at a dummy
figurejnade up of his coat on
the baok of a chair, and a red
silk handkerchief roughly re-
presenting a fez.
"What s the matter, John,"
I asked.
"I 'm having a round with
Arabi," J. B. answered,
dancing round the dummy,
and making fearsome feints.
"Ha! would your'" and to
quote classical writing, "he
fetched him one on the conk."

puffing, for he's getting a little
fleshy for this kind of exercise;
'' but that was four years ago.
and a great deal has happened
since then." Have since heard
that John was thinking of
applying for the post of Mili-
tary Governor of Alexandria,
when he suddenly changed his
mind, preferring the Society
of Friends to the Society
of Enemies. Yet "Bright
Pasha" would have looked
well in a fez.
Business dune.—Arrears Bill

Wednesday Afternoon.—Wilfrid Lawson shaking the Cap and
jingling the Bells over bombarded Alexandra. Gobble* found the
opportunity for him. Innocent ingenuous man, Gourley. Has been
to sea on a yacht, and has, to the hitch of the trousers, all the sim-
plicity of the British seaman. The wily Wilfrid having his jokes
ready must needs get them off.
"Didn't like to move the adjournment himself as that would'spoil
impromptu appearance. So got hold of Gourlet, as the monkey got
hold of the cat to pull the chestnuts out of the tire for him."
This is Onslow s version. Not sure that Onslow is an impartial
witness against Wilfrid. Certainly it was curious to notice that
when in this quite unexpected manner Wilfrid rose to second the
motion for adjournment, he was providentially supplied with notes
of all his jokes. Went off famously. Conservatives cheered tremen-
dously. Gladstone a little unpleasantly scathing, and Gourley
complaining that he had had rather an uncomfortable time of it,
whilst Wilfrid had thoroughly enjoyed himself. "But," as Sir
Charles Forster said, when he at last found his hat and observed
that someone had been sitting on it, "there's no pleasure in life
without its alloy."
Business done.—Arrears Bill.
Thursday Night.—Coolness sprung up between Bight Hon. friends
on Opposition Bench. Stafford Northcote complains that Hicks-
Beach, Smith, and Gibson hustled him when he was about to ask
the Government why they had not done something else at Alexandria.
Besides Hicks-Beach in jumping up and trying to get before Smith
trod on his toe. Hicks-Beach very sorry, but says Smith shoved
him. Smith quite unconscious of having done so, but if so it was
Gibson. He was at the Table first. Gibson had been up three times
with his joke, well enough once, about the convicts, and had tried
to elbow him (W. H. S.) off. Then, he admits, he laid his hand on
Gibson's arm. If in the struggle he cannoned against Hicks-Beach
very sorry. "That's all very well," Stafford Northcote says with
quiet persistency; "b»t the fact remains, my toe was trodden on."
In the end, determined to turn on Gibson. What's he to Egypt,
or Egypt to him, that he should jostle W. H. Smith at the table,
and cannon against Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, who trod on the toe I

SAUCE FOR THE GANDER; OE, SOMETHING LIKE A POLICE
REPORT.
Savage and Unprovoked Assauxt.—Sir Wilfrid Lawson, M.P., was
charged, on a warrant, with having, in an attempt to defend his house from
the attack of several burglars, inflicted grievous bodily harm on one or more
of them. There was also a second count charging him further with having,
when about to be struck on the head with a bludgeon, raised his hand menacingly
to protect himself. Mr. Richard prosecuted on hehalf of the Peace Sooiety. The
prisoner1, who had his head bandaged up in several places, and presented a very
pitiable appearance in the dock, was undefended. The evidence went to show
that the house of the prisoner, having been several times robbed by night, and
Bome of his servants quite recently murdered, under circumstances of aggravated
brutality, in his front garden, he was under the impression that he might take
some steps to protect himself and his establishment from further outrage.
Notioing on the particular occasion in question, several masked and armed,
figures creeping about, in the dusk, under his study window, with a dark
lantern, he had suddenly, and without any warning, hit one of them over the
head with a walking-stick. He was, however, overpowered after a short
struggle, and given in charge. Mr. Richard said he was instructed to press
for a conviction, as the Society he represented considered this a very bad case.
The Magistrate, addressing the prisoner, said he felt deeply the position—
the position of dishonour—in which he was placed. He regarded any pre-
cautionary act of self-defence such as he had resorted to, as cowardly, cruel,
and criminal. The liberties of cutthroats and burglars must, he was aware,
be respected. Moreover, it was perfectly lamentable to see a representative
character like the prisoner in the aook, who had proved himself, in the House of
Commons, Buoh a genial, hearty, and vigorous champion of all the worst
scoundrelism in Europe, suddenly turning round on every principle he had
professed, and adopting a policy which is abhorrent to every instinct of justice
and right, merely because he had reason to believe he ran a risk of being
murdered in his hed. Though he implored him to reconsider his ways, and,
in future, to act with common sense, common justice, and common humanity,
he felt, nevertheless, bound to make an example of him. He should commit him
for trial. The prisoner, who was understood to say that when he got out he
would let somebody " have it hot," was then removed from the Court, struggling,
and firing off an occasional witticism at the Bench.
Mrs. Ramsbothav tells us that a young friend of hers, who is an Under-
BTadual at Oxford, has had some difficulty with the authorities, and has been
fumigated for a year!

THE MLDSHIPMAID.

the sky is blue;
I 've nothing in

But watch the sea-

From 'neath the

And as I muse

shade,

Are closely plait-
ed, pig - tail -

A smart cocked hat, a trim cockade,
Are sported by this Midshipmaid.
I wonder, in a dreamy way,
If e'er she lived in Nelson's day?
Was she a kind of " William Cabb,"
Or did she fight at Trafalgar P
And could she wield a cutlass-blade,
This laughing little Midshipmaid?
Was she among the trusty lads—
Before the time of iron-clads—
Those reckless, brave young Hearts of Oak,
Who looked on danger as a joke?
Or did she ever feel afraid,
This dainty little Midshipmaid?
She might have fought, indeed she should,
In time of Howe or Colltn«>wood;
She might have—but I pause and note
She wears a kilted petticoat;
And 'neath it you may see displayed
Trim ankles of the Midshipmaid!

Is naught but pretty Cousin Nell!

You 're quite enchanted with my dress.

NO SUCH LUCK.
The business of Covent Garden Market, Bays Th«
Citizen, on the authority of Mr. Bourne, the Mudfordy-
Agent-Young-Man, is not to be transferred to Farringdon
Market. Of course it isn't. The idea of any such
scheme of relief having ever been entertained for a
moment, except as a good joke, by a Mudford official!
There are so many objections to such a beneficial plan to
be Bourne in mind. Perhaps one of these days, when
the long-suffering, much-forgiving, and very oblivious
Public shall have insisted on a policy of Government
intervention with regard to Mud-Salad Market nuisance
and Ducal barrier obstruction, the Agent, if refusing to
recommend reform, may live to exclaim, "I wish I had
never been Bourne!"
Cause on Effect.—Mr. Tin Pot O'Connoe, M.P.,
has been writing for the Newcastle Daily Chronicle a
series of artioles on "The Decadence of Parliament."
There is certainly no one better qualified to explain it;
unless, indeed, it were Mr. Callan.

And splinter huge stone-blocks like wood,
But a gunboat '11 see all the fun of the fight,
If the grit of its Captain be good.
Avast! nor don't think me a duffer so soft
'As to timber to wish to go back,
For there still is a Providence sits up aloft
To keep watoh for the life of poor Jack.
Your penny-a-liners palaver away
About Hearts of Oak, Nelson, and such,
Were that gallant old hero still with us to-day,
He 'd like pounding the Marabout muoh.
To hear our huge TemSraire thundering out
Would 'a quickened his pulses, / know,
Whilst that trim little Condor a-Bcudding about
Would 'a gladdened the heart o' Benbow.
Though an iron ton doesn't fly slow or hit soft,
That won't take our tars all aback;
There is still that sweet Chernb as sits up aloft
To keep watch o'er the life of poor Jack.
I said to our Poll, as was going to cry,
When an Eighty-One-Tonner she see,
"What argufies funking or piping your eye?
Why what a great goose you must be!
Can't you see the world changes, ships, guns, shots, and all f
But our Sailors aren't changed, don't you know,
And if to Old Davy I must go, dear Poll,
What matters, my dear, how I go?
Cheer up! All's a hazard. Come, don't be a soft,
like enough I shall laughing come back.
For there's still that there Cherub sits smiling aloft,
To keep watch for the life of poor Jack."
D'ye mind me, a Sailor should be every inch
All as one as a part of his ship;
Be it iron or wood, he won't offer to flinch
Whilst the sea holds a foeman to whip.
As for me, on the whopping Invincible"s deck,
Or the cocky hoop Condor's, I 'm game
For a slap at the foe. Arter all, I expect,
As it comes pooty much to the same.
Behind iron or wood, while their hearts don't grow soft,
British tars won't be taken aback,
And that sweet little Cherub still sits up aloft
To keep watch for the life of poor Jack.
Cetewayo's Residence.
The Government, amongst its other troubles, is puzzled to deoide
upon a fit and proper dwelling for the Zulu King. Lord Gingebxy,
who is always oautious, has suggested a suburban residence, probably
at Camden Town. If a hint from us is acceptable, we might name
Blackwall or Blackheath. Windsor Castle is out of the question.
After the Black King has moved he cannot oastle.
Mas. Ramsbotham tells us she recently purchased at a sale
in the country a Sheridan sofa and half a dozen Colebrook Dale
chairs, which give quite an Ascetic appearance to her drawing-

A HANDBOOK OF KNOWLEDGE.
No. VI.—The British 'Bus.
2. Chiefly concerning its Exterior.
Q. What means of communication are there between an Inside
Passenger and the Conductor of an Omnibus P
A. None.
Q. How then do yon make known to him your desire to alight?
A. This is always a difficult and sometimes an impossible task.
Vocal efforts are seldom of any avail, because 'Busses are noisy, and
Conductors much given to perching themselves on their top steps for
conversational convenience to themselves. Should you be seated
near the door you can put your head out and shout, or pull the Con-
ductor's coat-tail, or prod his legs—if you can reach them—with
your umbrella or walking-stick. Should you be seated at the other
end of the 'Bus, you are entirely dependent upon the grudging and
resentful aid of your fellow-travellers. The spectacle of an ancient
female firmly wedged in at the farther end of the 'Bus, urgently
appealing to a double row of sullen old City Gentlemen who view her
very presence as an intrusion, and being helplessly borne far beyond
her desired haven, is a fine subject for a Mephistopheles of the
mahl-stick.
Q. When you have arrested the Conductor's attention is all well?
A. No. There remain first the difficulties of forcing your way
to the door through the closely wedged knees and obstructive um-
brellas and other impedimenta of your fellow-fares, with nothing in
particular but their elbows and hats to hold on to, and, secondly,
".he perils of descent.
Q. What are these latter?
A. They arise from the following facts :—
1. 'Bus men will not stop if they can help it, and will shout
alarmingly at you whenever they possibly; can.
2. Omnibus steps are awkwardly steep, and, in bad weather,
dangerously slippery.
3. There is nothing available to hold on to but the rough, and
not always ready, hand of the Conductor.
4. Omnibus Drivers are fond of pulling up in the middle of
crowded and dirty thoroughfares.
5. Omnibus horses are imperfectly under the control of
Drivers, and greatly given to sudden starts and unexpected
bolts.
From which facts it will at onoe be seen that the descent from a
'Bus in Cheapside demands about as much care, strength, and agility
as the ascent of a precipice in Chamonnix.
Q. What external accommodation—if you will pass the word—
does an Omnibus afford?
A. You have a choice of seats on the Box, or what is known as the
"Knifeboard."
Q. Which do you consider preferable?
A. They are probably quite on an equality—in discomfort and
difficulty of access.
Q. How do you reach a Box-seat P
A. By clambering up in front of the fore-wheel, by the aid of its
box or its spokes, one or two fortuitously-placed slippery and Bharp-
edged footholds, something between quoits and door-scrapers, and a
leathern strap extended to you—if he can find it—by the Driver.
The man who can make this ascent—much more this descent—
without losing his balance and his hat, barking his shins, or
tumbling into the roadway, is qualified for membership of the
Alpine Club.
Q. When mounted, how are you placed?
A. You are crowded up, on a slanting seat close under the high-
perched and much-swathed Driver, from whose shiny cape in wet
weather the rain trickles into your ear or down your neck. Or, if
you have the outside seat, you find yourself suspended precariously,
your legs dangling in mid-air over the wheels, nearly shaken out of
your seat at every osoillation, with nothing between you and de-
struction but a small rail and a little leather strap.
Q. And as regards the alternative of the Knifeboard?
A. Of this it may be said that though hardly less difficult to reach,
or more comfortable when attained, it is not quite so perilous to
portly and unagile passengers as the Box-seat. It nevertheless fur-
nishes unsurpassed facilities for the enjoyment of cramped limbs
and the indulgence in rheumatic colds, through the agency of ill-
constructed seats and soaked cushions.
Q. What have you to say concerning the speed of this ingenious
vehicular contrivance?
A. That its pace is emphatically "the pace that kills"—either
your comfort or your patience.
Q. Explain this?
A. A 'Bus has two paces. One is the snail's pace, which is its
normal rate of progression at least during the nine hours of the day,
and whose plodding paralytic crawl compares unfavourably with
that of a rustic wain. The second is the plunging, rocking, sharp
corner-turning, flesh-bruising, bone-bumping pace of a runaway
horse, which it puts on when behind time, or racing with a rival
'Bus.
Q. Are all 'Busses suoh as you describe P
A. No. There are some comparatively comfortable and steady-
paced exceptions, sufficient at least to shadow forth the many and
easy possibilities of improvement which an interested confederated
proprietary neglects to attempt, and a too-patient non-co-operative
public neglects to insist on.

No. III.—The Fox and the Grapes.
Of fruit, whate'er its size and shape,
There's none so pleasant as the grape.

In meadows green from fold to fold,
In orchards rich from tree to tree;
A happy fox, indeed, was he!
Of lamb he'd eaten quite enough,
Of plums and apples quantum suff.
And now a taste for sweeter things
Our Reynard to the hothouse brings.
In massivo clusters hung the fruit,
The fox was ready for a loot.
"But stop," he cried, "on thinking
twice,
These grapes are neither ripe nor nice.
A fox like me with lots of brains
Will spare himself internal pains;
And I will not incur one pang
Through acid grapes; there let them hang!"
Moral.
When grapes are green and hard as stone
The wise man leaves such fruit alone.
A Chance for English Capitalists.—A new Egyptian Loan
will soon be started to repair the forts just destroyed by the English
Fleet. The money will be found without difficulty. The former
forts were built and knocked down with English capital; and it is
quite right that they should be rebuilt by the same financial agency.
SOLDIERING AT SARUM.
No part in the Wimbledon Encampment appears to have been
taken by the Salvation Army, from which a detachment might have
been told off expressly to compete with the Inns of Court Volunteers,
and engage in a sham fight with "The Devil's Own."
Instead of that, the companies of the Salvation Army, campaigning
about the country, have been almost everywhere encountering and
having real fights with the populace, conflicts recorded in journals
under the stereotyped heading of " Salvation Army Riots."
In particular, Salvation Army Riots are reported from Salisbury
to have, one evening last week, far exceeded in violence previous
disturbances in that city, where " a crowd of over a thousand persons
surrounded the 'Army,' and assailed them with rotten eggs, bags of
Hour, and other offensive missiles, whilst occasionally sqmba were
discharged among them." It does not appear that they returned
fire. Of course they could only reply to squibs with traots.
A coincidence may be seen in the circumstanoe that, about the time
when Akaiii's forts were under bombardment by the British Fleet
off Alexandria, the Salvation Army, at Salisbury, was getting pelted
with offensive missiles, and, in particular, shelled, so to speak, with
stale eggs. This, however, as an Army of Confessors, they perhaps
accepted as an ovation. Are such processions and psalmody to be
put down—which expression we prefer to "set down" as the
modern " Use of Sarum."
Avenue Theatre and 'Ave-another-nbw Theatre. — The
S. E. Railway, after passing through both Houses, must also pass
through this one,—a consequence of being on the Embankment and
so near St. Stephen's. If the present Bill, with the Manteaux Noiri,
has been successful, it is nothing to what the very effective S. E.
Railway Bill will be, as the latter will literally "bring down the

CRICKET HITS.

Drawing the Stumps.
A SALE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTUKY.
{By our Prophetic Reporter.)
The long-expected sale of the Duke of Smith's Collection came off
on Saturday last, at the King Street Auction Rooms. The apart-
ments were crowded with the ilite of the fashionable, artistic, and
aesthetic worlds, from the hour of opening until the moment of closing,
and. the bids were given and received amidst the utmost enthusiasm.
The first lot to attract serious attention was a Windsor kitchen-
chair, of the Queen Viotoria period. The Auctioneer pointed out
that, as this piece of furniture had the lower rail, so much admired
by connoisseurs, it was to be regretted that one of the legs should be
missing. The chair was put up at a £1000, and ultimately knocked
down at £4550.
A second chair, a copy of the last, but without the lower rail, went
for £25. It was in very perfeot condition, having its full comple-
ment of legs, &o.
Following the chairs oame a magnificent specimen of the flat
oandlestiok, in lacquered tin. As only six of these splendid objets
de vertu are known to be in existenoe, the biddings were of the most
spirited character. The candlestick was put up at £500, and, in an
ineredibly short time, was run up to £15,000. After this sum had
been reached, the biddings languished, and the lot was ultimately
knocked, down to Sir Everton Toffy at £21,000. At the South
Kensington Museum Bankruptcy Sale, in 1898, this candlestick
realised only £78 15*.
The celebrated kitchen-pokers of the Duke of Smith were then
put up, and realised sums varying from five guineas to a hundred
pounds. Much surprise and regret was expressed that his Grace
should have consented to the dispersion of a Collection which has
been regarded, for more than a century, as perfeotly unique.
The pokers were followed by the Smith Cabinet of Nineteenth
Century Fish-bones. The appearance of this lot was received with
thunders of applause: and, as the little red-coloured cardboard
receptacles were handed round, a murmur of admiration accom-
panied them. The Marquis of Bromptom and Islington (whose
eccentricities are so well known] made the first bid of £10,000, which
was greeted with shouts of " Shame!" and roars of laughter. The
oabinet was ultimately bought, by Jones Pasha, for £500,000, for
His Highness the Khedive of Jersey.
And now came the gem of the collection, the Brompton hat-and-
umbrella-stand, which is as perfect to-day as it was when it was
turned out of the Furniture Studios in Tottenham Court Road. The
tin tray, upon which the sticks used to rest their ferules, was found
to be in perfect condition. Under these circumstances it is not sur-
prising that the lot should have realised just half a million of money.
After the hat-and-umbrella-stand had disappeared, the interest in
the sale gradually declined, until, when the last lot was submitted
to the publio, there were scarcely a couple of thousand- persons to
bid for it. The gross amount booked by the Auctioneer, during the
proceedings, was £25,047,689. From this it will be seen that the
prices have scarcely been as high as rumour had anticipated.
A STEP FURTHER.
A Meeting of Ladies and Gentlemen interested in the foundation
of the proposed New University for the Manufacture of National
Poets,—an Institution in conneotion, we believe, with the School-of-
Dramatic-Artichokes,—was held yesterday, after the business of the
day was disposed of, at the Bow Street Pohoe-Court.
The Sitting Magistrate, presided, and was supported by the
Duke of Northumberland, Messrs. Bertram and Roberts, the
Lodge-Keeper at Hyde Park Corner, General Booth, and other dis-
tinguished and influential members of the Committee.
The Manager of the Lambeth Gas Company said he felt proud to
find himself connected with the scheme they had in hand. People
might ask, what connecting link he could point out between the cul-
tivation of poetic genius and the supervision of a gas-meter. He
could only reply, that in organising their Aoting Committee they
had endeavoured to follow as closely as possible on the lines laid
down for their guidance by a still older, if not wiser, Institution.
("Hear.'") He alluded to the School of Dramatic Art. {Loud
laughter.) And on this principle they had succeeded admirably.
He thought, as a regular public puzzler, their "list of influential
names" very nearly rivalled that of their dramatic friends at the
Mansion House. {Cheers.) There was scarcely one of them that
was really competent to pass any proper judgment on the matter at
all. {Roan of laughter.)
The Chairman said the scheme before them was simple enough.
It was felt by a large class of the community that, owing to the want
of any properly-organised system of education, the dearth of modern
Poets was fast becoming a national disgrace. [" Hear.'") They
proposed, therefore, by the establishment of a University supplying
a proper curriculum, to create them. (Cheers.) It had been said
by someone, " Poeta nascitur nonftt." That, thanks to their friend
the School of Dramatic Art, was an exploded fallaoy. {Cheers.)
You could make a Poet, as you could make a Pastry-oook,—as you
could make an Actor. {Roars of laughter.) And this is what they
were about to do. {Cheers.)
Mr. Alfred Austin said, speaking from a long and exhaustive
professional experience of the subject, he had at last come to the
conclusion, that if a man were not born a Poet nothing on earth
could ever make him one. {Loud laughter.)
The Chairman of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Paoket Com-
Eany said he had assisted, with his advioe, not only the School of
iramatio Art, but also a kindred Institution destined for the special
education of Lord Chancellors, and, therefore, he felt he could put
forward a programme for his colleagues with much confidence.
There would be four terms. In the first, the students would study
the Rhyming Dictionary under a competent professor._ {Cheers?)
They would also be instructed in the kindred arts of hair-dressing,
playing the lyre, mountain climbing (this with a view to Parnassus],
and posing their elbows on mantelpieces in good society. In the
second term the course of instruction would be the same as in the
first, except that the professor would be allowed to escape to the
sea-side and have his medical and travelling expenses defrayed
out of the University chest. {"Hear."') In the third term the
students would be called upon to write a poem. And in the fourth
—and this was the great point—they would be expected to find a
publisher. {Loud clieers.)
A Dramatic Author of eminence, whose name, however, could not
be distinctly heard, asked whether such an influx of genius into
the market might not be a mistake. {"Hear!") He had been a Poet
of the first order, himself, for the last five-and-twenty years, but he
held under his arm, at that moment, a Five-Act Tragedy in blank
verse, to which he could get nobody to listen. He proposed to read
it to the meeting. (Uproar.) What then did they propose to do with
their Poets, when they got them? Where would be their opportunity?
The Chairman said that difficulty had already been foreseen and
surmounted. It had been calculated that when the Dramatic School
had got into full swing, there would probably be a very large per-
centage indeed of young and aspiring Actors capable of anything,
but quite unable to find any parts whatever in which to display
their abilities. An admirable Institution suoh as they proposed to
establish, would be the very thing to supply this deficiency. The
two establishments would, in fact, be worked together. The Manu-
factured Poets would be able to provide permanent and prolific work
for the Manufactured Actors. {Loud and prolonged cheering.)
After a few desultory remarks from the Lord Mayor, who said he
had dropped in to see how they were getting on, as he liked to
have a hand in any pie that might keep his name well before the
public and give him a little extra popularity, Mr. Hamilton Aide,
who had, as representative of the entire dramatic profession,
listened to the various speeches with very marked attention, moved
the adjournment of the discussion, and the proceedings terminated.

TAKEN IN TOW.*
Oh, Pangbourne is pleasant in sweet Summer-time,
And Streatley and Goring are worthy of rhyme:
The sunshine is hot and the breezes are still,
The River runs swift under Basildon Hill!
Since I have the luck to be taken in tow!
Though battered am I, like the old TSmeraire,
My tow-ers are young and my tow-ers are fair:
The one is Eleven, the other Nineteen,
The merriest maidens that ever were seen.
They pull with a will and they keep the line tight,
Dimpled Dolly in blue and sweet Hetty in white;
And though you may think it is not comme ilfaut,
'lis awfully nice to be taken in tow.
I loll on the cushions, I smoke and I dream,
And list to the musical song of the stream;
The boat gurgles on by the rushes and weeds,
And, crushing the lilies, scroops over the reeds.
The sky is so blue and the water so dear,
I 'm almost too idle to think or to steer!
Let scullers delight in hot toiling, but 0 !—
Let me have the chance to be taken in tow t

The leaves rustle low and the stream runneth strong:

Oh, cruel Electricity, that gives so strong a light,
In many an unprotected lamp you flashed supremely bright,
You shone upon our pretty gowns, illuminated flowers,
But all too ruthlessly lit up these pallid cheekB of ours.
'Twas at the Horticultural, and ferns and flowers were there,
The beautiful gloxinias, and orchids passing rare;
They faced the incandescent lamps as erst they faced the sun,
While many a cheek grew strange of hue and felt itself undone.
And vainly Art aids Nature now in unobtrusive way,
This lamp malign of Edison's is worse than brightest day;
A veil may serve to soreen from sun, but when in evening dress,
There's nothing 'twixt these awful lamps and female loveliness.
Then, Men of Science, you must aid and tell us, if you please,
How we shall make our charms withstand such glaring lights as these;
For ifjthe Ladies find these lamps still turn them pale aDd wan,

THE BENEFIT OF THE ACT.
The Lessee, Manager, and Leading Actor—in faot, the "Boss" of the Lyceum, has already
announced to the public that he intends to take a Benefit. 'Why? Every performance at his
own theatre is for his benefit. If a season has been a very bad one, and a Manager appeals
to the Public to assist him in his pecuniary difficulty, such a case might be considered one of
real distress, and an appeal ad mitericordiam would, no doubt, meet with a sufficiently
hearty response from the charitable theatre-goers, out of admiration of the man as an Aotor,
and ont of pity for him as an unfortunate speculator who had done all in his power to
deserve success. Of course we would do our best to "get up a Benefit" for a "Poor
Player" whose ill-health prevented him from earning his livelihood by the exercise of his
profession: but Actors in the position of the Lessee of the Lyceum would not care to appeal
to the Public on the ground of being very " poor players "—in any sense. Last year, through
the liberality of the Public, we were enabled to assist the poor London school-children to
several Days in the Country. If the London Manager-Actor wants his little holiday, he can
take it, and oan turn his " Day in the Country" to pretty good account, as there will be
scarcely a single provincial town which, besides paying him handsomely for his performances,
will not also give nira a "bumper at parting," by way of a Benefit. This was all very well in the
time of the Crummies family, when receipts
were precarious, and the unfortunate
strollers depended on their "bespeaks."
But the status of the professional Aotor has
advanced since then, and going round with
the hat should be beneath the dignity of
our leading Actors and Actresses.
Our " Lazy Minstrel" writes to say that
he should very muoh like to take a Benefit,
and of course our other Contributors will
follow suit. Why doesn't Sir Frederick
Leiohton or Mr. Millais take a Benefit P
Mr. Bancroft, as Lessee and Manager,
is, we believe, an honourable exception to
the Benefit system, and we trust, in the
social interests of the Profession, other
leading Actors and Managers will follow his
example.
IDYLS OF AN OPTIMIST;
Or, Carols in Couleur-de-Bose.
II.—A Noble Savage.
Warble not in soft iambics
Of the simple Cherokee,
Dally not in dithyrambics
With the flesh-pots of Fiji.
All that Patagonian prank meant,
Every game by Carib play'd;
Blttdson, of the Thames Embankment,
Wholly puts into the shade.
Bludson might inspire a Cooper,
Bludson might impress a Pope;
He's as stalwart as a trooper,
Could with sturdiest Navvy cope,
In his unsophisticated
Simple savagery he '11 lurk
For the wayfarer belated,
And that wanderer brain or burke.
He will slily steal behind him,
Like Red-Indian on the trail,
Ha will bash, and braise, and blind him,
Kicks will shower, thumps will hail,
Tomahawking, knifing, clubbing,
Blttdson's humour does not suit;
He delivers mortal drubbing,
With the buckle or the boot.
Weapons he, the wild predacious
Pleasing product of the Town,
Finds extremely efficacious,
Constable—or wife—to " down."
For this rude, robust, Rob-Roy-ish
Calm contemner of the law,
Finds a pleasure frankly boyish
In belabouring his squaw.
Instincts shy and yet gregarious
Move this modern Choctaw's soul,
Whether on a iaunt burglarious,
Or a homicidal stroll.
For the artifice of " ganging"
Greatly simplifies the job
Of bestowing a safe banging
On the man he 'd maul or rob.
Nor are Lambeth's banks inferior,
In facilities for Blttdson,
To the shores of Lake Superior
Or the valley of the Hudson.
Wild in wood the noble savage
Ran,—or so the singers say;
Viixpson too can run, and ravage,
Quite as wild in Tiger Bay.
Let us then be glad and gleesome
That the "noble savage" sort
Civilisation's ruthless besom
Hath not swept from slum and court:
That to murder, mrim and rob, is
- Recreation safe for all;
Whilst we 'vc'Bludson and such Bobbies,
Why should modern times sing small?
Dog-dats! pooh! Dogs-and-fats-days,
if Rain is to count for anything.

Monday Night, July 17.—Getting so used to Ministerial resigna-
tions that the Bright affair went off rather flatly. At first, thought
there was going to he no speech at all. When time came, Mr.
Bright, sitting in old corner-seat helow the Gangway, made no sign.
Like the operative in indigent circumstances, occasionally alluded
to in speeches and newspaper articles, he had no story to tell.
Quite surprised to think House should require explanation.
"Just like Bright," Harcocrt says. "Whatever he does is right.
No room for questioning. Nothing to explain, and nothing to defend."
Also quite delightful his placid assumption of being right, and the
Cabinet wrong, on a point where they chance to differ. Speeoh like
Forster's in this respect, only, happily, shorter.
Good grind at Arrears Bill. Going through Clauses now hand
over hand. At midnight Dr. Lyons rose with prodigious speech and
elaborate scheme for raising the money to pay off Arrears without
costing anybody a farthing. Sort of "How-to-live-on-sixpenoe-a-
day-and-save-eightpence " speeoh. House first amazed, then indig-
nant; but Dr. Lyons, in intervals of attending patients, had thought
the matter out. Besides, speeoh probably in print in Dublin, and
must be delivered. Members below the Gangway howled. Members
opposite roared. Dr. Lyons accustomed to this sort of thing. A
patient in a dentist's chair having his tooth pulled out, does not like
it; but operation designed for his good, and must be gone through.
House catches him up at every point. "In these trying circum-
stances "says the Doctor. "Yah! yah! yah!" roars the Com-
mittee. "As the painful operation goes on "he innocently
remarks; and loud cheering gives the observation quite a new point.
Lyon Playfair scores one. Some one rises, and asks whether
this long harangue is in order.
"I understand," says the Chairman, "that the Hon. Member
proposes to show that the funds might come from other sources than
the Church Temporalities?"
"Exactly I " says Dr. Lyons, grateful for this acknowledgment of
his purpose.
"Then," says Lyon Playfair, "I shall be glad when the Hon.
Member approaches that part of his speech."
A little rough this, after the Doctor's been operating for half-an-
hour. Business done.—Arrears Bill.
Tuesday Night.—Wonder why when Conservatives were in power
they didn't make Sir John Hay First Lord or at least Seoretary to
the Admiralty. Sir John not only a gallant sailor, but a stirring
orator, and a perfect whale at all-night sitting. Boasts that he never
left the quarter-deck through all the storm that resulted in suspen-
sion of Irish Members and the passage of the Crime Bill. To-day
has been up delivering stirring Alexandrines on the misconduct of
Government in Egypt.
"If we only had Hay there!" Mr. Wakton murmurs, "or if
he 'd been in Childers' place, how different it would have been."
Grand old man Sir John looked, shaking reefs out of his coat-tails
with his left hand, whilst waving his right as if it held cutlass
and he was boarding the Treasury Bench. Vociferous cheering
from the party of boarders behind, including Alderman Fowler,
who wanted to sing a stave of "Rule Britannia." Sir James Hogg
thought Speaker would object, so Alderman contented himself with
a chorus of "Yah! yah! yah!"
Wilfrid Lawson had his joke with the House about the bombard-
ment. Now, House has joke with Sir Wilfrid. Was to have oome
on to-night with Local Option Motion. Been severely engaged for
several days preparing impromptu jokes and repartees. Had the old
ones out on the beach, as it were, overhauling them, caulking and
tarring where necessary. Tremendous excitement amongst Temper-
ance Societies. Extra rations of ginger-beer served out. Came
down at Nine o'Clock prepared for pleasant evening. Licensed
Victuallers here, too, in great force. No difficulty in distinguishing
the two parties as they stand in the Hall waiting admittance.
Deep conspiracy against Wilfrid. Bowled out. Proposal that
he should make speech in Octagon Hall. Wilfrid won't. Says
some of the jokes will do for public meetings, others stand over for
next Session. In rather low spirits himself. Only thing that cheers
him is cessation of firing in Alexandria.
"Now the two Quakers are out of the Cabinet, we '11 have no more
towns bombarded," he says.
Business done.—Arrears Bill in Committee.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Good deal of excitement this afternoon
of one kind or another. Nobody here just when wanted to move
their Amendments. Enter a few minutes after; quite surprised to
find opportunity gone. Mr. Warion says it's all a plot of Chairman
of Committees.
"All arranged beforehand," he says, stoking himself afresh with
snuff. "I saw Lyon Playfair look round to see if GHEGORYand
Rathbonb were in their places. Not there, so off he goes to lunoh.
Always away twelve minutes, at least. To-day, came back in nine
minutes. Found Committee empty, and so rattled through Bill.
His dodging of Gregory really disgraceful. Met him in the Lobby,
just as he was coming back. Gregory going towards the House,
and would be in time to move his Amendment. Lyon Playfair
whispered in his ear that a remarkable infant had been deposited on
the steps of Westminster Hall. Gregory, Treasurer of Foundling
Institution first, Member of Parliament afterwards. Went off to
investigate contents of the basket. When he came back, found his
Amendment passed over in his absence. It's my opinion the Chair-
man of Committees is equal to anything."
After Arrears Bill, Mr. Stansfeld on with his unsavoury measure.
Mr. Speaker's advice to Women about to enter the Gallery: Don't!
But they did, a round dozen of them. Terribly angry that the
speeches were so short, and that Mr. O'Shaughnkssy, in particular,
spoke so low that they could not hear a word he said.
Business done.—Arrears Bill through Committee.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
Thursday Night.—Mr. Gladstone gives notice of a Vote of
Credit. House risesas one man and sings, " We don'twant to fight."
But Peteb will have none of it. Neither will Henry Richard nor
Sir Wilfrid Lawson. Talk of forming a deputation to go out to
Egypt to see Arabi, and try and induce him to be good enough to go
away. Consult Sir George Elliot on the point. Sir Georoe gently
rubs his waistcoat and thoughtfully pats himself in the region of the
pockets. Doesn't think much of it. Besides, he says, they '11 find
Egypt very hot now. Wilfrid Lawson says he doesn't care. Has
got a white hat. Elliot warns them that it is indispensable when
approaching an Eastern Chief to take with them presents. Arranged
that Henry Richard shall take with him a copy of The Trans-
actions of the Peace Society. Peter will approach Arabi with a
handsomely-bound copy of his "Speeches on Foreign Policy deli-
vered in Parliament," and Sir Wilfrid will take a case of Zoedone.
Business done.—Report on Arrears Bill.
Friday Night.—Some consternation at midnight on sudden ap-
pearanoe of Sir Stafford Nobthcote in a pair of black tights.
Came in quietly behind the Speaker's chair, and by tucking legs
under seat, escaped attention some time. But division on; discovery
inevitable. Worst of all was voting in " No " lobby. Sir Stafford
had to go down towards the door in full view of Ladies' Gallery.
Pat it oft till last moment, which made it all the worse. Better have
walked out with the crowd. Pretty to see Sir Stafford skirting
the benches, and hungering after shadow of the Gallery. But if
these frivolous young men will go to balls at Marlborough House,
they must take the consequences.
Business done.—Arrears Bill finished.
MONUMENT TO MR. PEPYS.
[Excerpt from the Diary of S. P.'s Shade.)
(Samuel Pepys.—An influential committee has been formed for the
purpose of obtaining subscriptions towards the erection of an appropriate
memorial to Samusl Pepys in the Church of St. Olave'i, Hart Street.)
Elytium, July 25th.—To the Philosophical Happy Thought
Society, where i aba day, since he have come here, hath set up a
spiritual magnetic machine, he invented to
convey, besides the matter of books from the
Earth hither, the contents of all the news-
papers, by means whereof I did over a
tankard of nectar, read the news, in which
a passage taking me by surprise pleased me
mightily, and gave me more delight than any
I think I ever had in all my life, even since
I have lived here. It brought tidings, under
heading of my name in capital letters, that
what they call an influential committee hath
been formed for the purpose, as they do word
it, of obtaining subscriptions towards the
erection of an appropriate memorial to me,
Samuel Pepys, in the Church of St. Olave's,
Hart Street. And then come the members of
the Committee, at the head of whom the
Master of Magdalene, my own College, Cam-
bridge, and then the President of the Royal
Society, the Deputy Master of the Trinity
House, the Secretary to the Admiralty my
present successor, and the Master of the
Clothworkers' Company. They propose me
the honour of a monument in St. Olave's Church, I hope nigh the
Chancel where I myself placed one in memory of my wife, for all I
did now and then write her down a fool at times when she made me
laugh, or troubled me. And so now I am going to have a statue.
Lord, to think in what remembrance I am at the end of nigh two
hundred years, and how celebrated and famous I have become, and
what a figure I do cut in the Bight of Posterity! At least I suppose
my memorial is to be a statue, and I had rather that than a tablet,
or any other monument, and do hope not to be put off with a slab in
the wall. That is, provided my statue be a likeness, and there be
now in England or the world any statuary of sufficient skill to make
it; for most of the London statues I hear said to be such figures,
that, if mine were so unhandsome and so ridiculous as they are
reported, it would make me ashamed.
If I had only foreseen I should one day have a statue, I would
have taken order to preserve the mould I did once have made of my
face, which any fit statuary might fashion a correct resemblance
from; and, for the rest of the head that no mould was taken of,
it will not much matter, if I am exeouted in my periwigg, to the life,
as I desire. But there is a picture of me, I am told, at South Ken-
sington which would suffice the modeller to copy, and if he do 1
would have him represent me holding the scroll of musique I com-
posed to "Beauty, retire," painted true. Also to take all possible

pains to make my dress out in all particulars as right as possible,
especially my stockings, which I was always mighty proud of, and
I would fain they should be the linning stockings whioh once on a
time I made myself as fine as I could in, together with the wide
canons that I bought one day at the Hague. I would likewise, if
able, bid him robe my image in the Indian gowne I hired to be
drawn in when I sat to Hales.
Home to my bower in Asphodel Meadow, where my wife, with
Enipp she had bidden to supper, playing and singing duetts together
like two sisters, whioh was pretty. They both mightily rejoiced to
hear of the honour I am to have. Question of who were best to do
my monument, if to be a statue; and I would choose the President
of the Royal Academy, if he chisel as well as he do paint, but my
wife say rather the Artist who do model the Waxworks at Madame

THE SPENDTHRIFTS GUIDE.—No. HI.
After a little rest from his theatrical extravagance, the Spend-
thrift should prooure an "organ." There are organs of various
kinds. There is the tenor voice which Providence, for some myste-
rious reason, bestows on one man in fifty years, and there is the
musical instrument on wheels, which, because it delights and refines
the multitude, is called a nuisance. The organ I mean is called a
Newspaper. It may not be a newspaper, but it is called a newspaper.
The Spendthrift can always buy an organ, because organs are always
in the market, but he will be exposed to competition, because pur-
chasers of organs are in the market likewise. No matter how feeble
or unsuccessful a newspaper may be, it can always command a few
hundreds for its copyright; and the Spendthrift has only to increase
these hundreds to thousands to obtain what he wants without the
slightest opposition.
Having purchased his organ, his first task will be to engage his
Editor. Editors are very fond of having organs of their own, and
of treating proprietors with the utmost contempt. The Spendthrift
must be prepared for this, and must only be too delighted to find
unlimited capital for the publication of other people's crotchets. # The
Contributors will be chosen by the Editor, and will own no allegiance
to the Spendthrift-Proprietor. He will be allowed to visit his own
premises occasionally, and will be supplied with an early copy of his
own paper free of charge. If he wishes to insert a paragraph in
any number, he will ask the Editor's permission, and must not be
astonished if he is refused on the ground that he is endangering the
policy of an established journal. He will do well to accept his
position, and cultivate a belief in the infallibility of bis Editor and
Contributors. His Editor, in exchange for capital, will provide him
with cut-and-dried opinions on every possible subject. He will not
only be told what happened yesterday, but what is going to happen
to-morrow. He will act, where it is possible to act, on this cocksure
information. He will read his own Money Article " with trusting
faith, and instruct his broker to buy or sell everything according to
its directions. He will back all the horses named as winners by the
Sporting Contributor, and buy all the pictures praised by the Fine-
Art Critic. By the time his Editor has become a Member of Parlia-
ment for an important borough, or been selected by Government for
a well-paid Commissionership, the Spendthrift Will probably have
grown a little tired of owning an "organ."
Mbs. Ramsbotham would be pleased to learn whether the
"Hanging Gale " recently mentioned in Parliament is "the ill wind
that blows nobody good," and whether Mr. Bebesfobd Hope's
Nevel of Strictly Tied Up refers to the punishment of garotters P

"HE WAS SUCH A CONSISTENT MAN!"
{A Biographical Fragment not founded on Facts.)
The Ex-Chancellor of the Duohy of Lancaster retired, smiling, to
his home, feeling satisfied that he had performed his duty nobly. It
was somewhat late, or rather early, when he reached his own door,
as the House had been making a night of it. He was, consequently,
slightly surprised, not to say startled, when he discovered that the
portal had been burst open without the aid of a latch-key.
In the hall he found a couple of burglars removing a grand piano.
He was about to remonstrate with them in a forcible manner, when
the elder addressed him politely—
"Right Honourable Sir, I am one of your warmest admirers, and
I feel sure that you will not mar the story of a well-spent and con-
sistent life by the enunciation of principles repugnant at once to
your conscience and your inmost feelings]"
"But surely you do not wish to remove my furniture ?" mur-
mured Mr. Bright.
"You are entirely mistaken," replied the burglar who had already
spoken. "We have been at work lor several hours, and have doLeall
the reception apartments with the exception of the drawing-roims.
You would infinitely oblige us by assisting us to carry this heavy
musical instrument into the van.
The Ex-Chancellor hesitated. He was very fond of the grand
piano, and yet it seemed churlish to refuse the polite request.
_ " I should be sorry to appeal to anything but your reason," con-
tinued the burglar, carelessly playing with a revolver. "Still, it is
only right to tell you that we are entirely of the opinion that your
assistance is absolutely essential to our well-being."
"On my word I believe you are right!" said the Ex-Member of
the Cabinet, laughing and removing his coat; and from that moment
the Eight Hon. Gentleman worked as hard as either of them. It was
a merry party. When the fifth van had been filled and despatched
to its destination (the emporium of a well-known reoeiver of
stolen goods), a policeman looked in, and tendered his good
services.
"Don't forget the principles of your whole life," murmured both
the burglars, simultaneously.
"I will not," returned Mr. Bright, courteously. "Thanks, Con-
stable, but I do not see how I can avail myself of your kindness. I
presume you would attempt to get back my property by force?"
"Well, yes, Sir," replied the Constable. "We 've been wanting
these two gentlemen for a long time, and are glad to have caught
them. So just a couple of taps"
"By no means. Constable, I fear you do not understand the
moral law."
"I know nothing about that, Sir; but here I find a couple of men
robbing your house. Shall I take them into custody?"
"Certainly not. I am opposed to the use of any force. I believe
that the code of morals in full recognition as regards nations should
equally apply to individuals. So, as I see that these gentlemen have
just discovered and carried away my cash-box, I will bid you, one
and all, a very hearty farewell!"
And, bowing politely to the policeman and the burglars, the ex-
Cabinet Minister re-entered his large, but dismantled house, smiling,
contentedly.

"The point o' this here

[noting Captain Cuttle to

of it."
"Exactly so," replied J. B..
"I see where it lies perfeotly."
Then he commenced singing,
feelingly, " Good-bye, Sweet-
heart — Sweetheart, Good-
bye!" hut suddenly he broke
off in the verse to say, "A
needless Alexanrfn'an ends my
song"—and bo quitted the
apartment and the Cabinet.
"Good-bye, John!" sang
out Gladstone lustily, but
failing to recall the remainder
of this old ditty, he murmured
to himself, "tor which over-
haul Ethiopian Melodies, and
when found make a note of."
Then he sat down to medi-
tate. A peculiarly sharp
perky countenance made its
appearance at the door. It
was a morning for quotations,
and so the new-comer at once
chirped the old refrain—
"Of what ia the old man thinking,

"Ah! my Chambeblain I
You, is it? Alas! the Thanes

mier's sorrowful exclamation.
"So much the worse for the

berlain, and then added in a
voice tremulous with emotion,
"But—trust me—I never
will desert Mr. Micawber."

WAGGERY AT THE WAR OFFICE.
A Battery of Artillery having been already shipped by the
Authorities from Malta without any horses, while four hundred
Marines have arrived at Alexandria, without any rifles, the Orontes
troop-ship good-humouredly keeping up the fun, by coming on the
scene without any troops, it is quite dear that the Horse Guards
have determined to maintain their reputation as the best practical
jokers in Europe.
When it is reported that the Expedition, now starting ostensibly
iorEgypt, will be landed quite unexpectedly at Zanzibar, without
either its stores, transport service, ammunition, or boots, while Sir
Garnet Wolseley will be put out on the Scilly Islands by mistake
his cocked hats and instructions having been previously sent on to
Cyprus, it will be seen that the frolic in store for the delighted tax-
payer will be, as usual, fast and furious. Mr. Punch cannot help
asking, Who is the comio man at the baok of all this?" for he is
bound to admit that that Orontes idea was quite a master-stroke, and
promises wonderfully.'
Mora War Preparations !—Lieutenant Swagger Athome, of the
3rd Administrative Battalion Heme Bay Volunteer Engineer Corps,
has placed the services of the men under his command at the dis-
posal ot the Horse Guards in case of emergenoy. The Proprietors
01 the Kamsgate Bathing-Machines have been confidentially asked
how/ many of their horses they could render available for duty
abroad in the event of further cavalry reinforcements being des-
patched to Egypt. The Band of the Commissionnaires has been
reoruited to its full strength. As it is proposed to permanently
embody the Royal North-West-South Diddlesex Militia, the Police
Force in the neighbourhood of their Head-Quarters has been
hastily doubled. Captain Wellington Abbrcrombie Havexock
Jones, of the 4th Battalion Royal Canadian Irish Highlanders, has
sent in his resignation.
WHAT WILL THEY DO WITH USP

If I go to Egypt,
Shall I be able to stand more than three consecutive days of the

If he does, will he find his boots particularly comfortable P
Will he, at 110° in the shade, be allowed to wear towels on his
helmet, and go into action with a white umbrella?
If he does anything of the sort, will he be likely to wish himself
back at Enightsbridge P
I 've heard of Egyptian Fellahs, are there any Egyptian Nursery-
maids?
Shall I be voted useless, be beaten by an Egyptian neddy, and
finish up in an Oriental Circus P
If we are both carted off in this fashion to the East, will a Volun-
teer on a cab-horse look anything like us at the Horse-Guards?
Is there the remotest chanoe that, at the eleventh hour, the
Authorities may, for onoe, leave the right things in the right place,
and just let us alone P

Mr enemies, who disagreeable matters like to mention.
Insist that I have changed ray front—I really don't know why.
For when they say, "Now, Wiliiam, how about Non-intervention?
Those principles you boasted onoe?" I modestly reply
Chorus.
I 'm going to do without 'em—don't want 'em any more;
I 'm going to do without 'em, just as lots have done before.
I 'in going to be a statesman on an admirable plan,
Then all yon boys and girls will say, " Oh, what a Grand Old Man!"
'Twas thought at first I couldn't get along without supporters,
That when together Cowpeb, Laksdowit, Aroyix fell away—
Not omitting Bright and Forsteh—which brought things to closer
quarters,
I certainly should close the shop. And yet, what did I say P
[Spoken)—What indeed, except
Chorus.—I 'm going to do without 'em, &c., &c.
When, after very muoh mature and deep deliberation,
I wired at last to 8eymotjb, " You may let them have it hot,"
Being asked how he had saved the town from loot and conflagration
Without some troops to land, did I not answer on the spot ?—
[Spoken)—Well—I don't quite know, but
Chorus.—He had to do without 'em, &o., &o.
Still very oft necessity will prove the best adviser:
For here we 've struck a telling blow, then halted in our work.
So now, as I 'm inclined to think prompt action had been wiser,
If you should ask me what I mean to do about the Turk,
[Spoken)—I should, I think, rejoin
Chorus.—I 'm going to do without him, &c, &o.
Mistakes, of course, are human things. They '11 happen, and no
wonder.
For instance, great Departments even sometimes make a few:
The Orontes f And the Tamar, that brought out, by some strange
blunder,
Those Marines without their rifles! What had those Marines
to do?
[Spoken)— Well, speaking with all reservation, I should ?ay
Chorus—They had to do without 'em, &c, &o.
Since, with Egyptian rocks ahead, and Irish legislation,
1 grieve to say there's many a Bill must needs go to the wall;
For any use that's practical this Parliamentary nation
Might just as well possess no representatives at all!
[Spoken)—So, what about new measures?
Chorus—It '11 have to do without 'em, &c, &c.
But there, as August's drawing near, I must, with purpose sober,
Define the situation, though unpleasant it may be.
You '11 have to end your holidays the Fifteenth of October;
Oh yes, you will, my worthy friends,—you '11 have to do like me!
{Spoken)— And, pray, what am I going to do? Well
Chorus.
I 'm going to do without 'em,—although the thing's a bore;
I 'm going to do without 'em, just as lots have done before.
And, though you mayn't consider it an admirable plan,
Deep in your heart of hearts you'll say, "Oh, what a Grand Old
Man!"

A Drive to the Pavilion.
Holding a Catch.
A HANDBOOK OF KNOWLEDGE.
No. VII.—The Butcher.
Q. What is a Butcher P
A. The subtle tyrant of large households, and the scourge and
terror of small ones.
Q. I fear you mistake me. I am not referring to an autocratic or
a military "butcher"—in the sense in which Caligula or the Duke
of Cumberland could be so called—but to the affable, and commonly
adipose, person in blue who acts as retail purveyor of meat to the
community. Can your answer possibly apply to him?
A, Distinctly.
Q. But how is this terrible tyranny of a mere, and apparently
amiable, tradesman manifested?
A. By his compelling the community to purchase whatever
meats he may choose to supply at whatever prices he may please to
exact.
Q. How does he manage to do this?
A. His system comprises many subtle devices and ingenious con-
trivances. One of these is known as " calling for orders."
Q. Is not this a convenient and legitimate practice P
A. In itself, yes; the mischief lies in the way in which the Butcher
works it.
Q. But if you give your orders in a clear and definite way, will he
not, like another tradesman, carry them out, as a matter of course,
to the letter P
A. Not at all. The difference between the weight and price of a
leg of mutton—for example—as ordered and as delivered, will at
once serve to explode so amiable a theory.
Q. Have you not the remedy in your own hands of returning the
joint upon his P
A. Certainly. But it is easy to make this practically impossible
by delaying delivery until your choice will be between that parti-
cular mutton and no meat. Indeed, the Butcher's plan of operations
generally is based upon a profound study of human nature and
domestic exigences. He knows well that the ordinary British house-
holder will rather face the probability of future loss than the cer-
tainty of immediate inconvenience. He robs indeed, but rather like
an adroit usurer than an imperative highwayman.
Q. You say he robs P Is not this a serious charge to make against
a British tradesman?
A. It is. The Butcher himself would probably select another
word to describe his practice of wilful misunderstanding and
deliberate overcharge.
Q. Is no account rendered at the time of delivery P
A. Skewered on to the joint—if it have not been dislodged in
transit—may perhaps be found a greasy scrap of paper, bearing
some undecipherable scrawl, supjwsed to have reference to the
weight and price of the meat. As it is frequently lost on the road
by the butcher-boy, and always disregarded as unintelligible by the
cook or housekeeper, it affords no certain clue to cost, and presents no
insuperable barrier m the way of subsequent overcharge.
Q. But what if, by weighing the joint yourself, you deteot such
overcharge?
A. The Butcher then has an alternative of two perfectly safe
courses. If you cannot furnish proof, he will dispute your accuracy;
if you can, he will regret his own—or rather his shopman's—
"mistake." A discovered overcharge is always a " mistake." An
undiscovered "mistake" is always an overcharge. "That is the
humour of it."
(J. But Buppose you go to the shop to select a leg of mutton for
yourself?
A. The Butcher will probably demur to cutting a leg for yon, and
dissuade you from selecting any leg already cut, but will confiden-
tially counsel you to "leave it to him," as he will " have one up
presently that'11 just suit you." "Them legs," he will intimate,
slapping one of them derisively with his knife, " though well enough
for the common herd, will not do for you" whose superior taste he
can gauge to a nicety.
Q. Suppose that, resisting these blandishments, yon insist upon
selecting one before you, and on Bceing it weighed P
A. He will yield with mournful dignity, as sorrowing to see a
customer of hit so lose caste, and probably—it may be in mere com-
passion—send you home quite another joint.
Q. Even if you have paid on the spot for that particular one?
A. This he will not permit you to do if he can possibly help it.
"Oh; better let me book it, Sir—or Madam "—he will say, with a
lofty smile, subtly suggestive of the abject contemptibleness of the
contrary plan. And why not let me send my young man round
for your norders?" he will add, with a look as subtly expressive of
his sense of the " bad form" of the opposite practice.
Q. And suppose you resolutely decline to allow him either to
"call for orders" or to "book "?
A. Tho British Butcher cannot treat with common civility the
customer who so violates the interested etiquette of his trade. His
very soul revolts against personal calls and cash rmymente, as mean
devices, hampering the happy freedom of imposition, and limiting
the pleasant possibilities of " mistakes."
Q. Do you mean to imply that the Butcher is I was about to
say less honest, but will rather express it as "more ingenious " than
other tradesmen?
A. His trade, from its very nature, affords fewer facilities than
many others for that particular form of competition which harsh
moralists call " adulteration." His " ingenuity " is therefore taxed
to devise substitutes for that great standing resource of the British
Shopkeeper.
Q. With what results P
A. Such as it would take long indeed fully to describe. I have
already mentioned one or two of them. The task of keeping np the
price of meat, in spite of all causes which naturally would tend to
bring it down, is one which continually taxes, but which never
exhausts, the resources of this " ingenuity." The skiU with which
he will combine open depreciation of "inferior foreign stuff" with
the secret vending of it as, and at the price of, "prime English," is
admirable—from a certain point of view. In the "cutting up" of
joints, and the apportionment of bone, fat, and offal, with a view to
getting the " best price " for the same, he does greatly shine. He is
very adroit, also, in the management of the scraps and fragments
known as make-weights." A block of bone may be introduced
into a joint with whose normal anatomy it has nothing to do, and by
carefully-arranged accident one particular " scrag" may be weighed
and sold with half-a-dozen or more "best ends —by simply being
"left behind" when the joint is despatched to its destination.
Moreover, in Butchers' book-keeping the terms "posting" and
"double entry" may be made to bear meanings that would hardly
be recognised by a punctilious accountant. If the public were made
free of the little greenhouse-looking structures where, during the
slack hours of the day, greasy-locked youths or smart-ribboned
dames wile away the weary hours in transferring credit-entries from
one book to another, it might find that the—of course accidental—
discrepancies between the first and the second entries, though
dexterously "distributed over," tottled up to a tidy balance- not
exactly in favour of the customers.
Q. Are all Butchers equally—ingenious?
A. Probably not. Nature and Fortune do not so equally dis-
tribute their favours. There are simple, plain-dealing Butchers,
just as there doubtless are unsophisticated^ lawyers and guileless
Israelites.
Last week's Illustrated London News lias a portrait of "Lord
Charles Beresforb, in charge of the Police at Alexandria." What
has this gallant Officer done to be " in charge of the Police "? We
thought that he was looking after the Police, not the Police looking
after him.

If anybody as is jest a little tired of the bussell and the scrowging and the

thurro change, he hasn't far for to go for to find it, thanks agin to the grand
Old Copperashun, as is alluB a-doing sumthink or other for a ungreatfool Public.
And should any right honnerrabble members of the wenerable Ouse of Lords as
happens to live in the naybrood of White Chapel, and is over fatigued with the
hawfool amount of work as they has to do daily every night, pine for a change,
jest like a poor devil of a Radaical, he can alius get it in sumthink less than no
time. For instance, he can take the Tram and go for thrippence to Layton
Stone, and then go as Straight as Douglas till he comes to a Green Man's Pond,
and then on till he cums to the Manshun House of the last of the Alldermen,
Allderman Finis, and then go over the left and fust to yer right and there you
are, at the entrance to WonBted Park Plezzur Grounds. You 've no occashun to
nock at the dore, because it's only a Gate, but in you gos in yer own rite, like a
blooming Free Holder, and you walks rite on till you comes to the Temple, not
like the Temple in Fleet St coz there ain't no Lawyers, and not like the Temple
on the Oben Wireduck coz there ain't no Parker, but only a most quiet and
respectable Keeper of the name of Puff'em, so there is a sort of family likeness
in all three after all.
Having paid yer respecs to Mr. Puffem, you takes the parth to your rite
and you comes m about 10 minnits to what I feels inclined to call about the
thirteenth wundur of the World, reckning Happy Roastweal Gardens as about
the twelf, and that is the wundurfullest Grot Oh! in Yourrope! I saw at once
by his new unyform and his sollem demeaner that Mr. Puffem is a man of the
strictest werassity, or I Bhonld have been inclined to dout him wen he told me it
wa» all bilt by a Lady, and that it cost her jest fifty thousand pound! It
seems a lot of money, but if it is all bilt of preshus stones, as Mr. Puffem says,
we knows as dimonds and them sort of things does run into a lot. However be
that as it may, I quite agrees with a rayther exsited Koster Monger who said,
with rayther unnecessary wigger of langwidge, that with that Grot Oh! for his
orib and them perch ponds for his fish in, he shouldn't want any other pair-o'-
dioe. Ah I them's somethink like Fish Ponds them is, why, Mr. Puffem acshally
told me, with that sollem look_pf his, that Bumtimes of a evening the Fish is a-jump-
ing about, and a-splashing about to that extent, that you 'd think as there was a
lot of boys a-bathing there! And he looks at you so serious
that you carnt carp at his Fish stories. When he's
crammed you full of Fish, then he begins about Poachers.
Somethink like Poachers, too, them is. Why, the fUBt
thing as they poached drecly he was anointed, but before
he had his new Unyform, was all the led off the roof of
the Grot Oh! That wasn't bad for a beginning. Thenex
thing as they poached wasn't eggs, as I naterally thort
when he asked me to guess, but about 36 duzzen of
butiful white water lilies. And think of their hartfulness
in getting at 'em. As the lillies was in the middle of
the Lake, they strips theirselves to their skins for fear
of wetting theirselves, and then boldly plunges in up to
their nees in water, and higher than that, and carries
'em ashore, hoping to sell em at the Market price of
four shillings a duzzen. But a eye was a-watching on
'em as they couldn't see, tho' he had his new Unyform
on, and the Perlease siezed 'em in their unperteoted
condition, lit'rally catching 'em in the naked lac, when
of course they couldn't run away, and the awful wengence
of the Lor come down on 'em to the extent of twelve
shillings!
Well, I have in my long egsperiense seen about as
many butiful places as most Waiters. I 've seen old
Woxhall Gardens, and Wite Cundit House, and Ornsey
Wood, and Iberry Barn, but I haven't the least esitation
in giving the Parm Tree to Wonsted. Of course there's
a intire absense of those elewating amusements, such
as Swings and settrer, in which the nobel Brittish Publick
takes such grate delight, tho', judging from what has
been dun in Epping ForreBt in that line, we may hope in
a werry short time to have even them, but for those who
can manage to spend a few ours in the butiful pure
hair without 'em, there isn't a lovelier spot for rest and
quiet and peaceful injoyment, than Wonsted Tark.
And how strange to think, as Mr. Puffem told us,
that if these butiful grounds had not once blonged, about
a hundred years ago, to one of the greatest scamps in
Yourrope, who married the pore gal who owned 'em for
her money, and then broke her heart by his unkind-
ness and neglec, the Copperashun would never have been
abel to buy 'em for the use and enjoyment of the Public.
One thing as struck me harder p'raps than it would
strike nonperfeshunals, is the hutter habsence of wittles!
Brown says as how even the Copperashun wants a little
rest now and then for the Stummick's sake, and so on
them occasions they cums down here and inwardly digests
plenty of fresh hair, and then goes back to the place
from whence they came, like giants refreshed.
I 'm afraid Brown ain't got no reverence. In fac he
confesses as muoh, for I 've herd him say that " no Man's
a Nero either to his Wally or his Waiter." Robert

EGYPTIAN PREFERENCE!"
THE CHAMPIONS OF CHRISTENDOM.
"So they have left me to save her alone !" exclaimed Sir John of Merry England. "This,
after all the Frenchman's protestations and all the Italian's bluster. But what matters it P
Oladstonius, my armour!"
Upon this, the brave knight's Squire, after a great deal of fuss and confusion (for
Gladstonius was a procrastinating person), buckled on his master's sword and iron plates.
And when this had been done, Sir John hurried away to Alexandria, to rescue Egypt, the
Fairest of the Fair, from Arabi the Dragon.
When Arabi saw Sir John approaching, he indulged in the most ridiculous demonstra-
tions of impotent rage and feeble defiance.
"Very good!" said the Champion of Merry England. "I will teach you a lesson, my
fine fellow, that shall last you your life. This will I do, not only in my own interests, but
for the benefit of the brothers who have deserted me!"
And the brave knight drew his sword, poised his lanoe, and made ready to begin.
"Stay a moment, f beg you!" said a fat, sleek, fawning sort of person, whose apparel was
ai seedy as his appearance was unprepossessing. "You do things in such a very hurried manner."
"Who are you?" was the natural ques-
tion of Sir John.
"I am the Sultan Slyboots," replied
the fat, fawning creature, "and I am the
father of Egypt, the Fairest of the Fair."
"Then if you are her Father, you will
approve of my intentions? Stand aside,
while I resoue her."
"But let ub chat it over a little. Who-
ever saves Egypt, the Fairest of the Fair,
will have a right to claim her. Surely,
this seems just; do you not think so?"
"Let me save her first," said Sir John;
"and we can settle the details afterwards."
"But it is so much better to talk. I am
very angry indeed with Arabi; but——"
What has the Dragon dangling round
his neck ?" asked Sir John, sharply; "it
seems like a Turkish decoration."
"Oh, yes!" returned the Soltan Sly-
boots, with some confusion. "It is a little
toy I gave him to play with. But to return
to our talking"
"I did not oome here to talk," inter-
rupted Sir John. "but to fight!"
If you would just wait, while I"
"Why, you unnatural parent!" thun-
dered Sir John; "I do declare you are
making signs to the Dragon while we are
talking!"
"Surely, you are mistaken! My left
eye-lid frequently quivers unconsciously!"
But while Sultan Slyboots was explain-
ing how his eyelid had quivered, Sir John
poised his spear onae more, and went for
the Dragon. Arabi uttered a loud howl,
and showed the White Flag, which bore
a remarkable resemblance to the White
Feather.

10 p.m.—Put a white nightcap over my fez, make a waistcoat of
a pillow-case, and go out in my dressing-gown for picket-shooting.
Midnight.—Doze off, and dream I do 'em all at last by "a sur-

EGYPTIAN QUESTION IN THE TIME OF KING KRISIS THE STARTLER.

Moxday Night, July 24.—Lords discussing Vote of Credit.
Marquis of Salisbubt volunteers his "humble support" to the
Ministry. This looks bad. Gbanville moves uneasily in his seat,
and Kimbebley foresees some
attack upon the revenues of
the Duchy of Lancaster. Lord
Cranbboob: makes effective
speeoh. Elaborately leads up
to striking passage, wherein
he likens Sultan to Shylock,
and Gladstone to Antonio,
in the Scene where Antonio
borrows the three thousand
ducats.
"Fair Sir," Lord Cban-
buook declaims, "you spat
on me on Wednesday last,
you spurned me such a day;
another time," &c, &c.
Brought down the House.
"Capital 1" says one Lord to
another. "Cbanbbook im-
proving." "So very apropos.'"
Wish they 'd let us Mem-
bers of the other House
occasionally say a few words
here. Should like to have
got up and observed that
the illustration was exceedingly appropriate two or three weeks ago,
when Mr. Punch had a Cartoon on the subject, and parodied Shy-
lock's words. Mr. P. doesn't mind finding ideas for Noble Lords.
But just as well to observe the formality of acknowledging source of
inspiration.
Glad to find the line to be drawn somewhere with respect to
the Land-Leaguers bullying the House of Commons. Early in
the Bitting Messrs. O'Donnell and Healt sat upon the House
like a fearsome nightmare. House met to consider question of
Vote of Credit. Great crowd to hear Gladstone's speech. Cheerful
Eresence of Prince of Wales diffused over the Gallery. Hasn't
een here lately, finding the proceedings a little too exciting for a
man of quiet habits. Mr. Chaplin observing H. R.H. sitting aloft,
like a dignified cherub, let off little speech. Always glad to please
his Prince.
This nothing to entertainment provided by Messrs. O'Donnell
and Healt, the Bounding Brothers of the Westminster Circus.
O'Donnell accused Sfeakee of predicting what he was going to
say, and ruling it out of order. Healt vastly improved on this,
rolling over Gladstone, the Clerk at the Table, Lyulph Stanley,
and people generally. O'Donnell had made a palpable hit, and
Healy determined to outdo him. This, with a little assistance from
other Gentlemen from Ireland, delayed.business for a full hour, and
Lord Kimberley, the Kolonial, appears as
the Chancellor of the Dutchy, out of
compliment to the Boers.
presented a pleasing spectacle of Parliamentary manners to strangers
in the Gallery.
It was late when crisis arrived. Vote in Committee of Supply on
account of furniture for Public Offices in Great Britain. Healt
wanted to discuss the chairs and tables in Board of Works Offices in
Ireland. Chairman reminded him that Vote applied solely to Great
Britain.
"What!" ories Mr. Healt, "isn't Ireland in Great Britain?"
Moment of terrible suspense followed. If Lyon Playfaib. worn
out with work, and buffeted from all sides, had hesitated, all was
lost. But he was equal to tbe occasion. He firmly ruled that
Ireland was not in Great Britain; and Mr. Healt, fearful of fresh
suspension, subsided.
Joseph Gillis was at the moment asleep, or the episode might
have ended differently. Does not mean to pass it over. Willgive
notice to call attention to arbitrary conduct of Chairman of Ways
and Means in ruling Ireland out of Great Britain.
Business done.—Vote of Credit proposed.

Dbummond led Gobst up to

So had to put up with ordinary notes. Terrible anxiety lest they

Thursday Night.—Found Habcocbt to-night sitting quite limp
in the Library. His child-like smile vanished, and his complacency
collapsed.
"What's the matter, Vebnon?" I asked, taking out a pocket-
handkerchief, to be ready in ease of emergency. "Has somebody
been sending you another box, and won't the Police open it at a safe
distance'("
"It's not that, Tobt," said the great man, with a tear in his
voice. "It's the House of Lords. I'm afraid they'11 abolish it before
I reach the Woolsack. Hear they 've taken just four hours to debate

nine o'clock Ababi-Ashhbas-
Babtlett-Bby entered, with
bundles of notes and des-
patches. Conveniently spread them out on desk before him.
Went out and returned secretly, conveying glass of water in his
hat. Then sat and waited opportunity. But it never came; and
after sitting till eleven o'clock, folded his papers like the A kadi, put
the glass of water where Alderman Four j.kr would sit down when he
came in, and silently stole away. Of course the speech is not lost.
If he can't deliver it on the Vote of Credit, we shall have it on
the Indian Budget. But, in the meantime, the Empire may be
ruined.

from Alexandria:—
"The wildest stories imaginable are afloat, and, therefore, without founda-

At first sight the "therefore" appears a little odd, and a terrible
suspicion besets the mind that the hairbreadth 'scapes of this daunt-
less and gifted man have affected the lucidity of his style. But,
on further consideration, the case is quite clear. If a thing, whether
a storey or a whole house, is afloat, it is, of course, without foundation.
—Q.E. D.
FROM AR-MED J. B. TO AH-MED ARABI.
Sib, London, July 24, 1882.
Oub Profit, speaking from our Indian Commerce, commands us
not to seek war, nor to begin it. But this same Profit hath commanded
us that when war has once been oommenoed, it shall not cease until
the Credit Total of the Ledger is greater than the Debit.
Hence, the so-called " National Party " of Egvpt may rest assured
that the first gun fired from the forts of Alexandria has absolved the
British Book-keepers from all contracts and conventions. India is
held by Englishmen as the key to wealth and honour, and all are
bound by every law to preserve Doth the one and the other. Sermons
on this subject have Deen preaohed. in every British newspaper
throughout the (English-speaking) world, and an agreement in this
sense has been come to with the political leaders of all parties. Thus
it is unnecessary to repeat that the first blow struck at England by
"Horrible Pasha " sealed that gentleman's fate most effectually.
The British Race have not allowed themselves to be duped by the
ridiculous theories of Mr. Blunt—theories that have had to be
pricked at last—with brute force—with the point of the bayonet.
Egypt is, and always has been, anxious to he friendly with England.
She will protect England's interests now, as heretofore, in every
way. England, in return, will not underrate the mischievous inso-
lence of the military upstart who is now trying to burlesque Buona-
partk beneath the shadow of the Pyramids. Rebels in our modern
days make sudden and gigantic bounds in the path of malignant
tomfoolery.
"Horrible Pasha" in fine may rest assured that he will be either
shot or hanged. In either case his let will not be a happy one.
This communication is in reply to a letter sent by you to "the
Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone, M.P." I prefer to answer it myself:
for this reason—I am already his master, and soon will be yours.

of sly significance. The third time, seeing the Lion starting upon

familiar conversation with him.
And this was the conversation—not given in the earlier versions of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MODERN LIFE IN LONDON; OR, "TOM AND JERRY" BACK AGAIN.
ft *i&

THE TRIO WITNESS THE NATIONAL GAME.
"The athlete, my dear Coz," said Corinthian Tom, one morning
after breakfast, "is one of the 'facts of the age,' and I am glad
therefore that Young Bob proposes to devote a couple of days to
exploring the ramifications of the National Game of Cricket.
We are to go one day to the Orleans Club, and on another to
Lord's, and I have no doubt that this new chapter of Life ih
London will well repay perusal." "I am ' all there,' " said Jerry.
Thus then when Young Bob appeared, he found our heroes " all
agog " for the Orleans Club, and Master Logic very soon " tooled"
them down to Twickenham behind four spanking " bits of blood " in
admirable style. On arriving at the Club-House just below
"Twickenham Ferry," and once the abode of the Princes of Orleans,
they found that the game had commenced. It was a pleasant sight,
the house with the noble trees round it, the drags and the repre-
sentatives of Church and State who were there to say nothing of the
softer sex. Responsive cheers rang out as a stout party came
"charging" after the ball in the direction of the Trio, which
caused the Corinthian to remark that he would not like to indulge
in such violent exercise when Sol's rays were so ardent. Neither
Corinthian Tom or Jerry Hawthorn had been much given to
Cricket in the old days, but still there was no fear that our friends
would be stumped, or bowled out; while no one would suspect that
either the Corinthian or his Coz would be long off the game of
Life, or fail to make runs until they were brought up by the long-
stop. Thus they were much interested in the game, but still more
in the characters assembled. For, the jailed "man about town"
came there thinking that a glimpse of the country and a peep at
"Father Thames," with a bit of dinner in a cool room, would put
him right; and many a modest maiden and frisky matron gathered
there also, finding much more diversion in Flirtation than in Cricket.
Ton and Jerry were so delighted with their experience of the
Orleans Club, where they dined sumptuously after the match, that
they eagerly reminded Young Bob that he was to conduct them the
next day to Lord's to witness another contest with the willow. So
the morrow saw them on their way to St. John's Wood, and the
famous ground of The Marylebone Cricket Club. It was, in good
truth, an exhilarating scene, and made The Wine of Life beat faster in
their veins as they lounged into Lord's. There were the swells and
the snobs, the Costers and the Charmers, the loafers and the ladies,
the ducks and the dandies in "lavish profusion. What was " not a
little curious," too, was that, although a great match was going on,
nobody appeared to care a rap for the Cricket. There were scores of
"drags, upon which sate bevies of beauteous damsels, intent upon
lobsters and Champagne: and, so far as the athletic concert was con-
cerned, the Elevens might just as well have been standing on their
heads, as playing the national game. What did it matter to the festive
Fair Ones whether Studd or Grace won the day, whether Oxford
triumphed over Cambridge, or Eton licked Harrow? All these
charming critics cared for, was the "cold collation," and the casual
cavalier; they had come to eat and drink on the apex of a " drag,"
in the open air, and, so far as the players were concerned, they might
as well have been engaged in jF¥res or Football, or "Grinning
through a Horse-Collar." In fact, a Public Schools or Universities'
Match, in these days, has resolved itself into a species of Saturnalia,
which may fairly be said to have no connection with Cricket.
Unless you are like our Trio, among the " knowing ones," and the
goes of the Metropolis, who have their carriages there with their
attendant flunkies to "minister to the needs " of the inner man and
woman, you will see nothing but the backs of the Crowd, and wander
like the Peri of Mr. Moore, a musical, but rather loose-fish of a
poet, outside the Paradisaic enolosure. True, if you are fortunate
enough to be a member of the " M.C.C.;" or, Marylebone Cricket
Club, you are "free" of the Pavilion, whence many a veteran
criticises the colts of the day, and "bangs down " his blunt upon the
"side " that he fancies in a popular match. Here were many old
games fought " o'er again," and the heroes of other days sighed over
the gout that prevented them " taking a bat" with the youngsters,
or bowling "maiden overs" that would non plus any of the famous
Graces.
_" It is a fine game," said the Corinthian; "and though I could
dispense with all this aristocratic guzzling, which turns the place
into something very like a Country Fair, and leaves the beauteous
grass a chaos of lobster-shells, crumbs, paper, and straw, still it
affords to the Philosopher a glimpse of Life in London. Indeed,
you have not done the gay Metropolis nowadays unless you have
'looked in' at the Orleans, and ' assisted' at Lord's; and it is as
necessary to be au fait with the names of the Warriors of the
Wicket as with the appellations of famous Statesmen, or Race
Horses, or Popular Beauties." "Right you are!" said Young
Bob; and as to Beauties, there are plenty of 'Professional
Beauties' here, I can tell you." The Corinthian and Jerrt
laughed at this Sally, but hardly took Young Bob until
he kindly explained that there was a race of Females nowadays
calling themselves "ladies," who advertised their charms in every
possible way, who were noticed in Society Papers and photographed
to such an extent that any proletarian who possessed the necessary
bob could buy their likenesses, and gloat over them for that ridicu-
lously small sum. "We did not live in a moral age, my dear Coz,"
cried the Corinthian on hearing this, "but 1 m hanged if our
mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters would not as soon nave 'cut
off their right hands as allowed themselves to be paraded in the
Shop-Windows in this disgraceful fashion!" And Corinthian Tom
was right. He was no prude, he had " seen life " in all its various
colours from Almack's in the West to All-Max in the East; and
no considerations of propriety prevented him from "having his
fling." But to use the slang term of the period, he knew where to
draw the line, and the fast and flashy females who allowed them-
selves to be photographed for the edification of the " Vulgar Herd,"
made him remark somewhat sarcastically to his Coz, that the feminine
manners of the day seemed to have altered "considerably for the
worse." Young Bob, it must be said, did not agree with Corin-
thian Tom, but said he "thought it doosed good fun, don't you
know, to have photos of all these poppets, and that it' got them on'
in Society." "That may be," saia the Corinthian, bowing to Youn»
Logic, for Tom was the pink of politeness, "but all I can say is, my
dear Bob, 'So muoh the worse for Society.'"

THE METROPOLITAN BOARD OF FAITH.
As Parliament is drawing to a close, the fussy Members who have
taken up the Firet in Theatres subject are anxious to know what the
Metropolitan Board of Works have done in the supposed interest of
playgoers. Sir M. Gabbulous Hogg reported that, out of four
hundred Music Halls and fifty Theatres, they had surveyed eleven
Theatres and four Musio Halls, but did not add that six months had
been exhausted in this Herculean labour. Some of the requisitions
in these fifteen cases have been opposed and referred to arbitration,
so that the playgoer will have to wait many years before his favourite
haunts of amusement are brought into harmony with the ideas of
Bumbledom. Though many questions have been asked and answered
by the Chairman of the Board of Works, no one has asked what the
Board has done, or proposes to do with the Musio Hall which owns it

expect me for a week. However, promised to
find me something to do.
9 a.m.—Handed, over to the Drill Instructor.
Formed into a hollow square—(very hollow—

to do both politely.
Thanks, mon bon Wilpbid; I hope to be on your Committee, next
week.
Great Improvements !—The Proposed New Theatre is in every
way admirably adapted, so we are'informed by its eminent Architect,
Mr. Fibbs, for instantaneous exit. There is only one entrance to
the Stalls, so that no one can possibly lose his way, or take a wrong
passage. There is one Btaircase for everybody, and the passages on
either side of the Dress Circle admit of at least one person at a time
to pass easily. This, in case of panio, is invaluable, as it insures
individuals walking out in single file, and so restores confidence.
All the passages from Pit, Stalls, Dress Circle, and Boxes meet in
one common and convenient outlet, bo that everyone, whether he has
paid a guinea or two-and-sixpence, has an equal chance of safety.
The Gallery alone has a staircase to itself, but this was unavoidable.
There is admirable accommodation for smokers; and at least ten
refreshment bars. The roof, being a sliding one, can be taken off at
a moment's notice. In short, there is no danger to be apprehended
from the construction of such a theatre as this.
The Adjutant's Hobs Again!
This appears in the Somerset County Gazette:—
WANTED, a good CHARGER, by a MouDted Infantry Officer. Must
canter like a rocking-horse, and be warranted to stand fire. Apply to
&c, &c , The Barracks, &c.
It seems a pity that our Adjutant is not satisfied with his last
mount. But, perhaps, as "the Charger" must "be warranted to
stand fire," our gallant and high-spirited friend has some intention
of volunteering for Egypt P
WALKER!
Mb. Boucicauxt, in his descriptive dramatic lecture, the other
day, is said to have referred to " Walking" as " a lost art;" and to
have illustrated his assumption, by taking up his hat, and showing
his audience how an Actor ought to walk oft the stage. No doubt
there is something in the charge; but the real regret should lie
deeper. "Walking off " the stage may be a lost Art, but to judge
from the crowd of raw and inexperienoed young gentlemen and
ladies who now handicap the success of every pieoe in which they
are concerned, evidently " walking on " to it is nothing of the kind.
If, in fact, walking on to the stage were only half as difficult a
business as walking off, there would yet be a chance for the British
Drama.
AN IBREGULAR POSER.
The Madrid Cabinet have, through their Foreign Minister, in-
formed the European Powers that " Spain feels called upon, in the
face of the present aspect of affairs in Egypt, to assume an attitude."
She cannot refrain from having a finger in the settlement of the
freat water-way to the East:—this is no doubt due to her old here-
itary penchant for liquidation in any shape that presents itself.
There is, of course, no objection to a great Compounding Power like
Spain assuming an attitude if it pleases her; but as, financially,
she has for some time past contented herself with a modest pose " on
all fours," her foreign creditors can only hail with satisfaction any
promised change of posture. If her new attitude could only find
her on her legs, she would have the thanks of every one-per-cent.

WHAT NEXTP
Among the varied and ever-increasing attractions at the Alhambra,
the spirited management has at length announced, apparently,
nothing less than nightly " Confirmations." If this is the case, and
proves to be some clever move of the Church and Stage Guild, it will
be interesting to know the name of the enterprising Bishop whose
services Mr. Wiiliam Hollani> has managed to secure. Anyhow,
the idea sounds excellent, and appears to be capable of infinite
expansion. Baptism, marriage, vaccination, decease, bankruptcy—
anything in short requiring a " certificate," might be worked into
the bills of most of the leading West-End Houses with advantage
and point; for, in these days of personal announcement, no vulgarity
is deemed to be too excessive to be out of place in a theatrical adver-
tisement. Taking a striotly ecclesiastical view of the matter,
"Orders" would seem to be the only other downright institution of
a kindred stamp hitherto utilised in this line with sucoess. However,
"Confirmation1' is a step further on, and we shall watch the move-
ment with marked interest.

A LITTLE NEDDY AND A BIG "G»;
OR, THE SOLOMON-GRUNDI OPERA.
Ma. Sidney Grundy's motto evidently is, "If you want a thing
well done, don't do it yourself." He acts accordingly, and the Vicar
of Bray is the consequence.
Mr. Gbundy felt called upon
to write a Comio Opera; he
ransacked his imagination
without finding anything
which made the search re-
munerative; and bo, not
being a man to be put down
by such trifles as absence of
original ideas concerning
incident or character, he
turned to see what he could
borrow from his predecessors.
The result is a "new and
original" Comic Opera with
about as much claim to new-
ness and originality as the
shadow of the moon, reflected
in a perturbed and weedy duck-pond, would have title to be regarded
as a new and original planet.
Mr. Gbundy's Vicar bears a strong family resemblance to an eocle-
siastic who did duty for Mr. Gilbert in The Sorcerer. That
Vicar suffered from the attentions of a mature female, and so,
oddly enough, does Mr. Gbundy's Vicar. And is Mr. Gbundy quite
sure that in making Sandford a highly moral Curate, and Merton a
festive countryman, he is strictly on new and original ground?
Does memory deceive us? Do our eyes play us false when we enter
a bookseller's shop or pass a railway book-stall? or is there a Comic
History of Sandford and Merton, from which these characters, with
ten or twelve years added to tbem, are plagiarised? Then, again,
the Solicitor, Mr. Bedford Howe, is he not an old acquaintance?
The Huntsmen—are they not the dragoons in Patience, and is not

-.■-'.
the very same stage-business, when the girls enter, preserved? As
for the Chorus of Sohoolmasters, let justice be done to Mr. Sydney
Gbundy. He has not borrowed them from Mr. Gilbebt. No one
can accuse him of that; for they are borrowed from Lecocq's Let
Prfo St. Gervais, an adaptation of which was once given at the
Criterion Theatre. These things being so. what becomes of the
newness and originality of The Vicar of Bray t At all events,
there is very little evidence in it of the vigour of brains.
Theologians, who are familiar with the Thirty-Nine Artioles, who
have a knowledge of Tracts for the Times, and. possess an intimate
acquaintance with Essays and Beviews, may detect the humour
of the Vicar's changes of opinions and mutations from High Church
to Low, and from Low to Broad; but if the Author is abstruse here,
he makes up for it by sending out Mb Curate Sandford as a Mis-
sionary. Will anyone be surprised to hear that what is tendered as
a quaint conceit in this new and original Comio Opera, is the
reported destruction of Sandford by cannibals, who draw the line at
the Missionary's hymn-hook, after devouring him? Mr. Gbundy
may indeed claim his heroine as his own. Dorothy has this novel
trait about her, that, whereas heroines almost invariably have some
distinguishing feature, she has none.
The playing of the piece is in no way remarkable. Mr. Hnx is an
exponent of what may be called the subdued horse-collar style of
humour. There is no assumption of character in his performance of
the Vicar. Mr. Hill plays Mr. Hill as usual; but, fortunately for
the player, there are those who find his manner comic. Mr. Penlby
has more point, and with it he extracts such good things as his
Author has provided. The heroine, on the other hand, speaks her
lines so badly, that, at first, the credulous hearer is led to suppose
that this is the joke of the piece, and that the Chorus of Schoolmasters
are going to take the young lady in hand; for a few lessons in pro-
nunciation and emphasis would obviously be of servioe. Mr. Solomon's
new and original music to the Opera includes some rather taking
tunes that have been admired for many years past; fromwhio'i it
will be understood that they are not quite so new and original as
they were formerly; but this is the way with tunes, sometimes,
—specially with " taking " tunes—and with libretti likewise.

"THE STONE OF DESTINY."
Dear Mk. Punch,—Everybody knows that the Scotch are a wonderful people, although,
according to Sydney Smith, there is one quality in which they are notoriously, and hopelessly
deficient. According to that eminent authority, they are utterly, except under certain
circumstances, which he explains, impervious to a joke. But the dictum of Sydney Smith, I
presume, applies only to jokes proper, or jokes improper, but not, I am satisfied, to practical
jokes; for I have just made the important discovery that, for centuries past, the Scots have
been playing upon us poor Southrons a practical joke of the most stupendous kind.
"Every schoolboy knows that our great King Edward, after belabouring the Soots
for twenty years, brought nothing away from their blessed country except a stone, and a
precious ugly stone too, but upon which they pretended that their kings had been invariably
crowned, from the days of Noah downwards; and we poor deluded SaxonB, believing the
story, have been persistently crowning our kings and queens on the aforesaid stone ever
since. But what is the fact? "The Stone of Destiny" which we so religiously preserve
at Westminster, and upon which Her moat
Gracious Majesty was crowned, like so
many of her royal ancestors, is not the real
article after all. The Scots were far too
wide awake to part with that. They utterly
imposed upon King Edward by tending
him a shapeless block of sandstone, while
they kept the genuine stone at home. I
have just made a careful examination of it.
It is in perfect preservation in this ancient
burgh of Inverness, and is placed, the better
to deceive the English, under a handsome
fountain in front of the Town Hall.
Of course your Guides and Gnide-Books
have another story about this Stone. It
would never do to tell the truth about it,
after having imposed upon us poor credu-
lous Saxons for six hundred years. But
in this age of critical inquiry it is impos-
sible that the truth can be much longer
concealed, and you will be pleased to hear
that the matter is to be brought under the
notice of the British Association at its next

House of Lord; Monday Night, July 31.—House crowded to-
night. Peers about to assert their place in the British Constitution.
The Commons propose," said my Lord Marquis, stroking his
coal-black beard, "but the Lords dispose."
At present Lords disposed to make a hash of Arrears Bill. My
Lord Marquis moves Amendments in truculent speech. Lord Ca r-
lingford, who follows, seems almost physically weak-knee'd, as he
makes effort to reply. Granville sometimes has pretty conflict
with my Lord Marquis, his strokes being none the less effective because
dealt with a genial smile. Lord
S kerb rook might do it, if he
were not altogether deserted by
the spirit of Bobby Lowe. But
C auxinokord not up to the work,
and performance rather one-
sided. Like the Hatfield Pet
boxing with his dummy.
Great occasion for Lord Cran-
bhook. Uplifts his voice to con-
stitutional pitch. Talks himself
out of breath by the thirtieth
sentence. Fortunately Peers
cheer, and Lord Cranbrook
breathes.
Rather a bad night for Lord
Brabourne, though he must by
this time be getting used to bad
times with the Lords. Has taken
his seat on front Cross Benches,
"ready to make the most of
either side," as the Lord Marquis
sneers. L. M. not very fond of
Braboubne.
"All very well at first to have
a man ratting as soon as he 's
made a Peer. Annoying to the
other side, if not supremely grati-
fying to the side he joins. But manifestations of this kind pall a
little when often repeated. The average Englishman understands
honest political animosity, and enjoys it; but for a man to pose for
a quarter of a century as sound Liberal, to get whatever was going
in the way of place or profit, to propose himself for a Cabinet Office
when his party come back, failing that, unblushingly to ask for a
Peerage, and when he's got it to turn on Gladstone, is all very well
to make a play of for one night, but it doesn't suit a body of English
gentlemen/'
Thus says the Lord Marquis in a loud tone, which betokens that he
doesn't care who hears him. Braboubne made a little way the
other night, by declaring he would not have accepted a Peerage if
he 'd known what Gladstone was capable of. As a touch of humour
from an unaccustomed quarter, this not bad. But it won't last
through the Session. The House cheered uproariously to-night
when the Lobd Chancellor, moved from his usual mild manner,
fell upon the new Peer, and made him think that, after all, there
are thorns in a coronet.

a silver watoh-guard hanging across his waistcoat. (Pflkstos says

Proceedings in Commons for greater part a little dull. In the
earlier part of the sitting the brightest feature in the House was the
Gentleman from Japan, in Distinguished Strangers' Gallery. His
bed-gown of dark azure, shamed the black garb of his neighbours.
Beautiful olive complexion. Rather fancy he's a swell in his own
country. The way his black hair was plaited and brought over his
shoulder in a thick band was quite coquettish. Besides, it prevented
the people in the Speaker's Gallery behind from plucking out hairs
as mementoes of the interesting meeting.

Friday Night.— A pleasant evening, chiefly with Mr. Arthur
O'Connor, Mr. Tin Pot of that ilk, and other descendants from
early kings. Subjects ranged from somebody who'd been doing
something at Mullingar, to somebody else who 'd been leaving some-
thing undone at Carrick-on-Suir. After this had gone on till past
midnight, House got to work, and remained at it till three o'clock in
the morning. This is how we do business in the House of Commons.

SEEING THEM OFF!
[All about it, from Our Own Enthusiast.)
9 a.m.—It is over! The dear big splendid boys are gone! From
2 a.m. this morning I have been clinging to the bar of a lamp-post
opposite the Knightsbridge Barracks, determined to give them a
parting God-speed. At a quarter past nine, however, I was forced
to relinquish my excellent position by a couple of policemen, from
whom, after they had taken my name, I learnt that the Brigade
had, by some mistake, started from Albany Street instead. But it
was not too late. Hurrying to the Docks, I caught them up,
splendid fellows as they are; six hundred of them crammed on the
deck of a penny steamer. A Serene Highness wants to join 'em.
Must keep my eye on him. The Duke came up on a private coal-
barge, crying like a child, and collectingphotographs of the depart-
ing giants in his parade cocked hat. The gallant fellows cheered
him hoarsely as ne moved amongst them, and, when His Royal
Highness said he was so overcome that he had forgotten the names
of all the horses, but that he would have gone as far as Margate
with the Brigade, and have tried to learn them by heart, "if it
hadn't been for the sea," there wasn't a dry eye in the Pool.
1 p.m.—Lost sight of Serene Highness while seeing the officers,
after a happy lunch at Rosnerville, coming on board with the
band. Talk of the good blood of Old England,—if you want to
see it, the next time there's a European crisis, come to Rosher-
ville. There wasn't one of these representative warriors of our
grand old noblesse that wasn't frizzed and curled. It was clear
that every one of them that morning, to quote the wondrous life-
like description of the immortal "Weeder," "had stretched out
his lithe clean-shaped limbs, and had soon drawn on his John
Boots over his white leather pantaloons, that fitted as tightly as the
dress of a harlequin." There they were, the whole twenty-eight of
them, just as she so accurately describes them,—each "with his
breast-plate, sash, tunic, gorget, shirt-of-mail, belt, clean starched
collars, tags, bearskin, epaulettes, spurs, embroidered gauntlets,
regulation moustachios, helmet, and plumes of rainbow hues, looking,
as at the moment of embarkation, "his servant, with all the celerity
of a practised professional hand, fastened on his polished shield and
buckler, and, lastly, attached to his side his glittering sword, with
its jewelled hilt, that had been presented to him by some of the
fairest demoiselles who had seen him pass their windows," the very
beau idial of a British Cavalry Officer prepared to sacrifice himself,
his uniform, and his horse in the service of his country. Some of
them were singing, sadly, " We do want to fiaht, but, by Jingo, if
tee don't!" while others were letting off fireworks as a farewell signal
to friends on shore. A few were refusing to pay their fares, and
one or two, more cautious, were creeping into their berths in the
steerage, unobserved. It was a stirring scene.
But I must close this, for I have to catch 'em again wherever I
get a chance, all along the coast until they reach the Lizard.
7 p.m.—I am writing this in great haste, but much moved, having
just witnessed another never-to-be-forgotten scene. I stopped the
ship off Portland, by putting up the signal " Sealed Orders.' Then
I sent the gallant fellows a free admission for two to the pit of the
Weymouth Theatre in a gummed envelope. The effect was electric.
The whole rigging was instantly filled with the grateful giants,
waving their boots and breastplates, while the Colonel stood on
his head, as he counted twenty, on the top of the mizen-mast.
There wasn't a dry eye on the snore. But I must be off, as I am
once more going to look for His Serene Highness, whom I have
missed, and who meant, I know, to get on board somehow the first
thing to-morrow morning, if he could only get a chance.
10 a.m. Just heard by signal that he has turned up as a stowaway,
having, in the enthusiasm after alight lunch yesterday off Barking,
hid himself in a bulkhead. They are going to let him accompany
the Brigade, and he won't be much in the way. He is to be attached
to the quarter-staff as a supernumerary ophicleide; and the Autho-
rities at the Horse Guards nave just telegraphed that .he is to be
taken about the field at a distance in a green bullet-proof bathing-
machine, and "to be well looked after "by Sir Garnet. Shall
follow them up somehow. More from Gib.

go to the top storey to transact business is, "Please give us a lift."

A VIGNETTE FROM VISIBLE LIFE.
(With acknowledgment to the Author of" Vignettes from Invisible
Life " in the St. James's Gazelle.)
THE STENTORS.
The Stentors are among the most prominent form of social life: of
various classes, callings, and party-colours; and few objects are
more interesting and attractive to the satiric observer. They are,
moreover, easily found and recognised.
They may be regarded—psychologically speaking—as trumpet-
shaped, the expanded end representing the mouth of the creature,
and the remainder its attenuated intelligence. This physical infla-
tion and intellectual tenuity are very singular, for by reason of them
the creature can contract itself—in one sense—into an infinitesimally
small compass, like a maggot in a nutshell, and—in another sense —
expand at will to abnormal bulk, like a blown bladder. Also, by
these means, it enters the condition of social life. A number will
congregate together, and form a social colony, coterie or clique—
secreting a viscid slaver, by means of which they attach themselves
in groups in any locality. Thus, if you collect a number, and place
them in a club-room, or a bar-parlour, with some potables and pipes,
in a short time they will be Been posing in ungraceful, but pompous
attitudes (mentally), head downwards, or (intellectually) upside
down, sprawling incontinently all over a subject, social, scientific,
literary, artistic, or—by preference—political.
Any fine morning of the year, walking through the central tho-
roughfares of London, or riding in the conveyances journeying
thither, you may come upon agitated groups, like black dolphins
tumbling energetically together in a turbid Bea, the illusion being
apparently confirmed by the masses of white (newspaper) drifting
and billowing to right and left, as they struggle with the broadsheets
and their emotions. Viewed from above, these street Stentors are
like so many " animated hats" tumbling and rolling about in—more
or less—delight. All the race of Stentors are provided with vocife-
rous voices, which, vibrating with furibond passion, enable them to
perform, without weariness or exhaustion, the main function of
their blatant being. This function is to shout angry, dogmatic, and
pragmatical nonsense in the unwilling ears of a wearied world.
There are some Stentors who seem to approach a higher form of
life, in that they surround themselves with a protective paper-like
case, or retreat (known as " press anonymity "), in which they take
refuge on the slightest alarm. This power to secrete themselves in
a papery covering is of essential service at a period of their lives
when the important operation of self-division (known, metaphori-
cally, as "ratting," or turning one's back on oneself) has to be
performed, as with Stentors it often has.
The Stentor Polymorphic has, as its name implies, the power of
changing its form. Now it is—as it were — trumpet-like, and
attached to war policy and a Jingo journal. Presently it will detach
itself and turn—metaphorically—into a housewife's thimble, and in
this form lead a free if acrid life, moving rapidly through the stages
of carping criticism, snarling abuse, and preposterous and unpatriotio
cantankerousness. The bodies of these creatures are very plastic,
and change rapidly. But they carry one quality unimpaired through
all their transformations, namely their Btrident staccato vociferous-
ness.

"Isn't it sport with a hobby to hunt?"
"Happy to welcome you into the pack,"
Said Wilfred Blunt to Sir Wilfrid L.
"Thank you. You manage your hobby so well!

Said angry John Bull unto Blunt and Lawson,
"You both want a bridle your indiscreet jaws on!"

[By a Gaiety HabituJ.)
The Burlesque Style, which
Scarron used with such skill,
though he oan hardly claim to
have invented it, has had its
partisans and detractors. _ The
word Burlesque, in itself, is not
very anoient. It was not known
in France or England before 1640
or 1650. Sabbazia, according to
Menaq k, is the first who used it
in France, where it was known
by the term "grotesque." The
etymology of "grotesque" is
grutta,—from which we get the
term " grotto "—a name given to
ancient chambers discovered by
excavation, the walls of whioh
were covered with an odd mixture
representing animals, plants, and
architectural ornaments. "Bur-
lesque" comes from the Italian
Burla, which signifies a joke, or
a mockery, and from which the
Italians derive the words Bur-
lesco and Burlare, adopted and
modified in English in the term
Burletta. Burla, though used
as Italian in Italy, is really a
Castilian term. In Spain, certain
hidden jets of water, which spring
up suddenly under the feet of
unsuspioious passers-by, are called
Burladores. The Comedy of Tirso
de Molina, which served as a
model for the Don Juan of Mo-
lierk, is named El Burlador de

Five-and-twentt years ago,
when the first model lodging-

by Lady Burdett-Coutts, the
homes of weavers and coster-
mongers were destroyed for the
erection of a philanthropic bar-
rack in which no costermonger's
cart or weaver's shuttle was
allowed admission. The Peabody
Trustees in Drurv Lane and
Whitecross Street have followed
this bad example. They have
run-a-muck at trucks in one
place, and shown a most unnatural
want of sympathy with donkeys
in another. Columbia Market,
Great Wild Street, and the slums

called "Improvements.

have the Premiership who can manage to get a Cabinet together, and
not be beaten in the Chamber more than once a fortnight. This
condition rather exacting on the part of Grevy, but have resolved
to try; and eleven francs courses looking up Left Centre-ists.
Wonder if courses oan be deducted from salary.
Tuesday.—The Left Centre-ists don't seem to care about it. Think
that intervention ought to go as far as Suda Bay, and no further;
while the Centre-ists (they might be oalled Centre-bits, they 're so
small) won't enter any Cabinet that doesn't contain at least one
Visoount. And, it's strange, but Yiscounts in our days don't seem
to run to Statesmen, as a rule. They run horses instead, and some-
times they run to Belgium afterwards. More courses, and finally to
Grevy's with result of interviews. Doesn't appear to think it par-
ticularly brilliant, but suggests a Ministere de Combat, as being
likely to rouse the Chamber into having something like a majority-
just as by vigorous stirring you can make oil and vinegar mix into a

Clemenceau insists on Rochefort for Education and Les Cultea.

abrogation of all commercial treaties. Grevy almost rude over his
billiards, when I bring him the news.
Thursday.—Ministere de Dissolution all day, and have ceased to
count courses. Wish cabmen would. Nobody will join this
Ministry, except those politicians who are so popular as to be quite
sure of re-election—and if we 're to have popular people in the Cabinet
—ah, bien non, alors! .
Friday.—Ministere de Conciliation formed at last—that is if we
can get over the first Cabinet Council without throwing inkstands at

Tims Past— Crinoline Era.

Time Present—Fan Development.
THE DOUBT OE THE BENEFIT.
Mb. Irving took a benefit and apologised for it. Quite right. An
abuse which is indefensible needs an apology, though we shall make
no apology for abusing an abuse. At the same time we shall
always heartily commend the proper and legitimate use of a Benefit,
which, got up under " distinguished patronage," was meant to re-
imburse the needy and deserving Author or Actor, or Author-Actor
where both callings were combined in one person, who had sustained
loss in his honest endeavours to amuse the public.
The Manager of the Lyceum, we are glad to say, cannot plead
poverty as his reason for taking a Benefit. It is not to put money in
his purse that he announces his Benefit,—though that it does add to
his funds he admits as the merest detail,—but he fondly " clings" to
the Benefit Night as a sort of good old genial theatrical custom for
which he has a sentimental regard, and which serves him as an
excuse for gathering about him a dress-circle of admirers who will
listen to a speech from the throne, and give him an extra ovation.
He likes, on such a delightful occasion, to be their spokesman, to
express their sentiments, to speak for them in their name, as well as
to them in his own. All very charming, friendly, sociable, and har-
monious. Only why make use of the Benefit machinery which was
intended for a charitable purpose? Surely, if all that Mr. Irving
wants is to gather his friends round him in order to make them a
Eleasant and affable speech about Lyceum retrospects and prospects,
e could insure a crowded audience by issuing tickets of invitation
for a meeting at his theatre in the afternoon, or at night after the
performance, when he could speak for an hour or so if he liked, and
then dismiss them with his blessing, or, if he wished to make a sort
of birthday festivity of it, he could throw in a supper—a supper-
numerary attraction—and he could say, by way of old-fashioned
"tag," "If our friends in front will only accept my little hospi-
tality, I am sure that no happier party will sit down this night
than Yours truly, Henry Ibvlng and Company Limited."
Mr. Ibvino pleads the previous example of many great masters
of my art"—who were not ashamed to take Benefits. No: and on
one of these occasions, to add to the attraction, Edmund Eean danced
as a Harlequin, and sang Tom Tug's song in The Waterman, in
imitation of Incxedow. Would Mr. Irving follow him in this
eccentricity? Why not? The announcement that he would dance
as John d Aubaw, or sing as Sims Reeves, would draw a big house,
and he would have the authority of, at all events, one of "the
great masters of my art" as a precedent.
Would Mr. Ibvino be thoroughly Shakspearian ?" Certainly,"
says Mr. Dutton Cook, a most trustworthy guide, in his Book
of the Play, "in Shaksfeabe's time, the Aotors knew nothing
of Benefits." And he goes on to point out that at this period
the Actor was " looked upon as if close kin to the rogue and the
vagabond, and with degrading possibilities in connection with the
stocks and whipping-post never wholly remote from his profes-
sional career." Nowadays, the only stocks known practically to
the prosperous Actor, are those in which he invests his money.
"An Elizabethan player," says Mr. D. Cook, "would probably
have been deemed guilty of a most unpardonable impertinence,"
had he announced a complimentary," or " special Benefit."
Benefits grew out of "Authors' Nights," the raison d'etre of
which lay in the poverty of the Dramatists, who were so parsimo-
niously treated by Managers; and there was, subsequently, an
excuse for Actors' Benefits, when, as in Bettebton's time, the
salary of a leading Actor was only four pounds a week. Benefits,
whether for Authors or Actors, were usually associated with
the idea of previously insufficient remuneration, or some other
temporary necessity. After a while, onoe more to quote our Mr.
Cook, "To draw a crowded house, and bring money to the Treasury,
was the only aim."
The reasons that led the Eton authorities to abolish the " Montem,"
which had grown into an abuse, would, we apprehend, apply to the
discontinuing of the Benefit system as it is now practised. Once
discountenanced by the theatre-going Public, it will be discontinued
by the Theatrical Profession.
We would see the charitable use of the Benefit system retained,
and the theatre-goer's contribution would then be applied to de-
serving objects.
Mr. Irving is an admirable Comedian, an occasionally impressive
Tragedian, a nervously painstaking Actor, and, generally, an indif-
ferent Elocutionist. Still, with all his faults and mannerisms, from
which no original Artist, Writer, Orator, or Actor can be entirely
free, the Lyoeum Manager is a popular favourite, because everyone
who wishes well to the Drama is as firmly convinced as we are our-
selves, that, among all the Actors, there is not one who has the true
interests, professional and social, of the Stage more at heart than
Mr. Henby Ibvino; and as we cordially and ungrudgingly wish
him every possible success, so we should be the more satisfied
with him personally if he would take the initiative, and, instead
of sentimentally apologising for the continuance of an abuse, boldly
reform it altogether, and do his best to banish it from the Stage.
Melbitby Road News.—Ex-King Cetewato is located all among
the Artists. He is developing a taste for
Sunflowers and Dados. He has been advised
by Mr. Val Pbinsep to go to a picture-cleaner's
in order to be " restored." On his restoration,
Mr. Y. P. will be offered a seat in the Znluland
Cabinet at the first Dark Stance.

The theatrical bookseller, Mr. Fbench—a
most appropriate name for a vendor of British
dramatic works—advertises a Handy Make-up
Box for Aotors. In the list of necessary articles
included is "a puff." Of course this, to an
Actor, is indispensable.
Annoyed by the reticent character of the

THE SPENDTHRIFT'S GUIDE.—No. IV.
To relieve the monotony of spending money for his solitary grati-
fication, the Spendthrift should think how it is best to spend money
for the gratification of others. There are various ways of doing this.
Dinner-parties, four-horse coaohes, diamond rings, bracelets, testi-
monials, &c, are all, more or less, old-fashioned. Invention and
enterprise are as necessary in extravagance as in business. The
Spendthrift mnBt look round his native city with an intelligent eye,
and see what public want he oan supply on a scale that is worthy of
his capital. He will not have to look far. He will find nearly four
millions of patient stupid people, taxed from the soleB of their feet
to the roots of their hair, ridden to death by Bumbledom and licensing
systems, with far less social liberty that the despised Russian, living
in the greatest city in the world without a single Casino or Music-
garden. Casinos and Music-gardens are not the one thing needful,
or the breath of life, but they are things that no other great city has
consented to do without, and which Englishmen can be trusted with
as safely as Germans or Frenchmen.
The Spendthrift will see his opportunity, and act upon it. He will
buy a mansion and grounds from an embarrassed nobleman (there
are plenty about) which he will throw open to the Public, free of
oharge. He will go to several cities on the Continent, where music
is not so much a profession as a recreation, and he will select a number
of musioians to form an orchestra. He will light his grounds with
the Eleotric Light, if he can find any Eleotrician not too busy with
company-mongering to attend to him, and he will engage a proper
staff of Masters of the Ceremonies to conduct the dancing in a spirit
worthy of the late Beau Nash, and the late Baron Nathan. He will
decorate his grounds with statues of the most prominent obstructives
on the Middlevex Bench. Thomas Caslyle has received this
indignity, and why not a Middlevex Magistrate? Our Spendthrift's
danoes will take place six nights a week, and his band will play every
day and night, including Sundays.
He will occasionally be prosecuted. In a country with twenty
licensing authorities, and only one fish-sauce, he can hardly expect
to be free from this amusing annoyance. He will occasionally be
fined. He will pay the fines. He will have several lawsuits
brought against him. He will defend them, and make arrangements
with his capital to carry them on for ten or twenty years. The New
Law Courts will make this process a little more expensive, but
expense, in this case, is only an amusement. A Lunaoy Commissioner
will be sent to see him by the Government. He will receive the
Commissioner with full musical honours, and pension him off with
twice the Government honorarium. When he has been proceeded
against by every legal power given to the Sacred Jackasses who rule
the Kingdom of Fools, it will be found that he has done little more
than the Emperor of Austria is doing every day in a portion of the
Palace Gardens at Vienna.
Cabbiagis are not to be taxed, but Income-tax payers are to pay
eightpence in the pound to keep our high road to India in good
repair. So we 're toll'd.

Foreigner (in Paris, on a Quai by the Seiiie). "I bat, 'Abrt, what A LOT o'
Baths that feller Bain must 'a dot 'ki;k!"
'Arry. "O Lob, v«s—Scotchman v' know—thbt tdkn up kykkywiif.uk!"
"THE TWELFTH" IN TOWN.
Happy Thought.—Hooray for the Twelfth—" the Glorious Twelfth!"....
Stop! • On second Happy Thought, why have I quoted that? How do I come
to call it, quite naturally, and without any effort, "the Glorious Twelfth P"
With what is it associated— besides grouse P "Grouse " and "Glorious" both
begin with "G," but that oan't be the reason. Of course, it can't be called
"the Glorious," in the annals of a country, simply because people go out grouse-
shooting on this day.
Why "Glorious P" It isn't the celebration of American Independence.
No, that was last month. My reason for being certain that this ctlebration
was last month (if not the month before) is because there was a big ball given
in honour of the day, and I ought to have been there if 1 had been asked,
which I wasn't, but was told afterwards that, had I shown myself, I should
have been welcome. Rather glad I didn't show myself, or might have been
shown up, and then shown out.
But why " the Glorious Twelfth "? Is it a familiar name of a regiment,
or the anniversary of some great victory P or am I entirely wrong, and it isn't
and never was "the Glorious " at all, which term is applied, probably, to quite
another day, and a totally different occasion?
_ Anyhow, I 've called it "the Glorious,'' and, therefore, if this is perfectly
original, it must have been an inspiration. (On the subject of " Inspiration"—
see my notes fur the Fifty-Fourth Volume of Typical Development*, letter " I,"
which is in course of preparation with titty-three others- all in a more or less
advanced state. This is to be my magnum opus—a magnum holding two
bottles. However, this has nothing to do with it; at least, I don't think so.)
But to-day it the " Glorious Twelfth." It is glorious in town. It is lovely
weather. There is a delightfully refreshing breeze. Omnibus-drivers, perched
up aloft, feel it, and smile pleasantly. HanEom cabmen also like it, and also
smile affably. Growlers feel it lees, but appear inclintd to be polite. Every-
body in town knows everybody else. We all smile at one another as we walk
along this splendid morning. Yes," we appear to be saying to one another as
we pass without speaking. "I 'm in town, so are you. Never met you before,
but seem to know you. How are you? Isn't town delightful?" So it is.
Cabs are not overworked, Cabmen are civil and thankful for small mercies;
horses, not being tired, can step out, and have plenty of room to step out, the
thoroughfares being cleared as if for a procession.
Also, it is a pretty day in town. Every one with any
experience, and half an eye— [Happy Thought.—One
half an eye doesn't see what the other half does. Also,
another new proverb, "Don't let your right eye see what
your left eye" but this is trenching on dangerous
ground. New Proverbs are wanted. Will think out a
few.]—knows there are Pretty Days and Ugly Days in
town. Some days pretty faces are meeting you, going east
or west as the case may be. Other days everyone is ugly.
How I pity the poor chaps on the moors! Of course I
feel for our children in arms—infantry and cavalry—
in Egypt; only that it must to-day be too hot to do any-
thing—even flies and mosquitoes must be tired of biting.
Last year I was on the moors. Then—let me see, dad
I pity the poor people compelled to remain in Town P
Why am I not on the moors P Well—why was I not
at that American Independence Ball mentioned above?
When my friend, M Canistkb., sees this, he will write,
"Dear Boy, why stop to be asked t" [Happy Thought.
—Why not asked to stop ?]
It is delightful in town, and really I hate a gun, it
makes such a noise, hurts your shoulder (my shoulder
I'm speaking of), and, as Hamlet says of the skull,
"smells so." Yes; I prefer London on "the Glorious
Twelfth "—(why "glorious?" Must find this out, and
note it.)—and I like to see everyone looking so happy and
?leased, and all smiling at me. Why do they do itP
s it because I 'm smiling at them? Happy Thought.—
Step up to glass and catoh myself in the act. Yes
. . . (in Club looking-glass, which I have all to my-
self) ... I do look happy . . . Can it be because
Unified went up three-quarters to an eighth (or some-
thing like that on the Stock Exchange Barometer) and
Ai.ick Bcstek wrote to tell me I 'd made two pound
ten, which, as I 'd risked losing five hundred, is satis-
factory P Perhaps that (on analysis) is why Jam smiling.
But why is everybody smiling at me f Have they all done
the same thing? Or is it my new white hat P Rather
be in and out of—well out of—Egyptians than on the
Moors. This day year I may he shooting— so moor in
my next, but no moor at present.
Happy Thought Proverb for the Twelfth.—" The Moor
the Merrier!" [Haven't time to work this out, but evi-
dently it's a basis to go upon.]

CROWNED HEADS AND SHILLING DAYS.
The splendid hospitality universally extended by the Chairman and Direotors
of the Crystal Palace to any Royal Personages that happen to be strolling about
the Metropolis for a few days, has not been slow in pouncing on the Ex-Monarch
of the Zulus. Our good-natured friend Cetkwato, though debarred by a British
cold at the last moment from appearing after lunch on an iron gallery, and
going through the ordinary form of such "royal ovation" as can be got from
bowing his acknowledgments to Thirty Thousand Shilling Visitors, who regard
him as included in the programme, was nevertheless intended to form no in-
considerable feature in the day's attractions. The advertisement, which well
mixed up his unconscious Majesty, with the Company's Band, the Electrio Ex-
hibition, to say nothing of the refreshment department, and random performances
on the great organ, was a model of courtly announcement; cleverly too were his
personal friends and valet interlined with the fireworks. Sydenham is, in fact,
quite awake to the occasion, and we shall, together with Lord Kihrerlbt, look
out for next week's "Bombardment" Advertisement with much lively interest.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

COLLISION AVOIDED!—WONDERFUL PRESENCE OF MIND OF THE SWITCH-MAN AT ST. STEPHEN'S STATIjNM
Mosdat Night, August 7.—Cetewayo came down to-day, and
took a look at us from the Gallery. Didn't think much of the
place, preferring the House of Lords. Thinks he will have windows
like those when he goes back to Zululand. Went up, and had a
chat with the King. Found him a little bored, and very footsore.
Says Civilisation would be endurable only for its boots. Doesn't
take kindly to trousers.
"I draw the line at the waistcoat, Tony," he said to me, through
the interpreter. "Also, if you get a black or blue blanket, and cut
it out with holes and sleeves, and put buttons on it, nice bright
brass ones, mind you, and oall it a coat, and say I must wear it, good.
But why you should take a useful blanket, cut it up the middle,
and sew it together like a double-barrelled gun so as to make it
uncomfortable about the legs, goes beyond me. As for your
boots, Toby, they're simply flying in the face of Providence.
Look here!" he said. And throwing upon the seat a leg of the
girth of Pompey's Pillar, he displayed a boot of the size of one of
the smaller Committee-Rooms. "What do I want going about in a
thing like that? It's roomy, I admit: but also it's heavy. I mean
to keep this pair, carry them home to Zululand, and try the effect of
one on John Dunn, taking him from the rear at a run of eighteen
yards. I hear your people use them in Lancashire, to bring their
wives round to a full sense of their domestie responsibilities. But
I haven't got a wife with me; and if I kick other people's, I under-
stand there would be unpleasantness. That's one of the intricacies
of your law, whioh I oannot understand, and don't want to under-
stand. As soon as ever I get to my lodgings, the first thing 1 do
is to slip these boots off; but whilst I am out they play Old Harry
with me."
This, it will be understood, is a pretty free rendering of the
King's observations, after the style of Mr. Blunt's translation of
Arabi Bet's letter to Mr. Gladstone.
Cetewato wanted to know how old the Speaker was, and who
plaited his nioe long grey hair. Also greatly admired his club,
which was lying on the table before him. Wanted to know if he
might have it to play with a few minutes. Proposed to practise on
his hairdresser. Told him this was the Mace. Said it didn't matter;
wouldn't be any difference to his hairdresser ten minutes after the
game had begun. Told him it must not be. King went away rather
huffed.
Business done.—Snpply.
Tuesday Night.—Great House to-night. Members whistled in
from all parts of the country. My Lord Marquis, been trying to
coerce the Commons. Nothing better calculated to wake up the
spirit of Commons, getting a little drowsy at this time of the Ses-
sion. Great show of white hats and summer vests. Grand Old Man
comes out quite young in white waistcoat, sixt« en-shilling trousers,
a yellow rose in his button-hole, and his collar like the mainsail of
a yacht.
In the interesting match between Bobby Spencer and the Premier,
Bobby nowhere. Certainly Weo, "with characteristic subtlety,"
as Drt/mmond-Wolff says, got Bobby into the match on unequal
terms. B. wears a dog-collar, and, the higher it mounts, the nearer
it goes to cutting him off by the jaws. Of dauntless spirit, and
grim determination, Bobby has, by hard training and the con-
centration of a powerful mind, succeeded in wearing a higher
collar than any living being, not a giraffe.
"If you give your mind to it, and are content to sit up now and
then all night with your collar, you can do almost anything," he
says. But the Grand and wily Old Man, when the match was
arranged, expressed an innocent preference for a collar that olosed
over the oheek. Consequence is he oan go to any height, and does,
whilst Bobby's aspirations are limited by his chin. Still Bobby won't
give in.
"The Old Guard choke, but never surrender," he says. Goes about
with pale, resolute look, and ever-heightening collar. Wilfrid
Lawson, who sits near him, says he expects some day, upon a sudden
jerk, to see his head rolling down the Gangway.
To-night, Gladstone's collar up, and his choler down. Nothing
could exceed the graoiousness of manner with which he concedes
to the Lords chiefly nothing. My Lord Marquis declared the
Arrears Bill must be made optional. Mr. Gladstone blandly says
that can't be, and the Commons by a swingeing majority of 136
support him.
My Lord Marquis's turn to speak next.
Business done.—Lords' Amendments rejected.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Stroke of good luck for Land-Leaguers
this afternoon. Thought they must at last discuss the Constabulary
Vote, after having kept it oft for several nights. Have discovered
sudden interest in Constabulary. Sexton, who a short time ago de-
livered long indictment against them, exciting even the indignation
of Mr. Cai.lan, now protests that they are hardly used. Men must
be supported in difference with the Government.
Trkvelyak says "Pass this vote including a trifle, £180,000, as
pour boire for Police. Let me go over to Ireland and 1 '11 soon settle
matters."
But Land-Leaguers' in their" newly-born anxiety" for interest of
Police prevent vote being taken. To-day doubly delighted. Got a
shot at Lyon Playfair, and prevented Constabulary Vote coming
on. Joseph Gillis, a little depressed of late, begins to think life is
worth living. Raikes made a clever speech clearly proving Ltow
Playfair in the wrong, and winding up by patronising him.
Seems to me, speaking diffidently as a young Member, that this dead
set on Lyon Playfair is neither fair nor justifiable. Playfair is
really the first Chairman who has «had to deal with organised and
triumphant Obstruction. 11 vi k ks had a bit of it, but it was in the
melifluous times of the Major, and when Parnell had neither his
position nor his following. All very well to point out next morning
now something could have been done better. Nobody else has yet
had opportunity to try. When the time oomes, expect we shall look

family, and begin to move gently but firmly backward. _ On reflec-
tion My Lord Marquis sees he can't very well go over himself, but
determines to let everybody know how
Noble Lords have behaved.
Delightful to see Earl Granville's
genial smile as he listens to narrative.
A little later Lord Limerick proposes
to go over a precipice on his own
account. Will divide House on Lord
Waterford's Amendment. Lord
Waterford in great trepidation.
"For Heaven's sake don't," he whis-
pers to Lord Limerick. House cleared
for a Division. Lord Granville
wishes to drop a word of warning.
Can do so only when seated and with
hat on. Hasn't got a hat; looks wildly
round. Makes a grasp at Lord
Rosebert's. But Kosebbby's hat
new. Not going to have it knocked
about on first day. So doesn't see
Granville's gesture. At length
Foreign Secretary foregoes the hat,
and drops a word of gentle warning
without it, smiling sweetly all the
time. Lord Limerick led away, and
Bill passes. My Lord Marquis all the
time sitting with head well up, star-
ing stolidly at the roof.
Reminds me," says Sir Charles
Fobstir, regarding him meditatively,
"of the wise man mentioned in Scrip-

and fell in it himself."
Business done.—Arrears Bill passed
through Lords.
Friday Night.— Tremendous lot of business done to-night. Every-
body tired of talking, and anxious for business. Bills advanced
stages, and Votes agreed to by the half-dozen.
"After all, Toby," the Speaker said, "the House of Commons is

end—it is all wind. We shove it down and down till it gets to
the August end, and. then business goes off with a pop."

English have their pigeon-matches; the Spaniards have their bull-
fights. One or two weak-minded rulers of Spain have endeavoured
to remove this disgrace from their country, but of course they have
failed. They might as well try to upset Jeremy Diddlerism in their
Finance as to depose King Torreador—the elect of the people!
No Spanish city is complete without its bull-ring. Writers who
have had the inestimable advantages of a classical education, tell us
that the bull-ring is the great-grandson of the Roman Arena, and
that while the parents of civilisation gloated over the sufferings of
dying gladiators, their Castilian descendants are content with the
agonies of butchered horses and bulls. The horses that are tortured
may be the most wretched "screws," but, for all that, they repre-
sent the sacred mystery of life.
The bull-ring is a gigantic circus, capable, in cities like Madrid
and Seville, of seating fifteen thousand people. On Sundays and
holidays, in the bull-fighting season, it is crowded with a representa-
tive audience of amateur butchers. The scum of the population is
there in all the majesty of numbers, while rank and fashion are
headed by Royalty or a Mayor. The entertainment might be thus
described in the bills which plaster every wall of the city :—
The Dancing Butchers;
or, the Biort Beef in tub Wrong Place.
Flags are flying, a brass-band is bleating, men are selling oranges,
and nothing but drink is wanting to remind the home-sick English-
man of his native land. The Show begins with [a procession of
Torreadors gaily, even richly, dressed, who look like glorified Figaros
about to give the spectators a Spanish ballet. They are really pre-
paring for a dance—sometimes the dance of death. The ring is
cleared, the door of the bulls' den swings slowly open, and the first
bull gallops into the ring. Three or four clumsy picadors, with
padded legs, mounted on horses and armed with heavy spears, and
the gaily-dressed Figaros, provided with gaudy table-cloths, are
spread round the ring to receive him. The horses are mostly grey,
because that colour shows off the blood. The bull "goes" at a
•ador, and, holding his head low, overturns both horse and man.
The dancing-butchers then skip round the bull, and distract his
attention by flourishing the gaudy table-cloths. The bull, being a
born fool, allows his attention to be drawn off the clumsy picador,
who is lifted on his legs. The horse, if not ripped to death, is
prodded into an upright position; and if he is spurred round the
circle with his red protruding bowels dragging under him in the
dust, the delight of the swinish multitude knows no bounds. When
all the picadors have been dismounted, and all their wretched
animals gored to death, while the bull is bleeding from a score of
spear-thrusts received from the picadors, who have tried to keep
him at bay, the gaudy table-cloths are allowed to descend on the
First Act of the drama.
The Second Act begins with a playful game, in which the Torreadors,
or Dancing Butchers, give up the name of Matadors, or throwers of
table-oloths, and become Bandilleroe. The Bandilleros are furnished
with short spears, like thick arrows, or darts, decorated with bunches
of recruiting sergeants' ribbons. These darts are stuck, one after
the other, in the back of the bull, and here the misplaced courage,
activity, and skill of the Torreadors are shown. When all the gaudy
darts nave been fixed, and the bull is sufficiently enraged, and
partially exhausted, the Second Aet of the Faroial-Tragedy closes.
In the third, and last Act, the Torreador becomes an Espada, and
enters the ring alone, with a coloured cloak and a sword. He informs
the King, or Mayor, or whoever may be the Chairman of the meeting,
that he will kill the bull, but sometimes, though not often, the bull
kills the Espada. The fight—like the whole of the proceedings—is
carried on according to the strictest rules, drawn up and sanctioned
by the wisdom of ages. The bull is kept at bay by the cloak, until
the fitting moment arrives, when the variegated Butcher, rising on
tip-toe, plunges his sword up to the hilt in the back of the baited
animal, amidst the frantic applause of the multitude of Butcher-
Worshippers. The band strikes up a Mabille tune of the latest
Parisian brand; the gory remains of the wretched «Tiimal«—the bull
and horses—
"Butchered to make a Spanish holiday,"
are dragged out of the circus by mules half-covered with bells; the
attendants rake the sand over the trail of blood, and thering is pre-
pared for five more Farcial-Tragedies of a precisely similar pattern.
Beef should not be killed any more than dirty linen should be
washed in public Bull-fighting will not be put down, until bulls
are taught to go at one thing at a time. When this result is arrived at,
and bulls are able to kill Torreadors as easily as Torreadors now
destroy bulls, bull-fighting will become as much a thing of the past
as the pleasant game of quarter-staff. But what on earth do they
want with bull-fights at Klines? A Nimes-itation.

received intimation that the gas and water will be both " cut off"

the Professor of Natural Science for the sake of preserving the
prestige of the College, to try to introduce these disagreeable occur-

experiments. He is nice about it; says he will do his best. Things

than last week. This one won't stir without £179 Is. I0d., so I 've

International Grammar.
Oub Continental neighbours, some of them, are somewhat urgently
insisting on the neutralisation of the Suez Canal. How will this
square with "fluviorum, ut Tibris, Orontes," in the Propria qua
maribus t According to that rule, Rivers are masculine, and oan't
be neutralised. But then, to be sure, a Canal is not a River. The
Latin Grammar does not specify Canals. Rivers are personified, as
male—for instance, Old Father Thames. We talk of Old Nile, but
not of Old Suez—or, as we should rather say, New Suez—of River
Gods, but not Canal Gods. If the Suez Canal is not necessarily
masculine, no more is it feminine, and being neither, ought, there-
fore, all the rather to be regarded as neuter.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
QUELQUES SHOWS.
Pluck not Luck (?)—What is it in Wych Street ?—Return of the Natives.
The story of £50,000, now being told nightly at Drury Lane, is, to
quote the eminent burlesque inebriate, Captain Crosttree, " Rather
uonfoozelum."
It commences with an effective set, called an "English Home."
The garden is remarkable for a pair of enormous iron gates, perhaps
obtained secondhand, as an
afterthought, by the econo-
mical proprietor of the
English Home, as they are
quite out of proportion
to the house. There is
also a large spreading oak-
tree, so inconveniently plan-
ted that most of the branches
seem to grow through the
French windows into the back
drawing-room of the mansion,
the abode of a Mr. John Tem-
pleton, banker, who avowedly
neglects his business to talk
sentiment to his only daugh-
ter. He is visited by Sir John
Bennett's Twin Brother (the
Aotor had an alias in the play-
bill, but it was the Twin Sir
John), who has adopted Mr.
A Habbis—Jack Springfield
in the bill, or why not Spring-
heel'd Jack at once?)-as his
■ion, probably for the reason that he was a young gentleman likely
to be quite up to the time of day, and to know to a second " what
o'clock it was." Spring-heeFd Jack appears to have thrived by the
arrangement. To put it prettily, he is "getting a big boy now,"
and he embodies "Pluck." Florence Templeton (Miss Caroline
Hill), the daughter of the sentimental and neglectful banker, is
also an inmate of the "English Home," to which comes Stephen
Clinton (Mr. Barnes), portly and smiling, but horribly villainous,
and one Peter Keene (Mr. Nicholls), who, in the First Act,
might have been described as "the Avenger," and in all the
others as "a drivelling wag." And here it may be remarked
that the Authors of the piece seem to have been uncertain about
this character. Consequently, in the First Act Peter Keene is as
tragic as Edmund Eean, and in all the others as comically eccentric
as a Clown in a Christmas Pantomime. Peter Keene is drunk in
the First Tableau, and he is in precisely the same slate in the

Lulls' House-" Let in Flats'

The Safe Man.
Seventh. "Same drunk, Massa"—so it is a well-sustained, or, as
"well" suggests temperance, we would say it is a spiritedly-sus-
tained character. Spring-heerd Jack contends with Stephen for
the hand of Florence Templeton, which he would obtain but for
the villainy of smiling Mr. Barnes, who has been dodging about,
hiding (now we see the artful use of that big tree) and eavesdropping,
and who now charges the Spring-heel'd one with being a thorough-
paced scoundrel, which the embodiment of Pluck,—there ought to
nave been a representative'of Pyke, as the two, Messrs. Pyke and
Pluck, were inseparables in Nicholas Nickleby,—who has accepted
the temporary guardianship of a defaulting Stockbroker's wife and
child (thrust upon him all ot a sudden, and without the slightest
warning), is unable to disprove. So the Twin Sir John Bennett
turns the unfortunate Sprtng-heel'd Jack out of the English home,
while Florence throws him over there and then, without losing a
moment (one can't stop to think when you 're well in for a sensa-
tional drama), and gives her hand to the wicked but now tri-
umphantly-smiling Stout Stephen. The laugh, however, is taken
out of him by the appearance of Peter Keene as a tragedian, who
says " No you don't!" and the Curtain falls. Muoh applause; cheers
for Spring-heel'd Jack, and howls for his opponent.
Tableau II. introduces us to " the Wedding Breakfast," or rather a
view of the door of the room where the wedding breakfast is taking
filace. The servants are gathered in the hall, and on the staircase,
eaving the whole of the waiting on the guests to be performed by
a comic housekeeper. Stout Stephen is just off for his honeymoon,
when he is opportunely confronted by Spring-heel'd Jack, and, in
presence of the guests, is accused of forgery, arrested, and taken off.
In Tableau III. everybody is going up to London by the 9'15
train, which Peter Keene, not as Avenger, but as comic praotical-
joking villain, has undertaken to upset, to please the stout villain

Mi-sra Harris and Pellitt playing at Trains, and arranging the
Loco-" motive* " of the Drama.
He does so, by placing a sleeper on the line. Then ensues a
fearfully thrilling scene. A train, moving at the pace of at least
a mile an hour, and making the noise of a dozen fiery traction-
engines, comes puffing and blowing, with very broken-winded and
beUows-to-mend action, along the line, until, utterly overcome by
the awful pace which kills, it stumbles over the sleeper, breaks
down, the engine rearing up in the air, and stopping there, as if
challenging another engine of its own size and weight to do the same;
which challenge is immediately accepted, as another engine tnteia
quietly on the opposite side—its name should be The Anti-Climax -
stumbles over something, and rears itself up also in exact imitation
of the first. To add to the horrors of the catastrophe, a load of squibs
and crackers, which the last train was apparently carrying (pro-
bably for some country fete), suddenly explodes; and on this
Tableau, of two terrifio pasteboard steam-engines in fighting-cock
attitude, the Curtain descends. In this scene Mr. Harris greatly
distinguished himself. He divided his time
impartially between saving beauty in distress,
as the hero, and superintending the collision, as
Pluck's producer.*
Tableau IV. The Banker's sanctum in his
English Home. A nice snug little study, the
width of Drury Lane stage and half the length
— (problem for arithmetician, to determine
size of entire house) — cosily illuminated by
twenty-four gas-lights in candelabras, and one
lamp. Here stout Stephen murders the Banker
(when the twenty-four gas-lights are out), and
Peter Keene witnesses the deed through the
keyhole of the patent air-tight Safe.
Tableau V. We are outside a Bank during
the Panic, or, apparently, a Glass Pane-ic, as
the crowd take to playing at smashing the
windows, and the excitement of the audience
reaches its climax when a man, with a pickaxe,
rushes in, and, regardless of expense, smashes a
pane of glass, worth, at the very least, two
shillings 1 Upon this telling incident the
Curtain descends, and at supper we drink to
this act of genuine glass-smashing in a real glass of Shampane.
Bravo, Pluck!
The concluding Tableaux are rather disappointing. In the first
we are shown the exterior of the Criterion during a capitally
managed snowstorm, which exhibits the resources of the Management
* He was obliged to come out very strong, we expect. On the night we saw
the piece, an accident happeued to tiie train off the stage, and Spring-heel'd
Jack, who ought to have been lying Benseless, was obliged to raise himself
up, to see why on earth that confounded train didn't come up to time. He
beckoned to it, or we should say, he tignalled to it, but it wouldn't move. It
was evidently a train on the Hituhin line, and so the Curtain came down only
to ascend again in very fe w seconds, when on came the train without its
tunnel, rather staggery. The smash was done to-righta, and the audience
once more applauded the Managerial Pluck. Why should Spring-heel'd
Jack have been so very hoarse in the next Act t He mutt huv _• been itronjly
advi-ing the carpenters not to miss that train again.

'That one should smile
and smile and smile,
and be a villain."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEL
HOME AND FOREIGN
PIGEON-SHOOTING.
Perhaps the notice of the
Home Secretary, in reading
the foreign news, may have
been attracted by a telegram
from Amsterdam, stating that
the Minister of Justice has
issued an order prohibiting
the pigeon-shooting matches
which were to have been held
the other day on the Rusten-
burg estate. Why cannot Sir
William Habcourt likewise
issue an order prohibiting the
pigeon-shooting matches which
are held at Hurlingham?
This is no fool's question;
for the Home Secretary has
power to withhold permission
to perform experiments on
living animals from scientific
men, and it has been stated,
as yet without contradiction,
that he has actually refused
vivisection certificates to seve-
ral eminent physiologists.
How inscrutable is the wisdom
of the law which empowers
him to hinder investigators
from wounding rabbits or
guinea-pigs, even for the
advancement of medicine and
surgery, but not to forbid
idlers from shooting, crip-
pling, maiming, and mangling
doves, of which the pigeon-
shooter stands charged at the
bar of publio opinion with
causing the eyes to be gouged
out previously, for fun! This
consistency must be conspicu-
ous to everybody outside of

gible for admission to that

8HAKSPEARE AND SHOP.
Mb. Punch,
Are yon quite sure,
Sir, that Mr. Dutton Cook is
exact in saying that "in
Shakspeare's time the Actors
knew nothing of Benefits P"
How goes the song in As You
Like It f—
"Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
Thou dot not bite so nigh
As Benefits forgot."
From the above showing,
would it not rather seem that
the Actors, whom Shakspeark
represented in the way of
business, did indeed know
something of Benefits, but
something too little, and much
leBS than they wished to know.
Perhaps Shakspeare, who
speaks so touchingly of _" be-
netits forgot," wished to signify
that he would like to nave
them remembered by the pa-
trons of the Drama; thus
delicately inviting them to
"remember the poor Player."
Doesn't this conjecture sug-
gest an association of ideas
rather opportune just now
a propos of Egyptian and
Turkish requirements—Bene-
fits and Backsheesh?
Yours truly,
Commentator.
FROM THE WELSH HARP.
The Grand Old Minstrel
Boy will not (it is feared)
preside with harp and voice
at the Eisteddfod. But if
the Harpists want an ex-
tra'Lyre—and a good big
'un too—here's a chanoe for
the ex-War Correspondent of
a certain, or recently uncer-
tain Daily Paper I
in the way of "paper." The storm is short and partial, and not
sufficiently severe to account for the absolutely deserted appear-
ance of Piccadilly and Regent Street between eleven and half-past
twelve at night. The Middlesex Magistrates will be delighted, and
the "C" Division despondent. The second and concluding Tableau
is the conventional fire, with its accompanying smoke and confusion.
As well as could be made out through the haze, before the Curtain
finally fell, all the bad people had killed one another, and the hero
and heroine had made arrangements for immediate marriage.
Fun on the Bristol at the Olympic. What this exactly is, it is
difficult to say. Suppose an entertainment written by Mr. Dick
(David Copperfield's ,l Mr. Dick ") for the Colney Hatch Christy
Minstrels, and supposing farther that Mr. Dick had carefully
studied all previous Ethiopian serenader literature, the libretti of the
entertainment of Messrs. Maskelyne and Cook, and the dialogues
of Ventriloquists with the man up the gas-pipe, or with the drunken
person in the cellar, and suppose a struggle on Mr. Dick't part to
keep some sort of a story in it, and to introduce " illustrations"
of the oldest German-Reed-Entertainment type,—well imagine
these being mixed all together anyhow, and some faint notion may
be obtained of what this three-act " Oddity " is like.
There is a broad Comedian there, however, one Mr. Sheridan,
with a strong facial resemblance to the late Mr. Georoe Honey,
who, if he can do anything out of Irish brogue parts, ought to be an
acquisition to any company; and, if his line is entirely Irish, he
could revive the old style of farce formerly associated with the name
of Power and Hudson. His make-up as'the vulgar middle-aged
Irish-American Widow, with a great deal to say and do, and his
make-up as the Old Jew, with nothing to say and hardly anything
to do, were both good,—the latter especially so.

BOLNEY FEBBY.
The way was long, the sun was high,
The Minstrel was fatigued and dry!
From Wargrave he came walking down,
In hope to soon reach Henley town;
And at the " Lion " find repast,
To slake his thirst and break his fast.
Alas! There's neither punt nor wherry
To take him over Bolney Ferry!
He gazes to the left and right—
No craft is anywhere in sight,
Except the horse-boat he espied
Secure upon the other side;
No skiff he finds to stem the swirl,
No ferryman, nor boy, nor girl!
He sits and sings there'' Hey down derry!"
But can't get over Bolney Ferry!
No ferry-girl? Indeed I 'm wrong,
For she—the subjeot of my song—
So dainty, dimpled, young, and fair,
Is coolly sketching over there.
She gazes, stops, then seems to guess
The reason of the Bard's distress.
A brindled bull-dog she calls "Jerry,"
Comes with her over Bolney Ferry!
She pulls, and then she pulls again.
With shapely hands, the rusty chain;
She smiles, and, with a softened frown,
She bids her faithful dog lie down.
As she approaches near the shore
She shows her dimples more and more.
Her short white teeth, lips like a cherry
UnpoutiDg show, at Bolney Ferry!

She chirps and chatters, and the twain
Together pull the rusty chain:

But brings him nearer to the bank!

And so they part at Bolney Ferry I

A HANDBOOK OF KNOWLEDGE.
No. VIII.—The Coffee-Shop.
Q. "What is a Coffee-Shop?
A. The opprobrium of the London
thoroughfares.
Q. May I ask you to particularise a
little?
A. It is difficult in a few words to
define so curious a combination of many
nastinesses as the London Coffee-Shop.
It can only be described, and that in
considerable detail.
Q. Is it not, as its name implies, a
shop for the sale of Coffee?
A. That would, in most cases, be an imperfect and misleading
definition. Firstly, because most Coffee-Shops sell other things
than Coffee. Secondly, and most importantly, because most Coffee-
Shops do not sell Coffee at all.
Q. But does not this singular carrying out of the lucus a non
lucendn principle lead to difficulties with would-be customers?
A. Not at all.
Q. How, then, do the keepers of Coffee-Houses avoid such diffi-
culties?
A. By substituting various dirty and dismal decootions which
they vend under the name of the genuine produce of Mocha.
Q. How are these decoctions composed?
A. Of ingredients as numerous, and often as unpleasant, as the
constituents of the Witches' broth in Macbeth, among the more
innocent of which are ohicory, horse-beans, and iig-ref use.
Q By what devices are these decoctions rendered palatable to the
purchaser?
A. They are not rendered palatable at all. On the oontrary, the
muddy and tepid draught from the clumsy and unolean Coffee-
House oup is as unpleasant to all the senses as can well be imagined.
Q. Are, then, the Coffee-Shops of London little used?
A. On the contrary, they are largely patronised by the lower and
even the middle classes. The Coffee-House is, indeed, in many
oases the restaurant of poor respectability, and to no small extent
the home of suoh persons as labourers, oabmen, and the poorer grades
of shopmen and clerks.
Q. What appearance do these curiously-conduoted shops present P
A. Externally they are generally characterised by a sort of surface
smartness, so far as this can be produced by paint, French-polish,
gold-lettering, and gleaming lamps. Internally they are almost in-
variably frowsy, foetid, and fly-blown. Particularly the latter;
the Coffee-House fly being an insect which, for plentifulness and
pertinacity, surpasses even his fellows of the Butcher's or Confec-
tioner's Shop.
Q. Will you describe the average Coffee-House interior a little
more in detail?
A. In entering it, you probably plunge down an unseen and
treacherous step, or steps, into a dingy, stall-divided, low-ceiling'd
apartment, with an aspect of misty gloom, and an atmosphere of
steamy unsavouriness. The "stalls," consisting of narrow tables
and hard seats, are of wood, grimy mahogany, or grubby sham-oak,
the whole confined, unolean, and dismally unoomfortable. If there
be any cloth at all uuon the table, it is invariably smutty and egg-
stained into a sort of Whistlerian arrangement in soot and gamboge.
Most commonly there is no cloth at all, but the grease-coated and
coffee-ringed board is left bare to sight and to touch. The ceiling is
low and smoke-darkened exceedingly; the walls are steamy, and
decorated with hat-pegs and battered advertisements. The murky
air of the apartment is resonant with a dull, yet fretful and irritating
booming. It is the oo-operative buzzing of myriads of flies, whose
bodies, or whose traces are on and over everything, ceilings, walls,
clumsy oups and saucers, the mysterious decoctions served therein,
the coarse sugar in the shattered glass bowl, the dirty milk in the
dirtier mug, the rickety cruet-stand, and the odd and fractured
castors, the greasy bread-and-butter, and the equivocal egg.
Q. And what are the attendants upon the unhappy customer in
this dreary den P
A. Commonly depressed men in shirt-sleeves and aprons, or blowsy
and bare-armed women in caps or curl-papers, who have to be sum-
moned from dim and mystio interiors, by rapping on the table with
a " copper " or a cup-bottom.
Q. What about the edibles and potables sold in these places?
A. They are generally quite in keeping with the places and their
appointments; that is to say, they are nasty without necessarily
being cheap. The—so-called—Coffee I have already described. It
is a dreadful draught, served up in dirty crockery, accompanied by
huge slabs of brown-crusted bread smeared with a yellow deposit of
oily butter. Tea, too, is forthcoming upon call,—a long-stewed,
dingy-tinted potion of uncertain origin, flat as stale soda-water,
nauseous as a sarsaparilla drench. Eggs which are musty, bacon
which is rusty, steaks whieh are tough, and chops which are tainted,
even sodden cuts from half-cooked joints, and wedges of flabby
pastry, may be procured at the more pretentions Coffee-Houses,
while at the humbler ones the sense is regaled with the strong
savour of red-herrings and smoked haddocks.
Q. You say that certain classes of the community freely patronise
these dismal houses of entertainment?
A. They are the only resource of persons who will not stoop to the
Cookshop and cannot rise to the Restaurant or Hotel.
Q. Would not clean, comfortable, and fairly cheap Coffee-Houses
be a boon to these multitudes P ./. Assuredly.
Q. What are the obstacles in the way of their establishment P
A. The same that militate against all improvements whatever—
self-interest and stupidity; especially, in this case, the latter. Bright
and cleanly Coffee-Rooms, where people, seated in comfort, could
obtain wholesome refreshment at reasonable rates, would brighten
the daily lives of large sections of the public, plump the pockets of
enterprising caterers, and be no inconsiderable auxiliaries to the
cause of Temperance.
Q. Have no efforts been made in this direction P
A. Yes; mostly ill-directed, and not generally successful.
Q. Why is this?
A. Mainly from want of sympathy and imagination.
Q. Are these commonly regarded as the qualities essential to
success in so praotical a matter?
./. No. They are generally looked upon, and laughed at, as mere
Soetical equipments. They are nevertheless prime necessities in
ealing on a large scale with the wants of the poorer commonalty.
Q. Will you explain your seemingly transcendental position?
A. It needs wide and intimate sympathy to realise the require-
ments of the great, varied but unvocal throng of what may be called the
Hand-to-Mouth classes. It needs imagination and inventive enter-
prise to devise that which will meet at once their necessities and
their tastes. Caterers for the convenience and the amusement of
these classes, who possessed in the requisite degree these qualities,
would go far to transform Society. They would at least provide,
what at present are nearly non-existent, places where common
people could partake of common fare in common comfort, amidst
surroundings whioh were commonly cheerful, and at rates which
were commonly cheap.

A SONG OF SOBRIETY.
"Tbmperancb in South London.—The Southwark Total
Abstinence Union on Sunday commenced ' a week of 100 meet-
ings' by four large demonstrations in different part* of the
borough. At Bermondsey Square, St. George's Circus, Millpond
Bridge, and the East London Railway Station, large numbers
assembled, with banners and regalia from the several temperance
organisations in the distriots."—Morning Paper.
At the next merry meeting of the Southwark Total
Abstainers, their proceedings will, perhaps, be addition-
ally enlivened if some capable Vooalist can be procured
to sing them a song which may be entitled—
THE MODERATE DRINKER.
He that always gets drunk every night of his life,
Goeshabed the worse, most nights, for liquor.
When his duty 'sh to love and oherish his wife,
He's acoussomed to thrash her and kick her.
Did you ever hear talk of Chrislophero Sly f
A tippler he was—and a tinker.
I don't hold with sish characters, I don't, not I;
But I '11 own I 'm a Moderate Drinker.
When a Total Abstainer refuses his glass,
Overoomin' a strong inclination,
I won't shay that I look on that man as an ass,
'Cause he knows that he can't shtand temptation.
But no weakness like that is a trouble to me;
So I 'm neither a sot nor a slinker;
And I won't take the pledge, but I 'll keep my will free
To indulge as a Moderate Drinker.
Some I know in a senseless incapable shtate,
That get sometimes wheeled home in a barrow,
I walk shtraight up-stairB always—no matter how late—
"*If I don't always rise with the sparrow.
Now and then I 've a twinge in one tender great toe;
An' I 'm told my noBe keeps growing pinker;
But how many Teetotallers likewise look so,
Just the same as a Moderate Drinker.
'Tisn't drink of a morning that makes my head ache,
For till noon I take nothing that's heady,
Only when my hand happens a little to shake.
And a drop sherves the shinnewsh to shteady.
'Tis exoess that makes topers talk thick and look queer,
Now I shpeak like a rational thinker,
As you all must allow, 'cause you see and you hear
That I 'm only a Moderate Drinker.
CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS A NEW ANGLO-
TURKISH DICTIONARY OF DIPLOMACY.
With Annotations and Illustrations.
Br Kibosh Pasha.
Diplomacy. The art of lying with dignity, evading with polite-
ness, delaying with decorum, and financing with finesse. (See Arts.
Lie, Evasion, Delay, Bribe.)
Lie. The " Rahat Lakhoum " of Diplomacy, or Truth in the form
of a Confection (Anglice, "Real Jam ). Some (Oriental) lexico-
graphers invert this, and define Truth as a " Confection of Lies,"
Falsehood " sweetened to taste," as the Cookery-Books of the West
have it. It is a distinction without a difference. There is no differ-
ence—in the diplomatic sense. What is called "Truth" is the
(apparent) form in which a Lie is most palatable to the punctilious
Western taste. In that form, therefore, it is the duty of the
obliging Oriental to present it. The obliging Oriental invariably
does his duty in this respect.
Evasion. The art of not kicking against the pricks. Points—
whether of weapons or arguments—are generally prickly. Both
should be avoided as long as possible.
Delay. Time, says the wise man, waits for no one. It is the
business of the wise man, therefore, to wait for Time. Time gene-
rally brings everything to those who wait for him. Delay is merely
waiting for Time. The Western mind is hasty. It objects to
waiting for Time, or, what is the same thing, for the Turk. Except
that the Turk brings nothing to those who wait for him.
Procrastination. The more active form of delay. The West
says that "Procrastination is the thief of Time." it is rather its
murderer. The more time you kill—in diplomacy—the better.
Negotiation. The art of postponing the acceptance of an unplea-
sant proposition by the counter-suggestion of an impracticable one.
Consideration. Looking at nothing with your eyes shut. An
excellent occupation for the interval between receiving the un-
pleasant proposition and making the impracticable one. (See above.)
Intrigue. See Diplomacy.
Corbuption. The finance of Diplomacy. The art of_ buying
(your enemies) in the oheapest market, and selling (your friends) in
the dearest. The latter branch of the art is the more pleasant and
profitable. Some experts even suooeed in oombining the two opera-
tions in one transaction. This is the perfection of the art.
Bribe. The circulating medium of diplomatic finance. The
standard coinage of the political currency. The bribe (backsheesh)
is indeed the substantial and fundamental basis of all diplomatic
transactions, which consist, au fond, in giving or receiving bribes.
It is more blessed to receive than to give—a bribe. But there is one
thing more blessed still. It is to receive a bribe, and "evade"
(q. v.) the briber. This is selling the buyer. Sometimes—in-
artistioally—called swindling. It is the finesse of diplomatic finance,
to which, in its perfection, the crude and clumsy Western mind
never attains. The true Turk—Allah be praised!—can buy without
paying the purchase-money, and sell without parting with the com-
modity sold. This is the real diplomacy.
Ultimatum. The Western notion of Kismet or the Inevitable.
To the Eastern understanding, a cul-de-sac with a back-door to it.
That point in negotiations which affords the finest opportunity for
lying, evading, delaying, considering, bribing, in short, for all the
processes of diplomacy. The Inevitable—in the Turkish sense—is
Diplomacy's last ditch, driven to which, the Turk has yet one
resource, viz., to lie down in it gracefully, as though he liked it. He
always avails himself of this resource.
The new pieoe, CISture, an adaptation from the French, by W. E.
Gladstone, will be read to the Company at T. R., St. Steph: 'e,
Westminster, as soon as possible after the re-assembling of the
Company in October. The pieoe is described as possessing very little
literary merit, but as offering fine opportunities for " gagging."

TORY REVELS.
{Slightly altered from Tennyson.)
"Conservative Demonstrations," held at the country seats of the NoMc-
men and Gentlemen of the "Constitutional Party," have been of frequent
occurrence lately. On Monday the Marquis of Smallbeeksbtj&y opened
the splendid grounds of Hat«off Park to a select party of about eleven thou-
sand five hundred Conservative Working Men, their wives and families, who
were regaled with a substantial cold collation, followed by a variety of out-
door sports, including Ethiopian minstrelsy, racing in sacks, kiss-in-the-ring,
and dancing on the green. Several moat eloquent speeches, extending over
more than three hours and a quarter, and in which the Home, Irish, and
Foreign policy of the Liberal (}•) Government was unhesitatingly condemned,
were delivered by the distinguished Statesmen present. The enthusiasm of
the audience was tremendou-; and it was touching to mark the staunch
adherence to Conservative principles (and toffy) shown by mere infants. On
Tuesday the Earl of Stoptheway entertained the Members of the Dragbe-
hind Conservative Horny-handed Sons of Toil Club, with their President
the Hon Lilywhitb Paws, MP, at his fine old ancestral seat, Blockington
Hall, Mouldy Huist. The entertainments included a capital meal, &c.
Mind man's buff, lawn-tonnis, bumblepuppy, coddams, and Tonic Sol-Fa
singing, followed by some most stirring displays of oratory from the distin-
guished Statesmen present, and in which the Foreign, Irish, and Home
policy of the so-called Liberal Administration was unhesitatingly denounced.
1 he proceedings (which were throughout of a most enthusiastio character)
wound up with a brilliant display of fireworks.—On Saturday next it is
announced that & fete champelre will be given at Tolloddle Place, near
8assidgebury, Epping, the picturesque seat of Sir Gyrus Tolloddle, Bart.
The Members of the Anti-Bili-of-Bights Association, the Keturn-to-Rotten-
Borougha League, and the Society for the Total Suppression of the Habeas
Corpus, will be present in force; and it is expected that resolutions scathingly
condemnatory of the Home and Foreign policy of a psoudo-Liberal Govern-
ment, will be moved and seconded by the distinguished Statesmen who hare
promised to attend. The pyrotechnic arrangements have been entrusted to
the well-known firm of Blazer and Blowemut, Lower Explosion Road, 8. E.
—Morning Bedpost.
Sib Gypes Tolloddle, all an Autumn day,
Gave his broad, breezy lands, till set of sun,
Up to the Tories. Thither flocked at noon
His helots, wife and child; and thither half
The neighb'ring pooket-borough, "pubs" and all,
Of which he was the Patron. I was there,
From Fleet Street visiting, the son of Punch;
And Toby too, with others of our set,
Together six, met at Tolloddle Place.
And me that morn the Bart, did show the house,
Rum, very rum, and full of rum old things,
All Tory. All the flowers were True Blue,
The proper colour of Conservatives; _
CarvM stones of Grampound's ruins in the park,
Old Sarum's wall, and Gatton's franchise lost;
And on the tables musty vestiges
Of Tory rule were jumbled all together—
Gags, handcuffs, gyves, and busts of Castlereaoh,
Dark lanterns, ex officio informations,
Stocks, whipping-posts, and ancient cats-o'-nine-tails,
Th' accursed ballot-box and voting ticket,
The last Pot Walloper's revered skull,
The bones of voters who paid scot and lot.
And the halforowns which they were paid for voting.
I went
(Nursing a Blue-Book on Election Bribes)
Down through the park: glad was the sight to see,
For all the sloping pasture murmur'd full
Of happy faoes very red with beer.
There moved the multitude, a thousand heads.
The artful leaders of their Institute
Taught them with flams. One mix'd a bowl with soap-
And-water, and from 'bacoo-pipe did blow
The lying Tory bubble of the moment,
"Unprofitably Gay"; and, lower down,
A man with knobs and wires sent
A bogus message. Echo, in her Bleep,
Cried '' Telegraph!" And here were telescopes
That plainly showed green cheese within the moon.
A clock-work steamer, mann'd by Radicals,
Paddled along, and all at once blew up.
A dozen Tory spouters jetted steam:
A petty railway ran—and off the rails
Ran half the train, through a Fourth Party's means.
A puppet Gban villk, in a parachute,
Soar'd high, collapsed, and tumbled on his nose.
How the mob roared! An image made like Dilke,
But which, in truth, was but a Chelsea Bun,
"Was sacrificed with solemn ritual to
The Eleusinian Mysteries, and then
The children ate him.
Wolff, Gobst, and Warton, with their faces b'ack'd
With smut of muoh incinerated cork.
With Welsh wigs dyed in ink like Ethiops' wool,
And collars looming large like schooners' sails,
Sang a Conservative and comic lay—
Its burden, "We 're a Merry Family,
We are! we are!" And then an antic man,
Straw in his hair, and fury in his eye,
Full tilt at windmills with a goo?equill ran,
And mopp'd and mow'd, and said he was St. James,
That yonder was the War Traill from Pall Mall;
And, if these things were done in Greenwood, what
Should next be done in dry? Blest raver! Then
A brave Aunt-Sallv image was set up,
To represent the "People's William's" phiz;
And then, with yells of " Yah!" from myriad throats,
They made a cockshy of the Grand Old Man.
An ox, that had a mask like Harcourt's mug,
Was roasted whole, and Northcote basted it,
And revelled in the gravy ; so that grub
Went hand in hand with sport, and beer with both.
Elsewhere there was pure sport- Peers raced in sacks;
While through horse-collars M.P.'s gaily grinned
For phantom Lordships of the Treasury,
The while a bearded Marquis grimly shinn'd
A parlous passage up a greasy pole,
But soon slipped down again, and could not clutch
The much-loved leg of mutton fat, called " Plaoe."
And then they talked. Good gracious, how they talked I
And how ten thousand Tory urchins shrieked

crafty and interested Managers, and who are " got at" and bought

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

Theatre-Royal,
Strpbkn's, will Re-Open for short Autumnal Season October 24th, when the new Fieoe,
unavoidably postponed since february, will be put into active preparation.
Cloture,"
Monday night, August 14.—One of those evenings which make the
Aquarium of no account, and utterly falsify the proverb from the
ancientSagas aboutRosherville beingtheplace to spend a happy day in.
"For my part, Toby," says Gregory, "I am a little fastidious
about my enjoyments. Have made a study of pleasure for some
years, whence, perhaps, I acquire my jovial appearance. You may
take your operas, your theatres, your garden-parties, your shooting,
your fishing, or even your goings-up in a balloon. Give me the
House of Commons, meeting in August when the Indian Budget
is on, and Lord Hartinoton is making the statement."
Mr. Gregory rushed into the House so as not to miss a minute of
the fun. Noticed that Hinde Palmer was also early in his
place just behind the Treasury Bench. Quite agree with Gregory.
Really is enough to raise one's spirits at the end of a hard Session to
see Gregory to the left of the Speaker, Hinde Palmer to the right,
and in the middle distance Hartinoton on his feet entering into
minute details of Indian Finance.
Exhilaration completed by what followed. The Members who
discuss Indian affairs do not stand absolutely in the front ranks of
Parliamentary attraotiveness. Still, one may spend a pleasant
evening, especially if it's hot, with Sir George Campbell, Sir
George Balfour, Mr. Alderman Fowler, Sir Walter Barttelot,
Mr. O'Donnell, and Mr. Arthur Arnold,
A little disturbing to the repose that Bteeps mind and body on
these occasions is the marvel at the range of talent of latter
personage. Some men of long standing in the House are content to
be authorities on one subject, or even two. Some are well up on the
Land question, others on India, others on Ireland; some think
Foreign Politics wide enough for their range; others lend their
powerful minds to discussion, in Committee of Supply; whilst others,
like Mr. Trevelyan for example before he joined the Ministry, take
a single subject like the assimilation of the Borough and County
Franchise, make it their own, and hammer away at it till it is in
shape for legislation. One of Arthur's earliest Parliamentary feate
was, without saying by your leave, to appropriate Trevelyan's
Motion, regardless of the circumstance that the Government had
already adopted it as their own. In addition, he is at home on all
subjects named above, and many more.
"Wonderful man, Arnold," I said to Gladstone, as we went
down in a 'bus together to the East End, where, in preparation for
his cruise. Weo was going to get a nautical suit at a shop in White-
chapel, which he 'd heard highly spoken of. "Quite the Admirable
Crichton of the House of Commons. Knows everything."
"All things but one," said Wsa, looking down at me over the'edge
of his collar, as one might gaze at a remote object over the verge of
a precipice. "He doesn't Know the House of Commons."
Business done,—Indian Budget brought in.
Tuesday Night,—Irishmen gone over to Dublin to revel in the
splendid eloquence of Lord Mayor Dawson at unveiling of
O'Connell's monument. Mr. Callan left behind to represent the
gentleness and the genius of Ireland. Rose to the height of occa-
sion. Began by moving Adjournment of House at question-time,
whilst he oharged some of his countrymen, holding ofhcial positions
in Ireland, with heinous crimes. Attorney-General showed there
was not slightest foundation for allegations. Nevertheless, some
hours later, Mr. Callan turned up again. What with heat of the
weather, and weight of responsibility, as sole representative of
Ireland, seemed to nave forgotten what had taken place earlier in the
evening. Made his speech over again, and then promised to deliver
it again the 'next day. Sir William Harcourt, out of sympathy
with patriotio sentiments perhaps a little incoherently expressed,
came down heavy on the Member for Louth, who politely retorted
by giving him the lie direct. Lyon Playfair lingered long round
the representative for Ireland, offering him repeated opportunities
to withdraw. Callan firm. Not going to waste an opportunity, or
lose a leaf of his laurels. In the end suspended, after an inter-
ruption of publio business whioh, from first to last, covered an hour
and a half. Mr. Callan highly gratified. Will go back to Ireland
oovered with glory.
"Thim fellows thought they were doin' a foine thing in goin' to
Dublin, and showing thimselves beside O'Connell. Thought they 'd
left Philip Callan in the lurch, bad cess to 'em! But I 've bate
thim now, and no harm done till I get suspended the third time, and
begorra I '11 lave that over till the Last day but two of the Autumn
Session, when I '11 ask the Sparer to oblige me agin. They think
they 're a foine clever lot here. But Phil Callan twists them round
his finger as aisy as if they was a bit of soap, and," he added, reflec-
tively calling to mind the advantage of more constant practice,
".aisier." There's a good deal in what Mr. Callan says.
Asiimead Arabi Bartlett Bey had a fine field night. Delivered
luminous address on Foreign Policy, in hearing of six Members.
Stafford Northcote may shirk his duty, Drummond Wolff may
cut away before the end of the Session, and Lord Elcho may steal a
march by moving Adjournment of the House, so that he can get off
his speech, and then get off himself. "If other boroughs fail at the
crisis, Eye won't," says Ashmead, who hath a gentle wit.
Business done.—Mr. Callan expelled from another Club.
Wednesday,—Great disappointment in sixty noble breasts. Gene-
rally understood that everybody's gone out of town. House does
not adjourn till Friday: but after Session of the kind we 've had,
natural disposition on the part of Members to clear out. Occurred
to sixty Members that here was a chance of immortality. A bril-
liant picture rises before heated imagination. Everybody away
except him. Enters House; takes his seat. Only .Sergeant-at-
Arms and Clerk at table at present. Sergeant-at-Arms stands at
entrance, looking across deserted Lobby. Nobody else comes. Pre-
sently walks up-stairs. Patrols Committee-Room with drawn
sword. Pokes with brand under tables, chairs, and in cupboards
where Members not desiring to make a House are accustomed to
lurk. Comes down, and finds the one Member in his place, waiting
to say his prayers. No House, no prayers. No Speaker, no Motion

having said what you wanted, offering to withdraw. No fun, no
nothing. Only this one Member, faithful among the faithless found.
Sir Ch arles Forster was one of the sixty, and as he put his hat on
at home preparatory to losing it at the House, he pictured himself
sitting lonely and in full possession of the House. "Like Cassa
What s-his-name," he said to himself; "the boy who stood on the
quarter-deck where all but he were burned."
Perfectly disgusted on arriving at House to find that same
idea had occurred to fifty-nine others. Evidently no use to
stop. So one by one disgusted Members retired, and. House dwindled
down till at half-past four Counted Out.
Business done.—Appropriation Bill sent up to Upper House.
Thursday.—Ireland broken out in fresh place. Mr. Gray has been
breaking the law, and been punished for it. Extraordinary excitement
and indignation at this remarkable concurrence of events. Six Land-

"Dash my wig, but I "11 hare no more Gray airs!" exclaimed Justice Lawaon,

Leaguers told off to hurry back to Westminster and protest against the
unheard-off procedure. All very well for law-breakers in England
to be punished; but in Ireland not used to it and won't have it.
Considering'the shock received by public mind in Ireland, pro-
ceedings went off with unexpected quietude, or would have done only
for Mr. Callan. Philip's feelings overcame him again, and, to his
great surprise, was always running up against the Speaker or some
other authority. Whatever he does is wrong. He cheers his friend
Sexton, and Sexton angrily rebukes him. He bellows at the
Attorney-General, and the Speaker threatens direful conse-
quences. So Philip goes to sleep. But even here liberty of subject
interfered with. When he sleeps he snores. Not an ordinary snore,
but an effort such as a full-sized over-fed porker might make on
discovering that when he thought he 'd been going the wrong way,
he 'd been artfully led on a right path. Speaker looked threaten-
ing. Sergeant-at-Arms sat at attention I Another snore, and all
would be lost. The O'Kklly equal to the occasion. Executing a
forced march, he came up to the
bench over which Philip's head
gracefully hung, and, by dexterously
pulling his hair, kept him just awake
enough not to snore, and not so wide
awake as to contradict.
Did very well up to last moment,
when, Speaker about to put Reso-
lution, a too vigorous tug at his back
hair, brought Philip to his feet; in
which position he contrived to stand
till he 'd compelled adjournment of

Strangers in Gallery much edified.

to begin again as soon as the Speak er
came back from the Lords. But
would not have it, and whilst Joey B.
was thinking how it would be 'if he moved the adjournment, the
House was adjourned till 24th of October. Till then, as far as this
Diary is concerned, the great question started by Shakespeare,
"Toby, or not to be P" is gently but firmly settled in the negative.
FABLES REVERSED.
No. IV.—The Hare and the Tortoise.
In days of yore, by which I mean
A thousand things since then have been,
The Tortoise started on a race,
But moved at such a tedious pace
That his competitor, the Hare,
Running here, there, and everywhere,
Would often tarry by the way,
Sure, when he pleased, to win the day;
But not disposed to miss the chance
Of seeing points of interest.
So here he took his winter rest,
And there in summer made pleasaunce.
The Tortoise still, with heart and soul,
Thought only of the distant goal.
Footsore and sad this sort of Toad
Crept wearily along the road.
The Hare could always catch him up
But every eve
To dine took leave
And halted every night to sup.
Conclusion and Moral.
The Tortoise won the raoe—by half a head I
But what a miserable life he d led I

THE SPENDTHRIFT'S GUIDE.—No. V.
Ingenuity in spending or wasting money will grow by what it
feeds on, and the Spendthrift will feel a lofty contempt for the poor
plodders in outlay who keep yachts, breed race-horses, and fatten
prize oattle. He will aim at a higher mark, and as long as he shoots
with golden bullets, will find no difficulty in hitting it.
If there is one thing more than another that can be bought at a
certain price in the open market, it is a seat in Parliament. When
a seat is bought, it by no means follows that the buyer is obliged to
sit in it. He can appoint a deputy. If he can buy one seat, he can
buy ten; and if he can buy ten, he can buy twenty, with the usual
trading reduction on taking a quantity. If he can appoint one
deputy, he can appoint twenty, and can thus become the sole lessee
and manager of a compact Parliamentary party. There is nothing
to prevent him calling it the Sixth Party. The Fourth Party is a
copyright term, and the right of translation is reserved; and the
term Fifth Party is more or less claimed by Messrs. Co w en, Goschen,
and Co.—the champion jibbers of St. Stephen's.
In arranging his plans he may calculate his expenses to a shilling.
An average seat in Parliament costs between four and five thousand
pounds sterling, and the cost of keeping it up may vary from three
hundred to a thousand a year. Five thousand pounds is a fair sum
to pay for each Member for one year's lease, or one hundred thousand
pounds for twenty Members. This will inolude all charges—even
the fees for twenty elections at the Reform Club. The annual
allowance to the twenty Members—as in the case of the Irish Party
is a matter of arrangement.
In selecting his Members, the Spendthrift need consult no Party,
and no prejudices. He may keep up appearanoea by giving every
"interest" an apparent ohance, on the distinct understanding that
all voting is to be under his sole direction. He can have a '' godless''
Member, with a good digestion for Mumbo-Jumbo tests, and be can
balance this representative with a serious Member—one of the pets
of the Reform Club—whose notion of liberty is the liberty of think-
ing exactly as the serious Member thinks. He can have a Cabman to
represent the Cab interest, and an ex-Prize-fighter to uphold the
principles of peace on earth and good-will amongst men. He can
have an unconvicted Member of the criminal classes to watch the
legislation which is supposed to restrict and punish the spread of
crime; and he can have a Publican to keep an eye on licensing
restrictions. He can have an Acrobat to watch all Acts of Parlia-
ment limiting the freedom of athletic sports; and he can balance
this with a milksop Member who is inclined to place every dangerous
crossing under the parental care of Government.
He can have a waspish Member with a head for figures, who will
fill the place so long left vacant by the late Joseph Hume, and he
can have several vestrymen well trained to expose the waste and
incompetency of Bumbledom. A sonorous speaker against time, who
is never at a loss for words, and never hampered with ideas, an
impecunious Lord to take the Chair at Public Meetings, and a well-
to-do Actor to give a conservative tone and an appearance of
respectability to the whole combination, will make the Sixth Party
one of the most complete things in Parliament. The Spendthrift, in
exchange for his money, will become a power in the. State, and will
rank with Gin, Beer, and Railways in the Councils of the Nation.

I had passed through a Session Satanic,
And Irish, with "Pussy," sleek Peer.
Those were the days of explosion volcanio,
The nights of delirium drear.
Long speeches, and labours Titanio,
Pat outrage, Egyptian panic,
Rude ruction, Obstruction, and fear,
French shirking, and shyness Germanic—
A most unforgettable year I
The Session, in fact, was a twister,
Had filled us with doubt and with gloom;
But we 'd got to the end of its vista,*
For starry-eyed Hope there seemed room.
We could flee from Big Ben's heavy boom.
Yet Forecast, Hope's heavy-browed sister,
Kept whispering words of dark doom
In my ear, "You'll resume! You'll
resume I
In two months from to-day, you '11
resume I"
"We are off I" Pussy cried. "This it
pleasant I
How jolly! From Westminster far!"
"Ah, precisely," said I, "for the present!"
Cried he, "What a croaker you are I
What a—well Grand old Croaker you are!
Let us think of the grouse and the pheasant,
And not of St. Stephen's war.
Of popping at partridge and pheasant,
Not worry, and Warton, and war."
Then I said, "My dear Pussy, be sober!
Remember we re bound to be here
By the end of the month of October,
Of this unforgettable year—
By the twenty-fourth day of October.
This very identioal year.
Ha! doesn't that make you feel queer?"
"We shall yet have to work, Puss, like
winking.
Tourists? C/o<ur«-ists also I trust.
Obstruction to fight without shrinking
Will call us all baok— come we must,
To St. Stephens's shindy and dust."
"Oh, hang it!" cried Puss, his faoe sinking;
"That bothering Cloture be—bust 1"
Then I pacified Pussy, and chid him
For giving vulgarity room.
And he promised to do as I bid him,
But there passed o'er his features a
gloom—
A settled and sable-hued gloom—
As black as the pall o'er a tomb.
And I said—of it hoping to rid him—
"Dear Puss, what's the cause of this
gloom?"
He replied, "You '11 resume I You '11
resume!
'Tis the thought of those words, You'll
resume!"

THE CENSOR OF THE PRESS IN EGYPT.
(A Sketch from Two Points of View.)
THE HEROIC IDEA-MORE OR LESS IDEAL.
Scene—A Battle-field. The Censor is discovered charging the enemy, rallying
a British square, and superintending the erection of fortifications.
Censor. So far, so good. I have a moment's rest. Nay, a British regiment
advances. I must address them. (Enter Battalion—he declaims for a quarter-
of-an-hour. Battalion cheer, and exeunt.) Ah, who comes here r
Special Correspondent (entering on foam-covered horse). 'Tis I! Ha, ha!
it has been a hard ride I I have cut down a dozen artillerymen, made short work
of a regiment of cavalry, and here I am! [Bests on drum
Censor. And welcome! Look out, a shell approaches!
[They both bob their heads. The projectile passes over them.
Special Correspondent. And now the news?
Censor. The same as ever. Our troops are as brave as lions; our foes, though
sturdy, cannot stand the rush of British lead and steel. Tell the Public that
England may be proud of her Army, her Navy, and her Volunteers.
Special Correspondent (rather impatiently). Yes, yes, I know! That is
what you said yesterday! But surely you have got something more definite.
Think—is there no scrap of news I can send to my employers with safety?
Censor (emphatically). None. I regret it, but the orders of the Commander-
in-Chief are imperative! See, Sir—the enemy!
[Enter an Egyptian Army. Scene closes in as they fall to.
THE MATTER-OF-FACT IDEA—LESS OR MORE REAL.
Scene-
-An Office. The Censor it discovered arranging his papers, putting his
books in order, and hanging up his maps.
Censor. Come, that's all right. Strange no one 's looked me up. Ah, I
thought so 1 Here's Billy Dawdle. Must have a chat. (Enter Aide-de-
camp. Pleasant conversation for half-an-hour. The Aide-de-camp nods, and
exit.) Some one else?

here. Been challenged by a dozen sentries, but I 've come. [Sinks on sofa.

Censor. The same old story. All right at the front. Fellows as per usual.
Everybody in it—Army, Navy, and "Volunteers. Give
them that kind of thing in your paper. (
Special Correspondent (rather impatiently). Yes, yes.
But that's what I 've been doing for the last fortnight!
What's the good of wiring leading articles? 'Course I
don't want to help Mr. Arabi, but haven't you a scrap
that will do for a Second Edition?
Censor (emphatically). None! Awfully sorry, old
chap, but must obey orders. You know what Sir Gab-
net 's like. See, old man—the luncheon!

fall to.
THE SALVATION NAVY.
The Salvation Army was sure not to exist long without
an imitator, and we are, therefore, not surprised to hear
of a Salvation Navy, under the direction of a person
calling himself Admiral Tug. The Archbishop of Can-
terbury has sent a Post-Office Order for ten shillings,
and a letter of sympathy to the Admiral. Admiral Tuo
has learnt the trick from General Booth of treating the
most sacred things with almost blasphemous familiarity,
and he has summoned his supporters with the following
imitation of the Arethusa sea-song:—
"ON BOARD OF THE "ALLELUJAH!"
Come all you sinners, young and old,
With 'earts once cast in 'Eaven's mould,
And join our Ker-istian Nary bold—
On board of the 'AHelujah!
We 're bound to 8oor the forts of Sin,
And the Devil himBelf will soon cave in,
Then join the side that is sure to win—
On board of the 'Allelujah!
The Queen's English (Letter not admitted by the
Editor of the P.M.O.)—Sir,—Look 'ere, I'm a loyal
subject, I am—by Jingo if I 'm not—and when a pal
reads out to me letters in your paper from people that
come and putemsels forward as crittyscissors of the
Queen's English, it makes my blood bile again, so to
speak, as if Her Majesty didn't speak as good English
as me or you. Then some one notioes, as was also read
out to me, that a weekly crickital paper, when crioke-
sizing others, makes "eight its in five lines." Well,
ain't eight "its" good enough? Nothin' I like more
than avin a good it at anybody or anything as deserves
ittin, and " eight its in five lines " is very fair allowance,

"CHAIRY NOTHINGS."
Table-turning has long ceased
to amuse or interest the British
Public But, if we may judge
from the following advertisement
whioh appears in the Heading
Mercury, there may he consider-
able sport to be had out of chair-
turning.
CHAIR TURNERS.—WANTED,
two good 'Workmen, without
character, either good or bad. No
total abstainer or poacher need apply.
—Address, &c.
As the advertiser requires
neither good nor had character,
possibly indifferent characters
will be at a premium. Thus
there will be a fine opening for
decayed table-turners and spirit-
rappers out of employment. "No
total abstainer or poacher need
apply." We are glad to find that
the advertiser knows where to
draw the line. But why, we
want to know, should chairs be
turned at all? We know the
use of a turnkey, a turncock, a
turnspit, a turnpike, a turncoat,
a turnstile, and a turnover; but
what is the use of a turnchair?
Mr. Punch, who is capable of
turning his own chair when re-
quisite, confesses himself quite
puzzled with this advertisement.
"I am aware, my dear," said
Mrs. Ramsbotham, bridling up,
"that the Poet Laureate is a State
Appointment. But what I want
to know is the meaning of what
Mr. Mum, M.P. for Dumbshire,
told me that some one had accepted
an 'office of Prophet under the
Crown.' How can anyone tell
what's going to happen? and if
he does know, as an official he
oughtn't to tell."

at war with no one," two young Ladies in the next house struck up
the overture to the Crown Diamonds. Then they went in for selec-
tions from Fra Diavolo. Seldom did they play a right note; rarely

What I did for Ireland, I did as a true and as a loyal politician, and
the men of that day who followed me upon the path to which I led
them, were of a different mould and spirit to the wretched crew of
cowards and traitors who, in these later times, have usurped their
heritage and discredited their labour. There are some brave and
honest men still working for Ireland. But, at a time when the Impe-
rial Government has, for a notable effort of just legislation, merited,
the gratitude of your fellow-countrymen, you are compassing the dis-
ruption of the Empire; and with a brazen effrontery you inaugurate
a national enterprise by an avowed insult to your Queen. Such
things were not of my day. On the fifth of December, 1839. when
addressing at Bandon an enthusiastic assemblage of my fellow-
countrymen, I spoke as follows:—" Let every man," I said, "in the
vast and multitudinous assembly stretched out before me, who is
loyal to the Queen, and would defend her to the last, hold up his
right hand I" And to that appeal, as the papers of the time will
tell you, the entire assembly responded with prolonged and tu-
multuous cheering. That was the spirit of those days, and to it was
due the dignity, the durability, and the depth of the mighty agita-
tion of which I was then the centre, and nave since remained the

affeoshun of the Loed Make, as it seems, nearly the whole of
Her.Majesty's Cabinet Ministers, the absenoe of a Dook or two wasn t
of much account. No one was much surprised at the absenoe of Sir
Wixlim Abcourt, after the threts as he has held out to us, and the
langwidge as he has used about us, even his howdaoious imperanee
wasn't equal to beardin the Lion in his Den, speshally about feeding
I have seldom ofishyated at a better dinner, and didn't all the small
fry of the Government thorowly injoy it.
Praps the Evening Noose that the Lords had thrown up the
sponge, and didn't mean to turn 'em all out, gave an adishunal
relish to it.
I am sorry for the poor Markis of Salsbuby. He was alius a
good frend of the Copperashun 'till they wouldn't take his Nevyy
from out of the Brompton Simmetry and make him Rimembransir,
and so, nat'rally feeling this to be rather fishy conduct, he threw
them over at Shad well and left them floundering about like so many
souls and heels. I shouldn't ha much liked to have had to wait on
the nobel Markis when he partook of his umbel reparst on that next
Thursday evening.
But let us return to our "Wittles, as the Frenoh say.
I at once, and without any hezzitashun, pernownce the speeches to be
1st rate. The Lobd Mabe surpast hisself, and that ain't a easy task
for any Lord Mare in August, and for such a Lord Mare as we are
got now, almost impossibel. Nothink but gratitood could a
done it. _..'
"Why, when I heard him say that Heb Majesty's wisdom and
wirtue was almost superhuman, and. bordered on the divine, tho I
didn't know a bit what he ment, I felt quite overcome, and so did a
good many other people, to judge by their looks.
And then the kind way as he spoke of that Mr. Gladstone, and
how he seemed to quite forgive him for fritening them all out of
their wits last Jannewary. Gratitood again, not only for favours
past, but praps for favours to come, says that imperent Brown.
1 suppose the rule holds good with Prime Ministers the same as
with people who are not so prime, "In Wino Werrytas," so it's oon-
solin to learn from him that he has a great respeo for this partiklar
old custom of the City of London. I should rayther think he has.
judging by the way in which he enjoyed hisself, a-chatting and
a-larfing, and a-goin on with his fun with even the Lady Mabess
herself, who with her true good nature didn't seem at all annoyed.
It was werry kind of him to say that tho a man could manage to
do the work of a mere Prime Minister for a serious of years, no man
could stand being a Lord Mare for more than one.
Of course he eluded to Branes, but that imperent Bbown says he
meant Stummick. . , _
Who'd have thort, to look at him a-sipping his Snampain so
daintily, that he had got about 5 millions of discontented Irish
a-setting on one shoulder, so to speak, and Abby B. Passhaw and
sworms of half-naked Ejipshuns on the other. Bbown says it s the
effex of having a clear conscience, but I says it's the effex of having
a fine dijesshun, and if I had my ohice, and could only have one, I
knows which I 'd ohews. _ .
He said a good many siwul things when he drunk the Lobd Mabe s
elth. I was a-lissenin, tho' praps he didn't know it. I didn't
oare, of course, about all his long parlarver about Ejip. I wos
a-waiting ankshuBly to hear him apollygise for what he put m the
Queen's Speech last Janiwerry, and to promise not to do it again,
but, strange to say, he seemed quite to forgit to do so. However,
the Lobd Mabe gave it him rayther hot in his reply, and then they
all broke up and went away.
And bo ends about the 747th Chapter of the strange and ewentfool
history of the grand old Copperation of the City of London, the
nursing Grand-mother of many other Copperations, some Bigger,
like the sillybrated Irish M.P., and some Littler, like the elustrious
Q, C, but aU performing, to the best of their abilities, the two great
duties of Publio Life, Work and Wittles. Should any Frothy M.P.
think of laying his owdacious hands^upon its sacred rites—let
him Paws! ' Robekt.
THE YARN OF THE YACHTSMAN.
"We are at present wobbling about on a thort 'lop' off Ryde Pier."—Log
of the" Eva."
.., I smile at the tempest, I laugh at the

Of the breakers that thunder in foam
on the shore;
I'm calm, when receiving perpetual
shocks
Of ocean, we dance like the gay top-
sail blocks:
But one thing I wish Father Neptune
would stop,
I cannot stand wobbling about on a
"lop."
I sail with the squadron as gay as can be,
I frolio about with the R. T. Y. C.;
I orowd on all sail till the Eva behaves
Like a bibulous dolphin that waltzes in waves:
That suits me, but, oh, for some corner to prop
My poor head, when wobbling about on a' lop.
I 'm quite the gay yaohtsman, and know, Sir, i' fegs,
I 've a real seaman's suit, if 1 've not my sea-legs;
Though I feel that I 'm best down below in a race,
I 'm all there at eight bells when we " splioe the mam-brace;
We anchor, and then I 'm all over the shop,
But preserve me from wobbling about on a' lop.

THE/FIRST OF SEPTEMBER.
The First of September, remember
The day of supremest delight.
Get ready the cartridge, the partridge
Moat fall in the stubble ere night.
The breechloader's ready, and steady
The dog that we taught in old days;
He's firm to his duty, a beauty
That care* for but one person's praise.
He's careful in stubble, no trouble
In turnips, he '■ keen as a man;
But looks on acutely, and mutely
Seems saying, "Shoot well, if you|can'!"
They flash from the cover—what lover
Of sport does not thrill as they rise,
In feathered apparel f Each barrel
Kills one, as the swift covey flies.
So on through the morning, still scorning
All rest until midday has past,
When lunch should be present, and pleasant
That alfresco breaking of fast.
One pipe, then he doing, pursuing
The sport that no sport can eclipse:
So homeward to dinner, a winner
Of praise from the fairest of lips.
EXCHANGE NO ROBBERY.
"And so you have become Naturalised in England, Monsieur Bil-
BOQUET I"
"Hon Dieu, oui, hon Ami I But it do not make much of difference.
I 'ad Lost be Battle of Vatebl6, and now I 'ave Won it! Voila tout!"
Mabvrt I come up !—In consequence of the passing of
the Married Woman's Property Act, it will probably be
found necessary to alter, considerably, some ot the express
conditions mentioned in the Marriage Service. For
richer, for poorer " must be now struck out, and, perhaps,
"for better, for worse " will go with it. "With all my
worldly goods I thee endow"—celava sans dire. Hence-
forward, the wife has her own property to herself, and
the husband his to himself. Self-preservation is the first
law of Nature. But, as we are eoming back to the " first
law of Nature," how far beyond it will the next step
take us?
Sevebal "blue hares" have been shot on the moors.
What a lot Baron A bom klio.uk, Burnamed Blue Beard,
must have had of 'em in his time.
FLIGHTS AND SIGHTS;
OB, A SOME STEPS HT THE WRONG DIRECTION.
The recent controversy with the Dean as to the safety and feasi-
bility of letting batches of five hundred adventurous sightseers at a
time loose among the intricate ladders and dark and dangerous
galleries that lead to the dome of St. Paul's, having spurred the
Working-Men's Committee" to the consideration of further
gymnastic opportunities of a similar description, the following
hitherto unattempted feats will shortly be added to any complete list
of things to be done by intending visitors to the Metropolis:—
Ascent of Iron Flag-staff on the top of Victoria Tower, Westmin-
ster.—May be made daily by parties of not less than twelve, at any
hour from 3 a.m. to 9 p.m. Tickets at Lord Chamberlain's office, the
Lunacy Commissioners, Charing Cross Hospital, and all respectable
licensed victuallers.
Cleopatra's Needle, and Albert Memorial, Hyde Park.—Same
conditions, excepting that for the latter a guide with ice-hatchet and
ropes must be hired at the base. N.B. For the convenience of inex-
perienced climbers, a solicitor, with Forms of Wills ready for
Xature, will be generally found in attendance on foggy or wet
rnoons between 12 and 4. Witnesses, if required, can always
be secured on the spot by payment of a small fee.
The Outside Parapet of Waterloo Bridge.—Free. Intending
visitors over eighty should, in windy weather, get a policeman to
accompany them along the ledge on all-fours and hold them securely
by the hair when turning comers.
Main Drainage System.—Can be inspected at all points, and
descent made immediately on application to any of the local officials.
This should, however, not be attempted after dunk without a map
and Inciters. N.B. There is no cab-stand at Barking.
The Interior of the Chandelier at Drury Lane Theatre.—Through
the roof at any hour. As the above is seen to its best advantage
when lighted, a free admission for two to the Upper Boxes, giving
TTHtrTTT'T
access to a prohibited back stairoase, will be found most conve-
nient. Care should be taken not to drop heavy walking-sticks, rolls
of half-pence, or front-door keys on to the heads of the occupants of
the stalls beneath. Moreover, the chandelier not being capable of
supporting the weight of more than two visitors at a time, it is as
well to arrange with the policeman in pursuit, and offer him a small
consideration to wait in the neck.
The Tigers' Den at the Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park.—Tree
daily. The best hour for entering the above is about twenty
minutes before feeding-time, when the animals are generally pretty
fresh and always lively and amusing; strangers who are paying
their first visit, however, would do well to provide themselves with
a complete diver's dress, a pickaxe, fog-signal, and a side of raw
beef. There are no fees.
The Dome of the Albert Hall.—At all hours by fire-escape in felt
slippers. Care should be taken to avoid, if possible, going through
the glass roof into the larger organ-pipes.
The Weathercock on the New Law Courts.—In company with the
Lord Chancellor, at any hour after dark, &c, &c.
But will Mr. Dickens kindly look at his capital Dictionary, and
revise still further in the same direction?
The River-Drift Girl.
(Written at SkindU's, and dedicated to Professor Boyd Dawkins.)
0 Riveb-dbift Girl,
With the tangled curl,
Afloat in your light canoe!
Who's happier than
The River-drift Man,
So happy to drift with you!
Oh, 'tis sweet to note,
In the drifting boat—
As olouds drift o'er the blue—
The drifters gay,
As they drift away.
Away in their light canoe.
Appropriate Cricket-Ground.—BatterB-y Park.

THE REWARD OF GENIUS.
Brown {to his Schoolfellow, Jones, the distinguished Man of Letters, successful
Novelist, Dramatist, Ac, <fcc). "Not seen you for Tkn Years! Akd you are
Writing still! So am I. Capital Berth, my dear Boy—Sub-Editor to
the Basket-Maker's Trade Annual. Ah! our work is useful enouoh,
but it doesn't brinq either of us much before the public—now does it?"
LETTEKS TO THE EDITOR.
Sir,—In 18G0 I sent you a joke, which, without any acknowledgment, and
dished up in an almost unrecognisable form, you published years afterwards.
Now, Sir, I see you are at your old game. That picture of yours last week
appeared—or rather the original appeared—in the Dordrecht Boompje, the low
Dutch comio paper, in 1850. Take care, Sir. I remain,
The Man with his Eye on You.
Sir,—I inclose the following. It really happened. My little girl was
coming in from a walk, and her mother asked her where she had been. To which
my little girl (only seven, and as like Millais' picture of " Cherry Ripe" as
two peas) replied quickly, "Out, Mamma. It is early for me to be out, as you
said, that only girls of eighteen could be out." It would make a charming sketch
for one of your talented artists. Yours sincerely,
Address, Sir Richard Doddlemus, R. Doddlemus.
Stuccupo House, Hampstead.
Dear Sir,—I had the pleasure of meeting you at a garden-party some seven
years ago, though, as we were not introduced, you may possibly have forgotten
me. Still, on the strength of this intimaoy, which, 1 am bound to confess is
slight, I beg to enolose you some drawings done by a niece of mine, which I
think display undoubted talent. They are of course crude; but you know, my
dear Sir, that only practice makes perfect, and the Artist is only eleven years
of age. Still, she is very ready to learn, and would gladly take any hints or
advice from Mr. Sambourne, whose works, he may t>e pleased to know, Bhe
greatly admires. It would be a real act of charity to put her pictures in Punch,
as she is one of eleven children, the two eldest boys of whom, you will be sorry to
hear, have lately taken to frequenting public-houses, and betting on horse-races
with the potmen.
Excuse my obtruding these family matters on your notice, but I know that
you are always ready to listen to those in distress. Yours sincerely,
South Btlgravia, S. W. Maria Gushes.
Sir,—Your tone is low, scurrilous, libellous and un-
gentlemanly. That article of yours on Butchers is dis-
graceful, and I hope the trade as one man will rise and
never read your wretched journal again. Of course I am
not in the trade myself. Yours disgustedly,
A Former Buyer.
P.S.—If you want to pick out real abuses, go in for the
Bakers and Fishmongers. I think I might help you there.
Yes!
GLADSTONE'S AMIDST THE RUINS OF
THE SESSION.
"A Session of utter ruin and discomfiture."—Ma. Glad-
stone.
Delexda est! Sounds dreary, does it not,
My phrase of lamentation? Nor, indeed,
Less dreary looks the wasted Session's wretk
Lying around me, lingering last and lone.
I '11 take a seat here on this fallen bulk
Of a lost Bill, of many such so fallen
Most melancholy type. Here, there, all prone,
Scattered and shattered like the column-shards
Of Sardis or Persepolis they lie,
That should have reared so rare an edifice
Of Liberal glory and magnificence.
They never did, wrecked ere well reared by shock
Brute shock of Vandal Warton, or that Hun,
Rude, unrelenting Healy, toppled o'er
By the bull-rush of huge Iconoclast
Of the torn coat-tails; capsized in collision
With sour-faced Salisbury's phalanxed men-at-arms,
Eaten and worn by dull Delay's time-tooth
That gnaws and gnaws with the persistent spite
Of a curst woman's nagging, lo! they lie
In chaos and collapse, the merest mock
Of my sublime foreshadowed large design
Set forth in far Midlothian. Miserable,
Most lame, and impotent conclusion! How
Wonder if smug-faced Stafford slily sneer.
Or black-browed Cecil chortle? Hum! Ha 1
Bad, very bad. And yet, 'tis passing strange
I don't feel half so wretched as I should,
"My bosom's lord sits lightly on its throne,"
And—had I minor vices—I could puff
The mild Manilla 'midst these ruins, nay,
Tipple the well-mixed cup, much, very much,
As Cockneys pic-nic-ing amidst the wreck
Of Melroso or of Medmenham puff the pipe
Or swig the penny-pop. Aha 1 tart Cecil,
"For this relief much thanks." These columns prone
Shall rear again firm-based as Egypt's piles,
Or my Egyptian policy,—there's the building
To set against these ruins. Ruins? Nay!
These be not ruins, but a builder's yard
A little out of order. When, anon,
In chill October, I resume, reshape,
Rule, line-and-plummet, gang my men and gag—
So malice calls it—rude recalcitrance,
Then shall the promise and the potency
Of what Midlothian pictured loom out large
In bulk and beauty matching my large hopes
And visions vivid, darkening the despair
Of sour self-shadowed Salisbury, cheering up
My something fate-chilled followers, leaving me
A better than tree-feller's passing fame,
That of the Liberal Balbus, who can build
As well as batter down. So mote it be!
And now, for further cheer, I '11 take a peep
At the St. James's, see how Greenwood's gall
Like Pennsylvanian oil-well flows and flows.
Political petroleum 'whelming all,
In indiscriminate blasting, soher sense,
Sagacity, good temper, once his own,
As well as all my workings, proved success
Of the All-Hated stirring it, as stones
Stir the hot Geyser to redoubled rage
Of wild up-spouting. It will be such fun I
"a stitch in time saves nine."
The Amalgamated Tailors, with their Benevolent Fund,
and other provident provisions, have been making some
little stir of late. Probably these are the traditional
Nine Tailors who make a man?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

TROUBLE AMONG THE STUBBLE.
Biros are so Wild this Season, that it is found necessary to Tame them.
A HANDBOOK OF KNOWLEDGE.
No. IX.—Railways.
Paet I.—The Company, the Station, the Ticket-Office.
Q. What is a Railway P
A. An ingenious and complex contrivance for extracting as much
money as possible from the travelling publio, and giving it the least
possible amount of convenience and comfort in return.
Q. How is this managed?
A. By means of that Cuttlefish of Commerce, a Company.
Q. What is a Company?
A. A composite partnership for the annihilation of conscience and
the minimising of responsibility.
Q. How is this achieved?
A. By the devices of division and distribution.
Q. Can you explain the processes?
A. It is an admitted maxim that what is everybody's business is
nobody's business. The principle applies with peculiar force to
"business " involving questions of conscience or of responsibility.
Some organisms are only multiplied by division, eaoh section forming
a complete and independent creature. It is precisely the reverse
with conscience and responsibility. A divided responsibility has no
appreciable weight, and a distributed conscience does not work.
There is nothing so conscienceless as corporate responsibility, nor so
irresponsible as corporate conscience.
Q. You spoke of a Company as a cuttle-fish. Would yon liken a
Railway Company to that creature?
A. 11 is more like it than any other Company.
Q. How so?
A. Because it reaches it victims through so many arms and
suckers while it is so difficult for its victims to get at its head.
Q. Illustrate this.
A. In one way among myriads. In pursuance of some autocratic,
irrational and unannounced bye-law from head-quarters a hundred
ticket-collectors at a hundred stations may be ready at any moment
to mulct you in excess fare. It will take weeks of correspondence to
bring the surcharge home to the " Corporate Conscience" in its
hidden lair.
Q. What is a Railway Station P
A. It may best and most briefly be described as a place of public
torture.
Q. What are the kinds of torture therein inflicted upon the
Public P
A. They are so many and subtly varied as almost to defy exhaustive
classification. They may, however, for purposes of illustration, be
ranged under various heads, as, for example:—
1. The torture of Difficult Access.
2. The tortures of Labyrinthine Complexity and Maze-like
Muddle.
3. The torture of Hurry-scurry.
4. The torture of Noise.
5- The torture of Imperative Stupidity.
6. The torture of Clownish Incivility.
7. The tortures of Dirt, Deprivation, and Physical Discomfort
generally.
Q. How is difficulty of access secured?
A. By many ingenious devices, such as the multiplication of steep
slopes and precipitous staircases, the careful laying out of intricate
passages and complicated corridors, the artful adj ustment of numerous
narrow wickets and the sedulously maintained mystery of many and
capriciously used platforms. Perhaps, however, the most success-
fully tormenting of these devices of delay is the great Ticket trick.
Q. What is the special purpose of this device P
A. To make the procuring of the necessary pasteboard-pass as
difficult as possible to the would-be passenger.
Q. For what reason P
A. Reason has nothing whatever to do with Railway regulations.
Q. How is it managed?
A. First, by refusing to issue the ticket for a particular train until
that train is about to start, and a long, close-packed, and agitated
queue of passengers is in waiting; secondly, by making the species
of port-hole through which the tickets are issued so small that only
one passenger at a time can obtain a ticket, and that slowly and with
exceeding difficulty.
Q. What are the results of these singular arrangements P
A. Uncomfortable hurry, great confusion, needless waiting, and
frequent missing of trains. A traveller arriving in good time, must
watchfully linger in a dreary and draughty corridor until it pleases the
haughty young gentlemen within the rabbit-hutch to raise the hatch
thereof. A traveller arriving rather late, must take his place at the
end of a long " tail" of eager and angry applicants, with muoh pro-
bability of getting his ticket just in time to lose his train. In any
case, he has to stoop and shout his instructions through a little
square hole into the reluctant ears of an austere being, who is the
victim of constitutional superciliousness and chronic disgust. This
Diogenes in a box is generally hard of hearing, slow of understand-
ing, and much readier with rude questions than with civil answers.
When he deigns—after the delay due to his dignity—to understand
you aright, he " chucks" your ticket at you in a manner suggestive
of lofty contempt or deep resentment. If you require change, he
"dabs" it down in a scattered heap, leaving you, if you are nervous
or considerate, to claw it up hastily; or, if you are dogged or selfishly
indifferent, to count it carefully. In the former case you may
possibly be cheated. In the latter oase you will certainly be hated—
by the impatient crowd waiting behind you for their turn at the
port-hole. In this dilemma, the printed notification, that you are
requested to count your change before leaving, as no correction can
subsequently be made, will probably strike you as sardonic, if not
impertinent.
Q. But has this painful process always to be gone through before
you can obtain a Railway tioket P
A. Not in its entirety. At slack times, or in little-frequented
Stations, you may escape certain of the worst passages in the ordeal.

You will wait, of oonrse; yon will probably rap repeatedly and
vainly at the wicket; yon will certainly have to bow your head to
the awkwardly-placed hole, and your spirit to the awkwardly-
tempered ticket-clerk. But the hurried crush, the angry and some-
times militant crowd, the lost change, and the missed train—these,
as the cream of the great Ticket Distributing Joke, are commonly
reserved for the Stations von are most likely to have to attend, and
the seasons when you will most probably be compelled to attend
them.
'ENGLISH SPOKEN "-IN FRANCE!
"A piece called Rotten Row, of which the scene is laid in England, will be

the Totcer, the Mansion House, and Hampton Court. The
spectacle is lively. The " High Life" are enjoying themselves.
In one corner there is cock-fighting, in another cricket, in
another the "boxe." The Ladies are sitting round the various
distractions, applauding and partaking of buns and gin. The
Statue of Duk- Wellingtons it in the centre. Enter Sir Glad-
stone driving a four-in-hand. He it drested at a hunter, in a
scarlet coat and top-boots. He comet down, and the four-in-
hand it driven off.

Tableau I.—Sir Gladstone sets to Work.
Henderson-Esquire. Alas I no. I have failed to destroy the House
of Lords. When Gut Faux was about to fire the train, it was dis-
covered that all the Peers had gone to sell their wives at Smithfield!
Sir Gladstone (with a burst of anger). By Jove 1 Henderson-
Esquire, this Gut Faux must die 1 (Giving death-warrant.) See,
it is dated the Fifth of November!
Henderson-Esquire. It shall be done! You shall know that Gut
Faux is no more by a brilliant display of fireworks!
-Sir Gladstone. Good 1 Am I not a Liberal? (With enthusiasm.)
Must I not suppress the Opposition? The gunpowder has failed i
There is but one remedy. We must destroy the House of Lords by
applying the Habeas Corpus!
Henderson-Esquire (shuddering). No, no! It is too horrible!
No, no I
Sir Gladstone. But I say Yes I And now, aa I have out down all
the trees, we will remove this Statue 1
Mysterious Figure (coming from behind effigy of the Duk- Welling-

Sir Gladstone. Not touch it!
Mysterious Figure. No; because this figure commemorates the
glory of France! (Distant applause.) Because it commemorates
the French victory of Waterloo! (Renewed distant applause.) It is
useless to protest. See, the Tower of London has been taken by the
Fenians—they are already attacking the Terrible Volunteers. (Puffs
of tmoke are seen to emerge from the tide of the Tower, followed by
loud reportt.) „ Tyrant, you are too late!
Sir Gladstone. Thwarted! The Fenians! I thought they had gone
to the Expedition Egyptian! But—you who speak—who are you?

WHITBOROUGH. LOW TIDE. ARRIVAL OF THE SCARBY STEAMER.
SAINT WILLIAM.
A Lay of Egypt. A little a la Ingoldthy.
Saint William he was a holy man,
A peace-loving person, I ween, was he;
His worshippers' ranks, And himself, returned thanks
That he was no firebrand, like Benjamin D.
He loved Peace and Liberty, East or West;
Of the queerest cnt and the seediest brown
Were his SaintBhip's clothes, And his shirt-collar rose
Till it seemed on a level almost with his crown.
Saint William mused on the banks of the Nile,
A Grand Old Saint, going; on for fourscore.
His motto was Pax, And war and its whacks
He regarded as bad, and no end of a bore.
Little he dreamed—that holy man!—
Of aping of bellicose Ben's bad tricks.
When he was aware Of a rumpus there,
Which put our good Saint in a bit of a fix.
For there was a party, one Arabi hight—
A person well known to the localpolice—
Making tyrannous claim, In fair Liberty's name,
And stirring up War in the mask of Peace.
He was breeding of strife between East and West,
And says he to our Saint, "Will you please stand by P
You 've no business here, So pray don't interfere I
And my work must appeal to your sympathy."
Saint William he paused—'twas an artful stroke—
But a Saint, if not always too icily prudent,
May have keener nose, Than some people suppose,
And as good as a sinner's at " sniffing a rodent."
So he turned to a Quaker who walked at his side—
A Brummagem blade who him company bore—
And he says, says he, "This is fiddle-de-dee.
I am game for a shine on the Old Nile shore."
Away went that Quaker, away like a shot,
The thought of belligerence made him feel faint.
Says he, "There's some flaw In your Moral Law.
What, double your fists? You rre a nice sort of Saint!"
Away went Sir Wilfrid, away likewise,
As swift as an Echo, went Passmoee Edwards,
Sour Scribe, washy Wag; And both given to " nag,"
Like good Mrs. Caudle when journeying bedwards.
But our peaceful Saint William he stood to his guns,
And Arabi found him unable to frighten
The Militant Saint, He had loved to paint
As " that long-winded, white-livered old Son of Sheitan!
So straight at our Saint he hurled the weight
Of his very whoppingest, weightiest shot,
But that shot bounded back, To its sender—whack!
And—well, Akabi caught it,—remarkably hot 1
Moral.
Quakers and Jokers, Tories and Turks,
And bilious scribes, whosoever ye be,
A Saint may be able To see through a fable,
And know Freedom's voice from pure fiddle-de-dee.
Don't trust overmuch to a sanctified mug,
Nor deem folded hands as from fighting debarred.
Such hands may give stingo,
As hot as a Jingo,
And Saints, when they hit, nit remarkably hard.
A Venetian Ratepayer.
A Shakspearian Critic infers, from a passage in the Merchant
of Venice, that the Venetian Jews were subject to a peculiar and
probably excessive parochial impost:—
"Shy lock. Signor Antonio, many a time and oft
On the Rialto have you rated me."
At this rate the assessment of Rates in Venioe was not vested in
the Vestry, but decreed by a delegate, and Antonio seems to have
been the Bating Officer.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL

THE POOR MAN'S FRIEND.
(According to the Lights of Dr. Siemens, President of the British Association.)
OUT OF TOWN.
Out of Town, say on the River,
You can spend a pleasant time,
Where the usual aspens quiver,
As they always do in rhyme.
Then with Bass's amber gleam let
Some fair maid the beaker crown.
Oh 1 'tis pleasant by a streamlet,
Out of Town 1
Out of Town, say on the Dee-side,
Where the air is fresh and clear.
You can wander, while the sea-side
Tempts its thousands every year.
There s a charm about the ocean,
But your smile becomes a frown
At the Vesper's lively motion—
Out of Town!
Out of Town, in Alpine valleys,
Now be-praised and now deoried,
Where the silver streamlet sallies
Down the mighty mountain side.
You can try a little sketching,
But the shadows come too brown,
When a lady looks so " fetching,"
Out of Town!
Out of Town, by dismal Calais,
To Parisian joys once more,
And the dinners in the Palais
Royal are not as of yore.
Yet, though you may do in clover,
And all thoughts of work may drown,
You '11 be glad when days are over—
Out of Town!

his beer."

PUNCH'S ADIEU TO CETEWAYO.
"Cetewato desired it to be known that, after seeing the representatives
of the National Temperance League, he could receive no more deputations."
"'I can only say,' said he,' that, as a nation, my people are, so to speak,
abstainers.'"—Daily Papers.
Adieu, Great Cetewato! Oh, my heart is very sad!
The pleasant road of Melbury is anything but glad:
The Nubian is ready—the mission now is o'er—
A thousand deputations stand in sorrow on the shore!
And as I shed a manly tear, and grasp that swarthy hand,
I '11 tell you what you shouldn't do when back in Zululand I
Don't ride about on bicycles, nor toddle in the Zoo,
And never play at lansquenet, at euchre, or at loo;
Don't flutter on the Stock Exchange, nor "crackers" stand on
"cracks,"
Nor play at Nap till 5 a.m., nor foot it at Almack's!
Nor smoke Parascho cigarettes, nor weeds of choicest brand,
And drink not deeply of the " Boy," when you 're in Zululand I
Don't hold a toothpick in your mouth, nor sport a solitaire,
Don't spend your nights at music-halls and "rally r
round the
chair!"
Don't condescend to countenance the beauties of Burlesque,
Nor rave about the ankles of each dancer picturesque!
Don't long for little dinners at the "Bristol" or the " Grand,"
And at stage-doors ne'er lurk about, when you 're in Zululand!
You mustn't sup off broiled bones, and never must confess
A hankering for bitter beer, a longing for Guinness I
You mustn't think of sherry, or wish for claret-cup,
And never hint at breakfast that you want a " pick-me-up!"
But give each rash retainer a wholesome reprimand,
Who dares to hint at B.-and-S. when back in Zululand!
Oood-bye, Great Cetewato! I think you'll understand
That what it right in London may be wrong in Zululand,'
PHYSICKING THE PRESS.
A short time ago, the Council of the society presided over by Sir
William Jenner passed a resolution to the effect "That the system
of extensively advertising medical works, and the custom of giving,
whether for publication or not, laudatory certificates of medicinal
and other preparations, and of medical and surgical appliances, is
misleading to the Public, derogatory to the dignity of the profession,
and contrary to the traditions and resolutions of the Royal College
of Physicians." With all due respect to Sir William and his (no
doubt) extremely distinguished colleagues, this reads very muoh like
nonsense. Surely a "laudatory certificate" of a "medicinal and
other preparation," if honestly given, can scarcely be "misleading
to the Public." If it is not honestly given.l.then the sooner the
certificate-writer is deprived of his diploma the better.
Again, what is there more "derogatory to the dignity of the pro-
fession " in " extensively advertising medical works," than in writing
or printing them? The very faot that a book is offered for circula-
tion presupposes that the proper means will be taken for securing as
many readers as possible. Advertising is publicity, and without
Sublicity Authorship becomes an absurdity. But, no doubt, the very
istinguished Council of the Royal College may say, with truth,
that thev never write books themselves. Quite so; but that is no
reason why they should wrong Authors who do!
As to " certificate giving" and " medical work advertising" being
"contrary to the traditions and resolutions of the Royal College of
Physicians," that is a matter for argument. A search in the pages
of medical journals of years gone by, will certainly show that many
a distinguished member of the Society has availed himself "exten-
sively " of the advantages afforded by the Press of giving publicity
to the fact that he has written useful and scientific medical works.
Under all the circumstances of the case, consequently the President,
on behalf of the Council (which he adorns, but, it is to be hoped,
scarcely represents), may fairly be called upon for an explanation.
The Better Part of Valour.—Discretion. How so? It dis-
tances Valour in the long run.

The Morning Pott, in an

Temperance League to inter-

observes that:—
"A statistician with a turn for
curious calculations once com-
puted that at least forty per cent.
of the unniifl] gum of matrimonial
proposals were the direct product
of the champagne consumed at the
suppers which form so agreeable
an interlude at dances."
Doesn't this information
look rather too likely to deter
Paterfamilias, with a family
of spinsters, from countenanc-
ing the Temperance League?

For cooking, on the whole,
Gas will be found to serve as

At any rate, as coal.

But ah! there won't it stop?
Oh no I for it will even do

THE ADVANTAGES OF A GAS-STOVE.
(Benevolently dedicated to Those wlw contemplate giving up Coal,)
"You see all you have to do," said our friend, "is to turn on
this; light that; and there you are. It gives out a splendid heat,
and saves a lot in coals."
However, our friend did not actually "turn on this, and light
that." He excused himself on the score that it was an unusually
warm day, and that his wife would be in presently. I observed that
the fire-place was filled with some unnaturally red pieces of brick,
sprinkled freely with dust, and had a generally dismal and deserted
appearance.
Ah, you should see
it lighted," he continued, in answer to my
, and," this he said very confidentially, and
look. It simply glows,
as if he were letting me into a secret worth millions of money, "if
you keep it burning all night, you can boil a kettle on the top of it in
the morning!"
This inducement settled the matter, and finding that the man
"who had put it up for a mere trifle" lived in the neighbourhood,
we went in search of him.
The man lived in a small shop, amongst an assortment of tiles.
He was seated on an unfinished mantelpiece, with his feet on the
hobs of a gas stove. Round about him were specimens of stained
glass windows. He looked like a "model," who had been found
not quite the thing " for a mediaeval saint, and had consequently
been kept on the strength of the establishment in some other
oapaoity. Apparently, from the atmosphere of the place, he had
been employed for several months in the exclusive manufacture of
glue. He sprang up from his tiles and stained glass, and was all
attention.
I was careful to impress upon him that I wanted him to do nothing.
That I had seen a gas-stove in a friend's house, and, although
scornfully rejecting the notion that I possibly could care to have one
in my own, would yet like an estimate.
At the word " estimate," the man jumped into the air. Would I
have gas-stoves in the kitchen, the nurseries, the drawing-rooms, the
conservatories? Yes, he could put one in the garden if necessary.
Before I could say " Jack Robinson," he had sprung up a ladder,
dived down into a cellar, and covered me with "Plans" and
"Diagrams." I was very much annoyed. I told him roughly, nay
brutally, that under no circumstances whatever would he be
employed. Instead of being disheartened, this assertion seemed to
give him unlimited satisfaction. He assured me that he hadn't the
smallest notion that he would be engaged to do anything for me, but
that for all that he would be only too delighted to call at my house
(several miles off) and give me any information I required. Upon
these conditions, I made an appointment to see him on the following
morning. He conveyed by his manner at parting, that his life was
devoted, out of pure benevolence, to the furnishing of superfluous
estimates to the idly curious. At the appointed hour he called,
bearing with him a huge carpet bag. His manner had changed. He
was now a little sorrowful, but very firm. His demeanour suggested
that he feared he must have been mistaken in me. His tone broadly
hinted that if I sent him away without an order, (as I might do
with my blaok heart) I was a lost householder for ever more. This
made lam sorrowful. Tfin firmness was shown by his evident deter-
mination to save me in spite of myself.

DIAGNOSIS.
Keeper. "Thbek!—I thought hi worn't a Ge'tleman! 'Shoots 'ith Brown Cartridges, and On't gi' me 'Alf-a-Crown!"
"I have seen the downstair rooms, Sir," he said, " and can easily
light them with the gas to-morrow. I have wired down to the men
at Essex, and they can be here by seven o'clock in the morning.
But one thing, Sir, your mantelpiece in the dining-room must have a
marble fender!"
He said this with the determination of a Judge sentencing a
convict t» five years' penal servitude. He implied that there was no
appeal-, and that the only way of expiating my past crimes was
through an order for the article he had specified.
My wood was up. Iron will met iron will. "We fought over the
gas-works for twenty minutes. I would have nothing. I withered
the marble fender with suggestions of objections from the ground,
landlord, and waxed eloquent—I was nearly moved to tears Dy my
subject—upon the superior merits of oil over vapour. The man was
an able tactician. He saw that a compromise was necessary. He
gave way by degrees. The fender was first abandoned, then the
chandeliers in the drawing-room, then the brackets in the conserva-
tory. But he made so fierce and determined a stand in the front
bed-room, that I was forced to surrender. He consequently retired
with the spoils of victory—an order for a gas-stove. I may here
say that subsequently, on presenting his bill, I found that my per-
severing friend wanted to charge me nearly double what I had
proposed to pay him, on the score that "he had only given me an
estimate approximately." After a deadly quarrel, in which he
threatened me with the County Court, and I htm with a letter to the
Times, we compromised the matter, apparently to our mutual dissa-
tisfaction. My last words to him were, "I '11 go to some one else
another time!" His to me (with a grin), "If you do, Sir, make
him put it on paper!"
To resume—the next morning a general hammering all over the
place ushered in the autumn sun. The mess had come upon us.
Carpets pulled up here, dirty footmarks there, and confusion every-
where. I looked into the drawing-room, and found a person in fus-
tian with his head up the chimney. He leisurely stopped what he
was doing, brought down his head, put on his hat, and prepared to
enjoy a conversation. He seemed disinclined to discuss his work,
but when sharply questioned upon the point, hazarded an opinion
that "perhaps arter all he might make a good job of it." What
did he think of gas-stoves? He carefully undid all he had been
doing for the last half-hour, to get into a proper frame of mind to
answer me. Then he rubbed his chin, and scratched his head. Then
he looked at me, grinned, and replied, "Well, some likes 'em, and
some don't." I mentioned the patent we were about to use.
"Oh, you've got that.'" he exclaimed, in anything rather than
an encouraging tone, and once more disappeared up the chimney.
For four days we lived in a small colony of gas-men. "We met
them going up-stairs, we found them in cupboards, we came upon
them in all sorts of nooks and corners. _ They banged doors, thumped
ceilings, and must have left an impression upon our neighbours, that
we had suddenly let our house for the months preceding Christmas
to a clown rehearsing the rallies in a forthcoming Covent Garden
pantomime. Every time I met the person in fustian, he assured me
—but not in too confident a tone— that, arter all, he might make
a good job of it."
At length we were free. The workmen had disappeared, and I
was face to face with the Btove. It looked cold and uncomfortable.
It was painfully red, and seemed to be a receptacle for a number of
old bricks. I had received my instructions. I was " to turn on
this, and light that." I armed myself with a candle, and twisted
round a screw.
There was a hissing noise resembling a number of serpents im-
patient for their dinner. I waved the flaring candle wildly about
under the bars. The hissing oontinued, growing louder and louder.
Then came a blaze and a bang, which knocked me backwards, and
put out the taper. Then a feeble flickering blue flame, resembling
a corpse-light on a churchyard in a haunted village, crept up the
brioks, and hovered above them. Then a perfume resembling an
essence of glue and treacle, pervaded the room impartially. I then
felt called upon for a defence.
"You see," I observed, "that the stove oan be lighted, com-
paratively speaking, without danger, and that, although the heat it
gives out, if not exaotly that of coal, is distinctly notioeable. More-
over, the hissing sound is certainly not louder than that which would
be unquestionably caused by a boiling kitchen kettle. And */ there
is any smell, at any rate"
"That stove," said a firm but soft voice at my elbow, "must be
removed."
And it has been!

All the troops as well. Ironclads, artillery, hundreds of transports
—this is really war 1 I am transported. General order issued—
troops to be ready to start to-morrow for Mecca, as Arabi has

"Yes, of course." They reply that it 11 take " three months to get

Nothing for it but to return to Ismailia.

Scene—A Roam at Head-quarters. Sir Gabnet discovered
dictating to his Aide-de-camp.
Sir Garnet. Have you put down that last sentence about myself P
Aide-de-camp. YeB, Sir Gabnet.
•Sir Garnet. Well, let's see. The troops didn't retreat the other
evening, in the faoe of overwhelming odds, as they ought to have
dona, Jbe German Critics will be down upon me for that. What
shafl. I say?
Aide-de-camp. Something about luck, Sir Gabnet?

levity! Let me see—where were we?
Aide-de-camp. In the place where you were going to excuse your-
self for keeping a force only sufficient for a reconnaissance, to fight
against overwhelming odds a pitched battle.
Sir Garnet. Ah, to be sure I Well—let me see. How would this
do P "It being contrary to the traditions of the Queen's Service to
retreat in the face of any number of Egyptian troops, I determined
to maintain my position. How does that read?
Aide-de-camp. Capitally! I should think it will surprise the
German Critics very much indeed, when they learn that Her Majesty's
Army have so quaint a regulation I
Sir Garnet (suspiciously). Hum I (Considers.) Let me see.
The Infantry did not arrive in time to do much P
Aide-de-camp. Not much, Sir Gabnet.
Sir Garnet. Well, you can put, "The Infantry were handled
magnificently by their courageous commander, who never forgets his
personal oourtesy even in the moment of direst danger."
Aide-de-camp. Yes, Sir Gabnet.
Sir Garnet. Go on—" They gained my approbation and deserved
my applause. I was well satisfied, I am pleased to say, with their
conduct, and I took an early opportunity of saying how I had seen
tbem, how I had watched them, how I had approved of them."
There, be careful how you write that, as my rivals always declare I
make too frequent use of the personal pronoun. Have you got it down?
Aide-de-camp. Yes, Sir Gabnet.
Sir Garnet. Well, let me see. Ought to say something about the
Cavalry. "Although impeded by the sand, which prevented them
from advancing at a greater speed than a slow trot, the Household
Cavalry charged with a dash and a brilliancy worthy of the birth
and breeding of those who commanded them." How's that P
Aide-de-camp (deferentially). Well, Sir Gabnet, excellent—
but has birth and breeding much to do with cavalry charges?
Sir Garnet. Everything, Sir—everything! But I will tone it
down afterwards. Let me see, I must say something about the
Cavalry General. Ah, to be sure!" He displayed, on this occasion,
that coolness and courage for which he has been long renowned.
How do you like that?
Aide-de-camp. Isn't it a little too patronising, Sir Gabnet?
Sir Garnet (severely). No, Sir, it isn't! I am surprised at you,
Sir I Mind I—I—I am awarding praise! Put this down as a con-
clusion :—" The whole Army behaved with that gallantry, that
nerve, that chivalrous earnestness, so peculiarly the attributes of
Her Majesty's troops. In fact, once more the British Soldier, by
Mb magnificent dash and glorious stubbornness, earned the wonder
of the world and the applause of an admiring universe!" How's that P
Aide-de-camp. First-rate—(aside)—for Astley's! However,
he is a magnificent fellow, and we can forgive him his little foibles.
After all, he hasn't many of them! And if he can't do without
them, we can't do without him.'
\_Scene closes in upon Sir Gabnet preparing to gain his next
victory.
They were talking of iEsop's fables. "iEsop was no fool," said
Young Joe from Eton to Lavinia. Mrs. Ramsbotham, entering at
the moment, overheard this, and at once replied, "Well, I don|t
know that. At all events, it was very wicked of him to sell his
birthright for a mess of porridge."

At a Cost of Five Millions Sterling,

Devoting henceforth
The lighter Moments of Colonial Captivity
To obtaining successively
A Mastery over the Construction of the Accordion,
An Acquaintance with the Peculiarities of Whiskey,
And a Respect for the Epistolart Talents of Lord Kihberley.

In a Back Street in Kensington,
To take down an Iron Bedstead,

An Inspection of Mr. Whiteley's Establishment,
And a Ride in the Cabin of a Woolwich Steamboat,
Would favourably impress
With a Conviction of the Permanent Stability and Extent
Of the British Empire.
Thus, after showing,
By referring to Her Most Gracious Majesty as "His

And sliding down the Balusters to Dinner,
That he was more solicitous
Of manifesting kindly Devotion to the Crown
Than of cultivating
The Nicer Usages of Society,
He was Restored to his Rights,
With an Imperial and adventurous Magnanimity,
That left him no Alternative but to express
His grateful Acknowledgments,
After the Custom of his Fathers,

TROPES FOR TRIPPERS.

A Frowning Pie apiue.


A Shady Bank.
Cook and Gaze.
A LITTLE HOLIDAY.
A few Happy-Thought Note) among the Hills in Wale*. Invitation
— Visit—The Bard—An Interview.
Invitation from my friend Davie Wtnevax of Glwanffai Castle.
Glwanffai is a word which at first sight presents some difficulty,—
not so much in writing as pronunciation.
[Happy Thought.—In speaking to Wtnevan, say familiarly, and
in an off-hand manner, "The Castle," without particularising. I
notice, subsequently, that most people adopt this plan, even the
Welsh native visitors; from which 1 conclude that they are a little
afraid of their own language. Still it is a dangerous thing to
presume on their apparent ignorance, and to select some absurd-
looking word as a suoject for a jest, because you are sure to find
that these higgledy-piggledy-looking syllables, which present the
appearance of one of those remarkably senseless combinations formed
by a fortuitous concourse of ivory letters when you are trying to find
out " what word has been given you," compose a word expressive of
all that is most sacred and venerable in that particular language.
Happy Thought.—When inolined to make a joke about a foreign
word, restrain yourself until you've clearly and beyond all doubt
ascertained its exact and oorrect meaning. You may lose your
excellent joke, but you save your character for reverence and good
taste, you nurt no one's susceptibilities, and if you discover the word
is harmless, the opportunity for your witticism may crop np again
in the course of years. Only, if it does occur again years hence, by
that time you will probably have forgotten the witticism. Lost
opportunities for repartees and witticisms never return.
Subject for Essay.—"The Lost Witticism," a poem for musio
like " The Lost Chord"—a. title, by the way, suggested to my mind
whenever there '• a parcel I want to do up, and when " there must
be a piece of string somewhere "—and there isn't.]
David Wynevan, of Glwanffai, says, "Come to the Eisteddfod.
If you 've never heard one, you '11 be interested." I reply, "Never
heard one. Will certainly come. Much interested."
I tell my friends in London that I am going to be present for the
first time at an Eisteddfod. They ask me what it is like. This is a
foolish question on their part, as I have already explained to them
that I have never yet seen one. However, I describe to them what I
think it will be like, judging from a vague recolleotion of pic-
tures of some Great Eisteddfod gathering in the illustrated papers
years ago. (On subsequently testing the accuracy of my memory on
this subject, I am not at all certain that the pictures were not of
something totally different, in quite another quarter of the globe,—
indeed I rather fancy they were copies of some great originals
depicting scenes in Bacred history.) I give them my idea of the
sort of Eisteddfod I am going to witness. I say: "You view the
magnificent country, wild nills, cloud-capped mountains stretohing
away in the distance, here and there the remains of an old feudal
ruin: on one of the hills a Druidical pile "—-
"What's the good of a carpet on a hill ?" asks Johnnie Prosser,
interrupting me.
11 don t know much of Prosser, except that he is called familiarly
"Johnnie " —[there seem to be a number of "Johnnies,
Htronras," and "Freddies," about jnst now, all muoh the
same age, as if some twenty-five years ago there had been a
Christening Conspiracy]—and that he has generally been described
to me, by hearty people, as, " Oh, he 's the cheeriest chap in the
world "—which might be the title of a song to the tune and metre
of Kingsley's "Broken Doll." Chorus I "The cAeeriest, cheeriest,
cAeeriest, cheeriest, che-er-iest chap in the world!"
"I didn't say there was a carpet on the hill," I explain, pleasantly.
"Oh, didn't you?" returns the cheeriest chap. "I thought you
said ' on a hill there was a DruidicaTpile.'"
Whereat they all laugh.
If there is a thing I detest when you're really talking seriously,
and when everybody is serious while you 're talking, it is a stupid
pun. I smile, deprecatingly, on the punmaker, and continue my
glowing description of the coming Eisteddfod :—
"A grand old Druidical pile,—the ancient Bards—they're still
called ' Bards,' " I explain, and the dress is kept up,—at least," I
say, anticipating some stupid remark on the idea of "the dress
being kept up," from Johnnir the Punmaker, "bo I believe ; and
then the people from all parts of the Principality "—(N.B.—A great
point, in speaking of Wales to Welshmen, is to style it " the Prin-
cipality ")—" gathering together in a variety of national costumes."
"I know," exclaims a Lady of the party, I know. The women in
tall hats and caps, and the men—I forget how the men were
dressed,"—she finishes, and turns to me for information.
Someone suggests, "Oh, it's something like the Bretons!"
"I fancy it is," I say, not liking to commit myself irrevocably on
this point. Then I go on. "The Bards have harps, and there are
about twenty-five of them playing at once Borne wild and beautiful
Welsh air "—(I pause—as it suddenly occurs to me that I am merely
repeating an impressive description once given me by a friend of a
grand Jewish function at a synagogue in Paris). Taking advantage
of this break, somebody asks, Rather difficult to hear the harps
among the mountains, eh?"
There are a variety of opinions expressed on the subject. I get in
the words " acoustic properties," and propound some theory of echoes,
which seems to explain the matter satisfactorily to everybody.
Afterwards, on thinking it over, I try to recollect what it was I said
about Echoes which seemed to give such a thoroughly satisfactory
explanation to everybody.
[Note for Pyschological work.—Isn't it the nearest thing to
inspiration, to be explaining clearly to your listeners something
utterly unintelligible to yourself, and then to be unable to recall
your own perfectly convincing explanation? New Night Thoughts.
After-dinner Series.] _ -
However, everyone says it must be a very grand sight, and all
envy my being present on such an occasion. Johnnie tells me he is
going down to see the show (this is how he puts it) himself. On
comparing notes I find he is also a guest at the Castle. He adds,
"We shall have a real cheery time of it." I am delighted to hear
it. I ask him if he's ever been there before, to which he replies,
"Often; awfully cheery lot"—but, as this somehow doesn't convey
to my mind exactly what I had anticipated of a solemn national
Bardic sort of Gathering of the Clans, I ask him rather anxiously,
"I suppose you 've not been there on an occasion like this, eh?" he
replies, carelessly, "No; I've never been down there for one of
their local sing-songs. Don't believe it's up to much, myself. And
if they 're going to have all this careering about the hills that you
say, it '11 play the deuce with the fjrouse."
He is evidently not sympathetic on the subject. However, he
doesn't contradict my description of what I think an Eisteddfod
ought to be. We Bhall meet anon. We do meet anon at The Castle.
Wtnevan, my host, is full of the coming Eisteddfod. He has some
nervous fear that I am going to laugh at it. I protest that nothing is
farther from my thoughts. I earnestly assure him that I am deeply
interested in the keeping-up of any distinctly national custom. At
this answer he gains confidence, and then expatiates on the Bubjeot,
giving me the history of Eisteddfods. He pauses from time to time,
as we sit on the parapet of the terrace overlooking the moat, and looks
at me, inquiringly, to see what effect the various bits of antiquarian
information have on me. I am impressed; I listen attentively: he is
pleased. I listen with respectful attention, and he is more pleased.
Somehow it occurs to me that I am listening to a speech. Occasion-
ally I nod my head, not sleepily, but intelligently; and sometimes I
say, "Certainly!" "Exactly!" or "Quite so!" or "Indeed!"
which correspond to "Hear! hear!" "Hear!" and "Breathless
attention," and are clearly exactly what he wants, as, when I sub-
sequently hear him speaking from the Presidential Chair of the
Eisteddfod assembly, the faot breaks upon me, with conviction, that
he has been trying all the leading points of his address on me, to see
how they would go.
He tells me there is a Bard in the Castle at that moment. The
Bard has a title in his own language, which, translated, means
"The Soaring Eagle." He tells me all the Bards have descriptive
titles, such as The Roaring Lion, the Howling Deer, and so forth.
It reminds me of the names in Fenimore Cooper's novels about
the Redskins.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[Happy Thought.—New Titles, The Whistling Wind, The Howling
Stag, The Singing Mouse, The Whistling Oyster, and a lovely one,
The Thundering Lyre.]
Remembering that pipers are attached to noble Scotch Houses, I
remark that the presence of the Bard at the Castle is quite in keeping
with the feudal oharaoter of the place. My hostj I fanoy, doesn't
quite seem to understand the observation, but smiles, and says Yes.
[Happy Thought.—Leave it at this, and don't explain.]
After a few seconds' silence, during which my host has evidently
decided in his own mind that my last observation contained some
subtle sarcastic allusion to the national musical festival, he says to
me, in a tone of confidentially mild remonstrance, "Don't say any-
thing before the Bard that could let him think you 're laughing at
the Eisteddfod."
Once more I hasten to assure him, more earnestly than ever, that,
either before or behind the Bard, nothing is further from my ideas.
"Well, that's all right," returned my host, evidently considerably
relieved. "I only mentioned it, you know.
He seems to think that I have aeoepted his hospitality for the
express purpose of ridiculing national manners and customs, for
which I have really and constitutionally the most profound respect.
1 should like to see the Bard, probably a blind one, with his harp.
1 don't like to ask anything about him, lest my question should
re-awaken the suspicion as to my motive for inquiring, so I hold my
tongue. Wonder if the Bard is in the kitchen before the fire?
or in a keeper's lodge? or up in a watch-tower t or wandering about
the mountains, ready to oome in—very ready to come in—at supper-
time? Wonder if he has fits of inspiration, and suddenly bursts in
upon yoa, harp and all, with a chorus when you least expect it?
[Happy Thought.—Look my door while toiletting for dinner.]
Doming down about five minutes before anybody else, I am alone
in the drawing-room. While wondering who is here, besides
Johnnie Pkosser, who has, I hear, already arrived, door opens,
and a Gentleman enters, whose face is somehow familiar to me, and
who, from his dress, complexion, and general bearing, I settle in
my own mind, is a foreigner,—probably an Italian. He is associated
in my memory with either music or conjuring—I can't tell which
exactly; but were he to produce a short blaok wand tipped with
brass, and tap the lid of one of the table ornaments sharply, to con-
vince me there was nothing in it, or if he suddenly snook out a
handkerchief, flourished it over his arm, and brought Out a bowl of
fish, I should not be in the least astonished, but should applaud, and
try to get him to teach me how it was done. On the other hand, were
he suddenly to sing a snatch from a tenor air. with great fervour,
I fancy his name would come back to me. As, however, he does
neither of these things, but simply and gracefully—an Italian is
always graceful—bows, I salute him, and open the conversation with
a few original remarks on the weather, and thence, by an easy pro-
eess, to what is the uppermost topio just now; i.e., Welsh National
Customs, the Eisteddfod, and the Family Bard.
The stranger is a foreigner decidedly, hut of what nationality I
can't make out. Austrian, perhaps, or Russian. When ia doubt,
it is generally safe to say Russian. He might be Swiss, or a Greek.
Give him a black, picturesque cloak and hat, from underneath
which his raven locks fall on his shoulders, and the point of a
dagger gleaming out from somewhere, and he d be a Brigand of the
Abruzzi down to the ground. [Happy Thought.—Good name for
Opera, The Brigand of the Abmizi. Opening chorus of the Abruzzi
masked. On second thoughts, are they people or mountains f ]
I take it for granted that this is his first visit to Wales, and
therefore I am inclined to converse with him from the ignorant-
foreigner point of view. I have never before been in Wales
myself, bat a foreigner has been less in Wales than I have. I give
him my impressions about Wales, as I imagine it is; I give him my
notions on feudal customs as kept up in Brittany (he doesn't know
Brittany); and, by way of drawing Trim out, I put him an artfully
leading question when I say, "I suppose these customs are much
the same in Italy?"
"Yes," he says, with an aooent which is difficult to associate with
any spoken language I am the least acquainted with—[Stop 1 can he
be a Spaniard ?—he uses energetic action, but has a soft insinuating
manner, and pronounces each Syllable distinctly, while speaking
deliberately, and clearly choosing most excellent English.]—" Yes;
there is al-so the same cus-tom in Ger-ma-ny. The Welsh, in-deed,
are a ve-ry mu-si-cal people," and his voice rises on the last syllable
but one. and then finishes on a semitone. [Note.—Perhaps he is
talking " in an uncompleted seventh." Think I 're heard of this in
music". Mem— Ask ahout it."]
The effect is musically pleasant, but Whether he is a Spaniard, an
Austrian, a Swiss, or a Russian, I cannot make out. [Happy
Thought.— Verhups he is ft Gregorian. Or an Uncompleted Seventh
of the Gregorian Family.]
"But,''I say, eontmhihg the subject on my own hnee, "in this
age of newspapers and railway literature, ffle ide* of leepfng ft
Family Bard seems rather odd, doesn't it?"
The mysterious foreigner doesn't comprehend me. I explain to
him that our host has a Bard attached to the house, a real old Welsh
Bard, who is now, I believe, out on the MUl with the WeLsh
mutton.
"Re-al-lyi1" murmurs the intelligent foreigner, evidently much
astonished by my information. This is clearly his first visit here.
"Yes," I go on, "Wynevan calls him ' The Bard,' and I suppose
he '11 come in after dinner, and give us a tune—a real Welsh air—on
his harp."
"Well, that is stir-range," observes my foreign friend, to whom 1
am a perfect gold-mine of information. I ne-ver have heard of this
Bard. Are you su-ef f" He means "sure."
"Oh. dear, yes," I reply, confidently; "Wynevan told me to
himself just no*. He said that the Bard's name in Welsh—of
course I can no more pronounce it than you can the patois of your
own country "—intelligent foreigner nods and smiles blandly—
and once more I wonder what countryman he is ?—" bnt I rather
think the translation of it in English is ' Howling Stag,' or some-
thing of that sort "—and then I ge on with my humorous suggestions
for new names for the Bards, such as "The Thundering Lyre" and
so forth: and being in full confidential swing of talk, always from
the instruct-the-ignorant-foreigner point of view, I repeat Wyn-
evan's warning to me—[Happy Thought.— Good title for Welsh novel
—" Wynevan s Warning, in Three Vols. Second Edition now ready"]
—and caution the foreigner hot on any account to say anything
disparaging of the Eisteddfod, or, in fact, of anything nationally
Welsh, in the Bard's presence.
"I should of oourse "—why of course ?—" be the last person to
do such a thing. But I con-fess you as-to-nish me. Mr. Wtnevak
has ne-ver told me"
"Ah!" exclaims Wynevan, entering suddenly, and referring to
his watch, as if he had been doing a distance against time, and were
just finishing it. "Capital! You know each other, eh f"
"No, we haven't that, &c, &c," we both murmur, indistinctly.
and then commence bowing and smiling at one another, like clock-
work figures just wound up, in a vague but sociable way, as if we
were so delighted with each other's society that names were really of
no sort of conseqnenoe.
"Oh, you don't; eh?" repeats our host. "Then allow me—Mr.
Edwabds."
Bless my soul! That's why I knew his facel Seen and heard
him at concerts. Of course he is a musician, and the finest harpist
in the world! I am delighted. But .... stop I I take Wynevan
aside, and say, "Then he *s a Welshman!"
'' Rather!" replies Wynevan. "Edward Edwabds 1 Welshman
of Welshmen. Itold you about him before dinner."
"About him!" I exclaim, under my breath, and a light suddenly
dawning upon me. "But you only mentioned about the Bard—the
man with the diffloult name—the ' Soaring Eagle.'"
"Well," says Wynevan apart to me, and indicating, by a glance
over his shoulder, that he is speaking of my supposed Intelligent
Foreigner, though we both pretend to be examining a work of Art
on the walls, "he is ' The Soaring Eagle.' He's the head swell of

I read them aloud last night to my f amily.oirole, and one and all recog-
nised the originals. I feel assured that their publication in your

Tooting, where, indeed, it is already pretty generally known, and
thought highly of. Yours, sinoerely,

That joke of yours last week my brother made quite a year
ago. You must have heard it, and unjustifiably used it. Send
remittance at once, or shall place matter in .my solicitor's' hands
forthwith. Address,

Deab Punch,
You are in the theatrical world, and know all the theatrical
fellows. I wish you would tell me the right names, ages, and
addresses of all the Girls at the Gaiety Theatre. Also, where is a
good place to buy jewels like they wear on the stage, which look
real by gaslight. Yours, ever,

Sib,
You are too fiddle-faddle. The oountry is being ruined by

"Irish Atrooities," and saying to Granville, "Remember!"
would be vastly popular. Yours truly,

Sib,
When you pitch into Fishmongers you ought to know
something about them. That you evidently don't, or, if you do,
won't or oan't speak truth, is clear from your article on Fishmongers.
I hope they will denounce and ruin you. I am not in the trade my-
self. Yours, a. Hater of Lies.

Many years ago I had the pleasure of travelling in the
same carriage with your father, from Waterloo to Clapham Junc-
tion. Since then, I am sorry to say, the world has not gone well
with mejand, struggle as I may, I cannot keep my head above
water. Would you, for the sake of old times, lend me five pounds
till the end of the month, when I am certain to obtain some luorative
appointment. I am sure your father would have granted this request,
and I feel confident that his generous heart has descended to his son.
Yours, truly,

EXTRACTS FROM MY REMINISCENCES.
(A.D. 1930.)
[Ity Thomas Carlyle ifozley Scarabxus.)
If was in 1882 that I met for the first, and, I am happy lb
sny, the last time, Hf.krt Irviko, a squat, fattish, vulgar man with
a jerky manner of repeating "dontchyerknow." He attempted
cordiality and politeness, but the effort on his part to disguise his
feelings of hatred towards all those who did not appreciate his
aoting was disgustingly transparent. I asked him for a box in his
theatre, which he gave me. I had chosen it for a night on which
I was engaged; so, as far as I was concerned, that box remained
empty the entire evening. Bat very likely he had given it te
three or four friends the same night, besides letting it twice ever.
Sat next to a tall, lithe man called Linlet Sa.muuu hwk at a very
bad dinner, given by some man whose name I have now forgotten,
but whom I remember to have been an egregious ass. I conversed
with the man Samiiourne on the subject of Punch, not that I took
any interest in that remarkably dismal publication, but that 1 wished
to gain some insight into the manner in which so much folly and bad
drawing were weekly given to the Public. But the man Samboukre,
who had a somewhat pleasing exterior, could talk of. nothing but
hunting. Silly affectation on the part of a person who earns his
living by making marks on a bit of wood 1 I advised him to talk of
omnibuses or four-wheelers at the outside.
EoirrmD Yates, a spare, slight, closely-bearded man with an
irritating drawl, and a huge appetite, a sure sign of depravity of
mind. He invited me down to his place on the river for a few days,
and I went. He professed to allow me to do as I liked, and I did as
I liked, for whioh 'I was glad, as I could see by his exuberant hos-
pitality that he didn't like it. I find jotted down in my note-book,
Secondrate hired Venetian Bravo or an inferior" pettifogging at-
torney spoilt." Not sorry I went, as my description of his manage
in the Chicago Roarer, under the title of "The Rook in his
Rookery," brought me in a considerable sum of money when it Was
needed.
Last week the elever Russian Police arrested an English Mis-
sionary Clergyman, having " mistaken his Bibles for Nihilist litera*
ture." A little knowledge is a dangerous thing; and the Russian
Detective, who had a smattering of our language, thought he had
got hold of a real plot when he made out the word Revelations."

THE SONG OF THE COUNTEY SQUIRE.
[See Mr. Charles Milneb Gaskell'r Article on " The Country Gentle-
man " in the Nineteenth Century for September 1.]
Air—" The fine Old English Gentleman,"
Now listen, all yon Radicals, and a story I will tell
Of the line Old Country Gentleman, who onoe lived wondrous well,
In the good old times when England's heart was
stout, True Blue, and Tory.
But now, what with Free Trade, Reform Bills,
Rednced Rents, Ground Game Bills, and other
revolutionary rubbish,
It's quite another story
"With the fine Old Country Gentleman, one of the
modern time.
The fine Old Country Gentleman once held a fine
estate,
Of a few thousand acres of farm and forest land,
with polite and punctually-paying tenants, excel-
lent shooting, ancestral oaks, immemorial elms, and all that
sort of thing,
But it hasn't been so of late;
For the rents have gone down' about twenty per cent., lots of acres
are laid down in grass,
And the person who imagines that the Squire of whom Washington
Ibvino and Mounseer Montalembert wrote all sorts of pretty
things has a jolly good time of it in these d etestable days,
Is a sentimental ass,
Says the fine Old Country Gentleman, one of the present time.
The fine Old Country Gentleman has an Elizabethan mansion,
But what the dickens is the good of that if his means continually
narrow in proportion to
His family's expansion?
If he gives up his deer, and sells his timber, dismisses his servants,
and thinks of advertising his house for a grammar school,
Or a lunatic asylum

(As he often has to do) what is there in his lot to excite the jealousy
of those darned Radicals, though the common comfort of that
poor caput lupinum, the Land Owner, on however little a scale
Seems invariably to rile 'em P
Asks the fine Old Country Gentleman, one of the modern time.
With an encumbered property, diminishing rent-roll, and expenses
beyond his income,
The question which confronts him at every corner is, whence will the
needful "tin" come P
And when they prate to us about our " improvidence," and advise
us to "out down" and economise, why, where, in the name of
patience, I ask '11
Be the pull of being a Country Gentleman at all, if one has to live
like a retired pork-butcher or prosperous publican, and perhaps
you will answer
That question Mr. Chables Milnes Gaskell!
Of the fine Old Country Gentleman, one of the modern time.
As to Sport, without which life is not worth an egg-shell, it's be-
coming a ruinous habit,
And soon, no doubt, the darned Radicals '11 rob us of the grouse and
the partridge, as they *ve already
Robbed us of the hare and the rabbit.
Peers and Stockbrokers are popping all over the place, but the
hatred, of Game Laws is gaining,
And before very long I 've no doubt that ratting will be the only
sport remaining
To the fine Old Country Gentleman, one of the modern time.
The results of what Radicals call Reform, and philandering with
foreign parts,
Are rapidly ruining us Country Squires, and breaking our loyal hearts.
And though they compare us Landlords to a one-eyed Polyphemus,
and we are robbed and duped and then derided by that con-
foundedly cunning and conscienceless creature
The Radical Ulysses,
I 'm quite sure that England, which has been going steadily downhill
ever since'32, will descend with one final and fatal dash to the dogs,
As soon as she finally misses
The fine Old Country Gentleman, though of the modern time.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

LIFE AT THE SEA-SIDE.
{By an Outsider.)
With that good fortune which, as we are toldt always attends the
brave, I have been invited by a kind Corporation friend to spend
three or four days with him and his interesting family at this very
paradise of a place. I am forbidden to mention
its name, "On, no, we never mention it," at
least in our correspondence, lest we should be
invaded by the usual swarm of sea-side abomi-
nations. Adah called his Paradise. Eden, so I
should call mine Eden Bridge; but, unless
memory no longer "keeps her place in this
distracted globe," there is already a place so
called. My friend discovered our Eden, last
year, by perfect accident, and has kept his
secret splendidly.
We are, of course, on a somewhat small scale.
We have a nice little Pier on long spider-legs,
and two or three nice little Bathing Machines,
The Sand on the Pier, though they are seldom required, for our nice
little drop of sea runs out so playfully at low
water, and we never have it high, that you can walk straight out for
nearly a mile without wetting your shoulders, and at a distance of a
quarter of a mile we can sit down in the sea and play at chess, as they
do at the baths at Loesch, in Switzerland. One of our special luxuries
is our blue sky. I have been here now for only three days, and seen
more blue sky than I saw in London all last month. We are so fond of
blue that one of our best houses is all blue, blue blinds, blue gates, blue
everything—a fit residence for Neptune himself—and the charming
young ladies of the establishment all wear blue ribbons. Oar public
roads run under overhanging trees, and rustic seats.are placed for the
oomfort of the tired traveller. Here and there are to be seen elegant
little tombs, raised to the memory of departed little dogs, with
touching little epitaphs, such as, "In memory of Towzeb, a Bull
Terrier, Fast and True I" No doubt about it, if he got a chance.
We are quiet; oh, so deliciously quiet. Even the thoughtful
workman pauses in his labour as you pass, fearing the noise might
annoy you. Our little railway never whistles above a whisper, and
always waits ten or fifteen minutes after its time, rather than compel
anybody to hurry.
We are celebrated all over the County for our exquisite flowers,
which blossom in every garden, and bloom in every window. Our
own buxom landlady, the model of what a real Land Lady should be,
is so anxious not to offend any visitor on the ground of his nation-
ality, that she cultivates, in her front garden, the Bose, the
Shamrock, and the Thistle, and I have induced her to send to Wales
for a Leek, having given her a distinct pledge that it flowers beauti-
fully, which I sincerely trust it does.
Our garden is so celebrated, that I sometimes sit at the window
for hours, pretending to read, just to have the pleasure of seeing
all the pretty girls of the plaoe, and I never saw so many elsewhere,
stop as they pass (if that s a thing that can be done), and exclaim
with rapture, " Oh, how beautiful! how handsome! how charming!"
&c.. till I am compelled to leave the window to hide my blushes.
We are strict Sabbatarians. Horses are allowed to be used at
discretion. That is to say, if anybody drives out, he is expeoted to
look as much like an invalid as possible, not a very easy task with
the bronzed faces caused by the sun and the sea. I have heard of one
very conscientious family who always take out an invalid from the
neighbouring Asylum, to condone the offence as it were. Be that as it
may, we strictly draw the line at Donkeys. Where those patient
and useful animals are hidden on Sundays no one has ever discovered.
We have fewer of them here than usual, but I observe they are of
the true American breed, with the stars on their faces and the stripes
on their backs.
We don't seem very large consumers of beef. The careful Butcher
goes round the plaoe on Monday—it does uot take him long—to ascer-
tain what quantity the inhabitants will pledge themselves to take
before deciding to purchasing a whole ox. When he has accom-
plished this, he drives it in triumph down all the four streets, the
same as Mr. Sanger drives his troupe, to give the inhabitants a fore-
taste of their coming joy.
I need hardly say there are no Poor in our Paradise. If you want
anything done, you must make your request known with proper
humility, and behave with becoming liberality. But we are all
eminently loyal; in fact, our loyalty, like the Lohd Mayor's,
approaches the divine. So much so indeed, that a very small hos-
telry, devoted to the supply of fine ales and stout, is dedioated
with becoming humility to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales.
Everything here is ludicrously cheap. You may buy beautiful
household grapes, I think they call them, even in a shop, at the
ridiculous price of three shillings a pound, or from a barrow oppo-
site the door, at one-and-sixpence. Being rather lordly swells after
our fashion, of course no one ever buys at the barrow.
There are no boot-makers in this Elysium, so, presumably, no
corns; but there is one little cobbler's-stall, about ten feet square,
but even here the reigning spirit of beauty finds a place, no less than
a score of cages, each with its singing bird or birds, make the poor
cobbler's-stall a very Babel of sweet sounds.
The good Samaritans of the place sell machines by which you oan
regulate the sunny beam and the whistling wind. With their aid a
cloudless sky is not too hot, nor a gale of wind too strong.
Our streets are kept as neat as a pin and as clean as a whistle—
which, I presume, is always clean. Our one ancient and aristocratic-
looking scavenger, the very image of an illustrious statesman, wheels
his little barrow gently along. We have no dust, as we lay what
little there would otherwise be by a daily supply of sea-water,
which of course seldom dries.
Would I might disclose the name of this earthly Paradise, but
honour forbids, and its commands I obey.

COURAGE AND COMMISSARIAT.
As usual amongst British troops on active service in any part of
the globe, the Egyptian campaign presents innumerable examples
of incomparable valour and endurance. In
particular, by telegram from the Beat of war,
we are told that—
"One proof mentioned by the Duko of Cok-
navght of the spirit of his men was that, for
twenty-four hours after starting from IsmaiUa, they
had nothing served out to them; yet, hungry,
thirsty, worn-out as they were, dirty and unahaved,
they were most anxious to bo led forward against
the enemy."
This anxiety on the part of our gallant fel-
lows of course simply and solely evidenced a
combative inclination, coupled with a desire _ ■* Left-tenant,
to do their duty, superior to depressing circumstances, and to
get it over and feed as soon as possible. Quite right too. "Dirty
and unwashed"—did the Duke, or the Correspondent who seems
to be quoting H.ll.H.'s words, expect the men to be as neat
and trim as when on parade Y Other soldiers, similarly situated,
might also possibly evince a longing to be led against the enemy;
but that would merely betray impatience, and show them simply
tired of their lives. Though not always shorn and pipeclayed
for duty in Pall Mall, our own heroes are never too untidy for
action; and, alike whether hungry and thirsty or replete with
rations, they uniformly exhibit an indomitable and unbounded
stomach for the fight. More might be said, but that foreigners
would perhaps pretend to mistake it for brag, apparently a little
too like blowing our own trumpet. Besides, the question ohiefly
suggested by the statement that our men had to fight upon empty
stomachs is, obviously,—who ought to be hanged?

Who stands on the steps of

So dimpled, bewitching,

So graceful and gleesome—
a princess of pets,

Who puts all her trust

She dives with a splash in

And makes the shore glad
with her laughter and

The cliffs all re-echo her

Her heart it is light and her

She floats and she paddles
and swims round the bay,
And comes back to rest
at her Buoy!
Ah! "ooming events cast
their shadows before!"

The Rule for a Criterion Success, proved to demonstration by one
or, at most, two rare exceptions, is that Mr. Charles Windham

member, at this theatre. Mis* Muffet-

tating pieoe, because
you go so deter-
mined to laugh at

done at the Criterion,
and so glad to get
the opportunity for
a laugh in the " dull
season." that, as
scene follows scene,
and actors, who
have_ been so amusing in other parts and other pieces, are visibly
playing their very best, and scarcely making any soore to speak
of, even a favourably prejudiced audienoe is unable to repress
its disappointment. In Paris, the whole point of the piece, as we
remember being informed at the time, when advised, if we had any-
thing better to do, not to waste an evening on La Femme a Papa,
•was Jtmic's impersonation' of the ingenue who gets tipsy. This, of
course, sounds charmingly inviting, but having witnessed the exhibi-
tion that Mme. Schneider ohose to make of herself in La Pirichole,
and having once again sat out a weak imitation of that performance,
we very easily found something better to do than assist at La
Femme a Papa,
The idea of the old rout father, who is a disgrace to his striotly
moral and deeply studious son, is still fresh in the memory of all
who saw Charles Mathews, inimitable to the last, in My Awful
Bad; and on the working out of this idea, muddled up with the
other less funny and some not-funny-at-all ideas, depends the suc-
cess of the piece which the adapter of Pink Dominos (Les Dominos
Poses) has, with Mr. Wtndham's assistance as reviser and Stage
Manager, brought out at the Criterion. Mr. Windham made a
mistake over Foggarty's Fairy, which ought to
have been the libretto for our true humorist in
music, Abthdb, Sullivan,
and he has made another with
this. In the Fairy he played
himself, but the part didn't
suit him, the piece didn't suit
the audience, and nothing
could save it: but in Miss
Muffet, if he had played the
part which Mr. Beerbohme
Tree works so hard to make
effective, and with which he
really does his utmost, though
it is not in the least in his
line—except just at the com-
mencement—Mr. Windham
might have achieved a Pieoe
with Honour, even though he had not obtained a triumph.
Nobody, except in a limited theatrical circle, as a rule, cares one

A GLORIOUS VICTORY.
It was a summer evening,
Old Roger's work was done,
And he his fragrant honey-dew
Was smoking in the sun,
And by him sported, bright and fair,
His little grandchild, Golden II a tit. •
She saw her brother, Curly Head,
Bring something hard and round
Which he, upon the mantel-shelf,
Beneath a shade, had found.
She came to ask what he had found
That was so hard, and smooth, and round.
Old Roger took it from the boy
Who stood expectant by,
And then the old man told the tale—
(Fire kindled in his eye)—
"This is the Crioket-Ball," said he,
"That tells of a great Victory.
"1 prize it more than all I have,
It's worth can ne'er be told;
'lis true 'tis only leather, but
'Tis more to me than gold 1
Go, place it back again, said he,—
"It was a famous Victory."
"Please tell us what it is you mean,"
Young Curly Head he cries;
And little Golden Haie looks up
With wonder-waiting eyes:—
"Yes, tell us, for we long to know
The reason why you prize it so."
"It was the Colonists," he said,
"Of now undying fame,
Who met Eleven picked Englishmen
And put them all to shame:
For everybody said," quoth he,
"That 'twas a famous Victory.
"The contest at the Oval was—
The noted ground hard by—
'Twas there that Spofforth smashed the stnmpp,
And made the bails to fly;
But things like that, you know, must be
At every famous Viotory.
"Not even Grace, of matchless skill
(No worthier in the land),
The ' Demon's' onslaughts could resist,
His awful speed withstand;
By lightning smit, as falls the oak,
The wickets fell beneath his stroke!
"And more than twenty thousand men,
With bated breath, looked on—
The threatening rain deterred them not,
Nor did the scorching sun;
Their time and money gave to see
Who 'd gain the famous Viotory.
"And when at last the crisis came—
When one must quickly yield—
When Peate, the famous Yorkshireman,
His wicket failed to shield,
All over was the splendid play—
The Englishmen had lost the day I
"They say it was a wondrous sight,
After the match was done.
To see so many thousand men
After the Viotors run;
But things like that, you know, must be
At every famous Victory.
"Great praise the ' Demon' Spofporth gained,
His bowling was so rare."
"1 think he must have frightened them,"
Said little Golden Hair.
"Well, well, my little girl," quoth he,
"It was a famous Viotory!
"And everyone the ' Demon' cheered,
So many low he laid"
"But what could they be all about
To let him T" Curly said:
"Why that—I cannot tell," said he;

THE ANONYMOUS LETTER-WRITER.
A SERIOUS MUDDLE.
A "Serious Young Man" is greatly exercised by the subjoined passages
in a speech delivered, according to the Hampshire Independent, at the late
Annual Meeting of the Southern Unitarian Association, held at Newport, I. W.
—Subject, "The need of urging the claims of Christianity on the people."
In the course of his remarks, as reported, the speaker, questioning the tactics
of the Salvation Army, said:—
"If Christianity was to be really aggressive, it muat not spend itself in mere excite-
ment, or cramp itself within the limits of narrow dogmas. It must be wide and open,
teaching such doctrines as the fatherhood of God, the brotherhood of man, and a strong
belief in immorality." (Sic.)
The "Serious Young Man" had always understood that the Unitarians.
however sadly in error as to their peculiar principles, were, in point of moral
doctrine, at any rate, a respectable body. He had ever supposed them altogether
the reverse of Antinomians; or, as he has heard an old lady say, Antimonials,
and never dreamt that not only did they profess Antinomianism, or Anti-
monialism, but pushed it to the extent of actually inculcating immorality.
He had lately had an idea of joining the Salvation Army; an inclination
which was very much strengthened by finding the method of that Soldiery
represented by an Unitarian as opposed to a belief in immorality.
Of course, the Serious Young Man is dumbfounded simply by immortality
without a T. (No paradise for a Teetotaller.) He fails to perceive that
misprints will occur in the best edited newspapers.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Householder, in Full-Armed Evening Dbess, preparing to
receive burglars. "no place like home!"
A LITTLE HOLIDAY.
Happy-Thought Notei in Wales—Still at Olwanffai Castle—Pre-
paring for the Eisteddfod—A Musical and Intellectual Evening.
I hake a point of attempting to remedy my previous mistake, by
inducing the Bardie Professor, Edward Edwards, "the Soaring
Eagle"—(cannot help recalling Hiawatha and The Last of the
Mohicans)—to give me all the information possible about the coming
Eisteddfod.
Were we alone with our host, Wynevan, who. having to preside
at one of the Festival meetings is, I feel sure, deeply interested in
collecting the best materials possible for his speech, interesting and
instructive conversation would now easily enough. We two would
put leading questions to the Welsh Harpist, and draw him out.
But this style of thing is quite impossible when Miss GRiLLsrow,
Christian name, Mabel, a decidedly handsome young lady of mascu-
line character, sporting tone, and independent opinions, and Johnnie
Pkosser are present. They haven't, between them, the slightest
reverence for a Bard of any sort. Apart, they are reasonable beings,
and can talk calmly, rationally, and sensibly on any topio; but once
together, serious conversation in their presence is impracticable.
\ Happy Thought.—Simile. They are like the two wire points of
an electric light: separated—quiescent: united—bang! N.B.—Ishall
compile a small handbook ou similes. Nothing so useful and orna-
mental in general conversation as good similes. The similes most in
use are deficient either in applicability or perspicuity. For example,
What is conveyed by "Like one o'clock?" e.g., "He bolted like
one o'clock; he danced like one o'clock." Again: "He looked as
melancholy as a bear with a sore head." How many of those who
hear or use this simile have ever seen a bear under this affliction?
Experience has taught us all the utter falsity of the supposed
resemblance between a violent lunatic and a hatter. Perhaps one
question on this point has never been put,—namely, when a hatter
does go mad, is he invariably more dangerous than a lunatic of any
other trade or profession P "Drunk as a Lord" is decidedly unfair.
Having thoroughly considered this subject, I have determined to
write a handy-volume of similes for the waistcoat-pocket, diamond
edition, alphabetically arranged, so that in the middle of a conversa-
tion any one can retire to the window, or pretend to look at the
clock, and, instead, consult his Diamond Edition of Similes, extract
something brilliant, pocket the little book, turn round, rejoin the
conversation, startle them with a brilliant simile, and then take his
hat and go. If conversation were always conducted on this plan,
with my forthcoming diamond edition in the pockets of the majority,
life would be, as far as dialogue went, one long Sheridan-like
Comedy, and Mr. Mallook's query as to its being "worth living"
would be satisfactorily answered. Evidently, there is a demand for
this sort of thing, only nobody knows exactly what is wanted. Once
tell 'em, and they '11 Bee it, and jump at it.]
[Happy Thought.—Supply a want. Will carefully write down
similes. Have small side-pocket made in waistcoat for simile note-
book. Call it The New Similia Similibus Book.]
During dinner I try to get all the information I can about national
Welsh customs and Eisteddfods from the Bard. He is full of the
subject, but directly he settles down to it, and becomes earnest and
interesting, so that I am, as it were, "sitting at his feet" or
"hanging on his lips,"— [N.B.—Similia Similibus Book. Wanted,
similes for both these expressions—the first has something to do with
Gamaliel or Galileo, and the Becond is connected with bees and
a philosopher.... work these out]—Johnnie Prosseb cuts in with
some idiotic question, or Miss Mabel makes some frivolous remark,
which interferes with the flow of the Bard's eloquence, and he politely
pauses to answer, quite seriously, first one, then the other, so that
when I want him to resume his instruction it is very difficult to
bring him back to the exact point where he left off. I am sure that
Mr. Alfred Tennyson himself would fare no better with these two
companions than doeB the Bard, as on my drawing Johnnie and Miss
Mabel's attention to the well-known pioture of the eminent
Laureate, faithfully represented (by an equally eminent Artist), in a
long cloak with a brigand-like kind of shapeless wideawake sur-
mounting his long ragged locks, on the dining-room wall, I solemnly
ask Miss Mabel what she would say to the Great Poet were he
present now, her immediate reply is, "Say? I should ask him
when he last had his hair cut,"—which I think would rather startle
Alfred the Great. Johnnie Prosseb, with a horsey kind of bit-of-
straw-in-the-mouth shake of the head, immediately remarks that,
for his part, he should inquire " if he were a walking advertisement
for the 3Ianleaux Noirs at the Avenue Theatre P "—which question,
unfortunately for the Laureate at this moment, being so evidently
suggested by the picture, would be safe to raise a furtive titter at
the great man's expense. "And, perhaps," says Johnnie, "unless
the old boy "—bo he irreverently terms the Laureate—" is a very
obstinate cuss, he might at once go oil to his tailor's—or somebody
else's (somebody else s would be better)—and appear next day in a
brand-new up-to-the-time-of-day suit, with top-hat to match;
and if he insisted on still sticking to a cloak in the evening when
swaggering into the Stalls at the Gaiety or the Comedy, he could start
one of a new style, and call it the Nineteenth Century Wrapper."
After this I look towards the Bard, Professor Edward Edwards.
"The Soaring Lion." compassionately, as much as to Bay, "There I
If they 'd say such things of the Laureate, you can see what you 've
got to expect!"
Seizing the first occasion when I think that the light-hearted
pair are engaged on some other topio, I quietly ask the Bard if
the Eisteddfod is confined entirely to Welshmen, having heard him
mention the names of certain well-known musicians as taking part
in the ceremony, who were decidedly not Welsh. He begins to
explain—slowly—as if he were bringing up heavy artillery whioh
would blow all objections to atoms when it arrived—[N.B.—Similia
Similibus Book—note—Letter A—Arguments—Answers—Artillery
. . . . see under H . . . . Heavy]—and while he is moving up his
guns, the mounted sharpshooters rush out of their ambush, and don't
give him a chance.
"All Welshmen singing!" exclaims Johnhie Pbossee. "Isn't
Lloyd a Welsh name?"
"Yes," replies the Bard, clearly pleased at the interest thus
unexpectedly shown. "And Edward Lloyd sings at the Concert."
"Oh!" says Johnnie, "I was thinking of Arthur Lloyd. Why
don't you have him down ?—Draw tremendously."
The Soaring Eagle, with that modesty which characterises true
Genius, appears hurt that he is unacquainted with such a musical
celebrity as Mr. Arthur Lloyd evidently is. "Is he," he wishes to
know, "a tenor?"
"Tenner!" repeats Johnnie, of course wilfully misunderstanding,
and choosing to treat the proposed engagement as a matter of busi-
ness. "You wouldn't get him down all this way under a pony and
exs. paid, for a couple of nights."
"They haven't anything so lively as that," says Miss Mabel.
"I like ' We are a Merry Family,' and 'Tidings of Comfort and
Joy'—that's very funny."
Those are Arthur Roberts's," interposes Johnnie Prosseb,
thoroughly resenting such ignorance on the part of Miss Grillston,
who accepts the correction, observing that " she knew it was Arthur
some one or other," a contemptuous indifference which threatens
to throw quite a gloom over Johnnie Prosseb. The Bard's face
wears a puzzled expression as he puts his finger to his forehead,
and tries to connect the titles of the songs, and the names of the
singers he has just heard mentioned, with anything in his own
artistic experiences.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I cannot help asking, "Bat, Miss Gbillston, when did you
hear"
"Oh, I suppose you think it '• horridly improper?" she begins,
laughing. 1 hasten to assure her that such a thought was far, &c,
&o. "But," she continues, indicating Pkosser with her fan,
"Johnnie knows. My brother Hughie sings them all, so does
Freddie Mickham. 'Do you know Fbeddie Mickham?" No, I regret
to say. "Oh, I thought everyone knew Fbeddie, and J. B. You
know 'J. B.' of course." Not to be out of it this time, I say that I
"don't know him personally; but know of him." Which is perfeotly
true, all my knowledge of him, haying just come to me from Miss
-Mabel, in whose good opinion, my admission, accompanied on my
part by a mysterious nod, and artful closing of my eyes, goes far to
re-establish me. "Ah! of course you know of him. Well, J. B.
plays the accompaniments."
They 're all coming this evening," adds Jounnie Pkosser,
nodding pleasantly at the Bard, as if promising him a real intellec-
tual and musical treat; "and you '11 De able to hear 'em. They 're
Al."
All hopes of. obtaining any information from the Eisteddfodian
Professor now vanish. After dinner there is just one more chance as
we light a cigarette, but there is a sudden noise in the hall, wild
shouts of triumph, as though the Castle had been surprised and
taken by victorious Kerns who are giving vent to their joy in
hunting-whoops, blasts on the coach-horn, and the banging of
savage gongs.
In another second the dining-room door is burst open, and, scarcely
giving our host time to exclaim, "Hallo, Hughie !—hallo, Fbeddie!
—hallo, J. B.!" three young men in evening dress, the last carrying
a gong and a hunting-horn, rush into the room, and testify to the ex-
uberance of their delight at seeing their "old pal," Johnnie Pbosser,
once more (they haven't met for two days) by rushing at him with
whoops' and howls, their immediate object, apparently, being a
violent assault on his white tie, which Johnnie has to defend with
the utmost vigour. "They always have what they call a bear-fight
when they meet," my host explains to me, hopelessly. "But," he
goes on, seeing that the Bard is gliding towards the door, and I am
following him, "it's only among themselves." The Bard, not being
entirely reassured, retires to the drawing-room. The Bears gradually
subside, betaking themselves to separate mirrors to put themselves
to-rights again. After this, becoming more composed, they are
introduced as Hughie Gbillston, brother of Miss Mabel, Fbeddie
Mick ham, "his friend," as they used to describe "Charles" in
the dramatis persona of plays, and Mr. Jos. Beamly, commonly
known among his intimates as " J. B.," great at the piano in the
singing and comic-song-accompaniment line.
All have come over from somewhere—they none of them seem very
clear as to where they have come from, and are all, apparently, stay-
ing with one another,—for the Eisteddfod, being, evidently, just the
very men to be deeply and reverentially interested in Old National
Customs, Bardio Ceremonies, and Eisteddfodian Music
Our hostess and host have arranged for a recital on the harp by
the Professor, and for a variety of high-class music furnished by the
guests, who have arrived from all parts, as a prelude to to-morrow's
Eisteddfod; but somehow, after the Bard has concluded his harp
recital, which is listened to with rapt attention by everyone except the
bear-fighters, who remain in the outer hall, and, under the vigilant
eye of the host, carry on an intermittent warfare with noiseless sofa-
cushions, and after a lady has sung a melancholy ditty, with a refrain
about " 0 my Fond One! 0 my Lost One!" which sets one of the
Freddies, or Hughles, or Johnnies off with a sotto voce imitation
of a cat, immediately suppressed by the frown of the hostess (at the
door), the warning snake of the host's head, and a couple of unne-
cessary reminders with flying bolsters launched vigorously but
surreptitiously by "J. B.," at the probable offender's head, we
suddenly find ourselves bounding into the mazy dance, the hostess
having yielded to Miss Mabel's representations about "everyone
wanting it, but afraid to ask," and as " J. IS." prefers playing the
piano to dancing, the next thing I see is the Bard himself led out
by Miss Mabel, who will take no denial, and who whirls him round
to a tune which Johnnie tells me is Whisht! whisht! whisht.'
You (something) always catch 'em with a Whisht! whisht! whisht!"
and I there and then give up all hope of any information about
to-morrow's Eisteddfod until I actually take part in it, which, by
the way, the Bard himself has told me he has to do in some official
character, at a very early hour, something like eight a.ic.
To-night we forget all about the Eisteddfod. The heat is intense.
We all saunter out into the moonlight. After this, as the papers
aay, "dancing was kept up with much spirit until a late hour."
The guests depart .... cheers, tears, and laughter .... whoops,
hoorayings, and hornblowings .... our host retires .... more
bear-fightings in connection with the billiard-table and sofas, in
which, I have a sort of indistinct idea, the Bard joins. Lemons—
whiskeys—pipes—cigars—da capo. Somebody observes, "the last
Saraband has been danced in the hall"—when Johnnie asks what
sort of a thing a Saraband is, whereupon Hughie, Fbeddie, and
J. B. insist on showing him. Spirited resistance on Johnnie's part,
resulting in general collapse of everybody on sofas. More whiskeys
(without lemons), pipes, ic. Somebody is left asleep in the hall, it
being charitably considered by everyone a pity to wake him. Blaoking
his face is proposed, but no one feels inclined to fetch a cork, and
the process of burning it at a candle would take, it is very generally
felt, a considerable time. So we decide on going to bed. The
floors being highly polished and slippery, renders holding on by the
balustrade fixed to the wall, absolutely necessary.
"Hate polished floors!" says Johnnie Pbosser, who is gently
allowing his wax-candle to melt all on one side, and dropping, like
the gentle rain from Heaven, on Fbeddie's coat-tails, who is just
before him on the staircase.
"Hang these rugs!" growls "J. B.," as one slips away from
under his foot, and he recovers his equilibrium with an effort that
has given him, he is afraid, a sprain in his back for life.
Happy Thought.—Get clear of them: t'other side of staircase,
which in this ancient Castle is licensed to carry at least ten abreast.
Say nothing except " Good night!" quietly, and creep down passage
to bed. On the landing, where they are on a comparatively safe
footing, they cannot resist commencing a last short but decisive
bear-fight demonstration, which, however (I see from my dark retreat
down the passage) is brought to an ignominious collapse by the
appearance of the host in a dressing-gown, who, in a stage-whisper,
says something—and evidently meaning it—about "Confounded
noise—wake everybody—be off!"—whereupon the oonvioted Bears
slink down different passages, and disappear to their dens, the doors
of which are just heard mysteriously closing, one after another, in
the distance.
And this is the prelude for the Great Eisteddfod to-morrow
morning! Where's the Bard? Who was it asleep on the sofa?
. . . . Wonder who he was Wind watch What
night lights they are—no, I mean what light nights these are—in
Wales Dear me — just on four .... Eisteddford — simile

THE SUEZ CANAILLE;
Or, a Utile more Contemporary History—according to Victor dc Lcsseps.
• •••••
Aitd now arrived the supreme moment when the brigands were about
to depart. We had heard the last fatal news. 1 had sent the
invaders this message—"This is an act of butchers."
But my august father was not wanting to the occasion. He had
round his neck a false collar of English make. He did not hesitate
for a moment. He tore it off, and danced on it. This was his
response to the insolence of the invader.
We were celebrating the birthday of one of our coal-porters as
usual with, an appropriate fete. Europe was splendidly represented.
But at this moment there arose a succession of piercing shrieks
from the defenceless ones of our community. With perfect presence
of mind, I prepared to face this new manifestation. I retired hur-
riedly to my official bureau, and, locking the door, instituted through
the keyhole a searching inquiry. The truth was soon established.
Ho-tins, under protection of his huge monsters on the Canal, had
again invaded our sanctity. This time he had come with a horse-
whip, two metres and a half in length,—"un vrai Epsome," as he
insolently boasted,—and with this abominable instrument he had
lashed the little defenceless innocents, who fled from his path, terri-
fied by his long red whiskers and protruding foreteeth, with a
ferocity of Han uniquely British. The mothers protested. They
were instantly cut down in carnage, amid brutal jests, by his bleu-
jacquette myrmidons. But, with a magnificent and dignified calm,
my father again intervened. He met the barbaric act with a diplo-
macy that left no margin for further inquietudes.
"The admission," he said, "to these gardens is fourpence, whioh
can be taken out in refreshments. You have no ticket. You have
violated international law."
To this logic, clear and unanswerable, the brigand Hosktks made
an arrogant rejoinder. My father threatened the Company's ulti-
matum, but the next instant Wolseley was advancing with his
victorious cut-throats on the other side. The personnel of the Canal
had to be preserved at any cost. With indescribable sang froid my
father, securing the books of the Company, took up his position in
the Safe. •—#.**-
In a few minutes the invaders were thronging the streets, blowing
up the gas-pipes with dynamite, and firing heavy pieces of ordnance
into the drawing-room windows in mere wanton sport, as they
marched along. All were loaded with loot of the costliest descrip-
tion. Even common soldiers had their boots stuffed with valuable
articles of jewellery. I saw one Captain on horseback so loaded
with household effects and^f orniture, that the legs of his poor beast,
bent at a painful angle with the weight, refused at last to move.
His rider was Fitzrot, who annoyed me so much in the commence-
ment of the campaign.
A final incident, and I have done. Staggering on their way
towards the loading-stage, in an incessant stream, came endless
thousands of porters, carrying on their backs huge blocks, done up
in brown paper, and addressed to the "Lord Mayor." I asked an
explanation. It was the entire Great Pyramid being taken away
"to pave It Piccadilly." 31. Le Due Tech, who was to have a
commission on the enterprise, had taken advantage of his offioial
position as General-in-Chief of Field Correspondence, to send the
whole of it to England, by the new Parcels Post, free of charge.
Such are the outrages with which we are familiar. But we shall
endeavour, as heretofore, to meet them with a sublime calm.

THE SPENDTHRIFTS GUIDE.—No. VI.
The most favourite form of money-wasting in England—and
probably in other oountries—is the brick, stone, and mortar form.
There are spendthrift Companies who insist upon building Aqua-
riums in places that do not require Aquariums, with Directors who
are more fishy than the fish, and dividends that are suggestive of
low water. There are people who build gigantic hotels in places
that have no local population, and no power of attracting visitors;
and there are people who build mansions in places that have all the
disadvantages of the country, and none of its advantages. There
are people who build Muddle-lodging-houses that never Tiave been,
and never will be, occupied by the olasses they were intended to
benefit; and there axe people who build Colleges and Hospitals for
one purpose, that are persistently devoted to another. Capital has
been lavishly wasted in many eooentric shapes, but not to any
extent, in Museums. There is a great field for enterprise in Mu-
seums. The Spendthrift could hardly do much better with his time
and money than invest them in a Museum of a perfectly novel type,
which he might properly call the Museum of National Disgrace.
England is a great country. There is a tradition that the buh never
Bets within its dominions. It clings to "Rule, Britannia.'" it glories
in National Debts, and it has an infinite power of taxation. The
centre of England is London, said to be the richest, as it certainly is
the greatest city in the world. Its greatness is shown in a popula-
tion of four millions: its riches are disgraced by a hundred oases of
starvation a year. These cases are not all reported, or, if reported,
are disguised under the headings of "privation," "exposure,"
"neglect," &o. The reporters are naturally ashamed to tell the
truth, and probably the public are glad that they are not compelled
to read it. With all our affected love of pubhoity, there is much
that we agree to conceal from ourselves, and from each other.
The Spendthrift will take a tract of land as near the offices of
Government as possible. On this he will raise a building regardless
of expense, prepared to receive a countless number of statues. The
moment any death from starvation occurs, he will obtain a cast of
the body, and from this he will raise a life-like representation of the
miserable dead, and place it on a pedestal, with the name, age, cause
of death, and every other particular. The parish in whioh the death
occurred, the amount of poor-rate levied in that parish, the name of
the beadle who refused food at the workhouse gateB, the name of the
policeman who thought that the dead man or woman was drunk, and
every disgraceful act of Bumbledom should be recorded, not in a
register, but in large letters on the base of the statue, lighted by the
eleotrio light. The Spendthrift should be prepared for a thousand
aotions for libel a year. The more the merrier. Before the Museum
of National Disgrace has been opened for three or four years, the
annual cases of "exposure" wilt have sensibly diminished. The
space at the Spendthrift's disposal can easily be utilised. A small
hall for the statues of persons murdered bymurderers never dis-
covered will form a well-filled '' Chamber of Horrors " in this much-
needed Museum.

PITY THE SORROWS OF A POOR PRINCE!
(To the Editor o/Punch.)
Sib,—As the era of doing justice and restoration appears to have
dawned, judging from the recent truly liberal and noble act of
the present Liberal Government, headed, by the great Gladstone
the Just, I am encouraged to lay before the British nation, through
the medium of Punch, the injustice whioh I have suffered in the
hope that, although generosity may not be lavished upon me to the
same extent as has been bestowed, upon King Cetkwayo, yet some
magnanimity might be shown towards me by this great and grand
old Empire.
I was known as " the child of destiny," and, as I was deserted at
my birth, I have no reasonable doubt out what I was the true heir
to the throne of the Cannibal Islands. I have been dispossessed of
that throne, although I was little better than an infant at the time
when my claims were ignored. I did not urge that I should be
restored, because I have no wish to deprive Her Majesty of a
subject to whom she has shown unbounded graciousness. On more
than one occasion she, in her own glorious name, has personally
requested me to pay certain sums of money to others of her subjects.
Such signal condescension has filled me with gratitude and admiration.
My case is precisely similar to what the Khedive's is at this
moment, Ababi being in his present position to his master what a
gentleman, name unknown, was to me—viz., a rebel. At last, very
tardily, the British Government have sent troops to quell Arabi. I
don't ask for troops to be sent to the Cannibal Islands, because my
affection to the British Throne is too great for words. Moreover, at
the Cannibal Islands, even as its King, I should be treated as a
"Nigger," and although shown much official respect, would be
regarded of infinite less importance than the meanest European that
ever swept a crossing. Under these circumstances, I would far
sooner stay in England than travel beyond the seas.
I will not trouble you with the details of my case, or say a word
in disparagement of the late Duke of Wellington, the present Mr.
Chamberlain, and the other celebrities whose (till now) honoured
names have got mixed up with 'my history. I will merely refer you
to the State Papers preserved in the National Museum of the
Cannibal Islands for further information.
I would merely say :—
1. That 1 have been most unjustly deprived of my kingdom,
yielding (I think) in 1850 some £500,000, and now, no doubt, far
more valuable.
2. That the Crown Jewels of the Cannibal Islands have been sold
without my consent, although, had I been consulted (such is my
veneration for my Most Gracious Sovereign that I would not hurt a
hair of her sacred head), 1 would willingly have disposed of them
myself, as a temporary measure, yielding up to the proper Authori-
ties the tickets serving as the documentary evidence of the pledge,
and thus enabling them to be recovered and resold on most advan-
tageous terms.
3. That all my personal property has been taken from me on the
occasion of a State visit to one of Her Most Gracious Majesty's
prisons, although those who had accompanied me, and who had a
business relationship with me, were treated with a leniency utterly
in disproportion to their de-merits.
In return I have received a meagre allowance at times from the
relieving officer, whioh has been reduced by certain charges (known
to the proper Authorities) on the score that I had had it in advance!
Generous British Public, accord me a just and liberal treatment
for the sake of the fair name of our nation, for assuredly it is more
honourable to give than to take! _
In conclusion, I may mention (in confidence) that I shall he glad
to commute my claims to the Crown of the Cannibal Islands, my
right to the State Jewels, and my lien on every epeoies of personal
property, for the ridiculously small sum of one-and-eightpenoe-
halfpenny! x j^ ihe honour to remailli sir,

JAVA REDUCED TO JELLY.
{By our Chaffanese Young Man.)
Zazel and the Tattooed Greek Nobleman have given place at the
Royal Westminster Aqnarium to "the Javanese Gamelan." They
are now exhibiting in the annexe, over the tank in which Miss
Beckwith was wont to pass her monotonous days, floating slowly
round and round to the dance-music of a cottage-piano. Apparently,
to judge from the " Notes compiled for the Private Rehearsal" of these
Ladies and Gentlemen, the only person who knows anything about
them is Sir Stamfohd Raffles, and even the knowledge of this
world-renowned celebrity has its limits. "Raffles," (as the Notes
familiarly call Sir Stamford) in an "address to the Batavian
Sooiety," admitted that language was his chief obstacle to learning
their history. "Dntch, and Europeans generally, communicate with
them through ignorant interpreters, and these themselves speaking a
much mixed-up and corrupt language, intercommunication becomes
doubly difficult." However, the baffled "Raffles," seemingly,
discovered that the chief poems of the Javanese were the Wayang
Purvoo and the Wayang Gedog, whioh " are held by the Javanese of
the present day in about the same estimation as the Iliad and
Odyitey of Homer are by Europeans." No doubt the "obstacle"
already alluded to stood in the way of a thorough comprehension of
these classics, so "Raffles" (or the Compiler of the Notes) is only
able to testify "to the power of the language, and the genius of the
Poet, " with the discouraging qualification, "as far as we can judge
from the partial translations which have been made from them
through the medium of the modern Javanese." It is to witness a
performance of the Wayang Parwo and Wayang Gedog that the
British Publio are invited by the Management to come to the West-
minster Aquarium.
The troop oonsists of about a dozen Men and four young Women—
the latter, seemingly, to judge from their appearance, not even now too
old to join a junior-class in a preparatory infant Bchool. The men
of the party were seated in front of what appeared to be a number of
covered saucepans. In the centre was a lad with a two-Btringed

\s^

fiddle, playing carefully out of tune. Occasionally the other per-
formers thumped the lids of their saucepans. After listening to the
"music " for three minutes, it is easy to believe the Compiler of the
Notes "that there is no notation for Javanese musio, and in the
absence of any published study of the musical system, it is difficult
to say what it is." As a guess, one might venture to suggest that
the music" resembles the noise made by the kitchen utensils of a
Margate steamer in a storm, relieved by the distant knell of a ceme-
tery bell out of repair.
The Wayang Parwo was being performed. Three of the young
Women were stalking round the stage in a circle, occasionally nod-
ding their heads and moving their hands up and down, as if they
were making some preliminary flourishes before performing a con-
juring trick. This continued for a few ^ minutes, when they were
joined by a Gentleman in a flannel shirt and a bath towel. The
flannel shirt had linen wristbands, and the gentleman wore a Euro-
pean watch and chain. Here it may be remarked that the costumes
generally were disappointing. The circular convening the meeting
had promised that the clothing "would interest those who give
attention to aesthetic dreBs." However, there was nothing parti-
cularly aesthetic or interesting in a wardrobe equally suggestive of the
oast-off garments of an economical provincial Othello who had " to
find his own dresses," and the oontents of the shop of a cheap hosier
attempting to establish himself, not very successfully, in a back
street near the Fulham Road. But this is a detail. The Ladies
oontinued their prowl, and the Gentleman, turning his hack upon
them, assumed attitudes, now reminding one of the Courier of
St. Petersburg in a Circus, and now of a nipped-in-the-bud Nigger
breakdown. The Ladies occasionally screamed, and finally joined
hands in twos and twos. Then a couple leisurely sat down, while
the others continued their monotonous walk alone. By this time the
Gentleman was exhausted. So he wiped his face, looked at his
watch, and motioned "the orchestra" to stop their clatter. Thus
ended the Wayang Purtco.
At the Private Rehearsal here came a pause for refreshments,
when those present were offered "chicken and champagne." The
Javanese, however, did not join in the collation, their modest wants
being fully satisfied by a few pots of beer. Then came the per-
formance of the Wayang Gedog, which might be aptly translated,
as " it is taken from the history of Pakje, the most renowned
hero of Java story"
(again the Notes
are quoted), ae the
Wayward Sly Dog.
Three Ladies, once
more keeping time
to the musio of
the saucepans and
screech-fiddle,
began their mono-
tonous stroll. Anew
Gentleman, whose
"aesthetic dress"
consisted of a white
cook's jacket and
brown cloth un-
mentionables (as
what they exactly
were—I mean what
he exactly wore—I
am unable to des-
cribe),joined them.
He moved forward very deliberately, with steps measuring
some three inches a-piece, until he approached close to one of the
Ladies. Jhen he leisurely chucked her under the chin, and slowly
retired. This "doggish" manoeuvre was repeated two or three times,
and the Wayang Gedog, described in the programme as " the true
Oriental Dance of rhythmic movements (commonly known as the
Nautch) " was over. To the Philistine accustomed to a very different
measure (watched at the Pantomime houses), it appeared neither
"Nauchty " nor nice!
The performers, both players and dancers, seemed extremely
good-natured, and smiled occasionally, apparently moved to mild
mirth at the rapt attention given by the audience to their feeble efforts
at Terpsichorean tomfoolery. In the circular it was explained that
"the usual caste scrupleB which prevent many Orientals leaving
their native land, do not apply in this case, as these natives of Java
are descendants of those who were driven to embrace Mahometanism."
This little piece of information was all the more interesting, as the
ancestors of these natives (to quote from the Notes) "were com-
pelled at the sword'B point to embrace Mahometanism in 1874." Or
more than five hundred years ago!
To sum up. The exhibition ib dull in the extreme, and a single
visit will be enough {if, indeed, not more than enough) to satisfy
the most inveterate of sightseers. It is true that one of those
Sresent at the Private Rehearsal expressed his opinion that "the
ancing was too good for the public," and another that "the
orchestra" were playing "some exoellent concerted music." In
spite of all this, however, a last quotation of the programme is
desirable. Says the programme, "Ethnologists, Musicians, and
Art-Connoisseurs will find this visit of Javanese affords an unusually
favourable opportunity for study." This is quite true, as the
attractiveness of the Gamelan is unlikely to divert the attention of
Ethnologists, Musicians, and Art-Connoisseurs from the study of—
something else!
Beal Police Intelligence!

This is the sort of person whom the
Folico taw loafing: about for weeks, and
never watched because they " thought
he teas a betting man!" About as
close a resemblance as he bears to St.
Leger himself.

Oh, how shall I hazard a hint of it ?—marriage I
Oh, where shall I venture what, burning to blab,
I have tried to bring in, but in vain, in a carriage,
And longed to lead up to. but failed, in a cab r—
She smiles, she is kind, ana 'tis hard, at each parting,
To be left thus of Love to the last in the lurch,
When I 've dreamed of it, screamed from a train, just at starting,
And mused of it, murmured to music in Church.
We flew through the foam in the yacht-dotted harbour,
No use—I was mute, though we dodged the same sail!
No go—though alone in the dark garden-arbour!
On horseback, as bad—in a boat, no avail!
Nay, when once we were wedged, tete-d-tele, in a hansom,
I had found, you had fancied, my ohance—I was dumb!
And the words were unsaid, had you staked a life's ransom
'Gainst the sound that one makes with one's finger and thumb 1
In vain, should I write it—what aid were a letter,
Were it all, to her face, to say over again?
Were it faltered in French—would it sound any better?
In Oerman ?—I 'm certain she 'd bid me explain!
Still it is not, don't think, that I fear to offend her;
Indeed, of her feelings I 've hardly a doubt;
I am simply so shy, and her sighs are so tender,
I tremble, turn nervous, and can't get it out!
So here by the side of the sail-sprinkled ocean
I mope on the bathing-boxed, boat-cumbered shore;
She is here, too, I hear, but By George, I 've a notion!
Eureka! I 've solved it—I '11 suffer no more!
'Tis her glanoe that embarrasses—none could be bolder
Than I when behind her I 'm hid from her view,
And I will, I will whisper it, over her shoulder,
While out for an hour—in a double canoe!

"Thkn I stumbled into another ditch in the intense darkness, but
with a ringing cheer the Royal East Shropshire bounded onwards,
carrying me well in the midst of them. A 15-centimetre Krupp
went off in my face, carrying away my false collar. I replied by a
wild cheer, ana, mounting the Colonel's horse when he wasn't look-
ing, rode cautiously on, dodging the Bedouins, while dozens of shells
exploded under my boots. I assure you I had to retire more than
once, as the position was a trifle dangerous. I have all along cor-
dially approved all Sir G-abwet's plans, and I need not say that
nothing has been done without consulting some one whom, perhaps,
it would not become me to mention. The original plan of the
campaign, as altered and amended on inspection, has been closely
adhered to; and I have nothing but praise for the admirable manner
in whioh it was carried out, down to the very slightest details."
"Yes, my dear Laviwia," said Mrs. Ramshotham, rather annoyed
with her Niece, "I do know perfectly well what a soldier's 'have-a-
snaok' is. It is so-called because he carries his lunch in it. No,
my dear, I am not so ignorant as you may think."

A LITTLE HOLIDAY.
Still at Cattle—Early—Speech preparing—Trying moments—The

Olieanffai Cattle.—Next morning. Servant, having orders to wake
us all early, does so. Happy Thought. "If I'm waking, call me
early,"—bat not unless. Think he has called me too early. Reminded
of the Sluggard, "You have woke me too soon, I most slumber
again." Why should the Sluggard have been held up to
reprobation for this? If his charge against the person who roused
him, as he alleges, at an untimely hour was true, why blame the
Sluggard? Dr. Watts wrote the poem, I believe, and credits him-
self with the personality of the person who woke the Sluggard, and
who deserved to be rebuked for his officiousness and uncalled-for
interference.
""Kb the Voice of the Sluggard,
I hear him complain."
The "I" is clearly the Poet: the Poet was Dr. Watts, and of
what did the Sluggard complain f It can be thus periphrased.
The Sluggard (loq.) You (Dr. Watts) have woke me too soon,
confound you 1 Let me slumber again. Get out, or I '11 shy my
slippers at your head!"
And naturally exit Dr. Watts.
What is the time? Servant replies that "It is just on half-past-
seven : breakfast at eight, because of going to the Eisteddfod." 'Oh,
; just on half -past-seven, eh t Not quite half -past-seven t" /'No, not
quite." Ah 1 And then arrange with myself that, when it is exactly
half-past seven—exactly, mind, not a second or a fraction of a second
more or less—I will get up. I will be punctual to the moment. I make
this oontraot silently with myself, while the man pulls up the blinds,
arranges my clothes, and bath, and boots. I am very particular
about everything being arranged ready-to-hand, as it would be
dearly a waste of time to get up, and then have to wait lor any-
thing. "Have you got everything ready P" I ask, with a sort of
vague hope that he will answer, "Everything, Sir-exoept thei boota
-or exoept the hot water "-and so give me a respite. But this is
not his reply: it 1b simply, "Yes, Sir; everything quite ready for

having been wrong, and to wonder where on earth I put my watch
last night, and what I should do if I were to get out and find I
had half a minute to spare when I might have remained in bed, the
servant stops at the open door, so as to let me hear the cluck in the
passage striking, and says, "It's the half-hour striking, now, Sir,"
to which I politely reply from the bed-clothes, "Thank you!"
and wish he had kept his entirely gratuitous information to himself,
as now I am bound by my contract with myself between myself,
that is, and my Better Self; my real Better Half, in fact—[Note.—
Subject for Psychological Essay.—The Better Half .... also,
Serious and Moral Song, on the model of " The Better Land "—" I
hear thee speak of the Better Half"']—to get up at once. Inferior
Half says. "Break your contract." Superior Half says, "Keep
it like half a man of honour. Remember I—breakfast at eight;'
and suddenly with a power of will which is only exceeded by my still
stronger power of "wont," I am on the floor. I stop to make a few
notes. Dr. Watts. Sluggard .... and so forth; and then I begin
to face the world, which I cannot do as atTpresent attired.
How am I this morning P Odd, everything has a muffled sound
on one side of my head. The precise feeling is that of a bather with
water in one ear, which won't come out. I jump and shake my head
violently on one side. No result; L'vc caught cold. It was dancing,
and then coming out hot into the moonbeams. The only person who
ever went safely out into the moonbeams was the Vampire in some
play I saw years ago, in which, whenever the Vampire was killed,
as he was regularly at the end of every Act,—and I think there were
six of them,—he invariably asked a friend to take him out into the
moonbeams, and on the friend foolishly complying with the request,
the Vampire, becoming suddenly all alive again, and far more
vigorous than he hod ever been before, turned most ungratefully on
his benefactor, and either ate him or threw him over a precipice, to
prevent his making any unpleasant revelations. Happy Thought.
Never trust a Vampire."
The result of my going out into the moonbeams, and riot being a
Vampire, is that on one side of my head I am, this morning, as deaf
as a post. [Note,—New simile wanted here; for my Similia Similibus
Book. "P," Post; see under " D," deaf as a old simile; what's
the new one ?....] Can't stop now to think .... gong just
sounded. I could hear that: but only with my right ear. If this con-
tinues all day, "What goes in at one ear, can't "get out at the
other," and 1 shall have a terrible headache. Most unfortunate when I
wanted to listen to all the fine old Welsh National Airs played on the
national instrument.
Breakfast has not commenced, as, from my window, I see my host
pacing the terrace with a doff. He frequently stops, and appears to
be addressing somebody, invisible to me, in the moat. Occasionally
he seems to be speaking energetically to the dog, who thereupon
wriggles his body about, waggleB his head obsequiously, and shakes
his tail. Then Wtnevan paoes again—then he stops and pats the
dog's head—then he leans on the parapet, and evidently addresses
somebody either out in the park, a long way off, or down in the moat.
Where I am I can't hear a word, but I am sure he is speaking,
though, from here, I oan't see his lips move. [Happy Thought. I
know what he is doing. He is rehearsing his speech which he has
to make from the Eisteddfod platform, to an imaginary audience in
the moat, with the dog as a sort of prompter. Yes; I pity him:
that speeoh will spoil all his pleasure till he has got rid of it. The
"speechless" terror of a man suddenly called upon a Fimproviste to
return thanks for something, or somebody, utterly uninteresting, is
nothing to the slow mental and physical torture consequent on being
informed that that day three weeks you will have to make a speech,
and then gradually working up the materials, which you either
change every day, substituting or rearranging, until there is a sort
of kaleidoscope of paragraphs, with the exordium continually shift-
ing into the place of the peroration, and the peroration perpetually
changing places with the exordium. Finally, on the morning of the
very day itself, you hit upon a brand new and original idea for the
speech, whioh throws the previous notions into the shade, and starts
something quite fresh; and then, at the last moment, you determine
to leave it ail to chance, and ultimately astonish yourself, and others,
by a few commonplaces whioh have been said by everybody a hun-
dred times before, and by condensing the deep meditations of several
weeks into a disjointed speech of about a minute and a half, which
seems an hour to you, and three to your audience. After the event
has passed and gone, the speech spoken never to be recalled, then
follow the after-thoughts and the silent regrets as to the good
things you might have said—if you 'd only thought of 'em at the
moment. How you would have made 'em laugh, had you said so-
and-so like this;—how they would have applauded this brilliant
simile, and what cheers would have followed the apt quotation which
you make now before your dressing-table, the last thing at night.
What point! What humour! What a memory I What command
of language! if all the dinner party could only come now, sit in the
bedroom, and hear you speaking just as you are doing at this moment
before your own looking-glass which reflects your classic garment,
what a success you would be I]
Breakfast.—We drop in by ones, by twos and threes. Despite the
host's great politeness and hospitable thoughtfulness for every-
body's wants, down to a small lump of sugar or passing the salt, I
am sure the coming speech is going round and round in his brain like
the .whirligig at a fair. [Note this simile in Similia Similibus
Book.] I know that, though he is smiling at me and saying. "Yes;
I am afraid the weather is not so favourable as it might be, and so
forth, his other speaking self inside his head is addressing a crowd
from a platform and saying, "Friends! Welshmen I—[applause.)
—Countrymen! —[great applause.) —the Festival, which we are
assembled to celebrate, is dear to every Welsh heart—[enthusiastic
applause.)—and to none, be they where they may, is it dearer than
to the loyal hearts that beat in warm response to this national
summons in this our own sweet native portion of our beloved
Principality."

attending to Miss Mabel, asking her if she prefers muffins to toast,
he is really (inside his head) listening to the " loud and prolonged
cheers" which greet the opening of his address and give him time to
look about him and consider what he '11 say next. His heart is in
the Eisteddfod; his heart is not here, among the muffins and the tea
and coffee.
The hutler informs Wtnevan and any gentlemen who are accom-
panying him that the carriage will be here in less than a quarter of
an hour.
Johnnie Peosser enters with a sort of just-out-of-the-bath-and-
not-quite-sure-about-anything-yet sort of air, looking so peculiarly
fresh, neat, and clean that those who see him every day wonder how
it is that no matter at what hour he goes to bed, or when he rises,
he always looks more peculiarly fresh, neater, and cleaner on that
particular day than ever he did before. But if he goes on like this,
what will his freshness, neatness, and cleanliness be at the last f
"The other ' Johnnies,' " he says, inoluding all the bear-fighters
of the previous night under this plural appellation, "aren't down yet."
From him I learn that the Bard was a bit " chippy " this morning.
"The Gay Sportsman," continues Johnnie, alluding to Professor
Edwards by this title, as with his hands in his pockets, his eye
wanders, undecidedly, from eggs to ham, trom ham to fish, from fish
to kidneys, and thence to the cold pies and meats on the sideboard
—" the (Jay Sportsman was rather 'jumpy.' He had to go off about
seven in a dog-cart, with his musical instrument."
"The Minstrel Boy to the Eisteddfod's gone!" says Miss Mabel.
"Let him alone, and he '11 come home, and bring his harp behind
him," cuts in Johnnie, under the impression that he is completing
the quotation with wonderful correctness.
Mrs. Moffham, a very lively young lady, who has got a husband
somewhere in the house, but whom up to now nobody distinctly recol-
lects having seen, unless it was he, and not the Bard, who was left
asleep on the sofa last night, explains that " Mr. Edward Edwards
had to go in early, in order to open some musical department with a
lecture illustrated on the harp."
Johnnt is heard to mumble something about " The Early Bard
catches the"
"The cold, I should say," says Miss Mabel.
"The Champion will be awfully jumpy on the harp," observes
Johnnie, and adds, as he settles down steadily to hot tea, fish, and
eggs, "Never saw a minstrel less fit in my life."
\_Happy Thought.—Poeta nascitur non "fit." Work this out, and
put it down to the younger Sheridan. Also " Fit as Fiddle "—new
simile wanted for new Similia Similibu* Book. Mustn't forget
note-book to-day. Welsh similes.]
Freddie and Hughie arrive together, both fresh, and very sporting
in the way of stiff cut-throat collars, spotless light ties, tight-fitting
clothes, and shiny boots. Seeing them, Johnnie pauses, with a
fork in his hand, well on the defensive, as if fearful of a renewal
of bear-fighting hostilities; but they are too hungry to " go for him"
now, and the host appears at the door, ready for departure.
"Hallo!" cry " the Johnnies" all together, striking attitudes,
one at the sideboard and two at the table. "Ain't he 'got 'em
on!" This is in allusion to our host's appearing in full London
afternoon -walking-costume, hat included.
"Must do it 1" he explains, apologetically, "as I 've to take the
chair, and speak."
"Hooray 1" cry the Johnnies.
"I '11 be behind, and help you," says Hughie, brandishing a fork.
"I'll chuck a word in whenever you dry up," says Freddie.
"And I '11 be in front, and sing out 'Hear, hear 1' whenever
anything goes wrong," cries Johnnie, heartily.
Our host's face lengthens perceptibly. He has evidently not
anticipated these invaluable offers of assistance.
"If you oome," he says, addressing them seriously, and implying
a doubt as to whether they are really coming or not; "if you do
come," he says, "for goodness sake don't play the fool. You '11 get
me in a homd row if you do."
"All right, old Chappie, we won't," says Freddie, helping himself
to butter.
I fancy I detect an electric wink pass round, but this may be,
after all, only an optical illusion, as their noses are steadily down
towards their plates, and they are fully and seriously occupied at
all events just now.
"Where's ' J. B.'?" asks Wtnevan.
Nobody seems to know.
"Where's Moffham P"
"Who?" they all repeat, looking up, as if he had mentioned the
Emperor of China, or any other unlikely visitor.
"Moffham," repeats Wtnevan, in answer to a hopeless shake
of everyone's head, expressive of utter ignorance on the Bubjeot.
He explains further—'f Mrs. Moffham's husband."
"Don't know," answer the Johnnies. "Never seen him."
"Tou must have seen him," remonstrates Wtnevan.
"Don't think so," returns Freddie, "unless he was one of the
sofa-cushions Johnnie was chucking about last night."
"Well," says Wtnevan, consulting his watch, "perhaps you'd
better stay for ' J. B.' and Moffham, and we '11 go on."
"All right!" replies Johnnie. "Tell train to wait for us."
"Oh, you've plenty of time," says Wtnevan, with a meaning
glance at me, which I interpret correctly, as we walk into the hall.
Johnnie, from inside breakfast-room, sings out, "Don't let 'em
have the procession up the town without us."
"And the waving of swords," shouts Hughie.
"And the crowning the Bard," shrieks Freddie.
"All right!" responds my host; and, as we fix ourselves in the
dog-cart, he says, confidentially, to me, whom he can now trust on
the Eisteddfod subject, as he sees I am really deeply interested in
it, "They '11 miss the train—safe. I 'm rather glad of it, as, if they
played the fool, when the Mayor, and the M.P.'s, and Sir Wtnktn,
and all the county magnates are there, it would never do, would it?"
"Oh, certainly not, I admit, warmly scouting any such notion.
"And the people wouldn't like it. 'Pou my word, I think, if they
played the fool and chaffed the Eisteddfod people,, or made fun of
the Bard, I do believe the people would make it rather warm for
them; and I couldn't interfere, if they brought it on themselves.*
Again I admit his decision to be just and politic. Then, recalling
"the Johnnies' " last words, I ask,
"Is there a Procession P" '-'/*»■ ^
"Oh, yes," replies Wtnevan.
"Grand?" I ask. \
Wtnevan is uncertain on this point. He evidently doesn't wish
to lead me to expect too much. I feel surt it will be grand.
"In what vale," I ask. "is the Eisteddfod held?"
"Well—it's not out-of-doors—of course it ought to be," Wtnevan
says, apologetically; "but—as a matter of fact—it is in a covered
building—a portable sort of House—or Hall—Wood."
"Oh 1" I exclaim, all the romance of the idea being taken out of
the entire proceeding at one fell swoop—" oh—a wooden portable
house—but"—and lam silent, as I see he is still rehearsing his
speech to himself. But the idea of the national Eisteddfod in a
portable wooden house! 1 I note that my deafness is increasing.
Unfortunate. Large crowd at station. All make way respectfully
and silently for Wtnevan. Instinctively they feel he is The Man
with. The Speech, and the guard locks us into a first-class compart-
ment, where he will be undisturbed till we arrive at Llanbigh. We just
catch sight of the ladies of our party getting into another carriage.
A pleased smile passes over our host's countenance: "The
Johnnies" have missed the train! I, too, am not sorry. We are off 1

Llanbigh station. Great crowd. Lnmense cheering Justin front
of our door. Wtnevan delighted. I am prepared to shine with
reflected popularity. Door opened. Cheers louder. He is prepared
to bow and make a sort of royal descent, so am I.
"Wtnevan for ever!" shout voioes we at once recognise.
"They are here I " sighs Wtnevan helplessly, as he almost col-
lapses on the step.
™ Yes, we are all here!" they answer. It is "The Johnnies" in
full force, with little bits of red ribbon in their button-holes, bowing
and cheering, and in the highest possible spirits.

A COURT CIRCULAR NOVEL.
The Court Circular, watched closely day by day, is full of social, romantic,
and dramatic interest to all those.who have acquired the science of " Reading
between the Lines." Last Monday
week the following: exciting news
appeared:—
"Viscount Lyons dined with the Queen
and the Hoyal Family. The Earl of Ken-
marb had alao the honour of being invited."
Viscount Lyons dined with Her
Majesty and the Royal Family, who
of course were delighted with this
opportunity of feeding the Lyons. But
the Earl of Kenmare, though invited,
didn't dine. Why was this T Mystery.
Did he reply to his invitation? The
whole story is wrapped in impenetrable
mystery, and so we leave it, and proceed
with Lord Lyons. The Noble Lord was, of course, proud and delighted at
having Her Gracious Majesty and the Royal Family all to himself. But what
happens next day? The Court Circular, which never wastes words, continues
what we may call Chapter II.:—
"The Rev. Dr. Donald MacLeod, one of Her Majc*ty's Chaplains, arrived at the
Castle yetterday, and had the honour, as well as Lord Lyons, of dining with the Qcbbn
and the Hoyal Family."
_ Pride has a fall; for the Rev. Dr. Donald arrived at the Castle apparently
without invitation, merely en passant, and straightway he "as well as Lord
Lyons" (how satirical the C. C. can be !), "had the honour of dining with the
Queen and the Royal Family."
"His Excellency Viscount Lyons, G.C.B., has left the Castle."
He came in like a Lamb and went out like a Lyons.
The Court Circular is really more interesting than many a novel, to those
who know how to "read between the lines."

For peltries at a killing gallop.

So that it yet kindly beget

SIR DRUMMING WOLFF, M.P.
AN ULTRAMARINE EFFECT.
The_ Timet Correspondent at
Ismailia deserves credit for a piece
of word-painting remarkable for
a splendid stroke of colour:—
"There was no moon, and thus,
almost within cannon-shot, the two
armies were resting peacefully, the
one side dreaming probably little of
the terrible scene of the awakening,
when, their rest at length rudely dis-
turbed, they awoke to see swiftly
advancing upon them from every Bide
an endless line of dreaded red-coats,
broken by the even more fearful blue
of the Marines."
The bits of blue thus dashed in
amongst the red are as telling as
anything Rush in could possibly
praise; and they have the addi-
tional merit of suggestiveness.
Every reader must see that the
blue in bright contrast with the
red uniforms was also in brilliant
keeping with the blue funk into
which the sudden appearance of
Sir Gasket Wolselet's troops
threw Aram's followers.
Yes, Followers. That is the
word. Ababi, as soon as he saw
how matters were going, ran
away, and his forces ran after
him, quite discoloured all over, if
not" distilled almost to jelly with
the effect of fear" [Shakspeare).
Generalissimo Punch's Happy
(Thought) Despatch to his
brave Soldiers in the East.—
Mr. Punch is delighted at being
able to announce that, last
Saturday, Eighty-two Half-yearly
volumes, being an entire collec-
tion of His Periodical, from July,
1841, to June, 1882, were for-
warded from His Fleet Street
Residence, for the use of our sick
and wounded in the Military
Hospital at Cyprus.
JUSTICE TO PUNCH AND IRELAND!
[Before the L. J. Public Opinion.)
At the opening of the Court, Mr. Punch rose and said that
he wished to make a personal explanation.
The Lord Justice said that he thought such a course hardly neces-
sary. _ For more than forty years, Mr. Punch had been the pioneer
of civilisation, and the champion of Right and Truth. [Cheers.)
Mr. Punch thanked his Lordship. Unhappily, however, there
were those who had misrepresented him—he could not say misun-
derstood him, for all he wrote and drew was as clear as crystal to
the unperverted intelligence—and he appeared that day to set those
misrepresented right, once and for all.
The Lord Justice. But is it worth the trouble?
Mr. Punch replied that, for the sake of the veracious historian of
the future, and not simply for his own sake in the present, it was
incumbent upon him to refute the statements to which he had alluded.
The misrepresentation of which he justly and seriously complained
had been disseminated by such respectable organs of thought as
the Spectator and the Nineteenth Century. In the latter a para-
graph appeared a short time since to the following effect:—"No
Savages have ever been so mercilessly held up to loathing mockery
as the Irish Peasants by the one comic paper in Europe which has
been most honourably distinguished for its restraint, and decorum,
and good-nature." The Spectator, too, had a paragraph to much
the same purpose.
The Lord Justice. But surely, Mr. Punch, there must he some
mistake. The typical figures of Irish Peasants that have appeared
in your cartoons from time to time have always struck me as
peculiarly pleasing personages—either hard-working fellows strug-
gling manfully with poverty.and adversity, or (in your smaller outs)
as the sort of "boys" with whom readers of Lever and Lover and
admirers of Boucicault are familiar.
Mr. Punch said that His Lordship was quite accurate in his
description, and nothing could be more absurd than the paragraph
he had quoted. He might add that, whenever Hibernia appeared,
it was always in the character of a beautiful and lovable girl, some-
times smiling, but more often thoughtful, anxious, and sad. [At
this point the Lady herself rose in Court, and created a profound
sensation by requesting to be allowed to give her evidence on behalf
of her old and true friend, Mr. Punch.']
Hibernia said that she first made her appearance in Mr. Punch s
pages on the 25th of April, 1846, or more than six-and-thirty years
ago. ,
The Lord Justice [gallantly). Impossible 1 Why, you can scarcely
be one-and-twenty at the present time!
Hibernia blushingly thanked his Lordship, hut added with a sigh
that it was a wonder to herself and her friends that her eyes were
not dimmed with tears and her face worn with care. She attri-
buted her present youthful appearance to the fire of hope which had
never been quenched in her heart, and it was this light in her eye
that Mr. Leech, and Mr. Doyle, in the past, had so lovingly caught,
and which Mr. John Tknniel, who always made her look her very
best, had perpetuated, she had almost said stereotyped, in the present.
She took this opportunity of thanking him, for his truthful pencil had
seldom flattered but always encouraged her. It was, however, in
1846 that she first appeared in Mr. Punch's pages, in the Cartoon
of "The Irish Cinderella and her haughty sisters, Britannia and
Caledonia." This was drawn by Mr. John Leech, who, Hibernia
explained, had his own types of good and bad among her sons. In
this she herself was depicted as a sad, gentle girl, seated before an
empty grate, while her two ugly sisters—as old as they were con-
temptuous—naughtily turned their backs upon her. In the previous
number, Irish peasants, represented by pretty little girls and funny

Professional Player. "A 'Yorker,' Sir I Oa, when the Ball's pitched right up to the Block"

little boys _(" broths of bhoys"). were depicted as going into a
ruined cabin, driven by Peel (as an old woman) with a biroh
labelled "Coercion Bill." This picture was called "Justice to
Ireland," and had for a sub-title,—
"She gave them some broth without any bread,
Then whipped them all round, and Bent them to bed."
In both Cartoons sympathy was enlisted for the Irish nation, and
for the Irish nation only. In the October of the same year, John
Bull was shown giving a starving Irish family—consisting of a poor
broken-down man, with a careworn wife (whose eyes and hands
were raised to Heaven), and two fainting children—a basket of
bread and a spade. John Bull was saying, " Here are a few things
to go on with, Brother, and I '11 soon put you in a way to earn your
own living." This was called " Union is strength." It was drawn
by Mr. Richard Dotle. And from that time to this, she (Hibernia)
and the deserving Irish peasant had found a firm supporter in
Mr. Punch. She challenged his detractors, whether Irish-American
or English, to produce one Cartoon capable of being fairly construed
as ungenerous, vindictive, or in any way hostile to herself and her
honest loyal people. (Great applause.)
The Lord Justice [after silence had been with difficulty restored).
If. my dear Madam, on your friend Mr. Punch's behalf you wish to
adduce any further evidence
H'bernia. I do, my Lord, for when I come into Court for a friend I
like to say out all I have to say, and do what I have to do thoroughly.
(Here several volumes of Mr. Punch's works were handed to her.)
See here, my Lord [opening one), this Cartoon in 1844, where Her
Gracious Majesty is drawing the Emfbbor of Russia's attention to
the maps of Poland and Ireland, and saying "Brother, Brother,
we're both in the wrong." [Applause.) I will now draw your
Lordship's attention to this. [Exhibits another Cartoon.) One of
my boys has a blunderbuss, and Punch is saying to him, "Put
away that nasty thing, and let's have a merry Christmas dinner."
There is no ill-feeling in that; very much the contrary. Again,
to come to a recent date, she would produce Mr. Tennlei's Cartoon
of " Friend or Foe?" Sept. 4,1880? where the Irish peasant, a decent
man as you 'd wish to see, was hesitating between the seditious gun
and the honest, lawful reaping-hook. Here was the Irish peasant
fairly represented. And now, said Hibernia, opening another
Volume, look at this for Oot. 29, 1881—" Two Forces!" where the
strong arm of the Law is shown protecting me from the violence of
a brute bearing on the ribbon of his hat the word " Anarchy." This
last figure, more or less intensified, has invariably done duty for the
spirit of lawlessness, Fenianism, and agrarian outrage by which a
few of my children have brought disgrace and misery upon us all.
In " The Irish Frankenstein," May 20, 1882, was shown the monster
the Land-Leaguists had called into being, which threatened even its
own maker. This hideous type did not represent the honest, loyal.
Buffering peasant, but the figure in Mr. Tennlel's "Arrears"
Cartoon did so, and here English sympathy was enlisted for the
evicted peasant.
The Lord Justice rose and said that surely Mr. Punch required no
completer refutation to the libel. Mr. Punch bowed, and the Lord
Justice continued, emphatically, "You have been the object of a
calumnious attack, which, not for your own sake, but in the interests
of true history, yon have taken the best means in your power of
satisfactorily answering and completely refuting. May your real
friendship with Hibernia be life-long! Ladies stnd Gentlemen, the
Court is dissolved; and being dissolved, I can lay aside my judicial
decorum together with my official robes, and—[here the Usher handed
glasses round)—here is health, happiness, and prosperity"
Mr. Punch [raising his glass). To Hibernia 1 Hibernia for
ever! (Cheers)
Hibernia. And—permit me—[taking Mr. Punch's hand)—to
wish the same, and very many of 'em, to the Sage of Fleet Street
and the true Friend of Ireland I

Miss Davenport is too Davenportly for the little Theatre in
King's Street, which, if it were devoted to light musical entertain-
ments, might have been fitly named the Bandbox Theatre. There
was a report that this lady had taken the Theatre from its present
comic proprietor (whose name we forbear to mention, as ne has
always shown hinm«lf go averse to anything like unnecessary
publicity) and, in consequence, had chosen to open with a Drama,
appropriately termed, Diane de Lease. Of course, this is a mistake,
as much as is the denoument of Mr. Mobtimer's adaptation of
Dumas' Diane de Lys, whom he might have called Diane de Loose.

Mr. Vezin makes a hit by missing a Man and shooting a Miss.

THE LATEST THING IN ADVERTISING.

A Positive Head for a
Comparative Header.
MRS. R. ON BOULOGNE-SUR-MER.
Mrs. Ramsbotham, who has been staying at Boulogne for a short
time, writes as follows:—
"Bullown-some-Air is, I am informed, not what it used to be,
though the smells must be pretty much as always, which is not the
—-— - scent of rheumatic spioes. It's called
BuUown-some-Air because if the sea-breeze
wasn't too powerful for the smells, living
would be impossible. Many of the visitors
to the hotels on the Key told me the bed-
rooms were full of musketeers, who oame in
when the candle went out, and bit them all
over. Such a Bight as one poor gentleman
was! He reminded me of the Spotted
Nobleman at the Agrarian in "Westminster.
Then, on the Sunday I was there, a day as
I had always been given to understand the
French were 'tray gay,' there was actually
no music, no band, no concert, and in fact
no amusement whatever at the Establish-
mong day Bangs (so called because there's a
shooting-gallery next it, where they bang
away all day at so much a head), which might as well have been
closed, as there was no race-game (of which 1 had heard so much),
no Tom Bowling * (they wouldn't get up a Tom Bowling unless there
were nine persons present, which Mr. Hackson says is much the
same as when magistrates meet and there isn't a sufficient number to
make a jorum), and only one gentleman trying to produce another to
play billiards with him.
"There was a Theatre open. Not being a Samaritan myself,
though as strict as anyone as to my own regular religious diversions at
church, I let Mr. Hackson take myself and Lavdiia to see The Clogs
of Cornwall, whioh, I think, was the name of the Opera, though, as I
hadn't a bill, and didn't understand one quarter of what they were
saying—not but what I was annoyed by Law? and Mr. Hackson
always turning round to explain the jokes to me—I confess I did not
see what either Cornwall or Clogs had to do with the story. The
singing and the acting was worse than anything I 'd ever met with at
an English seaside Theatre, because a place like Bullown ought to
have a Theatre as good as the one at Brighton. The customs worn
by the Actors were ugly, and when the Lover, who was intended for
a sailor—though his dress wasn't at all de rigger— said, confiden-
tially, to the audience, alluding to an unfortunately plain young
person who played the part of the Herring, "She is lovely I " there
was a loud laugh, or, as Mr. Hackson, who speaks French perfectly,
called it, a levy de reedo, all over the house, and this emulating from
people who, I always thought, were remarkable for their politeness,
was about the rudest thing I ever heard done to a public character in
a Plavhouse.
"The place was hot, and the seats uncomfortable; so that after
two Acts, which was more like being in a penitentiary than a
* We fancy Mrs. E. means " Tombola."
place of recrimination, we left, and went to our hotel, where, there
being nothing more to do than there was anywhere else, Lavinia and
myself retired to rest—that is, such rest as the musketeers would
allow us. She slept in a baok cupboard, called a cabinet de Twilight,
because it was so dark and scarcely any veneration, there being no
fireplace, and only such a window, as it was healthier to keep shut than
open: but she had the advantage over me in not being troubled by
any musketeers. There was only one of them in my room, and when
I heard him singing away like a couple of gnats, I hid under the bed-
clothes, and he couldn't find me till I came up again for air, like a
fish, and then he bit me on the forehead.
"Next morning we went to breakfast' a la four sheets' they call
it, on account of the size of the table-napkins, at the Rest-wrongs
on the pier. The time they kept us! as there was only one gossoon
to about twenty persons. The best thing we had there was our own
appetite, which we brought with us.
After this there was nothing doing in the place till dinner-time
(called table doat because they 're so fond of it), and after that there
was a dull concert at the Esiablishmong, and as Mr. Hackson told
us, who went there, a dull dance and poor fireworks at the Artillery
Gardens in the Oat Veal. The ' Oat Veal' is French for the high
part of the town, but, judging from the smells on and about the
Key, I should say that our hotel was situated in quite the highest
part of the town.
"Less than a week at Bullown was quite enough and too much for
us. If Sunday here were only lively, it would be a nice change
from London, or Dover, or Folkestone, or ltamsgate, as I do not
know a pleasanter and easier way to go than starting by the London,
Chatting and Dover train at 10 a.m. from Victoria or Holborn Via-
duct, arriving at Dover at twelve. Then by one of the comfortablest
boats I was ever in, called the Inflicter or Invigorator, I couldn't
catch which, but Mr. Hackson told me it was Latin for ' Uncon-
quered,' which takes you, if it's a fine day and wind and tide
favourable, in an hour and a quarter to Callous (or Kally in French),
and if you are only going on to Bullown, you have your luggage
examined (as if you were a smuggling Brigadier!), and you nave
more than an hour for lunch before you start again. The luncheon
at the Kallyous Buffy is excellent, and the buffers, who speak English
with hardly any accident, are most attentive. Then, when you 've
finished, you start for Bullown by the 2 45 train, and are at your
hotel by 3 '30 or thereabouts, which is what I call doing it uxuriously.
"But Bullown, as Mr. Hackson said to me, requires some ongter-
prenner, which means ' an Undertaker,' to look after it, as it has
become so deadly-lively. I think this must be ajoke of Mr. Hack-
son's, one of his caramboles, as they call them in French, as what
Bullown wants is waking up. As it is now, BuUown is a second-class
place, and will soon be a third-class one, which, as Mr. Hackson
says,'Abbt and an inferior dummy-mong will have all to themselves.

That people must get home.
But City men, in Castelnau,

They 'd better pull it down;
By Chiswick's gods we ask how we
Shall ever get to town?"

Yet how can he come quicker
Who round by Fulham plods,
Beoause, against his crossing here,
Sir James will give him odds f
If from some ' small and early'

He homeward turns his weary step:—
The Thames still flows between:
And though they start a ferry
Of tonnage far too slight,
He can't expect the ferryman
To sit up half the night.

Beyond proud Notting's ridge,
A halfpenny would bring him
Across the classic bridge:
For Hammersmith and Mortlake,
Ere both of them were sold,

Is distant as a foe,
And whether tide be running high,
Or whether it be low;
The man, who on the water's edge
Stands shivering and cold,
Must use strong: language seldom

In the brave days of old."
But meanwhile axeand lever
Have ruthlessly been plied.
And soon the ancient structure
Will have a new inside.
But louder grows the thunder
About the route to town,—
And p'raps they '11 get a wooden briJge
A little lower down.
So in some night next Winter,
When the cold Easters blow,
And the omnibus comes slipping
Amid the frozen snow;
When round the lonely villa
The fog wets to the skin.
And the cheap coal of Wallsend
Chokes everyone within;
When the latest bill is opened,
And the dimmest gas is lit.
And the curtains are drawn closer,
O'er the windows that won't fit;
When the leaden pipe is bursting
With the water it provides;
When the girls are reading novels,
And the boys are making slides;
When the goodman scans his cheque book,
With a fitting Christmas gloom;
And the goodwife's chatter sharply
Goes snapping round the room;
With threats and imprecations,
The tale may still be told
How great Sir James blocked up the
bridge
That Berved quite well of old.

Llanbigh.—Eisteddfod Day, or rather one of the Eisteddfod days,
as the ceremony continues during the greater part of the week.
Great crowd at Station. Trains from various parts. Carriages,
carts, traps of all sorts bringing in people for the Eisteddfod. Great
variety of colour in coats and ties and hats among the men; the
women being chiefly remarkable for their black eyeB—given them by
Nature, not by their husbands—and their wonderful umbrellas.
Not a sign of a National costume anywhere: not a woman with a
hat over a cap a la Jenny Jones; no lass coming in riding pillion:
but all trudging up-hill in a sturdy kind of way, with the determined
air of people who were not to be daunted by anything in the shape
of mud below or rain above.
Llanbigh is a town which has grown gradually up on a hill with a
Castle on the top. How it came to be built so, is evident. Castle
began it, or rather. Baron began it. First came the Baron, who
built the Castle. \_Happy Thought.—Arrange it like the House
that Jack built. (See my future History of Llanbigh, with Illustra-
tions . . . perhaps'.it might come into my Similia Simihbut Book.)
. . . This is the Castle that Jack built. No; Jack is not a good
Welsh name for a Baron . . . and it must be in one syllable. . . .
Happy Thought [for a Welsh name) —Jones. The Baron Jomw.
Good f "This is the Castle that Jones built" (a.d. 1100). "This
is the Baron who lived in the Castle that Jones built"—keep
Jones as the Architect—say Inioo Jones: the Baron being quite a
different person. "This is the Butcher who built a shop, and came
to stop, and make a fortune out of the Baron who lived in the Castle
that Jones built." Then—" This is the Grocer very green who sold
the cabbage and young French bean to be served with the meat, se
nice to eat, that was sold by the Butcher who built a shop and came
to stop, and make a fortune out of the Baron," &c, &o. Then gra-
dually came all the tradesmen to supply the wants of the Castle;

FLOWERS OF MODERN SPEECH AND SENTIMENT.
Our Gallant Colonel. "And where and how have rou spent
the Summer, Miss Goliqhtly?"
3/isj Golightly. "Oh, I sat in a Pont with my favourite
MAN—A QUITE TOO DELICIOUS MAN I"
and so the town was built downwards from the summit to its
base; by which time the Baron had probably hung all the trades-
men, seized their shops, and taxed them heavily, until another Baron
(without a Castle—a wandering Baron) came with a superior force,
and, with the assistance of the tradesmen, besieged Baron Number
One, starved the garrison, who, when they became desperately
famished, insisted on surrendering, gave up their feudal lord, and
strung him up under his own portcullis.
Wynevan, to whom a number of well-to-do people in the crowd
are most respectful, tries to ignore the presence of The Johnnies,
who, each of them being decorated with a bit of absurd red ribbon
in his button-hole, and wearing white kid gloves, follow him gravely
wherever he goes. Once Wynevan turns to remonstrate with
Hughib Grtllston and Johnnie Pbosseb, who happen to be close
at his heels.
"I say, look here, you fellows," says Wynevan, in an undertone,
and trying to smile it off as good-naturedly as possible, " I say,
don't play the fool, there's good chaps." Whereupon, by way of
exhibiting their thorough acquiescence in the reasonableness of his
request, they bow gravely, and turn to Freddie Mickham and
"J. B.," as though to communicate some instructions they have just
received from their superior.
Wynevan, taking advantage of this, hurries on towards an open
carriage, in which are seated Mrs. Wynevan, Mrs. Moffham, and
Miss Mabel, and in which there is still room for Wynevan and
for Moffham, who, however, is told by his wife that he had much
better walk, which he consequently does. So do I.
"Where s the procession with the bards and banners and
swords?" I ask Wynevan, as he enters the open carriage.
"Well," he says, pausing on the step, and looking about over the
heads of the crowd of pedestrians, "1 really don't see any. I fancy
we must be late, and the Mayor and the others have gone on. I
say," he urges me. stooping down, "do stop those fellows from
playing the fool. Upon my word, it '11 do me a serious injury."
_ Get in, Mr. Wynevan, do I" cries Miss Mabel, and, as he takes
his place in the carriage, The Johnnies give a cheer, in which
Moffham, who as yet has shown himself of the "party of order,"
suddenly joins. Encouraged by this unexpected adhesion, Hughle
and Johnnie take him between them, while, in attempting to sneak
off behind, I find myself placed like the centre pip in the five of
diamonds, and compelled to take part in the demonstration made by
"The Johnnies." Occasionally Freddie produces a small hunting-
horn, which he blows. Huohif. ties a red pockethandkerchief on
to a stick, and gives it to Moffham to carry. When Freddie is
quite tired of the horn, the four pretend to be a brass band, and
play imaginary instruments. To humour them, when Wynevan is
not looking, I join them, choosing any instrument which may be
unrepresented at the moment by the others. Huqhie Grillston,
with his cheeks puffed out, his left fist up to his mouth, and his
right arm working backwards and forwards like the piston of an
engine, is giving a pretty correct imitation of trombone-playing.
"J. B.," with a foolish expression of countenance, is amusing the
crowd with an imaginary performance on the fife, Johnnie is doing
the oymhals, and Freddie is pretending to mark the time with
powerful whacks on an invisible big-drum. I choose the bassoon.
The crowd begin to take to the performance: at first the boys
laugh timidly, whereat "J. B." frowns severely, which amuses
them immensely. Then their elders begin to see the fun of it, and,
there being a considerable amount of latent humour in a crowd, they
gradually enter into the spirit of the thing, and commence imitating
the performance, so that by the time we are half-way up the hill,
Wynevan's oarriage is accompanied by a crowd, composed of men,
women, and children—but chiefly boys—of various ages, all pre-
tending to play musical instruments, and to foUow the beat of
"J. B." 's stick, occasionally breaking off to cheer, when Moffham,
who up to now has been the gravest, quietest person possible, gives a
preposterous whoop, and waves his handkerchief violently.
It being impossible to utterly ignore such a demonstration, Wyn-
evan is compelled to recognise our services, which he does, with a
sort of more-in-aorrow-than-in-anger air, saying to the Ladies,
"Aren't they ridiculous P" I am sure he is wishing that he had never
asked any one of us to the Eisteddfod, and taking an oath to himself
never to do so again—if he knows it.
The instrumental imitation having been played out, there is a
pause in the amusements, and the up-hill work rather tells on most
of us. The most indefatigable practical joker must be pumped out,
if he tries to keep the game alive for one mile and a quarter's steady,
straight, severe, up-hill walking, following a carriage and pair.
Huqhie wants to know if we don't stop anywhere for refreshment.
Wynevan, overhearing this, says that they—" The Johnnies "—can
stop if they like (and he sincerely hopes they will like), but that he
and his party in the carriage must push on, as they are late
already.
This is treated as an address by Johnnie, who urges everybody to
cheer. There is only a faint response to his appeal, and it is evident
to everyone that the walking has exhausted the joking-power of The
Johnnies, and the appreciation of the crowd. At this moment, just
when I really am glad for Wynevan's sake that the nonsense is
finishing, Professor Edward Edwards suddenly comes out of a
house in his very best London walking-clothes.
This gives The Johnnies a fresh inspiration. Johnnie and Huohie
take him between them, call for three cheers, which the crowd of
Welsh people with whom the Bard is popular as "The Soaring
Lion," are only too delighted to give, and then, as he comes up
behind the carriage to speak to the Ladies and Wynevan, a fresh
order is suddenly and secretly issued by Johnnie Prosser, and they
allow the Bard to walk in the space between them and the carriage,
so that he shall form an important figure in the newly-arranged
procession. This he gravely does, much pleased by the deference
shown him, and in utter ignorance of what is taking place behind
his back, to which Wynevan does not dare to draw his attention,
lest the Bard should think that he was a party to this undignified
behaviour of his friends and guests. And what is taking plaoe is
this:—Huqhie, the three other Johnnies, and Moffham, who
begins to outdo them all, and myself (not liking to be out of it, lest
I should be immediately seleoted as the object of some new and
dangerous practical joke), have all turned up their coat-collars,
have crammed their pot-hats well back on their heads, and have
put their handkerchiefs up to their eyes, occasionally removing them
to look up, shake their heads dismally, and then hide their faces in
their handkerchiefs again.
At first the crowd are puzzled; but presently, they too, begin to
walk solemnly, and those who have pooket-handkerchiefs imitate
The Johnnies.
Wynevan can't stand it any longer.
"I say," he remonstrates from the carriage, "'pon my word, it's
too bad!'
But " The Johnnies" leading the crowd only pretend to be more
and more afflicted, the Ladies laugh, and the Bard makes a futile
effort to escape, but can't. Thinking better of it, he executes a very
clever strategic movement, by plaoing his arm in Johnnie Prosses's
in the friendliest manner possible, and engaging him in conversation.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"ALARUM. EXCURSIONS."
Scene—A Secluded Spot, by the Margin of a Lake. Enler a Cheap Trip, Tableau. Curtain I
[Happy Thought.—Take the opportunity of getting information
trom the Bard about the Eisteddfod.] I join him, hook his dis-
engaged arm, and am just congratulating myself (as I am sure
Wtnjkvan is)'on the cessation of tomfooleries, when a brass band
appears in front, which presents such an invincible attraction to
The Johnnies that they rush forward, and the next I see of them is
"J. B." leading the band, and throwing his umbrella in the air
after the manner of a tambour-major, while the others have encored
their own inimitable imitation of the Marching Musicians.
W ynevan stands up in the carriage.
"Good heavens 1" he exclaims. "I do wish some one would
stop that fellow Johnnie."
"What is he doing?" I ask.
"Doing!" exclaims Wtnevan, horrified. "He's tied a hand-
kerchief on his stick, and he's walking behind the Mayor—and—oh
—I say—it's too bad"
"What?" inquire the Bard, myself, and the Ladies, breathlessly.
"Confound it!—Hughie has stuck a long straw under Sir Wyn-
kyn's collar, and the others are walking bareheaded, and pretending
to cry. 1 swear the police will interfere directly."
The appearance of two carriages from round a corner, the narrow-
ness of the road, and the ascent becoming more and more difficult,
the walking worse and worse, and the commencement of a splutter
of rain, all these combined forces rout "The Johnnies," who for
awhile are lost in the crowd.
Nearly at the top of the hill, and at about the dirtiest, sloshiest
part of the walk, we suddenly come upon a large wooden building
with auctioneer-looking sort of placards stuok about it, as if there
were a sale going on inside. But for these trumpery-looking
"platers," the building itself might be a portable Theatre, or a
"nt up" for a Travelling Circus. This is the building in whioh
the Eisteddfod is held. As it is already beginning to rain heavily, it
is better to be under cover than among the hills and valleys where
I thought the Eisteddfod would have been. The building does not
look watertight, and subsequently, during the proceedings, the rain
penetrates, and a considerable number of the audience inside put up
their umbrellas.
"How it leaks!" says Mokfham.
\_Happy Thought.—Appropriate for National Eisteddfod in Wales
—s> building with leaks.]
"Leeks inteet! "_ Professor Edwards and many others are wear-
ing imitation leeks in their button-holes, made to resemble, as closely
as possible, lilies of the valley.
Wynevan and the Ladies disappear within the building, only
too delighted to disown "The Johnnies," who have become
entangled in the crowd. I follow Hughie Geiliston and "J. B."
The latter instinotively makea for what looks like a stage-door.
It is marked "Private Entrance." whereupon " J. B." at once says,
"This is the way—come along!" He raps the door with his stick,
imitating some one I don't exactly know who, but Hughie does,
and appreciates it, as he exclaims, "Open Thingummy!—no, I mean
Sesame!" and an old man appears, who refuses us admittance
until "J. B." boldly announces us as "Mr. Wtnevan's family,"
whereupon we are at once admitted, and ushered on to the platform.
Here there are a number of people standing about talking, a piano,
a harp, a huge chair, a table with a glass of water, and ten small chairs
all in a row. "Christy Minstrels," says Hughie; whereupon " J. B."
at once sits down, and pretends to perform on the banjo, and the other
imitates the action of Bones. Somebody from a corner is addressing
the audience in his own native tongue, of whioh we have already
heard a good deal on our way up. It sounds as if the speaker had
got something stuck in his throat, and was becoming more and more
irritable at not getting it out quick enough.
Wtnevan has contrived to make his speech before we arrived. It
must have been very short, with a view to getting it over before the
arrival of "The Johnnies" with their promised assistance. He
pretends not to see us as he seats himself in the big ohair, and turns
his back on the occupants of the platform. Hughie and "J. B." re-
cognise their boon companions among the audience, and commence
telegraphic operations. A programme is handed to me. We take
our seats. Behind us is a choir, which is going to compete with
another choir. We settle down into our places on the platform, and
try to look as imposing and as gracious as possible.

The saying that nine tailors make a man has had the light of
antiquarian research turned upon it, and is held to be a misreading
of "Nine tolers," or nine tolls of a churoh-bell for a masculine

the phrase is of German origin, standing thus—" Nine thalers make

THE LION'S JUST SHAEE.
{sEsop adapted.)
The Lion and several other beasts entered into what they pleased
to call a " Conoert," or_harmonious confraternity, and were to live
very sooiably together in the forest. One day, having made a sort
of excursion together by way of hunting, they sighted their quarry,
a creature of considerable prowess, and exceedingly awkward to
approach or to tackle. The concerted beasts were by this somewhat
disconcerted. The Foodie in particular, who had made great and
valiant show of special amity with the King of Beasts, abated asto-
nishingly his ardour, and was the first to seek safe, if inglorious,
isolation in the rear. The Fox, on the contrary, loudly insisted
upon his right to be well to the front, yet, by dint of squabbling for
priority of plaee, contrived solely to insure delay. As for the other
beasts, the Bear, though licking his paws longingly, made no
advanoe, the Greyhound confined himself to rather ineffective
snarling, and the Mule to somewhat aimless kicking, whilst the two
Eagles looked on watchfully, but without any attempt at .active
assistance.
The Lion, therefore, wearying of this situation of things, yet dis-
daining to relinquish the chase, shook off impatiently the hampering
paws of the Fox, and disregarding the equivocal attitudes of the
other beasts, made his spring—sharp, sudden, and unerring—alone,
and very soon had the quarry safe and silent beneath his conquering
claws.
Thereupon the other_ beasts eagerly gathered around him to con-
gratulate him upon his prompt success, and to go shares in its
advantages. The Foodie, coming minoingly forward, nestled affec-
tionately up to the tawny hide of the conqueror, saying " My dear
old Ally, this is all extremely nice and satisfactory, we have done
well indeed, you and I, and I really think we fairly deserve the
biggest share of the spoil— between us.'" The Fox looked somewhat
less amiable perhaps, but equally expectant. The Bear, his mouth
watering more than ever,* licked his paws with yet greater gusto.
The other beasts were, some silently watchful, others forward with
self-interested suggestions, others again not backward with warnings
against eager appetite, and recommendations of magnanimous
abstinence—on the part of the Lion.
But the Lion, standing calmly and somewhat disdainfully with his
foot upon the prostrate quarry, was pleased to declare hinmli after
the following manner:—
"Considering that the engagement with this enemy has turned
entirely upon my courage and conduct, I claim, I think not un-
reasonably, the right to determine the disposition of the fruits of
victory, guided rather by my own sense of the just and needful, than
by the magnanimous urgings of self-seekers, or the boldly offered
cautions of cravens."
Oh for Oysters!
In the Times the other day appeared the following piece of
particularly bad news :—
"' Native' oysters are much dearer this year than they have ever been
before, and the prospects are that they will continue to advance in price."
That is because they are continually growing scarcer and scarcer.
What is the Aborigines' Protection, Society about that it makes no
effort to arrest this increasing extermination of the Natives't

A GOOD-BYE TO JOLLY WHITBY.

And for the last time. Brown Senior attempts a feeble Fkekch Joke, beginning "Esker la Dam "and, as usual, falls

THE SPENDTHRIFTS GUIDE.—No. VII.
If the Spendthrift wishes to hand his name still further down to
posterity as a public benefactor, he can do it by setting the Law in
motion, either offensively or defensively. The Law is one of those
mighty engines which never moves, either for good or evil, without
a plentiful supply of coals and grease. The Spendthrift is in the
happy position that he can command any quantity of these neces-
saries. Let us teach him how to use them.
We may take it for granted that every hour in the day, every day
in the year, and every year in the century, some grabber is busy in
and about the Commons skirting all our great Cities, seeing now
much land he can possibly steal from the public. We may also take
it for granted that many members of the public would oppose these
robbers, even to the extent of pulling down buildings and destroying
barriers, if they were free from fear, not of the Law, but of the far
more dreaded costs of Law. Here the Spendthrift, like a Queen's
Proctor, may beneficially intervene. "We may take it for granted
that hundreds of poor struggling people—the traders of the gutter,
toiling to gain an honest living, instead of becoming burglars or
pickpockets, are daily prosecuted under some old and infamous Act
of Parliament for Sunday trading, or are " moved on " by an official
demon raised by some Tradesman's Protection Society. Here the
Spendthrift may again intervene.
We may take it for granted that scarcely a day passes in those
districts of our great Cities, where the lower middle-class are
compelled to congregate, in which the petty tyranny of the twin
monopolies, Gaa and Water, is not exercised at the expense of the
comparatively helpless. False quantities, bad qualities, dishonest
machinery, unbounded capital, and equally unbounded insolence,
are on one side; on the other side is nothing but poverty and
ignorance, or timidity, the result of poverty. Between these two
extremes stands a Government scarecrow, called, probably, a Public
Analyst, or a Publio Prosecutor, who is about as useful to the poor
and humble as a Lord Chancellor or an Archbishop. Here the
Spendthrift may profitably intervene.
We may take it for granted that the landlord of these settlements
—the ostensible lord of a thousand semi-detached villas—would be a
little less exacting in the matter of rent, and a little more honest in
the matter of roofing and drain-pipes, if he had the wholesome fear
of Bullion before his eyes. Here the Spendthrift may usefully
intervene.
We may take it for 'granted that the wholesale adulterator—
whether he takes the form of the stage-rustic milkman or the greasy
and sanotimonious butter man, would be far more virtuous^ under a
fear of Bullion, than he is under a fear of any other punishment.
The Spendthrift has a mission. He has the opportunity of raising
filthy lucre from the stye in which it usually wallows, and making
it a power for good as great as Civilisation.
A Friendly Hint.
John Bull will never grudge his thanks
To his brave Army's loyal ranks.
But owns he feels adversion utter
To too close link 'twixt "rank" and " butter."
MOSE IN E01TTO.
The appointment, by the Chief Rabbi, of a Day of Thanksgiving
with a Special Service at all the Synagogues in the kingdom, "for
the signal success vouchsafed to our arms in Egypt," derives peculiar
significance from having been preceded by the Rothschilds' muni-
ficent donation to the British troops of twelve tons of tobacco and
five thousand pipes. It is perhaps not merely from any consideration
relative to historical Egyptian bondage that the Israelites take
such an obviously peculiar interest in Egyptian solvency.
In the Oxford Diocese there are some Anglican Clergymen calling
themselves "The Cowley Fathers." Imitation is the sinoerest flat-
tery, but " 'tisn't the Cowley that makes the Monk."

Mare, who they calls their Bergo Master, tho' I 'm sure I don't know
why. Sumbody told me, I suppose as a joke, that the Master of the
Horse is named Count Sutmmelpknnywick.
In the afternoon they all went in state to see the King and Queen
and give 'em the bewtiful gold box as we all so much nadmired at
Mr. Bbnsow's, the Copperashun Jeweler, on Ludgit Hill, and a
werry pretty Bite they made, and wasn't there jest crowds of peeple
to stare at 'em.
As ushal, the Gentlemen of the Lord Mare's household created the
gratest sensashun, and they suttonly did look splendid. What with
their tall graoeful Aggers, and their lofty demeaner, and their lovely
uniforms, and their portly carves, they was the hobserved of all
hobserwers.
It struck me as the Mace Bearer looked jest a little pail, whether
from over anxiety, or from a bad nite's rest, this morning, of course,
I can't say, but the City Field Marshall, who was as carm as if he
was in his own native Capital and understood Dutch, looked
bloomin.
Everybody says as they had a most grashus recepshun, so I should
think indeed, on such a errand and with such a present, and that the
Lord Mare made a speech such as only Lord Mares seems able to
make, and then handed His Majesty the butiful Gold Casket wioh
the King and the Queen both wery much admired. Then His
Majesty, not to be outdone in pliteness by the Lord Mare, acshally
promised to come over next yeer, and dine with the Copperashun, let
who might be Mare, and thank 'em personally for their butiful gift.
That's what I calls somethink like a King. I wunder what our
enwious ennemys will say to that?
Afterwards the Civick party, as sumbody called 'em, dined with
their Majestys, and muoh I should ha' liked to have had the distin-
gwished honor of waitin upon some of 'em, but, in course, it was
unpossibel. I hear, tho', from certain privet sorces, that it was
quite fust rate, and seemed quite satisfactory even to both the Lord
Make and his two Sherryiffs, which is about the highest praise aa
can be given to any dinner, royal or not royal.
I spent the nex day in seeing the little Capital, which strange to
say they has named the Ague," only they spells it with a H.
I 'm not quite so serprised at the Name as I ought to be, for sut-
tenly a much damper place I should think don't exist nowheres,
what with the Canals, and their sloppy habits of always being a
washing of their wide clean street*. I was a good deal surprized at
the hutter habsense of Oranges, as the Prince himself lives there,
but I spose it 'a the old story, the nearer the Prince the further from
the Oranges.
I had a peep into their sillybrated Pictur Gallery, but lor bless
us all, I was most artily glad as Mrs. Robert wasn't with me, for
sum of the picturs is that rude as I don't feel at all sure as they
didn't a most make me blush.
I spose these little matters, like most little matters, is nothink
when you 're used to 'em, for I seed several werry nice looking young
Ladies acshally copying some of the most owdacious of the whole
lot, and aperiently thinking nothink of it.
Somebody accounted for it by saying that of course the Flemings
was werry Flematic, but I 'm sure I don't know what he meant.
I was a good deal disappinted with the Dutchmen, I means as
regards their bild. Why they 've got some Deputys in the Coppera-
shun as 'ud give 'em a stun and still beat 'em into fits either for
weight or figger, of course I don't mean figger heads.
In the evening I again braved the dangers of the stormy sea,
which I didn't care muoh about, but also the other unmentionabel
matter, which I did, and so home to brekfast with what appytight I
may, which I need hardly say wasn't much. Robert

The Fans from each famous Collection
Are gathered before us to-day.
Arranged for a careful inspection,
Laid out in an elegant 'way.
They speak of past days and old glories
Of fashion, when woe to the man,
The hero of tea-table stories,
Once told with the flirt of a Fan.
Some Fans here are huge and extensive,
And others as small as yon please,
Borne cheap and some very expensive,
These English, and those Japanese.
The skill of the painter could cover
The silk with the triumphs of Art;
Fit gift from an ardent young lover.
To her who had captured his heart.
What tales of old times might be uttered
By Fans, could they speak at our call,
Of routs where they used to be fluttered,
Of modish assembly and hall.
Time was when a lady could capture
And drive to distraction a man.
Could keep him 'twixt raving and rapture,
And all by the twirl of a Fan.
What love has been whispered behind you,
What scandalous tales nave been told;
How handy young ladies would tind you
When lovers became over-bold.
Tou hid all the exquisite blushes
That came with ihe compliments paid;
You signalled a sweetheart 'mid crushes
That parted a man and a maid.
And now yon are brought from oak presses,
Once more to the light of the day;
The lavender laid with the dresses,
Perfumes you in old-fashioned way.
You bring back past years and atrange fancies,
Of antique enjoyment and glee;
While Beauty rewards you with glances,
At Brighton—our London-on-Sea.

Hindus House Academy,
Mt dear. Parfkts, Oct.. 5th, 1882.
You will be glad to hear that I arrived here yesterday
evening, quite safely, before seven, after which hour not even the
Chaplain, who generally comes with orders, is admitted under any
pretext whatever. There were several other new boys at the StatioD,
and we found a vampire trap, sent from the Establishment, waiting
for us. I could not help thinking we formed a motley company as
we drove along with our private boxes and hampers full of property
eatables piled upbthind the vehicle. Picture to jourself a Chairman
of a Gas Company, two broken-down half-pay Officers, several
youthful Dukes who had run away from home, a mad Doctor over
seventv, and a Pork Butcher who means to play Romeo in the
agricultural districts, and you can conceive what an eager and
striking little group we made as we were received by the kindly and
attentive Matron, who, with a gracious smile, instantly directed us
to our dormitory.
We found ourselves, I own, rather high up, having been entered
at first as "sky-borders;" but the room, which, to accustom us to the
possible contingencies of our future career, bad been lavishly but.
judiciously papered, was bright and cleanly; and after rehearsing a
eapital supper with papier milche viands ana some of the best wool-
headed porter 1 have ever met with in a property goblet, to slow
music and with lamps down, we retired to rest on our little trick
bedsteads.
Once or twice, my dear Parents, during the night as the Begins
Professor of East End Harlequinade looked in, in his diagonally
spangled and parti-coloured official robe, and striking the floor
smartly, first near this one of us, and then near that, changed our
modest canvas couches, much to our surprise, at. one moment into a
cumbersome and blazing kitchen-range, at another, into a coster-
monger's cart attached to a donkey with a moveable tail, I confess
that my thoughts wandered back to the grand old ivy-covered
ancestral home, and the succession to two baronetcies that, after
mature consideration at the ripe age of five-and-forty, I had relin-
quished that morning for the excitements of a more stirring artistio
career. But, by keeping my eyes fixed on the prompter, who has to
give us the signal for waking with a red flag, 1 managed to feign an
excellent sleep, and was soon up betimes eager to begin the work of
the day.
Chapel over—(a touching little service conducted by processional
Monks and Archbishops walking two-ami-two round a quadraniile
to a cathedral door, with the organ playing outside)—1 presented
myself to the Principal, who happened to be laid up from the clients
of a severe frost in which he had been caught the night belore, but
who verv kindly put me at my ease by addressing me at once as
"Dear Boy," and advising me, if 1 wished to get on. without delay
to start a stage-coach, i.e. private tutor. Meantime I have been to
my first lecture on dramatic trigonometry, and I can already, from
a given centre, fairly describe an empty Dress-Circle, and show how.
upon a couple of well-worded under-lines, a very pretty figure can
often be constructed by the Management.
But I must close this, as the " Bally " Professor has just arrived.
Do not forget to send me my Pantomime fork, knife, and spoon. I
enjoy our recreations immensely, and am quite a dab already at
making a butter-slide outside a frequented shop-door; and I hope
to show you some screaming fun at home in the holidays when all
the old tenants over eighty come down the Hall steps to give you
their usual Christmas greetinjg. Mr. Hamilton Ai'nf.'s annual prize
of a large pasteboard head with winking eye, given for the best bit
of "demon business " to appropriate music, has just been carried off
much to everybody's surprise, and to his own, by a retired Kural
Dean who came here, so he said, to learn elocution. However, as I
am going to be coached by a celebrated tragedian, 1 hope to run u m
close next Easter. Ever your dutiful and dramatic Son,

MANCHESTER-SUR-MER
SEA-DUCTIVE PROSPECT.
FIGARO IN BEBLIN.
We are indebted to our solemn and highly respectable contempo-
rary, the Tagblatt of Berlin, for a report of a meeting of the
Barbers of that dusty capital, at which the following resolutions
were adopted, after a lengthy and animated discussion.
The first shows that the spirit of innovation has penetrated even
into Prince Bismarck's own capital, for it was solemnly and unani-
mously determined that, from that day forth, the more or less pain-
ful operation of shaving should always be commenced with the left,
instead of the right oheek. The reasons for this somewhat startling
innovation are not reported, but they were evidently of a most con-
vincing oharacter. We shall be glad to hear that but few aocidents
have followed from the sudden adoption of this somewhat rash
resolve.
The long disputed point as to whether the brush or the hand
should be used in the important preliminary operation of lathering,
remains still a vexed question, and is left, as before, to the discre-
tion, or taste, or fancy of the individual Bhaver. _ ."^
But the next, and by far the most important resolution submitted
J to the Congress, was unanimously and enthusiastically adopted, not
only so, but it was also resolved that no one should be allowed to
! remain a Member of the Association who continued to resort to the
I degrading and offensive practice of holding a customer by the nose!
Such a practice may have been all very well in olden times, when the
dignity of Manhood was unheard of; but, in these days of Citizen-
ship and Equality, such an insulting procedure must be at once and
for ever abolished.
To the next and final resolution we regret we cannot rive the same
cordial approval as to the rest; but it was decided by a large
majority of the shavers present, that the conversation with the
viotims, during the process of the operation, should not be allowed to
wander into remarks as to the state of the weather or similar
exciting topics, but should be strictly confined to business, meaning,
of course, the customary recommendation of "our own hair-wash,"
or hair-restorer, or hair-dye, as the case may seem to require.
The grave and earnest and solemn character of our Teutonio
friends, has seldom been more forcibly, or more amusingly shown
than in the proceedings of the Barber's Congress at Berlin.

A LITTLE HOLIDAY.
The Eisteddfod—Bards—Enthusiasm—Chairman—Competition—
Eminent M. P.—Progress—Disappointments—Refreshment,
I notice several semi-clerical-looking'and decidedly aged persons
about on the platform, decorated with what appear to be a number of
■mall tin cheese-plates and variegated ribbons. At a distance I
imagine them to be distinguished Freemasons who have forgotten
their aprons, but on inquiry I find that these tin cheese-plates are
medals, and that these aged semi-clericals are the Bards who have
won prizes in many former Eisteddfods. If this information be correct,
it occurs to me that these inspired geniuses must be the sole living
representatives of all the Prize Bards for the last half-century at
least. The united ages of these poetic patriarchs—there are about
five of them—must be over four hundred years. The youngest and
most energetic Bard is an enthusiastic person, whose lineaments
suggest a curious mixture of Beethoven and Bkadlaugii. He
evinces a strong desire to shake hands with anybody, slap everybody
heartily on the back, and whisper jokes in Welsh, or it may be poetry,
—I rather think they 're jokes, because he laughs himself, and smacks
me on the back after one of these confidentially genial communications,
—to anyone to whom he can cling affectionately for a minute or so. I
have never set eyes on him before, and have not been introduced to
him now, but he seems to take a fancy to me, and wants to embrace
me publicly on the platform, while he murmurs, in an unknown
tongue, what I am sure is a genuine Welsh side-splitter in my ear.
Judging from a curious poetic perfume which hangs about these
Old Minstrel Boys, and which may be the somewhat stale though
still forcible remains of the day before yesterday's inspiration, I should
say that they had been taking their divine afflatus hot and strong
after some Bardic Banquet, whereat the national leek and the uncom-
promising onion had formed important items in the bill of fare.
The Beethoven-Bradlaugh Bard, who insists on rapturously throw-
ing his arm round my shoulders and hugging me,—in mistake I am
sure for somebody else, only I do wish the right person would come
and remove him,—must have taken the Chair at this symposium,
and obtained the lion's share of everything.
At the present moment he is all inspiration and perspiration, and
I take advantage of his accidentally treading on somebody's toe to
get away from nim, and to dodge him whenever I become aware of
his approach. Thank goodness he is a very busy man, and is soon
sufficiently occupied with his fellow Bards, who seem to depend upon
him, and are all huddled together like sheep in bad weather, and
have become somehow or other mixed up with other peoples' umbrellas
and waterproofs in a corner of the platform, whence their leader
occasionally bounds forward, with papers in his hand, and relieves
his feelings in short impulsive Welsh speeches, which, judging from
the way in which they are received, have a decidedly depressing
effect on the people.
There is an active Conductor of the Festival, who announces what
is going to take place in English and Welsh, and is perpetually
being disappointed by nothing coming of it. During all this, Wtn-
kvan's role is to preserve a negligent, patronising air, as he sits in
the Chair, giving an occasional condescending nod of approval to the
Conductor, when the latter appeals to him with a look; and when
there is a song sung, or a harp played, or a recitation made, Winbvan
closes his eyes, and gently pats the arm of the chair, as if it were
getting restive and had to be kept quiet.
Now and then he looks round, in a modest, dreamy, self-effacing
sort of manner, at the audience, as much as to say, " 1 taught 'em all
this, you know—that composition is a little thing of my own, of
course—they're really doing it very well—very well, considering,"
and then he bows gracefully to any performer, and courteously thanks
him or her, rising from his chair to do it, and glad of the opportunity for
a change of attitude, as he has to return to his former position imme-
diately afterwards, while the active Conductor announces the next
number of the entertainment, and is, as usual, disappointed. "Hugh
Owen will recite the Prize Poem," shouts the Conduotor, reading out
Number Seven (for example) in the programme. Applause. The
Conductor repeats this announcement in Welsh. Louder applause.
We look about to see where Hugh Owen is, naturally expecting

him to step up from the Artists' quarter—the green-room as it
were—on to the platform. Dead silence. No movement anywhere.
No sign of Hi'GU Owen. The Chairman moves his head slowly from
Bide to side, like the mechanical figure of Mr. Cobbett at Madame
Tcssauh's, and then raises his eyes towards the Qallery, as if trying
to penetrate into their midst, and force the conscience-stricken Hi uh
Owen to oome out of his ambush and declare himself.
The Conductor, getting very angry, shouts out what sounds like
"Hugh Owen, gr-rr-krr-krw-wch 1" But as this invocation hat
no Bort of effeot on Hion Owen, if he be there, or on anybody else,
the Conductor in despair passes on to the next.
"The successful competitor," he says, straining his voice so as to
be heard throughout the building, "the suocessful competitorfor the"
— (something or other which I can't catch, and can't hnd in my pro-
gramme)—" will now recite the" whatever it is. The Con-
ductor looks at Wtnevan, who, clearly knowing nothing at all about
it, assumes an air of smiling approbation, as though this were the
thing he had been waiting tor all along, and that he now wished us
all to understaud that he wa* quite brightening up at the prospeot
of the real treat that ib coming.
"Plas-ig-crr-wd-crr-squeloh?" shouts the Conductor, interroga-
tively, and throwing his voioe oleverly forward into the farthest
part of the building.
"Squeak!" answers a little, thin voice, issuing, apparently, from
somewhere just below the Conductor's toes, who immediately answers
sternly in English,
"Then come up,"—adding in Welsh something that sounds like
"Horslyvoidoid," whereat the ancient Minstrel Boys with the tin
cheese-plate decorations chuckle slily and mumble something to one
another, while the Beethoven- Bradlaugh Bard pushes back his long
hair and appears as if he were just exporting an inspiration, which,
however, on this occasion doesn't arrive in time. So he only frowns
on the subordinate Bards, whose decorations quiver with terror as they
collapse before the nod of the Master-siDger, and they once more
subside feebly among the waterproofs and umbrellas in the corner.
A harp is brought on to the platform, and two chairs, on one of which
somebody sits to play the instrument, while on to the other a small boy,
about seven years old, is lifted. He is dressed in a bobtail brown
ooat, and looks like Tom: Thumb about to recite "My name is
Nerval." Considerable applause greets his appearance.
"This," whispers Professor Edwakds to me, "is very remarkable.
He has a prize for a sort of improvisation. A tune is played, and he
has certain rhymes given him, and then he makes the verses as he
foes on." At least this is what 1 understand the Professor to mean,
do not like to bother him with questions, and so I "leave it at this"
and attend.
To an idiotic tnne, occasionally singing a whole verse, but
more often coming in wherever he can, the child, in a sharp, piping
treble, sings something in Welsh, generally contriving to finish on
the correct note. This is the competitor of whom all the other com-
Eetitors, with the exception of one old man, who is rather hard of
earing, were evidently bo frightened that they gave in, and let him
walk over. The exceptional old man comes forward to compete, but he
is a lamentable failure after the boy, who is at onoe decorated with a
ribbon and a small tin plate by one of the Ladies, and some one in
the hall gives him a sovereign.
The Conduotor announces the next—" Ap Williams will now sing
so-and-so." But Ap Williams won't do anything of the sort, at
least so I gather from a surly reply from the very back of the hall,
up in the Gallery, from which very safe position Ap Williams, I
fanoy, says something rather rude in Welsh to the Conductor, which
draws from the latter a crushing Welsh repartee. Wtnevan, seeing
that something is Wrong, peers up towards the Gallery and frowns
severely.
"We '11 pass over that Number," says the Conduotor, helplessly:
"and come to the next. Miss Uwillioih will ting ihe Eisteddfod
Song." Notabitof it: Conductor wrong again. Miss Gwillioth will
not do auylhing of the sort. A voice from the crowd says something
in Welsh, whereat the Gallery laugh, and upon this an animated
dialogue goes on for about live minutes between the energetic Con-
ductor on the platlorin and several people audible, but undetected,
in the body of tbe hall. Chairman puzzled, but helpless.
"We '11 pass over that Humber," says the Conduotor, making the
best of it, "and come to the next. Quartette Harp Competition.
The Quartette Harp Competitors will now play."
No they won't, not if they know it. Again the unfortunate Con-
duotor is quite out ot his reckoning, for only one of the Quartetlists
is present, and he explains that he can't play a quartette by him-
self, an objection which the Conduotor would be inclined to dispute
but for a nod of approbation from the Chairman, who, as something
of a musician himself, takes the Quartettist's side in the argument.
"1 can't stand ihie," whispers ".J. B." toHcoHlE. "Come and
have a whiff and a liquor-up."
They appeal to me. 1 reply that, as Winkvan's party, we can't
with propriety quit the platform.
Sappy Thought.—" 1 never will desert Mr. Micawber."
"les," says Uuohik, "but when something turns up——"
"1 Bhall turn it up altogether, and go home," cuts in " J. B."
"Why, it's not 'in it' with a third-rate music-hall."
During this there has been a pause. Audience impatient. Quar-
tettists do not appear. Sudden inspiration occurs to Conduotor.
There is an Eminent M.P. on the platform. Why shouldn't Eminent
M.P. address the crowd, just to fill up the time? Winevan, being
consulted, replies, "Certainly," and the Conduotor announces that
the Eminent M.P., who, perfectly aware of what is going to happen,
is trying to look as if he were quite unprepared and thoroughly taken
by surprise, will address the meeting.
Great applause. "J. I J." raps the, piano and calls out, " Mr. Gwyn
Williams will oblige 1" for whioh he is severely rebuked by a
frown from the Chairman, who is however comforted to think that
in the noise this ebullition passed unnoticed. The Eminent M.P.,
still preserving his expression of astonishment, as though he really
were the one person iu the world from whom a speech could not by
any possibility be demanded, steps forward from behind the Chair,
and faces the audience, which is so like.what Mr. Gladstone does
in the House, that the imitation is recognised and vociferously
applauded. Eminent M.P. beaming and pleasantly apologetic Of
course he says that the last thing he had expected was to be
called upon for a speech, but on such an occasion—and so forth.
General idea of speech, as far as 1 am able to. make out, is that
there are no people like the Welsh people—that all Europe owes
itB cultivation to the Welsh—that there are no handsome people
except the Welsh people—that they are the wisest, best, noblest,
oleverest, most artistic people on the face of the earth, &c, &o.
All whioh sentiment* are received individually and collectively with
every demonstration of unequivocal and unanimous approbation.
Eminent M.P. repeats apology for not having prepared a speech, but
they will welcome the sentiments as coming from his heart, which
are far better than, &c, &o.
[Next day, when London papers appear, I see with intense surprise
a column and a half headed "Mr. G wis Williams on Welsh Educa-
tion." So that was what we had been listening to! On comparing
notes with others on the platform, 1 find that none of us, including
Winetan, had any idea that the subject of the Eminent M.P.'s

discourse, to whioh we had been listening with such rapt attention,
was " Welsh Education." It never struck any of us at the time,
but directly we see it in the paper next day we all exclaim, as if
greatly relieved, "Oh, that was what he was talking about, was it!" ]
After this excitement, another pause. The Quartettists not having
arrived, the Conductor announces that " Williah Griffiths will
sing a song," which the said William Griffiths there and then
flatly refuses to do. A desultory dialogue in Welsh follows between
Conductor and some people in the hall; but nothing comes of it,
except that the Conduotor soratches the next two or three items out
of the programme, and then there is an awkward pause, which
startles Wtnrvan out of a gentle slumber, whereupon he suddenly
sits very erect in the Chair, and looks round the house with a severe
air, as though he had heard a snore somewhere, and should like to
make an example of anyone who had presumed to go to sleep during
an Eisteddfod.
Suddenly a tall man rushes out from behind the piano, where he
had artfully concealed himself, and, waving a paper, bawls out
something, which is evidently rhythmical, in Welsh. It is
clearly an inspiration, and he can't keep it to himself any longer. It
is not down in the programme; but you can't, of course, put an
inspiration into the programme, and fix it as " Number So-and-so,
Mr. Thingummy will oblige with an inspiration."^
Nobody seems to take any notice of the man with the inspiration,
who, having relieved his feelings (I think it was abuse of the boy
competitor, in strong Welsh), retires once more behind the piano,
and the Conductor, whose manner has been gradually becoming
more and more subdued, as of a good man unable to cope with an
adverse destiny, announces Number Fifteen, which is to be a tenor
solo by John Morgan. But somebody calls out that John
Morgan won't be here till four o'clock, and the Conductor is
on the point of throwing up the whole thing in sheer despair,
when the Beethoven - Bradlaugh Bard jumps up, and, followed
by a respectable - looking undertaker, also decorated with
ribbons and tin plates, which are so out of place on his sombre
attire as to suggest the notion that they must have been stuck
on him while he was asleep, rushes to the front, and reads a
long and apparently stirring speech in Welsh, in which he appears
to be denouncing everything and everybody with the greatest
violence, and I am wondering if he will end by attacking the Chair-
man, when he suddenly finishes, and retires with the decorated
undertaker to a back seat.
The audience look scared. Professor Edwards, with a pale and
awestruck face, whispers to me that this wild Bard is a chief Adju-
dicator, and that he has just been telling the audience that every-
thing sent in is so disgracefully bad that the Adjudicators won't
give a prize to anyone, that there will be no crowning of the Bard,
no chairing, no waving of swords, no nothing. From what I am
able to gather, the only successful competitor has been the small boy
with a shrill voioe, who stood on a chair and joined in with a harp
accompaniment whenever he could. "Surely," 1 say, "it isn't for this
they have this grand National Eisteddfod! 'Tisn't for this that an
Eminent M.P.,"
"Come on, Sportsman I" says Hughte Gbtllbton; "this is the
most undefeated bosh I 've ever heard. And—I say—there's a
spiffing lunch at Dr. Richards's. Wtnevan 's coming, and he's
got the Eminent M.P. to take the Chair in his absence."
The hall is gradually being deserted. The rain is penetrating,
and umbrellas are opened freely in all directions, as if the damp
weather had suddenly forced a orop of gigantio fungi. Everyone on
the platform having heartily applauded the Resolution which moves
the eminent M.P. into the Chair, artfully takes advantage of the
temporary confusion consequent on the shifting of places, to turn
the Old Minstrel Boys out of their corner, and seize the waterproofs
and umbrellas. Then most of us sneak quietly off the platform by the
side-doors, either on the pretence of fetching somebody, or of speak-
ing to somebody in the body of the building, and so we manage to get
away. The last I see of the Eisteddfod, for the present, is an audito-
rium half full, a melancholy-looking platform deserted by everybody
except the Eminent M.P. in the Chair,—with the table before him,
on which stand the conventional and awfully dispiriting bottle of
cold water and tumbler,—who is inwardly anathematising_WTNKVAN
and his own popularity which has tied him to this wearisome task,
and wondering if there's any chance of getting any luncheon, or,
if not, if anyone will remember that he is starving, and send him
up something from the town. The still undaunted Conductor is trying
to make himself heard above the rustling of dresses, the shuffling of
feet, and the chattering of more than a third of the assembly going
out for refreshment. The Old Minstrel Boys have vanished; they
have allowed themselves ten minutes for inspiration. Freddie
Mickham rouses Johnnie Pbosser from a sound sleep, just in time
to save him from tumbling off his chair, and in the pelting rain we
escort the Ladies through the slosh downhill to our destination
Happy Thought.—Luncheon at Dr. Richards's. Saved! Saved!!
Saved ill The Johnnies turn up here, but they are so utterly
exhausted by the mental and physical strain imposed upon them by

a four-hours' attendance at the Eisteddfod, that they are harmless,
quiet, and go steadily to work at pickled salmon, ham, grouse,
champagne-cup, jellies, and old brown sherry. "Wonderful old
brown sherry that!" says Johnnie Prosser. They are the first
words he has spoken for three-quarters of an hour, since we first
sat down to lunch. "Capital prescription, Doctor," adds " J. B.,"
addressing our hospitable host, who beams again as he rubs his
hands, and, entering into the fun of the thing, tells us that this
particular brown sherry is " highly recommended by the faoulty."
"Is it ?" cry The Johnnies, one after the other: and all make a
rush to the sideboard. They are recovering, and showing signs of
life.
"ROBERT" EN COLERE1
What a grumblin diskontented World this is becoming I
Everybody seems a grumblin and a growlin!
Fust it's hinoum Tacks, then its Sea Side Land Ladies with the
Tea and the Wine, then its the poor
Survent Gals, that's allers a good
subjeot for Grumblers, but I did
think there was one class of Her
Msjesty's Subjects, namely Waiters,
who, caring nolhink about a Nincum
Tacks and such like greevences,
was pretty well satisfied with things
as they are.
And now I 'm ashamed to say we
has a grumblin Waiter a writin to
the Pell Mell Gazettel and a grum-
blin 'cos he don't git so large a
share of the Fees at his Hotel as the
Hed Waiter!
Why in course he don't any more
than a meer private Solger gits as
muoh as a full blown Capting I
A pretty sort of a specimen of a
perfeshunal Waiter he must be,
when he meanly diwulges the most
sacredest secrets of a ighly onerabel
calling merely in hopes of git ting
more fees.
Shame on such a Waiter!
Is his aspirations confined to
LuccaY I'd rayther be a donkey
and bray at the moon, as Brutus says, than such a Waiter!
I am myself of course an Head Waiter. Slar var long Dear.' as
a yung French Gassong of my aquaintanoe says, but by wot slow
and weary and slippery steps have I arrived at my egsolted per-
sition!
Did I grumble, when I was a mere green horn, wen I seed the
Heads of my perfesshun pocketing all the Fees? Suttenly not, and
for why? Becos 1 knew my turn would cum sum day, and cum it
has, and I now reaps the arvest as I sowed so patiently years and
years ago.
To judge large things by small. Think of the poor dewle of a
breefless Barryster when he begins his hungry career. What keeps
his Sperrits up but the thort of the Wool Sack or the Weakly Dis-
patch Box? See how pleased he is to pocket his little fees when he
gits a chance, and how pashently he sets on an aid seat with a large
empty blue bag, day after day, and munth after munth, in hopes of
a chance of hatchin sumthink that will pay his rent or even his
Larndress.
Does he grumble at the Turney General or the Slisster General
taking all the plums and leaving nim ardly enuff plane pudden to
keep body and Bole together? Not a bit of it.
On the contrary, he likes to hear of the immense fees they are
pocketing, coz he knows, or at any rate hopes, if he's careful and
civil and attentive to the Atturneys and their ugly daughters, if in
fact he resembels a reel good Waiter, that is, smiles at everybody
and has no back bone in partickler, his turn is sure to come.
I reelly amost blushes for my perfesshun wen a Waiter can be
found to so demeen hisself as to menshun such a word as "tips "!
and the sooner he quits the persishun he grumbles at and disgraces
and jines the low herd of sportin profits and touts, or goes in for
practising at the Bar of a low Pub, the better it will be for all
concerned.
He has evidently mistook his wocashun. He cannot rise to the
dignerty of the sittewashun as he has hitherto held. He lacks the
Jatience and the humility and the faith and the opefulness of a
unier Waiter.
I wish him no harm, tho' he has Btruck a blow as all us Head
Waiters feels wery sewerely, but, on the contrary, I hopes that in
sum inferier stashun of life, more fitted to his umbel abilities, he may
meet his dew reward. Robert.

MRS. R. IN A NEW PLACE.
Mr DEAR NErHEW,
Mr. Hackson has been as good as his word to Livrr and
myself. He promised to take us to a French bathing-place which
we should like ever so much better than Bullown, and he has done
it. He acted as our Currier all the way, which saved us so much
trouble in looking after ourselves, as he was always before us. Well,
the place he took us to is called Rosendael, the Dale of Roses, because
there are so many jardangs day plants, as they call 'em in French,
in the pretty little village which we walked through on Sunday,
though of course the rose season is over now. When Mr. Hackson
told us that we must first go to Dunkirk to get to Rosendael, I
thought he was joking, as I own I had always thought that Dunkirk
was in Scotland; and I was right after all, as it was in Scotland
till Charles the Second sold it to the French, and of course sent
it over to them, carriage paid, and delivered it and set it down
on the coast just where it is now. It's a delightful old town, with
a fine church dictated to Scent Hullo, and a tower with a carry-
along in it. The carry-along is a set of bells which plays a tune
feebly every half-hour, and sounds like a second-hand musical box
on a shelf.
The Dunkirkers are the respectablest people; there are very few
song cutlets, as the French say, among them. And as to civility, they
might be natives of Sweet Civil in Spain, instead of Frenchmen at
Dunkirk. When the Oossoons hand anything to you, or take it away,
they always say, "Mair see," which, as I observed to Mr. Hack-
son, proves that the Dunkirkers still keep their Scotoh, as evidently
"Mair see'" means that there was something mair coming, and eo
there always was. The Tarble doat at the Grand Hotel at Dunkirk,
in the Rude Kappysangs, that's the name of the principal street,
was very good. The breakfast and dinner at the Restowrongs
called the Kaffy days Arcards " were," as Mr. Hackson facetiously
■aid, "quite first chop," though, of course, he meant fillies, which,
I am bound to say, I refused to touch at first, thinking that fillies
must be something to do with horses.
When we first arrived, we drove in an open vulture right
through the town to the Casino (I objected to enter such a place,
but Mr. Haceson told us that it was quite a different thing to what
the Magistrates won't license in London) at Rosendael, and imagine
our disappointment when a most respectable and nice-spoken lady
told Mr. Haceson,—who interrupted what she said in French to us.
though most of it was quite ineligible to me.—that the Season had
finished on the fifteenth of September, that the Hotel and the Cure-
us-all (which is the salutary department) was shut up, that there
wus nobody here, and the best thing we could do was to go back to
the town, and come out to the bathing by tramway in the morning, j
This we did, and most enjoyable it was: the tramway, price two-
pence, took us in ten minutes to the bathing-machines, and the
weather was so hot that we sat under sunshades, and actively break-
fasted all frisky (as the Italians Bay) out in the open air, eating such
icheaters, which is French for oysters, as I 've never tasted in my
life before, at two franks a dozen. They are the same sort as the
celebrated wheaters of Dustend. on the Bulging Coast. It is a most
healthy plaoe, being famed for its general celebrity.
The sands at Rosendael are three times as long and as broad as those
of Ramsgate; in fact, they are very fine sands, and get into your boots
in spite of everything. At Dunkirk, in the Plarse Jang Bar—so called
after a great naval hero, a sort of Brigadier, whose statute, in a sort of
chandelier dress of the seventeenth sentry, with a sword in his hand,
like the piotures of Richard the Third at the Battle of Wandsworth
—is a market for everything, from laoe and saucepans to pigs'-feet
and cabbages, fruit and flowers. It lasts nearly all the morning, and
I wish a certain noble Duke could just see it, for one cannot help sub-
stituting a caparison between it and Covent-Garden Market. At the
latter plaoe it is all muck and muddle, but at Dunkirk you can walk
or drive round it, three abreast, at any time; and, before two in the
afternoon, the whole thing, except a few flower-women with baskets,
has disappeared as if by magic, like Saladin's palace, leaving, as
the Swamp of Avon says, "not a rag behind." Not a sign that
there's been such a thing as a market, not an odour anywhere, and
no refusal lying in muck-heaps about the streets, and this, too, in
very hot weather, which, at this time of year, is known in France as
Sam Martin's Summer, though I had always, myself, heard of Sam
Martin as a Judge; yet, when I oome to think of it, no doubt his
summing-up was called a summery because it was so clear, and the
prisoner, as Mr. Haceson, who knows most legal lapidaries, sayB,
"got it hot" in the Summer Allsizes; so, putting this and that
together there is a fair reason for calling it Sam Martin's summery
weather.
Mr. Hackson says he is sure that during the regular season this
place is far better than Bullown—which I'm inclined to call Fly-
Bullown— and much more of a genuine change for English people,
who can get here just as easily as to the other place, for you start
the same way, and go through to Kallous; and supposing you are
the early bird, and take the 7'40 a.m. train, from Victoria, and get
to Kallous at 11, or thereabouts, by the twin-ship the Kally-tvoo-
for-her, and then you have an hour and a half to revive and eat the
excellent lunch which is provided for the travellers at the Buffy,
and after that you walk up to the Town Gar, and go off by the 1'30
train for Gravel Lines, which is the direot root, without any change,
to our final desecration, which was Dunkirk. Mr. Hackson says, that
though he likes a direct line, yet he finds he can't go anywhere,
however direct; without ohange, and plenty of it, from a Sue to a
Frank. A Sue is a halfpenny, and a Frank is tenpence, which shows
what value the French put on the male sex as compared with us poor
women, who, in this country, seem to do most of the work, and be
perfect smudges.
Mr. Haceson was quite right, and next year he promises to take
us there in the Bathing-season, when I mean to buy for Lawt and
myself regular bathing-costumes, and come out in Spanish Flotillas.
Mr. Hackson says there-'s still signs of the Rosendael part of Dun-
kirk having been originally Scotch, because there is so much that is
Sandy about it. But that's one of his caramboles. Yours,
M. A. R.
P.S.—I forgot to say that there are plenty of millionnaires about
in full uniform, and we saw a lot of distillery praotice on Monday
afternoon from the rampants. Mr. Hackson says that they were
firing shells, which is very likely, being so near the sea where they
can be got so cheap. But when Mr. H. told us that they were only
potting shrimps, 1 saw he was at his caramboles again. I like a man
to be serious sometimes, and Mr. H. is too much of a "jesting
Pilot," as the nautical people say, for me.

Where'8 Barnum?—Under the heading, "A Curious Faot in

"single-cell creature" Well—one "sell," if it's a good one,
will take us all in. This (if read between the lines) is perhaps what

The aromatic and spice-laden Eastern Zephyrs blowing now some-
what boisterously through the jewelled ivory-lattice down His
Highness's back, with a sudden graceful and charming sneeze, he
slid with perfect ton right across the polished jasper floor to the
opposite side of the presence-chamber, where, drawing up with a
oourteous jerk, he deposited his head in the ooal-souttle, and smiled
at us amiably. This little incident naturally gave rise to some quiet
subaoid humour, on our part, as to the financial embarrassments of
His Highness's impecunious father, a piece of banter to which,
with excellent breeding, he rejoined, by turning a double back-
somersault that took him again into the very middle of the rose-
coloured-satin feather-bed, on which he had previously been
longing.
We smiled, hastily, and the conversation then turned upon inferior
tinned oysters. The Khedive said, when they were bad, he did not
like them. We reminded him that, if steeped in a powerful disin-
fectant, and swallowed hurriedly, with plenty of cayenne and chili-
vinegar, and peppermint-drops taken after them, they could some-
times be got down. He said this was true. We then asked him the
amount of his washing-bill. To this he made no rejoinder, but
laughed pleasantly for about three-quarters of an hour. Altogether,
we spent a most delightful morning.

A Wink and a Sight.
In an account of an interview held with the ex-Khedive Ismail

affairs, especially those of expenditure and finance, one of the Times'
Correspondents notices a rather remarkable knack which Ismail is
addicted to. Be " generally closes one eye when particularly ani-
mated.'^ "Very likely. And, perhaps, he is occasionally so carried
away with ungovernable vivacity, that, in the extremity of enthu-
siasm, he applies the termination of one of his thumbs to the tip of
his nose, ana extends his four fingers.
ASKAM AND ANSWER'EM.
Unijku the heading, "Another Egypt," in our Number dated
Sept. 16th we made a few playful remarks on the state of "a town
called Atkatn, in Furness, and intimated our opinion that the Duke
of Buccleuch, being interested in the place, could, if he would, set
matters right in the above-mentioned locality. The idea, of course,
was, "There's nothing, at all events, lost by Askam," and we
expressed our earnest wish that the petitioners might obtain what
they prayed for.
The Duke's agents, however, now write to inform us that "Hie
Grace is not specially interested in Askam, but he has always lent
his aid and assistance in any work or object which was for the bent lit
of that part of Furness," and that for the state of things represented
as existing in Askam, His Grace "is not in any way responsible."
We are delighted to hear it, as the moral of the article in ques-
tion, as regards the Aakamites in relation to the Duke, could he
summed up in what a native of Fume** said to an ignorant traveller
who thought he was in Scotland: "You've only got to Askam."
Exactly: you've only got to ask him.
Of course, anybody living in a perpetual Furness must expect to

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HISTORY RE-VIEWED.
By Jfhytt Washcher.
No. 1.—Henry the Eighth, the Model Husband.
Gentle and genial, oonsiderate and sociable, with a strong love of
romance, such was Henry the Eighth. From his earliest years he
was particularly sweet-tempered. He had but one blemish. He was
incurably shy in the presence of ladies, and consequently invariably
shunned their society. But although he avoided the sex, he was
devoted to the individual—he loved with all the fervour of a young and
pure heart—Catherine of Aragon. He determined to address her, and
seeking the assistance of his elder brother, Arthur, wrote her a love
letter so full of tender compliments, so crammed with passionate

Thb Koyal Caudles.—" Henry Tudor, tu dors!"
expressions of affection, that Catherine was wooed and won
simultaneously. She immediately accepted the writer of the note,
but her reply was addressed to Arthur! By some terrible oversight
the elder brother had signed for the younger! But, as Henry
pointed out to his senior, there was but one thing to be done. "I
must sacrifice myself," said the unfortunate Prince with tears in his
large blue eyes; "she must not suffer. Artie, she is yours! May
you be happy—very happy! All for her! All for her!" and
leaving Hampton Court in a very frenzy of woe, he travelled to
Windsor.
Prince Arthur and Catherine of Aragon were married, but
scarcely had the lady become a bride, before she found herself a
widow. On his death-bed her husband told her the story of the
fatal mistake. "Hal is a dear good fellow," said Prince Arthur,
in conclusion. "Mind, Kate, you have promised to marry him for
my sake. Let me join your palms together. So! I die in peace!"
And holding the hands of his brother and his wife in the same grasp,
he smiled a sweet smile, and calmly yielded up his spirit.
Shortly after this, Henry (who had now become a monarch) and
Catherine were married with the utmost magnificence. During
the honeymoon the happy pair merited their conventional title,
but as time grew on, Catherine showed her character in its
true colours. She was oaprioious, suspicious, and sulky; but,
above all, she wub an inveterate nagger. During the day her hus-
band was able to avoid her, cares of State claiming his exclusive
attention, but when he retired to rest he had to listen to his wife's
curtain lectures. For hours and hours would Catherine rate her
liege lord about his faults of omission and commission. Now it
was that he had been lax in attending to his religious observances.
Henry promised to renew his zeal, and the very next day wrote a
book which so pleased the Pope that his Holiness immediately
conferred upon nim and his issue the title of "Defender of the
Faith." Then it was that the monks were too wealthy. Catherine
was sure "the friars were growing too fat!" Again, to please his
wife, Henry the very next morning abolished all the monasteries—
a proceeding which (at the time) caused some ill-feeling. In fact,
there was nothing that the fond husband would not do, and did not
do, to please and conciliate his querulous and irritable helpmate.
At last she insisted upon a separation, and Henry tearfully con-
sented to let her go. And from this point the unhappy monarch
was induced to become a party to a series of frauds which have
handed down his name to posterity attached to a reputation for
cruelty and fickleness utterly foreign to his true nature. According
to history, Henry was all that was bad; as a matter of fact, he was
everything that was good.
Catherine, after leaving Henry, with the assistance of Cardinal
Wolsey (known amongst his intimates as " the meek Ecclesiastic,"
on account of his extreme amiability and lack of resolution), obtained
a divorce. No sooner had she secured it, than she wished to return to
her husband. How was it to be done? A re-marriage would have
oaused endless merriment by holding up the parties to public ridi-
cule. Henry, who had been inconsolable when Catherine left him, at
last hit upon a plan by which his first love and himself could become
re-united. He suggested that Catherine should return to Court
in disguise! The Queen entered into the plot with energy, and
assuming a Frenchified manner, and a coif which completely con -
cealed her hair, appeared at Hampton Court under the title of
"Anne Boleyn." She was soon afterwards re-married in this name,
and all went on well. The King was for a short time supremely
happy. But at last the curtain lectures recommenced, the Queen
on this occasion troubling her husband about foreign instead of
domestic affairs. Thus it was that, to quiet her, Henry had to
rush into all sorts of expenses. It was Catherine who insisted
upon the Field of the Cloth of Gold, and she also was the real
originator of the wars between England and Spain, and France and
England.
The birth of her second daughter, Elizabeth, occurred about this
time, and there were great rejoicings in the Palace. Alas! the Queen
took offence at the good and accomplished Sir Thomas More calling
the baby "Betsy"; and, after securing the execution of that
admirable statesman (for Henry was ever a most indulgent
husband), retired into private life. The King was at his wit's-end
to account for her sudden disappearance, and consulted the Privy
Council. It was decided that a report should be spread that " Anne
Boleyn" was dead, and, this being done, rumour immediately
added sensational details, in the shape of a story of an imprisonment
in the old Fortress of London, an exeoution on Tower Hill, and other
ridiculous elaborations.
But soon Catherine wanted to return. Henry acceded to her
request with joy. Again she came in disguise, now calling herself
"Jane Seymour." Her son Edward was born. She grew tired of
Court life, and again disappeared, this time without leaving her
address. Once more Henry had to resort to stratagem, and to
announce the lamented decease of "Jane Seymour." And from
this time the Queen was continually appearing and disappearing.
She seems to have taken a delight in giving an entertainment after
the fashion of Mr. Woodin. Now she assumed the character of a
heavy Dutchwoman, and christened herself " Anne of Cleves." She
was married in due course, and then vanished, to reappear suddenly
as a frivolous little lady she called "Catherine Howard." Again
she was married, and again disappeared. Once more it was necessary
to spread the report of her death, and once more rumour invested
the tale with ghastly elaborations. She had just assumed the cha-
racter of a very old woman, a sort of female Hip Van Winkle, whom
she called " Catherine Parr," when her husband, to whom she had
been married no less than Bix times, worn out by continual nagging
and limitless curtain lectures, suddenly died. His last words were,
"Kate, dear Kate, it was very good of you to choose Catherine as
the christian name of three of your clever and amusing impersona-
tions. You know I was always making mistakes when I had to call
you either Jane or Anne." And with these grateful accents falling
from his poor, parched month, and a gentle smile playing upon
his poor, pale lips, the good-natured and well-beloved monarch
expired.
From the above it will be seen that the master-passion of Henry
the Eighth was devotion to his wife. Naturally thrifty, religious,
and humane, he was more than once induced to commit deeds of
extravagance, sacrilege, and harshness at her instigation. But these
untoward acts were few and far between, and he hastened to make
reparation the moment they were committed. Thus, whenever he
was induced to behead a married nobleman, he invariably addressed
a letter of condolence and sympathy to the widow, timed to reach
her on the evening of her lord's execution. This did he because he
was so essentially a family man himself that he could not bear to
hear of pain in the domestic circle of others. It would, perhaps,
have been better for his fame had he shown more firmness in his
dealings with his Queen; but, if he had, he might possibly have
lost his right to the title he has so justly earned, that of "the Model
Husband.'7
Leave and Licence.—A Theatrical Company, attempting to break
the dreadful and time-honoured dulness of Herne Bay by giving
dramatio performances, were fined about twelve pounds, and
solemnly cautioned by the Bench, who had previously refused a
licence to the building. The Company didn't herne much at this
place. At Bamsgate a licence was twice lost for the Promenade Pier,
because in the first instance the notice was posted on the wrong
church door, and in the second, instance it was fixed to awinuw
instead of a door. These are the things that give dignity to II ,
Licensing System, and make it respected.

THE SPENDTHRIFT'S GUIDE.—No. VIII.
After doing so much for the benefit and gratification of his fellow creatures, the Spend-
thrift is quite entitled to do something for the gratification of himself, without considering
publio opinion, or the greatest happiness of the greatest number. One of the most dis-
agreeable results of possessing property is the necessity of making a will, which brings you
face to face with the word finis, and compels you to please nobody, while trying to please
everybody. The best way out of this difficulty is to please yourself. In disposing of his
wealth, the Spendthrift will select two or more persons in different grades of life, who must
be utter strangers to himself, and to each other. He will select a King or Queen, a landed
proprietor, and a capitalist. The King or Queen must not be poor or insignificant, the
landed proprietor must be the absolute lord of countless acres, and the capitalist must be
the owner of many millions sterling. In selecting these representatives of three classes, the
Spendthrift must be careful that the landed
proprietor and the capitalist, at least, have
never disgraced themselves or their pro-
perty, by any act of public or private
generosity. The King or Queen may be
allowed a little latitude in this respect, on
account of their position, which compels
them to do many things which they could
avoid as private individuals; but the quali-
fication of the two others must be strictly
adhered to. Having made the necessary
inquiries, the Spendthrift will divide his
wealth in the following fashion. He will
give his land to the landed proprietor; he
will give his cash, securities, and funded
property to the capitalist, and he will give
his jewels, pictures, houses, statues, and
other valuables to the King or Queen. He
will reserve just enough money to pay for
his modest funeral, and to write over his
grave the following inscription:—
"He fpent not wisely, but too well."
IN MY NEW VICAR'S TIME.
(Popular Curate's Comic Song, at the Drill
Hall, Derby.)
"But a Curate had advantages. He is
received as a gentleman, and plays lawn-tennis.
He ought to do it with the poor children as well
as with the ladies. He can marry if he likes.
A Birmingham shoeblack became a Scripture-
reader, a Curate, and married a lady of title in
London."—Rev.J.GsDOB at the Church Congrcts.
Talk not to me of vanished years,
When I was underpaid,
And all my earthly hopes and fears
Hung on the " Curates' Aid."
For now at tea-fights am I seen,—
At tennis lead the van,
And as I skip across the green
Am dubbed "a gentleman."
Chorus.
So, Apron'd Dean, with manner coy,
Flump Bishop in his prime,
Ne'er knew the fun that I enjoy
In my new Vicar's time.
Though hostile critics sometimes peach
On one too prone to spoon;
Though only housemaids hear me preach
On Sunday afternoon—
One privilege I boast in life
That must the layman strike—
While years he waits to wed his wife,
I marry when I like.
Chorus.
So now e'en Army Swells I meet
With confidence sublime:
I 've known—a fact—Dragoons retreat
In my new Vicar's time!
Would you my shoe-black days bemoan?
My early lot reverse?
Reflect!—I now a Duohess own,
For better or for worse!
And if my titled bliss you doubt.
And urge some happier state,
As Mr. Gedoe points neatly out,
I can but emigrate.
Chorus.
So mourn no more the Curate's lot
As theme too sad for rhyme;
If such 'twas once, by Jove, 'tis not
In my new Vicar's time!
The Law's delays are proverbial. 8o will
be the New Law Courts' delays. Peter
O'Grady says, "If the New Law Courts
aren't ready soon, they '11 be old by the time
they 're finished, and will have to be closed
before they 're opened."

A LESSON TO THE BRITISH LION.
To Matthew Arnold hark,
With both ears all avidity;
That Matthew—a man of mark-
Says, "Cultivate Luoidity."
"Civil Courage " the Germans lack;
(Query—what can mean that quiddity ?)
But England's especial drawback
Is a certain want of " Luoidity."
In " Morality " France most fails
To exemplify rigidity;
The defect that England ails
Must be owned to be "Luoidity."
The Salvation Army shines
In devoted intrepidity;
But the fault of its valiant lines
Is the foible of no Lucidity.
The Puseyite phalanx glows
With a most intense calidity;
But the heat of the movement throws
Not a gleam or spark of Lucidity.
There is genius, love, charm, no doubt,
In Ritualistic floridity,
But what would have snuffed it out
Would have been a ray of Lucidity.
Boast beef is excellent meat,
Of most extreme sapidity;
Plum-pudding is nice to eat,
But it doesn't produce Lucidity.
John Bull is a worthy old wight,
Though he sometimes behaves with stupidity,
Uninspired with Sweetness and Light,
And, in short, nearly void of Lucidity.
"The Abt of Pluck."—Mr. Gush Harris, expert in
theatrical advertising, daily impresses on the public that
his chief object at Drury Lane is to show how "crime,
treachery, and falsehood" are invariably punished—
somehow. A sublime moral, whioh should bring whole
families from their hearths and homes to learn the great

"You find the place greatly changed?" said Rip's guide.
"Yes," returned Van Winkle, "I do. Your inventions are
simply marvellous. But never mind them. I want to see the people."
"High life or low life P"
"Well, the class from whioh I sprang myself—the hard-working,
honest, sober artisan."
Rip's guide smiled, for he remembered that in his youth his com-
panion had never joined the Blue Ribbon Army.
"We will look for them. Had you awakened fifty years ago—say
in 1882—you would have found them living in far better style than
their so-called richer neighbours. They spent a great deal more in
luxuries than the classes above them."
"Indeed!" returned Rip. "And what have they been doing since?"
"Oh, striking and combining, or rather they did strike and
combine up to about a dozen years ago."
"And where are they now r "—" We will see."
Rip's guide led his aged companion to one of the new Electric Rail-
way Stations. The platform was crowded with porters, engine-drivers,
ana guards, busily engaged in performing their various duties.
"Why," exclaimed Mr. Van Winkle, after he had. inspected
the employ it for a few minutes, " I do believe they are all Chinese!
There's not an Englishmen amongst them I"
"Very true," responded his companion. "The Celestials get about
a third of the wages of the late officials, and do double the work.
However, they are rather a nuisance. They are so fond of crowding.
They have settled in Golden Square, where no less than 245,000 of
them are encamped in the enclosure!
Rip walked away, and came to a large building which was in course
of erection. There were scores of bricklayers, masons, and carpenters
working their hardest. "Dearme!" cried Van Winkle. "Whatan
extraordinary set of people 1 Why, they are oovered with feathers!"
"Yes," acquiesced his companion, "they are all North American
Indians. They are not bad fellows when they are sober. But when
they take more 'fire-water' than is good for them, they have a
nasty habit of scalping the nearest policeman!"
A little further on the two friends came to some engineering
works.' "Why, where are the navvies?" asked Rip. "Surely,
they have not given up work?"
Oh, yes, they have," was the reply. "They struck some ten years
ago, and joined the miners and stonemasons. Their places have been
supplied by some native New Zealanders and a number of Zulu Kaffirs.
The new workmen are quiet enough when they are not wearing their
war-paint." By this time the evening was closing in, and the lamps
were beginning to be lighted. Rip discovered that the lamplighters,
the postmen, the policemen, and even the soldiers were all of "nigger"
extraction. "This is very Btrange," said Rip. "But I suppose
this state of things is peculiar to London."
"Not at all," replied his companion, "the country is equally in
the hands of the native. AU our farm-labourers are Egyptian
fellahs, and the hop-picking and the hay-making is undertaken by
wandering tribes of Bedouin Arabs and low-caste Hindustani."
"Dear me! and so the English workmen have disappeared?"
"Entirely! They have been forced out of the market by foreign
competition. Personally, I am sorry for it, but the great employers
of labour are overjoyed. They declare that now they can rely upon
having their work done punctually and economically."
Rip was silent for a moment; then he said, "But I suppose the
British Workmen do exist somewhere?"
"Oh, yes; they do exist." was the answer. "But I am afraid, if
you want to see them, that the rules of the establishment in whioh they
dwell will not permit their appearance this evening^"
"Rules of the establishment!" eohoed Rip. "Why, they surely
have not been sent to prison?"
"Oh, dear no," was the reassuring reply, "they are only in—the
Workhouse!" ======______

CONQUEST FOR EVER!
Mr. Geoboe Conquest was hopping about thoughtfullv in his
favourite frog attitude, on the 8urrey side of the river. Now and
then he stood on his head, or dived down into a coal-cellar, coming
up again through a chimney,
and leaping from a roof on
to a lamp-post. He was
evidently meditating a great
coup. Suddenly he cried,
"I have it!" and jumping
from the electric telegraph
wire, on which he had been
twinging, up on to the sky-
light of the theatre, he des-
cended safely to the stage,
placed himself on a trap,
and shot up, through the floor,
into Mr. Paul Mebitt's
private room.
"Aha!" cried Mr. Con-
quest in the hoarse voice of
double - bottle - imp power,

"My Monkey's up! 1 '11 kill yer!" "'sit down, and have a

eccentric mode of arrival than was the good. St. Anthony by the fiends
who tried to distract his attention from his " old black book."
"Cigar be blowed!" replied Mr. Conquest with his most demon-
iacal chuckle, suddenly leaping on to the table, scattering the papers
right and left, and squatting, all in a heap, exactly opposite his
partner. "A cigar! while you are making up the 'returns'!
Pooh!"
Mr. Mebitt sat back in his chair.

"Like the Fat Boy in Pickwick," interrupted Mr. Paul
Mebitt, quietly securing the paper-knife.
"No, Little Paul," hissed the Demon Manager, his eyes glaring
with the strange fire of an eccentric inspiration. "Not like the Fat
Boy—but like a Darwinesque creation, an Evolutionist idea."
"Quite so," observed Mr. Mebitt. "I've seen you go through
any number of evolutions—in Pantomime and Burlesque.
"Ah!" cried his Goblin partner, "but this time it will he a
Darwinesque-Edgar-Allan-Poetic-Creation in real serious Melo-
Drama. Something between Quilp, Quasimodo, The Dougal
Creature, and an acrobat. You must assist me with the plot. I

"You shall!" cried Mr. Mebitt, enthusiastically. "You've
been a Moving Mushroom, an Octopus, a Talking Tree, and a Walk-
ing Head, and now you shall be a Man-Monkey!" They locked the
door, drew out their Horrorscopes, burnt blue fire, invoked the
spirits from the nearest shades, and .... the drama was done.
Not more repulsive in appearance or conduct than Quilp,—
Johnnie Clabke as Quilp we mean,—or Quasimodo, Mr. Conquest

clined to recognise more of the Monkey" than the Man in Mr.
Conquest's impersonation, but in this, Act VI., the densely-
crowded House saw nothing to laugh at, and remained in a state of
terrible suspense till the tragedy was completed, and the Curtain
had descended on the escape of the Man-Monkey through the con-
servatory-window.
In the Seventh Act, moving from house to house, without

furniture-vans, is made very easy. Here the sensational hair-
breadth-risks encountered by the suffering, ill-used heroine, and her
irritating!y weak young man, are admirably contrived, and when
the aforesaid weak young man suddenly becomes physically powerful,
and just manages to prevent the heroine from falling between two
tumble-down houses, while he is clinging on to a beam and holding
her suspended in the air in his grasp of iron, the excitement has
reached its climax, and only one disappointment is felt, and generally
expressed, which is, that Mr. Conquest, as the Man-Monkey, does
not have to do the climbing over those dangerous beams, and so
practically assist in saving the heroine's life, or in hurling a villain
or two off a plank, instead of spending the last few minutes of his
melodramatic existence groaning about affidavits and grovelling in a
cellar, only to be brought out to die, in the best possible dispositions,
when all sensation is at an end. If Zacky could even now be only
worked into that sensational finish, the value of the piece would be
materially enhanced. It is thoroughly well played all round, the
honours being carried off by Mr. C. Cruixshasks as Abel Hockley,
an artistic performance by Miss Bella Tithebadge as Ruth, a very
difficult part, and by Miss Alice Ratnob as Phillis, a much-enduring
young Lady, whose spmpathetic tone and gentle bearing forcibly
recalled the best performances of Miss Ltdia Foote, the accepted
model for all heroines in distress.
In consequence of the death of the Baronet,
early in the piece, the principals are in deep
mourning for an entire Act afterwards. This
is all right for villains of the blackest dye,
but not for the innocent lambs.
Some improvement might be made in Act V.,
where the interior of the Holborn Restaurant
is shown. It is a long time since we were
that most respectably conducted dining

establishment, but a considerable change must
have come over the spirit of the place if it is
frequented by the class of people represented
at the Surrey as dining there. There is, for in-
stance, a far from quiet party on the friendliest
terms with a bibulous looking waiter who,
after two consommateurs have disappeared
without payment, complainsof "another bilk"
—as.if business were conducted on a somewhat
unremunerative plan at the Holborn. Then,
belonging to the abovementioned party, is an
elderly Lady who, on sitting down at one of
the dining tallies, at once orders "gin and
peppermint, because she has the spasms;"
and finally, when /.achy appears, there is cham-
pagne swigging, waiter-hugging, toast-proposing by the principal
characters, all standing about talking and walking, and taking up
the entire restaurant as if it belonged to them, while a carver, a
couple of waiters, the orchestra seated up above, and two mild
sets of diners, pay no sort of attention to the eccentric proceedings
of these visitors,—and, on second thoughts, if these last don't object,
we can't possibly have anything to say on the subject—except that
this scene should not be taken as "realistic," but as most decidedly
"idealistic." However, this is a mere detail. The piece is clearly
a "draw," as it ought to be at the Surrey when there is plenty of
Conquest and a considerable amount of Meritt in it.

PRINTERS' ERR0R8.
Mistakes will happen in the best regulated Printing Establish-
ments. These two are not bad specimens of a muddle from the
Daily Telegraph of Friday last:—
"It was unanimously agreed, yesterday, at the Meeting of the Court of Com-
mon Council, to present an address of thanks and congratulation to General
Wolseley and Admiral Seymour for their conduct in Egypt, and that they
be invited to the Guildhall on their return to receive the knocked him down
several times, and after some days he died. The prisoner was remanded."
We rubbed our eyes, and read it twice. Then we went on to trace
the connecting link, which was found in the following paragraph:—
"At Marlborough Street, William Hioob was accused of causing the
death of Henry Jones, in Cecil Street, St. Martin's Lane. There had been
some quarrelling, and Hioos wished to fight Jones, who seemed to treat the
matter good-humouredly, but when the man came forward he documents. Sir
Bbauchamp Seymour will likewise receive a sword of honour and the
freedom of the City."
This second is the better of the two. "He documents" might be
a new American verb. But Sir Bbauchamp Seymour likewise
receiving a sword because Higqs hod fought Jones, reads like part
of a gome of consequences.

A Kocky Descent.
A HANDBOOK OP KNOWLEDGE.
No. IX.—Railways.
Pabt II.—The Platform,
Q. Having at length procured his ticket, what is the passenger's
next proceeding?
A. That depends upon circumstances, and the Station he may
he starting from. If it he a Terminus, or important Junction, he
will probably have to start on a lengthy exploring expedition, in
search of his proper platform.
Q. But can he not at once make inquiry in the proper quarter?
A. There is no recognised and reliable "proper quarter," for such
inquiries. He may, however, ask any official who will deign to
listen. Of six Bucn officials so interrogated, five will probably give
diverse and conflicting answers. The sixth will reply, "Can't say,
Sir, till the train comes in." By the time the train does come in, the
passenger will probably have been urgently directed to quite
another platform. Here he will be allowed to wait until the train is
on the point of starting, when he will be vociferously hurried
through long and intricate passages up flights of steep stairs, just in
time to miss it. This process may be repeated as long as the
strength and patience of the passenger hold out.
Q. Why is this?
A. In questions concerning railways, inquiry must be limited to the
"how" and the " what." The " why" is a region of impenetrable
darkness and mystery— so far at least as the public is concerned.
Q. But are not standing notices, numerical and otherwise, pro-
vided for the public information?
A. Sometimes. But these notices know no settled rule or fixed
abiding place, save that the aim of their providers seems to be to
make them as small in size, as unapparent in position, and as puz-
zling in purport as is possible. No man knows with certainty where
to seek them, and by no means every man can understand or even
decipher them when ne finds them.
Q. How so?
A. They are commonly written in minute characters, or placed in
obscure and out-of-the-way corners, perched so high that only long-
visioned persons can read them, or so dirty, defaced, or obscured
with confused chalk marks that they can be read by no one at all. _ A
short-sighted person seeking a small notice board amidst a confusion
of obtrusive huge-lettered advertisements is one of the most painfully
convincing proofs of the dull and donkey-like endurance of the public,
and of the dogged and mulish stupidity of officialism. The adver-
tiser, who is seeking patronage, forces his Titanic posters on the
public ken. The Railway Company, which is only providing the
public with what it has paid for in advance, makes its moBt essential
announcements obscure and difficult of discovery.
Q. Cannot inquiries, on minor points at least, such as the time of
arrival of a certain train, the Stations it will stop at, &c, be ad-
dressed to some of the tribe of Station-Masters, Porters, &c, who
flock on Railway platforms?
A. They can. But the process is beset with difficulties, and the
results are at best problematical.
Q. How is that?
A. There are many reasons. At minor Stations it is the habit of
these various officials to disappear absolutely during all intervals.
Immediately before the arrival of a train they rush in from all
quarters, like skirmishers, over the lines, up traps, down ladders,
and out of hidden doorways; but they are then far too much occu-
pied, in dashing about, and howling, to furnish any intelligible
information whatever to the anxious inquirer.
Q. And at larger Stations?
A. The attendants at these are men of many occupations, of
uncertain temper, and much given to mental absorption, and to rapt
observation of distant events. Such a person, engaged in picking
walnuts, in imparting a joke or a racing " tip," in emptying a pewter-
pot behind a door, in chatting with a much -be-ribboned regular,"
in swearing at large, in watching a pigeon's flight, or meditating in
a corner on the minor morals, can hardly be looked to for civil
answers to reasonable inquiries. If he should condescend to notice
your interrogation, his answer is apt to assume one or other of three
somewhat unsatisfactory forms:—1. Curt avowal of ignorance,
couched in the Porter's pet shibboleth, "Dunno," or " Carn't say."
2. Careful mwdirection. 3. Absolute unintelligibleness.
Q. It would seem, then, that there is every probability of the
passenger being detained on the Platform for some time. What pro-
vision is made for his accommodation in these circumstances?
A. The ordinary Railway Platform is the most exposed, draughty,
dirty, and generally uncomfortable place in which a civilised being
can dispose himself. At important Stations where there are
Refreshment and. Waiting-Rooms, the long-detained traveller may
be spared the worst pangs of hunger, thirst, and cold. But at minor
Stations, where even such partial luxuries are unthought of, he is
exposed to every variety of physical discomfort.
Q. For example?
A. Prolonged sitting on a hard and damp or dusty seat, in a
thorough draught, is not pleasant. Weary waiting in a bare, evil-
smelling, and tireless box is not much better. Tedious tramping up
and down a bleak Btretch of asphalte, exposed to the erratic on-
slaughts of luggage-trollies and milk-cans is, perhaps, worse. And
these are commonly the three alternatives of the traveller who is
doomed to wait on a Railway Platform.

Prize-Puzzle Pic-tube.—We have not, as yet, been requested to
award the Prize-Puzzle War-Picture to any one of our illustrated
weekly contemporaries; but, had we been so requested, we should
unhesitatingly have adjudicated it in favour of the Graphic's repre-
sentation of the " Advance of the Duke of Connaught's Brigade on
Tel-El-Kebir," in its latest number. The Guards have their backs
towards the spectator, and are clearly going forward; but the Duke
of Connaught—at least, we suppose it is the Duke—and an offioer, aro
urging their steeds at a tremendous pace towards the spectator that
is, just in the opposite direction to the Guards' advance. JNot being
military, perhaps we ought not to criticise this strategic movement
but to the ordinary eye of the simple Civilian, the effect suggested
by the picture is that if the Guards, going frmn us, are advancing on
Tel-El-Kebir, the two wild horsemen, coming towards us, are-well
-at all events, not advancing on \e-El-Kebir. Sure y the Art.st
didn't mean this, and the para-graphic rfferenoe-a qiiotetion from

"ROBERT" AT THE GUILDHALL.
Having a lezzur hour or 2 on my hands, I sorntered on Thursday
into the Court of Common Counsel at Gildhall to see my speshal
paytrons in their sollem and sober aspecs. And a grand site it is to
all the trew lovers of our nobel old civic City.
There was the Lord Mare in the same gorgeous state as I lately
seed him in at the Ague in Olland. with all the ensigns of olliee about
him, but supported by two new Snerryffs insted of the two old 'uns
as he had when he was all abroad, and by about a duzzen reel Alder-
men, tho' I should ha' liked to have seen 'em in their lovely scarlet
Robes trimmed all over with sabel brown fur, for without 'em they
don't look werry much diffrent from the mere common Councillors.
Well, presently a fine portly looking Gentelman who I was told
cum from pleasant Billigsgate got up and asked 'em all to give a
wote of thanks and a gold box and a sword a peace to Sir Cardinal
Wolset and Sir Bikchkm Seamore for their galliant services in
Egyp. Ah, he did make a speech he did I It was of no use for lots
of the common Counsel to keep a calling out, "Agreed, agreed!
Time, time I" On he went for about three quarters of a nour a
poundin away more like a old Roman horater, as I've herd my son
William read about, than a simple common Counseller.
Not the least attenshun did he pay to all the noisy lot, tho' the
noise was so great that I couldn't hear a single sentence of his most
butifnl and conwincing speech, till when he had got nearly to the
hend of his jolly long tether, he held up both his hands and shouted
out, "We must spare his life, we must save him I" "Who?
who P" shouted the C. Cs. "Who?" said the Gent from Billings-
gate. "Why, Harryby!" At this there was a louder roar than
ever of " Question, question," and at lenth he sat down. But some
time after the resulushun had been past, the Gent got up again and
proposed they should all stand up and give 3 Cheers for the troops
in Egyp, but his boilin over enthusiasm was nipt in the bud by the
Lord M auk a calling of him to Horder I
Then came by far the most important part of the hole matter and
in which I of course felt myself pussonally interested, namely, how
much money they was a going to wote for the customary Bankwet in
Gildhall.
The Gent who had had hall the talk to hisself had said about £500.
£5001 why what a beggarly sum for a General a Admiral and the
Officers and men of all ranks under their commands, and for all their
nobel selves besides 1
Why for about the fust time in my life I felt quite ashamed of
'em. But there was one Counsellor present, and a reel Gentelman
too, I shouVd say, who c wedently shared my feelins and guv notice
to make it up to two thousand the nex time as they meets. So
there's still a chance of their saving their character.
Take my word for it, Gentelmen Counsellors, common or uncom-
mon, that if there's one thing more than another as makes you re-
spected in your Corporashun by every body, from the Prinoe to the
Waiter, it's your liberality in money matters. Never mind the
grumblers, you never taxes em so they needn't grumble, never mind
the poor hungry barristers as wood only be too glad to heat the crums
from your tables, never mind the sour and crabbed Gents as call
theirselves States Men, and thinks theirselves oleyer coz they're
sawcastio, so long as you're truly libberal and gives away your
money as you do by Pailfuls for all the many hills as flesh is air to,
and gives grand bangkwets to such gardien angels as Generals and
Admerals and Kings and Princes you may feel quite satisfied that
your brilliant and savoury career won't be disturbed for many long
years to come.
But if you 're a going in for aconermy, which is only another word
for meanness, or for saving, which is only another word for stingy-
ness, then prepare to shut up shop, and believe with the worn out
old Timet that you've seen the election of the last Lord Mare of the
City of London, and tho' from what I have seen and herd of him,
he;'s likely to be about as good a Lord Mare as we ever had, there 's
one rayther good judge who don't bleeve he '11 be the last, and his
name is Robert.

GIVING THEM FAIR PLAY.
A LITTLE HOLIDAY.
After Lunch—Return—Choirt—Cure for Deafness— One Bumper
at Parting—Exeunt Juhnnie»—Back to Castle—Finish of Little
Holiday Time.
After luncheon The Johnnies positively refuse to return to the
Eisteddfod. Professor Edwards looks in to tell me that if I want to
hear a grand effect ,1 had better hurry up for the performance of
"The March of the Men of Harlech" by the competing Choirs. I
tell him that unfortunately having caught cold last night my deaf-
ness in one ear has increased, and I am sure I want both ears to pay
proper attention to the Eisteddfod Choirs.
Happy Thought [Shakspearian).—"Had I two ears I'd hear
thee.
The Professor hasn't time to waste in arguing; he disappears, and
finding The Johnnies indisposed to do anything but lounge and
smoke, I return with Wynevan to the Eisteddfod Building, which
we just reach in time to hear two admirable performances of " The
March" by two competing Choirs. This time we do not mount the
platform, where only the Choirs and their leaders are prominent; the
"Conductor " of the Eisteddfod—which sounds as if the Eisteddfod
were an omnibus—and the Eminent M.P. in the Chair having been
both temporarily shunted into opposite corners, as if they were mere
lay-figures which, having served their purpose, could be stowed away
anywhere.
'I wish I weren't so deaf," I say to Wynevan. But before the finish
of the sixteenth bar of the stentorian March, given by a couple of hun-
dred voices, more or less, with thunderingeffect, I am conscious of
something going crack inside my head—"Hope it'snot your brain,"
says Wynevan. "Nochance of that} my bonnie boy," says Johnnie
Prosser,—and I wish I could give him a repartee, a real stinger, but
I can't at the moment—(a really good and new repartee being as diffi-
cult to produce just exactly at the right moment as is an appropriate
simile—though by to-morrow I shall have one ready, and then, next
time it's said to me, let that person look out)—and in a fraction
of a second, and by the fraction of something else—(" Your ten-
penny," says Johnnie, thinking this a facetious way of saying
tympanum),—my deafness has utterly disappeared, and the " Men
of Harlech " take me by storm. This is the one thing worth hearing
—if there were any others, they were performed during my absence.
I confess to considerable disappointment. The Eisteddfod is not
what it ought to be, and nothing to what it might be, if properly
managed. Wynevan tells me that a Chief Committee is taking it
in hand, and that all the Eisteddfod gatherings will, he hopes, be
amalgamated in one great National Demonstration, to be held
triennially; that the old ceremonies will be revived, every encourage-
ment given to native talent, the London-concert element to be
omitted, and such a locality chosen for so grand a meeting as shall
offer opportunities for open-air performance, weather permitting,
and for under-cover performance,' weather not permitting.
The Ladies have already left for Glwanffai Castle. Coming down
the town we meet Huohie Grillston with "J. II." and Freddie
Mickhax in a dog-cart; "J. B." driving. They pull up with a
"Whoop!" and a view-holloa that brings several people out of their
houses, and then, speaking together, the three thank Wynevan for
his hospitality of the previous evening, and regret they can't return
to the Castle, as they are all engaged to dine with one another—it is
not at all clear who is giving the dinner, or where in the neigh-
bourhood they are engaged to dine—and are going out " grousing"
next morning. Johnnie, after being roundly abused by them
for not joining them, which sounds odd with our host close at hand,
bids them a temporary farewell, and there is a last dash at a bear-
fight in the high road, arising out of an attempt on Freddie's
part to stoop down from the dog-cart and take on Johnnie's hat,
who thereupon retaliates by trying to drag Freddie off his Beat,
when the horse, unaccustomed to these performances, makes a
sudden start, which nearly jerks Hdohie off the back seat into the
road, in the middle of which in another second Johnnie is left sitting
without a hat, and his coat and waistcoat half off his shoulders. He
has come rather heavily down. [Happy Thought.—" One Bumper
at parting."] Hughie—who saved himself from falling by a side
rail and a strap at the back of the box-seat—has within t he next
half-minute sufficiently recovered his equilibrium to be able to
sound a blast of triumph on a coaoh-horn, as the dog-cart turns a
corner, and the three '' Johnnies,'' halloaing, whooping, and shouting,
are lost to our eyes, and gradually to our ears.
"That's the worst of Freddie, says Johnnie, as he picks his hat
out of the mud, "he's never happy unless he's bear-fighting. But
1 very nearly landed him out of that cart." This reflection seems to
afford some comfort to him, and the prospect of meeting " the other
Johnnies" again not being very remote, he somewhat recovers his
spirits, which appeared to have been a little damped at parting with
his companions; and, left to himself and to us, he beoomes a per-
feotly rational being, whom it would be impossible to associate with
practical joking, bear-fighting, and " Johnnies" generally.
• *••••
The Little Holiday is over for the present. I shall move on some-
where else—to several somewhere-elses—and try, in perfect quiet, to
bring to maturity my new Simile Book, which I feel is so much
wanted as to be quite a desideratum of the present age.

OPERA OF THE FUTURE.
"Midas " writes as follows:—
"' Rot your Italianos!' cried the
wife of the Old English Alder-
man. 'I likes a simple hallat.'
Sir Geobge Bowtee, in a recently
published epistle on ' The Future
of the Italian Opera,' maintains,
with muoh force, an argument to
the reverse of that lady's malison.
But what does the language of
any libretto greatly matter to the
hearer of any Opera? Unless he
has got it to read, can he ever
make out more than a word or
two of words not articulated but
sung, so that for the most part he
only hears vowels and diphthongs
reiterated, rested on, trilled,
fugued—a suooession of unintel-
ligible sounds spun into 'linked
sweetness long drawn out.' Even
for the most serious opera, rather
perhaps indeed than for opera-
bouffe, would not mere vocables
such as ' do, re, mi, fa,' or ' one,
two, three,' or, for that matter,
'tol de rol lol,' See,, set with
sufficient solemnity or pathos, if
only accompanied by suitable
pantomime, do just as well as
words of whioh the BenBe is in-
distinguishable, even when they
have any?" Nay, "Midas!"
Don't be a donkey.
The G. 0. M., at Penmaenmawr,
informed the Taffies that he had
"carried on war on the principles
of peace." This is a sort of adap-
tation of Cardinal Newman's
remark on Dr. Pusey's Eirenikon,
which he termed an olive-branch
discharged from a catapult. Mr.
John Bright and Hobrtble
Pasha must be pretty much of the
same opinion.

DELICACIES AT THE

In the Dairy-Show at the Agri-

attracted by samples of "British

French and Italian neighbours.
Imitation is the sincerest flattery.
By way of return, perhaps
French and Italian Dairymen
will send us over "Neapolitan
Cheshire,"for example, or " Vosges
Cheddar," or " Cote d'Or Cheshire,"
and " Loire Stilton."
The "SageCheeses," also, were
very much applauded. It would
be a pleasing improvement of
Sage Cheeses if they were moulded
in the classical figures of anoient
philosophers. These caseous
images might then accordingly
be named one Sage Cheese
"Socrates," another, "Plato," a
third, "Aristotle," a fourth,
"Seneca," and so on with other
antique Sages. Modern Sages
also oould have been represented
by Sage Cheeses, as a " Hobbes"
Cheese, a "Locke" Cheese, a
"Newton " Cheese; nor would it,
perhaps, be too much of a solecism
to call a Sage Cheese " Bacon."

CRITICISM FOR THE MILLION.
A College for the Higher Education of Lower Class Left-Off'uns
was opened, yesterday, at Ennyton. Lord D-bby presided, and the
Inaugural Address was delivered bv Mr. M-tth-w A-n-ld.
Mr. M-tth-w A-n-ld, who. on rising, was much cheered by the
little Left OfTuns, remarked that, perhapB, some of his audience had
never even heard of his existence. (" No, no ! ") ltao, he begged
them to believe that it was certainly not his own fault. (Cheers.)
He had been described as a literary quack, with a few cant phrases
as his nostrums, and as a master of the art of polished slang. He
need hardly Bay that persons who thought so were deplorable
Philistines. {Cheers.) Others said that he was a kind of mixture
of Erasmus and Addison, with a flavour of M. Renan, and a dash
of Dr. Busby added. Passing, however, from personal matters,
whioh he always found some difficulty in doing, he had now to con-
sider what was the exact critical lollipop which might be most
likely to tickle the palates of his little audience. All Englishmen
ought to be more lucid. All middle-class people ought to go to
Publio Schools. Publio Schools had sometimes been regarded as
homes of Muscular Christianity. He (Mr. A-n-ld) preferred to con-
sider them as haunts of Sweetness and Light. (Loud cheers.) Ihe
great need of our nation was Intellectual Urbanity. If he were
asked, which he had not been, to state what the chief nations of
Europe were conspicuously defioient in, he would say, with that
amount of confidence which the invention of a few brilliant catch-
words always inspired in him, that the French lacked Moral Con-
tinuity, the Germans Political Perspicuity, the Russians ' geist,
and the. English Intellectual Urbanity. (Cheers.) Take, tor
instance, the habit of kicking refraotory wives to death; who could
doubt that a spread of Intellectual Urbanity would tend to a decrease
in this national custom? Ritualism was due to lack of mental equi
poise; so was Roman-Catholioism; so was Agnosticism; so was
Dissent; so, in fact, was everything. The Upper Classes, whom he
always liked to call Barbarians, and the Middle Class, whom, for his
part, he could never designate except as Philistines, were shockingly
lacking in this quality. As for the Lower Classes, for whom he had
not yet discovered any satisfactory niok-name, they were deplorably
destitute of Urbanity. He should be quite content if upon his tomb-
stone, in Westminster Abbey, were inscribed the single sentence,—
"He was distinguished for Intellectual Urbanity." (Loud cheers.)
Lord D-by remarked that there was, no doubt, a good deal in what
had just been said. Parts of that address were striking, not to say
peculiar. Mr. M-tth-w A-n-ld was one of the most remarkable
Critics of our time. Intellectual Urbanity, no doubt, was an excel-
lent quality, and he should think about cultivating it himself; but
he confessed he could not see how the navvy, who worked twelve
hours a day for six days out of seven, and oame home dead tired at
night, oould find much time for this sort of thing. It must also be
remembered that stagnation was not the highest form of existence;
that aotivity and energy were quite as valuable as urbanity; and that
this way of knocking off every olass in the country as defioient in
some brand-new patent virtue, was the sort of "Lucidity whioh
was found in its highest state of development in our Idiot Asylums.
Some people, also, had chosen to assert that the Apostles of sweet-
ness and Light would reduce everything to Sourness and Blight.
Otherwise, he quite agreed with the eminent Lecturer. (Cheers.)
The Meeting then terminated in some oonfusion.
At the Royal Opera House, Berlin, on last Thursday night, the
fire-proof curtain fell with a orash. This is something like bringing
down the curtain with startling effect. Only, after this, about one
month will have to elapse before the next Aot can possibly begin.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEL
TO THE ANTI-CYCLONE.
"An anti-cyclone is forming over these islands, which renders
fine weather almost certain, bnt mist and fog will become
increasing probably."—Daily Telegraph.
An Anti-Cyclone, promising fine weather,
Is passing o'er these islands—well and good;
But there's a proverb that we learnt together,
"Don't halloo till yon 're well out of the wood."
This horrid anti-oyelone will insist
On bringing with it also fog and mist.
Fine weather I Meteorologists are mocking
Our hopes by talking of such days as fine!
Fog comes, the state of things is really shocking;
You 're weather-bound, you daren't go out and dine;
And though all vehicles crawl slow as crabs,
Lo! carriages are charging into cabs.
Fine weather! when a blackness as of night
Comes o'er the City from the East and West;
We breakfast by a bilious gaslight,
The while depression weighs on every breast;
And looking sadly at the fog and smoke,
We wonder when we shall begin to choke.
So, Meteorologists, don't raise the curtain
That shrouds the future; or, if yon insist,
Why tell us that fine weather's almost certain,
And then go on to promise days of mist?
Fine weather, truly, when our throats you clog
With all impurities of London Fog!
FLOATING CAPITAL.
It is satisfactory to find that even the Egyptian War
has not quite obliterated the " great gooseberry" season.
The Globe informs us that—
"A fUherman named Goiviv Strong has just caught in the
sea, about a mile from Watchet, a large conger eel, about 20 lbs.
in weight. The fisherman found in the throat a purse containing
half a sovereign."
We are glad to find that the Eel was caught in the
sea, though perhaps it would have been more wonderful
had it been caught on a turnpike-road. Is there not some
mistake about the weight P Should it not be twenty
pounds ten shillings? We understand purses are no
longer called porte-monnaies at Watchet, but " Congers."
"Go Win " was certainly not a bad name for this suc-
cessful coin-catcher.

crams building and grounds.
Omnes. The working class.

amongst these people to come in tribes, to come early, to depart late.
And you must know that they invariably bring baskets of provisions
with them, being unable to afford the prioes charged at the buffets,
and, moreover, preferring to pic-nio quietly amongst themselves.
Omnes. Of course we know all this.
& G. Well, then, let us place a notice over the entrance that no
one shall be permitted to bring refreshments into the Palace without
permission from the Board. [Cheers. Board breaks up—as it ought to.

(Supplementary Facts—omitted from the Times List.)
That everything is so much better on the Continent.
That the proverbially polite Frenchman never smokes before
Ladies in a railway carriage.
That not for worlds would he shut the window in your face and
glare at you if you ask for a little air.
That no official ever seen through a pigeon-hole at a post bureau
is dyspeptic and insolent.
That sanitary improvements in Italy do not mean typhoid fever.'J
That where your bed-room walls are of paper, and somebody on one
side of you retires in good spirits at two, and somebody else on the
other gets up lively at four, you have a refreshing night's rest.
That rambling parties of Cook's tourists add immensely to the
National prestige.
That the discovery of what it is you eat in a vol-au-vent at a "diner
a trois francs," will please but not surprise you.
That it is such fun being caged-up in a railway waiting-room,
and then being allowed to scamper for your life to the carriages.
That perpetual fighting to get into over-crowded hotels, crammed
with vulgar specimens of your own fellow- countrymen, is really
enjoyable and exhilarating work.
That a couple of journeys across the Channel, especially if it is
blowing both ways, are at least always something pleasant to look
back upon.
That when you once get home again, England, spite some trivial
advantages, being without Belgian Postmen, French omnibuses, and
Swiss Police-regulations, strikes you as almost unendurable.
From Sir E. Henderson's latest Police Keport it appears that
House-building and House-breaking are both on the increase.

THE HALL PORTER.
A pleasant, a calm, and inscrutable face,
Our Hall Porter shows in his cosy glass case;
He never is flurried, he's always exact,
His temper is good and he's plenty of tact;
He's master of Bradshaw, he always has change,
His knowledge of cab-fares hath infinite range!
Eaoh Cabby will find himself bound to defer
To the rare common sense of our Hall Por-ter
A dun at a glance he '11 detect, and a bore.
They '11 find him polite, but they '11 find nothing more!
He knows all your friends, and you 're never annoyed
By people you 're anxious to cut or avoid:
A careless observer would never suppose
The wonderful things that the Hall Porter knows!
He's 'cute as a Cabinet Min-i-«<er,
So cautious and cool is our Hall Por-fer.'
He '11 send out and get you good stalls for the play,
Your letters he '11 forward when you are away;
The smallest commission he '11 never forget,
He '11 whistle up oabs when it's terribly wet:
He 's thoughtful and thorough, and anxious to please,
And might write a novel from all that he sees!
The whole of the members will doubtless concur
In the heartiest praise of our Hall Por-ter'
A CROWE PITCH.

Study of Crowe-Bars.
Me. A. Gwyllym Crowe seems to have made a good pitoh—
concert-pitch, of course—this season at Covent Garden. One evening
last week, when there was no
particular attraction, we found
the house crammed full with a
most attentive and highly ap-
preciative audience that didn't
promenade until the Concertists
were well into the second part
of the programme. There was
a judicious selection from Schu-
mann, well and clearly rendered
on the piano by a young lady
whom Mr. Cbowe might intro-
duce as "My Waud," — the
name of the fair pianiste (whose
costume of Jsky blue with silver
trimmings was, it occurred to us, a trifle too suggestive of a heroine
at Astley's in the palmy days of the Equestrian Drama) being Miss
Florence Waud.
Miss Rosa Leo appears here to far greater advantage than she
did in some Strand opera-bouffe, and we question whether, in spite
of Weber, Wagner, and Schumann, Master Donizetti's 11
Segreto " wasn't, after all, the popular song of the evening; while,
undoubtedly, "Ah die la Morte," played on the cornet by Mr,
Howard Reynolds, was the success of the orchestral selections.
Hurrah for Donizetti and Verdi, and long life to Italian Opera 1
Mr. Howard Reynolds knows so well how to play his own cornet
that he hardly requires our assistance in blowing his trumpet. We
only heard him do this solo, but should much like to listen to his
performance of a theme and variations, which he might style
"Reynolds' Miscellany."
A gavotte by Lulli, was very well played, but what a melan-
choly set of people must have danced to it! or, if they com-
menced gaily, what a damper this gavotte must have been to them!
they must all have burst into tears, and left the room before
they reached the last figure. As the Jenny Joneses of the Princi-
pality would say to Mr. Gwyllym, "Gafotte inteet!"—it's more
of a Lulli-by.
The evening was enlivened by a sensational incident. After the
performance of the Lohengrin " Untr'acte," there was a pause, and
we were all anxiously expecting a certain Miss Ella Lemmens—
who, however, in this instance proved herself to be an un-certain
Miss Sella Genelums—to walk up and sing Carmen's Seguedilla
song, that charming air hummed by the Bizet Bee. But no Lem-
mens, no oranges—nothing! Evidently fruitless. Man, in rather
dustv livery, stepped up and whispered to Mr. Crowe, who whis-
pered to him in return. Man in dusty livery ducks his head,
bolts in among the violins, and disappears. Pause. Audience
impatient. Return of dusty-livery man. More whispers. Evidently
something wrong somewhere. "The vocalist oan't come," whispers,
probably, the livery dusty man. "Well—will you sing something
instead!" whispers Mr. Crowe to the Liveryman. "See you blowed
first," whispers the Liveryman, and bolts. Nothing for it, except
that Mr. Crowe has to announce to the audience that Miss Ella
Lemmens appears to be content with having her name in the pro-
gramme, and considers personal attendance as a mere unimportant
detail. Then, before the audience has time to express an opinion,
Mr. Crowe wheels round, lifts his bSton, cries " Up, Guards, and at
'em 1" and the band of the Coldstream Guards, which has combined
itself with the orchestra to produce a big effect, comes out fortissimo
with Preciosa.
Odd that the only bitter in the evening's entertainment arose from
the absence of Lemmens. As Mr. Crowe observed, "Where the
juice could the Lemmens be?" We hope no serious aooident pre-
vented her arrival; that no tumble-down cabman caused the break-
down of Carmen: and trust that when she does sing there will be a
orowd—quite a Lemmens-squash audience—to receive her in that
appropriate Spanish market-place at the baok of the Crowe Nest
Orchestra, due to the ingenuity of Mr. Bruce Smith, where all the
Toreadors, the Sefloras, the Sefiors, the Grandees, Hidalgos, and
Littlegos do mostly congregate, ready to listen to the notes of
Carmen^ and the orchestral music on a Gwyllym Crowe-matio scale
of magnificence.

C is the Caliph, who's not in the fun;
D denotes Dctfferin—giving him "one;"

AN EARLY CLOSING CLOTURE.
In answer to an invitation to stand for Finsbury in the Liberal
interest on the next opportunity, Dr. B. W. Richardson, L.L.I).,
F.R.S., has told the Executive Committee of the Finsbury Liberal
Association, "that he shall be happy to meet them for the purpose
of explaining his views as soon as his engagements will allow." Dr.
Richardson s reply might have been expeoted to be that he was very
sensible of the compliment paid him by the Finsbury Liberals, and
thanked them for their offer of a seat in Parliament as much as if he
could accept it; but lamented that he couldn't. Not but that Dr.
Richardson may well be supposed quite capable of sacrificing his
personal inclinations and professional interests to the public good;
but it seems rather too muoh to expect him not only to sacrifice his
health also, but, as a Sanitary as well as a Political Reformer, to set
a bad example in so doing, by usually sitting up all night until two,
three, or four, and still further on in the morning, during half the
year, as he will have to do, if he consents to represent Finsbury.
It is, however, conceivable that Dr. Richardson may be willing to
undertake the task and the trouble of attending in the House of
Commons, and sitting out nights of verbiage, for the express purpose
of bringing his scientific authority and influence to bear on the
Leaders of the House, and all the rest of the honourable and right
honourable gentlemen, known by their much speaking, so as to induce
them, if possible, to cut it short, and thereby enable the Legislature,
every evening, to shut up at a reasonable hour. If so, then hooray
for Dr. Richardson, L.L.D., F.R.S! Dr. Richardson for Finsbury!
Richardson for ever! Success to Dr. Richardson in his struggle
to induoe the House of Commons to adopt a scientific and hygienio
cloture. Finsbury will indeed have reason to be proud and happy, if
the views above expressed shall prove to be those which Dr. Richard-
son is going to explain as soon as his engagements will allow him.
We pause for his explanation.

AN INTERCEPTED LETTER.
Mr dear Boys, S-ndr-ngh-m, October, 1882.
I was most pleased to find your joint epistle waiting me on
my breakfast-table this morning, and equally gratified to gather
from the unusual facility with which I deciphered its interesting
contents, that you had already made considerable progress in your
latest curriculum of studies. Your excellent Tutor has evidently
lost no time in correcting the nautical peculiarities of your illegible,
but otherwise agreeable, handwriting, and I desire you to convey to
him my sincere thanks for the kind manner in which he has already
attended to my wishes in this regard. And while on the subject of
your excellent Tutor, I wish, my dear Boys, particularly to impress
on you the importance of keeping constantly in your mind the fact,
that the most admirably conceived and effective practical joke proper
to the gun-room, could scarcely, with any sense of propriety, be
fittingly entertained in the study. And I must enjoin on you to
reflect that the innocent and amusing ceremonial in which you may
possibly have assisted King Neptune to welcome a messmate making
his first acquaintance with the Equator, could under no circum-
stances be essayed in the case of a minister in holy orders, who had
not even the recommendation of being at sea, but happened to be
pursuing a quiet but important vocation on the shores of a classio
lake. _ You have, my dear Boys, on more than one occasion crossed
the Line. I trust that after my expressed injunctions on this subject
you will let me learn that you also know where to draw it.
I am interested to hear that you are beginning to speak French
with a Swiss accent whioh is as pure as the Swiss milk. I am also
extremely gratified to know that you find the place a little more
secluded than you expeoted. Believe me, there is no surer incentive
to assiduous study than the absence of recreative distraction. If the
length of this letter would permit, I could, by recounting to you the
sombre experiences of my own Oxford and Cambridge days, reconcile
you to the comparatively dull and colourless retirement to which you
are at present consigned, and which you will some day acknowledge
to have been so eminently beneficial.
But time presses. I am most happy to be informed that you have
taken several long country walks. Try to cultivate a simple taste
of this kind, for, believe me, in after-life you will find it almost
invaluable. I will add, in conclusion, that while I am naturally
anxious that your application should receive no unnecessary and
demoralising check, at the same time I am not averse to your occa-
sional indulgence in any innocent amusement. Should, therefore, a
travelling Circus give a performance in the immediate neighbour-
hood, as you seem to anticipate, you have my full permission to
attend one morning performance, subject, of course, to the pro-
gramme meeting with the sanction and approval of your excellent
Tutor, to whom I desire you to present my best compliments.
And now, my dear and merry Swiss Boys, as it is nearly half-past
nine (my usual hour for retiring to rest), 1 must close this, and
subscribe myself always Your affectionate Father, A. E.
THE PETS OP THE PLEISTOCENE.
[Fossil fauna have been found in excavating the foundations of Drum-
mond's Bank, and Mr. Rowland Ward writes to the Times that "indi-
genous lions once roared where the electrio light now shines at Charing Cross."]
How strange are the wild zoological dreams
That come from exploring old gravels and seams:
The animals must have been truly sublime
That were seen on the earth in the Pleistocene time;
And the Lion, we learn, was in those days " top boss"
Of the forests that flourished around Charing Cross.
Could they come back again, how the people would stare
To see Elephants walk in Trafalgar's wide square;
There the Irish and Red Deer would muster each morn,
And the mighty Rhinoceros raise up his horn;
While the Bos primigenius would oome down the Strand,
Arm-in-arm with the Mammoth, to dine at " The Grand."
They 'd stare at the statues, and wonder what great
Men had done to deserve so appalling a fate;
They'd see how the smoke-cloud, spread out like a pall
Over London, in darkness envelopes us all;
While the Thames of their time ran quite clear to the sea,
Lo! the Thames of to-day is as black as can be.
They would note crawling cabs, and see folks make a fuss
To get into that hearse on four wheels called a 'bus;
They would find when the snow came all vehicles stop,
And that traders in town might as well shut up shop;
They would Bee how the Rough was the lord of the street,
And the Peeler, when wanted, was not on his beat.
So the Mammoth would think, and the Lion would vow,
That the days when they flourished were better than now:
And that Man prehistono was festive and fat,
Though his Bhin-bones they say were uncommonly flat:
Then the earth was far freer from troubles and crimes.
Oh, why can't we go back to Pleistocene times P
Breakfast for Two.—Mr. J. T. Bedford, at the Court of Com-
mon Council, expressed his opinion that £500 was a very shabby
amount for the City to fork out for a dtjeiiner a la fourchette to be
given to Sir Beauchamp Seymour and Sir Gabnet. Quite right,
Mr. J. T. B., and when we and two or three of our young men want
something good in the way of a dejeuner, we know the host we shall
choose. Breakfast for two eminent persons at £250 a head! Pshaw I
Not worth; mentioning.

ME. GREENHORN'S EXPERIENCES.
THE LIBERAL HABERDASHER.
I have just received a Ciroular from Messrs. Isaacs and Lawson,
Haberdashers, that has filled me with profound regret.
It is addressed to Mrs. Greenhorn, but as, fortunately or un-
fortunately as the oase may be, there is no Mrs. Greenhorn, I took
the liberty of opening it, and what do I find? A kindly intimation
to a supposed Mrs. Greenhorn that, in consequence of the terrible
and unprecedented depression in the Silk Markets, Messrs. Isaacs
and Lawson have been enabled to purchase an enormous quantity of
the most costly Silks and Satins at such ridiculously low prices, that
some of them are for sale at little more than a quarter of what they
cost to manufacture!
That of itself is terrible enough to think of, for of course under
such circumstances, there must be an end of all silk manufacturing
for years to oome, and consequent fearful distress among the poor
operatives. But there is always a silver lining to a cloud, however
black it may appear to us, and so it is in the present sad case.
Having made this enormous purchase at such absurdly low prices,
what steps do these patriotio Gentlemen next take? Do they
endeavour to make enormous profits out of the misfortunes of their
fellow-oountrymen at Maoclesfield, Manchester, and Spitalfields, or
of their silky friends at Paris and Lyons? No, certainly not, but
with a degree of magnanimity seldom equalled, never excelled, they
desire to make even an imaginary Mrs. Greenhorn a partaker of
their good fortune, and they actually offer her, in one tempting lot,
"7,650 yards of good 22 inoh silks, for evening wear, all in perfect
condition, at 1«. 1\d. per yard, the usual price being 3s. 9d.!"
If that is considered too large a quantity for one lady, presumably
of moderate dimensions, they offer her "2,152 yards of large cheok
all silk Grenadines, at Is. \0\d. per yard, original price 4s. 9d. 1"
Again, supposing she requires but a very moderate quantity of
these costly productions, she may possess herself of any quantity of
Ombre Silk and Tinsel Balzarine, 20 inches wide, at 9Jrf. per yard,
which actually cost 2s. lOJrf. to manufacture! Perhaps, when I add
that Black Satins, in perfect condition, are to be had at Is. lOJrf. per
yard, and other Black Satins, slightly damaged, at 2|rf. per yard, I
have reached a lower depth in commercial depression than was ever
known since the days of Eve, who, presumably, would not have been
tempted even by such bargains as these.
I don't know much about such ^mysterious matters as Ladies'
dresses myself, but I was speaking at the Club yesterday to Tom
Robinson, who knows all about everything, and he quite agrees
with me that no Lady could possibly want such enormous quantities
of silks, however cheap they might be, though, as Tom says, they do
dearly love a bargain.
Of course, too. they must want largely increased quantities for
what they call their trains, Tom calls them their dusters, and they
certainly do keep the floors in capital condition.
However, be tnat as it may, as I have one or two female relatives
in the country to whom I should like to show a little attention,
especially a somewhat precise maiden Aunt from whom I have some
considerable expectations, I have written to Messrs Isaacs and
Lawson, requesting them to forward a sufficient quantity of the
"good 22 inch Silk, for evening wear, at Is. 7|rf.." to the Aunt in
question, and to my other two female Relatives, sufficient of the "all
Silk Grenadines at Is. Of rf.," to make them handsome dresses. In each
case I have also ordered a small quantity of the slightly damaged
Black Satin at 2}rf. for trimming, and I make no doubt my unwonted
liberality will cause them as much surprise as gratification.
It is not often in these days of heartless competition, that we find
Tradesmen coming forward with a spirit of liberality worthy of
any age or of any race to ask the Public to share thus largely in
their good fortune, and, not content with that, they advise their
friends to come early.
Tom says laughingly that their reason for so advising is, that it is
usually the early worm that is caught by the bird, and that they
open their doors at the unearthly hour of nine for the purpose of
taking in the early comers, such as the imaginary Mrs. Greenhorn;
but, as usual, I don't quite see the joke. Josspn Greenhorn.

The Overlaud Route was written by Tom Tatloe for a certain
set of popular Actors associated with the Haymarket Theatre. It
was a capital piece of work at the time, each Actor being correctly
measured, and perfectly fitted by our Sartor Dramaticus. It was
such pleasant and easy work to write for
Buckstone, Compton, and Charles

fitted, the rest was mere detail, and
mattered very little. What were the

and as long as these comedians amused
them, the plot of the piece, its Author,
its title, and even the names of the
characters represented by their favourites,
were matters of very little importance.
But nowadays everybody is a Critic:
the bill is carefully scrutinised to see who
plays what, and we absolutely dare to
expect that Actors shall sink their per-
sonal identity in the part eaoh one may
have to represent. We are not satisfied
to see Mr. Bancroft as Tom Dexter, but
he must so impress us with the faot
that his Tom Dexter is the only possible
person of that name, that we must be
positively unable to imagine any other. The audience that, years
ago, saw Charles Mathews as Tom Dexter, would have been
utterly disappointed had that rattling light Comedian ceased to be
himself, and become the character he impersonated. No matter
what the name of the character, as long as it was a " touch-and-go"
part—anything with a "patter" dialogue—Charles Mathews, in
spite of all disguise, remained Charles Mathews to the end.
This, of course, only applies to him in this Bort of impersonation, as
his Sir Charles Coldstream, his Affable Hatch, and his Lavater were
distinctly marked characters. But Tom Dexter in the Overland Route
was simply another name for Charles Mathews in that play, and if he
be made, what Mr. Bancroft can scarcely helpmaking him, an earnest,
energetic, muscular Christian, but shallow philosopher, who tries to
conceal his melancholy temperament by the assumption of a boisterous
geniality, then the mainspring of the work is injured, and the mecha-
nism halts. It is not that Mr. Bancroft is not the Author's Tom Dex-
ter, but it is that the Author's Tom Dexter was Charles Mathews—
no one else. To institute a comparison would be unfair; there can be
none. Mr. Bancroft himself, in his most hilarious moments, would
never have commissioned an Author to write such a part as this for
him. He thought he could give a new reading of the character
which should be equally true to the Author's intention, and
equally as effective as Charles Mathews' rendering of it. He has
given a new reading, but the character won't stand it. It might
nave fitted Mr. Charles Wyndham, who would, perhaps, have over-
bustled it; but do with it what he will, act it as carefully and as
well as he possibly can, Mr. Bancroft remains Mr. Bancroft to the
end, as Mr. Charles Mathews remained himseB:, only that the
character was
written for the
latter, and not
for the former.
Mr. Charles
Mathews could
not have played
Captain Hawtree
in Caste, and in
this Mr. Bait-
croft was inimi-
table.
Mr. David
James is very
funny as Lovi-
bond, but the
notion will haunt
us that he is
doing his utmost
to avoid being
like Bcckstone,
and that the
dialogue—specially the strong expressions and the broad side-
Bplitters in which the old Haymarket favourite, as a chartered
libertine, revelled—is perpetually entrapping him into a momentary
imitation of the original exponent of this utterly farcical character.
Mrs. John Wood is excellent, and her scenes with Mr. D. James
are capital faree ; but the dialogue, which has been written into (and

"Mrs. B." bright as Mrs. Se-bright, between the Elders.
which since the first night may have been expunged) the Third Aot,
is weak compared with all the good things they have to say belong-
ing properly to the pieoe.
Mrs. Bancroft, from beginning to end, is excellent, only once
overdoing a scene with Mrs. John Wood until, brief though it is, it
began to remind us of the quarrel in
Madame Angot rather than a fenc-
ing-match between a couple of
Ladies,—though, by the way, in
what society these Ladies move
(what was Mr, Lovibond profession-
ally P) is not quite clear; so that,
after all, a considerable latitude may
be allowed both ladies—and they do
allow it to themselves, and make the
most of it.
Mr. Alfred Bishop, as the old
made-up fop, with false teeth and
dyed whiskers, gives a carefully
considered bit of character; so also
does Mr. Brookfield, who certainly
completely loses his own identity in
his impersonation of the old Indian
oAioer—a fact that will forcibly Btrike
anyone who sees him first of all in
his drawing-room monologue which
precedes the comedy, — a plucky
attempt, by the way, on which we congratulate him, and, in the
words of Mr. Sam Weller, after his joke to Mr. Blazes at the Bath
footmen's swarry, we hope that he '11 " try a better next time."
Mr. Smedlet's card-sharping cowardly Captain was about as good
as it could be; and Mr. Everill's 3Iajor McTurk wasn't.
The piece is marvellously well put on the stage. Those P. and
O. steamers must be magnificent, judging from this specimen, and
the height of the cabins must be equal to that of a Belgrave-Square
drawing-room. The Deck Scene is admirably contrived: the stage-

management admirable, and the way in which the finish of the
Second Act of this very light comedy is suddenly intensified into a
thrilling melodramatic climax, is strictly true to the life.
The piece, if never interesting, is at all events very amusing, and

time to come.

or Rip Van Snodgrats, was preceded by a banquet given to the French
Composer, Librettists, and foreign Journalists, by the Manager of the
Theatre, whereat one of our principal English Musical Critics drank
to the success of M. Planquette's new Opera. We are not aware
whether this entertainment, so thoughtfully provided by the Manager
of the Comedy Theatre, was largely attended by our Musical and
Dramatic Critics; but if .Rip Van Winkle, seen through champagne
glasses, was not, in the eyes of the Critics, at all events, a big success,
it will not have been the fault of the Manager, who so judiciously
applied Dr. Mowbrat Morris's "Chicken-and-Champagne" pre-

HISTORY RE-VIEWED.
By Whytc Washclur.
No. II.—Oliver Cromwell, the Monarchy's Defender.
The subject of this sketch was born at Huntingdon, in 1599, and
from his earliest years was distinguished for his devoted fidelity to
Charles the First, of whom he was one of the most intimate
friends and staunch supporters.
In 162G, Cromwell, who had failed at St. Ives as a farmer, came
up to London and entered Parliament. Here he was very muoh
worried by the vagaries of his royal master, who was constantly
playing idiotic tricks upon him. Charles and Oliver were very
unlike, but, by the aid of a clever theatrical perruquier, the former
could " make-up " so exactly like the latter, that their closest inti-
mates could not tell the difference between them. Taking advantage
of this power of disguising himself, Charles (who was passionately
fond of practical joking) used frequently to enter the House of
Commons in the costume of Cromwell. But this was not all. The
King, once in his friend'B seat, used immediately to rise and give
vent to the most democratic opinions—sentiments utterly opposed
to Cromwell's feelings. After one of these freaks, Charles would
implore Oliver "not to spoil the fun" by revealing the fraud to his
colleagues. Thus bound over to secresy, the poor fellow had to carry
on the deception, and gained in time, in consequence, a reputation
as a Puritan and a Republican. But his clothes, as well as his repu-
tation, suffered by these proceedings. Charles was very careless
of Oliver's doublet and hose, and often took them off in rags and
tatters. Thus, Oliver was known not only as a traitor, but a
sloven. He was so persecuted by the Madcap Charles that at
last he determined to set sail for America. The King, however,
hearing of his butt's intended departure, immediately prevented
the ship in which his berth had been taken from starting. So
poor Oliver was forced to return to Westminster, where, once
more, the absurd freaks of his illustrious companion constantly
got him into trouble. It was the favourite manoeuvre of Charles
to lure Oliver into taking a hot bath in the Palace. The moment
the favourite was safely covered with water, his incorrigible
associate used to annex his clothes, leaving him only an old dressing-
gown in their place. Then Charles would tell Oliver that he was
off for a month, and that he (Oliver) must represent him during his
absence. Fearful that the joking of his royal friend should be dis-
covered, the luckless Cromwell had to consent. During these trips
of Charles, Oliver used to keep his room, under the pretext of a
bad cold. He was forced to avoid seeing anyone for fear of identifi-
cation, and would only sign what was given him by Charles's
Ministers, when the papers were pushed under the door of the King's
bed-chamber. To make matters worse, Charles was constantly
opposing Royalty in the character of Cromwell, and, to use his own
words, "mixing up things amazingly." Poor Oliver, quite unused
to affairs of State, signed everything recklessly, including the death-
warrant of Lord Strafford, who was thus beheaded accidentally.
In spite of this warning, the King grew fonder and fonder of
his masquerading, and Cromwell was nearly always established in
the Palace. He remonstrated in the most solemn manner with his
royal friend, and once actually refused to he a party any longer to
his master's deceptions.
"On your allegiance, Sir," cried Charles, haughtily, " I bid you
to remain as you are. I hate State, and infinitely prefer to be
known as Oliver Cromwell to playing the part of the Monarch.
Not another word. I command you, on your allegiance, to obey me.'
Thus ordered, the young man could only submit, so great was his
reverence for the royal dignity. But, as Charles's absences became
longer and longer, matters grew worse in the country, and Cromwell,
atJength, after a series of adventures (resulting from a number
of very elaborate practical jokes), found himself a close prisoner
at Whitehall. Here, in the character of his servant, the King
visited him.
"Sire," cried Olives,, falling upon one knee, "see to what straits
you have brought me. I am actually going to be tried for you, and
the probabilities are that I Bhall be beheaded in your place I With
the greatest possible respect, may I suggest that this is too much,
too much I"
"There is a great deal of sense in what you say, my dear Noll,"
replied Charles, "but I could not help succumbing to the tempta-
tion of seeing you floundering about in my boots and crown. You
made such a mess of the Scotch campaign; and, oh! you were
perfectly killing when you ran away at Naseby! I wonder how you
managed to keep up my character, and that no one discovered you P"
"I was forced to feign a toothache. Your Majesty," explained
Cromwell, "and consequently walked about for several months
with my head tied up in a bundle."
"Ha, ha !" laughed Charles. "Well, my dear OxiYXR, this is
the last trial to which you shall be subjected, but you must let dm
have one joke more," and then he explained his plans.
In the character of the King, Cromwell was tried and condemned.
He was ordered to be beheaded. On the day before the oxeontiun,
Charles (disguised as Oliver) called upon him with a large bundle.
"See here! " said he, as he opened the package, "here in a panto-
mime head of myself. You will wear this to-morrow, ami 1 lie exe-
cutioner (who is in the secret) will chop this off instead of your own.

"The Great Block-Head Trick; or, that's how it's done."
The only person who knows of the little trick is good Bishop Jcxon.
Isn't the idea a humorous one?" Cromwell was forced to confess
that the notion was undeniably quaint.
"You are a good fellow, Oliver," cried Charles, with some emo-
tion, "lam sorry, by my thoughtless gaiety, to have put you to so
much inconvenience." „ T
"Say no more, Sire," replied Cromwell, falling on his knees. 1
would do anything in the saored cause of Monarchy. Long live the
King I" The next day the execution took place, and the big bead
of Charles the First was cut off with due solemnity. The Xing,
who would insist upon " seeing the fun," was concealed beneath the
scaffold. Suddenly His Majesty shouted out, "Remember! —a
proceeding which afterwards subjected Juxon to thousands ot
inquiries (by post and personal) as to what was the meaning ot tne
word—and the ceremony was over. ,. , . .
It remains only to be said, that, after this. Oliver retired into
private life, and Charles (assuming his friend's name and appear-
ance) took his place at Whitehall. The latter was a. most successiul
Administrator, and was for many years honoured as the tm
Protector." When they both died, there was some confusion about
the sites of their respective graves, for reasons which, alter ims
explanation, will be sufficiently obvious. The story is now lost
in the mist of ages, but one thing is very certain, ttat""'.;
Cromwell richly merited the proud title of "the Monarchy s
Defender." ^^^^___

MOKE WAGGERY.
We were delighted to see that a Museum had been opened by and
in connection with the employe's of the South-Western Railway. A
glance at the Catalogue shows at onoe how important and interesting
this Exhibition must be.
No. 1. "The Train that was Punctual."—An oil-painting repre-
senting one of those occurrences in the history of the S.-W. K.
which are so curious and strange as well to deserve the attention of
the Artist. Note the delirious joy on the faces of the passengers,
and the dazed look of the officials.
No. 37. " We are Seventeen."—A water-colour. The painter has
slily parodied the words of the great Poet to give point to his
humorous design. The interior of a first-class railway carriage is
depicted, filled, as the picture's title denotes, with seventeen pas-
sengers. It is impossible to describe this work in detail, but the
visitor should not fail to observe the young Lady into whose face a
bullet-headed ruffian is puffing tobacco-smoke. We think that a
race-day at Epsom, Goodwood, Ascot, Sandown, or Eempton is
hinted at by the capital group in the far corner, where four men are
playing cards over the body of an old clergyman. Can these men be
Welshers P They look like it. By a happy inspiration which
amounts to genius, the Artist has thrown up in strong relief the
announcement, "This compartment to hold eight passengers."
No. 84. "A Model of a Third-class Carriage."—Though only on
the scale of a quarter of an inch to a yard, so admirably is this model
executed that as one looks at it, one can feel the discomfort that
would attend a journey in the original; one can smell the close,
dusty, dirty odour that would accompany one on that journey; one
can conjure up the dawdling rate between stations, the long stop-
pages at stations, which would be an essential part and parcel of
that journey. This model deserves more than a passing look.
No. 111. " Which Platform?"—Thus is a spirited little sketch.
A Gentleman, whose luggage is labelled " Midhurst," is putting the
question, "Which platform?" to a crowd of Guards and Inspectors
who, by the good-humoured puzzledom on their countenances, are
evidently unable to answer the conundrum. They give it up. The
agony on the questioner's face is really comic; while the chagrin on
the face of his wife, who fears missing the train, is equal to the
best work of any of our satirical Artists. A delicious confusion is
added to the tout ensemble by the delineation of porters carrying
various articles of luggage, all labelled "Midhurst," to different
platforms.
No. 200. "How Beautiful is Sleep ! "—A tender, touching picture
representing a signalman in his box, enjoying that repose whioh
fourteen hours' incessant work has surely entitled him to.
No. 250.—Surely there is some mistake in the numbering here.
"250 " in the Catalogue is set down as " A Meeting of the Directors
of the S.-W. JR." "250 " on the walls represents a drove of asses
eating thistles in a field. We trust that before our next visit this
mistake will be rectified.

easily supply the place of the former by common ochre, and substi-

a bequest of £10,000 to be applied
to the relief of soldiers, of good

in the Servioe. That Woodman
was a jolly good feller. A Com-
mittee has now been formed,
under the Chairmanship of Gene-

invite subscriptions with a view
to carrying on the good work
begun by Mr. Woodman. Mr.

An Englishman, theoretically, is the freest Citizen under the sun;
hut praotically he is the slave of the Licensing System. The Tax-
colleotor treats him as a full-grown man; the Licensing System
treats him as a sucking child. He may pass his days in filling up
Income-tax papers, or appealing against excessive rates, but his
evenings are regulated by an iron rule that would not be tolerated
for an hour in St. Petersburgh or Siberia.
If he goes to any Musio-Hall he must not see a play, although the
proprietor is willing to give him one, and yet both he and the pro-
prietor are twitted with the vulgarity of the entertainment provided.
If he goes to one Musio-Hall he may see danoing—dancing, of course,
upon the stage; if he goes to another Musio-Hall, in another part of
the town, he is forbidden to see danoing.
If he tries to find a place where the audience dance together, as
they do in every Continental oity, he discovers that it is either
closed by Aot of Parliament or sold to howling Salvationists.
If he goes to a Theatre he must not smoke, although the proprietor
is willing, and he must not drink without putting his head in a
cupboard.
If he defers his smoking and drinking until after the Theatre, and
wishes to add a little supper, he is in another difBoulty. He may
have filled up his Income-tax papers in the afternoon, for the third
time, and paid his rates and taxes like a Christian, but, though he
lives in a city of four millions of people,—the largest city in the

take his wife or his grandmother.* He nnds a few hybrid " restau-

THE DIVINING ROD.
My Very Dear Sib.
I observe, with some pleasure, that at the present time a
correspondence is being conducted in the Times on the subjeot of the
Divining Rod. That such a rod has powers of divination seems agreed
to by the majority of the correspondents. No wonder. I had thought
I had settled that matter years ago. You, at least, have every reason
to remember that when one of my promising pupils. Master Harry
Sandford, declined to relate the story of Why Not Hang Arabi, or
the Ungrateful Egyptian, to Master Tommy Merton,:I invoked the
magic of the Divining Rod with so great a success that Master Merton
could no longer protest he had never heard the story before. History
repeats itself. My terms are what they always were to friends, and
I have vacancies for a few boarders. I enclose a few cards to be
distributed among your friends, and remain,

THE NEWEST TALE OF A TUB.
"If by some magic spell EDgland could wake to-morrow physically clean,
she would wake pure also in spirit, and godly in comprehension of goodness."
—Dr. Sichabdson.
He read, and arose with a resolute air.
Quoth he, "If a man may so scrub himself
With soap into saintship, away with all oare!
For my apotheosis I shall prepare."
And he straightway proceeded to tub himself.
He tubbed twice a day to begin with. He found
The results were not what he ezpeoted.
He sighed, "I suppose that the argument's sound,
My naughtiness surely must superabnund,
It makes a man feel quite dejeoted."
However, he purchased a tub three times bigger,
And laved himself in it thrice daily.
The scrubbing he gave to his figure, with vigour,
Was hearty enough to have whitened a nigger,
Yet still wicked thoughts nourished gaily.
Said he, "Well, I must be a shocking bad lot!
However, I won't be defeated."
He bought tons of soap, had his bath scalding hot,
And it seemed that scarce out of one tub he had got,
Ere he in another was seated.
The soap seemed to permeate body and soul,
The heat made him squirm and ejaculate,
Yet though not entirely an ogre or ghoul,
As regards moral impulses he, on the whole,
Still felt himself far from immaculate.
He took Turkish baths every day for a week,
Until he could stand them no longer.
Said he, "Oh! I ought to be pure, now, and meek,
Temptations no more should my soul dutch and twtak,
But, hang it 1 they only seem stronger."
"Although I 'm as snowy as clarified lard,
My pulses at times flutter oddly;
I still like Burlesque and a secular Bard,
I feel I should like to hit Richabdson—hard;
All which I am sure can't be godly.
"Yet, stay !—'tis a grubby old world to be sure,
To keep dust and dirt out were clever.
I guess that to keep oneself perfectly pure,
And one's virtue from every assault to secure,
One ought to be tubbing/or ever."
To be stuck to his tub, like Diogenes, save
That the old Cynio's tub was a dry one,
Yet, do what he would, rub and Borub, soak and lave,
He found himself still very often a slave
To the wioked desires that so try one.
"Alas!" he exclaimed, "'tis the world that's in fault,
There always seems something to dirt you—
The least flying mite, I suppose, makes you halt,
And each falling smut is, I guess, an assault
On that sensitive substance—your virtue."
Unless—but, ah, no 1 from the thought one must shrink,
In view of the theory tubbish,
That Richardson holds as perfection's pure pink—
Unless, ah! unless one could possibly think
Learned Doctors do sometimes talk rubbish.
"He bowled a maiden over," said Mrs. Ramsbotham's Nephew,
describing a cricket-match. "Poor thing! I hope Bhe wasn't much

LATEST FROM STAMBOUL.
[From Our Own Special Wire-Pulkr.)
Lord D-ff-r-n to Lord Or-nv-lle.—I say, 'when are you going to settle about
Egypt? Sorry to hurry you, but Sublime Porto is getting furious. Have
greatest difficulty in keeping Sultan even passably polite, to say nothing about
being in a good humour. Spent £500 (Turkish) yesterday in backsheesh on his
entourage. Entourage has great influence over nim. To-day, however, he's as
bad as ever. Have just sent him soothing note, and promised him five thousand
preference shares in Grand Central Trunk Asian and Arabian Railway,
when made.
Lord Gr-nv-lle to Lord D-ff-r-n.—You're the boy for the post! Nothing
like a Paddy for a Padishah. Excuse me, this is one of Gl-dst-ne's jokes.
"We 're all in such high spirits here. Bless Wolheley! Your conduct as to
backsheesh and preference shares highly approved. Keep Sultan waiting just
a leetle longer! Not quite made up our minds about Egypt. When we have,
will wire at once.
Lord D-ff-r-n to Lord Gr-nv-lle.—Sublime Porte quite unbearable to-day.
Do decide quick! Where's the difficulty? Have just had to send five sticks
of best liquorice and box of French chocolate-creams to eaoh individual member
of Harem. If this doesn't keep Sultan quiet for a little time, shall take trip in
Black Sea for benefit of my health, don't you know, and so keep out of way. Glad
to hear you 're all in such high spirits. Wish I were.
Lord Gr-nv-lle to Lord D-ff-r-n.—Gl-dst-ne 's just made a screamer!
Desires me to telegraph it to you. "In what condition is the Sublime Porte just
at present? Why, crusty, to be sure!"
Lord D-ff-r-n to Lord Gr-nv-lle.—Not bad, but how about business? Porte
still very fractious.
Lord Gr-nv-lle to Lord D-ff-r-n.—Business? Oh, ah! Government quite
upholds your action about liquorice and chocolate-creams. But you must have
patience. We 're trying to get round France; only DrcLKEC is so unreasonable.
He won't see that Tunis, Madagascar, and man-eating savages at mouth of
Congo, are sufficient exchange for French rights in Egypt. Your cue is,
"received no instructions." Gl-dst-ne. who's just stepped in to Foreign
Office, says this is "cuerious, but true." Begs me to wire this remark; thinks
it may amuse you.
Lord D-ff-r-n to Lord Gr-nv-lle.—In consequence of the chocolate creams
coming to an end, Sublime Porte has just sent in "Categorical demand for
explanations on subject of Egypt." Wants to know why we 're still there, when
we 're going to leave, &c. Have just tried Sultan with
promise of a first charge on North Borneo dividends,
when declared. Don't know if this will have good effect.
He threatens to appeal to Powers!
Lord Gr-nv-lle to Lord D-ff-r-n.—Padishah mutt
not appeal to Powers. Would give Russia just the excuse
she wants for intermeddling. Can't you find somebody
else who's got influence over Sultan P
Lord D-ff-r-n to Lord Gr-nv-lle.—Found a Circassian,
who says he's related to whole Harem, and has immense
influence. Tried him. First gave him, as backsheesh,
some chocolate-creams. As he hadn't had anything to
eat for five days, said he would prefer a beef-Bteak. This
made me suspioious. Head Dragoman called in, who
at onoe recognised fellow as low-class Levantine tioket-
of-leave man, not a Circassian at all! S. P. peculiarly
rampant to-day. Meanwhile, I advise Government to
keep eye on Russia on Danube and in Armenia. Verb. sap.
Lord Gr-nv-lle to Lord D-ff-r-n.—Why not go another
£500 (Turkish) in conciliating entourage t Government
will support you. Have got my eye on Russia; also
on France; ako on Germany, Austria, Roumania, Monte-
negro, Italy, and Spain. .Trying position: and here's the

"I'm always thinking about nothing, Auntie. I never think about
ANYTHING, UNLESS I HAPPEN TO THINK OF SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT."
THE SCHOOL-BOARD ELECTIONS.
Dear Mb. Punch,
The Lords of the Committee of Council on
Education have issued regulations for the forthcoming
Election of Members of the School-Board, and I am
informed that there is one of these of which, I am
sure, Mr. Punch, you will cordially approve. No one
is henceforth to be eligible as a Member of the School-
Board unless he or she has passed the Sixth Standard
prescribed by the Education Code. The necessity for
some provision of this kind is so obvious that we are
surprised their Lordships of the Council of Education
never thought of it before. In this age of competitive
examinations, when we insist on sending every little
ragamuffin in the streets through the Education mill,
those who are intrusted with the work ought surely to
know something about it.
Now, the Board has from the first exhibited much
enthusiasm, much eloquence (especially among the lady
members), and a noble scorn of that sordid rabble, the
ratepayers, who have the audacity to raise their voices
against its extravagance. This is all right and proper.
But could any of these Ladies or Gentlemen who talk
so glibly of the advantages of Education pass the Sixth
Standard? Could the worthy and laborious Chairman?
—could the great Munpella himself pass it? Do they
even know, or do you know, Mr. Punch, what the Sixth
Standard is P * I am sure I don't. I have a confused
notion that the Fifth Standard means Literature and
Mathematics; but whether the Sixth Standard means
Astronomy or Gastronomy, or Sanscrit, or Hebrew, or
Arabic, I cannot tell. But in theBe days of cramming
much may be done in a month, and the Candidates for
the School-Board have still a month before the elec-
tion to qualify themselves as members.
Meanwhile, Mr. Punch, I am sure you will airree with
me that the public are much indebted to the Education
Committee for the very salutary provision which they
have now for the first time introduced.
I remain, respeotfully yours,
A Disteessed Ratepayer.

They are trying Ababi. What is Ababi? Is it something good
to eat? Is it gum? Does it stick? "Yes," Bays the Khedive,
loudly. "No," softly whispers the Sultan. Is he a liberator? A
liberator of whom? Also of which? Or, to put it more plainly, of
where? When? How? By no means! Admitted! To continue.
The Egyptian People shall be, and shall be great till the Twentieth
Century. They shall be—what? Which? Why? At this time it
has not come into being. It! Yes, it! What it? That it! Is he
a belligerent? He! Yes, he! Then that implies war! Now at
this moment war does not exist. To have war there must be peace.
And peace, when properly understood or misunderstood, implies
war. These are military facts as to which England will have to
give explanations. When? With the Twentieth Century? May
be! Perhaps! But England is not at war with Egypt. England
is not at war with Turkey. But then she is at peace with neither.
This is a mystery which has but one solution—when?
What, then, is Arabe? Is he gum? Pshah! Or is he Ababi
Pasha? This is trilling! He is a prisoner! We, the passerB-by,
the unknown, the first comers, the last comers, the too-late-for-
diners, we exist, we live, and the Government labour close to us.
What Government? When? Yes? Or, to speak more plainly—
no? What then do they conceal from us? We do not know it! He
does not know it. She or it does not know it. Perhaps they them-
selves do not know it—themselves! But we see what they do not
see! We Bee before us the depths of the horizon, the comb of the
North Pole, the nose of the equator! We know what the future is
about. We see something or other crumbling away in the East,
something else collapsing in the West, and Africa awaking to civili-
sation. This is what we see, and a great deal more. What more?
Why? Which? The Government are in the dark—we are in the
light! They do not know about what, they are talking—no more
do we. But we, yes, we, are content? Why are we content? Because
the penalty of death has summarised the criminal jurisdictions of
the olden legislations of the primaeval developments of a glorious
future concealed in a paragraph! Yes? No? To-day it is judged
and condemned I When? Firstly! Secondly! And fourthly!
Why not thirdly? Because there is not a single enlightened Jury-
man who consents to sign it. Sign what? Here, people stop us!
It is no longer an angel, it is a spectre! It is more, a bottle—an
empty bottle! A bottle that was full thirty minutes ago! With
what? With wine? It is empty now. Why? Has it been
emptied by an old Poet? Perhaps! So little is it empty that it will
be tilled again! When? Soon! It is to be hoped so!
Ababi is going to be shot! That language surprises but does not
disquiet us. All language would surprise us, but none would
disquiet us! It is very curious! Civilisation does not kill without
exactly knowing why. At least, if Civilisation does kill without
exactly knowing why. Civilisation is an ass! Yes, an ass! A great
ass! Never »aw such an ass as Civilisation is if—you know—it
kills without exactly knowing why 1

MUCH ADO AT THE LYCEUM.
Tete Bard has said, "What's in a name?" And, evidently, he
didn't care what title he gave to a piece, as long as his audience
called it good. What a bad title is Much Ado About Nothing, and
what a delightful specimen of the poetic Comedy.
This play is a Comedy of practical jokes, in which all the charac-
ters, with the excep-
tion of Dogberry and
Verges, take part.
First, Leonato, a
mean - spirited old
toady, who loves a
Nobleman and adores
a Prince, joins with
Claudio and Don
Pedro in a very
stupid practical joke
against their friend
Benedick: secondly,
Hero, Leonato't un-
interesting daughter,
joins with her wait-
ing-maids in another
practical joke of a
similar kind against
her own sister Bea-
trice: thirdly, Don

"I will go get her Portrait.'
£
John, out of malice, sets on foot a cruel praotical joke against Hero,
which Borachio and Margaret successfully oarry out: fourthly, the
Friar, old Leonato, and his worthy brother Antonio, concoct another
practical joke between them, originally suggested by the Friar, to
play at burying Hero; and, fifthly, the same trio keep up the joke,
by pretending that all will be forgiven if
Claudio will marry Hero's cousin, who, on
the removal of her veil, turns out to be
Hero herself.
Now, out of all these praotical jokers, old
and young, there is but one who has the
decency and the good feeling to regret, as a
gentleman, his share in the transaction
which was fraught with such serious conse-
quences to the unfortunate Hero. Borachio,
as played by Mr. Tyars, commands our
sympathies, and, when he is walked off in
custody, we sincerely hope that he will only
be reprimanded, warned against keeping
bad company, and let off after giving some-
thing to the poor-box.
There are few more difficult parts to play,
in the villanous line, than that of Don
John, who, apparently, hasn't a redeeming
point. Mr. Glenny made this bad cha-
racter as good as possible, and as little
melodramatic as it can be.
The two old Foozles, Leonato and Antonio,
are turned into respectable elderly gentlemen by Mr. Fernandez
and Mr. Howe, who do their best to give them all the dignity to
which their rich costumes should entitle them.
Mr. Meab, as the Friar, is a model ecclesiastic of the period. He

unforeseen emergency, and the life and soul of an evening party
when everything ends happily. It is the Friar who, with a strong
sense of humour, suggests the practical joke of pretending that Hero
is dead, as a retaliation on Claudio and Don Pedro. This ecclesiastic's
influence with the other members of his own religious community
serving the Cathedral at Messina must have been so great that he could
actually induce them to join him in the practical joke, and to carry it
so far as to sing a dirge at the family vault, where they pretend Hero
is buried; and, further, he must have squared it with them satisfac-
torily, to prevent their informing his Bishop or the General of the
Order, or even the Pope himself, of his slightly eccentric conduct.
This Friar was a Regular Rum'un.
The scene in the Cathedral, representing a splendid side-chapel,
was simply as effective and in as excellent good taste as an Artist
like _ Mr. Telbin, and a Stage-Manager like Mr. Ihvino, could
possibly make it.
The scene between Benedick and Beatrice in the chapel couldn't
have taken place if the Vergers or Beadles
had done their duty. English tourists,
however, generally behave worse than this
in any Continental Cathedral.
Shakspeare created some low-comedy
characters, such as Dogberry, Sir Andrew
Aguecheek, and Bottom, whose fun has
hitherto been looked upon as independent
of the Actor; characters, in fact, whioh
"played themselves." Such, as regards
Dogberry, was our firm conviction until
this revival of Much Ado about Nothing, at
the Lyceum, utterly dispelled the cherished
illusion.*
Here Mr. Irvino's Benedick and Miss
Ellen Terry's Beatrice are everything,
about whom there will be much ado
for some time to come, while the immortal
Dogberry is one of the class set down by
Hamlet as "tedious old fools." Mr. Lionel
Brocgti, Mr. Hill, or Mr. Paulton could
have done something with it, specially Mr. Hill, whose Dogberry
should be a thing to see and to remember, second only to Robert
Keeley's, which we did see and shall never forget. Ye gods! how
we laughed! — but then, you and I, Ben Bolt, were "boys
together."
We must not forget to mention Mr. F. Robertson's Musical
Entertainment alfresco in Leonato't garden, where Balthazar, the
Arthur Roberts, or the Great Vance of the period, was hired, with
some wandering minstrels as accompanists, to oblige old Foozle's
guests with his evidently popular song and its popular (because
idiotic) chorus of ''Hey, Nonny, Nonny." He sings it most artis-
tically, and throws such a sly-dog expression into the refrain that we
doubt whether a Mediaeval Meddlevex Magistrate would have granted
a licence to any Hall where the Great Balthazar was announced to

"Write rue down an Ass."

give his " Hey, Nonny, Nonny" every evening. In the nineteenth
century we should soon have seen him outside a two-and-sixpenny
song: printed in colours. He sings it most artistically, and the acting
of his auditors is one of the best individualistic charaoter-bits in the
piece. Mr. Terris, the Prince, listens politely, on account of his old
host, but is evidently bored, and has heard it frequently before.
Mr. Robertson, as Claudio, a rather esthetic young man, follows the
air with his head and appears patronisingly interested. Old Leonato
thrums the tune with his fingers, nods and smiles at all the points,
* That this tradition about Dogberry is pretty generally held, is accident-
ally apparent in Mr. Traill's monograph of Stern* (one of the English Mm
of Letters Series), when he says, " It is not the repartees of Benedick and
Beatrice, but the immortal fatuity of Dogberry that the name of Much Ada
About Nothing recalls." Now, had Mr. Traill seen Mitch Ado at the
Lyceum, with Mr. Irvino and Miss Ellen Tbrry as Benedick and Beatrice,
and Mr. Johnson as Dogberry, he could never have honestly written th«
above sentence.

Mr. Irving's Benedick is the performance of a genuine Comedian,

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER.
Sumtimes when bizzyness is rayther slack, when.for instans, the
Copperashun and the Livery Cumpnies is all out of Town a-washing
theirselves in the briny Hoshun, so to have a
alastick skin and a olean conBhence for the
coming hard work of Nowember, I sets myself
down before the fire in our privet dining-room,
1& suttenly the kosiest and the comfortablest little
dining-room in all Yourrope, as far as I knows,
and amuses myself by trying to unravel mm of
the missterrys of my exohequered existence;
sumtimes turtel and wenaon and 47 port, sum-
times a mutting chop and a liar i' of bitter! What
a change is there, my fellow countrymen! And
there's this mostremarkabel suokemstance about
this striking contrast. Wen I has the In series,
I pays nothink for 'em, wen 1 has the common food of the mere
working-man, I has to pay for it. Tho' I 'in. told this applys to
others as well as to me.
Another remarkable fao forces itself on my atenshun. "When in the
full bloom and blossom of the Season, when the hole hatmosfere
seems perfewmed with the scent of Wenson and high living, and I am
a-partaking amost daily, in the shape of waifs and strays I means,
of course, of the xquisit dellycases above eluded to, I am one of the
staunohest Conservatives as ever looked for'ard with pleasure to nex
iday, but when 1'm redoooed to the meen fair as 1 feels too ashamed
to menshun again. I feels creeping over my constitootional feelings
a tort of hungry Raddicle noahun that things ain't quite as they
ought to be, and requires great holterations to make 'em just as I
should like 'em.
Leaving the unwailing of this puzzle to some great Feelosopher,
suoh as Marwood Topper, or Mr. Badlaw, or to some hungry Irish
Land Leaguing M.P. when he hears as how as the Ameriken supplies
is stopt, and that oonsekwently the Dry Hideandseek and the Sweet
Click Oh! is stopt too, I turns my thorts to another Pint.
What kind and bountiful prowisions of Natur they do seem, that
when she sends us somethink speshally good she sends us such a jolly
lot of it! Take '47 Port for instans. Ah 1 if all Port Wine was
like that, we shouldn't be much trubbled with the unnohle Army of
Blue ribboners. But of course it tizzent.
Well, now I 've been a member of, and I trust a ornyment to, my
dextinguished perfession a matier of nearly 20 year. During the
entire hole of that long period, all reel Gentlemen, that is to say, all
them as can afford it, or can get somebody else to pay for it, has all
a-bin calling for '47 Port, and has all got it, as they thinks. And in
all the many Hottels and Tavverns which has a wailed theirselves of
my, I trust, usefool services, I never knew but one as had the pluok
to say they hadn't got none.
Well, then, as nobody could think of douting anybody's weras-
sity as moved in so high a spear of life as a Tavern Keeper and
went to Church of a Sunday, where on airth did it all come from?
Everybody of course says O, Port oh! which seems only natteral, but
Brown has the ordassity to say that as in other silly brated cases we
says, "Any Port in a Storm," so in this werry puzzling case he says,
and they says, any Port will do after about the second bottle, so there
isn't so werry much drunk after all. And, he adds, there's werry
old orthority for the same thing having been done long ago.
But what I prinsepully complains of is, that while the Govner
gits all the profit out of a grand feast of reason, that is, the best that
can be had, and the flow of wine of the finest wintages, we poor
Waiters gits all the abuse. And how heartfully it 'a all manidged.
TJp oomes the Govner just after the soup's over, when everybody [a
just had his glass of punch or my deary, as the oase may be, and is
having his fish and a-thinking of the coming joy of a hontray, and
is of course in capital humour and good spemts, and he speaks just
a few bits of gammon to the principal swells about how well they
looks and how glad he is to see 'em again, ansetterer, and the swells
all smiles and looks jolly pleased, and then away goes the Govner
and out he gos for a walk, and takes preshus good care not to come
baok till they 're all gone.
Ah! what we has to bear when the Port "Wine goes round nobody
can tell but a lied Waiter. A junior oan plead higneranse, and truly
so, hut that wouldn't do for me. A confession of higneranse would
be f atel to my oarackter. So I has to go through the hordeal as best
I can, and to indulge ocashunally in a amount of unwerassity that I
reelly thinks ought to be considered in my wages. Robert.

ARRIVAL OF THE HOUSEHOLD TROOPS.
{By Our Own Special Old Soldier.)
You had ordered _ me out to welcome the Householders on their
return. Enthusiastically I oheyed. 1 prepared to receive Cavalry
in the morning by dining on the 'previous evening with a distin-
guished warrior, who was keeping watch over the sovereigns
of England at the Bank, where at 11 p.m. they first turn out
the visitors, and then turn out the guard. We drank to the
health of the Householders, and sang about the glorious conse-
quences to ourselves, "When Johnnies come marching home."
Well, Sir, it was a splendid sight. Unique! A thing one
only sees once in a lifetime unless one lives to see it again,
but as the John Gilpin Bard exclaimed, "And when they next do
ride (home from) abroad, May I be there to see 1"
Your order was, "Be up early." I was. Very early. I waited
up till even the waiters could wait no longer, and tie hail-porter was
fast asleep in his old arm-chair. I confess I did not see the use of
being up so early as it involves late rising; still, you had com-
manded, and I did it.
The morning of Friday (4 a.m.) opened with the ringing of bells
and shouting, as I had forgotten my latch-key, and my own House-
hold Brigade was fast asleep. I pass over the remaining few hours,
and come to the time when I started to see the triumphal progress
of the Blues. I had a bad headache, and such a depressed feeling
that I began to think I was in the blues myself. But I pulled
myself together like one man, and whispered in my mind's ear,
Horatio Nelson, the one word, "Duty."
To do full honour to the occasion, I mounted the charger, which I
had bought, on your account, Sir, at a reoent Circus sale (where the
Auctioneer said to me, "It was Myers', and now it's Yours"—
not bad for Mr. R-m-ll), and assuming my celebrated attitude of the
Commendatore Statue in Don Giovanni, I gave my steed his head
(a little birthday present), and, carrying his own tail, he bore me
proudly on. showing, by his paces, that he was conscious of carrying
C.xsab, and his fortunes. I do not know what Cesar without his
fortunes rode, but it is my fortune to ride about sixteen stone, and as
light as a fairy at that—only on ne badine pas avec a sixteen-stoner.
Arrived at Fitzroy Square, I saw that to attempt to charge the
crowd and the policemen in the New Road would have been glorious
—but impossible. So, with a great knowledge of country, I got
round by the side-streets to Portland Place. Sir, what a pretty
sight! All along those streets the balconies were orowded by maid-
servants !" The Maids of Merry England how beautiful are they!"
I sang, as my eye caught their smiling faces. Upon my word, I never
saw so many female domestics gathered together before. _ And this,
too, in the bye-streets, where not a glimpse could be obtained of the
procession, and scarcely a note of the martial music, or even the faintest
eoho of cheers of the populace could be heard. I was really glad for
their sokes, poor dears, that one solitary horseman was seen passing
along, so as to present in a sketchy manner to their imaginations the
equestrian triumph which they were totally unable to see.
Then, along the streets the crowd poured, more nursery-maids,
and such a number of perambulators, as to suggest the idea of there
being a grand baby-snow somewhere in the neighbourhood of the
Regent's Park. But, on second thoughts, this was, of course, the
Infantry preparing to receive Cavalry.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FROM OUR BEWIL-
DERED "SPECIAL."
This has been about the
dullest week I have known
for many years—even in the
dull season. There is abso-
lutely nothing stirring but
stagnation. The war is over,
and very little is to be made
out of the return of the
troops. The comet has dis-
appeared. There are several
murders, but none having any
romantic features or publio
interest. A fog appeared for
a few hours—a tolerably dense
fog—but it cleared off as ra-
pidly as it came. One or two
slight railway accidents have
been reported, but nothing
worthy of a special visit.
The Ship-Canal at Manchester
and the Channel Tunnel are
rather shadowy at present.
A jocular friend says that
neither of them wiil hold
water. He is wrong about
the Tunnel. A diamond rob-
bery has been spoken of. but
there is nothing in it. There
has been no fire worth men-
tioning. For want of any-
thing oetter to do, a lot of us
have had to go to a sale by
auction of Circus effects. The
proprietor, like many philoso-
phers, tried to square the
circle, and failed. His pro-
perties fetched very little. He
might have thought of that
maxim of Proudhon's '\La
proprie'te' c'est le vol," which,
being theatrically translated,
means "the property-man is
a thief." Several elephants
and lions were knocked down
by the auctioneer for fairly
good hums. He was a slight
man, but appearances are
deceptive.

offer any.

A TRUE BISHOP-

For fighting the "lie which

to the Bishop of Peterbo-

would promote a good thing,
temperance, at the expense of
a oetter, reasonable liberty,
and the spiritual charlatans
who would corrupt religion at
its very springs by associating
it with hysteria, sensational-
ism, irreverence, and the most
blatantly vulgar self-assur-
ance, find in Bishop Magee
that most formidable foe of
fanatical muddleheadedness—
a man who can distinguish.
The most insidious of evils
are bad things done in a good
cause. Confused minds fail
to discriminate one from the
other, good hearts shrink from
attacking the evil lest they
should Be suspected of op-
posing the good. So the
spurious often escapes detec-
tion, like base coin whioh,
flourished in the cause of
charity, many shrink from
nailing to the counter. Men
who, like Bishop Magee. are
down on this base coin like
a hammer," do the Publio a
greater service than the Publio

—" Always a Loan."
At a bold trot I rode through the Regent's Park-gates furthest
removed from the crowd, and passednp by Colisseum Terrace. The
first opening, near Chester Terrace, was blocked by oabs and car-
riages—so was the second. Again I urged on my wild career, and
made a dashing advance on the gate that leads on to the "York and
Albany." Here gallant Policemen were stopping all traffic. I tried
to explain that I was not traffic. I told them that I had a cousin in
the 10th Lancers; that I was only going to see a friend in Albany
Street; that I had a message for the Prince of "Wales; that I was
sent on urgent business, and that it would be fatal to a dying
relative in Albany Street, just opposite the Barracks, if they
didn't let me pass. I told them I was bearing a reprieve: in
fact, Sir, I told them everything that a man of probity and unsullied
honour could without bringing the blush to the cheek—or without
making anyone blush for the cheek,—but they were firm; and, as
at that moment the first strains of the distant band were heard, and
my steed began to show by his manners that he was familiar with
the air, I thought it best to retrace my steps, and make another
dashing charge in a different direotion. By the way, I don't buy a
six-guinea circus-horse again, even on your account—at least, if I
do buy him for you, I won't ride him.
Then arose the cheers—vociferous, loud, and long; and then, with
the cheers, arose my horse on his hind legs, and just as the great
event of the day was coming off, I took the initiative, and came off
first. A groomy-looking person collared its head, and said he 'd hold
it if I liked to dodge in among the carriages, and see what I could
see. I thanked him, and dodged.
I was just in time to oheer the last trooper as he rode in; and as
I made a dash at the gallant fellow's hand, he said something to me
in a language which I fancy was Egyptian, and before I had time to
obtain a translation, I found myself fainting, from excitement, in
the arms of two policemen. It was a glorious day.
• •••••
I am still looking for the groomy man and the noble steed.
Should you see a pale sawdusty-coloured horse with weak eyes,
looking as if he 'd been up for several nights, and a pinkish guinea-
piggy sort of nose, that's mine.
Of course I must include his loss in my expenses out of pocket as
your Special Correspondent, sent out in your interests; therefore
you can advertise for him yourself, and when you get him, he's yours

OPENING AND CLOTURE OF PARLIAMENT.

TOBY AND THE MUZZLE-LOADERS.
BETTER THAN HIS PROMISE.
The announcement that the Laureate has determined once more
to tempt dramatio fortune, and this time not in the flowery meads of
his own acoustomed verse, hut in the comparatively barren wastes of
unfamiliar prose, has, naturally enough, occasioned considerable stir
in literary and artistio circles, and Mr. Punch has already been
asked numerous questions on the subject. As the play is now
definitely set down for production next month, he thinks, perhaps,
he will not be held guilty of any very grave indiscretion in publish-
ing the following items of correspondence hearing directly on the
origin of what is really a remarkably interesting and novel essay.
It will at least satisfy the curious.
It will be seen that the first document, a letter apparently from
the Lessee, is of the ordinary business kind.
DEAR Bot, Globe Theatre.
Would yon be disposed to write us a thoroughly slap-up
Sensational Drama, in as many Acts as you like, and let us have it
in at an early date? One proviso, however, it must be in prose.
Don't make it "Cuppy." You understand: domestio and all that
sort of thing. A line by return, stating lowest terms, will oblige,
Yours, &c, &o.
To the ahove the Laureate replied as under. It is curions to note
the difficulty he evidently experienced in penning an unrhythmical
reply. Indeed he appears to have given it up. Subjoined is his
Dear Sir,—Your favour just to
hand;
And thus I haste in hot reply
To own I am disposed to try
Another venture in the Strand!
And you would have my play in
prose?
Well, well—I 'm game for any-
thing !—
I only ask that I may sing
Until the house I fairly close.
And yet I somehow trust that
chaff
May find no place in papered
Stall ;—
This effusion of the Laureate's, though eminently polite and
straightforward, was not considered satisfactory from a purely busi-
ness point of view; no reference being made in it either to the date
of delivery, style and title of the play, or even to the leading Lady
to he engaged. A rather sharp letter from Mr. Kki.lt, the Stage-
Manager, however, was at once promptly answered by the following
telegram:—
ThatImay get. atleast, a "call,"
And cross the lights without a
laugh.
So count that you shall have your
will;
While I once more to all make
plain
That I subserve no other's gain
Although I figure in the bill.
Then make the most you can of me;
Believing though in downward
flight
I shall expect so much per night,
I 'm yours sincerely,
Alfred T.
From 1'ennyson, Freshwater, to Kelly, Globe Theatre.
In October you shall have the play quite early, Kn.i.v dear:
And I 'm going to write the leading part for Mrs. Bernard Bere:
For Mrs. Bernard Berk, Kellt,—a genius in her way,—
And 1 've called it the Promise of May, Kellt, I 've called it the
Promise of May.
This, still failing in making any proposition as to terms, elicited
immediately the following rejoinder: —
From Kelly, Globe Theatre, to Tennyson, Freshwater.
Thanks for yours just received. Title a trifle weak. Sounds like
a Criterion Screamer. As wo are already billingthe thing all over
the place with Sandwiches, how about terms? What do you say to
five hundred for all rights? Think I could get B to run to this.
Wire back. Answer paid.
The ahove appears to have brought the highly gifted author to the
point. He dispatched the following forthwith by the boy:—
Sandwich to right of you,
Sandwich to left of you,
Sandwich in front of you—
Then you 've not blundered!
As to the sum you name—
"Five f "—come—it's rather tame.
There—you shall have your game—
Make it six hundred!
This closed the business, and the play is now in active preparation.
Contenting himself with remarking that after perusing this prelimi-
nary correspondence, he looks forward to the first great prose effort
of the Laureate with much interest, Mr. Punch, for the moment,
reserves any further comment. He, however, hopes to return to the
subject at a fitting opportunity.
"Look always on the Surrey Side"
The man who lives in Kennington or Bermondsey, and wants a
music and dancing lioence, is happy. He gets it, as a matter of
course, without trouble, question, or the expense of counsel. The
Surrey Sessions are got through quietly, without scandal or injustice,
and it might be of some advantage to the publio if the Meddlevex
Magistrates were to attend and watch the proceedings of Mr. Hard-
man and his brethren. There is no Hash-Wednesday on the Surrey
side of the river.
There is much talk at present about Egypt as "the Gate of
India." Bv-and-hy we shall hear more about what may be called
the "Gate Money."
Tell it at Tel-el-Kkbir.—We no longer say, "Tell that to the
Marines." with an incredulous sneer and a shrug of the shoulders.
But we Tell that of the Marines—and that is a tale of bravery and
glory not to be surpassed by any in the recent campaign.

IN THE BEST OF SPIRITS.
The bi-monthly Meeting of the Society for Psychical Research was held
yesterday, and, as usual, attended largely by the supporters of the movement.
The President took the chair, punctually, at midnight; and, on opening the
proceedings, remarked with much sombre and gloomy humour on the excellent
and appropriate arrangement of the Committe Room, the doors and cupboards of
which had all been provided with skeleton keys. A blue fire burning on the
hearth, and agreeably harmonising with the dim light of several lamps, accom-
panied by their own shades, also helped to throw a pleasant flicker over the
assembled company. _
The Chairman then proceeded to read the report in a hollow voice. He said
he had several important statements to make to the Meeting, and some really
very interesting evidence to lay before it. In the first place, he believed, he
was correct in assuming that it was pretty well known to the general Members
of the Society that the Committee, in taking over an assignment of the remainder
of the lease of the premises they at present occupied, did so on a distinot under-
standing, from the late tenant, that they were admirably haunted. (Cheers.)
They might say that they had paid a high premium of several hundred pounds,
not for a few old Venetian blinds, gas-fittings, and a meat-safe, which were
the sole fixtures, but for the ghost—(laughter)—that was said to appear nightly,
under most remarkable conditions, in almost every room in the house. (" Hear,
hear.'") But where was it? (Loud laughter.) No one had seen it. ("Shame!")
Yet the Committee had done all they could to induce it to appear. ("Hear,
hear.'") They had got a nervous housekeeper, subject to hysterical fits on the
slightest mention of an apparition, unconsoiously to occupy chamber after
chamber, but he regretted to say she had invariably slept excellently, and had
never even once been disturbed. (Uproar.) Yes, he could understand that
manifestation of feeling; for the ghost, according to the tradition of the premises,
was said to be an exceedingly satisfactory one. It was nothing more nor less
than a little deoapitated old man in knee-breeches, and a figured blue-satin
coat, teith somebody else's head under his arm. (Prolonged cheering.) His coming
was attended, too, always with most encouraging manifestations. A rumbling
sound, as of coal-porters in chains, and skates tumbling downstairs, overloaded
with too much luggage, was often heard, mingled with irritable shrieks, and
a curious noise like the squeaking of a pig, for hours together. (Laughter.)
And if you adjured the unhappy little old man to tell
you if there was anything you could do to help him, he
only shook the head belonging to somebody else whioh
he held under his arm violently, and said, in an inex-
pressibly mournful voice, "Bromplon and Islington!"
Then he disappeared. (Roars of laughter.) This was cer-
tainly a most interesting psychioal development, and the
Committee had naturally considered a ghost of such
exceptionally first-class character as cheap at the figure.
But still they could not help asking themselves the
question, "What had become of it P" (" Hear ! ")
Professor Porsum rose. He said he did not believe in
these hereditary spectres, and his experience had been
quite in a different direction. He had had remarkable
tilings happening in his own house, but he had never
seen an apparition of any kind. He should be glad to
furnish the Society with some of his personal experi-
ences. (" Hear !") The gas had of late suddenly gone
out several times as he ascended the stairs, and while a
rope seemed to catch his, legs and precipitate him back-
wards into the hall, a waste-paper basket would be
quickly thrust over his head by some unseen agency.
Entering his room at night, a jug of water would fre-
quently be poured mysteriously over his head, drenching
him to the skin, while busts would topple off the book-
cases as he passed, and sometimes explosions take place,
apparently quite capriciously, inside the Early English
clock on the hall-landing, as he went up to bed at night.
(Cheers.) He thought these curious phenomena ought
to occupy the attention of such a Society as theirs,
especially as they were all well attested on unimpeach-
able evidence. He happened to have had four youthful,
but intelligent, nephews staying with him on a visit at
the time, all of whom could corroborate every word of
what he had related, and bear conclusive testimony to
the interesting but oontinued psychical annoyance to
which he had been subjected almost from the very moment
of their arrival. (Cheers.)
Mr. Knight Flyers wished to ask the Chairman a
question. He had a most exciting and thoroughly well
substantiated case of after-death apparition to com-
municate to the Society—(cheers)—but he had just re-
ceived a letter from the solicitors of the exeoutors of
the whole family, threatening him with several actions
for libel if he revealed a word of what the unhappy
spirit had imparted to him. (Roars of laughter.) He
was quite at a loss what to do. (A Voice: "Send it to
a Christmas Number.") That was not a bad idea,
and he thanked the speaker. He would consult the
Company's legal adviser. (" Oh! oh !")
At this point a stranger, who obstinately refused to
give his name, but insisted he had been spending an
evening with the very best spirits, until he found himself
gifted not only with "second," but also with "double
Bight," created considerable confusion by " reading" the
thoughts of the Subscribing Committee, and endeavouring
to enliven the meeting with a ribald commentary on their
reflections. An effort to raise a police in-spectre by
incantation to put the intruder out having sienally failed,
the Chairman adjourned the discussion sine die, and drove
off from the premises in a vampire trap.
A DiFFictrLTY.—"While the Mayor of Windsor was
concocting his address to Colonel Ewart, he was, of
course, a trifle puzzled as to how to use the second person
singular, as lfThou art" wouldn't come well after
"Ewart." "You are" would have sounded like a
spoilt joke, and "Thou are" would have been ungram-
matical. These considerations were the reason for the
omission of the following very telling point, "Who,"
the Mayor was going to ask in declamatory tone, "Who
is a first-rate soldier and a dashing leader? Fellow
Citizens, I turn to Colonel Ewart and I say, Thou art!"
This is where the applause was to have come in, but
the sentence was omitted, and Old Brown Windsor Soap
was tried in another form. The great merit of the
address was, that it elicited one of the manliest and
most telling replies as yet made by any of our gallant
warriors.
"There is no cause for alarm," said Mrs. B-Ajis-
bottiam, "the Doctor examined my chest thoroughly
with the stereoscope, the other day, and pronounced my
lungs to be perfectly sound."

Christmas Cards, for practical purposes, are those with lines on

strongly recommend in the interests of the Christmas Card trade,
because such cards cannot be used twice. Thus, Miss Nelly
Gusher sends one of these to Horatio Skinflint, Esq., and at
the back is written plainly, From Nelly Gusher to Horatio
Skinflint, and the latter is thus prevented from sending it on to

puzzle to us. So for Mr. Hathrrley who, apparently, obtained the
£100 prize for some very pretty designs, but not, to our thinking, worth
such a high prize. If he did obtain it, then it was a very lucky
drawing. For the £75 prize, Miss Linnie Watt, a propos of a
Merry Christmas Card, shows us some children pie-nicking in a

There are so many irrepressible people, who, by reason of their

pity the above Advertiser did not state more distinctly what his
qualifications might be. There is a wide difference between the
Essays of Charles Lamb and Plausible Platitudes by Mr. Drivel-

of an Essayist being to let. It would perhaps be more satisfactory

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A "MERRY WAR" AND A LIVELY PIECE.
If the Merry War, at the Alhambra, were played by the Lively-
Piece-Comedy Company, and if Rip, at the Comedy, were played by
the Alhambra Company, the first would tain considerably, and the
second would not lose much. If the cards of both houses could be
shuffled a bit, both would benefit.
How did the Merry War after its great continental success
come here?
Why—thusly:—
one evening, the
Chairman of the
Alhambra Com-
pany hummed to
himself, "Thing s
isn't at they
used to was in
our Kate Sant-
ley's time," and
another Direc-
tor murmured
the refrain of
"Nobody knows
as I know." Mr.
William Hol-
land (William
the Dutchman)
was annoyed.
"You can't,"
said he, "always
s quite good enough to have a

Army and Ix>;
it
get a popular Kate Saniley;
people's Katerer."
"There was no error about Kate," sighed an eminent Shareholder.
"Well," objected William the Dutchman, "you can't make
bricks without straw."
"Tiens!" cried M. Jacobi, " but you cannot make Opera without
Stbauss!"
William the Dutchman grasped him by the hand. It was an
idea. Stbauss's Merry War by all means; "and," added the emi-
nent but still dismal Shareholder, " if that fails, it's the last Stbauss
that breaks the camel's back. Why not try Planquette?"
"Cher ami!" exclaimed M. Jacobi, affectionately slapping the
despondent Alhambraist on the shoulder, " I ask for Strauss, and as
Signor Alfredo Thompsoni, our colleague at the Pandora, would
say, you throw quite a 'wet Planquette' on it."
"Well, but wet Planquette's a suocess, isn't it?" asked the
Director.
"So so," replied Mr. Reece, who had just looked in ' on the job,'
"I can't say Rip goes Rippingly."
"Wish you couldn't say it," growled the despondent one.
So terms were arranged with Mr. Reece, who said he wouldn't
"split Stbauss " over a pound or two, and he undertook to write the
libretto of the Merry War, But what a weak title! and especially
just now, when the Public are associating war with anything but
merriment.
However, there it is, and we may say, at once, that rarely, if ever,
has the mise-en-scene, specially the scenes, been more effective
than in this Opera. The music is tuneful, but not catching: the
cast is not strong, the story weak, the characters good; but in spite
of all the Strauss melodies, the strength of the piece lies, not like
Samson's in his 'airs, but in the Military Ballet in the Third Act, for
which M. Jacobi has
written music that
makes dancing easy
even where Ballet has
reigned supreme. Mile.
de Labruyere and
Mabie Valain divide
the honours and share
the applause which they
most thoroughly de-
serve. Miss Lizzie Per-
cival, leading her
dashing comrades in
their dancing musketry
drill, would take captive
the most ferocious ene-
my, and evoke a rapturous encore from him into the bargain.
Mr. Bright, himself, could not object to a Merry War carried on
by such troops, and. of course, he would, on the quakerest principles,
admire the Merry War as a Merry Peace.
Could Mr. Bbough, who is playing a dull Dutchman at the
Comedy, have visited Holland—Mr. W. Holland, we mean—and
taken the part of Balthazar, a very lively Dutchman, here, and
could M. Marius have played a character whose catch-line, "I don't

Jacobi making Uricks with plenty of Strauss.
think I ought to have said that," bears a striking resemblance to
his leading question in Les Manleaux Noirs, "Am I going too far?"
the cast of the piece would have been far stronger than it is at
present.
Miss L08EBT is as bright as ever, and Madame Amadi makes a
capital Military Duchess, recalling the Ah, quej'aime les militaires,
as she leads her warrioresses.
Instead of Mile. Lory Stubel, who was associated with the success
of the Merry War abroad, as Elsie, we heard somebody Elsie—and
that somebody was Miss Kate Sullivan, who, considering she took
the part at very short notice, and must have
been horridly nervous, played capitally, sang
well, and looked the character of the Dutch-
man's wife most thoroughly.
Those who do not care to see the entire
Opera should on no account miss the Military
Ballet, with which the Third Act commences,
at ten o'clook.
After the War at the Alhambra we come
to the Piece at the Comedy—which, as we
have said in our title, is lively—on account
of the brightness of the costumes, the pretty
looks of the wearers, the general excellence of
the acting and singing, both too good for the
music and words,—the former being graceful
but commonplace, and the latter only common-
place—and lastly, the scene in the Second Act
in the Katskill Mountains, whioh is a verit-
able chef (Tceuvre of Mr. Beveelet's paint-

ing
Winkle, which Washington Ibving
adapted from the German tale of Peter
Klaus and made his own, has been taken by two Frenchmen and one
North Briton, and, if not absolutely butchered to make a London
holiday, at least, so spoilt for operatic purposes as to cause regret
that the International Librettists, Messrs. Meilhac, Gille, and
Farnie had not cudgelled
their brains to devise an
original story between the
three of them, and have
found for M. Planquette,
the French Composer, some-
thing as congenial to his
talents as was the really
first - rate plot of Les
Cloches de Cornevxlle, of
which the Composer gives
us, in Rip, occasional
reminiscences, but to the
level of which, in his
present effort, he never
once rises.
Rip Van Winkle was a
story worthy of thegenius
of a Meyerbeer, a Webeb,
or a Wagner, could the last
have stuck to his Flying-
Dutchman style. But the International Librettists and their
Composer have frittered away all the picturesque, goblinesque, and
pathetic character of the tale to suit what are supposed to be the
tastes of the Publio frequenting the. Comedy Theatre which goes
in to rival the Gaiety and the
Avenue with its dresses,
Sretty faces, shapely limbs,
ght sparkling music, catchy
tunes, and catch-word dia-
logue. The pathetic simplicity
of the story is entirely des-
troyed, and instead of poor,
careless, sottish Rip being
driven out of his house ana
home by his vixenish wife,
he leaves a loving spouse,
charmingly represented by
Miss Violet Cameeon, and
his child, and goes to seek for
treasure in the Katskill Moun-
tains; where, instead of being
encountered by HeinDriX
Hudson's ghostly crew of
grimy old Dutch Salts play-
ing at bowls, whose thunder
reverberates through the hills,
he assists at an entertainment given by an amiable tenor and a
number of musical young ladies belonging, perhaps, to Miss LrtA
Clay's Company from the Comique; and here also he sees Miss Ada

'Ome, Sweet 'Ome." Bip bringing up
the Children in the way they should
go down a Back Street.

well dramatised by Mr.
Boucicault, and so
marvellously played by
Mr. J. Jeeeebson as
Rip.
Lionel Bbough's
part was, on the first
night, a very stupid one; his one joke, which he shared with Mr.
Leslie, as Rip, being, " Chal-uck it up"—a catch-word which, if
repeated often enough, may stick.

Miss Violet Cameron's sole chance is with the Letter Song
(wasn't there a far superior Letter Song in La Perichole ?) in
the Third Act, which may become popular, though it is not
"oatchy"—indeed, there is so
little for an audience to take
away with them that the
slightest removal of a tune
would endanger the entire
Opera.
Miss Saidi Mabtinot is
pretty and lively, but on the
first night, though probably
improved by now, she could
scaroely be heard beyond the
third row of stalls.
The dialogue is generally dull, occasionally
enlivened by a selection from Joe Miller; as
when the Lawyer wants to be paid by Rip
"for the opinion he had of him the other day,"
and Rip returns that "he never had any opinion
of him"—for which overhaul not only Joe Miller
but Smith's Irish Diamonds, &c, &c. No
doubt the French collaborateurs were delighted
with this jeu de mot when it was explained
to them with the aid of a grammar and
dictionary.
One good thing in the dialogue we record:
"You know what a person ought to do who
lives in a glass-house?" "Yes," is the reply, "pull down the
blinds." This, whether new or old, whether Mr. Fabnle's or Mr.
Anybody Else's, is excellent. But it
stands alone, as does the Letter Song.
Mr. Bbocoh has little to sing, do,
or say, except the already mentioned
phrase "Chal-uck it up," which ap-
plies to Rip's score for drink chalked
up on the tavern shutter; and Rip's
score on the shutter closely resembles
Rip's orchestral score, being of a very
even character throughout. That it
will have a fair run is probable, but
that it will never rival the popularity
of Let Cloches is absolutely certain.
It was reported that M. Plan queue
refused £20,000 for Rip. If it was a
music publisher who made this offer, he
must have been Boosey. But M. Plan-
quette, being a devout man, went to
Chappell, and was able to wire to his friends, "Chappell closed!"

SCHOOL-BOREDOM.
Deab Mb. Punch,
Your Correspondent is mistaken as to the number of
Standards which Candidates for the School-Board will be required
to pass. There are now seven instead of six, and I suppose the
number will be seventeen before the next School-Board Election.
Meanwhile, I send you two.letters, both from Lady Candidates, who
solicit my vote at the ensuing Election. The first is as follows:—
"Deab Sib,
"I beg to inform you that I am desirous of obtaining a seat
in the School-Board at the forthcoming Election, and for the follow-
ing reason :—I wish to see the brutal and barbarous practice of cor-
poral punishment entirely abolished. I desire to see the Board
Schools supplied with sugar-plums instead of birch-rods. 'Hope
springs eternal in the human breast,' &c, and the hope of reward is
a far more powerful incentive to exertion than the base fear of the
rod. Having no children of my own, I can devote my entire atten-
tion to this great question; for I do not hesitate to eay that our
practice of flogging is a national disgrace.
'" I am, dear Sir, Your obedient Servant,
"Tabitha Tantbum."
Another Candidate, Mr. Punch, takes an entirely opposite view
of this vexed question. She writes as follows:—
"I trust, Sir, you will not allow yourself to be led away by the
ridiculous theory lately started that corporal punishment should be
abolished in all Board Schools. I have seen the letter of Miss Tan-
tbum. She says she has no boys of her own, and, I presume, is not
likely to have any. What, then, is her opinion worth Y I am proud
to say that I am the mother of six children, and, I tell her, that
boys will be boys, and that boys that never require a licking are
never good for anything. Abolish flogging, indeed! You might as
well abolish the Ten Commandments, trial by jury, fox-hunting,
cricket, or any other established institution of the country. I
always thought Miss Tantbum was a sensible person until now,
what I think of her now I shall leave you to guess. Hoping for the
honour of your support at the forthcoming election.
"I am, &o. Wilhelmlna Whackum."
Between these rival Candidates, Mr. Punch, I am somewhat
puzzled, but before committing myself to either I shall wait to see
whether they can qualify for a seat in the School Board by passing
the seventh standard. i anl) &0, a Pebpleied Ratepayer.
CONSERVATIVE ORSONS ENDOWED WITH REASON.
If what Lord Cabnabvon has publioly stated is true—or nearly
true—we are within what, in cultured slang, is called "a measurable
distance" of the Millennium. He says that three-fourths of the
literary power of the oountry, and four-fifths of the intellectual
ability, are on the Conservative side. The mere statement of such a
fact, if it is a fact, is enough to send the sternest Radical delirious
with joy. The Conservative Orson is at last endowed with reason.
A political Party which has aoted for centuries as a drag on social
progress—which did all it could to stop the introduction of gas and
railways, which believed in waggons and a four dayB' ride from
London to Manchester, which hated cheap newspapers, and fought
hard for stamp and paper duties, which still has a sneaking kindness
for dear bread, and an outspoken love for dear clothes, dear wine,
and dear land,—is glorying in the possession of nearly all the literary
and intellectual power in England. We will not inquire too closely
into the origin of this power. It may be a divine gift—a sudden
inspiration—or it may be the result of long, earnest, and observant
education. The Conservatives may have followed the example of
their late lamented leader, and have learnt wisdom even from their
enemies. Let us hope that they will use this wisdom for the public
good, and do something in the future that will make us forget the
wretched past. Passive, not to say obstructive, ability is not a
quality likely to meet with general admiration.
What Will You Teck?— At the banquet given to the First
Life Guards by the Knightsbridgians, the Duke of Teck is reported
to have said, in returning thanks for himself, that he had "turned
up in Egypt like a bad shilling, and now trusted that the Army would
regard him as a comrade." Why Y Are the enlisted Queen's shil-
lings all bad ones, that they should regard false coin as a comrade P
Surely, His All Serene Highness did himself an injustice. "We would
not hear his enemy say bo." He went out in the Postal Telegraphic
Service, didn't he?—and was employed as an in-and-out post when
not engaged in keeping his eye on a distinguished Russian visitor.

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Tuesday Night, October 24.—House met again to-day after ten
weeks' holiday. Boys oame baok very well, looking as if they liked
it. Head-master early in his place, with clean collar on, stifter and
larger than ever. Doesn't look as if he had got much out of his
holiday. Habtington looking horribly bored. Chlldebs in high
state of self-content. Chamberlain away ill with the gout.
"Gout I "growls Mr. Hicks, in a stage-whisper, across the Gang-
way, to Sir Walteb Babttelot. "Never heard of a Radical having
the gout. Believe it's only tooth-aohe."
Staftobd Nobthcote looking cheery and rosy as a Devonshire
apple before the wrinkles come. Everybody makes a point of
shaking hands with him. Been remarks by naughty young men who
want to depose him. Everybody anxious to show that he has
nothing to do with conspiracy. So shakes hands with Sir Stafford,
who holds a levee something like Speakeb on last day of Session.
Below the Gangway, a thin black streak of Irish Members. Mr.
Hbaly at the head, Mr. Pabnell at the tail, and Joseph Gnxis in
the middle. Sitting turns out a little tame; but, yesterday, Joseph
presided at a Meeting where Landlordism was denounced. Reool-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

lection of this cheers him, and is accountable for the pleased smile
with whioh he surveys the House.
Randolph back again; takes earliest opportunity of advertising
fact. Speaker scarcely in Chair, when Randolph on his legs.
Two new Members waiting to be sworn in. Randolph bubbling
on behalf of an outraged Constitution. Cannot wait till they take
the oath. Jumps up whilst Mr. Craig Sell a r is walking to the
Table. Mr. Bbadlaugh, under the Gallery, pricks up his ears. Is
Randolph going to object to a good Scotchman taking the oath?
No; it's the Constitution that Randolph is concerned for. His own
being repaired, has now time to think of the country's.
Enormous' excitement among the Fourth Party. Big Ben having
suddenly stirred within his bosom curiosity as to " What you are
going to do with the Reserves?" comes down early and steers for his
old place, the corner seat front bench below the Gangway. Finds a
younger craft already moored at his anchorage. Bears up alongside.
Presently comes Sir Henry Wolff and brings up alongside the old
hulk. Lieutenant and Captain excitedly consult across his bows,
till B. B. can stand it no longer.
"Where's your Reserve? he
growls, and chuckling at his
own joke, claps on sail, slowly
forges ahead, and so out over
the bar. Thus were the in-
terests of the Navy sacrificed,
and the great question B. B.
has been propounding for forty
years again postponed.
Gladstone made fine play
with Randolph, House
mightily enjoying the diver-
lion. Growing excitement
among the Fourth Party.
I ircmmos i) constantly running
out and coming back with fresh
leaves from the library—
£j,ml —~--w.Kss^.-ea"-." , "Noah'sdovenothingtohim,"
■* 'SSsisiW^ra^^*?*-'^ *"" as Mr. HeaLT observes. Mr.
Grand Old Giant giving the Sprightly Goest looks increasingly wise,
Young Midget a hearty welcome on whilst Mr. iJALFOUR stretches
hi» return to the House. his legs further and further
across the floor, till they look
more than ever like notes of exclamation.
Little farce took two hours to play: then real business commenced.
Got through with surprising smoothness. Gladstonb forestalled
Irish row by moving for Committee to inquire why Mr. Gray was
imprisoned. Result deeply interesting to Mr. Out since his im-
prisonment is now over. Mr. Chaplin made a magnificently eloquent
speech against Resolution giving precedence to procedure, at which
rude Radicals laughed.
Sir Walter Bakttelot intimated his intention to die on floor of
the House in resistance to the First Resolution. As anybody desirous
of laying a hand on Mrs. Dawson must stride over the dead body of
the Lord Mayor of Dublin, so Cloture can pass as a Standing Order
only over the corse of Sir Walteb Bahttelot.
After this nothing more to be said. Resolution passed, and House
adjourned at a decent hour.
Thursday, Home of Lords.—Very good House to-day, considering
it's foggy, and no Noble Lord, either when raised to the Peerage or
when born into it, contemplated an Autumn Session. Was not in
the contract, and Lord Den man, to whom a case has been submitted,
gives the opinion that attendance is only an act of grace.
Lord Bbaboubne more than ever disturbed in mind. Earlier in
the Session confided to sympathising House that if, when Mr. Glad-
stone conferred Peerage upon him, he had known that the new Irish
Land Act was in his mind, would have declined the honour. Lord
Shebbbook says there is little confusion of terms here. A thing can
hardly be said to be "conferred" when a man has been pestered into
giving it. But that is the worst of these young Peers. So jealous
of each other.
Bbaboubne now says, if he had known of an Autumn Session,
would not have accepted Peerage. "Glad he didn't know," says
Sir William Hakcoubt, who still sits in the Commons. In pertur-
bation of mind, his distraught Lordship boldly takes his seat on
Conservative Benches.
"My dear Bbaboubne," says Lord Rosebery, who, as he some-
times lives in Scotland, no one suspects of joking, "have you
seriously considered this step P Whilst you sat on the Cross
Benches, you were ready to take advantage of anything that turned
up. Might have got a lift from either side upon occasion. Now,
you know, you have thrown your chances away. I ou 've lost anything
more that might be got out of the Liberals, and are not sure of
getting anything out of the Conservatives."
"All right, Rosebery, my boy," said B., putting a lordly
forefinger parallel with a baronial nose, and winking a contingent
visoountly eye, "trust me for knowing what I am doing. Don't you
see the Session's short, and not quite in a regular way'( Don't
commit myself by anything I do now. If I find I have made a mis-
take, can quietly go back to Cross Benches next February, and
return to the look-out. If things are promising, here shall stay."
Rather surprised to find Lord Salisbury up again.
"Thought you were having a good time down at Hatfield, dancing
'Sir Roger de Coverlet/,' rollicking in the placid joys of Blind-man's
Buff, making yourself ill with boar's-head, and otherwise playing the
Fine Old English Gentleman."
"So I was, Toby," his Lordship said, with a yawn, "and glad I
am to get out of it. Bored to death. Cranbourne 's a nice boy—
perhaps a little quiet. But I do hope he will never come of age
again in my lifetime."
My Lord Marquis found some compensation in sparring with Lord
Granville, and thoroughly enjoyed himself. Gbanvillb delightful
with his genial smile, his rapid fence, and his graceful thrust,
whioh, however, sometimes draws blood.
House of Commons.—History repeats itself, or so I fancy I have
heard it said, or seen it written. To-night presented remarkable ex-
ample. _ A little difficult to hit upon authorised description of recent
proceedings in Egypt. Mr. Gladstone a short time ago protested it
was not a war. To-night in a vote of thanks it is called a " military
rebellion." Irish Members, who ought to know, demur to this
description. Whatever it may have been, to-night we have had in
the House of Commons a very precise reproduction, barring, of course,
bombardment and bloodshed. Arabi Randolph Churchill, rising
from below the Gangway, has moved Amendment to First Resolution
of Procedure. His Highness Stafford Tewfik Northcote has
risen from his throne above the Gangway, and opposed the Amend-
ment, which, he says, would be confusing. In a well-regulated
State Tewfik's word would be law, and nis Lieutenant, Arabi,
would, with profound salaam, obey. But Opposition not in well
ordered state just now. Arabi tugs at inadequate moustachio, and
frowns upon Tewfik. Ali-Stanlby-Fehmy Leiohton (sometime
known as " The Man from Shropshire ") beards Tewfik, and declares
for Arabi. _
Arabi hoists the flag of rebellion, and determines to divide. Con-
sternation in the Palace. Tewfik thrusts his hands up his coat-
sleeves, bends his head, and leaves everything in the hands of Allah.
Lord John Man-
ners, with the
vigour of youth,
jumps up and
flees. Tewfik
moves_ uneasily
on his throne.
Begins to think
Cairo too hot for
him, and retreats
to Alexandria,
which is no fur-
ther than his
room in the cor-
ridor. Sir Rich-
ard Cross hesi-
tates, and is of
course lost —that
is, he finds his
way out — amid
mocking oheers
from the Liberals,
manly bosom is torn

Muzzling the Sphinx.
Between Arabi and Tewfik W. H. Smith's
If he goes and Arabi triumphs he will be
bowstrung: if he stops and Tewfik comes back he will be put in a
sack and dropped over Waterloo Bridge. Whilst wondering what
he shall do, opportunity of choice gone. Question is put. He must
vote, and perforce throws in his lot with Arabi.
Very funny scene, especially for those who are not Conservatives.
"Reminds me," says Sir Chablxs Fobster, "of that beautiful
poem of Sir Walter Scott. How does it begin—The first to go was
little Jane,—No :—
The first to go was little John,
Apt often for the fray,
But now he takes his hat and gloves,
And then he goes away.
Sir Stafford meekly looks around—
(He 'J put hi* glasses on)
And then unto himself he says,
"I think I '11 follow John.'1
Business done.—Tote of Thanks to Soldiers and Sailors passed in
both Houses.
Friday Right.—Still harping on First Resolution. All the talking
left to the Tories. Find it's not so easy as it looks when Irish
Members are at it. An hour of Arthur O'Connor, or even twenty
minutes of T. P. would be gratefully accepted. Tewfik, who has
come back again as if nothing particular happened yesterday, wilily
gets a speech out of Dillwyn. But that doesn't go far.
Business done.—Talk.

OUR HEROES AT HOME.
"And oh, by the bte, mt Son tells hi you don't make bis SHIRT-
COLLARS STIFF ENOUGH. He '8 IN TUB GUARDS, TO? KNOW, AND THEY 00 IN
FOR BRING VERY PARTICULAR 1"
"Well, Ma'am, all I can sat is, I 'vk oot a Son in the Guards irr-
SELF, AND I ALLKHS WASHES FOR 'ill WHEN HE COMES 'OME, AND HS DON'T
MAKE NO COMPLAINTS!"
ADVICE TO STREPHON.
Perhaps the most dire, insurmountable bar
To youth who will worship a popular star,
To his appetite's rapid reduction,
Is, though one's intentions be perfectly pure,
One can't, at eighteen, in a moment secure
An eligible introduction.
Tour wholly inedited love's novel force,
If you could express it, would strike her, of course,
She must fall to your spirit's near wailing1;
But it's hard to exhibit one's pathos or wit
From a haphazard row in a two-shilling pit,
Or a perch on a common park-railing.
But here is a remedy ready and ripe
For Stbbfhons of Tittleback Titmouse's type :—
Instead of exhaling vain vapours;
Instead of pursuing and pestering all
Your friends for a four-hundredth card to her ball,
Just study the day's morning papers.
You hung o'er her hands in your juvenile hope,
You '11 know them now, even right down to the soap—
Brown's Patent—which saves them from blisters;
Her hair I—how your rash fancy caught at each curl!—
She deigns to inform you, the generous girl,
That they 're twisted by Smith's Patent Twisters.
The dark darling depths of her toilet once seemed
Sacred things that a venturesome demigod dreamed,
How they charmed a mere lad who could see a
Divinity in every beauty that floats
To Court, let him hear of her proud petticoats,—
Jones's Starch does the paiuit dea.
And that loved lovely face limned in your lover's heart,
You need no more depend on photographer's art
For a portrait—less faithful, but faster;
There isn't a journal of note that don't place,
Life-size, at its back her delectable face,
With her views on the theme of court-plaster.
And a young swain may know all his idols, their tastes
In the matter of curls, and the manner of waists,
As to cocoa, and crinoline cages,
May find that the " Bloom of Albania's" their bloom.
Their pets as to pug, prince, pursuit, and perfume,
If he reads the advertisement pages.

THE MODEST OTHELLO.
(Our latest Modern Drawing-room Edition.)
"Wherein I spake of moat disastrous chances,
Of moving accidents by flood and field,
Of hairbreadth acapea i' the imminent deadly breaoh."
Othello. I think we got through that pretty well.
Detdemona. We didn't make any flaring mistakes. But ought
we to take very high credit to ourselves for having walked through
a quadrille?
Othello. Certainly, as nobody else is likely to give us any.
Besides, I never thought I should stay the course with my lameness.
I have at least every reason to be proud.
Desdemona. I noticed you walked very lame. Have you met with
any acoident P Was it serious P
Othello. Serious P Well, the Doctor Johnnies said I should never
stand another preparation, but I feel all right now.
Detdemona. Was it an aooident, then P Was it out hunting or
shooting P
Othello. In a way, both.
Detdemona. What, foxes one day and pheasants another P
Othello. I wish it had been. It was all on the one day, and what
we hunted and what we shot were Egyptians.
Desdemona. Then you are a soldier P
Othello. For my sins.
Desdemona. And have been in Egypt P
Othello. For my—what shall I say worse than sins ?—my bad luck.
Desdemona. How wonderful! So you have been in Egypt P It
must have been very terrible.
Othello. It was. We had nothing to drink for thirty-six hours.
Desdemona. And the swarthy, savage Egyptians must have looked
terrific?
Othello. They did,—terrifically dirty.
Desdemona. You are the first of our heroes I have seen. So you
must forgive my curiosity. Where were you wounded P
Othello. In the legat Tel-el-Kebir.
Desdemona. At Tel-el-Kebir I And did you charge at the
trenches P
Othello. Well, everybody seemed to be going the same way, and
I went, too.
Desdemona. And what did you think of as you engaged in this
magnificent charge P
Othello. What they would say if I stuck my toes in the ground,
and cut it.
Desdemona. Cut—your toes or the ground?
Othello. Eh? No, you don't quite understand. I mean if I ran
away.
Desdemona. Of course you never thought of that. You weren't
frightened.
Othello. Wasn't I P I haven't been in suoh a blue funk since the
day when I first put the gloves on with Ned Donellt.
Desdemona. Is he an Egyptian P
Othello. No, I never heard so. I think he's Irish.
Detdemona. Nearly all the Egyptians seem to be some other
nation. They say that Arahi Pasha is a Spaniard. What is he
like P How often did you see him P
Othello. Never. You had to look very nippy to see him. As soon
as anything went wrong—that is to say, as soon as we got near him,
—he offed it by the special.
Detdemona. So you never saw him P What were the officers like P
Othello. Well, you know, we didn't see much of them. Tel-el-
Kebir reminded me of Croydon in the old days, when all the Welshers
used to bolt before the last race to catch the next train back to
Town. These Egyptian officers did a guy just like them, and in
their long great-coats looked just like them.

startling development of the new
Art of Scientific Shindy might be
suggested to "the Master" by
such a theme as " The Saving of

Detdemona. Then who fought against you? Who wounded you':
Othello. Oh, the men. They were capital chaps,—stood up and
got shot like bricks. The Johnny who potted me was only two
yards off.
Detdemona. Did you fall on him P
Othello. I fell, but not on him. I fell on my own face.
Detdemona. Then ho escaped P
Othello. No. A sportsman behind me shoved his bayonet in him.
Detdemona. Then he was killed P
Othello. Well—he didn't seem to be going strong at the finish.
Detdemona. Did you really kill enemies yourself f
Othello. Couldn't help it. If I hadn't killed them, it was about
six to four they 'd have killed me.
Detdemona. Dreadful I How delighted you must have been to
get back to London!
Othello. One is always delighted to get back to the Tillage.
Detdemona. Of course your family were awfully proud of you on
your return P
Othello. I don't run to a family; I only keep a father.
Detdemona, His joy must have been the greater, then, at wel-
coming home an only child!
Othello. I dare say it really was; but the old boy has been
soldiering himself, and doesn't think the present lot of Generals
within 21 lbs. of a really good one. He is under the idea that if Sir
Garnet had had really the interests of his men at heart, he would
have kept them in Egypt till after the Houghton. And, mind you,
the old boy is about right as far as I am concerned; for whether it
was the heavy going, or whether it was the postponement, I backed
about a hundred and fifty horses for the Cambridgeshire, and didn't
get in the first three.
Detdemona. Oh, that is the horse-racing at Newmarket you are
talking about. But to return to this dreadful war. Did you, when
you came back home, find many alterations, many changes, in those
you had left behind P
Othello. Rather. Little Connie Gilchrist isn't playing at the
Gaiety. Arthur Roberts, you know, isn't at the Pavilion, and
the Sisters Leavar have left the Royal.
Detdemona. Do you know, by the bye, that all the time we 've
been talking I have not known your name. One always hears one's
own in an introduction, and that's all.
Othello. I am generally called Bill, but I was christened Alger-
non Fitzrot Plantagenet Crowndale.
Detdemona. Oh! Why I read of you, and of the great brave
thing you did at Tel-el-Kebir, in savin g the life of a wounded
private. I read about your arrival at Portsmouth. Weren't you
proud to read how the papers spoke of you P
Othello. Well, perhaps I should have been if I had been the only
Johnny able to read; but unfortunately they over-educate the Jews,
and there was a regular army of written to meet me.
Detdemona. But what are writters?
Othello, Why, sportsmen with writs.
Detdemona. I don't know what writs are.
Othello. You must lead a very sad and lonely life.
Detdemona. Why?
Othello. Well, you can't have a father or any brothers, or

THE FOOD EXHIBITION.
"We believe that up to the time of our going to press no applica-
tions for vacant spaces wherein to show the following articles of food
have been made, or, at any rate, have been granted :—
Poisonous fungi, which, owing to the strong resemblance which
they bear to the edible mushroom, can be sold as such.
Decayed carrots, watery turnips, and rotten potatoes, which, with
the disguising aid of sugar, colouring-matter, and a small quantity
of real fruit, can be converted into strawberry or raspberry jam,
according to the customers' tastes, at a very slight cost.
American beef, which, with a little skilful trimming, can he altered
into English beef at a profit of some 200 per cent.
Alum, as employed in the manufacture of "pure wholesome
wheaten bread.
London water as filtered for the Public. The rights of fishing for
animalcules in these waters are strictly preserved by the Water
Companies.
Putrid meat, before being highly seasoned and spiced and dis-
guised in the form of fresh Cambridge Sausages.
The homely Pilchard as he is, and as he appears as the Sardine of
the Mediterranean.
Not Generally Known.
That the iEsthetic Movement is nothing but an enormous scheme
of a commercial Company to advertise the capabilities of the Sun-
flower, that a large manufactory is beingerected for its development
in Bedford Park, and that Mr. Oscar Wilde is now travelling in
America with samples of Sunflower Soap, Sunflower Oil, Sunflower
Silk, and Sunflower Cattle-Food.
ONE LAW FOR THE RICH—
Eaton Square.—The Duke of Bloomsbuby applied to-day for a
summons against the Rev. Whyte Chokerly, on the grounds that
the Defendant had grossly assaulted Plaintiff's son, the Marquis of
Torrinoton. His Grace said that early in the present year he had
placed his son, a delioate boy of ten years of age, with the De-
fendant, who had been recommended to him as a humane man,
especially skilled in "coaching" backward boys, such as his son,
who through ill-health, undoubtedly was. Finding that the lad
seemed timid and nervous, he questioned him, and learnt that he
was frequently flogged three or four times a week, and sometimes
every day. He had been so severely thrashed the day before, and
his body was so covered with weals, that his father thought it was
only his duty to apply for this summons.—The learned Magistrate
said that in his opinion boys were all the better for a sound
flogging. He knew he had been thrashed enough when he was at
school, and had no doubt his Grace had shared a similar fate. He
Bhould grant no summons, and felt bound to state that he was asto-
nished at a person of the Duke of Bloomsbury's experience wasting
the valuable time of the Court over such a trumpery matter.
-AND ANOTHER FOR THE POOR.
Whitechapel.—Mr. Henry Teauchamp, an Assistant-Master at
the Moriarty Court School of the Whitechapel School-Board, was
this day charged, on a summons, with assaulting William Crack
Crib, a pupil at the school. The Complainant, a sturdy lad of
fifteen, deposed that on the 27th he was oalled out from his place in
the school, and severely beaten, his alleged offence being talking to
the boy who sat next to him. His body was still covered with
bruises, and he was so ill the following day that he wasn't able to
go to church.—On behalf of the Defendant several witnesses deposed
that the school in question contained as unruly and troublesome a
lot of boys as were to be found in London; that the Plaintiff was of
notoriously bad character, and was one of a gang of young thieves
known as the " Terrors of the Neighbourhood ;" that his talking to
the boy next to him was in reality using, at the top of his voice,
most foul and disgusting language; and that the " severe beating"
was a slight caning over the hand with a light wooden paper-knife.—
The Defendant was fined 40». and costs, at which decision he seemed
thunderstruck, and hastily ejaculated that such a sentence meant
his dismissal from his post, and consequent ruin.—The learned
Magistrate said he ought to have thought of that before ill-treating
his pupil, a lad who, if well and kindly used, would doubtless become
an honour to his country. He was perfectly satisfied that the De-
fendant was a man of ungovernable temper, and wanted a sharp
lesson to teaoh him that the children of the poor and humble 'were

THE PLEASURES AND PAINS OF HAMPSTEAD HEATH.
PITY THE POOR SHERIFFS!
Now, Mr. Bull, that the parties liable to Berve as High Sheriffs
are about being named, perhaps you may ask why, when nominated
for the High Shrievalty, they are said to be pricked?
Answer:—Because pricking them means sticking it into them, as
it were, and making them bleed—and hurting them. Yes, Sir, bleed
to the amonnt of from £500 to £600. This in many cases is bleeding
them ad deliquium, as the Doctors used to prescribe in the good old
days of venesection. To fainting, Sir.
The puncture for High Sheriff was a mere fleabite formerly, when
Landowners, as a class, were " Bloated Aristocrat*." But now, what
with rents reduced almost all round, or else not paid at all, they may
remain aristocratic, but they are attenuated.
What should we hear said on platforms at public meetings if
reverend Dissenting Ministers and respectable Shopkeepers were
subject to be stuok into, and bled, and put upon like Landowners?
And, mind you, your High Sheriff has nothing personally to do
whatever except to sit at the Assizes beside the Judge in a droll and
uncomfortable costume, almost as uncomfortable and as droll as my
Lud's, and to escort their Ludships to and from their lodgings in a
state-coach. He is not permitted to have them wheeled in 'peram-
bulators, and, even if he offered to send them in a cab, would get
himself committed for contempt.
He pays the Under Sheriff to perform the real duties of his office.
Couldn't an Under Sheriff, always "One, &c," detach a clerk or
some other sufficiently gentlemanlike and well-behaved young man
to attend my Luds? And shouldn't the Under Sheriff be paid out
of the county rates, instead of his poor superior's pocket?
Landowners, to be sure, mostly aspirate their h's, and own armorial
bearings which they have really inherited; but surely not even the
most outrageous anti-Gentleman will assign those things as reasons
why they should be liable to have it stuck into them, and be bled, more
than many other people very much better able to bear it. Even if
they were, as some of their inveterate enemies object, "orty," would
it be fair to fine them heavily for mere ortiness?—the poor beggars!
Perhaps, Mr. Bull, ruinous appointments have been, by this time,
improved away in Siam; but if not, now isn't the office of High
Sheriff about our nearest equivalent to a White Elephant? A very
useless office, but how very much the reverse of a sinecure!
KNIGHT THOUGHTS (ON THE NINTH).

Come to my Civic birthright! Staples,
Nottage,
I wouldn't sell it for a mess of pottage.
Gold chains and gorgeous garb! De Ket-
skb, Savobt,
'Tis rather nice this glittering civic bravery.
The point of the procession! Chambers,
Ciiablev,
With Fame's fair proffer one were fool to
parley.
Choked streets and clamorous shoutings!
Monckton, Nelson,
This is a scene that memory fondly dwells on.
Some folks pooh-pooh processions. Gabriel, La whence,
Can't say that pageantry is my abhorrence.
The cynosure of thousands! Truscott, Owden,
Is't not a thing a man may well be proud on?
How the boys shout! McAbtiujr, Hanson, Fowler,
I feel a fondness for each urchin howler.
This something my great-grandchildren to tell is.
Really, most pleasant! How do you feel, Ellis?
Well, when my fleeting year hath taken flight,
May all—and in two senses—say good Knight!

A Knight-Mare.
Sunday in Somerset.—An agitation in the county of Somerset
for the purpose of obtaining a Sunday Closing Bill, to add to the
agreeableness of that day in that shire, is being fomented under the

DOWN PARNASSUS.
That the Laureate has been doing his very best to fit himself for
his great forthcoming dramatio effort in everyday prose, may be
gathered from the following unrhythmical version of one of his own
well-known poems, recently picked up in pencil, on a fly-leaf, at the
stage-door of the Globe Theatre. There is perhaps a little too muoh
redundancy of expression observable; but the determined effort to
get rid of poetic form at any cost, is highly praiseworthy, and augurs
well for the distinguished Author's latest venture.
In addressing you, I admit, somewhat inooherently, 0 Sea, I must
most emphatically reiterate my request that you will not only break
upon what are vaguely termed "your oold grey crags," but even, if
possible, splash up on to the very Marine Parade; and must add,
while preferring'this simple request, that I most heartily wish I could
in the least convey, in any intelligible language, what on earth it
is 1 'm thinking about.
It is extremely fortunate for the Fisherman's Boy that, while
engaged in athletio recreation with his sister, he finds his lungs in
more than average condition 1 _ It is also a matter of real congratu-
lation to the Nautical-Yachting Young Man, that, whatever appa-
rently may be the state of the weather in the Bay, he finds himself,
when once on board, equal to a song I
And what is really a remarkable bit of seamanship, the vessels in
the immediate neighbourhood, vessels, too, apparently well conducted
and officered with some dignity, somehow or other blunder away, and,
very possibly to escape pier-dues, manage to come up alongside—I
should say a great deal too olose in— right under• the hill! But not-
withstanding the peculiarity of this artful marine manoeuvre, I am
still anxious to play a game at blind-man's buff conducted without
noise on the new and approved Silent System rules.
And so, once more, 0 Sea, please break upon the crags I have
already referred to. At the same time, I may mention in con-
fidence, the anything-bnt-tough experiences of an agreeable season,
which I feel it' is morally impossible to resuscitate, 1 must, like a
sensible man, regard henceforth as fairly and hopelessly wiped out.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FKOH
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

THE NEW RULES OF PROCEDURE PRIZE PUZZLE; OR, HOW TO FIT IN THE SPEAKER.
House of Commons, Monday Night, October 30.—More than ever
impressed with the business capacity of House. Spent two hours
and a half to-night on thrilling discussion as to whether the Closure
Question should be put by the Speaker or by a Minister of the
Crown. Had a dim fanoy that had heard something of this before.
Possibly in some previous state of existence. Still, so entrancingly
interesting that no one could grudge repetition, and would look
forward with satisfaction to expectation of renewal away in the
ewigkeit.
At the end of two hours and a half, Stafford Northcote made
surprising and pleasing discovery that in May last a similar Resolu-
tion been before the House, and debated at great length. The
Speaker admitted the fact, but ruled that since the terms were
enlarged, the Motion was not out of order.
Glad to hear this. Shall tack on another half-yard, and we '11
have it all over again next week.
Whilst away in the dining-room, drawing up terms of my
Amendment, Captain Aylmer moved to restrict speeches to ten
minutes' duration. Captain a little mixed as to where his Amend-
ment to come in. Got, as it were, between the legs of the First
Resolution. Apart from this little maladroitness, gallant Captain
has hit the bull's-eye. What we want is shorter speeches. Ten
minutes won't do, but twenty would admirably. Remember late
Mr. Disraeli saying to me, "Take my word for it, Toby, there's no
man in the world, except Mr. Gladstone, who cannot Bay everything
he has to say, and say it at his best, in twenty minutes."
Exception to disadvantage of Wio, a little spiteful. "Ver-
bosity," as Mr. Thomasson says, "is like drink. It grows upon a
man. Just as one begins with a nip a day, and goes on to nineteen,
so some men begin with short speeches, and go on to windy
orations."
But Weo can, and he will, make telling speeches within limits of
twenty minutes. See how, last week, he, in a single sentence,
showed absurd impracticability of Randolph's Amendment about
Chairman of Committees consulting Speaker before putting Closure
question. Pity of it is Gladstone won't. His example most per-
nicious. Debauches ingenuous minds like those of Joseph Gillis,
and once led him to make a speech fully four hours long.
Business done.—Members in remarks varying from twenty
minutes to three-quarters-of-an-hour, urged the primal necessity of
strictly limiting the duration of speeches.
Tuesday Night.—Grand Old Man made grand old speech. Didn't
think it possible for any one to impart life into dulness of
debate. Gibson tried. Uplifted his voice, and moved Alderman
Fowler and Mr. Warton to tears by reference to "this grand old
House of Commons of ours." General effeot little pulpy. Such a
speech as might have been made from a brief. Weg, on the con-
trary, was mightily in earnest, glowing with eloquence, and took the
House by Btorm.
"What's matterP" said Cavendish Bentinck, wobbling in
with that remarkable stride, which suggests that his left leg wants
to carry him over to the Liberal majority, whilst his right is true
to the principles of the Constitution. "What's matter? Has
G. 0. M. disestablished another Church?"
Well might the uproarious cheers recall greater debates.
"It is gratitude makes them sojubilant," said Hicks-Beach, in his
genial way. "They weren't sure after what Gladstone said last
Tuesday, whether he was going to stand by First Resolution or
not. Now they know it, their minds relieved from great weight.
When a Party's got a Leader, it likes to be led."
He was talking to W. H. Smith and quite sorry that Stafford
should have overheard him. "Michael-and-all-Angels" Mr. James
Lowther calls him, in reference to angelic sweetness of his
temper.
After Mr. Gladstone's speech, House emptied. .Members posi-
tively declined to hear any more. Thereby missed a good deal of
soothing eloquence. Amongst others Mr. Whitley was put up by
Mr. Warton, and smiled, with unvarying sweetness upon the
Opposition, as he showed them how hopelessly they were in the
wrong. Mr. Warton had been carefully priming him all night.
Rations of snuff served out regardless of expense. On the whole,
result not quite commensurate with preparations. If Whitley has

a fault, he's a little bit too mild. Mr. Warton goaded him, as it
were, with cheers, and in the excitement of the moment took more
snuff than was good for him. Mr. Whitley had also observed pre-
caution of placing himself immediately before his leader. Relying
upon this moral support, and assisted by the material support of the
Bench, he got advantageous start, but could not make the running.
"I wonder," said Sir Charles Forster, one of his few hearers,
"that a man who calls himself the Universal Provider could not
provide himself with a better speech."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Very odd how the good Baronet mixes up people and
things. But the strain on his mind is enormous. Highest
Authority in the House, who is sometimes startled hy
finding Sir Charles forlornly wandering about distant
corridors, suggested he might wear a cloth-cap which
he could put in his pocket. But Sir Charles says he is
sure he 'd put it in somebody else's, and it would come to
the same thing. "No," he says, with a far-away look in
his eye. "Man and boy, I 've been looking for my hat
for thirty years, and I '11 go on—I '11 go on."
Business done.—Mr. Gibson's Amendment moved.
Wednesday.—Most affecting scene in the House to-
day. Lord Randolph came out in new character.
Hitherto has found the Present and the Past sufficient
for the searchings of his great mind. Now takes the
Future under his wing, and comes out as a Seer.
Solemnly warns Conservative Party of what is in Btore
for them. They will curse the day on which they were
betrayed. "Aye," says Lord Randolph, raising a pro-
phetic hand, and bending a glowering glance on the
shrinking form of Sir Stafford, "and the Leader who
betrayed them!" ...
Drummond Wolff, who has a proper pride in his
Leader, says, "Reminds me of the warning given to
Lochiel before the fatal day: 'Lochikl, Lochiel,
beware of the day, When the Lowlands shall meet thee
in battle array !' and that sort of thing, doncha know?"
Drummond says with glistening eye and heightened
colour.
Certainly is something in that style, though don t
remember myself ever to have seen a Seer with his hair
parted in the middle, carefully oiled, and brought to in
little bows at the forehead. As far as hair goes, Caven-
dish Bentinck or Mr. Forster would do the Seer better.
Also, Randolph might learn a lesson from Mr. Chaplin
when arranging his features on these occasions, and in
manipulating his voice. The troubled brow, the drooped
lips, the humid eye of Mr. Chaplin, combined with low
and solemn tones tremulous with suppressed emotion,
are recommended to Randolph's attention next time
he comes out as a prophet. Also, he really must rumple
his hair.
Business done.—Conservative Party Warned.
Thursday.— More speeches to-night, though everyone
admits the thing is thrashed out.
"Wish the Speakers were, too," says Lord Richard
Grosvenor, with yawn as long as list of Amendments
to First Resolution. "What .do people want making
speeches? Quite enough for a man to vote."
One thing to be said is that if Members' will speak,
others won't listen. House empty all night till eleven
o'clock. Then Clans gather, Members turn up from
various places, far and near, Northcote makes gentle
little jokes of astronomical order, at which the House
genially laugh. Hartington makes strong straight
speech which would have been straighter and stronger
had it been shorter. Everything that can be said has
been said. Marquis observes. What use is unlimited
prolixity in debate? Excellent idea, only might have
been expressed in less than forty minutes.
When Hartington sits down, Mr. Callan gracefully
rises, and is impartially howled at. Old joke this, to
wait till Leaders have wound up debate, and then ap-
pear. Riles the House, and temporarily makes you
personage of importance. Difficult to say which side
Mr. Callan declares for. Is very distinctly heard to
denounce "this coercible Government." After which
he sinks back gently, but firmly, on the crown of his
hat, which is coerced into flattened shape.
Business done.—Mr. Gibson's Amendment rejected by
322 votes against 238.
Friday.—House nearly empty all night. Neverthe-
less, speeches made on various subjects more or less
nearly connected with Amendment before House. Irish
Members show signs of waking up.
Business done.—None.
Rival Nostrums.

DIARY OF A SABBATARIAN A LA MODE DE LONDRES.
Sunday, October 29.—Went to church, and found the choir very imperfeot.
Made a note to write to the Rector about a new tenor that I heard at a pro-
prietary chapel. .
Went to the Fogey Club and had lunch. Had occasion to complain of the
quality of the claret. Wrote several letters to the Daily Waterbutt in favour
of strict Sabbath observance—the closing of public-houses, the stoppage of
bands in the Park, the cessation of railway, postal, and telegraph service, &o.
Read the money article in the Observer, and wrote to my Banker to buy
Egyptians, Turks, and other Infidel Stocks at present low quotations. Wrote
to my Member of Parliament to vote against the admission of Mr. Bradlaugh,
on pain of losing my vote and interest at the next election.
Dined at home, because the Sunday dinners at the Fogey Club are really too
unbearable. Dressed, and went to an evening party at Baron Midas's. Several
royal personages were present, and, in their company, I enjoyed a very clever
performance by Madame Camembert, the French Actress, and her Company.
Fancy I heard somebody say that the piece had been refused a public licence.
Glad that we have officials who know their duty, and do it. One was Pr«ent
at this party. Found a difficulty in getting a cab when I left the house. Made
a note to complain to the Home Office of the disgraceful way in which the pubho
are neglected by Cabmen.
An Echo of the Week.
A Reuter's telegram in the Daily Telegraph on Friday, from Alexandria,
says:—
"Sala Pasha, during hia Bhort stay here, has formed five companies of police of
110 men each."
And all this time he is writing books, inditing columns of gossip for the
Illustrated News, countless leaders for the Daily Telegraph, taking the chair
at dinners and Societies, soampering about the world generally, and going to
see every new piece at the theatre. They may well call him " the versatile
and ubiquitous."

And / am no novice inane.
DuFFEH-nr is his name,
But 1 'm bound to deny,
In regard to the same,
What that name might imply.
Though his smile is so pleasant and. placid,
A Sheitan there lurks in each eye.

Where we played, and you 'd guess
That the Giaour (jot it hot—

Yet he played it on me, did that Giaour,
In a way that was loathsome—no leBs.
We sat down to the game,

I felt sure that the same
He could not understand;
But he smiled as he Eat at the table
With the smile that was placid and bland.
My cards were well stocked,—
As no doubt you '11 believe,—
And I felt—don't be shocked!—
I 'd " a bit up my sleeve."
For when playing with sons of burnt fathers
Our duty's to dupe and deceive.
But the hands whioh were played
By that dog Duffer-in,
And the tricks that he made,
Were a shame, and a sin,
Till at last I was " bested" completely,
And the Giaour scored a palpable win.
Then I felt that my guile
Was but simple and slight,
And he rose, with a smile,
And he said, " That's all rigM!
Think I '11 take the next turn with dear

And he started for Cairo that night.

But, my Tewfik, beware!

Yet he '11 probably give you a hiding,—
Few games that he '11 not understand.

OUT OF PLACE.
The person who declined to contribute
to a fund—say for presenting a golden
warming-pan to Mr. Gladstone—would
hardly be looked upon as ungracious. He
would decline, not, probably, as grudging
a tribute to the Premier, but on the
grounds that the fitness of things was
violated by the form of the proposed
offering. The pure and pleasing American
poet, whose loss all English - speaking
Eeople lament, is worthy of all suitable
ononr. It is because admitting an Ameri-
can Singer to a place so specially set apart
for English celebrities as Westminster
Abbey does not appear to Mr. Punch to be
a suitable honour, that he feels little sym-
pathy with the proposal for placing a bust
of Longfellow in Poet's Corner. Let
genial Earl Granville, and the well-
meaning Committee devise a memorial to
the honoured Author of Hiawatha, which
Bhall enable us to give free and glad play
to our sympathy with genius, and with
our American kinsmen, without feeling
that the grace of the tribute is marred by
its singular inappropriateness.

Our Johnny Lecturing on Art.
"BOYS AND GIBLS;" OB, A PIECE WITH HONOB.
Mr. Pinero, who, when he brought out The Squire, explained
that he wished, to "bring the scent of the hay across the foot-
lights," must be careful how he uses what seems likely to become
his stack-in-trade. Already there is a musty smell about his hay,
and the conventional countryman soon becomes a mere bore,
especially when he finds
himself in company with
such very unconventional
persons as a testy, gouty
old guardian, an adopted
son who incurs his
"guardy's" wrath by fall-
ing in love with a young
person who, strange to say,
is actually beneath him in
station, and all these ap-
pearing in such perfectly
unconventional situations
as that of a young man
preferring _ beggary to
obeying his guardian in
an affair of the heart,
going out into the world
to seek his fortune, after
taking his guardian's
curse, and the unconven-
tional situation of his
return on the very day of
the young person's marriage with somebody else, when his arrival
upsets all the arrangements, and the obdurate "Old hunks" (our
venerable friend of many a Farce and Melodrama) relents, chucks
away his crutches, and cries, " Come to my arms, you young dog, and
say what a blackguard you 've been,"—and then all ends happily.
Mr. Pinebo may think that this will do for "Girls and Boys,
but he makes a mistake if he fancies it will suit grown-up playgoers.
As to likening it, as some of the Critics have done, to L Ami Fritz,
except that a Pupil, or Pupil-teacher, marries the bald-headed
Schoolmaster who is old enough to be her father, much in the same
way as the ingenue discovers her love for Fritz, there is not nearly
so much resemblance between this piece and Mr. Craven's Meg's
Diveniont, which holds its own because of the strong female interest
of the story. Much of Mr. Pinero's dialogue in this piece, except
where it is melodramatically stagey, recalls Mr. Graves's style in
Jf«o'«Z)»ferMon*,whiohhadfarmoreof the "scent of the hay" about
it than has this latest effort of the Author of The Squire, who must
get over his hay-fever as quickly
as possible, and when he does so,
we trust he will find himself in
clover; but, in the meantime,
the rustic soul of Mr. Pinero
must be content with the fact
that he has evoked his Girls and
Boys to come out and play in the
Toole-house, that thongn there
is very little plot, there is a part
well laid out for a first-rate
Garden, and an air of "Holme
sweet Holme" pervading the
entire scene.
Mr. Toole, as Solomon, the
Cobbler - Schoolmaster, is im-
mensely funny, and his perform-
ance will probably carry the
piece, and work it up into a
success. No matter how good the
others are—and they are excep-
tionally good—the audience are
impatient till Mr. Toole is on
the Btage, and then they only
care for what he has got to say or
do. A plot must be of absorbing
interest to struggle against such a comic presence as the favourite
comedian represents as Solomon Protheroe.
Mr. Billington, as the peppery old curmudgeon kind of character
out of an old-fashioned farce, is that and nothing more; while of
Murch, his body-servant (whom Mr. Shelton makes up more like a
body-snatcher), there is, on the whole, a trifle too Murch. It is just
suoh an outrageous character as Charles Dickens was fond of
introducing, and we seem to remember his prototype in one of his
novels -in Little Dorrit, we fancy—when his name was Flinticineh.
Mr. E.W. Ward plays the adopted son with great care and dis-
cretion; and it is immensely to his praise as an actor, that no one
oould possibly recognise in the eccentric character of Collingicood

ing in a comic duett with that eminent vocalist, Mr. T, L. Toole,
the representative of the young lover in the comedy. Mr. Wars
is evidently something more than a
mere character actor, which line does
not differ much from the art of the
"entertainer," and should have a very
promising career before him.
Mr. Garden's Joe Barfield, the
Country Carpenter, gives us what they
call a " good little bit of local colour-
ing," which only means that he has to
represent the commonplace stage yokel,
who grins through the proverbial
horse-collar.
The school children are well drilled.
Miss Eliza Johnstone as Honor, the
Spinster, is magnificent in her wedding
costume and bonnet, and, as usual,
gives most efficient support to the
"Johnny" who is the Boss of the
Show.
Miss Ely Kempster's Jenny Kibble
is, doubtless, very good. We felt sure
of that, because she is "such an art-
less thing." Only we oould not under-
stand the character, either what it was, or why there; and until
Solomon proposed to her (just like Solomon), just by way of bringing
down the curtain merrily, we thought the figure had made some
mistake, and had come out of some other piece. This, however,
is only against the character, not against Miss Eemfster, who
seemed to us to be playing it perfectly—however it got there.
Miss Myra Holme has to play the very difficult part of a character
without a character, Gillian West, the circus-rider, who is an ad-
venturess or nothing; and ceasing, as she suddenly does, to be an
adventuress, she becomes absolu-
tely a colourless nothing. Is she
to be loved or disliked P Is she
intended to excite our sympathies?
Well, Miss Holme manages this
last admirably by herself, and
without any help whatsoever from
the character, beyond what may be
called the merest hints of the
Author's hidden meaning, which,
we fancy, he himself would find it
somewhat difficult to explain
lucidly to anyone's satisfaction,
including his own. Miss Holme's
performance suggests the idea that
Gillian West has been forced into
being an adventuress — not that
this is what the Author meant—
that she is of anything but a
Bohemian temperament, and that
all her circus-slang is assumed.
rider, but it is in Miss Holme pretending to be an adventuress that
the audience find themselves interested.
Guffin's Elopements is still, and still is likely to be, the "laugh-
able farce to follow," in which Mr. Toole sings, with any number
of encore verses, " The Speaker's Eye "—words by Mr. Law, and
music by the Great Too-Tootling George Grossmith. Of Mr.
Ward's performance in this farce we have already spoken. For
several hearty laughs we recommend the bill of fare at Toole's

AKABI'S CASE.
(Brief on Behalf of the Defendant.)
Aram Pasha, the Defendant in this case, is accused of being a
rebel, a coward, an incendiary, a thief, and a murderer. For some
time he was in the Egyptian Army, and, during his service therein,
he rose to be a Colonel, a Pasha, an Under-Secretary, a Secretary of
State, and a Dictator. He also was awarded the highest Oriental
Decoration by the Sultan, avowedly because he was a rebel, a
coward, an incendiary, a thief, and a murderer. The Defendant
denies the accusations, and answers that all he did was for the
benefit of his native country, in the interests of the British, with the
consent of the Khkdivk and at the instigation of the Sultan.
Proofs.
The Defendant is at present a prisoner in the hands of the
Egyptians, supervised by the British Army of Occupation. He will
prove that he is, and always has been, passionately attached to
practical joking. He remembers having frightened the present
Khedive into fits by asking him riddles at the head of half-a-dozen
battalions of negro troops. He also has some recollection of causing
the bombardment of Alexandria by jgood-humouredly preparing to
blow the English Fleet off the face of the waters. He will produce
telegrams proving that he did not take a step without the consent of
the Sultan, and that the idea of firing under cover of a flag of truce
was suggested by the Khedive at the instigation of the French
Controller-General. He will also hand in a letter from Prince Yon
Bismarck approving of the murder of M. de Lesseps with a carving-
knife labelled, " Sir Gabnet Wolseley." He will prove that the
torches used in causing the conflagration at Alexandria were fur-
nished by M. Gbevy, President of the French Republic, and that
the guns used in the defence of Tel-el-Kebir were officered by Artil-
lery, kindly lent by the Czar. He will explain that the rough
sketch of the campaign was furnished to him by the King of Italy,
after consultation with the Emperor of Austria and the King of the
Belgians. He will give an account of the arms, ammunition, and
accoutrements lent to him by the President of tie Swiss Republic
and the King of the Netherlands. He will finally declare that he
was not at war with the English, never fired a shot at an European,
and only remained in Egypt during the disturbances, because he was
employed as a Special Correspondent on the staffs of The Record,
The St. James's Gazette, and The Sunday at Home.
CaU
The Sultan of Turkey, who will corroborate the evidence of the
Defendant. The Witness will also prove (under pressure} that he was
present at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir in a balloon, from which coign of
vantage he direoted the movements of the Egyptian Army. He will
also admit (under pressure) that he loved Ababi as his own son,
destined him as his successor on the Imperial Throne, in consideration
of a promise of £E.90,000,000 (a promise already sold to the Galata
Bankers for £50 British) and undertook to present medicated coffee to
Sir E. Colvin, the Duke of Connauoht, and Admiral Seyhoub.
CaU
The " False Prophet," a gentleman of uncertain identity. This
Witness will prove that the Defendant had no intention of organising
the Egyptian Rebellion, having arranged (in the event of the Soudan
becoming an undesirable resting-place for the Witness) to enter into
partnership with the Witness, under the title of " Ababi, Snooks, &
Co.," to carry on a Wine and Cigar Commission business in or about
the neighbourhood of the Haymarket, London.
CaU
The Khedive of Egypt, alias Tewttk (pronounced "Toothpick "),
who will corroborate the evidence of the Defendant. This witness
will also prove (under pressure) that he advised the Defendant to
take the steps of which the English Government complain, being
desirous of retiring from Egypt. He will admit that he offered to
abdicate in favour of the Defendant, on the latter undertaking to
purchase a house for him in South Kensington, and a perpetual
right to occupy a Stall at the Gaiety. He will allow (under
pressure) that the idea was repudiated by the Defendant, on account
of a trivial dispute about the purchase of some gas-fittings.
Call
Prinoe Von Bismarck, who is Chancellor of the German Empire.
This Witness will put in a long correspondence in cipher between all

This is a oity where the sale of drink is practically unrestricted.
The basement of about every third house in the most frequented
streets is a drinking-shop; and there are plenty of cafes and
restaurants, where the people' sit, and read, and drink, and smoke
in comfort. There are no hxed hours of closing, and yet the taverns
are quiet and orderly, and liquor is good and cheap. A drunken
man is rare, a drunken woman rarer. The fact that two hundred
Police are found sufficient to control 400,000 people, including a
large maritime population, may be taken as a proof that grown
men, if not British slaves, can occasionally be trusted to look after
themselves.
Beer is freely mixed with music, Sundays and working days.
Dancing is popular, and is not watched by the Police. The German

piece at any theatre we go to by heart. And the people one meets
are always the same, and the suppers are always the same, except
that they used to be cheery, about the time one left Eton, and are
now uncommonly dreary.
Oakley. You should see a Doctor, old Chappie, or, with any luck,
we shall be losing you. You don't take enough exercise.
Crowndale. That comes well from you, who have to take a cab
from the Albany to Piccadilly Circus. I take heaps of exercise. I
was at the Fencing Club over an hour this afternoon.
Oakley. Did you have the gloves on?
Crowndale. Well, no, but I saw a lot of chaps who did; and, do
you know, I believe that at times, when you are a bit off colour,
seeing other people take exercise does you as much good as taking it

Oakley. So have we all, and a very small sum it is.
Crowndale. She has about eight hundred or a thousand a year.
Oakley. What's the use of that?
Crowndale. None to us, living as we live now. But married life
is so much cheaper.
Oakley. So they say; but a Stall at the Gaiety costs ten shillings,
and two Stalls a sovereign. There's not much saving there.
Crowndale. When you are married, you don't want to go to the
Gaiety every night.
Oakley. No, because your wife won't let you; but you must go
somewhere—to the Lyceum, or the Opera, or some place where you
are bored.
Crowndale. Nonsense! When a man is married, he has a home,
and his things round him
Oakley. Yes, in the shape of rates and taxes and gas-bills
Crowndale. No, his comforts, books, pictures, furniture.
Oakley. You can't have what you would call a rollicking evening
with an arm-chair. As for books, when Mrs. Kensington bolted
with Bioomsb0ry, and nobody could make out why she went with
such a little beast, I said that Kensington belonged to the Grosvenor
Gallery, and used to take home all the new books, and read them to
her of an evening. All the Johnnies at mess agreed with me that she
was perfectly justified.
Crowndale. Ah! but that has nothing to do with it. Really, a
man is much steadier when he is married.
Oakley. Because he is so much harder up.
Crowndale. Because he doesn't waste money in idiocy.
Oakley. Then there is no hunting, no shooting, no fishing?
Crowndale. My bonny boy, matrimony doesn't stop them.
Oakley. Certainly not, if you have a place of your own; but it
would for you. People are glad enough to see you at their houses;
but you, with a wife, are a serious undertaking.
Crowndale. Does a man want to be shooting and hunting all his
life?
Oakley. Not all; but about half of it. Then there's no New-
market.
Crowndale. Why not?
Oakley. You can't go punting when you 've got a wife to keep.
Crowndale. No, I suppose not.
Oakley. Of course not. No Greenwich, no Richmond, no launches,
no picnics, no old friends.
Crowndale. Do you think I should give up one of my old
friends?
Oakley. You all ask that question indignantly, but you always do
give up your old friends. Look at Lawrence!

marriage is. If a Johnny with scarlet-fever were to come into a
room full of his pals, no name would be bad enough for him; but a
man goes and selfishly marries, and not a word's said against Mm.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Longman's New Monthly Magazine gives, as far as quality goes,
a good sixpenn'orth, though, in spite of the varied attractions,
and even of Mr. Anstey's story, which is a very funny idea, and
sounds like a series of those German comic picture-sheets told in
one short tale, we could wish it were all James Payn, as by the
time we 'd reached the end of the Third Chapter of "Thicker than
Water," it was most annoying to find that a month must elapse
before we Bhall hear any more of it; and by that time we shall have
quite forgotten the commencement. It's one of the best openings
James Payn has given for some time; in fact, it is as sparkling as
the opening of Cham-pagne. "Thicker than Water, or a Tale
of the Thames, and the Magic Microscope" but we will not
anticipate. The plan of interleaving this magazine with occasional
advertisements may be very profitable, but it is calculated to spoil
the reader's temper, and does not improve its appearance.
The Pig Family (published by Griffith and Fabkan), by
Abthub. A. Gibson.—Good nursery book, illustrated by a talented
Artist, who must have had a stye in his eye.
Our Little Ones.—A biggish book for them, profusely illustrated
by an army of Artists. We were going to have said "a host of
Artists," only as, in these days of art-patronage, there are so many
of 'em, and hostesses too, the expression is liable to misconstruc-
tion. The illustration to "Willie and Pussie," which is repeated on
the Wrapper, is especially good.
Fairy Gifts, illustrated by Kate Greenawat, can be obtained for
a small sum. The Fairies have appointed, as trustees for their gifts,
Messrs. Griffith and Fabran in London, E. P. Dillon in New
York, and probably other trustees for Farran parts.
The cover of Fairy Zand is superior to Faxry Gifts; a fact that
may be interesting to Fairy Sportsmen. The stories in both are
amusing, and considerably above the average.
If you want to ascertain the real value of a book intended for
children, try it on them, and see how they like it. We did this with

DOCTOR BRIGHTON.
"One of the beet physicians our city ever
knew is kind, oheerful, merry D>otor Brighton."
The Netocomes.
Though long it is since Titmarsh wrote;
His good advice we still remember,
When bad catarrh and rugged throat
Are rife in town in Grey November!
So, if your temper's short or bad,
Or of engagements you are full, man;
Or if yon 're feeling bored or sad,
Make haste and get aboard the Pullman 1
And throw all physio to the dogs—
If Life's sad burden you would lighten—
Run quick away from London fogs,
And call in cheerful Doctor Brighton I
Though many years have passed away.
And countless cares to not a. few oome,
The plaoe is bright as in the day
Of Ethel, Clive, and Colonel Newcome:
The East Street shops are just as gay
The turtle still as good at Mutton's;
The buns at Stkeetek's—so they say—
As well-beloved by tiny gluttons 1
Ton still can gallop o'er the Down,
Or swim at Brill's just like a Triton.
A smile will supersede your frown
When you consult kind Dootor Brighton!
In spite of foolish, scornful sneer,
You '11 find the place is not forsaken;
Still people thickly throng the Pier,
And still the " Ship " is kept by Bacon.
There no one wants to stay at home,
The sun is bripht, the sky unclouded;
We 've Rutin's Concerts at the Dome,
And Brandkam's Readings overcrowded!
How pleasant 'tis to laugh and laze,
Where light and air enjoyment heighten!
Too short the hours, too few the days,
We pass with merry Dootor Brighton!
PORTRAIT OF A JOURNALIST DRAWN
BY A COMEDIAN
{An Answer to M. Mirbeau's "Comedian drawn
by a Journalist.")
There are many occupations that add
nothing to the stock of human property, and
foremost amongst these is that of the Journal-
ist. He is a consumer, but not a producer.
He eats, drinks, and sleeps, but creates
nothing of permanent value. He has no
opinions, or. if he has, he stifles them for a
paltry consideration. He writes not what he
thinks, but what he is told. One day he is a
Conservative, the next a Radical. The little
talent he possesses, he sells in the open
market to the highest bidder. _ He makes a
mis-statement, which brings him a dinner:
he oorreots it under pressure which brings
him another. The perfection of his art is to
conceal his ignorance. He does this by
always keeping a lesson ahead of the Public
What he learns to-day, he teaches to-morrow.
• • * » •
He has the courage of stupidity, nothing
more. He will tell the Politician he knows
nothing of politics, the Artist he knows
nothing of painting, the Author he knows
nothing of writing, and then pass gaily to
the theatre, where he occupies seats that
would be paid for by the Public, and tell the
Actor that he knows nothing of aoting.
• • • •
When he dies, there is only one proper
inscription for his tombstone—"He taught
his grandmother to suck eggs."
"New Lamps for Old Ones!"
Now that the verdict on the Pullman Car
disaster has condemned passengers' reading-
lamps, and practically authorised Railway
Directors to stop their use, let us hope that
railway carriages will be properly lighted.
Reading lamps were only bought and carried
to remedy a defect in railway management.
Light reading is largely sold on the darkest
lines, and light reading is sadly in want of
light carriages.
"A Penny foe tour Thoughts."—Mr.
Labouchere offers Mr. Irving Bishop £1000
if the latter can read his thoughts. Very
difficult to (ret at the Truth, specially if the
M.P. for Northampton is thinking that he
won't tell, for he isn't the sort of man. who
"doesn't know what to think." Let Mr.
Irving Bishop Bing to himself, "Of what is
my Labby thinking, As he sits in his old
arm-chair?" and give it up.

DANGEROUS FOR MADEMOISELLE REPUBLIC.
GOOD NEWS FOR BURGLARS.
[An ingenious couple at Bolton having caught a burglar by leaving the
door on the latch, he waa brought up at the present Manchester Atsuea, when
the Judge ruled that the charge of burglar; could not be proceeded with,
inasmuch as the door was not secured, and the prisoner could only be tried
for being found on the premises under suspicious circumstances.]
On, merry is the Burglar that stands beside the door;
He'll enter in and steal my tin, or, maybe, something more.
And so, before he starts his game or steals a single "rap,"
What if I note his presence there, and catch him in a trap?
I leave the door what's called ajar—the robber enters in,
With stocking'd feet upon his beat he walks, but lo! I win.
Before he can steal anything my just revenge I wreak
Upon him, for I seize him,—then we oome before the Beak.
The case is sent for trial; when cries out the learned Judge,
"He's not a Burglar, hasty Sir,—your charge is nought but fudge;
He did not break in, for the door was left ajar that day.
His presence waa suspicious,—and that's all that I can say."
So bar the door, and let the thief break in as best he can,
But do not try as once did I to trap that honest man;
For, when you come before the Judge, he '11 state it's his belief,
You mustn t set a trap to catch the most notorious thief!
Peace Woke, or a Holiday Task for our Army.—Teaching
the young idea how to shoot.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

CLOTURE; Oil, IHE HOUSE COLLARED BY GLADSlOA'E.
Monday Night, November 6.—All very well to talk of lack of
loyalty to Sir Stafford Nobtbxote, as leader of the Opposition.
Touching evidence given to-night of falsity of assumption. Sir
Stafford had undertaken to move rejection of First Resolution.
His Amendment stood far down on the paper. Apparently no
chance of coming on till very late, perhaps not till to-morrow. At
half-past seven. Sir Stafford sitting on Front Opposition Bench,
thinking whether he should walk home to dinner or drive. Pleasant
thing to get away for a couple of hours. Some compensation for
being in Opposition, Gladstone gets only forty minutes for his
dinner.
"Stoking himself, not dining, J oall it," Colonel Habcourt said,
one night, when he saw the Premier coming back hurried and
eager. Colonel doesn't greatly love Weo, but is not above human pity.
For once touched with commiseration for a man who has only forty
minutes to dine in, including going and coming back.
Sir Stafford musing on these matters. Suddenly bombshell from
the Chair falls upon House. Three Amendments swept off at
one blow. The main Resolution would be on in half-an-nour, and
Sir Stafford must make his speech.
"Why, bless my soul," the Rt. Hon. Baronet said, half rising
and turning towards the Chair a face from which every vestige of
colour had faded, "I haven't had my dinner!"
"Sit down," said young Lord John, ready for any emergency.
"We '11 manage it."
And so they did.
Row got up on one of the Amendments ruled out. Sir Stafford
hastily left the House.
"Keep it up!" he whispered—" for heaven's sake, keep it up I It
takes me a quarter of an hour to get to St. James's Place."
"We will! we will!" his ooUeagues murmured, warmly grasping
his hand.
When Speaker stopped discussion as irregular, Chaplin boldly
moved Adjournment of Debate. That was good for another half-
hour.
"He's got a start of an hour now," Lord Joun said. "Think
that should do." 1 Motion for Adjournment accordingly withdrawn.
Ordinary business* proceeded with; and Sir Stafford, having com-
fortably dined, came back, and moved his Amendment.
"Noble fellows, .Toby, he said to me, narrating the circum-
stances a little later. Such presence of mind, such fertility of
resouroe, and such self-sacrifice, for it was their own dinner-hour.
Reconciles me to much that is unpleasant below the Gangway. I '11
never desert them, Tobt, never!
Business dune.—Sit Stafford Northcote dined.
Tuesday Night.—Curious how when a man not habitually a
humorist is smitten with a funny idea he carries it to grotesque
limits. Here's Rowland Winn for example, one of the best fellows
in the House, slaves for his party as if he were paid by the week
and otherwise had no bread. Here late and early, always courteous
and obliging and rarely fatigued. When he is, can sleep on the
Front Bench with his hat at a sharper angle than any man of his
age and fighting weight. Been hard at work sinoe Autumn Session
commenced, fighting pluckily againBt a big majority. Afraid he has
overworked himself, and that his demoniac joke is result of dis-
ordered brain.
However it be, here he is to-night going about with a slip of paper
swearing in Conservatives to make speeches on First Resolution.
He began last night, first of all in small way, trying it on with
Warton and the Alderman. But as joke grew upon him, went on
with increasing excitement. Now he's got sixty names, and still
he isn't happy.
"I'll make it a hundred," he says, "a round hundred. I'll
teach these Liberals what I am when I *m roused! I '11 give 'em a
Rowland for their Oliver!"
A hundred speeches from Conservative Members I If anybody
but the young and vigorous can stand that, I '11 retire from political
life.
Had seven hours of it to-night, and feel a little feeble. Members
generally led in affright, and House made by an average of twelve
mem. Rowland more busy than ever. In addition to going about
with kis slip of paper getting names, he has to keep the barrel-

organ going. When one tune finished, gives a turn of the handle,
and another commences. All much the same.
One remarkable result is the bringing out of new men. Speaker
doesn't know half of them by sight. At first there was strong sus-
picion that Rowland was playing larks—that he 'd smuggled in
some men from the Speaker's Gallery, and put them up to talk.
Sir Chahi.es Furstkr amazed.
"Wonderful!" he says. "Actual fulfilment of the Last Words
of Marmitm—
"And men speak now who never spoke before,
And those who always speak now spoke the more."
Amongst other curious discoveries made, we find we have two
PnirpsKs in the House. Never saw or heard either before. Now
both appear, and burst forth in impassioned prose. Pickering got
on pretty well, but Charles rather stuck.
"Phipps is certainly not fluent," Sir William Habcoubt audibly
remarked as the Member for Westbury rambled through one of the
sentences that varied the brilliant flashes of silence which chiefly con-
stituted his tpeech. Butineti done.—Rowland Winn's coup-d'tlat.
Thurtday Night.—Great day this for the Lord Mayor of Dublin.
Very odd, when one comes to think of it, how Mr. Dawson's " body"
is always being made the centre of a struggle. On a famous occa-
sion, Mr. Fokster, suspected of designs upon Mrs. Dawson, was
solemnly warned in House of Commons that he would have to step
over the dead body of Mr. D. That happily was sufficient. Gave
time to Forsteb to reflect. And with reflection came the re-estab-
lishment of better principles more suited to Quaker parentage. He
refrained; shortly afterwards resigned Chief-Secretaryship; Mr.
Dawson found the prostrate attitude unnecessary, and the Lord
Mayor of Dublin still walks among us with head erect and great
thoughts glowing in his bosom.
To-night, Lord Mayor breaks out in fresh place. Some Members
of the Corporation of Dublin want to present a sword of honour to
Garnet Wolseley. Others object, presumably on ground that it
would not be an honour at all. Voting very close. Lord Mayor
Dawson and three others would probably turn scale one way or
other Shall he go. or shall he stay f Dublin cries, "Come I" West-
minster whispers Stay!"
"If I could only succeed in Dublin myself, I could manage," says
the Lobd Mayor, who sometimes unbends and makes little jokes.
But that cannot be. It is only a bird that can be in two places at
one time, and the Lobd Matob has only the majestic manners of the
Eagle, being short of his wings.
"We must have Dawson's vote," says Sir Staffobd Nobthcote.
"As a rule, I agree with Chaplin—Irish Vote is demoralising.
Leads to dark rumours in the Lobby of unholy alliances. But
Dawson's support is
. \ \ I . morally worth a score.
Whilst we're about it,
we may as well have other
three."
Mr. Gibson, man-of-
all-work on Front Oppo-
sition, undertook to see it
through.
"The Irish Vote is
nothing to us. Your
Lordship's countenance is
everything," he said in
mcllitiuous tones.
Lord Matob said he
would think it over. At
present his mind occupied
with other matters; but
if meeting of Corporation were postponed, his way would be easier.
"Ha!" said Mr. Gibson, then we'll see about that. Her
Ladyship quite well, I trust'( No midnight marauders, I am sure?
How well your Lordship looked in your red gown and gold chain the
other week. Have always thought there should be a special
ordinanoe that Lord Mayor of Dublin should sit in the House of
Commons in gown and chain. When we come back to office we
must see about it."
In meantime Gibson saw about Corporation Meeting in Dublin.
Arranged to get it postponed. Lobd Mayor remains to vote. Tele-
Jraphed all over the country to stop homeward flight of other three
rish Members, and State is once more saved.
"I '11 write a chapter on this for the next edition of A Eittory of
Our Own Times," says Justin M'Cabtht. "Caklyle's story of
the ohace after the New Berline shall pale before my account of
how they stopped T. D. S. at Holyhead, and how they dogged by
telegraph the steps of Gill as he fled towards Dublin."
"A little hard on Wolseley," Colonel Home said to Colonel
Stanley. "Rather spoils his chance, doesn't it, by postponing
Division from day inconvenient to Land-Leaguers to one that will
Buit themP"

^^g.
Egypt v. Northampton; or, The Silenced
Member.
"Really don't know anything about it," said late War Minister.
"Gibson manages these things for us. All I know is we never
traftio in the Irish vote."
Business done.—Four Irish votes saved to the Constitution.

bir C. Dilke put to the Torture of the Question.
Saturday Morning.—First Resolution disposed of at last. Not
quite a dozen more. Begin to hope prorogation will take place on
Midsummer Day, with three days' holiday at Christmas. Rather
lively last night. Joe Cowen came out pretty strong, and said all
the Conservatives have been trying to say for three weeks.
Butinets done.—First Resolution carried by 304 votes against 260.
KABBY AND SKOOL BORD.
Dear Mr. Punch,
I ave been purvented standin for skool bord by wot I reads
in Punch, I sees as every chap as wants to get on skool bord must
pass 7 stanards. And then there is summat about igher edioation
as I don't understand. I knows that my son Jem has druv the
ighest buss in London this three months—one of them Yankee
fashioned things more like a herse than an onest buss— and says I to
im, Jem, my boy, says 1, you just mind your i wen you is up yonder,
for they says as ow that pride will ave a fall. But to come back to
skool bord there be two coves as wants my vote, one is for igher
edioation and tother isn't, and what the dooce they means I'm
blamed if I know. Blow me if I think they knows themsels.
Between you and me and the door post I am shure it's just a trick
to get more money out of us poor foax. I shan't anayow vote for
the igher edication dodge—not if I knows it.
There is my boy Tommy 12 year old and could earn his eight bob
a week and can read and rite as well as the parson but the skool bord
won't let him do a days work. If he do, skool bord man threatens
to sell me up and send me to quod slick off. And Jbmimab Ann
mustn't stop at home to mind the babby. Babbies indeed! Babbies
must look arter themselves—that is the babbies of us poor foax. But
my neighbour as lives round the corner and pays forty quid of rent
skool bord man never comes and bullies his missus. His kids may
run about the streets all day long and play all sorts of devilment for
ought skool bord cares. It is only us poor foax that gits bullied
ana fined and sent to quod. If 1 was on the skool bord 1 'd just tell
em a bit of my mind. But it's to keep out the likes of me that they
talks of their seven stanards and their igher edioation. The fact
is they know nowt about us poor foax and they don't want to know.
Your humble servant to command,
A West End Kabby.
Putting it Pleasantly.
Dear Malet,—That old Sultan is a shammer.
Tewfik—well, every Copt can do a "crammer."
Hot work, you see, upon the Egyptian anvil!
A Malet 's good, but for a regular " lammer,"
We need a man who " comes down like a hammer."
DuFFEBiN 's a Nasmyth. 1'wiggez-vout f
Yours, Granville.
A Wobd in Season.—In the approaching Royal Review we hope
to see the Marines and the Naval Contingent efficiently represented.
Gratitude is short-lived, and the work once over, we soon manage
to forget who did it, in our satisfaction at its having been thoroughly
done. In honouring Tommy Atkins, don't let us overlook Jack and
the Jollies.
The Sublime Bubke.—The Cloture.

to make the peroession simply perfeot. And what a peroession it
were 1 I was among the Cripples in the Lord Mare's own Ward,
and saw it all beautifully. I consider, and many of my perfeshnal
Brethren thinks so too, that it was about the handsomest and the
longest and the Bandyest, so to speak, and the most Artistikest
as has been seen for many years, and reflected great credick on
the Bishop of Doctors' Commons who arranged it. Wny the 12 men
in solid armour was of itself almost subblime. And what banners,
and what flags, and what Beedles on boxes, and what Robbing
Hoods and Thames Angulers was there! And didn't the Mob iest
enjoy it all, and cheer everybody and everything; and when I asked
some on 'em if they didn't think as it was a'most time it was all
abolished, they akshally threatened to punch my 'ed. till I told 'em

THE DIVINING ROD.
This simple Instrument is employed, by those beillbd in its use, for
Detecting the presence of Genius, where there are no outward indica-
tions OBSERVABLE. THE liOD BEING HELD IN THE RlGHT HAND, BECOMES
INVOLUNTARILY AND VIOLENTLY AGITATED ON APPROACHING THE SEAT OF THE
DESIRED QUALITY.
Dooks and Ambassiders, and Prime Ministers, and other Ministers, who, if not
quite so prime, tried to look as much like it as possible, and beautiful Ladies
and Countesses and Wieountesses, all smothered over with Dimuns and Purls
and Jewells.
Ah! pretty sort of Raddikles you must be to wish to see a meer ordinary
Dook a tilling the City Chair of Honner, instead of the extrordinary City School
Boy. What does the Poet say, in words as Burns as well as konwinoes:—
The Qu ben can make a Sherif a Knight, I But a City School Capting 'a aboon her might,
A Markis a Dook, and a' that; I 'm dished if ahe can 3a' that!"
Who made the City what it is. the enwy and admirashun of the world?
Dooks? Markisses? Erls? No I but your Dick Whittingtons, and your
Tom Greshams, and your John Carpenters, and your Habry Knights.
And now as them and others like 'em has brought us and is a-bringing us as
near to perfeoshun as is possible, in the grand old City, some low noisy nungry
people wants to make a change and try a Dook or two. Yes, I should like to see
the Dook or the Markiss as 'ud like to have to sign his name 30,000 times a ear
and get nothink for it, and to take the cheer at a grand Dinner about three or
four times a week and pay a good deal for it. I should like to know how his
poor fingers would feel at the end of his ear, let alone his poor stummack.
One thing strikes me as werry sad and solium. Wen the ugly Law Courts,
as is close to the butifle Griffin at Temple Bar, is opened, as they will seon be,
how about the Lord Mare's peroession nex year? Why the head of it will be at
their latter end before the end of it is off.
Brown says it's all been eranged on purpose, so that nex year there shall
he a exkuse for abolishing the lot, and so saving his Grace the Dook of
Aaminster, who is to be the first Lord Mare of all London, the large expense of
the thow.
Of course I don't bleeve a word of it, but it does seem rayther a singular
double coincidense.
Why the shabby War Office wouldn't let the poor Solgers from Egyp march
in the peroession, which would of course have bin a fit and proper reward for all
their trubble in going all the way there and then coming all the way back again,
let a lone the flys and the dust, I can't think. I 'm told as they was all werry
down-hearted about it, speshally Sir Cabdinax Wolsey and Admiral Seamore.
All jellersy I spose, as ushal, but I did expeo more lib-
berality from the Comander-in-chief, knowing as I do his
partickler partiality for Turtel.
Buy the buy that brings to my recklection a little anny-
goat. A grand dinner was a being held at the sillybrated
Ship and Turtel, when the Chairman acshally found
fault with the Soap! and when the estonished Landlord
said as how it was the werry same sort as he had sent
that arternoon to the D k of C——e, the Chairman,
who was a reglar Corporation Chairman, of course ex-
claimed in a towering passion, "What does the D k
of C e know about Turtel compared to one of us?"
and the poor Landlord blusht and retired.
But I must return to my Wenson as the French says.
I didn't think the Turtel quite so golopshus as ushal.
The Thick was too flowery and the Clear was too Spanish
Lickoricy for my taste. It may be as I'm a gitting
kritikuller as I gets older, but Messers Bring and
Rhymer must look to their laurelled brows or they '11
find interlopers in their matchless Soup. I wunder they
don't send a little to Miss Patty ana Mrs. Longtree,
and then ask 'em how it agrees with the complexion, as
Mr. Pears does with hiss matchless Sope.
We had the tell-tale Lectrick Light again, and I finds
in that case as familyarity breeds more oontemp than
ushal. It's the meanest and the most shabbyest and
the most degradingest inwention of modern times, and
always makes me feel as if I was surrounded with a hole
barmy of Detectives I
Is there no such thing as confidence left betwix man
and man that a Hed Waiter is to be insulted while in the
performance of his difficult, and let me add his dellycate,
dooties, with this modern Hargus, as I thinks they used
to call him, a staring at him with all his hunderd eyes?
I 'm told the inwenter was a Dr. Seemen, werry likely I
should think, for I 'm sure no Dr. Seewomen would ever
have behaved so cruelly to them. It littorally flays 'em
after about 40.
The Lord Mare spoke butiful, just like a little book,
just as if he hadn't left the City School much above a
year or so. I thort I could catch just a little of the grand
style of his old master, Dr. Abbott, and werry pleased
we all was to ear it.
We all likes to hear the Docter speak after Dinner,
speshally when he looks up at the sealing as if he could
see sumthink writ up there, cos then we knows as sum-
think high and lofty is a coming, and he never disapints
us Waiters, never.
Nex to the Lord Mare, Mr. Gladstone was no dout
the Ero of the Evening. I notioed particklar as he
hadn't got more than a average amount of collar up, so
he was abel to speak as carm and as quiet as a poor
Curate before his bisshup.
Who could have thort to look at him and to hear him,
that he was the Saint George who was to destroy the City
Griffin! Ah! my long egsperience enables me to say,
you never can judge a man s character by how he looks
juBt after dinner, nor by what he says just after dinner.
There's a souporific and a soothing sumthink as cums
over 'em just at that time, as tames the wildest and
savagest nature. Why I 've seen even the Speaker of
the House of Commons larf after Dinner!
All the young 'uns, aye and sum of the old 'uns too—
lawk if they could but see theirselves as Waiters sees
'em—finished up with a danse in the Libery, but werry
few of the tip toppers Btayed for it, but went away soon
after dinner, and so ended another anniwersary of the most
importantest day as runs through the City Cullender.

in the bygone days of orthodox

always to say, enforcing word

for the time being of which-

be:—"Now, then, pass tho

COUNSEL'S NOTES.
(A few of them from. Memory jolted, down—Broadly.')
Arrived sanguine and full of hope. Just glanoe at Pyramids
through binocular, and then to business. Call on Solicitor for
the Defence. Charming man. We converse nine hours in Arabic,
with dictionary and oouple of Interpreters. Says he thoroughly
understands my view of the case, and gives me a cup of poisoned
coffee. Spot it at once, and give him a bit of my mind without
the Interpreters: explains. Turns out that he mistook me for
the Counsel for the Proseoution. Apologises, and gives me my
instructions in a saok. Heavy. Leave Interpreters to finish coffee,
and off to my hotel on a camel.
Monday\ 6th.—Rise early: another look at Pyramids. Done
a deal this week. Been up 'em twice, and studied no end of
Egyptian law. _ Great trouble in getting at my Client. Have to
consult a Coptic Solicitor myself. Says there 's a regular legal
process to be gone through. Must gag a couple of Witnesses, write
threatening letter to Khedive, put gaoler down a well, bastinado
the Chief Justice myself, and pay his own expenses to Mecca.
To bed, thinking it over.
Monday, 13th.—Have had another go at Pyramids. Also seen
Ababi. Very nasty at first, and said, if I was going to defend him
by Egyptian law, ho would rather have it out on the spot with me
with bayonets. Bays it would oome to the same thing in the end,
and save costs. Explain to him that he shall have a fair trial,
according to English law, and not be allowed to open his mouth.
Delighted. Read Blackttone to him till he is delirious. Show him
my wig. Say it's the thing for the Sheik-ul-Islam in cold weather.
Promise to send it him if I get him off. Disagreeable incident
going out. Thrown down a well by mistake. Am got out on ex-
plaining I am not the Solicitor for Defence. Home, reflective.
Monday, 20th. — Getting to know Pyramids by heart. Bet
Mahmoud Ben Sammy, after dinner, five yards of holy stair-carpet
I would go up a couple of 'em on a donkey, and down again in half-
an-hour. Lost. Thirsty work. Explained to him this was just the
oountry for continual "refreshers." Ababi still nasty. Much
annoyed to-day by finding all my Witnesses had been put in a saok.
and given, as a douceur, to the False Prophet. Tried to convey to!
the Chief Justice that this wasn't fair, because English law never
assumes guilt till conviction. He says it 's all right by Egyptian |
law, which only is convinced that a man is innocent when ho has {
been hung. Something in this. Everybody confident I shall hvg
Something in this, too. Think it over. /

''WHAT'S IN A NAME?"
Whip. "Wisdom/ Gn awat tbibi!! Wisdom 11 Wisdom! I! Uqh !—you always wkrk thk biqosst Fool in thb Pack!"
ONLY A SHOP-GIRL!
Only a Shop-Girl! Stop your sneer! or listen at least to her tale, and then
You '11 feel the ache, and yon '11 taste the tear, in the hearts of women who trust in men.
It wasn't like this in the dear old times, with mother and father alive, that day
When a party of innocent country girls went off to the cricket, where gentlemen play;
And it seem'd no harm, in the eventide, when the sun had sunk and the tents were furled,
To wander away to the leafy lanes, by the side of the "handsomest man in the world."
There was nothing on earth that he could not do; she knew so little, and he so much:
His touch was tender, his eyes were blue ;—Dear women! Tou know there are thousands such 1
With women so silly, and men so vain, 'tis sweet to begin, and sorry to stop,—
It was only a Shop-Girl learning to love I Only a Girl of the Shop!
And the man meant well—as they sometimes do—and he loved this child in his selfish way;
He could speak so soft, and his eyes were blue, and he bought so much—with so little to pay;
Bat her father stormed, and the mother she wept, and the dear little home in the country lane
Was emptied quite of its great delight—she had gone, and could never return again.
For youth that loves—it's the way of the world—will leave old age, that has loved, in the lurch;
And the careless lovers to London came, to be married, by law—yes! instead of the Church!
So they dream'd a little, and, when they awoke, it wasn t the good little woman who shirk'd,
For she took her place at the counter-side, where many a brave little woman has worked;
But the country roses left her cheeks; if she didn't quite starve, she was ready to drop.
It was only a Shop-Girl learning to live! Only a Girl of the Shop 1
But the lips that love can be lips that lie, and the manly mouth may be cruelly curled,
Though women keep loving the eyes that are blue, and. liking the handsomest man in the
world."
Sj the toy that is broken is thrown away, and the heart embittered that once was prized;
And women who work like slaves can find their labour of love is at last despised.
They profess to be siok of the shop—these men—who nail their wives to counter and till;
They snarl and snap when they find her faint, and proceed to curse when they see she's ill:
For wave little wives must be mothers at last.—there is little for three, when sufficient for two,
So the Gordian knot it is cut by the man—who departs, as such chivalrous gentlemen do.
'Tie only a wife and a child who are left, by the cowardly fool, or the ignorant fop;
And it's only a Shop-Girl—thinking of sin—only a Girl of the Shop!
Only a Shop-Girl! Spare her, men! Who have sisters to love and mothers to pray;
She would like to be honest, but must not look ill; at least, so the good-natured customers say:
So they kindly suggest that a downtrodden wife does not fit with the trade of a practical age,
Aid she looks the wide world pretty full in the face, and turns, with a sigh of relief, to the
stage;
Not the stage as it should be—the stage as
it is—with its dazzle of jewels and
glamour of dress.
Where womenkind buzz round the candle
of fame, and scorch their poor wings—
they could scarcely do less!
From the shop to the stage 'tis a natural
step—for the bitter in spirit and broken
in heart.
Who find that, no matter how little the
wage, the profession contrives to be
mightily smart!
But the life is worth living! So gay it be-
comes! From pleasure to pleasure it
spins like a top;
See! it's only a Shop-Girl—painting her
face !—only a Girl of the Shop 1
What a sermon is here! Is Morality dumb P
Or why doesn't Virtue whine and preach
At a woman who's driven from shop to the
stage, and discovers that honesty's out
of her reach!
She thinks once more of the days at home!
as down on her pillow she sinks her head;
She sees her sisters flauntily fine, and hears
her little one cry for bread!
And then comes love—not the old, old love,
as she felt it once in the country lanes—
But a passionate fever of gilded youth,—
who reckons the cost, and who counts
the gains?
Still, a dinner or so in a time of need! and
a soft new dress for a lovely form,
Are things that most women are grateful
for,—they are sails of life that weather
the storm.
Only a Shop-Girl fallen away 1—by the road
of life! Samaritan, stop!
Only a Shop-Girl I Waiting the end! Only
a Girl of the Shop!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

General F(arourite)
Roberts.
AN EVENING FROM HOME.
On Lord Mayor's Day our Country Unole—the father of our
Country Cousins—eame up to town, by invitation, to see the Show;
and it wasn't our fault that he missed it by just five minutes; for
how on earth, while the bells were ringing from a hundred steeples
(we believe they 're in the steeples wherever
there are any steeples), while sonool-ohildren
in their thousands were shrieking at the top
of their voices, while a dozen different brass
bands, mingled with fifes and drums, were
playing as many different tunes in various
keys and times, and while a surging crowd
was yelling and hurrahing—how, we ask,
while all this din was going on, could we
possibly be aware of the f aot that our Country
Uncle was knocking and ringing at the back-
door of our office for exactly the one quarter
of an hour occupied by the Lord Mayor's
Procession in passing our front window P The
knocker is a feeble one at the best, and what
is one back-door bell against a monster
ooncert of City chimes P
Bound to make up to our Country Unole
for his having lost the procession and most
of the lunch—he came in for three doubtful
oysters, half a glass of stout, ten empty cham-
pagne bottles, and a cold potato in its jacket,
—we proposed giving him an evening in
town, which offer he olosed with there and then, and at onoe com-
menced telling us how he had not" been about" for more than fifteen
years, and howmuch he shouMenjoydmingatSiMPSON's,turninginfor
a few minutes "just to see what was going on" at some Casino; after
which he would of all things like to renew his ancient acquaintance
with the Judge and Jury, and finish with a chop and kidney at
Evans's at about one in the morning.
We reproved the Blameless Old Provincial, and explained to him
that these scenes of his childhood had passed away, and that the
Legislature expected us all to be in bed by one, instead of revelling
in kidneys and chops, and listening to underground choruses. He
sighed and delivered himself into our hands.
Having engaged a youthful " Masher " to explain modern man-
ners ana customs to our Country Unole, we took him to dine at the
Holborn Restaurant, where he was at first puzzled by the mixture
of menu and musio, and was for ordering cotelettes a la William
Tell, a cut oft the Carmen, and so forth; but on being gradually
warmed by the generous vintage of No. 5 on the list, he suddenly
rapped his knife on the table, and cried " Hush!" while his eyes
glistened, and he was as the old war-horse sniffing the battle from
afar, as the strains of the ancient "Potthorn Galop"—not an-
nounced in the programme—caught his ear. His manly breast
heaved; he gurgled out, "I 've not heard that sinoe Kcenig played
it in Jullien's time!" and when the performance, an admirable
one by the way, on a genuine posthorn, was finished, our Country
Unole applauded vociferously, and would not be satisfied until
Mr. 11 amp, the courteous and diplomatic Manager, had assured him
that as he so evidently desired an encore, the Poet-Horn Galop"
should be repeated, whereupon the worthy old Gentleman filled a
bumper, drank the horn-player's health, and once more gave the
tune his best breathless attention.
After this he was for going to hear the "British Army Quad-
rilles" at the Crowe's nest in Covent Garden, but we pointed out
that there was an excellent entertainment nearer at hand, at the
Royal, where we could enjoy the fragrant weed and the modest anti-
La wson quencher while listening to the best Comic Singers in London.
So to the Royal we went.
StallsP Not one. Boxes full. Standing roomP Yes; just
that and nothing more. As we entered, the audienoe rose as one
man and oheered enthusiastically. Before we had time to bow our
aoknowledgments from the back rows of the gallery, we were informed
that the demonstration was in honour of HR.H.'s birthday. A big
vooalist in evening-dress ("That's Habry Rickards," our young
Masher informed us, with a knowing nod and a beaming counte-
nance) then came on the stage, and sang what was evidently a highly
popular Bong, beoause the audience took up the chorus themselves
without prompting; but the refrain of which, beyond that it was
something to do with " Mary Anne," we, from our coign of disad-
vantage, oould not catch.
"Capital tune 1" exolaimed our Country Unole.- "I remember in
the old days "but his anecdote was interrupted by our young
friend, the Masher, introducing us to the Proprietor, Mr. Purkiss,
who at once expressed his willingness—" Purkiss is willin' "—to
place us in the nearest approach to comfort obtainable in such a ram-
i am-oram as there was that night, and, in the interests of our
Country Uncle, we accepted the obliging offer.
Our Country Unole, who is a non-practising barrister, and has been
a member of the Temple for thirty-five years, was much delighted
at observing that nearly all the oomio songs took place in a scene
representing, what he informed us was, the Inner Temple Library.
This, he considered, elevated the tone of the whole entertainment,
and was in itself an education for the people which met with his
highest commendation, as also, by the way, did "The Boy," which,
the Masher explained to him, was the name now given to Champagne.
"' The Life-Buoy,' I should say," chuckled the Old Man as he
drank the Lord Mayor's health in a large bell-shaped glass, and then
Sroceeded to light a oigar, while marking with Mb foot the timi of
[r. Harrt Rickards' song, "We're Not Dead Yet," wh.cb
roused' all the patriotic fire in our Country Uncle's breast. B if
that we held him back by the coat-tails, he would have been ha
out of the box, waving his hat, and shouting the chorus.
"That's Booth in the chair," said our young Mashing friend who
knows everybody, indicating the authority with the cloture hammer.
"What! the Salvationist 1" exclaimed our Country Unole, aghast.
"You don't mean that he "bnt we explained and he was
pacified.
The name of the Great Vance seemed to awaken our Uncle's
recollections, and he was commencing a racy anecdote about lie
time when there was a Musio-Hall in the Strand where the Gre\t
Vance sang his celebrated "Pretty Jemima," when he was inter-
rupted by our young companion, who denied the existence of any
Music-1 lull in the Strand, until we were able to decide that what
was a "Musick-Hall" when our Country Uncle was "about," ismw
the Gaiety, and on this being settled, he was just recommenoug
his raoy anecdote when the austere Chairman cried, "Silence!'
with the air of a man who is not to be trifled with, and in another
ten minutes our Uncle was singing at the top of his voice, "Soditl
I!" in unison with the chorus of visitors unaccompanied.
On hearing Miss Nelly Power's name, our Blameless Relativ
commenced the biographies of various celebrated Actresses whos
performances he had witnessed, but his calculations were all throwi
out by the appearance of Miss Nelly, vastly improved since our
Uncle had last seen her, at some theatre in some Burlesque (the 0'd
Man was a bit vague on the subject), when she must have been aboi t
thirteen years old. Her song of the adventures of a young Gentle
man with Eight Thousand a-year, wearing a long moustache, ana
rejoicing in the somewhat eccentric appellation of Mister " Tiddy-
fol-lol" was rapturously reoeived. As for Mr. Arthur Roberts,
our veteran relative from the Provinces declared he had never
laughed so much at any comio singer since some one, whose name
he oould neither exactly remember, nor distinctly pronounoe, bsj g
something which he was utterly unable to recall at Evans's, when
Paddy Green was Consul. Certainly General F(avourite) Robert s
is a first-rate Comedian, and the best thing he does is an illustratioi
of a billiard match from toss to finish. It is as indescribable as
inimitable, and you must be "on the spot" to see it.
With the departure of General Ftavourite) Roberts, after his best
songs of " Tidings of Comfort" and " Never done anything since,"
the audienoe began to leave, our Uncle only stopping to hear a young
Lady sing " I don't'know hmc !" which, he was of opinion, deserved
a more prominent place in the bill.
"If she doesn't know Howk," observed the youthful Masher,
who is acquainted with all Theatrical Celebrities, she has only got
to call round at the Lyceum, where Howe is playing every night."
But by the time this jest was finished, our Country Unole was ii
a hansom, safely directed, "with care," to his apartments where,
we were subsequently informed, he left the street door open, and
roused in reply to various disturbed lodgers, he could only sing, *' 1
don't know how," as he was assisted up-stairs by the landlord.
A Parisian Theatre.—It is very popular—never closed—and
never cleaned. Its sanitary arrangements date from the time of tie
Empress Josephine. Gusts of foul air oome from under the dimly-
lighted stage across the rough, ill-fitting planking of the orchestra.
The seats are so arranged that every visitor is practically locked in
like a scoundrel in the village-stocks. Footstools, for which a franc
apiece is demanded, are strewn on the floor in front of the seats, so
that as many ankles may be sprained as possible. No ventilation
was ever known to purify the building. The air-tight passages are
like the interior of a diving-bell. The dingy roof of the lobby is a
very little way above the heads of the visitors, and the gas-lamps
are under their noses. The coats that are seized by the attendants
are rolled up in bundles on the dusty floor, mixed up with the stick«
and umbrellas which few Frenchmen are ever seen without. The
broom and the scrubbing-brush are not upon the " free list.' A
portion of a programme dropped in a corner in June may be fo md
again in December. Space that might be less showily, but moie
usefully employed, is devoted to a "foyer," or drawing-room, in whic.
photographers advertise. The tawdry decorations of the theatn
might be the adornment of a third-class lodging-house. The only
wonder is that the place is not honoured with a National Subvention.

FROM OUR OWN SATURDAY REVIEWER.
What a day for a Review! As your Own Saturday
Reviewer I s'arted early in a fog.
0 that fog! I lost my way, and it was only owing to my
having an excellent ear for musio that I detected " 0<id
Save the Queen" in five different keys, played simul-
taneously in the distance, and regardless of obstruction,
I charged the crowd, the sentries at the Horse Guards
saluted me, and I arrived just in time to wave my hat to
Her Gracious Majesty, as the curtain of fog drew up,
the sunlight was turned on, and the scene presented a
speotacle which I shall never forget, and cannot at this
moment, after a beautiful luncheon with a hospitable
friend, exactly remember.
We had first of all oysters—no, I mean Sir Garnet
Wolselet— then sonp (oh, how famished I was!)—then
General Drury Lowe and Colonel Ewart—then there
was a talmi of game and first-rate Pommery—but you '11
excuse me, I 'm sure, if, at this late hour, I somewhat
mix up a sumptuous meal, which was dinner, breakfast,
and luncheon all in one, with the march past. It is an
exceptional day—I wish there were more exceptional
days. I stood next to a well-informed individual, who
was always pointing out the wrong person, until I could
stand it no longer, and chose my own men out of the lot,
and said, authoritatively to the bvBtanders, "That is
Sir Garnet!" and " That is Sir'Evelyn!" Then the
bystanders oheered loudly, and the two Generals or
Colonels, whatever thev were whom 1 had seleoted for this
honour, were immensely pleased with the reception. No
matter, I dare say they deserved what they got, and am
glad they liked it.
How the brave commanders shouted !" By your right
—forward !"—infantry and cavalry alike were such very
hoarse guards! The Marine* were then led by the Ultra
Marines mounted; and the Naval Contingent shared the
popularity of the hour with the Seaforth Highlanders.
The Confiding Bystanders listened to Tour Own Saturday
Reviewer with awe, and wiped tears from their eyes as I
raised my hat to the various oolours. It has been a grand
day—I write this as I know you are going to Press
within five minutes—and my messmates are waiting for
me to return to the festive board, to return thanks for
the Army and Navy for ever, and three oheers for the
Red, White and Blue!—Your Own S. R.
PROGRAMME FOR THE OPENING OP THE NEW
LAW COURTS.
Sir,—On the Second of next month, Her Most Gracious Majesty
has intimated her intention of opening the Royal Palaoe of Justice.
Up to the present moment nothing has been arranged to make the
visit of our Sovereign to the building a pleasant one. Surely this is
a reproach to a Profession which numbers in its ranks Statesmen,
Scientists, and Men of Letters,—a Profession which, in fact, is
eminently associated with all that is intellectual. There is a gap
which requires filling. Will you allow me, as a sort of forensic
Curtius, to jump into the gap and supply the deficiency?
I would propose something like the following programme. Let us
imagine that Hkr Majesty is seated in the central hall, surrounded
by all her Courts (inclusive, of course, of the "0,. B. D." and the
Court of Appeal), and she signifies her gracious consent that the
sports should commence. Here follow the entertainments:—
Item 1.—Preliminary Chorus, "It it Our Opening Day" by the
whole Profession. Trebles by the Junior Branch—the Solicitors;
tenors and basses by the Bar, and boIos by the Judges.
Item 2.—Character Song, by Mr. Justice Huddlestone :—
"When I tee a Duchess seated on the Bench,
I smile to her, and bow to her—so!"
Item 3.—Athletic Exercise on the Supported Plank, by the Masters
of the Bench of the Hon. Society of Gray's Inn.
Item 4.—Transformation Dance, by Sir William Vernon Har-
cot/rt, in which he will appear in the characters of an Attorney-
General, a Home Secretary, and (lastly) the Lord Chancellor.
Item 5.— Ballet a"Action by Counsel, and Solos for the Plaintiff and
Defendant.
Item 6.—Grand Military Exercise, by the Serjeants. Drill Instruc-
tor, Major-Gen. Sir Evelyn Wood, Barrister-at-Law.
Item 7.—Melancholy Ballad, by Mr. Justice Day (dedicated to
KNIGHT-Mayor) :—
"I dreamt thst I dwelt in "Westminster Hall,
With counsel end clients by my si-a-hide!"
Item 8.—Bacchanalian Chorus, by the Bad Templars (so-called, t°
distinguish tbem from the Good).
Item 9.— Grand Washing competition by the Laundresses of Lin-
coln's Inn, who will practically illustrate the mode of getting a
pair of bands into Chancery.
Item 10.—Recitation, " The Charge of the Cottt Brigade" by the
Taxing-Master.
Item 11.—Roaring Comic Song, by an Oxford Undergraduate
entered at one of the Inns of Court:—
"I'm reading for the Bar, I Tm reading for the Bar,
Tdree days each Term
In London firm.
When I 'm reading for the Bar!"
Item 12, and last.—Imposing Finale. The Profession practising on
the Publio.
There, Sir, surely something like the above ought to do! Of
course it is merely a rough sketch, which might be filled in by those
it most concerns. For instance, if Sir Henkt Hawkins could be
prevailed upon to show his strength as a hanging Judge, the pro-
gramme would be greatly improved. Again, if some of the Old
Bailey Solors led their Counsel a pretty dance to get their fees, ihe
measure would no doubt have its interest with a portion of the com-
munity. Once more: a leading advocate might practically illustrate
the feat of personally conducting four separate cases in four sepa-
rate Courts at the same time while actually present personally con-
ducting a fifth case in a fifth Court. And so on, and so on._ The
whole might conclnde with a grand distribution of largene in the
shape of pass-certificates given by the Bar Examiners to Students
who had been plucked more than seven times.
Trusting that my suggestions may be accepted and adopted by the
Authorities in the spirit in whioh they are tendered,
I remain yours leisurely, Briefless, Jun.
Never too Late.—Miss Kelly, the veteran Aotress, aged ninety-
three, has received, through the exertions of Mr. Chari.es Ke.vi. a
State grant of a hundred and fifty pounds. This would be a tetl
good case for a Benefit, eh, Benedick?

NEITHER RHYME NOR REASON:
Ob, Peomise of Mat and Perfobmamce of November at
the Globe.
The sources of literary ambition are proverbially obscure, and
it is scarcely worth while to inquire why the Laureate, who has
spent a lifetime in filling
the world with his verse,
should, at the eleventh
hour have oonoeived the
idea of emptying the Globe
with his prose. If there
oould be any donbt that he
hid not ouly done so, but
also had set himself to the
business with a right good-
will, the hearty and sym-
pathetic) jeers of 'the not
unkindly audience that
attended the first perform-
ance of his Promise the
other evening must have
settled the matter. Indeed, some of the Poet's own lines—or some-
thing like them—seemed to occur to everybody. Even his stauncheBt
admirers oould be heard in the lobbies between the Acts respectfully
quoting to each other,
"I hold it truth, that he wlio flings
His harp aside, to try the bones,
Will somehow find that paving-stones
Are levelled at his neatest things."
By the way, the Management might even now take a hint from a
rival establishment, and try this on a poster.
But to resume. The plot of the piece is simplicity itself. A
gentleman, who would be
described by Mr. Tebky as ,£S>3\
"Such a Dawg," comes down W^ i;'
from London in a pair of
new boots, and behaves in
the usual "Such-a-Dawg"
sort of a way to a village
maiden. After an interval
of six years, he again comes
down, and always comes
down heavily, but this time
in a light-coloured bioycle
suit and a large buckle. Thus
arrayed, he prepares to be-
have nobly to the aforesaid
maiden's sister. "Give him,"
says this Such-a-Dawg, as he
stands on a rustic bridge,
"twenty minutes, and she
shall be his,"—or words to
that effect. But, as there
was somebody coming, and
Maiden Number Two was
going, the calculating Dawg
didn't get his twenty minutes—[" Twenty Minutes with a Dawg "—
good name for a Farce]—and we did not have presented to us the
realisation of the well-known French companion pictures of the
"Meeting on the Narrow
Bridge." TheSadDawg's
conduot, however, hav-
ing shattered the health
of an old gentleman (the
father of the maidens
in question) to 'such an
extent that he has lost not
only his hearing and his
eyesight, but'even his eye

glasses, poetic justice is at
last let loose.
Taking the
of a pitchfork, it
has ineffectually pursued
him for some time, but it
ultimately brings him to
bay in the guise of a hop-
pole. Upon fully realising
the humour of this situa
tion, but with evidently a
lurking regret that there
are not more maidens of
this family to •ocquer, end a trifle vexed perhaps that he can't be

sneaks off with his tail between his legs, and probably returns to
London as he oame—on his bioycle.
If the talented Author had merely contented himself with working
out this pretty little idyl in some ordinary and unpretentious
fashion, there oould hardly have been any doubt about the result.
But he went further than this, and in some inspired moment
appears to have conceived the brilliant and happy idea of spicing
his whole story, from beginning to end, with the wildest and most
boisterous fun.
Not that his purpose was distinctly apparent on the first go off of
his piece in a Lincolnshire farm,—a capital "set," by the way; forth©
serious utterances of several gloomy rustics for a few moments filled
the house almost with awe. But matters soon brightened up when
Mr. IIkhma.n Vezis, The Dawg in the London-made boots already
referred to, came upon the scene in a green-pea-soup velvet coatee.
After a very few of his sentences, it became quite evident with what
a subtle and keen sense of humour he had been introduced into the
plot; and as, like a
sort of jovial Mac-
beth and Dogberry
rolled into one, he
with a rifle-bullet
Erecision, dropped
is good things
right into the mid-
dle of his audience,
they were fairly
convulsed by him;
and long before the
end of the First
Act the play was
going with a roar—
in tact, almost an
uproar. Had Lord
QrjEENSBEKUY been
there on the first
night, and made his
now historical
speech, and been
chucked out by Mr.
Kelly with a pitch-
fork, the right key might have been struck with this agricultural
instrument, and the sympathies of the audience might nave been
enlisted even for the wicked doings of the 8ad Dawg in the London-
made boots, represented by Mr. Heiijukn Vezin.
After this, there was no limit to the fun that followed. Surprise
succeeded surprise. The grim Rustics, full fifteen strong, whose
depressing conversation had so seriously compromised the opening
scene, were now utilised to the fullest extent. It turns out that
hey have been sitting up all night making hay, absolutely refusing
to go to bed till " the load goes home," which in this madly waggish
part of the country, it apparently does not do till about half-past
ten the next morning. Even when they have gone off to bed they
are heard by the audience
singing a chorus which be-
comes more and more feeble
as the Happy but Eccentric
Villagers reach their houses,
go to rest, continue the refrain
under the bed-clothes, and are
tucked up for the day, only to
pop up again occasionally
with another sudden burst of
chorus, which is continued by
fits and starts, apparently
with the sole object of inter-
rupting whatever may happen
to be going on on the stage.
The Sad Dawg in the London-
made boots now comes out in
a new line—quite an original
character we believe—as the
Comio Agnostic. What a
lovely advertising title for
a Music - Hall Celebrity I
"Every evening at eight-
thirty the Comio A gnostic in
his favourite song of ' When the Sparrows Twitter,' with chorus
and dance I"
The sly wink with which Mr. VEaar as the Comic Agnostio Dawg,
informs the audience, aside, that the Obituary Notice in the news-
paper, which he passes off on the simple sssthetio maiden (Mrs.
Bkknard Bkeee—very se-thetio and diaphanously thin, as Beere
which isn't Stout, should be) is "my father's death—not mine—
no matter—{wink)—a mere detail," would be worth twenty pounds
a week to the great Vakce.

doesn't think any Stick good enough
to beat such a Dawg.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Rich and raoy, too, is the vein of merriment in which, looking
precisely like what he did in the First Aot, he announces his convic-
tion that the beard he has grown on the Continent has disguised him.
All this is exoellent fooling; but when Mr. Kelly, who plays a rather
undeoided Farmer, with a force and robustness worthy of better
things, is seen pursuing him all over the three hundred acres of
Farmer Steer's property with a formidable and highly-polished pitoh-
fork, but never exactly coming up with him, the climax of practical
joking seemed to have been reached by the Laureate; and though it
was felt to be just as well that Mr. Vezin escaped the pitch-fork, it
was admitted on all hands that, in bo doing, he really missed the
only two points in the Piece.
Yet, full as are Acts One and Two of screamingly funny business,
Act Three, to the infinite credit of the Author, is quite equal to them.
And here the Scenio Artist determined to have his laugh along
with everybody else. The labourers who come to be paid in "the
Upper Hall in Steer's Farm" enter it by a staircase,—or, as the
Punster-Laureate has it, a steer-case—which, if it lead anywhere,
must take them directly on to the roof. But at this stage of the
proceedings it seems quite natural that they should get out of the
house in some such playful fashion. Indeed, it is almost with a
feeling akin to disappointment one has to record that a great oppor-
tunity is missed in Mr. Harold Edgar Vezin's last entrance. He
should certainly have come down the chimney.
However, with so much genuine pantomime go for the finish in
reserve, very possibly the Author knew what he was about. And
he was not at fault. He must have realised what depths of quiet
fun would be stirred when plaoing Mrs. Bebnabd Bkere, over the
dead body of Eva, he made her in so many words courteously request
Farmer Dobson and
the Comic Agnostic
"to consider them-
selves quite at home,
and not mind the
corpse, as she had a
few general remarks
to make that wouldn't
take her much more
than iive-and-twenty
minutes."
This capitally-con-
ceived and well-timed
bit of badinage, as
might have been ex-
pected, tickled the
audience immensely,
and it scarcely needed
the stealthy departure
of Mr. Harold Edoak
Vezin on a tour beyond " the furthest stile," to which destination
he is "personally conducted" by Mr. Kelly with a thundering
hop-pole, to warrant the despatoh of a telegram to Mr. Tennyson,
to the effect that there wasn't a dry eye in the house.
But there,—the matter really defies sober critioism, and, taking
his own charming lines from the bill, the story is soon told:—
The Town booked well for the opening night,
The Pit was full—an evident pull,
The Grand Old Man had a box of his own,
And Vezin behind said it looked all right.
And the Critics in front took an excellent tone.
There 's a chance for The Promise of May, of May,
There'« a chance for The Promise of May.
But a sly wink woke in the eye of the Town,
And a frivolous fit got hold of the Pit,
And Kelly a pitchfork, and Vezin a roar,
And the stock chaff followed the Curtain down;
And the Critics they did—as they've done before—
They slaughtered The Promise of May, of May,
They slaughtered The Promise of May!
The Laureate cannot write a playable play. But how is it that
Mr. Vezin, Mr. Kelly, and Mrs. Bernabd-Beere & Co. accepted
such a piece, or, having accepted it blindly and deafly,—without
hearing it read, we suppose,—how is it that they didn't see its
absurdities during the careful rehearsals that they must have
given it, and were not struck by its utterly unaramatio con-
struction and the feebleness of its dialogue? The Falcon at the
St. James's was saved by the acting; Queen Mary nothing could
save; The Cup was the success of Miss Ellen Tebby, Mr. Ibying, the
Scene-Painter, and the Stage Management. But the Promise of
May must be an Utter Frost, with, we are sorry to think, no Promise
to Pay in it; and nothing, except the spasmodic curiosity of the
Public to see what the Laureate can't do, can set this unfortunate
Humpty-Dumpty up again. Perhaps this will be the last attempt
for some little time to oome to get the scent of the hay across the

SAVED FROM THE SEA!
Respected Editor,
I have been out of town for the benefit of my health. This
surely is sufficient answer to your somewhat hastily-worded inquiries
as to why I have not been at the Promise of May nix nights running
to see if that drama " worked up "; why I did not go some time in
the dead of night to some sea-port, name unknown to you, to witness
the arrival of some Regiment—both number and territorial designa-
tion vaguely described by you as "the Something Somethingth,
which used to be What-do-you-oall-him's own Thingummies," from
Egypt; and why I have not yet finished that Christmas story, the
plot of which, when I unfolded it to you last July, you were good
enough to say was admirable. By the bye, as it made so great an
impression on you, perhaps you remember what the plot was, as I
have entirely forgotten it, and can't get to work.
I have been staying at Junosegate with an old and dear friend—
how old I didn't like to ask him, as he is a touchy man; how dear I
didn't know until he taught me two games of cards entitled
"Snoozleum" and "German Ecarte," pastimes which, if I may
introduoe them to your family circle, will, I am sure, be the means
of enabling you to while away the long winter evenings now upon
us with great profit to yourself, provided the circle plays on the
square. His letter of invitation was too tempting to be disregarded;
he desoribed himself as hypochondriacal and nipped to the last
degree, as one who shuddered at the thought of eating and drinking,
and trembled at the scent of tobacco; as a man who was so dull and
bored with life that he wished one who was still duller,' and a greater
bore than himself, to stay with him. He described the attractions
of the plaoe as being miserable, the weather vile, and declared that
he was only debarred from lying down and dying by the hope that
the recent gales would bring a shipwreck under his very nose. . That
settled me.
I have been passionately fond of shipwreoks all my life. Person-
ally my experiences have been small. Mainly consisting of running
a canoe a-ground on the Duke of Uucclkccii's lawn at Richmond
while the Thames was in flood, but there is hardly a printed wreck
with which I am not acquainted. Robinson Crusoe's mishap I know
by heart, and love, though I cannot agree with his condemnation of
the money he found in the Captain's drawer, as with it he could at
least have acquired on a desert island so accurate a knowledge of the
ohanoes of tossing as to have made him the envy of all he met on his
return to civilisation; the kindness of the wreck which befel the
Swiss Family Robinson cannot be too highly extolled, allowing that
estimable family as it did to acquire all the necessaries of life, such
as the starting price of the winner of the Shrewsbury Cup, the
latest photographs of Connie Gilchrist and the gag of Arthur
Roberts,
What have you done with your gay rosebud,
What has become of your studs so neat':
I quote from a naturally bad memory, rendered worse by a mag-
num or two of Boy—and the Wreck of the Orosvenor is as familiar
to me as the fact that I have not paid, for over twelve months,
my subscription to the Library in connection with the Gallery of
that ilk.
I went to investigate. All was as my friend described. He was
dreary and dull. The amusements of the place were ghastly. The
weather was vile, and one morning when we looked out of window
there was a wreck on the sands!
I don't mind owning that if I hadn't been told by an old friend,
whom I have never known to tell a falsehood which he didn't stick
to afterwards through thick and thin, that it was a wreck, I should
not have known, for it looked uncommonly like any other vessel not
making rapid progress through the sea. The presence of a tug, too,
destroyed the romance, and gave a sort of holiday flavour—a kind
of The Tuggs at Ramsgate air—to the soene, not at all in keeping
with my ideas. And the lifeboat, too, cruised in an aimless manner
round the wreck. My friend said it was bargaining with the ship-
wrecked mariners. "They all do it, you know," he explained.
"They put out to a wreck, and say, ' Hullo, you Johnnies! how
much ahead to be put ashore?' and the Johnnies say half-a-
sovereign, and the lifeboat men say they '11 see them drowned first,
until they get a good offer, and then they bring them in."
As I said before, I have never known my friend to offend out-
rageously against one truth, without having several violations of
other veracities to support himself with.

We grew tired of looking at the wreck. I didn't want to grow
tired. I wanted to gaze with a moist eye and a beating heart, and
contemplate the sufferings of the wretched sailors, while I was
having my breakfast, but, nevertheless, I grew tired of it. We went
into the town. There was in reality nothiDg more than a stiff breeze;
but, there being a wreck in Bight, the inhabitants of Junosegate were
acting up to it. They acted up to it by crouching under the lee of
walls where they could see nothing. A town all Chevy Slimes all
turned marine was Junoseville that morning. Meanwhile strangers
who weren't cast for the piece walked about totally unconcerned.
This evidently annoyed the inhabitants who were playing at
Siroccos, but they said nothing. My friend took me to his Club, and
we read the papers. This did not take us long, as my friend says
that if there are two things that make him ill, one is Egypt, and the
other is Cloture; but when he came out, the wreck was a wreck.
The hull of the ship had disappeared, waves were breaking over the
rigging, and the masts were leaning over the sides to the sea, just as
you or 1 might lean over the side—but no matter. The prosaic tug
had disappeared. The lifeboat was entering the harbour with the
orew on board.
"All saved!" Such were the words that went through the
crowd assembled on the pier, like an electric shock. We were soon
amongst that crowd. Now I was in my element. Now I knew who
was which. I had not read shipwrecks for nothing. Now I should
see the Curate, with the hectic flush on his cheek, whose High Church
proclivities had offended the simple sailors, show the sterling pluck
within him, and win all hearts, and obtain large congregations in
the future, and make a good thing out of the collections; now I
should see the old Doctor, excited yet calm, with all the appliances
of science by his side, ready to treat the half-drowned men for
typhoid fever or inoipient scarlatina, or both combined; now I should
see the Squire dash down on his horse, and offer a hundred pounds to
any man who would take a rope where it wasn't wanted; now I
should see large-limbed sailors refusing gold, and plunging into the
spray, and carrying ropes where they oouldn't be of the slightest
use; now 1 should see the Landlord of the old-fashioned sea-port inn,
the "Steward and Basin," proffer, at his own expense, to the drip-
ping heroes bumpers of curious old claret, which no one would pur-
chase under any pretence whatsoever; now I should see the men
who were standing round awestruck and fearful for a while, wax
mad and joyous at the rescue, and cheer lustily their own townsmen;
now I should see the women dry their eyes, and rush forward with
true womanly gentleness and zeal to be of any assistance to the cold,
numbed strangers; and now I should see the strangers themselves,
on touching shore, sink on their knees, and offer up thanksgivings
for their escape from the jaws of death I
The lifeboat reached the pier. Ten men were landed. The sym-
pathetic crowd formed into a lane to allow the shipwrecked to
pass! The first four put their hands in their pockets, and assumed
the cheerful happy air of juvenile criminals who had just been
detected in some very stupid act of petty larceny. The fifth oarried
in his arms a black dog, a very feeble dog, a totally idiotio animal,
a beast that would bite his own master to the bone, and look upon a
burglar's revolver as a toy bought for his own amusement. The
sixth carried a tall hat in his hands. I didn't wait for the others.
I didn't want to see them. They probably were provided with
buckram shirts and gardenias, and socks all over spots, and shoes all
over bows, and were prepared to "mash" at the Gaiety. But 1
didn't see them. I turned to the crowd, eagerly and sympatheti-
cally, and with true English courtesy, calling out, "See here, Bill,
'ere's a cove looks blooming bad!" and "Hain't you been sick
neither?" "Shall I carry your portmantiar, or will yer 'ave a
homnibus for your luggidgef" and other expressions kindly, if
roughly put. The Landlord wasn't present, the Doctor was invisible,
the Squire was as non est as his nature allowed him to be, and the
Curate never came. We followed the crowd. The shipwrecked men
were taken to the Curate's simple lodgings f No. To the Squire's

BUBBLE.
In spite of the Wilde San-
flower's devotion, the worship of
the " Lillie " seems to be on the
decline in America. The Two
Ornaments of the Peaks' Soap Ad-
vertisements, Lillie and Pattie
[0 Adelina! to think that any-
one could have dared to pit her-
self, and stall herself too, against
yon!], started fair; but if the New
York accounts are to be trusted
—for which see the Standard of
last Wednesday and Thursday—
Adelina is first, and Lillie no-
where. When the Lillie first
appeared, Mr. Punch did not join
in the chorus of gush and fulsome
laudation, but told the Lady fairly
and squarely that she was as yet
only a mere amateur, and not
much as that. "My face is my
fortune, Sir, she said," and she
could not be blamed for trusting
to all that Nature had done for
her, the notoriety that photo-
graphic speculators had given
her, and the devotion of inju-
dicious but kindly and influential
friends, in order to make as much
money as she could in the shortest
Eossible time on the Stage. Per-
aps now Lillie will Bend for
some more cakes of Soap from
Mr. Pears-as the Lillie does
not appear likely to get any of it
from the Americans—and then—
(" Abby" Thought!)—wash her
hands of the whole affair, and
give up playacting. By the way,
when she returns to England,
should she recollect the very
straightforward article, and the
telegram from New York, that
appeared in the journal above re-
ferred to, there isevery chance that
while on the Stage she will show
herself "quiteuptothe Standard."
SCHOOLBOREDIANA.
(From a Correspondent.)
On Friday evening, Doctor Goahed addressed a crowded meeting
at the Squattersea Vestry Hall. The worthy Doctor seeks to be re-
elected to a seat on the School Board, a position which he has
occupied, with equal satisfaction to himself and the Board, for the
last six years. In an eloquent speeoh of upwards of an hour, he
informed his audience of the marvellous success which had crowned
the efforts of the Board. He spoke of the millions that had been
spent in the past, and of the millions that were to be spent in the
future in carrying out the great work of education. Only ignorant
people complained of the cost, for the cost would be repaid a hun-
dredfold in the universal spread of intelligence, and the universal
disappearance of crime. The learned Doctor even went_ so far as to
predict that in a very few years we should be able to dispense with
the Police, to shut up all the Police-Courts except Bow Street, and
even to abolish the Old Bailey, and turn Newgate into a Coffee
Palace. The latter sentiment was loudly applauded by a knot of
young men in the gallery, who probably had some practical acquaint-
ance with that well-known locality.
Before resuming his seat, the worthy Doctor said he would gladly
answer any question that the Ratepayers desired to put to him.
A Ratepayer here rose, and asked how much money it was proposed
to spend next year.
The Doctor. I cannot say. But what does it matter? In a case
like this a million or two more or less
Another Ratepayer. Less, if you please, Doctor. Now, another
question. How many Superintendents and School Visitors are in
the pay of the Board, and what do their salaries come to P
The Doctor. I really don't know. These are pure matters of
detail.
Another Ratepayer. Can you tell us how many School Board
prosecutions there have been last year P
The Doctor. I cannot tell.
Another Ratepayer. How many people have been sold up or sent
to prison by the School Board in t he past year P
The Doctor. I really don't know.
Another Ratepayer. What was the cost of furnishing the Shaftes-
bury f
The Doctor. I don't know.
[I here overheard a man behind me say to his neighbour, "I 'm
blowed if this 'ere 'cove knows anythink. He can talk like a book,
that'sail!'']
Another Ratepayer. Do you go for higher education P
The Doctor. No, Sir. 1 go for the highest education. In my
opinion, no education can be too high, and no oost can be too great
to attain it.
My friend behind me here irreverently observed to his friend that
the Doctor was an ass. But he was evidently in the minority, for
no more questions were asked, and a Gentleman in the body of the
hall rose and said, that as the worthy Doctor had so dearly ex-
plained his views, and answered every question in so satisfactory a
manner, that he was a fit and proper person to represent the rate-
payers on the Sohool Board. The Motion was seconded, and carried
by aoolamation.

PARLIAMENTARY NURSERY RHYME.
(in the Coldecottian Christmas Style.)
Monday Night, Nov. 13.—" I wouldn't have minded, Dhummoxd,
if it had been an Englishman, a "Welshman, or, of course, an Irish-
man. Bat, good G OR8T I to think of me being made the subjeot of a
joke by a Scotchman 1"
It was Randolph who spoke. They were leading him gently
forth after his little tumble on a Motion for Adjournment. Cer-
tainly nothing neater or more complete done in the House of Com-
mons for some years. As Randolph says, all the more bitter since
it was a Scotchman who did it.
Randolph had come down determined to move the Adjournment
at whatever cost. _ Opportunity came; Randolph on his legs:
Ministerialists groaning, and everything in best possible form; when
here comes this Scotchman with his elaborate and only too-successful
joke, and bowls Randolph clean off his legs. Remembers now he did
a year ago make Cameron so wild, by replacing in his own name a
Resolution he had withdrawn so that he might move Adjournment.
Thought it was excellent joke at the time, but doesn't look so well
from this new aspect.
"It's the cool, canny cunning I can't stand," Randolph mur-
mured as they latd him down in the Library, and loosed his shirt-
collar ._ "The diabolical duplicity of a man to go and take my
Question, turn it into a Resolution, place it on the paper, and then
hide in ambush till 1 got up! It 'a monstrous! Massacre of Glencoe
quite a straighforward proceeding to this. Macbeth an honest host,
in whose castle any man might dine and sleep. And to think of
Cameron going about all this time with this black secret in his
bosom! Daresay he went to kirk yesterday, and sucked pepper-
mints through the sermon, as they do in Edinburgh and Glasgow.
Drcmmond, beware of a Scotchman. He has not only taken in
Gorst, which, as you say, isn't much, the old chappie not being
nearly so subtle as he looks: but he's taken Me in. Flodden Field
is avenged, and you may wipe out Falkirk and Preston from
History's page."
_ Was, in truth, rather a sell for Randolph, the more complete
since it was exaot reproduction of his own innocent diversions at the
expense of a blameless man. House chuckled immensely. Quite a
stream of callers to the Library, where they had laid Randolph.
Commiseration on every face, and kind inquiries on every tongue.
But Randolph knew that they only came to mock him, and genially
snapped at them.
Business dont.—The Second Resolution moved. Randolph forms
a first resolution to Beware of Scotchmen.
Tuesday Night.—Ministry always being reconstructed. To-night,
report begins with Lord Selborne, accepts his resignation of Lord
Chancellorship, and puts Sir William Harcotjrt in bis place. Great
excitement in Commons, and some movement amongst Lords. Half-
a-dozen come down, take their seats in their Gallery, and glare
defiantly on the House. Lord Stbatheden-and-Campbell publioly
goes to sleep on the top Benoh, to show what he thinks of the House
of Commons.
"Heard something the other night about'protests of the Lords,'"
Bobby Spencer says. "By Jove, there'll be another and a hotter
one!"
Bonny a little torn between conflicting interests. Family connec-
tions and aristocratic tendencies draw him towards the Lords. A
sense of responsibility and a feeling of sympathy with Gladstone's
policy lead him to acquiesce in whatever proposition Premier may
make.
"Always have a kindly feeling towards a man you've been
fighting with," the generous youth says. "The old man and I have
had grand struggles in the collar line. He beat me, I own. With
his usual downiness, no conditions of style being agreed on, he went
in for the mainsail pattern, whioh you can hoist up to your eye-
brows. I took to the dog-collar, and you cannot get that above your
chin, donchaknow, however you try. But I bear no malice, and, if
Gladstone thinks it for the good of the State, will sacrifice my
noble relatives in the other House."
Edward Clarke, accustomed to see through the milestones, says
"This is new development of Gladstone's well-known intention to
destroy upper branch of Legislature. He finds he can't bring about
their abolition in the ordinary way," E. C. continues, smiting the
palm of his left hand with the two forefingers of his right, "so he

takes them in flank, and he's quite right in his judgment. The
House of Lords will abolish itself -when it hears that it is to have
Harcoitrt as President."
Business done.— More talk on the Second Rule of Procedure.
Wednesday.—Stafford Northcote absent to-day. Hear he's ill,
and is going to tear himself for awhile from Randolph's company.
Don't wonder at this: but everybody sorry to hear of the illness.
Few men in the House for whom there is wider or stronger personal
regard than for Sir Stafford. A kinder, truer-hearted, or more
upright English Gentleman does not sit in Parliament. Hope he'll
get through the Bay of Biscay comfortably, and happily into the blue
Mediterranean Sea.
"We shall, I suppose, be still grinding away at Procedure Rules.
How pleasant for Sir Stafford seated on the poop of the Pandora—
suppose it's got a poop. W. H. Ssttth wasn't Lord of the Admiralty
for nothing, and wouldn't think of going to sea without a poop—
reading his morning paper, and finding that Randolph has put on
another hilf-hundred Amendments, that he had another row last
nieht with Gladstone, and that he's worrying the life out of Sir
Richard Cross. Business done.—Still harping on Third Resolution.
Thursday Night—Whit with reviews of troops in baok-yards,
and opening of Law Courts in the Strand, we are living in a round
of dissipation that begins to tell upon our elders. Merciful dispo-
sition on the part of Authorities to narrow as much as possible limits
of danger.
"House of Commons," Mr. Gregory growls, "just like a lot of
sohoolbovs or a nursery of children. If there's a raree-show going
on anywhere, always want to know ' what accommodation is provided
for Members of this House.' Why should this House have special
accommodation? Its business is to make" laws, not to go to raree-
shows, /never went to a show in my life; don't want to, and don't
mean to; and see how jolly I am!"
Mr. Sbtaw-Lefevre, having set apart a stand in the back-yard,
so that Members may see the Review, aocompanied " either by their
wives or a lady," found himself overwhelmed with applications.
Seems all Members who have not a wife, know a Lady. _ Every
prosoect of the baok-yard being full of Legislators and Ladies, and
British Army shouldered out.
Accommodation still more limited at opening of New Law Courts.
Happy thought occurred to First Commissioner of Works. Make them
go in levee dress. This narrows scope of acceptance, and not likely
to be a crush. Joseph Gillis says he certainly knows a Lady, but
he's " not going to put on a leevi'e dress," so if anyone wants his
ticket they may have it.
Getting on a little faster with the Rules. Found out their use
to-night. Adjournment moved and speeches made at usual length.
G rnsox on his feet talking on all subjects hut that of Motion. Dill-
wvn lving in wait. Suddenly pounces down on him. Third Rule
says Member speaking on Motion for Adjournment must confine
himself to suoh Motion. Puts it to Speaxer whether Gibson is so
doing. Bound to say he's not says Speaker. So Gibson sits
down and business moves again. G.'s discomfiture softened' by
Randolph, who dances round him, pulls faces at him, pokes him
playfully in the ribs, ories "Ha, ha!" and otherwise soothes his
Right Hon. friend. Business done.—Passed Rule Five.
Friday Night.—Curious how lively " The Man from Shropshire"
is on a Friday night. Seems to get wound up during the week, and
goes off with much agitation of mechanism on last night of it. To-
night, a propos of nothing, quotes the maxim that at forty a man is
either a Doctor or a Fool. General rush for Dod to look up particu-
lars personal to Stanlet Leighton. Find he's over forty, and cer-
tainly is not a Doctor. Business done.—Rule Eight under discussion.
REPORTS OF OUR OWN CITY QOMMISSIONER.
No. I.—Livery Companies.
Mr. PrmcH, Sra,
In reply to your rather peremptory suggestion that I should
wake up and finish my Reports on the various matters entrusted to
me, and on which I have taken so large an amount of important
evidence. I have Woke up accordingly, and now send you Report
No. 1, which relates to the present condition of those puzzling Insti-
tutions known as the Guilds or Livery Companies of the City
of London.
I may as well state my initial difficulty in dealing impartially
with these valuable creations of the Past.
Ever since it became known that I was the fortunate individual
selected by you to inquire into their present condition, I have been
overwhelmed with such an amount of more than princely hospitality,
that not only has my weight increased from 11.4 to 12.2, but, I am
fain to confess, that the first impressions I received from the calm
sober business-like evidence that was presented to me in camera,
have been considerably modified. I have broken bread, and some-
thing else, with the, far from crusty, Bakers. I have lunched
copiously with the merry Mercers, and partaken freely of their
matchless Madeira. I have dined sumptuously with the clever
Cooks, with the honest Fishmongers, with the plucky Poulterers,
with the burly Butchers and with the friendly Fruiterers. _
I have done penance with the virtuous Vintners at their Lenten
Festival, at which they religiously draw the line at Comic Songs, I
have joined the jovial Joiners at tneir Irish Festival when they print
their menus on green paper, have potatoes at every course, and
plenty of buttered Toasts after dinner in order to encourage Irish
produce. I have been remarkably well fitted by the Merchant
Tailors by being invited to their Feast of Love with the sociable
Skinners, held annually in commemoration of their fierce fight in
Cheapside in the year 1304, when two Skinners and eighteen Tailors
being left dead on the pavement, it was considered a drawn battle.
But. Sir, though I shall never. I hope, be guilty of the shameful
vice of ingratitude, I trust that I have risen superior to any weak-
ness that twelve months' dissipation might have engendered in a
weaker or younger vessel.
And now to my difficult task.
These kindly and hospitable Institutions were many of them
founded in the reign of Queen Elizabeth of pious memory, but
some are of a much earlier date.
There must have been nearly a hundred of them at one time, as
the Carmen stood eighty-ninth in the list, but Time, with his
destructive hand, has reduced the number to seventy-four.
One is not surprised to find that the Mercers stand first on the
roll, one of their productions, aprons, having been in demand at a
very early date.
The last Company that expired of inanition, its last member being,
as is only natural, the Clerk, was the Paviors, their stony hearts
being probably broken by the advent of asphalte.
My greatest difficulty has, of course, been to obtain a reasonably
fair estimate of the amount of the property of the whole of the
Guilds; but, from what I have gathered from their communicative
Officers in the confiding hours of after-dinner, and from a variety of
other sources, some of them of very peculiar character, I arrive at
the conclusion that their annual income is, in round figures,
£1,882,000. This noble revenue capitalised at, say. twenty-five
years' purchase, produces the magnificent sum of £47,050.000!
I am informed, on excellent authority, that there are five of Her
Majesty's subjects who have between them an annual income equal
in amount to that above stated, and I should like to know whether
they can render so good an acoount of its appropriation as that which
I am now about to describe.
The same accurate and varied information that has enabled me to
ascertain the exact amount of the annual income of the guiltless
Guilds, also enables me to furnish an exact account of how they
expend it.
Perhaps none will be more astonished at the extraordinary revela-
tion I am about to make than the members of the Guilds themselves,
but when Mr. Punch issues a Royal Commission under his sign
manual, no amount of secret information he obtains and reveals
should surprise anyone.
I divide their expenditure into four parts:—
1. Education, in which I include some of the
noblest foundations in this grand old country of
ours £587,506 6 8
2. Philanthropy, including countless magnificent
institutions for the relief of suffering^ humanity,
and boundless contributions to other institutions
for the relief of every evil that flesh is heir to . £659,413 IS 4
3. Management, including princely fees to
Masters and Wardens and Courts of Assistants,
satisfactory fees to contented Liverymen, hand-
some salaries to highly talented Officers, liberal
salaries, to competent Clerks, and certainly very
sufficient salaries to numerous gorgeous but not
over-worked Beadles ...... £297,218 6 8
And last, but not by any means least, in our
fond love, the fine Christian virtue of Hospitality,
including everything that can by possibility
included under that generous and noble name
£337,801 13 4
£1,882,000 0 0

Very suggestive name, only that it sounds a little too
like "When Johnny comes marching home!" But
"Tip" is certainly associated with Papa's return home
at Christmas-time: "Tap " evidently refers to the right
tap of port, and "Toe" to the subsequent gout; but
whether this be a true account of the contents or not can
only be solved by the purchase and perusal of the book.

Most welcome to young and old. In spite of the translator's
name, these stories can never pall upon us.

that the American children are brought up on the same

generations in the Old Country. We have not met with
any purely American Nursery Rhymes. Surely their

I tittnk, that power the Tories crave,
With impotent endeavour,
Though Stafford is serene and suave,
And Randolph'rude and clever.
I think my thoughts upon the throng
Fall sweet as dews on Hermon:
And that I '11 set them to a song,
Though apter at a sermon.
I think that some are men of parts,
Whilst some are vulgar fractions,
That some are good at Liberal arts,
And some at liberal actions;
I think that Habcourt—with a bit—
Is not so bad a neighbour,
Though one who at, and with his wit,
Will labour, and belabour.
I think that HABTrNGTON is wise,
And Bright austerely moral;
Fawcett Bees more than some with eyes,
And Fobsteb 'a sage, though sorrel;
That Gbanville has a feline pat,
Which much his foemen troubles,
So soft they scarce know what he's at
Until it pricks their bubbles.
I think the Cloture yields a chanoe
Of flooring our upsetters;
That they talk rubbish, or romance,
Who prate of gags and fetters;
I think that Freedom's truest friend
Is he who helps to scatter
The cackling flock whose aim and end
Is chatter, chatter, chatter.
I think the Tories want a cry,
But kicking o'er the traces,
With borrowed cant of " Liberty"
Won't help them to our places.
I think that Salisbury 's hardly wise,
And Richmond scarcely funny,
That with their Party's advent flies
Bull's honour—and his money,
I think the Rads. too apt to rave
(Much like inverted Tories),
Sweetness and light and manners suave
Are scarce their crowning glories;
That Wtlfrid is too prompt to ban,
Passmorf. to play the Partlet;
"Whilst Cowbn hates the Grand Old Man
As much as Ashmead-Bartlett.
I think that, thanks to Gbanyiixe 'cute,
And thanks to Duffebin clever,
We 've distanced France beyond pursuit,
And floored tho Turk for ever.
I think Arabi's on his back,
And though the law must shake him,
I 'm not quite sure he 's quite bo black
As the Bondholders make him.
I think that Leadership's a play,
Now Entrance and now Exit,
When fortune smiles upon it, gay<
And sad when failures vex it,
Like vessels in a seaway rough,
To pitches prone and tosses;
With little peace, pain quantum stiff.—
A game of noughts and crosses.
I think the world, though hard it b#.
Affords one constant pleasure,—
The felling of the forest tree
When one has health and leisure,
One volume—Hornet—nil delight-,
One comrade—a ripo scholar. .
One ohoioe—when «u oun't talk, to write.
One ease—a looae ehirt-oollar.
I think old Chieftains feel o'ertried,
When years at last have found them:
New frienda-though loyal-at their side,
New foos—though little—round them.
I think that thoso who long have fought
Grow weary, though unshrinking; ^
I think- that now you know my thoujcut,
And that 1 'm tired of thinking.

PUNCH'S FANCY PORTRAITS.-No. 112.

SIR HENRY HAWKINS,
Tab Adviser of thb Police, and the Mister of ths Hard Sen-
tences. He was recently down on the Threateniko-Royalty-
Letter-Writbr "like a Bird!"
A TIP TO TEETOTALLERS.
He. A. M. Sullivan is wel-
come back from the United
States and to the dinner the
Irish Members off er him. This
recognition is as creditable to
them as his work in America
is honourable to him. Unlike
some orators from Ireland ad-
dressing Irish-Americans, Mr.
Sullivan dared to state the
truth, though unpalatable.
For the first time since their
exile began the Irish in Ame-
rica heard a kind word for
Mr. Gladstone, and a vindi-
cation of the good effected by
the Land Act. The experi-
ment was a bold one, but it
succeeded; and in the rela-
tions of the two countries per-
manent good is likely to result
from Mr. Sullivan's visit.
This said with reference to
the public aspect of the tour,
we regret to find evidence of
demoralisation in private cha-
racter. In the New Orleans
Picayune, whioh gives an
account of Mr. Sullivan's
enthusiastic reception in the
Southern City, and of the
brave, honest words spoken by
him, the following is written:—
"At the invitation of Mr. Dono-
van, the visitors tipped glasses
with Mr. Sullivan, and drank
to an eloquent sentiment by Mr.
Semmf.s : ' Louisiana and Ireland,
may they ever prosper under
Ilomo-Ituie.'"
This, Sir Wilfrid Lawson
will doubtless think, is co-
quetting with the enemy. _ A
man cannot go "tipping
glasses" without running a
risk of becoming tipsy him-
self, and Mr. Sullivan was,
at least when he left Eng-
land, the foremost champion

TEIAL BY JUDGE.
Scene—Interior of a Court of Law during the hearing of a libel
case, which has had an unprecedented run of any number of
days, Mr. Baron Muddlesoxb presiding on the Bench, sur-
rounded by plaster-casts and rough sketches, looking, at first
sight, like a forensic Auctioneer entrusted with the sale of the
bankrupt stock of a Shopkeeper in the Easton Road. Members
of the Junior Bar in odd corners, having been ousted by Ladies
(chiefly knitting) who have annexed their places. In one odd
earner Statue of " Eee before the Fall," or some other female
in similar costume, appealing to the skylight for justice on
behalf of wigged but seatless Members of the Briefless Brigade
who surround her. Jury more or less bored in one box. Foreign
Witness more or less defiant in another box. Representatives of
the _ Press, more or less confused, in a third box. Counsel for
Plaintiff and Defendant professionally antagonistic. Weary
Usher in attendance.
Mr. Baron Muddlesome (courteously). One moment, if you please.
(Opens note-book, and then regards vacant places on the Bench, to
see if room has been left for expected Duchesses. Is satisfied on
finding that distinguished Visitors of the less illustrious sort have
been accommodated with seats so near the Jury that they look like
honorary members of that body.) And now, Mr. Bustle, we will
continue the discussion of that point we left unsolved last night.
Counsel for Defendant. With Your LudBhip's favour, what point?
Mr. Baron Muddlesome (stroking his chin, smiling at the Jury,
and caressing his nose). What point? Allow me—let me see. I
wiU refer to my Notes. (Long pause'during which his Lordship
goes through a number of pages of his own Notes, which seem to
cause him extreme surprise and confusion.) Ah! here it is! I
would merely point out that unless the Witness explains what he
means by calling Antwerp, er—(with courteously explanatory bow
to Jury)—Ongvayrs, whioh is the French equivalent-a port, it wiU
be open to observation—(smiles, frowns, waves his hand, and bows)
—when I oome to the summing-up.
Counsel for_ Defendant (sharply). I beg your pardon, your Lud-
ship; but, with your LudBhip's concent, I beg to say that the
Witness made use of no such expression.
Mr. Baron Muddlesome (distressed). You think not P Now, let
me clear my mind. (Caresses his nose, and dives once more into hi*
Notes.) I have it distinctly written here that the Witness on the
Quartrer der Julee—(to the Jury, with a smile)—in English, the
Fourth of July—the Witness said he delivered the sketch to the
Plaintiff. Eh t (Smiles, looks at Jury, and then at the Counsel.
Counsel for Defendant. With your Ludship's permission, what
sketch?
Mr. Baron Muddlesome (waving his hand to Counsel). One
moment, if you please. I am at present disposing of another matter.
(Has a long whispered conversation with Official,—then aloud.) Oh,
certainly 1 Let Her Grace oome on to the Bench immediately. (A Lady
is introduced. His Lordship treats her with extreme courtesy. Turning
to Counsel rather angrily.) And now, Mr. Bustle, we are waiting
for you? [Smiles at Lady, and waves his hand to Jury.
Counsel for Defendant (sharply). I am at your Ludship's
disposal!
Mr. Baron Muddlesome (confused). I beg your pardon. One
moment; I will refer to my Notes.
Counsel for Plaintiff. I hive no wish to intervene in this discus-
sion, but might I ask, with all respect to your Ludship, what arc we
all talking about? [Laughter, which is suppressed by weary Usher.

Counsel for Defendant (severely). With profound respect, I must
really object to your Ludship's exclamation. It is the opinion of both
myself and my learned friends, that your Ludship (if I may say so
with the profoundeet respeot) had—if it pleases your Ludship—no
right to say " No I"
Mr. Baron Muddlesome (pained). I beg your pardon, Mr. Bustle,
I did not say " No."
Counsel for Defendant (still more severely). With the profoundest
respeot to your Ludship, several of my learned friends, with whom
I have the pleasure to be associated in this case, heard you.
Mr. Baron Muddlesome (anxiously). There must surely be some
mistake. However, if you will give me time I will refer to my Notes.
(Dives into his book, and, after half-an-hour,s hard search, comes
up more distressed than ever). I thank you, Mr. Bustle, you are
quite right, I can find no record on my Notes that I did say "No." If
you please, Sir Hardt, we will continue the cross-examination.
Cross-Examination continued.
Defiant Foreign Witness. I did give him sixteen pounds.
Mr. Baron Muddlesome. You mean " Quartrer 8ong Fronk "—(to
Jury)—tow hundred franks in English, Gentlemen. I will explain
this to you. (Leaves Bench and goes up to Jury-box, where he
delivers a long and somewhat confused Lecture on the French

manufactured; graver, a graw,—I should say, an engraving. You
see it is Frenoh, Gentlemen. But if you allow me a minute or eo I
will refer to my Notes. (Once more dives into his book. Counsel
smile and continue the cross-examination.)
Counsel for the Plaintiff (suddenly). I object to my learned friend
holding up a diary in full view of tie Witness.
Junior Counsel for the Defendant (springing up, and making the
most of his chance in the absence of hit leader). I do not feel that my
conduct is open to any observation. I am merely doing my duty,
and allow me to say, in the face of this Court, that the man who
would treat a Witness in that box in any way save that of kindness
is unworthy of the name of a British Barrister. (Loud applause,
which is immediately suppressed.) I appeal to the Judge and to the
Jury! [Renewed applause.
Mr. Baron Muddlesome (suddenly discovering that a stuff-gown
man is speaking). Dear me, Mr. Slavet, you surely forget that it is
my duty to make observations on your conduct. If / had felt called
upon to interfere, I should have done so, and not the Jury. ( With
a bow to those worthies.) I am sure, Gentlemen, you will see the
necessity of the discipline.
[Smiles apologetically to Ladies on Bench, as if regretting the
necessity for alarming them by his severity, and resumes
study of Note-Book.
Counsel for Plaintiff (to Defiant Foreign Witness, who looks as if
he had come to the last stage but one of a Turkish Bath). Thank you.
[Sits down.
Mr. Baron Muddlesome. I think this will be an appropriate
pause for an adjournment. (Stroking his chin.) And I may add
that, if my social duties admit of the sacrifice (exchanges salutations
with the Ladies on the Bench), I will, during the recess, look into
my Notes.
[All stand up, and His Lordship courteously bows himself out of
Court, amidst great and general rejoicing.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A HOPE-FUL DRAMA.
Love and Money, a melodrama in five Acts, by Messrs. Charles
Reade and Henry Pettitt, is thoroughly suited to the Adelphi,
and is so well constructed, that, from the commencement to the finish,
the story being so clearly told in action, there is scarcely any neces-
sity for dialogue. There are, it is true, some few important details
which would puzzle even Mr. Johnnie D'Auban or the Martinettis


'JVn

Nearer and Dearer, or, Father and Father! A ballet d'action in the Hope-ra.
to express in pantomime; as, for instance, where Walter Clifford
discovers that Miss Lucy Monkton is not the sister but the mistress
of Leonard Monkton, and is, in fact, a Miss Fast-and-Loosey
Monkton. We were delighted that this name was not spelt with a
"c," or the Adelphi would for ever have loBt the valuable patronage
of the distinguished City official without whose signature the Cor-
poration documents would be dead letters,
Leonard Monkton, though played by a Lillt—not the Jersey
one—is the most diabolical
young scoundrel, yet of
Buch quick touch-and-go
activity, that he executes
his own nefarious designs
of extracting marked notes
from the caisse, of hiding
them and a few other
evidences of guilt in
somebody else's {Walter
Clifford's) pocket with a
liveliness of manner, and
a true relish of the prac-
tical joke he is playing on
his fellow-clerk; so that
were Mr. Mallandaine's
music to enter more tho-
roughly than it does into
the pantomimic spirit of
these situations, the house, instead of merely tittering, would be as
convulsed with laughter as is a Criterion audience when Mr. Wynd-
u a m conceals a puppy in his friend's coat-tails, secretes compromising
letters in a lady's workbox, and hides a few
female friends in those convenient cupboards
and aide-rooms which could only be planned by
a Palais Royal architect. What draughts there
must be in those houses where these farces take
place!
Mr. Bartley's Office, in Act I., is no exception
to the Palais Royal rule, for there is a huge
window looking on to the river, a street-door,
apparently open to all comers, another huge
window with a pigeon-hole in it (like the place
where the railway-tickets are issued), behind
whioh the Mephistophelian Light Comedian sits
and listens, and besides the "safe"-door—which
is as undeserving of this epithet as it well can
be—and a couple more doors into private apart-
ments, there is another door at the back with a
glass window, where more listening is done—not
this time by the Villain, but by the Hero,
William Hove, Mr. Clynds, who, if he hears
no good of himself, hears a great deal of bad
about other people. William Hope, in this Act,
appears as a sort of vagabond Paul Pry; he
rushes into .the Office, unknown, uninvited, and
unwelcome. Nobody is called to turn him out,
so forthwith Hope tells a flattering tale about himself, tells, in fact,
several flattering tales, is rebuffed by Bad Bartley about seven or
eight times, when, still as Paul Pry, Hope hopes he doesn't intrude,

The Eyder Dis-
mountcd; or, The

Colonel.
hurries off, and before Bad Bartleyhas time to resume his soliloquy,
Hope is back again, is rebuffed again, "offs it" with an apology, and
returns before it ever occurs to the wicked old Buffer—or Rebuffer,
as he is in this scene—to look the front-door and Bhut out Hope.
But Hope's little daughter is starving—(he himself looks as com-
fortably fed and cared for as need be)—but while there's life there's
Hope, and so he pops off and pops back again, repeating his " many
happy returns," until he too seems inclined to imitate the light
Criterion comedians, but, thinking better of it, bursts into pathos,
and is engaged by Bartley the Rebuffer in the capacity of spy on the
premises.
It should all have been arranged as a ballet, and Maitre Alfred
Thompson and D'Auban been associated with Messrs. Reade and
Pettitt. How superlatively good this Aot would then have been
may be at once seen by the entry of Mr. Ryder as Colonel Clifford,
who has a march past the audience (which is his saluting point), to
the inspiriting tune of the "British Grenadiers;" and if he had
only come in playing

"The Humorous Lovers"—Comic Duet.
My Juliar! my Juliar!" and "Bracelets
indeed! I'm going to do without 'em."
the air himself on a
penny whistlewith one
hand, and beating a small
drum with the other, the
success of the pieoe would
have been assured what-
ever else might have hap-
pened afterwards, and
there could not have been
any excuse for a change
of bill at Christmas.
The policeman is brought
on in this Scene too, and
the words, "See what
I 've found," come quite
naturally when the notes
are detected in the right
person's pocket after all
— a clever contrivance and sharp denoument which brings down the
Curtain, and the House.
The name of Clifford perhaps suggested that of Julia, and having
got these two, the idea of the Modus and Helen scene seems to have
struck Messrs. Reade and Pettitt, who have given us, in Julia
Clifford and Percy Fitzroy, a couple of characters whom they style
"the humorous lovers,"—though they seem to be the ill-humorous
lovers, as they are always quarrelling.
Miss Sophie Eyre is a very handsome Julia. There's something
about Julia which is werry peculiar, and that is, that her acting
appears to be modelled on Mrs. John Wood's style, and reminds us
occasionally of Miss Kate Munroe (without a song); but from her
humorous lover's point of view we can quite understand Mr. Percy
Fitzroy (Mr. T. W. Pioott) wishing to become the proprietor of the
Eyre Arms.
There is an important Bracelet episode, whioh of itself would have
furnished a basis for a Palais Royal farce, and the idea forcibly

"Down among the Coals " in a Miner key. The Villain axes for water,
and is answered by the Band of Hope.
strikes us that Mr. Pettitt originally constructed this play as a
comic piece, in three Acts, for the Criterion; that there was no
opening for it at that house, and that a happy thought ocourred to
him to make it into a melodrama, and get Mr. Charles Reads to
do the dialogue.
Bays Pettitt to Reade,
"We must succeed."
Bays Rbadb to Pettitt,
"Of course! I '11 bet it!"
Mr. Clynds is just the man for Hope,—only, why, when he is in
the coal-mine, should he occasionally infringe on Mr. Irvtno's
patent walk? Miss Amy Roselle, as the Heroine, the wise child
who knows her own father, has a rough time of it in a Pantomimic-
scene, a sort of "spill-and-pelt" to the usual exciting rum-tum-

A CURIOUS BEQUEST.
We shall be somewhat sorry when that strange compound of good sense and
absurdity, of modern ideas with ancient pageantry, that combination of a
preserved Epping Forest with the counting of horse-shoes and cutting of
faggots in Her Majesty's Court of Exchequer, of a splendid Free Library with
Lord Mayor's Show, of its famous City School with the scarlet Aldermen pre-
tending to assist the Judges at the Old Bailey Trials, when, in short, that
strange old Institution, commonly called the City Corporation, Bhall be
absorbed into the rest of the dull, heavy, colourless Metropolis.
It seems a fitting Institution for carrying out almost any freak of fancy; and
the latest Trust that they have just agreed to accept, though but a small matter,
will probably puzzle them more than others of far greater importance.
It seems then that our old friend Don Pasquale, called, in this case, Don
Pas-qu.u.k Fa vale, a Foreign Gentleman lately deceased, wishing to show his
gratitude to the City of London for having supplied him with a good wife with
whom he lived a life of happiness and prosperity, has bequeathed to the Corpo-
ration the sum of 18,000 francs in trust, to provide with the interest thereof,
annually, in perpetuity, three marriage portions, of 300 francs each, for three
Girls, natives of the City of London, between the ages of sixteen and twenty-
five, Buch Girls to be selected by lot.
By one of those humorous arrangements that would never probably occur to
any other public body but the Corporation, it has been referred to a Committee,
called the Law and City Courts' Committee, to provide for the carrying out of
this curious Trust.
What the peculiar duties of such a Committee may be, must of course
remain a secret to the uninitiated; but what possible connection can there be
between having charge of such solemn and dull institutions as Law Courts, and
the certainly amusing, and probably somewhat puzzling, details of allotting
marriage-portions to young Ladies? „.....« i a. ■ * •
We trust that the affectionate solicitude of the City Fathers for their fair
charges will not end with the payment of the dowry, but that some means will
be discovered of exercising a kind of parental care over them for some con-
siderable period after that interesting event. And as banners Beem U> play a
very important part in Corporation Processions, it might form a most interesting
feature of future Lord Mayors' Shows to have milk-white banners decorated

MR. GREENHORN'S EXPERIENCES.
"I AM Monarch of all I Surrey "—to a
certain extent.
Thinking, from what I hod learned of
"Compensation Cases," and Valuations, and
District Surveyors' Fees, that a Surveyor's
must be rather a profitable business, 1 ob-
tained an introduction, through my bankers,
to one of the principal West-End firms, and
asked them to take my Nephew into their
office. This they readily agreed to do, out
of respeot to my connections, as they said,
and en the following most advantageous
terms, as they said:—
1st. My Nephew was to be bound to them
far five years.
2nd. I was to hoard, lodge, wash, clothe,
and pocket-money my said Nephew for the
said period of five years.
3rd. He was to receive a salary of nothing
a year—payable quarterly, I playfully sug-
gested!
4th. I was to pay the firm a premium of
three hundred guineas.
I may have done very wrong, mistrusting,
as 1 do, my own judgment; but, after a great
deal of calm consideration, and after care-
fully balancing the advantages to myself and
my Nephew (which didn't take me long)
with the advantages to my good friends the
firm of Surveyors (which took me some time),
I actually decided to decline their most
generous offer.
Of course it is only my ignorance that
firevents me seeing the reasonableness and
iberality of the proposal made to me; but
to pay a firm of tradesmen three hundred
guineas to allow my Nephew, a fine, well-
educated, intelligent fellow of sixteen, to give
them five years' good service for nothing,
may be a very good arrangement for some
people, but, as it strikes me, not for
Joseph Greenhorn.
This week, at Cambridge, the Undergra-
duates are going to perform the Ajax of

LES POETES S'AMUSENT.
The Banquet of the!two distinct demigods is over. The dinner, a
two-franc Palais Royal feast tit for Parnassus, came off last night;
and I was there ready to watch and to wink at the matchless mouth-
f uls of the two mighty Masters. As these disappeared amidst rich
rhythm and rhapsody, I stood in a corner, note-book in hand, mutely
worshipful.
But let me proceed. The Elder Master was there first to receive
his guest. He had on a clean shirt, and looked like some Old World
giant hewn out of solid pasteboard. But he had not long to wait.
An altercation with the cocher beneath, in the grave and glorious
argot of Mediaeval Pioardy, soon trumpeted the fact that the Younger
Master had quitted his course hurriedly, and was mounting the
stairs, with the spring of a trousered Atalanta, five at a time. Then

Swinburne chez Hugo; or, The Good Pupil and the Mighty Master.
he entered. There was for a moment a sickly look, as of second class
and the salt sea, about him, but after fiercely cuddling the Titanic
Singer's head several minutes in a whirlpool of welcome, he crowned
him with heaving handfuls of peerless parsley, took his paramount
place at the table, and the colossal ovy^ayfio-ta commenced.
But at this point his potently unsurpassable and irrepressible host
arose. There was a hungry hush, as of .baffled and beaten annoy-
ance, but the Elder Master had a message to deliver, and catching
the reporter's eye, he did not halt or hesitate.
"What," he asked, addressing the lady presiding at the bureau
behind the little plated saucers of sugar, "what is Swiuburne?
Is he," he proceeded, "acostermonger? No. What then? A sweep?
You cannot be a sweep without singing a Song before Sunrise. But
this Swihbubne has written Chastelard. That sounds like Bacon.
Is he then a philosopher? Yes, and No. Which f Never mind.
But there is this remarkable thing about a philosopher: he produces
fruits. Sometimes they are nnts to crack, and when Civilisation has
a nut to crack it holds its jaw. This is a paradox, and suggests the
question, 'Am I Civilisation?' To this there is an answer. It is
again ' No and Yes.' Last time it was ' Yes and No.' Now it is
'No and Yes.' Why? Is there a reason for this? None. And
when there is no reason for anything, it becomes a subject of refer-
ence. To whom P To the Marines: and you cannot refer a subjeot
to the Marines without asking them a riddle. And this is the riddle
that posterity will ask them: What is Yictob Hugo P"
There was a pause; but in an instant the Younger Master had
sprung on to a velvet fauteuil, and, thrumming the back of an entrte
dish as an impromptu lyre, with a high-piped treble crv of "I '11
tell you," had soon sufficiently and signally silenced the Elder with,
the following unsung and understudied Ode :—
"Ton are he who,—ere upon my noisome nurse's
Large limbed lap
I coughed my first shrieked shrill-throated choke of curses,
In pulp of pap,—
Rose in reck made rich of decomposing matter
Round kinglets curled,
To greet with white-soul'd yell of' Yah!—who's your hatter ? *
An outwashed world:
"Ton who, with a wind of words in thuds of thunder,
Of sense made hash;
Blind, yet bleating in the blaze of your own blunder
W"hole yards of trash;

No. II.—Babt. Bumptious, in
Mono ay Night, November 20.—A buzz of surprised delight went
round the House just on stroke of midnight when Alderman Fowleb
entered, with a small but compact flower-bed attached to his coat.
Many surmises as to how the Alderman had been spending the
evening. Some said he'd been presiding at Horticultural Show
and had button-holed the prize, others would have it he 'd been to
a wedding and brought away his bouquet; whilst the third theory
broached was that, favoured by darkness of November night, he 'd
climbed the railings of Temple Garden and roamed among the
Chrysanthemums.
Obviously all these conjectures baseless. Alderman has many
gifts, but not the sort of person likely to climb over railings. Besides,
the flower-garden in his coat not composed of Chrysanthemums.
As to wedding, it's true we are getting on pretty well through the
day, but as yet don't get married after four o'clock. Alderman
could not have been breakfasting from then till now. As to Flower
Show, that takes place earlier in day. More probably he's been
meditating among the f ragrancies of Covent Garden, and picked up
armful of flowers tumbled out of a hamper.
However it be, here 'b the Alderman, or rather, here's the flower-
garden. So extensive is it that one hardly at first notices the
Alderman in connection with it.
"Thought it was Hampton Court coming to Westminster, like
Birnam Wood went to Dunsinane," says Hahcoukt.
Alderman unconscious of excitement created, smiles over the vast
expanse of flower-garden, and winks his left eye at Spkakeu. Quite
unintentional this, and Alderman hastens to withdraw the wink.
The fact is, a fern-leaf, some half-a-foot high, from time to time
tickles his right eyelid. Hence the phenomenon noted.
Wherever he's been. Alderman must have enjoyed himself much
better than we left behind, still pegging away at Procedure Rules.
Only sign of vigour in House is displayed at five o'clock, when
Members go rushing about in search of a pair for the night.
Butinet* done.—Reached Ninth Resolution.

satisfied. Appears that at the time, earlier in the Session, when
Irish Members were being exported from the House wholesale and
retail, like firkins of native butter, one of the clerks at table met
Nolan in the Lobby, and asked him if he would like to be sus-
pended. On consideration, the Colonel thought he would not.
Had been consulting Raikkb on question of how far he might go
in Party Obstruction without running penal risk. Raikks, it
appears, in intervals of leisure snatched from the business of the
Verwhole Rook Asphalte Co. or the Newport Abercarn Black-Vein
Steam-Coal Co., gives private advice on matters relating to
Obstruction. Just like gentlemen retired into private life from
Scotland Yard, you know, ready to advise on difficult cases. Nolan,
safe in counsel of ex-Chairman of Committees, declines to be
suspended. His wishes strictly observed, and whilst Joseph Gillis
and other eminent Irishmen expelled, Colonel Nolan was left free.
Now mentions Clerk's invitation as a grievance; whereas it was only
a polite attention.
Might come to bo the regular thing in time. Members walking
across the Lobby to post letters, meet Mr. Millman, who in blandest
manner, inquires "Would you like to be suspended to-day P" Just
as he might inquire whether you would like a ride in the park, or a
pair for the dinner-hour. Nolan's hot indignation spoiled all this.
"Another of the amenities of Parliamentary life gone," as Major
O'Gobman remarked when Speaker ruled that the word disreputable,
as applied to conduot of Her Majesty's Government, not Parlia-
mentary.
Lord Randolph's tender heart touched by Nolan's grief. BUM,
and in fiercest manner demands that Lyon Playfaik's head shall be
brought to him on a charger. In the heat of denunciation, rather
mixes up the furniture of the House.
"It is a monstrous thing," he says, fiercely curling his moustache
in the faoe of the Trembling Pbemieb, "that Messages like this
should oome to Hon. Members from the Chair."
Colonel Nolan rises to explain. It was the Table, not the Chsjr.
Lord Randolph almost speechless with added wrath at this
interruption. At a time when Constitution reeling under fresh blow

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
from Chairman of Committees, for an Hon. Member to split hairs on
a matter of this kind, is more than can be borne.
"Chair or Table," he shouts, glaring: upon Colonel Nolan, "it's
the same thing."
Nolan a fighting man: never loth for a tussle. This point at
least arguable. Might put it to Randolph: "If a chair is a table,
is a table a chair P' Half rises with this intention, but catching
sight of Randolph in the quite unusual grandeur of his passion,
thinks better of it, and resumes his seat.
Having disposed of opposition in this quarter, Randolph left free
to smite the Prehier, whom he accuses of guiltily keeping Lyon
Playfair "hovering in the Lobby" instead of answering these
tremendous charges. All glad when Randolph sits down, and no one
is hurt.
Rather expected he would sit on the Table, to show that there is
no difference between it and the Chair; but sank back in usual seat.
Business don«.—The Ninth Rule under consideration.
_ Wednesday.—Lyon Playfair came out very [well to-day from
his fresh difficulty. Seems Randolph's indignation of yester-
day was wasted, no understanding between the Arch-conspirator
and Chairman of Committees to hide dark deeds. L. P. never heard
of Colonel Nolan's fearful story till he read it in the papers. So
there 's an end of that.
_ But should it ever have had a beginning? Isn't there a disposi-
tion in some parts of House unfairly to pursue Chairman of Com-
mittees. Let s Playfair with Lyon, which I muoh doubt that
we've done these two Sessions past. If he has failings in the Chair,
they arise from excessive good-nature and overmastering anxiety
to do what is right. But aren't failings over-rated, and is due
allowance made for peculiar circumstances of time? No Chairman
has had to cope with difficulties equal to those of last two Sessions.
Playfair coming new to Chair had to wrestle with them and, more-
over, had to do it with consciousness of lack of sympathy on part
of large section of the House. That is hardest of all. Increases
by tenfold difficulties of position. Let Playfair have Fair Play,
and then jndge him.
[This is synopsis of speech addressed to Members in smoke-room
just now ; _ received with much applause. Gregory says, Glad-
stone nothing to me when I 'm roused. But Gregory such a wag.]
Business done.—Tenth Resolution passed.
Thursday Night.—Muoh pleased to hear of deputation waiting to
see me in Conference-Room. Seems that heart of mighty Metropolis
stirred by First Resolution. Conservative Working-Man arising in
his might to denounoe it. Seems to be getting up a little late; but
perhaps doesn't begin his week's work till Friday. Used formerly to

Remember thinking at the time Magistrate might as well have

That of course a mistake; these are horny-handed sons of toil.
Much impressed with unanimity and effusiveness of their views.
No gagging in House of Commons, they cry as one man. They will
rise in their might first. No tyranny of one Minister. No manacling

views to Gladstone. Shake hands all round, and make for door.
Surprised to find one Gentleman there before me. Got his back
against it, in faot.
"No, you don't," says be, wagging his head.
"Fork out! '• says another Gentleman in the crowd.
""We ain't goin' to be done twice," remarks a third.
"My friends," I say, "what is the meaning of this outrage on a
Member of Parliament P"
"It means you 're to fork out a bob each afore we leave this room,"
said the Gentleman at the door. "We 've let it stand over before,
and been done.

horny-handed sons of toil naturally bring in a little mother earth
with them. Didn't know deputations were such expensive things.
One or two a Session will be enough for me, I think.
Business done.—Irish debate on Motion for Adjournment.
Friday Night.—Find I mixed up the Phippses last week. Said
that Pickering got on pretty well in his speech, "but Charles
rather stuck." It was, as Mr. Anstey would say, vice versa. The
Member for Westbury quite a Parliamentary orator. It was
the other Phipps who, Pickering his way through a few massive
remarks, occasionally fell into a hole, and was dragged out amid
awful silence.
Rather a noisy than a lively night. Young cubs of Conservative
Party get the Lion into a corner and howl at him. If he could keep
his temper, could snap the whole lot up at a mouthful. Unfortu-
nately loses command of himself, and all else gone. A sorry spectacle
for both sides of House.

PRACTICAL VENICE.
(By a Commercial Childe Harold.)
I stood in Venice on the Bridge of Sighs;
A factory, a mill on either hand:
I saw from out the wave tall chimneys rise.
And wharves and busy steam-cranes edge the strand,
And palaces to warehouses expand.
A murky air, where sunshine never smiles,
As black as Bradford. This was once the land
Where poets sang its countless marble piles,
And RusriN wrote and revelled in ite sunny isles!
In Venice Ruskin's echoes are no more,
And steam has stopped the songless gondolier;
Her palaces are crammed with goods galore,
And barcarolles no longer meet the ear:
Those days are past—but Enterprise is here.
Shares fall, Stocks fade, but Commerce doth not die,
But reckons dodges more than Doges dear,
And gain above artistio sanctity;

GAMBETTA'S SHOT AND PLOT.

All was ready. The faithful Reinach had been with
him all the previous evening, and having no longer tick
(I'ceil) at Brebant's since he went out of office, con-
sented to Btay to dinner even before he was asked.
Weiss was there later, and the three Proclamations, to
Paris, to France, and to Europe had been finally
approved, and sent to the secret printing office of the
Republique Francaise, which, as everybody knows, is
situated next door to the coal-cellar of the Ville
d'Avray Villa. General Campenon had been going
to and from Paris all the afternoon, and finally brought
back the act of agreement by which he was to as-
sume the Presidency of the Republic for a fortnight,
when the PlebiBcitum would assuredly nominate Leon.
The army was to rise the next morning, and by noon
Gbevy and Brinon were to be playing billiards together
at Mazas. But it was noticed by observant conspirators
during the evening that at dominoes he did not get rid
of the double-six with his usual masterly prompti-
tude: and that when he proclaimed, "As partout!"
his toniturant voice faltered. Only when they brought
the contributions from Belleville (seven francs, five
centimes, and a packet of caporal) was he observed to
smile and murmur, "My brave Bellevillois, I knew
they would believe that I "ra doing it out of a disin-
terested love of Socialism: they always do."
But the next morning, when we were girding on our
arms for the fray, and they were bringing round Cam-
peson's war-horse to the back-door, our noble Leon was
seen to aim his ninth revolver at his little finger, press
the trigger, and fall back, exclaiming, "I am wounded!
Saute! I shan't be able to try a coup d'etat for a
fortnight now."
This is the authentic history. All others are guaranteed
spurious; as, for instance, the graphio account of his
duel in the Tuileries Gardens (shut for the purpose) with
Gbevt's son-in law, Wilson; his rash attempt on the
life of Rochefort, when his pistol providentially ex-
ploded in his hand; the vengeful attack of Madame
Edmond Adam, with whom he is en dilicatesse, which
was cleverly contrived so as to disable the very hand
which would have signed a decree consigning her to
New Caledonia—all these are fables of that Fontaine
which contains three-sous-a-liner's ink.
But perhaps the most ridiculous rumour of all is that
whioh asserts that the ex-Dictator had just simply such
an accident as will happen to plethorio civilians verging
on middle age. who will insist in playing with firearms.
The Paris of Victor Hugo is not going to betakjum

FRIENDLY HOVA-TUftES.
(Diary of Our Own Aboriginal Philanthropist.)
8 a.m.—See by the morning papers that the Madagascar Embassy
has been disgracefully treated in Paris, and has. in consequence,
arrived suddenly at one of the East-End hotels. Determine to set
off without a moment's delay, to convey my warm sympathy to
their Excellencies, and press on them any assistance that I can offer
them on behalf of the Society. Mem.—To take Blotter's British
Constitution with me as an introductory present, and find out the
whereabouts of Madagascar on my way. Fanoy it lies somewhere
off the coast of Java,—or in a sort of South Sea Archipelago some-
where. Ask the omnibus conductor. He has only heard of Rowlands'
Madagascar. Confusing. Get down in the Strand, and get up sub-
ject at a secondhand bookstall, watched by a detective.
10 a.m.—Thoroughly mastered it. It is 976 miles long, and pro-
duces rouge, straw hats, and india-rubber. Language, however,
difficult. Several alphabets, but only one vowel, which is never
used, except in a wail at a first-olass funeral. Wish I had learnt it
instead of French. Can't get a Malagasy dictionary at any metro-
politan station, but Oriental Crossing Sweeper at Bank says he can
speak the language as easily as Upper Tonquinese. Very lucky
this. Engage him at once as interpreter. Tells me if it's the
Embassy I want, he's quite sure they have put up at the " Cannibals'
Welcome," in the Mile End Road. Show him Bloker. Says if I
want to make the interview really cordial I ought to throw in some
rum. Buy a gallon, and put it into an india-rubber hot-water
bottle as a "oompliment. Think this is neat. Feel I shall have
something to report to the Sooiety.
Noon.—Fatigued. "Cannibals' Welcome," down a water-side
alley up a back street infested by cut-throats. Knock and ask if
Mr. Ravoninahitriniabivo is in. Landlady, in bonnet, says she
doesn't know, but if I mean the Patagonian Ex-Emperor on the
first-floor back, and haven't brought three pounds of tripe with me,
she wouldn't advise me to go in without a sledge hammer and a
oouple of policemen. Explain it's not the Patagonian but Mada-
gascar Embassy I want, and throw in the name of Mr. Raminabaka
as well. She says I must mean the parties in blue bed-curtains and
toasting-forks in the attic who say their prayers dancing, and pay
their rent in bamboo walking-sticks. But says she only knows
them as Banoo Jim and Onion Peelings. Interpreter says that's
right. Up. By mistake into the room of a copper-coloured Chief,
arrayed in bits of clay pipe, human funny-bones, and ostrich
feathers. Most fortunate. After a free war-dance with the inter-
preter he explains in dumb-show that his card-case has been
swallowed by a crocodile, but that he is Mr. Uavoninauitriniabivo.
I shake him warmly by the hand, and give him Bloker.
2 p.m.—Interesting conversation with him for two hours and a
half, through the interpreter. Won't however, discuss the nicer
details of the Frenoh aggression. Talk entirely about the fat of the
white bison. Try and draw him from this into a discussion on the
merits of the household franchise. He won't be drawn. Explain
the New Rules to him. Gets angry, and bars door. Interpreter
says if he doesn't soon have the rum, he '11 tomahawk both of us.

it is only on occasions like these that the leading thoroughfare of
London is properly scavengered. One day before the procession and
one day afterwards, the great bog which unites Wellington Street
with Waterloo Bridge was almost passable without stilts, and the
Vestry have reason to be proud of a loyalty which drove them into
temporary cleanliness.

TWADDLESTONIANA; OR, THE LAST OF THE BARON'S.
(Reported by Our Cwn Little Bitd on the Bench )
A cektain Lady of title having asked the Baron to describe this
case of Belty. Lawes to her, His Lordship at once replied, "This
is a Lawes suit." The Duoheas went into fits.
"Tbere is one bust which I shall not permit in Court," whispered
the Last of the Barons to Lady L . . . .
"And that is ?" inquired Her Ladyship.
"A Bust of merriment." returned the Baron, with a twinkle in
his left eye, while with his right he regarded the Usher with such
severity that that official nearly swooned on the spot. When Lady
L . . . . had sufficiently recovered her equanimity, her Ladyship
passed the jeu de mot on to her daughters, and they in their turn
to the Hon A. Y who nearly rolled off the Bench in convulsions
of laughter.
"I sbould like to ask the Witness," said the Baron, sotto voce, to
the Right Honourable C. B., "if his name is now changed to Vrr-
btden, because he appears to have been E-ver-hidin' formerly."
The Right Honourable C. B. almost swallowed his silk handkerohief,
and left the Court hurriedly.
"I wish I was being examined in Frenoh," said the Witness.
The Baron observed quietly that if some of the learned Counsel
were being examined in Frenoh they wouldn't obtain first-class
marks. This, added the Baron, reminded him of a French story,
which perhaps her Grace might recollect. . . . But at this point
luncheon was announoed, and the Court rose as one man.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SAVOYARDS.
We congratulate Messrs. Gilbebt and Spllivajt on the reception
given to Iolanthe by their first night's audience, but, above all.
do we congratulate them on having such an enterprising, astute, and
energetic Manager as Mr. D'Otly Cabte, who can hang Babnuh
himself as a Showman, and is up to every move on or off the thea-
trical boards.
Some idea of the ability with whioh the Oracle has heen worked in
this instance, may he gathered from the occasional paragraphs which
have appeared from time to time, during the past three months, in
various journals, calculated to excite the curiosity of the theatre-
going public concerning the forthcoming work by Messrs. G. and S.
First there was
the confiden-
tially commu-
nicative para-
graph, informing
the publio what
an excruciat-
ingly humorous
idea Mr. Gilbert
had hit upon for
the basis of his
new Fairy Opera;
then we were
told what this
idea was; after
a while the title
was mentioned,
but with caution;
then we read, or
it was somehow
"in the air,"
how the eminent
Librettist was
very angry with

pear out of the bag; and
paragraphs to explain that this part of the tail was
correct tip, and of course the admirabie Entrepreneur exclaimed,
with the immortal Manager Crummies, " I oan't think who puts these
things in. I didn't." Then a weekly journal treated us to a few
quotations of marvellous rhymes which were to be found in this opera;
how " for " was to rhyme
with the last syllable of
"Chancel/or;" how
"alive" was to rhyme
with the last syllable,
emphasized, of "Conser-
\ntive;" and, in fact, how
directly this libretto should
appear, the rhyming
powers of Colman, In-
goldsby, and Hood, would
be completely thrown
into the shade. Then we
read how one musical
critio had been so highly
favoured as to actually be
allowed to hear sixteen
bars of the Composer's
score, which had then and
there sent him into
such ecstasies of delight,
that he lay in a critical
condition (unprofession-
ally) for some hours, and
was only restored by one
of the Librettist's side-

and was subsequently allowed to be present at a rehearsal, or at a
portion of it, on the sole condition of incurring the terrible anathema
of Librettist, Composer, and Entrepreneur, should he dare to reveal
the secrets of the 8avoy. And yet, somehow or other, Crummlse was
to be startled again by more journalistic paragraphs. How delighted
must both Librettist and Composer be with the judicious zeal of
their devoted professional friends!


G. Grossmith as Chancellor, or Chant
Singer, who married a Fairy, and
is a Jessie Bond-holder.
Then the Publio were informed that, in order to proteot the copy-
right, and acting-right in America and England, this magnum oput
was ia be performed at some quiet out-of-the-way country Theatre,
of which mysterious representation due notice would be given tola
privileged few, just as in the days of the Prize King, the " where-
abouts and the when," with other
particulars, could be obtained by
the initiated and the Corinthians
at a few sporting publics on the
"night before the Battle.Mother."
Then the above report was con-
tradicted, and the piece was, we
were told, to be produced in New
York ana London on the same
night, the results to be cabled
there and back. After this
came the Manager's final
achievement of putting the right
people in the riglit places for the
first representation of Iolanthe &t
the Savoy, so that the Majority
for the Government should ex-
ercise the Cloture to good pur-
pose, and should be able to
silence any expression of dis-
satisfaction, and to employ the
gag for the yawn of weariness.
The result was a large gathering of Enthusiastic Gushers with whom
the Buccess of the new piece was, as one discriminating Critic wrote, ".a
foregone conclusion." It forcibly struck us that if such an audience
as jeered and guy'd the first representation of The Laureate's
Promite of May, at the Globe, had been assembled at the Savoy, the
First Act of Iolanthe might have been favourably, but not warmly,
received; while the Second Act, after the first quarter-of-an-hour,
would have met with rather a warmer reception than the Authors
had anticipated. When Mr. Tennyson brings out another comic
piece, let him engage the services of Mr. D'Oyly Cabte at least six
months in advance.
Iolanthe begins brightly enough, though the fairy music is from
the first disappointing. The humour is intended to consist in an incon-
gruous association of ideas, such as is the very essence of any Burlesque-
To select Miss Alice Babnbtt, who looks like a Giantess Marian
Junior, for the Queen of the Fairies, and to make her say that she
can " curl herself up in a butteroup," is funny,—but is only funny
as long as she is supposed to represent a real Fairy. But when she
speaks of herself as " clay," when we find that a Fairy suffers from a
"delicate chest," and when we see them, without any charm pro-
nounced to render them visible, chattering on equal terms with the
Burlesque Peers, the fun arising from the supposed incongruity
suddenly evaporates, and, having once laughed at the procession of
Peers, at Mr. Gbossmith as Lord Chancellor, smiled at Miss Jessie
Bond, who comes out of a pond in what ought to have been widow]s
weeds, and at Miss Alice Barnett as the Fairy Queen, thsre is
nothing else to laugh at, because the Author has himself destroyed
the incongruity of his own creation. Everyone can appreciate the

situation of a Titania, under a charm, falling in love with donkey-
headed Bottom, for he is still the mortal lout weaver, and she is a
genuine fairy. But the Iolanthe fairies are merely " ladies of the
ballet and chorus," and, hut for Mr. Sullivan's music (very far
from his best, and not up to his Patience and Pinafore), Iolanthe'$
Fairies, with a less select audience, would have only narrowly
escaped the fate of Foggarty's Fairy at the Criterion.
Mr. Gllbebt started with a funny idea, not perhaps quite pleasant
when too broadly insisted upon, but still funny up to or down to a
certain point,—we mean the notion of a son of a fairy mother and a
mortal father, who is fairy and immortal down to the waist, but
human and mortal from thence to the soles of his feet. His upper

part, or better half, can pass through a key-hole, but his
legs remain on the other side. This is an eccentric and
decidedly funny notion, of which, however, after once
starting it, Mr. Gilbebt has made no sort of use. The
idea seems to have been too much for him, and to have
become quite unmanageable: in faot, all allusion to it
might be entirely omitted with positive advantage to the
piece. So much for his very funniest conceit. The pro-
cession of Peers in their stars, garters, and coronets is
excellent fooling which will probably tell well in America.
Mr. Gkorge Gkossmith is capital as the Lord Chan-
cellor, and enlivens the scene whenever he appears. His
acting of the best song in the piece was inimitable; we
mean the " Said I to myself, said I"—not exactly a new
and original refrain, by the way, "Says I to myself,
says I" being among the oldest of old recollections:—
"Says I to myself as I walked by myself,
And myself says again to me;"
and in the Second Act the patter-song, descriptive of a
nightmare, seems to have been suggested by Planche's
well-known " I'm in stick aflutter I scarcely can utter."
In the Second Act Mr. Gbossmith's burlesque step-
dancing elicited as hearty an encore as was accorded to a
similar performance of his as The First Lord of the
Admiralty in Pinafore.
The words of the songs ."generally, as is invariably the
case with Mr. Gilbert, are always good, the rhymes
clever, but not absolute marvels of rhythmical ingenuity.
The dialogue is not worthy of the Author of "hardly
ever" and the very witty "not a too French French-
bean." The first-night audience roared with laughter
at the Lord Chancellor informing Strephon that the
latter must not tell him "what Nature has said, as it
was not evidence," just as if they had never heard of Sam
Welter being rebuked by Mr. Justice Starleigh, when the
former spiced his evidence with "as the soldier said,"
"You mustn't tell us That the soldier or any other man said,
Sir," interposed the Judge; "it's not eridence."
The Chorus of the Fairies and Peers in the Second
Act is about the best " number " in it, and is well sung
and acted; though as for the acting all round, both prin-
cipals and chorus seem to have been instructed to do
very much the same as they did in Patience, the atti-
tudinising and the peculiar sing-song tone of delivering
the dialogue, in fact the business of the stage generally,
evincing no such originality of design, or novelty of
arrangement, as to call for particular remark.
Asa musical or a humorous work Iolanthe is not within
a mile of Pinafore, nor a patch on Patience, nor has it
even anything to equal the When Constabulary Duty's
to be done," which enlivened the Second Act of the not
too lively Pirates of Penzance, and after the first burst
of curiosity has been exhausted, we do not fancy that the
Public will take to Iolanthe as they have to Messrs.
G. and S.'sprevious productions.
i propos of the Savoy, the Illustrated Sporting and
Dramatic News, the week before last, gave us an
amusing story, telling us how one of Mr. D'Oyly Cabte's
young and lovely ladies having received a note, contain-
ing an invitation to supper, from a fascinating idiot in a
private box, gave it to Mr. Giibebt to read—(Why?
Couldn't she read it herself ?),—who, so runs the
simple tale, "happened to be in the theatre," and he
immediately dispatched the Acting Manager to order
the effusive and very Ineomplete-Letter-Writer out of
the house. The Billy-Dooist very naturally refused to
act on this very high-handed notice to quit ■ but, on its
being represented to him that the services of Chuckers-
out would be put into requisition, and that Someone in
authority, nay, perhaps even the Eminent Librettist
Himself, would publioly denounce him from the pulpit—
we mean the stage—he considerately withdrew.
The audience would have been dead against the In-
oomplete-Billy-Dooist unless he himself had publicly
protested against the interpretation put on his eccentric
conduct, and had added that "The man who would lay
hands on a woman, save in the way of keyindness, is a
villain," when he would have taken the opportunity to
explain that his invitation was intended to be included
in the saving clause of the above accepted formula.
Capital subject for a Bab Ballad,—The Siren and the
Saveloy; or. All Song and No Supper. If the Billy-
Dooist would only repeat his impertinence, and then
imitate Lord Queensbebby by standing up in the Stalls
protesting, it might be a useful advertisement to Iolanthe.

Mud-Salad Market: to widen the street sometimes known as Turnip-top Hill,
but more generally as Southampton Street, Strand: to take down the whole
north side of King Street (better known as Waggon Row), the north side of the
Market, properly so called, comprising the huge building which has been to let
for several years, and has never been occupied, and that sleeping beauty known
as the False-Start Club; to take down the whole of the west side of Little James
Street, more generally known as Rotten-Cabbage Alley; to remove the churoh
of St. Paul's, Covent Garden (sometimes called St. Cauliflower-in-the-Mud) to
some place where it is more needed; to carry with it the surrounding houses in
King Street aforesaid, Henrietta Street (or Cabbage Grove), Bedford Street (or
Potato iPlace); to remove the south side of Great Russell Street, the west side
of Wellington Street, the north side of Tavistock Street, and the east side
of the Market, forming a square, now known as Flower-pot Square; to take
powers, if necessary, to make the'.Floral Hall what it never was—a Floral Hall,
or Market—and throw in, if neoessary, the whole block, bounded on one side by
the " Bedford Hotel," on the other side by the old Bow Street Police-Court,
and on the other side by the north side of Great Russell Street, the roadways
of which are known as the Great Mudford Bog; to remove the block of old
houses in the Market which are backed by Tavistock Street aforesaid, and
flanked by Southampton Street aforesaid and a oourt known as Pease-Pudding

Explanatory.—Surprise has been expressed at the prevalence of particular
political opinions in certain crafts and callings. It is now stated that the
Radicalism and anti-hereditary-legislaToryness of .Cobblers is a consequence ot
their fondness for " Closed Uppers," whilst it may be regarded as quite natural

FOR THK LAST SrVBN YeARP. LAST WEDNESDAY SOUS VISITORS ACIUALLY CAME!
A CHANGE OP ADDRESS.
Mr. Punch {saluting). A great day for you, Madam!
Themis. That depends somewhat upon the sense in which the
word "irreat" is taken, does it not?
Mr. Punch. Preoisely; you but anticipate me. Still, in a very
real and worthy sense, this is a great day—a memorable one at least.
Themis [thoughtfully). Memorable, yes. Six centuries hence
memory may revert to to-day, as to-day she goes back, point by
point, shadow by shadow, act by act, over the intervening centuries
to the hour when Justice was first installed in the Hall of Ruf us at
Westminster yonder.
Mr. Punch. The Mother of the Muses is doubtless mistress of the
panoramic style, so popular with readers of the Fenny Press.
Mnemosyne," as a leader-writer in the Diurnal Diffuser, might
remark
Themis. Enough! I take the hint. I have waited long enough
for my new abode.
Mr. Punch. "And in its season bring the Law," says the Laureate.
The Law's "season," like the British Spring, is often long delayed.
The season for bringing the Law hither, however, has arrived at last;
your flitting is accomplished, and—what do you think of your new
home?
Themis. It is doubtless sufficiently spacious and majestic When
the imposing pageantry of the hour is forgotten, the question as to
whether it u " a joy for ever" or—very muoh the reverse, will, 1
nippose, like most testhetio questions, settle itself. At present, that
which is to be the haunt of those whom popular prejudice associates
with leadership diabolio, scarcely seems to me to possess the splen-
dour of the Miltonic Pandemonium.
Mr. Punch. The site where the Bar was and the Griffin is, does
not seem fated to be the abiding place of "Things of Beauty." But
the 0riffin will never see what the Bar once beheld, when Barbarity
was the auxiliar of Justice, and Horror the handmaid of Law. The
Philistinism of hybrid pinnacles is better than the Molochism of
spiked heads.
Themis, Yes. The Leviathan Doctor would hardly know his
Fleet Street now; but, per contra, Swift would not need himself to
tongue-lash Mohocks into skulking flight, with a half-dozen of my
truncheoned minor-ministers within easy hail.
Mr. Punch. As they invariably are—of course, eh? Well, your
bewigged "birds of a feather" will be able to "flock together"
now, more conveniently and more comfortably. The question sug-
gests itself, what will Themis, well housed, be able anon to do, not
for her servitors, but for her suitors P
Themis. May it not now be said of Themis, as it has been said of
her who presided at this day's installation:—
'' Her Court is pure, her reign serene "?
Mr. Punch. Pass the purity—it is not impeaohed. As to the
serenity, ha! ha 1 The serene slowness of Law's paces and pro-
cesses sometimes savours of what irreverent schoolboys call " serene
cheek." No, no, of course you don't understand slang-^tfAw slang,
at least; but "the Law's delay " is a phrase not unfamiliar to you.
Lag-footed Law doth Time deTour,
And gobble up the State,
WhiUt every step demands an hour,
Each hour means six-and-eight!
Themis. Smartness is seldom judicial.
Mr. Punch. Is that a reason why Justice should seldom be
"smart" P No, Themis, slow Law means dear Justice, and dear
Justioe means Justice manque". "This is the shop for Justice," you
might say—if your sublimity could stoop to crude colloquialism.
Using, for once, if you. will allow me, the language of "Shop," I
congratulate you most heartily on the opening of your new establish-
ment, and hope its business may be conducted on the modern prin-
ciple of "easy terms," its maxim being the tradesman's one of
of " moderate charges and prompt delivery."

The Ajax at Cambridge last week was, all things considered, an
excellent performance. Mr. J. N. Stephen, as the hero, was stupid
and fierce, as an Ajax ought to be; Mr. Macklin, who played Tec-
metta, was good. We sent down a youth of our acquaintance, who
said he knew Greek, to look on and report to us, as we thought
it might be of benefit to his classical Btudies. He refused to have
recourse to a "crib," observing that "he would only take to a crib
again when he arrived at his second childhood." Apparently, how-
ever, his classical studies have been neglected, as he sends us
the following string of remarks and questions, which he says he
"jotted down" while the performance was going on. Well, when
we see the youth again, we intend to "jot down something but
no matter!—
Were the ancient Greeks a sect of the Baptists? That thing they
oall the "thymele" in the programme is evidently nothing but a
font.
Why should Tecmessa be got up to look like an advertisement of
Rowland's Kalydor?
Mr. Macklin, as Tecmessa, seems to have a good deal of difficulty
with his hair. Can't quite arrange it like pictures of Mrs.\LANQTBr,
but is evidently trying his best to do so.
If Ajax is going to fall on that wretched little blunt pocket-knife
of a sword, Tecmessa needn't make such a fuss about it. It couldn't
possibly hurt him, though he might damage the sword.
Why do we hear the sound of people coming down-stairs rather
heavily before the "Chorus of Salaminian Sailors " enter through
the bronze doors? Is there a loft above the stage where Sala-
minian Sailors can partake of ancient Greek refreshments? This
would be a real " Attic" loft.
That tall man in the Chorus can't be an Undergraduate. He
must be Old Pakb, or Methuselah, or the Vice-Chancellor, perhaps.
Chorus, "Tol-lol." Evidently carefully trained. "Now, a good
long shudder all together !" must have been a frequent bit of stage-
direction at rehearsals.
If Menelaus is really a king, and not an ancient Greek who's
going out to a masquerade-ball, and has lost his way, why doesn't he
knock Teucer down when the latter is " cheeking" him <
Is that Agamemnon, " King of men" P Well, somehow or other
I didn't expect him to look like that, exactly; but I suppose it 'a all
right.
"Ajax hides himself behind a gooseberry-bush." Stage-direction.
But is it a gooseberry bush, or a rook? and why do the Chorus,
when they come to look for him, (to mooning and singing about the
stage instead of seeing his heels sticking out from behind the bush,
or rock, as the audience can?
Greek plays are very dry. How did the spectators at ancient
Greek plays get on without a Refreshment-bar P Was there a
stage-door at the back of a Greek theatre? How about suppers
afterwards? Doesn't the well-known line "When Greek meets
Greek then comes the tuck in," refer to conviviality after the Play?
Who was Sophy Klees? the authoress of this play P

Glad the O'Goemaw's pleased, but it's a little hard on others,
especially those immediately near front Opposition Bench.
'A little loud, isn't he?" I Baid to Joseph Gillis, who, seeing-
everybody but Thomasson and the O'Gorman unhappy, was
thoroughly enjoying himself.
"Oh, (jlang with you!" cried Joseph, "Gibson's well enough.
He s spoiled by them Castle fellows; but he's an Irishman at heart.
Knows well enough our Parliament's at St. Stephen's Green, in
Dublin, and always pitches his voice so that Speaker over there may-
hear him."
Glad to see Joseph Gillis thus sportive, if only for a moment.
Has been evidently depressed of late. Some secret sorrow, I fear,
gnawing at his heart.

[December 9, 1882.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAHIVARI.
Another Motion for Adjournment to-night, which is pretty well for our New
Rules.
"Seems to me, Toby," John Bright said, as we were having a cigar in the
Smoking-Room, "this Second Resolution is playing the devil with the House—
I mean the devil who, being turned out, said he would go back to his house,
and finding it swept and garnished, took seven other spirits more wicked than
himself. The last state of this House, Toby, is worse than the first."
Business done.—Begun the night's work at half-past eleven. Cross's Motion
to negative First Resolution of Standing Committees rejected by 133 votes
against 77.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Quite affecting to see how inconsolable Tories are
in absence of W. E. G. The more pleasing, as one would never have suspeoted
it. It is, nowever, only their way. When they worry him, howl at him, and
in other ways vex his soul, it is only their way of showing their affection.
To-day this bubbled forth in irrepressible flood. William, having been in
constant attendance on Resolutions for five weeks, thought he might take
half-an-afternoon's holiday. Hadn't been gone an hour when Conservatives

The Grand Old Morgiana and the Forty Thieves.
began to grow uneasy. Parliamentary life had lost its principal charm. There
were Chamberlain and Haktinqton on the Treasury Bench, but no use baiting
them.
"Might as well try and stir up the Griffin with a long pole," Randolph
grumbled; "give me Gladstone. Half a touch, a look, a word sets him off,
and fun begins."
Discontent grew as afternoon advanced, and still no William. Randolph
tugged mercilessly at his moustache, Gokst groaned, Dbummond Wolff ran in
And out of the House more than ever like a hen distressed for its chickens.
During short moments he remained could not be induced to do more than sit
on extreme edge of bench. Off again in a moment, and back again and off
again. Wabton sunk in deep melancholy. Snuff delighted him not, nor
"Hear 1 hear!" either. Yobke began to regret his action of Friday. Perhaps
he 'd killed the goose that laid the golden egg on which personal insolence
throve. Stanley Leighton silent. Sir W. Babttelot anxious. The Alderman
dumb.
At length Hicks came to the rescue of the party.
"Let us," said this remarkable man," begin ah ovo. Let us move the Adjourn-
ment."
So they moved the Adjournment. Declared couldn't go on in the absence of
William, and so got through the afternoon without doing any work.
Thursday.—"Well," said Randolph, stopping me in the Corridor, and
glaring upon me as if I were Mr. Gladstone, "what do you think of this
precious Ministry.now?"
"What have they done ?" I asked, with a sinking at the heart. Been out
of the House twenty minutes and one never knows what may have taken place
in that time.
"Why here's the Irish Members imploring Gladstone to let them have a
Committee all to ;themselves, and he positively refuses! Never had such a
chance before. Not sure he '11 ever have Buch another. If I 'd ' been in his
place would have jumped at the offer. Put them all on the Committee, give
them a good strong room, start a subject of debate, and in two hours there
would be nothing of them left except O'Donnell's eye-glass and the smile
of Joseph Gillis."
And Randolph strode impatiently away. What a man it is! Full of
resource, quick to see, ready to act. A little weak on facts, as Gladstone
says; but none of us are perfect.
Business done.—Standing Committees ordered.
Friday.—Autumn Session collapsed to-night with same suddenness and much
the same general air of surprise as pervades Mr. Phillip Callan's hat when
he sits upon it. Randolph had been talking- cheerily about eating his
Christmas-pie in Members' dining-room. Certainly, said everyone, Session
will go into next week. Only question, up to what day. This being settled,
Autumn Session died suddenly at twenty minutes to nine, deeply regretted.
Its end was peace, which is more than can be said of its beginning or its
middle. Business done.—Everybody goes home.

Esquimaux have ever read Pickwick, and are acquainted
with anything about the Fat Boy. If " Every Boy " for
whom this work is compiled only knew about half of

A LICENSING DEAD-LOCK.
The unseemly squabble between the Lord Chamberlain, the Metropolitan Board
of Works, and Messrs. Sri Kits & Co. with regard to the merits and defects of the
Criterion Theatre, only draws attention to the glaring defects of our licensing system.
The Criterion is a curious compound building, standing in Piocadilly, which contains
under one and the same roof an eating-house or restaurant, a huge drinking-bar,
a ball-room or music-hall, and an underground theatre. The public-house department
is licensed by what is called a District Board of Magistrates, composed largely of
local tradesmen, with another licence from the Board of Excise for the sale of tobacco
The ball-room, or music-hall, whioh is situated near the clouds, is licensed by an irre-
sponsible body of gentlemen, numbering several hundreds, who sit for two days only
eaoh year in Clerkenwell, and are known in these pages as the Meddlevex Magistrates.
Against the decision of the local Magistrates there is an appeal to the Clerkenwell
Bench, but against the decision of the Clerkenwell Bench there is no appeal.
The Criterion Theatre, which is placed just as low as the music-hall is high—being
somewhere in the bowels of the earth—is licensed by the Lord Chamberlain, a Court
official, who is not allowed to act on his own judgment without a certificate from
the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Lord Chamberlain's Department have publicly
stated that they think the theatre one of the safest, if not the most safe, in London;
but the Metropolitan Board of Works, in spite of similar testimony given by one or
two of their leading officers, decline to authorise the Lord Chamberlain to grant a
licence. Here is enough of licensing and divided authority for one unfortunate building.
To make matters worse, the public-house is allowed to communicate with the ball-
room or music-hall, which is rarely used, but not with the theatre, which is used nightly,
although such communication would not make the
theatre more of a public house, or house for the
public, than it is at present, and would materially
add to its safety as a public building. This latter
restriction is in Lord Nevebdabe's Act of 1873—a
standing disgrace to so-called Liberal legislation.
The Seldom -at- Home Secretary is said to be think-
ing over all these points in bis new Municipal
Government Bill: but long before this mighty
measure is passed, a twopence-halfpenny portion
of reform might surely be given to the poor patient
stupid public 1

COME INTO "THE GARDEN," MATJD!
A very Ideal Idyl of the (we hope not very remote)
Future.
Come into " the Garden," Maud!
For the Mndford blight is flown;
Come into "the Garden," Maud!
I am here by the " Hummums " all
No garbage stenches are wafted ~v
And the slime from the pave:
For a breeze of morning blows,
Yet my hand is not compelled
To hold up my handkerchief close to my nose,
As it had to be always held.
When the shops in the market of old would
unclose,
And the cry of the porters swelled.
All night have the suburbs heard
The wheels of the waggons grind;
All night has the driver, with seldom a word,
His horses nodded behind;
And your waggoner is as early a bird
As in Babylon one may flna.
1 say to myself, "No, there is not one
To block up the street and stay
Till the hum of the City hath well begun."
I chortle in joyaunce gay.
"Now half to the Southern suburbs are gone,
And half to the North. Hooray!
Low on the wood and loud on the stone
The last wheel eohoes away."
I say, this m better now, goodness knows,
Than it was but a short time syne.
Oho 1 my Lord Duke, I am glad to suppose
That much of the credit is thine,
That I need not go softly and hold my nose,
Or feel sick like a man on the brine.
No scent of rank refuse goes into my blood
As I stand in the central hall;
And long in "the Garden" I've strolled and
stood,
Without feeling qualmish at all.
And I say, This is really exceeding good,
An improvement that's far from small."
The paths, roads, and gutters are almost sweet,
And the stodge, like foetid size,
That used to impede one, and foul one's feet,
No longer offends one's eyes.
'Tis a pleasantish place for two lovers to meet;—
Quite an urban paradise.
So, sweetest, most sensitive-nostril'd of girls,
Come hither!—the stenches are gone.
Foul dust blows no more in malodorous whirls,
No cabbage-leaves rot in the sun,
Damp-reek from choked gutter won't straighten
your curls,
So come—'twill be really good fun!

was there any place handy where one could
get a square cut off the joint, with taters,
and suet-dumplings to follow? But no,
we must dine with them; and the mys-
terious talk that Repasseur had on the way
was like a bit out of the old Vic. drama.
He wanted to know how many bayonets I
had turned out for the good cause, and
whether my brother Job knew the latest
things in poison for the rats of the Royal
Family.
It was worse when the speeches came.
A. big fellow, who wanted shaving badly,
got up at the top of the table with a red
flag. We'd rather have had the Trades'
Union-Jack, but we said nothing until he
began to say that Society ought to resolve
itself into its original elements, when,
"No," says I. "the original elements are
all very well, but they didn't use no knives,
and I 'm a grinder, I am." Then they
wanted to know if we were game for Anar-
chy; and a lot of us, thinking it was a new
kind of drink to take with our after-dinner
pipe, Baid "Yes." But you should have
seen the disappointment when they simply
handed round bombs in table-napkins, and
asked us to pledge the Universal Nihilism in
a draft of sugar-and water.
"I Bays slope," says my right-hand
mate; and slope we did. And, after
visiting the newspaper Ni Dieu, Ni Maitre,
Ni Rien (jolly simple title, Lhyd't), and
assisting at a Socialistic Conference, where
the orators made spittoons of each other's
faces, we thought we had just better go
and see the Folies Bergere alone; and like-
wise have a look in at the Elvsee Mont-
martre. It's nicer than the other Elysee,
though Grevv was civil as you please.
But, would you believe that, when they
heaid we had shaken hands with him,
those Ni Dieu, Ni Nothing Else fellows
brought out a special number, saying we
were all deteotives in disguise.

I AM one of the "prosperous artisans" who are suppos-d by the satirical Tory preBs to

over to Paris four or five times iu the year; and, in point of fact, the Bulleyvards were
rather less familiar to me than liosherville when we crossed last week without our missuses.
The masters cross without theirs, who are frequently cross with them; so why not we?

Bermondsey, unless it was Southend in the Season.
They are an uneasy kind of people those Bulleyvarders. They had delegates to meet us;
and the Knife-grinder who was especially appointed to look after me—they call him a Repas-

OPENING OF THE NEW LAW COURTS.
[A Personal Reminiscence of December 4th.)
When Mr. Bertie Mitford courteously
informed the Authorities at the Punch Office
that the Chief Commissioner of Works would
not consider the show perfect unless Mr. P.
was officially represented, and when this was
communicated to me, I at once exclaimed,
"My wig I" and subsequently added, "and
gown!" for it was clearly stated that "full
forensio costume" was as indispensable as
whatever is indispensable necessarily must be.
Now, where was my "full forensio costume P"
The last time it had made its appearance with
myself inside it was at an Old Bailey Trial,
when the lady, for whom I was eloquently
§ leading "coercion" as being under the in-
uence of her accomplished husband standing
beside her in the dock, was so unaffectedly
annoyed with my successful attempt at sepa-
rating her from her guilty companion that she
then and there took off her laced-boot and
hurled it violently at my wig, taking, however, so poor an aim that it
cannoned off Mr. Beslet, caught Mr. Poland (for the proseoution),
and, but for its expended force, would have gone off at a tangent
in the direction of the Clerk of the Court's nose, which it never
reached, but fell on the desk in front of him.
After this brief but brilliant episode, I regret to say that, in the
most guileless and good-natured way, I lent my "full forensio
costume" to my then partner in Chambers, who has since become a
Q,.C. and a County-Court Judge, but who, at that time, represented
himself as unable to Btart on Circuit unless I lent him my wig, gown,
and bands, which I did, and have never set eyes on him or them
again from that day to this. I believe, in faot, that such was his
success in that "full forensio costume" of mine that he stayed on
Circuit, became its leader, was made a Q.C.. and is now a distin-
guished County-Court Judge in the North, where he will remain till
he returns South to enjoy a pension of two thousand a year paid
Quarterly, and will never give a thought, unless I remind him, which
shall take the earliest opportunity of doing, of the "full forensio
costume " to which I attribute, and he ought to attribute, all his
success.
When I come to think that I ought to have been in that wig and
gown, that I, and not he, ought to have gone North, that I, and
not he, in that wig, gown, and bands, which were my property,
not his, ought to have gone on that Circuit till I led it, and that in
all probability he never would have gone that Circuit at all if he had
had to pay ready money for a wig and gown instead of "cheeking
me out of it"—lam sorry, at this distance of time, to use the ex-
pression of a man now so eminent in his profession,—and telling me
that I could not possibly want it, and that I had better stay at home
and vary the proceedings at the Middlesex Sessions with occasional
attempts at light literature;—I say when I come to think of all this
and consider what prizes I must have chucked away with that" full
forensio costume," I confess that my feelings towards my eminent
friend are not untinged with bitterness.
But as a member of the Bar of England I was determined to
behave as such on the 4th of December, when England expected that
every barrister should do his duty in "full forensio costume."
Thtjmp, Q..C, couldn't lend me any of his. They were all out for
the day. Some of my barrister friends had only got one set, and
others had lent their second-best for this occasion. Happy
Thought.—The theatrical wig-maker, Mr. Clarxson, in Bow Street.
No sooner thought of than done. "Wig? Certainly, Sir," said the
obliging Perruquier. "What sort? Working trick wig, a scratch,
Brutus, brown George, or Second Charles ?" he asked as he showed
me into his back-shop among all the Pantomimic big heads, false
noses with spectacles, beards, moustachios, and wigs of all descrip-
tions for general Christmas purposes.
Much as I should have liked to have appeared in the New Law
Courts as Judge Jeffreys—when I should have been admitted with
the greatest deference by the Police, and shown out again with
rather less ceremony—I confined myself to the "full forensic
costume" of the Victorian—or Wigtorian— era; and though, in
spite of the Perruquier's earnest assurances, I still had my mis-
givings as to whether the costume hadn't been made for theatrical
purposes, and whether there wasn't something about it which
wouldn't stand the test of daylight, having been meant exclusively
and originally for effect behind the footlights, I was, after the first
quarter of an hour of the trial of my forensio costume or " Law
Suit," perfectly satisfied with the result, until the Guards' Band,
very soon after my entry into the Hall, struck up the music from
"The Trial by Jury," when it occurred to me that Mr. Arthur
Sullivan was directing the music, and had recognised my "full
forensio costume " as having been worn by the leading counsel in
that Operetta. As, however, on this solemn and historic occasion,
the staple of the musical selections seemed to come from this amusing
composition, of which the great feature, the song, " I'll tell you hew
I came to be a Judge," was performed on the appearance of either
the Lord Chancellor or the Lord Chief Justice, I felt that the
dignity of the legal profession was being trifled with, and was glad
when the air changed to " The Lost Chord," though what this
had to do with the opening of the Law Courts it would be difficult
to say. Still, the effect was soothing.
Gradually, but with difficulty, recognising many familiar faces
in strange costumes,'it occurred to me that there must have been a
geat run on the stores of Messrs. Claukson's, Mat's, and Nathan's.
ere was Sir Julius Benedict as an Admiral; there Mr. J. L.
Toole as himself (without a song); in the next compartment was
Mr. Edward Lawson in a splendid military uniform, got up
probably as one of his own dashing Leaders; then there was Mr.
Matthew Arnold, in black velvet and lace, with a sword. Such a
variety of cocked hats I have not seen for a long time: some that
could be worn with difficulty, some that could only be worn with
Buoh an effort of strength as would render it improbable they could
ever be taken off again, and others that could by no possibility be
worn or have been ever intended for wearing.
Higher up I recognise Mr. Edmund Atlas, in the evening dress of
a gentleman who is prepared to dine at any hour of the day; and
further on is Miss Ellen Terry, who ought to have come as Portia,
with Mr. Irvikg, not as Shy lock, though if they had brought with
them a few of the Lyceum Company, they might have ascended the
dais, and filled up one of the dull quarters of an hour with an
intellectual treat from The Merchant of Venice, which, no doubt,
they would have done, but for the awe-inspiring presence of Sir
Theodore and Lady Martin.
Then H.R.H.'s Attorney - General, Mr. Charles Hall, Q..C,
walks up the hall in a great hurry, as if he had just come in to fetch
something, and wanted to get away as quickly as possible.
The music has dried up. An awkward pause. Somebody, in grey
trousers and morning dress, walks down the hall and out of the door,
and it is generally supposed that he has been turned out on account
of the colour of his nether garments. Stage-Manager Mitford very
busy. Pause. Excitement. Judges march down " a terrible show.
They oome down very stately, but finding that the official call-boy
has summoned them long before they 're wanted, they break up into
groups and tell funny stories to one another, varying the proceedings
by shaking hands with Mr. Gladstone and Sir W. V. Harcourt,
with all the impressement of men who are forgiving old grudges and
making it up all round generally. Mr. Toole wishes to catch the
Speaker's eye and relieve the "wait" with a little melody. Mr.
Gladstone, however, advises him not, and says he 'd better leave it
till he comes to breakfast with him. Judges in procession, march
out,—having resumed their dignity, each looking as " grave as a
Judge " is proverbially supposed to be. Return of Procession, with
Stage-Manager Mitford bearing a Pantomime-key, as if they were
going to play Blue Beard.
Then, at last, Her Graoious Majesty, not in robes of state, which
disappointed those who wanted to see their Queen as The Queen with
Imperial Diadem and Sceptre. Presently we hear her voice from
one end of the hall to the other, sweet, clear, and distinct; then a
sermon by Lord Selborne; and finally Her Majesty communicates,
as a great State Secret, to Sir W. V. Harcourt that the Hall is open
(if it hadn't been, how could we all have got in ?), and the Home
Secretary, who evidently cannot keep a Lady's secret, stands up,
and before anyone can stop him,
cloture him, and take him to Tower
Hill, calls out, in stentorian tones,
that the Hall is open; which breach
of confidence apparently so annoys
Her Gracious Majesty, that, after
all the Judges have passed before
her, and eaoh given her a bob,—it
wasn't more than this,—Her Gra-
cious Majesty arose, and, leaving
the brilliant assembly to get out as
it best could, took advantage of the
Hall being open at both ends to make
her exit by a door at the back.
It was all over, bar shouting; and
as Her Majesty drove off there was
plenty of that, and then more for the
Prince, who, as Chief Bencher (or
whatever the title is) of the Middle
Temple, went across the road to lunch with, that august and most
hospitable body.
Talk of Inns I Show me any Inns for food and comfort like the
Inns of Court! "Take mine ease in mine Inn"—rather! The
luncheon was—like all the arrangements in the Middle Temple—
admirably done, though the last thing we saw was an eminent Judge

Here and there a figure may be a little wooden, though this is only
characteristic; of Dealt, but taken as a whole, all the Little Sixes
and Sevens will be dealy-ighted with the work.
From De la Rue & Co.'s come Rhymes and Reasons To suit the

certain to go down with the Public. From the same Publishers we
have also a new edition of the Grimm old tale of Rumvelstiltskin,
illustrated by Geo. R. Halkbtt. This is thoroughly Christmassy,

have been more genial and Christmassy, though these are, according
to the verdict of Our Mistress of Arts and Local Examiner, "Most
Lovely!" The same learned Theban Lady has highly eulogised the
satin cards of De la Rue, their book-markers, and their diaries,
which latter our M.A. pronounces " Really charming!"

to agree with the wants of " the "Times I"
Well, if that ain't flat rebellyon I don't know what is.
I should have thort from what I sees and hears, that if there was
one Institooshun in the hole civilised world that allers keeps its
mashinery jolly well greased, it's the grand old Copperashun. And
yet the werry hed and front of it says as how it wants haltering and
must be made to fit the wants of " The Times."
Who cares for "The Times" now? I prefers the "Evening
Noose," for I sees in that new horgan of Conserwatism, lots of things
as I don't see no wheres else. Brown says as they ain't true, but,
how does Brown know. Brown ain't everybody, tho' he is a
Hed Waiter. But what do I care? What I reads there emuses
or staggers me, acordin to suckemstances, jest as muoh as if they
was as true as steal. "We all gos to the Play, don't we? but the
Play ain't true, and yet we all iikes it quite as much as if it was,
p'raps more, and we larfs and we crys if we 're in the Gallery, as I

know as it was all a sham, in fact I feels sure as I shoud at once
call for the pelisse, as of course I ought to.
I wunce had a great respec for age, and it seemed to grow stronger
as I growed older, but if the Grand 01(1 Man is a-going to reform
the Grand Old Copperashun insted of s^mperthising with it as one
would natterally egspeo, all I can say is, give me Youth and Content-
ment before Old Age and Reform.
Let us rewew our forces, my noble Paytrons.
The sacred House of Lords is with us to a man, aye and to a Bishop
too, as we all knows. The Markis of Satjlsbury tells us as all the
young men are Conserwatives, so they 're all for us. Mr. John Mills
onoe told us as all the old women was Conserwatives, so they 're all
right, and of course all the old lovers of the good old times as is left
is right.
Then what does his Lordship fear?
How our ennemys will rejoice, not that I thinks much of them
or their ways either. Just phansy, they 've bin a egsiting their-
selves and a trying in wain to egsite others for about two long ears,
and yet they 've never wunce had a single dinner! Muoh they must
know about Human Natur.
The sillybrated Scotch Gentleman Mr. Firth op Froth, oommonly
called the Sage of Chelsea, will clap his glad wings and crow when he
reads the Lord Mare's confessions, and the Tresurer of the League
will Bhake his emty purse with joy, and in Mb dreams see it ower-
flowing the werry brim.
And now, as if to heap staggerer on staggerer, the learned and
gallant Alderman Hanson, of all Aldermen of the City, returns his
lead when the Lord Mare leads such a bad sute, instead of leading
off trumps at once, as all us Waiters nat'rally egspected.
I shoud respectably recomend him to reconsider his sentyments.
He can't have much else to do. He's only a Alderman and a Knight
and a Master of Hearts and a Lef tennant and a Feller of the Serciety
of Antequeerys and a Shipright and a Merchant Taylor and a
Kernel and a School Boarder, that's all, so he must have plenty of
time to spare. But it's the old story I suppose, Sumbody finds
sum mischief still for idle hands to do, so the sooner he gits some-
think more to do, the better. I should wenture to sudgest as a
little relaxation, the Bored of Gardiens or the Small Pox Asylums
Bored.
And now, in conclushunj if I might wenture to give jest one word
of adwice to the four million an a quarter of us Londoners, I would
say respecfoolly, in the words of the emortal Poet, "better put up
with all the good things as we have, than fly to a lot of bad things
as we knows nothink about."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAKL
HISTORY RE-VIEWED.
By Whytc Washchcr.
No. III.—Louis ihe Eleventh, the Type of Unselfishness.
:m general impression, relative to the character of this great and good King,
has been for many centuries dreadfully unfavourable. He has been accused of
meanness, deceit, heartlessness, frand, and even murder. He is frequently
supposed to have caused the death of his father, and to have poisoned many of
his nearest relatives. It is needless to state to those well conversant with the
real facta of the case, that these rumours and reports are of a distinctly libellous
character—quite needless. But those who have not made the reign of the
Eleventh Louis their study, those, in fact, who know nothing whatever about it,
may be safely informed that these scandalous biographical incidents are largely
adulterated with exaggeration. The subject of this sketch may have had his
faults (who has not f), but they were all on the surface, and were the outcome
of a great, a thorough, a sublime unselfishness.
At sixteen, he organised a scheme for soothing the declining years of his
father, which, had it been successful, would have put him to great personal
inconvenience. The idea was to induce Chablks the Seventh to resign the
throne, and so arrange matters that he should pass the remainder of his days in
a fortress, a monastery, or some other retreat equally retired and peaceful.
And yet, had Charles (through the instrumentality of his son) been dethroned
or murdered, Louis would have had to reign in his stead—this at an age when

i/V
Mutual Confidence.
the restrictions and formalities of Court-etiquette would have been more than
usually irksome. But the good son did not allow these considerations to influ-
ence him in the least, and was quite ready to assist at his father's enfranchise-
ment. The scheme failed, and Charles insisted upon treating the Dauphin's
companions as traitors. Rather than vex his father by opposition, Louis
accepted this view of the case, and received the news of their fate with resigna-
tion and even cheerfulness. A few years later, the good young man was accused
by a oertain Count Dammabtin of having attempted to bribe him to murder a
person who was known to be obnoxious to the former. Fortunately for Louis's
good name, there was conclusive proof that the Count, in thu matter, had been
ffuilty of deliberate falsehood. The proof rested upon the firmest ground—the
Prince's own word. Louis settled the matter once and for ever, by promptly
denouncing Dammartin as a "naughty storyteller." Strange to say, Charles
refused to believe his own son, and the Dauphin was banished from Paris for
four months. Louis did not return, but went to the Court of the Duke of
Burgundy, who received him with the greatest kindness. While there, he
amused the people by sowing dissensions between his host and his eldest son.
This was an aot of pure unselfishness, as, had his tactics been discovered, he
would undoubtedly nave got into disfavour with both parties.
But it must not be imagined that he had forgotten his absent parent. Always
mindful of his father's comforts, Louis contrived to provide Charles with a
number of little delioaoies, of which he deprived himself, through the hands of
his domestics. For some time the King refused to eat them, but breaking his
rule one day, he died rather suddenly. So did Agnes Sorrel, a lady of the
King's Court, who was also present at the banquet. And yet Louis did not
hesitate to furnish his father and his father's friends with food that, had he
kept it for his own table, would have been sure to have produced a profound
sensation. And this is the man who has been painted as a monster of selfishness'
The moment Louis became king, he dispossessed his yoanger brother of every-
thing that had been given to him by their father, not for his own aggrandise-
ment, but because he wished to save the Duke of Bebbi from temptations
inseparable from rank and property. Moreover, to teach the Duke of Bubgundy
this wholesome adage, "that you should treat your enemy as if some day he
will become your friend, and your friend as if he will some day become your
enemy," he spent the greater part of his long reign in
making hollow peace and real war with the man who had
shown him kindness in his youth, when sympathy was
more than usually valuable. And yet this disinterested
oonduct has been condemned by the thoughtless as
treacherous and ungrateful! It was neither. It was
the ambition of Louis to make the Duke of Bubgundy
one of the greatest masters of strategy of his age. Under
his tuition he became so. On one occasion the King was
unwise enough to place himself in the power of the Duke
at a time when he (the King) was bribing the servants of
the Duke to betray their master. Louis was anxious to
see what the Duke would do. His pardonable ouriosity
was speedily gratified. The Duke made his guest his
prisoner, and only granted him his liberty on condition
of his assigning certain provinces to his brother, the
Duke of Bebbi. The King waa profuse in his liberality.
He not only made over the provinoes, but gave his
brother a very fine peach. After the Duke of Berbi had
eaten the peach, he died; and Louis, overwhelmed with
grief, kept the provinoes aa a memento of his poor
brother's sudden decease.
From these little anecdotes it may he gathered that he
was a good son and a kind brother—he was also an
affectionate father. He never allowed his son to go to
school, not because (as has been cruelly suggested by the
malicious) he wanted to keep him too ignorant to be
troublesome, but because he knew the Dauphin, boy-
like, preferred play to work, and did not wish to run
counter to his inclinations. And it speaks volumes for
the really affectionate nature of Louis that hi* son con-
trived to outlive him.
Finding them shunned by most of his other subjects,
he made his barber and hangman his constant com-
panions. He was never so happy aa when he had them
in to tea. It was a pretty sight to see the good-natured
monarch entertaining these strange, weird guests, and
attempting by witty and amusing conversation to dispel
their gloom. And it says a great deal for the prejudices
of the age that these two persons never accepted an
invitation to the palace without providing themselves
with enormous bottles of antidotes. These merry
meetings used to take place in the royal library, which
was filled with volumes of the King's favourite authors,
amongst whom were included practical jokers of all
descriptions, from the author of The Witticism* of Joe
Milter up to the inventor of the Thumb-screw and the
Scavenger's Daughter.
In many other matters this monarch showed his un-
selfishness. Fond of fighting, he yet bought off Edwabd
the Fourth and his army, when they spoke about the
hostile invasion of France, by arranging to marry the
English King's eldest daughter. He subsequently denied
himself the extreme pleasure of wedding a bride he had
never seen by leading to the hymeneal altar some one else.
Again, politeness to ladies was his favourite hobby,
and yet, when he had a confidential letter from the
youthful Duchess of Burgundy, he did not hesitate for
a moment to hand it over to her subjects, although well
aware that she would consider the proceeding a Bign of
the greatest discourtesy, as it would put her to grave
personal inconvenience.
But perhaps the best proof of his extreme thought-
fulness fur others, and utter abnegation of self, was
afforded by his great exertions to keep alive. Although
extremely ill, he warded off death by every means in his
power to the very last moment, for the simple reason
that he was unwilling to give unnecessary trouble—to
the undertakers. And with this triumphant example of
his disinterestedness, this short memoir of his life is
brought to an appropriate conclusion.
Overheard at the "Globe."
He only said, "The Play is dreary,
When all is done and said."
He said, " I am awesry, aweary,
I would I were in bed I"
Mrs. Ramsbotham's Uncle has had another severe
attack, but she tells us she has sent him La Phytiologie
clu G<>ut, by a French Physioian, Dr. Brilliant Savar,*,
a well-known authority on the complaint, bo she hopes
it will do him a great deal of good.

DRAMATIC DOINGS.
No Theatricals this week to speak of—that is, for us to speak of.
"We 're going to do without em, We don't want any more "—till
next time, but just note en paisant that at the Opera Comique
Messrs. Savile Clarke and Slaughter, with their An Adamless
Eden,—have scored a success. Mr. Slaughter scored the music.
The collaborateurs have " invested" the Clay figures—the Lila Clay
figures—" with artistic merit."
At the Princess's, Messrs. Herman and Jones's Silver King is
earning golden opinions. Mr. Wilson Barrett is "getting a big
boy now. So is his brother George. More on this subject—anon.
M. Sardou has brought out a new Play, called Fedora, with the
diaphanous Sara Damala as heroine. One of the chief situations of
the piece appears to have been suggested by the Author's own
Patrie, while the character of Countess Olga the Russian spy reminds
us of a similar part in Dora, and bears a still stronger resemblance
to the heroine in La Main Coupee. Mr. Bancroft, who was the
happy possessor of Dora, has purchased Fedora, and should there
be any difficulty as to casting the divine Sara's part, he will, of
course, play it himself. Well, he will really play it very nicely.
At " Hare and Kendal's" Establishment a serious Play has been
produced, with a title peculiarly suggestive of the style of piece
associated with the Criterion. It is calltd Impulse. Any playgoer
can, without much difficulty, imagine Mr. Chaklbs Wyndham acting
on impulse. The Drama at the St. James's is founded on La Maison
du Mart—an announcement whioh seems to have puzzled the Critics,
who were wild at having to acknowledge their ignorance of the
original.
The Westminster Play Phormio was a sucoess. It was written
gome time ago by an Irish Author known as Terence, and was trans-
lated into Latin from the original. Its full title as given by the
Westminster Scholars was, of course. Sixth-Phormio, It was
whispered at the last moment that the Loud Chamberlatn would
have reiuBtd to license it if he had had a " crib" at hand, but it is
probable that he received one too late to withdraw his consent. It
is significant, however, that the Phormio has been withdrawn and
will not be repeated.
Our friend Mrs. Ramsbotham says she shall go to the Strand
Theatre when they produce Shakspeare's Play, called The Two
Romeos. Mrs. R. knows all about the plot, and says that " there
are two Theohphmes in it, and of course Mr. Irving will play one
of the Romeos and Mr. Clarke the other, and both be mistaken."
She doesn't think there can be two Juliets after having once seen
Miss Ellen Terry.
Of course there is nothing from the French at the German Reeds'.
But of the entertainment given by the St. George's Hall Co. (Limited),
we shall have a good deal to say—when—when we've seen it. As the
melodramatic ruffian growls aside, as he scowls at the stalls, "A

The Serio.
SOMETHING LIKE A COMIC SONQ.
Sib,—It has been the constant complaint that we as a nation have
no music This is nonsense. Ton have only to look at the list of
the ballad publishers, to find that the supply certainly equals the
demand. I have no doubt the cry to whioh I have alluded is raised
by the less successful of
our song-writers who, hav-
ing produced a mournful
ditty, and failed to please
the Public, have conse-
quently lost heart, and
retired, so to speak, into
their musical shell. These
v i *^.SA S^T^^S I, composers were, to say the

of the Music-Hails, the
most pathetic composition
has a second chance given
it if it proves a frost on

hissed as bathos, it may be
applauded to the echo as
rollicking waggery.
To show you what I mean,
I will "do" a pathetic
ballad into "serio-comic" myself, and then you will be able to see
what advantage Apollo may have by possessing a second (string to
his bow.
With your kind permission' I will take "Remembered," an old
ballad of Virginia Garbrikl's, with words by Kpssell Grat. Here
is the first verse, whioh I give you in its purity before transpos-
ing it :—
"Have you forgotten it P I never can.
One blessed night in June.
How bright the sky, how pale your face
In the wan light of the moon.
"Do you remember it, for oh! I do,
The acent of the Sowers there r
Was it the birds upon the trees,
Or the red rose in your hair P"
There it is. Sir. And now to " serio-comicise " it. But this I
must do in a dramatic form:—
Scene— A Music-Hall Stage. Enter Miss Tollt-de-Rol dressed as
a burlesque Prince. Enormous applause. She winks at the

CRAM AND CRASH.
Something about it, from an Indian Civil Servant's Diary. Vide
recent correspondence.
1870.— Settled to go in for it. Splendid pay, fine opening—then
the competency for life to finish up with, Feel I must put my
bhoulder to the wheel. Here goes?
1873.—Hurrah 1 Floored it. Thirteenth on the list. By Jove!
that fellow Bines is a first-rate crammer, and no mistake. I
managed my French, Italian, German, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Law,
Literature, Philosophy, History, Political Economy, Geology, and
Lower Mathematics, fairly enough by myself, by giving them six-
teen hours a day for two years and a half; but I never should have
squared Dynamics, Hydrostatics, Optics, Bengali, Arabic, Sanscrit,
Persian Metaphysics, and the Political History of Mediaeval Eastern
Asia, if I hadn't sat up as well all night with Binkh! However,
it 'a over now, and I 'm down for Bombay— and.I 'm as fit as a lark.
Wonder, by the way, what's the matter with my right eye, that
when I look steadily at anything for half a minute I seem to see an
illuminated arm-chair revolving backwards on its own axis.
Curious.
1879.—Jumped out of window again this morning. Feel if this
goes on much longer I shall have to give up Gibblepore, and go home
on sick leave. Can't make it out. I seem to have a carving-knife
and fork through my head sideways, and yet no control over my legs
on horseback; and I am continually fancying I see empty furniture-
vans floating across the ceiling topsy-turvy. This is what makes
me unconsciously jump out of window when in low spirits. Heard
too. this morning, that Smith, Jones, Brown, Robinson, Williams,
and Jenkins, have all had to be locked up in different Lunatic
Asylums. Poor fellows! So odd too, for they all did tuch capital
papers in Differential Trigonometry. Much better than me. Hulloa I
here comes the furniture-van! Can't stand it. Houp-ld! Out we
go again!
1882.—Been bad—so they tell me. Of course the voyage home upset
me. How could it help doing so? And how could 1 help, the very
first thing when I arrived, " going for" the Civil Service Examiners
with a leaded hop-pole, and trying to get Bines's head off with a
hand-saw? Natural enough—eh? I fancy I managed that job
neatly, too. Ha! ha!—Hulloa! Here's my keeper! Ready lor
him? Rather. Where's the poker? I'll teach him Bengali.
Wooohoooh! Give him a life-competency? Ha! ha 1 ha I Half-a-

N.B.—Mr. Punch, in publishing the above, appends a note ex-
pressive of his hope that such journalistic extraots are rare, and
that the melancholy reports of over-strain that have lately reached
him are somewhat exaggerated. At the same time he feels bound to
add that he fears they are not altogether devoid of truth, and that
the culpably insensate cramming that has of late obtained only too
widely in certain quarters has been productive, if not of absolute
catastrophe, at least of muoh suffering and disappointment. Mr.
Punch will keep his eye on this matter.

REPORTS OF OUR OWN CITY COMMISSIONER.
No. II.—Litekt Companies.
Mh. Punch, Sir,
Hating in my first Report described the origin and present oondition
of these curious but, in Borne respects, most interesting Institutions, I shall
now proceed to refer to some of the rather startling eTidence I elioited about
two years ago, and conclude by suggesting such reforms as the progress of the
age (as it is somewhat ironically called) demands.
The first strange fact that I learnt was that the Members of the Tarious
Guilds have, as a rule, no connection whateTer with the seTeral Trades the
Guilds are named after and were originally established to goTern.
For instance, the Master of the Worshipful Company of Grocers may be
really an Ironmonger, and deal in Sootch Pigs; while the Master of the Iron-
mongers' Company may be a Grocer, giving nis scientific mind to dates and
currants. This is, of course, all wrong, and must be changed accordingly.
But as no good reform should be sudden, I should reoommend that a new
Commission should be immediately issued, with good handsome salaries—who
should be the Chairman of such suggested Commission, it is not for me, even
remotely, to suggest—to ascertain the actual trade or calling of every Master,
"Warden, or Member of the Court of Assistants of eaoh of the twelve principal
Companies, and then so to arrange them, by means of exchange, as to remedy,
in some degree, this gross anomaly. Supposing, for example, a real live Fish-
monger should be on the Court of the Worshipful Company of Skinners, and a
real live Skinner should be on the Court of the Worshipful Company of Fish-
mongers, they would have to exchange Companies, so that the real Fishmonger
would cease to be a sham Skinner, and the real Skinner would join the Skinners'
Companv with all the experience in skinning that he had learnt from his
brother Fishmongers.
Again, supposing a real Salter (whether Dry or Wet) was on the Court of the
Vintners' Company, and a real licensed Vintner on the Court of the Salters'
Company, they also should exchange Companies, so that the real Salter should
oease to be a sham Vintner, but join the Salters with all the useful experience
he had gained among the Vintners, and the sham Salter would become a real
Vintner, with a keen recollection of his old motto, " Sal
Sapit Omnia," which he might find of considerable use
to him and his brother Vintners in the mysteries of their
private calling.
The second point in the evidence to which I would
call your special attention is the system of Apprentice-
ship. The Master of the Bellows-Menders' Company
stated, with a degree of frankness very much to his
credit, that the whole thing was a mere sham; that
he himself had, as an apprentice, the son of a wealthy
Baronet; that, of course, the son of a wealthy Baronet
did not want to learn the mysteries of bellows-mending;
and that if he did, he, the Master, could not teach
him, as he happened to be a Dry-Salter.
This bad system I should at once reform by changing
the sham Apprenticeships into real Travelling Scholar-
ships for learning abroad all that can be learnt of the art
ana mystery of the various Trades the Guilds represent.
To show how earnest I am in this important matter, I
beg to state that, happening to have three strapping
Bons, with magnifioent appetites, between the hungry
ages of sixteen and twenty-two, I am willing to so far
sacrifice my paternal instincts as to allow them to be
among the very first to test the practicability of my
magnificent scheme. I have submitted the matter to
them, and, with true patriotic ardour, they state that for
a mere paltry allowance.of, say, £300 a-year each, they
are willing to start immediately.
The next point for consideration arises from the very
remarkable evidence of the intelligent Beadle whom I
had under examination in January of last year. He
stated that whereas formerly the Members of his Court
when they received their frequent fees of five guineas
each, were accustomed to retain the five pounds, and to
Eut the five shillings in thePoor-Box, that of late (to use
is own emphatio language) "they wraps their half-
crowns in their five-pound notes, and quietly pockets
the lot." I cannot but look upon this as a step in the
wrong direction, utterly unworthy of such distinguished
philanthropists, and 1 recommend its instant abolition
and a return to the good old custom of condoning the
offence by the saorifice of 5 per cent, for ready money.
Another point, suggested to me by a remark of the
candid Master whom I examined, is the almost infinitei-i-
mally small power possessed by the Livery. I consider
these powerful Courts of Companies as about the only
specimens of pure Oligarchies remaining in this free
country. It may be considered desirable to retain this
objeotionable form of government in these particular
instances, as showing us what to avoid; but, howeTer
that may be, it shows with what an Ironmonger's
grasp the Livery are held in bondage, when a Master
can exclaim, " Who cares for the Livery? They don't
dare say a word. They know that if they did, we should
never put them on the Court!"
The obTious cure for this state of things is to let the
LiTery elect the Court.
This is said to haTe been suggested lately at the
Hall of the haughty Drapers; but a threat by the
Court, if it were persevered in, to at once disallow the
beautiful Boxes of Sweetmeats, oalled " Services," pre-
sented to the Livery at their grand banquets, effectually
stifled the rebellious idea.
Here, for the present, I pause; but will finish the sub-
ject in my next Report.

THE COUNTRY CLIENT IN TOWN.
Why are the new " Royal Courts of Justice " described as "open,"
when all the Judges are still either at Westminster or Guildhall P
Does this steep, narrow, and gloomy-looking flight of steps lead
to the Chancery Offices, or to the dungeons for convicted criminals?
My Solicitor told me to meet him in " the Hall," when we could
have a quiet chat about my great case, which is coming on, against
"the Amateur Stockjobber, or Sharc-and-Share-alike Company,
Limited." But where is the Hall?
Ah, Policeman! Here we are again. This is the fifth time that
I've come back to you after a long and fatiguing ramble up stone-
steps, down stone-steps, round corners, through corridors, end under
arches, in an utterly futile attempt to discover the Great Hall.
If the Policeman did not seem to be on the point of taking me up
because of my movements being suspicious, I should ask him if this
sort of thing is what the Lawyers call "going oircuit."
The Gentleman who has just fallen rather violently down the flight
of steps leading to the Strand, owing to a collision with me round a
Earticularly dark corner, may perhaps sue me if I remain to inquire
ow he feels.
I notice that the style of arohiteoture is desoribed as " Modern
Gothic" Then 1 suppose that streaking a building all over with
alternate zig-zags of red and white brick, so as to give it the appear-
ance of a faded, quilt counterpane, was really the Gothic idea of
ornamentation.
This deathly silence on all sides is beginning to be quite alarming.
Is it possible that, as the Porter and Policemen both seem to think,
my Solicitor may, after all, have intended me to meet him at West-
minster, and not in the Strand 'i
"My Cousin," said Mrs. Ramsbothah, "was anxious to be Mayor
of Snogglethorpe; but his opponents said his candidature had no
raisin date whatever ; whioh observation, seeing he was the principal
grocer in the place, I thought extremely rude.

To dine alone at your Club,
and to say that you prefer it a

To growl at the weather, be

To eat heartily of roast beef,
turkey, mince-pies, and plum-

To find that your balance at
your banker's is considerably
more than you anticipated,
and yet .to say that the ac-
counts you provided for
months ago and whioh are now
sent in for the first time will
be your ruin.
To enjoy yourself thoroughly
at the performance of a pan-

ADVICE TO AN ACTOR.
Do not call your part a rule;
it is not English. Never speak
of a programme, when you
can say bill, and do not call
the wings the coulisses. Do
not style yourself an artist,
or an artiste, as the case may
be, and do not speak of ap-
plause, however loud and
genuine, as a perfect furore.
Do not describe a perform-
ance given at three o'clock in
the afternoon as a matinee,
and do not call a burlesque a
travestie, or extravaganza.
When a Conoert or mixed
entertainment is given be-
tween more solid pieces at a
benefit, there is no occasion
to describe it as a melange, or
inter-mezzo.
When you speak of the
under-floor of a Stage, you
are not compelled to call it the
mezzanine, and you cannot
feel astonished if an ignorant
carpenter corrects you by
suggesting the mongrel term
mazarine. The word Theatre,
which ought to be spelt
Thidtre, has obtained a foot-
ing by long usage; but Play-
house is much more agreeable
to worshippers of the British
Drama.
"Another Fire! Well,

The Idealist. Holly and mistletoe. The old ivy-grown church
embedded in the snow. Rosy-cheeked children welcoming their
silver-haired grandsires to the family-board. Yule log, ancient
customs, and general goodwill.
The Representative of Matter-of-Fact. Fog and rain. Rates and
taxes left with a peremptory message. The dovs home from school
with a fresh repertoire of practical jokes. Bills, Christmas-boxes,
and extortion everywhere.
The Maiden of Sweet Seventeen. Dreams, sighs, and Christmas
cards.
The Widow of Forty. Dresses, simpers, and wishes for Leap
Year.
The Pantomime- Writer. Produced on Boxing-Night, after having
been ordered in January, sketched in April, written in June,
mounted in August, and rehearsed from Ootober.
The Pantomime-Player. Here we are again I The same old
wheezes, the same old pokers, the same old business, and best of all
—the same old salary!
The Card Worker. Well, it brings in a very useful custom, which
keeps us employed nearly all the year round. Most fortunate now
that valentines are out of fashion.
The Card Deliverer. Ridiculous idea! Means nothing but a lot
of extra work to us. And a postman had quite enough to do
before!
The Schoolmaster. Oh, certainly! Glorious institution 1 Relaxa-
tion most necessary for the young. Quite a question whether an
extra week of Christmas vacation might not do both Mentor and
Telemachus a great deal of good! Surely, the marriage of the Duke
of Albany merits recognition!
The Pupil's Parent. Certainly not! Absurd custom! Discipline
imperative for the young. And if Dr. Birch once more finds an
excuse for lengthening the Christmas holidays by a single hour,
young Master Tommy snail go to another school at Easter I
The Tradesman. Christmas here again! Must get out the circu-
lars about "My little account."
The Householder. Christmas again! Half a mind to go to Paris
without leaving an address!
The Public Generally. Christmas! No, no! Everything that is
disagreeable! All bosh to pretend we like it. We don't!
And Mr. Punch in particular. Christmas! Yes, yes! All that
is pleasant! Quite sensible to like it. You know you do! Come,
come, my good friend, even if you can't deceive other people, at
least you may humbug—yourself. So here's a Merry Christmas to
all of us!
Money Market [City Office, i o'clock, Tuesday).—there is no
change in the Bank to-day. Dealings in the Stock Exchange have
been very moderate. The fire in Madrid caused Spanish Stocks to
fall about three-farthings, and the rumour that M. de Brazza had
obtained a further advance of twenty pounds from the French Gov-
ernment, for operations on th« Congo, caused the French Rentes to
fall about three-halfpenoe. Turkish A, B, C, D, E and F were
much depressed, but G, H, I, K and L were very lively. No cause
can be assigned for either movement. American railways were firm,
except in a few places where they had been undermined by floods,

A HANDBOOK OF KNOWLEDGE.
No. IX.—Railways. Pabt III.—Int and Outt.
Q. When the traveller has been directed to the platform from
which his train is to start, are his difficulties at an end?
A. By no means. He is quite likely to have been misdirected.
Q. What then happens?
A. One or other of several unpleasant things. He'may perhaps
be carried to some distant bourne quite other than his desired haven.
If it should not go quite so far as that, however, discomfiture awaits
him iu other forms. Probably, just as he has seated himself, and
adjusted his belongings, a whiskered face will be thrust in at the
window, and a peremptory voice will demand, "Where for?" In
the innocence of his heart the passenger will cheerily and confidently
give the name of the Station he wishes to alight at. Then a look of
coarse scorn will mantle the countenance of the myrmidon, and the
passenger will be hurried and hustled again on to the platform, to a
running commentary of sardonic and disparaging remarks on the
part of the whiskered one.
Q. But why does that official not confine himself to civilly inform-
ing the passenger that he has got into the wrong train P
A. Simplicity combined with civility would afford no scope for
the indulgence of the ruling passions of the railway mind.
Q. What are these?
A. Bumptiousness and bad temper.
Q. Pray proceed.
A. Another form of the great transfer joke is the sudden and
clamorous summons to all the passengers in a particular train to
shift, at the last moment, into another. The guards and porters in
this oase rage up and down the platform howling "All out! All
out!" in stentorian tones, and when the startled passengers have
fairly grasped the meaning of this unexpected charivari, they have
to grab together their impedimenta, make headlong exit from their
carriages, and scuttle wildly about in searoh of others. Those who
happen to be deaf, drowsy, or preoccupied, stand an excellent chance
of grasping the situation just a little too late.
Q. Supposing the passenger has really hit upon the right train?
A. It behoves him then to take great care that he doesn't get into
the wrong part of it. To this end he will have to peer up at small
boards painted in minute characters, erratically distributed, and
oonveying partial and imperfect information. In their absence or
absolute unintelligibleness, he will have to fall back on the painful
alternative of "asking questions," a pernicious practice which
railway officials hold can only be kept within reasonable bounds by
rudeness and wrong answers.
Q. But is it not the very business of railway officials to furnish the
public with all needful information?
A. Undoubtedly. But, then, it is not always their pleasure.
Q. Having discovered the right carriage, what is the passenger's
next difficulty?
A. Entering it; often a task of much labour and some risk.
Q. How so?
A. In various ways. The handles of railway-carriage doors are
very often so arranged that it is impossible for any but powerful
male fingers to move them. The doors themselves are dreadfully
fiven to sticking fast. This is awkward when you are outside,
ecause you are compelled to summon assistance. It is more awk-
ward when you are inside, because the train may possibly move on
before that assistance comes. Then the ascent and descent of the
carriage-steps are compassed about with many perils. To step from
the platform over a foot of yawning space up two feet on to a sharp
door-scraper-like footboard, to scramble—or fall—down three feet of
darkly uncertain descent on to a gravel slope, where platform there
is none—these are involuntary gymnastic exercises provided for
elderly gentlemen and nervous ladies by the paternal despotism of
the Railway Autocrats.
Q. Could not the necessity for these athletio feats be avoided?
A. Easily; by the adoption of suoh common-sense arrangements
as continuous footboards of sufficient width, and platforms of
uniform height and adequate length. But with the introduction of
these would disappear many of the existing facilities for comic
contusions, funny fractures, humorous sprawls of persons, side-
splitting scatterings of properties, amusing maimings, and droll
deaths. Not all, however, tor the way that trains, supposed to
be stationary, have of making sudden and, as it would seem, pur-
poseless plunges, forwards and backwards, at the most unforeseen
moments, would still provide the Public with unsought opportunities
for awkward tiounderings and dangerous falls.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE AND CHRISTMAS CARD-BASKET.
Harding's Christmas and New Year's Cards, on white satin, ivory
and silver are exquisite. Fancy white satin, ivory and silver for
cards!! The floral designs by Miss Hewitt call for speoial remark-
Miss Hbwitt
knows how to do it.
Which rhyme had it occurred in a Savoy Fairy Opera would be con-
sidered by some critics a* something quite too-too-overpoweringly
brilliant.
The firm of Messrs. Cassbix, Petter, & Galpin is like the In-
exhaustible Bottle. They 're still at it, the latest at our Booking
Office being The Little People's Album, whioh oontains pretty little
stories for pretty little people able to read 'em, and a new edition of the
immortal Bo-Peep. There are three memorable beaux—Beau Nash,
Beau Brummel, and Bo-Peep—which last might have been, had
the notion occurred to anyone at the time, the sobriquet of the
celebrated Paul Pet. But the fame of Little Bo-Pekp, who was
born long before the other beaux, has survived that of the others and,
like the Giantess Marian, is " still growing."
Blackie & Sons, publishers, &o., in no way oonnected with the
ebony musicians who " never perform out of 8t. James's Hall," as the
name might suggest—have brought out Facing Death (a lively and
seasonable title), whioh is a " tale of the coal-miners," appropriately
brought to light by Blackib & Sons. It is well illustrated, and is a
real good story really well told. So is Tender Drake's Flag. The
sequel to this might be Under Duck's Wing or the Lost /Stuffing.
Another capital story, also from The Blackie'b house—one Blackie
more—is In the King's Name by Manvillb Fenn. First rate for
boys. From Mr. Pusch's own publishers, Messrs. Bradbury &
Agnew, comes Nature at Home, illustrated by Karl Bodmer, who,
to judge from his admirable work, must have lived for years in a
state of Nature. Of this book we can only exclaim with the onoe
oelebrated Herr Von Joel, when he used to go into ecstasies about
the glee-singing at Evans's, "Pootiful 1 Pootiful!"
CABINET PIECING.
Scene—Downing Street. Mr. Gl-dst-ne standing at fireplace,
vainly endeavouring to pull the edge of his shirt-collar half an
inch nearer the roots of his hair.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Heigho! Life would he endurable only for
its patronage. Somebody's always dying or resigning, and I have
to put some one in his place. Perhaps I make one friend; certainly
I make a hundred personal enemies. Worst thing of all is to make
a Dean. There isn't a man in Orders who doesn't think he would
make the best possible Dean. Bishops are bad, hut an Archbishop
is moderately easy. I don't believe there are more than five hun-
dred reverend gentlemen who think they have insuperable claims to
be Archbishop of Canterbury.
{Enter Lord D-rby.)
Good morning, my Lord. Glad you 've come. I wanted to talk to
you about entering the Cabinet. Now we 've lost Joan we must
have Darby, you know.
Lord D-rby. Whit do you mean by Joan?
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Why, Joahn Bright, of course. But, perhaps,
yon are not accustomed to jokes.
Lord D-rby. No; I can't say I am, and I don't know what good
they fulfil. I'm afraid this comes of your having Toole to break-
fast. I never liked that move. It was going too far in one extreme.
I always keep the middle course myself. If I wanted an Actor at
breakfast I would have made inquiries as to who stood exactly mid-
way between Toole on one hand, and Irving on the other, and
would have invited him, with a safe man out of the Church—
T-gnm-uth Sh-re for example, and then no one could have been
hurt.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. And a nice cheerful breakfast you would have
had! The three wits would have frightened one another I But I
won't make any more jokes. What do you say to joining us?
Lord D-rby. That would be a step to be long, carefully and
deeply considered. Onoe taken it could not be retraoted.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Of course, you cannot keep the thing always
going. You oan't leave us at the end of our fifth or sixth year, and
go back to the other side.
Lord D-rby. No; I see the force of that objection, and have con-
sidered it. If I join yon now, I must stiok to you,—at least, for
some years.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Sufficient to the day is the Darby thereof, as the
proverb says. Don't look too far ahead, or you '11 get wavering.
Now, what post will yon take?
Lord D-rby. The safest, the most remote from English politics,
and the one about which least questions are asked.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Then India is the plaoe for you. It's pretty hot
sometimes in the Commons, but in the Lords nobody knows anything
about it; or, at least, no one will bother himself.
Lord D-rby. Thanks, no. I prefer the Colonies. Send K-mb-bly
to India. But what about H-bt-kgt-n?
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Oh, H-rt-kgt-n would be only too glad to get out
of it. He says since they began to send over deputations and speci-
mens of the Army, the thing's become very boring. I expeot
him here presently. What time is it? I 've given up carrying
a watch. I always forgot which pocket I put it in, and occasionally
sat on it; so Mrs. Gl-dst-ne took it away.
Lord D-rby. Three o'clock.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Well, H-rt-ngt-n will be here" shortly. I told
him half-paBt two, and he's never much more than half-an-hour
late, now.
[Enter Mr. Ch-ld-rs and Sir Ch-bl-es D-lke.)
Good morning, Ch-ld-rb! How do, D-lfe? Let me introduce
you to our new colleague—the only man of his age who has been in
two Cabinets within the space of five years. Ch-ld-rs, I am going
to hand over the Chancellorship of the Exchequer to you. Fact is, we
are at the end of our tether in the way of sparkling Budgets. No
more leap9 and bounds. Your style of oratory is perhaps a little more
homely than mine, and will better suit the altered circumstances.
Mr. Ch-ld-rs. Thank you. After the success of H.R.H. and
myself at. the War-Offioe, I feel equal to anything.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Yes. But you mustn't make your budget-
speeches too long. The time for that's past, too. I once went to
five hours. But after fifty minutes of your style, clear as it is, the
Speaker would be bound to take note of the evident sense of the
House, and you'd be clotured.
Mr. Ch-ld-rs. I really don't think I ought to take less than two
hours. I should have the House on the hip, as I would keep all
disclosures till the last.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Well, don't oarry it too far.
[Enter Lord H-rt-ngt-n.)
Here we come at last!
A diller, a dollar,
A 'en o clock scholar;
What makes you come so soon?
You used to co ne at ten o'clock,
But now you come at noon!
Lord H-rt-ngt-n. What's that from? Homer Y
Lord D-rby. More likely from a Gaiety Burlesque.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. It's a verse of my childhood. 1 would repeat you
some others if we had time; but we must get this thing settled to-
day. The newspapers have been at least a week before us. You
don't particularly care about the India-Office, do you?
Lord H-rt-ngt-n. Not at all. It's a dreadful bore everyway,
and I believe it's the only place in the world where O'Donnell has
a brother.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Well, yon shall be relieved of it. K-mb-rly will go
to the India Office, and of course O'Donnell cannot get at him in the
other House, and you shall have the War Office. Will that suit you P
Lord H-rt-ngt-n. Yes, as well as anything else, except to be out
of the business altogether. It leaves no time for study, or improving
the mind.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. That's all settled. And now, I don't know that
we 've anything else to do. Oh! I beg your pardon, there's Dilke.
He's done so well at the Foreign Office, he must leave it. W hat can
we do for Dilke Y
Lord D-rby. Dilke reminds me of—(no offence, but rather the
contrary)—Bottom the Weaver. He's ready to take any part.
Sir Ch-rl-s D-lke. My answer to that must be in the affirma-
tive. But though the suggestion does not arise out of the question
on the paper, and is therefore irregular, I may point out to the noble
Lord that there is a difference between " any part" and " all parts,"
and that though I am ready to do any work appointed to me, I like
to have it always under the same flag.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Come, oome! You two will have next two or
three years to quarrel in. Don't begin now. I'll tell you what will
suit you admirably, D-lke. You shall be Minister of Agriculture.
Sir Ch-rl-s D-lke. Agriculture! I know nothing about it. The
market gardens in Chelsea have been built over.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. That you know nothing about it is one reason why
you will suit the plaoe. It will be quite new and with quite a new
man will be en suite. But you don't do yourself justice.
Remember your asparagus. No one within twenty miles of Toulon
grows it bigger or whiter. Will you leave foreign politics and bend
yonr mind to turnip-tops and mangold wurzel Y
Sir Ch-rl-s D-lke. Not without a seat in the Cabinet.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. You shall have it. But you must keep us supplied
with asparagus. Now my Lord and Gentlemen. I think we've
settled everything. If you will exouse me, I will just sit down and
send a line to the newspapers to tell them what they may say to-
morrow morning. L Wrttes.

CHAMBERLAIN AND BUOY'D.
THE CONSTITUTION'S NEW MONTHLY NURSE.
The following is the Real Text of the Prospectus of which a much-garbled
and mangled Version, surreptitiously put forth, has lately deceived
the Press and deluded the Public.
'Tis sweet to hear the honest watch-dog's bnrk
Bay thunderous—monthly—warning to the Town.
'Tis sweet to know he '11 save the 8ocial Ark,
And " crown the edifice "—for half-a-crown.
"The undersigned beg to introduce to your notioe a project for
calling into plav,—or rather, perhaps, into work-the literary and
political talent at present dormant in the ranks of Bow-wowdom.
"It is intended thereby to place more plainly before the Country
the objects of a truly Bow-wow policy. It is needless here to explain
what u the nature and true essence of Bow- wow. Bow-wow is as
old as the hills, older even than 'our glorious Constitution,' almost as
old as platitude and pttitio-principii. Its polity is justified by the
uniform experience of the whole ot mankind—except those pestilent
erratios the thinkers. Bow-wow is, as it were, the watch-dog of—
well, in point of fact, of Bow-wowdom, that is to say, of everything
that'is worth watohing, including Property, Privilege, and all the
more respectable 'isms.' But that watch-dog is at present drowsy,
even torpid. It is not proposed to let this sleeping dog lie, but to
stir it up with a long—literary—pole, till he bays each revolving
moon with a sweet-mouthed welcome worthy of the best Bow-wow
traditions. . ,
"It is unnecessary to indicate in detail the various lorms ot
hostility against which the principles of Bow-wow have in these
dreadful days to contend. We all know them ouly too well. Ihe
policy of the At<ti-Bow-wows— principles they have none—tends to
the withdrawal of Bow-wow from universal domination, the gradual
severance of the bonds that link Bow-woicists all the world over,
and the ultimate separation of Bow from Wow.
in which these several subjeots will be dealt with, may be indicated
by the mere enumeration of suoh names as Cope, R.A. (Art),
Alison, Tcpper (Poetry and Philosophy), Fltrnival, Lord Ran-
dolph Cbuechill (Manners), Lowther, Hyndman, and Tbact
Tobnebelli. Space will be liberally devoted to the consideration
of plans for converting the working-classes to the great, but by
them much misunderstood, principles of Bow-wow.
'•From the purely business point of view the ruling maxims of the
new Magazine will be two:—
1. Money no object.
2. Subscriptions payable in advance.
"The name of the Magazine will be the ' The Big Bow-wow.1
"Suohin its main features is the proposal which is now brought
under your consideration by the undesigned. They are of opinion
that it will conduce in a signal degree to the creation of sound-
that is Bow-wowith—habits of thought, and to the right under-
standing—that is. the understanding, in a Bow-wowish sense, of
those fundamental questions on the true—or Bow-wowith—solution
of which all the most comfortable and respectable arrangements of
Society are founded. They desire to recommend—so far as Bonorous
sesquipedalianism carries weight—this invaluable project to the
hearty support of all those who desire the stable supenncumbenoe
of the superincumbent, the unmoved maintenance of Society s
pyramidal equipoise, the continued union of the traditionally
united, and the consolidation of the vast and varied (vested)
interests of unlimited Bow-wow.

1 These pernicious aim*
will be infallibly attained unless Bow-
wowdom rouses itself to vigorous action; and. appealing, as it alone
can do, to the sound sense and feeling of all possessed of sound
feeling and sense—in other words, to itself— arrests the invasion of
Privilege, and counterbalances the threatened degradation of Palaver,
by disseminating true Bow-wow principles through the community
lit ) riT°\',
"The undersigned are not insensible to the great work which the
Bow-wow Press, and the many other organs of Bow-wow opinion
have done, and are still doing, but they believe that a large space in
Bow-wow literature remains unfilled, which, for the best in-
terests of the rational Universe—or, what is the same thing, of
Bow-wowdom—it is imperative to occupy.
"In furtherance of these views it is proposed to issue a Monthly
Magazine, whose pages shall be devoted to the consistent, homo-
geneous, and uncompromising expression of every legitimate phase
and shade of Bow-wow opinion.
"The conflict between Bow-wowism and all that is not Bow-wow,
however, is carried on not in the field of politics alone, but in every
sphere of mind and every department of manners. The Magazine,
therefore, will not by any means be devoted exclusively to political
Bow-wow, but will aim to nurture and nourish the eternal and
ubiquitous principles of Bow-wowism in Art, Letters, History,
Religion, Philosophy, the Drama, Manners, Agriculture, Bioyoling,
Shove-halfpenny, Shaxsfeare, and the Musical Glasses. The spirit
A Fog in London daytime like the night is,
Our fellow-creatures seem like wandering ghosts,
The dull mephitic cloud will bring bronchitis;
You cannon into cabs or fall o'er posts.
The air is full of pestilential vapours,
Innumerable "blacks" come with the smoke;
The thief and rough cut unmolested capers,
In truth a London Fog's no sort of joke.
You rise by candle light or gaslight, swearing
There never was a climate made like ours;
If rashly you go out to take an airing, #
The soot-flakes come in black Plutonian show rs.
Your carriage wildly runs into another,
No matter though you go at walking pace;
You meet your dearest friend, or else your brother,
And never know him, although face to face.
The hours run on, and night and day commingle,
Unutterable filth is in the air; _
You 're much depressed, e'en in the fire-side ingle,
The hag Dyspepsia seems everywhere.
Your wild disgust in vain you try to bridle,
Mad as March hare or hydrophobic dog,
You feel in fact intensely suicidal:
Such things befall us in a London Fog!
A New Year's Gift.—A seasonable donation is going to be pre-
sented to the inhabitants of West-End, Hampstead, and the Eastern
mburbs of Kilburn, in the shape of a boon which existing circum-
stances must dispose them especially to appreciate. Ihey are
about to enjoy the benefits of a considerable augmentation of Police-
proteotion." Just what they wanted. "A capaoious Police-Station,
recently erected in their midst, and furnished " with a staff of four
inspectors, five sergeants, fifty-seven constables, and with two
mounted-patrols attached," is to be opened by Mr. Harris, super-
intendent of the S Division, on New Year's Day. In view ot the
increasing frequency of burglaries in and around the Metropolis,
they oonld hardly wish to receive a gift more acceptable, opportune,
and appropriate to the commencement of the New Year.
The Cornish Pilchard Fishery, it is stated, has been a continuous
failure. "Only about five hundred hogsheads have been caught.

CHRISTMAS GHOSTS.
'Tis Christmas Eve, a festive
time.
They loved it in the Middle
Ages;
'Tis honoured both in prose and
rhyme,
On many illustrated pages:
But not for me the songs they
raise;
All youth's illusions long have
vanish'd;
Here come dead faces of old
days—
The phantoms that I'd fain
have banish'd.
Here's Fred, who wrote his
father's name,
And cash'd the cheque, the
strangest notion;
Brave Bill, whose burglaries won
fame,—
They sent him gratis o'er the
ocean.
There 's Marmaduke, who made
a noise
By running off with Lady
"Janet;
And Sam by Blaying two small
boys,
His children, in the Isle of
Thanet.
Dear Ghosts! Although your
chains may clank,
May your small failings be
forgiven;
Believe me that you left a blank,
When from your friends un-
timely riven.
So here I pledge each honest soul
That Charon o'er the Styx has
ferried.
Though folks may think, upon
the whole,
It's iust as well they 're dead
ana buried!

occasion?
Last, but very far from least,

THE CORRESPONDENT IN TURKEY.
Quite astounded! Received my "first warning" this morning
from new " Censor of Foreign Correspondents." Don't know what
for. Can the Sultan possibly have got hold of that capital joke I
sent to the humorous column in the Mull of Cantyre Weekly Adver-
tiser about the Golden Horn not having much gold in it at present t
Must really be more careful, or shall have to discontinue connection
with Mull of Cantyre Weekly Advertiser altogether.
Find a new " Central Press Bureau" has been established. Cor-
respondents invited to "correot their apprehensions by authentic
offioial intelligence," and visit the Bureau.
Do so. Find a Pasha in attendance. Asks what paper I write
for. Tell him the Mull of Cantyre Weekly Advertiser—most im-
portant journal. Gets out a map of China, and tries to find Mull of
Cantyre. . . _ T .
Not a bad fellow, the Pasha. Offers me cigar and coffee. I ask
him what official news he can let me have. He replies, lots.
Have I heard that Sultan's constitutional tendency to toothache has
been revived in attempting to please members of Harem by devour-
ing all tho boxes of Rahat-la-Khoum given him for Christmas
presents f I tell him, politely, that this is not quite the sort of news
the readers of the Mull of Cantyre Advertiser will care to read.
Pasha seems really pained. Asks, "what they do care to read t
I reply, "any high political news; state of Egypt; sentiments of
Prince Bismarck, Count Kalnoky, the Czar, &o." Pasha smiles,
apparently pleased; says he can give me plenty of information
which he is sure will be quite new to British Publio on these points.
Egypt, he says, by latest advices, is simply longing to have Turkish
troops instead of British. Lord Duffeein has written private note
to Sultan, expressing his profound contrition for haying ever
thought himself better qualified than the Turkish Ministry to
manage affairs of Egypt. As for the Khrdive, he can hardly be
restrained by sixteen strong attendants and a strait-waistcoat from
rushing to Constantinople, to fall at His Majesty s feet. Prince
Bismarck has sent a telegram (in cipher), to express his desire to
float a new Imperial Ottoman Loan on Berlin Bourse. iheUARS
friendly disposition Bhown by his attempt to borrow the bomb-
proof landau " in which Sultan supposed to. drive to Mosque but
which, as a matter of faot, does not exist, seeing that the »cxtan
is sufficiently guarded by the enthusiastic devotion of all his
subjects." , „ ,, ,T .
Pasha wante to know if I should like any more news t I\ot
to-dav?" "Then good-bye;" and I am to remember that 1 nave
lost one of my three "lives;" and if I lose two more, a special
Bteamer is in readiness in harbour to convey me out pi His Majesty s
dominions. Failure to telegraph the news just given me will be
regarded as an offence against the Censor. Hopes I Bhall not have to
spend my Christmas on Mull of Cantyre, and is sure the M. %f C.
Advertiser's readers will be delighted to receive the authentic official
news whioh is always to be provided at the Central Turkish Press
Bureau."
J. J. & J. Smith's Diaries.—We like Diaries, specially Pepys's
and Evelyn's, but, sinoe the Belt Case, we don't intend to keep a
Diary of our own, but are going to keep Smith's instead. The most
useful are their Office Diaries,—i.e., "Given," of course, "the
Office."

HOLDING THE MIRROR UP TO NATURE!
Encouraged by the toleration accorded by the Publio to the
absurdities in the story of the new piece of Comrades, at the Court
Theatre, it is said that the joint Authors have contrived several plots
of a similar character. In the Drama above mentioned, a gallant old
General is represented as denying fraudulently the legitimacyof his
Son, by his First Wife, "just to please " his Second Wife. What a
clever original idea to bring up your son, as what Mrs. Ramsbotham
would call "a bustard!" So natural! It is supposed that the
following rough ideas will form the basis of some of the future
coming Dramas.
Companions.—An Uncle, who is a celebrated Anatomist, fixes a
murder on a favourite Nephew by producing the bones of his (the
Nephew's) supposed victim. The Nephew is about to be executed,
when the Unole reveals in his sleep that the criminating bones
belonged to a monkey, and not to a man. Reason for Uncle's decep-
tion—the monkey was a pet of his Wife's Father. Denoument—Wife's
Father explains that he had long thought of killing the monkey on
account of his mischievous tricks. The Nephew receives a free
pardon, and embraces his Uncle. Wife's Father sheds tears of joy in
the background.
Pals.—Duke, whose education has been sadly neglected, brings up
his Eldest Son Henry in ignorance of his birth for a certain reason
duly revealed in the last Act. Eldest Son Henrt saves Duke's life
three times, is made a Y.C., a Major-General, a Q.C., and a Royal
Academician. Eldest Son is engaged to be married to'the Daughter
of a Provincial Pork Butcher, but has to break it off as he (the Eldest
Son) is unable to give the names of his parents. Duke, whose educa-
tion has been sadly neglected, in a fit of intoxication reveals the
truth. _ Reason for Duke's deception—unable to master the aspirate,
he shrinks from showing his ignorance bv having to call his boy
"'Ehkt." Dinoument—the Daughter of a Provincial Pork Butcher
marries 11f.nky, and they promise between them to furnish Duke
with rudiments of a good sound commercial education.
Cronies.—Grandfather, by the aid of anonymous letters, and other
questionable means, manages to get Grandson, to whom he is
devoted, accused of forgery, bigamy, and arson. Grandson dis-
covers his aged relative's treachery; and, to save him from expo-
sure, pleads guilty to all the charges. Grandfather's diary falls
into the hands of his Housekeeper, who, by her evidence at the trial,
saves Grandson from conviction. Reason for Grandfather's decep-
tion— he knew that his Housekeeper was fond of the criminal
law reports, and wished, for her sake, to furnish the papers with
that particular sort of literature. Dinoument—Grandson is re-
leased, and gratefully marries the Housekeeper. Grandfather, to
expiate his sins, crams for, and ultimately passes several extremely
difficult examinations in Lincoln's Inn Hall, and ultimately sinks
into his grave a heartbroken Barrister.
Friends.—A Professional Man steals the fortune of his family
(to whom he is fondly attached), and squanders it upon fowl-
rearing, theatre-building, and other crazes of an equally idiotio and
expensive character. Family gradually starve; but being fondly
attached to Professional Man, take a deep interest in his various
pursuits. Professional Man is mesmerised, and reveals the secret
in consequent trance. Reason for Professional Man's deception-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TWADDLESTONIANA; OR, THE LAST OF THE BARON'S.
"I suppose," said the beautiful Duchess of to the Baron, "I
suppose you '11 have your bust done now, won't you P"
No, my dear Duchess," replied the Baron, the merry twinkle of
whose eye showed there was a joke somewhere, which must come
out even if he died for it.
"Indeed! And why not?" asked the Duchess.
"Because—I am not a man to be chiselled," replied the Baron.
The Duchess was carried from the room in convulsions.
"Whichever way the case goes," exclaimed the charming Countess
of X , who was one of the privileged Members of the aristocraoy
on the bench, "I should, if I were Mr. Belt, change my name."
The Baron, bending towards her Ladyship, whispered, "Yes, he
can always speak of himself as Li-belt.
The CounteBs crammed her pockethandkerchief into her mouth,
and retired hurriedly.
ROUND ABOUT TOWN.
The London Docks.
A "tasting order" is rather a dangerous matter, for it is wel^
known, "that the atmosphere of the vaults will affect even a con-
tinued abstainer." So when a genial host invited self and artistic
friend to accompany him on a tour of inspection round the great
store-houses of London, it was decidedly satisfactory to learn that
the party was also to include a celebrity with the appearance and
dash of a cavalry officer, a small perambulating edition of a Popular
Encyclopaedia, and one other amiable, but rather taciturn gentle-
man. It was satisfactory, I repeat, for is there not strength in
numbers?
Before entering upon the labours of the day, this distinguished
Committee of Taste were supplied with a large store of captain's
biscuits. When in doubt, we were to take a bite, and it was hoped
that by following this simple direction we should escape the ill effects
of " an asmosphere which for, &c." But as we decided.unanimously
(I hardly know why) that perhaps it would be better, under the
circumstances, to reserve the wine-vaults for the concluding portion
of our tour of inspection, the anti-Bacchanalian comestibles were
pocketed for the moment.
When we found ourselves in front of the first warehouse on our
list, there was an air of determination upon every face. The Peram-
bulating Encyclopaedia was full of information, which he was anxious
to impart to all of us. He kindly explained that the casks lying
about the yard were made of wood, and was evidently on the point
of adding that the iron hoops were probably manufactured out of
metal, when his lecture was cut short by an invitation we received
to enter a store-room. It was a long and lofty apartment, fitted
with what at first sight'seemed to be the withered branches of well-
grown trees. Here, to our secret satis-
faction, the Perambulating Encyclo-
paedia was at fault. I imagine that
had no one in authority been present,
he would have boldly asserted that
the withered branches were a peculiar
sort of cigars. This would have been
generally accepted as a perfectly satis-
factory solution to the mystery, as
our general notion of the Docks were
summed-up in the words, "Wines and
Queen Victoria's Tobacco Pipe!"
However, someone present teas in
authority, and our entertaining friend
was consequently silent.
"Yes," said the official, who was
kindly taking us round, as if in answer
to a question; "these are teeth!"
The Encyclopaedia was staggered.
Bnt he quickly recovered, ana was
evidently on the eve of entertaining
us with a lecture upon "Dentistry
in some of its branches," when our
guide interposed with the remark—
"No, Sir; minerals have quite superseded rhinoceros horn, and so
now wo have no trade for teeth."
Then why (came the natural question) were the teeth so carefully
preserved?
"Oh, for a multitude of purposes," was the answer. "Surely we
had seen, for instance, ivory brush backs and billiard balls?"
The "teeth" were elephant tusks! And now we talked about
them in a most knowing manner. Our host was so much struck with
one large specimen, that for a moment I feared he might have some
intention of decamping with it. But I felt it was safe. Did not

Boning Ivory.
I know that our host was the soul of honour? Was not he aware
that some one was looking P
"These are evidently decayed teeth," said the Encyclopaedia,
poking a number of more than usuallv battered tusks familiarly with
his umbrella. "They belong to elephants, I think, of either African
or Asiatic extraction.
"No," was the prompt reply of our guide, to whom the first
remark had been addressed interrogatively. "They are dug out of
the ice near the North Pole. Remains of Mammoths!"
"Deeply interesting!" murmured the Encyclopaedia, giving the
relics another, but more respectful poke with his umbrella. Then
evidently as a preface to a lecture upon "Prehistoric Man," he
added, Going, I suppose, to the British Museum?"
"No; to the pianoforte manufacturers, who import them by
tons," was the matter-of-fact reply. "They are not worth much as
ivory, but they do well enough as a facing to the keys!"
This strange announcement so greatly surprised us, that we
decided unanimously that the subject of "teeth" was exhausted.
Wc consequently bade adieu to our courteous conductor, and entered
other store-rooms. Passing up and down hundreds of stone steps,
and visiting numerous apartments, we came across cinnamon, Peru-
vian bark, and all sorts of spices in enormous quantities. Thanks to
the kind inquiries of our Encyclopaedic friend, we learned a number
of the most interesting statistics from the attendants who accom-
panied us. We ascertained how such a thing was bonded, how such
another thing was packed up, how a third article was weighed and
sifted. Our energetic friend was here, there, and everywhere, using
the privilege conferred upon him bv his tasting-order.
"These, said he, putting a handful of small spices unsparingly
into his mouth, "are cloves. I speak under correction, but believe
thnt cloves are used extensively in the manufacture of apple-pies P"
His belief was confirmed by the guide, and then he ventured upon
another piece of information equally valuable, and equally true. At
this point the gentleman of cavalry appearance made a remark.
"Perhaps it is time," he observed carelessly, "to visit the wine
vaidts."
We all (carelessly) agreed with him.
So we quitted the above-ground stores for those in the cellars. And
as we descended we assumed an air of stealthy liveliness, as if hidden
in the recesses of our secret hearts we knew that we were "Dogs!"
But we took care not to be too lively, for fear that "the atmosphere
of the vaults," which it is known to do, might be thought to have
already affected us. We gave up telling one another confidentially
in corners (as we hitherto had done) how greatly impressed we were
with the vastness of the Docks, and the enormous resources of the
United Kingdom, and began to cut a few jokes. We produced our
biscuits, and pretended that their consumption had a sobering effect.
In fact, there is no telling how funny we might not have become, had
not our joy been converted into gloom by the appearance of a cellar-
man of the gravest possible deportment. We had (carrying lamps
attached to flat pieces of wood) followed him into an enormous vault
filled with hundreds of huge barrels. The Encyclopaedia was not to
be put down.
Quite like the crypt of a very dissipated cathedral," he said,
cheerfullv. We encouraged him with our smiles.
The cellarman regarded us with gloomy wonder, and, heaving a
heavy sigh, raised his lamp to the ceiling. It was covered with
masses of fungi. The sigh was infectious, and we became sorrowful.
"Marvellous!" we murmured in awestricken whispers to one
another, and looked (still carelessly) at the two large wine-glasses
the cellarman was carrying tucked up like a half developed conjuring
trick under his left arm.
Apparently pleased at the
dismal effect he had pro-
duced upon us, he relaxed
his features and very
nearly smiled. Then he
knelt down beside a barrel
and tapped it savagely.
He produced a gimlet,
bored a hole in the wood,
and placed a wineglass
before the aperture. A
flow of port immediately
followed. He washed out
the glasses with the wine,
and then filled them in a
lavish manner with the
same clear, inviting liquid.
He offered us the first glass
lJbi}~&

The Cellars and Buyers.
We pointedly insisted that everybody
else should take the initial sip. The Encyclopaedia (in the cause of
science) ultimately was the first to test the vintage. He tested it—
considerably. The second glass was put into requisition, and then
we all tested the vintage—also considerably. A discussion followed
as to whether it was quite old enough. And I am not sure that the
committee (in the cause of science) would not have had another sip,

'The Exit. In Vino Yeritas-h
had they not discovered that their guide had closed the hole, and
was already on his way back to the entrance. Still discussing the
merits of the vintage, we joined arms and followed him. And here
we were greatly pleased to find that although we had been some
time in the vaults, the atmosphere, said to affect even confirmed
abstainers, had not had the slightest effect upon us.
Wc changed our tone from gay to grave on entering the second store-
house, as we expected to meet another serious cellarman. Our new
guide, however, was a contrast to the last, and seemed surprised at the
extreme dignity of our demeanour. Anxious, no doubt, to cheer us up
a little, he was profuse in his offers to "draw us some more." We
found that sherry required (in the cause of science) a far more
careful examination than port. We'discovered also that our Ency-
clopaedic companion was
not the only member of
our party who could de-
liver a lecture. On the
contrary, there was now
a general inclination to
express our sentiments
simultaneously. Even the
taciturn gentleman was
heard to inform the genial
cellarman, that he con-
sidered such and such a
wine "decidedly nutty."
After testing the sherry
thoroughly, we ascended
the upper air, and munched
our biscuits heartily.
"What pleased me
most observed the Encyclopaedia, with grave decision. Then
he paused, smiled slightly, but immediately changed the smile into a
frown. We waited with a sort of languid interest to hear what was
to follow. He smiled once more, said quickly something that sounded
like " 'gotten what to say," and looked very fierce indeed.
Seeing this, my artistic friend, no doubt to create a diversion, told
me that he had been greatly struck by an effect of light and shade
As he had some difficulty in explaining (though profuse of informa-
tion) exactly what he meant, he kindly volunteered to reduce his
impression to a study in black and white. With great rapidity he
executed a picture in his note-book, which he then handed me with
the explanation, "Don't seep
Something o' that sort!" A
fac-simile of the sketch is
preserved in the margin.
The Cavalry-looking Gentle-
man now seemed to think
that sufficient justice not
having been done to the port
(although we had easy con-
sciences about the sherry),
the omission might be sup-
plied by a return to the
vault we had first visited.
This suggestion (in the cause
of science) was enthusiastically adopted, and then someone (I think
it was the taciturn gentleman) proposed that we should go en masse
to the play. .,
This idea was also carried by acclamation.
,As mY note3 are a litlle out of order, I am not quite sure what
followed next, but I know that before parting the Encyclopaedia
summoned us to the door of his cab to tell us "what—meant—just
now to say."
"Strange!" said he, smiling affectionately at us through the
window. Strange—very strange! Atmosphere of Docks don't—
feet anybody I Hasn't 'fected any—us! Not slightest!"
We all agreed with him!

Therb is a market for everything, if one could only find out
where the market is. From the following, whioh appeared in the
■bra, it would seem that stupidity is at a premium, and dulness by
no means at a discount.
RANTED, WOODEN-HEADED FAMILY, and DIALOGUE.
There are several families that we could reoommend, also nume-
rous people who favour us with ancient jokes, vin-funny sketches,
and abusive letters, who are probably as wooden-headed as this
rash advertiser could desire; but, doubtless, his front-door has
been besieged and his street blocked up by a crowd of applicants,
who have, at least, a ohance of earning an honest livelihood.
THE NEW "GHOST CLUB."
(The Substance o) a Discourse delivered to the Serious Young Men's
Intellectual and Social Union by Professor Sellus.)
Some of you, my young friends, perhaps, imagine that Spiritualism
has been killed by the exposure of catching a spirit-exploit per-
formed not long ago at Peterborough. 0, dear, no! Certainly, when
the spirit was caught, the Medium was caught too. And caught out.
Ah, yes. Caught out of her cabinet, and in a disguise. But not,
therefore, Spiritualists plead in their papers, caught out shamming,
they insist that, though the medium in suoh a case acts the spirit,
she may act bona fide. That is, he or she (there being both cook and
hen Mediums) acts in a state of unconsoious metamorphosis. The
•profflabodiM itself in her flesh, and moulds her into its own form
and dimensions with drapery superadded. As Peter Quince exclaims
to bespiritedBottom: Bless thee, Medium, bless thee, thou art trans-
lated! So theorises a Spiritualist of no less note than Mr. Alfred
RusselWallace, the Natural Philosopher. I know what you'll
say. More natural than philosopher. Don't. Supernatural rather
than natural-Spiritualist. See Light-or see by Light. Here's
your lucidity for Mr. Matthew Arnold. Light, more light-on the
subject. Mr. W.'s theory—Wallace's, not Walker's—perhaps
u e2 ,rat',er to° little account of the phosphorised oil, the muslin,
the false beards, and other properties that have been found upon
too many caught-out Mediums.
Spiritualism, my young friends, is still alive and kicking. Add,
if you wish to be brutal, braying. A Society (see morning paper),
entitled the Society for Physical Research, has just been established,
"j»™ view of "inquiring into a mass of obscure phenomena,
which lie, at present, on the outskirts of onr organised knowledge."
There, indeed, you may think they do lie—some of them shamefully.
They include supposed haunted houses, ghosts, and apparitions-
spiritualistic and mediumistio inclusive.
Dr. Johnson once, turning the key of his room-door at Oxford,
heard his mother, absent in the body, call " Sam!" But, he said,
"Nothing came of it." Nothing has come of the old Cambridge
'Ghost Club." Will anything more come of the New Ghost Club,
the Society for Physical Research, so-named—unless Physical is a
misprint for Psychical, or "metaphysical" in the Elizabethan
vocabulary of the Divine Williams r
Now, what will you bet? Given scientific scrutiny under con-
ditions altogether striotly and exclusive of humbug, what will any
Spiritualist among you bet that any one spiritualistic phenomenon
whatsoever will be proven? Will he bet five guineas? Will he bet
five shillings!' Is he game to bet so much as that comparatively
small sum, five bob, on the demonstrable production, by spiritual
agency, of even a single solitary rap?
If anybody, no matter who, were quite assured that the truth or
falsehood of any ghost story, or other marvellous anecdote of modern
date, was ascertainable by experiment, would he willingly wager
five shillings—nay, half-a-crown, on its truth? "Upon my word
'tis true! And what will you lay it's a lie?" Wouldn't almost
everybody's answer be—" Well, a considerable sum of money, if not
any amount you like."
Go to, then. Or come, come, then. Perhaps few people accused
of superstition are really, after all, quite bo credulous as you may
think. What's the faith that isn't worth-five bob?

Christmas Greeting.
[The Artist says that this is a
Scotch joke—quite a side-splitter in
North Britain—as "greeting," in
Scotch, means crying. We hope he

I was perfeshunally engaged at the Lawyers Temple when the
Quern cum for to open the Law Courts, and a fine time we had of it
suttenly. The ellygant lunch, and it wasn't a bad 'un not by no

Cats of the nayburhood, who being of oourse all Lawyers cats never

had to keep gard all night with carving knives drawn, ready like
MacDuff, to defend all our pretty chickens with their or rather our

I may say konseenshusly that we defended many of them to the
werry last extremity, which in this case would of course be the
back bone. We releeved gard every two hours, and if it hadn't bin

"0 Ware and 0 Ware!''
THE SILVER KING;
OE, BEAUTIFUL AS A BUTLEK.
The Drama at the Prinoes9's. written by Messrs. A. Jones—not
the Jones, only A Jones,—and Henry Herman, is, except for one
fault, well constructed, carefully written, admirably placed on the
Btage, forcibly played by the men, weakly by the women, but suffi-
ciently interesting from first to last when once the spectator has
granted the rather improbable
basis on which the whole action
rests,—though 'tis fair to say that
the action never does "rest" any
more than do the villains of the
play, who carry on their work
with unflagging spirit.
The situation in Scene 3, Act I.,
which brings down the Curtain,
and the house, on the termina-
tion of some remarkably fine
acting on Mr. "Wilson Bar-
rett's part, specially as Denver
the Drunkard, is, we believe, tho-
roughly new and original. Denver
nas come to kill Geoffrey Ware, but, stupitied by drink, only wakes
up to find himself alone with the corpse of Geoffrey, who has been
shot by the captain of a gang of burglars. Then Denver, after
stretohing himself, and exclaiming, "Where am I? Where?
?y£?re *.' approaches the body, starts, and echoes his own question.
Ware! Is this Some
Ware, or No Ware, or
Hard Ware? Is it
Summer Ware or
Winter Ware? Good
Ware? A Wash and
a Ware? Here's
Ware—on the floor—
and not in the Great
Bed of Ware!" Gradu-
ally, as these misty
notions—the last re-
maining effects of beer
and skittles at "The
Wheatsheaf," Clerken-
well—clear away, Den-
ver fancies that he has
murdered Ware with-
out himself being a-
ware! Then he
staggers off, and rushes, through the entr'acte, back to his own
house, where he confesses to his wife what he thinks he has
done, and his wife (Miss Eastlake) hurries him off disguised
a» his own butler, the latter generously advancing forty pounds out
of his hard-earned savings to help his murdering master to make
away with himself as quickly as possible.
Mr. George Barrett throughout is excellent —a true artist.
The weak point of the piece is
/"S&, that the sensation scene of the
murder comes in the First Act;
and though there are four Acts,
and about fourteen scenes more,
no such thrilling situation as
this occurs again. Mr. Wil-
lard's Spider, a sort of modern
Robert Macaire, is, as far as we
are capable of judging such
a character, a very clever per-
formance. He is associated
with three comic villains-
reminding every playgoer of
the accomplices of Lesurque
in The Courier of Lyons—
played, without very much exaggeration, by Messrs. Clifford
Cooper, Charles Coote, and Frank Huntley. At the end of
Act II. Denver reads of his own supposed death in a railway
accident, and he is free.

Latest News.
m dead!'

And now comes either a very weak point, or real touch of nature,
aocording to the view of each individual spectator. Being free,
Denver does not at once go to his wife, and say, "Xow we '11 be
off!" nor does he go away to Boulogne, for example—(very few
people, by the way, would think of going to Boulogne, for example;
but we didn't mean that)—taking the name of Jones or Herman,
and from that salubrious sea-port send for his wife and child to
come out to him, and share his new name, and probable fortune.
No; he makes use of his liberty, and of as much as remains of the
confiding Butler's forty sovereigns, to bolt to Australia, leaving
his wife and child behind him to get on as best they can, and
sponge to any extent on Daniel Jaiket, the aged domestic above
mentioned.
The man who takes a cynical view of married life, would at once
say that Denver, with forty pounds in his pocket and free to call
himself anything he likes and to begin the world again as a
bachelor without responsibility, would naturally go away and enjoy
himself; but the Respectable Member of Society, or the inexperi-
enced Lover, would take the other
line and say, "Of course, he might
go away; but, hang it all, he 'd at
once send for his wife and child—
which he could do in perfect safety."
We do not pretend to decide:
Messrs. Jones and Herman make
him go away, give him a silver-
mine, and then bring him back to
his own native land, dressed much
in the style of that luguhrioua
person, the husband of Mrs. Haller,
once well known and indeed popular
as "The Stranger," with white hair,
a Guy-Fawkes hat, and an invin-
cible propensity for wearing dis-
guises and making long speeches
just at a time when everybody most
wants the Play to be "getting on."
However, Mr. Wilson Barrett &
Co. must be satisfied that the Play is getting on uncommonly well.
Then the Silver King disguises himself as a modern "poor Tom's
a-cold," and easily deceives the knowing ones, who open the door
and take him in, when he in turn takes them in, and, mastered by
some unaccountable desire to frighten the villains with a melodra-
matic attitude, he starts up among the bales and barrels in the
marine-store-dealer's place, and exclaims "I am Wilfred Denver!"
which so takes them aback that, though they are armed and are four
to one, they actually let him escape scot free. "Conscience makes
cowards of us all," we know; but, as not one of these blaokguards
ever had any conscience, and as Captain Spider possesses the greatest
sang-froid possible, this situation is comparatively tame.
The remainder of the play is the return of the dead 'un, reminding
us of La Joiefait Peur. Good plays, like good men, have their little
weaknesses, but, making allowance for these, our friends in

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.

A BAD ENDING.
'* Well, William, what 's become of Robert?"
"What, 'avbn't you 'babd, Stat" "No! Not Dkfunct, I hopb!"
"That's just exactly what he 'as done, Sib, and walked off with
heverythinq hb could lay bis 'Ands on!"
A ROSE "WITHOUT A THORN.
{Just about this Festive Season in full bloom.)
Know ye the flower that just now blows,
In the middle of Winter—the Christmas Rose?
A plant, indeed, of the Crowsfoot kind,
Not really a Rose—but never mind.
It blooms out o' doors in the garden bed,
Its petals are white with a tinct of red.
Though it lacketh perfume to regale the nose,
To the eyes right fair is the Christmas Ros§.
A fiddlestick's end for the frosts and snows;
Sing hey, sing ho, for the Christmas Rose!
Your Christmas Rose is a lowly flower,
But a herb with a root of marvellous power,
HelUborus niger—the hellebore,
Which the leeches, both Latin and Greek, of yore,
In high repute as a remedy had.
Withal to physic the crazed and mad.
So lunatics, as the story goes,
They sent to the Isle of the Christmas Rose.
A fiddleBtiok's end, &c.
No Colney Hatch was known to men,
No such institution as Hanwell, then.
No Bedlam had they, but, in Bedlam's room,
Ye might say, the Anti-Bedlam bloom.
Were hellebore still held a herb of grace
That could heal the patients in such a place;
Would the Medical Faculty now suppose
They could mad folk mend with the Christmas Rose?
A fiddlestick's end, &c.
Such virtue in sooth had hellebore,
That health of mind it would restore,
What a goodly New Year's Gift 'twould be
To others, of course, than you and me!
For to most of ourselves the fact is plain,
Great part of the world around's insane.
And what a relief to Ireland's woes
The Shamrock to twine with the Christmas Rose!
A fiddlestick's end, &c.
The Market in the Market.
At last the Duke of Bedford has shown a desire
to meet the public wants, and has praotioally offered
Covent Garden Market and a large block of adjacent
property to the Metropolitan Board of Works. A Board
so largely composed of builders and architects can surely
not resist this tempting offer?
A PERFECT CURE.
Br a species of good luck, for whioh I oan never be sufficiently
thankful, I found myself seated at dinner, last week, by the side of
one of the most eminent Physicians of the day. He was courteous,
good-natured, full of fun and anecdote, knew all about Actors ana
Actresses, to me always a matter of great and almost absorbing
interest, had attended Royalty, and some of the most eminent men
in Art, Science, and Literature. I was, of course, oharmed and
delighted with his conversation, whioh never flagged, but passed
from grave to gay, from lively to severe with the greatest facility.
But what surprised me to a degree that I can scarcely express, was
to see the delightfully free and easy way in whioh he partook of
almost every dish that was contained in a most liberal and varied
menu. There was no declining all the luxuries of the table from
cowardly fear of indigestion, but rich sauces, stewed mushrooms,
PaU-de-foie>-grasx Vol-au-vent of Lobster, all were welcomed and
all, apparently, enjoyed. And as to wines, no nonsense about keep-
ing to one colour for him, but Punch, Sherry, Hock, Champagne,
and Port, were all partaken of, each in its turn, but all, I am bound
to say, in moderation.
As much astonished at what I saw as I was charmed with what I
heard, I ventured, with all that refined delicacy for which I have
been long rather remarkable, to gently insinuate that I should much
like to know to what he attributed his possession of such remarkably
fine powers of digestion, when, without the slightest hesitation or
doubt, he revealed to me the most important and satisfactory infor-
mation that I have ever received in my long and varied career.
In order, said he, to live a life of peace and comfort and enjoy-
ment, perfect peace, thorough comfort, and supreme enjoyment,
without a thought of Physicians, or any such necessary nuisances,
and in a truly blessed state of ignorance of physiology or any such
twaddle, two things, and two things only, are necessary, and those
two things are, plenty of good hard work and plenty of good high
living. With these two in thorough combination every man would
lead a life of thorough enjoyment, and, barring accidents, go to his
rest at a ripe old age without a pang.
But, continued my Guide, Philosopher, and Friend, the misfortune
is, that the large majority of mankind addict themselves to one or
other of these equally necessary matters, but not_ to both; the con-
sequence is that those who work hard without living superbly wear
out their ill-used bodies, and live and die miserably; while those
who live luxuriously and freely.'.without working hard, live a life of
trial and suffering and gout, and their end is not peace.
I never listened to words of wisdom with more perfect faith, and
thanking my kind instructor for his admirable and timely lecture,
to his faith in which he continued to give me a practical example, 1
at once resolved to follow out his suggestions whenever that good
fortune which I have been so long anticipating shall at last arrive.
In the meantime I give the world the benefit of my kind Physician's
prioeless prescription. Ajj Outsidkb.
A Real Christmas Pudding.—Take a ton of Strand mud—there
is plenty to spare—and mix it with two hundred weight of the
experimental stones which are laid about once a month at the Pail-
Mall end of Waterloo Place. Garnish it with a few rotten cabbage-
leaves from Mud-Salad Market, which have been wafted almost into
the inner yard of Marlborough House, and then serve it up at the
first Vestry dinner you can find. You can serve it aocording
to temper.
TO COBBESPONDENTS.—In no case can Contributions, whether MS., Printed Matter, or Drawings, be returned, unless accompanied
by a Stamped and Directed Envelope or Cover. Copies of MS. should be kept by the Benders.
