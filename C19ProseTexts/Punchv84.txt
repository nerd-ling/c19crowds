"A -H-O-O-O-Y !!!" sounded a mighty but mellow voice, over a broad reach of billowy brine, as divinc'y hyacinthine-haed
as the wave-sweeps on a canvas of Mb. Brett's, and leaping as merrily as Wordsworth's daffodils in the welcome
sunshine of a genuine British June.
Mr. Punch was paddling in his own improved " Boyton" about the stretches of the Silver Streak. Toby, in a reduced
copy of his Master's wave-proof, was dutifully dittoing in the rear.
"Methinks 'I hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn,'" said the sea-disporting Sage, pausing in mid-stroke.
But it was the voice of Neptune himself, summoning the All-Accomplished One to a friendly conference, and
Mr. Punch was soon in the presence of the Trident-bearer and his Court, at a sort of nautical "At Home."
"Well, you 're an odd-looking fish!" said the Sea-God, genially. "Hardly knew you at first in that get-up."
"There are odder in your own deeps, if Schiller's Diver reported correctly," responded the Sage, with a pleasant
wink.
"Schiller," said Neptune, " got decidedly out of hit depth in the poem you refer to. Don't you think it would be
more practical to make the best use of my abounding and palpable wealth, than to brood over my hidden and quite conjectural
horrors?"
"Just what we 're trying to do," returned the Sage, promptly. "You've heard, of course, of our Great International
Fisheries Exhibition, of the Piscicultural Conferences, of the combination thereat of the science of learned Professors and the
sense of Royal Princes?"
"Rather!" said Neptune. "But the brine seems to have parched your eloquent lips. What do you say to a liquor up?'
"Do you see any Blue—in my button-hole?" queried the Snge, significantly.
Neptune nodded to a juvenile Triton, a sort of briny " Buttons," who, turning suddenly tail upwards, like a duck,
dived and brought up—a bottle!
"Message from the sea," suggested Amphitrite, archly. TriETrs, with her own shell-pink fingers filled a oonch-shell
with the sparkling contents, and commended the sea-chalice to Punch's willing lips.
"Sure, nothing: on earth half bo sweet is,
So hard for mere mortal to beat is,
As a beaker of wine
From the depths of the brine.
And the hand—may I kiss it P—of Thetis I"
improvised the Sweet Singjr of Fleet Street, taking the Nymph's consent—quite justifiably—for granted.
"See you have been reading Huxley's Address," said Mb. Punch, presently.
"Yes," said Neptune. "He 'a an A.B. among laud-lubbers, if you like. But what lubbers you most of you are! I
envy Ceres. You do make better use of her land than of my water. And yet, as the Professor proves, the yield of a well-
farmed 6ea-acre w much larger, and might be indefinitely greater than that of the finest and fattest of land-acres. How is it?"
"There are queerer fish on land than in sea," said Mr. Punch, reflectively. "A piscatorial guide to humanity
would be a curious volume. The Monopolist Land-shark is greedier than the ' Tiger of»the Sea,' and the flat fish of ocean's
depths are not comparable—in stupidity—with the ' flats ' who allow Monopoly to feed and batten on them. Your eels are

not such wrigglers as are Vested Interests when the hand of Honesty closes on them; and your oyster is about as easy a
creature to stir into self-defensive activity as the ordinary British Citizen, who sits still for the gluttons of Trade to gobble
him up."
"Think of my inexhaustible herring shoals and my ' cod mountains,' one hundred and twenty million fish to the
square mile!" said Neptune. "Can't you teach men to make a little better use of the Harvest of the Sea?"
"It is my business and pleasure to teach everything," replied the Sage. "And I teach, as Thomas of Chelsea wrote
history, by flashes of lightning; only mine is the harmless, lambent, summer lightuing of unvenomed humour."
"How nice!" sighed Amphitrite.
"Tremendous creature, your Master !" whispered Thetis to Toby, of whom the silver-footed Nymph was making a
prodigious pet.
Toby wagged his tail and winked significantly.
"His bark is on the sea," said the old Sea-God, with the shame-faced smile of the unpractised punbter.
"Bit behind the age—in the matter of jokes, eh?" suggested the Sage, cheerily.
"Why, ye-e-s," admitted the Trident-wielder. "Fact is—don't let Amphitbite hear!—we're a bit dull since the
days of Thetis's great son and those delightful Greeks. Electric Cables and ugly Iron clads 1 molest our ancient solitary reign,'
and make things precious slow and stupid into the bargain. I like Bbitannia, there's a dash of the sea-nymph about her.
I like Fishermen, they 're not quite Cockneyfied into commonplace. I like you; you've the depth of my seas and the sparkle
of my billows. That's why I hailed you with tuch energy."
"Couldn't have done anything better or more opportune," responded the Sparkler. "I have htre what instructs and
illumines the World of Men, and will keep you and your Court amused for six months to come.'
"You don't say so!" cried Neptune.
"How aufully nice of you!" murmured Amphitbite.
"I could kiss him!" whispered Thetis in the archly-cocked ear of Tobias.
The younger Tritons, like veritable sea-urchins, turned brine-splashing "catherine-wheels" of riotous rapture which
caused Amphitbite to call them sharply to order.
"I '11 tell t'jc world, Father Nep, what you wisely say about their folly, in the matter of Fish and Fisheries," said
Me. Punch. "In return, this will toll you what I say upon that and every other subject."

MEMS. OF A DISTINGUISHED AMATEUR.
(Extractedfrom his Diaries.)
Christmas, 1819.—A most important year. Early in the Sprinsr
made my first appearance as Richard the Third. Told by the local
reporter of the Mudttone Mercury that it reminded him of the elder
Ki:\n. No doubt it did. Badly supported by the other Amateurs
taking part in the Dishover Hall Am iteur Theatricals.
Midiummer, 1852. — Have certainly matured my style since I
made my first appearance as Richard the Third. Then decidedly
crude, although told, by persons who certainly ouvht to have known,
that I was far better thau the elder Kean. Have added to my
repertoire, Hamlet, Claude Melnotte, Othello, Belphegor, Dazzle,
and Macbeth. Have seen Macready, Charles Mathews, Phelps,
Webster, G. V. Brooke in these parts —well, I don't want to be
hard upon them, but they certainly don't play them quite in my
manner!
Christmas, 1854.—Have recently turned my attention a (rood deal
to Low Comedy. Played in some garrison theatricals, Tony Lumpkin,
and Bex in Box and Cox. Local reporter of the Cnbbageville
Courier insists that "Bcckstone is not a bit like me!" Well,
although I say it who shouldn't, but frankly—he isn't!
Midsummer, 1856.—Got back to the ' legitimate" again. Played
Wolsey, in selection from Henry the Eighth at Mrs. Trevor
Taubtosi'b Theatricals, at 142, St. Augustine Villas, Kensington
New Town. Stage rather small, as Mrs. T. T.'s back drawing-room
is only nine feet bv twelve. However, was magnificent. At least,
go said an Oxford Undergraduate who insisted that i was better thau
Charles Kean. Well, well, Charley is not bad.
Christmas, 1860.~-Still hard at work at my acting. I really do
believe I have played everything in my time. I have got sixteen
large sorap-books full of favourable provincial notices. Rather
annoying I cannot obtain recognition at the hands of the London
Press. However, to quote a well-known line, "A time will come!"
Have recently added Buy Bias to my repertoire. My creation is
considered by the bebt judges to be infinitely grander than Fechter's.
But then allowances ought to be made for Fechter's shortcomings.
It must be remembered that he is a foreigner!
Midsummer, 1865.—Still delighting the provinces. The Gushington
Gazette insists that my reading of Lord Dundreary is infinitely pre-
ferable to Sothers's. Well, I daresay to some people it is, although
it is only fair to Sothrrn to Bay, that he is a very promising
Comedian who one day will turn out an Actor!
Christmas, 1868.—Taken reoently to Irish character. Have
played with "startling success" ([ quote from the intelligent
columns of the Colney Hatch and Hanwell Sentinel) Shaun, Myles
na Coppaleen, and other parts of a similar nature. 1 am told that
Dioy Boucicault came to see me one evening. They say that I
made him cry!
Midsummer, 1872.—During the last six months have been appear-
ing in a round of Charley Mathews's characters. Everybody
delighted. Representative of Humburough Herald told me at supper
that my reading was "replete with humour, pathos, sentiment, fun,
and deep and almost painful feeling." Representative of Hum-
borough Herald is a most sensible person, and I set an especial value
upon his opinion. Of course I have an awful respect for Charley
Mathews, but his reading is not always mine!
ChriUmas, 1880.—Still playing. Really may call myself "the
Grand Old Man of the Amateur Stage." More than thirty years
ago sinoe I first made my appearance, with something actu*lly
approaching nervousness, as Richard the Third. But even in those
days it was universally n 'needed that I was immeasurably greater
than the elder Kean. Well, well, perhaps I was, perhaps I was.
My favourite characters at the preieut moment are Romeo, Bob
Brierly, Sir Peter Teazle, and Manfred. They say I could not be
better in any of them! Well, well, perhaps not, perhaps not! I
only want one thing to complete my satisfaction—a notice in a
London paper.
Christmas, 1882.—At last! The other evening, when I was play-
ing at Lady Loafer's, I saw Slater of the Proscenium taking notes.
There is sure to be a notice! And here it is! Silly 1 did not see
the Proscenium before. Let us read :—" Mr. , as , has yet
to learn how to act. He is the worst amateur that we have ever
seen."!!!!!!

With all these blue, yellow, and scarlet

THE CITY OF DREADFUL DIRT.
A STORY TOLD TO THE MARINES.
(About the Year 3000 a.d.)
There stood a City in the Western Isle,
(This is a tale of Eighteen Eighty-Three, Sirs,)
A City basking broad in Fortune's smile,
With wealth like CecesT/s, power as wide as Cesar's:
A City populous, where forum, mart,
And fane all flowered in tower and florid pinnacle;
Where common souls talked gushingly of Art,
Where taste was fine, and even Faith was finical,
A Sybaritic City, whose Hite
The crumpled rose-leaf held abomination;
A City of two gods, the " Light" and " Sweet,"
And one great rite, the " Tub," whioh meant Salvation.
"An enviable City I" Ah! rush not
Precipitately to a rash conclusion.
That City had one Malebolge-blot,
One foul fatality there wrought confusion,
An Incubus inchoate, palsying, there held sway,
Whose mind—they called it so 1—was crass, chaotic;
With this result: that City proud and gay
Was half the year submerged 'neath mud Nilotic;
Nilotio! Nay, much nastier; for the slime
'Midst which their civic Dragon ramped and straddled,
Outstank, outstuck the stuff where in earth's prime
Its saurian prototypes wallowed or paddled.
It clasped that City like a clammy shroud,
It lay, a common curse, on road and pavement,
Stirred by the tratnplings of the stumbling crowd,
But slab, adhesive, unrelieved by lavement;
As though some mud-volcano had spumed forth
Its spreadiotr spout of foulness o'er it wholly.
Whelming it East, and West, and South, and North,
In one vast muck-pall black and melancholy.
The citizens went forth, with smoke-red eyes,
And through the stodgy slime-slough feebly floundered,
And now they slipped o'er sheets of lcetid size.
And now in gulfs of mire they splashed or foundered.
It stack, oh, how it stuok 1 to heels and soles,
It splashed and sputtered over coats and trousers;
It lay in pool*, and dark insidious holes.
Fit wallowing-pits for Circe's witched oarousers.
It stank, oh, how it stank! scarce Tophet's reek
Were more unsavoury unto dainty nostrils.
Bain fell anew, and then it ran to seek
Confluent floods in wheel-whirled, wind-betost rills.
Or slab or sloppy, it was simply Muck,
Miry, malodorous, unmitigated,
In which, o'er that strange City, splashed or stuck
The matutinal cit or clerk belated.
They bore it, ah! they bore it. It was strange!
A mystic spell was on them, that seemed certain.
They had had vision of Elysian change,
Loss of mire sheet and lifting of fog-curtain,
Vain, vain! That Incubus huge, formless, void,
As the Miltonio Death held empire steady.
Squeegees abounded, and the unemployed
In hosts to handle them stood ever ready.
Taxation's yoke was heavy on that land,
Laws had they, and life s servitors, the Sciences.
Alert and eager ever stood at hand
To champion Cleanliness with 'cute appliances,
And yet—Oh! ultra-classic tragio doom
That might have moved Eumenides to pity—
Nought, down from Science to the simple broom,
Availed to lift the curse from that great City.
Stately and spacious, but slime-fouled, it spread,
Mighty, yet a morass of slush and puddle;
Unswept, unsoraped, unpurged, uncomforted,
A helpless, hopeless prey to Mud and Muddle.
So that for all its splendour and its fame,
Its miles of streets, its piles of bullion ruddy,
It passed, and earned a pitiable name
In History's page as—" Babylon the Muddy!"
[ Whereupon, adds the Scholiast, the Audience of the
Myth-Singer dispersed, some with looks of com-
passion, but the most tcith smiles of derisive

TRIAL BY JUDGE.
(Second and Concluding Portion.)
On the Court reassembling after the Holidays, Mr. Baron Mtddlksomf, who
presided on the Bench, supported by quite a bevy of Duchesses, proceeded to
sum up in the great case of Strap v. Rules, which, it will be remembered, turns
upon the question whether the Plaintiff, a professed cook, was libelled by the
Defendant for insisting that he, the Plaintiff, could not make his own pastry.
Before the formal commencement of the hearing, Mr. Bibstkk, Q..C, asked
his Lordship whether he thought he would be very long in concluding his
address to the Jury. The trial had now lasted about six months, and as he
(Mr. Bibster), with the greatest possible respect to his Lordship, thought that
he (the Judge) might cut it short.
Mr. Baron Muddlbsome was pained at the suggestion. If Mr. Bibster,
who was oertainly one of the brightest ornaments at the Bar (Applause,
in which Mr. Slavey joined heartily.) His Lordship was greatly surprised
at this demonstration; did not Mr. Slavey (who was a Btuff-gownsman cer-
tainly, but yet a member of the Bar) know that the Court was not a theatre P
Mr. Bibster rose to explain. His friend and Junior in this case, Mr. Slavey,
had been of the greatest possible service to him in this action, and he seized the
opportunity of personally thanking him for his exertions. (Renewed applause,
which was immediately suppressed.)
Mr. Baron Mudslesome, who regarded Mr. Bibster as one of the brightest
ornaments of the British Bar, was delighted to find that he (Mr. Bibster) had a
feeling heart even for an inferior.
Mr. Bibster had nothing further to add, except that he trusted that his
Lordship would make his concluding remarks as brief as possible. His Lord-
ship would notice that, for a reason it was unnecessary to mention, his learned
friend, Mr. Bustle, Q.C., had already left the Court. He trusted, earnestly
trusted, with the utmost respect to the Judge, that his Lordship would not so
prolong his remarks that other counsel might be forced, reluctantly forced, to
follow the example which had been set so excusably by his learned friend, Mr.
Bustle, Q.C.
Mr. Baron Muddlesoiie was most anxious to render himself agreeable to all
persons of distinction. He trusted that he had been amusing and instructive

to the Ladies of Title who had done him the great honour of sharing
the Benoh with him P
A Duchess was here understood to murmur that his Lordship had
carried personal courtesy to its utmost limit.
Mr. Baron Muddlbbome was believed to return his heartfelt
thanks, but as the remarks of his Lordship, although offered with
gratified gesticulation, were uttered sotto voce, their exact meaning
did not reaoh the box reserved for the reporters of the Public Press.
Mr. Bibster, with the greatest possible respect, would be glad to
learn whether his Lordship thought that he would be able to offer
his concluding observations by Easter f
Mr. Baron Muddlesome had no doubt that he would finish his
remarks at that very sitting. (Applause, which teat with difficulty
suppressed.) He was pained, deeply pained, at that demonstration.
It must be remembered that it was his duty to address the Jury on
many points of interest. He might here mention that he trusted
that the twelve Gentlemen who had so patiently followed this case
in this Court, had enjoyed themselves at a recent ceremonial.
The Foreman of the Jury, on behalf of his oolleagues, acknow-
ledged gratefully the courtesy extended to them by his Lordship in
obtaining for them tickets of admission. He wished to add that the
summing-up of his Lordship so far had been quite up to the mark.
Mr. Baron Muddlesome was mnch gratified at this observation.
As to the tickets, it would be obvious to the Gentlemen of the Jury
that his position in Society enabled him to exert some influence in
obtaining favours of a pleasing oharaoter.
Mr. Bibster, with the greatest deference to his Lordship, would
suggest that, after all this interesting but desultory conversation, a
fitting opportunity might now be offering itself for an adjournment
for luncheon.
Mr. Baron Meddlesome, after consultation with those associated
with him on the Bench, ventured, with their Graces' permission,
to differ with Mr. Bibster. He would now continue his observa-
tions on the case. (Applause, which was immediately suppressed.)
It would be remembered that he had already expended some time
in explaining the French of some of the maynoos that had been
put in. And here he might remark that it was to be hoped that,
if any of the Gentlemen of the Jury had dined out during the
trial, they would preserve their maynoos, as, considering the
deeply interesting character of the proceedings which had been
honoured by the attention of so many persons of distinction, thoae
cards would be of great historical value. (Laughter.) He would
now turn his attention to the evidence of the experts. It would be
remembered that the Defendant had oalled several professed cooks,
who, on account of their great ability in the culinary oalling. had
been awarded the title of Cordongs Blues. These Cordongs Blues
had declared that the dishes said to have been made by the Plaintiff
could not possibly have emanated from his hands. Now he (his
Lordship) regarded this testimony with much suspicion. It was no
doubt true that they had devoted their lives to the pursuit of
cookery, but for all that he regarded their testimony with the gravest
suspicion. In this case many persons of the highest distinction and
the noblest birth had been present in the kitchen while the Plaintiff
was actually employed in putting artistio merit, in the shape of
sauoe and other ingredients, into the various dishes that had occu-
pied their attention for so long a time. He had no doubt that Her
Majesty and the Princess Beatrice were perfeotly competent to
give an opinion upon a plar. He might whisper, with the greatest
possible respect to the Throne, that he had been in a position to
learn ocularly that the Queen herself occasionally condescends to
visit the palatial knosine, to stir the Christmas pudding I (Enthu-
siastic applause.) Under these circumstances, he could but come to
one oonolusion—that however competent Cordongs Blues might be
to make a maynoo, their evidence could be of no sort of value when
weighed in the scales with the evidence of the general Public
(Renewed enthusiastic applause.) Why, it was quite possible that a
Cordong Bleu might be called Snooks! As a peroration, he would
only quote the opinion of the greatest literary man of the present
day, who had written—" Physicians can tell best the merits of other
physicians, and scientific men can best judge of soientitio matters;
but the publio, if fairly educated, are seldom wrong in their
verdicts." So with the intimation that he (the learned Judge)
intended, for the future, to listen only to the voice of the Publio when
he felt out of sorts and required a doctor's prescription, he dismissed
them to consider their decision.
Almost immediately the Jury found for the Plaintiff, and the
distinguished audience dispersed, after exchanging congratulations
with the utmost cordiality.

ing out from Southampton, by their steamer African, to the Govern-

DRURY LANE AND ELSEWHERE.
Sinned-badly, and my Pretty Jane—Eyre. The Imperial

What has become of our Pantomimists? Wherever they may be,
they do not come to the front at Drury Lane. Even Mr. and Mrs.
D'Aubajt do more in the speaking and singing than in the genuine
pantomimic line, and young Lauri is rather
a clever acrobat than a pantomimist. Mr.
Harry Payne is the last of the Pantomimists,
and so very much the last, that, even when
four Scenes had been omitted on Boxing
Night, he did not make his appearance as
Clown until a quarter past eleven.
We sincerely sympathised with Mr.
Augustus Harris on that terrible first night,
when the Pit was angry, the Gallery tired,
and nothing would go right on the stage.
No doubt by this time everything works
smoothly, and the Pantomime, including the
"comic business"—as if the first were the
"serious business" of the evening until the
Clown comes on and says, in effect, "Now
we '11 play the fool!"—is probably all over
at a reasonable hour.
But to what was this first night's failure
attributable Pit began well enough—indeed,
brilliantly; but it went, as far as acting and
singing were concerned, from indifferent to
bad, and from bad to worst, until the climax
came in an utterly idiotic scene, where comic
music-hall talent, represented by Arthur Roberts, James Fawn,
Herbert Campbell, Nellie Power, Yesta Tillrt, associated
with one ordinarily good comedian, Harry Nicholls, appeared to
be doing anything that came into their heads at the moment, with-
out rhyme or reason, until it resembled rather the impromptu

thousands, and the Manager would reap a far greater harvest with
far less outlay, than he will even now, with the one scene of
gorgeous speotacle whioh leavened the almost intolerable amount of
stupidity exhibited on the Boxing Night performance of Sindbad.
What became of the story after the first Scene we haven't the
slightest idea. We saw the Old Man of the Sea, who, however, did
not get on Sindbad's shoulders, as he might have done had his
representative been a boy " got up " as an old man; and then, after

an interval, we saw the Gigantic Roc, with a deal of fumbling, fly
off with Sindbad, who then and there disappeared from the story, as
we next recognised him dressed up as Britannia, singing a patriotic
song, and subsequently in the wig and gown of a barrister, doing
nothing particular in an Egyptian police-court. Occasionally we
heard a line or two, and occasionally somebody mentioned the name

and perhaps, too,
the Author may have heen called in to suggest the wit and humour
suitable for pantomime, which the unassisted music-hall intellect
evidently cannot invent for itself.
Much better another time to engage Mr. Arthur Roberts, who
is really funny, alone, as one of a regular pantomimic troupe. The
music lacked spirit, specially the performance of " God Save the
Queen" in the Overture. Former Conductors, like Mr. Levey or Mr.
K \hl Meyser, have turned round, faced the audience, and led the
National Anthem with a Jullien-like enthusiasm that carried the
audience a quarter through the Pantomime; but this "go" was
lacking on Boxing-Night. Again, whenever there is a " stick " on
the stage—(and how many "regular sticks " there were!)—a sharp
Conductor should be ready to fill up the hiatus, and drown delay
with a storm of wind, and sink disapprobation by a display of brass;
but, unfortunately, when there was a hitch in the scenery or in the
action, there was a corresponding stoppage in the Orchestra, which
made the deficiency all the more noticeable.
And now for the brilliant side of the Show. The Grand Scene of
the Procession of the Kings of England, which royal personages,
to judge from their masks, were all of them closely allied to the
ancient Hebrew race, and the review of the little soldiers, played by
children, and therefore all infantry, is one of the most complete
spectacular effects ever seen at Old
Drury. It is magnificent — e'eft

Young Lauri's four-footed feat of
going round the house is the acro-
batio hit of the piece. The transfor-
mation scene, by H. Emden, is very
effective, and, if less splendid than
heretofore, it has the advantage of
depending less on mere mechanism.
As is usual in Pantomimes, all
sorts of advertisements are intro-
duced on the stage: but it was a
curious kind of oompliment—whether
suggested as "business " by Author,
Manager, or Actor—to the Proprie-
tors of the journal with the Largest
Circulation in the World, for Abthub
Roberts to haul up the Daily Telegraph for a very small sail.'!

As a Giant and four scenes were deliberately omitted on the first
night, and, as we couldn't stay for Mr. Harry Payne's Harlequinade,
we may fairly say that we have not as yet seen the Pantomime as a
whole. After a second visit we hope to be able to give a far more
favourable report of the Drury Lane Annual than we could con-
scientiously do, judging from what we saw of it on Boxing Night.
Still, whatever may be the present result, we are sure that all,
speaking for the children, for themselves, and for the Art asso-
ciated with the Christmas traditions of Old Drury Lane, will join

us in asking Mr. Harris to give us another time more of the genuine
old Pantomime and less of the modern Music-Hall.
My Pretty Jane—Byre, at the Globe, is not a pleasant piece. It
is confusing to those who have not read the novel from which it
is avowedly taken, and to those who have, the " confusion becomes
worse oonfounded," as Mr, Rochester would no doubt say, did he not
generally use an even stronger expletive in con-
veying his meaning. Following the directions of
Mrs. Glasse, Mr. Wills hag "first caught his
Eyre'' in the person of Mrs. Bernard Beere,
who is no more like the plain, undersized little
creature in the novel than Juno of Olympus is
like the female Midget lately exhibiting at the
Westminster Aquarium. Mr. Charles Kelly,
on the other hand, no doubt has the personal
peculiarity inseparable from Mr. Rochester, still
on this occasion his face is not sufficient in itself
to constitute his fortune. Of the other characters
little need be said. Miss Carlotta Leclerq, as
Lady Ingram, obtains a good deal of fun out of
an eccentrio bonnet; and Mr. A. M. Denison,
as Lord Desmond, gives quite a Christmassy
flavour to the production by treating his part
d la mode de pantalon. Mr. H. E. Russell, as
the Rev. Mr. Prior, looks and aots like a Wesleyan Archbishop
gone wrong.
For the rest, the piece leaves an impression on the mind of aimless
exits and entranoes, feeble dialogues, old—very old—Joe Millers,
diluted sermons, and stale sentimentalities. But there is one
startling exception to all these amiable little weaknesses. At the
end of the Seoond Act the scream and appearance of Miss D'Ai.malne
as Rochester's maniac wife, are simply terrifying. The effect of
the fearful peal of laughter, with the subsequent awful apparition,
upon the house is electrifying. So powerful is the sensation pro-
duced, that when the cry is repeated in Act III. pur et simple, the
Curtain falls amidst thunders of surprised applause.
With the exception of the scream just mentioned, there is abso-
lutely nothing remarkable in
the new play. Consequently,
Mr. Wills might choose, as
an appropriate second title to
his drama (as there is already
a play bearing the same first
name in existence) the well-
worn line—Vox et prceterea
nihil! Or why not nave big
heads, and play it as a Panto-
mime?

songs. The story of Valentine

CHARITY BALLS AND CONCERTS.
From a letter addressed by the Local Government Board to the
City of London Union, it appears that " at some of the Metropolitan
pauper infirmaries and asylums for the sick it is the practice at certain
seasons of the year to permit entertainments to which the friends of
the officers are invited, and at which music and dancing are allowed."
This practice is discommended by the L. G. B., as likely to produce a
"prejudicial effect" on the sick poor. Possibly so, if the Matron,
Master, and Beadle, with their guests, are accustomed to dance over
the patients' heads or elsewhere near enough to disturb them.
But the newspaper paragraph above quoted bears the heading of
"Music and Dancing in Workhouses." Now, to these relaxations
in those institutions at certain seasons of the year there can be not
the least grave objection. For instance, at the present festive season
might not even paupers be permitted to enjoy the festivities of musio
and dancing if they have the heart to P The idea of a Workhouse
Ball at least once a year—a Workhouse Annual Ball—might even
seem to any benevolent Board of Guardians a happy thought. Sets
of Workhouse Quadrilles and Workhouse Waltzes might be composed
expressly for suoh entertainments, and the dance-music might
include a Menuet de la Maison d'Industrie. It might do the hearts
of some of the parishioners good to attend, and see the more youthful
of the gallant inmates of a Workhouse salute their partners in a
oountry- dance under the mistletoe-bough, at a bond fide Charity
Ball.

UP A FAMILY TREE!
Mr. G. A. Haio, of Pen Ithon, Radnorshire, has been supplying
the papers with some strikingly interesting facts relating to the
pedigree of Lord Wolseley; but, as he only connects the illustrious
soldier direotly with William the Conqueror, Chaeles the Bold,
Charlemagne, Her Most Gracious Majesty, and a few dozen other
distinguished historical personages, it must be obvious that his
acoount is as sadly garbled as it is meagre and incomplete.
Turning, however, to Burkes Stranded Gentry, Chap. XXIX.,
p. 371, Seotion 5, we find a good deal more to the purpose, in the
graphio account there given of how the first notable Wolsklet, a
twenty-fifth cousin in the third degree to the present Baron, saw the
Ark off, and was curiously enough never heard of again. But so
remarkable, even in those remote times, seems to have been the
recuperative powers possessed by the family, that a Wolselet is
referred to by profane historians as having appeared suddenly
among the plagues of Egypt. And this is probably the same
LiNbEr Wolselet, who, according to the Chairman of the Arundel
Society, is known to have beaten Cosfucios at Backgammon,
settled in the Isle of Wight, and, alter looking on at the Battle of
Blenheim, founded the fifth Merovingian Dynasty in conjunction
with an Irish gentleman of distinction, whose name has, by some
mischance, not been handed down to posterity. Indeed, the here-
ditary record of the family at this stirring period of its history is
most interesting, and no apology is needed for quoting it bodily as it
stands in Stanger's excellently compiled quarto edition of Miller's
Qenealogia Jocosa, which furnishes the following significant table:—
Tisiour the Tartar (forty-first Baronet)
Charles the Oliver Cromwell-Margaret of Henry the
Bald | Wapping Ninth
Mr. O'Brien (Waterford Branch)
Madame Tussaud=Philip of Sweden
Nai'olioh Admiral Howe | Mr. D'Oylt Carte
Heliogaralus = Jane Eyre
I
The Deputy Chairman of the North-Eastern Railway Company,
from whom, by different branch lines, Arabi Pacha and the present
Baron Wolseley are both respectively descended.
From the above it will be seen at a glance how profoundly inte-
resting and historically important is the nature of the information
collected by Mr. G. A. Haig—information which these few addi-
tional but most material facts, it tis to be hoped, will not only am-
plify hut elucidate. Mr. G. A. Haig deserves the appreciative
thanks of all reasonable men. We hope to hear from him on this
subject again.
THE NEW PASSENGER.
Guard Punch, loquitur:—
Come, up with you, youngster! The box-seat at night
Seems a little exposed for so youthful a traveller;
However, your Jehu will Bee you all right.
Whither bound? That's a crux of which he '11 be unraveller.
Old Edax is certain to tool you right through,
He '11 not tpill the coach, boy, nor leave you the lurch in;
But, as for the weather that's waiting for you,
Who knows, my poor urchin?
Most probably mixed. That old gentleman there,
Like a ghost through the darkness phantasmally hooking it,
Would tell you his Btage had its shifts, foul and fair.
Could he take a fresh seat, he'd scarce hurry at booking.it.
But you, boy! to youth on a box-seat-there's bliss;
Tchick I Rootletetoot! Tally ho! and all that is
A rapture whose capture what youngster would miss?
'Tis Age says "Jam satis."
Up! Edax won't wait, and his tits won't stand still.
You've a long spin before you,—I hope you '11 enjoy yourself.
The world sees your start with a world of good will,
With wonder, hope, fear, as to how you'll employ yourself.
Bon voyage! be Bure, is the general wish.
Edax gathers the ribbons, and calls to his cattle,—
One mellow " root-tootle," one dexterous " swish,"
And we 're off with a rattle!

MIDWINTER ANNUALS.
"Charitable Appeals," so-called—really, appeals to charity—
in seasonable dearth of news, serve to fill space in the morning
papers. Among them mav have been noticed an "Appeal" on
behalf of the "North Pole Mission District Sunday Sohool." A very
useful charity, perhaps; but has missionary enterprise, then, suc-
ceeded in making the discoveries in the polar regions which may be
conceived to constitute a reason for the existence of a Mission and a
Sunday School operating in a sphere of usefulness corresponding to
the Arctic Circle? Of course, if the northern ice-fields are not too
far North to afford Missionaries a field, there may be some people
sufficiently blest with money, and not too far North themselves to
subscribe some of it to North Pole Missions.
DIES NON.
In an occasional leader, the other day, a morning contemporary
made the passing observation that:—
"The Puritans, who first imported into the weekly anniversary of the
Resurrection, the austerity and gloom of the Pharisaic Sabbath, did their
beet at one time to suppress the annual commemoration of the Nativity."
A substantially just remark, no doubt; but how can Sunday or any
other day be made out a " weekly anniversary?" The journal in
which Sunday is so denominated is evidently one whose staff has
been selected entirely without heed to the principle of the illiberal
intimation that " No Irish need Apply."

NOTIONS FOR THE NEW YEAR.
{By a Gentleman on the look-out for something to turn up.)
jAXCARr.—Twelfth Day on the 6th. Why not apply to leading
Stationers to be made " Designer-in-chief for Twelfth Night charac-
ters " t 9th, Fire Insurance expires. Surely, ought to bo able to
secure office of " Inspector-General of Arson to some of the Com-
panies? 13th, Cambridge Lent Term begins. Post of "Backer of
Bills (for a consideration in ready money down) to impecunious
Cantabs" should be lucrative. Failing all these schemes, write
to my Mother for an advance.
February.—1st, Pheasant and Partridge Shooting ends. Idea for
a Company (of which I am to be Managing Director), "The Country
Squires' Game Protection Society." If the Squires don't bite, try
the other interest with " The Association for the Encouragement of
Poaching in all its Branches." If the above doesn't turn up
trumps, apply to my Father for a remittance.
March.—21st, Hilary Law Sittings commence. Why not ask the
Lord Chancellor to make me " Repairer in Ordinary to the Wool-
sack "? Duties: See that somebody keeps it nice and tidy, and
receive myself five hundred a-year for the trouble. Surely, there
are lots of snug little posts of this sort flying about. If this idea
fails, apply to my Sister for a little money to go on with.
April.—5th, Dividends due at Bank. Organise a "Personally-
conducted tour to Italy and back for £5." Distribute Coupons
franking my party (per long sea-route) as far as Boulogne, and
see them comfortably on board. Devote some of the remainder of
the proceeds of my enterprise to a ticket taking me safely out of
reach of my constituents—on their return to look after me! Should
this oapital notion come to nothing lucrative, apply to my Brother
for a small loan, to be returned at two days' date, bearing sixty
per cent, interest.
May.—9th, Half-Quarter Day. This suggests an eight—aquatic.
Get up a Champion Contest for International Crews from all parts of
the world. Magnificent Cup (supplied by advertising jeweller) to be
given to the Eight that wins the race (an annual one) sixteen times
in succession. Until the Contest is decided, keep the Cup (valued at
one thousand guineas) myself. For fear of accidents, deposit it (
loan) with Mr. Attenbobough. 13th, Whit Sunday. On the
Monday apply to Mr. Gladstone, or Mr. Spcboeon, or Lord
SiiAFrESBURY, or Lord Chief Justice Coleeidoe, for funds with which
to start a comic paper. If none of these oelebrities quite " see their
way" to adopting my idea, utilise my introduction to them by
obtaining orders for a wine merchant on commission. If these
oapital notions come to nought, write an earnest letter to my Aunt,
begging her to save me from starvation.
June.—18th, Battle of Waterloo. Something to be done in the
Military Line. Why not start a "Staff College for Officers of
Volunteers?" Easily obtain applicants by designing a smart uniform
for the students—gold epaulettes, scarlet tunics, and plumed cocked
hats. Students to be allowed to wear their uniforms at Fancy Balls.
In event of failure, write a' letter to my Uncle, threatening to
commit suicide on his doorstep, when he will have aU the pain and
discomfort of an inquest on his premises, unless he immediately
forwards to me a letter, post paid, containing a Five Pound Note.
July.— 13th, The Berlin Treaty signed, 1878. Write to Bismarck,
offering services as a spy. If accepted, obtain employment at the

The Civic Festive Season.—Dinner at

of real turtle-soup, fish, flesh, fowl, and
innumerable other delicacies, besides the
good old English Christmas fare, roast-
beef and plum-pudding.
Financial Reform.—Begins at home
with every financier not a fool.
Foreign Office at teupenoe an hour, and supply His Highness with
copies of any secret despatch that may be given to me to be copied.
Should my proposal be deolined with thanks," take a top-floor in
St. James s Street, and start a new institution to be called "The
Senior Whites and Boodles Club." Collect Entrance Fees and First
Years' Subscriptions, and wind up the affair as speedily as possible.
If I find these ideas a blank, write to my Cousins a circular letter
commencing, " You are the only person in the world from whom I
would ask a favour," soliciting pecuniary contributions.
August.—llth, Dog Days end. Get up a Canine Show, not under
the patronage of the Kennel Club. This should obtain the hearty
support of hundreds of unsuccessful dog-breeders. Sell all the
exhibits to fanciers living abroad, and depart with the proceeds to
South America. Hlh, St. Bartholomew. Suggests a hospital.
Obtain admission to one of these institutions, and, after I have been
there a fortnight, threaten the resident staff with exposure unless I
am fed with all the game presented to the patients by illustrious
sportsmen. If neither of these plans yield anything, write to the
richest Mr. Smith I can find, claiming relationship with him through
a reoently deceased nobleman.
September.—9th, Sebastopol taken, 1855. Appeal to the publio to
provide funds for a good dinner to be given to Crimean heroes.
When I have collected the contributions, dine with myself, having
failed to discover the warriors in question. Anything that may be
over, devote to a "benevolent object." remembering that "charity
begins at home." If I again find my ideas unproductive,
write to my dearest friend asking for my passage-money to Aus-
tralia—and promising on my arrival at that distant colony to stay
there.
October.—\0th, Oxford Michaelmas Term begins. Go shares with
the President of any South American Republio to establish a new
University to be called by the same title as the Dark Blue School of
Learning. Then sell Degrees freely to anyone who will purchase
them. "M.D.'s" and "D.D.'s" should fina a good market amongst
the ambitious but unlearned. If my coffers are still unfilled,
write to the best-known philanthropist I can remember, asking
for a donation, and promising to spend half of his contribution in
advertising his bounty.
November.— 9th, Lord Mayor's Day. Make a grand effort to
obtain something from the City. Offer to teach Aldermen when and
how to use the aspirate, in return for election to the post of Remem-
brancer. If I promise to regard the post as ornamental rather than
useful, I should have no difficulty in securing their suffrages. 26th,
Prince Teck born. "Teok" suggests " tick." Start a Co-operative
Store on the credit system. Send circulars to the inmates of Colney
Hatch and Hanwell—from whom I may expect cordial support. If
[ fail once more, write a letter (as a very last resource) to the Secre-
tary of the Charity Organisation Society.
December.—2\st, Shortest Day. Devote it to making up my gains
for the past year. No doubt I shall find plenty of time for this
probably purely honorary occupation. Lastly, to show that my
hopeful impudence has no bounds, enclose in a letter a contribution
to Mr. Punch—for his waste-paper basket— and ask to be paid for it 1

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ROBERT'S CHRISTMAS STORY, WHICH IS A FACT.
This being rather a slack time with Gents of my perfesshun, I was
a-setting alone in our cosy little dining-room afore the tire, a-reading
of your emusing Publycashun, when a Gentleman rashes in and he
says to me, sayB he, "Waiter, can I make you my friend?" "Why,
suttenly, Sir," says I, a-glanoing naterally at his weskit pocket, but
he didn't seem to understand the delicate elusion. "Well, then,"
says he, "wat's the best thing for a bad cold—starving or feeding?"
I natrally, without the slitest hesitashun, says " Feeding." "What
food?" says he. "Why," says I, "a good bason of hot thick
Turtel soup and half a pint of punch." "Then, bring it," says he,
and I hrort it. "What's to toiler ?" says he. "Leave that to me,
Sir," says I. "So I will," says he.
So I gos and gives the orders, I then oums back, and, while he ate
his boiling hot soup, took the opportunity of having a good look at
him. He was a fine tall handsome fellow about 35 years old, quite
the gentleman in every way, with the whitest hands as I ever seed
on a man's arms, but with such a fearful cold on him as beat all I
ever heard. Lawks how he did sneeze and corf and blow, and then
blow and oorf and sneeze I It was summat a'most awful to witness
and lissen to.
Presently, wile I was handing him his cutlette o tomart, he says,
"What's your name?" "Robebt, Sir," says I. Then says he,
"Robkrt, can I have a bed here?" "Certainly," says I; "about
as cosy a one as in all London!" Then let me have the best you've
got," says he; "and make a roaring fire in the room, and take off
the sheets and put on 2 extra blankits." "All right, Sir, says I,"
and I orders it.
I then gave him a salmy of woodoock, whioh he said was the best
he had ever tasted, and whioh he finished off to the werry last,
together with a pint of our dry monopoly. I followed this up with
a lovely out of mutton, and that again with a Fezzant and a pint of
our werry finest Burgundy, and he didn't leave much of either. I
then gave him a nioe little plum pudding about the size of a cannon
ball, with brandy sauce, and a pint of our '31 port with his cheese.
By this time such a ehansre had cum over my poor patient as one
oould ardly credit if you didn't see it. His sneezin and his coffin
and his blowing was amost stopt, and his cheeks was as rosy red as
a peeoh, and his eyes was as bright as dimens, and he larft as he
eat, and he larft as he drunk, and acshally made me take a glass of
wine with him! Drecly he had finished his dinner, without waiting
another minnit, I sees him up to bed, when, first telling me to call
him peroisely at 8, he littorally tears his close off, and then jumps in
between the blankits and is fast asleep, as I oould werry distinoly
hear, afore I oould have said Tom Robinson, if I had wanted to say
it, whioh of course I didn't. I tucked him up comfortable, took his
candle away for fear of accidence, and bo left him.
The nex mornin, at 8 o'clock punkshal, I knocks at his door, hut
fitting no anser, I gently opens it, when as the Poet says, "On ye
G >ds and little Fishes, what a site met my view!" for there was
nobody there! To rush down stares was the work of only a few
minutes, though I has a great dislike to hurried stares, but nobod v
could give me any noose of my runaway with the bad cold. Of
course when 1 began to think, when it was two late as usual, nothink is
easier than for a reel Geutlemau to walk out of his hotel of a morn-
ing without paying his Bill. If anybody seed him would they like
to stop him and say, hi 1 where are you a-going to? Of course not,
Bpeoshally if the said Gentleman stands 6 feet 1 in his 2 stookings.
Need I say as how as the Guv'nor was that angry that he used
langwidge to me that in his oarmer moments I dessay he repented
on, tho' somehow he has forgotten to menshun it. Well, as may be
supposed, what with the 'noyance of being swindled, let alone losing
my own little fee, and the chaff and sarkastn of my fellow men, that
day was the longest to me, altho one of the werry shortest to all
other people, that I efer spent.
But what says our great Pbilosefer, "When things are got to
there wust they're alius sure to get mended." And so it was with
me, for the following morning I received a letter to this remarkable
effec:—
"Mr good dear Roberto, _ _ , Herts.
"Your wise counsel and your judicious and fatherly treat-
ment of me yesterday, enabled me to keep the most important
engagement of my life with the most perfect satisfaction to all con-
cerned. I awoke thoroughly well and in excellent spirits just in
time to catch my train, but much regret that in my necessary haste
I forgot to pay my little bill. I enclose a £10 note with which please
settle it, and accept the balanoe as a small recompense for a most
important service. Yours most truly,
"C B M ."
Something in the ring of the tone of the letter awoke my suspicions,
and looking in a certain collum of the Timet for 2 or 3 days suck-
sessively I ewentually read the following enouncement:—
"On the inst, at , Hertfordshire, by the Right Rev. the
Bishop of Bullock Smithy, assisted by the Reverend J. Chad-
band, M.A., and the Reverend E. Stiogins, A.M.; C B
M , Esq., younger son of A B M , Esq., of Hall,
shire, to only daughter of Sir Gorgius Midas, Knight, of
Place, Herts."
Of course my natteral dellicassy suggests the consealing of the reel
names, but in every other respeo I oan say with the sillybrated
Prestodigyertatos, "There is no decepBhun I" Robert
P S.—Should any one of your many hundreds of thowsens of
readers be a sufferer from the same calammity as Mr. C. B. M., Esq.
was a-sufferin from, weather in the same hintristing oondishuns or
not don't matter, and will communekate with me at the old edress.
Fleet Street, I shall be happy to treat him on the same liberal
terrums, which he will find nicer, effectiver, oumfertabler, and
cheaper in the long run than taking all the nasty Doctor's stuff in
Herpothecarry's Hall. ^
THE BIOGRAPHICAL BOGIE;
Oh, What it mat soon come to.
Scene—An Enterprising Publisher's Sanctum. Enter a Spirited
Literary Executor.
Enterprising Publisher [with caution). Ha! Good morning, Mr.
Splashum. Well, since I wrote to you yesterday, I've been thinking
the matter well over, and I want you to understand, before we go
further into it, that though your late distinguished Uncle was
unquestionably a striking and notable publio figure,—that alone, in
these days, is not enough to warrant us in anticipating a marked
success. To put a plain business-like question in plain business-
like language,—Are you sure that your materials, valuable and
interesting as they doubtless are, are also sufficiently spicy to tickle
the market?
Spirited Literary Executor [with confidence). There is not a repu-
tation in London, my dear Sir, that is not more or less smirched—
badly smirohed; while several—believe me, I am not putting it too
strongly—are fairly blasted out of Court. It will be one of the
most taking and widely-read biographical high-olass memoirs ever
put out.
Enterprising Publisher. Well, you give an encouraging account
of it, certainly; and, if it's all you say, it 'a just the sort of thing
I should like to get hold of. Could you give us a specimen now?
How, for instance, does the Pendulum Controversy come out? There
ought to be some rare pickings on that?
Spirited Literary Executor [with enthusiasm). There are! Shall
I read you a page or two? I have the MS. with me. [Produces it.
Enterprising Publisher (much interested). Do. I am all attention.
[And is, while Spirited Literary Executor gives several racy
extracts from a journal which, after detailing how a well-
known Cabinet Minister, now living, was met on one occasion
being carried on a stretcher by four policemen to Bow Street,
relates the manner in which a very exalted foreign Per-
sonage was found picking pockets in the hat-ana-cloak-
room at a memorable Admiralty Reception.
Spirited Literary Executor (continuing and finishing a neat and
naive narrative, compromising the honour of several illustrious and
noble families). "And, with the Aquarium ticket in her pocket, the
Duchess was found under his table; and though the Cabinet entirely
condoned the matter, B told me that the Duke would be satisfied
with nothing short of a run down to Windsor with the whole par-
ticulars, and was only pacified, on getting J 's place and £1500
hu«h-money. from X into the bargain."
Enterprising Publisher (with enthusiasm). Capital! Just the
style! Pointed, pithy, and pungent." But you '11 do better to drop
initials. They 're weak. (Warming.) Stick in names, my boy.
The Publio like *em. So do I.
Spirited Literary Executor. Quite so: and you shall have them.
A propos, when this is placed,—I've got something better to follow!
Something much better.
Enterprising Publisher (quite carried away). Gad, Sir! bring it
to me when this is floated, and whatever it is, hang me! if we won't
have it out, and, if need be, faoe a thundering good aotion for libel,
and get heavily cast together!
[But, fortunately for the dignity of letters, and the sacredness
of private social life, to the satisfaction of all right-minded
people, they wait a bit first—and think it over.

A TRAITOR.
Fare {noticing the decoration). "Oh! so you belong to the Blue Ribbon
Army I"
Cabby. "Yes, Sib, I wear tub Ribbon. It inuooces Gen'lbmen to temp'
mi with A Drink, which I generally accep's, Sir!"
THE MODERN KING PEST.
"I had a dream which was not all a dream."
How I pot there I cannot precisely tell. But it was a singular scene, and
strange was the companionship into which I had fallen; fallen unawares, and,
as yet, it appeared unheard and unnoticed.
A convivial gathering it seemed. Convivial! So is Holbein's grim mas-
querade of Mors called a Dance. Yet merry enough the oddly assorted convives
appeared, merry with sardonic mirth and metallic cachinnation. They sat, or
rather sprawled, around what seemed a trestled-board. The place reeked with
a miasmatic mist, through which their grotesque forms gleamed fitfully,
shiftingly, indefinably. And what was that odour, that sense-searching and
stomach-stirring odour, so peculiar and yet so indescribable? Why was it
vaguely associated in my mind with mire-clogged streets and many baskets,
with sudden whiffs over shabby hedges in inchoate suburbs, with staggering
notice-boards, and shouting cart-tenders, with six in the morning in City
squares, with new bricks and cracked stucco, with a mysterious mixture of
crude spick-and-spanness and incipient decay P Why f
"Civilisation!" cried one of the guests, catching up the last word of his
neighbour's speech, "Ha! ha! ha 1 Civilisation is your only joke! 'Tis a
dull world, but he who can mouth that word without laughter, might defy
Momus' self to move his leathern midriff."
The laugh of this gentleman was like the "ducking" of a half-dry pump-
sucker. His face was hard, saffron-hued, and of a singular metallic sheen, as
of an embodiment of jaundice cast in bronze. Whether he looked more cruel
or more comic it were hard to say. A personage with the facial hardness of an
antique knocker, and the set grin of a mediaeval gargoyle is likely to wear an
I expression too equivocal for summary analysis.
'Ah, Mam., old man," hissed his vis-d-vis, in acuriously stealthy and snaky
tone which made me creep. "Civilisation is a blundering general, a sort of
sham Csesar, thrasonic enough in all conscience, who'd fight a locust-swarm
with Armstrongs. Fancy planting a battery of field-guns against a phalanx
of ghosts! Fancy barring mere solidities like doors and windows against me!
He! he! he!"
The laugh of this creature was like the jerky hissing
of steam from an escape-valve. I preferred that of the
previous speaker. Faoially he was as phantasmal as the
other was stolid,—grey, agape, aghast, with shadowy
hands which writhed hither and thither like the arms of
an octopus, but soundlessly and as it seemed aimlessly.
"Typhy, Typhy," creaked his next-door neighbour,
harshly, you are getting an intolerable egotist.
You've been so much talked about by our loquacious
minatory modern Augurs, that you begin to think you
are everybody and everywhere. Where and what would
you be without our honoured President?"
Here, as with one accord, they all turned toward a
figure at the head of the board, with a sort of co-operative
chuckle of inarticulate gratulation, and, lifting high their
goblets, clinked, and drank in his honour and to his
health. Though I noticed that at the word "health"
a singular spasm, whether of mockery or of pain I could
not tell, seemed to writhe their vaporous forms and
wrinkle their weird faces.
This figure was cloaked and masked like a transpontine
villain, so that I could not distinguish his features.
Portly he was, that his garments could not disguise;
complacent too, that his attitude abundantly indicated.
A huge diamond ring flamed on his fat hand. Like the
odour, that ring and that hand seemed strangely familiar
to me. And, when he spokej that oily, throaty, thra-
sonic voice awoke strangely mingled memories of swag-
gering wealth and creeping squalor, of wind-shaken
chimneys and rain-pierced roofs, of sweating walls and
sodden pathways, of swampy exhalations and of sepul-
chral smells. Why P
"Gentlemen all, I thank you," said he, nodding right
and left, with what seemed a specially marked salutation
to the saffron-faced gentleman at his right hand. "In
fact, I don't know what you would do without me. My
good friend Mam. and I are a sort of conjoint special
providence for you, Typhy, for you, Rheumy,—don't
quarrel, you are both excellent fellows, I'm sure,—and
for all you other honourable members of the great Pest
family. Bless you, but for me and a friend or two of
mine, you might have been improved off the face of the
civilised earth ere now."
"Hear! Hear! Hear!" chuckled, croaked, creaked,
hissed, gasped, gurgled, groaned and gibbered the ghastly
guests in ghostly chorus.
"Thanks once more," continued the Masked One.
"And now, as we are all thoroughly primed for it, I '11
call upon Mam. for a song."
Nothing loth, the Saffron-visaged One arose, and, in
a voice as metallic as the chinking of coins in a miser's
wallet, quavered forth the following ditty:—
"Oho 1 and oho I for a good ' Free Shoot,'
The home of disease's germs!
The deadly composts that force to fruit
The Tree of Death. To our League rich ' loot;'
Fair food for our friends the worms!
Oho! for the damp and the broken drain,
The floors that are laid on slush;
The rotten roof that lets in the rain.
The untrapped pipe and the muck-choked main;
The gaseB that reek and rush!
And hurrah! for the man who the forces of Health
Can baffle, break, bewilder;
For the friend of Disease and of plague-spreading stealth,
Our Chief, the"
But here I could not refrain from a cry of horror. It
was echoed by a louder one from the gathering of ghostly
guests; and with a sort of strange soft shock, as of cloud-
masses crashing together, the whole grim pageantry dis-
appeared, and I found myself in a damp, dirty suburban
waste, gazing across a low level swamp of "Land te be
Let for Building Purposes " into an evil-smelling hollow,
hard by which stood a staggering board bearing the
familiar legend :—" Rubbish may be shot here."
"Hillo, old fellow, how are you P" sounded a voioe in
my ear.
Horror! It was the voice—the same fat, complacent
voice; and its owner, the paunchy, pompous, long-pursed
personage with the swaggering air, the diamond ring, and
the rakish hat, was none other than my old acquaintance,

THE CHILDREN'S FANCY COTTON-DRESS BALL
AT THE MANSION HOUSE.
Well, 1 thinks that upon the hole I have seen perhaps more mag-
nifflsent sites, and more egstrownery sites, than most people, be they
Princes or Dooks or even Aldermen, cos why? Why beoos the
lookers on sees more of the site, as the other lookers on sees more of
the game, than the swells in the one case or the players in the other.
But on Fursday last I suttenly seed the sweetest and the prettyest
and the most intrestingest site as ever I seed since I fust opened my
eyes. The Lord Mare and the Lady Maress, bless their kind
loving arts t giving up for wunce, without a sy or a tear, the com-
pany of the hiest and the mityest of the land, asked about a thousand
of the lovelyest children as ever was borne to dress themselves up in
the most butiful and tastyfulest elos as money or good taste could
buy or could borrow, and to come and dance at the Manshun House
before them and their elustreous friends 1
Ah! that was a site! Why I was in that wirl of egsitement that
I ardly knowed what I was about at fust, and acshally kept a
helping myself to claret cup and common things of that sort and
drinkin good elths with the dear Children. There was one brite
little Chap in partiokler who was dressed like a Baker, all in white
with cherry ribbons, like a Baker I spoBe on his birth-day or his
weddin-day, who made quite trends with me, and acshally asked me
what they calls 1 think a Commun-drnm! A Oent had drunk
some wine out of a glass and then left it, so the little chap says
to me, says he, "Why ought that glass of wine to be ashamed of
itself Y Give it up?" "Yes." "Coz it's half drunk," says he,
and away he runs.
Well, I larfed to that extent that I spilt three or four glasses of
Negus afore I could get my and steddy.
Then there was two lovely littledeersdrest just likefairys with wands
in their little ands, and I really shouldn't nave been at all surprized
if they conjured us all into meer angels or animals or sumthing of
that dredful sort, they did look so real like. Then there was prin-
cesses and shepherdesses with their crooks, and little Red Biding
Hoods, and Bobbing Hoods and Archers, I means Jockeys, and
Agiptians with their pretty little faces half covered up with muz-
zling, and then there was some nice little girls a imitatin their elders
by dressing theirselves np like the other sects, and there was some
werry short Highlanders, and all kinds of Forreners and other
strange people.
But lor how kind it was of the Lord Mare to ask about a duzzen
of the werry poorest children to come and mix with the rest, just for
wunce in their poor lives, such as a poor little fishing-boy, and a
butcher-boy with his tray, and a poor little labourer in a smock
frock, and one or two common sailor boys and pilot's boys in sow-
westers and' grate sea-boots, and really after a little while they
seemed just as much at home as the rest. Ah, what stories these
poor little chaps will have to tell when they go back to their poor
umble homes!
In the midst of all the fun who should wark in, quite carm and
cool, but Mr. Chasg, the Chinese Giant and his little midge of a son.
Well, they two contrasts caused such a excitement that all us
Waiters oouldn't wait no longer, but rushed out with one accordeon
into the Lobby and had as good, a look as the rest.
Soon after this, all the little deers was ordered to set down on the
floor all round in a oercle to hear the sillybrated Conjuror a talking
in several places at once and a teaching his little boy " How dutn
the little bizzy B," and they made about the biggest as well as the
loveliest Bookay as ever I seed. And, bless their dear little arts,
how they did larf—aye, and so did sum of the big ones too, when
they thort as nobody wasn't a looking.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARTVARJ.

I HOPE I DON'T INTRUDE!
Why, even the Lobd Maee larfed to that extent at Mr. Punch,
that the tears a most run down his rite honnerable cheeks. Ah,
that's one of the wunders of the world, that is; igh and low, rich
and poor, learned like ourselves, or hignorant like the lower orders,
all enjoys their Punch, tho I must say as his morality is that ques-
tionable that I should not hold his Mirror up to Nature for my own
family cerole.
There was one thing as was forgotten to be purwided amid all the
other luxuries and dellyeasies of a waried Menu. There was no
Ginger Beer, and I had to enounce the sad fact to a Page of the time
of Billybbeious, I think he was, to a Marqueeze of the time of
Loukt Cattobze and to two Normandy Pheasants, and grately dis-
appointed they all seemed, specially the Page.

think about 13 years old, found fault with the Shampagne and

Skottish, danced to the tune of "The Camels are coming," the same
tune I spose as they played in Egyp.
And my final remark at the close is, strange to say, in regard to
the olose, for 1 never should have thort it posbibel, if 1 hadn't seen
it with my own too eyes, that Buch butiful dresses as was worn then
could all have been made out of Cotton, no, not if Alderman Cotton,

A PAIR OF SPECTACLES AND DIFFERENT SIGHTS.
Recipe, or, in this instanoe, Alf.-
TnoMPSoif-and-'alf-RoBKET-RKECE-ipe,
for making a "Grand Spectaoular Ex-
travaganza " :—Take a familiar Fairy
Legend. Cat off its head, dock its
tail, and carefully, dislocate, all its
articulations, till its story is as incohe-
rent as Koote's and as null as the Needy
Knifegrinder's. Distribute its disjecta
membra over four mortal: hours of
jumbled speotaole, ballet, nigger non-
sense, step-dancing, circus trioks, sen-
sational effects, and acrobatic evolutions.
Mix and season throughout with Musio-
Hall spioe of the strongest savour.
Serve up hastily and half-
oooked in crude indigestible
gobbets.
The above we deduced from
witnessing the first night's
representation of The Yellow

*n3r"W^s^ J ^8 ^° 'illperl Kokottina, she
was all the Great Vance
Great Attraction for the Holidays!! painted her, and must have
been a Vision of Delight,
indeed, to innocent children and their careful Mammas.
None but himself could be his parallel,—unless one can conceive a
Cockney Caliban playing the part of a Whitechapel Fenthesilea.
"Why was I born so beautiful.'
And why was I born so young P"
queries the Inimitable. Why, indeed? Or with such a modest
front ? or with such a mellifluous voice ? or with such piquantly pea-
cocky jerkiness of song, or with such ravishing facility of gesture
and wink? Or, for the matter of that, why at all— save, perhaps, to
accentuate the victory of the Music-Hail over the Theatre, and
charm our ladies, and enohant our little ones with the blatancies
and brutalities heretofore unfairly reserved for the enjoyment of
counter-jumpers and shop-girls, of howling cada and callow boys-
about-town r
Yet, in this prodigious, ill-made Burlesque-pudding, there were
plenty of plums, to be extracted by any critical Jack Horner who
could keep his stall and his temper tor four hours at a stretch. The
spectacular part of the business was capital, when it would work,—
which, as a rule, on the first-night, it wouldn't. The Ballet o£Fans
was very pretty. Another dance, the quaint and comical " Dolls'
Quadrille," was
simply delicious. The
Lowther-Arcade-like
get-up of the dolls—
Mile. Rosa and the
three (by no means
sham) Abrahams—
their stiff wooden
poses, their jerky
movements, their
wide vacuous stares,
their mechanical
bounds, and helpless
final flops, when their
works ran down, were
worthy of Alice's own
Wonderland. This
was, indeed, panto-
mimic - fun of the
best, brightest, and
most blameless sort.
The Baby Elephants,
Jenny and Jock, did some wonderful things with barrels and bottles
and Dells, but took rather a long time about it. The "Veil of
Vapour, or Steam Curtain " wouldn't rise for a long time ; and, when
it did, presented the "startling and novel effect" of a locomotive
jerkily blowing off in a drawing-room, with the view, apparently,
of covering—only it didn't—the retreat of a couple of burglars who
were running away with the chimney-piece.
After this the Deluge. Everything stuck or went wrong. "The
Underground Line to the Golden Mines "—a picture of something
between a runaway engine and the City Dragon turned fire-swal-
lower—palled upon the audience after half-an-hour's undisturbed
inspection, and as the orchestra couldn't make up its mind as to how
many tunes it should play at once, the Gallery relieved it of further
responsibility by singing We won't go Home till Morning "—which
indeed we didn't.

Sweetness and Light at Drury Lane.

There is plenty of ill-digested " stuff" and of real cleverness and
prettiness in the piece; and when it works smoothly, is a little less
long, and, it may he added, a little less broad, it may probably go
well enough. But the Countess D'Aulnoy, interpreted by Mr. Alfred
Vance in petticoats, a few clever acrobats
and dancers, and a number of voiceless sticks,
could never be " nice" in any sense, though
it went as smoothly as .-K.nka's aerial flight,
and as pat as Pektoldi's feathery footfall.
We 're afraid Pandora's Box has been opened
too soon.
The second spectacle is Drury Lane, of
which we hear better accounts. The Kings
of England soene is still the attraction.•.■ One
food novelty here is the trick-book of the
antomime with coloured plates. Off one of
these coloured plates the Giant (who was cut
out on the first night) is eating. The fact of
his having .been eliminated proves that the
monster must have been "cut out for a
Giant." The notion of this picture-book, as
well as of the Drury Lane Annual—a highly-
coloured Christmas Number of nothing—is
due, we believe, to the energetic Mr. Augustus
Moore—Augustus the Second at this.estab-
lishment, where the other Augustus (Mr.
Ha kkis) is the C»sar—who, a year ago,
undertook the duties of Acting Manager, in
which was included the post of Literary Adviser, originally held, in
the Chattertonian days, by Charles Lamb Kenny. The Sub-
Augustus is Drury Lane Prime Minister and Chancellor of the
Exchequer, and represents the Grand Young Man.
By the way. d propot of Chabxes Lamb Kenny, a performance
will be given ty Mr. J. L. Toole, Mr. Henry Neville, and others,
on the 25th inst., for the benefit of Mrs. Kenny, when her daughter
Rosa will, we believe, appear as Maria in the School for Scandal.
Charles Kenny helped to confer many benefits upon others in
his time, and very few on himself. He was always to everybody
"Charles—his friend," but never "Charles his own friend,"
and continual ill-health necessitated a falling-ofi in work and in
pay. We are all sorry to hear that a Benefit is necessary, but we
are all glad to give a helping hand. Would that Kenny's old friend.
Arthur Skbtchlby, were still with us to play Fahtaff! Alas 1
"we could have better spared a better man! "—out there were very
few better or truer than the inventor of the oelebratcd Mrs. Brown

over, I sternly pass on to the painful
t of what I shall designate "Peouliar
REPORTS OF OUR OWN CITY COMMISSIONER.
No. III.—Livery Companies.
Mb. Punch, Sir,
I hats kept to the last certainly the most important
Reform that I hare to recommend, and in this case at any rate reso-
lutely shutting my mind's-eye to the glorious scenes I have witnessed
in their more than Trinoely Halls, and steadfastly
refusing to remember the sumptuous repasts of
which I have of late so freely partaken, and
passing with a deep sigh of regret from the
pleasant recollection of suoh brands and special
cuvees of exquisite wines as memory would fain
linger i
subject
Trusts."
I refer'to the notes of my examination of the
Master before mentioned, and what do I find? A
small estate was left to his Company some three
hundred years ago, in trust, the income from
which, then about £20 a year, was ordered to be
distributed as follows:—£5 each to three different Charities, and the
remainder to the Company for their trouble. Years roll on, and
the little Estate now produces about £2,000 per annum, and the
Company continue to pay the same original amount of £15 to the
three Charities, and keep the rest, that is, about £1,985, for them-
selves; all, as the Master said, in strict accordance with the literal
words of the Will of the Pious Founder!
Mr. Punch, Sir. No recollections of unnumbered kindnesses
received from Masters and Wardens, no thought of what I risk in
giving utterance to my honest feelings, no cowardly fear of per-
petual banishment from their Halls of dazzling light, shall prevent
me from expressing, in language as unmeasured as the hospitality of
which I have so often partaken, and the philanthropy of which I
have so often heard, the poignant regret I feel that anyone of these
noble Institutions should so far forget the solemn obligations imposed
upon all Trustees, particularly upon Trustees for the Poor and the
Sick and the Ignorant, as to act in the way described, and then con-
descend to defend such conduct by such flimsy and discreditable
arguments.
I And, on referring to my Notes, that when the Master of the
Bellows Menders' Company attempted to justify what had been done,
by a reference to the Will of the Pious Founder, that, acting on that
natural impulse that Alls a generous spirit at any miserable attempt
to impose upon his common sense, I exclaimed, Pious Fiddlestick f"
a strange combination you will say. Sir, that nothing but towering
indignation could justify, and which, upon oalm reflection, might be
substituted by " Mellifluous Cant."
However that may be, in this case at any rate I can have no hesi-
tation in recommending instant compliance with the evident inten-
tions of the generous Testator, and a restitution of the unhallowed
spoil of the last six years.
But, Sir, after holding up this and similar cases (few, I believe, in
number) to your wrathful indignation, there my anger ceases, and I
can allow my thoughts again to revert calmly and philosophically to
those two great attributes by which these Institutions have been so
nobly distinguished during the last half-century, and which may
fairly be designated as the Guild Virtues of Philanthropy and Hospi-
tality: and, in the genial spirit therein engendered, I conclude my
difficult task by enumerating the Reforms that my stern sense of
duty, uninfluenced, I trust, by thankfulness for the past or by
gratitude for favours to come, compels me to submit to your wise
consideration:—
Fust—The Members of the Courts of the various Guilds must be
more intimately connected with the Trades they were originally
founded to govern, and must dedicate themselves earnestly to the
re-establishing of the good old English prinoiple that a Manufac-
turer's word is his bond. They must become the terror of evil-doers,
and we should not then have reels of silk falsely marked as contain-
ing 50 yards, really containing only 25, or other "little articles"
warranted to measure 100 yards, actually measuring from 20 to 30
per cent, less, according to the Market for which they are intended,
and there would then also be such an entire abolition of Devil's Dust
as would restore the old oharaoter to English Cottons, even to the
farthest confines of China or Peru.
Secondly—Sham Apprenticeships must be exchanged for real
Travelling Scholarships, for the acquirement of technical knowledge
in manufacture and design. The first three voluntary Missionaries
in this delicate and difficult task I have already indicated.
_ Thirdly—The powers of the Livery must be extended to the elec-
tion of the Court, the auditing of the accounts, and the ordering of
the dinners, so that the knowledge of this important art and mystery
may be preserved intact.
Fourth and lastly—All Trusts, whether peculiar or otherwise,
must be rigorously carried out in accordance with the will of the
testator, but modified in accordance with the requirements of justice
and common sense. While therefore, in the case above alluded to,
justice would require a new scheme of distribution, in the case of the
£20,000 left to the Jolly Butchers "to enjoy themselves," common
sense would naturally say, continue so to do.
These necessary reforms being accomplished, there will be nothing
left that the ribald jester, or that terrible nuisance, the logical
reformer, can reasonably complain of; and from a careful and
liberal calculation I have made. I find, to my extreme satisfaction,
that these various matters can all be thoroughly accomplished out of
the wasted portion of the enormous sum now expended on Manage-
ment, namely £297,218 6«. «</., leaving intact the noble sum of
£337,801 Lis. id. to be still dedicated to that grandest of all Civic
virtues-Hospitality. Youb Own Cot Commissionee.
Temple, December, 1882.
HOW TO AMUSE THE CHILDREN.
No doubt, encouraged by " the great suooess " which has attended
the production of the "seasonable Christmas pieoes " this year at the
leading London Theatres, the following scenario of "an annual for
1883-4 " has already been prepared by a "practised hand," and for-
warded to the proper quarters.
TrrLsv-vi/i Baba, or QuUiver, or Blue Beard. This is really
immaterial, as the story is of the slightest materials, and can be
easily adapted to suit the exigencies of the Scene-painter, the Ballet-
master, and the Stage-manager. But say Blue-Beard, as it looks
well in the bills, and has not Deen done for a long time.
Scene 1.—Front grooves. Demon house of the Giant Advertiierus.
Good opportunity for introducing cases of champagne, boxes of
cough-lozenges, and tailors' vans. Serio-comic Lady with the song,
"There isn't much to look at whin I've got 'em on!
Scene 2.—Glade in the Realms of Eternal Rose-buds. Tinsel and
colour laid on by " the talented assistants " of anybody. Dance of
the Brougham Brigade with seal-skin jaokete. Final tableau of
bouquets left at the stage-door, and real gold and jewelled bracelets.
Scene 3.—Blue Beard's kitchen. Introduction of characters of
the story. Blue Beard, by Dolly Tinkler of the Marquee Musio-
Hall, the Young Nabob, by the Great Wheeze, The Squire, by the
Great Hullabaloo, the Performing Donkey, by Tommy Tumbler,
Junr., &o. Songs introduced—" So did you!" "I've been up to my
Larks ever Since!" "The County-Court Family," " Oh, Mummy,
dear, my Father's run »n," and twenty-seven breakdowns.
Scene 4.—Anywhere. Topical songs by the Great Ones. Tommy
Tumbler, Junr. climbs up the chandelier, and makes faces at the
children. The Young Nabob has never heard of Stationers' Hall—
Blue Beard conveys him thither.
Scene 5.—Exterior of Stationers' Hall where Shaesfbare's Plays,
had they been written nowadays, would have been registered.
Distant view of St. Paul'B Cathedral. Grand procession or all the
characters in the Swan of Avon's masterpieces. Correct costumes.
An inoident thrown in here and there. Eight hundred supers
employed. Magnificent appointments. Most instructive to the little
ones. The whole concluding with a grand review of all the London
and Provincial Box-keepers (represented by children) under the
command of the Lessee, who will announce the amount of the
receipts of the Theatre per night, give some notion of the items in
his butcher's book, and afford other interesting details of domestio
expenditure to satisfy the curiosity of a sympathising Public This
should be the scene of the whole snow.
Scenes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.—The place is immaterial. The
selection can be safely left to the Scene-painters. However, it might
help the story a little to work in a Panorama of the Overland Route
to India; but this is not absolutely necessary. Interlude of per-
forming camels, lasting two hours and a half. More oomio songs
for the Great Ones, "Have you seen my reach-me-downs so golop-
shous and gummy t" "This is the Way to the Gaiety Bar! and
atriotic ditty, "'Ere's 'Ooray for 'er Majesty the
the great pal
Quine!"
Scene 12.—Transformation. Interlude of the New Year bringing
in Disease, Death, and Bankruptcy (this to please and instruct the
little ones), clearing off to show the Bright Birthplace of the Electrio
Light (opportunity for good-paying Advertisement), with Ladies of
the Ballet, in Anti-Lord-Chamberlain costumes, lolling about in all
directions. Red, blue, and green fire, closed in Dy
Short Comic Scene, consisting of seven-eighths Bounding Brothers
of Bohemia to one-eighth Christinas Clown.
N.B.—The Pantomime of which the above is a scenario, will be
held together by about fifty lines of doggerel, which, however, need
not be used unless desired.
Mrs. Ramsbotham tells us she has just been to see her Uncle's
new house. She says the hall, which is beautifully painted in
Fiasco, has a most composing effect.

GAMBETTA AND CHANZY—STATESMAN
AND SOLDIER.
Too Soon! 80 pride will plead, so love will say,
When towering crests stoop midmoBt of the fray,
When great swords shiver ere the close of day.
Too Soon! Scarce breathed in an unfinished fight,
Dead wielders of an unexhausted might.
Who at full noontide find unbidden night.
Trees'smitten'in'full leaf by Btorm's red beam, ■">
Flood-breasting swimmers sunken in mid-stream,
Stars quenched before their time. 'Tis so we dream,.
How.may we know, or with what^measure mark
The perfect compass of the soul's frail bark
That fleets o'er life's bright gleam from.dark to dark P
Yet fallen'strength and frustrate purpose"move
Regret; 'tis scarce for mortals to reprove
Mortal misjudgment bom of pride and Jove.
Gambetta—Chanzy! The Republic's yoke
Of sudden grief must sympathy provoke.
The Brain, the Sword, both snatched as at one stroke!
What labour yet, what benison or bane
For France lay hidden in that strenuous brain,
Now still, for ever hidden must remain.
Had his wild strength crested its highest wave?
Would it have worked to shatter or to Bave?
There comes no answer from Gahbetta's grave.
He had the power to stir a nation's heart,
In hopeless strife to play a Titan part,
And he died young, leaving no olear-lined chart
To guide his Country on her doubtful wav
O'er a dark course, whence one keen lurid ray
Dies out with him. AVhat further may one say?
At least in grief the France he loved may sit,
Folding her lowered Flag, as is most fit.
Across nis breast who ne er despaired of it.
At least a sister nation soft may tread
In silent sympathy, with grief-bowed head,
Where a great People mourn its great Sons dead.
HYSTERICAL RELIGION.
This new, and'not altogether healthy, mania of the day, appears
to be starting badly with the new year. The " Converted Clown,"
who was known by the somewhat effeminate name of Eugenie, and
who left the depths of Blue Ruin to scale the heights of Blue
Ribbonism, has fallen once more irretrievably. He has misappro-
priated money, which ought never to have beeu entrusted to him,
has been found helplessly drunk when his presence was wanted at a
charitable meeting, and has attempted suicide.
General Booth has been sued for Parochial Rates for the Converted
Grecian Theatre. "Things isn't as they used to was " in the good old
days of the Conquest. But those were historical, not hysterical
times.|
One of Ibving'8 Tales.—When Mr. Phelps, the Tragedian, was
very thirsty, so Mr. Irving recently informed a Temperance Sooiety,
he used to bite his tongue. Mr. Irving got this anecdote, he says,
from Mr. Phelps himself, who certainly was one of the driest Actors
ever seen: and we suspect that the " good old man" must have had
his tongue in his cheek when he said he bit it.

[From Two Points of View.)
FIRST POINT OF VIEW.—HOW IT IS EXPECTED TO "WORK.
Scene—Angelina's Boudoir. Edwin and his Wife discovered.
Edwin. And so, love, you quite understand the new
measure?
Angelina. Entirely, darling. But you may as well
run over the chief provisions.
Edwin. You have a perfect right to deal with all
your real and personal property.
Angelina. As if I were a. feme sole—which, in effect,
I am r
Edwin. Quite so. You take the rents and profits
of all real property, and dispose of personalty ab-
solutely.
Angelina. And I think, dear, that it is unnecessary to
get your consent to any of my investments? That I can
keep a separate banking-account, and so forth?
Edwin. Exactly. In the eyes of the law we are two persons.
Angelina. So 1 imagined. And I rather fancy, darling, that any
moneys you receive from me you must account for? Am I not right,
sweetest?
Edwin. Unquestionably.
Angelina. Correct me if I am wrong—but, my own, I always have
my remedy at Civil Law?
Edwin. Certainly.
Angelina. Even when we are sharing the same dear home I can
conduct a suit against you?
Edwin. Yes, darling—but you would not?
Angelina. Well, love, business is business. And, d propos, what
did you do with the five pounds I gave you (and which came to me
as next of kin to my uncle) to convey to my dressmaker?
Edwin [confused). Well, dear, as my tailor was rather pressing,
I thought you would not mind my paying him before
Angelina (severely). What! You nave misappropriated my money?
Edwin [nervously). I do not like this tone, Angelina! And, to
mark my displeasure, I shall go to Brighton by myself for a fort-
night.
Angelina. A step I was about to suggest, Edwin, as you know
I cannot take criminal proceedings against you while we are living
together I [Exit Edwin, tremblingly, to consult his Solicitor.
SECOND POINT OF VIEW.—HOW IT IS SURE TO WORK.
Scene—Edwin's Study. Angelina and her Husband discovered.

we like.
Edwin. Yes, darling. It's all right. Now we can do anything
Angelina. Oh, how delightful I And no more stupid restrictions.
I shan't be obliged to go before a musty old Judge when you want
to get rid of any of our money?
Edwin. Oh, dear, no, angel. That sort of thing is quite out of
date. The law regards us, in later days, as two distinct persons.
You can do just what you like with your own money.
Angelina. That is just what you like, darling, for my money is
yours. Oh, I am so pleased I And you will promise never to bother
me any more about business? You will do just what you want
with all the rents and profits and things?
Edwin (laughing). Well, it's rather a heavy responsibility. You
know the law gives you a remedy. Wives can proceed against their
husbands.
Angelina (ironically). Oh, can they P
Edwin. Yes; not only in civil suits, but even in criminal actions.
Angelina (indignantly). The Law allow a wife to send her husband
to prison! The Law should be ashamed of itself!
Edwin. But, then, husbands in liko manner can incarcerate their
wives!
Angelina [agitated). But you wouldn't, dear! You wouldn't be
so cruel I
Edwin. Well, business is business! There—don't cry. I was
only joking. And that reminds me that the remaining thousand,
which you took as next-of-kin to your Aunt, had better be invested.
I think I shall put it into Turkish Sixties.
Angelina (nervously). But haven't you lost rather a lot, dear,
before, by putting things into Turkish Sixties?
Edwin (angrily). I do not like this tone, Angelina! What I you
interfere with my disposition of your money I
Angelina (piteously). Oh, no, darling!
Edwin (severely). Well, I shall mark my displeasure by going to
Paris by myself for a month!
Angelina (crying). Oh, Edwin! (Wiping her eyes.) Well,
perhaps it will do you good, darling—it will do you good! And
I would suffer anything for your sake I But, to show you are not
angry with me, do, do— (sobs)—put the money into Turk—(sob)—

THE GOOD FAIRY COMPE-
TITION.
What the City Corporation
resolutely refused to do with re-
gard to Billingsgate Market, and
the Duke of Mudford showed
few signs of doing with regard to
Covent Garden (or Mud-Salad)
Market, is being done without
their aid, and probably in spite
of their counter-influence, by the
Good Fairy Competition. The
new river-side Fish Market at
Wanning has opened the eyes of
the Corporation to the weakness
of their position as Lords of the
Kingdom of Muck; and the Par-
liamentary Notices of a new great
General Market at Paddington,
and another at South Kensington,
have possibly had something to
do with the Duke of Mtjdford's
offer of Covent Garden and
neighbourhood to the Metropoli-
tan Board of Works. South Ken-
sington threatening to mix Art
with Artichokes, and Horticul-
ture with Summer Cabbages,
must be as great a blow to the
Kmperor of Turnip-Tops as Fat
Henry's ingratitude was to Car-
dinal Wolset.
News from the East.—On the
tapis. The Holy Carpet has gone
to be mended. Apropos of this, a
gentleman, who has been recently
furnishing his rooms in Picca-
dilly, told his upholsterer that he
wanted his floor to be "wholly
carpet." The rather staggered
but obliging upholsterer sent at
once to Egypt, but being unable
to procure the article in question,
he persuaded his customer to use
Turkish rugs and matting.

their lives to the study of Art, working at it from sixteen to sixty,
be expected to speak without prejudice and evident bias on the one
subject to which they have given their undivided attention and the

"Very fine." Get into the wine-cellar
to avoid the effects of the hurricane.
"Warm and dry." Don't venture half
a dozen yards from home without an
Ulster ana a sou'-wester.
"Cold." Summer clothing may be
assumed with impunity.
Very rough and windy." Good time for smoking al fresco,
or playing lawn-tennis, as not a breath of air need be expected.
"Hurricane." Safe of a calm passage across the Channel.
"Prolonged wet and boisterous weather." The best season for a
nice trip into the country, as blue sky and gentle zephyrs may be
confidently expected.

Sib,—I have just read the letter of your Correspondent, One who was
Present, in your to-day's paper,i; indignantly repudiating the statement pub-
lished in the life of the late Vice-Chancellor Stingo, to the effect that in the
Cabinet Council held on the afternoon of the memorable 9th of June, 1843,
it was he who, after throwing a couple of inkstands at the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, was finally removed from the room by the ushers threatening
them with an office poker. As he somewhat unnecessarily mentions my name
in connection with the affair, I cannot but think a most erroneous impression
is likely to be created about a very ordinary matter. How the Vice-Chancellor
got hold of the story, I cannot conjecture; but for the information of those who
are not behind the scenes in these affairs, I may inform your readers that 1
have no distinct recollection of more than one inkstand on the occasion referred
to; though there was a disagreeable incident in connection with a certain
Colonial Secretary's head and the waste-paper basket that your correspondent
seems strangely to have forgotten. More I am not at liberty to say, beyond
that I am Your obedient servant
ToLKTNGTON.
Sib,—An anonymous friend has sent me an extract from the Diary of the late
Vice-Chancellor Stinoo, in which the amazing statement is made that it was I
who pushed the Duchess down the stairs at the Oower Street Station, and
refused to give my name to the tioket-collector at the bottom, when the crowd
knocked my hat over my eyes and nearly strangled me with my own collar.
As everybody in Society knows that the story refers to the conduct of a distin-
guished General Officer who had been spending an evening at the King's Cross
Theatre, I think it is nothing short of an outrage to dig it up at this date, and
fasten it on to me. For the rest, I have never worn a shirt-collar in my life.—
Yours, &c, The Retired Colonial Bishop in Question.
Sib,—I have just read in your issue of yesterday an extraot from the Diary
of the late Vice-Chancellor Stingo, purporting to be the subject of an after-
dinner conversation held with me on the Margate Extension Pier some time in
the autumn of 1867.
Vice-Chancellor Stingo, in collecting and plaoing on record the ill-natured
and injudicious gossip current at the popular sea-side resort at a time when
local feeling was excited by rumours that the Under Secretary of State, on being
charged with pledging the oruet-Btand, had refused to
pay nis hotel bill, and had been foroibly removed on
several occasions from the Assembly Rooms by the
Master of the Ceremonies, in consequence of his violent
and persistent insobriety, has omitted, to my great
regret, to note also what my own views and comments
on these reports were, thereby creating an incomplete
and painful impression. It is within the bounds of possi-
bility that, under the influenoe of a generous glass of
wine or two, and the exhilarating stimulus of the sea-
air, I may have—a little indiscreetly, I admit—but in
the very strictest confidence, imparted to the Vice-Chan-
cellor, who always relished a bit of scandal, an item or
two of the "outrageous gossip " of the hour. But I am
almost sure I must have added at the time that / didn't
believe a single word of it. Under these circumstances
it is not only extremely surprising, but annoying to me
to find that what I may call the harmless bonhomie in
which I [indulged on the occasion in question, should
have been'put prominently into type without my know-
ledge or permission, ana have caused much heart-
burning in certain quarters. I may further add that I
entertain the deepest respect and admiration for the
eminent Statesman referred to, a respect and admiration
that I am all the more anxious to express, as I find that,
by some unfortunate mischance, I shall have to face him
at dinner at the house of a mutual friend, on Tuesday
next. Trusting, therefore, that you will do me the favour
of inserting this retractation in your columns at the very
earliest opportunity,
I am, Sir, your obedient servant, Anthill.
Sib,—I have read with some regret and not a little
astonishment r a letter from the late Vice-Chancellor
Stinoo to Sir Drumhond Finchley, in which the fol-
lowing passage occurs:—"I then talked to X. He is
an idiotic, vulgar, low-bred, illiterate, ill-natured scoun-
drel, whom I would not trust alone in a room for half- a-
minute with a five-pound note." On this, I need
scarcely say, I offer no oomment,
I am, Sir, your obedient servant, X.
Sib,—I have not yet come across a copy of the late
Vice-Chancellor Stingo's Diary, recently given to the
world, "after careful supervision," by his uncle, who
has acted as his literary executor. As, however, I was
for thirty-nine years the intimate friend and boon com-
panion of the distinguished Jurist, who so long made a
notable figure in the brilliant society of our times, and
was always telling him good stories, I am, I need scarcely
say, fully prepared for the worst. Meantime, I have
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
A Veby Old Friend.
Sib,—The statement so recklessly put forward in the
Vice - Chancellor's Memoirs to the effect that a late
President of the Royal Academy never sat down
to a game of whist without a couple of aces up each
of his coat-sleeves, strikes me as singularly uncharitable,
and requiring some explanation. I write with all the
more feeling on this point, as I frequently cut in for a
hand or two against him, and, as far as I can remember,
invariably won. Now that he is no longer here to defend
himself, it seems to me singularly ungenerous to tax him
with an amount of clumsiness that, under the circum-
stances, could have been nothing short of phenomenal.
It is but fair to his memory to say I think the good Vice-
Chancellor must have been misinformed. Yours, &c.
W. W.
Sib,—I cannot at all understand how I have given
any sort of offence, by publishing at this most opportune
moment .the carefully edited memoirs of my late nephew,
the Vice-Chancellor. I have, with the greatest patience,
not only purged the book of all references—and they are
numerous—to indictable offences, but suppressed materials
that if properly utilised could not fail to fill every Conrt
of the New Palace of Justice with a libel case for the
next three years to come. Under these circumstances, I
think if you were to see the perfect Newgate Calendar I
still have in store (and which I hope to produce on some
future occasion), you would compliment me rather on my
delicate discretion. I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
J. M. Stingo.

THE GHOSTS' BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION.
Since a certain trial has been ooncluded, everybody has been
afraid to employ Ghosts. Hence a number of talented and merito-
rious gentlemen have been thrown out of employment. Among
ihem may be mentioned the accomplished Ghost who does Mr.
Tonkmdown's portraits, the clever Ghost who does Mr. Qcisbi's
criticisms, the versatile Ghostwho polishes upMr. Twittekly's poems,
the epigrammatic Ghost who wrote all the good things in Mr. Dod-
dimore's new play, the erudite Ghost who looked afttr the grammar
in Mr. Pinchbeck's essays, and the musical Ghost who wrote all
that is tuneful in Mr. Offenbach Ollek's new opera.
The above-named Society is worthy of the warmest support from
all charitable people.
Further particulars may be found in the Ghosts' Gazette.
It is rumoured that, if subscriptions are not forthcoming, a Ghosts'
Strike may be the result. This, it need scarcely be said, would be a
most serious thing for some professors in literature and art.

pardoned for offering a suggestion to the German Premier. Instead
of disturbing the whole resident and non-resident industrial popu-
lation of the Fatherland, and losing the productive labour of half a
million of the best citizens, it might be well to drill an army of
rogues and vagabonds. Germany is said to possess at least two

Solo by the Plumber.
I scaup the joints, I scamp the drains,
I am an artful Plumber;
You'll feel my hand in winter's rains,
You '11 sniff it in the summer.
I dig, I delve, 1 patch, I pry,
And lay the pipes so badly,
That even bland Surveyors sigh,
And tenants chatter madly.
Here the Jerry Builder breaks in with his
Jeremiad:—
I build my floors on rags and bones,
Or lush organic matter;
Or where the grass in swampy zones
Grows greener and grows fatter.
My doors are sure to warp in time,
My slates let in the water;
Take equal parts of dust and slime,
And there you have my mortar.
I build my walls with many a trick
So shrewd as to astound one;
With here and there a rotten brick,
And here and there a sound one.
The Artful Plumber resumes his plaint .—
The sewer-pipe I love to lay
Connecting with the cistern;
And where's the law that dares to say
The tenant should have his turn?
Finale by the pair:—
Why, here's a Judge who would restrain
Our right to scatter fever!
Should this decision stand, 'tis plain
We.can't scamp on for ever!

GAIETY GOSSIP.
Valentine and Orson is drawing crowded houses. The history
of any Gaiety Burlesque-drama—whioh is about as good a name for
this style of entertainment as any other—is curious and unique. On
the first night an audience
assembles whioh for that
occasion only has ousted
the regular Gaiety audience
from every part of the house.
ThiB audience welcomes the
popular favourites, and then
sets itself deliberately to
oritieise the piece with se-
verity, to call out rude
things from the Gallery, to
chaff from the Pit. to laugh
at and not with the Actors
in the Boxes, and to look
glum in the Balcony.
The Critics, as they jostle
one another in the lobby,
say to one another, "Bur-
lesque is dead; and now
we'll go to supper." But
when they sit down to
write their notioes, it sud-
denly strikes them, indi-
vidually, that the last piece
they saw was just like this on its first night, and yet it ran for
nearly a year, and that the piece before this they had looked upon as
hopeless, and it went on and on until the tunes and sayings were in
everybody's mouth, and people were known to go again and again to
see it; and so, in their prooess of pitching-in they pause, and say,
"But they will probably set all this to-rights in a night or two, and
then it will be numbered amongst the great Gaiety successes."
And so it turns out. The "popular favourites " work their hardest,
the Author does something, there is a re-arrangement, more "busi-
ness," any amount of "gags " thrown in, and the regular audiences
having returned, the exceptional first-nighters are heard of no more,
their noisy protests are forgotten, and the piece goes briskly with its
jokes, songs, and dances, and shouts of the heartiest laughter.
If it is not exactly the story of Valentine and Orson intelligibly
told, at least, here is Miss Farren in the brilliant " family plate,"
whioh is evidently Valtntine—"she will be our Valentine —and
here is Mr. Terbt as a savage with a club and followed by a

ticular to do, and we are bound to say in striot justice to all con-

THE MODERN GOTHS.
(An Extract from a Realistic Romance of the Immediate Future.)
"What is Art, Grandpapa P"
The question was put by a little boy to a white-headed old man
who, seated at a high desk, was pausing over the figures of a ledger.
The room was furnished in the style of the Twentieth Century. It
oontained neither pictures nor piano, and was generally colourless.
"' Art,'" eohoed the veteran, why that is a word, Bobbt,
which has been obsolete for twenty years." The child stared at
him. "Look at me, my lad. Am I not as commonplace and unin-
teresting an old fellow as ever you met P"
"Indeed you are," returned the urchin, affectionately.
"And yet at one time I was an Actor, a Musician, and a Painter.
Long, long ago, before I exchanged Art for Cheesemongering!"
"But what«» Art, Grandpapa P" repeated the little one.
The old man closed his ledger, threw off his long white apron, and
took his grandchild upon his knee.
"Vou must know, Bobbt, that once upon a time there were
places called Theatres, and Concert-Rooms, and Picture-Galleries."
"What strange names!"
"Yes," admitted the aged one with a sigh, "they seem strange
enough now, but onoe they were as familiar in our mouths as house-
hold words. Hem !—Shakspearb!"
"Who was Shakspearb P"
The old man shook his head (he had forgotten), and continued :—
"Theatres were places where you went to be amused. Clever people
represented interesting stories—holding up the mirror to nature—
before beautiful piotures and to the sounds of lovely music"
"Piotures! music!" repeated the child, with wondering eyes.
"I will tell you about them presently. And so all the world went
to the Theatres. There was a Mr. Toole, and a Mr. Vpzin, and a
Mr. Irving, and a Mr. David James, and three Ladies who seemed
to me endowed with perpetual youth, called Bancroft, Terry, and
Kendal. Ah! those were happy days!"
"But what have become of the Theatres? We have none now."
"Alas, no! Then the world took up Actors and Actresses, the
'Profession' (as it was called) rubbed shoulders with Dukes and
Duchesses, ana no ball was complete without an Ophelia or a Lady
Teazle in private clothes. Then the world went farther. A New
Class sprung up. _ Almost everybody became an Actor or an Author.
The New Class seized the Stage. Old Ladies took to playing Juliet
to the prompting of their own grandchildren, and Lord Mayors and
Earls wrote the afterparts to all the Christmas Pantomimes."
"And did any one go to see the Juliets and the afterparts P"
"The world would go to see nothing else! So by degrees the real
Aotors and Authors retired, and took to mercantile pursuits, leaving
the Stage to their successors. Then the world grew tired, of the elderly
Juliets and the inane Pantomimes. Something more was wanted, but
could not now be found, so the Theatres were closed, and in due time
forgotten."
But didn't you say something about Concert Rooms? What were
they?
"Places where you went to hear music. But they too were seized
by the New Class. Feeble young men and portly matrons mono-
polised the pianos. Again the world rushed to hear them, and even
composed BongB for them to sing. The Professionals retired in favour
of their weak-voiced successors. The world grew weary of bad
Binging and asked for good. There was then none to be found. So
the Concert Rooms shared the fate of the Theatres."
"And the Picture Galleries?"
"Were also seized by the New Class. The professional Painters,
after making a last stand by supplying all the designs for the
advertisement hoardings, retired into private life. The very last to
yield was a Royal Academioian called, I think, Trade Marks. The
world, as usual, rushed to see the imitations whioh had supplanted
the real, grew weary, sought in vain for better work, and the
Galleries .were closed like the Concert Rooms and the Theatres."
"And who were these people who seized everything P"
".Conceited idlers," returned the veteran, witn honest indignation,
"with more money than brains. They aired their vanity ana
pleaded charity. They debased the publio taste, and drove the
professionals from their own callings."
"And what were all these silly people called P"
"They were called Amateurs," answered the old ex-Professional,
as he turned away from his grandchild, and resumed onoe more his
duties as a Cheesemonger!
"Hb's a most tiresome man," said Mrs. Rausbothah; "he's
always hunting everybody about. He seems to be of Shaxspxarx's
opinion that'All the world's a Stag.'"

Obsequious Tradesman [delighted, and bowing very low). With
pleasure, Madam. (Returns with an assortment of the most expen-
sive jewellery in his establishment.) This bracelet, Madam, is an
exceptionally beautiful object. Observe the blending of colours
produced by the alternate rubies, opals, and brilliants. [Shows it.
Married Lady. What is the price of this? >
Obsequious Tradesman. The price is two hundred and fifty
guineas, Madam.

tended to propitiate his customers should they venture to
deprecate his charges—a not uncommon event.
Married Lady [carelessly). Then I will take the bracelet. Now
show me some rings—sapphires. Mind, I don't want to go above
a hundred guineas.
[At the end of her purchases has managed to lay in about £1000
worth of first-class jewellery, the real cost of which to the
jeweller is probably £700 ai most. Obsequious Tradesman
begins to wonder who she is.
Obsequious Tradesman [towards end of interview). To whom shall
I put it down, Madam?
Married Lady. Oh, put it down to Mrs. Theodore Topsawtek,
827, Park Lane.
Obsequious Tradesman [who thinks he remembers having heard
something about the Topsawteks, but can't exactly recollect what it
is). Then a young man will call with the articles this afternoon,
Madam; ana no doubt Mr. Theodore Topsawtek
Married Lady. Oh, don't trouble Aim.' He has nothing whatever
to do with the business.
Obsequious Tradesman [smiling still more unctuously). Well,
Madam, I suppose—ahem!—we must look to Mr. Topsawtek for—
ahem 1—for payment P
Married Lady [decidedly). Not at all. I pay for my own require-
ments. But perhaps you are not aware that the new Act of Parlia-
ment enables a wife to dispose of her own property without her
husband's knowledge or consent?
Obsequious Tradesman [to"\ whom the most interesting point is
whether or not Mrs. Topsawtek has any property of her own to
dispose of. but who would rather perish than ask the question). Oh, yes,
Madam; but you see that as the goods can hardly be termed neces-
saries, if Mr. Topsawtek should not feel disposed to pay for them,
he is not obliged to do so by the law. [Brings out a copy of the
Law Reports, and 'reads copious extracts from the judgment of the
House of Lords in the case o/Debenham r. Mellon.)
Married Lady [interrupting). Ah! but the law has been quite
altered. [Takes out a small volume, containing the new Married
Woman's Property Act, bound in Russia leather^ and reads)—"A
married woman shall be capable of acquiring, holding, and disposing
by will or otherwise of any property as if she were unmarried. She
may enter into any contracts, and sue and be sued without the par-
ticipation of her husband,"^&c, &o. (Goes on vivaciously.) You
see, Mr. Topsawteb's legal position is this, and it's not a satisfactory
one—for Mr. Topsawtek. He "endowed" me, of course, at our
marriage, "with all his worldly goods": now I have not endowed him
with all my worldly goods, or any of them, and this new law says 1
can do whatever I like with my own property. And I choose to buy
these bracelets and things. Ho you will kindly send them to me
this afternoon, and on delivery I will give you a cheque on my
bankers. Does that satisfy you P
Obsequious Tradesman [overcome with conflicting emotions). Oh—
entirely, Madam. [Hesitating, and trying to be polite.) Possibly,
you would have no objection to our young man, when he calls with
the articles, seeing Mr. Topsawtek, and receiving his assurance,
just as a matter of form
Married Lady [with dignity). Is not my assurance enough?
Besides, you can't possibly see Mr. Topsawtek, as the new law gives

equally misunderstood or misrepresented points of speech and policy,

Dr. Punch. Humph! May I ask what is that book you were
reading when I entered P
Premier. Oh, a very interesting work, kindly sent me by Pro-
fessor Giuliani, and entitled "Dante Sprigato con Dante."
Dr. Punch. Precisely. And a voluminous " Gladstone explained
by Gladstone" would doubtless be of surpassing interest to Mid-
lothian, and the World. A fine subject, by the way, for some of the
"dormant talent" in the Conservative Party, and which, for the
present, you can very well afford to leave to any budding Disraeli or
callow Canning on that side.

ON THE HIG
AUTHORITY.
After the complete collapse of the extremely circumstantial
rumour, so persistently circulated of late, to the effect that Prince
Albert Victor was about to commence his career as an Oxford
undergraduate at Christ Church, under the tutelage of Dean
Liddkll, the following on dits that have been recently floating freely
about Society, are at length being received with a little more
oiution.
It is understood that Sir Stafford Nortecote has derived such
remarkable benefit from his recent Mediterranean cruise, that he will
after the first of April next, take permanent charge of one of, the
largest of the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamers, and run
backwards and forwards between Shanghai and Oravesend, carrying
the mails, until further notice.
It is interesting to note that among the roll of those who have
most recently been entered as students of;the Royal Academy, there
figures conspicuously the name of Baron Huddlestonb.
The Duke of Cambridge will, on the 5th of next month, take up
his residence in the handsome suite of apartments that have been
specially provided for him inside the crater of Vesuvius. As it is
the intention of his Royal Highness to spend the early Spring in
studying professionally the action of dynamite when shovelled in
large quantities down the mouths of active volcanoes, much interest
as to the result of the expedition has been already manifested in
military circles.
Lord Brabourne is about to take up his quarters at the Dramatic
School of Art, with a view to learning dancing and elocution in
the regular curriculum afforded by the Institution. No reason
has been assigned for this step, which has excited a good deal of
lively comment in political circles at a certain prominent West-
It is stated that Lord Wolsf.lf.y has concluded an arrangement
with the proprietors of Madame Tussaud's Exhibition to sit as
motionless as he can in the place of his own effigy, now being dis-
played at Baker Street, until the termination of the Christmas holi-
days. Over-sensitiveness as to certain points about the model that
represents him, and which the noble Lord regards as " a caricature
that does not do him anything like full justice," is said to have led
to his resolve to take the matter, at any sacrifice, into his own hands.
THE ROMANCE OF JOURNALISM.
In the foreign intelligence daily published in the newspapers,
there frequently occurs a sort of paragraph which, mutatis mutandis,
that is to say change of names merely, everybody seems to have read
over and over again. This is one of them:—
"Cardinal M'Cabe has telegraphed that the statement made ' respecting
the despatches said to have passed between me and Cardinal Jacobini, con-
cerning diplomatic relations between England and the Holy See, is utterly
destitute of foundation.'"
Here is a specimen of a sort of story (as young Ladies euphemisti-
cally say) which somebody is continually telling, and somebody else
contradicting. The latter usually avows himself; but who is the
former P If a caterer of fictitious news is kept by some of our con-
temporaries to fill up space, he may perhaps be describable as a
penny-a-liar.

THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION.
[A Mr. Oldham, calling himself
President of the English National
Revolutionary League, writes to the
Si. James's Gazette that murder is
sometimes no crime, and that " Kings
and priests, altars and thrones, crowns
and mitres, we regard as the emblems
of tyranny and force and fraud in
every land and every clime; and
we look forward to the time when
they shall be swept away never more
to torment and tyrannise over human
kind."]
Ho! for the poisonous bowl,
Up with the bludgeon and
dagger!
In floods of gore we shall roll,
Making old monarchies stagger.
Kings Bhall be all swept away,
Priests shall immediately
vanish;
All who have wealth, from to-day,
Socialist leaders shall banish.
Woe to the Mitre and Crown!
We shall take stern retribution;
Altar and throne shall come down,
Smashed by the Ted revolution.
All institutions are bosh,
Mankind, we know, doesn't
need 'em;
Here's to t he men who don't wash,
Dirt is the emblem of Freedom!
Murder we hold is no crime,
We 're game for assassination;
This is the teaching sublime,
Blood is the base of a nation.
So pot-house patriots scream,
Having at families royal;
But we disdain the vile dream,

not combined to carry out the

that for many years they have
ignored. Mr. Bacm, of the Aloi-

to shut his doors for not obeying
the 7th Section of the 6 & 7 Vict.

Chamberlain or the Justices to
grant a licence to "any person

Manager for the time being of the
Theatre in respect of which the

why is Mrs. Bernard Bkere
managing a house licensed to Mr.

that the name and place of abode
of each Manager shall be printed
on every Playbill announcing any
representation at each Theatre,
may we not gratify our curiosity
by knowing where Miss Gene-
vieve Ward lives, and where Mr.

Mr. Baron Muddlesome.
Baron Muddlesome {bowing to the Lord Chief Justice). Before
he commences his summing-up, I shall be glad of my learned Brother s
permission to introduce a few of my personal friends.
Lord Chief Justice Punch (smiling). I can refuse you nothing,
Brother; but I must remind you that the Bench has its limits.
Baron Muddlesome (hastening to explain). Yes, I know; and,
therefore, I have refused tickets of admission to all my friends,
except to those of the highest nobility. I have my learned Brother's
permission to introduce them? {The Lord Chief .Justice bows
good-naturedly, and the Baron ushers in—with extreme courtesy—a
number of Ladies.) And, now, your Graces, as you are all seated,
I will stand over here and explain.
Lord Chief Justice Punch (severely). Silence, Brother! You forget
yourself. Remember you are in a Court of Justice!
Baron Muddlesome (deeply wounded). I beg your pardon! (Lord
Chief Justice bows gravely.) But I would not have ventured to
address even a Stuff-gownsman with so much harshness.
Lord Chief Justice Punch (with dignity). Then, Brother, you do not
know how to maintain decorum! Not a word, please, or I shall have to
commit you for contempt. (The Baron looks aghast, and explains in
dumb-show his sorrowful annoyance.) And now. Gentlemen of the
Jury, we will get to work. You will remember that we are trying a
case of " waste." The Plaintiff is owner of a fee simple subject to the
life interest of a tenant for life. Defendant is that tenant for life,
and the Plaintiff says that the Defendant has committed "waste" by
cutting down a large quantity of ornamental timber.
Foreman of the Jury. As the nephew of a Solicitor, m'Lord, will
you allow me to express my admiration at your Lordship's
Lord Chief Justice Punch (interrupting). Certainly not! And if
you are the nephew of a Solicitor, Sir, I am surprised that your
relative has not informed you that a high judicial dignitary does not
require the praise of anyone to encourage him to perform a purely
public duty! Enough, Sir! To return. Now, there is no doubt
about the cutting down of the trees. That is admitted. The question
is, what m "waste?" And to explain this matter several witnesses
have been called. The first was Mr. Baron Muddlesome, who gave
us his definition with much legal pomposity. (Laughter.) He Baid
something about " waste" being voluntary or permissive, and hurting
the legatee, or devisee, or somebody. [Renewed laughter.
Mr. Baron Muddlesome (interposing). With all respect to my
learned Brother. I merely denned waste" as any permanent
depreciation of the inheritance.
Lord Chief Justice Punch. What a definition! (Roars ef laughter.)
Perhaps, Brother, you can tell us something more about it P
Mr. Baron Muddlesome. Certainly. Except when permitted by
statute, a tenant for life, will, or sufferance, a Bishop, or other eccle-
siastical person, and a copyholder cannot commit any " waste."
Lord Chief Justice Punch. Oh! oan't they?
[Shrieks of merriment.
Mr. Baron Muddlesome (blushing). If I am to be subjected to
ridicule, of course, I have done; but I think some respect is due to
a head of one of the learned professions 1
Lord Chief Justice Punch. Certainly, Brother'—as much respect
as you yourself would pay to a General, an Archbishop, or a Royal

Academician. I am annoyed, but not surprised at this unseemly
demonstration. {Silence immediately restored in Court.) You were
saying, Brother?
Mr. Baron Muddlesome. I was merely, as a Lawyer, giving an
opinion upon a matter of purely legal technicality.
Lord Chief Justice Punch. No doubt yon were—but do we want
this? I would remind the Jury that we have good authority for
believing that direct evidence is' preferable to expert evidence in
matters of fact. Well, we have a matter of fact. The Defendant,
a tenant for life, cuts down some timber. Does he commit
"waste?" ''Yes," says Mr.Baron Mttddlesome, and he proceeds
to confuse your minds with a lot of legal technicalities. To
quote from the summing-up in a recent very interesting trial, "the
Public in their verdicts are generally right. And by the Public, of
course, are meant the Juries who represent them. {Cheers.) Now,
what is the common-sense view of "waste?" Why, not to receive the
fall value of a thing by some action on the part of the possessor.
Did the Defendant "waste" the timber? It was ornamental—he
preferred that it should be useful. So he sold some of it and made
a ship out of some of it, and gave some of it away to a thrifty
nephew, by whom it was used to the best advantage. Now, was this
"waste ?'r
Mr. Baron Muddlesome [excitedly). Certainly it was, from a
legal point of view.
Lord Chief Justice Punch. But we don't want to look at the
matter from what you call a legal point of view. {Thunders of
applause.) No doubt there is much in what you say, and were we
discussing the affair over a bottle of port at the Bench table of Gray's,
you would have a good case, but this is a Court of Justice.
Mr. Baron Muddlesome. And surely of Law,—surely of Law!
Lord Chief Justice Punch. By which, I suppose, you mean to
imply that there is a distinction between Law and Justice!
{Laughter.) I am afraid, Brother, you take a very narrow view of
things when your judgment is warped by your professional partiality.
Now, Gentlemen, I have little more to say. It is for you to decide
the Defendant committed "waste." On the one hand, we hear
that he used the timber to the best advantage, and certainly did rot
"waste" (in the ordinary acceptation of the term) a single stick of it.
On the other hand, experts—Judges and Queen's Counsel, and so
forth—have been called before you who have, in spite of ths direct
evidence that has been adduced, sworn that there has been "waste."
No doubt they are stating exaotly what they believe to be the case,
but I must remind you onoe more that the evidenoe of experts must
be received with the gravest suspicion. Gentlemen, you will now
consider your decision.
[Exeunt the Jury to return immediately with a thoroughly
common-sense verdict.

some judicious chopping and changing, has been got at length into a
fairly presentable condition. Indeed, thanks to the inventive grace
of Mr. Alfred Thompson, to whom it owes all the "artistio merit"
it possesses, the play contains perhaps as brilliant and elegant a bit
of spectacular effect as is just now to be seen on any stage, either in
London or out of it. If there is not much to listen to, there is
certainly something that is literally well worth seeing.

I Alt
The village _ .
And I think to myself, as I read the news, and bless my life for the peace upstairs,
That the burden's sore for the best of men, but few can dream what a Doctor bears;
For here I sit at the close of a day, whilst others have counted their profit and gain,
And I've tried as much as a man can do, in my humble manner, to soften pain: , <
I've warned them all, in a learned way, of careful diet, and talked of tone.
And when I have preached of regular meals, I've scarcely had time to swallow my own.
I was waked last night in my first long sleep, when I crawled to bed from my rounds dead
beat.
"Ah, the Dootor.'s called!" and they turned and snored, as my trap went rattling down the
street!
I sowed my oats, pretty wild they were, in the regular manner when life was free,
For a Medical Student isn't a Saint, any more than your orthodox Pharisee I
I suppose I did what others have done, since the whirligig round of folly began,
And the ignorant pleasures I loved as a boy—I have pretty well cursed since I came to be man.
But still 1 recall through the mist of years and through the portals of memory steal
The kindly voioe of a dear old man who talked to us lads of the men who heal,
Of the splendid mission in life for those who study the science that comes from God,
Who buokle the armour of Nature on, who bare their breasts and who kiss the rod.
So the boy disappeared in the faith of the man, and the oatB were sowed but I never forgot
There were few better things in the world to do than to lose all self in the Dootor's lot.
So I left the life that had seemed so dear, to earn a orust that isn't so oheap,
And I bought a share of a praotice here, to win my way, and to lose my sleep;
To be day and night at the beck and call of men who ail, and women who lie;
To know how often the rascals live, and see with sorrow the dear ones die;
To be laughed to scorn as a man who fails, when Nature pays her terrible debt;
To give a mother her first-born's smile, and leave the eyes of the husband wet;
To face and brave the gossip and stuff that travels about through a county town;
To be thrown in the way of hysterical girls, and live all terrible scandals down;
To study at night in the papers here of new disease and of human ills;
To work like a slave for a weary year, and then to be cursed when I sent my bills I
Upon my honour, we 're not too hard on those who cannot afford to pay,
For nothing I 'ye cured the widow and child: for nothing I 'ye watched till the night turned
day;
I've earned the prayers of the poor, thank God, and I've borne the sneers of the pampered
beast,
I've heard confessions and kept them 6afe as a sacred trust like a righteous priest,
To do my duty I never have sworn, as others must do in this world of woe.
But I've driven away to the btd of pain, through days of rain and through nights of snow.

As here I sit and I smoke my pipe, when the day is done and the wife's asleep,
I think of that brother-in-arms who's gone, and utter—well, something loud and deep!

Of a woman who's crying for vengeance 1 Hark! No, the house is still! It's a Doctor's

GETTING OUT OF A SCRAPE.
Mb. Charles Ueauk has, in the advertising columns of several contemporaries, made the
agreeable announcement that two of his "masterpieoes" may be now enjoyed every evening
without the painful accompaniment of the " Tune the Old Cow died of." That this infliction
was neoeesarily involved in any attempt to sit out the two masterpieces in question, was,
fortunately, not widely known to all the classes of 8ociety invited by Mr. Readk's
seductive advertisements to witness them. However, it is just as well to realise that the
danger is past; though, apparently, it has not been disposed of without what may be regarded
as a regrettable inoident or two.
"This pest," says the spirited dramatist, "under which the visitors of theatres have
groaned so long, has been banished, after a severe struggle, from.the orchestra of the Adelphi."
It is to be presumed that the encounter here referred to, which evidently must have
been of a most violent and personal character, occurred at some morning rehearsal. And
it may be noted, by the way, that during the Christmas holidays this seems almost a mistake
A free fight—and there obviously must have been some very lively approach to something of
the kind—between the late Conductor and his band on one side, and Messrs. Charles
Re* db and J. E. Mallansaine, backed up by the interpreters of the new music, on the
other, could scarcely have failed to have drawn large houses every evening if properly billed
and prominently put forward as an attractive feature of the programme. However, if this
point has been missed, there has at least been something left in the shape of a counter poise.
"All the music of the evening," continues the Adelphi Wagner, is selected by me, and
I venture to think that visitors will find themselves consoled and cheered between the Acts—
not tormented as if it were a crime to come to a Theatre."
Considering the risk that the modern Playgoer has for some time been running of getting
tormented, not only between the Acts, but during the progress of the whole performance
at more than one West-End Theatre that could be named, Mr. It fade indeed deserves to be
reckoned as a public benefactor. If all he says about it be true, and there is no ground for
questioning his facts, an evening spent at the Adelphi, especially if commenced before seven
in the upper boxes, must be not only a very curious, but a very delightful human experience.
A SWEET SYNONYM.
The elasticity of language has no limits
in the hands of those who Know* how to use
it, and never before has a sweeter name been
found for murder and assassination than the
one discovered by I/>yjjO! Michel, the
Republican lady who doer *11 she oan to
ruin and discredit the Republio. She calls
it "suppression." If any steps were taken
to stop her orations at Belleville, Paris,
or the Steinway Hall, London, she would
probably call that particular form ef sup-
pression, murder. The longer word Assas-
sination she would doubtless apply to any
offioial aot that interfered, however
slightly, with her power of talking.

Of the skies where learned Love
Showed the wedding-rings of Saturn
And the honeymoons of Jove,

Was, while we were wont to grope
For the silver smile of Venus,
Lessened by my Telescope!
Simple!—Science is the sister
Of true Poesy, is said,
By the souls that, bold, have kissed her,
And I know that when we, wed,
Flew to spoon in Alpine passes,
Lodged where loveless lives the Pope,
There was glamour in the glasses
Of my ten-lensed Telescope!
Yet I guessed not when we petted

PLON-PLON IN CHAINS.
[Brief Extract from the coming "Mia Prigione.")
It was a vast venture to dare, but then when you have young
Ozobge Lachaud—the George Lewis of France—and young
Gautieb, son of Theophile, and therefore necessarily a neat stylist,
turning out a proclamation isn't half such a difficult thing as
unpretending people think. It is a good deal easier than keeping
calm at the Alma, and remaining to share the shame of Sedan. Great
coup that of mine, keeping out of Sedan 'the only Napoleon they can't
connect with that. And then the bill-sticking business was well-
imagined. First time anyone has attempted a coup d'Stat by bill-
sticking. Afterwards, one generally does a good deal in the way of
bills, and as much as one can in the endeavour to stick where one is.
But when it comes to incarceration, one hesitates. One is prudent,
even though a Napoleon; and when Jebome in addition, one is
additionally prudent. But Lachaud said they wouldn't hurt me;
and as a lawyer he ought to know. If the Party did want to
do anything desperate, anything violent, and likely to bring a man
into the ridiculous predicament of being shot, or stabbed, or any-
thing nasty of that kind, why it would only come and liberate me
when everything was successful and assured.
(Communication from De Cassagnac, asking me to go to London
with him in order to land together at Boulogne the day after. He
will provide eagle if I provide the hat. fief use. Am abominably
sea-sick; and Paul is such a desperately compromising fellow-
might get me into a serious quarrel with the military.)
Glad it's the Conoiergerie. Has a good historical sound. "Napo-
leon Bonapabte at the Conoiergerie "—why, the phrase is almost
enough to land me at the Elysee. Besides, Mabtb Antoinette was
there, and—and lots of celebrated people among whom I must now
take rank. I'm afraid I shouldn't have been at Madame Tussaub's
without this. But they might have made the arrest a little more
picturesque, the prosaio Republicans! Merely police-agents and a
Commissary! Not even a battery of artillery! But after all,
though, perhaps it was all for the best. Guns nave an unaccount -

of the enemy arc every instant sum-

Death is shocking. Not at all!
Death clears off the scum that

This o'er-populated ball.
Death is stirring, Death is splen-

And its spreading is attended
By a feeling great—divine.
Art is bosh, and Science fleeting,
But purveying for the grave,
To sword-flashing and drum-

This is business brisk and brave.
Let us urge the herd to battle;
They perhaps prefer dull life,
Driving quills, or carts, or cattle,
Knowing not the joys of strife.
Lives of conquerors all remind us
We may lead men by the nose,

OUR GLUT OF GREAT MEN.
Owing to the crowded state of
Westminster Abbey, which build-
ing promises, or threatens, very
shortly to become overcrowded
with monuments to, and statues
of, departed worthies, attention
has been called to a proposal put
forth by the late Dean Stanley
"to enlarge the place of national
burial by the erection of a Campo
Santo, or mortuary cloister, on
the space now occupied by secu-
lar buildings on the south-east
side of the Abbey." What other
country on earth is there, besides
glorious Old England, that can
Brag of having more great men
—soldiers, statesmen, divines,
philosophers, poets, painters,
sculptors, musicians, political
economists, comic novelists, and
other geniuses of every descrip-
tion—than, as represented in their
respective images and memorial
sculptures, it knows what to do
with?
AN INVALID'S NOTES.
Didn't feel up to the mark 1 Didn't know exactly what was the
matter with me, but had a Btrong disinclination to get up in the
morning, and an overpowering desire to go to Bleep in the afternoon.
Was generallydepressed, and suffered from forebodings of immediate
evil which were never fulfilled. Had an idea that the world was
against me in general, and that no one would mourn over my
approaching death, but would dismiss the subjeot summarily, not to
say with a light heart. Consulted my Doctor. He sounded me, and
said there was a harshness of breathing, and there was something
not quite right at the bottom of my left lung. 1 thought bo. I had
felt it coming on for a long time. I have always known that my life
would be shortened by lung-disease, and I proceeded to relate
several anecdotes of bronchial affections in our family, to which
truth compels me to state my Doctor did not even pay that attention
which oommon politeness demands. He said there was no ground
for uneasiness. Of course, not for him; but if he was suffering
from my complaint he wouldn't take such a cheery view of the case.
He advised me to lay up for a bit, to keep warm, and avoid night-
air. It is very easy to De a Doctor.
Laid up for a week, kept warm, and avoided night-air. Didn't
feel any better. Grew more depressed. Found myself spending
hours before the looking-glass, gazing at my tongue. Couldn't sleep
ezoept at wrong times, such as between breakfast and lunch, and
was seized with a wild passion to go to bed at five in the afternoon.
This insomnia leads to madness, and I told my dootor of several cases
of raving insanity which adorn our family history. He has probably
never had any lunatics, except himself, in his family, as he pooh-
the notion, and said that want of sleep arose solely from
biliousness. A coarse, common train of thought. The drop from
incipient insanity, about which there is something heroic, something
connected with old red-brick mansions and wainscotted parlours and
clanking of chains, to biliousness, which is nothing more or less than
over-eating and drinking, is as from murder to petty larceny. Pro-
bably if convicted of both I should prefer to be sentenced for the
latter; but I had hugged my insanity—my picture of an over-
wrought brain—to my breast, and was sorry to part with him. The
doctor kept on declaring that there was really nothing the matter
with me, but that I was low, and required much nursing; and it's
a wonder he didn't add petting. He gave me tonics, which, for
complete removal of appetite, were, I should think, unequalled.
Making no progress one way or the other. Got tired of laying up
and keeping warm and avoiding night air. Went out for the first
time to a Theatre. Smoked cigarettes, which I am strictly forbidden
to do, in draughty passages, which I am expressly ordered to avoid,
and drank brandieB and sodas, whioh 1 am commanded to shun like
poison, between the Acts. Pouring wet night, and no oabs to be got.
Walked from Theatre to Club in thin clothes and shoes. Got
soaked. Drank more B. and S.'s, and smoked more cigarettes, at
Club, and came home, wringing wet, in a very slow, stray hansom.
Felt ohilled to the bone. Did this with variations for a week, then
sent for my Doctor again. He said I was a little below par, but
that my lungs were all sound and well.
Laid up for a month. Put myself on a strict diet. Kept in a
room with a constant temperature. Tonioked myself vigorously.
My appetite returned. I felt wonderfully well. Sent for my
Doctor. Said there was no absolute danger, but both my lungs were
congested. I felt delighted that I had really got something tangible
the matter with me at last.

are—as a Bayswater wagwould observe-
You find the Central Hall deserted, so you dash up a staircase
whioh leads to the Courts. You have been told that the Bar
Corridor is to be sacred to those who have a right to wear horse-hair
wigs and stuff or silk gowns. To your surprise you stumble over a
most miscellaneous set of persons. Here is a loafer you last saw
marching with the Guards' Band from Wellington Barracks to the St.
James's Palace, there a club-window man, who has not the remotest
connection with the gentlemen of the long robe, yonder a country
parson, who, accompanied by his wife's father, is showing his bride
all " the sights o' London." Of one thing you feel certain—that these
persons are neither Witnesses nor Jurymen. As you walk rapidly
along, you see a chamber labelled " Consultation Room." You peep
in, and find two telegraph boys playing at pitch-and-toss. Again
you advance, and on your left you notice some recesses suggestive of
boxes in an old-fashioned cook-shop, which are supposed to be for
the convenience of a Solicitor and his Clients. They are evidently
intended for the argument of knotty cases of intricate law. On this
occasion they have been put to other purposes. As you pass, you
perceive that the mother of a family has secured the table of one of
these recesses for the discussion of the noonday meal of a numerous
offspring.
But these are details. Here are the Courts themselves. You push
open a spring-door, which immediately oloses behind you with a
bang. There is a general and angry cry of " Hush 1" A Judge is

lor amateur theatricals. He has a door on either side of him, and
doors to the left and right. Before him is a mahogany desk, under
which you expect him to sink and to reappear as someone else—like
a forensio Mr. Woodin. And this suggests a notion. Until things
settle down a little, a great deal of the time of the Court is sure to
be wasted. Might not some of that time be employed in a theatrical
entertainment P Mr. Justice Chittt, for instance, would be seen
to infinite advantage in Number One Sound the Corner, were he
supported by the most promising of his colleagues. To return to
"the real," the narration of which may be treated for a moment in
dramatic form:—

But it is only fair to say that some of the Judges were well satisfied
with their new quarters. For instance, Sir James Hansen was under-
stood to intimate (by those who could hear him) that he considered
the acoustic qua-
lities of his Court

fection. But even
he was a victim

his arm-chair. However, he was patient, and assured the Bar
he could hear them very well. Could they hear himP This
was a great opportunity for a gentleman in a very, very new
wig, who until now had had little or nothing to do with the
proceedings. He jumped up, bowed to the Judge, and assured his
Lordship that his Lordship's syllables were as clear as crystal. Then
he smiled, and sat down rejoicing in the success of what was evi-
dently his maiden speech. This was received most graciously by
Sir James, and the banging and the crashing went on as before. No
doubt the Judge was contented, but to make him quite happy the
assistance of an ear-trumpet and a voice-magnifier, such as those
that are used during a storm at sea, seemed absolutely necessary.
In the Court of Appeal the Master of the Rolls was found consult-
ing with his oolleagues, seemingly quite unconscious of the fact that
an Equity man was prosing away, pleased but unheard, amidst the
reverberations of closing portals and the laughs of private conversa-
tions. Fortunately, most of the Barristers had much to say about
the law before the
date of the Judi-
cature Aot, which
they seemed to
know a great deal
better than the law
which has been
introduced by the
passing of that
interesting little
measure. So, if
their arguments
failed to reach the
Bench, not much
was lost, after all,
to anyone. But as

are of great value, they at least should not be lost by being imper-
fectly heard. So, were they arranged as glees, and sung with deep
feeling by the eminent lawyers specified, they would nave a fair
chance of producing a profound and lasting impression.
But now the time had arrived for a refresher. There was a rush
down-stairs in search of luncheon. The successful and the briefless
hurried together down dark passages and gloomy staircases, until
they had sunk, seemingly, many scores of feet beneath the level of the
street. Then, when they had reached the lowest level, they found
themselves before a door leading to what would have been called in

so cold, comfortless, and dismal. And to what use was this gloomy

once again) "the calls to the Bar " were fast and furious. Those at
the tables, however, were less demonstrative—preferring " shop " to
eating. Of a verity may it be said, "When Silk meets Stuff, then
comes the tug of bore."
THE FANCY DRESS-BALL AT THE MANSION
HOUSE.
The Lobs Make and the Last Maress seems to be going it, they
do. There ain't no fear of the grass growing under their feet, how-
ever it mite wish to do so in such a werry plezzant place as the
Manshun House.
Not content with the but if ul Children's fancy Calico Ball as they
gave about a fortnight ago, and which as I said at the time was the
iovelyest and most beautyfulest site as even I ever seed, they last
Funday asked about a thousand growed up folk, includin some of
the most d is ting-wished people in the whole City of London and else-
wheres, with no restrickshun to Calico, but with no admission unless
in Fancy Costume, ezcep for us Gentlemen in atendance, to come to
a grown-up Ball.
Ah, that was summat like a Ball that was, and quite a study of
oarackter to us lookers on. You see when you asks a Gent to dress
hisself up in the disguys of some great man of past times, you at
OBoe finds out who he most admires and riverences and would ha'
liked to have been. For instance, if you sees a Gent who when he's
at tome is only a Common Tradesman, and when he's out only a
Common Councilman, dress hisself up like some great Ero of old, you
knows at once as that man is not a fulfiling his propper destiny, and
that he no dout wastes his life a pining and a longing to be a Nero
instead of a mere tradesman or a C. C. Then again, if he gos in for
looking like one of the lower orders, you at once sees as Nature
intended him for sum think of that low hignorant sort, and for a
nydle hour or two he feels quite at his ease, and much more at home
than when freckwenting the sosiety of the Bo Mond, such as Sherryffs
and Aldermen. And to us Waiters who knows amost all on em
werry well indeed, and had sum times seen 'em in their weaker
moments, it was great fun to see 'em strutting about in what was
littorally their borrowed plumes, and a trying to look like Statesmen
or Poets or Gentlemen of other days, or great Captings, or old For-
reners of Distincshun, or even as Feelosophers. But still, for all
that, it was a butiful Bite, plenty of colour, plenty of wariety, plenty
of wittles, and plenty of light, the Electric Light, tho' I hates it
with a mortal hatred perf eshonally, making every think look brighter
than ever.
One thing as struck me and all my Brotheren werry strongly, was
the fact that having to support a charackter as one isn't used to,
and to wear close as one isn't used to, does seem to have the most
extrorniary effect of making everybody dreadful thirsty, I'm sure
the constant stream of eros and statesmen and solgers and nobble-
men, mingled with some of the rather lower orders, as kept a-coming
into my refreshment room, was sum think wunderful, and one and
all, igh and low, seemed.all as thirsty as soles.
The Lord Mark with that nateral desire to add dignerty to the
I igh office he adorns, surjested to the Last Maress the King and
I Queen of Dimonds as crackters apropriate to the occashun. But the
I Lady Maress, as I were told by one of her own maids, she says to
her loving spowse, says she, No, my Lord, there's somethink as
we prizes more than lovely Dimans, and them's loving Arts, and
■o we'll be drest up as the King and Queen of Arts.", And so
they was, and never yet since fancy Dress Balls was first inwented
'airy Land was such a magnificent couple seen as they was on
last Fursday evening, and Brown ac shally said, and it warn t bad for
Brown, that they had made Arts trumps and held all the honours.
The sillybrated Mr. Terry the tragedian was there, with his
butiful dark brown Squaw as he saved from the tiger in Wirginnia.
He had bin a-playing his grate charakter of the Wild Man of the
Woods, and hadn't time to exchange his customes, so the kind Lady
Maress said, come as you are, and he come.
There was only one Sherry tf. which was rayther a damper on sum
of our sperrits, but the principal under Sheryff, Field Marshall
Pontefec MAsnrcs, with his flaming robes, quite restored us.
How that dreadful looking Casual managed to get in when noboddy
wasn't a-looking rayther shocked sum of us, till we was told as he
was a sillybrated Dook in disguise, and then of course we all admired
him immensely. He certainly played his part to the life and looked
as tho' he had bin born in a Workhus and bread in a Casual Ward.
Brown, with his usual imperance, spread the report that one of the
Sherryffs was a-coming, just for this onoe, as Mr. Marwood, under
the assumed name of Mr. Marwood Tuck'kmi r. but of course it
warn't true. One or two of the Aldermen was really got up splendid,
quite like Old Masters, as sumboddy said, tho' aa I didn't know him
myself, I of course couldn't see the likeness. One in partickbxr looked
so family picture like, that even Sir F. Layton hisself would have
allowed him to have sum " Hartistie M err it."
I'm afraid as I cannot say quite so much truthfully for all the
numerous Common Counselmen, tho* some of 'em did look so grand
that I reelly ardly kno wed 'em. I think sum of 'em might have
come more in reel carackters. For instance, I should ha' liked to
have seen the 1st Commisshunerof Sewers as a reel live Scavenger of
the time of Eddard the 3d, the founderer of Butiful Billingsgate.
That I should think would have been a reel picture. Then the ener-
gettick Chairman ef the New City School might have come as John
the Carpenter, of the Founders Company, who preoeeded him and Sir
John Mpnktun in the same rain, and his Reverence Joseph Harris
might have come as Joseph Rienzy, "the last of the Latins."
These would have given a local flavour to the whole thing, just like
the introduckshun of a little Turtil Soup at Supper.
Brown said as one Gent was meant for William Tell, tho' how
he could tell that I'm sure I don't know, excep that he carried a big
Bow and looked werry cross eoz sumbody stole his Appel. Another
was Oliver Cromwell, tho' praps, judging from his marvellus per-
formance at supper, Oliver Cram well or Oliver Twist would ha'
been a better name for him.
There's no accounting for taste as the Waiter said when he tasted
Zeedont, you never can, but the guys as some on 'em made of thsir-
selves was a caution. Sum of the werry thinnest legged People, with
lima like Mr. I hying, seemed to find quite a plezzure in exposing
them as much as possible to public gaze, tho' certainly not to publio
admyrashun. Sir Walter Rally reminded us a good deal of the
Grand Old Man, for he kept a pitting of his collar up all the evening
and it did make him so wild. But lor bless all their arts it does seem
rayther a funny thing for a lot of respectabel grown-up people to go
and dress theirselves up in other peoples' clothes and try to look like
sumbody else.
But it's all werry emusing, and sends the money a flying about,
and serves for a lot of armless gossup for Ions; ears arter its all over,
and all on 'em has recovered from the intoxication of the evening
and has rewerted with a sy to the sober rayment and the sober enjoy-
ments of their ordinary dumdrum life. _

BOBS AND BADGES.
To
a correspondence on the important subject of "Medals in
Evening Dress,"—a combination of the ma-
tary uniform with the Civilian costume—
which some Retired Officers have been carry-
ing on in the Morning Pott, a veteran survivor
of the Crimean War contributes the sug-
gestion that such officers "should wear
miniature medals, and those on full pay their
original ones." The propounder of this nappy
thought signs himself "An Old Light Bob.
It seems perfeotly feasible; though a minia-
ture duplicate of a war medal might bear too
muoh the aspect of a bogus medal; precisely
as the denomination of a "Light Bob
suggests the idea of a bad shilling.
V Talking of "An Old Light Bob," somebody
may say, what Officer would it now be prop«r
to call a "New Light Bob"? Of course the answer is obvious-

Qriggles. "Hui.lo, Dumplbt! What are tot/ rkadino! 'Christmas
NuMBKK OT THK LiNCBT! PUT IT SOWN, AND COMB AND HATB A GAMK o'
PYRAMIDS!"
THE LAY OF THE ICHTHYOPHAGIST.
[The first of a series of Meetings, which it is proposed to hold
throughout the Metropolis for the purpose of calling attention to
the operations of the " Billingsgate Fish Ring," took place last
week in Clerkenwell ]
'Tis surely too bad there's no fish to be had,
In bulk or in delicate slices,
In all London town though you roam up and down,
That's not sold at terrible prioes.
We know fish is good, 'tis most exquisite food,
Assisting the brains of bread-winners.
And yet it's so dear it's too painfully clear,
The poor can't afford it at dinners.
You wish for the whole of a freshly fried sole,
Red mullet we know is inviting,
There's joy in crimp'd skate, as all gourm-.tt can state,
And excellent flesh on a whiting.
We'd feel very odd if deprived of our cod,
Spring dinners would surely be gammon
Without the sweet fish, that is pink as the dish,
The grand, unapproachable salmon.
I've oft in a dream seen the pleasant sea-bream,
The lobster is gay in apparel,
I honour the crab, and the prawn, and the dab,
And oysters that come in a barrel.
The haddock and plaice bring a smile to my face,
And whitebait a careful cook sprinkles
With flour; e'en the eel a fresh joy will reveal;
And oh! I am "nuts" upon winkles!
Then "Down," let us sing, "with the BillingsgUe
Ring!"
That makes fish too dear to be eaten.
Let markets abound, so one day 'twill be found
These rascally salesmen are beaten.
Hold meetings and spout till reform comes about,
Keep up a ne'er-ending commotion,
Till many cheap fish shine one day on the dish—
The harvest that comes from the ocean!
NAPOLEON POUR EIRE!!
La RSpublique loquitur:—
Ha, ha! Imposing pose! Travesty quaint!
Plon-Plon, mon p'tit, whatever are you after?
Ho, ho! _ La France languit! If France feels faint,
'Tis with the effort of spasmodic laughter.
But come, you must not play heroic pranks,
Like a tragedian with the blade and cup.
A nuisance, worthy, not of bonds, but—spanks.
Shut up!
Your masquing as the Corsican is queer
As that of a political Tom Thumb.
You are but a Napoleon pour rire;
What do you, Plon-Plon, in this galley? Come I
Your " Manifesto " will not raise a scare;
'Tis a mere popgun, Plon-Plon, not a Krupp.
And as for that cocked hat of yours, why—there!
\_Bonnett him.
Shut up!
SHORT COMMONS.
We have very little Common-Sense, and equally little Common
Honesty, and this year will probably see the last of _ our Common-
Lands. The few yards of unappropriated earth which have been
left to us in the heart or in the outskirts of our great towns are all
marked, tabulated, and deposited in the shape of railway, building,
or sea-canal plans in the pigeon-holes of Parliamentary Agents.
The chance of getting something for nothing—something which,
belonging to everybody, is often defended by nobody—is too tempt-
ing for the Maeaires, Diddlers, Turpins, and Sheppards of the
architectural and engineering profession,—
"Rattle your bones over your stones,
We've taken your Commons which nobody owns."
Tramways and railways to Hampstead Heath, railways through
Wimbledon, like the sweet things through Wandsworth, railways to
High Beach;—these, and a hundred similar schemes, are hatching
to complete the work begun years ago by the aristocratic squatter.
The Lords of Bad Manners sometimes congratulate themselves that
Parliament throws no obstaole in the way of public robbery, by
having no Standing Orders to prevent the promoters of Private (and
Confidential) Bills from oompulsorily acquiring Common-Lands,
which "are much cheaper than enclosed land."
We refer all persons who are interested in these questions—that is,
nearly the whole population—to the Commons Preservation Society,
6, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and we ask its energetic Secretary, Mr.
pBscrvAL BraxETT, to keep his eye on the Ecclesiastical Commis-
sioners. These gentlemen have been asked to give up nine out of
twenty acres of Lambeth Palace Grounds for the benefit of a poor
and crowded neighbourhood, and it remains to be seen whether they
will comply with this reasonable and proper request. This governing
body is large and mixed, comprising two Archbishops, twenty-eight
Bishops, five Cabinet Ministers, three Judges, three Deans, and
twelve Laymen, but when it is a question of giving to the poor, and
consequently doing what is manifestly right, even suoh an unwieldy
Committee as this ought to be prompt and unanimous.
"The True Position of Parties."
By a Troubled Tory.
The Standard and the Quarterly contend
Upon this subject, but to what clear end?
My own position is a giddy-valse one,
Vertigo seizes me, my brain s confusion.
And lean only come to one conclusion.
Our Party's "true position " is—a false one!
Mas. Ramsbotham finds the two Mewses'at the back of her house
in Bloomsbury a great nuisance, and how the Ancients managed to
endure Nine of them she cannot imagine!

Air—" My Old Friend John. *
"Mr. John Euskin has been again elected Blade
at Oxford."
'Tis forty years, our old friend John,
Since your first work we read;
Foraging midst your noble tomes
What nappy, nappy hours have sped I
With you we ve scaled the mountain side,
And pulled the purple heather;
Methinks it seems but yesterday
Since we first met together.
Since we as boys
First knew the joys
Of Ruskinese together.
Methinks it seems but yesterday
Since we first met together.
There's pleasure in remembrance, John,
As eloquent, as true
Are you as in the spring of life,
Wnen first you wrote and drew.
We miss some glowing rhetoric,
You've tightened trope's gay tether;
But fancy decks your periods still,
As when we met together.
When we, as boys,
First tried the joys
Of Ruskinese together.
Methinks you seem as golden-tongued
As when we met together.
Farewell not yet we '11 bid you, John;
You say your prime is o'er;
But he who Modern Painters penned,
Will write, and charm, much more.
Art owes you more than to the herd
Of prigs who cant and blether;
We honour yon as in the days
When we first met together.
When we as boys
First tried the joys,
Of Ruskinese together.
Through many sunny years, friend John,
May we yet live together 1
HINTS FROM THE HINDOO.
The " Indian Contingent" which visited England last year seem to
have enjoyed themselves thoroughly, judging from the letter published
in a " local journal" from one of the Officers, whose simple surprise
at all that he saw is quite touching. As the Contingent considered the
Crystal Palace to be "the finest building in London," and " better
than Windsor Castle or Westminster Abbey," and as they remark
that the Franco-German War Panorama at Sydenham, is " the finest
picture in London," we are bound to conclude that somebody must
have been playing practical jokes on these decidedly childlike guests
from India's coral strand, when they were sojourning in our midst.
Will the next batch of distinguished foreign visitors report to their
"local journals " as follows ?—
We Redskin braves were delighted to visit England. Were told
it was the home of Freedom and Fire-Water, and we all like Fire-
Water. Immediately on landing at Dover we found such a nice
Gentleman waiting to conduct us everywhere. He asked us how
much money we had about us, and said he would take care of it for
us, and took us to a hotel in London, which he said was the largest
in the World. But we did not think it so very large, and the rain
came through the roof into the little room, and the floor on which we
all slept was rather hard. The Nice Gentleman said he was the
Representative of the "Universal Grand Press and Telegraphio
Bureau," and we should see the Queen, and the Prime Minister,
and Newgate, and all the finest buildings in London.
One day we visited the Houses of Parliament. We wondered why
there were so many people lying in little beds arranged all along the
walls. The Nice Gentleman said that there had been an " all-night
sitting," aad Members were always ill after that. In one room
which we noticed was called the " Accidents' Ward," the House of
Lords was assembled. At least so the Nice Gentleman said; but we
were surprised to find so many with their arms bandaged, or their
slung by bands from the ceiling. The Nice Gentleman told us
'between the Two Houses,
and then there were always a few scalps taken, and other trifling
injuries among their Lordships." We asked why a man with a case
ot instruments made one of the noblemen wince so, and we were told
that it was "only the Cloture being applied for the first time." We
had heard of the Cloture, but did not know it was like this. We
should not like to have the Cloture applied to us.
After leaving the House, we were introduced to Mr. Gladstone
and Lord Granville, who seemed quite pleased to take us into a
dirty little house, where we all had a good deal of fire-water
together.
When we went down to Windsor to see the Queen, Her Majesty
was indisposed, and could not reoeive us, at which we wept bitterly.
However, we admired the Castle very much. The Nioe Gentleman
told us it had been the home of the Kings and Queens of England
ever since the Flood, and we believed him, because we saw the Flood
quite plainly from the top of the " Round Tower."
Another day the Nioe Gentleman told us he would take us to the
Maze at Hampton Court. None of us knew about Hampton Court,
or what a Maze meant. We were pleased to see such a fine new
building in the Strand, and to know that this was Hampton Court
Palace. There were men with red and blue bags, and curious white
things on their heads, which the Nioe Gentleman said were called
barristers' wigs; he said that the reason why the hair was white
was because it was the hair of their great uncles, which these men
had raised," and were punished by being obliged to wear it always
afterwards. But we should not think anything of scalping a great
uncle. The Maze itself was very clever. The Nice Gentleman placed
us in one corner of the building, called "the Chanoery Oihces,"
and there left us to find the way out. He said this was always what
was done with visitors, and we tried it; but it took us three hours to
get out, so we did not enjoy ourselves, and we were taken up several
times by Policemen, who did not seem to understand the occupation
we were engaged in. Still, we consider it to be Number One Maze
in the World. Subsequently the Nice Gentleman telegraphed "he
thought we should be amazed," and so we were. We have not

MORE LIGHT!
Sir,—In reply to the carefully considered letter of your correspondent,
"A Gboper in the Dabk," dealing with the respective merits of Gas and
Electricity for purposes of domestic illumination, and strongly advocating the
employment of the latter wherever practicable, I can only say that my experience
has led me to a very different conclusion. My country-house is a large one,
and I was recently induced by a scientific friend, who is largely interested in
the success of a recent patent, but whose judgment in the matter I had no reason
to doubt, to give the new agent a fair trial. Contracts were speedily entered
into with the Dynamo-rotating Duplex Incandescent Electric Insulator Company
(Pollikoff System), with the result that, at a cost of £7314 16». 5rf., my pre-
mises were Boon supplied with the requisite number of lights, of 190 candle-
power each, the whole being fed by sixteen powerful dynamo-maohines, situated
in various parts of the building, and driven by a three-hundred-horse-power
central-eDgine, attended day and night by a couple of stokers, and placed in
a oonspicuous position in the entrance-hall. But here our comforts may be said
to have ended.
Though I have Bilker's patent Life Saving Switoh attached to every burner,
and a capital appliance by which the current can be diverted at a moment's
notice, no less than three friends who were spending the Christmas with us,
received such appalling shocks and other severe injuries, when incautiously
admiring the extreme ingenuity of the apparatus as they were dressing for dinner,
that I have since heard from their Solicitors that they can never recover.
Add to this, that the continuous shaking of the engine is rapidly bringing
the staircase down, and that, owing to the red-heating of the wires, carelully
cased by Zeringer's process in the wood-work of the floors, we are" obliged to
telegraph to Bolsover for the entire fire brigade whenever we sit down more
than six to dinner, and you can picture the sort of life the new agent is
leading us. Only the other day my wife's uncle, a cheery and hale old
country gentleman, calling to wish us the compliments of the season, sat by
mistake on a small Oroove battery, and went out of bis mind; while at the
present moment I am being charged with the maintenance of a coachman, three
butlers, and a local piano-tuner, all permanently paralysed, in the Qeneral and
County Incurable Asylum. Under the circumstances I have no hesitation in
giving my preference to gas. I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,
Shockwell Hall, Hants. W. T. Sldmbfr.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
Sir,—Your Correspondent, "A Wafping Rector," may soon
assure himself of the purity of the gas supplied to him by the Com-
Eany to which he refers. Let him take five pounds of aoetate of
arytes, a peck of common tar-ash, three ounces of hyperphosphate
of dynamite (Bolt's is the best), and mix the whole in a twenty-
gallon copper over a brisk coke-lire, taking oare not to stir too
rapidly for fear of an explosion. When the mixture, which has a
peculiarly pungent and unpleasant smell, comes to the boil, let all
the furniture of the room to be tested, which has previously had the
door fastened securely with cobbler's-wax, be thoroughly saturated:
window-ourtains, blinds, and anti-macassars being hung in dripping
condition. Now let him light his gas. If in a few moments the
whole of his drawing-room suite becomes a rich streaky mottled
brown-black, he may rest assured that the gas is pure. This is an
infallible test. T am) Sirj yourg) &0i
_<EsCULAPTUS.
Sir,—I have the misfortune to rent a house in a suburb, the supply
of gas to whioh is a monopoly in the hands of the South-Northern
District Light and Coal Company. 1 have not been in residence
three months, but every ceiling in my house is coal-black, while the
apology for light, for whioh I am paying at the rate of seven shil-
lings and ninepence per thousand cubic feet, is furnished me in the
shape of a dull, yellow, flickering, mephitic vapour that I am assured
by experts is slowly poisoning my entire household. No sooner do
we let the Company's deadly compound loose on us through the
meter than I am invariably seized with acute symptoms of apo-
plectio coma, terminating in a fit, that is only relieved when I am
placed horizontally outside my own drawing-room baloony, and left
there for hours in the dark. In this uncertain weather, such an
alternative is almost intolerable, and I appeal to your powerful pen
to help me. I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
An Electric Shareholder.
Sir,—" A Sufferer " is quite in error in attributing the "beat-
ing sensation as of red-tot hammers on the temples" as experienced
by himself and the "few friends " who dined with him on the 10th
inst, to the quality of the gas.
Any soientifio acquaintance could have informed him that common
ooal-gas in combustion, giving off f reely'bi-sulphuret of carbon and
the volatile acids in high solution, would naturally produoe the
sudden copper-coloured hue he noticed in the complexion of his
guests. Such a phenomenon is perfectly compatible with an illumi-
nating medium that may be regarded, from a sanitary point of view,
as quite innocuous, and to direct public attention to the f aot merely
shows that he is ignorant of the very first principles of sound
Chemical Science. The alleged violent nightly choking of the baby
on the nursery-floor I really cannot seriously discuss. The merest
novice knows that hydro-oarbonate of sulphur, liberated in excess,
will induce all the symptoms of violent strangulation, accompanied
by acute asphyxia.
I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant,
The Chairman of the Implicated Company.
Sir,—If any of your readers has still a doubt as to the immense
superiority of eleotricity over gas as a lighting and heating agent,
he has only to visit my premises to satisfy himself once and for all
on the subject. For years I have been trying to read by gaslight,
in a deadly stupor; dull, morose, disheartened, a burthen to myself,
and an intolerable cause of discomfort to my friends. Last month,
however, I was persuaded to give the new light a trial. The change
has been wonderful. _ I am now all over the place. I skip up the
stairs. I play practical jokes on the tradesmen who call for orders
at the adjacent houses; and I find myself Bitting up the whole
night in the wildest spirits, singing comic songs out of the first-floor
window till the police positively interfere. Several summonses have
already been taken out against me. In fact, I am an altered man.
You are at liberty to make any use you like of this letter.
Yours, &c,
An Honest Enthusiast.
Sir,—Having used gas for many years with the result that I have
for some time past been practioally without lungs, I last month, at
the advice of a friend, fell back upon eleotricity. I now have no
eyeB, and am confined by my Doctor to reading theatrical posters
through red spectacles, and these only by moonlight. As far, there-
fore, as the merits of the respective illuminating media are concerned,
my attitude is at present that of A pATIBNT iKQUiber.
rifle and bore.
Br accounts from Vienna we learn that a certain Herr Mannltcher
has invented a new repeating-rifle which he calls a " Magazine Gun."
The repetition in that Magazine appears to be quite a terrible kind
of tautology.
VINDICATING THE LAW.
The far too numerous Licensing Authorities who are entrusted
with the Government of London Amusements, are playing a not very
dignified game of shuttlecock with Theatrical property. Their object
appears to be to toss official responsibility
from one to the other, so that, in the
event of any catastrophe, it will be diffi-
cult to hang the Lord Chamberlain, the
Chief of the Police, or the Chairman of
the Board of Works. The Alcazar
Theatre, after a fight of several weeks,
has been closed by a Bow-Street Magis-
trate, who has been set in motion by
the Home-Office. The Board of Works
have deliberated, as only a Board can
. ... -*j OSO^^' v'V deliberate, the Lord Chamberlain
has hesitated, as only a Lord Cham-
berlain, without funds to prosecute,
can hesitate, and the Police have politely declined to use the
authority given to them by an Act of Parliament. The " disorderly
house " has at last been olosed, but not before a publio scandal has
been created; and a number of people are thrown out of employment
who ought never to have been employed, and a quantity of capital is
wasted that ought never to have been expended. How long are we
to wait for a Licensing System that is short, sharp, and well-
defined, and that is in the hands of one man who knows his own
mind, respects public-requirements, and has some knowledge of
Theatrical business? For the moment Justice is asleep!

BACK TO THE PLAY.
When no longer you're a rover o'er those horrid Straits of Dover,
When you've settled all the business that's gone wrong while
you're away
On your wanderings Continental, when you've paid the quarter's
rental,
You bethink yourself of seeing what they 're doing at the Play.
The Lyoeum has a Benedick that draws a pretty penny,
The aooessories are splendid as accessories can be;
While, as Beatrice, Miss Tekry we call fascinating very,
And Miss Mill ward as young Hero is a pleasant sight to see.
At the Haymarket a oomedy shows Bancroft as a " gommy,"
They have given one more revival of the Robertsonian plays.
Mrs. B. again is Polly, so hilarious and jolly,
And with David James and Brookfield, Caste should run for
many days.
There's Charles Reade and Henry Pettitt bid for cheap applause,
and get it,
For the Gods" have loved Bensation since the Drama's earliest
age;
Or you visit the Prinoess's, where the pleased spectator blesses
Jones and Herman for a sound play that's a credit to the Stage.
There's a Pantomime at Drury Lane, late full of sound and fury,
And 'tis pleasant to see children think the Play so sweet a boon;
At the Standard, too, and Surrey there is Pantomimic hurry,
With the old time-honoured "wheezes" for the Clown and
Pantaloon.
At the Globe we '11 hope Jane Eyre a most decided avit rara,
They have given up Great Alfred and have gone to Mister Wills;
And since all folks knew the Poet was in ne'er a sense a " go," it
Seems they've made a resolution just in time to change their bills.
We have Impulse at St. James's; where, amid the playbill names, is
That of Hare, one asks in wonder, but the piece is very fair,
While in Comrades Coghlan's utter firm repose sets in a flutter,
Many hearts within the theatre that borders on Sloane Square.
At the Gaiety each stanza of the new Extravaganza,
Wins much laughter and folks crowd in to John's histrionic shop;
At the Vaudeville The Rivals seems the best of all revivals,
And you see in Mrs. Chippendale an able Malaprop.
The Criterion Miss Belsu'weVL deserves the cheers she gets j I
Can advise the Op'ra Comique and the troupe of Lila Clay;
So the list might be extended, but 'tis time our verse was ended.
Choose your piece and call a Hansom, and then roll off to the Play!

The French Claim to "Control."
French journalists and politicians express great indignation at
the refusal of the British Government to re-establish the Dual
Control in Egypt. In the meanwhile it seems likely to become an
European question, with regard to a country existing with a Govern-
ment and a Legislature at sixes-and-sevens, in a condition of continu-
ally recurring revolution, what sort of control—du.il, single, or
plural—it may be possible to place France under?

There was a Social Journalist who thought that he'd be wise,
He went through his "smart article," and scratched out all his

But when he saw his "I's" were out, this egotist so vain,
Went straight through that " smart artiole," and scratched them in

TWO QUEENS OF BEAUTY. APHRODITE-ALEXANDRA.

VlHUS loquitur:—
As Queen to Queen—of Beauty, I am come,
Heart-Sovereign of your northern island home,
Lipped, like my Paphos, by the whitening foam.
Thanks-bearer to that gentle royal heart,
"Whioh knows right well that Beauty's better part
Is still to deal the balm, not wing the dart.
Thanks-bearer! 'Tis an office gladly borne
By her who ruled in the earth's radiant morn,
Whioh she who ruleth now need scarcely scorn.
Lady, you've bettered Lesiiia. All her crying
Could not again set one dead sparrow flying,
Your word shall save a myriad! birds from dying.
The " Tournaments'of Doves " have shamed your isle,
And isle-born Venus thanks you without guile,
Who will not crown such lists)with your bright smile.
Let them their Queen of Beauty rather seek
Mid such hard dames as sat, with unblanched oheek,
"What time Rome's lists with guiltless blood would ret-k.
My favourite birds in red-flecked heaps they lay,—
Your English chivalry! Brave quarry, they,—
"Butchered to make a British holiday."
Not in your sight I The grave rebuke is just.
Let Sport—and luore—sway them, if they must,
To wanton slaughter. Yet not long, I trust.

And Venus—and her doves—tender you'"
EXPELLED PRETENDERS.
The Orleans at Twickenham. Back again, hut it isn't
exile to us; and, at any rate, we have those restored
millions in our pockets. It was rather a nuisance to give
up Paris in the winter season, and not see an Opera ball,
and the Princesses would have liked to have had the
primeur of the Spring bonnets. But, after all, Twicken-
ham in winter mud is not nnutterablv worse than
Chantilly, and there are beginning to be really pre-
sentable bonnets even in London. Besides, as my faithful
Boschet points out, we are far better situated here for
conspiring, since they will have it that we are conspira-
tors. No more military duties to occupy us; no more
worldly duties and pleasures to divert us from politics;
no more idea of duty to the Government we serve (and
there are Princes who have the idea, whatever Roche-
fobt, who was once Orleanist, may say); we shall have
all our time and all our money to spend in undermining
the Republic. And having sent them into safety, that
clever Republic can't catch the underminers.
The Legitimists at Oratz, or Frohtdorff. The idea of
exiling us! Why, we have never been anything else
save exiles all through our illustrious lives! But now,
thanks to the aureola of martyrdom officially bestowed,
there is really a chance of our going back. For the
beautiful new law doesn't exile the servants—it only
expels the responsible heads; and the further the respon-
sible heads are from the centre of operations, the less
likely they are to lone them, and the more likely to have
them crowned. Have sent orders, in consequence, to
Chakette. He can go a-head as soon as he likes now.
We are out of danger, and the Breton loyalists can't
complain that we are afraid to come amongst them. The
Republic has denied us that sovereign glory: and if it
would only prohibit us sending cheques and Post-Office
orders to devoted but impecunious supporters in France,
we might manage one of the cheapest and safest Restora-
tions yet on record.
The BonaparUs at Montaclieri. Out of prison, at any
rate, and now we can employ our native Italian ounning
in our native Italian clime. It was difficult to keep a
talon about us in France, what with that horrid C ass a g n a c
and Victor, who won't rush into the paternal arms with
anything like enthusiasm. Now, we can conquer an ally
—and an ally who wouldn't at all mind doing something
disagreeable to France; and I begin to think that bring-
ing a Bonaparte back would strike France as rather
disagreeable. Don't seem to be rising at all to the Legende
NapoUonienne as annotated by J eko ne. So, am beginning
to sound brother-in-law Humbert with regard to a loan
and army, and if he makes it a condition that we are
reconciled with CLOxn.DK—well, we '11 even go that far—
until we can get as far as Paris.
A LETTER TO THE EDITOR.
{More Heal than Ideal.)
Mr dear Six,
We intend holding a Fancy Bazaar here on
March 19th, for the purpose of obtaining funds towards
the restoration of the church-tower. 1 am not aware
whether you have ever visited our town, but if so, you
must remember the church. It is a square building,
of brick, with large and spacious galleries, and is reve-
rently whitewashed every year—indeed, it is a perfect
specimen of Georgian architecture. Now, success would
be assured if you would send down a Reporter and an
Artist to describe and sketch our meritorious efforts.
"Would that my husband's house were capable of enter-
taining them, but it is very small. However, I am told
there is very fair accommodation for those who do not
mind roughing it, at the "Railway Arms." Please
•ay "Yes." And any subscriptions you would like to
forward, will be thankfully received by
Tours sincerely.

The Bishop [severely). "When / was tour age, my young Friend, it was
not considered Good Manners for Little Boys to join in the Conversa-
tion of Grown-up People, unless they were invited io do so."
Small American. "Guess that was Seventy or Eighty Years ago.

NOT DEAD YET!
Hooray! English cricket is still "all alive oh!"
We thank you for proving that same, Captain Ivo!

But, faith, you'd convict 'em of " bangs," dashing Leslie.
Or, if you should want f urtherproof, why I '11 trouble you,

The opposite quite will be shown, "clear as mud,"
If you 'R study the deeds of the two brothers Studd.
And what jolly duffers the croakers will feel,
When they tot up your tidy analysis, Steel,
Ah, bah! They will turn, in a very short while, coat,
At sight of the right slashing scoring of Tylicote,
And drop the ass-hoof that old England would spurn, on
Pernsing the record of resolute Vernon.
Not in it? Get out with your Smelfungus yarns,
There's lots of sound " thrashing" yet left in our Barnes;
And though he mayn't slog 'em from Cook ham to Marlow,
Like Bonnor or Thornton, there's " stay " in our Barlow;
Whilst better than casual sixes or eights
Are the steadily-piled threes and fours of smart Bates;
And though, like his Captain, he's been a bit poorly,
Australians will oft cut their " sticks " before Morxey.
Here's his jolly good health! health and luck to the lot of 'em!
And as for the oroakers who talked so much " rot" of 'em
When down on their luok, but are now mute as fishes,
The team can dispense with their doubtful good wishes.
The Captain might boast, Ivo Bligh, "I've obliged 'em
To ' shut,' and, as Sairey would say, have ' surpriged' em."
You have, Sir, and we to your pluck, grace, and skill owe
That we o'er " the Willow " no more need sing " Willow!"

HOW BULL-APIS WEST UP AGAINST TEL-EL-KEBIR.
FraG1£Z3TT8 OF AX EPIC OF MoDEBJT EOTFT.
by the Shade of the Poet P«ntaocb, aforetime
Lyric Chronicler, and Rhythmical War Correspondent to Raxxsxs II
Enta Bull-Apis marched to the eastward, to the borders of Kilns he came;
He marched with his six-foot sword-wielders, his tubes that could thunder forth
With the troops of his pocket-SESosTBis, which same was a friendly nickname.
But ere he was come to the river, the Sly One of Egypt arose,
From the wilds, and the slums, and the prisons he summoned Bull-Apis's foes;

They gathered as frogs in the marshes, they all at Tel-el-Eebir lay,
In anticipation of looting, in prospect of increase of pay.
Eing Hull-Apis heard, and he armed him, like Mkstt he rose in his might,
He buckled his belt for the battle, he buttoned his boots for the fight,
And swift from the stalls in the rearward, from the stables of Boll-Apis came,
His steeds that were mighty to bear him, the stout Sizteen-Stunners their name;
The Pad-hes, the Sand-hes, the Jon-hes, he gathered them all for the war,
With the Azure-Shirts, sons of the sea-god, the guns, and the iron-sheathed car.
But the guns of A-ba-bi by hundreds were ranged in his road, and there lay
The hordes of the Sly osk of Egypt as a bar in Bull-Apis's way.
Of the tribes of the Franks none appeared, and the rest of the nations stood far;
But the tag-raggy troops of the Sly On k stood there ready ranged for the war.
Was there one of the battle-ranks with him? Of the Captains and hosts was
there one?
Nay, but they held far from the battle; King Bull-Apis stood there alone.
Then Bull-Apis cried to Okanpolman, "Look here! Shall I, solus, go on?
Wherein have I erred, 0 Gbajtdolman P This deed at thy word have I done.
The laws of thy mouth I transgressed not, nor went from thy counsels astray.
The straight-tip from thee have I waited, 1 'ye patiently walked in thy way.
And now underfoot by these Fellahs shall sturdy Bull-Apis be trod?
Thy tongue, 0 Grandolman, can square it, or it were remarkably odd.
Behold, it is thou that hast done it. I blame not thy counsels, I cry,—
Give the word, and I'm game for the tussle." Gran holm an he winked with
his eye.
He cried, " I'm Grandolman, as ever, a peace-loving party, my son;
But at present I'm right on the war-path, like Ra, the Victorious One,
My heart is afire d la J in-go, I stretch forth my hands to the fray.
Your warriors, Bull-Apis, are ready, I'm ditto. So go it 1 I say."
He spake, and his word was accomplished. Bull-Apis shot forth to the fight,
And before you could say " periwinkle," he charged, and the foe was in flight,
And there stood the Sly One of Egypt, but not very long there stood he,
Beholding the rush of Bull-Apis right promptly he turned him to flee.
And the Eing was alone. Then he halted his bravest, and cried, " That is done!
It was hot while it lasted, my heroes, but this is the end of the fun."
• • • • • *
Then the boss of that show, even Tooth-tick, he pluoked up his courage and
said,
"This is what I call real good ' biz.' For A-ra-bi, 0. off with his head I"
But Bull-Apis cried to him, "Steady, 0, steady, my loud Chanticleer!
I must have my trade-ways unblocked, but gocd Fellahs from me need not fear
Eing Bull-Apis fights not for booty; he means only kindness and
And—well, you just ask my Grandolm an if I have a thirsting for
The nations who left me to do it, now seem in no end of a state;
But—I mean to clear out, I assure yon,—as soon as I've set things all straight."
• «•*•••
And now when the horsemen and footmen, the stout Sizteen-Stunners, and he,
The pocket-Sesostbis, right hand of Bull-Apis, had come o'er the sea.
They were praised e'en as Mxirru the Mighty, the sword unresisted of Ka,
With banquet, and bunting, and buncombe, great honour, and sounding Huzza!
The nations seemed flummoxed and doubtful; they said,
"'Tis Bull-Apis's style;
He marches to fight with a hymn-book, he collars a land
with a smile."
Gbawdolxax, the tongue-swift protested, and Pussi,
the silken-pawed, purred,
"Bull-Apis was great in the battle, but peace and
plain-dealing preferred."
Sware they, "He means making things pleasant all
round, now he's crumpled his foes."
And, in ideographical Coptic, the nations responded, with

A Silly Liveryman.
PRIVATE BILLS AND PROJECTS.
Tnf. Society for the Preservation of Commons and
Open Spaces is doubtless awake to the fact that the
Railway Bills of the imminent Session threaten to lead
to the absorption of more than 420 acres of forest and
common - land. In par-
ticular, the New Forest is
id by competing
to Bournemouth,
of which, perhaps,
may, however, happily
suoceed in defeating the
other. Epping Forest is
also endangered by the
projected line from Ching-
ford to High Beach. A
plague of both your lines!
And surely the latter
scheme should be opposed
by the Corporation of
London. Or is it that the
proposed route is to be
made to please some silly
Liveryman?
The suburbs of London, already spoiled by Railways,
are destined, if certain Private Bills pass, to worse
despoilment by Tramways. It is actually proposed to
force a Tramway through Kensington! That effected,
the next progressive improvement probably will be a
Tramway to traverse Kensington Gardens.
"Facility of access" is a valuable consideration cer-
tainly; but what if the means of access to any given
place make that place not worth going to P What will
be the good of getting easily and cheaply to the New
Forest and Epping Forest, if Epping Forest and the New
Forest shall have been cut up and ruined P And will
not increased "facilities of access" to the suburbs
convert such suburbs into slums still worse than those
they have been turned into as it is, and render them
still less worth being resorted to for refreshment and
recreation than they nave now become P
Opposition to intrusive inroads and encroachments on
peace and quiet, beauty and repose, is scoffed at as
"sentimental." As if the promotion of sordid and
barbarous joint-stock speculations were prompted by any
wiser motive. As though a sentiment were something
less rational than a propensity, and, in particular,
Ideality were more stupid than Acquisitiveness.
_ Utility must always, of course, be the first considera-
tion—for speculators who simply want to invest money
to advantage. But shouldn't it be considered that the
end of unlimited utilisation for the sake of profit must
necessarily be that everything that is lovely and makes
life worth living will, at the pace utilisation is proceed-
ing, be ultimately used up?
Taking Another Glass.
, "To see ourselves as others see us," there is nothing
like looking into the criticisms of the intelligent
foreigner. Such an one. Dr. J. Scherb by name, has
been oriticising English literature. He tells us,
amongst other remarkable things, that Bybow's Myrrha
is "not inferior to any female character of Srak-
spearb "! Or. Schebr himself is manifestly not only
"not inferior," he actually rises superior to Nature's
favourite child. Shakspkare held the Mirror up to
Nature; but Dr. Scherb holds the Myrrha up to
Seaespeabe.

DIARY OF THE PREMIER ABROAD.
_ Chateau Scott, Cannes, Saturday.—Here I am at last, and rather
tired after journey. "Complete mental and physical repose,"
Andrew Clarke said. Well, it's a blessing to be coddled some-
times. Feel as if I should like to live here for ever. Delightful
surroundings. Olive-groves, oranges, aloes, myrtles, and palms.
If I felt stronger, should wire to Tennyson that here I am among
the "palms and temples of the South," but perhaps had better keep
quiet. Hope I shan t be bothered by seeing people. Hope Card-
well and Childers won't call. If Randolph Churchill comes
down here for his health, 1 shall have to leave for mine.

that "blue isles and snowy mountains wear The purple noon's

ley, but description not bad, except that no " snowy mountains"
anywhere near Cannes.
Tuesday.—Trip to the He Ste. Marguerite to-day. Jolly! Had
pio-nic near house where Bazaine was confined. I cut down boughs
of trees, and Wolyerton boiled the kettle. Proprietor of land objected
to cutting down trees, in French. Couldn't quite make out what he
Baid, but gave him oopy of Blue Book on Egypt and my autograph,
and he went away. Glorious sunset! Bead one of Lord Salis-
bury's speeches before going to bed, and slept for twelve hours
on end. Randolph has arrived at Nice. Don't care!
Wednesday.— Caught by family translating Irish Land Aot into
Greek in corner of the grounds, under an orange-bush. They
threaten to telegraph for Andrew Clarke, and make me promise
not to do it again. I do so willingly, as I don't want Andrew
Clarke here. Feel in position of much greater freedom and less
responsibility when my Doctor's five hundred miles away. Good
fellow, Clarke, but likes coddling me, and I don't like being
coddled.
Thursday.—Slip out of grounds, and wire to Hartington, con-
gratulating him on his recent speech, which I managed to read
under the bed-clothes, this morning.' Capital speech! Also wire to
Clarke to ask him if he really meant complete repose, or only
"sufficient repose." He wires back, "complete, otherwiselaryngitai
epidermitis is sure to supervene." Don't want to get laryngitai
epidermitis; wish Doctors wouldn't frighten one so. Don't mind
seeing visitors a bit now; in fact, rather like it. Find myself
wandering about grounds, repeating best parts of undelivered Mid-
lothian speeches to the oranges, and denouncing Northcote in an
undertone. Card well oame in and caught me just at a splendid
peroration; provoking; couldn't finish it. Shall try in bed, to-night.
Friday.—Touch of the Mistral, to-day. Why " Mistral?" Look
it up. Clarke told me to "beware of the Mistral." Can't help
it; must do a good ten-mile walk, and olimb a mountain. Ask
Childers to come with me. Says he'd rather not; never climbed
a hill in his life. Go up by myself, and feel like the youth in
Excelsior. Back, and draft rough sketch of London Municipal Reform
Bill. Slink out after dinner, and telegraph chief clauses to Firth.
Crowd of French peasants at gates of villa, waiting to catch a sight
of me. This devotion deserves a reward. _ I explain to them prin-
cipal provisions of Irish Arrears Act, at which they seem surprised.
Query:—Do they understand my French, I wonder?
Saturday.—Feel glorious! Never knew suoh health in my life 1
Air like champagne. Up early, and out down all Lord Wolverton's
favourite trees before breakfast. Then, as I can't stand being
coddled any longer, effect exchange of dress with passing ouvrier,
and go off to Esterel Mountains with axe, hunch of bread and cheese,
and oopy of Homer and new County Franchise Bill. Spend a
delicious day. Come back, and find family have been scouring
country for me, as there was a report I had been carried off by
Irish-American Fenian corsairs I Family have really telegraphed
for Andrew Clarke. Don't oare if he comes I Hang Andrew
Clarke! Hang the Mistral 1 Feel brimful of spirits. As Andrew
Clarke is coming, shall take little trip to Genoa—why not Monaco?
—and do as I like. Salisbury is at Nice, and I am sure I oan get
him to join me. No doubt he knows a " system " or two. Great
fun! Quito pleasant to think we can join hands about anything I
How much better I am I "Join hands'—at cards 1 Not that cards
will be quite the game. But still it is a very good joke for a con-

SHABP-looking Lawyers and pigeons. On the whole, the latter

creatures, flying about the yard of the Guildhall, and under the
immediate patronage of the Lord Ma yob and the Court of Aldermen.
It is strange that the City Corporation should have chosen pigeons
for wards—it would have been more appropriate had they selected
doves—turtle-doves. However, there are the pigeons, and they
perch at the door of "the Commissioner's Court." The pigeons are
left behind, and this is the interior of the hall of Justice over which
that good Scotch watch-dog, Commissioner Kebb, presides whenever

either side of him is a wainscoting, semi-circular in form, suggesting
that behind the boards is plenty of accommodation for the brooms,
brushes, and other impedimenta of the old lady who does the charing.
No doubt, to remind the Commissioner that he should keep cool and
not lose his temper, there is an enormous barometer, whioh seems to
have been borrowed from a scene in the after-part of a Christmas
Pantomime. The general impression on entering the Court is that
everybody is talking at one and the same time. And the impression
is not altogether erroneous. The Plaintiff and the Defendant, in
spite of their representatives being present, are hard at work contra-
dicting one another. Principals in other oases are loudly discussing
their chances of success, while two Solicitors in strange-looking
stuff-gowns are loudly contending for vocal-mastery. A half-hearted
effort to preserve order is made by placing a couple of placard's on
the walls requesting " Plaintiffs " to keep on one side of the room,
and " Defendants "on the other.
""Why are those Solicitors wearing gowns?" asks a newly-called
and inexperienced Barrister, who has looked in, possibly with a view
to obtaining some " soup "—a nickname for chance briefs.

cheeriest of City Policemen, protecting a barrier. His Honour
seems to like it."
The Commissioner appears to glory in the noise. He waits until
he catches something with whioh he disagrees, and then pounces
down upon the speaker like a oat upon a mouse. He reminds
one of an agile performer playing upon half-a-dozen kettle-
I drams. Now he gives a tap to the Defendant, now to the
I Plaintiffs Advocate, now to the mild-looking Gentleman in a
I Barrister's-wig, who, seemingly, is the Court's Registrar, now to
four Witnesses who will speak together. Then he keeps quite
silent until the two Advocates are once more fighting hammer and
tongs, when, after a few minutes' pause, he suddenly brings the
to a hurried conclusion, by abruptly announcing his decision.

recognition of the hearty simplicity with which it is conducted. It is
only fair to add that, in spite of the noise and confusion, the best feeling

Solicitor.

a bright and neat costume, looking as if they wished to be
taken for the ideal heroes of that capital tale, Bandy. They
are, moreover, most careful in" their diction, whispering "bad
language" whenever they have to make use of it in giving their
evidence. In fact, it is a most painful duty to a Policeman when-
ever he has to swear himself before entering the witness-box.
A case of assault is heard, when the greatest possible interest is taken
in the condition of the prisoner, so far as his sobriety is concerned,
by everyone in Court. One Witness considers he was "intoxi-
cated," another " perfectly sober," a third " not drunk, but a little
in liquor." Each of those called upon to testify seems to have a
different standard of " alcoholic deportment." However, the Alder-
man decides against the luckless defendant, and finally addresses
him very much as follows, evidently framing his style upon a
hanging-Judge presiding at the Old Bailey :—
"You have been guilty of three most serious offences. You have
been proved to have been drunk, to have committed an assault, and
to have refused to give up a ticket." At this point the prisoner
plucks up his courage. This is a very grave matter, indeed—
so grave that I must deal with it with the utmost severity. Had
you struck the Plaintiff in a fatal part, you might have been
guilty of murder; had you, in a state of intoxication, burned down
a house, you would have committed arson: and, by refusing to
deliver up your ticket, you might have caused, by the delay arising
out of your refusal, an accident entailing the loss of scores, if not
hundreds of valuable lives." Here the Alderman pauses, and the
prisoner turns pale with apprehension. "Under these oircum-
stanoes," continues his Worship, in solemn tones, "in spite of the
pain it gives me, I muBt deal with you with the utmost severity.
The sentence of this Court is, that you shall be taken from hence to
the office of the Clerk from whence you came,"—the prisoner by this
time is in a fainting condition, and soarcely hears the following
words—"where you shall pay sixty shillings and costs, and
may "But here the Alderman pauses abruptlv, and the con-
clusion of the Death Doom remains unspoken. And so the matter
ends.
If the Guildhall Police Court is "respectable," the Justice Room
at the Mansion House is even "more so. Here the work is done—
nearly entirelv—by Mr. Martin, the Chief Clerk, who seems to
tolerate with cheerful kindliness the presence of the Lord Mayor or
the presiding Alderman. When Sir Roeert Carden is in the Chair,

offioials that the huge Sword of State which hangs over the magiste-
rial bench may descend unexpectedly upon the devoted head of the
nominal Dispenser of Law and the actual Preserver of Order.
However, when it is remembered that the worthy Alderman seems
to possess a charmed life, good-hnmour is instantly restored, as it
is felt that any inconvenienoe to which his Worship might be put by
such an awkward contretemps would certainly be of a purely tran-
sitory character. To sum up—Justice east of Temple Bar does not
appear to differ materially from Justice east of anywhere else.

When the waves are lashed by the wind-flouts wild that come with

Of their hurrying wings like harpy-flights that prey on the troubled

Beats clamorous, cliff-high, mad assault all round our island shores,

In an everyday cool sort of way, as a matter much of course;
The style in brief of the Life-Boat Man, no Saint perchance, nor Crichton,
But a man low pay won't check or stay, and the chance of death won't frighten
Ready! All round our sea-scourged coasts, you will find him, prompt at call,
When the winds are out, and the waves are up, and the black sky frowns o'er all
When the rook-reefs teeth or the quicksand s suck imperil the helpless ship,
And it means grim fight with the mad sea's might to slacken the storm-fiend's
grip.
Ready! The cot may be warm and snug, whilst the sea is wild and chill;
The wife may look wistful, and ill at ease, as wives of the humblest will.
Reward? Why yes, he may win some pounds, if he dares the wave's mad strife;
But tisn't a Peerage that lures him on to the hazard of life for life 1
Yet forth'jhe goes I Now, the oynio knows of worldly lore good store,
Perhaps he will say if it may not pay, round our rook-bound British shore,
To have such men as the Life-Boat Man, men simply,
oheaply brave,
Aye ready to enter the lists with Death, and not to sky,
but save.
And perohance some souls of a softer strain may feel some
tenderer thrill.
Well, Gentlemen, neither cheers nor sneers will the Life-
Boat coffers fill.
The time of tempest is on us now, 'tis the hour for succour
steady;
The Life-Boat Man at hit post is found—British Public

HONOURS UNDIVIDED.
Mr. Punch, ever ready to note and do homage to
heroism—(witness his appeal on another page for the
work of the gallant Lifeboat Men)—makes here his
admiring and respectful bow to Miss Jessie Ack, who,
when a heavy sea was running at the Mumbles one
day last week, finding a rope improvised from her
own and her sister's shawls useless to rescue a struggling
sailor drowning amidst the wreckage breaking on the
rock, boldly flung herself into the water, and saved the
man's life. So Mr. Punch is proud to chronicle in his
own page the courageous act ox this Miss Jessie, who
is clearly not only an Ace, but a very Ace of Trumpt.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A LITTLE ABROAD.
(A few Notes of a Return Visit to Paris via Monte Carlo.)
Iir consequence of a tremendous suocess at Monte Carlo—of which,
more anon, for I am sure my "system" will be useful to all my
readers, and to thousands yet unborn—I was able to stay a few days
and nights—I prefer the nights—in Paris. I seized this opportunity
because Paris itself may not be able to offer it me again this year.
Foreigners don't like to go for pleasure to a place where a reign of
terror may commence at any moment, and where you may be awoke,
the morning after your arrival, by the Chambermaid who has

"Very Like! Very Like! "—Hamlet.
become a Petroleuse, entering your room, accompanied by the Boots
and gigantio porters with tri-ooloured cockades in their hats, swords
in their hands, and pistols in their belts, ferociously insisting on
taking you off to be snot as a spy, simply because your Conversation
Book in three languages, your Illustrated Guide to Paris, and your
Ollendorff's Easy Method of Learning French in Sixty-four
Lessons, all lying by your bedside, have been considered as pieces de
conviction quite sufficient to seal your fate with the Communist
Committee, which has been pronounced the Government de facto
since 4 a.m., while you were in your first sleep.
Paris is in a deuce of a state that's evident: the Garcons wait on
you anxiously, as if they would like their pourboires in advance, not
knowing but that the next minute they will have to hide in the
cellars to avoid servioe at the barricades. The Half-World is having
a pretty good time of it, on the Bhort-and-merry-life principle, and
the Three-quarters-World flock in crowds to the numerous
gambling Clubs for all classes whioh have gradually sprung
into existence,—to the Cafes, to the Bals Masques, the
Restaurants and the ill - ventilated and uncomfortable
Theatres, which, when there is any attraction at all, have
never been more crowded than they are now, or, from a
fire-panic point of view, more dangerous.
J r Die appeared in a new musical pieoe, M'mzelle Nitouche,
which, some of the Critios said, was remarkable neither for
wit nor tune, and is now a great success, so that a queue of
people is seen all day at the box-offioe anxiously waiting to
get seats whenever and wherever they can. It was the same
at the Eden-Thidtre, where there was, on the morning of
my visit to the bureau de location, some considerable delay,
on account of the clerk having, as far as I could make out,
quarrelled with the lady who assisted him in letting seats for
the extra matinees, whioh made him very short with the
public generally, on whom he tried to revenge himself by attempting
to seat everyone as near the big drum and cymbals as possible, if
you wouldn't have this, he selected a good draughty place, and gave
you, defiantly, a ticket for that. I was very polite to him, but it
wouldn't do, and, yielding to his nasty temper and to pressure from
the single file behind me—in these painful circumstances anyone
would move on,—I accepted the position he offered, and in the
evening sat in a most refreshing draught.
But it is the " Victorien Bra" of the Drama in Paris, and it is at
the Vaudeville, where the Great Saras herself is playing the heroine
of Sahdoc's Fidora, that the demand for seats is beyond the supply
for three nights a-head. Here, outside all day are those pests of
Parisian theatres, the " touts," to be seen hanging about, pretending
to sell what they haven't got, and worrying the weak and the
simple. Their continual presence suggested a brilliant Anglo-
Parisian jeu-de-mot, which I let off on a friend, to whom, as I
pointed out one of these fellows as a specimen of the rest, I exolaimed,
Noscitur a sociit, et voild Tout!" [N.B. The directions for making
this joke successfully are, first: that " Tout" must be pronounced as
in English; secondly that your friend be an Englishman, who under-
French and his own language. The right'of .reproducing this
side-splitter I have secured by International Copyright.]
At last the police have determined to come down upon
these touting gentry pretty sharp, and it is just as well
the police of Paris should do something to show they
have still some of their old power in the streets, where,
with a policeman oalmly looking on, you can be knocked
down and run over without any official interference, and
then be fined twenty francs for obstructing the thorough-
fare. Yes, this is one of the things which we manage
better in London.
In two or three parts I like Sarah muchly—L'Stran-
gere, for example—but "I know her tricks and her
manners," and, as a rule, am not her devoted admirer;
bat I am forced to acknowledge that her Fidora is a
triumph of dramatic Art. In the Third Act I forgot that
it was Sarah, and saw only Ftdora, In the Fourth Act,
in spite of my being compelled to ask myself why on
earth when everything was supposed to be going on as
happily as a honeymoon ought to do, she should still
affect towzled hair, and look as if the previous night's
supper had thoroughly disagreed with her, I was soon
fixed bjr her " glittering eye," became oblivious of her
affectations, and again, when she was once in action, I
followed her every movement right through that terrible
bit of realism where her lover turns on her like a raging
lunatic, and seems almost to shake her head off in his
attempt to throttle her, until, having escaped from him,
she takes poison, and rolls off the sofa—a corpse!
Paul Berton acts up to her, and acts really well
when with her; but, when left to himself, plunging
about on a soft sofa, and diving his head into the sofa
cushions, with his heels uppermost, like a porpoise at
play, sobbing, "Ma Mere I ma Mere !" he is eminently
unmanly and peculiarly ridiculous. The Parisians, however,
applauded him, though here I fancy the claque led it; but a
Parisian audience are always ready to applaud anyone, in any
situation, who sobs, and shouts, "Ma Mere! ma Mire!" if he
only sobs and shouts loud enough. There is no reality, no touch of
nature in such an hysterical exhibition of grief.
But as to Sarah, she is Fidora. The piece may be, and will be
easily adapted for the English Stage, will attract, and will be a
success with all who have not seen Sarah, but I am unable to name
any English Actress who can really play this part. And this is no
disparagement to our Aotresses, as the Play is, in effect, a one-part
pieoe, and that one part was written for Sarah. As the song says,
It's all done for the sake of Sarah I" Mr. Bancroft has pur-
chased it for the Haymarket, but unless he secures Mr. Irving,
between whom and Sarah there is a remarkable resemblance, and

induces him to-;— but this is an improbability which it would be
only waste of time to discuss, though the notion can be suggested,
as above, piotorially.
After the Theatres, at some of the Cafes the Parisian " Masher"
is in great force. He is not so much en evidence in the theatre
itself, though he is dotted about here and there. He is just the
same as his London brother of the same order. He wears a white
waistcoat, a white tie (fancy that!) round a stiff white collar, an
immaculate shirt-front, but not always with one stud in the centre,

—usually two or three,—a shining hat with very much curled-up
brim, and he carries a stick with a gold knob to suck, which, when
applied to his lips, seemed to produce on him a soothing effect simi-
lar to that of the india-rubber mouth-piece of the pap-bottle on a

baby in the cradle. In this respect the " Masher " of to-day is an
exact repetition ofj the "Gent" studied by Albkut Smith some
twenty-live years ago. If the night is cold, the Parisian Masher,
evidently a weak creature, comes out strong in an elaborately fur-
trimmea overcoat. Just now he specially affects the Eden-Theatre,
where there is suoh a ballet as I have never yet seen, and of which,
in our time, the Alhambra has not approached within even measurable
distance. It is called Excelsior, and is divided into a Prologue and
two Acts, illustrating the triumph of the Genius of Civilisation over
the Spirit of Obscurantism. The Prologue is the best. There are
men-dancers as well as women-dancers, all equally good. The pre-
cision of the ensemble is admirable, and the effect—I speak of the
Prologue—marvellous.
The scenery and costumes can be done as well here, or better; and
if the entire troupe could be brought over for the re-opening of the
Alhambra, it would be a fortune straight off to the Management.
They are all evidently trained dancers, and have been drilled and
disciplined by a stern autocrat; while the varied tableaux and the
constant kaleidoscopic combinations and permutations are triumphs of
ingenuity.
The theatre itself, called Eden-Thiatre,—on the lucut a non lucendo
principle, as there is no Paradis in it,—is an extraordinary place,
with refreshment-saloons, bars, corridors, and foyers, where, during
the entr'actes, the crowd try to circulate while listening to music by
the Hungarian band, and some monotonous performances on the
core de chaste. Stout ladies in Tyrolean costumes invite the
Masher to refresh himself with liquor at the bars, for the heat is
intense, and the crush greater than I ever remember to have seen
anywhere except on some very special occasion at the Promenade
Concerts. The entrance to the Ambulacrum portion is three francs,
and to the Stalls nine. There are about five or six hundred Stalls,
besides strapontins and portable seats which, thank the Lord
Cn amherlain, would not be permitted in any London Theatre.
There is a great deal made of Lbsskfs and the Suez Canal in one
scene, but no reference to England in Egypt. The "Marseillaise"
once heralds the triumphant arrival of the French Engineers in the
St. Gothard Tunnel, when they rush in and embrace the Italian
Engineers, and kiss them on both cheeks, after which they all dance
together. The "Marseillaise" awakened no response among the
audience, and was subsequently played as a polka—and, in fact,
it was to this arrangement of the National Anthem that the Engineers
danced off.

THE SPORTSMAN'S EXHIBITION.
By Our Special Johnnie.
Look here, old Chappie. Very glad to oblige, don't you know.
But why want me to go up there so early in the morning? And
such a morn in', too, as it was on Friday, to go splashing about
Islington! Drizzlington would be a better name for that extra-
ordinary suburb. Haven't been there since La Fille de Madame
Angot. See they're buildin' a new Theatre. Hope it'll be as
amusin' as the old one. Wish you wouldn't ask me to go out on
muddy mornin's. Got so splashed in hansom cab that my own tailor
wouldn't know me. As for my boots—they were quite unfit for
publication. How with driver about fare. No one seems to know
fare to Drizzlington—Islington I mean—every one has his own idea
on the subject, which never seems to coincide with mine. Coincide?
Go inside t Very good I Of course 1 went inside. Being a Sports-
man's Exhibition, I became quite the sportsman at onoe. I said
"Yoicks !" to the man at the wicket, but he did not respond with
enthusiasm. So I looked cheery, and enjoined him to "Hark
forrard I" With that he became very angry, and pointed me out
to a policeman. By the way, what is the meaning of "Yoicks!"
and Hark forrard.!" I possibly swore at the good man in ohoice
Islingtonese, without knowing anything about it.
Oh. yes, I was very mueh pleased when I got inside. It reminded
m* of a mixture of the old Polytechnic, the Hill at Epsom on Derby
Day, a bit ef the beach at Brighton, and a touch of Madame
Tussatjd's. There were a lot of coaches and cabs, and carts and
carriages; horses all taken out. and drivers gone to dinner. Many
people seemed so have come in boats, and a very good way of comin ,
too, this beastly weather. I saw a heap of wonderful things. There
were some curious brogues which the Irish Fishermen wear to acquire
their accent in Donegal, and there were gaffs which they blow when
they want to give information. I also saw some very curious corn-
crushers, which, I understand, are highly recommended by some of
our leading chiropodists: there was dubbing, always used by the
Quf.kn when conferring the dignity of knighthood upon one of her
subjects; there were dumb jockeys — excellent on a quarrelsome
race-course; and there was saddle-soap, a capital thing to prevent
your falling off. don't you know.
Let me see, old Chappie, was there anything else? Oh dear, yes 1
There were cross-eyed guns for shootin' round the corner, 1 sup-
pose—the ejector gun. which they must find very useful in Ireland
just now, and a lot of smart, gay-looking boats, called, I know not
why, dingies. I also noted some chaff-cutters, most invaluable for
using at dinner-parties, on race-courses and in the House of Commons.
Among the few live things there were some clay pigeons, and some
decoy ducks. There were a lot of drags, which you know are used
for huntin', and some ladies' spurs, which are supposed to incite
them to all kinds of good deeds. Oh, and a lot of other things! You
must go yourself, and have a look. Can't expect me to tell you all
about it when I 've been so splashed. They ought to have a lot of
men in red coats there, and have a run with a salmon, or stalk a
fox, or course a partridge. Plenty of girls in country costumes to sing
sportin' songs, would be an excellent notion. Tried the man with
"Tantivy 1" as I went out, but it was of no use. I'm splashed if I
have anything more to do with sporting matters!

A MYSTIC RITE.
Mr. Macbeth and Mr. Gregory were, last week, elected as worthy
to be Associates of the Royal Academicians. The ceremony of Mr.
Macbeth's initiation was peculiarly striking, as the official Repre-
sentative Artists could not lose the opportunity afforded them by
the new Associate's .Shakspearian name. The Council Chamber was
fitted up as The Witches' Cavern, a Calderon was in the centre, and
the dramatis persona- were as follows:—
Macbeth ... By Himself.
1st Witch . . . Sir F. Leiohton, P.R.A.
2nd Witch . . . J. C. Horsley, R.A.
3rd Witch . . . W. P. Frith, R.A.
After an incantation, arranged for three voioes, whioh was very
finely sung, The Second Witch announced that, " By the pricking of
thumbs, something clever this way cornea. Open looks whoever
knocks!" upon whioh Mr. Macbeth entered, ana was presented by
the Weird Sisters with "a deed without a name," whioh the new
Associate had to sign. Then, joining hands, they danoed to
mysterious music, played by Mr. Sant, R.A., on a concealed
harmonium, and while throwing into the Cauldron old paint-
brushes, broken palettes, bits of easels, chips of maulsticks, dry
leaves from Ruskin on Art, Blackbukne's Illustrated Academy
Guide, and an old Catalogue of the Grosvenor Gallery, they sang—
"Come high or low,
Thyself and office deftly show!"
when the thunder was splendidly shaken by Mr. Herbert, R.A.,
and in a vivid flash of lightning, also contrived by the same talented
Artist, arose a Head, wearing a Judge's wig, whose features were at
onoe recognised by everyone present as those of The Last of the
Barons.
Macbeth. Tell me. thou unknown power!
First Witch. He knows thy thought.
Second Witch. Hear his speech, but say thou nought.
Third Witch. Or be committed for contempt of Court.
The Last of the Barons then made a few learned observations on
Art in general and experts in particular, and after making a few
learned observations on Art and experts, the Baron was courteously
dismissed, cigars and liquors were produced, and dancing round the
Cauldron was kept up to a late hour.

Mr. Bass or Sir Arthur seleot something from Meyer-beer? The
answer is evident. The satirical M.P. for Burton-on-Melancholy

the Opera, all the guests are poisoned by wine, and are led out

"For myself I am never satisfied that I hare handled a subject properly

Oxford.
Three Notes on above from an Undergraduate'» Diary.
Returned from lecture stamped and thoughtful. Wonderful
things the old boy says about colour. Odd idea that, now, of his to
have a fresh bit of rock-opal on the table, and dip it into a bucket
of water, to test one's sensibility to prismatic beauty. Mem.—To
try it. Order a pound or two in from Spiers. Can't quite believe,
though, it will show anything that will be a patch upon our Boating-
Club colours. What does he mean, too, by this?
"Entirely common and vulgar compared with these, yet to be noticed
as completing the crystalline or vitreous system, we hare the colours of gems.
The green of the emerald is the best of these; but, at its best, is as vulgar as
houte-painting beside the green of birds' plumage, or of clear water."
Don't fancy Florence will see this, and give up sporting her engage-
ment-ring. Birds'plumage,"—that must be bosh. Hecan't be think-
ing of that dusty weather-beaten old parrot in the High? And as to
clear water,—come, I '11 back an average emerald against the Cher-
well any day. Perhaps, though, he had Sandford Lasher in his eye?
Shouldn't wonder:—still, take it at its best,—it's not what I should
call a "killing" sort of green. However, I'll turn it all over as
soon as Spiers sends in the opal. "It presents more lovely colours
than can be seen in the world, ezoept in clouds." Evidently, he has
been walking on Sunday afternoon to the top of Shotover to see
the sun over Carfax in a fog. No accounting for taste, but—well—
if it comes to clouds—give me a three-vol. novel, and a pipe full of
bird's-eye.
• ••*••
Quite converted by that last lecture, and no mistake. Am
so glad. I went through the whole course. Mind quite changed
again now. Break off engagement with Florence, because she
won't give up wearing that staring, vulgar, gimcraok, emerald
hoop, and take to a little natural ring of freshly-picked chick-
weed. Very aasty of her, I think, ana really vile taste 1 Never
mind—I can keep it up. Go into chapel crowned with moist
cabbage-leaves. Fined; but no matter. Hide my Uncle's carbunole
signet-ring, explaining to him that " unless set in tinfoil," it is not
prettier than the "seed of a pomegranate," and that he must live
up to a higher standard of Art. Calls me an "upstart jackanapes,"
and strikes me out of his will. Console myself by emptying a jog
of clear orvstal water on the head of the Regius Professor of
Divinity. When he sends for the Prootor, explain to him that the
Sassionate admirer of colour can see less glory in the priceless
iamond than in the simple dewdrop, and that as he is dripping
from head to foot, he awakens in me a feeling of unbounded admi-
ration. He says, that" may or mayn't be," but that he suffers
badly from rheumatism, and he'll have'me " sent down for a term
or two." Celebrate my departure by an oyster-shell supper.
When some of the men want to throw me out of window, try to
make them understand that the real beauty of the oyster is not the
miserable fish one eats, but the glorious oorrusoating preoiousness
of the nacre of the shells one looks at. Ducked. Hit out right
and left. Give the Senior Censor, who intervenes, "one for him-
self" by mistake. Says, for the moment he sees "the purest rain-
bow-tints, as glistening in meridian sunshine on a butterfly's wing,"
all at once in Ms right eye. Quite believe him. Rusticated. Never
mind. Take rook-opal with me in a carpet-bag.
• • » • • •
Changed my mind again. Must be right this time. Made it up
with Florence. Just read in my lecture-notes, "The ruby is like
an ill-dyed and half-washed-out print oompared to the dianthus."
Stuff! Mem.—Give Florence a complete set on the spot. Married
to-morrow. Don't talk to me of " the delicate harmony of shade in
the sea-washed tracery of virgin coral." I mean to be married in a
blue coat with brass buttons, and a red tie,—and then live in a stucco-
fronted house, with cheap cast-iron railings and a pea-green door.
It isn't exactly what I meant to do when I first went in for the
8lade Professor's'lectures, but as I have contradicted myself and
everybody else at least three times, I ought to feel tolerably satisfied
that I'm right at last. Mem on final note.—" In reverenoe is the
ohief power and joy of life." Now, what does the old boy mean by
that? 1 have it! Of course,—Throto the rock-opal at my father-
in-law.

THE GAIETY NOVICE.
"Farquhar" is a good name
in connection with the Stage.
Towards the end of the Seven-
teenth Century young Farquhar,
who was subsequently to make
a brilliant reputation as a dra-
matic author, offered himself to
a Manager as an Actor, and was
accepted, "probably." says his
biographer, as a godsend, being
a young gentleman from College,
and he came out as Othello.
Fortunately for his future author-
ship, Farquhar had every quali-
fication fer the Stage, except
that he couldn't aot. He had no
voice, no confidence in himself,
and never got over "stage
fright." He probably murdered
several characters before he acci-
dentally stabbed a brother Actor
when playing in Drtsen's Indian
Emperor, after which, having
made this one hit, he quitted the
Stage for ever.
His namesake, who appeared
at a matinee some ten days ago,
does not suffer from want of con-
fidence or from laok of voice.
He made a very creditable be-
ginning as an amateur, and, as
he chose this method of intro-
ducing himself to the notice of
London Managers anxious to en-
gage a young man of fashion,

the Lancet.
Because Colonels of Volunteers
are greater men on the South
Coast than at Aldershot.
Because a great deal may be
learned by military men on the
West Pier and at the Aquarium.
Because Portsmouth has had
enough of " Citizen Soldiers " for
the present.
Because "our great standing
camp" is not exactly the place
for amateurs.
Because Prince Edward thinks
it within easy railway distance of
his Command.
Because the Corporation of "the
Queen of Watering-places " find

Because no one expects the
"Sham Fight" to be of any
military service to anyone, and,
therefore, that one place will do
as well as any other.
Finally,—because " the Duke"
has no objection.
Now that the only Frenchman
who could lay claim to the title
has departed, we must gradually
become accustomed to regard the
world-renowned Personal Con-
ductor, Mr. Cook, as the "Dic-
tator of Tours."
The nearest approach to Mid-
lothian the Premier could make
when forced to go abroad for his
well-earned rest, was "The Cha-
teau Soott."

"THE SILVER THAMES."
Mr. Punch's great motto, as all the world knows, is "Justice to
all!" Bearing this in mind, although he has had many a good
hearty laugh, and trusts to have many more at some of the funny
and old-fashioned and cumbersome doings of
the old City Corporation, he has always borne
willing testimony to their many good deeds for
the benefit of the whole Metropolis. For
instance, he hears nothing but good accounts
on all hands of the admirable school they have
just opened on the Thames Embankment, on
which they have lavished their wealth with an
unsparing hand, thanks, in no small degree, to
the exertions of the energetic Chairman of the
School Committee. He also hears from his
numerous staff of young men who are constantly employed, at
enormous salaries, in verifying quotations, and other important
literary work, that the Guildhall Free Library is as near perfec-
tion as a Free Library can well be. Free admission to all, early
and late, a priceless collection of books, a most courteous Librarian,
and careful and ready attendants. Then, again, Mr. Punch
can speak from his own personal experience of the magnificence
of their latest gift, for, fearless of risk, or even of the probable
subsequent discomfort, he rode lately, accompanied by two of
his trusty lieutenants, for hours through Epping Forest, and
although his critical eye saw many things that might be easily
improved, he bears willing testimony to the priceless value of this
grand acquisition. And now, again, when not only public gratifica-
tion and public recreation, but even public health is imperilled by
the polluted condition of our noble river, the old Corporation is
again to the fore, not as in the olden time, struggling and battling
for the rights and liberties of the people, but for their comfort, their
enjoyment, and their health.
For a long time past reports have been rife as to the simply dis-
gusting state of the Thames in the neighbourhood of the outfalls of
the Main Drainage System at Crossness and Barking. Complaint*
by the Corporation to the Metropolitan Board of Works being of no
avail, they applied to the Seldom-at-Home Secretary, who has at
length woke up and procured the appointment of a Royal Commission
to inquire into this most important matter. Strange to say, the
Commissioners have resolved to sit with olosed doors. No one except
the officers and witnesses of the Corporation, who are the Plaintiffs,
and of the Metropolitan Board of Works, who are the Defendants, is
allowed to enter the sacred chamber, or to reveal one word of the
important evidence given.
This being the case, Mr. Punch, as usual, comes to the rescue,
and sympathising with the natural impatience of the Public to know*
the facts of the case without that delay that seems inseparable from
Royal Commissions, he has again summoned to his aid his Own City
Commissioner, whose Reports upon the Livery Companies of the
City, lately published, have so exhausted the subject that the Royal
Commissioners are said to have adjourned tine die. This Gentleman,
with that alacrity that is as praiseworthy in a Commissioner as it is
unusual, has held several sittings, and has now forwarded a copy of
a portion of the evidence taken:—
No. I.—CAPTAIN CBOSSTREE.
Our Own Commissioner. Well, Captain, you know the importance
of the inquiry I am now commencing. What can you tell me of the
state of the River?
Captain Crositree. Well, Sir, I have been on it almost daily for
the last ten years, as master of one of the river steamers, and it
seems to me to get worse and worse every year.

Our Own C. Have you any doubt of the cause of this terrible
state of things?
C. C. None at all. It all arises from the fearful blunder of
emptying: all the sewage of the Metropolis into the River instead of
into the Sea.
Our Own C. Can you tell me anything like the quantity pumped
into the River?
C. C. Yes. I have a nephew employed at Abbey Mills as a
stoker, and he told me onoe that they reckoned it at about a hundred
millions of gallons a day.
Our Own C. A hundred million gallons a day! Surely there
must be some mistake!
C. C. No, Sir, there is no mistake. And I believe it's much
worse than even that.
Our Own C. Why?
C. C. Because the receptacles at the pumping stations are so
insufficient in size, that they are sometimes obligated to turn the
sewage into the River at least two hours before high water.
Our Own C. And what is the effect of that outrageous proceeding?
C. C. Why, that instead of the ebb tide carrying the sewage
towards the Sea, the flood tide carries it towards London.
Our Own C. Really, Captain, this is hardly credible.
C. C. It's quite true, Sir, and they are now about to enlarge the
receptacles in consequence.
Our Own C. How does all this affect you and your men?
C. C. Well, you see, Sir, we are pretty well used to it by this
time, but it's cruel work when the weather's at all warm or close.
I've sometimes known every man of the crew to be as siok as so
many land-lubbers on their first sea-voyage.
Our Own C. Thanks, Captain, that will do for to-day, and I am
muoh obliged for your very interesting and important evidence.
C. C. You 're quite welcome, Sir. And if anything can be done
to improve matters, it will be a real blessing to the thousands of
poor men and women and dear little children who take a run down
the River on their rare holidays. [He retires.

Our Own Commissioner. Well, Mr. Bosher, I am informed that
you can give me some information of a peculiarly interesting charac-

James Bosher. Well, yes, Sir, I think I knows a thing or two.
P'raps as muoh as most people.
Our Own C. Are you often on the River?
J. B. Yes, Sir; almost every day when the water's pretty
smooth.
Our Own C. I suppose you avoid the neighbourhood of Crossness
as much as possible?
J. B. [smiling). Oh, no, quite the contrary. I spends hours and
hours within a very short distance of it. I shouldn't go on the
River at all if it wasn't for blooming Crossness.
Our Own C. You really quite surprise me. Pray what is your
object in going there?
J. B. Business.
Our Own C. Business 1 Why, what business, in the name of all

J. B. {smiling again). Why, the fact is, Sir, I'm one of them true
Satriots who objects to anything in the shape of waste, and so I
evotes my precious time to skimming the River near Crossness of a
very valuable oil, which I afterwards, by the aid of certain chemi-
cals, convert into a certain article of daily consumption, which is
sold by the pound under the name of butt

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL [Fkbruaby 10, 1883.
JUSTICE OUT IN THE COLD.
{Or, what may be expected before Easter.)

SCENE—Interior of one of the Royal Courts just opened, during the
trial of a Civil Action. General Chorus of sneezing and cough-
ing. Sounds of hammering, and occasional alarms, alarums
and excursions, to which the Bench and Bar pay no attention,
having become acclimatised to their occurrence.
The Judge {speaking through a storm-trumpet, and interrupting a
cross-examination). Before we proceed with the further hearing of
this matter, I mast really restore the circulation to my feet by a little
more exercise. [Rises, and walks rapidly up and down the bench.
Mr. Wigblock, Q. C. {also through a storm-trumpet). If I might
make a suggestion, my Lord, I would suggest that your Lordship
would get considerable relief by adopting the course pursued by my
learned friends and myself. We are standing in foot-baths filled
with hot water.
The Judge {doubtfully). Have yon any authority for that?
Mr. Wigblock, Q.C. {handing up report). Yes, my Lord, the
Master of the Rolls, in a recent case, permitted a Counsel to appear
before him with his feet encased in a brief-bag.
The Judge. Well, then, I think I may go so far myself as to rest
my legs on a hot-bottle.
Mr. Wigblock, Q. C. As your Lordship pleases.
Foreman of the Jury {shouting in chorus). The Jury wish to say,
my Lord, that they nave been much more comfortable since they
have been supplied with a stock of warming-pans.
The Judge {bowing). I am very glad to hear it. {After consulta-
tion with sundry Officials.) I may take this opportunity of men-
tioning that I find the hot-bottle extremely valuable, and that I
have no doubt I shall be able to sit to-morrow continuously, as my
chairs and tables are to be fitted with gas-stoves.
Mr. Wigblock, Q. C. With your Lordship's permission, I will now
continue the cross-examination of the witness in the box. {Turning
to his Junior.) Kindly hold my respirator.
The Judge. I don't want to interfere with your mode of conduct-
ing this case, Mr. Wigblock, but I notice that you have taken off
the woollen comforter you have been wearing since the commence-
ment of the proceedings. Now I would put it to you—is this wise?
Mr. Wigblock, Q. C. I would submit to your Lordship that my
woollen comforter rather detracts from the dignity of my appear-
ance, and, as I feel the neoessity of impressing this Witness with
the majesty of the Law, I have thought it advisable to discard it. I
may add that I have not ventured to pursue this course until after
consultation with my learned friends associated with me in this case.
The Judge. Just so. But I may remind yon, as I have no wish to
take you by surprise, that you have already confessed to a foot-bath.
Mr. Wigblock, Q. C. Whioh is out of sight, my Lord.
The Judge. No doubt,—no doubt. But any reasonable person will
form his own deduction when he sees the Solicitor by whom you are
instructed continually handing you over cans of hot water.
Mr. Wigblock, Q.C. Certainly, my Lord, although there is no
direct evidence of what becomes of the cans, or, indeed, the hot water.
The Judge. Except your own admission. Well, I say no more.
My only wish is to assist. I have no desire to dictate to Counsel.
But I presume no objection will be raised to my wearing my cap. I
admit that it is customary only to assume it when passing a sentence
of death, but the draughts up here are bo unbearable that a head-
covering of some sort is most comforting—nay, absolutely necessary.
Mr. Wigblock, Q.C. As your Lordship observes, it is not a usual
The Judge. But as you say that the Witness requires impressing
with the majesty of the Law, it has occurred to me that my black
cap may possibly help you in creating the desired impression. I
merely throw out the suggestion.
Mr. Wigblock, Q. C. I have no wish to raise a point on a side
issue, and, consequently, I bow to your Lordship's wishes. {Turning
to Witness-Box.) And now, Sir, attend to me. During our conver-
sation you have had plenty of time to collect your thoughts. Now
then, Sir, on your oath, did you or did you not poke the fire in the
Plaintiff's presence on the occasion to whioh I have just referred?
Now, Sir,—yes or no. {A pause.) Yes or no, Sir? {A pause.) Out
with it! We must have your answer. Now then, Sir, your answer 1
Usher {after a long pause). Please, Sir, the Witness can't answer.
He's frozen to death!
The Judge. Indeed! {Briskly.) Gentlemen of the Jury, having,
I regret to say, had many cases of this kind, we have decided upon a
mode of procedure. The Court will stand adjourned until after the
inquest! [Curtain.

A NOVELTY.
The new " Photo-filigrane"
note-paper and visiting-oards,
invented by Mr. W. H. Wood-
bcht, and published by Messrs.
Brown, Bashes and Bill,
Photographers. Yon oan write
over your own portrait, art-
fully concealed within the
sheet, and only discoverable
by the uninitiated reader,
when after vainly endeavour-
ing to brush something off the
paper—he can't tell what—
and feeling that he must either
send for a doctor, or give up
everything he has been in the
habit of taking freely at once,
he holds the letter up to the
light, and finds the photograph
of the writer. It is proposed
to develope this new inven-
tion' in cheque-books, pro-
missory-notes, bills, scrip, and
debentures, which last will
always have the portrait of
the holder, and those of the
two signing Directors. It is
likely to lead to a good deal
of heartburnings and jea-
lousies, and rows generally in
private families, and may
safely be recommended to
disappointed lovers. When
you don't recognise the name
on a Fhototiligrane visiting-
card, you have only to hold
it np to the light. "Oh,
that fellow, is it r All right,
John: mind I'm not at home
when that gentleman calls!"
It has its advantages, un-
doubtedly.

A DRAMATIC TONIC.
Amongst all the fashionable
Drama-olatory—Aotor-olatoryi
and even Theatre-olatory, it is
as refreshing as a tonic to find
one body of men, however
mistaken, who boldly oppose
dramatic entertainments in
any shape, and give, as a
reason, that young men are
better without them. The
Vice-Chancellor and the Heads
of Colleges of the University
of Cambridge, are perfectly
within their legal right in
holding these opinions and
acting upon them, and the
townspeople are perfectly
within their right in opposing
the Vice-Chancellor and the
Heads of Colleges. Our own
opinion is, that the Drama,
even in its least elevated form,
is a much better amusement
for Undergraduates than many
time-honoured dissipations
that are found in every Uni-
versity City. Verbum tap.

BUMBLEDOM AGAIN.
The longer Bumbledom exists, the more wonderful it becomes,
especially at Christmas time. Its finest qualities are always brought
out by contact with "entertainments." When a liberal Theatrical
Manager offers a few hours free amusement to people who are com-
pelled to live upon the charity of ratepayers, it is not uncommon to
find the Poor-Law Guardians refusing such a gift on behalf of the
wretched creatures under their charge, and priding themselves on
their self -denial. It is so easy to refuse something whioh is given
by somebody to somebody else,—something which deprives the Stoio
of no appreciable pleasure. Much as Bumbledom has distinguished
itself in connection with firmness of this order, it has been leit for
the Guardians of a somewhat unsavoury Eastern Parish to go still
further. The Shoreditch Guardians have suddenly discovered that
all children unfortunate enough to be what is called "illegitimate"
are not entitled to witness an exhibition of dissolving views. What
lawfully-begotten idiot first hit upon this new development of Bum-
bledom, it is impossible to say, but the decision, we believe^ was
approved .of and aoted upon. In this neighbourhood of fried fish,
and cheap'olothing, a Lady has been striving for years, at great cost
and trouble, to show the world what practical charity is, and it
appears that she has taught the world, but? has not taught bnore-

grandest victory," and he continued his way across the bridge, and
reached the Amphitheatre.
"Mustn't loiter here. Sir," observed a policeman, as he noticed
the grimy horseman taking up a commanding position in the centre
of the road. "The trams have stopped running for the night, but
they will be beginning again presently."

"Why, the Battle of Waterloo. Surely they played it P"
"Played it!" replied the custodian of the law. Why,8ir, they
haven't played thai for the last twenty years or more! Why, it s
almost forgotten."
The Iron Duke uttered a moan, and galloped away.
"And this is fame!" he cried, as he crossed Blaokfriars Bridge,
and cantered down the Embankment. "This is fame! .Even

Tou cannot imagine how dull Brurel and I find it watching the

First Gentleman of Europe. "Very pleased to see you. We wanted
another equestrian statue to balance mine. Gad, Sir, what could
make a better pair than the Kiog and the Duke—the two Heroes of

"Sorry I must bid adieu to your Majesty. I am weary, and am
anxious to get to rest. One hideous monument is sufficient, without
the addition of another!"
And with this the Statue onoe more entered Piccadilly, and sor-
rowfully rode to Hyde Park.
"There is no fit resting-place for me anywhere!" be murmured
mournfully. "Where shall I hide myself r When shall I shake off

than half a century ago P Ah, a happy thought strikes me! Yes.
it shall be done! Ana at onoe! Good night, Apsley House I Good

Saying this, the Duke took a plunge, and sank to rest for

"It is with more than usual satisfaction I again invite your

in your absence things have been going along pretty smoothly.
Indeed, I sometimes think of recurring to the example of some of
my ancestors of the Flantagenet line, and giving you a few

"You, in particular, are inclined to be meddlesome, poking
your honourable nose into all kinds of things, worrying our truBty

untimeously elevating the collar of our immaculate "William. A
pretty mess you would have made of the Egyptian Question, supposing

it nicely and quietly, got our own way in everything, shown Europe
that we are Diplomatists as well as soldiers, and raised the prestige of
England to a point at which it has not stood since the days of Pitt.
You are all very well in your way, especially when money is
wanted—and, by the way, I may here mention that the Estimates for
the service of the year are in an advanced state of preparation, and
will be promptly submitted, to you—but what with your inconve-
nient questions, your party manoeuvres, your intervention, and your
non-intervention, your sentimentality and impracticability, your
habit, in short, of playing to the Gallery, you are sometimes best
away. As Lord Braconsfield used to say,'Parliamentary Govern-
ment would he impossible but for the Recess.'
"My Lords and Gentlemen,
"I trust we shall not have any time wasted this Session by
conflicts between your two Hon. Houses. There was a good deal too
much of this last year. "We all mean business this Session, and I
look forward to the opportunity, early in August, of congratulating
you upon the amount of useful work accomplished. Both at
home and abroad affairs are in a condition which leave you time to
mind your own business. "Whilst we were prancing abroad, getting
up wars, little and big, and at home were misgoverning Ire-
land, my people in England, Scotland, and "Wales have been
woefully neglected. Now that all the running accounts of our
spirited Foreign Policy in Europe, Asia, and Africa are happily
olosed, and when Ireland is in a more settled condition than it has
been for six years, let us give the other parts of my Empire a turn.
Bend your lofty souls to the Bankruptcy Bill. Curb your boundless
aspirations to the level of the Corporation of London Bill, the Con-
solidation of the Criminal Code, the Repression of Corrupt Practices
at Elections, the Conservancy of Rivers, and the Prevention of
Floods. In brief, talk less and do more, and so shall your wisdom
and energy prove equal to the varied and increasing needs of this
extended Empire."
Thought Lord Selbornb's emotion would have choked him.
Scarcely a dry eye in the assembly when he finished. Then all away
to come back at four o'clock, and see the revival of the favourite
Westminster piece, Pat de Deux; or, The Mace, the Speaker, and
the Bounding Srothert.

"WAITING AN ANSWER.
A "Justice of the Peace" complained the other day in the
columns of a contemporary that the use of the honoured affix,
"J. P.," was not solely restricted, as it ought to be, to the magnates
of his own order, to wit, the County Magistrates " chosen from the
chief landowners and men of position in the county," but was borne
equally by " Brown, Jones, and Robinson, small shopkeepers, with
jurisdiction in their own small borough only." Let suoh small fry,
adds the indignant County Justice, "be satisfied by being called
'Justices of the Borough, or 'J.B.'" Mr. Punch is not in the
habit of troubling himself with the petty squabbles of puny people,
but as the rather too often repeated phrase "Justices' Justioe."
occurs to him, he confesses to being struck with a certain stolid
robustness about the intelligence of this particular J.P. He had
always been under the impression that some of the worst decisions
in the three kingdoms invariably emanated from provincial benches
graced not by Brown, Jones, and Robinson, the small shopkeepers
of the borough, but by the very bigwigs, "the chief landowners and
men of position in the County," to whom the J.P. in question (who
might also sign himself S.N.O.B.) so proudly refers.
By the way, did not the unhappy woman sent up only last week,
in a dying condition, from Guildford to Westminster,—and of whose
case—for it was a terrible and Borry one—Mr. Punch hopes he has
not yet heard the last,—receive her gentle sentence of three months'
hard labour for the heinous offence of sleeping in an outhouse, from
one of these same rural Solomons? If so, the less for the moment
the public hear about such worthies in a vaunting key, the better.
Anyhow, Mr. Punch puts the question; and, in the interests not
only of peace and justice, but of common humanity, if there is any
satisfactory reply to it forthcoming that will clear the fair fame of
a J.P. or of anybody else, he will be mightily glad to hear it. Mr.
Punch waits an answer.
POETICAL LICENCES.
"We understand that a new feature will shortly be added to the
Inland Revenue by the introduction of a Poetical Licence tax. By
a curious coincidence, which is only an additional proof of the great-
ness of our nation and the readiness with which the people of these
islands resent any interference with their liberties, attention of the
Government has been drawn simultaneously from all quarters of
Britain to the extraordinary extravagance and waste which has been
permitted in the human mind by the reproduction, annually, of
what is known as the "rhetoric of the recess," and the increasing
exuberance of volumes of poetry and sermons by budding poets and
country clergymen. The new licence, unlike those for dogs and
guns, will vary according to the requirements of the applicant.
Country residents will be supplied at the local post-offices; the post-
master to decide whether the application shall be granted or not. It
is expected that the new measure will be largely taken advantage of
by the Editors of the leading London journals.
"Ready, aye Ready !"—Mr. Punch begs to acknowledge the
receipt of a Five-pound Note from " A Constant Subscriber,"" in
fenerous response to the Life-Boat verses in last week's number,
he donation has been forwarded to the National Life-Boat Fund.
* "What does this signature meanP "A Constant Subscriber" of Fire-
pound Notes P How nice!
'WHAT WILL HE DO WITH HIM?"

AN ADVERTISING SUGGESTION.
The ingenuity of most Theatrical Managers in discovering new ways of
recommending their productions to the Public being nearly exhausted, it has
ooourred to us that the good old form first used, we believe, by Professor Hollo-
way, might be revived with advantage. The clerical certificate has been tried
with success, and there is no reason why a form of approval such as used to
be signed by the " Earl of Aldborough " should not help to fill the overgor^ed
advertising columns of the daily press. We give a few skeleton forms which
can be filled up according to the taste and enterprise of the Managers:—
For a Burlesque-House.
"I have now witnessed your invaluable Burlesques for several years, and
I fearlessly pronounce them to be the best life-regenerators ever produced. My
wife, who has witnessed them with me on several occasions, joins me in this
testimony."
For a Drama-House.
"Tour powerful and moral Dramas have converted me from a drunkard
and a thief into a respectable member of Society. I have left off kicking my
wife, and I have not assaulted the Police, or pawned anything illegally for
four years. This is written for me by a member of the .School Board, as
unfortunately my education has been neglected."
For a Comedy-House.
"I cannot find words to express my gratitude for your refined and refining
entertainment. Before I attended your Theatre regularly, I suffered very
Much from nervousness and neuralgia, but both these afflictions are now
thoroughly cured. You can make any use you like of this testimonial."
Foe a Pantomime-House.
"Remarkable Case of Longevity.—Matthew Slurr (supposed to be a corrup-
tion of Methuselah) now a resident of the Asylum for Decayed Cheesemongers,
completed his one hundred and tenth year, last Thursday. He remembers the
original production of Mother Goose with 0himaldi. Has no hesitation in saying
that the old Pantomimes were not a patch upon the new ones."

The Ins and Outs from rest are back,
The Speaker 's in his chair.
The talk-mill now resumes its clack,
As birds begin to pair.

Wit's bow is strung to slay.
Uprouse ye then, my merry, merry men,
It is our op'ning day I
Chorus—Uprouse ye then, &o.
Both Whigs and Bads are wide awake,
Unclosed are Tory's eyes j
The morning papers now will make
Less room for fads and lies.
Bewilder'd Cits through columns ten
Onoe more will plod their way;
Uprouse ye then, my merry, merry men,
It is our op'ning day.
Chorus—Uprouse ye then, &o.
The Cloture's power own we now
To silence faction's jaw;
Pat shall not raise eternal row,
In spite of taste and law.
Home-legislation looms in ken,
England shall have her day.
Uprouse ye then, my merry, merry men,
And use it as ye may!
Chorus :—
Uprouse ye then, my merry, merry men!
Uprouse ye then, I say!
Fill up your horns, and let the glen
Resound with echoes gay!

Big game we '11 bring to bay.
Uprouse ye then,
My merry, merry men,

MUNICIPALITY REFORM A LORD NIQHT-MAYORISH DREAM OF THE FUTURE.
"THE NOTE OF BUSY PREPARATION."
The Corporation of the City of London having resolved, appa-
rently, to make a good fight for those priceless privileges they have
so long enjoyed, and some of which, to their credit be it saia, they
have at all times been ready to share, not only with the celebrities
of the whole Metropolis, but with any distinguished Potentate who
has visited our shores, such as the Sultan of Tttbxxt and the Shah
of Pkbsia. have appointed a Special Committee to whom they have
referred the whole distasteful subject of Reform, and the Committee,
doubtless after due deliberation, have selected as their chief, that
doughty champion of true Conservatism, Sir Fbakcis Wtatt Tbus-
cott, Knight and Alderman.'
We understand that the campaign
will be opened, contemporaneously with the opening of Parliament,
with a series of those brilliant festivals, dedicated to the Genius ot
Civio Hospitality, that have on so many previous occasions enabled
them to send away their bitterest foes softened and subdued.
"Wit and food-humour sparkled like the wine,
And Bada who came U icoff remained to dine."
There being probably but one Institution in the whole civilised
world that delights in bringing together all that is high and noble

Thou art right welcome. Sit thee down, Will. (Shakspeare sits.)
And now, how doth business at the Globe? How goeth our Hamlet?

Bacon, It pleases me well. Talk of your Ohost, doth the Ohost

Shakspeare. Punctually, my Lord, in good sooth, every Saturday

Bacon. Good. I will therefore thank thee to hand me oyer the

Shakspeare. I shall, my Lord, incontinently. Meanwhile, so
Slease your Lordship, I must beoome yet further your Lordship's
ebtor for the wealth, I mean the workmanship, of your wit. My
Lord, Her Majesty the Queen did last night come to see Henry the
Fourth. After the play she called me to her presence, and did
declare her pleasure that I should produce her apiece with a part for
Falstaff, and therein present Falstaff m love.
Bacon. How didst thou answer her?
Shakspeare. In your Lordship's own words—" I shall in all my

"Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply."

inconceivable suggestion and unimaginable fancy of Her Most
Gracious Majesty's, in respect both of love and of Falstaff.
Shakspeare. But how, then, my Lord, may we in anywise manage
to perform her Royal command P
Bacon. About my brains! Methinks I seem to spy some glimmer
of a way. A gross fat man fallen into the conceit that some fair
dame is enamoured of him, lured on to make love to her after his
own fashion. Falstaff in love c'y pres, as we say at Westminster.
Shakspeare. That would serve, my Lord.
Bacon. Falstaff thereto befooled, moreover, by the contrivance of
some merry women. Merry P Ha! So! Why, certainly it seems
to myself that all this hath passed through my mind before—as we
do sometimes feel. I must have dreamt of writing such a play.
Methinks I even recollect the name on't. Merry I Yea, marry,

Shakspeare, A title passing good, my Lord, and a taking. Truly,
a happy thought—Let me pray your Lordship about it presently.
Bacon. Marry and shall, with all the expedition I may. As soon
as possible, I '11 send it to thy playhouse.
Shakspeare. A thousand thanks, my Lord.
Bacon. In the meanwhile, I prithee forget not that small balance.
Shakspeare. Trust me, my Lord.
Bacon. Needs must I until thou render me the needful.
Shakspeare. Your Lordship shall be straightway satisfied. I
humbly take my leave. [Exit Shakspeare.
Bacon. There goeth honest Will, the reputed Author of the
greatest works in their kind the world hath ever seen. But to
acknowledge myself a writer of stage-plays would not now sort with
my dignity, nor exactly serve my turn. Their excellences also are,
for the time being, too far above popular valuation to make it worth
while. And what doth it signify P For Posterity will sooner or
later be sure to discover that my plays could not possibly have been
written by any of my contemporaries, or anybody else whomsoever
in any age or country, of abilities inferior to my own. Suffice it for
the present that I do make a little money of them, by means of my
faotor, Will Shakspeare. [Curtain.

My Indian bracelet, in enamelled gold, representing a two-headed serpent, and
enriched with rose-diamonds and rubies, given by the Prince— our Prince—the
only Monseigneur of all our many seigneurs who appreciates Qenius, Art, and
Beauty. All necessity for printing this Catalogue at all would have been obviated
if I had addressed myself directly to the donor of this interesting lot. But Art
has its pride as well as its little presents, and Pama la's dignity would never
have survived it.
My Gold Comb, representing a trophy of Comedy and Tragedy, and bearing
my own proud device— Quand Meme—which I shall now write: Quand m'aimes,
fais-moi des cadeaux. This lot really represents for anybody with a soul under
his waistcoat an allegorical souvenir of Art and Literature united more or less
fraternally, given to me by Emile de Girardln in return for my bust of him—
there's a historical memento for you 1 With a decent auctioneer possessing the
slightest sense of the picturesque it ought to go like Fidora, Picture the great
Emile, who sat upon everybody else, sitting to the sublime Sarah! Why, there's

will throw in, if they like, a few recollections of how Km ilk. would say—but I
mustn't put them in the Catalogue, because they wouldn't fetch anything if
already published.
My set of Mormon Spoons and Forks. This ought to be regarded as a kind of
half-humorous, half-serio-theological memory of Me. I remember the dis-
reputable old Elder who gave them Me after that famous performance at Brigham
Young's theatre of the evergreen (particularly in the dying scene) Dame aux
Camilias. How all the wives cried! You could not see a husband for the clouds
of pocket-handkerchiefs. They had been weeping over our wicked Parisian
polyandry, the Elder said, entertaining Marie Colohbier and Me at supper
afterwards—in order to etrenner the forks and spoons. It need not be added that
the forks were found to be in perfidious Bohemia metal,
and that the only real spoons were those evinced by the
perfidious Elder.
My Italian tributes from Queen Margharita and
the Duke d'Aosta: This lot should be considered in
the light of a peace offering from Italy to France.
Italy hadn't been behaving very well to France for
some years, and I went there purely on a patriotic mis-
sion. Therefore I think this tribute of amicable feeling
ought to be bought up (as high as possible) by the State,
and kept in the Louvre alongside the Marie Antoinette
and Napoleon relios. The Duke formally told me, after
the Second Act of Hernani, that they had no intentions
with regard to Nice; and the Queen was quite civil
in her inquiries about Monsieur Grevt. And I could
throw a Treaty offensive and defensive in, if it were
worth my while.
My Servioe of Gold Plate for Crowned Heads: This
would admirably suit a Lord Mayor, low comedian, or
successful pawnbroker. The sovereigns who have deigned
to eat off it all left their marks—in the shape of pre-
sents whioh would defray its cost three times over.
My Silver Service for every day, I think we shall buy
in. Dam Ala says he can't resign himself to pottery;
and, as for Maurice, he is like Louis the Fourteenth,
when he pawned the Crown plate; he says our only
resource is SeYres for the table, and old Rouen for the
kitchen.
My Talisman, given by my godmother, whose name
1 forget. This lot I have decided to withdraw. People
wouldn't understand. It is of no great use to anyone
save the owner. It is a very small amulet, in the shape
of a superb Cheek. My other amulet, chic, isn't worth
half as much.
THE HAT THAT BRAVED!

Mr. Gladstone has presented the tall hat and high collars
which he wore at the Carnival (Feb. 6) to the Museum of

LEGAL DELIGHTS.
The man who has never been a Defendant in an action -
at-law has never tasted one of the chief pleasures of
existence. He is probably served with a writ, and his
servants, and perhaps his wife, begin to suspect that he
is connected in some mysterious way with the Dynamite
Brotherhood. He goes to a Solicitor, and, after several
days of patient teaching, he will have taught that
Solicitor something about his case. In due time the
Solicitor will take the same trouble, second-hand, to
teach a Barrister; after which the Barrister—if the case
goes into Court—will take the trouble, third-hand, if he
is not oalled into another Court, to teach the Judge;
and the Judge, fourth-hand, will take the trouble to
teach the Jury.
The man, now called a Client, will be asked, in
writing, the most insulting questions called " interroga-
tories, and these he will be expected to answer, without
losing his temper. Various legal messengers will now
wait upon him at various hours of the day to swear
various affidavits. He will be asked to step out and find
a Commissioner empowered to take Oaths, and after
trying two ground-floors and three first-floors, will dis-
cover one of these privileged persons in an airy garret.
He will now learn the meaning and beauty of the word
venue.
He may be sued in Yokelshire, or he may be Bued in
Clogshire. In the latter case he will be marched down
to Mudohester with his Solicitor and a small party of
witnesses—the majority of whom will never be wanted.
He will be fed with reports that he is Number Four on
the list, and may come on at any moment. After waiting
a week, he will find that Mudohester has more cases than
it can try, and he is marched off with his party to the
neighbouring town of Livelypool. Here he is comforted
with the assurance that he will " come on" at the open-
ing of the Assizes, and, in consequence, he has only to
wait four days for his long-expected trial.
His case is sure to be one that can only be properly
judged without favour or prejudice by a London Jury,
but, if the venue is laid in Clogshire, he must be tried by
the natives. He finds his Solicitor and Barristers sitting
in cramped pews, with huge bundles of papers before
them the size of hotel-pillows. These papers seem to
make them very unhappy, but still they oling to them.
Being about the longest documents in existence they are
called "briefs," ana do not appear necessary to any
person who can write the history of England on a shirt-
cuff. The Barristers get tired of these unwieldy docu-
ments before the trial is half over, and are thankful to
anyone—even to the "Client"—who will give them
information that can be put upon a railway-ticket.
The case will probably be ably argued on both sides,
without temper or bad taste—for the Northern Circuit is
served by leading lawyers and Judges—but the Jury will
doubtless take their own view in spite of evidence and
ruling. The Client will have the pleasure of obtaining
a new trial in London, if he likes to apply for it, and if
not, he will have learnt something for his money.
"The best thing for breakfast," says Mrs. Rams-
botham, "is a nice Fenian Hammock or a Skipper on
Toast."

"BUMBLEDOM AGAIN"
ON-CE MOKE.
Last week under this head we
remarked that "the Shoreditch
Guardians had suddenly dis-
covered that all children unfor-
tunate enough to be what is
called ' illegitimate' are not en-
titled to witness an exhibition of
Dissolving Views," and, we added,
"the decision, we believe , was
approved of and acted upon."
We have since been officially
informed by Mr. Clay—we do
not mention his name for the
sake of " puffing our clay "—the
Clerk to the Guardians in ques-
tion, that our belief as to the
decision was erroneous, and that
the decision itself was that " the
able-bodied male inmates and
the mothers of illegitimate chil-
dren were to be excluded" from
the entertainment of Dissolving
Views, and so concerning the
whole matter we are glad to say
that our own views have been
entirely dissolved. It only re-
mains to suggest that the next
time the Shoreditch Guardians
give an entertainment it should
be a good play belonging to the
Legitimate Drama.

If this establishment _ is "so

where it is? If a witness went to
sleep there under the impression
that it was close to the New

A WAIL FROM THE CITY.
Farewell to big dinners and soup of the turtle,
Which shows how we feed in Britannia's clime;
The enemy's arrows around us now hurtle,
Then why not reform when perchance there is time.
We've revelled too long upon port and madeira,
Too often have sipped the insidious punch;
But now comes the dawn of a terrible era,
When we mayn't get even gratuitous lunch.
How nobly we've struggled through excellent dinners,
Involving, perchance, the persuasive blue pill;
Why single us out then as specially sinners,
When crowned heads have dined with us, eating their fill?
But certain it is that the whole British nation
Must fall—if we fall—that the City will swear;
Pull down if you like then the great Corporation,
And England will vanish like bubbles in air!

Clerk, " I won't be bullied, Sir, and I tell you that if you take it to

you '11 alter your tone."
"I shall only alter my tone," was the reply, "if I change my

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

PARLIAMENTARY CBES3 TOURNAMENT WITH
FIGURES.
LIVING
Hovss of Common!, Thursday, February 15.—"If there's one
thing in this world that's worse than Bradlat/gh it's mock-turtle."
It was the voice of the Alderman whom I heard thus complain.
He was standing near me at Bar in House of Lords: temper a little
soured, having Seen elbowed out of the front row by some Radical
Members who have no respect for Corporations, whether they be of
the City of London or merely of Aldermen.
"Turtle's something like," the Alderman continued, and the
expression of his face softened, his eye lost its glamour, and his
tongue gently caressed his lips. "But, if we can't have it, let's do
without soup."
Found out presently that this Aldermanio parable was intended to
express dissatisfaction with the performance of opening Parliament
by Royal Commission. Rather Radical sentiments for the Alderman.
Otherwise seems to be right. Funny to see for the first time the
five Royal Commissioners in their butterwoman's cloaks, with cocked
hats which, at a signal from another Gentleman in black wig
and gown who bobs up and down before them, they lift and replace.
But not the sort of thing you care to see often. Wouldn't get fifty
nights' run on any other stage. Mr. Holder, the young Member
for the West Riding, is full of new idea as to how it might be done.
Great mechanical genius, Holder. Invented the stocking-loom, or
the sewing-machine, or something of the kind.
"Why not," says he, "have Marionettes done up like Lords Com-
missioners? Could easily work in the Clerks at the Table; have a
barrel-organ to play 'Should auld acquaintance be forgot,' and
there you are. Nothing like machinery for saving time ana labour."
Seems good idea: worth thinking of when House of Lords come to
reform their procedure.
House looked a little better at four o'clock when Peers came down,
and tho battle of the Address commenced. Princess of Wales in
the Gallery looking a little pale in her mourning. Prince of Walks
on the Cross Benches, looking jollier than ever. Brought baok some
good stories about the Grand Old Man at the Carnival, and other
dissipations of the Riviera. Told a few to Gsakvtlle and
myself in the Robing Room. Lord Wolselkt took the Oath
and his seat for Cairo. Afterwards sat on Cross Benches between
Prince of Wales and the great soldier who planned Egyptian
Campaign. Looked critically on first Parliamentary encounter.
"Not muoh to you after Tel-el-Kebir," H.R.H. said, pleasantly.
"No, Sir," replied our only General. "I'm getting tired of sham
fights."
In House of Commons at four o'clock great crowd, and sup-
Eressed excitement. Outside, people risen in their thousands, and
aving games with the police. First they fill up one part of the
roadway, and policeman on curvetting white steed baoks into them.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
Spaoe cleared here filled up in another place ten yards higher up.
Another polioeman on bounding bay backs into them. They return
to old stand, and curvetting white steed has another walk round.
This is what the police call "passing away." It passes away the
time pleasantly enough, till Mr. Bradlaugh appears in Hansom
cab. Murmurs of disappointment among the throng. B. had intro-
duced himself as " your General for the day." Thought he would
appear in a chariot, in scarlet coat, sash, and plumed hat, like the
City Marshal. Hansom cab, chimney-pot hat, black coat, and no
other weapon about him than probably a stylographic pen concealed
in breast pocket, naturally lowered enthusiasm of mob. Fortunately
white steed and. bounding bay began again, and arrested deep
depression stealing o'er them.
Inside, much same sort of thing. Sergeant-at-arms drawn on
pair of white kid gloves (two buttons), also new pumps. Floor
waxed, and everything ready for the giddy dance. But after Lord
Habtington, in reply to question, said Parliamentary Oaths Bill
would be brought in, Mr. Bradlaugh went out.
After this Irish Members fell quite flat. "Never knew anything
like the luok of those fellows," Mr. Christopher Sykes drawled,
surveying them through his eye-glass, as if they were oocupants of
a monkey-house. "Always got one of their number in prison.
Believe they draw lots who's to be put in gaol, so that the others
may oome down here and make a row."
It's Healy happens to be out of luck this time. Yet should have
thought there needn't have been all this bother. Remember when
He alt declared he " didn't care two rows of pins whether he was
in prison or the House of Commons." House has a preference on the
subject. If it can be gratified without individual suffering, why
not P Put it this way to Pabnell, who says that may be all very
well in social life, but in politics things are different.
"But you usedn't to be so desperately fond of Tim when he was
here," I urge.
"No," says Pa knell, in his soft sad voice; "but you know
absence makes the heart grow fonder."
A military tread, the clank of a sword, the smell of gunpowder.
"Adown the glen march armed men." Look round and behold a
terrible figure at the end of the corridor near the ante-room where
peaoeful Members enter to seoure places for mothers and wives in
the Ladies' Gallery. Thought at first it was the Duke of Welling-
ton coming to enter protest against his disestablishment. Like
him about the plumed cap, but figure not quite so tall. As it came
nearer by forced marches, discovered it was only Dyke Acland.
"What, in Heaven's name, 's the matter P" I asked, when breath
came back. "Are the Reserves called out? Have the French
landed? Or is it the mob that's broken through Palace Yard P"
"No," said the Colonel. "Don't you know I'm going to move
the Address P"
"Now, General, look here!" I said, my blood boiling. "I'm a
general supporter of this Ministry. I think Gladstone the Grandest
Old Man of this or any age. But I 'm sick of this systematic Coer-
cion. Outside you make the British Public1 pass away' at the horses'
hoof, and inside you move the Address at the point of the sword.
I '11 join Wilfrid Lawson, Labouchebb, ana Henby Richard,
and you see if the Fifth Party won't be worse than the Fourth."
"Nonsense," said the Commander-in-Chief; "you don't under-
stand. It's merely a matter of form; horribly uncomfortable for us;
but if Address not moved by Gentleman in Military Uniform what
would become of British Constitution?"
"That's all right, Corporal. Perhaps I don't understand. There's
many things I don't understand in this House. But what do you
mean by marching and counter-marching in remote corridors, start-
ling Hon. Members P"
Fact is, Toby," said the Quartermaster-General, lowering his
voice, "it's a little hard to walk in these things, when you're not
used to them. If this leather reticule at the end of the strap doesn't
get between your legs, the sword will. Between the two my life's a
burden. General Bubnaby was good enough to give me half-an-
hour's drill. But you can't learn to walk like a turkey-cock in half-
an-hour. Quite sure I '11 come to grief with the sword, going into
the House, and with the reticule going out, or the other way about.
I'm sure I don't care which it is.
The gallant Major, however, managed very well when the time
came. Walk a little stiff, and face a little pale. But got safely to
his seat, and back again.
Altogether, sitting very dull. Same thing here as Wolseley's
eagle eye discovered in another place. Only sham fight, and not
very brilliantly carried on. House further depressed by dejected
a ] ppearunce of Mr. Bigqab. Whatever may have been weighing on his
mind is evidently growing more oppressive; the light faded from
his eye, the bloom from his cheek, the gaiety from his heart.
"Come, come, Joseph!" I said to him, "this will never do.
Things don't mend by knocking under. Besides, they mayn't be so
bad. Caine tells me he means to push forward his Bill. If your
fellows don't obstruct, it might easily be got through by Easter.
Couldn't you manage it with them P"
"No," Joey B. answered in husky voice, and with manner no
longer sly, "I saw what could be done as soon as Caink gave notice
of his Bill. Went on my knees to Pabnell. Says he can't inter-
fere. Dick Poweb told me, confidentially, Wabton means to block
the Bill. Too late. Toby, too late!" And Joseph wiped away a
tear with the cuff of his coat-sleeve. Business done.—Address moved.
"'Saturday Morning.—Peteb burned his boats and crossed the
Rubioon, as Pabnell once said the Government had dene. More
convenient to cross first, and burn boats afterwards. But that's a
trifle. Childers has come baok, looking quite ruddy; evidently
good for the Chancellorship of the Exchequer as long as this Parlia-
ment lasts. But if the Ministry won't have Peter one way, they
shall another. So last night gave notice that "on early ocoasion
will call attention to the present state of the National Expenditure,
and move a Resolution." Uproarious cheering from Conservative
benches. Odds rapidly falling against Peteb some day joining
Fourth Party.
This morning Bradlaugh conflagration unexpectedly broke out on
Motion to bring in Bill. Struggle lasted two nours—a "small and
early." No dancing. Business done.—Address moved.
KNOW YE THE LAND?
{A CUy Song.)
"From facts just published, it appears that New York furnishes the chief
market for that Aldermanic luxury, the turtle. The City receives every year
from 150,000 to 180,001b. Turtles are most plentiful during the summer, and
when the supply is larger than the demand, the turtles are kept aSoat, and
given cabbages, lettuce, celery tops, and water-melon rinds, the last-named
article of diet being the most highly prized."
E!now ye the land where the high price of turtle
Tacks on to your dinner as muoh as the wine;
Where you big Civio swells would with Cyprus and myrtle
Sit orowned in despair—asked without it to dine?
The land, where to-day simple oysters and porter
Are counted fit lunch for a millionnaire;
Where, stock of the real run shorter and shorter,
The mock takes its place with a confident air?
Ah, know ye the land where, when " green fat" abounded,
Three helpings you held nothing out of the way;
Where now, by the calf that deceives quite dumbfounded,
Untasted you send your one portion away?
Ah, well! if ye know such a land, and are frantic
To think that it boasts scarce an honest tureen;
Take courage: there's hope yet beyond the Atlantic
On shores where the fat that you love is still green!
Where the cook whom ye trust doesn't prove but a traitor,
And the turtle is kept in condition that's fine;
Supply than demand being delightfully greater,
And. all but the spirit of man is divine!
So pluck up your courage; your turtle awaits you,
On cabbage and lettuce enjoying his ease;
And if fierce Reform with economy baits you,
Pack up: seek three helpings beyond the green seas I

PLON-PLON IN ENGLAND.
{A Fragment from an Autobiography.)
9 a.m.—Reached Charing Cross more dead than alive. Gave Louis
his breakfast, who has consented to accompany me on condition of
receiving a week's holiday, a youth's chemical chest, and a popgun.
He insisted upon having breakfast. The passage seems to nave
agreed with him. He apparently spent his time on board in attempt-
ing to drop my luggage into the engines. "Was too ill to look after
him. Made for Leicester Square.
10 a.m.—Have finished my dejeuner at the Hotel de Paris et let
deux Mondet. Absinthe wretched! Took a sardine with my rosbif,
biftek, and cotelettes in honour of Lent. Shall mention this to
Euo£nie when I see her later. Louis finished the cognac when I
was not looking, and consequently is as incapable as his brother
Victor to oust me, or to do anything else.
11 a.m.—Having dropped Louis into the Leicester Square foun-
tains, he has revived. Visited Madame Tussaud's Wax-Works.
Much annoyed at finding no " Portrait Model" of myself. Pointed
out that as my Uncle was represented as reclining on a tent bed-
stead, his duplicate effigy in the centre of the Imperial group might
do for me—with a fair amount of stuffing. Louis suggested that I
might be put in the Chamber of Horrors. Very much annoyed, and
would have publicly thrashed him had he not threatened me with
his Uncle Humbert in Rome. The boys (ungrateful little mites 1J
are always trying to get up a family quarrel. Half a mind to send
them back to Clotilde. They are not a bit of use to me—rather
the reverse.
12 Noon.—Called at Marlborough House. The family out of town.
Gave my name at the gate, and was informed that the Prince had
left word if I called that "he was indisposed." "To Bee you!"
shouted Louis, who is a vulgar little fellow for a king's grandson.
Much annoyed. Took an omnibus to the Waterloo Station, and
quarrelled about the fare. Having to wait for a train, looked up a
local bill-poster, and find that I can get a Manifesto issued much
cheaper in London than in Paris. Made a note of this. Advertise-
ment Agent very intelligent. On learning my name and purpose,
suggested that 1 should use some old posters of the " Battle of
Waterloo" he had in stock. He said I could have the block altered
so as to appear myself as the Duke, whose nose had disappeared in
the course of wear and tear. Thought that if I could secure the
services of a dozen regiments just to back him up, he might " make
a good job of it." Was obliged to refuse, as his terms are "fixed
prices—payment in advance."
1 p.m.—Took a train to Farnborough. Very pleased with the military
display. Quite reminded me of my old Crimean days. Much nicer,
too—no danger. Sentry saluted me. Delighted. Louis roared with
laughter, and told the man that he had made a mistake—"That I
was not a soldier." Chased the young rascal with my umbrella
until I was forced to desist from want of breath. I am not so slim
as I used to be. Never mind 1 When I get baok to the throne and
my relatives, Master Louis shall have a oouple of years or so in the
Conoiergerie! I will teach him to be rude to his father!
2 p.m.—Eugenie has very oivilly Bent a carriage for me. Hurried
to see her. She says she does not know why I have come. Explain
it's a return visit. "So kind of her to have looked me up in Paris."
She says that she did nothing of the sort—she came to see Mathilde,
not me I She is generally nasty, and says she won't have her name
"dragged into my ridiculous fiascos." Grieved, as I hoped to have
induced her to pay at least a part of the Manifesto printing-bill.
3 p.m.—Found that the carriage in which I came had returned to
the stables. Suppose the coachman wouldn't wait because I hadn't
tipped him. Very well I I will pay off old scores when I get back!
Had to carry Louis all the way back to the station, as the ungrateful
little wretch threatened to give me into custody if I didn't. He says
that two of the umbrellas I have now in my possession came from
the house I have just visited! Told him that he was too young to
understand these matters, and that I had a perfeot right to "requi-
sition" anything I liked.
4 p.m.—Back in London. Called at the Zoological Gardens, and
visited the Eagles. Asked the price of one of the smallest, with a
view to making a descent upon Boulogne. Pound them much too
dear. Said they would let me have a vulture cheap, which would do
just as well if 1 concealed the bird's neck with a large tricolor rosette.
Said. I would think it over. If I came at night, an old fowl with a
Roman-nosed beak would answer all my purposes. Obliged to be
economical. Borrowed, privately, a Napolen Louis had received
from his mother. He was very muoh annoyed on discovering his
loss. Must, however, be businesslike and economical.
5. p.m.—Louis, having discovered that I had annexed his money,
set up a yell. To quiet him, promised to show him all "the monu-
ments" of London. Visited consequently the South Kensington
Museum, the National Gallery, and the Albert Memorial. Really
very interesting, and not expensive. Mislaid my son in Kensington
Gardens, and. dined at the Holborn Restaurant admirably.
6 p.m.—Feel very much better. Saw my name in large letters in
the contents bills of the Evening papers. Nerved myself for to-
morrow's Channel martyrdom with unlimited absinthe. Everything
couleur de rose!
7 p.m.—Can't find Louis anywhere! Made acquaintance with a
lamp-post! Don't care! Beast of a boy! Can't say French Con-
stitution! Never could!
8 p.m.—Just assured a couple of policemen that " it's all right!"
9 p.m.—Have been accommodated with a cell. Going to bed—in
my Uncle's boots!
And Quite Right Too I—After all, the Municipality of Geneva
is only following the principle of many of our country towns—
namely, not to allow Booths in the street save in fair time. But the
Salvationists say it evidently isn't a fair time at Geneva.

FORCIBLE.
'Sburk, Sib, he ought to be hum, it he 'd as manny Lives as
Plutab-sob I"
Born, May 22, 1813. Died, February 13, 1883.
In Musio-World arch-revolutionist,
Titan-assailant of its elder gods,
For him the menace of the Jovian nods,
The thunders and the rock-storm. Yet he kist
With climbing orest the empyrean's crown,!
Out-nodding old Olympus in his mood
Of most aggressive mastery. Of the brood
Of Demiurgus militant, whose frown.
Like that of mailed Mars amidst the boys,
Frightens away Convention's chirrupers.
And to wild cackle as of goose-flights stirs
Pale Peace's pretty iluters of small joys
And fine factitious sorrows. Then what wonder
He brought the sword into mild Music's sphere,
And in the clangour of the hurtling spear,
The clashing mail, and the loud battle-thunder,
Missed, sometime, of the finer harmony
The still small voice, known of the subtler ear,
Which outlives all War's clarions? Year on year
May pass ere he is measured. Yet we see
The work of a strong shaper, one whose part
Was with new light to show a newer way.
He stripped the gewgaw'd shams of Opera,
Lord of two spheres, he wedded Art with Art,
And Music, sunned in brighter, larger fame,
May date its nobler dawn from Wagneb's migzuy

Purse-onal Attractions.
We cull the following from the Sussex Daily News:—
ADVERTISER (Widower) seeks a Christian Pabtner
(domesticated) willing to invest capital in profitable business,
and property under her own control, with a view to matrimony.
—Address, by letter only.
The Advertiser evidently wishes to, to quote the Era,
"combine leading business with general utility." He
wants a Christian, a commercial, and a matrimonial
partner all in one. "Domesticated," however, sounds
like the attribute of a cat.
ANOTHER LITTLE HOLIDAY.
Introductory Preface, showing how it was done—Digression on
Johnnies—Inspiration—Extract from Pocket-Book Notes—
Off, off!
My Doctor is always telling me to " Go away!" Though undoubt-
edly excellent advice, yet when it comes to be written down in,
literally, the two words, "Go away," it looks like the pettish ex-
pression of a schoolboy who is being teased, or of a girl who doesn't
want to be bothered. Perhaps my Doctor is being teased, and
doesn't want to be bothered, and that is why he says, "0 go away I"
Curiously enough, I have often noticed that whenever he has told
me to " go away " he has generally " gone away" himself. "Gone
away " is suggestive of a fox; but Heaven forbid I should, for one
moment, insist on such a comparison. All I wish to record is that
my Doctor told me to "go away;" that he enforced his precept by
practice,—he has an excellent practice,—and that, while in doubt, I
happened to fall in with young Willie Wadd, wno was introduced
to me as one of the set of " Johnnies " whose acquaintance I had the
great pleasure of making last autumn in Wales.
By the way, before continuing the main subject of these Notes, I
cannot resist this opportunity of remarking on the universally
growing tendency to speak of everyone by a Christian name,—it may
or may not be his own Christian name as given him by his god-
fathers and godmothers, but whether it is or isn't depends entirely
upon the fact of the sponsors having selected a good one for conver-
sational purposes.
There are, as I remarked on a former occasion, a number of
*'Huohies" about,—quite a run on Huqhies,—which starts the
curious question as to unconscious nomenclature; that is, was there
a sort of general inspiration going about some time ago to call every
boy Hcghik, so that people utterly unknown to one another, living
hundreds of miles apart at the extreme points of the United King-
dom, when requested, as sponsors, to "think of a name"—(this sounds
like a game or a puzzle—" add ten to it—halve it—subtract fifty
from it")— all suddenly shouted " Hughie !" and positively refused
to think of any other. By this time, besides the preponderating
"HuoniE," a fair crop of Archies, Johnnies, Willies, Regies,
Alqies, and Charlies has sprung up, showing either that there
were several inspirations within a few months of one another, or
that a universal conspiracy to name every one "Huqhie " has been
broken up through the insubordination of some of its members, who
had rebelled against the arbitrary decree, and had gone in for other
names on their own individual responsibility. Occasionally.we come
across a Bob, now and then a Habry, sometimes a Tommy, and very
rarely a Neddy. They all come under the heading of " Johnnies,
and are particularised, to save trouble, as "this Johnny, that
Johnny, the other Johnny," and so forth.
Again, stopping on my road,—I've not "gone away" yet—I
notice the sudden familiarity characteristic of the most modern
manners. This tendency to call everyone by a Christian name, to
which I have just alluded, has reached suoh a pitch, that no one,
no matter to what respect his age, character, or social position may
entitle him, is safe, nowadays, from being addressed by his Christian
name by the most reoent and casually introduced acquaintance, who
establishes himself, within five minutes, on the footing of an intimacy
of half a lifetime, dating from your earliest schooldays, though
ten minutes ago you were utterly unconscious of your new acquaint-
ance's existence.
The age of universal brotherhood may be approaching, that happy
time when everybody shall call everybody else by any Christian
name, or petit nom that may occur to him, when everybody shall
dine with everybody else at anybody's expense, and all shall be
Johnnies. There may be just the faintest dimmest.prospect of some
suoh Paradise of Johnnies looming in the future; but, at present,
it is a very long way off, and just now we are in a state of general
familiarity which is as likely as not—in fact, more likely than not—
to lead to a row all round.
There are, of course, Johnnies and .Johnnies. They 're not all
friendly, though they are familiar; they don't all love one another, or
think highly of each other, and are, in fact, generally very wide
awake when they meet; and, while adopting an air of reckless
candour, have still "got a little bit up their sleeve," and are
uncommonly suspicious of even their dearest and most intimate
friends; though, of course, it immediately occurs to any logical

mind that if you are not suspicious of your most intimate friends,
of whose very smallest ways you know most, of whom would you be
suspicious? As a rule, when two or more JoiiNiriES meet, no
matter how friendly they may be, they are, for the first five minutes,
mutually distrustful. For instance, when Hug hie Beecham is in
a room with Willie Wadd, Archie Dyrstebshan and a few other
"Johitnies." the first assertion, or piece of information tendered by
any one of the party is met in a spirit of determined incredulity by
the others, who immediately throw out feelers, so to speak, and
cautiously inquire whether "there is a sell on" or not; and, if not,
does he really mean it, and so forth. The next anxiety on the part
of everybody, _ individually, is to be quite sure that ne personally
has not been singled out to be the victim of a practical joke played
on him by a combination company of all the others, and for the
first quarter of an hour or so each man keeps his eye on the looking-
glass, so as to command the general situation, and furtively puts
his hand behind his back, to feel if there's a piece of paper, or a
bit of string, or a long straw stuck under his coat-collar. After
ascertaining, each one to his own satisfaction, that none of these
contingencies have occurred, mutual confidence is gradually restored
until the time of departure arrives, when it becomes the one objeot
of each man to get out of the room as quickly, and as safely, as
possible.
As a rule, in spite of all this brotherly affection and calling of
Christian names, the Johnnie keeps his hat on when in a room with
other Johnnies, as, were it once off his head, it would be safe to be
tampered with. For this reason among others, the Johnnie seldom
carries an umbrella, usually preferring a hansom hired by the day
following at his heels, in which he can take refuge, at the first sign
of rain. But he clings to .his stick as to a talisman, and any
"nonsense " with this he deeply resents. _ No, the Johnnie's stick is
sacred,—at least, so long as he keeps it in his own hands: once out
of them, and the other Johnnies will hide it and forget where they
put it, or present it as a testimonial of regard and attachment to some
unsuspecting person, who accepts it in the most perfeot good faith.
This digression has arisen from the mention of Willie Wadd,
whose conversation chiefly consists of the catohy titles of the latest
music-hall songs, who suspects everybody of selling him, who meets
any piece of information with a sly wink, a shake of the head, and a
thrust in the ribs or a hit on the shoulder, and the observation, " Oh,

go along! "—meaning thereby that he is not
to be taken in, and that unless you take your
oath of it (he is evidently a man of religious
convictions), he will not believe you.
I happened to remark to Willie Wadd
that I was afraid I had a touch of gout, and
was not, in a general way,'' quite the thing,"
when he at once hit me on the shoulder (a
dangerous place for an invalid to be struck),
said, " You got the gout! Oh, go along 1"
and insisted that I was " selling him."
"Oh, yes," he says, slily, "there's some
sell on,—it won't do, you know."
In vain I try to argue reasonably with
him. What possible object, I put it to him
earnestly, could I have in pretending that I
had the gout when I hadn t? How could I
sell him? Where was the sell?
"Oh yes," he replies, shaking his head
knowingly; "it won't do—go along!" And
then he sings the refrain of a popular song,
of which the burden is, "I couldn't tell a lie
If I were to try, For I'm alwayB gay and
hearty"—which, being a decided reflection
on me, both in my character of a strictly
truthful man and an invalid, I cannot help
resenting. I speak more in sorrow than in
anger, like Hamlet's father's ghost, and beg
him to be serious for one moment, and to
oblige me by believing what I say. Not that,
as it occurred to me on after-coBsideration
when alone, it oould possibly matter to me
whether Willie Wadd disbelieved me or
not. And yet, on second thoughts, it might:
for might ne not tell his friends that I had
been trying to sell him, and add, "Oh, he's
always doing it; " so that henceforth—for
such a report would Bpread—any assertion'of
mine, no matter in what company it might
be made, would be immediately met with
winks of incredulity, would be treated as a
stupid joke, and I should be told by everybody
to Go along!" No— I feel I was quite right
in assuming an earnest and serious tone, and
thus impressing the flighty Willie Wadd,
who, but for this, might have seriously
damaged my character.
When he found I meant what I said, and
that I really had a touch of tho gout, and
was not altogether well, he evinced a deep
sympathy, which, in my turn, I began to
distrust; and whtn he put his hand on my
shoulder compassionately, I was obliged to
stop the conversation, and ask him if he had
Btuck a bit of paper on to my back, or under
my coat-collar, or hung anything on my
coat-tail buttons. He seemed hurt by my
suspicions, and assured me he had done
nothing of the sort. When, with a view
of making a deeper impression on him, I
repeat my Doctor's advice to go away,
Willie, who I do not think had been giving
me his undivided attention up to this part,
suddenly broke out with another comic
song which seemed to him appropriate to
the occasion. It was: "She told me to go
To Jericho: I said that I would do it"
—when, by one of those inexplicable inspi-
rations which occur when least expected,
and which can onlv be called a "Happy
Thought," the words Beemed to take this
form:—
He told me to go
To Monaco!
I said that I would do it.
And starting up, like Whittington when
he heard the bells calling him back again to
London (another Happy Thought this). I
said to Willie, "Yes, thanks; I will-
much obliged for the suggestion,"— and then
I left him, staggered, and still, I am con-
vinced, under the impression that I had
selling him"—though how he had

{By Our Own Philistine )
[Proposals are under consideration to run railways round the head of Der-
wentwater and round the shores of Loch Lomond.]
What ho! my merry Philistines, here's news and no mistake:
They 're going to run a railway round and spoil eaeh pretty lake;
And near the famous cataract that Sodthet sang of yore,
The locomotive's noise shall drown the murmur of Lodore.
Loch Lomond, too, shall have her train, and I would ask, why not—
There's "naething like gude dividends," is there, my canny Scot?
It's very well in poetry to talk of "banks and braes,"
But we prefer another bank that punctually pays.
Don't rave about your scenery, what's all such trash to me P
I only care for any view that brings in £ s. d.:
And if you'd know the kind of scene that I regard with pride,
A good coal-pit's the fairest thing upon the country-side.
A lake's a very useless thing, and only serves to drown
The lunatics who boat thereon; but ta'en in pipes to town,
As reservoir for waterworks, some little good it yields;
If not, it should be drained and made remunerative fields.
Then may the merry trains run on until each echo wakes,
And. let the locomotives scream by Scotch and English lakes;
And as commercial travellers are whirled by streams and hills,
They '11 sigh to think the scenery is charged for in the bills!
RARE ARTISTIC OPPORTUNITY.—Public Statue for Dis-

having received instructions from the trustees of that peculiar and
valuable artistic property, commonly known as the " Duke of Wel-
lington's Statue, and sometime prominently situate at Hyde-Park
Corner, to dispose of the same as soon as possible to the greatest
advantage, are prepared to receive tenders for the immediate recep-
tion either of the whole as it stands, or of various selected portions
by private arrangement. The attention of intending purchasers in
the travelling-circus line is specially directed to the unique features
possessed by this grotesque lot for the purposes of provincial adver-
tisement. Horse could be had separately. Duke no object. N.B.—
The latter would make a bold and graceful figure-head to a steam-
launch requiring a little weighting in the bows, or could, covered
with luminous paint, and seated on a garden wall, be utilised as a
handsome and effective scare to burglars. Might, in combination
with quinine, form the basis of a popular patent medicine. No

The official " confidential communication" as to his future polioy

managed to slip, the other day, into the leading columns of a con-
temporary, though encouraging and explicit, omitted to make the
following gratifying announcements:—
(1) His relations with his tradesmen and the other Great Powers
of Europe are satisfactory.
(2) His attitude towards the nation in face of recent events, will
still be one of comic fatherly interest.
(3) It is his intention, pending the development of further'great
political problems, to fit himself for the responsibilities of a national
crisis, by accepting a temporary engagement as Clown in a travelling
Circus. And
(4) He will not, therefore, after mature deliberation, demand a
plebiscite of the nation—just at present.
A FORLORN HOPE.
At a meeting of the London Diocesan Con-
ference, Mr. Bebesford Hope, speaking very
much against the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill,
is reported by the Morning Post to have said,
"Change the law, and could the sister-in-law
enter the house? (" JVb.'") Yes; if there were a
little private arrangement between them, she
could—{Laughter.)—but if she were a pure and
holy woman, who meant to continue a sister-in-
law, she could not." •»

When he spoke with misplaced hilarity
Upon the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill,
But of women and men he thinks bo ill,

that this act of justice may spetdily become law.

There is a new—political—bird,
With the croakiest croak that ever was heard,
In a state of alarm that is most absurd,
With fright every feather on end is stirred,
And into despair he'd talk us.
He views the State's great roundabout,
With the Liberals in and the Tories out,
And he hasn't the tiniest bit of a doubt
That we 're going wrong, and thall end in rout;
And he knows the reason, and croaks it about,
And whenever he goes on the stump to spout,
He cries—what cries he ?— Caucus !.' 7
"Speak gently to the Meerschaum!"
According to a local paper, the Mayor of Hastings and his brother
Magistrates, the other day, fined a young man five shillings for swear-
ing at his pipe, when he dropped it, on a Sunday. The Mayor pro-
bably had never had the misfortune to drop a beautifully-coloured
meerschaum in the street. However, this decision will be a warning
to visitors. A great many are now compelled to remain indoors.

Of groundage and lastage they likewise are free;
Of stallage and tidage in this sharp and quick age:
Moreover of rivage and wreck of the sea.

And sorceries, magic arts also, the same,
Forestallings, regratings, extortions—vexations
Of that sort whatsoever a lawyer may name.
VENTILATING QUESTIONS;
OB, THE STHANGEB OH THE EMBAHKMEKT.
1. Can this dirty-looking place where the boards and bricks are
scattered about, and where workmen are trampling on flower-beds,
and wheeling barrows of rubbish to and from an immense pit, be
really what the Guide-book describes as " the lovely Public Gardens
by the side of the Thames," or is it a private brick-field't
2. I had always heard that the Embankment was "the finest
Boulevard in Europe." Is it possible that the selfishness of private
enterprise, or the supineness of public authority, should allow the
only unequalled and unrivalled thoroughfare which London possesses
to be utterly ruined?
3. This third-rate shed, seventy feet Ion?, and twenty high, and
built in the plainest style of Neo-Gothio red-brick-and-slate archi-
tecture, must be either an experimental design for a cheaper kind of
workhouse, or one of the ventilators of the Underground Railway.

Company are about to obtain powers to open a ventilating shaft in
the nave of Westminster Abbey?

That
A "CASTE" IN OUR EYE.
Undoubtedly the best of Robertson's comedies. From first to
last it is amusing:, and always more or less interesting, according' to
the capability of the performers. The parts are all true to Nature,
—allowing here and there for a certain exaggeration necessary to
Drama,—and the Actors
have only to be true to art.
How well this is done may
be seen in Mrs. Bancroft's
admirable impersonation of
Polly Ecclet, Mr. Ban-
croft's Captain Hawtree,
and Mr. David James's
JEccles,—though, in the
last instance, this clever
artist is too much in-
clined to be gentle to the
old villain's vices, and to
tone down the character
into a weak, besotted old
fool,—to "draw it mild,"
in fact,—instead of in-
sisting on the more re-
pulsive features of the
character.
Ecclet has grown old in
wickedness: he is a de-
praved Captain Costigan;
a brute whose cruelty killed his wife, who made his weaker daughter
his drudge, who beat and bullied her (we know all this from her
own account), who would have sold his girls to the highest bidder,

A Hit. An unrehearsed effect. "Don't
make a noise, or else j ou '11 wake the Baby!"

Fearful Scene between 8ulky 8am and Polly in the
Borough Road. "Who gave you those rings?"
or committed any crime, had the opportunity offered and the reward
sufficient. It is a mistake, though probably not so from a Low
Comedian's point of view, to give undue prominence to the temporary
maudlin or convivial aspect of this irreclaimable old scoundrel.
Robertson was inspired by Thackeray in many of his pieces:
in Caste, Ecclet is founded, as we have said, on Cottigan: Hawtree
is a fashionable Dobbin: Polly Ecclet is a very superior Fanny
Bolton; and Sam Gerridge is founded on Sam Huxter, who dislikes
Pendennit as cordially as Gerridge dees Hawtree, and who marries
Fanny Bolton.
The dialogue is not brilliant,—that is, if by " brilliant" is meant
a lot of Bharp epigrammatio sentences dealt out at hap-hazard to the
dramatis persona all round, without any reference to their individu-
ality, and worked up into dialogue,—but it is thoroughly natural.
Polly talks as such a Polly would talk, and her mild joke about
Hatotree looking as if he were " superior to ham and up to tongue,
glazed," is thoroughly enjoyed by the audience as being capital
'for her"—due credit being given, of course, for the inimitable
way in which it is given by Mrs. Bancroft.
Mr. Brookfield makes Sam Gerridge too brutal. He looks like
a ruffianly costermongcr, lurching and sulking about, as if he'd got
a knife in his
pocket to stick
into Hawtree:
and so evident is
it that he only
wants just a
little more pro-
vocation from
Polly in order to
give her a con-
vincing proof of
the thickness of
his boots, that he
excites the com-
passion of the
audience for the
sprightly girl
whose fate it is
to be linked for
life to this ruf-
fian, and who will
come out of her
honeymoon with a black eye, aohing bones, and a broken heart. So
"nasty " appears to be his temper, that his worst suspicions must
have been aroused by the glitter of the numerous gold rings which
ornament Polly Eccles' fingers. Polly is only a ballet-girl,
receiving a pound a week, and, of course, it must speak very highly
for her thrift if, after subscribing to the household expenses and
giving father his sixpence on Saturday, she can have saved up
enough to buy rings representing, we should say, a matter of about
a few hundred pounds or so. Sam has an eye to those ornaments,
and from his manner, we should surmise that he intends to marry
her first, beat her next, rob her after-
wards, and realise as muoh as he can
on the jewellery. We don't think
Robertson ever meant Polly Ecclet
to wear these rings,—at all events, not
without some explanation as to their
being honestly come by. Sam is
instinctively jealous of Hawtree, and
we fancy that if he had caught them
in that back kitchen, to which they
retire for a considerable time, in the
First Act, there would either have
been a big row, or Sam would have
accepted the situation, and looked
forward to a further instalment of
diamond rings.
The Honourable George D'Alroy is
made rather too hard by Mr. Conway;
he does not impress us as being really
in love with his wife, or caring a scrap
for his mother.
Whether Miss Gerard, as Esther,
is too theatrical when she ought to be
natural, as in her grief in the Second
Act, and in her burst of passion in the
Third, and too natural when she might
well be theatrical—that is, when at
home, in the First Act, where, we may say, the " scent of the foot-
lights is over them all "—is difficult to deoide; but in neither
instance did she appear to win sympathy.
Mrs. Sterling, as the Marquise, is simply perfect. Had the
Author been living now, we fancy he would not have brought on
Eccles and Sam in the Second Act, and would have

lines which from time to time are lagged in to attract the
attention of the audience to the word "Caste," as if he
himself was doubtful as to the congruity of the title with
the story, and was anxious to lose no occasion of connecting
it with the action, as if the whole thing were a charade.
Perhaps we may
be hypercritical,
if so, it must be
set down to obli-
quity of vision
from the fact of
having a "Caste"
in our eye when
we went to the
} laymarket. But,
be this as it may,
the performance
is well worth
seeing, the play
is charming, and
the evening
passes only too
quickly; laugh-
ter and tears
alternate, and in
view of its being
shelved for
Fedora, we ad-
vise everyone to
see it while they
can, or hereafter those who have missed the chance will
regretfully own that "they have lost Caste."
As we were leaving the theatre, a friend, deeply
interested in the play, observed thoughtfully to us—"I
wonder what the future of all these people would be in a
Fourth Act." He has since thought it out, and the
following is the result:—
ACT IV.
The Scene represents the dratcing-room of a nine-roomed
Villa at Brixton Rite. Esther discovered saving
together little diagonal pieces of brightly-coloured
satin, and embroidering them tcith spangles. Enter
Polly, quietly but handsomely dressed, <
Polly {announcing herself). "Mrs. Samuel Ger-
ridge." Where's your butler?
Esther. Ah, Poi.lt, it isn't always a butler that
makes the true happiness of married lite.
Polly. No; it s his livery. Happy? Why, you
haven't even got your title on the door-plate!
Esther. No, indeed not. For my brave and reflective
George is so good. He says that as he has discovered
it is quite impossible that I can ever live up to his rank,
he will do his best and try and live down to mine.
He is going on the Stage. See—(holding up her work)—
I am making him his first Harlequin's dress!
Polly. I hope it's loose.
Esther. It is, dear. But now tell me about Sam.
_ Polly. Samuel, if you please. Don't out him in half
like an over-sized orange. You forget that I'm in
Society, and that he's up for the Junior Carlton.
Enter D'Alroy. He is carrying a baby in hit arms, and
is followed by five other children, ranging respectively
in age from six downwards, and all more or less
bruised, and covered with mud.
D'Alroy. Ah, my darling; we 've had such a glorious
morning in Eennington Park! I've been lying on my
back and kicking all the children into the air. Look
at them I I should have balanced the baby, only the
Police interfered.
Esther. My brave, dear, clumsy, but daring George!
My husband! Who would have thought that when I
married you I should ever have lived to be the mother
of the talented D'Alroy Troupe!
D'Alroy {kissing her). My own dear, true, little
vulgar-minded wife (taking down his regimental sword).
By the bye, this may as well find its way to Atten-
borough's—eh?
Esther. No, darling. Keep it, and swallow it—for
my sake! [_They embrace.
Enter Hawtree. He has on a mechanic's brown-paper
cap and soiled brown holland apron.
Polly. Good gracious! What is the matter with the
Major?"
Hawtree. Gas. Fact. Gone in for trade, you know. Couldn't pull along
with that good fellow, Gerridge, in any other way. Aw—no I
D'Alroy. But I thought you had been trying to do the Park with him?
Hawtree. Aw—yaas.
D'Alroy. And got cut by every fellow you met?
Hawtree. Aw—yaas.
D'Alroy. And so then you put him up at the Club? Eh?
Hawtree. Aw—yaas.
D'Alroy. And he has been thunderingly pilled?
Hawtree. Aw—yaas.
Polly. Well, then, the firm is henceforth Gerridge, Hawtree & Co.? I
rather like the sound of it. How odd, that you should finish up with gas!
D'you know now you always did look to me something like a lamp-post.
Hawtree. Aw—firm-footed—I suppose?
Polly. No. Light-headed. [ They go up the stage.
Enter Gerridge with the Marquise de St. Maur on his arm,
Marquise (releasing him). Thanks! Ah, George, my dear boy, you know
that 1 have long been endeavouring to accommodate myself to the unique
circumstances and surroundings of your new connections, with all the hereditary-
tact and determination of our race. Hitherto I have only partially succeeded.
To-day, it is true, on my way here, at the earnest solicitation of this
oharmingly original young man, I stopped and partook of a recherche' little
dejeuner sans fourchetle of whelks at a stall in the Borough Road.
Gerridge. I stood 'em.
Marquise (smiling). And no Bayard could have done more. But I am now
going to crown my efforts by a supreme act the like of which even my old
friend Froissart has not yet had to chronicle. I owe you all restitution and
apology for feelings cruelly wounded in the past. I can think of no reparation
■o fitting and complete as this. (She opens door, and leads in Kcci.es. He is
perfectly sober, respectably dressed, and decorated with the badge of the Blue

I know there is an Eccles now. George, behold your future stepfather!
George. This is indeed, dear mother, a pleasure and a surprise! Can it
really be true?
Eccles. Yes, my boy! (Sings) "They have married me to a Marquizzy."
Marquise. And you see he is already voui au Ruban bleu!
Eccles. Just so. And as I don't happen to have a friend awaiting round the
corner, I shouldn't mind a gallon or two of tea, if there's any going.
Polly. Of course. Come along all of you. This is my day. Five

House of Commons, Monday Night, Feb. 19.—" I'm not much up
in Agriculture," said Mr. Harran, surveying the house critically,
as if measuring it for a new suit; "but I hear it's in a very
depressed state Certainly depression is admirably reflected in the
debate. Think I '11 go and spend the evening with my friend

Old Man had ruffled his hair, mangled his shirt collar, pulled his
scarf awry, rubbed his hat on the wrong side of the nap, and thus
arrayed (''like Jeremiah in a dull moment," as Sir Charles Dilke
said), announced that he'd made up his mind not to vote against Bill
at this Btage. Sepulchral tones, mournful inflection, woebegone
countenance. Then, holding the ruffled hat well out bo that it might
have due effect, he solemnly strode forth shaking off dust of House
from his feet. A sight to make angels weep; but ribald House only
laughed.

Fourth Party that has led to their success. Each has distinot way
of standing whilst addressing the House. Sir Henkt Wot.ff, with

arms akimbo, legs slightly astride, chest expanded, and a pleasant
smile lurking about nis massive countenance, stands well out in
view of the House. If he simply stood there and said nothing, the
speech would be eloquent. "Here I am, a buttress of Church and
State, the censor of diplomatic jobs, a guardian of British Honour,
custodian of the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Alexandria."
Randolph makes all his points with his left toe. If the Speaker
were to rule it out of order that Members addressing the House
should stand on their right leg, with the left heel downwards,
and the tip of shoe pointing to the ceiling, Randolph would be
dumb. Wish we'd thought of that when Rules of Procedure going
through. Fanoy could have worked in an Amendment by large
majority.
This pedal movement more remarkable, since Mr. Goest, watchful
of his great leader, frequently imitates it,'in variation of an earlier
manner of balancing his body from foot to foot, as if the iron floor of
the House were uncomfortably hot. Mr. Balfour bends his tall
figure over the House as if he loved it, certain that all would be well
if it would yield to his guidance and throw out Mr. Gladstone.
Shall get my party together, and drill them in these various
attitudes.
To-night, full opportunity of studying the Lord Chancellor Gorst,
who moves Amendment on Address, and trots out old stories about
Kilmainham. Rapturous cheering from Mr. Warton, Mr. Alder-
man Fowler, and Lord Randolph, himself, who has lent his seat to
the Lord Chancellor, and hands him up his extraots.
"A six-and-eightpenny sort of young man, Gorst," said Har-
court. "A great light lost to Polioe-Court practice. Would have
■hone in dark recesses of County Courts, or even made a name on
the blazing roll of Quarter-Sessions fame. A little acid for the
House of Commons."
But then Mr. Gorst had just referred to the Home Secretary as
"incompetent."
Business done.—Strolling through Address.

At eight o'clock Liberal Party adjourned to Devonshire Club.
Elected Mr. Catnb Speaker. Very interesting proceedings. Mr. S.
Bhith took the oath and his seat for Liverpool, and subsequently
made short speech. Speech of evening, Lord Richard Grosvenoh's.
Summed up whole duty of Liberal Member under three heads:—
(1) Always vote with the Government; (2) Always dine in the House
of Commons; (3) Never speak unless you are intimately acquainted
with the subject. This last might well be emblazoned over Speaker's
chair. Would do more to shorten Parliamentary proceedings than
any other form of cloture.
Wonderful dormant talent for oratory among the Whips! Sir
Williah Dtke now becoming one of chief orators on Front Bench.
Lord Richard never speaks in the House, but evidently not because
he can't. Lord Kensington a model speaker. Occasionally, in
capacity of Vice-Chamberlain, brings in messages from high lati-
tudes. Does he, by way of introduction, glance at the Heptarchy,
trace the growth of Royalty, touch upon the interruption of the
Commonwealth, dilate upon the domestic felicity of the Georges,
summarise the principal events of the Viotorian Era, and then
arrive at his speech? He does not. He says, "A Message from the
Queen," walks up to the table, reads it, and then goes his way.
We want a little more of that kind of oratory in the House.
Business done.—Afternoon wasted.
Thursday Night.—At exaotly seventeen minutes to eight The
O'Kellt exploded. Saw it coming for some time. Steam up within
ten minutes of Forstkr's rising. At first seemed likely that Mr.
O'Brien, the latest messenger of peace from Ireland, would go off
first. Fortunately, had O'Donnell to look after him, who suc-
ceeded in keeping him moderately quiet.
"Never do anything violent," Mr. O'Donnell whispered in ear of
neophyte. "Violence doesn't do here. Always puts you at dis-
advantage. Be calm. Carefully select your words, and you will
prosper. But never throw your boot at the head of the Speaker, or
tear up the Benoh to obtain an additional argument wherewith to
convince a Minister."
This oounsel prevailed with O'Brien, still young to the place.
But the O'Kellt too old a steam-engine to be cooled down by jets of
that sort.
"When the O'Kellt begins to simmer, be Bure he'll bust,"
Joseph Gillis said, in that sententious way recently adopted; and
"bust" he did, throwing off his balance for a moment, Forster, who
had been sitting on safety-valve.
"Dear me!" said Sir Charles Forster, when the fragments of
The O'Kellt were picked up, and carried out in two baskets.
"Place begins to have quite a home-feeling. Been sitting here a
week now, and this is the first Irish Member expelled."
Fobster walked home to late dinner in highest spirits.
"My dear Tobt," he said, stretching his mighty limbs, and putting
his coat on upside down for a few minutes to refresh himself.
(Wouldn't have noticed the change, only saw him do it.) "This is
the best night I have had since I made statement in the House on
resignation, and gave my old colleagues a dig here and there. I
have Buffered a good deal from Parnell and his friends. Have sat
night after night, and been pelted with mud and stones by them.

as befits my Quaker parentage. But I own I like a fight, especially
when 1 choose my time, get a man in a oorner, and can pound him

laoked. Instead of getting out of Forsteb's way, ran straight at
him, gripped him tightly, and if one had not been so heavy and

WILL IT ALL END IN
SMOKE?
Certain Music-Halls wish to
'become Theatres, and nightly
break the law, more or leas, to
gratify their wishes. Being
proseonted, they intend to apply
to Parliament for a special Cen-
sorship and special privileges.
Certain Theatres, hearing of this,
will want to become Mnsio-Halls,
or, in other words, will want
that liberty, which the Lord
Chamberlain refuses them, to
allow smoking in the auditorium.
The question of drinking hardly
enters into the discussion, as the
facilities for drinking in Theatres
are hardly more restricted than
they are in Music-Hails. The
point is really one of tobacco :—
Shall the Public smoke or not in
the face of the British Drama?
The Public, if consulted, which
they never have been, would pro-
bably answer, Yes, leaving the
Managers to settle what Theatres
should be smoking-Theatres, and
what Theatres should remain as
they are. In London, forty years
ago, smoking-Theatres were per-
mitted without any visible injury
to the Public, to Art (with the
capital A), or to the British
Drama, and in nearly every other
European city, at the present day,
they are a recognised and popular
institution.
Whether the two most Con-
servative and Protectionist Bodies
in England—the Theatre Proprie-
tors and the Music-Hail Pro-
prietors—will face this free-trade
difficulty in the only way in which
it can be faced, remains to be
seen, but our own impression is
that they will not have the ne-
cessary courage. The Public—
never consulted or thought of—
may have to wait 'for the New
Municipal Government Bill, and
even this may be mangled and
worried by Vested Interests.

WHISTLER IN VENICE.
A Gayottk in Gamboge.
Go to the Fine Art Sooiety,
Truly a marvellous show,
See, in a wondrous variety,
Etchings and dry points a-row.
Here we can note all the genesis
Of the Whistlerian art;
This is what Whistler thinks
Venice is,
Jimmy is certainly " smart."
Strangely adorned is the Gallery,
Done up in gamboge and white,
Even the flunkey is yallery,"
Made a most exquisite fright.
We may be thought supercilious,
But, if the truth must be told,
It looks consumedly bilious,
This new "arrangement in
gold."
Then there's the Catalogue criti-
oaL
In which the versatile James
Sneers at the pens analytical,
Calling them all by their names.
Each annotation is peppery,
Full of American gall;
Whistler is such a high stepper,
he
Prances at will o'er them all.
It must be said too with gratitude,
There was the Artist himself,
Airy and artful in attitude,
Truly a curious elf.
Whistler is "Niminy-Piminy,"
Funny, fantastic, and quaint,
Yet he's so clever that Jimmy
nigh
Makes men believe he can paint.
What of his works? why, each
etching is
Only at present half done.
And on the copper the sketching is
Simply a wild pieoe of fun.
Vainly the Critics will sit on him,
Why suoh a butterfly slay?
No one can e'er put the bit on
him—
Whistler's the wag of the
day.
THE SILVER WEDDING.
(By our Extra Special at Pigglezwhisllezhqf, Berlin.)
Hers I am in the capital of Prussia, enjoying thoroughly the
festivities inaugurating the second quarter of a century of the
married life of the Princess Royal of England and the Prince
Imperial of Germany. All the way to this beautiful oity I noticed
the natives waiting for the floods to subside before commencing the
sowing of wheat, rye, oats, barley, peas, millet, rape-seed, and the
other grain mentioned by good old Whitaker in his amusing
Almanack. I could see by the expression of their faoes that they
were taking a great interest in the celebration, and were, no doubt,
lamenting that the water kept them looked in the Provinces when
they would have preferred to be in Town.
And what is Berlin like? Well, the question is not an easy one
to answer. It resembles Rome and Wandsworth equally, but,
perhaps, is more like Gravesend than either. The finest building in
a oity of fine buildings is a large edifice not unlike St. Paul's,
Hampton Court, and the Crystal. Palace, called Unter den Linden.
It was in this magnificent edifice that most of the ceremonies took
place. It was here that the venerable Emperor danced the old
saraband (dear to every Teutonio heart) with Prince Von Bismarck,
whose faltering steps were superintended by the State Doctor. It
was here also that the wedding breakfast (eaten off silver plate, in
honour of the day) was held.
Here, again, a certain noble Englishman (whose name I suppress
for obvious reasons) won a wager that he would ride a mule forty
miles, without turning a hair, before breakfast. Here once more
were held the review of 100,000 troops and the afternoon tea given
by the Empress (two days since) to half-a-dozen of her more inti-
mate friends. Unter den Linden is indeed a marvellous building, and
seems a suitable place for any and every kind of innocent dissipation.
All the world is here. You meet Royalties at every street-corner,
and the contingent, " personally conducted " by the first of English
tour-organisers, are not only numerous but even respectable. The
city is oovered with bunting. Flags float from every window; and
the masses of colour of the Ladies resemble a parterre of flowers.
Of course the great attraction are the presents. In honour of the
event they are all of silver. Perhaps the prettiest article is a gold
workbox made entirely of the whiter metal. Then there are silver
boots, silver handkerchiefs, silver gloves, and silver sealing-wax.
The only thing that is not of silver is a silver thimble, which is made
of gold. This curious little article was presented by the Padishah,
who, as everyone knows, is proud of his Irish extraction.
Last night there was a grand torchlight procession. A thousand
flares, a thousand shadows, dots of colour here and there, relieved by
dark stone masonry. The joy-bells of cathedrals, and the sad tinkling
of the sounding brass of many military bands. In the background
the stern mountains tipped with snow, and, over all, a glorious moon
floating through scores of purple clouds, gorgeous with the hues of a
hundred sunset tinges.
And here 1 pause, as I have just been summoned to join in the
Elizabethan Quadrille, which is now about to be danced in the
Winter Palace.
[It is only just to ourselves and the Public to say that the envelope con-
taining the above communication bears the Chelsea post-mark. We print the
article, however, as it seems to be the kind of thing published in the columns
of our contemporaries.—Editor.]

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
'ROBERT" INTERVIEWED.

1 Was a sctliug quietly at liuine one day last Autumum our black
season, when a ring cam to oar bell and then a nock come at my
door, and I says, Come in," says I, and in come a Gent as I never
seed afore and have never seed Bence, and he says to me, says he,
"Are yon Mr. Robert, tho' I needn't ask, for I nose you at once by
your likeness," and he pulls out a coppy of the emusin publikashun
in which I sumtimes appears, need I say Punch, scarcely, praps.
Well, he then tells me as how he was interwooing all the horthers
and hartists of Punch, at the request of the P e of W 8, for
his privet oollecshun of the silly braties of the Age, and will I mind
ansering him a few questions.
Well, I was natrally ighly flattered and not a little pleesed at
sitch an igh honner, and sed yes, I thort I would if they wasn't not
hobjectionabel as regards pecoonary matters. So out he takes a
longish littel book and off he starts with such a list of questions as
amost made my air stand on end with trying to anser. Wen he had
quite dun he shook ands with me wery f rendly, and he says, says he,
'' Mr. Robert, I am that obligated to you for your kyindness, that
I shall report werry favorably to His Royal Ighness, and I calclate
as you '11 be sure to reseeve at the propper time the oustomerry
dimond snuff-box." I bleeve I axshally terned pail with surpressed
estonishment. He added as he thort as how his work would be
finished and all complete by about nex April, early in April, perhaps
the werry erliest day in April, on which day he thort I might safely
oalklate on receving my dimond box. I wentured to hint as I hoped
he would say as many good words for me as he could consienshusly,
when he said., " Why, oert'nly," and away he went.
I leave my reeders to judge of my state of mind after my Miss
Terryhus friend's departure, and I draws a whale over Mrs.
Robert's emotion wen I told her all about it, and how she nat'rally
regretted as she was out a-shoppin at the Grosers wen it all apened,
or she would suttenly have Burgested a Broche or a Brayslet instead
of the snuff-box. Well, munse rolls by, and April seems still a
werry long ways off, when ony yesterday I receeves a noosepaper
and a letter from Ameriky to the following stronery effec:—
"Boston Journal Office, U.S.
"Dk*r Mb. Robert, March, 1883.
"Recalling to your recollection our very pleasant inter-
view in October last, and apologising for some slight variation from
the actual facts of the oaae in which I indulged on that interesting
ocoasion, I now beg to inform you that although it was not strictly
true that I was collecting valuable information for H.R.H. the
P e of W 8, yet that, as my Editor is the Prince of Good
Fellows, it comes to much the same thing, and although he has,
unfortunately, no diamond snuff-box that he can conveniently spare
at the present time, I send you. at his request, a copy of his priceless
Journal, in which you will find our interview almost literally
reported, for the instruction and amusement of Bome thirty millions
of the smartest people in all creation.
"Tours, with all dne respect, Washington Jones."
I dare not trubhel you with the whole account, so I sends you a
few extra* :—
"I found Mr. Robert in a very decent sort of room, nice and clean
and comfortable, and he answered my questions with the greatest
readiness and affability, and our interview was, upon the whole, one
of the most amusing I ever had with any literary oelebrity.
"When were you born, Mr. Robert ?—I don't exacly know.
Most likely in the middle of the night,—most people is, I think.
"Bat what year were yon born? I haven t the least idea, but 1
knows as I'm just fifty-eight.
"Where were you born P—In Whetstone Park.
"Oh, indeed! Pray in what County is the Park situate ?—I don't
know what County, but I think it's in the Parish of St. Giles's, the
same as the Seven Dials.
"Where were you educated P— Well, I can't say as I was reg'lar
eddicated anywheres in partickler. My werry erliest recklections
being connected with carrying home of greens and taturs for my
Father, who was a Green Grocer, and used to go out a waiting at
dinners and heavning parties, dressed just like a Parson, to the
admirashun of all on us, and it was that as kindled the burning
desire in my manly buzzum to become some day a real Waiter!
"And Fortune has smiled upon your efforts ?—Well, Fortune has
guv me about three pound a week, which 'nd make most people
smile, I should think.
"Why cert'nly. What first induoed you to turn yonr attention to
literature P—Well, Sir, it apened in this most remarkabel way. The
Punch Staff was a dining at the onnered Albion, one night, and the
well-known Hediter appened to say 'There's no man living as
couldn't find sumthink emusin to say if he only knew how to say it.
Why, this werry respectable Waiter,' says he, 'who is atending to
us bo admirably, could tell us many a good story if he chose.' And
turning round, he Bays to me, with his merry blue eyes a twinklin
with fun, 'What's your name. Waiter P' 1 Robert,' says I.
'Well,' says he,'ain't I right, Robert?' 'Well, praps you axe, and
praps you ain't, Sir,' says I. 'Will yon try?' says he, with a merry
laugh. 'I don't much oare if I do,' says I. 'Then write down
sumthink,'says he,' and bring it to me in a day or two.' And bo I did,
and I've writ him enuff since then to about fill a littel wollume.
"Would it be an impertinent question to ask what amount of
remuneration you receive for your priceless contribution ?—Tes, it
would be a werry imperant question, and wot's wuss, a werry use-
less one. But you can judge for yourself of its fabbulous amount
wen I tells you as it ennables me to Bend my boy William to the
Uaiwersity of Cambridge.
"The University I—Tes; the Uniwersity. I remember one of my
plessant paytrons once asking me weather he went as a Sizer, or as
a Pensioner, or as a Fellow Commoner ?—and I said as 1 thought he
might be said to be all three.
How so, Mr. Robert ?—Well, as he stands 6-foot-2 in his stock-
ings, let alone his boots, he may fairly be called a good Sizer, and as
I allows him no less than 10«. a week, he must suttenly be a
Pensioner, and as he alius has his commons with his fellow Waiters,
he may propperly be called a Fellow Commoner.
"Bravo, Mr. Robert! that's one to you, as we say at the Club,
but what made you send him to the University ?—Well, you see as
he aspires to be sum day a Head Waiter, like his Father, I thort as
I'd give him jast 12 months' experience at Trinity, where I was told
as how they could give even the old Copperation one course as a
start, and yet win in a canter.
"And does your son find it so ?—He does, and speaks of 'em with
that amount of enthoosiasm as amost draws tears from my eyes.
"I suppose you sometimes hear things said that would very much
astonish the public if known P—Ah, you 're about right thare, 8ir.
Tou see when men are full of wittles and full of wine, whether
they 're Princes or Statesmen or even Lord Mares, they 're a good
deal off their gard. and they all seems to think as us Waiters is def.
which we ain't. Why sumtimes wen I'm just a little short of
money, about this time of the year, I has thnrts of offering to some
emmenent Publisher my " Rewelations of an Head Waiter," but then
comes my 2nd thorts, which in this case is alius the best, coz they 're
the most honnerablest, and I says to myself, No, Robert, endure
your honnerabel poverty and enjoy your self-respec, and never
betray the confidens reposed in your honnerabel profession for the
sake of filthy luker. And so the mean thort wanishes away, and I
am still abel to look all my Paytrons in the faoe without the blush
of Sham."
We had a good deal more tork afore he went away, all of which
he has bin and gone and writ down, but I dessay my readers has
had about enuff of his Amerioan imperanoe, as I have of his shameful
desepshun. Robert.

"Hi! Brown! Why ab« you like an Irish Dktectivb? Give

THEATRE ROYAL, WESTMINSTER.
Under the Management of Sir Verdant Harcourt, the Seldom-al-Home
Secretary.
The Manager begs to announce that the Old English Comedy of
The Government of London, in Two Acts, which has had a successful
run of nearly thirty years, to the entire satisfaction of an enlightened
Public, will be shortly replaced by a Screaming Farce, in One Act,
entitled The Brand New Municipality; or, A Leap in the Dark.
He is also happy to be enabled to announce that the characters of
"The Three Solemn Leaguers" will be played by "The Bounding
Brothers of Chelsea," and that fabulous terms haye been offered to
His Grace the Duke of Pimlico, to induce him to take the part of
The New Lord Mayor,—that arrangement failing, the part will be
offered to Mr. Toole.
The Manager submits the first two Scenes, as a sample of what the
Public may expect:—
Scene—A blotted Heath. Thunder, lightning, and drenching rain.
Enter The Three Solemn Leaguers, with umbrellat up.
First Leaguer. When shall we three meet again P
When there ain't quite so much rain?
Second Leaguer. When the Corporation's done,
When we have our good berths won.
Third Leaguer. Then we '11 have some jolly fun I
First Leaguer. Where the place?
Third Leaguer. Oh, in some dark Court,
There to meet with rash McHaecoubt.
Two drums! two drums! McHaecoubt comes I
All Three. The Three Leaguers, hand in hand,
Sick at sea and mocked on land,
Thus do go about, about,
Three good lies, and three of thine,
And three of thine to make up nine,
Peace! the charm's wound up I
£ Enter McHaecoubt and McDilke, in tourist suits, followed by
; two Detectives disguised as Keepers.
McHarcourt. Nor fowl nor hare to-day I have not seen.
McDilke. How far is't called to Chelsea P
McHarcourt. Who are you? You should be gentlemen,
And yet your seedy looks do make me doubt
That you are so. Speak, if you can! What are you P
First Leaguer. All hail, McHabcouet! Hail to thee, great M.P. I
Second Leaguer. All hail, McHaecoubt! Hail to thee, Home-
Secretary!
Third Leaguer. All hail, McHabcouet! That shalt the Pbkmieb
be! [They vanish.
McDilke. This heath hath humbugs e'en as Chelsea hath,
And these are of them.
McHarcourt. Would we had never seen them! [Exeunt.
Scene II.—A Printing Office in the Strand.
Enter the Three Solemn Leaguers.
First Leaguer. Thrice the gin punch haye we brewed!
Second Leaguer. Thrice; and once on pig we've dined!
Third Leaguer. Haecouet cries, 'Tis time! 'tis time!
First Leaguer. Now about our task we '11 go;
In the poisoned slanders throw.
Lies that in the month that's come—
Days and nights juBt thirty-one—
Fools and dolts for truth have took,
Put we first in our lying book!
All. Hubble, bubble, toil and trouble,
Lies and shams and sneers we double.
First Leaguer. Here's a sting like a gnat.
Third Leaguer. Put in that, put in that.
Second Leaguer. Here's Badlaw's brain.
Third Leaguer. Put in a grain.
First Leaguer. Here's mud from cads, and slime that's badder.
Third Leaguer. That will make our foes much madder.
All. Hubble, bubble, &c, &c.
Third Leaguer. Oh, well done! He '11 commend our pains,
And everyone shall share the gains.
All goes right, and nought goes wrong,
So let us sing our jolly song.
SONG (WITH CHORUS).
Am—" If I had a Thousand a Tear."
First Leaguer.
I once was a Member of Parliament,
And had two thousand a year.
But I couldn't control my unruly tongue,
So now I find myself bare.
But in the New Munioipalitee
I a something shall find that will just suit me,
So that is why I am here, my Boys, I Repeat in
So that is why I am here. ) Chorus,
Second Leaguer.
Though I am a Member of Parliament,
I have not two thousand a year;
But I soon got a little, and hope to get more,
Though I shall have to wait long, 1 fear:
But in the New Municipalitee, &c.
Third Leaguer.
I ne'er was a Member of Parliament,
And never shall be one, I fear;
But the be-all and end-all of my public life
Is to get just two thousand a year.
And in the New Municipalitee, &c.
[At the end of the Chorus they join hands and dance to the tune
of" We are a Merry Family, we are, we are .'" and vanish
— till they reappear in their next Scene.
The "Royal" Amusements. — There are a wonderful pair of
Clowns—no not Pantaloons—styling themselves "The Two Macs,"
now performing at the Royal Music-Hail. Their fight is one of the
most astonishing and amusing things we've seen for a long time.
They ought to call their entertainment "The Two Macs and the Fifty
Smacks, which, being successful, they '11 stick to like wax." And
they really seem to like whacks. The Proprietors must be doing un-
commonly well, as there's a considerable amount of Coyne—no
duller, but the genuine article every evening. But when shall we
have the part-songs and the glees, ancient and modern, back again,
as in the good old days. Consuls "Paddy" at Evans'sF Just a
sprinkling of these, sung by well-trained choristers, would be higiily
acceptable to a considerable portion of the public, which is at pres 11
prejudiced, and not altogether unreasonably, against the usual kind
of Musio-Hall Entertainment.

Fawn trembles at thb rustlino of the Autumn Leaves? Why"

POPULAR SUPERSTITIONS EXPLAINED.
1. It is unlucky to spill salt. Of course, for it shows that you are either naturally clumsy,
or that your hand is unsteady from over-indulgenoe in tobacco, and anyhow it is certain to
raise the wrath of your host.
2. It is untuck;/ to pass under a ladder. This is when the Gentleman on the ladder is con-
versing with a fellow labourer, and lets fall a hod of mortar, or a pot of red paint on your head.
3. It it unlucky to pass outside a ladder. This is when the ladder projects to the curb-
stone, the road is very muddy, and a runaway van is in your immediate neighbourhood.
4. It's lucky to have a black cat in the house. Its presence accounts for the disappearance
of cream, cold game, and other viands notoriously detrimental to the health.
5. It is unlucky to dream of a black dog. Of course, as it shows that your present habit
of late suppers will shortly be stopped by your medical attendant.
6. It is unlucky to meet a woman with a squint. It is a great misfortune to encounter an
ugly woman anywhere.
7. It is unlucky to sneeze on a Friday. It
is not particularly fortunate on any other
day of the week, as it probably shows you
are in for a severe cold.
8. It is lucky to hop upstairs as the New
Year comes in. It ameliorates your grief
at the follies of last year, as it shows how-
ever capable of idiocy you were then, you
are still more capable this year.
9. It is unlucky to see a single magpie. It
indicates that there are more in the neigh-
bourhood; and for discordant noises the
magpie is pre-emiaently gifted among birds.
10. It is lucky to see the first lamb of the
year with its face towards yuu. It any rate
shows that neither your visage nor your
apparel is so absolutely repulsive as to
frighten a beast of the field.
11. It is unlucky to sit down to table
thirteen in number. It is equally unluoky
to sit down twelve if there is only elbow-
room for eight.
12. There is luck in odd numbers. This
entirely depends upon the game you are
playing, and what the other man has up his
sleeves.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED PROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
'^Monday Night, February 26.—Great joy in House of Lords to-
night. A Bill is brought in, and prospect of some work. Rather
hard on Noble Lords of late. Come down regularly at four o'olock;
see Lord Chancellor enter with bag and baggage; hear youngest
Bishop say prayers; sit and look at each other tor a few minutes;
then somebody asks question, somebody else answers it; and they
walk wearily away.
"Lords might as well be abolished at once," says Our Only
General and Latest Peer. "Every night I come down here I feel
like Schacabac going to dine with Barmecide."
"Schacabac ?" said Our Only Commander-in-Chief. "Schaca-
bac? Don't seem to remember him? What's his regiment?"
"He was not in the Army, Sir," Wolseley explained. "He was
a Scotchman travelling in the East."
Wolseley's picked up a good deal of information since he went
to Cairo. Quite pathetic interest round Our Only Bill, which is for
electing Scotch Representative Peers. Marquis of Huntly dread-
fully afraid we shall gobble it up at one meal, and begs Lord
Chancellor not to hurry along with Second Reading. Lord Chan-
cellor promises, and Peers go home pleased.
In House of Commons another dull night. Still harping on the
Address. Had Ireland with us through most of last week, on one
Amendment or other. Now Ireland has an Amendment all to her
unhappy self. Begin afresh, and go through the old familiar story.
"Quite a mistake," Mr. Cottrteney complains, "to say you can't
eat your cake and have it. Irish Members ate their cake last week
on Gorst's Amendment, and now here it oomes served up again full-
size, and they munch it all night."
In distress of body and soul, under this wearisome wet blanket of
words, House spasmodically attempts to be merry. Determines to
laugh " whateffer" as Mr. Macfarlane says since he has been to
Styornaway. To-night, for example, Mr. Callan up; referring to
some statement he doesn't believe says, " Well, I can swallow a
good deal, but "Here the House breaks in with roar of
laughter. Laughs consummately for space of three or four minutes.
Suppose there's a joke somewhere. Talk it over with Sir George
Balfour and Mr. Ramsay. We give it up.
Business done.—None.
Tuesday Night.—Peers terrible fellows to work when once begin.
Only yesterday Bill brought in dealing with election of Scotch Peers:
to-day Lord Galloway brings in another.

"The Chamberlain Light."
"If things go on at this rate," I say to Lord Redesdale, "your
Lordship will have to retire to Cannes for a week or two."
"No, Toby," says Chairman of Committees, "I '11 die at my post.
There's a good many, including Salisbury, who would like to hear
I was off to Cannes or anywhere else out of the way. Some of the
young Peers, too, are inclined to be fractions, and sneer at my little
ways. But I know what I owe my country, and I '11 pay it to the
uttermost snarl. The country's going to the dogs, (no offence to
you, Toby); but as long as I can hold it back I '11 hang on."
In House of Commons, Mr. John Morley, Elect of Newcastle -on-
Tyne, enters amid thunderous applause. House knows a good man
when it sees him, and here, take him all in all, is the best that has
arrived since bye-elections began. Took an opportunity, when the
crowd had departed, of giving him a little advice.
"There's a good deal expected of you here, my Jo-John, which is
a bad thing to start with. A man might as conveniently walk up
to table to take the oath with a millstone round his neck, as with
special reputation earned outside. You '11 have to fight hard against
your own reputation. There is one help to victory, simple and effi-
cacious. Whatever happens, under any provocation, don t open your
lips to speak this Session. By next year the House will nave got
used to your presence. You will be John Morley, M.P. If you
make good speech, you will be one of us, and that will be all right.
If you speak in first Session, you are still outsider, and will be dealt
with as Buch. Deal of human nature here, John, including preva-
lence of the 'arf-a-briok principle when we see a stranger, especially

if he's made a name outside and thinks he's coming here to crow
over us."
J. M. made note of these remarks. Promised to think them over.
Business done.—Still roaming round the Address, with little inter-
ludes touching Eilmainham Treaty. Odd word "Kilmainham."
Richard Power says so oalled because inconvenient questions con-
nected with it Can't be Killed.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Still on the Address. More than a little
tired of it. Irish Members not managed with the old success in
giving it appearance of reality. Got a shock last Monday that
settled me for week. Didn't mention it at the time, being ashamed of
my own weakness; but may as well make clean breast.
Came in whilst Mr. O'Brien, the latest messenger of peace from
Ireland, was on his legs. Much struck with manifest earnestness of
the man. With hands olenched, teeth set, and eyes flashing under
overhanging brow, he literally wrestled with his thoughts. Words
well ohosen, carefully enunciated; seemed as if he had other things
to say, but recognised his position and the place, and after infinite
struggle, kept back phrases that would bring down on him reproof
from Chair.
Still, words sufficiently burning and not without reason. Was
talking about the memorable massacre at Maamstresna. A helpless
family butchered in the night by cowardly ruffians, who deliberately
set forth to accomplish the infamy. Neither grey hairs nor infant
cries regarded. All butchered in their beds, the skulking murderers
making off in dead of night, and long eluding justice. O'Brien's
frame trembled with honest indignation aB he spoke of it. A little
puzzled to hear him denouncing the Irish Executive and the present
Chief Secretary. But that, I suppose, is the way of Irishmen. Only
just came in whilst O'Brien hissing forth through olenched teeth his
honest indignation. Dare say he was commenting on length of time
that elapsed between murder and conviction. Lowther standing by |
me at the Bar listening.
"There, James, you see," I said to him, "these fellows aren't all
hardened. Here's O'Brien, who speaks strongly enough on political
questions, comes out like a man when murder's the matter. This
powerful denunciation of the murderers of the Joyce family will surely
have good effect in Ireland."
"BahI Young Innocence," said James, turning on his heel.
"It's not the murders he 'a lamenting, but the hanging of the
murderers."
And so it was, as I learned on fuller inquiry. These clenched
hands, this quivering body, these flashing eyes, and this passionate
voice all for the men who skulked by night, and, in fancied
security, slew the helpless family! Not a word of regret for the
victims. Only bitter denunciation for Judge, Jury, and Executive
that hanged the murderers. This seems to give one enough of Irish
Members for one week.
Business done.—Put another spoke in wheel of the Address.
Thursday.—Quite affecting scene at witching hour of midnight.

speech of excellent feeling and taste. Lord ITartington said some
things both pleasing and true, and Sir Stafford Northcote having
gone home, not knowing affair coming off, Sclateh-Booth spoke on
behalf of Opposition. So, amid salvos of cheering, Lyon retired
from the Treasury Bench, and went to lie down with the lambs be-
hind. Sir Charles Fobster affected to tears.
Fancy conscience of some of the gentlemen on the Opposition
benches must have been ruffled as they cheered. Have always said,
and will always stick to it, that Platfair hadn't Fair-play. He
held Chair in exceptionally troublesome times, and a dead Bet was
made against him from below the Oangway opposite.
Got through debate at last, after luminous speech from Asuuead-
B artlett, from which I gather that things are looking bad abroad
and rather shaky at home.
"Wonderful man, A.-B.," I say to Sir C. Dilke. "Such a grasp
of the situation. Sees everything whether at home or abroad."
"So he ought," said Sir Charles. "He's Member for Eye."
Fancy Dilke was sneering. But A.-B. had just mentioned that
when Under Foreign Secretary, Dilke had " succeeded in failing in
everything."
Business done.—Address disposed of.
Friday Night.—Ireland again, of course, though Address is passed
through all stages. But this time Ireland usefully. Mr. O'Shaugh-
nessy brings in Resolution pledging House to agree to compulsory
education for Ireland. Trevelyan accepts on part of the Govern-
ment. This is to be the Coercion Bill for next year. The best of
long series.

As Mrs. Ramsbotham would put it, "Modesty is always the best

responsibility, seems determined to act up to the spirit of the good
old familiar proverb.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FIRST-RATE CARDS.

The Queen of Hearts and the Ace.
[Her Majesty has stated that she is greatly pleased with the photograph
of Miss Jbssib Act, both as a work of Art and as a memento of a noble act.]
AMATEUR ACTORS OFF THE LINE.
[To the Editor.)
Very bear Sir,
Ik the coarse of the correspondence about Sir Percy
Shelley's Theatre, Mr. Horace Wigan declared that the Hon.
Slinusuy Bkthkll made no objection to the performances so long as
he was taking a personal part in them. To this Mr. Bbthell replied
he had only played once, and then had been fitted with "a very
humble part without lines." The Hon. Gentleman seemed to think
that a non-speaking role was beneath his dignity as a distinguished
non-professional Actor of. many years' standing. Surely the Hon.
Gentleman was wrong, as a thoughtful Amateur can take the smallest
possible character, and with a little earnest attention " invest it with
considerable artistic merit." As I have spent the greater part of a
long life in considering the "very humble parts " of the recognised
Amateur Drama, a few extracts from my note-book may prove
acceptable as illustrating my meaning, and serving as a collection of
useful examples to the persevering student in the same line.
Lady oj' Lyons.—Part of Third Officer. Object of Introduction.—
To talk with enthusiasm of the rapid promotion of Claude Melnotte.
Conventional Rendering.—To dress him as a very young man, and
to make him speak with enthusiasm. Recommended Improved
Rendering.—To cause him to utter the words, "Promotion is very
rapid in the French Army—I was made a lieutenant yesterday," in
a quavering voice, tremulous from extreme old age. Dress him as an
ancient officer, with long white hair and sunken cheeks. He should
support himself with a long stuff, be troubled with rheumatism, and
be subject to a "churchyard cough." Rip Van Winkle, after his
long sleep, will serve as an excellent type upon which the Third
Officer may be modelled. Played with careful attention to detail, he
is sure to prove effective.
A Sheep in Wolfe Clothtng.—Tirt of John Zoyland the Black-
smith. Object of Introduction.—To break open a door in a cup-
board in whioh a proscribed cavalier is supposed to be concealed,
in the presence of his heart-broken wife and household and his
military pursuers. Conventional Rendering.—To come in dressed
as an ordinary workman, and, after breaking open the cupboard,
retire quietly. Recommeded Improved Rendering.—To enter in
holiday costume. _ It is his birthday, and consequently he has been
"keeping it up " in the usual manner. He tries to kiss the maid-
servant, and salutes Colonel Percy Kirk, who is present to arrest
the proscribed traitor, with comic obsequiousness. Next he can't
find the cupboard, and begins to nail up a wrong door. Set right,
he does his work in the leisurely and inaccurate fashion common
amongst the inebriated. Ultimately he insists in dumb show upon
being paid, and pantomimically expresses his contempt at the
smallness of his remuneration to all the characters in succession,
giving special attention to the heart-broken wife. Played with
spirit, this little part should be one of the "features'' of the
performance.
Plot and Passion.—Part of officer in charge of troops. Object of
Introduction.—To arrest M. Fouchi at the instigation of Berthier,
Prince of Neufchdtel, and in the presence of Marie (heroine of the
pieoe), her lover, and Desmarets, a police spy, at the end of the Third
Act. Conventional Rendering.—To stand at the back of the stage in
one position until the fall of the Curtain. Recommended Improved
Rendering.—To remember that, as an officer of a crack.regiment
stationed at'Paris, he would certainly have met all the characters
present in general society. Consequently, he should approach Marie
and gallantly kiss her hand, offer snuff to her lover, ana strike Des-
marett playfully, but scornfully, with the flat of his sword. Should
he have time before the fall of the Curtain to do more, he may use-
fully employ his leisure in whispering to the Prince de Neufchdtel
a " good story " with gesticulation suggestive of limitless merriment.
Played in this fashion, this very subordinate part will not be easily
forgotten.
The Bengal Tiger.—Part of one of the Indian attendants upon Sir
Paul Pagoda. Object of Introduction.—To bring in a snuff-box.
Conventional Rendering.—To wait in complete repose for the orders
of his master, and then to obey them without attracting attention.
Recommended Improved Rendering.—To bear in mind that as pro-
bably the Indian attendant was a prince in his own country, he
should wear the most gorgeous costume, jewelled turban, robe of
gold, diamond-hilted scimitar, &o. Sir Paul would permit this
dress, as, having the supreme oontempt of old-fashioned Anglo-
Indians for "niggers," he would regard the apparel of his servant
with oold indifference. If the attendant had royal blood in his veins,
he would at every command of his master half draw his sword, ana
then, by a mighty act of self-repression, control himself. He would,
no doubt, be a Buddhist, and consequently, when he had no better
employment, he would usefully fill up his time in worshipping a
small idol he would carry about with him. Finally, at the end of
the piece, finding the drudgery of having to hand a snuff-box about
to an irritable old gentleman too much for him, he would commit
sensational suicide with a knife or a pistol. Thus played, the little
part would stand out from other little parts in bold relief.
And now I think I have written enough to show that Mr. Bethell
was wrong to write disparagingly of a very humble part " without
lines." AH that is wanted in improving such a character is bold-
ness and the courage of your opinions. Your innovations are not
likely to be very popular with your fellow-actors. But what of
that r Professional jealousy is, as everyone knows, the rule, and not
the exception. And remember if the worst comes to the worst, you
can always run for your life, and the police are bound to proteot
you.

1 p.m.—Opposed an application

the case was opened for the Plain-

shaky, but was cleverly picked
up and prompted by a bright

Just trying the stops and keys,

Might be got to work with ease:
By ear, with my notes in my

Performing—as few men can,
I struck such a chord that the
organ
Burst out "You're a Grand

It flooded the daily papers,
Like the name of a comic song,
And I felt several inches taller
As I quietly bowled along.
I think that it nettled N o rt n cote,
Polite as he can be in strife,
Though it seemed a sensible echo
From the din of my Public life.
But it brought down chair by the
cartload,
That possibly may increase;—
For till Churchill 'b in with his
Party,
I never shall know any peace.
But I take the whole thing calmly,
For the chord has a swell that's
fine;
And I'm glad the popular organ
Has a touch that answers mine.
And whether I stick to the Com-
mons,—
And I certainly will if I can,—
Or go to the Peers,—no matter,
I shall still hear "that Grand

POETRY OF THE SCOTTISH PEERAGE.
San Dir., strike up! A flourish on the Bagpipes!
It seems that there are, or till lately were, two Earldoms of Mar,
a senior and junior Earldom; the Earldom of Mar pure and simple,
and the Earldom of Mar and Kellie. The latter was created by
Mary Queen of Soots; the creation of the former prehistoric; its
date "iost in antiquity," perhaps but a little subsequent to the
general creation—if that may be alluded to without offence to
evolutionists.
The two Earldoms are said to have been contemplated by one
claimant, who claimed both of them, as forming a sort of compound
Earldom. He contended that the junior Earldom, with its limita-
tion to the male line, is superimposed upon, but does not destroy
or supersede the senior, and that whilst the heir male is at liberty to
call himself Earl of Mar and Kellte, he, as heir general, inherits
from his mother the original title of Earl of Mar. Thus regarded—
"The peerage is conceived as consisting of two layers, to the upper part of
which the Earldom of Kellie has been joined, but the lower and more ancient
of which remains unaffected by chance ana change, and follows the laws
inherent in its nature."
According to this view of its twofold composition, how remarkably
does the Earldom of Mar (Scotch) resemble the Black Grouse (Scotch
also) whose flesh (as we all know, don't we f) is divided into two
layers, dark meat one of them and the other white. What a pleasing
analogy, thinks the epicure and the Scotchman—for there are now-
a-days at least Scotch as well as " English epioures," by your leave,
Macbeth.
Here allow a countryman of Burns to observe, with all due defer-
ence to Swift, Pope, and Arbuthnot, that every genuine Soot must
decidedly object to Martinus Scriblbrus's celebrated illustration
of an anticlimax:—
"And thou, Dalhousy, the great god of war,
Lieutenant-Colonel to the Earl of Mak."
However great the god of war may have been in the ages of
mythology, a greater must be acknowledged in an Earl the creation
of whose Earldom had long preoeded them. No, very Reverend Sir.
No, Gentlemen. There is no drop, there is no plunge, there is no
bathos whatever, in putting " Mars" after "Mar." Eh, Sirs, no
anticlimax at all; but iust the reverse. The Earl of Mar was a
Generalissimo undeniably fit and proper to be the commanding
officer of even Mars himsel'.

LLANDONTNO.
A week ago a party of five Spring tourists set out from this plaoe,
intending to make the ascent of Snowdon by a devious, dangerous,
and inaccessible route. They were described as Londoners, who were
utterly unacquainted with mountaineering. Nothing has since been
heard of them, and the worst fears are consequently entertained.
Two young men, accompanied by two young women, hired a boat
yesterday, in spite of the warnings of the boatman that it was only
constructed to carry two persons with safety. The party—none of
whom could swim—was observed through telesoopes to be " skylark-
ing" in the frail craft. Their bodies have not yet been reoovered.
Weather generally bright and clear when not pouring with rain and
violently stormy.
LITTLE PEDDLINGTON.
Sir Pursey Numseull, M.P., yesterday addressed his constituents
on the Local Option question. Temperance, he remarked, was an
excellent thing in its way, if not carried too far. Education, also,
was an excellent thing. If our population did not drink so much, it
was probable they would be more sober, while there could be little
doubt, from statistics recently published, that one great oause of the
ignorance which so largely prevailed, was the lack of education
among the masses. A vote of confidence in the Hon. Baronet was
carried by acclamation. Weather variable.
HAN WELL.
A local Gentleman, who wrote to every Cabinet and ex-Cabinet
Minister, asking what steps the Government proposed to take to put
down the propagation of Mormonism in England, has received some
interesting replies. Mr. Gladstone's Secretary says, "The Prkmikb
begs to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, and wishes me
to say, in answer, that, in his opinion, the Floods Prevention
Bill should become law before anything can be done." Mr.
Bright writes—" Your letter has remained some time unanswered,
because I fail to eee any reason why such a question should be
addressed to me. I may say, however, that I hope the people of this
country will use the remedy of force—though force, as a rule, is no
remedy—against any Mormon proselytisers who may attempt to gain
a public hearing." Weather lovely at night, and full moon out all
day.
SWTLLINQTON.
Six colliers were sentenced to terms of penal servitude, at the
Assizes here, for savage assaults on their wives. The new Bishopric
Fund is making rapid progress. Canon Silvertongue preaohed an
eloquent sermon, yesterday, to a crowded congregation, on Chaldaio
Weights and Measures. To-day, several leading grocers of the town
were fined small sums, for selling flour largely adulterated with
Plaster of Paris, and chalk from some disused pits in the neighbour-
hood. Weather boisterous and rough. Glass going up. Several
glasses going up.
MUFFBOROUaH.
Two oases of English cholera are reported here, and the Salvation
Army are reported to be coming shortly. Three men, with jemmies
and skeleton keys were disoovered, last night, on the premises of a
provision merchant. Their pockets were filled with tea, ooffee, and
East Indian pickles, while a couple of carts and a wheel-barrow
were waiting outside, half-filled with tinned meats and bottles of
Gilbet's sherry. It is suspeoted that the men intended to commit a
burglary. The Local Police are making inquiries, previous to
apprehending the suspected individuals. Atmosphere dull and hazy.
Land fogs.
NEGLECTED MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.
My bear P.,

My bold Ophicleide is as good as it's bold,
It gleams in the sun with the glitter of gold I

And frighten my foes, or will sing to my love!
'Tis soothing and sweet, and it can't be denied,
No tone is so fine as my bold Ophicleide!
'Tis stern and commanding, 'tis gleesome and
bland,
Superb as a solo, divine in a band:
When windows are open in sweet summer night,
How blithely I blow, to the neighbours' delight!
And, if I feel weary, I just step inside,
And drop off to sleep in my bold Ophioleide I

That is fit to compare with my trusty Trombone I
Let other folks go out to danoe or to dine,
And talk too much nonsense and take too much wine;

I '11 comfort myself with my crisp Kettledrum I
What sweet modulation on drums may be made,
From wild battle-crash to the love serenade:
When evenings are long and there's nothing to do,
'Tis soothing, most soothing, to beat a tattoo.

HE UNIVERSITIES' BOAT-RACE.
A8 IT MIGHT, COULD, SHOULD, OR OUGHT TO BE.
OUR FUTURE LORD MAYOR.
November dth, 1883.—So I am the first Lord Mayor of the grand new
Municipality of London! Proud position. "Westminster, Lord
Mayor of London!" Populaoe seem pleased at my appearance.
Wonder what the " City Magnates" will think of a Duke as their
Chief Magistrate. Must try and he very affable.
At Mansion. House.—Curious, City Magnates all seem dreadfully
afraid of me. Wonder if I ought to send for Loving Cup at once.
Wonder what old Lord Mayors did to make themselves popular.
Must get Firth to coach me up in this. Procession to-day, at all
events, shall be a tremendous success. Determined to show London
the difference between a Mayor who's only a " City snob," to use a
vulgar expression which Firth is constantly using, and a real
live Duke. My new State-coach, with sixteen performing elephants
harnessed to it, will take the populaoe, I rather fancy. Thoughtful
of me to have secured services of all Madame Tussaud's wax-work
figures to sit in carriages, dressed like Sheriffs.
Twelve o' Clock.—Time for Procession to start. Feel nervous. Why-
should a Lord Mayor wear these ridiculous " robes of office " ? Wish
Gladstone had inserted a clause in his Act, allowing me to appear
inordinary morning-coat on all State occasions. Also find the Ducal
Coronet troublesome; shouldn't have put it on, only Firth insisted
that populace would smash windows of new State Coach, if I didn't.
Five o' Clock.—Show not quite as great a success as I expected.
Elephants turned out rather refractory somewhere up in Canonbury.
Was obliged to extend old route, to please ratepayers of "Larger
London ;made it include Hammersmith, Croydon, Hampstead,
Greenwich, and back down Edgeware Road. Rather tiring. Men in
armour mutinied in Shad well, and refused to goon without an hour's
reBt and money for refreshments. Took opportunity to jrat robes
and coronet on one of Madame Tussaud's figures, stuck him in the
State Coach, and had a quiet snooze at the bottom of the carriage.
At Hampstead, band struck. Provoking!
Attitude of populace on the whole satisfactory. Don't, however,
quite know if they were cheering Alderman and Sheriff Bradlat/gh,
or myself. Street-boys also don't seem to understand new order of
things. Stopped my coach several times, and explained to them
that I was not an ordinary Lord Mayor, and that the new Munici-
pality was entirely distinct from the old City.
Evening.—Dinner to Her Majesty's Ministers. Thank Heaven,
this will be an occasion on which they can't help feeling difference
between a nobleman and a "City nob" (as Firth says). Wonder
who all those peculiarly-dressed females are? Am just giving orders
to have them turned out as intruders, when Firth whispers to me
that they are the relatives of the new Aldermen. Heavens! Forgot
that new Aldermen were elected by ratepayers. They have come
from a "new social stratum," too. Why should Wapping have
insisted on returning Bradlaugh at head of the poll? There he is!
Isn't there an oath for an Alderman and Sheriff, I wonder? If so,
might manage to exclude him.
"the office
Everybody who's got a grievance comes to me. Have received in two
days deputations from Society for Spread of Sensational Literature,
Society for Suppression of Smoking, the League for the Total and
Unconditional Conversion of Mahometan Costermongers, the Skeleton
Army, the Salvation Ditto, the Timbuetoo Famine Relief Committee,
the Ratepayers' Lynch-law Committee, and the Council of the
"Working-men's Channel Tunnel and Proletariat Balloon Sooiety."
"Nationalisation of Land Society " just sent a deputation to ask
me to lend Egyptian Chamber of Mansion House for a meeting to
denounce rents! Very insulting. Refused politely. Deputation
seemed annoyed. Said the "new Municipality was democratic, and
Mansion House belonged to the people." Really this sort of thing
very irritating. Some people don't seem to know the difference
between a Duke and a spectacle-maker.
After a Fortnight.-— Felt that the new order of things meant cessa-
tion of old extravagant style of Aldermanic banquets. So roBe to
occasion, and gave strict orders to limit the wine to one bottle of our
fine new brand of " Municipality Champagne," at five-and-sixpence
a dozen. Also have had turtle-soup diluted with half-and-half best
Thames water, from which " animal organisms" have been pretty
well excluded by filtration.
Waiters Btrike " en masse " just before banquet to Serene Highness
Emperor of Saskatchewan! Awkward. Must dissemble. Am
extremely affable to waiters, and get them to promise to come back
"for one night certain " on promise that I won't keep what's left
from to-night's banquet till next one a week henoe.
Fancy Dress Ball laBt night. Aldermanic representative of Seven
Dials brought a whole host of relatives. Obliged to retire at an early
period of evening to cellars, where I enjoyed quiet glass of splendid
Madeira, laid down by dear old Corporation, in company with Firth.
Firth says he thinks new Municipality is not "going" quite as
well as he expeoted. I reply, that I wish it were gone altogether.
He rather agrees with me. We both slip out by back-door, and off
to Grosvenor House, where I have a regular jolly evening, the first
sinoe I was elected Lord Mayor.
February.—Hurrah 1 8hower of snow at last. Now will show
populace what they gain by a grand Municipality. Been waiting
for this opportunity all the winter. Had men in readiness night
and day, to sweep every thoroughfare perfectly clean in two hours!
Result disappointing. Men thought winter was over, and have, it
appears, deserted posts. Got in amateur sweepers, at extra cost.
About twenty thousand men, and five thousand waggons. Expense,
I am afraid, enormous. Snow all carted into Thames, and causes
disastrous flood. Angry deputation from inhabitants of flooded
houses waits on me at Mansion House. Refuse to see them. Amateur
sweepers run away with the Municipality's brooms and carts. Just
got snow well cleared away at oost of some thousands to ratepayers,
when down it comes again, worse than ever I
Next Bay.—Resign post. Tell Gladstone to give it to a soap-
boiler. Old "social stratum" much the best for this sort of thing.
Go off to Cannes with Firth, to recuperate, and try and forget the
disagreeable half-year I ever spent in my life.

"A STARVING DOCTOR."
"Many valuable lives might be preserved if
we had the courage to face the accusation of
being, aa I am, a starving doctor."—Dr. Andrew
Clark in The Mrilish Medical Journal.
Now list we all to Andrew Clark,
And what he says on eating,
Though haply each severe remark,
Will set some puIbob beating.
He raves, in his peculiar style,
'Gainst gormandising sinners,
And bids us eat plain teas the while,
And purely phantom dinners.
Farewell to every neat entree,
To sweet and subtle sauces;
No piquant ragout from to-day
MuBt titivate your fauces.
In what then can you seek relief,
Although you 're not a glutton?
Here's Doctor Clark forbids you beef,
And scorns the thought of mutton.
He says at breakfast take, I beg,
Some tea and bread-and-butter;
He '11 just allow one single egg.
A mercy that, you mutter.
At midday he would have you dine,
On fish, on wings of chickens,
A plain milk pudding, and no wine—
And that's the very "dickens!"
At five or six o'clock you've tea,
The breakfast fare repeated,
A tiny bit of fish maybe,
Then, lo! your meals completed.
And if to all his rules you bow,
Eaoh invitation scorning.
One glass of water he '11 allow,
At night and in the morning.
Such is the fare—no longer can
The gastronome run riot.

Of physio you 're concocter:

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

PARLIAMENTARY AND THEATRICAL "AT HOME" IN DOWNING STREET.

came up smiling, having given knock-down blow to Father Time,
who has been reminding him he is seventy-four. Drove from
Downing Street through crowd of admirers. Wanted to put on his
mask, to show them how he did it at Nice. Mrs. Gladstone wouldn't
hear of it. Would look frivolous, she said. Besides there was no
need of it out-of-doors. When he got inside, Randolph and the rest
would doubtless be throwing mud at him, when he might put it on
if he liked. Meantime, if he'd only give his collar an extra hitch
up, it would answer all purposes of a mask.
G. 0. M. assented, put on his fur pelisse, shook an extra reef out of
the mainsail on either side of his face, and looked quite picturesque.
"Still under pelisse protection," I said, touching the coat lest he
shouldn't see the joke. (Tiresome to have to explain jokes.)
"Ah, Tobt, there you are!" he cried. "And if it's a fur ques-
tion, How have you been?"
This oomes of sitting on a knife-board, as Mr. Raises puts it.
Sharper than ever. I could hardly keep up with him as he walked
along the passage, across the lobby, and so into House, where received
with great cheering. Immense brightening up on Conservative side.
Randolph radiant.
"Most miserable fortnight ever spent in Parliament," he says.
"Might as well try to draw a quarter's salary in advance or the line
between Ashmead-Babtlett and Chaplin as try to draw Habtino-
ton. But here's this Grand yet Childish Old Man baok amongst us,
and 1 '11 have him out before we are forty minutes older."
So he did, though Babttelot caught him first, and got out a speech
on Egypt. Randolph, little later, drew him on Transvaal, which,
with one or two minor speeches, was pretty well for first night.
Amusing display of Conservative force just before Gladstone
arrived. Conservative minority increased by six-feet-four-and-a-
half. Mr. Brewster, who owns these inches, took his seat for
Portarlington. Walked up to Table between Tottenham and
King-Habman, mere striplings of six-feet-three.
"Let's see 'em beating that!" said Sir William Dtke, rubbing
his hands. "If they lick us in length of figures in the Division
Lobby, they shan't on the floor of the House."
Liberals try to hide their discomfiture under sneers.
"The smaller the Borough, the bigger the Member," says Mr.
Woodall.
"Beewsteb should be the Constituency, and Portarlington should
represent him here," says Mr. Brand.
Some talk of Mr. Cotes accepting the Chiltern Hundreds, going
down for re-election, coming back, and being introduced by Mr.
Whitehead and Arthur Guest.
"That'd make 'em look blue," sayB Lord Richard Geosvenor
cheerily. Business done.—Votes in Supply.
Tuesday.—House of Commons properly jealous of interference of
Peers with their procedure, whether at election time or otherwise.
Lord Carinoton threatened with dire displeasure, because he is
reported to have invited "the notables "of Wycombe to a little
entertainment at Wycombe Abbey, after writ had been issued for
new election of Borough Member.
Contrast with this the indifference, or, rather, pleasure, with
whioh the House permits interference of another member of the
Peerage with its procedure. When a certain Count (said to be of
Polish extraction) visits the House, and autocratically upsets its pro-
cedure, we don't hear any high talk about interference of other House.
Nobody proposes to raise a Constitutional question about Count Out.
He looked in to-night about half-past eight. Bundled Speaker out
of Chair, drove Members forth, ordered Captain Gosset to "take away
the bauble" from the table, and had the whole place straightway
shut up. Pride's Purge nothing to peremptory action of the Count.
Randolph riled because he had Motion down about Endowed
Schools in Ireland. Wanted to show how interests of these had
suffered whilst Gladstone frittering his time away at Cannes. But
Randolph helpless before the omnipotent Count who promises to be
the last of the Peers. Only pity is he didn't ap-peer earlier on the
scene. No one would have suffered, and many patient persons
would have benefited if the noble Lord had turned up with regu-
larity at half-past seven on every night Address was debated.
Business done.—House Counted Out at half-past Eight.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Quite a lively debate on Mr. Ander-
son's Bill to put down Pigeon-shooting. At one time seemed
to touch the domain of tragedy. Mr. Fobsteb, supporting
Bill, said he'd "never shot a fellow-creature but once." ThriR of
horror ran through the House at expected disclosures. Parnellites
Sricked up their ears. Joseph Gillis, momentarily awaking from
epresBion, cried '' Hear! hear!"
"Always thought there was some great mystery about Forster,"
Joseph remarked to Captain O'Shea, the confidential adviser and
Father Confessor of the party. "Why does he never brush his hair?
Can you tell me that. O'Shat? Is it remorse, or a vow of penance?"
"—Never shot a fellow-creature but once," Mr. Forster continued,
"and that was a cat."
Irish Members disappointed, and_ House generally relieved. But
Forster mustn't recklessly and without notice make jokes of this
kind. House not used to it.
Pleasant to see Sir Herbert Maxwell ask Mr. Anderson to con-
sider the question from the point of view of the Pigeon. "Suppose
you were a Blue Rock, now," says the Hon. Baronet, regarding Mr.
Andebson with head suggestively on one side. Ordinary imagination
could not fly so high. Member for Glasgow too massive for the part.
Sir Walter Babttelot monstrous mysterious, and more than
ever emphatic.
"If you pass Bills like these," says he, "Country Gentlemen will
be driven to live in London; and a more misohievous thing I cannot
imagine."
"I wants to make yer flesh oreep," said the Fat Boy to the Deaf
Lady who lived at Dingley Dell. Might have added, had he known

Lord Randolph Churchill pities the Pigeons at Monte Carlo.
Thursday.—Joseph Gillis came down about ten o'clock. Thought
he'd be crushed, and, like a timid fawn, undesirous of human society.
Would have passed him by pretending not to see him. But J. B.
was not at all like that. Came along with his accustomed lithe step
and with the familiar smile on his too seductive countenance.
"Didn't see you in Court to-day ^ Toby," says he, as if it was
Mr. Forster who had been on trial. "Great crush, a little
perhaps you were as well out of it."
"Ah! Joseph, what a man you are," I said. "When we were
speculating on your visit to Paris, wondering what it would lead to,
how far the Constitution would be shattered, and whether the Throne
was safe, you were philandering in the mazes of the Bon Marche,
buying boots and things, and casting golden chains around coy
maidenhood."
"Coy, is it F" said Joseph, with his serene smile. "Bedad, she
was always renewing her application, I know I'm a little powerful
with the female sex. 1 warned her at first, but it was no use. She
was always after proposing to me."
"It has from remote ages been the fate of Joseph to be thus pur-
sued. You must be careful in future. A man of your fascinations
should be generous."
"Begorra," said Joseph, and an expression of pain flitted over
his countenance. "I have to be generous whether I will or no.
There's four hundred pounds to pay, besides
oosts. Tell you what, Toby, I ll go into a

how O'BRiEir, in his Paper, has similarly

Mr. Burke, Mr. Justice Lawson, and Mr.
Field. House listens and reflects, not
without thrill of emotion. Sextos loudly

about his "honourable friend."

RECKLESS WRITING AND CARELESS PUFFING.
The art of Theatrical Advertising is progressing. The Publio has
now for some time grown familiar with the famous Couple of master-
pieces in one evening " put forward as an attraction to wheedle it
within the walls of the Adelphi. It has, moreover, had the privilege
of dwelling on the sanitary considerations urged upon it with so much
grace and foroe by the Bamumian genius who presides at the Savoy.
Then there has been the splendid tone of confidence suggested by a
reference to_ the Drury Lane "takings,"—to say nothing of the
latest effort in the puffing line made bya gentleman who appears to
have approached the Management of Her Majesty's, not only ani-
mated with excellent intentions, but gifted with complete-letter-
writing powers of really a high order.
And all these signs of the times are encouraging. But an Actor
and Manager of Mr. Toole's reputation should be more cautious in
the selection of his cuttings from newspaper criticisms than to quote
the following lines from a notice which purports to have appeared in
the Daily Chronicle, which, in mentioning H. J. Byron's Uncle
Dick's Darling, says :—
"Humorous and lively to the last, these comedies offend no taste; but,
pure in tone, thought, and expression, stand, and will stand, as mementos of
ono English playwright who was content to find his effects away from the
dangerous ground of immoral intrigue, blasphemy, and swearing."
There is no occasion to remark on the above brief commentary
further than to point out that, if itself pure in tone, thought,
and expression, and humorous and lively to the last, unlike the
comedies to which it referred, it was scarcely so fortunate on the
score of good taste. The inference, undoubtedly, is that there are
Dramatic Authors, who, unlike the Author of Uncle Dick's Darling,
are accustomed to "find their effects" in "immoral intrigue,
blasphemy, and swearing." Surely Mr. Toole himself would
be the last person to corroborate suoh a sweeping assertion, for it
would be as bad as saying that many of the pieces he had appeared
in, have been essentially immoral, blasphemous, and profane.
Were this indictment true, the several guilty members of the
Dramatic Authors' Society should have their dramatic pieces de con-
viction brought against them as damning evidence, ana be sentenced
to the same punishment as the Editor of the Freethinker is now
undergoing. _ The quotation, whatever may have been the context
in the original, is an aspersion on the fair fame of English
Dramatists who, as a rule, have been so careful to avoid everything
approaching immoral intrigue, that when any one of them has had
to adapt a risky French piece, he has chosen rather to incur blame
and the chance of failure, by toning down and removing whatever
immoral motive there might be, to achieving success by closely
adhering to the original. Moreover, such a very nasty one levelled
at contemporary literature was also extremely hard upon that
worthy and most proper functionary, the Lord Chamberlain.
However, Mr. Toole has already struck it out of his advertise-
ment, and it speaks well for his judgment that he has done so. But
the paragraph in question has naturally suggested on all sides loud
cries of "Name?"
LOVE AND LAW.
Dear Mr. Punch.
I perceive by the papers that a person named Cahie^ pro-
poses the Abolition of Actions for Breach of Promise of Marriage 1
Proposes, indeed 1 The wretch!! Are we poor women to be
robbed of one of our few protections against
the flattering falseness of the "proposing"
sex P Not that men " propose " too muoh. On
the contrary. I maintain that, as by social
convention, if not by law, they have a mono-
poly of the right of proposing," they should
be compelled, by law, to exercise that right
more fully than they do. An exclusive privilege
inadequately used is at once an insult and an
injury to the unprivileged. That's logic, I
hope, and good enough for Girton or The
Nineteenth Century. Caihe's proposal—fancy
being proposed to by a man with that name!
—is preposterous, of course. If men propose,
they must—well, take the consequences in the
fullest sense. Matrimony, or money down!
But can nothing be done with those who won't
propose, who won't even woo? Marriage they shun, and courting
they seem to despise. Could they not be prosecuted for "Contempt
of Court" f That, I maintain, would—as the Daily News says the
Lord Chancellor's New Bill does not—" go very far towards putting
Contempt of Court upon a proper basis." Do see to it, there's a
dear Grand Old Man, and you will confer a real favour—a wedding
favour—on Yours devotedly,
Belinda Blissless.

THE EMPIRE IN DANGER AGAIN!
"It is impossible to overstate the indignation existing in India on the
subject of Lord Bipon's Criminal Amendment Bill."—Daily Paper.
What the Indians or Anglo-Indians really think about the matter
is possibly something like this:—
Lord Ripon. Must really try and recollect that I'm a Liberal
Viceroy. Why not introduoe some reforms before I retire P Here's
Kimberley telegraphing that English Radicals are very discontented,
and " can't I do something to please them P" So I must adapt "the
theories of the Magazines and the principles of the Caucus " to India,
I suppose. Hope Gladstone will be satisfied, I'm sure; there '11
be a perfect howl out here! Here goes with a Bill allowing Native
Magistrates to try Europeans in country districts. Ilbbrt says it's
all right. Ilhkut is a lawyer, and he ought to know. If there's a
tremendous row, I can call it an experiment, and withdraw it quietly.
The Anglo-Indian Captain Sahib.—Gave Ramchunder, my
IS hue sty, one on the Bide of his head this morning for bringing
several disgusting frogs, alive, from the pond in the water for my
bath. Didn't hurt Ramchunder a bit. What does the fellow do
but rush out of my bungalow, and take out a summons against me
for assault! Never heard such impudence in my life. Am told the
reason is that they 've got a "Native Magistrate " appointed, who is
severe on Sahibs who knock their servants about. What is the
country coming to, I should like to know? It '11 be awkward if I'm
fined by the brute. Hope they won't mention in Court about Jem-
sktjee, that "Punkah-Wallah" whom I touched up with a gentle
kick, and who was so inconsiderate as to go out into the Compound
and expire soon afterwards. When old Smith, of the I.C.8., was
our Beak, he never took any notice of those little things. Times
have indeed changed. Must remember only to kick the niggers in
future when I have my slippers on.
Our Vakeel (or Native Advocate). Lord Ripon is a resplendent
Viceroy 1 He knows what is justice for the poor despised Hindoo.
Old Baboo will be an ever to much better Magistrate than Smith
Sahib. Never could produce much effect on Smith Sahib. Only
time I ever offered him a bribe—it was a Lac of Rupees, too—he
actually threatened to kiok me out of his tent! Such oppression is
unbearable. Now we shall have some of the good old corrupt days
baok again. Glad that I am so much richer than that Chowringhee,
the rival Vakeel. Where will Chowrinohee be now, I wonder?
Smith Sahib used to like Chowrinohee. That was because the dog
never offered Smith Sahib a bribe. Chowringhee hasn't the money
to do it with! But I have. Let us then beg the Queen to permit
us to have Lord Ripon just five years longer I Who knows whether
we shan't in that time be locking up all the Sahibs in gaol, without
the option of a fine, for eating Cow t
The Anglo-Tory Politician. Here's another abominable blow at
our glorious Empire J Chamberlain's at the bottom of it, I '11 be
bound. He always is, if there's any mischief to be done anywhere.
Hear that Ripon receives daily telegrams from the Radical Caucus
at Birmingham! Hear also (Tommy told me this at the Club as
"perfectly authentic") that the Government is seriously contem-
plating proclaiming total independence of India at once, also of all
our other Colonies, and granting unlimited Home Rule to Ireland!
Gladstone (Tommy said) feels he's "breaking up," and wants to
break up something else first, and so is trying his hand at the British
Empire. Evidently Ripon'b measure about Native Magistrates is
the thin end of the wedge. Don't quite know details of the Bill,
but suppose it's to abolish all English Judges in India, and put
Hindoos in their place. At least, so Tommy said, and he is sure to
know, because his uncle's father had a cousin who was Governor or
something at Madras, or Seringapatam, or somewhere out there.

Canterbury in Bow Church.
We thought he had been con-
firmed lone ago when a boy;
however, better late than
never. But what we want to
know is, what is that bird
doing there, perched on a

to Mr. Anderson's Pigeon

the Gentlemen in forensic cos-
tume hearing its caws? Some
well-informed person has told
us that it is the Eagle. From

are reported, in sinking a

who had bequeathed them to
the Seminary which he re-
garded with a national in-

himself in time to save his

No. IX.—Railways.
Part IV., and Last.—Concerning the Qualifications and Require-
ments of Railway Travellers.
Q. What do you oonsider to be the essential qualifications of a
successful Railway Traveller under existing railway regulations?
A. It is difficult to summarise them. Chief among them, how-
ever, may be mentioned:—
1. Unusual physical strength and endurance.
2. Absolute indifference to comfort and convenience.
3. Stolid and indomitable patience.
Q. Bat are not these the powers and qualities of a Spartan Athlete
rather than of an ordinary British Citizen?
A. Precisely. But the British Citizen who does not possess them
must necessarily suffer most severely in travelling by rail.
Q. Will you give me some explanation or illustration of this
startling position of yours?
A. It cannot be startling to the person who has travelled and
thought. Bat we generally travel, as we do most customary
things, without thinking. In this public habitude of unoonaidering
acceptance of the uncomfortable as the inevitable, lie the safety and
the opportunity of the corporate ghouls who prey upon us.
Q. But to details.
A. A railway traveller should have unusual physical gifts.
Strength and agility are imperatively demanded for the tasks of
mounting interminable flights of stairs, and climbing into almost
inaccessible carriages, especially when the traveller has been
detained by a sullen ticket-clerk, or is vociferously urged on by a
furious platform-porter. Lungs of unusual strength are requisite
in order to shout from one end of the platform to another for access
to, or liberation from, needlessly looked carriages. Hearing should

Commends the nuisance of our lengthy speeches

But vaulting ambition only, which o'erleaps

combine the opposite qualities of abnormal quickness and indifferent
dulness, the one to enable the traveller to catch the muffled mutter-
ings of officials, the other to enable him to endure the deafening din
of jangling bells, shrieking whistles, clanging carriages, rumbling
trucks, and shrieking porters. Most especially his eyesight should
be of the longest, sharpest, and quiokest imaginable description.
Q. Why so?
A. To give him the slightest chance of distinguishing such essen-
tial notifications as the destinations of trains and the names of Sta-
tions. The position of a somewhat short-sighted traveller when
the train stops at an unknown Station on a darkish night, is
extremely pitiable. He projects his head from the window. The
platform is very long, and indifferently lighted. The name of the
Station is posted np in small letters in a dark nook some fifty yards
distant, and is absolutely indistinguishable. He shouts wild inquiry
forth into the darkness. If any reply come at all—which is by no
means certain—it probably comes in the form of an inarticulate and
unintelligible howl, leaving the traveller the choice of plunging
out, and probably being left at a wrong Station, or remaining
where he is, and quite as probably being carried on miles past the
right one.
Q. But might not this be readily avoided f
A. Most certainly. The name of a station should be easily visible
from every carriage to any passenger not absolutely blind. This is
so obvious as hardly to require assertion, much less proof. It might
be managed with the most consummate ease. The neglect of it
argues either imbecility, or insolent indifference to the Public's most
ordinary convenience.
Q. Are there any other ways in which Railway Companies need-
lessly tax the physical resources of travellers?
A. Very many. The ordinary Railway Station is not to be sur-
passed by any known device of sinister ingenuity, whether in dreary
weary discomfort, or in facilities for catching cold. Its platform is
oppressively gloomy in the finest weather; in bad weather it is
exposed to every meteorological unpleasantness that blows, or drives,
or falls, or whistles, or soaks, or parohes, or numbs, or blinds, or
freezes, or palsies.
Q. But does it not furnish any sort of shelter against the subtly
varied assaults of our genial climate P
A. Very commonly none whatever. Sometimes, however, there
are things called Waiting Rooms P
Q. What are these P
A. Dens of dismalness and discomfort, as depressing to the spirit
as trying to the body. In these Waiting Rooms the would-be
traveller may—wait. He can do nothing else, save suffer. The
typical Waiting Room is, in fact, a public penitentiary. Its dis-
ciplinary powers, if fairly tested, would probably be found to com-
pare favourablv with those of Milbank or the Tombs.
Q. Is no other sort of retreat furnished for the waiting and
weather-tormented traveller P
A. Tes; there are places oalled—in a spirit of sardonic mockery—
Refreshment Rooms. At the most important Stations these, in some
sort, answer to their name; bnt at lesser Stations, where often what
they promise to our ear is mora urgently needed, the success with
which they " break it to our hope" is pyramidally complete.
Q. How is this effected P
A. By providing, at exorbitant prices, an extremely limited but
carefully selected supply of food warranted not to feed, and
"refreshments " guaranteed never to refresh. The consumption of
these articles—as an alternative to starvation—under conditions of
the greatest attainable discomfort, severely taxes the strongest
digestion and the most perfect temper. To travellers dyspeptic or
choleric it is productive of the most serious and lasting mischief.
Q. Does this singular tendency to wantonly tax the energies of
the traveller pervade all departments of Railway Management P
A. It does. The regulations and adjustments of Railwaydom are
calculated not for persons of ordinary physique, still less for the
feeble or valetudinarian, but for hardy, perfectly-trained Athletes of
keen senses, superb digestive powers, and indomitable patienoe.
They can only be praised in the Bame spirit as that in which Charles
Einosley lauded the British North-Easter. Combining all the
tedium of solitary confinement with all the trials of campaigning,
they might make invulnerable veterans of the few who survived
their hideous ordeal.
Q. Finally, why should the Publio put up with arrangements so
arbitrarily exacting and arduous?
A. To this question no satisfactory answer is possible or even
conceivable.

THE KHEDIVE'S POCKET-BOOK.
(A Leaf anticipatory of the Immediate Future.)
Mondat.—Sir Auckland Colvin oalled upon me, and explained
what he called " Lord Dufferin's Constitution." Sounded excellent.
I was to command the Army. Then I was to be assisted by a Counoil
yySJ'of Ministers having a sole right to initiate
legislation. Further, there was to be a Second
Council of Fourteen, partly nominated by my-
self and partly nominated by someone else.
Besides these, there was to be an Elective
Assembly of Forty-four Members, to be con-
vened occasionally for purposes of discussion
only. And, finally, I was to have the services
of Sir Auckland as a Finanoial Councillor.
Asked for further information—" What did he
mean by a Finanoial Councillor?" Sir Auck-
land replied, "Lots of things—he would make
yr' <i$>*. himself generally useful." Saw my way to a
small loan—" Could he (Sir Auckland) help
me in that T" "No, he couldn't; he was my servant—absolutely—
and it would not be dignified for the man to lend money to the
master." Saw my way to a pleasant arrangement. "As Sir Auck-
land was my servant," I said, " I would dismiss him on the spot."
Sir Auckland was very angry, and told me "not to play the fool."
He explained that as he was my servant absolutely, I could do
nothing without his advioe. very much frightened; and to
conciliate him made him Knight Grand Cross of an Order I have
recently created for Europeans—the White Elephant. He refused
the gift, and retired in a passion.
Tuesday.—Had a capital thought in the night, but did not like to
do anything without Sir Auckland's advioe. My Financial Coun-
cillor is so very irritable. When he came I asked him. "if I
understood him to say that I was head of the Army?" He
replied, "Certainly—all the troops were at my command." Ob-
served "that I thought so, and I would not trouble him any
further, as I had some business to attend to." Sir Auckland
wanted to know " What business?" "Oh," I replied airily, "I am
only going to send off the Anny to loot Constantinople." Sir Auck-
land again very angry, and told me "not to talk nonsense."
Explained to him (as my Finanoial Councillor) that Constantinople
was well worth the trouble, and would pay capitally. Sir Auckland
replied, that if he heard anything more about it he would have me
arrested, by a company of the English Line, and confined in a British
guard-room. Asked him " What was the good of being head of the
Army unless I could have a shot at somebody?" Sir Auckland
replied, "that it was impossible to explain anything to an Oriental,
but that a European would understand the situation perfectly."
Rather puzzled. Asked him then, '' What should I do with the Army,
as it was a pity to waste them." Sis Auckland admitted that it wat a
pity, and suggested (as my Financial Councillor) that I might let
the soldiers out as " supers " at so much the night to a local hippo-
drome or theatre. Fell in with the idea, which pleased Sir Auck-
land immensely.
Wednesday.—Evidently must leave the Army alone, so turned my
attention to domestic matters. In the course of the morning Sir
Auckland looked in, and asked " How I was going on?" Replied,
"Capitally—that my Counoil of Ministers had just deoreed that the
Fellahs were to pay me sixpence a head an hour for the privilege of
esoaping the bowstring." Sir Auckland in a furious rage. He wanted
to know " What they meant by doing thatf" Replied, that" by the
Constitution they surely had the right of initiating legislation?"
Sir Auckland answered, "Not that sort of legislation. 'Twas like
their something impudence to think of such a thing!" Sir Auck-
land advised me to dismiss them. Asked what 1 Bhould do "if
they refused to be dismissed?" "Why," he replied, "appeal to
your Seoond Council of Fourteen, whose special duty it is to curb the
action of the First Council." Sir Auckland looked so savage that I
agreed to do anything to please him. He replied. "I had better, or
he would write to Lord Granville about me." Begged him to for-
bear, and asked him "if he thought Lord Granville would like to
be a Grand Cordon of the White Elephant 'i" He said " that I had
better try, if I particularly wanted to be deposed by telegraph."
Thursday.—Sir Auckland came to see me at my urgent summons.
Told him that the First Counoil had punched the heads of the
Seoond Council, and that there had been a free fight all night in
consequence. He didn't seem displeased; on the contrary, expressed
his opinion that "the Constitution was working capitally,"
Asked him "Whether I Bhould summon the Elective Assembly of
Forty-Four Members?" He replied, "Certainly, but that I must
remember that they were to be convened for purposes of discussion
only." Asked him "What I should do if Counoil Number One killed
the members of Council Number Two, or vice versa t" He said that,
"speaking purely as my Financial Councillor, he should reoommend
s to refuse to pay for their funerals." Then, saying that "he could
not waste all his time in chatting with me," he went back to his
office in high good humour.
Friday.—I nave had such a time of it! I oonvened the Forty-
Four, and thought they would never leave me. They followed me all
over the place, asking for " backsheesh." Got rid of them at last by
telling them "that Sir Auckland was my Financial Councillor, and
would give them what they wanted." Ten minutes later the dreaded
Englishman rushed into my palaoe in a furious rage, and " wanted
to know what 1 meant by sending a pack of ragamuffins to him t"
Explained that they were not ragamuffins, but Notables." He
said he hated practical jokes, and it was luoky for me that there was
a dearth of orossing-sweepers in Cairo. It seems that Sir Auckland
has got rid of the entire Egyptian Parliament by supplying them
with brooms. Asked him if he thought they should collect the
alms of the Faithful for their own benefit?" He replied, "Of
course not," and that, acting as my Finanoial Councillor, "he had
ordered them to pay in their earnings to my privy purse." Very
pleased at this, and told Sir Auckland that I thought " the Consti-
tution not half bad." He said " I would like it very much when I
really understood it." Parted excellent friends.
Saturday.—Sent for Sir Auckland, to tell him that the two
Councils had killed one another, and that the Forty-Four Notables
had refused to leave their crossings, saying that they preferred their
present employment to any other. Added that the Army, having
been engaged by a perambulating_ cirous manager to go a tour round
the world, had consequently quitted Egypt. Sir Auckland con-
gratulated me upon having got rid of all my troubles ;" and
finally observed that he had told me that the Constitution would
act beautifully when it had once got into really proper trim!"

MOLLY-CODDLING LEGISLATION.
Though the Session has been consumed up to Easter with very
little practical work, and more than the usual amount of Irish
nagging, time has been found, in spite of Curtain-Lecture nights,
and the irrepressible jawing powers of the great O'Caudle Party, to
commence a piece of fussy legislation which is a disgrace to the
country. No one will deny that one-third of our national income is
drawn from national drunkenness; that we see no way to meet our
ever-increasing, and probably immoral, expenditure by raising
taxes in a less objectionable manner; no one will deny that public-
houses of all kinds are necessary creators of Revenue for a prodigal
Exoheqner, and yet public-houses are to be subjected to another
outburst of hypocritical State virtue.
It has long been illegal to play a piano in a tap-room—to mix the
pure gin of commerce with the harmless adulteration of Art; it has
long been illegal to temper drunkenness with certain games of
chanoe. The infamy of shove-halfpenny has long been as patent to
the legislative eye as the beauty of unmitigated swilling. Another
divine inspiration has descended upon the law-mongers. They have
discovered that the habit of paying wages in public-houses is wrong,
injurious, and ought to be made illegal, and they proceed to make it
illegal to the best of their ability. If they had the courage to close
all pothouses, and to arrange their expenditure so as to live without
the aid of drink and drinkers, it would be possible to admire their
consistency, even with the knowledge that a great inconvenience
was being inflicted upon the public. But these pettifogging attacks
upon a class of tradesmen who appear absolutely necessary to the
State, can bring neither honour nor profit to any Government.
Judging by the profusion of Mr. Leadek's—the new Lessee of
Her Majesty's Theatre—Advertisements, he is certainly not Lieder

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"The Parrot'a a dooaid good
aort of bird, don't you know."—
Mr. Kendal, in Act IV.
A GOOD "IMPULSE."
Impulse is a stupid name; but the play written on Impulte is
good, and the aoting leaves little to be desired. Mr. C. Stephenson
took an unsuccessful French piece, and thereupon founded a fairly
strong English play. The five Acts are so constructed that, though
the audience is perfectly certain how the piece must end, the means
whereby the happy denaument is to be brought about being adroitly
kept secret, ounosity is never once allowed to flag.
The dialogue is not brilliant, but to the purpose. There is no
waste of words; and, with one
glaring exception, in the First Act,
every speech is perfectly consistent
with the character who utters it.
The exception mentioned is, when
the haw - haw Swell, Captain
Crichton, describes the acoident
whioh has happened to Sir Henry
Auckland. Captain Crichton, well
played by Mr. Kendal, though
showing here and there a tendency
to over accentuate the comic
"points," is a typical English
"Heavy." He is straightfor-
ward, honest, sharp on occasion,
that is when his slow wits are
stimulated by the woman to whom
he is chivalrously devoted, but
unimaginative, and incapable of
uttering the sentimental description which characterises the speeoh
in question.
Beyond this, and the fact that the old Father, Sir Henry Auck-
land, is a bore,—as old fathers on the Stage almost always are, unless
they are ridiculous,—and that the character is played in too mincing
and namby-pamby a style by its representative Mr. Beaumont, who
ought to have his baok hair out as quickly as possible, there is abso-
lutely no fault to be found with the piece—if we allow the initial
improbability of the father, sister, and friend having kept from
Mrs. Macdonald the truth about her husband, who is on duty with
his regiment in India, having been wounded in the arm; a wound
that prevents his writing a letter to her, yet which is so slight that
he is able to return suddenly, ready to take his wife to both arms,
including the damaged one, which is not even in a sling. Grant
this, and the piece is comparatively faultless till the finish, when
the sudden collapse of the determined villain, the would-be seducer,
Victor de Kiel, at the request—for the appeal to him is scarcely
more than this—of Mrs. Beretford, who has never had the slightest
influence over him till this minute (when of course it's getting late,
and the sharper the finish comes the better), is weak and unsatis-
factory.
How it might have been ended, how Victor de Riel might have
been disposed of without resort to melodramatic action, must
have been a puzzle to
Author and manage-
ment. Don't tell
us that that scoun-
drel, Victor de Riel—
oleverly played by
Mr. Arthur, Daces,
who takes rather a
one-sided view of the
character,—his angle
of inclination being
invariably however to
the right,—don't tell
us, we say, that this
j man, growing rapidly
"grey in villany, and
more and more crab-
like—we mean putting
more and more side
on—as his passion is
intensified, on being
discovered with the

pursued with an un-
quenchable passion for

years, could be sud-

denly abashed, cowed,
and converted from the error of. his way, by a goody-goody
appeal to his better nature from somebody about whom he
doesn't care a brass farthing. Absurd. Up with the Curtain, and
give us Act VI., when he should return more lop-sided than ever,
and be ultimately collared by two keepers and conducted to the
nearest lunatic asylum. Or he might have been a French "Pre-

tender," or a Russian Nihilist,- to be captured at last by the Czar's
secret police, when he could take poison, or leap from the balcony of
the hotel, and his funeral be charged in the bill to the aocount of
that old idiot Sir Henry Auckland.
Mrs. Gaston Murray, as a kind of Miss Yellotoleaf, a Pauline
Pry losing her voice from cold, and trying to talk to a partially-
deaf man, is immensely funny—and not in the least overdone. This
situation between Mr. Beaumont, Mrs. Gaston Murray, and Mrs.
Kendal, as interpreter, is one of the best of the lighter scenes in the
piece, and is excellent natural Comedy.
Miss Linda Dietz, as the hopelessly weak, ill-dressed, and most
irritating idiotof a woman, Mrs. Macdonald, "invested the character
with artistic merit," and created for it an interest, and even a sympathy
whioh the charact or itself would fail to arouse, if it appeared only in
the pages of a three-volume novel. A sickly motiveless heroine,
who has absolutely done nothing, except indulge in a flirtation
which appears to have been only desperate on the man's side, and
who trembles at the prospect of meeting her husband as much as
if she had broken all the commandments en hloc, can only evoke
from any right-thinking man or sensible woman a very plain expres-
sion of opinion, whioh would probably take this form, "My dear,
don't be suoh a stupid fool." It is difficult to make anything of
suoh a character, but Miss Dietz makes the most of it, ana so far it
is an artistic triumph for her.
Mrs. Kendal is as good as she can be as Mrs. Seresford, but
there is not much opportunity for emotional display. Her acting is
never strained, ana
she makes the charac-
ter serve its purpose
as a part of a whole,—
never once forcing
herself upon the au-
dience. There is one
call upon her energy
in the last Act, when
she appeals to De
Riel, and it is not her
fault that this little
bit of Sunday School-
teacher's lecturing is
unnatural and out of
place; but, being so,
her rendering makes
it. as natural and as
consistent as it pos-
sibly can be.
The part of the
piece is, of course, Mr.
Kendal's 'Admirable
Crichton,' which might have grown into a Dundreary, had the
interest of the story been sacrificed to the idiosyncrasies of this
character. His playing in the Second Act, where he is as delighted
as a boy with his own sharpness, and is bo utterly nonplussed when
he has come literally to his wits' end—whioh is not far to go—is a
performance which Sothrrn himself, or Kobson in A Regular Fix,
could not have beaten; and, if he keeps it at that, and does not
repeat the catch-word of "You are—you know you are " too often,
it will never degenerate into the broad farce of a low comedian's
Tony Lumpkin, but will remain a sort of Vanity Fair caricature of
a type of our time, and a performance on which hereafter the artist
himself will be able to look back with pleasurable pride as a land-
mark in his histrionic career.
Mr. T. N. Wenman's Colonel Macdonald is very good, though, for
a hard self-controlled man, he is somewhat too demonstrative, not
in the scene in De RieVt room, where nothing could be better than
his sudden passion, but we mean in the scene with that poor old
dummy, Sir Henry, who might as well be a broken-down Guy
Fawkes in a chimney-corner after a fatiguing round of the streets on
the fifth of November. Why should Colonel Macdonald strike his
forehead, and appeal to Heaven P Wasted foroe.
We hope that when a new piece is required, the Management will
get a fresh Impulte, and go on better than ever.
On Thursday last, The Silver King reached its one-hundredth
night, and Mr. Wilson Barrett, in an affecting speech, told us how
pleased he was, how pleased everybody all over the world was, and
how grateful we ought all to be to himself and the Authors. Messrs.
Jones and Herman, as a trio of moral teachers and public bene-
factors. He gave an estimate, at a rough and ready calculation, of
how many people would be undergoing moral improvement on any
one given night when this piece was being played in Europe, Asia,
Africa, and America, and gave us all to understand that his aim and
object was to elevate Melodrama into the region of romance and
poetry, which the Silver King so far achieves by giving us some
splendid burglars, a first-rate Cockney clerk, and ("here comes in the
poetry) some rather wearisome speeches for the principal performer,
Wilfrid Denver, to utter whenever there is nothing particular to do.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Hooray for Romance, Poetry, and a Reality of a hundred pounds
profit per night! We '11 go in for Romance on these terms. Mr. Bab-
bett, in the First Act, as the drunken man, is excellent. Mr. Geobge
Babbett is inimitable as the doddering old Butler, Jaikes, and the
audience heartily recognise the fact that there isn't a better villain
in all London than Mr. Willabd, whose performance of the Spider

is admirable. By the way, wasn't it in Jonathan Bradford that the
intending murderer finds himself in the same room with the corpse
of the man whom he came to kill,—the same idea having occurred
to some one else previously and been acted upon?
We are curious to see how Mr. Rose has managed to dramatise
Mr. Austey's eccentric story, Vice Vend. If everybody feels the
same curiosity on the subject as we do, the Gaiety Theatre, on the
occasion of Mr. W. H. Griffith's matinie, when Vice Versa is to
be played, will be pretty closely packed. We don't see how it can
be done, because, when one person has to become another person
while that other person takes the other person's place, and yet is
still before yon unchanged, the situation is apt to become a little
mixed. We hope to be present at the successful solution of the
problem.

that even us Watermen can hardly stand it. But, if you've any
doubt about it, I '11 willingly row you about for an hour or two just
in the worst parts, and then you '11 be able to judge for yourself,
Our Own C. (hurriedly). No, thank you. Now I understand that
you are employed in some wav by the Corporation in their patriotic
inquiry. What have yon to do P
T. T. Well, you see, Sir, the Corporation—bless their liberal
souls!—wanted to find out how far the sewage that the Board
of Works pours into the river at Crossness and Barking, flowed up
the river with the tide. So they had a lot of floats made, that was
put into the river where the sewage was pumped into it, and it was
my duty to be ready in my boat, and row quietly along by the side
of one of the floats just to see how far the tide would carry it.
Our Own C. Not a very laborious duty, Mr. Tco.
T. T. No, Sir, not particular so; but sometimes it did get that
monotonous that I would willingly have exchanged for an nour or
two's hard spell agin a flood tide.
Our Own C. I can easily believe that, especially in clear water.
And what was the result of your interesting experiments?
T. T. Why, that on many and many a time the floats went up to
Chelsea, and, on one occasion, with a good swinging tide, one of them
went up as high as Chiswick.
Our Own C. Up to Chiswick! You really astonish me. But
what does that prove t
1\ T. Why, that all the mess that is so carefully taken down to
Crossness and poured into the river, and thought to be got rid of, is
ht back again, and carried backwards and forwards with
our noble river like a great cesspool.
Our Own C. I hope the Corporation pay you handsomely for your
disagreeable work P
T. T. Why, yes. Sir; I ain't got no cause to complain. But if
your Honour would just stand a

scarcely believe it possible, but it's a weel established fact that the
filthy sewage is gradually silting up the river.
Our Own C. Surely, Captain, you can't be serious?

my splendid steamer with safety, except upon the varra top ot the

Purposeless as poor Patch with his pea-bladder.

THE MAKING OF A MAGAZINE.
Dear Mr. Punch,—As Editor of the Review with which I have the
honour to be connected, I wish to reveal to the world'' the method by
which one of its monthly numbers is manufactured." I have no hesita-
tion whatever in placing before the whole cultivated world the secret
of the management of a " High-Class Philosophical Magazine."
Various principles lie at the bottom of my editorial system. In
the first place, you will perceive that my Review is nothing if it is
not "High-Class." How, I ask you, can I better preserve this
characteristic than by getting high-class personages—or, in other
words, members of the aristocracy—to write in it r In fact, to put
it plainly, a Magazine of any pretensions to philosophical excellence
must, if possible, contain at least one article written by a Lord. If
a Duke is willing, and I may add able, to write a passable paper, so
much the better. Of course a nobleman of real literary or political
eminence should be selected; but, failing suoh, anybody with a
"handle to his name" (to use a vulgar expression) will do. This is
the element of Rank, which is indispensable.
Then the next principle in the manufacture is to obtain somebody
to write about something on which he, or she, knows more than any-
body else living. This is the element of Special Knowledge. It
does not matter two straws what the subject may be. For instance,
if a person has given the whole of his mind to the cultivation of a
particular sort of turnip, or has embarked his entire intellectual
capital in the effort to prove the identity of the writer of some
(probably spurious) poetry with some other person who probably
never existed at all, or if he has been buried in the Dead-Letter
Office all his days, and can write a few pages of arrant "Shop"
about defunct epistles—suoh an individual should, at all costs, be
secured. He is sure to say something which is new, however unin-
teresting and unimportant, and cannot possibly be contradicted,
because in his own line he is the highest living authority. So much
for the element of Special Knowledge.
The last, and least important, element needed, is Literary Ability
and Philosophical Profundity. It is well, now and then, to have an
article which, besides being written by somebody whose name is
known, does really contain in it something which the competent
oritio can conscientiously commend. But, should the writer be un-
known, the extremest caution should be used in admitting his con-
tribution, whatever may be its excellence. You must try and make
each particular paper, by reason of the eminence of the writer, an
advertisement of the whole Magazine. So, if by any chance yon do
insert the outpourings of an unrecognised genius, make his article
anonymous! This adds the element of mystery. It may only be
poor old Professor Frrz-BooDLB, of Stoke-Pogis University; but, if
no name is mentioned, rumour will ascribe the article, supposing it
to be judiciously sandwiched between an obscure nobleman and an
eminent specialist, to the Marquis of Salisbury, or Mr. Gladstone,
or Professor Huxlky. Thus the end is obtained, and with the
additional advantage of saving money.
Just toshow you the way in which these principles are worked, I send
you a list of the articles in the forthcoming number of our Review,
for April, 1883, and hope you will now oonsider your questions as to

THE INDUSTRIOUS AND IDLE WARRIORS.
[A Story told, in Six Pictures, to the Marines.)
Picture I.—Entering the Army.—Here we have the two young
men making their first start in life. They have both received com-
missions. Robin Slowgo the Industrious has prepared himself by
a long and careful course of study for the profession he is about to
embrace. He has passed any number of examinations, and his
extreme pallor has been caused by excessive study. Edward
Scattercash the Idle, assisted by his father's gold-bags, has crept
to the Line from the Militia with the help of a cram. The two
young men exchange congratulations. Robin cannot help envying
Edward's good fortune as he points out that he has been gazetted to
a crack Regiment of Rifles. Edward, on the other hand, expresses
hia sympathy at his friend's had fortune—Robin has been appointed
to the Marines.
Picture II.— Work and Play.—Here we see Robin the Indus-
trious devoting his best energies to a score of arduous duties. He
has spent the earliest part of his professional life in garrison, on
board ship, as a soldier, a sailor, and sometimes even as a civilian.
He has been always at work. Edward Scattercash the Idle has
had very little to do. He has enjoyed long furloughs and special
leaves, with the assistance of his gun, rod, and hunter. He has
scarcely ever been in uniform, and half the men in his company
hardly know him by sight. It is needless to say that Edward still
belongs to the craok Regiment of the Line, while Robin remains in
the Marines.
Picture III.—Advancement.—By dint of hard work and unpre-
cedented luck, Robin has received his Company. He has grown

quite prey in the Service, and he is as old as and more
experienced than some young: Generals. He has never
left his Regiment, keeping either at headquarters, or
being detailed for detachment duty. Edwabd the
Idle has had altogether a pleasant time of it. Having
exchanged into the Cavalry on promotion, he has been
seconded for service as an Adjutant of Yeomanry.
The chief duties of this appointment has consisted in
dining with the Colonel (the Swell of the County) half-
a-dozen times a year, and turning out for six days in
the Autumn to perform the usual training. As Robin
becomes a Captain, Edwabd receives a Majority and
a Brevet-Lieutenant Colonelcy. The latter has all the
prizes of the profession at his feet, while the former—
remains in the Marines.
Pictubje 17.—After the Battle.—A war has broken
out, and the two young: men have been sent to the
front. Robin is lost in the obscurity of his battalion.
He fights bravely, and shows great power of organisa-
tion, but completely escapes recognition. Edwabd the
Idle is attached as an extra Aide-de-Camp to the best
Advertising General of the day. Consequently, he is
"well taken care of." His name appears constantly in
despatches, and at the end of the war his breast is
covered with decorations. He receives promotion and
£500 for carrying home despatches, telling how the
Advertising General has beaten the worst army in the
world with the assistance of the best. As this startling
intelligence has already been conveyed to the Sovereign
by telegraph, the reward is not quite in proportion
with the service rendered. However, soruplesof conscience
do not trouble Edwabd very much as he marches down
Fall-Mall to a snug little berth that has been made for
him at the War-Office. As for Robin, he returns to his
drudgery with the Marines.
Pictt/be V.—Middle Life—The two Soldiers have now
served for many years. Robin the Industrious has
married a wife as poor as himself, and with his miserable
pay has found it difficult to keep the wolf from the door,
much less defray the expense of children's schooling.
He has at length risen to field rank, and is entitled to
spurs and a brass scabbard. Edwabd the Idle has come
in for all sorts of good things. He has always been
on the Staff, and, as Military Secretary to a Viceroy,
has wedded an heiress with a title. His new family
connections have been most advantageous to him in
furthering his interests in his profession. When he is
scarcely forty he has become a General and a K.C.B.
However, in spite of his grandeur he still experiences a
friendly feeling for Robin when he sees the name of
his old associate included in the list of the Marines.
Pictube VI., and Last.— The Reward of Idleness and
Industry.—Here we have the exterior of St. James's
Palace on a Levee day. A mass of brilliant uniforms
are seen in the background. Room is being made for
the carriage of Lord Scattebcash, who wears a Field-
Marshal's uniform covered with decorations. His Lord-
ship has sauntered through life taking all the plums of
the profession that have been offered to him, with lazy
indifference. He is seen talking to a white-headed old
officer wearing the faded uniform of a Lieutenant-
Colonel. "Yes, SlowQO, my man," he is saying, with
lofty condescension. "With my interest I ought to have
been able to help you. I ought to have been able to have
got you a berth over and over again. But you see I
couldn't, my dear fellow—you had to stick to your
Regiment and field rank. Your advancement was barred
by your position." "Yes, I know, my Lord," replies
the broken-down, poverty-stricken old officer, with a
sigh, "/ belonged to the Marine*!"

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, March 12. — Interesting debate on
proposal of Great Eastern Railway Company to extend line to High Beech.
Ureat array of vindicators of popular rights. "House been sold onoe about
blowholes on the Embankment, not to be taken in again," says Mr. Puleston.
General state of virtuous indignation hostile to all railway projeots. Curious
effect among the Aldermen. Alderman Lawrence for Bill, Alderman Fowleb
against. Alderman Sir Andbew Lusk plaintively urges claims of his Consti-
tuents. They are, it seems, all "married men with wives and families;"
"circumstances not altogether unprecedented when men are married," Mr.
Fibth says.
_ "They want to go to High Beech by rail," Sir Andbew says, with tears in
his eyes. Apparently this the cole object of their lives. Sympathetic portion
of House pictures to itself the father of the family sitting disconsolate, his
wife in chronic state of tearfulness, children wasting away. A whole family—
married man, wife, and children—pining for opportunity to go to High Beech
by Great Eastern Railway!
"My Constituents," Sir Andrew whined, "want to get there, and the
House seems inclined to say, 1 No; we won't let you get there.'"
Believe this affecting scene would have oarried the Bill. Unfortunately,
one of Sir Andbew's Constituents present. It was Mr. Waddt. who admitted
to being a married man, also to a wife and children, and he bluntly declared
that "he did not want to get there." House began to look with suspicion on
Sir Andbew. Was it possible he had been deceiving them? Had he been
working on their feelings, picturing a state of things that was not? If he could
have arranged counter-demonstration, might have been different. A few
married men from Finsbury (having wives and children) appearing at the Bar,
and protesting that they " wanted to get there," would have settled the matter.
As it was, House obliged to accept sole testimony offered. Mr. Waddt, a
married man, ready to depose on oath that he, his wife, and family, did not
"want to get there." Accordingly, Bill thrown out.
"I shall appeal against this," Sir Andbew sobbed. "We'll have the

and families, will know the reason why."
"I'd advise you not to appeal," said Joseph Gillis. "Costs more
money, and it's no use." Business done.— Voting Army Estimates.
Tuesday Night.—Great incursion of Boers in both Houses. No
reference to Lord Stanley of Alderley, or Lord Denman, Mr. Stan-
ley Lbighton, or Sir George Balfour. Sharp short work in the
Lords, and some pretty speaking. Lord C rand kook led attack. Full
of fire and fury. Lord Derby replied.
"Discusses affair as if were arbitrating on difference in School
Board or Young Men's Literary Society," says Lord Dijnraven.
Lord Cairns as frigid as Lord Derby, but little more polish. Lord
Kimberley dull and prolix.
"Thinks he.'s going to dispose of the Boer question on the homceo-
pathio principle, sayB Lord Rosebery. "Similia limilibus curantur.
But bore on Boer, if not ezaotly false heraldry, isunattraotive oratory."
Lord Stanhope dissatisfied. Lord Brabourne condemnatory.
More than ever regrets he accepted the Peerage when forced on him
by Gladstone. Lord Salisbury delightful, as he always is when
discussing his noble friend and connection.
"Could hardly keep his hands off the Derby china when on his
own shelf," says the Lord Chancellor, with that solemn face whioh
lends point to the worst jokes; "but now he's Worcester than ever."
Some little hits immensely enjoyed by the House, Lord Derby
sitting all the while looking straight before him with stonewall
countenance, as if some one else was being discussed.
"The Duke of Wellington," says Our Only General, "when
being lowered from the arch, did not keep his countenance better
amid surprising circumstances than does my Lord Derby."
Perhaps prettiest speech of excellent Debate was Lord Granville's
few words spoken with smiling face and courteous gestures. Resolved
the whole matter, and fully two hours' talk, in a sentence, when he
pointed out that retrospect of Transvaal affairs could not stop exactly
two years back. "I think," said he, "the country will consider the
position we were put in by the policy of the late Government, whioh
made this most unfortunate annexation of the Transvaal."
Moreover, the smiling Earl pointed out that whilst Lords Cran-
brooe, Cairns, and Salisbury looked, daggers, they did not recom-
mend their use by the Government.
"These, my Lords," continued Earl Granville, with little nod
and smile, as if dismissing a deputation, "are sufficient results to
obtain from this Debate."
So Lords thought, and went home in good time for dinner, leaving
House of Commons to take two days in saying same thing over again
in form much less neat. Business done.—Invasion of the Boers.
Wednesday.—Mr. Gladstone put his foot down in New but
Grandly Manly way. Says we've bad enough of Sessions given up
to Irish legislation. Time other and not immaterial parts of the
British Islands
should have a
turn. So no more
Land Bills for at
least six months.

gratified the Tories, who were_ in terror of new concessions to
tenants. On the same ground it pleased what I call the Whigs—
that is, any Liberal who doesn't agree with me."
"But what about the Parnellites and the Liberals below the
Gangway?"
"My dear, but too simple-minded, Toby, there is no one in the
House better pleased. Puts both under positive personal obligations.

Party in Ireland, whioh means votes in English boroughs, and at same
time does no harm. If our vote would turn scale, and compel Glad-
stone to bring in Irish Land Bill, that would be different—not to
me personally, but to some others in this part of the House. But
he 'b quite safe, and we pose with advantage to ourselves without
hurting anybody else. As for Parnell, Gladstone's speech is
worth twenty thousand pounds, three years' sustentation fund for his

young men. He of course expeoted refusal, led up to it by presenting
impossible Bill. But didn't dare to hope for refusal in this tone."

Everybody tells everybody else so with congratulation. The House

day the Fenians have blown it up. Thought we were in for a quiet

evening. At question time, Mr. Reginald Yorke had brought
down his own private bombshell, whioh he had intended to explode
to the smashing, pulverising, and utter destruction of Son Herbert.
But it turned out that the fuse was damp. Didn't go off, and left
Reginald with a beautiful speech, illustrated with long extracts,
undelivered. Much sympathy with him on neighbouring Benches,
where Hon. Gentlemen had speeches of their own ready to fire off
after his explosion. Sank their sorrow in his more poignant grief.
"Never mind," said Warton, handing consolatory snuff-box.
"Don't tear up your manuscript or lose sight of the two chapters in
Hume's History of England you meant to quote at length. You can
move in Committee of Supply to reduce the Premier's salary by a
thousand pounds, and then fire off at Herbert. / mean to bring
on my Patent Medicines Motion in that way."
House had settled down into deadliest dulness. Mr. Gourley had
undertaken to answer Big Ben's question, put any time during last
fifteen years. '' Where's your Reserves? Opened subject on Duke
of Edinburgh's Report. Hadn't got far when interrupted by
another report. Duke of Edinburgh in Gallery waiting to hear

off to Parliament Street. Several arrested by strange Policemen on sus-
picion. Sir William Harcourt after first shock calm and resolute.
"What I don't like," Bays he, "is their sending boxes to me.
Denning refuses to open them unless his salary is doubled. Clerks
in Home Office get out of the way, and busily engaged all day when

to one (A 1). "They will be trying this plaoe next."
"No, Sir," Bays A 1, lowering his voice confidentially, and point-
ing with thumb over his shoulder to House. "There's too many of
them there, and they 're regler sitters."
Don't know what he means. Dursn't ask. Might be arrested on
suspicion. Think 1 '11 go and take a walk on Hampstead Heath, or

Friday.—Debate on Transvaal continued. Forster came out
splendidly. Insists we shall go to war to reinstate Chumsizanie, or
some other black Gentleman in South Afrioa who's been having his
hen-roost robbed. Never mind talking about cost in life or coin.
Go to war first and talk of that afterwards. Know now why a
man's called a Quaker. "'Cause he makes you quake." Haven't
got over the explosion yesterday, and here's Forster on the war-
path! Business done.—None.
To Bobbies and Burglars.—" The Ministry," says the Daily
Telegraph, "will probably introduce a short measure "—don't like
"short measures," as a rule—"for the purpose of dealing at once
with the urgent question of the simplification of areas, and adjust-
ment of boundaries of local authorities." This seems to be good
news for the burglar, or the Policeman on his beat,—or for both.
"Simplification of areas " certainly affects them equally.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NEW LAMPS FOR OLD.
Even Practical John Hollinoshead's "sacred lamp of Bur-
lesque " occasionally requires refilling with oil, or most assuredly it
will sputter, flare, smoke, and eventually go out, leaving nothing
behind but a disagreeable vapour.
More nonsense has probably been
written about Burlesque than about
any amusement ostensibly patron-
ised by the people. It is too often
assumed that the difficult art—nay
more, the wholesome and necessary
art of courteous caricature—is one
of no literary pretension, and may
be safely flung as a sop to the silliest
and vainest member of the profes-
sion devoted to acting. The fallaoy
of this proposition has been proved,
notwithstanding Practioal John's
periodical spars with sensitive
Critics, by a degraded estimate of
the possibilities of Burlesque, and a
growing carelessness and indiffer-
ence on the part of its interpreters.
A Gaiety play has, by inattention
to the simplest rales of dramatic
political economy, come to be
considered embodied childishness;
the Gaiety performers have too
frequently mistaken petting for
popularity.
Blue Beard in form and in colour,
in aim and in opportunity appears
to be the kind of oil that the sacred lamp required. The flickering
flame greedily swallowed it, up it Btarted into brilliancy, and behold
the Critics and the Cynics are shaking hands, forced laughter is
exchanged for honest merriment, and the Gaiety company plumes
out its feathers, and the individual members of it have no longer
to study themselves, but the characters entrusted to them. So long
as they put earnest purpose into their work, they need never be
ashamed of their calling. Why should they be? As their pre-
decessors in the best English school of Burlesque, they have had
Robson—clarum et venerabih nomen—a. genius although a Burlesque
Actor—Marie Wilton and Miss Herbkht—Comedians although
Burlesque Actresses; engaged in the very same occupation have been
Ada Cavendish, John L. Toole, Henry Irving, W. H. Eendal
—one of the most favourite Burlesque Actors Glasgow ever had—
David James, Thomas Thohne, John Hare—he might have been
seen in petticoats at the Prince of Wales's Theatre—and indeed all
the best Comedy Actors and Actresses of our time. For Burlesque
properly considered is not a hasty pudding of jingle and music-hall
songs, or an opportunity for smart clothe3 and breakdowns, but a

funny play with point and oircumstanoe, containing a legitimate
opening for parody and caricature. What indeed are the Gilbert
and Sullivan's Operas but Burlesques dressed up in the fine and
fashionable feathers of Comic Opera? Are these Sorcerers and
Pinafores, these Pirates and Iolanthes, with their Policemen and
Soldiers, their Curates and Lord Chancellors, their love-sick Maidens
and love-struck Guardsmen, any less Burlesque because they are set
to music by an accomplished musician who is himself a humorist in
music, instead of being decorated with the best existing and popular
music that comes to hand. Mr. George Grossmith Bings patter-
songs, and so does Mr. Edward Terry, the latter having the better
of it as far as voice goes. The lyrics awarded to Miss Farren are
no less laughable than such as are entrusted to Mr. Barrington.
Miss Kate Vatjghan might be as usefully employed as a shepherdess
or fairy as Miss Leonora Braham or Miss Marion Hood, the
Savoyards having the advantage in vocalisation, and the Gaiety in
the "poetry of motion."
Miss E. Farren, deservedly one of the most popular Actresses on
the Stage, who, in other days, might have been—with discipline—a
Mrs. Abington or Mrs. Jordan, needs no lime-light now to empha-
sise the fact that she is an Artist. Her singing of "My Boy," in
variation, suggestion, and Cockney whimsicality, is a masterpiece.
With no pathetic touch to assist her, as in Mr. Reece's capital
street-Arab's song, the humour of the thing is just as bright and
keen. Her performance of Blue Beard is not a confidential com-
mentary between Miss Farren and her audience, but a clever bit of
skilful burlesque acting.
Nor need Miss Vaughan lean upon her milliner for distinction in
an Art in which she is evidently proficient. Hitherto her fanciful
attire and her grace-
ful steps have con- /' v
stituted her claims
as an Actress; but
now her singing of
a broken - French
song, and her swift
and short imitation
of Saba Bern-
hardt, develop a
charming fund of
happy caricature.
That excellent
comedian, Mr. E.
Terry, has hitherto
been forced to
squirm and twist
and exaggerate his
own style for lack
of literary or comic
suggestion; but
now, as the broken-
down, impecunious father of Mrs. Blue Beard, he is as genuinely
funny as Jemmy Rogers ever was in the palmy days of the Strand.
Miss Connie Gilchrist is " getting a big girl now," but has lost
none of the artlessness of her childhood; necessarily a subordinate
figure, she is always a pleasant companion to her associates on the
stage. But the spirit of Blue Beard is otherwise infectious. How
often, under other and more depressing circumstances, the assistants
and extras have gone through their work wearily and miserably.
Now they Btart into life and action; they are aroused to intelligence,
and try, at any rate, to do their best. Even Mr. Irving could not
be offended, or Mr. Kyrle Bellew outraged at the caricature by
Mr. Henley, who cleverly, and in a few touches shows how uncon-
sciously Mr. Bellew imitates Mr. Irving; and there is not a
"Masher " in the famous front row who would break his crutch with
raee, or disturb the symmetry of his shirt-front on account of the
reflected affectation and mirrored apathy of the pretty young Ladies
who so serenely satirise the youthful follies of an effeminate and
unrobust age. If Blue. Beard sets the example, never neglected in
the days of Robson, Wilton, Rogers & Co., of making the company
act up to the play, the reaction will not have been in vain. It is a
Btep in the right direction, and though much more remains to be
done, yet as matters stand all are satisfied, Company, Comedians
and Critics.
Additional Verse to an Old Song.
"They will spoil the Embankment," says Hogg unto Smith,
"But of course it's no business of mine!"
Says Smith, "'Twould look better without them than with,
But of course it's no business of mine!"
Says Perot to both, a young Percy quite per se,
"Won't enter the lists against Westminster's Circe.

But of course it's no business of mine 1"

TO "HUBERT" FKOM TOBY.
Dear Hubert,
Let me congratulate you on your pluck, which
is ever the characteristic of your noble race. You have
indeed proved yourself worthy of your illustrious desoent.
And surely the two gTeat Saints, whose names you bear,
must have had you under their special protection,—I
mean 8S. Hubert and Bernard, for whom, (the latter
especially, as I confess to being a trifle ignorant about
the former, though I am a Protestant dog myself), I
have always had the most profound admiration,—as
your esoape from the knives of the cowardly assassins,
or at least from the knife of the one scoundrel whom I
hear you collared and dragged to the ground was simply
miraculous. Bravo, Hubert!
Do write and give me particulars, there's a good old
boy! Confirm the story by.your own " Ipse Dixie." Do
tell me exactly how you escaped. Go into details, with-
out any waggery, you old rascal you! and let me know
how you seized that man in woman's olothes. Did you
tear a great piece out of his dress? Or out of his leg P
Didn't ne use his knife at all? Why did you let him go
when you'd once got him down? And when poor Lady
Florence was stunned, and with a handful of dirt in her
mouth, didn't the other assassin, who thought that, after
three stabbings, he had settled her, make for you?
And hadn't you to struggle with them both? Did they
cram dirt down your throat, old man, to prevent you
from barking? Was one about to stiek you, and did the
other, with some touch of humanity left in him, intercept
his murderous design?
Did you, in your frantic rage, tear the female dresses
worn by these two disguised men all to shreds,—for, up
to the present moment of my writing this, I have not
heard that any trace of those gowns has been discovered?
Now do comply with my request, which is the request
of all England, for full information from you, and do
not simply wag your tail and say, "Bow. wow, wow!"
I tell you, Hubert, I will not be put off with "Bow,
wow, wow!"
I am informed that after these deeds of daring you did
not "reappear till the following morning." This is the real
modesty of a genuine hero. In this "dog trait" 1 recog-
nise my own noble St. Bernard. But, old fellow, don't
think me impertinent if I ask, where were you?
The noble deeds of your great ancestors were for a
time partially discredited by impertinent visitors to
Mount St. Bernard's, who said that the Grand Old Dogs
never did carry half-frozen children to the Monastery.
Many, in this sceptical age, don't believe half they hear
about the doings of the Great St. Bernard Dogs, and it is
for you, my Hubert, to take this opportunity of coming
forward, and telling the Bcoffers how you saved a Lady's
life, at the risk of your own, and miraculously esoaped
from the ruffians armed with knives, without a scratch
on your muzzle, or even a rumpled coat.
Speak out in your own defence, my boy, as, already,
there are some—but 1 have set them down, and warmly
defended your reputation—who insinuate that your name
should be changed from Hubert to Falstaff— but they will
never make me believe that you are a '' false staff " to
trust to in a difficulty, or that the scoundrel you pinned
to the ground was one of the notorious gang of " men in
buckram." May you live long and prosper. Write
soon. Yours ever,
Tobt.
P. S.—There was another Florence who had a faithful
dog whose name was "Diogenes." Do you remember
how he made for Mr. Toots, and how that Gentleman
said "it was of no consequence," eh? I don't think that
ruffian whom you took by the calf would have been of
Mr. Toots's opinion. Speak up!

The victory of the Bluebuff Candidate in Central Clodshire yesterday, by a
largely inoreased majority of Seven—at the General Election in 1880 it was only
Six—is one of those events whose importanoe can hardly be overestimated and
hose significance can never be exhausted. We pointed out some days since,
that whilst no sort of meaning and no kind of credit would attach to the victory
of the Buffblue Candidate, the defeat of that ill-advised intruder upon a con-
stituency whose loyalty to Bluebuff principles has so long been conspicuous,
would cover our party with glory and inspire it with hope. The event has
proved that we, and we alone, were entirely right. The machinations of
our opponents have failed ignominiously, their Candidate has Buffered a crushing
defeat. Nor, ingenious as they ever are at inventing hollow excuses and fudging
up factitious consolation, will they in this case find a Bingle circumstance to
lessen their profound disappointment or mitigate their deep disgrace. The battle
was fought upon broad Party Principles, the Buffblues had every advantage in
their favour; buttered up to the ears by their Candidate, and caucussed up to
the chins by the local wire-pullers, they polled their very last man, and—were
beaten by Seven!!!
Ah, that Seven I "We are Seven," sang the poet's simple interlocutor. The
Clodshire Seven, more glorious than the "Seven against Thebes"—may make
those words the refrain of a patriotic pecan that shall ring down the ages and
sound on into the Bluebuff millennium.
It may perhaps be said that after all they were only Seven, and that they
only secured a seat which before had been saved by Six! But this would not be a
just estimate of the result. Would the Romans have rejoiced less in the saving
of the Capitol if they had found that the goose-flock which saved it numbered
not more than 8even r The true measure of the magnitude of our triumph may
be found—in the efforts we must have made to minimise it had the saving Seven
been on the other side.

BXTHACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 19.—Chables Lewis ie baok
after serving the constituency of Derry in the Far West. _
"Yes." says Mr. Catne, to whom I make the observation; "but
you needn't mention it. Lewis won't be in the House half-an-hour
before he '11 advertise the interesting faot through what are oalled
the usual channels of information."
Caine right as usual. Can't exaotly recall how often Lewis was
up in course of sitting, but know it was on every possible stage.
First on notices, next on questions, thirdly in debate. This is
making up for lost time. By
Whitsuntide he'll be straight
with Members who've been here
since February.
Sir R. Cross wants to know
how it was House was Counted
Out on Friday.
"Very proper quarter for
inquiry to oome from," says Mr.
Cham he it lain, "seeing he
wasn't there himself to help to
make a House."
Mr. Chtldebs volunteers to
reply. Interesting narrative of
how he met Lord Richard
Gbosvenob when going out to
dinner: how Lord Richard
asked him to "be down at nine
o'clock, and bring as many
Members with him as he could
get."
"This," says General Bubna-
bt, "oomes of old associations.
Orosvenor forgets Chllders no
longer Minister for War. Sends
him out on picket duty."
Pleased vision dawns before
House of Mr. Childers eating
hasty dinner, then running out
to patrol St. James's and Parliament Street, picking up stray Mem-
bers, arresting them, and marching them down to make House.
Mr. Yorks, momentarily withdrawing his mind from Eilmainham,
inquires about the mystery at Windsor—" That terrible struggle for
life in the lonely plantation near the Willows," as Standard beauti-
fully calls it. House laughs. Why should House laugh P Laughs
when Gladstone says, with great gravity, "I don't think

The Eaater Lily.
ome Secretary is in a position to give any information which
would be of value to the House."
Campbell-Bannerman, like practical Scotchman and enthusiast
in office, inclined to take business view of the matter.
"Seems to me," he says to Sir Edward Reed, "that here we
have the problem solved of the protection of the Navy. We have
been hammering away at it for years, and spent millions, and all
the time have had close at hand, within domestic circle, the true
armour-plating of the future."
"Oh," says Reed, hastily, "if you're going through your speech
again, I '11 see you by-and-by."
"No; I'm only sorry this didn't happen a day or two before I
made my speech. Would have been a great point. Thing is, get
corsets made on principle of Lady Florence Dixie's; plate ships
with them, and there you are. Nothing would go through them. At
once oheap and effectual. Suppose you don't know the address of
the corset-maker?"
"Of corse 'eta no business of mine now," said the former Chief
Constructor, looking a little vexed I thought at the idea having first
occurred to C.B. "But suppose the thing will be advertised. When
there's great fire, and papers are preserved in a safe, always see
advertisement afterwards. Expeot when Lady Florence's hand is
better, she '11 write to the corset-maker something after this style :—
"' Dear Madam,—I am happy to inform you thatyour knife-and-
dagger-resisting corsets have saved my life. Walking in my
grounds, on Saturday evening last, I was attacked by two men in
female attire. It was a fearful time, and I struggled nard. Thrice
a man smote me with a dagger. His eyes were dark, and so was his
hair. His features were livid, his white teeth firmly clenched, and
he wore a green dress. Thrice he struck, and thrice the faithful
corset foiled his blow. In short, but for your corset I should now be
a corse. You are at liberty to make what use you please of this
letter. I remain, yours faithfully and gratefully, &c, &c.'
"That's the sort of thing you may look for."
"Thank you," said C.B., fl never thought of that."
Business done,—Bankruptcy Bill read a Seoond Time.
Tuesday.—Things rather gone off to-day. Sir R. Cross was to
have brought on question of Cuban Refugees. But it seems Spanish
Government are coming round to right view of matter, and Spaniards
mustn't be hurried.
"Generally long time coming round to anything," Sir Abthuk
Otwat says, "especially to right view."
Randolph furious. Had meant to put things straight after little
weakness last Friday when he agreed
with Gladstone on Amendment to
Transvaal Debate. Only did it, he
explains apologetically, in order to
get rap at Hicks-Beach. Still, to
have asked Gobst to withdraw
Amendment in favour of one suggested
by Premier, makes him feel uncom-
fortable. Meant to have put it right
to-day on Cuban Refugee business,
and here's Cboss positively drawing
back. Randolph glares upon uncon-
scious Sir Richard as if it was hit
hat he sat upon on resuming his seat.
Whereas it was only Sclater-
Booth's.
Debate on Grand Old Committees
notpreoiselyentertaining. Mr. Razees
makes a melancholy speech. Gather
generally that with Grand Committees
the country will hurry with hastened
steps to destruction. House takes
matter very quietly, considering, and
finally agrees to refer Bankruptcy Bill.
More about Lady Florence Dixie. Mr. O'Shea wants publio
inquiry. Impenetrable gravity of Sir William Harcourt when he
answers that inquiry going on, but he's "not in position to make
any statement on the Bubjeot." More laughter when Mr. Labou-
chebe asks whether reward will be offered for discovery of guilty
SartiesP Sir William Harcotjbt graver than ever. Like me,
oesn't see the joke. No joke at all for people with dark hair and
eyes, pale face, and white teeth, especially if they look as if they
occasionally wore a green gown.
At seven o'clock House up for Easter Holidays.
Business done.—Go home till Thursday week.

Lord K. Churchill doesn't put

THREAT TO BLOW UP THE TOWEK.
A little boy, who gave his age as eleven, was discovered in
Thames Street this morning with a halfpenny squib and box of
matches. On the explosives being taken away from him, he
admitted, on cross-examination, that his intention was to blow up
the Tower. The investigation was still proceeding when our reporter
left.
OUTRAGE AT THE HOME OFFICE.
Between half-past eleven and a quarter to twelve this morning a
stranger, wearing a large woollen comforter and ordinary black kid
gloves, but who, the messenger on duty happened to note, was
eating an orange in rather an excited manner, deliberately entered
the Home Office, and asked the way to the Stamp Department.
Shortly afterwards, Sir William Habcoubt having occasion to leave
his official room, slipped down on a piece of the peel that had been
evidently left designedly on the stairs. The worthy Baronet, though
not much shaken, said he supposed that the outrage was political,
and might not be unconnected with the New Bankruptcy Bill. The
affair is in the hands of the police.
DI8C0VERT OF ARMS IN THE REGENT'S CANAL.
This afternoon a dredging-machine, while clearing a portion of
the Junction basin, brought up from the bed of mud at the bottom
a couple of old kitchen knives and a carving-fork. The weapons
had evidently been in the water for some time, and the circumstance
has naturally caused muoh excitement in the immediate neighbour-
hood.
ALLEGED DISAPPEARANCE OF AN ARCHBISHOP.
An Archbishop, who has been staying at Buxton for the waters,
disappeared mysteriously from his hotel yesterday evening, and, as
snow was falling at the time, it was feared that he had been buried
alive in one or more of the drifts on the hills, for which the locality
is famous. Great relief was therefore experienced when it was
discovered that the worthy Prelate had been merely spending a few
hours quietly at the house of a friend.
REPORTED EARTHQUAKE AT WINDSOR CASTLE.
A Correspondent from Egham writes to us:—" I was visiting
the State Apartments at Windsor in the usual manner yesterday,
when it struck me that I noted a decided oscillation of the stone
bannisters on the grand staircase. As I had not long lunched, I
could not possibly have been mistaken, and I called the attention of
the Cicerone to the fact. I have not the slightest doubt but that the
phenomenon was due to a severe shook of earthquake.",
MYSTERIOUS EXPLOSION IN THE CITY.
This morning, between half-past-six and seven, a rather loud
report was heard in the neighbourhood of Milk Street, and on the
Pol iceman on duty making inquiry, it was discovered that a slight
accident had occurred to a kitchen-boiler that had not been properly
repaired. Several arrests have already been made in connection with
the affair, and some startling revelations are expeoted.
FRIGHTFUL RAILWAY COLLISION.
Yesterday evening, a coal-truck on one of the Great Northern
sidings at King's Cross, having been shunted by mistake on to the up
line, ran against a stationary break-van, with sufficient foroe to
damage a pane of glass in the window of the latter, and almost throw
the Guard off his feet. The noise occasioned by the shook of the
meeting trucks is said to have been heard distinctly at nearly three
yards' distance. The line was speedily cleared. There will be a
searching investigation into the affair.
8USPECTED ANARCHISTS AT CAMBERWELL.
Soke strangers have lately been seen in the neighbourhood of
Camberwell; and yesterday they lunched at a well-known public-
house, without any apparent object. It is thought, therefore, that
they are very likely Anarchists, a threatening, coloured, and illus-
trated letter of a scurrilous charaoter having been received by the
Vicar on the morning of the 14th February last.
NARROW ESCAPE OF THE EMPEROR OF GERMANY.
The Emperor of Germany, was yesterday morning about to take
a turn in the Garden Platz, at the rear of the Palace, when an
extremely heavy and drenching shower of rain came suddenly down,
and determined His Majesty to abandon his stroll. The escape was
a most narrow one, and has excited lively comment and congratula-
tion in Court circles.
DIX'S LAND.
[" The Rev. Dr. Morgan Dix has been delivering some ferocious Lenten
lectures at Trinity Chapel, New York, concerning the shocking depravity of
the American girl .... It hag pleased Dr. Dix to denounce the higher
education of women as if it were certain to result in the ruin of the sex."—
Pali-Mall Gazette.]
Oh, Dr. Dn, oh, Reverend Dix!
So hot at denouncing the sex and its tricks,
Your mind must be full of queer rioks and cricks,
You are right off the rails, oh, my Reverend Dix;
'Tis wrong-headed " goodies like you who would fix
The yoke on the woman, and then it she kicks
You " slate " her as though she had stolen a Pyx,
Like Bardolph. The sex like ourselves—is a "mix,"
There are some who are bad, there are some who are "bricks,"
But keep them in darkness to cure them? 0, Dix I
The whitest wax-candles, without any wioks,
Would be little use in this world. The fierce flicks
Of your heavy flageUum fall wildly; some prioks
Of sharp ridicule's goad you deserve, for it licks
Common sense to perceive what you re at. Budding quicks
Need light, nor do women need darkness, my Dix.
If you 'd nurture their morals by teaching them nix.
Be sure that you'd not make them seraphs, but " sticks,"
In your dull Due's Land "—not Arcadia, Drx,
But a soulless Bceotia, sombre as Styx.
A Common Complaint.
Scene—A Common, of which, by defacing it with a Cutting, a Railway
Company have sacrificed the Scenery to their Commercial Interests.

"One Volunteer is worth six Pressed Men," as a flattened Gentle-
man remarked in an overcrowded first-class carriage, going down to
Brighton on Easter Monday.
"Restriction op Output."—The Affirmation Bill.
This represents pictorially Mr.
Dumb-Crambo's view of what
we've heard a good deal about
recently, i.e.—

Manifest-toes!
Ballad on a Bouquet.
Just as, by any other name,
As sweet would smell a Rose,
So would an Onion, all the same,
Offend a dainty nose.
Plain fact, in peri phrase conveyed,
From naming short we shrink;
'Twere coarse to call a spade a
And use the word we think.
Reformed Reviewing.
Reviews are all too long, and
too discursive. They should be
short, sharp, and to the purpose.
For example, "Sow to Chrow
Mushrooms, bv Willi am Earley.
There is mush room for a little
book of this description. It is
evident the early Bill picks up
the mushroom." This is the
kind of thing we want to see intro-
duced in our critical journals.

A Light of Law, none stronger or more keen,
Quenched in Death's sudden shadow, to be seen,
A steadfast beacon of clear Right no more;
Lost matchless judgment, lost unrivalled lore,
The sharp, swift insight, the unerring skill,
The strength unbending and unshaken will
That lifted to high fame and pride of place
The virile soion of a virile race.
And even as men mourn their cold eclipse,
Another Light, extinguished not, yet slips
From the full gaze of countryman and friend.
Though one great life yet brightens to the end,
Sad seem the lines that, on one morning, tell
Of Jkssel's death, and Phlllimobe's farewell.
"THE HAPPY FAMILY."
Thb Cabinet are not a happy family, in the literal sense of the
words, as regards the question of Municipal Reform.
However thoroughly united they may be in regard to other and
more important matters, although even this has been questioned, on
the difficult matter that Sir William Harcourt, in an evil hour for
his own peace of mind, undertook to arrange to the satisfaction of
all men, they are certainly not as one man.
First and foremost stands their great leader with his inborn love
and reverence for all institutions hallowed by age and historical
associations, who takes every possible opportunity of declaring
emphatically, that the reform of the old Corporation when it comes,
"if ever it come," shall only tend to increase its power, and its
prestige, and its influence for good, and enable it to continue more
freely its great and useful work. Sir William is said to find in
him anything but enthusiastic support.
The Lobs Chancellor, with his intimate knowledge of the good
deeds of the Livery Companies, gained by his position as Master of
the Mercers, the premier Quild of London, betrays no great longing
for any radical ehange in the Corporation or its associated Companies.
Lord Granville has that inborn dislike to all unnecessary change
that it is reasonable to expect in a prosperous and popular Peer who
has to conduct all the foreign affairs of this great Empire.
Lord Derby is, we learn, so utterly disgusted with the unusual
conduct, to use the very mildest phrase in our vocabulary, of the
President of the semi-defunct League, in regard to the proceedings of
the City Guilds Commission, that he never hears of his name or his
acts or of anything that is his, without indulging in unparliamentary
language.
Mr. Chtlders is so constantly absorbed in mental calculations of a
most abstruse character, as to now to meet the enormous deficiency
anticipated from the brilliant success of the Blue Ribbon Army, that
whenever the subject of Municipal Reform is persuasively intro-
duced to him by Sir William, bis sole reply is, "Oh, bother!"
Lord Haktinuton, as is well known, votes the whole thing a bore,
and tells everybody that, as Habcotjrt voluntarily got himself into
the mess, he must get out of it again the best way he can, and he
hopes it will be a lesson to him in future to take Mr. Punch's
advice and stay more at Home, and attend'to the necessary duties of
his offioe.
Mr. Dodson is of course nobody, and he's never yet got over the
look ef amazement with whioh he first found himself really and
truly a Cabinet Minister.
Lord Spencer, with his experience "of Dublin, naturally shudders
at the idea of largely increasing the power of any Municipality, and
has a very strong conviction in his secret soul that a very consider-
able majority of his fellow Peers will prove to be of the same opinion
when the question is submitted to them.
Mr. Chamberlain, it is well known, has expressed himself very
strongly against one Municipality for the whole Metropolis, and is
in favour of separate Municipalities for the several Parliamentary
Boroughs: and as he has had more munieipal experience than all
the rest of his colleagues put together, his opinion should have great
weight.
The only Minister, in fact, on whom Sir William can rely is Sir
Charles Dilkb; but as the very well understood and very freely
expressed opinions of Sir Charles, on nearly all political questions
of importance, are far and away in advance of those of aristocratic Sir
William, his new colleague's over-zeal troubles him almost as much
as the calm indifference, or worse, of his older friends. The one
point, however, on whioh they both cordially agree is in their deter-
mination to shake off all further connection with the moribund
League; and if its astonished President could but know who forms
the subject of some of the best mots of these equally celebrated wits,
it might teach him a lesson that would prove worth the learning.
The last rumour at "The Reform" is that the returns just sent
into the Home Offioe, as to the probable number and charaoter of the
constituency of the contemplated New Municipality, are of so
strikingly democratic a charaoter, that the introduction of the pro-
posed measure, put off until after Easter, may even be postponed
until after Whitsuntide, so as to afford more time for a thorough
study of the returns in question.
CRINOLETTE.
Time was when a hideous fashion
Moved mankind to ire and spleen,
Till the Ladies took compassion
On us, scorning Crinoline.
Now a horrible successor
Comes to make men fume and fret,
And a wild outrageous dresser
Dares to wear a Crinolette.
Crinoline was bad, but surely,
Cages dangling in the dirt,
Wobbling very insecurely.
Don't improve a lady's skirt;
But no matter how this praotioe,
Inartistic, first began,
It, we 're thankful, as a faot, is
Chiefly loved by Mart Anw!

JOHN MORLEY, ESQ., M.P.,
The Northern Light-Weight,
showing how he went in pell-mell, and fought knightly.
IN THE NORTH COUNTREE.
(NEWCASTLE VERSION.)
With thanks to Mr. Theo. Marzials.
There's many a famous Member in the North Coiinlree,
Many favourites of the Caucus, many speakers of renown;
But oh! among the smartest that ever you did see,
Is Radical John Morlet, who came down from London town.
We all sat around our Association Board,
When the Tories had a fancy that their man might win;
And then he came, so square and fair and broad,
Uncompromising rectitude about his solid chin.
And he sang to us there a Pall Mall song,
Till we all must needs sing too;
Of William, grand old Leader, and of Joseph smart and strong,
Witty Vernon, Chelsea Charlie frank and true.
And we said, "Our town will make, unless we muoh mistake,
A comfortable seat for you I
Ay, a comfortable seat for you I"
There is many a famous Member in the North Countree
A-taking oare the Liberal sun shall not go down.
But Morlet lit a candle that you all might see,
Our shrewd and sparkling Morlet from far London town.
Light it tript, that fluent tongue,
Sharp and pat to logic's dance.
Only Joe Cowen his grand head hung,
And sulked in a corner, and glared askance.
But Morlet came to win, and he had his way,
We " heckled " him, and searched him through,
SCIENTIFIC JOTTINGS.
Dr. Siemens is reported to have
grown strawberries by means of
electricity—very nice, he says,
although slightly savouring of
the ourrent. Latest fruits of
Soience.
And says we, "Our town will make, unless we much mistake,
A comfortable seat for you!
Ay, a comfortable seat for yon I"
There's many a Tory voter in the North Countree
A-breaking of his heart as the Bruce goes down.
And Joe stood a-sighing; but he says, says he,
"After all, it's very little use to fume or frown."
And the Tories own a " beat."
Liberal cheers then rent the skies.
At the sound of their defeat
Our John Morlet did uprise,
And his manly voice sounded so clear on our ear—
"Oh, Liberals straight and true,
Bruce is really a good fellow, for all that I can hear,
But for Newcastle he '11 hardly do.
'Tis I that will make, unless I much mistake,
The very sort of Member, friends, for you!
Ay, the very sort of Member, friends, for you!"
A Warning in Waxwork.
Sundrt posters in divers places announce that a "Portrait Model
of Mr. Charles S. Pabnell," M.P., has been added to Madame
Tussaud's Exhibition. Surely, Mr. Parnelx has done nothing that
can have entitled him to a position amongst celebrities associated in
a certain special Chamber of the establishment in Baker Street—as
yet i To do him an honour so very peculiar as that of placing
him there in effigy, seems, at least, premature. The Waxwork
Proprietors are not Astrologers; but this does seem like casting
Mr. Parnell's Chamber-of-Horrorsoope.

MR. GREENHORN'S EXPERIENCES.
Although: months have elapsed since the events
occurred to which the accompanying letter refers, I think
it may be found of sufficient interest to all my bachelor
friends who are blessed with female relatives, to justify
its insertion.
A few days after I had given my instructions to
the Liberal Haberdashers I sometime since alluded to,
I received, to my intense astonishment, a letter from
my Aunt, of which the following: is a copy :—
"My dear Joseph,
"I have received from Messrs. Isaacs and
Lawson a paroel of Silk, which, they inform me, they
have forwarded by your direction. I have examined
the worthless rubbish with an amount of astonishment
that I really find it quite impossible to express. I can
quite understand, my dear Nephew, the kindness that
impelled you to make me, as you fondly thought, a very
handsome present for my approaching birthday; but
the shameful way in whioh you have been swindled,
and induced to insult me in a way that I never could
have believed possible, worries and annoys me more than
I can express.
"It 'a a long- way, of course, from Truro to London,
and you know how I hate those nasty Railways, espe-
cially since I have been so lame, but I shall start by
the early train to-morrow morning, and we will go
together to those shameful swindlers, accompanied by
a Policeman, and let them see that we are not quite
such idiots in Cornwall as to be taken in by such an
impudent attempt at deception.
I hope the journey will not prove too much for my
strength; but I shall be able to stay with you three
or four days to recover myself. I shall bring my maid
with me, so we shall require two bed-rooms. It is, of
course, a great effort for me to make, but nothing
shall prevent my assisting you in punishing those in-
famous swindlers who have dared so to impose upon
your utter ignorance of these important matters.
"Your affectionate Aunt, "Tabitha Tbeveltan.''
My poor dear Aunt stayed with me a full week before
she was able to return home. It was certainly the longest
and. the most expensive, and I fear I must add, the most
untruthful week I ever experienced, and the worst of it
is that I also fear, from her somewhat severe manner at
leaving;, that my long week's sacrifice of comfort and
convenience, of boundless extravagance, and of ima-
ginative explanations was all thrown away.
I am going to Heme Bay for a few days' absolute
quiet and repose, and to recover my wonted serenity
after the fearful trial to whioh I have been subjected,
from whioh I draw this moral for my future guidance:—
Never buy a bargain in Silk; never make a present
to a distant Relation; and never have a spare bed-room
in a small establishment. Joseph Greenhobn.

AN EASTER HOLIDAY IN PARIS.
(Mems. from the Diary of a Home-Ruler.)
Monday.—Commencement of the Easter recess. Arrived in Paris
safe and sound. Preciom glad to be here, as my blundering fellow
oountrymen are always making awkward mistakes. As it was,
during the passage between Dover and Calais, I found one of these
donkeys taking aim at me with a revolver from under cover of the
paddle-box. When I remonstrated with him, he apologised, and
said he took me for quite a different Gentleman. Of course, we
know nothing about these mysterious bands, or rather we know they
do not exist, but still I do wish they would be more careful! It's
false economy to employ illiterate avengers because their services
can be procured cheaply.
Tuesday.—Took a walk in the Rue de Rivoli, and was accosted by
two men, who asked me "if I happened to be Mr. Gladstone?"
Replied, "Certainly not." _ They told me that they were delighted
to hear it, as they had received instructions to stab the Premier to
the heart, and were unwilling to make mistakes. Can't understand
the matter at all. Called upon M. Henri de Roceefort, and
repeated to him a speech I had composed to be delivered after the
recess. He expressed himself delighted with it. This was very
gratifying and flattering. The more so as the speech was delivered
in English, and Henri only speaks French. Going home to my
hotel, found a string of men standing in a row. They all had red
flags. One of them asked me if I happened to be Sir William
Harcourt, as if I were he and his companions were to signal to one
another my approach by waving their banners. Assured him I
was not Sir William Harcourt, but can't make out what it all
means.
Wednesday.—Met a few of my colleagues, and determined to do a
little business. Talked over the wrongs of Ireland for five minutes,
and then practised the national jig. Adjourned to pay a call upon
oertain of the fair sex. Behaved in the most elegant manner. As
i were dancing the jig we had practised in the morning, and just
we and the Ladies were warming to the work, half the house was
we
as we
blown down by dynamite. Hurried into the street to see what wag
the matter. Very angry. Fellow countryman most apologetic
Said that he and his mates had mistaken one of our number for
a Cabinet Minister. Well, what if he did? Most extraordinary!
Why blow up the house on that account? Fairly puzzled!
Thursday.—Another meeting with my colleagues. Put to the
vote—politics or beauty? Deoided unanimously in favour of the
latter. Had a fine time of it entirely. Accompanied distinguished
members of the fair sex to Versailles. Vastly polite to the member
peculiarly hypothecated to me. Was careful, however, to draw the
line. Did not wish to have the pain of refusing her. Coming back
to Paris, train left the line. Lady is terribly frightened, but not
hurt. Individual in a disguise-cloak apologised. He said he
thought that our fair companions were English Ladies. Hence the
mistake. He wouldn't have murdered an Irishwoman to save his
life. What could he mean?
Friday.—When we were breakfasting quietly at the Grand Hotel,
the entire floor mounted en masse like a balloon, and carried us into
the Champs Elysees. Gentleman in a black mask profuse in his
apologies. Some mistake. They had been tempted to do it by
seeing a large family party of English children entering the saloon.
Were unaware of our presence. Very angry. Man in mask retorted.
They hadn't had an advance for a long time 1 What did he mean?
He said that he and his mates were not going to do all the dirty
work, while we Left him at this point, as. he was evidently
becoming offensive. However, thought it advisable to leave Paris
immediately.
Saturday.—Back in London. Ready for the next Parliamentary
campaign. Outrages going on right and left. Don't, of course,
know in the least who the "miscreants" are. .But they must be
sharp fellows to think of such clever things. Funds of the League
in satisfactory condition. But still these outrages are terrible. Do
bo wonder who are the organisers.

NATURE'S PUZZLES.

A REAL EASTER HOLIDAY.
I was enabled on Friday, through the great kindness of two of the sons of
the friendly Councillor of whom I have had so often to speak, to enjoy on our
noble river, distinguished by our poets for ages past as the " Silver Thames,"
a day of the simplest and purest enjoyment. We started at about ten o'clock,
after a copious breakfast, and boldly walked to Mortlake. It is many years
sinoe I accomplished so herculean a feat—ex pede Serculem is, I think, the
correct quotation here—and proud enough I felt at itB accomplishment, and,
truth compels me to add, tired enough too. However, a oapital but economical
dinner at a neighbouring inn, the closed doors of which flew open like magic at
the word " Travellers," soon eet me to-rights, and we sauntered down to the
river, and chartered a boat. I believe "chartered" is the correct phrase, and
we were, consequently, the charter-parties; and it being my first appearance
in that oharacter, I of course endeavoured to look as much like a charter-party
as possible.
We started in a blaze of hot sunshine, which was, however, prevented from
being too oppressive by about the sharpest and keenest North-Easter that I
think I ever experienced. My two youthful companions rowed, of course, and
I, for the first time in all my chequered existence, undertook to steer. So
long as our course was quite clear, this did not seem a very difficult or com-
plicated operation. I had only to keep her nose straight, I was told, and I was
sure to be right. I, of course, had not the remotest idea whose nose was to be
kept straight, or how.I was to accomplish this necessary operation; but I found
if I pulled both the strings as hard as I could, .all seemed right, and so I
continued doing till my arms ached again.
But when we got further up the river, what with the sun, and the East wind,
and the other boats that would keep getting in our way, and would keep shout-
ing out, "Where are you coming to, Btupid?" "Does your mother know you're
out?" and other similar domestic inquiries, I got quite confused, and pulling
the wrong string by mistake, nearly got under the bough," I think they oafl
it, of what seemed to me quite a gigantic steamer; however, with that presence of
mind that rarely forsakes me for long, by pulling violently at the other string,
1 managed to run our boat right ashore, when, of course, we were safe. I had
been noticing for Borne time past that the water was rising rather rapidly in
our boat, and I now called my companions' attention to
the strange fact, and to the rather singular effeot thereof,
that my boots were thoroughly wet through. Upon
examination it was discovered that the boat was leaking
badly, but this seemed but a very trifling matter to
my young friends, for, jumping on to the adjacent mud-
bank and oalling to me to follow, we soon hauled our
outrigger ashore, cleared her out, turned her over,
launched her again, and there we were, "as right as
ninepence," as I was informed by our bough oar. My
utter inexperienoe of nautical phraseology prevents me
from thoroughly understanding how right ninepence is
generally considered to be, but as I was at that particular
moment sitting with a blazing Bun right in my eyes,
and a cutting North-Easter right in my left ear, and a
wet steering-rope in each cold hand, with my boots full
of muddy water, and my best trousers coated with black
mud nearly up to the knees, I think I would rather not
learn from a bitter experience what it is to be as right
as a shilling.
Our four hours' row. which, under my somewhat trying
circumstances might have proved just a trifle monoto-
nous, was agreeably varied by the necessity under which
we found ourselveB of running ashore on two other occa-
sions for the purpose of again emptying our leaky boat.
On remonstrating somewhat severely with the eminent
boat-builder from whom we had chartered our treacherous
craft, he coolly informed us that "as it was the werry
first time she had been out since she was laid up for the
winter, he was half afeard as she might just weep
a little."
We left him and his weeping outrigger, looking as
indignant as it is well possible to look with one's boots
and trousers smothered, bo to speak, with Thames mud,
and again sought refuge in our friendly inn, where a
liberal tea warmed and refreshed us, and enabled us to
make light of our threefold escape. My young friends
seemed to think it gave the one touch of adventure neces-
sary to a perfect day's amusement, and I have but little
doubt that repeated experiences of the same kind might
at length succeed in convincing me that, to walk seven
or eight miles on a stretch, and then to sit for four
mortal hours in a small, leaky boat, without even the
ordinary luxury of a cushion, in a bitter Easterly wind,
pulling with unaccustomed hands at two small ropes,
with your boots filled with muddy water, and your best
trousers plastered with Thames mud, and with all the
anxiety necessarily resulting from the responsibility of
knowing that you are the only one on board who knows
which way you are going, or by what dangers you are
I surrounded, at once satisfactorily answer the oft-repeated
question, "How to spend a Happy Day."

Oh where and oh where is my big Bulldog?
Oh where and oh where can he be?
With his Su-ze-rain-ty and his Con-ven-ti-on,
Oh where and oh where is he P
They set him to watch me, my tricks for to stop;
Oh where and oh where can he be?
But I guess he will never catch me on the hop,
And his bark is all fiddlededee.
I call him my dog, he would scare me, but can't;
I whistle, he '11 come, you will see,
With his tail 'twixt his legs, and his ears on the slant,
As docile a dog as can be.
My big Bulldog cannot know what he's about,
He seems in a bit of a fog.
If the dog were the stronger, he'd rule me, no doubt.
As it is, I shall just rule the dog.

HOME COMFORTS.
The following is a puzzle which appears
in the Daily Telegraph (March 26th) :—
BOARD and RESIDENCE, South Kensing-
ton. Near park, museum, rail, and omni-
s. Bath room. Home comforts. Terms for
partial from 18».; full from 21s.; married couple,
two guineas. Carpet dances.
Now, partial home comforts at eighteen
shillings appears reasonable, but full home
comforts at a guinea is decidedly cheap.
The final sentence puzzles us altogether,
"Carpet dances." Does it, indeed? Is
this one of the 11 home comforts'' P Possibly
the tables turn, the chairs chevy one an-
other, and the sideboard "sets to partners."
It would perhaps be somewhat perplexing,
all this frivolity of furniture, after a time.
Possibly we have 'made a mistake, and that
"Carpet dances" is a misprint for Carpe
diem.

Mr. Pinero has, we hear, seen the error of his way, and has rectorfied his mistake. The
aoting is said to be very good. We shall see. Among the numerous Matinees at the Gaiety
are two of considerable interest; one when Vice Versa" is to be played, and the other is Miss
Lindley's Matinie, when this Lady is to appear as Countess d'Autrevat in T. W. Robertson's
Ladies'1 Battle, and a young Irish Gentleman, Mr. H. Fitz-Pateick, is to essay the part of
Pat McNoggerty in That Rascal Pat. A new delineator of Irish character is a rarity, and
will be a great attraction for this entertainment, which should be called a Matinie and a
Patinee. It is on the Thirteenth. Opera Comique. Bondage, last Saturday, proved to be
a dull translation from the French by a " well-known London Author," whose name did not
appear. This was wise; had none of the Actors appeared, and the piece itself not been pro-

12 Noon.—"Well, here we are at Flatfoot Flats, with telescopes,
spectacles, and measures complete. Obeyed our orders in every
detail. The Professor and myself are
determined to sift the matter thoroughly,
and not to accept evidence at second-
hand. We have got a Metropolitan
Policeman in blue, a Volunteer in grey,
and a Militiaman in scarlet. Easily
find out for ourselves which is the best
colour. Soon see which is most con-
spicuous at a distance. The Professor
not only scientific but thoughtful. As
it is blowing hard, and feels bitterly
cold, he has brought with him a large
stone jar of whiskey. We have just
had a mug of it each, and are all the
better for it. The Polioeman, Volunteer,
and Militiaman are waiting for our orders.
1 p.m.—So far we have not obtained any very valuable result.
We started our three colour-wearers from our post of observation,
and told them to walk slowly away. To our great surprise they
became invisible almost immediately. By the aia of a telescope we
made out what we believed to be the Policeman at about a thousand
yards' distance. Subsequently, it turned out that what we had
taken for the constable was a windmill. In like manner, a goose
passed for the Militiaman, and a donkey for the Volunteer. Sow-
ever, the test was scaroely a fair one. It appears that immediately
after leaving us, our three assistants, instead of following out our
instructions, adjourned to a public-house, where we found them a little
later. We were very much annoyed, and would have been seriously
angry had not the whiskey proved an excellent protector from the
severity of the weather. It ib wonderful what a lot of ardent spirit
you can consume in a Btrong rarefied atmosphere when you have the
ohance—I should say when Science demands the sacrifice.
2 p.m.—Keally very muoh annoyed. Policeman and Militia-
man had to take Volunteer to station-house. This disgraceful,
as Scientists should keep sober. Policeman and Militiaman
came baok. Both of them were more than one. Brought other
people—somehow. Don't quite know why—but that's idea. Pro-
fessor and I had more whiskey. Keeps out cold. Colour of Polioe-
man, blue—Militiaman doa't quite know what to say. Looked for
them all over the place, then found them fast asleep out of sight.
This playing fool—don't know?
2'30 p.m.—Lost Policeman. Don't know what become him.
Militiaman (good fellow, Militiaman) awfully sorry. He weeps like
child. So does Professor; so do I. Saddest thing in life! All had
whiskey. Keep oold out. So unhappy 1
3 p.m.—Dishided! Meantersay—de-ci-ded I Decided I Know
what about! Shouldshayso! Likersee man say don't! Won't be
inshulted! Going home! What's good staying? Finished whiskey!

THE SIXPENNY "WIRE."
[Dr. Cameron carried a resolution in the House on Thursday night to the
effect that the minimum charge for Inland Postal Telegrams should be
reduced to sixpence.]
A Sixpenny Telegram 1 Cameron won;
It passed in the Commons, and now the trick's done;
And be any message of weal or of woe,
No shilling's required, for a " tizzy" 'twill go;
And all but the Post-Office clerks will admire
That boon to the public—a Sixpenny " Wire."
So now, when you think that you'll dine at the Club,
And cut in perchance at the casual " rub,"
A sixpence is all that in future you'll spend
To make known to your wife that you 're "kept by a friend,"
But she needn't sit up, for that nurses her ire;
And you '11 soon say it all with a Sixpenny " Wire."
So cheap will the telegrams be, that in time
The lover will send oft sixpenn'orths of rhyme:
Oh
pet
at
each
long
hour
of
absence
I
groan
Send
but
twenty
dear
words
just
to
comfort
your
own
Thus the poet, you see, sweeps the Post-Office lyre,
And he '11 get it all in to a Sixpenny "Wire."
The rise and the fall of the Stocks and the Shares,
The Bank-rate, the tricks of the Bulls and the Bears,
The orders for dinners, for boxes and stalls.
For coals and for claret, for dresses, for balls,
In short all that woman or man can desire,
Will soon be obtained by a Sixpenny " Wire."
The New Sentries.—The Sentries at the New Law Courts are
posted every morning regularly. On inquiry at St. Martin's-le-
Grand, Our Reporter was unable to ascertain at what hour a Sentry,
posted in the Strand, would be delivered in the City. One of the
duties of the Sentries at the New Law Courts is to assist any Judge,
when called upon to do so, in charging a Jury. He will nrge upon
them the legal point of the bayonet. The few
are exonerated from Sentry duty.

It cannot, good Mr. Plimsoll,
be denied that there is some
justice in a portion of the plea
you put forward at your Exeter
Hall meetings. You said that
"no doubt they were nuisanoes;
but until a better mode of ven-
tilating the District Railway
could be found," you contended,
"they should not be removed.
Very well; but has not suoh a
mode of ventilating a Railway
much more difficult to ventilate
than the District Railway been
already found? Couldn't Sir E.
Watkin point it out to you?
The proposed Railway under the
Channel, if made, will have to
be ventilated somehow without
ohimneys, and can't he tell how f
If he can, let that method of ven-
tilation for the District Railway
be adopted forthwith, and then

"KNIGHTS AT THE PLAY."
This is not d propos of Mr. Dutton Cook's latest work on the
Drama, but of the suggestion recently made in Truth that Mr.
Henhy Irtino should be knighted, as a compliment to the entire
Theatrical Profession." This is, in a general way, true,—as coming
from Truth it sshould be; but were a leader of the Chancery Bar to
be made a Baronet, it would directly be a compliment to that
branch of the legal profession; and so a Knighthood for Mr. Ikying
would be a direct compliment to the Tragio and Melodramatic
branches of the Theatrical Profession with which he is more inti-
mately associated. At all events, to knight Mr. Ikying would be no
direct compliment to Mr. J. L. Toolk, whom we must take as repre-
senting the Low Comedy department; nor would it be, directly, a
compliment to Mr. Habbt Payne, who now represents the Panto-
mimic Art, which, indeed, may well claim to be not a branch but
the very parent stem of all Theatrical Art.
Arise then, Sir Henrt Irving; arise, Sir John Lawrence Toole;
and arise, Sir Harry Payne, the last to wear the order of the noble
House of Gbimaldi. Sir Julius, we believe, still has his "Benefit
Conoert," so in the Theatrical Profession it will not be derogatory to
the new titles to advertise "The Benefit Knights." But how about
the Ladies ?" The spindle-side " must be recognised. Is it to be
Baroness Ellen Terry and Baroness Nellie Fakren? We submit
the question to Garter King of Arms, and the Authorities of the
Heralds' College. _
At the Archbishop of Canterbury's Enthronisation, there were
some few of the Clergy "indulging," said the Daily Telegraph report,
"investments of a more or less pronounced character." What on earth
does this mean? We are looking forward with interest to some pic-
torial explanation of these strange garments in the Illustrated papers
this week. In the same account we read how "some brass instru-
ments, in the hands of surplioed musicians, added greatly to the
musical effect"—but probably not to the picturesqueness. A man in
a surplice blowing an ophicleide or working at a trombone must have
had rather a oomio appearance, but the artful Reporter takes good
care not to mention this.

HAT ETUDE OF THE HOUSE.
{Before Prayers.)
House of Commont, Thursday, March 29. — Members met
again to-day after Easter Holidays. Don't look so pleased as
they should. At first, little gleam of joy at discovery that Head-
Master wasn't present. Bat he came in towards six o'clock, and
made a little speech on debate that happened to be to fore at the
moment; then, like a wise man, went oft home.
"Just let people know I 'mhere, you see, Toby," saidhe. "Carious
it should have happened that debate on Woods and Forests going on
when I looked in. Rather expected it would be something else.
But doesn't matter mueh, you know. Give me fire minutes' notice,
and you may choose your own topic."
Met General Fielder in Library, looking more woebegone than
other people.
"What's the matter, General?" I asked, oheerily. "Has some-
one been republishing your speeches during electoral campaign?"
"No," said the gallant General. "Worse than that. I've gone
out of the oratorical line. Haven't opened my mouth since I came
into the House. But energies must find some outlet. So I've gone
into literature. Written an article for the April Nineteenth Century,
oalled " What Shall I Do With My Son?"
"Capital subject. Specially interesting in domestic circles."
"Yes," said the General, ruefully, "that's just where it's created
a stir. The young dog says, if I don't withdraw it, he '11 send one to
the Fortnightly entitled, 'What Shall I Do With My Father.'"
Only cheerful man about is the lighthearted O'Shba. Kilmainham
mystery beginning to pall. Has taken up the Romance at the Fisheries.
Insists upon knowing Hons Sfcretary's candid opinion of affair.
"Home Secretaries never give candid opinions," says Habcoubt.
Whereupon O'Shea pulls out pistol of Adjournment of House
holds it at Harcourt's head, and threatens to fire unless he replies.
Sir William's answer very neat. "Account of the case rests," he
says, "on statement of Lady Florence Dixie. Investigations of
the police have not resulted in discovering any further circumstance
in confirmation."
"Very neat," said Sir R. Cross. "' Any further circumstance in
confirmation' is good."
O'Shea satisfied. Withdraws pistol, and exit Lady Florence.
Pretty good joke in its way. But some jokes, like every dog, have
their day, and this has had a week.
Mr. Schreiber wants to fill up vacant panels in Centre Hall with
Mosaic pictures of patron Saints of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.
St. George already there trampling down Dragon, whose silver
scales gleam in the gaslight, House doubtful. Who would Mr.
Schreibkr propose to represent the three countries? Mr S. thinks
Morgan Lloyd done up in coat of mail might represent Wales.
Sir Georg e Balfoub with claymore in hand ana shield on arm would
represent Scotland. Whilst, of coarse, Joseph Gillis would repre-
sent Ireland. Mr. Cavendish Bentinck opposes scheme altogether.
Mosaic-work not true Art. "It's rococo."
"Yah, yah, yah!" cries Alderman Fowler. "What it rococo?"
he subsequently and confidentially asked Sir W. Lawson.
"Capital beverage," said the Hon. Bart. "Strongly recommend
it to you, Alderman. Absolutely pure, made only from the nibs,
don't you know."
Alderman faintly said " Yes." But really distressed at his own
rashness. "Must be careful in future," he said, smiting himself on
the chest. "Must restrain this too-ready cheer when Gentleman
speaks from Front Bench. Rococoa, quotha I I suppose that's what
they'll fill the loving-cup with when the new Government of
London comes in. Ho I ho 1"
House feared another explosion in Parliament Street. Only the
Alderman scornfully smiling.
Business done.—Discussed Civil Servioe Estimates. Peter great
at expenses in connection with Royal Palaces. Laboucherk wants
to know what becomes of the yearlings of the Royal stud-house. Ran-
dolph inquisitive about expenditure in maintaining and repairing
Marlborough House. Pounding away from Eight tillTwelve. Alto-
gether Shaw-Lepevre, in charge of votes, spent a bad quatre heures.
Friday.—Mr. Arthur Abnold disclosed particulars of his Parlia-
mentary Reform Bill to a listening Senate. Part of listening Senate
undertaken, at short not ice,', by eleven Gentlemen on the Liberal
side, and thirteen on the other, including Joseph Gillis, who
remains in state of deep despondency.
'' Rouse up, Joseph !" I said. '1 Get thee away to some place where
the company is light-hearted, and the merry jest goes round."
"No, no!" said Joey B. "This suits me best. 'Tis soothing
and quiet, and, I dare say, instructive."
So Joseph sat through it all, and when, at twenty minutes to
eight, the dreary performance came to an inevitable close, he was
one of those whom the Speaker counted.
"Did you see that?" he said, with something of old slyness.
"Speaker began to count from the Treasury Bench, and Habcoubt
only man there. Note we know who's Number One."
Business done.—Night wasted.

THE GOOD NEW TIMES.
{A Cover-side Forecast for 1889.)
It certainly promised to be the best meet of the season.
Not a cloud in the sky; the earth hard as a flat-iron, and three
inches and a half of goodrock-ioe on every_ bit of water within twenty
miles—it was just the sort of prime sporting weather to gladden the
heart of a thorough-going old hedge-row Nimrod, like Sir Joeam
TANTiwr. And as he came quietly jogging up on his familiar white
olook-work cob, wound up within an ace of bursting his spring, an
involuntary shout of "Toicks, ye ho! Forrard!" went up from the
assembled field. The old Baronet drew his blankets and hot bottles
closer around him, and gave a friendly nod of recognition right and
left with a Bly twinkle in his eye. He was answered with a well-
bred roar of laughter.
"Ready, as usual, for a snapped wheel, and a five-hours' stick on
my side in a freezing turnip-field," he said, with a cheery wink;
"and how are you, Lady Jeshib?"
A neat little horsewoman waltzed up on a beautiful mechanical
creature. Frodsham's well-known name was stamped over its eye,
and as the fair Diana, dexterously screwed round its off ear, it gave
a pretty wheeling stagger to the right, with a natural up-and-down
steamboat motion that instantly elicited the admiration of the hunt.
But at this moment all eyes were turned in another direction.
With an uncontrolled rush a splendid electric bay had bowled in
among the riders, and knocking several over so that they lay on their
sides, running down, with their legs galloping wildly in the air,
landed its owner with a sudden thud, through the walls of a barn,
into the midst of a haystack that fortunately happened to be standing
on the other side.

Black and White.
Mb. Leigh Hunt Wallace,
lecturing on "The Martyr-
doms of Modern Dress," came
to the conclusion that the
colour of our drees should at
all times be white! One feels
disposed to exclaim, like
Scott (with a difference)—
"0 for one hour of Wallace
white!"
And of genuine British black
fog also,—just to prove the
exquisite compatibility of the
two!
Dames who have with Wallace
dressed,
Dames by London smut-falls

But the garments would have
to, or they would not long be
white.
"Confound it!" said the latest oomer, who was no other than
Lord Spavin on his brand-new thorough-bred. Accumulator, "the
beast is always playing me that trick; and I thought I turned his
tail the right way! By Jove, this comes of tooling out without the
printed directions." The Noble Sportsman wrenched with some
uncertainty at the animal's switch as he spoke. But he was again
at fault. In another minute it had backed, with a Bhower of sparks,
in a direct line straight right in among the dogs, and was only
brought to a standstill against the stump of a gigantio oak, between
which and itself it sharply jammed the Vicar, who had been placidly
watohing the lively scene on his old-fashioned steam-mare, Boiler.
There was a smart shock or two, an upset of red-hot cinders, an
oath, and some burnt fingers and calves; but the field soon settled
down to business, for the Master of the Hunt now joined the party
with his mahogany box.
"The new musical fox from Paris!" everybody shouted, as the
welcome offioial carefully produoed the wonderful mechanical crea-
ture, winding it up slowly as he advanced.
"It plays three overtures, two sets of quadrilles, a polka, a waltz,
and the ' Dead March in Saul' " he observed with some pride, as he
set the carefullv brushed but life-like brute in their midst, " and so,
if by some mischance it runs to earth, we shall at least know where
it is. Besides, it has a little fountain of superior Jockey-Club
Bouquet in its forehead," he added, at the same time turning on a
small silver stop-cock, cleverly placed near the creature's chin.
"Tally Ho I I fancy we can't Quite lose the Scent." A delicious
Bond-Street perfume instantly filled the crisp oover-side air, as the
overture to 1'annhiiuser merrily tinkled out with pleasing precision.
Some of the paok howled, but another rapturous responsive shout of
"Yoicks 1" showed with what a keen sportsman-like relish the field
appreciated these arrangements for a glorious run. It was a moment

of thrilling excitement, and all, as if by a common instinct, gave
their mechanical hacks a final screw.
And now the pack and their medical adviser hurried to the front.
They were a miscellaneous, but talented and highly-trained family,
and were of all kinds and sizes. This was a natural result of the
new condition of things. The old-fashioned foxhound was extinct.
Declining, when the famous Bill passed, to follow across country a red-
herring on a tricyole, the first roughly-suggested substitute for
Reynard, he even showed greater repugnance to the more perfect and
perfumed modern contrivance. So the Circus-monger had to take
the matter in hand, and soon every hunting county was once more
alive with the old hue and cry, though pitched in a somewhat
different key. But the Skipley Foodies were famous from Warwick-
shire to Sahoeb's.
And they were in full force to-day. _ Not that they all were of the
famous moustachio'd and trimmed-tail breed. Among them were
huge heavy-witted St. Bernards, over-fed Maltese, aged Sleuth
Hounds, a retired Newfoundland or two, toothless Mastiffs, and a
good average sprinkling of the common street-dog, ready to pick up
a living anyhow from hand to mouth, and not above chasing a scent-
bottle for a mile or two in the open, for the price of a pound of tripe
at the finish.
But the Skipley were popular. There were few of them that
couldn't shoulder a musket or walk on a barrel at a pinch. The
Master of the Hunt gave them their tongue. They had it in the
shape of sandwiches, and now they were ready. The Doctor took a
last look at them. "A run this morning will not injure their health
or affect their spirits," he said, cheerily, "and I can sign the requi-
site certificate for the officers of the Protection Society. Houp-ld!
Off you go!"
In another second the mechanical fox had dashed forward with a
pleasant springy whizz that set every sporting heart in the field
beating twenty to the dozen. "Forrard 1 Yoioks 1 Tally! tally-ho I
There he goes 1" and the pack, some curvetting, some jumping
through imaginary hoops in the hedges, some even walking on their
forelegs, but all rolling along in well-fed and highly-trained indif-
ference at a comfortable pace, followed the ingenious toy with all the
intelligent regularity of a three-hundredth-night's performance.
Not so the gallant sporting assemblage who hurried after them.
Headed by the hardy Sir Jobam, these showed that, in them at
least, the spirit of the Good New Days was not yet dead. At every
fence, at every ditch, at every slight inequality of the ground, some
county champion had come to grief. Here a burst spring, there an
exploded boiler had done their work; while further afield some un-
manageable bit of mechanism had carried its helpless rider across
the lawn and into the breakfast-room of a country mansion, from
which he could only retire with a hearty laugh, to be followed up.
however, by a threat of heavy damages from the exasperated
owner.
Still the fox, true to the prospectus of the inventor and patentee,
kept on his way, and turning down a spinney, and still playing The
Lancers, headed away bravely for Combe Hanger Junction; finally
running to earth in the signal-switch, and by sticking between the
points, stopping the 4 50 down express for a good three-quarters of
an hour.
The pack meantime, not caring much about the scent, had cleverly
lost it at Friars-M in tun, and making for a cat's-meat cart at DiDgley
Bottom, were only recovered in the course of the following week at
the Dogs' Home; while Lord Spavln, who had kept up with them
by running Accumulator backwards with the safety-valve down,
was ultimately blown through the roof of the Town-Hall at Little
Pendleton, and coming down on the head of the Clerk, had a narrow
escape with his collar-bone. And so ended a day of most enjoyable
and delightful sport.

said, "You have degraded me; but I will pay you out" Then she
drove off to the back street in Soho.
Her interview with Mr. Macligoer, the celebrated Stage-trainer,
was in every way satisfactory. I understand your Grace
thoroughly," he said; "you wish to show Sooiety that you can not
only lead but amuse itf" "Precisely." "After three months'
study with me, yon will be in a position to play Juliet—at a Matinie.
You will probably be hooted. Still I will guarantee you a six days'
engagement somewhere as Mrs. Bouncer. After that the matter
really rests in your own hands; but unless I am much mistaken
in my tutorial powers, you will finish up as a Second Chambermaid
in the Provinces. I presume that your Grace will play under your
own name?"
The Dowager-Duchess smiled sweetly. Mr. Macligoer bowed.
"That will pull twenty pounds into the house once," he said, "and
prove an agreeable and permanent surprise to your family."
From that moment the "study " went on unceasingly, and at the
end of the appointed period, the eventful Matinee arrived. As the
sagacious Mr. Macligoer had predicted, though she was supported
by the Romeo of Mr. Bilton Skirts, his fair but portly pupil was
hooted well back into her chamber in the Balcony Soene. Nor did
better success attend her Mrs. Bouncer. On the fifth night, as she
was delivering her last speech to Cox, a huge green missile was hurled
at her with telling effect by a critical patron in the Gallery. Some
sympathisers who had oomeVith paper to the Stalls oried, " Shame!"
But she took the hint. The name of " Honoria, Dowager-Duchess
of Boxburgh," appeared no more in the bills of the Vulgarity.

Some years after this little episode in her life, she was seated in
her own private boudoir at Ballchamps, and idly turning over the
treasured contents of a secret drawer. She had just taken from its
recesses a large withered cabbage, and was looking at it with a
curious pout, when her son-in-law (they had halved the family
diamonds now, and the solicitor, Mr. Purdle, was nearly dry)—
entered quite suddenly. It was too late to conceal the tell-tale
vegetable, and the quick well-bred eye of the young Peer rapidly
noted the embarrassment his entry had occasioned. He gave his
Mother-in-law a gentle kiss.
"Let us "burn it," he said, softly, trying to lift it; "that is," he
added, as he felt its weight, "if it does not put the fire out."
The Dowager Duchess dropped a restraining finger on his arm.
"No—no," she said, with a well-studied calm. "No, no,
Harold. I would keep it as a good friend—would that others like
me could meet with many such!—that first reminded me not to
meddle in business with which I had no possible concern. Heavy as
it was, and it was heavy, it was but the meet reward"
"Of your laudable ambition?"
"No—of my vulgar caprice.'"
"A REGULAR OWD AN' OWD 'UN."
According to a Police report, a speech of the good old
Aldermanio sort was lately spoken at the
Mansion House by Sir Thomas Own en in
sentencing a disorderly open-air preacher to
a month's imprisonment for "oreating a
disturbance in the area in front of St. Paul's
Cathedral during divine service, and refus-
ing to leave when required." The excellent
\ %Sjfi^sRl^l Alderman informed the Prisoner that:—"It
/Cxu&SgXte*^ was very foolish of him to preach outside of
^ /jfk^iTy^' St. Paul's Cathedral, as there was plenty of
EToS^ preaching going on inside." This happy
* ^rar ™^lw^~ observation recalls the sallies, of late some-
what fallen into desuetude, by which Civio
Magistrates were commonly accustomed to excite mirth in other
and merrier days. The fine of a fiver, for disturbing the congre-
gation and doing a considerable amount of damage, was another
Aldermanio joke. Take care. The Seldom-at-Home Secretary has
his eye on Municipal Magistracy.

MEDALS AND MUFTI.
[It has been finally decided that officers may wear all their
miniature in evening drets.]
Shade of great Dizzy, if he could make shade,
Who to all shine and shimmer was so partial.
Descend, and see what vast advance we've made
In matters martial!
Gone, Castlereagh's " so distingue " black;
When next Ambassadors are named to fib on
Their country's servioe, neck, and breast, and back
Shall be all ribbon.
No more we may contrast our nice and neat
Costume with that in vogue across our borders;
Disorder's coming fast when the elite
Stoop to low orders;
When Britons' staid sobriety of dress
Shall give place unto variegated aores
Of spangles, and our wicked sons look less
Like undertakers.
The waltz, however, may acquire new charms
For frisky matrons and for flirters single,
When, twirling in the arms of men of arms,
The Jingoes jingle;
And just below, the bright eyes thus are bound,
If they 're polite, to Beek a looking-glass in
Their own, where there's a brightness just as round,
And marked: Kassassin.
Let no brave use a bushel for his light,
Be it but rush-light; there is no true rising
Without, for men who trade like men who fight,
Self-advertising.

AP-PY THOUGHT.
A prize is to be given at their next Eisteddfod by the Cardiff
Committee for the best Welsh Pantomime Libretto. Our Own Panto-
mimist, Ap-Jones, is in this, though he Bays he will not compete
against Mr. Osborne Morgan, or Sir Lewis Morris if they are
going in for it, so as to give them a chance. Ap-Jones's first notes
are sounded, and as an instalment he sends us the following sugges-
tions, on which he is going to work his libretto:—
Bad Spirits—The Wolshers, Welsh Sharpers, and Flying Welsh
Harpies. Good Spirits—the usual ones, but not to be summoned
from vasty deep cellars on Sunday. Mortals—Ap-Thomas, Ap-
Morgan, Ap-David, with chorus, We are an Appy Family; we
are, we are, we are!"
Grand Procession of The March of the Men of Garlick.
Sensation Scene—The Shipwreck: Springing a Leek.
The King of the Bigheads will be Sir Watkin Pudding, and the
female interest will be centred in the Maid of Llangollen. The
Pantomime will be finally submitted to Ap-Harbjs, and, if he Ap-
proves, it will be produced with new scenery, dresses, and Ap-point-
ments. Clown by an Ap-Rhryl Fool.
One of the Light-Fingered Class.—A Lady with small taper
fingers. This would account for cases of Kleptomania.

HOME-TRUTHS FROM ABROAD.
{A Long Way after Browning.')
"Oh, to be in England
Now that April's .there.
And whoever wakes in England
Sees some morning," in despair,
There's a horrible fog i' the heart o' the town,
And the greasy pavement is damp and brown;
While the rain-drop falls from the laden bough,
In England—now 1

"And after April when May follows,"
How foolish seem the returning swallows.
Hark how the EaBt wind sweeps along the street,
And how we give one universal sneeze!
The hapless lambs at thoughts of mint-sauce bleat,
And ducks are conscious of the coming peas.
Lest you should think the Spring is really present,
A biting frost will come to make things pleasant,
And though the reokless flowers begin to blow,
They'd better far have nestled down below;
An English Spring sets men and women frowning,
Despite the rhapsodies of Robert Browning!

were taken at the Enthronisation of the Archbishop of
Canterbury. It was at first proposed by an Extreme

be immediately rejected. _ Among other interesting disco-
veries connected with this ceremony, it has been ascer-
tained with tolerable certainty that about the period of
the Reformation the title of the See was slightly altered,

LITTLE SARAH AND HER YOUTHFUL SALLIES.
[One or Two more of Them.)
The highly entertaining extracts from the renowned Sabah's
forthcoming Ma Vie de Theatre," furnished last week by a daily
Contemporary, giving, as they do, a brief insight into the extra-
ordinary preoooity of her early years, have, as was to be expected,
only whetted the publio appetite for some further acquaintance with
that interesting period of her life.
Indeed, if the publishers now and then allow a favoured corre-
spondent or two to have a judicious peep at these very advanced sheets,
there is no saying what the first week's sale of the book may not
realise. Here, for instance, is a bit, dealing with a still more remote
epoch in the career of the remarkable genius whose slightest doings
are soon to be matters of European interest.
M. Jules Chahetie merely began his fragmentary excerpta in the
atmosphere of the Bchoolroom. The following little passage goes
even further, and takes the reader straight to the nursery. The
incidents are, of course, commonplace enough, and such as might
have been expected under the circumstances; still, they are
characteristic.
"The moment," says Sarah Bernhardt, "I was installed in my
cradle, my charaoter underwent another complete and radical change.
Hitherto I had merely stared at a magnificent fresco of 'Nero
Playing at Skittles with Jehoiakim in the Areopagus^ that used to
hang suspended from the ceiling of my mother's bedroom, in a
dreamy state of passive disgust. Now, 1 seemed to require aggres-
sive action. I began by eating my coral, whistle, bells, and all.
Then I olutohed at everything. I had torn a few sheets and blankets
to shreds, but. my first regular onset was made at my nurse's front
hair. Every particle of this I pulled out in firm tiny handfuls
by the roots. My Great-great-grand-uncle, who was always walking
about on all fours and imitating the screech of a cockatoo, with a
hearthbroom down his neck, to amuse me, tried feebly to intervene.
I beat him about the head with a couple of feeding-bottles, and he
got quietly under the sofa. This made M. Z laugh.
"'What shall we do with her ?' he said, holding his sides, in his
brutally vulgar manner, 'she can't keep on her legs. What do you
say to making her a Stewardess on a Boulogne Steamboat P' At
that moment my mother's five maiden Aunts, pretty, airy, curly-
headed, nimble-kneed little soubrettes, danced in, and struck an atti-
tude round the foot of my oradle. But the Doctor (he was the oldest
friend of the family) had given me the kitchen-poker to play with,
and I soon made a pass or two among them that sent them oapering
off to the other end of the room. So sped my babyhood away. All
my happiness was in that poker, and I was always hitting somebody
over the head with it, and I hit hard."
There is a further little story of how the youthful Sarah, while
cutting her second front tooth, carved a colossal group of "Hercules
strangling the Infant Hydrants" out of a simple block of Aberdeen
granite with a blunt razor: and also some further details of her well-
known feat of paving the Rue Rivoli with asphalts one hot summer's
evening when no one was looking. Most amusing, too, is the account
of the witty praotical joke she at last managed to play on her would-
be tormentor, M. Z , with two quarts of boiling lead, on his
eighty-third birthday. This should be read to be enjoyed. Altogether
the volume promises to be a most delightful one, and by anticipation
we already take off our hat to its spirited Editor, M. Dekenbouro.
Paradoxical.
Something's wrong with the " rule of the road " out at sea,
Or else our ship-steerers are foolish and feokless.
More wreokless, perhaps, the great ooean might be,
Were those who sail on it less reckless.
New Reading.—John Bull reading the perpetual iteration of
Conservative oratory, complains that his Tory repeats himself"
rather too much.
High Spirits.—When are Spirits like Axioms ?—When they a e
"above proof," to be sure.

KING MOB!
King Mob as ever on mischief bent,
In a land of freedom pitched his tent,
In every capital round the world.
His blood-stained banner King Mob unfurl'd.
As a cowardly cur and a secret spy,
With a treacherous hand and a devilish eye,
He stalked unseen and with bated breath,
He marked the Monarohs of earth for death.
King Mob in civilisation's eight,
Proclaimed his gospel of dynamite,
For one or other he laid his snare,
"Invinoible " here and " Nihilist" there.
In reckless fashion he flung his net
That was proof against sword and the bayonet:
What matter, he said, if the innocent fall,
Be they women or children, murder all I
He oame at last over land and sea,
To the home of peace and the island free.
A spirit of discontent he oast,
And tore the page from a nation's past;
He spread the terror of force and fist,
And flattered the impudent Atheist;
Having preached up crime as his soul thought best,
He was treated by law as an idle jest I
Wherever he came and whenever he spoke,
They took King Mob for an idle joke;
When he entered a churoh, and began to swear,
He was only considered a harmless bear;
And a Magistrate ready with courteous whine,
Let His Majesty off with a simple fine.
Red-handed caught at the dynamite store,
The House of Commons began to roar 1
Beware, King Mob I for the time has come
For Britons to strike—and to strike right home.
The days are over for empty sneers
When houses tumble about our ears;
It's a little too late to hold our breath,
With a mighty Metropolis mined with death.
But rebels will tremble and laughter cease
When the Hangman's knot—is the Bond of Peace!

Mrs. Ramshotham is delighted to hear of tbe establish-
ment of the Tine Club, which she thinks is evidence of a
strong Anti-Blue Ribbon Army Association. Now, she
says, she begins to understand what has lately been
alluded to in the papers as " The Tipple Alliance.'
There is a small rush on to the Stage just now of
talented Amateurs. Not vanity, but a praiseworthy
desire to realise a modest competency is their motive.
That they deserve to attain their objeot is evidenced by
the public display of their incompetency.
A WORD FOR THE DOCTORS.
Tex Vivisection Abolition Bill was talked out the other day, and,
as we do not wish to see the progress of medical science checked, we
cannot regret that the proposal was lost. The whole question lies in
a nutshell. Vivisection, as the law stands, can only be praotised
under very stringent regulations and the authority of a licenoe
granted by the Home-Office, which in very rare oases allows experi-
ments to be made without anaesthetics. Only one per cent, of the
investigations made equals the pain of an ordinary surgical opera-
tion. And what does the world owe to Vivisection? The discovery
of the circulation of the blood, the antiseptic Surgery of the present
day, the famous operation by which Mr. Spencer Wells and others
have saved the lives of many hundreds of women; all these, and a
thousand other benefits we owe to the experiments which it is now
proposed to abolish. As Mr. Caxtwright said during the debate—
we prefer to quote him instead of a medical man like Dr. Platfair—
"Professor Listbr's discoveries had revolutionised surgical science, and it
was said he had reduced the mortality of man by 7 or 8 per cent., and yet
on account of the restrictions surrounding the provisions of the present Act,
he had been obliged to go abroad in order to prosecute his invaluable researches.
In the Lakson case the clinching evidence which brought about a conviction
was derived from an experiment on a living animal .... If this Bill were
passed into law, experiments would be made on human frames and in the
rudest form. In the nineteenth century the hon. and learned Member asked
them to prohibit investigation, to annihilate inquiry, and to say scienoe was
a thing that must be curbed."
No cases of cmeltv under the existing Aots can be cited as occurring
in this country, all the horrors of whioh we read takingplace in Conti-
nental cities where there are no restrictions. As Sir William Har-
court said, the question is, "Whether man as the superior animal
had a right to use animals for his benefit P" Of course that can
only be answered in one way, but the Anti-Vivisectionists rush off
into shameless abuse of a noble profession, and do their cause no
good by it. Sir William Hakcourt well summed up the debate
when he said—
"They must bring a little common sense to bear on this question. They
must look at it in the light of experience, and he ventured to say that true
humanity was on the aide of these eminent men, many of whom were among
the moat tender-hearted members of society. He was satisfied that under the
administration of the existing law very little pain was inflicted, and that
what pain was inflicted was under such securities and guarantees that it was
not only in the course of experiment, but was abundantly justified."
Mr. Punch yields to no one in his detestation of cruelty. But crimes
must not remain undiscovered, our children must not die of zymotic
diseases, and our wives and sisters perish for the want of the skill
and the knowledge that have been obtained by humane operators
from Viviseotiou—conducted, be it remembered, in ninety-nine cases
out of a hundred with the administration of anaesthetics.

A LITTLE MISTAKE.

IF IT 'S FOR rOVRSELFES, I WOULD SAT, Eon't TAKE IT I"
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Home of Commons, Monday, April 1.—Very curious how Sir R.
Cboss objeots to people smiling, muoh less laughing. Whenever he
addresses the House always keeps his eye fixed upon Right Honour-
able Gentlemen on Treasury Benoh. If anyone smiles he's sure to
hear of it. Dodson always safe, but Habcoubt constantly offending,
and Mr. Gladstone has been speoially reprimanded. Last night
Sir Richard on his legs making disjointed remarks on Criminal
Appeal Bill. Stopping suddenly, with head on one side and gather-
ing olouds darkening his brow, he exclaimed, "I hear someone
Bmile." Terrible moment of suspense. Expected some trembling
man to be given up by his affrighted companions, and soundly
birched before the whole school. But danger passed over. After
listening intently for a second and hearing no more smiles, Sir
Richabd went on, not quite satisfied, but baflled.
"A strangely chequered oareer, Cross's," Mr. Charles Russell
mused. "Heaven intended him for a schoolmaster, his neighbours
made him Chairman of Quarter Sessions, and Dizzt projected him
into the Home Offioe. But scratch the ex-Home Secretary and you
iind the schoolmaster."
Very interesting tali with Randolph. He's been issuing another
manifesto. The Count de Chambord nothing to him in this kind of
literature. Prince Napoleon not a patch on him.
"Yes," said Baron de Worms, ruefully eyeing my young friend
as he sits below the Gangway, carefully dressed for dinner; "but
Prince Napoleon was straightway cast into prison."
"Of course Nobthcote 'b done for now," I said to Lord Randolph,
"and the bourgeois placemen, the honourable tadpoles, the Irish
lawyers, and the rest, are out of the question. Seems to me choice
grown exceedingly limited. But would Balfour do to succeed Sir
Stafford?"
"Afraid not," said I»rd Randolph. "He'srather young, and
whatyou may call pretty. Wants backbone."
"Wolff?"
"Ah! Wolff's a good fellow. 8peaks very good French, and
knows the mouths of the Danube. But I am not sure that the Party
would follow him. He'd make an excellent Under-Seoretary for
Foreign Affairs. In faot, I have promised him that when I in
Bhort, Wolff isn't thinking of the Leadership."
"Well, there's Gobst. Do you think he's capable of 1 agitating
Scotland and arresting the attention of the Midlands'?"
"I do not," said Randolph, with firmness. "Gobst is a little
lacking in imagination, and his humour is a trifle musty. I remember
him once saying to me he couldn't understand what Bourse meant
by impossibility of drawing up indictment against a whole people.
'Entirely a matter of fee,' the dear old Chappie said, quite
seriously."
"Then choice beoomes quite too utterly narrowed."
"I say nothing about that, Toby. But a Leader is a man who can
lead, and if there is a Party in this House well disciplined, it may be
the one I have had something to do with."
Business done.—Read Criminal Appeal Bill a Second Time.
Tuesday.—" Cave Caine-m.'" Sir Staffobd Nobthcote whis-
pered in Mr. Lowtheb's ear, as that gay young Knight rode forth,
like young What's his name, to make a speech or two in the Easter
reoess. But it was no use. I never posed as a cautious person,"
James plaintively observed to the audience at Kirby Moorside.
After which confession he ran a-muck at Grand Committees. Declared
they were packed by Birmingham Caucus (of whom it seems Sir
John Mowbray is Chairman) and more than hinted that when Bills
came back they must be gone through over again in the House.
Calne going to put question on subject.
"Most unfortunate tendency this of Jemmy's to blurt out things,"
Bays Mr. W. H. Smith. "What the fighting section of the Carlton
think to-day, he's sure to tell everybody to-morrow."
Quite patnetio to see Truthful James waiting to be dragged up for
his Caineing. "Don't know anybody of his experience and habits
more fully capable of putting on air of ingenuous simplicity," says
Habcoubt, eyeing him admiringly as he Bits with head bent, toying
with the paper on'whioh his answer was written. "But when he
looks mildest he's most dangerous. We '11 see his heels fly out in a
moment."
But we didn't. The Speakeb, doubtless touched by James's
helplessness and pretty childish ways, interposed, and on point of
order ruled question inadmissible.
Afterwards spent an agreeable evening in foreign parts under
guidance of Jacob Bright and Sir Joseph Pease. J. B. interested
on aeoount of the Congo River. "Must remain a territory," he
aays, "where Missionaries and Manchester men Con-go and oome as
they please, without interference from Portugal."
Curious mixing-up of long-oloth and Missionary labour both in
this and the even more Peasefull debate on Opium which followed.
Mr. Samuel Smith, in course of brief lecture, put the case for sup-
5ression of Opium Traffio with irresistible force. "Abolish Opium
'raffio," says he, "and you shall make ten thousand miles of railway
in China, besides giving a chance to Christianity." That fetched
the House; and the Government, instead of, as usual, meeting the
Motion with a direct negative, wriggled out by moving the Previous
Question.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Lyon Playfaib's foot is on his native
heath, and his style Professor. Question is, that Vivisection be
abolished. Lyon Playfaib says " No 1" and tells the House why
in most charming leoture. Members been yawning all afternoon,
and mooning round oorridors, library, and terrace; now flock in,
and listen with growing interest. Joseph Gillis sat Bpell-bound as
the Professor traced the links between Man and Animal, glancing
aside for a moment to express the hope that missing one may some
day be found.
"Man," said the Professor, "is only the King of Animals."
This disappointing, but might be worse.
"Let me tell the House how I killed two rabbits," continues the
Professor.
"Knocked them on the back of the neck, I suppose," the irre-
pressible Randolph murmurs. But the rest of House thrilled
with anticipatory horror. Seems that late Professor Simpson called
one morning on Playfaib in Edinburgh, and asked him for "some
liquor." Thought a Scotchman would instantly have produced a
bottle of whiskey, and one of those little wooden cups that grow in
the Highlands, and treated his friend handsomely. On the oontrary,
Playfaib took him to laboratory, and brought out some home-made
stuff. Professor, evidently mad with thirst, about to gulp it down.
"No," says Playfaib; "let's try it on a rabbit."
Gave a noggin to one rabbit; dies on the spot. Half a noggin
to another; lived two years a hopeless idiot. Professor Simpson
left the House hale and hearty.
"Ah I ah I " cries Wilfrid Lawson, triumphantly, "that oomes
of total abstention."
Not sure I've got the rabbit story quite right. Fancy it was some
1 other liquor made somebody ehe hopeless idiot. But there certainly

Playfair for the Session, one leoture a week. Find him with black-
board and chalk, and, if necessary, white cloth and magio lantern.
Business done.—Discussed Married Fellows and Vivisected Dogs.
Thursday.—Mr. Childers introduced Budget to-night. Very
good speech and very good Budget. Speech particularly artful.
Conservatives been preparing all week to come out to-morrow as
champions of Economy in National Expenditure. Beady to show,
with tears in eyes, how recklessly present Government Deen going
on. Meant to make it clear to tax-payer that, if he wanted to save
remnant of pocket-money, must get baok Conservatives with or
without a Leader. To-night, Childers, with most innocent ex-
pression, mentioned, d propos de's bottes, a few figures showing how
things stood during six yean of Conservative Administration, and
how in three years of Liberal. Conservatives shocked, Sir Stafford
Northcote quite pained. Lord George Hamilton furious. Sir
Richard Cross indignant.
"So rude of Childers," says Grand Cross, "going mentioning
these things in a Budget Speech. Especially just now, when we had
all got our speeches ready for to-morrow night. "Would never have
thought it of Childers."
Mr. Gladstone had very pleasant evening. Luxuriously listened
to Budget Statement, went off leisurely to dinner, returned at
eleven o'clock in evening dress, with a rose in Mb coat.
"Haw! Anything going on. Toby?" he said, slightly yawning.
"Oh, of course, Budget Night. I remember: Childers made
speech; riled other side. Must be awful bore, don't you know, to
have to make Budget Speech, and then to listen to other fellows;
getting no dinner. Haa very pleasant evening myself. Sorry for
Childers."
And the Gay Old Man, with a toothpick projecting from his
eloquent lips, strolled away.
Business done.—Budget introduced.
Friday— Great day this for Peter. Government have accepted
his Amendment on Reduction of Expenditure. P. positively pervades
the place. Linking arms with everyone. Two at a time preferred, as
that makes the corridors more impassable. Got hold of me just now.
"All very well for you fellows to laugh at me, Toby," he shouted
in my ear. "But 1 ve beaten the strongest Ministry of modern
times. Forced Gladstone to his knees. United both parties under
my banner. Nunc dimillis, Toby, nunc dimittis."
'Why, cert'nly," I said. Peter means well, but he's a little
boisterous for constant companionship.
Business done.—Decided to be more economical.
A BEOKEN REID.
[A possible Episode from the Lift of a Practical Philanthropist.)
The red-coated sportsmen were eager for the hunt. The hounds
could soarcely restrain their impatience, and the horses were restive
from inaction. It was a lovely morning—just the very day for a
grand run.
The Master, the Huntsman, and the Whipper-in were ready to
start, when the report of a gun was heard. Then there was a rust-
ling of branches, and Mr. Rbid, M.P., appeared. Mounting on a

"Ladies and Gentlemen," he said, "you know I am an Anti-
Vivisectionist. You know I object to cruelty to dogs and other
dumb animals."
"We know you are very feeble about your facts," replied the
Master, who found Mr. Rbid tedious, and was anxious to be off.
"But although I am an Anti-Vivisectionist," continued Mr.
Retd, M.P., quietly ignoring the interruption, "I have still a hearty
sympathy with sport."
Here some of the Members of the Hunt audibly suggested that,
although Mr. Reid's words were of an excitingly interesting cha-
racter, they might yet be kept for some future occasion.
"I see that you are growing impatient," continued the good man;
"and I am not surprised. Although no sportsman myself, I can
quite understand the keen pleasure—the intense satisfaction—of a
glorious burst over a ploughed field, or a leisurely Baunter through a
bullfinch."
"Yes, yes 1" said the Master, impatiently; "but the fox is await-
ing us. So we must say good-bye I"
You can surely stay a few minutes longer," continued Mr. Retd,
M.P. "The other evening;, in the House of Commons, I insisted
that vour one idea was to kill a noxious animal."
"Yes, yes!"
"That you did it as quickly as you oould. That the first who
came upon the creature had the right to despatch him."
"Certainly, certainly 1"
"And that being the case, as I was walking along the road I hap-
pened to come across Mr. Reynard, and"
The field were wild with excitement. "Which way did he go?"
"Where was he?"
"Knowing that you wished to kill him expeditiously, I did my
best to accommodate you. I was perfeotly successful. I closed my
eyes, pulled the trigger, and shot the fox as dead as a door-nail!"
There was a shout of anger, a cry of hate, and—a Murder!

exercised and taught by specialists such as musketry instructors."
Screw. Delightful task for the British Officer—" to teaeh the

Safecard. More work, but no more pay. Expenses of living
increasing too, and allowance stationary—for your Subaltern at

Screw. Unite right. Competition for Commissions continuing all
the same, and supply exceeding demand. Wages of military labour

THE BUMPTIOUS BOY.
Air—" The Truthful Boy."
Once there was a bumptious youth,
With poodle hair and fishy eye,
A boy who loved historic truth,
And never, never sold ally.
And everyone admired him so,
He was so rude, so void of ruth;
They cried, "The lad has dash and go 1"
They said, "He'll rise, this bumptious
youth!"
This bumptious boy, in boyish pride,
Observed the hunters in full flight,
And said, "Could I not better ride,
I'd hide my head in night-cap white!"
He sought a mount, a schoolboy's scrub
To most it seemed, and small at that.
He stood a-tiptoe on a tub,
And scrambled to his seat, and sat.
Said he, "They make a jolly fuss,
These huntsmen old; the pace looks hot;
But I and my Bucephalus
Will lead the field and lick the lot 1"
And when he trotted, smart and cool,
Off to the field, the people oried,
"The boy though bumptious is no fool,
He like enough knows how to ride."
But when in spite of warning shouts
Of "Hi! 'ware wheat!" straight on he
pounded,
Like any 'Arrt, serious doubts
About his horsemanship abounded.
The leading huntsman, wary, steady,
He challenged,—it was oheek, indeed.
Crying, " Get out, you ancient Neddy,

That skilful horseman, with a wink,
Said. "All right, youngster, take your

I know the Country, and I think,
If you don't mind, I '11 keep to mine."
And all the people laughed and said,
"Ill-mounted urchin, bumptious mite,

The less the public knows of the whereabouts
of the Police the better will they be able to
do their work. But when every one of their
movements is dogged by Reporters, and the
results made public by the Dailies which are
all struggling for the Earliest News or
"Latest Intelligence," the conspirators re-
ceive timely warning and the well-arranged
plans of the Police are frustrated. To the
Intelligence Departments of the Dublin,
London, and Birmingham Police the greatest
§raise is due. And—another thing—we are
elighted to hear that in Birmingham the
Deteotives who made the dynamite captures
were armed with revolvers. We trust it is
the same in London.
Cave Felem!
It has been lately pointed out that, under
existing statutes, offenders convicted of
damaging, or attempting to damage, persons
and property by the explosion of substances
such as dynamite, are liable, in certain cases,
not only to imprisonment or penal servitude,

ESMERALDA;
or, "Meet me at 'the Lane ' when the Clock strikes Eight."
Considering that Mr. Carl Rosa has only got Drury Lane for an
Opera Season of one month's duration—just sufficient time to let
people know that he is there—the performance of Esmeralda is
most creditable to
the management.
The mise-en-scene
is very good, the
grouping and the
"business"
evince careful
stage - manage
ment, and the
effects obtained
by the simultane
ous impulse of
arms and hands—
in the end of the
Second Act, where

stocracy go wild
—will remind
playgoers of the

pany, and those

Theatre in Paris,

of the striking action of the crowd in the Prologue to the Great
Ballet. The only sign of anything like hurry or incompleteness was
to be found in the costume of the "men in armour," belonging to
the brave corps commanded by Captain Phoebus, who, intended to
be armed cap-d-pied, were perfect as far as the ankles, where the
ordinary modern walking-boot was distinctly visible—and even this
might be set down to the indomitable energy and enthusiasm
of the chorus-men, who would rather be on the soene with seven-
teenth century armour on their backs and nineteenth century boots
on their feet, than sacrifice one of the grand effects of the Opera.
Mr. Goring Thomas's music is throughout graceful and.melodious,
but it lacks character, as, for example, in Esmeralda's first song,

"Goring Thomas."
which rather reminds us of a sea-nymph gliding through the calm
water, and singing to the accompaniment of her; harp, than of a
dancing Gipsy Girl with her tambourine and her performing goat. _
Madame Geobglna Burns is better suited to the part as a vocalist
than as an Actress. She is always on the scene, and, when not engaged
in being fondly, or insanely, hugged by her lover, or threatened by
some disagreeable person, she is at once set upon by anyone who can
get at her, hauled and lugged about the stage, and generally bullied
in the most cruel manner. Like Mr. W. 8. Gilbert's Policeman—
"When operatic duty's to be done, poor Esmeralda's life is not a
happy one 1" At the end of the Second Act, Mr. McGtrcDN—a
stalwart representative of the dashing Phoebus — takes the poor
Lady's head under his protection in suoh a manner that he appears
to have got her, as the pugilists say, "in Chancery," in whioh try-
ing position she is dragged hither and thither, singing all the time.
Finally he lugs her desperately, and still in Chancery, up the steps,
with such vigour that we wondered she had any breath left in her
body. Occasionally, when Mr. McGuckin gave her a second's rest,
we neard her voice making a plaintive appeal in a high key from
somewhere under Mr. McGuckin's arm; out directly he beeame
aware of there being any life left in her, he set to work to hug her
head more closely than ever to him, and in this helpless position he
rushed about with her, first to the left, then to the right, as though
he were on the platform of some puzzling junction, vainly endeavour-
ing to obtain information from anyone as to the whereabouts of his

train and the time of its starting. The heroine had about as hard a
time of it as any prima donna we ever saw.
The Reverend Claude Frollo (Mr. Ludwig), whose taste for theatri-
cals led him into the commission of some very unclerical acts, was
apparently suffering either from a cold, in which case we sincerely pity
him, or from a mistaken notion that, to convey the idea of concen-
trated passion, the singer should be as confidential as possible, and
so, though no doubt he was very good and sang perfectly, we were
unable to give any opinion on the subject, as to us he was almost
inaudible.
Mr. Leslie Crottt's Quasimodo is a very clever performance,
seeing what a difficult character it is,
and how completely the librettists have
washed all the colour out of it. Occa-
sionally Mr. CrottYj by the production
of his voice and his pronunciation of
certain words, vividly recalled Mr. Sant-
let. He has to sing the best and most
telling air in the whole Opera; and had
the situation been more favourable, the
audience would have enthusiastically
insisted on his taking their encore of "1,
cursed of gods and men." Why "gods"?
Quasimodo wasn't a heathen. The
librettists have damaged the story, and
the finish is ineffective. Fancy missing
the grand effect of Quasimodo chucking
Claude over the top of Notre Dame
tower! What a splendid Wagnerian sen-
sation this would have been, musically
illustrated by a chromatic scale descent, from the topmost note in
the treble down to the lowest note in the bass,—then one solemn
whack on the drum, and " the rest is silence."
Could Esmeralda have had one such song as
falls to the lot of any one of her operatic rela-
tives, Arline, Maritana, Carmen—could poor
JQuasimodo have had something as brusque and
fej catching as the "Piff-paff"of Marcel,—could
Phcebus have walked to the "flote," and come
out with something as stirring as the Toreador,

Features in the Opera, gong like the Queen's in The Huguenots, the
lasting popularity of Esmeralda would at qnoe
have been secured. But as it is, the publio has to make its acquaint-
ance, to get to know the Opera, and so to "learn to love" the some-
what Bizet-Wagnerish music, for which process, on account of Mr.
Rosa's very brief London season, the publio literally has not the time.
Colombo is the new Opera, of whioh, as at present advised, we can
only say that the music is by A. C. Mackenzie, and the libretto seems

TOILERS AND SPINNERS.
The Ministerial Member for Bir-
mingham pitches into Lord Salis-
bury as a member of a olass that
"toil not, neither do they spin."
This is not one of the many clever
things, Mr. Cnamiserlain, which you
are noted for saying. A leading
politician, of whichever party, being
also a Peer, whether in Opposition
or Office, must necessarily toil, more
or less, but can hardly spin,—unless
he " spins round " with a fair partner
in the giddy waltz. Or he may go
out on horseback for a spin on the
downs. Bat these are two instances
where " spinning " is a pleasure, not
a toil—or at least it ought to be so.
For ourselves—but no matter. The
only sort of lord who spins and toils
at the same time, toiling as he spins
is a Cotton Lord—and he doesn't
personally always toil or spin very
much. ^ ^_

SHOW SUNDAY; OB, QUITE A LITTLE OILYDAY.
(By Our Own Mr. Merry-go-Rounder commissioned to visit all the
Studios.*)
The President of the Republio of Painters told me confidentially!
while expressing, through the half-opened door, his regret at being
unable to admit me into his studio, that his principal Picture would
not be ready, or, if ready, only just in time, for the Academy.
"Then," I exclaimed, "you are keeping up your name, and you '11
be known this year as Sir Frederick Late'un." A shriek of
laughter, and a heavy fall in the passage as the door slammed-to,
proclaimed that my side-splitter had had its effect.
I ascertained in the neighbourhood that Mr. Pointer's " Queen
of Sheba," called " Bauqs is willing," will not be exhibited at the
Academy. "A disap-poynter," as the funny Author of Jocoseria
observed. At Mr. Aonew's Gallery [always Bag news At the
Aonews'] in Bond Street I was unable to get near Mr. Briton
Riviere's chef-d'oeuvre—(why " Briton " when he's a foreigner ?);
but as far as I could gather from the Policeman who was keeping
the crowd off, it is something about a farmyard from which all the
fowls have been taken, exoept one old rooster who is giving a final
"Cock-a-doodle-doo 1" before being carried off by the cook. So
much I made out from the title, which is " The Last of the Crew."
While taking some slight but necessary refreshment at the soda-
and-milk shop next to the Gallery, I was able to pick up a good deal
about the Pictures on view from the remarkably well-informed and
intelligent young milk-and-water oolourist who serves the customers.
From her I understood that Mr. B. Rtvtebe's other Picture—or one
of his other Pictures—illustrates a scene where the Leviathan of the

aware that Refreshment-places and Picture Galleries were open on Show

Turf (whoever he may be) and a few millionnaires are seated round
one of the roulette-tables at Monaco: it is called " Giants at Play."
I then inquired about Mr. MacWhirteb's works, and was told that
his great Picture was something about a young Lady at Birch's;
being treated to a turtle luncheon, I presume.
From here I went to Mr. Holl's. He has painted a couple of
subjects,—the Queen's subjects, and both very distinguished,—
which, if placed together, will, of course, be called "Peace"
and War "—the first being Mr. John Bright, and the second
H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge in full uniform. The same
talented Academioian has also done a first-rate portrait of "Oar Mr.
Tenniel," which, however, is going to the Grosvenor Gallery. As
the latter work was not completed, it was hidden from this visitor's
inquiring gaze by a curtain.
An est celare artem," I observed to the recently elected Acade-
mician, as I tried to raise a corner of the drapery and obtain a peep.
But Mr. Holl was Holltogether too quiok tor me, and being in a
hurry I left without seeing the Hidden Gem.
Mr. Bouqhton has chosen an historical parallel, and has found out
a resemblance between the Prime Minister of Holland and the same
official in France; he calls it " A Dutch Ferry." If this is a success,
he will follow it up with "A Russian Gladstone," "An Italian
Bismarck," "An American Salisbury," and so on. He has also the
fancy portrait of a modern playwright, called " The Piece-maker."
Mr. Ebelt Hal8well«'b was the last I inquired about on my
return visit to where the Pictures are kept in Bond Street, and a
very polite Gentleman, in a velvet skull-cap, told me that Mr.
E. H.'s subject is intended as an opposition to the well-known illus-
trated advertisement for Pears's soap, and is called plainly, " Old
Windsor." "So Hals-welle that ends well," I said to my kindly
informant, whioh rib-tickler was too much for him, and I left him
cramming- his skull-cap into his mouth to prevent an explosion,
which might have been mistaken for dynamite and caused a panio.

and so I was obliged to obtain information secondhand; that is, for
the moment. No doubt he will write to me and explain.
Pushing through the orowd in St. John's Wood, I met Mr. Masks
on his own doorstep. I knew him immediately from his having been
pointed out to me on the First of April, and it was impos-
sible for anyone who has once seen him not to recognise at a
glance that tall ascetic nervous figure, that thin, pale, thoughtful
face, those coal-black locks, finely chiselled aquiline nose (which a
Csesar might have envied), those dark heavy eyebrows, and sweet,
sad, melancholy smile. "You needn't come in," he whispered, in
his low, musical voice, "I will tell you that my best picture is
that of a Modern Masher, who is dressing for a ball, and at the last
moment is unable to find the link for one of his wrist-bands. Need
I say I call it 'The Missing Link'? Good-bye 1" And bowing
courteously he turned to speak to a couple of Bishops, with whom he
was soon engaged in some abstruse theological argument.
I just caught Mr. Millais as he was mounting one of his own
Pictures preparatory to going into the Park. "What is it my dear
young frieDd ?" asked the great Painter whose resemblance to the
late Earl Russell in height and general manner is remarkable.
"The names of your Pictures!" I shouted as he was just moving off.
"I '11 tell yon one of them," he returned blandly, "it illustrates a
scene in a Sculptor's studio. I call it ' The Ghost Chamber.'" And,
bowing to his saddle-bow and to me, he ambled gaily away.
I was fortunate in gaining admission to the exterior of Mr. Cal-
dekon's studio just as the shutters were being put up for the day,
bnt the boy on duty told me that the Picture would be a figure of a
fishmonger's lad carrying a fish in a small piece of the Daily Telegraph
newspaper. "It is called," said the honest youth, as he pocketed my
handsome largesse, while tears of gratitude stood in his eyes, "it is
called ' The Wrapt Sole.' And if you want to know anything fur-

an Ariel, I begged to know the name of her picture, as "I can't go

"Tired Out," she taid.
"I am," I returned. "And as to-day I oan't see more, look as olose

Artist's name, one of her thoroughbreds gave a start and in another
moment I was in the arms of the Crossing-sweeper with a little piece
of paper in my hand, on which was written, Tired Out, by Mrs.

you will near more if there is justioe left in the land), and went wearily
into dinner. The first thing they placed before me was a hors-d'oeuvre
(began to hate the name, I had heard so much of chef-d'oeuvre all
day) of sardines done in oil. "A perfect pioture," said my wife.
"Take 'em away !" I oried; "I oannot bear anything more in oil,
specially if it's a perfeot pioture." She explained that she thought
the dish would suit my palate. "Oh, don't I" I groaned. I felt I
had been all among the Oils all day—quite a little OUyday—and
had worked like a man on the huile.
_ Friends dropped in to discuss the Pictures. We sat up late that
night. And when they left me, at 3'30, after a protracted artistic argu-
ment, we were all, more or less, colour-blind. So ended the Show Day.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
i news;
'ARRY ON HIS CRITICS AND CHAMPIONS.
Drab Charlie,
I 'ad yours 0. K., and the noosepaper cutting inside,*
Appariently writ by a party as puts tip his dooks on my side,
"Wich thank 'im for nothink's my ameer. The ink-slinger's plainly a flat,
And as for defending me—Walker! I larfed, Charlie, all round my 'at.
Nice sort of old miwy he makes me. I'm "poor and ill-dressed," Charlie—me!
"When Rhino- cum-Klso's my motter! It's all blessed fiddlededee.
"A ill-used"—wot is it P—oh, " Citizen "—sounds like a steamer, I know-
As if I was old Sir John.Bennett, or Alderman " out in the snow."
He's a " don't-nail-his-ears-to-the-pump"-er, this party,dear boy, and no kid.
He says Hoscar Wilde doesn't like me! 11 Who'd care half-a-bull if he did f
But he 'a maybe a bit orf the rails, Mister Hoscar's no muggins, you bet,
And. we snide'uns are birds of a feather, and wide-oh at spotting the net.
I am not quite so out of it, Charlie, as wot this yere Jorkins may think;
I've seen Hoscar Wilde, yus, and Wibtler, ana tipped 'em the haffable wink;
And though I'm not nuts on their notions in culler and ooat-sleeves, and that,
He's a tidy bit out in his reok'ning who sets either down as a flat.
Lor', Charlie, they 're fair on the job! They are like me in one thing, old pal;
They do know their book, and no error. The World is arf fad and fal-lal;
I've mine, and you've yourn, and the caper is jest to play on 'em all round,
And if I'd long 'air and the skriggles, 'twould suit me right down to the ground.
Their lay would, I mean. As to Wistler, I went to his Show. Sech a spree!
Not the rioters—they didn't count muoh, but the piok o' the fun was to see
The Swells gawping round at his soratohes, like lunatics puzzled and flustered,
In a room like a big padded cell as they'd used for the Btowage of mustard.
I carn't say I like Hoscar'b hair, and a kink in the waist ain't my style,
I'm more ah lar militare, Charlie, close cropping and plenty of lie;
But if fluffing and flopping was fetching in suckles in wich I might spin,
Wy I'd flop with the best of 'em, Chablie, so long as it pulled in the tin.
As to young Oxford nobs and the Mashers, that's jest where this chap shows the
green,
Got the very wust eye for a likeness, my pippin, as ever I've seen.
He says lam" fond of a lark;" right he is, though it's jolly stale
And so are the Gaiety Johnnies, and ditto tho 'Varsity Bines.
You see larks are larks. They're the "relish" as life ain't worth living
without,
To any young fellow of sperrit who knows his meander about.
Wot hodds if it's chivvying swells with red ties, doing spoons at the "Qui,"
Or leading a rush along Fleet Street, as we did that last Lord Mare's Day?
It's only the jugginses grumbles at me and the Mashers, dear boy,
Young pidgins too funky to flutter, old roosters too stale to enjoy.
We smart 'una must put on the pace, that's a moral, and if in the run,
We bump or bowl over the stodgies, wy, that's more than arf of the fun.
You git yerselves up,—that's the fust thing,—it maybe in Kino's "Two-two's,"
Or " claws " and a acre of shirt-front, accordin', o' course, to yer " sorews."
Then go it! For 'Abrt or Johnny, the only safe rule or receipt
Is make fun for yerself and of others. That tottles it 'andy and neat.
Noise? Noosance? My eye and a bandbox! What nidditty-nodditty rot!
Row-de-dow is the mark of true dashers, all game 'uns who 're fly to wot's wot!
Can't Bay as to Mohocks and sech like, but Undergrads, Mashers, or me,
We all likes a turn at the bellows when properly out on the spree.
Wot's life P Wy, Love, Lotion, and Larks,—the three L's,—and the mark of
a man
Is to take 'em unwinking, like 'urdles. Yoihoicks! let them foller as can!
If we thought of girls' 'arts, our own 'eads, public taste, or the popular ear,
We might be gilded toffs or two-quidders, but Johnnies or 'Abkies P No fear!
Tin does it, my pippin, not taste. J carn't run to the Gaiety Stalls,
Cig'rettes.pefty soopen, and so on; but then I've the run of the 'Alls.
Penny plain, tuppence cullered, my boy. Let me land all the luck I can carry,
And the most undefeated of Johnnies shan't knock many stars out of 'Abb..
• Our young friend has evidently been reading an article in Life, in which he is com-
pared—to his advantage in some respects—with our modem "Mashers," JEsthetes, and
University "roaring boys."

ferred, and none under Baronesses in their own right
need apply.
WAN-ED, to join at once, a steady Viscount of
middle age (married preferred), to augment the
Champion Marionettes' Company as a figure-worker.
Must have a good voice and know his business. No

of the entertainment when not otherwise occupied.
ANTED, a few Dukes and a Marchioness to take
round the world an established, successful, and
high-class entertainment. Moneyless Members of the
House of Peers don't write.
MAKING A MOUNTAIN OF MONTE CARLO.
(To the Editor of Punch.)
Sir,—I write to you as I feel that yours is the proper
paper in which to ventilate my grievance—a terrible
one. The Bishop of Gibraltar has called attention to
the horrors of Monte Carlo, and warned doctors not to
send their patients to so health-destroying a spot. Of
oourse he is right, as gambling must be injurious to
people suffering from bronohitis.
But, Sir, I know of a place infinitely worse than Mo-
naco. In this plaoe tyrants, robbers—aye, and murderers,
too—can be found by the soore, not to say the hundred.
In this place the most abandoned of both sexes hold a
levie by day and by night—men as brutal as a First
Napoleon, as false as a James the Second, as cruel
as a Robespiebbe, are always there. Nay, more—men
and women whose names have been rendered infamous
in the pages of the Newgate Calendar, smile and smirk
again. And amongst this awful company move young
men, women, and children. I am told that the place in
which the levee is held is particularly popular amongst
the agricultural classes. During Cattle-Show week the
rooms are crowded from morning until night. At other
times the London public throng the salons, and seem
never weary of gazing, with open-mouthed wonder, at
the notorious characters assembled there to receive them
with a hearty weloome.
What makes the matter more disgraceful is the shame-
less faot that the gatherings take place in apartments
exactly situated over an innocent-looking bazaar 1 What
can be more prejudicial to the best interests of the young
and inexperienced P I can assure you I have shuddered
when I have passed the detested portals of this pesti-
lent Pandemonium.
I ask you, Sir, then, in the name of decency to do
your best to remove the scandal. Paint the place in its
true charaoter. Tell of the criminality of a vast propor-
tion of those who go there. Use your pageB to point out
the pitfalls in the way of those who run the risk of
keeping oertain company. It is impossible to touoh
pitch and to remain undented. In like manner, it is not
praotioable to go to Monte Carlo, or the spot I have
attempted to desoribe, without sinking—sinking—per-
ips never to rise again.
And protesting from the very bottom of my heart,
I remain yours most sincerely,
1st April, 1883. (Signed) A Noodle.
The Mare's Nest, Donkey Town.
P.S.—I have just been told by a friend that the aban-
doned creatures of whom I complain are made of wax.
Need I say that I cannot, do not, believe him P It is
?uite true I have never been inside the place of which
complain. But what of that f Ait matter of fact,
the Bishop of Gibraltar has never been to Monte Carlo.
And see what a great—what a very great—deal he can
write about that place!

Leader and the Swallows.
A ROUND OF AMUSEMENTS.
Ux Voyage dans la Lune, at Her Majesty's, adapted from the
French of Jules Yerne into the English Verne-acular by H. 8. Leigh.
A prettier effect than the Snow-Storm Ballet which concludes the
Voyage dam la Lune is not to be found at any other Theatre in
London. The scene between that excellent Fantomimist, Mile.
Theodora, he Gillert, and Mile. ^Enea, as the Flying Dove, is
charming in every way.
The Swallows are still the characteristic feature of the Snow Ballet
Scene. Though
one Swallow
doesn't make a
Summer, yet
these four Swal-
lows ought to go
far towards mak-
ing a Summer
Season profitable
to Mr. Leader.
Mile. Adelina
Bossi has a
coquettish, self-
abnegating, re-
tiring way of
refusing an
encore, which
encourages the
audience to insist
on her repeating
her dance. Miss Fanny Leslie is a valuable acquisition as Prince
Caprice. Mile. Annie Albu has vastly improved since she attempted
Princess Toto. But, let her beware of certain Americanisms in
aotion, which though supposed to denote ease and freedom, soon
degenerate into vulgarity. Miss Marie "Williams has little to do,
but that little is bo well and artistically done, that we began to
think that Queen Popette was
somehow or other, we couldn't
exaotly say how, the life and
soul of the piece. Offen-
bach's music is light, spark-
ling, and catchy; ana M.
Jacobi's ballet-music is still
just about the best dramatic
dance-music that can be com-
posed for this purpose. You
may shut your eyes, listen to
M. Jacobi's ballet-music, and
tell exactly what the steps
must be. The scenery might
be improved, and the next
piece should have an intelli-
gible and interesting plot,
some funny dialogue, and, at
all events, one thoroughly
good Low Comedian. All show
and no laugh can't pay in the
long run,—and, in fact, there
wouldn't be the ohance of a
long run for it to pay in. Of
course, after Mile. Albu, Miss
Miles. Gillert and JEnea —
of Winter,Height
of Spring.
Fanny Leslie, and Miss Marie Williams, the main success of A
Trip to the Moon must be the Trippers.
Vice Vend; or, a Lesson to Fathers. All who are acquainted
with Mr. Anstey's original and eccentric story must have felt
that its dramatisation was a difficulty, and its satisfactory repre-
sentation on the Stage almost an impossibility. Mr. Edward Boss,
who himself plays Dick Bultitude, has, however, triumphed over
all obstacles, and the piece, in three short
Acts, playing barely an hour and twenty
minutes, at Mr. Griffith's Matinee at the
Gaiety, was thoroughly successful, very
funny, and well played all round. Mr.
Edward Bosk thoroughly looked Dick
Bultitude the boy, though nis tendency to
overdo facial expression, and his one mono-
tonous action with his hands, considerably
impaired the merit of his performance.
Mr. C. H. Hawtrey, in the difficult part
of Mr. Bultitude, was amusing, and very Soft Rote; or, Vice Versi.
little fault could be found with his change
of manner when his son's mind has transferred itself to his body
through the agenoy of the Garuda Stone.
Anything better than Mr. W. F. Hawtrey as the Schoolmaster,
Dr. Grimstone, it is impossible to imagine. It was never once
tol. lxxxiv. e


overdone,—let us hope it never will be,—and the character, in make-
up and in acting, was true to the life. It belonged to genuine
Comedy. The boys, too. from the biggest to the smallest, played so
naturally, that they could have given any performance of the School
Scene in Parents and Guardians any number of lengths and. won
easily. Clegg (Mr. F. Wood), Tipping (Mr. F. Hamilton Bell),
and Chaumer (Mr. T. Cannam) were simply the boys they repre-
sented. We haven't the remotest idea what their ages may be individu-
ally, but they appeared to be Comedians of sixteen and downwards.
Miss Laura Linden made a decided hit in the part of Duloie, in
whose hands Mr. Bosk has cleverly placed
the dSnoument. We suppose Mr. Edgar
Bruce will produce it at the Imperial. If
he does so, we strongly advise Mr. Boss to
eliminate the comic Cabman, and sub-
stitute the Butler. Short as the piece is,
it will still bear cutting, and ought to be
reduced to exactly an hour. The Curtain
should never be down for more than a
minute.
The German Beeds have got a very
amusing piece in the Mountain Heiress.
Mr. Alfred Beed, as a Cockney Brigand,
and Mr. Corney Grain, as a Solicitor,
compelled to appear in a brigand's cos-
tume, are both very funny. Mr. Benson's
music is pretty, but nothing more. We
don't forgive Miss Holland for making
up plain, and giving herself suoh a sun-
burnt complexion that she would be set
down at once as Brown Holland. She
sings and acts as well as ever.
'Our Mess," Mr. Cornet Grain's new song, has this fault, that
there isn't enough of it, and it is so far- from exhausting its
subject, that it might be taken as Part the First of a series "to be

Cornet Grain, of " Our


Alf-Reed the Great (disguised as a
Mutton Fi-rate of the Sandwich Isles).
Brown Holland; or, The
Merry Dutchess.
continued in our next." The best thing in it is the imitation of the
military band, which goes with shouts of laughter.
There is a very pretty lever du ride.au now being played at the
Savoy, entitled A Private Wire. Music by Percy Reeve, and
libretto by Arnold Felix and Frank Desfrez. There is not a bad
"number" in the score, which is none the worse for preserving a
reminiscence of Arthur Sullivan in the Lullaby. The mise-en-
scene is most praiseworthy, such care being, we regret to say, seldom
bestowed on a lever du riaeau.
The music of lolanthe improves on acquaintance: "Don't go,"
and "O, Captain Shaw !" are delightful. Mr. George Grossmith is
very droll as the Chancellor: but plot and dialogue are not up
to the mark of Patience and Pinafore. The whole Company act
with the greatest possible care, ana the Chorus go through their
work like carefully wound-up pieces of mechanism, which is exactly
what they ought to do. All the Principals wear the electric spark in
their hair, and are clearly light-headed.
Mr. J. L: Toole is immensely funny in Artful Cards, and the
precision with which the change of the gambling-table into a couple
of semi-grand pianos is managed, is most creditable to the Stage-
Management. Miss Marie Linden is a most attractive Countess
Asterxski, and Mr. Ward a capital Sir Haircut Shortleigh.
We are bound to finish our round with an " Obituary Notice."

THE THEATRE OF THE FUTURE.
[Speaking at the Annual Festival of the Lyceum Theatre
Provident and Benevolent Fund, Mr. Irviso said that "the
extraordinarily large number of Amateurs coming upon the
Stage teemed to him to threaten to sweep away professional
Acton altogether."]
'Twill be a suooess, that is certain,
Reflecting the taste of the age,
A Viscount will poll up the Curtain,
And Dnkes will appear on the Stage.
No pretty plebeians before us
Shall snake their anricomous curls,
Bat here will the Ballet and. Chorus
Be colled from the daughters of Earls.
A Marquis, in trunk-hose and camlet,
Will surely attract quite a host;
A Baron shall figure as Hamlet,
An Earl will stalk in as the Ohott.
And who dare prediot that we sell not
Onr Stalls, where there is to be seen
A live Lord come on as Claude Melnotte,
A Duohess appear as Pauline.
Though haply the acting be " shady,"
As slang-loving critics may say,
Methinka that My Lord and My Lady
Should draw just as muoh as the Flay.
Though Art be not here, why what matters
Its absence, for snobs will not fret,
Since those who tear passion to tatters
Have all of their names in Debrett.
DOING THE GRAND!
E verythino's Grand nowadays—Grand Concerts, Grand
Hotels, Grand Old Men, and Grand New Committees.
These last have begun well, at least the G. C. on Trade
did, but there was a bit of a hitoh in the Grand Law
Committee. The room is stated to be "more riohly fur-
nished" than that of the Grand Committee on Trade.
This doesn't look well—at least the furniture looks well
enough, but it sounds as if the Grand Committees were
suddenly becoming too grand. A " G. C." is just like a
sedan-chair. Whether it goes along easily or not, depends,
even in a high wind, on the steadiness and perseverance
of the Chairmen. If they get through a Grand lot of
work, the G. 0. M. will be complimented on his G. C.'s,
and will receive the Louis-Quatorzian title of Grand Old
Mon-arque.

{From Our Own Correspondent.)
New York, Monday,
I HATH just had the privilege of a personal interview with
O'D-n-v-n K-S8A, on the subject of the Dynamite Conspiracy in
England. I found him in a luxuriously-furnished set of apartments
in the Broadway, which somewhat astonished me, as last time I saw
him he was in a grimy garret at the top of a third-class tenement in
one of the lowest parts of New York.
Offering me a particularly fine Havanna cigar, and ringing the
bell for a couple of bottles of champagne, he sank back in his luxu-
rious cushions, and requested to know what I wanted. Any infor-
mation, he obligingly added, which he had it in his power to afford,
he should take good care to keep to himself. I succeeded, however,
in restoring him to something like good-humour by reading aloud to
him from this morning's paper an account of Sir William Hab-
coubt's new Explosives Bill.
O'D-H-v-N R-ssA thinks it will do "the oause," as he called it,
"a power o' good, bedad." I should mention that all the time
he was speaking he kept toying with a large dynamite bomb which
lay on the table, and which, as he boasted, if loaded, would blow a
good part of Broadway to smithereens.
"However, it is not loaded," he smilingly remarked, and added
that he personally was rather timid about firearms and explosives
and such things.
His language with regard to "the craven Cabinet of London"
was far too strong to be respectable. He seemed annoyed at the
stupidity of Whitehead and the others in allowing themselves to be
caught so easily.
"They don't know the A. B. C. of the Dynamitist profession,"
he said; but added that they were intimately acquainted with its
L. S. D. Gulping down a huge jorum of champagne, and stroking
his moustache with heavily-jewelled fingers, he remarked that he
sincerely hoped that Mb Belt-sacrificing example would produce an
excellent impression among the starving peasantry of the West of
Ireland. The agitation, he remarked in a spirit of singular candour,
whioh is perhaps attributable to the champagne, keeps England in
panic and himself in plenty,—and what better arrangement oould
be desired?
As for the inhabitants of London, they deserve, according to
R-ssA, all that they get, for their treatment of Ireland. He did not
hesitate to say that the spirit of strict equity, and even the law of
mercy itself, demanded that those terrible tyrants, the women and
children who happened to live near Government Offices in London,
should be slain in thousands by explosions of nitro-glycerine. The
dreadful ruffians who might be passing by when one of his infernal
machines exploded also deserved no pity.
As for the American Government, they certainly would not sur-
render him to British justice. Did I think they wanted, he asked
me, the whole voting strength of the Irish thrown into the scale
against them P I replied that I did not know, but thought it highly
improbable. Winking his small eyes, and knitting his particularly
low forehead, he said be thought so too.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Hovsx of Commons, Monday 'Niqht, April 9.—Dynamite Bill
went through troth Houses to-night like streak of greased lightning.
Sir William Harcourt, in charge of it in the Commons, attempted
to create diversion of delay by "drawing" Irish Members. But
they not to be drawn, though Grandiose Old Man frowned upon
them, shook a warning forefinger in their 'direction, and sunk pis
voice to lowest tones of Tragedy when referring to the clause dealing
with the British subject "who goes to Franoe or America, and is
party in any way, directly or indireotly, by word or by speech, to
any of these transactions." Justin McCarthy wanted to know what
was the difference between "by word or by speech," but restrained
critical faculty.
Sir Richard Cross, in his sparrow-like fashion, showed^ disposi-
tion to chirrup and hop around the Fourth Clause with intent to
show how much better a superior kind of sparrow would have done
it. But Gentlemen behind him howled. Sir Richard aghast. "Was
it possible that loyal Members of Conservative Party were interrupt-
ing him with impatient cries? Couldn't believe it. Tried another
chirrup. Howls again. Sat down abruptly and aghast.
In the House of Lords the Marquis unexpectedly broke out.
Denounced the Bill as Party manoeuvre unworthy of Parliamentary
traditions.
"Good Heavens, my Lord! What do you mean P" Lord Cairns
asked, when the Marquis sat down highly refreshed.
"'Pon my honour, don't know," said, the Marquis. _ "Fancy I
mean nothing. Fact is, been hanging about here all night to pass
this Bill, having meanwhile to sit through speeohes by Lytton, Kdc-
bebley, and Northbrook. So depressed; felt I must have a fling;
though, to tell the truth, when I rose meant to oordially approve the
Bill, and say that it ought to have been brought in long ago."
Business done.—Explosives Bill went off like a shot.
Tuesday.—Lord Mayor of Dublin arrived at four o'olock, in
scarlet robes and chain of gold. Magnificent spectaole as he walked
up the floor of the House, and took his aooustomed seat below the
Gangway. Many a man in his position would have ordered Speaker
out of Chair, and seated himself therein, or perhaps shouldered
Sir William Harcoubt out of Premier's place. But Charles
Dawson is better bread. Great excitement in House. Members uncer-
tain whether they ought to rise, and remain standing, as his Lord-
ship strode to his place. Some for it, some against. Before discussion
was over, the Lord Mayor was seated, and had carelessly thrown
back the folds of his gown, so that the massive proportions of the
shapely limb might be seen from the Ladies' Gallery.
Splendid I" said Lord Dunraven, who witnessed the spectaole
from Peers' Gallery. "As compared with this, Solomon in all his
glory was a poor white."
Subsequently, Lord Mayor entertained Patriotic party at dinner,
over whioh he presided with mingled grace and dignity. "We 're
all proud, of him," said Mr. Shaw, with a glow of warmth on his
honest countenanoe. "Sim Tappertit was nothing to him."
Met Joseph Gillis coming from the banquet, evidently in high
spirits. Quite a oontrast from ordinary manner of late. Afraid
he'd been dazzled by the presence of the Lord Mayor. But it was
something else that had cheered his sensitive mind.
"D'ye think, now," says he, "Labbt will reely be sent to
gaol about this 'ere libel case r'
"You'd better go and ask him," I Baid. a little tartly. Can't
bear spiteful men, though they' re thick as leaves in Vallambrosa.
How different the kindly heart of Captain O'Shea beats at this crisis!
"Think," he says, Drushing away a tear, "of Edmund and
Henry in at the same time. Perhaps in adjoining cells. But the
companionship would be some comfort. Maybe they '11 sing to each
other, and correct each other's little inacouracies through a orevioe
in the wall. Edmund will probably rear a fragile plant, and Henry
will cherish in his bosom a lonely mouse."
Good-hearted fellow, O'Shea 1 Voice ohoked with emotion, as he
drew this picture of the Member for Northampton making closer
acquaintance with those " vertebrate animals," in whose interest he
proposes to move an Amendment on Cruelty to Animals Bill.
"Cheer up, O'Shea 1 If they're 'quodded'—which I'll lay a
trifle againsth-you '11 be able to go and see them. You know how to
open prison-doors." Treaty-maker slightly revived at this prospect
of future usefulness.
Business done.—Disoussed New Scheme, propounded by O'Connor
Power, for Re-settlement of Ireland. Government couldn't see it.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Smell of whiskey in House to-day. Looked
about forW. H. 0'8ullivan. Thought he might have a few
samples in his pocket. But he's not here. Very rarely is now.
Become, in short, a "silent spirit." Notioed perfume was wafted from
direction of Galleries. Found them packed with Gentlemen, who,
Lawson tells me, are of the public-house persuasion, come down to
hear debate on Sunday Closing Bill. Members chiefly arrived in
four-wheelers, carrying great bundles, petitions for and against the
Bill. Mr. Cowen being a man of impartial mind, presents two from
Newcastle, one for the Bill, one against. Sir Wm. McAstht/b still
smiles supreme. No one beat his roll of yesterday with over half a
million signatures. A whisper about this afternoon that a large
proportion are those of Aborigines from the East End, the Aquarium,
and other resorts of those interesting people.
Debate on Sunday Closing not reaohed, and Gentlemen in the
Gallery treated to discussion on County Government in Ireland. They
listened languidly, staring at Sir W. Lawson, pointing out to
each other Mr. Onslow, Mr. Warton, and Mr. Callan, and
secretly taking nips, which accounts for pervading odour.
Business done.—Debate on Sunday Closing Bill circumvented.
Thursday Night.—Great men ever subject to aspersion. Lord
Mayor Dawson no exception to rule. It is said, and Dy a country-
man, that Petition he presented the other night as an accessory to the
red gown and gold chain, and a preliminary to the dinner, was
carried by vote of a majority of Gentlemen "actually engaged in the
whiskey trade."
"And why not?" says W. H. O'SuixrvAN, who has oome back
to-day, with his whiskers another shade darker. ."If there's any
persons concerned to stop Sunday Closing, it's thim engaged in the
whiskey trade. No one better right to sign Petition."
Turns out that Mr. Blake, who is responsible for the statement, is
misinformed.
"Only Ten of the majority of Twenty-five of the Dublin Town
Counoil who signed the Petition," says Lord Mayor Dawson, draw-
ing himself up to full height, and. casting a withering glance on the
ordinarily blameless Blakb,—"only Ten were engaged in the
whiskey trade."
Mr. Blake orushed. House expected he would rise and apologise
to Corporation of Dublin and its Lord Mayor. Told me afterwards
he would have done so, only so overcome that he couldn't trust him-
self on his legs.
"They told me there were Thirteen," he said, "and it turns out
there were only Ten. I am astonished at their moderation."
Innocence and ingenuousness of Irish Members cruelly traded upon
by Attorney-General. Criminal Code Bill down for Second
Reading. Lawyers on both sides agree that it's an admirable
measure. Wanting, of oourse, a little trimming in Committee.
Been hard at work all afternoon in Grand Committee on Criminal
Appeal Bill, and so disinclined to talk. At a quarter-past eight,
Debate, after dribbling along for the [last hour, finally stopped.
Irish Members away holding secret meeting. Eight English
Members present all agreed for Second Reading. If Attorney-
General had got up, spoken for five minutes, and sat down. Bill
would, have passed. But Sir Henry James had devised deep scheme
to entrap Irish Members. (At least so O'Donnell tells meT) If he
spoke long enough, they would oome back, plunge into the debate,
would waste remainder of night, and then Cloture be brought into
play, Irish Members shut up, and Bill passed Second Reading.
Bound to say. seems to me Second Reading might as well have
been taken at half-past eight, and rest of sitting used to get on
with business. But Attorney-General's sure to know best.
Things fell out as he planned. Spread over half an hour what he
might have said in five minutes. Irish Members came back, took
up the debate, and kept it going till two in the morning. Cloture
threatened, Debate collapsed, and Bill triumphantly passed Second
Reading. Wonderful success! But business ways in the House of
Commons more than ever puzzling.
Business done.—Criminal Code Bill read a Second Time.
Friday.—Spent morning in discussing Transvaal. At Evening
Sitting, Mr. Monk came down, very nioely dressed, to move Resolu-
tion on the Marriage Laws. Full benoh of Ministers, and things
looking all right. But Monk had not taken Joseph Gillis into
account.
"We've had enough of Marriage Laws for one"year," said
Joey B., grimly.
So he lay in wait, and Counted the House Out long before Mr.
Monk, as representing the happy Bridegroom, reached the Altar.
"The Doom of the ' Invalides' is pronounced/' said Mrs. Rams-
botham's Nephew, reading an extract from the Parisian news in a
daily paper. "Of course it is, my dear," rejoined his Aunt. "Ever
since I oan remember Paris, the doom of the Invalides always was
most pronounced, specially when the sun shone on it, when it was
magnificent."

THE COMING EIBBON.
Prixc Beacium Tale/or the Year 1933.
Chapter XXX.
• *••••
The ceremony at the Church had gone off with the greatest (clat,
and now the notable event of the day, the wedding breakfast, was
more than half over.
There had not been a hitch. The cake was a masterpiece. The
viands were perfect. But the feature of the entertainment was
unquestionably the high-class character of the cheap non-alooholio
digestive beverages with which the splendid repast had been washed
down. There was but one opinion about them. They were unique.
So, at least, thought Sir Gorman Wosh, the Slopshire Baronet.
"Try another tumbler of that Hydrophosphorated Gingerine,"
whispered the pallid, swollen, and portly old toper to his neighbour.
"I drink nothing else at the oover-side. It won't hurt you.
There aren't a dozen apopleotio fits in a pailful," and as he spoke,
like a true_votary of Anti-Bacchus, he emptied a decanter ot the
apparently innocent fluid at a draught.
"He's drinking himself to death," whispered the spiteful Lady
Tippius, with a malicious little twinkle in her eye. "It's a wioked
age. What do you say, Marquis P"
She tapped a thin, wan, bloodless-looking Aristocrat, who had
acted as her escort to table, playfully on the shoulder with her fan.
He looked at her with cold, white, watery eyes, and feebly raised a
tankard of sparkling eulphuro-carbonetta to his lips. "If, in the old
days, wine and innocence went out together," he said, gallantly,
"we can at least boast that, in the new, we are not without water
and beauty."
It was a natty compliment; and. as suiting the action to the word,
with a limp but frigid bow to his fair interrogator, he drained quite
a gallon and a half of the highly-recommended nerve, brain, and
lung tonic with evident effort, a momentary blush suffused her fea-
tures. And she would have essayed some naive and appropriate
reply, but at this moment all eyes were turned in the direction of
Lord Frothlngham, the old friend of the family, who had at last,
after several unsuccessful efforts, been propped up on his legs to do
honour to the toast of the hour. There was a hush of expectation-
then silence. "I am asked by my dear friend, our honoured host."
he commenced in a thin, wheezing, washed-out squeak, that told
only too plainly of many a wild orgy with the water-butt, "to bid
you charge your flagons with a choice and speoial beverage that he
laid down himself, with a view to this great and happy occasion,
some five-and-twenty years ago."
There was an attempt at a cheer, but the effervescent* had already
gone round freely, and spirits were damped. It died out like the
eoho in a catacomb. Still, the red-plushed attendants were busy in
every direction with large white china jugs; and there was a buzz
of something like oonsternation as glasses were rapidly drained and
held out expectantly for that " new brand." The company guessed
the treat that was probably in store for them. One or two of the
more moderate and thoughtful made instinctively for the door. But
the majority, in a state of flaccid dilution, and unequal to any active
protest, merely kept their seats, and simpered sadly with the reserve
of well-bred dyspepsia. The noble speaker continued:—
"I will not," he went on, in a painfully whining treble, "refer
further to the event of the day. It is wiser to let it alone. Weak,
knock-kneed, blighted, broken as we all feel on occasions such as
these, we would yet avoid the scandal of unrestrained hysterics.
And after suoh cheer as we have had beneath this roof,—the less we
try to say the better. So, Gentlemen and Ladies, charge your
tumblers with the famous old family toast-and-water."
• •••••
There had been a terrible scene, and it had taken seven stalwart
footmen and the French chef to carry the kicking old Nobleman into
the open air, and deposit him on the pavement in the midst of the
sympathetic crowd. But the happy pair had driven off, and he was
better now. They had seated him in a corner of the drawing-room,
with a mustard-plaster on his head, and he began dimly to recall
the events of the morning. He was still whimpering, but a kindly
voice was addressing him earnestly now. The Reverend Branding
Smash, the respected Vicar of the aristocratic parish, had taken a
seat by his side.
"Give it up, my dear Lord Fbothlngham," he said, with a rich
round rubicund laugh that shook a statuette off the mantelpiece.
"Give it up. Look at me I I never touch a drop of water. I see
the destruction that is being wrought in this unhappy country by
that terrible, that pernicious, that deadly fluid, and I avoid it as a
subtle and poisonous snare. And the reverend Apostle continued
the usual course of vehement appeal with telling effect and illustra-
tion for quite three-quarters of an hour. The poor old Nobleman
blinked.
"Give up water P" he asked. "Then of what do you make your
tea?"
"Of gin," was the cheery reply.
"And it is not nasty?"
"Try it!" There was a converting and pleasant wink in the
earnest speaker's eye now.
"And do you mean to tell me you drink nothing but alcohol P"
"Nothing but alcohol."
"And you are ever in good spirits?"
"Ever! Listen 1" and the kindly devotee sang the weak,
trembling, but now hesitating disciple several comic songs, dancing
chorus and all, in rapid succession. The old Nobleman bent
forward.
"And the secret of your perseverance ?" he asked, earnestly.
There was a moment's pause, as the good Vicar unbuttoned his
overcoat.
"I am," he said, pointing proudly to the silken little emblem,
"a member of the Yellow Ribbon Army!"

PASSENGER-DUTIES.
At, or about Budget time, the Chancellor of the Exchequer is
generally "interviewed" on the subjeot of Passenger-Duties, and
this year he has taken off an impost whioh weighed upon third-class
travellers. There are many passenger-duties, however, that are not
wholly oonnected with finance, whioh it may do the public good to
be reminded of.
The first duty of a passenger is to have his money ready, and not
to expect change for a fifty-pound note when he takes a three-and-
sixpenny ticket one minute and a quarter before the train starts.
His next duty is not to insist upon having a compartment to him-
self when the carriages are besieged by passengers, and not to
threaten to write to his personal friend, the Chairman of the Com-
pany, or to his other friend, the Editor of the Times, when his
demand is not instantly complied with.
His next duty is, when he has entered a carriage, not to look the
door with a private key, not to plaster an "Engaged" placard upon
the window, or to pretend that he is an escaped lunatio in order to
keep the compartment.
When comfortably seated, it is his duty not to place his luggage on
nearly every available seat, not to carry game in an advanced state
of decomposition, Normandy cheese, loaded guns, or knives of
sinister aspect. He has a right to read, if he likes, but his duty is
not to read works of ostentatious immorality or equally ostentatious
piety. He may use a reading-lamp if neoessary, but it is his duty
not to let the candle gutter down while he is probably asleep, to the
infinite annoyance of his fellow passengers. He may take snuff, but
it is his duty not to sneeze with the roar of a lion five minutes before
feeding-time. He may smoke, if he gets the permission of his fellow
passengers, but it is his duty not to smoke rank tobacoo. He may
sup or lunch in the carriage, but it is his duty to draw the line at
garlio, onions, or fried fish. It is needless to say that he ought not
to pick his teeth with a corkscrew. If he feeds at a railway refresh-
ment-room, he ought to take anything the Directors or the Con-
tractors give him, and it is his duty to be thankful both before and
after the meal. Let him think of the hardships his grandfathers
endured as travellers, and not make rude jokes about "horsenail
soup," concrete pies, and meat supplied by Grissel and Peto.
Masheric Intelligence.
They have a Club now. It is called the "Masherium." All the
tables are made very .'high, so as they shall not cut their throats with
their collars more than is absolutely necessary. They all wear
pinafores at dinner to prevent their spoiling their shirts. At this
Club, Champagne is no longer called the " Boy." It is denominated
"Hasherade. Potatoes, mashed," ready at all hours.
A Correspondent sends us the following genuine extract from
the Wieebaden TagblaU of April 3rd :—
"A lady with give German or French lessons towards English Conversation,
from a very fine lady or from a fine Mr. Englishman."
Any of our readers visiting Wiesbaden might avail themselves of
the above offer.
Friends ob Foes P—The Bishops, as appears from the recent
records of Convocation, are beginning to incline to the opinion that
the Salvation Army is a hostile force. Very long time in finding
this out. Indeed, some of our Spiritual Peers—or, as we should
prefer to write it, were it true, Paire Spirituals—seem to think that
there is less of the Army than the Knavey about these Salvationists.

ITALIANO IN COVENT GARDEN.
The great novelty of the ensuing Italian Opera Season will be
the production of a real Italian Opera. It is called La Gioconda,
libretto by Abbigo Bono—no relation, we believe, to M. Abbiqo
Beano—and the muBic by Signor Amilcabe Ponchielli, whom
Signor Pdnchielli of Eighty-fivo, Fleeti Streetti, is delighted to
welcome to England as his long-lost cousin several times removed.
Madame Patti is to give us a treat in La Oazza Ladra; Madame
Alha.ni is to be the Senta of attraction in the Italianised Flying
Dutchman. The Land of Song must be hard-up for prime donne,
as, though the names, just for the look of the thing, are Italianised,
there isn't a genuine native of Italy among the lot. Is there
a notice over the Stage-door of the Italian Opera in London
headed, "No Italians need apply"? As to the tenors, Mr. Maas
joins them, and will sing in his usually Maasterly style. Will he
Italianise his name? If so, there's an operatio one ready to hand—
Signor Maasaniello.
The Covent Garden prospects are good, if not brilliant. Mr. Hall
is at his post, as usual, in the Box-office: open the front door of
Covent Garden Theatre, and you come at once to the Hall. Appear-
ing generally with a gardenia in his evening dress coat, this worthy
official is sometimes confounded with the Floral Hall. To do so is a
mistake. F. Hall is lower down: this is E. Hall, and—that 'a h - a 11,
at present, on this subject.
But what does this mean in the Prospectus ?—" Companies of
Artists, withj Aocompanyist and Conductor complete," may be had
"at prices varying from 80 to 200 guineas." How are they sent
Musical Boxes? What's a "Conductor
warranted to keep in any climate? It'sounds like Professor Some-
body's.advertisement of an entire evening's entertainment, ready to
be sent out at any minute, including Entire Box of Tricks. Dissolving
Views, and Conjuror complete! Mr. Gte might have added, "Samples
forwarded post-free to any part of the Kingdom on receipt of thirteen
stamps."
The energetio Entrepreneur already complains (through us) of the
applications of which the following, inclosed for publication, are, we
suppose, fair specimens:—
[To The Manager of the I. O. C, Limited.)
Deab Sir,
Seeing your advertisement, I beg to request that you will
forward a company of Artists toplay the Huguenots, with Aocompa-
nyist and Conductor complete. We '11 do it in our back drawing-room,
as a little surprise to my wife on her birthday. Eighty guineas being
your lowest figure, I don't mind going to eighty-two, if you '11 throw
in Sir Julius " complete." Song, but no supper. Yours truly,
Handel House (Late 32, Brown Street), ALBERT BASSOON.
Kensington, S. W. [Late Brompton, S.)
[To Mr. Gye, Covent Garden Opera House, London.)
Sib,—We are opening the new wing of St. Florida's Church, next
Thursday. Having seen your representation of The Cathedral Scene
in the Prophete, should like to know if we can arrange for an
"Entire Company" (according to the advertisement in your Pro-
spectus) with costumes complete, including the Bishops who, if I
remember rightly, are always on in this Soene, and the Choristers
who sing that charming Chorus while swinging the incense. Your
minimum, 1 see, is eighty guineas, "with Accompanyist and Con-
ductor complete ;" but, in a good cause, surely, Sir, you would make
some reduction, and we can dispense with the services of the Con-
ductor and the Accompanyist, as our own Organist (Complete) will
do all that's necessary on our full-toned American harmonium. I
think we can manage fifty pounds, but we are only a poor flock, and
cannot bear much shearing. Temper then the wind instruments to
us, and oblige Yours truly,
Cope Rectory. Chas. Yeubel.
Dear Slb,
I'm giving a little festivity Entertainment to a few
Johnnies, a bachelor party, and think it will be jolly to have one
of your Companies down for the night. Your advertisement says,
"Companies of Artists, with Accompanyist and Conduotor, complete,
from eighty to two hundred guineas." We should like a Comic Opera
—something light and funny, with lots of "go" in it, good Singers,
and Chorus. Chuok in a Ballet, "Complete," and I'll go ninety
quid. The Accompanyist and Conductor included, of course. Send
Beyignani. Yours, truly,
Beaness Lodge. Trrtrs A. Dbumm.
P.S.—On second thoughts,' I don't think we'll have the Chorus.
It will be after dinner, and we can do that part of the business
ourselveB.
2nd P.S.—I reopen this letter to say that, on
do without a lot of singing Artists. One good 'un
Comic cove, with a set of first-rate songs.
3rd. P.S.—Haven't time to re-write foregoing; but on carefully
thinking over what will most amuse the Chappies, I have come to the
conclusion that you'd better make the entire Company Ballet. Say
"Ballet complete." We can do without Bevignani, and prefer Bevy
of Gals. The Accompanyist may be incomplete; send anyone who
doesn't go in for liquor, and who is strong in the wrists (deaf chap
preferred), as we shall only want him to turn the handle of my
mechanical piano, which plays a hundred tunes, with all the latest
Burlesque novelties. Perhaps I'd better oome up, and ohooBe the
troupe myself, or you send photos. The hall of BeanesB Lodge is
plenty big enough for a first-rate Ballet. By the way, supper after-
wards. Come down yourself, and Gye-ne the party. Larks I
Complete!
THE GHOULISH RAILWAY.
There was a time when Railway Directors, for the purpose of
Railway extension, were content with the homes of the living; but
latterly they have coveted the resting-plaoes of the dead. The
Churchyard of old St. Pancras was the first annexation, and now the
Burial-ground of St. James's, in the Hampstead Road, is threatened.
No ground in London is probably more wanted as an "open space
for the recreation of the poor creatures who are chained by work to a
crowded neighbourhood, but as those who have had the purchase-
money for it once are willing to sell it again, with the bones of the
helpless tenants for whom it was bought, the chances are that the
Ghoulish Railway Company will get it. Is the money to be used for
the decoration of a fashionable Church in Piooadilly?

RATHER CRAFIY.
While taking our "re-
freshment" after "labour,"
we read the following:—
"His Royal Highness the Duke
of Connauobt yesterday after-
noon laid the foundation-atone of
St. Ann'i Church, at Bagshot,
with Masonic riles. . . . The
Bishop of Winchester officiated
during a portion of the service."
Odd this. Is St. Ann in
the Freemasonio Calendar?
We oan understand "Masonic
rites "at the foundation of a
Temple dedicated to Hikam of
Tyre, of which Hikam Masons
must be a little tired. The
Bishop of Winchester seems
to have struck. Perhaps it
occurred to his Lordship that
"Masonio rites" on suoh an
occasion were not quite in his
line, so he would " either letter
it or halve it" — and he
halved it. By the way, Past
Grand Master Punch has it on
record that the last ecclesi-
astical Grand Master in Eng-
land was Cardinal WoLSEY.
It is commonly said that it
is so useful for a tradesman
to be a member of the Craft;
but, we ask, what well-known
partner of an old-established
firm is decidedly not a Mason?
The immediate answer must
be " Fortnum."

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER,
We've bin a-jogging on wery oomfortably at the Manshuu House
for the last two or three munse. We ginrally has a K >yal Prinse or
a Dook or a oouple of Markisses every week. Nothink keeps 'em
away for long. If they ain't asked to dinner to eat and drink,
they outns to meetings to talk, and to reoommend other, and of
course commoner people to subsoribe their money, which is, I think,
werry kind on 'em. That's wot I calls a werry fair diwision of
labour. The swells does the talking and the snobs finds the money,
and both fallfi.Ua the nateral law of their waried existence. I alters
gits a peep at 'em if I oan possibly manage it. I likes to see the fond
and almost revverenshal look with whioh the middling orders gazes
upon a reel live Prinse, and how they hangs with perfeot rapshur on
every word as falls from hit Royal Lips.
We have had all our reglar Bank wets as usual, and they've all
been apperiently enjoyed as usual, but there was nothink speshal
about em to oall for remark, until last Wensday, and then I'm
enolined to think as our nobel Egipshun All saw suoh a sight as
must have gladdened and estonished its werry eyes if it had
happened to nave any. Fanoy the subblime idear of asking All the
Egipshun Offioers to oome to the Egipshun All and have some
dinner 1 And not only the Commanders and the Kernels and the
Captings, bnt even the werry lowest of the low. even the deputy
Surgeons wasn't left out in the oold, but had reel turtle and Cham-
pain just like the rest.
Almost the fust thing as struok me was the gratifying faot that the
members of the old Copperashun wasn't a-going for to let theirselves
be out out by their soarlet gests, so every one of 'em, as it seemed to
me, who could either borrow or higher a red ooat, put it on for this
speshal millitary occasion. I herd one on 'em who had got a red
coat on that was quite big enuff for two, explain that he came in
that wunderfool garment ooz the ticket of inwitation said Uneform.
The Lord Mare set the egsampel, and looked like a reel Majar-
General, nearly all the Court of Aldermen followed sute, and then
oame the Deputy Leftenant Common Counsilmen, and a werry
striking display they made, you may be sure, speshally two or three
remarkably stout Depatys who seemed to have been getting reddy
for an enlarged Copperashun. Then again, to match the two field
Marshalls as came with the other gests, we had our own City Field
Marshall, Major Campbell, looking as solgerly as the best on 'em,
and the Sheriff's Field Marshall, Fonttfex, looking the appiest of
the lot, beoause he had his own Field Marshalless with him looking
as bright as a sunbeam.
The trubbel I had to explane to the reel solgers all the unyforms
of the sham solgers was sumthink quite strawnery, and I am afraid
in sum oases I had to shoot the long bow. Of course I may be sum-
wot predjudished, but to my mind, of all the splendid unyforms in
that noble All, oommend me to those of the i Royal Waiters in
a tendance on the 2 Royal Princes, and in atendanoe on nobody else,
with their butiful soarlet coats, and their golden epperlets with their
real solid gold fringe, and their stately and horty demeanor I I had
quite a frendly ohat with one of them after the Baukwet, of course
paying him propper respect, and he told me, quite in confidence,
while he langwidly puffed his Siggaret, that not only his own Royal
employer—they never use the word Master—but also his Elustrus

PUNCE, OR THE LONDON CHA.RIVARL
THE WHITEY-BROWNING SOCIETY.
[Communicated—by our own very serious Joker.)
April 1, 1883.
Tee Animal Meeting of the above Society was held this month on
the aforesaid usual inaugural date, and was in every respeot a most
successful gathering.
After recapitulating the delightful waste of time, temper, and
intelligence that the Society, through its efforts to further involve
and confuse the obscurities of Mr. WmTEr-BROWNiNo's oapital con-
nundrums, had effeoted during the course of the past year, the
Chairman prooeeded forthwith to read the following list of subjects
seleoted by the Vice-Presidents for the present discussion:—
1. Whitey-Browning as a substitute for cheap Champagne.
2. His Narcotic Teaching.
3. Ready-made Clothing and its Psychological Disadvantages, as
gathered from the Philosophy of Whitey-Browning.
4. Sis Estimate of Concrete Clog-Dancing.
5. The Inductive value of his after-dinner Adjectives.
7. Whitey-Browning regarded as an Omnibus Conductor.
8. His subjective love of Marmalade,
9. The Secret of his Abstract Influence at Colney Hatch.
On the applause that followed the reading out of this capitally-
Belected list having somewhat subsided, the Chairman prooeeded.
He said: "He thought that the time had now come when, from a
sufficient acquaintance with the foggy—he might say—the inex-
plicable phraseology of their illustrious Master, they might them-
selves, in their own humble disoussion, freely indulge in an obscurity
that would render their remarks quite as unintelligible to themselves
as they had, he was proud to believe, hitherto proved to the outer
world. [Applause.) That manifestation encouraged him. It would
be his endeavour, in future, not only not to oultivate the art of
expressing himself in ordinary English, but he would go further,—
he would do his very best to get along without any grammar.
(Applause.) There was, as their great exemplar had well taught
them, a wonderful profundity of thought associated with a briok-
wall sentence; and the illustrious thinker, who was able to command
an army of interpreting disoiples, all of whom knew a good deal
better than he did himself what on earth he meant when defying
Lindlet Murray, became the unconsoious Author of a side-splitter
so rich, so racy, so rare, that they oould hardly hope to follow in his
killing footsteps. Still they would try.
The Chairman then proposed, as subject-matter in illustration of
their first thesis, "Whitey-Browning as a Substitute for oheap
Champagne," to read and examine what he described as one of the
illustrious master-singer's "stiffest little posers," and proceeded
to declaim the following, amid a hushed and respectful merriment:—
BROWNING IS WHAT?
Browning is what?
Riddle redundant,
Baldness abundant,
Sense—who can spot P
Flaying with wisdom, yet fiddle-de-dee,
Telesoope waiting an eye that can see;
What of the oow that lumped over the moon?
Dishes enspooning with naught to enspoon t
Come, then, unstrung strangulation, 0 fiddle,
Scrape through the baldness, shy at the riddle!
Guess it again
Over your grog,
And aught that was plain
Grows thiok, grows fog,
Grows fog!
The discussion of the above was then commenced, and led, as
usual, to the customary displays of irritability and ill-temper on
the part of the withered and worn-out disputants, the Deputy-
Secretary being specially aggressive in his attitude as to the exact
Sychologioal significance of the expression, "fiddle-de-dee."
atters, moreover, were brought somewhat to a crisis by the propo-
sition of a new member that the meeting should close its proceedings
appropriately with a game of blind marrs buff.
Upon the Chairman, who seemed to take to the task cheerfully,
Sutting the Resolution to the vote, though there was a good deal of
asty feeling manifested by a small minority, who insisted that
"they still had their heads tolerably dear," it was carried at onoe,
and the further discussion of the rest of the programme was
adjourned almost unanimously,'amidst cheers of evident relief.
After a little desultory and nagging conversation as to the advisa-
bility of entering into a contract with some respectable local butter-
man to purchase the surplus numbers of the Society's Papers by the
hundredweight, the proceedings terminated.
N.B.—Mr. Punch, being oonscious of the existence of a Sooiety
established by some very well meaning and worthy people, that
nevertheless appears to him to have oertain vagae, yet kindred
points of resemblance to the institution with an aooount of the
proceedings of which his seriously jocose correspondent has here
furnished him, wishes, while passing little judgment on either, to
do full justice to both. No one has a greater regard and. respeot for
a great name than Mr. Punch. But knowing that the injudicious
and exaggerating adulation of over assiduous disoiples will often
not only make genius itself look ridiculous, but sometimes even
flatter and delude it till it wander unconsciously from the pathway
of its own loftiest purpose, he publishes the above for what it is
worth—a hint to be taken, cum grano, no doubt, but still he thinks
—to be taken.
PROSECUTING—A SEARCH!
{Extract from the Note-Book of Mr. Punch's sharpest Detective.)
9 a.m.—Got my instructions. Thought the task a most difficult
one, but determined to suooeed. Laid in oompressed provisions, and
chartered a fire-engine, so as to get from place to place with the
greatest possible celerity. Started.
10 a.m.—Have been to all the Polioe Courts. Many interesting
cases. Brutal assaults, suocesBfol attempts at fraud, &c, &c. How-
ever, in spite of all my efforts, oould hear nothing of him. He didn't
seem to be known anywhere.
12 Noon.—Attended all the County Courts now sitting. Again
found lots of work whioh he might have undertaken. But no, they
hadn't even heard his name. Officials thought I was joking when I
asked for him. General impression was that he had never been
appointed.
2 p.m.—Been to all the Private Inquiry Offices. Plenty of matters
there ripe for his manipulation. Was informed that he never inter-
fered. Could get no question about him answered. Consensus of
opinion that he was a myth.
i p.m.—Have spent the last two hours in the Royal Courts of
Justice. Seemed for a moment to be upon the soent. His name had
been mentioned recently in a oase which had come before the Lord
Chief Justice. Apparently he had been "inquired after" (like
things in the City], but had not been found. Many trials were
going on in whioh he might reasonably have taken a part. But not
a vestige of him to be seen. Baffled everywhere. Think, after all,
he must be a " legal fiotion." However, will not give up. Shall
run him to earth if my life is long enough.
6 p.m.—Tried at all the Polioe Stations. Nearly got "run in"
myself in oonBequence. Inspectors on duty thought my inquiries
were " a lark." Assured them that 1 was in earnest. Inspectors
convinced, but told me that "information had not been received"
about him by them, nor by anyone else.
8 p.m.—Attended, by a Constable, visited all the Pawnbrokers'
Shops in shady neighbourhoods, and offices of receivers of stolen
foods generally. None of their proprietors had ever heard of him.
hey said, however, that if he had been appointed, they did not
object to him if he did nothing more in the future than he had done
in the past. Constable, in taking leave, advised me to give up my
searoh. Observed that he was evidently invisible. Rather dis-
heartened. But courage! oouragel oourage! Once more yoicks!—
hark away!—I will have him yet!
10 p.m.—Looked in at all the Vestry Meetings. Labour spent in
vain. Asked the Clergy of all denominations "if they had ever
come across him?" They answered, "No—they had plenty of
work for him, but, as a matter of faot, they had not seen him."
Galloped in my fire-engine to all the Gaols. Governors very oivil
and obliging. But one reply, "Did not know him." None of the
prisoners seemed to have any recollection of him. Utterly defeated!
Weary and sorrowful, returned home.
12 Midnight.—Hooray! Eureka 1 Have discovered him at last I
Took down an "Almanack for 1883," and spotted him at onoe!
Here he is, accompanied by an "Assistant (£1000)," a "Chief
Clerk (£380)," and costing, with the rest of his staff, £3821 (pre-
sumably) a year! Behold him, "Direotor of Publio Prosecutions—
Sir John Blosset Mauls, Q.C.—£2000." I have found him in
Whitaker, but out everywhere else 1
Blessings of the Budget.—Nobody much the worse for it
Some few rather the better. Sixpenny Telegrams, and (preparation
for repeal of Silver Plate Duty) slight boon to Silversmiths. Reduc-
tion of Passenger Duty for poor Railway Directors. Arrangement
towards redemption of National Debt, with some advantage perhaps
to posterity at large, and without much present injury to individuals.
Proportionate gun-licences for accommodation of occasional sports-
men. Remission to Income-tax payer of partial impost by three-
halfpence in the pound—for the present. Any longer—don't you

AKRIVING AT AMATEUMTY.
Me. Punch, having been informed on good authority that the
unfettered enthusiasts who hold that a special training is by no
means necessary to professional competency, and have, as a conse-
quence, latterly been taking the Stage, if not the Public by storm,
are so angry with Mr. Irving, that they are about to emigrate en
matte, for the purpose of founding a Colony where their own fresh
and airy ideas can nave free and fair play, desires to recommend the
following to their notice.
It is merely a chance page taken at random from a little useful
handbook {A Complete Letter-Writer) Mr. Punch is compiling,
that will, he thinks, be found invaluable to the neophyte in any such
Society as his young friends have in contemplation. There are, of
course, in Mr. Punch't collection, models provided for "Amateur"
Soldiers, Sailors, Doctors, R.A.'s, Lord Chancellors, and others, but
the one he has selected from a distinguished Ecclesiastic will serve
very well as a specimen of the rest.
Letter from an Amateur Archbishop to his Maternal Aunt, announcing
his Elevation, and asking Counsel and Advice,
Mr deab, At/htie, The Palace, April 1.
Knowing that only a week since it was finally settled that
I should go into the ironmongery business, I dare say it will to some
extent surprise you to hear that I am now an Archbishop, having
been consecrated, with great pomp, only yesterday afternoon.
I think I may venture to say that the ceremony went off fairly, and
considering that I am so fresh to the work, I am glad to tell you that
I really get on remarkably well. Beyond holding my pastoral staff
upside down, forgetting my apron, leaving out a collect or two,
putting on my lawn-sleeves inside out, and bestowing an apostolic
benediction on the Verger by mistake for the Sub-dean, there was,
believe me, nothing.to distinguish my discharge of my functions
from the bearing of a veritable St. Anselm. By the way, when
you next write, will you just tell me who St. Anselm was? Also
St. Dunstan? Is not one of them referred to in the Ingoldsby
Legends 1 Of course, it isn't very important, but still I think it
will be as well, now I'm an Archbishop, to be a little up in Church
History? Ana that reminds me of a small commission I have for
you. I want you to try and get me a good, nice, showy, second-
hand mitre. I am told there may be some technical difficulty raised
to my wearing it in the Cathedral itself. But this is clearly absurd.
To tell you the truth, my chief reason for entering the Episcopate at
all was a conviction that I should look uncommonly well in a mitre.
So, Auntie dear, do go to Nathan's, and see what you can do. Re-
member, an Archbishop's one. And I should think it so kind of you
if you could come round some day next week and have a little eccle-
siastical chat over a cup of tea. I feel I rather want it. The fact
is, I have a heavy confirmation on soon, and I should like to be sure
of my own Catechism first. You see I have taken to the Church at
such a regular rush, that I hardly know where I am. The salary is
first-rate, and I find the gaiters comfortable—still, I should like to
have something to say when I charge my Clergy. You can under-
stand that sort of feeling, can't you, Auntie dear? I shouldn't like
to have to back out of it now, and take to a crossing. So mind you
come early, and give a helping hand to your always affectionate
nephew and spiritual father, W. J. New Sabt/m.
It will be seen readily, from a glance at the above, how very useful
a carefully compiled little volume might prove; for it is to be pre-
sumed that other Amateurs, like the Amateur Actor, or Arch-
bishop, may sometimes find that they have overrated their powers.
But a sober word in conclusion. Mr. Punch takes off his
hat to Mr. Irving for the highly sensible rebuke he has had the
courage to administer to a very foolish, but, it is to be hoped, an
equally ephemeral fashion. Yet the cultivated Mentor and Manager
himself, makes one mistake. His calling, except in a certain
modified, sense, cannot be regarded as a " profession." A man who has
been called to the Bar,—and is acknowledged, ipso facto, as having
gone through all the drudgery of preparation—becomes, at once, a
Barrister. The same process holds good in Medicine, the Army and
Navy, and the Church. It is this prooess of preparation that distin-
guishes a " prof ession " properly so called. For an Amateur to rush
into a prominent position on the Stage is much the same thing as if
a mere Law Student were to force his way into Court in the outward
trappings of a Queen's Counsel, brief in hand, having literally taken
Silk, without anybody having offered it to him.
But in dismissing the matter, Mr. Punch would move an Amend-
ment on his friend Mr. Lrving's Motion. He would not scatter the
Amateurs like chaff. On the contrary, he would welcome as many
of them as felt the histrionic call to the stage-door. But he would let
them pass it only with this proviso—that they should go through a
regular apprenticeship. They should have only a word or two—or
perhaps a walk on—and off. But no pupil of three months' private
study should be permitted to appear in the leading role of any piece.
Professors of their Art like Mr. Rydeb ,or Mr. Neville should not
lend their names to such inartistio attempts, which can do neither
themselves nor their pupils any sort of good. The public is becoming
weary of these exhibitions of amateur incompetency, and of what
use is it to the neophyte to appear as Juliet or Julia, and then be
engaged, if at all, as a "walking lady " or third-rate chambermaid?
Mr. Punch fancies that his counsel, as given above, would solve
and settle the matter once for all, and speedily too. So there is
Mr. Punch's advice. And now let some enterprising Manager try it.
"SUPPLY."
Two_ hundred dozen of Pommery, the World informed us last
week, is ordered for the National Liberal Club at the Aquarium,
which, the Conservatives would naturally remark, sounds like rather
a fishy place for a banquet. It is sincerely hoped by all lovers of
Pommery, whether Liberal or Conservative, that this large order
will not exhaust the present stock. We should be deeply grieved if
Pommery ran dry,—though, in another sense, provided that it only
keeps on "running," it may run as " dry" as it likes. There will
be two thousand convives present, so that this gives one bottle and
one-fifth to each person. If the Waiters are all selected from the
Blue Ribbonmen, and if a fair proportion of the company is ted-
totally inclined, the liberal drinkers may get a couple of bottl's
a-piece. After dinner the Banquettists will feel in just the proper
humour to " inshpeck what'ver's to b' sheen at Quar'um."

Parliamentary Paradox.—A Standing Committee
formed of Sitting Members.
MORE WAX THAN HONEY.
As midnight struok in the Bazaar below, the figures at Madame
Tubsaud's began to move towards the great hall in which their
Anti-Moscow- Wax-works demonstration had been arranged to take
place. By universal consent the Russian Giant (holding General
Tom Thumb in the palm of his hand) was called upon to preside.
The Chairman said he felt the honour conferred upon him very
deeply. No doubt the distinction had been bestowed upon him from
a sentiment of generosity. ["Hear, Sear!" from General Tom
Thumb.) The grievance they complained of had been forced upon
them by Russians, and so they had selected a Russian to take the
Chair on this occasion—although it was personally difficult for him
to find a seat large and strong enough to support him. (A laugh
from General Tom Thumb.)
At this point considerable confusion was created by an excited
deputation from the Chamber of Horrors insisting on taking a part
in the proceedings. King Richard the Third objected to the
presenoe of these figures. He said that they must keep the meeting
select, and a line must be drawn somewhere. He would draw the
line before the Room of Comparative Physiognomy.
King John and the effigy of an Anonymous Policeman were under-
stood to be of the same opinion.
A member of the deputation (whose name was suppressed by uni-
versal consent) said that the opposition was absurd. As a matter of
fact, they were one of the chief attractions of the Exhibition—
(" No, no !" from the effigy of an Irish Home-Ruler)—and to exclude
them was an insult to the Public to whose amusement it was their
aim to minister. (Cheers.)
The Chairman suggested that the deputation should be allowed to
remain on the understanding that they took no part in the proceed-
ings, a proposition to -which the meeting ultimately consented to
agree. The speaker then continued. They all knew the purpose for
whioh they were gathered together. They were there to
against the establishment of the Wax Works of Madame Nauwald
of Moscow at the Westminster Aquarium. (Cheers.) They had no
objection to competition, as their collection was the best and largest
in the world. ("Hear, hear!" from General Tom Thumb.) But
they did object to the degradation of the Profession. [Loud cheers.)
It was said that Madame Nauwald's Collection of Odd Fishes
(Laughter.) He begged pardon, he should say effigies; but really,
when Wax Works got into an Aquarium, it was not easy to distin-
guish them from the sojourners in the tanks. (Renewed laughter.)
When he heard that the largest group was to consist of one hundred
and ten figures, representing the recent massacre of Jews at Balta
before a background formed by an enormous canvas presenting
a vivid panorama of the scene, he could not sufficiently express his
indignation. (Loud cheers.) It was ultra-sensational. (" Hear,
hear !" from the effigy of a Gentleman seated in a bath.)
Mr. Cobbett declared very forcibly that the new-comers would
have no chance against the present company. Those around him
had the honour of being men of wax, and, considering their would-be
rivals came from Russia, no doubt—he said it without meaning any
disrespect to the nationality of the great man—(a laugh from General
Tom Thumb)—who was acting as their Chairman—no doubt, he
repeated, the new-comers would be merely things of tallow. (Cheers
and laughter.)
Mr. Cobden said he liked to be practical, and, as a sign of their
disapproval of Madame Nauwald'b Show, would propose that " this
Meeting protests against the holding of the approaching Exhibition,
and, as a mark of their displeasure, declines to patronise it even as
visitors on the free list." This Resolution (which was seconded by
Sir Francis Burdett) was carried by acolamation.
When our Reporter left, the figures had resumed their normal
expressions and positions, and seemed to be giving unlimited
faction to a highly appreciative Public

couragement of genuine Dramatic Art, and the defrauding Dramatio
Authors of their fees.
The idea of an attempt to exempt Stage Plays from the usual
restrictions where the performance, by Amateurs, is for a Charity 1
Monstrous! "Why, the excuse of a Charity is a perfect boon to
theatrical Amateurs for airing their vanity, and precious little do
they give beyond their pricelessly valuable time.
If Amateurs and Professionals do not have to pay Authors' fees
for performance when playing for a Charity, then Charity would
be made to cover a multitude of sins, and Charitable performances,
in whioh the only Bufferers would be the Authors, would be given
daily all over the oountry. The Amateurs who play for a Charity
oannot get their costumes, their soenerv, their gaB, their theatre,
hall, or their musio gratis; why then should the Author, to whom
they probably do the grossest injustice by their ridiculous attempts
at acting his piece, be the only one unpaid? The Author, if the
case be a deserving one, can hand back his fees, or can pay them
into the Charity's account as a donation, but he must not t>e forced
to surrender his dues on every occasion when the Charitable Amateurs
choose to gratify their vanity at his expense.
The Dramatio Authors' Society has fought very haTd to enforce
the rights of its members, and has succeeded. All this labour would
be simply thrown away, and several A'.thors whoBe plays, written
long ago, now, bring them, or their heirs, a small annuity, would
themselves have had to appeal to a Charitable performance, should
this Bill, by any unhappy chance, have became an Act.
A propot of a charitable performance, a most deserving case is that
of Mr. Ld ward Royce, whose drollery has amused us so many times
at the Gaiety. Illness has suddenly deprived him of the means of
earning his livelihood by the exercise of nis profession, and, besides
a handsome subscription whioh has been already started, by his
brother professionals, a Benefit is to be given for him at the Gaiety
Theatre on the Fifteenth of May. Everyone will give their services,
the Authors will give their pieces, and Mr. Punch strongly recom-
mends this case to the charitable playgoing Public.
Mr. Pknninoton, the Gladstonian Shakspearian Actor, is to appear
next Friday at a Gaiety Matinee in the play of Ingomar. The
following week he should balance it by performing something called
Outgopa'. The pictorial wall advertisements could represent the old.
barometrical toy, with In-go-mar and Out-go-pa' for the wet
weather signal.
Seasonable Theory.—The original of all such really strong
expressions as have since been the cause of innumerable tears to th«

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

/J1K
Design for the Two Barracini
Extinguishers.
COLOMBA; OB, SOMETHING LIKE A LIBEETTO.
When this notice appears, energetic Mr. Carl Rosa and his
capital Opera troupe will have disappeared from London, to fulfil
their numerous and hitherto deservedly successful Provincial
engagements, which will in all probability occupy the remainder of
the year. So full of promise (and of performance} has been this
short, far too short, season at Drury Lane, so ready has the musical
and theatre-going public been to recognise the merits of the Operatic
Company, that, if a committee of distinguished and wealthy amateurs
of music, with the support of H.R.H. the Prince of Walks, were
now to take in hand the institution of a subsidised English Opera
House in London, under the thoroughly practical and experienced
direction of Mr. Carl Rosa, the present year would not come to an
end without seeing the commencement, and, we ;will venture to
assert, the satisfactory commencement, of such an undertaking.
The materials are ready to hand, and a scheme,—by the kind per-
mission of Mr. Geobqe Grove,—carefully matured and judioiously
developed, without fear, favour, or fanaticism, would serve all the
purposes for which the new Royal College of Musio has been set
on foot.
The latest novelty produced by the Carl Rosa troupe was Colombo,
an Opera in Four Acts, music by Mr. A. C. Mackenzie, and book
by Dr. Franz Hueffeb. The latter we will consider presently.
The undeniable success of this " Lyrical Drama" (as it is styled
in the published book) in Four
Acts must have been most grati-
fying to the Composer, who, not to
be beaten by Dr. Hueffer's won-
derful words,—and he has given
him some twisters.—has tri-
umphed over all difficulties of
language and plot, and has given
to the world a work of whioh
Wagner, in his best Flying
Dutchman time, might have been
justly proud.
The Overture is charming.
There is not a dull scene (music-
ally) in the whole Opera, of whioh,
as far as melody goes, the gem is
certainly the Oorsican Ballad"
in the Third Act, prettily sung by
Miss Perry as Chilina, to whom, though hers is comparatively a
small part, fall the two airs to whioh the Opera will owe its popula-
rity, and through which it will beoome widely known to the Conoert-
going and outside public
Dr. Hurffeb has written a modest preface to his libretto, in
which he fairly acknowledges his inability
to surpass the poetry of Alfred Bunk, or
to rival the dramatic force and knowledge
of stage-effect, possessed by the late Mr.
FrrzBALL. As to the first-named. Dr.
Franz Hiteffer has done himself an
injustice. In some instances he has beaten
Poet Bunn on his own lines; but, on the
other hand, he has still much to learn from
the works of E. Fitzball.
The "accompanied" speeches are a de-
cided improvement on the old Italian
recitative and the English spoken dialogue,
singers being rarely good as elooutionists.
When we saw Colombo, an apology had to
be made for Mr. Pope, who, although
suffering from absolute extinction of voice,
yet, with commendable pluck, came on
and played the part of Count de Nevert in
dumb show. Mr. Pope proved himself to be
an able pantomimist, accurately conveying
Dr. Hueffeb's meaning to his companions
on the Stage and to a sympathetic audi-
ence, by the simplest but most expressive
gestures. We missed his valuable assist-
ance in concerted pieces, but we fancy we
did not lose very much by not hearing him say, for instance,
"While I attend to the affairs of State,
And vainly try with diplomatic affability
To win the King some hearts; I grieve that your ability
Of public speech has left me to my fate,
Being, it seems, engrossed by some grave subject
Of philosophic import."
Which lines, spoken in a Gilbert-Sullivan eccentric Opera at the
Savoy, by Mr. Gbossmith, who would at onoe proceed, to tell us in a
song how he became an affable diplomatist, would have been received
with a shout of laughter, and welcomed as real genuine humour,

Count de No-I-Nevers-
did-you-evers?
But Dr. Hiteffer, who is, of course, a humorist in disguise, simply
means to convey that the Count't daughter and a Captain Orso
have been talking together, and not taking
him into their confidence; a slight that has
somewhat nettled him, though he restrains
his feelings of just annoyance, and expresses
himself with a "diplomatic Hueffer-bility."
, Chilina says,
"I '11 sing you the song, in spite of the law
And all the gendarmes of Corsica."
Dr. Hueffeb, it is rumoured, has been
already engaged to write the next Gaiety
Burlesque. Then:—
'' Where the shadiest seat of your choice is,
• * * • *

Master McOuckin as
Orso-and-so. Fools-
cap extinguisher pat-
tern.
Shall wo whisper with mingled voices."
Here is quite a Shakspearian couplet, with
a kind of Two Dromios' smack about it: —
"I will conduct you where no one will find us.
Lean on my arm; they will walk behind us."
Then there is a stage-direction—most of the stage-directions are
worth reading—" Extt rapidly, with a tmile on her lips." Where
on earth would the subtle numorist, Dr. Hueffer, have her smile?
On her nose? Orto, addressing Lydia " distantly," and yet calling
her " dearest lady." explains that for " your father's child" (which
is the Hibernian-Huefferian-puzzle-poetic-expressionfor "you") it
is "not seemly To meet in this wild place a friend of brigands,
Whose head is threatened by the law.' Here the secret-punster
hints that an attempt is on foot to get Orso's head into Chancery.
On one occasion Lydia exclaims, "passionately " :—
"Let not the fire I saw in your glance
Be kindled to flames of passion wild
By the idle words of a reckless child."
The "Reckless Child" in question being Madame Vallebia as
Colombo. Quite a suggestion for a
subject for a song by Mr. George
Gbossmith, with Madame Vallebia
on the title-page, "She was such a
Reckless Child."
Colombo is killed at the finish, and
very badly killed too. Her death is
ineffective, but the final hymn—the
hymn which is "all for her"—is
admirable, and we forgive Hueffer
and bless Mackenzie. But this murder
of Colombo—which sounds like pigeon-
shooting in Italy—is wanton cruelty on
the part of Dootor Fbanz Hueffer,
who ought to have done his best as a
Dootor to keep his patient alive. How-
ever—beg pardon—Hueffer, Colombo
will live by the aid of Dr. Mackenzie.
Colombo will not be relegated to the
Co-lumber room of forgotten music.
Who killed Colombo t I, said Franz
Hueffer. And why did. she die '<
This way, says Chilina:—
"This precious life fell a sacrifice
To her brother's safety. We could not withhold her.
Until she was struck
By a bullet, and lifeless sank on my shoulder."
Bravo, Poet Hueffer! And how did she die P Thus—
"Colombo. I die contented. Hy task is done!"
—Like Tom Moore's Peri—" Joy 1 joy! my task is done! "—
"My father is revenged, my brother free.
When you are happy, remember me!"
There's a reminiscence of Bonn about this couplet in the "remem-
ber me" which we regret, as suggesting a comparison prejudicial to
the fame of the Author of Colombo.
We quit the book with regret. There are so many Huefferian
gems to which we .should so much' like to draw public attention.
Here is a couplet:—
"Have I not watched, and wept, and waited by night and day
For the coming of thee who to me of all is the dearest?"
Isn't "the coming of thee" beautiful? Any ordinary bard would
have written " For your coming," and made up his metre in some
other commonplace manner. But not so our Humorous Hueffer.
And now farewell, Dr. Hueffer 1 and "if for Hueffer, fare thee
well 1" Success to Colombo! which we hear is to be done in Germany,
where, no doubt, the libretto will be intensely appreciated.

Colomba the CorsicanSister;
or, Hueffer's
Child."

MORE REMARKABLE STATEMENTS.
From Mr. Berty Phibber, of Somerset House, to hit Official Superior.
Sib,—My absence from work for five and a half days may, I fear,
have appeared to yon somewhat irregular, hut I feel sure that when
I explain the fearful, and indeed appalling, events through which I
have passed, you will asoribe my non-at-
tendance to its right cause. 1 have been
the viotim of Dynamite Conspirators! Like
Mr. [Gut, of the Telegraph. Department,
I have been waylaid by Fenian emis-
saries.
OnlSaturday afternoon last I was walking
down Picoadilly (on my way home to Brix-
ton) when I was accosted by a person who
seemed to be quite a Gentleman. He asked
me if I had recently heard any news from
my second cousin in Australia. This ap-
peared to me so remarkable a knowledge
of my private affairs, as I have no second
cousins at all, and therefore none iu Aus-
tralia, that I was induced to accompany the
gentlemanly stranger into a rather low public-house close to
Leicester Square. After treating me to one or two glasses of wine,
whioh 1 am convinoed were drugged, he expressed a desire to Bee
the view from the top of the house. He therefore led me up several
nights of stairs, then up a ladder, and into a dark garret, where I
was immediately gagged, rendered insensible with a chloroformed
handkerchief and several terrible blows on the head, and heavily
manacled and strapped to the floor. In this situation I was left for
four days and nights; and I can assure you that I felt the position
a really trying one.
On the evening of Wednesday my inhuman oaptors returned. I
assured them that you would be getting quite impatient at my pro-
longed absence. They merely laughed, but allowed me to sit up a
little. Then placing several dynamite bombs to my head, they
ordered me, on pain of instant death, to reveal the whereabouts of the
sentries, the thickness of the walls, the locality where the cash-box was
kept, and other details relative to Somerset Honse. I threw them off
the scent as much as possible, and I invented a secret passage leading
under the Embankment to Westminster, whioh I fancy they intend
to blow up when they find it. I ought to have said that the men
had most remarkably livid faces, half green and half orange in hue 1
The miscreants then bandaged my eyes, knocked me on the head,
and must have taken me in an insensible condition down to Brighton,
because, curiously enough, I found myself lying just outside the
Aquarium there, in the gutter, on Thursday night, with no money at
all in my pocket. My medical adviser says there can be no doubt at
all that I have been in some unusual situation, and advises me not to
return to duty for a few days longer.
From Mr. Augustus Flighty to Miss Jones, London.
My own Amanda,—Can you ever forgive me V You will, I know,
my love, when you near my romantic tale. It must, indeed, have
been an unexpected surprise to you to arrive at the church-door on
our wedding day, and for me not to appear sifter all I I hope your
dear father has not been put to much expense about the wedding
breakfast. Tell him that the tradesman oan send the bill in to me,
if they think it worth their while to do so.
The cause of my absence, my love, was, I need hardly say, simply
an overpowering necessity. Nothing else could have kept me from
the Hymeneal Altar. Shortly after that conversation with your
father, just before our marriage day, in whioh he told me that an
unfortunate speculation of his on the Stock Exchange would prevent
his settling anything whatever upon you, I was returning home,
buried in pleasing dreams of our future bliss, when no fewer than
fifteen determined-looking Fenians rushed upon me, each brandish-
ing five-hundredweight of nitro-glycerine in his right hand. A
terrifio explosion at once occurred, which aotually blew me into the
middle of next week, this, of course, rendering it impossible for me
to be present at the nuptial ceremony.
You will doubtless notice, my love, that I date this letter from
New York. How I came here I really have no recollection what-
ever, but I attribute it solely to the nitro-glycerine, which is some-
times very peculiar in its operation, and I shall, of course, return
as soon as possible. However, as the Fenians took my purse, I am
quite destitute, and should therefore be glad if your dear father
would send me £50 at once. Yours, with unalterable affection,
though in a rather shattered condition, Augustus.
From Master Bobby Larker, at Dr. Grimshaw's Academy, to his
Parents.
Deis Papa and Mamma,—On my way hack to school yesterday, I
met with a terrible adventure, whioh Dr. Grimshaw is cruel enough
to say is all a sham! All the fellows here say I must have been
hocussed, but Dr. Grimshaw says it is not a question of hocussing
but of hoaxing. I know you will believe me when I say that I feu
in with a lot of Fenians in the railway-carriage, who cleared me out
of all that money you so kindly gave me. Can I have some more,
dear Papa and Mamma? I think it is dreadful that boys cannot go
in carriages without being blown up. I have not been blown up,
except by Dr. Grimshaw; but I am sure I should have been, as well
as being robbed and half murdered, and I know that " No. 1" was
there, because the man looked just like him! I will not trouble
fou, dear Mamma and Papa, by describing how I was attacked, but
should be glad of some more money, and the Fenians, I was for-
getting to say, also took away that jolly hamper you gave me
"iy I have
with the tarts and things,
affectionate
May
another?
Your ever
Bobby.

NEW PICCADILLY WATERWORKS.
On Friday the 27th the new Galleries belonging to the Institute of
Painters in Water Colours, will be opened by the Prince and Princess
of Wales. The " New Departures," instituted by the Institute are
first that the Exhibition is thrown open to all water-colour painters
without exception; and secondly, that a School is started where
instruction in this particular branch of Art is given free.
Anybody with a taste for water-colours, and having a spare half-
hour may look in, en passant, and ask for instruction. It is not yet
decided whether brushes and paints will be found for the beginner,
or whether the applicant must come provided with his own materials.
The supply of water will be unlimited, and for those who are only
brandy-and-water or wine-and-water colourists, there will be, we
believe, an excellent buffet.
The music on the opening night will consist of appropriate selec-
tions from the works of Composers who have chosen such water-
colour subjects as " Lurline," The Naiads " " The Wateruntches,"
"The Ancient Mariner" and so forth. Fireworks being quite out
of character, the Entertainment will conclude with a splendid display
of Waterworks, the fountains of Trafalgar Square and the Crystal
Palace having been kindly offered for the occasion. Most of the
Pictures are said to be gems of the very first water. Nous verront,
and in the meantime Mr. Punch wishes every possible success to
the Institute in its new home in Piccadilly.
The Bancrof ters, who have no sympathy with the Skye-Crof ters,
and when they strike " strike ile," ask, " What can the public want
with a Dramatic School of Art, as long as they have got their School
at the Haymarket?" Quite so; and even after their School has
been shut up, we still don't see, and never shall, the necessity for a
School of Dramatic Art. A good all-round education as a basis, a
talent for acting, perseverance, and, as Sam Gerridge says, "strict
attention to business," will turn a promising Amateur into a per-
forming Professional.
The Invincibles can quote Scripture'to their purpose. Their single
selection is, " Love the Brotherhood." By this time their affection
must be a trifle impaired.

AT BOW STREET.
[Amo7ig the Dynamitists, April 19<A.)
I PAH) the Cabman his exact fare, and he drove off quite cheer-
fully. I knew that for once I had had the best of him, that the
locality and the looal colouring,—chiefly blue, with silver buttons
and stripes,—would be too much for him,
for it was Bow Street, and he had de-
posited me at the Polioe-Court_ door,
within view of the Police, within imme-
diate hearing of a Magistrate. On such
an occasion I boldly paid that Cabman his
exact fare, with such a sense of confidence
as I have never previously experienced.
jP fiStU-A^ffl? ^ee^nff was *° De °* brief dura-
i J&p. -S^'^W-^i^^/i tion. Once within the precincts of the
Court, though armed with a card to the
Chief Magistrate, I became suspicious
of everybody: but, strange to say, chiefly of myself. I presented my
oard to the Policeman at the door. Only one Policeman visible,
and yet there was a crowd of ragamuffins outside, and the Dyna-
mitists were within! I knew that extra precautions had been taken,
yet every moment I expected to hear an explosion. The Constable
did not eye me suspiciously, he did not ask me my name, age,
station, when last vaccinated, why I wanted to come in on that par-
ticular day, and so forth, but merely let me pass in, and told me to
go to the third room on the left. Just as if this were an ordinary
day, and as if no extra-ordinary scrutiny was requisite!
Then it occurred to me that everyone about, whether bustling or
apparently doing nothing in a listless way, in the passages, was a
Detective in disguise. 1 began to suspeot myself of treason, of com-
plicity in something or other, I didn't know what; 1 felt a dread
of myself, and somehow began to keep an eye on myself, and watch
my own movements closely. If anyone in plain clothes had suddenly
walked up and arrested me, I should not have been in the least
astonished, but should have said, "Certainly—I don't know what
it's about—but probably you're right—I admit I oughtn't to be
here—I acknowledge I have no business here, I dare say I am in
disguise—take me away, search me "—and if they had found nitro-
glycerine, done up as pills, in one pooket, and a revolver disguised
as an anti-stylograph pen in another, I simply should not have
been surprised. In such a place, it is exactly what I should have
expected. Outside, I should have protested; inside, it was quite a
different matter. The atmosphere of the place did it; it was my
first visit to the chief Police-Court. I was in a sort of dream, and
seemed to be Criminal, Magistrate, Counsel for Prosecution, Solicitor
for the Defence, and Prisoner at the Bar (guilty, of course) all in
one. If I had been left long alone in that passage, I should have
given myself up in sheer despair, and requested anybody to make
some sort of charge against me and have done with it.
Nervously I entered room Number Three, which at once suggested
to me that I was only separated by a couple of walls from "Number
One." Here I had expected to see the Gaoler of the Jack Sheppard
era, illustrated by George Cbotkshahx, with jangling keys at his
waist (for 1 had got the scene mixed up with Newgate of the past),
and several beetle-browed, lynx-eyed Inspectors in full uniform,
armed, standing with folded arms, watching every "new-comer.
To my intense surprise, there was no one there exoept a small boy
* very small boy in knickerbockers—who was apparently doing
sums on a slate. Was this a Detective's boy in disguise P Was he
a young Detective in training P Was he put there to engage the
unwary in conversation, and then run ont suddenly and denounce
him P I viewed him with distrust. If he had looked up from his
employment, or amusement, I was prepared to have given him a civil
nod by way of salutation, in a mean spirit (I admit it) of currying
favour with even the smallest representative of the Execntive. But,
like the "Good St. Anthony" in the old song, he "never took his
eyes off the old black book,"—I mean, in this instance, the slate.
Keeping my glance fixed sideways on the boy, I sat down and
began my game, too, of pretending to be interested in the adver-
tisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, which was lying on the table.
I had scarcely settled myself into the assumption of an easy attitude
when a pleasant-looking person (Usher, I believe) came in, took my
card, examined it carefully, then looked at me as though failing to
associate me with some description he had had of the individual to
whom the oard really belonged. (1 shouldn't have been in the least
angry, indeed I should have taken it as quite a matter of course, had
he handed the card back, shaken his head knowingly, and observed,
"It won't do—this has been tried on before here, you know—you
ain't the person you represent yourself to be "—and I should have
acquiesced, bowed politely, and ,'gone away, only to wake up when
once more in the open air, and alive to the fact of my own
identity. After remarking that the case would not begin for
another quarter-of-an-hour or so, he retired with my oard, returning
in a few minutes to inform me that he would show me into a seat
as soon as I liked to go in. In the meantime the calculating boy had
disappeared—a mysterious bell had sounded somewhere, and the
boy had vanished.
As I went down the passage I caught a glimpse of him laughing
and talking to a black-bearded Inspector, with an intelligence and a
free-and-easy manner far in advanoe of his years. I have no shadow
of doubt about it,—that boy is the future English Lscoca, and he is
here in training for the Detective Department. If I had been taken
up and charged there on any count, no matter what, the evidence of
that boy, I am convinced, would have been damning.
I was, as the papers say, "accommodated witn a seat on the
Bench." I was painfully wide awake to everything that went on,
but for all that I was in a dream. I seemed to recognise all the
prisoners: I seemed to be familiar with every face in Court, no
matter where he was, or who be might be, or what he was there for.
People annoyed me by sneezing and coughing at the most interest-
ing moments. A Police Court should be the quietest place possible,
so that the attention of all may not be distracted by any irrele-
vant issues." But to begin with, there are as many doors in the
Bow Street Court as there are in a bustling scene in a Criterion
Farce, where everybody hides all at once, and each person comes out
at the wrong moment. All the doors being perpetually opened and
shut—until even the patient Sir James Ingham could stand it no
longer, and had, at all events, one of them locked,—constituted of
themselves so many irrelevant and distracting issues. Then the
whispering 1 Heavens! it seemed as if everyone had come in here
for the express purpose of whispering to everybody else,—not neces-
sarily about the case, but about anything. The sneezing, too,
was most distressing, causing the Usher to rise up, and call out
"Silence 1" in his loudest voice, while looking daggers in the
direction of the sneezes, which seemed to come from somebody
in the crowd near the door in the furthest oorner. The sneezer
—a most irritating person, who broke out spasmodically at quite
irregular intervals—remained invisible; and, in spite of the pre-
sence in Court of a select body of Deteotives, the sneezer remained
undetected. The only man in the Court who had reduced
sneezing, coughing, and the use of the pocket-handkerchief to a
perfect art was the Usher, who, when afflicted
suddenly disappeared below the edge of his box, buried his lace in
his handkerchief, as if overcome by a burst of irrepressible emotion,
and, so, to speak, kept his spasm to himself without annoying any-
one, recovering so quiokly a* to be up again with the rapidity of a
spring-toy figure, fresh as ever, a trifle red in the faoe, perhaps,
after the struggle, but ready to attend to the Chief Clerk, and to
shout " Silence!" once more to the invisible sneezer, to whom he had
just been setting so excellent an example.
Of the Preliminary Examination itself, of the links in the chain of
evidence slowly and surely forged by Mr. Poland in his oool, unim-
passioned manner, of Sir Jakes Ingham, ready to listen to and to
answer courteously and wisely any objeotion, of the marvellous pre-
cision of the Clerk of the Court in taking down, and, more wonderful
still, subsequently deciphering his own handwriting when reading
over the evidence to a Witness, of the fainting of the Witness, of the
demeanour of the Prisoners,.of the faces of the Prisoners themselves
individually, of their Counsel, of all this I can only say that it was
a very vivid night-mareish dream from, which I awoke once, partially,
for luncheon, and to which I went back immediately afterwards, and
took up the dream where it had left off.
When it was all over for the day, and I was quite awake again, it
was with the greatest difficulty that I could tear myself away from
Bow Street. I tried to shake it off—I went for a walk—but, as in
Shelley's poem, there seemed to be "a spirit in my feet," which
insisted on taking me back again—no matter in what direction I had
started, or how far I had got on the road away from the place—to
Bow Street.
I walked about with assumed boldness, with a sort of vague feel-
ing that I was either a Criminal escaping from justice, or a Detective
in disguise. On the whole I think the latter sensation predominated.
In everyone I met I fancied I recognised either a Prisoner or a
Policeman. The lineaments of three of the Prisoners I couldn't get
out of my head. They seemed to be photographed on my eyes, and
were perpetually mixing themselves up with the features of friends
and acquaintances. Wherever I went I was a haunted man, and
saw Prisoners everywhere. They seemed to have got into the Club;
they lurked about the street; 1 came upon them unexpectedly round
corners. The Polioe appeared to regard me slily, as much as to
say, "All right, I know him: he's just come from Bow Street.
Pass, friend, and all's well."
With the hurry of dressing for dinner, and after the first glass
of Champagne—the dream had gone. But I can recall it all,—and
shan't in a hurry forget my first Dynamite Day at Bow Street Polio*
Court.

A yellow Primrose on the

Touched not the heart of

A river of Primroses is

WANTED A TEST ACT?
[Private Communication from Our Oxen School boy.)
Dear Mr. Punch,
I have read a letter from a Dr. Dudgeon, advising people
to taste—(oh 1 what a lark!)—Nitro-Glycerine. He calls this
"testing " for it. But here's a cutting from his letter :—
"If we put on our tongue not more than one-tenth of a drop, we observe,
after one minute, more or leas throbbing in the head, especially the templea,
aggravated to pain on shaking the head, a feeling of constriction in the neck,
an though a band were tied tightly round it, and a quickened action oi the
heart, the pulse rising to 100 and even 120 per minute."
You see this is evidently meant for a bit of fun, but not much
comes of it, does it? Pulse at 120, with a band round your neck?
Why, a tablespoonful of common Cayenne pepper put in the soup at
a dinner-party, will do as much as that for a dozen_ people. You
try it. But as to having a game with Nitro-Glycerine, I've been
thinking out a dodge or two after reading the papers. Look here,
now: if you want some real good "tests, and no mistake, here you
are. Here's three to start with:—
1. Make a quart of the regular stuff, from a 'good receipt, then
when you've let it stand long enough, give the baby a tea-spoonful.
If the first time he falls down he blows up—then it s all right.
2. Take a tumbler full and do it up with fuller's earth and black -
in g till you've made a bit of dynamite of it. Now look out for a house
in a fashionable square (an uncle's does best) having in coals. Then
pitch your lump into a sack and watch. If in about five minutes
the pavement is shot clean into the drawing-room windows and the
root comes off—then you know it's all right.
3. Take all you've got left of the stuff loose in a carpet bag, and
get into an omnibus where the road is in bad. condition. Bet all the
people they '11 get out without paying their fares. Now wait for a
jerk—and they 11 do it. If there is nothing left of the omnibus but
you and the conductor's badge—well, then, you know it's all right.
I could give you some more, Mr. Punch, but I dare say this will
do for you to start with. Suppose you just try them. Anyhow,
there's more fun to be got out of them than out of that stale old
plant of taking your breath away. No, Dr. Dudgeon may think it
prime, but I can tell him it isn't a patch on the conclusive settlers
of yours scientifically, Tomht.
'Ware Heroes I
0h! no, we never pension them,
Our warriors and our tars;
Our game's to use and then contemn
The men who fight our wars.
Oh, would-be heroes pause on

OF PARLIAMENT.
.OTBD PBOM
THE DIAEY OF TOBY, M.P.
Houss of Commons, Monday, April 16, Midnight.—W. E.G.
still here, though it's time he was home in bed. In high spirits,
too, at progress of business. Criminal Code Bill referred to Grand
Committee; Patents Bill read a Second Time, and will be referred
to Grand Committee before Speaker leaves the Chair.
"Epur si muove. Tour," he said, playfully pulling my ear.
"Yes, my gay old Galileo (if you will allow me to call you so),
it does. But at pretty cost to us. I have been on Grand Com-
mittee on Criminal Appeal Bill to-day. Met at noon; ground away
at work till quarter to four; had a couple of meat biscuits and
saucer of milk, then into House to be at prayers, and secure seat.
Sinoe then helped to pass two big Bills. Now it's midnight, and
daresay it '11 be two in the morning before I get home. That's
fourteen hours' work, which is pretty well to bo going on with.
Tell you what,—1 shall bring in a Ten Hours' Bill for applica-
tion to House of Commons, will get Inspectors appointed, as in
other factories, and have work put on proper footing. It's all
very well to go on at this rate for a bit. But look at cost. You
lose some of your best men. Bobby Spencer already laid up, with
merely hearing how hard Cavendish Bentinck works. Constitu-
tion, it is true, a little weakened by intense mental strain in
connection with visit to Ireland. But others will, go, and average
of bye- Elections will be quadrupled."
"Nonsense, Toby, nonsense. You young dogs are a degenerate
race. I worked fourteen hours a day for fifty years, and look
at me!"
Hadn't prolonged opportunity. Off like an antelope down the
Corridor, in behind the Speakers Chair, and so back to his seat.
Terribly afraid he'd lost something during brief absence. Wonder-
ful Old Man! But he's killing us all the same.
Business done.—Criminal Code fBill referred to Grand Com-
mittee. Patents Bill read a Second Time, and sent on to Grand
Committee. Grand Committees working capitally.
Wednesday, 2 a.m.— Pell just brought Lord Henry Lennox up
on charge of voting in wrong Lobby. Noble Lord blushes and
simpers, as if he were being led to the altar.
"How's this, young man?" says Speakeb, sternly.
"Please, Sir, Bimpered Lord Henry, "I fell asleep, and didn't
hear you put the question. Wynn told me to be sure to be down
and vote. Saw a lot of Members going into Lobby. Went with
them. Horrified to find myself in such company. Tried to get out.
Doors locked, so had to go and .vote against Pell's Motion. But
didn't do it on purpose."
Evidently mistake, so let Lord Henry off. Don't wonder he
fell asleep. Wonder is that anybody's awake, though just before

[April 28, 1883.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Division had a good rousing shout at M'Kenna. Sir Joseph, who is
sure he'd make a good Chancellor of the Exchequer, been popping up
sinoe ten o'olock last night, when he came in from dinner. But
Front Bench men had then taken up the running, and no chance
for men below the Gangway. But the blood of the M'Kenna's up,
as anyone might see by looking at Sir Joseph's face.
"Go on! go on I" he murmured, when, rising for the third time,
the Speaker gave the preference to Mr. Goschen; "you may
delay me, but you Kenna stop me."
So, when Gladstone sat down a little before two o'olock this
morning, Sir Job rose onoe more. 8o did ories from the House.
Suoh howling, roaring, and hooting not been heard for many days.
Quite refreshing and inspiriting after level flow of night's debate.
It was then Lord Henry Lennox was disturbed in his sleep.
Dreaming he was at last First Lord of the Admiralty in strong
Conservative Government, and thought .this was shout of the Dock-
yard men, whose wages he had been reducing.
"Must do it!" Lord Henry murmurs, "Must do it! Awfully
fine fellows Conservative working-men, and that sort of thing. But
Radicals looking closer than ever after demnition coppers. Must
save them! And Lord Henry, turning over, went to sleep again.
Sir Joseph continued his speech for ten minutes. Deeply in-
teresting. Full of facts, crammed with figures, pellucid in style,
convincing in argument, charming in eloquence; only not a single
syllable audible above the uproar. Sir Joseph's peroration delivered
with fine effect, he sat down. House cleared for a Division, and
Lord Henry Lennox rubbing his eyes, and pleased with hazy recol-
leotion of having "been firm with the Dockyard men," went out to
vote against his own party.
Business done.—Mr. Pell's Resolution in favour of Immediate
Settlement of Local Taxation Question defeated by 229 Liberals and
Lord Henry Lennox, 216 voting for Motion.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Business of this House not well regu-
lated. After recent prolonged sittings, with the Division on Local
Taxation taken at two o'clock this morning, the conflict with Irish
Obstruction, and Affirmation Bill coming on, it is oruel to impose on
what should be the peaoe of Wednesday afternoon the breathless
excitement of debate on Scotch Paroohial Boards. Even the hardened
constitution of Joseph Girxis could not stand it. At four o'clock
tried to Count Out House, and nearly did it.
"Why did you interfere, Mr. Bigoar ?" the Lord Advocate asked,
with blandest manner. "Doesn't the Bill meet your views P"
"I don't know what's in the Bill," Joseph answered with his fine
simplicity. '' But if there 'a one thing I hate more than an English-
man, it's a Scotchman; and when I found you enjoying yourselves,
making speeches as long and as dry as half a mile of oatcake, I
thought I'd stop you. That's all."
Am afraid Joseph's naturally genial temper has been soured of
late.
Lyon Playfair hovering round the debate as became Scotch
Member, but took no part in it.
"I like something that leads to samples, Toby," he said, "or
lends itself to diagrams on a blaok board. Then I'm your man. But
you oan't produce a portion of a Parochial Board in a pot like
Oleomargarine, nor dissect a Poor Law pauper as if he were a rabbit.
So I left it to them."
Playfair tells me that now he's K.C.B. he's more than ever glad
to be out of the Chair of Committees. "Those Irish Members, he
says, "would of course have oalled me ' Sir Loyn,' and from that
to 'Sirloin ' is a very short step."
Business done.—Two hundred and ten Gentlemen voted on Sootch
Parochial Boards Bill. Estimated that the odd ten (average of
attendance during afternoon) know what it was about. Everybody,
including the Division-bell, brought to ultimate state of exhaustion
by five hours' Scotch speeches. Bell, when called upon to announce
Division, feebly tinkled out a single call, instead of four as usual,
Speaker led into open air; Sir Erskine May leaning feebly on
shoulder of Mr. Milmaw, got as far as oorridor, and there fairly
broke down. Sootch Members quite cheery.
"A braw afternoon," says Mr. Ramsay. "Pity theyoouldna'
suspend Standin' Orders, an let's mak' a nicht o't I"
Thursday Night.—Questions to-night whether Out Only General
and Our Single Admiral shall be made hereditary. Mr. Labouchekb
puts the ease with great clearness. Lord Alcestbb, he says, has, let
us admit it, deserved well of his country. Make him a Peer, and
give him a pension. But, whatever may be the merits of the father,
the son certainly has not done anything. Then why give him a
pension? That is the point. But House having eight hours to talk
in, wandered over many subjects, including Sir Frederick Roberts
and Battle of Trafalgar.
Late at night. Lord Eustace Cectl presented himself, and, holding
on to box with his elbows, delivered a speeoh. Profoundest distress
of noble Lord lest he should say anything to hurt anybody's feelings.
What he did say was, that Gladstone had behaved meanly to Sir
F. Roberts. That, grateful to Wolseley and Seymour for having
saved his policy in Egypt, had overpaid them at the expense of
country. Didn't say this out in so many words, but, with hints,
innuendoes, and statements of what he'd heard or what other people
believed, managed to make it dear.
"Did you ever," said Lyon Playfair to Mr. Forster, " make
vinegar out of the plant?"
"No!" growled the Right Hon. Gentleman, who was just going
to sleep.
"Most interesting," the Professor airily proceeded. "Must show
you some day. You put plant in jar, pour water over it, seal it up,
and there you are. Excellent vinegar. If you take the same plant
afterwards, do it over again, you get some acidulated wash. Cecil
reminds me of this experiment. The style of his brother, the
Marquis, is the real vinegar, and his resembles it just as second
brewing from plant resembles original liquor. Must get you a plant
and illustrate my meaning. Sorry haven t one in my pocket at the
moment."
Business done.—Passed Second Reading of Pension Bills.
Friday Night.—In House of Lords, Lord Carnarvon asks can
Colonial Secretary tell anything about annexation of New Guinea by
Queensland '( Certainly, Lord Derby would tell everything. Quito

sionately pleading for acquisition, and Lord Derby coldly point'

A FOOTMAN'S GRIEVANCE.
The Times of Wensday contained a appeal from a West End
Footman which I thinks is one of the most affecting things as ever
I read. It seems scarcely possabel but it no dout is the faot, that
Gentlemen as fills the werry highest posi-
tions in West End Families as Footmen,
and even Butlers, has to go with their
employers to dinners to wait at Table
without no perquisets, just to save the
shabby hosts and hostesses the werry
trifling expense of perfeshnal waiters.
As he so pathetercally says, after being
confined in-doors so many hours a-doing
of nothink, he natrally wants a little
fresh air and a little reokreation, insted
of which he aoshally has to wait at table
peraps for ours I Poor Feller I better be
a mere Ewer of wood like pore Mr. Glad-
stun or a drawer of water like Mr.
Hookey, R. A. And how unjust to me
and my perf eshun! Why should Nobble-
men and Nobblewomen take the bred
out of our mouths by making unfare use
of their own 1 gentlemen f Many and
many a time have I olishyated at swell dinners at the West End.
They all nose where to send to when they wants anythink A wun or
Fust Class, whether for a dinner or for a Waiter, and that's in the
City.
My engagements at the West End has fallen off very much of late,
which I naterally set down to poverty, little thinking it was meer
meanness, however, as the pore Footman werry wisely says, now as
the Times—of which he pollytickelly says he is a grate admirer—has
bin kind enuff to put his letter in, his shabby employers will be
shamed out of their meanness. The one thing in which he makes
a fearful mistake is in speaking of the duties of a Waiter 86 most
unpleasant and even mean. How so highly respectable a member of
one highly honnorable perfeshun oan oondesend to speak so disre-
speotably of another equally honorable perfeshun, does estonish me,
and I can only account for it by thinking that the recellecshun of his
own serious trubbles made him for once somewhat unjust to those
whose important duties he is so improperly called upon to f ullfill.

Free Trade for Farmers.
"Are you considering any Measure for permitting the Agricul-
turists of the United Kingdom to grow tobacoo for sale?" No
impertinent question this, whioh Lord John Manners the other
evening asked the Government. On every principle of Free Trade
whioh the farmers suffer by, Burely they ought to be free to grow
whatever they profitably can. If it doesn't pay them to grow wheat,
they are in effect sine Cerere. Not being allowed the alternative of
cultivating Nicotian crops, they are also sine Baccho. No wonder,
then, that friget Agricultura.

PBEPARATIONS FOE THE ACADEMY BANQUET.
House, and inquire what name? there are that look foreign on the
Academy list, and ask on what kind of understanding the Aoademy
is with the Paris Salon. Shan't speak for more than a quarter uf an
hour—less, probably—short and very sweet. Must praotise smile for
the oooasion. [ Exit to dressiny-ronm.
[By Our Own ilerry-Oo-Riunier, who interviewed 'em.)
Sir Frederick Ltighton, P. R. A. Che* 7ns. Think I 've got some
first-rate speeches for this occasion. Better than anything I've ever
done before. Looked up a splendid selection of new words all of at
lei9t three syllables, and hare still power to add to their number.
Hive been studying the best models,—I mean my own speeches and
those of other great orators of the past. I am sure H.R. H. the
Priuoe of Walks likes listening to a real flow of eloquenoe. I know
he does by his rapt attention, and the graceful bowing of the
head with which he greets ray points, when His Royal Highness's
eyes are slightly closed in deep thought, and the oigar is at his
lips. Regret much that several Kings, Foreign Princes, and Here-
ditary Dukes will not be present, as I shall not have an opportunity
of showing how perfectly I oan master their styles and titles, and
give them several times over, without the slightest hesitation, or the
very smallest mistake. It is quite a lesson to some of my Academi-
cians in foreign pronunciation. Should like to hear my dear old
Millais trying anything of the sort. I oan't help—you [11 excuse
me, caro mio,—bat I really oannot help smiling when I think of it.
I shall speak for half-an-hour, or so, at a time, and though every
sentence will have been well considered, yet most of my hearers
would be ready to swear that it is all impromptu. Are est celare, you
know. Exouse me. I must now leave yoa, to try on my new suit
whioh ha* this moment arrived. So very, very glad to have seen
you. A bientSt.
Mr.R.B. drowning. They 'vegot me instead of Matthew Arnold
this year. He prosed, so I must poetise; not toi muoh; light and
semi-humorous vein, in the Jocoseria style. Shall explain the word
"jocoseria" to the guests: good advertisement for self and book.
Shall touoh, of oourse, on the sister Arts, Poetry and Painting, and
show how one inspired the other, and how Painting owes every-
thing to Poetry,—or, if that isn't exaotly polite, I'if put it t'other
way, and wait till we have a Poetry Dinner, with myself in the Chair
and the Painters as guests, to put the matter in its right and true
light before the world. Jocoseria wants a little lift. Shall allude
gracefully to the President. Ahem! Think they '11 like my speech.
President mayn't care about it (in spite of allusion)—rather too muoh
in the same line. Knowing I'm there, he '11 probably quote some-
thing from me. Excuse me leaving you, I must go and get inspired
and shaved. Hairdresser's waiting.
II. R H. the Prince of Wales [at Marlborough House—just going
out). Oh—tell Mr. Francis Knollts to look up some of my other
speeohes. Ships out something neat and complimentary in a gene-
ral way. Shan't speak for more than five minutes, to set the example
of brevity. Drop a line to Sir Frederick, and say they oan all talk
as muoh as they like—(though there's no necessity to tell 'em that.')
—when onoe the oigars have oommenoed. But we must eome to
oigars sharp after dinner. Time and ToHaoco wait for no man. If
1 see Edinburgh this morning out riding,—(why does he ride?
Sailors ought only to ride at anchor)—I'll tell him not to make a
long speeoh about the Navv. By the way, I '11 take the opportunity
of mentioning the Royal College of Musio, and Edinburgh might
allude to it too. Just work it in quietly. Suppose Mr. George
Grovb will be there. He might respond to "Music" Now
I'm off.
Lord Mayor. Let me see—ah—yes—Discount—no—I mean De-
oant—no—discant or descant (tell Harker to look out word in
Dictionary for me) on the Liberal Arts and the City. Must get a
Latin quotation about Liberal Arts. City always Patron of Arts.
Lorenzo the Magnifioent. Look him out, and see what he did.
Fanoy he was a big City Magnate. If Hakcot/bt's there, opportu-
nity for me to "magnify my offioe." It wants magnifying. Might
point to Lord Mayor's Show, the Coach, the costumes, &c, &<i. The
only thing like Venioe in England. Never perform out of Tendon.
Got half my speech done. Forget if they always drink Lord Mayor's
health, or not. Must go on asking the Artists to Mansion House.
Mr. Lecky. Shall give them something solid. People like listening
to something solid. What will my name be proposed in connection
with? Literature? Or will Browning answer for that? Must get
up something—The Rise of Painting.
Mr. Huxley. Am getting up my speeoh. Idea that Painters were
born, not made. Flattering, this. Shan't include Poets. Djn't
know whether Ttndall won't have to reply. If he does, will keep
this notion back for another time. Hope Sr. George Mivaei will
be there. If he is, hoDe he won't be asked to speak—after me.
Sir John Lubbock. Yes. See my way. Artists, busy bees, Bank
half-holiday. Can work 'em all in. Hope my turn won't come too
late.
H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge. Hum—ha—confound it I Yes—
of oourse. Hang these painter fellows I—(Had to sit to that chap
Holl for hours—got awfully tired—but deuoed clever fellow, and
oapital portrait: very like. Suppose I must say something about it.
Say how tired I was. Hate sitting: if I were a hen might like it.
Ha! ha!)—or hang their pictures! That's what they do, by the
way. Might briug that in, only they don't relish a joke. _ Must
say something about the change of uniform, and the "thin red
line." Dash it, that's a good idea—" thin red line." Must compli-
ment 8ir Frederick as Colonel of Volunteers. Ought to bring in
joke about "no man better able to draw a sword." Anyhow, will
stick to " thin red line "—sure to tell on such an oooasion.
Lord Chief Justice Coleridge. I shall have to reply for the Law.
I wish the Last of the Barons were to be there. But, anyhow, he '11
read the report of my speeoh in the Observer. Might bring in a few
subtle allusions to the Belt case. Of oourse, the Last of the Barons
gave up all his ohanoe of being asked to the Royal Aoademy Dinner

ODE TO SPRING.
{By Landeau.)
Miss Spring, I will sing you a welcome in quite an original strain,
Which I am sure you will find a relief, dear, because it is rather more sane
Than the annual drivel that's written to herald the primrose and swallows,
The hyacinth blue, and the snowdrop—the sure stock-in-trade of Apollos.
In my way I'm as true an admirer of you as the poets who sing
Of the flowers at a shilling a-piece, and the bees that most painfully sting.
Sweet Spring, I admit I don't love you because " the wan Winter is dead,"
Or the violet and primrose and crocus are flaunting a flare in each bed,—
Nor because every bird in the country is pairing and building its nest,—
For when nightingales keep one from sleeping, I admit they are rather a pest,
Nor beoause the blaok hawthorn as usual bursts forth into white bridal blossom,
Nor beoause some poor moulting cock-robin gets a gaudy new crest on his bosom.
Bat I love you, sweet time of the Hoses, 'cause you bring back the beau rnonde
to town,
When eaoh matron, each maid, and eaoh widow will flaunt in diaphanous gown,
When the Orosvenor is something to talk of, and the season of racing 'a com-
menced,
When it's jolly to shave with cold water, and not even prudes are incensed
If you hint they look cool as cucumbers as they sit in the Row 'neath the trees,
All watching intently the walkers, the riders, the drivers, the " gees."
Ere Eton and Harrow is over, and the Derby blue-ribbon is won,
When Gardenias are common as daisies, and peaohes are sold by the ton.
When one lunches off strawberries and cream at Guntkr's, and dines off an ioe,
And. sups off a out of pine-apple—my mouth waters now for a slice.
When one tools down a coach to the Orleans, or purloins someone's sweetheart
or glove,
When my Nora comes baok from the country to play at lawn-tennis and love,
When one's mornings and evenings are spent in cob-riding, cab-driving, or
walking,
When invitations to dinner are rife, and it's even too sultry for talking;
When one's nights are some spent at the Opera, and
lounging, and supping, and dances,
Making love at Botanical night fetes, or watching young
lovers' romances.
When on Saturdays Hurlingham's orowded, and Sun-
days are piously spent
Up the River at Richmond or Tagg's, or lying in ham-
mock or tent,
With an iced lemon-squash at one's elbow, and a hand-
kerchief over one's face
That's soented with Eau de Cologne that came from
one's lady-love's oase,
Or puffing a cigarette punotured with "P. M. and Co."
at one's ease,
A Ouida-like hero, that nothing but midges and girls
dare to tease.
It's not that I bear any malice to flowers—I rather
admire them,
I believe that they grow in the country—I know that
from Willis we hire them!
But you see I'm not much in the country, except in the
Winter for shooting,
And London's the best place in Summer, beyond any
kind of disputing.
I'm always unhappy in Winter, and Autumn's deplor-
ably slow,
But in Springtime and Summer, while sitting in my
pretty green chair in the Row,
I own I am happy, and therefore I love you, sweet
mother of flowers,
In spite of your Leonine March winds, and your
treacherous April showers.
And the cause of my loving—I know it is horribly weak
when admitted;
But Truth, like Murder, will out, and it's awfully nice
to be pitied!
Is simply and solely, sweet Spring-time—don't Lynch
me, ye Poets, for treason—
Not beoause fields are in flower—it may be bad taste—
but the reason
I love you, sweet Spring-time, is really 'cause you herald
the London " Season."
A DUTY ON DOCTORS.
Tbtr Council of the College of Surgeons in Lincoln's
Inn Fields, dear Mr. Punch, has issued a circular,
addressed to Fellows and Members, pointing out certain
provisions of the Medical Amendment Bill of which they
suggest that so many Amendments should be made.
The clauses they denounce are four in number, Sir, and
the fourth clause threatens those Fellows and those
Members with a penalty so unmerited that the menace
of it ought really to enlist on their behalf the sympathy
of every other fellow endowed with any fellow-feeling.
Vivacious friends will, therefore, excuse a quotation
whioh is indeed no joke. The Council objeot, fourthly,
to the Bill above named:—
"That power would be taken by Clause 38 of the Bill to
levy on every Practitioner already registered a vexatious annual
tax, the non-payment of which would involve the liability to
removal of his name from the Register."
Consequently, Mr. Punch} disqualification to practise
his profession. In effect, dispossession of his diploma.
Professional ruin, Sir. Wouldn't that be rather too
heavy a forfeiture for a Praotitioner's failure to pay a
fine on a practice whence the income may be all''in
supposition" P Would it not be a truly vexatious
superaddition to a poor Practitioner's Income-tax?
Can the Legislature possibly mean to saddle poor
Pilgarlio with a Profession-tax as well, Mr. Punch f
The Medical Profession altogether, as you know, Sir,
has long discarded the practice of bleeding, except in
very exceptional cases. Have the " Leeches" no friends
in the House of Commons who will preserve them from
being themselves bled at such a rate and in such a way
as that in which the framers of the new Medical Bill
propose to stick it into them P Talk of barbarity, what '■
vivisection to suoh venesection as that P
Excuse, dear Sir, this too, too arid appeal for sympathy
and succour in the name of
Sawbones.

ANNEXATION MADE EASY.
{A Page from the Future Journal of the House of Lords.)
Lord C-bn-bv-n wished to know if there was any truth in the
newspaper report that the whole interior of Equatorial Africa,
including the Great Sahara and the sources of the Nile, the Niger,
and the Congo, had just been annexed to the British Empire by the
Deputy-Governor of Heligoland.
Lord D- mi v assured the Noble Lord that the Foreign Offioe was in
its usual convenient state of utter official ignorance, and complete
actual knowledge, of the circumstances alluded to by the Noble Lord.
It was true that a telegram had been received from the Deputy-
Governor of Heligoland, in which that official stated that, in the
temporary absence of the Governor from his post, through toothache,
it had been decided by the Executive Government of the island to
annex all Africa, or as much of it as remained to annex. The
Executive Government, consisting of himself and an Offioe Boy, had
arrived—so the Deputy-Governor telegraphed—at the above resolu-
tion unanimously, and the Office Boy had consented to head an expe-
dition to Africa for the purpose of taking formal possession of the
regions which were now an integral portion of the British Empire.
There was every reason to believe, the telegram added, that the
expedition would be successful, as the Offioe Boy was provided with
a tolerably seaworthy boat, some antique fire-arms, and twenty-five
shillings and sixpence, being half the Heligoland revenue for the
current year; but nothing (Lord D-bby said) had yet been heard of
his arrival in Africa. He (Lord D-rby) was not prepared at once
to state whether he approved or disapproved of the annexation.
Africa, no doubt, was a large country, and Heligoland was a small
one. He would wait and see exactly how much opposition the
annexation occasioned, both at home and abroad, before deciding
whether it was a grossly immoral or a highly patriotic step for the
Heligoland Government to take. He was sure his noble friend would
not expeot him to give a definite opinion one way or the other just at
present. The House would agree with him that they must await the
further development of events, and that until the arrival of the Office
Boy in some part of the annexed dominions it would be premature
to discuss the matter, and such disoussion might even tend to em-
barrass the action of the Government. He believed that the calcu-
lation made by the noble Lord was tolerably accurate, and that it
was true that the population of the annexed province might be put at
somewhere about ten or twenty millions, while the population of
Heligoland was under one thousand. The olimate of Central Africa
was not so bad as it had been represented. However, the House
would of course understand that he was not attempting to defend the
annexation at present, though he could not tell what view he might
not adopt after the proper amount of Papers had been laid on the
Table, and if it were really ascertained that no serious opposition
would be made to the annexation. At present the Deputy-Governor
had acted entirely on his own responsibility, as also had the Office—
Boy, and both could be thrown over and dismissed if the
turned out a failure
tele,
thing-
He might add that the Deputy-Governor had
. ed that Despatches, explaining the whole occurrence, were
on their way to England, but that—in order that the Foreign Offioe
might not have an opportunity of meddling in its usual idiotic
manner before the annexation was complete,—he had taken the pre-
caution to send the Despatches round by the North Pole, so that they
would not reach England for three months or so. This, Lord D-Hb i
said, was extremely thoughtful of the Deputy-Governor, as it save(j
the necessity of coming to any immediate decision, and three montli
was ample time for the Office Boy either to found a new Empire i S
Africa, or to get comfortably drowned on his way out there.

MISTAKEN IMPRESSIONS.

No. 66.—Depression.
No. 59.—Fly-paper Impressions.
No. 46.-
-Nihilists Trapped, or Imp-russi mists
in Prison.
I think I may fairly say that the generally-mistaken'1 Impression-
ists" have come to the right place at last. They ought to leave an in-
delible mark on New Bond Street—at least, for the rest of the season.
I had been induced to look in at their Collection by "an artistic friend
who advised me to go and see it, because he was told it was " horrid
funny." So I looked in. I had been posted up in the principles of
the School. "The idea is, the first impression the picture produces
on you, you know. They don't care how they get the effect as long
as they get it," I heard somebody say, as I was creeping along a
narrow passage that gave me my first impression—that of having
my head in the way in a rifle-gallery. Still, I was quite prepared
to be further "impressed " when I got into the room. And I was.
I was impressed by the impressive manner of the self-oontained
attendant, a melancholy young man, who seemed so anxious that the
pictures should produoe a favourable impression on intending pur-
chasers, or, indeed, on anybody, that he moved about quite sadly,
evidently much pained by the unsuppressed jeers they somehow pro-
voked. Then I took a hurried look round, and reeeived another
impression. It was that I had wasted a shilling.
At first I thought I had got into the "Children's" Gallery by
mistake, and that they had been getting up a little Exhibition of
their own for my amusement. However, I turned to the Catalogue
to see what it was all about, and found I had really got among the
Impressionists, and that it was all right, and that " the oonnoisseur
would recognise in the wonderful effects of light, the complete com-
mand of colour, and the faculty of delineating the more fleeting aspects
to which landscape and the human figure are susceptible, a very
interesting and distinctive faotor in the Art-work of modern times."
Certainly, Borne of the effects of light were most wonderful. I
never saw anything like them before—anywhere. And as to the
"complete command of colour," several of the Artists seem, unques-
tionably, to have had an unlimited run on " Reckitt's Blue." The
J' Art-work of modern times," however, afforded me one pleasing
impression—I noticed that there was not much of it.
But as everybody ought to see what there is, here are a few rough
"impressions," illustrated above by our extremely impressionable
Artist, and jotted down "hot"—just as they were received—that
will help out a reference to the Catalogue :—
No. 13. "Femmt au Piano." Kenoir. "Cottage" landscape.
Distant view of flats. "Woman playing a Trip-to-lhe-Moonlight Sonata.
No. 14. Another "Femme," this time " dans unjardin." Might be
called " Folkestone to Boulogne." Impression produced. She has got
the Artist to sketch the whole of her in three colours, because she has,
very unwisely, eaten all the rest of his box—paints, palette, and all,
before he began.
No. 45. "Le Sac de L'ltle de La Loge." Sibley. First impression
produced. "If this is the back, perhaps it's a trifle better in
front." Second impression. "Arrangement for drying clothes.
Artist determined to be hung on his own line?" Precisely.
No. 46. ".Thirteen Barf Rest," or, "Victims inside a Cage at
Feeding-time t " or what? Can't make it out. Sole impression pro-
duced (by style of dress)—that it has been on the Artist's hands about
three-and-twenty years. Yet M. Manet only asks £400 for it I
Won't go off. Manet. Too bad of it. a great deal I
No. 56. "Chapeaux." Degas. No mistake here. Impression,
this time, clearly on the Hats—that have been sat upon. Poetry of
the idea evident. Felt as soon as seen. Alight have had a quotation
in Degas Metre?
No. 58. "French Polo." M. Degas. (A regular illumination of
gas on this wall)—calls it " Le Depart Jockey's." Why? Because
he has taken more than half a horse off his canvas? Why didn't
he content himself with cutting it off at the Mane P
No. 59. "Femmes Appuyies ear une Bampe." Further supply of
Degas! Better though if this Degas had been turned out. More
like a symphony of backs. Or are they moths? Melancholy colour-
ing. Only three of them.
No. 61. "Femme dans une Loge." Final flare-up of Degas.
But not much light here—should be called, "Before Seven; or, an
Order for One to the Upper Boxes."
With No. 65 the Catalogue ends, but if the " Connoisseur" is
anxious to be still further impressed, and also a little puzzled, he
can push on into a dark room at the back, and be requested to put
his name down for an Artist's proof of Mr. J. Fobbes Robertson's
Pioture of the Church Scene in Much Ado About Nothing, " painted,"
as the Catalogue informs him, "expressly for Henky Ibvino, Esq."
The point of this interesting work appears to be the subtle and
ingenious art with whioh the identity of everybody concerned has
been carefully concealed. No room for jealousy. Even the legs of
all the Gentlemen are much alike. "Why not call it either " Who '#
Who t "—or "A Prize Puzzle—Find the Manager" t

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, April 23.—Affirmation Bill
on to-night for Seoond Reading:. Everything; dreadfully dull.
"Nothing; like the old times, Toby," Captain Gossbt said, mourn-
fully regarding Bradlaugh as he sat under the Gallery. "Onee
used to come up like a man, and have it out on the floor of the
House, regardless of his stylographio pen. Now sits there like an
ordinary Member, and I've got no work to do. Fancy I rather
oowed him last time. Gave him enongh for the duration of this
Parliament. If I'd thought of it, would have dissembled a bit."
Attorney-General made nice Nisi Prius speeoh. Sir R. Cross
chirruped round the question more than ever like a Magisterial
sparrow. But couldn't get up excitement. Once, indeed, House
burst into a roar of laughter when Grand Cross caught another
smile. It was the Attorney-General who was this time detected.
G. C. was reading a long extract from paper. Right Hon. Gentle-
men on the Treasury Bench relapsed from the oondition of ostenta-
tious good behaviour preserved when he fixes a small but glittering
eye upon them. But old schoolmaster instincts not to be overoome.
Lulled them into security for a few moments; then suddenly looked
up, and caught Sir Henry James "flagrante de smilo," as Mr.
Barkan, who knows a little Latin, says.
"The Attorney-General Bmiles!" Sir R. Cross cried in severe
warning tones; whereupon the House went off into fit of laughter
that lasted for several seconds, Sir Richard angrily regarding
Members, and wondering what he had said to amuse them.
Basinets done.—Second Reading Affirmation Bill moved.
Tuesday Night.—Mr. Wiggin down early to-day, moving busily
about House and Lobby.
"Look out for a storm, Toby, my boy," said Mr. Puleston.
"Wiggin's Last was not a great success. But he's not likely to
make another mistake."
Storm sure enough. Question of the Blowholes on. and the House
trembling with exoitement. Dramatic meteorological effeot arranged
by the Wary Wieenr. Wind turned on at the East blows down
Embankment sending fumes into Palace Yard. Smells as if it were
washing day in the City. Members hastily cross yard with hand-
kerohief to nose, determined to vote early and vote often against
Blowholes. Funny part of business is, that the Waggish Wigqin
turns out to have been engaged on other side. Speaks in favour of
decision of Committee.
"What is the meaning of this?" Sir Edward Watktw says,
ooming up with evident intention to give the Member for East Staf-
ford a Wiggin. "What do you mean by turning on the storm so as
it blows the smell right into the House. You've spoiled the whole
case—ruined us."
"Very sorry," says the Worried Wioonr. "Not my fault. As
the Poet says—
I did think at least.
With the wind in the East,
The smell would not travel due West.
Nothing can be dearer than that; can it, Sir Edward? But
there's no accounting for storms and winds, and I mean to go out of
the business."
Arthur Balfour, who was on the Committee which sanctioned
the Blowholes, very wrath at demonstration against them. Speaks
soornfully of taste in the City, and heaps words of contumely on the
Metropolitan Board of Works as represented by Sir James Hoog .
Sir Georgb Elliot, caressing his waistcoat with open palms as if
he were cautiously searching for a pin, takes House into his con-
fidence. Sir Gkokor so exceedingly confidential that there is great
difficulty in hearing him at a distance of ten feet. Members near
throng round to catch his words. Right Honourable Gentlemen on
the Front Opposition Bench crane their Decks. Excited Members out
of hearing angrily cry, "Speak upl" But Sir Geobgx, still gently
rubbiDg his waistcoat, with look of profound wisdom on his shining
countenance, goes on in confidential whisper. Creep close up, and find
Sir George relating how when Blowholes first projected he "told 'em
they wouldn't do. Should put up "a tall chimbley," somewhere,
—"an unobtrusive chimbley," Sir George adds, in lower whisper,
and with a confidential nod to the Speaker. "A ohimbley as tall as
the Shot-tower^that would have made a draught and taken all the
smell away." House doesn't seem to be enohanted with the chimbley
idea. It is, moreover, plainly too late to build it this afternoon, so
go to a Division, and the Blowholes clean blown out by a majority of
200 against 110.
Wednesday, — Freeh claimant for Leadership of Conservative
Party turned up from an unexpected quarter. Henry Richard
brings in New Burial BilL Grand Cross, having considered it
and heard Harcourt on behalf of Plaintiff, gives judgment for
Seoond Reading. Mr. Salt put up to announce this. Faithful Con-
servatives accept instruction. Bill about to pass when Berksford
Hope appears on scene, and moves rejection of the Bill.
At first sign of revolt, the Party leaves Grand Cross, to whom
Parliamentary life is growing increasingly puzzling. Did not the
Party, only the other day, impatiently howl him down when he pro-
posed to make a prosy patronising speech on Explosives Bill P Time
was when all his thoughts were considered wise, and all his words
beautiful. Getting a little frightened at turn events are taking.
Wishes he hadn't interfered. Fortunately did not make a speech.
Only put up Salt. Rises now; says Bill might pass Seoond Read-
ing only for the 7th Clause. But, with the 7th Clause, wild horseB
shall not tear from him consent.
Implacable and inconvenient Lord Randolph wants to know
whether 7th Clause has been added within last twenty minutes P
Wasn't it in the Bill when Salt, on part of Front Opposition Bench-
assented to Second Reading P
Fine opportunity this for Randolph, and he makes most of it,
chaffing two Front Benches, making Sir Richard very Ctobs indeed,
and quaintly commenting upon various absences. Maddens Grandiose
Old Man, terrifies Osborne Morgan, amuses the House, and has a
high old time. Having pursued the joke for a quarter of an hour,
gave time to Gorst to see it. and presently "Old Six-and-Eight-
penny," as Joseph Gillis, with characteristic levity, calls the learned
Member for Chatham, rises and goes through it all over again, with
a " Where's this Member P " and " Where rs that Minister?"
"Where are the Law Offioers of the Crown P Can you produce a
Law Offioer of the Crown?" he says to Harcourt, as if the Homb-
Secretary were in the habit of keeping an assortment in his waist-
coat-pocket.
Business done.—Cemetery Bill talked out, in spite of support of
Front Opposition Benoh. Randolph showed once more who is the
real Conservative Leader.
Thursday Night.—Howe crowded from floor to ceiling. Glad-
stone expected to speak on Affirmation Bill. General impulse when
anyone else announced to speak on subject to get away as quickly as
possible and remain away as long as convenient. Everyone siok to
death of it. _ Only interesting portion of Debate at any time
was that in which Serjeant-at-Arms took part. Cut out of the play
now, and leaves it wearisome beyond description. Supposed to be
Debate on question of Abolishing Parliamentary Oath. Really,
Debate on Bradlaugh.
"Like the Forest of Arden, in Orlando's time, had 'Rosalind'
carved on every tree, so," Bays Arthur Balfour, "we've 'Brad-
laugh ' staring us in the face at every turn of the debate."
Still believed Grand Old Man equal to infusing the debate with
fresh life and vigour. So he does.
"Magnificent!" Mr. Gibson says, as the Old Man Eloquent sits
down after a spin of an hour and a half. "Magnificent, but not
votes. Every man has made up his mind how he '11 vote. Might as
well have divided on Monday."
"Then why didn't you?" I asked.
"Ah! go away, now, Toby," said Gibson, in his mellifluous
tones. "You're too young and too innocent altogether for this
place. This is your first Parliament. I daresay you'll improve, if
you live long enough. How 're things down in Berks now r Got a
Caucus your way P"
When the Grand Old Man sat down there was a pause. No one
seemed quite to like to suggest comparisons by immediately follow-
ing him. Presently pair of arms seen waving from below the Gang-
way on Conservative side, and a familiar voice heard.
It's Stanley Leighton," murmured Stafford Northcote,
feeling for his hat behind Lord John Manners' legs. "Truly
there s only one stop from the sublime to the ridiculous; " and Sir
Stafford, falling in with the stream of Members pouring out, left
"The Man from Shropshire" gesticulating and bawling as if he d
discovered some fresh evidence about his property in Chsnoery, and
believed the time had come when the Lord Chancellor should hear
him. Business done.—Customs and Inland Revenue Bill read a
Seoond Time.
Friday.—Another open question dosed to-night. Looal Option
Resolution adopted by Government and carried by large majority.
Grand Old Man advanced by three courses. First (three years ago),
voted against Resolution; Secondly, abstained from voting; Lastly,
voted for it. Grand Cross wild and a little incoherent. Wants to
read to House a few columns of Premier's speech on the subject.
House politely but firmly declines.
"Everything an open question now," said Stafford Northcote,
with unwonted bitterness. "They '11 leave us nothing to yield upon
when we come in." _—_——==
"Great fuss being made about this Prinoe CRACXParxm," says
Mrs. Ramsbotham. Bhe had heard one of herNephews ontb^ Stock
Exchange singing " The Crackpot in the (My," and thought that
this had something to do with it.

That so large a picture,
Treated so ideally—
Not that thai means stricture—
Fogs us to find room for it;

That were sorry doom for it.
Very melancholy
Is our present duty;
We its strength admiring,
Conscious of its beauty.
Ah I oar task is tiring.
Space so straitly bounded,
Canvasses so many,
Getting quite confounded!
Every daubing zany
Anxious for a place.

All our oounoils; round it
Earthquake and eclipse
Ever seem to hover.

So muoh wall-space cover

Crowded out we find.

But, as we 're about full,
It must, for the present,
Stand aside as " Doubtful."

RATHER IRREGULAR.
Without our Morning Postal "Arrangements for To-day"
regularly every morning, we should be nowhere—not in it—or, to put
it poetically, we should be all abroad—"anywhere, anywhere out of
the world," and, certainly, not at home all day. But, apologising
to the Editor in the most Lord-Chief-Justioian style, we would
humbly suggest, that for the sake of the fashionable but unintelligent
foreigner who is not au courant with our times and seasons, the
"arrangements" might be set in ohronologioal order. Thus, why
should the Catalogue be as we give it below, observing the order, but
slightly altering the names:—
Arrangements fob To-dat.
Mrs. Bunnion's First Dance.
Bacea- Claremarket Spring; Currah.
Chuckingham Club—Collar* and final ties, April Foolscap last day.
Scientific Societies, &c.—Koyal Constitution, 2; Boyal Society, Cafe Boyal,
Kegent Street, 3; Mashers' Lecture, 6.
May Meetings or May not—Buddhist and Bloomsbury Missionary Meeting.
Companies' Meetings, Associations, &o.—Jo-MiUeritea Meeting at Asylum
for Idiots. Earls wood, for discussing " Shall India have a comic song; or,
who 'a going to hinder yer?"
The details are unimportant. But why commence the day with a
dance f Of course, to a great many Belgravians the first thing to be
thought of when they wake in the morning is, where are we going
to-night? But the Foreigner above-mentioned would form, from
these published arrangements, a curious idea of our English customs.
He would write, "They begin the day with a dance, whioh, being
regularly affichi in the papers, is, of course, open to all persons. So
far more truly Republican are they here, under a Monarchy, than
we in Paris under a Republic. Then after the dance they go to
Races. Then back to town to see Athletic Sports, and in the after-
noon they tranquillise themselves with some Science, some Church
meetings, &c, &c. Such is life in London, without mentioning the
theatres and public-houses." Mrs. Bcnnion—who certainly deserves
her " first dance "—poor thing t—might have it down for the usual
time at night instead of making it the commencement of the Arrange-
ments for the Day.

and I assure him that should he, unfortunately, he oompelled to
retire for awhile into seclusion, that he should be able to add to their
force by mature and astute and uninterrupted reconsideration. But
Mr. Lego must forgive me for saying that it is not an argument in
his favour to urge that other caricaturists have escaped punishment.
Supposing that a Duke were to steal a mantelpiece (Mr. Lego will
excuse the analogy), it will be no argument in the burglarious Duke's
favour to deolare that other Peers of equal rank have escaped dis-
covery, and consequent punishment. In conclusion, the matter must
be left to the Jury. They would deoide wisely. The issue was a
simple one. Mr. Lego would either be permitted to oontinue his
truly admirable work in peaoe and comfort, or he would be forced
(Mr. Lego would forgive him the suggestion) to spend all his leisure
tor many weeks in the cell of a prison.

THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF PAINTERS IN WATER-
COLOURS.
The Water-cure in Pall-Mall seems to be as popular and successful
as heretofore The bright, vigorous, healthy character of the pro-
ductions of the inmates of this establishment is steadfastly main-
tained. Sir Wilfrid Lawson should certainly be eleoted an honorary
Member, seeing the brilliant and extraordinary effects that water
seems to be capable of producing. Sir John Gilbert is as versatile
and Rubenesque as ever, Mr. T. J. Watson has some truthful
landscapes, Mr. H. M. Marshall some wonderful transcripts of life
in our London streets, "Our" Mr. Du Maubxer a piquante picture
of Society, and Mr. Birkett Foster some pleasant oountry scenes.
There is a charming drawing by Mr. John Ruskin, truthful studies
by Mr. G. P. Boyce, and delicately rendered figure-subjects by Mr.
E. E. Johnson. There are also contributions by Mrs. Alllnoham
and Mr. Holm an Hunt, with drawings by Messrs. S. P. Jackson,
E. Buchanan. A. P. Newton, H. 8. Mares, E. J. Potnter, A. W.
Hunt, Carl Haag, A. D. Fbjpp, and others which call for especial
attention. A capital collection in all of over three hundred pictures.
So suooessful is this hydropathio establishment, that its Members
might well sing au adaptation of an old Temperance Song, " 0, water
for me! Bright water for me! Give oil to the tremulous debauchee!'
Waiter! {garqnn) have you some bread, some cutlets, some beef,
some preserved strawberry j*m-tart {confiture aux /raises), and some
(rood wine {du bon vin)? Yes, Sir; here they are (vmld). Ah! my
dear friend (mnn cher ami), sit opposite {vis-a-vis) me. Call the
Waiter, and tell him we lunch together {ensemble).
The wine is good, the bread is excellent, the beef is appetising.
Excuse me one moment (un moment) I see Madame X going up
{monter) to the Gallery. I must {tl faut) speak to her. She has
asked me to show (indiquer) her Mrs.' Joplino's pictures and Miss
Montalba's {ceux de Mile. Montalba). You are coming baok {dt
retmr), are you not {n'est-ce pas)? Yes; I shall come back.
Waiter! the Gentleman who was with me will come back and pay
for his own share. No, Sir {Non, Monsieur), you must pay for
the two. It is too bad; I will speak to (m'addresser) Mr. Comtns
Carr. or to Sir Coutts. All that is nothing to me (lout yo ne me
regarde pas); you have (1/ faut absolument) to pay for two soups, two
fish, two beefs, two vegetables {legumes), one bottle of the best {le
meilleur) wine, two breads, two butters.
There is the money. I am angry. I will not give anything {ne-rien)
to the waiter. The pictures are in the Gallery above, but his friend
is no longer to be seen {visible). Where is that gentleman {ee mon-
sieur) P He is gone {il est parti). Did he say when he would return?
No; he did not say when he would return. He has taken my over-
coat (par-dessus), my oatalogue, and my new umbrella {parapluie).
I will hasten {me presser) to seek {chercher) him. Another day I will
look at the piotures.

The Lord Chief Justice, after an exhaustive history of oarioa-
ture in all its branches, from the time of the Flood up to the Nine-
teenth Century, then addressed himself to the subject-matter of the
case. He said—Mr. Leog I am sure will forgive me if I misrepre-
sent him, but I certainly understood him to observe, "Some of my
work is admirably artistic, but the remainder is certainly crude, not
to say ooarse." This he has put forth in an extremely able manner,
and what he says is well worthy of your attention. He adds, with
much cleverness, that some of the caricaturists of the past century
were equally severe and coarse. Now, I am sure he will forgive me
if I say that I should not have made any difference between theBe
caricaturists of the past century and himself. Had those carica-
turists been brought before me (as I am heartily glad they were not)
I should have sentenced them (I ask Mr. Lego's pardon) as I may
have to sentence him. Mr. Lkgo says that many people pay a very
large prioe for carioatures. I do not doubt it, and 1 cannot suffi-
ciently compliment Mr. Lego upon the great researoh he has shown
in collecting the facts he has so exhaustively and clearly set before
you. But I can only say that the Artists of these works will find
that I will punish them, although the first to admit their talent and
wit. Mr. Lego must forgive me if I say that in the event of a
verdict being found against him, he will find me the reverse of
lenient. It will pain me excessively to have to cause inconvenience
to Mr. Lego, who is an admirable scholar and a most aooomplished
linguist, but business is business, and a misdemeanor (Mr. Lego
will pardon me) oan only be atoned for by fine and imprisonment.
Still, Mr. Legg's arguments are deserving of every consideration,
"Conversion of Rbvtks."—Mrs. Ramsbotham has seen this
heading every day for a fortnight past in all the papers. She wants
to know who " Rentes" is, and to what, and from what, he is con-

Did " Local Option " find unfeigned voice,

The Affirmation Principles.—A Constable, ordered to searoh
the cellars of the Houses of Parliament for explosive material, on
being presented with a safety-lamp, refused to carry it, Baying that
he had a conscientious objeotion to taking his Davy—or anybody
else's.

the best French soup in ordinary use is "a good brouitlon."

along rapidly until—
"Mr. Justice Field said no
cause for action was shown, and

the plaintiff continued to waste
the public time, he should exer-
cise the power rested in him,
and cauic his removal from the

"Mr. Hind said he had not

to the application being dismissed

"Mr. Justice Field—We shall

"Appeal dismissed, with costs."

That the project is the one thing that can'save England from

That it is an idea that will, if carried out, destroy the British
Empire.
That it will be a great financial success, having about eight hun-
dred trains a day, with some couple of dozen million passengers.
That it will entail bankruptcy upon all who touch it, and will have
not more than two trains per diem, with about twenty passengers.
_ That it will cost three millions. That it will also cost twenty-

That it can be constructed in two months. That it will take
twenty years in excavation. That with vigour it ought to be
finished in a fortnight.
That it should belong to Sir E. Watkin. That it should be bought
by the Government. That it should be open to everybody. That
nobody should use it.
That it oould be easily defended by a fort built by Sir E. Watkin,
whose knowledge of Military Engineering would thus be put to the

That it would take the whole of the Fleet and the entire Army,

That commerce would increase a hundredfold, as goods from the

That no goods could be sent by the submarine route, as the expense

A NEW THEATRICAL REGULATION BILL.
If the Earl of Onslow wants to bring in a really useful Bill for
regulating Theatrical matters, we beg to present him with a few
suggestions:—
That it shall be made an offence at Common Law, or indictable for
any person to continue practioe as a Theatrioal Amateur in any line
after he or she thall have pasted the age o£ twenty-flee, without a
special licence having been previously obtained from a Committee
constituted, according to the terms of the present Act, of Dramatio
Authors. Professional Actors, and one Common-Law Judge.
That the cost of obtaining such an aforesaid special licence shall
be not less than £50 and not more than £300, according to the con-
dition of the applicant, which sums shall go to such charitable pur-
poses as the Committee may appoint.
That all Amateurs professing to play for any Charity shall only be
permitted to do so on payment of ten guineas to the Treasurer of
such Charity.
That the Dramatio Authors, or Authors and Composers whose
pieces are represented by.Amateurs shall be compelled by Law to
demand exactly three times the amount of their ordinary fees for
each representation, whether such representation be for charity or
for no specified object.
That no licenoe be granted to any Lady Amateur oyer forty, nor
to any Gentleman Amateur over forty-live.
That no licence be granted for more than a year.
That all such licences expire finally, for Ladies, at the age of forty,
and for Gentlemen at forty-five.
And any Lady or Gentleman, over the above-mentioned ages,
aying in any performance whatever, except as a properly engaged
and salaried member of a regular Professional Company, shall be
fined for the first offence £50, for the second £100, and for the third
imprisonment for not more than two years.
That any Professional Actor bringing out a novioe to play Juliet,
or any leading part in any piece whatever, shall be fined £100 for the
first offence, shall be imprisoned for the second, and banished the
country for the third.
That any Amateur, Lady or Gentleman, whether acting under
advice, as a pupil, or otherwise playing any leading part in any piece
whatever at an evening performance, or at a Matmie, shall be in-
dicted by the Director of Pablio Prosecutions for the murder of suoh
Stage-character, and thall be proceeded against as the Act directs.
That designs for new Theatres be forthwith laid before a Council
of Professional men, including the principal Metropolitan and Pro-
vincial Managers (but no architects or builders) under the presidency
of Captain Shaw.
That all existing Theatres be gradually pulled down and rebuilt
on the places agreed to by the Council above-named.
That every Theatre having existed under one and the same
Management for over three years shall be taken to possess a reper-
toire of its own, from which it shall select two pieces to alternate
wiih the nights of any new production, so that there shall be a
variety of performances every week, the new piece being played for
four nights and one Matinee, and the old pieces for two nights. This
will keep the Actors in good working order, will induce a number of
Eeople to revisit the Theatre, and generally advance the interests of
'ramatic Art.
Dramatio Authors' fees shall be fixed at a certain scale of per-
centage for all pieces whether new or old, and four tickets for the
stalls, .'and two dress-circle tickets or one box shall be at their
disposal on the nights when these pieces are played.
That no Actor or Actress] in receipt .of a salary at the rate of
£1000 per annum shall take a benefit.
That any Actor or Actress introducing any words, phrases,
speeches, commonly called "gags," of their own into any piece what-
soever shall, on the case being clearly proved against them before the
nearest sitting Magistrate, be fined two weeks' salary for the first
offence, four for the second, and so on.
Should the Actor plead that he or she has the Author's permission
for such "gag," the permission in question must be in writing,
duly witnessed, stamped, and produced in Court.
That anybody proved to be a member of any Churoh-and-Stage
Guild shall be detained during Her Majesty's pleasure in Hanwell,
St. Luke's, or Colney Hatch.

"THE SILVER STREAK."
"It seemed to him that if we had no way into or out of the country except
by sea, our position was a most dangerou) one. We ought not to be content
to go on living in this fools' paradiae, dependent for everything on the sea."
Sir Edward WAMiKVi Evidence on the Channel Tunnel.
We have Bung very oft Britons ne'er shall be slaves,
And boasted Bbitannia rules oVr the waves,
But now. if we trust Edwaed Watkin, it seems
We've all been indulging in dangerous dreams:
That Railway Colossus declares it to be
Quite shocking that England's surrounded by sea.
We had thought we were strong, but he swears we are weak,
And it's all on account of the Sea's Silver Streak.
We had fanoied this tight little island of ours
Was better untouched by all neighbouring Powers,
That, as an observer could note at a glanoe.
The sea made us safer than Spain or than Franoe;
That while on the Continent all flew to arms,
The Ocean preserved us from foreign alarms;
But it's quite a mistake, we are shookingly weak,
And it's all on acoount of that Sad Silver Streak.
'Tie of course just your game, good Sir Edward, we know,
To back up the Tunnel and fight for your Co.;
To vow that we shall be more prosperous far,
When close-linked to France, than as just as we are.
The Sea's not a danger, Sir Edwabd, that's flat,
And England oan't swallow such twaddle as that;
'Tis the Tunnel will make us most probably weak,
And there's safety we '11 swear in the Sea's Silver Streak I
GRAND OPENING OF THE NEW PICCADILLY
WATERWORKS.
{Tu>o First Visits, Thursday and Friday, April 26 and 27.)
Oh, didn't I hear of these jolly Young Watermen! and didn't I
determine to be in my place and at theirs for the opening ceremony!
Rather I The idea haunted me. I had restless nights, and thought
at last that I should be prostrated with Water-colour on the brain.
But Thursday morning came at last. An uncertain day—a water-
coloury sort of day, which—may the omen be propitious!—turned
out remarkably fine. I was determined to be the first on the scene.
My cabman, with a watery-ooloury eye, but gin-and-watery voice,
took advantage of my being deeply immersed in an article on the
Impressionists by one of the Morning Postmen to drive me to
Holborn, because he said he had understood me to say the " New
Buildings," whioh he took to mean the First Avenue Hotel with the
scaffolding up, and, on my explaining to him his mistake, he was
for driving me to the Aquarium (a nearer approach to the Water-
Colours), had I not risked my neck dv putting my head out of the
window—it was a fourwheeler—and shouting at him the exact
direction, which at length brought him up at the entrance to the
New Galleries of the Institute in Piccadilly.
Here everything showed me I was among the Painters. They
were hard at work, brushes in their hands, and paint-pots by their
side, at the doors. A warning with regard to " Wet Paint" was the
first thing that caught my eye at the foot of the staircase, and made
me at once distrustful and uncomfortable. Whatever it might be up
above in the Galleries, below it was "Varnishing Day," and the
Painters at work were all " Artists in oil,"—very much in oil. This
was an odd beginning,—English work, and Italian oil.
The Galleries had a bright, fresh, and wholesome look, and were
well open to the daylight. Pictures with loftiest aims did not appear
to me to be "skied," but were all well placed, and the general
appearance decidedly attractive. "The Press," at that early hour,
was represented by two Gentlemen who were doubtful as to where to
place their great-coats and umbrellas, and who apparently experi-
enced some difficulty in keeping clear of the upholstering men
engaged in laying down new carpets by the aid of a sort of miniature
pitchfork, and a small edition of a NaBmyth hammer, and over whom
the Critics, shading their eyes and making lorgnettes with their
hands, as they backed to focus their "private views," were perpetu-
ally stumbling, and not distinctly apologising. It didn't take long,
however, for the Busy Bees to seleot the flowers where the best
honey was to be found, and which would prove most attractive to
the general Public, with whom, during the Season, these Baloons
will be a favourite resort.
.lEstheticism is but scantily represented. Here and there some
unhealthy group of stiffly-outlined figures may, like John Leech's
"Gent a-blowin' of his baooy" on the drag, spile the lot." But
this is quite exceptional. Life and health are fully represented; and
the visitor is not depressed by siokly tints and unwholesome effeminate
beings, first cousins of ghouls, and closely conneoted with vampires
and churchyards, nor by the effeminate creations of a spasmodio,
Colney-Hatehney sentimentality, where all is Mystery, Melancholy,
and hopeless Muddle. Brightness, lightness, a pervading healthy
tone and truth to Nature, and somehow a feeling of English Some-
steadiness, seem to pervade the atmosphere of the New Galleries of
the Institute of Waterworks in Piooadillv.
Then came the opening ceremony on Friday night. We were all
in the Prince's Hall or Conoert Room—a gool place for sound, and
fitted up with the most perfect taste, except the baloony at the back,
which oin only be admired by those with whom open jim-tart is a
passion,—at the appointed time, and then punctually arrived Their
Royal Highnesses The Prince and Prinoess of Wales, delighted to
take part iu anything tending to promote the cause of Art, with
their distinguished party, whom all rose to receive as Mr. Arthur
Chappxix ushered them to their seats, with musical honours (be
hummed the accompaniment to the National Anthem in an under-
tone), performed by some respectable full-grown oherubs, of a serious
turn, packed up aloft,—they were members of the London Vooal
Union, and, this ceremony being over, the Harmonists in black and
white commenced a melodious invitation to somebody to " Strike the
Lyre," which challenge not being acoepted by anybody in particular,
the Respectable Warblers retired in excellent order, there being
dearly no Lyre present to be struck.
Then Mr. Fred Cowen played an accompaniment for Miss
Santlet, who sang a oouple of songs oharmingly and unaffectedly.
Then Signor Piatti played on his violonoello a Fantasia on airs from
Sonnambula, with Mr. Cowkn still at the piano, who, however, had
quite a little holiday of it when the Signor oame to the inevitable
variations. A simple tune has no ohance with Signor Piatti; he
won't let it alone. He hunts it into oorners: he moves up and down
stairs over it, dances on it, but up it oomes again fresh as ever, in
spite of his attempts to crush it. Then he has a game of pursuing
his bow with his left hand up and down the instrument, the bow
only narrowly escaping being caught each time and getting off with
a frightened squeak (like a mouse), when the left hand, evidently
very nervous, rushes up to the top of the instrument, souttling away
like a spider from a stinging fly, and doesn't venture down again for
at least another twenty seoonds or so. Finally the Signor is led off
exhausted by Mr. Cowen.
The absence of all water-colour from the programme was remark-
able, considering the occasion. We ought to have had " The JoUy
Young Waterman " in praise of the New Departure, " The Battle
of Trafalgar," "Hearts of Oak" by Mr. Santlei, and a fountain
or two might have been engaged to play. However, so it wasn't,
and on we went.
Madame Patet then' sang Schubert's "Ave Maria," giving a
version considerably at varianoe with the printed words in the pro-
gramme, so that, after the first four lines, those who were following
the book found it better to olose it at onoe, and listen to the singer,
which was a Teal treat. Then came a M. Vladimir de Pachmann,
who, in consequence of his long hair, and a bulkiuess about his
waist and coat-tails suggestive of concealed fish-bowls, to be presently
produced from under a handkerchief, I at first set down as a Con-
juror. He wasn't however, being a Pianist of considerable skill,
with an overpowering propensity for getting the most out of every
note, and listening in rapt admiration to its dying away in the
distance, and then slowly raising his left hand as if pronouncing a
blessing on the instrument as he went along, which I am bound to
say was by no means so rapidly as Borne of us would have wished.
However, he played himself out at last, didn't do the fish-bowls or
the eggs and cannon-ball in somebody's hat, and retired to make
way for Signor Foli, who burst upon us with a bravura, in which he
asserted that he " was a Roamer —which though a musical name,
is nowadays more associated with a Queen's Counsel than with
"four-eight" in a bar.
The Roamer having wandered away, the first part was brought to
a conclusion, the Stewards, with red rosettes, disappeared, and pre-
sently the Chappell of Ease returned, and begged their Royal High-
nesses to ascend to the Galleries, deolare the New Building open,
see the Pictures, take some refreshment, and enjoy themselves.
With whioh request their Royal Highnesses oom plied, and then pro-
ceeded to inspeot the Pictures. So did everybody else. Space will
not permit of our giving extracts just now from the Catalogue,
whioh, d la mode Parisienne, is illustrated, and is a most useful
souvenir of the visit. Sir Frkderick, P.R.A., kindly looked in just
to give a touch of Oil to the Waters, in case they should be troubled.
The opening of the New Picoadilly Waterworks was a brilliant
success, on which the Council of Ten, including the President, Mr.
Louis Haghe, the indefatigable Secretary, the Curator Everill
(may he be Always Well!), Mr. Linton, and the Members who have
Btuok manfully to the work, are to be heartily congratulated.

Second Lady. Weren't they! I saw Miss Ellen

I was told he was there.
Third Lady. I just caught a glimpse of him as he was

Second Lady. No 1 did yon? I wish I had. I've

{Turnedfrom "the Conventional" into "the Plain Truth.")
On Buch and suoh a date, to suit the convenience of the Chief
Performers, who are usually lazy Clerks in disorganised Government
Offices,
A GRAND EXHIBITION OF INCOMPETENCY
will be held, nominally for the Benefit of some obscure Charity, but
really
IN GLORIFICATION OF THEIR OWN SELF-CONCEIT,
admittedly by a band of "Amateur Actors" (Actors. Bave the mark!)
calling themselves by a high-sounding title, but really
By a Body of Fraudulent Donkeys,
who. by announcing that they oan " act" some popular piece, induce
the Public to pay their money to come and see them. The perform-
ances will commence with
THE BUNGLING OF A FARCE,
in which some brainless idiot, brimming over with mistaken eelf-
confidence will have the
Unbounded Impudence,
displayed in get-up, business, and other details picked up with the
assistance of a professional Coach, of

The Programme will end with a second attempt at damaging the
Dramatic Authors' Society, by
MURDERING A MODERN COMEDY.
This dark deed will be accomplished by a number of numskulls of
both sexes, with the OTgans of self-esteem and love of approbation
abnormally developed. The whole will conclude (as it has com-
menced) with a grand display of
Vanity, Frivolity, Jealousy, and All sorts of TJnchahitablbniss.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
MUSICAL NOTE.
We regret having been unable to assist
at Mr. Sims Reeves's Concert, last week.
Oar Musical Man went, and reported that
the Concert was a first-rate one, and that
Mr. Irvihg's song, accompanied by Mr. J.
L. Tools on the trombone, was the gem of
the entertainment. Mr. Santlf.y has never
been in better voice than at the Concert
—not Sims's, but another's—and he was
cheered to the echo, and by the Echo (there
is a very objectionable one in St. James's
Hall, and the Police, assisted by Mr. Ar-
thur Chappell, ought to find her out, and
bring her up with her sister at the Albert
Hall before the nearest Magistrate, charged
with disturbing the audience)—in his splen-

At which when it I hear,
I laugh " ha! ha!"

Some folk would be shocked
To see me f rocked

My tailor would sigh,

Pocket Books.—A propos of Royal Aoademy subjects, the most useful little books and
most appropriate presents just about this time are those forming the series of The Or tat
Artists, published by Messrs. Sampson Low—which always seems to suggest a gentle pub-
lisher's name, to be fitted to the air of " Soft and Low "—and, with this hint, he that hums
may hum it, and if he hums it wrong, he can comfort himself with the reflection that—
"To err in humming is a gift divine."
But to return to our books: they are excellent for reference, usefully illustrated, and adapted
to an ordinary pocket, being half-a-crown or three-and-six pence a-pieoe.

OUR ACADEMY GUIDE


"No. 1." Up a tree: taken
at last.
No. 28.—Catching a Mermaid; or, the
Judicious Hooker.
No. 37.—Une Grande Dame;
or, A Little Big-wig.
No. 58.—Gone Wrong.
(See deicription below.)

No. 163.—Private Frith's View.—Members of the Salvation Army, led by General Oscar Wilde, joining in a hymn.
Of course the Academy Exhibition must begin with the celebrated
"No. 1," as shown above.
No. 3. "Baby on the Sock." Arthur Stocks. Buyers recom-
mended to invest capital in the Stocks.
No. 5. "The Double Entendre." Evident situation: Old Gentle-
man has juat said something which brings a blush to the cheek of
"the Young Person." Fanoy what the cheek " of the old person
must be! Marcus Stonk, A. Not, perhaps, quite the gem of the
collection, but still a precious Stone.
No. 13. Memories. By Arthur Hughes. Treated above, so no
Hughes repeating it here.
No. 28. The Judicious Hooker. Vide supra.
No. 29. On entering Gallery No. L, the eye—anybody's eye—will
be immediately caught by Mr. M illais' Hook. It is without excep-
tion the finest picture in the entire Show. It is saying a great deal,
but all will agree that this is the picture of the year, and that a finer
portrait Mr. Mtllais has never painted. There is just one disap-
pointment in this picture: the nose is almost Grecian. Now, how-
ever exact the likeness in other respects, it must be dear to everyone
that Mr. Millais' brother Academician must have a Hook nose.
No. 30. Applet. By Mr. Macoreoor. We regret to say we
have to "crab" Applet.
No. 37. Une Orande Dame; or, A Little Big-wig. J. E. Mil-
lais, R.A. She can say " Pa " and "Ma," and should be labelled,
"A guinea, dressed and complete."
No. 58. Gone Wrong: or, a Mysterious Pottage in the Life of
Lady Jane Grey. J. E. Millais. The picture tells its own story.
Lady G hey was staying at a hostelrie, and returning late from an
evening party she forgot the number of her room, couldn't find the
candle, and lost her way in the corridor. The unfortunate Lady is
represented at a critical moment, when, afraid of meeting a stranger's
gaze, she shuts her eyes, so as not to confront the stairs.
No. 60. A Real Centenarian. E. A km it* ok, R.A. Intended as
a companion picture to a portrait of " Old Parr," to be called " Old
Ma'."
Nos. 91 and 97. Edwin Long, R.A. Twin Sisters. "Linked
sweetness,—Long drawn out." Go on—can't stop Long.
No. 87. Taking the Chair. Nervous elderly Gentleman, evidently
frightened at being in somebody else's seat, from which he will
Erobably be ejected. C. Grenville Manton. Couldn't have made
is mark more distinctly if he'd been a " Jo Manton."
We will return to Gallery No. I. another day. At present, on our
first visit, we must just skim the oream of the Show, and so, on
entering Gallery No. II., we walk straight np to—
No. 163. Mr. Frith'»_ Private View. The Artist is, of course, as
much entitled to his private view as is Mr. Braslaugh, or General
Booth, or as we are ourselves. Like Daniel in the celebrated
Newdigate poem—
And when we saw the picture on the wall,
At first we couldn't make it out at all.
But a few moments' reflection will help the spectator to the Artist's
meaning. It is clearly this : —A number of celebrities have joined the

testhetio Mr. Oscar Wilde, while Mr. Sala, having lof t his plaoe in
the book, is giving echoes in the background. Mr. Millais, only
half converted, feels uneasy, and is rubbing himself sideways against
the corner of a frame. Mr. Marks is anxiously waiting for the
hymn to be finished, in order to preach on his own conversion, and
point to himself as a Frightful Example. Mr. Henry Ikying looks
pale and nervous; he is probably about to yield to inspiration, and
to address them in the unknown tongues. The prominent members
are of course Generals, Captains, and Lieutenants, while "Private"
Yiew himself is modestly at the back taking notes.
The distinctive mark of this Corps of the Salvation Army is the
shape of their hats; they have all been compelled to observe unifor-
mity in this respeot, and have, no doubt, all dealt with the same
hatter. The President's, Sir F. Leighton's, clothes will give his
tailor fits. May the tailor do the same for Sir Frederick!
On the old system adopted by the stage-managers of the Elizabe-
than era, who called a spade a spade, and wrote up " This is a
House," This is a Tree," and so forth, Mr. Firth has most

siderately placed the names of the celebrities represented underneath,
so that, after the first ten minutes, there is no possibility of mistaking
Sir Fbedebicx for Mr. Ikying, Ellen Terby for Nelly Fab-
ken, Mr. Gladstone for Mr.
Tenniel, or Sir W. V. Harcoubt
for Mr. W. Agnew, M.P., and so
on. It will be a most valuable
picture long after the Salvation
Army craze is forgotten, and
most interesting when all pho-
tographs of the persons here
represented shall have faded
away, and their likenesses
everywhere been destroyed,—
excepting always those in Mr.
Punch'i unique collection, which
will ever exist to answer doubts,
decide bets, restore certainty,
and correctly teach history.
After this we have not time or
space for much. Just look at—

Naughty Corporation. Fie!

An old Subject frequently " Treated."
GOLDEN WORDS FROM A MAN OF METAL.
[From a MS. preserved in the Office of Works.)
The Chief Commissioner and the Secretary stood still and looked
at one another in wonder. It was just before daybreak and exactly
opposite Apsley House.
"Thank you again, Gentlemen," repeated the Bharp metallic voice.
"Where does it come from?" asked the Chief Commissioner, in a
frightened whisper.
From me," was the immediate'answer. "From F.M. the Duke
of Wellington."
"The strangest sight I have seen since I left the Legation in
Japan," murmured the Secretary, regarding the statue with awe.
A very good site, indeed," observed the Iron Duke, with a smile,
as he glanced around him at the new roads. "I am sure I have to
thank you both for the trouble yon have taken in getting me down.
When I make my acknowledgments, I must not forget Mr. R. J.
Callender, who, Wore he went to the Office of Works, did capital
service at the Admiralty and in Ceylon in positions of the greatest
responsibility."
The Assistant Seoretary is, and has been for many years simply
invaluable," said the Chief Commissioner.
"Hear,[hear !" heartily echoed Mitfobd, C.B.
"Quite so. And now that I have come to land safely, the sooner
I get to the Horse Guards the better."
You will find the place rather changed, your Grace," observed
the Chief Commissioner, who was now regaining his composure.
"No doubt," returned Wellington; "I know perfectly well that
Geobge—the other Duke—was marched off to Pall-Mali with head-
quarters' staff. It was a forced march, and George liked it no better
than he liked the anti-scarlet grey."
"Oh, you know about that controversy?" observed the Seoretary.
"My good friend. I know everything. From my elevated position
I have seen much, but, until you were kind enough to lower met I
had no opportunity of airing my opinions. A trifle too much air,
perhaps; but anything I might have said would have been over
the heads of the people. I was saying," continued the Iron
Duke, unbending a little, "although I saw a great deal up there, I
had no opportunity of getting at anybody until you let me down.
However, my experience has been serviceable. I have had this
advantage over other people in exalted positions—that I have been
allowed to see matters for myself. My view has been perfeotly dear
(except in a London fog), and I am able to give you good advice now
that I am standing beside you on a footing of equality."
"You are very kind," said the Chief Commissioner.
"I will address myself, if you please, more particularly to your
colleague," replied the Duke. To Mr. Mitfobd—to whom is
chiefly due the present alteration."
"No, no," interrupted the Companion of the Bath, modestly.
"But I say ' Yes, yes,' " replied the Great Commander; "and I
am not accustomed to make a statement without due consideration.
To yon, Sir, then, I address myself, and ask—You have moved me,
why don't you move t'other one?"
T'other one P " echoed the Secretary.
"Yes, t'other one. T'other one who now t'» as great a nuisance as
I was. Who hadn't the excuse that I had. Who can help being
the cause of an eyesore when I couldn't. In short the Duke of"
"Mtoforb !" cried the two officials, thrilling with horror.
"That is the person," said the Statue. "You have pulled me
down, pull him up. You are making room on my site for hosts of
flowers. Make room on Aw site for battalions of vegetables!"
"But surely, Duke, it would be slightly disrespectful," ventured
the Chief Commissioner, timidly, "to take a sight"
"No flippancy, Sir!" thundered the Iron Duke, who seemed to
regard Mr. Shaw Lefevbe as rather an interloper in the presence of
Mr. Mitfobd. "Why not go to Covent Garden and ask t'other one
to do something. Insist upon it, Sir; insist upon it. Make a clean
sweep of it—orange-peel, cabbage-stalks, market garden baskets,
slush, mud and all! Clear it out, Sir, clear it out! Nowadays
sentiment goes for nothing, and there is not muoh sentiment in that
neighbourhood. Pull down everything. Cause a market to be built
on a site bounded on the North by Long Acre, and on the 8outh by
the Strand. Carry it East to Drury Lane, and leave the West alone
—only on account of Sir Christopher and his barn. Then, Sir,
open the new building with an International Vegetable Exhibition.
Splendid advertisement, which should give the improved market a
grand start, and throw into the shade the fishy show at South Ken-
sington I Come, Gentlemen, do your duty! Down with Mudfohd
and his market! Up, Guards of London, and at them!"
The man of metal perfectly glowed with excitement.
"We will do our best," returned the Chief Commissioner. "And
now, your Grace, is there anything more we can do for you?"
"Well, yes," replied the Duke, gazing at the coming dawn. "I
must be brief with my remarks, as at daybreak I lose my voice.
You can do for me an act of justice. But first shake hands."
The officials respectfully clasped in turn the iron palm.
"Again I thank you. And now for my act of justice.^ When I
am placed in my final site opposite the Horse Guards—which I hope
will be soon?"
"It shall be soon," assented the Chief Commissioner.
"I should like to have another statue to balance me, as a vis-a-vis.
This should be a statue of one of the greatest Warriors of the age."
"To be sure," murmured Mr. Shaw Lefevre; '' Lord Wolseley ?''
"No, Sir, not Lord Wolseley. Not only is this hero a great
Warrior, but a great Judge, a great Artist, an eloquent Advocate."
"He must mean Sir Frederick Leighton," whispered Mitford,
C.B. "You know the P.R.A. commands a battalion of Volun-
teers."
"I do not mean Sir Frederick, who has yet to learn what to do
with a brush—with the enemy," replied the Iron Duke. "No,

The Statue at Large.
Gentlemen, the illustrious individual to whom I allude is a personal
friend of my own. It is to his exertions, extending over a long
series of years, that I owe my present position. He insisted that
I should be permitted to descend. He is the greatest man of this or
any other century. He is the hero of not a hundred but a thousand
fights."
The dawn began to break, and the voioe of the great Commander
grew faint.
"He is the grandest Roman of them all. Need I say that I
mean—I mean"
And then came daybreak, and the Duke was silent.
The two officials looked at one another, and repeated, "' The
neatest man of this or any other century.' Why, the Duke must
have meant" And they whispered the name of the most
renowned Sage the world has ever known. And they were right—
the Duke did mean Mr. Punch!
In last Saturday's P. M. Gazette there is an aocount of how, years
ago, Mr. Dion Bouctcat/lt wrote and produced a Passion Play, nim-
self playing Pontius Pilate, bedad, Sorr! This sounds as if the
Irish Dramatist had out-heroded Hfrodiade.

The Political Clocks are the wildest of all,
And to "synchronise" them is a task far too tall
For the Grandest Old Man or the Grandest New Club.
The Conservative Clock is too slow. But the rub
Is that Liberal Clocks will not go all together,
Two Thousand co-feeders may seem well in tether.
Bat just cast before them Contention's big bone,
And you '11 find that each dock keeps a time of its own.
Ah, me! the Great Orator's self must now know
The Conservative Clock's not the only one slow.
There are others a bit " behind time ;on that night
They seemed going together, and all going right,
But the next, at 1'30, St. Stephen's chime
Marked what he had rightly called " accurate time,"
Yet the Liberal Clocks who struck steady and true.
Stood at Two Eighty-Nine against Two Ninety-Two I
And the Orator, manfully bearing the shook,
Most have found a new meaning in—" Look at the Clock!"
A Foreigner visiting London for the first time, thought he was
doing the right thing in directing the Cabman to take him to Lin-
coln's Inn, as he meant to order a room at one of the " Inns of the
Court," which he presumed were hostelries patronised by Royalty.

Potiphar, without which, always on the fire, no French family
exists."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commont, Monday, April 30.—Think we know a
man when we've had him with us daily through three Sessions.
There's Randolph, for example. Anyone asked what sort of a man
he was, would probably answer, " Amusing, interesting, audaoious,
pert, bat shallow." That shows danger of hasty judgment. To-
night Randolph presented himself in new oharacter. Exceeded
Attorney-General in legal lore, Mr. Gladstone in philosophical
research, and Mr. Beresford Hope in ecclesiastical knowledge.
Late Lord Macaulay nothing to him for world-wide erudition.
Showed himself intimately acquainted with all Fathers known to
scholars, and one over. This was Orf-gen.
"Thought I knew 'em all," the Premier murmured, fixing
admiring gaze on youth opposite; "but who is this 'i Unearthed
him from some ory-ginal source. Must look him up."
Randolph's triumph eclipsed, later, by that of Joseph Gillib,
equally remarkable in its way. At midnight proposed to adjourn
debate on Affirmation Bill. Conservatives objected. This makes
refreshing change. Ordinary custom is to objeot to prolongation of
Adjournment when Government want to go on for another hour or
so. Now, under necessity of proceeding with Customs Bill, Minis-
ters agree to adjourn early. J. B. asleep when fun commences.
Generally gets an hour or two's snooze about this time. "The
question is, that debate be now adjourned." _ The Conservatives,
having had their little fling, desist from Opposition. Then Joseph
comes to the front, and takes natural position of Leader. Shouts
out, "No!" Friends and countrymen near him attempt to stop
him. Shake him, punch him in the ribs, shout expostulation in his
ear. Bat Joseph only the more loudly cries " No!"
Sir Arthur Otway thinks in circumstances he may deolare
Adjournment carried, and does so, simultaneously vanishing from
Speaker's chair, where he has sat in the absence of Sir Henry
Brand. Then storm bursts forth. Deputy-Speaker evidently made
a mistake. Joseph Gii.t.is radiant, Arthur O'Connor argumenta-
tive, Mr. O'Donnell saroastic. Irishmen insist upon Sir Arthur
Otway coming back, and doing penanoe. Either that or his head
on a charger. After long wrangling, first alternative accepted,
Deputy-Chairman explains mistake, expresses regret, and Joseph
Gillis soothed and triumphant, the more so as by this time it is too
late to do any business.
Business done.—None.
Tuesday.—" I have been in this House, man and boy, for forty
years, Toby," Mr. Newdioate said to me in the Library just now,
where I found him looking up Lucretius; "and, though I say it
what shouldn't, I have the satisfaction of knowing that I ve opposed
most things that are now a part of the daily life of our constitu-
tional system. One thing I have noticed is, that whenever a
distinguished Member makes Latin quotations, there is for next
fortnight or three weeks a run upon the Latin poets. Greek's
different. There's only Gladstone, and was Lows, who could
manage that. But if it's a Latin tag, we 're sure to have a shower
of them. Faot is, I was just looking up one myself."
This prophecy from Our Own Jeremiah abundantly verified.
Young Dawnay dawned upon the House this evening with quite a
collection of Latin exercises, more or less well done. Mr. O'Don-
nell inspired new feeling of respect in bosom of Joseph Gillis by
trotting out a couple of lines. But the great success of the evening
was Dr. Lyons. This eminent person, who combines prescription
for the State with advice to private patients, bestowed much care
upon oration.
"You needn't mention it, Toby," he said to me (and of course I
won't), "but I've spent three hours among old prescriptions
looking up a few lines suitable for occasion. Rather think I shall
fetch the House."
Unfortunately, no House to fetch. Members properly horrified
at suggestion of curtailing the debate, but they won't remain to
hear it. Only five Members present when the Lyons' oration
delivered. Fine effect. The extracts from the prescriptions judi-
oiously. dropped in here and there. But plum saved for the last,
and sympathetic oheers came from the five Members as Dr. Lyons,
with outstretched hand and voice tremulous with emotion, declaimed
these magnificent lines—
"Magna est vis consuetudinis! Naturam expellas
Furca., tamen usque recurret. Labor omnia vincit,
Et liters scripta manet. In totidem verbis—
Lex loci; lex scripta; lex t alio ids; lex terra I"
Pity Gladstone not present to hear this. Been away most part
of night, like ordinary people. Towards midnight, having spent a
cheerful evening, Drummond Wolff oame in. Very angry to find
Ministers absent.
"They ought," he says, invoice that made Deputy Chairman
tremble, "to be in their places to hear the arguments of Honour-
able Members."
Feeble laugh from Radicals below Gangway. But probably no
laughing matter. Drummond means to look up precedents, and see
if he can't impeach Ministers on this indiotment.
Easiness done.—None.
Wednesday.—House of Commons continues to be model of busi-
ness assembly. On Monday night debate on Affirmation Bill stopped
at twelve o'olock in order to make progress with Customs Bill and
other Orders. From twelve till two ocoupied in considering whether
Bill should or should not be considered. At two o'clock thought it
time to go home, and went. To-day, House should have met at
twelve. Forty Members not forthcoming till ten minutes past one.
Then Motion made that Committees sit to-morrow at two instead
of twelve. Argument thereupon, and division, which took up an
hour.
Shall get on nicely at this rate. Mr. Bright says, in his
pleasant way, it's all the Conservatives. "Set of men, Toby," says
he, "who profess to worship God, and desire to worry the Govern-
ment."
Business done.—London Parochial Charities Bill read a Second
Time, and referred to Select Committee on distinct understanding
that there shall be no hurry about considering it.
Friday, 2 a.m.—Met Lord Henry Lennox crossing Lobby after
Division, holding right hand out as if it didn't belong to him, and
was carrying it off to drop it over the Terrace into the river, or in
other sate place.
"What's the matter, my dear Henry ?. Cut your finger?"
"No demmit," said Lord Henry, looking at offending member
with comicalest expression. "It's that fellow Callan, donoha.
Happened to be standing near him at Bar when figures announced.
Most extro'nary man. First of all jumped up into air as if dyna-
mite had exploded in unintended quarter, then seized hold of me,
and insisted upon shaking hands. Not pleasant, donoha, especially
as didn't happen to have a glove on. Shall be more careful in
future. Always wear gloves when any chance of Government being
defeated with help of Irish vote. Never know what '11 happen. Ta,
Ta! Just going over to lavatory, donoha. Suppose it isn't closed
yet?"
And Lord Henry still holding out his hand as if he'd picked it up
somewhere, and wasn't quite sure it wouldn't go off, ambled off.
Glad this Debate is finished on any terms. Been deadly dull, but
flare-up in last moments made up for fortnight of depression.
Biggest House in my time, and maddest. Kensington in first. Been
telling in Ministerial Lobby. Plain to see from his faoe that
Government had lost.
"Whoever scores three hundred will win," Richard Power said
before dinner/and I find no man who takes sounder view of chances
than Richard. Resigned office of Whip fortnight ago, but is himself
again to-night in prospeot of big Division.
Tellers from other lobby still tarried. Every minute should mean
half-a-dozen votes, and for nearly three minutes Mr. Milman stand-
ing at the end of table with figures of the Opposition waiting for
night or Lord Richard Grosvenor. The last arrived first, handed
in his cheoks, and bore away slowly to the right. Then the Con-
servatives and the Irish knew they'd won. Fell on eaoh other's
necks; bellowed in eaoh other's ears; waved hats and handker-
chiefs; and seemed on the whole gone mad. It waB then Mr. Callan
leaped into the air, and coming safely down, insisted upon shaking
hands with Lord Henry Lennox, whose responsive smile was some-
thing memorable.
Business done.—Affirmation Bill thrown out by 292 votes against
289.
Friday Night.—Never saw Sergeant-at-Arms in suoh low spirits.
Generally the oheeriest of men. To-night, met him walking slowly
off to dinner.
"Nice state of things this, Toby, dear boy," he said, in hollow
tones. "Here's Bbadlaugh comes np, stops at the Bar, delivers a
speeoh, walks away quietly, no hands across, and np the middle to
the Mace. No struggle on the floor of the House, no battering of
hats, tearing of coats, and breakage of stylographic pens. No more
good old times. Don't care how soon I go now, if things are to be
sneaked through in this way;" and, with a profound sigh, that onoe
Gay Old Warrior marohed on.
Business done.—Mi. Bradlaugh provided with splendid oppor-
tunity of advertising himself and his works.
Poor Brother Brush! His picture was hung right away up at the
top. On Varnishing Day he thought it had varnished entirely. But,
having mounted the loftiest ladder in the room, he found it, and
began tenoning it up. He said that the "ile" he used on tnw
occasion was the "ile of Skye."

not be a party to the slaughter

THE NIGHT OF WATERLOO (PLACE).
(Extract from " Childe Mather's Pilgrimage.")
*•••••
These is a sound of devilry by night.
And England's capital has gathered then
Her weakness and her wantonness, and bright
The lamps shine o'er rouged women and pale men;
A thousand hearts beat feverishly, and when
There saunters by the slim stiff-collar'd " Swell,"
Hard eyes look venal love on him whose brain
Is dry and void as an old walnut-shell.
But hush! hark! a big boom sounds like a sudden knell.
Did you not hear it? No, 'twas but the wind,
Or the swift Hansom rattling down the street.
On with the orgie! Late? Oh, never mind.
"We won't go home till morning." Life is fleet,
And happy rhymes with " Chappie." Ah, that's neat!
But hark I that booming sound breaks in once more,
And the colossal " ohuokers-out" repeat
"All out 1 aU out!" and point towards the door.
All out I Twelve-thirty. Yes. By Jove, a beastly bore!
And there is aimless rambling to and fro,
And satyr laughter, harpy eagerness;
And cheeks are cool which one short year before
Had blushed at sight of loud lasciviousnees.
And there are sudden whispers in the press,
Sinister signs, and laughing low replies
Which may not be repeated; all may guess
The evil meaning of those mutual eyes.
Upon so curst a night what hideous morn shall rise f
And there is mounting in hot haste, the steed,
The obsequious driver, and the " two-wheel-ar"
Go clattering westward, with impetuous speed;
And cads half-drunken close in wordy war,
And the deep-throated. "Peeler" sends afar
His " Pass along, please!" and the hiss and hum
Die slowly out, till the last Swell's cigar
Trails off, and home to den in square or slum.
Low cursing through red lips, slink Babylon's Rahab
Authority looks on, and calmly leaves
The open orgie, the nocturnal mass
Of flaunted profligacy. Vivien weaves
Her spells right well or Merlin is—an ass;
Bull the most patient ox that e'er munched grass.
Such shameless scenes what other cities show r
Would Dogberry and Verge* have let pass
Such saturnalia of the social foe,
Whose breath so many hopes hath blasted and laid low f
Senob Saba sate, the violinist, has been a brilliant success-
thanks to his relations with his musical Carina— the Eng-
lish Cusins, not Curias German. At first great interest was
aroused from the pronunciation of the name. People _ heard that
Saba Sabtt was going to play the violin, and got their ideas mixed
up on the subject, confusing Saba Bernhardt and Carlyle's Sartor
Resartus, which last, for aught most of them knew, might have
an oratorio, a fiddler, or the Latin for Hashed Yemson.
When does a Musician go in for a game of chance ?—When he

A HANDBOOK OF KNOWLEDGE.
No. X.—The Hairdresser.
Q. "What is a Hairdresser?
A. A compendious proof of the imperfeotion of Nature and of the
inadequacy of Art.
Q. Is not that answer more oracular than intelligible?
A. Possibly. A reply at onoe dear and concise cannot, in the
nature of things, be given. The subject is one to be approached
rather by description than by definition; to be dealt with, like a
heavy dinner or a large army, rather in detail than en bloc.
Q. Why, then, do you consider Hairdressers to be evidence of the
imperfection of Nature?
A. Were Nature, in the human sphere, perfect, our hair would
not require cutting any more than the ooat of a dog. On the other
hand, were Art equal to supplying the deficiencies of Nature, it
would long since have devised some means of divesting us of our
superfluous hirsute growth other than that ordeal of hideously
unpleasant processes suggested by the very name of Hairdresser.
Q. Is there not some exaggeration here?
A. The tortures of tonsure are incapable of exaggeration.
Q. Perhaps you will proceed to justify these sweeping assertions a
little in detail.
A. The processes of the Hairdresser's art are, from beginning to
end, necessarily destructive of those two things which alone render
life endurable.
Q. What are these P
A. First, the feeling of Comfort; secondly, the sense of Dignity.
The profoundly sensible ideal "otium cum dignitate" is abso-
lutely incompatible with the actuality of being shaven or shorn—at
least as men from time immemorial have submitted to be shorn or
shaven.
Q. How is this?
A. The sense of dignity departs from the victim on the very
threshold of the Hairdresser's entry. Human courage—nay, even
that far stronger thing, human assurance in its highest flight—is not
equal to the task of walking into a Hairdresser's " saloon " with the
calm and unfeigned confidence with which a man may— for example
approach a battery, or pass throngh a peBt-house.
Q. Why should thiB be bo?
A. The sense of impending humiliation is so strong upon him. It
springs into birth at the first disquieting thought "My hair wants
cutting I" It doubles in foroe when—after long delav—he is forced
to the conviction, "I must have my hair cut! It is at its crisis
when, with furtive slink or self-betraying swaggtr, he enters the
tonsorial torture-chamber. After crossing that Rubicon of ignominy,
it continues, but it cannot increase. It is perhaps even lessened by
the dull callousness that comes of self-surrender to shame.
Q. How is thiB sense of humiliation engendered?
A. By experience of two things:—
1. The character of the Hairdresser.
2. The nature of the professional " processes."
Q. What are the characteristics of the Hairdresser?
A. Those naturally produced in a man who has your personal
comfort and dignity at his mercy, and your ear, as a channel to your
pocket, absolutely at his command.
Q. Absolutely, did you say P
A. Practically so. You may leave a theatre, or even, in emer-
gency a church. You may tear yourself away from a button-holding
bore, or a nagging woman. But you cannot escape from a barber's
chair. Onoe seated and swathed therein, once snipped by shears or
scraped by blade, you are committed to endurance of all the personal
indignities, and all the mental tortures that the most blandly im-
pertinent, ignorantly loquacious, and intrusively " pushing " Hair-
dresser can inflict. And these are many and sore.

BESEARCH WITH HUMANITY.
"What could the excellent Earl of Shaftesbury, speaking ex
cathedra at the last Anti-Vivisection Meeting, have meant when he
told his hearers that "they did not find in the Bible any authority
whatever for that hideous curiosity which prevailed so widely in
Germany, and, he believed, to a very great extent in this country ";
and what did they understand the noble and venerable Earl to mean
when they received that declaration with shouts of " hear I hear!"?
They could hardly have wanted to be told that the Bible contains no
authority for any curiosity at all, as such, to say nothing about
curiosity of a hideous nature. What sort of curiosity is it that good
Lord Shaftesbury detests so extremely that he calls it hideous'f Is
it the sort of curiosity which prompted John Hunter to make those
experiments and observations that led to so many improvements and
advanoes not only in Anatomy and Physiology but in practical
Surgery; the curiosity which likewise moved Sir Charles Bell to
investigate the nervous system, and, for example, to discover the
distinot origins and connections of the sensory and motor nerves? Is
the curiosity of wanting to know the secrets of animal life, with a
view to the promotion of medical and surgical practice, "hideous"
in the sight of a Nobleman who, celebrated as a friend of his species,
may be presumed to be a friend of his own species first, and the
lower creatures afterwards f
Somebody tell the Earl of Shaftesbury, as to Sir Charles Bell's
great discovery respecting the nerves, that it "required an extensive
series of experiments on living animals which long deterred him
from carrying them into execution." This, however, he was at
length enabled to do through having invented "humane methods of
procedure," for the gratification of a curiosity which purely no one
but someone with such a very fixed idea, or fad, as Vivisection on
the Brain can possibly account hideous.
Given humane methods of procedure, and is scientific Viviseotion
any more oruel than Viviseotion as practised in killing a pig? We
do, as a nation, kill a good many pigs daily; but the Doctors may
really say:—" "We don't kill a guinea-pig every day; or, if we do,
we kill him by a comparatively very humane method of procedure."

do a great work; but its establishment at once directs public attention to a
supplementary and scarcely lets pressing need, and that is the foundation of

A Public Street in the neighbourhood of the Royal College of Mutic.
Enter Victorious Composition Scholarship Candidate, accompa-
nied by Fond Parent and enthusiastic Friends.
Fund Parent {embracing him). Heaven be praised, my dear boy,
for this successful issue! Strange that a Bathing-Machine Driver"s
child should suddenly have lighted on such a glorious future 1
Victorious Candidate. It is, my good father, most strange. But,
thanks to your discrimination, and to your noticing the peculiar fact
that, even at the tender age of three, 1 could pick out one of Bach's
fugues on the kitchen tumblers with a coal-hammer, I was despatched
in good time to this glorious Institution, where now £150 per annum,
board, lodging, a suit of clothes, and instruction, stimulate my
genius, and make me worthy to bear the promising name of Waonkr
Donizetti Smith with which you, in my infancy, so judiciously
and appropriately christened me.
Fund Parent. True, my clever modern Orpheus! However, now
you may indeed, as you say, be worthy of your modest name. And
I shall live to see not only your first but your twentieth Opera take
this vast Metropolis literally by storm.
Enthusiastic Friends. And so Bhall we! Heaven bless you 1 Only
send us plenty of paper for the Upper Boxes, and we will rally to
support you, we promise you, right neartily. Three cheers for the
College and for the triumphant genius it is about to foster. Hip!
hip I hip 1 hurrah!
[They chair the Successful Candidate, making way for five-and-
forty others, equally successful, who also emerge in triumph
from the College as the Act-drop falls.
ACT II.
An interval of seventy-five years is supposed to have elapsed
since Act I.
The Scene represents the Interior of a Police-Court. As the Act-
drop rises, an Aged Offender is helped into the Dock.
Magistrate {angrily). What! here again 1 And on the old
charge, I suppose, Mr.—what's your name?
Aged Offender {breaking down). Smith, your "Worship! "Wagner
Donizetti Smith.
Chief Clerk. The usual thing—begging. He has been up over and
over again. And he's not the only one. We have had twenty-seven
of them this last week.
Magistrate. Yes, I know the nuisance is getting intolerable:
and 1 must make an example. Fortunately, the "Indigent Com-
posers Act," passed last Session, enables me to do it with effect.
[Refers to it.
Aged Offender {in tears). Have pity. Sir, on a poor, worn-out,
deluded, disappointed, despairing old Musician. I didn't mean any
harm—indeed, I didn't. I was only trying to sell a few of these
about the streets, and singing some of my own scenas to help 'em off.
{Produces nineteen original English operas, with orchestra scores
complete.) But nobody will have 'em!
Magistrate {irritated). Certainly not, Sir. Who do you think is
going to take an English opera when there's no house at which to
produce it? You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Sir, at your time
of life, for writing them.
Aged Offender. At my time of life! "Why, I'm only two-and-
ninety. 1 may still have my chance !—still have my chance!
The Clerk. That 'a what they all say. The College turns out a
lot of them, every blessed year, able to do nothing else—but music;
and as there's nothing but the Chinese Opera House on the Em-
bankment for them, they 're no good; so they wander about in
shoals and starve. Why, there were three hundred of 'em carted
off by the Emigration Commissioners only last month.
Magistrate. WelL It is a very bad case. Keally the College
oughtn't to do this. However, Society must be protected. Sue
months.
Aged Offender. Thank your Worship. Thank you. Bnt it
isn't the fault of the College. And many years ago there was one
praiseworthy effort, I know, to help us. But if the Government or
somebody had only started a proper National Opera in the heart
of London on a sound and permanent basis, an English dramatic
composer need never have come to this. No, he never need.
Magistrate {more kindly). Very likely not. But, as I said just
now, Sooiety must be protected. And now, I '11 take the next case.
[Aged Offender is removed, to be brought up again on a similar
charge that day six months as Curtain falls.

Following the example set by some of our contem-
poraries last week, we hasten in their own Btyle to give
the interesting historical particulars of the latest Knights
on record:—
Mr. George Grove. D.C.L.. was born at a place com-
monly known as Clapham. He constructed the Chester
and Holyhead Railway with the assistance of Mr.
Stephfjison, directed the entertainments at the Crystal
Palace, hence his degree of D.C.L.—" L." standing
for Palace,—wrote a dictionary of Musicians from
A to Z, and while exploring Palestine and inventing
the soup which still bears that name, he occupied his
leisure in editing Macmillan'i Magazine and revising
the Old Testament. He sings three songs in excellent
style, and, in order to encourage him to add to their
number, he has been made President of the Royal CoUege
of Music, where his various crotohets will come in usefully,
and is now Sir Geobge Grove the Good Knight.
Mr. George Alexander Macfarren, chosen for the
honour of Knighthood, selected London for the place of
his birth, and was reared on Macfarrenacious food. He
was eduoated at the Royal Academy of Music, has oom-
tmsed much excellent work. He may prefer to be a
Knight Out.
Dr. Arthub Sullivan (according to the D. T.) was
not born at all to begin with, but returned to England
about nineteen years after. He has written the oratorios
of box and Cox, Trial by Jury, Patience, Pinafore, &c,
but it is with compositions of a loftier charaoter that
his name will be linked. He played Poker with the Vice-
Chancellor of Cambridge, and composed The Silver
Trumpington Street March, for which he was made D.C.L.
and M.D. His hymn to the Trustees of the Doughty
Estates, commencing "If Doughty Deeds," was highly
popular with the "Gentlemen of the long robe" who
used to sing it as a catch, three in a (Chancery) Bar. He
is still a Bachelor of Music, though wedded to his Art.
Rise, Sir Arthur 1

OPENING OF THE NEW FISH-MA.RKET.
I thought how much the old Corporation was in ernest in pretending to build a new Fish
Market in Smith field in oppersition to blooming Billingsgate. As I said to Jim, the
Whiteohapel Coster, was it likely as they would go for to oppose their own old Tennants
who was a-paying on 'em threepence a foot a week, in order to support a lot of new 'una
who was only to pay tuppence? Why, of course the thing was absurd, and I quite agrees
with the Lord M a you that nobody but a stupid could believe it, so I spose as he saw
through it from the beginning. But I did think as they'd have done a little summat more
than they did, just to set the pot a-boiling, if they didn't mean to keep it going for long.
But lor bless ns, it was just a lark I About eleven o'clock in drives the Lord Mayor in his
Coach and 4 and the 2 Shereffs with him, and one Under Shereff, as a Policeman told me,
tho' they all looked much alike, except as the Under-un had the biggest Coach, with
2 policemen and the City Field Marshall in front of him, and with the 2 swells in the Coach
with him to carry his sword and his septer, and there he finds a lot of common oounsellers
all a-waiting for him to open the New Fish Market, whioh had been opened ever since
4 o'olock 1 And how many shops full of fish and how many stands full of fish did he find
there? Why, of course I hardly expects
to be beleeved, but 1 'm gormed if there
was more than six of one and half-a-dozen
of the other.
I think as I 'ye heard that at dirty,
scrowged, swearing and tearing, but yet
jolly old Billingsgate, that we generally
gets between four and five hundred tons of
fish a day. Well, I think I can give about
as good a guess at the weight of a lot of
fish as many people, and if there was a
nounce more than Five Tons, blowed if I
wouldn't bind myself to live on fish for a
whole week, tho' it's a article of food as
I don't much patronise, preferring chops
and steaks and such like.
The poor Lord Mayor looked I thought
rather ashamed of the whole affair. He
didn't say muoh, how could he after he had
called all the Committee a lot of stupids,
and they all looked grumpy and down in
the mouth, and all got away as quick as
they could, not one of 'em as I believe even
so muoh as buying a bit of fish just to give
the new Market a bit of a start. There was
several of our jolly old Billingsgate boys
a grinning away like mad to see what a
reglar Sham the whole thing was. Old
Jack Bennett, as we calls him, was there
of course, he's always everywhere I'm told
wherever two or three hundred people are
gathered together. My friend the Polioe-
man told me as he lost a beautiful gold
watch last week at some meeting, while he
was ohatting with the Archbishop of Can-
terbury, and that he has offered 20 Guineas
reward for it, and Bobby added with a grin
as it would be about the best advertisement
as he had ever sent out. Of course 1 don't
know what he means.
Well, presently the Lord Mayor and
the Sheriffs and the Under Sheriff and the
Common Councillors they all stands in a
row and Sir John Bennett he goes and
puts himself right in front of 'em all, and
sure enough they was all photograffed and
then away they all went.
Bnt lor to think of the difference of what
it was when they opened blooming Billings-
gate after rebuilding it some few years
ago I There wasn't even a flag or a band of
music or a blue silk Common Counsellor
there on Thursday, and if it hadn't been
for jolly Sir John who was all over the
place, there wouldn't have been a single bit
of fun in the whole dreary business.
Ah! I alwayB said as they'd find our
Billingsgate boys rather a hard nut to
crack. "They've got the Men, they've
got the Fish, they've got the Money too!"
Our only fear is that the public are not
quite such fools as some people think
they are; and if once they find that they
can come to this nioe, clean, tidy-looking
Market, without getting all their clothes
spoilt, and without hearing any of our very
powerful, bnt rather fishy language, and
without being shoved about all over the
plaoe, and oan buy their fish pretty rea-
sonable, praps things won't be quite so
comfortable like as they have been for many
years past for the Billingsgate Salesmen,
the Billingsgate Bummaree, or for snoh as
me and my palls. j0E Muggins.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

FEDORA ON THE "TAPPY."
A Bernhabdt-Beere ob Half-and-Half Chronicle.
M. Sardou's Fedora, carefully transferred from French to English
by Mr. Hermann Mem vale, has been produced, as all the London
Theatre-goin g world knows, at the Haymarket Theatre. Mr. and Mrs.
Bancroft, haying confidence in the Victorious Sabdou, purchased
the aoting-right of Fedora, and had then to discover an English
equivalent for Sara Bernhardt, Fedora'> original representative, for
whom, and for whose eccentric idiosyncrasies the part was written
The Haymarket Management pitched on Mrs. Bernard Beere for
their Fedora, and we are bound to say that, judging from her first
night's performance, this Lady has thoroughly justified the confidence
Slaced in her by the Banorof ters, who in the
rst instance may have selected her on account
of a certain vague facial resemblance to Sara,
mainly due to the touzled lashion of hair, so
that they may be said to have been taken by
that refreshing mug of Beere.
Fedora is a translatable, hut unadaptable
play, for Fedora adapted would cease to be the
Fedora created by Sardou, and vivified by
Saba_ Bernhardt, in whose hands Sabdou's
creation became a living, moving—very moving
—oreature,_ endowed with all the Sara-Bern -
hardtian gifts, graces, tricks, and manners.
"Whether Fedora had to be transferred to the
American, English, Dutch, or German Stage, it
Beere drawn with a was absolutely necessary, in order to insure
Head. the same success already achieved at Paris,
to procure an Aotress who was willing to
allow herself to be prepared, as is the photographer's plate, to
receive an exact impression, and reproduce a true portrait of the
great original. An Aotress so constituted was found in Mrs.
Bernard Beere, henceforward to be known as Mrs. Sara-Bern-
hardt-Beere, who, as Sara cannot learn sufficient English to play
Fedora herself in London, becomes her substitute at the Haymarket,
where we had the pleasure of applauding every pint of Beere, and
"chalaking " it up to her account.
Those who have never seen Sara will probably be quite satisfied
with the excellent imitation which Mrs. Saba-Bebnhardt-Bbrre,
by close study, thorough appreciation, and earnest work has been
able to give. Appearance, to a certain extent, is in her favour:
voice, style, and want of experience are against her. Had we our-
selves never seen Saba's performance in this or in anything at all,
we fancy we should have recognised in Mrs. S. B. Beere's rendering
of Fedora a struggle between Nature and Art, whioh had resulted
in a temporary compromise. A deep-toned masculine voioe is not
"an excellent thing in woman," and inability to modulate it or to
infuse into it the true tone of pathos, must produce a monotonous
effect; while perpetual restlessness, unreasonable and inexplicable
changes of attitude (for which the audience has not been prepared by
any description of the Princess Fedora's characteristics previous
to the Second Act) weary the spectator, and distract his attention
from whatever the real serious interest of the situation may be at the
moment. Saba can do all
this perfectly: like the
dogs that delight to
bark and bite," it is "her
nature to." But though
Beer is associated with
hops, Mrs. Beebe is not at
home in Bkips and jumps,
whioh seem rather the re-
sult of unoiled mechanism
than of natural impulse.
Were we seeing Mrs.
Saba-Bebnhardt-Beebe
for the first time in our lives when she was playing Fedora, we should
have said this Lady is fashioned by Nature to be an exceptionally
powerful Lady Macbeth: she is masculine, commanding, deep-toned,
tall, hard; she has not any of the tenderness occasionally evinced in
the purring manner of the feline Fedora, but she has all the charac-
teristics of the Thane of Cawdor's wife.
Revenge is the key-note of the play, which is unrelieved by any
display of passionate love, or strong motive of generous self-sacrifice.
There is in it no honest, wholesome love-interest; for though Loris
and Fedora become lovers, yet, as presented by Mrs. Sara Bkhn-
hakdt-Beere, and Mr. Coohlan, we may well exclaim, sure such a
pair were never seen so totally unfit to meet by Nature, except
they come together for a jolly good row.
Lorit, as played, or walked through, by Mr. Coohlan, on the
first night—(he has "not been the same man since," but has
considerably improved the performance) — appeared to be rather
bored, and, we own, very naturally so, by the gushing Russian

Act IY. Beere rather Flat.

Army Evolutions (Mrs. 11.) and Reserved Force
(vlr. C. Coghlan).
Lady who so flops, and falls, and bumps, and bounoes, and clings,
and pulls, and hauls; and who, regardless of the proper uses oi
furniture, perches
herself on the sofa-
back, tucks herself
up on a chair, and
is so badly brought
up—(she is a Prin-
cess, don't you
know, poor thing!)
—as to be perpetu-
al! y putting her
elbows on the
table, and appa-
rently sitting on
one leg and show-
ing one foot, that
we wonder poor
bewildered, quiet
Lorit does not ex-
claim, "My dear
creature, do sit
still for one min-
ute I Do remem-
ber that you are
not the diapha-
nous, lithe, eleotrio
belle, Sara, and it doesn't suit you, you know—it really doesn't!"
Though Mr. Coohlan is worth two of Pierre Berton, yet, as
Fedora's lover, who has to make it, as Mr. John Clayton would say,
"All for her," a copy of Pierre Berton was really required as a
companion picture to the copy of Sarah Bernhardt.
Now, take Mrs. Bancroft as Countess Olga. Was it possible for
this inimitable Actress to be anything but original? Her originality
is herself; and she would have refused point blank to copy the
French Actress who was the lively original of Countess Olga. She
plays, as she dresses the part, in a wonderful
manner, and is an amusing but really use-
less personage.
Again, Mr. Ban-
croft did not
thinkit necessary
to reproduce the
individualities of
the Fienoh Actor
who played Jean
de Sxriex, Fedo-
ra's confidential
friend and chorus,
but quite unre-
cognisable in his
wonderful' make-
up,' he seemed to
be somebody else
giving a olever
imitation of Mr.
Bancroft.
Miss Julia
G Wynne, late of
the Electrio Sa-
voy Light-headed
Corps, shone as
Dmitri, the pic-
turesque Page-boy, or Russian Buttons.
Mr. Brooefield seemed to be speaking excellent Russian as the
Comio Detective Gretch, whose appearance would attract a crowd of
little boys in any thoroughfare ; Mr. Fitzpatrick—bedad, Sorr—was
quite at home as a guest, and Mr. Shedley as M. Rouvel appeared
as a Haymarket^ old-stager, playing with ease and elegance. The
?ieoe altogether is placed on the stage in suoh a style as leaves the
arisian mise-en-scene nowhere. It has been a plucky venture on
the part of Jean db Siriex Bankroff to invest in Russians; no
expense, trouble, or pains has been spared; and as a great curiosity
has been aroused by its Parisian reputation, all London will go and
see it; and that will be a good enough result for some time to come.
As forjthe play itself, the First Act is a long way the best, depending
on the melodramatic interest of the situations and the general excel-
lence of the ensemble. Here too Mrs. Beere is at her best when she
exclaims, "Take him then, you are bound to do so!" There is not
another line in the piece suite her so well as this. The plot will not
bear ten minutes' calm consideration: probability has been recklessly
sacrificed to the necessity of inventing situations for Saka Bernhardt.
The situations, consequently, are effeotive, the piece ineffective.

Countess Olga (Mrs. .Ban-
croft), a most engaging
person.

THE COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER ON THE NILE.
Mr dear Tewfik,
I have now the pleasure of forwarding you my General
Report on the present condition and future prospects of Egypt. I
might have communicated it to you, accompanied simply by one of
those Official Despatches, of which I f anoy you have received a good
many sinoe my arrival in the country. Our friendly intimaoy,
however, enables me to address you through the medium of a private
letter, which has the great advantage of not actually binding Her
Majesty's Government to the views expressed in it, while if every-
thing turns out satisfactorily, they can then claim the full credit
of the policy which I am about to expound.
I cannot, of course, expect that your Highness will endorse every
sentiment in my Report; but as I have no desire to be held personally
responsible for all the recommendations which it contains, I am
anxious that people should think that the projected reforms men-
tioned in it are exclusively the outcome of your own generous and
enlightened nature, although I dare say that many of them will
occasion you and Chbrif Pasha just a little surprise I
It is, of course, a source of deep regret to me that I should be
obliged to run off to Constantinople, and spend a week or so in
London en route, instead of remaining to witness the intense grati-
tude of the Egyptian "Fellaheen" for the unexampled blessings
whioh they now enjoy, which include the payment of the Bond-
holders and of an indemnity of somewhere about a million sterling.
I confidently anticipate that in a short time your Highness will
be enabled to drive through the streets without muoh fear of instant
assassination.
Already I have to congratulate you on the progress which has been
made. It is true that gross official corruption, the misuse of arbi-
trary power, and a thousand injustices prevail. What of that?
Your Highness must have noticed befort now, the cheering faot that
this is the best of all possible worlds, and that everything is for the
best in it. The material tranquillity of tfie country is absolute from
one end to the other, if we except the rather dangerous tumults
which have recently ooourred at Port Said, the consequent excite-
ment at Cairo, and the open rebellion of the False Prephet in the
Soudan. This tranquillity is entirely due to your Highness's benefi-
cent measures, and not in the smallest degree to the presence of a
British garrison capable of crushing a revolt at its very outset.
As for those Fellaheen, who are still inconsiderate enough to com-
plain of oppression, the knowledge that the use of the " kourbash"
has been declared illegal, should surely console them for any actual
Hoggings they may have undergone. Should they still have the
bad taste to continue oomplaining, then I feel convinced that the
announcement that in a few weeks the elaboration of a New Civil
and Criminal Code will be completed, ought to draw tears of heartfelt
joy and penitence from their eyes.
Tour Highness's generous bestowal of free and Representative
Institutions is just what I should have exported, considering the
very strong hints I have frequently dropped upon the subject, and
the faot that it will be perfectly easy for your Highness to disregard
any recommendations whioh your Representative Assembly may
take upon themselves to make. The solution of most of the other
problems in Egyptian reorganisation will rest with the distinguished
Europeans, whom you have so kindly—again at my suggestion—
attaohed to the various Departments of State. It is impossible to
suppose that with such 'powerful coadjutors, your Highness should
ever for a moment feel a doubt as to the perfectly independent
position that yen so ably fill.
Finally, I do not hesitate to assure yeur Highness—but, as I
remarked before, quite in an unofficial sort of way—that the present
arrangements are intended by Her Majesty's Government both to
succeed, and, what is still more important, to endure, au intimation
whioh 1 am sure your Highness is quite acute enough to oomprehend
in all its significance. D-ff-r-n.

They'll utterance find on the opening day;
But some thrive on things in their present oondition,
And they, like the fishes, "prefer the old way."
It's a very bad way, marked by greed and stupidity,
Wicked monopoly, prodigal waste.
You want common-sense to contend with cupidity.—
Isn't it time that you gave 'em a taste P
I' ve bounty for all, but your Rings intercept it
Before it can reach those who need it the most.
They've the rule of the sea, when you ought to have kept it.
A thought that should check my Britannia's proud boast.
Here's largess I Just look at it! Ocean is teeming
With quite inexhaustible harvest of fish,
In number past counting, in worth beyond dreaming,
And free to the world; such at least is my wish.
But the harpies of Commeroe are ever beforehand
With poverty helpless, with dulness inert.
They take triple tithe e'er the wealth reaches your hand.
You've now a fresh Btart. Shall it be a mere spurt?
The poor, ah I poor souls, how I pity them, standing,
To ohaifer for refuse; the dregs of my wealth,
When the pick of my hoard they might all be commanding,
Snatched from them by Capital's sinister stealth.
The harvest is bountiful, opulent, stintless,
And none need be gleaners—there's plenty for all;
Miraculous draughts from my sea wide and printless
Are yours,—if you '11 only respond to my call.
St. Anthony's eloquent sermon was bootless;
Will men be as dull as the stock-fish or cod?
Shall Neptune's well-meaning remonstrance be fruitless?
Will Sense shut its ears to the ancient Sea-god?
Remember, when shouting in mighty applause of
Your big Exhibition just opened this May,
You have one other task—'tis to shut the huge jaws of
Trade's big greedy sharks who "prefer the old way."
"The Davey Case," recently brought before the sitting Magis-
trate at Bow Street, has nothing to do with Mr. Bradlaugh and
the Oaths Bill.

ATTRACTIVE BAIT AT THE INTERNATIONAL FISHERIES.
Last Saturday saw—though not very clearly—the Offishial Opening
of the International Fisheries Exhibition. It poured till nearly ten,
and then the streets were filthy. But inside the building the
arrangements were as perfect as possible. Uniforms—the naval pre-
dominating, of course—stars and garters, ribbons—very few blue
ones—and decorations everywhere.
The leading points of the ceremony were a well-delivered speech
by the Prinoe of Whales—(Ten Thousandth and last appearance of
this absolutely necessary joke this week,)—with a hearty finish
about an English welcome, whioh elicited some real English cheers.
The sesthetio Arohbishop, looking as if his long locks were still damp
after ooming out of his own See of Canterbury, then read a prayer con-
taining some appropriate Scriptural allusions—not a very diffioult
matter on such an occasion, though his Quite Too-Too Grace forgot to
make mention of Jonah and the Whale. The orisons being ended, the
choir struck up the Anoient Hundredth, "All people that on earth
do dwell," whioh isn't at first sight suggestive of anything to do
with the sea, specially as most people who on earth do dwell are
probably indifferent Bailors, and would rather remain where they are.
They should have sung " The Sea, the Sea, the Open Sea," which
would have been a fine Free-trading Cantiole, and as for the religious
Sart of the ceremony, they should nave engaged a few Sar-deans to
o it. However, his Too-Too Grace is to be congratulated on not
having seized the opportunity for a punning discourse on the Value
of Soles, Shellfishness, and bo forth.
Then the Prince deolared the building open; then more music;
and then the Procession returned as it came; and the spectators
returned, gradually, not as they came, thank goodness, which was
with a good deal of scrooging and pushing, but quietly wandering
about in the different Courts, inspecting the Chinese models .in what
seemed to be one of the most complete and interesting of all the depart-
ments, and being, in another plaoe, much exercised as to whether a
black sailor standing with an oar in his hand was a model, or real
flesh and blood. Personally, it struck me that he was both, as, in
spite of a crowd round him, half afraid to touch him or to ask
questions, he never moved a muscle, and even when it occurred to
me to test him with a silver coin, whioh I held up at some little
distance from him, but distinctly visible, he did not budge an inch;
though this might have been accounted for by the thought having
flashed across his mind that if he moved to take the coin, and so
spoil the illusion, I should have moved, too, at a rapid pace, and in
an opposite direction. I will not affirm that I should not have done
so; but I can testify that he remained statuesque to the last, and
that I left him the centre of attraction to an admiring crowd.
_ Visitors being hungry and thirsty, thronged the fish dinner, at
sixpence a head, which I could smell at a distance (there is a good
deal of flavour about the Fisheries), but into which I could not
squeeze, as it was "full up." The refreshment-rooms and the bars
were crowded.
The Fish-Market was an object of interest to many, who thought
they were going to take home the best fish a bargain, but who found
that as a rule they were selling at West-end prioes, and only offered
an inferior article at a less figure. This was a great disappoint-
ment to all who had anticipated pointing a moral from a fish's
When in working order, the plaoe ought to be a big su
if Greenwich dinners can be done for a shilling a head, the
and the other hotels may shut up for the season.
The Scotch Fisher-girls were in great form, and doing a good
trade in photographs. There were Norwegian Fisher-girls, and a
dummy fisher-girl from Boulogne, watching over a dummy fisher-
man lying helplessly on his back. Plenty of amusement, including
Picture Gallery, Aquarium, ordinary apparatus, and'.working machi-
nery. In the Pioture Gallery the portrait of .the celebrated Amr
Cliovy in oil is well worth seeing. Further detail on the earliest
opportunity.
With two Cartoons about the Fisheries, with Verses on the
subject, and an account of the Opening of the Exhibition, this is a
Fishy number of Punch. Quite an exception, of course.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
HXTBACTBD FROM
THE DIARY OP TOBY, M.P.
House of Commom, Monday Night, May 7.—Had a chat with
Statelet Hill to-night about the Far West. Hon. and learned
Gentleman one time thought might be made Solicitor-General.
But a grateful Government stopped Bhort at making him Judge-
Advocate of the Fleet.
"If it had been Lord High Admiral," he says, "I wouldn't have
minded. But other thing a little obscure. So turned iny atten-
tion to ranohing, and now own flocks and herds innumerable. Rough
lot of men out there; hard to deal with. Threatened outbreak
sometimes. Always quelled it in one way. Put on my wig and
gown, oarry in right hand patent as Judge-Advooate of the Fleet,
and go among them. Effect instantaneous. Roughest among them
quelled. No more trouble for weeks."
What I want to know frcn the learned Rancheman is as to pros-
peots out there of useful Dog not afraid of work. Early riser;
washing put out, and children not objeoted to. Seems to me the
sooner we 're out of this oountry the better. Did believe our Fleet was
pretty well, considering. Learn to-night this is quite a mistake.
Lord Henry Lennox ambling round the subject for au hour,
"like Mr. Mantalini in the bonnet-shop," Sir Thomas Brassey
growls, in that sea-dog voice learned on board the Sunbeam.
Couldn't make much out of Lord Henry, exoept " how very kind-
nothing oould be kinder—than everybody had been to him." This,
coupled with little reminisoenoes of the time, nearly two years all
told, when he was Seoretary to the Admiralty, together with what
he said to his noble friend on a particular oocasion, and what the
Right Hon. Gentleman said to him at some other time, made up an
agreeable hour and a half.
Quite at sea with Lord Henry. But afterwards a chorus of
dismal foreboding from Sir John Hat, Sir Edward Rsed, Mr. W.
H. Smith, and other great sea Captains. All pointed to one con-
clusion. We have no ships worth speaking of. Too fast, or too
slow, armour too heavy, too light, or in the wrong plaoe. Guns
bunt. Coal won't burn. Steam won't "get up" in the morning.
Dockyards inadequate In short, we shall be knocked into a oocked
hat, if Switzerland, Portugal, or any other Naval Power declared
war against us.
Before that day dawns I mean to be settled down on my own
ranche. Butinett done.—None.
Tuesday.—House of Lords debating question of Opening Museums
and Pioture Galleries on Sundays. Lord Dunraven pleaded cause of
intelligent working-man in moderate and lively speech. But
majority of House shooked at notion, and Motion rejected by three
to two. The Bishops turned out in great foroe, making a fine show
of lawn on the Bench below Ministers.
"Looks as if it was washing-day, and they had got the clothes
out early." Randolph says, gazing upon the soene from the
Gallery. New Archbishop present. Looks ^Esthetic Got his speech
ready. Intended when he came down to deliver it, but so nervous
couldn't get it off.
"Pity your Graoe should have had all this trouble," I Bay
(always like to be polite to an Archbishop); ." sure great loss to the
world so much eloquenoe, argument, and oommon sense."
'"Don't think it will be lost." said his Graoe, sweetly. "Preaching
shortly on the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah; shall be able to
use up a good many of the passages." His Grace ought to carry a
lily or a sunflower. Notice his Graoe wears his hair parted down
the middle, like his predecessor. Suppose this is part [of Archiepis-
copal full-dress. Ask Lord Rosebery.
Yes," he says: "you see it would not do to have in the Primate
a man of strong ideas and masterful ways. When you And a man
who has reached middle life and has never been able to decide on
which side he shall part his hair, he is in the running for the
Primacy. 'Au juste mi.ieu' is the motto for Canterbury."
Lord Cairns much pleased at result of Division.
"It's not, Toby," says he. "as if I asked working-man to do
what I wouldn't do myself. Never go into my own pioture gallery
on a Sunday. Lock it up on Saturday night. Also, after midnight
every Saturday, turn round pictures on dining-room walls, in pas-
sages, library, drawing-room, or wherever they might catch the eye
on the Sabbath." Business done in the Commons.—None.
Wednetday.—" I knew what would happen, when I let Playfair
bring in those pots of Oleo-Margarine, the Speaker said this
evening, as Lady Brand gave us a oup of tea. "'They're only
little ones,' Playfair urged. 'Yes,' I said, 'that's true enough.
If they were the size of a sponge-bath, of course you wouldn't bring
them in.' But I weakly yielded; and now here's Broadhurst
brought in a nail-making machine, whioh he calls an Oliver, and
works away, to illustrate the Motion for the Second Reading of a
Bill to amend the Workshops' Act."
"Couldn't you have ipt Winn to have given him a Rowland for
his Oliver?" I said, seeing the Speaker was really distressed.
"No," he answered, sadly, "that Winn-a do. The thing must be
met by an Order of the House. It '11 grow, till place becomes sort
of workshop, and we '11 have to build a shed on the site of the old
Law Courts to keep the materials for illustrating speeches. We
shall have Labouchere next ^bringing in a cobbler's stall, and
showing how they make boots in Northampton, whilst he pleads the
right of the constituency to have two representatives."
House a little startled when Broadhurst first produced his
machinery. Thought it might have something to do with explosions.
But only made nails. Most interesting process. You put a piece of
iron-piping in at one end, turn a handle, and tenpenny nails flow in
abundance from other end.
"Dear me!" said Bobby Spencer, who over the ring-fence of his
collar watched process with ohildish delight. (Subsequently, in cloak-
room, tried his hand with the machine, and made a few nails for
private circulation only.) "Really charming: but should have
thought it would have brought down the price of nails. Tenpence
apiece seems a good deal, don't you know.'
Thing sure to spread. Daresay, in moving Agricultural Holdings
Bill to-morrow night, Dodson will have a collection of spades,
mowing-maohines, Bteam-ploughs, and a few drain-pipes. Interest-
ing in its way. Makes the House a sort of superior Polytechnic ; but
likely to become inconvenient as oustom grows. Speaker's quite
right. He ought to have put down his foot on Play fair's pots.
Business done.—Miscellaneous. Threw out Broadhurst's Bill,
Oliver and all, by Bwingeing majority.
Thursday Night.—Grand Old Man in grand old passion to-night.
Came upon him after Division on Clause 13 in Customs and Inland
Revenue Bill, thrown out by a majority of seven. Tried to get out
of his way. Thought it would be pleasanter to have a chat with him
some other time. But he "was not to be denied," as they say in
prize-ring literature when one Gentleman succeeds in planting his
fist in particularly uncomfortable relation to the other one's face.
"I want to know, Toby," says he, his shirt-collars flapping in the
emotion of subdued rage like the mainsail of a yacht when you 're
luffing, or tacking, or doing something that makes the sail wobble,
"what I want to know is, who is to conduct the business of this
country? Is it me and my colleagues, or is it a few Gentlemen
below the Gangway, who are what they call Independent. Here's a
case affecting detail of administration in Tax-gathering Department.
Childers, on his responsibility, says it will work well, and save
£30,000 a year. Objeation taken on score of vested interests. Objec-
tion fully met by modification of scheme. The Conservative Oppo-
sition looking on, prick up their ears. They can't defeat us out of
their own ranks, but count on Land-Leaguers, and if they can get a
dozen or so of our men, they 're safe to run us close, or even defeat
as. That's all very well for them, but not for us, or for me. I can't
oarry on Government on those terms, and, what's more, I won't;"
and the Grand Old Man, with his head very high in the air, and a
red spot on either pale oheek, strode off before I oould explain that
it.wasn't my fault. Glad to be safe out of it on any terms.
Business done.—Another Government defeat. Early to-morrow
morning, Dodson, looming dimly out of the Fog, explained details
of Agricultural Holdings Bill.
Friday.—Spent afternoon more or less agreeably in foreign parts.
Grand Cross on first about Cuban Refugees; then Wilfrid Lawson
on Egypt. Finally, and appropriately, Ashmead Bartlett on
India. Ashmead would have undertaken either of the other parts
with equal readiness, but the others getting in first, took what was
left. Grand Cross got on pretty well, no one daring to smile. In
faot, scarcely anyone present either to smile or weep. General
impression House might as well have adjourned yesterday. But let
us eo now.
Business done.—Adjourned till Monday, 21st. Derby Day the 23rd.
So what's the use of meeting, exoept at Epsom, till the 21th?
A BRACING ATMOSPHERE.
Speaking of Mr. Gladstone at the dinner of the National Liberal
Club, the London Correspondent of the Sussex Daily Neics, says—
"A storm of cheering swept through the hall, and then the pale face and
the leonine front, which have been seen in the van of Liberal progress for so
many years, were hailed with thunderous acclamation. The tossing sea of
table napkins visibly braced Mr. Gladstone's spirits."
Why all this praise of the "leonine front," and no word about the
leonine oollars? The "leonine front" in the van, savours, too, a
little of the menagerie. We have heard of the bracing eifeots of sea-
air, but possibly a "tossing sea of table-napkins" may brace even
more tightly.

Time—A little before i p.m. at the height of the Season.
Mr. Burlington Brown (continuing discursive and enthusiastic
panegyric on the local improvements). The ohange is positively
wonderful. You woulda't know the place; and coming up from
Knightsbridire, I '11 really defy you to tell where you are. (Warming
with the subject.) You seem to be entering a lovely well-wooded
garden, winding deliriously away right to Westminster Abbey. And
then if you 're going West, Bloggam—and he knows a lot of Artists
and fellows of that sort, you know—says there's not a finer bit of
architectural landscape in Europe than the corner there. You have
the Hospital facing you, and those blocks, scaling—or whatever they
call it—right away down to the left. You should see it, as I do,
coming home from the Club at night I Why, Bloggam says it beats
the Piazza del la Signoria at Bologna, or Venice, or somewhere, all to
shivers. And he's right,
Mrs. Burlington Brown (pleasantly impressed). Dear me, how
very clever of the Lord Chamberlain to have managed it so nicely!
(Noticing a sudden alteration in the pace of the cab.) But what a
great number of carriages there seem to be out this afternoon I I
hope we shan't be late for the Gttrgotles P
Mr. B. B. Oh, no! lots of time. (Looks at hit Watch.) "Why.
we've seven minutes yet. Yon're thinking of the old state of
things, you know, when there always used to be that beastly jam at
the corner of Grosvenor Place, that made you late for everything.
All changed now. That's the point of all this improvement:
oarting off the Old Duke and all the rest of it. (Again warming with
hit subject.) Oh, it's capitally managed I You'll see presently.
They've cut one road somehow clean across, you know; taken a
piece off the Corner, with a nice slope, and a curve right down to the
top of Thingummy Street that goes into Belgrave Square, don't
you know? and then they've made another that curls the other way,
to take all the back traffic; and then there's one to relieve the Park
entrance,—awfully well dodged, that! And so you see it doesn't
matter where you 're coming from or where you 're going, there's
no waiting, and jamming, and letting you through a turnstile, and
all the rest of it, as there used to be; but there's lots of room for
everybody, and you just fall into your proper stream, and there's
no more hitch than there is if you were on the Embankment. (Cab
comes to a dead halt.) Hum I I don't ever remember to have seen
itso orowded.
[Looks out, and watches seven-and-thirty^omnibuses, carriages,
coal-waggons, cabs, drays, and tradesmen's carts pats from
somewhere to somewhere else at right angles, while a Police-
man, who is superintending the procession with a sense of
proprietorship, puts the back of a white Berlin glove at
intervals deprecatingly into the cab-horse's eye.
Mrs. B. B. (after three minutes and a half of it). My dear, I'm
sure we shall be late. Why, it seems as bad as ever it was.
(Coming to the point.) Worse, I think,
Mr. B. B. Oh no,—it isn't worse. It's all right. It 'a only
temporary, whatever it is. TheTe must be some Volunteers, or
something. (Nettled: with suppressed anger to Cabman.) Confound
it, why can't you get on?
Cabman (not unreasonably). Oet on P I should like to see anyone
get on in this here jam. -

places the back of a white Berlin glove at intervals depreca-
tingly into cab-horse's eye, and allows another procession of
thirty-seven more omnibuses, carriages, cabs, coal-waggons,
carts and drays to pass on from somewhere to somewhere
else at rioht angles in obstructive ease.
Mr. B. B. (after another six minutes of it, in which he has taken
with more or less inaccuracy the numbers of three separate Proprie-
tary Policemen, an Omnibus Conductor, a couple of Cabmen, together
with the addresses of the owners of seven private carriapts and of
a butcher boy,—recanting with warmth). It's scandalous, infamous!

HAKesh a Mabl 'ppear" [Sits doton!
our orrisiiiAL guide.
Part L—Preliminary and Artistic.
First catch your Catalogue, whioh. containing, as it does, only about eight
hundred pages of printed matter, is admirably adapted for the pocket of any
waistcoat large enough to admit it. Having secured your Catalogue, remember
that you are in search of fish. Produce the excellent plan you will find at the
commencement of the tiny little volume, and, if with a companion inclined to
punning, beg him to let off all his side-splitters about the names of fish, such as
"sole ideas," "getting a comfortable plaioe," "taking to his eels," "herring
and straying," at once, and have done with them.
On your road to the land whioh was once known as Brompton, but whioh
now boasts an infinitely "genteeler" title, you will discover that the local
colouring is unquestionably nautical. You will meet boatmen by the score; and
whenever you get to a cab-stand, there you will find an attentive waterman.
On the pavement you will notioe that a fair proportion of the passengers are
"half-seas over," and further observe that the nouses have all their blinds down,
no doubt to keep out the gaze of the public " gaze " being used here as an alter-
native word to avoid a tautological repetition of the noun substantive " see."
Finally, to generally suggest ships, there is not a single shop on the line of route
without its sales. So much for side-splitters, and now to business.
You pass the turnstile, and find yourself in the department devoted to
"Fine Arts." For a moment you are lost in wonder. On both hands you see the
most beautiful designs in fresco, whioh you are told, in bold gold letters, are
all painted on "Willesden paper." Here is a charming view of the Sewage
Works of the Native Guano Company, in whioh two contented cows are intro-
duced with perfectly startling effeot. Close by this specimen of Fine Art are
some exquisitely gilded roasting-jacks, or hooks. They are so cleverly painted,
and so very much like screws, that you come to the conclusion that they would
have been more appropriate in a horse-show than where they are—a hall devoted
toPisoioulture in all its branohes. Next to this great painting is an announcement
about somebody's Marmalade (a quaint sort of fish found
in Spain and Scotland), which faces a spirited drawing of
a Lady in a long cloak dancing a friendly jig with a
Bear. But there are not only fresooes in this depart-
ment, but framed paintings. Strange to say, these are
not water-colours. However, as some of the exhibits
come from a long distance, no doubt the Artists elected
to preserve their works in oil. Amongst the best are
several specimens from the Fishmongers Company. But
private individuals have also been generous in their con'
tributions. Amongst the rest is a Mr, Target, who
rather lays himself open as a mark for a joke by dub-
bing himself, in large letters, a "Piscatorial Artist."
He has sent a picture of a fish, whioh is infinitely better
than some of the rougher chalk drawings so frequently
discovered on the London pavements. As he modestly
asks £52 10». for this speoimen of "piscatorial" art, no
doubt there will be a rush of bank-note holders to the
office. By the way, it is amusing to note how some
of the pictures have been valued by their owners. Two
productions by Mr. Dandy Sadler, of nearly the same
size, are valued respectively at £800 and £120. The con-
trast in price is very marked, as the two paintings hang
close together. However, as in the higher-valued design
a number of monks are represented fishing, possibly
the price of this work of Art may be connected with
a Cell.
At present the piotures are not very well numbered.
A label attached to the frame gives the only informa-
tion, and in some cases the label is wanting, so that you
have to fish for the subject, which, by the way. in such
a plaoe, is a very appropriate occupation. This omis-
sion is noticeable in a very fine work on the wall facing
the British Sea Department. Fortunately, the subject
explains itself. The Artist has commemorated an occasion
of no small historical interest whioh, hitherto, has alto-
gether escaped the attention of our modern chroniclers.
After a hard and not very successful day's angling, three
fishers have come to take their rest in their Inn, and to
while away the time with some strange game of cards
before the appearance of dinner. The three companions
are no lesser persons than the late Charles Dickens,
Canon Oaklet, and Mr. Bradlaugh — all admirable
likenesses. The Canon and the junior Member for North-
ampton have been drinking some compound, to the
character of which a glass, oontainingthe shreds of a lemon
and some melted sugar, humorously furnishes the due.
All three are smoking long day pipes, but Mr. Charles
Dickfn9 has been taking snuff instead of whiskey. The
Artist has seized the moment when the Maid of the Inn
waggishly produces some bread, cheese, beer, and a
lettuoe with whioh to frugally regale her three hungry
visitors. Mr. Bradlaugh denounces this outrage with
much animation, while the celebrated Novelist regards
the author of the mauvaise plaisanterie with vigorous
indignation. Even the white-headed Canon seems
annoyed at the unseasonable drollery. Altogether this
is one of the most interehting piotures in the Exhibition,
and should be purchased for presentation to the National
Portrait Gallery, which is conveniently situated next
door.
Another little work, also nnlabelled, in this depart-
ment is assuredly a perfect gem in its way. The Artist
has depicted, on a small canvas, a glass nearly full of
wine, which has been sipped and left hurriedly, some
shell-fish of a weird character, and a dyspeptic-looking;
lemon. In a few vigorous touches he has thus suggested
a tragedy. Need it be said after this that the missing
title must be. "A Bad Oyster t"
And now, having cast a first glance at the wonders of
Art in the Exhibition, a pause can be appropriately made
before considering, on a future occasion, the beauties of

BOUND FOR MOSCOW.
(From a Nervous Special.)
Sent for by the Editor of the Boomerang. Not always a delect-
able experience to be sent for by the Editor of the B. The reason is
generally that you omitted two epigrams of Lord Randolph's in
your Parliamentary Report, or wasn't quite np in the subject of
herrings (having put them all down as red) in that Leader on the
Fisheries Exhibition. This time, however, I wasn't conscious of a
comma left out, and so faced the Chief without a tremor.
There was no doubt about the honour conferred. Our Own Special
at a Czar's Coronation is a somebody in journalism. You can't come
down to describing living- Chess Tournaments after that; and the
chances are that FrintiDg-House Square may receive you when you
are somewhere about sixty, and are an authority on statistics con-
nected with the Dutch doll-trade.
The Chief is amiable, too amiable, for there is a certain tender
tone of commiseration in his explanations that is not encouraging.
It is Moscow—it is the Coronation; my foot is in the stirrup, aod
the Fourth Estate is my own. There is a certain diffidence though,
about the Chief, which is rather disquieting. I am not used to the
Chief being diffident with me. As a rule he is rather the contrary.
He asked after my wife and family in a way that, while it touched
me, was a little disturbing. And I couldn't quite see why he
emphasised the fact that the Life Insurance Company, the Phoenix,
was a safe and accommodating one, and had advertised in the news-
papers for the last fifteen years. Still, I am to have the place nearest
the Czar; and the Chief wants to know if I shall be satisfied with
Half a Million.
I am satisfied; but I didn't know that the preparations were so
costly. I find that it costs ten thousand pounds to insure my life
for a hundred; I must make my will; my wife insists upon two
years' income in advance (in case of Siberia); there is a regular pro-
cession of friends to bid me good-bye in a disgustingly affectionate
and my bomb-proof breastplate has just come home with a
bill for three thousand pounds. When it oomes to the steel gaiters
and boots, I don't think there will be much left of the Half a
Million.
Almost wish I hadn't aocepted the Half Million. I have just dis-
covered that all the staff of the Boomirang dtclined the post, except
an offioe-buy, who is too consistently beaten by a brother addicted
to rum hot j he was tired of his life, he >aid. The Railway Companies
want to know whether I will indulge in an iron-olad carriage. I
will. It appears to be the thing, but ironclad railway carriages
aren t oheap; and the Half Million is going down rapidly.
The Halt Million is gone. The last protection, a body-guard of
Deteotives and Prize-fighters finally exhausted tbe subsidy; and
now if anybody will give me a nioe quiet County Court reporter's
place, MusooTy knows me not, and the Boomerang may send its
office-boy.
"O Tempora!"
To malign the Equator was held a bold action,
St. Stephen's can show a more mischieTous crime;
He, surely, has fathomed the depths of detraction
Who's ready to talk against Time.'
Checkmate !—The gigantio Plaida that Ladies are now wearing*
for dresses are said to last for a lone while. Let us hope the extra-
yaganoe of the check may prove a oheok upon extravagance.
Roe, Bbothehs, Roe !—The Fishermen who are up for the Exhi-
bition, seem to be having a jorial time of it. They have been all day
and every day driving about town in vans like a jolly set of Van
Trumps. The thirteen vehicles pulled up in line at the entrance of
the Ride, and the Fishermen gave three hearty cheers when they
saw our Rotten Row. Odd thing for Fishermen to be pleased with.
They might as well have hurrah'd on seeing a bit of bad fish.

So back to the sea every day goes a heap,
While the Public look on groaning.
Three Stores were set up some miles from the Tower,
And the fish got West all over the town,
Ami the Middlemen oried, "We're in for a shower,
If this goes on 1 Why, the price will come down!
For men will dine, and—if they can—cheap,
And the Publio seems waking at last from its sleep—
It's so precious tired of groaning!"
Three Bankrupts are showing their empty hands,
And all that they get for their pains is a frown,
And a " Serve you right—why, 'twas your demands

HOLIDAY PLOTS.
Lord R-nd-lph Ch-reh-U. Think I see my way to inflicting
another crushing defeat on Government after Whitsuntide. That
decision of House with regard to Inoome Tax Collectors was a
regular knock-down blow for G ladstone. Quite wonder he's able
to be so cheerful at Hawarden after it. Speaking personally, I
should call it not merely a defeat, but a disaster. Strange that
Cbildehs doesn't see it in that light and resign at once. However,
the next blow of this sort must finish the Ministry. Have arranged
with Gobst that he is to move artful amendment to Tenants' Com-
pensation Bill—" House considers that Law of Distraint, if treated
at all, should be dealt with in a separate measure." This will gain
votes of Radicals, who are wild with Government for not abolishing
Distress altogether; Whigs, who are glad of any decent excuse for
shelving the subjeot; and Home-Rulers, of course. Don't quite like
mixing with latter. Haven't yet subscribed to Parnell Testimonial
Fund. Still, they are useful sometimes, and I can chuck'em over easily
when our Party in power. With help of ordinary Opposition, led by
their very ordinary leader, Staffr, who 'U follow me into Lobby
like a lamb, aa he always does after little speech to show my motion
not in the least necessary, believe I can easily beat Gladstone!
However, if that dodge fails, Wolfe's got another. In Supply,
when few Members present, means to move to reduce Deputy-Door-
keeper's salary by ten shillings yearly. Below-Gangway Radicals
will be with him to a Professor. Fancy I can finesse a triumph, and
then a glorious future opens before me I Impossible for any Ministry
to carry on government of a country when defeated on question of
salary for a Deputy-Doorkeeper.
Mr. Boanerges Timoleon Cobden Smith, M.P. Don't care what
Gladstone thinks of me. Principle before Party, /say. If Wolfe
does really propose reduotion of Deputy-Doorkeeper's salary, shall
certainly vote with him. "Fiat Economy, Ruat Gladstone!"
Don't relish voting against Government, but what on earth is the
i good of having principles, if one doesn't assert 'em at most inconve-
nient time? Then there's Gorst proposing to deal with Law of
Distress in separate Bill. Cordially approve of the idea, though not
of Go rst. Let's abolish Distress altogether! Distressing, of course,
to vote with Fourth Party, but oan't be helped.
The Parnellite Member. Down with the Tyrants of the Treasury
Bench 1 Churchill is really quite polite to us, occasionally. Can't
we get up debate on recent executions? Don't approve of murder—
oh dear, no! Still, should like to worry old Mabwood a little.
Harcourt bound to defend him. There's Wolfe's Motion about
Deputy-Doorkeeper. Rather a nioe fellow, I fancy. Found him
quite tender when he's been conducting me out of the House on the
frequent occasions of my suspension for insulting language. Sorry
to do anything to injure Deputy-Doorkeeper's feelings, but principle
first, of ooursel If we can only defeat Government on this vital
point, perhaps the hated Saxon wiU give us a Parliament of our own,
and come and Bpend his money among us, too.
The Hon Trevor FUztrevor. Told to-day by Charlie at our Club
(the "Exclusive") that Gladstone was reaUy intriguing to sur-
render Egypt to Transvaal Boers! This is dreadful, if true. Always
thought Gladstone—but no, must really try and remember that I
was returned as a good Liberal, or at all events as a good Whig.
Charlie says Government is going to dish all great estates, by
abolishing Law of Distress. Don't know what Law of Distress
means. Suppose some of my Constituents do. Wonder what they
think about Law of Distress P All I know is that some of 'em are
awfully angry at my.vote against Affirmation Bill. Wonder if
Charlie's right when he says Birmingham fellows will have all our
estates if I don't vote "the straight ticket"—meaning, for Gobbt's
Amendment. Why not stay away from Division P Cha bt.tr's just
arranged an awfully jolly week—Epsom, yacht to Cherbourg, three
days at Paris, and back. Whips will be at me like anything if I go
away. Hang the Whips I Hang Gladstone too! No. on second
thoughts, must try and recollect how good a Liberal I really am. But
just one vote oan't matter much to Government, can it P No, shall go
with Charlie, and explain things to my Constituents if Government
is defeated. \_And, if this sort of thing goes on, it possibly may be.

THE PRINCES AMONG THE FISHMONGERS.
The dream of my erly youth, the one fond ope of my blooming manhood, and the principle
hohject of my full blown wigerous egsistence is aeomplisht, and I have had the crowning glory
of waiting upon all the Royal Princes of the British Crown at one time 1
Ah 1 that was a Bankwet that was I I have offen and often had the question put to me by
elustreous f orTeners and strangers of distinkshun, which was the principle Guild in the hole
City of London? and I have deolined to anser the question for fear of giving a fenoe, but after
last Satterday's show up in the way of Princes and Dooks and Markisses and EmbaBeaders and
setterer, I hessitates no longer but at wunoe gives the Parm Tree to the honest Fishmongers.
The Prince of Whales is sumbedy I suppose, speshally among Fishmongers, and his three
Royal Brothers is somebody I suppose, let alone his Uncle and his Nevvy and his Cousin, and
they was all there. And then oomes the pint as fills me with wunder and admirashun. Who
was it as presided over the whole Royal and distingwished compny, a Royal Prince, a nobel
Dook, ahonerary MarkisP no, but plane Mr. Hamden. And who is plane Mr. Hamdenr
Why, a meer umbel Citizen, like myself, who has to get his own living, like myself, and
who is proud of the fao, like myself. The
Lord Chamberlain oan't say, with his
Brummagem sneer, that he toils not neither
does he spin, for he does both, if not acshally
yet allegollioally. And yet he has to play
the host to such a lot of Royal Princes as
'ud make a lot of hungry raddikles go down
on their knees even to look at. Ana then to
hear the honest pride with whioh the Prinoe
of Wales and his Royal Brethren boasted
of being Fishmongers. And I declare it
amost drew tears to my eyes when the poor
Dook of Cambridge asked so perthetically
why he had been left like a fish out of
water, and not honoured like his Royal Cuz-
zens. I think I may wentur to prosefy that
his Royal Ighness won't have to wait long.
I don't suppose as nobody never thought
as the Fishy Kxhebishun could possibly fail,
but when H.R.EL drunk success to it in a
glass of 1820 Sherry, of course that success
was insured. I took care to have a glass out
of H.R.H.'s bottle after he left, and it
suttenly was as fine a glass of Sherry as
even I ever tasted, though it was growed
before ever H.R.H. or me was borne.
I have offen noticed as Revrend Gentlemen
injoys a good dinner and likes a bit of fun
as well as a Common Councilman himself.
Why even a Bishop has his little joke sum-
times on these intresting ooashuns. But I
couldn't help thinking as Mr. Lowell was
rather a drawing the broad arrow wen he
said as how he wunce caught a fish in
Ameriky as cost three dollars a inch! I
should like to be a patient angler in that
River mvself.
H.R.H. the Duke of Edinboro would of
course as a Royal Prince scorn to say nothink
as wasn't striokly true, but he suttenly took
the breath away from a good many of us
Waiters, as well as from a good many other
of the principle guests, when he told us that
in Horsetria, insted of the farmers having
the same rowtation of crops as they has here,
they aoshally grows one year Oats, and the
nex year Tummets, and the nei year Fish.
Ah that must be summut like a Crop that
must; speshally as sum of the Fish is 6 foot
long. I think of the two this rayther beat
the Story of the Revrend Minister from
Ameriky. H.R. H. the Duke of Connought
gave the toast of the evening namely the
Lord Mare and Copperashun, and the Lord
Mare made the German Ambassider quite
start on his chair, tho he is 6 foot 3 high,
by telling em all as he and the Copperashun
together had spent three millions of golden
suvereigns in building Markets, and yet
people wasn't sattisfied.
Brown said as his hart was in his mouth
for fear as any of the Royal Princes should
drop a nint about the rayther sorowged oon-
dishun of triumfant Billinsgate, but I had
no suoh fear. If our Prinoes ain't Gentle-
men, I should like to know who is, and if a
Waiter don't know a gentleman when he
sees him, 1 should like to know who does,
and one trew Gentleman never makes an-
other trew gentleman unoumfertable.
For picturesk effeot and hartistio merit,
I never seed anythink like the gorgeous row
of Royal Gentlemen behind the Princes'
cheers. It was reelly sumthink amost sub-
blime. 1 don't mind confessing that for
wunoe I was jest a little bit enwious, but it
was only for a moment. Who nose what
awful responserbility rests on their broad

ACT I.
The snow lies on the hill-side, and the travellers are few.
"This very night, long years ago," quoth Huns. "the Polish Jew
Was murdered." So the gossips talk, and Mmhias sits there—
What is it stop the hand that lifts the glass? What makes him glare?
It is because he hears the sound, his endless horror tells,
Unheard by other ears than his, the jangling of the Bells!
ACT II.
Annette shall marry Chrittian, a brave and gallant lad:
We '11 count the girl her dowry out—i'faith it's not so bad;
Here's one old ooin among the rest—my eyes are glazed and dim-
No! No I There's blood upon that pieoe—the gold that came from
him!
Then oomes the gay betrothal feast, but mid the music swells,
Unheard by other ears than his, the jangling of the Bells!
ACT III.
Sleep soundly, Mathias, to-night, in that thou sleep'st alone,
And not a soul oan hear thy cry, or agoni>ing groan;
But oh! the horror of that dream I—the Judges sit for doom,
And thou must aot in broad daylight the murder done in gloom.
They burst the door I What fearsome fate the dying man compels
To hear, unheard by other ears, the jangling of the Bells!
• •••••
And when the Curtain has rung down, and all the play is o'er,
The memory of that night, methinks, will live for evermore;
We see the Actor's earnest faoe, hi* agony supreme,
That thrills us through and through, and holds us breathless in the
dream.
While in our ears for many a day thereafter certes dwells
The tintinnabulation of those well-remembered Bells I

THE RATIONAL DRESS SHOW.
{By Our Fair Correspondent.)
In the Hall of the Prinoe is a Show—stuffs and chintzes—
(0 Maidens of England, pray list to my song!)
For all there displayed is a warning that Ladies,
In matters of dressing, are terribly wrong!
I thought my new bonnet, with roses upon it,
And tasteful costume, was complete, I confess;
Bat now I 'm reminded my eyes have been blinded
To all the requirements of Rational Dress!
We look at the models—they pnzzle our noddles—
Regarding them all with alarm and surprise I
Eaoh artful oostumer revives Mrs. Bloomer,
And often produces an army of guys.
The costume elastic, the dresses gymnastic
The wonderful suits for the tricycle-ess—
Though skirts be divided, I 'm clearly decided,
It isn't my notion of Rational Dress I
See gowns hygienic, and frocks calisthenio,
And dresses quite worthy a modern burlesque;
With garments for walking, and tennis, and talking,
All terribly manful and too trouseresque!
And habits for riding, for skating, or sliding,
With "rational" features they olaim to possess;
The thought I can't banish, they 're somewhat too
mannish,
And not quite the thing for a Rational Dress I
Note robes there for rinking, and gowns for tea-drinking,
For yaohting, for olimbing, for cricketing too;
The dresses for boating, the new petticoating,
The tunios in brown and the trousers in blue.
The fabrics for frookings, the shoes and the stockings,
And corsets that ne'er will the figure compress:
But in the whole placeful there's little that's graceful
And girlish enough for a Rational Dress!
'lis hardy and boyish, not girlful and coyish—
We think, as we stroll round the gaily-dight room—
A masculine coldness, a brusquenees, a boldness,
Appears to pervade all this novel costume I
In ribbons and laces, and feminine graces,
And soft flowing robes, there's a charm more or
I don't think I '11 venture on dual garmenture,
I fancy my own is the Rational Dress!

Glad to come here on dooty, 'cos, bein' a pote, I can pass the dreemy

later. 'Ad chat with him, but he ain't no sole for potry, an 'as 'is hone
Mary Hanne to look out for. 'Is comes from Oxfut Street: mine I
xpex from Kumblan Plaice. Lots of omnibuses, carts, and oabs. Most
of the female sex in a 'urry 'ere, and wants to go on by 'bus. Lots of
elderlies as gets frightened and loses theirselves, but that ain't
nuthin' to me. Nuthin' to do, and t'other Constabel bein' some distance
off, can't get no emusin conversation. No nuts worth speakin' of at
this time o' year. Keep a look out for Mary Hanne. If you've a
heye for the pickoheresk, Oxf at Street's a pretty sight, and Bays-
water's another, while the Edgware Road and Kumblan Plaioe and
the Marbel Arch is things of booty as is a joy for ever, but I'd
rather see Mary Hanne.
Hallo! while I've been jottin' down these reflekshuns there's a
difficulty. A cart's been run into by a 'bus, somebody's been
knocked down, there's a ram-jam block in the middle of the road,

other way as if peering into the dietint fushur. Let the old Gent

OUR OFPISHIAL GUIDE.
Past II.—Gastronokic.
Bkfoki the South Kensington Building was opened, the general impression
on the mind of the British Publio was that, with the unbarring of the portals,
would commence a new era for the fish consumer. It was assumed that the
Exhibition was to "bring down" the price of salmon, soles, eels, and turbot
The masses were to be regaled for next to nothing on "the harvest of the sea,"
and epicures were to revel economically on all sorts of rare and expensive
piscatorial a.trees. Unhappily, the pleasant vision was merely a dream, for
it is now certain that the typical cheap fishmonger is a delusion, if not a snare.
The seeker for an unooatly Greenwich dinner can at any rate soon find the
dining saloons. These are to his left as, after passing the prinoipal entrance,
he walks through the gallery devoted to British Sea Fisheries. He must be
oaref ul though which department he selects, or he will be maddened with the
suggestion of a waiter tbat he should partake of ''the half-crown cold-meat
dinner," or enjoy "the unlimited supply of cake," which is the prinoiple feature
of the eighteen penny tea. Say that he finds himself in the proper room, and
cheerily asks lur the ti»h dinner.
"Fieh dinner, Sir I" exclaims a waiter, in a tone which proves that the
suggestion comes upon him with the force of perfect novelty. "Yes, Sir, if you
like-but there's ox tail and mock turtle soup, and the beef is in first-rate
condition."
"1 want neither meat nor soup," replies the greedy and hungry one. "I
am here to eat fish— 1 want a h»h dinner."
"Yes, Sir'f" interrogatively suggests the waiter, and then, apparently
pulling himself together to formulate the required but novel meal, he adds,
confidentially, "Tell you what, Sir,—take the 'Maynoo' and choose three
'follers'; tbat 'i what you can do, Sir,—choose three 'loUers.'"
Thus urged, the would-be diner glances at the bill of fare, and finds that
the refreshments are under the direction of a well-known firm of contractors,
and that the viands, &c, set down, are those usually found in the programme
of a City or West-End Kestaurant. The three 'follers' are small dishes of fish
- >m h as brill, salmon, whitebait, and cod. It has been known lor a waiter
(either under oiders, or on his own responsibility) to otter to furmth a fourth
. foller." The entertainment (as tbey tay at the Theatre) to conclude with
I Grujeie chetBe, and pulled bread. Price three (hillings —waiter not included.
But if the fish dinner—so far as its oheapnesa is con-
cerned —is disappointing, a thousand times more irritating
is the Fish Market. At any rate, here the British Publio
had a right to expect something extremely economical.
On entering the Annexe, devoted to the furtherance
of piscatorial reform, the visitor is struck with the
names of the salesmen. Familiar titles from Cheapside,
Bond Street, and the Strand appear on every hand.
iemingly, the Managers of the Exhibition let out the
stands in "the Cheap Fish-Market" to the highest
bidders. Be this as it may, a very small reduction is
effected in West-End prices, and, on the whole, quota-
tions average lower at the Army and Navy Auxiliary
Stores. And yet the Publio, fondly fancying that they
are purchasing fish on exceedingly advantageous terms,
Hock to the counters and tender their geld and Bilver
in exchange for baskets of the regulation pattern. To-
wards the evening some of the salesmen shout out such
bargains as "six bloaters going for sixpence," much to
the interest of an exoited crowd of sightseers. The
market is strongly suggestive of an ordinary English-
man, in fanoy dress, trying to enter into the "spirit of
the thing" at a Parisian opera masked ball. In fact,
the whole affair is theatrical and unreal. There is also a
Foreign Fish Market situated in an out-of;the-way corner
in rear of the Aquarium. However, the site of this insti-
tution is of no very great importance, for the simple
reason that at present the building is used as a lumber
room. Altogether, the Committee may be congratulated
on performing a miracle. Their market is square in
shape, and yet it strongly resembles a ring.
Lastly, before leaving the Exhibition, it is necessary,
for the sake of completeness, to refer to the School of
Cookery. This excellent institution is situated just
beyond the hall devoted to the sixpenny luncheon (said
to be very good, but, as a rule, inaccessible without a
hand-to-hand fight with thousands of would-be sixpenny-
lunchers), and is under the charge of a fatherly-looking
individual, who puts you into a place where 'you can
get a good view of the demonstration" with all the
solemnity of a gastronomic pew-opener. The Lady
Superintendent wears a neat costume, garnished with a
good deal of white muslin, and illustrates her lecture
praotioally. She is very deliberate with her statements,
and as she makes a long pause between each of her sen-
tences, the effect is that of extreme jerkiness. The
leoture is something like the following:—
Lady Superintendent [smiling). I am now going to
fry a slip. (Greedy Man in the audience putt on hit
spectacle!, and stands up.) I take the slip and cover it
with Borne beaten-up eggB. (Old Lady on a front bench
seems much surprised.) I beat up the eggs thus. [Beats
them up—long pause. Masher makes a mental not*
of the operation.) Now I paste the slips like this. [Pastes
them—long pause—little girt yawns, and is reproved by
her mother.) With a paste-brush is the best. [Longer
pause—Greedy deeply interested.) And I have some
bread-orumbs in this bag. They should be sifted freely
— [Long pause)—or else they become mouldy. I dip the
slips into the bread-crumbs—[Exciting operation—Greedy
Man all attention.)—and then 1 put them into this clarified,
fat. (Greedy Man becomes so interested that he approaches
the table and smells the compound.) It seems a great deal,
but it is more economical in the end. [Several Ladies in
the audience make notes in their pockit-bouks.) And
when the slips are cooked— [Long pause)—I garnish
them with fried parsley. [Long pause.) Here it is.
(The Slips are finished, and the Greedy Man gloats over
the picture.) And now I think we will grill a mackerel
with maitre d hotel sauce. I take the hell, cut it open,
and remove the backbone.
[And the lecture is continued with longer pauses than
ever, and to the ever-increasing excitement of the
Greedy Gentleman in spectacles.
And now, having turned aside in the Exhibition for a
moment to discuss the material provisions for the body,
it is most desirable to return as speedily as possible to a
consideration of the ethereal food for the mind: emphati-
cally "the mind," as we are not going to be induoed to
make the sole joke which is usually eerved up on such an
occasion.

A CRY FROM THE SHOP!
Whit is (his they are saying of Commons in Kent as free as the air to the poor we pity P
With thousands of aores of golden gorse given up at the will of an opulent oity P
Is it true in the blue of the Cater ham Vale they have settled a mighty estate for ever
On the heirs to oome of the toiling town, that tyrant force cannot change or sever P
Have they driven away, with his trowel and hod, the builder of houses they call " genteel,"
And granted a gift of the fields of God to the women and men who in gratitude kneel
At the foot of the throne of the great King Lud, who, in regal fashion, without set speeches,
Has purchased peaoe for the Kpping glades, and solitude given to Burnham Beeches?
It.is well, my Brothers—these things are done, with the aid of wealth, for the good of the
Stop!
Just listen I For high above chorus of praise is heard a complaint—'tis a cry from the Shop!
We hear very much of the rioh and the poor, of conflict of capital, class against olass,
Of Fashion that saunters in parks at the West, whilst the East may not treasure an acre of
grass.
When a holiday comes, be it " Derby" or not, just a feast of St. Lubbock when energies sink,
Ihe philanthropist puts on his sanctified tone, and declares we do nothing but guzzle and
drink.
It is kindly assumed that the sea and the sky, the woods and the fields with their emerald
green.
Do not gladden men's eyes at the days as they are, or recall the delights of the days that have
been.
But we never do hear when the summer-time oomes of the women and men who are fettered
to sorrow
At the tyrannous heels of a bullying trade that is all to-day and has no to-morrow;
Of the luckless slaves in a land that is free, where the terrible traders never say " Stop I"
For the sun may shine, and the trees may wave, but hearts they must break with despair in
the Shop I
We see you pass, when the sultry day has changed to an exquisite afternoon,
Away from town to pleasure and play, through blossoming May and flowering June;
We follow your steps as the fanoy leads, and hear your merriment down the street,—
You take our thoughts to the breezes pure, and leave us here in the blinding heat.
When the traffic outside has a lazy air, and the glaring pavement's hard and gritty,
When business fades like the goods we sell, and we 're left to groan in the lonely City,
Do you never onoe think, you women and men who jauntily speed to your parks and pleasure,
Of the weary souls you have left behind with their tedious tape and tiresome measure t
Does it never strike any for Charity's sake one coin of thought in our tills to drop,
That we may be free as our brothers are free, of the toil and the town, of the street and the
Shop?
It is nothing to us that the gorse is gold, that Epping is free and the Burnham Beeches,
We care to little that woods are oool, or the river has rest on its dreamy reaches;
It is only in dreams that the crioketers shout in far-off meadow-lands miles away,
It it only hope that brings to an end the terrible close of a pitiless day,
We seize the blinds and we drag them down, to darken the oheat of the blinding sun,
We face despair when the day begins, and tigh our thanks when the day is done.
It were better for us if the heaven grew black, and the blue of the sky were clouded o'er,
Than feel the hush of the silent streets, aod see the Sun at the open door;
Oh! hear us, Brothers and Sisters, too I You have hearts like ours; so in meroy stop,
And listen a little to those who plead, in suppliant tone, this cry from the Shop!
HARLEQUIN SACRED JACKASS;
OS, THE SLEEPINa BUMBLES IN THE WOOD.
This old, but not very popular Pantomime, has been revived at the Strand, in the height
of the London Season, with the suocess that usually attends the Parochial Drama. The
audienots have been numerous, if not very select, and the language used occasionally has been
deoidedly unfit for publication. The Opening Scene, called Chaos is Cons Again," is a
marvel of realistio arrangement, and quite worthy of being studied by those Stage Managers
wbo are rapidly replaoiug the scene-painter with the stage-carpenter and brioklayer. The
ballet of Slumbering Navigators is one of the most dreamy thiDgs ever seen out of the Land
of Lotos-tating, and the calm of the reclining workmen, who lie on their backs, with their
pipes in their mouths, and their caps half-drawn over their eyes, while the howling traffic
struggles past them on either side, is perfectly statuesque and supernatural.
'Ihe Chairman of the District Board of Works, who fills the arduous role of Clown, has
probably never been equalled tince the days of Gkimaldi, and the part of Pantaloon is
admirably rilled by another Member of the Board—a shopkeeper, whose shop is luckily in
another neighbourhood.
The way the water was suddenly cut off from restaurants and theatres—especially from
theatres, which are supposed to want water to put out incessant fires—was one of the funniest
things we have teen in the whole range of pantomime.
It is impossible to grasp all the manilold beauties of this performance at one visit, but
the broad and reckless humour is obvious at a glance. The gentleman who plays the Demon
Bumble—a. cheesemonger, whose name is not mentioned in the bills—is adequate in his part,
and the ChoruB of Condemned Ratepayers is a very foroible and dramatic production. The
piece is sure to run to the end of the Season.

A LAY OF MODERN RUSSIA.
Czah Alexander Romanoff,
By all his Saints he swore
His Oala Day at Moscow
Should be delayed no more;
By all his Saints he swore it,
And settled it for May,
And sent his invitations forth,
To East and West, to South and North,—
But didn't name the day.
To every Court in Europe
The invitation oomes,
And thoughtfully is scanned throughout
With frequent " Hahs I" and " Hums 1"
Shame on the doubting Monarchs
Who fear the Kremlin's dome,
And rather than be blown to bits
Prefer to stay at home.
But well the courtly footmen
Have worked with might and main,
While flags and incandescent lamps
Pour in by every train:
Till for the meanest attio
The richest Noble strives,
As just before the Czar turns up,
Great G.A.S. arrives.
And now the splendid pageant
Bursts on the gaping crowd,
And in a million savage throats
Barbaric cheers are loud;
While through their midst, upon his steed,
Their Czar comes prancing by,
And gives the Nihilistio boast
For onoe, at least, the lie!
Then up speaks, at a distance,
Great London's mighty Mayor:
"Well, really now, upon my word,
I hardly call this fair;
Here's Kalmucs, and all sorts of chaps;
Flags, banners, and gold lace 1
Which things,—except at one big show,
I count most out of place!
"Yet seeing all this blaze and blare,
Makes one refleot on fate I
To institutions, worse the luck,
A smssh oomes soon or late;—
If so, oan one die better,
Than crying, 'What's the odds P'
While dining like his fathers,
And yelled at by the gods!
"Upon my word, this Russian Czar
Must feel a bit like me;
And wonder when the smash will oome,
And when the end will be.
Perhaps we shouldn't quarrel
If both our tales were told;
Our little game is just the same,
To go on as of old.
".So let him have his Tartars,
His flunkeys,—ride his horse 1
I '11 have my men in armour,
My Mace, my Tartar Sauce!
Three cheers then for his Russian show;—
Be hanged if I will soold I
The Czak,—Lohd Maiob, we're just the pair
To go on as of old I"
• • • • •
But when the question's opened,
And men have got the wit
To calmly solve all problems.
To see that all things fit;
When the nations of the future
All their nobler instincts rouse,
And the peoples have grown civil
As the despots make their bows;
When the gimcraok of mere pageant,
And the deeper moral gloom
Have, with rotten things that perish,
Gone for ever to their doom;
Half in soorn and half in laughter
Will the story still be told
How a Czar was crowned at Moscow
Like his ancestors of old I

EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Souse of Commons, Monday, May 21.—Business resumed to-day
after Whitaun recess. Many of oar young men, including oar Grand
Old One, absent.
Telegram from Randolph, dated "Clonnabally, Co. Antrim,
Monday. Sha'n't be in House till Thursday. Here making inqui-
ries into case mentioned by Joseph Oillis as to Adjutant who drew
forage allowance for imaginary horse. Most important. Joseph
sot accurate in details, but quite enough to damage Government.
Fancy we shall turn them out this time. Could have been back
to-day, but since Gladstone stays till Thursday, think Gorst will
be able to manage, and keep in order Staffy and H. VV. Smith- or
is it ' \Y. H.'f" Indefatigable young man, Randolph. Always
at his country's call.
Spent drowsy evening on Civil Service Estimates. Gorst did his
best to make up for Randolph; hut a little heavy and monotonous.
His tactics consist ehietiy of going out for an hour or so, coming
back, noting who is absent from Treasury Bench, then, when oulprit
returns, dropping down upon him; or if he prolongs absence, gets up
and wants to know how votes for furniture in Law Courts are to be
taken in absence of Secretary of State for War, or why the President
of the Board of Trade should be absent at a time when Committee
are asked to vote salary for the Charwoman at the Admiralty?
Little of this goes a long way, and we had a good deal of it a fort
night baok when Gorst protested against discussing the Transvaal
affairs in absence of Attorney-General for Ireland.
"Worst of man with a flux of speech and dearth of ideas is that
when he gets hold of what he thinks is a point he bores people to
death with it." So Habcocri says, and don't know anyone of more
judicial mind.
Joseph Gilt.is in great form. Doubts very much whether the
Patents Bill will get through this SessioD, and la highly sarcastic on
frescoes.
"When I was in Parry," he says, unflinchingly facing reoolleotions
that some might think painful, "I took my dejernay occasionally
ally fresky in the Buy. Bat there you got something to eat and
drmk. These here ireskies lor a wall I don't hold with, and if Sir
Fkkdebick Lsighton wants to do 'em, let him do 'em at his own
expense." Business done.—Voted Supply.
Tuesday.-— House in pretty oheerf ul mood to-night. Arranged for
Count Out before dinner, and whole holiday for to-morrow. Gloom
of Sir Herbert MaXwall, Bart, in Btrong contrast to general
hilarity.
"Toby," said the unfortunate Nobleman, whom I found languish-
ing in arm-chair in Library, "what makes me unhappy is that now,
as 1 sit here, 1 recall quite easily all the good things i was going to
say in moving the Adjournment. Chaplin would have been nowhere.
LoWTBXB would have been lost, and Dick Powbb not in it. Meant
to show them that if a Scotchman can't readily take in joke, he oan
turn 'em out without apparent effort. But got into such a terrible
funk when found myself on my legs. All the jokes got mixed up.
Afraid that would happen when took Arthur Bauoub's advice.
Left my own place, and spoke from Randolph's. 'Elijah's mantle,
you know,' Balfour said. 'You stand there, and you won't feel
bashful.' But think strange place even made me worse. Had
uncomfortable sense that House could see my boots. Nothing matter
with them, doncha know, bat when I speak from usual place, have
a bench before me. Hides a bit of you, and you can lean on baok if
Jou feel ill. Speaking from Randolph's seat, one is in full view of
louse. Makes fellow feel queer. Wish 1 'd had nothing to do with
it. Must get a Welshman next time."
"Yes," I Bay, touohed by unhappy Nobleman's despair; "we'll
get Morgan Lloyd next year, then your failure will be forgotten."
- On the whole, not a very lively business. Oddest men appeared
in what was expected to be funniment. "Like tragedy-men
ooming forward when the call-boy summons the comedians," said
Mr. Labouchrrk, who knows something about theatres. When
Sir Edward Colebhook rose, House positively gasped, then oon-
tumeliously roared. The storm grew higher when red face and
round body of James Howabd discovered below the Gangway.
"Highly irregular this," said Stuart-Wobtlbt. "It's like the
snn rising in the middle of the night."
Howard not at all unlike oomio pictures of the sun, as he stands
below the Gangway with full broad face shining on uproarious
crowd. Apparently nothing particular to say, and after strnggling
with clouds of displeasure, finally suffered eclipse, and solar system
resumes ordinary conditions. Business done.—House deoided by 185
votes against 85 to go to the Derby.
Thursday.—Great eruption of white hats and light clothing to-day,
Mr. Monk a little out of it. For many Sessions, so Mr. Dillwtk
tells me, he used to be the harbinger of summer. Possessed suit of
olothes of dusty miller order with white hat to match. One day
whilst House was engaged on Questions or Notices, Monk would
enter arrayed in these garments. Then House knew summer was at
handj and Members going home hunted up their white hats and light
clothing. "Just like Gentlemen who live in the country write to the
Times when they see first swallow or hear the cuckoo, so," Diixwyrt
says, "we knew when summer was at hand by seeing Monk come in
as though he had passed through a flour-mill on the way."
To-day summer burst upon us without re-appearanoe of swallow
or warning note of ouckoo. Troubled with approaching disfran-
chisement of Gloucester, or from some other cause—"Perhaps,"
Mr. Barran says, "the suit's worn out. Can't have come from
first-class firm "—Monk manque, and here we are in midsummer.
"Yes, Tobt, dear boy," says Randolph, "and the dog-days are
at hand when some people are muzzled."
One or two men laugh, sure I don't know what at.
Warlike night in Committee of Supply. Militia oat, and the
Yeomanry Cavalry paraded. Earl Percy on the war-path. Imposing

MY UNEARNED IN-
CREMENT.
[Ballad by a Betting-Man.)
A livino by exertion

It would be my aversion
Suppose it could be done.
I wish that I wai thriving
In clover upon rent,
And from estate deriving
The " unearned increment."
No increment, not any,
Sack I of Buch a kind.
Whene'er I pay a penny,
A decrement I find.
What means to raise a sum by?
No go more money lent,
Must either work, or come by
Some " unearned increment."
By toiling and by spinning,
No good care I to get;
Brads I go in for winning.
My business is to bet.
True, one must study betting,
To count upon the event;
But that's next best to netting
An 1' unearned increment."
Why, though I don't like labour,
Commit a folly, still,
By grabbing from my neighbour
His goods against his will?
'Tis safe as well as pleasant
To be a sporting gent,
And play, like me at present,
For " unearned increment."

My dear Chief Justice, you

you forgot the rule absolute

with you in deciding to grant a

big mistake. While addressing
your Lordship on this subject, I

the very breath of an Actor's life

THE HISTORY OE THE NEXT WAR.
Preliminary Chapter.
The Energetio Veteran hurried from Pall Mall, passed through
Leicester Square, skirted Covent Garden Market, and stopped at a
door under the portioo near Drury Lane. It was a small door, and
a number of persons of both sexes were hanging listlessly about in
its olose proximity. The Energetio Veteran pushed his way in, and
was stopped by a Polite Official.
"You cannot pass here, Sir," said the doorkeeper, firmly but
respectfully.
'" But I tell you I must," replied the Energetic Veteran, briskly.
"I want to see Mr. "And he mentioned one of the best-known
names in Europe.
"I have no doubt you do, Sir," returned the Official; "but the
Governor is extremely busy, and you had better write to him."
"I have written to him," oried the Energetio Veteran; "and see,
there is a oopy of my letter." And he pointed to a placard, about
eighteen feet square, whioh was adorning an adjacent wall.
Indeed, Sir 1" replied the Polite Official, with increased respeot.
"Then, if you will give me your card, Sir, possibly the Governor
will make an exoeption in your case. I can but take it to him."
The Energetio Veteran haughtily tossed over a small square of
pasteboard, and retired. When the Official returned, he found his
visitor contemplating, with the greatest possible admiration, a
gigantio poster^ representing a hand-to-hand encounter between
Egypl
gyptians and English soldiers, of the most sanguinary description.
Ah! it does so bring it back to me 1" murmured the Energetii
,'eteran, overcome with emotion. "That officer waving the British
flag, and slaughtering half-a-dozen white-coats, might have been
meant for myself. Just the sort of thing I used to do, in a leisure
moment, when I wasn't wanted to work on the Staff!"
The Polite Official respectfully beokoned the speaker to enter the
building, and together they passed through the door. They tra-
versed dark passages dimly illuminated by wire-globed gas-lights,
and ascended narrow staircases overlooking a huge open spaoe with
a boarded floor. Then they came to a second door, but this was
made of the most oostly marquetry, studded with the rarest marbles.
The Polite Official ushered in the Energetio Veteran, and retired.
"Pardon me," said a gracefully-rounded figure resting in a tissue-
of-gold dressing-gown tastefully trimmed with brilliants, on a sofa
whose bullion-cloth and pure golden legs were half hidden by a huge
rug made entirely of sable-tails. "Pardon me a moment, until I
have given my final instructions to a dozen and a half of my Secre-
taries."
The Energetio Veteran nodded amiably, and looked round him.
The chamber in whioh he was now seated was certainly gorgeous in
the extreme, and stronirly reminded him of the most luxurious pas-
sages of the Arabian Night*. The walls were hung with a material
composed of silver thread and preoious gems, and all the furni-
ture, except the sofa already mentioned, was made of the rarest
porcelain. He himself was resting on a Dresden china chair. Pic-
tures by Raffaelle, and Masters nearly as celebrated, were scattered
about the apartment in great profusion, waiting to be hung. There
was an indescribable air of wealth about the place, which had its
effect upon the visitor, although that visitor was not a man easily-
impressed.
And now," said the figure on the sofa, who had been called by
the Polite Official "the Governor," turning round and making a
cigarette out of some Turkish tobacco and a ten-pound note, "What
can I do for you?"
"I have an idea!" was the short sharp response.
"Not in the least surprised," smilingly continued the other, as he
toyed with a huge pine-apple, and filled a liqueur-glass from a
magnum of Chartreuse Verte. Won't you join me?
No, thanks," returned the Energetic Veteran; "I never take
anything except at meals, and get all I want from the Vine Club, of

hastily, "but, to tell the truth, I don't think it would be of any uee
to me. _ You see, when I want to dine quietly, I generally accept an
invitation to a State banquet with the Lord Mayor. But, you were
saying you had an idea?"

"What, another letter 1" returned the other. "Well, thanks,
very much; but I think that game is played out. Besides, my
Vicar in South Kensington is getting jealous. Not that you don't
write capitally. No; when I saw that first despatch of yours—the

what is your idea?"

"Not bad," said the Governor, reflectively, "the North Pole,
though, has been touched at the Adelphi."
"Not as I should touch it!" oried the Energetie Veteran, with
enthusiasm. "I would have real bears and a battle by night, illu-
mioated with the Aurora Borealis."
"Not bad," murmured the Governor. "I don't think that has
been done."
"Then Beauchamp Seymour—tut, tut t—I should say Alcesteb,
but I never can remember the titles of these newly-made Peers-
might bombard Copenhagen, as I promised to put him into my next
big thing."
"Bombard Copenhagen!—surely that has been done before?"
"Everything has been done before," replied the Energetic
Veteran, irritably. "But, there, 1 have taken a great deal of

by-and-by, they may want something of the sort at the Princesses',

The Duke was rather in favour of an invasion of the Crimea."
"Done years and years ago!"
"So I told him, and suggested, instead, complications with the
North-Western Powers and a descent upon Greenland. You see I
had you in my eye."
"I will do it!" oried the Governor, suddenly. "I see my way
to something really big, and I will do it. I will bill your first
despatch all over the place, and the scenery shall be put in hand at
once!"
Within six months of the above conversation the world was
startled by two great events,—the firat, a fresh war in Europe, the

[June 2, 1883.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MY DERBY DAY.
I always have a book on the Derby. The amounts are not large,
bat it enables me to join with an appearance of grave anxiety in the
horsey conversation appropriate
to May. It onoe, however, nearly
got me into trouble when in the
Witness Box, my naive confes-
sion encouraging a facetious cross-
examiner to denounoe me as a
Black Leg, until the assurance
that I never went beyond a few
shillings overwhelmed him with
as much oonfusion as a sane
man can well feel when dressed
np in black stuff and horse-hair.
However, upon discovering on
Wednesday morning, on making
up my book, that, it fortunate, I
should only lose a rifle, but under no circumstanoes could I possibly
win, I determined to avoid the Saturnalia of Epsom, and to spend a
quiet day in beautiful Epping Forest. I was induced to adopt this
wise resolution from reading Lord Shekbrooke's quotation from
Milton, commencing, "As one who long in populous city pent,"
which was evidently intended for me who have been pent in a very
populous city for about fifty years.
1 strolled through the People's beautiful Forest for about four
hours in a perfect rapture of enjoyment, but I should venture to
make to the Authorities the modest suggestion, to c'ear away the
dirty paper instead of clearing away so many trees. Exhausted by
my long stroll, I sought refreshment at a cleanly-looking booth, the
property of John Smith, a name I think I have seen before, and
whn supplied me with the cup that cheers but not inebriates, with a
sufficiency of milk and sugar, for the sm ill charge of one penny.
This, with a remarkably stioky Bath bun, constituted my refreshing
and economical repast. Returning into the Forest 1 heard the notes
of a cuckoo. Always ready to contribute my share, however small,
to the constantly increasing store of human knowledge, 1 noticed
that my cuckoo never called more than eighteen times without
panting to take breath, and that his notes are separated by a fourth.
While listening intently to discover these important faots in Natural
History, my cuokoo suddenly flew past me, making as much noise as
Mr. Bkiqgs's first pheasant.
Finding myself now on the bank of the pleasant-looking lake, I
was asked if I would have a boat, but as from my earliest days I
have always liked to see which way I was going, and as I saw a
kindly intimation written up, that all damage mutt be paid for. I
bargained for a boatman as well as a boat, and spent an hour of calm
delicious enjoyment.
On landit.g I discovered a long line of Coooa-Nuts in tempting
array, and their youthful guardian slumbering peacefully. Awaking
at my approach, he besought my patronage so earnestly, that 1
yielded to the extent of one penny, and bringing into play the old
yorkers with whioh in days of yore I used to spread-eagle the
wickets of my opponents at cricket, I, quite as much to my own
astonishment as the boy's, landed a remarkably fine cocoa-nut,
which we ascertained, by violently shaking it, contained a consider-
able quantity of the peculiar milk which is accounted for in suuh a
variety of ways. Scorning to take advantage of my unexpected
success, I nobly returned the fruit to the youthful attendant, who,
when he had reoovered from his surprise, expressed his gratitude for
my unexampled liberality by at once standing on his head.
I strolled away with head erect, and wi h the consciousness of
having at one ana the same time evinced remarkable skill and great
Belf-denial. I had previously learned from the young recipient of
my bounty, that the average number of "chucks" at Cocoa-Nats
before aohieviog success is six, and of "shies" at Aunt Sally, four;
the form of our female relative's effigy presenting, apparently, a
better mark than the nubbly nut that oontains the fluid.
In the train from the City I found myself in company with a
gentleman of remarkably healthy, if not flushed, appearanoe, who
had just returned from Epsom. He was very oommunicative, but
many of his expressions were peculiar, if not unintelligible. He told
me, for instance, that he was down upon his luck, and should have
to trouble his Uncle. _ Upon my venturing to express the opinion
that he was fortunate in having so generous a relation to appeal to,
he laughed, and said that wasn't at all bad. As the train was about
stopping, he shook hands with me very heartily, and made use of
these very remarkable words:—"I've enjoyed your society very
much; there's a greenness about yon that is quite refreshing, so
1 '11 give you just two bits of advice. Never have anything to do
with the Turf. They are all soamps alike, and would sell their own
fathers to gain their ends. But if you can't resist it, like me,
there's only one chance for you, and that is, to Nobble the Jockey 1"

A VICEROY FOR AFRICA.
"Suppose Han Majesty were represented in South Africa by a Viceroy
carefully selected, to whom the Governors would report, with whom the Boer
Presidents would negotiate, and who would, at r. tr-.rd* natives, pistes* all
the authority the Grown and Parliament oould give him. Wielding such
powers, * • • he would, we conceive, be able to remove, and frequently
even to anticipate, difficulties which press severely on the Colonial Office."
Spectator.
As T've just been appointed first Viceroy and Governor-General of
the Cape Colony, Natal, Pondoland, Basutoland, Griqualand West,
Bechuanaland, and as much of Zululand as we haven't yet given
back to Cetewayo, must buy good map of South Africa at once, and
study the numerous interesting (geographical) problems connected
with that country. Must also discover, if possible, before starting,
who Langalibalele is. Is it the African native appellation for
Bishop Colenso? Wonder if Foksteb. would put me up to this.
He seems to know all about the Bechuana«, and might help a
"carefully-Beleoted Vioeroy" in acquiring information.
Here I am at Cape Towu I Find furious letter from Mayor and
chief residents at Durban, asking me why on earth I haven't settled
in their Colony instead of here. They say their oity has quite five
hundred inhabitants, and is nearly as large as any in all South
Africa.
Make my firstspeeoh. Tell people I already feel " an Africander
to the baokbone." People cheer. Don't like the word "Africander";
too obviously rhymes with "gander." But ought I to make publio
speeches f Shall telegraph to Ripon, I think, and ask advice.
Dutchman in crowd wants to know " my opinion on the Transvaal
question." Tell him I haven't formed one yet, but hope to do so in
the course of a day or two. Dutchman Beems surprised. Another
person.—looks like an English clergyman in disguise—says he's a
great friend of Joel and Jonathan, and would be glad to know if
I'm going to let 'em be "eaten up" by Letsie and Masupha?
Natural for clergyman in disguise to feel hurt about men called
Joel, or Jonathan; but why these scriptural names out here?
Contuses my geography utterly.
Well, this is really quite aggravating! After several days spent
in trying to induce Boers, by diplomatic efforts to spare the Be-
chuanas, I now hear that they've taken all their cattle and wives,
and added their territory to what they choose to call the "Dutch
South African Republic"
Evidently, mnst follow "consistent polioy." For a "supreme
referee, on the spot, placed above the strife of parties, is always
necessary in Buch circumstances." Quite feel that I'm necessary.
Wonder why poor Baetlk Fkekb didn't succeed. But then he was
only Governor of the Cape. Now, / am also Governor of Natal,
Zululand, Bechuanaland, &c, and also Vice-Suzerain of the Trans-
vaal. So that, of course, makes my position ever so much easier than
poor old Bartle Fhehe's.
Cape Parliament has developed a spirit of its own! Refuses
to vote supplies if I send army into Transvaal. Threatening;
telegrams from Natal, Baying that if I don't, they will declare
themselves independent of England altogether, and of me, too!
This is an undeniably awkward situation. Must temporise.
Happy Thought. Get dear old Cetewayo to attack Boers. Do
so. After a week, hear that he's been completely defeated by the
Dutch brutes, and, in consequence, has accepted position of their
Suzerain. Cape Parliament is becoming unbearable, Natal has really
deolared its independence, and the united Dutchmen of Transvaal
and Orange Free Stat* are marching on Cape Town I Resign my
risition, and perform my own " happv despatch " to England, where
can, at all events, give Colonial Office some of the local know-
ledge " which it so much needs.

Punch pops the speotaoles across his nose,
As through each magic lens his keen eyes twinkle,
Shadows of eld upon him orowd and close,
He feels a spiritual Rip Van Winkle.
Is this the England of the Sage's youth,
This crotchet-ridden realm of topsy-turvy?
That parti-coloured Patch—can it be Truth?
That Liberty, in vesture strait and scurvy?
The very air's asphyxia to the lungs
Used to the rapture of free inspiration.

Each seems to be half tyrant and half truckler.

Pooh—pooh I The old Palladium stands no longer
Midmost the city's oitadel. The whine
Of philanthropic cant has proved far stronger
Than manly-fronted and frank-heaited sense.
The one and indivisible birthright, Freedom,
blind
Has been exchanged by babblers dull and dense
For pottage-doles, and every little Edom
Has its own local spoon. The old large, divine
"Thou shilt not" has been narrowed down'and
whittled,
At hest of every crotchet-monger's whine,
Until Morality itself's belittled
Into pure priggishness, the sour and tame
Subservience of small souls to little shackles.

Bound Ehodian rhetoricians thus made rife
The rule of this new tyrant Bmall and shabby?
Have Grand—but oft Grandmotherly—Old Men
Nervelessly yielded to the newest fashion
Of mobcap tyranny? The Punchian pen
Must lay effectively a scathing lash on
The hacks invertebrate that bend and bow
To the first gu^h-rush of fanatio folly
As the Vox pvpuli. Good faith! I trow
Life trill be oreezy. rational, most jolly,
When England is a Heptarchy of fads,
A chaos of crass crotchets—when the noodles,
Tories, or Liberals, or roaring RadB,
Change men from freemen into chain-led poodles;
When one may spread a pestilence, but not
Unchallenged make the best of Nature's bounties.
When he who'd drink or smoke must scheme and
plot,
And travel into different towns and counties
To dodge the local despot; when the Law
Piecemeal is parcelled out with petty pother,
So that 'tis no high Mentor striking awe,
But a Dame Part let, full of fuss and bother,
Hanging at each man's heels until he doubt
If he may smile or sneeze without authority,
Or yield to any wish or want without
Speoial permission from some one " Majority"
Out of a hundred such.
Punch dashes off
The Magic Spectacles with mighty vigour.
But is it matter for mere careless scoff
This dream of Crotohetdom's caprioious rigour?
Is life's large freedom to become the prey
Of zealous zanies, shallow, sour, ascetic?
The Glasses may not show the truth to-day,
But there's one question yet,—are they prophetic t
The Ministry and the Mint.
It is rumoured that the Cabinet, on consideration,

Leaves, for awhile, some corner, object of huckster hope.
Maybe a burial plot, where the dead no more seek resting,
Lit with a touch of green, else sombre and void and waste;
Maybe a grassless patch which Trade in its eager questing
Leaves for a little time unsnatched by its greedy haste,
Dull, and dirty, and damp, shard-strewn and rubbish-cumbered;
Yet there is room to breathe, even to romp and run.
Few, and growingly few, are these City waste nooks numbered;
Shall they be all greed-swallowed, or rescued for health and fun?
Health and joy of the children! What if they, sadly staring
Saw a vision of Spring break through the grey of the nook,
A figure of grace and gladness, vesture of verdure wearing.
Bringing in voice vague echoes of musio of bird and brook!
What if a bright Spring shower of buds and blooms she sprinkled
.Down on the waste before them, there as they cluster and cower,
Signs of the sunny meadows with shimmering dew-blobs sprinkled,
Whiff of the nutty hawthorn, scent of the lilac-flower!
Fancy? Verily, yes. Yet that waste might win as verily
Touoh of the soft Spring fingers, sound of the sweet Spring voice.
There where the children sigh might their laughter echo merrily,
There in some show of Summer the waifs of the town rejoice.
Room for such Ru$ in urbe daily hourly narrows,
Nature nooked into neatness is better than none at all.
Trim straight walks, Bmug grass-plots, shrubs, and the chirrupping
sparrows!
Yes; but space for scampering, scope for the flying ball.
Look to it, Sages, Senators! See to it, souls unsordid,
Snatch whilst there's aught to snatch ungulped by the gorge of
Trade,
Ere each scanty plot is paled, and each little waste patch hoarded,
And Railway I rattle and choke where the children might have played.
MR. PUNCH'S METROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENT ACTS.
To clear away the Holywell Street block.
To make a clean sweep of Seven Dials.
To demolish the block opposite the Criterion, and make a clear
way to Leicester Square.
To open out Leicester Square, leaving the Alhambra and the
Pandora (when opened) Theatres.
To enlarge the area of Covent Garden Market, and restrict the sale.
To establish several Flower Markets.
To establish Fruit and Vegetable Markets.
To build Restaurants on the Thames Embankment, which could be
turned into Winter Garden dining-places.
To open Kensington Gardens to Equestrians, making rides after
the manner of those in the Hois de Boulogne.
To erect a central Sea-Water Bathing Establishment.
To make as many open spaces as possible in the Eastern suburbs.
To compel all dust-carts, &c, to work between 4 and 7 a.m. , and
then disappear. Coal-carts the same.
Sub-Tramways everywhere for all heavy waggons.
Dynamite might be legitimately and safely used to clear the
atmosphere of fog.
On every lamp-glass the number of the house facing it.
The name of each street to be legibly printed at the corner of every
block, at a certain height, and not sky'j.
These will do to begin with.
A Sportsman on Rational Dress.
They may talk as they like about health, warmth, and grace,
But he with plain reason is surely a player
Who solemnly talks of improving the race,
By making the sex a non-stayer!
The Erhington Affair.—Lord Houghton explained last week
that "onoe upon a time" he had gone on an Erring-and-straying-
ton Roaming Mission. Yes, but that Mission was a regular h'out-
an'-h'out 'un.

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

THE WESTMINSTER WAX-WORKS.
Monday Night, May 28.—Pleasant to hear Scotch accent again.
Since the Herring Brand Question was settled, and the Hypothec
Bill passed, don't have fair proportion of it. Began the evening,
of course, -with Ireland, and threatened to conclude with it. Mr.
Habbinoton, one of the latest gifts from that fruitful isle, has in
usual way secured opportunity of making himself a personage,
and, naturally, not inclined to let it sleep. Has done everything
to qualify himself for prominence. Has been in prison, owns a
newspaper, and is always ready to challenge Government to do its
worst. Since a paper that no one ever heard of before has been
seized by local police in connection with printing of seditious
matter, Harrington has been constantly popping up, and demand-
ing to be led out to instant execution. "I am ready for any course
the Chief Secretary will take," he says, gloomily, in imitation, longo
intervallo, of John Dillon.
The course Trkvelyan obviously inclined to take is severely to let
him alone, which greatly grieves the dauntless Harrington. Will
no one behead him on Tower Hill, hang him from the Clooktower, or
at least send him to prison somewhere in the neighbourhood of a
good eating-house?
"No one, I regret to say," Mr. Labouciiere replies in his incisive
tones. "You're a decidedly uninteresting person. Though you
have the fluency of an Irishman, you 're as dull as a Scotchman, as
commonplace as a Welshman, and as unpicturesque as an English-
man."
It was Mr. Ramsay's voice that was heard at midnight, complain-
ing about subvention of disturnpiked roads. "Not enough I " he
cries; so moves rejection of the lot. Consternation on part of
Scotch Members.
"A people," says Mr. Jakes Lowther, "who are so economical
that they go about in kilts to save the cost of trouser-cloth, won't
stand it."
Nor did they. Quite a storm burst around the placid head of Mr.
Ramsay. With many a " Hoot, mon I" and "Hech, Sandy I" he
was reminded that half a loaf is better than no bread. Ramsay
Borne time in seeing it; when finally grasped the idea, proposed with
great stolidity to withdraw his Motion. But Joseph Gillis had to
be reckoned with. Here was a fine chance of harrying the Soots,
and wasting a quarter of an hour. So when question put that leave
be given to withdraw Motion, J. B. said "No!" and Committee
divided.
Pretty to see Mr. Ramsay walking out to support the Vote he had
earlier moved the rejection of, weighed down by consciousness that
he had nearly lost £20,000 for Scotland.
Business done.—A few Votes in Supply.
Tuesday.—"Didn't see you at our May Meeting at the Foreign
Office this morning, Cowen," Sir W. Lawson said to the gentle
Joseph of Newcastle.
"May Meeting, do you call it P" said J. C, carefully brushing
the nap of his new silk hat, and adjusting his lavender silk necktie.
"Must Meeting is a better name for a gathering where Gladstone
talks to you Liberals. I'm an Independent Member, who hates
Caucuses of any kind, whether at Newcastle or the Foreign Office.
I own no compulsion but that of opposing whatever Gladstone may
recommend." And, ilioking with odour-laden oambric handkerchief
a speck of dust from his patent-leather bhoes, the Northumbrian
daintily pioked his way through the throng.
_ " Most extraordinary man, Joe Cowen, said Sir Wilfltd, pen-
sively regarding his retreating figure. Knows every conspirator
in Europe. Has lent money to them all, and regularly pensions
thirty-three seedy-looking fellows who, at various times, have
knocked him up in the dead of the night, and, cautiously removing
their orape masks, whispered in his ear that they had spoken disre-
spectfully of the Czar, are fleeing for their lives, and have not got a
kopec Strongly suspect they chiefly come from the East-End, where
the Hairy Man, the Sioux Chief, and the Tameless Savage of the
Mid-African Jungle are cultivated." Truly Joseph has a gentle
heart, and an ear always open to human distress.
May Meeting went off very well this morning. Party more united
than ever. Everything going to be carried exoept the Government
of London BUI. Thereupon, the brothers Lawrence publicly fall
into eaoh other's arms. Alderman 'Fowler and Sir Andrew Lusk
perform a breakdown. Firth fumes. Sir Gabriel Goldney, whose
son is something in the City, tells me Lord Mayor Knight is woe-
fully out np.
"Thought I was going to be the Last of the Lord Mayors," he
gloomily confided to the Baronet Gabbiel. "Fact is, had given
orders to be painted in act of leaving Mansion House for last time.
Great historical picture to be presented to the nation. 'The Last of
the Lord Mayors saying Good Knight to his Office.' Bound to take
portrait off Artist's hands; must alter inscription."
Cavendish Bentinck in high spirits. Seems he holds brief in
the Belt Case, and had great triumph to-day.
"They went on reading the Judge's summing-up for dayB,"
says he. "L.C.J, took a turn, Denman read himself hoarse, and
Manisty lost his voice. Still they went on. Prospeot intolerable.
Thing might last for a fortnight. Then I volunteered to read.
Hadn't been at it half-an-hour when L.C.J, lays his head on the
Benoh; Manisty moans; Denman droops. Ten minutes, later,
L.C.J, desperately interposes. Can't stand any more of it. Agree
to take rest as read, and I go off in triumph. Pity I was born to be
a Minister, Toby. Would nave made my fortune at the Bar."
Business done.—Agricultural Holdings Bill read a Second Time.
Thursday Night.—The remarkable number of recent resigna-
tions by Irish Members explained to-night. Been explained before
by persons who know everything. Said Land League funds stopped.
No more expenses forthcoming; gentlemen resident at West-
minster Palace Hotel expected to pay their own bills. But Irish

Members very proud. Rather than do that, Rive up their seats.
That explanation generally accepted. Real faet only now come
ont. It's The O'Kkllt. Very last time Gabatt Bybke was in the
House he made mysterious communication to me.
"Did ye ever live in a house with a Tiger, Toby?" says he.
Confess I never had. What was it like r Was it agreeable, or
was the excitement too strained, and
apprehension of acoident too absorbing?
"Well, I have," Mr. Bybhk con-
tinued, in pursuit of his own question,
"since 1880 that's been my state. All
very well for Pabkell to keep a watch-
dog; but to have a fellow going about
with pistols glaring upon you, so that
you tremble every time you get up to
speak, and never go home without expect-
ing to find 'a friend' waiting for you, is
more than I can stand."
Mr. Byrne's language a little mixed,
but evidently disturbed with somethinfr,
and has since resigned, like half-a-dozen
others of the stouter and more peaceful
members of the Party. Now The O'Kelly
has fixed upon McCoan, and O'Bbif.n
has acted the part of a friend. Joski
Oillis, when he heard of the event,
called on Mr. McCoan, and generously
laying aside all differences (J. O. once
publicly called him a carpet-bagger)
offered to conduct negotiations with
O'Kelly's friend. But McCoak, to the
infinite disgust of Joseph Oillis, refused
overtures. "When I levanted, I eame
here for a peaceful life," he said. "A _
man who might have been bowstrung by instructions of the Scltait,
won't stand to be shot at by an Irish Member."
Decided to tell House all about it. House roared with laughter.
Only The O'Gorman Mauox sat stern and silent, with a dark cloud
on his massive brow.
"I have lived too long to see this day," the amphibious old
warrior murmured. "But, thank Heaven, ne's half a Scotchman.
The O'Kelly's an honour to us. I '11 go and take a drink wid
him."
.."It's a pity they didn't fight it out!" says Dick Powek.
"They should have had a duel

one that happened somewhere

dark. Each man clutching a
braoe of pistols. One, terrible

Sad news to-night. Tragedy comes treading on skirts of broadest
Farce. General Bubhaby is dead—dead just past his prime. K iso-
la k k has a glowing page, telling how at Inkermann Bursary, then a
stripling, charged through the serried masses of the Russians at the
head of a handful of the Grenadier Guards, and did much to retrieve
the fortunes of the day. In him the Army loses one of its bravest
Captains, and the House of Commons the companionship of a loyal
and simple-hearted Gentleman.
Business done— Passed eighteen Votes in Committee of Supply.
Friday Night.—The O'Kelly fizzle went out very mildly. Fire-
Eater explains that clauses of Duello Aot unfortunately not made
compulsory. He offered to shoot McCoan. McCoan didn't seem to
care about it, and there was end of matter. The O'Gobman Mahon
affected to tears. Sends his " cyard" all round the benches. "Pity
the House should be disappointed. Will no one oblige?" No one
will, and the Ancient Warrior by Sea and Land stalks forth, making
passes at imaginary adversary.

CITY INTELLIGENCE.
A considerable amount of excitement was witnessed on the
Stock Exchange on Wednesday last on its becoming known that the
Government had decided to postpone the London Government Bill.
The very valuable Stock issued by the important State of Honduras,
whose prinoipal export consists of fine lively Turtle, had fluctuated
considerably during the uncertainty that existed in regard to the
above Bill, but when it was known that the old Corporation would
remain unreformed and unmolested, the price of this valuable secu-
rity steadily rose, and, after some slight fluctuations, olosed at
3-8ths to 5-8ths buyers.
The demand for the fine lively Turtle above alluded to, became so
lively at the Leadenhall Depdt during the course of the day, that it
was rumoured that some of the taverns had to resort to the shameful
practice of substituting Irish Conger-Eel until a fresh arrival of the
genuine article restored peaoe and comfort to many a corporation.
Perhaps even Sir William Harcourt, with all his Statesmanlike
grasp of his subject, little thought how his rash project of reform
would affect the price of so valuable an investment as that of
Honduras Bonds.
H.R.H. the Prince of Wales dined with his Brother Benchers at
the Middle Temple last Wednesday. The Festive Night Templars were
ever celebrated for their Hospitality. On reading the list of names,
Sir Arthur Sullivan, who made his first appearance here on this
occasion, remarked that there were so many " Masters" present, it
sounded like a juvenile party without any Misses. For ourselves,
we back the Middle Temple against Hampton Court or the National
Gallery for possessing the finest Collection of Old Masters in the
world. And young 'uns, too.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Getting into the Swing of it.
LE CHEMIN DU PARODY POUR TOOLE MONDE.
The Haymarket Fedora could not have a better advertisement than
the Stage-Dora at Toole's Theatre. To thoroughly appreciate the latter,
it is absolutely necessary
to have seen the former.
The odd part of it—
there are several odd
parts, but this is the one
par excellence—is that a
comparatively unknown
young Actress, Miss
Linden, by closely
studying Mrs. Bernard
Beere's performance of
Fedora, has given us an
imitation which recalls
Saba Bernhardt far
more vividly than it
does Mrs. B. Beebe at
the Haymarket. Of
course, this only shows
what comparatively easy
work copying an original
is to a painstaking in-
telligent Artist; and it
also shows how cleverly
close must have been Mrs.
Bsere's reproduction.
The faculty of imitation
is more or less common,
but to give the imitation that subtle touch of humour which turns a
portrait into a caricature is a rare gift.
As to whether a piece like Fedora should be an object of travesty,
and whether one Actor should give a laughable presentment of
another, the Orientals have one perfect word in answer to all
such considerations urged by a few "very superior persons,"
and that is the monosyllable, " Bosh I" Of course, the object of
caricature must be very well known to the public, ana even
generally popular, to give any relish to the humour. Don't we all
ohuokle at seeing the tricks and manners of our best friends
comically imitated? It does not detract from our estimate of a friend's
worth to see absurd prominence given to his peculiarities. There is
no malice in it, though the mischief-maker of course insinuates that
there is. Judicious admirers of Mr. Irving, for example, will be
amused by a genuinely good imitation of their favourite Aotor's
mannerisms; and it will _ even add a zest to their enjoyment
when they see him again in the part. It is only one step from
the Sublime to the Ridiculous; and were the Sublime to exagge-
rate, he would at once render himself Ridiculous. Against
the danger of exaggeration the really humorous caricature is a
warning.
As to the weak points of the original play, as we have already
said in our notice of it, Fedora will not stand ten minutes' serious
consideration; but it is a proof of Sakdotj's genius that he risked
everything for the sake of Saba: he kept his eye on Saba, and
Saba pulled him through.
_ That Lorit Ipanoff should have been totally ignorant of the rela-
tions between Fedora and Vladimir is absurd; but without this
improbable hypothesis the play could not go on. Then Sabdou's
devioe is so evident, as to be even clumsy, when at the end of
Act II. Lorit defers his information until the evening; for other-
wise we should not have had the situation of danger made by Gretch
and his police waiting for him in the back garden.
Again, in Act III., when Fedora finds she has made a mistake,
and that Lorit is innocent, why can she not step out, or run to
Marka her maid (who was one of those charged to obey Gretch
implicitly, and to remain dressed on her bed all night, to be " left
till called for "), and tell her to summon Gretch, explain the matter
to him, send the police away, and let Lorit go quietly and respect-
ably home to his own lodgings?
And again, as Fedora is in confidential communication with the
Russian Government, why, when she finds Lorit is innooent, does
she not send a wire to announce the fact, adding " letter to follow "?
In the sixth week of the French Plays at the Gaiety, Saba herself
is announced to appear as Fedora. Two Richmonds in the field.;—
but if it is only real July weather, an extra Richmond will be
delightful.
Mr. Wabbe made a hit as Jean Bancroft de Siriex, and Mr. Toole
looked like the sort of Vanity Fair caricature that Signor Carlo
Pellkgrini would make of Mr. Coghlan. "When Lorit spoke, how-
ever, there was no doubt about his identity, and he was J. L. Toole
and no one else.
As he leaves London for his provincial tour at the end of this
month, Stage-Dora, or, Who Killed Cock Robin— (a better title, if

Warde is it?
Miss Linden were as diaphanous as Saba of former days, might
have been Ill-Fed Dora—will have a short life but a merry one in
Town. Mr. Toole will give her a run in the
Country, and bring her up to London again
if t'other Fedora is still going on at the
Haymarket, of which there seems at present
to be every ohance.
The New Opera at Covent Garden.—We
must defer our illustrated notes of this new
work till next week, as our Artist was so
upset by the " business" of one of the Acts,
where all the people play at being at sea,
and swing forwards and backwards in such
an unpleasantly suggestive manner, that,
being of a delicate organisation, he rose
from his seat, staggered along Fop's Alley
to the door, nearly fell down the companion,
addressed the Stall-keeper as "Steward!"
yelled for brandy immediately, and did not
turn up again—we use the phrase advisedly
—the whole evening. So we were left alone
in our glory, to be nearly stunned by the
shouting on the stage, and the fortittimo
orchestra.
The Opera—in whicn we ought to take a family interest, as the
music is by Signor Ponchlnello, or Ponchtello, to a libretto by
one "Tobia Gobbio "—clearly a sly dog, and a connection of Toby—
is emphatically a stunner. We fanoy it will be popular. The style
reminds us of Vkhdi, and the translation of the libretto is decidedly
Wordy. There is plenty of melody in the Opera, but whether it is
our kinsman Pobchinello'b, or not, we, who are perfectly impar-
tial, cannot at a first hearing decide.
The music, generally, struck us as being so far like the name of
"Smith "that we had a sort of recollection of having heard [it
somewhere before.
The plot is slightly idiotio, and the situations are hackneyed and
stagey. Madame Durand oan act as well as sing. The translator
of the libretto, instead of giving us a commonplace English prose
equivalent, has attempted a little operatic poetry on his own account,
to whioh anyone, when oppressed by the Opera, can gratefully turn.
We have only time and space for one extract this week, which shall
be the finish; and we ass our readers, who have not yet seen La
Gioconda, to tell us what kind of an Opera they fanoy it is from the
specimen which winds up the entire work:—
Giaconda "stabs herself with the dagger that she had furtively secreted
while adorning herself, and falls dead, as if lightning-struck."
"Furtively tecreted" is good. If she didn't secrete it furtively,
how could she have secreted it all? Openly P
"As if lightning-struck " is terrific as a stage-direction.
Then Barnaba, the villain of the Opera, says, or sings—
"Ah, stay thee! 'tis a jest! Well,
Then, thou shalt hear this,
And die ever damned!"
Why "thee" and "thou" should be used passes our compre-
hension, as Barnaba most decidedly is not a member of the Society
of Friends. But the Translator-Poet loves quakerisms .throughout.
Then Barnaba,—very bad man, Barnaba,—
"Bending over the corpse of Giaconda, and screaming furiously into her
ear"—
[" Screaming furiously" is quite in accordance with the previous
style of the Opera]—gives her, dead or not, the following startling
information by way of finale .—

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FESTIVE SALE.
It is not often that such a
chance occurs of acquiring; a
really miscellaneous assemblage
of property as that afforded by
an individual at Newton Abbot,
in Devonshire, who advertises this
unique collection in the Western
Times.
Do you want twelve fireproof
safes,—here you are, though one,
or at most two, would be enough
for the majority of people. Do
you desire a wrought-iron six-
panelled door with bolts and
jambs all complete, to put before
the safes, we suppose,- here you
are. Do you wish for sixty copper
furnaces, they are ready for you.
Do you long for thirty new and
secondhand kitchen-stoves, this
generous man will sell them to
you. Do you hanker after iron-
work for an oven, it is ready for
you. Do you look with envy on
the possessor of market-traps—
here are two, doubtless cheap.
Have you long wished for a hand-
some carriage and two sets of
harness, this benefaotor of his
race has them on sale.
Above all, does your soul yearn
for a set of false teeth, as all
sympathetic souls do sometimes,
here thev are advertised by this
genuine Philanthropist, and such
a great and good man will, we
feel certain, be at the trifling
expense of making them fit for
you.
Bnt that is not all. A bonne
bouche remains, concerning which
we can say nothing, for it speaks
for itself. After using the safes,
fastening the door, roasting in
the furnaces and stoves, driving
the traps and carriages, fitting
the harness on, and putting in
the set of false teeth, the adver-
tiser offers you a secondhand
saw-pit!
Don't all go to Newton Abbot
at once.

OUR OFFISHIA.L GUIDE.
Pabt III.—Great Britain.
Those who peruse the excellent introduction to the bulky shilling
catalogue of the great show, by Mr. Herbert Then dell, cannot but
be struck by the lofty object the promoters of the Exhibition seem to
have had in view from the incubation of their praiseworthy enter-
prise. We are told that they wished " to defend the natural wealth
of our rivers and seas from the rapacity of greed and the reckless-
ness of pollution, to provide improved harbour accommodation and
greater facilities for transport and commerce, to render the meals of
the million more palatable, more wholesome, and, at the same time,
more economical.' "But all these tilings," they observe, through
their eloquent spokesman, "sink into insignificance when compared
with the safe-guarding of our fishermen's lives and the improvement
of our fishermen's homes." Knowing thus with what philanthropic
aspirations the promoters commenced their labours, it is a little dis-
appointing to find the principal and unquestionably most popular
exhibit which attracts attention on leaving the grand entrance hall
is a case full of salad bowls, fish knives and forks, and cruet stands,
made chiefly from the claw of the boiled lobster. It is also a trifle
unsatisfactory to discover that, in a display so firmly intended to
benefit the human race, a box containing a feather cloak, gratefully
presented to Lady Brasset by some semi-cannibal potentate, has
more interest in the eyes of the Public than " Division I., No. 1. A
plaited herring-net, made by machinery." Still the British Sea
Fishing, whioh monopolises no less than eighty pages of the Guide,
has a certain sort of attractiveness whioh usually finds vent in the
exclamation of a more than usually intellectual visitor of "not half
bad, but which is the way to the band P" Of course, it would be
impossible to notice all the many useful little articles displayed in
the fifty divisions devoted to Great Britain. However, a few may
be pioked out for special mention:—
No. 87. "Steam Life-boat. Constructed not only to save life, but,
from its great buoyancy [obtained by many revolving air-tight
rollers acting as propellers), will help to support a ship from sinking,
and tow same into port. The life-boat contains a large space for
salvage, 8fc, also, when at anchor, would serve as a revolving light-
ship." Thus far the official catalogue. However, to the thoughtful
it must be obvious that this excellent vessel may be applied to many
other purposes. With its carriage it could be used as an admirable
Brompton and Islington omnibus. Turned upside down, it would
make a pleasant hut for a pic-nic party in a storm. Standing on its
stern, it could easily be altered into a Punch and Judy Show. And
at all times the boiler might be employed in cooking eggs.
No. 111. "Portable India-rubber Boats." Most useful in a
sketching expedition. When not employed in assisting at the paint-
ing of a water-colour, might be used for rubbing out superfluous
pencil-marks.
No. 114. "Patent Collapsible Boat." Capital thing for a praotical
joke.
No. 169. "Model of a Well Vessel." No doubt, in some future
exhibition, a model of the same boat will be shown when not so well
—say, when sickening for the measles, or in for the whooping-
oough.
No. 186. "Norfolk Crab Boats." Admirably adapted for
youngsters learning to row. In these vessels they may catch as
many crabs as they please.

Husband. "Oh, please yourself, my Dear; bdt I should say we've enough 'Abo about Nothing' at Home!"
No. 201. "White Manilla Boat-Tie." Very pretty. Sure to
attract considerable attention at an evening: party.
No. 211. "Collection of Rope suitable for Fishing Vessels."
Deeply interesting, but not quite bo exciting as a collection of
unsuitable rope would have been.
No. 276. ''Fog Horns, to be seen in action in the Machinery
Division." Great improvement. Much better than being heard!
These silent fog-horns might be safely used in a nursery.
No. 321. "Model of Apparatus for barking Nets by Steam." A
very different process to biting nets by electricity.
No. 364. "' Baba,' the Fish Preserver." Sounds like a novel
by Captain Mayne Reid, but isn't.
No. 374. "A Life-preserving Atmospheric Helmet and Atmos-

a joke is a joke, but what has this to do with fishing?

for Cab-making or Coach-building. As a fish always takes a fly to
save itself the trouble of swimming, fly-making must be profitable.

Mr. W. G. Cusins gives his Annual Grand Morning Concert (why
"Grand Morning"? or, as it is a hardy annual, call it the "G.O.M."

Among the genuinely great attractions named for this occasion, Mr.
Cusins "has great pleasure in announcing that Mrs. Kendal, her
first appearance at a Concert in London, has kindly consented to give
a recitation." Of course, very kind; but will the attraction be in-
tensified by its being this Actress's " first appearance at a Concert?"
It is suggestive either of an apology for condescending to a Music
Hall,—we mean a Hall of Music,—or of her being so bewildered
by her "first appearance at a Concert," as to require all the support
her friends can give her. We wish our first Cusins every success,
and trust that Mrs. Kendal (who, we believe, is Professoress of
Elocution at the It.CM.) will get over the severe trial which this
"first appearance at a Concert" will evidently be to her nervous
system.

"They ask for spirituous exoess,"said the new-comer, with a sly
twinkle in his eye; they might try a little spiritual refreshment."
The joke was new, pithy, and profoundly philosophical, and the
witty trio grasped it at once with a facility that sent them into
paroxysms of the wildest merriment.
But, as they stood at the Club window, shaken with laughter, and
holding the very balustrade for support, William Sykbs, the Mile-
End oynic, was passing by on his way East, to his hovel in
Shoreditch!
"What are them three coves a-larking their 'eads off about?" he

FROM VOL. I.
• ••**•
The distinguished Parliamentary Philanthropist laughed heartily.
"If our little Bill, my dear Lord Bishop, he continued, still
shaking with the suppressed humour that visibly infeoted him,
only becomes law, Sunday may possibly prove even a trifle less
festive and exhilarating an institution to our self-selected friend—
the Working Man—than it does at present I Still," he added, with a
cheery guffaw, "there will be at least the streets to fall back upon;
and, falling those, the free seat! All you will have to do, my
Lord, will be to get your Clergy to put a little more go and spice
into their excellent sermons."
The good Ecclesiastic smiled pleasantly. He had received reports
from his energetio lieutenants of a hopeful character, and he "was
sanguine. The honest sons of toil under their charge had for some
time been having the doors of Museums and Picture Galleries merrily
slammed in their faces; and though, on their one day of reoreation,
they had perversely declined as yet to rush at leaps and bounds into
the back places of a suburban chapel of ease, still things looked
bright.
The Philanthropist oontinued, "Leave them nothing but their
grim, dirty, and wretched homes," he said, "and then, out of sheer
despair and ill-temper they surely must come! And they ought to
make a large, if irritable, harvest."
At this moment the speakers were joined by a Country Baronet,
drinking champagne from a soda-water glass.
FROM VOL. ILL

"Well, I think we've oarried this 'ere measure, anyways; and
I hear it's a working right down 'andsomely. Only yesterday a
real live West End Nob got three months for being found drinking a
bottle of Solum by himself in a railway carriage." There was a
roar of satisfaction from the earnest multitude. The speaker saw
his advantage, and continued:—" And what's our duty I should
like to ask yer, but to look after the morals of the Nob? For can
the Nob take care of hisself? Look at 'im in all these past years
asroin' from bad to wuss in them there Clubs of his, till the honest
Workin' Man felt that as the 'elplesB Nob could do nothink for hisself,
he must bestir hisself and do somethink for 'im 1 And what 'as the
Workin' Man done for 'im? I say it with pride—the Workin' Man
has rescued 'im. Caucus legislation has come to his aid, and he 'as
fought valiantly for that there Nob, and conquered,—though I say it."
The speaker paused a moment to take breath. Another deafening
oat-call told of the deep-rooted enthusiasm that held his audience.
A cool refreshing draught of gin from a pewter tankard on the com-
mittee-table seemed to give him new energy. And he proceeded—
"And what haven't we done for the Nob?" he asked, rising to
a high pitch of eloquence, as he warmed with his subject. "Haven't
we shut his Club for him every blessed night at halt-past nine?"
"We 'ave! Hooray, Mr. Sykks! Go it, William!" and other
responsive cries of fervid Parliamentary support echoed again a
again through the densely-packed building.
"Haven't we," the speaker went on, "made it criminal for him to
lay down more than half-a-dozen of anythink in his house at a time;
shut up his Club for 'im on Saturdays at three right up to ten on
Monday mornings ; took away his Sunday bit of Park, and got a new
Bill that's to put a settler on his gormandising hisself to death at
publio dinners through a ' Seoond Reading'? In a word, ain't w
lookin' after his morals like a father?"
The thunder of a thousand throats would have answered this noble
interrogatory, but at that moment the gas was suddenly turned out,
and, amidst a free fight and some thoughtful, but vigorous, head-
breaking, the great philanthropic meeting was hastily adjourned.
• •*•••
The Sunday afternoon so profitably spent.was over at length, and as
the shades of evening drew slowly in, the solitary Policeman in Pall
Mall found a pinohed and hungry figure crouched at the top of the
kitchen-steps of the Reform Club.
"Try in' to get in that way?" he said. "You onght to be
ashamed of yourself: and you an M.P. But you '11 just come along
with me."
The offioer seized the trembling creature by the collar as he spoke.
It only looked up at him beseechingly. "Don't be hard on me, good
Mr. Policeman! it whined sadly, "I'm doing no harm. I've only
been made very unhappy by Aot of Parliament!"
But in another minute officer and culprit were marching Bilently

A HANDBOOK OF KNOWLEDGE.
No. X.—The Hairdresser (cowtiwottd prom p. 227).
Will y ou describe some of the tortures and indignities experienced?
A. First there is the Ordeal of the Shroud.
Q. What is that?
A. A huge swathing of white linen or cotton print. It is "whipped"
around you with a twirl which fills your eyes and nose with irritating snippets
of hair. It is vigorously "tucked in," at the back of your neck inside your
shirt-collar. It oompresses your throat till your faoe reddens and your nose
itohes. You oannot rub it with your hands, because they are confined. If you
fumblingly attempt to chafe it throngh the shroud, you get more bits of hair
into your mouth and nostrils. You sneeze violently, your helplessness is
manifest, your degradation oomplete. You gaze at your reflection in the
mirror in front of you. A shining sheepish face, hair spiked ludicrously on
end like a burlesque scalp-lock, a head helplessly punched and turned, and
kneaded hither and thither, as though it were potter's day, or an "universal
joint," now cranked to the right, now crooked to the left, now with chin hoisted
in the air, now with nose buried in your shirt-front! You avert your glance;
you feel that resolution, and judgment, and self-respect are yours no more
for ever.
Q. Is not the worst now over P
A. By no means. Having reduced you to the weakness of self-contempt,
the Hairdresser seizes his desired opportunity.
Q. To do what P A. To patter and tout.
1 %^^%S!Em**T. unintelligently. obtrusively about the
topics of the time and the state of the weather. Patter has two chief forms .-
1. Emphatio assertion of the obvious.
2. Vague questioning concerning the trivial.
For example, your tormentor, stooping with an oily smirk, will whisper,
odorously. into 'your ear-which he looks, as reflected in the glass as^though
he were about to bite-confident assertions that It is a >ot mornin Sir that the
days are a-gettin' hoot nicely, that there » lots o' people about to-day ain t
there!- that we shall be 'avin' some fallin' weather before we've done >
winter now, and that we thall 'ave Crismns (he always
calls it Crismus) upon us before we kuow where we
har. Or he will ask von—as though you were a Meteoro-
logical Office, or a Political Oracle—wot sort of a day
you think we shall 'ave to-morrer; are we going to get a
bit o' summer this year? Wot you think of these'ere
Salvation Army chaps. Whether they 're a-goin' to
"ketch" that there "No. 1" after all, and wot's to
be Mr. Gladstimg's next little game. The helpless
auditor of this sort of thing is either reduced to abject
imbecility, or roused to boiling wrath. Happy is he upon
whom it only produces the former effect.
Q. What next? A. Patter is only preliminary to puff;
talking leads up—through personal rudeness—to touting,
Q. Explain this.
A. The Hairdresser pointedly calls your attention to
your personal defects or disfigurements, with a view to
puff and push off upon you the high-priced mucks and
messes which he proudly refers to as " hour Speeshallitys,
8ir!" Patter is exasperating, but Touting is little short
of criminal. It begins in rudeness to end—if you permit
it—in extortion.
Q. Is it not permissible for a Hairdresser, like any
other person, to push the sale of his wares in a respeotful
and legitimate way?
A. Certainly. But the Hairdresser pushes them in a
fashion that is not respectful and is not legitimate.
Q. Howistbat?
A. In the first place, from your helpless position as
subjeot of his oraft, he has you at an unfair advantage.
You cannot get away from his oily fingers, his greasy
whispers, his fatuous cackle, his personal critioisms. his
unblushing puffs. If he tells you in a tone of confident
candour, that your hair is "offly dry," "going off
oolour," or "gettin' terrible thin a-top," the imperti-
nence which in another oase would urn kicks from your
boots is regarded in his as a natural means of extorting
halfpence from your pockets. If he assures you that his
wretched unguents and stimulants and dyes will repair
the ravages of time, the brazen and dishonest falsehood
with whioh he insults your intelligence and assaults
your purse is not recognised or resented as a fraudulent
attempt at "obtaining money under false pretences,'
but as being " all in the way of-business."
. Q. Is the Hairdresser's system more unfair and offen-
sive than that of many other trades?
A. It is; for several reasons:—
1. His facilities for impertinence and importunity
are, from the necessity of the case, exceptional.
2. His mode of puffing his nasty nostrums is par
ticularly unpleasant and unscrupulous.
3. The nasty nostrums themselves are peculiarly
worthless and deleterious.
Can you suggest any amelioration of the unple
Q.
sant state of things which you describe P
A. Art may perhaps, someday, devise something which
will make us independent of the manual manipulations
of the degenerate modern Figaro. Pending that most
desirable consummation, the annoyances actually attend-
ing the necessarily unpleasant operation of shearing and
shaving might be indefinitely diminished. The Hair-
dresser should be strictly, if netd be legally, limited to
the deft exercise of his legitimate functions. You wish
him to out your hair or shave ynur beard. You do not
wish him to discuss politios with you. More emphati-
cally still, you do not wish him to puff and push his
particular wares.* Were patter rigorously limited, and
touting inexorably prohibited, hair-cutting need not be,
what at present it is, the most agonising and exacer-
bating of social ordeals.

poverty-Btrioken spot has written an introduction, which is nothing
more nor less than an urgent appeal to the charitable. In 1878 the
fleet of one hundred flat-bottomed sloops were reduced to twenty-
seven. A Benefit Sooiety has been organised, which at present has
only £8 in hand. The 307 fishermen, and their families, on the
island scarcely ever taste meat, and chiefly feed upon haddock.
There are only five exhibits in this department. The first is "a
fishing-line in tray complete," the second " a lobster-pot." the third
"a model," and the fourth " a buoy invented by the Exhibitor."
In the summer months fishing is almost entirely abandoned, as the
hardy boatmen employ their time in connection with the bathing-
machine interest, which flourishes at this season of the year. In
conclusion, the Governor pathetically explains that, although
"yielding to none as fishermen," they are preoluded from going far
to sea to earn their daily bread, "because they have no harbour."
Perhaps this little display from Heligoland is the most painful
feature in the Exhibition—even more heart-rending than the Bogus-
Economical Fish-Market, which was to reduce the price of "the
harvest of the sea," but hasn't!
Bahama*. — Again disappointing. The "Central Committee,
Nassau," seem to have done their best to make the Show attractive
by exhibiting, amongst a few other articles, "a pair of Palmetto
shoes " and two kegs of pickled goggle-eyes," But as pearls are
found in the fisheries of this country, the opportunity is seized by a
West-End tradesman to have a branch establishment for the dis-
play of his jewellery—in which, of course, pearls are introduced.
British Columbia. — Chiefly remarkable for a jovial exhibit, which
would have brought tears to the eves of Sir Wilfrid Lawuon—" A
number of fishes in alcohol." It is only just, however, to say that,
in spite of this piscatorial display of intemperance, the deport-
ment of the tipsy denizens of the boundless ocean is inoffensive—
nay, even dignified.
Ceyhn.—This interesting land is represented by a few nets and
some models. One of the latter—No. 4—is indeed remarkable. We
are told by the Catalogue that as prawns are used as bait from this
boat, it is oalled "the prawn boat.' It is difficult to oonoeive how
they oome to think of such olever things in Ceylon.
Newfoundland.—Ignored in our edition of their Official Guide.
However, it is worth seeing if only for some specimens of "strong
oopper-ore"—an odd fish. Remaining exhibits chiefly ood-fish.
Model of a seal-hunt, also interesting. Seals said to be very fieroe
creatures, and capturing them a hazardous employment. In fact, if
you want to get a seal, you must keep on the watch.

PITY A POOR OFF'UN I"
The Rosebery Jockey "chucked" bt Scotch Bcsinesi.
Canada.—Also contemptuously omitted in the Catalogue. The
most striking objeot in this Court is a magnificent "trophy," hap-
pily recalling the glories of the Exhibition of 1862, which, it will be
remembered, culminated in a gorgeous case of pickles. Nothing
finer than this "trophy" ean be seen out of the Civil Service Stores.
However, there is a slight omission—the prices of the various potted
fishes, &o., should have been given. The Dominion is further repre-
sented .by an ice-house made of layers of "Willesden paper "—a
material which, as everybody knows, is found in huge quantities in
the primaeval forests of the Canadian backwoods! Besides'the above,
there are some models of fish-breeding establishments and a few tins
of "preserved salmon." Large map of the country cumbers one of
the walls; the space should have been appropriately spared for
advertisements. From this it must not be supposed that everything
is sacrificed to " commercial purposes." On the oontrary, the col-
lection also contains a very well prepared skeleton of a cod's head!
Australia— Also ignored by ** the other Guide." The principal
exhibit is a large coat-of-arms of the Colony, whioh, perhaps, may
be accepted as a specimen of fishy heraldry.
Having run through " The Dependencies of the British Throne," it
will be as well to turn our attention next to the Foreign Courts, of
whioh that claimed by the United States seems to be the chief. By
the way, there is a so-called " American Bar," whioh, apparently,
has as little to do with our transatlantic cousins as with the bar of
the ocean. And the sustenance obtained at this bar is not to be
compared with the nourishment obtained by the harvest of the sea,
upon whioh. it is to be hoped, Sir Henet Thompson, the eminent
surgeon, will shortly be induced to deliver a leoture. For, after all,
the end of the Exhibition should be an increased activity in dealing
with " the denizens of the mighty deep." It must be remembered
that fish is not only excellent as food for the body, but is also a
capital medicine (containing as it does phosphorus) for what the late
Dr. Fokbks Wrastow used appropriately to call "the obsoure
diseases of the brain."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LA! QIOCONDA!
OR, FONCHIELLI AND TOBIA'8 OPERA.
Wl have heard La Gioconda twine, and like it. There are in it
elements of popularity,—in f aet, the elements are so familiar that its
popularity is a foregone oonolusion. It belongs to the Yerdi school,
and is just the sort of thing that a
olever musical imitator with a certain
humorous talent for composition, might
produce, if left alone with a grand piano,
a big drum, and a pair of cymbals.
At Covent Garden, the Opera is
capitally put on the Stage, and the
success of Madame Durand as J.a
Gioconda, of Mile. Tbemelli as La
Circa, of Madame Stahl as Laura,
and of Signor Cotogm as Barnaba is
indisputable. The Artistes above-
named can act as well as sing. The
Chorus is admirable; and the pitched—
the high-pitched battle they have with
the orohestra, which vainly endeavours
by the aid of brass, drum, and cymbals,
and, we fancy, an unfairly brought in
Song, to drown their voices, is won by
le Chorus in the most gallant style.
The Opera, as far as the acting goes,
is remarkable for the reckless disregard
of the stage-directions contained in the
published book. In the First Soene—
"the Qrand Courtyard of the Ducal
Palace "—where all the oelebrated sights of Venice are so oleverly
brought together, that a Cook's Tourist with a Murray's Handbook
would see the whole place in half-an-hour, and be off by the next
train some where else —" The Stage," says the stage-direotion, "it
fitted with holiday folks"— Cook's
Tourists of the period—"Monks, Sailnrs,
Shipwrights, Masquers, fyc, and amidst
the busy crowd are seen some Dalmatians
and Moors." Now, we won't swear to
knowing "some Dalmatians" when we
see them,—except Dalmatian Dogs which
run behind carriages,—but we will take
oath to a Moor anywhere,—from

Boat-race.

Scotland to Venice,—and we deliberately
assert that we couldn't see a Moor on
that Stage. There wasn't a Moor there;
no Moor there was. Was Othello a Moor
or notP Yes. "Was he black? Yes.
Very well, then—if there was a black
man in that crowd, we tell "a white one,"
that's all.
We looked for the "Monks," but they
were conspicuous by their absence. Mind,
we praise the Stage-Manager for this, as
he evidently rightly eaid, What should
Monks be doing here when they ought
to be in Church, where we shall want them presently to sing a
hymn."—Right: bnt why leave them in the printed stage-directions,
and so waste the precious time of the audience, and distract our
attention from the music P We
are not sure whether the
audience couldn't insist legally
on having their money re-
turned: as, if someone who
likes to see Monks and Moors
3n the Stage, purchases a
guinea ticket because he has
read in the officially guaranteed
Opera book that Monks and
Moors are to be seen on that
Stage in the First Aot, and,
when he goes, there are none,
hasn't he his legal remedy
against Mr. Gye and his co-
Directors for breach of con-
tract, or for obtaining money
under false pretences P
We concede the " some Dal-
matians"—they might have
been there; but Monks and
Moors we conscientiously affirm
were not on that scene as they undoubtedly ought to have been. A fez
or a turbsn doesn't make a Moor; and we want a Moor proprt—i.e., a
proper Moor, or even a property Moor. Passons! Barnaba, the

bad man of the piece, ought, on the entrance of La Gioconda and
her Blind Mother, to " hide behind a column." He doesn't do any-
thing of the sort: first, became there is no column handy for the
purpose; and, secondly, because he has to join in a trio, for which, if
he is to be heard at all, he must come down to the footlights and
ktand in a line, tn Evidence, with La Gioconda, whom Barnaba calls
the "Moth"—(but he is
always alluding to people
as "Gadflies" and
"Moths " and "Lions"
—funny bad man, Bar-
naba) — and La Cieca.
This position of his is
all right for Cieca, who
is blind as a bat (why
didn't Barnaba allude
to her as "the bat" P—
oversight of Librettist),
but not for La Gioconda,
who has to make believe
very much that she
doesn't see him when he
is within a few feet of
her in the open court-
yard, shouting his asides
to the effect that at the
sight of Gioconda, "the
wildest ecstasies within
me waken! Beware, thee, Moth, if in my net thou 'rt taken I"
Thev all use "thee" and "thou" in the translation, as if they
were Venetian Quakers. For this reason, it might be styled a
Bright Opera. Then Barnaba tries to stop Gioconda, who, being
only an ill-educated street-singer, comes out pretty strongly with
"Go thou to the devil, thou and thy guitar, too!"
And after this display of temper, which has still something of the
Quaker in it, Barnaba exclaims, "Ah, no; thou shalt not fly me"
—whereupon she immediately does fly him, and makes a precipitate
exit. "So!" says Barnaba, "the Moth has escaped me." Only
because the idiot didn't run after her. The Moth, who must walk
quite fourteen stone, couldn't have got far in two minutes; though,
having a fine and. powerful arm. she might have given him a nasty
one on his ear, had he attempted to come up with her.
Then everybody returns, singing brightly and gaily one of the best
numbers in the Opera. Here the Librettist becomes tired of details,
and simply writes, "Entet—Chorus People, Sfc, bringing in triumph
the Victor in the Regatta." This summary of " Chorus People, #c.,"
looks like the result of a row with the Stage-Manager, resulting in a
compromise. No Moors, no "some Dalmatians," no Shipwrights,
simply any of them brought in, en bloc, as " Chorus People, &o.
The boat-race has, apparently, been between a very fat man and a
very slight one, with the inevitable result. Zuane, the fat man, who
required at least another twelve months' training, is very angry,
objeots to Bad Barnaba's chaff, but honestly admits " My boat was
sadly over-weighted." Barnaba incites Zuane and the "Chorus
People, &c." to murder La Cieca as a Witch (it is a stupid story), and
they are just going to haul her off when La Gioconda rushes in;
then Gioconda's lover, Enzo, comeB to
the rescue, and addresses the "Chorus
People, 4c," thus: "These locks, grey
and scattered, Harm no longer 1 My
sword shall protect them!" from
which sentiment the inference would
naturally be, that Enzo was a Venetian
Hairdresser, whose trade was liable to
suffer from the "Chorus People,
&o.'s," violence towards the old Lady
with the very apparent gauze over
her eyes, meant to indicate blindness,
—which it doesn't a bit, and
only
looks exactly like what it is, i.e.,
gauze, which is most useful when
going by road to the Derby, but point-
less and unsightly for La Cieca.
Then enter, down the staircase,
Alvise and Laura his wife, followed
by a couple of pages, carrying two
sofa - cushions, and keeping near
Alvise and Laura, as if they had
contracted a habit of sitting down
suddenly anywhere, or of going to sleep in the middle of the
road, and so requiring a cushion for comfort at any minute,
without the slightest warning. Laura wears a half-mask, for no
reason, except for the sake of the plot, so that she may not be I
recognised by La Gioconda, in the Second Act. "Why art thou I

kneeling to yonder people," asks Alviie, according to the book. To
whioh La Cieca might reply, "I wasn't kneeling," which would be
true. La Gioconda, subsequently kneeling to Atvise (she does this),
says, "Mercy! Ah, hear me one moment! I break The ice that in
fetters my soul was keeping." Isn't this poetic 1 She "breaks the
ice" by entering into conversation with the Chief Magistrate Alviie,
without any previous introduction. Laura protects La Cieca, and
in one of the most effective passages of the Opera—(the restoration
of " .Fops' Alley" is one of the most " effective passages" at Covent
Garden)—admirably given by Madame Tkemelli, La Cieca thanks
Laura, and gives her "all she has no more, tho' poor the offering
be,"—nota "heart and lute" butarosary,—whereupon the " Chorus
People, &c," who had been so eager to cut her grey and scattered
locks, now express their decided opinion that " 'Tis evident unto her
celestial aid is given." Then all yielding to a sudden Happy
Thought,—such as was perpetually occurring to that character in
one of Dickens's novels, who says. Hallo! here's a Church! Let's
go in and get married,"—hurry off to Church, except Bad Barnaba
and Enzo, the Undecided Lover, who is now devoted to Laura.
(It it a stupid story! and such an ill-oonstruoted plot!)
Barnaba promises Enzo that Laura, Enzo't wife, shall elope with
him that night, and, as a proot of his sineerity, Barnaba opens his
waistcoat, and shows " C X." worked on his flannel waistcoat, which
may be either tor the instruction of the washerwoman, or to denote
that he belongs to CX division of Venetian Deteotive Police. Enzo
is so pleased at this, that he curses him freely, and goes off. Then
Barnaba summons a Scribe, a sort of "Jim the Penman," and
in the middle of the large courtyard dictates a letter which is
overheard by La Gioconda. Dismissing Jim the Penman without any
payment for his trouble, Bad Barnaba slips the letter into the Lion's
mouth, and hurries away. The letter is to inform Alviie of his
wife's intended elopement.
Then enter Masquers and Populace. They sing and dance an Irish
jig, whioh, of course, is suddenly interrupted by the Monks (here
they are at last—heard, but not seen) in Church singing a " vesper
prayer,"—whatever that may be,—whereupon all the Masquers, men
on one side, and women on the other, kneel down piously, with the
exception of the Harlequins and Harlequinas, who as their tights would
hardly stand the strain of a prayerful attitude, dance gaily off; and
with this exit, and La Cieca blessing La Gioconda for no particular
reason, but just to "form a picture," the First Aot comes to
an end.
The Second Aot commences with a scene and chorus recalling a
similar situation in the Flying Dutchman, and then the people
execute a mal-de-mer movement, whioh makes everyone, not a periect
sailor, feel very uncomfortable. Then Laura is brought in a boat
by Bad Barnaba to elope with Enzo, and, while the latter has gone to
make some preparation aboard the oraft, Gioconda comes on the
scene, has a tremendous row with Laura (her rival in Enzo't
affections), declares that " Fury superhuman of my wrath invades
my pulses!" (isn't this thrilling!), and then, when Laura, who is a
married woman who has come here on purpose to elope, declares " I
love him with purer love than thine," Gioconda can stand it no
longer, but addresses her'as "Blasphemer 1" to which Laura
quickly retorts, "Liar!" and so these two perfect Ladies go on
through a whole scene, until Gioconda [the is masked this time—
what a stupid story 1) recognises the rosary, which the pious Laura
is going to take with her on her elopement tour, and relents.
Barnaba is foiled; Alviie doesn't find his wife out, because she
has returned home in a boat; and Enzo, unable to elope with Alvite't
wife, sets fire to his ship, tries to born everybody, but makes it all
right for himself by jumping into the sea, where he may be supposed
to dive successfully, as ne turns up in the next Aot alive and well
in a new suit of clothes, at Alvite't evening party, in time to see the
Ballet of the Hours, whioh is a great success.
After this, poison, dagger, sleeping draught, Romeo-and-Juliet-
Le-Roi-s'Amuse-Lucrezia-Borgia scene between Alvite and Laura,
&c, &c, &c, everything iu its proper place, very cheerful, of
course, and Madame Durand playing dramatically, and singing
admirably. The end of this Opera we gave last week. Bad Barnaba
declares that he has strangled La Cieca because she annoyed him,
and then he rushes down the street. The Opera is successful, though
not to be mentioned in the same breath with Bizet's brilliant
Carmen, and as Mr. Waoqstaff says, "fortunately for us, Carmen
arrived when we had had too much of the Wag ner."
Lucca, as the heroine, is better than ever.

JUSTICE TO THE DOCTORS.
"Our only General" has not done justice
to the Dootors, that is to say, if we are to
believe his latest utterances, for his opinions
on the Medical Department in the late
campaign in Eeypt are strangely contradic-
tory of each other. We all know that before
Lord Moblet's Committee Lord Wolselet
gave evidence in no measured language,
saying that he found great fault with the
hospitals at Ismailia and Cairo, and, among
other things, censuring the medioal officers
for not going out themselves and buying
bread and bedsteads, though he does not
say where the money was to oome from,
and while he must have known that it was
the duty of the Ordnance Department to
supply them. The faot is. that if matters
were _ in the oondition Lord Wolselet
describes, he was himself more to blame
than anyone else, for he ought to have seen
that the Commissary-General of Ordnance
did his duty, and there can be no doubt
but that the head of the Medioal Depart-
ment should have been informed of the
ohange of base from Alexandria to Ismailia.
Bnt what is still more strange. Lord
Wolselet has only Just discovered all these
things. He said, at Ismailia, he was "highly
satisfied with everything in the hospital,"
he complimented various medioal men, and
he telegraphed home that the Medical De-
partment was working to his entire satis-
faction; again repeating, after Tel-el-
Kebir, that everything was done that
possibly could be done for the care of the
sick and wounded. The same evidence, it
may be noted incidentally, was given by
Sir John Adti; and it is abundantly
evident that while no one, least of all the
medioal officers, ever contended that the
arrangements were perfect, everything
seems to have been done that was possible
with the means at their command.
Now, the plain faot of the matter is, that
there must be a mistake in one or other of
Lord Wolsbxet'b statements. If things
were as bad as he now makes them out to
be, why didn't he say so at the time t and
why did he telegraph home that he was
satisfied with the Medioal Department?
Which account is the correct one? Upon
the horns of that lively dilemma Lord
Wolselet sits impaled; and Surgeon-
General Punch demands justice for his
friends the Dootors.
The School Board summoned a mother
for not sending her son, aged thirteen, to
school. The boy was earning his own liveli-
hood and helping his mother, and, said Mr.
Paget, "I think it was an indiscreet act on
the part of the School Board to interfere
with the boy." He fined the Defendant six-
pence, whioh was immediately paid by a
sympathetic stranger. The School Board
is getting itself disliked. Does the rising
generation seem to be so very much better
for this compulsory education? To learn to
read and write is well enough, but what do
they read P and do they right r We should
like to hear the evidence of the Magistrates
fenerally. In the meantime, thanks to Mr.

Of music, and, as then you

You reoognise the sweet

No wonder that such power it
should reveal,
It eats the largest snail up at
a meal.
If Man ate like a thrush, it's

And surely such a naturalist

He'd eat at one meal a whole

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Common*, Monday, June 4.—Left House at eight o'olock
with prospeot of Corrupt Practices Bill most satisfactory. Nearly
everyone supported Second Reading. Fortune of Bill completed by
opposition of Warton and Charles Lewis. Thought of saying a few
words for it myself, but in circumstances unnecessary. So went off
to dinner.
Coming back at eleven found Attorney-General apparently
delivering funeral oration, or addressing a Common Jury in a murder
ease. _ Solemnity appalling. Cadence of voice a little monotonous,
but still capable of moving Jury to tears.
"What's happened P" I asked Habcoubt, who was strolling out,
gently stroking his chin, and softly smiling to himself. "Going to
withdraw the Bill or be beaten on a Division P"
"Neither, my dear Tobt," said Grandiose Old Man. "It's only
James's Ox ford-Circuit way. Thinks he's defending a man for
sheep-stealing: that funereal manner, and that voice with a tear in
it are preparatory to calling witnesses to show that the prisoner
either Had a dying mother at the time of the act oharged, or that
owing to a long series of undeserved misfortunes, his mind had
become affected, and that when he took the sheep he thought it
was a favourite poodle he had lost in infancy. Fact is, it's most
difficult for lawyers to forget that House iei not a Jury, and that
Speaker and Clerks at Table are not Judges idtting in banco. Have
discretion and valour.
The Duke of Cambridge, in
the House of Lords, "expressed
the opinion that the raising
the standard of age to nine-
teen would decrease the num-
ber of enlistments." Do youth
generally begin to get indis-
posed to become food for
powder at that approach to
years of discretion r
heard it said that I'm the only great lawyer who is also effective
House of Commons speaker. A little kindly exaggerated, but
perhaps something in it."
Bill all right, after all. Second Reading agreed to without
Division.
Tuesday.—House of Lords to-night scene of tremendous dissension
on Bishops' Bench. Bishop of Carlisle moved Second Reading
of Cathedral Statutes Bill. Joseph Glujs in Gallery scented the
row from afar. Came to see how Bishops quarrelled. From very
first his keen intelligence went with Opposition.
"What do they want with more statutes in Cathedrals P " says he.
"Thought you English would have had enough of statutes. Just
after moving the Duke of Wellington, and don't know what to do
with him. Better leave statutes alone, and go on grinding the poor
Irish."
Bishop of Peterborough opposed Bill on quite other grounds.
Managed with great dexterity, in discussing it, to give Govern-
ment several digs in the ribs. Lord Salisbury hugely delighted.
"Pity Peterbobouoh took Orders," says he. "His lawn sleeves
tie his hands. If he'd been a layman, and got in for some borough,
he would have ohanged affairs in House of Commons. He would
have joined the Fourth Party, or perhaps created it, and made
things hot for everybody all round, especially the Government."
"Yes," Lord Granville sweetly lisped. "Peterborough's a
little lost here; we can't do with a Randolph, more especially in
lawn."
Peterborough stood alone, with baok to the wall, having dropped
tin bonnet-box of dynamite on Bishops' Bench. Pretty to see other

Bishops smiling upon him with brotherly love, though in aot rather
plainly showing their teeth.
"Clever, amusing, bat too ingenious," said the Primate,
smilingly nodding bis head towards his Right Reverend brother, who
didn't seem to know that anybody was twittering.
"If y Right Reverend brother asks me to withdraw the Bill," said
the Bishop of Carlisle, holding both hands out as if about to pro-
nounce the benediction. "I wish my Right Reverend brother could
withdraw his speech."
Right Reverend brother no suoh intention. Had had his fling,
had fluttered the House, was conscious of great yearning of heart
towards him by Lord Salisbury, and didn't seem to care so muoh
for opinion of ArchbUhop, as was expected from one who had just
been extolling institutions and discipline of the Church.
"Not so sure as Granville is about impossibility of Fourth Party
in Lords," said Randolph. "Must have some talk with Peter-
borough, and see if he '11 take it up. Perhaps oouldn't be expected
to find in Lords equal of Gorst for profound legal knowledge
touched with subtle humour, of Wolff for intimate acquaintance
with Foreign Affairs, or for Balfour for ways that are childlike and
bland. But something might be done. Would be an immense lift
for us to have a Bishop playing our game in the Lords."
In Commons spent cheerful Morning Sitting discussing Scotch
Agricultural Holdings Bill. In the evening Sunday Closing people
desperately tried to make a House. But no use. Members who had sat
through Scotch debate all in bed, with wet cloths round their heads.
"Sunday Closing all very well," says Mr. Cotes, "but I'm not
sure that Tuesday Closing isn't better."
Tuesday Closing Bill accordingly brought in by Mr. Wabton,
Standing Orders suspended, passed through all its stages, and at ten
minutes past nine all lights out. Business done.— Scotch Agricul-
tural Holdings Bill read a Second Time.
Wednesday.—Another case of gross injustice to Ireland. By
judicious balloting, day had been seoured for Second Reading of
Irish Municipal Elections Bill. Then comes Chairman of Commit-
tees with some in considerable proposal about British Railways, and
appropriates Sitting. Irish Members aghast with indignation at
this obstruction. Captain Molloy-Ahot hit upon happy thought.
Move the Adjournment at half-past five. Then be too late to take
division on Otway's proposals.
"If they won't let us get on," said the gallant Captain, "they
shall do nothing."
Pointed out to him that this excellent plan had disadvantages. If
House didn't divide now, question oome on again on another Wed-
nesday, and Iruh Members finally bowled out. So Mollot-Ahoy
did not press Motion, and Otway carried his Resolution.
Further grievance behind this. Cainf had second place for
Biggar Relief Bill, which newspapers stiffly call Bill to Repeal
Breach of Promise of Marriage Aot. It was too late to be useful to
Joseph Gillis. But J. G. has a heart that feels for others, and had
determined to second the Motion for Second Reading. Bill not
reached. Caink and Dick Power going about Lobby gloomily,
charged with jokes intended to make on moving and opposing Bill.
"I '11 work mine off on the Criminal Code Procedure Bill when it
oomes down," says Caink.
"I '11 work mine off on Army Estimates," says Dick Power.
"Question of breechloaders, you know, and work it round to Breach
of Promise. A little difficult, but if Chairman objects, can argue
the matter. That will vet in a bit more of the speech, and can finish
it on Motion to Report Progress."
Business done.—Repealed prohibition against paying interest on
Railway Lines in course of construction.
Thursday.—Tim Hbalt baok with us again after fresh experiences
of prison life. Hair more than ever like severely twisted mop.
Do they—er—crop your hair, doncha?" murmured Mr. Chris-
topher Sykeh, regarding TtM with air of profound, yet nervous
curiosity, as if he were animal newly imported for the Aquarium,
with no guarantee that he wouldn't bite.
"No,,r says Tim. "Fact is always keep it like that ready for
emergencies. Never know when you 're going in, and hardly ever
when you 're coming out. If I let my hair grow in ordinary way.

Lord Rosebery retired from Home Office because be couldn't get on
with Grandiose Old Man. Habcourt almost affected to tears.
"Not only were we on terms of (political friendship," says he, "but
we loved eaoh other as brothers." By mighty effort controlled him-
self; but there were sobs in various parts of the House. Joseph

Argument.—Vrbnon-Arcotjrt, an amiable political philanthropist, having in an
unguarded moment been induced by the Puritani, a dyspeptic but powerful band of social
conspirators, to make Sunday as uncomfortable as possible, has suddenly, by a subtle and
arbitrary Act, deprived the populace for twenty-four hours of its beer. Growing thirsty
aa the summer advances, and maddened by this and other pieces of grandmotherly legisla-
tion, it at length rises in rebellion against the restrictions with which its tastes and
appetites have been hampered, and seeking aid of the Caucus, by a terrible retaliation
obliges Vernon-Arcourt and his order quite unexpectedly to restore to it many of its
cherished enjoyments, and among othent, amidst indescribable enthusiasm, it* ancient
and valued privilege of occasionally getting drunk on some one else's premises.

The Scene represents a Secret Official Chamber in the recesses of the Palace of
the Home Office. As the Curtain rises, Vernon-Arcourt, surrounded by
Wilfrido and the Chiefs of the Puritani, and standing up to his knees in
Petitions from Sunday School Children with which they have presented
him, is discovered listening attentively to the following subterranean chorus.

To face an unpopular charge.
Yet my friends, who entangle me here,
Should, I feel, by concession be bought:
They would mulct the poor man of his beer;
Well—I'm still doubting whether they ought.
For I cannot quite see why a measure so strong
Should in one ease be right, in another be wrong I

The great Vernon-Arcourt is getting along!
He's now muddled up 'twixt what 'a right and what's

Vernon-Arcourt. I'm compelled to look out how I tread,

As this Bill has been flung at my head,

That they 're saved from a beer-drinking shoal.

A short time since quite a passage of arms took place in the
House of Commons became the Commanding Officer of a Militia
Regiment had sanctioned the drawing of some money in payment for
the phantom forage of an imaginary charger. It was advanced that,
although this particular or rather not very particular Adjutant did
not usually possess a horse, he produced one onoe, on a special occa-
sion, for his Colonel's inspection. It may be said generally that
the typical Adjutant's horse has puzzled thousands. So, as par-
ticulars about this mysterious beast have been for many years more
than vague, it would be as well in future that some form containing
questions requiring answers should be rilled up by the parties
interested, before dealings with public money received Government
sanction. The following will serve as a guide to the mode of
furnishing the required document:—

Question. Do you hire your horse for the training? If so, state
what are his occupations during the non-training period.
Answer. I do hire my horse for the training. I believe his occu-
ations during the non-training period are drawing a night cab,
elping in fourth-class funerals, and making himself generally
useful at a bathing establishment on the Margate sands.
Q. Is your horse perfeotly sound P Do you known of any ailment
from which he suffers, or has suffered?

wind, is stone-blind, and quite deaf. I believe that the knees of all

And play with rod and line.

And let my faoe get brown;
And dream away the sunny days

A. Yes, at Astley's five-and-twenty years ago, when he was
employed as " an extra "—his duty was to pretend to be dead in a
corner—in the Spectacular Drama of The Battle of the Alma.
Q. Do you propose retaining your horse for the next training?
A. No; as I understand that he has been purchased by a purveyor
of cats'-mcat (the sale to take effect the day after the regimental
training, by agreement with the representatives of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), I shall have to discover his

'Tis not of his strength declining,

No spell these squabbles will stay.
And the Old Man's eyes grow dim.
For he thinks of his Bill-blocked way,
And the hours that are lost to him.

Of the Session's waste he is thinking,

than in the building, in the shape of an aged Chinaman in huge
spectacles. This remarkable personage generally walks about fol-
lowed by a large and critical throng who examine carefully his
every gesture. On Wednesday last (a half -crown day) a numerous
orowd assembled near the Chinese pagoda, and it was at first supposed
that the spot had been the scene of some dreadful accident. When it
transpired that the gathering were collected together to watch the old
Chinaman while he smoked a pipe, the crowd grew infinitely larger.
Germany and Greece.—These two nations may be taken together,
as, combined, their list of exhibits is a very poor one. The principal
object of interest contributed by Germany is a bundle of whalebone,
while the kingdom of the Hellenes is ohiefly represented by some
"lobster-tails from the Island of Soopelos."
Japan.—Extremely interesting, and the Court nearly as well ar-
ranged as that of the Chinese Department. On examining the Official
Catalogue, however, it will be found that in spite of the brave array,
the " leading articles " of the collection are a tinned oyster, a stuffed
crab, and some cod-liver oil. The Japanese salesman in attendance,
who is intensely European and busmesslike, merits—but does not
obtain—as much observation as the Chinese smoker.
Netherlands.—More nets, and tinned fishes. The Dutch seem to have
devoted most of their time to curing herrings and catching salmon.
Norway and Sweden.—.Remarkable for several fine sardine trophies.
As these pyramids of saleable articles may look too tempting to a
casual visitor with a turn for petty larceny, the Authorities have
eecurtd their safety by covering them over with fishing-nets.
OUE OFFISHIAL GUIDE.
Past V.—Vbby much Abroad.
Having now exhausted England and the Colonies, we turn our
attention to foreign affairs. Many of our neighbours seem to have
had the greatest possible difficulty in getting anything of a piscatorial
character for exhibition. Under these cir-
cumstances, they have done their best, with
much bunting and gilding, to hide the
nakedness of the land, or rather the sea.
Following the plan we have hitherto pur-
sued, we run through the Courts, bestowing
a few notes upon each.
Austro-Hungary.—A magnificent dis-
play of heraldry and flags surrounding a
shelf, upon which are placed half-a-dozen
small bottles containing the sole Austro-
HuDgarian exhibits—some specimens of
the ocean parasite, or sea-flea f
France.—Most disappointing. A few
boxes of sardines and some old oyster-shells.
. „ , ,,, . For so large a country, a perfectly miser-
Eels oyer Ead. able digpiay. However, the oolleotion is
rendered interesting hyjtwo remarkable exhibits: the first, a " pro-
visional map of the world," subject, of course, to the Author's
subsequent alterations; and the last, "tiles furnished with oyster-
spat of different sizes, dead, but can be had alive if required."
Gressy is the name of the oyster revivifier. With so marvellous a
gift he ought to be promptly engaged for the "variety entertain-
ment" at the Royal Westminster Aquarium.
United States of America.—A verjr respectable display, in which,
however, the commercial element is in noways neglected. For
instance, Mr. Chables Alden, of Randolph, Massachusetts, sends an
"exhibit of goods prepared by the Alden evaporating process."
Again, Mr. Loss sends an " improved ice-crusher." Of course, no
Fishery Exhibition could have been complete without these articles.
The hall in which they are laid out is profusely decorated with the
Regimental Flags of the American Army, and here and there a

Spain.—A well-arranged Court. Seemingly, the National Naval
Museum has been dispatched bodily from the Peninsula to South
Kensington. The exhibits come exclusively from this collection,
which includes " six pieces of cork" and " two bolsters."
Rustics.—Ignored by the Offioial Guide, but, for all that, meri-
torious. The usual " pleasant little gathering" of nets, preserved-
fish tins, and implements of pisoatoriai torture.
The Foreign Fish-Market.—Quite as disappointing as the British
ditto. The "Market," which is held in a small room, contains a
few specimens of richly-scented dried fish and some sardine-oases.
Motto to be placed over the door: "A rose would swell as sweet—
and sweeter!"
So muoh for the Foreigners, who certainly cannot compare with
our British exhibitors. The Courts are rendered more attractive
than they would be au naturel by the introduction of a very choice
collection of church organs. It is not easy, however, to see what
these instruments have to do with Pisciculture, the more especially
as the talented individuals who at intervals perform upon them are
far too advanced to have anything to do with scales.
Having now visited the chief objects of interest in South Kensing-
ton, Home, Colonial, and Foreign, a rapid run through "the
Machinery in Motion," and a necessarily hurried visit to "the Six-
penny Fish Dinner," will bring our "Omshial Guide " to a meohani-
oal plus gastronomio termination.

Little All Bight 'un.
A "WARHAM CORNER" IN THE STRAND.
Silver Quilt, at the Strand, intended for a travesty of The Silver
King, at the Princess's, is first-rate fun at the commencement, but
it becomes rather wearisome when it
wanders into other melodramatic sub-
jects, such as Drink and the Lights of
London. Mr. Righton is more like Mr.
John Clayton than Mr. "Wilson Bar-
rett, but Mr. Bbough's imitation of
Mr. Qeobge Barrett is simply perfect.
It is for the most part very smartly
written, and, up to a certain point, Mr.
Wabham has done his work capitally.
The " business," as long as the original
play is being fairly burlesqued, is genu-
inely funny.
Miss Laura Linden gives a clever
caricature of Miss Eastlake's manner-
isms; but, occasionally, her tone far
more closely resembles Miss Ellen
Terry's than that of the person she
is burlesquing. The duet and dance
between Miss Linden and Mr. Righton
is very neatly exeouted, and obtains a
hearty encore. The songs and choruses,
having very little and occasionally nothing to do with the piece,
only delay the action, and mystify the audience.
Mr. Hawtbey's make-up for Old Father Christmas is also very
good, and the idea of the Detective, who says nothing, but only comes
on to look puzzled, to scratch
his head, and to change the
scene with a stroke of a har-
lequin's wand, it should have
been _ a prompter's whistle,
was immense at first, but it
palled on frequent repetition.
The fact is, if Silver Guilt
were cut down to forty-five
minutes, instead of playing
over an hour and a half, as it
now does, and if the action
and dialogue were strictly
confined to the travesty of The
Silver Xing, its success would
be as lasting as that of its
original. The mechanical
changes of scene are really
marvels of ingenuity, and the
music is so well selected that
it is a pity there are not better
voices to sing it, and better
danoera to dance to it,—the
duet, already mentioned, being
the one bright exception.
On the first night the Aotors
were called before the curtain,
as also was the Author, Mr.
Wakham, who must have been
delighted with—as he would probably term it—the very War ham
reception accorded to him.

Miss Laura Linden as Hiss Eastlake,—
a clerer Actress, but not a Jenny
Lind 'un.
Of Vice- Verid we have spoken some time ago. The Messrs.
Hawtrxy are excellent in it, and so is Miss Lauba Linden.
The other Burlesque, produoed on the same night at the Adelphi,
and, as part of the joke, called "a Drama," by Mr. Wilkxe Collins,
will probably have oome to an end ere this appears, so let us Bhed a
passing tear over the unfortunate Rank and Riches, which thoroughly
deserved all the pep-
pering it got from the
Crif
Jritics, and the jeers
with which the Publio
reoeived it on its first
representation. We
rather fancy that Mr.
Wilkie Collins—
first-rate, in his own
peculiar line, as a
Novelist, though
even there not up to
the Frenchman Gabo-
biau in plots,—ex-
cepting always The Woman in
White,—has never been successful
as a Dramatist, except when he has
had the assistance of some practical
Stage-Manager or Actor to suggest
what was required for stage-effect.
We may be wrong, but it seems to us
that, left to himself, he fails, as
Poet Wills fails when he is left to
himself; but, with Mr. Ibving, or
Mr. Habb at his elbow, what better
acting plays, on the whole, have
we seen in our time than Charles the
First and Olivia t Mr. Wilkie
Collins was successful at the Prince
of Wales's under the direction of
Mr. and Mrs. Bancboft, and with
Mr. Coghlan as the repulsive hero. Mr. Chables Readb also will be
remembered by his novels, not by his plays, and we feel sure that
for a Novelist to be a successful Dramatist, he must have the aid—
more or less—of some practical collaborateur experienced in stage-
craft.
A LILLYPUT LYRIST.
Lines in a Newdigatt Calendar.

Anson defying the Critics.
There was a little poet
In a little lyrio way,
Who scribbled most industriously
For very little pay.
He was tall, but not good-looking,
With a most romantic name.
And the Ladies dearly loved him,
And he took their praise for fame-
In days gone by at Oxford
He d gained the Newdigate,
And his career was settled
From that auspicious date.
For Oxford's got the contract
To supply one Bard a year
Even though divine afflatus
. May be natter than their beer.
And he read his little lyrics,
As they circled him about.
And they sighed and softly asked
him.
Would he kindly write them out.
And they flattered him past
measure,
Till this little bard began,
To consider Robert Bbowning
Was an overrated man.
An d he trilled and twittered feebly,
In a tiny tender treble,
Though at times the sense grew
vague,
And the rhythm would turn
rebel.
So he scribbled hour by honr,
And he toiled on day by da
Piping onwards towards Par-
On his little lyrio way.
But the path is rough and bitter
To the Muses' high abode,
And suoh little wand'ring min-
strels
Get few coppers on the road.
So he left Parnassus' Muses
For the muses of M ay fair,
Turned leoturer and grew to be
A Knight and milhonnaire.
And he writes for weekly papers
Where his inspiration makes
Terse as mild as Marten Tup-
per's,
Or as mad as Billy Blake's.
And his fame became so world-
wide
That fair Lily Langtry smiled
No more upon the sonnets of
His rival, Oscar Wilde.
And Ash n y Sterry sings no more
Of frills, and in despair
Poor Oscar Wilde has out his
throat—
No; not his throat I—his hair.
And our little Poet munohes
His daintiest Gallic gateau,
While his little "Tea-Tray Trio-
lets"
Is the last success with Chatto.
Take warning, then, ye Bardlings,
By the career of boys
Who think that they are Meltons
If they only make a noise.
It'» better to be butchers,
And not to ting at all;
But if you must be Poets,
It's better not to Ball,

CLEAR THE WAY!
Punch, to certain Obstructive Old Persons : —
Stand aside, if you please! Artry worthy old souls,
But indulging to-day in obstruction vexatious.
The world, struggling onward to common-sense goals,
Must give hearing to counsels more cool and sagacious.
A singular pair, in chance company thrown;
Both hotly and blindly intent on imposing
For ever the (hackles that Man has outgrown,
Keeping open old wounds which sound sense would be doting.
Stand aside, if you please! Though you eye with chagrin,
And with fussy aifright, what you deem an intruder,
Mere uninspired Man's manufacture of Bin
Breeds a tyranny neither the Turk nor the Tudor,
In essence, e'er equalled; and Law that would lay
On our lives a whim-bred artificial restriction,
Is the law of an ancient and bitter-bad day,
Built on private caprioe, not on common conviction.
Why, Manning, turn baok on the sense of your prime?
Why, Besson, turn face from the dawning of daylight?
'Why brand honest need as unnatural crime r
Why block blameless gleams that humanity's way light?
These Bogies of Bigotry weaken the guard
Of the Right's truer sentinels all would fain strengthen.
Each vain prohibition pure heart may discard
Forms a link in the chain only tyrants would lengthen.
Stand aside, if you please I Here Society's sense
Than mere clerical cant speaketh clearer and stronger.
Kept back over-long by sophittical fence,
Plain instincts of Nature should truckle no longer
Te vetoes non-natural, working sore pain,
Or impurity sore. Though your skirts you upsoramble
In peevish disgust, your resentment is vain,
Yain anathemas fervent and wild skimble-skamble.
"Thouoht-Readikg."—It is the simplest thing in the world.
Anyone with the command of a shilling can acquire the power, and
outdo Mr. Irving Bishop. The latest edition of Happy Thoughts,
illuminated by the glow of a Furniss, may be purchased for the
ludiorously absurd sum of one shilling, and so any possessor of this
Coin may become at once a Happy-Thought Reader.
IN THE SEASON.
"Rest !" cries the Business Man, mid toil and strife;
"Rest! " mid her balls and parties, cries his Wife;
But neither gains it mid the whirl of life.
The Fish Exchange (Blaokfriars) Bill was thrown out by the
Seleot Committee on Wednesday last. What prospect could there
be for any Bill at this Season, which, in consequence of its locality
being Black-fryers, was understood to exclude Whitebait?

Oh, how hard 'twill be for Members, if, before election time,
We are told our English virtue, hospitality's a crime;
And that in eleotion contests you can never be a winner
If you ask your friends to breakfast, or to luncheon, or to dinner.
So no wonder Henry Wioanr, of East Staffordshire, declares
That he's nervous when intent upon all hospitable cares;
And 1

May you give a friend a sandwich, but not ask him in to dine f
May you treat him to cold water, but deny him any wine f
And regard as contravention of this most Draconic code a
Glass of sherry and a seltzer, or a brandy and a soda P
You can't ask the little children of constituents to tea,
Without feeling a petition the direct result would be;
Buns and muffins—now, 'tis painful, but we fear it quite the faot is—

A "WORD IN THE SEASON
TO THE NEW PICCADILLY
WATER-COLOUR WORKS.
Everyone is delighted with
the New Water-Colour Exhibition
when they get there; hut as, to
arrive at the Galleries, necessi-
tates a terrifio ascent of no end of
a staircase, such of the visitors as
resemble Samlet in being fat and
scant of breath, or who are like
Mariana in the Moated Grange,
"aweary,"—in which case we
strongly reoommend strawber-
ries and cream at the Moated
Grange's, not many doors off,
before attempting the climb—
bitterly oomplain of the extra
exertion in search of High Art.
The Art shouldn't be so high,
specially as the ration d'etre of
this new Sooiety was to bring
Art within reach of all. The
advantage of course is that
scaroely any one of the Public
can visit the Piccadilly Water-
Works without puffing violently,
and of course a young Institu-
tion requires an occasional puff.
For ourselves, we shall always
be delighted to "give them a
lift," as long as they deserve it.
But, in this instance, the Man-
aging Committee would do well to
set the example by giving them-
selves a lift, or a double lift—no
charge for oarriage—whioh should
take the visitors up to the Gal-
leries on the second floor, and
deposit them safely. Depend upon
it, this is sound advice, though
it may seem to be rather a long-
winded—but therefore impartial
and disinterested—way of putting
it.
One great advantage of being
able to marry your Deceased
Wife's Sister is.'that you only have
one Mother-in-law.—" Pam."

NOTES AT COMMEMORATION.
An Overtight. — When the
Publio Orator, the Rev. W. W.
Merry, commenced his Com-
memoration Oration, the Under-
graduates who, in the Gallery,
were Over-Graduates, forgot to
sing out—
"We are a Merry family;
We are! we are! we are!"
An opportunity for a chorus lost
for ever, or, at all events, for
some time to come, unless they
serenade the P. 0. before the end
of term.
That was a neat mot of the
"Merry Professor's" when the
march from Scipio was played,
and he remarked that this illus-
trious Roman was noted for being
a very temperate drinker of
African wine, whence his sobri-
quet, Sippy-o' Africanus.
Mr. Nichols, of Balliol, won
the Newdigate with a poem about
"Inez be Castro," who, it was
understood, was a relation of the
notorious Claimant. "But," as
the "Merry Professor" said,
letting off a real side-splitter,
"Ought'un to choose such a
subject?" "When his audience
remembered that the Claimant's
name is Orton, they were con-
vulsed with laughter, and it was
some minutes before they reco-
vered their equanimity.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED PROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Monday Night, June 11.—House of Lords crowded to-night.
Question is, "May we marry our Deceased Wife's Sister?" Lord
Dalhousie says "Yes." Lord Cairns says "No." House appa-
rently pretty equally divided; that is, if we take in the Bishops who
crowd their benches. Prince of Wales on oross-benehes, so is Duke
of Connaught and Duke of Albany. Princess of Wales from
Gallery above smiles impartially upon the just and unjust. Prince
George and Prinoe Victor by her side. Both thoroughly oonvinced
in favour of Bill. "Tell you what. Toby," said Prinoe Victor,
"When I'm King I'11 make those Bishops sit up. If I oatch'em
interfering with legislation in this style, blocking the way when
majority of House of Commons, and majority of Lay Peers in favour
of a Bill, it won't be Seven I '11 send to the Tower, but Twenty-Two."
Nice straightforward, outspoken young man, Prinoe Victor. So
is George. Wanted to swap knives with me. Quite surprised to
hear I never carried one. Pressed on me bit of twine, two alley taws,
an old thimble, and bit of cobbler's wax. Said there was awful fun
to be got out of the latter. Mentioned possibility of secretly approach-
ing Speaker's Chair and accidentally leaving compound there. Told
him I would look up precedents.
Young Princes, like everyone else, chiefly delighted with speech of
Lord Bramwell.
"Most remarkable person," said the Primate, turning round to
gaze upon him. "Like a bull in a china shop. Not my idea of a
judge at all. Coleridge nearer the ideal."
Lord Coleridge himself deeply shocked at his learned brother
making jokes on such a subjeot. Didn't quite go the length of
reproving him, but with half-olosed eyes, tone of melancholy in his
voice, and head gently oscillating, lamented his levity.
"Remember old Pecksniff shaking his head oyer John Westlockf"
young Victor whispered to brother George.
Great oheering when figures announced, showing Second Reading
carried by 165 votes against 158. Barring Bishops, this is good
working majority of twenty-seven.
Lively night in Commons, Randolph broke loose again. Accuses
Government of complicity in judicial murder of Suleiman Sami.
"Managed that pretty well, Toby, doncha think f" he asked me
later. "A little bothered at the outset. Atone time thought the
Government would interfere to save this infamous Pasha, who smokes
his cigarette whilst Alexandria is burning, and goes whining and
fainting to the scaffold. Meant to make it hot for Gladstone con-
niving at escape after full trial. Then they hang him, and I had
on short notice to recast speech. But would do anything for my
country and my party."
Business done.—Annuity Bills for Alcester and Wolseley
wrangled through.

recently than yesterday, to-day been chiefly devoted to that inter-
esting country.
"Ireland," says Sir Chablrs Dilke, "was dearly foreseen in
Joseph's dream—not Joseph Oillis, but the earlier Statesman.
Ireland is the lean kine which swallows up all business in the House
of Commons, and is no better after the meal."
To-day began with Belfast. Private Bill on, to do something to
harbour. Joseph Oillis complained of constitution of present
Harbour Board as being too aristocratic. Seems they wash, their
hands and face more than once a week, put on clean linen on Sunday,
go home sober, issue no threatening notices, and were never known
to shoot a landlord or stab a juryman. J. G. would hurl these
haughty placemen from power, and make general qualification of
constituency similar to that which recently elected Mr. James
Cabby on Dublin Corporation.
Discussion continued, for two hours. All eyes fixed on Speakbb.
Momentary expectation that he would discover evident sense of the
House, and put stopper on Joseph.
"If cloture ever to be used, we shall see it now," Sir Stafford
Northcote whispered to Grand Cross, whom I always forget to call
Sir Richard.
But Speaker made no sign. Ventured to hint to Right Hon.
Gentleman as we were smoking a oigar together after half-past seven
dinner what had been expected of him.
"AH very well for you fellows, Toby," says he, "to fret and
fume. But there is something due to me. I am here day after
day, hour after hour far into the night, and must have my recrea-
tion sometimes. Nothing more soothing to me than voice of Joseph
Gillis. Feel invigorated and wound up for night's work after
couple of hours' conversation by Joseph and his Brethren on snob
subject as Belfast Harbour. Of course, it's little awkward for
public business; but we must average that. I must live; and if I
find rest and recreation in this way, what does that matter to you?"
Speaker a little cross, I thought, but day hot, and House sure to
be made at nine o'clock. He's quite right; and, though we can't
understand source of enjoyment, too much to grudge it to best
Speaker known to this generation.
Business done.—Three lines of Corrupt Practices Bill passed
through Committee.
Wednesday.—Quite a quiet afternoon, although first Bill was an
Irish one. McCoaw moved the Second Reading from benoh below
Gangway on Liberal side. Used to settle national affairs from front
benoh below Gangway opposite, but thought it judicious to move.
"Don't care to have a fellow like O'Kelly behind me," he says.

Mr. Ramsay took advantage of absence of interesting topics in
House to devote hour or so to Home-Skcrbtary. Remarkable sight
to see Grandiose Old Man button-holed, or led about by Ram-
say. 'Twas not always thus. Was a time when the Member for
Falkirk was treated as ordinary Members, particularly Scotch
Members. But Mr. Ramsay not to be easily shaken oil. One after-
noon Grandiose Old Man, strolling out of House, stroking his chin,
and giving other evidence of being sunk in profound thought.
Ramsay, just entering, accosted him. G.O.M. passed on as if he
were bodily in the clouds. But Ramsay not a man to be trifled with.
Old Covenanter blood up. Seized Habcocrt by sleeve, and,
forcibly pulling him up, said—
"Aye, aye! surely a Scotch Member may speak to a Secretary of
State/'
And he did. Since then, pretty to see Grandiose Old Man, when
entering Lobby, anxiously looking round to see if Ramsay's about.
Will take any bye-way to escape him: but, once those shaggy eye-
brows bent upon him, and those well-known accents in his ear,
becomes docile as a child, and yields without a struggle.
Ramsay, having conquered, is merciful. Kept him only an hour
this afternoon, whilst sketched plan for new Scotch Ministry.
Thursday.—At work on the Corrupt Praotioes Bill. Soothed and
inspired by presence of Mr. Charles Lewis. Not seen much of
him of late Sessions. Been usefully employed in United States,
Mr. Macartney tells me, in interests of his constituency. Back
again now, and buckling to work with old energy. Has always
oome out strong on question of purity of election. His famous White
Waistooat first dazzled House of Commons nine years ago on question
of issue of writ for some peccant borough. Now, when Bill is pro-
posed for enforcing purity of Election, Mr. Lewis naturally to .the
fore, though the White Waistooat is a thing of the past.

woman. But though "White Waistcoat flames no more, all the
grace and culture of which (taken in conjunction with the square-cut
black coat and trousers to match) it was the emblem, remain. All
very well for Attornet-Genbrax, who is in charge of Bill, and
resents delay, to state openly in the House that Mr. Lewis is repre-
sentative of Solicitors who are threatened with diminution of bills of
oosts by operation of the proposed Act. Everyone knows that Member
for Derry is influenced by no other motive than the desire for purity
of Election, and the prevalence generally of the Good and the True.
Sir Trevor Lawrence tells pretty story in support of his Amend-
ment. Parson writes to him on behalf of congregation, intimating
that they think Liberals and Conservatives much the same thing,
specially Liberals. What they regard as of much more importance,
is to free their chapel from debt. "Those who give most," writes
this model Pastor, "are regarded as our best friends, and thereby
will be influenced about two hundred votes."
"Now, that," said Mr. Gibson, "is a Btyle I like. No beating
about the bush, but comes direct to the point. Two hundred votes
going to the highest bidder. Boxes will be held at the door, and
voluntary played on the harmonium whilst competition goes
forward.
Committee inclined to take matter seriously, and Sir Tbevob
Lawrence's Amendment, designed to check Pastors with evenly-
balanced minds, likely to be accepted.
Business done.—Carried Clause One of Corrupt Practices Bill.

Rip Van Winkle.
A CHARITABLE THOUGHT-READER.
About three thousand persons were assembled last week in the Great
St. James's Hall to benefit, by their guineas, five-shilling-pieces, and
halt-crowns, that excellent Charity, the Victoria Hospital for Sick
Children. These three thousand would-be benefitters of the afflicted
infants had also another aim in view—they had come to see a really
genuine good stand-up "row " between Mr. Bishop, an American,
and the Senior Member for Northampton.
Mr. Bishop, when he appeared, was self-possessed, but indistinct.
Finding this, the half-crown benefitters of afflicted childhood seated
in the back gallery shouted savagely to him to "speak up." Mr.
Bishop did "speak up," and proceeded to form what he called "a
Committee." He nominated Mr. George Augustus Sala and the
Bishop of Newcastle to belong to this indefinite body, but neither of
the "inseparables" just mentioned condescended to put in an appear-
ance. However, a Volunteer Colonel, an ex-Chief Constable, an
innocent-looking old Clergyman, and last, but unquestionably not
least, Mr. Waddt, Q.C., M.P., did step up, and take their Beats on
the chairs which Mr. Bishop said he had reserved for them. Then
the "Thought-Reader" had a good deal to say about Messrs.
Labouchere and Firth, of an uncomplimentary character, and the
charitably-disposed towards suffering babyhood yelled with delight.
But when he proceeded to expose some well known "spiritualistic
tricks " the audience were less satisfied.
"We have paid our money to see the Thought-Reading!"
shrieked an infant-soother, "and we don't want anything else."
Then what the newspapers usually "call a " soene of indescribable
confusion " ensued, until oil was poured upon the troubled waters by
the eleotion of Mr. Waddt, Q.C., M.P., to be Chairman. From this
point the talking was incessant. The Chairman, having once broken
the ice, seemed to be never tired of taking the audience into his con-
fidence. He walked from side to side of the platform, smiling through
his speotaoles, and holding up his hand to the now very noisy and
very angry friends of the children, to demand their attention. At
length Mr. Bishop said he would find a pin, and Mr. Lane Fox was
deputed by the rage-maddened audience to hide it. He did conceal
it—in an opera hat.
Mr. Bishop, after being blindfolded, seized upon the "Eminent
Electrician," and, casting aside all considerations of personal dig-
nity, hurried him hither and thither about the hall. At last the
"Thought - Reader" stopped, and, after declaring he could do
nothing with his companion, slapped his (Mr. Bishop's) forehead,
dived down under a chair (accompanied by Mr. Lane Fox), and
returned (accompanied by Mr. Lane Fox) holding the opera-hat in
which was stioking the now safely-reoovered pin.
The fickle friends of invalided childhood roared with applause.
For the moment Mr. Bishop was the popular hero, and everyone
regarded Mr. Lane Fox (again, only for the moment) as a personal
enemy of several years' standing. The " Thought-Reader" returned
to the platform, and again Mr. "Waddt, Q,.C., M.P., resumed his
harangue. But an earnest sympathiser with the exalted objects of
the Viotoria Hospital in the body of the hall objected to anything
further being done until Mr. Bishop had discovered the number of a
"fiver" of which he (the earnest sympathiser) proudly declared
himself to be the owner. His suggestion was received with howls of
execration.
Then Mr. Waddt, Q.C., M.P. (whose flow of talk"seemed to be
interminable), with uplifted hand and eyes smiling through spec-
tacles, suggested that Mr. Bishop should guess the number of a
bank-note which, although belonging apparently to Mr. Russell,
Q.C., had, somehow or other, got into the possession of Professor
Rat Lancaster. Mr. Bishop wavered. Upon this, the not-to-be-
too-greatly-trusted-alleviators-of-the-pains-of-infancy turned
upon him like one man, and savagely jeered at him. Then Mr.
Russell, Q..C, angrily left the Hall. This proceeding caused fresh
shouts of hate, whioh only subsided when it was found that he had
left his note behind him. Professor Lancaster explained that he
was the happy possessor of the valuable tissue-paper in question,
and refused, on any consideration whatever, to part with it. And
as this bold and determined announcement seemed to cause the
Entertainer much annoyance, the audience applauded the Professor
to the echo.
I heard subsequently that Mr. Bishop did tell the number of a
note belonging to a Gentleman who was rather coldly received as
"the friend of Mr. Stanhope, M.P.," after a great deal of bickering
and arrangement. But let that pass. For, in or about the time of
the "Lancaster incident," our Entertainer announced that any of
afflicted childhood's wealth-bestowing friends who wanted their
money returned might have it back on applying at the Oflioe.
Acting upon this suggestion, 1 rose stealthily and left the Hall.
And now a most remarkable specimen of "Thought Reading"
occurred. Just as 1 imagined I had a guinea (the price of a stall)
well within my reach, the attendant at the door discovered that I
was turning it over in my own mind that I, personally, had not
paid for admission. "Well, well, I did not get the money. "What of
that—the Viotoria Hospital is an excellent Charity!

House of Commons, Monday Night, June 18.—Mr. I!right " been
saying things " down at Birmingham. Mr. James Lowthkk shocked.
Lord Randolph horrified. Mr. Chaplin indignant. Agree that
Sir Stafford must do something. Sir Stafford not quite sure about
wisdom or safety of course suggested.
"People living in glass-houses throwing stones, and that sort of
"you know," he murmured. But Truthful James insistent.
there's one thing I can't bear," he says, "it's strong lan-
_e. Let us, above all things, be_ moderate. We differ from
tlemen opposite on matters of opinion; but don't let us there-
fore accuse them of maltreating their mothers-in-law. Bright's
example might be followed by younger Members like Rylands and
Dillwin, if left unrebuked. Fraotioe might spread. Might reach
even our side, and then think of disgrace to our cause 1"
Sir Stafford Northcote still doubtful, but yields to argument,
and here's Mr. Bright to-night dragged up for judgment.
"Brought a sheet with you. John?" the waggish Wilfrid said
as the Birmingham Heavy Weight appeared. Got a candle in
your pocket P You '11 look well standing at the Bar doing penance."
Turns out to be a mistake somewhere. Penance last idea in John's
mind. "Seems," as Sir Charles Forster says, "leg's on other boot."
The Conservative Party are had up for punishment, whilst the Irish
"rebel" Party get a slogging, under which they shont and toss in
impotent pain. Even the blameless Randolph is seized by oollar,
and roughly shaken. Grand Cross in terrible trepidation. Almost
piteously begged for " something the House could accept as apology."
"I thought we'd better have left him alone," says Sir Stafford
Northcote, wishing it were over.
In excitement of moment no one answered Mr. Marum's conun-
drum. Mr. Marum a gentleman with red face and inoffensive
manners. When he suddenly sprang up in interruption of Premier,
House painfully surprised. Didn't expeot such a thing of him. But
Marum once aroused not easily quelled. Insisted on right to speak.
House yelled "Order!" Mr. Marum defiantly shook his head.
Irish Members cheered madly. Speaker rose. Premier resumed
seat. Marum still on legs sternly faoing uproar. A lull. Then
Marum speaks.
"Is it in order," he says, amid silence appalling by contrast with
recent uproar, "that the Prime Minister should assume that no
one should speak from these benches when they have not got the
opportunity of speaking as they are prepared—or not?"
House paused a moment, trying to master this remarkable pro-
blem. Giving it up, burst into a roar of laughter, that lasted
several minutes.
"Captain Bunsby, by gad I said Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice.
"The bearings of this observation lay in the application on it."
An alien Legislature might laugh; but Mr. Marum had posed
them. Let them answer hiB conundrum, or honestly give it up.
Business done.—Agreed to one Amendment on the Corrupt Prac*
tioes Bill.
Tuesday Night—Lyon Playfair (whom really don't know
VOL. LXXXIV.
whether I ought to call Sir Lyon) delivered another interesting
lecture. Subjeot not attractive. Small-pox, in fact, which, on the
whole, is a little worse than vivisection. But the lecture so
fascinating that unpleasantness of subjeot lost sight of. Lecture
lasted Professorial hour. Benches rapidly filled up. Students
most orderly. No shuffling of feet, coughing, or other noises,
though plenty of applause. Peter Taylor sat on back bench,
shaking his head, and taking voluminous notes. Pretty to Bee the
pitying smile of Mr. Hofwood, as he regarded the applausive crowd.
"Wonderfnl simplicity about this House, Tory," he said to
me. afterwards. "A little learning goes a far way with them.
Will believe anything, if figures are quoted, and scientific illus-
trations introduced. I could have rolled up Playfair in ten
minutes. But wasn't worth while; and perhaps House wouldn't
have heard me. They don't like real erudition."
Great hue and cry after Mr. Mayne. Gone off with Sir Arthur,
Hayter's hat. Sir Arthur, worn out with departmental work,
and attendance on House, falls asleep in Library. Pats his
hat on table; new one last week. Cost guinea-and-half. Rather
proud of it. Division-bell rings; wakes up; seizes hat; fancies
it's limp. Looks again, and discovers it's positively decrepit, and
hung round with habiliments of woe, in shape of crape band.
Polioe inquiry. Howard Vincent comes down. "Who was in
room when you fell asleep?" "Only Mr. Mayne."! Examine hat.
Find A. M. written inside lining. Cordon of Police thrown round
the House. Police boat off the terrace reinforced. Search for
Mayne. Can't be found. Look out for him next day. Doesn't
turn up. SuspioionB deepen. Richard Power, threatened with
arrest as accomplice, confesses he's gone to Monaghan on Electoral
business. This looks serious. Question whether to oanvas votes
in new hat of Minister of the Crown is not corrupt practice.
"Anyhow," says Mr. O'Sullivan, "it's a very Mayne trick.
I Hayter thing of that sort."
Sir Ch*rles Forsier, soon as he heard of it, called to pay visit
of condolence to Sir Arthur. "I know what it is to lose a hat,"
said the Hon. Baronet, with tears in his eyes.
Business done.—Anti-Yaccination craze received death-blow.
Wednesday.—More conundrums from Irish Members. Mr. Shiel
wants to know what section of Irish Party O'Donnell belongs to. This
worse than Marum's. House gives it up on the spot. O'Donnell
himself quite taken aback. Thinks Shibl should have given notice
of question. Answering off-hand, he should say he represents
Frank Hugh O'Donnell; in brief, he's the Fifth Party.
Terrible young man when once roused, is young SaiEL. "Looks
as if butter wouldn't melt in his mouth," says Joseph Gillis,
admiringly, "and yet he goes for O'Donnell. Neat hit that about
using the stationery of the Irish Parliamentary Party to write letters
to newspapers. Must cultivate Shiel'b acquaintance. Wonder if
he's partial to mild breakfast-bacon. Looks as if he was. Shall
send him half a side." Business done.—Irish.

Got up early this morning. At door of Committee before twelve.
Whenever Conservative Member approached with intent to enter
room, Wabton offered him pinch of snuff. Member took it.
Curious effects follow. Great drowsiness came over him. Began to
yawn. Showed strong disposition to sit down on floor. Mr. Warton
offered arm. Gratefully accepted. Led Member off to neighbouring
Committee-Room not in use. Helped him to a chair, and left him
there. Turned key in door. Went off to watoh for another Member.

would take Committee to finish Bill. Presently Members began to
stroll in. Come in twos and threes, looking horribly sleepy, com-

late at night. Quite sleepy at middle of day; must have Committee-
Room better ventilated.
Too late to save Bill. If Members won't come in to make a quorum,
what's the use of struggling with it? So Bill abandoned, and

THE BRITISH ARMY—PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE.
(In three short Essays.)
Essay No. I.—On the English Soldier in the Past.
Evert Regiment was filled with the outcome of the gaols, and the
country depended for a second line of defence upon a compulsory
Militia. The men spent their whole lives with the oolours. They
were either kidnapped, or decoyed into the Army. They joined
wearing bonds of drink, or chains of penal servitude. For ail this
they won Blenheim, Plassey, Alexandria, and Waterloo.
Essay No. II.—On the English Soldier in the Present.
The constitution of the Army, nowadays, is changed annually.
I'or the moment the recruit is enlisted for short service, then
passed, into the Reserve, then recalled by a large bounty to
the oolours to fill up vacancies. By this simple means the Reserve is
turned into a farce, and long service is re-established at a con-
siderable additional outlay. _ Recently, all eiprit-de-corpi has been
destroyed by giving the Regiments new titles, and thus crossing out
with a stroke of the pen the memories of a long list of British
victories. But the names have not only been altered. The colour of
the uniform is to be changed from red to drab, and the standards,
onoe proudly borne aloft, are to be permanently abolished. More-
over, the Militia are neglected, the Yeomanry ignored, and the
Volunteers laughed at. The men of the Regular Army are treated
like slaves—they are passed from the Regiment they prefer to the
Regiment they dislike, without the smallest regard to their feelings,
and everywhere the Queen's livery is accepted as a badge of dis-
grace. In fact, the British troops of the present day are mis-
managed, overworked, and insulted. In spite of this they were
defeated in South Africa.
Essay No. III.—On the English Soldier in the Future.
There will be no English soldier in the future!
OUR OFFISHIAL GUIDE.
Part VI.—Conclusion.
Before leaving the great Fisheries Exhibition, it is the duty of
every visitor to' partake'of the celebrated Sixpenny Dinner. This
obligation is generally admitted, as the orowd standing before the
barrier in front of the economical refreshment room amply proves.
All that is required by the would-be diner is patience. However, as
a guide should be, if not "a philosopher," at least "a friend," it may
be as well to describe the prooess, pour encourager let autrei, who,
on this occasion, may be said to be represented by the luxurious, the
impatient, and the wasteful.
Golden rule—" First get your sixpenoe." Have it ready in your
right hand, so that it may be tendered at exactly the proper moment.
Armed with your coin of admission, you can join the struggling
throng of miscellaneous humanity who continually press onwards
towards the door leading to the plates of cheap fish and boiled
potatoes. You will have ample leisure to study that grandest of
subjeots (according to Pope), your fellow-man. By degrees you will
get nearer to the long-looked-for portal, and then the rumour will
reach you that the Public are being admitted in batches of twenties
and thirties. By-and-by you will work your way to the spot sacred
to the presence of a conversational Policeman. Then you will obtain
your first glance of the banquet whioh is the object or your greediest
aspirations. How you will hate the dawdlers who play with their
bread, or trifle with their beer I Unless you are qualified by natural
sweetness of disposition for oanonisation, you will mutter a curse as
you watoh old women taking five-and-twenty minutes to discuss a
fried slip, and twice as long to tell a seemingly uninteresting story
to their kith and kin. You will find the presence of the conversational
Policeman quite an acquisition. With a little encouragement, he

will tell yon all his sorrows; how long he has to stand at the door,
how hot it is, or how oold, until at last yon will almost be compelled
to force a shilling into his honest hand. . Restraining yourself with a
mighty effort, yon will not tip the blue-coated representative of the
Law. In spite of your virtue thus honourably exhibited, the Police-
man will not become more reticent. Nay, it is possible that, on the
contrary, he may even describe to you the terrors of the pangs of
thirst. But all things must come to an end—even a wait before the
doors of the Sixpenny Dinner, and the sorrows of a conversational
Policeman. Of a sudden a Gentleman will appear at a turnstile, and,
with the permission of the perspiring representative of the Law,
you will enter with a rush, after hurriedly exchanging your sixpence
for a refreshment-ticket. You will sit down at a table with a dirty
cloth, and, after several attempts to claim attention, at length oaten
the eyes of an overworked young person in a cap.
"Boiled or fried'?" the overworked young person in a cap will
ask, as she hurriedly passes you. You will reply, and if then you
answer " Boiled," you will be supplied with a mass of fish oovered
with melted butter; if " Fried," you will receive a gigantio helping
of something brown. But not at onoe 1 Oh, dear, no! You must
wait your turn; and, token the smoking dish is set with a jerk on
the dirty cloth in front of you, you may rest and be thankful! How-
ever, while you are still dinnerless, an occasional glance at the weary
faces outside the barrier will cause you to thank your lucky stars
that you have at least "got in." But, when you have eaten your
sixpennyworth of fish, bread, and potatoes, it may possibly occur to
you that the game may not have been exactly worth the candle. On
leaving, you will be possibly told that the dinners are supplied
at a loss, borne by the Baroness IScudett-Coutts. Of course, this
is satisfactory, so far as it goes—but, emphatically, no further. Six-
pence for a hot wait, a dirty oloth, and a plate of fish is extremely
oheap. It will be as well to bear in mind, however, d propos de rien,
that some things which are oheap are also nasty 1
And now our task is done. Among the miscellaneous articles of in-
terest in the Exhibition may be enumerated some stuffed fish in cases
and a very good sort of custard-powder. There is also a pleasant
bookstall, where you can buy paper-covered novels. Besides these
exhibits there is an Aquarium, which has but one fault. To quote a
Lady's opinion anent it, " The tanks would be charming if they
didn't contain fish!"
One word of advice in conclusion. Don't try to see everything,
hut be satisfied with what seem (in the eyes of the Public) to be the
principal objects of interest. And here is a model programme, which
if followed, will secure the desired result:—
10 a.m.—Entering the Exhibi-
tion. Sit down and rest.
10 15 a.m.—Looking at Lady
Brasset's feather-cloak.
10 30 a.m.—Examining the fuh
knives and forks made out of
lobster shells.
10 45 a.m. — Glimpse at the
Prince of Walk's Pavilion.
11 a.m.— Waiting for admission
to the Sixpenny Dining-room.
12 noon.—Ditto.
1 p.m.—Ditto.
2 p.m.—First mouthful of Six-
penny Dinner.
2 5 p.m.—Last ditto of ditto.
2 10 p.m. — En route for the
Bandstand.
2'15 p.m.—Arrival in the Hor-
ticultural Gardens.
3 p.m.—Still waiting for the
Band.
4 30 p.m.—Enjoying the Band.
7 p.m.—Home.
In conclusion, as a general rule you should avoid nets, shun life-
boats, ignore fishing-rods, and give a wide berth to tinned provisions.
If, however, you are perverse, and will try to master thoroughly the
various entries in the Official Catalogue, why then, unless your brain
be bother-proof, you will run a good chance of qualifying for admit-
tance to the excellent establishment so honourably associated with
the name of Dr. Newikqtok. Briefly, if you will attempt too much,
you will commence with "sunny ocean," and end with " lu-na-oy 1"

nounced deoidedly against the Channel Tunnel. They consider it
dangerous. Both are excellent soldiers — Cela va sans dire; and the
above expression of opinion goes to prove that they must be also

four hundred and forty-one performers! Why forty-one? "Why
couldn't he have left it at a round number, and stayed away? But
some people never know when they
are not wanted. I fancy that forty-
first man—the "odd man out"—
must have been the performer on a
side-drum who broke loose (quite
enthusiastically) twice on the first
day, getting well away from the
chorus, and keeping two bars ahead
till pulled up by Mr. Manns. If
Mr. Manns had had another con-
ducting-rod by him, that forty-first
man would have known it. What
could have induced this extra per-
former to present himself when the
round number of four hundred and
forty had been arrived at f There
are some people who never know
when they are in the way, and here
was an instance in point.
While all the approaches to the
Palace by road and rail are thronged,
the Palace gardens are deserted. At
a side-door an idle waiter is smoking
a quiet pipe. On the approach of our
party he tries to look as if the pipe had got into his mouth much
against his will, and turns away from us as if to admire the view.
He, at all events, does not seem in the least excited by the grandeur
of the occasion. Our party of three enters by a way leading into the
Aquarium, up a damp and melancholy staircase, where are some old
ragged and half-faded advertisements on the walls, and some
mouldy-looking submarine rocks
in a glass case,—suggesting the
idea of neglected fish having
lived and died there, in sheer
despair of ever being noticed by
anybody. Evidently this staircase
is not much used. On the landing
there are the usual turnstiles, and
a man in authority who appears
surprised at seeing us. He nar-
rowly scrutinises our party, and
carefully examines our tickets
before committing himself to the
assertion that it is "all right."
Having obtained permission,
whioh, by the way, is grudg-
ingly conceded, we enter the
building by the Conservatory,
and suddenly find ourselves
between two lines of people drawn
up in military fashion to receive
somebody of importance. There
was a murmur of "Here they
come!" as we strolled in, followed by a dissatisfied antistrophe
of "No, they don't I " accompanied by suoh looks of resentment and
such expressions of disappointment as convinced me at once that it
wasn't our party which had been anxiously expected.
In the distance I catch a glimpse of Bome persons, not, apparently
from this point, many, and I begin to wonder what has become of
the Handel Festival, when
my ear catches the laBt notes
of " God Save the Queen,"
which, from the Conservatory
door by which I am still
standing, Bounds as if it were
being sung by one person to
a weak viol in accompaniment.
The Royal Party, expected
to arrive here (or, if not, why
these two rows of spectators
marshalled by occasional
police ?), have, as a kind of
practical joke, entered by
another way, and have taken
their seats, where I subsequently get a good view of them, in a sort
of magnificent Doll's House, beautifully furnished, with the front
part opon and no staircases inside. Here they sit, looking in the
distance (everything from where my central seat is, is in the distance,
more or less, to me) like the dolls themselves, elegantly dressed; the
Prince of Teck being very much en Evidence as a very round, com-

up aloft, to keep watch for the
life of poor Jack.'

fortable, fresh-coloured doll in morning costume, such as may be
seen in any model gathering in the window of a big toy-shop in
Regent Street, or at the corner of the Rue de Rivoli.
The first part has commenced as I pass in and am searching for
my chair. I turn round and take in everything at a coup d ail.
There is Mr. Manns conducting, with his face to the Chorus, and his
baok to a bust, presumably of Handel. The Sculptor had evidently
taken the great Composer unawares just as he had got out of bed,
apparently after a hard night
of it, for the bust looks dread-
fully bilious, and the nightcap
has a rakish, devil-may-care
sort of air—suggeBtive, in fact,
of anything but the sort of air
we are accustomed to associate
with the name of Hansel.
On Mr. Manns's right sits
Madame Tbebelli in a morn-
ing dress, without a bonnet,
looking as if she were quite at
home, and intended making a
day of it. Next to her is Signor
Foli, who, when not vocalis-
ing, appears to be amusing
himself by making faces at no
one in particular. On Mr.
Manns's left sits Mr. Maas,
looking as much at his ease as
a gentleman at a banquet who,
unaccustomed to public speak-
ing, has been informed that, in the absence of some popular indi-
vidual, he may be called upon by the Chairman, at any moment, to
return thanks for the Ladies.
A polite official whispers something in my ear as to the position of
my chair. He repeats it. I cannot catch it. Once more he repeats
his information louder. "My dear Sir," I reply to him, "if you
will only stop that Chorus "—which at this moment is singing a jovial
sort of air, the wor3s of which sound to me something like "Bob
merrily" repeated over and over again—" if you will only get that
Chorus to be quiet for one second, I shall be able to hear what you
are Baying." The Polite Official smiles, shrugs his Bhouldere, bows,
points to block B, and, referring to my ticket, I pass on, and arrive
at my destination.
8ignor Foli rises in his place, and sings " And I wilt shake"—
which he does to any extent. The effect conveyed to me by this
batio profondo shake is the notion of a convivial Gentleman who
having come away, in a very happy state, from a late supper, and
having somehow lost his way in an underground passage, is trying
to make the best of the situation by attempting as much as he
can remember of a jovial chorus in whioh he had recently been
joining.
It occurs to me that Mr. Manns is considerably annoyed by a
screen, placed between himself and the elevated Organ-man who is
perched up aloft like " the sweet little cherub who keeps watch for
the life of poor Jack "—{Happy Thought—suggestion for a Kate
Greenaway Fishery picture)—over the
top of which appears from time to
time the head of a Policeman in a
helmet, reminding me of the scene in
Macbeth when "the apparition of an
armed head rises." The Policeman
peers about cautiously, his movements,
as far as I can judge from the head
and shoulders, being very much like
those of a Punch doll worked from
below, or of one of those dummy
figures employed, also behind a screen,
in Lieut. Cole's Ventriloquial Enter-
tainment. Once I think he catches
Mr. Manns' eye, and so energetic is
that eminent Conductor's aotion, that
the probability evidently occurs to the
Policeman of his catching something
else—Mr. Manns' baton— at his head, if
he doesn't disappear; and so, discretion being the better part of valour,
he does disappear accordingly. He comes up again, however; only
the head and shoulders, of course—surreptitiously, but being
invariably deteoted, and immediately baffled by Mr. Manns' energy
in any attempt at giving an entertainment on his own account
(iust to lighten the Festival), he instantly makes a sort of apolo-
getic bow towards the Conductor—who is not to be softened by
this—and vanishes.

mences, and we are "all in to begin."
I come to the conclusion that the repetitions in an Oratorio are
tedious. After a grand Chorus, enter on to the platform Madame
Aliuni. Applause from audience, chorus, and orchestra. She
wears a bonnet and elegant walking dress, and has quite the
surprised and pleased air of a lady who, happening to be passing
by the Crystal Palace at the moment,
heard some music going on, and has just
looked in to see if she could be of any
use. Finding a few thousand persons
here, she has kindly consented to give
them a song, but steadily refuses to join
in a chorus.
Mr. Santlet uproariously greeted—
that is, uproariously for a Handelian

we all rise for the '" Hallelujah Chorus,"

festively, of course—with all the old
spiritual and physical fervour which Eton
boys used to throw into their rendering
of a popular psalm-chaunt in their College

nowadays more honoured in the breach

And all is confusion, one hardly knows why:
The perils of passengers, frequent and wonderful,
If crossing the roadway they venture to try.
They get in a muddle,
And stand in a puddle,
They 're terribly frightened when drivers shout " Hi!"
And lucky's the rover,
Who sometimes gets over—
Without a smashed hat or a shaft in his eye 1
See broughams and Victorias, 0, it is pitiful,
And horsemen jammed in as they go to the Row:
And busses paoked tight on their way to the City full,
With pole upon panel and wheel upon woe!

It's no use to worry,
And if yon grow frantic, you '11 find it in vain;
You've this consolation,
On reaching the station,
You '11 find you've succeeded in missing the train!
When hopelessly blooked in the traffio vehicular,
And coachmen each other begin to abuse;
And blatant 'bus-drivers are scarcely particular
In choice of the language they frequently use!
When horses are sliding,
And drags are colliding,
And carriages crawling at scarce a foot pace—

to a fashion article in a recent number of the Daily Telegraph, is
"white doves' wings," of which the writer says, "Fashion has pro-
duced nothing so chaste [Faugh!] for some time ": and considerately
adds, that it would be better taste only to wear two or three, as
"half-a-dozen is the average number now chosen!" We speak of
the " gentle sex" when we mean the fairer portion of humanity, but
Ladies will not deserve the epithet if they cling to these cruel

purpose of supplying suitable means of
communication between the outlying sub-
urbs and the Royal College of Music, has
entered into a contract with a well-known
firm of mechanical piano-makers, for the
construction of twenty of their new recrea-
tive vehicles. As they will all at each
revolution of the wheel rapidly repeat an
elegant and original melody arranged for
not less than three strings, and as a distin-
guished European Conductor will accom-
pany each journey, it is confidently believed
a recourse to their use will materially
stimulate the musical taste of both inside
and outside passengers. N.B.—The atten-
tion of investors is specially directed to the
fact that as the hind wheels of the Com-
pany's Omnibuses have, with a view to the
praotical illustration of an occasional perfect
cadence and inversion at intervals, been left
purposely loose, there is every reason to
believe that when the scheme is in full
operation, the annual turn-over will be con-
siderable. For further particulars apply
to the Secretary."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CLERICAL DISCRETION.
On the part of "the oppo-
nents of the Deceased Wire's
Sister Bill," a morning paper
declares that'1 they have great
reason to complain of the trick
which has been played them
by its promoters. That trick,
so called, is simply the intro-
duction into the Bill in Com-
mittee of a clause enabling
(not compelling) Clergymen to
solemnise the marriages which
the Bill sanctions in churches.
What is the objection to this
most fair and equitable pro-
vision? That " it will throw
on every parson who may ob-
ject to officiate, the onus of
justifying himself in not doing
that whioh an Act of Parlia-
ment says may lawfully be
done." But how much can
that onus weigh P His justi-
fication will be that the law
allows him to officiate or
refuse, as he thinks right.
The olause complained of is a
conscience clause for him, and
surely the onus it imposes on
him is not an ounce—indeed,
is less heavy than a scruple,
or even than a grain. Besides,
what is the permission of
Clergymen to celebrate the
marriages which an Act of
Parliament appoints Regis-
trars to effect, but a j ust allow-
ance of the liberty to use their
own discretion, if they have
any, as probably very many
of them will be found to have,
with respect to a ministration
which they conscientiously
account not only lawful but
right? In fact, it is a sort of
Parliamentary Dispensation
Clause.

A PLATFA1R TO THE RESCUE.
If there is one scientific fact more certain than another, one that
has been proved beyond the reach of cavil or controversy, it is the
efficacy of Vaccination as a preventive of small-pox. Thus, when
Mr. Pbtbb Taylob got up in the House of Commons, one day last
week, and said that there was a mass of testimony to show that
Vaccination was a failure, he stated that which was not the fact.
And when he added that small-pox had increased since Vaccination
had been compulsory, he said, with all due respect to the Honourable
Member, that which was not true. We are not sorry, however, that
these monstrous mis-statements were made, for it gave Sir Lyon
Platfaib an opportunity of drawing his lancet, so to speak, and
smiting Messrs. Taylob and Hofwood hip and thigh. A man, as he
said, had a perfect right to procure for himself an attack of small-
pox, if he lived entirely isolated; but he had no such right, if he
was a member of a community, to make himself, either in person or
by deputy, a focus of contagion.
Well might Sir Charles Dllke say that, after the speeches of the
Anti-Vaccination fanatics, his own feeling was one of astonishment
that, having been frequently vaccinated, he was still alive; and the
House showed its full agreement with Sir Lyon Playfaib, for only
sixteen Members sided with Mr. Taylob—crotohetty Radicals most
of them like Mr. Cowen, for example, who belongs to one party and
always votes with the other. The large majority of 270 has, it is to
be hoped, settled the question for the present generation at all events,
and the terrible scourge of small-pox will still continue to be suc-
cessfully combated by the immortal discovery of Jenner—one of
the greatest gifts bestowed by Providence upon suffering humanity.
SONGS OF THE STREETS.
THE POLITE POLICEMAN AT HAMILTON PLACE.
[Sings.)
What will you do, Ma'am, when you are going—
With smart dress flowing—towards the Row i
What will you do, Ma'am, with all the hurry,
The crush and worry ?—I don't quite know I
When people sourry, and cabs advancing,
With horses prancing their conrse pursue;
Don't take alarm, Ma'am; you '11 take no harm, Ma'am;
But take my arm, Ma'am—I '11 see you through!
What will you do, Ma'am, when Hansoms clatter,
And panels shatter, and drivers swear f
What will you do. Ma'am, with horses sliding,
And drags colliding ?—You 're in despair!
But gently ohiding, with voioe seraphic,
I stop the traffic, at once for you I
So come, you see, Ma'am, in charge of me, Ma'am.
I want no fee, Ma'am—I '11 see you through!
A Real Harfy Thought.—Mr. John Thohas's—the Bard's—
Concert, with an Orchestra of Harps. What an entertainmentdfor
the " Welsh Harp" at Hendon, if he had only happened to think of
it at the time.
