PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"T DRAW, and am not 'drawn,'" said Mr. PUXCH, with significant, though courteous sententiousness.
J- Brother JONATHAN cast his eyes, gloaming with appreciation and an imminent joke, around the Sage's " snuggery."
"W»l, Siree," said he, winkishly. "I don't know about 'drawn,' but I 'II be hanged if you are not comfortably
'quartered.'"
TOBY, who was enacting the part of canine Ganymede, for the occasion, yapped suggestively.
"I guess the genius loci inspired me that time, TOBY," said JONATHAN, accepting, and appropriately applying, a
tumbler of (sophisticated) hot water. "But won't you come, Mister PUNCH ?" he continued, entreatingly; "wou't you really,
now, old hoss?"
"Too old a 'boss* to be 'trotted out," friend JONATHAN," returned the Sage, with a genial wink.
"Why, everybody, who is anybody, stumps the States, now," pursued Mr. PUNCH'S visitor, persuasively.
"Zero multiplied by a million is—zero," remarked Mr. PUNCH, oracularly.
"The bearings of that observation lie in its application, I suppose," said the American, after a pause and some digital
manipulation. "I confess I can't quite 'cipher it up' myself."
"How many WILDES make a—precedent?" queried his host, pleasantly.
"Oh! pass OSCAB, and—and JUMBO," said JONATHAN, showing his teeth. "Preposterously puffed Pachyderms, both 1"
"BABKUM'S Big Show is not confined to the Pachydermata, I presume," said Mr. PDNCH, suggestively.
"But I 'm not touting for the Big Showman, you know," responded JONATHAN. "Pyramids and six-foot posters. No!!!
I 'm on my own hook, I am. I invite you as the great ^/itt-Humbug. Law and Literature, Beauty and Beauty's lisping
Parasite, Grotesque Art and Lucid Culture, all have had their turn. We are a Big Country, Sir, and we like to have a look at
"em al]. If your Madame TUSSAUD could get her whole collection animated, a la PYGMALION'S statue, and just send 'em round
posing or preaching, or lolling or lecturing, we should rayther relish it. We can't have too many opinions upon the
Atlantic and Niagara Falls, upon New York City and ligneous Nutmegs, upon Democratic Manners and the Republican
Outlook! COLEBIDGE wasn't half bad, and IBVINQ is more than half good. But we yearn for you, Sir!"
"Very natural and proper," said Mr. PDNCH.
"Then you 'It come?"
"The inference is precipitate. All natural yearnings are not to be gratified. The child yearns for the Moon. You
Americans yearn for the 'Stars'—our 'Stars.' You have had a perfect galaxy of them 'cavorting round' amongst
you lately. But the Star of Stars is not a Wandering Star."
The American gentleman looked disappointed.
"Wai, Sir," he pursued, after a pause, devoted to deglutition; "it's mighty good of you to allow me to interview
you here. I suppose I am at liberty to"

"Libbaty's a kind o' thing That don't agree with—interviewers" interjected his host, pleasantly. "My good friend
LOWELL—his health !—will pardon the adaptation, I 'm sure."
"But," continued the pertinacious Yankee, " if you travelled with me, you could have your own special ' Inter-
viewer' and Opinion Collector. Vox stellarum— the Voice of the ' Stars,' as Old MOORE hath it—can now be transmitted
10 the Public through the ' Star's ' private phonograph, as it were. And just fancy what a dazzling sensation you would
be! NORMAN LOCKYKR'S wonderful sunrises wouldn't be in it with your auroral avatar!"
"You will not get that particular ' rise ' out of me," responded Ma. PUNCH, with decision. "There 's a flavour of
BABNUM about the whole business uncongenial to the soul of PUNCH."
"Himself the great original Showman!" subjoined Brother JONATHAN, slily.
"And, therefore, not requiring to be 'run' by any other 'Boss,"" added MR. PUNCH, quietly. "TOBY, another
tumbler!"
"Sounds as if he were in the acrobatic line."—(Tony gave a sly pug-chuckle all to himself.)—"Would he come?'
inquired the American, gazing admiringly upon the Dog of Dogs.
"TOBY," said MR. PUNCH, " is as Cosmopolitan as his Master, and as indisposed to be exploits. TOBY loves your
country, as I do. Witty LOWELL, and delightful ABBEY, and beautiful MARY ANDERSON sharp Alti. PUNCH'S warmt st
ngards with classic ARNOLD, and honeyed COLERIDGE, and weird IRVING, and witching ELLEN IERRY. But I cannot follow
them to the platform or the Stage."
"I guess, Siree, you're just tarnation particular, the platform has already had'a pretty fair show. It has been
brushed by the wing of PEGASUS. It has been graced by the sock of MELPOMKNE and the buskin of TQALTA. Even the
»ig of THEMIS has disported thereon. Icon-elude that in time it will have trotted out all the Graces, and most of the
Muses, with a good square contingent from the Olympian Upper Circles. But the baton and bells of the modern MOMUS
are, it appears, to be"
"Conspicuous by their absence. Precisely BO," completed Mr. PUNCH, politely.
"Wai," said the American, rising reluctantly, " what must be, must be. But our people will be disappointed, you
bet. You '11 send 'em your love, and—well, no—not a lock of your hair, I suppose," added JONATHAN, airily.
"I will do more, Sir," said the affable Sage, beaming effulgently upon his wistful guest. "I will send them my best
representative, ray spirit's quintessence, my voice of voices, my alter eyo. Take it! it will brighten your voyage home! It
will not disappoint you as the Atlantic did OSCAB! You will find it pleatanter than pop-cDrns, and more exhilarating than
Hop Bitters. It is more portable than JUMBO, and brighter than a Fashionable Beauty. It will give you more sound
judgments than COLERIDGE, and more sweetness and light than the Gospel according to MATTBEW ARNOLD. It will make your
peace with the insatiable ' Platform,' and save you from the Interviewing EBINNYES. Finally, it will bless you and all men,
without Barnumising them. Take it, and be happy!!"
And Mr. PUNCH presented to the delighted American hia

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ALL AT SEA;
OK, THE PILOT, THE PKKR, AND TUB PREDICAMENT!
(A Story dedicated, icit/ioul tJifir pcrmiaiun, to the Lurda of tlie
Admiralty.')
HUB Majesty's steam-ship Joyful was gaily careering before the
wind, oil the coast of Ireland, in a chopping sea.
"HI can but escape the Sow and Piggies," murmured the Admi-
ralty-elected Pilot, all may yet be well. The dreaded rocks in
question should be here—that is, if I understand the chart rightly."
And the mariner anxiously regarded the horizon, and gave a new
order to the eager crew.
"I must speak with you at one*?," cried a person who had ascended
from below. "You must immediately hug the shore."
"Hug the shore!" echoed the Pilot (who was somewhat inexperi-
enced) , doubtfully. "Why should I hug the shore?"
"Because it is his Lordship's wish," continued his visitor. "You
understand—his Lordship's wish, conveyed to you by his Lordship's
Hairdresser."
The Pilot bowed respectfully, and nervously gave fresh orders to
the crew. Still the ship rocked to and fro, and was anything but
steady. The Hairdresser had retired, but his plaue had been taken
by a second official.
"My fellow, why you not do what Milord he vant?" asked the
new-comer, sternly. "Milord he say you not hug the shore
enough."
"What have you to do with it?" asked the Pilot, angrily.
"Who are you?''
"Who am I? Ma foil How it please me! Who am I? Why,
of Milord his French Cook!"
On hearing this, the respectful mariner dropped upon his knees,
and gave fresh orders to the crew, which were obeyed with alacrity.
But soon the place of the "cordon bku " was taken by another of
Ms Lordship's household. In turns the Valet, the Coachman, the
Librarian, the Chaplain, the Travelling Tailor, the Consulting
Dentist, and the Cigarette-Maker put in au appearance to make the
same request—" His Lordship was most anxious to get nearer to the
shore, and trusted that the Pilot would be able to oblige him."
Accordingly, again and again the Joyful changed her course, and
turned her bows towards dry land.
"Sir, you are trifling with us!" at length said a young man of
commanding appearance who had taken the place of the others.
"You are trifling with us! His Lordship is still suffering inconve-
nience. Yes, listen and tremble. I am his Private Secretary, and I
tell you so. Ho is absolutely suffering inconvenience!"
yo, no!" cried the Pilot, with his hands before his tear-be-
dimnied ey¥s.
"But I say, Yes, yes. You have not hugged the shore nearly
enough."
"With the Sow and Piggies before us, it would be unwise to go
nearer—there might be danger," and the Pilot wrung his hands in
despair.
If you didn't there would be danger of his Lordship being"
and the young man of commanding appearance whispered the rest.
"Anything rather than that!" shrieked the Pilot, beside himself
with respectful horror. "Ease her! Stopper! Turn her astarn, and
port your helm!"
These orders were promptly obeyed, and five minutes later 'there
was a crash, and the Joi/fiil lav wrecked upon some jap-gsd rocks.
Clinging to a masthead appeared the Pilot talking to a Peer of the
Realm.
"Oh, my Lord; this is too much! I am not worthy of such an
honour!" and the Pilot actually blushed with pleasure.
"Pardon me'; you arc worthy of the honour, replied the Peer of
the Realm, firmly; and he shook hands for the second time with his
untitled companion. "I repeat, I am personally obliged to you."
"No, no-^-my Lord, my Lord, how can I thank von!'"
"I require no thanks; on the contrary, you have deserved my
respect—nay, gratitude—yes, gratitude," and the eyes of the noble
filled with tears. Mastering his emotion, he continued, " Yes; the
gratitude of the whole world is most justly your due; for, had you
not lost your ship by hugging the shore, the Earl of HACKJTEY Dowirs
might have been—sea-sick!"
A BLOW FOR THE BLOWHOLES.
THE RAILWAY VENTILATOBS.—Before the Select Committee, Mr.
SPlJiNEDGE examined: Is a practical chemist, and a Shareholder of a
Railway Company; also a frequenter of the Thames Embankment,
in relation to that magnificent Terrace, considers the Ventilators
vast improvements. Thinks them both useful and ornamental at the
same time. Ornamental not only in an architectural sense, but also
by reason of the products of combustion of coke and coal, which issue
from them in steam and smoke, and in so doing so gracefully curl,
as the poet sings. Useful, too, in virtue of those same ingredients—
the disinfecting gases and vapours they exhale, which include fumes
of carbonic acid as well as carbonic oxide, and sulphurous acid, and
sulphuretted hydrogen. Believes that their exhalations likewise
contain a very considerable proportion of ozone, an aeriform sub-
stance of acknowledged remedial agency in bronchitis and asthma.
Is aware of the meaning of the Virgilian word, "Mephitis ;" sup-
poses it meant Afepliistopfieles, and considers that expression, applied
to the sanitary and odoriferous effluvia of the Ventilators o i lie
Thames Embankment, a reckless calumny. Is accustomed to send
his children to that open space for change "of air.

THE HEAL "BIEKBECK" INSTITUTION.
THIS should be the title of the Fisheries Exhibition at South
Kensington, where Messrs. BIBKBECK have done so much for the
meral good. When our young man had finished compiling his
Hshial Guide, we went to see the show, and have no hesitation in
recommending it to everybody as the place par excellence where to
spend a Happy Day.
On entering, you will see something "lent by the Princess of
WALES "—we forget exactly what it is, but it is very kind of Her
Royal Highness, and we hope it will be returned all safe and sound—
["safe and sound," like a cod in a refrigerator] —and that the children
will not have missed it very much.
The pictures are, of course, rather piscatorial, but they are to the
purpose, and that s something. Pass on—do all the models—and all
the departments, not staying too long in the waterproof and oil-skin-
Sshing-wrappers' place, which, like the skull in Hamlett "smells so!
pah! and made us feel so ill, as it conjured up reminiscences of a
dusty passage " and the sailors bringing unpleasantly odoriferous
waterproofs, <Stc., that we could only just stagger across to the
refreshment room, and call faintly for an American drink. Then,
like an enfeebled giant slightly the better for a glass of anti-Lawson
beverage, we lighted a cigarette, with a Sir-Henry-Thompson holder
Jour own patent, about which we shall make a great cry, but there's
nowooP" in it), and strolled out into the Horticultural Gardens,
where the Grenadier Guards' Band was playing, and the people—the
real people—thoroughly enjoying themselves. They applauded discri-
minatingly, and encored hcartilv. There were our Country Cousins
and our Sisters and our Aunts, all looking hot and happy in the Sun, or
cool and comfortable under the shade of the wide-spreading trees.
Here the old glories of the Polytechnic are revived, and there is a
real Old Diver going down in at least four feet of water. I fancy
he is stooping to hide himself, and then standing up erect to appear
as if he were coming up again, with a great deal of trouble, from the
vasty deep. The effect is good, and safety is an object. So is the
Diver an extraordinary object. But we love him, and next time we
can get near him we will be Polytechnic boys again, and chuck him
a copper. An immense crowd was gathered round the basin where
the Diver was washing,—we mean bathing,—and the junior portion
evinced a strong tendency to throw him buns, under the impression
that he was either a seal or a bear. Ah! the Children's Education
is sadly neglected now that there is no longer a Polytechnic!
The diving operations were most interesting as long as an official
in charge of the man in the iron mask—we mean steel helmet—was
tying him up as if he were a Davenport brother, but the excitement
cooled down when the enterprising operator had disappeared from
view, and his helmet had ceased to afford a clear mark lor the sur-
reptitious nut. There was a sort of half-expressed hope that the
Diver might not come up again, which gave a languid interest to
what would have been otherwise a very dull five minutes while the
Diver wag under water. The Band and the lounge, however, are,
and will be, the great attraction.
Now, why on earth cannot these Gardens be continued just as they

midnight? Bands playing turn and turn about; electrically lighted;
no fireworks, except on a rare fete day perhaps, and with the kind
permission of Cromwell Road and South Kensington generally, but
luncheons, teas, dinners, and suppers at all prices, and at all hours.
Then, if it rains, in they could all go under cover, and the Concert
could be continued inside the building, with smoking and coffee
among the plants and Conservatories. This is what London wants,
and this place could be made a Summer and Winter Garden instead
of its being given up to "building purposes," and the life smothered
out of it by mountains of bricks and mortar.
The BIRKBECKS have done a good deal here for which all Londoners
have much to be thankful. Now let them get H.R.H. to lead the
way (it is all to advance the interests of Music, who, "Heavenly
Maid," is still " young") and this ground may yet be rescued to be
one of the grandest and most enjoyable of all the projected open
spaces for the people (" Open Spaces," your Royal Highness; more
in the Musical College interest, with several refreshment Bars' rest);
that is, for those who can afford a Shilling in any one of five days
out of the six, to go in and spend a happy day and evening too.
Then on Sundays let it be opened free, a boon to all who cannot get
out on any other day or night of the week, and let a first-rate Band
be supplied by the Royal College of Music.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED *KOM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, June 25.—Asked RANDOLPH
was it true he was going to Gasteim in first week in August. Ad-
mitted accuracy of report. "Why Gastein, and why first week in
August?"
"Ah, TOBT !" says he, playfully pulling my ear, "there's no get-
ting over you. You know everything. But I hope you won't say
anything about it."
Said I certainly would not. Pledge given with more confidence
since I didn't know anything. Hadn't the slightest idea what he
was at. But grinned and looked knowing.
"Yes, TOBT," continued his unsuspecting Lordship, thoughtfully
arranging .his moustache, "You've hit it, and I'm only afraid that
when people notice that Emperor of ACSTBIA and Emperor of GEB-
MANT ar» to be at Gastein in the first week of August they will put
two and one together with natural result of making three of it.
Emperor WILLIAM insists upon my joining the conference this year.
FRANCIS-JOSEPH sees importance of it. You are old, Father WIL-
LIAM,' the younger Emperor cried, 'and the future is to the young.
Let us have RANDOLPH on our side, and we '11 make all Europe sit
up.' But I shall be cautious, TOBY. You may trust me. Care no
more for an Emperor than I do for a Bishop or Home Secretary, and
that you know isn't much. There are many things taking place, or
about to take place, in Europe, it would be just as well to have a
clear understanding about. Been so muoh occupied of late on home
policy, had no time to look up foreign affairs. But have not for-
gotten them. Mean to travel incognito. There would be awful
rumpus in Russia and trouble in France if they knew what was in
the wind. Not quite sure how Portugal would take it. So, for
goodness sake, don't you mention it."
Said I wouldn't, and I won't.
Still on Corrupt Practices. Fatal subject to start. Every Member
full of special information on the case. No one would suppose PETEB
had any knowledge of corrupt practices. In fact, he emphatically
deprecated any, but told the Committee a good deal about the epi-
demic of butchers' carts that broke out during contested Election at
Warrinpton, and had much to do with result. Every Member has his
personal experiences, relates them at length, and Clause stands aside.
"Experiences accumulate, and the Bill's delayed," as SOLICITOB-
GENT.RAL savs.
Business done.—Passed Clause Five Corrupt Practices Bill.
Tuesday.—Lord REDESDALE sometimes accused of coercing House
of Lords. Remember Lord BEACONSFIELD one day saying to me,
"REDESDALE is the only man I fear. Would any day rather drive a
pig to market, or ride the length of the Row on an obstreperous
donkey, than have dealings with him."
STBATHEDEN tells me (and CAMPBELL confirms statement) that
REDESDALE has been offered more appointments in foreign parts than
any Peer of his age.
"DIZZY entreated him to go out and govern India; Earl GRAN-
VILLE has induced GLADSTONE to offer him Canada; whilst there
isn't an Ambassadorship, with the exception of Paris, not been
pressed upon him from tune to time."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"No." says his Lordship, shortly. "If I were to leave, the House
of Lords would go to pieces in a Session."
So stops in town, turns up with painf id regularity every afternoon,
takes Chair in Committee, sits on Woolsack in absence of LORD
CHANCELLOR, and snaps round wherever he be.
"No school lives in such terror of Head-Master as House of Lords
does of Earl REDESDALE," says the Earl of WEMYSS, who is new to
the place. "Even BOBBY LOWE is quelled, and daren't open his lips."
To-night Lord REDESDALE in new mood. Generally when he nas
proposition to make, claps it down on Table, prowls out "There!"
and regards with awful visage the trembling circle of noble Lords.
To-night, haying Resolution with respect to alteration of Standing
Order prohibiting payment of interest out of capital, took quite new
line. Don't be frightened," he said, bringing down his ruler with
a crash uncomfortably near knuckles of Lord AUCKLAND, who had
Amendment on the paper, and happened to be standing by Table.
"It is true Motion stands in my name, and in ordinary way you
would agree to it without wasting time'in talk. But to-night speak
out freely. Give me your independent opinion on the question.
Lords couldn't believe this at first. Thought it was a trap, and
that anyone who spoke would be instantly fallen upon with ruler.
Lord HOUGHTON ventured a few remarks, but was so agitated as to
be quite inaudible. As he was not eaten up, Lord AUCKLANB moved
his Amendment, "and," as Lord DUNRAVEN observed, "like TOM
MOORE'S Freedom,'still he lives.'" When LORD CHANCELLOR, keeping
well out of arm's length of Chairman of Committees, ventured, with
Ms eye on the ruler, to differ from tLe Resolution, and nothing
happened, noble Lords began to see it, and Lord CAIRNS, who had, of
course, supported the Motion, be^an to tremble. Lord REBESDALE,
though he had submitted the Motion, did not want it earned. When,
by cautious feeling out on part of LORD CHANCELLOR, this was
established, it became plain sailing. Everybody (including the
Government, who had supported it in the other House) went against
Motion, which was negatived without Division.
_" A fine set of bovs," said REDESDALE, as he returned the ruler to
his trouser-pocket. '' But they want managing—they_want managing."
Business done.—House of Commons still dallying with Corrupt
Practices Bill.
Wednesday.—Lot of Members went off down the river to the Tower
to see the improvements. Pleasant journey. First Commissioner
came out handsome with tea and shrimps served by marge of river.
"As near as we can get to Marge-gate, you know." he said, plea-
santly, as he helped himself to another slice of bread-and-butter.
Seems a pleasant interlude in the week, but Mr. HICKS very
gloomy on the subject. Says there's more in it than meets the eye.
Always feel inclined to call him "HICKS Pasha" since that name
turned up in the East. He would look well in a fez. In fact he "d
look well in anything. A trifle annoyed just now; perhaps Hicks-
asperated.
.It's the thin end of the wedge, my dear TOBY," he said. "It's
beginning ab oro. Once let it become a matter of custom that Mem-
bers shall get into steamer at river steps, and be carried down to the
Tower, and difficulties removed from the path of imperious minister
like GLADSTONE. Some time critical Bill on. Perhaps for abolition
of Bishops. Second Reading fixed for a Thursday. On Wednesday
afternoon First Commissioner comes smiling round, inviting Members
of Opposition to take trip down the river, see the Tower, and accept
some light refreshments. They unsuspectingly accept; when
Thursday comes, and Division Bell rings, Opposition absent. I may
be wrong, or I may not: but when I take tea and shrimps it shan't
be in company with GLADSTONE and his myrmidons."
Mr. WARTON stopped behind with Mr. HICKS, and as soon as
steamer out of sight counted out House.
Thursday.—" Pater's a little dull," RANDOLPH said, as we stood
below bar in House of Lords, listening to Duke of MARYBOROUGH.
moving rejection of Deceased Wife's Sister Bill. "W. H. SMITH would
have done it better; CROSS couldn't have done it worse ; STAFFY would
have shone by comparison. And to think what pains I took with him!
Put him up to the reference to CHAMBERLAIN s speech at Birming-
ham. 'Where shall I bring it in 'f' says he. Anywhere, where
yon f«el stuck,' says I. 'Sure to fetch 'em.' But he gets stuck in
wrong place, drags CHAMBERLAIN in head and shoulders, and the
Lords laugh instead of cheer."
RANDOLPH very wrath. Expect the Dnke will have a bad
quarter-of-an-hour when he gets across him.
Debate not relieved from dulness even by Duke of ARGYLL, who
crows and flaps his wings with usual energy. Bishop of EXETER
delivers sermon of ordinary twenty minutes' length, but interrupted
by uncanonical cries of Divide!" LOBD CHANCELLOR, his voice
streaming with tears, renews protestations against the Bill.
Great excitement as the surpliced Bishops pass out to vote against
the Bill—a thin white line in the throng of black-coated Peers.
Whisper gone round that they have sold Lord DALHOTTSIE. Led him
to believe Opposition yielded. Kept quiet on going into Committee;
accepted compromise in Committee; made no fight on report stage;
let it be understood that Division on Third Reading was merely
formal protest. Friends of Bill, lulled into false security, did not
turn up as they had done at Second Reading. Duke of GoNNAr/OHl
gave dinner-party; perhaps Peers went to his house instead of to their
own. Consequence is Bill thrown out by Majority of Five.

A Mntch sit Lords. "Out I—Third Bull!"
"Think we've done a pretty good day's work," says Bishop of
LINCOLN to his Right Reverend brother of Exeter.
"Yes; but not for ourselves, I fancy," says Dr. TEMPLE, who has
not lost all his clear-sightedness since he became a Bishop.
Business done in Commons.—Votes in Army and Navy Estimates.
Friday.— Commons still harping on Corrupt Practices Bill. Get
along at the rate of two lines of Bill a day. At this rate, and in
absence of unforeseen accident, hope to get finished by middle of
November. At evening sitting, HAHCOURT brought in Bill to make
new Scotch Minister.
"It is not," he said, with wave of right hand, "a grandiose
measure."
House tittered. Truthful JAMES audibly whispered: "No; but
what a Grandiose Old Man!"

Suppose my Committee is composed of Ladies, that all my agents

Suppose they limit their operations to bribing the electors' wives only.
Under the law which now secures the acquisition of separate property
to married women, can it be that those who bribe them will be held
also to bribe their husbands? If not, then how will it be possible
for women to bribe women—for non-electors to bribe non-electors?
In order to secure absolute puritv of election, will it not, therefore,
be necessary to supplement the Corrupt Practices Bill by the eon-
cession of I emale Suffrage?

ELECTORAL PROGRESSION.
THE Corrupt Practices Bill, as
•voted by the House of Commons,
altogether forbids treating, and
totally prohibits the payment of
expenses for the conveyance of
voters. As long as the former of
the two interdicted practices was
lawful, the latter was in a great
measure necessarv to give it
effect. The majority of the Elec-
tors who had been treated to their
hearts' content were in such a
condition that it would have been
impossible for them to record
their votes at the polling-place if
they con Id not have been carried
thither from the public-house.
They will in future oe subject to
no influence calculated to oblige
them to ride in order to poll, or
to occasion them to vote, or to walk
either, otherwise than straight.

A VERY NARROW MAJORITY.—
The Majority of five in the House
of Lords against the Deceased
Wife's Sister Bill. No majority
could be narrower.
THE NEXT LORD MAYOR INTERVIEWED.
IN consequence of the intense excitement caused in Civic circles bv
the reports of the interviewing of the next Lord Mayor, Mr. Punch
has telegraphed to the reporter of the New York Herald, and is
now enabled to publish the following additional interesting par-
ticulars :—
Mr. Alderman HADLEY is a gentleman of commanding presence
but affable demeanour, and reminded us muchly of the late General
JACKSON. He is about fifty years of age, and unmarried. We
report this last interesting fact for the Denetit of the unmarried
Ladies of the Fifth Avenue. The next Lady Mayoress of the City
of London, who, as is well known, takes precedence, on all State
occasions, next to the Princesses of the Royal Family, and is allowed
by the wealthy and generous Corporation the handsome allowance of
£10,000, or 50,000 dollars, a year for pin-money, and, in case of a
certain interesting event occurring during her reign, a solid silver
cradle, or two solid silver cradles in case of the double event, is still
un chosen.
Perhaps the greatest compliment ever paid to the Ladies of the
United States—the most lovely and accomplished of the whole
civilised world, as we all know—is the fact that the next Lord
Mayor of London has been requested by Her Majesty's Government to
spend a month or two among us, in hopes that something of an inter-
esting character might occur that would tend to relieve the somewhat
strained relations between the two countries at the present moment.
Upon suggesting this to the gallant Alderman as a probable solu-
tion of the reason of his visit, nis manly brow was suffused with a
modest blush, but he at once changed the subject, by asking what I
would drink. This afforded me the opportunity I had long wanted
of learning the opinion of a real London Alderman on the important
subject of liquoring up, and I availed myself of it to the fullest
extent, both theoretically and practically.
It appears, then, that the ordinary drink of an Alderman is '47
Port, which costs about a guinea a bottle. In former times the usual
quantity was two bottles a man, but in these degenerate days it has
declined to one. Any Butler or AVaiter shaking a bottle of this
costly llmil is at once dismissed without a character. No cork is ever
allowed to be drawn from a bottle of '47 Port, but each Member of
the Court of Aldermen wears on his forefinger a splendid diamond
ring, with which he cuts off the neck of the bottle, so that not one
drop of the precious contents should be spoilt.
He expressed great disappointment at our dinners. "Dinner,"
said he, "beingtrie important event of the day; must never, under
any circumstances, be hurried. Two hours is the least amount
of time that should be dedicated to this matter. A long experience
has enabled us to decide with certainty the wines proper to each
course. Madeira with Turtle. Chateau Yquem with iish, Cham-
pagne with Entrees, Burgundy with Game, and old Port with
Dessert, will enable any man to till any station to which he may be
called, with grace, wisdom, and understanding. To prove the truth of
my assertion, continued the gallant Alderman, " if prooi be wanting,
listen to this remarkable fact. Kings die, Princes die, Presidents die,
ay, even Aldermen die, but a Lord Mayor never dies. Despite his
hard work, despite the fearful responsibility that weighs upon him,
his regular living of five courses at dinner, each with its appropriate
wine, keeps him with a healthy mind in a healthy body, and he
retires at the end of his brilliant year in as splendid condition as a
favourite on the eve of the Derby."
I listened with becoming reverence to these words of wisdom, and
inwardly resolved, should the opportunity ever occur, to follow most
implicitly the directions so kindly given.
I then left the gallant Alderman and expectant Lord Mayor, with
the sad conviction impressed upon my patriotic soul that, although in
almost everything of importance we lick the Britisher, as we do all
creation, in the article of Alderman he wins in a canter, and with
both hands down.

THE THAMES NUISANCE.
LET every patient angler who loves to spend a few hours on the beautiful
waters of the Upper Thames, finding the delicious ripple of its gliding water so
calming and cooling to his weary brain—let every boating-man who glories in
one of the most fascinating and invigorating and healthy of exercises—let every
lover of the beautiful river-scenery that those waters offer to his view, an3
every Artist who glories in transferring them to his canvas, give three hearty
good cheers for the Thames Conservancy Hoard, and one cheer more for their
hard-working Deputy Chairman, Admiral Sir FREDERICK NICHOLSON!
Every fisherman on the Thames, and every boating man, and every boating
woman, knows what the one nuisance is that interferes so terribly with their
peaceful enjoyment, and, if asked to name it. they would shout with one accord,
'Steam Launches, badly managed!" And it is for more power to regulate
these headlong, tearing, noisy, and dangerous nuisances that the Thames Con-
servancy Board are applying to Parliament. The evidence tendered to the
Parliamentary Committee was so overwhelming that they declared themselves
satisfied before it was half heard. It included that of Fishermen, Artists, M.P.'s,
Literary Men. Members of Rowing Clubs, Eton Masters, &c., &c. The Fishermen
complained of the destruction of the ova and small fry, the Artists hoped their
brother Artist in his evidence " would give it 'em hot. The Boating-men spoke
of the nuisance and danger of the great swells caused by these great snobs; the
Eton Master, of the contemptuous insolence with which the grinning idiots
treated all attempts at remonstrance.
Of course, the Launches had their defenders. There were but two, however,
put of the 240 launch-owners, but they made up in quality for what they lackec
in number.
Sir GILBERT EAST, Chairman of the Steam-Launch Association, of course
considered everything perfectly satisfactory. "He had once spent a whole dav
in a punt, and every Launch that passed him ' eased.'" No doubt they did, anc
probably saluted their President.
Sir THOMAS NELSOX, Vice-Chairman, agreed with Sir GILBERT, of course he
did. He should consider the painting of a number on his beautiful mahogany
Launch, which was his hobby, an indignity. Was a Knight to be treated like
a mere Cabby, or a driver of an omnibus r The thought was too painful to be
dwelt upon.
_ After long discussion, the important clauses were mostly agreed to, and the
Bill passed through Committee; so we may reasonably hope to be able to have
_ day's fishing or a few hours' boating on the beautiful
waters of the Upper Thames without much danger of
>eing either upset, or swamped, or grinned at, or discom-
'orted by the loungers on board their hissing, smoking,
steaming, whistling, shrieking Launches.
Carefully steered Launches can be, if their owners or
lirers like, of great sendee to the small craft in towing,
ior example; and their advantages to those who wish to
make the most of the little leisure at their disposal are
obvious. To well-managed Launches there can be no
more objection than to dear old Maria Wood in all her
past glory.

If money you 've plenty to spare,
And want to buy presents galore,

Oh, toddle down Bond Street at Four!
In Art if you take a delight,
Of pictures you '11 find plenty there;

If snubbed by the girl you adore;

THE LORDS AND THE (OLD) LADIES.
FOR a time the obstructive "Old Ladies" of the Upper
House and elsewhere have their way. They have post-
poned yet a little longer the coming of what thev deem
the "evil day" when one more artificial and arbitrary
restriction upon personal liberty shall be removed. The
evil day! To the Old Ladies of history, the future has
ever appeared as a long perspective of evil days. And
if they had been successful in postponing indefinitely the
dreaded advent of those "evil days," how many good
days would history have shown? But they are never
successful, for very long—these fluttering, woe-invoking
Old Ladies, or progress would be an impossibility, and
the stream of history turned into a ditch or a duck-pond.
This "evil day," like so many others, will come, and
soon. It will be found—like so many others, again—to
be a good day.
The Old Ladies themselves will admit it, all in due
time. They will then have to cast about for some other
case in which irrational restriction does cruel wrong to
natural instincts and righteous needs. They will denounce
the removal of that restriction also with equal fervour,
and, in the long run, with equal fruitlessness. For the
instincts of Old Ladies do not change; they learn nothing,
and forget everything. They must have something to
oppose. An "evil day" is an essential of their moral
perspective, and when they have perforce to drop one,
they take up another. They will shortly have to drop
the " Deceased Wife's Sister1' Bogey. In the meanwhile,
they have the satisfaction—a strange one-H>f prolonging
for yet a little time the imposition of arbitrary^ prohibi-
tion, the existence of absurd prejudice, and the infliction
of needless pain. __

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AFTER IT IS OPEN.
(Being a little further important evidence, as given, in future, before At
"Channel Tunnel Closing Committee.")
The Duke of Hythe and Westenhanger's Opinion.
THIS great and distinguished soldier was yesterday examined at
considerable length before the Joint Committee of both Houses, now
sitting on this subject, and as his evidence, as will be seen below, is
in distinct contradiction to that tendered by him some few years since,
when called upon, as Lord WOLSELEY, to express his views as to the
desirability of constructing the Tunnel at all, it can scarcely fail to
be read with considerable interest by all those who have hitherto re-
garded the military verdict as unfavourable to this now almost
popular, if not easy method of avoiding the occasional discomforts of
the Channel passage.
He said, that he had now, after a varied, and, he might almost add,
a " lively experience of the working of the submarine communiea-
tion at present connecting this country with the Continent, to admit
that the judgment he passed upon the scheme in its infancy, appeared
to him not only hasty, but quite unsound. He opposed the construc-
tion originally as a soldier, because taking a soldier's too rough and
ready review of the situation, ho thought that an invasion or two
might follow; and probably do the country a considerable amount of
serious damage. And he was right thus far; several invasions had
occurred. But where, he asked, was the harm that had come of
them?
After the Bank of England had been five times emptied by an in-
vading host, it is true, there was a good deal of annoyance felt in
commercial circles; but, in his opinion, commercial men did not form
the true staple of the country. When he was a comparative youngster
in the Service, the British Army was a mere expensive toy, consisting
of but a handful of men. quite unfit to cope on equal terms even with
the smallest Continental power. The military man of those days
was, he granted, an insignificant factor in the national existence.
But look at things now. Thanks to the Tunnel that had made involun-
tary service compulsory on every male adult between the ages of
fifteen and five-and-sixty, vou never met a man out of uniform. The
taxpayer might, perhaps, hnd the expense a little heavy, still he had
something better than a toy to show for his money. Every man was
in fact a well-drilled, well-equipped, hard-worked soldier; and what
vith our three permanent second-class garrisons of 80,000 men at
i)r ver, Canterbury, and Pegwell Bay, who could but say that we were
re; dy to dispute the passage of the Tunnel again to-morrow with all
the spirit, and probably with more than the success, that we had met
with on the last sixteen occasions on which invading armies had
managed to force their way through it-!*- As for himself he had no
reason to wish that exciting risk averted. Did he not owe the very
title, of which he was so justlyproud, to tho memorable action in
which, under cover of the Lord Warden Hotel, he withdrew the 300
men who were protecting the coast from Westeate to Bpgnor, and
managed to get them in time to Hythe to cateh the last train to town,
and so bring the news that in the course of eighteen months roused
the whole country north of the Tweed to pass a resolution to the
effect that it was desirable to drive out the invader? He would
therefore be extremely sorry to see the Tunnel closed. Though now
a veteran, he still enjoyed the prospect of a good brush with the
enemy. He would be unworthy of his profession if he did not feel
something of this sort. His opinion was, therefore, that to block up
the opening as contemplated, would be to ruin the national spirit,
embarrass the War Office, and degrade the country to the position of
comparative military insignificance it too long was contented to
occupy in former times. At the conclusion of the noble and gallant
Duke a evidence, that produced some sensation, there was a slight
attempt at cheering made by a body of Army Contractors in the
lobby; but this was speedily suppressed. The next witness called
was Baron JoEJf BBIGHT, V.C. Subjoined is the illustrious hero's
evidence:—
Baron John BrighCs Opinion. ..
The Baron, who wore conspicuously on the breast of his surtout a
perfect constellation of orders, on taking his place at the table amidst
a respectful and sympathetic trash -which- was quill- remarkable, said^-
What he had to say on the subject of the Tunnel would be brief, and
to the point. He frankly admitted that he had once publicly advo-
cated-its-completion as a boon to those great commercial interests
that, notwithstanding the military distinctions that had been forced
upon him by circumstances over which he had no control, he yet
regarded as the fairest jewels in that Crown that aptly symbolised
a mighty nation's Imperial policy. He was not ashamed of this
apparent change of front. He once thought that as soon as the com-
munication was opened in the sacred nama and under the divine aegis
of those twin goddesses. Business and Humanity, the cotton
products in which ho was largely interested would be poured in a
continuous stream, and at a remunerative figure, upon the eager and
expectant Continent. But what, he asked, had been the upshot of
his dream?
He had seen, on the contrary, to his intense astonishment, a flood
of better, cheaper, and more useful articles whelm in from the other
side upon the defenceless markets of this country; and the Tunnel
that he, in his wild frenzy of progress, had fancied would simply
serve to fill the pockets of a few, had merely helped to diminish
the price of the necessaries of life for the benefit of the community
at large. This was the chief curse this vile engineering monstrosity
had entailed on the long-suffering people of the realm. Still, it had
involved another, and one scarcely less terrible, in its results.
Millions of- armed men had, in spite of the dictates of common sense,
the eternal principles of Free Trade, and the benefit of Manchester,
rushed through that nefarious subway to slaughter and enslave by
thousands.—he could hardly speak of it with patience,—the meek
consumer' And the marauders had not stopped short even here.
They had even sacked his own premises, and carried off his own
goods wholesale, without demanding the fiction of an invoice! This
had forced him into the very van of resistance. It was to the ter-
rible and bloody contests in which this attack upon what he might
term " his commercial honour," had hurried him, that he owed the
valour that had won him the insignia that now adorned his breast,
and the Continental distinction that even his enemies, no less asto-
nished than he was himself at his prowess, had attached to his name.
A great philosopher had said. Not till you pick a man's pocket will
you discover his principle. Whoever said that, was a wise man. He
and those who thought with him had had their pockets picked. And
what was the result? He appealed to that Committee to say if the
military organisation of the country could boast at that moment a
tougher or gamer set of dare-devil fighting cocks than the "No-
ftuarter-Peace-at-any-Price Manchester Fencibles "? (Applause.}
Of those " Fencibles he was proud to be the Colonel; and until he
got the good glorious old prices of former days back again, he would
never lav down his sword—no, nor sell his flag! (Renewed applause.)
He thanked the assemblage for that manifestation. It would encou-
rage him to persevere without ceasing until the Tunnel was either
battered in, blocked up, or blown to pieces, and the unpatriotic and
dastardly Shareholders relegated, if need be, to the gallows. He had
but one word more to say. Whoever urged that the Tunnel and its
promoters should not be thus summarily disposed of, was fit only for
Bedlam!
Upon the conclusion of the illustrious Baron's testimony, there was
a scene of considerable excitement, during which he was carried on
the shoulders of a few Manchester friends in triumph to the Horse
Guards. The proceedings were then further adjourned until to-day.
"EXITS AND ENTRANCES."
THE model theatre of the future will be built like a pigeon-trap,
with.sides that lift up and let down at the whim and fancy of the
audience. Chapels and churches will have to copy this model, and
so will concert and music-halls. The schoolrooms of the country and
the temples of the London School Board will all be re-construoted—
of course at the cost of the ratepayers; and taverns and eating-
houses will have to conform to the new building regulations.
Nearly all the London theatres now have their outer doors so hung
that they open outwards. This is done on the authority of the Board
of Works, and in defiance of the Common Law and several Acts of
Parliament. It is a pleasant thing for the few thousands of people
who visit theatres, but not so pleasant for tke fow millions who walk
about the streets. At any moment an unsuspecting passenger may
be swegt off the public footway. This, it appears, is not enough for
an excited British Legislature. A Bifl was nearly passed through
the House of Commons which would have extended this street-door-
out-and-out-legislation to nearly every mansion in London. Such a
proceeding was perfectly logical, but likely to have been very
troublesome. Many "at homes are far more dangerous, in case
of panic, than public performances,, but what- will those landlords
and tenants say to this who hold that " Every Englishman's house is
his castle"?'
The excited British Legislature is not excited enough to do one
thing—to repeal that portion of the 35 & 36 Viet., cap. 94. which
compels all theatres to brick up all communications with adjoining
buildings licensed as public-houses. Perhaps, the Legislature of 1872
thought that theatres would corrupt taverns, or taverns theatres,
forgetting that theatres can and do sell drink in any quantity
demanded by the public. It savours somewhat of hypocrisy to
make a fuss about an outer door opening outwards or inwards, while
solid internal brick walls are built by Act of Parliament to prevent
the panic-stricken public escaping through an adjoining pot-house.

Under the beeches:

Better by far are the visions of daytime—
Pink and white frocks in the meadow are gleaming—

Sunshine, I 'm told, is productive of freckles—
Sweet are the zephyrs, hay-scented and soothful—
Work is, of all things, so says Mr. Eccles,
Good for the youthful!

Gazing with pleasure on toilers pourageous—-
Working in Haytime!

NOT A KARA AVIS AT HENLEY.—A Water-foul.
OPERATIC NOTE.
THE greatest treat of this Operatic Season was the appearance of
Madame ABELDTA PATTI and Madame SCALCHI as Ninetta and Pippo
in La Gazzo Ladra. What a charming Opera! and how perfect
were both of these Artistes. An equal triumph. The Chorus, how-
ever, was on one occasion as flat as a pancake. The Stage Manage-
men at Covent Garden, from what we have seen of it this season, seems
to have brought ineffective arrangement to an Art. The Trial Scene
was an example in point. Such a tableau in any serious Drama, and
on any ordinary stage, would have been laughed out of Court. But
a cultivated audience, because they still cling to the illusion that the
Italian Opera is got up and performed entirely by "poor ignorant
furriners who don't know no better." and who are merelv singers
without any brains—each a kind of " Singer Machine "•—will tolerate
at the Italian Opera what they would not stand at the Lyceum,
the Haymarket, or, in fact, at any West-End Theatre.
The one mechanical effect of the Magpie upon which the latter part
of the plot of the piece—the climax, indeed—turns, was a ludicrous
failure, such as might have occurred on the first night of a Panto-
mime, when there are so many heavy mechanical effects to be
managed, that one going a bit wrong is pardonable; but here, where
it was absolutely the only one. its failure, greeted with derisive
laughter, was most reprehensible. The Magpie, worked by a very
apparent wire, should have flown up to the belfry, where immediately
afterwards Pippo finds the spoon. The poor dummy made a flutter-
ing start, was jerked up against a tree in the centre, tried back,
started again with a pluck and determination worthy of a better
mechanism, and coming once more blindly up against the tree, foil
heavily on the stage, never to rise again, and Pippo and the Magis-
trate's Clerk had to go up to the belfry and "_pretend very much,"
and find the spoon just as though the Magpie had plaved its part
preperly and given the cue correctly. The entire Opera should be re-
stage-managea. The Chorus, too, should have a thorough drilling
before the next performance, if another be given; and if it be. we
recommend everyone to see PATTI and SCALCHI in La Gazza Ladra.

What is the Next Art-icle?
WE are told that never was Art so patronised in England as it is
in the present day. So it would appear to be from the following
advertisement, which appears in the Daily Telegraph (July 3):—
TO ARTISTS.—A City Firm has an export order for 2000 Oil Paint-
ings, from 3* to £2. Artists wanting Employment can address, i-c.
Here is a brilliant opening for merry old Academicians, festive
flagstone "screevers," and "distingnishe'd amateurs."
"A GETEJLAL BOOTH "on the site of the late Grecian Theatre
sounds like a tent on debatable ground between Church and Stage.
It was the latter: -it isn't the former.

"YES, OLD CHAPPIE. COULDN'T STAND THE COUNTRY ANY LONGER. CUCKOO
GAVE ME THE HEADACHE!"
BEFORE THE FOURTEENTH.
(Fancies among the Flags.}
THET push them up with shoulders broad,
And hardened hands, the classic blouses;
They push them up, and louts applaud,
And loafers the trite task amuses.
There TOLYTE perched on cross-bars shouts
A higher bar to GCGUSSE lower;
And PEUDHOMME, gaping at them, pouts
Because the work is getting slower.
But keener eyes than PKUDHOMME'S, though
The dust of time their glass besmirches,
See May-poles into gibbets grow.
And find the flagstaffs sting like birches.
The scaffolds make one think of spars
Strewn by the winds of war pervading;
And those same recreative bars
Suggest to some some barricading.
Those self-same poles the Eagle bore,
Than which poor Poll is now supremer;
Our lycee tunics once we wore
Beneath that feebly-coloured streamer.
They flung unto the summer breeze
Crowned N.'s despite the scarlet scowler;
Those N.'s are now nonentities,
And we are men—a fate that's fouller.
And we are men, and tired beneath
The paltry poles, the tawdry towers,
"We see a handcuff in the wreath,
And immortelles seem all the flowers.
The banners wave like whips; some souls
Think R. F. silly as the lily;
And sailing life's sea 'neath bare poles,
Some find these July breezes chilly.
For we took Bastilles then at heart,
Quixotes whose castles filled three Castilles;
And now we know no human art
Can batter down the basest Bastilles;
Those Bastilles of the mind that hold
Rebellion's recollections wizened,
And white, like LINGITET, old and cold,
And a perpetuite imprisoned.
It's only waiting swords, we know,
These Gallic hands consent to twine a
Garland of olives; they 've a crow
In peace-hymns—crow of Cochin-China.
And bonnets-rouges as coiffures go,
Less chie than shako and than casque are;
And when they shout that war's a woe,
An echo answers, "Madagascar!"
A LOOK INTO LIMBO.
"THE neighbourhood," said I, "seems like one huge unwalled
lunatic asylum."
My guide smiled significantly, and pressed his finger to his invo-
luntarily curving lips. _
"Do not put it in that way, please," said he, softly. "It may
give needless offence. These poor people not so long since ruled
Society. It is their pleasing delusion that they do so still. Pray do
not disturb them in that soothing belief."
Such an odd assortment of head-gears I never saw as among these
people. Some wore huge Mob-caps many sizes too large for them,
so that they seemed like sons of Lilliput masquerading as Brobdin^-
nagian grandmothers. These assumed airs of the most autocratic
sell-assertion. Others bore Phrygian caps of varied colour and cut,
blood-red and black being the prevailing tints. These flaunted
feverishly, and attitudinised most ludicrously; some, posing in pos-
tures of statuesque calm, coldly contemplated vacuity; some striking
attitudes of Ajax-like energy, desperately defied the invisible. Yet
a third class, and these the 'most numerous, snorted Fools' caps of
every conceivable variety. Their wild, bewildering differences of port
and bearing defied classification. In one thing only were the crowds
of cap-bearers alike: they all looked fatuously sell-complacent.
"And you say that these singular creatures once ruled Society?"
said L incredulously.
"Yes," replied my interlocutor. "until the time of the 'Great
Revolt,' and of their common banishment hither."
I solicited further enlightenment.
"Those persons with Mob-caps," said my informant; "were once
known as ' Grandmotherly Legislators." Their ears, which, did their
caps permit, you would perceive to be inordinately long, were ever
open to the urgings of fanatics, the pleas of prigs, the plaints of
Puritans. They were the hope of the ignoble army of Faddists and
Crotcheteers, of all whose fancy inclined to folly, and whose temper
tended to tyranny. Perched in high places, they, like a Dionysius'
ear, listened to the multitudinous whims of fools, and, like the
hands of a Briareus, carried out the imperious behests of fanatics."
"And people put up with them?" said I.
"For some time," replied my informant, "The Faddists were
many, and even more noisy than numerous. When it comes to
voting, six who shout do more than sixty who sit silent. Hence it
was that their great hocus-pocus device of Local Option met with
such huge success—until it was understood."
"What teas Local Option? " I asked, curiously.
"A scheme for giving the six who love shouting, supreme
control over the liberty of the sixty or six hundred who dislike noise,
and so hold their tongues until, in self-defence, they are compelled
to use them."
"And those personages in Phrygian and Fools' caps?" I pursued.
"They had various names," replied my guide, "Teetotallers,
Anti-Yaccinationists, Free-Contagionists, Sabbatarians, Marriage-
Restrictionists, and a hundred others. But they were all alike, in
aim and temper. Their yearning was in most instances to narrow
the scope of individual liberty, and extend that of restriction, pro-
hibition, compulsion. In all, it was to make their own preferences
the rule for the rest of Society. Those Gentlemen in the Phrygian
caps olaimed, indeed, to be the only consistent friends of freedom.
But whether they wished to impose the yoke of the majority on the
minority, or of the minority on the majority, it was the yoke they
yearned for power to apply, and the conception of a rational liberty
was entirely Deyond their grasp."

PUNCH, OE THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

AFTER THE COBDEN CLUB DISCOURSE.
(Adaptedfrom "April U Sermon.")
"And how came they congregated here?"
"Society revolted. It began to find itself cobwebbed round with restrictions, and nullified
by negations. Wherever a man chanced to be, the probability was that some' Local Majority'
hindered him from doing what he wanted to do—say. drink a glass of ale—or compelled him
to do what he didn't want to do—say, catch Small Pox. For liberty to do ten—perfectly
innocent—thing's, he must travel into ten different counties. In Surrey, he could smoke, but
not drink; in Durham he could drink, but not smoke. In Yorkshire he could do neither .but
he might take snuff, which was strictly prohibited in Westmoreland. Nay, in Little Ped-
lington coffee was banned, in the adjoining Hookem Sniyey buttered toast was anathema,
whilst in the adjacent Hole-Cum-Corner bacon was as strictly under interdict as at Bagdad.
He therefore had to take a round of a dozen miles in order to get his breakfast. This was
soon found a bore, and people began carefully to consider the real nature and claims of
'Local Option.' Of course it was then all up with the Faddists, since it was seen that for six
people to compel five to do or refrain from doing an innocent or indifferent action, unless such
compulsion were absolutely necessary to the well-being of Society, was mischievous despotism.
It was discovered that, in a large proportion ef his actions, the individual may fairly and
uninjuriously be ruled, not by the majority, or the minority, but by his own judgment or
taste, and that intrusion on that sphere is
tyranny, whether the intruder be an indi-
vidual, or a majority of 'all the world to
one.'"
"Stranpre that people should ever have
thought otherwise f" said I.
My interlocutor smiled—a slow wise smile
of subtle significance. "People," said he,
"do not think until they are obliged to.
Hence the temporary sway of stupidity in
its active form of fanaticism and faddiness,
over stupidity in its passive form of blind
acquiescence. At last, however, the com-
plication of discomfort and disaster pro-
duced by the rule of 'King Crotchet' and
his triumphant myrmidons compelled suf-
fering Society to think."
"And the result?"
"The ' Great Revolt'—so it is known in
History—of Common Sense againt Crotohet-
dom, and the banishment of the Crotcheteers,
en masse, hither. Here they are happy in
an imaginary reductio ad abiurdum of their
several theories, without practical injury
to anyone."
"Like harmless patients in a spacious
lunatic asylum?" said I.
"Perhaps," returned my guide, smiling-
ambiguously. '' But we call it' Noddy-Cap
Country, or"the Limbo of Fads.'"
MY COUNTRY COUSIN.
WITH fair complexion, watchet eyes,
With lips as red as anv rose,
With such an air of frank surprise,
And TENNYSON'S " tip-tilted" nose;
With bird-like music in each tone,
And hair a most bewitching brown,
In short, with charms she boasts alone,
My Country Cousin comes to Town.
She likes the Season, she declares,
As I once liked it long ago.
Though she encounters endless stares
From languid loungers in the Row.
She's always fresh for ball or rout.
Though maiden Aunts severely frown;
I trow it's but to gad about—
My Country Cousin comes to Town.
She cries " Academy," 'tis mine
The task to take her; quite a brute
She thinks me, if I draw the line
At visiting the Institute
And Grosvenor on the self-same day:
And so I win the martyr's crown;
'Tis just to go on in that way,
My Country Cousin comes to Town.
She loves the ancient London sights,
The Tower, TUSSATTD'S, and Monday
"Pops,"
The theatres fill up her nights.
The mornings she will spend in shops.
We go to Greenwich where we dine,
Or I to Richmond drive her down:
For such enjoyments I opine,
My Country Cousin comes to Town.
I wait upon her night and morn.
Like some poor Bobby " on his beat;
I earn alternate praise and scorn,
I carry parcels in the street.
I know of all the ill-used men,
That I'm Why, what a charming
gown!
I 'm not so very wretched when
My Country Cousin comes to Town.

House of Commons. Monday Night, July 2.—" Sorry we didn't get

GENERAL. "If it had gone on. meant to introduce Amendment,
taking power, on deposition signed, by two of his colleagues, to seize the
Grand Old Man when he is coming down to House after dinner, carry
him off home, and put him to bed. Reckon such power judiciously
used, would shorten Session by from fortnight to three weeks, and
lengthen his life by ten years.
G. 0. M. certainly responsible for a pretty pickle to-night. Going
on swimmingly; with Corrupt Practices Bill. Clause after Clause
added. Been nine days getting seven Clauses through. At to-night's
sitting got eight Clauses. Ministerialists looking pleased. ATTORNEY-
GENERAL beginning to think he doesn't manage so badly, after all;
RANDOLPH sitting moodilypulling his moustache, inclined to be a
little short-tempered with WOLFF, as if it was his fault that business
was getting on. No one to wrangle with. Nothing to be done but
go home, and let 'em go ahead since they were in the humour.
Just about to leave when G. 0. M. appeared. RANDOLPH put
down his hat, begged WOLFF'S pardon for being snappish, and pre-
pared for larka. Found opportunity forthwith. Referred to with-
drawal of GREEN-PRICE from Radnor in order to make room for
HABUNSTON thrown out in Lancashire. Five years later, GRBEN-
PRICE made a Baronet. That's a few years ago, but no matter.
Then there was HAUCOITKT JOHNSTON retired from Scarborough.
DODSCN goes in for Commons, and H. J. goes up to the Lords.

chimes in, WARTON laughs, RANDOLPH sits down, and Grand Old Man
bounds to table like a mad bull. Hour and a half spent in rowing,
after which too late for business, and progress reported.
"Not at all," said RANDOLPH, when they complimented him on
the skill with which he got PREMIER to interrupt business. "Easiest
thing in the world. WARTON can do it. JOSEPH GILLIS rarely
known to fail."
Bttsiness done.—Eight Clauses of Corrupt Practices Bill passed.
Tuesday.—Mr. WARTON had happy thought to-day. Has had
them lately at rate of one a week. Last week varied monotony
of counting-out by getting House dismissed before five on Wednesday.
To-day, 'rgone one step further," as Sir WALTER BARTTELOT says.
House met for Morning Sitting. At ten minutes to seven progress
reported on understanding that House would meet again at nine, and
go on with Corrupt Practices Bill. If, between ten minutes to seven
and seven, House could be counted, Evening Sitting impossible,
Government arrangements upset, and everybody inconvenienced.
Member for Bridport sat through last hour of Morning Sitting in
state of subdued excitement. Hardly keep his secret, especially
from JOSEPH GILLIS. Would doubtless have^confided it to him, but
coolness which arose the other day through JOEY B. counting him out,
not yet overcome. But JOSEPH would hear of it in good time, and
his generous appreciation of a master-mind probably bring him to
apologise. WARTON, his heart warmed by triumph, would forgive,
and a friendship, sweet as that of JONATHAN and DAVID, be
resumed.
Progress reported twelve minutes to seven. Members, believing busi-
ness to be over, rush out to make the most of dinner-hour. WARTON
sits on extreme edf« of bench, eagerly watching departing throng. His
hand trembles with excitement. Spills large pinch ot snuff down

Must be proud of me."
Eutiness done.—Passed two Clauses of Corrupt Practices Bill.
Thursday.—" Toajours perdrix was bad about dinner-time," SoLicrroR-
G-ENEBAL observes; "but toujours Corrupt Practices Bill before dinner, at
dinner, and after dinner, and ditto day after day, is a little worse."
"Reminds me," says Mr. PULESTON, "of my late friend, ABTEMTJS WAED'S
experiences in personal confinement. 'The jale,' he writes, 'was an ornery
edifiss, but the table was librally surplied with bakin and cabbige. This was a
good variety, for when I didn't hanker after the bakin I could help myself to
the cabbige. Debates here liberally supplied with CALLAN and CHAELES LEWIS.
"When you don't hanker after CHABLES LEWIS, you can help yourself to CALLAN."
This not the whole of the truth. There is also JOSEPH GILLIS, who adds
variety to any feast. JOSEPH with his thumbs in the armhole of his waistcoat,
spectacles on the end of his nose, his head on one side, and his impressive " It
seems to me " is worth a journey to behold. Effect on Members generally is that
they immediately start on journey, but it is from their door outwards. On their
return, probabilities five- to one that JOEY B. is on legs again, and " It seems
to me reverberating through the House. Scored great point to-night. Objec-
tion taken to one Amendment that it was not necessary, affecting only the
scum of the population, and therefore not requiring special legislation.
."Yes, Sir ARTHTB OTWAY," says JOSEPH, in his oratorial attitude, "but I
know Cavan very well, and it seems to me that, at a general election, the scum
of the population always comes to the front."
[Committee cried, Hear, hear!" and roared with laughter, which JOSEPH
modestly appropriated as appreciation of his humour.
k uLate at night Treasury Bench threatened with thunderstroke. Mr. STANHOPE
on legs discussing Amendment. Grandiose Old
Man seated amia few Ministers present. Hav-
ing had at question time a little fling at a
vicar, and having since dined, was in good
humour; made few jokes for Sir C. DUKE and
ATTORNEY-GENERAL, and cheerful conversation
goes forward. Mr. STANHOPE stops with air of
surprise. Can it be possible that anyone would
talk whilst he was addressing the House? Will
not believe it for some minutes. Presently
evidence of senses grows too strong. Stops and
bends darkening brow upon Treasury Bench.

THE GOOD LITTLE PIG GONE WRONG.
A MONAGHAN MOBAUTY.
THERE were three little Pigs, three Hibernian Pigs,
Who came from one litter or brood;
Two were up to all manner of mischievous rigs,
But the third little piggy was good.
He was clean in his habits, and mild in his mien;
And his tail had so natty a curl,
That of all the young piggies ould Ireland had seen,
Little Ulster was reckoned the pearl.
He was mode quite a pet, and they tied up his tail
With a smart orange-coloured silk bow;
And he stuck to his stye, and his trough, and his pail.
He ramble and root? Oh dear no!
Those two other Pigs broke their bounds every day,
And foraged and rummaged all round;
But this good little Pig was contented to stay
In his own little stye safe and sound.
But alas and alas for this good little Pig,
His neat tail, and his nice little way!
In a neighbouring fieldt that was grassy and big,
He beheld his two neighbours one day.
They were routing and grubbing with vehement snou'i,
And turning up all sorts of food;
And that good little Pig he experienced doubts
As to whether he wasn't too good.
Orange ribbon was all very well in its way,
So was honest stye-keeping repute;
But then how delightful to ramble and stray!
And was not a snout made to root r
Mere wash got monotonous after a while;
What tit-bits those fellows did find!
Suppose he were just to pop over the stile,
And join in. He 'd a jolly good mind!
Then a black-a-vized bystander, watching him, said,
"Go it, Piggy! Come, don't be a fool I
For a great deal too long by the nose you 've been led,
And succumbed to tyrannical rule.
That rich field would be yours, if we all had our rights;
Like those fellows there, take my advice,
Go in for free forage and all its delights,
You will find it uncommonly nice."
Alas and alas for that good little Pig!
His proprietor's pet and his pride;
For his pink little snout, his Arcadian rig,
And his tail sweetly curled on one side,
When next that Proprietor looked at the stye,
Bad example had proved all too strong;
There were three naughty Pigs on the rummage—why?
The good little Pig had gone wrong!
THE OVER-EATING AND 'ARRY MATCH;
OR, WHAT IT IS COMING TO.
The Scene represents the interior of a well-lcnown fashionable resort
during the progress of a popular annual fete. Carriages full of
loudly and over-dressed people, opening hampers, clattering knives
and forks, munching cold chtckens and salad, and drinking
champagne-cup, are discovered jammed together fifteen deep, and
surrounded by a seething crated, rendering locomotion impossible
in every direction. In the centre, somewhere out of sight, a few
schoolboys, unnoticed by the general throng, who are indulging in
gossip, scandal, flirting, small talk, shouting, plate handing,
amidst peals of laughter, are doing their best to sustain the interest
of a good old-fashioned English game, supported by occasional
cheers from their more immediate partisans and sympathisers.

THE WARDROBE OF THE KHEDIVE.
(An Additional Chapter to "the Important Revelations.")
THE Englishman, by means of a heavy bribe, had managed to enter the bedroom of the
Viceroy of Egypt. He was accompanied by a poor Fellah, who trembled in every limb.
_ " I nave looked over the correspondence of your Master, and have obtained all I want,'
said the Frank. "and now I wish to examine the contents of this cupboard."
The poor Fellah sank upon his knees, and protested that were he to open it. his life woult
not be worth an hour's purchase. Plying him with gold and threats, the Englishman overcame
his objections. The doors were opened.
"And what is this?" asked the European, pointing to a costume consisting of an ulster-
coat, a pair of fustian breeches, and some silk stockings.
Those articles were worn by my master," tremblingly answered the Northern African
"in the British House of Commons."
"He was there!" echoed the Englishman, overcome with astonishment.
"He was," replied the Fellah, "disguised as a Parnellite. It was his object to obstruct thi
Jritish Government You remember that
he head of his house (the Padishah) is of
Hibernian extraction?"
"So I have been told," returned the En-
glishman. "And what is this costume?"
'Those feathers adorned my master when
le was in Zululand."
"Zululand! What was he doing there?"
"Woe is me!" cried the unfortunate
fellah. "I have betrayed my master! I
bought that Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL
lad discovered the presence of His Highness
in South Africa. It.is well known in Egypt
hat the Khedive was the right hand man of
CETEWAYO!"
"Indeed," murmured the Englishman.
And what is the meaning of these blue
spectacles, and suit of quaker-cut clothes?"
"Oh! those." replied the Fellah, with .a
quaint smile, are only worn by my master
»hen he is stealing books from the principal
European libraries."
'And does he descend to such paltry
pilfering?"
"Only in hours of relaxation, answered
:he Egyptian, quickly. "As a rule, His
Highness prefers large things to small. You
will see sartorial reminders of his career in
;he shapes of the umbrella he carries inva-
riably to Capel Court when he goes there
to rig the market, and the white waistcoat
le wears when he takes the chair at a meet-
ing of a Bubble Company.'
"And what are these uniforms ?" further
inquired the Englishman.
"He wore this in Afghanistan when he
was fighting the British and their carefully-
chosen Emir. This when serving in the army
of the Boers. He was merely a boy when
be opposed you in Abyssinia, and only as-
sisted the Ashantees with arms and money."
"Dear me! He seems to have been very
treacherous!"
"Seems! Why, had I time I could prove
to you that he has been at the bottom of
every intrigue directed against the main-
tenance of British prosperity. His last
effort to destroy you was to take shares in
the Channel Tunnel Company, and secretly
agitate in favour of the Air-holes of the
Underground Railway!"
"The villain!" murmured the English-
man between his clenched teeth. 'And
now I wLU ask but one more question.
Although his name is TEWFIK, I see that
everything is marked with a large B. How
is this?"
The Fellah refused to answer. He declared
that the risk of revealing the secret was
too great. At length, however, by promising
him the written protection of Mr. WILFRID
BLUNT, and offering him the title-deeds of
a large estate in Ireland, the Englishman
carried his point.
"You want to know why all his things
are marked with a big B.?" whispered the
still apprehensive Fellah, looking round tc
see that they were not overheard. "I will
tell you. Because his name is not TEWFIK!
He calls himself TEWTIK; and when away
in his native country, leaves a deputy to
play his part. But I repeat, his name is
not TEWTTK!"
"Not TEWFIK! Then what it his name?"
The Fellah looked round once more appre-
hensively, and then replied in a voice tremu-
lous with terror—
"The real name of the Khedive of Egypt
is BISMARCK!"
Five minutes later a telegram was des-
patched from Cairo to London. It was
addressed, "Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL."

STARTLING SURMISE.
IN the Upper House of Con-
vocation of Canterbury, only
a few days since—
"The Archbishop expressed his
fear that the Welsh-speaking po-
pulation in English towns slipped
through the fingers of the Clergy,
and endeavours should be made
to prevent that."
This very grave account of
the Welsh-speaking popula-
tion in English towns can
hardly fail to remind the
reader of a rather peculiar
passage relative to the Welsh
language in one of SHAI-
SPEABE s plays, the First Part
of Henry the Fourth, wherein,
Act III., Scene 1—
"GLENDOWEK speaks tome Welsh
wordt and then the Hu»ic playi.
Hotspur. Now I perceive the
devil understands Welsh."
If such is the case, there
may indeed seem to be special
reason for the Archbishop of
CAITTERBUBY'S apprehension
that the Welsh-speaking po-
pulation referred to "slipped
through the fingers of the
Clergy." Certainly, endea-
vours should be made to pre-
vent that; but that, perhaps,
may be nothing more dreadful
than their slipping into the
hands of the Dissenters.

IRVINGITES AT ST. JAMES'S HALL.
THE Irving Banquet at St. James's Hall was a remarkable sight.
As a demonstration of friendship, esteem, and respect for Mr. IRVING,
it was an unqualified success; but, as a real dinner, and not a Stage
Banquet of 'properties," it was about as unsatisfactory as such
monster feeds generally are.
On entering, we meet everybody whom we have been meeting every
day during the Season. Everybody is delighted to see everybody else.
Yet, somehow in every recognition there is an element of suppressed
Jurprise~~f sort °f raising the eyebrows, and a mute inquiry of,
Hallo, old chap! what you here ?" which, as the admission is two
guineas, does not seem a very flattering comment upon the state of
finances generally.
Where was our "ROBEBT"? The undisciplined waiters had a
rough time of it. At first, the guests being hungry and thirstv,
are irritable, and nothing can be obtained fast enough. Then the
next phase of conduct, on the part of the guests towards the
waiters, is a sort of cringing servility. Finding that angry vio-
lence has no effect beyond scaring away the ministering an^el,
and so losing the small chance that previously existed of getting
something to eat and drink, the guest begs, implores, and holds out
lavish promises of fees, to be paid after the banquet is over, if the
waiter will only fetch him something, no matter what. The knowing
hand goes so far as to give the waiter a trifle in advance,
as earnest of what is to come (but which doesn't), if he will
only see that the supply is equal to the demand throughout the
evening. Then follows the third phase when the guest, so to speak,
expands, and, becoming good-humoured and jolly, outs a friendly
joke with the waiter, and beginning to take a more roseate view of
everything,* nods and takes wine with friends at a distance, and
addresses the waiter genially as "My good fellow," or "Just ask
that gentleman, there s a good fellow! or "Get me a little more
so-and-so, there 's a good fellow!" which state of amiability,
when the speeches have commenced, is succeeded by a sudden
burst of strong adjurations to the unfortunate waiter to " Stand out
of the way there! "—" Get out! "—" Don't block the passage! "—
"Lie down! "•—'' Go away!"—" Don't make that noise!" and so forth,
until the perspiring attendants efface themselves against the walls,
and refuse to come put at anyone's bidding, until the most interesting
speech is well on in its career, when they have their revenge by
letting off soda-water bottles in various parts of the Hall.
There is a " Table of Honour" on a lofty dais: here sits the Guest
of the evening on the right of the Lord Chief Justice who looks
every inch a Coleridge, and not altogether unlike a polite version of
the Ancient Mariner in evening-dress. When the Ancient Mariner,
later on, holds the five hundred guests with his glittering eye,
and evinces a marked tendency to be prolix, the resemblance
becomes stronger than ever. Behind the Chairman (the representative
of the Ancient Mariner aforesaid), rising like a Cleopatra's needle from
among the banked-up flowers, is a column of ice, which, from pur
point of view, seems to threaten Lord COLERIDGE'S head, either with
a violent cold for the next morning, or with toppling over, crashing
down like an iceberg, and smashing him. This causes me for some
time a considerable amount of anxiety; but. finding that nothing
happens, and that I am losing my dinner by keeping my eye on the
safety of the Lord Chief, I come to the conclusion that the danger
is only imaginary, and that the ice-block has been placed behind the

. "but upon whom the soldier, who it may be presumed was a
lerly diploma'd Army-Surgeon, performed this operation, I ain
guests at the Table of Honour to cool their enthusiasm. The dinner
ended, a nourish of trumpets proclaims silence for the Chair, or rather
for the Ancient Mariner m it. The Toastmaster's voice is audible,
hnt, speaking for some of us at our table, it is not always intelligible.
He waves a baton, apparently under the harmless delusion that ne is
directing something or other, probably the cheering, but no one
pays the slightest' attention to
his movements, except when he
becomes very demonstrative,
when the Guest of the Evening
and the Ancient Mariner keep
their heads well out of the
reach of the formidable
weapon.
Lord COLERIDGE proposes
"The QUEEN!" whereupon a
comic band in the Upper Gal-
lery. — led by a really humorous
Conductor, who has hitherto
shown a strong tendency to
come over the balustrade at all
risks and join in the festivities
below,— plays a comic version
of the National Anthem with
a burlesque part for the fife or
flute, such as the fife-boy used to
play in the Army of Bombastes
Furioso. Though this perform-
ance gives universal satisfac-
tion, it is not repeated. Then,
as an appropriate musical illus-
tration to the toast of "The
Prince of WALES," MissAjrroi-
KETTE STERLDTO sings something about "Here's to the soldier that
bled

unable to ascertain.
Then the Ancient Mariner, being once more started, proposes the
health of the American President; whereupon Mr. CHARLES SANT-
LET, unable to restrain his feelings, springs on to the platform, and,
after an enthusiastic reception, sings " O Ruddier than the Cherri/."-
whether out of compliment to the American Minister (he was standing
with his back to Mr. LOWELL all the time) or as a graceful allusion to
the dessert, was not stated.
Once more the Ancient Mariner rises to give us the toast of the
evening,— which toast in the Mariner's hands is rather a dry one.
The Ancient One does not appear to be well up in his subject, and the
subject (perhaps this is owing to the Coleridge manner) seems to be
less and less congenial to him as he goes on. He tells us in effect that
a living Actor is better than a dead Dramatist; and alludes occasionally
to someone of "the name of SOPHOCLES." He is by turns flattering and
apologetic. He finishes his line of illustrious Actors at MACEEADT,
omitting all allusion to PHELPS, CHARLES KEA>', and ROBSON. In
speaking of living Actresses he forgets Mrs. KEELEY, and in the body
of the hall we rectify the omission, much to our own satisfaction.
Lord HAXDWICKE, as representing Literature, Art, and everything
else, smiles approbation throughout, but occasionally a shadow passes
over his genial countenance as he surreptitiously eyes his cigar-case,
presses it with regretful
tenderness, and then re-
turns it to his pocket with
a suppressed sigh (evident
from a distance), and once
more looks up, broad and
beaming, with the air of a
man who is thoroughly
pleased with everything
and everybody, specially
himself, and delighted to
see his friends rallying
round him on an occasion
like the present. Except
for that cigar-case, and
for the restriction on
tobacco in that assembly,
his Lordship it the hap-
piest man present, and,
with a very little press-
ing, he would soon yield
to the illusion and rise to
return thanks heartily
and gracefully for the distinguished honour done to him this
evening. But ever and anon the cloud passes over his countenance
—the cloud of unsmoked tobacco— and reminds him that he has
not had the good fortune to bo on the stage, and that at present,
and for the next quarter-of-an-hour or more ho will be under the

Professor Tyndall's Entertainment.

Vicar of Bray."
glittering eye of the Ancient Mariner in the Chair. And so the cigar-
case disappears till happier times. The Ancient is still speaking. He
gives us the usual twaddle about "purifying and exalting the Dra-
matic Art," and the audience is becoming restless under the inflic-
tion, when the Chairman commences a sentence with " When I was
a young man,"—which rouses everybody. We all anticipate a
good story, or perhaps a song, telling us "How I became a Lord
Chief Justice." But the Ancient Mariner loses his opjiortunity. The
anecdote was evidently on the very tip of the Chairman's tongue,
and Lord HABDWICKE was leaning
back in his chair, smiling' on the
audience with a sort of "I know-
what's-coming—you "11-like-it" ex-
pression, when the Chairman seemed
to catch somebody's eye, whether Sir
JAMES HAXNEN'S, who doesn't like the
sort of thing, or Sir JOSEPH CHITTY'S,
who had heard it before, and didn't
care about it, it was impossible at our
distance from his table to decide;
but, be that as it mav, the momen-
tary light fades from the Chairman's
eye, and giving up the idea of telling
that racy story, and subsiding once
more into the Ancient Mariner, he
button-holes the five hundred guests
with a firmer grip than ever. By
the time he has arrived at the finish
we are under the impression that he
had alluded to himself as a mere
amateur (whereat there was some applause), that SOPHOCLES had
something to do with America, and that at some time or other, not
mentioned in history, CICEBO had been the proprietor of the Lyceum
Theatre.
Then Mr. IBVTNG makes a modest and sensible speech, noteworthy for
being untheatrioal, and for its taking the honour paid to himself as
a tributo to the entire profession of which he says he is proud to be
selected as the representative. He speaks it trippingly and acts it to
perfection, the " business " with the Ancient Mariner being especially
good. At this point Lord HARDWICKE becomes enthusiastic, under
the impression that smoking will now begin. But his Lordship is
once more doomed to disappointment, though he revives on seeing
Mr. SIMS REEVES step up. to sing, out of compliment to the Cole-
ridgian representative of the Ancient Manner, the "Bay of
Biscay " in his best style. And though Mr. LOWELL made the best
speech we 've ever heard from him (we shan't say how many we 've

COLERIDGE in the Tichborne Trial, "Would you be surprised to

Ethel. "IT 's SUCH A SPLENDID MATCH, AUNT JANE I JUST FANCY, ALL THE
STUDDS ARE PLAYING!"
Aunt Jane. "THE STUDDS! An, YOU MEAN THE STVDESTS, I SUPPOSE—JUST
AS TOU SAY THE UNDERORADS FOR THE UNDERGRADUATES."
CONVERTED SAVAGES AT THE ALBERT HALL.
(By a Visitor from the Society Islands.)
IF ever the promoters of an English Fancy Dress Ball had a splendid chance
of dispelling the Continental idea that we Britishers take our pleasures sadly,
the Savage Club,—composed of Artists. Dramatists, Authors, Journalists,
Musicians, and Comedians of all sorts who pride themselves on keeping alive
the free-and-easy spirit of true Bohemianism,—in giving their Fete at the
Albert Hall last Wednesday, under Royal patronage, in the presence of Royalty,
for the endowment of a Scholarship in the Royal College of Music (of which
Institution we 'ye heard something before, if we remember rightly) most certainly
had that splendid chance, and having signally failed to avail themselves of it,
must reckon it as among the lost opportunities.
Never was anything more brilliantly dull, that is, up to 1'15 A.M., when there
having been nothing m the previous entertainment to warrant a hope of some-
thing lively coming later on,—that is, after supper,—a considerable number of
disappointed and wearied spctators followed the example of Royalty,—which,
specially the better half of it, must have been tremendously .bored,—and got
away from the realisation of glittering melancholy as quickly as possible.
Perhaps those who left might have been the Kill-joys and Jnciibi, and of course
it is open to those who remained late to say that the fun did not begin until after
supper. If this be so,—and no Savage I have met has protested that such was
the case,—then it was a very poor compliment to their Royal Highnesses to have
given them all the weariness, and kept for themselves all the amusement. It
would not be a very nice thing to tell their "Royal Brother" that "we had
such fun when you were gone,"—but, most undoubtedly, they did not have it
while their Royal Brother and the Princess of WALES and. all the other Royalties
were present. It seemed as if the Savages, in assuming their native costume,
had wrapped themselves in wet blankets, and put a damper on any little jet of
fun or humour that dared to flicker up in a vain attempt at enlivening the
proe««dings.
Mr. LIONEL BEOTTGH, as a comic Policeman, after a few struggles to infuse
some life into the business of the scene, gave it up in despair, and it was in
a voice broken with emotion that he gasped into a friend's ear, "My boy—I—
can't—get 'em to do anything. It's awfully slow." Ones
he braced himself up for a powerful effort: he pretended
to "run in" somebody of importance; but this spasmodic
burst of pantomimic humour met with no response. People
in fancy costume only stared, and said to one another by
way of explanation of the extraordinary proceeding,
'' That 'B BBOUGH," as if such conduct would be just what
was to be expected from a Low Comedian who didn't
know any better, and who was eminently out of plae«
on such an un-f estive and solemn occasion as a Fanoy-
Dress Ball given by the Savages.
Mr. CowEif, who had composed an admirable Barbaric
March, was almost heartbroken at the lack of spirit with
which it was performed. '' The Savages," he said, '' didn't
march up to it!" The two GBOSSMTTHS—GEORGE and
WEEDOJT—in first-rate costumes, were perpetually hiding
themselves away in corners to avoid being taken on to a
distant platform and forced to share with the gaunt Mr.
ODELL the penance of contributing towards the general
depression.
Excellent were the songs and recitations chosen; first-
rate were the individuals, such as Mr. BRANDON THOMAS,
for example, who gave them. But nothing of that sort
could succeed in that vast building. The music was heavy,
and, even when the dancing commenced, the principal
part was played by "The Waits,"—for the intervals
between the dances were so long and so dull—no set of
masquers taking advantage of the entr'acte to do any-
thing—that the time hung heavily on all except those
happily constituted persons who are never tired of sitting
and gazing on Royalty. The faet is there was no one at
the head of affairs to give it the necessary go and spirit.
It should never have hung fire for a minute. It should
have been wild, rollicking, reckless, the fun getting fast
and furious towards the small hours. But the Savagss
were as tame as Friday after a month of Sobinson
Crusoe's society, and there was no one inclined to rollick.
The Savages seemed overawed by the presence of Royalty,
and appeared anxious to show how respectable they
could be.
Everyone had looked forward to the " Buffalo Dance."
Here, at all events, they said, was a chance. For this,
many, who would have gone long before, stayed, in spite
of the Royal Party having disappeared from their box,—
in itself a bad omen for the "Buffalo Dance." At last
on came the Savages, and in came the buffaloes. It may
have amused the performers and a few intimate friends,
but it neither amused nor interested anybody else. It
was vague, pointless, and irritating1. The question was,
who were most to be pitied,—the idiotic buffalo dancers,
the unfortunate musicians who had to play the stupidly
monotonous tom-toms, or the audience that witnessed the
performance, staying on and hoping against hope that
something amusing would be done at last. But though
it began welL—anil for oae second a Savage, who might
have been Mr. JOHN D'AUBAN, did some excellent pan-
tomime, which, being lively, was instantly suppressed,—
it spon settled down again into the same hopeless weari-
ness that characterised this Fancy Dress Ball up to
1*15 A.M.. when, as the song says, "Wi-ary, so weary, of
waiting,"—which might be a chaunt for our " ROBERT,"
by the way,—I wrapped my auld cloak about me, and
hied away to a cheerful supper-party, when, being treated
much after the fashion of a drowning man by the
Humane Society, I was slapped heartily on the back,
restoratives were applied, and in a few minutes I was
able to recount how I had suffered and escaped from the
.Converted and Too Respectable Savages.
TO-NIOHT, a Great Fete, whereat Royalties take stalls,—
and actively preside at them,—for the establishment of
an English Church at Berlin. All sorts of exceptional
entertainments are to be given, and the two Archbishops
will probably play a match at Lawn-Tennis for the benefit
of the new fund. Mr. and Mrs. BEERBOHME TREE are
playing a duologue. When you are Trees, it is just as
well to make yourselves Pop'lar Trees.

BOOTHERATION.
THE recent decision in the BOOTH, Eagle, and Grecian Contract Case must have been
"caviare to the General." But whv, whenever Salvationists are brought, by their own fault
or misfortune, into Court, are they taken up tenderly," and treated with such special con-
sideration? Is noise made by Salvationists in their so-called religious meetings to be
tolerated any more than noise made by any other sect? Would a procession of Roman
Catholic Orders, with banners, music, and chanting, and all the paraphernalia of their religious
ceremonies, sanctioned by the use of centuries, and "no new thing " of the day before yester-
day, be protected by the Law? Isn't such a procession illegal? And, if so, why shouldn't
sauce for the Roman Goose be equally sauce for the Salvationist Gander? Or vice versa.
Bat why any processions? whether of Ritualists, Reformers, Salvationists, Romanists,
Bradlaughites, or Freemasons? A Procession is a nuisance at any time, and should only be
permitted, on rare and exceptional occasions. As to the noisy Religious Services which
disturb the peace and quiet of neighbourhoods on the Day of Rest, they should be all confined
within the four walls of their own Tabernacle, Camp, Church, or Conventicle, whatever it may
be, and those walls should be, bv Act of Parliament, of a sufficient thickness to prevent the
escape of all noise. And what a Benefit for the worshippers within, as all noise outside would
be excluded also.
If the maxim of "Keep yourselves to
yourselves, and don't say nothing to no-
body," were acted upon by all these so-
called, or self-styled, Religious Bodies, how
much happier we should all be. "Inquirers
after Truth" can call on them, and if they
find Truth at home (not Truth's proprietor
and representative, Sir. LABOUCHEBE, M.P.,
of course he is always very much at home
in the House), they can step inside and
remain there. Only don't let the different
parties parade the streets, and come out and
disturb good folks who, unable to forego
their absolutely necessary work even on
Sunday, are compelled to remain at home
and to find their religious service in the
practical maxim Laborare est orare: or

day of rest in the open air. away from the
Screechers, the Preachers, the Ranters, and
Canters. An Englishman's house is his
Castle,—if it is a public-house it may be his
Elephant and Castle,—and an Englishman's
House of Prayer should be as private as bis
Castle: but, even in his own house, if an
Englishman is a nuisance to his neighbour,
the "aggrieved parishioner" has his remedy.

SONG ON A SUMMER
BEVERAGE.
WHEN the Summer skies are glowing,
And the Swains the hay-crop mowing,
And the cornfields yellower growing,
Whilst young lovers whisper bosh
In the hawthorn shade together,
During warm and sultry weather,
When the bloom is on the heather,
Slake your thirst with Lemon-Squash.
Jove, of Mount Olympus Rector,
Gods' and mortals Lord Protector,
Daily draining bowls of Nectar,
Wont, at Hebe's hands, to wash
Down Ambrosia, robed with kirtle
Gilt sky-blue, in crown of myrtle
Twined with olive, fared on turtle;
Quaffed a kind of Lemon-Squash.
Fresher than the crystal fountain
Alpine Traveller, his account in,
Savs he met with up the mountain,
Where he heard the Ranz ties Vachei;
Cure for morning qualm, that crosses
Chest o'erlaid with wines and sauces,
Last night's work, to cool hot fauces
Nought will serve like Lemon-Squash.
Sometimes put a slight addition
To its simple composition,
Tending to augment fruition;
Islay, Lorne, or Farintosh.
If your whiskey be not handy,
As for Jove's own Nectar, SANDIK,
Let us mingle rum or brandy,
So make Punch of Lemon-Squash.

LAST week the usual match "Gentlemen

played at Lord's; the Gentlemen distin-
guishing themselves greatly. The force of
emulation could further go if we had a

I AIN'T bin werry well lately, praps just a leetle too much igh
living, MI as I was reckmended a change of hair for a week or two
just to inwigerate my eonstitushun, I accepted a offer for Grinnidge
where the Wite Bait Season has just about begun. Orinnidge is a
nice place, Grinnidge is wen it tayn't low water and wen there ain't
no bad smells from .the River. There's ginerally 2 or 3 smoking
steamers a rushing along to make the plaice lively, and wen the
sun's a goin for to set and is thro win quite an alo of crimson glory
on the back of the lie of Dogs, and you 've had a good dinner and a
few glasses of our '47 port, which ain't quite all gone yet, you might
amost fancy yourself in Wenice, or in any other lovely waterin
place, always exceptin Margate, which has a charm of its own for
the Citizens and the Citizenesses of our grand old City as amost
in it 11 in I; can equal.
We gits a good deal of wariety in our warious companys at Grin-
nidge, not exactly from the [ignest to the lowest, coz we never has
none of the lower orders here, a reel fish dinner wouldn't suit them
to begin with, and one of our little bills wouldn't suit them to end
with; but from the lordly four horse drag with a dook or a mark is
on the box, and a lot of swells, who not only don't care what they
pays, but who axshally seems to like it all the better the more we
charges 'em, down to the little City Club as comes down by the four-
penny steamer, and laughs and talks away all dinner time, till I
takes 'em the Bill, there a naterally a great many degrees of hungry
humanity, but, as the Poet says, "one taste of dinner makes the hole
world km;" and I 've seen a reel live Dutchess make as hearty a
dinner as if she had been nothink but the wife of a Fishmonger or a
Lorriner. whatever mysterious gentleman that m:iy be.
There s one thing as always strikes me on these intresting ocasions
and that's the wonderful stories—I think that's the genteel name for
'em—as is told by gents as is quite old enuff to know better. I heard
one on 'em only yesterday say. acshally without blushing, that he
heard Professur HUCKSI.KY say that on the coast of Norway there was
a mountain of codfish nearly 200 feet deep! I think that about as
good a staggerer as even a Waiter ever heard. Of course the first
thing that suggests itself to my perfeshnal mind is, with a mountain
of cod how about .the necessary oysters? but of course nobody
bleeved him.
By way of wariety we had quite a swell Wedding Breakfast last
week, and that's always a most intresting ewent for all on us.
There's a oertin kind of sumthink about a Wedding Breakfast
that it's werry difficult to describe. Nobody seems to be quite at
his ease. The poor bridegroom tries werry hard to look as if it was
all a mere ornary ceremony as he went through about wunce a
month, but fails miserably. The poor bride in all her magnificent
array, so unnateral at breakfast time, ginerally feels no doubt as
uncumfertable as she looks. But that wasn't the case with our
Bride, not by no means. Having reached that all serene period of
insistence when blushing is looked upon as a thing of the past, our
Bride marched her young husband about with a air of triumph
beautiful to see. The Bridesmaids giggled as usual and whispered
as usual, and the young Mashers wore such fearfully stiff collers
that they didn't dare turn their heads round for fear of cutting their
throats. And the rich old uncle who paid for the Brekfast without
a grumble, and behaved werry well to vt-^-so he must have been a
reel gentleman, for we laid it on pretty thick—proposed the elths of
the appy cupple in one of the shortest speeches as I ever heard, and
then the young husband proposed the Bridesmaids with such a
degree of unnecessary warmth, and the prettiest of th« lot blushed
and trembled so werry percepterbly, that the middling-aged Bride
gave a sort of suppressed scream and a gasp and flopped off into a
regular fainting tit Defore you could say Jack Robinson I
It must be a wery fine thing to be married to a great fortune, I
should think, I never had that good fortune myself, so I can't speak
from igsperienee, but I should think so, never the less I did not envy
that young husband his ride with his wealthy bride on his wedding
day after she'd recuvertd when going to catch the train, and I should
think from what I saw, and from wnat I heard from MAUY, that all
the honey he tasted during his long long wedding-month could have
been gathered by the laziest bee as ever improved the shining hour,
from (liu werry smallest flour as ever opened. ROBERT.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
BXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

BUFFALO DANCE OF THE ST. STEPHEN'S SAVAGES.
House of Commons, Monday Night. July 9.—Clear [enough to
foresee that when the Bishops performed their sharp littlejmaneeuvre
on Third Reading of Deceased Wife's Sister Bill they were sowing a
wind that would provide them in due time with crop of whirlwind.
Whirlwind came down to-night in person of Mr. WILLIS, Q.C., who
gave notice of Resolution for abolition of Bishops in Parliament.
Great cheering below Gangway, where business on this matter is
really meant.
Some objection taken to familiar reference in WILLIS'S Resolution,
which .runs to the effect that "The legislative power of Bishops in
the; House of Peers in Parliament is a great hindrance to their
spiritual functions, prejudicial to the commonwealth, and fit to be
taken away by BILL." AH this is true enough; but the reference to
Right Hon. Gentleman at the head of the Government seems a little
familiar. I myself, following high precedent, sometimes allude to him
as Grand Old Man, or, for brevity (which is the soul of a diary), as the
G. 0. M. But that is different from WILLIS'S reference in the House
of Commons. Quite true that a Statesman who has abolished Irish
Church is proper personage to remove Bishops from the House of
Lords. But to speak of them as being "fit to be taken away by
BILL " is low.
Conservatives got a great scare to-night. Rumoured that I'u.vi>-
LAUOH was coming down to take seat. Sir STAFFORD NOBTHCOTE
»w in this great opportunity. Some might t.hinlc that only RANDOLPH
could meet emergency like this. Would show them something.
RAKDOLPH away; coast clear and command undisputed. Fiery torch
Mnt round to Conservatives. Hint conveyed to Parnellites. Everybody
early in their plaoe, impatient at prolongation of Questions. Scouts
out in Palace Yard on look-out for BBADLAUOJT. Eyes anxiously
turning to door.
"Just the sort of man to come in at the Just moment, and spoil
everything," says H. W. SMITH.
Soon as possible, STAFFORD NOBTHCOTE got on with his Resolution.
Carried, after briei conversation, and BBADLAUOH forbidden to enter
the House.
"The poor innocents!" says Mr. LABOUCHXBE. regarding the jubi-
lant throng-of Conservatives" and Parnellites. "BRADLAtraH'» been
too much for them. Twisted them round his finger like piece of
itraw. Didn't car* to have another row with police. For a man of
his age and fighting weight, very disagreeable to be hustled down
two nights of steps on hot day in August, besides having stylogrnphic
pen broken. If he could get Conservatives to rush in and pass
Resolution he was safe, whilst might renew appearance of being
persecuted. Personally, don't care for Ilu.uu.vuiu, but he's done
this beautifully."
Business done.—Passed twenty Clauses of Corrupt Practices Bill.
Tuetday Night.—" Don't know," said Mr. BOURSE, looking across
the House at Mr. JAKES HOWARD, "that I ever saw Mr. Pickwick
in the flesh. But if HOWARD would put on spectacles, he would
come pretty near. Pickwick perhaps a little more modest in opinion
of himself; but that a mere detail.
Now he mentions it. there certainly is something Pickwickian in
posture of HOWABD. With very little dressing, and a quarter of an
hour's study, could do Pickwick to the life. At present addressing
House under difficulties. Subject, Importation of Foreign Cattle.
Time, forty minutes after midnight. House crowded, fretful, and
anxious for a Division.
"Now," says Mr. HOWABD. looking up from notes, and turning
plump figure and rosy face full upon audience—" Now, as to origin
of this disease."
House howls, groans, and tears its hair. HOWAKD surprised at this
demonstration. What can be the matter? Only eying to trace
foot-and-mouth disease from earliest development. Won't be more
than an hour. Having mildly surveyed tumultuous throng, and
dexterously availing himself of slight pause, continues—
"Now, as to the spontaneous origin of this disease."
"Spontaneous " a good word, but not soothing. House howls and
roars worse than ever. HOWABD pauses. Thinks opportunity
favourable for consulting notes, which are about two inches and a
half thick. In occasional lulls, scrupulously traces back origin of
disease, which he appears to find in Zoological Gardens. (Probably
that's what was the matter with Jumbo when he occasionally walked
through iron-bound walk of cage.) Having settled this point,
HOWABD grows retrospective.
"In June, 1875," he.says—whereat bursts forth uproar louder than
ever. When storm temporarily lulled, HOWAKD, taking stride out
on to the floor of the House, said, in insinuating tones, " In 187*—•—"
No batter result. House wouldn't have either 1875 or 1876 at any
price. HOWAB* tried back. Went on another tack.

"Then there is another fact," he was heard to say above the uproar.
"Oh! oh! oh! Yah! yah! yah! 'Vide! 'vide! 'vide!" Four hundred
Gentlemen in frantic stage of indignation. HOWARD more beaming and
benevolent than ever, though increasingly difficult to follow in his remarks.
"Looking at these things," says he, I have come to the conclusion"
"Hear! hear! hear!" House ringing with cheers.
"I have come to the conclusion—" (renewed cheers]—"that the time has
now arrived "Deafening applause, amid which HOWAED, after some
gesticulation in dumb show, resumed his seat.
Business done.—CHAPLIN'S Motion, which MUNDELLA says will practically
prohibit importation of Foreign Cattle, carried by 200 votes against 192.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Something like old times in House to-day. During
epoch of-spirited Foreign Policy jjarely.-, night passed without British Fleet
sailing for the Bosphorus, or sailing back again. Russians at the gates of
Constantinople, or report of one of the Grand Dukes being seen crossing the
Caucasus. This afternoon PREMIER described how Gallic Cock has been
crowing in Madagascar—even sticking his spurs in British Consul. Also a
Missionary been appropriated by devastating French Admiral.
"Never," says EVELYN ASHLEY, "knew war begin, or threatened in foreign
parts, but there was a Missionary in it. 'Clierche la femme,' TALLEYRAND
said, when there's a social difficulty. 'Cherche le musionnaire' when there's
a war in remote corners of the earth."
Grand Old Man, in quietest way, which evidently meant business, intimated
that explanations had been demanded in Paris, and they were expected to be
of a certain kind. No bluster or responsive wing-flapping. But House feels
the affair will be properly attended to.
Thursday.—Quite a pleasant evening spent in Committee of Supply, with
Corrupt Practices to follow. Mr. DILLWYN observing Irish Members absent,
endeavoured to get up debate on old lines. PETER informed of situation,
patriotically left dinner, and hastened to Committee. Vote going forward on
Stationary. Sir GEORGE BALFOUR makes important discovery. Stationery
Expenditure at "War Office decreased during Egyptian Campaign.
Always does," says Sir GEOROE. "When war going on no time for useless
correspondence."
Shall look into this question. What we want to do is to keep down Estimates.
War is costly. But if there are more than corresponding savings in Stationery
Department, war becomes duty of Political Economists, like myself, PETER, and
DILLWYN. Shall summon meeting in tea-room, and talk this over.
Meanwhile PETEB in pursuit of Economy, urges that private Members shall
have privilege of franking. "Members of Government, says he. "can frank
up to any amount of postage. Get their private letters franked," he added,
amid groans from WARTON, who begins to think not so bad to be a Minister.
"It would," PETEB adds; "be muen more economical and lead to large saving,
if this privilege of franking were extended to private Members."
Go entirely with PETER, more especially since Parcels Post coming in. Feel
people of Barks would take deeper interest in me as their Representative, if I
could not only frank their letters, but move about their parcels on economical
terms. Business done.—Tea. Votes in Committee of Supply. Progress with
Corrupt Practices Bill.
Friday Night.—Excitement about Sir ARTHUR HAYTER'S hat revived by
report that it was PARNELL who took it. Fresh crowds in cloak-room round
the bandbox in which the mysterious hat reposes. Various opinions among
Members. Many remember that PARNELL wore band of crape on hat. Myste-
rious hat has deep band of crape. On other hand, hat is marked with initials,
"A. M." That a poser.
EDWARD CLARKE, fresh from Old Bailey, pooh-poohs difficulty. Says if a
man once gives himself up to dissipation of exchanging his hat, initials in the
last he leaves are of no consequence.
"All very well for him to be uncrowned King of Ireland," says Sir ARTHUR
HAYTER, with some bitterness. "But he's no right to go and crown himself
with my hat."
What with worry and excitement, alternating hope and despair, Sir ARTHUR
falling away. Used to be plump, well-featured, carefully dressed, and happy.
Now clothes hang on him loosely. Cheeks sunken, eyes haggardt and developing
unaccustomed fretfulness. Pretty to see Sir CHARLES FORSTER in these circum-
stances. Follows Sir ARTHUR about at deferential distance, anxiously eyeing
him. True delicacy of soul shown in fact that he never wears his hat when he
passes him. This silent, unobtrusive sympathy only aggravates Sir ARTHUR in
present temper.
"Wants toplayBILDAD the Shuhite, orELTPHAztheOtherthingite, with me,"
he growls. "Wants us to sit down on the ground together, and mourn. But I
haven't the patience of JOB. I don't want a comforter; I want my hat."
Corrupt Practices Bill through at last. Amendments towards end swallowed
wholesale. WARTON pathetically protests against this indecent haste. "SOLI-
CITOR-GENERAL says no one opposed this suggestion," he says, speaking of one of
five hundred Amendments. Whv, /opposed it." House emphatically of
opinion that it comes to the same thins1. CROSS (who on this happy occasion
mustn't forget to call Sir RICHARD) fussing about in grandest Cross style.
Bill ordered to be reported. DODDS falls upon ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S neck, is
dragged off by SOLICITOR-GENERAL as if he were BRADLATJGH, and all go home.

"THE TITLE ROLE."
ME. IKVTSG made an excellent speech at the supper given to him
by Mr. BAXCBOFT last week. Among many sensible things said
by him on that occasion, he intimated that he would rather not
accept a title, and .prefix "Sir" to "HENRY," as long as he was
Knightly appearing Before the Public. But when he retires—a
daylong distant—surely he would then accept a title if he considered
it a compliment to his profession, and a public recognition of the
Actor's social status.
For ourselves, we should wish to see a new Order established, say
of Knights of the Round Table of Art and Literature, which should
be equivalent to a C.B., and be accompanied by a decoration. For a
Knight of the Drama a "Star" would be evidently the appropriate
insignia of the Order.
The Sisters of the Brush must not be forgotten. Mrs. BUTLEE,
Mrs. JOPLINO, and Mrs.* PZEUOINT would hold rank equal to the
"Ladies of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem," or be Baronesses,
unless their husbands were decorated, in which case they would
share with them, by Royal Licence, the honour of the title.
On the Stage the rule would be the same, when it would be an
advantage to the Actresses to retain in the playbill their married
names, instead of continuing to pass themselves off on the Public as
spinsters,—a form of deception, which, in its commencement, was
not entirely innocent. But we have latterly changed a good deal of
that for the better.
Then, again, in conferring titles would arise the question, are we
to Knight the Actor, whoever it may be, in his professional, i.e., his
assumed name, or his real name? For, contrary to the custom in
every other profession,—with which it is true, the profession of an
Art does not stand precisely on the same ground—the man who goes
o» to the Stage, no matter from what class of Society he may come,
assumes, as a rule (to which, at the present moment, we are only
acquainted with one recent exception), an alias; and this, too, in
some instances, where he has come from a theatrical stock, been
brought up to the footlights, and inherited a good theatrical name, on
which he is unwilling to trade. This last instance, however, is
intelligible. What a revelation of real names there would be, if the
Heralds' College had to go into the matter, in order to confer the
titles, unless the Crown, the Source and Fountain of Honour, decreed
that, as the compliment was intended for the profession, the pro-
fessional name should be retained and distinguished.
No Actor has ever been knighted: yet WILLIAM SHAXSPEAKE must
have had a pretty good chance of the distinction at the hands of
ELIZABETH. His Sir Andrew Aguecheek and his Sir John Falstaff
were perhaps against him.
On the whole, we fancy everyone who takes any interest in the
subject would rather see a special Order—(nothing to do with the
Theatrical " Orders "—" not admitted after Seven ")—created for the
recognition of distinguished services to Literature and Art, than to
have our few and exceptionally good dramatic Artists included in
the rather mixed assembly of East-End and West-End Knights.
An English Order of St. Cecilia could be created for the Musicians,
and the distinguished order, with collar, of " S.S. Genesias and Gela-
sinus, Comedians and Martyrs, A.D. 286 and 297," for the worthy
Actors. Mr. P. is not much of a Hagiologist, but ALBAN BUTLEB
was, to whose learned work the reader is hereby referred. Their
festival is kept on August 26th, when the Order might be insti-
tuted. There can be no objection to bringing in Saints as Patrons,
while we have a Theatre dedicated to St. James the Apostle, under
the management of Messrs. HAEE AKD KEKDAL, and a Hall of
Entertainment, .the Home of the Gallery of Illustration, dedicated
to the Patron Saint of England, Saint George, under the management
of Messrs. ALFRED REED and R. C. GEAU.*. We present these hints
to the Rouge Dragon at Heralds' College, or any other learned monster

SUNDAY AT THE SALON.
AND the last. Delicate acquaintances suggest breastplates and
scent-bottles, or, at least, getting up very early in the morning, and
paying my franc for a privileged peep from eight till ten. But as
the play " has long since ceased to be "the thing," the Pictures
have given way to the People with a democratic devotion that should
make even Birmingham's JOHN and JOSEPH put up patronising eye-
glasses at them. And the People's day is Sunday, from ten till six.
Breakfast first. The Champs Elysees on a Sunday are wofully
destitute of decent inns. The " Moulin Rouge " is no more, and the
"Ambassadeurs" bears an ill name as a breakfast-place. The
dilettanti who take a roll, some Lyons sausage, and a chopine in their
pockets, are not to be imitated. The Administration thinks it is
enough to feast the eyes, and its myrmidons vigorously discourage
peripatetic luncheons. No rows of cabs and broughams at the door,
but an unceasing queue—a tail in interminable numbers—come to see
its own illustrations by the best Artists. Not very many sterling
hall-marked working-men, perhaps; there is the Fete de Neuilly on
the same day, you see, and the grass and trees at the Buttes Chau-
mont are green, and solicit smokers in shirt-sleeves. Middle-class
artisans, shopmen and girls, tradesmen, provident fund-holders come
to save a franc, students come for fun. writers come for character,
a few painters come to feel the pulse of public opinion, and a sprink-
ling of politicians come to do the democrat. The tail winds in slowly
but surely, beset by cheap Catalogue vendors—from two to ten sous—
containing information enough to satisfy anybody save the painters
who don't happen to be named therein; and after running a blockade
of fair but irrepressible angels of charity in twelve-button gauntlets,
who want money for the Orphelinat des Arts, the Alsace-Lorraine
schools, &c., shudders at the sculpture, and rushes, panting, to the
salon earn?.
Sara must be seen first of all. The Saras—there are two of
them—have put the people's taste to a sore test. There is the rude
nude Sara of HENNER, a meagre Paris gamin, whose uniform con-
sists of a pair of drumsticks, and not a bit of historic upholstery or
scenic carpentry about him. "That Sara," the prudhommes who
know their history, say, with veiled eyes, "if it had only been a
nymph or a Venus, clothes wouldn't so much matter;" and they
pass on to that other Sara of M. WEHITZ'S, the true heroic youth in
red and gold lace, a sublimated Sandford and Tom Srown, in the
act of exclaiming, "We must not say ' Vi-te le Soi.1' for that
would be naugh-ty." This is a very popular work with the mothers,
who have all a fondness for heroic cherubim.
More patriotism in oils—not olive oil generally, nor oil upon the
waters. "FLAMENG'S " Camilte Desmoulins" draws the young patriots
and patriotesses. It is nice and rosy and touching. Camillt tells the
messenger to sit down to dinner, plays with his pink baby facinghis
pink wife, and a pink servant in grey takes away the plates. "What
a pity he's so ugly I" the Girl-critics from the Faubourg say.
"Marat" flanked by ROBESPIERRE and DANTON, by M. SOCDET, is
one of those pieces of hectic tawdry that always attract-^-as subjects,
not as works—pictures that need half a page of description in the
catalogues. Before ALF.XANDKI: BERTIN'S fine canvas, the " Funeral
of Hoche," the old soldiers take their stand for a quarter of an hour;
and you hear hoarse talk of parement, brandebourg, calotte panache;
while the young warriors study the anatomy of a Lady dressed by
Madame GODIVA, couturier•«, two frames off. The " Femtnes de Parts
demandant du Pain a Versailles" is out of date in more than one
respect, and the general apathy of the multitude abundantly proves

it. Famine and Versailles are no longer closely linked in the popular mind, and M. BROUIL-
LET'S careful work only suggests LOUISE MICHEL and the bakers' shops to the Sunday Art-
patrons—the more forcibly that he has dressed his figures like 1880, not like 1789.
A distinct current bears one towards Puvis DE CHAVANNES, and it needs a strong flood to
do it. It is composed of the little rentiers who have some ideas about Art, and whose
daughters have taken prizes for sepia—the destined Puvis Chavannists of all time. "Poor
man, and when he wakes!" "It is always something to have dreamed!" are the profound
criticisms of the holiday makers around M. DE CHAVANNES' fagged peasant asleep on a
hillock with supernaturally clean Love, Wealth, and Glory hovering about him. Another
allegory, "Judith," is popular, chiefly for the reason that the Bethulian widow wears a
Tartan costume of the latest pattern, and that a number of enthusiasts think the chief figure
is JUDIC.
GEEVEX appeals to the Sunday folk in another fashion. They don't know his name, but
gravitate instinctively towards his little bits of varnished realism. "Comma c'est fa.'" is
uttered three hundred times a day before the "Bureau de JRienfaisance"—a pigeon-hole
where meagre women wait for alms, and a vigorous harridan in a red shawl argues
with an angry clerk. It is certainly thafr^-
particulaiiy the shawl. BASTIEN Lib AGE is
one of the few modern Painters whose names
mean anything to Sunday spectators. "With
them it is Faut voir M. LEPAGE; he
painted GAMBETTA." He is worth seeing,
even this year. His " Village Lore" is a
love of a picture in townsfolks' eyes: the
exaggerated rustic is making such rurally
robust love to a stout country lass with such
an intensely bucolic eagerness to believe
everything f And if the houses and trees
in tie background look as if they were
about to fall on the lovers' heads, it would
only be what they deserve, an ancient Lady
remarks to a dilapidated husband, who has
been looking too long, under the pretence
of analysing "Voeuvre."
Andromaque is studied as a matter of
duty. The People always runs to the pic-
tures with a label on them, and is prepared
to find anything hori concourt superb. An
ingenious young haberdasher who had dis-
covered that the Ministere des Beaux Arts
out of fourteen purchases had bought
twelve nudities, even he found himself
irresistibly attracted by the acquis par
VEtat. Andromaque is strongly, almost
violently, conceived and executed, but it is
a sore puzzle to the Catalogueless. M.
RocHEGBoesE's heroine is throwing herself
on the swashbuckler who has seized her son
by ULYSSES' order. She is held back by
the Greeks, and ASTYANAX is about to be
cast from the walls. There is blood every-
where — ROCHEGBOSSE has HENBI REG-
NAULT'S insatiable thirst for gore; and the
captor of the young Trojan has the head-
piece of a Huron, not the helmet of a Greek:
but, for all that, the suspended breath of
the common spectators is enough to prove
the power of the composition. The mother
touched if the Greek didn't.
And when one comes away with Prtid-
homme and the real " Salon headache" in
the evening, it was refreshing to see the
cafes open, and to know that our virtuous
countrymen had been loafing round tavern-
doors from three to six, accumulating thirst,
and with never a wicked picture to see.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
PJTI.Y the otter day, due to the frequent andTincreasing presence
of certain " Continentalisms" in the communications addressed to
him at the Foreign Office, Earl GKAimm: had, bv means of a
Circular, to direct the attention "of ~" all "members of Her Majesty's
Diplomatic and Consular Services to the necessity for greater care as
regards the use of pure English in Official Correspondence."
A Rider to the above, further enjoining on his subordinates the
use of " plain" English, has just been issued by the noble Lord, and
at the present moment it will probably be read •with some interest.
The following are a few specimens selected for their guidance:—
throat as formerly couched.
We express no appreciation of
your annexation of this Colonial
possession.
Would you, at your conveni-
ence, kindly signalise to us your
veridical course of action?
It will be our endeavour to
oppose the suscitation of national
excitements.
The difficulty can be easily
categorised as quite unmotived.
An inoreasement of your profits
out of the Canal, and partial
arrestation of our commercial
prosperity, is what we shall not
disrecommend to you.
Our minimal assistance will be
£8,000,000 sterling at 3J per cent.
It would distress us greatly
further to ruffle our mutual ante-
cedent solidarity.
Regrettable incident.
Future rendering of same.
We should like to know what
the dickens you 're up to now?
If you don't let us know what
your little game is, and precious
quickly too,—then look out for
squalls.
You seem to think JOHN BULL
has put his spirit into his pocket!
Not yet, Mossop, I can tell you.
Confounded impudence—that's
what it is. Come now, what do
you mean by it?
Fancy we're going to lay an
embargo on our trade for ninety-
nine years, for your special bene-
fit? Why, you must be a " pack
of greenhorns!"
lou surely don't think we're
going to find that for you for
nothing?
Unless you take jolly good care
what you're about, I tell you
what it is. my boy,—we shall be
coming to blows.
Show your sense, I.then, and
apologise!

It really is impossible to read in such a hubbub. Any cause to be

Official. It will be within your Lordship's recollection that the
Court has wiped off everything, and that most probably there will be
no further business before it until after the Long Vacation.

a resting-place.

a practical joke. The poor man has been imposed upon.

thing to do! [Resumes his reading.
Enter a Plaintiff, timidly.
Plaintiff. Oh, I beg your pardon, but can anyone tell me where I
can get advice?
The Entire Bar (rising like one man). This way, please.
Judge (severely). This is most indecent! Until I know the case I
cannot say that he will be allowed Counsel. (The Entire Bar subside,
and recommence their weeping.) Now, what do you want, Sir?
Have you a Solicitor?
Plaintiff. No, my Lord, but I should like to have one,
All the Solicitors in Court (speaking as loudly as their famine-
created weakness permits them). This way, please- .
Judge (angrily). Silence! (To Plaintiff.) Now then, you Sir,
what is your case?
Plaintiff. Oh, please, my Lord, Mr. JOXES owes me £10.
Judge. Then you can get on without professional assistance.
Under Rule 432, as your claim is so small, I cannot allow costs either
for Counsel or Solicitor. (Deep wailing heard from both branches of
the Profession.) Silence! And now, where is the Defendant?
Defendant (rising from a bench at the back of the Court, where he
has been seated.) Here, my Lord, and I would observe that
Judge (interrupting). You must not waste the time of the Court,
Sir! Now then, the Plaintiff will state his case in as few words as
possible.
Plaintiff. Well, my Lord, it was just like this. You must know,
about October last
Judge (excitedly). Stop, stop! That won't do at all. Here I will
help you. Did you lend Defendant the money?
Plaintiff. Yes, my Lord, and
Judge (interposing). That will do. You mustn't say any more
under Rule 879. And now vou. Sir—do you owe the money?
Defendant. No, my Lord, I do not; for it was just "like this.
When I found that
Judge. No, no! _ Stop! I can't hear any more from you under
Rule 342, which limits the defence to a sentence of not more than
six words. (Referring to an enormous volume.) Ah, I see that by
Rule 27,431, in such a matter as this, no Witnesses are allowed.
(Closing book.) So the case is complete.
Plaintiff (urgently). But, my Lord, may I not say
Defendant (imploringly). And can't I explain that
Judge (very angrily). Be quiet both of you! According to the
Rules now in force, you have had ample opportunity of bringing the
matter fully before me! (More composedly.) What I gather is this.
That the Plaintiff says that he has lent some money to the Defendant
—an assertion which the latter denies. Thanks to the noTel pro-
cedure, you are not put to the expense of Counsel, Solicitors.
Witnesses, and Juries. (Renewed sounds of lamentation.) Silence!
(The sobs subside.) In fact, matters are simplified all round. In the
olden days I myself should have felt it my duty to have carefully
summed-up after weighing the evidence and listening to the argu-
ments. But having no Witnesses, you have no evidence,—and employ-
ing no Counsel, you have no arguments. Under these circumstances
my duty is plain. I have here in this pocket a small coin of the
Realm. I produce it. (Suits the action to the word.) I toss it into
the air-^-so. And catch it in my hand as it descends—thus! I then
decide in my mind, before looking at it, that the head shall represent
the interests of the Plaintiff, and the tail the interests of the
Defendant. And
[Scene closes in upon the Suitors anxiously awaiting the Judge's
decision.
THE BRADSHAW JUBILEE.
THE fiftieth anniversary of the publication of the first British
Railway Guide having just taken place, it has been suggested that a
Grand Procession (something after the fashion of the Lord Mayor's
Show) should be organised to proceed from one given point to another
—say from Hanwell to Colney Hatch—in honour of the interesting
occasion. Should the idea come to anything, no doubt the following
will be found to be a more or less accurate " programme of pre-
cedence" :—
Railway Managers to stop the Traffic.
Deputation of Trains that arrive before they start.
Deputation of Trains that start but never arrive.
Deputation of Trains that neither start nor arrive but only run.
Railway Passengers who have not read Bradshaw, wearing tweed
suits, and accompanied by their portmanteaus.
The Chief Official of Bethlehem Hospital.
Railway Passengers who have read Bradshaw, wearing straw in
their hair, and accompanied by their Attendants.
The Boy at Mugby Junction,
Supported bv the Young Ladies of the "Refreshment" Department.
Bradshaw's prototype—the Sphinx of Egypt.
Practical Jokers (admirers of Bradshaw) two and two.

A PUEELY TECK-NICAL MATTER.
An advertisement in the back page of a daily paper at the com-
mencement of last week, informed the public that a very interesting
ceremony was fixed to take place on the 26th of July and following
day, at the Duke of WELLINGTON'S Riding-School. The occasion
was to be the sale by auction of many remarkable things, including
"two antique sedan-chairs richly carved and gilt, formerly the pro-
perty of H. M. Queen CHABLOTTE (unless previously disposed of)"
and'" an Egyptian Cabinet inlaid with mother o' pearl." The last
item was suggestive of the military glories of an illustrious com-
mander of Volunteers who has recently been presented with a field-
officer's commission in the Regular Army, and no doubt its birthplace
was not far from Tel-el-Kebir. The advertisement concluded with the
intimation that the collection "might be viewed at the Palace bv
special orders with Catalogues (price one shilling each), to be obtained
at the Auctioneers." A visit to those persons elicited the further
facts that the Palace was Kensington, that the special orders were
easily obtained on the presentation of twelve pence, and that the
property was being sold "by command of H.R.H. the Duchess and
H.S.H. the Duke of TECK."
The Catalogue which was presented with the " special order," was
an unpretending little pamphlet. Bound in green, it bore on its cover
nothing but the words, "Kensington Palace," and the names and
business address of the "Auctioneers and Land Agents" who had
been "commanded" to dispose of the "little lot." The title-page was
more pretentious. What are technically known as "bold lines,"
were given to a "superb richly-carved Bombay Drawing-Room
Suite, an " elegant Gilt Suite in crimson satin," and some "Chip-
pendale Cabinets and Chairs." Much smaller type was devoted to
a Dining-Room Suite in leather," and "a few Oil Paintings;"
while "Ormolu Wall-Lights, Candelabra, and a variety of other
effects," was scarcely legible. No doubt, to account for the absence
of articles de toilette, &c., the collection was announced as "the
valuable surplus decorative and ornamental furniture removed from
the Palace."
The Catalogue contained over three hundred items of a miscella-
neous character. This will be easily credited when it is stated that
No. 1 consisted of "a 4ft. iron fender, brass fire-guard, and a 5ft. 6in.
britfht.steel fender, with ormolu moulding," No. 13 of "a 7ft. carved
walnut easel,.with shield and foliated scroll mount," No. J5 of "a
pair of finely-executed bronze busts of 'Her Majesty' and the late
Prince Consort' on a pair of 48-inch Scagliola pedestals," and No.
322 (to jump from the beginning of the Catalogue to the end) of " five
kitchen chairs and a beer stillion." The furniture was displayed in
the private apartments, and can be dealt with in their respective
rooms:—
Council Chamber.—Fenders and busts as above. Also "The
superb Bombay Suite." Also warlike trophy, described in italics as
"A v«ry fine specimen from Egypt." After the last two items,
"Three 7-feet-6 mahogany cornice-poles, with gilt ends and brackets
and lacquered rings," and "A japanned purdonium and scoop" are
comparatively uninteresting.
Drawing-Room.—After a couple of "Marqueterie and buhl cabi-
nets," and a "grotesquely-carved figure of Negro boy, supporting
tray for cards," conies the gem of the collection, ''The richly-framed
Louis XVI. drawing-room suite," with its "richly-figured crimson
satin damask, stuffed and spring seats." Shortly afterwards the
Catalogue describes "Three pairs of Madras curtains," a good deal
of miscellaneous china, a bust or two, "A very fine Louis XIV.
chiming bracket-clock in ebonised case." The contents of this
room concludes with " 136*. Chinese Fish ": " 137. Twenty Dessert
Plates, painted in Japanese subjects, with gill-shaped edges "; and
"138. An Antique Pistol-case, with carved top and silver entab-
lature, presentation to Prince of Wales, 1799." Altogether a curious
and interesting collection!
Ante-Room.—Another "4-foot iron-fender." Then some " what-
nots." Then a small chintz drawing-room suite, politely described
as " elegant." Then a number of small articles, inclusive of "155.
Three Jasper Vases"; and "153. The extra chintz covers to the
suite." Nothing of importance after this till a family relic, "160. A
Superb Bronze Bust, 'King Charles the First,' 30 inches high, in
armour, after VAN DYCX. Next, more ancestral presentments,
"162. An Oil Painting, three-quarters portrait, 'Sing George the
Second' in gilt frame "; and " 163. A ditto, ditto, ' The Queen.'"
The effect of these exhibits is a little spoilt by an oil painting,
described in the catalogue as "a spirited production," and called
"The Cock Fight." However, the 6 first day's sale" is brought to
a mildly waggish conclusion with "166. An Occasional Table, with
inlaid marble top and drawer, on a quaintly-carved stem and plinth."
Dining-Room and Library.—The fender, as usual. Then "A
noble chimney glass." Next a Turkey carpet. Of the remainder,
perhaps the most interesting item is, " A gaselier, with Sugg's patent
burners and reflector."
Sitting-Room.—The invariable fender, a few chairs, and " 208. A
Terrestrial Globe, on mahogany tripod stand, with magnetic compass
and green-baize cover."
Books and Engravings.—A number of family portraits, such as
"Prince George of Denmark" "Anne. Princess of Orange (1734),"
and " Sophia of Brunswick (1700)." Then some good oil paintings.
The " whole to conclude " with a family library, consisting of "the
works of Kings CHAIILES THE FIBST and JAMES THE FIRST."
And, at this point, it may be as well to stop without entering the
Hall, the Vestibule, or the Offices, although in the hitter appear a
"Set of six metal dome Dish-Covers in sizes," and "A capital
Refrigerator in japanned oak case." Considering that this is n sale
of the "surplus furniture" (family portraits and kitchen chairs !) of
one of the most deservedly popular ladies in England, the " Bonnie
Princess MART," it ii impossible t« read the Catalogue with satisfac-
tion,—no, not even when it is regarded as a stimulant to satire or
a feeding-ground for laughter!

ELECTIVE AFFINITIES.
A SKETCH IN A BALL-ROOM.
'AERY AT THE ROYAL EVENING FETE.
DEAR CHARLIE,
You must cut the "turmuts" and come up to Town, my dear boy,
London's gettin' more lummy each day; there 's sech oshuns to see anci enjoy!
And now you can mix with the toffs—reglar toppers I mean—on the cheap;—
It's a sin to go wasting your days amongst chawbacons, 'taters, and sheep.
If you'd only bin with me larst night! I was "in it," old man, and no kid,
As a chap of my form can be in it, if ready to blue arf a quid.
Twas the " Feet of the Season," and 'ARRY, I tell yer, old pal, was all there,
With a claw-'ammer coat a lar Masher, stiff collar, and 'igh-scented 'air.
You'll 'ave 'card of the Fisheries, CHARLIE, the Kensington Show. Well, larst night,
They 'd a Feet in them Gardens, old flick, as was somethink too awfully quite.
Fairy Land not a patch on it, CHAJU/LE,—Cremorne reglar out of the run,
For pootiness, Royal Princesses, swell yum-yum, and general fun.
Ten bob and snap togs took me in, and I chummed with the very eleet,
Which, for what I call " Haft'able Mix," give me this 'Aughtykultooral Feet.
'Twas the Charity lay, doncherknow, and that covers a lot, as a rule,
But the Fanciest Fair I have bin at, to this little game was a fool.
Real jam—in all senses, my boy, for the crush was a caution to snakes,—•
But the lights and the ladies—such swells!—coloured lanterns, and magical lakes!
"Jest like What ho!" a Countess remarked. Not quite fly to 'er meaning. But lor!
They 've their alang, I suppose, these Big Bobs,—jest as we say, "I '11 give yer what for!"
Lady BUFFERING—bully for her, mate!—a pootier parcel who 'd wish ?—
'Ad a Lucky Fish Pond—with no water—and charged us "a shilling a fish."
And we hangled with meat-hooks for toys, me and WALES—he's a brick—on the banks;
Till I guess both our piles of loose silver 'ad gone in " all prizes, no blanks."
Arter wich, being dry, I made straight for the booffy, and wot do yer think?
Well, I ain't took aback by a trifle, but, Scissors! it did make me blink.
When I called for a cocktail, my pippin, I
didn't percisely expeck
That the barmaid who ladled my lotion
would be—Princess MABY OF TECK!
Arf-a-crown for the tipple was stiff, but the
feeling, my boy, there's the nick!
It was wuth all the ochre, I tell yer. I
bordered another 'un, quick.
Arter that mere Chincses came cheap, though
the Marquis TSENG serving out tea
"Was as funny as figgers on tea-chests; but
then, I 'm not nuts on Bohea.
Well, I carn't tell you arf on it, CHAEIIE,
time, paper, and memory fails.
The rose-bua enclosed you will value,—'twas
bought orf the Princess of WALES;
Which, if she's not the pick of the basket,—
But there, I don't wish to intrude.—
There are some who 're such pure and high-
pitched 'uns, that even to praise 'em
seems rude.
'AHRY fancied hisself, I assure you, 'ob-
nobbing along o' sech Nobs;
As at home as a cat in a cream-shop. And
wy not? They pocket our bobs—
(Cleared me out to a tanner)—they wait on
us. finding it well wuth their while;
And there's many a barmaid in London
more 'orty and huppish in style.
So why should tee chuck on the bashful?
Sech Haffable Mixes all round
Do dollops of good, my dear boy; and they
suit me right down to the ground.
Splendid splurge, and no error, this Feet,—
couldn't do the triek better in Parry,—
And a Duchess to draw him his bitter comes
awfully yum-yum to 'AEKY.
INTERNATIONAL COURTESY.
AT Lewes Assizes the other day, before
Lord Justice BAGG ALLAY, a French governess
was charged with ransacking the boxes of
the pupils during their absence on the occa-
sion of the visit of the Princess of WALES
to Eastbourne, and stealing every article
of jewellery she could lay her hands on.
We are informed that—
"The Judge sentenced the prisoner to twelve
months' hard labour, and told her if she had
been an Englishwoman ho would probubly hare
inflicted a much more severe sentence."
It is to be hoped the French nation will
appreciate this extraordinary courtesy on
the part of the learned Judge; and we
should very much like to know what the
sentence would have been had the culprit
in question been a German, an Italian, a
Spaniard, or a Chinese.
Simple Fees for Fees Simple!
MR. PUNCH begs to give notice that, as
early as possible next Session, he will intro-
duce a Bill for the better adjustment of
the Rates by making the Landlords pay
their fair share of the Parochial Expendi-
ture, as they very largely benefit by the
Parochial Improvements. This measure,
when it reaches the House of Lords, will be
conducted, at considerable personal sacrifice,
bv the Duke of MUDFORD. The short title
of this statute will be, "The Justice to
Tenants Act."
"WELL, tastes differ as to cheese," said
Mrs. I! \.MMIMTIUM. "But. for my part. I
think there's nothing to beat one of the
small Muscatel cheeses, or a slice of Com-
monbeer."

For valleys that are Sweetness, and lakeland that is Light!
A hideous, snorting monster, with a shriek of steam for breath.
Threatened all the silent mountains and the dreamy dales with death.
Far across the flowered valleys you could hear the tearful wail
Of the Fawns of Derwentwater, and the Nymphs of Horrowdale,
Crying, "Save us from the tyrant who his iron sceptre shakes!"
So the Knight of Commons Senses saved the Ladies of the Lakes!

Of the gallant Knight who conquered this monster in the fray;
Up, Artists! from your easels, and add your meed of pruise
For the rescue of the lakes of blue, the haze of mountain greys.
A moment more and it were lost, for children yet unborn,
The golden, silent sunset, the lone and lovely morn.
Had tyranny succeeded, and flaunted signals red,
Then Cumberland were crying and Derwentwater dead.
But the valleys are rejoicing, and a shout the echoes wakes.
For the Knight of Commons Senses saved the Ladies of the Lakes!

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FBOM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, July 16.—Curious thing to
note how House of Commons guards supremacy of English lan-
guage. Since Mr. LOWE has become Lord SHERBROOKE, only one
man in House who dare quote Classics. Several try, and are received
with varying degrees of coolness by Radicals below Gangway. Sir
S. NORTHCOTE is graciously permitted to introduce tag from HORACE
or JUVENAL. No one else on the Bench dares to try. Sometimes in
set Debate, lasting for genial week or fructifying fortnight, a
Gentleman introduces few more or less familiar lines, which are
received with grudging absence of contradiction. Naturally sup-
posed that if a man has week to get up speech he may be all right in
Latin quotation. What Gentlemen below Gangway note with
withering scorn is the sort of vocal boulders over which ambitious
orator climbs before he reaches the level of quotation.
"Remember once, dear TOBT," says Lord BABBINOTOJT, "sitting
near DIZZY; just reaching point of interesting anecdote; Hon.
Gentleman on other side delivering oration; observed DIZZY'S atten-
tion distracted. 'Stop a moment, says he, 'Hon. Gentleman oppo-
site just remembered he's forgotten his latch-key. No,' he added,
after pause, 'only going to drag in that appropriate quotation from
CICERO, beginning omnibut bonts. Sure to take in House, especially
at this time of year, when Omnibus Companies declaring dividends,
and bonuses looked for.' Go on, BARBTNGTOIT."
This jealousy broko out to-night when VILLTERS STUART gave notice
of question as to termsef ConeessiontoM. BE LESSEPS. VILLIEES STUART
not been in the Church for nothing, nor has he made " Gleanings on the
Nile" without purpose, Stratford-atte-Bow used to be a place where
good French spoken. Cairo and Alexandria nowplaces where best accent
acquired. No use hiding light under bushel. Lord GHANVILLE, Sir
C. IJlLKE, and Lord EDMOND FITZMAURICE credited with best French
going. Waterford County shall show the way. So VILLIERS STUART,
clenching his fist, stiffening his back, and gazing aggressively at
Opposition Benches, begins to quote from original concession to the
Victorious LESSEPS, "Jfoos arong donnay ah noire ahmee, M. FERDI-
NAND DE LESSEPS/' &c.
Great uproar in House. Ministerialists above Gangway genially
impartial. Radicals below Gangway coldly supercilious. Conserva-
tives behind Front Bench openly sarcastic. Irish Members below
Gangway undisguisedly contemptuous. Mr. KENNY shakes his head,
JOSEPH GtLLis cheers noisily, and, on the whole, reception chilling,
and House with effusive satisfaction lapses into English language.
Business done.—Progress with Naval Estimates.
Tuesday.—Pretty to see Lord REDESDALE'B hair gradually rising
(wherever possible) as Lord SALISBURY delivered himself to-night on
Suez Canal question. All right for considerable portion. Quito
proper to oppose Government on this as on other matters. But when
Marquis went on to lay down principle that neither KHEDIVE.
LESSEPS, nor Egyptians have any right of property in Isthmus of
Suez, Lord REDESDALE first began to feel faint, then teeth chattered,
and next thing that presented itself was that gradual uplifting of
the hair that frightened Lord DENMAN.
"Good Heavens, TOBY!" the old boy said to me as I gave him an
arm out, "what are we coming to? HEALY couldn't say more than
that; PAHNEIX not a pateh on him. Begin to have dark suspicions
about SALISBURY. Excellent man. No one better for slashing at
GLADSTONE or hacking those Liberals: but when it comes to
Communistic doctrine, begin to ask myself which is the real

SALISBURY? All very well to say Isthmus is 'the water-way of
nations of the earth.' Capital phrase. But these things spread,
and those confounded Radicals sure to get hold of it. When I go
westward, along Jermyn Street, want to set into Green Park, have
to turn up Arlington Street, and so double Cape of Piccadilly. Would
be nearer to go through SALISBURY'S house. Why shouldn't I?
No. 20, Arlington Street, is the near cut of the Metropolitan rate-
payer. Question is, whv shouldn't he take it ?' Those-of-that-

a division, went off.

long time.

rained," cries Mr. HOWARD, beaming upon House the very picture of
rosy prosperity.
Ow-ard it is to think of 'OwAED and "unger," whispers Mr.
BBOADHUBST. BARCLAY groans assent to HOWARD'S dismal prepheoy.
BARCLAY much better fitted for character of ruined Agriculturist. His
gloomy conspirator-like air highly effective at present juncture.
Business done.—Clause 1, Agricultural Holdings Bifl, agreed to.
Thursday.—"I'm a modest man, TOBY," said EVELYN ASHLEY,
just now, '' but if I fancied myself at all it would be as answering
questions. All very well to talk about DLLKE. I call him dry. No
point about him. Just sets himself to answer question in briefest
form, giving much or little information according to circumstances.
HARCOURT'S better. He takes proper view of opportunity of ques-
tion hour. Excellent opening for making joke or snubbing a man,
or trotting out a little sermon. But, if I may say so, fancy there's
more point about my style. See neatness and completeness of rebuff
to Premier of Queensland. Just now Colony a little irate on account
of New Guinea business. Fine opportunity for rubbing sore spot.
So when head of Queensland Government telegraphs opinion on Suez
Canal arrangement, and question put to me in the House, instead of
simply answering, I say, 'The Premier of Queensland, with all his
virtues, does not seem to have the virtue of knowing how to wait.'
That's neatly turned, don't you think? Make 'em mad out in
Queensland, whilst causes me to shine in Parliament and keeps the
eye of the nation upon me."
This seems conclusive, but somehow not quite sure whether it's
first business of Under-Secretary to stir up bad blood in Colonies.
As Sir CHARLES FORSTER remarks, "A smart answer doesn't always
turn away wrath, whatever the proverb may say." In fact, I hear
quite other view of ASHLEY'S pet answer this afternoon. Heard him
distantly alluded to as "a priggish Under-Secretary"; also refer-
ences made to trouble bred
in GLADSTONE'S last Min-
istry owing to habit of
young men and old being
too smart at question-
time.

rounds of applause from both sides. Having fixed an eye-glass as
he had seen O'DONNELL do, brought in two tumblers of water a la
ASHMEAD-BARTLETT, and made provision for sitting on his hat when
he resumed his seat after the manner of Mr. NEWDEOATE, he said in
loud firm voice,—
"I have to inform the House that I have received a copy of a writ
of summons in action brought against me by Mr. BRADLAUQH, the
Member for Northampton, claiming an injunction."
"Fetch it up, old boss," said the SPEAKER, "and we'll have the
lot read at the Table."
Sergeant-at-Arms brought up papers, but Sir ERSKINE MAY, per-
sisting in regarding them as confidential, whispered contents in ear
of Mr. MILMAN, his colleague at the Table. House mad as the
Colony of Queensland; bellowed " Speak up!" But Sir ERSKINE not
to be moved from the path of duty. Went on whispering, and when
he had, apparently, reached the end, sat down, and House went into
Committee on the Agricultural Holdings Bill.
Friday.—Morning Sitting began at two o'clock. Concluded at
seven. Business, to further consider Agricultural Holdings Bill in
Committee. First three hours given up to miscellaneous matter—a
private Bill, a fusillade of questions, a profoundly interesting argu-
ment between HARDINGE GIFFARD and ATTORNEY-GENERAL as to
whether Sergeant-at-Arms should appear to plead in Bradlaugh
action. At nve o'clock reluctantly got to work, and disposed of few
Amendments.
A NEW KNIGHT.
THE honour of Knighthood has been conferred on Mr. EDWIN
SAUNDERS, Dentist in Ordinary to the QUEEN. If the Dentist in
Ordinary is made a Knight, what title is reserved for the Dentist
in Extra-ordinary? May he never be required! All of us know
what an ordinary toothache is, and how grateful we are to the Ordi-
nary Dentist who will remove the grinder—just as a policeman will
order off an irritating organ-grinder—without pain and trouble to
the sufferer.
At the ceremony, which was most impressive, HER MAJESTY sitting
in the ordinary dentist's mechanical chair while attendants stood
around bearing the dental implements as insignia of the Order, in a
room hung around with drawings from ARTHUR TOOTH'S Gallery,
the Knight elect, having taken the solemn oath specially composed
for the occasion, and commencing " By gum!" was presented with
a copy of BOYLE'S Court Guide, containing the Statutes of the
Order. During the proceedings the Choir, accompanied by Her
Majesty's Private Band performing on tooth-combs (lightly covered
with tissue-paper), sang the following Ode:—
Am—" British Grenadiers."
Some talk of Alexanders,
And some of Hercules,
But what to EDWIN SAUNDERS
Are all such swells as these f
For smiling Ladies have no friend
Like him to soothe their fearn,
He '11 teeth extract,
Make 'em all compact
For the British Grinning Dears!
Chorus—For smiling Ladies, &c.
After this, the Chaplain read an extract from the works of PETER
DENS as to the obligations of the new Knight, who was then invested
with the ribbon of the Order, on which was inscribed "Tirez le
premier." The Chaplain (BoYLE, Lecturer), in the course of an ex-
cellent diseourse, remarked, "Mr. SAUNDERS is a true professional
Christian. When people go to him, 'grin like a dog,' and ' show
their teeth,'—What does he do?—he returns them good for evil.
Is he not a worthy Knight?"
As Mr. EDWIN SAUNDERS, the Dentist, has been knighted, why
should not an eminently popular Actor receive the same honour < The
qualifications are the same,—they can both "draw." And which
requires the greater skill, to " draw" a house or a tooth?
"Nolo Equescopari." *
To Doctor BANKS,—
"Wilt join the ranks
Of Knights?"
From BANKS,—
"Declined with thanks."
* Translation—"I will not be made a Knight." This is Canine-ical, and
not Canonical, Latin.— Vide Toby's Lat. Die.

acently surveyed himself from t

Has happily avenged me. You have delved
A pit for your own feet. The helpless tumble
May help to humble
Yon and your shrewd doe, BUFFER!}?—Sheitan snatch him!
Who bested me at Istamboul. He's cunning1,
But the imperious FERDINAND might match him,
And as for GHANVTLLE there—not "in the running,"
As the horse-loving Islanders might say.
Well, e'en an Infidel dog must have his day!
They thought that /was out of it. Oh, rather!
Each snub-nosed son of a cremated father
Turned up that snub at me at an acuter
Angle. But, like the Pasha's slippers, I
Also " turn up" again, and by-and-by
I hope to have the Saxon as a suitor.
And to his knees in suppliant post-
Oh, how IT1 wring h

Ah! shove, pull, tug away! You can't get off.
You scoff
At me as an old '' stick-in-the-mud?" How now?
I see big beads upon the Grand Old brow,
And " Pussy" 's less inclined to purr than scratch.
You 've met your match!
The East has its resources. You smart Giaours
Who grip Time by the forelock, lose at last
The lingeringservice of the loitering hours.
You are too fast!
Meanwhile I am en Mdence again.
Gr-r-r! does it give you pam
To see your ancient friend and old ally?
Ah! why?
We used to pull together, and you 've found
To pull without me is to run aground.
Ha! ha! Your ancient partner it will gratify
To ratify
Your action—if made worth my while, of course.
If not,—well, you will find you 've no resource
But caving in. You may deride, doubt, flout me,
But you can't do without me! [Chuckles.

SUBURBAN PUZZLES. No. 1.
THE HAMPSTEAD HEATH PUZZLE. To FIND our WHERE TO RIDE SAFELY,—THE SO-CALLED "RIDE" HAVINO BEEN STREWN WITH
WHAT AMERICANS WOULD CALL "SMALL ROCKS."
A RIDICULUS MUS FROM MONTE CARLO.
THE Prince of MONACO has entered into negotiations with the
French Government for the sale of his dominions. His Highness
•wants £400,000 and a formal promise that the Blanc Concession shall
not he withdrawn until 1910. So much has already heen made public.
The following further stipulations are now published for the first
time:—
The French Government to have use of the Army (eight generals,
splendid band of thirty musicians, and five well-trained and service-
able privates), on condition that the Prince retains any fees that the
Band may receive for attending garden fetes or evening parties.
The Rates and Taxes to be collected by the French Government
on the understanding, however, that any Christmas-boxes that may
be given to the collectors to conciliate them, shall be handed over to
his Highness as his just perquisites.
The family pedigree of the GRIMALDIS to be inserted in the French
histories in use in the Government schools. The Prince to be paid a
royalty upon the sale of the text books thus amended.
The Monaco Regalia to be exhibited in every French city. Ad-
mission, a franc. Children and schools half-price. The French
Government and the Prince to share the proceeds of the show. All
expenses connected with bill-posting, advertising, and agency in
advance, to be defrayed by the French Government.
The Prince to retain the right of conferring orders of knighthood
and patents of nobility for ten years. The French Government
during that time to suspend the Legion of Honour and the new Agri-
cultural Decorations, so that the Prince's prices may not suffer from
nntradesmanlike competition.
As his Highness will become a French citizen on the completion of
the contract, some compensation should be allowed for the less of
"crowned headship," say, the free use of the Palace at Versailles,
and the right to ride as f'a feature" in the show of the Parisian Lord
Mayor when there is one.
And, lastly, although his Highness has asked only £400,000 for
this valuable property, an additional £1000 be paid ta the vendor by
the vendee an the completion of the contract just to wet the bargain.
A WIMBLEDON WAIL.

A ROYALTY ON AN EXHIBITION.—The QUEEN has given permission
to the Water Colour Institute in Piccadilly to dub itself "The
Roval." There is a Hall of Music in Holborn, called "The Royal,"
and so to prevent any confusion, the full style and title ot the
Painters' Establishment will be the Royal Piccadilly Water Works.
By which title, Mr. Punch, Honorary President of everything
generally, wishes the Institute henceforward to be known.

"NE SUTOR SUPRA
CREPIDAM."
EVERYONE will be sorry for
the position in which the Rev.
M. TFMMINS, the Rector of
West Mailing, found himself
when he was charged with
causing the death of a young
girl by administering to her a
teaspoonf ul of the oil of bitter
almonds. He was acquitted,
though it was proved that
the chemist who sold the
poison had cautioned him as
to its dangerous nature. We
have nothing to say against
the verdict, T>ut we do hope
this will be a warning to ama-
teur doctors not to meddle
with what they do not under-
stand. Let them leave the
administration of physic to
those who have made it their
profession; for a little know-
ledge of medicine is indeed a
dangerous thing. The Clergy
are, we fear, although they
mean well, great sinners in
this respect. They have a
noble errand in the world—
that of preaching the Gospel,
and this terrible case should
teach them to stick to that,
and not meddle with the Phar-
macopoeia.
ME. W. H. SMITH said last
week that "there is a good
deal of light gold about."
How does he know? We wish
we could get a lot of it. The
lighter the better for us, as
we should immediately employ
it as floating capital. Don t
want "heavy gold," and then
lose sight of it as "capital
sunk."

THE ELECTRIC KNIGHT-LIGHT.
SOCIAL DIFFICULTY IN A
POLITICAL DISCUSSION.
THERE is a deal of hesita-
tion felt just now in starting
the subject of Madagascar at
a large dinner-party during a
dead silence, as no one likes to
be the first to display his igno-
rance on three points, as to
which some objectionable per-
son, who "only asks for infor-
mation," is sure to request
that he may be at once en-
lightened. The three points
are—
1st.—The proper pronuncia-
tion of " Tamatave.
2nd.—To whom does Mada-
gascar belong?
3rd.—Why are the French
bombarding "Tamative" or
"Tamatave?"
4thly.—Where is Madagas-
car?
The funny man will, of
course, confess at once that
he knows nothing at all about
it, and immediately get credit
for being thoroughly up in the
subject, naving only alluded to
it for the sake of letting off
a pun and saying that in his
opinion the French Admiral at
Madagascar is simply "mad-
a-gascarnading."
FROM THE FISHERIES—
SUNDAY TALK. — "Open

usual arrangements, were all

approval.
VOTE FOR VIRTUE!
"No man ought to be allowed to receive one farthing for his services at an
election. Were this the rule, numbers would be ready to sacrifice their time
to the success of their political principles."— Weekly Paper.
SCENE—Committee-Room of the Popular Candidate of the Future,
discovered in consultation with his Professional Adviser.
Candidate. So my Address has been printed and published
Adviser. Gratuitously. The Editor of the local paper insisted
upon defraying all the expenses out of his own pocket.
Candidate. No doubt because he is anxious to sacrifice his wealth
to his political principles?
Adviser. Yes. To quote his own words—"All my little earnings, the
outcome of advertisements and fashionable reporting for twenty years,
shall be devoted to the advancement of international civilisation."
Candidate. Most gratifying and unusual.
Adriser. Pardon me—not unusual. We are all doing our best for
you. I myself, for instance, am usually considered by my neigh-
bours a sharp country solicitor, as fond of fees as a fly of honey, or,
to use a more appropriate simile, as a fox of chickens. And yet here
am I giving you all my time, and actually incurring expenses out of
pocket, on the express agreement that you do not pay a farthing for
anything. And why is this? Because I want you elected to Parlia-
ment in order that you may do your best to advance scientific research.
Candidate. You are interested in science?
Adviser. Not in the least, personally, but theoretically I consider
that scientific research will probably benefit the human race. Surely
that is enough. You now understand why I throw over costs?
Candidate. Most good of you.
Adviser. Not at all. I am only following the example of my
fellow-townsmen. Has not the livery-stable-keeper supplied you
gratuitously with horses and carriages, because your view of the
policy we should pursue in regard to Japan coincides with his own;
and are not the local banker, brewer, and surgeon walking about at
this very moment as sandwich-men, displaying your placards,
because they think with you on the subject of colonial expenditure?
Candidate. I cannot be sufficiently obliged.
Adviser. We don't want you to be obliged. We are helping the
Measures, Sir, not the Man. And now it is time to commence visiting
the constituents. And as we are going into the homes of several
family men, mind you don't flatter their wives or kiss their children,
else your election will most assuredly be annulled under the pro-
visions of the Corrupt Practices Act! (Scene closes in upon a tableau
of Electoral Purity triumphant, and Canvassing Vice nowhere.)
ON A RECENT MUSIC-HALL TRIAL.
Music has charms to soothe the legal Bench,
To soften rocks, and bend the knotted oak,
But mixed with dancing is a fearful crime,
A thing to drag through every stuffy Court
Where legal gentlemen expound the law—
A law as bad as any law can be-^-
And yet the waltz is danced in six-eight time—
A time that pleases much the legal ear:
And strange it is in all this land of trade—
Of trade that prides itself on being free—
The line is drawn so savagely at hops!
"NOTHING escapes the attention of my Uncle the Admiral," said
Mrs. RAMSBOTHAM. "He is always on the Khedive, as the Egyptians

Recross the sick streak in a steamer,

Good-bye to the Season,—the races.
The fun on the heath and the hill,
When somebody cares what the pace is,
And nobody asks for the bill:
The Wimbledon tennis and cricket,
The glory of RENSHAW and STUDD,
The thunder at Lord's and the wicket,
When Eton plaved Harrow in mud;
The meets in the Park, and the coaches
With steppers both showy and fast,
All fade as the autumn approaches,
And Fashion goes seaward at last!
Good-bye to the Season! the dances
Of tomahawk Savage and swell,
The sighs as the morning advances,
Divorcing the bold from the belle,
That night in July in the moontime,
With myriad lamps in the trees,
The river at Henlev in June-time,
Half love and half indolent ease,
The Maidenhead launch and the dinner,
The gold in the West turning grey,
The triumph of Saint and of sinner,
Will fade with the season away!
Good-bye to the Season! but listen.
Old Time keeps reversing his sand,
Fresh tears in loved eyelids will glisten.
And hand will keep searching for hand,
We shall come from the sea and the heather,
Refreshed and with faces burned brown,
To face life with courage together,
Or find care in charge of the town.
Though the past to the loved one and lover
Be sorrow, success, or a spell,
It has passed like a dream and is over,
Good-bye to the Season! Farewell!

As men's have grown from sudden fears."—BYKON.
Newly-arrived Yankee (sympathetically, to Sir Gorgius'spet Flunkey).
"I OCESS, TOUNO MAN, YOU'VE SEEN A DEAL OF TROUBLE!"
A HANDBOOK OF KNOWLEDGE.
No. XI.—THE DUST-CART.
Q. WHAT is a Dust-Cart?
A. A Public nuisance.
Q. But was it designed with that end in view?
A. By no means. It was designed as a nuisance-remover, and
even claims to be so. It is this which makes it perhaps the most
inadequate and exasperating of the minor appliances of civilisation.
Q. How did this state of things come about?
A. It would take long to tell in detail. But given greedy mono-
polists, inefficient and self-seeking —Local Authorities; insolent
understrappers, and a too. too patient Public, and you have the ele-
ments of this and many other miscarriages of public justice.
Q. What is the ostensible function of the Dust-Cart?
A. The removal from premises of Private Citizens of the miscella-
neous accumulations of refuse conveniently generalised as "Dust."
Q. How is this function exercised?
A. By methods ingeniously annoying and adroitly evasive.
Q. How are these carried out?
A. Through the agency of terrible myrmidons known colloquially
as " Dustmen."
Q. What are these beings?
A. Men of ill-favourea aspect, and often almost demoniac
demeanour. The gifts required in a Dustman are various; the chief
essential, however, is a hideously hoarse and stentorian voice.
Q. Why so?
A. The first—and it would sometimes seem the sole—duty of a
Dustman is to make a noise.
Q. With what object?
A. With the Dustman, as with the street-boy—" noise for noise's
sake" is probably the unconsciously guiding principle. It may be
that in an argumentative mood he would assert that he howls forth
his ear-torturing crescendos of cacophony with the view of making his
presence known—to people in the next parish. But, at heart, I am
persuaded he would resent the vulgarisation of his matchless faculty
for shindy, by " hooking it to some useful end."
Q. At least, it cannot be difficult to ascertain the whereabouts of
a Dustman?
A. On the contrary, a Dustman is as difficult to track as a cuckoo,
or a'will-o'-the-wisp. His yells make morn hideous for hours before
his bodily presence becomes visible to the expectant householder.
Q. But if you send for him?
A. He goes on shouting, and does not come.
Q. And if you are fortunate enough to arrest him in the middle of
a shout, and opposite your threshold?
A. He at once discovers that his cart is full, and that he can't take
you till next round.
Q. Why then go on shouting?
A. Presumably to keep his voice in training.
Q. But once having fairly caught your Dustman, what ensues?
A. A long negotiation between him and yourself or your repre-
sentative.
Q. Why is this necessary?
A. The Dustman is a person of polemical proclivities, and of
punctilious tastes. Many points and difficulties suggest themselves
to his discursive fancy and pessimistic bias. To remove the dust
from your bin into his cart seems a simple process—to you. His
views are entirely different. He eyes your house with critical dis-
favour, and suggests that it is " a orkurd 'ole as ever he see." The
quality ofj vour "Dust." too, meets with stern disparagement as
muck." He doubts whether he ought to touch it, but if he should
so far favour you, he presumes you '11 consider it " wuth a hextry bob
at least." Should vou not see it in the same light, his hoarse offen-
siveness will develop itself in aggravated ways. He will make
scarcely veiled observations of an extremely uncomplimentary nature
respecting "some on 'em." Should he be asked what he means,
his sardonic reply is "Oh, nothink!—same as you do, seeminly.
Nothink/or nothink 'ill satisfv even you," he supposes.
Q. And when you have finally secured his services?
A. His object" is naturally to make them as inadequate and as
vexatious as possible?
Q. How does he effect this?
A. By making as much " mess " as he can—trampling over flower-
beds and clean flags or floors wherever possible, shouting forth
unpleasant remarks not always unmixed with oaths, and winding up
probably by going off before your bin is half empty, on the plea that
his cart is full.
Q. What is the consequence of these singular arrangements?
A. That "Dust" is the incubus of the British householder, espe-
cially in the suburbs. It is an illustration of the dilemma to which
the ordinary citizen is frequently reduced by the joint action of
Authority and Monopoly.
Q. How so?
A. Authority issues an edict, Monopoly bargains with Authority
for the profit resulting from putting it into force. The Citizen s
business is to obey, and pay. He pays certainly once, probably twice
or thrice. His convenience is the last to be consulted. His only
appeal lies to Authority or Monopoly, and such appeal, always
troublesome, is generally futile, ft. E. D.
Q. But could not these evils be obviated?
A. There is perhaps only one real difficulty in the way.
Q. What is that?
A. The ease with which they could be remedied.
A SCRUMPTIOUSJ1.AILWAY CAR.
COLONEL MAPLESON'S special train of "Mann Boudoir-Cars," the
Pall Mall Gazette informs us, is to have a special Car for the DIVA
PATTI. It is fifty-five feet long, with'' a large drawing-room thirteen
and a half feet long, furnished in amaranth wood, and embossed
leather, profusely decorated, gold predominating." This isn't a
Mann Boudoir-Car; it's a Woman Boudoir-Car; a Triumphal Car,
too, with a vengeance.
Am—" The Low-Backed Car."
When last I heard of PATTI,
She was well on her way
To sine somewhere
She didn't care
As long as folks would pay.
The Queen of Song was borne
along
Without a jolting spring
And PATTI, she,
While sipping tea,
To herself was heard to sing :—
"Oh, I sit in a Boudoir-Car,
An expensive and gay Dl-va!
I lounge and I chat in
Chairs gold, blue, and satin,
In MAPLESON'S Boudoir-Car!"
It is not yet fixed when Madame PATTI is to appear at the Fisheries
in her new entertainment, entitled "The Dita and the Belle—all
in one," when she will simply appear as herself. For this unique
performance, it it whispered that Madame PATTI will receive eight
hundred pounds a show. That's what "A Mere Song" means now-

Catching Craba and Flounders in the Thames.

Catching Wails at Whippingham

Catching Soles and Skate on the (Sea) Serpentine. Catching Whiting from the Strand.
CAUGHT BY THE TIDE!
(A Story of a Coastyuardman.)
THET sing their songs and their lifeboat lays, and the gossip to guest from host
Is of wreckage wild in the Winter-time round the dangerous Cornish coast;
There are plenty of yarns of the sailor, and of fishermen out at sea,
There are tales of the lighthouse-keepers, and of women who bend the knee
When their mates are awav in the storm-time, and the cottage is left to the roar
Of the hurricane lashing the surf to foam, and screaming about the shore;
But best of all tales that ever I heard to make me think better of men
Who fling in their lives for duty—it happened—you ask me when?
On a wonderful Summer's evening, just as holiday-time began,
It had for its scene old Cornwall—its hero a Coastguardmian!
Aparty of "trippers " had ventured to visit the rocks arid caves,
Where the sea-buds find their houses, and ignorant folks their graves;
You may search for wild adventure on the sea-coast south and north,
But for beauty travel by Truro to the village of Perranporth.
It was there on this summer evening, on the beach, as the daylight died,
That a wandering, thoughtless fellow was caught at the turn of the tide;
Up came the sea and trapped him, cutting the ground from his feet;
He rushed, but he couldn t go onward—then back, there was no retreat!
Up came the sea still closer - was it death? Not a second to count—-
Then setting his teeth at the danger, to the cliffs he began to mount.
Tearing the turf and the grasses, and scaring the sea-birds' nest,
Clinging with feet and fingers, and bruising his arms and breast,
At last with a desperate struggle he lifted his life to a stone,
Where he held with a cry for a second, suspended in air, alone!
Once more death barred his passage; and his terrified face turned grey,
For the ledge of the rock he clung to was crumbling slowly away!
"Where is the man for a rescue f" so the cry of agony ran.
"I am that man, God willing!" said REGAN tHe Coastguardman!
Then followed a terrible silence, a horror that might be felt,
For the village was emptied of womenj who muttered their prayers and knelt;
They could see the eyes of the shivering man, with the agonised face turned
As stone after stone from his safety-ledge kept slowly crumbling away!
"Bring me a rope!" said REGAN,"" and bind it about my waist;
Look at that wretched fellow! In a second he '11 fall! Make haste!
Keep the cord tight in your hands, mates—there, tighter so, and stiff;
Now, wait till I give the signal! Then haul me over the cliff.
Why do you stand there staring? I '11 save him, mates, if I can;
If I die, I have done my duty! said REGAN the Coastguardman!
He swooped to his prey like an eagle, as they lowered with bated breath:
This man with his brave life given to a fellow condemned to death.
The nlenoe grew more awful, and agony paled on the lip
Of the women and men who waited—till at last with a mighty grip
The man of the Coastguard seized him, and tightened his
arms around
This prize he had risked .his life for—then searching for
safety ground
They swung from the' ledge together, for the rope was
taut and stiff,
Till it dragged the burdened hero to the arms of the
crowd on the cliff!
»###*#
There are times when the heart's too full, Sir, for even
our English cheers.
But the women thev crowded around him with kisses,
and prayers, and tears!
So tell it about from South to North, proclaim it where
you can;
Go spread it forth from Perranporth—this tale of a Coast-
guardman!
QUITE SURPRISING.
THE Times critic on Mr. IEVING as Louis the Elere.nth,
speaks of his "seemingly toothless jaws." as if he
had expected the Actor to have all his teeth taken out
in real earnest, and then adds, with all the naive and
frank admiration for his own cleverness which might be
shown by a sharp schoolboy on his seeing Mr. IRVING for
the first time in this part, and seeing how he makes up
for it—
"For by a skilful artifice in staining his front teeth, Mr.
IHVIVO produces all the effect of toothlessness."
Dear us! how wonderful! The "skilful artifice" is
"no new thing" invented and patented by Mr. IBVTNG,
as, had it been "a skilful dentifrice," it might have
been, but a very simple " dodge" familiar to all character
Actors, Amateurs, and to everyone professionally in-
terested in the practical Drama. We should say the
receipt would probably be found in Mr. DUTTON COOK'S
amusing book on the Stage, in which he treats of all such
details.
We shall expect in some future Times critique by the
same hand to read, "Miss ELLEN TERRY, as Juliet,
Ereserves seemingly the most juvenile appearance. She
as all the fresh, clear, and peach-like complexion of a
girl of sixteen, which was, if we remember, the age of
SHAKSPEARE'S heroine. I or by a skilful artifice, Miss
ELLEN TERRY colours her cheeks with a delicate pink
cosmetic applied with a prepared hare's-foot, and softens
the outline with pearl-powder delicately laid on with a
small puff, which gives all the effect of extreme juve-
nility. Similar observations may be made as to arti-
ficial whiteness of different Actresses' hands by the aid
of bismuth, a remarkable discovery made by Miss KATE
VAUOHAN; also on the "remarkable darkness of the
eyelashes by the skilful artifice of painting them with
Indian ink—an invention lately patented by Miss NELLIE
FARREN;" and our attention will be directed to "the
marvellous lustre of Miss ANYBODY ELSE'S eyes, produced
by her unique discovery of the use of belladonna."
As to the "toothlessness,"—anyone playing dilapidated
old men have used some such device ever since making-
up became an art. Who recollects Mr. ALFRED WIGAN
as the old Frenchman, Achilla JDiifard, on the first
night? Here and there a tooth in his head, that was
all; and such a yellow, parchment, snuify old skin!
"ANY ORNAMENTS FOE YOUR FIRE-STOVES?"—When
Mr. RAPHAEL TUCK, lineal descendant of the family of
which the Friar was the best-known member, is not
busied in inventing Christmas and Easter Cards, ne turns
his attention to small ornamental screens for the drawing-
room fire-place in summer time, screens which, besides
supplying an artistic want, and tilling a vacuum^ suggest
that on every familv hearth, the great scene trom the
School for Scandal is being played by dolls—a Lady
Teazle doll being, of course, concealed on the chimney-
side. Mr. RAPHAEL TUCK has sent us a sample, of which,
being really worth mentioning, we at once tuck notice.
If cold weather sets in and settles the present fate of this
invention, we advise everyone artistically and economi-
cally inclined to go in for a RAFFLE-Trcs. When we
think of those hideous and dangerous paper-shavings,
every one must acknowledge that these newly-designed
screens are a Grate Improvements

THE REAL HAUNTED HOUSE.
(Sonie distance after HOOD.)

Miserable Dweller in Urban Slum. "An! WHEN THEY'VE QUITE DONE WITH YOU, PERHAPS THEY'LL GIVE ME A LOOK IN."
A HOUSE it is—if house that may be called
Which is dismantled of all human graces—
Haunted, indeed! By what? But half enwalled
And semi-roofed it seems. Foul dirtjdisplaccs
All ancient decoration; what was paint
Is sooty slime; where paper hung, sparse patches
Of foulness cling1. His very soul goes faint
Who enters there, his sickened breath he catches
Like a choked swimmer, for the fetid air
Reeks with revoltingness, the very charnel
Is sweeter than this pestilential lair,
Whose breath were death to the ditch-loving darnel.
And over all there broods a horror drear,
As of a waste by witchcraft foul enchanted,
E'en silence whispers to the listening ear—
This house is haunted!
Haunted by no dim memories of old days,
By no romantic wraiths of dames departed.
No solemn spectres pace these dark stairways;
No ghostly legends, grim, yet human-hearted,
Cling to these tottering walls. It were some cheer
To hear the old time-honoured clank or rustle;
But nought of ghostly deigns to harbour here,
And cowls that creak, or cellar-rats that hustle
Behind the mouldering wainscot, savour not
Of old romance, but modern waste and ruin.
Thore is no poetry in floors that rot,
O'er swamps that no marsh blossom ever grew in.
Tho only spectres are the pallid swarms
In human shape that herd like clustering cattle,
Conscious, like brutes, that swinish huddling warms,
Though roof make leak and paneless casement rattle.

These throng the tottering tenement, these crowd
The rooms, the passages, the doorless entry, .
Eager for covert scant when winds are loud.
They 'd crowd, they 'd throng, though Death himself
stood sentry.
As well he may, invisible, for here
He finds lush harvest, the insatiate reaper!
Oh, for a whiff of clover, or the dear
Fresh smell of rain-wet furrows! See a creeper
From the chill street, rag-vestured, famine-worn,
Draws near his—home? Well, yes, some purse—
belonging
Perchance to Priest or Statesman—this forlorn
Starved waif hath plumped a little, sorely wronging
His stomach by that tribute to the god,
The great god Property, as careless wholly
Of poor mankind as any that did nod
L ppn Olympian amaranth and moly.
This is his " holding "; tenant he, poor wretch
Of tenement that never knows " improvement."
Hither the Law its mandate doth not stretch,
Hither, by Civilisation's mighty movement,
Driven, with myriads more, he hides and lurks,
A helpless "nuisance," shunned by the Inspector,
Ignored by Bumbles and by Boards of Works,
By all forgotten—save the rent-collector
Of Carabas or Maicworm. Rpsy-gilled
Bucolic grumbler about drains and leases!
Here leases were a joke, here drains are tilled
In such fair sort as the death-rate increases.
Improvements here? Oo to! Not worth the while
Of Property, which battens like a vulture
On garbage-heaps. Compulsion? Statesmen smile
ftow upon Trade, anon on Agriculture.
They 'ye loud and potent voices. But the mute
Furtive and impotent Slum-dwellers 'scape them.
Yet plans for men foul-herding like the brutes
Cool'reason clamours for. The heads that shape them
Will earn their owners more enduring praise
Than faction's brainless pscans loudly chaunted;
Ah! when grim Pestilence stalks forth and slays
Its myriads, men will own in dread ainaze
This House is haunted!

dans mon journal Le Times de votre franche et tr^s spirituelle petite
lettre de 22 Juillet. Sans doute, vous avez dfeja vu le numero; et si
le prominence que j'ai donne a votre contribution vous a fait sauter
de joie, ne m'envoyez pas, je vous prie, vos remerciments; car je suis
sur que vous etes, pour le moment, plein d'un vif devouement, mfime
d'un bienveillance presque irrepressible envers nioi?
Vous avez bien compris, n'est-ce pas, que si ce n'etait pas pour
1'argent que nous recevpns de temps a temps pour des petites services
de ce gens, ce serait impossible de conduire Le Times dans une
manie're respectable et digne de la haute voie occupe, comme nous
disons en Angleterre, parle "leading journal "?
C'est bien connu que 11. GLADSTONE me paye quelque chose con-
siderable. a ce moment-ei, de n'etre pas abuse tous les jours, et que
MM. les Shipowners" pendant la seance recente sur le Canal de
Suez ont eu le tres bon sens de m'envoyer. avec empressement, un " live-
pound note." Mais une finesse honorable ne vous manque pas non
plus. Vous avez la bonte, en me priant toujours d'instrcr votre
avertissement, de dire a la fin de votre charmante petite lettre, "je
suis, du reste, pr£t a payer ce que cela coutera, si vous avez la bonte'
de m'envoyer la note.
Cela est tres bon et tres pplie, mais je vous prie de ne faire ricn

ce qu'on appelle chez nous " Le Dull Season" sera arriv£; et, si vous
pouviez, mon cher Monsieur le Proprietaire, dans ces tristes jours-14
seulement envoyer moi encore des lettres, deux pu trois—naifs,

comme celui-ci qui vous mavicz fait 1'honneur de m'adresser

sur, la fortune du Times.
En attendant, votre bienvcillant reponse, j'ai 1'honneur, mon cher
Monsieur le Proprietaire, d'etre, le votre tres sincerement,
CHINERY, Redacieur en Chef.
P.S.—Je ne crois pas qu'il y a des fautes de grammaire, ni de

deux qui m'ont echappees, M. BLOWITZ, qui est toujours tris exacte,
sans doute, les corrigera en route.
"LOOK AT HOME ! "—The " German Crown Prince and Princess"
—(Five shillings the pair, the better half being worth nearly all the
money)—are going to stay at Norris Castle, the Duke of BEDFORD'S
beautiful place in the Isle of Wight, which his Grace has offered to
place at their disposal. The grounds of Norris Castle adjoin those of
Osborne. Oh, if his Grace would only put his Grace's beautiful
Garden—Covent Garden, we mean—at our disposal for a while! If
the Duke's Covent Garden grounds adjoined those of Buckingham
Palace or Marlborough House, there would soon be a drastic
remedy for the present state of Mud-Salad Market and its environs.
Are the residents in the Market, in Henrietta Street, in Southampton
Street, Wellington Street, and the tributaries East and West all
asleep, or have they "learned to love it," and become as helpless and
hopeless as Circe's enchanted swine?
OLD Indians as a rule like sticking to a red-tape policy. Odd that
they should object to a little bit of RIT-ON. The Rajah TULIP SLASO
says that " ILBERT'S Bill" is not going along Rippingly.

EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

LOOKING BEFOKE HE LEAPS.
SUEZ-CIDAL.
RECOVERY.
NTJBSEBY RHYME ADAPTED TO THE TIME.
There was a very Grand Old Man,
And he was wondrous wise;
He jumped into a quickset hedge,
Aud scratched out all his "Ayes."
But when he found his "Ayes " were gone,
With all his might and main
He jumped out of that quickset hedge,
And scratched them in again.
House of Commons, Monday Night, July 23.—Grand Old Man
comes up to-night smiling, with small geranium flower-pot in button-
hole, and pair of largest collars in stock. Been a little difficulty, he
understand^ about Suez Canal. Government made bargain with
LESSEPS which some people didn't like. "Very well, then," says
G.O.M., "we'll drop it. Know old story about boy caught creep-
ing through hedge into orchard ?' Where are you going f' shouted
irate proprietor. 'I 'm going back again,' said the boy. Well,
we '11 go back again. Last intention in the world to give offence.
Everyone shouting out for new Canal. We thought we "d get one
made. Arranged everything with LESSEPS; but if you don't like it,
for Goodness' sake don't nave it. Really no compulsion in the
matter, and no occasion for fuss."
All this he explains in speech forty minutes long. GEANVILLE,
in other House, smiled through same discourse in ten minutes. House
not nearly so delighted at its conclusion as might have been expected.
Gentlemen who have been shouting out for past fortnight, get their
own way, but refrain from unseemly indications of triumph. In fact,
begin to shake their heads and look more gloomy than ever. Not
quite sure that Government have done right. Much to be said for
project, especially if no better to be got. Clearly no better to be got,
and what does this infatuated Government mean by going and giving
up one of the most skilfully-contrived arrangements ever submitted r
More we think of it the wanner we grow. Expect there '11 be a row
in this quarter now; which makes life worth living in Parliament.
Getting a little tired, doncha know, of blowing up Government for
making Provisional Arrangement. So now going in with coat off to
cuff them for dropping it.
Found CAVENDISH JBENTINCK in brown study to-night. (Don't

full play to front locks of hair, lets go halyards of shirt front,
thrusts hands in pockets, and stares into space.
"What's the dear boy thinking about?" DILKE asked. "Or is
he sitting for his portrait? Going to be done in this style for the
fresco companion-picture to St. George in St. Stephen's Hall P"
"No; I was thinking why GLADSTONE should nave made DODSON
a Cabinet Minister."
"You needn't make yourself ill with thinking too hard," said Mr.
HENEAOE. "GLADSTONE never liked DIZZY to beat him in anything,
even in a joke. So he made DODSON Cabinet Minister because DIZZY
made you Judge-Advocate-General. That's what's called capping a
joke."
I fancy CAVENDISH didn't see it. He went off very quickly, to
make inquiries, I expect.
Easiness done.—Got through ten Clauses of Agricultural Holdings
Bill.
Tuesday.—Little row in House of Lords to-night. 'Manchester
Ship Canal Bill down for Second Reading. Lord REDESDALE doesn't
like Ship Canals.
"Never had them in my day!" he growls. "Content then with
ordinary and proper thing broad enough for canal-boats. If this
thing goes on, have England cut up into mince-meat in a few years.
Make a sort of Holland of the Island. Never be able to drive half-
a-mile without coming across ship in full sail. Have steamers
pouring black smoke into your front bedroom window, and get hit
on the head with maintop mizzen boom when you look out to see
where smoke coming from. Had enough of Ship Canals at Suez.
Have no more of them here as long as I 'm Chairman of Com-
mittees."
So puts his foot down on proposal. Warns House if they agree to
Second Reading he won't undertake to find Committee. This would
have been enough at one time; but House sadly changing. Growing
quite Radical. Dares dispute what REDESDALE says. When he got
up, in denance of Rules, to make second speech, there were cries of
"Order!" The stout Earl aghast.
"I^am," he gasped, "standing up for order."
"You d better sit down for it," Lord GHANVILLE smilingly said.
REDESDALE mechanically felt in trousers' pocket for his ruler. At-
tempted to draw it out. But Lordships only smile, and with scowl
at unoffending Clerk at table, he resumed his seat.
"Take me away, TOBY," he said a little later, in plaintive tones
that brought tears to my eyes, and nearly made me howl. "Take
me away, and if it can be conveniently done, bury me in Westminster
Abbey. The Constitution is in danger; the Throne is toppling to a
fall; the sunset of the Empire is at hand, and the House of Lords
has shouted ME down."
In the House of Commons Sir STAFKOBD NOHTHCOTE, with apologetic
manner, gives notice of a motion on Suez Canal affair. Agricultural
Holdings Bill goes forward by leaps and bounds. Even DoDSOlf
can't materially delay it. Conundrums rather gone out of fashion
since MABUM put his famous one to SPEAXEB and never received
answer. But Mr. CAINE thinks of another one.
"Why is DODSON the most attached partner in the world?"
Give it up. Always give up a Conundrum promptly.
"Because he's never far off FOGG."

AUGUST 4, 1883.]
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Business done.—Agricultural Holdings Bill passed through Com-
mittee.
Wednesday.—The Scotch Agricultural Holdings Bill in Committee.
One of those afternoons of thrilling excitement when the Scotch
Members in possession. Claymores flashing in sunless air. Dirks
produced when arguments fail. GEORGE ANDERSON, in full High-
land costume as representing a Lowland town, offers, on Clause 4,
page 2. line 3, to dance Highland fling. Mr. McLiGAjr, differing
from the LORD ADVOCATE, on meaning of words "fair and reason-
able " in Clause 5, suddenly stoops down and produces a carving-
knife out of his stocking, whilst far away floats the music of the
bagpipe, Sir ALEXANDER GORDON, it is understood, having obtained
permission from the SPEAKER to allow a Highland piper to sit on one
of the blocks of ice in the ventilating chamber. Sometimes music
sounds as if piper, who like Mr. ANDERSON simply wears kilt, were
not comfortable.
On the Conservative side Sir HERBERT MAXWELL makes many
appearances.
"Nice young man, HERBERT," says HENRY. "Remarkable
instance of the prodigality of Nature. Might have thought there
was only material in Universe for production of one Young SAMUEL-
SON, and we've got him. But there was a considerable quantity
over. 89 HERBERT MAXWELL was born, and the Conservatives
have their Young SAMUELSON to prevent us from being too much
puffed up with pride of possession.
Business dune.—Reached Clause 5, Scotch Agricultural Holdings
Bill.
Thursday Night.—" Mind you 're in the House at Question Time.
TOBY, dear boy, CEAPLLN said this morning, " I'vegotaquestionabout
Suez Canal that '11 fetch the Government. Spent all yesterday drawing
it up. Consulted GORST and other eminent legal Authorities. You '11
find they can't get over that. There '11 be some fun, I promise you."
So there was. But, as Sir CHARLES FORSTEH remarked, the laugh
was on the other leg. Others beside CHAPLIN had awkward question
about Suez Canal. There was the Diet DE WORMS and Sir HENRY
WOLFF (who alwavs run in couples now RANDOLPH'S gone), Mr.
GORST, himself, and HENRY. All questions on different points, each
knottier than the other. Seemed impossible for Government to get
out of the thicket without a scratch.
But Grand Old Man took charge of the catechism, and nothing ever
seen more delightful than his fence. Courteous almost to verge of
personal affection. Most anxious to give all information. Read the
question over with manifest interest, giving fresh grace to its periods
by his elocution. Then, turning with friendly smile upon inter-
locutor, said something varying in length from three sentences to
seven. Seemed a full answer, though a link missing somewhere.
Perhaps didn't eateh it. Would understand better when full report
of reply seen in print.
CHAPLIN not quite so radiant after answer received. A little
doubtful about precise point. Didn't somehow seem to have got such
grip on the Government as had anticipated. But wait till report
out in evening papers. After this appears CHAPLIN anxious to
change subject. Tact quite clear G. 0. M. has said nothing to com-
promise Government either to CHAPLIN or to any other of his
questioners, each one having been quite certain in advance that at
least he 'd cornered the Government.
This excellent play almost eclipsed in dealing with Sir STAF-
FORD NOHTHCOTE'S Motion. G.O.M.s fatherly interest in Sir STAFFORD
as in a little boy playing Politics; his obvious desire to look leniently
upon his effort; his hint that perhaps it had better be left alone;
and his crowning declaration that if it would please Sir STAFFORD to
go on, there was nothing in the Resolution Government could not
accept —equal to DIZZY'S best manner.
Business done.—Education Estimates discussed.
Friday.—Another day of all talk and no work. Discussion on
India closing at half-past five, DODSON emerged from FOGG with
English Agricultural Holdings Bill in hand. House indignantly
repulsed him. Then LOBD-ADVOCATE turned up with Scotch Bill,
ATTORNEY-GENERAL for Ireland being kept in reserve with Irish
Bill if that wouldn't do. House consented to look at the matter, and
was beginning to make little progress, when JOSEPH GILLIS woke up
at the sound of the Scotch accent, and talked Bill out.
At Evening Sitting, House thinly Mustered, whilst SALT Peppered
Education Department.
"APPROBATION FROM SIR HUBERT STANLEY," &c.—Mr. GLAD-
STONE last Thursday was understood to allude to the POHIE as the
"Competent Authority" in any Suez Canal question. To be thus
mentioned by Mr. GLADSTONE is indeed a good omen for the SULTAN.
Fourth Party brought him into a question, and he figured in .two or
three letters on this subject. The Irrepressible One, the "Unspeak-
able Turk," being one of those Diplomatic Orientals "qui sait
attendre" is sure to be "in it" sooner or later, as indicated in
Mr. Punch's hist week's Cartoon.
THE CORPORATION WAKING UP.
WHATEVER other effect, whether for good or for evil, Sir WILLIAM
HARCOUHT'S rash Bill for abolishing the Grand Old Corporation and
substituting for it a Brand New One, may have had, there can be
no doubt that it is waking up the City Fathers to a keener sense of
their duties and responsibilities than they have exhibited of late.
We take from the City Press, presumably their especial organ, an
account of their late proceedings, from which we select the plums,
adding a little of our own spice, and leaving the solid pudding for
stronger digestions:—
OPEN SPACES. ALEXANDRA PARK.
That other Grand Old Man, Earl SHAFTESBURY.and that hand-
some member of a handsome family Lord GEORGE HAMILTON, M.P.,
and many other less illustrious Swells, attended the Court of Common
Council to petition that they would preserve Alexandra Park as they
had preserved Epping F9rest, as an Open Space for ever.
Mr. SNOWDON, who said that he had, of course, an intimate know-
ledge of the value of some of the hilly districts in Wales—("Hear! ")
—wanted to know the price.
Mr. WILLIAMS said he didn't know it.
Mr. SNOWDON: How much have you got towards it?
Mr. WILLIAMS (emphatically): Not a penny!
Mr. BEARD: Is it mortgaged?
Mr. WILLIAMS: Yes: up to the hilt, and down to the Lake.
Mr. BEAK: How far is it from Finsbury Park, as the crow flies?
A PETITIONER: There ain't no crows there, so we don't know.
Mr. BEAK thereupon moved, that the Court adjourn until that
important evidence T)e obtained. That not being seconded, it fell
to the ground, and was carried out by the Hall-keeper and his
assistants.
Deputy SANDERS asked Lord SHAFTESBURY whether he thought
people cared about Open Spaces? To which the noble Earl replied,
with an amused smile, that he should rather think they did.
Mr. HUGHES, who .wore the blue ribbon, but not on his garter,
asked if any drinks would be sold there; to which Lord G. HAMILTON
quietly replied, "Only such as the Corporation themselves indulged
in." At which the Court laughed convulsively.
Mr. BEDFORD said the Park was surrounded with difficulties.
(A Voice. "No.' palings.'") Well, palings were difficulties if they
were too high, as he had often found in Epping Forest when it was
enclosed. But difficulties were just the thing to suit the Corpora-
tion, because they made them wake up. The first question -was, is
it worth doing? Is Alexandra worth havingP Is Alexandra
beautiful? Is Alexandra a thing of beauty and a joy for ever, like
their own artistic Griffin? (Laughter.) The next question was the
mere contemptibly commercial question, how much will it cost?
Surely this is a matter of such infinitesimal importance that he
almost blushed to mention it. (" Oh, oh.'") Who was the sordid
soul that called "Oh!" Had he no poetry in his mere commercial
nature? Did he prefer his miserable pounds and shillings, and even
pence, to the dewy grass, the songs of birds, and the breezy zephyr?
(Voice. "Fireworks ! ") He scorned to notice such prosaic interrup-
tions, but as he feared there might be among them some few who
would wish to hear something about the mere paltry question of ways
and means—(" Hear .'" from Deputy McSllNGER.)—he would con-
descend to bring himself down to their low level. The cost of the
beautiful Park that crowned our Northern suburb, as Venice crowned
the Adriatic, was, he was proud to tell them, in the classical words
of our great Poet, "nothing to nobody." (" Oh, oh!") Let him
explain his somewhat obscure meaning. ("Hear.1") They had
among their Officers one, who, having dedicated his whole life to the
mysteries of finance, had at last succeeded in discovering an enor-
mously productive Tax that nobody paid! (Great sensation.) Some
of the clearest intellects in that abode of innocence, the Corn
Exchange, had endeavoured in vain to trace it to its source, but it
had entirely eluded their grasp, and their great Magician, to whom
MASKYOURLEAN and COOKIT were but children, had watched their
fruitless efforts with a pitying smile. The farmers of America had
claimed the credit of freeing Epping Forest, and had authorised him
to state their willingness to purchase the fair Alexandra on the same
terms. (Loud Cheers.) A certain Member of Parliament, whom he
would not condescend to name, had said the tax was a fearful charge
upon the poor man's bread—(A laugh.)—but as a poor man would
have to consume seventy-five half-quartern loaves before the tax
would amount to a farthing, even if he paid it, which he did not, he
would leave such contemptible twaddle to the purlieus of the House of
Commons. In conclusion, he would say, let them soar above the
slanderous mud of Chelsea, and seek refuge in the pure air and
brilliant sunshine of Open Spaces! (Loud cheers.) He moved it be
referred to a Committee.
Mr. INICE supported the motion, and said that the Alexandra Park
would be a bulwark, and a rampart, and an outpost, and a fortifica-
tion, and a parapet, and a breastwork, and a balustrade, and a
defence (Left speaking.)

JUSTICE IN UNEASY SLIPPERS.
"Anything more undignified than the spectacle of a Judge in his official

must make the best of it. On the last occasion of our meeting you
will remember that I had myself to hear an important case from the
boot-cupboard. However, I am most anxious that the convenience
of everyone should be considered. If I might offer a suggestion—
there is still standing-room on that chest of drawers.

Registrar of the Court (occupying the mash-nand-stand). I beg your
Lordship's pardon, but I find my present resting-place very insecure.
When the Court adjourns for the day, perhaps your Lordship will
kindly order the carpenter to look to the legs of this—hem !—
structure.
Lord Penzance (courteously). Certainly. But at the same time I
would mention that personally I should prefer to put the wash-hand-
stand—so to speak—out of bounds. The official who occupied that
coign of vantage at the last sitting of the Court somehow or other
contrived to destroy the soap-dish. (With a sudden burst of anger.)
It really was very annoying!
Registrar of the Court. Please, my Lord, it wasn't me. It will be
within your Lordship's recollection that the Principal Registrar of
the Province of Canterbury^Vas occupying the wash-hand-stand at
the last meeting of the Court.
Principal Registrar of the Province of Canterbury. Certainly I
was. But I would respectfully submit to TOUT Lordship that I
could not have destroyed the soap-dish, as the crockery-ware had
been removed from the wooden frame before I took up my position.
As a matter of fact, I was myself standing in the hole usually
occupied by the basin.
Lord Penzance. Quite so. I am sure that no officer of this Court
would treat the Bench—or, to be quite accurate, as I am seated
upon it, I should say the toilette-table—with disrespect. But I
confess I teas annoyed-^-only for the moment—at what I imagined to
be the wanton destruction of the soap-dish. (Explaining to the Bar.)
You see it spoils the whole set!
Leading Q. C. (sympathetically). No doubt, my Lord; no doubt
(Referring to papers). Your Lordship will remember that judgment
was to be delivered to-day in the case that occupied our attention at
the hist sitting of the Court.
Lord Penzance. Certainly. But, before I commence the delivery
of my judgment, I should like to know if the Court's Shorthand-
writer (who, by the way, I do not see in. his customary place on the
top of the boot-cupboard) can hear me.
A Voice. Certainly, my Lord. Your Lordship speaks with such

admirable distinctness that I can catch every syllable. I would
explain that I gave up the top of the boot-cupboard to a sister of one
of the suitors.
Lord Penzance (smiling and bowing). I am not surprised at the
Shorthand-writer's act of self-sacrifice, now that its cause has been
brought thus prominently before me. (A Lady, on the top of the
boot-cupboard blushes and si';np<?rs.)."vBut can the^ Shorthand-writer
see me?
A Voice. Yes, my Lord, through" a crevice . Ji the brickwork.
Perhaps your Lordship would kindly explain to the Lady that she
need be under no compunction in
occupying my old place, as, in its
stead, I nave found a very com-
fortable seat up the chimney.
Lord Penzance (to Lady, with
a smile). You hear what he says.
(With some hesitation, but much
courtesy.) I may add, however,
that as my judgment will be very
uninteresting, and the accommoda-
tion is so extremely limited, my
dressing-room, I should say the
Court, will have to be entirely
devoted, after the adjournment for
luncheon, to the exclusive use of
the parties in the suit. (Lady gets
down from the cupboard, angrily,
and leaves the apartment in a hujf.)
This incident is very painful to me!
However, it is better as it-is! And
now I will deliver my judgment.

table until the usual time for the
midday adjournment, when the
Court is cleared for half-an-hour.

economised space. Before concluding my judgment, I should like
to hear Counsel once more upon the point to which I alluded at our
last sitting.
Leading Q. C. With your Lordship's favour (Enters into an
exhaustive argument. At its conclusion :) I trust I have made myself
clear to your Lordship, although I have not been able to address the
Bench personally. We have had ample oral evidence of your Lord-
ship's presence in Court, but have not had (since the midday adjourn-
ment) the advantage of actually seeing your Lordship. (A pause.
Then the sound of falling water. General consternation.)
Lord Penzance (putting his head out of the curtains of the shotcer-
bath). There is not the slightest occasion for alarm. Exercising my
discretion, I occupied some of the time of the Court in considering
the admirable arguments we have just heard, in a position particu-
larly favourable to calm deliberation—a position I took up when
the Court was cleared at luncheon-time. You will notice that I
have accommodated myself to circumstances, and am addressing my
audience, like SOCBATES, from my bath! I am still a little unsettled
on one point, so I will retire a few minutes longer, to turn it quietly
over in my own mind. (Disappears. Sounds of falling water
renewed. When they have subsided, his Lordship puts out his head,
and continues:) Resorting to my old habit when practising at the
Bar, I have just taken a " refresher." (Much laughter, during which
his Lordship shakes the water from his wig, and resumes his wonted
gravity.) And now I am quite decided, and have no doubt that

AT TOOLE'S Theatre, T. W.
ROBERTSON the Younger has
reproduced M.P., considered
at the time of its first appear-
ance, thirteen years ago, at the
Prince of Wales's Theatre, one
of the least satisfactory of the
"Cup and Saucer Successes"
associated with the name of
his late father. And yet the
piece, in spite of its old-
fashioned hits at not very
modern election bribery, and
certainly very ancient bur-
lesque, has its merits. It is
brightly written, and capitally
played by at least two mem-
bers of the new Company—
Miss GERARD and Mr. G. D.
WARD, who are Metropolitan
additions to a troupe chiefly
taken from the Provinces.
Altogether, it does not require
a wizard to prophesy that
TOOLE'S Theatre, with M.P.,
will not be " M.T."
Yet another restoration. The

A COMIC COMPLAINT.
(Which, but for its subject, might be a Chapter of Happy Thoughts.)
I WILL never again speak disrespectfully of the Colic. Somehow
I had come to consider it as a comic complaint, as something which
had come to be designated by the Clown at Christmas,—if I remember
rightly as to when and from whom I first heard the expression,—as
the "Collywobbles." I could almost swear that if not in a Pantomime
it was at all events a Clown in a Circus, a "Shakspearian Clown,"
too, to whom, as a boy, I looked up with a sort of reverence; I say,
emphatically; "a sort of," because I cannot now arrive at what sort
of reverence it was. But, anyhow, he was Shakspearian. and I was a
good deal brought upon SHAKSPEARE in my earliest youth, beginning
with a light diet of Lamb's tales,"—which, I am bound to say, stood
me in good stead for many years, established me above my fellows as
an authority on SHAXSPEARE, whose plays I don't suppose I really
tackled—" tackled " is the word,—until long after I had left school.
But the less I knew about SHAKSPEARE, except being taken to see
him as a treat at Drury Lane or elsewhere, when his matchless works
were associated in my mind with Christmas time, tips, an oyster supper,
—in a real late supper place in the Strand, divided into small compart-
ments like stalls in a stable, with the luxury of drinking beer out
of a pewter pot, and a general feeling that at fourteen years of age I
was quite the man about town—I say, with the exception of these
rare opportunities of making acquaintance with SHAKSPEARE, I had
little taste or opportunity for the private study of his works, and so.
as I commenced t>y remarking when I interrupted myself, the less I
knew about SHAXSPEABE, the greater was the mysterious veneration
with which I came to regard his name and anything or anybody who
was Shakspearian,—ana when I say "anybody" I mean distinctly
one person, to whom I have already alluded, who was always known
as "The Great Shakspearian Clown," and who was invariably attached
—I have never been able to ascertain the mysterious connection—to a
Circus. I have been a pretty regular Theatre and Circus-goer in my
time, but I never remember having seen a Shakspearian Clown, as
such, taking the part of an ordinary Clown in a Pantomime, even
when that Clown preserved the traditions of his order, and had not
compromised his dignity by descending to tumbling and acrobatism.
[Note.—I cannot help pausing, as I write the word " acrobatism"
for the first time. I fancy it ought to be "acrobancy,"—like necro-
mancy, only, on the other hand, a professor of the latter art is not
called a " Necromat"—so we '11 leave it at "acrobatism," which is a
good word, and proceed with the subject in hand.]
With this youthful reverence for SHAKSPEARE,—"reverence to
authority" was early instilled into me as a principle, and SHAK-
SPEARE was always being brought forward as "an authority," so hence
logically my reverence,—no wonder that anything that fell from the
lips of a Shakspearian Clown, praised as such by my elders, who pointed
him out to me immediately on his appearance in the King, and said
"There he is!" with as much earnestness and pride (as having a
share in him at so much a head paid for our seats) as if he had been
the late Lord BEACONSFIELD or the present PREMIER, should retain a
firm hold upon my memory. I am sure that that Shakspearian Clown
on more than one occasion inquired most anxiously after the health
of the Master of the Ring, a magnificent person in a fancy uniform
of uncertain nationality, which would have been decidedly military
had it not been equally naval, and would, therefore, have been
(when I come to think of its gold epaulettes, gold braid, blue
trousers with gold stripes, patent leather boots, and spurs) the very
uniform for a General of the Horse-Marine Force, had such a branch
of the sen-ice ever been called into existence by the necessities of
some extraordinary campaign.

since, and never will be, for I speak of the past glories of "ASHLEY'S," and of
the immortal WIDDICOMB, who disappeared many many years ago, and who, I
am convinced, as I never saw any record of his death and burial, nor have ever
met anyone who had, is even now, at this present moment, existing somewhere,
like the old Dutch Navigators in the Harz Mountains,like the O'DoNOOHUE on his
white horse under the lake, like the Cid in the Spanish mountains, and is ready
dressed as of yore, epaulettes bright, heavy moustache black as jet, hair
luxuriant and glossy, splendid complexion, piercing' eyes, with spotless white
kid gloves, carrying a long flexible four-in-hand whip, waiting for the resusci-
tation of the Ancient ASTLEY'S, and only occasionally revealing himself and
his '' scenes in a—ghostly of course—circle" to some be-mused Cockney Hip Van
Winkle, who may have taken too much at the "Mother Redcap," and lost
himself on Primrose Hill.
The Shakspearian Clown was invariably deeply concerned for Mr. WIDDI-
COMB'S—I, as a boy, always thought he was either Admiral or General WIDDI-
COMB—health. It was on one of these occasions, when my young mind was
so fresh to receive impressions, that the Shakspearian Jester wanted to know
how Mr. WIDDICOITB was, and when that Gentleman, who, though always
politelv addressing the fool as "Sir," seldom answered his questions directly,
replied by asking "Why so, Sir?" the Shakspearian Clown at once explained
that his anxiety as to the state of Mr. WIDDICOJIB'S health arose from his
"having heard that he had been laid up with the collywobbles in his pande-
noodles "—whereat the audience, myself included, laughed prodigiously.
I remember that Mr. WIDDICOMB did not seem best pleased with the Shaks-
pearian Clown's facetiousness on this occasion, and even emphasised his dis-
pleasure with a smart crack of the lash, which made the Jester hop and cry,
'Oh! please don't, Sir,"—whereat, being quite sure that our favourite Clown
was only pretending, and wasn't in reality hurt the least bit, we all laughed
again; and more heartily than before, as we felt somehow that our laughter at
the previous allusion to the mysterious complaint from which it had been given
out that Admiral or General WIDDICOMB had been suffering had been a little
ill-timed, and had been, in fact, an ebullition of risibility not in anyway to
be proud of as a specimen of our sympathy or of our good-breeding.
What part of Mr. WIDDICOMB'S anatomy, or of anyone s anatomy,—
though he being such a remarkable man it might
have been something special in Ai'm,—the "pande-
noodles" were, where the "Collywobbles" had given
him so much internal trouble, no one has ever been able
to afford me the slightest information. But as to the
"Collywobbles " there has never been any doubt in the
mind of any schoolboy. Now, no one that I ever met
ever spoke seriously as from their own painful experi-
ence in my hearing of " the Colic," but, on the contrary,
classed it under the head of "Collywobbles " generally,
so that I came to consider " Colic" as a specific form of
the generic "Collywobbles": "Colic" being evidently
singular, and " Collywobbles," a collection of wobbles.
This view was borne out by two things: first, a con-
founded song—I can't help being annoyed with it. having
been deceived by it all my life up to now,—of a baccha-
nalian character, commencing—
Punch cures the gout,
The " Colic," and the " ptisic."
But what'' ptisic" is, or whether I have even correctly
remembered its orthography, I don't know, and most
medical men whom I have consulted have given it as their
opinion that the "ptisic" was an effort of the Poet's
imagination in order to end the line with a word to
rhyme with physio,—the verse being—
Punch cares the gout,
The " Colic," and the "ptisic,"
And it is allowed to bo (three times)
The very best of physic.
If by "Punch" were meant the periodical in which
this essay appears, then everyone with the command of
threepence would be able to cure himself by the expendi-
ture of that trifling, but never better spent, amount.
But, alas, it is not so—and as to the awful concoction
known as "Punch," by whomsoever made, whether
bottled, cold, or in the bowl, hot, let him who shall dare
to say that it is any specific for Colic (we needn't trouble
ourselves about "ptisic"), or remedy for the mildest
attack of that excruciating malady, be henceforth and
for ever anathema. Well, that song led me astray;
"the Colic!" who would care for a complaint which you
laughed at with boon companions round the bowl—almost
drinking its health—and which everyone of a jovial tem-
perament put on a par with the imaginary ptisic," or
joked about, out of the song, as Collywobbles, or very
contemptuously as "wobbles without the " colly."
In later days, when " collies" were the fashion, it oc-
curred to me that the Colly-wobbles might be " wobbles"
peculiar to this class of .dog, as " staggers " are peculiar
to horses. But I dismiss this, as it nas no bearing on
the comic aspect in which I had come to regard this
complaint. What finally fixed my idea of it was seeing
at my friend BOODELS' a drawing by GEOBGE CB.TJIX-
SHANK, called "The Colic." It represented an old-
fashioned elderly spinster, in an old-fashioned dress—
date about the Waterloo period—with a cord tightly
bound* round her waist, at each end of which were little
comic imps viciously pulling with all their might and
main, and doing their utmost to bisect the unhappy
elderly Lady at a given point. The elderly spinster was
represented as holding her hands to her hips, and her face
was expressive of the most excruciating agony.
Unfortunately, like the mishaps which happening in a
Pantomime ought to cause intense suffering to the oaby,
who is sat upon and smashed, to the nurse, who runs
away screaming, to the tall man, whose head comes off
(without much apparent inconvenience to himself), and
to the policeman who is shot out of a cannon and his limbs
scattered about (till subsequently collected and put to-
gether by some ingenious process), but which only provoke
the spectator to shouts of laughter, these torments as
depicted by the late GEOKGE CKCTKSHANK in his own
inimitable fashion, simply amused me, specially as the
Artist had slily pointed the moral by introducing on the
wall a portrait of the sufferer herself in her previously
robust health, standing at a spirit-cupboard, and holding
a rum-bottle to her lips, with her head well thrown
back. "Oho," said I, "that was what used to bring
on the old-fashioned Colic at the Waterloo period,—or
more correctly the Eummilies period,—was it? Well,
thank Goodness, we don't do that nowadays; and at all
events I never"—and so on (I admit it now), in the most
pharasaic style.
But the other day—no matter how—no matter when—
suddenly I was laid up. I writhed with pain; I tossed

about; I rolled from side to side; I groaned and groaned till I wa
afraid the neighbours would send in to ask me to go and groan some
where else. I kept on groaning—it was a relief—a great relief. Even
people at a meeting, who don't agree with the speaker's sentiments
or who don't approve of some one he has mentioned, groan, and it
relieves them. When I am ill, what is the use of " silent suffering?'
If you want real sympathy and pity, groan. Don't overdo it: a'
unequal intervals is the best for sympathy. Then, as I got worse, up
sprang old cowardly enemies, led by a force under command o:
General Gout in my left foot, and attacked me in the most cowardly
and dastardly manner. Within a few hours I was prostrated
writhing and groaning.
Then came the Doctor. He prescribed. I became a trifle better,
and, on the first opportunity (after two days of it), but before ]
had reached the improved stage when I could wait to consider whether
I should groan or not, I asked him (as I always like to know),
"Doctor, what have I been suffering from?"
"Well," he replied, thoughtfully, "a complication"
"Yes, yes, I know that," I interrupted, impatiently; "but wha)
began it r—what gave me all the pain? I 've had a sharp attack oi
something. What is it?"
He hesitated. A light—a light that had broken in upon mo when
I was in one of my worst writhings at night—a revelation that came
upon me when my head was hot, when idiotic fantastic faces, in
white cooks' caps, (the ghosts of past good dinners) would come in
crowds and grimace and gibber at me—that light by which, in those
long, weary hours, I had seen re-produced in a waking vision CRTJIK-
SHANX'S picture of the elderly spinster in tortures—that light which,
at the same time, had shown me three jovial souls, seated at a
round table, singing that verse I have already quoted—that light
which had brought back to me the Shakspcarian Clown cutting jokes
at WIDDICOSIB'S expense, while I was in agonies, and the clock
was monotonously ticking oft the minutes in that hard, unsympathetic
manner, so remarkable in all clocks in a sick room,—that light broke
upon me now, as I raised myself up in bed, and, looking him straight
in the face, said, "Doctor, I know. I have had an attack of the
'Colic'!"
"You have," he replied, as if he were surprised at my naming it.
"It has been a sharp attack?" I inquired.
"Very," he answered, emphatically.
"Doctor," I asked, diffidently, " ' Colic' is an old-fashioned com-
plaint "—he assented—"and I have always associated it with
f Collvwobbles.'" He smiled. "It is not that, is it?"
"Certainly not," he replied..
"Then I have been wrong in considering ' Colic' as a comic com-
plaint, eh, Doctor P"
"Comic!" he exclaimed, utterly astonished. Then, shaking his
head slowly, he said. "It's the very reverse of comic. The pain is
most severe; and, when the"
But here he went into a technical description of the malady. It
was very learned, and ho even gave me the Latin word for it, which
would be used in the Medical Scientific Dictionary; but the Colic
by any other name would be as painful. One thing, however, I vow
—that never again will I speak disrespectfully of the Colic, and
never, never, never, never smile at, or countenance, any playful
allusion to this malady by the style and title of "Collywobbles."

squandered my income lavishly on high-class cigars, giving often as
much as five farthings a-piece for the most remarkable brands. The
mischief done to my health was appalling, and, spite the character
and quality of the tobacco, I was continually seized with vertigo,
nausea, paralytic amaurosis, intermittent mania, and aU the symptoms
of diphtheric tetanus. An accident came to my rescue. A friend
recommended me one day to try a cigar of which he was able, by a
fortunate chance, to let me have seventy-five boxes at a figure that
brought down the price to about something like forty a shilling. I
did not mind this for a really good cigar, and took the whole con-
signment. I at once tried a sample of my new purchase. Incredible
is it may sound, I gave up smoking then and there. When my
Friends, inveterate smokers, dined with me, I put these fine cigars
jefore them. They have all gradually given up smoking—at my
louse. You may regard this as a curious phenomenon, but it is the
;ase; and I leave " A RESIGNED VICTIM" to account for it as best
le can, and inspect, if he likes, the seventy-four surplus boxes that,
;hough now in prime condition, still remain, somehow, on the hands
f one who where a cigar is concerned has always considered himself

TO BE CONTINUED IN TWO PARTS."
(The way to settle tlte Hyde Park Corner difficulty.}
THERE is no doubt that those who destroy should also be able to
construct. Reform means a change of pattern, not an eating-up of
material. Thus, a heavy responsibility rests upon those who pulled
down the Duke of WELLINGTON'S Statue—to put it up again.
Where? Echo answers, "Air!" And there is something in the
idea of sending it up high-sky-high, over a charge of gunpowder.
Still, this would be a primitive method of dealing with the scandal,
the more especially as many may think that the Statue has been
blown up enough already. So, discarding Echo's suggestion, it will
be necessary to discover another answer to "What to do with it?"
The latest iclea, to " melt it down," seems crude.
As a preliminary it may be as well to consider the work of Art—it
must be of Art, for it certainly has nothing to do with Nature!—as a
whole. Then, regarded as a whole, the Statue seems to be easily divisible
into two parts—the horse and the rider. How these two parts ever
came together, it is difficulttounderstand, unless the work was executed
O

The Horse without the Rider. The " Steed " in the Circle.
by contract. The horse is evidently on the worst possible terms
with his rider. He is stretching out his head as if in search of food,
and seems to be on the eve of walking into a stable low enough to
unseat his rider as he passes through. On the other hand, the Duke
appears to be supremely unconscious that he is on horseback. He
apparently is giving his whole mind to the rather absurd task he has
set himself—to shoot some small birds with a telescope. Thus it
may be convenient to separate these incongruous companions who,
after so many years of forced neighbourship, no doubt regard each
other with familiarly-engendered contempt.
As the nobler creature (purely, of course, from an artistic point of
view), priority for the horse. At a glance it will be seen that the
charger cannot be used as a saddler's dummy for the display of
harness. His attitude is too absurd for any purpose of that sort.
However, there is a refuge open to him. A comic horse is always
popular in a Circus. Any quadruped of ordinary intelligence can
escape the shafts of the bathing-machine for almost an unlimited
time by learning how to find a handkerchief concealed in a heap of
sawdust placed in an accustomed spot; or, better still, bjr taking "a
glass of sherry wine with the Clown." Thus, bv fitting up the
statue of the horse with a little simple machinery, ne would become
quite an attraction at HENGLEE'S, SANGEH'S, or any other well-known
hippodrome.
Having disposed of the charger, "the hero of a hundred fights"
remains, and fortunately a capital site is waiting to receive him. He
is certainly ridiculous. This is as it should be, as the pedestal that
should be given to him is equally grotesque. It is generally imagined
that there is a magnificent monument to the Iron Duke in St. Paul's
Cathedral. Nine people out of ten, if asked what they thought of
the Wellington Memorial in WREN'S masterpiece, would answer,
"Oh, it's very grand—in fact, splendid." Such a reply would only
prove that nine persons out of ten never visit the Church of the
Metropolis from one year's end to another. It has been asserted
that the Dean and Chapter have acted in a foolish spirit in placing
this " grand monument" in an out-of-the-wav corner with a screen
in front of it to make it the more difficult of identification. This is
unjust to the Cathedral dignitaries, who have shown much wisdom
and discrimination in their choice of a site for what may be also
aptly called a sight! But such a sight! The effigy of the Iron Duke
is resting upon a stretcher, which has been placed upon a sarcophagus
three sizes too small for it. The Sculptor has evidently observed the
insufficiency of the accommodation provided, as he has called in the
assistance of some cherubim, who are doing their level best to keep
the stretcher from tumbling over. The sarcophagus itself rests upon
the feeblest of foundations. A lot of miscellaneous armour has been
piled into a heap, and this heap serves as a stand for the diminutive
sarcophagus and the extra-sized stretcher. Up above, on an arch,
are two pairs of Ladies
and Gentlemen. The first
pair, to the West of the
monument, consists of a
skittish young female
thrusting a male would-
be football player off a
pedestal. It will be ad-
mitted at once that the
idea is admirable as a
practical joke. Regarded
however as an ornament
to the interior of a
Cathedral, it is, to say
the least, unsuitable. On
the Eastern side a Lady
is literally "sitting" upon
a Gentleman, who is
grumblingly bearing her
weight on a shield. This,
too, is funny but foolish.
Fortunately the top of the
monument has no statue,
and here the effigy of the
Iron Duke now resting at
Hyde Park Corner might
be placed with the most
telling effect. No doubt
it would be rather tall for
the present chapel, but
the roof might be removed
to allow of the head

appearing in the next storey. A clerk's stool would serve as an
excellent support to the horseless rider.
Thus finished, the monument, taken as a whole, would be assuredly
judged incapable of further improvement. The door of the screen
might then be locked, and the key lost, and (who knows ?) in years
to come the Statue might be forgotten! But before shutting the
door for good, it would be as well to add the Griffin and other equally
appreciated works of Art to the collection, so that the space of the
to-be-sealed-up chapel should be fully utilised.
Should the above scheme be adopted, the greatest benefit to the
community would be immediately secured. However, should senti-
mentalists object to a plan so sensible, so reasonable, there is only
one alternative. Instead of regarding the monument as a whole, it
should be gazed upon in a hole. Someone should dig a pit large
enough for the reception of the Statue. The horse and his rider
should be slipped in, and then the opening should be filled up. This
would be following the precedent set in the case of the Statue of
CHABLF.S THE FIRST. However, in the case of CHAELES THE FIRST the
exact spot where the Statue was buried was remembered. In the
case of the Iron Duke The remainder of the sentence is obvious.

Park? Jest as well talk of all Kent as a feller's back-garden, you see;
And there's me thought that Paddington plan as owdacious a dodge as

I oppoged it, in course, tooth and nail, as a vile waste of building-plots. Yes,
But Three Thousand Three Hunderd Square Miles! Oh! it puts one's ideas in

And so I read on quite relieved. But, lor" bless yer, it wasn't no go.

Surpasses the wunderflest dreams of the poets, from TTTPPEE to OBBIS.
Though I must say as geysers, and spouts, Gobling Laby-

As the whole of that Yallerstone "lot"—wich ten

Is "reserved and withdrawn" from the builders and

But after this Yallerstone game they '11 be fifty times

Wich I thought Uncle Sam 'ad more sense than to chuck

fish, woods and foresta would pay:
And though biling spouts and huge gulfs, as the Times
sez, may savour of Tophet,

All I 'ope is it may not be ketching. Jest think if the

We ain't got no Yallerstone range, but that our Open

To NORRIS'S 'ideous tip is the warm hasperation of
BUMBLE!
IN the case of Heaven v. Fender—which, if there
were anything in names, sounds as if the plaintiff must
get far and away, very tar and away, the best of it—the
Judge of the Bow County Court (whence it came up to
the Court of Appeal) thought that the plaintiff, a working
painter, who had fallen and been injured in the course
of his work, " was entitled to recover." That was some
consolation to begin with; but the conscientious County
Court Judge reserved the point, which: after being
argued several months ago, was only decided last week,
by which time it is to be hoped the painter had thoroughly
recovered, as he was " entitled" to do, from his injuries.
The appeal was decided in his favour, their Lordships
expressing their surprise that the amount of damage
claimed was only twenty pounds. Fiat justitia ruat
Coelum. Poor Coelum, after all, can hardly be said to
have fallen on his legs. Can the poor painter be assisted
from the Royal Academy Charitable Fund?
A PROPOS of the Suez Canal, of which subject everyone
is just now heartily tired, Mr. COTTON wrote a letter to
the Times last week, commencing—
"SIR,—As I had no opportunity of addressing the House on
Monday evening last, I shall esteem it a favour if you will kindly
permit me to make the following remarks in the columns of the
AMI."
Good Heavens! if the Editor of the Leading Journal
should allow all the Silent Members who, night after
night, have no opportunity of addressing the House, to
make their unspoken speeches in print, what would
become of the news, the telegrams, and the leading
articles? Let us hope that this will not be considered
as a precedent, and that the cautious Editor of the Times
will intimate to Mr. COTTON, should he want to run
another few lines off his reel, that it reelly won't do.
WHTLE OUIDA was writing her latest novel, it was
noticed that she was more distraite and eccentric than
was usual with her. The reason is now evident. She
had been struck by an idea, and had taken to Wanda in
her mind. What a wanda-ful mind!

EXTIIACTED PROM
THE DIAKY OF TOBY, M.P.

THE PARLIAMENTARY PAIRING SEASON.
"The restrictions upon Pairing have now been relaxed, and it is expected that by the end of the week a largo number of Members will hare left town."
Standard, July 31.
House of Commons, Monday Night, July 30.—Mr. SMALI,. the
latest messenger of peace from Ireland, made a start to-night as
legislator. Asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Local Govern-
ment Board whether he knew to what hour the Master of the Poland
Street Workhouse stopped out at night, and whether he was in
possession of any information that went to show hisjaverage hour of
going to bed? Keally feel necessity of saying this is not a joke;
matter of solemn and serious fact. SMALL gravely gave notice of
this question; it appears in printed list of fif ty-eight addressed to
Ministers to-day. When turn came, SPEAKER called upon him, and
he rose in High Court of Parliament, put the question, and Parlia-
mentary Secretary of Local Government Board, with equal gravity,
answered him!
"It "s his modesty/' said Mr. GIBSON. "Am not sure whether
he's an Irishman born and bred, but representing an Irish constitu-
ency is enough to inculcate principles of modesty. SMALL'B his
name, and small's his question. But it is better to begin in a small
way and work upward than start at the other end and come down."
Understand that this sort of thing is likely to extend. Mr. 111 \ i v
will give notice to ask PRIME JInttSTER whether it is irue that the
Charwoman of the House of Commons has broiled bacon for breakfast,
and, if so, how much?
Mr. BIGGAR to ask the HOME SECRETARY whether he is in posses-
sion of any information he can communicate to the House as to
rumour of Policeman A 278 having been observed in area of house in
Belgrave Square, and whether there is any reason to suspect he was
in communication with the Cook?
Mr. O'DoNNELL to ask the Under-Secretary of State for India
whether he can inform the House at what hour in the morning the
Guikwar of Baroda gets up, and which side of the bed he is accus-
tomed to select for descent t
These only sample of questions framed on basis of Mr. SMALL'S.
In every case where unsatisfactory answer is giv«n, Adjournment
will be moved.

morning.
"BLAKE did it." TREVELYAlfyawned, as we walked home together.
"BIGGAR spotted him in the Gallery, and they determined to make
the most of the opportunity. Don't often see a resident Magistrate
except on the Bench, and then he has rather advantage of them.

So SPEAKER put the question to him solus, as if he were the whole
House of Commons, "will you vote Aye or No ?" says SPEAKER.
"Aye," says CAVENDISH, in firm voice, feeling called upon to
sustain the dignity of the House. So his intelligent and valuable
support reckoned to " Ayes," and CAVENDISH retired to make a quiet
inspection of both Lobbies, and learn once for all which is the " Aye"
and which is the " No."
"Used to manage it once," he says, "by turning up cuff of right
sleeve. 'No' Lobby on the side coming in. But somehow it was not
there when you went out. Quite reversed, in fact. Never could
make it out. Then hit on scheme of watching Irish Members. They
always go into 'No' Lobby. Consequently other must be 'Aye.'
But once, out of pure cussedness, they changed about, and I got into
mess. Mosh remarkable things thesh Lobbies. Sort of thing no
fellow can understand."
Business done.—English Agricultural Holdings Bill read Third
Time.
Wednesday.—Scotch Agricultural Holdings Bill carried through
report stage by little strategy. At a Quarter to Six rule of House
required Debate to be adjourned. Everything was settled except the
formal question that the Report be agreed to. Should OTWAY make a
plunee and put question?
"We 're over the border," he whispered to Sir FARRAR HEKSCHEL,
nervously looking at clock.
"Never mind, said the SOLICITOR-GENERAL, "many questionable
things been done on the Scotch Border."
"Well, I'll go Farrar and hope we won't fare worse," said the
Chairman; and he did, putting the question, declaring the Report
Stage carried and getting out of the Chair as quickly as possible.
'If there's a row perhaps the SPEAKER had better deal with it. I
must, go and write a letter."
There was a row, of course. TIM HEALY indignantly protested
against breach of Rules, backed up by CALLAN.
"If there's one thing that hurts me in this House," said TIM, "it
is to see any breach of order." "And me, too," said PHIL CALLAN.
But SPEAKER waved off champions of order and went on with business.
Scotch Members said nothing; were in truth exhausted with
excitement of earlier scene. House being cleared for a Division,
DALRYMPLE rose to address Chairman. Dragged down by coat-
tails. Reminded he could speak at present juncture only seated, and
with hat on. On other side, LORD-ADVOCATE also held down by
main force. "Put your hat on!" they hissed in his ear.
But LORD-ADVOCATE in same position as PREMIER when similar
crisis arose last Session. Hadn't got a hat with him. MORGAN
OSBORSE proffers his, which, after critical examination, LORD-ADVO-
CATE declines. Mr. DUFF forces his upon Right Hon. Gentleman.
He takes it in hand, turns it round once or twice, and hands it back.
SOLICITOR-GENERAL, warned bv former experience, makes no offer.
Remembers how his hat wouldn't do more than cover a few bumps
on massive brow of PREMIER. Not going to run that risk again.
Other hats pressed upon LORD-ADVOCATE. Examines each care-
fully, but, apparently for various reasons, rejects them in turn.
"Never saw a man so particular about a hat," said JUDGE-ADVO-
CATE-GENERAL, evidently nuifed. "Thinks he's going to be charged
for the loan." Whilst LORD-ADVOCATE hesitates, time flies, sand
falls in glass, question put, and opportunity gone.
Business done.—English Agricultural Holdings Bill read Third
Time; Scotch passed the Report Stage.
Thursday.—PREMIER questioned as to date of Prorogation, says he
"has not laid aside the hope that it may take place on the 25th."
Members assume air of agonised resignation. The 25th is Christmas
Day, and of course they must adjourn then, if only for a week.
Thought perhaps they might get. off by 25th November. PREMIER
explains; means 25th of August. General feeling of incredulity,
melting into sentiment of joy.
"Nice state of things we ve come to under Liberal Government,"
says Nestor NEWDEOATE. "House of Commons positively thankful
to get away by the 25th August. Comparatively new Members can
remember when to be here on the 12th August was regarded as high
treason, and House rarely sat after the 8th. They '11 go on from bad
to worse, and during CHAMBERLAIN'S Premiersnip there'll be no
recess except two days at Christmas, and we '11 have the House in
Supply on Good Friday."
House in Supply to-night. Scotch votes under discussion. The
burning question of Chairmanship of Fishery Boards fanned into
blaze again by Sir GEORGE BALFOUR and Mr. BARCLAY. Seems
present Chairman is something in the Stationery line. "Why a
Stationer?" pipes Sir GEOROE BALFOUB in tremulously pathetic
tones. "Why not a retired Lieutenant-General, formerly a member
of the Military Finance Commission of India, Assistant to the
Controller-in-Chief of the War Department, a Liberal, and in favour
of the abolition of the Law of Hypothec. These be qualifications.
But why a Stationer?"
"Why a Stationer?" Mr. BARCLAY asks, his general discontent
with life receiving fresh access as he contemplates an ex-Provost of
Edinburgh in this comfortable berth. "Why not a Merchant Ship-
owner and Farmer, six years Town Councillor of Aberdeen, a Liberal,
and a supporter of Mr. GLADSTONE?"
House answers, "Why?" and proceeds to discuss the vote for
Lion King-at-Arms and the Petty Bag Office, topics which excite the
deepest marvel in HENBY'S ingenuous mind.
'^VTiat is Lion King-at-Arms ?" he asks. '' Got one under the Trea-
sury Bench, or in the Secretary to the Treasury's office? Could he be
brought ii11 to the Bar, or might Hon. Members have an order to see

THE TOAST OF THE (PARLIAMENTARY) SEASON.—The Happy " Pair!"
MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE CITT OF LONDON.
(By Mataulay Stiggins, C.C.)
CHAPTER I.
LONDON was founded by King LUD, as everybody knows; but
very few people know that his Palace was situate in the North-East
corner of Ludgate Circus, and can be viewed at any time between
the hours of nine A.M. and twelve P.M. on applying to the Restaurateur
or Restorer of it. A snail fee is expected by the fair attendant, in
return for which slight refreshments are provided. As the primaeval
inhabitants of London were not a literary race,—and, Indeed, their
descendants have never been distinguished in that particular line—
the King divided the City into twenty-six districts or Wards, so
called from being parts of the large Lock that was connected with
the City Quay. These twenty-six Wards were named after the
letters of the alphabet, as a means of teaching the ignorant inhabi-
tants their ABC.
After a time the Wards were named after their most distinguished
inhabitant, or from some peculiar circumstance connected with them,
and retain their names to this day. For instance, Aldersgate was
named from a row of Elder Trees near the Gate, from the berries of
which fine fruity Port was first made. Bassishaw was so called after
a certain eccentric Bashaw with three tales, which he recited on every
possible occasion, and who resided generally in the Bankruptcy Court
in Basinghall Street in that locality. Candlewick was named after
the inventor of the celebrated farthing rush-lights; he afterwards
retired to Hampton Wick, and died in the odour of tallow. Dowgate,
or Doughgate, was named after the discoverer of the renowned Baking
Powder warranted always to rise to the occasion.
The Ward of Portsoken was obviously named from the jovial habits
of its inhabitants, it being customary for the rude mob to salute them
as they staggered home from the London Tavern as Port Soakers.
Bread Street Ward was inhabited principally by Bakers, who, on
the many occasions when they were convicted of selling bad bread or

giving short weight, were drawn through the City on hurdles for the
first offence, for the second were put in the pillory with a full-sized
mill-stone round their necks; for the third offence they were
banished the City, and had to go and set up in business in the Strand
or over the water. No Baker was allowed to deal in Starch, Alum.
or Potatoes. In the reign of HENBY THE FIRST a penny bun weighed
ten pounds, and, being.so weighty, was called avoirdupois.
Yintry Ward was full of Vintners, always a jovial and prosperous
race. If found guilty of selling bad wine, they were compelled to
drink every drop of it, but not in larger quantities than sixty-three
gallons a week, which measure, from that peculiar custom, was always
called a Pub's Dread, since corrupted by time into Hog's Head.
Billingsgate Ward was so named from the powerful and strictly
classical language spoken in that locality, especially in the far-famed
Fish Market, which was established by EDWARD THE THIRD for the
benefit not only of Corporations in general, but of the Corporation of
the City of London in particular, who, after enjoying their rather
fishy monopoly for about five hundred years, generously gave it up, and
allowed all kinds of fish to go to the cheapest Market, except smelts.
Broad Street Ward was so called because, being the home of the
Stock Exchange, it was denounced by the first Bisnop of London as
the Broad Way that leadeth to destruction.
The principal Officers of the City were originally the Lord Mayor's
Fool, the principal Gorger, who tested the food, and the principal
Gauger. who tested the drink. The oldest inhabitant of each Ward
was called its Elder, or Alderman, and about a dozen of the commonest
fellows in each Ward, who had nothing better to do, were called
Common Councilmea, and their principal duty in those wild days
was to keep watch over the City by night, their reward being an
ample supply of the food that had been tested by the principal
Gorger, and of the drink that had been tested by the principal
Gauger; but, as the best wine was sold at fivepence per gallon,
probably they did not consume any great quantity. They also
received twopence per night.
As no one was allowed to leave his house after Curfew, the duties
of the Common Councilmen were probably not over burthensome. In
the reign of CHARLES THE FIRST they were superseded by Parochial
Dogberries, who were dressed in white great coats, and called
Charlies. In the reign of WILLIAM THE FOURTH their coats were
taken from them, and they were consequently called Peelers, but
afterwards, as their wages were paid in shillings, Bobs, or Bobbies.
The Saxon English of those days was of the purest character: for
example, we read that "JOHN GOLLTLOLLY the Dieghere left Whyt-
crouchstrete for Grenewyches."
Bribery and treating seem to have flourished like a green bay-tree:
for instance, twelve salt fish, a swan, six rabbits, and one hundred
shillings were sent by the Sheriffs to WILLIAM OVERDONE for his
Christmas box, who must have felt a little overdone on Boxing Day.
WILLIAM FULLBURN. Baron of the Exchequer, had for Christmas
twenty salt fish, value 6s., one hat of beaver, lined with cloth of
scarlet, value 7s. 6flf., together with bread, wine, and poultry; and
Sir WILLIAM DE NOHWICH received one swan and six capons for
Christmas; [and for Easter, one beef carcass, one pig. one veal,
twelve capons, and a silver-nit Ewer, value 26*. 6rf., so his services
must have been great indeed to be so bounteously rewarded.
It is satisfactory to know that in Mr. Punch's own Ward a gallant
draper, named JOHN GEDENEY, absolutely refused to serve the office
of Alderman! He was thereupon sent to Prison, and his shops
closed,,and his goods and chattels sequestrated. His proud spirit
was thus broken, and he consented to serve the hated office, which he
did for twelve long years.; ^ Tiring a portion of which time he had to
do penance for marrying a widow who had made a vow of chastity.
This seems a singular Law, and rather difficult of comprehension:—
The fare of a boat full of people from London to Westminster was
twopence, but after it was full the price was threepence.
The Lieutenancy of the City of London was created by HENBY THE
SEVENTH, who, being a very stingy Monarch, compelled every man
who left his tenancy in arrear of rent to join the Army or pay a fine
of ever so many marks. In process of time, what had been_ con-
sidered a disgrace came to be regarded as an honour, and when it was
kindly enacted that they should never be sent out of the Country,
except in case of an invasion, all the wealthy Bankers and princely
Merchants petitioned to be added to the Corps, whose brilliant
uniform is as much an object of envy to Civilians as of wonder to the
regular Army. They are forbidden to draw their swords, exo«pt «n
Lord Mayor's Day.

A LIGHT POINT OF LAW.
THE Late Dr. FORBES WINS-
LOW, the well-known authority
upon mental ailments, once
wrote a very excellent book,
called Light, wherein the
title-subject was treated ex-
haustively. A few days ago,
in a case relative to the copy-
right in photographs, the claim
of the Bun to derive profits
from the sale of his own Sun-
pictures was seriously argued,
on the score that the luminary
in question might be considered
their "Author!" Had this
point been decided in favour of
the centre of the Solar System
a dozen years ago, the learned
writer might have found
materials for an additional
chapter to one of his volumes.
But it is probable that, in deal-
ing with it, he would have
discarded Light in favour of
his standard work upon The
Obscure Diseases of the Brain!
AMONG the remarkable in-
stances of escape during the
terrible earthquake at Ischia
were those of Prince BADINI
and his son, who were playing
cards, the entire audience at
the theatre, and the actors,
among whom was a comedian,
one PETITO, in a Punchinello's
costume. Facts worth noting
by the Pharisaical denouncers
ol cardplaying, theatrical en-
tertainments, and actors.

INTERNATIONAL CRICKET.
(A further Extension of the British Umpire.)
THE growing tendency to give an International character to all
friendly athletic contests having decided the Committee responsible
for the recent new table of "the Amended Laws of Cricket" to send
a draught of the document to the sporting representatives of several
leading Continental and other nations, the following satisfactory,
and in some measure important modifications and suggestions have,
up to date, been received by the Secretary. It is understood that
the Committee will at once resume their labours, with a view to
putting the new material, as far as is possible, into some practicable
shape, so that the great, though hitherto exclusively English game
may at length possess a truly cosmopolitan character:—
FRENCH.
(From the " General-en- Chef" of " Le Trou-blue Club de Jeu de
Cricquette " at Ainieres.)
1. Let wicquettes shall be six-feet high, and one and one-half of a
foot broad. This will make them visible to the bowlsman, and be a
protection to the "keepere."
2. The "keepere" shall stand behind the "wicquettes" in a
•sentry-box. When there is a commotion, he may leave this. But,
on the cry of " Play!" reaching his ear from the gentleman umpire, he
shall retreat again for protection into the box, and wait "the bye."
Then he shall emerge.
3. The dress of the batsman is, for the legs and chest, iron. There
should be a casque, also, on the head, of this metal. In the/CM Anglais,
which is played with a boulet de canon of excessive circumference,
this will give confidence.
4. If the weight of the protective armour produces on the batsman
a regrettable embarrassment, he must, when desirous of making the
run, have recourse to the "drive."
5. The drive should be the drive for six. This will be in a light
omnibus, and the batsman can take with him the bowlsman, the
keepere, M. le Long-on, Points, Squarr-leg, and the gentleman
umpire. When the field is large, this excursion is enjoyable, and
mounts the score.
6. For the "French-game," the ball is not so terrible, being of
flannel, gaily coloured, enclosing air, and may be approached, even
by the slip, with cheerful tfan. When the ball is thus innocent, the
dress of the batsman may correspond. He can wear pantalom of
satin, spike shoes, epaulettes, and a crimson "top-at."
7. If the batsman encounter difficulty in his effort to beat the ball,
thus light and of agreeable appearance, to a desirable distance, he
may pursue it furiously with successive strokes to the quarter he
has selected for his "It"
8. When the gentleman umpire perceives that bv this process of
producing the " it." there is nothing left of the ball wherewith to
continue the Match further, he will rush to the scoresman and loudly
proclaim, "No ball!"
9. This proclamation of the " No ball" to the scoresman concludes
the Match, which is now said to be an "over."
RUSSIAN.
(Notes from the Ledger of the Imperial Romanoff Cricketing Society.
1. The wickets must not be pitched on the field selected for tiie
Match, but somewhere else, known only, the night before, to the Chief
of the Police, the Governor of Moscow, and, in special cases, to the
Metropolitan of Cracow.
2. If the entire ground should be blown up in the middle of a
game, the out Eleven lose their innings.

3. The ball must not be filled with* dynamite, except when an

4. It is understood that the destination of both umpires, after the
Match, is Siberia.
5. The CZAB can go in when he likes, and never gets out.
AMERICAN.
(From the Slickville, U.S.A., Fair Play Wanderers' Club.)
RULES 1 to 45 (British style) can be taken as fixed right enough.
46. Deals with the umpire. Thus:—An umpire shall be boss of
the money going on any given Match; but to put his character above
suspicion, he mustn't be known to have been bought more than five
times deep by both sides.
47. He shall not be got at earlier than three clear months before
the date fixed for the game.
48. Drugs may be given to the bowler the same, and of the same
strength as at the London Marylebone Club, St. John's Wood.
49. While one Eleven is in the field, the captain of the other may
"educate" the refreshments. But he must stop at Nux Vomica,
Strychnine, the stronger Bromides, and BUNKER'S Family Knock-me-
down. N.B.—It is smarter cricket to keep the last in hand for a
second innings, where the play is a good deal speculative.
50. The wicket-keeper may have an eight-shooter inside his knee-
pad; but he mustn't introduce it freely into an innings until there's
an unpleasantness about the gate-money, or till one of the umpires
has had a hole made through him, in a temper, by the last man out.
THE BAJJEHWEE ISLANDERS.
(From the New Fetish-Sail and Thigh-bone Club Customs
Register.)
1. The toss for the innings shall be decided by the meeting of the
two Elevens in ambush at daybreak, armed with the Curjin, or sacred
Bajjerwee brain-knife.
2. What is left of the two Elevens after "the toss," shall then
commence the Match with a war-dance \ the wickets having been
previously covered with fresh tripe in .anticipation of victory.
3. The ball shall be the skull of the Honorary Secretary of the
local cricket-ground, lent for the occasion.
4. The victorious Eleven will eat their opponents at the conclusion
of the game.
5. The skin of each umpire shall belong respectively to the family
of the opposing long-stop.
Other suggestions are pouring in fast; and one, that both Elevens
should go in simultaneously in top-boots, and armed to the teeth, on
horseback, sent by a Kirghis K lum, has been well received by those
anembers of the Committee who are in favour of rapid cricket and the
one-day Match system. At present the desirability of ironing out
the bowling, and keeping the champagne on the popping crease, is
occupying much attention. Rule 40, enjoining on the wicket-keeper
the necessity of not making any noise to impede or startle the bats-
man, is to be further amplified. He will not be permitted to stand
on his head, suddenly imitate the cackling of poultry, trip up the
hitter, or, on the delivery of a ball, sing " Tom Bowling" without a
protest from the umpire. It is decided, too, that the stumps will in
future not be drawn, but photographed. The issue of the Com-
mittee's report is awaited with much interest.

CHILDE CHAPPIE'S PILGRIMAGE.
r..\ NT o THE FIRST.;
i.
OH, thou! so oft invoked in gloom or .mirth,
Muse! pay or sombre, at the warbler's will;
Heaven-lit,, or touched with lurid
fires of earth,
Wilt thou once more forsake thy
tri-forked hill,
Or let me dip in thy much haunted
rill
Lips little used to aught save
earth's red wine?
Lo! WHITMAN, WILDE, and TCP-
PEE twangle still,
Perchance the most good-natured
of the Nine
Will eTett-deign-to-graoe-a-pwwy-
tale like mine.
n.
Lately in London's maze there
dwelt a youth,
Who in that aimless labyrinth
took delight.
He skimmed his World, he trifled with his Troth,
He watched Burlesque's belauded lamp at night.
Ah me! he was in sooth a shallow wight,
Much given to crackling chaff and hollow glee;
Few earthly things found favour in his sight,
Save ballet belles and bibulous company,
And Turf dom's sordid thralls of high or low degree.
m.
CMlde CHAPPIE was he hight:—but whence that name—
A sobriquet—it needeth net to say;• - - -
Suffice it that it was of modish fame,
Like "buck" or " dandy" of an earlier day;
For town's loud losel-swarms, gregarious aye,
Are now, as in. the mightier olden time,
Slow, sheep-like souls, informing common clay";
Not all Society Journals' prose or rhyme
Can make their dull wits bright, their stupid lives sublime.
IV.
l Childe CHAPPIE basked in Fashion's fullest sun,
; Disporting in Mayfair like a Mayfly,
Heedless that when his little day was done
Came the long night of moody misery
That lesser insects know not; the dull eye
And nerveless hand of the exhausted " Swell,"
The desert waste of dull satiety,
That loathly limbo where drear memories dwell.
.More joyless and more lone than eremite's dark oelL
v.
As yet Childe CHAPPIE was alert of heart,
And with his fellow-frolickers would flee
From home's calm haven, forum, fane, and mart,
For cynic scorn congealed all fantasy
And quick affection of fresh youth, and he
Regarded these as tame and awfully slow."
He loved all haunts of modish revelry,
Where pleasure rolled in full and feverish flow.
And e'en for change of scene descended yet more low.
VI.
And none did love him, though the town he 'd scour
With youths who called him bonny boy" and " dear.'
These were but comrades of the cheery hour,
The sharers of his " fizz " or bitter beer.
Yea, none did love him—not his chum most near,
Nor she who willingly his gifts would wear,
For only the false Eros haunt* the sphere
Where folly's moths dance in the blinding glare,
And callous Circe flaunts in aureate-tinted nair.
YD.
But after his first " Supper," wild with glee,
He seized his banjo, which the youth could string
And twangle, for to nigger minstrelsy
He long had found high zest in listening;
And now his fingers o er it he did fling,
And piped a farewell in fahetto high,
His boon.companions loudly chorussing.
And with the " Boy" the beakers were brimmed high,
While to his'early haunts he piped his last " Good-bye!'
1.
Adieu! adieu! Home'.life 's a bore
When one is twenty-two;
lights were not given to snooze and
snore,
Day's hours are all too few.
iVTien the sun sets o'er land and sea,
Life's beacon blazes high,
farewell, domestic fiddle-de-dee!
My early Home—good-bye!
2.
A few short hours, and Sol will rise,
To give grey morning birth;
We shall be prone with sleep-crown'd
eyes,
Dreaming of night's mad mirth:
Whilst yonder, round my father's-hall,
My sisters, dear, but dull,
Will toss this early tennis-ball,
Or pull the morning scull.
3.
Let love be hot, let wine run high,
I fear not love or wine.
From tame delights of home I fly,
Life's fiery press be mine!
I mean to do the whole'mad round,
Stage, Sport, Club, Friendship,
Love;
For in these things do joys abound
Home's doldrums far above.
4.
My sire will " rowi" me vigorously,
My mother sore complain,
But o'er life's wildest waves I '11
fly
Ere I touch shore again.
Let sermons scare the goody-good
From " Stage," or Bar, or Ring;
But I, who am of gayer mood,
Intend to have my fling.

With, ye, my bonny boys, I '11 go
The fastest pace that's set;
With hopes to lead the field, youknow,
And cut all record yet.
Welcome, the riskiest game that's
on!
Brim, brim the beaker high!

HOW TO MAKE THE "A. P." HAPPY.
(A Fragment that ought to be picked up in the Twentieth Century.)
THE poor Old Man woke after his sleep of just a score of years. He had fallen
off to slumber after the Alexandra Park had oeen closed, as a place of entertain-
ment, to the Public. His drowsiness had been caused by the tones of a popular
lecturer. He was recalled to consciousness by the bright voices of clean-looking
children. A particularly cheery lad was standing beside him.
"Pardon, Monsieur, mats vous etes ?" said the boy to the Old Man, in
excellent French. RIP was too feeble to reply.
Then the lad addressed him in ten different modern languages, each of which
he pronounced without the vestige of a British accent.
I do not understand you!" gasped the Veteran.
"English!" exclaimed the lad. Why, from your poverty-stricken appear-
ance, I believed you to be a foreigner. But allow me—you require refreshment."
And before RIP could answer a word, the lad had felt the Old Man's pulse,
and administered a restorative.
"I know a little about medicine," the boy observed, with a smile. "In fact,
I know a little about everything. My weakest point is my knowledge of languages.
I frankly confess that I scarcely know a dozen words of Chinese; and as for
Hebrew, I only read—not speak it."
"You must be some young Gentleman of quality? "queried RIP, now perfectly
recovered from his recent fatigue.
"I 'm only the son of a bricklayer, and come from an educational establish-
ment that has been recently opened in the neighbourhood. I belong to the
Universal School (originated by the Combined Metropolitan School Boards), and
am one of the dullest of its scholars."
"Marvellous!" murmured the Old Man. "And now, as my eyesight is
rather weak, can you describe my surroundings P"
"Certainly!" promptly responded the lad. "Yonder is a ground used exclu-
sively for athletic exercises. Many years ago, the same spot was a race-course.
But we have improved upon that. The large building at the top of the hill
is a public library, very extensively frequented on a Saturday afternoon by
the oostermongers. That Park to the right is a very perfect botanical garden,
much in favour with the coalheavers, who have recently devoted the greater
portion of their leisure moments to the consideration 01 the European flora.
Beyond, a cricket-ground, a croquet-lawn, and a field devoted to archery. The
public swimming-bath (once private property) is also a feature. That excellent
road TnTiriing Up from the Railway Station (in conjunction with the Metro-
politan line, upon which engines worked by compressed air are, as you probably
know, now only allowed to be used), to the Farthing fish-dinner Saloon, is made
from the ohopped-up stones once forming Temple Bar. Then"
"But where am I?" asked RiP, impatiently interrupting the boy as he was
about to describe a hundred other improvements.
"Where are yon!" echoed the lad. "Why, in the grounds of the old
Alexandra Palace."
"But to whom does it belong?"
"To the People, of course," replied the urchin. "Twenty years ago the place

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
;DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

A DISCORD. IN BLACK AND WHITE.
House of Commons, Monday Night, August 6.—Great sensation
in House to-night. Appearance of FORSTER in military uniform.
Marched up House with sword clanking at heel. Gave military
salute to SPEAKER. Found Dr. LYONS in his seat. Significantly
touched hilt of sword. Doctor beat hasty retreat, and Right Hon.
Gentleman, entrenching chin behind stock, threw out his hair in
skirmishing order, and deploying; his legs so that they formed an
impregnable laager, awaited the sound of the trumpet. It came on
GOBST s Motion to reduce Vote by salary of British Resident in
Transvaal. General FOHSTER then advanced to the front, and,
saluting, made spirit-stirring speech.
"Give me," says he, "five thousand men and a hundred thousand
pounds, and I '11 undertake to make the proud Boer bite the dust.
I'll re-establish MACAHONIE, BLANC MANGE, TirpYTYwrrcmT,LANGY-
G'LANGY, and all the other noble savages for whom it is our duty to
pour forth our blood and treasure. Not our own personal blood, of
course, nor exclusively our own treasure; but the blood of our
soldiers, and the hoarded savings of our taxpayers. For myself, I
will establish a safe basis of operations at Cape Town, and thence
direct operations that shall fill the world with envy and admiration."
"General," I ventured to sayto him, when ho had resumed his
seat amid loud cheers from Mr. WAET^N and Mr. Alderman FOWLEE,
"we 're all proud of you. Believe, if you got the chance, CLITE
would be nowhere; and how well you look in uniform! But aren't
you—hem!—isn't the lower part rather short?"
"YeSj" said our Only Other General, looking down at his legs.
"Fact is, I borrowed ACLAND'S uniform. Much struck with it
when he made speech on moving Address. But 'tis a little short in
places."
Going down Corridor half-an-hour later, met large tree in flower-
pot apparently moving along. Coming nearer, caught glimpses
through foliage of a familiar collar, and presently aware of the
gleaming of a well-known eye.
"Has Birnam Wood come to Dunsinane?"
"No," said Grand Old Man—for 'twas he—" it's come by Parcels
Post. Just carrying It into my room. Mean to refresh myself
occasionally during evening as long as it lasts. Much troubled about
FORSTEB," he added, putting the tr»e down, and dexterously lop-
ping off a branch here and there with his pen-knife. "Gone on
the war-path now. Asks me if I 've given away new Field Marshal-
ship, which, as HAETINGTON says, we 're going to create ' as a certain
kind of compensation to the Army,' because CONNAUGHT 's nobbled
another Colonelcy. Hints that he knows someone who would
just suit the post. But don't see how it's to be done. Give me a
lift up with this pot, dear boy. Thanks. See you again later.
Just been making a speech on Transvaal. Will make another on
Zululand a little after midnight."
Business done.—Votes in Supply.
Tuesday.— WARTON in very subdued frame to-nij?ht. Grand Old
Man made several statements at Question Time, and long speech on
National Debt Bill, and he did not once interrupt him!
Fact is, had a bad time of it this morning. On Saturday, three
Bills he has blocked all Session escaped him. Got into Committee,
and thereafter blocks inoperative. At two o'clock this morning,
SAM MOELEY proposed to go into Committee on one of these, pro-
hibiting'payment of wages m Public-houses. WARTON rose to pro-
test. House, delivered from his thraldom, jeered at him. WAETON,
affected almost to tears, feels for his snuff-box.
"Oh, 'go on!" cries DODDS, in sarcastic tone, like small street-
boy jeering Policeman from safe distance. This too much for
WABTON.
"I appeal to you, Mr. Chairman," he said, in broken voice. "Is
it decorous, when I am taking breath, for an Hon. Member to say
'Go on!'in that way?"
House laughed; WABTON sobbed. "Never mind," said the faithful
TOMLTNSON. handmg him fresh pocket-handkerchief. "Thay would
have jeered at WOLSEY in the hour of his fall." WAHTON still
standing tremulously taking snuff. Sir ARTHUR OTWAY goes on as
if no human soul near at band were in direst anguish.

Each proposal received no other challenge than a sob from WARTON, which, not
being recognised in Parliamentary procedure, passed without notice. Bill through
Committee in five minutes, and Mr. MOELEY, who in some places passes for a

conduct is exceedingly rude," he whimpered.
House ought to have been abashed at this. If WAETON had been in habit of
rudely interrupting other Members, from the PREMIER downwards, it would
have been different. But with his blameless life it was painful to find him
subjected to this. House, however, only laughed. Bill read Third Time, and
WABTON went home through the fresh morning air a Crushed and Heartbroken

Business done.—National Debt Bill read a Second Time.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Members clearing out at increased rate. Pairing the

H. W. SMITH walking on Terrace this afternoon, very neatly dressed. Glazed
straw-hat, several sizes too small, on back of his head; blue shirt widely open
at throat, with black silk handkerchief loosely tied in sailor's knot; short
jacket; trousers exceedingly tight at the knee and round the hips, with much
waste material about the ankles; telescope under arm.
"I think she '11 weather it, Mate," he said, fixing his telescope on a barge
running under the bridge forty yards off. "But with the wind in that quarter,
and a chopping sea, you can never make sure unless the skipper knows every rope.
He "d have done much better if he 'd hauled on the bowliie at Chelsea Bridge,
sorted his starboard scuppers, let go bis taffrail, and put the helem hard a-lee.
But a man must be brought up all his life to the sea, or at least been First
Lord of the Admiralty, before he can thoroughly understand the river."

wide apart, as if the terrace were adrift in a heavy sea.
Business done.—Report of Corrupt Practices Bill.
Thursday.—Irish Members back in force and high
spirits to-night. Paper crowded with Questions. Out of
total of fifty-six they have thirty-two chiefly composed
of parish gossip and Ballydebob slander.
Saves pence and trouble," KENNY explained. "A lot
of us just over from Ireland, peremptorily summoned
by PABNELL. Would have to write or telegraph to say
arrived safely. Instead of that, put question to TBE-
VELYAN in House of Commons about the thickness of the
porridge in Ballymooney Workhouse, or as to whether
it's true that one of the Sub-Commissioners under the
Land Act is not on speaking terms with his mother-in-
law. Question and answer telegraphed to Ireland, and
people at home know we 're all right. Besides, some
of our fellows haven't come up to the scratch, and it "a
well for your constituents to know that you're here
making things hot for the Government."
TBEVELYAN'S patience marvellous. Temper imper-
turbable. Irish Members shout and jeer, and make
melancholy imitation of laughter.
"' Pot-house Party' better name for them than' Par-
nellites,'" says HAHCOUB.T. "PABNELL at least knows
and observes the ordinary manner of a gentleman."
It was this booing and bellowing that used to drive
KonsT KK off his balance, and deliver him up to the enemy.
TBEVELYAH takes no notice. Answers question, and
sits down.
"Difference between FOBSTEB'S way of dealing with
Irish Members and TBEVELYAN'S," says Mr. GiBsoir,
"is that FORSTEE came to his work with assumption
that Irish Members had no right to question Chief
Secretary. TEEVELYAN graciously and abundantly con-
cedes right, and answers the most ridiculous and insolent
question in matter-of-fact, official, and always courteous
manner. I believe if HAEETNGTON, KENNY, or SMALL
were to ask him, 'How many are twice two r' he would
simply answer,' Four.' That's where he has 'em. They
chiefly want to advertise themselves in Ireland; and the
cheapest and surest way is to have a row with Chief
Secretary. But when TREVELYAN takes their question
seriously, and answers it fully, they can do nothing but
bellow, and they know that won't recommend them to
their constituents, who feel that the lowest amongst
them could do it as well."

FREE-(AND-EASY)-DOM AT DRURY LANE.
THERE have been so many disputes about recent events in Egypt,
that it must be a matter of satisfaction to the Student of History to
learn that Mr. AUGUSTUS HARRIS, in conjunction with Mr. G. F.
Rows, have settled the matter between them. We have the authority
of Lord WOLSELET of Cairojand other talented persons for believing
that the pictures of
battles presented to us
a few months ago by
the first - named of
these Gentlemen, in a
drama called Youth,
were absolutely start-
ling from their reality,
and anyone who ever
saw Mr. RYDER in the
character of a retired
Ecclesiastical Masher,
in the piece in which
those pictures ap-
peared, must have
shared the expressed
opinion of the Rev.
Mr. PENOTJTGTON, and
the (no doubt) secret
conviction of the Arch-
bishopof CANTERBURY,
that Mr. HARRIS knew
the Clergy and their characteristics — to put it colloquially —
down to the ground. With such a guide, then, as the Lessee of the
National Theatre to conduct us, we cannot do better than take
the "children home for their holidays" to Drury Lane, to brush
up their knowledge of Modern Egyptian History.
The First Act of Freedom is introductory. We are in a bazaar,
where Eastern Merchants are busily engaged in the rather fruitless
labour of folding and unfolding a strip of carpet, while native
women cany, on their heads, jars, at an angle conclusively proving
them (the jars and their heads) to be empty. Then we are told by
a retail slave-dealer, who, although Egyptian by birth and in
appearance, is" unquestionably Whitechapel by education, that a
certain, or rather uncertain Araf Bey is in love with the daughter
of a local British Banker, Miss Constance Loring, the betrothed of
one of the noblest, the most talkative, the most energetic, the most
patriotic and the bravest of men, Captain Oascoigne, JR.N. When
it is added that this hero of superlatives is also one of the portliest
of Naval Officers, it may be readily and accuratelv imagined that the
part is thoroughly well filled by Mr. AUGUSTUS HARRIS. But Araf
Bey has a better half, a sort of Egyptian Mrs. Caudle, who deter-
mines to thwart his plans, and it is ultimately this tartly-talkative
Lady who kindly kills him off in the middle of the Third Act, when
his presence in the Drama is apparently a cause of some embarrass-
ment to the joint Authors of the piece. Araf Bey explains to those
who it may and may not concern his desires, and then leaves the
Stage clear for the exhausting antics of a Lady of title, her daughter,
A Substantial Shelter. The Captain and the
Captives.

The Harlequinade-Quartette; or, Rehearsing for Boxing-Day.
a Yankee, and a Dutch Courier, whose characteristics are almost
identical with these of Clown, Columbine, Harlequin, and Pantaloon.
When this would-be merry harlequinade-quartette have done a
little easy tumbling, the English Banker, in the person of that fine
old representative of the worst types of Dramatic Villainy, Mr. E. F.
Eixi.ut, is introduced with his daughter to assist at the grand
entrance of stalwart Captain Oascoigne Harris and his equally
stalwart crew." Captain HARRIS is also accompanied by a number of
female slaves, varying in age from early childhood to extreme
maturity, and wearing rags peculiar to the land of the Nile and
also to the Emerald Isle. These slaves fondle his knees, evi-
dently regarding him as a substantial shelter. He makes many
patriotic speeches, which would be more effective if the Yankee
member of the harlequinade-quartette refrained from capping them.
The reason this individual does not refrain is the more easily under-
stood when it is remembered that the representative of the Yankee
is. Mr. G. F.'RowE, one of the Authors of the piece. Captain Oas-
coigne Harris has not only secured the more and less attractive
Irish-Egyptian females, 'but also their master, a wholesale slave-
dealer. This vindictive person (for he is very vindictive) has been
covered with chains by the Captain's command. And here we have
a glimpse at history. The English Naval Officer appeals to the
British Consul to imprison the wholesale slave-trader, and, at the
instance of Araf Bey, his request is refused. Whereupon the
Captain vigorously upbraids the Consul in clap-trap artfully con-
trived to snare applause, and then with his dozen portly maru^rs
crosses bayonets with the Egyptian troops. Imposing tableau, and
first escape of the hero of the piece from instantaneous death.
In Act Two the forgiving Captain has made it up with the timorous
Consul, who is, in fact, conducting the marriage of the emotional

Strange Proceedings at an English Wedding in Egypt. "Nautchy," but nice.
Naval Officer with the Banker's daughter. The Consul has thought-
fully engaged a ballet to entertain the wedding-guests, who, as the
whole of the court-yard is occupied by the dancing, watch the
movements of the nautch-girls from some flights of steps. The
bride is very properly seated in the place of honour under an
umbrella. Captain Gascoime Harris and his fat lads enter, the
latter bearing bouquets. There is no chaplain _ apparently to be
obtained for love or money, so the Naval Officer marries his bride off-
hand, or rather on hand, by placing a ring upon her finger. Then
the Egyptian Mrs. Caudle enters in a gorgeous sedan-chair, bringing
a splendid wedding-present from Araf Bey. Then, somehow or
other, an emeute takes place, and the bride is sent away in the gor-
geous sedan-chair. Then the British Banker appeals to the mob,
and being, no doubt, recognised by them, in spite of his respectable
disguise, as Mr. E. F. EDGAR, a Veteran Theatrical Ruffian profes-
sionally conversant with Stage Vice in all its branches, is, not
unnaturally, immediately
shot. Then Captain HAR-
RIS is patriotic about the
British Flag. Then there . 4]
is a great deal of firing on
both sides. The , Egyp-
tians swarm over the
walls—imposing tableau
—and second escape of
the hero of the piece from
instantaneous death.
In Act Three Constance
has fallen into the power
of Araf Bey, but is saved
by the Egyptian Mrs.
Caudle, who rescues her.
Her lover, -however, is-
seized by some comic
assassins, who, earlier in
the piece, have assisted

METROPOLITAN PRIZE PUZZLES. No. 7.
To KNOW THE RIGHT TIME AT WATERLOO STATION.
In the Last Act, poor Captain Oascoignc Harris has been terribly
bullied by the wholesale slave-dealer. He has aged materially, now
looking about fifty. He is clothed in rags, and is rendered some-
what grotesque by being tied to a dromedary. When he com-
plains of thirst, his merciless master shows him water, and then,
with a cry of "No, you don't!" spills it in the sand. In fact, the
unhappy Naval Officer is the subject of a number of cruel and
even rather vulgar practical jokes. In the nick of time, however,
a British gunboat comes at the rate of about two hundred knots
an hour up a canal which flows conveniently beside the Pyramids,
and " brings to " in front of the wholesale dealer's encampment. It
is unnecessary to state that the hero aad heroine are immediately
united, the wholesale slave-dealer suppressed, the harlequinade-
quartette rendered happy, and the connc murderers provided for.
When all this has been done, the vessel fires a heavy gun appa-
rently point blank at the Captain himself! Imposing'tableau, and
last escape of the hero of the piece from instantaneous death.
So much for Freedom from one point of view. Its chief charac-
teristic is a certain laisscz alter—a free and easy manner, noticeable
in its construction. However, it would be unjust not to praise the
Stage Management, the Scenery, and, in the cases of Messrs. HAEBIS
ana FEMKA>TDEZ. and Misses SOPHIE EYIUE, FOOTE, and BBOMLEY,
the Acting. Taken as a whole, the play is good. But taken as a

hinch from the strait line of time-onered custom, but sets such a
egsample of igh-minded forgiving horsepitality as praps the world
has hardly never seen.
And so it was at the gorgeous Bankwet on Wensday last.
I couldn't restrain my natral curiosity to see how " my rite hon-
nerabel frend the LORD MAKE," as the Aldermen allers speaks of him,
would receive the Hed of the Government as is pledged to their
destrucshun: so. when I heard him enounced, I peeped out of the

at 'em. Ah, the site as I took at 'em was a site indeed!
It was a trying moment for both those elustrious men, and, as they
drew near, as the poet says, "the boldest took his breath for a
time"! There was a sort of half-and-half smile on both their
wisages, but it was about as reel as the shake hands before the fight
between the Game Chicken and the Artful Dodger. Both tried their
best to look easy and dignifide, but ony one succeeded, need I say
witch? There was a on rm look of quiet satisfacshun with things in
gineral, about the LORD MARE, that fairly puzzled his would-be
Destroyer, and I noticed arterwards, when I handed him his favrite
dish of stewed Tung with Salary Sauce, he looked at me with quite

That you '11 remember me!
To wliich may be added the following final verse,
that might be sung by the rest of the company during
the voyage in half a gale of wind:—
When Yankee talent fumes and frets,
And London yawns and stares
To find, instead of HENRY'S " sets,"
But flats, with painted chairs!
When 'mid Atlantic's " Much Ado"
We 're hopelessly at sea,—
And far too ill to think of you—
P'raps you '11 remember we!
THI-: BARE TRUTH.—A truth announced in a somewhat
remarkable notification:—" J\Wa Veritas restores grey
hair to its original shade." Does it. Nvda Veritas. as
to hair may be supposed to signify baldness. In order,
then, to be effectually applied as a restorative of grey
hair, does it require the head to be shaved first?

aeceps1 their generas inwitation to dinner, no sooner sets his two
estonished eyes on JOHN TENNTBL'S highly flattering Cartoon, than,
instead of jming all the rest of the world in their harty laugh, as
every wise and senserble feller would, he sends off to the Mansion
House to say that he has just thort of a werry speshal engagement,
and can't come! And it is wispered as how he has follard it up by
ordering no more Punches to be brort into his sollem manshun. Poor
Sir WILLIAM! He fust loses his temper, and then loses his dinner.
The Bankwet was upon tho hole p'raps the most suceessfullest as
was ever given in that nobel All of Horspitality. I missed the long
row of Royal Attendants with their lovely gold bullyem epperlets,
as we has when we has lots of Princes, but even this was partly pur-
wided by the wonderful amount of what the French call cheek " of
his grace the Dook of WESTMINSTER. Wishing ewedently to give a
sort of sample of how he means to cum out when he is elected
LORD MAiE of New London—long be the day !—he had acshally
asked for the loan of two of Her Majesty's Royal Footmen, and there
they was not only standing behind his cheer but acshally condy-
sending to wait upon him and his beautiful Dutchess! However the
LORD MARE as usual was quite equal to the occasion, and hordered
up his Coachman and Postillion to stand behind him, who, tho' they
wasn't of much use and got a good deal in everybody's way, made a
werry respectful show for our stable old Institution.
.Nearly all the Ministers of any importance was there. The lowly
minded Gent from Brummagem didn't put in an appearance, being
probberbly engaged in toiling or spinning, or some such low ocyou-
payshun, but that didn't seem to spUe nobody's appetite, and the
absense of the Senior Member for Chelsea, harcaaes hambone, &»
BROWN said, which I bleeves is sarcastic French for " a nice pair!"
was endured without a murmer. It is said his Republican instinks
is shocked at the sight of so many Livery-men.
The LORD MARE of course made the speech of the evening. In f ac
he didn't leave much for the Magnificent Elderly Gentleman to say,
but nevertheless, he made a grand speech, and wound up with words
ef hope for all on us, as would have cut Sir WiLLiAif s hard hart
to the werry core.
Next in importance to the speeches of the LORD MART; and of Mr.
GLADSTONE was the Speech of Lord DARBY, tho' it was about the
shortest, and why? because he rewealed one of the profoundeat and
importantest Cabinet secrets as ever was diwulged even after dinner.
In Wino Werytas, as BROWN said, which means, I believe, that
"good wine needs no gooseberry-bush." in witch I quite agrees.
Lord DARBY acshally said that wen they are about to appoint a
Embassador, or Governor, or a Secretary of State, the first question
they asks is, not wot brains has he got. not what egsperience has he
got, not what nolledge of the Vrorld has he got, but, what sort of
Wife has he got?
Ah! my Lord DARBY, no wunder you 're such a favrite with the
fair sects! A sweeter complement or more hellegantly put was
never paid 'em since our werry great granfather gammoned EVE.
I wunder what the Government will do for to shew their gratitood
to the LORD MARE. They can't make him a Knight as he is one
every day, and they can't very well make him a Barren-Knight as
he has got a werry numerus number of offsprings all ready, so p'raps
it will be a Wicount, like Lord MATCHBOX SNEERBOOK, who was
present.
I 'm amost afeard as he spoke out too strongly for his own interests,
both BROWN and me we both thort so, and. so did His Lordship's
Postillion. He's a man of werry few words, of course, being a
Postillion, hut he thinks a lot, as he's plenty of time to do, and wot
he says he means, and what he did say was, "I thinks as if his
Lordship had rid 'em a little more with the snaffle, and not quite
so much with the curb, they might have jogged on together pretty
cumferal for some time longer." But when his public dooty stands
in one pair of scales and his privet interest in the other. I knows
from a long egsperience which will have to go to the wall.

A BUST scene, I must confess,
The Continental Mail Express!
The babbling of boys and porters,
The shouting of the luggage-sorters.
Indeed a vast and varied sight,
Beneath the pale electric light;
The roll of trucks, the noise, the hustle,
The bawling " Bjr yer leave!" and bustle.
While anxious tourists blame and bless
The Continental Mail Express!
Though wanting minutes ten to Eight,
Still people hurry through the gate:
N»w London's dull, the Season over,
They flit from Charing Cross to Dover;
They take their tickets, pay their fare,
They 're booked right through to everywhere!
To lead a life of hopeless worry.
With Bradshaw, Baedeker, and Murray.
And yet they hail with eagerness
The_Continental Mail Express!
I think of toil by rail and boat,
And cackle at the table d'hote:
Of coin of somewhat doubtful mintage,
And wine of very gruesome vintage;.
Of passes steep that try the lungs,
And chattering in unknown tongues.
Of Rhenish hills, Italian fountains,
Of forests dark, and snowy mountains
To startt I 'd give all I possess,
By Continental Mail Express!
'Tis Eight o'clock, save minutes two—
Here comes a stout, fur-capped Mossoo;
He's in a fluster at the wicket
Because he cannot find his ticket;
And over there may be espied
A pretty little two days' bride.
How bored she '11 be with six weeks' spooning,
How wearied with the honeymooning f
Yet lots go, leaving no address,
By Continental Mail Express!
Eight-five! The lading is complete,
The last arrival in his seat;
The porters' labour's almost ended,
The latest evening paper vended.
We wish departing fnends " Good night!"
A whistle blows, the Guard says " Right!"
We watch the red-light's coruscation,
Then slowly, sadly, leave the station.
All London's gone, say more or less,
By Continental Mail Express!

CHILDE CHAPPIE'S PILGRIMAGE.
CANTO THE SECOND.
COME, blue-eyed maid of heaven!—but thou, alas!
Art little like this epos to inspire.
Goddess of Wisdom! Were the
Golden Ass
A hopeful subject to arouse thy fire?
The Gilded Youth for whom I wake
the lyre
Would deem thy wisdom owlish,
tedious, slow,
The leaden sceptre and dominion dire
Of Boredom dread in thine Olympian
glow,
Thy grave broad brow, and strait-
laced breast of virgin snow.
IT.
But where's Childe CHAPPIE? I
must not forget
To track that dawdling pilgrim.
Vestured brave
In sheeny hat, and collar'closely set,
Snowy as ever laundry-maid did lave
Or deft," clear-starchcr" stiffen, see
him wave
A morniug greeting to his comrades dear,
Chanting the Comic Opera's latest stave
In husky tones he vainly strives to clear
With deep astringent draughts of foaming Bitter Beer.
m.
The night's hot fever yet his pulses feel.
He hath " a head," and nodding to his friend
Makes the brain whirl like the revolving wheel
Of hurrying Hansom, and his back to bend,
To fliok a dust-fleck from his bright boot-end,
Brings feelings scarce of comfort or of joy.
Alas! why did they liquors wildly blend?
What mav they quaff this nausea to destroy!
Shall it be fi.-and-S. or bumpers of the "Boy "?

At least they will not miss ACBARIA'S wiles,
ACRASIA brassy-tressed, with bistre deep
Eye-ringed, who at yon counter stands and smiles,
The bar's blonde siren, to whose haunt fools creep,
And o'er her calculated witcheries keep
A jealous watch, as with her Lamia jjlide
She hands the boys, their sapless brains to steep,
Potations; they self-deemed astute and " snide,"
Of nous bereft, low chaff the bar-queen golden dyed.
v.
Her reign is brief, soon are her glories gone;
But London's Lamia hath full many a lair.
Comus at every bar erects a throne.
And each may find a newer Circe there.
Crass CHAPPIE! could another ever share
That shrewd and callous heart it were not thine.
Dolls of the trim-drawn tie and sleek-smoothed hair
In dozens daily bow at that coarse, shrine,
Each deeming to his suit her favouring eyes incline.

Away! nor let me loiter in my song,
CHAPPIE hath many a pathway yet to tread.
To Waterloo they swiftly bowl along.

With hopes Utopian circling in each head,
Of "tips" and morals." With such lure= -*.* ^.^^^

SEA-SIDE PUZZLE.
To FIND YOUK BATHING-MACHINE IF YOU 'VE FORGOTTEN THE NUMBER.
SHALL DOBBS HAVE A STATUE?
"WHO on earth is DOBBS?" asks JOITES of Cheapside. as he hur-
riedly gobbles down his elegant breakfast at hia suburban villa at
select Surbiton, fearing to lose his train. "We will tell JONES, and
the rest of the world at the snrae time, and then we will discuss the
question with which we began.
Mr. ARCHIBALD DOBBS, then, is a gentleman of remarkable energy,
courage, and public spirit, as will be readily acknowledged when we
inform the world of London what he has done for them. Being dis-
satisfied, as most of us are, with the price charged for the supply of
water, he appealed to the Magistrate, contending' the charge should
be based upon the rateable value of his house, and not upon its gross
value, but the Magistrate decided against him. Not having a very
high opinion of the legal attainments of a Police Magistrate, he
boldly appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench, and they decided that
the Magistrate was wrong, and Mr. DOBBS right. The Water Com-
pany, well knowing the importance of this decision, immediately
gave notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal. Matters now began to
look serious. However public-spirited a man may be, the fighting
at law of a wealthy public Company is no joke. So Mr. DOBBS
appealed to the Pubbc to assist him. But the Public is a very curious
body in relation to such matters; and while they readily follow a
Royal lead anywhere, or for any object, are very slow in assisting a
man in fighting their battles, and, with the exception of some assist-
ance from the Corporation and from one or two of the Vestries, thn
response was but small. When the appeal came on before Lord
COLERIDGE and two other eminent Judges, the decision of the
Queen's Bench Division was over-ruled, and Mr. DOBBS declared
to be in the wrong.
Some men never know when they are beaten, and, fortunately for
all of us, Mr. DOBBS is one of them. So he boldly appealed to the
House of Lords, and they have decided, unanimously, that the
Police Magistrate was wrong, that Lord COLERIDGE and the two
Loids Justices were even more wrong, for they ought to have known
better, and that gallant Mr. DOBBS is right.
Now, let us see what the result will probably be. As their decision
will reduce the power of the Water Companies to charge us for water
by about one-sixth, the saving to the Metropolis by this plucky pro-
ceeding will be about £150.000 a year. Now for the question with
which we began. Shall DOBBS have a Statue? Certainly not; it
might be as nideous an abortion as that just removed from Hyde
Park Corner; but surely some means can be devised by which the
Public might show their appreciation of good judgment and great
pluck combined for their interest. In one large City house, of
exceptionally high rental, where the consumption of water is but
small, it is calculated that they could lay in as much beer as they
consume water, and at less expense. Mr. DOBBS has begun a great
work with conspicuous success, and if his effort be properly appre-
ciated, others will be induced to continue it, until the giant water-
monopolists be brought to reasonable terms.
THE PEERS TO THE PBiJIIER.
IT 's truly disgusting! You give us no work
Till too late at the table to be a beginner.
Pray what is the use of a good knife and fork
You can't use till the end of the dinner?
THE PREMIER TO THE PEERS.
You swear your light labours your zeal disappoint?
As Political Cooks you our toils would be halving?
Go to! If the times are so much out of joint.
'Tis because of your " cutting and carving"!
MRS. RAMSBOTHAM cannot exist without her fashionable and Court
Intelligence. Miss LAVINIA commenced reading aloud a paragraph
from Truth, "The QUEEN has also commissioned the Duke to invest
his father-in-law—" when she was interrupted by her Aunt exclaim-
ing, "Good gracious! LAVINIA! What on earth could he be invested
in? But go on, my dear; I am most anxious to know who was the
broker, as I should like to go to him myself."

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FBOM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night,
August 13.—Donnybrook Fair in House to-
night. "But," as O'SHEA says, regret-
fully, "Donnybrook under disadvantages.
Been raining all night; slush up to your
ankles, and the whiskey bad."
Whole thing had too much air of pre-
arranged performance. Not been a lively
Session for Irish Members.
"We 've never been the same men," says
T. D. SULLIVAN, with a sigh, "since
FOHSTEH left us. He was the making of
us as a party. Always foresaw the conse-
quences. Told HEALT he was doing a bad
thing for Ireland—that is. for us—when
he and the rest combined to drive out
FORSTER."
What with that, and stoppage of American
funds, things gone hard with the patriots.
Felt necessity of having at least one good
burst before Session closed. The nearer
the end the more useful the effect. Govern-
ment obligingly assented. Irish votes post-
poned from week to week till to-night, when,
after due notice, they are moved. Large
muster of Irish Members. Severe competi-
tion for Grand Prix, to be won by Member
who can heap on absent men the coarsest
abuse without being suspended. HEALY
very good. HARRINGTON a poor creature,
making: shrill echoes of HEALY'S invective.
The O'KELLY moderately explosive 0' BHD:N
intense, not to say too-too. T. P. CONNOK

highly-strung temperament of Mr. CALLAN

Business done.—Some Irish Votes passed.
Tuesday.—Quite affecting scene in House

and nail in Grand Committee, feels necessity
of coming down gently.

Mr. S. (Reformed Burglar and Banner-Bearer in the same). "An! AND HOW 'ANDY THEM
LITTLE BAL-CO-NIES WOULD 'A' BEEN IN FORMER"
\_A warning flourish on the Concertina, and Mr. S. drops the subject!
excellence was acknowledged from Conservative Benches, "nothing to this. Does anybody
know where I could find a cockatrice's den? Should like to go and put my hand in it."
"Better try your foot," says ATTORNEY-GENERAL. "More accustomed to putting that in."
"Tell you what, young fellows," HARTINGTON says from under the brim ot liis hat,
"CHAMBERLAIN'S done"more than saved the Bankruptcy Bill. He's saved Grand Committees.
If his Committee had not done more than yours, JAMES, we should never have dared to propose
renewal of experiment."
Sir WILLIAM MCARTHUH wanted to ask " How about Madagascar?" HENRY, desirous of
changing the subject, proposes to ask the worthy Alderman " How about Lambeth?" Not
sure, however, that he 'd make much of the question. Few scenes of equal interest to that

witnessed in one of the Committee Rooms the other day, when
Sir WILLIAM received visit from large body of his Constituents.
Hadn't called to ask him to sit for his portrait, or to receive piece of
plate, or even to invite him to dinner. Simply looked in to ask him
to resign his seat.
"Can't imagine," says Mr. WOODALL, "anything more uncom-
fortable or more embarrassing than to be shut up in Committee Room
with twenty or thirty of your Constituents, who insist upon your
resigning."
But Sir WILLIAM equal to occasion. Nothing could exceed urbanity
with which he beamed upon them through his spectacles, or the
personal interest with which he turned from one speaker to the other,
anxious not to lose a single word of so interesting a conversation.
When all had finished, Sir WILLIAM, leaning gracefully upon his
gingham umbrella, blandly explained that, whilst anxious not to
oifend anyone's prejudices, he really could not, in the interests of the
vast electorate of Lambeth, yield to the sobcitation of deputation.
No anger; no resentment; no scornful words; only the bland smile,
the benevolent presence, and the gingham umbrella persuasively
pointed to the door through which the deputation presently filed,
agreeing that they hadn't made much out of the visit.
Business done.—Tremendous. Irish Parliamentary Registration
Bill passed through Committee, Bankruptcy Bill finally disposed of,
and Irish Tramways Bill read Second Time.
Wednesday Afternoon. — " AGNEW doesn't speak often," Lord
HARTINGTON said just now; "fpr, like myself and other Lancashire
Members, he feels responsibility attaching to our position. As
SHAKSPEARE says, 'What Lancashire says to-day, England thinks
to-morrow.' So, except at Salford, Lancashire chary of speech.
But when AGNEW opens his mouth he says something. Only wish
he 'd opened it sooner on this particular point."
These remarks, somewhat extended for HARTINGTON, refer to brief
address by AQNEW on question of WARTON'S Wednesdays. WAHTON
always comes down at noon on Wednesday with fresh supply of
snuff, strongly suspected of being medicated. Members about to
enter House find him there. He offers snuff. The unwary take it,
become violently agitated, and, instead of following original inten-
tion .of entering House, retire. Come round in from half-an-hour to
an hour, according to strength of constitution. But in meantime
SPEAKER been waiting for House to be made, and legislative
machinerv at a stand-still. Members begin to tight shy of snuff of
late, so WAHTON bodily blocks the way. Tries to prevent them
entering. AGNEW brings this under notice of SPEAKER, who utters
grave rebuke, and WAHTON temporarily snuffed out.
Business done.—Scotch Local Government Board Bill in Committee.
Thursday.—Distinguished visitor at House at night. Mr. MAR-
WOOD, having prof essional eneagementat Newgate on Monday, runs up
to town a day or two before. Where shall he go? Madame TCSSAUD'S,
the Tower, or Houses of Parliament ? _ TUSSAUD'S a little melancholy
with its chamber of departed acquaintances. The Tower a place
where, Mr. MARWOOD has heard, in the Dark Ages they used to get
rid of surplus population by taking off their heads with axe. That's
low. Mr. MARWOOD will not countenance it even at this date.
"Shall call on my friend the 'OME SECKRERARY at the 'Ouses of
Parlyment," he says.
Sir WILLIAM unhappily not at home when his colleague in the
Executive Government called. Fact is, had been rather let down at
question time by so inconsiderable a person as HARRINGTON. Having
to answer question about dog-fight at Blackburn, Grandiose Old Man
naturally not content with ordinary reply. Couldn't resist chance of
"going for " the newspapers, which, I am told, don't habitually esti-
mate him at his own value. "When gentlemen read these accounts
in the newspapers," says he, with a comprehensive wave of his arm,
"it will save time and trouble if they assume they are not true."
"Does the same principle apply to information given in American
newspapers ?'' HARRINGTON asked. House, recalling familiar spectacle
of last year, when Grandiose Old Man was constantly appearing and
reading in sepulchral tones extracts from American newspapers de-
scribing the doings of the Land League, laughs and cheers. G. 0. M.
doesn't like being laughed at, so goes home, and thus misses oppor-
tunity of showing Mr. MARWOOD over the House.
In his absence distinguished Hanger-on of the Government does
very well. A nice, quiet, mild, elderly Gentleman, of affable
manners, and even benevolent countenance. Peers came to peer at
him through glass door of Strangers' Gallery.
"Wears a high black stock like me!" cnes Lord WAVENEY, with
a look of terror coming into his eves.
Held quite a levee in Lobby of House of Commons, but is not at all
stuck up. Listened with decent politeness to Lord WEMYSS, making
thirteenth speech on Agricultural Holdings Bill.
"Now he uses the long drop in his speech, if I may say so,"
Mr. M. observed, patronismgly. Whether this professional remark
alluded to length of address, or to neatness in despatching subject,
left problematical.
After visiting Lords, Mr. MARWOOD not at all above looking in on
Commons. Sat for an hour in Speaker's Gallery. Most of the time
had his eyes fixed on Benches below Gangway on Conservative side,
where there was a large muster of Irish Members.
"What are you thinking about, Mr. MARWOOD?" I ask, observing
his concentrated attention. (No hang-dog look about him. Not
a bit afraid of talking to him).
"Ah!" he said, slowly rubbing his hands together, drawing in
his breath, and emitting it with kind of hungry sigh. Curious
person to talk to. Mysterious and monosyllabic.
Business done.—Mr. HEALY paid off Sub-Inspector CAMERON for
endeavouring to keep the peace at Wexford. Sat late, and got some
Votes.
Friday.—Curious instance supplied in House of Lords to-night of
power of phrase. Cruelty to Animals Bill passed in Commons b v over-
whelming majority. Getting on very well in the Lords till WEMYSS,
making twentv-third speech for the week, severely denounced it as
"a germ Bill/' "What's a germ Bill?" Lord DENMAN whispered.
"Don't know," WEMYSS replied. "But it sounds well." Lords
didn't know either. But felt there was something darkly mysterious
about a germ Bill. Had heardof ".germ theory." Distinctly-improper
thing. Might have something to do with that; so throw out Bill
by 30 Votes to 17.

WITH what an air of annoyance and reckless contempt one fellow-
passenger always treats another fellow-passenger's bag!
Every man thinks that the whole carriage belongs to him, and
looks upon every other person as a trespasser and a nuisance.
Awaking, or partially awaking, about 4'30 A.M. on a lovely morn-
ing, I am informed, by a Guard or Porter, that we are stopping at a
place called Penrith. This name having a decidedly Welsn sound,
it occurs to me suddenly that, in spite of all my precautions at start-
ing' (when, to begin with, the Station-Master's clerk, confidentially,
and as a great piece of politeness, put me into the wrong carriage,
from which the Guard forcibly rescued me, thereby earning my
gratitude and a couple of shillings), I have either made a mistake in
the train, or that that part of it, in which I ought to have been, has
gone on to my intended destination, and another part, with me in it, has
turned up in Wales, where, as it seems to me, we are at this moment,
when we should be in Scotland, or, at all events, at Carlisle.
There is onlylone supposition, inadmissible in all railway travelling,
and that is, that the driver doesn't know his way, or nas taken a
wrong turning in the dark, and lost it. A stage-coach, handled by a
coachman new to the road, mig^ht do this, but an engine-driver can't.
We, my travelling companion and myself, examine Bradshaw.
This process is always accompanied by a series of impatient exclama-
tions varying in their intensity according to the difficulty of the
inquiry. I cannot at a moment's notice define the precise meaning of
"objurgations,"—but as, in the course of pur Bradshaw Inquiry, we
do not use very strong language, I am inclined to the opinion that, in
this case, we use "objurgations," and while we are about it we
objurgate freely. If objurgation doesn't mean this, it is such an
ugly word in itself that it ought to. The result is that we find
Penrith in something under ten minutes.
Being perfectly satisfied that we are on the right route, my com-
panion, who has kindly undertaken the inquiry, throws down the
Railway Guide-Book with a "Confound Bradshaw.'" and reclines,
with an air of utter exhaustion, at full length, on the seat. Certainly,
the study of Bradshaw at 4 A.M., after a series of short snoozes,—
say, as far as I am concerned, twenty spasmodic attempts at sleep, to
be calculated at forty winks each,—is certainly very trying. My
companion, who, like myself, is to be a guest on board our friend
MELLEVILLE'S yacht, and with whom I have a slight previous
acquaintance, has commenced the journey by saying that "he never
can sleep in a train, and hoping that, if I do, I won't snore." I assure
him, of course, that I am never guilty of snoring, and should have
prepared myself for a chat, with our cigar, had not my e_xperience
told me, with certainty, that, whenever a man begins by informing
me how he finds it impossible ever to sleep in a train, he is sure
to snuggle himself into a comfortable corner, gradually become
huddled up all in a heap, so that at last he resembles a badly-stuffed
dummy waiting to be carried about on the fifth of November, the
only indication of life being a persistent snore, which slowly increases
in tone, until the noise, having prevented anyone else from getting a
wink of sleep, suddenly reaches such a pitch of intensity as to wake
the performer himself, who, however, merely gives a discontented
shrug, huddles himself up again into another helpless attitude, and in
less than a minute is again sound asleep, and bringing out the
second series of his hijrhly unpopular •inorinai-pntprtniiim"nt. Wb»n

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
he wakes for good, hours afterwards, he at once complains of the
impossibility of petting to sleep when you (his unfortunately wakeful
and long-suffering companion) "will make such a confounded noise
with your snoring." My companion is no exception to this rule, and
so I try to get to sleep nrst; but 1 make a false start, and he wins
by three snores to nothing.
At Carlisle, being late,—it is rarely my good fortune to travel by a
train that keeps to its time,—we have only an eight minutes' wait.
Everything in the way of refreshment is at the other end of the
platform, a distance apparently of a quarter of a mile.
Awaking to this fact, we run.
Much can be done in eight minutes, but not everything when you
have a considerable way to go there and back, when you are strange
to the place, when you are on the alert to catch the slightest indica-
tion of a whistle or a bell, when you ore immediately prepared to
drop your hot coffee, cram your bread-and-butter in your mouth,
chuck down any coin that comes first to hand without waiting for
change, or, if engaged in a refreshing toilette, you will throw down
the brush, put your travelling-cap on anyhow (deranjring your hair
again), hustle on your eoat, nearly assault the attendant who is
civilly coming at you with a clothes-brush, but give him sixpence,
and then, feeling as if you had brushed your hair the wrong way, ana
were dressed in somebody else's clothes, you run down the platform,
the train having moved farther off than before, and anxiously visit
every carriage, until, just as you are in utter despair of finding the
right one, you see a friendly porter halloaing to you from afar off,
or your travelling, companion (though he is the very lost person to
afford you any assistance, having generally gone wrong himself,
or, if right, having re-settled himself comfortably, and probably
wondering what on earth can have become of you) signalling to you
wildly to " oome on," as if he were challenging you to a combat of
two,. By'the way, apropos of "challenging, I do notice this in
my travelling companion, that when he is awake there is a certain
asperity in his manner as if he wanted to have a row with me.
Seeing this, I prepare soft answers, and avoid any topics likely to
lead to difference of opinion. In fact, not being at all certain of
my man, I humour him on every point. "Birds in their little nests
agree," savs the poet, with remarkable poetic licence by the way,
and two fellow-travellers in the same compartment ought to be
unanimous. Happy Thought.—Be unanimous.
The consequence is that my companion appears to be better pleased,
with himself, at all events, if not with me, and when once across the
Border, we begin—I start it and he follows suit—with that fevered
and unnatural jocosity that will exhibit itself at five A.M.—when you
ought to be asleep, but can't—to attempt imitations of the Scotch
brogue. We don t get much further than pointing out a labourer
in the fields—(healthy work a labourer's in the fields at five A.M.—
what's he doing ?—probably like the early bird, catching the worm—
or, still more probably, catching the early bird itself)—and saying,
"Eh, Sirs, there'» a mon!" or " There's a wee bit lassie!" and we
talk of a " drappit in the ee," but we don't risk taking it at five A.M.
With the same forced gaiety we playfully point out to one another
several Abbotsfords, a variety of imaginary birth-places of ROIIEUT
BRUCE: of course we select a pig-stye, and ask "who was born
there? the answer being " HOGG ;" and then we indicate several
BURKS' Monuments, and some hives as the place where the Bawbees
dwell; and then we_ inform each other (for les grands esprits, &c.)
that a lot of natives in a field are Scots wha hay-making.
After these feeble specimens of early wit and humour, the con-
versation becomes desultory; then we sleep alternately, each waking
up by turn fresh for a talk, only to find the other asleep, and to be
annoyed with him. Gradually we feel the pangs of hunger.
Then the train begins to dawdle. At the small stations they
appear so pleased to see a train that they cannot make up their
minds to part with it. Guard, Station-master, jx>rters, all chatting
pleasantly for awhile, and then dashing into business. The business
seems generally to be suggested by the head official being suddenly
struck by the idea that, as the visits of a train are fewond far between,
our engine, on the present occasion, may as well be utilised for the
moving of a few coal-trucks. More delay. We seem to have got into
a line of McDawdles.
To give some sort of colour to the protracted stoppages, someone (if
possible, in an official uniform, but anybody will do) opens the door,
and requests to see the tickets. This process is repeated-^-sometimes
twice over, by mistake, at the same station—once within every
twenty minutes. At last a porter opens the door, and asks if we '11
have breakfast on board the steamer (an hour hence), because, if so,
he '11 wire on. We hesitate. At least I do; for, collapsing as I now
am with hunger, I feel, from painful experience, that to order a
breakfast beforehand on board a steamer which has to cross the sea
to Ireland, may end in bitter disappointment, and be a waste of
money. This last reason I think arises from the atmosphere of _the
country; I am becoming acclimatized, and the first symptom is a
partial exhibition of Scotch caution.
It is very fine; it is warm, scarcely a breath of air to move the
trees; but, as I point out to my travelling companion, we are not
going to have much to do with trees, and appearances inland are but
very untrustworthy authority as to the real state of the case on the
coast and on the sea,—and so, my companion being evidently of a
hasty temperament, and the porter on the doorstep appearing im-
patient, the former decides, autocratically, "Wire breakfast for two
on board "—and I assent, hoping it will be for the best.
At Stranraer. On board the steamer in correspondence with
train.—a correspondence which, I am glad to say, is published in
Braathatc,—plying between Scotland and Ireland. It is for the best.
Excellent breakfast. First-rate fish, first-rate eggs, better toast was
never crunched, and better marmalade couldn't be found anywhere
in Scotland. Bravo, Steward and admirable Stewardess! The latter
when at work as stern as Lady Macbeth, and with a brogue that abso-
lutely so frightens me at first, that I refuse to let her take away my
cup to fill it with coffee and milk; but she insists, and I timidly yield,
and she returns with it, made exactly as I want it, real caff au luit.
On no passenger-boot that I can remember have I ever met with
such a possible breakfast. There is a choice of about half-a-dozen
things in fish and meat—for the small sum of two shillings a head,
cut and come again as often as you like. But to be just before I am
generous, nay, lavish, of praise. I should add that on no passenger-
boat do I ever remember myself being so well, with such an appetite
for breakfast, or (which is five points out of six in my favour) the
sea so culm. I am therefore viewing the commissariat department
under exceptionally favourable conditions.
One traveller, who looks like Rub Hoy 3facgregor badly dis-
guised in a modern tourist suit, goes through the whole course, for,
having to return to the saloon in the course of half-an-hour, 1
find him still at it in the most unabashed manner, evidently taking
out his railway and boat-fare in a supply which would serve for
three meals in one— tria juncta in uno—and last him the day.
The Stewardess, Steward, and their assistant regard one another in
an uncertain manner. He comes up on deck at last, but I don't
think they can have made much out of Mr. ROB HOY MACGRKGOR,
who, I should say. doesn't often get such a chance when his foot " is
on his native heath." By the way. why "foot"? Why not" feet"?
The MACGREOOR was not noted for generally standing on one leg
like the figure of Mercury! And, if both feet were not on his
"native heath," which one was? and where was the other?
Solution of Difficulty. If one of ROB ROT'S feet was in one county,
perhaps the other was in Ayr.
Ireland, bedod! Ould Ireland! Larne Harbour.
Happy Thought.—Arrange joke beforehand, to amuse them on the
yacht. My travelling-companion shall say, speaking of Larne, that
he " didn't know there was such a place. To which my replv will
be, "Indeed! Well, you see you've (rot to Larne," or " 1 always
said you had a good deal to Larne," or simply " Live and Larne."
On second thoughts, I won't take my travelling-companion into
partnership over this jeu de mot. From what I 've seen of him
when awake, I don't think he is the sort of man to be entrusted with
a part in a joke. I will perfect it before dinner-time, and bring it out
as an impromptu. This was SHERIDAN'S plan. History repeats
itself. That 'a why History is so dull.
Some of the Yacht's crew are on Larne quay, and in a twinkling
they have deposited our baggage in the gig, and in another few
twinklings we have greeted our host, MELLEVILLE, the owner of the
Creuta,—naturally, out unlearnedlv, pronounced "Crtiiter"—the
men "give way "-^{Happy Thought.—That's why a boat's crew
should be so obliging, because they 're always " giving way "]—and
we are now nearing the gallant schooner, Creusa.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SOMETHING LIKE A CIRCUIT.
THE arrangements for the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE'S "American
Tour," having, according to a Contemporary, at length been " sub-
stantially completed by the Committee, it is satisfactory to find that
the whole undertaking promises to prove a great financial success.
It has long, of course, been known in legal circles that the beggarly
pay received bv the leading lights of the Bench, when taken in com-
parison with the heavy sums made latterly bv their more fortunate
rivals of the Stage, had led to a tension of feeling on the subject that
could only find ultimate relief in some spirited outburst. And the
determined and business-like prominence of the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE
at a recent Banquet, showed clearly in which way the wind was
setting. It is therefore not a matter of surprise to hear that by the
engagement of an excellent man of business, Mr. ELLIOT F. SHEPARD,
Lord COLERIDGE, and the learned troupe who accompanv him, have
already managed before their arrival in the States, to fill up nearly
every one of their dates, down to the very day of their return voyage
home again across the Atlantic.
It is satisfactory, too, to note that, while business has evidently
been the guiding motive of all the arrangements, there will be no
lack of recreation for the hard-working luminaries en route. On
August 28 a certain " Mr. SLOANE " gives them a " reception," and
on the 29th it is announced that "Judge HILTON will entertain the
party." At Windsor, Vermont, they will, on the 1st of September,
be shown " Mr. EVARTS'S guests," no doubt a rare collection of per-
sonages, and well worth seeing. The very next dav. too, they will
be treated to a private view of "FABIAN'S Twin." All this is as it
should be. The unusual strain of an extended legal tour cannot be
lightened too much with pleasing little distractions of such a charac-
ter, and it is agreeable to note that even the claims of private friend-
ship will not be forgotten. "On Saturday, September 8," says the
Report, "the party will go to Fredericton, New Brunswick, where
Lord CoLKRiimi: will visit his old friend. Lord JOHN FREDERICTON,
the Bishop of Fredericton. New Brunswick."
Nor is the. Dominion behind-hand in graceful attentions to the
hard-working troupe. Receptions are offered them freely on all
sides. "At Quebec," the report proceeds, "they get a reception
and a dinner" This is handsome. At Montreal there is a recep-
tion, but no dinner. Ottawa also prefers to indicate its hearty
cordiality in the same unobtrusive fashion. There is hand-shaking,
but nothing more. But Lord Chief Justice COLERIDGE, Lord Justice
BOWEN, Mr. CHARLES RUSSELL, Q.C., and Mr. INCE, Q.C., and the
several other distinguished Members of the English Bar who make

tion of the dining element from the tariff of welcome set before them.
Even an injudicious sandwich or two might be too much for them,

will be requisite to enable them to get through it at all.
Still the programme, as far as can be gathered from the brief

MYSTERY, MURDER, AND THE MONEY MARKET.
(The fragment of a Story picked up in Capel Court.)
"The Madrid journals publish particulars of the Boune gambling con-
nected with the recent conspiracy. More revelations are promised when the
censorship of the Press has been abolished."—Daily Paper.
THE Prisoner, bound hand and foot, was yet able to crawl to a
window which separated his room from the next. He was surprised
to find that it was furnished more like a City office than what his
imagination had pictured to be the head-quarters of a Secret Society
ubiquitous in its ramifications. There were tables and chairs, a
desk with drawers, and an iron safe. In a corner was a strange-
looking little machine, under a glass case, from which continually
flowed a thin strip of paper, apparently covered with hieroglyphics.
A stern-countenanced but respectably-garbed individual of middle
age was seated at the desk, writing. After a while he stopped for a
moment, seemed to be thinking deeply, and then approached the thin
slip with its strange characters. What he reaa upon the paper
seemed to annoy him, for he stamped his foot impatiently, and
touched a button projecting from the wall. Immediately, a secret
door was discovered, which opened suddenly to admit a cloaked
figure. The man at the desk motioned to the new-comer to throw
on his disguise. The peremptory command was obeyed, and the
Prisoner uttered an exclamation of intense astonishment as he recog-
nised in the now undraped figure one of the most celebrated diplo-
matists of modern times. The man at the desk, holding the strip of
paper in his hand, appeared to be giving orders which were received
by his visitor with obsequious bows. Then the Statesman was
motioned to withdraw: and assuming once more his long black cloak,
disappeared through the wainscoting. He had scarcely gone before
the man at the desk touched another button, and a second secret door
was revealed. Again a man in a cloak appeared, to be followed, later
on (from a series of secret doors) by another and another and another.
When each in his turn uncloaked, he revealed to the watching
Prisoner at the window the face of either a General or a Prime
Minister of world-wide celebritv. They belonged to many Nationali-
ties. Some were French, others Germans, others Italians and Russians.
The man at the desk treated one and all with haughty abruptness.
He seemed to be giving them directions, which they appeared to be
receiving with slavish self-abnegation.
When he had dismissed the last of his distinguished visitors, he
struck a small bell which stood on the desk before him. Immediately
the thongs of the Prisoner were unloosened, and he was ushered into
the presence of the person he had been watching.
"Stand there!" said the man at the desk when the highly respect-
able Clerks who had introduced the captive had retired. "Don't
utter a word until asked a question, but take out your note-book
and listen attentively."
The man spoke in calm tones, but his voice sounded like the voice
of a never-to-be-thwarted conqueror. The Prisoner felt that resist-
ance was impossible.
"You are poor; desperate, and daring? It was for that reason I
caused you to be kidnapped. You would not shrink from any crime?"
"For a consideration," answered the Prisoner, wildly, but firmly,
"I would poison my own grandmother."
"The very man for my purpose," murmured the man at the desk—
then he said, in a louder tone, Take down the following commis-
sions. You will go to Paris, and shoot the President of the Republic
the next time he appears on the Boulevards. Then you will go to
Berlin, and blow up the King's Palace. Next you will travel to
Madrid—nay, cross that out; Ihave got all I want in that quarter—
you will travel to Vienna-and organise a Murder Conspiracy amongst
the Railway Officials." He paused, and looked at the thin piece of
paper. "And that will do for the present."
And if I do not obey?" cried the Prisoner, defiantly.
"If you do not "obey," repeated the man at the desk, leisurely,
"the Curse of the ' House' will be upon you until you die!"

SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUCH A PLEASANT WAY OF
PUTTING THINGS.

"A Sanitarium and winter resort for invalids and elderly people,
within half-a-dozen miles of Charing Cross, is seriously proposed
among the hygienic improvements of the future. Instead of going
to a Southern country, leaving friends and home comfort* behind,
the invalids and elderly persons are to enjoy a climate made up
of equal parts of Madeira, Algeria, and the South of France, at
the Alexandra Palace, on the Northern heights of the Metropolis,
and full in view of the Dome of St. Paul's."—Daily Paper.
WHENEVER the Dome of St. Paul's is visible through
the veil of smoke that habitually hides it, the effect is
certainly very picturesque.
I wonder if the fogs in Madeira in November are white
and chilling, like to-day's, or yellow and suffocating like
yesterday's.
The Koiilent Physician's manners are very pleasant,
but even he cannot prevent my feeling rather uncom-
fortable with the thermometer below zero.
In the prospectus I notice that the Sanitarium is
described as an "airy " building. Perhaps this is why
the assistance of two men-waiters and the hall-porter
is required to hinder one from being blown away on the
grand staircase.
The patient who would insist on sleeping with his
window wide open, because "he had always done so at
Madeira," will be buried, I hear, some time to-morrow.
Possibly the Resident Physician may be right in saying
that the view of London from the sky-lights is far
superior to the view of the Mediterranean from Mentone.
The influenza which I caught going to the theatre last
night, shows the enormous advantage which the neigh-
Ixmrhood of London possesses compared with Madeira,
where there are no theatres and no influenza.
By the constant yells I hear, I fancy there must be
some more than .usually important horse-race going on
u the grounds.
The last application to wind up the Sanitarium was
jostponed owing to the absence of the Matron, who is laid
ip with rheumatism and bronchitis.

Oh, anything rather than that!" shrieked the captive, and he
immediately promised to execute the commissions which had been
confided to him—promised, nay, swore!
"You can go," said the man at the desk at the conclusion of this
painful scene.
The Prisoner wavered. At length he plucked up courage, and
asked a question.
"Have you any objection to telling me your profession?"
"Not in the least," replied the man at the desk. "You will find
my description in the Post-Office Directory."
"You must be the head of some terrible Secret Society—the Gene-
ral of the Nihilists, or the King of the Irish Republicans."
"Certainly not!" returned the other, indignantly. "I am a
person of the highest respectability."
"And yet you have ordered murders, explosions, revolutions! Not
a conspirator! Then, in the name of wonder, what are you?"

To stick to what I dare to claim—plain "Mister" or " Esquire."
They call me " Mister" when they write for taxes or the rates,

THE BATHING MACHINE.
A STUDY OF A RAUE OLD CONSERVATIVE.
EHOLD an old relic of old-
fashioned days,
Recalling the coaches,
the hoy, and post-
chaise!
It has not advanced in a

Since first it was fash-
ioned by BENJAMIN
BEALE.
It is not aesthetic, nor
yet picturesque,
'Tis heavy and cumbrous,
expensive, grotesque^—
And I feel very certain
there never was seen
Such an old-fashioned thin?
as a Bathing Machine!
The windows won't open,
the doors never fit,
The floor is strewn over
with pebbles and grit;
A looking-glass too, with
a silverless back,
A pinless pincushion, a
broken boot-jack:
It "smells of old seaweed,
'tis mouldy and grim,
'Tis sloppy and stuffy, 'tis dismal and dim—
'Tis a deer-cart, a fish-van. or something between;
Oh, a hideous hutch is the Bathing Machine!
The driver says "Right!" and he raps at the door;
He starts with a jerk, and you sit on the floor!
It creaks and it rattles, you rise and you fall.
And bound to and fro like a mad tennis-ball!
Again there's a lurch, and you nearly fall flat,
And first sprain your ancle, then tread on your hat—
While you 're bumped and you 're battered, bruised blue, black,
and green,
In that horrid contrivance, the Bathing Machine!

HOW WILL IT WORK?
"According to a list we printed the other day, several Englishmen have
made vast acquisitions of land in the Western and Southern States of the Union.
British dukes and earls figure in the statement for many hundreds of thou-
sands of acres."—Daily Paper.
THE highly interesting question here raised may be best solved by
a brief extract from the Parliamentary Reports of the day—say, a
generation or two hence, as under:—
HOUSE OF LORDS. APRIL 1, 1983.
On the LORD CHANCELLOR taking his seat as usual on the Wool-
sack at a quarter past four—
The Duke of DENVER said,—He had no wish to be too smart on the
learned Boss who presided over this august Assembly, but he wanted,
as a British Peer speaking from the other side of the Atlantic, to be
informed why the sack on which his Lordship was fixed up in that
House was stuffed with Colonial Wool instead of American Cotton?
The latter was far cheaper, and, he believed, when properly doctored
with fine shavings by a patent of his own—about which he guessed
he would have something to say to their Lordships later—far softer
as chair stuffing, as his Lordship would find out if he tried a speci-
men or two he had brought with him, and now in the Lobby. He
hoped he was not misunderstood. Meantime he would lay a pro-
spectus of the concern upon the table.
The Duke of BUCCLETJCH, who was proud to say he owned not a
single acre beyond the seas, and spoke as the largest holder of landed
property in the three kingdoms, denounced the proposition as another
bit of encroaching Yankee impertinence. It was true that, owing to
the operation of successive Land Laws, all that now was left to him
was the freehold of his Park-like Villa at Walham Green; but still
such proprietorship should, he trusted, have its legitimate weight
with their Lordships. It was with a blush of shame that he reminded
the noble Duke that his illustrious ancestor, the Marquis of SALIS-
BURY, was an Englishman first and a speculator afterwards.
Lord FOKTESCTJE considered such retorts simple downright cussed-
ness, and cutely calculated to waste the time of the House. He
wished to know, too, why the two dozen extra spittoons that their
Lordships had determined to have in the Robing Room had not yet
TO!.. LXXTV.
been handed in. If Black Rod had been cornering over that job, he
should vote that that sniggering official be skewered out of his snug
box pretty sharp with an apple-slicer.
Lord ABERDEEN guessed he was of the same opinion.
After some desultory criticism on the propriety of the recent
fashion introduced by some noble Lords of amusing themselves by
whittling during the delivery of the Speech from the Throne,
The Duke of RICHMOND, GORDON and GRIGGSVILLE introduced his
Bill for the better preservation and expansion of the Tinned Pork
Monopoly Acts. He explained its provisions. He said that, speak-
ing with some warmth on behalf of the American pig-producing
interest, the measure he now proposed would make the sale of
British-fed pork practically impossible. This would be simply
effected by requiring a heavy licence to be taken out by the home
producer, while the curing of British-fed bacon would be made penal.
The impetus given to the American productive trade by such paternal
legislation would be obvious. The Tinned Pork trade would receive
a legitimate protection, and large breeders in the States, like him-
self, would get that proper encouragement from the State that they
not only expected, but had an hereditary and constitutional right to
demand.
Lord CASLINGFORD, speaking as one of the most powerful land-
owners in New Jericho, said he was darned glad to hear that obser-
vation. Upon which
The Archbishop of YORK rose, and, amid a scene of some excite-
ment, asked the LORD CHANCELLOR if, as a Spiritual Peer, he was
bound to listen to language that he had just been given to under-
stand was more fitting to the atmosphere of an American drinking
saloon. He did not like it.
The Duke of NORFOLK said that, speaking as a genuine Frisco
straight-outer, he would in that case advise the Right Reverend
Prelate to leave it; and he continued to point out that Old York and
New York were not precisely on the same spiritual platform.
Lord ROWTON was of opinion that second-class banter came but
badly from the Premier Duke of England. His peerage eould onlv
date back to the Victorian era; but he would rather sign himself
fourth Baron than be largely interested in a Bogus Embalming busi-
ness, and callous as to the use of a big big D.
The Earl of SLICKSBTTRG said that, speaking for his great ancestor,
the first Lord CALRNS, he regarded the latter portion of the Noble
Lord's speech as purely personal, and that he felt bound to argue the
matter out forcibly. Whereupon
The LORD CHANCELLOR intimated that if there was to be any firing,
he trusted to the good sense of their Lordships' House, to give him
ample time to get safe under the Woolsack.
The usual formalities were then proceeded with; and, after a brisk
use of six-shooters all round, the debate was hastily adjourned till
to-day, without a division.
THE SILVER TEMS 1
THE bntiful River's a-running to Town,
It never runs up, but allers runs down,
Weather it rains, or weather it snos;
And where it all cnms from, noboddy nose.
The young swell Boatmen drest in white,
To their Mothers' arts must be a delite;
At roein or skullin the gals is sutch dabs,
For they makes no Fowls and they ketches no Crabs.
The payshent hangler sets in a punt,
Willee ketch kold? I opes as he wunt.
I wotches him long, witch I states is fax,
He dont ketch nothin but Ticklebacks.
The prudent Ferryman sets under cover,
Waiting to take me from one shore to t'other;
I calls put " Hover !" and hover he roes,
If he aint sober then hover we goes.
When it's poring with rane and a tempest a-blowin,
A penny don't seem mutch for this here rowin;
And wen the River's as ruff as the Sea,
I thinks of the two I 'd sooner be me.
For when I 'm at work at Ampton or Lea,
Waitin at dinner, or waitin at tea,
I gits as much from a yewthful Pair
As he gits in a day for all that there.
Then let me bless my lucky Star
That made me a Waiter and not a Tar:
And the werry nex time I 've a glass of old Sherry,

And hear like ocean's thund'rous swell,
The roar of traffic on each hand.
The cabs are Ml, each 'bus and tram
Is loaded, but of course I frown
And sigh and say, it seems I am
The only person left in Town.
I wander into Drury Lane,
Or else the Gaiety at night,
Mv pilgrimage is not in vain,
Folks view the play with much delight.
Both pit and stalls are full, they roll
Applause from where the "gods" look down;
And still I am, it's really droll,—
The only person left in Town.
If at a restaurant I dine,
The waiters bustle to and fro,
And at the table next to mine
Are seated several men I know.
The same thing happens at the Club,
But who are SMITH and JONES and BROWN?
If I am really, there's the rub,—
The only person left in Town.
No matter, I shall still declare,
Since Fashion issues her decree,
That Town's a desert everywhere,
With ne'er a single soul to see.
And though some millions remain,
Of faithful subjects of the Crown,
I vow I am, it's very plain,
The only person left in Town.
"WHO shall decide where Doctors disagree?"

BOTHAM. "Why doesn't the poor man go to Aix-les-
Bains or Aachen f" It is now at the British Museum.
What a lucky man to get rid of his skin like that. In

SMITH'S plan/and sit in his bones.
A TOUR DE FORCE.
SOME doubts having been expressed in certain—evidently ill-
natured—quarters as to the real character of the "enthusiastic
reception said to have been accorded by his loyal subjects to the
young Spanish Monarch during the course of his recent provincial
tour, the following stray leaf from his own private journal, picked
up at Saragossa, will be read with satisfaction and interest:—
3 A.M. Barcelona.—Boused early by MARTINEZ CAMPOS. Says he
has heard privately from the Alcalde that several further attempts
are to be made on my life to-day. Strongly advises me not to expose
myself in public without the cover of a fish-kettle up my back. I
refuse, simply replying, "A pretty kettle of fish for a king of
Spain!" He bows himself out with a respectful smile. Evidently,
I nave said a neat thing. Mem.—To cultivate this, and keep up my
character.
4 A.M.—Bother MARTINEZ CAMPOS! Can't get to sleep again.
Never mind ; pass spare time in thinking out" neat things." Seem to
have got such a good crop of them that I rather hope I shall be shot at.
8 A.M.—Breakfast. DE LA VEGA DI ARMIJOS hurries in and begs
me not to touch the coffee. Says it is his belief that it is poisoned.
Reply at once, "Then I must see the grounds," and empty the whole
pot at a draught. Come, I think that's a good one. Great enthu-
siasm outside when he tells this to the troops.
10 A.M.—Prepare to visit the Archbishop at the Cathedral. Streets
thronged. MARTINEZ CAMPOS here again, this time pale with emotion.
Says he has just heard on best authority that a bomb is to be thrown
under my horse, en route; and, as his business is to ride behind me,
implores me, in the name of "that Spain we both so much love," to
let DE LA VEGA DI AKMIJOS take my place in the procession, dye
my hair, and walk about with him, both of us disguised, in the
crowd at the back. I instantly rejoin, with well-assumed asperity.
"The King of Spain never dyes!" This is so startlingly fresh—(I
think it is quite my best one as yet)—that it knocks MAETINEZ
CAMPOS completely over. I don't believe he '11 be able to come, after
all. Just like him!
2 P.M.—Procession over! No bomb; though I had a very smart
bit of repartee ready for the occasion—if the horse had thrown me over
his head. However, said a good thing to the Archbishop. Called me
the foundation of the kingdom. Quickly cut in with Well, come,
Your Grace, you 're the Coping Stone." Don't think he saw it; but
blessed me heartily. Shall try it on the Archbishop of somewhere
else. Saragossa perhaps.
4 P.M.—Arrived at Cardona. People _fairly enthusiastic, but seem
to require rousing by some stirring incident. Looked anxiously out
over the waving handkerchiefs for an assassin. Positively not one
to be seen. Wish MARTINEZ CAMPOS could be thrown—or something.
But he will mount such a quiet hack. Ha! at last! He has ridden
over a gamin who has got in the way. Lucky. Express eager
interest in dumb show. Mayor hurries forward, and says boy is not
hurt. I produce a pesta, and ask his name. Nobodv knows. Now's
my chance. "That's odd," I say, "for I thought everyone here
was a card-owner." Mayor in fits. Enthusiasm tremendous. Off
as fast as we can.
8 P.M. Saragossa at last. Reception really very fine, but DE LA
VEGA DI AHMIJOS and MAXTINEZ CAMPOS nagging me all the way
about possible infernal machines. Don't believe a word of it. Say
I'll " prove it," and get off my horse and walk. Crowd electrified.
Carry me on their shoulders to Archbishop's palace. Good. Arch-
bishop comes out in mitre and cope, bowing with his clergy. Fine
chance. Compliment him on the salute of his canons. Doesn't see
it, but blesses me heartilv, and says the Ancient City of the Moors
throngs to meet me. Thought he would bring in "the Moors."
Without a moment's hesitation I rejoin, "the Moor the merrier."
He sees that, and is removed in fits. Effect excellent. Dine with
the Governor, and bring in something about holders of Spanish fours
"being at sixes and sevens," owing to spiteful rumours. MARTINEZ
CAMPOS and DE LA VEGA DI ARMIJOS still bothering about poison in
soup. Forget my retort, but know it was kingly and excellent, and
took twice.
10 P.M.—To bed, safe and sound, arranging more neat things for
to-morrow.
TIME FOR "PLAYING OLD GOOSEBERRY."—The Silly Season.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
• THE DIARY OF TORY, M.P.

THE HOUR OF PARTING, OR TOBY'S LATEST PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE. A U HE VOIR!
House of Commons, Monday, August 20.—JOSEPH GILLIS'S
power of expressing thought in brief language something remarkable.
To-night, on Vote for Donegal Workhouse, JOEY B., thrusting a
thumb in either armhole of his waistcoat, and with a look of unwonted
severity mantling his genial countenance, said—
"A \Vhig is a hollow sham."
Criticism might be raised on point of relevance of remark. Whigs
have nothing to do with Donegal Workhouse, nor Donegal Work-
house with Whigs. But only poor mind would raise trivial objections
of that kind. Sensible people only too glad to have opportunity of
seizing great truths howsoever disclosed. Asked him later, "What
is a Whig?"
"A Whig," said JOSEPH GILLIS, in same sententious manner. "is
anyone I don't like. TREVELYAN 's a Whig; GLADSTONE 's a Whig.
You 're all Whigs."
"That, I suppose, is why you 're always giving us a wigging."
The lower part of JOSEPH'S face slowly opened. Cavity widened,
till I was afraid his ears would get buried in it.
JOSEPH GILLIS was smiling!
Very kind of him to encourage my little efforts to please. But he
is just now in high spirits. For weeks been doomed by PARNELL'S
new policy to sit silent, seeing Bills pass, and Votes agreed to.
Might occasionally, when PARNELL away, cry "Hear! hear!" or
"Oh! oh!" but nothing more. Now HEALY broke loose. Gone on
the rampage; determined to show that Irish Parliamentary rowdyism
only in its infancy. JOSEPH delighted beyond measure.
TIM 's something like a feller," says he. "Sometimes I suspect
PARNELL of being a whig. Nothing of a Whig about TIM HEALY."
"No," I said. "Unite the contrary. Hair, if anything, cropped
too close."
Said this with a purpose. Wanted to see JOSEPH'S seraphic smile
again. Thought perhaps on second attempt at least one of his ears
might go. Interesting thing to note for a diary. "Remarkable
natural phenomenon." "Ear tor-day and gone to-morrow"; and that
sort of thing. But J. G. too much engrossed in contemplation of
HEALY'S superior merits.
"Hard work to beat him on Saturday," he continued. "When he
accused TKEVELYAN of murdering Irishmen and spitting Irish babes
on bayonets, felt quite low. Sure I couldn't top that. But when
Grand Old Man talked of probability of his presently going off the
hooks, and 1 cheered the prospect, rather think I beat him. Don't
want to boast too much of it; but SPEAKER says it's the most brutal
remark he ever heard in the House, and he's been here for twenty
years and heard all our rows of last nine years. Told HEALY this;
made him quite mad. Says he '11 beat my score before Session closes.
If he does, must go Nap on him. Afraid it '11 be hard work. But up
to now I think I 'm ahead." Business done.—Brought in Appropria-
tion Bill, happy harbinger of end!
Tuesday.—House of Lords had high old time to-night. Threw out
everything they safely could and mauled the remainder.
"We '11 show the Commons that there are Barons in England yet,"
said the Lord Markis, bending his beetling brows upon Earl GRAN-
VTLLE. GRANVILLE nods, and smiles pleasantly.
"Go your way, my Lord," he says. "Grieved for the Irish and
Scotch, but, from purely party point of view, nothing better for us.
Only sorry we couldn t manage to give you fuUer opportunity.
Already given England a kick by mutilating the Agricultural
Holdings Bills. You gave Ireland a whack on the head by throwing
out Parliamentary Registration Bill, and you serve out a backhander
to Scotland by throwing out Local Government Board Bill. Wish
we had a Bill promoted from the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey,
Alderney, or Sark. You might as well go the whole hog. What a
Leader it is! What a Premier it would make!"
Fancy this is sarcastic. But no doubt about genuineness of enthu-
siasm on part of Lord REDESDALE.
"Spoke to you the other day, TOBY," says he, "about West-
minster Abbey. Never mind just now. A little low then. Feeling
disappointed in SALISBURY. But now he's better than ever. This is
what I call Statesmanship. Wish it was not so late in the Session.
Otherwise would certainly introduce my Bill for the Abolition of the
House of Commons. SALISBURY in humour to back it, and Majority
safe to carry it. Shall give notice for next Session."
HARCOURT looking on from Privy Councillor's place by Throne,
watched with much interest process of chucking out.
"Curious," he says, "to reflect on the Community of human
nature. Often find, in studying Police-Court Reports, that when a
man gets drunk he begins throwing furniture put of the window.
House of Lords, politically inebriate, pitch out Bills promiscuously."
House of Commons debating Appropriation Bill. STAFFORD NORTH-
COTE plays feeble tune on Parliamentary organ. Sort of quadrille,
introducing all old and familiar airs sung through Session about
Transvaal, BRADLAUGH, India, Ireland, and the rest. GLADSTONE
comes out with brass band all fresh and strong, and completely
drowns the wheezy organ. ASHMEAD BARTLETT comes to rescue,
and in luminous speech discusses everything, including Mr. DODDS,
whom he says he is accustomed to treat with profound contempt.
"ASHMEAD," says the SOLICITOR-GENERAL, "is a kind of Parlia-
mentary WHITELEY, a Universal Provider. Always in stock, pro-
ducible at moment's notice and anything yon may want, from
Tamatave to the Ventilators on the Embankment."
ASHMEAD, by the way, started new motto for Ms family crest:
"I for Eye."
Business done.—Appropriation Bill read a Second Time.
Wednesday.—Glorious victory for Markis. Carried by Majority
of One his Amendment to Agricultural Holdings Bill against dis-
agreement of Commons. Ooray! Would have been more only Duke
ot RICHMOND went with Liberals. A little awkward it seems on the
face of it since RICHMOND is special authority on Agricultural
Policy. The Markis only liked it the more.
"Scarcely worth trouble to divide against other Bide,"the says.

"Can do that any day, and beat "em. But if when you divide the
Front Bench, go one way yourself and principal colleague goes the
other, life begins to be worth living."
Soothed by this great victory, Markis doesn't further insist upon
his amendments.
"Suppose it's all right," says hold BUCCLEUCH. "But confess I
don't quite see it. Seems to me, SALISBURY'S making us look a little
ridiculous. Blusters and threatens the Commons, cuts their Bill to
pieces; drives tenant-farmers into arms of Liberals; then, when
Commons put up their back and stand by their Bill, we sneak off, let-
ting them undo all our work. This may be high statesmanship.
Fancy it is, since SALISBURY arranged it, but don't quite see it."
In the Commons, Indian Budget on at last. End of last Session
promise given that it
should be introduced
this year earlier than
ever, instead of which it
is later.
"But what can you
expect from ANANIAS
and SHAPIRA," says Lord
GEOBGE HAMILTON, hur-
rying in from British
Museum, where has been
looking at new version
of Deuteronomy.

Lord RONALD GOWER, hearing I was writing a Diary, begged me of
all things not to write in it spiteful things about my contemporaries.
"Caddish," he says, "to go to a man's house, retail his conversation,
sell it in two volumes to a Publisher, and print it hot and hot."
RONALD an authority on this matter. Mean always to stand by
his instructions.
Business done.—Peers cave in on Agricultural Holdings Bill.
Thursday.—Last chance of doing justice to Ireland. Appropria-
tion Bill down for Third Reading. Now or never for emptying the
sewer. Wouldn't have supposed there was anything left after Mon-
day in last week and Saturday. Seems to be sort of return pipe.
TIM can pour it out on Monday or Saturday till the sewer seems
quite dry, and on Thursday on opening the mouth there is the stream
as thick and as noisome as ever.
JOSEPH GILOS confined his eloquence to occasional efforts to get
House Counted Out. If he succeeded, all arrangements for Proroga-
tion be upset. SPEAKER, Government, and about a hundred Mem-
bers kept in town into next week. JOSEPH'S gentle eyes glisten at
the notion. Tried once or twice. But Lord RICHARD is, as he com-
plains, "on the ky rivy." Members troop in, House made, and
—then—troop out again, whilst sewer outfall continues, and swamps
House otherwise nearly empty.
Only Attorney-General for Ireland on Treasury Bench—he and
TREVELYAN, with HAHTINGTON occasionallylookingin. HABTTNGTON
has to make a speech on Indian Debate. Horrid bore, but someone
must say last word for Lord RTPON, and no one better than Lord
HAHTINGTON. So sits and yawns audibly. Keeps himself awake by
balancing hat on bridge of nose. Once, yawn coming suddenly
whilst hat in critical position, it nearly fell into his mouth. This
woke him, and Sir GEORGE CAMPBELL, pleasantly rising to " expose
the qui bono" of the adjourned debate, HABTINGTON made capital
speech, full of point and vigour. Not the slightest trace of yawn in it.
But this came after the deluge, which went on till half-past eleven
in monotonous mechanical style. CALLAN belching forth incoherent
vulgarity, O'BRIEN hissing out hatred between clenched teeth, and
Tnt HEALY working himself up into Stage passion, melodramatically
maligning mankind in general, and, in particular, "thrampling on
the Saxon" as did the lamented but obscure " Gineral JACKSON.
Much of the abuse levelled at Attorney-General for Ireland, who

Switzerland! Ah! Let's g^o home, and pack.
Business done.—Commons wind up everything.
Friday.—Commons not sitting to-day. Lords have it all to them-
selves. "And quite right, too!" the Markis says. "'Tisn't often—
only about once a Session—that we can thoroughly enjoy ourselves.
Should be allowed to do it without counter-attraction of other House
sitting." So Conservative Lords gather together round hospitable
board, and favourite dish served up. The other day a good big bundle
of the succulent vegetable. To-day only one, being the Amendment to
the Agricultural Holdings Bill, which the Markis stoutly swore that,

AGRICULTURAL HOLDINGS BILL.
come what might, he would stick to. Dish, borne shoulder high,
carried round in triumph by the Markis himself and Earl REDES-
DALE, as being representative of the type without which these joyous
Salisbury saturnalia at end of Session could not be.
"Tastes differ," said the Markis, setting the dish down in the
middle, and seizing the solitary succulent between finger and thumb.
"But if there's one thing I like, it's the leek."
Then he ate it, and Conservative Peers went home more than ever
convinced of the greatness of their Leader.
Business done.—Markis eats the leek, and the Agricultural Hold-
ings Bill passes as settled by the Commons.
Saturday.—Prorogation. Rather a dull ceremony. The LORD
CHANCELLOR and other elderly Gentlemen got themselves up in red
gowns, and were nearly as determinedly funny as the Savages at the
Albert Hall. Looking down on scene from Gallery was Japanese
Minister, Mr. MOBI (mem. not memento).
"Getting up a Parliament down our way," says his Excellency;
"so just looked in to see how it's worked. Better go over to Japan
in Recess, TOBY, and see our young Parliament. ITO writes me,
'Getting on nicely. Have set up a Biggar, turned out a very respect-
able imitation of O'DoNNELL; now manufacturing a Cavendish
Bentinck; have an Ashmead Bartlett in our Eye, and hope soon to
have a Warton. Some difficulty about this last. Had to behead
fourteen before we could get one to take snuff properly.' ITO wants
to know whether there's anything more wanted to make first-class
House of Commons. Wish you 'd go over and give him a few hints.
Not far. Think it over." I will.
Business done.—All.
LE CHOLERA ANGLOPHOBE.
SCIENTIFIC REPORT.—This grievous malady has been discovered
by me to be essentially an affection of the stomach, and as such of
course directly traceable to English sources—or, if the gravity of
Science permitted, one might say sauces. For, it being a notorious
fact that the English are the most gluttonous and least delicate race
in Europe, it follows logically that the disease is of Anglo-Saxon
creation. The ordinary English diet of cucumbers and raw rump-
steaks is peculiarly conducive to the propagation of Cholera. Then
look at the connection between Cholera and the national malady,
the Spleen. I have also noticed several symptoms, in my experi-
ments at the Hotel Dieu, which abundantly support my theory.
There is the blueness of the skin—and we all know the English love
of "True Blue," "Blue Ruin," &c. There can be no doubt that
Cholera is entirely English in its origin, and is perhaps used by the
insular Government to destroy life where its ships and its armies are
ineffectual. j. pASTErK.

In the Gig, rowing towards the Yacht Creusa.—MELLEVILLE
steering, my travelling companion, whose name is KILLICK—I only
recall it when he is so addressed by MET.T.KVTT.T.K
—sitting opposite to me. To put it sociably.
MELLEVILLE, our host, is in the chair, supported
on either side by KILLICK and myself. As I am
undecided whether to call him "Skipper" or
"Commodore "—an old difficulty with me—I, as
a Happy Thought medium, decide to address him
Americanly as "Boss," and do so accordingly.
"Boss" is an excellent word. This brings out
my travelling-companion, KILLICK, of whom up
to this moment I have had not much experience,
except when in a state of early semi-conscious-
ness, and evincing a tendency to irritability, or
hopelessly fast asleep and snoring, who has, I flnd,
a sharp and nasty way of asserting as a positive
fact anything of which he knows much, little, or
nothing, which would be decidedly objectionable to strangers were it
not for his readiness so to modify his original statement whatever it
was.if either verypolitely questioned, or if left utterly uneontradicted,
as to bring it into substantial accordance with the most opposite expres-
sion of opinion on the same subject. He at once protests against my
adoption of the term'' Boss," and says, frowning, and in a hard, incisive
tone, as if his voice were coming up through a nutmeg-grater — (I
find afterwards that he is a sweet singer and excellent musician,
and it is. I believe, proverbial that all sweet singers have bad speaking]
voices, though I am not sure whether the converse holds good—as il
so, what a lot of undiscovered sweet singers there must be among
costermongers, dustmen, cabmen, and, on the whole, practising bar-
risters)—KILLICK says, shortly—" shortly " is the word, never was a
happier description of his usual manner—KILLICK says, shortly,
"Pooh! Not' Boss!' He's the ' Governor.'" I reply, with quiet
determination, seeing the man I have to deal with—(how thankful 1
am now that he was asleep all the night when I was awake in the
train!)—that "I personally prefer 'Boss.'" To which KILLICK
replies, a trifle less shortly than before, "Well, I should say
'Governor.'"
I feel it would be in bad taste, in presence of MELLEVILLE, himself, to
pursue the discussion further. It being a matter entirely unimportant,
I yield, and address MELLEVILLE as Commodore, whereupon KILLICK
immediately observes, as a concession, "that there is no real objec-
tion to 'Boss'—only that it is not a term used in the Navy." I agree
with him again, which seems to make him quite fidgety.
Five minutes rowing brings us to the yacht. The Captain is ready
to receive us. He is a stout, square-built, pleasant-looking man, with
a mild-speaking voice (so many professional nautical men have mild
persuasive voices when they are unprofessionaUy engaged, so that if
it is characteristic of a sweet singer,—as in KlLLiars case, above-
mentioned, which sounds like quoting a legal precedent, the well-
known l\i!lii-l.-\ Case,—to have a Dad-speaking voice, so it is evidently
characteristic of a professional nautical person who can shout out
"Belay!" and, as the song says, "rant and roar like true British
sailors," to have a peculiarly mild and pleasant-speaking voice for
use in ordinary eonversation. There is a bright-faced smiling young
man—(he salutes us, and is as pleased to see us as is the Captain)—
who at once possesses himself of our luggage, and disappears below,
whither we follow him. This bright young person is Steward,
Butler, Valet, Chambermaid, all in one, equally obliging and ready
in each capacity, and is the personification of the Happy valet.
We are 'shown to our cabins. Mine is palatial. It is situated
aft," and has the curious appearance of having been built in per-
spective. The cupboard-doors, the drawers, the lockers, and wash-
stand are all slanting towards a point of sight. There is a sofa,
arranged on the same principle—and everything in the cabin follows,
so to speak, the same lines, so that the general arrangement is
that of a scene on the stage, arranged to give an audience the effect
of length and distance. There is a lofty skylight, and plenty of air.
Each drawer is fitted with a small bolt outside, intended to be of
service in rough weather, by preventing the drawer slipping out, but
at present these bolts are only irritating, as they insist on slipping
down just when yon want to open the drawer, and, on being carefully
replaced, immediately falling down again when you have got hold of the
handles and have given the draw a hrst pull. I say a first pull,"
because the drawers being, as I have observed, built in perspective,
their peculiarities have to be considered. Baffled in my first few
attempts at opening one of them, I stop to consider which end is to
come out first—the small or largest,! try each alternately, when
suddenly it startles me by coming out with a savage rush, as it were
at me, when luckily it is caught by some ingeniously-contrived ledge
within, and prevented from tumbling out altogether on to the floor,
in which case I know that, unassisted, I should never get it into its
place again.
The Happy Valet, or epitome of all that is useful in man,
smilingly removes my bags, shows me where to put certain things in
safety, where they wont fall about and be broken "when the
vessel's in motion, when it's at all rough, Sir," he adds, more smilingly
than ever; and I reply, "Ah! true!" as certain reminiscences occur
to];ne, and I wonder if I am going to be a good sailor this time—or
no< / I am sure that when everything goes wrong, when the Yacht
is heeling over, when there's every chance of our all visiting the
abode of that Welsh Mariner known as " DAVY JONES'S locker," this
Young Steward, or Happy Valet, will still be smiling and pleasant
up to the last; and in tact, as a Happy Thought, I name him (to
myself—not publicly) as Mark Tapley. Junior, and I should not be
surprised at hearing that this is his real name.
However, we are at anchor, and in Larne Harbour now, and it's
luncheon-time, so away with morbid anticipations! Let us eat and
drink, and be happy while we can. But, dear me, these are not the
sentiments with which to begin a holiday health-trip. No! I am
longing.to be out to sea, to be sailing away, any number of sheets in
the wind—[ Query,—How did the expression arise? Perhaps before
sails were invented they used to use their sheets in this way by day,
and sleep in "em at night. But why does "three sheets in the
wind" mean a state of intoxication'(, Probably, because it is as
much as he can carry. Then this would only apply to a compara-
tively small boat. This hundred-and-forty tonner can set six or
eight sheets to the wind, for example. But I "11 ask the Captain]—
and to be going somewhere with a fair wind, a bright sky, and at the
rate of so many knots an hour.
My host asks me what I would like to do this afternoon? My
impulse is to reply at once, "Why, sail, of course. Start away, and
sail awav somewhere, anywhere, everywhere—till dinner-time, when
I should like to be quiet." However, I don't say this, but suavely
reply—for MELLEVILLE is himself the essence of courtesy, and a
perfect host—" Oh, whatever you'.like—it's all the same to me"—
which is a polite fiction on my part, as I am anything but indifferent
on the subject. "Well," he says, pleasantly, "What would you
like to do, CHAYLEY?" CKAYLEY is the other passenger, our " Fourth
Party," athin, delicate-looking man, who changes in different light

would like it any better on a longer acquaintance]—and presents him-
self in various aspects, from twenty-seven up to fifty, and of whom
no one ever sees more than half at a time, as he has a way of doing
everything sideways, so that he is always in profile. He listens to
you in profile, left or right as the case may be, as if he were perpetu-
ally trying his ears to find out which was the more useful of the two.
His left eye has an easy time of it, as his right does all the work
with the assistance of an eye-glass. He eyes everything sideways,
screwing up the corner_of his mouth, and frowning with his right
eyebrow, which gives him a puzzled expression; ana when he drops
his glass and gives his left eye a turn, he elevates the side of his face
to which that eye belongs, and surveys everything with an air of
wonderment, as though this eye was seeing it all for the first time,
and was quite surprised, but still delighted with the treat. Our
Fourth Party is very natty in dress, and very quiet in
manner.
CRAYLEY says he would like to take a walk up to the Druid's Stone,
or go into the town.
Good gracious! I haven't come on board the hundred-and-forty-
four-tonner merely to go on shore again and take a walk to see a
Druid's Stone, or visit a country town!
However, I am agreeable to anything. KILLICK says, shortly, he
"doesn't believe that there is a Druid's Stone." KILLICK is very short;
in fact, he gets shorter and shorter every moment. CBAYLEY, exam-
ining him with a side-glance, replies quietly, '' that this Druid's Stone
is a celebrated one." With a view to sitting on and crushing
KILLICK, I encourage CHAYLEY by inquiring, simply, "Is it?"
"0 yes," replies CEAYLEY, turning his right ear towards me—(he
is my vis-a-vis at table)—and scrutinising me narrowly through his.
glass in his right eye, as if he were assuring himself of my being
perfectly in earnest—"0 yes; this Druid's Stone is mentioned by—

up his>ther ear to the point of attention, as though, like JOAN of
Arc, he were listening for " the voicea" to remind nim of what he;
is puzzling his brains to recollect. "Um!"—he goes on—" bless
my soul!—I was only reading the book the other day "—here he turns
one side to KILLICK, then round to MELLEVILLE, and then again to1
ne, as if he was quite astonished to find that none of us could tell'
lim what he was reading the other day—" Dear me! I do forgeti
lames so!"—and here he is becoming quite annoyed with everybody—>

given up all idea of consulting such ignoramuses as we seem to be,
and was going to trust to himself once more.
MELLEVILLE, in order, as host, to show some sort of interest in the
subject, asks, vaguely, but most courteously, "What sort of a book
was it?"
"Oh," replies CRATLET, with a half-turn towards him and his
eye-glass up to "attention" again, "it was the well-known hook
by—bless my soul 1—0, you know it!"
MELLEVILLE takes a small biscuit, and, out of compliment to his
guest, assumes a meditative air, as if the name of the book and its
author were at the present moment occupying his entire attention.
KILLICK, who has been silent all the time, for the simple reason
that he has been busy in helping himself to everything on the table,
now pushes his plate away with the air of a man who is disgusted
with life, and who, like an over-fed and rebellious Daddy Longlegs,
will not say his grace after meals, rises from his chair, and says—
shortly, of course—" Druids' Stones are all humbug." And with
this contemptuous expression of opinion, he puts on nis cap with a
jerk, and struts out of the saloon; then he is neard pacing the deck.
He seems to have included us—our host and all—in his sweeping
assertion about the Druidical Stones.
We decide, however, by three to one, KLLLICK yielding with a bad
grace: on visiting the Druids' Stone. We go ashore on the side
opposite Larne Harbour. Our host, who seems a little nervous at
this sudden disturbance, of which he had received no sort of fore-
cast, threatening the quiet of his cruise—for he and CRAYLEY have
been yachting companions for six weeks previous to our arrival—
now proposes a move on deck, to which we at once assent. So our
host leads. I come next, and CBAYLEY follows, silent, thoughtful,
and with a sort of haughty bearing that clearly expresses his annoy-
ance. He gives an occasional sniff of impatience, as if KILLICX'S
contradiction had got into his nose and stuck there on its way to his
brain. From the summit of the hill, a gentle ascent made under a
hot sun which has come out to remind us that Summer is not dead
yet, we obtain a good bird's-eye view of Larne itself, a very rising
place, as every town ought to be when situated in a valley, if, that
is, it has aspirations as lofty as its surroundings. In a few years'
time Larne will be creeping up its own hills. On a strip of land near
the harbour there are some very modern-looking villas, and a
solemnly grand Hotel, which have the air of beinjf a little in advance
of their time, and to be patiently waiting the arrival of the resident*
and visitors, who so far have disappointed them. But as the old
song says, "There is agood time coming, boys," and our Lamed
friends can afford to "Wait a little longer."

Of the Session of Eighteen Eighty-Three.
Its days were exceedingly long in the land,
Thougli it honoured nothing. To understand
Its raison d'etre, a man must know
The use of rot and unlimited row;
With every feature of farce,—save wit.
Like a " needless Alexandrine," it
"Dragged its slow length." and feebly stang,
Having naught of the snake but its venomed fang.
What was said of the dress of a modish dame
Needs but reversal to sum its "fame ";
For its very best friends would sadly state
It began too soon and ended too late.

did nothing of the kind, but he
might have done so had the gun-
powder gone off before it was

THE LAY OF THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE.
AIR—" The Lord Chancellor'! Sony in " lolanthe."
A LORD Chief Justice, by common consent,
Is Law's most lovely embodiment;
For the Chancellor, though a thing of dread,
Is a sort of a perfunctory figurehead.
And that is why the American Bar
Have selected Me to travel afar.
A very agreeable jaunt, and one
That will lead, I trust, to some excellent fun,
And furnish a capital holiday
For a most mellifluous Lord Chief J.
All. And furnish, &c.,
But though the compliment implied
Inflates me with legitimate pride,
It nevertheless can t be denied
That it has a—ahem!—dangerous side.
For I 'm not so old or melancholic
As to be quite proof 'gainst the love of frolic,
And there 'd be the deu well, a certain risk,
If the Lord Chief Justice began to frisk.
A possibility, I should say,
For a peripatetic Lord Chief J.
All. A possibility, &c.
I must keep on myself strict watch and ward,
Lest in more than one sense I should be abroad;
For the Themis young of America
Is a very agreeable girl, they say;
She has affable manners—and customs free—
And—she laughs at wigs! Oh! deary me.
I must be as careful as careful can be,
Lest / should forget Law's dignitee.'
'Tis a sore temptation to throw in the way
Of such a susceptible Lord Chief J.!

WE read irj a recent number of the Daily Telegraph that a
Clergyman connected with Llanddyffnan-with-Llanfairmathavar-
neithof, county of Anglesea, having been a teetotaller for the
last three years and a half, has had his suspension relaxed. This
is all right and proper. But our only wonder is that an incumbent
of any parish bearing such a name should ever have been anything
but a teetotaller. Fancy having to say " The country is truly rural
in the neighbourhood of Llanddyffnan-with-Llanfairmathavarnei-
thof," unless your brain was at its clearest and your utterance the
most distinct.

CHILDE CHAPPIE'S PILGRIMAGE.
CANTO THE FOURTH.
So CHAPPIE, inly wearied, fared along;
Yet not insensible to all which here
Savours of jocund
health and man-
hood strong.
In scenes of
strenuous toil
and wholesome
cheer,
Where sturdy
striplings smote
the leathern
sphere
"With valiant vi-
gour, he would
take his place,
Of feelings boyish, pleasure frank and clear,
Signs were not always absent from his face,
When swift MACAULAY kicked, or swiped colossal GRACE.

He had not " cut" athletics, though long days
Of dawdling had not strengthened pull or thrust
Of scull or punt-pole; he could lounge and gaze,
At Henley, in soft flannels; the heart must
At time leap back to warmth, though cold mistrust
Be the "good form " of worldlings. CHAPPIE felt
The strong spell of the River: far from dust
And crowded bars his mood would sometimes melt,
As he in pleasant bower midst Thames's boskage dwelt.
m.
And he had learned to love—we knew not why,
For this, in such as he, seemed foreign mood—
A quiet whiff in some backwater shy.
Perhaps, 'twas early memories; what subdued
To tastes like these a soul so far imbued
With scorn of " rot" it little boots to know;
But so it was. Yet in such solitude
Small time his chums left him to "maunder" so,
Sentiment's gleam died out with his cigar's red glow.

And there were venal breasts, as hath been said, .
Whereto his life was linked by stronger ties
Than mooning hours could break; long evenings sped
In orgies wild, and far beyond disguise,
Or shackle of the dull proprieties
His life from healthful ease divided more.
Talk of loose lips and play of wanton eyes
May make a Capua e'en of Thames's shore.
Song to that silver stream a bacchant strain might pour.

Roofs of the j oiliest of hotels
Gleam o'er the river's gleaming line.
Whose silver breast bears Belles and Swells
To dinner at the day's decline.
And Richmond Hill is thick with trees,
Like scattered stars the town-lights shine.
Sleek head reclining on my knees
Art sleepy? Soon the sparkling wine
Shall part those lips I scarce can see
In rosy mirth and rapturous glee.

And gay-frocked girls, with bistred eyes,
And hands—" in sixes "—soft as flowers,
Deem yon an earthly Paradise
Above all charm of feudal towers.
Its sheeny roof, its walls of grey,
Upon whose stones the moonlight showers.
More welcome^are at close of day
Than Paphian grots or vintage bowers.
Rave not of castles on the Rhine,
The " Star and Garter's " roof be mine!
3.
LILLA! Those, lilies,—plucked by me,—
Burden the bearer overmuch:
I know that they must withered be,
Dead rubbish cast aside as such!
What can you cherish long as dear?
So manv offerings meet your eye.
Eh? What? The idiom sounds queer
From gentle lips ;—but dinner's nigh,
And " Tamise ripe" will " lick " the Rhine
For savoury cates and sparkling wine.

The River nobly shines and flows,
Its shores are sweet enchanted ground,
But all the charms its sweeps disclose
What arc they in the revel's round?
The coldest breast might hotly bound
In the mad frolic reigning here;
In mirth and brimming cups are drowned
Calm Nature's voice, which sounds less clear
Where wanton eyes the stars outshine
By Thames or on the banks of Rhine.
v.
Adieu to thee, fair Thames! How long, delighted,
Sound hearts would loiter on thy watery way.
Not theirs these scenes; passion and greed united
In such wild Saturnalia seek their prey.
Insatiate vultures, feeding day by day
On self-condemning bosoms. The last cheer
Of the wild revellers on their homeward way
Hath many echoes sinister and drear,
Haunting the hollow life for many a wasted year.

Their fate; and striplings of the Chappie crew,
Self-deemed astute and in all life-lore old,
Are swine of CEKCE'S herd or sheep of LILITH'S fold.

FAREWELL, oh farewell to the Holiday Season!
(Thus murmured a Minstrel just back from the sea.)
I 'm glad to return unto rhyme and to reason;
In London once more I 'in delighted to be!
Ah! sweet were the days in the Upper Thames reaches,
How happy the doing of nothing at all!
And sweet, too, the flavour of ripe sunny peaches,
That dropped in our hands from the Rectory wall.
But long shall I cherish, through dreary December,
The thought of that even we drifted away:
The twilight, the silence, I long shall remember,
The flash of the oar and the perfume of hay.
And still, when " My Queen " the street-organ is playing,
Or " Patience" is blown by cacophonous bands,
I smile on the discord, I nod to the braying,
And muse with delight upon Scarborough Sands.
The young laughing maids, with their salt-sprinkled tresses,
Let artfully down on their shoulders to dry;
I see, on the Spa, in their pretty pink dresses:
MAUD, MABEL, and DOLLY, ana DAISY, and Vi.
Nor did COOK and his coupons a moment forget me;
My passeport was vise the length of my flight;
While Murray and Bradshato did aid and abet me,
And Corns with the circular notes was all right.
Farewell—when at bedtime I sink on my pillow
I dream of my toil up the snow-covered steep,
And mules, retturini, and boats on the billow,
And polyglot waiters embitter my sleep!
Ah, me! oft at night how I painfully worry
To think where on earth I nave possibly been?
Of towns, half-forgotten, I saw in a hurry,
And ghosts of the " lions" I ought to have seen!
And now, when the Club becomes cheerful and crowded,
And men are returning all hearty and brown;
While the room with the vesper tobacco is clouded—
'Tis pleasant, most pleasant to get back to town!
Farewell, oh farewell, for dear London is pleasant,
No longer I feel inclination to roam:
I think, as I stir up the coals incandescent,
I 'm awfully glad to be once more at home!

"ELLOW, 'ERRY! WHY, 'ow ARM YER?"
EN CAR-RAT, OLE MAN! 'Ow's YFRSELF?"
SYMPATHY WITH A STATUE.
To the Right Honourable G. J. SHAW-LEFEVRE, Chief Commissioner of Public
Works, the humble Petition of Gog and Magog, Giants, of Guildhall, in the
City of London, Humbly Sheweth—That your Petitioners have learned to their
great Alarm and Consternation that it is intended by the Board over which
your Honour presides to appoint and order the Great Wellington Statue, lately
lowered to the ground opposite Hyde-Park Corner, to be transmuted, trans-
mogrified, and transposed by breaking of it up, and melting of it down, and
then recasting of it into another Statue of the same Original, to be erected
somewhere else than the site which the present Statue now stands upon.
That the only reason hitherto assigned for the scheme of subjecting the Wel-
lington Statue to the treatment above specified is the allegation of its demerits
as a Work of Art, being a hu(je, grotesque, ugly, misshapen, and monstrous
Object—monstrum horrendttm, informe, ingeni, as your Petitioners have heard
it called in a Latin quotation.
That the steps proposed to be taken with the Wellington Statue on the fore-
going pretences would be more or less applicable also to almost all the other
public Statues in London, particularly those of GEORGE THE FOURTH. NELSON,
NAPIER, and HAVEI.OOK in Trafalgar Square, and not only them, but, likewise, to
many if not most of the Sculptures in Westminster Abbey, and not a few of the
same sort in St. Paul's Cathedral, insomuch that, if carried out, those measures
would finally result in the transformation and transference, or else the removal
and absolute demolition of nearly all the Metropolitan Statues, perhaps including
even ourselves, however superior in artistic conception and execution we may be
allowed to be in comparison with the majority of the rest.
That all our principal Compeers of the plastic kind, whether Graven or
Molten Images, how humble soever their rank as ornamental Objects, are not
only memorials of eminent individuals, but also monuments of British Art,
representing successive stages and states of it as peculiar to the different earlier
or later periods of their erection. That, therefore, their historical as well as
their biographical value entitles them to preservation. That the process oi
removing and remodelling the Wellington Statue, if accomplished, will effecl
the introduction of the Thin End of the Wedge, whereof the thick end would be
sooner or later driven home to the probable dislodgment or destruction of your
Petitioners.
That in case the City of London and its Statues and all surroundings gol
swallowed up by an Earthquake and the Wellington Statue, or your Petitioners
one or both of them, were exhumed at the expiration of
several thousands of years, they would be regarded as
leasures of the highest archaeological value, and very
jossibly be transported at a vast expense, and deposited
n an Antipodean museum. That accordingly both they
and it should be prospectively accounted things precious to
Posterity and on that account deserving the most careful
maintenance, both in situation and state. Wherefore
four Petitioners humbly request and beseech that the
Monster Statue of the late illustrious Duke of WELLINGTON
nay be suffered to remain as nearly as possible both where
it is and as it is. And your Petitioners, as in duty bonnd,

CROMER CLIFFS!
HERE on my back in the sunshine lying
On the Lighthouse Cliffs amidst flowers and grass,
I dreamily stir when the swallow is flying,
And lazily listen when travellers pass:
For the sea at the foot of the crags is breaking,
And the breeze that's stirring the ferns is pure,
So I ask where the rest of the world is taking,
In orthodox fashion, its annual cure.
Why don't they settle their " ehs ?" and " if s,"
And come and be lazy on Cromer Cliffs?
I cannot confess to an envious minute
Since first this village I came across,
For the sea-sick traveller can't be in it
With the usual gambol of pitch-and-toss!
I wouldn't exchange your Pontresinas,
Your Alpine valleys, and castled Rhine
For my morning " weed " from a box of " Finas,"
And a drink of air that has strength like wine.
The cosiest corner for holiday whiffs
Is found in a hollow of Cromcr Cliffs!
I can see them rushing in tourist fashion
In desperate hurry by midnight train, _
With fever, and fret, and dust, and passion,
To mountain mists and the Righi rain;
From Spa to Spa they will pass and follow
The crowds that hunt in Royalty's wake,
But it grieves not me as I watch the swallow,
And watch the wheat that the breezes shake.
If you 'd all be free from tourists' tiffs,
You would sleep off care on the Cromer Cliffs.
They will tear with a guide through an ancient city,
And faithfully "do' a cathedral town;
They will climb their peaks, and—more's the pity—
Directly they 're up they must needs come down;
They will bargain hard for a dirty dwelling,
On the coast of France in a fisherman's cot,
For the proud return to their homes, and telling
They 've managed to see what their friends have not.
If they only could hear the "poohs and "pifis"
Of the elderly cynic on Cromer Cliffs!
I can only hear, if I pause to listen,
The sweep of scythe through the falling corn,
I can only see how the sun can glisten
Its dewdrop tears in the fields at morn;
I can only know that I lie in clover
On the top of the down and in sight of the sea;
I can only wish each obstinate rover
Were half as happy as I can be.
So put in your pocket your " ahs !" and "ifs,"
And come and get brown on Cromer Cliffs!
NEWS FROM JIM THE PEJTMAENJIAWR MAN.—A report
got about that very nearly brought Mr. IRVING back to
London, and might have made him forego his American
tour. It was that Mr. GLADSTONE, during the recess, was
going to play The Bells. It turned out that the PREMIES
had promised to give a peal of bells to the chnrch of Pen-
maenmawr in Wales. He is not going to play them him-
self, and Our Only Tragedian being satisfied, "on we goes
again." Out of gratitude, the Penmaenmawr people will
give Mr. GLADSTONE honorary rank in their Volunteer Corps
as Triple-Bob-Major, but having got so far as being called
"Bob," why not style him at once Sir Robert Peal (of
Bells),—non obstante Sir Roberto Barto f

MR. GEORGE WHITE. ex-Captain and senior Champion of the
Portsmouth Swimming Club, may be congratulated on hia successful
attempt to swim the Solent from Southsea Pier to Ryde. This
exploit, as Old Father Neptune told the Tritons, was admirable, but
insolent all the same.
MRS. RAMSBOTHAM writes to us:—" I am towering in Wales. The
other night we went up Snowdon by moonlight, and were charged
two shillings for a glass of water, while my Nephew had to pay the
same for the loan of an extra coat to keep off the cold. He says that
this is the sort of thing one must expect from Welshers, though I
don't see why we should, having experienced nothing but honesty
and moderation up to now. But I must say, at the rate we paid for
it—though of course Snowdon is high, and the charges may rise in
proportion—I do think the view from the top is strikingly expensive,
ana the scenery quite superfluous."
WATER RATES.—Extra charge for high service. Ritualists ought
to be charged more than other people, because they prefer the very
highest of High Services. Alas, for taxes, &c., &c.! As the Immortal
Bard says, or very nearly—" There be land rates and water rates,"
and we detest them all equally.

"A DAY IN THE COUNTRY."
("Constitutional" Experience. Old Oentlcman gushes.)
1 SAUNTER homewards on a Summer's eve,
After a ramble on the Surrey shore
'Mid pleasant places, which the Railways leave
Between them, not enclosed, nor all built
o'er.
Eh? Screams and shouts advancing in the
rear!
And what? Large packs of children in
full cry,
Each lot close-crowded in a Van, appear
Successive vehicles, cram-full, pass by!
Youth have enjoyed the sunshine and the
green.
(The sun had chanced to smile upon that
day.)
Strange that those sources of delight serene
Can have promoted their prolonged hooray!
Their little hands outttuttering kerchiefs wave;
Their tiny throats keep up a ceaseless cheer,
Stronger than tea though nought their lips to lave
They 've had, at banquets innocent of Beer.
From School, Endowed or Union, riding out,
Their pleasure could no explanation lack.
But what can cause those little ones to shout.
In transports wild, now when they 're going back?

"The Straight Tip."
And bawl,
joy and gratitude to show.
An aw, ter joy an gratitue to sow.

IT is difficult to realise that we are in Ireland. The few natives we
meet speak with a decidedly Scotch accent. They are politeness
itself, and, judging from my very slight acquaintance (of twenty
minutes' duration) with a resident farmer, I should say that each of
the inhabitants, if they resemble this gentleman, would leave even
our host himself very little chance of winning the prize for courtesy
and hospitality. The superior residents on the coast here seem, as
far as I can gather in the above-mentioned space of twenty minutes,
to be partly engaged in farming, and partly interested in some
sort of shipping trade. For example, this farmer, a considerable
landed proprietor here, is walking about his fields, watching his men
at work, and, at the same time, keeping a bright look out for one of
his trading vessels which ought to have arrived by now. He tells
us of other farmers in the district equally interested with himself
in the shipping trade. From this I expect to see other farmers posted
about on the hills with telescopes,—a reaping-hook in one hand, and
a binocular in the other. Their business is divided between sheep
and ships, tilling and tillers; in fact, they seem to me to be Nautical
Agriculturists, or, to coin a mixed term, "Nauticulturists."
Happy TJiought.—It was these people who invented the expres-
sion ploughing the seas."
Occasionally, when a labourer comes up and addresses his master,
always most respectfully, I remark a slight admixture of Irish
brogue, as evident yet as subtle as the flavour of shalotte in a
craftily-prepared salad. The man touches his forehead where the
brim of nis hat ought to be, and wants to know sometliing about
what's to be done to the walls of an outbuilding.
"They 're just to be whitewashed," says our friend the fanner.
"That's what I told 'urn, Sir," returns the man, emphatically;
"but they're waiting to know what colour ye'11 have it white-
washed."
No one enjoys this more than the master himself.
After a good deal of dawdling, we arrive at the Druidical pile.
This sounds like the name of a new sort of carpet. I say this to
CBAYLKY. He appears hurt, resenting the observation as a slight
on himself and the Druids. Of course, KILLICK laughs. If KTT.T.TCK
had been annoyed, CHAYLEY would have laughed. Our host pre-
serves a placid expression of puzzled neutrality. The "pile in
question consists of one huge block of stone, supported by four huge
blocks. That is all.
Our host says, "There it is!" as if he had expected it to have gone
away before we came. CHAYLEY puts up his eye-glass, and. with his
head very much on one side, regards it with admiration and awe.
"This," he says, speaking more to himself than to us, as if he were
two members of an Archaeological Society, and one was giving the
other a confidential lecture on the subject—" This," he says, in a
tone of melancholy reminiscence, "was an altar, on which the Druids
used to offer up human sacrifices." He is very sad over it, as though
he had been present under compulsion years ago at one of their
festivities, and had regretted it ever since.
We all regard the Druidical pile with pathetic interest. I feel
that if we only remain here long enough, we shall yield to a Druidical
impulse, join hands, and gravely perform some solemn impromptu
dance round the Druids' altar, which, by the way, is situated only
a few yards from the drawing-room window of our friend the
Nautical Farmer's house, a building quite in keeping with the mixed
character of the owner's business; as. but for the undeniable farm-
house surroundings, it might be easily mistaken for a Coast-Guard
station, specially as there is an old painted figure-head of a ship
fixed up, as though keeping guard near a side-door.
KILLICK breaks the silence. He simply says "Bosh!"
"What is 'bosh' ?" retorts CRAYLEY, inquisitorially. He is look-
ing away from KILLICK, and apparently addressing some being in the
air who is not quite so invisible as to escape the penetrating power
of his eyeglass.
"Why. this," says KILLICK, nodding his head towards the Druids'
Stone. It's no more a Druids' altar than I am."
"It has been here for thousands of years," replies CRAYLEY, more in
anger than in sorrow, though there is just a tinge 4f the same sad,
regretful tone which had characterised the first part of his archaeo-
logical lecture; "and how the stones could ever have been placed in
that position, except by some superhuman force, is a puzzle to
everyone."
"Bah!" ejaculates KILLICK, sniffing disdainfully. "I dare say
the farmer and his men placed them there themselves."
"Oh I I can hardly think that," says our host, in his most con-
ciliatory manner. "You see they are exactly opposite his front-
door."'
"No accounting for taste," returns KILLICK. "Why, he's got
the old figure-head of a ship there! Look!"
"There is a family history attached to that; I heard it from
the proprietor himself," observes our host, quietly, as if KHXICK
was now venturing on delicate ground, and he, ALELLEVIIXE, was
the Nautical Farmer's family solicitor, entrusted with all his
secrets. Our host informs us that there is more than meets the
eye in this old figure-head. It reminds me of a timber-yard near
either Vauxhall or the Suspension Bridge, I forget which, where there
used to be, and perhaps where there still is, a collection of these
curious old figure-heads, secondhand, I believe, and I can't help
wondering if the Nautical Farmer had fallen in love with one of
them, and brought it away with him to Larne, as a memento of his
first visit to London.
Happy Thought (for a ballad).—The Farmer and the Figure-head.
KILLICK only sniffs, and I ask, being tired of shore, if it wouldn't
be as well to return to the yacht? When I come out to yacht for
a few days, I count every moment on shore (except when in search of
provender) as so much time wasted.
I can always be on shore, but I can't always be at sea. MELLEVLLLE
can be where he likes, so can CEAYLEY. KILLICK is engaged in some
mysterious business, the exact nature of which no one, not even his
most intimate friends, has been able to ascertain ; but our host informs
me, apart, that it is something that keeps him constantly going about in
underground railways, and coming up suddenly, like a demon sprite
in a Pantomime, out of various subways at different points of the
London suburbs. Somehow, the Boss surmises, as KTT.T.TCK is specially
busy just before Christmas time, that it is some trade connected with
the manufacture of cracker-bonbons, and he is not quite sure that it
isn't the printing of the mottoes to the crackers, and perhaps writing
them, too. "It must, you know," concludes MELLEVILLE, who was a
Wrangler of his year at Cambridge, and a great hand at abstruse
calculations—" It must be a very lucrative business, as, if you con-
sider the population of London, and the demand for crackers and
bonbons, each of which must have a motto, you can soon arrive at
what his labour must be, what an industry it is, and what a fortune
it ought to bring in."
"Then," I conclude, "KELLTCK is very rich."
"Well—not exactly very rich," replies our host, considering the
problem, and pausing as he solves a few equations (x representing
KILLICK'S income)— No," he goes on decisively, having evidently
settled the equation to his own satisfaction—" No; yon see there's
such a competition in crackers and motto-bonbons. Still, he's very

well off. A very nice fellow,—with his peculiarities." he adds
kindly, to which I respond with a deliberate nod. Asking myself
afterwards what this deliberate nod meant,—for I was conscious of
meaning a great deal by it, if I could only put it into words, as Puff
did Lord Murleigh's,—I come to the conclusion that my nod was
intended to express a compassionate feeling on my part for
the unfortunate KILLICK'S "peculiarities," which I take to be
'' failings." My nod implies a compliment also to MELLEVILLE as
being free from KILLICK s peculiarities; in fact it is complimenting
him on not being KILLICK, while at the same time it recognises our
own moral and intellectual position, MELLEVILLE'S and mine, as
superior to anything to which anybody with KILLICK'S failings can
attain . . . and so, on the whole, my nod of assent to MELLEVILLE'S
remarks must be the result either of idiotic self-complacency, or of
the consciousness of moral superiority. Which? The latter for choice.
"But," adds MELLEVILLE. after a short pause, as if he had been
revising his opinions for publication. "he has a very nice voice, and
understands music thoroughly." From either a self-complacent or
morally superior point of view. I have no difficulty in admitting so
much in KILLICK s favoxir, and again I assent with a deliberate nod.
MELLEVILLE pauses a minute, and then, looking round to see if
"the subject of this present memoir" is anywhere near,—but he
isn't; he is descending the hill and having a contradiction match
with CHAYLEY,—MELLEVILLE adds, "He writes the words of songs
himself occasionally, and publishes them."
"Good words'( " I ask. accidentally giving the name of a maga-
zine. (Fancy a song of bad words" only !!)
"Well—pretty well," replies our host, assuming an air of fairly
indulgent criticism. "You know it doesn't much matter what the
words are to songs, as one seldom hears them; but it so happened
that I read two or three, and I couldn't help being struck by their
strong resemblance to the style of the mottoes in the Christmas
crackers. And that's why"
But here KILLICK and CRAYLEY join us. They are serious and
silent. KILLICK is whistling to himself, evidently for his own
private delectation, and CRAYLEY is humming. There has been
evidently a difference of opinion. The drop-curtain, to put it
dramatically, has descended on some sort of a situation, and this
humming and whistling is the music in the entr'acte. We all
proceed, over very slippery sea-weed, to re-embark in the gig.

FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.
THE publication by certain journals, and quite recently by the
Daily Telegraph, of full lists of "distinguished visitors at the
watering-places at home or abroad is a benefit for which the hard-
working man who has been through the London Season, and who is
still undecided as to where he shall take his holiday, cannot be too
thankful. Fancy meeting all those people over again when he
wants to obtain a thorough change and something like rest! And
as the area of such and such sea watering-place or sulphur watering-
place, or whatever other medicinal kind of watering-place it may
be, cannot be very extensive, the infliction is worse than London,
as you are bound to meet your dear friends and charming acquaint-
ances on the eternal parade, or at the monotonous baths or drinking-
fountains, or pier or gardens, or assembly-rooms or etdbUssement.
The list at once tells him what place to avoid.
The regular stereotyped resortsof the Illustrious and the Fashionable
are real blessings to those who want to Bohemianise a bit, and to get
away, for awhile at least, from the humbug of our veneered town life.
But fancy the really blessed state of that individual who, having
read the entire list through, from Princes and Princesses to Dukes
and Duchesses, and then to Lords NOODLE, DOODLE, and GRIZZLE,
and so down to the Mr. and Mrs. DUMMIE, and the HANGEBON Family,
can decide upon selecting this fashionable watering-place as the place
where he can spend a happy holiday because he knows none of the
people named in the list, and, above all, doesn't want to!" How
blessed is he, and only he" Let the Grand Old Poet turn this
into verse for the next Nineteenth Century.

HOW IT WAS DONE.
"The compiler of the Hebrew text was a Polish, Russian, or German Jew.
. . . There were no less than four or five persons engaged in the production
of the forgery."—Dr. GINSBURO'S Keport on Mr. SHAPIRA'S Afamtscript
of Dtttteronomy.
SAYS AAKON to MOSES, " Mankind is very dull;
A learned man may be a dupe, a scholar s oft a gull.
I think we might the sarants sell,
Lead pundits by the noses.
I guess the game would pay us well."
No doubt it would," says MOSES.
Says AARON to MOSES, "A Manuscript of, say
B.C. 800, is a thing that really ought to pay.
That Moabitish stone has filled
The world with wild ' supposes.'
How with our 'find' it would be thrilled!"
"Ah! wouldn't it!" says MOSES.
Says AARON to MOSES, "The text of Deuteronomy,
Written on ancient leathern scrolls— skill matching with economy—
SHAPIRA—some invention quick,
(Romance on zeal imposes)—
I really think't would do the trick."
"Yes! Done with you!" says MOSES.

That million will not come this way.
Learning our dodge discloses.
Archaic forgeries don't pay."
"No; hang it all!" says MOSES.
UN'APPY 'AMPSTEAD!
AT last the state of Hampstead Heath has been brought home, so
to speak, to the Authorities. Mr. Punch for two years has spoken
on behalf of the Public generally, and those equestrians particularly
who, weary of the social hollowness of Rotten Row, Our Only Hide,
walk their horses northwards, in anticipation of a pleasant canter
over the heath, which means the enjoyment of pure air and healthy
exercise, and, when you pause for breath, a lovely panoramic
prospect.
Well, there's the pure air—not even the Board of Works can fine
anyone for taking more than his share of that,—and there's the
Isvely panoramic prospect which ambitious builders have not yet been
able to shut out.—they '11 do it gradually as much as they possibly
can, and we shall have to take a bird's-eye smoky view of so much of
the distance as is not cut off by the outlines of the houses, over roofs,
androwsof chimney-pots,—but where is "The Hide?" Where? In two
divisions,—not easy to find,—one being pretty good, though the expres-
sion "no great shakes" would not strictly apply to it.—and the other
part an up-and-down-hill or rocky-mountain sort of place—soh-itur

"Board of Works "—(what Works f)—during the entire season. It
was nearly as bad last year when Mr. Punch first drew attention to
it. Is the Board of Works as deaf as a deal Board, or is it trying to
imitate the masterly inaction which characterises the arrangements
made for the convenience of the Public and of the immediate neigh-
bourhood by the Guardians of Mud-Salad Market?
However, last week we read in the Daily Telegraph, which gave
it the prominence it deserved, the following case:—
"RIDING ON HAMPSTEAD HEATH.—Mr. DAVID SPENCER, a gentleman
living in Loudoun Road, St. John's Wood, appeared at Hampstead Police-
Court yesterday, to answer a summons taken out by the Metropolitan Board
of Works, charging him with unlawfully riding a horse on the turf on
Hampstead Heath, on a part other than those places set apart for that purpose
by the Metropolitan Board of Works. Mr. J. COLLMAN, from the Solicitors'
Department of the Board, prosecuted. JOSEPH WINTER deposed that on
June 28 he was in the employ of the Metropolitan Board of Works as an
assistant-constable on Hampstead Heath. About 7'40 P.M. that day he saw
Defendant riding a horse on the turf close by the Ride. Witness went to him,
and told him he was breaking the bye-laws, to which Defendant replied,
'Why don't you make the Ride better'(' He then went on the turf again for
about a hundred yards. Witness once more went to him, and Defendant
said, 'You should make the Ride better, and I should not go on to the turf.'
Witness had to get the assistance of a police-constable before Defendant
would give his name and address. Sometimes Defendant was on the turf five
yards from the Ride, and sometimes three. Defendant denied that he was
on the turf at all."
Defendant denied that he was "on the turf" at all. Quite right:
he wasn't prosecuted as a betting man, and the Great Leviathan him-
self would find it next to impossible to be on the turf were he to take
his stand on Hampstead Heath. Mr. SPENCER goes on, and tells the
Magistrate that—
"He was on a beaten track or path, quite bare, that ran by the side of the
Ride, and was riding there because on tne Hide itself there was a number of
very big flint stones, which would cut a horse's legs to pieces. He had come
from the Upper Ride, which was in a very good state, on to this portion,
where there were not only flint stones as big as a man's fist, but a lot of loose
sand, into which the horse sank up to the fetlock joints. Mr. FLETCHER
remarked that the Ride was in a shocking state, and asked if nothing was
going to be done to it. Mr. HOCOH; the Chief Heath Constable, said £1,400
had been expended on it, but he admitted the accuracy of Defendant's descrip-
tion of the state of the Ride, of which he had received frequent complaints.
GILES, 391 8, corroborated the evidence against Defendant, and also the
Defendant's statement as to the Ride. Mr. FLETCHER said the Bench would
dismiss the summons as the Board did not keep the Ride in a proper state.
Mr. ( o i.i.ii \ N urged that a clear infringement of the bye-laws had been
proved. Mr. FLETCHER then ordered Defendant to pay 2». costs, remarking
that the Bench thought his case a hard one."
If £1,400 spent on it has only succeeded in making it so dangerous,
what would another £lj400 have done for it, if laid out in the same
manner? Evidently, it would have been an utterly impossible
place; but so far, safe, as nobody would even have tried to ride there.
It is the Board that ought to be had up before Mr. FLETCHER, and
not the ill-treated equestrian, whom Mr. FLETCHER very properly,
justly, and sensibly_dismissed with a nominal tine of two shillings,
as he thought the case a hard one, and the Ride still harder. Mr.
Punch wifl have a few more suggestions for the Board of Works,
which he shall be most happy to re-christen the " Board of Good
Works," on the very first opportunity. By the way. had the Board
of Works anything to do with the Regent's Park Ride—such as it
was—which was done away with this last Season?

should walk on my hind legs sometimes—I can, having once been a

peripatetic philosopher like me wants to see and not be seen. I see
more than the astutest detective. For who bothers about a dog?
Mud! I 'm a connoisseur in mud, worse luck! Exchanged notes
on the subject with a pig once. He was not in it, never having been
in London. Told him of fifty different kinds of London mud with
fifty distinct bouquets. He grunted as enviously as a poor toper at
the description of the glories of a rich bon vivant's wine-cellar. I
painted Seven Dials on a sloppy night! He looked like a Pig Peri
peeping into an unattainable Porker's Paradise. I outlined Billings-

Then envy dimmed his eager eye,
Relaxed his caudal knot;
And with one long-drawn ventral sigh,
He turned and fled the spot.
Excuse a dog's doggerel. Prose was not equal to the occasion.
Are men like-minded with pigs? A wet day in London puts a
decent hog-pen to the blush. Wish I could do arrangements in

peaches in London's chief market—save the mark!—P. G. might as
well take a stroll in a swampy brickfield or an ill-kept straw-yard.
Trimness and rose-scents above, muck and malodorousness below.
That's Civilisation—in London.
Civilisation from a canine point of view! Don't sniff. Cynical?
Not at all. Dogs are not cynical, though puppies—human ones—arc.
But Civilisation has queer aspects when looked at closely. People
with their heads in the air overlook all sorts of absurdities and
abuses and anomalies, or accept them tacitly as inevitable matters of
course. Look at the state of certain of the main City thoroughfares
at the present time. Or of some of the suburban roads. Up,"
miles of them, week after week, to the dismal discomfort of every-
body—from drivers to dogs. All day in the City roads are blocked,
while leisurely Contractors loiter over jobs that should be done in
carefully-arranged detail with the greatest possible despatch.
If some sooty foreign Effulgency were to be welcomed, the electric
light and night-shifts would promptly be called into play. But
when it's only the convenience, comfort, and cash of tens of
thousands of citizens that are concerned, Bumble dawdles and
bungles on, ignoring management, and cutting Science dead. And
the citizens grumble and submit. Set up a fuming Witch's Cauldron
in Cheapside that wafts foul-smelling asphyxia from end to end, fill
the Strand with dust clouds, as from a million door-mats violently
banged at once, block Fleet Street with stone-piles, mud-heaps, and
scaffold-poles, keep the dirty chaos up for six weeks at a stretch,
and what does Civilisation say? At any rate, she does nothing.
Take a Hansom to your Suburban home, say at Brixton. Cabby has
to make detour after detour till he loses his way—and his temper—
entirely. A barrier of boards, a Gehenna of flaring gas-flames, and
a howling warder stop the way again and again and again. I 've
followed—out of curiosity—a cursing Cabby and a frantic passenger
passing in this way through miles of strange streets, and left them
furiously fighting over the fare at the end of the journey. And why?
Because Bumble is a bumptious blunderer, and Britons—notwith-
standing loudly-shouted lyrical denials—are slaves. Slaves to despotic
officialism, and blind Use and Wont.
Civilisation indeed! Give one of your philosophers, or journalists,
or Inspectors of Nuisances a dog's day of time and a dog's power of
observation, and he '11 knock holes in Civilisation in a way that will
surprise you. That is, if he be not smitten with the judicial—and
judicious—blunders of, say, a District Surveyor, after a bottle of
champagne and a peculiarly careful hand-shake from an interested
party.
Wuff! Civilisation wants looking into with a keener eye than
that of your ordinary District Surveyor. A decent dog's, for example.

Nemesis stern, if slow, o'erlooking naught,
Scoring the debts of each unthrifty year
To exact the utmost. Foolish Haunter, caught
By studied smile and calculated leer,
Or pseudo-Psyche glance, softly severe
Of the sham ingenue,—that master-spell
Which lures some dupes who bolder sirens fear";
That round-eyed clear regard which can dispel
Or answer lingering doubts so eloquently well.
Poor thralls of footlight Florizels; by them
The immitigable penalty is paid.
The harpy-hearted sirens these condemn
To hours by shame and anguish bitter made,
By hope unlit, by pleasure unallayed.
When the last lurid spark dies out from lust,
When the last feeble shred of faith's decayed,
Dead beyond all removal, life is dust
By rapture unillumined and unsustained by trust.

A SONG OF SOUTHWOLD.
"East Aiiglia provides ample room for excursionists and for those who flee
from their presence. . . . Southwold, nt the head of Sole Bay, is a delightful
place."—Daily Newt.
I CAN lie on my back and look up at the sky,'
And I see the swift sea-gulls sail solemnly by;
While I 've nothing to think of but what there's for lunch,
And how yonder fair face should be pictured in Punch.
There is fish to be eaten—although, with a frown,
I Hud out that the best of it goes up to town:
Yet with heartfelt delight will the epicure say,
He is simply sublime is the shrimp of Sole Bay!
There is little to do; I can go for a sail,
And I try to catch fish, and most probably fail.
So I lie down again, and this time with a pipe,
And feel thankful that country greengages are ripe.
There's the Common, where young men and maidens can play
That eternal Lawn Tennis from dawning of day;
As they brandish the rackets, and struggle, and run,
I 've the best of the game looking on at the fun.
Or I wander to Walberswick, place of delight
To the artists who paint it from morning till night;
But I sit on the pier and I relish the view,
Without messing my fingers with cyaniue blue.
Little Southwold 's the place to get rid of black Care,
Which "post eguitein sedit" let HORACE declare;
There are no town amusements, but swift the time passes,
By wild wavelets "iro\v<t>\oia/3oio 9a\iaai\s,"
* Of course he can, there is nothing very wonderful in this. If our
esteemed Contributor had told us how he lay with his face downwards, and
had then looked up at the sky, we should hare preferred it. As it is. ail our
poetic contributors in the country appear to be doing the same thing. All
describe themselves as "lying on their backs." Very prosaic. Evidently
they haven't taken out their poetic licences this year. Unless they 're not
out of town at all, and then it doesn't matter where they lie.—By Envious
Editor who can't get away.

Subjects and Titles.—The most popular stories at merry Yule-Tide
are those dealing with the more violent kinds of crimes and the
gloomiest of ghost-stories. The narrative of a carefully-contrived
assassination always attracts numerous readers. The first essential
is to get a good title, which should be startlingly attractive. We
suggest then the following:—" The Doom of Dr. Deadset." "The
Crime of St. Anne's Crypt." "The Hangman's Pupil." "The
Death, in Avenue Terrace." "Mrs. Poison's Soar-ding-Home."
".Found Dead; or, The Secret of Laurence's Dancing Academy."
"Mike's Mate; or, The Forgotten Murder of Monks-Mummery"
is'long, but attractive. If the story is to deal with high life. Lord
Leonard's Legacy sounds well, but requires some such rider as,
Or, the Rope of Newgate, to give it proper pungency.
If murder is discarded in favour of horrors, then the title should
be startling and mysterious. Here is a short list which will be

'The Monster of Murdoch Manor."
Opening Sentence.—This is all important. The cover and the title
of the work attract the casual bookstall-reader, but the initial line of
tvpe usually determines the question whether the book shall be
bought or not. A very popular story a few years ago commenced
with the rather startling announcement :—
"The murderer paused in his ghastly work."
It matters little what follows so long as interest is immediately
created. The stories, in fact, can take care of themselves. Thus such
sentences as the following may be recommended with confidence:—
1. "Dead! And I am chained to him!" gasped RUPEBT, on
awaking in the wood from his terror-swoon
2. The ship was sinking when the half-murdered Marchioness
reached the deck
3. As RALPH commenced to burn the will hurriedly, he saw that
the widow of the dead man had entered the family vault, and was
watching him
4. The Jury returned with their verdict
5. "I thought so!—as I am an Analytical Chemist, the coffee con-
tains _poison! This, then, accounts for the Major's sudden death!"
6. The two enemies both tried to reach the cord attached to the
safety-valve of the balloon, when
Taking the above as models, tales may be easily fitted to suit them.
All that the Author has to do is." to try back." For instance, in
No. 1 he will have to work up to the situation of a man finding him-
self chained to a dead companion in a forest. Perhaps they were
prisoners who had escaped. If so, how did they get into gaol—and
now did they get out? Then, in No. 2, how came the Marchioness
to be half-murdered, and under what circumstances did she find
herself in a sinking ship? In No. 3, why was RALPH burning the
will in the family vault—and what was his relationship to the dead
man. and his widow? Both Nos. 4 and 5 may relate to a murder of
a mysterious character. In the last, two enemies are struggling in a
balloon—why are they struggling, why enemies, why in a balloon?
If a practised Author puts these questions to himself and answers
them, he will find that he has half-a-dozen genial stories ready to
hand admirably suited for family reading round the Christmas fire.
General Hints.—Having title and initial sentence, the next thing
to obtain is a good "index to contents." The story should be divided
into Books, each having an attractive heading. Four Books are gene-
rally sufficient, and should form a series. Take the idea of a river
such as the Mississippi for instance. Book I. in this case would be
'' Before the Falls!r> Book II.," Shooting the Rapids!" Book IE.,
"In the Whirlpool!" and Book IV., "Smooth Water!" Or the
notion of a campaign may be adopted. Here, Book I. would be,
"Before the Battle!" and the others respectively, "In the Enemy's
Camp!" "The Forlorn Hope !" and " V<e Victis!" This last story
would, so arranged, have a tragical conclusion; but should the
Author wish his tale to '' end happily," he would of course change'' V<e
rictis!" to " Peace at Last!"
Each Book should have its proper number of Chapters, all with
suggestive titles. For instance, The Old Clock turns Traitor!"
"Only a Glass of Water!" "Arrested!" and many others of a simi-
lar character would be found useful. But, perhaps, the shortest way
is to give a skeleton story to act as model for others. Say it contains
four Books, each having four Chapters, and that the key-note is given
in the opening sentence,i" The drowning man still defied his assassin
in the moonlight."
THE DARK DEED OF DEADMAN'S DINGLE.
BOOK I. AIR !—Chapter 1. The Murder near the Brook! Chap. 2.
Lucy's Lover fails to keep his Appointment! Chap. 3. Detective
DOWTEH'S Excursion! Chap. 4. Arrested on Suspieion!
BOOK II. EABTH !—Chapter 1. The Pistol is found in the Fernery!
Chap. 2. DOWTEE'S Note-Book! Chap. 3. Retained for the Defence!
Chap. 4. The Magistrate's Decision!
BOOK III. FIRE!—Chapter 1. LUCY receives a mysterious Visitor!

BOOK IV. WATER!—Chapter 1. "When Thieves quarrel!"
Chap. 2. The Condemned Cell! Chap. 3. LUCY learns at last the

is—to write it.

FROM OUE PRIVATE BOX OF BOOKS.
MARLOWE'S Faustus and GOETHE'S Faust form the third volume
of MORLEY'S Universal Library, brought out by Messrs. GEORGE
ROUTLEDGE AND SONS, the first having been SHERIDAN'S Plays, and
the second, Plays from MOLIEBE, adapted by such eminent English
Dramatists as DRYDEN, VANBBTJGH, WYCHEBLY, FIELDING, and that
slyest old dog of all the collies that ever lived, COLLET CIBBER.
They are most useful reprints, good type, and portable.
Professor MOBLEY, who ought to be named Professor More-and-
MOB-LEY from the amount of work he undertakes, gives us, as the
latest instalment of the Macmillan series of handy biographies,
Richard Brinsley Sheridan, by Mrs. OLIPHANT, who, writing, of
course, well and brightly throughout, is only thoroughly successful
in her account of SHEBIDAN'S domestic life. This part of the mono-
graph is admirably done; but, in her treatment of his dramatic work
andof his theatrical career, Mrs. OLIPHANT fails, either from lack of
appreciation, or of practical experience; and again, her treatment
of nis political career leaves much to be desired. Mr. Sam Welter's
opinion that an abrupt conclusion, is the great art of letter-writing,
because it makes the reader wish "as there was more of it," does
not hold good as regards the biography of such a meteoric character
as RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN.
To return to the Plays of MOLIERE by eminent adapters of the
Restoration period, Professor MOBLEY has taken good care that if the
dialogue is a bit wearisome to readers of modern Plays in "LACY'S
Edition" (chiefly studied by Amateurs in search of "some tiling
likely to suit us ), it shall at least be free from unnecessary offence,
and this he has managed without any Podsnapian Bowdlerism, and
yet with due regard to the blushes of " the young person," who will
probably (we tried it on two) get tired of Sir Martin Marr-all in
about a quarter of an hour, and simply remark, as she lays down the
book and thanks you for nothing, " I never read MOLIERE in the
original, but this must be a very bad translation." We didn't unde-
ceive that young person: it was JOHN DBYDEN'S.
Then we tried the Plain Dealer on another student of the modern
Drama who knew nothing of WILLIAM WYCHERLY except his name,
and he also thought it was a poor translation of a play he had heard
a good deal about, and expressed his opinion that the entire collection,
in which he could never so far interest himself as to take more than
a cursory dip into it, was probably a lot of rieccs that had been
refused bv Managers. These standard Comedies are certainly not
light reading, and without skilful condensation might be very neavy
acting.
Number five of Professor More-and-MoR-LEY's series is to be
RABELAIS' Oargantua and the Heroic Deeds of Pantagruel. The aid
of Professor Podsnap, and Drs. Bawdier and Barlow must surely be
invoked before Henry Sandford and Tommy Merton can take it
home and read it to Susan Sandford and Mary Merton. The
experienced Editor, however, has in his manifesto already declared
that he "intends to respect that change in the conventions of Society
which excludes now from our common acquaintance certain plain-
nesses of thought and speech once honestly meant, and honestly
allowed." Plainnesses indeed! they are downright uglinesses,
deformities, spots on the Shakspearian sun, and foul blots on the
fun and humour of the Dramatists of the Restoration.
"The use and beauty of old monuments," says Professor More-
and-MoB-LEY, "are, surely, separable from their dust and dirt."
This, as a canon of literary and dramatic revival, seems to recom-
mend itself to public judgment, but in historical resuscitations, such

as Mr. .FA M KH GAIBDNER is engaged in in
his Letter! and Papers of the Reign of
Henry the Eighth, as Preserved m the
Public Record Office, it must not be
allowed the slightest influence. We now-
adays are waking up as to how History has
been manufactured; but the public records
of facts, and the private and confidential
letters snowing the secret motives, the in-
tended projects, the intrigues and theperspnal
opinions of the men and women of the time,
these cannot lie, and we are all beginning
to resent having been deceived into giving
the genial, jovial, good-fellowship title of
"Bluff King HAI/' to one of the most
unmitigated scoundrels that ever wore a
crown. ANNE BOLEYN we now learn from
her own mouth was just as bad, but—and
there is much virtue in "but," more than
ever was in ANNE—she suffered for it by
losing her head, but HENRY never once lost
his, for all his temper was diabolical.
Mr. GATRDNER is just the Gairdner who
should be invited to dig in the Vatican
grounds, which are now to be thrown open
to the accredited historians of all countries.
There no doubt, he, being a Gairdner who
calls a spade a spade, would give valuable
assistance in uprooting old and stupid
prejudices.
IN THE CHANNEL.
A REMINISCENCE OF THE GALE8.
I KNEW it!—when I have to cross,
There always are tremendous gales,
The beastly boat will pitch and toss,
A wobbling motion never fails.
E'en as it lies beside the pier,
The steamer's dancing up and down.
Ah me' you never seemed so dear,
Fast-fading lights of Dover town.
"A little fresh," that's what they call
A storm when awful waves we ship;
And then the Captain comes to bawl,
He hopes I 'm well wrapped up this trip.
Hi! Steward! Never leave me, then
You '11 earn a really noble fee.
Oh, good Sir EDWARD WATKIN, when
Shall we be carried under sea!
A VEILED COMPLIMENT.
WE are arriving at a fatal era of " Onlies."
We have Our Only General, Our Only
Admiral, Our Only Ride, Our Only States-
man, Our Only Actor, Our Only Composer,
and therefore it says the greatest things for
the present state of English Literature, that,
in consequence of there being such a plethora
of "Eminent Hands," as THACKERAY called
them, in the Literary World, and such an
embarras dea richesses among novelists, it
should be found absolutely necessary, in
order to avoid "hurting susceptibilities and
creating envies, jealousies, and all uncha-
ritablenesses, to obtain the services of a
distinguished American Man of Letters to
unveil a bust of FIELDING, and to expatiate
on his life and works to FIELDING'S
countrymen.
_ Some years ago we should have had
either DICKENS, who was a careful student
of FIELDING, or THACKERAY, for the cere-
mony, but the latter would probably have
declined the honour, adapting Antony's lines
to the occasion,—" I am no orator as
DICKENS is," and might have added that
he had already sufficiently unveiled not the
bust, but the man himself. "I cannot
offer or hope to make a hero of HARRY
FIELDING," writes THACKERAY; "why hide
his faults, why conceal his weaknesses in a

Brigson. "THERE 's A DEGREE or COMFORT AND REPOSE ABOUT THE MODERN SYSTEM
THAT 's "—(smacks his lips]—" VE'Y 'NJOYABLE!"
cloud of periphrases? Why not show him as he is?" we hear THACKERAY saying while
giving directions to the Sculptor for the bust; "not robed in a marble toga, and draped
and polished in an heroic attitude, but with inked ruffles and claret-stains on his tarnism d
lacea-coat, and on his manly face the marks of good-fellowship, of illness, of kindness, t f
care, and wine."
That is unveiling if you like, and, for ourselves, we should have been content to have^left
it at that, unless we had called in Mr. SALA, the Author of those capital papers on W'illiam
Hogarth, who would not have been a whit behind Mr. RUSSELL LOWELL in " orating," and
who would probably have replied to the invitation with the concluding lines of THACKERAY'S
Essay: "Such a brave and gentle heart, such an intrepid and courageous spirit, I love to
recognise in the manlv, the English HARRY FIELDING."
That Mr. LOWELL has scored sufficiently off his own bat and had his innings, is probably
the reason why he was called upon to take his turn at Fielding. It is part of the game.
But, as we have already said, that an American Author should have been selected for this
function, is the greatest compliment that could have been paid to the crowd of Eminent
Hands representing English Literature at the present time.

ONCE again in the gig, being rowed 'from store to the Creusa.
KTLLICK and CBAYLEY have evidently not had it out yet about the
Druidical Remains as they came down the hill.
KnxiCK, who is of a volatile turn, and to whom a period of more
than three minutes of unbroken silence becomes irksome, begins
humming. Perhaps it is the sequel to the air he was humming when
we re-embarked. His hum has not about it the drone of content-
ment which makes some hums sound like a gentle purr, but it
assumes an air of defiance as he gives it out with his lips closed, and
with his nose in the air; indeed, it strikes me that, as it is performed
louche fermee, somewhat after the manner of the Sailors' Chorus in
L'Afrtcaine, it would be more correct to describe it as with the air
in his nose,—and both descriptions are equally true. His chin is at
a considerable" elevation, so that, as he looks about him sharply, it
seems as if he were challenging anybody within hail with a "Hum-
if-you-dare" kind of tune. CEAYLEY, with his back turned to
KILLICK, as much as his sitting position in the boat will permit, does
not explicitly accept the challenge, but sets up, so to speak, a little
quiet droning business, consisting of disjointed scraps of melodies,
which he doesn't take the trouble to connect even as a medley.
The effect is irritating. It is difficult to interfere and say, " Don't
hum," and the only way appears to be to start an opposition. If I
do this, it occurs to me that our host will bo tired of the whole lot of
us, and will receive a telegram recalling him to town immediately on
business, which will necessitate, so he will tell us, his giving up his
yachting this season, and then, when the present party is broken up,
he will start afresh with new and more pliable materials.
Happy Thought.—Don't hum.
KILLICK, stopping short, says decidedly, as if he had had a private
and confidential inspiration on the subject, "We shall have a tine
day to-morrow."
Why ?" asks CBAYLEY. At all events, the humming is over, but
CHAYLEY'B " Why?" is uttered in just the manner which KILLICK is
sure to resent.
"Well," replies KILLICK, in a tone implying that the meteorological
evidence for his previous statement is so clear as to be irresistible to
any but a born fool. I feel that his tone does convey all this,—
"Well, just look at the sky."
CEAYLEY is looking at the sky through his eyeglass sideways, and
his other eye is round the corner, down indirectly, but certainly, on
KnxiCK. A guttural inarticulate ejaculation, which might be a
compliment from a Fiji Islanderj but is uncommonly like an insult
from a member of a civilised society, is the only answer he deigns to
give. I think if our host, who continues to appear entirely absorbed
in his steering, oould only pitch them both overboard to finish their
differences in the water, he would gladly dp so; as it is, he only
shouts earnestly and cheerily to the crew, Give way, my men! "as if
encouraging them to reach the yacht as quickly as possible. But
what excellent advice (which we are so constantly hearing, and on
which I have before remarked) to both KILLICK and CEAYLEY, and
not only to them, but to all obstinate arguists, to "Give way, my
men,"—for the more you give way, the easier and the pleasanter and
the quicker is the progress, each minding his own business, and all
"giving way" together.
Happy Thought.—The above is quite a little Sailors' Sermon.
Good title for book, "Sailors' Sunday Sermons. Now on Sail.'
"Safe to be fine," says KILLICK, shortly, apparently settling the
weather, bnt really provoking further discussion.
"Much more likely to rain," says CEAYLEY, disdainfully.
"Not a chance of it," retorts KILLICK. Double retorts are
dangerous things.
"I should say it was sure," retorts CEAYLEY.
"Way enough!" shouts our host to the crew, as we glide up along-
side the Creusa, and then he adds, with an air of great relief, which
whether on account of having stopped his guests at a dangerous
point, or of having brought us up safely without bumping the yacht
I can perfectly appreciate, "Now, then, take care how you get out.'
KILLICK is first up the companion, and quickly, too, as if he sus-
pected some sinister intention on the part of CEAYLEY, who, how-
ever, waits till the last but one, the last being always the Commo-
dore himself, that is, MELLEVTLLE, who always acts on the principli
of sticking to the ship or the boat, whichever he may be in, until he ha:
seen everybody safely off. True gallantry is the mark of a British
Sailor, whether professional or amateur.
We are received by the Captain, who cheerfully salutes us indi-
vidually, as much as to sav, "Glad to see you back again, Gentle-
men; was afraid you wouldn't return safely."
"Nowt" says the Commodore—it is settled that that is MELLE-
ILLE'S title—" Now, what would you like to do P"
I should not be surprised were KLLLICK to take off his coat, and
reply, "Fight!" but he doesn't, and only says, " Bathe." As this
will evidently be a cooling process, the Commodore assents at once.
3o do I. CEAYLEY, however, remarks that it is not the sort of bathing
le cares for, and therefore will not join us.
"Why," KILLICK remonstrates, but not gently, always pro vokingly,
'this is the very place."
"I dare say it is, but not for me," answers CEAYLEY, contem-
ilating the sky.
"He likes bathing at Boulogne," exclaims KILLICK, turning to us.
I know what he likes—beginning in two inches of water, and then
boldly venturing out into a depth of at least four feet. Ugh!"—
and he pretends to shudder at the idea.
"Well," replies CEAYLEY, evidently nettled, "I don't see why
! shouldn't prefer Boulogne—though you haven't got the right pro-
nunciation, by the way—especially as I have not sufficient confidence
in my swimming to plunge into deep water."
"What, can't swim! Good Gracious! fancy not being able to
swim!!" and with this exclamation, which seems to express that
;his deficiency in CEAYLEY'S education makes any further oonversa-
ion with him a condescension, KILLICK disappears below.
MELLEVILLE pours oil on the troubled CKAYLEY, and highly corn-
nends him for his prudence in not jumping into deep water, when he
.s uncertain as to whether he will ever come out again.
"Exactly so," says CEAYLEY, quite pleased with himself. His
istimation of MELLEVULE as a clever man has evidently risen
.mmensely in less than a minute. "What's the good of my drown-
ng myself for the sake of a swim?" We both agree that he is quite
right, and that so, inferentially, KILLICK is absolutely wrong. This
verdict of the Court, MELLEVILLE and myself, satisfies CEAYLEY,
who, as it were, gives us his blessing, and bids us bathe and be
liappy. We descend, and presently all, except CEAYLEY, reappear
as acrobats ready to perform the Bounding Brothers, an idea that is
materially assisted by the Captain ordering one of the men to put
down a square bit of carpet for us to stand on when we come out.
Only drum and pandean pipes are wanted to complete the picture.
CEAYLEY is good enough to observe that he envies us; "_the
water," he savs, "looks so delicious, he wishes he were going in."
"Dp 1" says KILLICK, who at the last moment seems as if he were
taking a view of the sea very different from what he did a quarter-
of-an-hour ago, or he would not suggest that his antagonist should
do anything which would promote his enjoyment.
The fact is, there is all the difference between the sort of dreamy
meditation in which, when you have got your clothes on, you regard
the delights of bathing from some such coign of 'vantage as the shore
or a deck, and the contemplation of the same water when you have
no clothes on, and are at such close quarters with it as to practically
make your immediate plunge an imperious necessity. It doesn t
look a half, nor a quarter so attractive to you when undressed as it
did before you took your things off. Then the blue sea seems to
invite you with a rippling smile, saying, "Come in! take your boots
off, &c., you are hot and dusty and tired! and here you will be so
cool, so clean, and so refreshed! come!" But, by the time you have
denuded yourself of vour garments, and by that action, and by the
exposure to the winds, have already a trifle cooled and refreshed
yourself, you begin to think whether the sea isn't playing you false
after all. As I stand on the deck at the head of the bathing-ladder,
in a state of acrobatically-attired nature, I own to experiencing this
feeling, and I can't help delaying just to inquire of MELLEVILLE—
who, as he is ordinarily the last to leave the ship when duty demands
his presence, so now is he the first to make the plunge when there
is a probability of danger,—for swim as well as you may, there is a
possibility of danger,—just a chance (at least, so it invariably occurs
to me at the last moment, when retreat is dishonourable) that though
you 've come out of it safe and sound before, yet now this time you
may not, that a conger may get hold of you, or a gigantic sea-weed,
or a cramp, or, in fact, something may happen,—I say I pause to
ask MELLEVILLE, for the reappearance of whose head on the surface
I have been anxiously waiting, "How is it? Cold?" To which he
replies, gaspingly, "Eh? What? Cold? Oh, no! Delicious!!"
and though I am conscious of being the victim of good-natured
deception, and though, if I spoke my mind honestly, I would even
now rather retire and put on my clothes again, and stand with
CHAYLEY as a spectator of the inspiring scene, yet I merely reply,
"Eh? Oh! not cold?" and having previously placed myself as
near as possible to the water, on the lowest bathing-step, where I
can, so to speak, taste a sample of the sea's temperature on my
great toe, I raise my hands in a despairing Waterloo-Bridge-
suicidal attitude above my head, and, like Mr. Sox, in the Farce,
give a last look at the yawning gulf beneath me, and then, unlike
Mr. Sox, I take the great plunge, commit myself to the deep, and I,
too, disappear from CEAYLEY'S gaze. It is only for a second, but it
seems an age. Where have I got to? Shall I meet a conger, or a
dog-fish? How do divers keep their breath so long under water?

If I don't keep my breath—well, evidently I shall lose it—and then?
When am I coming up again? Am I going the wrong way? Am
I going under the keel? Am I going to be sucked in or under, or
oh, no!—light—more lighlr—and np I come once more to breathe the
upper air with all the delight of a prisoner released unexpectedly
from the Bastille. A little of this goes a great way, With no
unhesitating stroke do I make for the steps, and, shaking the drops
off the soles of my feet, climb up for dear life as if pursued by sharks.
It seems years since I was on deck; I almost expect to find things
changed in my absence, as if I were a diving Kip Van Winkle
returned from a visit to the Merman's Cave.
Happy Thought.—Register and patent this note for a Christmas
Book. Evident how much more in keeping would the History of
-R. V. Winkle be if he had gone to sleep under the sea! Winkle,
with something fishy in his nature, his fairy godmother a Peri-
Winkle, and so forth. When I have dried myself like a herring,
and smoked myself, too, I will note this down for future use.
KILLICK and MELLEVILLE are still disporting themselves in the sea
as I go below and resume my usual habits, I mean, habiliments.
Gradually I glow; gradually I feel hungry; suddenly I wish it
was dinner-time; and being quite dressed I am prepared to expa-
tiate to CRAYLEY on the pleasures and advantages of a good plunge
in the sea before dinner.
In the evening we take exercise on deck, then descend, and
CRAYLEY tries to teach us a new game of cards; but as the point of
it seems to consist in his winning every time, KILLICK abuses it, and
a row is imminent, but for the interposition of our host, who suggests
a little music. We have a little music, and then to bed very early,
as we are—hurrah!—to sail to-morrow morning!!

MOSSOO'S DIARY.
THE notable stir made not only across the Channel, but on this
side of it, by the recent appearance of M. MAX O'RELL'S capital little
book, John Bull et son lie, is not to be
wondered at. His facts are not only most
entertaining, but in many instances so
remarkably fresh and original, that the
British reader of average information and
intelligence may be excused for wondering
where on earth he picked them all up.
The following extracts from a certain
private journal may possibly clear up the
mystery. After the high compliment
M. MAX O'RELL has paid to Mr. Punch, by
whom he is quick to note that contempo-
rary topics are treated in a style showing, as he aptly expresses it,
"que I on peut avoir de I'esprit sans etre leste, encore moins grassier,
it is hardly necessary to add that they are put forward in the most
friendly and amicable spirit. French books about England are not
often over-pleasant reading, but such a verdict cannot for a moment
be passed on the brilliant effort of M. MAX O'RELL, of whom, to
repay him in the complimentary language of his own Preface. Mr.
Punch, however critically he be disposed, trusts he may be allowed
to subscribe himself, Quite sincerely,
UN AMI ET ADMIRATEUR.
Monday.—At last! Here am I arrived in England! Of my
journey from Paris by "the direct Continental express route," ria
Boulogne and Thames steamboat to London Bridge—later. I note,
however, by the way, that Ipass at Greenwich the Tower of London
(Tour de Londres), where HENBY THE NINTH was executed by his
seven wives, and where—strange contrast!—the Ministers now
annually dine the Opposition, to celebrate the event in the long
vacations. This information from the Steward, who speaks French.
His accent though is an abomination; but a compatriot of the " fore-
cabin" informs me that he has learnt this at Oxford, where, like all
Englishmen destined for the sea, he has taken his "nautical
degree." The badge of this honour, a gaily-coloured globe, with the
letters L. G. 8. N. C. appended, is fastened round his hat. But, to
proceed. At St. Katherine's, where we land, 1 am met by my English
friend JACK THOMPSON. He is delighted to see me, and I ask him in
a single breath ten thousand questions. He seems to know every-
thing, and I gather information with rapidity. The fearful
deformities of men begrimed with dirt, who seize my baggage like
Vulcans and take it to the shore, interest me.
'Who are they P" I ask.
'Noblemen who have been ruined by ' welching' on the Turf,"
he replies, with great promptness.
'Do they ever reinstate themselves?" I continue.
'Sometimes."
1 But they cease to be Peers?"
'On the contrary—they are the Peers of London Bridge."
We roll along in our "four-wheeler," a species of covered landau,
simple and convenient, introduced by the QUEEX. She makes the
journey to her Chateau Balmoral at Land's End, in the North of
Ireland (20jOOO kilometres) five times a year in nothing else but this
charming "four-wheeler." This is why her crown is displayed
prominently on the back of each.
On our way we pass St. Martin's Baths and Wash-houses, a large
building, like St. Peter's at Rome, with a colossal dome and two
turrets, SPIERS AND POND'S establishment, where the haute noblesse
dine on Guv Faux Day and Bank Holidays, the Monument, to com-
memorate the Plague of Waterloo Place, Buckingham Hospital, and
several other interesting constructions, arriving at 115, Crofton Road,
Bayswater, the Nobleman's establishment in which JACK THOMPSON
has arranged that I shall be received en pension pending my sojourn
in London for 30s. the week, just in time for the dinner of the family.
Everything interests me immensely, and I notice that my host,
who, my friend has confided to me, belongs to one of the oldest
families in England, comes to the front door in his shirt-sleeves and
assists the cab-driver in conveying my luggage up the stairs to my
apartment. This strikes me as patriarchal, and I learn that it is a
grand old Ducal custom in Bayswater, the exclusive quartier of the
High Life, in which I have been particularly solicitous to collect my
insular experiences.
6'30 P.M.—Pending preparations for dinner, I take some notes of
the British Nobleman's family. First I regard the Nobleman
himself. He is a middle-sized, bourgeois-looking man of about
fifty, with a red nose and uncertain gait, wearing slippers, and
smelling of what I at first thought was the English liqueur, gin, but
which JACK THOMPSON informs me is merely a rare sort of Eau de
Cologne, patronised by the Society of the neighbourhood. However,
he bears the ancient name of SPKIGGS, is Hereditary Grand Almoner
to the Archbishop of YORK AND CANTKRBCBY, and, if an accident
should happen to the LORD CHANCELLOR when on Circus, he would be
next in succession to the Woolsack. JACK THOMPSON, who imparts
this information to [me as we descend to the salle-d-manger, also
briefly indicates the remaining members of the household. There is
Madame, her two charming daughters both possessed of fabulous
dots, a gentleman friend from the Stock Exchange, a millionnaire,
proprietor of one of the largest Estates in Shepherd's Bush, and an
Oriental Prince, who, taking the modest name of Mr. CHTNDER
< i r M . has come to England to make a short stay at Bayswater, and
so prepare himself better for the discharge of his future duties as
Viceroy of India. Altogether, 1 note that I am introduced to a
very distingue party.
9. P.M.—The dinner of the English haute noblesse is simple. At
the table of this aristocratic family in Bayswater we have had
Irish Stew and white Plum Pudding. I complain of this austere fare
to JACK THOMPSON, who says it is quite chic. Lord SPBIGGS, I note,
dines still in his shirt-sleeves, and sings morsels of a comic chanson
between his mouthfuls, sometimes rolling under the table and being
replaced. This makes one eager for information as to the tastes
and habits of the aristocratic classes. Here are some items. Many
noble families of Piccadilly live on red herrings and garlic, the only
drink permitted for the Ladies of the household being rum. Some-
times this diet is varied. In the season there is pancake. It is made
of shreds of cabbage, treacle, tea-leaves, bran, boot-leather, pork-
suet, and, after being flavoured with stout and nutmeg, served cold
on soup-plates. It is said to be satisfying, and at five-o clock tea, an
orgy particularly British and insular, is swallowed in large quantities
by voracious Amazons fresh from Rotten Row and Mile End. It is
tnus the English Misses produce their prominent teeth. Much more
information I get from JACK THOMPSON which makes me reflective.
10 P.M.—Have had a discussion with the great City miUionnaire on
the relative value of Money. To illustrate nis theories he borrows a
piece of two shillings and sixpence of me, and goes away suddenly to
catch the hist train for the Stock Exchange. This makes me again
reflective. Talking to the Indian Prince, through the assistance of
JACK THOMPSON, who acts as interpreter, I learn that all Viceroys
of India are expected to swallow a cavalry sword, and do the cobra
and pocket-handkerchief trick, and that he has come to cultivate
these accomplishments under the instruction of a distinguished
"Crammer at Bayswater. He is certainly a peculiar person is
this JOHN BULL. I must write a book about htm.
11 P.M. Having just seen the Duke of CAMBRIDGE pass down
Crofton Road on his wav from Windsor in the dark on a bicycle,
ringing a dustman's bell to announce his approach to the Horse
Guards, I retire to rest wondering at the aplomb of these hardy
islanders. I note, too, that beds in England are filled with hard-
boiled eggs; and this in noble mansions where a stranger pays 30s. for
the week. JACK THOMPSON, through the wall, tells me that it is
"all-right," and that the LORD CHAMBERLAIN stuffs his bolster with
.__"*..'. rm_- __•_ T j_ j • ,_^ i-^ T L.II ---'--^y
SON
paving-stones. This, again, I tind insular. Yes. I shall certainly
turn my notes to account. JOHN BULL is most remarkable, and
ILE full of surprises. More of him to-morrow.
SIB W. V. HAHCOCRT'S idea of a really Happy existence is in a
City of Spirits where there are no Corporations.

TRUTHFUL JOHN TO MADAME FRANCE.
(In the spirit of friendliness and the form of a
celebrated original.)
I MAKE bold to remark—
And my speech shall be plain—
That for policy dark,
And for purposes vain,
Chinamaniac ways are peculiar; and this view
I—politely—maintain.
In this year Eighty-Three
To go in for this fad
Is pure fiddle-de-dee,
And a sight that is sad
Save to those who are really your foes, or, as
friends, are exceedingly mad.
For that Heathen Chinee
Is a hard nut to crack,
As YOU '11 certainly see
If you sail on that tack.
And the worst of it is that, once started, 'tis
hard to slack sail and put back.
"Heads I win, tails you lose,"
JOHNNY PIGTAIL might say.
Common sense would refuse
To proceed in that way.
Fate may play it low down upon France if she
enters the lists with Cathay.
And for what useful end?
Why for none that I see,
And I speak as a friend,
Pray be guided by me.
You will make a faux pas, I am sure, if you
"go for " that Heathen Chinee.
A—political—taste
For such old bric-a-brac,
If indulged in with haste
Shows a plentiful lack
Of discretion. 'Twill prove most expensive, and
put your best friends on the rack.
In the game you propose
/would not take a hand;
We are friends and not foes;
You are great, you are grand;
But the game you are playing just now is a
game I cannot understand.
Which is why I remark—
And my language is plain—
That for policy dark
And for purposes vain
Chinamaniac ways are peculiar, and this view
I make bold to maintain.
"WHAT SEASIDE RESOBT SHALL I CHOOSE FOB MY HOLIDAY?"—
Rather late for the question, but one of Our Sea District-Visitors
answers it by saying " Southend." He tells us that, on arriving
there, he asked where the sea was? and was informed that it was
out at present, but that it would be in again in a few hours. So Our
Sea District-Visitor waited patiently. At last the sea, he was told,
had returned. He sallied forth. He looked straight before him,
then to the right, and then to the left. At last an old inhabitant
aeked him if he had lost anything, and could he direct him any-
where ?" To the sea, if you please," replied the Visitor. The old
man regarded him curiously for a second or so. and then led him to
the Pier. "Walk straight on," said this kindly guide, "as far as
you can go to the Pier-head." "And then," said the Visitor,
''there's the sea, ehP" "No, Sir," replied the Ancient Mariner,
shaking his head, "but there 'a a telescope as they lets out,—it's a
powerful glass,—and, on a clearish day, it brings the sea quite near."
Of course, as Our Sea District-Visitor observes, it is delightful to
have the sea at any distance that suits you,—a very great point on a
blusterous day. "And there's another advantage." adds Our Sea
District-Visitor, "in choosing Southend as a place of resort, you can
go there and back in an hour-and-a-half." Our S.D.V. came back.
THE VERY LATE GALE.—When an Amateur Fructiculturist awoke
next morning, and found all his unripe apples all over the ground,
all his peaches down, his figs scattered, the glass lying about every-
where, his creepers on the ground, his flowers strewn, his young
trees prostrate, and branches off his old ones on the lawn, then he
said to himself, "Now I know what ' a windfall' means. But I had
always associated it with something lucky till now." And he
proposes to write a new dictionary for the use of Fructiculturists.

(Problem 3.) How TO FIND YOUR WAY WESTWARD. (Problem 4.) How TO OET KID OF THIS OBSTRUCTION.
A WET DAY AT THE SEA-SIDE.
WHY does not some benefactor to his species discover and publish
to a grateful world some rational way of spending a wet day at the
Sea-side? Why should it be something so unutterably miserable
and depressing that its mere recollection afterwards makes one
shudder?
This is the first really wet day that we have had for a fortnight,
but what a day! From morn to dewy eve, a summer's day, ana far
into the black night, the pitiless rain has poured and poured and
poured. I broke the unendurable monotony of gazing from the
weeping windows of my Sea-side lodging,',by rushing out wildly and
plunging madly into the rainy sea, and got drenched to the skin both
going and returning. After changing everything, as people Bay but
don't mean, and thinking I saw something like a break in the dull
leaden clouds, I again rushed out, and called on JONES, who has
rooms in an adjacent terrace, and, with some difficulty, persuaded
him to accompany me to the only Billiard Table in the miserable
place. We both got gloriously wet on our way to this haven of
amusement, and were received with the pleasing intelligence that it
•was engaged by a private party of two, who had taken it until the
rain ceased, and, when that most improbable event happened, two
other despairing lodgers had secured the reversion. Another rush
home, another drenching, another change of everything, except the
weather, brought the welcome sight of dinner, over which we fondly
lingered for nearly two mortal hours.
But one cannot eat all day long, even at the Sea-side on a wet day,
and accordingly at four o'clock I was again cast upon my own
resources. I received, I confess, a certain amount of grim satisfac-
tion at seeing BROWN—Bumptious BROWN, as we call him in the
City, he being a Common Councilman, or a Liveryman, or something
of that kind—pass by in a fly, with heaps of luggage and children,
all looking so depressingly wet;—and if he had not the meanness to
bring with him, in a half-dozen hamper, six bottles of his abominable
Gladstone Claret! He grinned at me as he passed, like a Chester
cat, I think they call that remarkable animal, and I afterwards
learnt the reason. He had been speculating for a rise in wheat, and,
as he vulgarly said, the rain suited his book, and he only hoped it
would last for a week or two! Ah! the selfishness of some men!
What cared he about my getting wet through twice in one day, so
long as it raised the price of his wretched wheat?
My wife coolly recommended me to read the second volume of a
new novel she had got from the Library, called, I think, East
Glynne, or some such name, but how can a man read in a room with
four stout healthy boys and a baby, especially when the said baby is
evidently very uncomfortable, and the four boys are playing at leap-
frog? Women have this wonderful faculty, my wife to a remarkable
extent. I have often, with unfeigned astonishment, seen her appa-
rently lost in the sentimental troubles of some imaginary heroine,
while the noisy domestic realities around her have gone on unheeded.
I again took my place at the window, and gazed upon the melan-
choly sea, and remembered, with a smile of bitter irony, how I had
agreed to pay an extra guinea a week for the privilege of facing the
sea!—and such a sea! It was, of course, very low water—it gene-
rally is at this charming place; and the sea had retired to its
extremest distance, as if utterly ashamed of its dull, damp, melan-
choly appearance. And there stood that ridiculous apologv for a
Pier, with its long, lanky, bandy legs, on which I have been dragged
every evening to hear the Band play. Such a Band! The poor
wheezy cornet was bad enough, but the trombone, with its two notes
that it jerked out like the snorts of a starting train, was a caution.
Oh, that poor "Sweetheart." with which we were favoured every
evening! I always pictured her to myself sitting at a window list-
ening, enraptured, to a serenade from that Trombone!
But there's no Band to-night, not a solitary promenader on the
bandy-legged Pier, I even doubt if the Pier Master is sitting as
usual at the receipt of custom, and I pull down the blind, to shut
out the miserable prospect, with such an energetic jerk that I bring
down the whole complicated machinery, and nearly frighten Baby
into a fit, while the tour irreverent boys indulge in a loud gufi'aw.
Thank goodness, on Saturday I exchange our miserable, wheezy,
asthmatic Band for the grand orchestra of the Covent Garden
Promenade Concerts, and the awful perfume of rotten seaweed for
the bracing atmosphere of glorious London. ^N OUTSIDER

SHAKSPEARIAN REMAINS.
OF course the Shakspearian Mayor, and the Shakspearian Vicar,
who cleverly seizes the opportunity for letting the public know how
badly he is off for funds for his Church's restoration, won't allow
SHAXSPEARE'S bones to be exhumed. By the way, a propos of a
certain discussion recently started about burlesquing any work of
SHAKSPEARE'S, we have just received the fourth volume of the new
edition of Sir WALTER SCOTT'S Dryden's Works, brought out by Mr.
WILLIAM PATERSON—" Ho! BLLLT PATEESON !'—of Edinburgh, in
a good solid form and excellent type—quite the type of type for
those who read by lamp-light,—and ably edited by Mr. GEORGE
SAINTSBTJRY. Here we find DRYDEN'S version of SHAKSPEARE'S
Tempest, in which he collaborated with DAVENANT. who had started
the idea, subsequently carried out by "Glorious JOHN," of giving
Miranda a sister Dorinda, bestowing on Caliban a sister, one Mits
Sycorax. adding a Master Hippolito ("heir to the Dukedom of
Mantua"), and a companion. Spirit to Ariel, named "Milcha_";
besides several comic minor characters and a few demons to sing
choruses. Bones of SHAKSPEARE! Glorious JOHN at least made no
bones about disturbing SHAKSPEARE'S literary remains.
Mr. SAINTSBURY calls this work a " Shakspeare Travesty," but we
submit, with all due deference, that this version of The Tempest
(which DHTDEN calls "a Comedy ") was simply a Pantomimic and
Musical Fairy Extravaganza, such as nowadays, with considerable
cutting, might have been produced with great success at the Alham-
bra, or, as a spectacle, at Her Majesty's, or at the Porte St. Martin
as a feerie similar to the Voyage dans la Lune. Glorious JOHN and
Sir WILLIAM DAVENANT seriously thought they were improving on
SHAKSPEARE'S original work in every way, plot, dialogue, effects,
and construction, when they devised their version of The Tempest.
Very far from DHTDEN'S thoughts was any sort of travesty; and this
is so evident from DRTDEN'S Preface, and from the Extravaganza
itself, that DRYDEN'S own Prologue, which, as Mr. SAINTSBTJRY
justly savs, is "one of the most masterly tributes ever paid at the
shrine of SHAKSPEARE," has, in its connection with this work, all
the air of overdone laudation addressed by a flatterer with a present
purpose to serve, to a great man before his face and coram populo,
whose worth he is going to depreciate, and on that depreciation
intends to trade, directly his back is turned.
Glorious JOHN, like the Immortal Bard himself when he played
the courtier to Queen BETSY, could be a " glorious " humbug in any
really indifferent matter involving no sacrifice of principle; and ui
this Preface of his to The Tempest we don't beEeve in his sell-
abnegation when he shrinks from the honour of "joining his imper-
fections with the merits of DAVENANT and SHAKSPEARE." Either he
rated DAVENANT too high, or SHAKSPEARE too low; but he was at
all events obsequiously polite to his collaborates in coupling his name
with that of SHAKSPEARE. It might have been a "travesty had
he burlesqued SHAKSPEARE'S lines and characters, and calledit, out
of compliment to the Court, Vivat Rex; or, a Dry'd'iui after the
Tempest.

She lost the fair fields of Alsace and Lorraine;
She bowed to the Teuton, and then came surcease
From war, and an era of calm and of peace:
So why should the German, with menacing glance,
Still trample the conquered, and menace fair France?
We know how the German's invincible line
Of soldiers keeps ever the watch upon Rhine,
And France has no thought of revenge, though what man,
Born Frenchman, but sighs when he thinks on Sedan.
The atmosphere's peaceful, and hard 'tis to guess
Why thunderbolts issue from Germany's press.
The strong should be merciful,—why should a threat
Bring back to onr minds what we fain would forget?
The German should rest since secure he can feel,
Though ploughshares will never be forged from his steel;
"While France keeps the peace, let the Teuton to-day
Take shame thus the part of the bully to play.

EASTEND-ON-MUD.
(Retracts from the Note-Book of our Coast-District Visitor.)
How to get to Eastend-on-Mud.—Rj one of the dirtiest and most
unpunctual of railways, which starts from a hideous station some-
where in the heart of the City. The terminus in question is now
being enlarged by the addition of some new refreshment-rooms,
intended to be used by Oriental travellers fresh from India and
Australia, who, it is presumed, will defer their long-anticipated visits
to their friends and relations to eat an enticing dainty known
as a " 'am sandwich," and drink a glass of some mvsterious liquid
called "sherry" on reaching the arrival platform. Thus the dusty-
station grub is gradually developing into the dingy-station butterfly.
After leaving London, the line passes through miles of flat marshes,
occasionally nugging the river to afford glimpses of training-ships
and drainage-works, finally emerging at Eastend, after skirting for
a considerable distance an amphibious track which is at high water a
shallow brook, and at low water a muddy ditch. There is an alter-
native route by water, which takes many hours. The steamer starts
from London Bridge. For the convenience of the passengers, it
would be better if it could start from Hanwell.
The Pier.—Said to be the longest in the world. It is very narrow
and rather rickety. It is now under repair. It is supplied with a
tramway, upon which runs (or rather is pushed by a man—half sailor
—half porter) a truck. This truck travels occasionally to the end of
the Pier in search of luggage. When a bandbox is captured, the truck
returns to the Toll-Taker triumphantly. There are many legends
about the building of this immense Pier. The best authenticated is
that it was constructed many years ago by the inhabitants of East-
end-on-Mud, who then made a last desperate and futile effort to
escape from their dreary dwelling-place to the other side of the
river. There is a sort of refreshment-lighthouse at the end of the
structure, where storm-signals are hoisted, and shrimps, sweetstuff.
ovsters, and ginger-beer are sold to the adventurous. It is presumed
that the shrimps and oysters are caught, and the sweetstuff and
ginger-beer manufactured by the lighthouse-keeper, as his com-
munications with the mainland, on account of. his distance from it,
cannot be numerous.
The Bathing.—When you can catch the tide, you may take a dip
from a machine. But you must be on the watch, and seize your
opportunity. The moment the water reaches the shore, dash in. Be
ready, and do not have to delay to finish your toilette de bain, or the
waves will be off and away for about three miles, not to return to
you again for twice as many hours. Once having caught the water,
you can delightfully disport yourself in it—that is to say, if you
don't mind the mud.
The Apartments.—Not unlike the lodgings at Margate or Herne
Bav. However, as Eastend-on-Mud has a great name for its air
said to be invaluable to convalescents, the rooms are generally fur-
nished with a soupfon of some recently-discarded complaint. Thus
the parlours will nave six horse-hair chairs, a table, and the remains
of the chicken-pox: the drawing-room, a sideboard, a piano, and a few
old measles; and the second floor front, a print of the Duke of WEL-
LINGTON, some china ornaments, a cabinet, and all that the last
;enants have left of the whooping-cough.
The Amusements.—Chiefly "shrimps and tea, ninepence." But
there are also a Theatre and a Band. The Theatre has rather a small
stage, upon which, however, as the Management is ambitious, the
most startling effects are attempted. Consequently, the Eastenders
are never surprised when they learn that the Lessee has made up his
mind to treat them to a realistic representation of an earthquake, or
a railway collision on a platform not very much larger than an ample
mantelpiece. The Lessee has a capital company, andhe and they speak
? But. perhaps, the Band is the favourite amusement of the
Eastenders. It consists of about eight performers, who wear a uniform
lesque?
which, seemingly, belonged to a Light Cavalry .Regiment that may
have been disbanded for insubordination. The tunics, forage-caps,
and over-alls are intensely and aggressively military. Thus, rather
a comical effect is produced when the fiercely-martial musicians (who
are warriors every inch of them—except their boots) perform on a
few mild violins, a harp, and a flute—instruments better suited to the
after-part of a penny steamer rather than to the parade-ground of
the tented fieM. The bandsmen keep up their military character,
however, by a sort of an "independant firing" at the tune, which
they only occasionally hit. The flute is evidently deaf, as he pays
no sort of attention to the proceedings of his colleagues, and, pre-
sumably, dumb, as he sometimes omits a note from lack of breath.
None of the others take the slightest notice of the energetic baton of
the well-intentioned Conductor with the exception of the harp. The
performer on this instrument seems to be in the power of his leader,
who, possibly, attracts his attention by constantly whispering in his
ear, By Jove, Sir, I know your guilty secret, and will hang you if
you don t follow my beats! Seemingly, the band receives some of
its income from the sale of programmes, and this bein£ the case the
trade in these publications is rendered " brisk " by a kind of game of
'' melodious questions and answers." The number of a tune is given on
a placard, and then you guess what it possibly can be, receiving only
the confusing assistance of the musicians in making the solution.
When you are tired of puzzling over the problem, you refer to the
programme, and there find under the number quoted the answer to
the musical, or rather unmusical riddle. This exercise must be noted
as one of the principal "distractions" (as foreigners would say) of
this little far-from-watering place.
Deepseaville.—Not for a moment to be associated with Eastend-on-
Mud. of which, however, if the truth must be told, it is in reality a
rapidly increasing suburb. It has a "Parade" and an "Estate
Office'' and an "Enclosure." This latter is a well-kept garden, to
which the residents are admitted on purchasing a "household
ticket" at a shilling a week. The "outside Public" (by which are
meant Cockneys in general, and Eastenders in particular) can only
gain an entrance by producing sixpence a person. This charge is
made (so a real live park-keeper in a livery, including a red waiscoat
and a gold hat-band, tells you) to keep the place select. There is
also an Imperial Hotel," with an excellent table d'hote (with a menu
in local French) and a cellar of decent wine at reasonable prices.
There are also afternoon toilettes, and Mashers from adjacent
military stations, and Anglo-Indian invalides, deserters from Bath
and Cheltenham, and a ball is given now and again, of which the
chief item is a salade of white muslin and red uniforms, in fact,
"the town on the cliff" claims a place with Folkestone and South-
sea, and is apt to sneer at Scarborough. Thus, while the humble
excursionist to Eastend drops her aspirates, the haughty denizen of
DeepseavUle turns up her nose!
Conclusion.—Debit the subject of these notes with a wretched
railway, a great deal of mud, and far too many Bank-Holiday
makers. Put on the credit-side splendid air, pretty scenery, a con-
stantly-changing panorama of ships outward and homeward bound,
and a perfectly harmless population. Balance the two, and the
result will be that, take it all round (a very long way round both by-
land and river), Eastend-on-Mud is not half bad. Only cynics will
lay a stress upon the half!

BETWEEN DIEPPE AND NEWHAVEN.
Old Lady (to Jones, who always makes a point of being civil to rich-looking Old
Ladies, who appear to be alone in th-e world}. "How KIXD AND ATTENTIVE YOU 'VE
BEEN TO ME ALL THE WAY. YOU REMIND ME OF THE YOUNGEST OF MY FIFTEEN
DEAR NEPHEWS!"
HOW THE KING OF SPAIN WAS INTEEVIEWED.
(A Story of "tlie Times.")
THE Ambassador was certainly very busy, but I firmly took hold of his
button, and followed him about all day. It was inconvenient, but necessary.
Thus I had an opportunity of approaching the subject dearest to my heart in the
pauses of business.
"The King would very much like to see you," said his Excellency, "but he is
so engaged."
I explained to the Ambassador that His Majesty need be under no apprehen-
sion that the time employed in giving me an interview would be lost. But my
friend would not be convinced; strangely enough, he seemed to become very
weary. He said he would see me no more, but leave me to his successor—that he
intended to resign. Then, flinging himself upon a sofa, he began to snore. I
sat beside him on a stool, for I would not let go my hold for a moment. The
Ambassador is the pink of courtesy, but he is also a Diplomatist.
"The King," muttered his Excellency at length, speaking in his sleep, "the
King will be at the Railway Station at nine o'clock."
This was enough for me! I let go the button, and rushed out of the room.
I saw my way to the long-desired interview with His Majesty.
And now I must tell you an anecdote. A few relatives have come to stay a
week with me. Amongst the number were my wife's father, my sister's brother-
in-law, and a second cousin of my aunt by marriage. These worthy people—tired
and hungry from long journeys, averaging a thousand miles or so a-piece—arrived
in due course. They put their heads out of their cab-windows to greet me.
"Go back!" I shouted, "don't get out—you must all go home again!"
They seemed surprised—even disappointed—but obeyed. In a few minutes
the cabs, loaded with undisturbed luggage, were returning to the Stations. Thus
I sacrificed my relatives and mvself. It is true they had invited themselves, but
what of that? I should have been charmed to have entertained them had I not
been busy. I had also asked a few friends to dinner. I had arranged a simple
menu. I hastened to the restaurant where my guests were already assembled.
I ordered a more costly banquet than that already commanded.
"My dear ones," I said. "You must dine without me. This worthy man,"
and I laid my hand affectionately on the shoulder of a rich but rather stingy
Anglo-Indian, "this worthy man will represent me. He shall be your host,
andyou his guests."
Having also explained this idea thoroughly to the head-waiter, so as to guide
him when the time arrived for making out the bill, I
took my departure. Mv quondam guests bore my absence
with the most admirable fortitude.
I reached the Railway Station. The King was sur-
rounded by courtiers. I pushed my way amongst them.
His Majesty saw me coming, and retired rather suddenly
into his carriage. I hastened to the entrance and placed
my hand upon the door.
As I looked at his Majesty. I could not help noticing
that he had certainly changed since I had seen him last,
some twenty years before. That this should be so tilled
me with the utmost astonishment, but so it was.
"Sire," said I, falling upon my knees, and kissing the
steps of the railway carriage, "I hope you will have a
fine journey."
"Thanks!" replied his Majesty, hastily putting up the
window, which I had thoughtlessly left unguarded to
perform my simple act of homage, and thus cutting me
off from further communication with him. In another
twenty minutes the train had started on its journey.
But there was a world of meaning in his Majesty's
exclamation of "Thanks!" A world of meaning. As
I shall demonstrate—hereafter!
"THE FAIRY TALES OF SCIENCE."
(Inscribed to the "Red Lions " of the British Association.)
STRANGE are all the tales of olden ages,
All the wondrous lays of fairy lore,
Shrined in legends on the well-thumbed pages,
Dear to childhood's heart for evermore.
Though the elves have left the leaves and roses,
Fled perchance to unknown lands afar,
Still more strange each tale the Century knows is—
Records of the land and sea and star.
Puck could girdle earth in forty minutes—
So said SHAKSPEARE'S elf with boastful mind;
Electricity can start and win its
"Wondrous race, and leave the fay behind.
Send a maiden telephonic greeting,
Where the Mississippi's waves are curl'd,
You shall hear how true her heart is beating,
Under all the seas of half the world.
Yonder child with Fever's hand is stricken,
Science comes to ease the labouring breath,
Shows how germs are born and how they quicken,
Air and water may be charged with death.
See the microscope new scenes preparing,
In the Wonderland its bright lens gives,
And the physiologist declaring
That great paradox, "Life dies, death lives."
How mankind, in ages pre-historic,
Lived on lake, in cave, or by the sea,
Science tells, and how, with meteoric
Speed, his flinty arrowheads would flee.
Mastodons would walk the woods primeval,
Pterodactyls mighty wings would raise,
When the ichthyosaurus lived coeval
With the Mammoth monsters of old days.
See the pale astronomer unsleeping,
GALILEO'S spirit in his soul,
Watches, as some comet's train comes sweeping,
Where the immemorial planets roll.
Star on star shines on beyond all naming,
Haply Principalities and Pow'rs;
All the mighty Universe proclaiming—
There are certes other worlds than ours.
List, then, to the Fairy Tales of Science,
Solemn and stupendous and sublime;
Nature's voice speaks out in proud defiance
To the puny sceptics of our time.
Age to age speaks on, each generation—
Finds new wonders coming at its call,
While wise men, be sure, of every nation,
Recognise the First great Cause of all!
"IT was a very fair dinner at Sir GORGY BUSTER'S!,"
said Mrs. RAMSBOTHAM; "though I think a little more
attention might have been bestowed on the entresols, and
if the lights had had what the French call their ' Shade-
overs' it would have been better for the eyes.''

THE GENTLE CITIZEN TO
THE BURGLAR.
(A Suburban Pastoral of the Season.)
OH! come to me, my cracksman bold,
And sack my silver, bag my gold!
Thy season now hath well set in,
When thou mavst loot with a safe skin.
Behold the paths are all made plain
For thy pursuit of pleasant gain.
So come, 0 happy Burglar, come
To my retired suburban home!
/ probably shall not be there,
But some old female "taking care,"
Yet let not that thy visit stay,
The wine, the plate are not away.
On hospitable thoughts intent,
I did not send them ere I went,
Myself in holiday ease to anchor,
With churlish forethought to my banker.
Perish the thought! The ancient dame
Is deaf and fond of gin. Thy game
Is all before thee where to choose,
Scarce needing use of soft list-shoes.
Come then to my suburban villa!
Its walls to thy predacious skill, a
Small obstacle indeed will prove.
The decorations cracksmen love,
The gable porch, verandah low,
Trellis and trailer, sweetly show
The way to upper windows clear;
Then th'ere are handy ladders near,
Thick shrubberies in which to lurk
Whilst contemplating thy sweet work;
Soft turfy plots to hush thy tread;
The dog is fat and overfed.
As for the Bobby, whv, his beat
Is three miles long, and shouldst thou meet
That devious wanderer on thy wav,
Smash him! To thee 'tis mere child's play.
He's armed with nothing but a stick,
Thy pistol's prompt, thy aim is quick.
Kindlv Authority will not
Arm A 13 with blade or shot.
Should he disturb thee at thy task,
Thou hast knife, bludgeon, pistol, mask.
So careful is the Law to give
Odds on thy side—that thou mayst live
A life of long and easy crime,
And score off Bobby l1 all the time."
He comes! Thou hold'st revolver! Pull it!
Poor Peeler's potted by a bullet;
Or if, with Bobby's usual pluck,
And something more than common luck,
He close with thee, and thou must fly;
Leave him crushed, riddled, there—to die!
So come, 0 happy Burglar, come
To my retired suburban home!
Come. Toby Crackit, come. Sill Sikes !—
Whichever nomen thee belikes—
Come, lift my windows, scale my doorway,
Whilst I 'm away in France or Norway,
Come! If thou dost not, with impunity,
''Tit not for want of opportunity .'
DOMESTIC METEOROLOGY.
By a Fireside Philosopher.
"Relative" Humidity.—Tendency to tear
fulness on the part of Haterfamilias and thi
girls, on Paterfamilias saying that he " can'
afford a holiday this year."
Dew-Point.—The point attained—lach
rymally —when Paterfamilias, after an
hour's argument, requests, imperatively
that he may " have no more nonsense!"
Tension of Vapour.—Phenomenon mani
fested on the first signs of relenting on th
part of Papa.
Drying Power.—Immediate influence o
the appearance of the cheque-book.

ART IN THE MIDLANDS.
Visitor (at the Shoddyville Art Gallery). "WHO PAINTED THIS PORTRAIT, DO YOU
Curator. "I BELIEVE BY SOME LONDON FIRM, SIK!!"
KNOW!"
MORE BOOTHEKATION.—Even the Correspondent of the ^mes at Geneva, usually so
remarkably favourable to the doings of the eccentric Miss BoOTH-the Fair Booth-admitted
last week that she was clearly in the wrong, and the Neufchatel Authorities distinctly in the
right. Perhaps this will be gradually understood by Authorities in this land of a hundred
religions and only one sauce-though the Boothists can supply the last-named article pretty
freely. When, within the last fortnight, the "General" sublet the Eagle Tavern to a publican,
and presumably a sinner, not a Salvationist, the former requested that the case might be
heard in private. When a "General" actuallv wants to be degraded to the.rank of a
"Private " the next in command might humour him. Everyone to his own opinion, with a
perfect right to express it quietly or keep it to himself. But noise, rowdyism, aggressiveness,
in the public exhibition of what is intended to be a religious service, becomes a Oreneral
Nuisance, which can't be disposed of, we regret to say, in private.
CHANGE OF TITLE.—He is not to be called "Grand Old Man "any more; but, if you
ai us what his new name is to be, it is "A First-rate Feller."

ANOTHER LITTLE HOLIDAY CRUISE.
Starting—Homeric—Hebrides—Opinions—Morning—Scrubbing —
Lurching—Erin—Salutations— Costume— Tubbing — Fine—
Tapley Juniot—Nautical—Breakfast— Weather — Reporting
Progress—Maps—Hints—Books—Studies—Shooting.
WE are starting. I am made aware of this about five o'clock A.M.
The overture commences with a quick movement on deck within a
few inches of my nose.
Happy Quotation (Shakspeariaii).—" Sleep, gentle sleep, Nature's
soft nurse, how have they frightened thee, that I no more can lay my
eyelids down and steep my senses in forgetfulness." They do scrub
and rub. This is what I suppose they call "clearing the decks for
action "—the action being our presently starting to cruise about the
Hebrides. "The Hebrides" sounds like Greek.and seem somehow
to be associated with HOMES. HOMEH and the Hebrides strikes me
as a familiar title. It will have more the ring of a long voyage to
say, when I return to London—saying it. of coarse, quite carelessly,
as an everyday occurrence—" Oh, I^e been to the Hebrides," than
merely to tell my friends, "I've been yachting about the coast of
Scotland." There are some people, I am sure, who will simply regard
me with mixed feelings of awe and astonishment,and after replying,
"No! really! have you! how nice!" they will go among their
friends, and, so to speak, make capital out of their having met "So-
and-so, who has just returned from the Hebrides."
Were I simply to say, " I 've been yachting off the coast of Scot-
land," the sort of people alluded to above would be inclined to laugh
or sneer at such a way of yachting; in fact, they would doubt my
statement altogether, and be prepared to swear that I had never been
"off the coast of Scotland" at all, but had contented myself with
remaining on it, and imagining the rest. And others, the bold
buccaneers who never get further than the edge of the Serpentine,
would observe, satirically, that they didn't think much of yachting
always in sight of land. "Thavs not," they'd say, "what they
call going to sea."
So, for the sake of friends and acquaintances at a distance, I am
glad that our Commander is taking us among the Hebrides.
Oh. that scrubbing and rubbing! Does anyone ever get accus-
tomed to it_F I doubt it.
What noises there are always on board a yacht when she is getting
"under weigh." The anchor chains to begin with, or the two
anchors' chains, as the case may be. There's a row!
Sometimes I fancy there is a revolution on board, when I hear the
sailors shouting, unanimously, "Down with her!" and repeating it
all together several times, fiercely.
So, when they cry, cheerily, "Haul him in!" it sounds from
below, either as if they were saving life at sea, or had caught an
enormous fish. Then suddenly everything goes with a whack all to
one side, and if the dressing things haven t been properly secured
overnight, "bang goes saxpence " in no time.
This morning there is nothing of this sort. We seem to be a long
time in getting under weigh.
The Merry Young Steward enters the cabin, and says there is not
much of a breeze, but that we are out of Larne Harbour, and that
She (the Creusa) is going on as well or even better than could have
been expected.
In quitting Larne we leave Ireland. "Farewell to Erin!"—
after having been once on shore for about fifty minutes. I can add
this to my list when I return. "Where have you been?" "Been?
Oh."—always carelessly—" cruising about Ireland, Scotland, The
Hebrides, and so forth "—but always, for effect, keep the Hebrides
to the last.
In the very early morning (everybody appears to get up earlier than
everybody else, and the difficulty is to get up first) we come upon
one_ another wanderingabout in strange fancy costumes. The salu-
tation generally is "Hallo! you up f Good morning!" Then we
recount to each other how we slept, now we are, and how we hope to
be. After this we inquire of each other, "Are you going on deck?"
when the answer is uncertain, as if each wanted for a while, at least.
to get rid of his companion (a difficult thing on board a yacht), and
then we all meet again unexpectedly on deck, when we are once
more equally surprised, and seemingly not best pleased. Then we
go down again in detachments of one at a time.
KIIXICK is remarkable. He is dressed, as he has been dressed all
night, in fantastically-coloured pyjamas, in which ho looks like a
Chinaman "with a song"—that », as if ready at any moment to
hold up the index finger of each hand, break out into "ching a ring
a ring ching," and do a dance,—which, I believe, is the popular view
of a Chinaman—at all events, it is mine, judging from their repre-
sentatives on the stage.
KILLICK is at once christened the "Great Pyjama himself with
the little round button at the top"—which, as being personal, he
resents, and returns to his berth as if he had made a mistake in the
day, and had determined to go to bed again, till things had taken
a more favourable turn, and the world generally was ready to receive
him. Subsequently, having finished my toilette, I open my door, and
come suddenly and quite unexpectedly on KniiCK, or rather nearly
over KILLICK, who appears to be rising out of the floor of the

neously, "Why, what the" when I see what it is. He is taking
a bath, and the baths on board the Creusa are not in the cabins, but
in the passage; I apologise,—which has no softening effect on him, as
I hear him grumbling till he begins sluicing, sighing and groaning
like a man under torture,—and then I step over him, and go up the
companion and on deck.
*»•***
It is lovely, and we are sailing gently along, with wind and tide I
should say. Everybody is happy. The Captain salutes, and takes a
very cheery prospect of the weather. The Man-at-the-Wheel is
smiling;; the men in foke'sel are lounging and chatting. They have
finished their morning's work, and so straight is to be our course
that no tacking, no " going about" will be required.
The Merry Young Steward comes up the companion to infonn me
of the congenial readiness of breakfast. This information he gives
in his own peculiar way. The Merry Young Steward, or MARE
TAPLEY Junior, as I have already christened him, is, when on board,
nothing if not nautical: but being nautical, he is everything.
Although only gifted by Nature with a pair of hands, he is always
ready to lend one of them whenever and wherever it is required. The
more work he has to do the better he does every bit of it,_the happier
he appears, and the more time he seems to have on his hands for
fishing, pulling and hauling at the ropes, mending clothes, cleaning
the rifle, attending to the lines, arranging the flowers (he has a good
eye for colour), polishing up everything, and coming out in several
different costumes, Valet, Cook's Assistant, Butler, Sailor, Waiter,
Steward, in the course of the day. As the late Mr. ROBSON used to
say when, in the Farce of Catching a Mermaid, he sang "The
Country Pair," "Oh, he's a w-o-o-o-nderful b-o-o-oy!"
He announces each meal with a cheery "Breakfast is under weigh,
Sir," or "Dinner or Lunch "—as the case may be—" is under weigh,
Sir!" This morning, at breakfast, he comes, with a beaming coun-
tenance, to inform his master that " he must take in a reef in the
butter, as, from some accident or other, our supply of this article is
limited.
We don't grumble, we don't look serious, we don't complain, but
such is the effect of MAKK TAPLEY Junior's cheeriness, we all become
suddenly quite mirthful and ready to scream with laughter at the
prospect of short commons in this direction, If he had announced
to us, on returning from some foraging expedition with an empty
basket, that the island where he had been was a desert, that there
was no land within three days' sail even with the most favourable
breeze, and that our provisions were reduced to a backgammon board
and a cruet-stand, and that starvation (he would put this in his
brightest and happiest manner) was imminent, we should all cheer
up, and even feel that we had had rather a satisfactory meal than
otherwise. So we assist with a will "in taking in a reef in the
butter," and make up for the deficiency with, as TAPLET Junior
suggests, "double rations of marmalade."
It all meals on board a yacht, while in motion, could be like this,
then yachting would be perfect. It is the very poetry of motion;
but oh, when the prose comes, or when the poetry becomes a little
uneven, and then gradually eccentric!
The breakfast passes off pleasantly, all having been put into excel-
lent spirits by the Merry Young Steward, and CRAYLEY doesn't
contradict KILLICK more than half a dozen times on as many_ subjects,
and we saunter on to the deck to enjoy the morning, which we_all
agree is heavenly. Our host smiles benignly and with becoming
modesty, as if deprecating anything like a compliment on our part
being addressed to himself in grateful acknowledgment of the mag-
nificent state of the weather. Some hosts invariably take to them-
selves their guests' hearty commendation o_f the weather, and reply
to any remark on the beauty of the day, in an off-hand wajr, with
"Yes, isn't it?" their tone be,ing that ot men with special privileges
who can afford to pity such ordinary people as are compelled to put
up with any sort of weather they can get. Yet even MELLEYILT.E.
seated reposefully, admits that " it is certainly very pleasant," and
evidently wishes us to understand that this is nothing to what can be
done in the way of fine weather when we 're out yachting with Aim.
Where are we? Larne has vanished. But there are coasts left
and right. The Commodore will explain. TAPLEY Junior brings on
deck a chart, in which all the sea is marked like land in an ordinary
map, so that, after sailing about with my index finger from point to
point for ten minutes, I give it up in despair, and prefer being
instructed by "One Who Knows." KILLICK and CRAYLEY are at
loggerheads already as to where we are. The former is positive that
Ireland is on our left and Scotland on oar right, while the latter is
certain that the situation is exactly the reverse.
We are perpetually referring to maps, and asking each other.
"Where are we P" *' Which is Ireland ? *' "Which is Scotland Pji

"Where's the Isle of"—whatever it maybe, and so forth. This
leads to discussion and contradiction. Now, what a waste of time
and trial of temper would be avoided if alone the shore, wherever
practicable, notice-boards were stuck up, with Ireland," or " Scot-
land," or " England," as the case may be. How useful to ships from
everywhere! All the Islands should have boards up with their
names on them. Railway Stations have the names up, streets have:
why not bays and creeks, and gulfs and the entrances into seas?
"Why not at the corner of an island have a board up, with " This
way to the Atlantic "? and so on.
However, we take our information from MELLEVILLE, who, with
out the aid of the chart, knows all about it,—is acquainted with the
names of the islands, the swifts, the shoals, the rocks, and so forth,
but prefers to point them out on the chart, for the sake of practice
and for satisfactory corroboration, in order to prevent dispute.
KILIJCK and CRAYLEY discover that they were both right, as each
declares he had meant exactly what the chart shows is really the
geography of the place.
It is wonderful what a collection of books has been brought on
board by everyone. The library is considerable and varied. To
account for this we explain to one another that, as old hands at this
sort of thing, we know how difficult it is to amuse oneself during a
calm, and in general what a first-rate opportunity for getting through
novels, or, in fact, any sort of literature yachting affords.
Every morning after breakfast, therefore, we appear on deck, each
with his book. Our host has one of DAUDET'S novels, CRAYLEY one
of BOISGOBEY'S, KILLICK has laid in a stock of cheap novels, bound
in illustrated covers, evidently intended to attract the Public in the
same way that a work of Art outside a booth at a fair, or a theatrical
picture-poster on a wall is intended to attract, and with about as
much truth. KILLICK doesn't profess to know the names of the
books, or of the Authors; he has gone entirely by the pictures, and
has picked them out of a "job lot, marked " reduced to a shilling."
One of these—a different one every morning—is always in his hand.
His method of reading, when he does read at all, for he has a rifle by
his side and a pouch of ammunition, and is perpetually on the look
out for all sorts of sea-fowl, guillemots, divers, gulls, whales, and
porpoises, all being game that comes in sight—his method of reading
is to examine all his books—reviewing the outsides—in order to see
which picture is the most sensational (he forgets them from day to
day during the first part of our trip), and then, having made his selec-
tion, he appears on deck in a soft, shapeless, neutral-tinted hat, a
retired Ulster of a curiously variegated pattern, showing three inches
of flannel "trouserings," as the tailors call them professionally, a
pair of deck-shoes, carrying the novel in one hand, the rifle in the
other, and a pouch of cartridges slung over his shoulder.
The next cart of his performance, for he can't settle down to read-
ing at once, is to look all round to see where we are—this we all do
whenever we come on deck, no matter when it is, during the day,
and no matter whether we are sailing, becalmed, or in harbour, there
being always a sort of instinct, even in the two last-named cases,
that we mav have drifted, or got away somehow; and, indeed, I
notice that the Salts themselves, the very oldest and most experienced
among them, invariably come on deck as if they 'd just awoke from
a long sleep, and look about with the puzzled air of men -whose eyes
are not yet accustomed to the light, and whose first words will be, if
they speak, "Where are we now, eh?"—and KILLICK being no
exception to the rule, though, of course, each man has his charac-
teristic way of looking about him, and KII.LICK'S is one of annoy-
ance, as he scans the scenery frowningly. with tightly-closed lips,
and his hand clutching the rifle, as if ready to deal out destruction
even to the landscape itself, and put a hole into it, as if it were a
panorama painted on canvas, if it isn't exactly to his taste.
Having expressed in a single grunt his general dissatisfaction with
everything, and, so to speak, turned up his nose at Nature for pre-
senting herself under such an aspect to him on that morning when
he had clearly expected her to have something quite different ready
for him,—as, if it is nothing but sea, he wants land; if in sight of land,
he wants it to be all sea; if we 're among islands, he complains 01
the monotony of the view, and so forth,—he deposits his rifle and
cartridge-pouch on the seat by his side, and then opens his novel.
As he lias by this time forgotten what the picture was, he has to
refresh his memory and sharpen his appetite for perusal by a refer-
ence to the cover, and then the fourth part of the process is to turn
over the pages, one at a time at first, then three or four rapidly, then
in handfuls, until his attentjon may be arrested by some description
that tallies with the sensational situation depicted on the outside.
If he succeeds in finding this within the first ten minutes, he will
either settle down to that page, or he takes its number,—treating
it like a cabman with whom ne had had a dispute—and, his attention
perhaps being distracted by the harsh quack of a sea-fowl, or being
impelled by a sudden-impulse to kill something, or, at all events,
to try to, he jumps up, seizes his rifle, loads it, and peers about to see
on what object he can wreak his intentionally terrible, but practically
impotent, vengeance. When I say "practically impotent," this is
only true when he aims very carefully at anything; but if he takes
a hap-hazard pot-shot, there is no knowing what, or whom, within
alhundred yards, he may not kill.
Fortunately, in sailing among the northern islands we are never so
close to shore as to render his shooting at a duck positively dangerous
to one of the occasional islanders; or, if we are ever sufficiently near
for KILLICK'S shooting to be dangerous, the islands are generally to
all appearance uninhabited, or, should there be a cottage or two
scattered about at unsociable distances from one another, as if their
position was due to some volcanically social disturbance that had
dispersed them in this manner, there is no sign of a living soul
anywhere about, even to watch the few cows that may be grazing

SIR,—I hold a good official position, am in receipt of a handsome
income, am well connected, and I have three boys who have all
received the education of Gentlemen. Coming to the conclusion how-
ever that, at the ripe age of fifteen, there is no immediate opening to be
found for them in their own sphere of life,—at least, without involving
me in expenditure that I do not feel justified in incurring—I have
apprenticed one to a journeyman plumber, while of the other two I
have, without any hesitation, made respectively an omnibus con-
ductor and a provincial dustman. Beyond a little back-stair influ-
ence, the whole business has cost me actually nothing, and the lads
acknowledge that they have a start in life that not one father in a
hundred would have given them. That they may prosper, and
eventually take care of and support him in his old age, is the well-
calculated design and earnest wish of yours obediently,
AN OXFORD D.C.L.
Sra,—I haven't been home for the holidays more than three days
(we 're to have nine weeks, not including the three extra ones we got for
the marriage of the head-master's mother-in-law), and I don't know
now a bit what to do with myself. I "ve cleaned all the clocks with
soft soap, re-silvered a couple of Queen Anne's looking-glasses, kept
Guinea-pigs in the harmonium, swept the next door chimneys from
the top with a rake and a hearth-rug, and made a vampire trap in
the butler's pantry—and a lot more. Yet I don't know what to be
up to next. P'raps I might have had some fun if my seven elder
brothers hadn't all been sent to reformatories. So please put in this
letter, and let it say a word for me. For though mother complains
she's a bit " tired at times, she says, after all, I am
THE FLOWER OF THE FLOCK.
SIR,—Will you tell me what I am to do? I have a couple of boys,
who are enjoying the advantages of a superior education, with
wholesome though excellent food, at a noted Academy in Wapping.
But the holidays are intolerable. They give the pupils one week at
Christmas, and no less than three at Midsummer. I consider this,
Sir, simple swindling on the part of the Authorities, especially as my
two sons, when at home, so irritate me by their mere presence that I
im continually pursuing them from room to room with a broomstick.
They are at the present moment cowering under the bed in the spare
room, much to my exasperation: and where they get their abomi-
nable ill-temper from is, and always has been, an unsolved puzzle
to your long-suffering Correspondent, A NICE MOTHER.
SIR,—Tour Correspondent, the "Mother of Nine Burglars," is
quite right—home influence is a mistake. Acting on this principle,
I give no holidays at all, and advertise only for incorrigible boys.
My efforts in this direction have been most successful, and so fast
have pupils poured in, in answer to my call, that I am proud to say
my establishment is already the terror of the neighbourhood. We
are 170 in all, and have given the local Police force so much employ-
ment during our last summer term that I hear it is shortly to be
increased. Onr list of "distinguished" scholars is no mean one;
three have been hung, five are doing their fourteen years, while no
less than twenty-eight are working out minor but fairly stiff sen-
tences. We have also turned out several cabmen, two crossing-
sweepers, and we stand very well at the Inebriates' Home. Can I
say more? It will, of course, be understood that I keep a good
staff of warders, and that, though I give no vacation, I find it wise
and salutary to take one. But whenever I am absent for more than
ive months at a time, I need scarcely add that myjilace is invariably
Hied by a competent and painstaking UNDER-MASTER.
SIR,—I 've got a great deal to gay on this highly interesting sub-
ject, but, unlike your Correspondents, I 'm not fool enough to waste
ny valuable and edifying remarks on the Dull Season.
Yours, &c., GREEN GOOSEBERRY.

THE perils and. the pothers of the Session past,
The Pembroke Castle Northward ho! was bound at kst,
And WILLIAM to the winds all his longshore troubles cast;
And chief among his messmates was ALF TEN-NY-SON.
For ALFRED had a tenor voice, and songs could sing galore,
And he twangled "like an angel" on a harp he always bore,
And along with the crew he had come away from shore,
As Minstrel for the voyage—ALFRED TEN-NY-SON!
Singing toddi-oddi-iddi-iddi-um-tum-tay! &c.
For WILLIAM he had met with him, and cried, "I say,
Mayhap you 'd not object that harp to twangle and to play,
Like the old Sirens, out at sea?" The Minstrel answered, "Nay,
I shouldn't,—not a morsel," says ALF TEN-NY-SON.
Says AVLLLIAM to him, "I have joined this here ship,
And my shore-going comrades I nave given all the slip,
So maynap you will partake our cruise and join us for the trip."
"You 're a right good sort of fellow," says ALF TEN-NY-SON.
Singing toddi-oddi, &c.
So upon the Pembroke Cattle's poop they both sat down,
A-talking of great statesmen and of bards of high renown:
And they drank as much—say nectar—as might come to half-a-crown.
"This is really very jolly!" says ALF TEN-NY-SON.
As WILLIAM was about another long yarn to out-pay,
A Sawbones party came abaft—in nautical array.
".Why, ihiver me!" says WILLIAM, "if here isn't that Sir A ."
"Who 'd ha' thought of seeing you here?" says ALF TEX-NY-SON.
Singing toddi-oddi, &c.
The Sawbones he seemed staggered. "Eh!" says he, "the talk
ealled'tall'?
And grog? and pipes? Oh! WILLIAM, such high jinks won't do at
all:"
"Oh, never mind!" says ALFRED; "don't you go and raise a squall.
Confound it, don't you know me t—l 'm ALF TEN-NY-SON!"
Says WILLIAM, "Pray remember the advice you gave to me.
'Tis now three years ago or more since first I tried the sea,
I find these frolics set me UP, and so I 'm sure will he.'"
"Upon my word, he hits it," says ALF TEN-NY-SON.
Singing toddi-oddi, &c.
Says the Sawbones, says he, "Well, it may be as you state,
But you do not mean to say you 've got this Idyl] chap as mate?
You know you promised me to keep jaw-tackle taut. "Just wait,
And you'll find we 're on the ' Skvelark,'" says ALF TEN-NY-SON.
So he plumped down on a barrel, and the laurels round his head
Took a Bacchanalian rake, and on his harp he twan-gle-ed,
Whilst WILLIAM danced a hornpipe, with a light elastic tread.
"There, that doesn't look like doldrums," says ALF TEN-NY-SON.
Singing toddi-oddi, &c.
Then the Sawbones hitched his trousers and he—measured out a glass—
Which wasn't homoeopathic—and he cried, "Well, let it pass!"
Then he lit his pipe and listened. "Why, a man must be an ass
To play the owl for ever!" says ALF TEN-NY-SON.
"To fret and stew about things much is all in vain.
We are off to Skye and Orkney, and ' to Norroway o'er the main'
As to WILLIAM, when to Westminster he does come back again"
Then they were off ere one could say " ALF TEN-NY-SON!"
Singing toddi-oddi-iddi-iddi-um-tum-tay! &c.
POOR Mr. FARINI! The Whale is dead! So like a Whale too!
"0 Whaley Whaley 0!" Mr. FARIXI may cry in this whale of

over the proceedings.

In chaffing evil? Tell me, what's the fun
Of ever climbing up the climbing wave?

In roughish weather! I, for one,
Ask for the shore—or death, dark death,—I am so done!

That a sorrow's crown of sorrows is remembering days on shore.
Drug his soda, lest he learn it when the Foreland gleams a spec
In the dead unhappy night, when he can't sit up on deck!
SUNDAY.
Ah! you Ve called me nice and early, nice and early, CURRLE dear!
What? Really in? Well, come, the news I 'm precious glad to hear;
For though in such good company I willingly would stay—
I 'm glad to be back in the bay, C'UHRIE, I 'm glad to be back in the bay!
ALPHONSO ABROAD.
THE King of Spain is to send two telegrams a day to- Queen
CHRISTINA, whose jealous propensities have been publicly illustrated
of late. Here are a few intercepted:—

more than a thousand people or so to meet me, and none of the

isn't more than two-and-thirty. FERNAN NUNEZ quite changed.
Staid, sober, respectable. Suggests the Arts Decoratifs, and M.
MA SPEED on Egyptology as amusements.
PAHIS. Midnight.—Only time for word. Arts RtcreatiJ'sand Dum

present. Bed directly after supper—bread and cheese and olla
prodrida in memory ofthee.
MUNICH. Noon.—Austerest capital in Europe, except Madrid as I
have reformed it. Art shows splendid, but am gratified to remark
that classic figures carefully curtained "for the King of Spain."
Delicate attention that of LUDWIO'S; of course he's invisible, but
shall leave a card.
MUNICH. Midnight.—Suggestions in last as to LOLA MONIES most
unjust. Never thought of her ail day, although, as you remark, the
name is Spanish. Spent entire day practising German and trying on
German uniforms. Find them rather heavy for my figure—tongue
and togs. Confess that have been half-an-hour in a bisrgarten—
but no Ladies—and MOZAUT with violoncello.
BERLIN. Noon.—Only time for a word. Military duties impera-
tive. Princess Imperial charming, but never thought of flirting
with her. Englishwoman—don't Hirt. Besides, all time given up
to Mars. Venus nowhere.
BERLIN. Midnight.—Yes. did kiss the third high-born Lady-in-

The wealthy Pork-factor took another turn 'across the gorgeous
reception hall that served as the drawing-room of his splendid and
palatial mansion. As he advanced, the rich pile of the costly
Damascus rugs that were heaped indiscriminately about the marble
floor literally impeded his progress. With a sudden jiause he fell
upon a gold tapestried fauteuil and brought his clenched fist angrily
down upon a priceless inlaid ivory Indian writing-table. The blow
shattered it to atoms. At the same time several 175 carat diamonds
flew with a jerk out of the crowd of keeper rings the millionnaire wore,
all over the apartment.
But a plush-legged and powdered fifteen-stone menial shovelled
them up with indifference, and tossed them into the street below.
Such scenes were common all along the best side of Fifty-ninth
Avenue, and the mistress of the house merely gave a pretty laugh.
She had got to the figure of three hundred and ninety dollars in
emeralds on her front, and looked spry.
"Guess you 're riled 'r1" she said.
"Guess I am." the Pork-factor replied, with a six-horse oath.
Then he added, between his teeth, "I m going to make it white hot
for HIRAM."
At this moment a Dude entered. He was cleanly fixed, and would
have passed for a Gentleman in the deluge. But there was a slight
pause as he appeared. Then the Pork-factor rose, and threw an
ormolu inkstand or so through a Boticelli. The new-comer noticed
the irritation, and merely smoled.
"It's no use, my respected bosses," he said; "you may do what
you darned please; but I am not going for pork."
There was a scene in that gorgeous drawing-room that could be
heard distinctly at Chicago. A jewelled chickeringj was broken into
candle spills, and both the chimneys were set on fare by a blaze of
five thousand dollar notes.
»»»»»»
As the Dude entered the Momus ten minutes later there was a
sympathetic cry of "Wai?"
"He has cut me off with a million," he replied, quietly draining
an iced Elephant Rouser as he spoke. "I 'm a ruined cuss!"
"You air!—you air!" was the prompt reply; and the entire con-
signment went for a new Club then and there. Things move smart
in the States. They had left him to rot on that figure in the gutter!
AN OXFORD EDUCATION.—At the Oxford Hall of Music, Sir, I
mean, which might be affiliated to the Roval College of Music, of
which we have not heard so very much lately, Jock and Jenny are a
wonderful pair, and their duet is something like a genuine Monster

Jock-ular uud Jenny-ings performance.
Concert. By the way, it's a wonderful audience at the Oxford,
quite a study in itself, for its very respectable bourgeois character.
Husbands, wives, and small families are there—I saw one baby with
a bottle enjoying itself amazingly—all equally pleased, and not par-
ticularly demonstrative. The comio singing of a Mr. HARRY
HUNTER, and his eccentric dancing, were the best things in the
entertainment, which otherwise, always excepting Jock and Jenny,
who are delightful, was not quite up to the Oxford Hall-mark. I '11
try another, and report myself. YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.

A CHIP FROM THE PREMIER'S LOG.
Off West Coast of Scotland.—Three bells. At least, think\it's
three bells, but not quite positive. Glorious weather. Glorious
health. Pleasant to have companionship (not another vessel) of
TENNYSON, also Sir ANDREW CLARKE, Lord DALHODSIE, and family.
Pity that ANDEEW CLARKE will forbid me to talk of politics; also
has asked TENNYSON not to excite me by reciting too much poetry to
me—no harm in a little of the Promise of May just before bed-
time, but nothing else. Useful to have a Medical Adviser on board
who can keep off Liberal Addresses.
Just had a splendid lark with Poet Laureate, behind funnel, where
ANDREW CLARKE couldn't see us. Game of "capping verses."
TENNYSON awfully good at it. I tell him he oughtn't to be allowed
to use his own verses. Says he doesn't know any other poetry, and
doesn't want to, "and he 'd like to see old BROWNING equal it, that's
all." I refer, incidentally, to my poem in Nineteenth Century.
Fancy TENNYSON is a little jealous about it. Pretends not to have
read it. Says he leaves hymns to Dr. WATTS, and doesn't see why
English people should choose to go and write in Italian. He never
did it, and doesn't know why I should. Change subject hastily, and
Ei politics. Curious that TENNYSON doesn't care to talk about
t or the Bankruptcy Bill. Says that "politics bore him."
y he ought not to be so one-sided. Wonder if politics bored
HOMER or SHAKSPKARE?
Off Strome Ferry.—Deputation of savage-looking fishermen row
out, a^id wish to see me. Ask DALHOUSIE it it's necessary; he says
he thinks if I don't that I shall lose no end of Scotch seats at next
election. Hope deputation hasn't heard about Sunday sitting of
House of Commons. I go down and talk to them through the lee-
scuppers, as I fancy they are called, soothingly. Invite them to
service on board (it being Sunday), and read them the passage about
the " Widow's Cruise,"'as most appropriate. Find afterwards that
old TKNNYSON is horribly offended, because he wanted one of his own
things used as a hymn! Strome Ferrymen ask for distinct pledge
that anchor won't be raised till Monday morning. Captain says he's
"taken the pledge" long ago, and ANDREW CLARKE assures fishermen
that any further conversation will give me an attack of apoplexy.
Why not call Strome Ferry a " corrupt constituency," and disfran-
chise it P
Somewhere near Stornatcay.—Yeel gloriously well. Got up early,
and knocked at TENNYSON'S cabin to wake him. Thought I would
please him by shouting through key-hole a quotation from May
Queen, about "You must wake and call me early." TENNYSON
shouted back that he wanted a "few more winks," (not a poetical

and says he" knows I'm getting much stronger, because my jokes
are so horribly bad. Certainly do feel well, and send off several
telegrams to Emperor of China, Mr. SHAW, CETEIVAYO, and CHAM-

Jordan in Jeopardy.
AT Constantinople, the other day, Admiral INOLEJTELD
received an intimation that the SULTAN would grant him
an audience," in order that he might explain the details of
the Jordan Valley Canal _ Scheme." Will those details
include a satisfactory provision for raising the wind to the
requisite amount, and, out of that, the allotment of a
sufficiency of backsheesh to the Sovereign of Turkey?
Because then there will apparently be nothing to prevent
the Jordan Valley Canal from becoming an accomplished
fact, and to protect a particularly distinguished part of
the Holy Land from being overwhelmed with an inland
sea. Swamped by a Joint-Stock Commercial Company,
will not the Valley of Jordan verily and indeed have
fallen into the hands of the Philistines?
this occasion. Laureate kindly gives a recitation of Morte
d'Arthur this afternoon to most of crew in engine-room. Stokers
all delighted. Sir ANDREW pleasantly remarks that he was
"mouthing out his hollow oes and aes." After the recitation I offer
to repeat the Odyssey in original Greek, with running translation of
my own, or the most thrilling bits of Juventus Mttndi, with Italian
hymn to finish. Stokers won't hear of it—say they 're sure I want
rest. So does ANDREW CLARKE. But I must do something, so I offer
TENNYSON (who's sitting on a coil of rope, chewing a "quid") five
minutes' start if he '11 write five hundred lines of blank verse against
me in an hour, and see who can do it best. TENNYSON doesn't take
to idea. Wants to know who's to be the umpire. I suggest DAL-
HousrB. TENNYSON would prefer Man-at-the-Wheel. But I don't
think Man-at-the-Wheel quite impartial, because TENNYSON has
been reciting whole of Idylls of the King to him in private, and he
says he likes 'em. Find TENNYSON gives men tobacco while he
recites to them. I '11 try them with my Italian hymn, and give them
the Idylls of the King, and is now beginning to give Man-at-Wheel
benefit of chief parts of In Memoriam. Captain says he infinitely
prefers a mutiny to'a Poet on board. He can put a mutineer in irons,
but " he's blessed if he knows what to do with a Poet Lory." I say
that the only thing I can suggest is a new Crimes Act, to apply to
vessels at sea, and ask ANDREW CLARKE (who can do everything) to
go and settle quarrel. ANDREW CLARKE offers to look at TENNYSON'S
tongue, but I don't see much good in that. Finally, the Laureate is
drawn off by being assured that there will be murder done in the
engine-room if he doesn't come and explain to stokers what he meant
by " a roaring moon of daffodils."
In Kirktcall Harbour.—Yerv J?^a(l to get back here, safe and
sound. Can't escape deputation of aggrieved Crofters. CLARKE tells
them my health mu*t give way if I talk politics to them. They
reply that their health has given way long ago, owing to poverty and
anxiety, and won't I give them a Scotch Land Bill next Session?
Make short speech to them (Sir ANDREW holding my pulse to see I 'm
not over-exerting myself), and say I '11 think about it. They ask me
to chip off a little of paddle-box with my axe, as they would like a
memento of their visit to me. Why shouldn't TENNYSON do a lyric
on the wrongs of the Crofters? Suggest the subject to hi™ for a
drama. He seems a little gloomy about the drama, and says, "IRVING
might take it, but he fancies his Cup is full."
On a fine September dav the Orkneys certainly look lovely. "A
place for Lotos-eaters," TENNYSON calls it. We are having quite
a nice conversation on HOMER, and TENNYSON is saying that the
land is one "wherein it seemeth always afternoon," when ANDREW
CLARKE bluntlv says he "wishes it were, because then it would be
always a few hours before dinner." and begs me to choose some
healthy maritime subject to talk about. Tells me I ought to "do
the complete yachtsman," and " forget that I 've such a thing as a

CHILDE CHAPPIE'S PILGRIMAGE.
CANTO THE SEVENTH.
I STOOD in London, on the bridge which lies
Tall tower and (swelling dome on either hand.
From out the stream Saint
Stephen's spires arise,
St. Paul's huge summit
dominates the land;
Between them runs the
noisy, wheel- worn Strand,
Hushed now awhile, for
early morning smiles
O'er the swift river, and
the grey, yet grand
Wide-winged old city of
Titanic piles,
Huge capital of our little,
lordliest of all isles.
She looks a sprawling Mam-
moth from the river
Risen, withunspannedbulk
and ungaugeu. powers.
O'er league on league the silver morn-mists quiver
Upon her mijjhty maze of roofs and towers.
And what brings she, what are her dearest dowers
To wealth-spoilt golden youth? The Comus feast,
The Rahab lap piled high with gems and flowers,
The Circe draught proffered by Pleasure's priest,
Which lures the eager lip, and leaves the man—a beast.
in.
But where is he, the Pilgrim of my song,
Who 'midst this city lived the life called " fast"?
Doth he upon his pillow tarry long 'f
He comes no more—those flutterings were his last;
The butterfly is stricken, netted, cast,
Wing-bruised, bloom-robbed aside, a thing that was;
To-day a phantasy, not to be classed
With " form" maintainers—these must let him pass,
Tanish in Limbo's gloom, sink in Despair's morass.
IV.
Scattered his substance, linked life, honour, all
With—what? A thing that silence fain must shroud.
"Gone to the bad, poor beggar! What a fate!"
"Under the very dingiest kind of cloud."
"Thought he was 'cuter, or at least more proud."
"Yes—regular church and ring affair, a craze
Most melancholy,—can't be squared, too loud!"
So cackle they, in vague slang-garnished phrase,
The "other Johnnies,"—ohums of his exuberant days.
What profits prying into the abyss
Where plunge the witless dupes of flaunting shame,
Of vulgar Melusines who writhe and hiss,
Too late detected? CHAPPIE 's lost to fame.
Who '11 wipe the dirt from the dishonoured name
Society no more hears 'f For never more
Shall lie who's siren-mated be the same,
Unless high genius Lush the social roar—
Genius whose spell to miss were "quite too great a bore."
VI.
But I must end. My Pilgrim's shrine is won,
And he and I must part—so let it be.
His task in life was the pursuit of " Fun ;"
In Babylon there are thousands such as he;
Each year breaks hundreds, and the wrecks few see.
That venturous Muse were voted all too bold
Who golden youth in their gregarious glee
Should paint, or the veracious tale unfold
Of dull esurient lives in gilded styes outrolled.
VII.
Upon the young yet Wasf Childe the years,
Hot though not very many, now have done
Their battering work. Not suffering, nay, nor tears
Have aged him, but that same pursuit of Fun.
The boy his pk-asure-huuling racu hath run,
And he hatb^his reward, and it is here— > ,
That he nff more may bask in Fashion's sun,
Or call the lithe-limbed ballet-dancer dearly
Or flauntitaWJeSy hat, and tie starched styFaiuTelear.
Tin. J^**^
"The had "—dull desert!—is his dwelling-place,
With one worn harpy for his minister.
Forgotten by his fellows in the race,
Hating the world, hating himself and her.'
"Fun s " Nemesis! And what ennobling stir
Lives in such paltry passions? Are they not ,",
Sordid as savage orgies? Were the whirr
Of Ixion's wheel more weary f Is the squat
Smart counter-jumper's round a more ignoble lot?
IX.
There still is pleasure in fair Clieveden's woods,
There still is frolic upon Thanet's shore,
Flirting at Prince's, where no " cad " intrudes,
Song in the Strand, and music in its roar:
But CHAPPIE knows them all no more, no more;
From these familiar raptures he must steal,
From all that he has seen or been before.
To wander in far Noman's-land, and feel
That name, abode, life, dress, are matters to conceal.
x.
Roll on, thou shallow stream of Pleasure!—roll!-.-
Ten thousand skiffs float over thee in vain,
Prows prone to rapids, helms beyond control;
Awhile they dance upon thy watery plain,
Then fleet to wreck, and nothing doth remain
Save a sad memory of the bitter groan
When one more struggler, slackening the fierce strain,
Sinks wave-choked, weed-encumbered, stark, alone,
Gone to the dogs, unstayed, unfriended, and unknown.
XI.
Childe's ways are not upon thee now,—he yields
Himself thy spoil, thy Sirens do arise
And mock him from their midst; no strength he wields,
And weakness, born of thee, thy nymphs despise,
Spurning it from their bosoms. Who there lies
Must lie in linen soft and rich array.
Mirth, not late maudlin tears, in ardent eyes.
Let golden youth once fail of golden pay,
He's cast, like Israel's calf, to earth. There let him lay
xn.
With his fool tears the dust wherein he falls!
Circe cares not for those who pule and quake.
Her prey, the fry of flaunting capitals,
Are needless flutterers who are bold to slake
Their clay in her fleree draughts; their strength she '11 take,
Then call the Philistines to blind and mar.
They are her toys to play with, flaunt—and break;
For Pleasure's victims ever captives are,
Drawn by Armida, chained to Cytherea's car.
XIII.
My task is done, my song must cease, my theme
Is as an echo's echo. It is fit
Swift to dissolve this dream within a dream;
The mime must be dismissed who here hath lit
Burlesque's quaint lamp of borrowed ray. I 've writ
An apish whimsy, yet of things which now
Small bards may see and sing. The visions flit
Most palpably before me, in the glow
Of London s flaring lamps, now burning dim and low.
XIV.
Farewell! A little word which some I ween
Will welcome; some perchance may—but, farewell!
Te who have traced my Pilgrim through each scene
Of his life-farce, if in your memories dwell
Thoughts of the follies of the callow Swell,
The vain and verdant " Johnny," not in vain
An o'ertrue tale have I essayed to sing.
Farewell! With him, poor moth, must rest the pain,
With you—if such may be—the moral of my strain.
THE Chinese Prime Minister is, it appears, named " Li." If he
were our Premier, wouldn't Mr. LVBOTCITEXE, M.P. for Truth-in-
the-Well, go for him!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A BLOODLESS BATTUE.
IN THE NAME OF HUMANITY LOUD BARNDORE WRINGS THE NECKS OF ALL HIS PHEASANTS, AND HAVING STOCKED HIS PRESERVES
WITH DUPLICATE SPECIMENS FROM THE BRITISH MUSEUM, INVITES HIS FRIENDS FOR A DAY'S SHOOTING.
OUE PARCELS.
(Further Correspondence.}
SIR,—I have also, like your Correspondent, "A CONFIDING
LUNATIC." some reason to complain of the working of the new Parcels
Post. Here is my own experience. I have, from time to time, been
in the habit of despatching from this place eighteen-pennyworth of
jam-tartlets to a clerical friend in the Seilly Isles. This pastry
I have invariably packed with great care in a cardboard case, left
open at the ends to keep it fresh, and, for greater security, have
myself delivered it at our village Office, where a highly intelligent
youth takes sole charge of the Parcels Department. Though I have
in the course of the last five weeks despatched no less than twenty-
three of my little cases, I have heard from mv chagrined and morti-
fied friend that everyone of them has reached, him perfectly empty!
Need I say that this has astonished me?
I am, Sir, your obedient Servant, A PUZZLED VICTIM.
SIR,—The most fragile articles can, as far as my experience goes,
be conveyed by Parcels Post, not only with thorough safety, but with
the greatest facility. BACCHUS has only to encase his new-laid egg in
cotton wool, envelope it in paper shavings, then add two pounds of
sifted Arabian sawdust, finally sealing-up the whole, labelled
"Dynamite, with care," in a hammered steel oblong chest—(he can
pick up one of these anvwhere second-hand for about fi ve-and-thirty
shillings)—and he can despatch it as soon as he likes to his invalid
friend in Warwickshire with absolute confidence. Only the other
day I sent a dozen specimens of the common Stable Moth (Itahdellariits
teutonicut), each done up separately in this fashion, as a surprise to
an entomological uncle at Slough, and though, after having the cases
opened in the hall by a couple of local blacksmiths, who brought
their blast furnace, bellows, and a forge hammer or two with them
for the purpose, he was a little annoyed to find, that, owing to the
sawdust having got loose, the whole dozen had arrived without their
heads, antennte, and wings. Still he appreciated fully the novelty
of the Parcels Post, and I have not heard from him since.
Yours, &c., A CAUTIOUS PACKEH.
SIB.—I have been fishing in Scotland for several months, and on
Tuesday fortnight last, under favourable conditions, succeeded in
landing my first take—a magnificent seven-pound salmon. Having
Sromised a hamper or two during my season's sport, I at once
espatched my fish by Parcels Post to one of my London friends, a
noted epicure, but by some mischance he declined to receive it, and
it was returned to me addressed to Stirling. Following me about for
a week, I at last came once more into possession of it at York. The
Hotel Proprietor, however, declining to let it stay for even a few
hows, with my luggage in the hall, I again sent it off, this time to a
country friend in Cornwall. Imagine, therefore, my astonishment,
when arriving at mv residence atCamberwell yesterday, I found that
owing to the refusal of the Postal Authorities at Exeter to transmit
it any further, it had been returned to me by night-luggage service,
accompanied from the Station by the Local Sanitary Inspector, who
has threatened me with .proceedings on the part of the Parish
Authorities. I have now, apparently, no course open to me but to
have it kippered. Comment is superfluous.
I am, Sir, your obedient Servant, PiscATOE.
SIR,—I do not consider the prompt delivery of game by Parcels
Post an unmixed good. I received this morning a brace or grouse,
both fine three-year-old birds, that were shot at post-time yesterday
evening in the North, and despatched to me forthwith. Having
some aged relatives staying with me, I had the game cooked for break-
fast at once, but with most disappointing results. So terribly tough
was the flesh, from mere freshness, that an uncle of mine instantly
broke a set of false teeth to pieces in an effort to get through it; while
my wife's grandfather, a hitherto hale old gourmet, whom we had
persuaded to try a mouthful off the breast, had ultimately to be
taken out of the room, choking and in a fit. Thist and one of the
legs, has upset my wife; while I, who somewhat foolishly finished the
rest of the birds, am, as I pen this, suffering acutely from cerebral
indigestion. Your dissatisfied Correspondents, therefore, may take
warning from one who wishes the Parcels Post at the bottom of the
Red Sea, and has determined next time he gets a consignment of
game to be in No HURRY.
SIR.—I had the other day to despatch to a friend in the country
a small tea service of Dresden china, a valuable satin fan belonging
to MARIE ANTOINETTE, and a rare and exquisitely finished ivory
miniature of my great-grandfather. These costly articles I packed
up neatlv, but roughly, in a few deal shavings, and took the oppor-
tunity of sending along with them a bottle of anchovy sauce, a flask
of Lucca oil, a hearth-stone or two, and a coal-hammer. Though the
whole were loosely done up in a bit of newspaper, with all possible
care, they arrived in a condition that showed the grossest carelessness
in the carriage. The fan was saturated and limp as a sponge, the
tea service in fragments, while owing to the escape of the oil and
anchovy sauce, _ nothing was left of my great-grandfather, but his
right eye and his shoe-buckles. I have written to the Postmaster
General, but I am told I have no case. Such, Sir, is the treatment
meted out under this new system to one who always hitherto has
signed himself, A CIECUMSPECT ECONOMIST.
Sra,—I don't think that it 's them Correspondents of yours who
keep sending their rubbishing things through the Office that has a
right to grumble. Look at me. Here only yesterday I did my
twenty-two mile with three brace of black cock, a haunch of venison,
fourteen pound of tea, half-a-dozen bottles of cough mixture and
other stuff (some of 'em leaking), a coffee-kettle, two barrels of
oysters, enough stuff for dresses to clothe half the county, no end of
butter, ladies' boots, clotted cream, and a wasps' nest as had got
loose among the lot,—and all this without an extra blessed half-
penny. So, please, Sir, I think it's time you might have a line about
these here Parcels from THE COTOTBY Posra&jr.

MR, GLADSTONE'S LITTLE LUNCH.
PART I.—OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.
Kates from the Pocket-Book of a Hussion Editor.—
"Mr. GLADSTONE entertained the King and Queen of DEN-
M A KK and the Sovereigns of GREECE and RUSSIA on board
the Pembroke Castle off Copenhagen. He drank to all
present. Sir DONALD CURRTE also returned thanks.
After the luncheon, Mr. TENNYSON read extracts from
his works." Copied from a London paper. Capital sub-
ject for an article in "the Monster Caviare Season."
English PREMIER proposing the Big Father's health. Look
up some of the articles on the Duke of EDINBURGH'S
Wedding. Peroration to finish with, "A friendly un-
derstanding between England and Russia would by no
means be a superfluous guarantee of peace in the pre-
sent time of alarm." Mem.—Wonder how the Big
Father liked TENNYSON'S reading aloud? The recita-
tion, if it had been given at St. Petersburg, would have
led to Siberia!
Notes from the Pocket-Book of a German Editor.—
The not-for-a-moment-to-be-expected visit of Herr
GLADSTONE to Copenhagen may be fraught with alto-
gether-ambijruous-and-precariously-unsatisfactory sug-
gestions. The history-making event is one calling for
rrom-the-inner - consciousness - born - aspirations - like re-
flection of a never-to-be-too-cautious-nor-too-patriotic-
feeling journalist. Here is material for one thousand
columns of ever-to-be-venerated-and-remembered copy.
But must pause until instructions are received from His
Highness the Prince VON BISMARCK. Mem.—Most para-
dox-producing incident was undoubtedly the probably-
slumber-inductive recitation of the Poet-Laureate!
Notes from the Pocket-Book of a French Editor.—
Sir GLADSTONE for laughter! An, the enemies of the
beautiful France! But it is a subject! Sir GLADSTONE
and France? No. France without Sir GLADSTONE. France
means Glory, Economy, everything! France always
France! Sir GLADSTONE! Bah'! France always France!
Mem.—France was avenged by the recitation of Esquire
TENSON! But he is drole that Esquire TENSON!
Notes from the Pocket-Book of an English Editor.—
Better subject than Wasp-bites! Homely tone, of
course. Means nothing but little family party. Reduce
the fractions, GLADSTONE and his Royal and Imperial
guests, to the Common Denominator of BROWN, JONES,
and ROBINSON. Mem.—Idea for a biographical Magazine
Article, "TENNTSON regarded as a Practical Joker.
PART H.—IMPRESSIONS OF TUB GUESTS AND HOSTS.
Extract from the Diary of a Northern King.—Rather
embarrassing, but everything went off very pleasantly.
Delighted that the English PREMIER avoided politics. But
ALEXANDRA (dear girl) said he would—" that he was
always so nice." Mr. GLADSTONE'S speech seemed quite
short, too. Thought, until I looked at my watch, it had
only taken a couple of hours! His remarks about HOMER,
the Hebrides, and the History of the Penny Postage
System most instructive. Sincerely trust that Mr. TENNT-
SON did not notice that I was asleep,—at least I mean
that I had closed my eyes while he was reading.
Extract from the Diary of a Southern King.—Not half
bad fun. Bet ALEXANDER that if I could only get him on
his legs he would give us a three-hours' lecture. Won
my bet, with lots of time to spare. Scarcely fair, though,
as I remembered his form when I met him in England.
However, for all that, a very fine speech. Liked, that
long bit about tree-felling. Had no idea he knew so
much about European, African, and American forests.
His account, too, of Sir WALTER RALEIGH'S and Captain
COOK'S voyages most interesting. By the way, trust Mr.
TENNYSON thought I was only thinking when I covered
my head with a silk pocket-handkerchief after ten minutes
of his recitation.
Extract from the Diary of a Czar.—Mr. GLADSTONE'S
speech excellent. Wish I had understood English a little
better. DAQMAR tells me that his account of the Courts
in the Crystal Palace was most interesting. The lecture,
too, he incidentally introduced on the rise of Punch from
its commencement to the date of last-week's Cartoon must
have also been most amusing. It appears he was the Author
of the celebrated mot, " Advice to people about to marry,"
but he didn't want the fact "to go beyond that table."
Received an annuitv of £100 a-year for it! Well, not
dear at the price! Trust sincerely that Mr. TENNYSON

did not notice my fatigue while he was reading. I have no doubt that the
recitation was much liked by those who did hear it!
Extract from the Diary of a K.C.M.Q—Most gratifying! Thanked their
Majesties and their Royal and Imperial Highnesses " for the honour conferred
on me by their presence on board. GLADSTONE in good form, but it did not
appear to me that he made enough out of the menu. He had lots of chances
too; because he gave incidentally a capital lecture upon French, Spanish, and
Chinese cookery. However, his description of ship-building in all its branches
was excellent. The Bard would read again. Don't know how the Royalties
took it, because I was fast I mean, because I was not very closely
attending!
Extract from the Diary of a Grand Old Statesman.—Really delightful
day. My few remarks, too, seemed to give satisfaction. Glau I had an
opportunity of saying my say about the cosmopolitan supplv of coal, and the
probable future of what, for the want of a better term, I called "Aerial Navi-
gation." My sketch, too, of the art-treasures of Munich seemed to be appre-
ciated. Then the account of my researches in horse-rearing- in Colorado
apparently interested my audience. I repeat, a really delightful day. If I had
had a few hours more, I could have touched upon a number of other subjects;
but ALFRED was so impatient to begin! By the way, I am rejoiced to feel that
he is so carried away when he is reciting that he never hears my snore
I should say, breathing!
Extract from the Diary of a Grand Old Poet.—It was fortunate I brought
with me a complete edition of my works. I am sure, from the rapt silence
in which they listened to my poems (not a single interruption from beginning
to end), that they would have been cruelly disappointed had I not recited
them all! =====

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ANOTHER LITTLE HOLIDAY CRUISE.
More Sport—Study—Books—Interruption—The Rifle—How to ttse it
— On Gulls—And Shooting—Humanitarianism—At Rest.
THE shooting having commenoed, he "reads no more that day,"
neither does any one of us, as self-preservation being a first law of
nature, and love of sport or of destruction being a latent instinct in
every Englishman's constitution, we all want first to take the rifle
from KLLLICK, and secondly to have a shot with it ourselves. As
each takes his turn, the crew act as beaters, pointers and setters^ so
to speak, marking the game for us (this can t be a correct sporting
expression, as it so evidently belongs to the billiard-room), and
directing our attention to coming coveys, or to sea-fowl floating on
the'waters, which would otherwise have escaped our less experienced
and generally somewhat defective vision, for MELLEVILLE wears a
pince-nez, CRAYLEY is useless without his eye-glass, KLLLICK is
generally in a state of biliousness which affects the clearness of his
vision, and I am compelled to wear tinted glasses, which soften the
glare, but give a wintry aspect to every view.
So, putting down our books for the day, as far as serious reading
goes, though each of us still carries his own volume about with him,
and would be verv angry were it mislaid, or if anybody else took it
up, we form ourselves into a shooting party, or a rifle-gallery party,
and proclaim ourselves the foes of the wild fowl, the porpoise, and of
the Sea Serpent itself should he dare to appear.
For my own reading I have brought a philosophical work, in two
volumes, on " Inductive Analogy" (a most interesting subject, which
I had intended to begin in the train), and the three first volumes of
RICHARDSON'S Clarissa Harlowe, because of the new sensation that
Pamela gave me some time ago when the first of these revivals was
brought out, and because Messrs. SOTHERAN & Co.'s new edition is
in the clearest possible type, and is a good, steady, well-bound,
comfortable and easily-held book,—but after a quarter-of-an-hour's
deliberation as to which I shall read, I take the philosophical treatise
and open Chapter One, beginning "Inductive Analogy is to the
metaphysician what——" but at this point I am called oil by CRAYLEY
to look at the scenery; or, after I have again settled down,;by our
host, to inquire what we would like to do to-day in case of reaching
shore sooner than we had expected; or, when I have made myself
quite comfortable, that is as comfortable as is possible out of doors,
whether on shore or at sea. for reading purposes, I am startled by
the popping of the rifle and an exclamation from KILLICK in a tone
of savage disappointment, followed by a bitter sotto voce murmur of,
"Ah! I was precious near him that time!"—when I feel mastered
by so strong a sporting impulse, that I fling philosophy to the winds,
and very nearly into the sea, and partly from a Desire of honest
emulation which has made so many heroes-and which induces me to
hope that I shall prove successful where KLLLICK has failed, I ask
him to let me have a shot with the rifle. KLLLICK is the old hand,
and stands by me as a sort of sardonic Caspar, watching the efforts
of his pupil Rudolph, in Der Freischiitz. "Six shall achieve, the
seventh deceive," was ZamiePs arrangement, if I rightly remember.
But I haven't got the charmed bullet as yet, and the six don't achieve
anything except giving me a headache, and the seventh doesn't
deceive me by hitting anything; though, at this point, MELLEVILLE,
who detests a rifle on board because of the noise, but_ character-
istically keeps one for the amusement of his guests, joins in the sport
—and, finally, so does CRAYLEY, who can't see three yards before
him without his eye-glass, and can't hold the gun and the glass up
to his eye at the same time. The love of sport is fatal to all attempts
at morning reading.
In the afternoon, if not sailing in pitch-and-toss water, we recom-
mence our studious attempts after luncheon, when we are more
inclined to smoke, look lazily at the view, and indulge in desultory
conversation. This time I bring Clarissa Harlowe on deck, and am
commencing a desultory study of the Preface and the descriptive
oast of characters given as in a play, which is very exceptional in a
novel, but not a bad idea as a saving of trouble—when it occurs to me
that reading is very bad for digestion.
CRAYLEY is of all of us the one who makes greatest progress
with his novel by BOISGOBEY, because it is an exciting plot, and full
of stirring situations and mystery. KILLICK, not being inclined to
read or shoot, settles on CRAYLEY'S book, and asks him how he
likes it? To which CRAYLEY, without looking up from his book,
and treating KLLLICK as the good St. Anthony did the temptress,
replies, "that he likes it very much," and continues reading.
"Capital book," says KILLICK; "I 've read it. Have you got to
the part where the young painter murders the girl P"
"Oh, for goodness' sake," cries CBAYLEY, imploringly, who is
evidently just coming to this very critical situation in the novel;
"Oh, for goodness' sake, don't tell me what is going to happen."
And again he wraps himself up, so to speak, in his book.
But KLLLICK, being in a nasty humour, won't let hi™ off, and
continues,
"I wouldn't spoil your interest in it on any account, as it is one of
the best plots I 've ever come across. I 'm not sure"—(CRAYLEY
once more gives a faithful representation of the good St. Anthony,
and pretends to be absojbed in the novel)—"I'm not sure whether
I 'm confusing tie plot with another—because they are all rather
alike,—but isn't there a detective—at least, I mean a man comes in
with blue spectacles and a red beard, and turns out afterwards to be
the detective whose wife has given the poisoned bracelet"
Here CRAYLEY can stand it no longer. "Look here, my dear
fellow," he says, closing the book, and screwing his glass almost
fiercely into his eye, as ne absolutely faces his tormentor,—" Look
here, if you want to tell them the storv, and spoil my enjoyment of
the book, say so, and I '11 go below"
But, before he can carry out his threat, and before KILLICK can
retort, a diversion is created by our host, in favour of a line of plaj*ful
porpoises, to which he directs KLTXICK'S attention, at the same time
handing him the rifle and cartridges, which the Merry Young
Steward, MARK TAPLEY Junior, has most opportunely brought up,
cleaned and ready for use, on deck.
Our rifle-shooting is very harmless. If a gull or a puffin looks a
bit staggered, we are all extremely sorry, and the marksman apolo-
gises, so to speak, and sincerely hopes he hasn't hit it. The gulls do
offer tempting shots. As a rule, we take fearless aim. knowing that
the effect of our shot, like an effort of genius, will be deathless.
Once, however, in a calm I shoot at a gull flying, and absolutely
wing it. "We are all sad at heart, though we are fain to acknowledge
the excellence of the shot, which astonished no one more than
myself. The other gulls utter plaintive cries, and circle about their
wounded companion. It seems to me that all the birds of the air are
"sighing and sobbin' when they heard of the death of poor Coek
Robin!*
A "hand"—nautical term for one of the crew—they are all
"hands "—[Happy Thought.—a. Pirate's crew would be afl " legs,"
"black-legs "]—-is sent out in a boat to terminate the bird's suffer-
ings. "We can hardly bear to watch the proceedings. MELLEVILLE
turns away, KILLICK looks on gloomily, CRAYLEY hides his emotion
behind his eye-glass, and, though trying to keep up a sportsmanlike
bearing, with, the nfle in my nand, I feel very sad at heart, I
remember the Ancient Mariner and the Albatross; and, as the man
returns with the dead bird—a ghastly object—in the boat, I feel I
could burst into tears. Why did he bring it back? It can't be
eaten, and there.'s no stuffer on board, or any means of preserving it.
[Happy Thought.—If you are going to shoot uneatable and curious
birds, never sail without a "Stuffer " on board. This sounds as if
the crew were going to pass some examination, and that a " Stuffer"
was identical with a lf Crammer." A propos of this, here are the
materials for a conundrum: "Why would this new functionary and
the Commodore to whom the Yacht belongs represent two celebrated
Elaces in the Hebrides P" Because one would say of himself, " I am
tuffer." and the other, "I Owner." (Necessary explanation—
"Staffa and lona.") How angry Dr. JOHNSON would have been if
BOSWELL had made this riddle. *' Sir," said Dr. JOHNSON, "you 're
an ass!"]
Alas, poor gull! I am as sad as I was when I winged a young
rabbit—whether "winged" is a correct, sportsmanlike term, I am
not sure; but I never heard of "legging" a rabbit, which is what I
did, poor thing!—and it cried like a child, so that with a nervous
but determined hand I had to give him the other barrel, and finish
him. I sat down on a bank, and made a vow never again to shoot at
a rabbit unless I was certain of killing hi™ outright, and at once. In
a moment of excitement I have ridden recklessly over plough and
fallow to harriers, and been in at the death of the hare. The others
were rejoicing, as at a great victory over some ferocious and devas-
tating wild monster, or like natives over the bodyof a man-eating
tiger; but I pitied "poor Puss "; and when the Whip came round
with the cap, I put three shillings into it, instead of the usual half-
a-crown, by way of a penance.
I have never been m at the death of a depredating 'fox, when
a farmer's delight is natural and excusable. _ In faet, I have a
natural aversion to killing anything, and must indeed be roused to
an ungovernable pitch of fury before I can kill the most persistently
irritating fly, and even when I have despatched him I regard his
lifeless remains with compassion for his idiotic obstinacy in worrying
me. which brought about his untimely fate. Six creatures I can see
killed with ferocious pleasure—a bluebottle, a wasp, a black beetle,
a rat, a horse-fly, and a hornet. If anything happened to the Yacht
before I leave it, I should set it down to my having shot the harmless
gull.
After this, we'only shoot at inanimate objects, such as bottles and
cigar-boxes.
Subsequently, as sport is a necessary part of a yachtsman's life,
we take to fishing.
And here again the same tenderheartedness prevents my being
delighted when I get a bite, which, I am glad to say, is of rare occur-
rence. I like fishing; it is a solemn and soothing occupation. Time
never flies with such rabidity as when one is sitting in a boat or on a
bank with a rod or line in one's hand.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
If you are a crack shot and invariably kill, there is no cruelty in
shooting game; but the best-hooked fish dies a lingering death. Let
us hope that they have no consciousness of pain, and .that their
wrigglings and jnmpings are mere involuntary exhibitions of
muscular power. Yet fishing is very fascinating—and most fish are,
if well dressed, good eating. All regrets have vanished when I see
them broiled for breakfast, even when the one I caught is pointed
out to me (the fact is so extraordinary that all the crew know it, and
the Merry MASK TAPLEY Junior, as he places the dish on the table,
points to" the small one in the centre, and says to me, with glee,
* That's yours, Sir,"—and I ask that it may be at once handed to
me, when I devour it with genuine relish). Time, the consoler, heals
sorrow, and in the space between coming in from shooting and the
dinner-hour, the poignancy of my grief has vanished, I have become
hungry, I am ready to compare notes of my prowess with my fellow
sportsmen (I can be as truthful on this subject as the best of 'em),
and when the hare I shot appears on table, I can cut him up and
eat him with the liveliest satisfaction.
*•••**
After a delightful sail, during which we have had occasional
glimpses of the Atlantic, have seen about twenty islands and one
inhabitant, also two or three yachts, and MEILEVILLE, who knows his
way about here, has pointed out where the Whirlpool is, which has a
great attraction for me at its proper distance—we turn round a corner,
and as the sun is setting, we glide into a bay, and after the usual noise
attendant upon " bringing ourselves to an anchor" (we don't bring
ourselves to it, as we Ming: it with us, but nautical terms want re-
arranging) we pipe all hands for dinner, which in a few moments is
announced by the Merry Young Steward as_" being under weigh."
It is a lovely moonlight night as after dinner we pace the deck in
the soothing tranquillity of Lpwlandman's Bay, only broken by
KTLLICK humming Casta Diva, in a very subdued tone, as he looks
up sadly at the moon, so wistful in his. expression that he might be
taken for the Man-in-the-Moon, ejected for arrears, sorrowfully
regarding his native land, to which he can never more return until
he has paid his rent.
MELLEVTLLE playfully inquires, " What's that noise?" On which
CBAYLEY satirically observes, that "it's curious what an effect the
moon has on some animals."
MELUEVTLLE remarks, that he has heard of "baying the moon,"
and wants to know from KILLICK if this is it?
KILLICK is ready. "Yes," he replies,'' this is Lowlandman's Bay.'
Whereupon we invoke the shade of Dr. JOHNSON in the Hebrides,
who with his Dictionary did so much to help the punster. Then we
descend. "No Cards/ Music.
CHANGE FOR A SOVEREIGN.
(Stray Leaf from a recent Hamburg Dress Diary.)
8 A.M.—Breakfast in my own ordinary Royal reception uniform,
minus the under-waistcoat and epaulettes, which] H.R.H. the Duke
forgot to return after the dinner last night.
10 A.M.—Summoned to call on the EMPEROB. Borrow the full-
dress Colonel's toggery of the West Brandenburg Hussars, of which
I was made Honorary Chief after supper on Tuesday. Busby
doesn't fit, and comes right down over my eyes to my mouth. Put a
couple of Daily Telegraphs into it, and hold my head on one side.
CAMPOS says but for that I should look " every inch a king."
Nooir.—-Receive visit of ceremony from the Monarch of ROUMANIA.
He seems to have got on a British Field-Marshal's uniform, a German
helmet, and—yes, one of my missing epaulettes. I give him the
Grand Cordon of the Golden Hveena, and cleverly take my epaulette
off as I am investing him. A pleasant interview.
2 P.M.—Off to attend the Review, in the full-dress of a Servian
Field-Marshal, lent me by the Prince. Find at the lajt moment
that he has forgotten to send the high boots. Have to go in slippers,
and feel cold, but am told afterwards by CAMPOS that I looked all
right at a distance.
4 P.M.—Have received the order of the Blue Pelican, and to don the
uniform of the Stagivogitsky Regiment for the purpose. By some
mistake get hold of that belonging to the Drum-major. Find it
hopelessly large, but by padding with a bolster or two, and taking in
here and there with hair-pins, make it do. The German EMPEBOB
seems annoyed at my appearance, but I really can't help it. Hope
he won't strike me out of the European Coalition.
6 P.M.—Dinner—but finding that during my absence every uniform
I had brought with me has been borrowed by some magnate or other
for the ball in my honour at the Spanish Embassy to-night, have to
go in my old crimson-flowered dressing-gown, and a Portuguese
cavalry shako. Am cheered in the Unter den Linden in the dark, so
I suppose it's all right.
8 P.M.—Taken by the Emperor of AUSTRO-HUNGABY for the
Chinese Minister. He proposes my health, and I have to return
thanks in Pigeon-Spanish.
10 P.M.—As soon as I get home am asked to lend my dressing-
gown to the Prince of BULGARIA, who has. he says, to appear in the
costume of the British Life Guards, and that he has got every bit of
it together but the tunic. Oblige him. Find, however, I have now
absolutely nothing left for myself.
MIDNIGHT.—To bed in my great-coat and one cavalry-boot, and
the ribbon of the Order of the Iron Footstool. To sleep, fancying I
am missing paper-hoops on a Circus horse.
TON-KING.
JOHN CHINAMAN'S SONG ON THE SITUATION.
AIR.—" My Queen."
I AM not unwilling hal f-way to meet her,
But I know her game, which I will not play.
Whether she 'd lick me, or I should beat her,
I know not quite, but I shan't give way.
La France is selfish, ah! fie upon her!
She 'd take all Annum under her wing,
And rob me of all the suzerain honour
That I get from thee, Ton-king, Ton-king.'
France has been going it awfully lately,
Kicking up bobberies left and right;
But I rather think she is erring greatly,
If she supposes I shall not fight.
I 'in not so humble as that, my Lady!
My smile is calm, but I carry a sting;
And if shindy comes, it will find me ready
To battle for thee, Ton-king, Ton-king!
If France will be courteous, I "11 be lowly,
For flowery blandness I greatly love \
But that "neutral zone" means "collaring," wholly,
And though I 'm " childlike," I 'm not a dove.
My suzerainty I am game for keeping;
France as near neighbour is not the thing,
And men shall fall, and women go weeping.
Ere I cease to hold thee, Ton-king, Ton-king!
A HARD ROW.
SIB,—My neighbour, Mr. PBEBENDABY Row, writing to the Spectator
of September 15, on the " Blasphemy Prosecutions," said:— I have
the sheet which was the subject of prosecution lying open before me."
After telling his readers the contents, he goes on, "I labour under
a disadvantage on this occasion, because I dare not pollute your pages
by such a description of them as would give your readers a lively
idea of their contents," &c., &c. "I con, therefore, only observe
that they stand far beneath the level of the most outrageous carica-
tures that have ever appeared in Punch."
Now, Mr. PREBENDARY Row should be aware, unless he may be
charitably allowed the benefit of the Irish boy's saving clause, and
be considered as in a state of "inconsavable ignorance," that no
comparison or analogy can be honestly and fairly instituted between
such coarsely executed and grossly blasphemous caricatures as he
has described, and Mr. Punch's artistically-drawn satirical Cartoons
on political and social subjects, to which the term "outrageous"
could never be applied. Mr. PREBENDARY Row, of St. Paul's, seems
to have yet to learn " who is his neighbour;" and so, Sir, I beg to
sign myself your neighbour and his namesake,
PATEBNOSTEB Row.
*.* We select this out of a heap'of indignant correspondence
which Mr. Row's letter has evoked. As for Mr. Punch, he can only
say, that not having the slightest personal acquaintance with Mr.
Row, he is astounded at the Prebendary's familiarity in speaking of
him as "Punch." A person who would be guilty of such a breach
of good manners would say anything.

THE DUKE OF BEDFORD has offered to sell Covent Garden Market
and surroundings to the Corporation. Of course the Corporation
won't buy it. But here is a chance for Sir W. VERNON HABCOTTBT to
show London what a Concentrated Municipality would do if it had
the chance. The Duke is tired of it. Now is the time to clear Mud
Salad Market and make it pleasant to the eyes and noses of our long-
suffering fellow-citizens. Where is the Hercules for the task?
Couldn't Sir WIIXIAM V. HERCULES come to the rescue now, and
show himself quite an At-Home Secretary? Send for the First
Commissioner of Works and the astute B. MITFOBD, Esq., C.B. The
men who lowered the Wellington Statue are capable of raising the
wind for the clean-sweeping of Covent Garden. The youngest
son of an American millionnaire might buy it, and become in our
estimation a second Peabody, a Sweet-Peabody.

AT THE GATES!
(With acknowledgments to the Poet Laureate.)
Tux "Warder of the growing hour,"
Though hard for lesser men to mark •
Whilst round him all the horizon 's dark
With engineries of hostile Power.
So, laurelled Singer, silver-strong
Athwart thy strain will fancy Hit,
And voices of the moment fit
With shifting echoes of thy song.
The Warder, this, of thy large dream,
This Titan of the iron soul,
With stern glance fast upon his goal,
Cold, keen as his own armour's gleam?
Warder indeed, firm-based and bold,
Not moved by show of threatening steel,
Or subtleties of soft appeal;
Grim-jawed and of colossal mould.
Few roseate chivalries illume
The frank unfaltering Teuton's course;
Few Lancelot graces. Iron force
Of brawn and brain, from spur to plume.
But steadfast, still, whate'cr befall,
As that Pompeiun Sentinel.
What he shall ward is warded well,
Or temple gate, or city wall.
The gates he guards are as the gates
Of that old temple, Janus-named,
Closed now. Bv whomsoever claimed,
That post he calmly holds—and waits.

(To accompany tlie Presentation of the latest Arm for the Force; a JPhistk.)
1. SHOULD you notice a Housebreaker entering a mansion at mid-
night by a cut-out window, you will ask him politely what business
brings him to the place in so unconventional a manner and at so
inconvenient an hour.
2. Should the Housebreaker refuse to answer you, or reply rudely,
with an oath, that " you had better mind your own concerns, and
leave him alone," yon will produce a text-book upon the Criminal
Law, and explain to him in what manner he may be guilty of a
felony.
3. Should he treat your lecture with contempt, you will assure
him that you are a Constable, and produce your credentials for his
examination.
4. Should the Housebreaker be still unreasonable, you will call
upon him to distinguish the difference existing between the status of
oae of the Public and that of an Officer of the Law.
5. Should the Housebreaker still turn a deaf ear to your admoni-
tions, you will warn him that if he enters the mansion with felonious
intent, it will be your duty, in discharge of your official position, to
arrest him.
6. Should the Housebreaker after this enter the mansion, seize all
the plate, slaughter the larger part of the family, and fire with a
revolver half a dozen shots at yourself, you will instantlv produce
the substitute yon have recently received for your rattle, and—
whistle for the thief!

HOLIDAY ECHOES.
DRAMATIS PEBSON.E—Several hale-looking, bronzed, weather-beaten
Holiday-makers. One Pale-faced Stay-in-Town.
Pale-faced Stay-in-Town. Hullo, JONES! Back so soon? Thought
you were off for months. And where have you been, and what have
you been doing?
Jones. Oh, I have been up in Yorkshire, shooting1.
P. S. How capital! Splendid county, Yorkshire; grand open
scenery; vast expanse of moorland; bracing air, that puts your
nerves right for ever; good plain food. Why, you must be as sound
as a bell!
Jones. Oh, yes, I daresay. Of course people talk like that, and I
have no doubt to a certain extent they are right; but, you see, I
wasn't living in a very quiet house.
P. S. But in that magnificent air and scenery you didn't want
quiet and an indoor life.
Jones. No; and we didn't want brandies-and-sodas in the morning—
or, rather, I think we did; but it was a moot point—at any rate, we
had them. And then there was'." Boy" -always at Ittnehy-aad a- peg
or two before dinner, and an admirable cellar: and what with the
grogs in the smoking-room, we never got to bed before two or three.
P. S. Then I fear I was a little bit premature when I congratulated
you on your perfect state of health.
Jones. "Well, yes—no—hardly. I feel a little upset, you know-
rather shaky, and all that; but I have not the remotest _doubt but
that when I have settled down, and had two or three weeks in London,
I shall be every bit as well as when I started. 'Morning!
P. S. 'Morning! Here's BROWN back in London again! How
brown—no pun !—you are looking! How are you?
Brown. Among the middlings, thanks—only among the middlings.
P. S. But you have had a holiday?
Brown. Oh, yes. I have been yachting off the Devon coast.
P. S. Lucky man! Good boat, fine weather, jolly company.
What could be more delightful?
Brown. I suppose it sounds rather pleasant. Yes, we had a
rattling boat and fair weather, and a very good lot of men on board.
P. S. You must have inhaled enough ozone to last you your life-
time. I think to be on a yacht with a good topsail breeze, when the
water goes bowling past you and the weather copper is high out of
water, and the sea is eddying in the lee-scuppers, and as you bound
along over the waves you feel that every moment the breeze is
driving all the musty old cobwebs out of your brain, is one of the
most invigorating, health-producing sensations the world has. All
cares seem to fall from you. You fear no knock at the door, dread
no ring at the bell. Your- duns have ceased from troubling, and your
callers are at rest. You get no telegrams, and despise newspapers.
Brown. Of course, of course, from the land-point view of yachting;
but our host was a very bad sailor, and, consequently, we spent a
good deal of time in harbour.
P. S. That doesn't matter so much in Devonshire, as, wherever
you land, you have a lovely walk in every direction.
Brown. We didn't land much.
P. S. Then what did you do?
Brown. We generally used to 50 below in the cabin and play Loo,
and you know its usual accompaniments.
P. S. But you weren't always in harbour. Hang it, you must
have gone out to sea sometimes.
Brown. Only in calms.
P. S. Even then you got the pure, unadulterated sea air f
Brown. In a way: for, you see, we generally, in a calm, used to
go down below in the cabin and play Loo, and it was hot, thirsty
weather.
P. S. Your trip, then, won't have done you so much good as I had
hoped.
Brown. Oh, I am not very bad; and—hullo, it is a quarter to
twelve! I must be off. I have got to see my Doctor at the hour.
My liver is very wrong, but I have no doubt he will put me right
soon, and then I shall be as well as ever I was. Glad to have seen
you. Good bye!
P. S, Good-bye! What, ROBINSON? How goes it? All well at
home, I hope.
Robinson. No, no: I am sorry to say we have dreadful trouble at
home. All the children are down, my wife is nearly dead from
fatigue and grief, and I myself have been up nursing them the last
two nights.
P. 8. Goodness gracious! What is it t
Robinson. The Doctors hardly say definitely, but it is some form of
typhoid.
P. S. Nasty, beastly thing. However, if they will only pull
through quick, you can get them all down to the seaside.
Robinson. That's where we have just come from.
P. S. What place?
Robinson. (The reader may fill this in according to his own
libellous taste.)
P. S. But surely that is a town where the death-rate is next to
nothing, and which is always held up to admiration by nine out of
every ten medical men?
Robinson. It is. That 's why we went there.
P. S. Was there an epidemic raging?
Robinson. No; or if there was, we got it all to ourselves.
P. S. Then how do you account for it P
Robinson. You see we are different to the natives. Drainage has
no power to affect them or their death-rate. It has on us. After
lodging six days over an open sewer, all the youngsters were taken bad.
P. S. How very sad! But what do the Doctors say? I trust they
are hopeful.
Robinson. I am happy to say they hold out tolerably flattering
expectations. They consider that now we have got the children back
to our own well-ventilated and well-drained house, they, having
naturally strong constitutions, will not be long in coming round.
Bye! bye 1
P. S. Bye ! bye! old man. What, you, GREEN! Heard you were
on the Continent.
Green. How are you? I got back last night.
- ------- ............ — ~ ..... ~
Green. Oh, not very far—Antwerp, Brussels, Cologne, up the
Rhine. Baden, Strasbourg, and home by Paris.
P. S. Not a bad little round. Did you enjoy yourself?
Green. Thoroughly.
P. S. I am glad to hear that. By Jove, it is a comfort to find one
man has had a good holiday. What are you going to do to-night?
One can't offer much to a man fresh from the Continent; but even in
London one can give a fair approach to a French dinner, and the
Gaiety is open again.
Green. Ugh! Thanks awfully, old Chappie. But I am going
down into the Weald of Sussex this afternoon.
P. S. What on earth for?
Green. Well, you see. what with travelling, and table-d' hates and
cafe life, and seeing Galleries, I am a little bit off colour. So I am
just going down to do a good week's walking in the country. Get up
early, go to bed early, do five-and-twenty mfles a day, live on nothing
but chops and bread-and-cheese, drink a little beer, and only one
glass of whiskey at night, and I believe I shall come back to town
as fit as a Leger winner. So, farewell!
P. S. Farewell! Why, SMITH, it is an age since I saw you!
What 's the matter? Why this lameness ?— why these crutches P
Smith. Ireland.
P. S. Ireland? You don't own any property there? Oh, I
remember, you told me you had rented a salmon river over there.
Surely they didn't shoot you for that?
Smith. Shoot! I wish they had; it might have finished me off at
once. Got wet through fishing, and have been in agonies ever since.
P. S. You had no sport, then?
Smith. Yes, admirable, till this infernal thing "got hold of me.

bottom right enough.

Unnatural History.
THE Daily Telegraph has added to our knowledge of Natural
History in a truly remarkable manner. In a leading article on the
21st iust. it remarked that—
"To race n pony against a pigeon would, of course, be a foregone conclu-
sion in favour of the latter; but it has jurt been shown, by a race which has
taken place at Bed worth, that a pigeon can fly rather more than double a»
fast as a pony."
This beats dog-and-man-fighting hollow. If the Editor of the D. T.
has seen a flying pony, let him exhibit it at the Aquarium, and
FARINI and BAKNUM are not " in it." On second thoughts, we once
had a pony that flew—no, that melted away before we had time to
pocket it. But we '11 bet another pony the IJ. T. didn't mean this.

With the missing three out of the first nine

Oh, blissful duty
To explore the beauty
Of elliptic and multiple theta functions!

Must inspire ecstatics
Which should thrill an Esthete with

Must be for a Sciolist to follow you,

subject is " Door-Scrapers as Disseminators of Disease." Everyone
will at once see how essential to the Public well-being it is that
scientific scrutiny and legislative enactment should be brought to
bear on this hitherto shamefully-neglected subject. My letter will no

THE REAL REASON. .
"A foreigner, acquainted only through the medium of translations with
the works of the Author of Itasselas, might be puzzled to determine why the
name of SAMUEL JOHNSON is still with the English nation a household word,
. . . The reason is a very simple one."—Daily Telegraph.
THET may call Doctor JOHNSON a bear and a bore,
And smile at his pompous inflation;
They may laugh at nis lexicographical lore,
And BOSWELL'S absurd adulation!
But they 're bound to admit, 'mid the bustle and strife
That throbs in this busy replete street,
That he said one good thing in the course of his life—
'Twas, "Let us go walking in Fleet Street!"
If they like to abuse him for lapping up tea,
Or port at the THEALES' down at Streatham:
If with all his opinions they fail to agree,
Then all I can say is—why, let 'em!
They may jeer at Irene, vote Rasselas "rot,"
The Rambler revile in this neat street;
But there's one observation will ne'er be forgot,
'Tis, "Let us go walking in Fleet Street!"
They may carp at his " Lives" and his verse, if they please,
And sneer at his taste and his breeding:
And his essays, all written in pure Johnsonese,
They '11 reckon as ponderous reading.
But I think his detractors can't question his claim
(Oh, whisper it in this discreet street!)
To monuments, memoirs, distinction, and fame,
Is, "Let us go walking in Fleet Street!"

AN OLD POSTMAN'S STOEY.
"'Tis true, your honour! 1 'm fair dead beat, so I '11 snatch a rest on this country stile,
For I 've trudged and tramped with loaded back from county town—'tis many a mile,
Up at the hour when the cock's awake, and shuffling home when the bat's on wing,
A-oalling here, and a-calling there, with a wait for a knock, and again for a ring;
A pleasant life do you call it, Sir? to skirt the hedges and brush the dew.
To scare the pheasant, and wake the thrush, and mark the spot where violets grew.
"Well, it's all very well for the folks in town, who come down here just to take their rest;
But with chaps like me, when my labour 'B done and I long for leisure, then bed's the best.
It wasn't so bad in the days gone by, with letters tied np in a handy pack,
A stick, a satchel, a pair of legs, a sense of duty, a big broad back;
But now it's different quite, look here, when the grave is ready _and sexton host,
Let them bury me quiet, and put on the stone, 'His back it was broke by the Parcels
Post.'
"I 'm not so mad with new-fangled ways as DICK at the inn with his yard of clay.
I 've seen the scythe and sickle give in, and the railroad oome in the farmer's way;
The flail isn't heard in the old nek-yard, and the buzz of machinery frightens the nag,
And we haven't got coaches, or guards, or mails to gallop along with the postman's bag.
I haven't a doubt that the policy's good of the Liberal gentlemen sitting in town
To cheapen the cottager's packet of tea, and send on a pattern of Missus s gown:
They can forward old women their physio and stuff, in reply to an order on halfpenny cards,
Ana the men can get baccy sent up by the pound, and the women their finery easy by yards.
But what I do say, it's a little too hard to make an old messenger give up the ghost
Because he is doomed to be spoke in the wheel of the Juggernaut Car—called the Parcels Post i
"I've a son in town, as handy a lad, though I shouldn't say so, as ever you see,
And he sorts the packets and parcels out, that are driven to trains and handed to me,
And he tells his father that London's full of one-horse carriages painted red,
He owns his business hours are stiff, but he gets his meals and he likes his bed;
They tempt the lad—though he's good as gold—as very few young 'uns are tempted now,
With money, and jewels, and stamps, and cheques, which a fool might lose, but a rascal
'stow;'
And they give hinra~salary, on my word, that a labouring lad nrieht fairly scorn, —•
For Master HODGE has the air to breathe, and never sees gas whether night or morn,—
Still I think on the whole that the boy up there has a happier life—though I 'd better not
boast—
Than the labouring hack with a weight on his back, who is driven to death by the Parcels
Post!
"It stands to reason, why just look here, 'tis in rural beats where the shoe must pinch,
The orders come from the 'boss' in town, but the patient messenger he daren't flinch.
"We 've asked for a lad, or a horse and cart, whv even a tricycle many could ride,
But never a word to our mute appeal that travels to town from the country side.
They groan and growl in the London prints of packages broken and strings undone,
And kick up a fuss about chocolate-drops they nave counted out, and are short by one!
But they never can picture a man as I, of age threescore—well, and nearly ten—
"Who is taught to boast of a land that 'a free, and struggles along 'neath the whips of men.
It may be policy! Who can say? It may be economy, Statesmen's boast,
It may be life to our public men, but it's death to the slave of the Parcels Post!
"So if I am late who dares complain? and if I am weary I must sit down
Like this on a stile for a minute or two, in my daily tramp from the county town.
Sometimes I envy the birds that fly, from branch to branch, in the air that's free,
I follow the flight of the butterfly s wing, and the honeyed content of the burden d be«!
I hear the song of the labourer's lad as he rides the waggon or follows the plough,
And the robin looks up with his curious eyes as I rest for a minute to mop my brow.
In the morning mist I am off and away, to hurry despair or to hasten fate,
Leaving parcels of patterns for girls at the Hall, and letters of love at the Rectory gate;
But when your Parliament rings with cheers and the good news travels from coast to coast,
In the heat of triumph—just loose one chain from the back of the slave of the Parcels Post!"
AN ALL-ABSORBING SUBJECT.
(In the Silly Season.)
The Maze, Vague Hollow.
SIB,—As wasps are so numerous this
year, a sovereign recipe for the cure of their
stings is invaluable. I can give one. Take
twenty pounds of oranges, half a hundred-
weight of sugar, and a bottle of brandy,
and mix thoroughly. When quite assimi-
lated, boil for twenty-four hours, and then
strain off the impurities. Allow the mix-
ture to cool in a dry place, and bottle in
two-gallon jars. Cover the place containing
the sting with some of the concoction, and
a speedy cure will be secured.
Yours respectfully,
ACCURACY.
P.S.—As I like to be exact, I beg to say
the above is either an excellent recipe for
wasp-stings, or marmalade—I forget which.
The Factory, Smart Avenue.
SIR,—The only reliable cure for wasp-
stings is the Anti-Poison Rat-Killer and
Insect Neutralises It may be obtained in
boxes at one shilling and three halfpence,
three shillings and sevenpence halfpenny,
and four guineas. It is cheaper to purchase
the latter, as the price of the Government
stamp is therein included. The largest box,
too, insures a speedier cure and more instant
relief than the smaller ones. I need scarcely
say that my advice is given in a thoroughly
disinterested 'spirit. I beg to subscribe
myself, THE PATENTEE.
P.S.—Be sure you ask for the right
article, and do not be satisfied with spurious
and noxious imitations.
The Sower, Pigsville-on-Stye.
SIB,—For many years I have made the
stings of wasps my constant study. Every
day in the summer and winter months I
have the walls of all the rooms in my house
coated with a thick concoction of garlic.
The carpets are once a week washed
thoroughly with parsley-water, and all over
the place liquorice-root is kept constantly
burning. The garden is thickly sown with
onions, and all my food is flavoured with
peppermint. Finally, I have a vaporiser in
the hall, which distributes camphor in all
directions. By these simple means I
scarcely ever get stung by a wasp.
Believe me, yours very sincerely,
. . A RosEBtJD.
P.S.—I may explain that the insect in
question has a very sensitive sense of smell.
Onlv a mad wasp would approach my
dwelling, and a mad w'asp has rarely brains
enough to sting.
TWILL NOT DO.
"Why has not man a microscopic eye?
For this plain reason, Man is not a fly."
SANG POPE with complacent optimistic dogmatism. But that's all
knocked on the head now. Since Science turned social detective,
Man has a microscopic eye, or its equivalent. The ignorance which
is bliss is now no man 'a lot. "A PRACTICAL CHEMIST" assures us
that the Turkey-red twill, which is largely used for lining dressing-
gowns and making children's frocks, is heavily loaded with the
chlorides of calcium and magnesium, which absorb water " eagerly"
from the atmosphere, insuring a damp state of the clothing except in
the driest weather. Delicious! How little did we know, when
donning our (seemingly) snug dressing-gown that we were clothing
ourselves with rheumatism as with a garment. Oh, that twill be
joyful! It there anything in our daily life, from socks to champagne,
from drains to dressing-^owns, that is not a serious danger to health t
And is life worth living with this detective-delineated modern'' Dance
of Death " continually going on around us?
RAMPANT RIBBONOSITY.
A MAN no longer wears his heart upon his sleeve, but he carries a
certificate of good morals in his button-hole. We read in the Daily
2?eu>s (Sept. 20)—
"At Boscombe Down. Wilts, yesterday, the first anniversary of the ' Red
Kibbon Army' was celebrated. The Army is composed of 'moderate
drinkers.' A dinner was given, and the aOair was one of great rejoicing."
The following little song might have been sung on the occasion:—
Moderation is Carnation, I If ribbonless, I must confess,
Abstinence is Blue:
I wonder what are you P
He who wears no ribbon whatever in the present day is 'most
assuredly open to the gravest suspicion. No doubt the adoption of

PAFNFTTL MEETING BETWEEN MRS. STANLEY GREEN AND MRS. DE LA POER
BROWN, WHO HAVE ALWAYS MADE A POINT OF CONCEALING FROM EACH OTHER
THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF THEIR DRESSMAKER.
A STARTLING INVENTION.
THE baby does not seem to take to the electric feeding-
bottle. He is now in strong convulsions.
From the fact that my new electric razor nearly severed
my jugular vein this morning, I conclude that the cur-
rent must be turned on a little too strong.
It certainly is a great blessing to have one's coffee
ground, the carpets dusted, the hot water brought up-
stairs, all the clocks in the house wound up, and the
front-door slammed in the face of the Tax-Collector,
simply by turning a small handle down in the wine-
cellar.
We really must impress on our next housemaid that
the proper way to light the Swan burner in the hall is
not oy grasping both wires firmly, previous to applying
a match to the ends,—or the hospital Authorities may
refuse to receive any more of our cases.
Now that the electric boot-cleaner has torn the but-
tons from my best out-door pair of boots, and scorched
all the French polish off my dress-shoes, I think we
may call the contrivance an unqualified success.
I am sure my mother-in-law would like to sleep in the
room with the "New Patent Electric Surprise Bedstead"
in it.
The "Little Marvel" machine which turns me out of
bed, puts my clothes on, gives me my breakfast, and
propels me in the direction of the railway station five
minutes before the morning train starts, had better be
set for half-past nine o'clock to-morrow.
The "Electric Family-Prayer Reader " must certainly
be out of order, as it has given us the same chapter of
Genesis for the last three mornings.
Judging from the livid appearance of the cook, who is
now lying insensible under the kitchen table, I fancy
that in trying to light what she calls "that there
dratted lamp, she must have unintentionally "com-
pleted the circuit."
THE colour specially emblematic of the Esthete is
sage-green. Could anything be more appropriate?
Just a tinge of the sage and very much of the green for
the pupil, but for the "master" the proportion of colour
is reversed.
NO PLACE LIKE HOME.
(An Apology for the Refusal of an Intended Favour.)
MY DEAR MOTJNTJOLLY,
IF I could possibly have the pleasure of accepting the kind
invitation you have so often repeated, to stay with you for a holiday,
at your fine old country mansion, I certainly would. I thank yon
for it very much indeed. But it is quite impossible for me to leave
home with any pleasure, or indeed any comfort at all. No doubt a
change of air and scene would do me an immense amount of good;
and, if there is any move I can imagine I should like to make, it
would be a transition from duckweed Cottage to Hernshaw Hall.
But even that would be absolutely intolerable to me. Why? Because
I could not, I assure you, make myself at home, as you kindly sav I
might, without becoming intolerable to you and everybody else
about me.
At home, in the first place, I am accustomed to lie in bed of a
morning as long as I choose, generally thinking some subject or other
out, sometimes until it is very late, so that I am not up and down
until mid-day. To breakfast with any degree of comfort, I must
breakfast alone, have nobody to mind and nothing to distract my
attention from my repast, and from reading the newspapers. By
way of condiment to my food, I always use garlic, partly because I
like it, partly for its pulmonic properties, and it would be selfish of
me to satisfy this taste otherwise than quite by myself. Besides,
garlic, chopped fine, pervades the house.
Alone, indeed, I require to be, reading or writing, the greater Dart
of almost every day, and, whenever I wish, to be able to fight a pipe,
and smoke a whiff of tobacco. I need, also, a sitting-room or study
so far apart from the rest of the house that I may remain out of
hearing anv ordinary conversation, especially small-talk interlarded
with tittering and laughter.
You fancy, perhaps, that I should as a rule at least make myself
tolerably pleasant at dinner, because yon may have usually found me
so. But_that was when I was dining out, which I only do just now
and again, on occasion. I am then, perhaps, able to sustain a
temporary part in society, and seem lively and even brilliant for a
little while, being to that extent under the influence of intoxicating
liquors, Champagne and other, which would not do every day; and
the slightest excess commonly costs me a headache the next morning.
Dining' dailv with other people I should be dreadfully dull; more-
over, I could not stand having to dress regularly for dinner.
Furthermore, I must dine at my own time, and can't observe a
stated dinner-hour, or any other hours.
As soon as I have dine'd I habitually smoke my pipe again, and
for the rest of the night alternate smoking with reading. As to the
practice of going upstairs into a drawing-room, and listening to trivial
singing and playing the piano—it would be penal servitude to me. I
shoula very soon desire a glass of grog, and to be off to bed. The fore-
going avowals I trust will serve to convince you that to accept your
generously-proffered hospitality would bo only to abuse it, and form—
very bad form, indeed—the grossest ingratitude on the part of your
truly thankful, but sincere, and thoroughly candid friend,
SNUGGLES.
LITIGATION AND LOGIC.
SOME space has been filled in the first of the Papers
By an action of import to dressmakers, drapers,
And tailors,-^-of course, without saying that goes;
For the suit is a suit with relation to clo'es.
Mis-stated, however, a little this case is
In being reported as " Hips versus Braces."
Let it Hips versus Shoulders" be, Logic implores,
Or " Belt vertus Braces "—to go on all fours.
The points of support one another may sue.
The supporters implead the supporters with due
Consistency, but, 'twixt the former and latter,
Nisi Prius is quite an incongruous matter.
Yet " Belt versus Braces " suggests a late cause,—
It reminds every reader of BELT versus LAWES;
And, although as for "keeping " it yields satisfaction.
Must make us all yawn who remember that action.

Ali (hesitatingly). I am so poor, my Lord; but I think I might
spare a calf if my Lord would then let me go!
Smith Pasha (sternly). Be a man, Sir, and don't talk folly!
Comfi, now, you surely can serve upon a Jury—give a verdict to say
whether a prisoner is innocent or guilty, don t you know?
Ali. But why should I do that, my Lord? It would only offend
the Judge, if he had arranged with the prisoner.
Smith Pasha (emphatically). Haven t I told you, Sir, that the
Judge cannot be bought!
Ali (submissively). As my Lord pleases! I am my Lord's slave!
Smith Pasha (aside). On my word, I believe he is hopeless! Stay,
I will give him a last chance. (Aloud.) After all, my poor man,
your education is answerable for your want of public spirit. How-
ever, I think you will still do for a Vestryman. Procuring paying
contracts for your friends, and utterly ignoring the convenience of
the ratepayers, are simple acts enough—eh? Surely you could per-
form such duties as these?
Ali. I would try, my Lord; I would try; but surely such work
would be better done by an Englishman?
Smith Pasha. No doubt! So it would! Well, I can't waste any
more time upon you, as I have to see some of your neighbours about
a new School Board, a projected Tramway, and a plan for Gasworks.
I suppose that your neighbours are much the same as you, eh?
Ah (proudly). No, my Lord; I am more learned than my neigh-
bours. If I were not, why should they call me "The Star of
Wisdom "? (Returning to his submissive manner.) Your pardon,
my Lord! May my tongue be out out for its boasting!
Smith Pasha. They callyow " The Star of Wisdom!" Then they
must be a bright set! Well, good day. May look in again by-
and-by. [Exit.
Ali (grovelling). All good wishes follow you, my Lord! (After a
pause.) And yet he has left me without taking my calf or goat!

A GLASS AT THE GLOBE.
"I warrant 'twill prove an excuse for the glass !"—School for Scandal.
MB. GBUNDY'S Glass of Fashion, in spite of certain defects, is
a clever piece, capitally played, and well worth seeing.
The Author had got hold of a good subject for Comedy, but he
unfortunately took too serious a view of its treatment, and has
attempted

serious,
should
to be
severely
when he
only have raised a
genuine laugh in
which all alike
could most heartily
have joined. The
"serious motive"
is not sufficiently
important to sus-
tain the interest,
and the strikingly
dramatic scenes
are,—with one ex-
ception in the
Second Act,—made
so melodramatic in
tone and action by
Miss LINGABD as
to give them the
appearance of hav-
ing been "written
'Organic Life,"—a suggestion for a new turn to be u?" SpeCiaUy f°r
given to the situation in that peculiarly-shaped Lf^
Chair in Act II. The exception
above mentioned
where Miss LINGABD is not only seen at her best in this piece, but we
venture to say at her best altogether, is in the interview between
Colonel and Mrs. Trevanion in the Second Act. Here we have
nothing but praise for her, as we should have for the Colonel through-
out, did not Mr. LETHCOUBT represent him as such a very brusque
unpleasant person, own brother, in fact, to that wooden-headed, steel-
jointed Colonel (we think he is a Colonel, and an Indian Colonel,—
they generally are in these pieces) in Impulse at the St. James's.
The Glass of Fashion, if the idea had only struck Mr. GBUNDY in
tune, ought to have been what is now known as a " Criterion Piece;"
and, without detracting one whit from Mr. SHINE'S excellent, because
most natural, performance of the rich Brewer who has married a
Countess, and who wants to "have Society at his feet," yet how
immense Mr. W. HILL would have been as the proprietor of the
newspaper worried by threatening letters, actions, writs, and all the
ills that the conduct of his Editor has entailed upon him.~ If the
Editor had only
been Mr. WYSD-
HAM, and had (l^ /21 i J
these two parts
been evenly
balanced, Mr.
STANDINQ the
Colonel, and Miss
ROBKE the Wife,
then with Mr.
BEEBBOHM TBEE
as the Polish
Prince Borow-
ski, and that most
piquante and
clever of little
women, Miss L.
VENNE, in her
present part of
Pea O f£eiUy,
and Miss CAB-
LOTTA LECLEKCQ
as Lady Coombe.
the piece would have gone with roars of laughter from beginning to
end. As it is, indeed, the portions that go best,—and these cannot
go better,—are just those where the fun comes in, and where the
dialogue is so carefully pointed that every line tells.
Putting aside the First Act as patchy and comparatively uninter-
esting, the other three Acts are very good both as to dialogue and
construction.
It is a pity that the ingenious contrivance of substituting one
sister for the other did not receive a little more attention from the
Author, either when writing or when rehearsing, as some sort of
reason ought to have been invented to account for Peg O'Reilly not
going away with her sister. Why Peg should stop, we cannot see,

She lingers,—no, she Lingard on the threshold. Kun!
Venne? Now! Curtain.
except to meet her affiance. Tom Stanhope (very well played by Mr.
SMILY), and even then, she wouldn't have hid herself behind a
curtain. This is not hypereriticism, but only a regret that what is,
as it stands, so good, should not have been perfect.
Mr. TBEE's make-up as Prince Borowski is admirable; his identity
is completely obliterated; it is even difficult to recognise him by his
eyes. It is not a pleasant part, and, no doubt, to raise it above the
level of the usual conventional foreign scoundrel with broken
English, Mr. TBEE over-accentuates the repulsiveness of the
character in the Studio Scene, where he exhibits not love," as Mrs.
Trevanion truly says, but passion—of such a kind as Mr. CLAYTON
thought it right to
portray in his scene as
Joseph Surface with
Lady Teazle. I am not
sure but that both
artists are correct in
theory, but the piece
should be a Tragedy,
that is, tragic motives
should be at work, to
warrant such a display
of brutal energy.
Mr. SHINJ?S John
Macadam grows upon
us as the piece pro-
ceeds. It is a very
natural piece of acting,
but, for all that, the
manner of the Actor,
not of the character he
is playing, appears to
be hard. Still, it is

Mr. Shyin' making a Hit.
very funny; and the funnier the scenes between him and his
Editor become—the greater the difficulties in which he finds him-
self, the more we regretted that it had not occurred to Mr. GBTTNDY
to make this into a farcical comedy, when, we believe, it would have
achieved as great a success as Our Soys.
As it is, with "the return of the native " to town, the Comedy
ought to have a considerable share of public favour accorded to it.
The Theatres are all waking up after their summer rest. Mr.
HABBIS'S Freedom has come to an end at Drury Lane. The next
piece will, we hope, be Paydom. His advertisement raises our
curiosity, the piece being announced as founded on facts " privately
known to the Authors. What can these be? Some startling dis-
closures about the Messrs, GATTI, or about Messrs. PETTITT and
MEBBITT (with all the "i's" and " t's" possible), or—but we dare
not venture upon further surmise. We have been authoritatively
informed that there is to be a real horse on the stage, and a real
murder. We firmly credit both statements.

SUEVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.
(Latest development, as imagined by Our Overwrought Contributor.)
"The Sheriffs of London and Middlesex were yesterday occupied in
examining a number of persona who had written, offering themselves as can-
didates for the office of Hangman. The Sheriffs having seen all the candi-
dates, five were requested to remain."—Daily Paper.
SCENE—A room in the Old Bailey. The Sheriffs discovered seated
at a table on which are several plaster-casts of heads, and a pile
of rope. To the right .a full-sized temporary gallows. Opposite
them, finishing a stiff Examination Paper, the five seleateaCan-
didates, two of whom, unable to write, are assisted by private

knot)—I thought if your Worships would like to see what I could do

and ring a dustman's bell, until Candidate Number One it
removed by seven Ushers. Order being restored, and the
Sheriffs, after having had a pint of Champagne a-piece and
hidden the fire-irons, an inkstand, and a bust o/BlACXSTONE
in the waste-paper basket, the Second Candidate is summoned,
and requested to detail his experiences as briefly as possible.
Candidate Number Two (briskly). \Vell, no, Gents,—I never have
myself, though, I 've been watching it for ft vc-and-thirty years so
as to be ready whenever I had a chance. This is my idea. (The
Sheriffs grow interested, and nod approvingly.) It 'a to do it like
Punch and Judy.

I see you are a humanitarian.

applying for the post of Public Hangman. I should exceedingly
like occasionally to try to hang someone painlessly, and if one of you
Gentlemen now, would kindly step up here [Mounts the scaffold.
The Sheriff of London. Up there? Hum! ha! We think perhaps
a Common Councilman would serve your purpose better; and—er—
ahem!—we will be happy to assist you in the process.

bound hand and foot, and placed under the drop, loudly
and violently protesting.
Candidate Number Three (explaining). There is not the least
cause for apprehension—a mere experiment. [Tries to hang him.
Common Councilman. Look here! If I 'm hung, by Jove, it 'a
murder!
[Shouts frantically for help; and, after a desperate struggle,
in which the plaster-casts are used freely as missiles, escapes
icith Candidate Number Three and the Two Sheriffs to
the nearest Police- Court, where, having all taken out cross-
summonses against each other, and made it up afterwards,
the Sheriffs return, and find Candidate Number Four sus-
pended on the gallows in tht examination-room.
The Sheriff of Middlesex. Dear me! and his papers were quite
promiainfr! However, there's one left. (Summons Candidate Number
rive.) Well, now, just tell us what you know about the matter.
Candidate Number Five. Well, it was this way, your Worship.
We got practising a little bit in a friendly way together, and I said,
"I 'a got a new dodge;" and so says he, "Snow it me," says he;
and I done it.
The Sheriff of London (rising). And very nicely done, too.
The Sheriff of Middlesex. Quite so. This admirable practical
exercise, taken in connection with your very well answered papers,
decides us—the post is yours.
Candidate Number Five. Thankee, kindly, your Honours! I hope
I may live long, and have lots of work, and enjoy myself!
The Sheriffs (both together). I'm sure we hope you may.

they call "liberty," we Minute Philosophers shall never fulfil our

us do it. But the obstinacy of the unphilosophical mind is inscru-

Encyclopaedia, from " Alcohol" to "Zymotic Diseases." FUSTILUO,
of course, made himself obstructive. Pretended he couldn't see the
connection between my thesis and his precious " Braces and Garters,"

however, and I believe we should have come to a general agreement

SUBSIDISED SCIENCE.
THOUGH the general reader of light and screaming literature must
have felt a good deal depressed at the sudden termination last week
of the labours of the British Association, still he must have gathered
some comfort from the cheery and handsome manner in which the
whole aifair was wound up.
The grants of money to the various scientific branches for the
ensuing year were no sooner proposed than they were approved of
with enthusiasm, and in a very short time cheques were literally
flying all over the place. At first sight there may appear to have
been a little capriciousness ia their distribution, as some of the
subjects, for no very serious reason, appear, in the matter of endow-
ment, to have come ofi considerably worse than others.
For instance, while Mr. R. ETHERIDGE was offered £75 down to go
off to Japan to see an earthquake,—a very fair allowance for a
return-ticket third-class,—and Sir J. HOOKER declined to be got rid
of in "the mountains of Equatorial Africa" under a cool £500,
Professor E. HALL was set down for a paltry £15 for investigating
the ".Circulation of Underground 'Waters," a very disagreeable and
hazardous piece of business; and if the Association—as it probably
did—refused to throw in his diving-dress as well, one, we should
say, likely to .be conducted by the learned Professor at a positive
financial loss.
Again, £10 was considered ample pay to Professor PBESTWICH for
what looks like a most exhausting and irritating enterprise—the
pursuit of " Erratic Blocks;" while, under the head of " Mechanical
Science," Sir F. BBAMWELL had to close the list with a modest five-
pound note for himself. This surely is a little shabby.
Still, spite these capriciously fantastic bits of economy, the success
of the Association's efforts has, on the whole, been undeniable, and
it is highly satisfactory to know that nearly all the members of the
Committee, who were sent quite off their heads by Professor CAYLEY'S
opening address, are now said to be so far improving as to be only
occasionally delirious. Indeed, some are already looking forward
with a feeble smile to taking, with the sanction of their friends, an
active part in the forthcoming proceedings of the Association at
Montreal, next year. We wish them every success.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ANOTHER LITTLE HOLIDAY CRUISE.
Sailing—Discussion—Music—Evenings below—Arrival—Oban —
Ashore —Novelty.
CRAYLEY always has a glass out looking for Ben Nevis. He is quite
annoyed at not seeing it somewhere.
"I know it 'a there!" he exclaims, quite pettishly, after keeping
a telescope to his eye for a quarter-of-an-hour, as though Ben Nevis
were playing hide and seek with him, and getting out of his way just
for the fun of the thing.
MELLEVILLE politely explains that Ben Nevis is not visible for the
same reason that the British Fleet couldn't be seen by Tilburina.
KILLICK gives it as his geographical opinion that Ben Nevis is in
Wales." Maps are instantly produced, and the exact situation of
Ben Nevis settled.
"Well," says KILLICK, "I suppose I was thinking of some other
Ben. Let me see, isn't there a JBen Davis somewhere? I'm sure
I 've heard the name, but, at this moment, I can't remember whether
it 's a man or a mountain."
_ MELLEVILLE fancies that he has heard the name before in legal
circles, and inclines to the opinion that the Ben in question is not
a mountain in Wales, but an eminent Solicitor. "But," he adds, by
way of compromise, probably of Welsh extraction."
Being referred to, I am unable to solve the difficulty. A quotation
occurs to me—" Davis sum, non (Edipus "—but, as I don't quite see
how to bring it in, I leave it in a pigeon-hole (so to speak) to be
called for when wanted. If my own name had been DAVIS, the
quotation would have been most apt. Might tell it of a Qentleman
in a railway-carriage whose name happened to be DAVIS, and who
had been appealed to by strangers to decide the point.
Our Evenings on Board.—Our host is a fair musical amateur,
understanding the theory of the art, up in all the modern contro-
versies as to Music, au fait with the works of the best Composers,
ancient and modern, with a general cosmopolitan liking for whatever
is tuneful and melodious all round. He has German proclivities, is a
strict mathematician, a scholarly classic, and, bringing all this learn-
ing and talent to bear on Music, he is scientifically musical, but
slightly inaccurate in illustration.
CRAYLEY is a first-rate listener to music, with his glass in his eye,
and always sideways, like a parrot hearing a tune. His memory fails
him for names of airs and their Composers, and it usually plays him
false after he has once started an air. He has all the notes, out he
wants tuning. He says that he learnt Music in his early child-
hood—when he detested nothing more thoroughly than music-lessons,
from the fact of their having mulcted him 01 his play-time.
"It was play-time," puts in KILLICK, an interruption of which
CEATLET takes no sort of notice.
CRATLEY now plays, he says, sometimes when he is alone; remind-
ing KII.LICK (he tells me) of the Cockney, in one of SEYMOUR'S cari-
catures, who liked to go a 'unting all by himself, 'cos then nobody
can't laugh 1" Very nearly being "a difficulty" here between
CRAYLEY and KILLICK.
My own musical knowledge is, like Mr. Sam Welter's knowledge
of London, "extensive and pecxiliar." It consists, whether vocally
or instrumentally. of " snatches" generally.
KILLICK is an obstinate Musician. Whatever he plays, and how-
ever he plays it, that must be right,—no matter what the weight of
evidence might be. He has composed and published three songs,
words and music, all his own; and under the non de plume of ".VAL
TRAVEBS," has written the words which have been set by rising
Composers. He is invariably obstinate at the piano, and so, when
any one of us asks him to play some particular tune, he will pay no
attention to the request, but will at once proceed to play some-
thing totally different.
With these elements of harmony among us, we are never at a loss
for an entertaining evening. As we can all play, the one who gets
first to the piano sticks to it until he is either forcibly removed, or
yields to a united protest from the majority.
The one who is at the piano is never permitted for any length of
time to play what he likes, unless that tune happens to suit everybody
else's taste. As a rule, no sooner has KILLICK, who generally gets to
the instrument first, taken his seat and performed that sort of up-and-
down prelude which acts as a preliminary canter to the fingers,
than CRAYLEY, who is lying at full length on a sofa, reading his inter-
minable French novel and smoking a pipe, and to whom it can be a
matter of no sort of consequence what tune is being played as long as
it doesn't disturb him, says, "I wish you "d play that thing from—
dear me—what's the name of the Opera "—KILLICK gives no sign of
attention—" oh, you know it—with—who's the great tenor singer in
it?" "SIMS REEVES?" suggests our host. ?1 What Opera?" I
ask. "Oh," says CBAYLEY, quite annoyed with us for not remember-
ing what he can't recollect—^'it begins"—here he tries to hum it,
but, getting mixed up with KILLICK'S tune on the piano, he declares
it's impossible to recall it while KILLICI is playing. "Well!"
KTLLICK, suddenly stopping, and looking round defiantly.
says
"Now—
what is it?" But CHAYLET is not prepared, he can't even call to
mind how the tune starts.
And so he is a failure, much to KILLICK'S delight, who " chortles
in his joy,"—he is the only man I ever heard really " chortle." which
is a sound something between a half laugh and a sly chuckle,—and
our host avails himself of the opportunity to ask KILLICK if he
remembers the duet from Lohengrin, beginning but just at this
point MELLEVLLLE'S memory plays him a trick, and he can't for the
life of him recollect what a second ago he could have hummed or
played perfectly. He tries a few notes, throwing them out as a bait
to attract the real ones from somewhere in KILLICK'S musical know-
ledge-box. KILLICK, however, only shakes his head impatiently to
signify that he can't make out what MELLEVILLE means, and sets
to work to play just what pleases himself, without reference to any-
body else, whereupon he, our host, and myself commence an animated
discussion on the music of the last five years, each giving his own
illustration in humming of things he likes best. CRAYLEY, unable
to pay any very close attention to his novel, puts it down, and joins
in our conversation, which we all know must be very trying to
KILLICK, who, however, dare not leave off playing, or one of_us
would at once possess himself of the piano. So, without stopping
to get down fresh music, he sings and plays some songs from
memory, and, as they are entirely uncalled for, his audience make
a point of keeping up a conversation, which becomes more and
more animated every minute. The piano wins as a rule, unless one
of us asks another to "sing something," to which the immediate
response is, " Yes; if you don't mind playing it for me,"—whereupon
somebody taps KILLICK on the shoulder, and says, " I say, old boy,"
in the most genial and polite tone, "just let MELLEVILLE come and
accompany CBAYLEY •—he's going to sing "•—and, with a very bad
grace, KILLICK quits his chair at the piano, and "he plays no more
that night."
Later on, we get to cards, when CRAYLEY, who is very par-
ticular on the score of health, looks at his watch, which examina-
tion invariably results in his asking everyone else "What the real
time is," and, having struck a balance in favour of bed-time, he
retires for the night. This punctuality he seems to consider a
panacea for his indulgence during the day in everything which he
says at the time he oughtn't to take, but which he can't resist—
specially pastry with jam, rich cake, and any kind of fruit, fresh or
preserved. His rule of health seems to be, "It doesn't matter what
you eat or drink, if you only go to bed early every night." How-
ever, as nearly every morning he complains of having suifered
from nightmare (in which he has been thrown down precipices, and
never arrived at the bottom), or has risen with a headache, or sees
black specks floating before his eyes,—the only remedy at breakfast
for this being chops, ham, jam, heavy Scotch cake hot and honey,—it
doesn't seem as if this regularity in retiring to bed early was so
entirely successful as he would have us believe.
We arrive at Oban. MELLEVILLE doesn't know whether we shall
stay here any time or not. Whereupon KILLICK describes this as
"an Oban question." CBAYLEY looks as disgusted as Dr. JOHNSON
might have done if BOSWELL had ventured on such &jeu de mot. _
With great alacrity we go ashore to take exercise, make inquiries
at the post-office, wander about and look at the shops, and subse-
quently dine at trie hotel. It is quite a novel sensation to dine at a
large table in a gorgeous room, attended upon by waiters in white
ties. It is as if we nad suddenly discovered civilisation. But also,
curious to observe, how glad we all are to be once more ashore. But
we 've got the Hebrides still before us.
VERY HmifPTJDENT. — The Hymn in Italian by Mr. GLADSTONE
has stirred up a few Italians. They say they don't want his hymn:
let him keep his hymn to hymnself. ITALIA says she has got a
hundred andTfifty hymns that are all hers. The probability of the
PREMIER'S reading "the Lessons" in church on Sunday, always
attracts a large audience—beg pardon, we should have said congrega-
tion, but that the account next day reads much the same as a report
of a " Patti night" at the Opera,—and if "in quires and places where
they sing" the PREMIER could only be induced to give a solo of his
own in Italian, with translation into English by the clerk, what a
rush there 'd be for stalls,—no, beg pardon again,—pews and free
seats! There are "stalls" at theatres, operas, cathedrals, and
stables, not in parish churches.
A CORRESPONDENT forwards to us the following Advertisement
which appeared in the Times of Sept. 15th :—

He adds, " I should have sent it to you before, only that I 've been

PATENTS AND PENNIES.
COVENT Garden Theatre is
the only playhouse in London
that can fairly claim to be
Royal. It works under a
patent granted by CHARLES
THE SECOND to KILLIGRKW and
DAVENANT, and though Drury
Lane makes a doubtful claim
to half of this patent, there
is no question as to Covent
Garden possessing it. This
being the case, the 'AHEY of
the period ought to feel doubly
grateful that he is admitted
into this Temple of Music for
something very like a penny.
If the money were tendered at
the door it would not be re-
ceived, except in the form of
a ten-and-sixpenny season-
ticket; and a ticket at this
price, extending over three or
four months, reduces our great
Opera-House to something like
a "Penny Gaff." Is not this
Penny-wise and Pound-foolish?

HOUSE.—" Our Buoys!"
SOME SINGULAR DISCLOSURES.
(Highly interesting to Travellers by Bail.)
THERE is considerable mjrstery attached to the so-called "Bye-
Laws " of Railway Companies. The public generally knows them
only through vague and menacing references thereto upon the backs
of tickets, and on occasionally visible notices and posters. Very
dreadful things would seem to be possible under cover of the extra-
legal authority they are supposed to confer; and the mild-spirited
traveller generally has a disquieting, indefinite sense of what may,
in certain or uncertain contingencies, be done to him " in accordance
with the Company's Bye-Laws." An observant, if gentle, Railway
traveller of many years' experience, furnishes the following as being
clearly among the chief canons—whether written or unwritten—of
this mysterious code :—
1. FARES.—Twice one are—for Railway purposes—anything the
Directors may please, from tioo-and-a-half upwards.
Under this elastic rule some very amusing arithmetical feats are
possible. A fourth dimension of space would not more confuse the
calculations of the ordinary commercially-trained mind than does
the Railway rule of proportion. Under it the distance travelled is,
of course, no sort of criterion of the charge to be made—none what-
ever. That is the humour of it. This—so to say—transcendental
treatment, lends to Railway matters all the subtle charm of the
unexpected, and floors the inquisitive Gradgrinds among the Public
who are always wanting to apply rules and draw inferences and
things. If the fare from one Station to another is sixpence, you
must not go concluding that the fare to a third Station, midway
between the two, will therefore be threepence or thereabouts—
nothing of the sort; it will probably be the same, and possibly more.
In fact, the Euclidian '' therefore " is totally inapplicable to Railway
arrangements, which are not based upon ordinary mathematics or
accepted logic. For instance, in railway journeys the whole is not
necessarily equal to the sum of its parts; it may be more or less,
according to,—well, it is impossible to say what it is according to,—
chance, caprice, humour, rule of thumb, whatever you please or don't
please. One thing only is certain—it is not according to reason.
2. TIM i:.—Time is a figment of men's fancy, and has no fixed measure.
Time is treated by Rail way dom in the same transcendental way
as Space and Number. Railway Time it a figment. It is also a
joke. The mind, however, must be what the higher criticism calls
"detached" to appreciate that joke. The passenger who, being
informed that a certain train, which it is important for him to catch,
starts at 5'30, who, emerging from the refreshment-room at 5'26
exactly, sees three clocks pointing, respectively, to 5'25, 5'29, and
5'34, who dashes to the gate, only to be informed that the train
started five minutes ago,—this traveller will probably not have his
mind sufficiently detached " to enjoy the humour of the situation."
That is, of course, the traveller's own fault,—or misfortune. The
Company provides all the materials of the jest, but no "Bye-Laws"
can compel the Public to appreciation. Otherwise, Theatres, comic
journals, 'party speeches, and Art criticisms would be superfluous,
the Railway Companies, under cover of this particular Rule of theirs,
supplying enough "fun" for the whole community.
3. SPACE.—Space is Infinite Elasticity, and has no measure but the
mind and conscience of JRailtcayaom, of which, indeed, it is the
type.
This law—or definition—will only appear transcendental to those
who have never travelled by rail. The Schoolmen who debated the
question as to how many angels could dance on the point of a needle,

RAILWAY PUZZLE.
HOW TO CRAM ANY NUMBER OF PERSONS INTO A SECOND-CLASS COMPARTMENT" INTENDED TO ACCOMMODATE ElOHT PASSENGERS
UNCOMFORTABLY. THE OFFICIALS ON THE LONG JOURNEY-DUE-NORTH LlNES HAVE, ON OCCASION, NEARLY SUCCEEDED IN SOLVING THE
PROBLEM. WITH OTHER LINES, ON SUCH SPECIAL OCCASIONS AS GREAT RACE DAYS, THIS PUZZLE HAS ALMOST CEASED TO OFFER
ANY DIFFICULTY.
would find a kindred and congenial theme in the question, "how
many third-class passengers can be crammed into a first-class car-
riage f" It could never, of course, be decided—which would be the
beauty of it. The Rule itself is designed with an ingenious aptness
which is subtly exquisite. Under it a compartment constructed—
avowedly—to accommodate" ten, may be made to contain thirty
and upwards. There must be an esoteric Bye-Law of this sort, or
else appeal to the exoteric rule painted, in plain letters, in the com-
partment itself, would surely confound even the conscience of a
Railway Director. Which it "does not. Q. E. D.
4. CLASS.—Class is an unreal or arbitrary distinction, maintained—
theoretically, or at pleasure—for financial purposes. Its relation
to charge is fixed, but as to accommodation shifting, or non-
existent at official will.
The contemplation of this Bye-Law will throw light on many
questions that hnve long puzzled the gentle passenger, and even
elicited from him many pathetic but fruitless plaints. The rule—
like charity—covers a multitude of (Railway) sins. In its light the
sight of a score of low, foul-mouthed third-class betting-men
crammed into a first-class compartment with two or three mild citi-
zens or gently-born Ladies who have paid high first-class fare for
the sake of essential quiet and comfort,—this sight, I say, no longer
confounds, though it may displease. No rational person will hence-
forth ask why one railway carriage should be clean and comfortable,
while another, of the same " class" (nominally) is dirty and purga-
torial. The question rather is, Why should it it not be thus, if it
suit the interest or caprice of the managers of the line? The word
"class"—in the sense of the Bye-Law—^xplains all anomalies and
discrepancies. If you fancy that in paying for a first-class ticket,
you secure the exclusive possession of BO much space (which see) in a
well-appointed first-class carriage, to the exclusion of crowding,
uncleanliness in person, garb, and speech, noise and nastiness gene-
rally, why, you are much mistaken, that is all. And though natural
distaste of such surroundings may be permitted you, in silence, yet
any outspoken disappointment or disgust must spring from ignorance
of the above Law, and of the esoteric meaning of the terms in
Railwaydom's vocabulary.
Various other minor members of the great mysterious " Bye-Law"
family has our Correspondent deduced from long experience by the
aid of plain logic. Some of them may be given to the public on a
future occasion. These, however, are the leading, and, so to say,
covering enactments of the secret and terrible code. Their publica-
tion may explain many maddeningly puzzling experiences of the
Railway traveller, and—perhaps — lead that long-suffering and
befogged personage to intelligent and effectual revolt.
Report from Southport.
"Dr. CARPENTER expressed the very deep interest with which he had
listened to these communications, because they went to the very fundamental
conception of life that they had been gradually coming to from the days
when he was taught that cells were everything."
THE days when he was taught that " cells were everything," must
have been his schooldays, when a sharp boy premised every answer
with " bar sell!" as a precautionary measure. Dr. CARPENTER will
still find that "cells are everything," or nearly so, if he goes into
the Stock Exchange when there's not much business doing.

SOME STARTLING BAGS ON THE MOORS!
BACK TO LONDON.
BACK to London, in September,
When they "re threshing out the wheat,
Pleasant is it to remember
How your holidays were sweet.
Now those halcyon days are past,
All Lawn Tennis setts you won done,
And you 're glad to be at last—
Back in London.
Back to all accustomed duties,
Dearer for the hours of play,
Visions of the sea-side beauties,
Seem like dreams of yesterday.
Haply with reluctant mind.
Now you know all rural fun done,
Yet you 're glad yourself to find
Back in London.
Town looks pleasant after places
That were just a trifle slow;
All the old familiar faces
Greet you wheresoe'er you go.
Holidays are, you '11 agree,
Very like a child's plum bun done,
And you 're very pleased to be
Back in London.
MBS. RAMSBOTHAM has taken the greatest interest in
the reports of the British Association meetings. She
wants to know if Bacteria is the scientific name for
lumbago, as, if BO, she's got it.
MY LONG WAKAYSHUN.
I FIXDS myself a spending my Long'Wakayshun of a hole week at
Surbiton, of all places in the world. Scrumpshus Surbiton, as its
ushally called, and quite rite too. for I never seed with my pare of
old eyes such a swell place. As I m told they calls the Town where
they makes the werry best silk welwet the City of Paleasses, so I
shoud call this reelly Dutiful place the Burrow of helegant Willars.
There doesn't seem >to be such a thing as a Porehouse or a pore
person in the hole place, and that's jest what I likes. I dislikes
with a most bitter dislike anything like powerty! They 're a reglar
complanin lot is the pore, at the best of times, and not the least use
in the world to an Hed Waiter. They don't want no waiting on,
they don't. They can wait on theirselves, they can, and likes it
better, and as to harf-crowns, they don't seem to know the proper
use on 'em, even wen they as 'em.
I chose Surbiton with one eye to pleasure and one to busyness.
howdaciously expensive one wen 1 strikes the ballanse.
I 've took lojjmgs with a werry respectable Gent in the Sweep
line, and I offen has a ride with him of a mornin in his little hoarse
and shay when he gos his perfeshnal rounds, and its quite emusing
to me to jine him in his musical and plaintif cry of Sweep! Sweep!
jest like two overgrown Blackbirds whose woices has got jest a leetle
ropy. We was a little bit unlukkv at fust as we had the Plummers in
the house for 2 days, and all I will say is, that if the other Hartysans
of the town is all like the Plummers, they must be remarkable fine
spesimums of noisy humannity. "Hammer an Tongs" was nothin
to 'em. WILLIAM says there's a line of SHAKSPEEH'S as discribes
'em ecksakly: '' Guns, Trumpits, Blunderbusses, Drums, and
Thunder!" We 've been all right since, ekscept jest a little trubbel
with the Painters up stares, so I mustn't grumbel.
To return to my muttins, as the French says, I should think Surbi-
ton must be about as neer to what I should expeo Parrydice to be, as
you can reasonably expeo only 12 miles from London. In the first
place we 've got jest 49 trains a day to take us home, and tho' of
course I shan t want one on 'em, excep wen I goes away, and then it
will be a pretty job to know which to choose, still its a great cumfit
to know that there they is if vou happens to want 'em, and, as I 'm
pretty close to the line, I has the pleasure of hearing 'em parse, up or
down, about every five minnits all day, and nearly all nite two.
In the nex place, if you 're a trew born Harrystoorat you haven't
not no need not even to see so much as a wulgar Shop. The lord of
the Manners won't have no shops in this trewly grand place, excep
what's aoshally wanted for people's wants, and them few he's had
all stuck up close to the Railway Stayshun; so, exoep when you 're a
going away, you needn't even know as there is sitch a thing as a
Wulgar Shop in the hole Burrow, which must be a great blessin to
all the Hole-sailors and Re-tailors from London, who lives here, and
who must natrally hate the site of such low places.
My son WILLIAM, who is with me, is werry fond of boting, but as
of corse we can't eford to pay such prises as they askes here, he "a
made a werry nice erangement with the Ferrvman to let him row the
custummers backards and forrards all day long for nothing, and it
inkludes taking me over and back on the same kb'ral terms, and tho'
there aint quite so much wariety in it as some giddy youngsters
might want, we offen gits up quite a little egsitement when WILLIAM
runs slap into a houtngger or a rangdang.
I soon made acquamtence with a gentleman's gentleman, as I
formerly knowd at the "Albion," and over a frendly glass he told
me a good deal about the Swells as lives in the lordly Manshun
Houses as one sees on every side of him. He says as they 're that
partickler, that no one as keeps a earridge and pair would think of
condescending to speak to a pore devil as only kep a coach and one.
That no Hole-sailor from London ever so much as looks at a Re-
tailor, and a perfeshunal Gent cuts 'em both. And what they does,
their wives and families does too, and a great deal more, even down
to the little childun. Some of the princeple servants thort of carry-
ing it out a step-father among theirselves, but they wasn't quite such
fools as that cums to, and so you sees even a Butler assosheayting
quite familyear with a Footman, or even a Groom, if he's a good
emusin sort of feller.
They 've got a capital dodge here of letting out the botes by the
week or the munth at rejuoed prises, and why? Becoz they knows
werry well from long egsperience that the young Swells gos it at such
a pace when they fust oomes down, rowing from morning to nite,
that, after about 3 days, their pore hands is so covered with blisters
that they can't even look at a skull without a shudder. Old JOE says
it's quite lovely to see the pace as they goes at it for the fust few
days compared with the gentle paddle arterwards.
I had a good long look at the Dear in Booshy Park as I walked
through the railins and wonderd which nice bit of Wenson wood
fall to my share. ROBBBT.

Mr. Alderman and Baker! You can, if this is any crumb

conduct is unchristian, and you can say to them, as a
Baker, " Dough as you d be done by." Or you can make
light of your own discomfiture, and, d propos of its
having been Michaelmas Day when you were rejected,
Sou can say. pleasantly, that " the Geese have saved the
ity." Well, well; if to be a bachelor be your fault and
misfortune, Mr. Alderman HADLEY, may vpu speedily
become a qualified Benedick, — may you live till you
marry —and after. So farewell, Baker! As oven as we
think of thee, Baker, we will say, "May Oven bless
thee!"
ONWARDS! OR, A LITTLE FURTHER STILL.
(Projected S. E. R. Alterations and Arrangements for the ensuing Month.)
1. The lO'lO P.M. train from Charing Cross to Lewisham will, in
future, be 90 instead of, as usual, 55 minutes behind time at New
Cross.
2. An additional siding will be opened five miles from Edenbridge,
for the convenience of passengers by the 8'15 P.M. train to Canter-
bury, who will not be able to get there till 11*22 the next morning.
3. The up day Parliamentary from Dover will not proceed further
than Merstham Tunnel; but passengers getting out in the dark will
be allowed to grope their way out, and be taken as far back again as
Ashford in a coal-truck on paying the regular excess-fare.
4. The 8*17 train from Strood, the 7*9 from Hastings, the 8*18from
Chislehurst, the 9*15 from Paddock Wood, the 10'20 from Greenwich,
the 6'30 from Margate, the Continental Express, and the five local
suburban trams that have hitherto all arrived at Cannon Street
station together at 3'49 P.M. , will, on and after the first of next month,
be joined by the 7*15 and 9*52 from Croydon, the Hastings Mail, and
seven new supplementary fast trains, crossing them at intervals on
the up and down line. N.B.—Passengers by these trains going out of
their minds and jumping off the Company's viaduct into Southwark
Street, will be permitted to do so on snowing their certificates.
5. The third-class tickets of drunken dustmen, quarrelsome sweeps,
familiar card-sharpers, foul-mouthed costermongers, and raving
excursionists, will ne available at all the Company's Stations for a
journey in any first-class carriage, provided always not less than
fifteen^ endeavour to crush into a compartment already occupied by
six quiet and respectable first-class passengers.
6. The Company will not hold themselves responsible for the con-
dition of their rolling stock, and the attention of travellers is
specially directed to the new Bye-law, which enjoins that in the
event of the bottom of a carriage coming out, the occupants will not
be allowed to follow it on to the three-foot wav without paying
twice the amount of their original fares, plus the difference between
the point of their unexpected descent and their ultimate destination.
7. For the convenience of suburban passengers visiting the
theatres, a train of horse-boxes, fitted up with straw, will leave
Charing Cross at midnight, and be shunted, as circumstances require,
in the immediate neighbourhood of Spa Road or Blackheath.
8. Season ticket holders found strangling the Traffic Manager or
stray Directors unawares, without being able to furnish any suffi-
ciently satisfactory reason for their conduct will be prosecuted by
the Company's Solicitors.
9. The General Meeting of the Company will be held on the 5th of
November next, and as a very important resolution connected with the
carrying about of the Chairman in his own chair, with an evening
display of fireworks, will be proposed to the Shareholders, it is to be
hoped that they will attend in full numbers.
"SANITAS SANITATUM."
"The angel of death is, so to speak, hovering over a doomed land, and he
descends on those spots which are the foulest."—Sir Richard Temple's
Address at the Social Science Congreu,
THE Angel of Death, quoth Sir RICHARD, comes down
On spots that are foulest in every town;
Then flush out your sewers and clean all your drains,
And see that no refuse among you remains;
Be spruce as a school-boy made smart by pomatum,
And write on your shields " Sanitas sanitatum."
Remember that dirt, which too often one sees,
Is the herald of deadly zymotic disease,
That fever and dirt are convertible terms,
Since the one brings the other by fostering germs;
In your clean bill of health let there be no erratum,
And write at the top " Sanitas sanitatum."
When he wanders abroad, many a tourist has known
All the wonderful smells of the town of Cologne;
So take warning by that, and for ever decline
To be classed with that sewer-gassy place on the Rhine;
Let your cities be sweet, is the bard's ultimatum,
And stick to the text, Sanitas sanitatum."

Episode of the Pilot.
"THE piano's out of tune," says CHAYLEY, with his nose close to
the music, picking out the notes of "The Lost Chord" through his
eyeglass.
"Of course it is," retorts KILLICK, " with you thumping on it all
the morning."
In MELLEVILLE'S absence ashore I come in as peacemaker. I throw
oil on the troubled Musicians.
"Let's," I say, as suggesting something very slily, "let's get it
tuned."
"How?" asks CRAYLEY.
"By a tuner, of course," answers KILLICK, immediately adding,
"Tou don't think anyone was going to ask you to do it?"
CBAYLEY pretends to ignore KILLICK'S question, and, appealing to
Heaven by a slanting upwards glance through his eyeglass at the
cabin-skylight, he asks me—
"Is there a tuner on shore?"
"I should think so," I reply. I had for the moment forgotten
that we were at sea.
"Well, I'm not so sure of that," says KILLICK. ""We're in
Scotland, you know, and the national instrument is the Bagpipes."
"Well, Bagpipes are tuned," says CRAYLEY, superciliously.
"You don't know that," returns KILLICK. "You don't play them,
thank goodness! And if there is only a tuner for Bagpipes, he
won't be able to do the piano."
After some argument, we settle to go ashore and hunt up a tuner.
"Don't bother the Commodore about it." says KILLICK. "There's
a lot of trouble on the old man's mind "—(he is quoting a comic
song; his words and music perhaps!)—" this morning about the
necessity of having a Pilot."
This is new to me. I had associated Pilots only with "fearful
nights," with Bays of Biscay, with Arctic Expeditions, with ship-
wrecks, life-boats, and, in fact, with marine dangers of an aggravated
and alarming character generally.
It is news to CRAYLEY, too. KILLICK is master of the situation as
far as knowledge of the subject goes, and he avers, on the authority
of the Captain, and from having been in these waters before (so I
understand him to say), that a Pilot in the Hebrides is a necessity,
and without one we shall probably come to grief. By all means,
then, a Pilot.
MELLEVILLB has already gone ashore to secure one; so, as he is
fully occupied, we agree to start on a secret mission, say nothing to
anybody, and have the piano tuned in MELLEVILLE'S absence, so that
at night he will be both gratified and astonished.
On landing we flatten our noses against various shop-windows, and
hesitate on various door-steps, not being quite certain, in the absence
of any evidently musical establishment, where to go for what we want.
KILLICK suddenly calls to mind that when he was last here the
place to get a pianoforte-tuner was either at the Chemist's or at a toy-
shop. He is very nearly right. The Chemist directs us to the toy-shop.
'I here are dolls, carts, wooden soldiers, tin sailors, comic white
rabbits playing tambourines, baits for fishing, conj uring tricks, tackle,
walking - sticks, books, puzzles, stationery, magic-lanterns, and
nothing, except some toy musical instruments, such as drums,
trumpets, and musical glass boxes, to suggest that a pianoforte-
tuner is anywhere on the establishment, unless the man oehind the
counter is himself of that persuasion. But he doesn't look it. He
hasn't got a tuning face.
CBAYLEY undertakes to conduct the negotiation, on condition that
KILLICK doesn't interfere.
KILLICK confides to me his opinion that CHAYLEY is " sure to make
some muddle of it."
CRAYLEY commences the business he has in hand by inquiring the
price of fishing-tackle. From this by easy stages up to musical toys,
without buying anything, he is about to arrive at the inquiry as to

a pianoforte-tuner, when KILUCK, no longer to be repressed, cuts in
with the question point-blank. CRAYLEY, thus interrupted, stares at
him sideways, through his eyeglass, as if he had never seen him
before in all his life, and were resenting the impertinent interference
of an utter stranger.
The Proprietor of the Shop doesn't know where the tuner is at
present. As far as I can make out, he is either on a tuning voyage,
calling in at the different islands and tuning the pianos of the
inhabitants, or he is on the same errand inland, and is touring about
tuning everywhere, and restoring harmony generally. When ne will
be back there is no knowing. He is absent at present, and it may be
for years, or it may be for ever. There is not another pianoforte-
tuner to be found at this minute. There may be others, but the
Proprietor of the Shop, and, presumably, of the pianoforte-tuner, is
not aware of their existence. However, all that can be done, politely
intimates the Shopkeeper, shall be done, and if, in the meantime, we
can console ourselves with some newly-invented spinning-bait, or a
book of views of the country (where the pianoforte-tuner has gone),
or anything in the toy-line,—why, there is an almost inexhaust-
ible store at our disposal. We thank him, linger over a few toys,
inspect a brown horse on wheels dubiously, and gradually retire.
That Toyman will not bless us; but perhaps he will make up for our
want of enterprise in sticking it on to the Tuner's charge, should he
ever appear, which is of all probabilities the most improbable.
Further inquiry is useless. We give up the pianotorte-tuner, and
return to the ship.
Here we find MKLLEVILLE. He has Pilot on the brain; and he has
rather a headache in consequence. He is evidently much bothered
and anxious. The Captain seems a bit fidgety, bo we say nothing
about our search for a tuner, and, after sympathising with MELLE-
VILLE, we descend to our cabins.
There is a gloom over us. If the Pilot doesn't appear, we shall
remain here ever so long; if he does, we are off at once.
The Commodore has issued orders to this effect, and the Captain,
who is a man of few words, and always ready to make himself
agreeable and useful, cheerfully assents. The Captain, it appears,
is not personally acquainted with the Pilot who is to come aboard at
some time or other. MELLEVHLE has not seen him; he is takin g

THE ORIGIN OF GLOVES.

SIR,—Having read some letters in the -Papers about the origin of
gloves, and, not agreeing with any of the opinions therein expressed,
I send you a sketch of my idea on the subject.—Yours, FROU-FROU.

him on trust; and, as he tells us, in all his experience of yachting,
he has never yet had a Pilot on board.
I am reading Clarissa Harloiee, Vol. II. (latest edition), and
beginning to think that that smug old Mr. RICHARDSON, Author
and Tunbridge-Wells Shopkeeper, must have had exceptional views
on the best way of inculcating morality, when a noise attracts my
attention. A boat is alongside; and I catch the sound of MELLE-
VILLE'S voice welcoming some new arrival.
I tumble up the companion to see what is going on. The Commo-
dore is speaking to a respectably-dressed man of a rather nautical
appearance. He catches sight of my head, and beckons me to him.
'' Just pay the cab,—I mean the boat," he whispers to me; "it's
the Pilot. I 'm going to have a talk with him." And so saying, he
takes the nautical-looking person down the companion, showing him
every possible attention; for, as MELLEVILLE nas explained to us
all before, — and this is, now I come to think of it, what has
contributed to his nervousness and anxiety on the subject,—a Pilot
is a sort of Master of Arts, so to speak, of his craft. He is obliged
to pass an examination, he has taken his degree, and he holds a
rank which temporarily places him, when on board a ship delivered
over to his control, above Owner, Captain, Admiral, or anyone; and
of course, though paid by the week, and his fee, or honorarium, so
MELLEVILLE politely puts it, being exceptionally high, he has to be
treated as an Eminent Expert. Knowing that these are our Com-
modore's opinions as to the status of a Pilot, we all bow to his
decision, and are prepared to imitate our host's example.
First, then, I pay and dismiss the boatman who brought him.
The Boatman asks if he shan't wait ?" Certainly not!" I reply, as
I know that the Commodore's orders are to "sail at once, and
already the Captain has given the word, and the anchor—only one
out, and at no great depth—is being weighed.
It is all being done with a will, and as we are taut and trim, and
"ready, aye ready!" for sailing, literally at a moment's notice, it
will be less than half-an-hour before we are actually off. A nice
breeze is springing up, which will take us away; and the Pilot's
duties will not begin until we are well outside, and shaping our
course for Tobermpry. "We enter the cabin one after the other.
MELLEVILLE is talking with the nautical-looking man, and a decanter
of sherry and glasses are on the table.
We have no formal introductions from MELLEVILLE to the nautical
person, but the latter acknowledges each one of us with a sort of
polite inclination as we drop into the conversation in turn. The
introduction, of course, would be impossible, as MELLEVILLE doesn't
know the Pilot's name, and, as he is a person of " some consideration"
—(this is a bit Richardsonian, but a student of Clarissa Harlowe must
expect these words to crop up occasionally),—there may be a certain
etiquette to be observed of which introduction forms no part. We
have among us implicit confidence in MELLEVILLE, who, we suppose,
has mastered all these details, and we tacitly form ourselves into a
sort of committee of Lords of the Admiralty and Elder Trinity
Brethren, for examining the Pilot to ascertain whether he knows
more than we do, or, at all events, more than the Commodore does,
and whether, on the whole, he is to be trusted.
"A very nice boat indeed," the nautical person is saying, as we
enter. "Thankye, Sir, I will take another glass,"—and he does too,
a bumper, which he sips with the air of a connoisseur, instead of
drinking it off at a draught; as is popularly supposed to be the way
with the old sea-dogs. He is weather-beaten certainly, but he is not
by any means a sea-dog. He wears thickish serge, a waterproof
(which he has just removed), and a tall hat, which he has placed on
the table. The tall hat strikes me at once, as reminding me of the
old prints of sailors at the commencement of this century, and of the
queer old boatmen, Deal Pilots, for aught I know, who mav be seen
any day, with telescopes under their arms, on the beach at Deal.
I suppose," says MELLEVILLE. nervously, but in his pleasantest
manner, you know this coast—I mean all about here—by heart '<"
"Well, you see, Sir," replies the nautical individual, turning his
glass about and scrutinising the sherry, as if he had been tasting a
sample before purchasing a quantity,—" you see, Sir, I was born,
here, and I think I may say I know all this part—well—about as
thoroughly as anyone."
He speaks with a Scotch accent, rather narrow than broad.
MELLEVILLE looks round at us approvingly. His manner conveys
exactly what he would say, which evidently is this: "This is tne
very man for us, Gentlemen—he knows his way about. First-rate
fellow, this!"
I say to the Pilot diffidently, seeing that I know absolutely nothing
about it, and am not even quite clear as to our geographical position,
"Is this a very dangerous coast '<"
"In parts it is," replies our first-rate man—" in parts. At least,
it is to those who don t know it."
Obviously the inference is, that to those who do " know it" there
is not the slightest danger; and equally obvious is the next infer-
ence—that he is the man who does know.
Again MELLEVILLE turns to us, and smiles complacently.
"Is there good fishing about here?" asks KIUUCK.
We all feel that this is unfair on the Pilot. Why should he be
expected to know anything about fishing? He's not a fisherman.
However, it turns out that he is a fisherman, that he knows a good
deal about it. and can give his experience of several lochs. There is
a pause, and MELLEVILLE presses upon him another glass of sherry.
At this point we all join. I break through my otherwise invariable
rule of No sherry in order to do special honour to the occasion.
"A very fine wine this, Sir; very," says the Pilot, shaking his
head, and smacking his lips.
"Yes, it is," returns MELLEVILLE, and we all smack our lips more
or less, having suddenly given up our rules as Elder Trinity Brethren
and resolved ourselves into a tasting committee.
"Very fine!" repeats the Pilot, and again we all agree with him.
Then there is a pause. It is broken by the Pilot complimenting
MELLEVILLE on the yacht. "As handsome a vessel as he has ever
seen—and he's seen lots of 'em here," says the Pilot.
MELLEVILLE is highly pleased and gratified. We all take a little
more sherry, and at this moment the Merry Young Steward appears
with another bottle. Whether MELLEVILLE has summoned him or
not, I cannot say; probably none of us could say if asked. The
sherry is very good, and, having broken through my rule,—I believe
we have all, except CEATLET, whose rule is to do as he likes on all
occasions, broken through some rule on the subject of sherry,—I am
inclined to go on at all hazards.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
So we become communicative, and the conversation becomes
general. Somehow or another we get to talking about the Opera,—I
don't know who started it, but here we are, with our Pilot, talking of
the Opera and of Music generally, and still shaking our heads as
wisely as ever, and saying, "Yes, it is capital sherry."
"A very pretty instrument you 've got there, Sir," says the Pilot.
He is praising everything.
"Yes; it is," replies MELLEVILLE, and opens it. Is he going to
play the Pilot an air? No; he is only explaining its mechanism.
'You see it's a difficult thing to get this sort of piano," says
MELLEVILLE. "This is specially made for a yacht."
Yes, the Pilot is aware of that; he has seen them before: he can
tell MELLEVILLE of a better contrivance than this, of a new patent,
and perhaps a less expensive article.
"Very superior person, this Pilot!" we express by our looks to
one another. What an education he has had! Knows a little of
everything. More sherry. Fine wine, very.
The Pilot looks at his watch. Just as he does so there is an evident
lurch, and we all stagger a bit; it is very trifling, but there it was,
and we are evidently moving, but so easily that no effect till now
has been perceptible, and even now it is only very slight.
The Pilot appears to hesitate a minute, as if he wasn't exactly
certain what to do. The movement has entirely ceased, but from
the gentle ripple which strikes my ear, I am sure we are going
straight as an arrow before; the wind.
"I'd better get to work at once, Sir, if you please," says the Pilot,
again consulting his watch.
"But there's no necessity yet P" asks MKLLEVILLE, "is there 'f"
"Well, you see, Sir," says our superior nautical authority, "I 've
got a lot to do"
""Which, of course," puts in MELLEVILLE, in his politest manner,
"I don't understand. Would you like to see the Captain?"
The Pilot looks a little astonished, and replies, hesitatingly, "No,
Sir—I don't see any necessity—unless you"
"Oh no! Oh, certainly not," MELLVTLLE hastens to say, clearly
fearful of having committed some breach of etiquette.
"Of course he doesn't want to see the Captain," we whisper to
one another, and are rather surprised that a man of MELLEVILLE'S
tact and experience should have made the mistake.
MELLEVILLE appears a bit nervous. He coughs two or three times,
and then, drawing me on one side, he says, "I don't quite know
where he '11 sleep. I thought he would arrange with the Captain—
but—eh? Beg pardon. What?" This addressed suddenly to the
Pilot, who has been understood to ask for a key.
"Key?" repeats MELLEVILLE, puzzled.
"Key of the piano, Sir. I think you just locked it up."
"0 yes, I did-but"
Here we have another lurch, which brings the Pilot sharply up
against the farther corner of the piano, which he seizes desperately;
in fact, he would have fallen but for cannoning against CRAYLEY,
who, being of a slight and fragile build, staggers backwards on to
the sofa. A little sherry is spilt. Alone amongst us the swing-
table, with the sherry decanter and one glass on it, preserves its
equilibrium. It was apparently a sudden gust, for the effect has
passed, and we are going along steadily once more. An expression
of dismay is on our Pilot's face.
"Is the vessel sailing, Sir?" he asks, with a gasp.
"Well, you see," MELLEVILLE nervously explains, fearful of
having done something very wrong^-" well, I tola the Captain that
as your duties wouldn t commence till we g^ot outside"
"Outside!" exclaims the Pilot, convulsively.
We are afraid he is going to have a fit. An epileptic Pilot ought
not to be licensed. That is our one feeling on the suoject.
"Yes," continues MELLEVILLE. more and more nervous as the case
of the Lively occurs to him (he tells me this afterwards), "I thought
—that—your work would begin as we go up the Sound to Tober-
mory"
"Tobermory!" shouts the man. ." But I don't understand—why
should I go to Tobermory?"
"Because," replies MELLEVILLE. suddenly pulling himself together,
and, so to speak, dropping the Lamb to assume the Lion, "that
is where we nave arranged to go, and from there to Loch Scavaig,
and"
'Loch Scavaig !" the Pilot almost screams.
'Yes!" thunders the Commodore, now thoroughly roused. "You
said you knew all the coast, and as I only want a Pilot;"
'Pilot!" cries the man in a frenzy. "I 'm not a Pilot."
'Not a Pilot!" we all echo, in different tones.
'No!" he shrieks. "I've come to tune the Piano!"

"THE Boy stood on the burning deck." 0,1 've spouted it lots o'
times, so I know it.
(And I think he was a young mug for his pains, though made into a
hero by Missis HEMAXS the Poet),
But, bless you, his position, though about as
hot as they make "em, was rose-leaves and
strawberry-cream, for coolness and easiness,
Compared with the blessed look-out of the lot
of us, which is enough to till a feller with
fright and freeziness.
That Telegraph certainly has been raising
snakes, the fifth wheel of a coach, or con-
certinas among oysters are really not in it,
For superfluidness—no, I mean superfluity;

But the Tityrc tu business always did flummox me. Still, I've
studied SILAS WEGG and Mister TUPPEB, and other Bards,
And I mean coming out as the MINSTREL BOY, and to reel off my
poetical feet—by yards.
Where was I? Oh, "Our Boys "! Why, the Eastern Question, or
the double acrostics in the Taradiddler,
Are not a patch on us for right down puzzlement. If a feller's to be
brought up as a bricklayer or a tiddler,
Sent; into the City, or out to the Colonies, taught to wear KINO'S
tweeds, or corduroy or fustian,
Be sampled off as per individual quality, or evened heads and heels
on a bed Procrustean—
If that's the old bugaboo's name—is the question. But as to the
answer, blow me twice times never—
As they say in Aristophanes—if I can make that out from about fifty
columns, more or less, of controversial kibosh which the cocksure
kiboshers seem to consider clever.
(That last line appears to have run off its legs a little, like a centi-
pede in a hurry, but it doesn't much matter.)
I must say the impression produced on my mind is that the Grown-
ups are a mixed lot of Muddleheads and Miwies, for all their
cocknosiness and cockatoo clatter;
____ family ni ________ ...
Noodledoo, and are descendants of the SILLYASSES.
Perhaps this seems rude. Well, they're fond of calling me the
"Little Vulgar Boy" (vide Ingoldsby Legends),
But if you hit a whack with the hammer of plain English to drive
into obstinate wooden-heads a fact's thin wedge-ends,
You are certain to be called " Vulgar" by sophisticated old simfer-
noodles, whose minds are in a condition of chronic washiness,
And whose writings remind one of the Great Dismal Swamp, being
all tangle and gaudy flowers (of speech) on a substratum of
squashmess.
That's not all "my thunder," I don't mind telling you; I heard
some of it from my Guv'nor, who doesn't write to the papers,
And, if all Guv'nors had only as much quiet savvy as he nas, there
wouldn't be half the awful failures, nor a quarter of the peculiar
cflDcrs
"'Tisrft gumption goes howling," as we say at our School,— and for
grit and grind you won't easily beat St. Bumpus's;
And if dads weren't so often negbgent old duffers, and teachers tin-
pot shirks, and boys, in consequence, half-stuffed slip-slops,
there wouldn't be much occasion for these periodical rumpuses.
"Full inside!" may be the cry of the Army and the Navy, and the
Mercantile Marine, Law, Physic, Divinity, and the shop and the
office,
But " empty inside" ought to be ticketed on the nobs of lots of the
candidates for 'em, who have no particular idea of anything
except perhaps a general sort of notion of what a " masher" or a
"toft "is.

Timbuctoo as ostrich-hunter, notwithstanding the " pressure of
the multitude."
Quite rice versa, as Missis Gamp or that scrumptious writer, Mr.
ANSTEY, might put it; and I really believe that most of the
letters in the D. T. were penned in a fit of ink-spilling tantrums
by that pretty specimen of a " Paterfamilias," Mr. Bultitude.
Given good dads and decent lads, with their top storeys furnished
with something more than dates and dog Latin, knock on the
head the duffing old notion that a puer must be puerile (—look
at me for sixteen !— ), and I guess the round world is still large
enough to find most of us some decent " employ."
So no more at present — though I hope to take another turn at
Tupperising on an early occasion — from yours tremendously,
THE MINSTBEL BOY.

LA BELLE AMERICAINE;
OR, OUR FAIR EXCHANGE AT THE LYCEUM.
WE have real horses, real water, real everything on the stage, but
rarely do we see real acting. This exceptional treat may now be
enjoyed, in rather a small way it is true, at the Lyceum, which,
having given its HENRY IRVING to America, has taken in return Miss
MART ANDERSON. We had heard that Miss MABY ANDERSON was a
beautiful person. We went to see her performance of Parthenia in
Mrs. LOVELL'S Ingomar. Within a few minutes we were under the
spell, and had exclaimed, "She is more than fancy painted her;
she is lovely! she is divine!" and at that point, for reasons best
known to ourselves, but perfectly intelligible to our friends and
acquaintances, we cut short the quotation.
Miss MART ANDERSON'S Parthenia is charming. The American-
isms of speech must sound as defects in our Engush ears, and there
are certain stage-tricks and mannerisms not peculiar to Miss ANDER-
SON alone, but to every American Actress we have seen in this
country; and these tricks are copied, and, of course, absurdly
exaggerated by such English Actresses as have acquired whatever
art they possess in the States.
The tricks we especially note as "transatlantic" are: first, long
pauses, frequent and wearisome, and a drooping pf the eyelid, which
imparts a leeriness "—there is no other expression of it that we are
aware—to the glance quite out of keeping with any serious situation,
and utterly incompatible with the outward Eemblance of classic
dignity. It is in the graceful and pathetic portions of Ingomar
that Miss ANDERSON excels; but the note of tragedy does not

peculiar glance already alluded to as "leeriness" Parthenia, the
classic, the graceful, the chaste, the guileless Parthenia, has for
one second become a mere Palais-Royal ingenue, or a Criterion
Chambermaid. The transformation is startling. It is momen-
tary, but undoubtedly there it is. "We should much like to see her
as Miss Hardcastle in She Stoops to Conquer, with Mr. BARNES for
Tony Lumpkin. And, indeed, the second title of this very play,
Ingomar, might be She Stoops to Conquer. Ingomar himself is only
a superior sort of Lumpkin: spear and shield are to Ingomar what
hunting-crop. and spurs are to Antony Lumpkin, Esquire.
The part of Ingomar is a very difficult one to play, and the faults
of Mr. BARNES are those of the character itself exaggerated and
emphasised.
The play is delightful for a time, but not all the charm of Miss
ANDERSON'S Parthenia can prevent it from becoming tedious; so that
when, after a series of those long pauses, which belong, as it seems
to us, to the American School of Dramatic Art, Ingomar exclaims
roughly, "Go on!" the audience laugh at him, and with him, as if

his words were spontaneous "gag," and they heartily applaud this
expression of their own impatience. The play should have been
abridged, partially re-written, and its construction improved. It is
very well put on the stage: the costumes are effective. The beauty
of the scene at the rising of the curtain on the Second Act receives
distinct recognition at the hands of the audience.
Mr. J. G. TAYLOR, one of our very cleverest Actors, plays the old
villain, Polydor, admirably. We 'ye seen Mr. TAYLOR in Opera-
oouffe: he has a good voice, and is a fair musician; we "ve seen
him in a light comedy touch-and-go part, where he was immensely
funny j we've seen him in burlesque, and we've seen him as "t' owd
mon ' in Lowrie's Lass, and he is always excellent. His Polydor
is one of his best assumptions of character. For the rest, Mr.
STEPHENS, as the old Pantaloon of a father, who isn't worth Parthe-
nia's affection, and Mrs. ARTHUR STIRLING as her quarrelsome
old mother, were about as good as the piece made them, and no
better.
The fault of the play is undoubtedly the fact that the interest
centres on a doddering old idiot, Myron, who happens to be—(such

things will occur in real life)—the father of the beautiful, the wise,
and graceful Parthenia, who is, after all, only a second-rate artisan's
daughter. Who cares what becomes of such an old fool as
Myron, a dotard with so much water on the brain that the
"Alemanni "—never very "Gentlemanni" persons, or very con-
siderate at the best,—shout at him, "Cry, baby, cry! put your
finger in your eye!" which we admit is not so expressed in the dia-
logue, but which is certainly the idea? He is beneath contempt, and
yet everyone must feel that if Parthenia is so deeply attached to the
old armourer as to
risk her life for him,
there must be some-
thing very loveable
in him to those who
"know him at home." Per-
haps his being bullied by
Mrs. Myron has enlisted his
daughter's sympathy.
To sum up. In the First
and Second Acts Miss ANDER-
SON is as good as this Miss Par-
thenia can be; in the Third
she is not 'quite so'good; but
this "not quite" means such a
measurable distance as, were
it not for the sake of critical
truth, leaves small space for
cavilling. In the other Acts
she carries the piece along,
heavy as it begins to be, far
more easily than Mr. BARNES
bears in his stalwart arms the
fainting form of Parthenia.
We hear that Miss ANDERSON
is next to appear as Galatea
in Mr. GILBERT'S Pygmalion
and Galatea. This is a mis-
take. Galatea and Parthenia are both in classic drapery; and
perfectly suited as she will be as the "Statue Fair," it would go
with the public far better were she to allow an interval between two
classically-attired plays, during which she should play a modern
comedy, or appear in She Stoops to Conquer, as we have already
suggested.
But every theatre-goer, and those who are only irregular theatre-
goers, should not miss the present chance offered them of witnessing
Miss ANDERSON'S impersonation of Parthenia at the Lyceum.
A propos of things theatrical, we hear that The Glass of Fashion
is beginning to shine more brightly, and that the intelligent Public
is taking to it. Bar Act the First, the intelligent Public is right;
but, if Mr. GHUNDT'S play does not ultimately draw the Town,"—
the Author has drawn part of it, pretty strongly, too,—it will be his
own faxilt for having treated his subject seriously. Mr. SHINE is
capital in it, but we fear he will not make capital out of it. There
is much to amuse in the piece, but not enough.
Why this excitement about Mr. BANCROFT taking Mr. COGHLAN'S
part in Fedora, except for the sake of letting everyone know that,
after so many weeks allowed for refreshment, Fedora, with SARA-
BERNHARDT-BEERE & Co., had been revived at the Haymarket?
Mrs. BANCROFT is out of the bill. Ahem! Sharp this. What are
the odds that Mr. BANCROFT won't be out of it, too, very soon, or
return to his old part of Jean de Siriex, which fitted him like a glove
—that is, like a glove ought to fit. The report that he only appeared
as Loris Ipanoff because ne could not obtain the services of Mr. J. L.
TOOLE to replace Mr. COOHLAN as " Colonel of the Reserved Forces"
is, we believe, entirely without foundation.
"In the Ranks," the new piece at the Adelphi, will have got the
start of this article, and have come out before us. From the title,
we imagined that Mr. WARNER was playing the part of a Cabman, a
Handsome Cabman, of course; but this is not so.
Mr. HARRIS'S advertisement of his new Drury Lane Drama, which
is announced to appear "positively" on Thursday ("D.V."), is
worthy of the Augustan Age,—we avoid saying " '•'••""
ACT II.—" How he is carrying on with
her!" Miss Anderson supported by
the entire strength of the Company,

BEL-FAST AND FURIOUS !—A good finish to a dull week. Sir STAF-
FORD NORTHCOTE posing as an Orangeman! The Duke of ABERCORN
instituting a comparison between WILLIAM of Orange and the
"People's WILLIAM,"—in order to discredit the latter,—and the
Orangemen, Northcotians and Abereornians, practically illustrating
their enlightened Conservative Leaders' teaching with a torchlight
procession, when the Orange Boys bravely smashed the windows of
a house inhabited by inoffensive and blameless Sisters of Mercy, or
some religious order. Will the brave Baronet and the dougnty
Duke disavow their friends, as M. GHEVY did the cowardly Parisian
mob, and speak of them as " les miserable! " f

has written to the LORD MAYOR

cient hospitality of the City

SUNDAYS OUT OF SESSION.
WHAT further joys has the Recess in store, not only for the mem-
bers of Her Majesty's Government, but possibly for the leaders of
the Opposition? Here is a paragraph from the Times of Oct. 1st:—
"THE PREMIER. — Yesterday, despite a cold, biting North wind, and
threatening clouds, Haworden Church was crowded with visitors from all
parts to listen to the PREMIER reading the lessons for the day."
Noting by the way, that if this sort of " great attraction" must be
advertised, and the result reported, in future on Sundays the work-
a-day title of "Premier" had better be dropped, and that of
"Minister" be used, perhaps the best lesson the Prime " Minister"
could read to the inquisitive crowd who flock to hear him, would be,
—not to read any lessons at all.
Meantime, as the public will be on the look out for paragraphs
relating to this new sort of political Sunday observance, here are a
few taken at random:—
"Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT yesterday appeared in his parish church in his
new Beadle's uniform. Though the cape seemed a little tight, yet the
interest created by the worthy Baronet's appearance was so great that there
was scarcely a vacant pew in the whole church, a fact that the organist hap-
pily chronicled by playing the congregation out with a Gregorian rendering
of 'Non Pew Mot a.'''
"Sir STAFFORD NORTHCOTE attended the Cathedral service yesterday
afternoon as usual in his Verger's dress, the Anthem being, curiously enough,
'In Vergtr Clad.'"
"The rumour that Lord SALISBURY, who had been practising the manage-
ment of the Stops throughout the Session, would take his place at the organ
in the village choir on Sunday lost, filled the little church to overflowing.
Additional interest was excited on the occasion by a rumour that the Noble
Marquis had expressed his determination to act as his own blower."
It will be seen from the above how rapidly the custom may be
expected to develope; and, therefore, if we hear next week that the
PREMIER, after his customary feats in the Hawarden woods, has on
Sunday again drawn a large crowd together by reading a chapter of
the Axe, there will be no occasion for any surprise.
A DISCLAIMER.
IT is scarcely necessary, yet as some kind friends might possibly
avail themselves of the opportunity to insinuate something pleasant
in the most amiable and narmless manner, of course, we just men-
tion the subject, "without prejudice," as Mr, Guppy would say,
and dismiss it.
In the Times' Law Report, date October 4, there appeared, among
the cases heard in the Court of Bankruptcy, this one, the heading of
which naturally attracted our attention :—
"IN HE JAMES PUNCH AND SON.—A petition for liquidation has been
filed by Messrs. LINKLATEU, solicitors, on behalf of Messrs. J. W. AND C.
PUNCH, merchants, carrying on business in Wormwood Street, City, under
the firm of JAMES PUNCH AND SON."
Mr. Punch wishes it to be stated that no connection exists between
himself and the members of this firm, with whom in their misfortune
he expresses his sincere sympathy. Mr, Punch wishes it to be
known that he never carried on any business in " Wormwood Street,"
which is not in his line. As to his own distinguished lineage, it is
the most ancient in the world. It is older than Judy-ism. There
are branches of the family abroad, but in England the Head of the
House does not acknowledge even "the Suffolk Punches."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAEI.

THE BEAN HARVEST.
Cockney Tourist. "Tux-T-T! GOOD GRACIOUS! WHAT EVER CAN 'AVE MADE THE CORN TURN so BLACK?"
RABELAIS REFORMED.
ANOTHER Volume of the interesting and useful More-and-Morley
Series published by ROUTLEDGE has just appeared. We were curious
to see what Professor MOHLEY would make of RABELAIS. It was an
Augean-stable task this of purifying the Rabelaisian muck-writing
so as to render it in any way fit for ears or eyes polite. To make it
suitable for the "Young Person," so that it might appear on the
shelves of the Podsnap Library and find a place on the Podsnapian
drawing-room table under the very eyes and nose of the " Young
Person, was too much to expect: in fact, had it been Bowdlerised
to this extent, nothing of the real Rabelais could have been left,—
and to our thinking so much the better. Mr. MORLEY has taken an
infinity of trouble, and has succeeded in what he set himself to
do. But was it worth doing at all? For ourselves we should say,
decidedly not. For what was RABELAIS with all his works? A
dirty-minded, scurrilous, blasphemous, witty, broadly humorous,
and extravagantly grotesque clerical buffoon.
Take the scholarly Father PROUT, Dean SWIFT, and the Rev.
LAFBKNCE STERNE at their very worst, throw in the rollicking spirit
of the Rev. THOMAS BABHAM, with a spice of the wit of that
"eminent ascetic," SYDNEY SMITH, flavour it strongly with the gross
licence of the "Table Talk" of the Rev. Dr. MAETIN LUTHER, add
the profligacy of BOCCACCIO, and you then have something akin to
the literary monstrosity called RABELAIS. How many of those who
use the term "Rabelaisian wit" have read even a few chapters of
his works? Not that they could possibly be any better for the
perusal. It needs not a Pharisaical Purist to be disgusted with
RABELAIS, in the original, within the first hour's reading.
Professor MORLEY flatters himself on having so dealt with the dirty
old blackguard that, "having wiped his shoes at the door," he can
enter " to us all and speak in his own person." No, thank you. Not
at home to the Rev. Mr. RABELAIS. "Ladies present," and not,
though his reformation were guaranteed by Professor Bmcdler and
Podsnap themselves, would we admit him—no, not so much as a toe
of him into our family circle. Virginibus mterisque—never!
"Wiped his shoes," indeed! Yes, Canon RABELAIS may have wiped
them dry too, but as he has been up to his eyes in filth, merely
"wiping his shoes" won't do. On whose mat? Send for quarts
of CONDY'S fluid. "And smells so! Pah!" "Wash him,* said
Mr. Dick. Strip him, warm-bath him, soap-and-water him, scrub
him, till he yells again, like the "dirty boy" in the well-known
statuette—(Professor MORLEY cleansing RABELAIS should be a com-
panion work of Art)—burn his odoriferous clothes—eau-de-Colognise
him—but no matter what be the process, not all the perfumes of
Arabia can make RABELAIS sweet and clean and wholesome. Let
his works remain on the shelf, a very high shelf, which will be in
every sense appropriate, in a Rabelaisian Museum dedicated to that
purpose, isolated from civilisation—accessible only to professional
litterateurs and students. And where shall this place be r Where?
The Island of Muck, N.B.
WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH OUR BOYS?
Tms momentous question, which was first asked in the columns of
the Daily Telegraph, seems likely to be satisfactorily answered in
the following that nas recently appeared in the advertisement sheet of
the same journal :—
CLERK and COLLECTOR (22 to 25).—A Gentleman, through
indifferent health often absent from business, sometimes travelling,
requires a well-educated resident Clerk who would be efficient in business,
obliging, and companionable out of it. Light duties, with a comfortable
home for one fond of book, garden, or a quiet pipe.—Address, &c.
This rash advertiser is probably by this time up to his eyes in
letters concerning the above appointment, and his street is possibly
blocked by a crowd of applicants for the post. The hint that the
master is "often absent from business," the suggestion of ''book,
garden, or quiet pipe," is undoubtedly attractive. Depend upon it,
this situation would suit most of " Our Boys " down to the ground.
A PROPOS of the Church Congress, Mrs. RAMSBOTHAU said she
regretted that they didn't discuss the use of the Athenscum Creed, to
which the excellent old lady is not absolutely certain whether she
objects or not.

THE CITY MISTRY SOLVED.
WELL, I thinks as even the henemys of the Corporashun, if they
has any left, must confess as they has been a-givin the Public quite
a seerys of staggerers lately.
BROWN savs, as the Public allers wants wakin up in the silly
season, and they 'ye just gone and woked 'em up accordinly. Fust
they comes out with such a Weddin as so astonished the Archbishop
of LONDON as quite to take away his appetight at Breakfast, as I
much regretted to see. Ah, that was sumthink like a weddin that
was! It s really quite surprising how the old Corporashun manages to
make things as is quite ordinerry ocashuns elsewhere, quite wunders
of hart and hellegance and granjcr where they are concerned. It 'a
pretty ginerally allowed that to be Lord Mayor of London is enuff to
satisfy the hambition of the ighest or the aughtiest, but the world
hardly knowd what it was to be one of his Dorters. For 120 long
ears, as I herd his Reverence the Archbishop say, there has been only
three Weddins in Sum Porl's Katheedle, and two on "em has been
with Lord Mare's Dorters.
Princes has asked for the favor, Dukes has tried their best, and
Markisses and Lords and Barrens by the duzzen has gone down on
their nees to the Archbishops of London for this glorious privilidge,
but no! they has allers said no! we draws the line at Lord Mare's
Dorters, except just once for the Dean's, and we means to keep to
it. So that's pretty well to begin with for the young lady.
Then only jest about 3,000 people cums for to see her married, and
I don't call that bad, then jest about 250 of the gratest, because the
richest swells in the hole City of London cums to brekfast with her
young Ladyship, and all on em sends such lovely presents to make
her future happy as makes my old eyes twinkle ony just to peep at
now and then, and that I should think is not quite a everyday
suckemstance. And then just think of this, the Dean and his
many Chapters havin hung up a reglar peel of Bells, they keeps
'em harf quiet till a Lord Mare's Dorter's marrid before thev
sets to work and rings out for the fust time a splendid Tribble Bob
Major. And then, as a sort of wind-up, just about harf a thouseud
quit fresh peeplet all in weddin garments, cums in late, just to
keep the game alive, as it were, and they stays and they dances
and thev sups 'till about three o'Clock in the mornin.
So I think if I had my choice of what I 'd like to be, if I was vun<*
and lovely, witch I settinly ain't, I 'd chewso to be a Lord Mare's
Dorter.
But who that seed all that splender and all that bewty and all
that rewelry, would have thort what momonjious consikenses wold
arise in less than -18 ours from all that ere!
Ah it's a rum world, and werry few on us nose, not even an Ned
"Waiter, what may be the efiec of the britest of scenes or the
merryest of Tribble Bob Majors! But to proceed with my task.
Friday passes away quietly as if nuffen partickler had happened
yesterday or was about to happen to-morrow, and then Micklemass
Day arrives, a day, as that rude BBOWN remarked, sacred to Geese
and Lord Mares, and the members of the warious Livry Companies
assembles in their thousands in Oildhall to chewse two Lord Mares
for 'nex year, and*the".Washupfool Aldermen assembles in their
skarlit robes to chewse the one on 'em as they thinks is the best for
that grandest of all pcrsitions. And the Liverymen chewses Order-
man HADLY and Orderman FOWLER, and then the Ordermen in their
skarlit robes retires to their golden chamber where all the little light
as there is has to come in threw painted winders for fear it should
blind 'em, and then they sollemlv lox the dore and plases their own
Fceld Marshall outside with his drawn sword for fear any one should
lissen at the werry big key ole, and then they discusses the Candid
dates and then they wotes! Yes, and then they wotes! Wot a wote
was that, my gallant Liverymen!
Then they all goes back to the place from whence they came, as
the Judge says on ekally sollem ocashuns, and then the Recorder,
pale with emoshun, enounces as the wote has fallen on Orderman
FOWLER.
Ever since that ewentful enoxmcement the one question as all
the world has bin a askin everybody else is, why did the Ordermen
prefer the Junior who 's the oldest, to the Senior who 's the youngest?
Ah, that 's rayther a diffycult nut to crack with only 6 teeth in your
hed, and them all top uns! But as I haven't bin a City Waiter for 20
year without yearing a good deal; for people will talk as if I was def ,
which I ain't, praps I can sattisfy the unywersal cureosity a good
deal betterer than most people.
Well then it wasn't for none of the raisons as people as said, nor
as the press as said, for they was all as sillv as they was ill-natured,
but it all arose out of the magniflscent Weddin of Thuresday at
Sum Porls Katheedle! It was thort, and I thinks werry naterally,
that if one Lord Mare's Dorter's marrage could cause such a
scnsashun, it was desirable to, as it were, (to use a wnlgerism) keep
the pot a bilin, and it was resolved that the prize should go where
the chances was most f averabil. I need only hadd that while Order-
man HADI.Y is meerly a Batcheldore, Orderman FOWLEE is the appy
Father of nine fare dorters.
Need I say more ? _ ROBERT.
IN this month's Number of the Nineteenth Century Review, the
Rev. G. R. GLEIO;, late Chaplain-General of the Forces, writes on
the subject of "Short Service — One Cause of its Failure." As a
Clergyman he ought to know, of course. But if his short services
have been a failure, it must be because they 've not been short
enough. Cut the sermon.
Bishop of CARLISLE talked about the "fundamental antithesis
between Faith and Science," and added, subsequently, " Faith, too,
is to a certain extent founded on knowledge. From which it is
evident that, "to a certain extent" also, the Bishop of CARLISLE has
as much faith as knowledge — which is about what CARLYLE would
have said to this Bishop.
MRS. RAMSBOTH.VM says that when she goes to Paris she likes to
hear a grand service on Sunday, and so she always goes to the
Church of St. Surplice; a name which she considers most appro-
priate.

D. Tea.
A SUNDAY MORNING AT HAWARDEN.
SCEUTE—Breakfast-Room. PRIME MINISTEH discovered alone.
Mr. Gladstone (soliloquising}. It is the peaceful, the unbroken
calm of this rural retreat which is so truly refreshing. How
pleasant it is to know that the simple villagers are now wending their
way churchwards, to the sound of yon tinkling bell, far from the
turmoil of cities, the din (Yells, whistles, catcalls, and hurrahs
here render the PREMIER'S words quite- inaudible, eren to himself.
He pauses.) But surely I heard some slight, some hardly perceptible
sound? Ah, here comes HERBERT; perhaps he (for he knows every-
thing) will explain the phenomenon.
Mr. Herbert Gladstone (appearing suddenly). I have been gazing
through the telescope on the Northern battlement. The trains from
Plymouth, Portsmouth, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and the Isle of Wight
are discharging hundreds of passengers at the Station. The Liver-
pool special is waiting in a siding, and twenty-seven of the omnibuses
from Chester have drawn up at the village inn. Quite five thousand
highly respectable excursionists, with hymn-books and top-hats, may
be observed thronging the road to the Church, while an equal
number are waiting at the Park Gates, to see you come out.
The Premier. Really, this indicates a great increase of intelligent
curiosity among the masses. I am glad to know that the Board
Schools are at work in the country. Then STEPHEN expects a large
congregation this morning?
Mr. H. Gladstone. Oh, yes. He tells me that the number of
people who brought blankets, and camped out in the churchyard last
night was surprising. He is thinking of requesting them to get rid
of their sandwich-papers and ginger-beer bottles in some other
receptacle than the Church Porch.
Mr. Gladstone. Ah, I noticed that STEPHEN did not appear to be
very pleased when I expressed to him my intention of reading the
Lessons for him for the rest of the year. He said he was afraid I
should catch cold, and offered to give me a little service of my own
in the Castle. Now, shall we set out to Church?
Mr. H. Gladstone (gloomily). I fancy it would be better to stay
indoors to-day. The Verger says (through the special telephone wire
which we have had connected with his residence) that every seat is
full, and that several leading Liverpool Merchants have taken up
their positions in the Font. The Chief Constable of Flintshire and a
posse of Policemen have just cleared a sort of way up the" middle
aisle.
Mr. Gladstone (surprised). Dear me! I have informed STEPHEN
that the regard for the services of the Church shown by his crowded
congregations ought to be most gratifying to him, and he says it
would be, if the congregation stayed to hear him preach, and did not
troop out after the second lesson. This is a one-sided view to take,
of course; but I fancy this innovation of his, in putting the Lessons
after the sermon, may lead to some rioting, perhaps even to bloodshed.
Mr. H. Gladstone. Yes. The Verger has received several threaten-
ing letters, and strong language has been used on the subject by a
few hundred excursionists from London.
Mr. Gladstone. Ah, poor fellows! Well, it must be provoking to
come all that way in the pursuit of a well-directed curiosity, a thirst
for information, and (Uproar in the Park. Stones and hymn-
books hurled through windows.) What does this mean?
Mr. If. Gladstone. I will go and interview them. (After a brief
absence.) The mob. it seems, have purchased return tickets to
Hawarden, which include a visit to the Church, and reading of
Lessons by the PRIME MINISTER." They remark, and I must observe
with some force (as one of their missiles has nearly broken my head),
that "they can't get into the Church, and there ain't no PRIME
MINISTER, and thev don't intend to be cheated out of their money."
The Premier. What, then, had I better do? I can, of course,
escape by the postern, or even ascend one of the few trees which
have not felt mv axe, and hide amid the foliage.

POT AND KETTLE.
(A Acic Version.)

[The Dean of Bangor says, that if he had his own way there would be
much less tea-drinking among people of all classes. Excessive tea-drinking
created a generation of nervous, discontented people, who were for ever com-
plaining of the existing order of the Universe, scolding their neighbours,
and signing after the impossible. In fact, he suspected that over-much tea-
drinking, by destroying the calmness of the nerves, was acting aa a dangerous
revolutionary force among us. The tea-kettle went before the gin-bottle,
and the physical and nervous weakness thnt had its origin in the bad cookery
of an ignorant wife, ended in ruin, intemperance, and disease.]

THE PROGRESS OF RATIONALISM.
DEAK MB. PUTTCH,
THE "rationalising tendency of the age" (how often have I
heard my dear Papa, who is a clergyman, make use of the phrase !),
not content with criticising the Vestments of the Clergy, actually
threatens to interfere with the vesture of Ladies! I suspect that all
the twaddlers about "Rational Dress." or horrid Positivites or
dreadful Diagnostics—are those the words ?—or something shocking
in that way. Rubbish! Reason has no more to do with dress than
with religion. That stands to reason. Reason, indeed, as far as I
can make out, is a sort of Big Bogey that men make use of when
they want to scare us out of all that is pious and pretty, and proper
and pleasant, such as High Church ritual, and twelve-button gloves,
and flirting, and fashionable novels, and tight-la—I mean corsets,
and five o'clock tea, and small talk, and curate-culture, and high-
heels, and—oh! everything that is nice, and, in their crabbed opinion,
therefore obnoxious. But if Dress could be rationalised (it can't be,
thank goodness !) there would be nothing left to live for. Dress and
true religion are, I maintain, above argument, matters entirely of
conscience and taste, and if Reason is to be introduced into them, we
may as well all turn Dissenters and Dowdies at once.
Yours indignantly.
ANOELDTA.
Rational Dress, indeed! They might just talk of Rational Love.'
No, let Reason keep to its own province, such as making laws, and
locomotives, and treaties and things, letting alone the really
important things of life, such as Marriage and Millinery, icith ichicn
it can hare absolutely nothing to do!
WHY is Lord LANSDOWNE likely to be unhappy ?—Because he has

[OCTOBER 20, 1883.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE BROKER BROKE OF BULLION, COURT
THEATRE, AND THE FAITHFUL ARIEL.
MH. G. W. GODFREY'S Mittionnaire is a very amusing, and, on the
whole, fairly interesting piece, if any interest can be got up for such
a limp heroine as Miss MARION TERKT'S Katharine Gut/on. But the
great merit of the piece, and the secret of its success, is the balance
of character which, with a few trifling exceptions, is admirably pre-
served throughout. The play, therefore, is symmetrical, and both
Author and Actors seem to have wisely agreed together that " a part
is not greater than the whole." Would that this axiom were every-
where remembered and acted upon!
The ''character-part" of Mr. Gut/on belongs to that family of selfish
unprincipled old reprobates of whom Brigard in Frou-frou,—Mr.
CECIL occasionally reminds us of
RAVEL in this rule—Dutrecy in
Moi, Le Pere Prodigue, Major
Pendennis with his "begad,"
CHARLES MATHEWS'S My Awful
Dad, Sir Harcourt Courtly,
IRVING'S Digby Grand, and Mr.
Bray in Nicholas Nickleby. are
the most distinguished members.
There is nothing new or striking
in any of the situations in which
this rather conventional type of a
mixed character finds himself,
but in Mr. CECIL'S hands it is
a highly-finished, though some-
what overeoloured, portrait.
Another equally good indica-
tion of character is given by Mr.
SroDEls* as Gordon Frere. In
Mr. Arthur Cecil, as Here 's-another- fact, the best played scene between
Guy-on, receives £200, and goes off any two characters sustaining the
to see Ariel at the Gaiety. serious interest of the plot, is the
first in the piece between the
goody-goody Money-Broker, Robert Streightley (Mr. CLAYTON), and
the careless needy young-man-about-town, Gordon Frere; the only
blot upon it being, that, where all the other dialogue is so naturally
written and so naturally given, the Author has thought fit to put
into young Gordon Frere s mouth a long speech for the sake of
securing an effective exit (was it at the Actor's suggestion?), in
which object, however, it signally fails. The effective exit would
have been for him to have left the sermonising to the goody-goody
Broker, and to have made some curt remark which would have given
his Goody-Goodiness just so much of his mind as a young fellow
like Gordon Frere could spare without serious inconvenience.
Never has Mrs. WOOD been seen to greater advantage than as
Lady Henmarsh. Her lines have fallen in pleasant places, and
everyone of them she points with unerring aim. The character
might soon have been overpowering, and the slightest exaggeration,
even now, would be dangerous. It is specially here that tie well-
kept balance is noticeable. May the well-kept balance be the
Author's suitable reward at his banker's.
Miss LINDLEY, as Mrs. Cholmondeky-Browne, lends excellent aid
in completing the picture, though the rehearsal of the amateur thea-
tricals is about as dull as the reality, and the desire of the eminent
amateur, Tippy Trafford, represented by Mr. GILBERT TRENT, to
sing a comic song on every possible occasion, is another of the very
trifling mistakes which the Author has made, and which, were it not
for the general excellence, it would be hypercritical to notice.
Mrs. BEERBOHM TREE'S rendering of the detestable Hester Gould
is masterly, or, more truly, "missisly." It lacks force; but this is
Mrs. TREE'S first appearance, we believe, on any stage, and when we
remember what a prodigious fuss was made about the first appear-
ance of a mere amateur because she was a " professional beauty,"
and what foolish laudations were showered on her before she had
scarcely acquired the merest elements of stage-playing, we can only
say that those who found a Mrs. NESBITT in the novice to whom we
have just alluded, would have discovered a Mrs. SIDDONS, a RACHEL,
or a RISTORI, or perhaps the talent or genius of all three combined,
in Mrs. BEERBOHM TEEE. Certainly, as the honours of full comedy
are borne off by Mrs. WOOD, so those of limited tragedy, in this
piece, are carried off by Mrs. TEEE. She and her husband are a pair
of pop'lar Trees.
Mr. MACKINTOSH, as Thacker, leads the audience astray. He
can't help it; he has followed the Author. The Israelitish usurer,
who, for the consideration of eighty per cent., trades on family name
arid honour—such, at least, is Mr. Thacker represented to be, as
opposed to Mr. Streightley, the high-principled Money-Broker, not
Money-Lender—is made up so as to be a mixture of a Moses and a
Mephistopheles, and suddenly in the Third Act he becomes the good
angel of the drama, unites husband and wife, and is so much, in
fact, the peace-maker that we should be inclined to re-christen—no,

re-name^him "Make-peace Thacker, eh?" but for the sacrilege
of associating so revered a name with the personality of a miserable
eighty-pershenter.
The Broken Broker is uninteresting. It is not a strong part for a
strong man. He is a contemptible creature ; worse, on account of the
variance between his excellent principles and his treacherous prac-
tice, than is Guyon himself, or Thacker. For acting, the first scene
is his best. With the laudable object of avoiding conventionality at
the end of each Act, the Author, in consequence of the effort having
been half - hearted,
and clearly not
warmly seconded by
the company, has left
these final tableaux
ragged and ineffec-
tive,—each is an end
without any finish.
The French comedy-
writers do this as a
rule, and their Actors
understand it tho-
roughly. Ours don't,
and the question is,
which is right? But
in any case indecision
is dangerous. Instead
of that Polytechnic

Ariel was produced at the Gaiety last week, and was received with
demonstrations of rapturous delight—and electric light—by a house
crowded in'.every part. At the end of the Second Act, after the
Curtain hadibeen hauled up three times to show the strikingly beau-
tiful tableau .of Miranda (Miss GILCHRIST) saving Ferdinand (Miss
BEOUGJITON) from the waves, while "Ariel (Miss FAEEEN), with elec-
tric-lighted wings, dances

audience insisted upon the
Author coming before the
Curtain to receive their
vociferous congratulations,
and his appearance was the
signal for such cheering as
must have sent up the Elec-
tric Light shares to an enor-
mous premium. It was,
judging from the wings,—
Ariel's wings we mean,—
literallva "brilliant" suc-
cess. The next day, and for
a week afterwards, the
critics outdid themselves:
and to those who could read
between the lines, they did
not seem to have enough
to say in laudation of this
triumphant Shakspearian
burlesque-fairy-drama, or,
to put it shortly, extrava-
ganza.

scarcely finding any difference between the Ariel of SHAKSPEARE'S
creation and that of the burlesque-writer's travesty. In fact, the
praise was so lavishly bestowed that we began to ask, How on
earth has the author managed to "get at" or nobble" the incor-
ruptible critics? Has the humorist humoured them P Had he pre-
viously taken them, individually and separately, into his confidence,
and, as a great favour, let each one after dinner read a few gems
of the libretto, and induced the Composer, Herr MEYER Lurz, to
drop in and give them some choice specimens on the piano? Was it
a case of Dr. MOWBRAY MORRIS'S " chicken and champagne" treat-
ment for acute criticism? However it was managed, there is no
doubt as to the result; and if criticism such as this could alone make

a piece, then nothing further was wanting to ensure the success
of Ariel. The music of Ariel, when not by the Composer^ above
mentioned, is taken from the works of VON SUPPE, LEO I>i' 1.1 i:i>,
THOMAS, and WAONEB, and the music-hall element is represented
by a couple of tunes, the pick of that peculiar repertoire.
- Mr. ELTON'S Caliban is a most artistic performance, and the dance
between him and Miranda is worthy of the unanimous treble encore
it receives, as
every step is full
of meaning, is in
perfect keeping
with the situa-
tion, and is as
pointed as their
own toes.
We agreejwith
the enthusiastic
critic in the
Daily Tele-
graph, though
we could not
venture to ex-
press our senti-
ments with such
absolute convic-
tion, as to Miss
FABBEN'S repre-
sentation of the
character of
Ariel. "She
might." he says,
"as well be Puck, or, Will o' the Wisp,"—ol course she might,
just as well, for, as this writer hints, she could not be better.
Every song of hers tells, and in the last Act her "La Eou-
lonaise" is demanded two and three times. Well might the critics
be at a loss for words to express their feelings on the first night,
but on the third, when the excitement had fizzled off, and the
company had settled down steadily to their work, the representatives
of the Press, had they been there, would have had lumps of delight
in their throats, wept in each other's arms, and have been carried out
in ecstasies. Objecting to " gush" as we do, we could yet wish that,
in the interests of true criticism, the critics' night were everywhere
postponed until the third performance of any new piece. Vive
SHAKSPEABE!
If Mr. IRVING, or any Shakspearian Revivalist, were to produce
SHAXSPEABE'S Tempest intact, a more charming set of Fairies—of
course, essential to the piece, whether SHAXSPEABE'S original, or
DHYDEN'S, or MACBEADY'S version, be played,—could not be seen, or
heard, than those at the Gaiety, of whom the two " Singing Witches,"
Misses PEELEY and TATLOB, are the leading spirits. It is an excep-
tional thing for choruses to be encored, but the rendering of MEYEB
LDTZ'S clever imitation of the Rataplan solo and chorus in Les
Huguenots thoroughly deserves it. And now we've done with
theatricals for some time, as we can't get to see Mr. HABBIS'S Dyna-
mite Plot at Drury Lane for at least another fortnight.

How I loathe all this vulgar notoriety! But, there, thank good-
ness, the tour is over!
Delightful to think I shall have a little quiet and breathing-time
before I start! Yes, as I told them at Liverpool, I think there is far
too much "fuss" made about us,—that is, about me. Yes, I am
almost sure there is. But they will do it. Why, I positively feel
<juite fagged at times with after-dinner spouting. And I 'm always
telling them the same thing, too,—that I wish I had been born, or
bred, or buried, or something in their own blessed particular town.
What humbug! But what is one to say'? That reminds me.
Delightful social little gathering in prospect for to-night—just a few
choice intimates, to eat a farewell chop with me at the Club! Some-
thing like privacy, that. I 'm quite looking forward to it. Welcome
honest Sociability, at last!

About forty, or so, at that little affair last night. Odd! Came
off, too, in the "Strangers'" room. However, I knew 'em all—and
that s something. I see. notwithstanding the precautions, it has got
into the papers. Odd that, too! They don't seem to have reported
my speech, though. Can't find it anywhere. Still, happy idea that,

Travelling all day. Departure seems to have been well billed.
Am told that the booking at the ticket-office was tremendous.
Bouquets for Miss T at every Station, and a splendid clothes-
basket of fresh vegetables offered me by the Mayor of X !Told
him if it wasn't that I had paid my fare, I would get put, and end
my days at the place. People lining the way both sides through
seven counties. Never seen anything like it since first night of
Much Ado About Nothing. Quite done up with dashing across the
carriage every half-minute to bow to them. Neck got so stiff, I
couldirt smile. If this goes on, I shall make LOVEDAT get himself
up as nearly as he can like me, and do the acknowledgment business,
while I have a nap at full length on the floor under the seat!

Knowsley! His Lordship most affable. Also my "grand old
rival," as he called himself. Compared notes. Says he finds the
cheering loudest when they can't see much of him—just a bit of shirt-
collar and an eye. His recipe for comfort, however, is " never show
at the window—but when you get a chance come out on to the plat-
form and speak—till you clear it." Mem. Shall try this some day
at Clapham Junction. Wishing to be polite was doing a bit of
Dazzle to him in a corner, when he cut me short by reading a full
abstract of his forthcoming speech on "Nationalisation of the Land."
Half through it when I found I had to catch a train. Hearty
apologies to nis Lordship. Told him I felt alreadv as if I had lived
at Knowsley all my life, and that when I come oack I hope to be
buried there. We parted smiling. A pleasant morning.
******
Much disappointed (of course, merely by contrast) at my reception
at W. A local Bishop, a Town Council, and a trumpery arch or two
with " Welcome HENBY," and a mob held in check by simple mounted
constabulary. Well, that sort of thing won't do after Knowsley!
Perhaps they took me for BEAM STOXEB? Who knows? However,
I did the civil thing; said I hoped to come back and be buried with
them, and moved off amidst enthusiastic cheering, bowing coldly.
Ha! the landing-stage at length. Crowd quite dangerously large
—very flattering this :—very, but I hope they won't let all of them
on to the tender! Still I appear to be surrounded by friends. A sea
of faces: old faces ;—new faces—a great many new faces. Yet I
seem to know all of them. Shall say so. I wonder whether that
distinguished personage in tears, in a cocked hat, waving a farewell
with a gold-tipped mace, is the LOBD MAYOB about to offer me the
freedom of the City. Better be civil. Tell him I feel as if I had
known him all my life. He says he is the Pier Beadle, and that
unless I want to go to America by mistake, the sooner I make for
the shore the better.
• *•***
On board at last. Now for true peace! At least, the Captain says
he thinks it will be quiet enough when we get out. This enlivens
one for the hour of part-
ing. It has come. The
tender slowly moves off—
but there is, thanks to this
miserable notoriety, no
security against my most
innocent and natural
movements being chroni-
cled even at a moment like
this, for I see her bows are
crowded inconveniently
with Press Reporters. Yes,
I fully believe, were I to
be seen merely standing on
the top of the mizen-mast
on my head, but with a
full heart, and waving an
open red-umbrella in each
hand, as a parting fare-
well to my good English
friends,—it would be in
print to-morrow morning.
Oif! Shore left behind,
and the JJrittanic, splendid
vessel, battling bravely,
almost too bravely, with
the rolling of the grand
Atlantic. Survey it for a
few minutes, then lie down
in my cabin and repeat that
other Henry's Soliloquy on

Mr. Henry Irving, with his Hatt-on, doing

Sleep. Begin to wonder whether "the ship boy's eyes" are really
"sealed up upon the high and giddy mast." I can scarcely believe it
in such weather as this. I '11 ask the Captain. Ha! here lie is. He
asks me if I feel "pretty comfortable/' I tell him I feel as if I
had been upon the rolling billows all my life. So I do, and long
heartily for the shore! Never mind, there are no reporters here.
Finish my Soliloquy, "Uneasy lies the head that's upside down,"
and gradually succumb to the influence of "Nature's soft nurse."

received pecuniary advantage, still our "boys and girls" were
mulcted of money which, no doubt, would have been expended in
health - destroying sweetstufi, and our "bereaved ones" were
encouraged by finding themselves more than ever dependent upon
their own exertions to seek new protectors and marry again. Both
classes had the further satisfaction of knowing that I myself hac
personally lost nothing by my exertions—that, on the contrary, ]
had feathered that nest which should have been, and no doubt was
the object of their heartiest good wishes. So much for the past
Now for the future. Fired by the suggestions of Professor RICHARD-
SON and some of the scientists who took part in the recent proceedings
of the British Association, I have determined to devote the ample
leisure I have at my command to the advancement of science. Fron
my earliest days the deep has had a great attraction for me, anc
there have been but few or my ventures which have not, in one way
or another, merited the epithet of "fishy." Thus it is natural that
I should have searched the ocean for its secrets. In a word, I have
secured a Whale, and am anxious to find means of exhibiting it to a
learned community, always on the alert to add to the general know-
ledge which will be the heritage of the countless generations that are
to come after us.
As I am nothing if not truthful, I will briefly relate how the
monster came into my possession. Accompanied by Professor
WILLIAM JONES, whose many degrees (obtained in some of the most
famous of the American Universities) have made his name " as familiar
m our mouths as household words," I chartered a steam-yacht. We
started from Gravesend, and, passing Blackwall, Herne Bay, Mar-
gate, and many other interesting places, soon found ourselves in the
Arctic Regions. It was in this lonely spot, frequented only by the
fleet of the Chinese Penny Steamboat Company, that we found the
objects of our search. The vessel was too small to carry the whales,
so we called artifice to our aid. The creatures are most intelligent,
and yet, in spite of this trait in their character, are extremely fond
of peppermint drops. Knowing their peculiarities, my friend the
Professor had supplied himself with several ounces of the strongly-
scented lozenge in question, with a view to luring them (the whales,
not the drops) towards him. The huge creatures succumbed imme-
diately to the snare. The Professor threw a peppermint drop into the
iceberg-bearing ocean, and immediately a shoal of whales rushed
towards it. Having thus secured their attention, we got up full
steam and made for the Nore.
It was an imposing, a very imposing sight to witness the great
creatures, as they followed our yacht, snapping at the highly per-
fumed sweet-stuff, as Mr. JONES emptied his pockets for their benefit.
I append a sketch of the journey home. It will be recognised at a

A Journey through Whales,
glance by a true votary of Science as a most interesting addition to
contemporary investigation. The whales, the ships, the ocean, the
peppermint drops, made together a tableau once seen never likely
to be forgotten. All went well until we reached Southend, when, to
our great annoyance, our stock of lozenges became exhausted at the
very moment when the whales were jibbing at the pier. The Pro-
fessor immediately recognised the peculiarity of their conduct,
explaining that their obstinacy was caused by astonishment—that
no doubt the whales had seen nothing like the pier at the North Pole,
and were consequently puzzled, if not alarmed.
It would be wearisome to relate how our finny followers were
brought ashore, and finally sent to London by the Parcels Post: but
it is my duty to declare that, through some mismanagement or mis-
understanding, only one Whale reached Town in safety. When the
huge receptacle of the whales was opened in the presence of the
brightest ornaments of the scientific world, but a solitary inmate
was discovered. Havinp my pencil at hand, or rather in hand, I
hurriedly sketched the situation.
"Gentlemen," I said, "the others must have been lost in the—
here I restrained myself to shield Mr. FAWCETT'S employes, and
added," in the sea, in the sea!"

Rather Fishy.
And now, to be practical, I am in treaty with the Royal Society
to exhibit at sixpence a head this very interesting specimen of the
Common or (as it is rather small) I should say, Uncommon Whale.
But the members of the R. S. are very dilatory, and my funds are
exhausted. Under these circumstances mav 1 beg you to advance
me, at your very earliest convenience, a couple of thousand pounds.
No doubt, on application, the Authorities of the Fisheries (on the
matter being explained to them) would refund the money. Need I
say more? I think not. Yours most sincerely,

P.S.—Should it not be quite convenient to you to furnish so con-
siderable an amount, I would be equally satisfied with the ridiculous
sum of three and sevenpence halfpenny.

COMMON SENSE AND LICENCE.
WHERE LUSBY'S Music Hall, managed by a Mr. CHOWDER, may be
we haven't the smallest idea. We know nothing more about it than
what we gathered from the full report of Licensing Dav's Proceedings,
given in the Times of last Saturday; but we are delighted to see
that the Middlesex Magistrates, acting, on this occasion, in accord-
ance with the weight of evidence and the dictates of common sense,
renewed Mr. CROWDEH'S (of LUSBY'S) licence by a "vast majority."
Because a Mister CHARRINGTON chooses to be a virtuous Blue Rib-
bonman, "Hot Gospeller," and Tract-distributor, are there to be no
more Cakes and Ale and Comic Songs at LUSBY'S? The majority of
the Middlesex Magistrates have shown themselves opposed to bigotry
as irrational as it is uncharitable, and in favour of amusement
within reasonable limits. We trust that Mr. CHOWDER'S establish-
ment will be crowded nightly, and that Mr. CHARRINGION may be
there to assist in the harmony at LUSHBY'S,—we mean LUSBY'S.
Also the Middlesex Magistrates decided well in renewing the
licence for Mr. PURKISS'S Royal (College of) Music-Hall, therein fol-
lowing their Chairman Mr. POWNALL'S sensible advice, who himself
spoke to the respectability of the entertainment.
The people who object to such a song as " Tidings of Comfort and
Joy" as " injurious to religion," must have a queer idea of the sort
of religion which could suffer any injury from a song sung by a
comic-singer got up after the stvle of DICKENS'S Stiggins. a tjTje
rendered so familiar to us all by PHIZ'S pictures. Over-enthusiastic
Salvation-Army soldiers, very moody Moody-and-Sankeyites, and such
like, may recognise in the form of Stiggins some satire on their own
proceedings. But if they are wise, they would take the hint, and
reform.

THE Southend Local Board of Health, a few days ago, "consi-
dered" a letter that had been written to them from a gentleman
dating from Maidenhead, who apparently had discovered that the
"chief port at the mouth of the Thames in futuro " was uncommonly
like a place described in these columns under the title of " Eastend-
on-Mud." The Chairman, (Mr. BRIGHTEN, who very appropriately
took a rather cheerful view of the subject, observed, " I am sure we
laughed heartily at it." But a Mr. GOSSETT apparently found
it difficult to discover an answer to the question, "Who reads
Punch?" Well, we will try and find a solution to the conundrum.
We will tell our querist that all sensible people do who ran read, and
Serhaps Mr. GOSSETT may be able to do so—in time. Evidently he
oesn t at present, or his manners would be better. Punch emolht
mores, nee sinit esseferos.
GENERAL THIBAUDIN, their " only General"—at least the only on-'
who could be found to deal in a communistic, or rough and red-dj
fashion, with the Orleans Princes, and whose title to respect was his
having broken his parole d'honneur given to the Germans, has been
compelled, by M. FERRY'S determination, to resign. Who is to go
next. The PRESIDENT? Probably ; in which case he and the trucu-
lent THIBAUDIN will become two Red Heroes. What is on the bill
of fare to follow? Another hash, and the French, not stewed in their
own jus, will be done brown in their own GREVY. This will be a
pretty dish to set before a King! And all because of the wretched
Parisian Geese hissing at their Guest on Michaelmas Day!
SCIENCE AND FAITH.—In comparison with belief in the direct

ANOTHER LITTLE HOLIDAY CRUISE.
From Oban to Tubermory.—Beautiful sail. Arrive here earlier
than we' had expected: we did this also at Oban. Fortunate, as
scarcely.'are we in than a hurricane commences outside in the
Atlantic. The Atlantic is scarcely two steps round the corner.
Rain downpouring in buckets. Next day much the same, with
lucid intervals of sun. Walk on shore in morning, ditto in after-
noon. Haven't done so much walking for a long time as I have
within the last few days since I came out sailing. We walked at
Lame, we walked at Oban, we walk here. The \Vaterfalls are in
Mr. ALEXANDER'S private grounds—from the extent of his property
I should call him ALEXANDER THE GREAT—and there is no charge
for admission as there is at some places where they Ve only got a
two-penny waterfall to show for sixpence. CRAYLEY, with his glass
firmly screwed in his eye, and his head more on one side than
ever, examines the grand Waterfall critically, as though to detect
some flaw in it. MELLEVILLE regards it judicially, as if, with a
perfectly unbiassed mind, he were ready to hear both sides of any
question that may arise respecting the merits of the fall. (This
sounds theological.) I—such is the philosophic attitude of my mind
towards it—somehow seem to have seen it all before, and, not being
overpowered by it, begin, after a few seconds, to discover faces in
stones, and forms, more or less grotesque, in everything. CRAYLEY,
having gradually given up criticism, is now lost in admiration.
"And, like Niagara,
Finds it a staggerer,"
says KILLICK, favouring us with an impromptu, for which he is
instantly reproved by CRAYLEY, who tells him that "really he
(KILLICK) has no sort of reverence for the beauties of Nature."
"It's nothing extraordinary," retorts KILLICK. "I 've seen better
in Wales"
^"Never!" returns CRAYLEY, warmly. "This is distinctively Scotch.
You '11 seldom see anything like it in Wales, and never in the South
of England."
"Not in the South!" exclaims KILLICK. as if he were aghast at
what might be a daring imputation on his native place, which it
isn't, and I very much doubt whether he has ever been there.
"Why, in Devonshire and Cornwall the.Waterfalls are magnificent,
and twice as fine as this."
This is flatly contradicted by CRAYLEY. If they were alone, I
fancy it would end in a Sensation Scene, which could be thus
described in the bill:—" The Howling Cataract—View of the Devil's
Bridge—Moonlight—KILLICK meets CRAYLEY—The Assertion!—The
Contradiction!!—The Altercation!!!—FEARFUL STRUGGLE !!! !—
Awful Fate of the Victim—(either KILLICK or CKAYLEY)—Flight of
the Assassin—The Brand of Cain!!!!" &c.
As it is, however, this melodramatic termination to a pleasant
outing does not come off, as MELLEVILLE interferes in his_gentlest
and most soothing tones. It is (reporting it legally) Killick v.
Crat/let/, Mclkriue intervening. I am watching the case in the
interests of the general public.
"There are," observes MELLEVILLE in a marginal-reference sort
ofmanner, but speaking as an authority,—"There are some fine
Waterfalls in Devonshire and Cornwall, not unlike this, but perhaps
there are finer in the North of England, and we "—(this brings us
all into it)—" must remember we are seeing this on an exceptional
day, after a very heavy rain, and, indeed, while it is still raining. I
think we'd better get on." Both parties are silent before this
timely rebuke. It reminds me of the effect of one of Mr. Barlow's
lectures to Sandford and Merton. KILLICK is Sandford, and CHAYLEY,
Merton. So we move onwards, as the rain is falling heavily, and
we should soon be under shelter, but for the irrepressible impulse
which seizes upon every one or us to throw something into the
torrent (we are now standing at the highest point of the fall) merely
to see what becomes of it. If nothing else were obtainable, 1 believe
we should recklessly throw in our sticks and umbrellas, and even
our coats and hats, then laugh at them, and cheer idiotically. It
strikes me (philosophically and reflectively) that on occasions like
the present the savage nature of man has a fierce but momentary
struggle with his civilisation, and that if the savage nature once
got the upper hand, the result might take the form of the dreadful
practical joke of pushing the man nearest to the Waterfall suddenly
over, not exactly to procure his untimely end, but simply to
take him by surprise, to see how he liked it, and what the torrent

would do with him. I can perfectly imagine the Untutored' Savage
trying this sort of thing on another Untutored Savage not be-
longing to a hostile tribe, hut one of his own set, with whom he
might really he on such friendly terms as would warrant him
in taking an occasional liberty. The Untutored Savage has," of
course, a sense of humour; and if he is in the full enjoyment of the
highest possible animal spirits, what shape would his practical joke
take except one involving some sort of cruelty? The butter-slide, the
treatment of a baby, and the red-hot poker in a pantomime, come into
the Untutored Savage Practical Joke Category. (Note.—Reserve this
subject for Philosophical Treatise; pamphlet form; sixpence.)
Still at Tdbermory.—We are here to-day, and not gone to-morrow.
We have buoyed one another up with the cheeriest hopes as to being
able to sail to-morrow. MELLEVTLLE, as an experienced yachts-
man, has pointed out to us that when there are biggish waves in the
bay, the wind is expending itself, and that probably there '11 be a
comparatively calm sea, with the wind directly in our favour, all
ready for us to-morrow morning, as if it had been carefully ordered
overnight. We fish at intervals.
Note.—There is all the difference between "fishing" and
"catching." The men at the bows, when they let down their lines,
"cateh," but we at the stern only " fish."
Wind worse than ever in the night; rain also. Outside, i. e.,
round the corner in the Atlantic, it is now " blowing a gale "—so the
Captain says, and so also is the opinion of the Pilot. It must be, as
even in Tobermory Bay we are rocking as if we were in a roughish
sea. No chance of getting away. Books, the day before yesterday's
papers, the piano, and writing materials, are in requisition. We write
telegrams and letters, and then wait to see when there is a chance
of taking them to shore ourselves. About this time we try to think of
any person to whom we owe a letter, or a list of persons to whom we
haven't written for years, and who have almost cut us on account of
our apparent neglect. Xow is the moment to make up for lost time.
Blessings on the clan MC!NTOSH! We are waterproofed from head
to foot, and get a little exercise on deck.
Blessings on the proprietors, editors, and contributors to The
Scotsman. We can get no London papers here except those of the

of the day of its publication, by steamer, here at 5 P.M.—(but ordi-
narily half-an-hour or so late; no matter, blessings on the steamer

Wind and rain continuing. In the nipht other vessels have
dragged their anchors. We are swaying as if at sea. Wind roaring

ChiKsleioit, and imitating the sound of several steamers all working
their engines simultaneously. Yesterday's paper finished. I am
working hard at Clarissa ffarfotne. What a tediously told story,
and how utterly improbable are the incidents and the method adopted
for relating them. Lovelace is a'tremendous cad and snob. He'is,
thank goodness, as impossible a creature as one of OUIDA'S burlesque
heroes.-. BOSWELL's Tour of the Hebrides with Dr. JOHNSON in requi-
sition." Just the same sort of weather—continuous rain and wind a
hundred years ago in these parts. Another instance of History
repeating itself.
Locked up together in a yacht, we expend our temper—thongh
there isn't much of it among us—on Dr. JOHNSON and BOSWELL.
CHAYLEY says " he really doesn't see that JOHNSON said such very
clever things." I observe that he did " sometimes." KILLICK asks.
"When, he should like to know." I try to remember an instance of
a very clever saying of the Doctor's, which will settle the point in
dispute at once, but I can only think of—" Sir," said Dr. JOHSTSON,
"let us walk down Fleet Street"—which he couldn't have been
always saying, at all events not in Scotland.
• * * * * *
On quietly, with a view to future discussion, searching the Tour
of the Hebrides, I find that, a propos of such weather as we are now
having, Dr. JOHNSON did reply to BOSWELL, who had been complain-
ing of it—" Sir, we have no one to blame but ourselves for starting
to go from island to island under the impression that wherever we
were it must be summer."
And in spite of any protestations I might at different times have
made to the contrary, either out of compassion for my host's evident
annoyance, or to show with what philosophic equanimity all varia-
tions of temperature and weather can be endured, I must say that I
certainly held Dr. JOHNSON'S conviction implicitly; if not explicitly,
or I should never have been where I now am, i. c., on board, m
harbour within easy sight but difficult reach of land, being rocked to
and fro with a motion which is conducive neither to reading, writing,
nor thinking, while the wind is blowing great guns, the rain abso-
lutely cascading, and the vessel's timbers are literally shivering and
creaking and cracking like old furniture in a bedroom in the small
hours of the night.
Our host is quite distressed. He feels inclined to apologise to his
guests for the inclemency of the weather. Still, I would far rather
be here than in one of those isolated whitewashed cottages on one of
the deserted-looking islands which we have passed en route. At all
events, we have society, provisions, food, warm clothing, excellent
drinks, are well furnished with cigars, tobacco, and pipes, have
plenty of books, writing materials, sofas, rugs and wraps, games,
cards, piano, and a sufficient supply of music.
We actually are getting out our Bradshaws, our 3furrays, our
Scotch Railway Guides, with pencil and paper, to see what is the
best and shortest way back again to London!

ARTICLES DE PARIS.
IT is a capital idea, that occasional column one sees in the daily
papers headed "Guide to Visitors to Paris," and furnishing the
unsophisticated Briton, as it professes to do, with a "list of some
first-elass Houses, Hotels, and Establishments " where he can, with
confidence, respectively refresh and renew the inner and the outer
man; still it is possible to have too much of, or, rather, make too
much of even a good idea. For instance, it is all right enough to
send M. JOHN BULL, when decoyed from Son Isle by that attractive
form of a little social break-out, the desire for a'' few days in Paris,"
either to the Hotel Continental for his board and lodging, or to the
"Grand Magazine du Printemps," for Madame JOHN'S latest Paris
"Confections ;" but there are some things submitted to his insular
notice that scarcely come within the category of "necessaires de
rot/age." Take the following:—
IRRORS and FRAMES. Artistic. — LEVENS, Manufacturer,
9, Rue de 1'Eohelle. First-class assortment. No drawings sent.
Here is a distinct appeal to him to purchase off-hand a large look-
ing-glass, a piece of goods that must prove, by the way, highly
embarrassing in anything like a rough Channel passage; while,
again, this simple but wholesale domestic allusion—
BIBERON-ROBERT. Does not eihaust the children. Manufactory,
Place Daumesnil. Export.
s almost gloomy in its suggestion of perpetual home cares.
Take, too, the subjoined rather disquieting medical reminders:—
A LCOOL de MENTHE of RICQLES, superior for all stomach, head,
•tJL heart, and nerre diseases, &c. Forty-three years' success. Eight
golden medals, 25 rewards.—41, Rue Richer.
M1
PURIFIER of the BLOOD, Ringworm.
6, Rue Vivienne.
rriRUSSMAKER.—HENRI BONDETTI, 48, Rue Vivienne.
It may be fairly assumed that the blithesome traveller who cannot
get along without indulging in an outlay for one or more of these
useful but significantly penitential adjuncts to a holiday excursion,
had far better have never come abroad at all.
But it becomes clear from the nature of some of the Advertisements
that the proclivities of the British tourist are often regarded as
verging on the eccentric. Here are two selected at random:—
"DROQUET, Pumps, 121, Rue Oberkampt.
MACHINES for TILE and BRICK MANUFACTORY.—BOULET,

Why an Englishman who has innocently been doing the
"Louver " should suddenly wish to purchase a pump or "the ma-
chinery for a brick and tile manufactory," unless it be supposed that
having a tile of his own off, he might possibly desire to supply the
place of the latter, and then put himself under the former, it is
difficult to conceive.
Summing up the list, however, it is pleasing to note the following
concluding compliment to the cosmopolitan character of British
taste:—
TARDIN ZOOLOGIQUE d'ACCLIMATATION au BOIS de BOU-
tJ LOGNE.—Open every day. Live animals on sale. Catalogues for-
warded.
That after a few days in Paris, M. JOHN BULL should be en route
pour Son Isle with a van-load or two of furniture, materials for con-
structing a Water-Work Company and a second-hand Wild Beast
Show, Catalogue and all, evidently strikes the careful compiler of
the " Guide to Visitors to Paris" as " O yes—alright!"

"HAYDN'S DICTIONARY OF DATES."
SIB,—Last Monday there was a Concert whereat
Abbe FRAN/, LIZSTS compositions were performed.
The Abbe is, I believe, alive and well; but on referring
to HAYDN'S Dictionary of Dates (for 1870) I find this
entry:—
"LISZT, FRANZ, Hunprnrian AbW and Pianist. Born, 22
Oct. 1811 ; died, Oct. 1868."
HAYDN'S Compiler ought to have known, of course,
specially as in this very year 1870 Abbe FRANZ LIZST was
granted '' by Government" a pension of five or six hundred
a year for life. Artful Government this, if HAYDN'S Dic-
tionary of Dates (1870) is right; and the great Pianist
and Composer had died (without communicating the fact
to anybody except the compiler of this work) just two
years before. Why, this is quite a little "Haydn's
Surprise!" Yours, A. SHARP.

AFRAID I 'm too late for that " Fisheries " concern. Still, I '11 have
a shy. "Giant Octopus, I know," says a distant relative of his, '' has

Heard this morning from a friendly Whale, who is always picking
up the latest reliable gossip under the keels of the American liners,
that the Fisheries concern was nearly over. Said, though, that if I
wanted to go ashore, there was still money to be made by " starring."
Suggested Aquarium as best place to begin. If you 're a success,
you "re put on posters, go round provinces, then cross to the States.
They all do it. Jumbo did it. COLERIDGE is at it. IRVING 's doing
it now. If I had only known that, would have turned up in the
middle of the Atlantic, had a good look at him, and got out of him
all about terms. However, here goes for the shore for a little busi-
ness on my own account.

Bless me, what a job I 'ye had to get here! And the Thames

Lambeth Tier. Told him I had nearly carried away Waterloo Bridge
coming through, and as I 'm speaking reach as far as Erith, and am
at this moment tickling the Pier witn my tail. Says I ought to be a
"big thing." Say I am. Asks me if I think I could show 'em "a
bit of deep sea life" in a nice comfortable tank, forty-two feet by
six. Terms, one per cent, on gross receipts, to be put to my credit
in any sand bank I like to name, including one-o clock dinner on

No—after turning it well over—can't say I see it. Anyhow—not

A DRIVE ON THE MOORS.
THE REVOLUTION OF THE 'CYCLES HAS BBOUOHT MANY STRANGE THINGS TO PASS—WHY NOT THIS 1
ANOTHER LITTLE HOLIDAY CRUISE.
(On to Loch Scavaig.)
Evening of Third Day at Tobermory. — MELLEVILLE, our Commo-
dore, says 1 hut the glass is rising, the wind abating;, and that we shall
sail to-morrow. General excitement. "The wind," he explains, "will
be freshish. I expect," he adds, "that Madame Creusa will jump a
bit outside." We all say, "Oh, never mind that," and determine
that we are ready for all risks rather than remain inactive in
harbour. "We are advised to "belay," and make everything " taut"
in our cabins. Ominous, but exciting. KILLICK says he hopes he '11 be
all right. I join KILLICK; but somehow, though I wouldn't on any
account remain in harbour any longer, yet, to adapt the line from Sir
Jf MOOSE'S burial, I " doubtfully think of the morrow."
I" The morrow. Wake early with headache. The Merry Young
Steward, entering with early coffee, says, "We 're under weigh "—
on shore he is a young London valet, but here he is more nautical
than any of the sailors)— so that I have slept through all the pre-
paratory noises.
"Not at present,
she '11 jump a bit outside, __ _. _______ „__ ___,
before she does "jump a bit outside," and complete my toilette while
a perpendicular position is possible. I do so, as far as I can, but in a
few minutes I am forming, with the floor of my cabin, an angle of
seventy-five. Getting hungrier and hungrier. I foresee my fate.
'' Jump a bit outside I" 0 dear!
Breakfast. — To my surprise I can eat a hearty breakfast, and feel
much better, in spite of the table being one minute up to my chin,
and the next touching my knees. In waterproofs (" Dressed
ac-Cording-ly," the Commodore says, — hate jokes to-day) I struggle
on deck. Here I manfully take my stand, holding on by a rope, and
becoming more and more uncertain every quarter-of-an-hour.
KILLICK has disappeared. CRAYLEY, who is a frail creature, and
generally suffering from headaches, is exceptionally well, and sits in
a chair perfectly calm and happy, his head on one side, critically
examining the waves (such waves !) through his eye-glass. I envy
him. I envy MELLEVII.LE, who has a chart before him. I could no
more examine that chart now than I could leave my rope, or take
my gaze (I feel^it is a glassy stare) off the sea. I am becoming fixed
in one position, like one of Madame TUSSATTD'S effigies. I should like
a label up with,' ' Please don't touch the figure." Also, '' Don't speak
to the figure." In general, I don't want any notice taken of me.
KILLICK, after an hour's seclusion, comes up on deck as fresh as a
lark — though I doubt whether a lark would find himself so very
fresh when a yacht is "jumping a bit outside" in the Atlantic.
Who said he was " disappointed with the Atlantic"? I think it
was Mr. OSCAB WILDE when he was crossing over to America. I
don't care, as far as the sea-voyage goes, to be any nearer America
than I am at present; but I certainly am not disappointed with as
much as I have at present seen of the Atlantic. Its waves are mag-
nificent. They may be bigger and grander elsewhere, but these
will do for me. Yes, they will emphatically "do for me." I am
only disappointed with myself. For two hours I stand expecting
the worst, and hoping for the best. "To be, or not to be," thai is
the question. By twelve o'clock it is solved: it is " to be." With
a sudden rush to leeward—which makes them think I am bent on
suicide—I surrender myself, cheerfully, to the consequences. I
comfort myself by saying, "It will do me good." And I devoutly
hope it will, as it does me awfully bad at the moment.
Then I retire. With difficulty I reach my cabin, with difficulty I
lie down. And then—then! it feels as if someone were taking me
up by the heels, and jobbing my head downwards against the pillow.
For the remainder of the day I lie here, vainly trying to sleep, and
sincerely wishing I could gag KILLICK (whose getting well so quickly
I secretly resent), whose speaking voice I hear every minute laughing,
talking, asking inane questions, and preventing my going to sleep.
If I could get at KILLICK, and strangle him, I might be better. But
I can't shout, I can't get off my berth, and there is no bell. The
Merry Young Steward has looked in once, has fastened the blind
across the skylight to keep out the sun, and has not returned. At
5'30 I hear the welcome grating of the anchor-chains, and "the
movement in sea" ceases.
I prepare for dinner, by trying to part my hair and making
myself look less "glazy." I appear as a convalescent. We are
moored in Loch Scavaig, Isle of Skye, a fearfully wild spot, which
might have been the country residence of the Three Witches in
Macbeth. Just the place for their meeting here to-night, now that the
"hurly-burly's done." The guide-book writers exhaust the vocabu-
lary of abusive admiration for Loch Scavaig, until one of them,
unable to hit on any more appropriate simile, calls it " The Avernus
of the North."
To-morrow we are to make a "facilis dtscensus" on the Avernus
"sed revocare qradum "—and how tired I shall be! How tired I am!
Like the lover in LOVER'S Irish ballad, "I am not myself at all;"
though it would be difficult to say who I am.
I can't smoke: my favourite drinks are abhorrent to me: my diet
has been of the plainest. Messmates, good-night! And so at an
early hour I retire to my berth; and as I undress, commune with
myself somewhat to this effect:—" Would I buy a yacht if I had the
money? Would I hire one for a couple of months' holiday trip?
Would it be the most satisfactory way of spending a vacation? If
fine, it is delightful—I mean if tine and fairly calm, and going before
the breeze; but if not, if blowy, if "jumping a bit." or with a head-
wind, or at sea quite out of reach of land, and unable to put in any-
where and come to an anchor for/dinner—how would that be for
a holiday? Supposing, too, that all my companions were to suffer
as I (evidently) should, why, it.would be merely a floating hospital."
However, before arriving at our destination, I am likely to be sorely
tried again, and so I wifl snatch a " fearfuljoy " to-morrow on shore
by " doing " Avernus, "and after" Now, bed.
Off Avfrnus Loch Scavaig, Isle of Skye.—Merry Young Steward
enters cabin at 6'45. Fine morning. I am better, but only conva-

lescent. Very cautious at breakfast, Roughish. wet on deck, and
cold: bathing not enticing, "on account," the Merry Steward says,
"of the dog-fish." The dog-fish, it appears, are of the Shark family,
—young Scotch or Hebridean sharks—and if you bathe, but, in
fact, nobody does bathe where the dog-fish are.
No one feels better for yesterday's gale.
With waterproofs on, we put off in gig. Avernus looks more
Avernus than ever as we get nearer and nearer. Not a living soul
to be seen; not a sign of habitation. The tops of the mountains are
enveloped in mist, which is slowly rising. This part of Skye can
only be inhabited by ghosts of departed Scotchmen who have come
"bock agen." I should not be in the least surprised were LOCKE'S
Witches' Chorus in Macbeth to be heard behind those heavy mists,
or were we actually to come upon the Weird Sisters out for a holiday
—a Witches' Sabbath—picnicking around their cauldron, and rising
to dance to a tune played by Tarn CfShanter's goblin piper! In fact,
nothing supernatural would astonish me here. I should be prepared
for anything—except seeing Skye-terriers in Skye! Don't believe
there are any. Should say that they had all turned into dog-fish.
It is not easy walking. Big black boulders, sometimes enormous,
presenting the appearance of buried elephants, their backs only being
visible, petrified by time and exposure; the devious tracks between
the buried elephants' backs—which it would be flattery to call sheep-
walks—are composed of bits of rock, shifty sand, heather-moss, and
peat-bog of a very deceptive character. The Sun suddenly comes
out, and, when it does so, it comes out very strong, so that we take
off our waterproof-coats and caps, and breathe more freely. We
have scarcely experienced this relief for three minutes, than down
pours the rain, and on have to go our coverings again. There is no
faith to be placed in the climate of Scotland. CRAYLEY, generally
rather an invalid, and short-sightedj skips from rock to rock,—
like a mountain-goat with a glass in its eye. EILLICK is in
the height of good-humour because everyone else—even CHAYLBY
occasionally—is more or less in difficulties: and he has managed to
get well in front, and then asks the others why we don't come on P"
Sun shining. Very hot as we re-embark in the gig.
Happy Thought.—Bathe before lunch. No dog-fish close to shore.
Not deep enough for them, and they 're too deep for it.
For once, all agree to this. Yes, just the very time! No iooner is
this settled, than the wind begins to blow, the wavei to rise, the
spray to attack us, so that we have to resume our mackintosh*!—
and in another second we are all complaining of cold, and decide,
nem. con., that we can't bathe with any sort of comfort to-day.
Lunch. Directly the eating and drinking is finished, we are off.
I am still cautious, and do not rush up on deck in too great a
hurry. They tell me the wind will be with us the whole time.
"Now we sail tcith the gale "—only, it is not, thank goodness! a
gale, merely a breeze.

"DISINTEGRATION!"
"Like Achilles emerging from his tent, ho is evidently determined that

it overthrows his own friends almost as completely as his opponents."—The

En AVAST! Ah, Sir Knight, a redoubtable cry,
Calculated, you think, scattered forces to rally.
The time for tent-dwelling you deem is gone by,
And so arm cap-a-pie for a desperate sally.
Unequalled at onset, a Rupert at least,
With a dash of Murat and a touch of Achilles.
And then what a charger! A thoroughbred beaat,
Who pules about prudence then? Out on such sillies!
The foes? Sore discouragement reigns in their hosts,
The Radical ruck will not fight long together.
And as to the Whigs, poor lost wandering ghosts,
They would only too gladly escape GLADSTONE'S tether.
Their low imprecations have greeted your ears,—
How sad is their lot whose sole solace is cursing!
The country, heart-sick of the barren three years,
Its fiat but waits a fair chance of reversing.
En tirant, then! Of course! A beau labreur like you
Is the very commander for such an occasion.
For quieter times gentle STAFFT may do,
With his love of fair fence and fine chivalrous suasion.
He and SMITH and that queer Red CROSS Knight and the rest,
Very stodgy old-stagers, want rallying slightly;
Their usage of you has been none of the Dest,
You will show what it means to be dashing and knightly.

One quite a la DIZZY,—'tis " Disintegration!"
Sounds awe-striking, doesn't it? Vagueness has force,
And, like Chinamen's bogey-shields, wakes trepidation
In—well, that'» the question. To frighten your foes
By war-whoops is possible—when they are savages;
But cui bono chargers and fins swashing blows,
If in your own ranks they are found making ravages?
'Ware heels! How he backs and buck-jumps, your brave steed!
What a shower of splashes behind him he spatters!
SMITH doesn't half like it, and STAFF must take heed.
Rather rum Rosinante who followers scatters I
The cool Standard-keener looks Hurried and cross.
The gig-lamps of CHOSS gleam "so savage and Tartarly,"
And grandmother NOETHCOTE exclaims, "Drat that 'oss"!
Call this a Review? It must be the hind-Quarterly.'"
Ah! RuPEBT-cuM-QurxOTE, deliberate dash
Is a capital thing, when well-timed and well-measured.
But the leader who leads to surrender or smash.
Though he charge like a torrent, not long will be treasured.
You 've tried the Thor-hammer tornado-like style
Once or twice, and its end has been—capitulation.
The foe at your charger and war-whoop will smile,
If amidst your own ranks they bring " Disintegration."
A REVIEWER REVIEWED.—But for G. A. S.'s reference to it in his
"Echoes," only a select few would have known anything about the
Saturday Review article on our hearty condemnation of RABELAIS. The
Reviewer, after agreeing with us on our two essential points, firstly,
that RABELAIS requires a thorough cleansing before he can be intro-
duced into the polite society of to-day, and secondly, that, perhaps,
after all, Professor MOELET had better have left the " dirty old black-
guard" and all his works alone,—attempts to represent him as a highly
moral and kindly old cleric, on the strength of a few passages in his
writings, gems which, to our thinking, are not worth wading through
the intolerable muck to pick up. But as the writer has evidently
only selected this congenial subject in order to use it as a stalking-
horse for a malicious attack on ourselves, Mr. Punch leaves him to
splash about to his heart's content in his own ink-pool, from which
he may emerge as clean as RABELAIS himself could wish to see him.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEL

TRIBUTE DEW TO BEN NEVIS.
JUST NOW THE OBSERVED OF ALL OBSERVERS. MRS. CAMERON CAMPBELL
CROWNS THB EDIFICE.
THE SPEAKER.
(A Handbook to Ready-made Oratory.}
PAST I.—LOYAL TOASTS.
ALMOST everybody can manage to propose the health of Royalty.*' The subject
carries with it regulation applause and conventional enthusiasm. The proposer
of "The Queen should adopt an official tone, as if for the nonce he were
Premier or Lord Chancellor. He should convey the idea that he was on terms
of respectful familiarity with Her MAJESTY—that it was no unusual thing for
him to drop in to five o'clock tea at Balmoral, or lunch at Windsor. That in
spite of this friendly feeling he yet could be an impartial critic, and in that
character had come to the conclusion that Monarchy was a decidedly sensible
and useful institution. But perhaps to show exactly what is meant, the Handbook
may drop for a little time into a theatrical form.
SCENE—A Banqueting Hall. Principal guests on a raised platform. Remainder
seated at long tables. The grace has been said or sung. There is much
noise, and then a silence as a Gentleman with a double eyeglass—ought to
have a double eyeglass when you want to propose "The Queen "—rises
slowly and with much dignity. Rather intoxicated applause, which is checked
by Toast Master, who begs all present to " charge their glasses."
Toast Proposer (looking at a list before him through his glasses, and then bowing
to a Feeble Youth on his right}. My Lord— (abruptly)—-and Gentlemen—(ap-
plause]—when an assembly of Englishmen—(pause)—I repeat, Englishmen—
(applause)—meet together anywhere, it is at once their duty and their pleasure
to drink the health of their Sovereign. (Cheers.) It is unnecessary for me to
say that (Here follows what it is unnecessary for him to say about the lore of
the Briton for the Throne, &c., &c.) But why should I detain you longer?
(A conundrum which is given up by all present.) The toast will be drunk by you
all with enthusiasm.
But, before I
permission—(Feeble Youth smiles vaguely)
this gathering—but perhaps I weary you—(Cries of " No, no!" and " Go on ! ")
—that had Her MAJESTY Known that this gathering—but there—(with a diplo-
matic smile, and beating time with his double eyeglass)—this is scarcely the
moment for explanation. All I would say, and I say it with the utmost hearti-
ness, my Lord and Gentlemen—the Queen! (Sits down
with the air of an Archbishop who, having just delivered
an episcopal charge, is now bent upon retiring into private
life with as much humility as his high position admits.
If the Chairman is able to give an anecdote about
Royalty, a great chance is opened, to those who listen to
him, of confirming his statement by a loud "hear,
hear!" that argues that they (the utterers of the "hear,
hear! ") know as much about the matter as the Speaker
himself. This "hear, hear!" is very useful when
members of the Royal Family are mentioned. Thus a
pushing Physician or a "Society Barrister" can convey
a world of information in a cheer, confirmatory of the
platitudes that " the Princess is beautiful," "the Prince
is as good-natured as he is conscientious to perform his
public duties," and that "the Duke is a most able sea-
man." A certain Doctor has been known to bring tears
into the eyes of all present by the deeply sympathetic
tone in which he has applauded the remark that "the
Duke of CONNAUGHT has ever preferred duty to pleasure."
The learned healer on hearing this statement is wont
to look up sharply at the speaker, shake his head slowly,
sigh, and observe, "Hear, hear!" in a voice suggestive
of a response in church.
In proposing the members of the Royal Family, it is
as well to bear in mind their chief characteristics. The
Prince and Princess may be left out of the collection,
as everyone knows their excellent qualities. Here follows
a list:—
Duke of Edinburgh.—Sailor. Plays the fiddle like an
angel. Married to rich Russian Princess. Friend of Sir
ABTHUH SULLIVAN. Name of His Royal Highness can
be easily introduced a propos of the Fisheries Exhibition,
Diamonds, Coastguard Service, Nihilism, and H.M.S.
Pinafore.
Duke of Connaught.—First-class Soldier, covered with
Egyptian medals. Married to daughter of "the Red
Prince." Has served in Artillery, Rifle Brigade, and
Hussars. Is now a Colonel in the Guards. Useful orna-
ment to dissertation upon the toast, "The Army, Navy,
and Volunteers." His Royal Highness may be called '' the

Duke of Albany.—Scientific. Called after the old King
of the Belgians. Was at Oxford. Connected more or less
with South Kensington; Upton Park Road, Bedford Park;
the Kyrle Society; and Cremona violins. Is walking

sort, &c., &c.
Prince Teck.—Served with distinction as a letter-
carrier on the field of Tel-el-Kebir, sold furniture of
Kensington Palace by auction, and retired abroad. Name
of no great value to anyone. Is a "Serene Highness."
Semi-royal joke to be used rather late in the evening,
"As the Duke takes adversity and prosperity with equal
equanimity, in years gone by he would have been called
an 'All Serene Highness.""
A Royalty returning thanks will speak of the "Duchess
and himself" as being greatly gratihed at " the very kind
manner " in which the toast has been received. He will
be also pleased (when receiving a deputation for instance
on landing after a particularly rough passage), "at the
expression of loyalty to the QUEEN, to which the Mayor
and Corporation will give vent. At a few moments' notice
he will learn the name of the town and its chief product,
and introduce both into his reply, and suggest that, as
he was not lucky enough to be born there, "he should be
very pleased to be associated with so interesting a part
of Her Majesty's dominions." But even this is scarcely
necessary. Should the Royalty be heard, so much the
better; but should his voice be weak, it will be drowned
by the cheers, and nothing of the speech will catch the
populace. And—once again—sometimes so much the
better!

Uncivilised and slow,
And every way that Europe went,

WoRDERFUL how }*. got along in the old empirical rule-of-
thumb times, when de minimis non curat leg.was indeed a verity:
Why, de minimis is the theme and care of the Minute Philosopher, and
lez is every day dealing more, closely and rigorously with what are
erroneously called the “small ini. of life. Our only difficult
is to get Law to move fast enough. wought to fit in like a secon
skin.” And it doesn't—yet. Look at Breathing, for instance! The
most important action of Life, and Law hardly touches it. Fools
have a frantic notion that they may respire just as they please,
breathe freely, as they would say, What can be more absurd? I have
been thinking a deal about Breathing lately. It is a sadly neglected
subject. Doctors, indeed, have written books about “The Air we
Breathe,” but, how about the way in which we breathe it? A virgin
ubject, which I, John PARTLET, M.U.B.S., have made my own.
Shall not write to *. about it this time, or read a “Paper.”
No. I shall write a Handbook! It has long been the ambition of
my life to write a Handbook, and here's my chance. Such a subject!
Who knows just how many respirations per minute he ought to allow
himself in all given circumstances? y, nobody. My Handbook
witjiaii about it. it will be called Thºrationale of Respiration;
or, How to Breathe, When to Breathe, and Where to Breathe. If it
doesn't create an Eºch, I 'm a-Fustiva !
-
-
An important section of my Handbook will be devoted to demon-
strating that the mode and rate of the respiration of the Individual
should, in the interests of the Community, be regulated by Law. Free
Breathing has doubtless been the curse of the world. ... I'm astonished
—but glad—that no one ever thought of this before. Breathe freely—
which means capriciously and unscientifically-indeed! Monstrous!!
In view of the Lung-Furnace Theory and the awful unplumbed pos-
sibilities of GERMs, I do not hesitate to say that empirical, lawless
respiration is High Treason to the Race / My Handbook will
prove it.

And yet what a lot of people there are still left!, The Survival of
the Unfit ! There’s a promising subject! I must think it over, and
perhaps prepare a paper on it for the coming Pancosmical Congress.

BETWEEN China and France there exist “complications,”
Which have “strained” to the utmost their “mutual relations,”
Till they now have arrived at a state of such “tension”
As to furnish occasion for “grave apprehension; ”
And, because they are quite the reverse of “elastic.”
They are likely to snap. But a remedy “drastic,”
As the safest and surest of friendly advice is,
Would but sharply “accentuate” this present “crisis.”

WENETIAN Blinds? I hate 'em, yet they always seem to me

Connected with that period they all ºi. to be
With port and polished tables made of dark ma-hog-a-nee.
In spite of all these memories, I think you’ll feel inclined
To speak in terms disparaging the old Wenetian Blind!
Though boasting many virtues, it is not possessed of one;
It keeps your room as dark as night or dazzles you with sun;
It has a cord of many knots, not one of them is right,
And halyards which will never work to turn it “dark” or “light.”
'Tis noisy, too, and cumbersome—you K. it up with dread,
It comes down with a clatter on your shoulder or your head!

They often break quite suddenly, and, as the blind you scan,
It gives an imitation of an epileptic fan
You may storm and you may bluster, may objurgate and frown
When down, you cannot get it up; when up, can't get it down!
Though workmen come and workmen go—you’ll have to be resigned,
And spend a little fortune on the old Venetian Blind!
I wonder who invented it, and was he known to fame?
I feel so very certain that it ne'er from Venice came;
It never sheltered Doges from the ardent solar rays,
Nor screened Venetian beauties from their lovers' longing gaze!
It must have been invented by some fiend in human shape,
To give the world a trouble that it never could escape—
For health and wealth and łº, and ease and peace of mind,
All perish in the worry of the old Venetian Blind!

Those swings and merry-go-rounds in the neighbourhood especially
add greatly to the appearance of Osborne from the sea.
As Wentnor now an Aquarium, three Music-Halls, and a

No, it is not true that the Poet-Laureate has consented to read
“Morte D'Arthur” from a bathing-machine on Bonchurch beach, in
return for a per-centage paid by the Railway Company on every
excursionist brought down by the “Tennyson Express.” .
Is it possible that the South-Western really does the distance to
Ryde now in twelve hours?
The invalids in the hospital seem quite to enjoy the sound of the
five rival brass bands on #. Pier.
And, finally, it is perfectly correct that the hotel-proprietors,

You should make him dp what everybody else does; go into trade,
or keep a shop, or something, you know. Why doesn't he sell wine?
Mrs. Hardup. Oh, he has done that. He was Chairman of that
Thuringian Claret Company; and we got ever so many people about
us, to take a quantity. But it fermented—or did something stupid;
and they do say it killed the poor Duke, who was very kind to
HAKRY, you know, and took a hundred dozen at once. And now, of
course, there's no sale—or whatever they call it; and HARRY says if
it can't be got rid of to a firm of Blue Ink Makers, who are inquiring
about it, it will have to go out to the Colonies as Chateau Margaux
—at a dreadful loss. (Summing up.) I don't believe the men under-
stand trade a bit, dear. So I 'm going to do something for myself.

of them for me to your friends, at seven guineas a-piece.

and the GREVTLLE girls, and the PONSOITBY TEMPLARS, and, oh, I

nothing but painting butterflies and sprigs on over-sized soup-plates

THE SPEAKER.
(A Handbook to Ready-made Oratory.)
PART II.—POLITICAL STUMP SPEECHES.
THE Parliamentary Debater who is permitted by Ms party to per-
ambulate the country for the purpose of indulging in "out-of-Session
utterances" is invariably a practised Speaker. At Westminster he
has been tried before all sorts of audiences, from the full House of a
"big fight" right down to the "two men and a Speaker" of a "nothing-
serious-on" dinner-hour. Consequently it would be an act of superero-
gation, not to add impertinence, to teach such an orator what to say
and how to say_ it. For all that the Stump Speaker may be benefited
by a few practical hints. It will be as well for his Private Secretary,
having obtained a chart of his Chiefs projected tour, to go over the
ground beforehand, either in person or in spirit, as "an agent in
advance." The Secretary should ascertain the characteristics of the
people who live in the various places through which his master will
have to travel, and then should proceed to draw up a sort of tabular
report. For instance, say the Right Hon. Sir)MAYPOLE WAISTCOAT
intends a little trip to the West. He is going from England to Ire-
land, and returns by Wales. The following might be an extract
from the Private Secretary's memorandum-book:—

Of course the above is merely the roughest of rough guides. A
good Private Secretary will find, out whether a political speaker has
ever been killed by a brickbat or pelted with rotten eggs. He will
see that his Chief is properly dressed to meet any emergency. In
Blunderton the Right Hon. MAYPOLE might wear a yachting costume
to suggest that his heart is in the proper place, and sympathises with
the toilers of the sea. In Castle Shillelagh a complete suit of steel
armour, worn under the cloth clothes, would be imperatively neces-
sary to prevent accidents. For Glenbyggygy, a dress suggesting
intimate acquaintanceship with the more respectable of the Music
Hall agents would seem advisable. There are a number of " Bards"
wandering about Wales who would feel impressed at meeting a
gentleman who appeared likelv to be able to get them " a turn" at
some Metropolitan " Palace of Varieties." As to the subject-matter
of the speech, that is an affair of no great importance. Of course the
oration should be written out beforehand, and " communicated" to
the Press, for transmission to London. What is actually spoken on
the spot is seldom heard by anyone save the reporter, who, however,
having a "corrected slip," listens with very little attention. The
stumper must do his best to keep his temper. He must remember
that although his words are intended for the whole world, upon his
personal demeanour will depend the party retention of a seat. He
consequently will do his best to be all smiles and affability. If he
happen to have rather a quick temper, it will be as well for him to
rehearse the part he will have to play, with his Private Secretary,
who should be an accomplished Amateur Actor. To more fully
explain the meaning of the above, the Guide drops for the nonce into
a dramatic form :—
SCENE—Interior of the Right Hon. Gentleman's Study. Mr. TF.N-
TEEFOBE (the Private Secretary) discovered atcaiting his Chief's
appearance. Enter Sir MAYPOLE. Mr. TENTEBFOKE rushes up
to him, and seizes him by the hand.
Sir Maypole. This is the proudest
Mr. Tenter/ore (interrupting). Stop, Sir MAYPOLE! I am imper-
sonating the Mayor, and in that character must shake hands with
you for ten minutes, and talk rubbish to you for three-quarters of an
hour.
Sir Maypole. All right! Go on! [Hii Secretary goes on.
Mr. Tenterfore. Stop, stop, Sir MAYPOLE! You are actually
going to sleep!
Sir Maypole. Only closing my eyes, my dear fellow—only closing
my eyes.
Mr. Tenterfore. But you mustn't close your eyes. And that
speech-receiving smile of yours is scarcely natural enough.
Sir Maypole (annoyed). Tut, tut! And yet I have practised it
every day lor the last six months, in the looking-glass, while I was
shaving!
Mr. Tenterfore (encouragingly). Oh, it will come in'time. And
now, Sir MAYPOLE, will you please mount this table?
[The Right Hon. Gentleman obeys, and immediately comes a
"cropper."
Sir Maypole (getting up). I say, this is beyond a joke! I have
hurt myself!
Mr. Tenterfore. I got a weak table purposely. Sorry to inconve-
nience you, Sir MAYPOLE, but you must accustom yourself to these
little contretemps. And now, if you will make your speech, I will
interrupt you in the customary places, and pelt you at the points
where I think it is most probable you will receive a hot reception.
Sir Maypole (doubtfully). I say, you have no stones or dirty

[Scene closes in upon the Right Hon. Gentleman learning his
lesson.
It will be seen from the above that the speeches of a first-class
political Stump Orator require considerable rehearsal before they can
be considered ready for the public ear. If the Speaker is very
popular, and selects his resting places, or rather non-resting places,
with care, no doubt he will escape the pelting and interruptions.
But he can never feel thoroughly safe from the other inflictions. He
must always put up with the fussy garrulity of provincial nobodies,
and will scarcely ever be able to quite rely upon the stability of his
platform. It will be as well for him to glance at the table or chair
he is invited to occupy before mounting. Some furniture will not
stand fervid eloquence. He should avoid hurling messages of defiance
at anyone unless he is standing in a waggon or a railway carriage.
If he wishes to be unusually emphatic, he should carry his own plat-
form with him. But this should be only done in an acute crisis, as
the local upholsterer might consider himself defrauded of his just
perquisites.
To sum up. A political Stump Orator should attend chiefly to the
necessities of the outer man. He must look after his voice, and be
careful not to catch cold. He should go to bed with his head
swathed in flannel, and live chiefly upon rump steak and cough
lozenges. If he obeys these rules, he will return to the bosom of his
family but little the worse for wear. As for his speeches, they can
shift for themselves. And it is a notable fact that the speeches of
some stumping Parliamentarians are particularly shifty.

IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LAW COURTS.
As they have already fitted up one of the Lord Chief Justice's Courts with
sliding desks, useful for the barristers in very cold weather when they can take
exercise and " keep the pot a bilin'" at luncheon-time, or previous to the Judge's
arrival, why not try the following suggestions ?—
1. Contrive the floor of the Court like a stage—traps with trap-doors, and all
the appliances of wheels, pulleys, cranks, slotes, and windlasses. In the Criminal
Court the prisoner, guarded, should be brought up, slowly and solemnly, a great
effect, on a lift. If music could be added to this, so much the better. A soothing
"voluntary" on a concealed organ would put evervone in proper dispositions.
2. The jurv-box should also be "worked" from below; not in two long
"grave traps,1' as they are called on the Stage, but each Juryman should have
his own square trap fitting into its proper place in the box above, and when his
cue came,—that is, when his name was called,—he should be taken up on the
trap sharply, so as to say, "Here!"
3. The presiding Judge, or Judges, should always enter through a "vampire"
trap, that is, a spring panel in the wall just behind the judicial bench. Or he
might seat himself in full costume on a chair, and, on touching a spring, this
could be wheeled forward through the panel doors, and come out exactly opposite
his desk, all ready to begin.
Nothing can be more inconvenient than the old-fashioned pews for Counsel,
but the above alterations should be first tried by a full Court and a Special
Jury, and if the verdict is favourable,—of which there can be hardly a doubt,—
the "Court, so improved, will be at once acknowledged as the Superior Court, and
we will then make further beneficial suggestions.

he will say, and then he will go on reading and reading

himself on his uncommon sharpness. We venture to say
that it is one of Miss BRADDON'S best-written books, and
our advice to everyone is " Read it."

SEENTIFFIC STAGGERERS.
WHAT a trewly wunderfool Body is the
grate Copperashun of the Citty of London!
Not content with feesting of Princes and
Docks and Markesses and Barrens by the
score and Hem Peas by the bushel, to speak
allegollycally, they has akshally ;now took
it into their wise eds to ask a lot of mosl
imminent sientific swells and littery men to
cum and have a bit of dinner with 'em,
aye, and not ony that, but they akshally
give 'em evry think of the best, such as reel
turtel and '74 port, just as if they 'd bin
million-hares instead of poor fellers as as to
work for their living j ust like an hed Waiter.
They 'd all evidently put their best close on,
and tried their werry best to look quite at
their ees, as they sat all of a roe, tho' they
was surrounded by Lord Mares and Sher-
ryffs and Haldermen, which in course must
ha" bin werry trying to their unacustumd
nerves. And to see the way in witch them
distingwished dignerterries tried to make
'em feel cumferable by their condsendin
afferbilerty amost drew teers to my eyes.
They eviedently sukseedid, for wether it
was the not being kwite used to our re-
markerably fine Port, I never seed a lot of
gents, of their rayther low order, talk away
at sitch a rate as they did. Fortnitly for
them the Chairman was a sientifie gent, as
well as being a werry uncommon Council-
man, so he kindly let 'em go a-ramblin' on,
jest as if he bleeved they was in earnest,
and if they didn't throw the long bow and
draw the Atchet to an extent as even I never
eard ekwalld, no, not even after dinner, wen
most folks seems to think as eating inkreeses
the power of swallering, why, my name
ain't ROBERT, but JON, or sum sitch low
name.
Suppose as I gives jest one or two xam-
pels of what I shoud call "Sientiffic
Staggerers."
One reely quite respekabel looking Gent,
who told 'em as he was imployd in the
Oineral Post Office, praps as a "Sawter or
summit of that grinding sort, akshally sed
as he wunce stood in the middle of the Brord
Hatlantick, witch I am told is a sort of
fancy name for the American See, and sent
a messidge to his masters in Sum Martens-
leegran and got his anser back by return
of post, without noboddy not going ashore!
And the good nachered Chairman kindly
looked as if he bleeved him!" Ah." as I
sed to BROWN, "tell that to the Marines,
even an ed waiter can't swoller that."
And not only an ed Waiter, but I seed the
smile of pitiful contemp on the npbel coun-
tingance of more than one iminint corpo-
rator. Encurridged aperiently by the Chair-
man's mistaken kindness, the Gineral Post-
man, whose name I lernt was PREECE,
drank off a bumper of our best Port, jest
as if he was quite used to it, and gave us
another staggerer. He akshally said as he
had once stood on the shore of Wales and
talked to a friend in Dublin?, witch I need
scarcely add is in lerlan, and asked him if
he could tell his woice, and his friend-not
to be outdone in staggerers, replied " Yes.
I can. and I can smell your sigar!'
Well this was just a little too much for the
swoller even of a Common Councilman
after dinner, so they all bust out into a loud
larf, but he wasn't a bit ashamed of hisself,
but finishd up by saying; that it was not
unpossible but that we might some day be
able to see all our ants and our sisters and
our cozens at the other side of the world.
Pretty well that for a Gineral Postman
when allowed to drink '47 Port " at indis-
cretion" as the French says.

and he would pledge himself, either at Mr. HATTON BOREOW'S or at any other of his ekilly
obliging relashuns, never to leave the work by day or by night, until he had reelised the dream
of his earlv youth, the object of his matured manhood, and the one fond ope of his advancing
ears, namily the thrilling, the startling, the overwelming discovery of the foot-print of an
ancient Roman Soljer in the beautiful London Clay!
As I wentured to remark to BaowN, after I had suffishently recovered my breth, that
would be about the most hingterestingest diskuvery since Robinson Cruss's discovry of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DRURY LANE TEMPERANCE PLAY;
OR, THE "DROP "-TOO-MUCH DRAMA.
"I'VE only got one night in town, and I want to see something
that occupies the whole evening, with lots of sensation, murders,—
murders, mind!" so said our Friend from the Country, and, conse-
quently, we decided for Drury Lane.
Nothing is wanting. The lover of sensational melodrama cannot
get more for his monev, we should say, anywhere than he can at
Drury Lane. Harry Hastings (Mr. AUGUSTUS HARRIS) is a young
Sailor, whose every utterance is the quint-
essence of courageous virtue, except when
he once bullies a policeman, though, by the

Every Inch a Sailor; or, DC Gus-tibus non disputnndum.
(Irans.—" It's no good having a row with Gus Harris.")
way, the result even here proved that he was quite right in his
estimate of this particular constable's character, as the official was so
completely overawed by the bold Sailor's manner, that, in the most
cowardly style, he turned on an unoffending person in the crowd, and
"ran him in." An unwarrantable arrest that may furnish the sub-
ject for a new drama by Messrs. HARRIS and BUCHANAN.
In the First Act a very wicked Country Squire (Mr. HENRY
GEOBGE) induces a drunken Farmer to murder another but a
younger and less wicked Country Squire (Mr. W. MORGAN), the
cousin of the first Squire, who, thereby, obtains the murdered man's
property ,'and makes love to a remarkably fine young woman, Mary
Morton (Miss HARRIET JAY),
on whom, I regret to say, the
deceased voung Squire had
had ulterior designs the re-
verse of virtuous,—but let
bygones be bygones, poor
younger and less wicked
Squire! de mortuis nil nisi
lonum! When Mr. FERNAN-
DEZ, with a fine display of
anatomical knowledge, gave
him that one stab, with a
clasp-knife, which settled the
young Squire's hash in less
than two seconds, we pitied
him sincerely, and anxiously
looked forward to the last
Act, when,—unless he wasn't
really killed, which was quite
on the cards,—we knew
retribution must overtake the
Very Very Wicked Squire
and Farmer FERNANDEZ, the
latter of whom would by
that time have (as in fact he
did when Act V. came) re-
pented of the sins of his
farmer life. In this Act we are introduced to the.Comic Villain and
a tender-hearted Cabman, capitally played by Mr. H. NICHOLLS and
Mr. H. JACKSON,—Mr. HARRIS'S two HARRIES,—respectively.
"The murder in the First Act isn't bad for a beginning, but I ho^e
they '11 keep it up," says our Friend from the Country, rubbing his
hands and smacking his lips.
The Kind Cabman takes under his protection his black-eyed Fare
Esther (Miss EYRE) with her little child, her " small and early,"—
(son or daughter, we did not hear the sex mentioned, and the costume
at this early age is much the same for both sexes,)—who is the pledge
of the Very Very Wicked Squire's heartless attachment.
ACT II.—Ingeniously-contrived scene. Dynamite factory on one
side, and Cabman's lodging for man and beast on the other. Real
rain descends in buckets. The bold Sailor is caught in it. "Any
port in a storm!" and, having mastered the pass-word, he goes right
in among all the " Black-looking pirates, ugly swabs, and so forth,

who form the club of Dynamite Conspirators, of whom the chief
villain is the Guy Faux, always offering to blow up everything
and everybody. (The
bold Sauor is more
truthful than com-
plimentary—that is
one side of his cha-
racter which he
never loses an oppor-
tunity of exhibiting,
while giving the
audience his full
front as often as
possible—and abuses
these ruffians to their
dirtyfaees. Theylet
him escape pro tern.,
for the sake, not] of
their dynamite plot,
but for the plot of
the Drama, which, at
this point, couldn't
dispense with either
the services of the
bqld'young Sailor, or
with those of the
double-dyed villains.) It is in this Act that we get the first intimation
of its being a temperance drama. Here we have the first drop,—of rain.
The next drop comes between the Acts; and, last of all, is the
"drop too much"—so much too much that the Sailor, who has been
condemned (what a hard life he has had!) for the murder of which
he is innocent, does not take it, but is restored, by means of the
Kind Cabby and his black-eyed Fare, to the arms of his Lass, the
"doosid fine gal," Mary Morton, who might have floored that
whipper-snapper young Squire in the First Act. had she only known
how to give him one-two pugilistically, and finish him. Had she
done this, the second title of the piece might have been, "Mary the
Maid of the Mill." This Act ends by Mr. FERNANDEZ putting
dynamite somewhere near a Police-station (being driven to it—the
deed, not the station—by the Very Very Wicked Squire, not by the
Cabman), and partially blowing up his own daughter, who had done
nothing to deserve it.
"No murder in that Act," says our Country Friend, who has
tasted blood in Act the First, and whose bloodthirstiness is not to be
quenched by a mere dynamite explosion which only shatters glass,
and injures, but doesn't kill, the very fine young woman.." Besides,"
he adds, discontentedly, "where was the Sailor? he ought to have
come in and rescued somebody, or fought one of the villains, or have
been arrested for the 'diabolical attempt.'" No; our Friend didn't
think it was horrible enough, and we too fancied that a chance had

might bo disposed to meddle with dynamite.

Great chance of the whole dramatis persona being swept off at one
blow of the wind. Wrecks and JECKS,—Miss JECKS, we, should say,
who plays the poor little Stowaway, and saves the principal per-
formers. The inoffensive Captain, with whom, as he had only
appeared in two short scenes before, we had scarcely time to scrape
an acquaintance, or appreciate his exact worth, is murdered—
(" That's two!" says my bloodthirsty Friend from the Country,
checking 'em off on his fingers. "Hooray!")—and about six of the
crew, all dynamite villains, are drowned—(That.'s eight 1" says my
sanguinary-minded Friend, delighted)—then the chief dynamiter is

the interest falling off, for
there is no murder: only
an innocent man con-
demned to death.

us time to reflect on the; appropriateness of the
Sailor's name, Harry
Hastings. Who gave him
that name? His god-
fathers, Messrs. BUCHANAN

Quoth he, "In speculation there's a most disastrous lull,
And business in the City is indubitably dull.
"There's nothing doing in the ' House' in any stocks or shares,
And very silent are the ' Bulls,' and angry are the ' Bears';
'Tis no use dealing with ourselves, endeavouring to ' best'
Each other, when the public won't be tempted to invest.
"I 've tried my hand at Mexicans, and sold them in a funk,
And often I 've been in and out of Canada's Grand Trunk;
I 've dabbled in Egyptians,—you don't catch me there again,—
I 've lost in rails American, and burnt my hands with Spain.
"It's no good going on like this, for all men know, I ween,
The proverb says it s bad for Crows to 'pick out Corbies' een;'
We prey upon each other, since the public shows no flats,
And very soon must emulate the famed Kilkenny Cats."
So moaned that poor young Stockbroker in accents sad and sour,
He scarce could cock his glossy hat, he sported ne'er a flower;
And as he wandered West upon his melancholy way,
He hadn't tasted dry champagne through all the weary day.

LATIN "ALL GREEK."
DBAS MR. PUNCH,
I am only a Fifth Form boy, but I want to know what all
this new rubbish is about pronouncing the Latin C like the Greek K.
I sent up some verses this week trying to give HOTTGHTON (that's
our Head-master) a hint. Here they are, Mr. Punch .—
Si K via pro C substituere, quare Kukumber
Non invenire debes semper at Kcesar's Hotel?
Aut pro ludibrio Cicero si qurerit Avernum,

Now, would you believe, Mr. Punch, that for this, which took me
lalf-an-hour with a gradus, I had to go into the library with a rod,
)ecause the Doctor said that "my verses had neither quality nor
quantity to recommend them!" And so I 'm in for it, but remain,

Blest if I don't, before I go to smash
Along of brass bands, 'lectric lights, and the rest of it.
Soles are still two bob a pound, ready cash.
Some comfort in that, hay?
Second Ditto (portentously). Ah! don't make a jest of it,
BuaoiNS, my boy. Think o' stuffed sharks, and squids,
And—eugh! them there devilish long-armed Hoctopuses!
First Ditto. Yah! tickle the Public and frighten the kids,
But what's that to us, so's we pull in the " Mopusses."

First Ditto (exploding). Now, SKINNEM, old man,
'Tisn't pantermine-time. Tell you what, Sir, "the Garden"
Had better engage you.
Second Ditto (thoughtfully). Ah! not a bad plan,
When salmon is down to, we '11 say tuppence farden,
And all us poor Fishmongers out in the cold.
Thanks, BUGGINS, I '11 think of it.
First Ditto (admiringly). Lor! what a feller!
You should start a " Comic." Snakes! how 'twould be sold
In the Trade! "f would make some of them scribblers look
yeller.
They 've writ up " the Fisheries" proper, no doubt,
But for larks they 're not in it with tradesmen like we are.
Second Ditto. Not likely. The Public bamfoozled about
Betwixt Nobs, Scribes, and Salesmen like fish in the sea are
Fair game for the hook and the net, and that's fun,
That's a good bit beyond scribbling wits and joke-jobbers.
First Ditto. They said we was bottled up sure as a gun.
And the public well rid o' such sharks and sea-robbers.
Second Ditto. Ah, yes, that's their lay; heard the whole lot before;
But we 're head upperds yet.
First Ditto (judicially). Well, this 'ere Exhibition,
Has been good for Trade and the Railways. Done more
For amusements than plays. Then those Gardens Elysian,
As ink-spillers call 'em, with Japanese lanterns,
Weren t bad; and the Public seemed happy to wander,
With nets and sea-horrors wherever a man turns.
But as for cheap tish!! I
Second Ditto (scornfully). Why he must be a gander
Whoever expected it.

The wide 'uns as started it made a good purse from it.
As to the poor and fhi-ir share in. the wealth
Of the sea-harvest,—Walker!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TRICKS OF THE LANDING-STAGE.
(The whole Bag of em.)
Bogus Club, New York, 29M Oct., 1883.
ME. PUNCH,—SIB,—Haying seen in your British papers the account,
cabled off at the time to date, of the arrival of I!ENHY J. IEVING.
ELLEN B. TERRY, and the rest of that distinguished intellectual
footlight consignment, I am franking you these lines to tell you that,
from a general desire freely expressed all round to avoid painful
vulgar publicity, it was that delicately garbled, that though con-
siderably on the spot myself that morning, I should not have recog-
nised it in the afternoon sheets •with a twenty-four-inch binocular.
No, Mr. Punch, a two-cent slice of the truth, one-horse quality, is
all that you have yet had of those remarkable proceedings; and
under the circumstances you will, I guess, be glad and grateful to
cast your eye over a few genuine straight-hand notes taken in the
neighbourhood of that there ship Britannic, on that morning in
question by Your watchful and reliable Correspondent,
THE FIRST MAN UP THE SIDE.
• •»»••
3 A.M.—"Woke by heavy firing of harbour batteries. Jumped up
and put my head out. Procession half a mile long, with three brass
bands and five Circus elephants picked out in electric light, passing
quietly along somewhere. Fancy it's COLERIDGE going to bed.
Wrong. IRVING 's in sight. Fly into my clothes, and off to wharf
like a tickled rocket.
• *»»*•
Seventy-five launches starting together. Pushing smart. Water
full of interviewers. The most cursedest crush to get on board, but
manage it, and am off first. Note rival screw creeping up fast.
Explain to Captain that " he may as well bust as get me up along-
side in a back row." That does him. He's on the safety-valve like
apiece of hot butter. Pace improved. Cannot see the other craft.
Hope he's run on to a torpedo. Ha! here's the Britannic! Now,
then. Hullo! what's this? Funnel—spars—bits of the Captain
flying all over the place, and nothing to sit on but five tons of steam!
I do believe she's bust!
• ****•
Yes, she has! Most convenient. Here I am come down on board.
Right in the very midst of all the bosses on the bridge. Shake hands
all round and ask for HENRY K. IRVING and ELLEN J. TERRY. Cap-
tain, a thin, long, gentlemanly looking cuss, with flowing hair and
glasses fixed up on his nose, says something with a white smile, and
beckons a short and stout party, well mustachioed with a dark beard,
to come up and join us. This, then, is the great British tragedian!
Looks like it. Don't see though how he's to collar King Lear with-
out a clean shave. Owing to the seventeen warships in attendance
all playing "Hail, Columbia!" together, can't catch plainly what
the pale Captain says, but think he calls him "JOSEPH." Proper
style then, HENRY JOSEPH IRVING. Make a note of it. Interview
him rapidly. Denies that he has come to the States solely to buy up
tinned oysters. Has never tried to knock BOOTH down flat with a
left-hander, but thinks he could. Wears merino hose in summer
months. Likes artichokes. Believes VANDERBILT could stand a
week's "bearing," and toss the Duke of WESTMINSTER five-dollar bits
to cents with 'vantage coin any time he likes to name afterwards.
Has never tasted devilled walrus. Hopes to take some home with
him. Would go back by land if he could. Thinks SHAKSPEARE
could give the Editor of Tribune five laps in a mile and lick him into
apple shavings. Says the reason he isn't like the published cartes of
HENRY IRVING is because his name is JOSEPH HATTON. Use bad
language and leave him at a bound, in search of ELLEN TERRY.
* * * * * *
Owingto that slipped-in interview with JOSEPH B. HATTON, chance
gone. Every blessed one of the seventy-five launches alongside now.
Interviewers, cheers, guns, Military bands, and floating triumphal
i—loose for miles in every direction. Bead on one, "May
arches-
Heaven bless I'.i; \ n STOKER." Must find him out at any pace,
to be in the engine-room. Down we go.
******
Hullo, here's luck! Miss ELLEN P. TERRY at last! She seems to
be taking tongue sandwiches and porter freely in front of the coal-
bunkers, finding it cold aloft. Looks a fine well-grown woman of
about five-and-forty by the glare. Go at her straight, and ask her
which she finds her biggest part, Beatrice or Juliet. Tells me "to
get along with my nonsense." Turn to a cuss, with a smut-set
face, sniggering by the furnace, for information. Says "she's a
Stewardess." Ask him if he's BRAM STOKER. Says he's stoker.
"but as to BRAM,—not if he knows it." Out of that as quick as I
can, and up the shaft as slick as lubricated lightning.
* * * • • •
After a free fight, and a little handling of my six-shooter, got near
HENRY W. IRVING and ELLEN A. TERRY at last. Take the Lady
first. Cries bitterly when I talk of the rough weather she had after
she got off from Liverpool. When asked whether she thinks she '11
take the shine out of COLERIDGE, says she "rather hopes she will."
Is fond, top, of PEARS'S soap, and thinks if GOULD is put up for the
next Presidency it ought to be more than even betting. Takes
molasses with her tea, and believes BOOTH could play Macbeth on a
bicycle if ho tried hard. Was continuing my questions neatly, but
was here handed backwards through a skylight.
* * * ' * * *
A little damaged, but soon up again, with the assistance of the
saloon-poker. Get nold of HENRY Y. IRVING at last. Went for him
like a cobra on the drink. Here is his examination in full:—
1. Says he thinks he has gained a good deal of flesh on this trip.
2. Is a better sailor in quiet water than most men. (This includes
COLERIDGE.)
3. Says BRAM STOKER is BRAM STOKER, and that's all he 'a got to
say about him.
4. Speaks with a good deal of kindly feeling of JOSEPH B. HATTON.
Says, when he and ABBEY, and a cuss.from the Lotus, and a lot more
he didn't know from ADAM, all came on board together, and fell on his
neck with tears of welcome, all of 'em, "so broke down like a child,"
that you could have heard the sobbing right away at Sandy Hook.
5. Hopes they won't pelt him with dead cats because he wouldn't
play First Gravedigger to BooTH'S-Hamfei down in the London Strand.
6. Doesn't think if the British Ministry come over, with the
Speaker and other properties, that they '11 spoil his business—unless
they get at BRAM STOKER—which is a moral, they won't, not even
with travelling expenses and a per-centage on the National Debt.
7. Finds the interviewing business a nice, pleasant, modest,
retiring high-class sort of work," and perfect top-boots as cheap
advertising.
8. Admits he has brought a pile of sets with him, but not the
Lyceum Stage and the Gaiety Restaurant—as maliciously reported
by COLERIDGE.
******
was about to ask him his opinion on Sea Bathing and Hop
Bitters when at this point I was again handed backwards down
through a skylight, and badly figured with splinters.
8 P.M.—On shore again. Just got the glass out in time to take a
stroll, and pick up a bit more news. Such a crush in Broadway that
I got fixed up in a gutter on] top of some cuss who said he was a bit
of a poet, and wanted " sweetness and light." Gave him five cents
of green corn-candy and a fusee.
»''****•
9 P.M.—Here they are! Skyrockets, firemen, banners, balloons,
Bengal lights, deputations, brass bands, and the whole select scum
out on the full swing! Here they come! HENRY K. IRVTNQ and
ELLEN J. TERRY just landed !i Ask the poet if he '11 let me just step
on his head for five minutes for fifteen dollars. Says he's never let
out his head at sueh a low figure." Ask the cuss his name.
"MATTHEW ARNOLD." Well, I am blest! Pick him up, and get
him quietly to an hotel in a back street, with the help of a few
friends. Says, feebly, he likes "smoky London best." Promise to
come and hear all about it to-morrow. Guess I will, too.
Hullo! Here they come! Down I go. Up again, and behind
BHAM STOKER on a fire-engine.
• *, • • • *
More about what I 've got out of him by next cable.
A Real Cold Place.
"NEGRETTI and ZAMBRA!" exclaimed a Gentleman up from his
charming marine residence at Beaehington. '' NEGRETTI and ZAUBRA!
how cold it has been!"
".Dear me!" observed a friend, "I 'm sorry to hear that. I was
thinking of trying Beaehington in the winter."
'' Beaehington is more likely to try you," was the encouraging reply.
"But," said the friend, "when you have a West wind it must be
delicious."
"West wind!" exclaimed the chilly person. "By ZAMBRA! we
never have a West wind. With us at Beaehington whatyou call the
West wind is only the East wind coming buck again! Ugh!"

MINISTERS IN COUNCIL.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne (after preliminary conversation}. Yes, I assure you, a delightful
trip. TENNYSON in capital form: promised to write a new Idyll of the Czar,
and I'm going to help him!
Sir C. D-lke. I object, on principle, to Czars, of course. Still, excellent
move that, hob-nobbing with Emperors and Kings. Pleased British Public im-
mensely. Pandora can t hold a candle to Pembroke Castle; can it, H-BT-NGT-N?
Lord H-rt-ngt-n. Not a lucifer! But, I say, how about business?
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Ah! quite so. Here beginneth the Fifteenth Chap I
beg pardon! "What I meant to say was, that the first subject for our considera-
tion to-day is, the work for Parliament in the approaching Session. What shall
it be? Now, don't all speak at once!
Sir W-tt-m H-rc-rt. I should be sorry to obtrude my personal views, but
I should like just to remind all you fellows that I spent no end of time last
Session in working up that London Municipal Reform BUI, and
Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n. Don't distress yourself. The Bill's sure to come in useful.
"Worked up" a trifle more, with glue, it would make capital pellets for the
new police revolvers. Not safe to trust 'em with real bullets, you know, H-HC-BT.
Mr. Tr-v-l-n. Talking of bullets reminds me of Ireland. Don't know why
it should, but it does. Should be sorry to press my own views on the Council,
but no doubt we must look for more agitation, as P-BN-LL won't put his thirty-
five thousand in an old stocking, and consequently some fresh Irish measures
All (very heartily). Bother Irish measures!
Sir_ C. D-lke. And I am quite as sorry as anybody else to interrupt the course
of business, but I must say that I rather agree with H-HC-BT about that London
Bill. F-BTH is making life quite unendurable to me about it. Threatens to
denounce me to my constituents (and his) as " A.n Alderman is Disguise." If
London Bill isn't brought in next Session, I anticipate that F-BTH will shoot me
in the back from behind a street-hoarding.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Dear me! what a dangerous person! Quite a Nihilist!
Wonder if he would accept the Chief Justiceship of Sierra Leone? Talking of
Nihilists, the CZAB told me that
Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n. Oh. hang the CZAB! Excuse the expression; but really,
how about business? There's the County Franchise Bill. Shall we take that
next Session, or not?
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Why, of course! Imagine the natural indignation of the
agricultural labourer if this great and glorious privilege is delayed much longer!
Patriotism demands
Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n. So it does, but the question rather
is, what did the Leeds Conference demand?
Lord H-rt-ngt-n. Don't wish to say anything un-
pleasant to CH-MB-BL-N, but surely we oughtn't to yield
to a Caucus Parliament.
Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n. And I should be sorry to hurt H-R-
T-NGT-N'S feelings in any way, but I mast remark that
government by a Caucus Parliament would be preferable
to government by a Whig Oligarchy!
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Come, come! You 're both quite right^
as I have frequently explained, and would now, only I
haven't time. 1 confess I should like to tackle the Corpo-
ration at once. You see they 've cleared for action, and
stationed old FOWLEB on quarter-deck, with his glass
up to his blind eye, to shout that England expects every
Alderman to do nis duty. Should feel real pleasure in
blowing up his magazines for him.
Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n. Then why not take London and
County Franchise for next Session? Nothing like decid-
ing quick. I want to go off to bed. as I 've been sitting
up till four in the morning all through the Recess, appoint-
ing Bankruptcy Receivers. Thousands of applications.
Didn't know how to choose. Tried it by algebra at first,
but have taken now to shuffling up names in an old hat.
Saves no end of time. Then shall we say it's all settled?
Mr. Gl-dst-ne (thoughtfully). It has been suggested that
a Redistribution of Seats Bill would easily wait till 1885.
The Electoral Balance of Power must not be too rashly
disturbed. Talking of the Balance of Power, the opinion
of the CZAB
Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n (rudely interrupting). Who cares a
screw for the CZAB? Not I. Tell you what it is,
GL-DST-NE; you've forgotten the chief argument for
taking Redistribution of Seats at once.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. What's that?
Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n. Why, how about Woodstock and
EyeP They'd be disfranchised, and then, "exeunt"
RANDOLPH and ASHMEAD!
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Why, it's the Millennium! But I
almost hesitate. We are Patriots first, and Liberals
afterwards, and what would the British Empire do
without ASHMEAD? The CZAB told me
All. Quite so—but suppose we adjourn the discussion
for a week? [Council adjournad accordingly.

"THE ONLY ONE."
WE tremble when we read
the following in the Daily
Telegraph:—
AS GENERAL. — Neat in
dress, respectful manners,
willing and obliging. Seven years'
personal character. Disengaged
end of present month.
Is he tired of fame and
honour? Does he sigh for
other worlds to conquer? Is
he bored with the adulation
of the Press? Will our Only
General desert us after all we
have done for him? Will he
leave the Soldier's Pocketbook
to command our Army? Let
us weepj let us howl, let us—
hope it is not true!
DISTANT RELATIONS,—Mem-
bers of the Alpine Club may
have been interested by the
information recently tele-
graphed from .Calcutta that
Mr. GRAHAM and his Swiss
grades had returned to Dar-
jeeling from a survey whereof
the conclusion is, that he pro-
nounces the ascent of Kinch-
injunga from the South impos-
sible. The Kinchinjunga seems
to be no very small child. Are
the Kinchinjunga and Jung-
f ran to be regarded as moun-
tain-cousins only some degrees
removed?
NEW LATIN SPELLING.—The
Dean of Banjror would substi-
tute for "Te Duce" the fol-
lowing "Tea Deuce, eh?"
The Dean says that, as far as
he is concerned, tea should
remain in its own chest, and
be " Unurned Increment."

strange things. The follow-
ing appears in the Daily Tele-

A BACHELOR, professional,
would like to meet with
cheerful and Christian society,
where an hour in the evening
could be spent in reading, con-
versational German, or otherwise.
This is IIOHU file. Highest re-
ferences.
Now we have heard of a
"confirmed bachelor," but
surely a " professional bache-
lor " is something new. Pos-
sibly he is artful, and, when
he gets into "cheerful and
Christian society," fails to
practise what he professes,
steals away the heart of some
young maiden, and gets the
promise of her hand, when
the parents all the while
thouglit him to be the most
harmless of men. What, too.
does "or otherwise" mean?
It might comprise a great deal.
Carpet dances, pleasant sup-
pers, and flirtation in the con-
servatory. We are afraid
this "professional bachelor"
is a sly dog.
AT the opening of the New
York Metropolitan Opera
House, Madame NILSSON was
presented with a golden girdle.
A lot of money was spent on
it, but there was very little
waist. But why a girdle?
Was it to remind her of the
brilliant dress circle that wit-
nessed her performance on the
occasion. The Ancient Ma-
riner, with his glittering eye-
Lord COLERIDGE, Our Only
Lord Chief Justice, was pre-
sent. Poor MAPLESON! he nad
a poor show that same night!
ANOTHER LITTLE HOLIDAY CRUISE.
Aicay from Lake Scavnig—Practical Joke at Loch Hourn—On
again—Craylet/'t Practice—Making for Kyle Aikin.
One of CRATLET'S idiosyncrasies — idiosyncrasies soon become
palpable on board a yacht—is to be quite delighted at having bought
anything cheap. He has purchased during the voyage (before our
appearance on board) a box of Jersey cigars, one hundred for nine
shillings. He says that they are really very good; in fact, he prefers
them to anything he has ever smoked (he deals in superlatives) at
five times their price. He is most open-hearted with these treasures,
pressing his host and ourselves to "just try one," but somehow we
all seem to shrink from availing ourselves of his lavish generosity.
Our host, who is so courteously good-natured that he would rather
risk an irreparable injury to his constitution than seem by his refusal
to imply a slight on his friend's perfect taste and judgment as evinced
in his predilection for these Jersey Favourites, pretends to change
his mind, and asks CRAYLEY, in a way that makes it quite a favour
on CRAYLET'S part, to give him one; which, of course, CRAYLEY does
with the greatest possible pleasure. The Jersey Favourite is a trifle
recalcitrant on being lighted, and shows an inclination for burning on
one side, with a dirty-coloured crumbling ash. The conversation,
whatever it was about (Dr. JOHNSON, I think), continues, but I
notice that, within five minutes of the first lighting of that Jersey
Favourite, our host has risen to look out of the port-hole to see what the
weather is like, and has then, avowedly with the same object, gone up
"the companion," and when he returns, with a hopeful report of the
weather,—which is immediately dissipated by a sudden downpour,
and a derisive howling of the wind.—the Jersey Favourite (the cigar
merchant ought to have labelled them the Lilies, or the L-gtriesT is
burnt down to a stump, which our host places in the ash-tray. It
is impossible to smoke in the wind," he says, and somehow or other
he skilfully manages not to give any decided opinion on the cigar; at
all events, he has committed himself to nothing which can hurt
CRAYLEY'S feelings (we are all so tetchy about wine, cigars, and
horses), and as he has smoked it, CRAYLEY, if he asks no questions,
can afterwards quote MELLEVILLE (who is really a good judge of most
things) as having smoked one of these, and liked it;—the logical
inference being from his having smoked it that he did like it.
CRAYLEY regrets not having bought five or six boxes of the Jersey
Favourites. KILLICK observes that he's deuced glad, for the sake
of his friends, he didn't, but MELLEVILLE, who occasionally visits
CRAYLEY at Crayley Court, Kent, only smiles, and saying dubiously,
"Ah, well!" retires drowsily to the saloon sofa.
After a despairing glance upwards at the skylight on which the
rain is still cascading and cataracting, we compose ourselves to
sleep, with books in our hands, and our legs up on chairs. I take my
scientific work to my own cabin, and retire till a cessation of rain
numbers of magazines, and a Spectator which I ought to have read
a fortnight ago. but which, having been packed up by mistake,
comes in quite fresh now, and with these and my note-books and my
pencil all within my reach, so that I shall not have to disturb my-

self when I have once settled down comfortably, I prepare to spend
so much of the afternoon as may remain between now and dinner-time.
We give the weather another chance, which is returning good for
evil, and determine to leave the " Avernus of the North," whatever
happens, to-morrow morning.
The weather takes our courteous treatment into consideration, and
limiting itself to a Scotch mist to begin with, but a real fine day and
a pleasant breeze to finish with, away we go, "a-sailing, a-sailing"
—and thoroughly enjoying the poetry of motion.
»«»»••
We sail by Loch Nevis, Annadale. and arrive at Loch Hourn.
where, after a consultation between the Commodore, the Pilot, and
the Captain, we anchor. In this part, at the entrance of the Loch,
there is a good practical joke played by some one who has placed a
stick with a square piece of something on it (which may be a notice-
board when you get close enough to it), on the top of a submerged
rock. The humour of this is, that in broad daylight it is scarcely
visible, in twilight it may be just discerned with a strong glass when
you are unpleasantly near it. and at night it can't be seen at all. Of
course, the practical fun of this is evident.
******
KILLICK and CBAYLEY, who has developed a wonderful faculty for
flat contradiction, have a lively argument as to the meaning of
"Scavaig." It commences by CRAYLEY informing the company
generally that Loch Nevis is Lake Heaven.
KLLLICK says he knew this, and caps it by telling us that Loch
Hourn is just the opposite.
Then I ask. if the guide-books call Loch Scavaig the Avernus of
the North, what is the meaning of Soavaig?
KILLICK thinks that it must mean something gloomy.
MELLEVTLLE observes, marginally,." probably."
CEAYLEY thinks it is the old Scotch for " Witch."
"Gaelic," says KILLICK, majestically.
"No; not Gaelic," returns CBAYLEY. "They don't speak Gaelic
here."
"They did!" retorts KILLICK, shortly.
"They did nothing of the sort," answers CEAYLEY, with his head
well on one side, his glass screwed in his eye, his face turned away
from KILLICK, and towards Loch Nevis.
"Oh, certainly!" remarks our Commodore, intervening with per-
suasive gentleness. "They certainly spoke Gaelic in these parts.
Soavaig, ATevis, and Hourn are all Gaelic names.'"
"Armadale isn't," says CEAYLEY, not thoroughly convinced.
This is my opportunity. I am not well up in Gaelic, but now I
feel my feet. "Armadale," I say, cleverly, " was a novel. Was it
a story about this locality?"
Nobody is positive on this point; ergo, I suppose no one has read
it. I haven't.
KILLICK remembers it in the Cornhill Magazine. "By WILKIE
COLLINS," he adds, as if he had only read the title, and stopped
there. There are some people with great reputations for reading
everything who never do more than this, and manage to pick up the
chief points in the course of conversation.
"It wasn't written by WILKIE COLLINS!" replies CBAYLEY, curtly.
He evidently owes KILLICK one for the latter's recent victory on
the Gae'lie dispute.
"It was!" retorts KILLICK, sharply.
"Nonsense," says CBAYLEY. "It was Mrs. WOOD."
"Oh! I don't think it was Mrs. WOOD," 1 say, "because she has
a magazine of her own, and why should she write in the Cornhill?"
Having given this piece of logical reasoning, it occurs to me that
Mrs. WOOD hasn't a magazine of her own; but keep the doubt to
myself.
"Armadale was by Mrs. WOOD or Miss BBADDON," says CEAYLEY,
returning to the subject. "Wasn't it?" he asks, appealing to our
Commodore.
But MELLEVILLE will not commit himself to an opinion. He
remembers that Armadale was the name of a novel; nothing more.
This neutrality decides CEAYLEY, and he bears down on KILLICK
with all his guns.
"Of course," he says, decidedly, as if he had just that instant
received private and positive intelligence from indisputable authority.
"Of course Armadale was by Mrs. WOOD or Miss BBOUOHTON, and,
at all events, it certainly was not by WILKIE COLLINS."
"I'11 bet you anything you like," says KLLLICK, warmly, "that
Armadale was by WILKIE COLLINS. I'll bet you five pounds.
Come!"
But CEAYLEY won't "come." He simply replies, with a superb
contempt for KILLICK'S offer, "I never bet," which provokes KILLICK
into extravagant offers to back his own opinion, at twenty to one,
thirty to one, fifty to one, anything, in fact, to one, that WIT.KIE
COT,T,INS did write Armadale. But CEAYLEY preserves a disdainful
silence, which so irritates KTLLICK that he says, " My dear fellow,"—
he is only affectionate when he means quite the contrary, for if his
"My dear fellow" were translated, it would be literally, "You d—
(nottfear) fool (not fellow),"—" My dear fellow, you can't be certain,
or you would back your opinion."
I never bet," repeats the inperturbable CEAYLEY, still with his
head on one side, his glass firmly screwed in his eye, and his gaze
fiercely fixed on the opposite coast. He reminds me of EDGAE ALLAN
POE'S wearying Raven, with its constant "Never more!" KILLICK
would have thrown his boots at that raven, and broken the bust of
Pallas Athene over the Poet's door. As it is, if he could chuck
CEAYLEY quietly into the water, he would do so; and, as the latter
was sinking, he would ask him savagely, "Now, did WLLKIE COLLINS
write Armadale or not ?" _ to which CEAYLEY, rising for the third
time, with the glass in his eye, and his head on one side gazing
upwards, would serenely reply, "I never bet," and disappear
for ever.
Our Commodore goes below; so do I; and KILLICK crosses over to
the other side of the vessel.
Now, though at the commencement of this discussion I knew per-
fectly well, without having read the novel in question, who was the
Author of Armadalej yet now I own to being a bit shaken by the
decided tone and positive manner of CHAYLEY. Positiveness is nine
points of the law, if you happen to be "laying it down."
"Dinner is under weigh, Sir," cries the Merry Young Steward,
and we descend silently.
******
We all meet at dinner as happily as possible, and hear no more of
Armadale.
CBAYLEY and KILLICK avoid discussion. It is a truce between
them; but when they recommence, the contest will be frightful.
As neither MELLEVILLE nor myself will dispute with him, CEAYLEY
starts a new method and argues with himself. He contradicts him-
self flatly, and finally brings himself as holding Opinion No. 1, over
to the side of himself as representing Opinion No. 2, or he tries to
bring one of us into this dual discussion. But as to cut in on such
delicate ground would be like interfering between man and wife, we
wisely hold aloof, and express no opinion either way.
For example, he takes up a telescope, and, after a careful survey
of the distant snores, he says, "There's a castle there. A splendid
ruin." Then he hands the glass to me, and I agree with him,
in much the same spirit as the old courtier Potonius did with
Samlet as to the camel-shaped cloud which was backed like a weasel
and very like a whale. But this does not content HAMLET-CBAYLEY.
He looks at the object again, and then, in a voice which is quite loud
enough for any bystander to catch and reply to (it is a bait thrown
out to KILLICK, who won't bite,—or bark either, now), he says to
himself, "No, it isn't a castle; it's a rock."
He turns to offer me the glass, but as I am with Clarissa Harlowe
in Bloomsbury, and cannot be disturbed, and as MELLEVILLE and
KLLLICK have gone below, he applies the telescope once more to
his eye. and continues the argument entirely with himself.
"Yes," he says, "it is a castle "—then, the next minute, he meets
this statement with the flat and rude contradiction, "No, it isn't."
Then he treats himself in the most cavalier manner, and quite
turns up his nose at the idea of anyone ever having been so absurd
as to think that eccentric-looking rock a castle. And here it would
end, but that he takes one more look through the glass, which
results in his saying positively, "Yes, it is a castle: I thought so
from the first"—which concludes the controversy. It is a harmless
amusement, and, so to speak, keeps his hand in for when he shall
have a real opponent to contradict.
We are now making for Kyle Aikin, and that is my last point
before Strome Ferry.
Gold Leaf from Goldsmith.
HEBE is a cap to fit some of 'em nowadays:—
"To be known in this town was almost synonymous with being on the road
to fortune. How many little things do w« see, without merit or without
friends, push themselves forward into public notice, and by self-advertising
attract the attention of the day: the wise despise them, but the public are
not all wise. Thus they succeed, rise upon the wing of folly or of fashion,
and by their success give a new sanction to effrontery."
This is from OLTVEE GOLDSMITH'S Life of Beau Nash. O sweet
OLIVEE! 0 .brave OLIVEE! Who would have thought that Beau
broke one hundred and twenty years ago. Some of the advertisers of
our day might take this to heart, that "all is not GoLD[8MriH] that
glitters!"
A COXSEBVATTVE Solicitor in the country refused to subscribe to a
Luther Commemoration Fund on the ground that, first of all, Luther
started a Reform Bill, and, secondly, that had he been alive now he
would have come under the Corrupt Practices Act for allowing two
wives at the same time to an Elector. [Surely; this "Permissive
Bill" of Dr. MAEIDT'S was a questionable blessing to the Elector,
specially if there were two Mothers-in-law. Eh ?]

A BROWNE STUDY IN NEW BOND STREET.
A CHILL-BLOODED, youth-forgetting creature must be he who can
walk round the collection of PHIZ'S" Pictures now on exhibition
at the Fine Art Society's Rooms in New Bond .Street, in a simply
critical Lessing's-Laocoon-like spirit.
"I am nothing if not uncritical!" one is tempted to exclaim as
soon as the familiar scrawly signature and unmistakable "touch"
bring back memories of bygone boyish enthusiasms, school-day
side-splittings, the happy periodical anticipations of significant
"announcements," and the pleasant monthly promise of graphic
green covers. Naturalistic elaboration? What did we care about
it then, in the presence of sketchy, but infinitely suggestive. "go "?
"Technique"? Who bothered about technique in boyhoods breezy
hour, when fun and fancy and careless grace were the charms we
chiefly cared for—and always found—in our favourite? These were
pictures, our pictures, the pictures. MICHAEL ANGELO might be
more massive, Mr. BURNE-JONES may be more intense; but this is
"_PHiz." Not HABLOT KNIGHT BROWNE! That might do for
visiting-card, catalogue, or biographical dictionary—not for us. To
us he was "PHIZ " tout court, or. more affectionately, "dear old
PHIZ." He drew Pickwick, and Pecksniff, and Sam Weller, and
Micawber, and Dick Swiveller, and Qutlp, and Little Nell, and
these were sufficient Art Credentials for the youth of pre-Rossettian
Philistia.
And now? Well " PHIZ "is "PHIZ " still—a " PHIZ" that has
not lost sparkle. We see him here in the old familiar shapes, and
in some new and unsuspected ones. We find that the old charm
remains. We find, too, that he will stand the test of a genial and
unpedantic criticism, if we care to apply it. He may not " draw"
as accurately as some heavily conscientious modern Artists. But' he
can " design" better. His abounding wealth of humorous fanciful
invention are a good set-off against their carefuller finish. What
fine free fun! WTiat sharp characterisation 1 What spontaneous
grace! What frolic phantasy! What weird impressiveness!
Sketchy? Of course. But do the self-belauded " Impressionistet"
hit a character, or suggest a landscape with such rapid felicity?
Limited range? Equally, of course. Every Artist's range is limited.
"Pfliz" could not draw Venuses and Cupids, perhaps. Neither
could FLAXMAN draw Cuttles and Quilps. But "Pmz" could do
more than sketch light comicalities and laughable caricatures. He
was fertile of symbolical fancy, and had a feeling for the graceful,
the dramatically impressive in composition, the grotesque in in-
congruity, the tragic in antithesis, the whimsical and weird in land-
scape. A lightly-sketched crowd of fine fantastic Ariel-and-Puck-
like creations show more power and fertility than one correctly
modelled and carefully stippled, but woodenly lifeless Cherub.
Some of "PHIZ'S" wonder-witched scenes were, in conception,
almost worthy of EDGAR ALLAN POB, if in execution many a duller
draughtsman might have surpassed, him. That he had powers of
imaginative and dramatic design only partially developed seems to
be indicated by such pictures as "'Les Trois Vifs et let Trots Moris"
(No. 81), " Sintram and Death descending into the Dark Valley"
(No. 128), "Death's Revel" (No. 121), and many a smaller subject.
Look at the humorous pathos in "Labour in Vain" (No. 64), the
honest rollicking fun in the set of Hunting Bits (Nos. 99 to 111),
belonging to Major JAY—lucky Major!—the comical suggest!veness
of "Mourning tn all Ages" (Nos. 148 to 160), and "A Hint to
Schoolboys with a Sirchy Master" (No. 112), the quaint feeling of
"Gone (No. 46), the " go" of the Irish and. sporting subjects, the
fluent grace of many a light figure or landscape croquis. and admit that
our old favourite had range as well as raciness. Often thin and skimpy,
sometimes simpering and conventional, when out of his element
amidst fine Society figments or pseudo-classic abstractions. Granted.
But the man who could illustrate DICKENS and LEVER as he illus-
trated them, and paint the unelaborated, but harmonious and impres-
sive " Les Trois Vifs et les Trois Marts," fetched a considerable
compass in Art, and deserves more of the good things that partial
fondness is eager to say for him than perhaps finical Critics may be
ready to admit.
Anyhow, " Go and see the ' PHIZ' Gallery," is our advice to genial
Middle-age with memories, and unpriggish Youth without hyper-
ffisthetic prejudices. Mr. Punch rather pities the party, man or bov,
who cannot spend a pleasant hour with the relics of "dear old
'PHIZ,'" at 148, New Bond Street.
WHY ?—" Why should London wait?" asks the Daily Telggraph.

CAN you get freedom from care at Brigh-

MOTHER, requiring freedom from care,
asks for fortnight near New Pier at Brigh-
ton; will someone kindly give it, advertiser being
unable to afford it. All letters answered.
Beyond the railway fare, a fortnight near
the New Pier could scarcely be very expen-
sive; but possibly the police might object to
"MOTHER" hanging about there for so long
a period, and if she stopped out all night,
she might possibly catch cold. Possibly she
means comfortable apartments in the King's
Road, first floor, biff bow-window, hot
luncheon at two, choice dinner at eight,
and a smart Victoria and pair to go out
a-driving.
Who longed so much for change of air,
Who wished to be quite free from care,
Who hadn't too much cash to spare ?—
Why, "MOTHER"!
Who 'd like to spend a fortnight near
The Bedford or the nice New Pier,
In quarters free, with rare good cheer ?—
Why, "MOTHER"!
It is a pity that " MOTHER " did not give

COUNTER CRITICISM.
REFERRING to the Annual Meeting of the Hogarth Club, held a
few evenings since, a contemporary states that it has received the
subjoined communication from a Correspondent present on the
occasion:—
"' I was standing,' says the gentleman in question, ' at the buffet, when I
suddenly heard the voice of Mr. OSCAR WILDE discussing with Mr. WHISTLER
and others the attributes of two well-known actresses. The criticism is at
least expressire. "SARAH BERNHARDT," he said, "is all moonlight and
sunlight combined, exceedingly terrible, magnificently glorious. Miss
ANDERSON is pure and fearless us a mountain daisy. Full of change as a
river. Tender, fresh, sparkling, brilliant, superb, placid." '"
That such sort of criticism is, as the Correspondent truly observes,
"at least expressive " cannot for a moment be denied, but in what
intelligent manner, or with what distinct result, is perhaps not quite
so evident.
Still, as there are some who acknowledge an indefinite sort of
charm in the meaningless mash up of empty adjectives, and inconse-
quent antitheses, that is the leading characteristic of such " criticism"
is the above, the process mig^ht with advantage be extended to other
and equally deserving notabilities. Indeed, a species of brief hand-
book to character might be essayed on such lines with much success.
Take, for instance, a few names at random:—
Mr. BRIGHT might be said to be "solid and psychological as a
Bath-bun. Diversified and full of surprises as a lobster-salad.
Tasty, indigestible, elegant, peppery, fragrant, settling."
Or Lord SALISBURY might be disposed of as " all night-light and
squib-light rolled into one, terribly humorous, magnificently uncon-
scious." While
Mr. OSCAR WILDE himself could figure fairly enough under the
involved image of "trembling as an apple-dumpling. Rash as
cheap hair-oil, flaccid, futile, finished, scholastic, scented sixpence
a bottle."
But there is no occasion to continue a list the value of which, if
completed, would, as a psychological and social guide, be obvious.
Mr. OSCAK WILDE and Mr. WHISTLER should lose no time, but meet
again and again at buffet after buffet, accompanied by a shorthand-
writer and an enterprising publisher or two, and, before the month
was out at the refreshment-bar, the thing would be done.
THE "ORIENTAL EXPRESS" LUXURY.—The Times Correspondent,
who seems to have been a nervous traveller for "A Special, records
"that the motion (of the train) was so smooth, that the people could
shave throughout the journey." What a cheerful, though after a
time monotonous, amusement! He should have signed himself.
'A YOUNG SHAVER." And then his description of the dinner!
Rubies of red wine, and topazes of ditto!" What sort of beverage
is the latter? And is " topazes" a misprint for " Topers " P After
many of these toperses of dittos and red rubies, there couldn't be
much more steady shaving except by a very old hand. We drink
the Special Traveller's health in a glass of Double Ditto!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SPEAKER.
(A Handbook to Ready-made Oratory.)
PABT III.—MUNICIPAL TOASTS.
THE position of a Provincial Mayor is less peculiar than that of
"the Chief Magistrate of the City of London." As a rule, the
country magnate has "been ibefore his public " for many years as
an Alderman before TnalHnp his first appearance as the head of the
Municipality. The transition from Alderman to Mayor is easy and
gradual. It makes very little difference to anyone, save, perhaps, to
the reporter of the local paper, who has to remember the distinction
between the two grades. But in London the change is magical.
Before the 9th of November the Lord Mayor Elect is scarcely known.
He has been, and will, after three hundred and sixty-five days of
office, become once more, a simple Alderman. Sometimes, a very
simple Alderman. His name will be mentioned with an apologetic
smile by the vast majority of those who know him when he is not
residing at the Mansion House, but during his tenancy of that
desirable residence, he will be accepted as a somebody—a rather
ridiculous somebody—but still a somebody. For one whole year he
will be Host in General to the Metropolis of the World. He will have
to entertain Bishops, Statesmen, Scientists, and Royalties. Nay. it
is possible that he may have to welcome to his honest but not humble
house Sovereigns, and even the very Majesty of England itself. Any
letter he addresses to the papers (especially during the earlier months
of his reign) will be honoured with large type, and all his speeches
will be given in full. His great object should be to defend the raison
d'etre of his office. It should be his task in proposing the health of
such-and-such a celebrity, to trace the connection between the City
and the City's guest, and to lead up to the reply. If not particularly
interesting in itself, his speech should be the cause of interest in the
speeches made by others. Much latitude is permitted him in pro-
nunciation. He may take as a golden rule the line, "Look after the
thoughts and sentiments, and allow the aspirates to look after them-
selves." He must mind his "ps" and "qs," but need not keep a
severe watch over his "hs." No one expects the Lord Mayor of
London to be a devoted student of the laws laid down by the late
LDTDLEY MUEEAY. Occasionally a "Chief Magistrate" is found to
be thoroughly well-educated. The present LOBD MATCH Elect, for
instance, is an example of this exception to the general rule, and one
of his colleagues, too-who has not passed the' Chair, is actually a
Master of Arts of the University of Cambridge. But these cases must
be regarded as rather startling innovations. And startling innova-
tions are never very popular in the Guildhall.
The great occasion for Civic oratory is unquestionably the 9th of
November, when the intellect of the nation is gathered together to
eat turtle-soup, funder the shadows of Gog and Magog, within a
stone's throw of Cheapside. It is then that the ears of the Press and the
eyes of the nation are most concerned with "his Lordship." He has
a very difficult part to play, especially if he happens to be a Member
of Parliament, and belongs to the party languishing on the Oppo-
sition Benches. The loyal toasts, of course, wfll give Him no trouble.
He will say the conventional things in the conventional manner, and
receive the conventional applause. It is when he has to propose the
Army and Navy, the Houses of Lords and Commons, and especially
"Her Majesty's Ministers" that his real troubles will surround him.
He must be dignified and conciliatory, and yet have the courage of
his principles. He must not be frightened at the PREMIER'S uniform,
and when the costume of a more than usually gorgeous Ambassador
attracts his attention, he must regain his composure by a glance at
the magnificent toilette of the City Marshal. He must bear in mind
that he is supported by the City Trumpeters, who, in case of need,
will be able to put down opposition by clamour. Thug reassured, he
should pass through the ordeal successfully. To assist "his Lord-
ship," this Guide (which is nothing if not practical) contains a few
suggestions for dealing with the various toasts that have to be given
from the Chair on the 9th of November. It will be seen that the
leading idea is to give the "local colouring" of the City to every
proposition. Here then f olloweth—
Hints for Speeches to be made by the Lord Mayor at his "Call Dinner."
"Army, Navy, and Volunteers."—Introduce allusion to the City
Train Bands. Give briefly history of WAT TYLER, laying stress upon
the incident of his death at the hands of a Lord Mayor of the Period.
Refer to the love of past Chief Magistrates for excursions on .the
Thames. "Should the nation be really in danger, the City Barge
would he manned by the Watermen, ready to expel the foreign
intruder!" London Militia has for its Colonel Sir REGINALD HANSON,
Master of Arts of the University of Cambridge. The Lady Mayoress
is fond of giving away prizes to the City "Volunteers. Conclude by
saying that "NAPOLEON BONAPARTE, referring to the great com-
mercial interests of the City of London, called the English a 'nation
of shopkeepers'—for all that the Battle of Waterloo was won by
British pluck and British bayonets!"
"House of Lords."—A Tory Lord Mayor will, of course, speak of
this institution with much respect. Mr. ALDERMAN FOWLER no doubt
will refer with approval to the suggestion of his predecessor that the
Chamber of Peers and the Court of Aldermen are very much alike—
especially the Court of Aldermen.
House of Commons."—His Lordship will apologise for theshort-
comings of the popular assembly. "As a Memberhimself," he will
probably furnish autobiographical reminiscences. Each reminiscence
may commence with '' I remember on one occasion in the House, when
I was talking to a Statesman who before now has enjoyed the confi-
dence of Her.MAjESTY, that," and then will follow the story.
"Her Majesty's Ministers."—He will say that "politics are not
admissible at a gathering such as this." Having laid down this rule,
he will proceed to break it. He will call attention to the rumours
("he hopes groundless") that the privileges of the City are about
to be invaded. Then he will quote more history about WAT TYLER,
GEESHAM, the City Train Bands, and the recent opening of Burnham
Beeches to the People for ever. He will give a "nasty one" to the
HOME SECEETAEY. He will probably have something to say about
the late Lord BEACONSFIELD and his foreign policy. The connection
between the City and Ireland will possibly furnish a subject upon
which to hang some pleasant saying about the Government and the
present condition of the Emerald Isle. He will conclude by making
the discovery that after all (in "spite of all temptations ") Liberals
and Conservatives, Whigs and Tones, are yet Englishmen, and may
be expected " to behave as such." This last sentiment will_be the
concession that a host feels bound to yield to a guest. He will sug-
gest that although the members of the present Government are rather
partial to wallowing in blood and mud, they have one great redeem-
mgpoint—they are fond of City turtle!
Having disposed of these toasts and received snubbings, more or
less pronounced, from the FOEEION SECRETARY, the Marquis of
HARTIKGTON, and Mr. GLADSTONE, he may " rest and be thankful."
If necessity arises, he will patronise the Ambassadors, because the
City is wealthy, the LORD CHANCELLOR, because he is himself "the
Chief Magistrate of the First City of the Universe," and the ancient
seats of learning, because " amongst the Aldermen is a Master of Arts
of the University of Cambridge." During his year of office he will say
something civil to the Judges, because he presides at the Central
Criminal Court, to the Bishops, because the daughter of a Lord
Mayor is occasionally married in St. Paul's Cathedral, to the Fellows
of the Royal Society, because telephones are now in general use in
the neighbourhood of the Mansion House. When he attends
the Royal Academy Banquet he will, of course, call attention
to the fact that the City Authorities frequently purchase pictures.
Before now, "Literature" has been entertained in the Mansion
House. Should the Authors be asked to the Egyptian Hall in 1884,
no doubt his Lordship will refer to the Free Library near the Mayor's
Court, and say something really nice about the marketable value of
brains in the Nineteenth Century. He may even admit (if in a very
good humour) that brilliant thoughts are nearly as precious as grey
shirtings. Again, there is a precedent for Actors going East of
Temple Bar. If they make this journey during the next twelve
months, the Lord Mayor will very likely express himself as quite
pleased with some of the works of the late WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE.
To sum up. For a year his Lordship will have the privilege of
patronising everybody and everything. He will be listened to during
this time with patience, if not respect. When, however, the regula-
tion reign expires, he will disappear into the ranks, and become once
more an ordinary individual, whose oratory will be most suitable to
a local vestry.
GUT FENIAN.
OH. PITT the poor Fenian who has tried to wreck a train,
Or blow a public building up with dynamite in vain;
He has wasted his materials, not created much alarm,
Done anything or anyone but very little harm,
Except himself; for haply the Police are on the track:
And then he's like to Reynard with the hounds behind his back.
If a oonspirer, Feeny stands within Law's long-armed reach;
'Tis probable some one of his accomplices will peach.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WHAT I SAW AND HEARD AT THE FISHERIES
EXHIBITION.
I HEABD a magnificent-looking fellow, who stood about six feet in
his stockings, and a little more without them, and who probably
weighed about fifteen stone, state publicly that he was one of fiye-
and-thirty Pilots of Swansea, of whom five-and-twenty, including
himself, wore tiie blue ribbon of temperance. In the bitterest
winter's night, in the wildest storm of hail, rain, or snow, they
tasted nothing stronger than tea or coffee, giving greatly the prefer-
ence to tea. They also highly appreciated the great staying powers
—to use a sporting phrase—of cocoa, and wished it were more gene-
rally used on board ship.
I saw a member of the Court of Common Council (pointed out to
me by ROBERT the Waiter), about lunch-time, pensively gazing upon
four different specimens of Turtle, exhibited in the Spanish Court.
There seemed a puzzled look in his concentrated gaze, as if he were
saying, "Four kinds of Turtle? How can that be? Thick .Turtle
I know, and clear Turtle I know, but what are the others P"
I heard a weather-beaten Fisherman tell, in his own homely and
unadorned fashion, how he had spent thirty successive winters at
sea; how he had seen four vessels, out of the fishing-fleet of which
he was in command, go down with every soul on board; how, in one
fearful night in October^ 1881, eleven smacks went down with all
hands, numbering fifty-nve souls, and, on another occasion, twelve
smacks and ninety-six men went down into the pitiless deep, and not
one escaped to tell the sad story; how, during his thirty years of sea-
life, he had seen hundreds of men drowned, and why? because the
boats were not big enough, and not strong enough, being only some
80 or 90 tons. He had never known a boat of 150 tons lost.
Fear is a word unknown to Fishermen! They never care how high
the sea runs, or how fierce the wind blows, provided they have plenty
of sea-room and—no company!
I saw the gracious Lady whom all .Fishermen ought to, and pro-
bably do, regard with affectionate gratitude—considering what she
has done for the poor Fishermen of Baltimore and Cape Clear, how
she has raised them, by her .wisely-directed liberality, from poverty
and misery and occasional pauperism, to prosperity ana independence
—listening with eyes as well as ears to tne graphic account given by
an eager enthusiast, how he had settled down in a poverty-stricken
district in Ireland, where, as he said, the young men were going
about wearing half a shirt and half a pair of trousers, and how he
established a pottery there, and brought over Englishmen to instruct
them, and how they were now clothed in broadcloth and linen, and
earning from fifty to sixty shillings a week each. I think, from the
delighted look of Lady BmtDETT-CouTTS, she would have liked to
have shaken hands with that enthusiastic and successful worker in
the good cause she has so much at heart.
I heard a fine intelligent fellow describe, without a word of boast-
fulness, how he hod raised himself from being only a poor Fisher-
man to be Manager of a Fishing Fleet, and I heard him use these
remarkable words, "My increased knowledge increases the know-
ledge of my own ignorance." What Fishermen want, he said, is
more education, more intelligence, and less rashness; there will then
be less loss of life. Nothing will induce them to wear life-belts.
Why? Because, though fearless of danger, they dread anything like
chaff. Ridicule is worse than rocks or wrecks, in their opinion.
No man spoke at this wonderful meeting unless he had something
to say- he said it as briefly, as earnestly, and yet as quietly as
he could, and, having said it, he resumed his seat. Let anyone
endeavour to picture to himself what our boasted House of Commons
would be, if they would condescend to stoop from their high estate
and imitate these poor, but earnest Fishermen. Fancy a debate in
that honourable House without waste of time, or vain repetition, or
denunciation, or boredom, or noise. The Chairman (Mr. BIBKBEOK,
M.P.) must have been as much surprised as delighted at the unusual
form of the discussion over which he so ably presided.
I afterwards saw a distinguished member of the Corporation
taking a farewell sixpenny dinner on the closing day.
AN OUTSIDER.
MBS. I a MM.io-1 ii AM is evidently working up the lAfe of Lwther, so
as to be up to the time of day for the Tercentenary. She says she
saw a note from a Correspondent to ourselves, last week, stating that
LUTHEH gave permission to an Elector to have two wives anonymously,
but her niece LAVINIA has been reading to her the correct version of
the affair, and (she informs us) it wasn't an Elector at all, but a
German Landmark to whom the permission was granted. (Mrs.
KAMSBOTHAH is very nearly right; so was our Correspondent.)
MORE FROM THE GOLDSMITH BIRTHDAY-BOOK.
WE had just been reading once more in the Times its periodical
dirge over the present extinction of novelists, dramatists, painters,
when, feeling ourselves to be in something of the old rogue's vein
of thought, we again took up our OLIVER GOLDSMITH, and—rubbing
our eyes—read thus:—
"The Bee, Saturday, November 3, 1769:—Scarcely a day passes in which
we do not hear compliments paid to DRYDEN, POPE, and other writers of the
last age, while not a mouth comes forward that is not loaded with invectives
against the writers of this. Strange, that our critics should be fond of giving
their favours to those who are insensible of the obligation, and their dislike
to those who, of all mankind, are most apt to retaliate the injury."
And again—for which we thank thee, OLIVER !—
"It has been so long the practice "—[please observe the date]—" to repre-
sent literature as declining, that every renewal of this complaint now cornea
with diminished influence. The public has been so often excited by a false
alarm, that at present the nearer we approach the threatened period of decay,
the more our security increases. . . . 1 am at a loss where to find an apology
for persisting to arraign the merit of the age; for joining in a cry which the
judicious have long since left to be kept up by the vulgar; and for adopting
the sentiments of the multitude in a performance that at best can please only
a few. . . . The dullest critic who strives at a reputation for delicacy by
showing he cannot be pleased, may pathetically assure us that our taste is
upon the decline; may consign every modem performance to oblivion, and
bequeath nothing to posterity, except the labours of our ancestors or our own.
Such general invective, however, conveys no instruction: all it teaches is,
that the writer dislikes an age by which he is probably disregarded. The
manner of being useful on the subject would be to point out the symptoms,
to investigate the causes, and direct to the remedies, of the approaching decay."
And he is remembered as the Author of The Vicar of Wakefield
and She Stoops to Conquer, who so complained of these judgments of
his day. We fancy .thatjwe sometimes see him quoted as a model now;
to say nothing of not a few who have written declining English since.
Times' reporters and other " vulgar," please copy.
MATTHEW ARNOLD ON "NUMBERS."*
[The lecturer dwelt on the errors of majorities, especially in morals and
politics.]
NOTHING so good as a merry minority,
Very few people are sure to be right;
Down with the power of the tyrant majority,
Wanting in sweetness and lacking in light:
This is the creed, in that far Western land,
AKNOLD has preached, and they won't understand.
Though you belong to a feeble minority,
You can look up and be bold with the best,
Nor should a feeling of inferiority
Ever arise in your militant breast;
Take up an ARNOLD'S ineffable song,
Truly the'multitude 's sure to be wrong.
Who shall be sure that he's in this minority,
So that he's truly among the elect.
Let him dissent from all men in authority,
Scoffing at everything others respect:
That's how the etinical trick can be done—
MATTHEW'S minority 's just Number One!
* Mr. MATTHEW ARNOLD'S first lecture was listened to, in consequence
to Numbers f Some are asking if he is going through the entire Pentateuch.

FHOM a " NON-SPOBTSMAN " we have received the following extract
from the Times :—
"THE SOUTHDOWN HOUNDS.—The first meeting of the season took place
yesterday, at Glynde Place, the seat of the Right Hon. Sir HBNHY BRAND.
There was the largest field which has been seen in Sussex for some yean,
over 260 being in the saddle."
"It must have been," says our Correspondent, "an enormous
field; and what a weight-carrying horse f and what a gigantic
saddle! But / don't believe it!"
HONOTOABLY ACQUITTED.—A Contemporary says:—" In 1878 Lord
LOKNE was an untried man. He has so acquitted himself on trial as
to justify the choice." "Next to bein' a untried man," remarks
BILL BXTROLE, "wot I should like is to be put upon trial so as I
could acquit myself. Just wouldn't 11"
"An!" exclaimed Mrs. RAHSBOTHAU, "what an appropriate
name for a Gentleman, who always lives in a state of gambling, the
Prince of MONETGO!"

SWEET HOME.
"DIVES, the owner of property condemned as unfit for habitation, is getting
from 80 to 60 per cent, upon his money."—The Bitter Cry of Outcast London.
SWEET Home! The briar-scented lane is sweet
Some seven miles hence; exotic odours fleet
Through the dull halls that DIVES builds hard by
The hidden bounds of this slime-cumbered street.
But sweetness here f Do blossoms blend their breath
With Malebplge's fumes? What burdeneth
The sluggish air of this rain-sodden slum
Is disembodied horror, worse than death.
Infect with foulness palpable, unveiled,
Miasma at whose breath rude health had paled,
More than the pestilential tropic swamp,
"Where lurks the Slayer by bright blooms o'ertrailed.
Yet more with that, the deeper, deadlier taint,
Impalpable, obscure, unshaped in plaint,
In speech unworded, whose soul-palsying touch
Unnerves the boldest, makes the stoutest faint.
Sweet Home! Sardonic as the Accuser's jeer
Sound the heart-moving words when uttered here,
Where life is a sin-poisoned agony,
And even love a shape of leprous fear.
And Labour? Here the primal curse in sooth
Falls unallayed by mirth, affection, ruth,
Crushing beneath its unrelenting stress
Age's last hope", and the lirst spring of youth.
Such labour! Heaven! to think of fingers thin
Toiling in pain the grey hours round, to win
From the swol'n hoards of wealth some scanty dole,
Tithed by the triflers, who toil not, nor spin.
Tithed? Nay, much more than tithed, for Mammon's grip
Snatches the morsel from the hungering lip:
And Mammon's minions, wringing gold from pest,
Penury's portioned mite shall not let slip.
Property's gold-mine—thit! How sweet to think
That herded thralls of want, and crime, and drink,
Though all too foul to touch the skirts of Wealth,
Well-squeezed, make Mammon's guineas chink!
Not useless, no! Cold Competition's slaves,
At least they swell Pactolus, whose broad waves
With no whit less of eager swiftness How,
That they flow o'er slain victims, or 'midst graves.
Why should they? Whose the blame of that strange flood
Dram down from fetid flats of marsh and mud?
Or who will hold him guilty if the stream
Like Egypt's plague-smit river show like blood P
Brave affluents verily! And Affluence, clean
In show as its new-minted coin's bright sheen,
Battens upon these pest-spots, sucks curst spoil
From lazar-haunts of lust and labour lean.
Choked back from the huge City's thick-piled maze,
Crowded aside from Comfort's cleanlier ways,
They slave and sin and multiply and die,
These pariahs whose strange "Home" disgusts—but pays.

Pays whom? The smug House-jobber, hard of eye
As heart, the Cit, the Peer, the Bishop. Why
Portion too nicely? It pays careless greed
And its blind incarnation—Property.
Sixty per cent.! That covers so much shame,
Dulls too quick sensibility to blame.
"Property " on these plague-spots fatly feeds.
What shall awake it to the higher claim?
Shall it be Pestilence slow stealing hence,
To strike through callous Comfort's vain defence?
Or Misery's red revolt? or the late stir
Of harrowed feeling and indignant sense?
Home? Ghetto plus Gehenna, reeking through
With all abomination, stye, and stew,
Alsatia, torture-house, slave-pen in one!
Once more the cry breaks forth— What shall we do?
Wake wordy fuss, which, rising like the dust,
So falls? Gregariously groan, then thrust
The oft-glimpsed spectre back into its lair,
Sight-banished, but unlaid? Not so, we trust!
Vast problems, many-sided, maddening, wait
Time's slow solution, but we may abate
With Law's swift hand this wrong—that DIVES thrives
Upon the woes of LAZABCS at his gate.
He shall not still, to swell his loved per-cents,
Perpetuate these pest-breeding tenements.
Nor use vile vice and slavish toil as tilth
And pasturage of Wealth in " Mammon's Rents."

* • * * • •
HERE we are at Slickville! As there was only a slight riot at the
Station, and not more than five thousand firemen accompanied me to
my hotel, joining in the new national serenade, "Henry gits nicely
along!" I confess I was somewhat disappointed at the reception.
No: it has decidedly not been all I was led to expect, and it has
therefore been a real consolation to me to receive here a batch of
London papers, and peruse that glorious leader on my first appear-
ance in New York, that somehow found its way into the Times.
How excessively grotesque! I wonder, now, who on earth managed
that.' C. is civil, but ne is certainly no fool. Could it have been
H. ? or W. M. ?—or dear old DODUS rierhaps? N'importe! whoever
did it, it was excellent fooling, and 1 laughed heartily; and when I
showed it to BRAM STOKER, it struck him as so excruciatingly funny
that he nearly had a fit. He took the opportunity, however, of
again impressing most earnestly upon me the necessity of not allow-
ing myself to be carried away, as lam sometimes, in my after-dinner
utterances. He pointed out, almost severely, to me that I had seve-
ral times, with great indiscretion, added to what HATTON had set
down for me to say,—much to the annoyance of HATTON, who does
not like to see his carefully-prepared speeches spoilt by the introduc-
tion of bits of what he calls my "unbusiness-hke and clumsy gag."
I dare say he is right, for I fully admit that I do sometimes forget
the ridiculous humbug underlying all this spouting and screaming
and handkerchief - waving, and find myself compelled to gusn
tremendously. But is not the temptation strong? I am not an
illustrious General, a world-renowned Philosopher, a distinguished
Humanitarian, or even an ordinary Emperor. Why, then, should I
be made the excuse for an unceasing and universal ovation? I ask
BEAM STOKER this, and he only smiles significantly, and tells me to
"mind my own business, and leave it to him." He is a wonderful
fellow is BBAM STOKER. So is my tried and constant biographical
friend and secretary, JOSEPH HATTON. Yes, I will endeavour to act
on their advice! Ha! here come the Mayor and Municipal Authori-
ties crowned in laurel, and ready to carry me on their shoulders to
the " lunch " at the local Tantalus Club.
******
The lunch, though it began well, has been a noisy affair on the
whole, and the little bit I interpolated into my speech about the
growing glories of the rival township of Wittlesburg has, so BBAM
STOKER says, given great offence. I couldn't help telling them that,
when at that rising Western city, after the Second Act of Romeo and
Juliet, a large clothes-basket, full of mango jelly, fresh vegetables,
and Bourbon whiskey, was let down from the proscenium by ropes
of roses to my very feet, my heart went out to my audience .then and
there, and I had .the greatest difficulty in getting it back. I had
scarcely uttered this, when HATTON was pelted with Blue-Point
shell and salad-plates, it having got wind that he is responsible for
my public sentiments. I am extremely sorry, and must really be
careful. It appears that there is some feud between these rising
places, and that my reference has, therefore, been unfortunate. I am
afraid this argues a doubtful reception to The Sells this evening.
BEAM STOKER advises me strongly either to let HATTON play for me.
or go through the Mesmerist Scene with a tinned umbrella. I will
think this out.
******
As I hear the booking is excessively brisk, and have also been
informed that all the people in the Western States have taken a hint
from that clapping lesson I gave the New York Reporter the other
day, I cannot but believe that the reception will be quite tremendous.
I have, therefore, decided. I may wear a japanned tea-tray, up my
back, but—I shall to-night play Matthias myself.
* * * * * *
The ordeal is over. I am standing on the debris of the stage,
surrounded by a crowd of excited literary interviewers. What can
I say of what I thought of my reception, for they are asking me a
thousand questions on all sides P I am trying to recall my impres-
sions of the performance. I tell them that as soon as I came on in
the First Act a shower of rotten eggs established in my mind beyond
a doubt the conviction that I felt my audience. So it was all along:
and when, on the appearance of the Polish Jew. a dead cat levelled
at my head, fortunately hit his instead, my shriek of laughter was so
hearty, so unexpected, and so wild, that it fairly brought down the
house, and enabled the Second Act to be proceeded with without any
immediate attempt to lynch the Manager, or tear up the benches.
But when towards the close of the play I retired to my couch amidst
a hail of footstools, I began to fear I should have tough work with
the Mesmerist. For an American audience is keener, handier,
stronger in the whistle, harderfisted, and takes better shots with an
occasional chair than an English one. At the Lyceum if I stand on
my head the^Stalls receive it in silence, and not a coat-sleeve cracks
with applause. If, indeed, I wish for a handful, I have to get it, as
best I can, from the Pit. Here I got not one, but dozens, from the
whole house. They came in torrents. The stage was like a market-
garden. It was magnificent; and I so thoroughly felt my audience
this time., that in a transport of sympathy, when falling over the
coat of the murdered Jew, I picked up a large-sized cabbage, and
flung it back, right across the Auditorium, into the back of the
Refreshment Saloon. This was the hit of the evening. There was
a rush for the stage, the gas was turned out, and, after a short
skirmish with five companies of ^Marines, the house was cleared, and
we were able to reckon the evening's takings.
Asked then what I thought of an American " pelt"; I said it was
hearty, and, seizing a dead cat by the tail, I flung it into the chan-
delier by way of illustration.
Pressed by the Reporters to say if I thought I should venture on
Charles the First to-morrow night without a couple of six-shooters
in each boot, I intimated that I might possibly get BRAM STOKER to
play it, and sit in front myself and look on.
I was about to give them a few more items of dramatic intelligence,
when they tore on to cable the above to the British PresX. So, on
the whole, I have every reason to be satisfied with my tour.
A YOICE FROM A CAVE.
THE CAVE we refer to is the present lessee of the Elephant and
Castle Theatre—(by the way, why couldn't this lumbering old name
be changed P)—and he has made an important step in the right
direction by heading his programme with this, in the clearest possiole
type:—
'' NOTICE.—In order to prevent unnecessary noise, and that the plot of
the piece may run without interruption, No CALLS BEFORE THE CURTAIN
will be permitted."
Excellent! And no calls after the Curtain either. "When my cue
comes, call me"—and only then, should be the theatrical professional's
motto. The audience will soon get tired of calling if nobody comes.
And of course the printed notice on the stage to the Actors must be
that no calls are to be taken on pain of forfeiture of engagement. This
must apply to Authors, Scene-Painters, Machinists, and Composers as
well. And even when the Composer is conducting his own Opera, he
must at the end of every Act disappear at the first round of applause,
and resolutely set his face against a "call"—and this will oe the
more easy for him to do as his proper position is with his back to the
audience. Yet, stop!—how can the Composer " set his face against"
a call without turning round P This must be thought out. In the
meantime, Mr. CAVE has set a good example, which we trust the
Lessees, Managers, and leading Actors and Actresses will imme-
diately follow. "Friends at a distance (in America) will kindly
accept this intimation." We hope Mr. CAVE will stick to his rule,
and that he will not cave in.

THE WORSHIP OF

HAEDLY have the Mayor and

upon to perform the same
ceremony on behalf of Mr.
BABBY SULLIVAIT. There may

left to present to real heroes
and paragons? If counter-
feit presentments of imaginary
virtues are to be treated in
this way, what will become of
the great soldiers and bene-

do the world some service'(
If every tragedian who fights
a broad.- sword combat is to
be treated as if he had won
a new Agincourt or Water-
loo, these Mayor and Corpora-
tion addresses will lose their
value.
A sober and respectful ad-
miration for one or more great
Actors, that is not adulterated
with Barmunism, and is not
degrading both to giver and
receiver, is worthy of support

goes to the length to which
some of these "demonstra-

PUNCH'S FANCY PORTRAITS.-NO. 161.

SIR MOSES MONTEFIORE,
A "HEBREW OF THE HEBREWS,"
WHO, ON THE 8TH DAY OF CHESVAN (i.e., NOV. 8, "VERY OLD STYLE"),
ENTERS ON THE HUNDREDTH YEAR OP HIS BLAMELESS, BRAVE, AND
UNIVERSALLY BENEFICENT LIFE.
MUD-SALAD MUDDLE.
THE Corporation won't re-
lieve the Duke of MTOFORD
of his Mud-Salad Oarden
responsibility. "It 'a really
asking too much." is what
they seem to say; but they are
wrong, and have lost a chance.
Still, if the Duke can do what
he likes with his own in the
way of selling it, why can't he
earn the gratitude of Lon-
doners by having it kept in
better order under new rule*
and regulations, and, as oppor-
tunity offers, introducing im-
provements, refusing to renew
leases except on certain con-
ditions, and so gradually but
effectually making a clean
sweep of it V If his Grace can
do what he likes with his own,
let him do this. If he doesn't
—then it is either because he
has not the power (and if this
is so, who has?), or the im-
provement which London ex-
pects of him is not what his
Grace likes. Let his Grace,
sacrificing for awhile his en-
joyment of sea-breezes and
the pure Devonshire air, take
the house lately known as
"Evans's," and live in the
heart of Mud-Salad Market for
six months. Evans's would
make a capital ducal mansion.
"If you want a thing well
done, do it yourself"—at all
events, see to it yourself; and
we warrant there would soon
be a decided improvement.
MRS. RAMSBOTHAM was in-
structing her youngest niece
in French manners and cus-
toms. "The 2nd of Novem-
ber, my dear," she explained,
"is the day_when they visit
all the seminaries, and lay
chapels of flowers on the
graves, a beautiful custom!
The French call this day the
Jeu de Mots—a phrase, my
dear, that no doubt you have
often heard, but never under-
stood."
ANOTHER LITTLE HOLIDAY CRUISE.
"Here break we off"—Return by overland route.
NEVER met with such weather as in the Hebrides and in the Scotch
Lochs. No knowing where to have it. It pours, and you put on your
mackintosh and waterproof cap and cape. When carefully buttoned
up in these, out comes the sun, and off come all the above-mentioned
articles except the cap, unless you have had sufficient forethought to
have brought a lighter cap with you. Directly you row, or have
been rowed, or, if on shore, you have walked a few yards, the rain
re-commences, has a short struggle with the sun, conquers, and has
the next half-hour all to itself a downpour in torrents, when, just
as you have made up your mind to return to the Yacht, sunlight
appears, as much as to say, "Hold on! I 'm coming to the rescue,
more powerful than ever!" You hesitate; sun and rain have a
struggle, sun getting stronger and stronger, rain weaker and weaker,
until it disappears altogether, the mists roll away, the mountain-tops
are visible, the sky is blue, the flies come out and bite fiercely to
make up for lost time—(a Scotch fly is a most persistently irritating
insect; when it finds someone it really likes, it scarcely leaves him
for a second, and if it does, it comes "bock agen" fresher than
ever)—and in another moment the waterproofs are voted a nuisance,
are carried over the arm, coat-collars are turned down, some of the
party complain of the closeness and heat of the weather, others pre-
pare to strip off and carry their waistcoats; and all, pace flies, are
admiring the view, when somebody exclaims, "Hang it! Wasn't
that a drop of rain f" Some hopeful person denies it. If KILLICK
has asserted that he has just felt a drop of rain, CRAYLEY will
immediately assure him that he must be mistaken, and that such
a thing is impossible. KILLICK says he was not mistaken, and
declares he has just felt another.
"That time I admit," says CRAYLEY, true to his colour of contra-
diction, under which he would die sooner than yield. "I did, but not
when you first spoke." And in another second the rain and sun
drama is enacted all over again, and, tired of the monotony of the
variety, we return to the Yacht, and—this is the usual resource—ask
at what hour dinner is ordered.
Whatever the time mentioned, if KILLICK is pleased, CRAYLET
sighs; or if CRAYLEY is delighted, and says, "Ah! that exactly suits
me !" KILLICK wishes it were later, or earlier, or at any time, in fact,
when CRAYLEY doesn't want it. CRAYLEY, however, is generally most
pleased when it is at an hour which doesn't suit anyone—not even
our host precisely.
• •••••
Strome Ferry.—Here my brief holiday comes to an end, and I quit
the Creusa. My life on the ocean wave has been a short but merry
one. CRAYLEY also leaves. Other guests are coming to take our
places. KILLICK is to remain for the whole voyage. The Merry
Young Steward keeps up his Mark Tapley character to the last, and
on the morning of my departure he enters the cabin with a radiant

smile to inform the Commodore that " he's been ashore, and there's
no meat to be pot anywhere."
What 'B to be done? The Merry Steward, brighter than ever,
makes a suggestion. "Wouldn't it be as well to telegraph to the
Gentleman who is coming aboard to bring a round of beef with him?"
After all, even the pains of separation can be ameliorated by the
consideration of the sufferings of others. I am going straight through
to Town, and offer to send them any beef and mutton from there;
but at the same time suggest that, as CEAYLEY is going "by easy
stages "—as Cardinal WOLSET travelled—to his destination, he could
send them provisions from Inverness, and, indeed, from various
stations all along the line.
Return "Through Journey" Express Notes,—Strome Ferry to
Inverness. First part of scenery wild and wonderful. Panorama
changes to low and lovely, with Ben somebody in the distance, and
then at Inverness to lower and unlovely on the shore-side, and to
bold and blusterous on the other, or sea-side, -with Fort George at
the farthest point, which I am informed is evidently a nice warm
station for the soldiers, and on that account generally chosen by the
Authorities as a depot for any troops fresh from India. How
tropical must be the situation anyone can judge for himself when
informed that it is built on what Estate Agents call an eligible and
picturesque site, commanding uninterrupted views of the river and
mainland on one side, and of the German Ocean on the other.
Inverness—in time for the table d'hote at all the hotels.
Can only go to one. Fair table d'hote. Usual eccentric tourists, and
wonderful females. Everybody making arrangements to be called
early. Meet a shooting friend unexpectedly, who, having been forced
to remain here alone for some hours, has read two three-volume
novels, and, not liking to dine alone, has determined upon renewing
reminiscences of his childhood by buying a sweet cake, which he
intended to eat with his tsa,—poor fellow!—and so to bed about
eight. I save him from this miserable fate, and in a burst of
grateful hospitality he asks me to dine with him. Pommery sec
instead of tea. I accept, and we foregather till nearly ten, when I
have to continue my through journey" to London vid Perth and
Stirling.
Having bespoken a berth in a sleeping-saloon—there 's still some
slight reminiscence of the yacht about this—I dispose myself for the
night. N.B. (North Britain.) This sleeping accommodation has not
yet been brought'within measurable distance of perfection.
Perth.—Periectly.fresh—as fresh as one ever can be during a night
journey under the present conditions. I slip out, in full yachting
oostume, to breakfast at Perth. More nautical now, on shore, than
I was at sea.
Perth Express Breakfast! If there be an oasis in the dusty desert
of the Railway Station Commissariat system, it is this! it is this!
Cleanly, bright, cold meats, hot drinks, tea and coffee,—I had some
"grounds" for saying that the coffee was not perfect.—eggs and
bacon, salmon,"all on the " cut and come again" principle, hot rolls,
toast-and-butter, real mac-marmalade and jam ad lib., what more
could be desired by the most voracious and capacious traveller with
a clear half-hour before him?
Then off by 7'30 train to Edinburgh vid Stirling, with—and here
is the great defect—no prospect of a wait of more than five or ten
minutes anywhere, and not <Aa<,-^should the train be unpunctual.
We pass through pretty country highly cultivated, but the boldness
has disappeared; the wild has become tame; the waters are no
longer turbulent torrents, but placid streams, or rippling rivulets.
The distant moors suggest grouse, the hillside cottages are neat
and comfortable. The norses sleek and shining in the sunlight;
the cows, evidently accustomed to a regular life, repose luxu-
riously between business hours, while the sheep are contentedly
grazing, never once lifting their heads at the _ sound of the train—
unlike their rough-coated, twisted-horned cousins in the parts we 've
been visiting, which are ever on the alert, and dart away at the
approach of anyfootstep, except that of their own particular attendant.
The " storm-motive " is over, and the " pastorale " has commenced.
Civilisation! Boys begin to cry yesterday's London afternoon
papers, but I have already got the Scotsman, with all the latest
news of any importance from town. I read how pairing has begun,
how everyone is off for a vacation, how the business of the nation is
being hurried through so that Legislators may be off—and "rogues
are hung that jurymen may dine "—and I feel very much like the
boy who has to remain in to do a task while all the others are off for
their holiday,—for I am coming back to work.
Stations en route—
"Berwiek-on-Tweed"—sounds like the work of an author on
"Trouserings." Has a legal twang like " BYLES on Bills."
At Newcastle,—The first thingto see is an Old Castle, probably
the residence of Old King Coal. The town is being vastly improved.
Am told we shall have half-an-hour at York for refreshments.
"York, you 're wanted!" Don't know where this is from. Perhaps
G. A. 8. will respond. His " Echoes" always answer.
York. Very good dinner—soup, fish, meat, pudding, cheese; the
whole boiling and roasting at 2». 6d. a head, to be taken in half-an-
hour, which, deducting three minutes for the walk to and from the
Refreshment-Room, is feeding at the rate of an infinitesimal frac-
tion over a penny a minute. One plateful of anything, however, if
all eaten, will stodge the hungriest traveller unless he's a champion
lunch-eater, and can do it against time. One shilling for a B.-and-S.
is dear, but the profit must be made somewhere.
We race through Doncaster—stop at Grantham for tickets—see
Peterborough Cathedral, and think of Mr. WTTAT.T.EY—glimpse of
Huntingdon race-course—St. Neot's, where, of course, a tidy lot of
people five under the patronage of St. Neot. Flat country—pass
small station, apparently called " London News," as that is all I can
see, written up in white letters on a blue board—cultivation every-
where—good roads—country giving promise of good shooting-coverts
for September—"every bird has his day"—new proverb—close
fields—big hedges—brick-making—new division of panorama—high
yellow banks—station called "Sandy "—remember a Clown of that
name at HENGLEB'S—a mound or two, mere molehills compared to the
hills I've left behind me—fine trees, meadow, grass-land—neat villages
—gardens—shriek of engine—we whizzle past station—the only pro-
minent name I can catch as we pass is Somebody's Mustard, in
yellow letters—corn-fields—gleaners—then a large field of some dry-
looking stuff, which looks like somebody's light hair unbrushed—
more covert—ricks—sheaves—fewer hedges—signal place labelled
"LangjfordBox"—big potatoe-fields—thenbanks—moreTbrick-making
—station called, I think, Marley,—pretty church—park-like grounds
—inclosed fields and big hedges again—more signs of harvest—
"Flying Scotchman" gives a whoop! as his countrymen do in the
national dance, and we rush wildly oy a station, the name of which
is "Arlesey Siding" — what party Arlesey is siding with I
haven't time to guess — fields — high banks — reappearance of
road—village—old houses—old trees—banks again—signal-box—
more harvest—grass and clover-fields—hedges—falling oft in trees—

evidently calling out "Bless the Duke of AB.GTLL !"—then slacks
off a bit—as if a trifle blown—scene changes to Wymondeley—very
pretty—Birket Foster sort of English scenery—then changes to high,
reddish sand-banks—F. 8. going steadily—hurries up a bit before
Stevenage, which we pass in style—neat red-brick town—gardens—
road—more bright-red houses, as if the builder had been a regular

more good coverts—undulating country—sheep. Harvest better than
ever—absolutely "golden grains"—big banks—probably tunnels—

charming farm. Large village—two men—we go under bridge-^-
eountry more undulating—F. S. tremendously elevated—deci-

F. S. going it now—intends finishing well—only about twenty miles
more to do—two more arches—wooded country—horses—cows—but
nobody about anywhere the whole way along, except two men walking
in opposite directions—odd!—is it tea-time everywhere, or dinner-

much the same as before—views shut out—meadow-land—rabbits

THE "FIRESIDE" AT VENICE;
OB, HOW WOULD IT HATE BEEN P
IN the face of the highly complimentary, scholarly, and altogether
admirable criticism that Mr. KCSKIN has just passed on much of
Mr. Punch's artistic work, what can Mr. Punch do but, standing
hat in hand, acknowledge with a respectful how the genius, the
judgment, and the grace that have deservedly won for the great
living Apostle of English Art and Culture the admiration and
homage of so large a following of his enthusiastic fellow-country-
men? For where the verdict runs so musically, and is withal so
kindly, there seems to be scarce place for one jarring note of dis-
cordant cavil. Yet, over the subjoined sentence has Mr, Punch
been sorely concerned and confused. Says Mr. RUSKTN,— having
before him in review one or two selected specimens of Mr. Punch's
Cartoons, —
"Look, too, at this characteristic type of British heroism —' JOHN BULL
guards his Pudding." Is this the final outcome of King ARTHUR and Saint
George, of BRITANNIA and the British Lion P And is it your pride or hope
or pleasure that in this sacred island that has given her lion hearts to Eastern
tombs and her pilgrim fathers to Western lands, that has wrapped the sea
round her as a mantle, and breathed against her strong bosom the air of
every wind, the children born to her in these latter days should have no
loftier legend to write upon their shields than 'JOHN BULL guards his
Pudding?'"
And then Mr. RUSKIN. as if conscious that the very onward sweep
of his own free fancy has carried him beyond the limits of fair
and reasonable estimate, as it were, harks somewhat back again, and
offering Mr. Punch something in the nature of an apology, acquits
him of all true responsibility for this same terrible and offending
"pudding."
"It ii our fault" (proceeds Mr. Buixro) "and not the Artist's; and I
have often wondered what Mr. TUNXIEL might have done for us if London
had been as Venice, or Florence, or Siena. In my first course of Lectures I
called your attention to the Picture of the Doge MOCBNIOO kneeling in
prayer; and it is our fault more than Mr. TENNIEL'S if he ig forced to repre-
sent the heads of the Government dining at Greenwich rather than worship-
ping at St. Paul's."
Now, Mr. Punch, the "Immortal" (again does he bow to the
accurate judgment of his learned Critic) is nothing if not prac-
tical, and so, with a wave of his all-powerful truncheon, he puts
matters to the test forthwith. He has found this commonplace
nineteenth century and its humdrum materials pretty well suited to
his purpose; still, as the distinguished Professor thinks he might
have fared somehow better at an earlier period, amidst more pic-
turesque surroundings, let him try the experiment. Presto.'
Change! Up goes the misty curtain of the centuries, and discovers
to him—say, Venice, in the Middle Ages—thus:—
The Piazza di San Marco an hour before daylight. Enter GIOVANNI
TENNIELO, and the Editor of " Polichinello del Adriatico,"
disguised in cloaks and masks. They both assure themselves
that they are not observed, then approach each other cautiously.
Editor. Ha! You are here! Then you have escaped the daggers
of the vengeful PAJTDOLFINI, notwithstanding the point of last week's
Cartoon! 'Tis well! But say, my trusty and well-designing GIO-
VANNI,—what rare subject hast thou hit upon for this?
Giovanni. Marry, but there is nothing that I wot of, capable of
supplying the merry jest. (Mysteriously.) I hear that the DOGE was
yesternight again tied up in a sack and Hung from the Rialto; but,
good sooth, such old party manoeuvring affordeth material but for
grim fooling, and maketh at best but a sorry picture.
Editor. Trne,—and we have had it before.
Giovanni. We have—twice.
Editor. Canst thou, dost thou think, do aught with the much-
talked-of banquet at the Council. They sav that five of the goblets
were poisoned, and that now the partizans of the Duke of MILAN have
a working majority. There seemeth to me stuff in it? What sayest
thou?
Giovanni. Nay—but, it is gloomy,—and the five bodies would but
crowd the picture. By my faith, I see it not!
Editor. Ha! I have it! Why not the DOGE, kneeling at his
prayers? Come, there be freshness in that—and quaintness too, I
warrant me.
Giovanni (shaking his "head]. But, nay, again—it lacketh compo-
sition.
Editor. Thou art difficult, good GIOVANNI.
Giovanni. Not so: say that of thy subject. But, ha! who conies
this way? (They draw long daggers. Enter RUSKINO, with a lute.)
A stranger! and. striking a sweet note in this dull and miserable
city! What wouldst thou?
Ruskino. Hush! I know thy trouble—for have I not seen thy
work! Alas! how wasted in this gilded sepulchre! For how canst
thou bring wit or wisdom to the fireside here?
Giovanni. We do our best.
Editor. Ay! and thou hast sung in praise of the stilt-wearing
beauties of our GIORGIO DU MATTEIER, and of the doings of BRIGGS,
the intrepid gondolier of GIOVANNI LEECH. Why, then, pelt us with
stones?
JRuskino (sadly). They are but Stones of Venice! Look—take this
(produces a back number). "The Council suspending their judgment
and their DOGE." Is this the final outcome of MABINO FALIEBO and
St. Mark, FOSCABI and the League? And is it your pride, or hope,
or pleasure that this your fair sea-born Mother, whose golden locks
have wantoned in the sweet soft zephyrs of the sun-born south,
should, in her zenith, be able to give you no livelier legend to write
upon your comic shield than "the Council suspending their judg-
ment— and their DOGE!"
Giovanni. Well,—considering the scanty material at our disposal,
we thought it rather good.
Editor. Most decidedly.
Jluskino. Nay, but it is not thy fault—but ours—ay, that of
Venice! Ah! My good GIOVANNI, look, as I do, with prophetic eye,
into the far future, and tell me what it might have been hadst thou
been given to London, at a distant day! Ah no—it is not thy fault
that with such terrible surroundings thou art obliged to represent
Authpritv with its head continually on the block,—rather than dining
occasionally at Greenwich. [They vanish.
And, as the cloud curtain falls, Mr. Punch ponders, and asks
himself, whether, after all, spite the golden glamour of her far-off
glory, and the soul-moving music to which a great master has set her
splendid tale,—the Adriatic Queen may not have had, in her day,
something less noble to lose, even than that condemned typical
"pudding" which JOHN BULL as yet has fortunately known how to
guard.

Upon his land with dog and gun,

Saw pheasants rise and rabbits run;
Flushed the brown partridge from the beet,

And wot ye well such sport was sweet,
When golden Autumn days were fair.
But now the Millionnaire will stand,
Or sit a-near the covert side,
With guns men wait on either hand,

And pots the birds that scarce can ny,

"IN THE MATTER OF
A PRISONER."
(Probable Proceedings if the same Secrecy is observed towards Laymen
as Solicitors.)
YESTERDAY a person (it is impossible to give the sex, for fear of
affording a clue to identification) was brought before the presiding
Magistrate at a certain Police-Court, charged with committing either
a felony or a misdemeanor. The Prisoner, upon being placed in the
dock, was immediately ordered to be removed by his Worship, as the
person had not been clothed in the new regulation mask and disguise-
cloak. Upon these necessaries having been supplied, the Prisoner
was readmitted, and the charge was read in a whisper to the Magis-
trate. A Gentleman of the Long Robe appeared to prosecute, and
the Prisoner was defended by a Solicitor.
The Magistrate. Are there any Witnesses?
Prosecuting Counsel. Several—they are in the waiting-room.
Tkf Magistrate. I cannot possibly consent to have them in Court.
Were they seen they would be immediately recognised, and the
privacy now enforced by statute would consequently be lost.
Defendant's Solicitor. I had foreseen this objection, your Worship,
and as my Client is most anxious that the complaint against him or
her (as the case may be) should be fully investigated, I have arranged
that you shall listen to their evidence through a telephone.
The Magistrate. A very proper precaution. The matter may now
proceed.
Telephones having been supplied to his Worship, the representa-
tives of the parties interested, and also to the Prisoner, the case
commenced. After a whispered examination and cross-examination
of the Witnesses for the prosecution, the Magistrate asked the
Prisoner to make a statement, if a statement were considered
desirable.
Defendant's Solicitor. If you hear the voice of the Prisoner, surely
the sex will be identified.
The Magistrate (sererely). You must be verv ignorant, Sir, of the
manner in which I conduct my Court, if vou believe I could permit
such a miscarriage of justice! (To Usher.) Supply the Prisoner
with the Punch-squeak, known in the Puppet Trade as "Jthe Call."
This useful article (which completely disguises the natural voice)
having been supplied, the Prisoner reserved the defence.
The Magistrate. Very well, then, you are committed for trial,
and, under the circumstances, I must refuse to accept bail for your
appearance in a Superior Court.
Prisoner (speaking in a peculiar falsetto through the Punch-sqtieak).
But won't they discover who I am, your Worship, when I am lodged
in the House of Detention?
The Magistrate. Certainly not, Anonymous One, as every precau-
tion will be taken to protect your incognito. You will continue to
wear your mask, and you will be supplied, on admission, with a
domino equally applicable to either sex.
The Prisoner, having thanked his Worship (through the Punch-
squeak) for his courtesy and consideration, was then removed in the
charge of a male and female warder.
The proceedings then terminated.
AMONG THE 'NEW B.ULES."
WHEN any public professional person is maliciously and unfairly
criticised, whether as an Actor, Author, or Singer, he can bring his
action against the malevolent Critic at Nisi Prius as a "Running
Down Case."
MRS. RiHSBOTHAM says the Champagne she likes best of all is
Promissory. The name being disputed by her Nephew, a bottle was
produced. It was Pommery. I said Pommery," answered Mrs.
RAMSBOTHAM. "And the next best Champagne, I used to think,
was Hideandseek."

On the 2nd of November, 1883, barristers in wigs and gowns were
refused admittance to the Royal Courts of Justice on the score that
they had no business to transact there.' This outrage sjjeaks for

the other Divisions exclusively to exchange bows with the Judges on
their taking their places on the Bench! And now even this privilege
is denied me! The profession is indeed going to the dogs!

GENERAL MUNDELLA REVIEWING HIS AWKWARD SQUAD.
MULTUM IN PARVO;
OR, HOW TO "EXPAND" A SKELETON TELEGRAM.
POLITICAL.
Skeleton Telegram (dated China).—Sick Emperor — War pro-
blematical.
Expanded Despatch (dated " Pekin, by Special Wire from Our
Own Correspondent").—His Majesty the Emperor of CHINA during
the last ten days has been suffering from a complication of ailments.
Commencing with a slight touch of influenza, the chill (contracted
at an evening fete during the Feast of Lanterns) rapidly assumed a
typhoid type. Dr. BONES (whose name appears in the Medical
Directory) was called in by Dr. Hi SKI Hi, a native practitioner,
and the two physicians prescribed a concoction of Senna, Quinine,
and Ki Bosh mentioned in the English Cyclopedia. On Thursday
last His Majesty took a Turkish bath, which afforded him consider-
able relief. On Saturday he was decidedly better, and even was able
to " pick a little." For dinner he managed to discuss a pate made
of puppy dogs' tails (a favourite dish of the Mandarins), and subse-
Siently seemingly enjoyed three large basins of birds'-nest soup,
n the following morning a Cabinet Council was held, when it was
decided that as the French were concentrating in large numbers near
Rpng Too (on the West Coast—the place can be found in the Impe-
rial Atlas), it would be as well to temporise. It is thus very pro-
blematical whether the Chinese Ambassador will receive instructions
to proceed to extremities.
SOCIAL.
Skeleton Telegram (dated Australia}.—Southern Governor—Glori-
fication—Exhibition—Scandal—D rink.
Expanded Despatch (dated "Melbourne, by Express Wire from
Our Special Commissioner").—Early on Thursday morning, this
favourite city, surrounded by palm-trees in full bloom, bearing at
this moment the nests of thousands of canaries, was agog with
excitement. At nine o'clock the streets were gay with bunting, and
the band of the Royal Victorian Guards, commanded by Major SMITH
(whose name will be found in your monthly Army List) discoursed a
programme of sweet music, conspicuous, however, for the absence of
any of the songs of SULLIVAN'S operas. The occasion was the open-
ing of the Exhibition building, which, as you may not know, is
uncommonly like your own Law Courts, except the Conservatory,
which strongly reminds the beholder of the Central Transept at the
Crystal Palace, Sydenham. Bishops of all denominations were
present, and the Senior delivered a neat address, in which he hoped
that the undertaking would be quite successful. Then, midst the
sounds of trumpets and salvoes of artillery, the Governor, who was
in full official uniform, and wearing the insignia of E.C.B., declared
the place " duly opened."
It is to be regretted that so hopeful a morning should have been
followed by an evening of shame and gloom. However, I am forced
to telegraph to you the sad news that at the subsequent banquet
liberty was exchanged for licence. Plainly, all the guests took a
great deal more than was good lor them, and the result was a scene
of dissipation completely baffling description. The Governor him-
self attempted to avoid the impending intoxication by mixing aerated
waters with the more potent liquids in the glasses of the guests.
This he managed to accomplish successfully, as, from drinking to
excess, a large proportion of those present nad become completely
stupified. Unhappily the matter did not end here, as hot blood soon
engenders hot words. Several duels were fought on the following
morning. Two of our leading Politicians were dangerously wounded
in the side by sabre-cuts, and are not expected to survive. In my
next I will give you further particulars.

RANK NONSENSE!
THE Proposed Bill for the Regulation of Hackney Carriages and
their Drivers having been received with some coldness by the class
it was intended to benefit, a new measure is being draughted on the
lines of the original, but going "just a little farther." The following
are some of the provisions :—
1. Anyone hiring a cab shall immediately pay a deposit of £5 to
the driver, who shall not return the money unless he pleases.
2. The hirer of a cab objecting to the use of strong language on
the part of the driver, shall be liable to six weeks' imprisonment
without the option of a fine.
3. Should a driver become " incapably" intoxicated, the hirer will
be bound to look after him, and see that he is not robbed. The hirer
will be responsible to the driver for any damage done to the cab
while the driver is in this condition.
4. Anyone offering less than two shillings for the " cabman's mile"
(800 yards, imperial measure), shall be condemned to five years'
penal servitude.
5. All matters connected with the Cab interest shall be adjudicated
upon by a Committee consisting of five cabmen.
6. If .the driver takes it into his head to horsewhip his fare with-
out provocation, the said fare shall immediately apologise.
7. The driver of a cab shall be exempt from all law. He shall
never be brought before a Magistrate, and any Policeman venturing
to address him shall be immediately dismissed the Force.
8. Should a cab-horse require replacing (at the suggestion of the
Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Animals), the expense will
be defrayed by the first old lady who enters the vehicle.
9. Should the driver require it, the hirer will handle tha rains
himself, while the driver smokes and drinks in the interior.

PUNCH, OE THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
THE LATEST CRAZE.
(Lettersfrom a Young Gentleman, of Fashion who "Adopted the Stage as
a Profession.")
28, Shrimp Street, Shellford, Monday, October, 1883.
MY DEAR DUCHESS,
I MUST write and tell you about my first day and night's
experience of the real Stage. You '11 hardly believe me, but it isn t all
fun, like those jolly theatricals at Granby. You remember the local
papers said I was so good as that Footman who said "Lunchink is
ready," just when they were telling you your husband was dead.
(We mayn't do that on the real Stage.) You know how thoroughly
in earnest I am about it all, so I felt bound to do what they told me
at the Gatherum Club; that is, take a provincial engagement—they
say one learns such a lot. Yes, one does; but, perhaps, not quite
in the way they meant. I can't tell yet what the effects may be of
what I learn, but I think I 'm " acquiring confidence," which seems
to be another phrase for learning to be very rude.
I certainly never knew there were such a lot of Actors and Actresses
about. You, my dear Duchess, are very fond of the Stage, and you
like to entertain those who entertain you with recitations and songs
and that sort of thing, you know; but you haven't an idea of how
many Actors and Actresses there are about, for you don't see one
quarter of them in London, and not one hundredth part of them
could you be possibly acquainted with. They all tell me it
isn't their faults, poor things, and I'm sure they all mean very
well—it seems hard they can't manage quite as well as they think
they can before the Curtain goes up; but then, of course, people's
tastes vary so much; perhaps, if they pronounced words as we did at
Granby, the audience here mightn't like it.
I must tell you, as far as I can, what has really happened. It was
awfully kind of you to persuade Mother to send GEORQE to look after
me; but he's going back; he says he belongs to the London Foot-
man's Conservative Association, and can't stand the life here, and he
don't think my Mother could stand it either.
I 've taken the name of EXCELSIOK McALpiN, because I mean to
get up the ladder like IRVING. I should do it quickly if I could
manage it with his strides; but then I haven't got his legs. I
arrived here yesterday, Sunday (it's not much of a place); but
wasn't it lucky I found old Lady AWEBERRY had taken a house at
Seaborough—she 'd heard I was coming, and sent over to ask me to
dinner, and had actually asked Miss POSTER to meet me—so like her
—(Miss PRISCTT.T.A POSTER is my Manageress, you know). Miss
POSTER asked me a thousand questions. I told her I didn't want to
take up any particular line at first. I wanted to try and play every
sort of part. This seemed to please her, because she said they tried
to do with as few people as possible, and so I could play a lot of
parts every night; and that then I should get so very handy in
changing my clothes, which is a great thing to learn. She said she
wouldn't pay me quite at first,; as it wouldn't be fair on the others;
bat in time she hoped to give me something. She put it all very
nicely. She said I might wear the things in her wardrobe,—when I
say 'her wardrobe " this doesn't mean that I am going to assume
feminine costume in burlesque, but it means the stock of dresses
belonging to her Theatre or Theatres,—some of them, she said,
had been worn by Actors in the time of MACHEADY, and ever
since (because she's had the Theatre Royal, Shellford, for thirty
years). I daresay they might have inspired me, but, on the
whole, I thought 1 'd rather have my own things. She told me to
come to rehearsal next morning at ten. Her audience like Melo-
drama, and she was going to produce one in six Acts, which she would
have liked to rehearse more than once, if circumstances had per-
mitted it, but the stage had been wanted to paint barren rocks
and parching plains of some Desert, so that they would have to
do the best they could with one good rehearsal. I 'd never heard of
the play before, but Miss POSTER said it was most interesting, and
nobody had to pay for acting it, which she thought so "English"
and like the days of Free Trade. This is her view of " encouraging
the Drama." A very practical one, I think, as the more plays you
can perform for nothing, the more you can play. If ever Ibecome a
Manager, 1 shall always play SHAKSPEABE, because they tell me
there are no "Authors' fees" for representation. Why should
Authors have fees? Where would they be without the Actors?
This is what Miss POSTER and the others say, and I am not quite
sure whether they are not right. When I used to play with
Amateurs for a Charity, we always thought it rather hard to have to
pay an Author for performing his piece. Of course paying for the
Theatre to perform in, for the band, for the Costumier, and for the
printing, is quite another thing. I said this, and Miss POSTER quite
agreed with me, though she was of opinion that if Amateurs wanted
to play for a Charity, they should play for the Benefit of a Provincial
Manageress who was always doing her best to support and encourage
Dramatic Art. Lady AWEBERBY liked the sentiment, and asked her
to dinner again next Sunday. (Miss POSTER is quite fit to dine with
anybody; she found out a corked bottle of Champagne directly.)
I was so anxious to please, that I got to rehearsal next morning
before Miss POSTER had arrived, and I was stared at by a lot of men
in ulsters. They didn't look at all well off, like the ones we know
in London; but there, my dear Duchess, the ones you have at your
house in London, where it first struck me that I should like to go on
the Stage, are just three out of a thousand. I thought I'd better
begin to talk to them, because I wished to be very civil; so I told
them who I was, and I don't think they liked it. One of them
observed it was usual for a new member of the Company to " stand
drink"; I said I had brought no drinks with me, but I 'd send for
GEORGE, and see if he could get some from the Hotel or wine mer-
chant, but the man in an old ulster said there was no need to do
that, he would go himself "round the corner," and get enough
"Mother-in-law for us all. (This was the first professional thing
I learnt, and I don't know that it's much help.) "Mother-in-law
is old and bitter beer. Of course, my dear Duchess, you can't be
expected to know that. I don't like beer myself, especially in the
early morning. I said I would pay this once, but I couldn't always
pay, because I was just the same as they were, trying to make my
living. I'm sorry to add that this gave great offence. They said, after
vhat I 'd told them, they wouldn t accept my money, but would all

However, it came to

exactly the same thing.
Miss POSTER arrived very different to what she 'd been the night
before at Lady AWEBEBBY s; she was very cross, the Stage Manager
came with her—(poor man! I '11 write to you more about him. I 'm
now trying to get his son into the Bluecoat School. Could you help P)
—somebody had given her a bad shilling, and she seemed disinclined
to attend to the rehearsal in consequence. The Ladies of the Company
and some more men in ulsters had been dropping in all this time.
Some brought chocolate, others apples, and one or two shrimps, which
they offered to me after I had been introduced. (I must have it put
in my engagement that I am not expected to take miscellaneous
refreshments like this, or I shall be ill.) I began to get very tired of
all these preliminaries, because I had come on business. Everybody
said they were ill, but would do their best. Most of them had near
relations dying as well. The theatre was very dark and draughty, and
there was an old charwoman-with the worst cold I ever saw, or heard,
clearing up the pit. Miss POSTER said I must forget " Belgravian
drawing-rooms lor the nonce." I didn't like to ask her what
"the nonce" was. She feared her dressing-rooms were not to
be compared to the "boudoirs of the nobility." She had arranged
for me to dress in the same room with a Mr. GABBICK and a Mr.
DEBWENTWATER, as she believed they were both well connected, and
so she thought I should like to dress with them. I think, after all,
it is more the man himself than his relations, when it comes to dress-
ing in the same room, and I thought it a shame their influential
fnends didn't help them to get a little better underclothing.
Rehearsing then began in earnest. It was difficult to grasp the
action of the piece, as the band and carpenters were all rehearsing
at the same time. It was most confusing; bits of tunes, shouts and
hammering, and moving of scenes just when one was going to speak.
Everybody had to copy out their own part, as there was only one
book of the play. This doesn't seem to be a great encouragement to
Dramatic Literature, but perhaps it is a " very rare old play." Miss
POSTER, who plays the heroine, would constantly break off in the
middle of her heartrending speeches to scold somebody pretty sharply.
I will tell you all about the play in my next. I hope I am getting
on in my profession. My brothers write to me that "it isn't a pro-
fession at all." That it's "all bosh." MARCUS says that not very long
ago Actors were all "rogues and vagabonds" by Act of Parliament.
This is unkind of MARCUS, but both he and JIM, being in the Army
and at the Bar.won't allow there are any other professions, I suppose,
though Uncle ROBERT is in the Church, and SAM in the Navy. But
of course those professions are not like this. The Drama is
ennobling,—at least, so they said at your house, my dear Duchess,
and I dare say they knew all about "Mother-in-law," and "odd
man out," only they wouldn't tell me. Yours very truly,
HWJO DE B"*.
HOMICIDE AND VULPICIDE.
A FRIGHTFUL crime is reported from East Cornwall—an atrocity no
less horrible than that of "Poisoning a Pack of Hounds." At the
opening meet of Colonel COBYTOITS Foxhounds, the bow-wows
ifwere observed to make a set at some dead fowl. Shortly afterwards
they showed symptoms of poisoning. Before they reached home six
had died, and others are not expected to recover." So far so bad;
and it is difficult for the hunting-mind to conceive anything much
worse than an attempt to poison foxhounds. But in this instance:—
"It is supposed the fowls had been placed in order to poison foxei."
Homicide, though unintentional, perpetrated in the commission of
any felonious act, amounts to murder. In the hunting-mind's eye, it
is at least no palliation of the poisoning of foxhounds, even if true, that
it was the result of an attempt to poison foxes, however accidental.

THE DEVIL'S WALK.
FEOM his sulphurous realm as the sun goes
down
The Devil is walking once more,
To visit his favourite vineyard, the Town
That stretches by Thames's shore.
Over the bridges and through the Parks
He strolls, and along the streets,
A presence that fails to elicit remarks
From the hurrying hundreds he meets.
There is nought to suggest that he comes as
a guest
From regions torrid and drouthy,
He has altered his ways since the simpler
days
Of COLERIDGE and SOUTHET.
A jacket of red and breeches of blue
He knows would be far too striking,
And as for a tail!—even DABWIN'S crew
Would hold that in sore misliking.
There is naught unaesthetic about him at all,
Not a hint of the diabolic:
He's trim as a citizen bound for a ball,
Or a " Masher " out on a frolic.
And what, oh, what is the Devil's aim?
Oh, never a titled preserver of game
Through his covers with watehf uller interest
strolls
Than this " noble sportsman," whose quarry
is souls.
He seeks it not in nut-scented heather,
Green coppice, or golden stubble,
But in London's slums in detestable weather
(This Sportsman doesn't mind trouble).
He sees a spectral scare-crow thing
Slink into a slum-fouled alley.
And he mutters, "With cowl and with
scythe and wing,
He might lord it in Death's own Valley."
He sees a roof-rotten, muck-sodden den,
To the gutter ready to tumble.
Says he, "Well, if this be the dwelling of
men,
We haven't much reason to grumble."
Then steps he into a " tenement-house,"
Through a dark but doorless entry.
"Little need," chuckles he, "for a lock or
a key
Whilst my brace of friends stand sentry."
He climbs a rotten and rickety stair,
Foul tilth its cracked walls smearing.
"Why, chaos," says he, "had a pleasanter
air,
And needed less careful steering."
And what, oh! what, does the Devil behold
In these reeking chambers, barren; and
cold?
What Satan himself might scruple to tell,
Lest his language should shock a less
hideous hell.
He sees commingling of Labour and Vice
In joint contamination.
Quntil he, "This, indeed, were a spectacle
nice
For Belial's contemplation."
Sees Childhood, broken with ill-paid toil,
'Midst sin's contagious venom.
Says he, "For friend Moloch's favourite
spoil,
This beats the Valley of Hinnom."
Then he sees a House-jobber grubbing for
gold
Amidst festering Vice and Poverty cold,
And says he, I 've one henchman more
trusty and bold
Than the ogre worshipped in Ammon:
Beelzebub's doughty, and Astaroth 's good,
As snarers of souls with a crown or a snood,
But the first, most ubiquitous, best of my
brood,
Is my ruthless, respectable Mammon!"
• • * •
So Satan, seeing that all went right
In his big branch-Hades by day and night
To his personal pleasure and profit,
Back to headquarters swift wended his way.
"I shall sicken," said he, "if much longer
I stay;
For though sulphur's not pleasant, I really
must say
'Mammon's Rents' are more choky than
Tophet."

HUNTING PUZZLE. NO. 1.
How TO GET OVER THAT GATE.
ANOTHER INWITATION TO AMERIKAY.
I HATE jest receeved a letter from New York of such extrornery
a character as fairly puzzels me. It begins "Dear old Cuss." which
BROWN tells me is Amerikan for Dearly beloved Cuzzen, and it says,
putting it shortly, that as the Lawyers of Amerikay has inwited over
the gratest of our Lawyers, and the Poets of Amerikay has inwited
over the gratest of our Poets, and the Actors of Amerikay the gratest
of our Actors, so the Waiters of Amerikay would like to see the
greatest of our English Waiters!
With that yuthf ul modesty so nateral and so becoming to a Eng-
lish Hed Waiter, I fust blushtj and then I dowted. I examined the
Enwelop carefoolly and showd it to a G.P.O. of my acquaintence, but
he sed as it were all rite and no mistake, it had suttenly cum from
New York, and, luckily for me, post paid, for as it cost ever so many
cents for postage, and every cent of course means a hundred sum-
thinks, I should nave had to pay a lot of money for it.
• Well, the letter goes on to say that the Waiters of New York have
subsribed a fabylus sum to pay my xpenses, and will give me sitch a
resepshun as will simply stagger me. What they wants me to do is
to read, as Lecters, my contry bushuns to your most poplar periodickle.
They are reddy to engage the largest of all the large Alls in New
York, but I don't quite understand what they means by its being in a
Awenue, coz I 'm afeard that would be werry drafty, and to give me
all the prophets and to pay all the losses, if there is any, and they
says that as there is about 10,000 of 'em in New York alone, and each
on 'em has plenty of frends. and they shoud charge art a doller
admittance, which BKOWN tells me is about 2s., they coud garrand-
tea me a good thousen pound.'
I declare I 'm in sitch a wirl of egsitement as I reeds and reeds it
ower and ower agin, that, tho' it seems odd, I carnt ewen keep my
old specs on my old nose for presperation. He says they has menny

storys I can't understand, but that's their bizzeness, not mine, and
if they means wot they says, and does what they says, they may larf
and larf till Hall's blue, whoever Hall may have been, praps a relay-
tion of Blue Beard's,
My fust diiferculty is about the woyage. I am suttenly not a fust

Wot a week! Memry looks back with a shudder and forrard with a
groan. But then think of the reckempence. The I hadmirashun of
my feller waiters, and praps, a thousand pound! A thousand pound!
Why, with sitch a sum as that I coud realise the dream of my burly
manhood, and take a nice little Pub in a good ard-drinking nayber-
hood, and live at my ees, and be the horacle of my own back parler,
and relate my egsperiences of my perfeshnal life, elustrated with little

My Co-respondent says as all my predecizzers has bin werry sucess-
fool, speshally Lord COLLINOHIDGE, but then look how thick he
spread the butter, and don't the Amerikans jest like it. He write*
that if he wood only have allowed Mr. BAKNEM, or some other of
their great geniusses, to have taken him in hand, and took him round
the Country, he mite a maid at least a hundred thousend dollers!
Mr. IBWTNO the hactor was so run after, that sum peepel acshally

TRIUMPHAL ENTRY, AND ALDERMAN HADLEY UPSET.
THOROUGHFARE OR NO
THOROUGHFARE.
As Bow Street is the most
important connecting link in
the series of streets, squares,
bridges, &c., which form
nearly the only central com-
munication worth speaking of,
between the North and South
of London, it is as well to
know whether it is a Thorough-
fare or a No Thoroughfare.
After many years' experience
we are unable to decide the
question, and shall be much
obliged to the Authorities—if
there are any Authorities?—
who will kinoly assist us. In
the morning it is generally
given up uncontrolled, to the
Duke of MUDFOHD and his
Clients-and then it is decidedly
a No Thoroughfare; in the
middle of the day it is fairly
passable; but sometimes at
night, and especially on Satur-
day nights, it is made impass-
able for cabs or carriages at
the will of some mysterious
Police Official. Policemen bar
the entrance from MERE-
WEATHEB'S to the publican's
at one end, and from the
boiled-beef house to the publi-
can's at the other. Dr. Jomf-
SON defined a fishing-rod to be
a stick with a hook at one end
and a fool at the other; and
we may define Bow Street to
be a snort bit of road with a
Duke at one end and a Police-
man at the other.
To "ALAEJIIST."—No. The
Chinese are not all cannibals;
only those belonging to the
"Man-chu Dinnersty."

(A Handbook to Beady-made Oratory.)
PAET IV.—PAB.OCHIAL SPEECHES.
PERHAPS of all the Orators contained in the United Kingdom, the
Vestryman has least need of assistance in speaking. The fact that
he is a Vestryman is an infallible proof that he has (as he himself
would term it) "the gift of the gab." As a rule, he is the proprietor
of a ham-and-beef shop, or is deeply interested (by deputy, for in
this case his wife does the work) in the selling of cabbages. Some-
times he belongs to the educated well-to-do trading class, but
then he is swamped in the mass of petty shopkeepers who surround
him. Sometimes again, but very seldom, he happens to be by birth
and education a gentleman, and then he shows his utter unfitness for
the Vestry by never appearing at its meetings. So rarely, indeed,
are Vestrymen anything but what are termed "highly respectable
tradesmen," that it is unnecessary to consider them as belonging to
the classes above them. It has been said that these exalted worthies
require no guidance in the wallfiowery walk of rhetoric bordering1
the floor of the Court-house. But every rule has its exception, and
it is just possible that there may be a Vestryman not belonging to
the " genteel" and silent order, nor to the well-to-do trading class,
who has not the courage " being a Westryman, to be'ave as sieh." It
is to such a one, if he can be found, these hints and suggestions are
addressed. It will be as well, perhaps, for the benefit of the unique
individual to whom allusion has been made, to give
A. Rough Sketch of an Ideal Vestryman.
Costume.—May be either a slovenly-cut suit of tweeds, or "a coat,
vest, and trousers as advertised" of black cloth. Pot-hat worn with
both. If under forty, flower with long stalk sticking in button-hole.
Thick and dirty boots, indifferent linen, and alpaca umbrella.
Voice.—Should be rasping. Unless it can be heard not only in the
Vestry Hall but in half-a-dozen Committee Rooms beyond, it is
practically useless.
Tone.—Pert, abrupt, overbearing, and yet semi-respectful with
brother Vestrymen. However, on special occasions a professional
joke may be permitted; for instance, about the price of ham-sand-
wiches or the adulteration of moist sugar. Sharp with the Surveyor.
Obsequious to the Clerk of the Vestry, especially if that Official
happens to be a Solicitor. Stern to the Rector, and generally offen-
sive to everybody else.
Mode of Delivery.—Head thrown back, right hand advanced.
Usual commencement of speech, "Now, look 'ere, I want to know."
Peroration, "I tell you what it is, we must not be 'umbueged. Not
we. So I tell you. one and all, that we '11 precious soon let 'em see
what we want, and that's all about it!"
The Vestryman is not at his best when performing his official
duties. When he has to defend himself against a charge of gobbling
and guzzling at the public expense, his indignation jumps well
over the gap dividing the sublime from the ridiculous. On other
occasions he will raise his strident voice to ask, "Why the
Vicar 'as 'is name printed on circulars without them there two
Churchwardens?" And if he is not falling foul of the Church, he
delights in a fad. For instance, it suddenly occurs to him that the
act of a street-boy using a rod and line in fishing in a local canal may
be dangerous to the Public. He argues that if anyone caught their
leys in the string, they might do themselves a serious injury—one
might fall on nis nose, another tumble into the water. So the
Vestryman calls attention to the use of rods on the local canal,
and the matter is referred to a Committee. This Committee applies
to other Local Committees, and the body swells and swells until
it reaches a certain magnitude. At this stage, a deputation is
chosen to wait upon a Cabinet Minister. The Statesman receives the
Vestrymen " with the utmost courtesy" (as the published report of
the latter is subsequently careful to state), and quietly snubs them.
The Right Hon. Gentleman is of opinion "that the Vestry have

ample powers to deal with dangerous rods and lines, and therefore
cannot pledge himself and his Cabinet colleagues to indefinitely post-
poning all other Imperial business while they give their undivided
attention to the passing of a Bill making unauthorised minnow-fishing
by children punishable with seven years' penal servitude." The depu-
tation is bowed out, and returns to the Vestry for comfort. A large
bill is run up for various incidental expenses, and the matter is
brought before the delegates of the Ratepayers on numerous occa-
sions, always to meet with the same fate, "adjournment to another
occasion." And here be it noted that the golden rule of the model
Vestryman is; "when in doubt—postpone." This is a most useful
custom; for instance, when some Ratepayer, who enjoys the honour
of the acquaintance of one of the elect, wants to put up a conserva-
tory in his front garden. The Vestry constitutionally objects to any-
thing that could be regarded as either a novelty or an innovation,
and the conservatory in the front garden answers both descriptions.
But the petitioner for the sweet boon knows a Vestryman. Here
arises a difficulty. The Vestry must act up to its principles, and yet
has no wish to affront one of its own body, so the matter is—" post-
poned."
At the'commencement of the proceedings of a Vestrv gathering,
the minutes of the last meeting are invariably read ana confirmed.
These minutes are rather of a perfunctory character, and, in the
cause of information, might be made infinitely more interesting. As
a guide to would-be municipal orators, subjoined are
The Minutes of a London Vestry slightly improver?.
The Churchwarden, supported by the Vestry Clerk and the Sur-
veyor, took their seats at their raised desks, and assumed an air of
defiant reticence.
The Vestry Clerk read the minutes of the last meeting amidst a
hum of voices.
The Churchwarden read a long list of proposed disbursements of
Ratepayers' money, amounting in the aggregate to several thousand
pounds. After each proposed disbursement he called upon those
present to signify their assent or dissent "to the expenditure in the
usual manner," adding, immediately after making the request, the
word "carried."
During these votes the conversation was general.
On reaching the vote for the payment of £2,547 12*. 8}<7. on
account of the poor,—
Mr. BHASSLUNOS wanted to know why one of the paupers had been
deprived of some of his coat-buttons. It was said that the Master
of the Workhouse was " most "aughty," and expected all the inmates
to " touch their 'ats to 'im." Now lie (Mr. BRASSLT/NGS) thought
The Churchwarden (interrupting). Mr. BRASSLUNGS, you are now
making a speech, and not asking a question.
Mr. Brasshings (to admiring colleagues, satirically). Oh, ain't "e
sharp this morning i1 (Laughter.) I do say it's a shame that
The Churchwarden continued his reading, and the objections of
Mr. BRASSLUNGS were ignored.
The consideration of the schemes for turning a ruined local burial-
ground into a handsome park, for paving a main road with wood,
for causing the dust-holes in the dwellings of the very poor to
be periodically cleared, and several other propositions admittedly
extremely beneficial to the public, were postponed.
The \estry having then to open tenders, all but the personal
friends of the would-be contractors drifted away, and the meeting
was adjourned.
To sum up. A Model Vestryman does not require to be a polished
orator. His words seldom get further than the columns of the local
paper. Here they are seen after undergoing a revision which has
reinstated lost aspirates and corrected bad grammar. But what
matter sense and culture to a nominee of the Ratepayers? In con-
clusion, London will indeed be worthy of pity if forced to take in
exchange for the ponderous stupidity of the City Alderman the
impertinent incompetency of the Model Vestryman.
SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.
FROM all parts of the country we have continued to receive most
favourable accounts of the opening day of the season, the Fifth of
November. There were plenty of Uuy Foxes everywhere, and some
first-rate runs, chiefly from policemen and infuriated householders.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR WEALTHY DRAMATISTS.
THERE may be poor Actors nowadays, but no poor Dramati
Authors. Not to be behind the fashion of the present time, whe
everybody craves to know what everybody else is doing, when he:
doing it, and how it's being done, we are grateful to an unknow
Correspondent, who signs himself an " Occasional Pall Mall Gazettee
Paragraphist, for the following interesting details, and the publi
will agree with us that Dramatic Authorship is at the present tim
a highly remunerative profession:—
Mr. W. G. WILLS is a Millionnaire, having made his money entirel
out of Charles the First, while the poor Actor of that important rul
only received three pounds a night for the entire run! This is n
fault of Mr. WILLS'S. But clearly some "redistribution" i
required here. Mr. "W. G. WILLS lives in several castles in th
North of England: keeps five steam yachts, and two or three pack
of hounds. For his new piece at the Princess's he receives fiftj
thousand pounds down before a line is written; and Mr. WILSO:
BARRETT binds himself over to him to serve him as a slave, to wor!
his farms, do boot-cleaning, or go out to the Colonies for him, o
anything, if he should fail in producing the exact sum by twelv
o'clock next Friday.
Mr. W. 8. GILBERT, as a Dramatist, made five hundred thousani_
pounds by one piece at the Olympic, some years ago, which sum havini
been advantageously invested in Botany Yarns (on which he ii
founding his Burglar's Tale), still brings him in the handsome sum
of one hundred thousand pounds a-year. His income as a Librettis
would amount to fifteen hundred thousand a year, but for the
necessity of sharing it with Sir ARTHUR SULLIVAN, who insist
upon receiving his pound of flesh." or, rather, his two-thirds
or ten hundred thousand pounds of flesh, paid quarterly. Findinj
his present house too small, Mr. GILBERT is in treaty for Bucking-
ham Palace. He stipulates for the sentry-boxes remaining with
sentries in them. Sir ARTHUR SULLIVAN, who is to have a wins
of the building—for. as his Librettist gracefully says, he couldn''
indulge in such high flights but for Sir ARTHUR'S wing,—insists
upon these sentinels having been through a campaign at the Itoya
College of Music and being skilled vocalists. This proviso hai
for the present brought negotiations to a standstill, but it is saic
that the brilliant Librettist and gifted Composer, on agreement witl
the Buckingham Palace Authorities, will refer the matter to a mutua
friend who,—
In spi
Will accept their invitations,
And remain an Engel-ishman,
—and who will probably be accommodated with a room in the Palace
(near the Critics' Banqueting Hall) all to himself, fitted up with
the latest-invented telephonic apparatus, communicating with the
Librettist's and Composer's apartments, so that at any instant he
may be informed of every wonderful rhyme or extraordinary musical
phrase that may occur to either of the talented partners.
Messrs. HERMANN and JONES have only recently started in busi-
ness, but they have already achieved a fortune which will make the
entire ROTHSCHILD family envious. It is variously stated at from
sixteen to fifty millions. Messrs. HERMANN and JONES are insepar-
ible. Their equipages are familiar to all Londoners frequenting the
Park, where they both drive a collaborating team of eight horses.
Their benefactions to their countrymen are well known.
Mr. G. R. SIMS is in receipt of one hundred and fifty thousand
rounds per annum from his Lights of London, in the Metropolis
done. From the representations in China, Japan, Persia, and
one or two other places (where the drama is localised and sharpened
up with topics of the day), he has realised the magnificent sum of
£275,008,005 19*. lllrf., with which he furnished his present man-
don. As the Librettist of the Merry Duchess, he shared with Mr.
FREDERIC CLAY the Composer, a couple of millions; and this would
lave been more, but for the unfortunate result of the Derby, which,
"t is an open secret, hit these two talented gentlemen rather hard.
Mr. GILBERT A BECKETT by one piece at the GERMAN REEDS' made
over a hundred and sixty thousand pounds. His hunting-lodge in
he Midland Counties is a model of perfect taste. It is open house
Tith him all the year round j and though hunting five days a-week
except in the summer, and it 'B difficult to prevent him even then),
le yet finds time to write the libretti of French and German Seven-
Act Operas. Of these he speaks, in his light and airy way, as " mere
rifles thrown off before breakfast." But it is well known that
hese trifles represent two hundred thousand pounds each. His forth-
soming Opera, Savonarola, has teen purchased by a syndicate com-
losed of the Emperor of GERMANY, Emperor of AUSTRIA, the King
f HOLLAND, and the French House of ROTHSCHILDE, for upwards of
hree millions sterling, one quarter of which has been already sub-
bribed, and the remainder guaranteed. If the guarantee is not
made good, the instalment will be forfeited, and Mr. GILBERT A
IECKETT will be at liberty to sell it over again.
Mr. HERMANN MERFVALE'S new mansion cost him a hundred
thousand pounds. The drawing-room is inlaid with precious stones,
and the mantelpiece (constructed by the Author) is one blaze of
J • _ J _ TT _ _ill A !• • •. i . -ii i « i * ...
diamonds. He will not live in it, but will only go and look at it now
then, as he prefers the residence he has occupied now for some
and

years, and which ne lately furnished lavishly out of his receipts from
the Cynic. He made just on half a million by the play he wrote
for Miss GENEVEEVE WARD, who, of course, such is the irony of Fate,
was but little benefited pecuniarily by the successful work. Mr.
HERMANN MERIVALE spends about ten thousand a year in fishing-
rods, and is endeared to all mariners on the more aangerous parts
of our English coast by his patented invention for saving life at sea,
and safety nets for the herring fishery.
Mr. F. C. BURNAND, as a Dramatist, makes fifty millions a year.
He is largely interested in Electric Lights, and has bought up most
of the patents. By a piece called Unlimited Cash, a few years
ago, at the Gaiety, which only ran a few nights, as the expenses
were so enormous (one may buy gold too dear), he realised a quarter
of a million, after granting Mr. JOHN HoLLn?esHEAD a splendid
annuity. His last new coat cost him over five hundred pounds, and
his hatter, haberdasher, shoemaker, and tailor divide about sixty
thousand a year between them. His shooting-box and moors,
arranged on the most luxurious and expensive plan, cost him a hundred
thousand pounds to keep up. He is a great benefactor to the various
lines of rail which meet at the junction station near his place, as he
is always sending vans laden with game all over the world. His
pieces played in America (where there is no copyright or dramatic
right) produce—by the courtesy of the Managers, who feel themselves
in honesty bound to make him some acknowledgment—an income of
ibout from seventy to ninety thousand pounds a year. As a Librettist,
lie would have made another couple of millions out of Cox and Box
[after sharing with Mr. MADDISON MORTON) but for Sir ARTHUR,
then Mr. ARTHUR, SULLIVAN'S claim for a hundred thousand, which
Mr. BURNAND at once doubled, as a token of his esteem and friend-
ship.
Mr. H. J. BYRON has never made less than a million a-year. He
las several times tried to do so, but without success. He has houses
and gardens all over England. He always travels by private
engines, with saloon-carriage attached, having early in life taken a
lislike to horses. Mounted outriders precede him at a galop, with
lags to warn the approaching travellers. He spends the winter in
tndia, tiger-hunting, and writes most of his pieces in the cool of the
morning, when in his palanquin on the back of an elephant He
•eturns for the season to London, and his Western Palace—as it may
ndeed be termed—is the rendezvous from morning till night, or
rather from morning till morning [as it never closes], of Tout ce qu'il
I a de plus gai, de plus brilliant, de plus savant, in all London.
i. great amateur of music, he has ten magnifioeniprivate bands,
and three Composers at five thousand a-year each. He says he can't
mderstand Mr. W. S. GILBERT being content with Buckingham
'alace as a residence (if he gets it), as, for his part, he likes a place
IB can move about in. His Elephant Saloon in his second London
louse, which he only uses when he is "passing through," can be
een during November, from twelve to two, by anyone obtaining an
ntroduction from the HOME SECRETARY, backed by the PRIME
IINISTER and Archbishop of CANTERBURY. He realised sixty millions
>y Our Boys, and has pensioned off Messrs. JAMES and THORNE with
a handsome competency per annum as a recognition of their past
ervices.

ions may be necessary, op hearing from any one of the Dramatists named, in

Food v. Cram.
THE suggestion that destitute children obliged to attend Board
chools should be supplied at school with penny dinners seems good,
nd feasible. Less than a pennyworth of oatmeal a head would
fford a fairly tilling mess of porridge, and not cost much. Nor
could that small expense necessitate any great addition to the rates,
light it not readily be met by a reasonable reduction of the Bums
ow expended in attempts at putting sciences and literature into the
eads of children destined to become plough-boys, errand-boys, shop-
oys, and servant-girls?
THERE was a paragraph last week in the Times headed, "The
tatus of Solicitors." Mrs. RAMSBOTHAM read it without her glasses,
nd then putting down the paper, exclaimed, "Well, I do not see
"hy Solicitors should have Statues."

(Extracts from the ZHary of his Majesty.)
November 1st.—WEISS PASHA has just informed me that the Unselfish Repre-
sentative will arrive in time for the celebration. He is coming all the way from
Paris by the Eastern Express. So pleased, as I am very curious to see what he is
like. WEISS Pasha says that he is being ted up well, so that he may be nice and
fat for the final ceremony. He was greatly pleased with the first dinner they
gave him when he entered the train. I am told he wrote columns to a London
paper about the waiters and the napkins. The only thing that disappoints me is
that he should liave neglected to have brought PAIN or BROCK in his suite. How
can the affair go off properly without Fireworks?
November 2nd.—PHII.IPPI BEY has been with me all the morning. It seems
that the Unselfish Representative is not an Englishman by birth, although his
name sounds like an English imprecation—"Blow it!" This is the more credit-
able. I can understand a native of the country submitting to the terrible sacri-
fice, but that a foreigner should offer himself to undergo so great an inconvenience
seems to me incredible! However, he is said to be very eccentric, which may
possibly account for this noble act of self-sacrifice.
November 3rd.—Was shown a letter from Lord DUFFERIN, in which the
British Ambassador expressed a wish that I should be informed of the arrival
of the Unselfish Representative. It is rather perplexing, this semi-official recog-
nition of this painful act of self-abnegation. However. I should be the last
to complain. Here am I about to be as much favoured as if I were living in
Bridgewater or Lewes. I do hope that before he finally disappears there will be a
really good explosion.
November ith.—It is all arranged, and I am to see him. PHIUPPI BEY has
managed it beautifully. On my way to the Mosq ue he is to be propped up outside
a window, so that I can have a good look at him. The difficulty about the
etiquette of our interview is smoothed over. It appears that he will walk in on
condition that he is permitted to sit down the moment he has entered. Of
course, I am glad of this, as if he had been carried in in his chair by two
persons walking before and behind (his favourite mode of travelling), the breach
of manners might have established an inconvenient precedent. I am looking
forward to to-morrow!
Noi-ember 5th.—The great day has arrived, and I have
seen him! He was propped up on the window-sill as
arranged. I never saw anything more grotesque and
amusing in my life! He quite realised my anticipations!
Much funnier than a wooden puppet, and just as help-
less. He had his feet hanging down, and his toes turned
in, just as I had seen them in the pictures! I hurried
over my prayers, and had him brought in. RAGHIB BEY
acted as interpreter. I asked him if he thought we
should have a tine night for the ceremony? He replied,
through the interpreter, that he thought that there was
just enough wind to blow the smoke away. I explained
to him how deeply I regretted that I should not be able
to be present when they lighted up. He replied, that
after all there was not much to be seen so far as he
personally was concerned. One celebration was much
the same as another. So with a bonfire. Put anything
into it, and it soon loses its individuality. I admitted
that this was the case, and to change an awkward subject
(although I must declare that it seemed to give him no
distressi, asked him if he had brought his lantern with
him. He replied, "No;" that as ne had got the old
original, he thought it best not to bring it. So it is
left at the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Asked him why
he was secured to his chair when he went out for a
ride? He answered that it was an English custom,
and prevented unanticipated ejectments. Expressed my
surprise that he was not more gorgeously costumed
—he was wearing a plain tourist's suit. He said that
any old clothes would do for his purpose—that it would
be a pity to work in his best. Uimn this, I said, to make
him look a little grander, I would confer upon him the
order of the Medjidie, second class. Rather extrava-
gant this! However, my visitor seemed pleased, and soon
after took his leave. On bidding him adieu, I wished
him a fine niirht for the interesting ceremony.
November 6th.—I can scarcely write for rage! How-
ever, I have had the whole of the Cabinet sewn up in
sacks, and thrown into the Bosphorus! I will teach them
to impose upon me! RAOHJB BEY, who acted as inter-
preter, has taken to flight. Very wise of him! I have
just seen a translation of the Times' account of my
interview with the Anglo-Frenchman! The audacity
of the thing! I am actually represented as talking
politics with a person who I was given to understand
had been brought all the way to Constantinople that I
might see him before he was burned as a Guy Faux on
the 5th of November!
"LIKE A CRAB, IT CAN GO BACKWARDS."
THE Times, of November 14, in a curiously ill-tempered
and illogical leader, laid it down as an axiom that Men
of sense make up their minds on these subjects (i.e., reli-
gious doubts) at an early age, and it is only rather jxxir
and narrow-brained persons who are troubled at thirty
with any question about the form of religion they have
lived under." It has probably occurred to many persons
that the selection of the age of thirty was singularly un-
fortunate, and though prima facie, intended as " a nasty
one " for Lord RIPON, it was indirectly a rather severe
commentary on the doings of Dr. MABTIX LUTHER, who
certainly did trouble himself considerably "on these sub-
jects " from thirty to thirty-seven, and hadn't quite done
with them at forty. The names of GAVAZZI, BLANCO
WHITE, and some others will recall themselves to the
memory of those who see that "Saucefor the Goose," &c.
In another article on Friday, the Times, which has
been having quite a little religious dissipation, says :—
"To this day the French workman talks of Protestantism with
the same airy ignorance as his forefathers. There is something
Kinrli-h or German in it to his eyes, and he is not far from
believing that a Protestant cannot be a good Frenchman."
Now, substitute "English Times Leader-writer" for
"French workman," and "Roman Catholicism" for
"Protestantism ; " substitute also "foreign " for " Eng-
lish or German," and " Roman Catholic and Englishman"
for " Protestant and Frenchman" et fabula narratur de
Times. The paragraph amended would read thus :—
"To this day the English Times Leader-writer tnlks of Roman
Catholicism with tha some airy ignorance as his forefathers.
Ther« if •onwthing foreign in it to his eyes, and he is not fur from
believing that a Komon Catholic cannot be a good Englishman."
The superior intelligence that directs the ready pens of
the Leader-writers is evidently behind the Times.

Monday.—Very glad I rescinded my permission to Heir STOCKER,
the leader of the "Jew hatred," to lecture at the Mansion House.
See what a rteeption he got when he did open his lips! Howled
down! Very properlv, too. Consideriug that Sir MOSES MOXTK-
FIOBE has now entered his hundredth year, it is simply disgraceful
to say anything against the Jews. Besides, if there had been a row
in the Egyptian Hall, the stained glass windows might have been
smashed, bo, take it all round, we are well out of it.
Tuesday. — Application from the Anti-Mock-Friendly-Societies
League to hold a Meeting in the Mansion House. Though rather
sympathising with the objects of the Association, was forced to
refuse their request. Silly of them to select »uch a stupid title.
"Mock-Friendly "—evidently an allusion to the Society of Friends.
The Quakers are a most respectable class of people, and 1 am the last
man in the world to sanction any sneer at their expense. Especially
us I know that if I did so, I should be called to book by a certain
member of the Corporation. Decide, then, to refuse the application
with scorn and contempt.
Wednesday.—Everybody seems to want to use the Egyptian Hall!
Drama at heart, who are anxious to meet together to consider tlie
advisability of petitioning the Government to subsidise a theatre fir
the exclusive performance of Shakspeart." Well, in its way I sym-
|i»i his« with the movement. In fact, I should have no objection to
asking questions of my Right Hon. Friends in "another place."
Hut the thing won't do in the City. Some Common Councilman or
Alderman would be sure to ask questions about it. No, no; were a
Meeting held about the future of the Drama, during the absence of
our leading Tragedian in America, the proceeding would be regarded,
and justly regarded, as a slight by the Irringitei! This would never
do, «o must write to refuse the application.
Thursday.—Another petition for the use of the most comfortable
room in the Mansion House! Too bad that people should want to
turn me out of my own little study in this way. But they will—they
always ask for the Egyptian Hall! However, on thU occasion, I
think I can stump them. Permission requested by a Mr. MOCKER to
lecture "Upon the History of Country Fairs and the Origin of
Booths Generally." A nice row there would be in the Court of
Aldermen if I consented! Why, I do believe, it would cause even
Sir RuLiriiL CAHDKN to say a naughty word !" Booths Generally."
Why. of course, the lecture would include "General" BOOTH, and
attack the Salvation Army!
Friday.—Once again! But there can be no doubt about my course
in this instance. My excellent friend. Alderman HADLKT, 1 feel
sure, is regarding my movements with interest. The Society of
Sincere Believers want to hold a meeting; just like their impudence!
I would not offend Agnostics in general, and Mr. BRADLAUGH in
particular, for the world.
Saturday.—Ah, come now, don't mind this. The Antipapistical
Society wants to hold a meeting in the Egyptian Hall to protest
against Romanism. Certainly. I shall enjoy it immensely, so that
nothing is said against the Jews, Dissenters, and Atheists. But stop,
Alderman DK KKTSKH is a Roman Catholic! So perhaps, after all,
I had better take time for consideration!

LORD MARE'S DAY.
NONE of us a knowin wot 'a to foller, like the Gests at dinner wen
there ain't no Menu, I was detennind to see all 1 eoud connekted
with the grand proceedins of Lord Mare's Day. So I managed to
be pressent at Gildhall on the heighth hinstant to witness the sollem
and affeotin serrymoney of Lord Mare's Heave. Ah that was a seen
that was. No wunder the Liverymen, all in livry, flockt in crowds
to see it;, and no wunder so many on 'em seemed to be took with sitch
bad colds just at the most affectingest moment.
"At 2 o'Clock by the Gildhall clock," as the Poet says, two Lord
Mares cum in together, hand in hand, and marched in sollem state
to the place of execution, where the Town Clerk, looking pail with
snrpreat emoshun, awaited their arrival to perform his sad office.
His rich manly woice trembled as he administered the customery
dioklaration to the New Lord Mare, and his three stately bows
wanted sumthink of their ushal dignerty, dowtless from the same
caws, for the makin of that dicklaration by the new Lord Mare,
speakin metologically, reelly decappytated the Old 'un, for drecly the
words was huttered, without no paws, off went the 3 cornered Cocked
At of Power, and he was again a simple Alderman!
_ Wot his feelinx was at that supreme moment who can tell? but
his manly feetures bore the smile of stoiekle resignashun.
Then forth stept the Chamberlane in a full court soot with a lovely
floury veskit, and walkin up with three graceful bows, gives up the
City Purse to the old Lord Mare, who gives it to the new 'un, and
he, after feeling of it and finding, I spose, as there was preshus little
in it, hands it back to the Chamberlane, who is so jolly pleased to get
it agin that he makes three more gracefool bows and acshally walks
out backards! A pretty lot of praktisin he must have had before
he could do that I shood think. Then the old Lord Mare and the
New 'un departs in peace, but tho' they both goes together, this time
the left one's right and the right one's left.
That same evnin, as is our mwaryable kustom, we all assembuld
as usual and seated ourselves round our kustomary round table and
drunk our kustomary bowl of punch, which I has the honner to bru,
and at 12 oClock percisely, at Midnite, we stands up on our feat, and
we drinks in soil um silence to the pious memmery of the late Lord
Mare! and then in fresh bumpers, with three times three and one
cheer more, we drinks to the prosperous rain of his noble sucksesser.
I had herd the rain a peltin down the Chimbley like one o'Clock
jest before daylight, and my thorts nat'rally turned to the poor Lord
Mare's footmen's silk stockings as they walked thro' the streets amid
ribbald jeers. However I rowsed myself betimes from my nupshal
couch and pulled myself together at duty's caul, as Ingland expeos
every Waiter to do on such a sollum day. and fourth I storked, fust
to the Manshun House and second to Gildhall. With that kindness
of art for witch I hopes as I am sumwhat remarkabel, I sort out the
poor Lord Mare's Postillion who I had herd was to be discarded from
his long suit, and found him to my extreme satisfacshun arayed in
all the gorgeous parofy nailyer of his dinnitide and importent offis.
As time pressed, nis only remark was, "If ever, ROBERT, they takes
off my two leaders, they "11 have took the fust step towards a Ansom
Cab, and the rest will be all down hill with not no skid on!" and so
we parted.
I m told as most people thort as the Sho was a werry fine 'un, of
course there 's no a counting for taste, but, to my mind, bails of
wool, and legs of mutton, and a lot of birds full of stuffing, and
chestes of Tee, was but a werry poor substitoot for real Men in
Banner, who I was sorry to see absent, and that I have no dout
made the mob angry, and so I acshally herd 'em hiss the LOKD MARK!
which so effected my sperrits that 1 rushed into the Cryp and drownded
'em in a bumper of sherry. I then sat down to meddytate, and the
thortful Butler, a old frend of mine, seeing my state pi mind, kindly
guv me a second, and then reckomended me to take just 40 winkels,
witch I did for jest about a cupple of ours, and then woke up qnite
refreshed and prepared for the wust.
The bangkwet was much as usual, tho' I thort the thick turtil
seemed rayther thin, but then custom makes an ed Waiter almost as
fastidious as a Alderman. I was again struck werry forcibly by the
estonishing fac that many of the gests would leave the xquisit delly-
oacies of the table a moat untouched, and prefer sitch werry wnlger
food as cold beef, merely because it s cut off a werry big joint, and
called a Barren instead of an Aunch!
The speeches was jest a little long, hut if ever I seed a look of
estonishment, and amazement, and wunder, it was when the LORD
MARE torked the two furren langwidges of Latin and Greek rite bang
at Mr. GLADSTUN. Whether it was that he couldn't quite beleeve his
ears or his eyes, I of course don't know, but he certainly couldn't
take either of'em off his Lordship, for estonishment. All I can say
is, there wasn't not one of us Waiters as could understand a singel
word, and 1 rayther thinks as even sum of the Worshipfool Court of
Aldermen was in the same predickyment (which BHOWN translates
to mean, "what the dickens he meant.") But there was no diffikulty
in understandin what the PRIME MINISTER ment when, having got
over his estonishment, he told 'cm all that the late Lord Mare was to
be nighted, and become Sir ENERY It IOHT. How they did all cheer,
and speshally when he added that it was the QUEEN'S own wish.
I 've no dout that it was partly owin to what Lord DARBY told 'em
the other day, that when the QUEEN is about to make a man a
Ambasseder or a Lord Leftennant or a Night, or sumthink of that hi
and lofty caracter, the fust question as she asks is, what sort of wife
as he got, and in this case the anser was so sattisfactery that Her
MAJISTY said, as Natur made her a Lady from her birth, and the
Lord Mare made her a Lady for a year, I will make her a Lady for
life. And so she did.
We hadn't no Dopk, witch I was sorry for. I alias likes a Dook
or 2.. It gives a distangay tone to the hole proseedings, tho' they
ginerally sits as dum as Gog or Magog, but I've no dout as they
makes up by a lot of thinkin, and will be werry usefool to us w«n
the grate fite cums, if, as Mr. GLADSTUN finely said, "it hever do

PART V.—" THE DRAMA," TREATED FROM A MUTUAL-ADMIRATION
POINT OF VIEW.
THERE are many toasts that recently have grown in importance.
The chief of these is unquestionably "the Drama and its Professors."
Not so very long ago, to be an Actor was to rank as a vagabond. But,
nowadays, this is changed. A popular Tragedian or Comedian
receives nearly as much attention in Society as a Royalty. He is the
bright particular star of the firmament wherever he appears. Hostesses,
famous for their high respectability, stand at their drawing-room
doors, eagerly awaiting' his coming. Hosts, notorious for their love
of punctuality, wait hours for him, patiently, while the soup is
thickening, ana the birds are being burnt into cinders. Sometimes
the popular Tragedian or Comedian condescends to visit the house of
an influential Critic or a celebrated Author. On these occasions he
retires into a corner with the "most useful person " he can find, and
hides himself away from the common herd—a body composed of the
very class to which he himself belongs. To this "useful person"
(who is, of course, connected with the Press) he will confide his future
plans, and mention the sums that have been taken during his engage-
ment at the Theatre to which for the moment he is attached. He will
call that "useful person" by his abbreviated Christian name, and
adopt a tone towards him suggestive of the tender devotion so often
existing between a proud young mother and her dearly beloved first-
born. In general society he will not be required to say much. So
long as he has an eye-glass through which to smile, he is as safe aa
possible. If he be a Tragedian, his smile must be sad; if a Comedian,
knowing. It is only on public occasions that he will be expected to
speak. When he takes a benefit, for instance, he will say a few words
about SHAKSPEARE, his own love for the town in which he is acting,
his desire to be buried in their midst, and last, but most important of
all, the exact amount of the nightly receipts. He should feel that
the stall-occupiers before him, having paid half-a-guinea a time for
their places, have a right to be in his confidence. Of course, it is of
the last importance to them to learn that he reverences the great
national Poet, has a preference to the local cemetery, and has made a
good deal of money by the exercise of his art. They will be all the
happier for this knowledge—all the better. His speech at a banquet,
organised in his honour, however, will be rather more complicated.
He will have to reply to a number of the most fulsome compliments
without sacrificing hia dignity or overstepping the mark which

separates the sublime from the ridiculous. Of course, he will belong
to the Mutual Admiration Army. The regulations of that gallant
Corps should be of assistance to him at such a time. He should
remember that he is the best possible Actor, and that his friends
who tell him so are the best possible Critics. He and they together
combine to represent absolute perfection. But, as an example is the
safest guide, the handbook assumes a dramatic form for the purpose
of illustration:—
SCENE—A gorgeous Banqueting Hatt, fitted wiih notabilities. Birth
at the high table, Genius and Talent somewhere below the salt.
The Guest of the Evening's health has been drunk with immense
enthusiasm. The Guest rises to respond, and the cheering is
frantic; he smites, and handkerchiefs and dessert-knifes are
flourished deliriously. The Toast-master obtains silence, and
the reply commences.
Guest of the Ertning (bowing gracefully right and left}. Your Royal
Highness, your Graces, my Lords, my Lord Mayors, my Right Reverend
Prelates, and—hem—Gentlemen, or, as I know you would prefer me
to call you all, my dear, good, worthy friends—(Cheers]—here I
thank you. (Cheers.) The noble Duke seated some little distance
from me on my left has told you, in proposing my health, that he
and I are old—may I say it?—"pals. (Laughter and applause.)
He has not deceived vou. (Cheers.) We were boys together;
and I am sure you will believe me when I tell you that I have
always found ARTHUR WAITER PLANTAGENET, twenty-third Duke
of Ditchwater, one of the very best, one of the honestest of fellows!
(Immense enthusiasm, during which the Speaker shakes hands with
the noble Duke in question.) Ah, it is a very long time since we
started on our careers. Twenty years ago I was trying hard to
get the most menial employment in connection with a country Circus,
and my friend, my good friend—(addressing the Duke)—you are a
friend, ARTHTTR, dear fell«w!—(Cheers)—and my good friend the
Duke was just going to Eton. That is twenty years ago. We have
succeeded since. He has gained considerable distinction as a States-
man and Diplomatist, and has been made a Knight of the Garter.
(" Hear, hear! ") As for me—well (smiling) you know my career.
(Immense cheering.) I think we may indulge in mutual congratula-
tion. You tell me that I am the best possible Actor. (Enthusiastic
applause.) I am afraid yon are rather partial—(" No, no.'")—that
you estimate my poor abilities at too high a value. (" No, no ! ")
Well, be it as you will, and I will grant you that I am the best pos-
sible Actor. (Thunders of applause.) But if I am the best possible
Actor, you are, unquestionably, the best possible Critics. (Renewed
applause.) But this evening 1 would rather sink myself in my Art,—
in my profession. (Cheers.) I would say, take us at home, at the
theatre when only a "T-light" is ignited, and the auditorium is
empty. I would ask you where do you find such courtesy, such
exquisite good breeding, as at a rehearsal? (Applause.) I would
say to you, where do you find such perfect domesticity as at the
fireside of the Actor? (Thunders of applause.) Yes, my worthy
friends, I can safely say to the Judges, send your daughters on the
stage to rehearsal, where they will be treated as if they were the
first Ladies of the land, and to the Bishops, give your sons to a pro-
fession where they can take to themselves helpmates who will never
desert them. (Enthusiastic cheering.) And of one thing be quite
certain. Our highest aim is Art. (Cheers.) We have no jealousies,
no love of gold. (Applause.) So long as we please you, we are satis-
fied, as we feel that when we meet with your approbation, we are
receiving the commendation 'of all that is best in the civilisation
of the nineteenth century,—all that is worth most honour in the
•whole of Christendom. (Wild enthusiasm, lasting for a quarter
of an hour, amidst which the eloquent Speaker resumes his seat.)
Of course the above is merely an outline of a speech, which may
be filled in to suit the idiosyncrasies of the place and the hoar. But
it is in the proper key, and should wake responsive chords in the
breasts of all present. The golden rule of the orator can be summed
up in four words: "Praise, to receive praise." Or, to adopt a home-
lier tone, "The best way to earn your bread is to deal in—butter!"
Worse and Worse.

THE LATEST CRAZE.
(Letters from a Young Ocntkman of Fashion who "Adopted the Stage as
a Profession.")
MY DEAR DUCHESS, 28, Shrimp Street, SheUford.
I HAVEN'T much time, but I continue where I left off, and
thank you so much for your invitation, which, as I am rehearsing all
day and playing at night, I cannot, I regret to say, accept. _ You
know in London your Actors only '' got their Sunday out," for dinner.
I told you about my going to rehearsal. You remember the sort
of people I mentioned as being on the stage. Well—the play (of
which we only had one rehearsal in the day, we played it at night)
is about Miss POSTER, who goes abroad for fun with some friends.
They, however, fall into the hands of wild Arabs, but are saved
at the last moment from death by the leader of the tribe, who,
oddly enough, turns out to be an old flame of Miss POSTER'S. Well,
then they come to a place where the charge of Tel-el-Kebir is going
on. They arrive just in time to join in the hurrahs and display of
bunting after the victory, and to be asked to breakfast by the
General. (I was the General.) Unfortunately, just as we were going
in to breakfast, Miss POSTER'S lover is bitten by a deadly snake.
The scene next changes to Australia, where Mr. DERWINTWATEB,
a convict, escapes, and vows vengeance against Miss POSTER'S lover.
It appears he knows something about Mr. GARHlcx_(Miss POSTEE'S
lover), who is his hated rival in the affections of Miss POSTER. In
this scene I am a Prison Warder with a soliloquy, in which I inform
the audience the convict has really been pardoned, but that I have
kept the letter back from the Authorities for no particular reason.
Then come a lot of vicissitudes in the course of Miss POSTER'S love;
she sucks the poison from Mr. GARRICK'S snake-bite, and is very ill
herself afterwards. The Arab tribe are tempted to revolt against
their leader by the convict, who arrives all right from Australia; but
Miss POSTER says such nice things about the QITEEN and England's
banner, that everybody, except the convict, surrenders to her. The
convict is not to be done, though. He declares he's my son, and I
believe him, having lost one. (I'm the General.) He next accuses
Miss POSTER'S lover with desertion from the Army, and having struck
a superior officer years back. I refer to my books, and find it was
so. I 've got rather a good speech at the end of the Fifth Act, sen-
tencing Miss POSTER'S lover to the lash.
A telegram suddenly arrives, stating that the Earl 'of Mount
Cashville is come out to die in the immediate neighbourhood, and
wishes to see Miss POSTER at once. (I am the Earl.) The convict
starts, first meaning to assassinate the Earl before Miss POSTER can
arrive, and then get into bed, like the Wolf in Red Riding Hood.
and frighten Miss POSTEK when she arrives. But this is all stopped
by a most extraordinary sequence of events. The Old Earl recognises
the convict as the son of his valet, changed at birth for the General's
son, who really is Miss POSTER'S lover. The Earl himself has enjoyed
the title and estates for seventy-five years wrongly, as he's not
legitimate, and Miss POSTER is really the Countess in her own right.
The convict is so upset by all this, that he confesses it was he who
struck a superior officer, under the assumed name of Miss POSTER'S
lover. The Earl can't stand any more, and dies. Countesi POSTER
marries the General's son (who is just saved as the first blow of th»
whip is descending on him), and they engage the convict as a gardentr,
as he knows all about plants in Australia.
I can't explain it any better, because much confusion reigned, both
at rehearsals and at night. Such loss of temper, and turning-up of
noses! I was so busy, also, rushing to the little closet I dress in to
change. First I was the Old Family Coachman, with a dialect, who
was sorry Miss POSTER was going abroad; then I was Captain of the
ship Miss POSTER went out in, and danced a quadrille with her;
next I played an Arab Guide, and was murdered in the Swamp Scene
twice, because I fell so near the footlights the first time, the Curtain
couldn't come down, so I was pulled up and murdered again; then
the General, a Convict Warder, and the Earl. The General and the
Earl were much the best parts; that sentencing to the lash and con-
fession of illegitimacy went splendidly. The audience, consisting of
several people, seemed delighted. There was a good deal left unex-
plained in the story, but the ends of the Acts (the final " situations ")
were all right. The guns went off, and the band didn't miss the cue for
"Rule Britannia." I '11 tell you such a lot about the people them-
selves in my next letter—it's all so new. Au revoir, my dear Duchess,
I am yours very truly, HUGO DE B***.
MR. GORING THOMAS, English Composer, never scored a bigger
success than when he scored Esmeralda. It has made a great hit at
Cologne, and the Cologmals are enthusiastic. His name we have
already illustrated, it is suggestive of a " duet for horns." Laudatory
Critics ars all for GORENG THOMAS, but you '11 take a deal of bating,
THOMAS.

itself filled and packed for the fourth time.

IN the year it was late,
But Madrid was en fete,
The Bolero was sounding amain,
When, a youth from fair France
Came to ask for the dance,
The hand of a beauty of Spam.
When he saw with a wince,
That a gay Teuton Prince
Was au mieux with the mantilla'd maid,
His moustache he did twirl.
Crying, " Sacr-r-r-e! False girl!!
I 'm a leetle bit late, I 'in afraid!
A leetle, a leetle, a leetle bit late, I'm afraid.'"
Now, this gallant French youth
Had been lacking1, in sooth,
In ix>liteness; a tit of the spleen
Had quite made him forget
The most plain etiquette,
The result of which rudeness was seen.
His last chance was flown;
"With the Teuton she's gone!
Spanish nuts on my rival!" quoth he.
"It is plain whom she loves;
She takes Berlin wool gloves,
And has given the mitten to me!
Has ffii'en, hat given, hat given the mitten to
me.'"
Xow some might have thought
He 'd have followed and fought,—
That a challenge should come at this stage;
But this gallant from France
Knew he hadn't a chance.
Though he felt in no end of a rage.
So, wiser by far,
He—postponed thoughts of war,
But as homeward he went, muttered he,
"Manana! He's strong.
But he '11 find before long,
Le didble to pay—and that s Me!
Le iliable, le diabU, le diable to pay—and

MR. PUNCH AND TURTLE.
WE are informed by the Timet that Turtle
Soup, the delight of Aldermen, is largely
composed of Conger Eel. But Mr. Punch
was the first to make the discovery. If the
curious reader will consult our Eighty-first
Volume, p. 30, he will read as follows :—
"Conger Eels are caught on the Irish
coast. The people will not eat them, so
they are iced and sent to London. A fearful
whisper went round the room as to their
ultimate destination. When it reached the
ears of the two Aldermen present, they were
seen to turn pale, and one of them presently
left" The whisper was as follows :—" The
awful-looking object that the poor hungry
Irishman disdains to eat, is, when the demand
for" the especial luiury of Masters and
Wardens, Aldermen, Sheriffs, and Common
Counoilmen " is great, and the supply small,
manufactured into real Turtle Soup!"
In relation to this important subject, it
may be stated, as a most remarkable coinci-
dence, that whereas two Aldermen were
present when this astounding revelation was
made, and were both, as stated, visibly
affected, it does so happen that, shortly after
that fatal day, two Aldermen voluntarily
resigned their high position and retired into
private life.
WORTH PRESERVING.
AN old-fashioned Country Squire writes to
us thus:—Sir, Why continue your attacks
upon the " Duke of MCDFORD, as you coll
him? Because his Oraoe will at last do some-
thing if you persist — he '11 maka some
alteration in what you stigmatise as " Mud-
Salad Market." If his Grace does anything
of the sort,—if he makes the slightest change
in Covent Garden Market, no one will regret
it more than mvself and some of our Old
Tiewig Club, as Covent Garden Market is the
only place in London where I can get a sniff
of a perfume that reminds me of the country.
Yours, ANTONY LUMPKLN.

as a permanent memento of the Art Exhibitions lor the

Bravo! St. Jude has again and again proved itself a
Church of great spirit—in fact, a Jude d esprit, and not
hampered by narrow notions of rigid Jude-mc economy.
"Mosaic is eternal," said GHIRLANDAJO, and it seems
that six square feet of eternity can be had for £200. St.
John's Church, in the Waterloo Road, is said to be con-
templating a similar investment. The Pall Mall Gazette
hopes that " these Mosaics may pave the way for many
more." This is equivocal, but the P. M. O. is not to
be suspected of a joke. Mosaic pavements are common
enough already, but these High Art Mosaics would pre-
sumably adorn our walls. And thereby hangs a horrid
haunting suggestion. What if the Advertisers get hold
of the notion 7 We wish well to the Art-idea—so long

CHRISTMAS LEAVES.
THE Fairies sat in Council and they passed in quick review,
Smart albums, cards and picture-books, bright, beautiful, and new!
They come in scarlet and in gold, a brave defiant host.
They come at morn, at night, at noon, by Fairy Parcel Post!
From ROUTLEDOE in the Broadway and from CASSELL on the Hill,
From MARCUS WARD in Chandos Street, from MAN SELL come they still;
From GRIFFITH, too, and FARRAN and from WATERSTON also,
From HILDESHEIMEH, FAULKNER and from MARION & Co.:
From FREDERICK WARNE in Bedford Street, from RAPHAEL, TUCK &
SON,
Come the Fairy Parcel-Postmen exuberant with fun!
Now Cobweb, Moth, and Mustard-seed will here divulge to you,
The critical opinion of the Fairyland Review.
Bedight with gold and colours bright are countless Christmas cards,
The work of many Artists with the song of many Bards!
The Maids of Lee, The Men of Ware, are graphic, bright, and terse,
For HODGSON does the drawings and WEATHERLY the verse:

'Tis bright and Henty-taining—G. A. HENTY at his best!
In Time of War, by JAMES *. COBB, details the Commune's strife;
Cadet to Captain, PERCY GROVES, depicts a soldier's life.
Mid and Ensign is a treasure to " the fathers of the men ;"
The pictures are by PETHERICK, the tale by MANVILLE FENN.
Oh, KINGSTON, well-beloved of boys, though thrilling varns you spin,
You never spun a better one than that called Paddy Finn!
While Chums will suit the youngsters well, as SEVEBNE tells the tale
And HARRY FURNISS illustrates, "there's no such word as fail."
But if you want bright books for girls, as sure enough you must
Read Mrs. GELLIE'S pretty tale—she calls it Nora's Trust.
Miss MARSHALL'S Court and Cottage, you will not forget to view,
And Lily and her Brothers we must introduce to you.
The Holly Series, for Holly Days—a very patent joke,—
They 're just the thing, the very thing for very little folk!
There's Little Thumb, by ANDERSEN—a King in Fairyland—
With cuts by LAURA TROUBKIDGE, you will never leave unscanned:
Brave Ztces.by CLARA MATEAUX, would be difficult to match:
Myself and Friends, for little ones, is writ by OLIVE PATCH,
A simple tale for simple folk and full of good advice,
And Daisy Dimple's Scrap-book is a baby's Paradise!
You never saw, we '11 bet a crown, a smarter volume than
The TAYLORS' pleasant verses, which are christened Little Ann.
The flavour of a faded age revives again to-day
In countless pretty pictures by expert KATE GREENAWAY!
And Phiz's Funny Stories and his Funny Alphabets,
Will smooth the road to knowledge for innumerable pets;
And CALDECOTT'S brave Picture-Books, we hail as Christmas comes—
They 're better far than pudding, and they 're quite as full of plums!
Here's dear old HAWTHORNE'S Twice Told Tales and Tanglewood
also,
As fresh as when we read them first a many years ago;
The numbers called the Queen's Gift, will the youngsters quickly
spot,
And won't forget the series that is named Forget-me-not.
Philip Farlow, writ by TROWBRLDGE, to read you can't refuse,
Captain Pimple's strange adventures you '11 merrily peruse!
While Robin, by SCOTT GATTY, you '11 reckon very nice.
With C. A. DOYLE'S quaint drawings to the favourite Blind Mite.
Here's the British Army Album, of very choice design,
For friends who 're in the Cavalry, the Guards, or in the Line:
And here's the Fairy Album, and you clearly understand
Its graceful and unique designs come straight from Fairyland.
With books in gorgeous bindings, pink, green, and red and blue
We 've only space to mention in the Fairyland Review.
THOUGHT by a Goldsmith on seeing the Lady Mayoress eating
Turtle—" She Stoops to Conger."

A NIGHTMARE OF FAIR
WOMEN.
(By Leporello Junior.)
sundry double-esses
After supper and ex-esses,
Thus I dream— oh, Janes and
Bessies,
Marys. Fannys, Anns, and Jessies;
Though my waking soul confesses
You have laughed at my addresses,
Sleep my wounded spirit blesses.
For I dream how Marchionesses,
Viscountesses and Duchesaes,
Queens and various Princesses,
(Brandenburgs and Guelphs and
Besses),
Girls with fish and water-cresses,
Ballet-dancers, shepherdesses,
Canonesses, Bishopesses,
Authoresses, Poetesses,
(Chiefly of the "upper closes "—
Here my wilful pen digresses),
Fair Circassians and Turkcssos,
Dreamy and divine Jewesses
(Some with rather long nos*«»es),
Women with all shades of tresses
(All, though, more or less heir-
Mies),
Crown my passion with successes,
Never saying noes but yesses!
How they fight for my embresses!
Bring me into endless messes, —
As their beauty effervesces,
Like a Seidlitz coalesces
With mv love, and so liquesces,
While their waists my fond arm
presses —
This is but a dream, I guesses.
EVEBYTHINO was going wrong

SIR FREDERICK AUGUSTUS ABEL, BABT.,

READING FOR THE MILLION.
THE Pall Mall Gazette is so de-
lighted with Mr. SHATV-LEFEVBE'S
review of the Political Progress of
the last fifteen years, delivered at
Reading, that it suggests its being
circulated as a political tract by
Liberal Associations in all parts of
the Three Kingdoms. To be Shaw!
It will shortly be published,—
title, "The Story of Lefevre."
The same course will probably be
taken with Lord NOBTHBROOK'S
Bristol Addresses, — title, "A
Bristol Bird's-Eye View of the
Political Situation." Lord HAB-
TLNGTON'S coming campaign will
doubtless furnish materials for a
companion tract, to be called
"Cut Cavendish." The Tories
will then have plenty to " put in
their pipes" for some little time
to come.
SPOBTTNG MATCH.—A big fat
man, one of the Extra Stout
Division, and a cheeky little thin
youth were discussing pedestrian-
ism. The pigmy chaffed the giant.
"Good!" says Extra Stout.
"I '11 back myself to run against
you for a fiver I" "Done!"
cried Pigmy: "Where and when!"
"Here, and now!" replied the
Big Man. And he did run against
him. There wasn't much left of
the Pigmy after the first concus-
sion. He paid the "fiver," but
protested that it was "under
pressure."

[Breach of Promise Cote. Miller v. Joy, part heard.—On his Lordship
taking his'seat, the Jury complained of the draughts which they had expe-
rienced on the preceding day, on which his Lordship suggested that a eurtain
should be hung over the door leading into the jury-box, adding—"It was
some months before I could obtain curtains after applying for them, but at

Attendants. Several Queen's Counsel, with raging toothaches,
are angrily signalling for all windows to be closed.
Judge (sneezing violently, and addressing the Jury). And now,
Gentlemen, before we begin this morning's proceedings, in the inter-
esting Breach of Promise case which afforded such a display of
forensic wit yesterday, let me inquire of you how you like your
new seats'( 1 don't wish to take too much credit to myself, but I may
remark—(proudly)— that it was owing to my intervention that the
CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER has been induced to consent to the
expense entailed by what I may be allowed to call the user of a
warming-pan in tne Jury-box before you came into Court. Every
seat, I may add, is stuffed with the very finest feathers, taken from
a kind of fowl which is, I believe, indigenous in South Australia,
but which is also sometimes observed in the neighbourhood of these
buildings. It is called the Anser aliens, or Client Goose; and the
specimen, Gentlemen, which is now contributing to your bodily com-
fort was recently plucked by the kind assistance of one or two
Solicitors in the adjoining Hall.
Foreman of the Jury. My Lord, the only "anser"—(roars of
laughter)—I can make is to say, that in your Lordship's hands the
comfort of Jurymen and the welfare of litigants seem equally
secure.
Judge (complacently). It pleases me to hear yon say so. If there
is any other little matter which you wish attended to
A Juror. I have heard, my Lord, that "de minimis non curat
lex"—(uproarious laughter)—but I must beg leave to state that,
owing to the crowded condition of the Great Hall, a favourite corn
which I have cherished for many years—(murmurs of sympathy
from several Jurors)— was much trodden upon, and
Judge. Not another word! Usher! corn-plasters for one—for
half-a-dozen, if necessary! (Thoughtfully.) Some may call me
weak. Mr. CHILDERS. I know, will object to the expenditure. But
nobody shall ever say that I did not attend to the physical comfort of
Jurymen in my Court. Anything else?
Another Juror. My Lord, these 'ere Breach o' Promise cases make
a fellow hungry—also thirsty. I don't want to make no complaints
about the wittles, but our lunch yesterday
Judge (sadly). Gentlemen, it is as I foresaw. I have repeatedly
called Mr. GLADSTONE'S attention to the subject, and have even gone
so far as to order turtle-soup to be supplied to my table, if not to
your own, charging the cost to the general expenses of our Judicial
System. But these complaints are too much. I will—(weeping)—
to-day divide my own turtle-soup with your Foreman: and, Master!
—oh, would you kindly step down into the kitchen and see that the
Jurymen's chops are not burned; and perhaps some member of the
Junior Bar would not mind giving an eye to the mashed potatoes—I
merely throw out the suggestion as a dictum, and do not mean it to
become a precedent—Ah, thanks, Mr. McMnoonrs! very kind of vou,
indeed! And, oh, Mr. McMcooiNS, when you are in the kitchen,
would you mind just telling the cook (Whispers.) Yes, a leetle

THE MODERN ARS AMANDI.
(By. PuncJiius Naso.}
PBOEH.
PUNCHTUS, past Master of the Art of Arts,
Here to his friends, the British Fair, imparts
Love's latest lessons. Newer Naso he,
And nicer. Hark! girl-voices ripple free!
Arms and the Boy I sing-^-commingling fun
With warmth of a Mayfair Anaoreon.
Momus and modish Cupid hand in hand
Deal Love and Laughter round a listening land!
CANTO I.
THE MODERN CUPLD.
To arm the Amazons against the Greeks,
In days when blue-hosed BECKER boldly seeks
Penthesilea to
make para-
mount,
Might seem su-
perfluous toil,
did Cupid
count
Arms Amazonian
as his own;
but, no!
That oldest ben-
der of the lip-
shaped bow
As soon would
sling a Gatling
at his back.
Or with torpedoes
spread his
mazy track,
As, dropping his
own dainty-
feathcred
darts,
With LYDIA'S grey goose-quill assail our hearts.
War's weapons change, no longer lance-lines glint,
Breech-loaders supersede the primal flint,
But Eros, protean else in guise and garb,
The sweet simplicity of plume and barb
Maintains, ana, loyal to the archer-craft,
The modern Cupid shrills the ancient shaft.
The Modern Cupid! There's a thought, my Girls!
Through soft curved lips gleam out the serried pearls,
Betrayed in that slow subtle brooding smile,
_ Blending of rapt delight and blameless guile,
'Which ever greets the utterance of that name
In ear of damosel or youthful dame.
How shall one paint him? Age-old Infant he
Eternal adolescent, fresh and free
As when he played in Paphian air, at home
And native in fielgravia or in Rome,
Potent in Piccadilly as Japan,
Your only genuine Cosmopolitan.
"That word-of-all-work,—Love!" So read the Saga
In darkly deep Deronda's ponderous page,
And countering Cupid (Sage and boy are chums,
And wander oft where high Hymettus hums,
Bee-peopled, or where buzzings far less sweet
Lade the dense air of memory-haunted Fleet),
The twain, by draughts nectareous reinforced,
In free colloquial dactyls thus discoursed:—
Puxcnrus.
First of noun-substantives, nomen sublime and ecstatioal,
Once so serenely pre-eminent, proud, autocratical,
Hath it befallen so fatally, foolishly, funnily,
Thou in the shade, who didst lord it supremelv as sunnily?
Thou, on whom Beauty and Bravery showered joint benison,
Sunk to a sort of a " Slavey "? Though honey-tongued TENXYSON
Shows us voung Chivalry stooping to Cookery willingly,
Patient, though taunted by tip-tilted termagant thrillingly,
What is a Knight in the Kitchen to Love in the Scullery?
Thou, " word-of-all-work "? What destiny dreadfuller, duller? I
Fain must compassionate conquering Cupid, whom Rex I con-
-sidered, whatevtr his alias, of life, lip, and lexicon!
CUPID.
Words are but words, Sir. My power defieth paralysis,
Shrinks not from sharp inquisition, or subtle analysis.
Though 'tis applied by a critic of cuteness phenomenal,
Keenest of caustic pen-wielders, most wondrous of women all.
As for my name, fools will take it in vain; 'tis equational,
Many conceive, with the silly, or coarse, or sensational;
Certes their Algebra's crass and remarkably curious,
Love is their true " unknown quantity." Utterly spurious
Most of their pseudo-solutions. With purely chimerical
Statics of dulness, dynamics of fervour Hysterical,
Fain they would formulate Me; whom young ladies erotica!
Blindly excogitate out of crazed noddles chaotical.
Love laughs at libellous labelling, ludicrous counterfeit;
Modern Romance should go lave in the Muses' pure fount her feet,
Ere she come trampling, like Pan, o'er my lilies and crocuses.
My nectar's pure till some satyr the rosy draught hocusses.
Me would they scullionise, set me to sense as subordinate,
Slave to mere appetite, morbid or gross or inordinate?
Mammon, and MUDIE, and muek-a-fa-mode do not master all.
Once a queer quill-driver's craze, called, absurdly, the Pastoral,
Ruled it in modish Romance. I survived that stupidity;
So shall I sensual spasm and callous cupidity.
Making my name Word-of-all-work is using me scurvily;
But though Love's world—in three volumes—seems turned topsy-
turvily,
Trust me, my actual orb keeps its centre of gravity,
Spite of all word-spinning nights of fantastic depravity.
So Cupid in his chartered Laureate's ear,
Unchanged by folly as unchecked by fear,
Ready to tackle with his whims and wiles
PSYCHE of Greece or SUKET of St. Giles'.
Psyches are scarce. Would JULIA emulate
That much-afflicted maiden ?" Pas si bete!"
JULIA would say, she who would pipe no eye
Over the tender tropes of Mrs. TIQHE,
As might her grandmamma perchance have done,
In days ere cvnio " form" was thought good fun.
No moon-eyed maiden she with soft clasped hands
Shy lowered lids, soft pleats and snowy bands,
Such as in days ere OUIDA'S banner waved,
Soft STOTHAHD limned, bland BAETOLOZZI graved,
Blushfully yielding to the stumpy dart
A hovering Cupid twanged against her heart.
Erect, wide-lidded, carelessly composed.
JCLIA the firm of lip, cool, classic-nosed,
WoRTH-robed and WiNGFiELD-trained, the god confronts
With steady glance that his best arrows blunts,
Or would un-point them were Cythera's boy
A strategist so poor as to employ
Old wiles'that answered when the world was Greek,
And female wit had not invented chic.
Not so keen Eros errs. He conies not now
A chubby saiis-otlotte with curl-topped brow,
Plain bow and patent quiver. How P Perchance
Ho comes correct of garb and cool of glance,
Like ABTHUK, "as a modern Gentleman,"
But oftener, as befits a subtler plan.
In the receipt of fern-seed. Maids beware
Of the invisible Eros; his a snare
The wariest bird may haply fail to twig.
Cries JCIIA, with a moue, "how infra dig.
To be caught napping, captured ostrich-blind!
Let me but see his face and I '11 not mind."
Sage Puxcnrus smiles, a smile with meaning rife,
Which JULIA may not fathom for her life.
Then in the shell-pink ear of soft LOUISE
He whispcreth, "The Cupid whom one sees,
Beholds afar and waits for, as you wait
For laggard postman fumbling at the gate,
Is not the urchin who makes surest capture,
Means subtlest mischief, or brings rarest rapture.
You comprehend?" That faint rose flush replies,
And lights the lamps of scorn in JULIA'S eyes.
Dear demoiselles, your PUNCHTUS must lay down
His first of maxims. It may raise a frown,
And on the ears of modish matrons jar.
In lore much hangs on Cupi<fs ucatur,
Whether unasked and unannounced, he come
As to a sort of amorous " at home,"
Or, ticketed and touted for, appear
Liku any other " lion " of the year;
Whether with empty hands or plump portmanteau—
But for full explanation, sec next Canto!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

SO SIMPLE!
Proprietor of Furnished ffovsc. "You WILL OBSERVE, MADAM, THAT
THERE 19 EVKEY CONVENIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CASE OF FlRE,
YOU POP THROUGH THIS TRAP, AND THERE YOU ARE, YOU KNOW!"
LAYS OF A LAZY MINSTREL.
STILL IIN A BATH-CHAIR.
STILL in a Bath-chair!" Still so gently onward rolling!" People
don't seem to approve of 'my eye-glass. I suppose as an. invalid I
ought to wear blue goggles. "Bath-chairity begins at home." Of
course it does, but it doesn't end there. There are all soi-ts of little
adventures and excitements that serve to chequer the serenity of
your onward progress. I nearly crushed a goat-chaise full of babies
just now, I "poled" an eminent Author in the back, I went gently
over the corns of a Conservative Member of Parliament, I nearly
killed three pugs, and lamed a black poodle.
Sometimes, in passing another Bath-chair, ABLE gets into con-
versation with a brother dragger, and I find myself side by side
with a fellow sufferer, who looks somewhat angry. Query, how
should I behave? Should I say, "Hah! nice tine mornin'," in a
hearty jovial fashion, or should I say, "Hope I see you better, Sir,"
with a touch of tender melancholy in my voice. As I have never
seen the Gentleman before, as he looks very much as though he would
bite, I conclude it is better to say nothing at all, but feign to be
intensely interested in something in the offing until I have got well
clear of nim. I have met with a good many books of etiquette, but
never yet came across Rules for Behaviour in a Bath-chair. I sup-
pose, when people get to Bath-chairs, they are generally considered
to be past behaviour, good, bad, or indifferent.
But you certainly acquire an entirely new view of human nature,
and enjoy countless fresn opportunities of studying character. There
is something wondrously soothing in the semi-nautical roll of your
dragger, and the easy way in which you appear to drift along. The
hansom has been called the gondola of the London streets. I would
certainly christen the Bath-chair the "Punt of the Pavement."
Indeed, it has such a dreamy, gliding, puntesque character about
it that I quite long to have a ny-rod in my hand. I fancy I could
put a " palmer " or a " coachman " into the ear of that old gentleman
who is studying a newspaper, with tolerable certainty. And sup-
posing he made a dash right down the Esplanade, what sport I should
nave in playing him!
Feel as though I should like to smoke. Get out cigarette. Strike
a light several times. Wind blows it out. I yell to ABLE to stop.
I shout so loud that it frightens him, and he pulls up short, and very
nearly shoots me head-first over the leathern apron into a perambu-
lator full of twins. ABLE touches his hat, but evidently regards my
cigarette with distrust. Perhaps it is against the rules to smoke.
Possibly this is not a smoking-chair, and I shall be fined forty
shillings. Perchance I ought to smoke a cigar—if in a cab of course
I ought to smoke a Cabana—or, peradventure, a pipe. Of course a
Bath pipe. And if I want a little light refreshment. Bath buns and
Bath Olivers—singing " Rum-turn, tiddle, iddle, liddle, iddle!" &c.
As I get near the Pier I meet my noisy, hearty friend, SHOGGLE-
BACK. Ha! ha! ha!" he shouts in a voice which makes every-
body look round, and causes several fly-drivers to think they are
hailed. I hate SHOGGLEBACK because he is always so obstreperously
hearty. Heartiness is his profession and his practice—in point of fact
he is quite the hearty-culturalist. "Ha! ha! ha!" he shouts, nearly
wringing my hand off short at the wrist. "So like you, you know,
to be in a Bath-chair!" I calmly explain to my friend that it is
not in the least like me, that I have never in my life been in a Bath-
chair before. But he will have none of it. "Ho! ho! ho!" he
ejaculates, "you will have your joke! He! he! he! Splendid,
upon my word! Ha! ha! ha! The best thing I 've heard for a
lon<* while! I must go and tell KINCTJMBEH at once. He '11 roar.'"
And off he goes to tell KINCUMBER.
Who KJNCUMBEB is, I have not the least idea, but I am pretty
certain that my friend, instead of commiserating my unfortunate
position, is about to circulate the report that I am plaving practical
the passers-by regard me with pity not unmingled with fear.

DEAB ME. PUNCH,
LOOK here. Here are a couple of questions (there were a lot more of
them) that I had to tackle in a "General Intelligence Paper," at our school
the other day :—
"6. Mention gome fact connected with each of the following names :—GENSERIC,
MACSOLUS, DIOGENES, MICHAEL SCOTT, Lord BACON, RAVAILLAC, STRABO, IVAN THE
TERRIBLE, LOUISE MICHEL.
"8. Explain what is meant by ;—Crusted Port, A1, old Dresden, Alkaram, an heirloom,
nepotism, the survival of the fittest, abrasion of the cuticle."
I don't mean I want you to do them, you know; for I don't suppose you would
find out without a crib, as I did afterwards, that Ivan the Terrible was a Surrey
Melodrama in Five Acts, and that Lord BACON invented halfpenny squibs. All I
want you to do is to put this letter in, and let them know that I m not going to
be stumped, next half, and shall take precious good care to get well coached-up
in the right sort of things in the Christmas holidays.
I like that question about "Crusted Port." A 1! / thould rather think it
was; and if we had a dozen of it down here I dare say our form could polish off
that question about the " survival of the fittest" in no time. Here's one that
BAKER, Major, says is down for next term:—
"4. State all you know about Raised Pie, Dry Monopole, the Derby Favourite, Lords
and Commons (at the Haymarket), Dinner at the Holborn, Nap, CORNEY GRAIN, ALFRED
THE GREAT, and Oyster Suppers."
That's a stiff question—least some ef it—but the sort of thing one can get up
first-rate with a crammer, you know, and that's the way I mean to do it. So
please, Mr. Punch, let them know that however badly I 've been getting on with
Latin prose, 11 O.M F.U, and EUCLID, and all that old-fashioned rubbish, I 'm coming
to the fore at last; and if I don't floor the next paper—well, all I can say is,
I 'm not your much admiring and, henceforth studious, friend,
THE GENERALLY INTELLIGENT BOY.
A SIGH FROM THE SLUMS.
Do you hear the people weeping, oh, my brothers,
In this London of un-rest?
Do you see the tears downfalling from the mothers
On the babies at their breast?
The world is full of joy and exultation,
And the City throbs with pride,
The mighty and the magnates of the nation
Fling their riches far and wide;
But the poor, poor people, oh, my brothers,
You can see them crouching down,
Whilst the giddy whirl and noise of pleasure smothers
All the anguish of the Town!
Get vou forth from out your palaces, and visit
Where and whence the sorrow comes
Round the corner, not so very distant is it
To the stews and to the slums!
Just a stone's throw from your dwelling, see them lying
Naked, starving on the floor,
Infant cries amidst the groaning of the dying,
Whilst the Landlord guards the door.
Out of work and out of heart, but where's the pity
For a pauper bruised and bent?
Not one curse has fallen yet upon the City
That has murder to repent!
Day by day they rise and journey forth and wander
To tne work-yard and the Docks,
Slouching sadly past the millionnaires who squander,
And the fatalist who mocks:
And the women left behind them wear their fingers
To the sinew and the bone,
Working sadly, whilst November daylight lingers
Not for bread, but for a stone;
And the ragged children, huddled near their mothers,
Keep on starving in their cry.
Thus they live in tribulation, oh! my brothers,
Thus they mercifully die!
Grope your way up rotten staircases, and find them
By the dozen in a room.
'Tis but love and blind affection that can bind them
To this wretchedness and gloom.
See the mother round the dying cinders crooning,
See the father in despair,
See^the daughter in consumption—she is swooning
From the foulness of the air.
Hear the coughing and the crying and the groaning,
With the bare boards for a oca,
Get the heart-ache with their miserable moaning,
"Give us bread! oh, give us bread!"
Great possessor of the miserable hovel,
Where you hustle men like swinej
Have you never any pity when they grovel,
Pleading, praying off your fine?
Do you sleep in peace and know the rotten rafter
Falls in tilth on pauper heads?
No! you threaten execution first—and after
Sell their vermin-eaten beds!
Mighty Landlord, when you pass around the bottle
In the merry Christmas-time,
Does a spectre never rise at you and throttle
All your life out for your crime?
How long? How long? Oh, proud and mighty nation,
Will you coldly shut your ears
To this wailing cry of pain and tribulation
Welling up in London's tears?
Oh! how long to all this bitter crush of sorrow
Will you fasten up your door,
Putting off to an indefinite to-morrow
All your pity for your poor P
Have you comfort for yourselves and not for others?
Are you careless of the future and its fate P
In the name of great humanity, my brothers,
Is it London that must wait?

A protest was entered against Mr. RUSSELL LOWELL'S candidature for the

He was elected by a majority of 18 (100 against 82).

THE foes of "the competitive system " are having another pitch-
into their pet aversion in the pages of the Standard, under the
heading of "Questionable Questions." Of course we do not wish
our boys and girls to be either " crammed" into sapless " saps " or
catechised into "precocious prigs." Only to a "PRIVATE TUTOR"
who protests against the rigours of Public Examiners, an impartial
reader might be tempted to say :—
"Thou comcst in such a ' questionable ' shape."
THE French Republicans are determined that their Clergy shall go
to Heaven, no matter what becomes of themselves; that is, if .reducing
them to a state of practical poverty is a great step in this very right
direction. The Archbishop of PARIS has been gradually lightened of
his burdens, and from 100,000 francs has been just cut down to
15,000 francs; i.e., sue hundred a-year. He had better send over and
borrow a trine from Lambeth, as the Archbishop of CANTERBURY
has £15,000 per annum. Rather a difference between pounds and
francs, eh?
A BIG BILL.
THE following Advertisement appears in the various daily
papers:—
MR. HENRY IRVING, Miss ELLEN TERRY, and the Lvceum
Company, STAR THEATRE, NEW YORK. TO-NItfHT.—

Nine heavy pieces in one evening! Probably, even the vast
American appetite for the play must be satisfied by this time. But
we cannot exactly see how all these pieces can be compressed into one
evening. Probably it is done in the form of a drawing-room enter-
tainment, in which Mr. IRVING and Miss TERRY take their station
behind a couple of tables, and bob down and come up again as some-
body else every few minutes, after the fashion Mr. WOODIN
rendered popular. Meanwhile what are the rest of the Company
doing? Are they taking a holiday, or performing somewhere else?
It strikes us that all the large Company, their wardrobes, their wigs,
with the scenery and fittings, has been an unnecessary expense. The
Yankees would pay their money just as readily to see Mr. IBYING
and Miss TERRT in a drawing-room entertainment.
IN a daily paper we found this announcement:—
"Among recent'calls' to the Bar arc to be found the nomei of two gentle-
men who until lately were popular Clergymen."
This is inverting the Christian order, which is from the Law to the
Gospel. However, they can still say that they have had a distinct
"call."
A PUPIL of dear old Mr. Barlow writes to ask us, " Is there a College
of Sandford at Oxford?" No; we believe not. Only of Merton.
Of course this is unfair. There should be a Sandford and Merton
College, with a Master, Dr. BARLOW.

(A Handbook to Heady-made Oratory.)
PAST VI.—THE HOUSE OF LOBDS.
IT is a remarkable trait in the Anglo-Saxon race that every English-
speaking man has an inborn reasonless respect for the fortunate
bearer of a hereditary title; or, to put it briefly, " for ' Briton' read
'Flunkey.'" This characteristic in their fellow-countrymen is
extremely useful to the noble personages for whose benefit this part
of the Handbook is compiled. The one fact that a person is a Member
of the House of Lords is worth a hundred theories. At a public
dinner a representative of this illustrious body takes as a right,
which only a lunatic would pretend to dispute, a place far above the
most learned of Sages, the deyoutest of Divines, and the grandest of
Authors. His Lordship or his Grace has only to whisper that he it
a Lord or a Grace, to be ushered up with servile smiles to the high
table. It matters not that the banquet is being held in honour of
Literature, Art, or Science. The noble reveller may know absolutely
nothing about these subjects, and yet, upon the strength of his
hereditary title, he will be one of the chief ornaments at the board,
and will be obsequiously requested to speak. The other diners will
regard him, if they don't know him, with awe. and if they do, with
intense satisfaction. If he has an Order^has been given a Thistle,
or tendered a Bath—he will wear it. This, on the whole, will be a
mistake, as it will suggest the painting of the lily or the refining of
pure gold. Why should a Lord be decorated? Surely, his coronet
place* him on a pinnacle from whence he can regard the ambitions of
smaller creatures—if a Lord can be called a creature—with equa-
nimity, not to say contempt P Commoners receive ribbons, therefore
Noblemen should refrain from accepting them. Thus, it is far better
that the Peerage should remember the adapted adage that " Nobility
unadorned is adorned the most." However, as sometimes more than
one august personage appears at the high table, it may be as well
to jot down a few notes as to the appearance of some titled types, for
the benefit of unintelligent foreigners:—
The Duke of Ditchtcater.—Old man with a bald head and a large
vulgar mouth. Rather deaf, and fond of snuff, which he spills over
his shirt-front. Stammers when he speaks; and in replying to "The
House of Lords," is never (fortunately) heard beyond the Chairman.
Norman ancestor was a thief, and his own great-grandmother
happened to be a washerwoman.
fl\e Earl of Mudlarking.—Jewish-looking middle-aged man, with
watery eyes and whitey-brown hair and whiskers. Very dull and
stupid. Is married, and has a large family of children. Wife most
amiable person. In spite of this, is himself a great " patron of the
Drama" (Frivolity Theatre Branch), and is partial to bachelor
parties at Richmond. Never spoke half-a-dozen words to an audience
in public in his life, and never dines at a charity dinner except on
the condition that he shall not be asked to furnish a post-prandial
oration. Consequently, not nearly such a fool as he looks. Heraldic
coat—beautifully decorated bar sinister on the national arms. Genea-
logy—descended, rather indirectly, from the daughter of a chimney-
sweep in the time (very much the time) of the Stuarts.
Lord Lo»ibardball.—y0b\e Masher. Fond of " Chappiw." Son of
serious father. All collar, cuffs, and white waistcoat. Quite ready
to make a speech after dinner, but then runs all his syllables into a
single word, and smiles inanely. Great-great-great-grandfather was
a favourite pawnbroker of WILLIAM THE THIRD.
The list might be extended, but the above types are general. With
certain exceptions (and in the roll of exceptions will be happily
found some of the brightest intellects of the nation) our hereditary
title-bearers in the "Upper House" have sprung from soldiers of
fortune, " sharp" tradesmen, " smart" Lawyers, or Ladies of humble
birth. This raw material has been rehned by generations of
Eton and the Universities; but, in spite of this, the residuum very
frequently gives unmistakable evidence of its rather coarse origin.
The "common "features, the shop-counter simper, the stunted
artisan figure all tell of extremely plebeian blood. But then these
are lost sight of in the glamour of high rank. An Earl, if he in an
Earl, looks every inch an Earl, in spite of his squint, and a Duke, if
he is a Duke, appears to be specially worthy of a coronet with the
regulation strawberry leaves, even though his finger-nails do not
strongly testify their owner's enthusiastic love of personal cleanliness.
There is a motto which every Peer is supposed to adopt as a rule of
life—noblesse oblige. It is presumed that every bearer of a heredi-
tary title, carrying with it a right to receive numberless Blue Books
published at the expense of the Public, is willing, in virtue of his
position, to please everyone. Now it gratifies the community at
large to hear a Peer talking in public, and, as some Peers cannot talk
in public, it may be as well to give the specimen of the sort of speech
which would cause unlimited satisfaction in all quarters but the
highest. Of course, the imaginary speaker is a myth—a foolish but
frank Lord, with the courage of his opinions. Should such a person,
however, be found, there would be no doubt about his popularity—
again, in certain circles. It must be remembered that, as the speaker
would be 'a Peer addressing Commoners, all his Lordship's remarks
would be received with the deepest approval.
Noble Orator (rising at the right of the Chairman). Gentlemen—
(enthusiastic applause)—I am sure I must thank you for the honour
you have conferred upon me. (" No, no.'") Yes, it is an honour,
because I believe I am verily the most uneducated dolt in all this
brilliant assembly. (Cheers.) I am, indeed: and, although a great
many of my peers—perhaps the majority—are highly respectable,
still in my class you will discover many who resemble me in nearly
every particular. (Applause.) As a lad I refused to learn anything,
and could scarcely spell my name—certainly it was a long one—at
fifteen. (Great cheering.) I was a dunce at school, and a cad at the
University. (Frantic enthusiasm.) It is my great pride to remem-
ber that at this latter seat of learning I had the honour to burn half
the College library, and to screw up the door to my tutor's apart-
ments. (Hoars of laughter.) But from this you must not imagine
that I am fond of squandering. On the contrary, I audit my [own
butcher's book, and superintend the store-cupboard of my Lady's
housekeeper. (Cheers.) I never go by a cab when I can take
an omnibus, and if asked for a shilling by a genuinely starving
beggar, would, after mature consideration, advance him a Halfpenny
on account, chargeable on approved security. (Cheers.) And yet I
am very rich, enormously rich. (Renewed applause.) Many of the
slums of the greatest city in the world belong to me. (Chttrs.) And
although alums are not pretty to look at or live in, they are good

ones to pay. (Shaute of enthusiasm.) From this slight confession
you may imagine that I am ignorant, vicious, mean, and grasping.
(Prolongedcheering.) Well, I am all three, and more, for I am an ass
into the bargain. (Thunders of applause.) Besides this, I have no
birth to boast of. A hundred years ago or so, my great-grandfather
swept a crossing, and his wife dealt in hare and rabbit-skins. But
what matter the past when we have the present before us! I am
crassly ignorant and intolerably offensive, but I am a Lord. (Enor-
mous enthusiasm.) And, as a Lord, I can give you what laws I
please—(" You can; yott can.'")—or never go near the House of
Lords from one year's end to another. I generally adopt the latter
course, except when the interest of my_ own class, or the gratification
of a fad, cause me to perform my highly responsible duties. On
these occasions, however, I take care that I represent none but myself.
(A storm of applause.) Under these circumstances, as I am bored out
of my life, and have just enough sense to see that I am a nuisance to
everyone, inclusive of myself, I am sure you are glad that you are
not me. Jfoblesse oblige, I want to console you! (The noble speaker
here resumed his seat amidst the wildest enthusiasm.)
Such a speech as the above would, no doubt, reconcile many
listeners to cease to envy the Peerage, the more especially if they
happened to be either Baronets of JAMES THE FIRST'S creation or
members of the oldest (not the mushroom) county families.
A GREEN OLD AGE?
THE Corporation of the City of London is, as we all know, for we
are informed of the important fact by the Right Honourable the
LORD MATOE about three times a week, a very ancient institution, it
therefore naturally sympathises very keenly with everything that is
old, not forgetting such minor matters as old port and old customs.
The LORD MAYOR himself is an ancient institution, being very nearly
seven hundred years oldj and his numerous speeches breathe of
reverence for age, and defiance to change. The Lord Mayor's Show
is an ancient institution, and gallantly Dears aloft its many banners
against the battle and the breeze of Metropolitan chaff, and Metro-
politan sarcasm. The Jews are an ancient people, and the Corpora-
tion naturally sympathises with the Gentlemen of the Hebrew per-
suasion, and having heard of the existence of a highly favourable
specimen of that—certainly not persecuted, but, on the contrary,
rather highly favoured race—especially in one very important feature
—who has attained the very unusual age of ninety-nine, they at once
determined to do him honour.
A member of the Common Council of the name of LEVERAGE,
wanting possibly a little more leverage to raise him to notoriety, if
not to fame; moved the Court to pass a vote, not of sympathy, but of
congratulation to the Jewish Gentleman on having lived for so long
a period. There certainly seems rather an appearance of oddity about
such a proceeding as that of congratulating a man on being so very
old, but as the motive was doubtless a good one we will pass that by.
Here one would naturally have thought the matter would have ended,
but, as the LORD MAYOR so continually and kindly reminds us, the
Corporation is an ancient institution, and does things in its own old-
fashioned way. So the Resolution was, what is called, "fairly
transcribed and emblazoned," which means, we believe, for of course
we speak under correction, that surrounding the inscription would
be painted the coats-of-arms of the City of London, of Sir MOSES,—
what a curious combination it seems—of the LORD MAYOR, and of all
and every of the other persons engaged in the matter, for which room
could be found.
And now came the difficulty which had possibly been foreseen by
the originators of the idea. How was the magnificently emblazoned
Resolution to be presented'( Common-place people might have sug-
gested that if it was of too valuable a character to be entrusted to the
tender mercies of a Railway Company, one of the numerous staff of
Corporation Officers might nave been spared for one day, from his
numerous duties, to have accompanied it.
But these Common Councilmen are not common-place people, and
the Corporation is an ancient institution, so it was determined that a
certain Committee, of which the mover of the Resolution is Chair-
man, should go to Ramsgate, en masse, and make the presentation in
due form. We have no means of knowing the number of Corpora-
tors this included, but we certainly hope they had a fine day for
their pleasant sea-side trip, and were entertained with that bounte-
ous hospitality for which Sir MOSES is somewhat celebrated, and
which no class of HER MAJESTY'S loyal subjects can better appre-
ciate than the members of the Ancient Corporation of the City of
London.
WHEN an English Star, even as a lesser light, visits America, her
appearance is hailed with enthusiasm by Public and by Critics. But
when an American Actress visits us, it seems that our Theatrical
Critics are unable to dissociate the Stars from the Stripes—which
they administer pretty freely.

tickets at the last moment, seeing the piano safe in, and scurrying
right and left all over the place after my hundred-and-one traps. I
just managed to catch the 9'15, as " particularly requested," on the
A.D.V., and got down here, as fit as a lark and twice as lively, in
regular slap-up time. Vita brevis—Ars longa, it it? The longer

will ask him in to-night to have a little music and social fireworks,
and try those thundering good cigars I got at BURGON'S. I wonder

he '11 know how to draw a badger. Ha! ha! Tell him that, too!

Saturday.—The week is over,—and yet—I have no wish to return
to the Metropolis for the purpose of enjoying that little occasional
mental dissipation in the giddy vortex sanctioned and acknowledged
by the Draconian but admirable regulations of this establishment!
Am I then an altered man? Has the "experiment" succeeded? I
think it has! Let me recall the few scattered but striking incidents
of .this eventful week. On Tuesday they took away my Chickering,
my cigars, a beautiful tweed suit with a yellow stripe, and one of my
dogs. I offered to fight HERKOMER, but he declined. Then I grew
thoughtful. On Wednesday they confiscated my favourite, Flobbs—
and the oyster-supper I had ordered from RULES' was sent back to
town again by the 10'17;—all this while I was partaking of a sweet
artistic tea of toasted buns with the Vice-Principal and a few
favourite and selected Students. We did not talk of much, indeed,
we talked of nothing—and the buns were cold; but I felt the influ-
ence of the place as I was conducted home to bed, at our retiring
hour, a quarter to nine, and I began to think that Art, pursued for
"Art's sake," was something I had not yet distinctly understood. I
had a toothache all the night, and I think I rose an altered man. I
began to feel the beauty of this guided humble life. The next day
we had rice pudding for our dinner. This saddened me, but in the
afternoon we walked, the four-and-thirty of us, two and two, as far
as Colney Hatch. They would not let us in,—so we came back! Then
we played humming-top and marbles in the rich green pasture of the
little Romanesque Cloister,—not for money, but for love;—and so
ended the simple story of another earnest but artistic day. What
shall I say of Friday? Up in the dark at half-past three (here we
are advanced to models, and never draw the line), I worked for
seventeen simple hours at one simple stretch till,—as if in some
waking dream I seemed to see the all-gentle HERKOMER take up a
nine-foot easel in both hands but why continue? Saturday is
here—and, _ah, well, if worst had come to worst, it would have been

UNJUST RATES!
ME. PUNCH has been requested by a poor puzzled Ratepayer to
throw his eagle glance upon what is technically called "the inci-
dence of taxation as regards Rates." Mi: Punch's own income being
of that fabulous amount that his only difficulty is to know how to
spend it, of course so trifling a matter as Rates never crossed his
mighty mind. In fact, he was in regard to them much as CRTJIK-
... , , But being always willing
to unravel a mystery, or probe an injustice, where the interests of his
poor fellow-citizens are concerned, he has complied with the request
above alluded to, and has thrown his eagle glance upon the matter of
Rates, and he discovers it to embody such an abominable system of
injustice, if not iniquity, as fills his indignant soul with almost
unspeakable wrath!
Take the rich City of London as an example. Nearly every foot of
the freehold of the City belongs to wealthy City Companies or to
wealthy men, rich beyond the dreams of avarice. It is often found
necessary to expend enormous sums of money in widening the streets
to accommodate the ever-increasing traffic. Every such improve-
ment largelv increases the value of the neighbouring property. But
who pays for such improvement? Mark the abominable injustice
of the system. Not the wealthy owner of the improved property, but
the poor hard-working occupier! But even that is not all. The
poor Ratepayer has first to pay for all the cost of the improvement;
secondly, ne has to pay a largely increased Rent for the property he
has paid to improve; and, thirdly, he has to pay increased Rates
upon his increased rental. Anything more shamefully unjust, or
more artfully contrived, was never invented by the cutest American
of Jewish extraction.
The grasping Landlord sits quietly by, smiling at the ever-
increasing: value of the property he never contributed one shilling to
improve, while the poor occupier finds more and more of his small
inoome required to meet the ever-increasing calls upon him for a
Rate, from which he derives no kind of advantage. The only solu-
tion of this almost incredible state of the law is, that the Legislature
consists almost entirely of Landlords, who apparently rejoice in
devising laws whose evident effect must be to make the idle and rich
owner much richer, and the hard-working and comparatively poor
occupier much poorer. The only chance of obtaining1 a remedy for
this gross injustice is the formation of a Ratepayers' Association,
with the object of insisting ;that all Rates for the improvement of
property should be paid by the rich owners who get all the benefit
from the improvement, and not by the poor overweighted occupiers
who get none.
To show, too, how this Landlord-greed increases the difficulty of
improving the dwellings of the Poor, Mr. Punch learns from the
City Press that the cost of clearing away two City Rookeries that
were condemned as unfit for human habitation, and which were
inhabited by less than three thousand people, has cost no less a sum
than £270,000. Of this amount probably about three-fourths would
go to the Landlords of these shameful hovels, being nearly £70 per
head—man, woman, or child—of the occupants, or, for a small family
of five persons, £350; which would seem to show that the poor crea-
tures who inhabited these filthy dens must, on an average, have paid
rent equal to about two shillings per head per week, or, in the case
above alluded to, ten shillings per week. Of course, too, the more
Rent these Vampires sucked out of their poor miserable tenants the
more compensation they received from the City Authorities, and the
heavier Rates the City Ratepayers had to pay.
No doubt these grasping Landlords prefer to do their deeds by
stealth, and.would probably blush to find them fame; but, never-
theless, Mr. Punch would strongly recommend that their names and
addresses should receive that publicity they so richly deserve.

"Ah, a very valuable book, no doubt. I am told she is one of the

THE LATEST CRAZE.
(Letters from a young Gentleman of Fashion who "Adopted the Stage as
a Profession.")
Mr DEAB DUCHESS, 28- Shrimp Street, Shellford.
Now I '11 just tell you something about the dressing-rooms.
They are not similar to " the Beudoirs of the Nobility" in any one
particular. I arrived at the Theatre about 6'30 P.M., with GEOBOE,
long before anybody else had come. (How dismal a Theatre looks
when it's all dark and empty!) The old charwoman with the cold
was just thinking of lighting up (she begins to think ten minutes
before she does a thing, I 've now found out). "Which is my dress-
ing-room?" I asked her. "Jd'no," she said, " suppose you 're with
some o' the Gents, and the Gents all dresses in the basement. Names
writ on the door. 'Is dressing-room!" she chuckled to herself.
"E '11 'aye to get out of them 'tis down 'ere,—things is more hother
people's in this place!" What she meant I don't know. GEORGE
and I stumbled down a precipitous staircase in the dark, and after
groping about for a time at the imminent danger of breaking our
legs, we came upon a door on which was written—" Mr. GABRICK,"
"Mr. DEBWENTWATER," "Mr. EXCELSIOR McALPiN."
"Ah, GEOBOE, here we are," said I, as pleasantly as I could, and
here we certainly were, in a little room about ten feet long and six
broad. Along one side was a deal table, and there was nothing else but
an old broken chair in the room; at each end of the table was heaped
a dirty mass of soiled linen, and a few stumps of wig-paste. The
centre of the table was clear. "I wonder why they 've cleared the
middle of the table, GEORGE," said I. "I don't wonder why at all,"
he replied, slowly. "The fire's one end o' the room and the gas is
the other, and there ain't nothing in the middle, so you 've got to
dress there." I 'm sorry GEORGE is going, and yet he depresses me.
I 'm determined not to give way, and GEORGE'S melancholy and pity-
ingexpressions unnerve me.
We've had a hard day— all the afternoon I've been looking out

pu a ne up . . buyi
was obliged to get some help from the Macready stock Miss
POSTER had referred to. GEORGE has helped me, but he 's been very
solemn about it. I don't feel in the same position with him as 1
do at home; and then this morning the men in ulsters called Ai>n
"Sir," and me " Old Chap." Yet you know these people are Actors
just as much as I am. I mean as I am trying to be, though of course
they are not a bit like the " selections " who used to come to your
Evenings. I wonder if it's like this in other professions? In the
Army for instance? or the Church? Well, in the Church, perhaps,
because there are Beadles, and Clerks, and Churchwardens, though
I am not sure if these regularly belong to the clerical profession.
I left myself and GEORGE in the dressing-room, each holding a big
bundle of clothes. GEORGE was right about the table. The fire too*
one end of the room, and the gas (with an old cracked glass hung
round the burner) the other; but I'd got a beautiful "make-up"
of my own, with a nice glass, every sort of paint and powder and
wig-paste, and also a little reading-lamp to nelp me to_ see. And
now the old .Charwoman had finished thinking about lighting the
gas, and had really done it, and I heard whistlings, and jokes, and
titters overhead, so I knew the company were arriving. "I think
you 'd better go, GEORGE," I said; "there won't be room for four of

us here; and, besides, it might be a bad precedent. If both the
other Gentlemen brought their servants, we should be six in the
room, or about a square foot a-piece." "Ah! they won't bring no
servants," said GEORGE, contemptuously. I don't like my own
servant looking down on me. or rather on my companions in Art. If
they were all Clergymen or Barristers robing in this room, would he
be the same? Somehow—I don't think so. There's something
wrong here somehow.
GEORGE is gone, and Mr. DERWENTWATER has arrived. He's been
bustling about the room a good deal, and using bad words to himself,
but he doesn't notice me. (I 'm getting myself up for the Coachman,
and practising my dialect, so I "m quite busy.) "What's the
matterP" I venture at last. "Everything's the matter!" is all
the change / get.
Then arrives Mr. GARRICK, and I should like to give you a taste of
the conversation between provincial " Pros." I enclose a glossary—
"Pros" means " Professionals;" "Screw " is their salary; " Taking
the Biscuit" is acting well; "Juggins" is a person unacquainted
with Stage-life—(I am a "Juggins" at present)—and lots more I
can't remember. But you may imagine, from my letter, what plea-
sant, gentlemanly fellows I have for companions.
"Overture and beginners, please!" says the Stage Manager out-
side._ (There isn't a call-boy.) The Stage Manager does everything,
ind is responsible if anything goes wrong. If the gas flickers, it s
bis fault; and so it is if a child cries in the Gallery. (Poor man! I
<nust get his son into the Bluecoat School.) Directly " Overture and
beginners!" was called, Mr. GARRICK and Mr. DERWENTWATER both
began_to dress, and complain bitterly, "It's just the same every
blooming night. A man can't have five minutes to himself, but he's
?ot to hurry, and drive, and dress himself, just when he's talking
ausiness." I 'm dressed. '' How do you like me as the Coachman?"
I ask. Mr. DEBWENTWATER (who is using my wig-paste to see if
it's good) don't answer. Mr. GARRICK (who don't like my range, but
rats up with it Jill he gets his own famous stuffj'off " old JACK

WATER. And with this remark I have to leave them. "Have you
got your dialect P" says the Stage Manager. "I really don't know,"
is my answer; "but I think Mr. GARRICK has it: he s kindly using
most of my things." "Now, then, Mr. McALPiw, get into the
corner, and begin your regrets in the Lancashire brogue, if you
please," says Miss POSTER, sharply.
No more to-day. I think I 'm getting on in my profession, though
I am afraid I shall be a " Juggins " for some time to come. "No
matter !" (as we say in melodrama) I suppose HENBY IRVING was
once a " Juggins " himself. Yours very truly,

THE MODERN ARS AMANDI.
(By Punchius A"<wo.)
CANTO II.
THE COMING OF CUPID-
How would you hare him come, this Protean god?
Silk bond, steel fetter, rosy chain, or rod,

All are hig gifts. JULIA would bid him bring
Much more than roses, raptures, and a ring.
No Phoebus-fronted Detrimental gleama
As lode-star of her unromantio dreams.
Beauty loves Bullion. JULIA knows its power,
The willing Danae of the aureate shower.
Then, JULIA, waste no dance, no moonlight stroll
On that soft myth, "affinity of soul."
Lavish no lash-veiled glance of those keen eyes,
Shoot, fair toxophilite, for the first prize;
Get home on the right target, then bend bold
The bow. draw to the head, and hit the gold!
No interludes of arrowy play to test
The starched and snowy mad of the male breast.
Do eagles hawk for butterflies? No doubt,
In those green days ere JULIA was "out,"
The lawny level and the sharp-fought " sett"
Saw more than spheres shoot o'er the tense-drawn net;
Saw untrained glances, and unguarded smiles,
Artless inveiglements, and simple wiles.
Do you remember, JULIA, when the musk
Of June's glad roses tilled the verdant dusk
Of all that " dear old garden" down in Devon?
What time a carpet-dance was instant heaven,
And some mad boating frolic rarer sport
Than the concentred glamour of the Court,—
Do you remember, dare you recollect,
Ere you had learned to reason, weigh, reflect,
Like an unmoony shrewd ahe-Ifamlet, how
You pulled the curls upon a boyish brow,
And swore, sweet girlish gusher, that their gold
Was more than Midas-touch could make?
But hold!
An ingfmie of seventeen—so much ?—
Might not appraise the value of that touch.
Now you know better, nor artillery waste
In tender thoughtlessness, or amorous haste.
That "dear old garden "? Pooh! a slow, dull spot,
Where you so "spooned,"and RUPEHT talked such'' rot"-
(RuPEKi's own word, boys will talk slang,)—absurd!
When the World called, you met it " like a bird "—
(RUPERT again !) And RUPEET? Oh! he 's gone
As—something small and shoppy—to Ceylon;
And you are angling for a Peer—they say so—•
And listening to the tips of Prxcirtus NASO.
So Cupid comes to you. That old mad fun
Was not the work of Aphrodite's son.
Of course! Methinks I see the urchin now,
Demure, and meaning business; oil his brow
Close serried lines, and cool eyes, clerkly, clear,
With—can it be, a pen behind his ear'(
That liints of settlements. Receive him so,
Fair JULIA; let Mm take his gleam and glow
To lackadaisical LOUISE. Chide not.
The goose-quill that signs cheques sans halt or blot
Is better than a feather from his wings,
That scrawls in violet ink of such vain things,
As cots and kisses, since, for all bards' pother,
You can't live in the one nor on the other.
Hear Cupid's confidences thereanent,
Cupid the champion, here, of Cent.-per-cent.,
The sworn appraiser, not of golden locks
And silvery laughter, but of Shares and Stocks:—
CUPID'S CONFESSION.
I dwelt in a cottage, a cottage ornee,
With two newly-meshed doves for a year and a day;
For a year and a day. till the newly-meshed doves
Stooped from " bliss to—Cabanas and ten-button gloves.
Aye me, the chill lapse! So a river may run
To the icy-bound North from the land of the Sun,
When the fuel that fed the sigh-furnaces failed,
AMANDUS so cooled, and AMANDA so paled.
Thy moustache curled as trimly, AMANDUS, but oh!
With how much less of sweetness the lips curled below.
AMANDA'S blue eyes, still twin amethyst spheres,
Looked so much less, bewitching their lids red with tears.
I was there. Could I help them with vow or with verse,
As she drew the last coin from her satin-lined purse,
Leaving more gold without than within? I was there—
At the window—when Butcher descended from prayer
To imperative rude objurgation; and when
Poor AMANDA first learned that " the sweetest of men"
Could be bitter of speech! I was there, though outside,
When AMANDUS first used naughty words to his bride.
/ 'd no gold. Could I mend with a rose or a dart
That terrible fracture, a flaw in the heart P
Could I bid shallow Passion, once stagnant, flow on,
When the fountain was choked, and all current was gone?
Could I help them who floated in rapture's mad round,
Breast to breast, whilst the footway was flowery, but found,
When occasion arose to endure or console,
That he had not a heart, and she had not a soul?
Could I aid those who Poverty hailed without fear,—
At a pretty safe distance, but when he drew near,
And displayed rather more of the wolf than the dove,
Making calls upon courage as well as mere love,
Fotind not rosy bliss, but abandonment utter,
In "Love in a Cottage"—without bread-and-butter?
"All are not Julias;" lisps a rosv maid
To PUNCHIUS prattling in his cedar's shade; •
"Some few of us love Cupid as of old,
Before he tipped his tiny darts with gold."
True, watchet-eycd bewilderer of sage brains,
And PUNCHIUS writes for all. If other gains
Thau golden ones inspire the maiden's breast,
And lure her through love's labyrinthine quest;
If—foolish child!—six feet of manhood straight
And an unwriiikled skin—and heart—have weight
More than joint bulk of coronet and pocket,
Linked with a soul that's burning to its socket;—
Why, then.—dear me !—the ever verdant sage
Combines the Augustan and Arcadian age
In his orb-wide experience; yet to teach
Maxims of Arcady in Mayfair speech
Seems like attempting with swift steel-cased shot
To gain admittance to Sabrina's grot.
Lend Punch your pocket-mirror, gay-lipped Grace!
Ah! lily-fingers seek the well-known place
With unsophisticated speed. What fun!
(JULIA would vow she never carried one)
Now look within. Lips cool and cheeks a-blush!
Teach those to glow, let these forget to flush
If you 'd compete with JULIA. But, bright elf,
If you seek love, not lovers, be yourself.
So front the tricksy god, so meet his eye
With radiant hope, too honest to be shy,
Own you have heard of him, heard, oh! a lot,
And wish to know him, as what girl would not?
You '11 find the Protean one put off his wig,
His clerkly airs, his looks austere and big,
His chic, his coolness, and his cynic slang,
And he the boy whose limpid laughter rang
In Paphos till e'en frolic Aphrodite
Would chide the urchin for a flight too flighty.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CATTLE-SHOW WEEK.
By Dumb-Crambo Junior.

Stt-ers.
Beat Butter.
Cross Bred.
A CRITICAL POSITION.
LAST week Claudian was to have been produced at the Princess's, and the Critics
had, we believe, been invited to witness a dress-rehearsal, but in consequence of what
the Times' Theatrical .Reporter would call the "unpreparedness" of the Earthquake,
with which Mr. BAHHETT was to have "brought down the house," the production was
postponed.
To invite the Critics to a dress-rehearsal is in the interests of Dramatic Art a great
mistake, though probably not for the Manager and Author, who can avail themselves
of such an exceptional opportunity by acting as Judges, and explaining to the Jury of
Critics why such and such an effect isn't as right as it might be, and of pointing out
the vast amount of trouble, outlay, time and talent which may have been expended
on the new piece, whatever it is.
On such an occasion the Manager and Author could both diplomatically ask advice,
express themselves most grateful for any hints that their learned friends in front
plight give, knowing very well that nothing their learned friends could say would
induce them to alter at the last moment any of the carefully planned details, but
perfectly aware that the best and shortest way of winning a Critic's good opinion is
to humbly listen to the suggestions that may fall from his lips, as though they were
invaluable instructions from some Mighty Master.
We have before us a pamphlet entitled Clnudian, being a few notes on the archi-
tecture and costume of the new piece, in the shape of a letter written by Mr. E. W.
GODWIN, F.S.A., to " My dear BAHRETT," in which the well-informed writer instructs
the apparently ignorant Manager, as to the interesting details of the period, A.D.
860-460, which, he says, is " almost a blank in the modern history of Art —and then
Mr. Gopwis, in a series of illustrations, (does he always write such letters with so
many pictures ?) proceeds to draw this blank.

my boy, yours trustfully, W. BARRETT.
_ If, instead of this letter, or if, with this letter as preface, we had been presented
with a book of the play about to be acted,—it could not be sold, as the American
acting-right would be thereby destroyed, my dear BARRETT (A.D. 1883-1884),—we
should have been better pleased, holding, as we emphatically do, that the book of any
new play ought to be in every Critic's hands at least a week before production, so
that he may know what he is going to see, and, as with a Shakspearian, or any other
stock-piece, have a standard by which he can measure the performance.
As it is, when a Critic goes to a premiere,—a night wnich is, as a rule, all clique
and claque,—he has, as a matter of course, to pronounce upon the dish set before
him. It may not be to his taste, and then he has to ask himself, "Why is this? Is
the acting bad? Have I really seen the piece as the Author intended it to be played?"
And. again, instead of expressing any sympathy with a Manager and Actors who
have uncongenial parts," or who have parts "unworthy of their talents," and so
forth, why does not the Critic ask, plainly and straightforwardly, "What on earth
induced a Manager of Mr. Sp-and-So's experience, to choose such a piece as this (what-
ever it is)?" The Critic invariably writes as if the Tyrant Author had compelled
the suffering Manager to produce his piece, and even to play in it himself.
Censure the play, by all means, when you have ascertained what the play is,
but censure also the Manager for placing it, if evidently bad, before the public. If
the Manager was doubtful, and the Author doubtful and inclined to risk it, then if the
Author had provided the Critics with the book of the piece, the play would be judged
on its own merits, if any, and a fair criticism could then be made on the acting,
decorations, and so forth. If it occurs to the Jury that Manager and Author must
have " a tile off" to have produced between them such a piece, then there are plenty
of hands ready and willing enough to supply the defect with good powerful " slating."
Musical Critics'take care to know the score pretty
well by heart before hearing a new Opera, and
then they follow it with a book in front of them.
Why should not the Dramatic Critics do likewise,
and why not refuse to witness any piece until it
should have been played three or four times?
SOMETHING LIKE A SCHOOL!
(An Extract from a Pupil's Diary.)
6 A.M.—Got out of bed, and made a rush for
Old KNIGHT'S door. Old KNIGHT is the master
of our form. Shouted at him through the key-
hole, and arranged a booby-trap with the coal-
scuttle and a large can of water. But he sold us
by letting himself down into the garden from the
window, by tying his blanket, sheets, and coun-
ter pane together. However, fortunately caught
sight of him when he was dangling in the air, and
pelted him with tooth-brushes.
8 A.M.—Breakfast. Informed Old KNIGHT that
there was a balloon, and asked him to look at it.
When he turned his head, we deluged him with
coffee and toast-crusts. Spent rest of recreation
hour in making slides out of the butter-dish.
10 A.M. to 12 NOON.—At Study. Most of us
reading novels, the remainder playing at dumb-
crambo. Fried sausages, as usual, while Old
KNIGHT was working the pon$ asinonim for us on
the black-board. When we had finished our lun-
cheons, some of us escaped by the window, ;and
the remainder by the chimney.
2. P.M.—Dinner. The usual game of pelting
Old KNIGHT with bits of potatoes, and filling his
pockets with rice-pudding. Poured the beer into
the Head-Master's coal-scuttle. This last feat
got us into a row. We are sentenced to stay at
school during the Christmas holidays—Old KNIGHT
is to remain with us to keep us out of mischief.
4 P.M. to 6'30 P.M.—More lessons, and this time
toffee-making. Head-Master came in, and find-
ing BILLY POTTEE standing on his head on Old
KNIGHT'S desk, kept us all in during tea-time.
After this we all communicated our ideas" to
BILLY POTTEBJ and coloured his eyes beauti-
fully. Old KNIGHT rather disgusted at having
to mind us instead of getting his tea.
9'15 P.M.—In our dormitory at last. Saw that
the place was all right for the night. Screwed up
all the doors belonging to the masters' rooms, piled
up all the class-books on the kitchen fire, and
emptied the contents of the beer barrel into poor
Old KNIGHT'S wardrobe. Then, having driven the
cow into the best drawing-room, and the sow and
her little piggies into the parent's reception par-
lour, got into bed. As I fell off to sleep, reflected
that on the whole, I had found out the way to
enjoy a happy day, and wondered if Old KNIGHT
had been as fortunate.
A APROPOS of Christmas Amusements, should
anyone happen to mention such matters at this
time of year, you may say that the game of cards
called "Merry Matches," issued by Messrs.
WYMAN, is a good all-rounder, and very much in
Young Folks' wavs. The Merry Matches are in
their own box, which, by the way, may be used
as an excellent substitute for a cigarette case. So
deal out the merry harmless cards, pour out the
Champagne, arrose tin pen pour ks petits, and let
the toast be " Wine and WYMAN!"
A SCRAP of Paper, it is said, is to be revived
at the St. James's soon after Christmas. As long
as a theatre is doing genuinely good business, the
Management would object even to a Scrap of
"Paper " in the house. The reason for the non-
idoption of the electric light at the St. James's is
because they have hitherto found Kendal-light
sufficient. If this theatre has been, as we htar,
recently treated to a little extra ventilation, it
was in consequence of the demand from the public
f or "More Hare!"

"THE PLAY'S THE THING!"
THAT nothing short of an educational revolution was inevitably about to
burst upon the University, must have been evident to everybody who had
an opportunity of attending the several performances of The Birds given at
Cambridge during the course of the past week. Sober Heads of Houses who
have hitherto shuddered at the GEBMAN REED'S Entertainment, and Learned
Professors who have only once or twice seen a Gaiety Burlesque on the sly,
could be noticed in shoals on the steps of the theatre convulsed with verve and
merriment, while freely admitting to each other in groups, that nothing could
withstand the all-encroaching dramatic spirit of the age, ana that in the future
the footlights must take their proper position at the Universities as a great
educational factor. It is not a matter of surprise, therefore, that no time has
been lost in the organisation of some scheme calculated to give a practical shape
to the fervid convictions of the moment. The following brief account of an
influential meeting on the subject, held only yesterday afternoon, shows at a
glance how rapidly matters are already progressing.
On the assembling yesterday at the door of the Senate House of the various
Heads of Houses, Professors, Tutors, and others interested in the "New
Dramatic Degree Movement, there was again by common consent an imme-
diate adjournment to the Theatre Royal, and the business was, as on the
previous occasion, transacted in this more appropriately and agreeably con-
structed building. A Provincial Company, who happened to be rehearsing at
the time, having been good-humouredly hustled off the Stage by the Proctors,
the Prompter placed a "property " Doge's Chair under the " T-light" for the use
of the 'Vice-Chancellor. On occupying it, however, he introduced such an
excellent and happily-conceived bit of business that a loud and spontaneous roar
of laughter and several shouts of "Encore!" greeted him as he finally sat
down. The proceedings then commenced.
— The Rev. Chairman, rising, said he need not recapitulate to such an assembly
the motives that had again drawn them together to further their one great
common object, namely, the incorporation of the Stage into the system of Univer-
sity Education—(loud cheers)—but he would content himself with reading to
them the following brief extract from an Article on the subject that appeared the
other day in an influential evening paper. "More,"
wrote the writer of that Article,_ can be learned of
Athenian life, and also of the comic method of AKISTO-
PHANES, by seeing one of his plays put on the Stage than
by reading all the eleven which are extant. Young
men will nnd a new interest in their Greek plays when
they have one or two realised before their eyes."
(Prolonged applause.) He was glad to hear such senti-
ments greeted in that fashion, because he was prepared
to go even further than the writer who expressed those
views. (" Hear! hear !" from the Jacksonian Professor
of Natural Philosophy.) He would say that young men
would not find a new interest in Greek alone, but in
everything else as well, when they had once had every-
thing realised for them before their eyes. (Applause.)
Need he say more? Everything taught in their Univer-
sity ought to be put upon the Stage. (Prolonged cheering.)
The Plumian Professor of Astronomy, wno had on a
large Pantomime demon's head, and whose appearance
in consequence created such an outburst of enthusiasm,
that he could be but with difficulty heard when he
attempted to address the meeting through a hole under
the chin, said, he trusted that his present little off-
hand effort—(criesof"No,no! it's splendid")—might be
taken as an earnest of what he intended to do in his own
particular line, when he got his chance. (Loud cheers.)
He had already ordered a black cotton-velvet astrologer's
gown, covered with the signs of the Zodiac in red tinsel,
and he had also given a commission for a crocodile
and property telescope, which he hoped and believed
would, in the matter of size, be two of the finest things
of their kind ever produced in Europe. (Cheers.)
Cambridge must march with the times. AVhen the youth
who attended his lectures had once had realised for them
before their eyes what an astronomer really was—on the
stage—they would pick up more from him and his comic
method, than by mere poring over all the books of
astronomy extant. He might add, that the great feature
of his reformed lectures, would be several quite gro-
tesque magic-lantern effects, and a character-song (with
a dance) entitled "Jam such a regular Para-la-llax"
specially written for him by a distinguished Doctor of
Music, who had his heart and soul in the movement.
(Great cheering.)
The Queen's Professor of Arabic here rose. He said
he had no wish to reflect on the learned Professor's pro-
gramme, but he trusted that the dance he referred to—
(" hear, hear.'")—which sounded to him, if he might
coin an expression, rather "Music-hally "—(laughter)
—would in no way interfere with his course of lectures
which would be given by himself, with five brother
Professors of Arabic, in spangled tights, on a carpet and
red velvet bolster. His idea was, in fact, an "Arabian
Drawing-room Entertainment"—(cheers)—with as much
lofty tumbling as they could manage, combined with a
few occasional short expressions in the vernacular, or
even in dumb show addressed to the audience. (" Excel-
lent !" from the Professor of Experimental Physics.) He
thought this would give a stimulus to the study of Arabic
—at least, it would enable the earnest student to under-
stand something of Arabian life. (Applause.)
The Professor of Sanskrit said he had been thinking
of the same sort of thing himself—(laughter)—but after
what had dropped from his learned colleague, he felt
he must fall back upon something else. He should very
probably endeavour to try and charm a snake or two—
(" hear! hear ! ")—and hoped in this he should have the
kindly co-operation of the Professor of Zoology. (A
Voice: "He knows nothing about it.'") Very likely
not. (Roars of laughter.) But they were all entering
on a new path, and he could learn. For his own part
he felt sure that his learned colleague, who had so often
skinned a snake for mere instruction, would not mind
for once being " scotched" himself in the higher interests
of amusement. (Cheers.)
The Woodwardian Professor of Geology said he meant
to illustrate an Earthquake. (Cheers.) He was already in
communication with the Manager of the Princess's
Theatre, London, and was engaging a Company for The
Last Days of Pompeii. He had also an "Antediluvian
Burlesque" in hand—not his own—(prolonged cheering)—
introducing all the principal monsters of the glacial
period. ("Oh, oh.'") It was a fact, and he hoped to play
a foreleg of something effective himself. (Cheers.)
The Public Orator here rose, and was about to read
The Charge of the Light Brigade, but was greeted with

such a prolonged storm of disapproval, that he had ultimately to
resume his seat. He was, however, understood to say that he would
be even with the best of them before he had done.
After a little discursive talk as to the future holding of all Public
Examinations in the Theatre, and the desirability of entirely sus-
pending the free-list on the occasion, the Master of Trinity said that
he thought that henceforth the Vice-Chancellor should be preceded
by a regular red-hot Pantomime Poker. (Much cheering.) He
thought these Stage accessories to Academic life could not be too
much insisted upon. And he was of opinion that their present busi-
ness-like discussion could not terminate more appropriately than in
a regular Stage banquet. (Thunders of applause, that lasted several
minutes.) He would be happy to provide that entertainment himself.
(Soars of laughter, in which the JKei\ Speakerjoined heartily himself.)
After the customary chorus and finale, and a little rough horse-
play, owing to the Professor of Mechanism and Applied Mechanics
endeavouring, in vain, to show the Auditor of the Chest the working
of a Vampire-trap, the Meeting was adjourned till next Tuesday.
Strange Omission.
THERE have been remarkable sunsets viewed in London. East-
bourne, Ramsgate, and many other places. But what is still more
remarkable is, that not one of the awe-struck Correspondents who
have written about these phenomena to the daily papers nas expressed
any astonishment at having seen any sunsets at all in England, as
every place where these strange appearances have been witnessed is,
of course, in the British Empire, on which, as we all know, "the
Sun never sets." So that is the first wonder to get over; the blazing
phenomena are of second-rate importance. Yet, though not super-
stitious, we firmly believe that something is going to happen.
"GBIP."—Odd name for a paper for Boys! Was it suggested by
Barnaby Rudge's Raven? Everyone recollects that he used to hop
about saying, "I 'm a Devil! I 'm a Devil!" It also croaked out,
"Never say die!" which is a good omen for a literary work, even
when coming from a Raven's beak.

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW NEPHELOCOCCUGIA;
OR, "BIRDS" OF A MODERN FEATHER.
A NOBLE Lord, of high Parliamentary repute, considerable literary
power, and no small gift of acrid Aristophanic humour, is, we under-
stand, about to superintend the production (at H-tf-ld H-se) of a
modernised adaptation of The Birds. We have the peculiar good
fortune to be able to present to our readers some particulars of the
proposed cast, together with a brief sketch of the drama and a few
characteristic extracts.
Nephelococcugia (or Cau-cus-cloud-crow-land) is. in'this case,
the K-d-e-1 Utopia or Limbo, intervenient. in these dire democratic
days, between the common herd of earth-dwellers and the high
Olympian Autocracy of the old oligarchical times, when everything
was imperious, imposing, and—especially—" impartial."
The following are some of the chief Dramatis Persona:—
EPOPS (Hoopoe-King of the Birds, formerly Played by
TOETUS, King of Bccotia, but metamor-
phosed in consequence of political
philanderings) J-HN B-LL.
PEISTHETAIBOS (a Citizen, disgusted trith his
original state, icho travels to seek his for-
tune in the Kingdom of the Birds. A.
man of business and ability, icho lores to
direct everyth ing and everybody. Voluble,
plausible, sophistic] GL-DST-NE.
EUELPIDES (another Citizen, companion of
PEISTHETAIEOS, a plain, shrewd person,
with an eye to the future) . . . CH-IIB-RL-N.
CHOBUS OF BIBDS (subjects of EPOPS, beguiled
by the blandishments of PEISTHETATROS
and the cunning of EuELPIDES. The
latter has furnished them with a common
crow-like cry, which may be represented
phonetically thus: "Cau-cau-cau-cus"). R-D-C-LS.
PROMETHEUS (a malcontent personage, up-
lifted, but timorous, disguised as an old
woman hiding under an umbrella) . . Q-BT-BLY R-VI-W.
IBIS (Messenger from Olympus, spry, and
grandiloquent) N-TI-X-L R-VI-F.NV.
POET (unimposing, but rhetorical personage,
who supplies IBIS with most of her tall-
talk) ALFB-D A-ST-N.
THE PBOPHETIC BIRDS (that of PEISTHETAI-
BOS an Owl, sage, serious, and earnest) . SP-CT-T-B.
(that of EOELPIDES, noisy fowl who
leads the clamorous " Cau-cau-cau-cus"
Chorus) SCH-DH-BST.
NEPTUNE (one of the Ambassadors from the
elder Gods, a formal, dignified, slightly
fussy person of the old school). . . N-BIHC-TE.
HEBCULES (ditto, ditto, a fiery, wrong-headed
personage, powerful, but indiscreet,
carrying a huge club bearing the mystic
word " Property ") S-L-SB-BY.
TBTBALLOS (ditto, ditto, an undisciplined,
mischievous outside," deity-perky, and
sparrow-like in appearance, causing
much vexation to the temperate NEPTUNE
by his gamin-like outbursts) . . . R-ND-LPH C'H-BCH-LL.
There are other characters of course, but these will give our
readers some idea of the course of the noble Dramatist's play, from
which space will not permit us to give more than a few extracts.
Some passages from the Parabasis will show that it ie not without
force and pertinence:—
Owl CorypJueus.
Ye Children of Man! whose life is a span,
(And that scarce worth spending, so M-LL-CK would say)
Plodding and wingless, morally kingless,
Fussy and Philistine creatures of clay.
Attend to the words of the R-d-c-1 Birds,
The only true Soarers, the heirs of air's glories,
"Who look from on high, with a pitying eye,
On the follies and frets of the Wh-gs and the T-ri-s.
Science bores us of late with eternal debate,
And_ wild Speculation about the Creation,
Organioal strife, protoplasmieal life,
And comical notions of oosmical motions;
Strange tales of descent from tailed creatures who went
Prehensilely swinging from branches, not winging;
Their unfettered flight through JEther and Light.
In the deep Tory Erebus foully bedight,
Many in darkened delusion still lag on,
In life dull as that of the Ape or the Dragon.
At length in Creation's great germinal closet
Was laid a most precious and privy deposit:
A Mystical Egg! 'Twas the radix or root
Of which we brave Birds are the ultimate fruit,
Who rove in the air, triumphantly furnished,
To range its dominions on glittering pinions,
All golden, and azure, and blooming, and burnished.
For Delphi, for Ammon, Dodona, in fine
For every oracular temple and shrine,
We Birds are a substitute equal and fair,
On us you depend, and to us must repair.
Then take us as Gods, and be ruled by our nods!
We '11 serve for all uses, as prophets and muses.
We '11 lengthen vour tether, we '11 all live together,
We '11 not hide in air,
Pompous and proud, a-top of a cloud,
(In old Jovian way) but attend every day
To prosper and bless all you possess,
Give you plenty of change, and unlimited range,
Reform quite ad lib., and a champion glib,
To whose eloquence voluble all things seem soluble.
Partake of this root, which King Hoopoe here brings,
Which forces the growth of true R-d-c-1 wings.
And then you '11 be Birds, blessed Birds of our band,
And free of the City of Cloud- Cau-cus-land!
Chorus.
Nothing can be more golumpshus than the having wings to wear.
Wingless, T-ry-thralTed poor mortals step up here and try a pair!
The new NEPHELOCOCCUGIA with its clamorous, cackling, cawing,
crowing, clucking, chirping, croaking, clapper-clawing denizens, is
desciibed with true Aristophanio verve—and verjuice. We wish we
had space for certain punpent passages a propos of the pompous
prolixity of Property-menacing PEISTHETAIBOS, and the cockney
Cockahoopoohiness of Cau-cus-chorus-leading EUELPIDES. We can,
however, only give extracts from the scenes describing the reception
of the Olympian Embassy,—
Neptune, The Triballian Envoy, Hercules.
Nep. There's NEPHELOCOCCUGIA! that's the town
Bird-built, whose airy battlements defy us.
[Turning to the TBIBALLIAN.
But you! WTiy, what a regular guy you are!
Look like a Bird yourself! Don't cock your nose,
And wag your tefl in that preposterous way!
They '11 take you for a sparrow.
Her. Or a Woodcock.
Tri. Drop it, old Cockalorums! Bah! Yah! Booh!
Leave me alone, or I '11 upset the pair o' you!
Nep. Why did they send him with us? Hercules,
I say,'what shall we do P What's your idea?
Her. Do f Take that PEISTHETAIBOS by the throat—
That throat whence flow exuberant sophistries
Which are the cause of all our tribulations—
And throttle him!
Nep. Hush! Our " tip" you know is peace.
Her. That makes no difference; or if it does,
It makes me long to throttle him the more!
Pei. (very busy, affecting not to see them). Give me the Brummagem
Spice. Where's the Leeds Sauce?
Municipal pickle, too. Come, mend our fires!
Her. Mortal, we greet and hail you! Three of us,
Three deities
Peis. (without looking up). But I'm engaged at present.
Busy, you see, seasoning our next big dish.
Her. (aside). To dish us, I suppose. (Aloud.) What's in the dish?
Birds seemingly.
Peis. (without looking up). Some very weak-shanked creatures,
Opposed to the popular democratic Birds,
Rendered themselves obnoxious.
Her. So yon dish them!
Just like disloyal democratic ways.
Peis, (looking up). Oh! bless me, Hercules, I 'm so glad to see you?
What is your business?
Her. (breaking out and flourishing his club wildly).
To jpull you down,
And bring your precious cloud-built noisy nest
Of clamorous birds at once about your ears,
You puffed up, prolix, property-menacing
DlSINTEGBATOE 1 ! I
Iris (hysterically). Go it! That'« the style!
Just like our old club-wielder!
Prometheus (flourishing his umbrella). Hear! Hear! Hear!
Fire, fire away, and I '11 take notes—and print 'em!

THE SPEAKER.
(,t Handbook to Ready-made Oratory.)
PAST VII.—BAH AND BENCH.
AT a first glance it would be imagined that " the Gentlemen of the
Long Robe scarcely require a guide to declamation. It is one of
the duties of an Advocate to defend, in eloquent terms, the interests
of his Clients. Certainly, rhetoric is not greatly appreciated in those
Courts in which Equity is said particularly to prevail over Law, but
at the Old Bailey, or in any other place where a common or special
jury congregates, a silvery tongue is of the last importance. But a
Barrister may be safely left to himself to speak when called upon in
Court. If he fails in his first attempt, there will be no necessity to
try to teach him to do better in the future, as the chances are enor-
mously against his ever having a second chance. Solicitors are
chary of repeating unsuccessful experiments. So it may be taken
that any attempt to assist a Barrister in becoming proficient in foren-
sic oratory would be absolutely futile. If a man after undergoing
the extremely severe examination now required by the Council of Legal
Education before he can be called to the Bar, cannot speak in Court,
he had better for ever hold his peace, as, in point of fact, no doubt
he will. But although this Handbook cannot teach a Counsel what
to say in the Royal Courts, it may, at any rate, contain a few short
speeches, warranted to prove admirable in their results if addressed
to a certain sort of Solicitor. Below, then, are given—
Half-a-dozen Speeches to be addressed by Counsel as occasion requires.
"My dear fellow, as you say, it is a most comfortable Club!
What! you would like to belong to it! I am on the Committee.
Pray let me put you up?"
"I say, my boy, what are you doing on Thursday? If not
better engaged, will you and Madame come and dine with us P"
"Look here, old man. My wife wants Mrs. TIMOTHY and her
charming daughters to share her carriage with her at the Eton and
Harrow Match. We might join them later."
"This is the best glass of Port I have ever tasted! What! still
twenty dozen left in your cellar! Well, all I can say is that I hope
you will give me plenty of opportunities on future occasions of
tasting it!"
"I confess, my dear friend, that I cannot see any reason why the
Profession should be divided into two branches. But until they are
amalgamated, I suppose, to the best of our ability, we must share the
work between us."
"By the way, old fellow, I think your people know that I have
changed my address at Lincoln's Inn. Eh?
It will be obvious to any stuff-gownsman that the above speeches,
if made judiciously—one of the four first always being used and pre-
ceding either of the two last—will not fail to do good. They must
of course be addressed to the proper people—to the "Hearts" not
the " Heads" of the Profession. That good, although lasting, will
be—brief.
Turning from the Bar to the Bench, the raison d'etre of this Hand-
book, so far as the forensic Profession is concerned, becomes more
discernible. Their Lordships seldom deliver orations in private life,
or, if they do, those orations are imperfectly reported in the news-
papers. The Judges are "understood to have thought" this or
"believed to have agreed upon" that; but at this point certainty
ends, and doubt commences. To say the least, such vague para-
graphs are far from satisfactory. To come to a modern instance.
Nothing could have been more shadowy than some of the sayings
ascribed to Lord COLERIDGE after his recent visit to America. Lnder
these circumstances, it will be as well to conclude this part by giving
two specimen speeches—one that might have been delivered by a
Judjje of the modern school, and one oy a Judge who respects old-
fashioned traditions. It must be remembered that however distaste-
ful some of the sentiments of their Lordships might appear to tile
Bar, all of the .judicial remarks would be received, according to
precedent, with the utmost deference.
Utterly superfluous Speech by a Judge of the Modern School .—
Gentlemen of the Bar! (All the Barristers in Court immediately
rise to their feet, and listen intently in an attitude of the most respect-
ful attention.) As I feel rather disinclined this morning to continue
the work of the Court in my customary hap-hazard manner, I pro-
pose suspending the business which has brought us here together,
while I make some remarks of a general character. I trust this will
suit the convenience of Counsel.
Leader of the Bar (bousing). On behalf of myself and my learned
friends, representing between us the interests of one hundred and
fifty-seven Clients, I beg to inform your Lordship that your Lord-
ship's suggestion meets with our entire approval.
Judge. I am glad to hear it. But before I say anything more, 1
must complain very bitterly of the New Law Courts in wnich you
are now standing. Although by virtue of my office I am a staunch
supporter of the Constitution, I still claim to be a Member of the
Great Republic of Taste. Some of the Bar may have heard this
declaration from the Bench before P
Leader of the Bar (bowing). I am informed by some of my learned
friends that your Lordship is quite correct in your supposition.
Judge. I thought so. Not only are these Courts hideous, but the
accommodation on the Bench ia so scanty that I have been unable to
find room for the bevy of Ladies who usually honoured us with their
presence on any occasion when the proceedings were of more than
ordinary interest. Having abused the Law Courts, I will now turn
my attention to what we may call procedure. I have been very
much struck with American Institutions. It will be remembered
that one of our Lordships (to quote from the formula in use on the
9th of November) has recently been touring through the. United
States, accompanied by a picked forensic company, and has been
received with considerable enthusiasm. Some of the Gentlemen of
the Bar may remember the circumstance?
Leader of the Bar (bowing). It is within the recollection of many
of mv learned friends that his Lordship was received with a
cordiality only equalled by that afforded to Jumbo the Elephant and
IBVINO the Comedian.
Judge. Exactly. Well, it is the intention of my brothers and
myself gradually to revolutionise the Bar. We propose to sweep
away all old forms. We consider that, although a Barrister has to
undergo a special training and to pass a special examination, there
is no reason why he should enjoy any particular privileges over the
members of the junior branch of the Profession.
Leader of the Bar (bowing). On behalf of myself and my learned
friends, acting on behalf of those who have instructed us, we beg to
thank your Lordship for this observation. However, we think it
right to say, on our own behalf, that we are merely carrying out our
instructions.
Judge. Just so. We propose following the lead of the Benchers of
the Inns of Court who, haying no sympathy with the members of the
Junior Bar, have done their utmost of late years to swamp the Pro-
fession with what I may call Converted Solicitors. It must be
remembered that when my brothers and myself were called to the
Bar, a Barrister was not required to know anything about law; and
to this day some of our number are still rather deficient in this
branch of forensic study, so that the fact of finding Solicitors pos-
sessing a smattering of the science, has filled us with feelings of
respect, not to say awe. So—to put it briefly—we have determined
to do our best to despoil the body from which we have sprung. By
revoking the privileges gained by Barristers at the cost of years of
study and hundreds of pounds, we hope before long to enable Solici-
tors to fill a far prouder position than that they now so ably occupy.
I trust this announcement will afford satisfaction to the Bar.
Leader of the Bar (bowing). Any observation of your Lordship
must of necessity be received with satisfaction by my learned friends
and myself—even the scheme your Lordship has just been food

immediate ruin!

resume the business of the Court.

So much for Specimen No. 1. Now for Specimen No. 2.:—
Utterly superfluous Speech of a Judge who respects old-fashioned
Traditions.—A Judge who respects oltt-fashioned traditions, never
makes an utterly superfluous speech!
Cupid to Order.
N a suit for the Restitution of Conjugal Rights (when is this
absurd portion of the Law to be abolished P), the President orders
"an attachment." This is Love to order with a vengeance. If the
order is not complied with, then the President goes a step further,
and "orders an attachment to issue." But what if there be no
issue? The Law utterly fails. There's a cynicism about the asso-
ciation of wreckage with marriage in the Divorce and Admiralty
Divisions being under the same President.
IN England there are Masonic Dinners, and Charitable Society
Dinners of all sorU: "Nothing can be done without a dinner,"—
which is exactly what the starving poor say.

Her Majesty. It gives me the greatest satisfaction. Sir CHAELES,
to repeat to you in person my very hearty thanks for the many visits
you nave paid to the dwellings of the Poor in London.
Sir Charles [bowing], I can assure you, Madam, that had not
vour Majesty made the suggestion, my own sense of duty would
have caused me to undertake the task.
Her Majesty (smiling). You know it is a tradition in our family
to do our best for the sick and destitute. My children are never so
happy as when they are assisting to establish Homes or Hospitals.
And now, before you conclude a visit which I trust has been a verv
pleasant one to both of us—(Sir CHAELES bows low]—let me see if I
clearly understand what you have said. It is your opinion that
legislation directed to ameliorate the condition of the Poor—(Sir
CHABLES bows, and murmurs beneath his breath, "The Pro-
letariat"')—is the safest mode of protecting our present Consti-
tution; that, in fact, kindness—charity and real interest—shown to
beggars and those who are forced to live with criminals—if not,
indeed, to criminals themselves—is the best, if not the only, method
of nipping Communism in the bud. Is not this the sense of what
you have said to me'(
Sir Charles (in a deprecating tone}. Certainly, Madam; although
I scarcely ventured to use the very plain expressions your Majesty
has graciously adopted.
Her Majesty (with a smile). I thought, Sir CHAKLES, you were
fond of plain-speaking. 1 have a very good memory, and fancy that
no one could ever accuse you of not having tho courage of your
opinions. (Handing Sir CHARLKS a copy of a popular periodical.) You
will see that you have not been forgotten this week by Mr. Punch.
Let me tell you, Sir CHABLES, that there are not very many of my
subjects who can boast of having figured as the hero of an entirely
complimentary Cartoon. But I think, as usual, Mr. Punch has
shown wise discrimination—you deserve the distinction. I suppose
you are very conversant with his pages?
Sir Charles. I know every line Mr. Punch has written by heart,
Madam. I see that your Majesty has been studying Volume Sixty-
two. (Looking through the leaves of a book lying on the table.) Dear
me, how time flies; this was actually published eleven years ago!
\_Suddenly starting and regarding Cartoon far March 30th, 1872,
intently.
Her Majesty (smiling). I can guess the picture that has attracted
your attention. It was produced just after a silly thoughtless boy
had pointed an empty pistol at my carriage, and Mr. Punch, with his
customary ingenuity, had turned the incident to account. There was
a certain young enthusiast in those days who, full of good intentions,
had not quite attained to years of discretion. This young enthusiast,
in his zeal for reform, and hatred of shams, attacked good and bad
together, without showing much discrimination. Mr. Punch
pictured this young enthusiast aiming a blow at the Throne itself,
and excusing his conduct on the score " that there was nothing in
it!" Ah! that picture appeared eleven years ago, and I feel certain
that that young enthusiast must have taken the lesson to heart.
Yes. I am told by his colleagues, that he is one of the hardest
working Ministers of the Crown—able.straightforward, loyal—as much
a friend to his Sovereign as to her People! (Smiling.) Are you still
looking at that Cartoon, which seems so strange to us nowadays?
Sir Charles (bowing to the ground, with the Volume in his hand).
No, Madam, when I came to that Cartoon, I thought it time to turn
over a new leaf! [Scene closes in upon a very pleasant picture.

THE FAIRYLAND REVIEW.
Is " dating" fit for fairy hands? By any chance could you
Imagine Fairies writing for the Twaddlesome Review?
Or penning heavy columns in a carping, captious key,
And being rude and quarrelsome 'neath shelter of the " We."
Of course not, so in merry rhyme some Christmas books we '11 " do,"
In a light and airy fashion, for the Fairyland Review.
But first let 'a speak well by the card, or rather by the Cards,
For here they are in thousands, with " Best wishes, "Kind regards."
Enough to build a House of Cards just now have come to hand,
Or build a Paper Palace in delicious Fairyland!
Here'» RAPHAEL TUCK with packs on packs, a vast and brave array,
With etchings, colour symphonies—an elegant display!
E'en though you sneer at Christmas Cards, you 41 feel inclined to
gush
O'er wondrous screens and novelties in satin, silk, and plush!
And MABCUS WABD, who revels in variety untold,
Has bees and books and butterflies, all glorious with gold,
With rare artistic wonders, too, so beautiful and brignt,
In pictures, poems, and welcomes most daintily bedight.
But HLLDESHEIMEB-FACLKNEB, as everybody knows,
Have scores of lovely studies of the lily and the rose:
With dicky-birds and pussy-cats, with rare conceit or rhyme,
Enshrining pleasant greeting for the merry Christmas time!
The figures, flowers and calendars undoubtedly are good,
With tiny fans of novel form, from EYBE AND SPOTTISWOODE;
And PRANG & Co. and ACKEBMANN send marvels of design,
And SCHIPPEB'S tiger-lilies are indubitably fine!
JOHN WALKER sends hand-painted cards, on ivory they 're limned,
On dainty satin cushions all most radiantly trimmed;
While SPABAGNAPANE—suggestive name for this most skilful man—
He'll " spare nae pain" to Cosaques make as lovely as he can.
O'er TOM SMITH'S Christmas Crackers you '11 gleefully rejoice,
They 're wonderfully various and exquisitely choice.
Here are countless books for babies, you scarce know which to take—
Mrs. BAHKER will enchant you with ner Little Wideawake:
"Pis full of coloured pictures, which make each story clear,
By CHABLOTTE WEEKS, and others, with KATE GREENAWAY, and
WEIR.
The book about King Arthur you will be delighted with,
The drawings are by FBASEB and the history by FRITH;
To very great advantage in Ascents does he appear,
In telling of the perils of the hardy mountaineer.
The verses on bold Robin Hood, that outlaw of renown,
Are edited by RITSON and the drawings are by BROWNE.
And Every OirVs and Every Boy's are Annuals to buy—
A fact which all the boys and girls immediately descry!
St. Nicholas in volumes is a fund of pure delight
For children of all altitudes at morning, noon, and night.
Only a Child, a story is by M. A. ELLIS writ,
With pictures to propitiate each frolicsome young chit.
Blind Man's Holiday 's a welcome work, by one who seldom fails,
With ABSOLON to illustrate a string of merry tales.
Afternoon Tea has wondrous charm, its pictures are so quaint,
"fis just the book, the very book, for baby-hands to paint;
And SOWEBBY and EMMEBSON you easily may see,
Are ever hailed by little ones with joyf ulness and glee!
While youngsters who would like to know of boats and blocks and
sails
Should give their minds to studying Ships, Birds, and Wonder Tales.
The Fairies writ by ALLINGHAM, most joyfully you '11 read—
Miss GEBTBTTDE THOMSON'S pictures they are excellent indeed!
The Fairy Horn, by THETHE SMITH, pray don't forget to view,
Or overlook another SMITH who writes The Babe's Debut:
And every word you '11 master—with no desire to skim—
In very clever Clever Hans, by dear old Brothers GRIMM.
A skilful author deftly spins a pleasant children's yarn
Which HENNESSEY well illustrates—they call it Hannah Tame.
Ah! Nights with Uncle Remus will scare away all gloom;
For such an uncle, TOMMIES will all cheerfully make room!
The tale of dear old Robinson—our Crusoe brave and hold-
In words of single syllables is curiously told;
By clever Miss GODOLPHIN, and most artfully does she
Adapt for baby paraphrase the old Swiss Familee.
But here is Old Wives' Fables vml by EDOTJARD LABOULAYE;

Sheer Pluck, With CUve in India, are books boys can't put down,
The author is GEORGE HENTY, and the artist GOBDON BBOWNE;
Who, in The Golden Magnet—by the skilful MANVILLE FEJTN—
With clever graphic pencil gives a piquancy to pen:
In Wigwam ana the War-path, too. nis talent has full scope,
To illustrate the stories that are told by ASCOTT HOPE.
Picked up at Sea, by HuiCHESON, you '11 gladly read, no doubt,
And a score or two of others we can't now write about.
And here the Fairies pause for play, they fain would dance, and so
You '11 wait for information from TITANTA & Co.
IN THE TIME OF THE EESTAUKATION.
WE have, a long time ago, of course, "Dreamt that we dwelt in
marble halls, with vassals and serfs by our side," but we only realised
it the other night at the Holborn Restaurant, when, the vassals and
serfs being represented by the civil and attentive waiters, "of all who
assembled within those walls, we were their hope and their pride "—
that is, up to a certain well-earned bonus, which, except when " No
Fees" is the rule on penalty of dismissal, is always due to ROBERT
the Waiter.
It is also a long time since we have been in this part of the Holborn
Restaurant Restaurated. There is nothing like it anywhere, as far
as our recollection serves, in London or in Paris.
Seeing the Holborn full, but not overcrowded, and vacant
places immediately filled up by relays of Diners,—we may para-
phrase the words of Mr. E. L. BLANCHABD'S immortal contribution
toJNigger Minstrelsy, and sing,
"We 've been to the East, we 've been to the Vest,
We 've been to South Carolina,"
Which isn't a fact, but it saves trouble to retain this line as it stands
in the original,—
"But of all the things we 'd like to be best,
It is the Holborn Diner."
And to Mr. J. MOLLOV'S sweet air of " Dinah Doe" might be set
"0 Diner, Diner, Diner, Diner at the Hoi-
bom syn" he for a guinea
May dine/owr, nor spend a pinny
More than that if your way you know."
Only you mustn't sing this while the band is performing, nor, indeed,
when it isn't, unless you keep it to yourself, in which case, you may
give yourself as many airs as you like without interfering with any-
body. The salon where we were entertained is one of the public
dining-rooms, and it at once occurred to a musician of our party,
"What a Hall of Music it would make"; while the ladies imme-
diately discovered that it would be magnificent as a Ball-room.
Wouldn't it be splendid! A fancy ball here! Well it would,
but .... "Yes, with supper in the Venetian saloon." Ah! that's
another matter. But we are satisfied with it as a Restaurant.
Just think what the old chop-house used to be! Ladies couldn't
go there, and if you wanted to give them a dining-out treat,—just
something out of the usual run,—and quite equivalent (so it might
be artfully put) to a visit to Paris without the "crossing "—though
this might De included by walking—you had to take them to an
expensive hotel, dine in a private room, and were compelled to make
a party of it in order to be at all lively. But here, DABBY and JOAN
can go in, take their little table all to themselves, a table gar-
nished with fruit and flowers, while the band, bidden to discourse,
does so in the second gallery, and you can play a good knife and
fork (spoon too if you like, sotto uoce, of course) to its accompaniment.
Then if you are not going to risk indigestion and draughts by going:
to a theatre, you can at 8'30 call for the fragrant Mooha, the quali-
fying chasse, and strike the light lucifer previous to applying it to
your cigar. Then you can lean back in your chair, and regard
your convives with that feeling of entire satisfaction which comes
over a good man when he has well dined, and you will say that this
is the oest possible Restaurant in the best of all possible worlds.
Then, being in a " merry mood," you will call for the attentive
Manager, Mr. HAMT. and with an aspirate, emphasis gratid, tell
him you have done Hample justice to the menu and to the Pom-
mery, which is here, I believe, a specialite. A Frenchman, say the
observant MAX O'RELL, would conclude, from seeing the number of
people dining at the Holborn, that the English are not a domestic
people; that they are always frequenting Restaurants and seldom
dining at home.
If all Restaurants were like this one, with six courses and dessert
for three-and-sixpence, and all good—though of course; the days
must, vary—JOAN, the thrifty housewife, would find dining here
actually cheaper than dining at home: but this might interfere with
Mr. DABBY'S Club arrangements. The Holborn Restaurant dinner
wfll be to many jog-trotters, who may be just a bit tired of domestic
monotony, an acceptable novelty, in respect to which we are glad
to make this Inn-ovation.

distance, please Coppee.
"PRESUMING!"
IT is presumed by the English Law " that a man is innocent until
he has been proved to be guUty." Quite so; and now let us see how
it works.
He it Accused.—There is only a single Witness against him. He
can declare his respectability, and point to the records of a hitherto
blameless life. Quite superfluous, as already observed, "it is pre-
sumed by English Law that a man is innocent until he has been
proved to be guilty." In spite of this, he is taken into custody,
and marched off to the Station House.
He is Brought up before a Magistrate.—As he is presumably inno-
cent, he is placed in the criminal's dock. He is told that, as his
guilt is not to be thought possible until proved as plain as the sun at
mid-day, "he had better not say anything, aa it will be taken down
and used against him." Finally, he is remanded for a week.
Bail is Refused.—As the greatest care must be taken that a blame-
less man shall not suffer, he who is presumably guiltless is quietly
lodged in prison, where he undergoes a punishment apparently
intended only for the wicked. However, while sweeping out his cell,
and looking through the bars of the gaol, he can console himself with
the thought that it is presumed by the English Law " that a man is
innocent until he has been proved to be guilty!"
He is Re-examined. He again appears in the dock. He is again
warned to be careful. He is guarded by the Police, and snubbed by
the Magistrate. All this because "it is presumed by the English
Law," &o., &c. Finally, he is committed for trial, and once more is
carried back in a prison-van to the gaol—consoling himself with the
thought that " until he has been proved guilty," &c., &o.
He Awaits his Trial in Gaol.—Although it is contrary to the
liberty of the subject to incarcerate an innocent man, he undergoes
as much imprisonment as a convicted thief or a condemned assassin.
Moreover, he has the services of the Chaplain, whose ministrations
being peculiarly efficacious with convicts, are consequently extremely
comforting to a presumably innocent man. If the Warder and the
Governor regard him with distrust, he yet f eels that they must know
that " in the eye of the English Law a man," &c., &c.
He Takes his Trial.—He, as the most interested person in the
Court, has least to do with the proceedings. His own account is
inadmissible. He cannot "speak through'1 his Counsel, for that
person at most can merely hint at his innocence. He thus learns
practically that although "the English Law presumes that a man is
innocent until he has been proved to be guilty," British Justice
will never allow the accused to personally testify to the fact.
The Verdict of the Jury.—After months of acute anxiety, passed
by the accused behind prison-bars, twelve "good men and true" at
length are collected together to declare that he is "Not Guilty."
Justice is gratified. Under the circumstances, then, it was quite
right " to presume that until a man has been proved to be," &c.. &c.
The Verdict of Society.—People remember that the liberated one
has been several times before a Magistrate, often in a gaol, and once
in the dock at the Old Bailey. So, although quite agreeing that in
the eyes of our English Law a man is deemed—and should be deemed—
to be guiltless until his sin is brought home to him, that—<>f course
theoretically—he has left the Court without a stain upon his charac-
ter—that, in fact, the charge made against him was false, and the
prosecution he had to undergo was superfluous, yet—yet—yet can't
help presuming that " there must have oeen something m it!"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I
UNJUST RATES!
Ms. PUNCH'S indignant protest against
the iniquities of unjust Rates has produced
an amount of interest and gratitude among
the poor victims of the abominable system,
that nas pleased but not surprised him.
Another poor puzzled Ratepayer, with a
•wife and small family, who opens his shop
at 8 A.M. and closes it at 10 P.M., and finds
himself, with all his care and self-denial,
gradually getting poorer and poorer, while
his Rates are becoming higher and higher,
sends us a statement showing that for the
same house he now inhabits, whereas he
used some years ago to pay £16 a year for
Rates, he now j>ays £30. to enable him to do
which he and his poor little family have to
make such sacrifices as reduce his living to
the mere necessaries of life. A few years
ago the street in which he lives was widened.
It was not of the slightest benefit to his
trade, hut rather the contrary, as people
hesitate to cross a wide street, but his
Landlord immediately raised his Rent £30 a
year, and his Rates were, of course, raised
in proportion; in addition to which he had
to pay an increased Rate for the cost of
improving his Landlord's property.
Another victim, who carried on business
in one of the principal City thoroughfares,
was paying the enormous rental of £800 a-
year, his gross profits being £1,500. The
street was improved, as it is called,'and
his rent increased to £1000. So that out
of the £1,500, the annual profits of his life
of toil and anxiety, his grasping Landlord,
who literally does nothing but watch for an
opportunity of getting a little more, takes
two-thirds for his share, and the poor strug-
gling Tradesman has the remaining one-third
left for his share, out of which he has to pay
an enormous sum for Rates, which sum was
increased by nearly £40 a-year by the im-
provement which had already cost him £200
a-year, which his Landlord had received
without the expenditure of a single shilling!
If these be but examples of what is going
on around us, who can sufficiently admire
the astonishing amount of patience with
which this crying iniquity is borne P
TVith a view of probing this important
matter still further, Mr. Punch has re-
quested one of the youthful members of that
portion of his staff who dedicate their lives
to his statistical department, to analyse
and digest the whole of the statistics that
were forwarded in waggon-loads to the
Home Office last spring by the various
local Authorities of the Metropolis for the
information of Sir WILLIAM HABCOTTRT.
This has accordingly been done, with
results that, Mr. Punch confesses with a
blush, have even staggered his well-con-
ditioned mind. They are, of course, far too
voluminous for the short space that he can
spare from the other multitudinous calls
upon him, but they will possibly be shortly
published in six volumes folio, as light read-
ing for the Christmas holidays.
But just to prove what an El Dorado to
wealthy men is the City of London, to which
favoured spot Mr. Punch will for the present
confine himself, what a perfect Paradise to
grasping Landlords, what a haven of bliss
to those who toil not, and who spin not, and
who pity not, he will call attention to this
one astounding fact, that, whereas, only
some fifteen years ago, the annual rent paid
for the houses occupying the one square
mile of the City of London amounted to
about one million eight hundred thousand
pounds, the annual rent now paid for the
houses occupying the same one square mile,
has increased to the enormous sum of four

"OUR BOYS."

ARTICLE I"
millions! It is perhaps almost needless to say that this astounding statement was at first
received with, to use the very mildest phrase Mr. Punch's ample vocabulary suggests to him, a
scornful smile of incredulity, but on the quietly repeated assurance by his gifted statistician
that it was as " right as mnepence," he at once yielded the point, and hereby presents it to
an astonished world as perhaps the most remarkable revelation of modern times.
The annual rent paid for the buildings on a single square mile of land is four millions
sterling! Cqnseauently, at twenty-five years' purchase the fee simple, as the simple Lawyers
call it, of this single square mile of land would amount to just one hundred millions sterling!
"How THE POOH LIVE."—The 16th of this month will be just forty years since TOM
HOOD'S immortal "Song of the Shirt" appeared in Mr. Punch's pages. The " Bitter Cry"
is as loud and as heartrending now as then. Mr. Punch is generally first in the field for the
public benefit, and, when necessary, he is first in the slums, as he was this year with his
"Real Haunted House," which appeared in page 50 of the number dated August 4th.

THE MEN.
"THE Men." All-comprehensive term, most wide
Of generalisations, in the tide

Of female prattle ever bobbing up,
Like mimic icebergs in a claret cup,
Or "I's" in EOOMET'S smart social " pars."
The Men! A galaxy of twin-orbed stars
Gleams round great PUNCHTUS as he nibs his pen
To sparkle to the Sparklers on " the Men."
The subject, to the softer sex's view,
Is zenith, nadir, and horizon too.
These be the Greeks, to be or crushed or charmed,
'Gainst whom our Amazons would fain be armed.
Odd fish, the modern males, of greed not great
For Matrimony's old and simple bait:
A sigh and a soft hand, a dimply smile,
A sleeve-worn heart, a naively obvious wile,
A lip-curve tremulous, or a tearful look,
Will scarce avail to lure them near the hook.
So Lalages and Bonnibels might win,
But souls susceptible to chic and "tin"
Not so are taken. "When soft OVID sang
^Esthetic argot and athletic slang
"Were strange to female lips. Men had not heard
That Atalanta " romped in like a bird ;"

To " put the pot on" or to "spot a winnah."
Nor yet had any green and girlish reader

Well, tempora mutantur. Now, as then,
The female problem's how to "fetch" the men.
The fisherman who, armed with net or rod,
Laid the same bait for gudgeon as for cod,
Might miss his ttnny spoil. What would you catch.

By worshipping their wisdom—in sweet show.
(The genuine cult might be too hard, you know)—
Not as NELL does it; NELL 's so prompt to gush,
The readiest vanity, constrained to blush
By overt adulation, may fight shy;
But oh, the adoring lift of a soft eye
Suffused with silent homage! So.be sure,
Looked simple Desdemona on the Moor;
And every clever or heroic fellow
Is, doubt not. more or less of an Othello
In this regard. Say he's a soldier-star,
Lack from big conduct in a little war;
He takes you down to dinner. As you hook
Your arm in his that rapt adoring look
Comes to your finer orbs which one may mark
In MARY ANJTEB sauntering in the Park
With her six foot of scarlet. Or suppose
The brightest lifrht that ever sudden rose
On Science's horizon asks your hand
For the first dance. , With smile most safely bland
He '11 sidewise bend his massive brow which store
Of Tyndall " twisters " and Darwinian lore
Freights to top-heaviness, to catch the shy
Low query from your lips. How lights his eye
With smile complacent when your Ups let fall
In polysyllables their little all
Of 7Vme»-learnt terminology. You lift
Arch eyes. "Those hunters of the river-drift,—
Pray have vou seen their bones ?"—a shudder small—
"And do they really topsy-turvy all
Chronology completely, and upset
Mosaic myth? Sounds wicked; yes,—and yet
I should so like to know. They cramp us girls "—
A sigh—"in crude conventions." Science twirls
A dubious moustache. He "fears to bore,"
"But if you really care." "Oh! you adore
All—all that sort of thing. Bathybius, now
What does it mean, exactly?"
Solemn brow
Of Science, tangled mop of modish Art
Cover alike conceit. 'Tis girldom's part
To move that master-passion in its lair
'Neath the bald pate or the full flowing hair.
Ask Eros else. The urchin-god will smile,
And sing a bantering ballad, in this style:
His version of the text seers are so sweet on,
The old Ufataiotes Mataioteton!
CUPID'S CABOL.
We, I and Venus, sway all things between us,
Rule both the hearts and the heads of humanity.
Some, though, have neither. How hold them in tether?
With thine invisible bridle, oh Vanity!
Hearts? Though no few men, and some among women,
Bear valves or leather in bosoms of granite, I
Know how to tickle the cold, hard, or fickle;
All will respond to thy feather-touch, Vanity!
Heads? There is many a vacuous zany
Lacks enough brain e'en to suffer insanity;
Yet me will follow. A cranium hollow
Forms fitting home for thy vapours, 0 Vanity!
Ask you the motive of offerings votive.
From Coldness to me, Cynic s gush, Pride's urbanity?
Why Churl and Stupid alike cringe to Cupid,
Fawn upon Venns? 'Tis Vanity, Vanity!
Pity's akin to love, the proverb says:
Less closely than the well-gorged greed of praise.
Known by that name? Nay. Sirens, not at all,
"Yearning for sympathy " the wise it call,
And you are wise. The cynic club-trained vouth,
Who mocks at sentiment and yawns at truth,
Is a shy fish, and little apt to rise
To tremulous lips or soft appealing eyes.
You will not witch him with a pretty pose,
Twitterings by moonlight, twaddlings o'er a rose;
No Romeo he, his coldly critic sneer
Appraises passion like an auctioneer.
Ana yet beneath that morgue—preserved perchance
Like fish in ice,—for all his sceptic glance,
And keen self-conscious wariness of mien,
Vanity lives and thrives, as quick and green
As in the soldier's or the savant's soul;
He's bound, by devious ways, to the same goal.
Nay, tell it not in Clubdom's Gath, his heart—
If he '11 permit one so to name that part—
Hangs obvious on his sleeve in such plain sort
As makes it quarry clear for Cupid's sport.
Vain of his knowingness, the verdant sage,
Read by keen SYLVIA like an open page
Is caught by chic and coolness, and the veiled
Suggestion of the fire that never failed
To soften save when flaunted. "SYLVIA? Oh!
A jolly girl; no nonsense, don't you know,
And understands a fellow,"—synonym
For the warm gusher's " sympathy," with him;
And this deep fount of " svmpathy" once tapped,
The wariest bird is safely lured and trapped.

CANTO IV.—THE MEN (CONTINUED).
TBAPPED? And is Love a net? la all its art
To play the vigilant bird-snarer's part,

And vagrant fancies, like shy finches, catch?
Humph! Would you win a mate or " make a match "?
So queries WINIFRED of the watchet eyes:
So counter-queries PUJTCHIUS the Wise.
Gusher and Cynic are alike but geese;
One cackles, t'other hisses. Babblers, cease
Apportioning your praise to this or that!
Although the one is sharp, the other flat,
They both are simply out of tune with truth;
The wise man will be neither, knowing both.
But means to ends must be adapted still;
Many will practise with elaborate skill
The Art of Love, who ne'er may know its nature,
Since Passion's lore and Cupid's nomenclature
Are learned alike by Cynic and bv Clown,
TIMON or CYMON. "TiMON takes the Town
With icy insolence of drawling speech,
Slow as the circulation of a leech,
Yet of so callous confidence that it
Passes with dullards less self-poised for Wit.
Would Psyche win him with a passion pure?
Rather he 'd rise to arch TIMANTHA'S lure,
TntANiHA false as Crcssid and as cold
As Becky Sharp, but so serenely bold,
So valiantly responsive, eye and hand,
So swift to see, so prompt to understand,
The veiled or half-avowed, that "a smart run"
With her is more than rapture,—'tis "good fun,"
Society's best beatitude, all unknown
To the soft bosom or the straitened zone.
And CYMON? CYMON is a Curate mild,
Or cricket-loving muscular big child.
Bull-throated, sheepish-smiling, he can smite
The spheric leather almost out of sight,
Flex the ash scull to semblance of a bow,
Or hurl the hammer seventy feet or so.
Him would you witch with babblings about books,
Parade of crewel-work or crochet-hooks?
No, with the chances Henley Reach or Lord's
To Mayfair Galatea free affords,
When she would tickle Titans. She, of late,
Athletic honours, in a Cookham eight,
Contests with mere male muscle, adding grace
That wins the eye to strength that wins the race.
Ah! me, the snowy flannel cinctured close
With azure, fair flushed cheeks that shame the rose,
The close-mopp'd curls crowned with the jaunty straw;
The comic clench of the soft-rounded jaw,
Stern set in strenuous effort, the alert
Tense muscle, prompt for steady spin or spurt!
Whom, what might they not win f CYMON at least
His blue unspeculative eyes will feast
On such a picture, feel his fancy warm
At this divine development of "form."
CrMON whom Punch hath seen on Thames's tide,
In all a Benedick's unbounded pride,
Of fresh possession " stroking" smartly down
Past Ciiefden's golden woods, bare-armed and brown,
With glance triumphant o'er his shoulder cast,
Arid laughing query, "Do I pull too fast?"
Sure of a confident negative from lips
Through which sweet breath in equal pulses slips
Unfluttered and unstrained. Clear, bright, and strong
Her laugh bewitched him, whom the Sirens' song
Had left untouched. Where laughter wins its way
Why waste the sweetness of LIGEA'S lay?
Yet where you 'd softly snare, shock not nor frighten
A more sophisticated modern Titan,
Self-conscious, self-admiring, proud to pose
The Providence of pic-nics, one who rows,
Pot-hunting prowess in his every stroke;
Him too close emulation may provoke,
Not prepossess. Him follow and not lead!
The hands that fumble, and the lips that plead
Will with the subtlest throes of flattery thrill
His soul, and mould young Anak to your will.
Hear Cupid's confidences once again!
Did Love's selected Laureate choose, the strain
That uttered his revealings might display
The touch Asmodean. Nay, turn not away
Fawn-eyed LUCILE or fiery-orbed FAUSTINE!
He sings virginibus ptiensque. Spleen
Sardonic might an Ars Amandi shape
That garlands should not deck, nor fancy drapo
In garb Arcadian only. Cupid knows
More than in genial stanzas fitly flows
When girlhood is the audience. He could tell
How Mammon and worse spirits counter-spell
His purer inspirations; how the heart
Is made a Moloch altar, or a mart
For sordid merchandise. Not for to-day
The sterner strain, this song shall not betray
FATTSTINE or fright LUCILE. He holds the myrtle,
And not the nettle; sharp his dartlets hurtle;
But if some sting, the sly satiric touch
The softest bosom shall not scathe o'ermuch.
CUPID.
AMANDTTS, pride of the swift-flowing river,
Callous as Pan held his triumphant way on,
Untouched by any dartlet from my quiver,
Holding girl-hearts, like gathered reeds, to play on
Pleasant impromptu pipings, fleeting lays,
Brief paeans of self-praise.
A comely churl, a shallow-soul'd Adonis,
A river-haunting, self-possessed Narcissus,
Cackling in slang of " form," and " pots," and "jponies,"
Deeming girlsTjorn to comfort, flatter, kiss us,
And fond of varying shandy-gaff, pipes, spurting,
With non-committal flirting.
AMANDA—ah, AMANDA! Such bright twists
Of tangled chestnut glittering as she shook 'em!
And who would think that pair of dimpled wrists
Could stroke untired from Maidenhead to Cookham,
That swelling breast bear with so little trouble
Passion or pulling double?
A cool coquette, with glance as warm and sunny
As Marlow Reach in August midday. Knowing
AMANDUS quite aufond, soul, muscle, money:
He deemed that he was coaching her—in rowing,
But, unaware and all unwilling, taught her
The' art of cynic-slaughter.
An easy art! Eh? None of mine 9 Why, verily,
I had not much to do with this cool couple.
Yet I, dans cette galore, oft chuckled merrily
To watch wit make cold metal hot and supple.
Alternate blast and douche dart points will temper,
Or hearts—eadem semper!
Hers was no Pan-pipe for the passing playing
Of any cynic-satyr draped in flannel,
But, siren-strained, the churl to bonds betraying.
Though Phoabus might have deemed it poor and scrannel.
It does not need the flutings of a god
To witch a comely clod.
So every sort of man, the sage, the sad,
The thrall of muscle or of maudlin fad,
Hath his unarmoured place. Think not to trap
In Girton meshes, like a soft she sup,
The hero of the cinder-path; nor hope
With Pater-patter or libullian trope
To snare the unconscious slave of lesser slang,
Whose ears upon Burlesque's stale twaddlings hang,
And hold Anaoreon's raptures rot and trash,
Compared with variants of the verb "to Mash."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUTTING IT PLEASANTLY.
Sir Pompty't Architect (producing a Plan], "TasRt, SIR FOMPEY! I FLATTER
MYSELF I HAVE MADE THAT DRAWING PLAIN TO EVEN TUE HBAt/BST CAPACITY!"
THE SPEAKER.
(A Handbook to Ready-made Oratory.)
PAST VIII.—How TO PROPOSE THE HEALTH OF AN IMPOST ANT PUBLIC OFFICIAL.
"TIMES change, and we with them," and its Latin equivalent are particularly
stale platitudes. Staleness, however, does not detract from their truth. All
things alter, and are altered—even lists of toasts. Twenty or thirty years ago,
Literature, Science, and the Drama were scarcely recognised. Nowadays an
Actor is invariably received with the utmost cordiality when he rises to return
thanks for the " great heartiness" which has accompanied the drinking of his
health. But we are not likely to stop here. Of late there has been displayed,
in the most influential quarters, a great disposition to "take up" another
character, whose Stage, fitted with a trap-door used more frequently in the
morning than in the evening, is yet thoroughly associated with the most sensa-
tional performances. No doubt his turn will soon arrive for this special form
of distinction. So, under these circumstances, it may be as well to prepare the
Public for the occurrence.
To carry out the intention of making this Handbook as complete as possible,
the report of the first occasion on which the toast will be proposed is MW pro-
pheticaUy given. As the subject is decidedly dramatic, it is dealt with in a
dramatic form:—
SCENE—A Banqueting-Hall filled with miscellaneous Guests. The Chairman
has proposed " the loyal toasts" and i» about to suggest one of another cha-
racter, when a simpering middle-aged Spinster claims permission to address
a few words to the assembled throng. Her request is granted, and she rises
jauntily, announcing herself as—
Miss Trizy Gruesome. You must really forgive me for claiming your atten-
tion for a little while—I promise that it shall be only for a little while. (" Hear,
hear.'") I am rather surprised at the interruption. Remember that I am a
Lady; and, as a Lady, I claim all the privileges of my sex. (Loud cheering.)
Having disposed of a very unseemly outrage—(cheers)—I think we can get on
comfortably together. Like other Ladies, I am ex-
tremely nervous and timid. What else can you expect
of a female who possesses neither the strength nor the
boldness of a man? (Cheers.) I, and those like me,
would be shocked at a prize-fight — it would be so
brutal. (" Hear, hear !") And u we were asked to be
present at a Spanish " distraction," in which a bull had
to be killed, and blinded horses to be gored to death, we
should simply faint. (Cheers.) Oh, yes, I pride myself
upon the attributes of my sex—mercy, kindness, refine-
ment. (Loud applause.) But poor woman must have her
pleasures, and one of the most agreeable to her is that
which is associated with a Court of Justice. (" Hear,
hear ! ") I consider a good trial the most charming thing
in the world—I do, indeed. When a good trial takes
Slaoe at the Central Criminal Court, nothing is more
elightf ul than to secure a nice comfortable seat on the
Bench, where you can hear and see everybody. I am sure
the Judges and the Aldermen are the most charming of
people; and are never so pleased as when I, or one like
me, is perched up beside them.
A Judge (interrupting). Pardon me, Madam; but it is
my opinion, and the opinion of many of my colleagues,
that a woman listening to the painful details of a heart-
rending case of felony, is a scandal to the civilisation of
the nineteenth century.
Miss Trixy Gruesome (giggling}. Oh, you are too hard
upon us! (Laughter.) I only wish you were as hard
upon the prisoners brought before yon! (Renetced
laughter.) Why, yon scarcely ever put on your little
cap, although it's most becoming! (Continued laughter.)
But to be serious. I repeat that there is nothing more
delightful than to assist at a really good trial, especially
if you are personally comfortable. Think of the entrance
of the prisoner. You put up your opera-glasses, and scan
his face. Is he pale t If so, how interesting! Does he
tremble? If he does—how perfectly sweet! (Applause.)
Then the evidence. Perhaps a child is examined, and
ories, not liking, of course, to denounce its own father!
What could be more charming than this! Then the
Counsel spar at one another, ana it's suoh fun! (Cheers.)
Or they are cross-examined, and isn't it a joke? (Re-
newed applause.) And then perhaps comes lunch.
(Laughter.) Yes, it is a pleasure when you have just a
nice little pile of freshly-cut sandwiches, and, say, half-a-
pint of sherry. (Cheers.) Still, I do think that the
Sheriffs might supply us with something better. (" With
a pint.'") They are nasty disagreeable old things there!
(Roars of laughter.)
A Sheriff (smiling). I beg pardon for interrupting,
but it is no part of our duty to provide a meal for our
fair friends.
Mist Trixy Gruesome (playfully). Oh, you naughty
man! I do not believe you a bit. (Laughter.) Then
after lunch (A Voice: "And the sherry.") Yes—
and the sherry—(roars of laughter)—after lunch and the
sherry, what can be more impressive than the eloquence of
the Counsel? Their voices are so grave, and tney often
say such beautiful things! And while you listen to
them you can watch the face of the accused through an
opera-glass while it changes its expression. (" Hear,
hear.' ) Then when the Judge sums up, the excite-
ment reaches its height. Is it to be Guilty or Not Guilty?
What is to be the fate of the interesting stranger in the
dock? Then, when the Jury retire to consider their ver-
dict, you have time to look round the Gallery to see if you
can discover the wife of the interesting stranger in the
dock. (A laugh.) You grow more and more excited,
until at last the twelve good men and true return and
deliver their verdict. It is Guilty, and you can guess
the rest! (Prolonged cheering.) Well, for this pleasant
day I thank the Judge and the Bar and the Jury. But
there is another who deserves my heartiest recognition.
He is not present, but his subtle influence pervades the
Court. He hovers about the Prisoner, in tne spirit, all
day long. It is the knowledge that he is waiting ready,
aye ready, to do his duty at a moment's notice that gives
the scene such a flavour of excitement and romance.
(Cheers.) What would the trial be without him?—flat
and stale and unprofitable. (Renewed applause.) Yes,
Ladies and Gentlemen, this excellent official is the com-
mencement and the finish, the Alpha and Omega of all
the proceedings. He stands near the Judge, walks whis-
pering to the Jury, and, as he gets close to the Prisoner's
side, turns him as pale as the whitest marble. And shall
we forget, this cilent, this ghostly friend? This spirit that

ncreases our pleasures and intensi-
ies our excitement? Shall we forget
rim when his obituary notice is a
column in length in the London
mper? No!—a thousand times no!
Ladies and Gentlemen, then, with
all my heart, I give you— the Com-
mon Hangman! (Scene closet in
upon the reception of the toast.)
What the hard-working public
official would say in reply is a matter
>f uncertainty. And as, fortunately,
lis utterances, although frequently
riven at great length in some quar-
ters, are interesting only to a tithe
of the Public, it is unnecessary to
pursue the matter further.
THE SACRIFICE OP THE
JUDGES.
(A moving Story of the Courts.)
IT was a day of deep anxiety. The
Judge and his two children sat in the
darkened room, nervously awaiting
the result of the Meeting of the Coun-
cil. The apartment was filled with
g-uide-books, guns, fishing-rods, and
Lists of Members of the Yachtinf
Clubs.
"Father, what shall we do ii
they make any alteration?" asked
HERBERT.
"I do not know, mv boy!" an-
swered his Lordship, gloomily. "1
have given you a comfortable ap-
pointment, and I think it is scarcely
fair to alter the conditions under
which you accepted it."
"Nay," repbed his son, gently;
"us I had to undergo an examination
before I could be called to the Bar
I know a great deal more law than
you who were not blessed with
similar discipline."
"True — very true!" murmurec
his parent.
"And, therefore, as I do know
more law than you, continued HER-
BERT, in a less gentle tone than be-
fore, as he was not pleased to be in-
terrupted, "I am of opinion that any
alteration that the Judges may maki
will not give me a cause of action."
"Very likely," said the Judge
sorrowfully, "I admit, my son, tha
this trouble has unhinged me. I fee
so prostrate, that the youngest of So-
licitors might almost knock me down
with a Statutory Mortgage deed!"
And then the old man was f airl;
overcome, and wept like a child.
"My own dearest father!" sai<
ALICE, throwing her arms about hi
Lordship's neck, "I cannot bear t

you? May it not be that any altera

have served so long and so worthily?
"Benefit of the Public!" cried th
veteran Lawyer, wildly. "Wha

balmy breeze on the Mediterranean
or drink in the sweet scent of th

VACATION JUDGES.
THEY HAVEN'T QUITE SETTLED IT, BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE THIRTEEN DAYS OFF

Then there was a pause, as a powdered footman brought in, on a salver, a telegram, and, falling
gracefully on one knee, presented the missive to his Lordship. Then the servitor retired.
"It comes from the Council of Judges," whispered the old Judge, trembling with emotion. "I
was not able to attend their Meeting, as you know they proposed to consider at it the poor four
or fiv» months we take for our little autumn holiday."
Then the old man put on his spectacles, and opened the telegram. He glanced at it, stared
wildly at it, and, uttering a fearful shriek, sank to the ground in a swoon.

"THE BIRDS" OF ARISTOPHANES.—It appears that the Aristophanic Burlesque to which Critics
when seeing modern burlesque, have so often and so learnedly referred, bears so strong a resemblance
to pantomime, that the comic " business," as one writer in the Standard candidly remarked, would
be " set down as padding, were it not the work of ARISTOPHANES." He was also astonished to find
in The Birds Greek puns. Not content with their Author's lines, the two Cantabs who played
Peisthetairos and Euelpides " introduced," to quote the same authority, "quips and quirks, much
as Mr. TOOLK does in English "—that is, these two amateurs were simply oi 707701 (the gaggers). The
language of the talking birds, by the way, must be a classic example of *r«a xrep<J«Ta.

LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business, and a IMle about their own. First, to
Mr. Wilson Barrett, of the Princess's, about '' Lords and Commons'
at the Haymarket, with a few incidental remarks on " Claudian."
MY DEAR BARRETT,
I AM so delighted with the notion of tho pamphlet-letter
written to you by Mr. GODWIN, F.S.A., and profusely illustrated by
that eminent Artist, that at this moment I cannot for the life of me
write to anybody else but you. It doesn't matter whom I have to
answer, or what I have to write about, I am compelled, by an irre-
sistible impulse, to write to you, my dear BARRETT, and tell you al
about it,—whatever it is. I know that, according to the first Epistle
of GODWIN to the Representative of Claudian, you and Mr. WILLS
and Mr. HERMAN, your Scenic Artists MARY HANN—beg pardon
I mean Mr. WALTER HANN—and Mr. STAFFORD Hall, also your
Costumiers, Madame AUOUSTE, Mr. BARTHE, and the Lady whose
name is suggestive of the Fisheries' Exhibition—Miss SMELT—are al
so deeply "interested in the Early Ages of Christianity" (Bles
'em!)—that it wUl be difficult to dis-
tract your attention from this absorbing
subject. You, my dear BARRETT, mus
be so taken uj*—excuse the Bow Stree
expression—with the sublimities o
your all-engrossing Art (have you ye
decided on any new picture-posters o
yourself as Ctaudian wherewith tc
murally decorate the Metropolis?) a:
to be unable to afford the time ti
make yourself acquainted with wha'
is going on outside the Princess's
Theatre. You will therefore thank mi
for telling you.
Mr. and Mrs. BANCROFT, who, yoi
may be aware, are the Managers o:
the Haymarket Theatre, not very far
from where yours is situated, have
recently produced a piece by Mr. PINERO
(who is an Actor as well as an Author
entitled Lords and Commons. As it ii
not classical, nor in any way associated
with Christianity, early or late, you
would not, just now, be much inte-
rested in it. It is beautifully put on
the Stage, the last Act being one of
the best " interiors" I have ever seen,
and I remember a good many. But there is no Earthquake.
The Critics were rather down upon the piece, though perhaps if
Mr. BANCROFT had adopted your judicious plan of taking the Critics
into his confidence at a Dress Rehearsal, the result might have been
slightly different. The Author has not protested, and so I presume
he is satisfied. If this hypothesis be correct, Mr. PINERO is very
easily pleased.
Lords and Commons is a piece written by an Actor for certain
Actors, not by a Dramatist for any Actors. It is as full of " charac-
ters as a German Reed Entertainment used to be, when each per-
former used to play two or three parts which were termed
Illustrations. It is badly constructed, as the audience, not being
let into the secret at tho commencement, are hostile to the Author.

Mri. B*rnard-Bier appropriately
draped.

Mrs. B. B. Flopping;—Devenish like Sarah B., eh f
An audience should never be left in the dark, except, of course,
for an Earthquake or some terrific effect of that sort, or for a
jhange of scene, when they may for once and away be in the his-
torical position of the Hebrew Law-giver on the occasion of the

candle being extinguished,—but excuse me for quoting this Semitic
precedent to you who are so deeply "interested in the Early Ages of
Christianity."
But to return to the Haymarket. Those of the dramatis persona
who represent the members of a Hanghty Aristocratic Family talk as
no Aristocrats out of the London Journal ever talked,—at least, I
hope not,—though I admit I have associated with so few 'aughty
families as not to be a thoroughly competent authority. The hero
of this piece. Lord Caryl, married, when he was very young, an
illegitimate daughter of some old Earl, and when he discovered
her illegitimacy, which it seems
he did a few days after the wed-
ding, he left her, and they never
met again for fourteen years, not,
in fact, until kind Mr. PINERO
brought them together in Caryl
Court, Haymarket, when the hus-
band did not recognise his long-lost
wife in Mrs. Devenish,—a name
which, my dear BARRETT, your
knowledge of Dorsetshire will tell
you is invariably associated with
Beer, and curiously enough it is
associated at the Haymarket with
Mrs. BERNARD-BEEHE. The Deve-
nish Beer at Weymouth is far more
satisfactory than the Mrs. BEEKE'S
Devenish at the Haymarket, who
behaves in a most objectionable
manner, and styles herself in a
vague sort of way "A Child of
the People"; so that, as she comes
to turn the 'Aughty Aristocrats
out of Caryl Court, this appellation
is suggestive of her being BECKY
Captain Tom Hawtree (Rip Van ISAACS the Sheriff's daughter,
Winkle Junior). "How did you the Woman in Possession. How-
Imow 'twas Hawtree P" "'Cos ever, old Lady Artful (admirably
I heard >«•?<>»«." played by Mrs. STIRLING), is
suddenly taken ill, can't be
moved, and has to be carried up again to her own bed-room and
attended by her daughter, a very stagy Aristocrat of the 'aughty
type, whose staginess is not toned down by Miss CALHOUN, though
the hard edges are taken off on the arrival of Mrs. BANCROFT, who.
as Miss Maplebeck, does her best to make things pleasant and natural
all round, and succeeds, I am bound to say, as only Mrs. BANCROFT
the Inimitable can. Unfortunately, Mist Maplebeck is no more
essential to the piece than are Mr. Chadd and Mr. Tredger, the
pantomime tradesmen, who will, of course, be furnished with their
legitimate business at
Christmas-time, and will
inmble over Mr. BROOK-
FIELD, wonderfully and
fearfully made up as old
Lord Percy Lewiscourt,
afterwards Clown, when-
)ver he lies down on the
threshold, and be picked
ip by Mr. ALFRED
BISHOP as Mr. Smee, the
Butler, afterwards Pan-
aloon. The Chorus of
Tradesmen to see the old
'amily out and the new
'amily in, is unworthy of
tfr. PINERO'S head as a
Dramatist, but does
credit to his heart as an
Actor with sympathies
or such of his fellow-
artists as are doomed to
'utility" and small
parts with "lines."

not immediately evident. Now, if instead of this, the Doctor, Mr.
ELLIOT, when he has that too brief scene with Mr. BANCROFT, were
permitted to say something about the Countess's lungs, then to mention
throat, and so lead up to voice, then Mr. PINEBO, to whom nothing
of this sort could possibly be a difficulty, could give him a few lines
to lead up to his song—a piano-accompaniment could be easily intro-
duced (BucAiOSSl "heard without")—and this would be, we venture
to say, the hit of the piece. Then, subsequently, the Doctor unseen,
at the "Prompt side," could sing the refrain of his song, in the last

Mr. BANCBOFT can join, and he can anticipate the rhymes in the good
old fashion, where the singer hesitates at the end of each verse. But,
my dear BAHRETT, I need not recall this "business" to a man of
your immense practical experience.
If Mr. PINERO wrote Mrs. Devenish for Mrs. BEERE, he is of
course gratified; if he didn't, then he can imagine the part being
better played. As it ia, I confess I was utterly astonished at Lord
Caryl's sudden ten-

opping, enforce-
ment - of - conj ugal
-rights sort of per-
son which the' 'Child
of the People" be-
comes in the hands
of Mrs. BERNARD
BEERE.
Why does Mr.
BANCHOFT insist
upon his name,
"JEEVOISE," being
pronounced as
spelt? Those who
call him "jEHVis"
are perfectly right,
and the quondam

about-town cannot
have forgotten the
proper pronunciation of his own name. You wouldn't have a
Tetrarch called a Tea-tray., at your classical establishment, would
you, my dear BARRETT?
And now, having posted you up (fancy my "posting you up," as
if you hadn't been posted up enough all over the town for the last
year!) in what's going on at the Haymarket, I may take leave to
congratulate you on the result of your tirst representation of Claudian.
The prologue is one of the brightest things I "ve seen for some time;
the remainder of the play about the dullest. But you, my dear BAB-
BITT, or your dear HERMAN the Plottist, must have provided at least
one of the Critics with a book of the words at thatjudicious Dress
Rehearsal, or with extracts, as next day I saw the '' Holy Clement's"
cuss in full in the Daily Telegraph. How did the Holy Clement's
words get verbatim into that journal? I met with it elsewhere also.
Mind you, you 're quite right; all Critics ought to have the book
beforehand, so as to judge of its literary merits; but no Critics of any
position should go to a Dress Rehearsal. The Eminent Hand who does
the Theatrical Notices for the Times was for deifying you and your
talented assistants; he was for writing up over the door of the
Princess's,'' Enter boldly, for here, too, there are Gods,"—which I see
you now quote among your numerous advertisements,—only, now I
come to consider it, I fancy that he must have meant this as a suitable
inscription for the entrance to the Gallery. But he should have
inserted "bypayment or with an order" after "Enter boldly," or
else the visitor would be chucked out in about two twos, whatever
might be his admiration for the classics. The Eminent Times Hand
should be aware by now that you can't " enter boldly" even into the
Gallery of the House, not among "the Gods," but the Reporting
Angels, without a pass. I must try and hear Claudian again, unless
I can get a book of it, so as to judge of Mr. WrLLS*s dialogue.
But as to Mr. HERMAN'S plot, though the Eminent Hand above-
mentioned would place its compiler in the "foremost rank of drama-
tists," it seemed to me to be, with the exception of the strikingly
dramatic prologue, a jumble of such ancient materials as The Wan-
dering Jew, The Last Days of Pompeii, The Flying Dutchman, and
CHAKLES DICXENS'S Haunted Man, or the Ghost's Bargain, and as
monotonous and uninteresting as a Panorama of the Essex Marshes
in the time of JULIUS C.S:SAB, except for a dash of old transpontine
melodramatic colour, when the Tetrarch (looking rather like a shabby
IBVING) amused me a little. I think that if the part of the Blind
Girl could have been played by Miss MABT ANDEBSON (for example),
I should have liked it better. Miss EASTLAXE seemed to me, my
dear BABBETT, to be doing nothing but clutching at her drapery,
and grinning horribly. If this were .a first night's nervousness, 1
sincerely pity her, and hope that the next: time I witness this
performance she will have got over it, and be able to give me some
'dea of what the part should be beyond an hysterical imitation of
Mr. GEORGE BABBETT, in The Silver King, staggering about sideways
and plaintively calling out " Master! Master. Capital oompanion-
aictures for your posters, my dear BABBETT.—Miss EASTLAXE, as
Almida. crooning "Master! Master!" and Mr. GEOBBE BABHETT
as the Old Servant in The Silver King, with his " Missy! Missy!"
As for your Earthquake, my dear BABBETT, it is simply " no great
shakes." Yours, NIBBS.
THE FAIRYLAND EEVIEW.
THE Fairies haven't done their work, and ftueen Titania grieves—
Her faithful subjects buried are beneath the Christmas Leaves!
A thousand festive fairy pens once more their course pursue,
To note the Christmas Harvest for the Fairyland Review.
There's ALICE WEBER'S pretty tale, The Old House in the Square,
Which M. E. EDWABDS illustrates with gracefulness and care:
GRIMM'S Household Stories you will find a fund of fairy lore.
With coloured cuts by WEHNEBT which you '11 gladly linger o'er.
And School Girls, every girl at school undoubtedly will please,
With tales'of girls of every clime—French, Grecian, Japanese.
While KINGSTON'S, whose Adventures in India compels
Each boy to listen eagerly to everything he tells!
The Marvels of the Polar World, its snow and ice and cold,
And all its charms and horrors, are by ROBEBT ROUTLEDGE told.
All children will be pleased enough, we venture to assume,
With FRANCES PEABD'S bright story of the Ashledon School-room.
But Every Soy's, it is a book that every youth enjoys—
E. ROUTLEDGE is par excellence',ihe editor for boys!
The Minstrels is a merry book, and so is Pantomime,
With countless pretty pictures and bright melodious rhyme.
Two Little Friends, Young Coasters too, likewise The Old Farm Gate,
With Little Birds and Snowflakes are, by youngsters, thought first-
rate.
In' lively Lazinella and other Drawing-room Plays,
We 've naught for E. L. BLANCHABD but the heartiest of praise!
And budding drawing-room actors the cunning hands will bless
Of YABDLEY, and of BABXER too, and Mrs. MACKABJITJIAS.
Poultry Keeping is a handy book, its pages will reveal
Some valuable wrinkles by the author, SAMUEL BEALE;
He tells you from experience—his facts you can't gainsay—
Both how to keep your cocks and hens, and how to make 'em pay!
With KINGSTON'S Powder Monkey how delighted boys will be.
With STABLES' Wild Adventures, and with ADAMS' Shore and Sea.
They '11 pore o'er THATER'S Washington, and LIEFDE'S Beggars, too,
And likewise read his Brave Resolve, with close attention, through.
Let's gaze on LETTS'S Diaries, let 's cordially own.
They 're better now than ever, for he ne'er lets well alone!
In True Tales for my Grandsons, Sir SAMUEL BAKER writes,
And HENNESSEY well illustrates some thrilling scenes and sights!
But ANDEBSEN'S brave Stories for the Household, there's no doubt,
Each youngster who can read and rave will read and rave about.
Miss MAYO s Thoughts and Stories girls undoubtedly will choose,
And Mrs. BACKER'S Coward, boys will eagerly peruse;
While FBTTH'S smart tale of Unac, they '11 devour it with zest,
And Tempest-tossed they '11 find to be of striking interest.
A truce to all this studying: we 'd fain sing Tra-la-la!
And find out what is " on the Cards," and do the Card-i-da!
The treasures HILDESHEIMEB sends we cannot half disclose,
In calendars, and floral wreaths, and brave portfolios;
In etchings of the Isis, and in photos of the Lakes,
Variety is wonderful in all he undertakes!
And NATHAN sends us snowy scenes, and robin-redbreasts too,
With babies and with butterflies in pink, in white, and blue;
With studies by the summer sea, and views upon the Thames;
And WALLIS sends with MEISSNER some rare artistic gems.
While LUKS has figure subjects fit for albums and for books,
With wondrous coloured photographs—in fact, objets de luxe!
Now if perchance you 're captious, we are very sure that you
Will never rue the gorgeous cards you get from DE LA RUE!
The classic and the sporting scenes, BBsthetic and Chinese,
And those palateable palettes are ever sure to please;
With diaries and calendars, compact and picturesque.
Designed to suit the mantelpiece, the pocket, or the desk.
But stay, the fairy ink is dry, split is the fairy quill,
The fairy fingers inky and the fairy song is still!
The fairy spirit weary and the fairy brain perplext,
So further revelations are—" continued in our next!"

MT DKAH DUCHESS,
I AM so much obliged for your letter. The game was just a
"leetle" but there, I know you wanted to trv the Parcels Post.
I sent most of it as a present to the Company. 'What a week I 've
had! Dinner to-night at Lady AWEBEERI s has been my_ first glimpse
of " orderly comfort." The excellent Miss POSTEB, my indefatigable
Manageress, transformed again, like Cinderella at the Prince's Ball,
and wreathed in smiles, as it' she never could lose her tempter. I 've
really no time to send you my "reflections," as you so kindly ask
me. The twenty-four hours are fully occupied with learning by heart,
rehearsing, thinking of one's clothes, eating, and sleeping. The
notice-board at our Theatre is more like a Kaleidoscope than any-
thing else—it changes about every day, and I am "cast "for this,
that, and the other, like a conjuring trick. I don't think that the
Stage as a profession is quite up to what I had imagined it to be,—
but then, of course, I 'm working my way up, and nope to emerge
somewhere satisfactorily.
I was very nervous the first night, but I was quite determined to
say my lines on the Stage after having said them so often to GEOEGE.
Mr. DEBWENTWATEE didn't seem to think my dying confessions, as
the Earl, necessary to the piece, and so he skipped over them, and
went on with a speech of his that ought to come afterwards,—but
I thought I would confess all the same. I 'm afraid I rather inter-
rupted hit solicitations for pardon and expressions of sorrow for his

ill-spent life, by beginning my confession in the middle of it. The
audience didn't seem averse to a duet, although Mr. DEBWENTWATEB
was much huffed after the performance.
When I got back to our little dressing-room, tired and hot with my
exertions. I found Messrs. GABBICK and DEBWENTWATEB evidently
upset. Now I was quite satisfied with my first night's work before
an impartial audience; many a shrill whistle and other signs of
encouragement had I received from the Gallery. I had done my
best. However. Mr. DERWENTWATEB didn't like me at all as the
Coachman, or the General; he thought my rendering of the Earl
"cruel"; the Arab Guide (who only has to say two words in Arabic
and then gets stabbed), and Sea Captain (who only dances a quad-
rille) he thought might just pass muster. As for my Prison Warder,
he expressed himsell strongly and said, " Bad, Sir; d—d bad." He
then very kindly entered into a lot of advice, which, he told'me,
was for my own good. "It will be better for yourself." he kept
saying; and as far as I could make out, it would be better for
myself " if I never turned my face to the audience, kept well at the
back of the Stage with him in front of me, and left out half my lines.
Now, Mr. GABBICK (who had been very busy making a free use of
my vaseline all this time to get my wig-paste off his face) gave it as
hit opinion that I 'd no business on the Stage at all. His idea seemed
to be that no one with any private resources, however small, ought to
be on the Sta.ge, and that the Profession should be entirely filled by
men with wives and large families to support on their salaries,
quite irrespective as to whether they had any natural ability or not.
Education and love of the Art he called very bad names. You 'II
never do any good," said he. "Why, look at me! I 've been twenty-
three years in the Profession, and thai's the only way to make an
Actor, Sir. I 've been married this twelve years.
Now, I wonder if I shall have got on as well as Mr. GABBICK in
twenty-three years' time! I can't nelp thinking, although it is most
kind of these Gentlemen to take so much interest in me, that being
able to afford a few ordinary comforts must be a help if one wants to
study Art. If one is obliged to work so hard with a hammer and
nails, and be most of the day in one's shirt-sleeves, like the Stage
Manager, one can't devote so much time to quiet study, or pay
sufficient attention to refining one's mind and style of acting; perhaps
I 'm wrong, though.
Mr. GARBICK and Mr. DEBWENTWAXES went on talking at me (for my
good) till they were Ulstered-up again ready for the street. They both
agreed I 'd better '' chuck it up," and I said'' thank you;" but I shan't
chuck it up, and I settled in my mind to do just the same next night
as I had done that. I don't learn lines to have them cut out.
Miss POSTEB said that as my friends were coming on Wednesday,
she would give me parts that stood well out in the plays that night,
and not so many of 'em. I was to be Robert FfolKott and Sir Lei-
cester Deadlock. The following night I was to be Bernardo, Guild-
enstein, the Second Actor, anal Osric, in Hamlet, and a villain in
Kathleen Mavourneen; Saturday, the British Consul in Demerara,
in British Born; and Miss POSTEB hoped I wouldn't mind blacking
my face to play a nigger in Dred. I thought my week seemed
pretty well cut out, but perhaps I was lucky not to be cast for any of
the manual work.
Miss POSTER tells me I am a great anxiety to her, and that some
people would be glad to pay .a premium for the opportunities she
gives me; but I think as lonjj; as I am able to fulfil the parts she
fives me to the apparent satisfaction of the audience, and work

entertain anybody, instead of being overworked, underpaid, or not-
paid-at-all drudges! Perhaps I am not very well to-day, for I don't
seem to be taking a very lively view of my profession.
I suppose I shall find out where the Art comes in, but at present,

he ducked, as in angular

such deeds wasn't ripe;

DEAD LEAVES.
WE are true lovers of old books. We do love to bury ourselves
amongst their leaves, in company with great ones of the past, now
silent except in the quiet eloquence of type: and though our lot be
oast amongst the ink-spillers, affect the wisdom of others, as we wax
older, far more than our own. It is pleasant to escape into the nooks
and corners of the Past out of the Present's full and noisy thorough-
fares, where the burning questions of the day jostle in paragraphs
against the latest gathering at Lord JONES'S country-house, and the
gloomy metaphysician, who gays he embodies the Age, but looks
as if it brought him in but little, stumbles against the portly
Editor of a Society journal, who winks sagaciously, as who
would say that he has his own ideas of what the Age likes
best. He has, in fact, an air much as if life were well worth
living; while the metaphysician, though with his literary teeth
scarce cut, is a distinct warning that there are circumstances
under which it is not. When he grows older, may he see the error
of his ways, and edit a Society journal. For the generation which
would fain be thought clever for pretending to read him for an hour
of a morning, makes amends by a deep draught of personal para-
graphy afterwards, and winds up in the evening with the subtle wit
of Humpty-Dumpty, the famous Messrs. UAMMKK and GUBTON'S
last new Comic Opera. Meantime, 0 Metaphysician, mark this, and
perpend! We that are frivolous, yet humbly of the old faiths, have
two worlds to make the brightest of, or hope so. You have but one,
and pay attention to its glooms. If you are right, and we wrong,
when the end comes we have had the best of that one world of yours;
but if you be wrong, and we right, might it not be said, as with the
Clown, "Where are we thenf" You are well-informed, and we,
thank Heaven 1 are not. But what of that P It is better to live in
a fool's paradise, than in a wise man's purgatory.
But our pen wanders from our purpose (being a pen essentially so
prone), which was this. To wonder if the world and the ages ever
really change at all, among those our excursions into old books. The
corners which we love the best, perhaps, are the lesser and least
remembered writings of great men. Among them, as is but natural,
we find embedded strange bright pearls of thought and of expression
—for such men never care to be niggardly, and can afford to throw
their pearls away—which, lacking the brilliant settings of the men'i
more famous gems, are apt to shrink quietly away into their modest
shells, to reward only at times the search of a casual explorer. If he
be of the modern advertising order, he can parade it for his own, and
perhaps live long on the price of it.
It is but a week or two since that we dug for Mr. Punch, out of
the Goldsmith mine, some strange passages that moved us to rub our
eyes, and ask in what century we were living. Why, they are all in
those autumn-stained pages:—Critics and Metaphysicians, Sophists
and Fashionables, burning questions and all! Have not the Marquis
of SQUALLSBUBT and the terrible Mr. RISINQSTJN, Sir GRAVE ETRES,
and my Lord GRETHAIRS, all suddenly discovered, within the last few
weeks (though certainly with no view to votes—oh, dear no!), what
is the pressing national need of the hour ?—of course, a new one?
We had been pondering with the rest of the world upon the novel
problem of the poor's housing,—with which ground-rents and empty
palaces, and huge untenanted estates covering so insignificant a pro-
portion of this enormous island, have of course nothing to do—land
again we say, oh, dear no!)—when in turning for relief to thus*
old-world readings of ours, and trying to forget for a time the
miseries proper to our period, we read in the off-pages of one who is

now a past-master in the great world's Masonic system, even the following words, and
rubbed our eyes again:—
"What a confession it is that we have almost all of us been obliged to make! A clever and
earnest-minded writer gets a commission from the Morning Chronicle newspaper, and reports upon
the state of our poor in London; he goes among labouring people and poor of all kinds—and brings
back what F A picture of human life so wonderful, so awful, so piteous and pathetic, so exciting and
terrible, that readers of romances own they never read anything like to it; and that the griefs, struggles,
strange adventures here depicted, eiceed anything that any of us could imagine. Yes; and these
wonders and terrors have been lying by your door and mine ever since we had a door of our own. We
had but to go a hundred yards off and sec for ourselves, but we never did .... Of the workmen we
know nothing, how pitilessly they are ground down, how they live and die, here close by us at the
back of our houses, until some Poet like HOOD wakes and sings that dreadful 'Sony of tht Shirt';
some prophet like CARLYLE rises up and denounces woe, some clear-sighted energetic man like the
writer of the Chronicle travels into the poor man's
country for us, and comes back with his tale of
terror and wonder. Awful, awful poor man's
country!"
We rubbed our eyes, and wondered. Was
this real? Were we not reading of the
question of this day? Was not the Chronicle
a misprint for a later sheet? Was the clever
and earnest-minded writer one Mr. BITTER
CRT in the P. M. G. t And the prophet,
could he be, perchance, the Marquis of
SOTAI.LSBTJRY? No. For we were reading- of
the question of another day, in lines which
appeared many years ago in these very
paijes—the pages of Mr. Punch; and were
written by a great man with a very great
heart, of which the lesser knew not. And
the name of that man was THACXERAY.
Alas! is not the problem this—that the
Poor we have always with us, Lord SQUAIXS-
BURY is very seldom with us, but, as a rale,
rather against us, or we are against him.
But, be that as it may, might not Lord
SQTULLSBUBY himself, after stirring the
question in political reviews, think of a
new solution? We have heard, though we
can ill believe it, that the great house of
Capfield stands sometimes empty, with its
miles of unembarrassed air about it. Might
not a detachment of these same Poor, in one
of those seignorial absences, be "housed"
there, with good supervision, once, just by
way of experiment? The idea sounds shock-
ing. But, after all, why not? You have
raised the ever-walking ghost again, my
Lord. Might you not try that much to
lay it? MABJUS.
A REFLECTIVE ODE.
So thus it ends,—a poet Peer !—
And as I drop my lyre and gaze
On this my largest, latest blaze,
I wonder wh'at my work is here!
Will this grave bench on which I sit
Prove harder than my poet's chair ?—
This gaudy head-gear that I wear
But fret me with a faulty fit'(
Will too, when breaks the opening throng
Of crushing Commons' 'gainst the bar,
Some cynic sight me from afar,
And shameless shout, " A song! a song!"
And shall I, swept by force of vears.
Uprise and drown the Speaking Throne
With matchless music,—till I 'm shown
The door amidst derisive jeers!
Or shall I find no lyric vent,
But leaving mute my muzzled Muse,
Her sweetest, saddest measures fuse
In mere Content or Non- Content?
But. there—I trust that somehow good
Will come of timely honour yet,
And genius prove for coronet
As good a mate as Norman blood.
For why should I not take my seat?
Not first am I to reach the void
Where tinsel has great souls decoyed,
And made their rounded lives complete.
A Peerage! If it be but vain
To hand to son what earns the sire,
Then have I thrumm'd no fruitful lyre,
Nor much subserved another's gain.
Yet, though I know not everything,
I somehow guess this news will fall
At last as welcome news to all,
And get to have a pleasant ring.*
Thus runs my dream! So here am I,
My coronet about to don,
Half hoping, when I 've got it on,
It will not sit too much awry!
• I think IRVING will be pleased if I take it.
But between the Cup, &c., &c.—A. T.

OLD FRIENDS."
EXUBERANT RAPTURE DISPLAYED BY THE JONESES ON READING ix THE TIMES
THAT SMITH, THEIK OLDEST AND DEABEST FKIEND, HAD AT LAST BEEN
MADE A K.C.B.
THREE CHEERS! AND VIVE LA CORPORATION!
THE Corporation somehow have the knack of always
doing the right thing at the right time, and in the right
way. Seeing with regret the somewhat strained relations
at the present time between the two great Western
Powers, England and France, in regard to China, they
eagerly seize the first opportunity that offers to pour oil,
as it were, upon the somewhat troubled waters, and they
do it in their own peculiar, hut eminently satisfactory way.
Having resolved to place upon the pedestals at Black-
friars Bridge, statuary, in the highest style of Art, they
have selected for the first subject, FB.ANCIS THE FIRST,
King of France! The statue was to have been tried yes-
terday, but on what charge we are unable to say. We
hope it was acquitted and let oft. But if condemned to
remain, the inscription, it is said, will be in both lan-
guages, and will run as follows:—
"England and France! France and England! root and
branch, and may they continue and flourish for ever!"
[" La France et V Angleterrc, 1} Angleterre et la
France, ratine et branches, et ytttUat contmuent etfleur-
rissent djamais ! "]
EAHL GRANVILLE is said to be so much pleased at the
brilliancy of the idea, which is reported to have origin-
ated with the new LORD MAYOK; that the Baronetcy that
usually follows upon distinguished services or Royal
visits is considered to be already assured.
IT is said that if Mr. TENXYSON is made a Peer, he will
be an ornament to the House of Lords. Will he? Not
in that hat and "auld cloak" of his. Here is a chance
for a Testimonial from Genuine Admirers. 'Boots might
be included,—latest Masher style,—and the sooner this is
set on foot the better.
"THE Late Sunsets!" exclaimed Mrs. RAMSBOTHAM.
"The sunsets have been very remarkable, but I haven't
noticed their being particularly late."
NEW RUXE OF THE HOUSE.—If Mr. AB.THUK PEEL'S
appointment as Speaker be confirmed, the first Member
wno says that " the House is now turned into a Court of
A. PEEL," will be fined or clocktowered.
THE HEALTH EXHIBITION.
ME. PUNCH is delighted to hear that the arrangements for next
year's Show at South Kensington are progressing famously. Here
are some of the items expected to prove most attractive to visitors :—
Everybody who passes the turnstiles will be entitled to have his or
her pulse felt by the President of the Royal College of Physicians,
at least once a day!
A Medicine-and-Pill-Tasting Pavilion will be provided gratis;
skilled Surgeons will also perform operations at a greatly reduced fee.
Dealers in cheap descriptions of wine will be allowed every facility
for recommending their vintages, by means of samples to be drunk on
the premises, on condition that they also supply convenient mortuaries
in the grounds.
Among'the Exhibitors in the British Section will be:—
Sir Wilfrid Lawson.—The Great Temperance Pick-me-up.
The Dean of Bangor.—Beetroot Syrup, the Substitute for Tea.
The London Water Companies.—A few of the largest and most
interesting animals to be found in ordinary drinking-water.
The Licensed Victuallers' Association.—The exact amount of hops
in a gallon of beer (through a microscope).
Dr. Richardson.—Specimen of a really Healthy Room, with no
carpet, a great deal of ventilation, no dust, and no furniture to
harbour any.
There will be a Great International Health Competition, under the
highest medical supervision. The healthiest person will receive a
prize of £500, on condition that he attends daily m a special chamber,
and consents to show his tongue to the visitors at least once in each
quarter-of-an-hour. _
No Attendants will be permitted who are not in robust health.
Certificates from their Parish Doctors will be required to this effect.
Any Attendant catching a cold will catch it; a cough will lead to
instant dismissal.
Doctors who disagree with each other will be allowed to go into a
special chamber, and fight out their differences. Admission to this
apartment will be high.
There will be a Chamber of (Sanitary) Horrors! Here will be
found Specimens of Houses with bad draining, Houses with no drain-
ing at all, Easy Methods of connecting the cistern with the main-
drainage system, and wax models of the following':—Jerry-Builders
who use bad mortar, Butchers who have been fined more than three
times a month for selling "unsound" meat, People who don't con-
sume their own smoke. Tobacconists, Writers in the Lancet, Medical
Officers of Health, and the Man who invented Zoedone.
Each week a Conversazione will be held,' under Distinguished
Patronage, when Essays will be read, and Discussions take place 9n
various Sanitary Matters. For instance, a Distinguished Person will
state how he feels after running five miles and then eating a hearty
supper; and other Distinguished Persons will then state how they
feel, and very Distinguished Doctors will then say irhy everybody
feels as they do feel, and so on. Among the papers already promised
are some on the following topics :—
On the kinds of filters which are actually deadly, and those which
are only extremely dangerous to life.
Does boiling diluted sewage render it a safe drink for invalids 'f
Whether a course of temperance beverages, adulterated sherry, or
a leap from the Monument, is most likely to end in sudden death.
The Twopenny Dinner, of Soup, Fish, Two Entrees, Joint, and a
Choice of Sweets or Cheese, with Beer or Wine, all included, is
expected to be one of the " hits " of the Exhibition.
Pugilistic Encounters will take place three times a day between
individuals brought up respectively on—(a) Water and Beer; (b) Beef
and Lentils; and between (c) Early Risers and Late Risers.
Fountains of Apollinaris Water will play in the grounds, but
Visitors will be expected to bring their own brandy-flasks. At
stated intervals the leading London Doctors will give exhibitions of
their skill in Diagnosis, on selected patients from Infirmaries, to the
music of a Special Band supplied from the Hospital for Incurables.
[N.B.—To prevent disappointment, Mr. Punch begs to say at once
that at the close of the Exhibition no Baronetcies or honours of any
sort will be given away to anybody connected with the arrangements.]

DROPT the wizard pencil,rresting
That unchilled, untiring hand!
Should some sorrowing Fay come
questing
From the Court of Fairyland,
Come inquiring among mortals
For another fit to pass
Through those dim sequestered portals,
Fit that realm to type and glass,
Of its wealth to be possessor.
Humour's harvest, Fancy s spoil,
Where should she find right successor
To unrivalled RICHARD DOTLE?
Why must so fine necromancy
Know the arresting touch of death?
"Why must world-delighting fancy
Bide at last the icy breath?
So love asks with noble folly,
Running o'er his mimic world,
Creatures winsome, quaint, and jolly,
Arabesquely blown and twirled
From his pencil point profusely.
Scattered like the flowers of Spring,
Lightly, lavishly and loosely,
When DOYLE'S wit is on trie wing.
On the wing! 'Tis ever on it,
All unlike the little bard
Who excogitates a sonnet
After labour long and hard.
RICHARD DOYLE. (IN MEMORIAM.)
He is no pedestrian plodder,
Double-handed he deals out:
Whimsies wilder, brighter, odder
Never swarmed in Fancy's rout.
DRAYTOX'S old Nymphidia never
Was more populous of whims
Than the limbo opened ever
When this wizard dreams and limns.
"Wood-notes wild " the analogues are
Of his quaint and elfish crew.
Who makes question if the rogues are
Anatomically true?
They 're alive and love-inspiring,
Which some fresco-frights are not;
Age with childhood comes admiring,
Cold correctness counts " great rot."
Living fun and fancy spoil us
For the coldly critic strain;
'Gainst them Academic Zoilus
Blows his counterblasts in vain.
Not the imps of Elf-land merely
Populate his pictured page;
Who drew bow more keenly, queerly,
At the follies of bis age?
Winged with whim, and tipped with wild-
ness,
Straight withal his arrows flew;
Satire sharp with genial mildness
Mingled in the world he drew.
THACKERAY'S Colonel fits his pencil,
But his sharper skill can shape,
Sans long nose or tail prehensile,
Cad, or snob, or human ape.
Turning o'er his own past pages,
Punch, with tearful smile, can
trace
That fine talent's various stages,
Caustic satire, gentle grace,
Feats and freaks of Cockney funny—
BROWN, and JONES, and ROBINSON;
And, huge hive of Humour's honey,
Quaint quintessence of rich fun,
Coming fresh as June-breeze briary
With old memories of our youth—
Thrice immortal Pipe's Diary!
Masterpiece of Mirth and Iruth!
Olden ties unknit too quickly
Take new charm as we review
Fancy's wit-world thronged so thickly.
Mors, who has so much to do,
Might, one dreams, give longer tether
Unto lives that keep so young.
Heads of wood and hearts of leather
Freely in his way are flung.
No! He will not long^ be cheated
Of the choicest of his spoil,
To the further shore has fleeted
Fancy's favourite—" DICKY DOYLE."
THE SENTRY OF THE CENTURY.
"SLIPPERS FOR SOLDIERS.
—As one of the results of
recent committee work on
equipment, it has been de-
cided, says the Army and
Navy Gazette, that a pair of
light canvas waterproof
slippers will be carried by
the soldier in his valise on
active service, instead of a
second pair of boots, which
will be carried in the first
line of transport. A small
supply of spare boots will
accompany each battalion,
to replace the few that may
be prematurely worn out.
It has been found that troops
can keep the field, in a
rough country, on one pair
of boots for two months, and
it is believed that the addi-
tion of light canvas shoes,
to put on when the boots
have been removed, to ease
the feet, will answer all
requirements."—Globe.

SOME SIGNS OF THE SEASON.
Now, do wealthy and careful men and women seize hold of some
habit displayed by their poorer relations, habits of which they have
said nothing during the year, as an excuse for never seeing or speak-
ing to those impoverished relations again.
Postmen who have lingered and loitered with your letters for
eleven months, now not only deliver them at the appointed time, but,
in their kindly zeal, are anxious to open, read, and answer them for
you.
Dyspeptics look forward to their waking condition on the 26th with
feelings of agony and apprehension.
Norfolk poultry-farmers drink success and long continuance to
good old English customs.
Descriptive Writers arm themselves with Maps of London, and
evolve articles headed, "Roast Beef in Bermondsey," "Turkey and
Sausages in Wapping," and "Mince Pies in Spitalfields."
The lesser feminine lights of the Stage invest in five shillings'
worth of illuminated cards, and sit anxiously down awaiting a crop
of bangles, bracelets, diamond butterflies, boxes of bonbons, and
eighteen-button gloves.
Railway Porters become 'suddenly intelligent, and convinced that
every traveller by every train desires a compartment to himself.
Heroic sacrificers of the truth avow openly that they have ghosts
in their families capable of putting all the annuals in the shade, and
that they themselves have seen them.
Tradesmen order in several reams of note-paper and a few gross of
blue envelopes.
Cabmen salute their fares with'cheery"remarks as to the season-
ableness of the weather.
Schoolmasters are praying that Classics. Modern Languages,
Mathematics, History, and Geography could all be classed as extras.
Fond lovers buy and give to each other the very last things in the
world that each other wants.
Fashionable preachers drink much strong tea, in the hope of
eliciting something fresh from their brains.
Men in possession are sure that everything'can be settled comfort-
ably, and that.nobody wants to do any harm to anybody else.
Pictures representing bright, crisp, exhilarating, frosty weather,
are in large demand.
Umbrellas, Waterproofs, and Respirators, to protect the human
frame from rain, slush, mud, and fog, are in enormous request.
Daring young Journalists, early in the morning, wildly wonder
what effect on Society would an article, commencing ".This, the most
loathsome season of the year" have, and conclude not to write it,
but to go to bed.
Publicans arrange that the most generous and lavish of their
regular customers shall win the goose in their Annual Club.
Elderly people raise highly successful blue devils for themselves by
recalling the friends they have lost.
Blue-Ribbonites swear off on account of the season of the year.
Anti-Blue-Ribbonites swear on harder and harder on account of
the season of the year.
Starving street Arabs and ordinary paupers are all at once dis-
covered to be hungry.
Several nervous imaginative invalids become chronic imbeciles,
through being waked up at dead of night by the strains of the
"Mistletoe Bough."
Hypochondriacal subjects trust that they will be in their coffins
before the New Year's festivities set in.
Mr. Punch comes out as usual, and without the cynicism with
which it is now fashionable to regard this kindly genial season, wishes
all his Readers as Merry a Christmas—as they deserve.
REALLY!
AT the ensuing Balls at the Mansion House a new dance will be
introduced, which it is expected will achieve great popularity. It
will be called the " Conger Reel."

VOICE of the golden past! The Stage grows dark,
The End has come, and slow the curtain falls.
MABIO is dead! It cannot he, for hark!
His name is echoed in repeated calls.
Long we have lost him, but fond memory slips
Back to the days his song so glorified;
His magic fame falls from a thousand lips-
Music grew dumh the day that MARIO died!
Knight of the silver song! "Who can forget
Your Almaviva f—for his beauty glows
In recollection—ah! the grand duet
With glorious GRISI in The Huguenots.'
"Ah! mio Fernando .'" that was song sublime,
And Favorita's ecstasy complete,
When, with a passion that has conquered time,
The tyrant sword fell at your noble feet!
King of the hearts of all! With folded arms,
As white-robed priest, by Leonora's cell
You stand in fancy, whilst the myriad charms
Come with love-music and your magic spell!
"Anffiol' a"Amor' !" that was the song you sung
In tragic torture of accented pain.
MARIO, my Master, would that we were young,
To see enchanted women weep again!
Man of the deathless voice! How they will greet
The lost companion who returns to them—
RUBINI and GIUGLINI, honey-sweet,
Will swell the chorus for your requiem.
When the last portals to be passed by men
Are fired with melody—amidst the glow
Song's immortality will triumph, then
GHISI at last will meet her MAJUO!
Beware of the Mole.
THE Metropolitan Mole, which burrows through every
part of London; is likely to receive a check. Subter-
ranean London is now so pierced, tunnelled, and honey-
combed, that the respectable householder may wake up
some fine morning and find he is in his own coal-cellar,
with the chance of going further. The Mole, however,
made a mistake when he turned his attention towards
the Parks. The Metropolis has so few lungs remaining,
that these must be jealously protected; and London is
thoroughly aroused to the necessity of making a vigorous
stand against permitting the Mole to even look at the
Parks. The war-cry is, "No Larks with the Parks!"
UNIVERSITY INTELLIGENCE.

OXFORD, DECEMBER, 23.
THE next examination for the Tooleian Provincial Company's
Travelling Fellowship will be held on the 13th of January next.
Intending candidates are requested to send their photographs, list
of parts, press notices, and other certificates, together with a stamped
envelope, under cover, to " The Rev. the Acting Manager, All Souls,"
on or before the 1st prox.
At a Convocation held yesterday it was decided to grant the
prayer of the Provost of Oriel, the Master of Pembroke, and the
Warden of Wadham, that they might be allowed to renew their
present engagement at an East End London Theatre, and continue
their successful impersonation of the Three Witches in Macbeth for
a still further run of six nights.
Two carpet and bolster exercises for the Degree of Doctor of Lofty
Tumbling were performed on Tuesday afternoon at the Sheldonian
Theatre with some success in the presence of the Vice- Chancellor and
a small but friendly assemblage.
The subject selected for the forthcoming Newdigate Prize Poem

CAMBRIDGE, DECEMBER 23.
THE Examiners for the Special Examination in Vampire and other

Applied Mechanics (honoris causa?).
At a Congregation to be held at noon to-morrow, it will be pro-
posed "that half the travelling expenses incidental to the Vice-
chancellor's recent unsuccessful appearance at Worthing as Romeo,
be defrayed from the University Chest." Some opposition is
expected.
The Examination for the Chancellor's Medals for Pantomime busi-
ness will commence on Monday next. Attention is specially directed
to the fact that the Examiners will, in adjudging the order of merit,
attach much importance to the quality of the VvcA Voce, and expect
the answers delivered from the large pasteboard heads of the Candi-
dates to be full, round, clear, and of a character to be distinctly

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHAKIVAEL

GLAD, MY LORD, YOU HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO CHANGE YOUR HAT!"
NOTES OF INTERROGATION.
READING the various and conflicting accounts of Mr. HENRY
IBVINO'S first appearance in Boston, U.S., JWr. Punch feels himself
placed in the position of HERODOTUS. The historian heard eight
or ten different descriptions of an occurrence that took place under
his window, and as none of them agreed with his own observation,
he asked himself how he could possibly write history. TVTien Mr.
Punch has nothing better to do than writing the history of IRVINS'S
American tour, he will want to know how he is to reconcile the
following statements:—
London Times, December 12, 1883:—
"Mr. HENRY Invixo made a very successful appearance at Boston yester-
day in Louii the Eleventh before a large audience, which included the leading
citizens. The chief Boston newspapers publish long criticisms upon the
performance, describing the warm and enthusiastic reception of the great
actor, and the profound impression made by him."
London Daily Telegraph, same date:—
"Mr. HEXRY IRVIVO made his first appearance in Boston last night, in
the character of Louts the Eleventh. The theatre, which is the largest in
America, was crowded, and the performance was altogether n magnificent
success."
The London Standard, same date:—
"Mr. TRVINO has appeared in Boston as Louis the Eleventh. The audi-
ence was of a high character and lar^e, hut the house was not full. The
actor met with a kind reception, but the audience only became enthusiastic
after the Fourth Act. when Mr. IRVIXO was recalled several times. The
newspaper critics in Boston deny that he has genius, but they praise his
industry."
Critics may and do differ as to their opinions, but reporters ought
not to differ as to their facts. Which is right? But—after all—
who cares'?

LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About OOier People's Business. (1) To S. B. Bancroft, Esq. (2) To
J. L. Took, Esq. (S) To W. Ke.nda.1, Esq.
MY DEAB BANCROFT,
You are engaged in playing Tom Jervoise, pronounced
"Jervis," as you are probably aware by this time, and so will have
been unable to visit the Princess's (unless you can spare time to
patronise a benefit, as I see you kindly did on the occasion of Miss
SOLDKXE'S Matinee), to see the new play Claiidian, with plot by
Mr. HERMAN, dialogue by Mr. WILLS, and Acting by Mr. WILSOS
BARRETT, so that Clauclian may be described as a "WILLS-AN'
BARRETT" Drama.
Well, my dear BANCROFT, CMudian is not much in. your line,
and when I have told you that there is a dramatic prologue
capitally stage-managed, a beautiful scene, and a striking denoument,
and when I have added that after this the audience is doomed to dis-
appointment, as there is nothing much to follow, that the scenery,
though good, is not such as nowadays calls for extravagant lauda-
tion, not being within measurable distance of the great Temple
Scene in The Cup, at the Lyceum, that the plot is uninteresting, and

Claudian the Wills-an' Barrett Masher (A.D. 362) and Ma Mashed Victims;
or, Harlequin Beautiful for Ever and the Curse-ory Clement.
that Mr. BAERETT appears to have much more to do in the way of
declamation and paying careful attention to himself in classic atti-
tudes than in genuine acting, I have said all that can be said
about the piece, except that the dialogue may he, and possibly
is admirable; yet after hearing it twice, I could not undertake
to swear whether it is written in the most classic prose, or the
blankest verse. All I know, is that the Tetrarch, who is a sort of
comic IRVING, is twice likened to a toad, that Mr. WILLS-AN'
BAREETT'S " heart goes out to " the young person who is so blindly
devoted to him; that, though thoroughly aware that "when he comes
amongst them their sunshine is obscured," and that he brings sorrow
on all to whom he shows kindness, he yet will persist in meddling
in other people's affairs, muddling them sadly, and actually stopping
people, who are utter strangers to him, in the public thoroughfare, to
inquire into their business, which he knows perfectly well is no sort
of concern of his. In the last Act, the absurd sesthetic love-sick
maiden, who has obtained Mr. WILSON BABBITT'S permission to call
him "Master," describes the Master's great love in terms which,
being too suggestive of beautiful scriptural imagery, rather jar upon
the ear of a not over-fastidious spectator.
Why did not Mr. WILSON BARRETT let Poet WILLS write the words
of the incidental ballads? They were in his way, surely, more than
in that of the Plottist HERMAN? Why have a Poet oa the estab-
lishment and not use him, eh, my dear BANCROFT? I have
fld^eubt that, in consequence of the gush and guggle of some of the
Critics, but specially of the Eminent Hand on the Titnet, the
Public will patronise this entertainment up to a certain point. But
I do not think it is in for any extraordinary share of popularity, nor
is it my opinion that Mr. HENRY IRVING and Miss ELLEN TERRY
need tremble for their position. It will want a bigger Earth-
quake than that at the Princess's to shake the footing that HENRY
and ELLEN have got with the Public. Of course, you with^your light
or heavy comedy, as the case may be, are "out of it," and can afford
to watcn the struggles of tragedians with a smile.
A propos of HENRY and ELLEN, when is the latter going to be
Marguerite, and the former Mephitstopheles i Don't you think that

Poet WILLS might do them a version of the French play that CHABLES
KEAN made so popular? That's the best one for dramatic purposes.
If, my dear BANCROFT, you happen to be writing to either HENRY
or ELLEN, suggest this query — unless you're thinking of doing
Mephislopheles yourself—and if so, with Mrs. BEERE as Marguerite,
eh! But this is to inquire, as WILLS-AN' BARRETT does, as dattdian,
into other people's business, which does not concern your old friend,
NIBBS.
To J. L. TooU, Esq.
MY DEAH PROFESSOR OF RESERVED FORCE,
You asked'me on your return to town and settling down in
London for Christmas—(most of us in London for Christmas have to
"settle up"}—to give you some account of The Rocket—your friend
PINERO'S new piece at the
Gaiety — where once you
begged the audience to
excuse your glove, and
executed your inimitable
step, which I should have
thought was patented and
duly protected had I not
seen it actually performed
by a young lady dancer
in Mr. WILLS-AN' BAR-
RETT'S Byzantine Palace
at the Princess's. "By
permission of J. L. TOOLE"
was not expressly stated i,
in the programmes, but no j
doubt you have some pri- *
vate arrangement. I will ;.
tell you about The Rocket
perhaps next week, but rinero tlie H"jfcn at the Gaiety;
won't detain you now or, "Eock-it, Terry, Rock-it!"
[except to say that TERRY
is very funny in it], as I know you are busy in getting up several
classic dramas and arranging your lectures for the ensuing term at
Oxford. Yours truly, NIBBS.
To W. Kcndal, Esq.
MY DEAE KENDAI,,
I HAVE so much to tell you about Pygmalion and Galatea
that I must leave the description till I have more time at disposal.
Oh, you would enjoy
it, I 'm sure. Mr. BABNES
does your part, you know;
and I rather fancy Mr. W.
S. GLLBEBT—(he wrote this
piece, you may recollect)—
took him in hand at re-
hearsal, and toned him
down a bit. Excellent
Mr. BABNES ! — ordinarily
rather more of the Barnes
Common than you or I
could wish,—but this time
it's all Greek to him,—I
mean he's a thorough
Greek, and there's not
even a touch of Putney
about him. The effect is
excellent when an Author
knows how to rehearse his
own pieces, and can get
intelligent Artists to act
upon nis hints. But of
this, as SHAXSPEARE says,
"Anon." I mustn't for-
get to tell you all about the
Young Folks' Ways, Missy
ANDERSON, and the rest of
the Company. You will be enchanted to hear that the House was
crammed, and that I could only get a seat right up in the corner—
or, rather, wrong up in the corner. All theatres must be doing
uncommonly well, as yours will be the only one, I hear, where within
a few days there will even be A Scrap of " Paper " visible.

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
'"EXCELSIOR" AT THE ROYAL COURTS.
(A Ftrensic Tragedy in Three Parts.)
PAST I.—IN THE CORRIDOB!
"I WILL take to the Law," cried the Young Enthusiast, glowing
with excitement. "It is my ambition to scale the Woolsack itself!"
"Stay!" replied the Sage, with a shudder. "You do not know
what a trial lies before you.
"You mean hard reading—cramming—examinations."
The Old Man smiled derisively.
"You do not understand the situation," he murmured, after a
pause. "Anyone with average ability and severe study can master
enough law to be called. But I fear for your body—it will have to
endure the many severe tests awaiting it in the Law Courts."
"I am hardy. My muscles are of iron."
"Yes, yes." interrupted the Sage, "But are you a member of the
Alpine Club? Have you ascended the loftiest peaks of the Hima-
lavas? Can you climb? Can you see in the dark?"
The Young Enthusiast assured the Sage that he was most anxious
to qualify. Then for years he ascended the loftiest peaks of the
Himalayas, and for years dwelt in a prison in total darkness.
The Sage, pleased at the lad's earnestness, told him, on his return,
that he might now pay his first visit to the Law Courts.
Nothing loth, the would-be Judge hurried to the Strand, and plunged
wildly into a corridor. It was as dark as Tartarus. He crawled
along, now tumbling down a staircase, now ascending unexpected
steps. Anon he passed a dimly-lighted room, in which shivering
Jurymen were vainly attempting to read documents. Now he came
to a gloomy dungeon, barred and vaulted, in which he supposed,
from the fragrance of cooked meats, that it was intended that
luncheon should be discussed. Dazed, bruised, and disheartened, he
returned once more, threading his way through the black passages,
and travelling up and down the seoret.stairs until he found himself
again in the entrance-hall.
"And you are still anxious to go to the Bar?" asked the Sage.
The reply was in the affirmative. Five years later the Young
Enthusiast was called, and bought his wig and gown.
PART II.—AT THE BAB!!
"You intend to practise?" asked the Sage.
"I do," replied the Gentleman of the Long Robe, who was nearing
middle-age. "I know what I shall have to do. I quite understand
that I must read with a good Junior, perhaps even enter a Solicitor's
office to learn the details of practice"
"Stop, stop!" interrupted the Sage. "Once more you are merely
concerning yourself with trifles, idle details, when you should be
giving the whole of your attention to the condition of your body.
You must prepare your frame to endure the trying heat of the
Courts. A journey in the Soudan should be undertaken at once."
The forensic Telemachus accepted the advice of his Mentor, and
spent many, many years in the Desert.
At length he returned, and entered the Royal Courts once again.
It was now his duty to seat himself in a kind of pew, into which hot
air the reverse of fresh was continually being pumped up with
fearful force. He was almost baked.
Still he persevered, and, surviving all his fellows, was made a Judge.
PABT III.—Os THE BENCH!!!
"You have done right to ask for leave of absence for three years,"
said the Sage.
"Yes," replied the newly-elected le^al dignitary, "I wish to rub
up mv Authorities. In my present position I shouldn't be——"
"Nay. nay," interrupted the old man, placing his hand kindly on
his Lordship's shoulder, "you can leave your law to take care of
itself. It must be your duty now to visit the North Pole. You will
never be able to keep on the Bench unless you can brave an Arctic
winter—unless you have braved several Arctic winters."
The now elderly lawyer bowed acquiescence. His Lordship imme-
diately set sail for Greenland, and soon was the discoverer of the
lowest temperature on the face of the earth.
It was a wonderful sight to see the Enthusiast on his return braving
the elements in his own Division. The bitterly cold air was forced by
pumps from morning until night upon the devoted head of the pre-
siding Judge. The gusts came rushing over the seats and desks of
the Bar until diverted by the Jury-Box they found a safe and well-
curtained goal in his Lordship's own chair!
One day the Sage was blown on to the Bench by one of these
withering blasts. He approached the Enthusiast, and spoke to him.
"You have done well. It was I who told you that the hardiness
of your body was of f ar greater importance than the storing of your
mind, to succeed at the Bar and on the Bench. You have taken m;
advioe in good part, and now I come to tell yon that you are appoints
Lord Chancellor of England! Let me congratulate you!"
The Sage held/mt his hand, but there was no response. The En-
thusiast, in spite of his training, had—been frozen to death.'
NOT BEFORE IT IS WANTED;
OR, A PROMISING PROSPECTUS.
THE ROYAL AND IMPERIAL HOMELESS AITD WANDERING "VISITORS
HOTEL COMPANY (LIMITED).
THE Directors of this unique and magnificently conceived enter-
prise, undertaken with a view to supplying that now long experi-
;nced National want, a suitable palatial residence for Princes and
Potentates found wandering in search of a fitting domicile about
the back streets of the Metropolis, have much pleasure in informing
their intended august Patrons, that their perfectly-appointed estab-
lishment will shortly open under the direction of a well-known and
experienced retired Central-European Monarch, whose distinguished
services they have had the honour to secure.
The following (extracted from the Company's Abridged Prospectus)
comprise a few of the leading features of the new establishment:—
The building will stand on a convenient and imposing site judici-
ously selected in the immediate vicinity of the Metropolitan
District Railway Station, St. James's Park, and within easy
access of the Aquarium, Westminster Bridge, the House of
Detention, and the Foreign Office.
There will be no lettered name or title on the facade of the new
Hotel, which will, with the object of giving rise to a pleasing
illusion, be specially designed by the architect to resemble as
far as possible that of a not far distant neighbouring and gener-
ally unoccupied Royal Palace.
A trained and certificated Diplomatist, who can speak several Euro-
pean languages fluently, will be permanently attached to the
staff of the establishment, and give his services gratis.
A couple of effective Sentry Boxes will also be placed at the principal
entrance, and occupied permanently by two of the Company's
Private Soldiers, wno, dressed in the correct uniform of HEB
MAJESTY'S Foot Guards, will be efficiently drilled for their
Gold Sticks in Waiting will attend in the Hall for the purpose of
receiving Royal and Imperial Visitors. They mil also, if desired
to do so, precede them to their respective apartments, walking
backwards up-stairs for a small extra charge.
The general scheme of the establishment will include several public
Throne and Reading Rooms, a Privy Council Chamber, Gala
Banquet Hall, and a series of excellent Billiard and Abdication
Tables by the best makers.
In order to meet the requirements of august personages who desire
to be surrounded at a reasonable cost with such State accessories as
are proper to their dignity and position, the subjoined Tariff of Prices
has been carefully arranged by the Management, in the hope that it
will be found not incompatible with a charge on the most moderate
civil list:—
TARIFF.
Private Royal or Imperial Sitting-Room (per day) . . 6s. to Is. 6d.
(Ditto, ditto, with throne, 2s. 6d. extra.)
Ditto Bed-Room (exclusive of light) 3«. to 6s.

Provincial Mayors and other distinguished individuals expressing
their readiness to honour the Company's Royal and Imperial
Patrons by their notice. Parties also made up and personally con-
ducted to visit State Apartments of Royal Palaces (when open to the
Public), or to inspect and explain waxwork effigies of Royal Family
at Madame TUSSAUD'S Exhibition.

Only a face of brass and lips unfaltering1.
Thus EELN'S champions play their patriot part,
Closing o'er murder and with treason paltering.

A myriad dupes may proffer. Seems their guerdon
Not taint with blood? Does conscience never tire
Of patent sophistry's perpetual burden?
A thing of beauty! Sycorax's son
Hose-wreathed and lily-garlanded! Delightful!
Sweet innocent, so full of gentle fun,
Not savage, never murderous, scarcely spiteful!
Scowling—he sometimes scowls—in pretty play,
Maiming—when maim he must—with purest motive,
Slaying—for sometimes he's constrained to slay—
In spqrtfulness, or as an offering votive
At Patriotism's altar. Taint of crime
He knows not any more than touch of passion,
A gentle ghoul of patience quite sublime,
Blameless as beautiful, and quite the fashion!
Crown him with wreath Arcadian, set the crook,
Within his clutch. Great Heaven! it sounds sardonic!
In memory of the past 'tis hard to brook
Closings that seem so hideously ironic.
Go to, cold Sophister! Those murderous knives
Gleam still before us; we hold recollection
Of your ghoul's holocaust of blameless lives,
Rose-wreaths hide not the awful retrospection.
Crown Caliban with lilies, if you like,
And hail the ruthless monster as a brother.
Gold for good words! That bargain you may strike,
And truly, "one good turn deserves another."
But think not chill effrontery will deceive
True hearts or History. Casuist cold and sinister,
Spite of all word-adornments you may weave.

SIX YEARS IN A HOUSE-BOAT.
"Six ears in a House-Boat"? Rather six eyes and six hands, or
sixty eyes and sixty hands, in a House-Boat, judging from the
amount seen and chronicled for the benefit of lovers of the Thames.
If you doubt what we say, go to the Old Bond Street Galleries, and
judge for yourselves. There in the depth of winter you may take
the cheapest possible trip up the Thames, and linger as long as you
like amid its choicest scenery. Why, by the way, does the accom-
plished Artist call himself KEELEY HAISWEIXE. when he avowedly
spent such a long time in a boat without a Keel { This is probably
his little joke. No matter. "Halswelle that ends well;" and very
few Thames trips have ended so well as the one that everyone can
now enjoy at their leisure in Bond Street.

THE SECRET OF DEADMAN'S; iTERRACE.
(A Sanitary Christmas Story.)

ClTAPTEB I.
Y five Uncles ! ^'1 shall never
know what made me do it. hut
I determined to get rid of them.
Yes; there were five of them!
They had taken respectively,
but without much success, to the
Army, the Navy, the Church,
the Bar, and the Medical Pro-
fession, and were. Heaven hless
them! so much alike, that, but
for the outward garb of their
respective calling, I could
scarcely have distinguished one
from the other.
> I recall them now, as they
stand before me in a row,—five
dear, hale, hearty, good-temper-
ed, and singularly confiding old
bachelors as you could wish to
see. They had never done me
any wrong. True,-^on the occa-
sion of my christening they had,
between them, given me a plated
fork, knife, and spoon of an
inferior quality; but, as years
lad rolled on, I had forgotten,—indeed, I had almost forgiven this.
What was it then? Impulse? Perhaps. Or was it that they
stood remotely between me and the enjoyment of £6 13s. per annum?
Again — perhaps? But who can tell? Enough that something
seemed to say to me, "Before the first of January next your
Uncles must disappear."
Christmas was near at hand, and I quickly decided on my course.
[ had recently been reading in a penny illustrated paper an admirably
written life of one of the elder Borgias. It fascinated me on this
floomy December evening, and I resolved on action. Scarcely con-
scions of what I did, I walked to the nearest Chemist, and asked
mechanically for a pound-and-a-half of the best arsenic.
There was a faint glimmer in the shop, and the proprietor eyed
me curiously. Then he got out a large pair of scales.
"You require this for rats, I presume?" he asked, smiling by
mere force of habit, as he shovelled about the deadly drug.
I started for an instant, but I soon collected myself.
"Yes—for rats," I rejoined quietly; "I have five coming to dine
with me on Christmas Day."
I was thinking of my Uncles, and spoke absently,—but my inter-

rogator paused. Something I had said.'had evidently interested hi™.
He stole softly round the counter, and led me to the door.
We were standing
in the thickening fog
now, and he had
taken me kindly by
the hand.
"There be land
rats and family
rats," he said, quot-
ing SHAKSPEABE, in
a sweet husky voice,
"and you doubtless
would get rid of
them. But you are
young, ah! too, too
young for a Coro-
ner's inquest; and
arsenic is but poor
stuff nowadays.
Take the advice of
an old man who, in
his time, has not
been unfamiliar
with the working
of the local Burial
Club. Try something surer."
"But what ?" I gasped, my bright little Christmas fancy seeming
to fade, as I spoke, in the stifling winter gloom.
He laughed bitterly. "You ask tchat," he echoed, "when the
water company, the milkman, the tinned provision merchant, and.
deadliest of all, the modern builder, conspire to defraud the poor old
toiling but honest dispenser of simple poisons of his hard-earned
pittance? Ha! ha! ha! you are indeed young!" Then the door closed,
—but not till three hoarsely-whispered words had reached my ear.
The words were these:—" Try Deadman's Terrace."
CHAPTER II.
I lost no time. At nine o'clock the next morning I had seen the
Agent. At ten I had taken No. 13, Deadman's Terrace, on a three
years' agreement. My furniture went in the same afternoon, and
by the evening's country post I despatched the five letters of invita-
tion to my five Uncles.
Was I mad? No. Was I sanguine? Yes. For everything
promised success. I noticed that there was straw laid down the
road as far as the eye could reach either way,—that there was a
hatchment, too, on every other house. My spirits rose.

A PRACTICAL VIEW.
First Parishioner (to recently-appointed Mini&ter). "VERRA OLED TO FALL IN wi' YE, SIR, AN' MAK.' YER ACQUA'NTANCE! I HINNA
BEEN AT THE KlRK SYNE YE CAM', AS I WIS IN RoSS-SHIItE."

o' THE PARISH, YER VISITIN' THE SICK, AN' WHA CARES FOR PREACHIN'!"
'O.But let me recall the situation. First, the house—my house, the
one I had taken. It comes back to me now as in the first moment I
entered it. I can almost feel the icy chill that struck into my very
marrow from the dripping dampness of the walls; the staggering
f aintness with'which I mounted to the drawing-room floor, overcome
hy the appalling odour that pervaded
every nook and corner of the premises.
My Solicitor was with me at the time.
I can see him, in that far past dis-
tinctly, reeling backwards in a fit,
and borne away delirious, never to
recover, to the nearest hospital.
Other pleasing recollections flit
through my brain. There is the care-
taker, pallid, but supported against
the death-dealing miasma of the base-
ment by gin and habit. I can hear her
voice as she gives me grim details of my
own and the surrounding property.
"Where all this here terrace stands,
they do say. Sir, was a fever-swamp
as had all the rubbage of the neigh-
bourhood throwed into it for years,
and there wasn't a house of the whole
seventy-two of 'em that nse'n't to
have three funerals a quarter when
they first started. Some says there's something wrong with the
'ouses still, but, bless you, I don't believe it; for they was, the whole
lot of 'em, run up in three months—nice green wood put into 'em,
too,—and it can't be drains,—as, for matter o' that, none of them, to
my certain knowledge, 'as got any at all."
It was New Year's Eve, and I was moved by the generous spirit of
the hour. I remember giving the good soul half-a-crown, and going to
my study in a state of pleasant, feverish, but hopeful excitement. The
hour was near. I had not long to wait. Presently came a loud ring at

the bell, then another, quickly followed by three more. My Uncles were
here at last! In a few minutes the whole five of them had arrived.
"Well, JACK, my boy," they all said, in turn, in their honest,
cheery manner as I showed them to their respective rooms, "yon
seem to have a rare snug berth of a house here. I mean to enjoy
myself, for I never felt so well in my life!"
As I shut them into their various mephitic but cosily furnished
cells, with their cans of hot water to dress for dinner, I smiled
quietly. Then taking a dose of fever mixture myself, as a mere
precaution, I awaited them on the drawing-room rug. They came
down at length, and I saw at a glance that the advice of my good kind
old friend, the criminal chemist, had been sound. As they entered
the room, I noticed the marvellous effect that even this short stay
under my roof had already produced on them. Their hale look was
gone. On the announcement of dinner they staggered rather than
walked to the door. I had taken the arm of my military Uncle.
"You are not well ?" I said, carelessly.
"Nothing, my boy," was his prompt, soldierlike reply; "but the

room seems whirling, and—hang it!—I 've not felt this sort of sen-
sation in my head since I was blown up in the magazine at Fuzzypore."
It was clear that Deadman's Terrace had begun its work.'

dents, "you called Mr.

KOMER, R.A. First, he
isn't'HERBERT' but' Hu-
BEKT'; and, secondly, he

wasn't it a Fancy Portrait?

is not all our fancy painted
him, why grumble? If he
doesn't f' fancy himself "—
rather—as R.A., well, v>e
did, and we wish he may
get it,—as no doubt he will.
What's the good of a fancy
portrait if it is to be a
plain matter-of-fact resem-
blance? Why, it might as
well be like its original at
once, and we all know from
the sworn evidence of the
Royal Academical Experts
that the merit of mere like-
ness does not give a portrait
its artistic value. "Go to!

ON THE NEW UNDERGROUND.
GIVE me a ticket, please, which will enable me to get out at the
Reformers' Oak in Hyde Park.
Do we really travel underneath the Serpentine? How fortunate
that I provided myself with a waterproof before starting.
I suppose that it is because the line passes somewhere near Buck-
ingham Palace that the explosion occurred last evening which
knocked out all mv front teeth and spoilt a new pair of trousers.
Is it true that all the omnibus conductors between Westminster,
Charing Cross, and Regent Circus, have joined the Invincible Organi-
sation, owing to being thrown out of employment by the competition
of the new line?
As no ventilators of anv kind whatever are allowed on this railway,
perhaps the Company will provide suitable mortuaries at Edgeware
Road and Westminster Stations for the reception of asphyxiated
passengers.
Did you say that the sound of Ministers, engaged in heated argu-
ment, could be distinctly heard when the train comes to a standstill
under Downing Street?
No, because since the cask of dynamite was discovered hidden in
the funnel of an engine worked by a Fenian driver, all traffic has
been suspended on the days when Cabinet Councils are held.
Dear me! Who was it—Mr. HOWARD VINCENT, I fancy—who
said that London was the safest capital in Europe?
How pleasant, after all, it is to know that all the little ragamuffins
from Chapel Street, Edgeware Road, are now able to take tickets
to Birdcage Walk Station, and play about the Mall all day, after
assisting at the Trooping of the Colours in the morning!
Oh, Guard! I am afraid I must really have taken the wrong
train, as I have booked for Hammersmith, and yet here I am at
midnight landed, in a dense fog, on a damp grass-plot, in the very
middle of the Green Park!
"WHEN FOUND," &c.—The Times Reviewer, in his second notice
of the Life of Lord Lytton, says of him in his early working days,
when making £500 a-year and spending £3000, " Almost an unknown
man, and generally detested by the Critics, he had to meet the deficit
by indefatigable toil." We draw attention to the words which we
have placed in italics for the information of those who follow without
inquiry the opinions of self-constituted professional leaders of public
taste. "Pelham brought him into fame, though the manuscript had
been rejected by the publisher's reader." An old story; but on the
other hand, to now many would-be Authors has rejection by the pub-
lisher's reader been a boon? The Reader—the one solitary reader
whom these mute inglorious Thackerays and Dickenses, these nipped-
in-the-bud novelists, have had—is a public benefactor. We doubt
if we should have heard of Mr. ANSTEY GDTHRIE'S, or GUTHBIB
ANSTEY'S, Vice Versa, but for a very judicious and discriminating
Reader. But that any Author, once started, should have to fight
against the " general detestation of critics," says much for the suc-
cessful Author, and much against the Critics.
MRS. RAMSBOTHAM tells us her youngest Nephew has just become
a Midshipman in the Royal Navy, and she has given him one of the
best Aromatic Telescopes that could be bought for money.

CANTO V.—DBESS.
DRESS! Spheric word with cyclic meaning fraught!
Whole universe of fancy, passion, thought,

Closed in five letters! What, of all that moves
The female breast, from teas to tragic loves,
Moves it so solely, with such conquering stress,
As to crowd out emotions born of Dress?
PUNCHTUS, his task the course of love to trace,
Perchance should have apportioned the first place-
Not the Fifth Canto—and his freshest fire,
To the soul-searching subject of Attire!
Woman's infirmity, alone supreme
And self-sufficing, boundary of all dream,
And all desire, circuit beyond whose scope
Flies fancy never, never flutters hope.
Love seems its mere dependent. \ et the tie
'Twixt them is close and strong. To lure Love's eye
Vestureless Venus vaunts a lesser charm
Than she whom " Form" and Fashion jointly arm
For wider conquest. Young VANESSA knows
The power of Form" as well as she who rose
Fair from the Paphian foam-wreaths, "Form" displayed
Not less bewitchinglv because arrayed
Bv Fashion, not by Neptune. It were odd
If deftest skill of the old briny god,
With snowy spray and sea-wrack only aided,
Revealed so deftly, so discreetly shaded,
As the joint wisdom and united skill
Of Modistes and Mammas, equipped at will
With all that Mode and Mammon furnish forth,
The wealth of Babylon, the wit of WOKTH,
The typic fig-leaf aptly to adjust
To varying exigence of zone and bust.
VANESSA, matron-coached, has an idea
That she could give long odds to Cytherea
In roseate revealings, and romp in
An easy winner. How to best begin, _
How most adroitly finish—problem this
Young jockeys and coy ingenues may miss,
Not ABCHEB or VANESSA.
But a pout
Wreathes with the shadow of a wistful doubt
Those soft, uncalculating, free-arched lips,
Not yet in love with scorn or cynic quips.
Well, willow-waisted GRACE, your dainty guise
Is innocently aimed at manly eyes!
Aha! You blush, bending the briar-spray down
O'er the white forehead which affects to frown.
Why not? 'Tis seldom men sincerely scorn
The Art whose aim is Nature to adorn
In Nature's highest shape. Though Satire gird
With pen or pencil at a made absurd.
Satire would feel the funniest of shocks
Should Satire's wife abjure the mode he mocks,
And earn the dreaded name of Dowdy! Clime
Compels convention. Ours no golden prime
Of life Arcadian. To the critic eye
All human vesture seems absurdity,
Most comic of necessities. But men
Are not all TEUTTXSDHOCKHS. Attack them then
With arms Le Pallet fashions to your nse.
Culture the code of Fashion may abuse
But not abolish. Dress is the supreme
Philistinism of our sphere; no dream
Of rational revolution or revolt.
No wit-winged flight of Ridicule's'swif t bolt,
Can move our soft assailants. Dullard man
Abides the siege, but fathoms not the plan.
The witchery of fine folds and artful dyes
He 'U credit, clever CLELIA, to your eyes;
The tasteful cincture of the trim-laced zone,
'Lithe Lucr, is a charm he '11 deem your own;
The swell and sweep of drapery ordered well
He '11 blend with you, majestic ISABEL;
The snowy girth of taper wrist and throat,
The lace that flutters, and the plumes that float,
0 dainty GRACE, he '11 think seraphic things,
Inseparable from you as gowns and wings
From the ideal angels of our songs.
"Form's" fitting vesture to the soul belongs,
In common apprehension. Who so keen
As to appraise the spell of glow and sheen
Apart from silk-clad sorceress, siren trim,
Whose every contour soft and slender limb
Radiates robe-charmed brightness? Cupid knows
The witcherv of tense glove and tasteful nose.
Hear what the genial god confides to Punch,
O'er " Boy" ana bivalves, at a Fleet Street lunch!
CUPID.
"Beauty when unadorned adorned the most "!
Oh, prettiest of Parnassian commonplaces!
The tri-forked Mount, for all its valiant boast
Of free ideals and unfettered graces,
Is as convention-bound—in most things—still,
As Primrose Hill.
Puginalion to-day might compromise
With vesture ere he vitalised his statue.
Picture pure Galatea's gentle eyes
Arch o'er a Mayfair fan-arch beaming at you!
No Cyprian studio yours for sculpture Phidian,
Or song Ovidian!
Is?Art a grey Tithonus lagging slow
After the flying footsteps of the Morning?
So twitterers tell us. But the roseate glow
Of clouds, the pomp of flowers make sweet "adorning,"
Which scarcely mars the beauty of Aurora,
The charm of Flora.
Beauty in beauty robed, though less'divine
Than in pure self-sufficingness. best fitteth
Our less than Golden Age. The hyaline.
O'er which storm-wrack or snow-cloud never flitteth,
May canopy the robe-unaided Charis
The free-limbed Paris;
But could the charm-appraising shepherd-boy
Judge at a modern Beauty-Show, ne 'd grapple
With the idea of " Dress as a Decoy,"
And, I will wager, not withhold the apple
Because La Mode arrays your Mayfair goddesses
In ball-room bodices!
So Cupid, sweetings, on the mightv theme.
What subtler sense through his soft praise may gleam
'Tis yours to measure. That the Paphian fire
Is quickened and not quenched by deft attire
He owneth.
Yet be wise; cross not the gods
By inharmonious freaks with Taste at odds.
A tint flamboyant, or a dowdy turn
Of skirt or scarf, may dim the lights that burn
In eyes late worshipping; a tender twist
Of tendril hair, a curve of slender wrist,
Lace-^irt or golden-circled, may avail
To re-illumine flames that faint or fail.
Fitness, not fashion, is the conquering lure,
Eros to win and suitors to secure.
But there's a subtler art—oh, study this!—
'Tis blending both in one fine synthesis!
Fitness on fashion moulds, and fashion bends
To the behests of fitness to such ends
As sublimate Le Fullet into charm,
Making of Beauty's bonds a keener arm,
And half redeem us from the stern dureste
Of that opprobrium of the Human—Dress!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
THE SPEAKER.
(A Handbook to Ready-made Oratory.)
PART IX.—LITERATURE AND JOURNALISM.
IN the days gone by, at the fag-end of a toast-list at a Farmer's
Dinner, "the Gentlemen of the Press" used to be given with a
brevity attributable to the Chairman's exhaustion. That exhaustion
had been caused by numberless " healths" of far greater importance
than the welfare of those claiming to be Members of the Fourth
Estate. The acknowledgment was usually entrusted to a lad of
eighteen or thereabouts, who addressed, in impassioned accents, an
audience of wine-weary sleepers. But nowadays all this is changed,
and " The Press," when it figures either in a proposal or a response,
nearly invariably is provocative of the highest nights of eloquence.
And until recently, this special recognition of Journalism was the
only acknowledgment, from a toast-master's point of view, that
such a thing as Literature was in existence. Again nowadays this
is changed, and " the Pen" is nearly as popular after dinner as "the
Sword."
However, when all is said and done, the toast is new, and conse-
quently it may be as well to jot down a few suggestions calculated
to assist the proposer of " Literature " in acquitting himself credit-
ably. Here follows then—
FACTS TO BE REMEMBERED BY THE CHAMPIONS OF THE PEN.
1. That the QUEEN has published Stray Leaves from a Diary.
2. That Lord WOLSELET wrote The Soldier's Pocket-book.
3. That Lords MACAULAY and LTTTON both scribbled a little.
4. That the Earl of BEACONSFIELD got £1,000 (more or leas) for
Endymion.
5. That the Author of Locksley Hall, and other Poems, is about
to be made a Peer.
6. And, lastly, above all and before all, that Literature pays, now-
adays, nearly as well as cheesemongering.
This, of course, is taking a very material view of the subject.
There is an alternative tone that can be adopted, the more especially
that recently the tone in question has become very fashionable. The
prevailing idea by those who accept this last view of the subject is
that there is a hidden meaning in everything, which is either beneath
or above comprehension. Thus there is something grandly sugges-
tive about a gridiron. The fact that the homely article is used for
cooking mutton-chops or beef-steaks is a mere uninteresting detail—
it must be regarded as a peer to a sunset or a snow-covered moun-
tain. Again, li a Theatrical Manager produces a successful play, and
in consequence is able to announce on placards that "the Stalls are
full," and that there is "only standing-room in the Pit," the mere
commercial value of the venture must be ignored the while the enter-
prising entrepreneur is lauded to the skies for his " love of the beau-
tiful,'^ and his "deep earnest feeling for the welfare 9f Art." To
make this plainer, it will be as well to give an illustration. And, as
the subject is very often connected with the Drama, a dramatic form
is the most convenient in which that illustration can be presented.
To work, then:—
SCENE—A Banquet. TIME— When the sweets of the confectioner
hare given place to the sugar of the after-dinner orator. The
tenth toast on the list has been proposed, honoured, and receired
a response. A young old man, with an effeminate air and a
silk shirt-front, rises to introduce "No. 11" to the garrulous
revellers. He wears a pince-nez, and speaks with the soupqon of
a lisp. He is received tcith considerable applause on being recog-
nised as Mr. ROSETTI TWADDLE, the eminent Critic.
Mr. Rosetti Twaddle (deferential/!/'). Your Royal Highness—
(graciously)—my Lords and—(abruptly)—Gentlemen. I have under-
taken a somewhat difficult task this evening. But I do not dread
the responsibility, as every task must be difficult if performed in an
entirely earnest spirit. (" Hear, hear.'") I wish to be entirely and
wholly in earnest, for I take it that the highest aims of the man of
culture are as the half-forgotten whispering of the Autumn leaves,
unless approached with all the rugged force of an equatorial whirl-
pool. (Applause.) All things that are wholly true must he of
necessity completely lovable. ("Hear, hear.'") And as this
is indeed the case, pens, ink, and paper, when the means of
suggesting noble thoughts at once assume the exquisite grandeur of
all that is most true, and consequently most admirable, in Nature,
which is another name for Art. (Loud cheers.) The soldier of the
pen should be inspired by a subtle influence, and it is this subtle
influence—so strange in its ramifications, so wholly comforting in
its suggestions—that I ask you to toast even as our ancestors crushed
cups in their armour to the fairest ladies of their knightly choice.
("Hear, hear!") For, indeed, this subtle influence is a beautiful
mistress—pure as a lily, as grand as an earthquake. (Cheers.) It
was this gentle mistress that inspired HOMER, CHAUCER, or, to come
to modern times, Master WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE. (" Hear, hear! )
And it is this subtle influence, this gentle, this beautiful mistress,
who has inspired our dear friend TOMPKINS BROWN, the lessee of the
Theatre Royal Parthenon. (Prolonged cheering.) I am glad
you agree with me, for I take this consent as a sign of your entirely
perfect intelligence. (Renewed applause.] It happened that I was
at the theatre of our respected friend—respected, because he is the
High Priest of Art—(cheers)—onlv a few nights ago. I had been in
his private room, and had been discussing a poor play of my own.
(" No, no.'") Yes, poor, because it contained but a few thousand
lines of indifferent verse. (" No, no ! ") You are completely kind!
(Cheers). And when we had come to the only right, the only pos-
sible conclusion, that mere Money was not to be weighed for an
instant in the scales with Art—(" hear, hear.'")—and the considera-
tion of the date for the production of my little fancy had been tem-
porarily postponed, TOMPKINS BROWN invited me to "come in
front" to see nis latest contribution to the civilisation of the nine-
teenth century. (Cheers.) I obeyed, and never shall 1 forget what
I then saw. I was in fairyland.' There were scores of beau-
tiful figures draped in gold and silver tissue floating through
an atmosphere or the most delicately tinted gems. But I did
not look at the scene. My attention was riveted on the chief
Actor, who, wearing a white tunic with red spots, and a peculiar
head-dress (handed down to us from medifeval times) with three
thin upright plumes, was gazing at the wholly beautiful beings
revolving around him, with intense earnestness. The face of the
chief Actor was an epic. (Cheers.) His soul shone through
the white paint on his nose, the red triangular spots on his
cheeks and forehead. (Cheers.) His look of mingled wonder
and admiration brought the tears to my eyes. (" Hear, hear.'") A
smile of marvellous simplicity spread over his prominent eyes, his
artificially-widened mouth, like the shadow of a summer-cloud
sailing over a corn-field. There was an exquisite pathos in his
wonder, an infinite tenderness in his admiration. (Cheers.) That
smile recalled Swiss cataracts, Italian ruins, the glories of Rome, the
broken marbles of ancient Greece. (Renewed applause.) I mur-
mured, "Enter boldly, for here, too; there are Gods!" (Frantic
cheering.) I felt that I was watching a great Actor. (" Hear,
hear.' ) Then he turned round, and, with admirable earnestness,
knocked down the scoffing figure of his companion, an ancient Pan-
taloon. (Cheers.) That blow was a revelation. In it I traced a
career wholly devoted to Art. (Renewed applause.) And what
caused me to see so much? I will tell you. It was that subtle
influence to which I have alluded—that subtle influence which guides
the pen of the wholly honest critic, which opens the eyes of culture,
and is'yet as nought to the yokel and the Philistine. This subtle
influence is the life of literature, the soul of criticism. And this
subtle influence is what I ask you to toast. It is the life-blood of
the pen and the bone, tissues and nerves of the pencil. ("Hear,
hear.'") I give you, then, from the very bottom of my heart, and
with entire confidence in its reception, the revelation of to-day and
the great master of to-morrow. In a word, I give you Gush.'
[Enormous enthusiasm, during which the speaker resumes his seat.
So much for the proposal. As for the reply, it is useless to give it.
If inspired by the proper] spirit, it would be wholly and entirely—
unintelligible.
HAIO-ZACTLT So!—In the very useless dispute between Mr.
CHARLES HAIO, wine-merchant, and the Rev. DAWSON BURNS, D.D.,
as to Liquor Trade and Christianity, it certainly seems to us that
the wine-merchant has six-to-four the best of it iu argument.
Among other things, he said that the " sobriety of the Jews was not
due to their religious regulations nor to their exclusiveness ;" and
he stated that at Passover-time, publicans in the East-end of London
"put up a Hebrew word in their windows signifying that they have
on tap a particular puncheon of rum which has been passed by the
Rabbi." Now this is a bit indefinite. Had the worthy Rabbi
"passed the puncheon" as he would among convives have "passed
the bottle," or had he neglected it and passed over it, or passed by it,
examined it and then, because it "answered," given it a pass t
The last, we suppose, is the correct version. We were not aware that
there were Jew publicans; but, being reminded of the ancient riddle
which might have had its origin in Palestine, it is evidently quite in
the fitness of things that the publicans should be one of the He-brews.
The idea of anyone of the name of Burns going in for total absti-
nence! Well, well, Time brings its revenges. But, assuredly, the
Rev. Dr. DAWSON BURNS would have been disavowed by the "rantin'
roarin' boy" of that ilk were he still in the "land of cakes" and
ale, while as to Mr. HAIQ, the sound of his name recalls the one
place where to drink water is an impossibility, and the absorption of
Hollands a necessity. See Murray's Guide as to the Hague and the
quality of the water in the Low Countries. When we went there
we followed the guide-book's advice, which was similar to Bailey's,
at Mrs. Todgers's—" Don't touch none of it;" and, as may be
imagined, we had a very Murray time of it. Hoop! Mynheer
Boompjes!

AT the Old Manor House and ancestral Hall,
Where the ivy climbs over the gable-end wall,

And, time out of mind, as the talk hath been.

That sweeps into the chambers, and out again,
And anon there appeareth an ancient Dame,
Like a ligure stept out of a picture-frame,
In a stomacher, frill, and farthingale,
And her eyes glimmer through an antique lace-veil.
O, the Family Ghost!

There's a room where the Ghost is given to keep
So in that one apartment that none dare sleep.

In your stuccoed Villas it scorns to dwell;
Stands only the hold of your high-born Swell.

Where, if ghost-stories then be but_trulyitold,
It could, an it listed, a tale unfold.

THERE is no truth in the report that, in view of his
exaltedjlineage. Baron TENNYSON will adopt as his new
motto, "Kind hearts are more than coronets, and simple
faith than Norman blood." These trifles are left for the
consideration of Lady CLARA VERE DE VERE.
AN EXAMPLE AND A PUZZLE.
Miss MAET ANDERSON* is an ornament, and a very beautiful orna-
ment, to her Profession. An eminent Financialist (says 'Truth) asked
her, through Mr. MITCHELL, what her terms would be to come to his
house, dine, and amuse his guests afterwards. To which she replied,
that she was not on hire for dining or evening party purposes. We
hear, also, that she did something better even than this, of which it
is not our metier to speak more plainly.
But what a contrast between the conduct of La belle Americaine
and that of the French artistes who honour us with their presence
during the Season! Of course our English Actresses never do the
drawing-room show business with dinner included, refreshments and
supper thrown in. Fancy the snubbing that an invitation of this
sort (sent through Mr. MITCHELL, or any leading Librarian) would
receive from Mrs. KENDAL if requested to recite Galatea, for example,
or from Miss ELLEN TERRY if invited to come out as Heta (or Gamma,
which was it ?) in The Cup! or from Miss ELLEN FAEREN if asked
for La Boulonnaise in costume, or from Miss KATE VAUGHAN if
invited to do three of her inimitable dances after dessert! What
a Snob must the host be! and what a host of Snobs at the party!
Yet it used to be done once upon a time, when, as " the Profession"
didn't think quite so much of itself as it does now, it certainly was
not thought so much of by " Society."
Tempora mtttantur—but not to any very great extent. Lady
THEODORE MABTIN or Mrs. CHARLES KEAN in their time would have
sent the same answer to the snobbish Financialist as Miss MART
ANDERSON has done. But how about the Operatic Artistes who are
both Actors and Singers? Why should they take pay for an evening's
drawing-room show and not be considered as doing anything deroga-
tory to their artistic position? Why should an Entertainer, who is
in every respect on an equal footing with the Actor or Operatic
Singer, take his honorarium for amusing the company after dinner,
or at an "at home," without injuring his position, socially and
professionally, while the opportunity of making twenty guineas, by
a recitation or a dramatic monologue in character, is denied to the
Actor or Actress, without forfeiture of social or professional status?
Something wrong here, evidently,—but we were not "born to set it
right."
A NEW PART FOR A BART.
TITE blithesome Bart, has in his time tried most things. But till
reading the following advertisement in the Daily Telegraph, we were
not aware that he had turned his attention to letting lodgings:—
A BARONET and his Wife will bo glad to meet with a Lady (who
may desire a quiet, comfortable HOME in the Country) to reside with
them. An invalid or elderly Lady would receive every kindness and atten-
tion.—Address, &c.
Here is an opportunity for elderly Ladies to have a real good time.
Fancy the pleasure of being supported bv the bart-ly arm to dinner,
having tea handed by a real red bart-ly hand, and in listening to
words of wisdom that fall from the bart-ly lips. This utilisation of
title is a capital hint, and doubtless Dukes in difficulties, moneyless
Marquises, and the impecunious aristocracy generally, might make a
fortune by letting lodgings in this fashion.
MR. BELT takes the £500, a slice instead of the whole hog for our
Pyg-malion. Tisn't much gain, but he is content to put up with a
certain lawes. "Non ultima tans est"—is this the last of LA WES?
THE Aldermen have named Mr. COBEIE GRANT, Mr. IN-CORRI-GIBLE
GRANT.

CHAPTER III.
HE dinner was over now, and my five
Uncles were writhing with great
difficulty towards their five respec-
tive rooms.
Yes,—there was no doubt of it,
the dinner had been a great success!
Had I deserved my good fortune?
I think I had.
I had determined, as far as it were
possible with the means placed at my
disposal by the accommodating condition of the existing law, that my
little inaugural banquet should materially assist and supplement, by
a few swift and deadly strokes^the surer if slower work that was to
be accomplished when it was over by my reeking walls and defective
drainage. It was a modest resolve, and I was not destined to be
disappointed.
I had arranged the menu withTgreat care, and had selected my
provisions with considerable tact. The fish, a fine full-sized cod\
was one of the three hundred and
seventy-five that only a few minutes
after my purchase were seized by the
Authorities and ordered to be instantly
destroyed as a nuisance dangerous alike
to health and life in the
immediate vicinity of the
consignment. With my
meat I was even more
happy! Through the
spirit
and
energy
of my
butcher,

whose enterprise was'great in supplying the neighbourhood with
prime but disease I joints that were quite unfit for human food, 1
was enabled to
secure a portion of
a condemned car-
case well suited
to my simple pur-
pose. I was not
surprised, there-
f ul after the soup.
But the incident
merely encouraged
me. With a care-
less toss of the
head, I ordered
the waiter to open
the Champagne.
It was a fine dry brand, noted for its richness in sulphuric acid,
and for the large amount of metallic salts it held in suspension.
That it was an excellent wine at nineteen shillings a dozen, I knew;
and had I required any further proof of its quality, it would have
been furnished by the three waiters who assisted on the occasion,
who, dividing a bottle and a half between them in the passage, were
all buried, with an. open verdict, on the following Tuesday. But I
am digressing. Let me revert to the dinner.
Like a true artist, I had not relied solely either on my principal
dishes or even on my wine. I had contrived other and more dainty
coqueteries de malaise to tempt my unsuspicious guests. The French
beans were bright with arsenic, and I helped them lavishly. The
custard pudding was made with milk direct from a farm noted for
its foot-and-mouth disease, and it went round twice. All this filled

me with quiet hope. But my chief piece de rtsiatance was a dish of
tinned rabbit.
As a plate of this deadly entree was placed before each of my five
Uncles, and they began to pronounce it "excellent," my heart posi-
tively beat with excitement. For a moment I was almost scien-
tifically interested, like one assisting at some pleasing and novel
experiment.
For I recalled the celebrated luncheon of the poisoned tarts given
by BENEVENTTTO MARAFFI, Fourth Duke of Milan, to HILDEBHAND
THE NINTH and the Doge of Venice, and remembered how, when the
latter had taken seventeen in succession, he turned, much to the
astonishment and amusement of the Venerable Pontiff, a pale orange
colour. So I watched my Uncles narrowly.
I had not long to wait. The cheap tinned poison of the American
firm soon showed itself more searching and potent than the price-
less preparations of Tofana.
Yes; there was no mistaking it! One by one my five Uncles turned
slowly to a deep rich emerald green!
My first impulse was to jump on my chair and cheer; but they
had risen to their feet, and were asking for a little water, and by a
great effort I restrained myself. There was a huge tankard on the
sideboard, drawn fresh that very afternoon. It contained fifty-seven
per cent, of organic matter, and was supplied through a freely-furred
leaden pipe from a cistern I had carefully concealed from the Sani-
tary Inspector. I could answer for the quality of that water.
With a cheery " You '11 be all right, presently!" I forced a good
quart of it laughingly on each of them. As I suspected, it did not
refresh them; but its effect was marvellous.
At first they seemed stunned. Then the other four reeled blindly
in the direction of my Uncle the Doctor. He had only taken twice
of the rabbit, and appeared to understand them. He broke silence.
"I am afraid, my boy," he said, sobbing hysterically, "that you
have treated us too—too handsomely."
The others nodded assent, and leaned against each other]"for
support.
fl We are not feeling very well," he continued, "and I think, on
the whole, we would rather go to bed."
"The heat of the room ?" I asked, in a playful offhand.'mannerr
as I rang for their five candles.
"The heat of the room! that is all!" was the muffled and wheez-
ing reply.
I cut an involuntary caper, for I knew the End was near at last.
In another minute they were creeping slowly and laboriously up
the stairs, to their respective rooms, on all-fours!
CHAPTEE IV.
It was eleven minutes to eleven. So far things had gone well
beyond my wildest hopes. How did matters stand?
I had said to myself, "before the beginning of the new year!"
True, there were but seventy-one minutes left, yet I felt perfectly
sanguine as to the result. The last state of debility had been reached
with an ease that even at this grim hour pleased and interested me.
But the time had come for the house to do its work .' As I thought
of this, again my spirits rose, and I made my arrangements for the
night.
As a simple precaution against the stifling miasma of the premises,
I had provided myself with a complete diver's costume. In this I
now arrayed myself. Fitting on tightly the glass-eved helmet, that
had a moveable india-rubber pipe communicating with the outer air,
for purposes of ventilation, attached to it. 1 sat down in an easy
chair before the flickering tire, and waited the issue of events.
How well I can recall that little interval of expectant repose!
I remember smiling to myself inside my diver's helmet. I was
thinking of my five aged relatives upstairs, for, with a spontaneous
Christmastide irony, I had arranged the nomenclature of their
five rooms according to the insanitary peculiarities they respectively
possessed.
The titles flitted fancifully through my brain. "The Deadly
Damp Room," "The Open Sink Room," "The Poisoned Dado Room/'
"The Gas Escape Room," "The Frozen Chill Room." What a merry
sound they all had in this, the last night of the good old year!
So I smiled, for I was wondering which of the five would be the
first to do its work.
Yet, beyond the occasional upsetting of a wardrobe and a distant
oath or two now and then, there was no sound from upstairs. Some-
times I thought I heard violent footsteps, as if someone were dancing.
But they died away. Why was there no movement? Half-past
eleven struck. I grew anxious.
I could not well leave the room, on account of the limited length
of my protecting india-rubber pipe. To have taken off my helmet
now would have been to have risked much. I hesitated. Yet the
bells were already beginning to ring in the New Year. I rose
from my chair, when, to my great relief, I noticed that a figure was
standing in the doorway.
It had on a Military headgear, some Naval trappings, a dressing-
gown, and bore, under its right arm, five duly executed willg. I saw,
at a glance, it was my Legal Uncle, in a state of temporary inter-
mittent delirium.
"Ha! my boy!" he said, stumbling towards the table, and mani-
festing no sign of astonishment at my unusual costume. "We have
had a rough time of it upstairs—a very rough time—but had—thank
goodness—time to sign these. We have not forgotten you!"
"Thanks!" I said, with some feeling, as I took the promising testa-
mentary parcel from his shaking hand. "Are they really bad?"
The bells were ringing merrily on the midnight air. The sound
seemed to soothe him.
"It's all over!" he said, feebly shaking his head. "And I have
only about two minutes left myself. I '11 tell you what it is, my
boy "—his voice sank to a whisper now. "I'm afraid you've got
into rather an unhealthy house!
• ••••*
After the five funerals, the five wills were duly opened, with all
formality, in my presence, by my new Solicitor.
"Dear me!" he said, rubbing his eyeglasses. "Your Uncles
appear to have left all their property to an Advertising Company,
who are to expend the whole of it in the Sanitary Improvement of
Deadman's Terrace."
I had been listening attentively. I slipped off my chair.
"And the annuity of £6 13s.?" I asked, anxiously, as he kindly
helped me up from the floor.
"Has been thrown into Chancery by a maternal Second Cousin,
he replied, gently. Then he led me to a cab.
• ••••»
Years have sped now, and I often pass through the old neighbour-
hood. Bright children issue from the doors, buxom housewives
smile on the balconies, and vigorous and hearty fathers of large
families return every evening from the City. Yet there is nothing
to indicate a change—beyond a forest of ventilating shafts that now

tower and twist along the whole line of the familiar stucco facade.
"The healthiest block of houses in all London," say all the Agents.
"Strange, top!" they add, rubbing their heads, .and recalling faintly
certain insanitary rumours of vanished years.
Yes; "strange." indeed—but not to him who, like me, recalls,
as he gazes up at No. 13, the weird explanatory light it could throw
on The Secret of Deadman's Terrace.
Punch on Potation*.
TOE Hot- Water Cure is our latest of fads,
To cut out all tipples from Champagne to Whiskey.
Well stick, if you like, to the kettle, my lads,
Whose wits are too bright, and whose souls are too frisky.
But Punch has his own common-sense recipe,
A road to right happiness simpler and shorter;
He 'd counsel you, cutting prigs fiddlededee,
To keep in good spirits and out of hot water!
"Is HANGING PAINFUL?" — Under this title some letters have
appeared in the Pall Mall Gazette. It is a difficult question to
answer, as of course, it depends on what is hung. Some sky-highed
Artists say hanging is very painful to them at the Royal Academy.
WE have just received our copy of our Annual Invaluable Guide,
Philosopher and Friend, yclept Kelly's Pott-Office Directory. It is
a charming pocket companion, and delightful handy book.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEL
THE MODERN ARS AMANDI.
(By Punchius ATaso.)
CANTO VI.-MAMMA.
PUNCHTUS sat pondering1 o'er his mighty theme,
When suddenly a keen electric gleam

5V
Seemed to transpierce his sanctum's roseate shade,
And lo! a Presence! gorgeously arrayed
In glistening satin of soft Tyrian sheen,
"Invested with purpureal gleams," its mien
Gravely majestic; ample-shouldered, large,
Of such fair swell as CLEOPATRA'S barge
Breasted the Cydnus with. Erect she stood,
The British Matron; in no genial mood,
If aspect augured aught. Her greeting fair,
The courteous Sage his most capacious chair
Filled with her portly amplitude. Thence she
In round sonorous periods uttered free
Maternal thoughts, and, as in eclogues old,
By rushy brook or by close-wattled fold,
Virgilian Swains discourse, PUNCHIUS, well suited
To Mantuan grace with her interlocuted.
MATERFAIITUAS,
Punch, I presume?
PUNCHTUS.
Presumption is a word
Which to connect with you •
MATERFAMILIAS.
Don't be absurd!
What do you mean by " Love and laughter " ?—I
Uuote from your " Proem "—What's your aim, Sir f Why,
Love is no laughing matter,— or, any rate,
Marriage is not! You as a comic zany rate
The modern Cupid, make him talk that stuff
Which men call " satire." Pooh! We 're quite too tough
For all that sort of thing to trouble much.
A mother's heart male mockery cannot touch,
We've far too much at stake." But Punch, you know,
This Ars Amandi is not comme ilfaut,—
JOHN just explained it,—and I really think
As British Girldom's pet, you ought to shrink
From
PdNCHIUS.
Veiling satire with a genial laugh.
And teaching wisdom 'neath the cloak of chaff?
MATERFAMILIAS.
Oh, bother.' That's what JOHN calls " Big Bow-Wow."
But—girls are quite sufficient trouble note.
They do not want more " wisdom," I am sure,
But more docility. If you cannot cure
Their sentimental fads, at least don't turn
Their heads with—well, I 've really yet to learn
What you quite mean—but all this curious mixture
Of rhymes, and gods, and things. There'B one great fixture—
Oet married! Now, yoiir Cantos seem to sap
Its firm foundation.
PUNCHTUS.
How?
MATERFAMILIAS.
Well, dear Old Chap—
You are a dear, when you are nice, you know—
I really can't tell how, you fog me so.
I 'm not sure when you 're serious. But indeed
I must remonstrate.
PUNCHIUS.
Madam, pray proceed!
(To be continued.)
ROBERT'S CRISMAS STORY.
(As append last Summer.)
I WAS a staying at swellish Surbiton and had been ingaged at
Appy Ampton a waitin on won of my favrit Companies, the Jiners.
Ah them's good fellers, them Jiners is, and nose a glass of '47 Port
as quick as any Company in Lundon, aye and injoys it two, and
never refuses a second.
Well, as I was returnin home, I had sitch a singler adwentur as
mite be common enuff in new Amerikay or even in old Ireland, but
in that nice quiet plaice it did seem just a leetle staggerin.
Sornterin along quietly " by the margin of Terns s fare waters,"
as the Poet says. I took a seat, about harf way home, on a nice ard
wooden form with, not no back to it, kindly purwided by the lokal
orthoritys for tired trawellers of which I was jest a little one, wen I
was akorsted by a gentleman of not werry engagin aperience who
was so obligin as to inform me that he was quite down upon his
luck, and was gettin jest a bit desprit, and wood I kindly assist
him with the lone of five shillinx!
In course I told him as I hadn't no five shillinx to spare, as I was
only a pore Waiter, wen he sed as that story wouldn't wash, as any-
boddy who 'd bin akustomed to igh life could see at once by my wite
choker as well as by my manners as I was a Parson! and posserbly a
Bishup! Of course I was a good deal flatterd at his little natral
mistake, and said that as far as 6rf. would go he mite have it and
welcom. wen he suddnly quite haltered his manner, and said, as
money he wanted and money he must have, and putting his and in
his pocket he pulled out a rewolwing Pistol, and sed I shoud have it
for a pound.
I think I was never so fritened in all my life, and without stoppin
for to think wot was best to be done, I acshaliy gave him all I had
in my pocket, which was about 9s. 6rf., which he took with a cuss,
and putting the awful lookin weppen into my hand, and sayin
"Full to the muzzel," he ran along to the Park railings, jumped
over, and was off like a shot!
I set there, on that ard seat, with that dedly weppen in my grasp,
for I should think quite a quarter of a our, wundring what on erth
I should do with it.
Suppose, I thort to myself, a Pleaceman was to cum and see me
thus, armed to the teeth, how could I conwince him as I was only
a umbel Waiter who had jest made a purchase, and not, wot I looked
exactly like, a sangwinery Bugler or Highway Man! I dared not
put the cold fire-arm in my pocket, forjfear it mite be. as he had
said, loaded to the muzzel, and mite go off of itself. I had sumtimes
herd of these deadly weppens being loaded with slugs, and the meer
thort of such disgusting: Reptiles a crawlin about in my pocket,
gave me a fit of the shudders.
Presently I herd carridge wheels a comin nearer in the distance,
so in my hagony I rushea from my ard seat, ran along about 200
yards, and throwd it madly into the middle of the River, and then
took to my eels, like a guilty thing, and never stopt till I come to
the Ferry, when my trite was so great and my breth so short that I
coudn't call out "hover" lowd enuff for the Ferryman to hear me
for a matter praps of 10 minnets. and ewenshally retched home so
much more ded than alive oh! that my kind land lord insisted on
my sendin out for harf a pint of brandy, which he mixed with
some skill, and of which he most kindly partook of, share and share
alike.
Of coarse I esily misled my land lord by denounsing the Sammqn,
although, trewth to tell, it was remarkabel good, and so, after a lite
supper of pork chops and stout, to bed, to Ded, where I slept the
sleep of the hinnocent Waiter and not of the gilty assassassin.
I have for sum time left the shores of the silwer Terns, unless
indeed I may call it by that fond name at Londun Bridge, witch
mite be thort jest a leetle sorcaustio, so I mav safely reweal the fao,
that, if any one, inoludin the galliant Admiral of the Terns Conserwa-
tives, wants what I 've no dout is a butiful specimen of the hintrest-
ing article commonly called a rewolwer, all he has to do is to go to
the place atween Long Ditton and Ampton where the ard seat is,
and exacly 200 steps nearer Surbeton he will cum to 3 grate Trees,
ether Helms or Hoax, I don't know witch, but I thinks the former,
and nex to them is a werry big Tree with a broken bow, and exacly
opersit that, just 4 across the River, let him dredge and dredge, and
he's sure to find the Burgler's companion, and watever he may think
my dew, I will leave hintirely to his Honner to send me. ROBERT.

STRANGERS YET.
(A Suggestion far the Season.)
Is many a dreary ami desolate place has our Annual Quest in his
travellings found him,
In Tartar steppes, and in Lapland wilds, in fenny flats where the
wild-fowl cluster;
In snowy wastes where the frozen watch from the "Crow's ^Nest"
gloomily gazes round him,
And where on the edge of the Aretic'pack the ice-bound wanderers
mutely muster,
But where and when and in what chill clime has he ever chanced on
a scene so cheerless
As this of the opulent City's slums, from our pallid sun by the
brick-bulks hidden?
A scene to soften the cynic soul, to moisten eyes that are mostly
tearless.
And bring the cry of a bitter shame to laughter-loving red lips
unbidden.
Good Cheer? Old friend with the jovial front, you may take your
shibboleth old and pleasant
To warm-housed wealth and to humble ease, to labour brisk and to
age lone-stranded;
To prince and pauper, to Cit and clown, to lolling lady and toiling

E'en less than the show of the glittering shops, with their piled
good fare and their gilt and greenery.

no jot or tittle.
Say, genial Greybeard, what think you of our London waste and
its winter scenery?

of our Civilisation.

A cordon stern as the lazar's ban against the "coming of cheer and

Or ii there's aught that shall waken mirth in their palsied souls,

That draws their lips with resistless lure, and wakes their spirits to

And breaks as with hideous scoriae fire their life's monotonous low

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business. To Augustus Harris, Esq.
MY DEAR HARRIS,
You 'RE very busy with your Pantomime, of course, and
therefore can't spare any time to go and see pieces, least of all Melo-
dramas, of which, no doubt, you are tired. Of course you are. But
why be a Manager and play yourself? I know what you '11 of course
retort, "If you want a thing well donet NIBBS, do it yourself."
Precisely: "A thing "—but not several things; you can't do 'em all,
and even now, do you know, I am afraid that our dear BARRETT
will beat you hand over hand in sixteen-sheet posters and pictures
on the walls of our artistically decorated Metropolis. You 're not
easily vanquished in that line, but look to your laurels—count them,
gee they 're the right number, as I really think our dear
taken more than one leaf out of your laurel book.

ADELFHI.— Final Tableau from " ID the Ranks " and Among the Army
Files; or, Harlequin Otideon the Fleecer.
However, be that as it may, you are busy night and day, trying on
Big Heads, and showing the Harlequin how to do his jump through
the shop-front and so forth, and you can't go and see " In the Ranks"
at the Adelphi, which is the most stirring Melodrama I 've witnessed
for some considerable time. Why, even CLAUDIAN HERMAN might take
a lesson from the construction of this Drama, and benefit by it. It is
just the sort of thing I like, and, mind you, it is just the sort of
thing the Public likes. Of course, you will be delighted to hear that
the Adelphi was crowded. The audience was remarkably intelligent;
not the nypercritical, cynical, falsely-enthusiastic audience which
comes out for one night only, and that " the first night," but an ordi-
nary any-night-you-like's audience, settling down to the story from
the moment it began, becoming so deeply interested in the movements
of the personages in the Drama that they wept with Miss ISABEL
BATEMAN, the heroine, — they might have wept more if she had onlv
let them, — cheered the unhappy but excellent Mr. WARNEK in all his
troubles, so that the more he was persecuted the more they cheered
and applauded him, just to show that he still had some friends in front,
and hissed and hooted both the villains, but especially the darker-
dye'd of the pair, in so savage a manner, that it seemed to me
the Conductor of the Orchestra occupied a post of danger, as, if that
mighty Pit had only been tried a little more, they 'd have risen in
their thousands, swept away the occupants of the Stalls, or carried
them with them, and, overwhelming the Musicians, would have
wreaked their vengeance on that thorough-paced scoundrel (no words
can be too strong for his heartless and unprincipled conduct), Mr.
Gideon Slake{ — who, as represented by Mr. J. D. BEVERIDGE, has
night after night to bow his grateful acknowledgments with a
smiling face for this public testimonyjto his artistic merit. To be
hissed heartily for two or three hundred nights must be worth some-
thing when it has to be considered in a salary.
The Scenery! Mind you, you managed capitally in your last
iece, and so did our WILSON B. in The Lights of London and The
ilver King, but the effects, as a whole, were not a patch on the
mechanical changes of In the Ranks at the Adelphi. They are
wonderful in their succession and variety. My dear HARRIS, if your
Pantomime arrangements are not at this late date all complete, you
go in for something like this. Outdo it; as with fairies at work
on a Drury Lane stage, it must be outdone, or it is not worth doing
at all. But very soon Pantomime must devise something new, as
it will have been beaten out of the field by the mechanical Stage
arrangements for every new melodrama. But, dear me, when this
letter appears, crowds will be already besieging your Box-Offiee, and
Mils Cinderella will be just " coming out.
pi
S
The dialogue of In the Ranks is thoroughly good. There are no
long maundering soliloquies, no sermonising, and just such bits
of local colouring as you might expect from your old friends PETrrn-
cum-SiMS.
If you can get a spare moment, just go and see In the Ranks. I
haven't time to mention the Actors: they 're all good, specially Mr.
JOHN RYDER, who gets shot in the back for being out in Dingley Wood
(near Dingley Dell, you know, where the Immortal Pickwickians
went out shooting) when he ought to have been in bed, but he turns
up again all right in the last Act, and is hailed with cheers,—like
the ship which came to the relief of the wreck in the Bay of Biscay,
—by his friends the audience. Mr. GARDEN is capital, and so is Mrs.'
LEIGH. Wishing you success with your Drury Lane Annual,
I am your devoted NIBBS.
FLUTTERING A COLOMBIER.
MADAME (or Mademoiselle ?) SARAH BERNHARDT has not been much
before the public lately. To remedy this, "une ancienne actrice,"
one Mile. MARIE COLOMBIER, wrote and published about her what
Le Figaro calls "un abominable livre." Its preface led to a duel
between two gentlemen, and the book itself so riled SARAH, that,
unable to suppress the publication or to repress her rage, she visited
the ex-actress's roomSj and proved herself a considerable ex-actress
by exacting payment in full for what seems to have been a most
scurrilous attack.
The unhappy Dove-cottager, Mile. COLOMBIEH. flew from room to
room, pursued by the infuriated SARAH, who had commenced the
interview by walking up to her, addressing her with "quelques
epithetes depourvues d'amenite," and following these up with a
"violent coup decravache" full in the face. Then chairs, tables,
stools, and fauteuils were sent flying, visitors being present joined
in the row, until the ancienne Actrice was thoroughly en retrailc,"
and had succeeded in retiring altogether, bv the back-stairs, from
the scene of so many striking situations. Then SARAH "epuisee,
mais vengee," quitted the house, leaving the cravache as a trifling
memento of her visit for Mile. COLOMBIER. Thus ended the new
dramatic adaptation of The Ladies' Battle, and in an hour after-
wards SARAH was playing at the Porte St. Martin in the new Drama
(apparently of the old Astleyan type), called Nana Sahib, in which
two historical English characters, "Lord WISLEY" and "Lord
EDWARDS," seem to have distinguished themselves greatly.
LITERS HUMANIORES!
FIRED by the remarkable success that has attended his latest
epistolary triumph,—a letter addressed to an August and Royal
Personage,—the Great Philosopher of Humanity has just posted the
following:—
The limperor of GERMANY has often manifested symptoms of
light-headedness. The Emperor of GERMANY will restore Alsace
and Lorraine, and the head of BISMARCK in a hamper, to the Repub-
lic, and return the indemnity in a cheque, payable to bearer
(addressed, under cover, to VICTOR HUGO), and, without making
further inquiries, deserve all the profound thanks he can get from
the civilised world.
The Emperor of CHINA is an infinitely bigger fool than he looks.
The Emperor of CHINA will give and bequeath Tonquin, Dublin,
Bachnin, Mongolia, California, Sugar Candy, the two Tasmanias.
and the Gulf of Brechin to France (in trust for VICTOR HUGO), and
defray the entire costs of the transaction as charged by his (VICTOR
HUGO'S) civilised Solicitor.
A MOST generous subscriber to Truth's fund for the children in
Hospitals and Workhouses sent Mr. LABOUCHERE five thousand six-
pences for distribution on Christmas Day. He simply signed himself
"A FRIEND." May he never be "A Friend in need!" Happening
to mention this fact to a real Friend in need, he at once said. If the
same Gentleman will send me a similar amount, or double, I will
invest it for the dear little ones in—Turkish, until they 've grown
up." We don't think this generous offer will be jumped at; but if it
is, 85, Fleet Street, is the address.
SEASONABLE Acnwo CHARADE.—(Entered at Stationer's Hall.)—
What simple flowers suggest the idea of a diary P And the Respon-
dent will answer in action thus: first he will, as if pondering, utter,
—" TV";—then, as if he had suddenly hit upon the solution, he
will exclaim " O.' "—and lastly, he will name the diary "Letts."
REDUCTIO JAD ABSDRDUM.—The Question whether Mr. HORTON
should or should not be appointed Examiner in Theology may be
stated by another rendering of " To be or not to be"—i.e., Hort'un
or H'oughtn't 'un.'"

ALL HANDS TO THE-
CLOCK!
WE read the following para-
graph in the Daily News the
other morning, as we were
taking our breakfast:—
"This morning the new Clock at
the Law Courts (opposite Temple
BarJ will be formally handed over
to the Commissioners of the Office
of Works and Fubli« Buildings by
Messrs. GILLETT & Co., of Croy-
don, who have erected it. The
Clock will be started at 11'30 by
Messrs.BLOOMFIELP AND STREET,
the Architects to the Eoyal Courts
of Justice."
We were particularly care-
ful not to " take a walk down
Fleet Street" that morning.
We trust the Commissioners
were strong enough to hold the
Clock when it was "handed
over," and we are anxious to
know where it got to after
it was started by Messrs.
BLOOJIFIELD AND STKEET. Did
they start it with a flag, after
the manner of the great MAC-
GEORGE of Epsom Downs?
Did they sing a merry little
ditty—
Dickory, dickory dock!
We 've started the Law Courts'
Clock!
'Tis bound to go, say GILLETT
& Co.
Dickory, dickory, dock!
We trust there were no se-
rious accidents in consequence
of these horological sports.

tical jokes in the present day.

FROM London to Nice an
easy way of going, via Chat-
ham and Dover line, which we
see advertises arrangements
with sleeping-cars and through
Express from Calais, which is
delightful travelling; but the
best of it all, specially at this
season of the year, is the fact
that the starting-hour from
Victoria Station is 10 A.M.
None of your getting up by
gaslight shivery-shakery and
anathematising everybody,
L. C. and D. included; no
wretched going-to-be-hung
sort of breakfast; no forget-
ting everything at the last
moment because vou're half
asleep; no up-all-last-night
kind of feeling; and, in fact,
misery generally ; also, no cer-
tainty of indigestion and dis-
comfort on board the steamer
in the cold, damp, dark night,
when the horrors of the situa-
tion are trebled consequent
upon travelling by an after-
dinner train in the evening,
but a quiet, comfortable break-
fast at a reasonable hour, and
a fair start with all your wits
about you, a cigar and the
morning papers to occupy you
for an hour or so en route, a
fresh morning on the coast,
perhaps calm, but most pro-
bably sunny, and then arriving
at Calais in the very nick of
time for the excellent luncheon
that that first-rate buffet in-
variably provides. "Easy
come, easy go," sounds like
the motto for this Christmas
Service, which takes place
every Wednesday and Satur-
day. Brayvo, L. C. and D.!

A PLEA FOR CHRISTMAS.
THE cynics have sneered at all Christmas tradition,
And told us the time for festivity 'a fled,
With pitiless pens they explain our position,
In eager agreement that Christmas is dead.
They say that a person of culture it sickens,
To hear of the season in prose or in rhymes,
That Christmas was simply invented by DICKENS,
And went out of fashion with tales like The Chimes.
They 'd banish all talk of the festival season,
And rather remind us of duns and of bills,
They hold that the Yuletide should offer no reason,
For pleasant oblivion of sorrows and ills.
They write in fine scorn of all social enjoyment,
And vow that big dinners we ought to forsake,
In short every year many pens find employment,
In proving that Christmas is quite a mistake.
But is it? Go ask of the children who measure
The time till the day when they 're set free from school,
They '11 tell you be sure that they still can take pleasure,
__ In all the delights and amusements of Yule.
For them let the bright tree with presents be laden,
For them let the holly adorn all the house,
While every small man and each miniature maiden,
Will hang out a stocking for kind Santa Claus.
And as for the old folks, why pile on the splinter
Of beechwood, and gather your friends one and all,
Time was we wot well when this feast day of winter,
Made rich and poor mingle in cottage and hall.
So bring in the \ ule log and till up the flagon,
Though storms roar without, we will feast on this night,
And yonder the young ones shall play at snapdragon,
Or olush 'neath the mistletoe berries so bright.
Away then with sneers, be it ours to endeavour,
To keep the dear season as folks did of old;
The fame of the Yuletide shall live on for ever,
With warm hearts within, though the winter be cold.
'Tis well in a wearisome world to remember.
That holiday time may be ours now and then,
And one day must come in each dreary December,
Of peace upon earth and good will towards men!
THAT 's a quaint-looking Christmas collection of verse and prose
brought out by Mr. AUGUSTUS MOORE, and called Walnuts and
Wine. The contents are as attractive as the originals in the title,
and, thank goodness, far easier of digestion.
