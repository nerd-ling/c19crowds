Juke 28, 1884.j PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

F» R E FAC E.
DOCTOR PUNCH, the great International Hakim, was at the International Health Exhibition.
He had received (of course) an " ovation," as the sporting scribes love to call it, c umpired with which that given to
Archer after a great win, Grace after a gigantic score, or Hanlan after a twenty-length triumph, were a mere hushed
whisper. All other attractions of the colossal Show were for the time as completely eclipsed as Antony, enthroned in tho
market-place, at the approach of Cleopatra in her Nile-borne barge. But now he had courteously waved his worshippers
away for awhile, and retired with Toby to a quiet nook of the Old London Street, for observation and reflection.
"Tremendous spectacle, Toby !" soliloquised the Illustrious One. "He whom men called Dizzy should have lived
to see it. It might perhaps have pleased him oven more than, tho Primrose League. His improvised maxim, Sanitas sani-
tatum, omnia sanitas, is here substantially set forth. Here is the apotheosis of what he mystically adumbrated in his
celebrated triad, • the Tank, the Oven, and the Porch.' * A Policy of Sewage' is here matter not for light ridicule, but
for practical illustration. 'Twas vastly different in 1066!"
Toby, with a recollection of his Master's Fleet Street sanctum, and a comparative eye cocked at the " Three Squirrels,''
yapped an emphatic assent.
"Hygeia! Hygeia!
My popular one!
This splendid idea
Will have a big run!"
murmured Dr. Punch, parodying Poe's song to the Siren with ready neatness.
"Adsum !" said a voice at his elbow, soft and low, indeed, yet clear as a Belgian bell-note, and " musical as is Apollo's
lute." The very voice of Health!
Dr. Punch bowed profoundly. He recognised the Health-Goddess at a glance, though she bore not the classic insignia
of the Serpent and Cup. Dr. Punch noticed also that she bore not the Harbertonian Divided Skirt!
"Daughter of ancient ^Esculapius, and pet divinity of his modern representative, Richardson, this scene must be a
triumph for the Sire, the Goddess, and the faithful Votary!" said the smiling Sage, sententiously.
Hygeia stooped to pat the astonished Toby, who, " gazing on divinity " (though not " disrobed "), seemed for once to
have lost his usually dogged hold of the categorical imperative.
"The Greeks," said she—as it seemed a little irrelevantly—" had a fine sense of congruity and proportion in Art.
I do not mean the Art of Advertisement, which I doubt if they understood so thoroughly as you Moderns seem to do."
"Had they done so," said Dr. Punch, promptly, "they would doubtless have had a God of Hoardings, or a Tutelary
Divinity of Bill-stickers. You will admit, however, my dear Goddess, that your own votaries are more numerous and more
devoted than in the days, say, of Old London."
"Doubtless," replied Hygeia. "But they have not always that nuns $ana in corpore sano which they are so fond of
talking about."
"You mean that Sanitation, like Art, is dreadfully fad-ridden," rejoined Dr. Punch.
"Exactly," said Hygeia. "And fads mean mental disease and debility. Healthy minds throw them off as healthy
bodies throw off colds and megrims."
"Hurroo !" ejaculated the Sage, jubilantly. "You 're something liko a Goddess, you are! Haven't heard sounder
doctrine—from other lips than my own—for a long time. Your health, my dear Hygeia,—if that toast isn't tautological!"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Hygeia smiled the smile of placid appreciation. "Don't think I disparage this Show," said she, mildly, "It is
colossal, full of invaluable teaching, and very enjoyable into the bargain. Only, big as it is, it might be supplemented."
"Just so," cried Dr. Punch, emphatically. "Oh, Hygeia, what nonsense is talked in thy name! Talked by sensa-
tional savants, popular doctors, and rabid Dress-reformers, as well as by interested advertisers, and highfaluting guide-book
makers. But I see, Goddess, that, like Liberty, you are wiser than jour more wordy worshippers."
"That may easily be," responded Htgeia, quietly.
"This Show, as you say, is superb," pursued Dr. Punch. "If all have not sound bodies, it is hardly the fault of the
enthusiastic advocates of hygiene in Fjod, Dress, and the Dwelling. But as to the mens sana, a modern Juvenal might find
matter for cutting comment, eh?"
"Who would not wonder if such man there be?
Who would not smile if Punchius were he?"
said Hygeia, with laughing significance.
"My metier is not precisely Juvenalian," said the genial Sage. "But the bauble and baton may do as good work as
the scalpel. Mens sana! Ah, my dear Goddess, could you sanitate men's minds, the circle of your devout worshippers
would be indefinitely widened. A prophylactic against Fad, a cure for Cant, a dessicative for Gush, an antiseptic for morbid
Art, a PASTEUB-specific for political and religious rabies—these are the desiderata of mental hygieue. Fancy how much
sweeter life would be without Stage-fever, Art chlorosis, poetic Satyriasis, and Gladstonophobia!"
"Granted," sighed Hygeia, wistfully. "But who can minister to a mind diseased?"
"Nil desperandum!" replied Dr. Punch, cheerily. "You spoke of a supplement to this gigantic Show! I fancy
I can furnish such a supplement as you suggest •"
"Where 1 When?" interrupted Hygeia, eagerly.
"Here and now !" replied the Fleet Street Thaumaturge, promptly. "In compact compass, but all-comprehensive!
Its own guide, and requiring no illumination save its owii brilliancy! Advertising nobody, but helping everybody! Antidote
to Fad, Cant, Humbug, Puffery, Priggishness, Party Spirit, and all forms of mental disease and debility! Wholesome, spark-
ling, mind-bracing, soul-invigorating! No, it is not a mineral water nor a farinaceous food! But it is the healthiest and
most health-imparting thing in the Exhibition—or out of it! Coino hither and behold!"
And, leading the astonished yet delighted Health-Goddess into the presence of the waiting thousands of his
enthusiastic worshippers—the Representatives of all Classes and of all Nationalities—the DoctT of Doctors presented to her

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ROBERT'S DEFENSE OF THE ALDERMEN.
I don't at all know what things is a comin to, or where things is
a goin for to stop, hut change and halteration seems to he the only
things as is fixt and certain.
I went with my Son William the other nite to a Lecter on Her-
stronermy, and there we was told, among other little trifles, that it
was founa as it woudn't pay to make a Railway to the Moon, as it
woud take the " Flying Dutchman " hisself, and I don't Bpose as he
ain't no light wait, nearly ten months to get there, and, at Parle-
mentry Fare, woud cost about £1500 third class single. That wasn't
had to begin with. Then he sed as we was all] a turning round at
the rate of a thowsand miles a hour, and spining round the Son at a
thowsand miles a minnit! Well, this was quite enuff for me, and
so I left right off. In course I don't serpose for a momint as he
thort as we was sitch igerrant fools as to Sleeve him, and yet with
his black dress coat, and witc choker, and gray air, he lookt quite
like a respectabel old Gentelman, in fac he lookt a good deal like
a Butler or ewen an Ead Waiter, as wouldn't deceeve noboddy, unless
praps it was on that werry open queshun of '47 Port.
But the pint as strikes me is this, supposin as we are all a goin
this paoe at anythink like wot^the Professer sed,—and Professers, I
spose, does sumtimes speak the truth, like other peeple,—and are a
turning round at sitch a whirlegig, no wunder as we are all gitting
jest a leetle Dizzy. I need scarce say as I don't mean no Pollyticks.
Well, fust we has the shamfool slander of Dr. Tomson about Turtel
Soup and its accompanyments and its substetoots, but they all
wanisht, like the mourning due, at the carm 8nd disintrested state-
ment of the "Ship and Turtel" hisself, and the unlearned and
unexperienced Dr. had to epollygise for so hurting some of the finest
feelings of our hungry natur. As if that wasn't bad enuff, I acshally
seed last week, in one of our leading streets, a common sandwitch
feller with one bored on his back, and another on his front, stating
that Reel Turtel Soup coud be had at 2s. a basin!
Grayshus Evans, what next? as if any gentelman, let alone a
Alderman, could heat reel turtil soup out of a Basin! The werry
idear suggests thorts of the useful Steward. In course he would
drink his delicate acompanying Punch out of a pewter pot!
How one step down leads up to another!
I acshally saw the nex day the Chairman of the City Sewers—not
of coarse the Sewing JIachiners—a persition, one would think, enuff
to gratify the hambition of the aspiringest C.C. or M.P., a drinking
of Sherry with his Turtel!
And now cums the wust of all. A Mr. Cornet Grant, a Lawyer,
has bin a'calomelating the court of Aldermen to such a extent as I
coud never even a dremt of, ewen after an heavy supper of Stakes
and Stout. He has the ordassity to say as they gits into sich a state
of mops and brooms as would disgrace a dustman, and he apeals to
his perfeshnal egsperiense to justify his unfair charges. His perfesh-
nal egsperiense! What is it compared to mine? He is, it seams, a
mere reporter, whose dooty is to use his long ears. I am an Hed
Waiter, whose dooty it is to use his eyes. Then witch is the best
judge of undue elewation, eyes or ears? And even supposin as
such a accident was to appen as for a gentelman to suddnly find as
the strawberrys has disagreed with him, whose elp does he require?
The thing's too ridicklus to argyf y. I have had now nearly 20 years'
egsperiense as a Waiter, and 10 years' responserhility as a Hed 'un,
so I spose as I ort to know more than a mere City-School-Boy, which
he was! and I can say most truthfully as I never in all my long
perfeshnal career helped to carry out eather a Alderman or even a
Common Councilman, but my serwices was wunce requierd in sum
such delicate way, but it was not for a Corporationer or for a Livery-
man. No, it was for sumboddy werry diftrent from ether. He was
a reel live Hem Pea! who soon after was sent abroad to guwern
a Collony, and I never herd as his one little hact of forgetfulness
ever made him a wuss Guvnor than if he had gone about all his life
with the wites of his eyes turned up at the depravity of the hage.
My egsperiense of life tells me as there's many wuss things in this
wicked world, as I'm told it is, but don't beleeve it, than a glass or
two of good old wine. Of course, like ewery other good thing, it may
be abused.
There's quite as much arm done by heating in a hot room, as by
drinking, and more too, to my mind.
A fine witty affable generus Gentelman may sumtimes take praps
jest one glass of wine more than offishus reason would dicktate, but
he never stuffs hisself full like a biled Turkey. He leaves that sort
of temperance to a rayther uncertain class of perfeshnals, and to
Tea'totalers, who are Buttenly not total abstainers as regards Wittles,
but whose wunderful appytights is a caution to all us Waiters.
No, No, No. There are plenty of charges, no dout, as mite be
made, and made troothfully, against Aldermen and Common Consel-
men, for, of course, even them are men like the rest on us, but
jolly good 8pessimens as far as I sees and hears, but suoh charges
as them as was made the other day by Mr. Cornet Grant,—who
I alius thort was a Comic Singer at Mr. German Reed's, up at
Regent Street, and not a sollem Tea-Totalling Lecterer at Ipswnich
—is far too silly, and too unlikely, and too imposserbel to ever
have occured without its ever having retched ether my eyes or my
ears, witch it never did. Robert.

"The fact is, I—I don't approve of Married Clergymen I"

UNHACKNEYED YULE; OR, YULE-TIDE GUSH.
Even his mighty intellect oppressed, and his usually irrepressible high spirits saddened,
by reading all the Christmas articles in every one of the newspapers, Mr. Punch would
seriously suggest, and has actually invented, a New Game for Journalists." The sole object
of the inventor is to produce a novel and really readable column of printed matter for next
Christmas. Here are the rules :—
1. No allusions whatever to be made to Dickens's Christinas Chimes, to Washington
Irying's Old Christmas, or to the Grave-digger who punched the little boy's head for
whistling on Christmas Day.
2. Anybody who uses the words " Yule-tide," or "Yule-log," is immediately out of the
game.
3. No references permitted to the Druids, or the Roman Saturnalia.
4. No paragraphs to begin with " A Merry Christmas! And why not a Merry Christmas?
Is it not far better to be merry than to be, &c, &c. f" or with "To-day the bells from
many a tower and steeple ring in the season of Good-will, of Merriment, of, &o., &c."
5. Nobody to mention plum-pudding. Turkeys only to be used with a good deal of fresh
stuffing.
6. Any words expressive of the slightest tolerance for " Waits " subject the Tlayer to a
heavy forfeit.
7. Players to take for granted that the public is already acquainted with the uses of Holly
and Mistletoe as decorative agents, and these, therefore, are not to be mentioned at all.
8. No Scandinavian "lore" about Mistletoe to be trotted out on any pretence.
!). Feelings of gushing benevolence to the poor (on paper) to be sternly repressed.
10. Articles to be as short as possible.
11. If possible, no articles at all to be written.
By an attention to the foregoing rules, newspaper writers may really hope to produce
something quite new and original a propos of what they generally call "the saored season,"
and Mr. Punch himself may be able to look forward in 188-1 to a comparatively " Merry
Christmas."
THE NEW YEAR.
A New Year! Turn another page,
Life's ledger haply needs fresh ruling.
How fares it with us since the age
When we were first set free from school-
ing?
Call back from out the spectral past
Remembrance of the vanished faces,
That peopled hours too bright to last,
In years that lied with lightning paces.
How strange it is in later days
To think on dead youth's lost illusion;
The world seemed fair then to our gaze,
And not all chaos and confusion.
We had beliefs,—where are they now P
We loved, — where are tho loves we
cherished '<
0 high resolve and steadfast vow,
How came it that so soon you perished?
Where are the comrades of old time,
Who swore to scale tho heights of glory,
And win with us in prose or rhyme
A name in unforgotten story?
They 're not such famous men to-day,
While we o'er laurels hardly may crow,
Ah well, 'twere courteous to say,
'Tis " Carent quia cute sacro."
Contrast those halcyon days with these,
Then bowed we to the smiles of beauty,
Then pleasure had the power to please.
And friendship seemed the dearest duty.
Now pleasure's like the treadmill's wheel,
The fire of friendship waxes duller,
And beauty somehow seems to steal
From Art, what once was Nature's colour.
And mark the aspects of the age,
In truth no pleasant panorama,
Here wanton children take the stage,
There runs the blood-and-thunder drama.
A time of sham aesthetic tastes,
Life's riddle pales before acrostics,
And girls with suicidal waists
Will pose as drawing-room agnostics.
Existence bores us—shameful word,
With all that life can spread before ns;
Now earnestness is held absurd,
And 'tis our sapless souls that bore ns.
"Lycoris life requires an art,"
So wrote the pensive Hard of Rvdal;
And ours is, moulding on the mart
One deity, a golden idol.
So close the book, the past is dead,
Or if we write upon its pages,
As on a palimpsest be read,
A nobler record for the ages.
Life's lessons have been dearly bought,
And good and evil masters claim us,
Yet surely all the Past has taught
But little if the Future shame us.
The PUTs Progress.
To believe that mere pills Will cure all
human ills, Is hard, save those ceri/ strong

A Trite Story.—On Christmas Eve a well-known Low Comedian
of philanthropic tendencies gave a tea-party to one hundred poor
children. In order to ensure the absence of uninvited guests, a
trusty Cerberus was placed at the door to verify credentials. Pre-
sently there arrived a youth of some seven Christmases, who was
unknown to the watchdog. The following conversation then ensued:
—Q. "What's your name, my little fellow?" A. "Tommy."
Q. "What's your surname?" A. "Dunno." Q. "What's your
father's name?" A. "Dunno." Q. "Well, what does your
mother call your father?" A. (promptly). "A drunken beast!"
Placed at the head of the table.
Overiieard outside the Lark Club on the night of a police foray:—
"Deuced hard lines, wasn't it, dear old Chappie, that we couldn't
finish the game?" "I believe you, dear Boy; tmt the hardest lines
of all were that you had my ready-money sovereign, and I've got
several monkey'sworth of I.O.U.'s. Toss you double or quits!"

LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business. 1. To Mr. Frederick Voices, about Drury
Lane Pantomime. 2. To Miss Anderson, about the Oaiety, 8. To
Mr. Charles Harris, about Her Majesty's Pantomime.
1. To Mr. Frederick Vokes.
My dear Vokes,
Don't be anxious. Drury Lane's all ri(fht. First-rate
Pantomime, hardly ever seen a better, except Aladdin, in which you
and your sisters (hope they are all in the best of spirits) took part,—
took prominent parts, I should say. Sorry that on account of your
professional engagements elsewhere, you were unable to "meet me
at the Lane when the clock struck nine," or rather earlier; but I
was there, and hasten to give you the first and the best intelligence.
Your big heart will go out to Augustus Harris, as Wilson Bar-
rett's does every night to Almida Eastlake, and you will rejoice
with Augustus, I know, when you hear that Cinderella is a Big
Success. It is emphatically and pre-eminently what, as you and
your sisters have often said, a Pantomime ought to be—that is, a
Children's Pantomime—popular story simply and dramatically told,
full of movement, resplendent with glitter, with' a sufficient spicing
of that broad humour and practical fun without which a mere spec-
tacular Pantomime is only a splendid failure.
I trembled, my dear Frederick Vokes, before the Curtain went
up after a rattling overture, " personally conducted,"—as might be
said of Sir Arthur Sul-
livan on the exceptional
nights (he is himself an
exceptional Knight) when
he wields the baton at
the Savoy,—by Mr. Oscar
Barrett,—"not 'Clau-
dian' but another,"
lest there should be no
Big Heads. On they
came, a whole family of
'em, with strong family
resemblance, all looking
better than ever, so
stolidly idiotic, and with
such beautiful complex-
ions, that I could not
resist applauding them
heartily, and, had I
known they were coming.
I would have showered
upon them the choicest
bouquets. From the mo-
ment I saw these Big
Heads, I felt the success
of the Pantomime was
assured.
I saw the Author, Mr. E. L. Blanchard, enter the Stalls and
courteously decline to purchase his own book, which was offered to
him by one of the neatly-attired Chambermaids, who only want a
bed-room candlestick in their hands to complete the illusion, and I
expressed to him (in pantomime of course, as he uses no other means
of communication), that the Big Heads had done the trick, and that
Cinderella was already a^triumph.
The opening scene set every one applauding heartily, and the
indefatigable spirit of Miss Victor ana Mr. Harry Parker, as the
Baroness and Baron Filletteville, was of the greatest service to the
general " go," both hero and throughout the entire Pantomime. It
is just the very sort of Pantomime you and your family like, my
dear Vokes, as the fun is not confined to two or three people, but
there's something for everybody, and not a moment's cessation of
music, not a single pause in business or dialogue throughout. Fond
as you are of your joke, and a capital one it was when you first made
it, you and your family (may they live long and prosper !) would be
the last persons to act on the principle of Vokes et prceterea nil.
The proud and cruel sisters are always played by men, and this
year their representatives are Mr. Harry Nicholls and Mr. Her-
bert Campbell, who act together well on the give-and-take prin-
ciple—the former, however, keeping, as he generally does, the
greater part of the fun to himself. You, my dear Vokes, would
perhaps t>e rather irritated by this quiet humour, as you like an
Actor to face the audience antt to speak his lines well out. I quite
agree with you; but for all this Mr. Harry Nicholls is very funny.
Cinderella herself is played by Miss Kate Vaughan, who looks
charming, and is elegance, grace, agility, and dramatic caper-bility
combined. Her dancing is perfect of its kind; but she is so clearly
of opinion that the Public ought to be contented with what she has
been giving them for the last six or seven years, that she does not
care about doing anything new in the dancing line, and I am sure,
my dear Frederick Vokes, you would be the first to tell her that

Harris trying it on at Drury Lane
and most successfully.
the constant repetition of the same dance, the same action, and the
same fun, palls upon the public after a few years of it. Your motto,
and that of your talented family, is " Keep moving!" Mention this
to Miss Kate Vaughan, will you, if you have the hoppy-tunity?
But there it is. The more you give me,—I represent the Public, I
believe,—the more I want; and if I have exquisite dancing by
Mile. Palladino, lines well and clearly spoken by Miss Victor and
Mr. Parker (by the way, no one says ner lines better than Miss
Vaughan—when there's a chance of getting 'em out, and attended
to, either on or off the stage on Boxing Night), and not only metrical
lines properly delivered, but also good songs artistically sung by
Miss Kate Sullivan, is it not greedy of me, I ask myself, am I not
a Gorgibuster to demand that all these qualifications should be united
in Miss Vaughan, who is an ideal children's Cinderella,—and this is
a great point, as you and Miss Victoria are perfectly right in always
showing a child's heroine just as a child would expect her to be,—
but she is so clearly out of the rough and tumble of the comic business,
and has not a place among the fairies, and only one situation which
exactly suits her—when she is gatheriug sticks in the wood and
comes across the bridge and across the Prince at the same moment.
This last is a charming idyllic bit—only a bit; just enough, and no
more,—and the bundle of faggots Miss Vaughan carries are the only
sticks in the Drury Lane Pantomime.
A propos of sticks reminds me of hitches, and how you would have
sympathised with the Stage Manager—when one of the ponies
specially imported and trained," says the playbill, "for this
Pantomime," snowed how his nasty temper had been imported with
him, and how not all the training,' nor all the fairies in the world
could make him move if he didn't feel so inclined. If he docs this
again, (the island this pony comes from can't be Shetland, it must be
'•(Kb ") Cinderella should get out of her carriage and sing, " If I had
a pony what wouldn't go 1 "—but, oh, my dear Frederick Vokes,
what a lot of "ponies" do go in getting up a Christmas Panto-
mime! You and Mr. Leader, both together representing a
"Volks-Lieder" entertainment, know that a Pantomime is not to be
got up for a mere song.
But you will be anxious to know what is the Great Effect of the
Drury Lane Pantomime? "Well, it is the Grand Procession of
Fairy Tales, which includes the
Knights, in full panoply, dancing
attendance on the Seven Cham-
pions, and the entire Band of
the Forty Thieves safeand sound,
and not " done in oil" by Mor-
giana, blazing away in Oriental
armour. Such a picture, full of
the most varied costumes, alive
with giants with famous big
heads, dwarfs with wonderfully-
designed masks, champions,
kings, queens, pages, courtiers,
&c, &c., I do not fancy that
even you, my dear Vokes, with
all your vast experience, will
remember having seen for some
considerable time.
All the Fairy Tales came on
in excellent order, every set
complete except one, and that
was Aladdin's lot, which would
have been perfect but for the
regretted absence of Abanazar
the Magician, with the tray of
Lamps. I saw him arrive after-
wards, and try to sneak in, as if
he belonged to the party of one of
the Seven Champions of Christendom; but they wouldn't have him
at any price, and the unpunctual Magician was hustled off the top of
the steps, and shoved away somewhere at the back, whence he never
subsequently emerged. It will teach that Magician to be in time
another night.
This being the climax, they ought to get to the transformation
scene as soon as possible; but they didn't on Boxing Night; and I
am sure that, were you behind the scenes here, you would have the
"business" m the Black Castle scene cut down to just as much as
might serve for the arrangement of Mr. W. R. Beverley's Home of
Light and Love, which, considered by itself, and quite apart from
the Pantomime story, is one of the most effective and most artistio
spectaoular tableaux that even he has ever done.
Then, after we had said good-bye to all the characters (Cinderella
herself has almost disappeared since the Kitchen scene), there was a

their own trumpets, but Mr. Augustus Habbis's, for this occasion
made and provided, sounding: as shrill as those in Aida, and, after a
sort of Eden-Theatre effect had been reproduced (but not quite it)
from a wonderful ballet which, no doubt, you saw in Paris—I mean
Excelsior—then, my dear Fred. Vokes, it would have done your
honest heart good to have heard the vociferous cheers for " Harris!
Harris!" And the thought flashed across me at the moment:
Suppose some wag in the guise of Sairy Gamp should suddenly quote
that worthy old lady's remark, and shout out, " I don't believe there

and there been confronted by the astounding fact of not one Harris
stepping before the Curtain and answering to the clamorous call,
but two—Les deux Ajax !—two Harrises in the field, both having
worked at getting up this splendid Pantomime; for is it not in the
bill that " Augustus Harris" was " assisted by Charles Harris "?
And would you, my dear Vokes, (how well I know your generous
instincts!) would you, I say, have found a dry corner in your eye
when the Elder Brother, Augustus, stretched out his fraternal arm
and dragged forth from his lurking place, somewhere in the vicinity
of the Prompter's box, the modest, shrinking, retiring form of his
own Brother, the real " Charles, his friend'?
Yes, my dear Frederick Vokes, I am not ashamed to say it, there
were manly hearts in Old Drury that night that were deeply
affected by this touching sight. There were noses blown, and pocket-
handkerchiefs used, ana lorgnettes put up, and the old soldier (who
was he, think you, mon cher Vokes?) wiped away a tear, and,
stifling his emotion, shouted and hurra'd with the best of 'em. I
would you had been there! But legs or no legs, you cannot be
everywhere, and as you are now singing "How happy could I be
with Leader," I must come and see your show at Her Majesty's,
and with best wishes for the New Year to you and your family,
I am yours sincerely, Nibbs.
2. To Miss Mary Anderson.
Mr Dear Miss Anderson,
I regret that you were unable to be present at Drury Lane
on Boxing Day, as you would then have seen what a real mixed
London audience is like, from the Peer of St. James's in a private
Box, up to the Prig of
St. Giles's in the Upper
Gallery. And then to see
them all standing up to
hear the National Anthem,
and to cheer it enthusi-
astically without a dis-
sentient voice this year at
the finish! We are not
too go-a-head a people as
you are aware, and our
constitution will have to
undergo a very radical
change ere we become
impatient of " Ood Save
the Queen" and don't
care for a really good
Pantomime, and cease to
enjoy a hearty laugh at
any genuinely comic re-
presentations of our publio
characters, whose popu-
larity or unpopularity is
the measure of our enjoy-
ment of their caricatures.
You've made a hit, my
dear Miss Mary Ander-
son, and are just now
deservedly a favourite,
and especially, 1 may
add, and lay stress on the
fact because of its rarity,
with your own sex, who admire you as an Artiste/respect you as a
Lady, and are eager to welcome you as a guest from America.
If, then, you near that across the road at the Gaiety Theatre,
Galatea and Pygmalion (" re-versed," the wags, Messrs. Stephens
and Wareham have it. you '11 observe, for it is in rhyme, as were
the old French tragedies and comedies) is being received nightly
with roars of laughter, don't you suppose that you are the object of
their mirth. Very much the contrary. There's nothing about you
in the short burlesque at the Gaiety, which has no more to do with
the eccentric modern comedy in classic dress—almost a burlesque
in itself from the very nature of the case—in which you play the
statue and walk the boards " like a thing of life," than it has with
the French Opira-Bouffe (taken, I believe, from the German) on the
same subject, which was a stock-piece in Paris long before Mr.
Gilbert gave his amusing twist to the legend.
At the Gaiety Miss Ellen Farren is Galatea the Sculptress, who

Galatea an
A
ygmalion in Statu Quo; or,
> of the Old Bloke.
has fashioned hut not finished the statue ef Pygmalion, which is sud-
denly vivified by the Gods in the Gallery, to whom Galatea appeals.
Galatea is not dressed a bit like your Galatea (which I think is a
mistake, as the 8culptress looks more like a boy than a girl,—but this
kind of costume has become a tradition at the Gaiety, where the Ladies
prefer being " boys "), nor are you in any way caricatured, though of
course you might have been, andpretty broadly, too, in the good old
palmy days of Burlesque, when Wright and Paul Bedfobd, at the
Adelphi, dressed up as Adalgisa and Norma, the latter with a wreath
of turnips and carrots round his head, and Miss Woolgab was the
Pollio,—or when Robson caricatured Ristobi as Medea, and men
in petticoats were almost as common a sight on the Stage as were the
youths who played the heroines in Shakspeare's time.
A lot of girls are dressed as statues, and there's a chorus of them,
and a chorus of visitors to Galatea s studio; and after a song or
two,—the tunes are very good—and a very grotesque dance by Mr.
Elton and Miss Fabben, we get to the real fun of the fair, which
is Mr. Terby made up as a statue; but not as you,—though, for the
boisterous fun of the thing, I wish he had been,—and wouldn't all the
Critics have been down on the unfortunate Author had he ventured on
treatment which would have been a matter of course years ago, but
which would now only be reprobated as a matter of coarse treatment.
Mr. Tebby is very funny in this, which it is the more difficult for
him to be, as he has been very funny in The Rocket previously.
I hope you are getting some amusement. Go and see Mr. Pineeo's
new Comedy when it comes out at the Globe, on the withdrawal of The
Glass of Fashion—which is now going for a theatrical tour in India,
where Mr. Grundy won't find it's so hot as the Critics tried to make
it for him here on its first appearance. Mr. Pinero will then have
three pieces running simultaneously at three different theatres! Isn't
it wonderful! I am informed that Mr. Fbank Gbeen, the Author of
the Pantomime at Her Majesty's, has thirteen Pantomimes running
at thirteen different theatres. Reckon this at five thousand for each
Pantomime, and ask Mr. Gilbebt, when you 're rehearsing Tragedy
and Comedy, if that isn't good business for one year. Wishing you
a very happy New Year, I sign myself Your hearty Admirer,
Nibbs.
3. To Mr. Charles Harris, Dr. Augustus Harris's Assistant.
My deab Mb. Charles Harris,
As you can't get away from Drury Lane Stage, I write this
to tell you about the old-fashioned" Pantomime at Her Majesty's.
You'd be immensely pleased with the Dance of Children all round
Miss Jessie Vokes, and with the Fat Boys' Chorus, quite a gem of
melody and humour, and you'd applaud with all your might and

The Yokes Family, " With Powers to add to their number.
main the admirable drilling which Mr. Levey, the Conductor—(Do
you know Mr. Levey, the Conductor P If not, you ought to)—has
given these little ones. Then the mechanical change from the Snow-
covered Market-place to Summer Fairy Bowers, I assure you, is so
perfectly managed, .and so admirably contrived and neatly carried
out, that, had there been time. I could have sent a cab to Drury
Lane in order that you might nave galloped round, and seen this
excellent mechanical effect for yourself. Then the Hut Soene, with
the old Grandmother and the sensational fight! How pleased your
dear brother Augustus—(pray remember me to him!)—would nave
been, for I assure you it is almost the real thing.
I haven't the pleasure of Mr. Harry Payjte's acquaintance, but
do tell him that he would be charmed with the Harlequinade at Her
Majesty's, where there is such a pretty Harlequina (I don't like
Harlequinas as a rule), and a very attractive Columbine. I'm
certain that, if you could see the Transformation Scene, you would
be as pleased as if it had been at your own place. If you 've never
seen the Vokeses dance all together, you ought not to miss it. Of
oourse, you are a thorough Musician among other accomplish-
ments, so do ask Mr. Oscar Babbett, your Conductor, to inquire of
Mr. Levey of Her Majesty's if he isn't enraptured with the melodious
operatic finale of one of the scenes, and ask (Mrs. Nibbs particularly
wants to know), if Miss Victobia Vokes, the Vokes-alist, is Mr.
Levey's prize pupil. Ah! my dear Mr. Charles, you have a great
treat in store for you. Yours admiringly, Nibbs.

THE SPEAKER.
(A Handbook to Ready-made Oratory.)
Part X.—The Festive Season and the Home Circle.
It is seldom that a dinner celebrating a family gathering, held between
Christmas Eve and Twelfth Night, passes without someone or other insisting
upon making a speech.
Very often the address is commendably short. It may be that a needy connec-
tion rises merely to propose the health of all his rich relatives. Then the speaker is
satisfied with a pointed allusion to the duties of property and the honest pride of
the deserving poor. On another occasion a garrulous and tactless uncle insists
upon "saying a few words," avowedly in honour of his host, but really to hat
host's utter confusion. As giver of tne feast, the host is naturally well-to-do,
and wishes it to be believed that his fortunes nave never been other than couleur
de rose. But this view does not commend itself favourably to the mind of the
garrulous and tactless uncle, who, having a retentive memory, can consequently
unluckily remember the days when the gentleman at the head of the table was
the forced companion of the "man in possession " of the house. This little inci-
dent in an otherwise fairly prosperous career, tho garrulous and tactless uncle
takes care to relate, to the intense confusion of the hero of the story. The
"incident" is the more rjainful. as a solitary mcmWnf fi»nVmmo ™*.ni.>;D
icident is the more painful, as a solitary member of the home circle is singled
disagreeable identification. If the whole of the familv were "in the
out for _. .n—■■miiiiinuMi ii uu> wuoie oi uie iamiiy were in in<
same boat," no one could claim an advantage, and justice would be appeased.
Moreover, the most distressing feature of these Christmas and New Year gather-
ings is the want of honesty that characterises them. Nine times out of ten,
jealousy, hatred, malice, and uncharitableness are all there, and yet unacknow-
ledged because concealed under a thin veil of sham geniality. Surely, in the
cause of truth it would be well to tear that veil aside, and permit the rarely-
united family to see its members in their real characters. This might be easily
accomplished, by a carefully-constructed speech delivered with a view to bringing
any little grievance and scandal to the surface of the after-dinner talk, so that
they might be ventilated. To explain more fully this suggestion, a dramatic
illustration is subjoined:—
SCENE—Interior of the Dining-Room of the Most Pros-
perous Member of the Familv. Holly and Mistletoe
everywhere. An excellent but indigestible Dinner
has just been consumed, and the Home Circle, con-
sisting of individuals ranging in age from seven to
seventy, are seated round the hospitable board, wear-
ing on their heads the paper contents of numerous
cosaque bonbons. A dead silence, and then Candid
Friend rises, with the intention of proposing a toast.
Embarrassing pause.
Candid Friend. I am sorry that you cannot give me
a heartier reception, but not surprised, for I know you
all! And knowing you all, I tell you that if there is one
thing in the world you cannot tolerate, it is the truth.
(Murmurs.) Oh, you may grumble, but for all that I am
right. I hate humbug; solet's have it out. To commence:
Who were Your host and hostess twenty years ago?
{Cheers.) Were they the heads of the family then?
(" No, no .'") And does it not look very much like pre-
sumption that they should be condescending—(ha! ha !—
condescending!)—to feast their betters — (thunders of
applause)—in a house much too good for them—(renewed
cheering)—which must bring them shortly into bank-
ruptcy? (" Yes, yes.'") They may say, and, in fact,
do say — very frequently — that they nave been very
generous to a certani member of the family
Elderly Female (interposing angrily). I insist upon
this matter being- cleared up. I know that it is thought
that I get a hundred a-year out of them. Nothing of
the sort. I am only paid ten pounds a quarter—
irregularly. [Recrimination.
Candid Friend (continuing). But we will not enter
into this. No doubt they may have grievances of their
own. For instance, it is possible that, had they all that
belonged to them, they would have had
Irritable Old Man (springing to his feet). I know
what you are going to say! I repudiate the insinua
tion. By the will I was to have all the silver with the
crest, ana the teapot had the crest. [Uproar.
Candid Friend (continuing when the storm has worn
itself out). But wny enter into little disputes that are
really beneath contempt? (Noise.) It is a far different
matter when questions of principle are involved. For
instance, nothing could be more improper—(" Hear,
hear.'")—nay, more disgraceful—(cheers)—than for a
man to refuse to act as an infant's Godfather 1
[Thunders of applaut
Benevolent-looking Individual (rising with a flushed
face). I don't agree with you, Sir! I did not fike the

Peppery Person (with red whiskers, angrily). And

[Tremendous row.
Candid Friend (after a pause). But what does it aU
matter? Things are so little! Tne Brown part of the
family may believe that they know a better set than the
Snooks part—(derisive laughter from all the Snookhes)—
or the Snookses may look down with supreme contempt
upon the society affected by the Browns. (Roars of
ironical laughter from all the Browns.) And no one need
trouble himself or herself as to whether the Joneses care
anything for old Miss Kobinson's little savings.
(Universal jeering.) What does it matter? It is so
much better to face the truth and get it over. Why
hide anything? Everybody knows that Matilda jilted
Paul when he lost his money—(uproar)—that Aunt
Leonoba tried her level best unsuccessf uUy to catch
Peter for his Cousin Beatrice, when he succeeded un-
expectedly to the Baronetcy—(renewed uproar)—that it
was Simon who got his poor Uncle Benjamin pilled for
the Camford and Oxbridge—(shouts)—that it was Jacky's
excesses on the turf that caused his Grand-aunt, Mrs.
Mumbo Jumbo, to leave all her property away from the
family, and to make a wiU in favour of the Royal
Hospital for Incurables. (Tells.) But all this is ancient
history, and what we have now to do is to heartily wish
each other a really happy, and prosperous, and, above all,
peaceful new year, so that

Great Western Railway
Company notify that the
loss of the South of Ireland
will not in any way inter-
fere with the regularity of

consequence of this an-
nouncement, it is probable
that the South - Eastern
Company will publicly de-
clare that the loss of the
whole of Ireland would not
interrupt the traffio be-
tween London and Paris.
The loss of England would,
however, most likely put
an end to the traffic be-

With Lopez and Partaga.

Come light the funeral pyre,
Nor bid the Corporation last
That lit the fatal fire.

And punch's fragrant flow,

Great Magog, and great Gog.
0! bid the fell Reformer come,

What Aldermen has killed;
Let ev'ry precedent be broke,

NEW" YEAH RESOLUTIONS.
Since this '84 is a new institution,
We '11 honour the year and turn o'er a fresh page.
Let each man and woman one pood resolution
Now make, 'tis a fashion which should he the rage.
Though Harrison raves about Comte and his preaching,
Enwrapped in a mad metaphysical mist,
Far better be sure is our sensible teaching—
Each positive man is a Positivist.
Let John, for example, leave practical joking
To others, and so escape family jars;
While Walter, whose highest ideal is smoking,
Gives up for the nonce Ms gigantic cigars.
Let Mary in future believe she can please a
Young " Chappie" by wearing her hair very plain;
And since it brings gout, we '11 suggest to Louisa
The manifest dangers that lurk in Champagne.
That third glass of Port and that ancient Madeira
Shall tempt us no more as they did in old time,
Henceforward we start on a virtuous era,
While bric-d-brac buying shall count as a crime.
So here's to the Year that has just dawned before us,
To fair Eighteen Hundred and Eighty and Four!
Our good resolutions shall echo in chorus,
And most people keep them—a fortnight or more!
Helps for Phelps.
"And did you not hear of a jolly young Waterman,
who at Blackfriars Bridge used for to ply? Of course
vou did. But what is more to the purpose, have you
heard that that jolly old Waterman. John Phelts, who
used to ply between Putney and Fulham, is at the present
time not so well off as he deserves to be. He is now in
his seventy-ninth year; he can no longer feather his oars
with skill and dexterity, the profession of Ferryman is
now wellnigh obliterated, and the rapid stream of progress
has left good old John Phelps stranded. Mr. Punch
sincerely trusts that the large armv of boating men, and
the many lovers of the dear old Thames, will all give
something to cheer the winter days in the life of this
Veteran. Subscriptions will be received by Messrs.
Robarts, Lubbock & Co.
A Proverb Applied.—No (English) man is a hero to

UNJUST RATES!
The two articles under the above heading by whioh Mr. Punch
has warmed the hearts and cheered up the spirits of the poor oppressed
Ratepayers of the Metropolis, have not by any means exhausted the
proline subject. They have, though, he is glad to read, so stirred
the very soul of the learned Professor who represents in Parliament
the Borough of Southwark, that he has publicly expressed his firm
determination to fight on the side of the poor oppressed occupier
against the rich unjust owner, "till the crack of doom.'" The Pro-
fessor does not, therefore, apparently anticipate an early victory,
but, like a gallant Professor as he is, intends to fight on till all these
cruel wrongs are thoroughly, or Thoroldly, remedied.
Mr. Punch will now, therefore, examine into the iniquities con-
nected with the charge for what, for want of a better name, is
generally called "water." First, as to its source. The far greater
portion of this liquid is drawn, as we know, from what is sometimes
still ironically termed the "Silver Thames." Of its constituent
parts we will say no more on this occasion than that if anyone
should, from any strange combination of circumstances, want a tho-
roughly valid excuse for not joining the noble army of Blue-Ribboners,
he has but to take his remonstratmg and unjovial friend to Staines,
or to one of the other towns above Surbiton that still drains into the
River, to be furnished with such a reason as would convince Sir
Wilfrid Lawson himself.
And now as to the prioe of this delicious compound, and how that
price is arrived at.
A mere simple innocent, unacquainted with the ways of Water
Companies, and their friends our wise Legislators, would imagine
that one would have to pay for water according to the quantity con-
sumed, and, should he be acquainted with the rather important city
of Berlin, he would know that in that oity of common-sense every
house is supplied with a water-meter as with a gas-meter, and that
the sensible Germans pay according to consumption for one as for the
other. In other places a different plan is adopted, but still to a cer-
tain extent a rational and a reasonable one: four shillings per annum
is charged for each room of a house, but with a constant supply of
water, thereby abolishing the nameless horrors of cisterns and water-
butts.
The poorest of the poor could not complain of that, as the charge
for a constant supply of water to their one poor room would be but
a penny per week. But either of these simple and reasonable plans
would be laughed to scorn by our own dear native caterers of what
is generally considered one of the necessaries of existence. So they
invented a scheme that for absurdity, for injustice, for dense stu-
pidity, except, of course, as far as their own interests are concerned,
was perhaps never equalled by bungling legislation, and under its
provisions we have to pay for the water with which we are furnished
not according to the quantity supplied, but according to the rent of
the house in which we happen to dwell!
Even this is not all, for, emboldened by their success and their
united strength, they insisted on charging their Water-Rate, not on
the same basis as all our other numerous Rates aro charged upon,
but upon the gross amount of the value of the premises without any
deduction! This was too much even for the long-suffering Rate-
payer, and a bold Citizen, not perhaps then " of credit and renown,"
but who deserves to be, so Mr. Punch immortalises him accordingly,
as T. J. Pearson, of Bishopsgate Street, City, actually brought his
case into a Court of Justice, and proved that his Water-Rate had
been increased from £1 16«. per annum to £6 16»., while his con-
sumption of water had considerably decreased, and, if supplied by
meter, the charge at the highest rate allowed would be five shillings
and sixpence! He was defeated in his gallant attempt, but well
deserves the thanks of every Ratepayer.
Then steps forward another gallant man, and being luckily a
lawyer as well as a water-consumer, he resists, as we have all read,

the attempt to make him pay on the gross value of his property,
instead of on its rateable value, and he fights the wealthy Water
Company first before the Magistrate, when he loses, then in the Court
of Queen's Bench, when he wins, then in the High Court of Appeal,
when he loses again, and then, with an undaunted pluck worthy of
all admiration, ne carries the case to the House of Lords, and then
wins, not only his own great battle, but our great battle, the great-
ness of which may be estimated by the fact, that the same statistical
genius who made our previous calculations has pledged his scientific
character to the truth of the astounding statement that it will save
the inhabitants of our Metropolis no less than £238,560 per annum!
We have requested one of our historical staff to search through the
records of History for all time, which of course he has done, with the
result that, with the exception of Julius Cssab,, when he left
seventy-five drachmas to each of the 463,642 Citizens of Rome, no
moh case of pecuniary benefit to an enormous population is on
record.
Mr. Dobbs fought a wealthy public Company single-handed, in
four different Courts of Law, with the certainty, if he lost the final
battle, of having to pay all the enormous costs on both sides,
amounting to many thousands of pounds; his own gain, if he won,
being a savin? of some thirty shillings a year, and the gratitude of
his fellow Citizens.
It is proposed to show that gratitude in a tangible form.
Gentlemen of the Metropolis, Mr. Punch ventures to suggest
"Three cheers for gallant Mr. Dobbs," and, as it is entirely a water
question, Down with the Dust!

aid not both actually think, I shall be able no doubt to prove that
one of them thought, that by jiving information of the meditated,

Bhould be eveutnally afforded to the Police, with the foreseen object
that some poor innocent man

innocent of this meditated

The Officer was called, and deposed that he happened to be at
Scotland Yard when the German prisoner called. Witness happened
to have a brown-paper parcel with him, which he gave to a little
girl to hold.
Mr. Warsaw. Are they in Court—I 'refer, of course, to the girl
and the parcel?
Inspector Van Laden. No, Sir.
Mr. Warsaw. Oh I I don't wish to introduce more witnesses
than necessary, but they had better be produced.
The Court adjourned accordingly for half-an-hour for that
purpose.
On its re-assemblin?, Mr. Wabsaw said: He did not propose
to produce either the girl or the brown-paper paroel at present, as
the circumstantial evidence of the latter and the verbal evidence of
the former had no immediate \earing on the case. He proposed to
ask the witness how he iden-
tified the paroel.

identify it by a portion of a

Wales's Feathers and the
motto "Ich dien."

Inspector Van Laden. "Ich

Mr. Warsaw. I dare say it

Witness. Yes; Sir. He said he had told him he wanted him to
help to advise him as to his "blowing the Gaff."
Mr. Warsaw. You see, your Worship, this effort to blow up the
Gaff—whatever that may be—opens our eyes to another attempted
explosion. This would therefore be a good time for adjournment.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOW IT REALLY CAME ABOUT.
Record of a Dialogue between an Illustrious Personage and an
Eminent Comedian, showing who suggested the Peerage for the
Laureate, also who made other Valuable Suggestions, and how
far they hare been acted upon. Now published for the first time.
It was after snpper, on a very great occasion towards the close of
the summer season of '83, when Mr. J. L. Toole, who had just finished
"Catching the Speaker's eye," to a piano accompaniment by a dis-
tinguished musician, was beckoned by H.R.H. to take a seat by his
side.
"You don't smoke, Mr. Toole ?" said H.R.H.
"No, Sir," replied the Comedian, "I strongly object to puffing
myself. But I don't in the least mind it in others—in fact, 1 rather
like it."
"Sorry Irving 'a going to America," observed H.R.H., watching
the smoke of his fragrant havannah as it gracefully curled upwards
in the direction of a distant ventilator.
The loyal Comedian could not but own that he also was deeply
grieved.
"You see," continued The Prince, "I wanted, and so did the
Princess, you and Irving to come down to Sandringham in the
winter and do Cox and Box with the music."
"I should be proud to represent the Musical Box on such an occa-
sion," said the witty Comedian.
"The fact is, I'd an idea which I should have liked to have seen
well carried out," H.R.H. went on.
"If it's a new piece, Sir, for my little place "the Comedian
began trembling with anxiety.
Ne. no, Mr. Toole; I don't go in for composition—I leave that
to and His Royal Highness nodded in the direction of the
adjoining room, whence proceeded the sweet strains of a violin.
Mr. J. L. Toole gave a smile; with him it was almost a wink of
intelligence, and bowed in his most courtly style, though, at the same
moment, it occurred to him that his centre stud had slipped from its
moorings, and descended towards his left boot. But he had been
accustomed to this sort of thing for some time in Artful Cards, and
he showed no outward sign of disturbance.
"My idea was," the Prince resumed, "that you and Irving
should do Cox and Box, re-written for the occasion by Alfred
Tennyson."
"Good; excellent; most excellent, Sir!" exclaimed the Comedian;
then added, with a profound obeisance, "You'll excuse me, Your
Royal Highness?"
Honest enthusiasm in the oanse of truth needs no apology,"
replied H.R.H., graciously, as he raised a glass to his hps, and
quaffed to the health of the Comedian, who, for one second, turned
aside, aad wiped away a glittering tear with his ooat-cuff. Human
nature is but human nature after all, and even a "Johnnie" is
only mortal. "I do not myself think the idea could well be im-
proved upon."
The Comedian coughed modestly. The Prince, ever on the alert,
saw that there was, as he was graciously pleased to express it,
"something in the wind."
"Not exactly that, Sir, but something in the windpipe,—if your
Royal Highness will pardon the explanation," said the Comedian as
he coughed again, and, at an intimation from the Prince, proceeded—
"I was about to suggest that Ici on Parle Francois would be better
adapted for the Laureate's style; and I venture to add that he will
find Ici quite as easy—ahem!—as Cox and Box for his purposes."
His Royal Highness was delighted. "The very thing!" the Prince
exclaimed. Then, after giving a few whispered instructions to Mr.
Fr-nc-8 Kn-ll-b, who, having received them, bowed and retired,
H.R.H. turned to the Comedian. "The fact is, there's been a
good deal in Knight-making lately,—we 're making a Knight of it
now, I suppose you woula say, Mr. Toole ?"—whereat, after a
paroxysm of laughter, the Comedian acknowledged that that was
indeed! his own idea, only infinitely better expressed by His Royal
Highness—" and so I thought that if it suited yourself and Irving,
as Heads of the two branches of the Theatrical Art-Profession, I
would propose that a Baronetcy should be conferred on each of you."
For one moment the Comedian was overcome; but the next,
Johnnie was himself again.
Bowing low, he replied, "Sir, I have no words to thank you for
the intended honour, which, though Henry—I mean Irving—might
accept, I must decline."
The Prince appeared disappointed.
"Now, look here, Sir, don't you know, I have made up my mind,"
the Comedian went on, standing in his celebrated oratorical attitude,
with one hand in his vest, his right knee bent, and his right arm
extended, "never to accept any title below a Duke's."
"Perhaps you are right," sighed the Prince, regretfully; then,
raising his voice, "But in a certain influential quarter there is a strong
wish to make a Peer of someone distinguished in the Drama, or
Literature."
"Take one man who represents them both, Sir," suggested the
Comedian, loftily.
"I don't quite understand you," said the Prince.
■ " Well, Sir,—you '11 excuse my glove," said Mr. J. L. Toole, as the
white kid on his right hand went crack, and he inwardly determined
never again to give eighteenpence a pair for his evening dress gloves,
—" but just now, Sir, you were proposing that Henry Irving and
myself should play in the Laureate s adaptation of 'Ici.'"—(The
Prince nodded assent.)—" Well, Sir, the Laureate hasn't come out
strong as a Dramatist, but he has done a Drama or two; and, as to
his position as a Poet"
"Cela va sans dire," acquiesced the Prince.
"Oh very much so, Sir. Yes—quite so—always," returned the
Comedian, with that perfect composure which has always been his cha-
racteristic on hearing a sentiment expressed in the French language;
"But, as I was saying, if you want Literature and Drama repre-
sented by one man, there he is!"
"True," replied the Prince, " and if it were only a Knighthood,"
—he paused—" but, you see, it's a Baron's coronet, and, it you and
Mr. Irving won't have it, then "And again His Royal High-
ness paused.
The Comedian, stretching out his right hand, and resuming his
oratorical attitude, well facing as it were his audience, took upthe
unfinished sentence, and exclaimed, in the words of Chawles, "Then
—' Give it to the Bard.""
The Prince rose, and shook the Comedian warmly by the hand.
"It shall be done," said His Royal Highness, "and, as for the
Dukedom"
"Don't mention it, Sir," the blushing Comedian murmured.
"I won't," responded the Prince, "and, anyhow, we shall see
you at Sandringham sometime in January; don't forget," and once
more warmly shaking the Comedian's hand, His Royal Highness
graciously quitted the apartment.
• •••••
Since the above dialogue took place, the Peerage of the Laureate
has been announced, and the visit of J. L. Toole to Sandringham
will have probably passed into the history of Accomplished Facts
ere this record appears,—the reason for preserving secresy having
ceased to exist about the same time as did Lord Coleridge's
reason for keeping his opinions on Ecclesiastical Law Reform to
himself,—and as to the Dukedom .... But we are not at liberty
to say any more on the subject.
"TOBY OR NOT TOBYI-THAT IS THE QUESTION,"-
Yes; that is the Question which hundreds of Correspondents
have put to us within the last fortnight, since the appearance of our
Index Number, when Mr. Punch was represented as accompanied,
not as heretofore by his ever faithful Toby, but by a Dachshund,
which is, sometimes, another name for a " Turnspit. Now, heaven
forefend that Toby should ever be of, so to speak, suoh a hewer-of-
wood-and-oarrier-of-water sort of breed as this name "Turnspit"
implies. Would Toby be a member of such a tribe to wnich
O'Connell's saying might be applied, that " where there was one of
his race to be roasted there was sure to be another ready to turn the
Siit"? Perish the thought! No: this Turnspit, this waddling
achshund, was not Toby, was not intended for Toby, was never
meant to be passed off on any one as Toby, and is in no way related
to Toby. Nor is he a "badger dog," another variety of Dachshund.
This is meant as an indignant denial and disclaimer on the part of
Toby himself, who, after his parliamentary duties, has been enjoying
his vacation, having thoroughly "laboured in his vocation, and
who, after some months' absence in foreign parts, may be even now
crossing the sea, in his own bark, homeward bound.
Why this Dachshund,—one Correspondent sent us a photo of a
thoroughbred Dachshund, and inferred that the supposed Toby was
not even well bred!!—this Dachshund in the Index Number was no
more like Toby than a Satyr (who had been a sitter for his portrait)
to Hyperion the Beautiful! Did he have a frill on? He had, cer-
tainly, a kind of a frill, and, as Mrs. Rahsbothax wrote to say, "A
frill of horror ran through me on seeingit" ;—but, good heavens!
does the Cowl make the Chimney-pot? Does the frill which some
very elderly gentlemen wear make them each individually and
respectively a Toby f Does the frill that appears beneath the
But we need proceed no further in this question of frills. Suffice it
for common-sense and our Correspondents that the frill no more
makes the Toby than the Toby makes the frill, or than Mr. Punch
makes his own dress-coat and opera-hat. We have spoken! Vire
Toby! Toby for Ever!!

THE BITTER CRY OF BUMBLEDOM.
"The Local Authorities have already large powers vested in them for
dealing with insanitary dwellings of the labouring classes, and the Board
desires to impress upon the Authorities the responsibility which consequently
attaches to them, and to urge them, by a vigorous exercise of the powers
with which they are intrusted, to secure an improvement of the dwellings."—
Local Government Board's Circular to the Vestries and District Hoards.
Bumble loquitur:—
Pouf! Nice pooty sort of a noosance! Wot next, I should like to
be told.
0 I know all this " Bitter Cry " bosh wich a gullible publio has sold,
Would make worry and work for the Westries before werry long.
There's no rest!
Some fools chivvies up a old hen most afore she is snug on her nest,
And then look for chiokings! Hugh Owen, I'm owin' you one, my
fine feller!
Expect snug dry cribs in a garret, and Rimmel's perfooms in a cellar.
Now don't you? Wot rubbige it is, all this muck about labourers'
dwellings!
Wheresomever the poor is there's bound to be breakages, dirt, and
bad smellings.
Poor thrives on 'em. Ask them as knows,—not your Parsons, and
scribblers, and Presidents,
As goes sniffin' round in the slums, to the jolly disgust of the
residents;
But proper Porochial parties, as knows that the labouring classes
Are half of 'em regular prigs, and the rest noisy Radical asses.
Us to blame P That's a capital notion! Drat them and their
"statutes" and " digests."
"Convenience of reference." Ah! that is one of their imperent sly
jests.
The Westries and Boards don't want woritting. Worrit is just my
abhorrence.
We know all about their fine Acts, whether cooked up by Cross or
by Torrens.
But to act upon Acts at full drive, as though we was mere waifs in a
Workus,
A-doing our bit on compulsion,—they might as well treadmill or
burke us!
Permissive they're all werry well, leaving us to be starters and
judges;
But puttin' the screw on like this is just making us porper-like
drudges.
Removal of Noosances? Yah! If we started on that lay, per-

SOME DIARIES OE 1881.
The Journalist.
January 1.—Got up at eight. Had breakfast at 8-30. Finished
papers by ten, and only smoked one cigarette. Wrote from ten till
one. Lunched off sandwich and glass of claret. Took constitutional
from two till five. Read evening papers. Dined quietly at Club at
6*30. Home at my Chambers at nine. Read steadily till 11*30.
During the evening drank two glasses of whiskey—very weak—and
smoked three pipes. The New Year has begun well.
June 1.—Got up at twelve. Didn't seem to care for any break-
fast, but had a couple of brandies-and-sodas. Papers looked unin-
teresting. Anyhow, didn't read them. Finished a box of cigarettes,
and went out to get more. Met a man who asked me to lunch:
lunched with him. Forget what we had to eat, but the magnum of
G. H. Mumm was magnumficent. Lunch over at four. Went down
Piccadilly. Had a split with a man in the 100th Hussars, at the
Naval and Military. St. James Street. Man asked me to dine and
go to Gaiety. Accepted. Called on man in the 30th Lancers at the
Rag. Stayed there talking, smoking, and drinking sherries-and-
bitters till 7'30. Somebody said there was nothing in the evening
papers, so didn't look at them. Home and dressed. Dined at 8'45.
Gaiety at ten. Lot of men I knew there. Big supper afterwards.
Home about half-past ten a.m. Remembered I ought to write article.
Concluded I wouldn't. Shall have to stop this. Caiera desunt.
Tee Schoolboy.
January 1.—Did not get up till 8-30. How pleasant after school.
Helped my sisters carding wool. Dusted some of Papa's books for
him. Worked at holiday task, in which I am well forward. Jimmy
Bates called, and wanted me to go out with him; but I wouldn't,
as I had promised Ma to go shopping with her. Only had two helps
of pudding at dinner. Papa promised me a new watch if I got my
remove at Midsummer. He says I shall have to work hard. Of
course I will.
June 1.—Late for breakfast, as I had sat up reading Pickwick in
bed with a dark lantern. Didn't know a word of my Casar, as I
thought I shouldn't be put on to construe, and I was. Caned in
Greek class. I wish Xenophon had never been born! A chap who
couldn't spell his own name, but did it with an " X" and thought it
wasa "Z"J Fool! Caned in Mathematics. Euclid's a beast. I'd
tell him so if I saw him. Fought M ills Senior before dinner, and got
two black eyes, but I made his nose bleed horrid. Papa came down in
afternoon, and asked what was the matter with my face? I told him
I had fallen down. He said 1 was a disgrace to the family, the school,
and myself. The Head-master said I should be soundly flogged the
next day. Papa said I riohly deserved it, and didn't tip me. I smoked
my new pipe in the evening, and Cartera desunt.
The Jockey.
_ January 1.—Maid a vow too giv 'up bettin and drinkin and not to
lissen to the vois of temptashun again, i hav had wun or 2 naro

Fame holding the symbol of eternity; below is Envy grasping the foot of the
hero and repelled by Truth."

fuss has been entirely forgotten I

THE SPEAKER.
(A Handbook to Ready-made Oratory.)
Part XI.—The British Army.
In proposing the toast of the Military the most conventional
[sentiments and phrases may be used. A few allusions to the
Peninsular War, Waterloo, the Crimea, and
Egypt, and a general expression of opinion
"that what has once been done can be done
again," will furnish the necessary materials
out of which may be manufactured a really
good effective "Service" speech. In like
manner the Warrior chosen to return thanks
has only to reply in the names of English
soldiers from the time of Alfred the Great
to the days of Victoria the Good, and promise
as many heroic things on their behalf as he
Eleases. It is not in the least necessary that
e should have been under fire, or ever seen
powder burned, save in the way of kindness—
at a review. _ As it is against etiquette to
wear medals in evening dress, his audience
will not know whether he is a feather-bed
soldier or a hardy veteran covered with battle-born scars. Still this
most satisfactory state of things cannot last much longer. The
tendenoy of the day is to reduoe everything to science, ana to elimi-
nate anything coarse or unfeeling. Under these circumstances, as
this Handbook is intended to be thoroughly practical, it will be as
well to give a couple of specimens of the alternative kind of speeohes
that will have to be delivered—the first for present use, the second
to be reserved for the days to come.
Specimen ATo. 1, Old Style. The Speech of the Past.
Military-looking Person {rising abruptly). Gentlemen, I thank
you. It has been a cause of great delight to me this day to know
that I would have to address you this evening. (N.B.—The Speaker
had been frightened into fits during the morning at the prospect of
having to open his lips before night.) But all I oan say is, that you
will agree with us that we have thoroughly done our duty in the past.
We do not mind starvation in a beleaguered fortress, or annihilation
by a savage foe. (N.B.—The Speaker has never professionally been
out of London or Windsor durtng his whole life.) And I suppose
when we next have to fight, we shall not forget the traditions of our
forefathers. (N.B.—The Speaker has only entered the Army to
have something to do until he comes into his inheritance, and has not
the smallest intention of going abroad upon active service.) So I
think I may say, "Ready, aye Ready !" "Rule, Britannia I" and
lastly, with confidence, "See the Conquering Heroes Come!"
\_The wildest enthusiasm, amidst which the Speaker resumes his
seat.
So much for the first kind of speech, which has been entirely
popular for hundreds of years. Until the changes, to which allusion
has already been made, are completed, this oration is perfectly satis-
factory, and may be used at any time with the utmost effect. And
now for the alternative:—
Specimen No. 2, New Style. The Speech of the Future.
Scientific-looking Person in Slue Spectacles {rising with diffidence).
Gentlemen, I thank you for your kindness, but apologise for my
nervousness. My profession disqualifies me for anything like pub-
licity or criticism—(" Hear, hear ! ")—as you all know I, in common
with the rest of my brother Officers, am a recluse. I prefer the
odour of midnight oil to the perfume of gunpowder. {Cheers.) I
need scarcely remind you that, nowadays, we have no bloodshed.
All our fighting is done on paper^and such a thing as an angry word
is entirely obsolete. (Cheersi) When we know, as a mathematical
certainty, that a given number of rifles and cannons and ammuni-
tion, with men benind them, must beat a force so large or so small,
what can be the use of fighting the matter out? It would be sad
waste—(cheers)—so we get a little "rusty "—(*' No, no.'")—to use
an expression once much in fashion with those barbarians the
"warriors" of the past. (Groans.) In conclusion, let me again
thank you for proposing the health of a body of men who, unac-
quainted, as they are with the old-fashioned cruelties of Military
fife, are yet the saviours of the people. (Great enthusiasm.) War,
nowadays, thanks to the march of progress, is quite as interesting
as a game of ohess, and not half as dangerous. So, Gentlemen, I thank
you for the compliment you have paid the Army. [Loud applause.
So much for the past and the future of the British Soldier! Should
Science lag a little behind, and lead and steel remain the handmaids
of war, the first specimen will be still available. But come what
come may, the English Army will be always equal to the emergency.
A sentiment whion may be worked into any Service speech after
9 p.m., with advantage.

THE LATEST CRAZE.
(Letters from a young Gentleman of Fashion wlio "Adopted the Stage as
a Profession.")
My dear Duchess, 28> Shrimp Street, Shellford.
Rather a painful thing has happened since I last wrote.
Poor Mr. Garrick is leaving us. I can't get at the exact story, but I
believe it was his birthday the other day, and he thought he would like
to see himself act, so he went in front to watch himself "come on
the stage." I never heard of a similar case; but Miss Poster says
she cair t allow her company to labour under the impression that they
can watch themselves act, although we have very many quick changes;
so she has given poor Mr. Garrick a fortnight's notice. "Given a
fortnight's notice!" It sounds like a footman; but I believe they
get a month's notice. Of course business must be mixed up some-
how with Art when you take to it as a profession. Still, however, I
shall get accustomed to all this sort of thing, only one is a bit desiltu-
sione now and then. You know I get accustomed and attached to
the people around me, and although I can't approve of all Mr. Gar-
rick does, his going will be a wrench for me. He doesn't seem to
care about his home; and he doesn't appear certain about his wife
caring to have him back, poor fellow!
The Theatre is going on like a great mill grinding out plays, at
wholesale prioes. We can't do real justice to the works we are given
to deal with, but we all try our best. We are going on a tour of ail
the towns in the South soon. I often tried to give you an idea of the
country-Actor at home, but I'm afraid I can't. His patois is too
ditfioult to transcribe. There are some beautiful lines of Keats's,
which I forget now, but they tell you what sort of a thing it is.
It is so funny, that every one or the Company seems overwhelmed
with misery and sickness and domestic sorrow, and the smallest coins
seem of use to quell all the wretchedness. They call pennies "D's."
They are always going " odd man out" with me "for three outs " of
peppermint. I don't yet know what an "out" is, and don't want
to, as I detest the smell of peppermint, as much as I remember of it
in lozenges at school. I hope you won't be bored, my dear Duchess,
by my mentioning these trifles, but you are kind enough to take an
interest in my doings, and you asked me to tell you "all about it."
Well, "all" must include peppermint even in Art. and it seems to
me that a theatrical proverb for our company might be, "It's a poor
Art that never rejoices " in peppermint; but I've always got to pay
4 D, and so I keep a shillings worth of coppers handy in my pocket.
But I admit all this is very tiresome; here am I an earnest student
of what I consider a grand Art, requiring all one's education and atten-
tion, and I am hampered at every turn with stories of woes, "Dsj"
odd and vulgar expressions, nasty drinks, and electrical changes in
our programme, that at times I'm almost for giving it up, and going
back to a clerkship in a good office, if I can get it now. It is so diffi-
cult to fix one's attention. We rehearse most days from ten to one;
but then there is never more than one book, and everybody comes
with such piteous tales. I really mix up the private conversation with
the piece, and it takes some time to calm down and sort one's ideas
afterwards. It really is hard that all these outside influences should
be brought to bear on one, and prevent quiet study.
Now, Mr. Snow has no right to harrow me about his mother
when I'm studying Count Basset in the Provoked Husband. The
Stage Managers careworn face always reminds me of twenty letters
I've promised to write to people interested in the Blue-Coat School.
Miss Lamsphrie (our leading Lady) out of her salary is burying some
of her relatives. We are subscribing to help her. Actors of any
grade are good, tender-hearted, open-handed people—specially when
there's anything to put into the open hands. But what I mean is
they 're kind and generous, even when to be generous means (as it
does here) self-deprivation. Miss Poster says she '11 go as far as
one-and-sixpence, and Mr. Snow has given 2 D; but that won't pay
for much.
Somehow it's all very—very—weU, very unlike anything I could
possibly have imagined the Stage, as a Profession, to have been,
judging from the two or three representatives of the Art whom I
used to meet occasionally at your house. I can't help thinking that
the very greatest of them, even when he rises to the eminence of an
Irving, must often say to the reflection of himself in the glass, when
he's made up for some part or other night after night, " 0 dear, what
a fool you are I" I do: but then—well, a friend might retort
unkindly,—so, au revoir.' Yours, H. ra B***.
"On, my dear," said Mrs. Ramsbotham to her married niece
Angelica with whom she is keeping Christmas, "while you were
out the Turkeycock called for a Christmas-box, and I gave him five
shillings. Was I right '<" [Angelica was puzzled at first. It was
the Turncock.]

A LONDON COW.
{Metropolitan Idyl.)
[The cream had been extracted and the milk adulterated with
50 per cent, of water. The only remedy for such a state of
things appear* to be, as the law stands, that the London con-
sumer must keep his own cow.—Social Axiom.]
"Dear Great-grand-uncle, tell me why
You look so haggard, pinched, and ill?
The Dairy Company hard hy
Supplies your daily gallon still:
The milk comes from a Country Cow.
Tou should have gained some flesh ere now."
So chirped the child. The old man sighed,
And feebly shook his aged head.
"I take one gallon," he replied,
"Yet two would see me poorly fed.
I know not why it is, or how,
But I mistrust that Country Cow!"
Then spake that little child again,—
"Dear Qreat-grand-unole, do not doubt!
The milk arrives each day by train—
In trimmest carts 'tis borne about;
The drivers wear clean smocks! Ah, how
Can you see this—yet doubt the Cow?"
"I doubt it," moaned the aged man,
"Because I never able seem
To skim from off my gallon can
One single thimbleful of cream!
You surely do not wonder now
Why I suspect that Country Cow?"
Then did that little child reflect.
Quoth he, "If you no more are plump,
Dear Great-grano-uncle, I expect
You suffer through some local pump.
A local pump-^I've read—ere now
Has brought discredit on a Cow.
"For water, poisoned water too,
Than milk is cheaper far, they say,
And men who honest trade pursue,
Will poison gaily—if it pay.
The kindly laws such things allow.
I point this out—to clear the Cow!
",The milk that she would yield to you
Is rich in cream ;—yet, brought to town,
By knavish hands it passes through,
Alas! is surely watered down!
The first such fraud to disavow
Would be that most indignant Cow I"
The old man sighed a deeper sigh,
And glanced upon his gallon can.
"I feel," he whispered, I must die,
Unless I shelve the middle man!
You '11 say 'get rid of him,'—but how?"
Rejoined that child, "Why—start a Cow!"
• • * * •
The deed was done! The coast was cleared,
The farmer, middle-man,—the pump
At one fell swoop all disappeared.
The fattened Sage had played his trump!
He's twenty stone,—and over, now; —
And owes it to a London Cow!
That eccentric body, the Municipal Council of Paris,
proposes altering the name of the Rue Victoria to the Rue
O'Donnell. This is sympathy with a vengeance. Of
"Victoria" in its literal sense Frenchmen have, it must
be confessed, had but little experience of late years,
hence the change may be wise. But let them pause ere
they adopt " 0 Donnell." There was a famous Spanish
O'Donnell, and the Paris Muncipality should be like
Cesar's wife, especially where Spain is concerned. Com-
pliments are not exactly the greetings that Paris should
send to Madrid, until Alphonso ceases to be a Uhlan.

THE DROMORE DROMIOS.
The Loyalist C^sar and the Nationalist Pomi-ey seem "very much alike,"
indeed—in the matter of noisy mischief. If we add " especially the Loyalist
Cssar," it is simply because upon his own showing, he ought to know better.
He poses as champion of law and order. What does he consider himself "loyal"
to? Authority? Well, owing largely to his unauthorised and unruly action,
Authority has to " take ample precautions to preserve the peace," such precautions
including the drafting into Dromore of more than one thousand soldiers and
police, in addition to stationing detachments of Infantry, Cavalry, and Police at
various points in the county, to prevent the Orangemen and Nationalists from
coming into collision! And after all "the efforts of the troops and the liberal
use of the bayonet could not keep the Orangemen from attacking the Nationalists,"
the result being a disgraceful Donnybrook melee of stick-wielding, stone-throw-
ing, and stabbing. Nice commentary on Loyalist claims to Championship of Law
and Order! Law and Order may well say Save us from our friends!
The windy ravings of the Loyalist speakers show only too plainly that not
love of anything (save perhaps shindy), but hatred of their countrymen of the
opposite camp moves them most strongly. Their speech bewrayeth them. The
cloven hoof of partisan fury peeps out of every paragraph. The pity of it!
Loyalty is not so plentiful in the Distressful Country that one can without grave
regret see it spoiled by spite, and made mischievous instead of helpful, by law-
affronting violence. One feels that the Orange champions would not hate "dis-
loyalty" so much, did they not hate their "Green fellow-countrymen more.
Here is no sound basis for loyalty; or, rather, it is a basis which is all " sound"
—and fury, signifying nothing but noisy aggravation of difficulties already
sufficiently formidable. Each of the Dromore J)romios yearns for that hateful
and hate-engendering thing, "Ascendency." One seeks it through seditious
violence. Does the other hope to g^iin it by counter-violence in the name of
"loyalty "? If so, let him lay this plain rule of good citizenship to heart:—
The surest way to defend the Law is—to obey it!
Sung with more sorrow than enthusiasm, at Monifrith, the other day—" But

THE MODERN ARS AMANDI,
(By Punchius Ifaso.)
CANTO VII.—Love, the Mime.
Did Punch indeed his oracle set up
Beneath his cedar (Psyche, pass the cup!)

How would the fair Hock hither from May fair
And rural Hole-cum-Corner! QueTy, prayer,
Whisper, and wail, shy hint, and blushful plaint,
From blameless sinner or from saucy saint,
Secrets should tell, such as Dodona's oak
Heard never. For the youngling Archer's yoke
All necks would bow to, whilst all hearts would fain
In double-harness drag his rose-wreathed wain.
"Please, may I flirt f" The silvery whisper slips
Softly, from many a pair of pouting lips,
In Punch's ready ear. The genial sage
Is no Draconic dragon. War to wage
A outrance against all the trips and twirls
Of vagrant fanoy in our boys and girls,
Those semi-tender tentatives of hearts.
Mild mock-rehearsals of the sweets and smarts
Of full-played Passion, were not wiser fun
Than stalking midges with an Armstrong gun.
"Hooray!" shouts Flo. "Let solemn seniors ohide,
And prudes cry ' shocking!' Punch is on our side."
Free-phrased and frolic Mischief, not too fast!
Could such siv net as venomed Vulcan cast
O'er flagrant Venus and hot-chafing Mars
Snare some bare hearts, what stains, what sanguine scars,
Born of the Love-burlesques light souls find sweet,
The Olympian leisurely regard might greet!
Stains f Spirit-stains, gay sprite, though like the dye
Of long-shed blood, safe-hidden from the eye,
Are blazoned to the conscience. Lethal hurt
All variations of the verb "to flirt"—
Circean vocable !—may not impart
To worldly " honour" or to modish " heart."
"Such splendid practice!" sparkling Clem a cries,
With a consummate flash of conscious eyes
Which, trained in mirrored manifold reflection,
Are calculable as a conic section.
Well, to submit to calmly cold analysis,
True coquetry might bring a strange paralysis
On mobile Maidenhood. To test her arms,
Parade and prove her panoply of charms,
Essay, rehearse effects of clasp and glance,
The blood 's warm bounds the pulses maddening dance,
Hint adoration by a radiant lilt
Of swimming eyes whose movements slow or swift
Are deftly measured; flash affected scorn
Or flush a well-feigned shyness, ape forlorn
Lone .Ariadne's lingering long regard,
Or Sappho's brooding yearning, raise unbarred
Twin heavens of amorous and irradiant blue,
Prove what soft fingers, what sweet breath can do
By furtive pressure or by fragTant waft;
Try every flight and pitch of the toy shaft
Of'Love the Mime; all this—in girlish phrase—
"Comes natural" to the maid of modern days
As to love-cunning Ceessida of old.
Playing at Love! A pleasant game, we 're told
By—well, by those whom conscious shame holds not
To a wise silence covering scar or blot.
Play, if you please, brisk Beauties, who care less
For stainless scutcheon than assured success.
White is a trying tint to keep quite clear
From smirch; a decent grey makes easier wear.
Play, if you please! In tender conscience wakes
Scorn of the game, or horror of the stakes;
But cheery callousness is the " good form
Of boudoir as of Club-room. Tea-cup storm
Of prickly prudishness will little move
The votaries of that pleasant Cult, Mock-Love.
Mock-Love! And what if that, and that alone,
It be that, after all, hath ever known
The rules of Art? What, if attempts to teach
Charm to the rose or sweetness to the peach,
To instruct the wanton woodbine how to cling,
Or the shy violet to bewitch the Spring,
Were all as wise and fruitful as to aim
At teaching love as experts teach a game?
What if the real Eros laughed at rule
And, though an urchin, scorned attending school
(No pupil, but the universal master)
What if Dame Nature fairer teach and faster
All honest love-lore than erotic bard,
Sage erudite or matron keen and hard?
What if mere coded artifice were all
That Ovid or "Mamma" might fairly call
An Ars Amandi, dealing with mock passion
Inspired by sensuousness and shaped by fashion?
Hear the Boy, wise with all the lore of age,!
To Pcnchius, youthful yet though thrice a Sage.
Young Age, old Youth! A dual marvel rare
That deathless, fitly matched and matchless pair.
Love to his Laureate.
]fagister Artium! Love is " Art of Arts,"
But 'tis "an Art which Nature makes. As she,
The Protean Thaumaturge, playB myriad parts
Through multitudinous mutability,
Unchanged in essence.
So through Art's maskings ana quaint mimicry
Lives Love's perennial presence.
By law cloud pageantries take form and fleet,
By rule June's lavish leafery, wind-stirred, shakes.
Untracked, untraceable as fairy feet
O'er flowers, or siren dances on dim lakes,
But ever shaping.
So the pure spirit of Love, like Ariel, takes
Innumerous tricksy draping.
Teaoh on, elected Laureate! Lesson still
In blameless Art not disavowed by me,
Rebel to rule, yet owning sleight and skill
To frank heart-impulse fair auxiliary.
Sham priests insult us
With Bacchic rites. Frolic and gentle glee
Grace the true Cyprian cultus.
Mock-Love hath its own ritual, and a code
As hollow as itself. The callous sham
Of Marriage-Marts, the Mamad brazen-browed
Of female Action, each may coach and cram
In her own fashion.
For the two branches of their base " exam.,"
Cold greed and sensual passion.
Let Love the Mime absolve them, if he may,
Of falseness and disfame. I know them not.
But venial preludings of hearts o'er gay,
The sweet burlesques that scarcely sting or blot,
Shall I be hard on?
Sham skirmishes ere yet his shaft is shot
Cupid can lightly pardon.
Play at, but not with Love! A rule to take
Cum grano. No austere precisian, I,
But when the game is for the nobler stake,
To win it not by tricks but honours try,
Bright British Maiden!
The burthen with whose mild morality
This Ars Amandi's laden!

loops of his "sus-

The aged Axe-wielder
penders," turned up the peaks of his
outer garments.
At that moment a man was observed crouching behind [a huge
trunk, which the Veteran Woodman had lately felled. To pounce
upon him, drag him to his feet, and, with a violent shake, dislodge
from his person a mysterious oblong parcel, was the work of one
moment, and seven Detectives.
"What is it?" asked the Woodman, arrested in his al fresco
toilette by this sudden scuffle.
"One of em, I suspex, Sir," responded the Detective, obscurely,
but respectfully; lifting and handling gingerly the dropped parcel.
"Nothing of the sort!" ejaculated the Prisoner, with gurgling
indignation. "I'm Ssiiwins!!!"
The last words seemed to have a remarkable effect upon the
venerable master of State-and-Wood-craft. He started; a slight
roseate flush seemed to suffuse his pale and many-furrowed cheeks,
like Aurora's glow on trenched snow. He looked, hesitatingly, this
way, and that. He felt, with his thumb, the edge of the axe. He
glanced meditatively at the fallen trunk, and thence at the self-
proclaimed Smiwiws. He might have stood for the picture of an
embarrassed headsman. Could he possibly meditate? but no. He
leaned upon his axe, and motioned the intruder to approach him.
"For 'evin'a sake be careful, Sir!" ejaculated the Detective.
"This 'ere parcel—yarh!"
The expression thus phonetically approximated was caused by the
Woodman coolly taking the parcel from his hesitating grasp, and
quietly depositing it in his capacious hat. Then, with a genial and
interested smile on his vigorous and venerable countenance, he
deliberately took the much-relieved Smiwins aside, and with him
entered into an animated, but, to the Detectives, inaudible conver-
sation.
They had talked for an hour. All that the straining ears of the
Detectives could catch was an eager " Sevenpence," and a muttered
sound which seemed like " Sugar." Then another figure appeared
hastily on the scene, and swiftly approached the absorbed inter-
locutors.
"Well, Herbert," said the Woodman, cheerily, "as you didn't
turn up, I brought it down alone. If Salisbury goes down as
easily! Then he took what seemed an affectionate farewell of the
smiling SiriwrNS, slung his axe over his shoulder, hooked his arm
in that of his son, and quietly walked off toward the Castle.
"Well I'm blowed!" ejaculated the seven Detectives simul-
taneously, following respectfully, but watchfully, in the rear.
"Any thing happened in Ireland ?— gone wrong in Egypt?—turned
up in the Transvaal?" queried Herbert, anxiously.
"Not that I know of, Herbert," responded the old Woodman,
placidly. "Why do you ask?"
"Oh—why—nothing—only Buggins yonder came hurriedly to me,
and said there was a mysterious party 'anging about, after no good,
he was sure."
"Nonsense!" responded the Premter, pleasantly. "They are
so fidgety. I shall remonstrate with Habcourt, and"
"But," interrupted his companion, "Bdggins said something
about a mysterious parcel, which looked suspiciously like a canister
of"
The merry laugh of the Axe-wielder cut him short, "Why,
Herhert," he said, "you know the Audit Dinner is held to-
morrow, and I am posting myself in a few pertinent facts. As to
the parcel—look!"
He extricated it with some difficulty from his well-worn hat, and,
stripping off its paper wrappage, presented it to his son. On a red
label, in black letters, it bore the following inscription:—
BEST RASPBERRY JAM.
SMIWINS & CO.,

A NOVEL IDEA.
Thacbtebay had the profoundest faith in Doctor Brighton as a
curer of all ills, bodily and mental. It would appear that that
belief exists in the present day, if we may judge from the following,
that lately appeared in the Daily Telegraph:—
LADY, having seen much domestic trouble, and finding the world
cold and hard, wishes to meet with someone of an amiable, sympathetic
nature, similarly circumstanced, to join her in email house at Brighton.
Let us hope this good Lady will meet with the friendship and
sympathy she desires. But we very much doubt whether she will find
the world less "cold and hard in a "small house at Brighton"
than anywhere else.
"Prawns and PoiiMERY"at the Comedy Theatre sounds more
aristocratic than " Shrimps and Tea." We seldom get a chance of
seeing first pieces, but it must be a dull audience that cannot soon
reduce the Prawns " to head and tail; and as for the Pommery, that
of course must be a highly Pop-ular form of entertainment.

So London Dons, methinks, will steal

MEETING IT WITH SPIRIT.
The Psychical Representative and Aged Ghosts Sustentation Fund
Society held their annual meeting at the Adelphi Shades yesterday
evening. It having been pretty well known beforehand that the
Bishop of Carlisle 8 recent article in the Contemporary would lead
to some spirited discussion, the room was already inconveniently
crowded at a comparatively early hour, several distinguished
spectres who could not possibly alter their arrangements and put in
an appearance before the traditional stroke of twelve, being shut out
altogether and unable in consequence^to take any part in the pro-
ceedings.
On midnight sounding from the steeple of a neighbouring church,
the Ghost of Hamlet's Father was by unanimous consent voted into
the Chair. On rising, he said, that he thought he need not dwell on
the cause that had brought them together, some of them too a long
distance, and at much personal inconvenience. (A sepulchral voice,
"I believe you, Governor.'")—It was generally understood by all
of them. He referred to a ribald article that had lately appeared rn an
influential Review (" Hear, hear.'") He had not perused that
article himself, for the simple reason that, like that very large and
influential class who were interested in apparitions, he could not
read. (Roars of laughter.) Still he had made a very good Ghost for
all that. He always, without any regard to the discomfort, appeared
in armour—("Hear, hear.'")—and he felt a personal interest in
opposing any rubbishing new-fangled scientific theory which could
possibly account for his general get-up. But he left the discussion
in abler hands than his. (" No.' no.'") He would only add that he
should uncommonly like to hear a good high-class family Ghost give
his views on the subject. (Prolonged hollow cheers, and loud cries
for the " Little Blue Man.")
The next speaker, who rose amidst a perfect storm of mysterious
ghostly applause, and wore a faded blue coat and a full-bottomed
wig of the last century, said he belonged to an old Wiltshire Manor
House—(" Hear.'")—and was generally known in the neighbourhood
as " The Little Blue Man." (Cheers.) He needn't tell them what
he had done when he was alive—(" No, no.'")—but he has always
found himself hanging about the premises with a pained expression,
and, whether he liked it or not, making a noise on an upper landing
as if he was playing at football by himself with a large leathern
trunk. (Laughter.) What had the Bishop of Carlisle to say to
that? (Cheers.)
The Beresford Ghost here rose, and said that he considered a mere
family Ghost of that sort that was always appearing, without any
point, to everyone, brought discredit on the whole class. (" Hear,
hear.'") He had on one occasion, but on one occasion only, fright-
ened a near relative into fits. (Laughter.) That was the true busi-
ness of a genuine apparition. Continual shrieking and tumbling
all over the place was vulgar. (" Hear, hear.'")
The Ejected Berkeley Square Spectre wished to ask the last speaker
what a Ghost was to do with himself when he could not keep quiet?
He had caused a house to be pulled down by his own behaviour, and
he much regretted it, as he now should feel bound to haunt the mere
site, without having the fun. He believed there was to be a pillar-
post erected on the spot. (" Oh, oh.'") He asked how he could
comfortably get into that, and frighten people who came with their
letters after twelve? Yet he supposed he should have to do it.
(Groans.)
A deceased Scotch Nobleman, who had worried all his descendants
for five centuries by gliding about a sentry-box on Christmas Eye,
said nothing was easier. He generally appeared as a large black
hound with red fiery eyes, and found it most effective. (" Hear,

hear!") Nobody exactly knew what it meant. And, for the
matter of that, he hadn't the least idea himself. (Loud laughter.)
Still, he would like to try it on the Bishop of Carlisle. In conclu-
sion, he would strongly recommend his Berkeley Square friend to
attempt something of the sort at the corner of Mount Street. With
judgment, especially on a dark windy night, he would probably clear
the whole place in a few minutes. (Loud cheers.)
A highly respectable walking apparition who gave as his address a
well-known noble mansion in one of the Midland Counties, said he
deprecated the introduction of any mere tomfoolery into the sober and
serious business of immaterial irresponsibility. ("Hear, hear."')
Ghosts, as a class, had greatly suffered from the recent extravagances
of Modern Spiritualism. Take his own case. For thirteen generations
he had been in the habit of taking a quiet midnight stroll along a
picture gallery, accompanied by the clanking of iron chains, and the
sound of a trooper's horse tumbling down a back staircase. (Cheers.)
He never touched a banjo or flung boots and odd bits of furniture
about, though he had been strongly advised to show a little of that
kind of thing, and march with the times. (" Oh, oh."') He was of
opinion that the best way to meet the worthy Bishop was to keep
steadily to their old haunts and frighten him when they got a chance,
but refuse absolutely to come on to the platform in answer to any
scientific challenge whatever. (Enthusiastic cheering.)
At this point of the proceedings a recently-departed spirit of excel-
lent antecedents, was about to explain to the assembly the possibility
of " marching with the times " by permanently haunting a Hammer-
smith omnibus, when, it was suddenly announced to the Chairman
that Mr. Labouchere was endeavouring to enter the Hall, and had
already presented his card to the skeleton in charge of the hats and
umbrellas. The blue fire was thereupon quickly turned out, and the
Meeting, with a departing wail of thanks to the Chairman, adjourned,
by general consent, to All Hallows' E'en in the present year.
The Right Name, after all.—In a curious dispute in the jewel-
lery trade, which was recently argued at considerable length in the
Lord Mayor's Court, there was some difference of opinion as to what
sham sapphires should be called. Why not call them Sapphiras?

monument erected in memoriam to Nelson. It is, as you must be
aware, a charge under the Vagrant Act, and I am bound to admit, it

You have made no attempt

begged of him to accept his (defendant's) sincere apology.
Mr. Warn (the learned Magistrate, addressing the Defendant,
with extreme dignity and severity). It seems to me deeply to be

THE NOTE-BOOK OF A DETECTIVE JOURNALIST/
I Unravel the Egyptian Question, Disguised as the Duke of
Cambridge.
Received letter from my Editor. "You must find out what they
are doing- at the Horse Guards at this crisis. Why not go as an old
Indian Officer?"
I smiled at the simplicity of the suggestion, and gave a few neces-
sary orders to my assistant. Then, of course, I went to Covent
Garden to be "made up."
"What is it this time, Sir?" asked the Theatrical Hairdresser,
getting his various pigments into order, and offering me a chair.
"The Duke of Cambridge," I replied, without hesitation.
"Get me down the Bouncer wig out of Cox and Box, and bring it
here directly," cried the intelligent tradesman, and in a trice my
head disappeared into a rather bald peruke, while my cheeks and
upper lip became decorated with grey crape-hair. Then I was join-
ing-pasted, powdered, and rouged.
I think that will do. Sir," said Mr. Wolf, handing me a small
glass. "I have not reddened the nose, as I presume your reading of
the part is rather serious than comic."
"Certainly," I returned. "At so great a crisis as the present—
when, at a moment's notice, we might be pledged to a second Egyptian
campaign—it would be highly indecorous to be funny. You were
quite right to leave the nose uncoloured."
Mr. Wolf seemed much gratified at my approbation, and bowed
me out of the shop. Of course, my next visit was to a well-known
costumier in Bow Street. On explaining my views, he immediately
returned, "that he had the very thing I wanted," and produced
what seemed to be the highly-spangled undress uniform of a Tartar
Admiral.
"No, Mr. June," I said kindly, but firmly; "that will not do.
The Duke of Cambrtdoe is most particular about details."
"Well, there you are!" cried Mr. June, falling back and exa-
mining the costume with an expression of extremely well simulated
admiration—" there you are! His Royal Highness, no doubt, is
Honorary Colonel of many foreign regiments, why not of this? I
am doing you a great favour in letting you have it, as 1 had intended
to send it down to a Gentleman in the country, who is very particular
about his get-up, who is to play to-night, in some amateur theatri-
cals, the part of the Captain in Good for Nothing."
"It won't do, Mr. June," I replied, firmly; and after some further
conversation was at length suited with a uniform of a nondescript
character, which had the debatable advantage of representing in its
details all branohes of the Military Service—Regulars, Militia, Yeo-
manry, and Volunteers. It, however, was the best that the establish-
ment could produce.
"If the Commander-in-Chief can't wear what he pleases,"
remarked Mr. Juke, "I should like to know who can?"
"You are sure that all the Orders are right?" I asked.
"Quite sure," returned Mr. June. "They all belongto the first
dress of Mazeppa except that star, which I took from a Hamlet."
Stepping into the gold coach which had come round in obedience
to the instructions of my assistant, I rapidly drove to the Horse
Guards in Pall Mall. I alighted, and the two sentries on guard over
the areas immediately presented arms. To keep up my military
character, I inspected them closely; and then, prompted by a recol-
lection of many years ago, of a month's service as a subaltern in the
Militia, asked one of them " to give over his orders." He replied,
without hesitation,
"Take charge of all Government property in view of my box,
salute the Dook, alarm the guard in case of fire, and not to let no
dogs pass through that there door."
Satisfied with this reply. I entered the office, and was received with
that earnest respect which every; respectable Englishman yields to
Royalty. My uniform was accepted as a matter of course. Had I
walked in on all-fours I do not believe that the proceeding would
have provoked criticism—at any rate, publicly expressed. I was
ushered into a palatial apartment.
"■Your Royal Highness was not expected," said a bowing Mes-
senger, who yet spoke with a slight tremor; "so none of your Royal
Highness's Staff are here."
It does not in the least matter," I returned, sweetly, as I
remembered that the leading characteristics of the Duke of Cam-
bridge were extreme gentleness and long-suffering.
"Your Royal Highness will observe," continued the bowing Mes-
senger, '' that a telephone has been put up. Has your Royal Highness
any message for the Secretary of State? His Lordship is on the point
of leaving the office for Downing Street to attend a Cabinet Council."
• "At Marlborough Street Police-Court, Hugh M'Lachlan, address refused,
was charged, as a suspected person, with loitering in Hanover Square. The
Prisoner, when asked what he had to say, stated that he was a Journalist,
and was going to write an article, on the profits of beggars, in the Echo ....
He went out attired as a beggar for the purpose of gaining information."—
The Timet, January 9th, 18S4.
js" You can tell the Marquis that I entirely disagree with his pro-
posals of yesterday," I answered, recollecting that it is a tradition
for the Commander-in-Chief always to be at loggerheads with the
Civil Director of the Army. The Messenger returned almost imme-
diately.
"The Marquis sends his most respectful compliments to your Royal
Highness," said the man. "and is gratified beyond measure that
your Royal Highness should object to all his Lordship's proposals of
yesterday. The Marquis adds that he has entirely forgotten what
his proposals were, but that it is all right."
The Messenger then withdrew, and left me alone in the room. I
looked round the apartment In a corner there was an enormous
bundle of red tape. On tables were placed, in rows, specimens of
coat-buttons. There were luxurious arm-chairs, sofas, and lounges,
and on the writing-desk a large empty basket, labelled " Intelligence
Department." Beside this gaping receptacle were several pamphlets,
of which the following were some of the titles: — How to obtain
Recruits from Prisons, Reformatories, and Broadmoor; Why wear
Grey when Waterloo was won in Scarlet; and Scheme for putting a
Battalion of Infantry on a War-Footing in times of emergency by
drafting Recruits into itfrom the Royal Horse Guards, the Fkld
Artillery, the Gordon Highlanders, the Malta Fencibles, and the
Yorkshire Yeomanry. I had scarcely time to notice this, before
an electric-bell called me to the telephone. I applied my ear to .the
receiver, and being asked "who I was," answered, with some inward
compunotion, "The Duke of Cambridge."
"Exactly so," said the voice through the telephone. "I am Mr.
Gladstone."
"Really," I replied, forgetting for a moment my assumed charac-
ter, "it is a great honour to me to have the distinction of speaking
to so eminent a Statesman."
"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed Mr. Gladstone through the telephone.
"Your Royal Highness never will be serious! But now we must
beg you to give your attention to us. We have a most difficult
question in connection with a campaign in Egypt."
This was most interesting! I prepared my Note-Book, and waited
for what Mr. Gladstone had next to say.
(To be continued.)
ST. GEOEGE AND THE DRAGON.
The new St. George has appeared—at St. James's. The Dragon
which he purposes to attack, rout, and utterly demolish is the Dragon
of Poverty.
"Property is theft," opined Proudhon, and St. George is appa-
rently oil the same way of thinking. All holders of land, it would
appear, have stolen it. From whom? From that useful generali-
sation, but peculiarly vague entity, "The People." St. George
would steal it back again—" resume " the wise it call. After that,
Utopia and universal happiness, of course!
What melancholy moonshine it all is! The Dragon of Poverty is
so dismal a reality, that it is sad to find its self-appointed would-be
slayer a sham—or worse. St. George is probably as well meaning in
his wild onset as was Don Quixote when he assailed the windmills
or the sheep. An honest advocate of universal dishonesty is none
the less a pitiable spectacle.
"There is more than enough for all," declares St. George. Why,
certainly. Why, then, should "all" not have more than enough?
The fault obviously must rest with those who have secured super-
fluity. Steal—no, "resume"—that superfluity, distribute it, so
that the luckless lack-alls get their full share, and you'll nave
"more than enough" all round—until these troublesome laws of
Nature and human character which so obstinately decline to be
"averaged," or argued out of existence, resume their indisputable
sway. Then, of course, you must start again.
It is to be feared that the poor of the land will not derive much
more practical good from George the Fifth," as wary Mr.
Labouchere non-committally called him, than from the other four
THACKERAY-bethumped monarchs. It is a pity, because the Dragon
of Poverty is no pasteboard property monster: and what are called
the "Rights of Property "do, in many cases, involve the foulest
and most far-reaching of wrongs. But the practice of Robin Hood
is no cure for the theory of Rob Rot. "You can by this one thing abo-
lish poverty," confidently asserts Mr. George: '' here is a right." But
if " this one thing" is wholesale robbery (and expropriation without
compensation means and must involve that), it is to be feared—nay,
rather to be hoped—that the honest people of England will not con-
sent to the abolition of poverty on any such deadly and disgraceful
terms.
Apropos of a Case last Week.—What to do with a Housemaid
who discharges a revolver? Evidently—discharge her.

Well, John, how now? A jibbing English nog
Were easier driving than your present cattle.
You have not made much headway, seem to lag,
Although you started with a regular rattle.
You 're in the East, John,
And dealing with a strange and ticklish beast, John.

But you should get the brute—'twere only right—
Beyond a sluggish intermittent waddle.

Poor " Beast of Burden!" For so very long
O'erladen, overdriven, 'tis a wonder

Abides the brutal thong, the tyrant blunder,
And stands survivor
Of many a leader rash and ruthless driver.
The latest leader you, relieved at last
From hampering rivalry and awkward trammel,

Or get on Karev terms with that same camel.

Your strivings to combine extreme humanity
With tolerable progress. Will you win
With line punctilio and strict urbanity,

Who'd smile between the hammer and the anvil?
Mossoo thinks not. "Mon ami Jean," cries he,
(And in his eyes there's a satiric twinkle),
"If you can't lead that stubborn brute—let Me.'"
But John, an oriental Mr. Winkle
Is not precisely
The sort of part in which you'd figure nicely.
The Camel's rider looks a lumpish log,
With an uncertain seat that courts disaster.
He '11 hardly help you make the creature jog.
Is he, or you, or neither to be master
Of rein or tether?
The question's urgent. Pull yourself together!
John Bull loquitu)—
I'd rather tool an English four-in-hand
Than hold the leading-rein of this rum beast, Sir.

As leader. If needs be, I '11 mount and ride him!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business. To Mr. Lionel Brough at the Avenue,
about "A Mint of Money" at Toole's Theatre.
My dear Brough,
Couldn't write before, though I know, while you were play-
ng the Baron in La Vie, last Thursday night, you were dying to
know how J. L. Toole was getting on in his new piece, by Mr. A.
Law, called A Mint of Money,—a combination of names which, as
y ju, with the excellent theological training in early life, that has
been of such great service—morning and evening service—to you,
would probably say, suggests, hopefully, the "Law and the
profits." I am sure I join you heartily in this wish. The First Act
starts a new idea as a dramatic motive; namely, a Lady, possessed of
mesmeric power, entirely subjugating a weak good-natured person,
and making him her slave. Now, there can be only two ways of
treating this, either the utterlv farcical, or the intensely tragic: and
whatever might have been the Author's intention, the effect of
mesmerism on such a subject as your old friend Johnnie Toole
must be irresistibly comic.
Mr. Toole is mesmerised by an Irish adventuress, who, however,
really does possess this mysterious power, so that she is not a humbug,

"Catching the Speaker's Eye" at last.
and herein is a bit of muddle of character. The two adventurers
have apparently walked right out of L'Aventuriere,—Tom Robert-
son's Home at the Haymarket, though the home of most of his pieces
was the old Prince of Wales's,—and the incident of the man supposed
to have been killed while hiding in a coal-cellar, somehow or other
recalls the situation in L'Homme Blast,—I say "somehow," because
it is not exactly the same; the similarity consisting in Sir Charles (in
Used Up) escaping, in disguise, under the impression that he has
murdered the Blacksmith, while here Johnnie Toole escapes, in
disguise, under the impression that he has caused the death of Mr.
G. Shelton — D» you know Shelton? Very good.)—who plays a
cowardly, he toring, tipsy scoundrel, & Blather, capitally.
All the small parts are well played, and there's not a foreigner
among them, which would sound strange to your ears now, I suppose.
In fact, now you have become such a regular Comic Operatic Tenor
(is it tenor r) you would not care for playing in mere farce, or
in anything without music. This piece, however, gets on very well
as one harmonious whole, for the ensemble (useful word this, isn't
it ?) is excellent. The last Scene (I think Mr. Ryan is the Artist,
though I could not find his name in the bill, but only that of the
furniture provider, who is a theatrical Lyon), representing a forest
glade, is a triumph of scenic Art, and makes the little stage
appear double its size. The audience applauded it for several
seconds on the first night. In the centre of this Scene there is a
big tree with a large hole in the trunk, and its branches spread
out right and left, so as to leave a convenient place for sitting
in the centre. When I saw this, I couldn't help thinking of you.
I said to myself, "Now, if Brough were here, I'm sure it would
puzzle him to guess to what possible use that hole and that
resting-place in the middle of the tree are going to be put." I am
sure that as a Low Comedian it could never have struck you that
you might "get something out of" hiding in the hole, and then
getting up into the tree and overhearing an important conversation
carried on below while you were hidden away, though clearly visible
to the audience, like Charles the Second, up in the branches?
It would never, I am certain, have flashea across you that you
might get a roar by trying first to hide in that hole, ana then in get-
ting out again, with difficulty, at a very critical moment. No;
such notions might very naturally have occurred to Mr. Henry
Irving, Mr. Thomas Mead, Mr. Fernandez, or Mr. John Clayton,
but not, I am convinced, to you. Now, would you believe it, my
dear Brough, that, first of all, the eccentric Mr. Shelton hid his
clothes in that hole, and that, subsequently, J. L. Toole climbed up
the trunk, and then actually made a joke about being " up a tree " <
He did; I give you my word of honour he did. And if yon think that
the audience were so struck with the novelty of the situation, and of

Mr. J. L. Toole in his celebrated imitation of Mr. Beerbohme Tree.
the remarks he made when he was concealed from view, saying absurd
things so loud as to be heard by the audience, but quite " over the
heads" of the people on the stage, that they could not laugh, but
remained aghast at the actor's and author's boldness in devising such a
startling and strikingly novel situation, you are wrong, my dear
boy, for they roared, and so did I, and so did everyone; and while it
is perfectly true that the inefficiency of any one of the company
would have been enough to have imperilled the play, yet it is no less
true that, as you will easily imagine, its entire success was your old
friend Johnnie's broadly comic rendering of Mr. Law's dialogue
and situations.
The dialogue is full of points,—it is all points. There's no chance
of sitting down anywhere without coming on a point, and immedi-
ately going on again. It is a one-part piece, but it isn't a one-
character piece. J. L. Toole's is the part, but all the others are
individualised characters, and all have something to do, and all do it
well. Mr. Billington's make-up is wonderful. I thought he was
meant for a middle-aged American; but he wasn't. Had he been
intended for that, he would have been more than wonderful, he would
have been simply perfect.
Miss Emily Thorne, as the mother of seven girls named after the
days of the week,—a weakly family,—was excellent; and Miss
Sabah-Bernhardt-Beere-Marie-Fedora-Linden looked charm-
ing as Miss Thursday, with not much to do, but plenty of time to
do it in, and she did it well. Mr. Bancroft-Waed was very good
too, as an undecided young man in love with all the sisters. Sorry
you can't see it. Couldn't you get round from the Avenue to Toole's
during one of those intervals when you are listening with rapt
attention to the five or six encores accorded to our tuneful friend,
General Arthur Roberts? Try,—you'll be back in time for
Roberts's last encore. Wish you a Happy New Year. Heard you
were going to play the Curate at the Novelty Theatre, where the
New Magdalen is doing very well. If you had, you might have told
your excellent story of the nice-spoken clever boy," en? "Vot a
larks!" eh? Good-bye. May you live long and brosber."
Yours ever, Nibbs.
Sticks and Stocks.
"Lord Ernest Hamilton is retiring from the Army in order to become a
member of the Stock Exchange."—Truth.
A Paradox this seems to be,
Whereat some folks may mock:
A Soldier for the Stock Exchange
Must now Exchange his Stock.
A Lady says she never takes Salad on account of the Lucca oil in
it. An Italian Warehouseman in the Haymarket, which p'raps his
name is the ancient Barto Valle, an Old Master in Oils, says
this is " a. pure ile objection."

Paul's Churchyard.
THE TAKING OF MONACO.
(A Look ahead.)
It is perhaps as well to recapitulate the circumstances which led
to the recent bombardment and capture of Monte Carlo. It may be
remembered that the Prince of this State, being in financial diffi-
culties, secretly disposed of his territory to an Eastern gentleman, I
one Li Tung Chow, belonging to the sect contemptuously styled by
the French Chinois Paiens, wno are renowned for their devotion to
the sacred mysteries of Les Trois Cartes, Manche Pleine, and L'A.i
en Botte. These heathen rites being especially distasteful to the
strong'religious feelings of the French Republic, representations
were made to Li Tung Chow that unless he evacuated Monaco, he
would be likely to be expelled by force. Li Tung Chow's answer to
the French Envoy was short, figurative, and expressive. He grace-
fully applied his right thumb to his tiptilted nostrils, and extended
the fingers of his hand towards the Ambassador. "Go to Bath!"
is probably the nearest verbal rendering to this symbolical act.
The Prince of Monaco, however, had become thoroughly alarmed,
and having had his subsidy banked in advance, he was the more
ready to get rid of his obnoxious tenant. Accordingly, Li Tung
Chow was, despite all protests on his part, somewhat impolitely con-
ducted to a steamer, and despatched to the Celestial Empire. Great
rejoicings followed his departure. The Ruler of Monaco placed a tax
on soap, and the Municipality of Paris not only indulged in fireworks,
but changed the names of sixteen streets. How misplaced were
these festivities! About four months after Li Tung Chow's expul-
sion, a Chinese fleet, consisting of ten first-rate ironclads, sixteen
gunboats, and eight large troopships, appeared before Monte Carlo,
and demanded in the name of the Emperor of China the surrender
of the place to his vassal, Ll Tung Chow. The Prince, who had no
desire to meet that gentleman again on earth, telegraphed to Paris
asking for instructions. The answer was Bhort and decisive—
"Defend yourself d outrance."
Almost immediately afterwards the following despatch from the
Chinese Commander, Long Bo, was "communicated" by the
Minister of Marine to the Pekin Gazette :—
_ " To-day, the fleet, under my orders, opened fire on the fortifica-
tions of Monte Carlo. These fortifications exist no longer. The
Monagascan Army fought with determined bravery, but is no more.
The enemy's losses during the attack were at least ninety thousand
men. We have captured six thousand brass cannon, of which four
thousand are rifled, eighty thousand kilogrammes of dynamite, four
hundred barrels of nitro-glycerine, one hundred thousand rifles, and
six million cartridges. Our losses are one man and a boy."
Later.—"The trench Government has disclaimed any knowledge
of the Prince of Monaco's acts. I have re-annexed his territories.
Still Later.—" I am off to Paris by the Mail, to stop for a month
at the Elysee with the President of the French Republic."
Yet Later.—"Paris.—Magnificent reception. City illuminated.
Have received Grand Cross of Legion of Honour. Municipality
called New Boulevard after me, and decreed sixteen streets to be
named after Chinese notabilities. Shan't be back for a year."
"ANNO DOMINI."
A lonq array (by Long, R.A.). Is't great?
Why yes, in one sense,—sixteen feet by eight.
But many feel, as from its spread they part,
Though "Art is long," Long is not always Art!
"Yes, my dear," said Mrs. Rvmsbotuam, speaking of her invalid
Uncle, "the poor old gentleman has had a stroke of parenthesis, and
when last I saw him, he was in a state of comma."

PLAY AT THE WORKHOUSE.
It has come to the knowledge of Mr.
Punch that at certain Workhouses, Asylums,
and Hospitals, where, during this festive
season, various entertainments have been
given for the supposed delectation and relief
of the poor, the sick, and the suffering, the
very evil custom has recently obtained of
filling up all the front places with a motley
crowd of visitors, guests, and patrons, while
the genuine audience of the occasion, the
inmates of the respective establishments
themselves, have been relegated to the back
of the room, where they can neither see
what is going on, nor hear a word of what
is being said. There is unfortunately
nothing very new about this genial method
of dispensing ISritish Charity. The typical
'' Institution," no matter for whose benefit
or by whose benevolence it has been
founded, speedily in this country develops
into a rather brutal and plainspoken sort of
Almshouse, where every recipient of the
particular charity is made to understand
that he ought thoroughly to feel his depen-
dent position, and be humbly and submis-
sively grateful for the great privileges of
which he, a pauper, is considerately suffered
to partake.
For this not over agreeable outcome of
our National Endowed Charity, the patro-
nising attitude, inseparable from the smug
respectability by which it is surrounded, if
not supported, is mainly responsible. So it
happens that, when marching with the
times, a Board here, or a set of Governors
there, decide on providing a little seasonable
and pleasant entertainment for the poor or
the suffering entrusted to their supervision,
Officialism steps in, and being really
honestly convinced that there would be
something incongruous, if not even mon-
strous, in showing a pauper to a front place,
and treating him, even once in a way, with
the courtesy and consideration proper to
ordinary mortals, appropriates five rows of
stalls itself, and fills up the whole body of
the hall with its wives and daughters, its
cousins, its sisters, and its aunts, over whose
fair heads, as they enjoy a more or less
exhilarating three hours outing for nothing,
the presumed "patrons" of the evening s
entertainment stare as well as they can
from the crush in which they are huddled
together anyhow about the distant doorways.
Now, this is a scandal; and though one to
which there are honourable exceptions, still
one that has obtained too much of late to
admit of its being passed over any longer
in silence.
Having said this, Mr. Punch feels he has
said enough. He mentions no names—this
time. However, he tenders to the culpable
this one bit of advice, which he trusts may
be acted upon when, at the close of the
present year, the idea is again mooted, as
no doubt it will be, of giving another annual
treat. If it be necessary then, as now, that
Officialism and its family should have a
cheap entertainment at somebody's expense,
let it be drafted off to the nearest local
Music-hall, and its entrance to the sixpenny
seats be defrayed from the funds of the
Institution, and charged to "Petty Cash."
But let it not be admitted within the
precincts of the rival establishment on the
gala day. Let that, stalls and all, provide
something better than a mockery of a show
for its inmates, though they be those social
the recipients of British Charity.

vist Propaganda's aspiration for liberty.

"We read with considerable alarm that seven thousand whistles have been ordered for

become after a time. Now that the Police anthem is " Whistle, and I'll come to ye, my

THE MODERN ARS AMANDI.
{By Punchius Naso.)
CANTO VIII.—Conclusion.
What more, 0 Muse? To exhaust the eternal theme
Of every songster's lay and schoolgirl's dream,

Studied beneath Chaldea's starry skies,
And sung in Cheyne Walk or Clapham Rise,'
Were hopeless as on crutches to pursue
The sweeping comet through the boundless blue.
Punch lays down principles that cannot fail,
All else is iteration and detail.
P«ci-ridden Pegasus has earned a rest.
Does gentle Psyche blame the frequent jest?
Psyche the lambent-eyed, whose pure-lined lip,
Shell-curved and sensitive, seems shaped to sip
Arcadian honey-dew? What said the Sage?
That Love and Laughter shared the motley page
Of the New Ars Amandi. Not the mirth
Of goat-foot Faunus, savouring of gross earth
And revel rude; not Rabelais' loud " gros rire,"
The satyr-roar chaste Una well may fear,
Wood-wandering, sole and saintly; but the light
Soul-pregnant merriment, which makes more bright
Sweet Will's sun-dappled Arden, in whose glades
Cupid with Momus madly masquerades.
"Love "—so sang sparkling Praed—" is like a play."
Just so. With interludes of frolic gay
And fiery passion, scenes of high-strung joy
And bits of broad burlesque, in which the boy
Plavs Puck or Tartuffe or Polichinelh:
Under which king? The merry marriage bell
Riuirs many sorts of music in our ears,
Besides the choric chimings of the spheres.
Here sounds the chink of guineas; young Lisette
For bullion'd age has spread the skilful net:
There clantrs the muffled clank of splendid chains,
Lilian hath bought blue blood and sapless brains
With dainty charm and dowry. Both may hold
That Punch should teach them how to hit the gold,
And own 'twere something foolish to suppose Eros
Wastes his best darts upon the rude rhinoceros.
Art hath so various aims, the Art of Love
Not less than others. Will Apelles move
To inspiration only? From the chink
Of ducats base will dainty Phidias shrink?
Enough! But, Psyche, ifthe sex's choice
Be guileless Eros of the fluty voice
And radiant front, who dowers the dull cold earth
With honest passion, and with happy mirth,—
Eros the ever young though old of days,
Whom Protean Fashion with its modish maze
Of monstrous mutability may not snare,
Whom Mammon moves not, whom the motley wear
Of age, or rank, or race may not disguise ;—
Why, (hen, Love's surest hooks are honest eyes.
Like yours, my Psyche, which uplifted so
Make the old heart of Punchtus throb and glow.
Old heart? Nay, hearts, while hearts, are ever young.
The callous muscle dry as a neat's tongue,
At seventeen or seventy, hath no claim
More than a shrivelled pump-valve to that name.
The heart hath its own art. The blameless guile
Of cunning glance and calculated smile,—
Cunning most simple, calculation sweet
As counting kisses!—strategy complete
Of ambushed charms and Parthian attacks,
These only prudes reprove, and only quacks
Pretend to teach. The overstudied look
Becomes an ogle, blushes learned by book
And mirror-studied dimples witch not long,
Grow mechanised like eighteenth century song,
And ghastly as a mask whose set grimace
Apes hideously quick Beauty's mobile face.
And yet Youth knows not all its wealth of charm,
And Maidenhood may not essay each arm
That Nature furnishes. Reserves as large
As hers who glowed upon the Nile-borne barge
All may not hold. Her "infinite variety,"
In scope as well as strength might shock, Society,"
Whose very whimsies are conventional.
Its vices cut to pattern. But the thrall
Of Loveliness were strengthened fifty-fold
Did the large heart and living fancy hold
Far higher honour in her glittering court.
The power of soul, the play of frolic sport,
Are Love-auxiliaries that never fail,
Yield Love-delights that " custom cannot stale."
Would you, my pure-eyed Psyche, learn to be
A blameless Cleopatra? Antony
Lurks yonder; yes, I see him through the leaves,
In tennis flannels, not the Roman greaves.
Let the youth wait! He lives upon your smiles.
Sweet diet truly! Not with serpent wiles
Need you your sway to strengthen. But in love
One may be a sagacious little dove,
And shun the mere monotony of cooing,
Remembering that life is not all wooing.
This " infinite variety" above
All lesser craft, is the true Art of Love,
Best outcome of its nature, fine result
Not of cold artifice, but careful cult.
Man's heart hath many moods, and loving wit
Will work those moods to vary and to fit.
Two arms of Love, the phantasy that shifts,
The sympathy that tracks, are dual gifts
Of the eternal Eros, which too oft
Are disregarded for the silken-soft
And honey-sweet alone. Hence many a check
In happy wooing, many a piteous wreck
In Matrimony's sea.
There, Psyche! Now
The troubled wrinkles leave that tender brow,
And fades the wistful shade from radiant eyes.
Sweet girl, 'tis not so easy to be wise,
With weary life-lore, as a burden borne,
Yet keep all shafts of mockery and of scorn
Close in Wit's quiver, as yon genial God,
Who midst the myrtles waits his
laureate's nod,
Keeps his best dartlets from un-
worthy heart,
Cold, wicked, or world-hardened.
Ah! you start!
The genuine Eros? Yes. And
as of old
Your classic namesake felt his
pure arms fold
Gently about her gracious soul,
may you,
Fair English Psyche, know the
tender, true
Clasp of true love. You do?
Well, verbum sap.
Antony waits, and PuNcmrs
needs a nap!
Finis.
Mrs. Ramsbotkaii wants to know in what musioal work is to be
found the well-known line,
"Like kidneys blithe and merry."
She thinks the title of the Opera had something to do with cards.
"Was it," she asks, "Aces and Galatia"? But she is not certain.
Only it occurred to her at breakfast the other morning.

VERY TRYING.
A Record of a few Trials oj Patience.
No III.—The Important Chief Clkrk.
N taking his usual seat below the
Magisterial bench, Mr. Bigley
Magnus, the Chief Clerk, addressing
the Usher, asked whether the learned
Magistrate had yet arrived?
Usher. He had not arrived a
moment ago, Sir.
Mr. Bigley Magnus {the Chief
Clerk). Then I can only say it is a
disgraceful waste of time. It is
now four minutes past the hour,
and if I, who have to come all the
way from Dalston, can manage to
be punctual, surely it is equally
possible for the Magistrate, who
lives in May fair, to be in time.
Usher. It's not my fault, Sir
Mr. Bigley Magnus (the Chief
Clerk, angrily). Hold your tongue.
The conduct of this Court is disgraceful, and ought to be noticed by
the Press. Where are the Keporters?
Usher. I don't know, Sir. We've nothing to do with the Reporters.
Mr. Bigley Magnus (the Chief Clerk). Hold your tongue, Sir.
How dare you contradict me? One can't, however, expect the
Reporters to be punctual if such a bad example is set them by the
Magistrate.
At five minutes past ten the learned Magistrate took Ms seat upon
the bench.
John Donovan, labourer, was charged with assaulting Patrick
Murphy. Murphy, whose head was
entirely bandaged, deposed that at ten
o'clock at night he was walking along the
Euston Road
Mr. Bigley Magnus (the Chief Clerk).
Which side?
Witness (mistaking Mr. Bigley Magnus,
the Chief Clerk, fur the learned Magis-
trate). The other side, your Worship.
Mr. Bigley Magnus (the Chief Clerk).
Wrong district. Remove the Prisoner.
(To Witness.) You must prefer your
charge at Marylebone Police Court.
Witness. I prefer it here, your Worship.
Mr. Bigley Magnus (the Chief Clerk—to Gaoler). Do as I tell you,
please. (To Witness.) Leave the box—go to Marylebone. Call on
next case.
The Learned Magistrate. One moment, please. I don't want to
interrupt the proceedings more than necessary, but the Witness only
said he was walking on the other side of Euston Road. I don't
suggest otherwise; but, as it may transpire that the actual assault
eventually took place this side of the road, I think it desirable that
we should, hear all the Witness has to say. Being the Magistrate, I
have taken the liberty of offering my opinion upon the matter.
Mr. Bigley Magnus (the
Chief Clerk—to Gaoler).
Bring the Prisoner back.
My sole object was, if
possible, to save the public
time.
The Witness, Patrick
Murphy, then proceeded
with his evidence. He
said : — I was walking
along, your Honour, when
suddenly I was struck a
fearful blow, your Worship.
Mr. Bigley Magnus (the
Chief Clerk). Now, that is
the point. Were you
struck the other side?
Witness. No, your Hon-
our—this side.
Mr. Bigley Magnus (the
Chief Clerk). Do you mean
to say you were struck this
side of the road?
Witness. No, your Hon-
our. I was struck this side
of the head? (Laughter
in Court.)
Mr. Bigley Magnus (the Chief Clerk). If there is any further
attempt at laughter, the Court shall be cleared. (To the Magistrate.)
You see, Sir, you have no jurisdiction—the assault occurred the other
side of the road. (To Gaoler.) Remove the Prisoner. (To Witness.)
Go to Marylebone.
The Learned Magistrate. One moment, please. I have evidently

misunderstood the Witness. I heard nothing about his being struck
the other side of the road. (To Witness.) Please to inform me—I
am the Magistrate—in what particular position were you when you
were struck?
Witness (confused). I was struck all of a heap.
Mr. Bigley Magnus (the Chief Clerk, violently). But where?
What spot?
Witness. In the middle, your Worship.
Mr. Bigley Magnus (the Chief Clerk). Middle of what?
Witness. Middle of the road, of course.
The Learned Magistrate. Were you assaulted on this side of the
Euston Road—if I may be
allowed to ask a question?
Witness. No, Sir; he only
kicked me this side of the road.
The Learned Magistrate.
This is certainly an awkward
question of jurisdiction. The
Witness first was assaulted
the other side of the road,
which belongs to Marylebone
distriot; then in the middle,
which belongs, I presume, to
both; and, lastly, this side of
the road, which, of course, is
in our district. I will retire,
and consult my colleague on
the point.

In the Panto, at the " Lane,"
And my togs is somewhat airy

And I don't complain of waiting
About them ice-cold winjrs,

Nor of swearing and such things;
For they 're what we all get used to
And must bear 'em with a grin;

We are kids, but we are trying

We are working when you 're crying,

And it's nice for us to know
That we save them cares and bothers

And, if our eyes are weary.
And we tired look at night,
And we can't be gay and cheery,
Just you think we 're weak and slight;
Just think we 're 'mong the many

Just believe we earn our penny,
And not spend the pound you do,
But believe (if you trust any)
That we 're children just like you!

pilgrimage. Perhaps there's something symbolio in the word
Hudson " on the side. Perhaps this old dressing-gown I've got on
is part of a religious ceremony. Shouldn't wonder. Anyhow, it's
great fun being a "sacred beast." Still, it is strange they should
want to drag me over here. A little boy has just looked through a
chink, and shouted, "0 my! ain't he black neither I" I '11 ask the
High Priest who has come with me as a steerage passenger, what
this means. Tells me to "mind my own business, and be quiet
before Bartlett." Don't like his manner—a deal too mysterious.
Something's up—that's certain. But what? Mem.—Try and think

body seems very angry, because I'm not "white"! What a
joke! Fanoy a White Elephant! Why—whoever heard of such a
thing? Yet they seem to be getting to high words about it. Yes,—
surely that's Babtlett calling the High Priest "a swindling old
nigger." This seems to have put everybody in a good temper again,
for they are all laughing heartily. Catch random suggestions.
Somebody wants to whitewash me. Somebody else Bays, "It will
come off, and make him look worse than ever." I fancy the Secretary
is trying to get me painted with white lead, and picked out with ver-
milion, like a Christmas Clown. This annoys the High Priest, who
says Buddha wouldn't stand it, and he has called Mr. Bartlett a
"twangialalloung "; but as there is no interpreter handy, the latter
has simply retorted, "You're another!" Wish they would settle
something without quarrelling. Fresh free-fight—evidently about me.
All I oan catch now is, " Then, wash him yourself." What will they
be up to next 'i Sending for somebody, are they? Bother the lot!

done up in small oval tablets. We eat six each. Excellent f Ha!
here's Bartlett, with twenty attendants, scrubbing-brushes, mops,

Over now!—every bit of it used; but a precious time I've had of
it! Such a lather! Still, the result is wonderful. I'm not white,
but I certainly have come out fresh and pinky to an extent that
quite startles me; and even the High Priest said " he wouldn't have
known me," and is in constant fits of laughter. I have signed the
recommendation form of that soap at once. Here it is, for the
benefit of the proprietors:—
"I have used nothing else for ten minutes, and consider it match-
less for the trunk and complexion. "Tor/NG."

lit Bond Street.
Should anyone find himself, on one of these gloomy January
afternoons, wandering in rather low spirits among the excellent col-
lection of the great Sir Joshua's Works now on view at the Grosvenor
Gallery, let him take heart, and turn to the Catalogue. Whether it
is that Mr. ¥. G. Stephens, the accomplished Gentleman who has
contributed the historical and "illustrative"Notes to that publication,
has either had a special eye to brightening up a melancholy half-
hour or so, or has been in a great hurry over the correction of his
proofs, it is difficult to say; but the fact remains, that in the letter-
press for which he is responsible he has provided some very subtle
conundrums. In his commentary on No. 5, a three-quarter length
portrait of Sir Joshua himself in his Academic dress, he insinu-
ates that there is something so speaking about the likeness of
the President, that the very attire in which he is arrayed, is posi-
tively communicative. "The Red Gown," he says, alluding to Sir
Joshua's trappings, "refers to Reynolds's costume of D.C.L.,"
though he does not explain in what terms the official robe expresses
itself.
It is to be hoped, however, it conveys its meaning a little more
lucidly than does Mr. Stephens himself, continuing This allusion to
the picture, a few lines further on. Stc.
"A version, in a similar costume, of this picture are in the Florence
Gallery of celebrated painters* portraits, presented by Sir Joshua to be placed
in the great collection of portraits there, on his admission to the Academy
there. The Duke of Rutland has a third picture in a similar costume.
"This portrait was exhibited at the British Institution in 1813, when the
fovernors of that society formed their first collection of pictures by old and
eceased modern masters, and inaugurated the series with a body of the works
of Sir Joshua Reynolds, 143 in all, which, until the present exhibition was
formed, was the most numerous aggregate of the kind. It was not included
in the next considerable collection of Reynoldses, that which was made at
the British Institution in 1823. It was in the same place in 1843."
Passing by " old and deceased modern masters," who, by the way,
must have been a rather ghastly set of celebrities, Mr. Stephens
scores again over No. 42, described as "A Negro, said to be Frank
Barber, Dr. Johnson's black servant," thus :—
"It was he who received Miss Mokkis, who Bat for ' Hope nurtinq Love'
bv Reynolds, when she called on the Doctor, and, finding him on tne point
of death, heard his last words when he turned his face to the wall, saying,
1 God bless you, my dear !'"
This is very quaintly confusing, though perhaps less so than
another reference to the Doctor, made under picture 119 further on,
which runs as follows:—
"In Boswbll's account of his tour with Dr. Johnson in the Hebrides,
1773, is, with much other matter concerning the Earl, an interesting notice
of a visit to Slain. Castle, Aberdeen, and the reception of his friends bv the
Earl of Erroll and his Countess (Isabella, born Cark of Etal,
Northumberland) in that ancient feudal residence, with particular reference
to this painting, which hung in the drawing-room when the pair went there
to take coffee after dinner."
Here Mr. Stephens is almost at his best. How can " 1773, with
much other matter concerning the Earl," be an interesting notice of
a visit to Slains Castle? This is a regular poser. Who, too, are
"the pair"? The Earl of Ekholl and his Countess Isabella? or
the Earl and one of his anonymous friends? or the ancient feudal
residence and the painting? But, then—" Coffee after dinner "? It
is really a most pleasing enigma!
But lack of space prevents a further quotation from this excellent
and playful Catalogue. Those, however, who desire to see a speci-
men of artistic English, "as she can be wrote"—should lose no
time in purchasing a copy: for, as the words " Under Revision" are
printed on the cover, and Mr. F. G. Stephens's name is followed by
the encouraging legend, "In Progress," it is reasonable to assume
that a revised edition is already on its way.
To Turtle-Mockers.
Ardent reformers who speak disrespectfully of the Lord Mayob,
and say rude things concerning the Corporation, talk somewhat
rashly of " making a clean sweep" of all the fine old Civic institu-
tions. "Making a clean sweep is somewhat analogous to washing
a blackamoor white—a proverbially difficult operation, and notoriously
unsatisfactory when accomplished.

LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business.
1. To Mr. Harry Pautton. 2. To M. Jacobi. 3. To Mr. Bancroft.
1. To Mr. Harry Paullon, at the Avenue.
My bear Paulton,
You are playing in Falka, and cannot get about, so I hasten
to relieve your anxiety as to the success of Princess Ida and George
Grossmith at the Savoy.
Well, I went there the other night—not the first night, but when
it had been working for ten days or so—and I found (tell your Man-
ager Henderson this, as I am sure he '11 be only too pleased) the
house crammed. In the third row of the Stalls I saw our old friend
Lord Houghton, who, before even the first note of the overture was
sounded, had already assumed the black cap, associated in my legal
mind with sentence of condemnation on the unlucky culprits, and
passing the extreme sentence of the law. Such a display of bias on
the part of a public man, considered I believe as a good judge, I have
rarely seen.
I was not so near his Lordship as to be able to cateh the exact
terms of the judicial sentence, but it must havo been something like,
"Oh, you go and be hung !"—addressed to Author, Composer, Man-
ager, and all the company,—which would be quite sufficient to
account for the admirable way in which the operatic extravaganza
was subsequently executed.
Now, what you are so eager about is to learn whether our excellent
and amusing George Grossmith has a good part or not, and how he
plays it, whatever it is. Well, candidly, it is a good part as far as it
goes; but as it only consists of a good
entrance, one capital song, and a
few telling lines in the Prologue,
nothing at all in the Second Act,
and a bit in the Third, when he
seems to be dragged on because " we
must have George again with
another song" (not equal to the first)
and no action, no business, no
situation whatever, — you will see
the part does not go very far, and,
having told you this, I am sure you
will thoroughly sympathise with an
audience who come for the fun of
the thing," and who don't get it at
the Savoy in Princess Ida, Decause
they see next to nothing of the only
person on that Stage capable of
raising a laugh. A friend of mine
told me he thought George Gros-
smith " Robsonian," and I am snre,
my dear Paulton, that you will
agree with me in saying that George
is no more "Robsonian " than you
are.
Nobody else is funny per se. There
are three men in armour—the two
gendarmes in Genevieve, with one
added—whose combined force in the
Bouncerian Rataplan style is at first amusing. I suppose Sir Arthur
is bound to put in something of this sort now, as he has a Handel to
his name. Their best time, however, is in the situation before their
fight in the last Act, when they take off their armour bit by bit, and
prepare to fight in their shirt-sleeves, as the Lifeguardsman tola the
King that he should like to do if Waterloo came over again. The
best jeu de mot in the piece is where Ida tells the old woman who
could not say "Amen" that " are men" stuck in her throat.
The Scenery—but this won't interest you so much—is perfect,
simply perfect; the costumes of the first and second Acts charming;
but not so those of the Prologue. There should be no f aults at the
Savoy, where time and money are" no object, and Author, Composer,
and Manager have only to attend to the getting up of one piece in
every eighteen months or so. You are a good Stage Manager, and
your friend Mr. Farnie used to be, and can be now if he likes, I
daresay, where crowds in action have to be dealt with, and both you
and he will be deeply grieved to hear that there is a meaningless
monotony about the action of everyone in Princess Ida which is
irritatingly wearisome.
Have you ever heard and seen George Grossmith do his " drama
on crutches?" Of course you have. Do you remember his imita-
tion of the Gilbert-Sullivan Opera with the action of the chorus of
girls? Well, in Princess Ida it is all this. The girls—nay, even
the three men when dressed up as girls—are either bobbing and
curtseying or extending their hands beseechingly, or, if grouped, the
most striking tableau is obtained by a repetition of the decidedly
ungainly postures adopted in Patience, and the audience is shown a

evidently been considered the greatest possible advantage. Now,
Mr. Gilbert, with all his resources, could have managed far
better than this, had he chosen to do so, just as he has written in the
dialogue portion of it, a better
libretto to Princess Ida than he
did to Iolanthe, only the song-
words (excepting the one for
George GROssMrrn, which is
simply first-rate) are not a patch

between Miss Jessie Bond
(always sprightly and graceful)
and the stately Miss Brandrav,
recalls the duet in Iolanthe
between Miss Braham and
Mr. Temple—only, in both
cases, to the disadvantage of
Princess Ida. If you had had
to do the libretto, and had had
to act in the piece as well, I
feel sure you would have made

selves as women, and would
have written up King Gama
for yourself, or vice versa. And you would have taken precious
good care to have been on in the Second Act, and to have had. your

smooth, with quaint conceits, and a fair amount of dry humour (after
your own heart, my dear Paulton), yet there is a lack of fun.

than those at the first and last-named Theatres. The Principals have
a fairish dance during, and at the end of every song, for all the world,
as in an ordinary Burlesque, only that the dancing is not so good,
and a few lessons from Miss Kate Vaughan, Miss Nellie Farren,
and one or two others I could mention, would improve them. In
fact, I was moved to laughter, rather, hy their attempts at dancing
than hy any really well-executed comic steps.
I am sure that the Public, after the first curiosity is satisfied, will
grumble at not having enough of "Gee-Gee" (my amusing way of
naming George Gbossmith, you see—and a Carte can't go on with-
out a gee-gee or a donkey, eh ?); but if you can chuck up whatever
you 're doing now, and come to the Savoy to play King Gama, and get
your friends Gilbert and Sullivan to write up one of the brothers tor
Geoboe Gbossmith, with a good song in addition to the present one
about the " disagreeable Man," which can be easily transferred, and
plenty of comic business, there will then be no reason why the piece
shouldn't run for several years,—" for a score," as Sir Akthitb
Sullivan would say, if you didn't say it first,—but that wouldn't
prevent him, as he'd re-set it, and give it such a turn as would give
you such a turn when you heard it again. How's Falka f
Yours ever, Nibbs.
2. To Mons. Jacobi, at the Avenue.
Cher Jacobi,
You cannot get away to hear Sullivan's music in Ida,
which you must not confuse with A'ida. Well—you, as a thorough
musician, would be immensely pleased with it from a purely musical
point of view, but, as a popular Dramatic Composer and Director,
you will be sorry that there are not as many " catchy " tunes in it
as there were in Pinafore, or even in Iolanthe.
As to the Orchestra, no one will be more delighted than yourself
to see how well it is kept under, how the singers are allowed a chance,
and how the audience's ears are spared the soothing but too frequent
booming of the drum, the inspiring but deafening clanging of the
cymbals, and the heart-stirring but head-splitting harmonies per-
formed by the united brass in full blow! The performance of such
an Orchestra would delight you. You will be also sorry to hear that,
as I am informed, The Golden Ring is to be taken off the Alhambra
boards at Easter. Anything going wrong at your old Alhambra home
must be a source of deep trouble to your tender artistic sympathies.
Tout d vout, Nibbs.
3. To Mr. Bancroft, at the Haymarkct.
Dear Bancboft,
I haven't time to tell you more than that Bbuce's Theatre,
the Prince's, is open. Quite a near neighbour—just round the
corner—so do look in. You will be delighted to find how wonder-
fully theatrical architecture has improved since you re-constructed
the Haymarket. Such a smoking-room! Staircase quite a game of
marbles! But I will give you a full description about it on another
occasion. House brilliant—piece dull. Miss Tilbubt made the hit
—decidedly Tilbury/orfe. Yours, Nibbs.
THE NOTE-BOOK OF A DETECTIVE JOUENALIST.
Unbavellino the Egyptian Question.
Pakt II.—(Conclusion.)
It was a proud moment!
I had actually, assisted by my clever disguise as the Duke of
Cambridge, obtained admission to the room of the Field-Marshal
Commanding-in-Chief at the Horse Guards. I was alone in the
apartment. On my manly form was the composite uniform that had
been kindly provided for me by the Bow Street Theatrical Costumier,
and in my right hand I Jk Id the telephone which had put me
into direct communication with Mr. Gladstone, President of a
Cabinet Council being held in Downing Street.
I listened. There was a roar of laughter. Mr. Chamberlain
had made a joke. He had convulsed his colleagues with a Vestry
side-splitter.
"Are you still there, your Royal Highness?" asked Mr. Glad-
stone through the telephone. Then, on my answering in the affirma-
tive, he continued: "We have been chatting over the Egyptian
difficulty. We none of us quite know what to do. Lord Northbbook
has suggested that we might send out a force of Marines under the
command of His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, who,
your Royal Highness will recollect, is Colonel of the Regiment. We
thought, Sir, that you might be able to say whether your illustrious
relative would like such a post."
"I am sure that, were His Royal Highness to be appointed to the
command, he would make it a stipulation, before accepting it, that he
should receive no pecuniary benefit by the transaction."
I said this, as I wished to show Mr. Gladstone that naturally,
as the Duke of Cambridge, I knew the leading characteristics of the
various members of the Royal Family.
"Certainly," replied the Premier through the telephone. "Cer-
tainly. But that is a matter that the Hlustrious Duke may safely
leave in the hands of the Lords of the Admiralty, by whom His
Royal Highness's appointments to the command of the Reserves and
the Channel Fleet were arranged. All I would say now is"
I allowed the telephone to drop! I was transfixed with surprise,
horror, confusion! I had been so engrossed in the remarks of the
Premier that I had failed to notice the entrance into the room of a
Gentleman of a decided Military appearance.
"Will you be good enough to explain to me," said the newcomer,
in a grave gentle voice, which was absolutely free from excitement,
"why you have taken possession of my room?"
I saw that there was only one thing to do—brazen it out.
"Your room!" I exclaimed. "I like that! Why, Sir, are you
aware that you are addressing His Royal Highness the Duke of
Cambridge?"
"I really think you are labouring under a mistake," responded the
Gentleman of Military appearance, with polished politeness. "The
more so, as in point of fact, I happen to be the Duke of Cambridge
myself."
Sir, you are an impostor!" I cried, with well-assumed anger,
although my dominant feeling at the moment was rather shame than
rage.
"I think not," returned His Royal Highness, calmly. "But if
you will permit me, I will put the matter in dispute to a very simple
test. Allow me." And the Duke stretched forward, and rang the
bell.
In a few moments a Messenger appeared in obedience to the
summons.
"Be kind enough to show this Gentleman the door," said the Duke,
with a courteous bow of dismissal.
"You will see this person out." I exclaimed in my turn, haughtily.
The poor Messenger looked from one of us to uie other, in much
perplexity. Before Tie could make up his mind, the Hero of Tel-el-
Kebir (I knew him at once, from having seen so many of his photo-
graphs in the shop-windows) entered the apartment. In turn we
both appealed to him.
"My dear Lord," said His Royal Highness, "you surely recog-
nise me?"
"Garnet, my man, if you have any doubt about me, send for
Harry Roberts."
"You speak with undue familiarity," observed Lord Wolseley,
turning upon me, sharply;" that is not a characteristic of the Field
Marshal Commanding-in-Chief."
"Hang me!" I blustered.
"And you swear!" almost shrieked the Hero, aghast at the out-
rage. "And you dare to pretend that you are the Duke of Cam-
bridge! You are arrested f"
In a moment I was seized by a number of Privates in the Guards,
who until now had been comfortably warming themselves before a
fire; and doing nothing in particular in the entrance hall. Mean-
while, His Royal Highness held his fingers to his ears, for fear that
I should indulge in further strong language. I assured him, in the
deaf-and-dumb alphabet, that I would for the future keep a bridle
upon my tongue.
"What shall we do with him?" asked the Duke. "Have you
anything to say for yourself, Sir?"
I am merely a Journalist in pursuit of my vocation," I answered,
respectf ully, but proudly.
As I have explained in my Soldier's Pocket-Book," observed
Lord Wolseley, "I should like to shoot all Correspondents en
masse."
"Let us see if we can get anything out of the Queen's Regula-
tions," said His Royal Highness, consulting a book bound in red, and
having a brass clasp. I suppose we ought to find him under
'SpyP?"
And the two greatest warriors of this age, or, indeed, any other,
consulted for hours as to my fate. At length they came to a conclu-
sion.
"Prisoner," said Lord Wolseley, "we have had it in contem-
plation to try you by Drum-head Court-Martial, under the Articles
of War, when, no doubt, you would have speedily found yourself
before a half-Company of Infantry with loaded rifles. But, con-
sidering that, in spite of your Tom Fool's dress, you are merely
a Civilian, we have decided that you shall be removed from the
promises
"By a Policeman," interrupted the Duke,
again to say naughty words-
'after promising never
"And accepting membership in the Vine Club."
The last pledge was demanded by Lord Wolseley.
I gave the required assurances, and ten minutes later was on my
way to the office of my newspaper.
"I cannot understand," said Mrs. Ramsbotham, "all this fuss
about Harbours of Refuse. Why can't they let the refuse float
away out to sea? What do they want to harbour it for?"

THE OLD STORY.
With a new Application.
Who crieth " Wolf!"? Hot anger or cold derision
His cry will wake
From zealot hearty whose faith in optimist vision
No shock will shake,
From greed astute of the spider-soul which spreadeth
Its web unspied.
A Wolf? That earnest creature who gravely treadeth
Poor Toil beside,
With preacher-unction and prophet-sternness telling
The tales of hope,
On wealth and weal with specious reasoning dwelling,
And sounding trope?
No, no, 'tis selfish Privilege, proud Possession,
That thus malign
An honest gentleman. Every soft impression,
Each feeling fine
Finds home within him whose heart is just a storehouse
Of pure humanity,
Whose sympathy ranges freely from throne to poorhouse.
That grave urbanity,
No little lupine weaknesses can surely cover;
Serene he stands,
The proletariat's sole unselfish lover,
In all the lands.
Wolf! Well, for all his staidness and saintly unction,
What teeth he shows!
Were beast equipped for crunching without compunction
Or friends or foes,
What mightier molars, what sharper-pronged incisors
Could he display?
Labour, beware! Some would-be supervisors
Of toil and pay,
Stored Wealth's cool redistributors self-appointed,
Sworn setters-right
Of all in Time's long world-work that seems disjointed,
Untrim, untight,—
Some such, unconscious chartalans, pure fanatics,
Thus only stray,
That in dynamics doubtful, unsure in statics,
They fain would play
The social deus ex mac hind. But, friend Toil,
Wolves watch the fold.
Ware teeth! They mean devouring, and what their spoil,
Ere all is told,
The glib enthusiast wots not. Once have Theft
Enthroned King Stork,
And which of truer treasure will be bereft,
Or Wealth or Work,
Who knows? Sir Wolf in the old old youth-loved story,
Though glib and mild,
"Grandmamma " gone was not so long before he
Devoured the child!
Gas and Water.
The audience were said to be very unruly at the production of
Mr. Pinebo's play. We think they showed great selt-restraint, or
they would have sung "Turn off the Gas at the Meter t" at the
point when it is announced that the gas has been cut off. Let us
hope the water will not be cut off as well, and that very Low Water
will not become dry altogether. Low Waters Run Dry is scarcely
like Lord Tenntson's Brook, destined to "go on for ever."

THE SLUM-DWELLERS' SATURDAY NIGHT.
(A considerable distance after Burns.)
My gentle Public, much-respected friend!
No pastoral pipe the present singer plays:
Nor birds nor baDbling brooks their music lend
To limpid lines which woo the Critic's praise.
To you I sing, in sad and sombre lays,
The pariah's life in Town's sequestered scene,
The brute emotions strong, the loveless ways,
"What Culture in a Rookery might have been;
A wonderland of woe to happier hearts I ween.
November chill bites keen through fog and snow,
The short dim City day is near its close.
To miry slums from gas-world's cheery glow
Like bird obscene to sinister repose,
The worn Slum-dweller to his rookery goes.
This night his weekly moil is at an end;
Some scant-scraped coins, one-half of which he owes,
He hopes in rest and revelry to spend,
So shivering through the mist his way doth homeward wend.
At length his den-like lair appears in view.
Beneath its entry doorless, eagerly
His children crouch, their cheeks with want pinched blue,
Waiting their sire. "With curses frank and free
Their clamour he rebuffs. Not bonnily
His consort looks, and with no wifely smile;
The pallid infant huddled on her knee
Her heart to tenderness may scarce beguile,
Or his embruted soul to penury reconcile.
Anon his elder slips come lounging in
With dragging step and glance cast sullen down,
Prowlers and touts, alert to cadge or sin,
Mendicant-pests or ruffian plagues of town.
His eldest girl, Flash Jenny, woman-grown,
Her eyes with harpy-avarice fired, some free
Soiled squalid Bmartness in her flaunting gown,
Her coarse hand prompt to clutch dishonour's fee,
Promise of passing ease and reckless revelry.
With callous scorn brothers and sisters meet,
With brutal rudeness, or with cynic jeers;
Or if they talk, lewd patter of the street,
Or crime's last chronicle is all one hears.
The parents seek what these, the young in years
Yet old in vice, of wage or spoil may show
From toil or theft; the mother checks the tears
Of hungered babes with cuffs, whilst oaths not few
The father deals around as admonition due.
0 happy Home, where love like this is found!
0 pleasant promise! charm beyond compare!
The Singer, fancy-winded, pursues life's round,
And Sentiment has bid the bard declare,
"If Heaven a draught of real nectar spare
As cordial in this sad and sombre vale,
'Tis when a love-knit, marriage-chastened pair
8urvey their progeny in Home's safe pale,
Beneath their roof-tree gathered, ere their life-pulse fail."
No formal supper crowns their simple board,
"Board" have they none; they snatch uncertain food,
Beast-like alone as fortune may afford.
The pipe, fast comrade of the whole male brood,
They puff, rank-fumed, in sullen silent mood,
Or with such talk as the Muse may not tell,
Not e'en such Muse as Swim or Rabelais wooed;
The slum, grown garrulous, shames the lower Hell
By the dark Florentine limned so hideously well.
Then in foul corners closely packed away
The youngling outcasts seek a loathly rest;
The parent pair their secret homage pay
To the Drink-Fiend, their solace, scourge, and pest,
If their joint mites,—community unblest!—
Permit such common tribute, side by side
Father, wife, daughter, son, frenzy-possest,
In one short orgy of mad zest divide
"What for the slow week's scant subsistence should provide.
From scenes like these our land's dishonour springs.
"With blots like this at home, why look abroad
For heathen hordes or semi-savage kings
To coax along the Christian's way to God?
For certes on that self-same heavenly road
Untutored Caribs might leave far behind
Our own slum-savages. What sharper goad
Than survey of these shames of human kind
Needs there to wake the blandly blundering British mind?
A GREAT DISCOVERY!
Me. Punch, Sib,
I am a born Philanthropist; that is to say, I have been one
from my earliest infancy. As a child, I could have said with
Tennyson, had I known the line, "fast flowed the current of my
easy tears," at the affecting story of The Babes in the Wood; as
a youth, I shed them by the pailful over the Sorrows of Werther:
and in my mature manhood I heartily sympathised with Douglas
Jerbold's sensitive friend, who, when his coachman drove over a
poor old woman, ordered him to drive on as fast as possible, for her
shrieks were far too distressing for his agonised feelings to endure.
Such being the case, Sir, you may easily conceive with what lace-
rated feelings I perused one of Mr. Sims descriptions of " horrible
London "—Icould not manage more than one—and how eagerly I
have read every scheme that nas been suggested for the alleviation
of its horrors by a more equal distribution of wealth.
The paltry circumstance that my share of this world's goods is
comparatively small, has, I need scarcely say, nothing whatever to
do with my cordial sympathy with these several patriotic proposals.
No, Sir, philanthropy is my guiding star, pure, noble philanthropy.
Of course, when some mocking sceptic, Knowing that my small
savings are safely locked up in Consols, suggested the possibility of
relief being sought by what he calmly called the wiping out of the
National Debt, I felt it my duty to speak up so strongly for the
honour of my beloved country, that my cynical friend was glad to
beat a retreat. The simple fact that there is a nice little bit of
property in my own neighbourhood, belonging to a very rich man,
who cannot possibly want it, but which would just exactly suit me,
has, of course, nothing whatever to do with my strong predilection in
favour of a re-distribution, but is a mere fortuitous circumstance
that I feel myself bound in honour to mention.
The first scheme that I have examined into, is of a very simple
and comprehensible nature, namely, that the Land, as it belongs
to the People, should be fairly divided among us all, share and
share alike; but my objection to this, otherwise very reasonable,
proposition would be, that, as there are about twenty-six millions of
us in England and Wales, and only about thirty-seven millions of
acres of land, my share, as a single man, would be but about an acre
and a half, and, as my little bit of freehold might be on Salisbury
Plain or on a Welsh Mountain, I should certainly object to this
arrangement, unless I had a very early choice.
The next scheme is that of a Mr. George, who has come all the
way from America to teach us how to solve this nice little problem,
and, for all that he has contributed towards its solution, he might
just as well have stayed away, for a more supremely silly proposal
was never submitted to a sane audience. His absurd scheme is that
everybody is to pay the same rent as he pays now, but that he must
pay it to the State instead of to his Landlord! How is this to
relieve the very poor in their distress this American genius does not
condescend to inform us, and as to the great body of working men,
for whom he expresses such very needless compassion, all the good it
would do for them would be to largely cheapen their gin and their
tobacco, which most of their true friends, such as myself, who never
indulge in either, think to be quite cheap enough already. The silly
sop to the disconsolate widows, and the unmanly insult to the Queen,
I pass by as beneath contempt, but with just the one obvious remark,
that, if all widows are to be amply provided for, what sort of life
shall we poor bachelors lead, especially if not blessed with remarkably
strong constitutions?
No, Sir; these two propositions are alike absurd, and do nothing to
alleviate the condition of those who most require assistance. But it
does so happen that, after a lengthened and profound and dispas-
sionate consideration of the whole complicated subject, I have evolved,
out of my own inner consciousness, a scheme, so simple, and yet so
comprehensive in its beneficial effects, that every very poor person,
every working man, every toiling Clerk, every care-worn Tradesman,
every small Manufacturer, and also, I am happy to say, every brain-
worn Journalist or Literary Man, whether inhabiting his comfortable
villa, or his small suburban snuggery, or his thirty or forty-pounder,
in his dull lengthy street, or his three or four decent rooms, or even
his one miserable tenement, with its broken window, "that, coarsely
patched, gives way to the rude tempest, yet excludes the day," and
its walls so blank, that their shadows they thank for sometimes
falling there!"—all these veritable toilers and spinners would, at
one fell swoop, as it were, be relieved of their greatest burthen, and
be able to look the whole world in the face, with renewed hope,
renewed courage, and renewed life! "What that great panacea is, I
must leave for a future day. j_ Lpreu'lL

THE LATEST CRAZE.
{Letters from o young OeniUman of Fashion who "Adopted the Stage as
a Profession.")
My deae Duchess, 28> Shrimp Street, Shellford.
So the great Passwat-Binks was actually coming—his
special engagement " for one night only" was duly announced in big
letters—and his advent was eagerly watched for by us all. I was
frightened to death at having to play Robert Ffolliott to his Con, and
my alarm was in no way diminished by the Company, some of whom
almost hinted that Binks would throttle me HI didn't "watch it."
Passway Bines was to arrive from Slocum-on-the-Slosh by a train
reaching Shellford at eleven a.m., and would at once come to the
Theatre to rehearse. A deputation, consisting of Messrs. Debwent-
water, Garrick, and Snow (who I heard were subsequently joined
by Spider, Bones, and Captain Lardy, the famous Shellford Sand-
Niggers) went to meet Binks at the Station, and I was left with
the Ladies of the Company, anxiously awaiting the great man's
arrival at the Theatre. He arrived in due course, and made a little
speech to Miss Poster. (Mrs. Binks had just become a mother for
the ninth time. Mr. Garrick looked at me, as much as to say,
"There, now—what did I say to you? Call yourself an Actor; why,
you 're not even married!") I was much disappointed in Mr. Binks's
appearance; he was a colossal man, he was hot and untidy, and had
a taint suspicion, I thought, of gin about him. When rehearsal
began, he seemed to me to know nothing about Con, and to con-
fuse him generally with all Mr. Boucicauxt's Irish characters.
He called me "Masther Hardress," and " OGrady," and every-
thing but Robert Ffolliott (but it was, I think, the hurry and bustle
of the journey). It was his "perfect ease" Miss Poster said she
admired so much.
To my intense horror, I found that owing to Mr. Binks's fearful
it
5,
weight he couldn't jump off the Prison Wall on to Harvey Duff's
back, for fear (as the great man put it) of transforming Harvey Duff
into a poached egfj. I was, therefore, requested to change clothes
with this monster, inside the Prison Walls, and spring upon Harvey
Duff myself. This, on the top of that dreadful revolving scene
(where Ihave to hang half out of window, and tip a carpenter half-
a-crown never to let go of my leg all the while the scene changes)
almost collapsed me. I am no athlete, my dear Duchess, and I really
felt I must give it all up if, as a necessary part of what I had
understood was Art, I am expected to jump over walls, fire guns,
t'ump down from heights, take headers on to badly-stuffed feather-
leds, and so forth. But it was too late to give in now, and so I had
to practise the jump. I was more than disappointed in Binks; he
must have weighed at least twenty stone, and he didn't remind me
at all of Mr. Dion Boucicault. I found out subsequently—quite
by accident—that he owed Miss Poster five pounds, and was
working it off." He worked me off the wall by pushing me in the
back, so that I came down on Harvey Duff unexpectedly, which
oaused him a good deal of uneasiness later on.
The young lady who played my sweetheart behaved very badly—
she got up suddenly from a bench, and it tipped over with Father
1 Ionian and a glass of toast-and-water which was meant to represent
whiskey. She stood so much in front of me I was forced to push
her aside. Her excuse was (for I reported her to Miss Poster) that
she had heard of the death of her Aunt, and had "the toothache."
The costumes were funny—but I did succeed in persuading Mr.
Garrick not to dress Father Doulan in a mackintosh. I said I
would go myself into the store-room, and try to find something more
suitable. I succeeded in getting an old black cloth, used for Juliet's
coffin, which I draped round him to some effect. When the toast-
and-water was spilt all over him he regretted the mackintosh, he
said! Kathleen Mavourneen ended about ten minutes past twelve,
but Lady Aweberry stayed out nobly to the end.

Thursday moraine saw us rehearsing Hamlet the Dane. (I think
I am getting- excellent training for a sort of "WooDrN entertain-
ment"—a few minutes behind a screen, and "Now you have Joe
Tinkle the Railway Porter," and that sort of thing.) Mr. Der-
wentwater was really very funny as Hamlet. He considers that
"Bill 8hakspeare" meant 'Amlet to be a "Low Comedy Mer-
chant," he says'—and a very humorous reading he gave us of the
Prince of Denmark.
Saturday was "A Great Popular Night," so the bills said.
British Born is very much on the lines of Right is Might: or, The
Maiden's Prayer. I was the British Consul at Demerara: I am
always followed about by "Fagoles," the Low Comedian, and I
save George Seymour, the hero of the piece, from being shot by Don
Andre de Something, by enveloping him in the Union Jack, which
Faoglks has most conveniently got concealed up his back. This is
the great situation of the play.
In Dred I was quite black, and had only to say, "Oh, Massa, me
no do dat; me pray for Massa." But, as Massa" seemed to wish
me to obey his orders, and not pray, I got thrashed all through the
Eiece, till " Massa " is shot by Dred, which I confess I think rather
ard lines, after the way I must have worried him all his life.
Dinner at Lady Aweberry's to-night has been a treat. I kept
looking at wonderful Miss Poster, and thinking, " Dear me, if our
calm, dignified old hostess only knew what a week we've had of it!"
But we don't tell everybody. Lady A. was very pleased at her visit
to the Theatre Royal, Shell ford, and is coming again. And " I'm to
have a salary, Duchess, I'm to have a salary"—(new version of
Tennyson's May Queen,—" Call me early, mother dear," &c). I
think I shall get on with Miss Poster. She is a very clever woman!
I hope you won't think I'm becoming dreadfully vulgar! But I
like you to know things as they are, and it will interest you, I am
sure, to know how those who have chosen to practise this Art as a
profession work at playing without any playing at work, and how
they begin at the beginning, and how—ah! there it is!—how will it
end? We're not all Irvtngs and Kendals, and soon. Wish we
! Yours, Hugo de B***.
A CERTAIN YET UNCERTAIN CURTAIN.
Oub newest Theatre announoes (among other attractions) the pos-
session of an iron Curtain, worked by hydraulio machinery. This is
a most valuable histrionic acquisition. Among its various merits we
have discovered the following :—
1. Should the water freeze in the cylinders, the Curtain will not
be able to go up or down.
2. Should the machinery stick, it will be impossible to raise the
Curtain, and the current piece will have to be played in the lobbies.
3. Should the Manager come forward to make a speech, and the
Curtain suddenly descend, the Manager's speeoh will be cut off
abruptly.
4. Should a fire occur, the audience will be effectually prevented
from using the Stage exits.
5. Should a fire occur, the Actors will equally be prevented from
using the exits of the Auditorium.
6. Should a piece prove a disastrous failure, the lowering of the
Curtain will prevent the execrations of the spectators from reaching
the Stage.
7. Should London be in a state of siege, the Manager can easily
render himself bullet-proof.
8. Should the Orchestra play out of tune, the Company can always
be spared unnecessary torture between the Acts.
9. Should old iron rise in the market, the Curtain can be disposed
of at a fair profit.
10. Should old iron fall in the market, the Curtain can always be
lowered, possibly at a fair profit.
These are advantages for which we have long hoped and prayed.
"That'a a regular London proverb," said Mrs. Ramsbotham: "I
mean 'People who live in Glasshouse Street shouldn't throw stones.'
I turned out of Regent Street the other day, and actually found my-
self in Glasshouse Street. No stones were being thrown, I'm glad
to say."

Match-making! Ah, it does seem strange
If all our occupation's ended,
If never more we shall arrange,
That man and maiden be befriended,
By kindly sympathetic souls,
"Who like to bring young hearts together;
Just as an office now controls,
On paper, changes of the weather.
Young girls we see are often shy,
And men we know are often stupid,
How charming then it is to try
And make them feel the darts of Cupid.
We know that Edwin longs to woo,
And Angelina will not tarry,
How sweet to make their dream come true,
And see they ultimately marry.
There is no fairer task in life
Than seeing with a soul prophetio
How man must always choose a wife;
And since the Ladies are mimetic,
They sometimes choose too, and then man
Must yield, or else he '11 rue full surely.
Thus, ever since the world began
The woman rules the roast securely.
Believe us that our role will last,
Applauded in all future ages,
We did good service in the past,
As witnessed by historic pages.
Match-making Kings we've often seen
Their daughters teach to conquer shy men,
And many a matrimonial Queen
Has held the nuptial torch for Hymen.
The Stock Exchange in Danger.
A Cabman was, the other day, brought

Exchange Gentlemen. Sir Thomas said," If
he were a Cabman, he would not stop on
account of these knots of Gentlemen, but
would drive on and disperse them." Let us
hope this advice will be acted upon with due
caution, or it may be a bad job for Stock-
jobbers, and Stock-brokers may get broken
if this principle is thoroughly carried out.
After these words of Civio wisdom, probably
the Accident Insurance Companies will
charge special rates for the insurance of
members of the Stock Exchange.

PHILIPPE CHEZ ALPHONSE.
(Leaves from a Pretender's Note-Book.)
First Leaf—a Fly One.—Kind and considerate of Alphonse, after
all, to remember we are cousins, though the Almanack de Gotha only
knows what "remove" he can be. And he's been a Pretender
himself, and knows what a helping hand is to a fellow in that
position. It's such a tremendous pull to be recognised, when every-
body about you is making believe you are only plain Mr. Philippe
Orleans, ex-Colonel of Cavalry, and innocent Author of a big book
about America. It will pose me to be received at a real Bourbon
Court; and I can turn round to France, and say, "There, you see;
there's the kind of prestige your Philippe Sept would bring you;
look at Grevy's poor relations, in comparison." And then ne had
promised to show me a few of those practical Kingly dodges, a sort
of Macchiavellian Prince in a guillotine collar—of which, unhappily,
I have no experience.
Second Leaf—a Rose One.—How wise I was to come! The little
demonstration at the Station wasn't altogether everything a loyal
Frenchman could wish, but the newspapers have been full of me ever
since, and, if truth must be spoken, they had recently contracted a
horrid habit of altogether ignoring me. There was that unpleasant
anecdote of Atjrelien Scholl going about: "Comte de Paris f
Connais pas"—and it was a distinct relief to have sentinels pre-
senting arms, and station-masters putting on white gloves and
cravats, and the red carpet laid down at Madrid, and a live King to
kiss one on the platform! I am remembering all my nice courtly
ways; the Grandees are delightful, and the Queen isn't a bit jealous
of the Comtesse.
Third Leaf—a Sere One.—But oh, that Cabinet Council, at which I
was allowed to assist, to see how it's done! Alphonso's a plucky
little fellow, but he really didn't look like anybody worth mentioning
in the midst of his Ministers; and when he emitted that idea of an
English alliance against the forces of Socialism, Sagasta openly told
him he hoped His Majesty would remember they had met to talk
common sense. And then two conspiracies discovered the day before,
and the Queen has a headache in her bedroom because we looked
twice through the opera-glass at the ballet last night.
Fourth Leaf—a Yellow One.—Ah, now, par exemple.' Twocrisises
in one day: and we mustn't go to Granada because the faithful bom-
bardiers are likely to throw shells at their Sovereign, and Montpen-
sieh, my own father-in-law, is supposed to be plotting with Canovas
Castillo, while Zorilla is said to be waiting at the frontier with
dynamite. Alphonso says this is nothing—only the ordinary oourse
of things; but
Fifth Leaf—a Fallen One.—But I think I '11 remain Pretender just
a little while longer; and I wouldn't mind saying good-bye to
Alphonso and Spain if there were a port or frontier town where
they're not prone to shooting Princes. I really wish those Paris
papers wouldn't make such a noise about my being here. Why can't

THE NOTE-BOOK OF A DETECTIVE JOURNALIST.
Attendance at a Cabinet Council in a Statesman's Collabs.
Immediately I received the Editor's telegram, "Assume any dis-
guise you please, but, without fail, find out what is going to appear
in the Queen's Speech," I decided upon a course of action. Once
again I had to make myself up—this time I had to appear in the
character of one of the most eminent men of the century. Mistaken
for the Pbemieb, I would be admitted to Downing Street—to the
Inner Chamber.
Fortunately, it was perfectly easy to carry out my plan. All I
had to do was to adopt an ordinary—a very ordinary—morning cos-
tume, and a pair of gigantic collars. I was safe from recognition—
my head was entirely hidden in the collars.
I walked to Downing Street, and knocked at the door of the
Pbemieb's residence. It was immediately opened by a bowing and
smiling Messenger.
"In future. Sir, you will be able to gain admission more expe-
ditiously. I have been desired to give you this little packet, and
to say that the article it contains is again returned to you, on con-
dition that you promise to make no more evening excursions to listen
to what she said you called ' The Cry of Outcast London.'"
The Messenger handed me a packet.
"I think I ought to tell you, Sir," continued the Official, "that
there seemed to be an impression that you and Sir Chables and Mr.
Bbight are in the habit of seeking for ' the Cry' at the Canterbury,
the Oxford, and kindred places of public amusement."
I now opened the packet. It contained a latch-key. Preceded by
the Messenger, I ascended a flight of Stairs, and found myself in the
Saloon devoted to the holding of Cabinet Councils. Here the Mes-
senger bowed, and left me.
It was a plainly-furnished apartment, containing a long table
covered with green baize, which was surrounded by some dozen
chairs. Most of the Government were present. The Cabinet were
scattered about in groups. Here was Mr. Chamberlain explaining
to Lord Hartington his notions about the breeding of race-horses,
there was Lord Granville listening in rapt attention while Sir
Charles Dilke instructed him in foreign policy. Both Mr.
Chllders and Sir William Harcourt were drawing pictures of
proposed Ironclads, and attempting to attract the attention for their
sketches of no less a person than Lord Northbrook. In the back-
ground Lord Derby was telling Lord Kimberley what he (Lord
Derby) would do were he at the Indian Office; while Lord Kim-
berley, in return, verbally mapped out the policy he should have
pursued had he become Secretary of State for the Colonies.
The moment I entered the Ministers rose, respectfully saluted me,
and took their places at the Counoil-Board, reserving a chair at the
head of the table for my accommodation. Suddenly, the Lord Chan-
cellor entered the room in full-bottomed wig and robes of office.
There was a general titter at his appearance.
"Really, I see no reason for this merriment," exclaimed his Lord-
ship, angrily. "I was asked to come in this costume, because I was
informed, by post-card, that to-day we were to be photographed. I
insist upon knowing who sent me that post-card."
There was a dead silence. The Ministers seemed to be earnestly
engaged in doing nothing in particular. I could not help thinking,
however, that Mr. Chamberlain seemed ill at ease. This demeanour,
so suggestive of guilt, also appeared to attract the attention of Lord
Selborne, who was on the point of addressing the President of the
Board, when I considered it time to intervene.
"I am afraid I must claim to be the culprit, my dear Lord Chan-
cellor," I said, from behind my collars, in the voice of Mr. Glad-
stone, which I imitated most successfully. "It was only a practical
joke. You all know my playful waggish humour."
The Ministers seemed rather astonished, and the Loud Chancellob
suggested that perhaps, after all, the group might be photographed.
Impossible!" exclaimed Lord Gbanville. "It would be con-
trary to all precedent. We have hone of the accessories. We want
a number of half-opened despatch-boxes containing treaties, a few
waste-paper baskets to scatter about, overturned, in the foreground,
and, moreover, should all be sitting on the most uncomfortable of
high-backed chairs. Unless the Public see the chairs, the treaties,
and the overturned waste-paper basket, they will never believe that
the picture represents the meeting of a Cabinet Council."
Alter a little grumbling, Lord Selborne acquiesced, and took his
seat. Then there was a pause, and Sir William Habcouet rose, at
the invitation of his colleagues.
";My dear and valued friend," he began, addressing me, "we have
been considering what you said to us at our last meeting, and, as you
insist upon it so strongly, we consent to the insertion of that joke of
yours about jam satis m the initial paragraph."
_" I only objected to it," continued Mr. Chamberlain, in a con-
ciliatory tone, " because I thought I had seen it somewhere before."
"And I, because it seemed to me, as an old-fashioned person, a
little unconventional to make Her Majesty oommenoe her address to
her faithful Lords and Commons with a pun—although I admit the
pun was admirable in its mirth-provokingness." It was Lord Gran-
ville who said this.
"I am glad that you give way," I replied, from behind the safe
ambush of my collars, and then, wishing to feel my way, suggested
that I believed that there had been something said about Egypt at
our last meeting.
"Why, we spoke of nothing else," shouted Lord Hartington,
suddenly, exchanging his habitual rather gloomy calm for a demeanour
suggestive of the fiercest excitement. In a moment there was a
perfeot Babel of voices, in which I could only catch a few fragments
of speeoh, such as "Chinese Gordon," " Immediate evacuation,"
and 'Temporary protectorate." The contention waxed angrier and
angrier, until 1 was really afraid that words would give way to
blows. All of a sudden an apparition appeared at the other end of
the table—an apparition which tilled me with absolute terror.
"Before we discuss Egypt," said this apparition, which included
an ordinary—a very ordinary—morning suit and a pair of gigantio
oollars, "I hope we are all now agreed that the initial paragraph of
the Speech shall contain that little joke of mine about jam satis."
And the apparition chuckled.
The Ministers were perfectly dumb with astonishment. They
looked at me and then at the apparition. There was but one question,
"Which of the two was Mr. Gladstone?"
"I would suggest," said Sir Vernon Habcouet, timidly, "that
the Premier should come out of his collars."
"Never!" cried the apparition and myself together. "Give up
my oollars! Never!" At that moment Mr. Herbert Gladstone
hurriedly entered the room.
"Pa, I want to ask you a question," cried the youthful Lord of
the Treasury, running up to his parent, and embracing him. "You
won't be angrv at this interruption?"
"The true Premier has been discovered by his son!" cried the
Ministry en masse. "The voice of Nature has spoken!"
This was the last I heard, as five seconds later I was using my
utmost expedition in leaving Downing Street.
CLASS AND CLASS.
That worthy but slightly obstinate bore, Sir Edwaed Watkin, has
announced to the Shareholders of the South-Eastern Railway Com-
pany that "country clergymen, local shopkeepers, landowners, and
rich old misers have no right in third-class carriages." As Buch an
excellent authority cannot be gainsaid, we have prepared a table for
Sir Edward Watkin's approval, showing each class of carriage
which ought to be used for the carriage of each class on the S.E.R.:—
First Class.—Archbishops, Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts,
Bishops, Barons, Baronets (first-rate), Stockbrokers, Money-Lenders,
newly-married couples, Members of Tattersalls', Theatrical Managers,
leading Actors and Actresses, operatio Artistes, newspaper Editors,
Stage-door Keepers, Q.C.'s, Barristers (first-rate), Solicitors (first-
rate), Special Correspondents, Members of Parliament, Chorus Ladies,
Peers' younger sons, ironmasters, manufacturers, bankers, hotel-
keepers, housebreakers, swellmobsmen, pickpockets (first-rate), land-
owners, rich old misers, and Sir Edward Watkin himself.
Second Class.—Government clerks, City clerks, market-gardeners,
country clergymen (rectors, vicars, &c), local shopkeepers, prompters,
second principals, baronets (second-rate), younger sons nf younger
sons, barristers (second-rate), solicitors (second-rate), barmaids (first-
rate), estate agents. Ladies of the Ballet (tirst rank), innkeepers,
housebreakers, swellmobsmen, pickpockets (second-ratej, moderately
well-off old misers, and Sir Edwaed Watkin's chef, valet, coach-
man, and governess themselves.
Third Class.—Curates, dog-dealers, labourers, under-gardeners,
local sub-shopkeepers, call-boys, younger sons of younger son's
younger sons, potboys, hop-pickers, barmaids (second-rate), maids of
all work, beershop-keepers, Ladies of the Ballet (second rank),
Gentlemen of the Chorus, costermongers, housebreakers, swell-
mobsmen, pickpockets (third-rate), area-sneaks, policemen, soldiers,
sailors, and Sir Edwaed Watkin's scullions, boot-blacks, stable-
helps, and bottle-washers themselves.
By the way, Sir Edward Watkin asserted that, according to
Mr. Punch, wherever the South-Eastern went everything seemed to
perish and decay. In opposition to this Sir Edward averred that
wherever the railway had gone land formerly worth £50 an acre had
risen from £500 to £2000. Sir Edwaed ought to know that, from an
agricultural point of view, rot and decay are highly beneficial to land.
The Afteb-piece at the Lyceum [by an Impressionist).—A suc-
cess for Miss Anderson. Title and Play rather mixed. Comedy and
Tragedy (like Caesar and Pompey) very much alike, especially
Tragedy. A nice, crisp, little melodrama, just long enough to send
an audience home mournfully to bed and a nightmare.1 Like same
Author's Creatures- of Immtlse} unquestionably clever. Mr. Gu/bert
seems always at his very best m One Aot.

THE LATEST CRAZE.
{Letters from a young Gentleman of Fashion who " Adopted tJte Stage as a Profession.")
Mr dear Duchess, 28, Shrimp Street, Shellford.
It is indeed a world of woe and work for the Jolly Jack Puddings
created to amuse and entertain others. That dreadful Notice-Board I spoke
of now informs us that Miss Poster will take her first Annual Benefit on Thurs-
day, Mr. Garrick: (who you know is leaving) has a Benefit on Friday, when three
Dramas are going to he produced, Saturday is again a Grand Special Night, and
Monday is the Benefit of the Gentleman who supplies the soda-water in the front
of the house. Mr. Excelsior Mac Alpin I see appears in a variety of parts
each night. But I won't give in. I think by about the end of next week T shall
have appeared as everything—kings, earls, blind Jews, beggars, drunkards,
footmen, young and old men in every profession under the sun, and belonging
to every nation. It is also announoed that we start shortly for our Grand Tour
in the Southern District.
I asked Mr. Garrick to dinner yesterday, but, poor thing! he'd no appetite.
I'm afraid he drinks nasty mixtures, like rum-and-butter, or gin-and-bitters,
or tilings I thought only Cabmen took after being exposed to the wet. Mr.
Garrick calls it having a wet," so perhaps he gets wet first, in order to enjoy
these drinks the more. But he gets so dreadfully low-spirited after it. He is
our Low Comedian. But then that's a different sort of " low." I wanted to cheer
him up, and I'd ordered what I thought he'd like, but he stuck almost entirely
to brandy and pickles, which must be Fad for anyone. Perhaps this is the reason
for his not having succeeded in his profession as he deserves to have done, for,
by his conversation, he evidently is a thorough dramatic artist.
I hope to profit by some of the "tips" he gave me. For example, he told
me that country audiences forgive anything but nervous ilounderings; they
applaud the sentiment, and not the Actor; and thus, rather than "stick
(which is a sure signal for derisive shouts), it is better to insert such a speech as
the following:—
I belong to that noble nation whose proudest boast it is that e'en her meanest
subjects have liberty and protection 'neath her banner."
It does not the least matter what part one is trying to
interpret. The sentiment is sure to be applauded; and
in the meanwhile one has time to remember what one
ought to have said, or to " Exit"—it's a beautiful exit!
Miss Poster has let our Theatre to some Amateurs next
Monday, and we are all to go over to Seaborough to act.
Miss Poster has asked me to whip up all my friends at
Seaborough, but I have none. Lady Aweberrt has gone.
I went over there yesterday, to see if I could ferret out
somebody I knew. But no. I'm afraid we shall have a
very bad house. Nobody cares to go to the Play at Sea-
borough. By the bye, Miss March has a private lunatic
asylum there for Ladies; and Lady Anne Parchment
has been under her care for thirty-four years. She is a
relation of our family, and I think I shall give Miss
March a couple of tickets for herself and Lady Parch-
ment, that is if the latter can come without being very
violent. Yours ever, Hugo de B***.

And tell the tale to Bugoins at his breakfast,

VERY TRYING.
A Record of a few Trial) of Patience.
No. IV.—The Good-Huhoured Magistrate.
OBN PUMMLS Was
charged before Mr.
Bowers, the pre-
siding Magistrate,
with assaulting
Charles Short.
The Complainant
(who had a black
eye) deposed: — On
Tuesday, your Wor-
ship, I was standing
on a seat in the
Strand, waiting for
the Lord Mayor's
Procession to pass.
About four rows in
front of me was the
back of a man who
I thought was Alf
Watson.
Mr. Bowers. And
who is Alf Watson?
Complainant. He
is a packer at the
Stores, you know.
Mr. Bowers. Well, I didn't know, but I'm
always pleased to reoeive information. I hope
he 'II stick to his packing-cases, and keep out
of assault cases. [Laughter.) However, we
had better not interrupt the evidence.
Complainant. Let's see—where was I ?—oh, I know. Well, your
Worship, the man in front, who I thought was Alf Watson, turned
out to be Defendant.
Mr. Bowers. What made you think it was Alf Watson f
Complainant. The back of his head looked like Alf's.
Mr. Bowers. Oh, I see—a phrenological similarity.
Complainant. May be, your Worship. All I know is, some
people's backs of their head is more recognisable than the fronts of
their faoe. Look at the back of my head.
[The Witness here turned his back to the learned Magistrate,
and displayed a triangular bald patch, which created con-
siderable amusement in Court.

Amusement in Court.

Open Spaces.
Mr. Bowers. It would be as well, I think, to let the evidence now
proceed without interruption.
Complainant. Well, your Worship, I calls out. "Hulloh, Alf
Watson!" and I leant over, and touched him gently on the back of
his head with my stick—just so.
[The Complainant lightly tapped with his stick the ledge of the
witness-box.
Mr. Bowers. A rather striking illustration.
Defendant [interrupting). Not a bit like it, your Worship. He
tapped me like this.
[ The Defendant here struck with his stick a tremendout blow on
the ledge of the prisoner's dock.
Mr. Bowers. I cannot help thinking that that is a violent assault
upon the Court. [Loud laughter, in which the Chief Usher joined.)
Now I think we must let the case proceed without interruption.
Complainant. At all events, your Worship, I didn't hurt him.
Defendant. Oh, didn't you? Perhaps your Worship would like
to look at my head.
[The Defendant turned his back to the Magistrate, and displayed
a large contusion.
Mr. Bowers. Of course it's impossible to judge at this distance,
but it appears to me to resemble an extra development of the bump
of Philoprogenitiveness. However, I will hear your defence at the
proper time, Defendant: so please don't let us interrupt the Witness.
Complainant. What I meant, your Worship, was, if it had been
my friend Alf Watson it would not have hurt him.
Mr. Bowers. Yon mean—
some heads are softer than
others, and more sensitive to
the touch.
Complainant. Yes, your
Worship. Why, bless you,
Alf Watson's chump is as
hard as a brick.
Mr. Bowers. You call him
your friend — I can't help
thinking he would not care to
hear you say what you have,
about him.
Complainant. He don't
mind. He's here to prove
it!

Mr. Bowers.
Bowers. I'm afraid I
admit his evidence,
you see—the evidence
of a man who doesn't mind
being hit at the back of the
head with a stick, cannot
possibly affect the case of a
man who does object to it.
[Laughter.) But you really
must proceed with your evi-
dence.
Complainant. The Defendant turned round, and I said, "It's a
mistake—I thought you were Alf Watson. The Defendant, in
reply, said, "Oh, is it? Wait till the Show has passed, and I'll
Alf Watson you in the eye."
Mr. Bowers. A new form of assault, evidently. And what passed
then?
Complainant. The Lord Mayor's Show did. (Laughter.) The
Defendant then came down on me like a ton of bricks, as my eye will
prove.
Mr. Bowers. Ocular evidence. (To Defendant.) Now is your
time to ask any question of the Witness.
Defendant. Thanks, your Worship. (To Witness.) What's your
name?
Complainant. Short.
Defendant. All right. I '11 soon make short work of you.
[Roars of laughter, in which the Magistrate Joined.
Complainant (indignantly). I don't consider this a case for joking,
your Worship.
Mr. Bowers. You are right there; but I can't, in justice, rebuke
a man for joking, when I ve been doing it myself; therefore, I'11
adjourn the case for a week, by which time, I hope, we shall all be in
a more serious mood.
Biddy Flaherty, Molly O'Finnigen, Kate O'Leary, Patrick
Mulgan, O. B. Jabers, Thady O'Flynn, Dan Dunnomore, and Phil
Flanagan were summoned before Mr. Bowers, charged with illegally
detaining two bonnets, a towel-horse, a pair of blankets, a flat-iron,
two pairs of pattens, a woollen shawl, and a bottle of whiskey, alleged
to be the property respectively of Betsy O'Hagan, Katherine
Cork, Mary Munster, Paddy Murphy, and Phineas O'Connor.
Mr. Bowers. Ah! This is evidently going to be an interesting
case. (Laughter.)
The first Witness called was P.C. Job, 297 Z. He said:—On
Wednesday week I visited 4, Durham's Rents, the first floor of whioh
is occupied by all the parties connected with this case. I was called
in by the complainant, Betsy O'Hagan, who said

Mr. Bowers said :—As this case will apparently be rather com-
plicated, I wish to make a suggestion. I don't so much mind two of
you talking together; in fact, I can sometimes manage three, but
it's quite impossible tor me to understand six of you at once, especi-
ally as you are very indistinct, and this is a very bad Court for
sound.
The Officer again proceeded with his evidence, but the interrup-
tions and abuse became worse than ever.
Mr. Bowers (to the Defendant). Look here, if yon don't leave off,
I shall not only adiourn the case for a week, but I shall go on
adjourning it till I do get silence.
Patrick Mulgan. Yer Honour, bedad, I'm not going to stand here,

Mr. Bowers. Oh! aren't you? Very well, then, you shan't. I '11
adjourn you for a week, at all events.

Mr. Bowers. By all means. Consider yourself adjourned sine die.
Biddy Flaherty. Thank ye, yer Majisty. May you and Ould

[The confusion at last became so great, that Mr. Bowers ordered
the parties engaged to leave the Court, an order which was
not obeyed in a single instance.
Mr. Bowers. 'Well, as you won't leave the Court, I will; and I '11

AN IRISH CASE; OB, ERIN AND TALKING.
Honoured Sir,
ICH DIEN."
I am a widower with four children—this is my misfortune,
not my fault. So also is the fact that I am absolutely without
menial assistance. Yet again is another fact: viz., that on Tuesday
last I attended Mrs. Bunshaw's Agency for Domestio Servants,
whither I was directed by a Lady who "has been kind enough to
endeavour to alleviate my misfortunes. Like myself, she is solitary
in the midst of plenty of children. On arriving at Mrs. Bunshaw's
outer office, I was reminded by a smiling young female of some forty
Summers (without counting her Springs, Winters, and Autumns),
that five shillings was the customary fee for " registering."
Following Sir Robert Peel's advice, I promptly but not unreluc-
tantly did so, at the same time timidly inquiring for a Parlour-maid.
In return for my two half-crowns, the damsel handed me a ticket
inscribed as follows:—
TERMS—FIVE SHILLINGS
For each Servant required. No Alteration can be made in the description
of Servant booked for.
The addresses of Lady and Servant must be exchanged on partial engagement.
This Ticket Expires
Directly the Servant enters upon her Situation.
Armed with this domestio railway-ticket, I entered a long room,
around which were posted various groups of the gentler sex (not a
male among them), who, like myself, nad "booked for" Servant-
galism. Scarcely nad 1 looked round, when a stentorian voice
shouted, "Mr. Dionystus Jones," and I blushingly cast my eyes
down on my ticket, as three or four young women made towards me.
At the same time, I remembered that I was not a Lady, and that " a
partial engagement" was associated only in my mind with a strong
attachment or a breach of promise.
"Eighteen pound a-year, beer-money, and the usual Sunday out,"
cried a voice, in my ear.
I looked up, and beheld a slender sallow-faced young female, who
had evidently tried to make up for the skimpiness of her figure by
the breadth of her hat-brim, and for the want of blood in her cheeks
by the fiery hues of her ribbons and shawl.
"That seems a good deal," I ventured to falter.
"It would be a good deal for some people," she replied, tartly.
1 * How about the beer-money?"
"I provide the beer myself," I answered, firmly. "Are you a
churchgoer?" I added, wishing to turn the subject, not knowing
where the "partial engagement began or ended.
"Yes," she sniggered. "when it's cold meat on Sundays."

"No, I don't suppose I should,

says I ought to be par-
In less than ten seconds she was engaged in negotiations with an
elderly lady on my right.
"You're not a lode
_ re not a loaging-'ouse keeper, I 'opes, 'cos I 'ad to leave
my last place on account of the draftul 'ard work. Six dinners a-day,
b'lieve me. Fust at one for the old gent with brown kits in the
parlours, then for the old lady with paralice in the droring-rooms at
two, then for the newly married couple on the second floor at three,
then for the City gents at 'arlf-past five, then for Missus orff what
they'd leff at 'arlf-past six, and then orff what Missus 'ad left,
supper-like, for me—oh! Sir, it was offal. But if you're not a
lodging-'ouse keeper, I'm ready for the sitivation. My name's
Martha Crackles."
The speaker was a determined-looking female, with any amount of
cheekbone, a glance like a bull's-eye lantern, and a hand as broad as
a spade. Had I been a woman, she would have been my mistress, as
it was, I felt I was in presence of my master. My tongue clove to
the roof of my mouth. I was about to surrender, when an angel
(figuratively, not literally) came to my rescue, in the person of an old
woman, with threescore years, and twice that amount of feathers
pressing on her brow, who passed by us. My antagonist (doubtless
recognising h?r), without a word of apology, hurried in pursuit.
When next I saw Martha Crackles, Bhe had that old angel, care-
fully laid by, under her right arm.
A prepossessing-looking female, dressed in deep mourning, next
approached me, in a somewhat timid manner.
"I understand, Sir," she said, "that you 're looking for a parlour-
maid. I also understand, Sir, that you are a widower. Sir, I can
sympathise with you, for I am, alas! a widow"—(here the grasped
mu hand)—"and mean to remain so. My poor dear husband"—
{here four square inches of calico evacuated her pocket)—" was of
superior birth. He was town butler in a nobleman's family, but his
perquisites, Sir, were not of that commanding nature (owing to the
poverty of his employers) to enable me to enjoy that position which
is mine by right and nature. Sir, you have a feeling eye, and I well
know what sympathy means. {Mere the calico travelled to her eyes.)
The situation of parlour-maid is not one that I desire, but it may
lead to other and better things. (Ibegan to remember the "partial
engagement" clause.) And if one stricken heart can strike with
another, let that lot be mine. {Here she clutched both my hands,
and accompanied the movement with a sacrificial odour of gin.) Let
that solace be mine. I only ask twenty pounds a year as a solace for
my affliction. I only ask"
I did not let her ask anything else. I fled from Mrs. Bunshaw's.
My courage expired before my ticket. I am laying my own table.
The situation is mine. Try your own caff au lait, is the advice of
Yours joyfully, Diontsius Jones.

presides over a County Court," because that Gentleman prefers the
birch to the cane," and Ihe Evening Contemporary goes on to state
that, "if boys were consulted, it is certain that they would prefer
the cane." Would they? Not if they were wise boys. The cane is
an abominable relic of the Middle Ages, devoted to those of tender
years. The cane is a thing of much weal, and no end of woe. It is
an instrument of torture wbioh makes the punishment of years pay
for the fault of an hour, as witness, the enlarged knuckles, the
ingrowing nails, the scarred shoulders and arms of thousands of men,
who will Dear the Curse of Cane as long as they are able. Now, the
birch, even taken in the bud, tempers justice with mercy. It is
furious in its onslaught, stinging in its attack, resolute in its chas-
tisement, hut it is a generous foe, and bears no resentment. When
an Eton boy has been "swished, he is never obliged to carry his
arm in a sling, nor call in a Surgeon to bind up his wounds. He may
suffer some temporary personal inconvenience for a few days, affect-
ing both his chair (Fr.j and his chair (Engl.), but there the matter
will end (unless, indeed, he be "complained of" again). To sum up:
the cane is the weapon of a fool, often of a coward, and, maybe, of a
brute. The birch is an instrument to which the highest-born have
and may bow, for are they not brought to the highest legal punish-
ment—the block.

LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business.
1. To Miss Victoria Vokes, at Her Majesty's, ahout Lotta, at the Opera
Comique, and, 2, to Mr. George Orossmith, at the Savoy, about
"Falfca," at the Comedy.
1. To Miss Victoria Vokes, at Her Majesty's,
My bear Miss Victoria,
As your time is entirely taken up by playing Little Red
Hiding Hood, for which I see you are having extra special Morning
Performances, you will be very glad to hear from me what our
latest visitor from America, Lotta, is doing at the Opera Comique.
In exchange for Mr. Irving and Miss Ellen Terry, you Bee they
have given us Miss Mary Anderson, Miss Minnie Palmer, and the
above-mentioned, Lotta,—whether she is a Mademoiselle or a
Madame I cannot gather from the Advertisement,—but if you and

"They've been a 'tizing of ine."—Old Curiosity Shop.
your brother saw her, I am perfectly sure that the latter would say,
in his quaintly humorous way, that she is decidedly "not a-miss."
You would be charmed with her dancing and her grotesque attitudes,
and would roar with laughter at her eccentric movements, the like of
which I have never seen equalled on any Stage.
As to the piece in which she appears, of course you know by heart
every line of Dickens's Old Curiosity Shop, and, therefore, you would
fail to recognise in it any of the merits and beauties of that delightful
story, so utterly has it been hashed, slashed, smashed, and trans-
mogrified by its Adapter, in order to suit the requirements of the eccen-
trio Lotta, and, I suppose, American taste, as far as she is concerned.
It is true that you see before you the old Grandfather, Little Nell,
Mr. Richard Suriveller, Quilp, Sampson, and Sally Brass, but they
appear in very slightly-connected scenes, and thus more resemble
illustrations of character in a Variety Entertainment than dramatio
personages in a real Play. They are names, and little more. So
that of the Adapter, Mr. Charles Dickens, one might say, with the
old Clerk in Martin Chuzzlewit, "His own son, Sir! his own son,
Sir!" and with Mr. Stciveller, sing the poet's line, slightly altered,
"TiVTien he who adapts thee has left but the name,"
which I am sure strikes you as most applicable to this " per-version,"
as Mr. Gilbert would call it, of the Old Curiosity Shop.
You, my dear Miss Victoria, with your great reverence for old
familiar tales, would as soon think of asking your author, Mr. Frank
Green, to make the meek and gentle Cinderella into a bouncing,
dancing hoyden, or dear simple Little Red Riding Hood 'vxto a grown-
up tomboy, who fearlessly confronts the Wolf, fights and conquers
him, as have asked the Editor of Household Words to reduce Little
Nell to a posturing nonentity, and to have transformed the Mar-
chioness into a genuine " Yankee gal."
Lotta's Marchioness is a sort of white Topsy, which is a very
topsy-turvy way of dealing with the character, and when I quite
got rid of all the associations of this part with the original of
Dickens's creation, I thoroughly enjoyed, as you would have done
had you been there, Lotta^ extraordinary antics. You will be
pleased to hear, though she has not much voice, she knows how to
manage and make the most of it, and sings in excellent tune, and
tell your leader—no, I mean your Manager, Mr. Leader, what I
know will delight his generous heart—that in spite of the badness
of the piece, Lotta herself is likely to prove a very great success,
you can get a spare minute, do take your brother to see Mr.
id he will be enchanted to

witness the achievements of one of his evidently most earnest and
admiring pupils.
In other respects Mr. Wyatt is rather too serious for Dick
Swiveller; he would make a capital first dancing tragedian, if there
be such a person, and I don't see why there should not be a Hamlet
in a ballet as well as in an opera; suggest this to your brother
Frederick; he, as Hamlet, you, as Ophelia, in a ballet all arms
and legs, and no songs or dialogue.
Mr. Pateman's Quilp is a very clever performance, but not suffi-
ciently impish; if he and Miss Howard, who makes a charming Mrs.
Quilp, had only had a good song and danoe together, just as Mr.
Wyatt and Lotta have, and it the four had then all combined
for a jig, with Mr. Wyatt throwing his legs alternately over the
heads of Miss Howard and Lotta, it would have been more con-
sistent with the spirit of the adaptation, and I am sure that both
you and your brother would have enthusiastically declared that such
an ensemble must bring down the house, and ensure a run of three
or four hundred nights.
Probably the idea first struck Lotta of playing the Marchioness
in her topsy-turvy fashion, and then, having taken an inch, it
occurred to her that she might as well take a Nell. Certainly, she
herself is the greatest curiosity in the Old Curiosity Shop, and if
she would only get Mr. Charles Dickens to eliminate all tb.e senti-
ment, and call the piece The Marchioness, with songs and dances for
everybody, it would draw all London.
With kind regards to Brer Fox and Brer Wolf in your Pantomime,
I remain, my dear Miss Victoria, Your old friend,
Nibbs.
2. To Mr. George Orossmith, at the Savoy.
My dear Gee-Gee,
Which is, of course, addressing you by your initials as I
explained in a previous letter, when, in proper order, I put the horse
before the Carte, though you are the last man to indulge in any
horse-play on the stage. Thoroughly occupied, as you are, with
rehearsing, playing, entertaining, and various other employments
(for I have heard it whispered that you have the entire management
of a considerable small coal and potato warehouse in the neighbour-
hood of Covent Garden, to which you give your attention when not
assisting the Editor of the Quarterly Review, or making notes for
the Astronomer Royal in Greenwich Observatory), you have not been
able to gratify the one desire of your heart, which is, as you told me,
when Messrs. Gilbert and Sullivan were well out of hearing, to see
Falka at the Comedy Theatre, and as you asked me to go, I went,
and I will now tell you all about it.
It is the very sort of piece you would enjoy, not depending on the
comicality, or even the singing of one person, but on the united
efforts of one of the best comio operatic companies that have been
seen in London for some considerable time. Had you been in the
Stalls with me, there would have been no holding you, so supremely
delighted would you have been with the dry drollery of Mr. Harry
Paulton, the comic idiocy of Mr. Kelleheb, the eccentricity of
Mr. Ashley, the hopeless absurdity of Mr. Penley, the laughable

burlesque-style of Mr. Hamilton, and the careful character-acting
of Mr. James Francis; and if Miss Leonora Braham had been
seated with us, she would have been in raptures with the singing
and acting of Miss Violet Cameron, and the dashing appearance
and artistic vocalisation of Miss Wadman. There are plenty of small
parts, all with more or less singing and speaking, and all satisfac-
torily played.
Sir Arthur Sullivan would be pleased with the musio by

occasionally for lack of originality, and here and there detect a few
phrases which, it might occur to him. he had heard somewhere before.
You know, my dear Gee-Qee, what good Btage management is,
having been so well stage-managed yourself, and your Mr. Gilbert
would not have sufficient words of praise for the permutations and
combinations of form and colour which Mr. H. B. Farm i:, author
and stage manager, has contrived to exhibit throughout the three Acts
of Falka. I am sure, too, that Mr. Gilbert and yourself will
thoroughly approve of the absence of all long speeches from the
libretto, and that both will appreciate the ingenuity of Mr. Fabnie,
who, as the action of the piece takes place in 1750, and the scene iB laid
in Hungary, has enriched his dialogue with comic but direct allu-
sions to the topics of the present day, both social and political, in
such a plain matter-of-fact way as cannot fail to be intelligible
to the newspaper readers of all shades of opinion in the mixed
audience that, as Mr. D'Oyley Carte will be delighted to hear,
crowd this theatre every night, and leave it thoroughly amused ana
delighted with the entertainment.
By the way, your sense of the fitness of things will probably induce
you to remonstrate with the Author of Falka for making Mr. Harry
Paulton constantly address Mr. Penley as " Holy Father," when Mr.
Farnie himself has carefully described this character in the bill as
"Lay-brother Pelican, door-keeper of the Convent." Take my advice,
and as you have nothing to do in the long Second Act of the Princess
Ida, just put on your ulster and drive round to Panton Street, and
see as much as you can of Falka. In case you should be enticed to
stay over your time, leave word with Mr. Carte, or Sir Arthur
Sullivan, or Mr. Michael Gunn, or Mr. Gilbert, to go on and
double your part, as I don't think you would be missed in that Third
Aot for once in a way.
With kind regards to Mr. Barrington, who, as I see, makes up in
this piece to resemble Mr. Bernard Becker, I remain

CHIPS AND SAWDUST.
[Lord Randolph Churchill at Blackpool, among other
vehement denunciations of Mr. Gladstone, declared that as
a Political Woodman he had given us " nothing but chips."]
To spend four long columns in slating the Woodman,
Like a farce in three Acts, is but tedious fun.
How blackly you paint him, vain, voluble good man:
Demogorgon, Domdaniel, and Tarluffe in one!
'Tis pure waste of pigment; you kick o'er the paint-pot,
And call your splashed canvas a portrait! Dear me!

How dreadfully wretched—or green—you must be!
But no, 'tis of course mere political jaw-dust,
You d never belabour Old Chips as you do,
Or wildly and fruitlessly " let out your sawdust,"
Unless you'd some practical object in view.
Bad names why insanely and shriekingly call so?
Why trounce and denounce, taradiddle and mock?

The White Elephant—we do not care twopence whether
he is white, or drab, or slate, or mud-colour, or black, we
prefer to call him white—has been as welcome to the
newspapers just now as big gooseberries in the dead
season. We are grieved, however, to see the following
paragraph in the Times :—
"The Elephant was unusually elated, and made several at-
tempts to stand on his head, attempts which were promptly
checked by his keeper."
Can it be that the " sacred " one is nothing but a stage-
player, after all; that he is not even a prophet in his
own country—though he may make considerable profit
for Barnum out of it—but simply a performing Elephant?
It is to be feared the Times nas let the cat out of the
bag; but we wonder who let the Elephant out of the
Circus!
Mr. Gladstone's Motto for the Coming Farmer.—
"Jamjam futurus rusticus."—IIor. Epod. Lib., Ode II.
SOMETHING LIKE A PLANT!
To quote from the "Literary Jottings "of a Contemporary. It
appears that—
"Messrs. Chatto and Windcs have in hand a new work by the Author
of The Village Life, Mr. J. H. Stoddart, Editor of the Glasgow Herald,
under the title of The Sagacity and Morality of Tlanit: a Sketch of the
Life and Conduct of the Vegetable Kingdom."
This is certainly news, and opens up, especially for that advanced
and select class of thinkers who hold that man himself is but a well-
developed, if not very palatable vegetable, a fine field for reflective
speculation. Indeed, nobody, who has a fancy for his modest salad,
can read the announcement unmoved; and to those who have found
themselves, after a little free indulgence in the apparently harmless
bowl overnight, not unfrequently consigned, the next morning, to a
sort of Stygian gloom of despondency, it can scarcely fail to come
home with significant force. That there may be some inherent vice
in a cucumber, for instance, seems more than probable ;—still, it is
difficult, all at once, to take in fully the conception, either of an
intelligent pumpkin, or of a badly-conducted radish. It is to be
hoped, however, that Mr. Stoddart will not leave the unsuspecting
housekeeper in the dark, hut give a good and clear character-list of
all the inhabitants of the kitchen-garden likely to find their way into
his premises. Anyhow, the subject is full of interest, and suggests
much. Why should there not he a link of sympathy between man
and the cabbage he eats? Is it that both have hearts? Again,
what hidden tenderness is it that forces one who gazes long at the
onion that has been much cut up, to melt in tears, and turn sadly,
but hurriedly away? These are psychological riddles that Mr.
Stoddart, no doubt, will solve. By the way, if he prove, beyond a
question, that the potato has a real eye for beauty, and that a head
of celery, if it only keep cool, is fit for anything, what will become
of the Vegetarians? They ought certainly to get hold of Mr. Stod-
dart's book without delay.
We are rejoiced to hear our old friend, Mrs. Ramsbotham, has had
a nice little legacy left her. She intends "to investigate the entire
sum in the Induced Free per Cents."

Mr. Bradlacoh has explained more exactly than before the tactics he intends to adopt when the
Session opens. He will not attempt to swear himself in before the Queen's Speech is read. This is what
he proposes to do:—" He should go to the House on February 5. After leaving the cloak-room he would
enter the House and take his seat in the part of the House open to Members only. After the Queen's
Speech had been read he might, or might not, go to the table; if he did, no one could prevent him. The
police could not, because they would be outside the door, and he would be inside. If he went to the table,
Sir Stafford Northcote would object, or he would not. If not, then the oath was taken and the seat
occupied; if he did, he (Mr. Bradlacoh) could wait till he had finished, as he had done before, or take
no notice of him, but swear himself in at once, and take his seat."
TEACHING THE OLD IDEA.
Yesterday afternoon the second of the series of the new and
highly successful popular lectures recently inaugurated by Dr.
Morell McKeszie at the School of Dramatic Art was delivered at
that Institution. As soon as it became known that the subject
selected was " Hygiene in the front of the House," and that it would
be handled by no less an authority than Dr. Rawltngson, F.R.M.S.,
the application for places was so great, that the one pupil, for whose
benefit the series of lectures had been primarily intended, was
instantly offered a half-holiday by the governing body, and every
corner of the room was immediately filled by a distinguished and
elderly audience, in some respeots even more miscellaneous in cha-
racter than that which had attended the previous leoture.
In addition to all the leading actors and actresses, teachers of
elocution and singing, vocalists, amateurs, acrobats, Peeresses, cele-
brated Military and Naval Authorities, Members of both Houses of
Parliament, and a large sprinkling of Provincial Mayors, prominent
places were occupied by Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell, the Chair-
man of the London and North-Western Railway Company, Pro-
fessor Stokes, the Beadle of the Burlington Arcade, and a host of
other more or less well-known figures not hitherto publicly associated
with the progress of Dramatic Art.
The Lecturer introduced his subject by defining "hygiene" as
applicable to the "front of the house," remarking by the way,
amidst a good deal of laughter, that although it was generally
admitted that prevention was better than cure, a great many
Managers failed to realise the method of producing a healthy con-
dition in their receipts till they had lost them altogether. The first
necessity of "hygiene" in the treasury was undoubtedly to avoid
cold. This could only be effected by packing an audience well
together, and keeping them physically occupied by clapping their
hands. Audiences, however, required some stimulus on the other
side of the Curtain 'to warm them'up to effort. A frost was, there-
fore, to be avoided. The wind might sometimes be raised by posters,
and the public might literally be driven into the theatre for a night or
two by violent puffing outside: but the secret of such a procedure
soon got blown, and the Manager himself, as a consequence, at last
only found himself left out in the cold. This' brought him to the
recently-developed craze for decoration. There was a very baseless
and unsubstantial belief now current'that the mere trappings of the
Auditorium and its approaches were in themselves'a sufficient attrac-
tion for the public. This was a mistake. Such trappings caught
nobody but the Manager. He might be left alone in his House to
admire them, but if Tie did this fie must put his foot in it. As to
the public, they would no more stand mere stuff and padding on
this side of the footlights than they would on the other. A splendid
dado was a fine thing in the right place; but he might lay it down
as an axion of " Managerial hygiene," that the more persistently and
lavishly the interior of a House was papered, the worse inevitably
would be the ultimate condition of the treasury.
The Lecturer then, amidst some uproar, proceeded to make a vehe-
ment onslaught on tfie folly of several Managers who had obstinately
refused to stimulate the "failing hygiene" of their respective
establishments, by a recourse to a series of original five-act plays of
his own, the dialogue of which he quoted, and the principal scenes
and situations of which he was proceeding to illustrate on a black-
board, when it was announced that the one pupil of the College, who
had apparently been at a loss what to do with himself, had just
tumbled down an area, in Argyll Street.
Upon this information being whispered by a distinguished Per-
sonage present to a member of the governing body, a vote of thanks
to the Chairman was hurriedly proposed by the Deputy-Secretary,
and—everybody present promising to come again next week and bring
some fresh friends with them—the further hearing of the lecture
unanimously adjourned.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [February 2, 1884.
A GREAT DISCOVERY!
Mr. Punch, Sir,
The immense amount of eager curiosity exhibited by an
excited and incredulous Public to learn the nature of the scheme
that is to accomplish what no Act of the Legislature, nor all the
benevolent ideas of the Philanthropists, nor all the wisdom of the
Philosophers has hitherto succeeded in achieving, — though but
natural, has been almost overwhelming. I will begin by saying
what my plan is not. It is not, then, a mere Utopian scheme that
the incredulous scoffer need turn from with derision, or the impe-
cunious spendthrift with contempt, because it affects not him. It is
not the wild dream of an enthusiast, but the calm development of a
philosopher. Like all very grand discoveries, Sir, my great scheme
can be stated so shortly, and so simply, that four words will suffice.
My scheme is " The Abolition of Kent!" I give your readers
time to recover their breath at this mighty revelation, before further
explaining its various details. Suffice it to say that I shall be able
to prove not only to my own entire satisfaction, but to that of all
other reasonable men, that my plan is as comprehensive and as just
in its application, as it is bold and original in its conception. I sat
down in my solitary chamber, at my well-worn desk, to consider the
whole matter calmly, philosophically, and fundamentally.
What is Rent? Rent is the result of a superfluity. It is a charge
made by somebody for something he does not want, to somebody else
who wants it very badly. If a man wanted his house, of course he
would not letit to me. Can anything then be more ungenerous, can any-
thing be more selfish, or more opposed to the purest principles of phil-
anthropy, than to make me pay enormously for this trifling accommo-
dation? Think too of the sad results of this very absurd arrangement.
What is the greatest nuisance of our otherwise happy lives, if not
from the very highest, certainly to the very lowest? Rent! What
makes us all dread Quarter Day? Rent! Its abolition, too, strange
to say, would not only largely benefit the many, it would also really
benefit the few—whom, to a superficial thinker, it would appear to
injure—by relieving them of a large amount of quarterly anxiety,
induced by the uncertainty of their expected receipts, and of the
possibility of hating to enforce claims, that to a truly philosophic
mind must be absolute torture.
What must be the agony endured by a son of Tsrael who has to
turn out his miserable tenant from his one miserable room, because
he or she cannot pay the miserable Rent!
What must be the torture of a sensitive house agent of Low
Church proclivities who has to sell up a poor toil-worn clerk!
What must be the moral despair of a professional philanthropist,
who never hides his light under a bushel when joining in a fashion-
able public subscription, at having to issue an execution against the
household goods of a poor stricken tradesman, or, with a profound
sigh of regret, to make him a bankrupt, because he cannot pay his
crushing Rent! _ All this poignant regret, all this mental torture, all
this moral despair, will be at once and for ever at an end.
Rent is the first difficulty that besets the youthful pair, Rent is the
last straw that breaks the bankrupt's back. Why then should this
miserable vampire be allowed any longer to prey upon all alike, on
the majority with the fangs of anxiety, on the minority with the
fangs of remorse?
In my own poor case, which I doubt not is a representative one, I
always feel a strong repugnance to this particular payment. Its
very regularity is offensive to me, I detest having to take it nearly
three miles, on a particular day, at a certain hour, or to incur an
offensive reminder of what I certainly have not forgotten. My
butcher's and baker's bills I pay with comparative willingness. I
know and feel that I have received certain articles of food that have
contributed considerably to my enjoyment; but what do I get, in
exchange for my Rent, of a tangible character, that I can handle or
taste or examine? Nothing, literally nothing. I must, of course,
live somewhere. My Landlord is a wealthy Peer, who has, I am told,
hundreds of houses similar to mine. If I and all his other tenants
chose to leave what he calls his houses, and no other tenants could be
found for them, he would be compelled to admit an inferior order of
persons, whom he would have to pay for taking care of them, and
preventing them from going to ruin, so that really I am, in addition
to paying him an odious tax, in the shape of Rent, actually saving
him in addition a large expenditure. Surely, surely, this cannot be
just 1 and certainly, certainly, it is most inconvenient to me._
Besides, Sir, as we learn from various sources of information that
the great object of all government is the greatest happiness of the
greatest number, who can doubt but that my philanthropic scheme
would achieve that desirable object in an eminent degree. "In the
sister country, the Law enacted, lately that the more Rent a poor
Tenant owed to his cruel Landlord, the more should he be excused
from paving. This, Sir, was, I need hardly say, but a very small
step in the right direction; mine goes the whole distance, for, with a
simplicity and a completeness that would, I verily believe, disarm
even a Land-Loaguer, I not only forgive all arrears in the past, but
abolish all rents in the future.
The head of your statistical department has furnished me with
some startling facts, from which I learn that the annual income of
the country being £585,223,891 17«. id., omitting fractions, and rent
being calculated at rather more than half of that amount, it follows,
that my philanthropic scheme would relieve the rent-paying portion
of the Publio of the very handsome yearly payment of about three
hundred millions of money, and, at the same time, relieve the com-
paratively small number of rent-receivers of an amount of deep
anxiety, of mental torture, of poignant regret, and of moral despair,
such as no pure philanthropist like myself can contemplate without a
shudder.
What, Sir, is a contemptible sum of three hundred millions of
miserable lucre, screwed out of the necessities of our poor human
nature, compared with the noble gratification of having contributed
largely, out of mere superfluities, to the happiness and contentment
of thirty millions of our worthy fellow-countrymen, the toilers and
spinners of our Native Land?
The first practical steps towards the realisation of my purely philan-
thropic idea, will be the formation of a strong Committee, and the collec-
tion of a large subscription for preliminary expenses. I have no wish
to push myself unnecessarily into notice, so I at once announce that I
should firmly refuse the position of Honorary President or Vice-
President. No! my best and only reward will be the conviction that
I have developed a noble idea that is destined to change the present
sad condition of things in this wealthy land to one of peace, of satis-
faction, and of prosperity. But, as of course it will be necessary
that an efficient Secretary should be appointed to mould the affair
into shape, I have no objection to accept such office, but, as I do not
care about mere titles of honour, I should refuse the name of
Honorary. Subscriptions may, in the first instance, be forwarded to
the Punch Office, Fleet Street, under cover to the Secretary of "the
Abolition of Rent Society, Limited." j T,1TOT7f..

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A Good Judge too.
VERY TRYING.
A Record of a few Trials of Patience,
No V.—Lords and Commons.
Lord Peter Beauehamp Majoribanks Chol-
mondehy Waterloo Rhodes, aged twenty, was
charged, on a warrant, before Mr. Tory Spen-
low, the sitting Magistrate, with obtaining,
by false and fraudulent pretences, the sum of
five thousand ]>ounds from Samuel Isaac Jacob
Moss, a Financial Agent, of Tottenham Court
Road. The case created much interest. The
Court was densely crowded, and amongst the
distinguished persons who occupied seats on the
Bench, were Lord Alfred Pat-chit, Sir
Thomas "Winks, and Mr. Gillie Garrick.
Mr. J. P. Corn, instructed by his brother-in-law, Mr. Poohphries,
conducted the prosecution, and Mr. Lewis
George appeared for his Lordship.
Mr. George asked his Worship if Lord
"Waterloo Rhodes might be accommodated
with a seat on the Bench.
Mr. Tory Spenlow (the Magistrate). I am
afraid I cannot quite accede to that request.
Its refusal, I am certain, his Lordship will
quite understand. If Lord Waterloo
Rhodes had been summoned on a trivial
offence, I should have been pleased to have
given him a seat beside me. But his Lord-
ship is charged, on a warrant, with fraud—
ana it is against all regulation for gaolers to
be seated on the Bench; and, as Lord
Rhodes is at present in their custody, I
could not invite one without the others.
The matter then dropped.
Mr. J. P. Corn, addressing his Worship,
said: I must, Sir, before opening the case
for the prosecution, ask your protection with
regard to repeated annoyances to which I
have been subjected this morning. I have
received, since I have been in Court, ten
notes, asking mo if I am any relation to
Mr. Grainey Corn, the popular entertainer.
Of course, I do not deny that he is my
brother—I will even go further, and admit
I see considerable merit in his performances.
But I object—I strongly object to be known
only as "the brother of Grainey Corn."
I have conducted many notorious prosecutions; I have succeeded in
getting many notorious criminals Mr. Lewis George {in-
terrupting). Convicted.
Mr. J. P. Corn. I must
object to being inter-
rupted by Mr. George in
this manner.
The matter then drop-
ped.
Mr. Lewis George
said: I think, if your
"Worship will permit me,
I can save a deal of
public time. His Lord-
ship has been guilty of
no fraud. A little mis-
take has been made.
Mr. J. P. Corn. Really,
your Worship, this is
most irregular. Mr.
Lewis George com-
mences with Ids defence
before I have even had
the opportunity
Mr. Tory Spenhw
(the Magistrate). 1 think
Mr. Lewis George is
only about to make a
preliminary application
respecting Lord Peter,
which I think I must
hear.
The matter then drop-
ped.
Mr. Lewis George. I was about to observe, your "Worship, when I
was rudely interrupted by Mr. Gratniy Corn's brother— (laughter)—

"I tell 'em my brother's
a Marquis."

that the prosecution having advanced his Lordship five thousand
pounds upon certain property
Mr. J. P. Corn. Which his Lordship never possessed.
Mr. Lewis George. Really, Mr. Corn, you mustn't interrupt me
like this. I repeat—advanced his Lordship live thousand pounds
upon certain propertv which he shortly will possess.
Mr. J. P. Corn. That's the question.
Mr. Lewis George. Pardon me, there's no question about it. No
doubt your Client, Mr. S. I. J. Moss, Fiuancial Agent, of Tottenham
Court Road
Mr. J. P. Corn. I notice Mr. Lewis George always sneers at
Clients beneath the dignity of Viscount.
Mr. Lewis George. These interruptions are most unseemly. They
would do very well in one of your brother's entertainments, hut they
are out of place in a Court of Justice. To proceed: Mr. Moss
naturally wants his money—he shall have it.
Mr. J. P. Corn. Upon what authority do you make that statement?
Mr. Lewis George. My own word ought to be sufficient, but (I
did not wish to mention it) I happened to meet at dinner, last night,
not only his Lordship's elder brother, the Marquis, but his father,
the Duke of Strand, and from what they said to me (in confidence)
I can assure the Financial Agent that he shall have his money.
The Prosecutor stepped into the box, and said, if he had the money
at once, he would withdraw the charge.
After a short consultation with his Lordship, Mr. Lewis George
said: I happen to have my cheque-book by me, and, in order to save
time and satisfy the Financial Agent—my principal desire—I will
write out a cheque for five thousand pounds myself.
Mr. Tory Spenlow said he never did approve of compounding a
felony, but the case of his Lordship was evidently different, and he
would therefore dismiss the case.—Phe matter then dropped.
Georgium Sidus.
Later in the day, Mr. Lewis George appeared before Mr. "Whigly
Jorkins (who had relieved Mr. Tory Spenlow) to defend the Earl of
Datchet, who was summoned for
wilfully blocking up the corner of
Hamilton Place, Hyde Park, with a
phaeton.
Mr. Whigly Jorkins (the Magis-
trate). Where's the Defendant?
Mr. Lewis George. He is beside
your Worship, on the Bench. You
nave just shaken hands with him.
Mr. Whigly Jorkins. Oh! Who
put him there?
Mr. Lewis George. According to
the courtesy
Mr. Whigly Jorkins. I dare Ray.
The Defendant must take his place
in the summoning Dock. The Defen-
dant was accordingly removed.
The matter then dropped.
A Constable having given evidence
as to the aUeged obstruction, Mr.
Whigly Jorkins asked if there was
any defence?
Mr. Lewis George. His Lordship
was not aware, Sir, that he had done
wrong.
Mr. Whigly Jorkins. I will not
insult the noble Earl's intelligence
for one moment, by believing that
he thought he was doing right. Five
days.
Mr. Lewis George. Surely, you would not imprison his Lordship?
Mr. Whigly Jorkins. I can only fine him about twenty shillings,
and what punishment is that? Five days!

The Earl of Datchet.

Police Courtiers.
The Earl of Daichei and Mr. Lewis George i
from the Court. The matter then dropped.

PUNCH'S POLITICAL CATECHISM.
Following the example of the Pall Mall Gazette, Mr. Punch
proposes to address a set of questions to Members of Parliament, in
view of the proximate resumption of their Legislative duties at St.
Stephen's. These questions, however, will not be confined to one
side of the House only, and will differ considerably in character and
object from those upon the successful outcome of which our contem-
porary so complace ltly plumes itself. The following specimens will
give some idea of the nature of Mr. Punch's Political Catechism:—
1. What is your conception of the function of a Representative of
the People? («) Subservient flattery; (6) Crotchetty independence;
or (e) some rational and mutually honourable tertium quid f
2. Is it your sincere belief that Hole-cum-Corner (or other your
constituency) is so conspicuously supereminent in intelligence, public
spirit, and magnanimity, that (a) what Hole-cum-Corner thinks
to-day, the country will think to-morrow; (6) the representation of
Hole-cum-Corner in Parliament is the crown and summit [of the
highest conceivable human ambition?
3. If you do not think so, how would you candidly characterise the
practice of emphatically and repeatedly protesting that you do f
4. What is a lie?
5. When is a lie not a lie? {This is not a conundrum imitated
from a well-known model, as might be hastily supposed. It is hoped
that great care and caution will be taken in answering this and the
preceding question, A candid opinion on this point is extremely
committal, and covers a deal of—political—ground.)
6. Does your idea of "independence" include (a) The right to
"nag " your political leaders at every opportunity, and vote against
your party on every important division; (J) The right to bespatter
and be-pamphletise any particular leader who has incurred your dis-
like, after the fashion of Mr. Iscariot; (c) The privilege of pledging
yourself to a particular vote, when sore-pressed at a public meeting,
and of casuistically wriggling out of it when put to the proof, in the
style of Mr. Fitz-Pendragon P
7. What is your opinion of the frying-pan as a weapon of offence
and defence amongst Gentlemen?
8. Is there any essential difference between striking an opponent
with a dirty kitchen-utensil, and assailing him with undeserved
abuse and insulting innuendo P
9. What, in your opinion, would be the solid residuum of fact and
sense, if from the ordinary party-harangue were deducted, (a) False-
hoods; (6) Foul language; (c) Malicious misrepresentation;
{d) Wanton imputation of base motives; {e) Rank nonsense?
10. Do you really believe that your political opponents—that is to
say, approximately, one half of your fellow-countrymen—are idiots,
or viUams, or both P
11. Do you not believe that anyone who really did think so would
be qualified for a lunatic asylum?
12. Is it not, nevertheless, quite common to attribute to honourable
and patriotic political opponents motives that would have shocked
Tartuffe, ana maxims tnat would have disgraced Titus Oates P
13. Apart from political life, would not a person indulging in such
language be looked upon as either a lunatic or a—liar?
11. Is imbecility or untruthfulness less disgraceful in a politician
than in other men P If so, why? If not so, is not the stupid
slanderer (in politics) as truly bad form" as any other sort of
abusive " cad " P And if all parliamentary " cads (in this sense)
were (as surely they should be) "sent to Coventry," how many
Members would be found sitting for that interesting Constituency P
Mr. Punch will be pleased to make known the results—if any—
of this Catechism, which he is sure will be as interesting to the general
Public as the more professional inquisition of the Pall Mall Gazette.

LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business.
To Miss Ellen Terry, in America, on the New Piece at the Lyceum.
My bear Miss Ellen Terry,
I hasten to fulfil my promise of writing to you while you
are in America, to inform you now things are going on at the Lyceum
in the absence of yourself and Henry Irving. Miss Mary Ander-
son, who has to do duty for you both, and represents Youth and
Beauty oombined (I hope you will take this as a graceful allusion to
yourself and Henry Irving), has made, as you may have already
heard, a remarkable sucoess in the statuesque part of Galatea, and
has now achieved another triumph as Clarice in the one-Act Play of
Comedy and Tragedy, which is announced in the bill as having
been " specially written " for her by Mr. W. S. Gilbert.
The scene is laid in Paris during the Regency of the Duo d'ORLEANS.
The exquisite oostumes are of the period of Lewis—Wingfield. A
chief feature of Mr. Hawes Craven's brilliant Bcene is a splendid
staircase, more suitable for what Mrs. Gump might have called
"Claridge's" than Clarice's house. It reminded me of a similar
arrangement of scene in Lords and Commons at the Haymarket.
Clarice, an Actress, virtuous as she is beautiful, is the wife of a
Captain d'Aulnay, who, to be near her, has thrown up his com-
mission in the Army, and has acoepted an engagement as an Actor.
The licentious Due cT Orleans, not a whit worse, by the way, than
those by whom he was surrounded, and not so bad as some of them,
has persecuted her with his, attentions, and insulted her by his
dishonourable proposals, which,
I suppose, would have been
considered honourable at that
period by the _ majority of
young and beautiful Actresses
on the Stage, when morals
were muddled, and Cardinal
Dubois was anything but the
representative of the cardinal
virtues. Of course, in our
highly respectable Nineteenth
Century, which is graced by
our existence, we are horrified
at even the possibility of suoh

Barnes.
things happening, and sym-
pathise as deeply with Clarice
as our great
mothers did with J
at grand-
chardson's
Clarissa. As Monsieur d'Aulnay, by becoming an Actor, had, ipso
facto, sacrificed his position as a Gentleman (wasn't this a curious
state of Society P), the Due d' Orlians could no more have accepted a
challenge from him than from his own butler; so the beautiful and
virtuous Madame d'Aulnay and her honourable, high-spirited, and
indignant husband, ex-Captain, and now Actor, conspired together
to entrap the Duo, and not only to thrash him, but, if possible,
to murder him; giving the Duo, however, one ohance, which was
that of killing D'Aulnay before D'Aulnay had time to kill him.
This might be called all fair in love and war—I say it might be
called so—for anything more mean, pitiful, and vile, on the part of
Buch a virtuous and highly honourable couple, I own I cannot well
conceive. However, the trap is laid in the house of Clarice, the bait
is a supper, with the addition of Clarice herself d croquet as the
sweet to follow, when the wicked Duo will get his dessert. It really
reminds me of the oonduot of the eminently respectable couple, Mr.
and Mrs. Manning, whose wax effigies are, I believe, still among the
attractions of the Chamber of Horrors.
Well, the Due Orleans, aooompanied by his friends, foremost
among whom is the Abbi Dubois, who, by the way, was at that time
a Cardinal, comes to the bachelor party given by Clarice, who has
led the guileless Regent to suppose that she has been for some time
separated from her husband, and is, therefore, a free and decidedly
easy woman: naturally the Duo, who professes profligacy, exolaims,
with the Baron Gondromac, in La Vie, "Vat a larks!" and is per-
fectly ready to take advantage, it must be admitted, in the most
courtly manner, of such an occasion.
Clarice sends her guests upstairs (I said the staircase was very
useful) to amuse themselves as best they can at gambling in a side
room off the gallery while she detains the Regent below, lures him
to a sofa, and just when he is beginning to pass the border line of the
most respectful admiration, and has actually olasped with one hand
the back of—the sofa, in pops Mr. d'Aulnay by the window, very
muoh as honest Captain Crawley came in suddenly and surprised
the virtuous Marquis of Steyne on his knees to the immaculate
Becky Sharp. "This is a trap," says the Due d'Orlians. "Yes,
it is," reply the high-minded, respectable couple. And then, in
order to qualify himself for murdering the Due d Orlians (a puffy,
heavy-bodied, over-fed, flabby voluptuary, in comparisom with the
dapper, active, spry, and determined ex-captain), Monsieur d'Aulnay
tears up his actor s engagement without giving a fortnight's notice,
and putting his Manager to great inconvenience, unless there was
an understudy ready at hand; and then the Duo, stretching a point
in his favour, consents to go out in the back garden and fight him,

Kcgent and—Caught.
on condition, however, that this little episode should never be men-
tioned to any one—except, of course, Mr. TV. S. Gilbert; and so
strictly has this promise been kept that though, as I understood
from the action and dialogue, dapper little Monsieur d'Aulnay killed
the elephantine rout in the aforesaid back garden, yet historians,
ignorant of this fact, have represented the Due aV Orleans as dying
of apoplexy four months after the decease of Cardinal Dubois, and
eight months after he had ceased to be Regent.
While the Duo and her husband are fighting outside, Clarice, who
has locked the door and window, and given the key to a doctor,
entertains her guests—who, tired of gambling in the little back-room
off the gallery, are now sprawling on the staircase and grouped about
the stage—with an improvisation which interests them and amuses
them mightily. All this time she knows that either her husband is
killing the Duo, or the Due killing her husband, being ten to one in
favour of the former, and they are fighting so absurdly near the
house that the clashing of swords is perfectly audible—they must
have been cavalry sabres or pantomime broadswords to have made
such a noise—and at last, when Clarice hardly knows whether she is
standing on her head or her heels, and settles the difficulty by drop-
ping down on to the floor, a loud sigh, or sort of a howl, is heard,
suggestive of a violent fit of indigestion, and we all felt instinctively
among the audience that it was the "bitter cry" of the overfed
voluptuary, and we were right, for the next second in again pops
through the window Captain D'Aulnay—his time is passed in
popping in and out of this window—and we all presumed that the
Duo had been left quivering on a daisy. He pleasantly informed
his wife that the voluptuary's goose was finally cooked, at which
Clarice appeared delighted; and nobody took any sort of trouble to
go out and see what had become of the Regent of France.
Now, as to the acting. You will at once ask me how is it possible for
any one to adequately represent the part of an intensely virtuous,
highly respectable, and honourable couple, of whom one, the wife,
plays the part of the decoy, and the other, the husband, the role of
a bully P A virtuous and respectable Becky Sharp is a contradiction
in terms; but Miss Mary Anberson having chosen the part for her-
self, plays it, and assumes the responsibility of the interpretation.
She looks it to perfection, and from a certain point of view, which
mast be her own, or she would not have selected the piece, plays it
admirably. I can imagine what Sarah Bernhardt would have
done with it, but she could never have enlisted the sympathies of
the audience as an honest wife; but the Actress who can enlist the
sympathies of the audience by acting as a Lucretia could but imper-
fectly portray the seductive caresses of a Phryne. Miss Anderson
sacrifices the Phryne to the Lucretia, and her consistently impossible
character is entirely in keeping with the utterly artificial ana purely
theatrical situation. The recitation with which Clarice attempts to
entertain her sprawling guests (it must have been the dullest party
conceivable) has been ingeniously devised and oleverly written. It
is at once the tour-de-force of both Author and Actress.
Give my love to Henry Irving—he will be delighted to hear that
the Lyoeum keeps up its old reputation, that it is as ohoke-full every
night as when you, and himself, and all his talented Company, with
all his beautiful scenery, were playing Much Ado About Nothing.
Hoping to see you again soon, and promising to keep you well posted
up in all theatrioal matters that may interest you, 1 remain.
Your old friend, Nlbbs.

HUNTING PUZZLE. No. 2.
How to Get that Whip?
VIYE LA CHIFFE!
{Notes on the Next Revolution.)
First Day.—The Government had sat up all night, until M. Grevy
declared that, at his age, he could stand it no longer, and would
rather resign at once, without putting by anything more out of his
Civil List. This brought matters to a crisis, and M. !•'erry s valiant
and concise programme, Kesistance, had just been voted, when a
deputation from La Chiffe demanded to be heard. "Washed or
unwashed P" inquired the Cabinet, who had pungent recollections of
recent interviews. "Unwashed!" roared the rebels, defiantly,
breaking into tho Council Chamber, and immediately proving that
theirs was no vain boast. Their ultimatum was concise and explicit:
Firstly, the municipal, or rather the pnefeotorial boxes are to be
esteemed private boxes, one for each chiffonnier; secondly, every-
thing in the loathsome shape of a proprietaire must till his box night
and morning with pictures, old chum, and bronzes.
Ministers consulted. On their return, La Chiffe was strewed on its
back all over the Elysee, and M. Grevy's cellar was void.
Second Day.—Informed of the fact that the Chambers had refused
to accept their conditions—relying on the assurance of M. Paul de
Cassagnac that he would pull them through—La Chiffe immediately,
though unsteadily, descended into the street, and raised the banner
of revolution—the largest rag in their possession, bearing the noble
motto: "Tout pour ta Chiffe et par la Chiffe." At every street
corner, as if by magic, rose barricades of rubbish-boxes and dust-
carts. Five Provisional Governments sat in so many wine-shops,
and issued proclamations in the name of La Chiffe.
Third Day.—The " Sorters " had hardly succumbed to the repeated
assaults of the "Pickers." when the "paper" dealers intervened,
with superior capital, and; by dint of bribery and corruption, pro-
claimed themselves a Constitutional Assembly. But the rag - merchant s
insisting on a Senate, it was agreed to toss for it over tifty thousand
litres of potato-brandy.
And at the nine thousand and third litre, the shadow of two cocked
hats on the wall dispersed the Revolution, which was already being
rapidly asphyxiated by the accumulation of rubbish. Governing
doesn't always mean removing nuisances.

""Oh, right you are!" says Jumbo.
Says Jumbo to Taoung, ." Last year they wept for me,
And now they 're running after you, a greater fraud can't be.

PLAYING THEM IN.
House of Commons, Monday Night, February 4.—Just looked in
to take look round. To-morrow Parliament meets " for despatch of
business," as Gazette, with (Trim sarcasm puts it.
"There '11 be precious little business despatched to-morrow, or
for several more morrows," Joseph Gillis says. Glad to meet
Joey B. looking well and hearty. Say so. "But, Lor!" Joseph replies,
"it's hard work that agrees with me. Been terrible busy last three
weeks arranging things. Randolph and me's going to see things
through, I can tell you. Wanted me to join the party. Offered to
put me over Wolff and Gobst. But think we '11 do better if I stop
where I am, and we play into each other's hands. Besides, Pabnell
couldn't spare me. No, Joseph,' he said, when I mentioned pro-
posal, 'we haven't so much grace and culture in our party that we
can afford to lose you.'"
Found Tennyson in the House of Lords also taking look round.
"Not sure I like it now it's so near, Toby, dear boy," he said,
glancing nervously round. "Begin to think I made a mistake.
Fact is, found I was no longer a Poet, so thought I might as well be
a Peer. Won't see me here often, I can tell you. Shall come down
now and then and read them Queen of the May," or "Lotos

ping. Besides, I know Shebbbooke would be taking my cloak in

Sir Henry Brand here, too.
"Sorry you are going to leave us," I said. "Successor may be a
good man, but you are hard to beat. It's like House of Lords
taking the orange and leaving us the Peel."
"Not at all, not at all, Toby," says Speaker, blushing. (Won-
derful how the young thing blushes yet. But he's seen a good
many things in the House of Commons.) "You will see a good deal
of me yet. Know I can't stand a House that gets through its work
between five and six in the afternoon. Still mean to have my chop
between eight and nine, and back again in a quarter of an hour.
Worst of it is, I know that first few nights at least I '11 be calling
out, 'Order! order!' as I rise to leave my seat in Peers' Gallery.
But must put check on myself."
Gladstone bustling round in high spirits and still higher collar.
"Never felt fresher in my life, he says. "Been awfully bored
for last three months. Scarcely anything to do. Had rather good
time last Thursday. Received four deputations, and made four
speeches in one morning. Just gave me appetite for lunch. But
that's only once in a way. Now life begins. Going to have lively
times. Think we shall see something this Session. Sorry you
wouldn't move Address. But genius and greatness are ever modest."
True for William, though I Bay it that shouldn't. Off home to
bed early. Shan't get another chance for six months.

It is a remark rather commonly made just now, that "Reform is

weather.

of Sir John FRANKxnf and his ill-fated Expedition, has been put
on short commons by his Physician, and declares " Sir Andrew" to

ANOTHER WHITE ELEPHANT.
There is a certain eminent Minister who, like another Barnum
has long been seeking for something that would render him famous,
and he has selected, as his huge White Elephant, the most gigantic
Municipality the world has ever seen. He has been at infinite
pains to persuade incredulous Londoners that it really is what he
states it to be—a beautiful White Elephant, and certain members
of the Press have expressed themselves very freely upon the subject.
The Daily News says that although not absolutely white, it is not
nearly so dark as its predecessor, the Corporation Jumbo* The Times
says it would rather wait to see how it will look when well washed,
before giving an opinion. The Standard Bays that it is a gross
impostor, and the sooner it is got rid of the better, as, if allowed to
grow to his full size, he would in all probability prove to be very
dangerous. The Economist says that ne seems likely to prove a
huge, unwieldy, unmanageable monster, and certainly not worth the
enormous cost it will require to keep him going; while its three
faithful attendants, commonly known as the three solemn Leaguers,
declare, with all due solemnity, that it is exactly what it is repre-
sented to be, that they have fondly watched over it from the day of
its birth, that it bears all the marks of being what the Premier
would probably call " Real Jam." Its huge unwieldy size no one
can dispute. Its softness is emblematic of the heads of those upon
whom it is to be imposed. Its long tail is represented by the long
train of eager enthusiasts who are looking forward for a snare of his
cakes and ale; and its square chest by the mighty money-bags
requisite to hold the Rates of the future.
But all in vain; the Public refuse to believe in him, but pass on
to their several avocations, smiling somewhat contemptuously at the
large amount of fuss made by the eager attendants on both the
unlucky White Elephants, whose credentials they continue to doubt,
and whose usefulness they fail to appreciate.

GREATER LONDON.
(A Story of the Immediate Future.)
Tex Traveller had left St. Paul's for more than two hours, and
was still travelling underground in the direction of the hroad
Atlantic. He looked at his electric distance-marker, and found that
ae had journeyed some hundreds of miles. At length the train
stopped, and he was told he had reached the terminus. He looked
jut, and saw, half obliterated, on a notice-board the words, "Land's
End, Cornwall."
"Come, I have escaped at last!" he murmured. And then, to be
quite sure that he was at length out of London, he asked a passing
porter, "What is the name of this Station'("
"West Kensington, Sir," was the prompt reply.
The Traveller stamped with rage. Then he tore his hair. Then
he jumped into a train just leaving the platform. He found that he
had got into an Express. He tore through the earth (the line was
underground) for hours—perhaps for days. Onoe he fancied he saw
St. Paul's, but it might have been only a fancy. But on went the iron
horse, on and on. It came to a standstill at last. He put his head
out of window, and recognised the sea. Apparently he had reached
the Norfolk or Yorkshire coast.
"Where ami?" was his question.
"East Kensington, Sir," replied the Guard, touching his cap.
"We have only got as far as this at present. Sir. The line to the
new buildings will be ready in a month or so.
The Traveller foamed at the mouth.
"Can I never be quit of this hateful Metropolis?" he shouted,
and once more jumped into a just-departing train. This time he was
hurried towards Scotland. Most of the line was underground, but
now and again he caught a glimpse of 6cenery (covered with houses),
which showed him that he was travelling towards the land of the
Gael. At length the train was again brought to a standstill.
A Highland Station-Master opened the floor of the carriage.
"Have I reached Inverness P" asked the Traveller, alighting.
"Inverrrness! I There's jist na sich place!" replied the Official
with the broadest of broad accents. "Ye've jist come to Narthe
Kensington!" The Traveller shrieked. But there was one thing to
be done. He retraced his steps. And now he journeyed towards India.
For months and months he hurried on. Nay, his excursion consumed
the better part of a year. He felt the heat of the equator, which
gradually gave place to antarctic cold. Covered with furs, at length
e reached the spot, which was, he felt sure, the Antipodes of the
North Pole. As far as he could see, there was snow and ice, amid
things that looked like smoking chimney-pots.
"I am alone!" he murmured. "Still this is good—I havelleft
London behind me! At last I am satisfied."
At this moment he noticed a native of the place. The man was a
dwarf, and evidently belonged to some race similar to the Esquimaux.
The Traveller questioned this strange-looking person, but without
effect. The native spoke an odd sort of language, quite unlike any
European tongue. At length the Traveller succeeded, by signs, in
making the resident know that he was anxious to learn the name of
the place to which he had come. Could the native say where the
Traveller was? He could, and would. And his answer was the
last words that the Traveller ever heard, for they killed him.
When asked for the name of the place on which they were stand-
ing, the native replied, "South Kensington!!!"
PLAYFUL FACTS AND FANCIES.
Dear Me. Punch,
I was prevented by circumstances, over which I had no
control (I like to be original in the seleotion of my phrases), from
being present at the initial performance of Camaralzaman at the
Gaiety Theatre. The next morning I eagerly bought four of the
daily papers to learn from them some particulars about the per-
formance of the night before. I was greatly gratified to find from
the Daily Telegraph that "the story of the old Persian Legend was
told with admirable directness and point," and that the play "was
to all intents a Drama, well-constructed and intelligible to the most
careless observer." Glancing at the Times, however, I was sorry to
notice that the Critic of that journal was evidently "the most care-
less observer," if, indeed, not something worse, as that Gentleman
was forced to admit that the story " was by no means clear to his
unassisted understanding." Turning to the Daily News, the repre-
sentative of that admirable journal boldly asserted that "the Author
was loudly called for, but did not appear," an announcement flatly
contradicted by the proverbially courteous Morning Post, which
declared that Mr. Burnand appeared, and bowed his acknowledg-
ments." When Doctors differ, who shall agree ?—Yours ever,
A Puzzled Playgoeb.
What the Northampton Radicals Desire.—Zaiour-chere.
IRRESOLUTION.
SCENE—The Home Office. Tables covered with huge heaps of official
returns, from the Corporation, the Metropolitan Board of Works,
and the Thirty-Eight Districts of the Metropolis.
The Home Secretaby discovered, looking weary and worn. He
throws himself back in his uneasy chair, and soliloquises—
To be, or not to be, that is the question;—
Whether 'tis better for awhile to suffer
The harmless follies of the Corporation;
Or to bring on myself a sea of troubles,
Much easier raised than ended. To pass my Bill,—-
No more; and by a Bill, to say we end
The headache, and the thousand natural worries
That place is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To pass my Bill;—
To pass! perchance to fail;—ay there's the rub!
And in that fierce debate what Cads will come.
When they have shuffled much in that turmoil,
And give me their paws! There's the respect
That makes calamity of my bored life;
For who would bear the patronage of Fboth,
The oppressive candour of that proud man Beale,
The pangs of chaffing Dilke, Selborne's delay,
The insolence of Chambeblaln, and the spurns
My patient merit of the Premier takes,
When he himself might peace and quiet make
By mere inaction? Who would boredom bear,
To groan and sweat under official life,
But that the thought of doing something great—
That undiscovered thing, that seldom comes
To poor Home Secretaries—urges me on.
Though I would rather bear the ills we have,
Than fly to others that I know not of?
Thus, too, sharp Londoners, poor cowards all,
May think—if so, I pall in resolution.
Mv enterprise, though of great pith and moment,
Which none regard, and which seems all awry,
Loses the name of action.
THE RIGHTS AND WISDOM OP JURIES.
To the Editor of" Punch."
Sir,—This is an age of sham sentiment and sickly gush, and those
who were once considered—and rightly, too—the most practical
common-sense nation in Europe, have developed into a conglomera-
tion of snivelling idiots. Wipe out the name "England" from the
map, and substitute " Colney Hatch." One day we are maudlin over
an over-sized beast, whose departure from these shores I, for one,
rejoiced at; the next we are shedding maniacs' tears over the arrival
of an over-sized black king more hideous, if possible, than the
departed monster. Then we shriek over another enormity; and, as
if that was not low enough for us to fall, we select a lower depth in
admiring and adulating the British Jury. What next?
I may tell you candidly that I have the greatest contempt for the
British Juryman. A smug-faced tradesman, with no ideas beyond
the contents of his till, and his knowledge that his Queen's laxes
and Water-Rates have been paid, linked to a female whose mind
cannot extend beyond her brats and her servants' delinquencies, is, I
confess, no character before whom I can fall down and worship.
I will ask Mr. Charles Reade a few simple questions:—
Has he ever been wrongfully accused of forgery?
Has he ever been put on his trial for that offence?
Has a Jury ever found him Guilty?
Has he ever undergone eighteen months' hard labour, resulting
from that finding?
Because I Have!
But enough. I think I have shown, without any bias or prejudice,
that this present admiration for British Jurymen is absurdly exces-
sive and despicably weak. Yours sincerely,
A Late Inmate of the House of Correction.
To the Editor of " Punch."
Sir,—Mr. Charles IIeade's letter deserves to be printed in gold,
and I can heartily endorse every word he has said with regard to a
case of my own. I was committed for trial not long ago at Bow
Street Police-Court. At the Central Criminal Court, the Grand
Jury returned a true bill, evidence was dead against me, the Judge
summed-up strongly—even more strongly than the Counsel for the
Prosecution—for a conviction, and twelve honest men and true, with-
out leaving the box, found a verdict of Not Guilty. All honour to
them, and to Mr. Reade. Yours thankfully,
L. P. Loader.

VERY TRYING.
A Record of a few Trials of Patience.
No. VI.—Gambling.
b. Chinks, the proprietor of the Square
Club, together with the Secretary, the
entire Committee, and about four members,
appeared before Sir Jacques Inkem to
answer the charge (upon summonses) of
keeping, and being concerned in, a com-
mon gambling-house.
Mr. St. James Willner said: I am
here, Sir Jacques, to prosecute these sum-
monses on behalf of the Criminal Investi-
gation Department, Scotland Yard, and I
think it only right to admit that Mr.
Chinks and the rest of the Defendants
have co-operated with me most willingly,
and assisted me in bringing this charge
One of the Pack. against themselves. Of course, a charge
of this description is at all times most difficult to substantiate,
on account of the enormous difficulty in getting the Police the
entree to these Clubs. But, to meet this difficulty, Mr. Chinks
has come forward with a written statement, in which he honestly
admits that he permits gambling for very large sums, say thou-
sands of pounds. He goes further, and says that he makes
no profit out of the coffee-room, the kitchen, wine, and cigars.
His profit is made entirely out of the gambling. He has therefore
admitted, most honourably, what we could not very well have
proved. The Committee, who are oharged, are also here, and quite
willing to give evidence against themselves. There are also four
members of the Club, who, although Defendants, will support the
prosecution. The whole of the members, even those wno never
played, were really anxious to be charged. However, I could not

charge for the practice of this game is one sovereign the first hour,
two the second, three the third, and so on, in proportion. The
members often playing till ten the next morning, which, of course,
Mr. Chinks finds very profitable.
Mr. AVillnek then read every Act of Law and Parliament, from
the time of Julius Cssab, bearing on every kind of games, from the
Elgin marbles to Trente-et-quarante. This occupied two hours. Mr.
Willner then read all the repeals of those laws. This occupied
two-and-a-half hours. He then read a very recent Act, passed, in
faot, last Session, which he said was the only one having any bearing
upon the present case. He then called and examined one of the
Defendants, Mr. Cokeman.
Mr. Cokeman said: I was playing on one of the nights in question.
I lost eighteenpence. I have lost eighteen thousand pounds at
"Pitch and Toss," but never now. I never play now. I heard
these summonses were to be taken out, and so I played a little, in
order to be inoluded in the charge. I have made a statement against
myself.
Mr. Fusslc, Q. C. (tcho appeared for the Defendants). Tell the
Court, if you please, Mr. Cokeman—do you consider "Pitch and
Toss a game of skill or chance?
3Ir. Cokeman. Skill, most decidedly.
Mr. Fussle, Q. C. Where does the skill come in?
Mr. Cokeman. A great deal of skill is required in pitching up the
coin. For instance, I have a very big hand, and therefore a deal of
skill is required in tossing up a threepenny piece.
Mr. Fussle, Q. C. Suppose it falls on the ground. What then?
Mr. Cokeman. The members then make a rush for it, and he
who gets it first—keeps it, and ories " Collard!"
Mr. Fussle, Q. C. What then is done?
Mr. Cokeman. I pay him a pound, of which Mr, Chinks gets ten
per cent.
Mr. Fussle, Q. C. Is there any other skill required P
Mr. Cokeman. Not unless we play Turkish Rules. The skill then
is to toss up the coin so that it falls the side up you intend it to.

GIVING A "BAC."
quite arrange that, as there is not space in the Court. Many of
them, therefore, are on the Bench at the present time, while the
others have gone, I believe, to Monte Carlo and Nice, to collect
evidence. The particular offence charged against Mr. Chinks is,
that a game called "Pitch and Toss " was permitted to be played, for
high stakes, by him in the Square Club. I know that my learned
friend, Mr. Fussle, Q.C., who is specially retained for the defence,
will endeavour to show that this is not a game of chance.
Mr. St. James Willneb then read from the printed rules of the
game of " Pitch and Toss," and said: The prinoiple of the game is, that
a coin of the realm, say a sovereign, half-sovereign, five-shilling piece,
half-a-crown, florin, shilling, a sixpence, fourpenny piece, three-
penny bit, penny, halfpenny, or farthing, so long as it has a "head"
one side and what is understood as a " tail" the other (no coin being
permissible having on each side a head, or on both sides a tail),
should be pitchea up in a manner to enable it to fall on the table |
with either the head up and the tail down, or vice versd. Should the
coin fall on the edge, and so stand, it is claimed by Mr. Chinks. If,
however, it falls as before stated, the members are at liberty to
make a guess as to which side is uppermost, Mr. Chinks receiving
five guineas for each guess made by any individual member. The
Mr. Fussle, Q. C. Do you not know that gambling is carried on at
the most respectable of Clubs?
Mr. Cokeman. It is. Both at the Minerva and the Cannibal
Clubs. I have heard that the Bishops play Spillikins for cups of tea
at the former, whilst a gambling game Known as "Tommy Dod" is
extensively practised at the Cannibal Club.
Mr. Fussle, Q.C. What are the stakes in the game "TommyDod"?
Mr. Cokeman. Generally glasses of whiskey and brandy.
Mr. Fusslc, Q. C. Do you know whether money is ever played for
at the Cannibal Club Y
Mr. Cokeman {emphatically). Never! Never!
Mr. Fussle, Q. C. Don't, pray, lose your temper.
Mr. Cokeman. I thought the world knew that no member of the
Cannibal Club ever had any money.
Mr. Fussle, Q. C. Then pray, Sir, how do they pay for these glasses
of whiskey and brandy for which you say they gamble?
Mr. Cokeman. Thoy don't pay for them.
Sir Jacques Inkem, the learned Magistrate, here interrupted the
case, and said: He had issued all the summonsrs against the
Defendants under a wrong Act. Fresh summonses must therefore
be served upon the Defendants immediately, and they could either

THE EXCEPTION THAT CONFIRMS THE RULE.
Sir Peter {who is of a moralising turn of mind). "It's an odd thing, Lady
Midas, but what People admire the most in those they really love, is
the very Beauty that is most conspicuous by its absence!"

THE PIGEONS OF ST. PAUL'S.
[A Correspondent writes to a weekly paper, begging he may
not be thought a Vandal if he suggests the cleaning of St. Paul's,
and the abolition of the pigeons, which he considers out of place
on a Cathedral.]
The Pigeons of Saint Mark's may fly
Near all the long lagoons.
They circle 'neath Italian sky,
On summer afternoons.
The silent city in the sea
Has magic that enthrals;
But still you have a charm for me,
0 Pigeons of Saint Paul's!
There, 'mid the City's ceaseless roar,
Wren's dome its head uprears,
As it has stood from days of yore,
For twice a hundred years.
Below it still, hy day and night,
Each weary toiler crawls,
While round it wheel in endless night
The Pigeons of Saint Paul's.
You flash past pediment and frieze,
By summer sunshine kist,
You sail around the sombre trees,
And brave the Autumn mist.
You hear the civic stir and strife,
The City's cries and calls;
Methinks you scorn our busy life,
0 Pigeons of Saint Paul's!
What memories the great church keeps
Of all the great ana brave;
There Wellington with Nelson sleeps,
There Picton finds a grave.
And still at morn and eventide,
From out those massive walls,
The holy music floats outside,
0 Pigeons of Saint Paul's!
Your ancestors in olden days,
As ye fly now, flew then,
And heard how wond'ring cits would praise
The mighty dome of Wren.
"Si monumentum quarts," he
The Critic's word forestalls;
And bids you too " circumspice,"
0 Pigeons of Saint Paul's!
Although no tribute you may gain,
But what my verse can give,
Soar upwards o'er Paul's sacred fane,
Beneath whose eaves you live.
But hark! the clash of evening chimes,
And swift each shadow falls:
To you I dedicate these rhymes,
0 Pigeons of Saint Paul's!
elect to accept the service of these summonses, or be committed for
trial at the Old Bailey, or plead guilty, and be discharged forthwith.
Mr. Fussle, Q.C., consulted his Clients, and said, they decided to
leave the matter entirely in the hands of the Magistrate.
Sir Jacques Inkem delivered his decision as follows :—The great
point in this case is whether, within the meaning of the Act, the
game of "Pitch and Toss " is a recreation necessary for the health of
man, to enable him to better perform his duties in life. I must
reluctantly decide that playing (with only a short interval for
refreshment) from three in the afternoon till seven o'clock the next
morning, during the six week-days, and losing perhaps £4000 a
night, is not a recreation neoessary to the better health of man. The
next point is how to describe excessive gambling. Dukes and Earls,
and—may I say Bloated Aristocrats?
Mr. Chinks. You may, Sir Jacques.
Sir Jacques. Thank you, Sir!—Bloated Aristocrats—can afford to
lose £4000 a night, but I don't think Somerset House clerks and
officers can. However, this is your first offence, and taking into
consideration the social position of you all, and my unwillingness to
convict you, I shall not only discharge the Secretary, but impose a
merely nominal fine of £40,000 on Mr. Chinks, £30,000 on the Com-
mittee, and £20,000 on all the Members.
On leaving the Court, Mr. Chinks said, " I'm sorry I spoke!"

court, Mansfield, and Lushington.
PRACTICAL EDUCATION.
Dear Sir,
These is a great deal being written about the above subject
in the newspapers just now, and although I have not read one single
word that has appeared, yet the topio is one worthy of grave and
serious attention. The other night, at the Club, I picked up the
Nineteenth Century, a paper I had never heard of before, and which
seems to me to be singularly behind the period it professes to repre-
sent, as far as theatrical news and racing intelligence are concerned,
and I saw that Professor Huxley has been looking over his son's
examination papers, and declares himself highly satisfied with the
way in which they are set.
Now, curiously enough, while in the country at Christmas, I was
persuaded by my sister to look over her son's examination papers,
and more unmitigated twaddle I have never seen. The boy will be
rich, so perhaps can afford to fool away his schooldays. I am des-
perately nard up, but, out of deference to my parents, I had to fool
away my schooldays. I had to translate Tennyson into Latin verse;
I had to study Euclid; 1 had to have an intimate acquaintance with
the life of Hannibal. I wasn't bad at it either, but I ask you what
food has it been to me since? I can make no money by Latin verses,
can break no bank with a combination of all Euclid s problems put
together, and as for Hannibal, only one man in ten knowB who he
was, and that one doesn't want to hear him talked about. Practical
Education is a subject which must be grappled with, and, pace Pro-
fessor Huxley, this is my idea of a thoroughly practioal paper, the
successful answering of which would enable a boy to get through the

We have heard of weU-

songs, and make themselves
generally agreeable, at a
fixed charge per evening.
Though we do not remem-
ber toliave ever encountered
one of these bogus guests,
there can be no doubt of
their existence. The fol-
lowing advertisement from
the Daily Telegraph shows
another variety of the
genus:—

There is an unmistakably
business air about this brief
trade circular, and the ad-
vertiser shows no disposi-
tion to hide his light under
a bushel. One would very
much like to know at what
"figure" at which this
young gentleman, who
frankly avows he is "not
very fashionable, conven-
tional, or orthodoxical, but
still religious," would oome
and reside with us. Un-
fortunately he veils the
remuneration under the
somewhat vague phrase
"terms moderate." We
are afraid he would charge
more for all these accom-

afford to pay.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FHOM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.I\
House of Commons, Tuesday, Feb. 5.—" This comes of gallivanting
round with Emperors, Kings, Prime Ministers, and Poet-Laureates,"
said Inspector Denning, a little grimly, when at nine o'olock this
morning, as if delivered hy early post, Donald Cubbie appeared to
open new Session.
"Not usual to take Currie at breakfast now," Sir Geobge Camp-
bell said, sneeringly.
_ But this only Scotch jealousy. Last year, Macfablane, as men-
tioned at the time, provided himself with oatmeal-cake, bottle
whiskey, wrapped tartan round him, slept in Palace Yard, and so
got in first. Cubbie did better than that. Got into Post-Office
over-night, made himself comfortable, wrote Chapter of his forth-
coming work, Pranks with the Premier; or, Conversations with
Crowned Heads, and was out fresh and early in morning to secure
deathless distinction. Four o'clock early enough for most Members
to oome down, avoiding stupid ceremony of Commission. "If that
sort of mummery is to go on," Mr. Labouchebe observes, "better
have it done at Madame Tcssat/d's. Easy enough to pick out five
figures to sit on bench, and look like Lords Commissioners. Would
draw Public, too. Fine thing for Tussaud's. Perhaps it might be
put up to auction. Privilege secured for highest bidder. Purchase-
money to go in reduction of National Debt."
Royal Commission doesn't hurt anybody and may please some,
though not Noble Lords in comedy dress. More practical point to
consider absurdity of speeches in moving Address. Yernon, who
seconded Address in Lords, spoke only five minutes, and t' other Lord
who moved Address, was only three times as bad. But in Commons,
hour wasted in dreary business; only for Sam Smith's sword might
have been another half-hour. Would get between his legs as
he proclaimed his adherence to Peace Policy. When he paused to
abstract it, pinked Mr. Dodds who sat next Mm. Wanted Elliot to
hold it for him till he had finished.
"No," says that shrewd young man. "Got one of my own; much
as I can do to keep the hilt out of Goschen's mouth or the point out
of Habcoubt's back. Besides, remember you at Caine's dinner,
when you first arrived from the country. If you are once free from
encumbrance, you '11 go on till eleven o'clock. Never mind Dodds;
these publio-spirited men must suffer little inconvenience."
After this whispered colloquy, Samuel started again. But, what
with consciousness of knee-breeches, and struggle with sword, finished
in half-an-hour, to manifest delight of House. Then Boubke began
with Amendment to Address. Interesting summary of Opposition
speeches during Recess. But House really couldn't stand it. Subject
of crucial importance. Issue critical. Honour of England involved.
Safety of Egypt at stake. Opposition determined to die at their
posts in attack on most venal Government of modern times. At ten

minutes past eight, when Boubke finished oration, only five Con-
servatives dying: at post. Others, presumably dead, carried off to be
laid out in Dining-Room.
Debate about to collapse when Boubke sat down. De Wobms
rescued it; but, after gallant struggle, was worsted, and nobody else
volunteering, the portentous structure tumbled to pieces. Division
taken, and, amid jeers, it was announced that 20 voted for the
Amendment, and 70 against.
After this, Address might have been forthwith agreed to, but for
unexpected incident. Speaker put question, when there arose from
front bench below the gangway a youthful-elderly figure, and a
boyish face that nervously smiled behind imposing pair of spectacles.
(' Toots, by Tel-el-Kebir!" exclaimed Lord Wolseley, who looked
down from Peers' Gallery. "Didn't know he was Member of the
House. Looks as if he had been sitting on Florence Dombey's
bonnet again."
"No, Only One," I answered. "That's Birkenhead's inscrutable
joke. That's MacIver."
Nobody noticed Mr. Toots except the generous Wabton, whose
soul aflame with indignation at reoent discovery of fresh iniquities
in whooping-cough mixture, seized opportunity to expand himself.
Business done.—Bad beginning made.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Always had a strong personal liking for
Randolph. Don't know anyone who more charmingly mixes Ught-
heartedness of schoolboy with craft of statesman. In dull round of
Parliamentary life he is always fresh. No circumlocution with
him. Right or wrong, he goes straight for the point, saving infini-
tude of tune. Look at Opposition tactics that opened Session. A
long Resolution carefully prepared, and Boubke selected to lead
attack. Randolph growls and says nothing. Respect for pastors
and masters too deeply ingrained in his youthful mind. Rickety
Resolution dies of sheer exhaustion.
This happened yesterday. To-day Randolph comes down, and
brushing aside carefully woven webs of elderly Parliamentary tac-
tics, demands dismissal of Ministers. Others may "deplore" and
"Humbly assure Her Majesty," and what not. Randolph settles
affairs in two words. "Dismiss Gladstone." House roars with
laughter at freshness of idea. "Dismiss Gladstone," says Ran-
dolph to his Sovereign, "and call to your Councils others having the
confidence of your subjects."
"Who? who?" "Name! name!" House hilariously cried.
But this is not for Randolph to decide. With downcast eyes and
faint blush mantling his thoughtful brow, he says nothing. Every-
thing in order. First get rid of Gladstone, and Heaven will raise
up successor. Speaker rules Randolph out of order. Appears we
can't just on spur of moment get rid of Ministry. To-morrow, or
day after, perhaps. But not this afternoon. Randolph not to be
denied, so moves Adjournment of Debate.
"Has the Noble Lord forty supporters ?" the Speakeb blandly asks.
Dp rises every Conservative on back benches. Only ex-Ministers
sit, a serried row. Pretty to see Sir Stafford looking round to see
how things are going. Grand Cboss Sir Richard, tweaks his head
about, more than ever like inquiring sparrow. Evidently this won t
do. Tail irresistibly wagging head; so, after awkward pause, the
grave Gentlemen on Front Bench slowly and sadly rise, amid mocking
cheers from the Liberals, and Randolph is master of the situation.
Business done.—More Bills brought in than will reach the Statute
Book.
Thursday.—Lively time for Dodson at Question Time. Agricul-
tural Members get him in corner and bay at him about the Cattle
Plague Bill. Dodson lowers head, and runs at them one by one, but
hits nobody.
"Fine sport, though the bull a little too bovine," Mr. Gibson says.
"Why should a man, when asked a question, immediately rush at
interlocutor, and try to knock him down? Dodson always replies
to most innocent query as if he were in the company of sharpers who
had designs on his pocket, only to be frustrated by display of unusual
shrewdness and threatening snappishness."
Chaplin had the House to-night with Amendment to Address,
insisting upon fresh Cattle Plague legislation. Ministers had promised
Bill, which was awkward for Chaplin. They had given him what
he asked before he made his speech. But speech must be delivered.
Altered Resolution so as to express satisfaction at promised Bill, and
demanding for it precedence over everything else. Fresh attempt to
bowl out Chaplin. Heneage, with sublime young-man-from-the
country air, asked the Premier whether precedence could be given?
Gladstone, with surprised air, as if he had rather believed Heneage
was in Australia—couldn't imagine how he should be here with this
opportune question—fully replied. Not the faintest excuse now for
debate: but Chaplin's speech ready, and must be delivered. So it
was. Other speeches prepared for other ciroumstances, got off, and
evening agreeably wore away, finishing up with a soolding match
between Lord Mayor Dawson and Lord Claud Hamilton.
"Getting on nicely," said the Grand Old Man, as we walked home
together, his spirits a little raised by having dodged the Detective.
"Been at it three days now, and except for formal business, whioh
might have been done in an hour, no forrader."
Business done.—None.
Friday Night.—There being nothing to do, no question of public
interest or anxiety about. House devoted Sitting to squabble about
Orange outbreaks in Ireland. On the whole, a little dreary. Pab-
nell s comedy, in new character, as advocate of law and order in
Ireland: fine, but lacking in chiaroscuro, as Lord Gbanvtixe says
about Lord Salisbuby's denunciation. Don't know what that
means, but like look of word. Only real flash of interest, through
dreary evening was when Pabnell, reading extract of report of
Orange meeting, cried " Shoot Biggar!" Then House laughed and
cheered, and Joseph Glllis softly smiled.
Business done.—None.

GAIETY AND POLITICS-
OR, "WHY THE FIRST EGYPTIAN DEBATE SUDDENLY COLLAPSED.
It was the opening night of the Session. The Queen's Speech had
heen read, and the Mover of the Amendment to the Address had
nearly undisputed posses-
sion of the House. The
Ministry and most of the
Opposition were in the Tea-
Jtoom. Mr. Chamberlain
had made a remark.
"Not seen Camaralza-
man?" exclaimed the
Ministry en masse, while
the leaders of the Opposi-
tion expressed astonish-
ment.
"It is a fact, I assure
you," continued the Right
Hon. Gentleman, " I have
What
been so very busy,
is it like?"
"Bright scenery, pretty
dresses, and good music,
replied the Premier, "I do
not pretend to be a Masher,
but I certainly enjoy it.
Then I was very pleased
indeed with the book.
When I sit listening to
some of Mr. Terry's most
amusing allusions to his
existence as a Djin, I often
fancy that my translation
ne.) of Homer would be none
the worse for a few puns."
"Terry is immense in the part of Danasch," exclaimed the Earl
of Derby, " I absolutely roared at his mock flying in his burlesque
of JEnea. And so did you, my Lord High Chancellor, didn't you?"
"I certainly was vastly amused/' admitted the Earl of Selborne,
and then the Chief Officer of the High Court of Justice continued—
"but what pleased me most was the dancing and acting of Miss
Constance Gilchrist. She is positively charming. So graceful
and refined."
"Why, cert'nly," said Sir William Harcourt. "And you must
know, Chamberlain, that there is a capital whistling-duet between
Terry and Miss Nellie
Farren. By the way, the
young Lady I have just
mentioned is as lively and
pretty and clever as ever.
What would the Gaiety be
without its Nelly?"
"Ah, what indeed!"
echoed the Grand Old
Man, "and you will be
glad to hear, J oseph, that
Mr. W. Elton has an ex-
cellent part that exactly
suits him. As The Shan,
he shows to nearly as great
advantage as he did in
Caliban:'
"And is Squire in it?"
asked the President of the
Board of Trade, putting
up his eyeglass, and look-
ing round, in his search
for information.
"Of course," replied
Mr. Dodson. "He ap-
pears as the Emperor of
China, in a very clever make-up. And Childers (who was in
the next Stall to minelwas immensely pleased with Mr. Warde, in
the character of Li Kunnki, described by Burnand as a 1 Djin—
inferior spirit.' Weren't you pleased with him, Hugh?"
"Indeed I was," replied the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
thought his business with the oil-can on the engine, in the Second
Act, exceedingly funny. Then the music, selected, composed, and
arranged by Herr Meyer Lutz, could not be better; and Chase
morf/s dresses are in excellent taste."

"Is anyone going?"

up with enthusiasm, and a

RAISING THE WIND.
"If you wish," said Mr. Buskin, addressing his hearers the other
evening at the Royal Institution, "to see, in a hurry, what the sun
looks like through a plague-cloud, you have only to throw a bad
half-crown into a basin of soap-and-water."
As, under the circumstances, a little supplementary experiment,
in further illustration of Mr. Ruskin's lecture, may not be out of
place, the following may perhaps be essayed with amusement and
advantage by some of the learned Professor s more practical disciples.

Allow me to acknowledge the receipt of the following
communications. J. Likjue.
To the Secretary of the Rent Abolition Company.
Sib,—I sympathise heartily with your magnifioent proposal, the
more so as I owe a year and a half s rent to my grasping Landlord,
who absolutely threatens to deprive me of those goods and chattels
which I claim as my birthright as a true-born Englishman.
Sib,—After giving the matter full consideration, I prefer your
soheme infinitely to Mr. George's. The fatal blot in his plan is, that
I should still have to pay rent to somebody, to which I strongly
object; yours entrances me by its sweet simplicity. If you would
kindly let me know about what time the Bill for the Abolition of
Rent is likely to pass. I should feel much obliged, as I should like
to move into a much larger house.
Sib,—I have occupied my present residence for nearly a year
without paying any rent, under the plea that my remittances will
arrive in April. Supposing your admirable Bill to pass before I pay
any rent, should I lose my legal right to my house r
Sib,—Your scheme is truly admirable, but one point requires
clearing up. I live in furnished lodgings, and presume that my
widowed, but pitiless Landlady would not be allowed to remove her
paltry furniture from what would then be my legal and happy home.
It would be a great inconvenience to me if she were, and any such
attempt would, I should think, be regarded by the Law in the light
of a trespass upon my premises.
Allow me, Sir, to add that unless the Public reply more generously
to my appeal, I shall dedicate what I have already received to my
necessary expenses. J. Lrruuf:.

Dundreary's Grandson.1
LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business.
1. To Mr. Kendal, at St. James's.
My dear Kendal,
As they cannot spare you out of the Scrap of Paper, I write
to relieve your curiosity about Our Regiment. I thought it was
exactly what you would nave liked had you seen it, but it had nothing
whatever to do with The Discarded Son, alias The Queen's Shilling,
alias The Lancers, in which Lancers you were such a prominent
figure. If you had been with me to see Our Regiment, I'm sure you
would have gone into convulsions of
laughter at the piece generally, at
the acting of Mr. Gerald Moore in
particular, and, in the "Impulse" of
the moment you would have ex-
claimed, loud enough to have got you
turned out of the house, "Dear me!
Guy Warrener must be some relation
of Captain Orichton's.'" who, in his
own peculiar way, would have insisted
upon the resemblance, and have said
to Guy Warrener, "0, you are! you
know you are!" I have not laughed
so much for some long time as at
Mr. Gerald Moore's manner when
he first comes on, and when he appears
in somebody else's clothes as another
"Guy"
The Author, Mr. Hamilton, has
made his young Curate too farcical,
but it is very well played by Mr.
Gardiner, as is also Captain Fea-
therston by Mr. Lethcourt. Mr.
Henley, who, in Blue Beard at the
Gaiety, gave us suoh a striking imita-
tion of Henry Irving, was very well
made up as the disagreeable Mr. Dob-
tnnson, and played it capitally. The same may be said of Mr. Young
as the fussy old idiot, Ellaby. All the Ladies were good. You will
be glad to hear that Dun-
dreary's descendant is highly
appreciated by the audience.
Remember me affectionately
to your partner, Mr. Hare
Fairs, or Mr. Fair Hares—
I don't know which name he
has taken, though I know he
has done something to it by
special Act of Parliament—
and with sincere congratula-
tions to Mrs. Kendal and
yourself on the continued suc-
cess of A Scrap of Paper,
-I remain, your old friend,
and boon companion,
Nibbs.
P.S.—One of the great at-
tractions at this theatre is
the energetic conductor of the
orchestra, who directs the
overtures and the entr'acte
music entirely [oat of his
opera-hat, which is always on
the desk in front of him. I
suppose he composes it first in his own head, and then it gets out
of that into the gibus. It is immensely clever.
2. To Miss Violet Cameron, at the Comedy,
My dear Miss Violet Cameron,
You couldn't bepresent at the first night of Nell Gwynne,
as you were playing in Falka; but, had you been there, you would
have been delighted with Miss St. John's success. To quote the
Poet, "She danced like a fairy and Bang like a bird." I must defer
particulars till another time, and it must suffice for the present to
tell you that Mr. Arthur Roberts was immensely funny in a part
which is a sort of parody on Gasper, the Miser in Les Cloches de
Corneville; that Mr. Brough was funny as Mr. Brough, dressed as
a Beadle, with nothing particular to do, nothing particular to sing,
and nothing funny to say, except when he adjures everybody to
witness that their Beadle has been called an idiot. That this is a
bit of highly original humour will be seen at a glance by everybody
except a few ill-conditioned, carping Critics among the Public, who
will swear that they've heard something like it before, and may

"Ah! que j'aime les Militaires!"
have the malevolence to refer to the scene between Dogberry and
his prisoner, Borachio, when the latter has called him an ass.
That such a comparison should be instituted, speaks highly for
Mr. Farnie's familiarity or, as might be said in this case, his undue
familiarity with the text of Shaksfeare. During two Acts I am sure
that, even in spite of your great perspicacity ana remarkable intelli-
gence, you would have been unable to bet, with any accuraoy, on
what was exactly the plot of the story, or to have decided at any
given moment why somebody came in, or anybody went out, and
why, after all was said, sung, and done, it had ever been called
Nell Gwynne. Of course the evident retort would be—why not call
it Nell Gwynne f And on consideration you, with your strong
logical mind, would have immediately repeated, "Why not?" as
one name is as good as another; only, that, as a title, Nell Gwynne
is rather better.
You would have been amused by a Miss Reynolds, who tried to
give reminiscences of Lotta and Minnie Palmer, and I fancy that
after the performance was over, you would have gone round behind
the scenes, and, with your great candour and good sense, would have
advised her to give a totally different reading of the character for the
future. Just to brighten up the play with a little local colouring, we
had what I may call twopenn'orth of Charles the Second in the
last Act. But such a Charles the Second!—" Charles, her friend,"
as he may be called in relation to Nell Gwynne—he was well worth
all the money and more; he hadn't much to say, which was quite in
keeping with his historically taoiturn character; but he had a great
deal to think about, and a lot to listen to. To judge from his continu-
ally varying expression and constantly changing attitude, he was so
deeply affected by what he had heard that he was forced to run
through a whole chromatic scale of emotions, finishing on the deepest
note with his head turned away from the audience, as if the power
of histrionic expression could no further 50, and would require a
treble Edmund KEAN-cum-GRiMALDi's tragio and pantomimic talent
to produce one additional effect which should not be an anti-climax.
Of the music I will tell you in my next, perhaps, something of
the story, too, when I have found it out; but I rather think that as
my old friend, Lord Dundreary, used to say, "it's a Bortof thing
no fellow can understand." your8 trn]yi Nnnjs>
3. To Mr. Augustus Harris, at Drury Lane.
My dear Augustus Harris,
You will be grieved to learn that next Saturday will be the
last night of the Pantomime at Her Majesty's Theatre. Both you
and I knew how it would be when the Manager of that establishment
persistently quoted in his daily Advertisement the opinion of the
Saturday Review as to the
superiority of Red Riding
Hood over your Cinderella.
That was quite enough to
settle anything. The Sab-
bath-Day Reviewer had
said that Red Riding
Hood "was something
like a Pantomime."
Now, my dear Augustus,
if an Entertainment is
intended to be a Panto-
mime, it must be that or
something quite different;
but how anything calling
itself a Pantomime can be
considered by any sane
person as better than a
real Pantomime because it
is not a Pantomime—but
"like one" is the sort of
problem that a Sabbath-
Day Reviewer can have
his Sabbath-Day leisure
to think out.
They are going to finish
up well, however, at Her
Majesty's, as Miss Roslna
Yokes reappears for the
Publio generally, in the

Take my advioe, and after Easter drop your comic soenes, stick in
two or three new effects and new songs, and run your Pantomime
through the Season, and, with a few more changes, right up to Christ-
mas. I am glad you were touched by remorse for having sold tickets
for an Ash Wednesday's performance. Are you really giving up the
Stage, and coming out as Canon Shuttlecock's Curate?
Wishing you every success, I remain, yours truly, Nlbbs.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [February 16, 1884,
A STRANGE FANCY.
There is no accounting for
tastes, and it is impossible to
know to what length the vag-
aries of the young people of
the present day will lead them.
Look at the following, from
the Daily News:—
DAILY COOKINGor Charing
WANTED by a respectable
Young Woman.
Now why should this Ad-
vertiser want to be cooked
every day? Most "respect-
able young women" do not
care about getting into hot
water, and object to being
roasted. A burnt child dreads
the fire, the proverb tells us,
but this extraordinary damsel
is desirous of being boiled,
baked, or scorched every day.
She should however remember
there are two " r's " in " Char-
ring." Possibly, after all, the
maiden is merry and facetious,
and is only on the look-out for
a cheap Turkish Bath.

THE ISTHMUS OF
SEWAGE.
The proposed transforma-
tion of the Thames into a
Sewage Canal, and the con-
version of fifty-five acres on
its bank into an Isthmus of
Sewage, is at the present
moment attracting a deal of
attention. The aforesaid acres
are in the parish of Mortlake,
and the Vestry strongly object
to sewage-works being there
erected. They naturally fear
that the place will become
Mortlake by nature as well
as by name. The Local Board
of Chiswick, the Duke of
Devonshire, the inhabitants
of Richmond, the representa-
tives of fifty rowing-clubs,
the diners at the "Star and
Garter," the saunterers in
Kew Gardens are all vehe-
ment in their denunciation
of the scheme. The place
chosen for the erection of
works is alongside the Oxford
and Cambridge Course, and
will seriously interfere with
the handiest racing and train-
ing quarters for all London
rowers. The Thames is every
year becoming more valu-
able as a playground, and it
is to be hoped this vigorous
protest may not be without its
effect. Some years ago, the
efforts of a few energetic people
prevented the disfigurement of
the banks of the Thames by the
Waterworks at Ditton. The
present case is far more serious;
and it is to be hoped no pains
will be spared to prevent the
establishment of an Isthmus of
Sewage which will seriously in-
terfere with the aquatic sports,
the athletics, and the enjoy-
ment of our great Metropolis.

LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business.
To Miss Lolla, at the Optra Comique.
Mr dear Miss Lotta,
Mt Cousin Nibbs, having: split the 'seams of his coat by
laughing in his sleeve, and having gone to the tailor's to be
repaired, I venture to take up the pen, in order to call your
attention to what is going on close to your very doors. Rank,
as you are aware, has its duties as well as its pleasures, and your
duties as Marchioness, which you carry out with such exemplary
skill and enthusiasm every evening1, have naturally prevented you
from having the pleasure of paying a visit to the Strand Theatre,
whioh, perhaps, you are not aware is in your immediate neighbour-
hood. Indeed, your Ladyship has only to bound across the road,
and you will find a pleasant room
and an admirable company.
"Whether you will prefer the room
to the company, 1 am unable to
say, but both are so good, that I
think you will be gratified in my
having called your attention to the
very excellent entertainment which
is going on within a stone's throw—
so to speak—for people do not throw
stones m these modern well-behaved
davs—of your own mansion.
The entertainment consists chiefly
of an American Drama called My
Sweetheart, and the principal enter-
tainer is a young lady—Miss Minnie
Palmeb,—whose performance you
will doubtless find after your own
heart. Indeed she is the life and
soul of the piece. A pretty, arch,
petite damsel, agile as a Kitten, play-
ful as a school-girl, yet full of an
indescribable grace and espieglerie
which is emphatically her own.
Bright, arch, and crisp as a cracknel
by Huntley and Palmeb, — for
aught I know she may be a junior
partner in the firm, and derive her
crispness from that famous factory,
—you would, I feel certain, look upon her talents with the
greatest admiration. Whether she is singing or dancing, or love-
making, or romping, you will find yourself quite oarried away by
the spirit and go of her acting.
But do not, my dear Miss Lotta, allow yourself to be carried away
before you have witnessed the clever rendering of Tony by Mr.
Charles Arnold. I am sure
Mr. Leslie, whose perform-
ance in Rip Van Winkle you
may remember, would be
charmed at the alternations
of pathos and light-hearted-
ness Mr. Arnold displays
while depicting a somewhat
difficult character. You will
also be pleased with Joe
Shotwell, the " broken-down
sport"—whatever that may
be, baccarat and skittles may
both now be considered
"broken-down sports"—in-
terpreted with much grim
humour by Mr. T. J. Haw-
kins. You will doubtless
enjoy a hearty laugh over
Mr. Philip Ben Greet's
Dudley Harcourt. His ecc ?n-
trio little back step appears
to be as hugely relished as
Dundreary's hop was years
ago. You will also not forget
Miss Eleanor Bufton, who
looks as well as ever she did
as Mrs. Fleeter, and plays as well as ever she did in the 'old
Strand days. In the words of your friend, Mr. Richard Sxciveller,
the Opera Comique "commands an uninterrupted view of over the
wav," and "its contingent advantages are extraordinary." Therefore
I should advise you to embrace the earliest opportunity of dropping
in_ " over the way," and enjoying the " contingent advantages of
Miss Minnie Palmer's performance. With kind regards to Mr.
Siciteller, believe me to be, Yours truly, Squlbbs.
The Minnie Palmer Boll.

LA PRESSE ANGLOPHOBE.
(Nice Extracts from Neighbourly Newspapers.)
L'Orifla?nme (Royalist and Religious) :—The revolutionary and
atheistical character of Sir Gladstone's Government is at last
unmasked. It protects Lord Bradlaugh, and wants to murder the
Mahdi. As the firmest supporter of Throne and Altar in degenerate
France, we espouse the cause of the rebel Moslem impostor.
Our latest advices from Algeria state that the insurrection of the
Pousseh-Abou tribe has been suppressed. The Chiefs have been shot,
and twenty per cent, of their followers stifled in convenient caverns.
I!Injuste Milieu (organ of Government and Respectability):—The
recent, the actual events in Egypt and the Soudan almost incline us
to believe in a Providence. We cannot but see herein the signal
punishment of England's duplicity towards us We must hail the
advent of Lord Salisbury to power with enthusiasm. He is just the
Statesman likely to sy mpathise with M. Jules Ferry on the question
of revising Constitutions and reforming Upper Houses; while Sir
Stafford Northcote's reverence for Republican institutions is Baid
to almost amount to fanaticism.
The last glorious victories in Tonquin are worthy of the French
flag—we can say no more. Nine villages burnt, two thousand
Mongolians killed, and a treaty concluded with a King nearly four-
teen years old, which secures us the right of holding as much land
as we like for so many slate-pencils and marbles per hectare.
L'Anarchie Rouge (advocating a policy of universal smithereens):
—Admirable Mahdi! Base and brutal Gladstone! They represent
quite fairly in our opinion the opposing, the irreconcilable forces of
labour and property, of revolution and stagnation; slave-trading
and the trackless desert on one side, on the other emancipation and
railways. If only the Irish would join the Prophet, our joy would
be complete. As for the people who say that the Mahdi and the Irish
are religious, they haven t a French Radical's enlightened faith in an
Agnostic Prophet, and a Parnell wedded to Communism in land.
The last accounts from Madagascar seem to imply that we are
about to annex the whole island. Tout mieux. Radical Republi-
canism can't be spread too far for us by foul means. But that
invading, butchering Britain—fi done!
We subjoin some specimens of Continental Criticism from Our
Own Correspondent:—
Belgrade, Feb. mh.
You have no idea of the indignation and contempt which has been
aroused here by the action of the English Government in appointing
Mr. Jones to the Assistant Commissionership of Customs at
Alexandria. Thus the semi-official Scraggsblatt writes:—
"The insolence and rapacity of these islanders is intolerable. Not
content with entering Egypt as robbers, the English are now assuming
a virtual Protectorate. Let them disguise the meaning of Mr. Jones's
appointment as they may, they deceive nobody. It is a bold and
unscrupulous blow struck at the rights of Egypt and of Europe."
The independent Popolo observes:—
"Gross timidity and cowardice are the faults we ascribe to the
English Government. The appointment of Mr. Jones is an attempt
to sneak out of Egypt, and so to evade the obligations which they
owe to Europe. Mr. Gladstone's Government ought at once to
assume the Proteotorate of Egypt. But it is always the same. Did
not the Gladstone Cabinet direct the abandonment by the English
troops of North Borneo, when the bold natives had defeated them at
Isandula, and thus left the Transvaal to the valiant Afghans?"
The chorus of condemnation is completed by the Larron, a paper
written in French, and whioh also bears the title of the Troxsiime
Siecle, which says :—
"The English have taken Egypt, and are holding it by their
money-bags. When the guineas are exhausted, it will be time for
Franoe to step in. It is surely impossible for any Ministry to sur-
vive such a defeat as Mr. Gladstone has experienced in the House
of Lords, which is notoriously predisposed in his favour. Let us tell
him that Franoe is not smarting under any sense of jealousy, in her
comments on Egyptian affairs. No; it is the interests of imperilled
civilisation that she regards. The struggle to oust Mr. Jones from
his office is, although probably he is not aware of it, the conflict of
civilisation against barbarism. Gross selfishness is at the bottom of
the hypocritical and vacillating Beaconsfieldian policy of Mr. Glad-
stone. At the same time this does not prevent our also holding the
view that Mr. Gladstone is an honest sentimentalist, that he has been
consistently foolish all through, and that the chief faults of his policy
are recklessness, cowardice, indecision, stubbornness, calculating
subtlety, and total lack of foresight. Why does he not go to Mid-
lothian, and see what his Irish constituents think of him there?"

A BAD CASE.
"Good Heavens, Child ! what is the matter with tour Husband!"
"Oh Papa! He always goes on like that when I ask him to take me to a Theatre I
SATS THERE IS APOPLEXVIN HIS FAMILT !—AND SO OF COURSE I HAVE TO GIVX IS!"
And the worst op it is, he
[Bursts into tears.
Not its erect rigidity. Good lack!
/knew the virtue of the supple back,
Elastic foot, and shifty guard, as well
As Anoelo, or Mace; but there's no spell
In sheer invertebrateness!
True, the time
Fits for remembrance; and if speech, and rhyme,
And primrose wreaths were Policy, no doubt
You'd grasp success. But the mere platform shout
Shakes not the Treasury Jericho; hymns of praise
And Primrose Leagues, no more than busts and bays,
Perpetuate my spell. Their wizard weaves
His word-webs still. You scarce can reach his greaves
With your dwarf smitings! Oh, to stand again
And match him, blow for blow, brain against brain,
As in a hundred fights; with one straight thrust
To thread his maze of foinings, which, like dust
Wheel-raised in the arena, blind and foil
The fumbling swordsmen who now strain and toil
To break his iron guard!
Mettle? A blade
Of lath or lead by Pantaloon arrayed
Against Excalibur at fiercest flash,
Might type good Stafford's style; nor skill nor dash
In onset or defence. In such a cause!
With such a case! He might have wrung applause
From half his foes; he made his best friends groan!
Botched passes and missed points! To stand alone
Against a hundred such were no great task
For the triumphant Sophist. To unmask
His rhetoric-shrouded weakness needed strength
Such as his own; the subtly-woven length
Of his audacious argument bore down
Your duller souls. Achilles 'gainst a clown
Were scarcely harder put to it.
How he stood
The last survivor of our elder brood
Of mettled fighters, aged, yet untamed
As the old Lion, he has gagged and shamed
With his long-halting Policy, but whioh yet
May slip his toils and snap his subtle net.
And then t
I seem to see him in his room,
The battle-light quenched in the haggard gloom
Of troubled thought. That band of leaguered men
Long waiting England's looked-for help, and then
Deserted, dashing out to death, will haunt
His fine-strung: spirit, though it may not daunt
His foe-affronting courage.
Firmt Goto!
My sour, thrasonic Cecil, 'twill not do.
There is no firmness left; the flaccid age
Is all a flux—in words as deeds. Your rage
Which rises like the wave, falls broken back
Like the rock-baffled foam. You have the knack
Of sorrel speech, but had your tartness force
Like Hannibal 8 "vinegar," to give dear course
To Valour's steadfast steps, you were more like
The mighty Carthaginian. How to strike
A Joab blow you know, but Gideon's skill
The flashing judgment and unfaltering will
You cannot compass. Nebulous Northcote firm?
Yes. as the cloud Ixion clutched. What worm
So slow to turn? Lord of—the gentle jape!
And he the loose-tongued lad (my would-be ape,
The quidnuncs cry) potent at platform pelt
And boyish mire-bespatterings, nothing felt;
But master, when strong men large issues raise,
Neither of principle, policy nor phrase!
These be your gods, 0 Israel!
Better let
The curtain drop again! Not yet, not yet
The hour when my mere memory may inspire
Fire without force, and Virtue void of fire!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [February 23, 1884.
VERY TRYING.
A Record of a few Trials of Patience.
NO. Til.-—UNAVAILABLE DEFENCES.
HE Defendant,
Anne Ibbint, was
charged with be
ing drunk and
incapable in St,
Martin's Lane.
The Constable
deposed that he
found the Defen-
dant on her back
in the gutter at
three o'clock in
the morning.
The Defendant
indignantly de-
nied the charge,
and called Jane
Hawkers to dis
prove it.
The Witness,
Jane Hawkers,
addressing the
learned Magis-
trate, said:—" I
can prove, Sir,
this Lady (the
Defendant) was
quite sober.—
Mrs. Ibbins and me were walking along together at three in the
morning when she said to me, 'Mrs. Hawkers, what a lark it would
be if I was to lie down on my back in the gutter!' I said, 'Mrs.
Ibbins, don't do it. Some spiteful Policeman might come by, and
say you had had a drop.' This Lady (Defendant) replied, '1 don't
think any Policeman would be so dishonest. I shall do it just for
the fun of the thing.' Well, Sir, no sooner had she done it, than (as
I predicted) up came this Constable, and took her in charge."
The Magistrate. Very well. I shall tine her five shillings for
obstructing the gutter.
John Smith, no occupation, was charged with stealing a box of
cigars from the counter of E Gip Turke, tobacconist, of Sunderland
Street, Strand.
Mr. Turke deposed: On Wednesday I was standing in my shop,
and the Prisoner walked;in, and said, "Have you seen my new
conjuring trick?" I said, "No, and I don't want to." The Prisoner,
in an impertinent manner, said, "Oh 1 that's a jrity. However, I '11
show you the trick, and won't charge you anything for it." He then
deliberately took one of my boxes of cigars off the counter, and ran
out of the shop with it. I ran after him, and, overtaking a Police
Constable, I told him hurriedly what^was the matter, and he joined
the chase. We overtook the Prisoner at the corner of Bedford Street,
and found the cigar-box under his coat.
The Magistrate {to Prisoner). Do you wish to oross-examine this
Witness '<

The Prisoner. Yes, your Worship,
swear I come into your shop f
Witness. Most certainly.
{Tc Witness.) Will you
The Prisoner. It's no good, your Worship, asking him questions.
If he says that, he '11 say anything.
The Police Constable was then called, and corroborated the last
Witness, adding that he took the box of cigars from under the
Prisoner's coat.
The Magistrate {to Prisoner). Do you wish to cross-examine the
Constable r
The Prisoner. Tes, please, your Worship. (To the Constable.)
Will you swear you found the box of cigars under my coat?
2 he Constable. Most certainly I did.
'The Prisoner. It ain't any use, your Worship, asking this Con-
stable anything. He can't speak the truth if he tries. I never heard
such a got-up case.
The Magistrate. Well, it seems to me that there was never proven
a clearer case.
The Prisoner. Wait till you 've heard my jdefence.
The Magistrate. Oh, of course. Now is your time to make it.
Don't speak too fast, as the Clerk has to take it down.
'The Prisoner. I'mas innocent as a new-born babe. I was taking
a walk up Fleet Street, like our old friend Johnson
The Magistrate. You mustn't introduce matter which is irrelevant
to the case.
The Prisoner. I know, your Worship, sufficient of the law to
know when a prisoner's liberty is at stake, I can make my defence
as well as others, although I'm a poor man, and cannot afford a
mouthpiece.
The Magistrate. My' good man, I don't want to cut short your
defence, but to impress upon you the necessity of not wasting the
valuable time of the Court.
The Prisoner.' All right, your Worship. Well, in Fleet Street
meet an old friend named Barber—we call him "Toy Cavern"
(that's his nick-name), sometimes " Needle," because he gets so out
of temper.
The Magistrate. Well, surely that's not relevant?
The Prisoner. I suppose because I'm a poor man I mustn't be
allowed to make my defence?
The Magistrate. Oh! pray go on then.
The Prisoner. Well, we turn round, and 'walks towards Temple
Bar. We pulled up at the Grilfin, and Barber said to me, "What
do you think of this?" I said, "I think it a regular do." Barber
says, "Bight!" When we got to just by the Gaiety, I said to
Barber, "Hulloh! the Strand is up again! They 're always taking
the road up here." Barber says, "They '11 be taking you up here
next," and I laughed. I treated it as a joke, never dreaming such a
singular
The Magistrate. Would you kindly come to the point. All that
you have stated appears to me to be done with the intention of giving
yourself time to invent some trivial defence to this charge, which
seems to me to be completely substantiated. I think it would be
better to remand you for a week, to see if there is anything known
about you.
The Prisoner [suddenly). Please, your Worship, don't do that,
I'm just ooming to it. Barber says to me, " Look at that crowd
running along." I looked, and saw a crowd running like mad, this
Prosecutor being at the head of it. I thought they was running
after him. So I joined the running. I overtook tne Prosecutor,
and says, "What's the matter?" The Prosecutor says, "I've
dropped a box of cigars at the top of the Btreet." I says, "All
right! Don't you trouble, I can run faster than you," and I ran
ahead of him, and there I saw the cigar-box on the pavement, and I
1 ....... Here you
and says
_ new-born babe.
The Magistrate. As you plead innocence, I cannot, of course, deal
with the case. You are committed for trial.
The Prisoner here burst into tears, and exclaimed, " Oh. don't do
that, Sir. I don't want to make a fuss about it. I'd rather plead
Guilty, and have the thing adone with. Juries are so odd now, I
might get seven year. I plead Guilty.
The ^Magistrate. Then I'11 impose upon you the maximum penalty
I can give—six months.
The Prisoner thanked his Worship, and was removed.
AFTER THE SIMOOM.
Safe through! But as the ship with canvas rent
And shattered spars survives the lashing Btorm!
Camel and leader onward fare forespent.
To Orient fancy a malignant form
Looms vast and vague amidst the baffled blast
That scourges the wild sand wastes. This at least
Is baffled. Will it be the worst or last?
Who knows? But he who threads the arid East
Needs forecast clear and footing sure; for doom
Comes often on the wings of the Simoom.
Pleasantry of Peasantry.
"Great International Demonstration." "Meeting of Peasantry
at the Albert Hall!" "Arrest of Distinguished Noblemen!."
Millionnaires Mulcted I" "The Aristocracy Fined I" "Threat-
ening Attitude of the Peasantry!" Why did not the shouters of
Special Editions and the compilers of sensation bills of evening news-
papers use some of these titles P They would have sold the papers,
and they would in a degree have described the efforts of the gaily-
dressed Ladies and Gentlemen in aid of the funds of the " West-End
Hospital for Diseases of the Nervous System, Paralysis, and Epi-
lepsy," at the Albert Hall, on February 14th, 15th, and 16th.
The Red Veil.
Mb. Punch considers most veils to be an affectation, but the new
Bed Veil, which has recently been introduced, he holds to be an
abomination. It makes girls look blear-eyed and red-nosed. It gives
them the appearance of just recovering from the measles. Mr. Punch
trusts that He will not have to call the attention of his fair cousins,
and the fair ones who are not bis cousins, to this matter again;
but that from henceforth the Bed Veil wiU disappear altogether.

THE PARCEL AND THE PEER.
(Stray Chapter of Hereditary Romance.)
"Lord Tbnnyson has not as yet taken his Beat as a Peer of the Eealm. The noble
Lord's robes were prepared in due course, and were made up in a parcel for transmission
to the House of Lords, but hare not yet reached their destination. The police are
endeavouring to find them."—Contemporary Tragedy.
• • • • • • •
The ample cloak and slouched hat of the handsome Stranger lent him, as he
stood without in the fitful flicker of the local gaslight, almost a romantic look.
Yet the Official was obdurate. He would not let him in.
"It's no use talking about it," said the custodian, decisively. "You
haven't'got 'em on,—and that's all I know about it."
But I tell you," retorted the other almost fiercely, ".they were promised in
plenty of time, and ought to have arrived. It was arranged that—I was to
put them on here."
The Official looked at the speaker incredulously, and shook his head. Then
he turned from the gusty entrance, and proceeded leisurely n the direction of
the Peers' Robing-Koom.
At that moment the Policeman on duty in Palace Yard turned the corner by
the Victoria Tower. The Stranger saw his opportunity. With resolute alacrity
he passed the threshold. In another minute he had caught up with and was
facing his recent interlocutor in a small Gothic antechamber leading by a narrow
passage to the very precincts of the Upper House.
The two for a moment stood opposite each 'other silent and motionless. The
Official was the first to speak.
"Well, I never!" he said. "If I don't call you a preciou,- cool 'un! Why,
what will you be up to next?"
An angry flush swept over the pale features] of the Stranger. "Come!"
he cried, sharply, "we must have an end of this. 'Don't you know who I am P"
"Enow who you are P" was the ready rejoinder. "No,—nor don't care to.
But, if you don't walk off, they '11 soon find out for you at the Westminster
Police-Court!"
"Varlet!" shouted the Stranger, for a moment stung
from his altitude of high-bred self-restraint, "know that
I am "and he whispered a great name in the Official's
ear.
The latter started back a pace, and then looked at him
with a familiar wink. "Oh, indeed!" he said. "Any-
thing else ?—I suppose you have brought your harp along
with you!"
"Inave! See!" came the ready and triumphant answer.
As he spoke, the Stranger produced a large Corinthian
lyre from under the folds of his cloak, and assuming,
with natural grace, an easy olassic attitude, struck on
the instrument a few familiar chords.
The Official made a movement as if he would stop him.
"I will soon prove to you my right to be here," con-
tinued the Stranger, gathering courage, as he noticed the
growing alarm and amusement of the astonished subor-
dinate. "Listen!" he cried.
"You must mind and send 'em early, send 'em early,
If yams dear,
For to-morrow is my very first appearance as a Peer;
My very first appearance—so, if you mean delay,
I must nire 'em from Nathan or May, Hyams; I must
hire .'em from Nathan or May!"
The clear rich treble voice echoed down the cloistered
passage, and Beemed to drown the windy thunder of
oratory that was now rumbling loudly from the august
chamber beyond. The Official lookea scared. Still he
seemed unconvinced.
"You mustn't do that here," he cried, glancing
anxiously at the distant door. '' They '11 hear you inside.
"And they shall!" retorted the now inspired Stranger,
kindling with enthusiasm, as he struck another measure.
"What will they say to this?—
"All night outside the Upper House,
Beyond the doors thaf swung and creak'd,
The Poet, like some baffled mouse,
Behind the lobby curtains shriek'd,
Or down dark alleys crept about.
They would not let him pass the doors.
'That dress won't go upon all fours!'
They shouted. Then he peered without,
And merely said, 'Oh, this is dreary!'
'He cometh not,' he said;
'But when he does—however weary—
I mean to punch his head!'"
As the wild pathos of the last line rang along the
Gothic roof, there was momentary pause in the Great
Conservative Peer's Oration, that still came booming from
the adjacent Chamber. Then followed a terrible peal of
laughter. The Official knelt at the feet of the Stranger.
He was imploring him now.
'' Don't, my Lord! "—don't!" he cried, entreatingly.
"I don't doubt a bit now who you are. It's all right,
of course: but, please, don't give them any more of it.
They've heard you already, and it's as much as my
place is worth to allow this sort of thing in the Lobby.
Let me get you a four-wheeler, my Lord, and tell him
to drive to the tailor's. There must have been some
mistake." The poor man spoke earnestly. There was a
deep humility in bis tone. The Stranger was softened.
He suffered himself to be led back quietly to the
entrance. "Perhaps they sent them by Parcels' Post?"
he said, sadly.
"Perhaps," replied the Official, helping him eagerly
into the vehicle. "Where to, my Lord?" he asked,
obsequiously.
"Freshwater!" was the absent reply.
• • • • •
A little later, a cab was nearingthe Waterloo Terminus.
As it passed him, a Railway Porter, retiring for the
night, thought he heard a melancholy strain floating from
the open window. He halted on his way. Then the
following fragment of some sad complaining ditty fell
upon his listening ear:—
"Behold me gay as budding Spring!
And yet, I trust, they 're not too small;
—That when I get 'em on,—that all
May cry, 'By Jove, he looks the thing!'
"So ran my dream—yet what "am I?

GEE-HO! GEOGRAPHY! .
(A Fragment from a Romance of the Future.)
"And so those Medals used once to be given to the best scholars
in Geography?" said the young Enthusiast.
"Yes," replied the white-haired F.R.G.S., sadly. "'Twas many
years ago. They were competed for by the best pupils of our Public
Schools."
The lad (he had only just attained his legal majority) bade
the veteran hastily adieu, and rushed into the train. The passen-
gers tried to converse with him, but he was taciturn. They offered
him amusing books and interesting periodicals, but he sternly
refused both as he sat, note-book in hand, at the open window.
When the railway-carriage reached a station he called the guard,
and questioned him. This done, he would make an entry. When
he came to his journey's end—it was a long journey, and was
finished in the latest train—he made arrangements to start by the
earliest-leaving conveyance in the morning. Thus he travelled day
by day, week by week, and year by year. As he went his weary
and ever-changing way his brown hair became grey, and then
white, his straight form, stooping and then bent, but still he jour-
neyed on. He had no time to marry, no leisure for business.
I am glad," he murmured one day as he was travelling in
Japan, "that I have ample means of my own. Had I been a poor
man, I should have been unable to carry out my fixed resolve."
Some six months later he was in Siberia. Here he found a friend
who had been exiled from Russia for some offence committed against
the Czar.
_ "What brings you here?" asked the Political Prisoner, expres-
sing very natural surprise at finding his whilom associate in so
desolate a spot.
"I am travelling to repair a branch of my education that was
sadly neglected in my youth," he replied, as he hoisted on to his back
his immense pile of note-books. "I am sure, you will excuse me, as
life is short, and my labour long. I hope, ere I die, to know as much
as a Public schoolboy used to know in the good old days of yore."
And so the Traveller plodded on and on until he was a very old
man indeed, and felt ready to die. Then he took to his bed, and
asked for the Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society. That
Official speedily attended his summons.
"Sir," said the dying Traveller, "I have been in every part of the
world, and would now beg of you, as a personal favour, to give me
the medal that was the greatest aim of my youthful ambition."
"Impossible!" replied the Secretary, "those medals were never
presented until after an examination."
"Then examine me," eagerly cried the rapidly "expiring veteran.
The Secretary was not only an Official, but a man. He saw that
compliance with the old man's request would soothe him at the end.
So he asked, him to say in what county Margate was situated.
"Nay, this is scarcely fair," murmured the dying Traveller ; "for
even in the palmy days of Geography at the Public Schools, a boy
was never expected to know anything about the land of his birth.
Thus." and these were his last words, "while I have every detail
about Thibet at my fingers' ends, Thanet is still a sealed book to me!"

DIARY OF TOBY, M.P
House of Commons, Monday Night, Feb. 11. — " That dinner
of Saturday was thrown away,*' the Lord Mayor murmured, with
reproachful glances at Sergeant-at-Arms, as Bradlaugh gracefully
bowed himself out just now. "Thought Gosset was in for a tussle.
Nothing like good dinner to keep a man up; so had him at Mansion
House. Feed regardless of expense. Real turtle; wines ad libitum,
a< Horace says. Cigars sine dubio, as Mahtial remarks. Company
enthusiastic. At half-past eleven Brigos got up; wanted us to form
Secret Society to be called ' Gosset Band.' Motto 'Seam and Gi/SSET
band.' Song of Shirt, don't you know. Briggs always dropping into
poetry. Said we'd think it over. Glad we did. Here s Gossrrr
comfortable in his chair, and Bradlaugh going out by himself.
Eheu, fugaces! as Ovid observes, Another good dinner gone wrong."
Too true; Bradlaugh affair as stale as Irish row. No Bar drawn
out; no defiance of Speaker; no waltzing with Sergeant-at-Arms;
no imposing array of elderly Messengers. Bradlaugh took up
seat in usual way under the Gallery. Didn't even interfere with
questions. Waited till they were over, and then, with Labbt
and Btjrt as sponsors, interesting Parliamentary infant marched
down on Table. Burt couldn't keep up with his long strides.
Labbt, who has meditative deliberate walk, left far behind.
Speaker rose .to make observation. Bradlaugh would hear him
by-and-by. At present engaged in hauling book out of breast-pocket.
Mumbled something over it; bestowed on cover resounding kiss,
produced two documents, signed one. left both on Table, and then, a
little flurried, but with winning smile, turned to hear what Speaker
might have to say. Speaker ordered him to retire.
Why, cert'nly," says B., and, bowing thrice, retired back-
wards, with one or two anxious glances over his Bhoulder to sec that
nothing was in his way.
"I am nothing if not graceful," he said, when it was all over.
"Would have done it better, only when I started horrible fear
struck me that Randolph might have laid himself flat on the floor
to trip me up. Just sort of thing he would do. So had to keep my
eyes open."
After this Irish Members took matters into their own hands, and
things grew dreary. O'Donnell back, meaning to show Ireland he
can go further than Parnell. Healt determined to beat O'Don-
mu. Between the two, with Sexton intervening like long-winded
Queen's Proctor, they got House in pretty muddle. By way of
thwarting B.'s design to get evidence of v"
disallowing his vote!
"No need for Irish Parliament to go to College Green," says
Dilke; "Bulls browse just as well at Westminster."
Business done.—Bradlaugh swears he '11. take his Seat. House
vears he shan't.
Tuesday Night.—Grand Old Man grander than ever, and less Old.
Speech to-night on Vote of Censure revived drooping spirits of his
party, and dumfounded Opposition, who already saw themselves in
Office, and were chiefly troubled as to disposition of Fourth Party.
"Worst of our fellows is," said Lord Richard Grosvenor, "that
they 're always ready to give in. If wind rises to half a gale, begin
packing up, and rush for boats. Tories have two chances to one
when in office. They stick to ship and Captain till last moment,
even if they know he's running them on rocks. At slightest varia-
tion from smooth weather, our fellows begin to murmur and mutiny.
Do more to help Opposition than a disastrous campaign or most
skilful tactics'of other side."
G. 0. M. been looking worn and irritable since Session opened.
Has made cloudv answers to plain questions, and has several times
pounced upon Randolph, and shaken him. Bad sign that. Shows
things not going well. But once on legs, with closely-packed Oppo-
sition before him, and Sir Stafford meekly folding hands and
drooping head in attitude of Sacrificial Lamb, Gladstone the Grand
Old Man again. Thought at first his voice wouldn't carry him
through. Began to fail after first half-dozen sentences. Stopped.
Fished in coat-tail pocket. Nothing there. Tried other. Same
result. Could it be possible? Had he sat upon it? Another happv
thought. Felt in breast-pocket. Ha! Ha! Produced potatum-pot rail
of think yellowish liquor. Unscrewed stopper. Strangers in Gallery
thought he was going to oil his hair. Not so. Put bottle to mouth;
took good swig. Vocal machinery oiled, and no more trouble with voice.
"Here's an opportunity lost!" Randolph whispers to Sir Henry
Wolff, who in excitement of moment, was sitting on extreme end of
bench. "If we'd only abstracted pomatum-pot, Salisbury would
have been in office next week. On such trifles doth destiny hang!"
Gladstone's greatest triumph was holding House through dinner-
hour. Never since I sat for Barks have I seen House crowded from
seven till nine. Last Tuesday, when peril of Egypt not less, House
dwindled at same hour to twenty Members. "Feel sorry for Sincat,"
said Lord Mayor at eight o'clock, whilst Bourse still speaking,
"but have myself a Sincat-ing at the stomach, which must be
relieved;" and he went out. To-night he sat all through, not even
once observing, "Yah! yah!"
Lords had their fling, but rather a dull affair, voting Government
out of office by a round majority of 100.
"Nice useful majority," said Mr. Chamberlain, when at midnight
news brought to Commons. "But the House of Lords is the Jackdaw
of Rheims in English Politics. No one's a penny the worse for their
cursing." Business done—Vote of Censure in both Houses.

Wednesday Afternoon.—"Writ moved this afternoon for West
Norfolk, and House learns with surprise and regret, that Big Ben
will show his face no more. Had forgotten him. Randolph filling
his old seat with new associations. But he was a good old man, and
how the Navy is to go to the dogs without him, don't know. Year
after year he noted its progress, warned the House, and no one
listened. He's given us up now.
Afternoon devoted to talking round Grand Committees. No one
really opposes these except Raixes, who hopes some day to he Chair-
man of Committees. Doesn't like to see the real business going
elsewhere. Nevertheless, Conservatives talked and talked, and
talked Motion out.
"Dear me, I hope this isn't obstruction," Sir Stafford says, look-
ing uneasily round.
No," said Stanhope, "it isn't obstruction, but all the same,
Government haven't been able to do anything this afternoon."
Business done.—None.
Thursday Night.—Few things more imposing than Forster, when
access of honesty comes upon him, and, at whatever cost of personal
feeling, he is compelled to denounce old colleagues. On these occa-
sions, a9 he stands in Liberal Camp, and is uproariously cheered by
the enemy, he looks ruggeder and more honest than ever. Hair more
rumpled, face flushed, and clothes more than ever suggestive of being
made for somebody else a size larger. Thing has been done fre-
quently. Political history full of Ministers out of place discovering
growing iniquity in late colleagues. \ But no one ever dressed or
looked part so well as Forster.
Got along splendidly up to certain point, and that, unfortunately,
crucial one. Having demonstrated stage by stage the fatal, hope-
less, unrelieved failure of Government, finished up by calmly
announcing that he would vote for them. Opposition, lately jubi-
lant, stricken dumb. Liberals rudely laughed. Gentlemen below
Gangway been interruptive before. Had uttered impatient snorts,
and dropped indignant ejaculations. Forster, descending from
dignity of Judge to attitude of irate Policeman, from time to time
dashed in among them, got hold of somebody, and began to scold
him. In angry excitement of moment always got wrong sow by the
ear. Much squealing followed; Right Hon. Gentlemen bickered:
Radicals jeered; Conservatives madly cheered; Speaker called
"Order! Order!" and Forster retired from personal fray with that
slow stride and comical assumption of dignity which policeman puts
on after ponderously dashing into crowd, taking up" somebody,
and being convinced it is the wrong man.
"Forster means well," Harcourt said when it was all over,
"but does not manage cleverlv. No one can blame him for making
speech against his own side. Done it myself often, but his conclu-
sion spoils all. He gives the butter of his speech to the Con-
servatives, and the bread of his vote to Liberals, leaving j both
dissatisfied and angry."
Business done.—More speeches on "Vote of Censure.
Friday Night.—" Must have Lyons on our side," said Major
Nolan—or is it Colonel j'now? In" these warlike times officers on
active service advance so rapidly. Remember before Ashantee War
he was Captain Nolan.
Dr. Lyons been discussing for nearly an hour policy in Egypt.
Most prodigious dose of commonplace House yet taken. Half a
hundredweight of bread pills as innoxious, but more nourishing.
".Yes," continued Nolan, "must bring^ him as peace-offering to
Parnell. "Expect he '11 want well shaking before taking ;' but I '11
do it," and the/Warrior puffed out his ohest, wagged his .head, and
felt his biceps.
"What'8 Nolan doing among the Parnellites ?J" I asked Lord
Mayor. "He sat with the Liberals last Session." ,
"He's gone over Nolans volens." said the great scholar. 'General
election coming on, you know." Made as if he would playfully plant
forefinger in my ribs; but remembered he was Lord Mayor, and
stopped in time.

A " Day" on the Treadmill,
Feb. 12, 1884.
A HAPPY DAY.
"Mr. Justice Day, with the Mayor of Leeds, yesterday inspected the gaol
at Armlcy. During his tour of the building hU Lordship mounted the wheel
of the treadmill, and worked it himself. After spending two hours in the
gaol bis Lordship certified in the Visiting Justices' book that the prison was
in a high state of discipline."—Daily News, Feb. 13th.
The highly satisfactory experience of Mr. Justice Day on the
treadmill at Annley Gaol last week, has, as might have been fore-
seen, led to the expression
of such a hearty and unani-
mous desire on the part of
his brethren of the Bench to
emulate him in his spirit of
practical inquiry, that the
whole of Her Majesty's
Judges presented themselves
in a body at an early hour
yesterday morning, at Mill-
bank, and clamoured eagerly
to be allowed to submit
themselves for the rest of
the day to the full and most
rigorous discipline of the
establishment. On the
Deputy-Governor being sent
for, and the nature of
their demand explained to
him, he most courteously in-
timated that he would do
his best to comply with it,
and proceeded forthwith to
summon the necessary Officials, who, supported by a strong company
of armed Warders, good-humouredly took charge of the learned
visitors, and promptly subjected them, without further ado, to the
ordeal of the preliminary bath.
Several Judges from the Court of Appeal having expressed them-
selves thoroughly satisfied with this refreshing commencement, and
requested that they might be allowed to sit down to a little oakum,
the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, Baron Huddlestone,
and Vice-Chancellor Bacon, acting on the somewhat pertinacious
advice of Mr. Justice Day, who watched their proceedings with
evident interest and amusement, ultimately mounted the treadmill,
the Deputy-Governor leaving them merrily at work as he conducted
the remainder of the party to another part of the building. Being
shown the various contrivances for personal restraint, the whole of
the Queen's Bench Division demanded that they might be thrown
into irons, a request that was immediately complied with. The rest
of the day was pleasantly passed in stone-breaking, cell-scouring, and
other penitential recreations, varied by an occasional turn at the
crank, the whole culminating in a genial demand on the part of the
Lord Chancellor, that one or more of the younger Judges should
receive a dozen lashes apiece from the cat. As it was, however, now
past five o'clock, this part of the programme had, much to the dis-
appointment of the Chancellor, who was manifesting a quiet but
keen interest in the preparations, to be reluctantly postponed for
another occasion.
As the Deputy-Governor was bidding farewell to his guests a good
deal of merriment was caused by the discovery that, owing to the
fact that the official in charge of the treadmill had somewhat mis-
understood his orders, the Lord Chief Justice and his three learned
colleagues were still hard at work on the wheel. This little con-
tretemps having been set right, and the four fatigued sufferers
gently helped down, Mr. Justice Bowen, who had joined the
party too late in the day to enable him to take an active part in the
proceedings, cordially thanked the Deputy-Governor in the name of
his learned brethren for the great pleasure they had derived from
their visit. Nine-and-twenty stretchers being then provided, the
learned visitors slowly dispersed to their respective homes.
Check!
We know that " the wind is tempered to the shorn lamb," and, as
far as we can see, things look likely to be made pleasant for the
Shorncliffe. For some time past the South Eastern have been enjoy-
ing a goodly portion of the Folkestone traffic at Shorncliffe, therefore
the London, Chatham and Dover are about to construct a short line
of seven miles, and have a Shorncliffe station of their own. Mr.
Forbes, by this dexterous movement, hus benefited both the Publio
and his Company, and yet Sir Edward Watkin is not happy!
Some of the Highland Regiments are dissatisfied at the contem-
plated abolition of the "Feather Bonnet." Of course, this was a
part of their uniform on which they had specially plumed themselves.

THE LAST PUNTER.
Society, frivolous and irresponsible, was frivolous and irre-
sponsible no longer. It had made up its mind to sternly put down
the excessive gambling which then raged in England, and deputed
Mr. How ABU Vincent and Sir James Ingham to see that it was put
down. Most thoroughly they did their work. Very soon did the
Park Club fall, and its weary disconsolate members were perforce
compelled to retire to bed at the early and unwholesome nour of
three, which, in many cases, entailed the consequences of arising at
noon, with a sad long day to look forward to. Gambling Club after
Gambling Club fell right and left, and many a luckless man without
five hundred pence was fined five hundred pounds. Then came
the memorable Black Thursday, when the raid was made on the
Society Clubs, and leaders of fashion, representatives of the Aris-
tocracy, Members of Parliament, and Mashers were ruthlessly sent to
prison, without the option of a fine, for having beguiled the monotony
of their lives by the exquisite tcarte and the practical "poker." The
language used by the Generals, when card-playing was forbidden at
the Military Clubs, will never be forgotten by those who heard it,
but the climax came when a Bishop, apron and all, was sentenced to
six months' hard labour, for having played whist at the Athenaeum,
Clubs were killed, and Howard Vincent rested on his laurels.
But not for long. It was the Monday after the First Spring Meet-
ing, and Tattersalls' was crowded with bookmakers and backers,
settling over the Two Thousand Guineas, when a cordon of Police
was drawn round the edifice,—similar tactics being simultaneously
adopted at the Victoria Club—and punters, plungers, leviathans,
little men, were one and all seized. Betting on horse-races was para-
lyzed, and there being no one at Epsom that year to bet, the Derby
was abandoned, and the thousands of thoroughbreds in these islands
were, by a stroke of financial genius on the part of the Grand Old
VOT.. LXXXVI. K
Man, sold as Cavalry horses to the Mahdi, who, however, never paid
for them. Once more did Howard Vincent rest on his laurels.
But his brain was too active for repose. He looked round for
another plague-spot, and at once put his finger .or rather his Police,
on to it. Not only were the members of the "House" marched out
handcuffed, two and two, but from every broker's office, from the
"Ship and Turtle," and from Bibch's, were collected Stockbrokers,
Jobbers, Clerks, Office-boys, and even Commissionnaires. The
seizure was perfect, and, as Howard Vincent retired to bed that
night, he was enabled to say that he had put down City gambling for
ever.
Other events followed quickly. In the absence of betting, the
members of the Gun Club shot for honour; but owing to their imper-
fect acquaintance with the commodity in question, had soon to aban-
don their pastime, and pigeons became as plentiful and as useless as
black-beetles. At the University Boat-Race an Undergraduate,
with the hot rashness of youth, laid half-a-crown on his own side,
and that being established by Sir James Ingham's ruling to be
"excessive betting," the Boat-Race was for ever peremptorily sus-
pended, and with it all rowing and sculling, amateur and professional.
It was a sister of an Eton boy who bet half-a-dozen pairs of eighteen-
button gloves against Harrow, that finished the national pastime.
For experts proved that half-a-dozen pairs of eighteen-button gloves
would certainly cost more than half-a-crown, and the M.C.C. was
stamped as an essentially gambling Club, and Lord's converted into
a screw-manufactory for Mr. Chamberlain.
Everything had gone now. There were no more games to be
played. A bold party from King, Duke, and St. James's Streets,
had, in the recklessness born of despair, hurled themselves into the
North Country, to learn the art of knurr-and-spell, but as they
never returned, or made any sign, it is believed that they perished
miserably in their heroic attempt. Punters grew very scarce; one
by one they dropped off under the harassing watch of Mr. Howard
Vincent. From millions they fell to thousands, from thousands to
hundreds, from hundreds to tens, and at last there were but four
punters left in England. And these four banded together, and leaving
London at dead of night, and by different and circuitous routes
arrived on Salisbury Plain, where, under the shadow of the great
stones, they sat down to play whist. But Howard Vincent knew
of it, and though three contrived to make their escape, one was
arrested and sentenced to two years' hard labour.
Three punters were seated round a boulder on the top of Ben
Wyvis, and as cards fell on that boulder were cautiously whispered
such phrases as "Three!" "Pass!" "Nap!" tiU a Scotch police-
man suddenly seized one of the group, who was sentenced to i>enal
servitude for life.
In a disused mine on the rockiest, loneliest part of the coast of
Cornwall, where never man comes or goes, where the huge Atlantic
swells wearily against the cliffs, two men, with a dark lantern, are
sitting opposite each other, and are "marking the king." Another
dark lantern is turned on the pair, and one is taken, and, after
solemn trial, is hung.
There is but one punter left, and he, weary of life and England,
takes sail for far-off climes, and is wrecked, and thrown up on a
lonely island in the Pacific, where he subsists on fruit and water, and
leads a pastoral life under the lovely foliage, and thinks it uncom-
monly dull, and would give all the beauties of Nature for one mad
half-hour again at Jenks's. He throws himself on a mossy bank,
and, taking a penny from his pocket, tosses with it, right hand
against left. Left is two ahead, when a copper-coloured savage, in a
white frock, with a ley of wild flowers round his neck, comes sud-
denly upon him, and presents him a paper. He takes the^paper, and
behold it is a summons at the instance of Mr. Howard Vincent, to
appear before Sir James Ingham, at Bow Street.
Gambling was at last killed, for, with a heartbroken sigh, the
Punter turned over on his side, and murmuring, "I am baccarat!"
closed his eyes for ever. And the kindly savages buried him 'neath
the sand, and made a rude, a very rude mark on the palm-tree at his
head; for not knowing his name, they could not give it, and not
knowing his age, they could but guess it, and they guessed it to be—

Mrs. Ramsbotham says, what with Mr. Chilblain and the Bir-

HUNTING PUZZLE. No. 3.
Having Dismounted, and Secured that Whip—to Remount I
BAR NONE.
Yestekdat afternoon, Sir William Hahcoubt was again besieged
by the Deputation from the Vestry of St. Paneras on the subject of
the removal of the gates and bars which obstructed the tramo and
locomotion in the immediate neighbourhood of the great railway
termini in the neighbourhood. On the principal members being a
second time introduced to him by Mr. Caine, M.P., the worthy
Baronet! expressed some astonishment at their reappearance, when
Mr. Westacott explained that a few vague bints thrown out at
their last interview by Sir William himself had so excited their
curiosity, that they found it impossible any longer officially to
restrain themselves. They referred to that portion of the worthy
Baronet's reply in which he stated that he had "himself been
seriously inconvenienced on several occasions in getting from the
London and North-Western Terminus, and had found the obstruc-
tion an exceedingly difficult one to deal with." They naturally
wanted further explanation of this highly suggestive statement. How
had Sir William got over the difficulty f or. had he failed to sur-
mount it? They thought the Public would like to be informed on
this point. His experience of obstruction and its removal was most
valuable, and a few words from such an authority would possibly be
of the greatest use to theframers of any Private Bill destined to deal
with the subject.
Other members of the Deputation having spoken, Sir William
Hahcoubt, in reply, said he could fully sympathise with the inquisi-
tive feeling that seemed to inspire his visitors, and he would be
certainly most happy to enlighten them as far as his recollection
would enable him to do so. As well as he could remember, he had
been delayed in the immediate vicinity of the North-Western
Terminus fifteen times. On nine occasions, however, he was proud
to say, he had caught his train. He had effected this as follows.
Twice he had, when rather late, got out of his cab and, leaving his
luggage behind him, taken the palings at a smart run, and so
reached Euston Square just in time to get a seat. On three occa-
sions, however, he had tried this, and, possibly owing to a late lunch,
failed to clear the ornamental spikes; but still, thanks to the
presence of a friendly and sympathising butcher's cart on the other
aide, he had by the help of a borrowed door-mat or two, and the
assistance of a local crossing-sweeper, got cautiously over the top
without any very great personal inconvenience, and eventually
started for the North, a little out of breath, without a ticket. Again,
he had accomplished three other successful passages by the simple
expedient of knocking at the door of one of the adjacent houses,
dashing up, followed oy the cabman carrying his luggage, to the
drawing-room floor before the servant could catch him, and running
along three balconies and making bis exit in the same fashion on the
further side of the gate. But he could not recommend this ruse to
the general public, as twice the cabman had been given into custody,
and, though he had escaped, all the houses on each side were now on
the look out for him, and he should think the experiment, though
justifiable, a little risky.
On the last occasion on which he caught his train, having twenty
minutes to spare, he sent the cabman to fetch the Duke of Bedford
himself, who, happening to be walking about in his own square close
by, came and very politely opened the gate with a large private key.
On that occasion he (Sir William) got nis cab through as well.
So much for his successes. On the six occasions on which he missed
his train, on one he cleared the gate mounted on the horse of his
Hansom, an old hunter, which he made the cabman take out of the
shafts; but the creature running away with him in the Euston Road,
and refusing to stop tiU it had got to Shepherd's Bush, he was full
five-and-forty minutes late, and had to give it up. The remaining
five times the delay was always caused by the same contretemps—he
fell into one of the neighbouring areas.
"That," the worthy Baronet added, "is the brief history of my
own experiences, Gentlemen, and I need scarcely repeat that if you
will get your Bill introduced, I, for one, as I said the other day, will
facilitate its full consideration."
The Deputation, after expressing their thanks, and intimating
that they should certainly act on the admirable advice the worthy

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
On, for the Muse that laughed and stung
On Gulliver's indignant tongue!
Curt was his speech and fierce and strong,
In lofty scorn of Cant and Wrong,—
And small indeed the times that teach
Weakness of grip for strength of speech,
Craving once more that Muse to fire
The chords of Satire's slackened lj're!
Oh, little day of little men,
What themes invite the mocker's pen!
What rush for wealth at any cost,
Honour and Health defied and lost;
What blatant parodies of Fame
(That hardly won and noble name),
Dragged in the sickly spectral lee
Of sallow Notoriety;
Ambition's highest aim to quaff
The rinsings of a paragraph,
And Life's whole purpose sunk'and spent
To furnish an advertisement!
Oh, for some Juvenalian verse
Thy sound and fury to rehearse,
While Indignation pours the strain
Which Nature may desire in vain.*
Where'er the stifled spirit fly,
What sights and sounds obscure the sky!
The Statesman's cut-and-dried abuse,
And frothy violence turned to use,
Dead Christian hatreds spurred to life,
To serve the ends of party strife;
The Lawyer's pa?ans in his fees;
The Actor's noisy juggleries,
As every little journal tells
Where last he shook the cap and bells;
THE "ZEIT-GEIST."
The Critic in his newest dress,
Suns scholarship or kindliness,
With no credentials under Heaven
For worthy work or asked or given,
And nagging, after Insult's wont,
At those who " do," for those who don't;
Patriots by bravos hired and sung,
For bright sword carrying fish-fag's tongue;
The Poetaster's mixture, made
Of pitch and darkness for a trade;
The Man of Science, self-crowned King
Of Learning and of everything,
Serenely squatting on his throne,
Fogged with conundrums of his own,
And probing with his two-foot rod
His muddy substitutes for God,—
While tambourines and banjos raise
The Hymn of Noise for that of Praise ;—
Our very island's sea-girt rock
Risked to be land-bound into " stock ";
Ay,—even Woman's tarnished crown
Hawked through the windows of the town,
And all our sires held first and best
In pufferies of all sizes dressed,—
Till England watch, through England's
Press,
The fall of English manliness!
Vexed soul, seek out som„ other shore;
Houses are castles here no more;
Vain in the penny-age to fly
From all the penny-trumpetry:
Or hide thee from the watchful zeal
Of those who serve the weekly meal
For jaded gluttons, keen to gloat
On savoury sauce of Anecdote.
• "Si Nature negat, facit indignatio versum."
Yet let nor cook nor eaters rue,—
The eaten seem to like it too,
For in Society's new game
Cooks, food, and eaters are the same,
And i ashion, spider-like, supplies
Her self-spun web to catch her flies 1
Thou boastful " Spirit of the Time,"
Wake prose itself to angry rhyme!
Soon shall the dark forbid the light
To any hand with power to write,
And the new myriad scribbling-race,
Like locusts shroud all Sense's face,
Rushing (where angels are not seen)
Into the Prigs' Own Magazine,
While Upper-Tens profusely scrawl
In grammar from the servants' hall,
Till Ink itself shall blush to tint
Nothing but amateurs in print,
And the true child of letters learn
He has no space to breathe or turn,
And scorn accept the Century's plan,
That all may write,—save those who can.
I turn me, wearied, at my desk,
From the last " thinker's " last burlesque,
The last Agnostic's windy plea
That none knows anything,—but he,—
In English carefully destroyed
To hide his meaning's outer void;
And. bowing to the wisdoms old,
Read simpler lessons writ in gold:
And would but in a single word
The " Spirit of the Ag/*' be heard,
Let him take up his glass and see
His image this—Vulgarity. Mastcs.
ROBERT DOWN AT THE OUSE.
We've begun werry well down at the Ouse this Season. Tv be
sure, there ain't bin no werry late sittins, and so no briled bones and
"Hideandseek " for the sleepy Members, but it's much cumfertabler
for us Waiters to git home at a resonabel our, and not havin to anser
a lot of aukward questshuns from our several curious wives, than to
be aneing about all night praying for them 2 trew Paytriots, Bigger
and Warton. Ah, them's the Members for my money, leastways,
they would be if I had any. Many and many a time did them reel
Waiter's trends blockade the hole Dizziness last Season, and sent us
all home appy and smilin. And sumtimes even quite hurly in the
evenin, when noboddy ain't a-thinkin of nuffin but their dinner,
like reel Gentlemen and men of breading, has that dear Mr. Bigger
—tho' he ain't so big as one would expect by his name—a-gone and
counted out the Ouse, and cum out a-smiling in that contented and
happy way, as if he know'd how we should all bless him, tho' the
langwidge as sum of the werry biggest swells used on these joyfool
ocashuns, was as egstrornery to me as it was plezzant to him.
When I sed as we had begun the Season werry well, what I ment
was as how we had had the blooming Sherryiffs, in their gorgeous
crimson robes of Offis, to present a petition from the Copperashun
about gitting oheaper water, which snows what reel true Paytriots
they is, and how carefoolly they looks arter the intrest of the werry
Poor, for, of coarse, as far as they theirselves is concerned, the price
of water, excep of coarse for washing pupposes, can't be oi the least
consekwence. We had a goodish sprinkling of Hem Peas, mixed
with just a few C. C.s to give 'em a relish like, at the Sherryffs sub-
sequent Bangkwet, as usual. Sum calklating genus said it was
about 5 per cent, of the hole lot, which was of course not bad for a
beginning. We gave 'em a werry good dinner, and a werry helegant
Maynew, one of which I collared as ushual for my little boy, who puts
'em in his Album, which he calls his "Guide des Gourmands,"
which I believe is french for " the frend of the Copperashun," but
I'm not a very good frenoh Schollar, excep what I learns from
Maynews. I don't think as Hem Peas quite understands the art of
dining grandly, like my City trends. They ain't I spose quite so
much used to it, and so they takes everythink as we offers 'em insted
of making a wise slection. But there really is one thing as I must
speak to our Hed Shef about, and that is his Turtel Soup. I acshally
had to hand to a heminent Common Councilman a plate of clear
Turtel as had got a peace of meat in it about the size of harf a Coker
Nut! When I handed it to him he looked down at it, and then he
looked up at me with his clear gray eyes, as much as to say, "Why,
what on airth have we got here, Robert P" and I felt so ashamed,
that I feels sure as I blusht up to my werry eye brows as I urried
away. As there may be the same amount of hignerance in others as in
the Hem Pea's Shef on this werry important snbjeck, I may as well at
wunoe inform the world, that Turtel should be cut into squares
slightly hoblonged, and should never, not on no account, ever exseed
wun hinch in eirkumfrence, the peace as I anded to the estonished
C. C. was more like arf a foot 1
How many of the most himportant matters in the Pollytickle
World depends upon dinner! If I had to write the histery of Parties,
in oourse I don't mean dinner Parties and such like, but Conserwer-
tive and Libral Parties, tho' I don't spose as there's much fear of my
havin to do that (although, of course, Mr. Long Man and Mr.
Black Wood, I am always hopen to a hoffer!), I should draw slitely
on my notes, and then largely on my memmery, in regard to the
warious himportant ewenta as I've seen either halltogether hupset,
or werry considerably haltered, by suckemstanees connected with
what ought to be the most importent ewent of the.day to a sensible
man, namebly, his dinner.
Take that Tiusday evening for hinstance when all the Pollytickle
World was a-wundring why Sir Charles Duke didn't rush into the
Ouse like a Mayniack and reply to the subblime and bootif ul speech of
Mr. Burke, the great Orator's grandson, I Bpose. Sum of the papers,
as thinks as they nose everythink, have give one reason and sum
another, but of course they was all rong, as ushal. The reel and
true and rashernal and only reason was, that, like a sensibel fellow
as he is, he didn't chews to be disterbed at his dinner. What more
And the consekwence was, as all the world knows, that Mr. Burke
wasn't smashed at all, but the Ouse was saved about a week's useless
talk, becoz the Shef gave Sir Charles a good dinner. And cheap at
the price, as the Wip smilingly remarked to me arterwards. And
that a one of the many reasons why I almost washup's the Ouse of
Lords. No matter what's on, weather it's Pigeon Shooting, or Irish
Landlord Shooting, or Foot and Mouth Disease, or Intoxicating
Lickers Aot, which is much the same thing, or any other ekally
himportent matter, drectly the Clock pints to 7"45 p.m., out they
marches in sollem file, and gos to their sev'ral dinners, leaving all
the busness to be finished by the hungry few as is obligated to stop.
That's wot I calls true Patriottism! They sets a grand egsampel to
the lower orders of mankind, never to let any other Dizziness interfere
with the principle bizziness of civilised life—Dinner.
On that ewentful Mundy, when the Rev. Mr. Brad law took his
oath as he'd go and swear nisself in, in spite of Mr. Speaker, and in

Bpite of the Sargent-at-Harms, and in tpite of all of us, we spent all
the mornin, and all the arternoon, in a-drillin ourselves reddy for
the hawful struggell with our tremenjus fo. Brown being a werry

a large amount of stimyoulent, that about a duzzen on us could
manage to drag him hout of the kitchin.

A DUKE ON COOKS.
"What I desire to see is Cookery taught in the most ragged schools in the
most wretched quarters. ... I desire that the poor should hare better
dinners, for the very simple reason that I want them to enjoy their dinners
more."—Speech of the Duke of Albany in Liverpool.
Better far than " sums or gram-
mar,"
Quoth the Prince, orweary book,
For the man who wields a hammer,
Is the learning of the cook.
Teach his careful wife to make him
8te ws in which his heart delights:
Then be sure that naught will
take him
To the public-house at nights.
Let him taste all kinds of
fishes,
Cooked in appetising ways,
We shall find 1 nut dainty dishes
End all matrimonial frays.
Little wonder that poor men go
Out upon the " spree" to roam,
When no chicken of Marengo
Greets them when they dine at
home.
Soothing is an egg and spinach,
Artisans would hail, no doubt,
Whitebait cooked like that at
Greenwich,
Turbot and the tender trout.
Let the workman tell his crony,
If to dinner he '11 remain,
Timbale of the macaroni
Comes with "Bouchfes d la
Heine."
There's much virtue in good
cooking,
As His Highness said that day,
Punch upon the subjeot looking,
Gives his verdiot in this way :—
Prince, you spoke a word in season,
'Gainst uncleanly plates and
slops,
Buttheworkman cries with reason.
Teach me first to catch my chops I
WHAT IT MAY COME TO.
The following leading (or misleading) questions will probably be
addressed to Ministers by reticent patriots in the course of the next
few days:—
Lord R. Churchill. To ask the Prime Minister at once to
state, for the benefit of the False Prophet, all the instructions given
to General Gordon before his departure from England.
Mr. Sexton. To ask the Secretary for Ireland whether the Master
of the Ballinamucky Infant Schools recently advised the children
under his charge to " aim high" in life, and whether the Govern-
ment intended to prosecute him under the Crimes Aot for such a
shameless incitement to violence and murder?
Mr. Ashmead-Bartlett. To inquire if the Government is aware
that Merv is called "the roof of the world," and whether it is not in
their opinion essential to the welfare of the Empire that anybody
meddling with the roof should have a good slating?
Several Hon. Members. To ask the Prime Minister to lav on
the table a shorthand reporter's verbatim account of the proceedings
at the last Cabinet Council.
Sir W. Lawson. To ask if it is a fact that General Gordon has
ordered all Khartoum public-houses to be thrown open an hour after
the usual closing time, and whether orders will not be issued for his
immediate recall?
Mr. A. Bartlett. To ask if the Ministry is aware that their
policy in Egypt has outraged the susceptibilities of Monaco?
Mr. Hkaly. To call attention to the nefarious and malignant
nature of the Orangeman who publicly expressed his opinion that
the best thing Mr. Parnell could do with his tribute was to dis-
tribute it.
We read in the Timet of February 19th that the Prince of Wales
visited some of the poorest and worst courts of St. Pancras and
Holborn. H.R.H. observed to Lord Carrington that "he had
never seen anything like it, not even with his experience of all the
Courts of Europe."

Gone, brilliant bard of limpid lays,
Which ponderous prosers twit as trifles!
Well, one may sport Pindaric bays.
Whilst one Parnassian flower-beds rifles.
In realms which know not prig or bore,
Who '11 say which held in most respect are,
Deep draughts of sombre wisdom, or
Bright drops—(like thine)—of merum nectar f
Small odds to those who freight the bark
Of the untiring Stygian ferryman,
Whether the owl outlive the lark.
Whether the Sage survive the Merryman.
But listeners by Thames or Cam
(Whatever taste beside the Styx is)
Enjoy thy tinkling epigram.
Thy lilt as light as trip of Pixies.
They may not, like the Laureate's, lull,
Nor fire us like Tyrtsean ditties;
At least thy lays are never dull,
Carolled in fields or chirped in'cities,
Piped by some new Theocritus,
Or warbled by some later Horace
They seem, though void of epic fuss
Which so impresses the Big Bore race.
"They 're not f great efforts,7 not at all,"
Quoth the quidnunc, severely. "Ergo
They 're nil." Well, Leo may talk tall,
But give us " Gemini and Virgo."
"Hie vir, hie est" brings greybeards cheer;
"Sad memories" to mirth incline us;
Those sly " Spenserians" about Beer,
Had won the praise of King&AMBRiNus.
How many votaries of " the Weed,"
Toilers o'er life's too leaden track, owe
Sweet midriff tickling to the reed
Which piped the praises of " Tobacco!"
How many thralls of sap and cram,
Slaves of night-taper s all too quick wick,
Have chortled over one Exam.
Immortal as its subjeot, Pickwick .'•
Well, well! omnivorous are the Shades;
But seldom hath that Stygian Soulier
Oared o'er a gayer ghost than " Blades,"
Whose transit leaves the dull world duller.
Nay, Pluto's self on that sad shore.
Eyeing the cards which on his salver lie,
Might gladly hail the one which bore
The mirth-evoking name of Calverlet!
* No one, not even an encyclopaedic philosopher, ought to require any
explanation of this allusion. But as none are so ignorant of really in-
teresting facts as your omniscient ones, we may mention (for their benefit
only) that the reference is to the ever memorable and eternally delightful
"Examination Paper" on The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club,
prepared by Mr. Calvxrlbt at Cambridge in 1867. The following extracts
will give some idea of this immortal composition:—
No. 4. What operation was performed on Tom Smart's chair P Who little
thinks that in which pocket, of what garment, in where, he has left what,
entreating him to return to whom, with how many what, and all how big P
Ne. 12. "Any think for air and exercise ; as the wery old donkey observed
ven they voke him up from his death-bed to carry ten gen'lmen to Greenvich
in a tax-cart." Illustrate this by stating any remark recorded in the Pick-
wick Papers to have been made by a (previously) dumb animal, with the
circumstances under which he made it.
No. 20. Write down the chorus to each verse of Mr. S. Welter's song, and
a sketch of the mottle-faced man's excursus on it. Is there any ground for
conjecturing that he {Sam) had more brothers than one P
Any muoh-to-be-pitiedGrandPanjandrumofUseless Knowledge who doesnot
know this deughtful/tu a"esprit by heart is recommended to lose no time in recti-
fying that fatal deficiency. It may befound at the end of Ply Lsares. The prizes
in this memorable competition were, we believe, taken by Mr. (now Professor)
S k eat and Mr. Walter Bebant. Those gentlemen no doubt rank this among
their highest honours, and their victory should be immortalised—as it is here:
"Better Late than Never."—The Ministry, by sending out
troops, have, in compliance with the wishes of the country, changed
their policy all of a Soudan.
Parallel to "Peace with Honour."—Capitulation with Credit.

thing for a Christian Lady to have two or

away to unknown people like left-off clothes?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business.
To Mr. Wilson Barrett, of the Princess's Theatre.
Mr dear Wilson Barrett,
Though Nibbs has had his ooat-seams repaired, and is,
consequently, in a less unseemly condition, he is still in a somewhat
so-so state. Therefore, it is
needless to say I take up the
thread of his discourse with
very great diffidence, and ven-
ture to address you. The bril-
liant success of Claudian, and
the crowded houses at the
Prinoess's, I am aware, ren-
der the chance of your get-
ting away for an evening's
recreation well nigh impos-
sible. But, some Saturday
afternoon, pop in at Toole's
Theatre, and see a little piece
entitled Pate Clawdian.
The world has been laugh-
ing at Mr. Toole, as a
comedian, for many years
past, and, now they have dis-
covered he is a tragedian, they
laugh more heartilv than ever.
If imitation be the sincerest
form of flattery, I do not doubt
that you will feel very much
nattered at Mr. Toole's imper-
sonation; and though you
might differ with him in his
reading of the part of Clawdian,
you will scarcely fail to recog-
nise the skill that has discovered
a rich, humorous vein in the
Roman's oharacter, and the indomitable antiquarian spirit in having
unearthed the jokes and comic songs of the period. Possibly, your
friend, Mr. E. W. Godwin, might object to the introduction of a
white satin Gibus in 362 a.d.; and though this picturesque head-
covering was probably not generally adopted till at least twenty
years later, I should bo inclined to look upon such objection, in
a truly great work like Paw Clawdian, .as Hypercritical, carping,
and frivolous.
I think Miss Eastlake would be highly diverted by Miss Marie
Linden's finished and earnest rendering of Almi-i-da (" She's all
my fancy painted her! "). The
accomplished Actress from the

Marcus Toolius the Rum 'un.

The Ilermit; or, Wurd next?
? x?06!?9 s would sn^e over tne impassioned and constant invocation to
Masher, and be intensely amused with the graceful gravity of
the classicalJig. You would also, my dear W. B., be delighted with
Mr. Js. D. Ward as Coal Holey Clement, and. in imagination, I see
your eyes sparkle, and see you noddle your classical head, while he
sings that admirable song, with the refrain " We don't do that sort
ot thing now—0, no I" An Actor of your high standing will, I am
sure, readily recognise the artistic fashion in which Miss Emily
Ihorne fills the Stage as AUerena, and the delightful brogue
>1 Mr. George Shelton as Thari-o-galus. A Stage Manager of
experience as yourself will, I am convinced, view with envy
the admirably contrived Earthquake—a combination of elaborate
machinery and skilful earthquakers, the like of which has never
been seen before on the London Stage.
It is the Actor's duty to hold up the mirror to Nature. I am inolinedio
think Mr. Toole
and his Company
have held up the
mirror to You
and Youbs. But
Mr. Toole's mir-
ror is concave
with quaint con-
ceit; it is convex
with merriment;
it is polished with
good humour, and
framed in the
bouleversement of
laughing Burles-
que. People who
go to Toole's say,
Now we must
go and see the
original." People
who visit the
Princess's say,
"Now we must go and see the burlesque." And if our kind friends
in front will only consent to go on in this fashion, nothing will be
wanted to complete the happiness of Toole and Barrett!
Trusting you will have a nigh old time in America, believe me to be

poor opponent by his ideas had "materially advanced the social,
political, and economic condition of the German people "! However,
I have sent it back, and caUed the Washington mob of office-seekers

Rather unpleasant for Von Eisendecker to have to present it!
However, I have made that aU right by addressing him personally

THE LUCK OF LEAP-YEAR.
(A Story of the 29th of February, 1968.)
The aged reveller, -white-headed and toothless, once more urged
his friends to partake of his profuse and extravagant hospitality.
"You really must!" he mumbled. "This is my birthday. I
was born in 1884—just eighty-four years ago; and since the hour of
my birth I have paid for nothing. My excellent tradesmen have
supplied me with everything—wine, food, furniture, clothes, horses,
and ready-money. And, I repeat, I have paid for nothing!"
The Veteran Voluptuary roared with laughter. The '74 Pommery
sec had mounted to his brain, and he was becoming tipsily communica-
tive. His guests stared at one another, and asked " Why was this?"
Why had this fourscore-and-four-year-old spendthrift escaped the
regretfully undertaken legal proceedings of outraged trading hu-
manity? The career of their host puzzled them.
In the meanwhile an angry crowd had assembled in the hall. This
crowd consisted of tailors, Hosiers, pastrycooks, usurers, livery-stable
keepers, and upholsterers. Every moment it increased in numbers.
"To the dining-room!" was the shout. And the turbulent mul-
titude rushed into the apartment occupied by the venerable entertainer
and his guests.
"At length we can proceed against you!" shouted the spokesman
of the mob of yelling Creditors, showing his victim the copy of a slip
of parchment. In another moment the old dinner-giver was almost
hidden under a pile of documents of a similar character.
"This is cruel and inconsiderate," gasped the newly-made Defend-
ant to a hundred law-suits. "You chose this day of all others—my
birthday—to commence proceedings. Why have you encouraged my
extravagance by affording me such long immunity?"
Then came the answer, which told the financially lost one that
there was no hone for lum—that At» future was the Bankruptcy
Division of the High Court of Justice.
"We have not proceeded against you until to-day because we
could not," answered the Creditor who had already spoken, iu the calm
accents of extreme vindictiveness. "You were born on the twenty-
ninth day of February, 1884, and to-day is the twenty-ninth day of
February, 1968. To-day, then, vou reach your twenty-first birth-
day, ana attain your majority. Yesterday you had all the privileges
of an infant, and we could only sue you for necessaries. But to-day
you are of age, and no longer can defy the tardy but effectual County-
Court Summons, no longer can regard with contempt the writ issued
with its special and terror-bringing endorsement!

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Feb. 18.—"Oh the dreary, dreary
twaddle! Oh the barren, barren talk!" 'Twas the voice of the
Speaker. I heard him complain, and don't wonder at it. All very
well for Members to come and go; enjoy excitement of Question
Hour; spend pleasant evening over leisurely dinner; come back at
eleven o'clock smelling of cigars. But think of the Speaker in the
Chair from half-past four till one in the morning, and this the fourth
night of Debate on Arote of Censure! Everybody thought Division
would take place to-night. So fixed on Friday; so settled through-
out Saturday. Urgent Whips out on both sides. On Sunday, " Lo!
a strange thing happened, as Mr. Black says in his novels.
Rowland Winn at church in the morning. Fancied it was Chaplin
in pulpit, denouncing Government for Cattle Plague at home and
Insurrection of Maiidi abroad; naturally fell asleep. Ex-Treasury
Messenger entered; been looking for bam all over town. Winn
hurried out. F'ound crowd Conservative Members in church porch.
"Must have another night's Debate," they cried. "Duty to our
Country—to our Constituents. Must make speech. Can't all get in
Monday night."
"But, good Heavens!" says Rowland, not quite awake, and
thrusting hat further on back of his head, Why didn't you say this
on Friday? Saw you all. Made inquiries; got list of speakers ; every-
thing settled. Urgent Whip out. You must make your speeches
another time, on Report of Address, on Sunday Closing Bill, on going
into Committee. Any time will do. Needn't lose them."
"Won't do!" cried chorus of persistent Members. "Mu6t speak
now. Postpone Division till Tuesday. Besides, news from Cairo this
morning. Trouble with Egyptian troops. Tokar may fall any hour.
Gordon may come to grief. Moreover, Irish Members wavering. All
sorts of things may happen in twenty-four hours."
"Ah!" says Winn, wide awake now. "True. Great pity to
lose your speeches. Must postpone Division. Excuse me,—go and
see about it. But walk in, Gentlemen; collection just about to
commence."
O'Shea, who knows everything, tells me this bit of secret history.
Interesting; but hard on us to make another night of it. Conserva-
tives heroically overmaster consuming passion for Debate. Affect a
cheerfulness though they have it not in present critical state of their
country. House almost empty throughout sitting. Stanley
Lkighton discourses on Lunacy. Speaks with authority, but only
five Members to hear him. Marriott, amid cheers and counter
cheers, declares intention of avowedly coming out as a Conservative.
"This is the last time he '11 make any noise in the House," says
Mr. Forsteb. "Not nearly such shrewd fellow as I took him for.
As long as he sat on Liberal side and supported Conservative
measures, he was somebody. Best game for ambitious mediocrity
to play. Once on the other side, he falls into ranks, and becomes
ordinary Conservative. Thrown away his only chance. Let it be a
warning to us all.
Business done.—Nine hours' talk.
Tuesday.—Joe Co wen out on the war-path. Unlike Joseph
Gillis, Joe not always up in arms. For most part seeks retirement
on some back Bench, and meditates on foolishness of mankind, who
wear chimney-pot hats, and worry themselves about plaees of power
and invitations to dinner-parties. Joe a phenomenon in political
life. Ability far above average; oratorical gifts with few rivals.
What a power he could be in State if he pleased! Liberals squirm
when, on rare occasions, he appears, and, protesting universal love
and desire not to hurt anybody, much less Mr. Gladstone, over-
whelms them with thunder rolled forth in rare Northumbrian
accent, and sticks them all over with poisonous highlypolished sen-
tences. Joe not precisely popular among Liberals. He can't abide
them. They can't abear him. He tramples on their accomplish-
ments and pretensions, and they explain that he is a disappointed
placeman. This highest tribute that can be paid him. Shows there 'e
nothing else to be said to his discredit. If he wanted place, might
have been Cabinet Minister to-day. But figure Joe on tiie Treasury
Bench, or bidden to State Concert at Buckingham Palace! Fancy
him at Lord Mayor's Dinner in uniform, or Minister in attend-
ance on the Queen at Balmoral! He's a man of crooked mind—
hopelessly, lamentably crooked. (That is to say, he doesn't agree
with my views.) But to talk of disappointed placeman is sheer non-
sense. Let us gird at the politician as we please. Hit him back;
he hits us hard enough. But for the man, there lives no honester,
simpler, less self-seeking, or bigger-souled man than Joe Cowen.
Debate on Vote of Censure over at last. Hartington delivered
perhaps best speech he ever made in House; but everyone weary
to death. Hour late, and only thing yearned for, the Division. This
came in early morning, with rattling majority for Government, in
spite of combined forces of ParneUites and Tories. H.R.H. came in
at midnight, looking fresh as a rose.
"Very interesting, Toby," he said as I helped him on with his
new cloak, made on pattern of that worn by The Stranger. "Never
thought Habty could wake up so. Little hard on Stafford, driving
him on to two o'clock in the morning. He never seems to get fair
play. Mean to go to bed early to-night. Just going to have a bit
of supper first. Come P"
Business done.—Vote of Censure rejected by 311 against 262.
Wednesday.—Tremendous rush of Conservative Members to House
at noon to-day. Left at half-past two this morning. Went home,

got a few hours' sleep, bath, and breakfast, and down to House
again. Bradlaugh yesterday re-elected for Northampton with
increased majority. Believed he would be down at twelve to-day,
Bwearing again. Hence this rush. But Bradlaugh only having a

Power, in speech full of lofty scorn, discusses Mr. Parnell and his

This shaft goes home. T. P. O'Connor affects not to hear. Mr
Healy very angry, and not nearly so effective as usual in reply.
• Sir Rip Van Winkle Otway wide awake now. "How did it
happen, dear boy?" he says. "Well, I don't know. A little tired
of Debate; thought I would take a stroll on the Embankment.
Then it occurred to me Division on Vote of Censure might take place
any moment. Wouldn't miss it for the Speaker's wig. Harting-
ton up, good for half an hour at least; Northcote to follow, another

at door. 'Putting out gas, Sir Arthur,' says one of the
Messengers. 'House up ten minutes ago.' 'And the Division?'
I screamed. 'Division over,' says the man. That's how it
happened. But I believe Warton's snuff was drugged."
Business done.—Got back to Debate on Address.
Thursday Night.—Lord Tennyson still hesitates to take his seat.
"Can't understand it," says Lord Brabourne. "/took mine at
earliest moment. Think it's a duty one owes to Queen and coun-
try. Tennyson, I'm afraid, a little eccentric Not sure that
Gladstone right in making these poets Peers, though, of course,
there is increasing scarcity among Commoners of solid attainments,
statesmanlike views, modest demeanour, and ability to write fairy
tales that don't sell. He ought to leave us alone, not swamp us with
successful Generals and over-rated Poets."
It is odd Tennyson doesn't turn up. Can't be difficulty about
clothes. Has been overwhelmed with offers of suits. Fact is,
he's superstitious. Always had doubts about propriety of his
accepting Peerage. Sees in abstraction of his robes confirming fore-
finger of Fate.
Meanwhile, House of Lords jogs along quietly without him. Peers
come down regularly at quarter past four, and go home with un-
paralleled precision a few minutes after five. Salisbury and Gran-
ville as freezingly polite to each other as ever. To-night question
of arrival of text of Gordon's proclamation.
"When will it be here?" Salisbury asked. "The newspapers
use the telegraph. Is Sir Evelyn Baring waiting for a Nile boat?"
he adds, with every appearance of genuine interest.
"I should think certainly not, ' Granville replied, with equal
seriousness, as if matter were not out of reach of possibility, but was
not, on the whole, probable. Conversation across table between
Granville and Salisbury, only good thing House of Lords has left.
Commons, after spending hour and twenty minutes with Private
Bills, and an hour and ten minutes with Bradlaugh, devoted rest of
sitting to continuance of squabble between Orangemen and
Nationalists. Gladstone says Session is being wasted. JosEr-H

profitably be employed discussing Irish Magistracy.

rington said just now, looking

little impatiently, for Har-
rington had been up an hour
now. "That's not what we
complain of, Our grievance is
that they let you out."
Dreadful man Harbington.
Vulgar, noisy, and empty.

so low as this?

Seiuocs Announcement.
Mr. Gladstone's Collars are worn out.
No more after to-day. Last appear-
ance!
THE SECRET OF IT.
"There was much laughter," says a contemporary, referring to
the proceedings at the great commercial dinner the other evening,
"when M. de Lesseps mentioned that on his first visit to England
the publisher who brought out the report of his meetings charged, as
the first item in his bill, '£50 for attacking the book in order to
make it succeed.' 'Since then,' observed M. de Lesseps, 'I have
been attacked gratuitously, and have got on without paying.'"
Laughter, no doubt, and plenty of it. But that publisher was an
excellent man of business for all that. There is nothing so necessary
to the making of reputation as virulent and persistent abuse. You
want to give a man a &rm_locus standi, rave like a maniac to cut the
ground from under him.
"Genius un-abused—abused the most,"
is a sound line, and so M. de Lesseps has nothing to complain of.
But there are other things besides genius—other, and less worthy
things—that thrive and batten into large and .unexpected proportion
on rancorous attack. Do we know of nothing—or rather of no one—
at the present moment conspicuous in our social midst whose name
has become a tower of strength through subjection to this vitupera-
tive process? Perhaps Sir Stafford Northcote and his following
will reply?
RESCUE OR RETIRE.
[Sir Wilfrid Lawson summed up the Government Policy in the
Rescue and Retire."]
John Bull to Gladstone.
Humph! Wild wash Sir Wilfrid Lawson
With pump-like persistence jaws on,
Yet he gives you here (I guess) cue,
With a difference, William! Rescue
Is your business! While the fire
Rages firemen don't retire.
When the wreck is plainly sinking
Lifeboat hands who are found shrinking,
Or with fear of danger smitten,
Get, not medals, but the mitten.
Verbum sap..' You've had a squeak for it.
Keep your place; but if too weak for it
Out you go! Don't rouse my ire.
You must rescue—or retire!
A COLOURABLE COMPLAINT.
A Pedestrian calls attention to the fact that the walks in Hyde
Park, "once remarkable for their dryness," are now covered with
"a kind of yellow sand, which the least shower of rain converts into
a muddy paste ;" and, he adds, that as a consequence of this experi-
mental essay in chromatic gardening, "the principal walk along the
Row is often more like a dirty road than a properly kept promenade."
If this is really the case, Mr. Bertie Mitford should wait for a
thoroughly drenching day, and> armed cap-d-pie in mackintosh,
hurry off at once to the locality in question. If then, on inspecting
the slush, he has reason to believe, after looking at his boots, that
he has really put his foot into it, he should remedy the mischief
forthwith. The energy that has placed the Iron Duke on a neat
private cab-stand in Picoadilly, and may any day submerge the Park
Powder Magazine in the adjacent Serpentine, is not likely to be found
sticking in the mud for want of a little enterprise. The public will
await the result of Mr. Mitford's stroll.
CRIMPING AND CRUELTY.
What is Vivisection? Cutting an animal up alive, isn't it?
Crimped salmon and crimped cod are salmon and cod which have
been " crimped ; " that is, cut up alive. Is not therefore the process
of crimping salmon and cod Vivisection?
What is the purpose for which salmon and cod are crimped? Isn't
it merely to improve their flavour that Vivisection is practised upon
them under the name of " crimping"?
Is Vivisection, performed for the purpose of improving flavour,
less cruel and more excusable than Vivisection performed for the
improvement of Physiology, Medicine, and Surgery? Is it any more
legal? Are not all fish-eaters who partake of crimped salmon or cod
partakers of the cruelty of the persons who crimp them?
If the crimping of cod and salmon is not already, as Vivisection,
illegal, are not thoroughgoing Anti-Viviseotionists in consistency
bound to demand that it shall be declared bo by Act of Parliament?

SOMETHING ON COMMISSION.
Further dissatisf aotion having been expressed in certain influ-
ential quarters as to the constitution of the Royal Commission
recently appointed to inquire into the question of the Dwellings of
the Poor, several of the leading Members again met secretly yester-
day for the purpose, not only of disposing personally of the various
objections raised against their individual appointment, but also of
vindicating the claims of their body generally to merit publio con-
fidence in the important undertaking they now have in hand.
The door having been locked by the unanimous consent of those
assembled, and Sir Charles Dilke immediately voted into the Chair,
he said he would not waste their time by any lengthy preamble, but
come to the point at onoe. On Friday last, smarting under the gibes
of a set of captious know-nothings in the Press—and elsewhere—
(" Htar, hear.'")—who had hinted that the presence at that Board
of several of the Commissioners, owing to their want of practical
experience of the evils they were called on to investigate, would be
worse than useless ["Shame."'), they had determined then and
there to adjourn their meeting for a week for the purpose of passing
the interval in "energetio personal inquiry." (Cheers.) This ordeal,
to judge from the worn and dilapidated aspect of the Commissioners
he saw around him that morning—{roars of laughter)—there had
been evidently no disposition to shirk. ("Hear, hear!") All he
could do then was to remark that he was not only prepared but eager
to hear what they had got to say. (Cheers.)
Lord Salisbury, who had his head bandaged, and was evidently
suffering from intermittent toothache and sciatica, and whose
appearance on rising caused a considerable amount of merriment,
Baid he really had very little to tell the meeting. (A laugh.) He
did not see what there was to laugh at. (Renewed laughter.) Some
twopenny-halfpenny scribbler had asserted that he, as a British
Marquis, could possibly know nothing of real life in a Metropolitan
slum. He had determined to give a practical contradiction to that
statement. (Cheers.) He had disguised himself as an Irish labourer,
and rented the fifth of a room in a back court in Seven Dials for a
wpek. (Loud cheers.) He did not see what there was to cheer at.
("OA, oh !"). His experience had been practical enough. He had hail
two stand-up fights, his head nearly broken with a brickbat, and he
had been taken three times into custody by blundering Constables—
who would not look at his card—and he had, as the result, got a
rheumatic attack, which Sir William Gull thought likely to be
chronic. (A Voice—" Never mind that.'") That was all very well;
but he had quite made up his mind about what the working classes
really wanted. (" Hear, hear.'") They wanted better homes, better
incomes, better food, better clothes, better manners, more polite
Policemen—and most of all—better claret. Some Chdteau Margaux
he had tried in Clare Market had nearly killed him. (Cheers.)
Cardinal Manning here rose. He said that he was unwilling to
oontradict the Noble Marquis who had given them all suoh an
amusing and spirited account of his experiences; but he, the
Cardinal, must beg to differ with him. What the poor wanted was
some really palatable drinking water. ("Hear, hear.'") His
colleagues might ^scarcely credit It, but he had spent six consecutive
days in climbing in and out of, and tasting continually—he might
say, copiously—the water of cisterns in the lowest olass of alleys in
and about Bermondsey, the Borough Road, Clerkenwell, the out-
lying districts of Kilburn, and the Isle of Dogs. (Cheers.) He had
not felt well since. (Renewed cheers.) Now if that indisposition
was the result of the water, the Government ought at once to supply
tc every pauper in this country a thirteen-and-sixpenny filter.
(" Hear ! ") A credit vote of five millions and a-half sterling would
soon remedy that evil.
Mr. Jesse Collings said, with all respect for the Cardinal'slfigures,
he thought it would be far better to contract with some enterprising
company to .lay on a good supply of " Apollinaris." Thi9 would be
far cheaper, and much more refreshing, and if it were found lowering
to the system in depressing districts, it could be mixed freely with a
little whiskey that could be chargeable to the rates. No philanthropic
householder could object to such an outlay as this. (Cheers.) Such a
beverage would, at least, elevate the tone of the masses. (" Hear ! ")
Mr. Lyulph Stanley, who had a very dejected appearance, said,
though no friend to stimulants, he was not unprepared to support
the suggestion of the last speaker. He had made it his business to
try and enjoy himself in an innocent way, after the fashion of the
lower classes, during the course of an East-End Sunday. He had
done all that could be done in the way of recreation in the neighbour-
hood. (" Hear, hear ! ") He had stood five hours outside a public-
house, and seven inside. Three hours he had looked at a gutter, and
the rest of the day he had passed in playing at pitch-and-toss with a
weighted halfpenny. (Sensation.) That is why he looked unhappy.
He thought the lower classes needed recreation, but whether in the
shape of Italian Opera, a State-aided Fancy Ball, permanent nightly
fireworks, or higher culture, in evening dress, with a magic lantern,
he was not prepared to say. ("Hear!") \
At this point of the proceedings a letter arrived for the Chairman,
and, after perusing it once or twice, he rose, and said he thought, as
it contained an admirable practical suggestion from a very distin-
guished member of the Commission indeed—(cheers)—he could not
do better than read it to those assembled. (" Hear, hear.'") It was
as follows:—
My dear Sir Charles,
I had heard of your projected Meeting for to-day, and as,
though I regret I am personally unable to attend it, I am most
anxious to give the excellent object that brings you together my
hearty co-operation and support, I have much pleasure in placing
the subjoined suggestion at your disposal. Would it not be an excel-
lent thing were some eight or nine of the Commissioners, who might
Belect themselves by lot, to hire an ill-ventilated room—say, ten feet
by seven—and undertake to sleep on the floor for a fortnight or so—
it being understood, of course, that the cubic feet of air available for
the whole party would be something short of the mark? I cannot
but think that some suoh experience on the part either of yourself or
your oolleag^ies would prove at once a valuable, interesting, and
amusing assistance to the progress of our joint labours. Offering
you this suggestion for what it is worth, I am, my dear Sir Charles,
Yours sinoerely,
A Brother Commissioner.
After the reading of 'the above letter, whioh was interrupted
throughout by loud and prolonged bursts of cheering, the Chairman,
intimating that his influenza, caught during his recent three days
apprenticeship to a match-box maker resident in a cellar at Hounds-
ditch, was again beginning to be troublesome, declared the .Meeting
adjourned, and the company quietly separated.

And if, why of course if I happen to hit on
Cokaigne, where plump porkers will run about whole,
Ready-cooked, what is that to John Btjll or Lord Ltttoni?

That is, stolen pig, and that pledge I won't violate.

But really, you know, if fat porkers will come
And solicit my fangs, as it were, in this fashion,
What am I to do? It looks tempting. Nyum, Nyum!
My mouth waters! Leo will get in a passion,
I've not the least doubt. He wants all the tit-bits,
He likes vastly well on his rounds to discover
Fat geese of Cokaigne ready cooked on their spits,
Whilst I,—well, of simple plain food I'm a lover.
But when a bonne-bouchc just drops into one's maw,
Unsought—as in this case—and prays to be gobbled,

Such a touching appeal? It looks awfully succulent,
Old Leo's engaged, I've a terrible twist,
I '11 fall to—and a fig for my foes fierce and truculent!
THE GREAT PANJANDRUM HIMSELF.
If there is one offence which Persons in Authority object to more
than another, it is that of Writing to the Papers—at least, when that
insidious device is adopted by persons under Authority. The Great
Panjandrums of Officialdom, of Monopoly, and of Trade would, if
they had their will, no doubt make it a capital offence, without bene-
fit of Clergy. As it is, they always resent it vehemently in public,
and generally avenge themselves on the detected culprit m private.
Certain persons, malignant minions, no doubt, in the employ of the
Civil Service Supply Association have lately been perpetrating this
unpardonable sin. At the Annual General Meeting held at the City
Terminus Hotel on Wednesday last, the Chairman, Mr. Geo. Peak-
son, referred to their guilty deeds in the usual tone of solemn scorn
(for the Press) and lofty indignation (against its anonymous and
interested correspondents). When Titan Commerce "gives itself
airs," the effect is very imposing. "The Shareholders," said the
Chairman, with large finality, are well aware that there is no
ground for any charge against the Association of want of considera-
tion in the treatment of its servants." One of the Shareholders,
however, protested that he was not " aware" of this, which, indeed,
was the very point at issue. This, though less imperial than the
style of Mr. Panjandrum—we mean Mr. Pearson—sounds at least
somewhat pertinent.
Mr. Hakdinge moved—"That a Committee of ten Shareholders,
not Members of the Committee of Management, be appointed to
inquire into the alleged grievances of the'employe"*, ana report to
the next General Meeting thereupon." This again does not seem
wildly unreasonable. But the Chairman thought it was "really too
bad to renew an agitation after it had ceased." He did not say why
oeased, whether from absence of solid foundation or impossibility of
obtaining redress. The Meeting agreed with the Chairman, and
Mr. HABurNGE's motion was lost.
And yet there was considerable show of reason about Mr.
Hardinge. He wanted the matter to be fairly inquired into, and
the Association to be fully cleared from an unpleasant stigma.
"Never," said he, "let it be said that the Shareholders of that
Association were soulless and devoid of sympathy for their assistants,
and cared for nothing but their dividends." Well, this has been
said of the Shareholders of such Associations, and said with con-
siderable emphasis. If it can be refuted, well and good. But it is
not that easiest of Big Wow-wow devices, a lofty Pumblechook-Yiike
repudiation of peccability, which will satisfy the Public that such
Associations are little paternally conducted Paradises for their
multitudinous employes.
Mr. Punch makes this little friendly suggestion to whom it may
concern, without—for the present—committing himself to an opinion
as to the particular points nere in dispute.
A Serious Business.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR NEXT EXPEDITION;
OK, STRICTLY ACCORDING TO PRECEDENT.
Extract from Government Despatch to British Unofficial Adviser
to His Highness the Sheriff of Tongs-an-Pokar.—In reply to your
announcement that the Sheriff has dispatched a f erce of two thousand
of the Retired Amazon Militia to seize the Death Swamps of Malaria,
which you say contain five hundred thousand miles of territory and
fifteen millions of the Cutthroatanees, it must be obvious to you
that your connection with Her Majesty s Government forbids you to
interfere in any way with His Highness, beyond urging upon him
the necessity of reflection. You will immediately send back the
Army of Occupation.
Cipher Telegram from the British Unofficial Adviser to His
Highness the Sheriff, ^rc, to the Government.—The Retired Amazon
Militia have been cut to pieces. The Cutthroatanees are advancing
upon the capital. May we use the Army of Occupation for relief of
garrisons and defence of country?
Extract from Government Despatch to British Unofficial Adviser,
§-c.—It will he obvious to you that your position will prevent you
from holding out any hopes to the Sneriff of relief from England
beyond cordial advice, which you will supply upon requisition. The
Army of Occupation may, however, remain on condition that its
services are purely honorary and nominal.
Cipher Telegram from the British Unofficial Adviser, Sfc, to the
Government.—Ruin staring us in the face. Leader in London paper
asking for war greatly approved.
Cipher Telegram from Government to British Unofficial Adviser,
§c.—Imprison Sheriff. Disband his Army. Seize his treasury.
Army of Occupation will carry this out. Further British force will
take possession of additional country as soon as possible.
Confidential Paper from Chief of Government to Secretary for
War.—How many troops are available for immediate service in
Malaria P
Reply.—H.R.H. Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief says twenty
Regiments of the Line. However, as the Battalions are rather under
their strength, this will only give us three hundred men.
Telegram from Cabinet Council to First Lord of Admiralty.—Send
immediately all the Marines to Malaria.
Reply.—All the Marines are being sent. Detachments are now
being moved to the desired spot from Asia, Africa, and America.
Telegram from Commander of British Troops, Malaria, to Chief
of Government.—Have now twenty Marines under my command.
What am I to do with them?
Confidential Paver from Chief of Government to Secretary for
War.—Enclose telegram from Malaria. Please answer. Despatch
will oblige. Avoid friction with Admiralty. Marines, as they have
been mounted, are distinctly military. Wire direct to Malaria.
Reply.—Commander of British Troops, Malaria, will do nothing
until Senior Officer is selected for service. Probably the choice will
fall upon Sir Chubchtll Howard Lennox, who, however, will not
be able to start for Malaria until after the next Committee Meeting
of the Senior United Service Club.
Telegram from Commander of British Troops, Malaria, to Chief
of Government.—-What is the object of our Expedition? Have now
some more Marines, 'a Cavalry Regiment without horses, and a
Battery of Artillery without guns. Think might make a dash with
this force, and relieve Potluck.
Reply.—Do nothing until further orders.
Telegram from Commander of British Forces, §c, to Chief
of Government.—Cutthroatanees advancing. Are we to retreat?
Article in London paper, suggesting intervention, has made Malarian
sovereigns (recently quoted at three-halfpence a-dozen) worth eight-
and-sixpence each.
Reply.—Retreat! Certainly not. Take Potluck, relieve Bang,
Whacker, and Tolderol.
Telegram from Commander of British Forces, $c, to Chief
of Government.—Too late. Potluck blown up by rebels, Bang and
Whacker surrounded, and Tolderol gone over to the enemy. Shall
we come home?
Reply (No. 1).—Yes—immediately.
Reply {Ko. 2).—No—certainly not.}
Telegram from Commander of British Forces, $c, to Chief
of Government.—Please repeat orders. What are we to do?
Reply.—Why, something. Advance. Carry everything by storm.
Lead lots of forlorn hopes. Surely you know your business. Have
you all you want?
Answer.—Nearly all. Kindly send two thousand horses, six
hundred elephants, twenty-nine camels, and seventeen hundred and
ninety-eight thousand mules. When these arrive can move the
Expeditionary Force of twelve hundred men nearly four miles.
Should also like a billion rounds of ball-cartridges, as I have no
ammunition. Kindly use despatch.
Teleg ram from Cabinet Council to Commander of British Troops,
9'c—^ our order attended to. Articles indented for will reach you in
the course of next year. May expect some of the mules in six
months' time, and most of the elephants will reach you a few weeks
later. Ammunition as soon as possible. In meanwhile have sent
you sixteen transports containing plum-puddings, sabretaches, wool-
len gloves, Highland bonnets, and sentry-boxes.
Reply.—Articles wired for urgently required. Shall I buy them
here r Will cost now about a couple of hundred thousand. Will be
dearer later. Please send a doctor if possible.
Answer.—No, mustn't think of buying anything on the spot. We
can't afford it. Doctor impossible until after the next Army Medical
Examination in August, when result of competition will be known,
Six will then be sent—if necessary.
Telegram from Commander, Malaria, to Government, London.—
Crisis acute. What shall I do?
Reply.—Anything you like. Money no object. Get out of it as
best you can. Please use despatch.
Telegram from Commander of British Troops, Sfc, to Cabinet
Council.—Glad to say that force under my command have won
twenty-seven pitched battles and conquered the entire country. ■ All
is tranquil. Meantime affair may prove expensive. Probably will
cost about eighteen millions. By the way, what shall I do with
Malaria?
Reply.—Thanks! Come home. Never mind Malaria.

TALK FOR LONDON.
Paterfamilias. Do you think that if I gave the local Policeman
half-a-orown a week (in addition to the pay which he gets from
Government), a good dinner on Sunday, and a glass of hot brandy-
and-water every night, he would be disposed to give an eye to that
particularly lonely common which I have to pass about one o'clock
every morning?
Materfamilias. As you are likely, dear, to be late home after the
theatre to-night, would you like to take the six-chambered revolver,
the patent electric rattle, or the bull-dog with you?
I nope you will like the new gardener we have got, love. I
engaged him because he says he knows how to drag ponds and
reservoirs, and I thought he might be useful in case you failed to
return home at your usual hour.
The Head of the Firm. So Mr. Smith has not been down to the
office this morning. Dear me! I wonder whether we ought to com-
municate with Scotland Yard, or the undertaker, first?
Sir William Harcourt. One of the Policemen in the Stoke
Newington Tragedy—in which a young man was first robbed, then
strangled, and his body thrown into a reservoir, the murderers
escaping Bcot-free with eight pounds and a gold chain—stated "he
didn't see any suspicious characters" about that night, although
a Gentleman and Lady did see a couple, at two different hours of the
evening. What plan can be devised for making the Police them-
selves rather more " suspicious characters" than they seem to be at
present?
Another Policeman said he " doubled" the rood once every hour,
i.e., walked up one side, and down the other—no doubt with the
characteristic and heavy "tramp, tramp," the meaning of which
must be obvious to the meanest homicidal capacity.
Howabd VrNCENT says London is the safest capital in Europe.
What delightful places of residence Paris and Vienna must be, then!
If a few more brutal murders go undetected, won't it be necessary,
instead of the Policemen "doubling" the streets, for the Govern-
ment to double the Policemen?
Earthquakes for the Million.
The Pall Mall Gazette says: "An Earthquake Observatory is
being started in Japan by Professor Milne of the Imperial Engineer-
ing College in Tokio." It is too far for us to go to Tokio, even to
observe earthquakes, therefore we are glad to be able to state that
Professor Toole has started an Observatory in King William Street,
where the luxury of an earthquake is brought within the reach of
all classes, and may be observed every evening until further notice.
A Fbiend was reading out to Mrs. Ramsbothah a paragraph from
the Tablet about the number of Cardinals now in existence, and when
she came to the statement " that to this number" (fifty-six) " must
be added one Cardinal reserved in Petto (Dec. 13, 1880),"—Mrs.
Ramsbotham exclaimed, "Dear me, how cruel! I hope they feed
him regularly. But what could he have done to be locked up all
that time?"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVART.
PITY THE POOR BALL!
Tin? following thrilling Letters, as a further contribution to the
newspaper correspondence on the subject of "the merits of Foot-
ball as a national game," will be read with some eagerness by
nervous mothers, surgical instrument makers, and all those who have
of late been watching the coarse of this entertaining controversy
with anxiety and interest:—
Sir,—I have read the letter of your Correspondent who signs him-
self " One who has hitherto Received many more Kicks than
Halfpence," and I can only say, that he appears to me thoroughly
to have deserved all that he has got for his pains. To go into this
tine manly game padded with " a feather-bolster strapped firmly to
the front of each leg, from the ankle to the hip" (sic), is enough to
rouse the ire of any old "back " alive; and, speaking for myself, I
should certainly, as the rest of the opposing team seem to have done,
have left the ball alone, and, if possible, have set your Correspondent
himself spinning in all directions across the ground. The sooner
such players are kicked fairly home, the better it will be for those
who, like your obedient servant, is happy to subscribe himself,
Fifteen Stone in his Boots.
Sir,—My reply to the stupid, bloodthirsty, and ribald rejoinder of
a "Raw Rugby Recruit" is the following extract, cut from the
Sporting Intelligence column of a provincial paper. It speaks for
itself: —
Gorham Athletic Club v. Limfino Rovers.—These Rugby
Union teams met yesterday in the Club grounds. The turf was
extremely heavy, but this did not interfere with the fast and furious
play that was naturally looked for by the respective backers of these
two celebrated "mauling" lots. There was a large attendance on
the grounds, and the Hospital Tent, with its cheery surgical trap-
pings added materially to the liveliness of the scene. The Club
having lost the toss, sent the ball cleverly rolling towards the ditch,
where a little scrimmage occurring, their opponents, who had a few
legs broken in the set-off, were forced to touch down five-and-twenty
times running in self-defence. After this, positions were slightly
reversed, and Brown, making a clever run with the ball to the
opposite end of the field, a rather hot "maul" followed, in which
both teams, amid the sound of tearing flesh, cracking ribs, and dis-
located joints, rolled over and over rather heavily towards the near
goal, under the impression they were taking the ball along with
them. Jones, creeping out of the struggling holocaust, now nearly
gained a try for the Rovers, but was quickly tackled by Robinson
and Jenklns, who, by some excellent free play, managed to fracture
his jaw and break one of his ankles, and so give the Club a good
chance. Although the match was then stubbornly contested by what
was left of the contending teams, "no side" was called, and the
Hospital Tent being fuU, and the Ball reduced to an unrecognisable
pulp, the game was declared drawn.
Upon this picture, so familiar to all who are in the habit of wit-
nessing what is termed " a game at Football," I make no comment.
But I ask, Sir, in the name of all that is English, whether such an
account as the above is pleasant reading for one who, like myself,
has sent all his boys in turn to a great Public School, with the injunc-
tion to each "to be manly," and has now, as a consequence, much
to his annoyance, to subscribe himself permanently,
The Father of Five on Crutches.
Sir,—I am one of those who, though wishing earnestly to see our
freat national pastimes kept up, would not only not suffer them to
egenerate into a degrading and brutal carnage, but even free them
from the reproach of that rough and rude horse-play, which, while
it inflicts serious mischief on the delicately organised physique of the
highly strung and timid, debases the moral nature of those who have
any share or part in its pursuit. Football, as I understand it, should
be played not with the foot at all, but by the hand. Satin tights
and dancing-pumps should take the place of savage stockings and
hangman's l>oots, while the ball itself should no longer be a horrid
and pachydermatous inflated monstrosity, but a light, airy, (jaily-
ooloured, and scented bladder, whioh the touch of a beautifully
gloved hand should propel above the heads of the tripping teams
beneath. No struggle, no rush, no maul" should desecrate the
elegant game, from which even a chance contact should eject the
clumsy and ill-mannered player. I have seen football, real football,
of this kind, played with grace and elan by the students of the
Lycees, in the South of France, and I can testify to the genuine
amusement, interest, and astonishment with which, only the other
day, I noted that a Rugby boy, who happened to be looking on at
one of these harmless contests, appeared to be regarding the game.
Trusting that, by the publication of this letter, you will help to
induce our great Football Clubs to reform their rules, and so purge
and improve a great national pastime,
— obedient Servant,
Sir,—There's a good deal, it seems to me, to be said, specially as
regards the Rugby game, on both sides of the question; but, mean-
time, isn't it possible to devise a set of rules that shall just hit the
right nail on the head, and give a fellow a free chance of a tine bit of
healthy and hearty outdoor exercise, without obliging him to run the
risk even of a badly-damaged rib? A little more skill, Sir, and a
little less of sheer brute-force? At least, that is about what seems
to be wanted to set matters quite square, and make them satisfy Common Sense.

The Moore and Burgess Minstrels are usually supposed to " never

the other day at the Lillie Bridge Grounds, when Mr. G. W. Moore
came off the victor in a walking-mateh with Mr. Alfred Stekl.
The latter gentleman was unable to steal a march on his opponent.
Mr. Moore used his muscles as skilfully and as persistently as he
plies his bones at St. James's Hall, and won by two laps and
eighty yards, amid enthusiastic shouts of " The Moore the merrier!"
and Vive le Moore!" A large number of Burgesses attended in

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The trait that seems to us to be the most prominent in Her Gracious
Majesty's Book is the Tea-tray. The Royal Party seems to haye
been a perpetual Royal Tea-party.
"The.QuEEN's Pages "—those in her recent Volume.
Hope Scott's Memoirs are most interesting; but, just as in Her
Gracious Majesty's Notes, where, what the public would most like
to learn is omitted, thus making the entire volume little more than
a developed Court Circular, so, here, just the very turning-point of
Hope Scott's career is passed over, not in silence, but with an irri-
tatingly mysterious reference. The biographer says (p. 86, Vol. I.),
"He sustained a great disappointment, which led to his giving up
all idea of adopting the clerical life. It is unnecessary to enter into
particulars." The interested public also "sustain a great disap-
pointment" by this provoking kind of reticence, which says too
much without telling us enough. We are thinking of trying a few
biographies of eminent individuals on this irritating, plan.

THE STAGE AND
SOCIETY.
The satisfactory position
that the Stage occupies with
regard to Society, in contrast
to its standing in that respect
years ago, has lately heen a
matter of frequent comment.
Therefore we view with sur-
prise the following Advertise-
mentinthe Daily Telegraph:—
STAGE —A LADY, of good
social position, REQUIRED,
to join eminent Actor in grand
West - End Matinee. Leading
Artists. Exceptional opportunity.
It would appear from this
that the Stage and Society are
hardly as much in accord as
we should have imagined.
The Advertisement is scarcely
dear, and we are unable to
tell what part the "Lady of
good position" is to fill. Is
she to appear on the Stage,
or is she simply to be a pa-
troness of the entertainment P
If the former, we tremble.
We may shortly expect to see
in the Era:—
TO the ARISTOCRACY.—
WANTED, a few Duchesses,
or Peeresses in their own Right,
to combine leading business with
general utility.
A learned French writer,
equally trustworthy as theolo-
gian and geologian, has re-
cently advanced as a proof of
the partiality of the Deluge,
that the Negro race are with-
out any tradition of their ever
having been washed.

THE COURT OF A. PEEL,
A Speaker elected by General Consent, in fact, without "Words.'
ASSAULT ON AN
ALDERMAN.
The days of Table-turning
are well nigh past, but when
Swords begin to show signs of
animation, things look dan-
gerous. The Sword of Justice,
which is suspended behind
the bench of the Recorder
and Aldermen, at the Central
Criminal Court, the other day
fell upon the head of Mr.
Alderman de Keyser. It is
to be hoped that this Sword
will conduct itself better for
the future, and will not feel
compelled to terrorise the Al-
dermen by weighty arguments
and cutting remarks. The
Mace in the House of Commons
must have heard things enough
to make it tremble during the
last few years, but it has pre-
served a dignified composure,
and has never rattled about
the heads of the Irish Mem-
bers, or attempted to give Mr.
Bradlaugh an admonitory
tap. Justice is blind, but that
is no reason that it should
damage the head of an inoffen-
sive Alderman with its Sword.
Let us hope the Lord Mayor
will see to this at once.
Something in a Name,

The Theatre in Leicester
Square that was to have been
called the Pandora, subse-
quently the Phoenix, and after-
wards the Queen's, is now to

success, if we bear in mind a
proverb at one time popular
in Paris—" L'Empire c'est la

THE OLD AND THE NEW STAGER;
OR, COACHING TEE COACHMAN.
Old Stager, loquitur:—
There, take the whip! I've tooled for the last time
The old St. Stephen's Coach. A many journeys
I've taken her when I was in my prime.
Those mounted knights who tilted in old tourneys
Had need of skill in handling horses; yes,
But he who'd drive this team without a blunder,
Will want as much, and maybe more, I guess.
Will you succeed, I wonder?
'Twould need less tact to drive a Roman chariot,
Or—say—conciliate Chamberlain and Marriott.
An awkward team! Plenty of pace and fire,
But, to command and keep them well together,
The steadiest nerve and strongest wrist will tire.
The Sun-god held his flaming steeds in tether,
But they were all well matched, I make no doubt,
While these,—well, take a look at them! They 're trying!
Near leader's rather hot, though swift and stout;
Off-wheeler's given to shying,
Whilst that young bay you '11 find a little randy,
With rather more of devil" than comes handy.
Bless you, I've had some raspers, in my day,
Close shaves, and narrow squeaks. They 're not improving.
Sometimes they 're half inclined to run away.
Sometimes you '11 have your work to keep them moving.
That Irish horse would spoil the smartest team,
And tax the smartest driver; jibs like winking,
Well, well, of my old seat I '11 often dream.
For you—well, mind, no shrinking!
Keep a tight rein, use that new break with pluck, lad:
Don t spare the whip when wanted—and, here's luck, lad!
THE FRINGE OF GENTILITY.
Mr. Pc/nch, who is very particular with regard to the costume of
his Parlour-maids, would not for a moment presume to interfere with
his Cook. As long as his dinner is well cooked and punctuality observed,
his Cook may wear a scarlet gown if she pleases, and her hair in ringlets.
Other people evidently do not take so liberal a view of such matters,
if we may judge from the following, which appeared in the Daily
Telegraph :—
ALADY requires good PLAIN COOK, for small family. Good
personal character necessary. Wages £18, all found but beer. No
fringe.—Apply this evening, five to nine.
It is possible to imagine followers being prohibited, but we fail to
understand, if the Cook derives sweet consolation from a fringe, why
she should not be permitted to indulge therein. Fancy, if this Lady
compels the Cook she engages to abolish her fringe, what revenge may
follow. There is no member of a household so capable of making every-
one of the family so miserable as the Cook, if she gives her mind to it.
Alexis Soyer used to say that the Cook of a Cabinet Minister was a
far more important official than his master, and no doubt a cook,
ruthlessly deprived of her pet adornment would speedily avenge the
frinjury in a series of the very worst dinners ever devised. It is
plain that the above-mentioned Advertiser considers a good plain
Cook cannot be too plain.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

EXTRACTED FllOM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P
House of Common*, Monday, February 25.—The SrEAKER going!
Gladstone moves Vote of Thanks for twelve years' hard labour:
seconded by Stafford Northcote. Phrases not quite so well
rounded as those of Grand Old Sentence-maker. But Staffobd's
kind heart evidently really touched at approaching separation.
Parnell rises, and whilst expressing profoundest esteem for
Speaker, accuses him of having abused Lis nigh office.
"Couldn't help it, Toby," he said, when I met him after. "If I
hadn't done it, some of the boys would. Joseph Gillis hinted that
he had ready an oration suitable for occasion. Healt would have
done it with pleasure. No: there was no trouble about Tin Pot. He
does as I bid him, howls to order, and coo's to command. Others
meant business. Thought I'd better do it myself: but can tell you
I didn't like it."
The SrEAKEE going! Lord Henry Lennox with his trousers (in-
adequately short to begin with) turned up, and a new coat on, fresh
from the Boys' Clothing Establishment, unexpectedly appears. "Imay
look young, he says, "but that's art, good-temper, and domestic
felicity. Itee'ly, I'm past forty. Have indeed been thirty-eight years
in the House. Feel bound to give the Speaker my blessing."
Mr. Newdegate couldn't hear this comparative juvenile posing
without concern. "Been here forty years," he says, in forlornest
tones. "Forty years of Melancholy look down upon you, Mr.
Speaker, and bless you."
"Had him there, said Newdegate, in an aside to Sir Walter
Barttelot. "Lennox always crowing. Didn't think I was here."
Speaker going! Hardly had murmur ceased when a wizened old
Gentleman, with grey hair unbrushed and one hand in pocket, sur-
veyed the House through pair of horn spectacles.
Fifty years I have Deen here," Mr. Gregory said.
"Now's your time. Colonel," said Dick Power, nudging the
O'Gorjtan Mahon dozing below the Gangway. "You've been here
eighty years, or is it hundred-and-twenty? Go it, old boy!
Don't let Ireland be beaten. Up and at 'em!"
"IV. dad, I think you're right," said the old Amphibious "Warrior,
who had been listening with hand to ear. "That whiskey they sell
here is, as you say, scarcely worth drinking. But I '11 try a drop
with a lemon in it," and he went out.
The Speaker going—going! One last Motion of Adjournment
at Question Time thoughtfully provided by Labby. Debate on
Grand Committees turned into Irish discussion. Then for the last
time Sir Henry Brand puts the question—" That the House do now
adjourn." Members throng round the Chair to shake hands. The
"ast passes by; the lights are put out; wig and gown cast aside, and
"e Speaker is Gone! Business done.—Resignation of Speaker.
Tuesday.—New Speaker elected. Whitbread proposed him in
speech full of that ponderous wisdom and imposing goody-goodyness
which have earned for him curiously high place in estimation of House.
"I am getting old now," said Randolph. "Not so old, of course,
as Lennox, nor nearly so old as Newdegate, nor half so old as
Gregory. Still, years pass by. Should like before I die to hear
Whitbread pronounce the word ' Mesopotamia.' How thrice blessed
it would seem uttered in his voice, with his manner!"
"He always strikes me," said young Balfocb, "as being the
Captain Bunsby of the House."
Rathbone little overweighted with responsibility of position. Got
up nice little speech; learned it off by heart; recited it without mis-
take driving down to the House; and now, when he rises and sees
crowded House, whole thing, as he subsequently explained in domestic
circle, "got upside down like." Peroration persistently pressed for
first place. The middle got out of perspective, and the opening
sentences nowhere to be found. Haven't often seen such spectacle of
piteous misery as Rathbone groping about his speech.
"Wish I could get him to sit to Frank Holl as model for picture.
1 Good Man Fighting with Adversity,'" says Agnew. "Splendid
subject!"
Speaker-Elect took House by surprise. Always thought him awk-
ward man who couldn't make speeoh without keeping a firm grip of
his holding on the table, and then stumbled along in awkward
fashion. His speech to-night dignified, bold, and touched with true
spirit of his high office. "Peel will do," was the emphatio verdict
of both sides of the House when he resumed his seat.
Sir Robert Peel surveyed the scene from the Gallery. "Wish
I'd been the good boy of the family!he murmured. "Might have
been Speaker myself. However, think I've managed pretty well.
Arthur goes with the Liberals, and gets Speakership in family. I go
with the Tories, and Randolph has promised to take me up."
Business done.—New Speaker elected.
Wednesday.—House of Lords met to-day to conclude ceremony of
election of Speaker.
"Can't stand much more of this," said Lord Redesdale, trying to
wipe his brow with end of white neckoloth. "Worked to death.
We '11 be having Saturday sittings shortly. It's all Gladstone."
"I like it," said Lord Wehyss. "The more meetings the more
opportunities for me to make speech or two. Don't know why Lord
Chancellor should have all tie talking to-day. Think I could say
a few words that the Commons at the Bar would like to hear. Always
a favourite with them."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"A chattering cockatoo," growled Redesdale, in his most guttural
tones, "full of Wemyss and fancies."
"He certainly ' fancies' Wemyss," said Lord Granville, sweetly,
trying to turn an awkward conversation aside with a little joke.
New Speaker now installed in Chair. Looks very well in wig and
gown, except that wig a little too large for him. "Yes, I know," he
glumly said, when I hinted at the little peculiarity: '' took it over from
Brand at a discount. Says wigs always are too big at first, but shrink
in time amid heat of debate. Says it was just the same with him.
"Wig never really fitted him till he stopped the Irish Debate a year or
two ago. Suppose it's all right, but it certainly feels a little floppy."
Anderson s Cruelty to Animals Bill on again for Second Reading.
Time, after five o'clock. A near run to get it through before quarter
to six. Anderson makes no speech. Harcourt supports Bill in three
sentences. Milbank hotly in favour of measure, rises to support it.
Begins to relate sporting reminiscences. Surprised at a quarter to
six to find he's talked Bill out. Goes out back way so as not to meet
Anderson. Business done.—New Speaker puts on wig and gown.
Thursday.—Another field night in House of Commons. Benches
crowded; galleries full. Lord Sherbrooke peering from amongst
other Peers over the clock, thinking of times when he sat below the
Gangway, and had something to say about Reform Bill. Discovers
Bright in familiar corner seat, and Gladstone in old place on
Treasury Bench, older in the face, balder as to the head, but erect
as ever; as full of energy and go as when Bobby Lowe did battle
with him across the Gangway. All unchanged but me," the retired
Gladiator murmured. "Wish I'd had Tennyson's good luck;
lost my robes, and never sank into obscurity of House of Lords."
Randolph in fine form. Nothing could exceed the power and
poetry of his imagery.
"Is this a time to bring in Reform Bills," he cried, frowning upon
Mr. Gladstone, "when Railway Stations are flying into the air all
around us, when our Cattle are dying by the hundred thousand, and
our Expenditure is going up Millions and Millions a-day?"
Curious to note how instinctively Members looked up as these
powerful and solemnly-spoken words fell on their ears.
"The Angel of" Death is abroad in the land," Mr. Bright
said, on the eve of a great war thirty years ago. "You can almost
hear the beating of his wings."
As men then sat holding their breath and listening, for peradven-
tnre they might hear the weird rustling, now all looked up as if they
expected, to see bricks and mortar, return tickets, fragments of
station-masters, torn time-tables, and loose change darkening the
air. Such is the force of oratory.
Gladstone knocked off his speech of an hour and three-quarters
with ease. Didn't even bring down with him the pomatum pot. A
glass of water sparingly sipped stood for all refreshment. Great joy
amongst Irish Members, who were afraid their numbers would be
reduced on redistribution of seats. Had all agreed to sacrifice
O'Donnell, but here unanimity ended. At Private Meeting of party,
ballot taken to decide who should go. Each Member named two.
O'Donnell's name on thirty-four papers; the rest among them
swept away the whole Party.
Scotch Members also sedately content. First effect of promised
addition to representation was seen at nine o'clock, when W. E. G.
gone away to dinner. Sir George Balfour appropriates Premier's
seat on Treasury Bench. Business done.—Reform Bill introduced.
Friday.—Always regret that Darwin didn't know our Joseph
Gillis. Feel sure he would have mentioned him in his great work.
Joseph has recently developed new oratorical gesture of great effect.
As he denounces what he calls'' the Goovern'ment" he puts long lean
hand on side of neck by ear, slowly rubbing and pecking himself.
At Monkey Temple at Benares remember a gigantic Monkey swing-
ing on branch oi Tamarind Tree, addressed ifew words to me with
precisely that gesture. Joseph quite himself to-night. Likens Mr.
Trevelyan and Tuke to Long Firm, and genially accuses them of
fraud! Business done.—Some Votes in Supply.

Wrapped Up in his Bill.
THE DARKNESS OF A FIRST NIGHT.
Honoured Sir,
Last month you were good enough to insert a few lines from
my pen, and I venture to hope that you will again extend the same
courtesy to me. That is a nicely-rounded sentenoe, which I trust
will square you. The other evening, having a little spare time (as the
saying is) on my hands, and a little spare cash in my pocket, I
resolved on visiting the Pit of a Theatre. I may remark, that I am
not a constant playgoer, and that, being a widower, I much prefer,
when I do patronise the Stage; to witness the lighter forms of enter-
tainment offered to us by the jollier form of Manager. I accordingly
wended my way to the Nimbus Theatre, and after some necessary
squeezing (during which exercise I was carried off my legs, and
someone else carried off my umbrella), I found myself in the front
row of seats. The Private Boxes and Stalls seemed unusually full,
and I could not help commenting on this fact to my right-hand
neighbour, a young gentleman who leant over the front rail and sur-
veyed the house with a most supercilious aspect.
Of course it is," he replied. "It's a fust night."
"A first night," I said. "What's that?"
"Oh! come I say," he sniggered, "that's laying it on thiok!" I
again protested my ignorance. "Well, look here," he said, pointing
to the playbill, "it's the fust night of the new Comic Opera, The
Green Goblin. You'11 see some fun presently. Won't he,'Arry?"
he continued, nudging a sandy youth, who was engaged in reading
an evening paper.
"Rather f" returned the other, " rather,—if this bloomin' perduc-
tion don't get the bird, my name's not 'Enery 'Opklns."
1 was about to inquire to what particular bird he referred, and
how it was connected with the piece, when the overture began, and I
concluded in my own mind that the biped was probably a character
in the play.
Halfway through the First Act a hitch occurred, caused by two of
the Actors forgetting their lines. With the greatest presence of
mind my two young friends immediately shouted " Prompter!" and
that official must have heard the call, as his voice was distinctly
heard proceeding from the side of the stage. My neighbours
rewarded his readiness with loud applause and cries of "Brayvo!"
and, indeed, when the Curtain fell on the Aot, they again yelled
"Prompter!" with such persistence as to lead me to the belief that
they were personal friends of his. During the entr'acte, 'Enery
confided to his friend (whose godfathers and godmothers were
presumably responsible for his appellation of 'Arry) that the
guying would soon begin."
Anything to do with Guy Fawkes f" I ventured to inquire.
"Rather!" said 'Enery, with a grin. "We finds the forks, and
the Icntfe too. 'Ow's that for 'igh?"
"Good!" said 'Arry. "Old Wagglethorpe" (the Author of
the Piece) "isn't in it with you."
I was still mystified. During the progress of the next Act I was
astounded to perceive that whereas many of the audienoe rolled
about with laughter, and cracked their sides at the very simplest
jest or the very mildest danoe, and accentuated their approval with
violent clappings of the hands, others, doubtless dissatisfied with these
sycophants, expressed their disapproval with violent sibillations.
Among the malcontents were my neighbours, who further supple-
mented their hissing with cries of " Yah!" At the end of Act II.
they again shouted for their friend the Prompter, who did not, how-
ever, appear.
As Act III. went on, the demonstrations on the part of the syco-
phants and their opponents increased, and after the finah had been
sung, their clamour rose to fever-heat. The Actors and Actresses
(including those who had forgotten their parts) were generously and,
indeed, enthusiastically received when they paraded before the
Curtain. Then 'Enery and 'Arry (evidently friends of the
Playwright as well as of the Prompter) raised, mighty yells of
"Hauthor! Hauthor!" and most vigorously brought the palms of
their hands together. I liberally seconded their efforts, for I confess
that I had thoroughly enjoyed the quips and conceits of the Opera.
Presently Mr. Wagglethorpe's graceful form appeared between the
footlights and the "rag" (as I heard 'Enery call the Curtain); but
scarcely had his nose emerged from behind the proscenium when a
moat discordant Babel of sound arose from the Pittites, and descended
from their superiors in the Gallery. It was a mixture of cheering,
howling, and the voice of the serpent. I looked at 'Enery and
'Arry to see how they would take this behaviour. Would you
believe it, Sir, they were emulating the goose with their mouths, and
clapping with their hands! What did their conduct mean?
"VVlien Mr. Wagglethorpe had retired, I overheard 'Arry
remark, "We baited 'im fairly that time, old boy." Then both
roared with delight. I have dreamt of these events all night, and I
have puzzled over them all day. My brain is incapable to solve the
conundrum. If you have a spark of charity in your nature, do
please explain the mystery and oblige
Yours distractedly, Dionysius Jones.

ANNALS OF A WINTER HEALTH RESORT.
Lady Visitor. "On, that's your Doctor, is it? What sort of a Doctor,
is he!"
Lady Resident, "Oh, well, I don't know Mucn about his Ability; but
he 'b got a very oood Bedside Manner!"
But the Trooper gnawed his chin-strap, then sheepishly
hung his head;
"Speak out, old chap!" said his comrades. With an
effort, at last, he said—
"I came to the front with my pals here, the boys, and
the brave old tars,
I've fought for my Queen and country, and rode with
the Tenth Hussars •
I'm proud of the fine old regiment!"—then the Colonel
Bnook his hand—
"So I '11 ask one single favour from my Queen and my
native land!
"There sits by your side on the Staff, Sir, a man we are
proud to own!
He was struck down first in the battle, but never was
heard to groan;
If I've done ought to deserve it,"—then the General
smiled "Of course,"—
"Give back to the Tenth their Colonel—the Man on the
old White Horse!
"If ever a man bore up, Sir, as a soldier should, with pluck,
And fought with a savage sorrow the demon of cursed ill-
luck—
That man he sits beside you! Give us back, with his
wounds and scars,
The man who has sorely suffered, and is loved by the
Tenth Hussars!"
Then a cheer went up from his comrades, and echoed
across the sand.
And was borne on the wings of mercy to the heart of his
native land,
Where the Queen on her Throne will hear it, and the
Colonel Prince will praise
The words of a simple soldier just uttered by Trooper
Hayes.
Let the moralist stoop to meroy, that balm of all souls
that live;
For better than all forgetting, is the wonderful word
"Forgive!"
A TALE OF THE TENTH HUSSARS!
When the sand of the lonely desert has covered the plains of strife,
Where the English fought for the rescue, and the Arab stood for his life;
When the crash of the battle is over, and healed are our wounds and scars,
There will live in our island story a Tale of the Tenth Hussars!
They had charged in the grand old fashion with furious shout and swoop,
With a " Follow me, Lads !" from the Colonel, and an answering roar from
the troop;
On the Staff, as the Troopers past it, in glory of pride and pluck,
They heard, and they never forgot it, one following shout, " Good luck!"
Wounded and worn ho sat there, in silence of pride and pain,
The man who'd led them often, but was never to lead again.
Think of the secret anguish! think of the dull remorse!
To see the Hussars sweep past him, unled by the old White Horse t
An alien, not a stranger: with heart of a comrade still,
He had borne his sorrow bravely, as a soldier must and will;
And when the battle was over, in deepening gloom and shade,
He followed the Staff in silence, and rode to the grand parade;
For the Tenth had another hero, all ripe for the General's praise,
Who was called to the front that evening by the name of Trooper Hayes;
He had slashed his way to fortune, when scattered, unhorsed, alone,
And in saving the life of a comrade had managed to guard his own.
The General spoke out bravely as ever a soldier can—
"The Army's proud of your valour: the Regiment's proud of their man!"
Then across that lonely desert, at the close of the General's praise,
Came a cheer, then a quick short tremble on the lips of Trooper Hayes.
"Speak out," said the kindly Colonel, "if you've anything, Lad, to say:
Your Queen and your dear old country shall hear what you've done to-day!"
HEAT AND LIGHT.
At a meeting of the National Patriotic War Whoop
Society, held on Monday last to enable one or two Noble-
men to deliver eloquent anti-Ministerial speeches, of
which the House of Lords was not worthy, that House
having strangely preferred going off to dinner instead of
listening to them, the following interesting letter was
read from Professor Tinderbox :—
"It would have given me, as a man of peace and Bcience,
a great deal of pleasure to attend your Meeting. I ooultt
have shown without any difficulty how well the scientific
system of the Division of Labour is illustrated when Plat-
form Oratory, Jingoism, and Chemistry meet in the same
person, and that an individual who has made a name as
a Philosopher deserves to be regarded as an authority on
Eastern politics. (Cheers.) I can assure you that during
the last few davs my blood has repeatedly reached the
boiling point, Fahrenheit, owing to the nefarious character
of Mr. Gladstone, whom, however, I, as a good Liberal,
regard with deep respect. A gentleman whom I met at
the bottom of a crevasse in a glacier near the Bel Alp, and
who had tasted no food for six days, recently told me that
he thought England was going to the dogs; I oontroverted
the opinion with some warmth at the time, but now I see
what a really accurate and original remark it was."
("Hear, hear.'")
'' But to return. The present Government is showing
strong signs of what I may perhaps call cretaceous degene-
ration: indeed, their continuance in office is the only argu-
ment I know against my friend Dabwin's doctrine of the
Survival of the Fittest. Providence, or that congeries of
forces which goes by the name, manifestly favours the
absorption of sandy deserts all over the Universe into the
broad bosom of the Empire. Excuse the unscientific
ardour of the expression, but I cannot refrain from ejacu
lating, 'Hurrah for our gallant Redcoats!' There is
nothing, let me assure your Meeting, in the least degree
inconsistent in a Scientific Materialist coming out as a
Political Sentimentalist of the deepest dye. Politics is,
in fact, that branch of my intellectual activities upon
which Nature compensates herself for the severe rationality
of Science." (Cheers.)

THE FOWLER SPREADS HIS NET IN VAIN!
There certainly was some degree of humour in the announcement that the Lord Mayor,
in accordance with his kindly and hospitable character, was about to ask the celebrities of the
House of Commons to a banquet at the Mansion House; and, in the thorough conviction that
generous fare and generous wine dispelled all ill-nature and ill-feeling, and induced wise and
reasonable men to seek rather for points upon which they could agree than for those on which
they differed, his guests were to be arranged as follows:—Mr. Gladstone and Lord Randolph
Churchill; Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Marriott; Mr. Newdegate and Mr. Bradlat/gh;
Mr. Forster and Mr. Parnelt,; Sir Wilfrid Lawson and Mr. Bass; Sir William Hab-
cottrt and Mr. Biggar; Sir Walter Carden and Mr. Firth; Mr. Bright and Mr. Labotj-
chx&e. Upon making inquiries, however, in the highest quarters, namely, his Lordship's
front kitchen, our Correspondent was informed that the replies received up to the present
time were of so unsatisfactory a character that it was feared the kind and thoughtful
intention would have to be abandoned.
DAYS OF DINNERS.
"Now, -when parties are entertained in well-
appointed Bporting country-houses in England,
or in shooting-lodges in Scotland, a succession of
meals, each partaking more or less of the charac-
ter of a dinner, occupies the attention of the
guests, with brief intervals for rest, from morning
hours till long past dewy eve."—Lady John
Manners, in the National Review.
Go read the National Review,
0 gormandising sinners,
And learn therein you should eschew
So many tempting dinners.
You eat and drink from morn till night,
With breakfast, dinner, luncheon,
Until you find your waistcoats tight,
Eacn man a human puncheon.
There's breakfast, with each tempting dish,
At early morning taken,
With flesh and fowl, and many a fish,
With kidneys, chops, and bacon.
There's luncheon, with the entrees warm,
Cold meat, and pies, and pickles,
With all the gourmet's eye can charm,
And all his palate tickles.
Then tea comes in the afternoon,
With shaves of bread and butter,
You with the ladies wield the spoon,
And round the muffins flutter;
Or if to liquor you incline.
And scorn the fragrant Hyson,

To name your special " pison."

To show the cook's resources:

The sequence of the courses.

Can wish for at the table;
With knife and fork you play your part,
'Mid conversation's Babel.
Dessert will follow, with each sort
Of fruit known to the era,
With claret, sherry, and with port,
Perchance some old Madeira.
Then coffee and a petit verre
Of brandy? That's the question;
Chartreuse, the yellow, men declare
Is best for your digestion.
And, after dinner, when you crowd
The pleasant room for smoking,
Cigars and pipes too are allowed,
And then's the time for joking.

Is certain to be drinking!

BRAVE SOLDIER BOYS!
"Many of the Troops that fought so well at El Teb were raw recruits."—Daily Paper. (F.M. Punch's Tribute to the Juxior United Service.)
BOW-WOW r. BOW-WOW.
When a Statesman's bounceably benignant,
When an Interest's furiously indignant,
When a Statesman's pigment proves all inky,
When the Interest's rose-pink looks too pinky;
When the Statesman as an Aj ax poses;
When the Interest swears its realm's all roses:
When the latter vows that interference,
Of its rights will make a general clearance,
Send the country straightway to the dickens ;—
Then that country of such nonsense sickens,
Knows the Statesman deals in Big Bow-Wow,
Knows the Interest's calculated row
Is half hollow bunkum, and decides
A sharp eye to keep both sides.

"COME UNTO THESE YELLOW SANDS 1"
Yes, we shall all have to come unto them, since an American,
Mr. Webb-Barber, has discovered a new cure for indigestion. He
prescribes a certain amount of sand to be taken with every meal.
Each portion of food is to be taken, not only cum grano salts, but
with a grain of sand as well. Sandwiches will doubtless form the
most popular item of light refreshment, and anything that's sandy,
or that happens to be grituitous will be eagerly devoured. Judges,
Senators, Storekeepers, Colonels, Carpet-baggers, and Ink-slingers
have all tried the new cure, and from being helpless hypochondriacs
they have become as jolly as Sandboys. A Company has been
formed for the purchase of Ramsgate Sands, and the inventor is
coming to England, where a number of grateful dyspeptios are going
to have his portrait painted by Mr. Frederic Sandys,

it to Mr. Melnotte, who writes Poetry himself."
Poetical Husband. "Not if I know it! Why, before I've quite
FINI8HED, HE'LL PULL OUT AND READ A. SoXXJST OF HW OWN)"
KILLING TIME.
Time is proverbially recognised as everybody's " Enemy." To kill,
if possible, everybody's Enemy,—to devour, as it were, old Edax
Rerum, in the largest possible mouthfuls, is plainly the duty of
everybody. What is known as "the time of the Country" is, of
course, the special object of the "devouring" zeal of all true lovers
of that Country. This obvious truth is recognised with sufficient
distinctness by our palavering patriots at St. Stephen's. Neverthe-
less, some rules, hints, and suggestions may not be without interest
for inexperienced aspirants to Parliamentary honours :—
For an Eloquent Premier.—Never limit yourself to one word
when two can possibly be used. Shun, as you would a pestilence or
an epigram, all monosyllables, especially " \ es " and " No." Remem-
ber that the comforting quality of "that sweet word Mesopotamia"
is probably due to its being polysyllabic. Cultivate that sensitive
testiness which is so great a stimulus of verbal flux. Expand an
answer to any question, no matter what or from whom, into an
oration. Take care in the course of such oration to furnish palpable
opportunities for further questions from captious catechisers, whom
direct brevity would have disarmed or defeated. Answer those
questions at still greater length. Even in deolining to answer a
particular question, or protesting vehemently and volubly against
its character, be sure to indulge in passionate prolixity. Never sit
contemptuously silent under the taunts of callow insolence or the
floutings of obstructive incompetence, even when their mischievous or
malicious purposes are exactly fulfilled by your indignant loquacity
of rejoinder or rebuke.
For a Leader of Opposition.—Whilst being—for obvious reasons—
careful not to commit yourself, personally, to palpable obstruotive-
ness, tolerate, when you do not actually promote it, among your less
responsible followers. When charged with doing so, angrily, and in
as many words as possible, repudiate the insinuation. Favour need-
less questions and purposeless debates,—purposeless and needless,
that is, from any other point of view than that of killing time.
Study and play upon the temperamental weaknesses of vour political
opponents, the loquacity of one, the irritability of another, the self-
complacent smartness of a third. Indulge in factitious defences of
disingenuous quibblings. Make the assumption of superior candour
and'righteous indignation the stalking-horse for insidious delay.
For a Budding Under-Secretary.—Never answer the simplest
question with courteous conciseness. Study to be "smart." Make
the extorted reply to take the form of an airy impertinence or a con-
temptuous snub. Be as provocative as possible when laconic, and as
prolix as you can when formally polite.
For a "Brilliant" Ministerial Magnifico.—Play7 the political
Salmoneus at every opportunity. Scatter your epigrammatic fire-
brands about whenever there is combustible material at hand. If
anyone pours oil on the troubled waters of debate, set fire to it, with
heated rhetorio and Hashing sarcasm. Bo bounceably caustic, and
ironically de haut en has.
For a Retired Colleague of a Ministry in Office.—Play the candid
friend whenever you can see a chance of doing so without posing as a
frank enemy. Say the nastiest things under cover of the nicest con-
sideration. Arm the Opposition with poisoned weapons to pierce your
old friends. Indulge in long academicial disquisitions and compre-
hensive confessions of faith whenever you see or can make an oppor-
tunity. Affecting superior conscientiousness, act the political
Joab in the manner best calculated to move your ancient opponents to
voluble jubilation, and your late colleagues to time-consuming retort.
-For an Opposition Free Lance.—Constitute yourself an incarnate
Note of Interrogation. Question everybody about everything, and
never be satisfied with any sort of answer whatever. Study news-
paper canards all day to pester the Ministry all night. Put every
interrogation in the most offensive possible form, and at as great
length as possible. Suggest an insult in every sentence, and imply a
falsehood in every remark. Make every cock-and-bull story you
can get hold of matter for a question, and if possible for a debate.
Profess inability to understand the plainest answer, and affect to
detect evasion in the most candid explanation. Aim ever at estab-
lishing a "raw," and peg away at it with the persistence of Io's gad-
fly. Bring baseless charges of nefarious conspiracy and villanous
motive. When these charges are clearly refuted, bring them again,
—and again. Make many speeches empty of pertinence, but chock-
full of puerile insolence. "Cheek" your intellectual and moral
"betters," in the hope that they may at length waste trouble—and
time—in castigating you. When you have tricked them into spend-
ing time on you, take more time in denouncing them for so spending
it. "Get up" some subject—Foreign Affairs, for choice—in the
same spirit as that in which the scribbler got up Chinese Metaphysios.
Put your historical and geographical hotch-potch into the form of a
speech, and demand explanation of non-existent difficulties, and
answers to idiotic inquiries. When your preposterous edifice of mis-
read data and false assumptions is knocked to bits, piece it together
again, and reproduce it at the next opportunity, so that more time
may again be spent in demolishing it. When you can do nothing,
fall back upon the inarticulate eloquence of noisy interruption.
Every superfluous "rise to order " occupies some minutes, an unsup-
ported contradiction consumes moments, and even howlings, in the
gross, take appreciable time.
For an Independent Member.—Trot out your special fad d tort et
d travers, and refuse to let the wheels of State move on until your
private hobby-horse has been duly paraded, or your particular cherry-
stone of crotchety opinion has been crushed or kicked out of the road.
These rules, deduced from the practice of Past-Masters in the art
of Parliamentary time-wasting, are, of course, only adapted to the
needs of Parliamentary tyros. They have been in full and fruitful
exercise at St. Stephen's for some years past. John Bull has had
abundant opportunity of studying their progress and their results.
Perhaps before long he may be moved to express in unmistakable
terms his opinion of their merits. If he does not, he will prove him-
self a more patient and thick-hided Issachar than Mr. Punch
credits him with being.
Peogeess of the Reform inaugurated at the Fisheries Ex-
hibition.—On Saturday last Cod was selling at the West End for
1j. 6d. per pound, and at the Central Fish Market retail for 3d. per
pound! This joke is too good to be omitted!
The "Real Pressure of the Rates."—The pressure brought to
bear on Her Majesty's Government by those who are continually
"rating" it.

FAWCETT TO FLORA.
[The Postmaster-General has been compelled to issue a proclamation
urging precaution in the sending of flowers through the Post.]
In the Spring the Liberal Party tries to do its level best,
In the Spring the wanton Tory makes himself a public pest;
In the Spring a heavier pressure eomes upon my hard-worked host;
In the Spring the Public fancies sending flowers through the Post;
So I say, my blooming Flora—and I mean it not as argot—
On that pretty practice I would not place a complete embargo;
But I really must impress upon your votaries, Goddess fair,
The necessity of caution, the propriety of oare.
Primroses when pressed go pappy, violets when squeezed get damp,
The Narcissus juice exudeth under pressure of the stamp.
Water is extremely grateful to the buds in gardens nodding
But the Post is discommoded by damp moss and soaking wadding;
Floral tricklings pulp epistles, and obliterate addresses,
Covent Garden in a post-bag makes the nastiest of messes.
Therefore, Madam, I entreat you, I implore you. as a friend,
Urge your votaries who floral tributes through the Post must send,
Just to pack them tightly, neatly, safe from leakage, fracture, loss,
With the maximum of caution, and the minimum of moss!
SLUMMING BEVEESED.

A Bough Sketch.
At a Meeting to inquire into the Sanitary Condition of London,
held at the " Cow in the Coffee-Pot," Milk Street, Clerkenwell, last
Saturday, there was a very large attendance, the
extraordinary number being doubtless due to the
interest with which the Report of Mr. BuGGlN8,who
has recently been slumming in the West
End of London, was looked forward to.
After a couple of songs, and the expulsion
of a gentleman who was under the alco-
holic impression that the Meeting had been
convened for a glove-tight, business v
commenced.
Mr. Buggins, who was received with
cheers, thanked his friends for the recep-
tion as how they had given him. It was
perfeotly true that he had reoently been
slumming—(groans)—he begged pardon, but if that wall-eyed son
of a baker hooted him again, he d kick him out of the place, and
show him who was which—he meant to say West-Ending;—
[cheers)—and he found that the accounts they had all heard of
how the rich lived were in no way exaggerated. He had gone
with his friends to Mayfair, where all the most blooming toffs, or
he should say real nobby swells hung out, and, owing to the
kindness of an old pal of nis who was footman there, he and his
friends got into the house while the owner was out, a-hunting or
a-shooting. {Groans.) It was a house dark and poky and stuffy,
where yon could smell the dinner all over the place all day long, ana
for this the toff paid over £200 a-year. (Groans.) To increase the
darkness and. stuffiness, this poor ignorant buffer, instead of nice
whitewash, which always looked clean and cheerful, and on which
you could write up anything you wanted to remember, or figure out
a sum, had hung up thick ourtains and matting. {Murmurs.) They
might grumble, Dut it was true, as he'd show one or two of them
when he got them outside. And just round the corner of this swell
house, with all its pictures and flowers about the place, till it looked
like the outside of a show at a fair— {laughter)—there was actually
stables, the smell of which came pouring into the house all day, for
these 'ere swells actually opened their winders whenever they could,
to get what they called fresh air. (Groans.) Well, he went up-
stairs, and there in each .bedroom he found a bath. ( Question f ")
It was true; and each of the people .in that house took a cold bath
every morning, and then wondered why they wasn't well. (Laughter.)
Other examples of the ignorance and discomforts of the rich he might
tell 'em, but his explorations were cut short by the toff himself
returning, and using most violent language. He sacked that poor
footman— (yells)—and if they hadn't been four of them, to roll nim
down-stairs, he would have got a policeman—(shrieks)—to take Jos
Sceoggins into custody, simply because poor Joe had put half-a-
dozen silver spoons in his pocket, to Bhow the Meeting as a memento
of their visit. (Cheers.) As to the absence of Joe Sceoggins
A small boy here entered the room to say that Mr. Schoqgins had
pawned the six spoons, and was a-standing treat all round at the
"Calf and Kid," upon which the Meeting immediately dispersed in
great disorder, but subsequently kept up festivities until closing-
time at the " Calf and Kid."

LOVE IN THE LIMELIGHT.
Am—Mr. Leslie's Popular Song.
Think not that love, if left alone,
Will run on smoothly—sweetly;
Or out of hobbles all its own
Withdraw itself discreetly.
Thus—to the purpose :—From his Stall
An inexperienced Chappie
A lime-lit Maiden longed to oall
His own, and make ner happy.
Chorus.
For he pined for fairy society—
She where she was would have stayed;
But he was a lordling, and she but a "Miss,"
And that a great difference made!
He asked her hand. She murmured " Yes!"
And even, most politely,
To spare his good Mamma distress,
Played fairies no more nightly.
She said, "His noble father fills
The Upper House with measures.
To know I'm daily in the bills
Cannot enhance his pleasures!"
Chorus.
Then she pined for higher society,
And there had willingly stayed;
For he was a lordling, and she but a Miss,
And that all the difference made.
'Twas settled. Still the Earl would oall
The match an infra dig. one,
And style the "tree " that graced his hall
"A rare—if not a big one."
He also urged that maid to part
With much in view of marriage;
He bade her first call in her carte
Before she kept her carriage!
Chorus.
Then he tested her fairy society,
Though owning he felt much afraid,
For his son was a lordling, and she a mere Miss,
And that such a difference made!
The time sped on. No more that_fay
Cut graceful fairy capers,
But got referred to every day
In fashionable papers.
And merry as a marriage-bell
All went, till scandal scorning,
Her Chappie—sorry truth to tell—
Backed out of it one morning.
Chorus.
For he now feared her fairy society,
At least, so to say, he was made;
But as he was a lordling, and she a Stage Miss,
The bill—if it oame—could be paid.
And so it ends! An action brought
The publio chatter feeding,
The while, within another Court,
That maid her cause is pleading.
And though that Chappie s deed to grace
There '11 be no wreath of laurel,
Twelve jurymen from out his case
Perchance may draw this moral:—
Chorus.
Whate'er be your lot in society,
Just stick to your own proper grade,—
And you '11 ne'er find yourself up a family tree,
—Or left out in the cold cruel shade!

A MATTER OF TASTE.
Dan*l Drvos, the piece recently reproduced at the Royal Court
Theatre, was originally played at the Haymarket some eight or ten
years ago, when it was not exactly a triumphant success. "Dan I
has come to judgment" a second time—with what result the future
will show. At present, however, the chief interest of the Sloane
Square audienoes seems to oentre m the appearance of Miss Finney-
Fortescue, a young lady whose name is wellkno wn'' in another place,"
to wit, the Queen's Bench Division of the Royal Courts of Justice.
Aocording to Mr. Broadley's book upon the Defence of Auadi,
Mr. Barnum offered the British Government any sum they pleased to
fix to be permitted to take the interesting captive as a show round the
provinces. Have the Lessees of the Court Theatre seen this passage
and improved upon the idea? It is worth noting, too, apropos of
this subject, that in the amusing afterpiece which concludes the
evening's entertainment, Mrs. John Wood sings once again the ever
popular "His heart teas true to Poll," with its refrain—
"'Tia no matter what you do,
If your heart be only true—
And his heart teas true to Poll!"
Perhaps it is intended by the Lessees that this ditty should now be
accepted as a topical song.

LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business.
To Mr. W. S. Wills, about the new Piece at the Prince's.
Mr dear "Wills,
I feel sure that you must be very anxious to learn how
your pupil in the art of dramatic construction, Henry Herman
(who, of course, you will remember, was associated with you in the
production of Claudian) gets on without your assistance. Your col-
laborates- has recently taken to himself a partner in the person of
Mr. Henry A. Jones. In fact, Herman, nitherto your man, has
now become his man. He has already had some dealings with his
present colleague, having written Silver King, or Silver Guilt (for
the moment I forget which), a piece which was received with con-
siderable favour. Having thus refreshed your memory, I proceed to
deal with Breaking a Butterfly, just produced at the Prince's.
Although the new work is said to be founded upon the Norah of
dear, amiable, old, tragedy-loving, mirth-provoking Ibsen (of course,
you know all about him), I cannot help feeling that Herman, profiting
by your lessons in con-
struction, has, 80 to
speak, run alone, with-
out accepting any help
is from the good-natured
Italian,Iiussian,Greek,
or was it Swedish r
o playwright, to whom I
have alluded. Herman
seems to have proceeded
upon the rule, "Take
care of the situations
at the end of the First
and Second Acts, and
the Third Act will look
after itself." Thus,
the Curtain falls for
the first time upon a
Bank-Manager dismis-
sing a dishonest Clerk,
who has his employer's
wife in his power, be-
cause that wife has
committed a forgery,
and, for the second
time, upon" that hus-
band taking the blame
of the forgery upon his

She Lingard by the Christmas Tree.
"Oh, such on artless thing!"
own shoulders, to the confusion of the dishonest Clerk, and the gratitude
of the guilty Lady. No doubt Herman, following your example in
the case of Claudian, when, of course, after constructing the piece,
you said to your colleague, There, my boy, there is my framework,
now write your poetry, has said to Jones, in his turn, "There, my
lad, I have given you the points, just like a good fellow, put in some
padding." The request has met with ready compliance, and thus we
have a strangely-conducted bank, where the Manager, at the request
of his wife, increases the salary of an old Clerk twenty pounds a-
year, out of their employers' money; a projected children's party,
whereat the hostess is to dance the Tarentella, in the costume of a
Neapolitan peasant; a Special Correspondent to a leading daily
journal, who writes his articles, dated St. Petersburg, in London
(this little touch, no doubt, was introduced to please Messrs. Sala,
Forbes, and Russell, and to secure good notices in the papers they
respectively represent); and, lastly, a Lady of so much innocence,
that she cannot see any harm whatever in forgery when it is com-
mitted " to save her father the trouble of writing his signature on his
death-bed." This Lady, although in the full bloom of mature woman-
hood, is accepted by all the characters in the piece as a young person
whose extreme frivolity is fully accounted for by her very tender
years. Thus, as the representative of the part dresses rather
young," and reminds one of the Tragedy Queens we see in the
Provinces, comparison is unavoidably challenged with the approaching-
to-middleaged heroine of Little Toddlekins. Next we have the old
Clerk, who crowns a long life of faithful service by robbing the dis-
honest employe—thus earning the hearty congratulations of his
official Chief, the Bank Manager. And there is a certain novelty
about the age of this old Clerk, which is worth noting. Apparently
to obtain a glass of wine from the Banker's wife, he tells ner that
he has been robbed of nine hundred pounds by the dishonest Clerk,
and is the more annoyed at the occurrence as he had saved this con-
siderable sum "by sixpences." Say he accumulated at the rate
of sixpence a-day, and began saving at sixteen, he must now be at
least one hundred and fifty odd years old! Then there is the confrere
of the Special Correspondents, who has such a lax Editor in Fleet
Street, and who is so like the modern Journalist! Lastly, there is
that he
has made nothing by his rogueries) Clerk, who looks and dresses like
the veriest and poorest caa that ever paraded the shadier parts of
Mile End or Whitechapel.
The scene of the play is laid in " the parlour of Humphrey God-
dard's house, adjoining Churchill JFfabershon's Bank." And, strange
as the Bank may be, the Bank customers must be stranger. Enter-
ing the establishment, which, we are told, is next door to a Cathedral
(no doubt it was once used as a Chapter-house), the most careless
observer must have been struck with the appearance of the Officials.
The Manager, who walks and talks like Mr. Irving, employs most
of his time in vaguely endorsing the back of a brief, the centenarian
Clerk wears no collar, and is evidently partial to sherry, while the
Cashier, as has already been hinted, may really be considered a
blot on the civilisation of the Nineteenth Century. No one but a
lunatic would deposit his money in such a Bank, and he only in the
well-founded belief that the owner of the establishment must be a
brother maniac.
And I think, my dear Wills, that you, with your keen sense of
humour, had you stiU been associated with Henry Herman, would
have insisted upon showing Mrs. Goddard's children's party. It
would have been very droll. It was to
have been held in the bank parlour,
wherein had been deposited a huge
Christmas-tree, sparingly decorated
with about a shilling'sworth of penny
toys and a half-guinea Punch. Al-
though a number of children were
expected (what a fight there would
have been amongst them to get that
disproportionately - valuable Punch-
doll !) only two guests had been actu-
ally invited in the presence of the
audience — the very - true - to - nature
Journalist and the centenarian Clerk.
Both these gentlemen were tempted to
accept the invitation by Little Toddle-
kins—I mean the Manager's wife—
promising to dance the Tarentella, in
the short petticoats of a Neapolitan
peasant, to amuse them, and, no doubt,
the other little ones. It must be
noted, however, that the Centenarian
received his card of admission weighted
with the condition that he, too, was to
appear in fanoy dress. Probably to
keep herself in countenance. Little
Toddlekins (I really forget what she
was called in the piece, but I mean the
Manager's wife) insisted upon her aged
friend—the promise was extorted from
him after he had swallowed a couple of D
dressed up in uniform as the late Duke of Wellington! I think
have said enough to show that had Mrs. Goddard's dance been given
as a finish to the Third Act, it would have " gone with roars!"
In conclusion, my dear Wills, after reading so far you will have,
very naturally, asked yourself, "But why Breaking a Butterfly f
Who was the butterfly, and when was he or she broken?" Quite
so. Well, I admit it is rather difficult to discover the reason for the
name of the piece. I don't think the Authors intended the Bank
Manager, Little Toddlekins, the true-to-nature Journalist, or the Bank
Manager's mother to be taken for the Butterfly. For a moment I
considered it possible that the Manager's sister might have been
indicated as the developed grub. But after calmly reflecting that
she had a very bass voice, and a rather painful autobiographical
anecdote about waiting one day to be married, and then suddenly
finding her bridegroom dead, I reluctantly discarded her claims to
the flitting-from-nower-to-flowery title. Then I thought to myself,
"The Butterfly was broken—broken! Ah! here's a clue to the
mystery! The caddy Clerk is the only person at the end of the piece
who is 'broken'; consequently, the caddy Clerk must be the Butter-
fly!" No doubt I am right. And yet when I think of the caddy
Clerk, with his seedy clothes, his hateful countenance, and his
slouching manner, I cannot help feeling that had Messrs. Herman
and Jones searched a little more carefully, they might have found a
more appropriate representative for the part.

ROOM OR COMPANY?
The following advertise-
mental puzzle appears in the
Sussex Daily News :—
TTNFURNISHED ROOMS,
vj for University man and
wife, in family of similar standing.
The "University man and
wife" will hare, we should
imagine, some difficulty in
getting suited. It would save
considerable trouble if thej
would not only mention their
University, but College—the
wife was probably at Newn-
ham or Girton—and then there
would be some chance of a
family being found to match.
But we should imagine they
would be far more likely to
find a family in unfurnished
rooms (though how a family
could exist in unfurnished
rooms, especially when the
"University man and wife"
required them, we are unable
to understand) than unfur-
nished rooms in a family.
Signs of the Season.
Now the birds all pair.

And be not too bitter.

And the crocus rises;

FIRST-NIGHT WRECKERS.
Sib,—Shakspeare did some good things, but I do hate to hear
people talking as if there was nothing more in the sea because one
big fish once swam in it. There are lots of people who could and
would write fine plays for the delectation of an appreciative Publio,
but for the danger of the proceeding. I've got a whole cupboard-
ful myself of splendid plays. But none of these brilliant efforts
have ever seen the footlights, and never will; for, though I'm a
boldish man, I'm afraid ofthe ordeal!
I fear the " First-Night Wreckers." Bless you, I know the rascals
by sight, having watched their tricks many and many a time when
the fate of a promising new Comedy was hanging in the balance.
Impudent young jackanapses they are, as they sell their yards of
silk behind the counter all the week through, smiling sweetly; mis-
chievous, dangerous young varmints of a Saturday- night, when, their
screw in their pocket, they say one to another, Let's have a glass
of old and bitter, and go and damn a play." The young scamps con-
gregate in or about the first row of the Pit, squatting in groups,
and if there's a hitch or a moment of uncertainty, they give a
view-halloo, and start helter-skelter in full cry. In other words,
they look out for squalls, and amuse themselves by fanning a breeze
into a tempest. Sometimes the House hushes them down; then
thev growl, and go sulkily to sleep, deprived of their fun.
Woe to the Author if he has written lines that oan be twisted into
a double meaning. "Cackle, cackle!" go the geese,—and " Hiss,"
too, as such sapient fowls will, when spiteful. I've listened to their
talk before the rising of the Curtain—before they could possibly know
anything about the promised entertainment—and pretty things I've
heard 'em say. More. I've seen one of the gentry in a corner, from
whence he could not possibly see the Stage, with his eyes shut and
his chin buried in his breast, hissing like a kettle on a hob. I've
heard one observe to another (this is absolutely true), "Snooks's last
effort was a fizzle; we '11 .have a lark this evening." And so it
comes about that Managers, Actors, Authors, talented Artists, and
earnest and hard-working Gentlemen, are put upon the rack—
ridiculed, flouted, msiJted—by a parcel of ignorant youths out of
the shops, and " made a sport (if you'll allow me to be poetio) " to
adorn a draper's holiday."
No, Sir! Not for me. Until the destroying vagabonds who, like
the Mohocks, find their pleasure in the infliction of pain upon others,
are hooted out of the Pit, I prefer to remain
One of the Unacted.
Too Oood to be True.
At the public examination of a debtor in Exeter, the other day,
we were told the shorthand writers present " gave the receiver to
understand that they had made up their minds as a body throughout
the country not to accept the scale of remuneration allowed by the
Bankruptcy Act." All strikes we know spread. Supposing all the
shorthand writers struck? The prospect is too delicious! No Par-
liamentary Reports, no record of political stumpings, no chronicle of
wordy after-dinner orations! We do not like strikes as a rule, but
a stenographic strike would be a cause of intense jubilation to most
newspaper-readers. But alas! the matter has since been adjusted.

SSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 3.—" Thought it would
come to this," said the Doorkeeper, as he gently hut firmly led the
Gentleman out. Gentleman had been attempting to address the
House from the Speaker's Gallery: well known to be contrary to
law. Had some in as usual at Question Time, taken his seat
right in centre, and observed proceedings with usual keen interest.
"Mad, quite mad," he muttered, when Wilfrid Lawson found
opportunity for Conservatives to go on the rampage on Egyptian
question. "Wonder they let these sort of nighty persons into the
House. Talk about Redistribution of Seats! What we want is
Redistribution of Members, some of them being left outside."
Was not, however, till Randolph appeared that the Gentleman
began to attract general attention. Randolph, excited beyond
measure by iniquity of Government, who after six nights' debate on
policy in Egypt will not at interval of three days make further series of
long speeches explaining the thrice-explained policy. With foot well
out and manly forefinger wagging at trembling Premier, Randolph
roared. Gentleman in the Gallery began to work his forefinger.
"Where," cried Randolph, throwing up his right arm, "is the
Right Honourable Gentleman the Member for Birmingham ?'' (Gen-
tleman in Gallery threw up his right arm as if he was on same sema-
phore system as Randolph). "And where," Randolph thundered,
"is the Member for Merthyr?"
Up went Randolph's left arm pointing to avenging glass roof. Up
went left arm of Gentleman in Gallery. An arm each aid for Bright
and Richard; but when Randolph returned to the Premier, both
arms went up, and tearing to pieces a page of his notes, he strewed
the fragments on the floor. This was too much for Gentleman in
the Gallery. Standing up, flinging both arms np, clenching his
hands and wringing them as if he would tear them to pieces and cast
them on the floor, he cried out, "Mr. Speaker, Sir, don't"
Here Address ended. Rule of House which limits speech to one
Member at a time already strained. Randolph and Premier
nagging at each other aeross floor. Really couldn't have anonymous
Gentleman joining in from Speaker's Gallery. So elderly Mes-
sengers, always kept in training for Bradlat/gh, appeared on scene,
ana led him forth.
_" Knew how it would be," one of the Doorkeepers moaned, shaking
his head ruefully. "Deoent a man as y'ever saw when he first
came. Sat through the six nights' Debate on Vote of Censure.
Could see he was beginning to grow shaky. Came on again with Debate
on Franchise Bill. Mind evidently tottering. Warned him, but no
use. Came again to-night, and there y'are. Nobody can stand it.
Would have been in Bedlam myself years ago, only for my mate taking
turns about." Business done.—County Suffrage Bill brought in.
Tuesday.—Dreadful rumour about the House to-night. Said Lord
Mayor Dawson, tempted by the paltry pittance of a Government
office, is about to abandon Imperial Politics, and take to Collecting
Rates. Sensation something like what would follow on news that
Bismarck was going into the Bathing-machine business, or Glad-
stone setting up as a Timber Merchant.
Whether seated on Front Bench below Gangway in Lord Mayoral
robes, so that nothing might obstruct view of his scarlet cloak,
his golden chain, his Damascene blade, and his massive lower limbs
in velvet shorts and silk stockings; whether demolishing the Govern-
ment, or pouring contempt on Parma and on Spain (meaning Lord
Claud Hamilton and Lord Crichton); whether with gracious
humility quoting the opinion of "One more illustrious than I";
whether describing his descent on Derry with graphio gorgeousness
of phrase that Macattlay might have envied; or whether simply
sitting listening in the costume of the period, with one leg crossed,
arms folded, and falcon eye fixed on the foe, the ex-Lord Mayor is
exquisite. If he wants £1,200 a-year, let us subscribe it, and keep
him with us. Dawson's colleagues indignant at report. If there's
£1,200 a-year going begging, general opinion that it isn't fair Dawson
should have it. Several been in the House longer than him, and
made much more noise.
Debate on Young Balfour's Motion on Housing of Poor. Sir
Sydney Waterlow back again after going round the world in search
of information on question. Has watched the housing of the poor in
Chinese quarter of San Francisco, spent an evening wandering through
the purlieus of Tokio, seen how the poor live on the Canton River,
studied Malay house-architecture at Singapore and Penang, and
hutted with the humble Indian on the sterile plains by Allahabad.
"Waterlow's quite at high-water mark on this subject," Dilke
said, listening to nis speech. Elsewhere uneasy feeling that since
matter has been referred to Royal Commission waste of time to be
debating it at length. Still speeches ready and must be delivered.
Business done.—None.
Wednesday.—Amid uproarious applause from Mr. Harrington.
Sexton delivered stupendous speech. Began at four o'clock; finished
at five. Might as well have gone on tiil seven, only House usually
rises at six on Wednesdays.
"An incoherent assemblage of sentences distantly connected by
chain of vituperation" is Mr. Gibson's description of Sexton's
peculiar form of oratory.
It is certainly remarkable, but it greatly pleased Harrington,
more especially when Sexton genially alluded to Irish Landlords as

"igits," and abused the Solicitor-General for Ireland for being
"not only dumb but absent." Curious how Irish Members always
go for Irish Solicitor-General, who is generally a dull but other-
wise blameless man.
Cause of the rumpus was Parnellites want to amend the Land Act
by taking away whatever it left to Landlord. Trevelyan puts his
foot down and says "No!" whereupon Sexton appears, and (of
course in Parliamentary sense) accuses the Solicitor-General for
Ireland of depriving his mother-in-law of bread. That seems to
settle the matter. Bill thrown out and everybody goes home.
Business done.—Land Law (Ireland) Act Amendment Bill rejected
by 235 votes against 72.
Thursday.—There happening to be no work for Parliament to do
just now, no important Bills requiring consideration, resolved to have
another night with Egyptian Question. Lord Burt led off in
Lords. Colonel Stanley reoommenced in Commons. Really astonish-
ing, and highly oreditable to command over facial musoles, the way
Hon. Gentlemen and Noble Lords come up to the scratch. Been in
session over a month. Not a sitting passed without shower of ques-
tions on affairs in Egypt. Five nights' debate on the Vote of Cen-
sure. Seven other nights of debate irregularly sprung upon the
House. In Lords, Granville declares he has answered question
fifteen or sixteen times. Yet here to-night, in freshest paint and
with every appearance of wanting to know, comes Lord Burt in the
Lords with "theMABKis" to follow; and in the Commons Colonel
Stanlet with both hands resting on the table, standing on one leg,
and swinging the other backwards and forwards whilst he asks,
""What is your policy in Egypt?"
Habtington, with crushed manner and in wearied voice, goes all
through business once more. Gladstone the only man still lively on
the matter. Once more expounds his policy, and then marching in
melancholy single file comes the old procession carrying a banner
with the too-familiar device "What's jour policy in Egypt?"
"Might as well shut up the place and go home, says Habtington.
"As a farce it wasn't very good on first night, and since then never
been off the bills. "We 're sick of it. If we 're to have obstruction, I
prefer old style; a long wrangle, a sudden explosion, and O'Donnell
put out, or Joseph Gillis discovered up in Strangers' Gallery grinning
down upon an assembly temporarily bereft of bis companionship.
Business done.—None.
Friday.—A little tired of House to-night. "Went and sat in
Ladies' GaUery. Looked down on bear-pit, where they quarrelled
round Chamberlain's passive figure. Question is, Was patronage
under Bankruptcy Act distributed among political partisans?
Chamberlain conclusively shows it was not. _ On contrary, quite
unusual pains taken to secure best men. Tories a little staggered.
After hesitation, determine to go on. Press for Committee, and are
beaten two to one.
"Well, now," said Miss Crocker, one of those charming girls
America occasionally sends over to Redress the Balance between the
Old World and the New, "they talk about party squabbles in
my country, but I suppose this is about the meanest thing your
Opposition ever did?
Don't like to admit it to a stranger; but in privaoy of Diary may
say it is. I give up Joseph Gillis, Georgy Hamilton, Grand
Cross, and some other Gentlemen on Front Bench. 'Tis their nature
to. But to see Colonel Stanlet and Gibson going out to vote with
their party in this pitiful spiteful personal attack, astounds me.
Business done.—None.
BEFORE AND AFTER THE DINNER.
The Lord Matob, in proposing the toast of the evening on the
occasion of the recent City banquet given in honour of Lord Shaftes-
burt, announced to the assembled company that his original idea had
not been to preside at a grand and costly public entertainmentof the
kind at which they were then assisting, but at quite a private and
homely little affair of a very different character. It is, however, only
known to a select few that this earlier and more economical social
gathering really was essayed and came off. As the speeches of guest
and host on the occasion were naturally of a very simple and
informal character, they mav perhaps be read with interest by those
to whom the sudden rush made by the City with its Freedom literally
at the head of the veteran philanthropic Nobleman, is yet somewhat
of a mystery. Subjoined is the hitherto unreported account of the
proceedings:—
At the Mansion House yesterday afternoon a chop-and-hot-potato
lunch was given by the Lord Mayor (R. N. Fowler, M.P.) to the
Earl of Shaftesbury and some half-dozen personal friends who had
expressed a wish to have a good uninterrupted stare at his Lordship.
After the usual loyal toasts had been duly proposed and honoured,
the Lord Mayor said he had now to drink to the health of his dis-
tinguished guest. He thought, as they were practically quite alone,
he could afford to be frank with the Noble Earl, and tell nim how it
came about that he had asked him to look in and have lunch at all.
The matter was very simple. He had, during his year of office, to
have what he might colloquially style an occasional " flare up," but
it was absolutely necessary if he desired a flare up to get nold of
"somebody " just to flare up with. (Laughter.) Now.the abnormal
and extraordinary dearth of "somebodies" at the present moment
obliged him to take up his Whitaker, and see whether he could put his
finger on any one who might be said to be ripe for the Freedom of the
City. He was not particular, not he;—a second-hand explorer would
have done,—but unfortunately he could hit on nobody. Then he
appealed in despair to the City Remembrancer. That functionary,
who never seemed to remember anything or anybody, told him he
must wait for "somebody home from Egypt," but he, the Lobs
Mayor, knew what Egyptian affairs meant, and the Ninth of next
November might be here first, and that wouldn't do for Aim. (" Hear,
hear ! ") Then a happy thought struck him all at onoe. He said
to himself, "Why! bless me!—if there isn't old Shaftesbury!
(Laughter). "Why, they ought to have made something of him forty
years ago' But, better late than never: he's the very thing for me!
All this Dwelling of the Poor business to the fore just now: and the
Prince on the Commission too! By Jove, I will. J 11 ask him to
lunch!" And that, concluded his Lordship, addressing the Noble
Earl, is why you are here to-day, my Lord! (Loud laughter.)
The Earl of Shaftesbury, who on rising was received with an
encouraging cheer, said: My Lord Mayor, and you two or three
Gentlemen here assembled, I have very little to say in reply to your
frank, but, I may add, not altogether pleasing little harangue; for
you have reminded me—unintentionally, no doubt—of the fact that
had not, I confess, occurred to me before,—namely, that to come
bothering a man of my years at this advanced period of his life with
the offer of a visionary sort of honour that would have come with
far better grace a quarter of a oentury back, is in rather question-
able, I might even say in rather clumsy taste! (" No, no.' ) "What
is the use, I ask, of the Freedom of the City to me? (A Voice—
"You can go up the Monument for nothing ! ") Just so. But that
and the other numerous privileges conferred by the distinction, are
not of a character to tickle the fancy of one who, like myself, has
reaohed his eighty-fourth year, and passed most of the time in, I
trust, no very frivolous spirit. ( Hear!") And how do you
confer the honour, after all? You ask me to a little—I say it
with all respect—a little twopenny-halfpenny entertainment that
I have frequently seen equalled—nay, sometimes eclipsed—by
the modest luncheon-tariff at my own Club. (Laughter.) Gentle-
men, the noble Earl went on to say, might laugh, but he should have
thought that the laugh was entirely on his side. Had his worshipful
host asked him to meet some three hundred representative guests,
and invested the whole proceedings with a decent, but seasonable
eclat, that would possibly have altered the circumstances of the case,
and have, while paying a tardy compliment to himself, at least have
given a sort of temporary stimulus to the cause for which he had
laboured, and which, if he got a good two columns in the Times to
himself, he would make them thoroughly understand he embodied.
(Cheers.) As it was, he felt much inclined to ask them to let him
alone. ("No, no.'") He meant it. (Laughter.)
On its being explained to bis Lordship that " The Freedom of the
City" included free admission to all the East-End Music-Halls, a
season ticket at the City of London Theatre, the right of lunching at
Crosby Hall for a quarter of the usual tariff, the privilege of taking
friends at all hours to see the exterior of the Monument, of visiting
the Docks (including that at the Old Bailey) without any ceremony
and in any state his Lordship pleased, with various additional
privileges, such as the right to the first cut off the joint at the Old
London Tavern, real turtle at somebody else's expense at Painter's,
and four-penn'orth of whiskey for threepence anywhere within the
precincts of the City,—on all this having been fully explained to
him, the Noble Earl expressed bis regret still more strongly that
"The Freedom of the City " had not been conferred on him about
forty years ago, but added that " It was better late than never, and,
if the Lord Mayor would only take him the rounds just to start
him, he looked forward to spending many a jolly evening in the full
enjoyment of the new Liberty just conferred upon him."
The Lord Mayor agreeing to this, a pleasant little party was
formed, and, after the banquet, a thoroughly convivial evening was
passed, and visits were paid to the various places of amusement,
within the Freedom of the City. Cabs and broughams awaited them
at the City boundary, marked by the Griffin, where, after three
cheers, rather indistinctly given, for " Freedom and Fowler!" they
were escorted to their separate vehioles by the City Police, and
reached their homes (according to distance) between two and three
a.m., the finish-up with a stirrup-cup and a saraband at the Mansion
House havingdetained them somewhat later than had been expected.
The Noble Earl says he is delighted with the Freedom of the City,
but that he had rather a headache next morning. He hopes
frequently to avail himself of the new privilege, and to take the
Hon. Evelyn Ashley with him on Wednesday nights.

It will be noticed with considerable surprise, not to say indignation, that
although there are to be Volunteer gatherings for the purposes of "instruc-
tion in tactics" at Aldershot, Portsmouth, and Chatham, the Metropolis, as a
scene of operations, has been entirely neglected. To rectify this astounding
omission, the following " General Idea" (suggested by a similar document rela-
tive to Portsdown Heights) is furnished, with the request that it may be imme-
diately adopted by the Authorities in Pall Mall.
General Idea.
A Western Force is marching from Hounslow, with a view to seizing the
Chelsea Bunhouse, after burning the principal shop for the sale of Maids-of-
honour at Richmond. The Commander of a Northern Force at Camden Town
resolves to endeavour to intercept this movement.
Operations of Friday, April 11.—The Advanced Guard of the Northern
Force having reached South Kensington by Brompton and Islington omnibuses
the previous evening, arrives in*, the neighbourhood of Putney, covering
tol. ixrrvi. n
the roads leading to Barnes Common with empty beer-
bottles.
Operations of Saturday, April 12.—The Advanced
Guard of the Northern Foroe occupy the Westminster
Aquarium during the Variety Entertainment. Then,
leaving the "Club Dinner" on their right, they drive
the ticket-clerk of the St. James's Park Station in under
shelter of his pigeon-hole. Next they visit numerous
taverns on the line of route. Having thus created a
diversion, they invade Rochester Row, and pass the rest of
the night and Sunday at the Police-Station. The Western
Foroe, which, in like manner, had occupied a similar post
at Kensington, are bailed out during the night.
Operations of Monday, April 14.—The Western Force
endeavours to carry out its object by chartering a
pleasure-van for SunDury. The Members of the Kempt on
Park Club oppose this attack: by calling in the assistance
of the Police. The Northern Force endeavours to prevent
the junction.
General Instructions.—The Western Force is re-
presented by Volunteers and other persons who happen to
nave nothing particularly to do at Easter. The Northern
Force is represented by Volunteers and other persons
who are similarly constituted to the members of the
Western Force. The Tower of London is supposed to
be non-existent. The Suspension Bridge at Battersea
is supposed to be protected by a tete-du-pont which
prevents it being destroyed by Artillery-fire. It is
supposed that there is no half-price at the Globe Theatre.
Charges for Infantry (except when in arms) will be made
by aU the Officials of the London General Omnibus
Company. At the conclusion of the Manoeuvres, the
whole of the troops will take each other by surprise, by
going to bed—quietly. Vivat Regina! No money
returned.
PITY THE POLICE!
[Mr. Shibl, one of the Hammersmith Magistrates, has fined
two Nursemaids for wheeling perambulators on the footpath.]
It's terribly hard upon Pleeoe-
man X,
And quite against his natur,
A servant gal in the street to

And " oop" her perambula-
tor.

For you and Matilda

For Mr. Shiel he has fined you both,

A horrible law revealing,
But think of the member of the Foroe
Who took you, and his feeling!
And where, I ask, are the kids to go?
If Mr. Shtxl is willing,—
Why into the roadway; yest just so,
Like lambs all ready for killing.
The omnibus and the brewer's dray,
And rollicking hansom cabbies,
Will most assuredly maim and slay,
Each hour, some precious babbies.
So change the law, for as I'm a man
With views and I'm proud to state 'em,
I '11 never meddle with Makt Ann,
And that's my ultipomatum.
A REASONABLE EXPLANATION.
At Tamanieb, we are told, Osman Diona's fierce
hordes rushed out of the ravine where they had been
lodged, as though they had been madmen. Probably they
madmen, poor fellows!
If it is a question of "Cremation r. Incrimination,''
the possible poisoners will vote for Cremation.

In a case of daffodil-stealing heard at the Woolwioh
Police Court the other day, we read the following report
of what the Magistrate said to the Prosecutor, whose

"Mr. Balout: Last year when you told me that a few of
the«e yellow flowers were worth three shillings, I disbelieved
you, but I made inquiries and found that you were right. I
iin glad to hare the opportunity of apologising."
It is hard to believe that the magisterial mind should
take a year to find out the value of daffodils. But if the
value had been discovered sooner, we cannot understand
why the apology was not tendered earlier. However, it
is better late than never, and k will probably have the
effect of fixing the market value of daffodils in the
neighbourhood of Abbey Wood.

MANNERS; OR, A
DIFFICULTY.
SOUTH-EASTERN
The Kent Argus, with its watchful eyes ever open, reoently re-
ported how a deputation appointed by the Dover Town Council
interviewed the Joint Committee of the London, Chatham, and
Dover and South-Eastern lines in order to obtain greater facilities
of intercommunication between Shorncliffe and Margate.
Mr. J. S. Forbes, the energetic Chairman of the London, Chatham,
and Dover line, quite agreed with the Deputation, and said that his
Company was in no way responsible, and that he for his part was
ready to act in the most brotherly way towards Sir Edward
Watktn's line, if Sir Watkin would only let him.
The Deputation wouldn't be put off by Lord Brarourne, who
pleaded Sir Watkin's absence on the Continent as a reason for not
giving an immediate reply, but declared that if they did not receive
a definite answer by Thursday the 20th they would appeal to Parlia-
ment.
The present state of the trains "in correspondence11 between Rams-
gate and Dover is a most perfect exemplification of "How not to do
it" with as much show of "doing it" as possible.
The distance is something between seventeen and twenty miles.
But anyone, staying at Ramsgate, and struck by the happy thought
of running over to Dover and crossing to Calais and so on to
Boulogne, just "to make a day of it," returning next morning, will
meet with little encouragement from the two Companies whose lines
are cast in such pleasant, places, and who might sing with the
Ethiopian minstrel—
"0 if wo two could agree
What a happy couple we should be!"
The J aunty Tourist will naturally reason thus: "I am only seventeen
miles from Dover: there is a direct line: the South-Eastern takes me
from Ramsgate to Deal, the L. C. & D. from Deal to Dover, and as
the L. C. & D.'s boats for Calais start from Dover Pier, evidently
the trains wiU be so arranged as to enable passengers to catch the
mail boat at 9*40, or the midday boat at 12: though, as I am off for
an outing, the 9 "40 wiU be better for me. Let me consult the Time
Table of the two Companies. How convenient! What a sweet thing
it is for Railway Companies to dwell in unity!" and forthwith he
procures the Time Table.
First the Joyful Tourist looks for a through train from Ramsgate
to Dover. "Ah!" he exclaims, "here it is—12'13—but stop I " and
it suddenly occurs to him that, as the second and last boat of the
day leaves Dover at 12, i.e., a quarter of an hour before he starts from
Ramsgate, (his won't do. Evidently the two Companies are of opinion
that no one at Margate or Ramsgate can possibly want to start for
Dover before 11'52 from the one place, ana 12'13 from the other, or
could have any kind of objeot in being in Dover before 1*45, and so
this is the only direct through train in the morning, and 7'50 from
Margate, 8'5 from Ramsgate arriving at Dover 9"36, is the only after-
noon train.
Our Supposed Tourist, being up to his work and being able to pass
a first-class exam, in Bradshaw, is not going to be beaten by such a
difficulty as this, and being determined to get from Ramsgate to
Dover in time for the morning boat at 9*40, he procures the S. E.
Guide and the L. C. & D. Guide, and, like the gentleman who wrote
| on " Chinese metaphysics," he "combines the information."

Pitman (compassionately). "Ah!—I 8KB—that wbetched Drink!" [Explanations!
"Here you are!" he cries, joyfully, as the 8'25 train from Ramsgate
catches his eye (which is about all this train is intended to catch).
'' Capital! only seventeen miles to Dover! we must be there by 9'20 and
have twenty minutes to spare before embarking. Let me see"
His countenance gradually falls as he examines the Time Table
more and more attentively. This is the result.
The 8-25 from Ramsgate arrives at Deal at 9. So far so good. But
"J'y suit, j'y reste " may be that traveller's motto as far as any
getting to Calais by that mail-boat at 9'40 is concerned, as there is no
train on to Dover till 10. This gives an hour to wait at Deal. The
tourist will then arrive at Dover at 10"27, and he can go by the next
boat, for which he will have an hour and a half to wait. Of course
such an arrangement is admirably calculated to suit any one who
wants to step an hour at Deal and an hour and a half at Dover.
The 1'30 from Ramsgate arrives at Deal at 2'10 just in time to
catch the 215 for Dover which arrives at 2-42, but this the traveller
only accidentally hears of, as it doesn't seem to be advertised.
Perhaps it is meant as a pleasant little surprise. Should he miss the
surprise train, the traveller to Dover will have ample time to investi-
gate the town of Deal, as he will have no chanoe of "getting any
forrarder," until 4-18. This arrangement is favourable to the Tourist
who wishes to remain in Deal for a couple of hours. The 6*50 p.m.
from Ramsgate arrives at Deal at 7'30, just in time to miss the 7'15
from Deal to Dover. The 9"20 p.m. for Ramsgate arrives at Deal
10"5 just in time to miss the 10 o'clock train from Deal,—and then the
Tourist is done.
Sunday brings some oonsolation for the Tourist. He can catch the
early boat from Dover by starting from Ramsgate at 7. He will
have fifty minutes to wait at Deal, where, as the refreshment-room
won't be open, and no hotel is ready to receive visitors, he can spend
his time in imagining what he might have had for breakfast if he
had been compelled to wait this time while travelling abroad. He
will be at Dover by 8"57, and here, perhaps, he may get some break-
fast. At all events, as we believe the mail-boat goes at 9'40 a.m. as
on week-days, he can catch that, when, perhaps, breakfast will be
l also catch the mid-day boat on Sundays very
comfortably by leaving Ramsgate at 9 "45, and waiting only ten
minutes at Deal, and reaching Dover at 11*19, when, as a bona-fide
traveller, some hotel may oonsent to serve him with breakfast; but,
on the other hand, they may not, or may be so slow in placing it on
the table, that by the time it is there the hungry Tourist can only
pour the coffee into a flask, put the rolls and butter in one pocket,
the eggs-and-bacon into another, dash down five shillings, and rush
off to the boat, which starts punctually at 12 to the minute.
Certainly the Representatives of Margate, Ramsgate, Dover and
Shorncliffe have just cause of complaint, and as Mr. J. S. Forbes has
declared plainly and emphatically that he is on the side of the com-
plainants in the matter, it is to be hoped, in the interests of the travel-
ling public, which after all are the true interests of both Companies,
that Sir Watkin will not be obdurate; that he will listen to the voice
of reason; that he will like Cox embrace Box as his long-lost
brother (" Have you an L. C. D. & 8. E. marked on your armP" No!
Then it is he 11"); and that then their "friends in front will be happy"
"when," to quote Chairman Fosses, " there shall be frequent trains
—ten each way per day—at reduced fares, in accordance with the
terms of the letter Bent to the Dover Corporation, a copy of which had
been submitted to the S. E. Company."
Arrange this matter, Gentlemen, if you please, so that the much-
vexed Tourist residing at Margate or Ramsgate may be enabled to
avail himself of your Calais-Douvres and your Mail and other Packet
Service, and may not have to join in chorus, to the tune of " The
Whale,"—
"But we did not catch that Mail, Brave boyi,
We did not catch that Mail!"

THE BLACK WATCH."
(According to some French ideas on the subject of our Army Organisation.)
SIGNOR MACBETTO; OR, WITCH—IT ISN'T!
At the recent inaugural meeting of the Brand New Shakspearo Society con-
siderable interest was aroused by the announcement that a preliminary lecture
with the above significant title was to be delivered by the distinguished Italian
tragedian who had. just accepted the post of honorary Vice-President; and the
gathering of members was therefore unusually large.
On Signor Sai.vin; taking his position on the platform, on which apparently
to assist him in the illustration of his subject some extremely humorous panto-
mime heads, a down's dress or two, a vampire trap, a life-sized and coloured
plaster oast of a Scotchman taking snuff, and a few other necessary trifles were
tastefully arranged, he said: He trusted that the worthy object he had in view,
namely of proving to a British public that in the estimate they had formed of the
great Thane whose character it would be his business to dissect and truthfully
portray, they had hitherto been hopelessly abroad, had been already fairly
indicated in his recent embodiment of the part on the boards of Covent Garden
Theatre. But he would, as was his wont, delay no longer, but dash at once in
medial res.
"Now," continued the distinguished lecturer, "what was the true basis of
Macbeth's character P" He had no hesitation in saying it,— Sumin meant
his colossal human masterpiece to be a tremendous wag. The real explanation
of all the Scottish Thane's portentous troubles was an overweening and unre-
strained taste for practical joking. Take his entry upon the scene in Act 1.
How does he come on? Walking about alone with Banquo, on a blasted heath,
—preceded, an intensely humorous idea,—by some one with a drum. And what
of the very first line he utters P It contains a regular poser for his companion.
"So foul and fair a day I have not^seon,"
is the remark Macbeth makes to Banquo, who has evidently heard so much of this
sort of inconsequent foolery all the morning, that he aotually doesn't vouohsafe any
reply to it, buk turning away, asks the Witches the way to Forres! And now
about these Witches I It is true that they give Macbeth opportunities for
introducing some of his vary funniest business;—and one thing is clear from the
text—they wear large pasteboard heads.
"Speak, if you can,"
says Macbeth, naturally enough taking them for Pantomime Supers—and
doubting if they have been entrusted witn a line. And then again, when they
have got out a few words apiece, it is evident that they have delivered them
through the conventional hole in the chin, and necessarily
with much indistinctness, for he oontinues—
"Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more."
There is, therefore, no room to doubt but that the Witches
come in to the play for the purpose of getting what is
technically called a good " screamer" or two out of it.
And yet this question suggests itself to the oonsoientious
Critio, who is going also to play Macbeth,—why should
not Macbeth himself have got that laugh P In a word,
did not Shakspeare put the Witches in to oblige the
Management, who had three heavy salaries doing
nothing? and were not all their lines abstracted from the
leading part in which they were originally written t
The more the matter is looked at in this light, the
more it is evident. Macbeth must originally have had all
the Witches' business, their lines, Hecate's song, descrip-
tion of cauldron, and, in fact, evervthinp—in his part,
and have told it as a good story to his friends, probably
after supper, at the Banquet Scenft. This alone would
explain Lady Macbeth's manner to the gnests, who
have clearly been terribly bored with the reoital, and are
probably on the move in consequence.
"Think of this, good Peers,
But as a thing of custom; 'tis no other;
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time,"
she exclaims, apologetically—" He will do it," she seems
to say, and when her talkative Lord, amidst boisterous
guffaws of laughter, begins to catalogue the ingredients
of the cauldron, and she finds she cannot manage to keep
him quiet, with an impatient—
"Really—he grows worse and worse"
she dismisses the company.
Now this is so obvious, that I have, as I hinted, cut
out all the Witch business, and restored the lines to their
original place in the part of the leading Actor. Also, on
the same definite principle, I have given him Macduff's
best bits, by letting him tell the Doctor what he has heard
Macduff has said to Malcolm. As to Lady Macbeth
having that tremendous chance with the sleep-walking
near the end—that is simply preposterous. That, together
with a few other bits of hers here and there, I have
absorbed as a matter of course, and it comes in capitally,
the Messenger suddenly running in against Macbeth, who
is going off with the celebrated—
"To bod, to bed, to bed!"
and waking him with a start, which gives excellent
meaning to his otherwise inexplicable line,
"The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!"
But commentators would naturally ask, "Howabout
the Ghost P" For that question he had a prompt reply.
There was no Ghost to cut out. It was quite clear, as
he had pointed out in another place, that Shakspeare
didn't like these supernatural tomfooleries, and that the
Ghost in Hamlet was evidently tacked on to the Play
by some Manager who had got the armour and the
lime-light in the theatre, and would bring them in some-
how—probably at Christmas-time. He always played
Hamlet without the Ghost, and threw in all the lines
of the latter into his advioe to the Players, and they
went capitally. The whole Scene was always a roar.
But to revert to the Ghost of Banquo. Could it be
doubted for a moment that this was a practical joke of
Macbeth's—one of his best—specially prepared to amuse
his guests at the banquet P He had always taken this
view of it, and at the recent representation of Macbeth
at Covent Garden, he had done his best to give this idea
its fullest expression. There he hoped he had made it
quite clear that Banquo was no spirit, but a friend of
the family who was in the fun," and as fond of a joke
as Macbeth himself. Till the appointed time he hides
under the dinner-table. Surely the audience saw that f
Then, when he does eome through a trap, note the
manner. A good ten-foot spring into the air brings him
down into.a sitting position on the stage, while a flap-
trick on an adjacent column discloses the familiar legend,
A RISE IN SPIRITS.
This did not act quite as perfectly as he could have
wished at Covent Garden, the other evening, but still he
trusted the intention was, in the main, obvious enough.

"With regard to the^ other points, he was obliged to be brief; but
he hoped that, by his taking: a call in the Murder Scene, when covered
with gore, he could be not only " bloody and bold," but "resolute"
not to let the fun flag, through missing a ehanoe of scoring with that
master-secret of all humour, a fine sense of the incongruous.
But he was obliged to close his remarks, and he felt that he could
not do so more appropriately than by saying that he trusted that,

VERY TRYING.
A Record of a few Trials of Patience.
No. VIII.—Decrease of Crme.
On the Lokd Mayor taking his seat at the Mansion'House, Mr.
Nowal, the Chief Clerk, addressing his Lordship said: It is with
much pleasure, my Lord, that I
have to inform your Lordship
that there is not a single night-
charge this morning for hearing.
There are no remanded cases, and
not one summons. According to
the ancient custom, my Lord, it
devolves upon me to present your
Lordship with a pair of white kid
gloves.
The Lobd Matok, addressing
Mr. Nowal, said: The announce-
ment of this fact is far more
satisfactory to me than my
powers of expression will admit.
Nothing can be bo agreeable to
one who has to administer justice
than the news of decrease in
crime. It would be a matter of
great interest to me, if you, Mr.
Nowax, will kindly look over
last year's books, and let me
know how many charges were brought before my predecessor on this
very day last year. We oan then make a good comparison, and note
to what extent crime has decreased.
Mr. Nowal, the Chief Clerk, then left the Court for the purpose.
Mr. Joelaed (from Whitehall), courteously addressing his Lord-
ship, said: May I be permitted, your Lordship
The Lord Mayor. Are you about to make some observations
respecting Mr. Nowal's observations P
Mr. Joelard [politely). No, your Lordship; I was about
The Lord Mayor. Then I cannot hear you just now. I am expect-
ing Mr. Nowal's return every moment.
Mr. Joelard (with gentle persistence). But it's most urgent
The Lord Mayor. Now, tto pray not to interrupt. I will hear you
presently.
Mr._ Nowal, the Chief Clerk, returned into Court, and said: I have
examined the books, your Lordship, and find that this exact day last
year fell on a Sunday, on which day, of course, as your Lordship
is aware, the Court does not sit.
The Lord Mayor. Let me see. It would scarcely be fair to judge by
any other day. I think, Mr. Nowal, the better plan would be to
examine the books on this day (the seventeenth) two years ago.
Mr. Nowal said: He thought his Lordship's suggestion was most
exoellent, and left the Court for the necessary examination of the
books.
Mr. Joelard (amiably). My Lord, as the Chief Clerk may be some
Mr. Joelard.
The Lord Mayor. Really, Sir, you have admitted that your appli
cation is not concerning the present matter, and I cannot hear you
until it is disposed of. These statistics respecting the decrease of
crime are of immense publio importance. I will hear yon, as I
before remarked, by-and-by.
Mr. Nowal returned into Court, and, addressing the Lobs Matob,
said: A careful examination of the books has been made, my Lord,
with a result that I am certain will be exceedingly satisfactory to
your Lordship. On this corresponding day two years ago, there were
not only two night charges (one of drunkenness, and one of begging),
but there was also an important remand; a charge, preferred by a
mistress against her servant, of stealing a postage-stamp.
The Lord Mayor. This is very gratifying. An immense deorease
of crime has been clearly shown, and what is so flattering to me, is
to think that such an event should have occurred during my year
of Lord Mayoralty. I take this opportunity of thanking you, Mr.
Nowal, for your valuable assistance, and the Bar, the Reporters,
and the Police, for their courtesy.
Mr. Nowax, the Chief Clerk, acknowledged the compliment paid
to him by the Lobd Matob in a few well-chosen wordsj and then
handed his Lordship a pair of white kid gloves, according to the
usual custom.
Mr. Joelard. May I now, my Lord
The Lord Mayor (with considerable severity). Pray do not inter-
rupt me, Sir. I was about to observe, Mr. Nowal, when I was, as
you no doubt noticed, rudely interrupted, that 1 should like to
make a suggestion, in case a similar occasion to this should occur, and
I heartily hope it will, for the Public's sake. The suggestion is,
that lavender kid gloves should be presented instead of white. I
know this is a departure from ancient custom, but one ought to go
with the times, and, as you are doubtless aware, white kid gloves
are a little out of fashion now.
Mr. Nowal thanked his Lordship for the suggestion, and the
proceedings terminated.
Mr. Joelard. May I now be permitted to address your Lordship?
The Lord Mayor (having received a hint from Mr. Nowal, who
had just recognised Mr. Jobiabd). Most certainly. I beg your
pardon, I am sure. (Much bowing.) I have not had the pleasure of
seeing you here before.
Mr. Joelard (returning salutes courteously). I am exceedingly
sorry to have interrupted your Lordship, but my application is
indeed very urgent. Has your Lordship fixed any time for the
hearing of the Dynamite Case to-day P
The Lord Mayor. Dynamite Case? To-day? There must be
some mistake. There is neither charge nor remand to-day—not even
a summons.
Mr. Joelard. I am afraid not. Eight men have been arrested
within the last quarter-of-an-hour at the " Eagle and Dove " publio-
house over the road. They are at the Station now—the oharge is
being entered against them at this moment. They will be brought
over at once almost.
The Lord Mayor. But you said Dynamite Case.
Mr. Joelard. Yes, Sir. Four cans, with fuses attached, were found
in their possession, corresponding precisely with the oan found on
Finnigen.
The Lord Mayor. Fiswigen. Who is Finotgeit?
Mr. Joelard. He is charged with an attempt to blow up your
Lordship.
The Lord Mayor. What?
Mr. Joelard. He was found, my Lord, twenty minutes ago, in the
room situated immediately below your Lordship's seat, with a oan
and a fuse attaohed [ 1 he Court suddenly adjourned.

SPORTING NOTES.
(From a Pleasant Point of View.)
THE TURF.
Lists of betting on the Spring Handicaps are now to be read in the
papers, but those of my readers who are not positive candidates for
the suffrages of the governing body of the
Earlswood Asylum for Idiots must know
that these lists are in the main fictitious
swindles. Looking over the Tyler's Hill
Handicap, for instance, I see that Qillie,
3 yrs., 6st. 7lb. is favourite. Why? The
money reported to be invested on him
cannot be that of the public, for the public
has never seen Gillie on a race-course, and
inordinate ass as the public undeniably is,
it is not quite yet so demented as to back
an animal of which nothing is known.
The money reported to be invested is not
that of the owner, for it is the most patent
fact in the Turf world that Colonel De
Prosfero is so notoriously hard up, and
has behaved so badly whenever he has had
a chance, that not one single bookmaker
will trust him for anything beyond half-a-crown ready money, and
if he were a wise bookmaker he would test the genuineness of that
before booking the bet. The stable connections are as equally
beggarly thieves as the Colonel, and nobody would ever accuse the
trainer" of backing a horse under his oharge. He has made what
money he has by laying against those horses he has trained, more
especially if they have been favourites.
1 pass over Highflyer, The Masher, Kingsgate, Dumpton, and
PegweU Bay, as I am now discussing racehorses and their merits,
and not the possibility of there being a glut of glue in the market
before the season is over. Hoola-Hoola is being well backed, and it
is said by the owner; but, of course, those who know the owner the
best will, like myself, believe what he says the least. 6st. 91b. is a
very light weight for a 5-year-old, and in favour of this horse it
must be said that each time he ran last year he was roped in suoh a
shameless and open manner, that but for the fact that the punish-
ment would have had to include some prominent members of the
Jockey Club, both Hoola-Hoola's trainer, owner, and jookey would
have been warned off the Turf for life. The OxiU, 5 yrs. (7st.) is the
property of a sportsman who—as far as is known—is a perfectly
straightforward nobleman, and he has engaged Ascot Heath to ride,
a fact which weighs much with the public. Undeniably, A. Heath
is a consummate horseman, but he has acquired £30,000 within the
last ten years, a fact which indubitably proves that his powers of
thieving are equal to his riding. If winning will suit Heath, from
a pecuniary point of view, better than losing, why The OuU is
certain to be first past the post; but as I have every reason to know
that he has already been squared by a very wealthy bookmaker—
Nimhod Jehu to wit—who knows too much about Heath's former
robberies to be left in the lurch by him, I shall throw over The
OuU, and plump for
Sooth Forelaicd
who is very well treated indeed. I know that he belongs to a confede-
racy who would break into a church if they could, but I also know
that so unfortunate were they last year, that unless they win a race
very soon, and South Foreland is quite good enough a horse to do it,
there is no alternative for them but the gaol or the workhouse.
By the death of Mr. Newe Kut, the Ring has lost one of its most
prominent members. He was a man who played the great game. He
was tolerably honest in his business, and in private life was much
beloved by his wife, who died in a Temperance Retreat some years
ago, and by his son, who, however, went utterly wrong, and is at
present either at Chatham or Dartmoor. The deceased's liberal gifts
of coals and meat and beer and blankets to the poor of his native
town will be bitterly missed by them next Christmas. Mr. Newe
Kut's first start on the Turf was as a Welsher—he was severely
hurt at Hampton thirty years ago—having originally been a Waiter
in a City Chop-house.
BOATING.
The Oxbridge crew has been doing its usual work this week, and
precious hard work it has been. An eight from a girl's school would
beat our lot this year with such men as No. 4 and No. 7 rowing. This
fact is transparent to all, but it is equally well known that No. 4 is
the President's cousin, and that No. 7 intends to give up rowing after
this race, and devote himself to playing, for very high stakes, of
whioh he has plenty, loo, tcarti, and other games of chance or skill
of which he knows absolutely nothing. If our lot win, the others had
better make a bonfire of their boat and oars.
The Camford eight has been getting through steady work this
week, and as steadily going from bad to worse, and at tneir present
rate of progression bid fair by the day of the race to be able to make
no headway at all unless assisted by a powerful steam-tug. No. 2,
although ostensibly conforming to training regulations, has taken to
secret drinking, whioh accounts for his inability to give any practical
help to the boat. No. 5, who was a good man once, now, so his_ skip
informs me. hangs a curtain over his fire-place, and smokes six or
seven pipes of strong tobacco up his chimney every night. If our
crew, win, the grateful onlookers might afford a speedy and public
funeral to our opponents.
The sculling match between Jobber and young Flasket, to come
off next Tuesday, still engrosses attention in the low gubliehouses of
Hammersmith, and among the riparian thieves who interest them-
selves in aquatics. Both men are fit, but what is more to the
purpose is that young Flasket's baokers have offered £90 to Jobber
to lose. Jobber, however, holds out for £100. If he gets it» he will
of course be well beaten; but, if his terms are not acoeded to, it is
100 to I on him, as he is as much in front of young Flashet as a
fire-engine is faster than a four-wheeled cab.
PIGEON-SHOOTING.
The match for £100 a-side at twenty-five pigeons, at twenty-seven
yards rise, between Mr. "Bopper" and Mr. "Dopper," is fairly
puzzling backers, and I confess that I cannot put my finger on the
winner. Both stand as nearly on the same mark as possible, and
Mr. "Boppeh" is training on " poker," icarti, the Theatres, and
continual suppers at well-known restaurants in the Strand and
Regent Street. This, in great measure, puts him out of court, and,
indeed, when I last saw him, he was as chippy as a man could wish
to be. Mr. "Dopper" is as fit as a two-year old, but. on the other
hand, can't get his money on at his own price, and his powers of
missing "owls." when the market doesn't suit him, are only too
well known to his infatuated backers. With neither man up to the
present "on the job," it is impossible for me to select a winner.
COURSING.
A vert curious contretemps brought the Zed meeting to a close on
Tuesday week. Mr. Armstrong's 'Appy-go-Luchy and Mr. D. E.
Sever's Destiny were left in the final tie for the Zed Cup, and bet-
ting ruled at guineas to pounds on Destiny. When slipped, it was
at once seen that something was wrong, and the running of two such
well-known dogs was derisively cheered by the crowds assembled.
After an undeoided, they were returned to the slips, but before
sighting Puss, 'Appy-go-Lucky fell down dead, and the Cup and
stakes were awarded to Destiny. After a wrangle, an investigation
was instituted, and it transpired that both owners had, previous to
the final, indulged their own dogs in huge meals. By winning
the Zed Cup, Mr. D. E. Sever is reported ruined; and his not
settling conclusively proves what a heavy commission he had executed
in favour of his opponent's dog.

For the M audi feet of hare,

A MYSTERIOUS CALLING.
We read in the Era—
WANTED, a Good HAND-
SELLER; also a Watch-
maker; if can handsell preferred.
—Apply, stating salary required.
Now, what is a "Hand-
seller"? According to dic-
tionaries and general accepta-
tion, to handsel is to use
anything for the first time."
Now, we imagine the salary
required would depend very
much upon what was to be
handselled. Supposing you
were desired to handsel a fifty-
pound note, your friend's best
silk umbrella, some 'Thirty-
four Port, or a box of su-
perb Intimidads, it might be
very pleasant. But it would
be a very different matter if
you were requested to handsel
an unbroken horse, a pair of
tight boots, or a new meer-
schaum pipe. Of course, all
these things should be con-
sidered in the remuneration.
FATHER THAMES IN DANGER.
It is certainly high time some responsible body looked after the
welfare of Father Thames. If the Thames Conservancy have not
the ability or the power to do it, by all means let it be placed in the
hands of those who have not only skill but discretion. The rights of
riparian owners should be rigidly inquired into. Frequently their
only rights arise from putting up a threatening notice-board, marking
land that has been filched from the River, Private," and placing
bars and chains across backwaters.
Those who know the Thames well could point to many secluded
spots, belonging as much to the Public as any bye-way turning out
or Bond Street, which have been unceremoniously converted into
Erivate property. An instance has even been known of a man who,
_ y planting withys in the Thames, eventually established a little
island, which he claimed as his private property.
Mr. Punch is glad to find the House of Commons is about to give
some attention to this subject. He hopes the matter of ferries,
towpaths, backwaters, and landing-places will be fully discussed,
and at the same time he trusts something will be done to control the
vagaries of the "river roughs," who land in private gardens, who
bathe at mid-day in front of respectable dwelling-places, who come
in crowds in steam-launches, and make the quiet reaches of the
Upper Thames hideous with their drunkenness, their vulgar music-
hall songs, and their blasphemy. There is plenty of work for real,
capable, energetic Conservators of the Thames to do; and if they
cannot or will not do it, Mr. Punch will have to find someone who can.
Intellectual Surfeit.—Consequence of Cram': Cramhe repetita.
THE METEING OF THE WATERS.
There is not, in the Session, a joke so complete
As the sight when the Tories and Tnrtlemen meet
In conflict direct about Water-Supply,
And when Randt to Fowler gives one in the eye."
That double-ohinn'd joker, great Harcourt, must shake
As Coofe the Conservative benches doth rake
With his verbal stern-chasers; acidulous Firth
Must be moved to a Mephistophelian mirth.
Oh, it must be some sly compensation, if slight,
For delay of their Measure, to witness the fight
'Twiit the old Corporation, their long-threatened foe,
And those bad Water Companies, equally so.
The Municipal Bill may be under a cloud,
But to hear cheeky Churchill demanding aloud
What's the use of an Alderman, verily, this
Must mitigate bile by one moment of bliss.
The meteing of waters may be a small point,
When they hold the whole City is quite out of Joint;
But this pleasant reflection must comfort their breast,
"When rogues tumble out,"—well, the world knows the rest!
New Name for It.—The Merchant Shipping Bill to be known
as "Chamberlain's New Apparatus for Saving Life at Sea."
Admirable invention! We're afraid it's just a bit overweighted,
but " Partner Joe" can soon set that right.

SSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
BXTEACTKD FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, March 10.—More of " want
to know,'you know," about Government polioy in Egypt. "Politics in
the House of Commons moulded on fashion of one of those stupid
musio-hall songs which always end with catchpenny refrain," says
Jons Morlet. "An infinite succession of verses more or less heavy
and always the line, ' What's your policy in Egypt f'"
Georgie Hamilton took a turn to-night. Tried to be vivacious.
Couldn't be done. Essayed to be venomous. Too late ; been done
score of times before. Great success of evening Grand Cross, that
ponderously wise, profoundly intelligent, supremely lucid personage.
"Don't know anybody," says Randolph, "who looks so wise as
Cross, and is so foolish.''
Sir Richard more than ever himself to-night, spectacled, spas-
modic, severe, superfluous, his modicum of meaning feebly struggling
through wilderness of words.
"You will.not," he said, angrily tapping the table, and surveying
through his spectacles the shrinking form of Hartington on other
side,—" You will not allow one single Minister to say a word, or to
have any power in the Cabinet, unless you allow him to do so, and
then you say that that is what you will not do."
Seriously, this is not a joke. Took down the words as they were
uttered and simply make transcript. Only sample of scores of sen-
tences which, addressing House towards midnight, Grand Cross drops
on astonished floor. Delivered with angry earnestness, enforced by
forefinger shaken at Treasury Bench, they sound singularly impres-
sive. Warton loudly cheers. "Yah, Yah, Yah 1 "cries the Lord
Mayor, and looks round at Liberals as who should say, "There now.
what do you think of that! There's force, clearness, and judgment!
Let' b see some of your fellows beat that." Still when we get the
words written out on paper meaning seems a little hazy.
Forstkr to the front again, more candid than usual, honester than
ever.
"We 're wrong I know." says Harcocrt, humbly. "Curious thing
is that we have never been right since Forstkr left us. Used to
agree. Up to difficulty with Ireland, Forstkr one of us; shared our
counsels, defended our acts when attacked. Then comes the day he
leaves us, and never since have we in one single instance been right.
Odd, but too true."
Busmen done.—Debate on Polioy in Egypt collapsed. Votes for
military expenditure agreed to.
Tuesday.—Tennyson, having been called early this morning, got
down to House at four o'clock. Never saw a man more dejected.
"Are they going to hang your Lordship ?" I asked, as he placed a
hot and nerveless hand on my paw.
"No," he said, wearily, they're only going to swear me in.
Done my best to get out of it. Tell you a secret, if you won't
mention it. You know story about theft of my robes? All nonsense.
Fact is, reading the Ingoldeby Legends the night after clothes came
home from tailor's. Happy thought occurred to me. Got up, went
into the garden, dug hole, and buried clothes. You '11 find them,
Tobt, when I am gone, under the oak-tree on the right-hand side,

Tried to cheer him up. Offered him cigar. Pressed glass of
sherry wine upon him. Proposed to read Maud. Nothing would do.
"They 're coming for me, he said, with a slight shudder. "I
hear their footsteps in the hall."
In the House, scene affected me to tears. Contrast the greater
between Poet-Laureate's pale pained face, drooping figure, and slow
gait, with Duke of Argyll's oock-a-whoop stride. Good deal of
hobnobbing goes on on these occasions. Poor Tennyson taken first
to one Bench, then to another, finally to Lord Chancellor, who
shakes his hand, and whispers to him to cheer up.
"May I go now?" was all Tennyson answered, with difficulty
restraining the flood of tears the like of which had not shamed his
manhood for half a century.
"Yes, take him away," said Selborne, himself not unaffected.
So he slipped out into the robing-room, and Argyll helped him to
strip himself of his borrowed plumes.
"Cheer up, old Chappie," said The McCcixttm More.
ate you, or wants to."
Tennyson turned on him glance of withering scorn.
"' Vex not thou the Poet's mind
With thy shallow wit;
Vex not thou the Poet's mind,
For thou canst not fathom it.'"
With these words he strode forth, and, calling a fourwheeler, made
off to the railway-station.
Business done.—In Commons, threw out Metropolitan Water Bill,
passed Parks Bill, appointed Seleot Committee to inquire into ques-
tion of Preservation of Thames, and went home at eight o'clock,
having done more business than on any single night in preceding
portion of Session.

On most charming: subjects, too—Copyhold Enfranchisement, Regis-
tration, Old Cemeteries, and Commons and Enclosure Acts. Elton
a big man; might perhaps claim to make two maiden speeches, or at
least one-and-a-half, against average Member. But four, excessive;
and still not satisfied.
"Dear me!" he said, when at quarter to six the usual "Wednesday

Thursday.—Never thought Ramsay could get so much expression
into his face. Mingled surprise and inquiry, not untouched by horror
and shame. House laughed whilst he was speaking. Was it pos-
sible? Had he unawares made a joke P An honest man, Ramsay.
Wouldn't do anything wrong for the world; yet how powerless is
good intent against accident I
I don't see anything in this for amusement," he said, pausing
and looking round with scared face, whereat the House laughed
again, and Kamsay gave it up.
"Can't do with frivolity, Toby," he said to me, afterwards, "and
this Comytee rather given to it. Have sat here for ten years. Often
heard men about me cackling and sometimes roaring with laughter.
Like to know things. Have earnestly inquired what they were
laughing at. Never could see it. 1'm a plain business man and like
serious conversation in prent or speech. Always read your Diary.
No frivolling there. Nothing but good plain facts, some of them new
and ourious. In the House like to hear Talbot speak, and Sclater-
Booth and Donsox. Good strong meat. No kickshaws like that
young popinjay Lord Randolph serves up. Wonder the House tole-
rates rum. Glad you don't think I was funny just now. Gave me
awful shock when I heard House laughing."
Tm Healy pretty lively to-night. Aocuses Trevelyan of being
the nephew of Lord Macaulay and trying to hang innocent men.
Joseph Gillis applausive. Healy getting a little blown after the
eleventh speech. Windbag Sexton gallantly comes to his assistance.
Harangues for about an nour, whilst he accuses the Irish Govern-
ment of "a policy of lying," and "by stealthy, tricky, cruel, and
cowardly means throwing into gaol harmless men"—like Joe Beady
and his colleagues. All this it appears is in order. At least Chair-
man interferes only once, when Tim persisted in describing Tre-
velyan as concerned in conspiracy to murder. At Two o'clock in
the morning Childf.bs reminds Committee that there is business to
do, so set to work and sat all night. Business done.—Votes in Supply.
Friday.—Though Ramsay doesn't joke, our new Speaker does
sometimes, in quiet way. Just now Onslow up, with serious com-
plaint. Seems ne's been making vicious attack on Baxter in secret
as he thought. Got in the papers. Onslow ponderously indignant.
** Drat them papers!" says he. "Why can't people be content
with their 'Tizer t Never read anything else myself.
"The Member for Onslow," the Speaker called him. taking rapid
account of fact that he doesn't represent anybody else. And a
very stupid constituency, too," said Sir Wilfrid.
Business done. — House determines to talk to-night, and work
to-morrow. So Saturday Sitting arranged for.

For such a paltry sum how can they possibly afford to teach

This plan of teaching Greek to Infants under eight years of age,
through the assistance of the Regius Professor at Oxford is really an
admirable innovation.
Now that we have cut down our Army Estimates so as to allow for
one regiment of the Line and half a battery of old Artillery, and
have decided not to refit our three worn-out iron-clads, perhaps the
Education Rate will not be felt quite so heavily.
My dear, be sure and remember to tell Eliza to give us only boiled

Coptio Lexicons stiU to be paid for.
The notion of erecting a small Lunatic Asylum in connection with
each Board School, for the accommodation of children unable to
stand the strain of the enlarged curriculum, indicates muoh foresight
on the part of the Board.
It is painful to have to tell Sammy—who is such a olever boy, and

THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AS IT SHOULD BE.
(A Report taken after the passing of Mr. Punch's proposed Rules.)
In the House of Commons, the Speaker having taken the Chair at
four o'clock, a message from the Upjper House was read to the effect
that their Lordships had just carried a Resolution agreeing pro-
spectively to everything settled by the Commons, and declaring all
Bills that would naturally have come before their Lordships from
another place as read three times and passed.
The First Lord of the Treasury was about to congratulate the
House on this very sensible arrangement, which he said was calcu-
lated to Bave much valuable publio time, when
The Speaker interposed; and, while deprecating an undue inter-
ference with the right of debate, suggested that the Eight Hon.
Gentleman might moro conveniently write what he wished to say to
one of the daily papers. (.Cheers.)
Leader of the Opposition, while bowing to the authority of
toi. inxn.
the Chair, thought it would be only respectful if some acknowledg-
ment
The Speaker (interrupting): I know what the Right Hm. Gentle-
man is about to say. But no acknowledgment is possible. Their
Lordships, after passing the Resolution just conveyed to the House,
immediately adjourned until this day year. {Laughter.)
An Hon. Member wished to ask—but
The Speaker moved that he was out of order, as by the New Rules
no questions were permitted. (" Hear, hear ! ")
The Queen's Speech (which had been communicated to the Publio
Press a week before the assembling of Parliament) was then taken
as read.
The First Lord of the Treasury reminded the House that Rule VII.
declared that when the Government had a two-thirds Majority,
all measures should be accepted without opposition. (" Hear,
hear.'") He begged to introduoe the Estimates, which had for some
weeks been under the consideration of the people in the pages of the
Public Press; and as Hon. Members had already received copies of
the accounts, he proposed that they be accepted en bloc.
The Estimates cn bloc were then agreed to.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer then introduced the Budget.
He would make no financial statement, as his plan had been fully
explained, before the assembling of the House, in the daily journals.
The Budget was passed under Rule VII.
The following Bills were then read three times, and passed under
the same regulation:—The New Borough and County Franchise Bill,
the New Bankruptcy Bill, the New Merchant Shipping Bill, the New
Corrupt Praotices (Elections) Bill, the New England, Ireland, and
Scotland Distribution of Seats Bill, and the Corporation of London
(Abolition of) Bill.
Just as the last-mentioned measure was being read a Third Time,
the Lord Mayor of London rose from his seat, and amidst loud
shouts of " Order!" tried to address the House.
The Speaker: I must request the Right Hon. Gentleman to resume
his seat. His interruption is indecent. (Loud cheers.) I must
remind the House that Rule VIII. abolishes all discussion not sanc-
tioned by the Chair. I have made it a practice to permit no dis-
cussion when no interest can be advanced bv talking (" Hear, hear.'")
All the oratory in the world would not influence a single Party vote;
so it would be a pure waste of time to discuss these matters further.
(" Hear, hear .'") If the Right Hon. Member wishes to speak, surely
he can avail himself of the privilege when presiding over the splendid
hospitality of the Mansion House. (Cheers and laughter.)
The Corporation of London (Abolition of) Bill was then passed, as
were the Criminal Code Bill, the Compulsory Cheap Consumable
Articles Bill, the Foreign Cattle Importation Bill, the New Marriage
Bill, the Married Woman's Property Protection Bill, the Gas and
Water Companies Abolition Bill, the Payment of Vestrymen Bill,
the Primogeniture Abolition Bill, the Real and Personal Property
Amalgamation Bill, and the Fox-hunting Suppression Bill.
When this measure was reached, the Lord Mayor of London again
interposed. He wished to say that, in the interests of Epping
Forest
The Speaker having called the Lord Mayor to order, all the
Private Bills of the Session (which had been examined in Committee
during the Recess) were read three times, and passed. Thirty
Clerks, each reading a Bill simultaneously, got through this duty in
a few minutes.
The First Lord of the Treasury then announced that the work of
the Session was over. Her Majesty (by a recent statute) was now
permitted to give the Royal Assent through the medium of the Post-
master-General, who stamped the various measures on their arrival
at St. Martin's-le-Grand. This formality would be observed before
to-morrow morning. (Cheers.) Their labours were now at an end.
(Prolonged applause.)
The Leader of the Opposition then asked how they would learn
the contents of the Queen's Speech proroguing Parliament.
The Speaker: By reading it in the evening papers. (Renewed
cheering.)
The Members then separated, after expressing themselves delighted
with the afternoon's entertainment, and conscious of the fact that
they had done more real work in less than a couple of hours under
the New Rules than, in the olden time, used to be accomplished
during the greater part of a twelvemonth.

ABSENT FRIENDS; OR, HOW I DEFENDED
BURNABY!
L-rd R-nd-lph Ch-rch-U (gallantly). "You SHALL only reach
BIU THROUGH US!''
VERY TRYING.
A Record of a few Trials of Patience.
No. IX.—Cross-Examination.
Jonathan Bullethead, a powerfully-built man, with ooarse
features, was charged before Mr. Oldtown with assaulting his wife,
by kicking her, in Regent Street.
Mr. Moses Jones appeared for the Prisoner, and, addressing Mr.
Oldtown, said: Please, your Worship, I am instructed on behalf of
the Prisoner, who is a most respectable man, to say that his wife
does not appear against him to prosecute, for reasons which, I dare
say, she knows best. I am instructed by the Prisoner that he not
only never laid a hand on her, but he desires a full investigation of
the case.
Mr. Oldtown. He is not charged with laying his hand upon her.
The assanlt was alleged to have been committed with the feet.
Mr. Moses Jones. My positive instructions
Mr. Oldtown. Is the Constable here who took the Prisoner in
charge P
The Constable stepped forward, and said that the Complainant,
who was much hurt, was afraid to appear against her husband.
Mr. Oldtown. I thought as much. I shall remand the Prisoner
until
Mr. Moses Jones. I beg your pardon, your Worship
Mr. Oldtown. So you ought, for interrupting me.
An elderly Clergyman here stepped forward, and, addressing Mr.
Oldtown, said: Your Worship, I happened to be an unexpected
witness of this most cowardly assault, and, purely in the interest of
the Public, have come here, at great inconvenience, to give evidence.
Mr. Moses Jones. Really, your Worship, this is most irregular.
The Complainant does not wish to come forward. Are we then to
accept evidence from an outsider, in clerical garb, who is virtuous
about public interest, who is—in fact, who is he P I have known
cases—I don't say this is an instanoe—but I have known innocent
men convicted on the testimony of a stranger, bribed by somo person
having a grudge against the accused. I repeat, I don't insinuate it
is the case now, but how am I to know who this Gentleman is.
Mr. Oldtown. You seem very anxious to know who he is. The
opportunity shall be afforded you. I shall aocept his evidence.
Mr. Moses Jones. Surely, Sir
Mr. Oldtown. Yes. Most surely.
The Rev. John Jimps then stated: That he saw the Prisoner
make a rush at a little woman in Regent Street, knock her down, and
kick her several times.
Mr. Oldtown. If other members of the general Public would
follow your example, Mr. Jimps, greater facility would be afforded
the Justioes of Peace to get rid of such ruffians as this. You have
set a good example, and I hope others may be induced to follow it.
Mr. Moses Jones. I may be permitted, I presume, your Worship,
to cross-examine this Witness.
Mr. Oldtown. Oh, certainly.
Mr. Moses Jones. Now, then! What are you?
Witness {the Rev. Mr. Jimps). A Clergyman.
Mr. Moses Jones. What income do you make?
Mr. Oldtown. What has this to do with the case?
Mr. Moses Jones. I am acting on my instructions, Sir; I have a
right to ask any questions that teBt the credibility of the Witness. 1
act in accordance with my right, and mean to do so. (To Witness.)
What is your income?
Witness. From my church about £200 a-ycar, and from private
sources about £50 a-year.
Mr. Moses Jones. Private sources. Oh, I thought we should
arrive at something. You see, your Worship, how important this is.
(To Witness.) What are those private sources you speak of P
Witness. I really do not see what this has to do with the case P
Mr. Moses Jones (fiercely). Answer the question.
Mr. Oldtown (the Magistrate). I am afraid you must answer the
question.
Witness. I have a small income left me by an Aunt.
Mr. Moses Jones. Oh, indeed! Now, on your oath, Sir—Will you
swear she was your Aunt t
Witness (indignantly). I appeal to your Worship for protection.
Mr. Moses Jones. Answer tne question.
Witness. I swear it.
Mr. Moses Jones. Have you ever reoeived money before for being
an independent Witness?
Witness. Never!
Mr. Moses Jones. Don't lose your temper. Have you ever appeared
before in the so-called interests of the Publio?
Witness. No; and never mean to again, if I can help it.
Mr. 3Ioses Jones. Have you ever received money for selling old
clothes?
Witness. What do you insinuate?
Mr. Moses Jones. Don't ask me questions, but answer mine.
Witness. I once sold some old left-off things of my own, but I
don't see any necessity to rake up private transactions
Mr. Moses Jones. That '11 do. What did you get for them?
Mr. Oldtown (the Magistrate). I shall take upon myself to stop
this examination. Supposing the Witness received eighteenpence,
or even five pounds for the things, what on earth has it to do with
the present case P If I myself chose to sell a pair of left-off trousers,
is that to debar me from delivering judgments in future?
Mr. Moses Jones. I shall perhaps De able to show that this Witness
is a very shady person.
Mr. Oldtown. On his testimony, I shall remand the Prisoner with-
out bail, and if the wife does not appear on the next oocasion, I may
convict him on the same testimony.
Mr. Moses Jones. Should the Prisoner be discharged, I might take
measures to have the Witness suspended.
Mr. Oldtown. And if the Prisoner is convicted, the Witness might
take measures to have you struck off the Rolls.
Mr. Moses Jones. After that expression of opinion from your
Worship, I beg to apologise to the Witness.
The Witness kindly aocepted the apology, and the proceedings
terminated.
Not far Wrong.
"What? Bother me with their Committee?"
Cries Watkin, "I the truth divine:
They think—the fools,—and more's the pity,
I don't know where to draw the line!
Otters in the Thames.—Our Special Otterman, whom we dis-
patched to make inquiries on the subject, thus telegraphs:—" The
Otter is no longer the Ottercrat of the Thames, though you may
occasionally see in secluded parts, on bitten branches, his dental
Ottergraph, which shows he has not altogether ceased to exist." We
have wired to our Representative to return instantly.

THE FOWLER DID SPREAD HIS NET IN VAIN!
Oub City Correspondent informs us that having fortunately dis-
covered the name and address of the Lord Mayor's Butterman, who
contracts, at per ton, for the weekly contents of his Lordship's
Waste-Paper Basket, he has been enabled to obtain the replies of
the various celebrities to a recent Munching House invitation, copies
of which he subjoins:—
Lord Randolph Churchill (who had been asked to " talk down"
Mr. Gladstone) would have been much pleased to have accepted
the Lord Mayor's courteous invitation under other circumstances,
and in other company; but with Railway Stations flying about our
heads, and cattle dying by the hundred thousand, and the national
expenditure increasing by millions and millions a day, he must
decline accepting hospitality in company with the man who has
caused it all 1
Mr. Marriott, M.P. (begged to escort Mr. Chamberlain), regrets
exceedingly that he is unable to accept the Lord Mayor's Kind
invitation, associated, as he would be, with one who, to the meanness
of a screw adds the sting of a wasp and the audacity of a Caucusian.
Mr. Bradlaugh, M.P. (asked to give his arm to Mr. Newdegate),
presents his compliments to the Lord Mayor, and very much regrets
that a previous engagement to lecture at the Hall of Science, Huggin
Lane, prevents him from accepting his most unexpected invitation to
dinner on April 1st; the more so, as he should nave been glad of
the opportunity of convincing Mr. Newdegate of his error in sup-
posing that he was not perfectly ready to swallow any oath without
blinking.
Mr. Parnell (required to convoy Mr. Forster), having oonsulted
the Members of that important Party of which he is the only acknow-
ledged leader, has received their instructions to decline, without
thanks, the invitation to dine at the Mansion House, in close
proximity to the cold-blooded Saxon who ruled his down-trodden
country with a rod of hot lead and cold steel, and left a name behind
him which they will Forster till that glorious time when a Native
Parliament of calm, dignified, peace-loving representatives shall meet
on the shores of the beautiful Liffey.
Mr. Bass (paired with Sir Wilfrid Lawson), would have accepted
the Lord Mayor's invitation with very much pleasure if unaccom-
panied with the intimation of the name of his next neighbour on
the occasion. But to be seated next to a chaffing Teetotaller who
would be watching every draught he took, would make his Bitter
Ale bitter indeed, and make him as Mumm over his Champagne as
a Waiter.
Mr. Joseph Gillis Biggar, M.P. (allotted to Sir William
Vernon Harcourt], is somewhat surprised that the Lord Mayor
should think it possible that he could lor one moment consent to put
his Irish legs under the same mahogany as that bitter foe to the
patriotic Irish Brigade, the Home Secretary, otherwise it would
have pleased his genial nature to have seen the conger eel that his
poor countrymen spurn with contempt, served up as a luxury to the
ignorant Saxon.
Mr. James Firth Bottohley Firth, M.P. (attached to Sir Walter
Robert Carden), must decline the Lord Mayor's invitation for the
1st of April, having an important Post Office engagement for that
day, which will pay better. Even were it not so, he should still think
that " better is an humble chop and a baked tater in the Hall of the
Middle Temple, than doubtful turtle and high wenson at that'Shrine
of Gluttony,' the Munchin' House!"

LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business.
To Mr. David James, on "Confusion" at the Vaudeville, and on a
Report about " The Rivals " at the Haymarkct.
Mt deab David,
I don't remember ever having1 written to you before this;
and when I wrote down your Christian name,—not that " David " is
a distinctively Christian name, beinsr common alike to the Ancient
Hebrew Raoe and Welshmen (whose Christianity was for a considerable
time doubtful, and has never entirely got rid of a certain Druidical
flavour that still hangs about it)—a thrill went right through me,
and had 1 been a Spiritualist, I should have felt convinced that the
Shade of Garrick was at my elbow, looking over my shoulder, and
inquiring, in a chilly whisper, "May I ask if you are addressing me f"
Yes, my dear David James, you are the only member of the Theatri-
cal Profession who, as far as I am aware, bears the honoured name
of David; and that you have also something of the Garrick stuff in
you I will honestly take my Davy, and aver that from what we have
read of Garrick, you are at least half-a-Davy, as Robson was quite
three-quarters of him.
80 you are not going to revive Our Boys at the Criterion, and
Charles Windham is going to reappear there himself with a new
Comedy. Good luck to it! The other evening I dropped into the
Vaudeville (whioh you dropped out of some time ago), but I didn't
see your old ohum and partner Thomas in Confusion, which is a
funny farce spun out into three Acts, all about a baby and a dog, just
as Nita's First at the Novelty is all about a baby without the dog.
I say, my dear David, good old times revived, eh? You and I
remember Edward Wright (and if you don't, our excellent friend
John Lawrence Toole does) at the Adelphi, when people went to
see Wright and Bedford, and used to split their sides over a broad
—a very broad—farce in one Act and one Scene. And four times out
of seven wasn't there a baby in those farces ?—a baby who was
invariably hidden away in any plaoe that came first, the top drawer,
a shelf of a cupboard, a portmanteau, anywhere, in faot, where it
might have a good chance of being smothered, suffocated, sat upon,
and so shamefully and yet so oomioally ill-treated that when, after
upsetting a heavy trunk and a few articles of furniture on to the top
of something or other that went crack, Mr. Wright suddenly
ezolaimed, "Good gracious! I've smashed the babby!" the audi-
ence would scream with irrepressible mirth. Did you ever send
your Wife to CambtrweU t was one of these farces; and in Web-
ster's Royal Red Book, which was, I think, a farce in three Acts,
or, at all events, in several Scenes, there was much the same equivoque
about the dog and the baby as there is in Confusion.
In the column of " Opinions of the Press," whioh heralded the 200th
or 250th nifrht of Confusion, I saw the opinion of the Standard's Critic
quoted. The satirical rogue had, it seems, actually praised Confusion
as a good specimen of "Modern Comedy. Rather hard this on the
Author of Our Boys and CyrWs Success, for example, not to men-
tion other writers of Comedy more or less successful. Confusion is
just as much a Comedy (in our English sense of the word) as were
the old Adelphi Farces above mentioned, of which Messrs. Wright,
Paul Bedford, 0. Smith (who was immense in Did you ever send
your Wife to CambtrweU t), the youthful Eburne, and the inimitable
Miss Woolgab were the life ana soul. Confusion is well acted by
everyone exoept Mr. Henry Neville, who seemed thoroughly out of
his element, and was only not quite so bad as Mr. John Clayton in
that One-Aot Burlesque (1 forget its title) which, after being so
suooessf ul at a Gaiety Matinee when played by Actors who understood
that line of business, proved such a dead failure when done (to death)
at the Court by Actors who didn't.
And now, my dear David, where are you coming out? Are you in
The Rivals at the Haymarket? You 'd like to know the oast for
that piece, would you'( Well, there are many reports about it,—
nothing like getting up these mysterious reports, circulating whispers
"in oonfidenoe," you know—telling all the details "as a secret"
whioh "won't go beyond these four walls, of course," or "mustn't
on any aooount go beyond this table "—(but walls have ears, and
tables have talked before now)—it's the best and subtlest and
genteelest form of advertising,—well, as I was saying, there are
many reports about, and you, whether engaged or not in the piece,
have heard something about it, but not everything. Isn't your old
friend "Nibbs " likely to know P Isn't his version of what is going
to be done at the Haymarket as good, nay, isn't it probably better
than anybody else's?
Well, then, hark in thine ear:—Mr. Bancroft, with admirable
tact and judgment, has secured the services of Mr. Wills (Poet and
Painter, and Author of Charles I., &o., &c.,) to edit and generally
re-arrange Sheridan's Rivals. It will be put into form just as the
School for Seandal was put into form at the Prince of Wales's (Con-
suls Bancrofto), and just as Garrick, Kemble, Kean, Macreadt.
Phelps, Charles Kean, and Irving have chopped and changed and
re-arranged Sdakspeare to suit the taste of their Nineteenth-Cen-
tury audiences. Since Shakspeare's own time, I will venture to
say that no Manager has ever put a play of the Divine William's on
the Stage as he wrote it. Ana quite right, too, if the Manager is to
be credited with understanding his own business. As to Sheridan's
Rivals, the scenes between Faulkland and Julia should come out by
handfuls. They are bores, nuisances, sentimental twaddles, as
tedious as Clarissa Harlowe, Lovelace, Grandison, <§• Co.
The only time I ever remember Faulkland tolerable, was when the
Actor had emptied on to his wig a boxful of powder, which, on his
striking his forehead, despairingly, flew up Julia's nose, and set her
sneezing. The sneezing was infectious, and the scene ended in such
a sneezing match between the two otherwise tedious lovers as sent
the audience into fits of laughter. If Mr. Lionel Brouoh is engaged
for Faulkland, no doubt he will introduce this business, and Mrs.
Bancroft will be inimitable as Julia. This will be real Comedy.
Bancroft, as Sir Lucius, will be the big hit of the piece, I venture
to prophesy. Whether Mrs. Bernard Beere or Miss Anderson is
to play Mrs. Malaprop is at present uncertain, but either of them
would evidentlv be admirable m the part of the " weather-beaten old
she-dragon." The Editor will probably suppress all coarseand vulgar
allusions to Mrs. Malaprop's personal appearance, and, of course,
Sir Lucius will no longer address her as old Gentlewoman," or
repudiate her as Delia, with " You Delia! pho! pho! be easy,"—and
Sir Anthony's extravagant compliment as to her being "in her
bloom yet," given with a glance aside at the audience, will be taken
au serteux. The Bancrofts have the credit of sparing no expense
and doing things well,—and Mr. Bancroft's truly practical motto
has always been " If you want a part well played, play it yourself,"
—so that it is no wonder that their ideally-perfect cast for the piece
should be as follows:—
Sir Anthony Absolute Mr. Augustus Harris.
Captain Absolute Mr. Harry Jackson.
Faulkland {with a song) Mr. Arthur Roberts.
Bob Acres Mr. Arthur Stirling.
Sir Lucius O' Trigger Mr. Bancroft.
Mrs. Malaprop (in classic costume) . . Miss Mart Anderson.
Lydia Languish Mrs. Bancroft.
Julia (with a dance) LoTTA.
Lucy Mrs. Bernard Beere.
The notion of getting the veteran, Mr. Walter Lact, to shave off
his beard and moustache, and come out of his retirement to play
Sir Anthony, of securing Miss Victor for Mrs. Malaprop, Miss
Marie Linden for Lydia Languish, yourself, my dear David, for
Bob Acres (what a Bob Acres you would be!), and Mr. Herbert
Standing for Sir Lucius O' Trigger, is of oourse absurd on the very
face of it. Mr. Bancroft has, we hear, not succeeded in persuading
Mr. Wilson Barrett to give up Claudian for Faulkland. Catch
Mr. Barrett allowing anything to be cut out of the scenes between
himself and Julia, exoept, of course, some of Julia's lines. But
he would have the useless scenes between the Absolutes, Acres, and
Sir Lucius, and so forth, considerably reduced. But if you, my dear
David, were going to play Faulkland, you wouldn't out everybody
else down, and have it all to yourself, would you? Not you, my
dear David. You like everybody to have their little bit, and you
don't want a great big slice for yourself. You 're too much of an
Artist for that, aren't you, David P
If I hear any further news of things theatrical, I '11 let you know,
as you've been rather " out of it" lately. Best wishes from
Your old friend, Nibbs.

safely back again by that time.

"Sheets" and
(Point) Blank-hits.
WAITING FOR THE WAGON.
The following further correspondence relating to the recent treat-
ment of travellers by the Trans-Continental and General Practical
Joking No - chance - of - getting - any- sleep - at-all
Car and Carriages Company has been forwarded
to Mr. Punch tor publication:—
Snt,—I have read the lines of your Correspondent
"A Permanent Lunatic," and I can endorse
nearly every word of what he says. Recovering
from a thirteen years' illness and with nerves so
shattered that the mere fall of a housemaid from
the top of the house to the bottom with a tray
f ull oi glass and china caused me to start in my
chair, I was ordered by my Doctor complete rest
in the Caucasus. To avoid any approach to noise
or excitement on the journey, which I had been
warned would be fatal, I had had my boots
muffled and my head enveloped in medioated
cotton wool, while I had, as a still further precau-
tionary measure to ensure repose, taken just before
starting an almost dangerously powerful sleeping draught. Thus
prepared I was carefully placed in my "wagon-lit," the other three
in my compartment being occupied respectively by my two elderly
maiden Aunts in whose temporary charge I was travelling, and by an
invalid Gentleman, a sufferer like myself, who said he had completely
lost the use of his legs in an accident at a Fancy Fair.
For the first three or four hours, at least so I was given to under-
stand, all went fairly well; till, at about a quarter to two in the
morning, a sudden bursting in of the floor of the carriage with a
noise like thunder, accompanied by a ripping off of the entire roof
into a thousand splinters, announced to us the unwelcome fact that
the six wheels of the car had simultaneously shot from their axles,
and that there was, in fact, something wrong somewhere. At first
we would not believe it, and, as we had paid in advance for our
places, this was natural. We, however, were soon rudely awakened
to the fact. One of the officials of the train, in an excited and
insolent manner, hurled us from our oouches, and commanded us
instantly to jump out on to the up line and walk to Bouvieres, the
next station, thirty-five miles distant. This I declined to do, and
insisted on my right to stay where I was until my arrival at the
Caucasus. At the same time I courteously showed my ticket. All
remonstrance was, however, vain; the official merely produced a
horsewhip, with the result that, ill as I was, and feeble as we all
were, half-dressed, hungry, and for the greater part of the time in
violent hysterics, we had to accomplish the whole distance, in a
north-east wind, accompanied by a blinding sleet, mingled with
terriflo showers of tropical hail. And this took us twenty-nine hours
on foot!
To make matters worse, on our arrival at our destination, we were
instantly thrown into the common gaol as tramps, and neither a civil
explanation in excellent French, nor the offer of a small money bribe
could satisfy the Authorities. I should add that our invalid com-
pagnon de voyage was without further ado peremptorily sent to take
a turn on the prison treadmill for "insubordination," and I have not
seen or heard anything of him since. As to my two elderly maiden
Aunts, they were both, muoh to my annoyanoe, buried this morning,
and I shall now be obliged, at great personal inconvenience, to return
to town for the purpose of soliciting the assistance of two others. I
need scarcely say I am not so well as when I started, and yet my
Lawyer tells me that I have no redress. Comment is superfluous.
I am, Sir, yours, &o.
B-ESISTER.
Sir,—Tour grumbling Correspondents deserve all they get for
patronising the Company at all. I am continually travelling to all
parts of the Continent, and though a very light sleeper, I invariably
seleot a night journey whenever 1 can manage it. But I see to my
own comfort myself. All your Correspondent " Ttmtdus" has to do
is to take a six-foot flock-mattress, and feather-bed, bolster, and
pillow to match, and'three good-sized blankets and a counterpane
tnto the carriage with him on starting. If the other passengers, as
they sometimes will, object, let him sensibly take no heed of them,
but spread out his extemporised bed-gear in the middle of the car-
riage, and, as soon as it is firmly fixed, jump into it as quickly as he
can, and draw the blankets over his head. His companions will now
be not only surprised but so jammed into their places as to be quite
unable even to summon the Guard. If the latter should happen to
look in for tickets, a bit of good-humoured banter, backed by a
shilling, will instantly quiet him. I have travelled all over Europe
in this fashion; and though I have now and then had a hit of a
souffle, I have only been fairly thrown out into a tunnel, with my
belongings, seventeen times. Experto Crede.
Sir,—Tour Correspondent "Bacchanal," who paid for a ticket
from London to Palermo, and has not been allowed to use it, wishes
to know how he is to get any compensation from the Company. I
will tell him. Let him, the first time he catches a dangerous fever,
hurry off with his medical man to Charing Cross, and take his tioket
—say for Genoa. He gets into the car, and at once takes to his bed.
Now he has the pull of the Company. On arriving at his destination,
he is requested to get np and leave the carriage, Trat the demand is
instantly met by the medical adviser, who, telling the official not to
make ,so much noise, produces a certificate to the effect that the
patient is in a condition that will not admit of his being disturbed,
and the train again starts on its return journey. The process is
repeated, and may, with judgment, be often almost indefinitely pro-
longed. I can vouch for the fact that this is thoroughly practicable,
for 1 recommended it to a friend only last month, and had he not
unfortunately died on the third journey home, he might even now
have been profiting by the advice of One Who Knows.
Sir,—In answer to the letter of "Lei "I have merely to point
out to him that under the Company's Act, 39 Vict. o. 4, s. 15,
it will be found that by a special Dye-law that has never been
questioned, all that in their dealings with the publio the Company
guarantee is "to issue them their tickets." Trusting that this will
be a sufficient rejoinder to " Lex," and those, who like him, imagine
that the mere payment of a fare involves any obligation other than of
a purely imaginative and arbitrary character.
I am, your obedient Servant,
The Chairman.
SOME MORE "QUESTIONS OF THE DAY."
Mr. Cropper. To ask the Under-Secretary to the Local Govern-
ment Board what the population of England is likely to be in 1900?
what is the name, age, and residence of his hatter P how many her-
rings could in his opinion be bought for an outlay of a shilling, on
the supposition that one-and-a-half are purchasable at three half-
eence, and whether he will submit the calculations on which he bases
is opinion, in the form of a Parliamentary Paper, to the House?
and, finally, whether the Government will consider the advisability
of admitting the Secretary of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful
Knowledge to a permanent seat on the Treasury Bench?
Mr. Labouchere. To ask the Home Secretary whether any
Gentleman is now at liberty to burn the bodies either of himself or
of his nearest relatives, in consequence of some extra-judicial (but
perhaps not extra-judioious) dicta which had happened to fall from
one of the Puisne Judges P
Sir H. Maxwell. To ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether
the elderly female recently appointed to sweep out the Post-Office at
Maresnest, is not the great-aunt of a person who once acted as
assistant to a firm of Dust Contractors who cleaned out the dust-hole
of a former Liberal Agent for that borough P
Mr. M. Guest. To ask the Vioe-Presid at of the Council whether
it is the case that one of the infants at the Stoke Poeis Board School
has been compelled to learn by heart the whole of Mr. Gladstone's
Midlothian Speeches, the Faerie Queen and the Novum Organon-; and
whether the intellect of the infant is likely to survive the strain.
Mr. W. Marriott. To ask the President of the Board of Trade
whether an Emissary from Birmingham, stationed at St. Martin's-le-
Grand, with instructions to peruse and report upon all post-oards
sent by Conservative Members of Parliament, has not, in a fit of
remorse, attempted suioide and arson, after compounding with his
oreditors for payment of twopenoe-farthing in the pound.
Lord A. Percy. The height, breadth, and other dimensions of all
recruits of Her Majesty's Army.
Lord R. Churchill. The blood relations, views on politics, and

appointed.
Mr. Macliver. To ask the Attorney-General if the Polioe have
any knowledge of the present whereabouts of the Publio Prosecutor,
and when and also where that functionary was last heard of.
Any Numrer of Members. To ask any and every Member of
the Government a string of the most ill-timed and inconvenient
questions (embellished with extracts from speeches in Midlothian and
elsewhere) as to the operations in Egypt, with the object of getting
some declaration out of Ministers which will entirely undo the good
effeot of the viotories of General Graham, Btill further jeopardise
Gordon's mission and life, and the general position of the English
in that oountry.
The One Question put by Mr. Punch, M.P. (for the United
Kingdom generally). To ask the Speaker if all this useless talk
can't be stopped, and the real business of the oountry proceeded

A BIT 0' TRESH MEAT.
{A Poor Wife's Views on the Cattle Question.)
An! it 'b all very well; they may talk and may talk,
And it's little I know of tneir meaning at best,
And political cheese and political chalk
May be like or nnlike, when it's put to the test.
Bnt I know that trade is bad,
And my John with the fever is down;
And I know what a small bit o' meat's to be had
For the ohange o' one's only half-crown!
No, it wasn't so cruel twice ten year agone
When John was stronger and I was young,
And at fourpenoe a pound—late at night—I have known
The primest of spare-ribs or aitoh-bones, well hung
And tender as marrow, chucked in at our bid;
"Weigh there, two-and-eight!" was the butcherman'a cry.
Ah! we relished our marketing then, that we did,
In the flush of our young married life, John and I.
But now—well, John grows grey,
Rheumatics unstraighten the sturdiest lad;
I seem to get sourer, somehow, day by day,
And Trade s so bad!
A bit o' fresh meat! That's his longing, poor chap;
Very natural too,—I have felt it myself,
When Sunday's meal's gone to its very last sorap,
And there's nothing but bread and Dutch-oheese on the shelf.
Seems greedy, it may be,—she hinted as much,
Our prim Lady-Visitor; ah! but you see,
To keep up his strength against sickness's touch,
A labourer needs more than 'taters and tea.
Work down at the Docks it work,—
At six in the winter 'tis oold.
Joinr never teas one to skulk or shirk,
And he's growing old'
A bit o' fresh meat! I suppose they can't guess
What that means to a man,—or a woman, sometimes,—
How should they? A Duke doesn't dine any less
If the price goes up twenty per cent, upon " primes ";
But a penny a pound upon offal or scraps,
Or tuppence on small Sunday joints—(they 're a treat
That don t always come to our husbands, poor ohaps'.)—
Just draws the hard line betwixt meat and no meat!
Don't believe it, perhaps? Why, no!
Seems funny, no doubt—to you Swells;
We women, however, whose pennies come slow,
Can tell what they 're worth, and must watch how they go.
What means a meat-dinner when prices are low
In places where Poverty dwells,
Means cheer o' the heart and a flush o' the oheek t
My Lords and such-like as seem to seek
To keep 'em high, if you had to come
Late o' Saturday night from a slushy slum,
Like me and many a woman more,
With a bit of a bag and a sixpence, or less,
To chaffer and scheme for the Sunday's mess,
To turn " block-ornaments " o'er and o'er
And try for the piok of the musty pile,
Till even the butcher—with hall a smile—
Shouts, "Now, then, Missis there, when you have done!"
And find at last that the money won't run
To even a pound among five!
Perhaps you might own that all's not right,
Though our flocks and herds" are fair to the i
Though Law may have shut out the Murrain's I
Though Dukes and Dealers no longer fight,
Though Farmers no more may complain of their plight,
And Butchers flourish and thrive!

THINGS ONE WOULD RATHER HAVE LEFT UNSAID.

AS8URS YOU!"
GOING A-BEGGING.
The Constituency of Muchstir appears to experience considerable difficulty in
securing a suitable Parliamentary representative. It has been "going the
rounds " of the Seers and Prophets, and superior persons generally, in search of
some one willing to become a Candidate, but at present without success. The
replies, however, which Muchstir has received to such applications constitute a
most interesting and valuable precis of what may be called the Higher Politics,
politics whioh in Jupiter or Saturn, in the realms of the Platonic Ideal, or m
vacuo would doubtless be estimated at their right value, but which, unhappily,
are considerably "above the heads" of the Man in the Street and the Member at
St. Stephen's. Some extracts from the replies received by the Local Association
may be of public interest.
Professor SHerbert Poz says:—
"Many thanks for your invitation, which is doubtless intended as a compli-
ment to the Higher Intellect and the Political Oversoul—in my person. The
compliment is unfortunately misjudged and misdirected. The Higher Intellect,
like the Ideal Pegasus, cannot work in harness, political or otherwise. I am
pledged to certain unchangeable—because absolutely oorrect and final—opinions
on every conceivable topic, which I could not waive for a moment or in deference
to any possible majority. One of these opinions is, that all Parties in Parliament
are entirely wrong about everything. I could not possibly, therefore, agree or
act with any Party. There is only too much reason to fear that all Parties would
not unite to agree and act with Me. Obstinacy and Unreason, so dominant in
these days, would, alas! prevent that desirable consummation. I will not say
that I am not fit for Parliament. The Philosopher is fit for anything. But
Parliament, as at present constituted and oonducted, is emphatically not fit for
Me! How could / follow the lead either of a voluble, emotional, sophistical
Sciolist, or of a molluscous platitudinarian Philistine?
"I have, of course, a political programme as complete as Comte and as clean-
cut as a silhouette. But would Parliament submit to my intellectual scissors P
I should snip too muoh for the Tories, and shear too little for the Radicals. I
should cut away all State excrescences, such as Churches and Colonies. I should
cut down the power of the State in every possible way. I am opposed to com-
pelling people to be honest, or sober, or unoppressive, or non-homicidal. I am
opposed to all kinds of compulsion save one. 1 would
compel people to be free. That would cure everything.
"No, Gentlemen, the Positive Philosopher cannot at
present find rest for the sole of his intellectual foot at St.
Stephen's. He can put that foot down as heavily as he
pleases in the Press, and nobody says rude things to him.
But in Parliament it would tread on Party corns all
round, and those who were hurt instead of getting out of
the way would resent, howl, perhaps kick. So, unless you
could secure me the position of Autocratic Leader of all
Parties at Westminster, I think I can do more justice to
myself, and more service to the Universe, as Intellectual
Ruler of the Pan- Cosmical Review."
Mr. Diontsius Dusk writes:—
"No! emphatically and eternally No! To be Aroh-
Cackler in Chaos, who, save a miscreated and malign
Nincompoop, would sacrifice the Supernal Complacenoy
of Egoistio Isolation in Conceptual Cosmos? It is like
your Cockney impudence, and I will see you eternally
dephlogisticated first! Member for Muchstir? Bah!
I am Member for all the Infinities, and most of the
Magnificencies, for the Mellifluous Memnon-Melodies,
and the glittering Cohort of Golden Silences! In your
machine-made Ape-ridden Palaver Shop at Westminster
I should be as a new Prometheus stretched out on an arid
Caucus-us range, harried and liver-torn by the Voluble
Vultures of what they fatuously call free Debate! Would
they listen in soul-stricken silence to my dicta? Would
they vote in unbroken unanimity at my nod? Would
they not yearn to 'argue'? Would they not itch to ' re-
ply '? Of what avail then my Presence in their midst?
Go to, foolish political postulants! Put your anserine heads
in a (Gladstone) bag! Leave me, leave me, ye Caucus-
confounded Cacklers,—' alone witn the stars'!!!!!!"
Mr. Osric Lutestring thus lyrically responds:—
You ask me—why I cannot say—
To stand for Muchstir! Vastly well!
The "ting " of the Division bell
Sheep may regard, but Singers ?—nay!
Political bell-wethers lead
Their foolish flocks to either lobby—
"Run in," like tipplers by a Bobby.
Shall Bards do ditto P No, indeed!
A nectar-drinker, I, and not_
A tippler of mere Party spirit.
A Poet of superior merit
Looks upon all Reform " as rot.
Form is the thing. There is no form
In Parliament. The Art of Belt
Is better; there all outlines melt,
Like waxworks when the weather's warm.
Inchoate chaos, muddy flux!
The Bard might serve them well indeed,
If, Whig or Tory, they would heed
His bland unbiassed fiat lux!
But no, Apelles in the Court
Of Huddlestone were happier far
Than Poet at the Commons bar
In an impromptu ode cut short.
I seem to see the Speaker's frown,
The "rise to order," and the ruling;
Next day's report. "After much fooling,
The speaker suddenly sat down."
"The Honourable Member thinks,
'Twould seem, that the Egyptian mess
May be cleared up with much suooess,
By Songs to Memnon or the Sphinx I"
It will not do, not quite, not quite!
That Parliament is out of joint
Is very clear, but—here's the point!—
I was not born to set it right!
It is understood that Muchstir has given up the idea of
seeking a Candidate amongst those Greater Lights that
lighten—in books and reviews—our political darkness.
Sic itur ad astra is an excellent motto. But, unfortu-
nately, in this case, the "Stars" that Muohstir has gone
to have refused to shine upon that aspiring Constituency.
Some think so much the better for the Constituency, and
for Parliament also.

THE UTILISATION OF
BALD HEADS.
From the following Advertise-
ment in the Morning Pott we see
how it is possible to make bald-
ness profitable, and how personal
unsigntliness may be turned to
good account:—
WANTED, TWENTY BALD-
HEADED MEN, as PERAM-
BULATING SIGNS, willing to have
the words,
burnt in on the back of their
Apply for address, &o.
It speaks well for the enterprise
of the age to find that a hitherto
untried field for advertising has
been discovered. Blank walls,
hoardings, pavements, and rail-
way stations have long ago heen
used up, but this startling notion
opens up a rare channel for re-
munerative employment. Of
course the remuneration would
depend upon the society in which
the advertiser moved, and no
doubt the promoters of the scheme
would make it well worth the
while of Dukes in difficulties or
impecunious Bishops to have
their heads extensively tattooed
for the glorification of some vast
commercial speculation. The idea
is quite worthy of the immortal
BaRNUM.
The Cheep Officer in COM-
MAND AT THE COMING VOLUNTEEE

cording to the published orders,

DELIGHT OF THE LAST OF THE BARONS
On hearing that his Judgment had been Affirmed by the
Court above.
A PROTEST FROM POWDER
AND PLUSH.
The Sunday morning Bitting of
the House of Commons nas caused
the greatest sensation in the Ser-
vants' Hall. The Globe has in-
formed us how Messengers arrived
from the House of Commons at
the residences of those Members
who were quietly sleeping in their
beds, and knocked up about
thirty households at six in the
morning. The aforesaid M.P.'s
started forth in all haste, but on
arriving at the House, they found
the doors just closed. Subse-
quently, telegrams were sent
round from the Government
Whips, apologising for thus dis-
turbing the senatorial slumbers.
The matter, however, will not
end here. A meeting has since
been convened under the presi-
dency of Mr. Jeames de la
Pluche. Among the speakers
were Mr. John Smauker, Mr.
Whiffebs, and Mr. Tuckle. A
strong protest was made against
this inconsiderate behaviour on
the part of the Government, and
a remonstrance was addressed
to the Premier, saying that this
kind of thing must' not occur
again, and, if it does, the whole
of Flunkeydom will at once with-
draw their support from Mr.
Gladstone's Administration.
The Church Nautical.
Says Willis, "It seems clear to
me,
Though Harcourt chaffs and
jeers,
A Bishop s place is out at See,
And not among the Piers!"
FAREWELL TO THE NATIVE.
[An article in the Standard points out that real Native Oysters are increas-
ingly difficult to obtain, the marketable stock being all but exhausted, but
gives hopes for the future in the development of Oyster-farming.]
Oh, dear Native Oyster, don't say that you 're banish'd
From places where greatly you flourished of old;
'Tis true that for long you've been dear, and have vanish'd
Except when a Croesus his stores can unfold.
Is Whitstable hare, and is Colchester beaten
By queer foreign rivals ?—it cannot be true.
One day will the last of the Natives be eaten,
And nothing avail that the gourmet can do!
Don't tell us of strange Anglo-Dutch, which are flabby,
Don't let the American send his Blue Point;
Each fat Anglo-French is as pale as a " babby,"
And never can put Native nose out of joint.
They may do quite well for a scallop or sauces.
They serve for a soup when 'tis artfully made;
But for a half dozen to prelude the courses,
The Native puts all other sorts in the shade.
And so let us hope that new beds for the Oyster
Will prosper as others have done we've been told;
That good spat" will fall, and the product be moister
And fatter than even the Natives of old.
0 cynical Mallock, life is not worth living.
Unless a fair Oyster can gleam on the dish;
So let your Punch hope that next year will be giving
A better supply of the King of Shellfish!
Mrs, Ramsbotham tells us that a young friend of hers, who is a
most accomplished Italian scholar, is now occupied in turning the
sonnets of Plutarch into English.
A CAPITAL JOKE; OR, WHAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN.
Lord H. to Admiral H.—Congratulations! But it is a pity he
escaoed. Am asked such awkward questions every night and have
nothing to reply. Can't something decisive be done?
Admiral B. to Lord II.—Have done it. It will cost £5,000, but I
think I've got a surprise for you.
Lord H. to Admiral //.—Splendid! Never mind expense. What
is it? What have you done?
Admiral H. to Lord H.—Offered £5,000 for 0. D.'s head.
Lord II. to Admiral H.—Capital:—that is—I '11 just look at the
papers: for it strikes me on second thoughts—wait a moment for
further instructions.
Admiral H. to Lord H.—No use! Too late! Have sent out
20,000 posters in my own Arabic. Am expecting head to turn up
every minute.
Lord H. to Admiral H.—Good heavens! Call all posters in at
once! Only one opinion about it! Great mistake. You'll be the
ruin of us. Wire back latest particulars.
Admiral H. to Lord H.—Certainly. Five heads have just come
in. What am I to do?
Lord H. to Admiral H.—Return them at once with thanks.
Admiral H. to Lord H.—Have. Nasty business all the same.
Hope you 're satisfied?
Lord H. to Admiral H.—Thoroughly.
Change of Name.—In commemoration of the sudden retreat of
the French after their recent advance towards the Chinese frontier, it
has been decided that their latest acquisition in Annam shall be in
future known as There-and-Back Ninh.
"The only tenants Mr. Clifford Lloyd could find to evict in
Egypt," said an Irish M.P., "were the tenants of the prisons, and
he at once evicted a hundred and twenty of 'em."

BXTRACTP.D FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 17.—Got to work again at
four this afternoon quite refreshed after long rest. Home little
before six on Sunday morning, which was great boon. Might have
sat all day and had our Sunday's sermon brought us between two
plates, as the British workman's wife carries her lord's meal.
Suppose that will come later in the Session. At present revel in
comparative leisure and prolonged rest. Expected fresh row at
Question Time. On Saturday Lyctlph Stanley made rude remark
about Tim Healy. Tim very properly indignant. Threatened to
tell the Speaker and have Lyulph whipped. On reflection thought
better of it. Perhaps have brought up referenoe to some of his own
remarks. Needn't go back later than Thursday when he accused
Trevelyan of conspiracy to murder and Sexton accused Lord
Spencer of lying and cheating and suborning witnesses.
"Wish he d come on," said Edward Clarke, "Reminds me of my
first brief. Client a professional garotter whose hat had been plav-
fully_ beaten in by a passing policeman. Insisted upon having the
practical joker prosecuted."
As it was Randolph had to make a little play. He, also, shocked
at strong language. Dilke observed on Saturday Fred Burnaby
not under military compulsion to shoot Arabs with shotted gun.
That, Randolph says, is insult to whole British Army, and insists
upon Hartington repudiating Dilke. Result of scene not quite
what Randolph designed. Meant to vindicate order in House, and
put down growing practice of using strong language. Result, a
squabble, with flat contradictions flying around, House in uproar;
only Randolph calm and possessed, sometimes waving down irate
Radicals, anon with folded arms and darkened brow frowning reproach
on Dilke, and singeing Hartington with lightning of his wrath.
"So like his great ancestor," Wolff said_, admiringly, "The fellow
who used, doncna, to' ride upon the whirlwind and direct the storm.'"
Sitting given up to Colonels, who discussed various matters, shunt-
ing the Secretary for War on to midnight, when he explained
Estimates in wearied House. Colonel Milne Home introduced new
Parliamentary procedure. Common thing for Member after delivering
exciting harangue to conclude by sitting on his hat. Home first man
to sit on another fellow's. General Alexander secured corner seat
meaning to make a speech. Beat temporary retreat; left his hat there,
sort of flagstaff to mark his position. Home, returning from charge
against system of examining Army officers for promotion, plumped
down on nat. Diligently straightened it out, and brushed it in vain
effort to make it look as if nothing particular had happened. Pretty
Alexander returned, furtively watching to see
whether he noticed anything. Alexander did, but, concluding that
it was the Government who were at bottom of it^only shook his Read.
"What can you expect," he said to Sir Walter Barttelot,
"from a Ministry that has Gladstone at its head and Chamberlain
with his Caucus at its back. Even our hats are not safe."
B'itiness done.—Army Estimates in.Committee.
Tuesday.—House still talking of Haecourt's great speech of
Saturday, after Division on Labby's well-meant Amendment.
"So, said the Home Secretary, on Saturday, caressing his
bountiful chin, "this dirty trick hasn't succeeded, after all."
Only nine words (same number as the Muses, Lord Mayor
reminds me) but full of point. Question is, what's going to be
done for Hicks-Beach f Only for Sir Michael, who, sitting with
All Angels on Front Bench, overheard oration, the speech would
have had very limited audience, and immense advantage to Liberal
Partv of having case put in nutshell for popular use lost.
"We must do something for Beach," Hartington said, as he
took a cup of tea with Gladstone on Sunday.
"Hicksackly," said the Premier. But nothing more passed at
the time, William being limited, by order of Andrew Clark, to
one word per quarter of an hour.
Labby going about triumphant after his little game of Saturday.
"You nearly left us without a Ministry," I said to him. "Fine
fun, but what about your Constituents r How do they like your
coalescing with Randolph and Parnell to turn out our only
Government?"
"My constituents are all right," said Labby, " as long as I stick
to Bradlaugh, and move to reduce Votes on account of the Royal
Family. As to Egyptian politics, they 're altogether muddled. Don't
know the difference between Osman Digna and Osman Morgan."
Horning Sitting to-day to pass Second Reading of Cattle Plague Bill.
Both sides anxious to see Bill getting on. Got on very well up to
eighteen minutes to seven, when Kenny appeared on scene, and string-
ing words together for space of twelve minutes, talked the Bill out.
"Seen a good deal in the way of degradation of House of Com-
mons," saidGoscHEN, feeling in wrong place for his eye-glass, "but
this the most striking exemplification that occurs to me. Here's
a national interest demands legislation. Two great parties of the
State agree to legislate. Special arrangements made for discussing
measure. Valuable debate takes place. Bill about to be read Second
Time, when there appears on the scene a Manchester counter-skipper,
who, undertaking occasionally to blacken Parnell's boots, is made
Member of Parliament. Chatters for a few minutes and all the
labour of the day destroyed, and legislation indefinitely postponed.
A great Institution House of Commons, but evidently not adapted to
the times."
House Counted Out at nine o'clock. Business done.—None.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Wednesday.—Much shaking of the head over Randolph to-day.
Not only gave his support to Broadhtjrst's Bill for the Compulsory
Purohase of Leaseholds, but spoke disrespectfully of a Duke.
"It's all very well for him to have a lark, doncha," said Mr.
Christopher Sykes, who had obtained the freehold of a new pair of
gloves for the occasion; "but, demmy, when it comes to saying a
man may buy his ground-rent if he afford to pay for it, the Con-
stitooshun's in danger. Besides, the way he talks of Dookes makes
my blood run cold. Shouldn't wonder if he were to attack Me next!"
To avoid which Christopher hurried out of the House.
Business done.—Leasehold Bill rejected by 168 votes to 104.
Overtures made to Randolph to join Radical Party. "You could
worry Gladstone much better from this side," Labby said. Ran-
dolph promises to think it over. Tory indignation against blameless
Randolph immeasurable. "Lord 'Henry George'Churchill," they
bitterly call him. But Randolph, as usual, knows what he's about.
Thursday Midnight.—Been here all night. Just made private
arrangements with elderly Messengers to oarry me out as if I were
Bradlauoh. Siok in soul, worn out in body. Hour-and-half spent
in wrangling over Questions. Only two out of the ninety-eight
proper to be put in House of Commons. Then Campbell-Banner-
man ready to explain the Navy Estimates. Minister and interests of
perhaps greatest department of State set aside, whilst half-a-dozen
Members wobble round miscellaneous subjects more or less nearly
connected with Navy. Now it is Midnight. Camfbell-Bannerman
up, and real business of Sitting commenoes. Treasury driven to last
ditch. Must have Vote, so House going to sit all night.
How long will oountry stand this nightly spectacle, I wonder? Used
to be very indignant about St. Panoras Board of Guardians. Their busi-
ness way perfect compared with ours. Must be an end of this. British
Lion be roaring around presently, putting a Question of its own.
"Here, you fellows," I fancy I near B. L. roaring in the Lobby.
"You clear out quick. I sent you here to do my business, of which
there's plenty standing around.. Instead of that you Bquabble at
Question Time; you dawdle from seven to ten; then you begin a
fresh row. At half-past twelve you say you want to go home.
Ministers at wits' end, protest certain Vote must be.fpassed before
the House rises. Then you divide: go on dividing for an hour
during which business in hand might have been got through. Finally
settle down and, half asleep, vote my money by the million without
inquiry. You sit on Saturdays and you desecrate Sundays with
coarse vituperation. I know very well who are the prime movers in
this plot and who keep Pandemonium going. But responsibility rests
with Ministers, with the Majority, and with the Authorities of the
House. I look to them to restore House of Commons to condition of
decency and will support them in the enterprise. They can do it and
they must do it without a week's delay."
Nice party B. L. when his moustaohe bristles. Hard to rouse, but
when once on rampage not pleasant to meet him in narrow place like
House of Commons.

Solicitor.
The Duke (finishing a long business talk). And I suppose we had
better be represented oy Mr. Sllvertongue, the Queen s Counsel?
Mr. Kosts (hesitating). Certainly, your Grace, if it is your express
wish.
The Duke (surprised). Why, Mr. Kosts, you surely know of£no
better representative?
Mr. Kosts (hurriedly). Oh no, your Grace. Mr. Sllvertongue is
a most eloquent advocate, and "has the law at his fingers' ends;
but
The Duke. Well? Surely we may entrust ourselves in his hands
with perfect confidence P Do you not think so?
Mr. Kosts. Oh, certainly, your Grace, certainly. (Hesitating.)
But matters have changed a little lately. There has been an altera-
tion in the law.
The Duke. Indeed!
Mr. Kosts. Yes, your Grace. The fact is, that the two branches
of the legal profession have been amalgamated.
The Duke. I don't quite understand.
Mr. Kosts. Why, your Grace, there is now no real distinction
between Solicitors and Barristers, except in name. So I thought,
your Grace, that as I could do the work as well, that perhaps I might
replace Mr. Silvertongue, and You see it is simply a matter
of business.
The Duke (interrupting). Certainly, certainly, Mr. Kosts. No
doubt you could'represent me admirably. But you see I am afraid
Mr. Sllvertongue might be a little offended. You know he is a
personal friend of mine, and
Mr. Kosts (promptly, with a bow). I trust your Grace will not
give the matter another thought — Mr. Silvertongue shall be
instructed. (Preparing to go.) Of course, your Grace's young rela-
tive, the Honourable Charles Needy, will aot as Junior P
The Duke. Certainly, Mr. Kosts. Give Charley as much of my
work as possible. My wife's cousin, I am afraid, is not overburdened
with briefs.
Mr. Kosts. I am afraid not, your Grace. And yet Mr. Needy is a
sharp and clever young Gentleman. Good day, your Grace!
The Duke (after a moment's thought, suddenly). One moment, Mr.
Kosts. Did I understand you to say that the two branches of the
legal profession were amalgamated?
Mr. Kosts. To all intents and purposes, your Grace. You see we
can now do all the work of the Bar.
The Duke. And I suppose Barristers can aot as Solicitors—I mean,
undertake the same kind of business P
Mr. Kosts (laughing). There is nothing to prevent them, your
Grace, save their incapacity P
The Duke (with dignity). No relative of the Duchess, Mr. Kosts,
can be incapable!
Mr. Kosts (puzzled). I beg your Grace's pardon. I do not quite
understand
The Duke. Then I will explain. You tell me that Barristers can
now act as Solicitors. Well, you know the old adage, that "blood
is thicker than water," It is, Mr. Kosts; it is. You will pardon
me, I am sure, if I suggest that the connection of your firm with my
family has not been uniucrative.
Mr. Kosts. On the contrary, your Graoe! I may fairly say that
the connection is worth many hundreds a-year to us. We cannot be
sufficiently grateful.
The Duke. Pray desist, Mr. Kosts. The matter is one of pure
business. It really is not at all a question of gratitude. Well, as I
understand you to say that Mr. Needy is quite qualified to under-
take Solicitor's work
Mr. Kosts. (blankly). Theoretically, your Grace; theoretically.
The Duke (haughtily). Any relative of the Duchess can reduce
theory to practice.
Mr. Kosts (botoing). No doubt, your Grace; no doubt.
The Duke. Well, as I now find that Charley can do the work I
have hitherto given to you, Mr. Kosts, I feel that some alteration
must be made. Charley is poor, and my relative. So I am sure
you will not be offended when for the future I give him the whole of
the legal work I used to give to you. You see, after all (as you
explained to me just now), it is purely a matter of business!

AS IT IS, AND—AS IT OUGHT TO BE.
A Legal Tragi-Comedy in a Prologue and one short Act.
Prologue.
Scene—Inner Sanctum in the Offices of an old-established Firm of
respectable Solicitors doing a very large leading business. Bland
Head of Firm discovered surrounded by all the outward signs
of well-sustained and successful litigation. Enter a Raving
Influential Client in tatters, off his head with worry, grief, and
disappointment, carrying a carpet-bag.
Bland Head of Firm {placidly). Ha! Mr. Boldotek! here again,
and so soon? Well, my dear Sir, pray what can we do for you now?
Raving Influential Client {with a cry of frenzy). What can you
do for me now? Ha! ha! ha! I '11 soon let you know. Look at
that! {Opens carpet-bag, and empties a pile of writs, summonses,
and other aggressive legal instruments on to the table.) And that isn't
all. I was pursued here by Bailiffs! {Rushes to the window.) See!
There are fifteen of them even now lurking hidden among the
scanty-leaved evergreens of the Square, ready to pounce out on me
the moment I set my foot on the other side of this accursed
threshold! [Falls backward into a waste-paper basket in a fit.
Bland Head of Firm {surveying him reflectively). And yet we not
only advised him wisely, but after a few appeals got him his verdict.
Surely he ought to be a thoroughly satisfied if not a solvent man.
Raving Influential Client {in an interval of consciousness—wildly).
Tell me, fiend in human Bhape—for being my Solicitor you are a fiend
in human shape—how it comes that once being wealthy and a man of
substance I have come to this! [Displays his tatters.
Bland Head of Firm. My dear Sir, it is obvious. Tl ou felt it was
necessary, in the face of a grave civil injury, to have recourse to the
protection of your country's law,—nay, we, a little interested in
making something out of you, advised you to such a course,—and
you are, as a natural consequence of taking that advice, after being
harassed by the requisite litigation, landed safely in the gutter a
beggared and broken man.
Raving Influential Client. And I was in easy circumstances! Is
justice then in England a luxury that means ruin even to the rich?
Bland Head of Firm. It is!
Raving Influential Client {springing out of the waste-paper basket
with a yell). Then, tell me—social leech,—the poor, who can not
afford to refresh and to retain Counsel and feed the crew of sharks
and harpies who live by the organised system of robbery that exists
in this country under the name of legal prooedure,—they can have
no justice at all!
Bland Head of Firm. None, my dear Sir, whatever!
Raving Influential Client (going mad). None! Ha! ha! Ho! ho!
Then three cheers for a pauper—and here goes for the'fifteen Bailiffs.
But, mark me—{jumping out of window)—a day will come!
Bland Head of Firm {smiling pleasantly, as he descends). Indeed?
I doubt it! But now tosell up the Duke.
[Strikes a silver bell, as the Curtain falls.
A hundred years are supposed to have elapsed.
The Scene represents the Official Room in the Government Advising
Solicitor s Office. Advising Solicitor discovered at his post hear-
ing cases. Enter a Publio Client.
Advising Solicitor {disposing of last applicant for advice). And now,
please, will you state your case as briefly and concisely as possible'(
Public Client. Certainly. My next-door neighbour started a steam
dynamo, and the action shaking down my chimney-pots through the
roof on to my children's heads in the nursery, I remonstrated. He
then, annoyed at my interference, blew up his boiler, and drove my
drawing-room wall by the force of the explosion clean into the
study of the house on the farther side. Remonstrating again, and
finding it useless, I then took the law into my own hands, and
retaliated by letting off expensive fireworks all night among the
orchids in his conservatory. He then asked me for damages, which
I declined, upon which ho called for an explanation. Treating this
as a forcible entry, I had him thrown back into his own premises over
the garden wall. The next day he replied by waiting till I came out
and hitting me over the head with a heavy banjo, and on my taking him
up and placing him in his own cistern, he followed me downstairs,
and broke my arm with a blow from the umbrella-stand. In the
evening I removed his area-palings and threw empty stout-bottles
at him whenever I got a chance. Upon this he has this evening
written to a local paper and libelled me by acousing me of murder,
and has, moreover, hired a permanent German band of three to play
all night and day inside my nouse whenever the street-door is opened.
Under these circumstances, I have thought it better to go to law, but,
as I have two hundred and seventeen witnesses and the case is some-
what involved, I am afraid it will be very protracted and expensive.
Advising Solicitor. Not in the least. Merely the usual fees. It
will cost you £1 1«. 9d. That is fifteen shillings for the Judge who
hears the case, five for the Government lawyer told off to take it up
for you, ninepence for the usher, and one shilling for myself.
Public Client. Dear me, that is really very moderate, tut I haven't
a halfpenny to pay it with.
Advising Solicitor. Indeed! then all you have to do is to fill up
this {gives him a form) and it will be charged to the rates.
Public Client. Capital! But I suppose, being a complicated case,
it will not come on for some months r
Advising Solicitor. On the contrary, it will be settled by to-
morrow afternoon.
Public Client (brightly). Thanks. Ha! They manage things now
better than they did ODe hundred years ago!
Advising Solicitor. Really? You don't say sol

Symbols of Scienoe are a joy for ever.
Their pregnancy increases, they shall never
Pass into prettiness, but still will keep
Their hideousness whether we wake or sleep.
They haunt our dreams, like nightmares check our
breathing,
Dull fancy which, with fine fantastic wreathing,
Of flowery whims would beautify the earth,
Spite of bad climate, of the man-caused dearth
Of Nature's gifts, of London's gloomy days,
Of the mud-cumbered and fog-darkened ways
Made for our plodding in; but spite of all
Symbols of Science shall retain the pall
On our dark spirits. Such, in glare of June,
The Railway Station, a most blessed boon
For simple folk; and suoh are monster bills
And the blank walls they sprawl on; the sharp shrills
Of railway whistles, and. the row they make
With Bnorting steam and the continuous brake;
The girder-bridges and the bald blank domes,
And belching blow-holes. Oh, not all the tomes
Of doctrine written by the pious dead,
All creeds that we have ever heard or read.
So nourish " faith " as gloom, and row, and stink—
At least so Scienoe hints. What do you think?

THE ACTRESS AND HER SUITORS.
Dear Mr. Punch,—There is not the least particle of truth in the
rumour that Miss Mary Anderson is about to be married to Mr.
Gladstone, the Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Robert Peel,
the Governor of the Bank of England, Lord Wolseley, Lord Ten-
nyson, the Master of Balliol, Lord Randolph Churchill, Colonel
Fred Burnaby, Mr. J. L. Toole, the Lord Chamberlain, Marquis
of Bute, the President of the College of Surgeons, Mr. Labouchere,
Captain Burton, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Mayor,
Baron Rothschild, Lord Henry Lennox, Mr. Spurqeon, Mr.
Montagu Williams, Mr. Marriott, Sir Frederick Leighton, or
the Maharajah Duleep Singh. I must beg you at onoe to deny all
or any of these rumours which have, in some unaccountable fashion,
gained currenoy. I happen to know that many of the above-
mentioned are married men,—and so their pretensions are out of the
question; and, moreover, I also happen to know that the accom-
plished American Actress has long been engaged to yours most
faithfully, The 0nit 0ne She Ever Loved.
Dubious.—Of course we mustn't say anything pendente lite, but we
cannot help calling the attention of our readers to Lord Coleridge's
statement, as reported in the Pall Mall Gazette last Friday, when,
"On their Lordships taking their seats, the Lord Chief Justice said :—11
am sorry to be obliged to say that the Court is not in a condition to-day to
pass sentence in this case.'"
What did this mean? The Court " not in a condition to pass sen-
tence" I As tine song has it, "So early in the morning!"
The East wind has been cruelly bad during the last part of Lent,
but what will it be when it's Easter!!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DOING THE STUDIOS.
[Our Extra-Special "Nibbs" sends us the following account of Ms
praiseworthy endeavours to anticipate all other Journalists in their
"Sounds of the Studios.")
Where Art, where Royal Aoademical Art is concerned, I
wouldn't be behind-hand—no, not for worlds. Wait for Show
Sunday, indeed! Wait for the
crowd which makes the airiest
studio stuffy, so that with a
headache I remember the day as
®\J»L the Qu'il fait Show Sunday!
Not for Nibbs! So, determined
to be first in the field of Litera-
ture and Art, I went a round of
the Studios on my own day,—
for I have a day in the week all
to myself, though it has not as
yet been mentioned in the
Calendar.
I wanted to take the Artists
by surprise. If they expect a
distinguished visitor, they can't
help posing, it's in their
artistic nature. They can't
help assuming a sort of a
nonchalant, easy, careless,
smoking-coaty, happy-go-lucky
air, as much as to say, Paint-
ing a trouble! not a bit! at
least, not to a Genius, you know.
Lor bless you! I just knock off these little canvasses 86 x 94,

longa!" exclaims John Everett Millais, R.A. "Pooh! 'Art
brevis—price longer,'—that's the true reading nowadays," and
mighty angry is he with the Government for having retracted the
offer of a reward for Osman Diqna's head.
"Why," says John Everett Millais, "I'd ha' gone out to the
Soudan, wherever that may be,—I don t know much about these
places,—and have taken old Osman's head with pleasure, if the Gov-
ernment had only put a good price on it. Not under three 'thou,'
my boy, money down, travelling expenses included."
He didn't expect me, and when I had rushed past the servant, who,
thinking I was the water-rate and gas collector, or the tax-gatherer,
nearly fainted in the hall while I bounded up the stairs to the
studio, and looked in from behind the curtain, I found John Everett
Millais hard at work, with his nose down to the picture, and groan-
ing and sighing as if he were cussing the day on which he had taken
to Art. Then, when I said " Booh! suddenly, he gave such a start,
that bang went the brush on to the canvass with a splotch, and out
went the eye of a portrait that had taken him many weary weary
months to get anything like right.
"How you startled me!" stammered the great Post-Raffaelite.
"I—I—I— didn't, you see,—ex—ex—pect you—and ha! ha!—
I'm not quite "and he looked round in vain for his pipe, and his
artistically daubed old easy coat. But unable to find his regular
studio properties, he vainly attempted to assume his usual oheery,
hearty, anyhow-take-it-or-leave-it-you-know manner.
"Found you in.'" I cried, with an emphasis on the last word
which conveyed my meaning perfectly.
"I '11 show you my Pictures, if you please, Sir," said John
Everett Millais, humbly. "But don't—don't tell what they are,
and I '11 give you one of them to take away with you."
I was not to be bribed. I gave a look round. "Come!" I said,
"show me your chef-d'eeuvre. Out with it!"
"Well, I was on it when you came in," he explained; "but you
made me put his eye out, and—and—I shall never get it done in
time." And here he broke down, and sobbed like a child.
"Bah!" I exolaimed, "give me the dagger!—I mean the brush."
And then approaching the picture But here I pause. I own I
was deeply affected by that grand work of Art, even with the eye
out. It was life-like. "You've only dotted an eye," I observed
pleasantly. "And," I added, as with a whisk of the dry brush (a
trick unknown to English Artists, but which I had learnt in the
studio of old Gammonio de Spinaccio in my Roman student days), I
removed the splotch and unoovered the damaged eye, "as you hadn't
got this quite right"
"I see I" he cried, with all the rapture of veritable inspiration,
"I see! Only leave me alone with it, and call again in another hour.
Genius can take a hint"
"And give one," I observed with that innate modesty which alone
is true nobility. "I will call in again about luncheon-time, and
mind you have it finished by then. Don't trouble yourself to come
to the door. I know my way about."
The maid, pale and scared, was in the halL As the door banged
behind mo, I fancied I heard a muttered threat, a tearful apology,
and a month's notice. But as it occurred to me that I should be
looking in there again at luncheon-time, I did not turn back to
explain. I had forgotten to take Notes of the Pictures. But this
was a detail.
Thence to High Art Row, the residence of J. C. Horslet, R.A. It
was formerly an old monastery, and has never been restored,—at
least not to the people to whom it originally belonged. Of oourse it
has been renovated; but the old hinges, the old iron chains, the old
Caen stone and thirteenth century bricks are as they were left by
the last old Prior, who was known as 'Prior to the Reformation.'
The ancient postern-gate was formidably barred and bolted, and, by
an odd coincidence, the bell sounded one,—the universal luncheon-
hour,—just as I surveyed the grill, the sight of which, from the
associations conjured up by its name, I own made me feel decidedly
hungry.
Above the 'doorway are curious slits in the wall, through which
the defenders of the castle (before it became a monastery) used to
pour down molten lead on visitors' heads, which was one of the prac-
tical jokes of the period when our land was known as "Merrie
England." Through these slits I fancy I was being " observed," as
they say on the Stage, because I had to ring three times before any-
one answered the summons, and then the door wasn't unbarred, but
only the little wicket was opened, and somebody's nose (most myste-
rious this! and a good title for a Christmas tale of horror,—Some-
body's Nose.') appeared at the grill.
It was a nose with a cold too,—a violent cold,—as, after the tip
had been exposed to the air for half a second, it had to be withdrawn
and blown.
"A game of ' tip and run,' " I said, cheerily, supposing it to be my
old friend J. C. Horslet, R.A., at the wicket.
"What do you want?" asked a gruff voice, which at the moment
I did not recognise.
"To see your pictures," I replied.
"Can't be done," answered the voice most unmusically, though it
was speaking through several bars. "Ain't got none. Not at
home.
"But," I expostulated, "who is it speaking—Horslet?"
"Speaking hoarsely !" retorted the gruff voice, "so would you if
you had such a beastly cold as I've got," and the wicket was slammed
violently in my face, just as the speaker seemed to be succumbing
to a fearful paroxysm of coughing.
"He must have mistaken me for somebody else," I argued with
myself, as I took my way to Sir F. Leighton's.
"Is Sir Frederick the Great at home?" I inquired pleasantly
of the Grecian Butler who guards the first portico.
"No, Sir Frederick is not."
"Not to me.'" I exclaimed.
"Not to you," was the rejoinder.
I was staggered; but just at that moment the sound of a familiar
voice, rising and falling in measured cadence like the soothing mono-
tone of the poluphoisbuoyant sea, fell on my ears as it was borne
towards me by the waves of sound, over the sands of time, from some
inner sanctum, and these words were distinctly audible: "Your
Imperial Majesty, your Royal Highnesses, your Serene Transparencies,
your Excellencies, my Lords, and Gentlemen,—It would Ul become
me whom the rioh afterglow of a manysided idyllio banquet and the
unyielding strength of the superfluous Bacchus delight [cheers), to
dilate on the "And here the voice died away, and once more
I found myself alone with the Grecian Butler, who was now in an
attitude of rapt ecstasy under the first portico.
"I will not disturb Sir Frederick," I murmured, in a whisper.
"I know he is practising his speech for the Academy Banquet, and
if he is not a quick study, the five weeks he has got before him to
do it in will have passed before he has mastered the sentiments
for the third toast."
So I noiselessly withdrew. The fragrance of the myrtle and
orange groves with whioh Sir Frederick s house is surrounded had
increased my appetite to a considerable extent, and I was therefore
not ill-pleased at remembering that a short walk would bring me to
the residence of Mr. Val Prinsep, A.R.A., whose hospitable door
was open, and a coloured servant was at the moment taking in several
packages of evidently very good things, all covered up, whioh were
being handed out of a confectioner's cart.
"Aha! " I exclaimed, cheerily, "just in time, eh?" and nodding
to the Retired Maharajah, who gave up a kingdom and any amount
of loot to come and serve " Sahib Val," and whose devoted attach-
ment is the theme of many a curious and interesting story, I was
about to divest myself of my shoes (a custom on which the retired
Indian Potentate still insists as a mark of doing reverence to "Sahib
Val"), when the faithful creature—who must have a very bad
memory for faces, as I've been there any number of times before—
suddenly barred my passage,—or rather Val's passage,—and placing

his hand on a jewelled dagger, whioh the Artist still allows him to
wear in his belt (a great pity, /think, as if he loses his temper he is
decidedly dangerous), he uttered some words in his native tongue
which, though I have not spoken Hindustanee for years, I immediately
understood to mean that his master was not at home to anyone."
"Not to me ?" I protested.
No; the Sahib was not even in to me. The Sahib was busy.
"Is he giving a party t " I inquired, carrying on the conversation
in his own language, which returned to me quite easily after the
first minute or so.
No; the Sahib was not giving a party. He was tasting cake-
samples from Bridgeman's.
The truth flashed across me. What I had seen announced in the
Spers was true! I should have liked to assist him, but the Ex-
aharajah was inexorable, and so was Bridgeman's man, who
refused to let me see even one of the sugar ornaments.
Just then the tom-tom sounded.
"I must gOj and so must you," the Maharajah said, sternly, show-
ing his gleaming teeth, and half-drawing his dagger, as, pointing
towards the door, he stamped thrice with his foot, and from behind
some low arabesque work, where he had been concealed, there crawled
forth a small Dwarf Snake-Charmer, accompanied by several of his
favourite reptiles, all alive-oh, and made towards me.
The Exiled Maharajah had disappeared, and so had Bridgeman's
man, and as 1 had never met the Dwarf Snake-Charmer before, I
thought it more prudent to bow as politely as was possible under
the oiroumstances and retire, but not before my sharp eye had
detected a small triangular packet, whioh my hand was quick enough
to seize. It was cake—real wedding cake! and oddly enough
wrapped up in a page of the Aoademy Catalogue for 1883, and, while
eating the cake, and wishing my old friend health and happiness, I
ran my eye over the list of last year's pictures, among whioh. I found
"No. 414. 'Returning after the Honeymoon.' Val Prinsep,
A.R.A."
All wedding cake and no wine makes Jack Nibbs a dry boy, and
the question was where should I go for the necessary refreshment.
"Let me see," I said to myBelf. I must have several artistic
friends within a stone's throw" the expression was an inspira-
tion, for it suddenly occurred to me that Marcus Stone's, A.R.A.,
was just round the comer,—the very corner-stone, in fact, on which
I would build my hopes.
To arrive at his door and ring the bell was the work of a moment.
To get the bell answered was the work of some minutes, during which
time I deliberated within myself whether it wouldn't be as well to
announce myself under a feigned name (to take him all the more by
surprise), and not to run any risk of a refusal this time,—(for a
true Artist scents the Critic afar off, and cries "Aha!")—and so
when the door was opened by a comely maiden, in the costume of
Marie Antoinette, I said, without inquiry for Mr. Marcus Stone,
"My timmer-madchen, in me you zee a Burchaser of Bictures.
Behold—I come to zee ze works of ze Great Master MarcuSj wiz one,
doo, dree towsand Bound in my Booket!" And immediately she
showed me upstairs to the studio, \ As I asoended that staircase,
there went up with me a sweet savour from either the kitchen or
the dining-room, and—I regretted that piece of cake.
I wished I had not touched it—I wished I had not eaten it at all.
I was wishing I had never seen it—when, suddenly—the whole studio
seemed to swim round—and in another moment I should have fallen
on the floor but for a friendly chair, on which I sank, only to be
fetched up again by a loud shout from a familiar voice, Take care,
old chap, you 're sitting on my palette!"
«•••••
They sent for a cab. On reaching: home I sent for a doctor. The
attack was inexplicable until I heard that an Indian had been to my
rooms, anxiously inquiring about a piece of cake which had been
intended and carefully prepared for the Snakes, whose doom had been
sealed that morning. The Ex-Maharajah brought an antidote with
him, and at the same time, to make up for your disappointment in
not receiving from me all the information I had intended to obtain,
I forward you a few particulars, for the correctness of which I could,
if necessary, vouch with my life, and, what is dearer to me than life,
my honour. Here, then, are my
STORIES FROM THE STUDIOS.
Mr. Alma-Tadema, II.k., is at work on a classic subject, to be
entitled "/ dreamt that I dwelt in Marble Halls." The smooth
polished floor and pillars are absolutely perfect. I hope he will have
it ready in time.
Miss Clara Montalba has hit on a really original subject. It is
a view of St. Mark's, Venice, as seen from the left-hand corner of
the Piazza, just five minutes after sunrise. One of the celebrated
Pigeons is picking up the early worm.
Mr. Boughton, A.R.A., sends a "single figure,"—for which
he asks three figures, and it's well worth it.
Mr. J. Sant, K.A.. has gone out of his line to draw what he has
been pleased to call " Speaking Dolls; or, Studies from the Lowther
Arcade."
rage
•de." I fancy these will be a great success, and should encou-
the Artist to persevere in this new departure."
Mr. F. Goodall, R.A., has also ventured on entirely new ground.
It is an Eastern subject, and is entitled "Egyptian Boy and
Mummy."
T. Faed, R.A., sends "The Town Crier"—& most pathetic
picture.
Mr. Hook, R.A., is quite right to stick to the sea. His new work,
"The Portraits of Two Buoys," will be the hit of the year.
E. J. Pointer, R.A., contributes a Roman Banker in the time of
CAS8TU8.
Mrs. Kate Perugini sends two pictures. One entitled " A Seal
Screamer.'" is a charming portrait of a little child. As a study of
repose and still life, admirable. The other is also a touching picture,
with a deep moral underlyingthe simple pathos of the situation. It
is an infant, heavily asleep in a cradle, and out of its hand has
tumbled on empty bottle. Mrs. Perugini has called this "Beginning
Early."
Animals in the Desert, stopping at a half-way house for refresh-
ment is by Briton Riviere, R.A., who calls it Lions Inn."
I congratulate Mr. A. Storey, A.R.A., on a novelty. Instead of
Cathedral interiors and endless architectural perspectives, he has
thrown his whole soul into a single figure of a girl (she won't long
remain single), which he has entitled Little Poppit; or, The Pawn-
broker's Daughter."
Mr. Marks, R.H., sends "Antiquarians in Cheshire, or Mite is
Bight." It represents two old gentlemen engaged on an old cheese.
The oheese lacks finish; still it is strong.
The subject chosen by Mr. Marcus Stone, A.R.A., has all the real
oharm of novelty. An old man in the costume of 1780, a young girl,
an open letter, an old wall, sunlight effect on trees. Title Will
Set" It tells its own story.
Sir F. Leighton, P.R.A., sends a mythological subject several
sizes larger than life, which I hear will have to be reduced by pho-
tography before it can be got out of bis house,—unless the entire roof
is taken off and one side pulled down,—and will then be re-enlarged
by some new process before being placed in its position in Burlington
House, where it will receive the last touches of the master hand. It
is entitled " Jupiter Creating a Precedent." It is in Sir Frederick's
best style.
R. Ansdell, R.A., goes in for High Art. Brace and a half of
grouse, which have been shot by accident and left on the moors for
some days. The de-composition of this picture is marvellous. The
Artist names it " The Same Old Gamer
Sir John Gilbert, R.A., has, for a change, chosen a mediaeval
subject. It is oalled "Hot Work, or, The Shortest Knight in
Armour," June 21st, 1403.
Mr. Frith", R.A., "Much Ado about Charles the First meeting
Dr. Johnson for the first time at the Academy Banquet in White-
hall." The figures are all portraits. The moment selected is when
the great lexicographer was introduced to Charles, who, on being
told it was Johnson, replied incredulously, "Johnson! 0
Walker!"
I have nothing more to add, but I think you will find that the
first, best, and most complete information is furnished to you by your
real old friend and invaluable Contributor Nebbs.

The inventor of the New Apparatus for Saving Life at Sea has
wisely admitted that it is not absolutely perfeot, out requires modi-

tion is undeniably right, though, as some little difficulty lies " in the
application on it, a few details will have to be re-arranged, and the
balance neatly adjusted. When this is done, the apparatus, no altera-
tion having been mode in its material substance, will float on any
sea, and Skippers first, then shippers afterwards, will bless the name
of "Partner Joe."

THE REAL PARLIAMENTARY
WHIP.
John Bull, loquitur:—
Patience? In face of long continued shame
Patience becomes dishonourably tame,
And wrath a simple duty! I '11 not pale
Expostulations meek; 'tis mine to rule,
When rulers of my own appointing fail,
And in the face of faction power gTows pale,
Halts oripplewise, or blindly stumbles on,
All purpose palsied, and all compass gone!
These bogglers shame me. I am siok at soul!
How if Leviathan amidst a shoal
Of minnows flounders hopelessly inert P
What boot the forces he can not exert P
Parliament P Pooh! A scene of aimless noise,
A show of senile dolts and wrangling boys!
Where Chatham swayed, where fulminated
Busks.
A little lordling, with complacent smirk
Or histrionic scowl, consumes the hours
With faroe or melodrama. Danger lours,
Or business long-delayed attention claims f
What matter? Fact ion's lit tie bouI, in flames
With office-grubbing greed, its power must
strain
To snatch by trick some petty party gain.
Fanatic fad, still ready to upset
The Solar System in the hope to get
Its little whim well launched, uplifts its bray
Like panniered Issochar and blocks the way.
They're wrong all round, and since self-
righting seems
The fondest and unlikeliest of dreams,
My hand must intervene. Think they per
chance
That I have watched their motley Morris-dance
Of loud nnrule and vulgar violence,
Empty of chivalry and void of sense,
With tolerant eyes f I tell them, not at all!
They 're wrong all round, and now my lash
shall fall
On all impartially. Eternal clack
In vain would cover the continual lack
Of still and steadfast wisdom. Talk! talk!
talk!
The floods that laid the sandstone or the chalk,
Held for each drop its atom, but this void
Long wash of words is mischief unalloyed,
Just iridescent slush, foredoomed to pass
To sun-dried flats or end in mere morass;
Let the firm land of purpose once appear
From out the watery waste; the tickled ear
Of adulation stint of " eloquence,"
An e'en Obstruction, robbed of one pretence,
Will limp and languish.
As for that black pest,
That Protean plague, with what amazing zest
I '11 lay the lash upon its callous hide!
I used to think that with an equal pride
I might survey the Ins and Outs; but then
Both sides were patriots and were gentlemen,
Opposed as equal fairly fighting foes,
And not as low attorneys or bravos.
They've changed all that! Obstruction's
fatal touch
Contaminating all, has proved too much
For manners, manhood, magnanimity,
All laws of the unwritten chivalry
Of brave opponents in the civic lists.
Unfair advantages, malicious twists,
The conscious sly insinuated lie,
Webbed with some veil of specious sophistry;
The spurious wrath and simulated scorn,—
These are their weapons! Is it to be borne P
Who first rebels P The well-graced scholar
bland P
The high blue-blooded magnate of the land P
The Pnnce of Commerce, or the slip of Rank P
Not they! Good humour winks at Puofc-like
?rank,
oxy trick, small malice, manners bad,
And all the coarse equipment of the Cad,
Shame him who'll use them, whether Irish
churl
Or " noble" would-be-ape of the Great Earl.
Shame on them all! As voluble as daws,
Aimlessly noisy as an ass's jaws!
The cackling Chief, the "Leader" who's so
weak
As to be led by cool and callow cheek
To wink at the dishonour of delay,
And mutely favour what he dare not say;
The statesman soured by shelving, whose
shrill spite
With "candid" flouts prolongs the wordy
fight;
The posing patriot with his foolish flow
Of muddled mock-heroics; the smart beau,
Self-deemed a Cincinnatus, prosing long
Of sham dishonour and fictitious wrong;
The crotcheteer where jibbing '1 conscience"
spends
Its heartiest kicks upon embarrassed friends:
The Cynio who, when age long toil would
crown,
To shift a brick would bring the building
down;

A DRAMATIC SCHOOL TREAT.
A triumph has at last been achieved by the School of Dramatic
Art. At a recent performance, for the benefit of that Establishment,
of a new Play by Mr. Palgrave Simpson, founded upon Bleak
House, a Miss Dobotht Dens, a young Lady described by a con-
temporary as " a pupil,"—it does not say whether she is the sole pupil
on the books,—appeared in the part of Hester Summerson with
marked success. She displayed, continues the approving Critio,
referring to the educational advantages of the Dramatic School,
"qualities reflecting much credit on that Institution;" and as if to
emphasise their quite exceptional character, he adds that "to the
charm of a pretty face and lissom figure,"—valuable accomplish-
ments, by the way, and reflectinir the highest credit on the curricu-
lum,—" a knowledge of the requirements of the Stage such as has
usually to be gained by experience."
It was only natural that after such a signally successful and
almost unexpected issue to the combined and protraoted efforts of
all the earnest patrons, vice-presidents, noblemen, professors, officers
of the general Staff, well-wishers, acrobats, popular lecturers, and
others who have had the interests of the cheery little struggling con-
cern so much at heart, they should meet to celebrate what might be
regarded as the culling of the first ripe fruit of their united and
assiduous labours; and at the last usual monthly meeting of the
Council it was at onoe proposed that the matter should be made the
subject of some official and congratulatory notice.
The motion being agreed to without any very disagreeable or serious
discussion, the Regius Professor of Construction, Dr. Palgrave
Simpson, D.A.S., and Official Adapter-General to the Institution,
whose clever Drama had played such an important part on the occa-
sion, was voted into the Chair, and proceeded, amidst deafening
cheers, which lasted some minutes, and were with difficulty sup-
pressed, in a few brief words to address the meeting.
He said: He thanked them all for that manifestation of feeling,
on which he could only put but one construction, and that was, that
whatever he had done to Bleak House, it was quite clear the Council
didn't think he had brought the interests of the Institution to a
Dead-lock. (Roars of laughter.) He put the best construction on
those jeers. Indeed, his whole life had been spent in putting the
best construction he could upon everything he could lay hands upon.
{Renewed laughter.) He would instance the present play as a case in
point. He had looked carefully [at Bleak House, and, being con-
vinced that, situated as it was, it was bound to suffer from a frost,
what had he done? Why, he had pulled it down, and reconstructed
it altogether. Yet it had bothered nim not a little. He did not see
bis way at first to getting rid of Tulkinghom. Yet he had said to
himself, " Tulkinahorn must be killed by hook or by crook!" Then
the happy thought struck him, "Why not by Krookt" His
auditors Knew the rest. They had seen how admirably he had been
assisted by the representative of the character, Mr. H. Campbell.
But for the skill of that clever Actor, it would have been quite
impossible for him to have introduced the great feature in Krook's
part—the spontaneous combustion. Many an Actor can make
an effective exit, but it wants a very subtle acquaintance with
Stage-business indeed to enable him "go off" in sight of
the whole audience. {Cheers.) Indeed, ne might say with
truth that no Actor could do this even once without being
a thoroughly finished Artist. Yet, Mr. H. Campbell had
accomplished it with "a realism," as a contemporary grimly
remarked, "that could not well have been surpassed." {Loud
laughter.) The only puzzle to him now was how to reconstruct Mr.
H. Campbell. Li Voice—" You '11 do it! ") He believed he oould.
{Cheers.) Still, he did not ignore the difficulties that beset the path
of a dramatic Author. He nad no doubt that in giving a proper
Stage-shape to Martin Chuzzlewit, for instance, he should find it
necessary to cut out that personage himself entirely from the cast,
and making Pecksniff the hero, let him ultimately be shot by Mrs.
Gamp. He mentioned no names, but he trusted that with this little
change effected in the story, a distinguished and accomplished Lady
Amateur might be disposed, to look not unfavourably at the part.
('1 Hear.'") He also had hopes]of putting one or two more of Dickens's
useful novels into "adapted" shape, and he conceived that two
or even three might be rolled into one, if necessary. It was
merely a question of cast. For the matter of that, if a theatre had
a oompany of heavy salaries who could play the parts, why should
not Dombey, Mr. Squeers, and Fagin all figure in the self-same
piece? They might be brothers {"Hear!") they might be cousins
—they might be anything. (Cheers.) What did it matter as long as
they were all got in and provided with a good situation a-piece?
That was the constructor's real business—to act like the proprietor
of a registry office for servants and be continually providing every-
body with good situations. {"Hear!") Sometimes a single Actor
wanted several for himself, and then, in making the play, he, the
learned Professor, found it necessary to ask that Aotor how long it
was since he left his last situation, and then provide him instantly
with another. Indeed, it was a long familiarity with such a system
that had enabled him to collaborate in the production of his celebrated
All for Him! {Loud cheers.) And after that remark he_ thought he
could not better conclude his observations than by expressing a fervent
wish that their graceful and accomplished pupil, who had made so
satisfactory a first appearance, might find her well-deserved success
result in a decided and substantial Haul for Her!
The speech of the learned Professor was received with enthusiastic
cheering, and he was about to resume his seat, when it being
intimated that a strange Lady and Gentleman were waiting outside
in the hall with a youthful pupil, and had asked for a Prospectus of
the School Fees, the Meeting, after a hurried vote of thanks to the
Chairman, hastily adjourned and rushed out to see what was up.
CALLED BACK AND PULLED UP.
The English Illustrated Magazine, published by Macmellan, is
well worth two sixpences instead of one, if only for its admirable
engravings. Excellent is the spirited account given by Mr. Archi-
bald Forbes in this number of "How I Became a War Correspon-
dent." But Mr. Hugh Conway, merely because he has done one
WiUrie-Collins-cum-Le-Fanu like book, Called Back, should not
trade upon this, and pose as a literary Fat Boy who "wants to make
your flesh creep," and write such rubbish as Paul Vargas, a Mystery.
—the sort of story that any one who has once gone in for this kind of
thing could run off the reel by the yard. Mr. Vice-Versa-Anstey-
Guthrie made the same sort of firework success, followed by similar
mistakes. Everything else is bright and artistic in Macmlllan's
English Illustrated for April, but this one story—which is a Mac-
Millancholy mistake. Why, the weakest of Mrs. Riddell's Weird
Stories is worth a dozen of Paul Vargas.
If Mr. Hugh Conway had called it " A Sell" instead of " A Mys-
tery" Stay! is that what he meant, after all? If so, as a prac-
tical joke, he has succeeded. But the experiment is dangerous, as
when a Magazine is taken in by the Publio, the Public doesn't like
being taken in by a Magazine,—not even by one writer in it.
By the way, Mr. James Payn's Literary Recollections, in the
Cornhill, are very amusing. But the Giant's Robe is too long, drags,
and wants cutting—or, being a robe, perhaps it only requires a little
trimming.
Redistribution of Seats.
On the pests who use seats in the House to brew storms,
Mr. Punch would inflict a sharp sentence;
All Members who make a bad use of its " forms,"
Should be shunted to Stools—of repentance!
Shakespeariana.—We read in the paper that at the Southwark
Polioe-Court the other day—
"William Shakespeare, 65, a tall, powerful-looking man, was placed
at the bar, before Mr. Bridob, charged with being drunk and riotous in
Meadow Row, New Kent Road, and assaulting Geohob Ho wen , 174 M, and
Henky Fitzgeuald, 154 M, in the execution of their duty."
We have heard of a certain Mr. William Shakespeare who wrote
Comedies and Tragedies, and who did not always behave himself as
well as he should. In fact at one time he was in the hands of
keepers,—not as a lunatic, but as a poacher. Possibly the Gentleman
above-mentioned is a descendant. Why did not some enterprising
Manager secure him, get him to write a Tragedy, and advertise an
"entirely new play by William Shakspeare "? What an attraction,
too, he might have been at the Shakspearian Show at the Albert Hall
in May! Unfortunately he found "the quality of Mercy is not
strained" at the Southwark Police-Court, even for William
Snakespearb, for Mr. Bridge was inconsiderate enough to sentence
him to six months' hard labour. We commend him to the attention
of the Shakspearian Society when he comes out.

SSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, March '24.—Debate on Fran-
chise Bill opened by Lord John- Manners. Most ladylike speech.
Full of italics, notes of admiration, and several postscripts, con-
cluding by Greek quotation done into English, imploring House, if
they must kill him, might he ask that he should at least see his fate,
and die in the open face of day?
Lord Fitzmatjrice soothed to sleep by Mannebs's manner. Woke
up just in time to hear the peroration. Rising hurriedly, and rubbing
his eyes, he said, "Perhaps the Noble Lord will give notice of that
question."
John Bright sitting in old corner-seat below Gangway, ready for
another tussle with opponents of Parliamentary Reform. House
filled up to hear him. Curious to see him sitting there as nervous as
if the clock had been put back forty years, and he were about to
make maiden speech. Face flushed, lips dry, and hand fitfully
clutching at paper. Liberals gave him good hearty cheer when on
his legs. This seemed to do him good, but he faltered through open-
ing sentences. These bore directly upon Lord John's speech, and
proved to be the best part of his oration. On the whole, a woeful
falling off from old times. As positive as ever, but so pointless!
Once protested that he "could not turn his back on himself," but
goes back on himself in pitiful poverty-stricken way. The Cave,
long ago worn out, brought on Stage again; also the quotation from
himself about the alternative of Ireland being unmoored and set
again in the sea two thousand miles to Westward.
House listened respectfully but not without sorrowful disappoint-
ment, and as dinner-time oame, Members, whom Gladstone on same
subject held in thrall till the soup was cold and fish spoiled, openly
dropped off in twos and threes. Fact is, there is no fight in the
business. Conservatives don't dare meet Reform Bill with negative.
Go blowing on it harmless side wind that means nothing. House
naturally depressed on threshold of six nights' talk leading up to
inevitable and unalterable conclusion.
Best speech of night Jemmy Lowtheb's. James not to be tied
and bound down by political exigences. Never liked Reform.
Doesn't like it now, and no kicking-strap will keep his heels off the
splash-board. Having something definite to say, he says it; perhaps
not always accurately but vigorously, and with contagious cheerful-
ness. No racing in false colours for James. No pulling on the course.
He runs straight both at Newmarket and Westminster, and the
people he runs up against don't like him the less for it.
Business done.—First night's debate on Franchise Bill.
Tuesday.—Another day absolutely wasted. Randolph came up
fresh with old inquiry, "What's your policy in Egypt?" This
goes on till Five. Then Cattle Plague Bill on. Speeches made by
friends of the Bill up to almost last moment, when Joseph Gillis
stepped in, and blandly talked Bill out. Pretty plain to me country
won t stand this much longer. If House doesn't dissolve itself, will
be done for them. Shall have, instead of Pride's Purge, the People's
Purge. Been getting my Election Address ready. Here's the first
draft:—
"To the Electors of Barks.—Gentlemen, when I first solicited
your suffrages, I followed long-established usage, describing my
political principles and alluding to questions of the day. Bnt oter
long oter meree, as they say on le Continong. The old times when
the House of Commons was a political assembly governed by rules of
conduct acceptable among Gentlemen are gone by, and learn:'
cult ure, and eloquence are no longer of account. I move with
times, and I trust I shall feel equal to their present requirements.
"Whilst, Gentlemen, I therefore say nothing on political questions,
I assure you that my health is good, my voice unimpaired, and as to
considerations of what is due to public service and to the dignity of
the House, I have carefully eliminated them. I can sit up all night
without any refreshment save of a liquid nature, and I am good for
howling through the following day if necessary. I will make alliances
with any political party in the House in order to worry the Govern-
ment. I will load the paper with questions of which I am careful to
give oral notice, reading out every word. When a Minister answers,
I wrangle with him and finally give notice to repeat the question
on another day. All of which you will perceive takes up time and
prevents business being done. When a Bill is before the House on a
Wednesday, or at a Morning Sitting, and some hours' Debate has
taken place, I come in at the last moment and talk it out, causing the
whole sitting to go for nothing. I move the adjournment of the House
in order to ask the Government who is responsible for Osman Digna's
hair being cut. I bawl interruptions when Mr. Gladstone is on his
feet, which irritates him and leads to a scene.
"In short, whilst originally I went to Parliament to help to get busi-
ness done, I now ask vour suffrages in order that I may be returned
to prevent its accomplishment. What is now wanted as a proper
recommendation for a Member of Parliament is a cast-iron constitu-
tion and a thorough contempt for the old traditions of Parliamentary
life. These, Gentlemen, are mine, and I am yours to command,
"Tobt."
Fancy that '11 fetch 'em.
Wednesday.—Been quite in the nursery line to-day. Wabton
Sit on his Patent Medicines Bill, and Bbtce his Infants (in Arms)
ill. This last a useful practical measure, in striking contrast with
many crotchets House asked to consider. Clause One makes it a

misdemeanor to hold any infant in a position that would bring its
head where its feet ought to be. Clause Two regulates the heat of
the bath, and, read in conjunction with Clause Five, will reduce the
annual production; unhappily increasing, of parboiled infants.
Clause Three provides for damages in oases where children have
been (so-called) accidentally sat upon. Second Section of the Bill deals
with perambulator question: Provides that on fine Spring or Summer
days, when streets crowded, extra police (to be charged to the Rate-
payers) shall be engaged to clear way for perambulators. All
persons obstructing perambulators, or, in cases of previous convic-
tions, openly objecting to be run over, may be taken before nearest
Magistrates, and summarily dealt with.
Bill had very favourable reception. Ince moved rejection;
on other hand, Horace took his Davey in favour of it. Eminent
legal opinion being thus divided, paternal instinct prevailed, and
Second Reading carried by rattling majority. Business done.—
Infants Bill read a Second tune by 208 votes against 73.
Thursday.—" This is what the Marchioness would call 'a wonner
for Warton,' " said Captain O'Shay. Firth had called attention to
wholesale blocking of Bills by intelligent representative of Bridport.
Asked whether it was not wilful obstruction, Speaker could not
say it came within letter of Rule, but was distinct violation of its
spirit. Finished by throwing out broad hint to House to take the
matter in its own hands. Warton a little downcast.
"Cheer up, old man," said Labby. "You 're not at the end of
your tether. House may growl, but it won't bite. Haven't been
here so long as some people, but think I know the House pretty well.
In all things that concern its own procedure, it's the most timid old
woman in the world. There's not a Vestry in the kingdom would
stand you for a fortnight. You are an exceedingly stupid person,
vulgar in your manner, limited in your intelligence, neither good-
humoured nor good-natured. Yet here you've been Session after
Session sitting on the House like a nightmare, neither doing good
yourself, nor letting other people do good. House grumbles and
groans, protests its time's wasted, and that it's made the laughing-
stock of the country, and does nothing more. And it '11 go on doing
nothing more till palings are pulled down somewhere. Don't distress
yourself about to-night. You 're quite safe; much safer than the
prospects of public business."
More Debate on Franchise BiU. Lively speech from young George
Russell who has grit in him. Promising maiden oration from
Lowther, not "Jemmy," but James W. Raises gloomily vitriolic.
"Looks as if he had risen from the tomb to whack Gladstone on
the head and warn us against the Agricultural Labourer," said Har-
court, in carefully subdued aside.
For hour or two House empty. Thorold Rogers, moving softly
about in new pair of patent leather pumpB, whispers his latest
epigram by way of cheering depressed spirits of few Members present:
"What lawyers, and critics, and artists have felt,
Tour Coleridoes, Eussells, and Frosts,
Is that Lawes is a far better sculptor than Belt,
For he's chiselled him out of his costs."
Towards eleven o'clock, when we ought to be going home, having
done good night's work, Chamberlain appears. House filled up.
Soene grows lively. Chamberlain—" mildest-mannered man that
ever out a throat —plods pleasantly along, dropping little bits of hot
sealing-wax all over Conservative Benohes, which are in constant
commotion. "Like popped corn on the frying-pan," as Mr. Charles
Russell (who has been to America) observes.
Business done.—Further Debate on Franchise Bill.
Friday.—Sad news to-night. Young Albany's dead—dead ere
his prime. A blameless, kindly gentleman, with scholarly instincts
and a great desire to do his duty. Question whether House should
forthwith adjourn? No precedent found for such course. Ministers
wisely decline to make one. All very well to postpone festivities,
but House of Commons not a festive scene. So, having dried our
eyes, get to work again. Business done.—Farmer PEix'sLocal Tax-
ation Resolution carried against Government by 208 against 197.
Quite a little Surprise.—Last Friday, England was suddenly
informed by the Correspondents, who represent the Wise Men of the
East, that the War was over, and the troops were coming back. No
more flourish about the announcement than there would have been
had the troops gone out for a holiday, to a tea-fight, and were return-
ing the same evening. The War over? Dear me! is it, really?
What's the line in Tom Thumb f "Rebellion's dead! and now
we '11 go to breakfast!" But stop—isn't there someone still out there
in a difficulty? Oh, yes, Gordon—General Gordon. Ah—yes—of
course. Well, before this appears we shall probably have heard
something more about him, but—anyhow—the War s over; and
even if we are still fighting, still killing and being killed, yet we
have it on the best authority the War is over, and it's all right.
Ah! hum !—is it?
SOMETHING LIKE A PUNISHMENT!
(A Fragment from the Records of a Court.)
Cold and shivering, the poor creature was torn from her home!
A few hours before she had been warmly elad, and seated in front of
a bright and cheerful fire. What a contrast! A biting cruel wind—
her dress scarcely reaching to her neck, and certainly not covering
an inoh of arm!
Ah! she was too old for this cruelly! It would have tried the
strength of her youngest daughter, so it was too much for her with
her threescore years and more! Oh, the pity o' it, the pity o' it!
And she had led a comparatively blameless life. She was no
political prisoner, Bhe had been fairly just in all her dealings. Then
why drag her forth like this—half naked—to face the cruel blast of a
wintry forenoon?
But she had to face more than a wintry blast. For hours, as she
was carried to the House of Detention, she had to run the gauntlet
of a brutal mob thirsting to jeer at her wretchedness. A terrible
ordeal this! There she sat in ner vehicle of torture, while the very
scum of a mighty city made her a target for their brutal jests 1
And then, weary and sick at heart, she became hungry! But,
bound in many wrappings, she could not move. It was her part to
suffer the pains of semi-starvation!
At length the march of degradation was over! The vehicle had
rolled, step by step, yard by yard, through the mouthing mob until
it reached that gloomy pile which for a time was to become her
prison. Her progress had been slow, but now she was hustled out of
ner conveyance, and pushed, half fainting, up a flight of steps. She
noticed that she had many sister victims—some matrons like herself,
somo crones even older, some mere girls who had scarcely left the
nursery—and one and all were cold and browbeaten. They had no
strength left for resistance, and so yielded without a struggle to the
rough treatment of the red-coated official who received them.
Our victim entered the stone hall. After a pause in a side room,
where she was deprived of a poor oloak she had managed to fling
around her before she was driven from home, she was hurried up a
stone staircase lined with armed men, who roughly motioned her to
prooeed.
And now she found herself in a gloomy prison, guarded at its two
entrances by more armed men, who carried halberds, and seemed
prepared immediately to slaughter those from whom any kind of
opposition might be expected. The apartment which she now occu-
pied was full of fellow sufferers. The wind whistled through this
room mournfully. In the centre were a few chairs, which had been
fought for, and secured by the first-comers.
Hungry, cold, thirsty, and weary, our poor victim stood near a
window, waiting to see what next would happen. At a signal of the
armed men, the crowd of prisoners rushed, squabbling and pushing
amongst themselves, into a new apartment, similar in appearance to
the one they had just left. The moment they were all in, bars and
chains were put up to keep them safe. Again and again was this
change made, until at length our poor victim was nearly dead with
fatigue.
And now the moment of supreme torture had arrived. Encum-
bered by a heavy garment, which nearly tripped her up, she was
ordered to approach a group of gorgeously-attired strangers, who
seemed to regard her without a vestige of compassion. But this was
not enough. She was required to walk backwards! For a moment
she refused. But men with swords and spears were there to over-
come resistance! Broken down with hunger and fatigue, cold and
old and miserable, she

"But what is all this about?" interrupts the gentle Reader at
this point. "Is Mr. Punch giving some details about a case of
Venetian Torture in the olden time P"
"No," comes the answer. "Although the mistake is reasonable
enough, Mr. Punch is doing nothing of the sort. He is merely
recounting the adventures of a London Dowager attending a modern
Drawing Room!"
"Dear me!" exclaims the gentle Reader. "The sketch reads
more like the story of a visit to a prison than a sojourn in a palace!"
And Mr. Punch agrees with him!

FOR SOCIETY'S SAKE.—A Lady and Gentleman with a small,

COUPLE, on moderate terms. Near Holland Park.—Address, &c.
It suggests two people being utterly weary of one another, and
yearning for sensible society, when the honeymoon has waned. It
ought to have been made into a poem. Thus—
'Tis odd, when two people each other adore,
That each finds the other sometimes is a bore!
When very much married for better or worse,
To change for the better they 're seldom averse!
From honeymoon dreaming thej suddenly wake,
And welcome the world "for society's sake"!
We sometimes feel dull, so we 're willing to share
The mansion we 'vc furnished with taste and with care;
'Tis bright and 'tis pleasant, and near Holland Park,
Its aspect is cheerful from daylight to dark!
And a nice married couple we 're willing to take,
On moderate terms, "for society's sake!
If we have the luck, and we chance to entice
A couple to dwell in our sweet Paradise,
Its joys and its pleasures they '11 quickly restore,
When boredom and bliss are divided by four!
A moderate offer we 're willing to make,!
And sacrifice much " for society's sake ".!
Easteh Cards and Easter Egos.—Some beautiful specimens of
the latter from the nest of the Sparrow—no, Sparagnapane—have

THE SU11VIVAL OF THE FITTEST;
OR, SOMETHING L1KK A LANDLORD.
Time—Apud, 1081, a.d. Scene— The Library of the Marquis of
Swallowland. Present the Marquis and his Man of Business.
The table is strewn tcith Title-deeds, Maps, Charts, fyc.
Marquis ^complacently), Well, Moulteb, I fancy that at last we
are within sight of land!
Mr. Moulter. The metaphor, my Lord Marquis, is marked by
more than your accustomed felicity.
Marquis. Ahem! Quite so! I had not so considered it, hut with
our race fitness is an instinct. And you really think we shall bring
that stiff-necked Nail-man to his knees at last <
Mr. Moulter. Haven't a doubt of it, my Lord. He has long been
your onlv surviving rival. With the exception of his miserable twenty
thousand acres the whole land—and water, too, for that matter1—of
the United Kingdom has long been your private freehold.
Marquis {hotly). Yes! Just imagine!! A stubborn jumped-up
third descendant of a Brummagem tin-tack manufacturer contend
with Me for the monopoly of land-holding, and hinder by ten good
years the realisation of the Great Ideal!!!
Mr. Moulter. It is indeed an atrocity! When your Lordship's
grandfather first conceived the noble ambition of concentrating in the
possession of the head of his family the freehold of his Native Land,
it, like other Ideals, was laughed to scorn by the brawling levellers
of the time. Your respected progenitor argued thus: "The Land is
now the Monopoly of the Few. These blatant Socialistic agitators
aim at making it the common possession of the Many. I will render
it the Exclusive Privilege of the One!" The scientific theory of the
survival of the fittest bids fair to be vindicated in your person, my
Lord, by your Lordship's becoming that One!
Marquis. Ah, yes. It has been a tough fight, though, and even
now—-by the way, how has that Thames riparian question between
myself and the residents of Camfordham been decided?
Mr. Moulter. In your favour, my Lord. The riparian leaseholders
are—at their own expense, of course—to carry their grounds rightdown
to the river, and the public traffic will have to make a detour of a mile
and a quarter—for the present. We hope next year to exclude the
public from the left hank of the river for the whole thirteen miles
between Camfordham and Maplemead.
Marquis. That's right, Moulteb! The Public, as the levellers
vaguely call the tag-rag-and-bob-tail of the country, is getting too
bounceably exacting. Want to walk on the banks of my river where
and when they like; fish in its waters at their own sweet will; and
indulge in what they are pleased to call the "harmless recreation"
of boating and pic-nicing without restriction! Monstrous!
Mr. Moulter. It is, my Lord! The pettiest little suburban
villa-dweller, who'd howl himself apoplectic if he caught a strange
youngster angling in liis four-by-six fish-pond, will talk largely
about the "hardship" of not being made free of your eyots and
backwaters when he takes .his red-faced wife out for a Sunday
morning's gudgeon-fishing.
Marquis. Precisely! You—ah—really put these things very well,
Moulteb. You—ah!—should be in Parliament to—ah! defend the
Rights of Property, which very shortly, as you say, will be my
rights.
Mr. Moulter (effusively). Oh! my Lord —the honour — the
privilege of— ah!—defending
Marquis [indignantly). When men appeal—as some still do
appeal—(in the admirable words of Sir Bobus Reel) in the most
mischievous, inflammatory, and ill-conditioned manner to the very
worst passions that can be engendered by ignorance, poverty, and a
sense of injustice, it is high time that—ah!—somebody else, should
be there to, to—ah!—appeal to—well, quite different passions.
Mr. Moulter (eagerly). Quite so, my Lord! The passions
engendered by the desire to possess the land and exercise its exclusive
privileges are doubtless the fiercest and basest, the most grasping
and unscrupulous that can inspire
Marquis (disturbed). Ahem f Moulteb, Ahem!
Mr. Moulter (adroitly). That can inspire those whom pedigree and
a wise Providence have not marked out as the inheritors or—ahem!—
accumulators of Landed Property.
Marquis (relieved). Well turned, Moulteb, well turned! I must
certainly sound Smugsby about your probable chances in Slugford.
But now, how about that trespass case in Pibrochshire?
Mr. Moulter. My Lord, in future any person caught off the main
roads in any of your Lordship's Game Counties will be liable to be
shot as a poacher; whilst anyone found wandering in the hills with-
out a pass, may be summarily pitched over the nearest precipice, or
tossed into the next loch.
Marquis. Ah! that's as it should be, Moulteb! Nothing less
will keep the moors and mountains free of the confounded herd of
tourists, and botanists, and painter-fellows, or make the Rights of
Property worth a twopenny rap, as Lord Handy Bibchem would say.
By the way, what do you calculate is the net gain to me of the leases
that have just fallen in at Westminster?
Mr. Moulter. A million and a quarter, mv Lord.
Marquis. All Unearned Increment, as the gabbling doctrinaires
call it.
Mr. Moulter. Every penny, my Lord.
Marquis. Hum! hum! Anything further to tell me this morning,
Mr. Moulteb?
Mr. Moulter. Well, m'Lord, I think we shall succeed in getting
the Bill through for constituting the Thames above Slangbourne a
strict preserve, for making Wastwater a private lake, for summarily
ejecting the twenty thousand tenants on the Crowsfoot Estate, for
erecting an hotel in the middle of Hyde Park, for enclosing Burnnam
Beeches, and running a railway with twenty stations through the
Lake District. The Nail-man, as your Lordship humorously calls
Mr. Hammebhead of Birmingham, opposed them all; but his oppo-
sition was too evidently interested. We were able to Bhow how nis
Gray's Common Estate gradually grew from permission granted to
his great-grandfather to put a donkey out to grass there. This
created a prejudice against him which nis demonstration that your
Lordship's Fenbury f lats Park originated in a stolen drying-ground
surreptitiously enclosed failed to remove.
Marquis. Naturally, naturally!
Mr. Moulter. And quite properly! How could Landed Estates
have been accumulated, without those time-honoured and law-con-
secrated ahem! appropriations which rude and rascally Radicals
call theft f Shall we say that the Israelites stole Canaan; that
William the Conquebor stole England, or that your Lordship and
your Lordship's ancestors have stolen the hundreds of thousands of

M "ml Decoration. — The

dian Picture PoBtcr seen
from a distance.
NOTES BY ' N1BBS."
(Literary and Dramatic).
Towards the finish of a carefully con-
sidered and well-written article entitled
"Realism Behind the Footlights," in the
Fortnightly for this month (on the whole
a capital specimen number), Mr. Lewis
Wingfield bestows on Mrs. Kendal un-
qualified and, as agreeing with him I may
add, well-merited praise. "Nothing," he
says, "comes amiss to Mrs. Kendal."
True. She can do everything she under-
takes "in an equally admirable manner."
True again, though "equally" may be
taken as a subtle qualification of the
"admirable." But Mr. Winofield goes
on to apologise for her thus: "She has
been unfortunate, however, of late in the
series of parts she has been called upon to
interpret."
Now, Mrs. Kendal is to all intents and
purposes a Manageress. "Hare and
Kendal" means Vl Hare, Kendal, &
Co.," though not so nominated in the
playbill, and is it likely that this lady
would ever be 'galled upon to interpret a
part" which she had not herself chosen? Wouldn't she have a voice
in it, and a pretty powerful one too? Don't Managers choose
their own pieces and their own parts? And as from unfortunate
experience they come to mistrust their own judgment on merely
hearing a play read to them, or on reading it themselves, is not
this the reason why they rush over to Paris to see a new play
performed, when they flatter themselves that they can at once tell
you if, in an English dress, it will suit a London public?
But this by the way. If Mrs. Kendal has been ''unfortunate of late
in a series of parts," surely she has only herself and partners to thank.
Mr. Wingfield by implication throws the blame on the Authors, as
is the fashion with some Critics who, not liking to blame the Actor,
"'give it' to the Bard," i.e., make a scape-goat of the much-
enduring, long-suffering Dramatic Author, and force him to stand as
whipping-boy for some popular stage favourite. Mr. Lewis
Wingfleld knows better than this—ana this is the only unreality
in his " Realism behind the.Footlights."
The compilation of the new volume entitled The Humour and
Pathos of Charles Dickens must have been a labour of love to Mr.
Ciiarles Kent. It might rank among a list of Dickens's " Guide-
Books," only this is a Guide-Book to Dickens's Works, which is of
course a very diiferent affair. There is a fitness, too, in the name of
the compiler of this work, as it is right that Kent should cherish the
memory of Dickens, Dickens having been very much attached to
Kent,—specially that part of it about Rochester. Charles Dickens's
Kent can say with Shakspeare's faithful and modest Kent to
King Lear,—
"I can keep honest counsel . . . .: that which ordinary men are fit for,
I am qualify'd in; and the best of me is diligence."
I have seen a little book called Chips from Thackeray, selected by
Thomas Mason. It can be carried in an ordinary waistcoat-pocket,
and is a delightful companion which no gentleman's pocket should be
without. "Chips" is a dry-sounding title, and suggestive of "the
morning after," but, apart from this, I strongly recommend it, for
size ana substance, ana as for its cost, why, it is of course—" chip
at the price."
All sorts and conditions of pieces are coming out, and one of them
will have seen the footlights before this notice appears. I mean
Mr. Reece'8 Our Helen at the Gaiety. By the way, putting this
and that tradition together, the beautiful Helen seems to have
become quite a respectable person, and a thoroughly decent member
of Greek Society. She proved to be a devoted mother, and paid the
strictest attention to the education of her son and daughter, Eupho-
rion and Hermione, who were the classic originals of Helen's Babies.
Mr. Windham and talented Company appear at the Criterion,
returning from their American tour before the Irvingites. This is
considerate, as two Stars returning at the same time might have
set us ablaze. As a herald of Our Only Tragedian's return, a book
of "Henry Irving's Impressions of America, by Joseph Hatton ";
or "Joseph Hatton's Impressions of America, by Henry Irving ";
or "Hatton's Impressions of Irving in America"; or "Irving's
Impressions of Hatton"; or "Hattorfs and Irving's Impressions of
each other in America,"—I don't quite remember what the title is,
but it's something of this sort,—is already advertised. I have heard
at least two persons express considerable curiosity on the subject.
Also I have received an interesting pamphlet containing American
criticisms on' Our Only Tragedian. Unfortunately it came in such
a questionable shape, done up just like any one of those nuisances
called "circulars," that it was at once chucked irito the waste-paper
basket. I caught sight of the cover just in time to know wnat a
treasure I had lost.
Mr. John Clayton's St. Bernard mastiff having distinguished him-
self last week and displayed a taste for a tit-bit out of a waiter's leg,
—for which luxury Mr. Clayton had to make a hole in a fiver by the
advice of Mr. Partridge, the worthy beak, who was naturally
"down on him like a bird,"—the Court Management, ever awake to
the advisability of engaging a celebrity, are said to be contemplating
the revival of the old drama entitled The Dog of Montargts, with
the Manager's dog in the title role. Mr. Arthur Cecil thinks the
dog would draw. The waiter swears that he did draw when he went
for his leg,—only that he drew blood, which was not quite what
Mr. Cecil meant. The partners at the Court will probably come to
the conclusion that the noble beast has not rendered himself suffi-
ciently popular to warrant them in running him as a Dog-Star.
Besides the dog displayed a lack of intelligence in not having selected a
distinguished charaoter for his attack; it might have been the right
leg, but it wasn't the right person. If the playful beast had singled
out a Duke, or a Lord, or some notability, and if the sly Dog's
photograph had been previously exhibited in shop-windows, the pro-
duction of The Dog of Montargis would have been the hit of the
season,—or rather it would have been a bite and a big catch at the
Court. Mr. Clayton now describes the St. Bernard as a "good
waiter dog."
But I must pause for more than a minute. In the midst of my
Notes, the April number of Mr. Clement Scott's Magazine, The
Theatre, has been brought in to me. I open it, haphazard, at page
184. 0 my heart! 0 my head! 0 my lungs! 0 my lyre! O
goroo! goroo! What have I seen P Can it be? Why do I suddenly
recall the trim, the sprightly, the comic Polly Eccles f And what
suddenly inspires me to exclaim,—
Let Tennyson tremble! let Browning beware!
Or gone are the laurels they both of 'em wear!
See Polly on Pegasus soaring aloft,—
A serious poem signed " Marie Bancroft!"
I read it once, I read it twice, not having understood it the first
time, and then, like the soldier who lent a certain amount on his
sword, I wipe away a tear, as, once more inspired, I strike my lute,
and sing softly—very softly, and very Bancroftly—
How doth the busy Mrs. B.
Improve the shining hour P
By dropping into poctrw
With Silas Wegg-like power.
The Poetess sings of something that passed "over her boyhood"
—(Mrs. Bancroft's boyhood! 0, Pitpo! bless her!)—" like a beam
of holy light." What sort of light is this? Lime, electric, or ordinary
gas? Ah me! but it's too beautiful! And then, struggling with a
choking sensation in my throat, I read on about a darkness which
can never feel Returning day." What day's this? Quarter Day?
Income Tax Collector's Day,—which is a good specimen of a " Return-

scale her flights of stairs up to the Attic regions with my two-foot-
high air of library steps f No; I cannot understand why, when
someone "bids her live," she should obstinately wish to do exactly
the reverse, and " would fain forgotten lie 'neath the cold still earth."
Mrs. Bancroft is evidently not an advocate for cremation. There's
a touch of the old Byronic sparkle (the H. J. Byronio Burlesque
sparkle, I mean) about the finish, where I fancy I deteot a pun of
her "boyhood," in the last line, "Death shall ring out the nuptial
bell, And be my bride." "Ring" "belle" and ,rbride"—it's all
there, a trifle veiled, or rather Hood-ed. But Marie come up! it is
so beautiful and so comforting, like the word Mesopotamia to the old
woman.
Called Sack is being dramatised by Mr. Comyns Carh. He has
set himself a most difficult task. It is to be produced at the

again by a demonstrative and gratified Public. I shall be jubilant
at its triumph, and shall sing (making free with Mr. Care's name,
not, I fancy, for the first time, in an adaptation of the first line of the

"THEIR VERY GOOD HEALTH!"
Some alarm having, not unnaturally, been expressed in the neigh-
bourhood of South Kensington at the announcement recently made
in the papers to the effeot that one of the principal features of
attraction at the forthcoming "International Health Exhibition"
would be a display of "all the deadliest disease-germs of Europe"
carefully housed and catalogued according to their respective locali-
ties, the Council have not been slow in doing their best both to allay
a needless panic and re-establish public confidence. Not only have
they pointed out that the bacillus of Malaria and the other kindred
monsters of devastation whose services they have had the happiness
of securing for the Exhibition, "will be securely chained up, and
not suffered to roam loose about the grounds," but they have issued
a brief supplementary programme of the proceedings arranged for
the opening day, calculated to show that though a purely hygienic
aim has animated the promoters of the undertaking, yet that a due
regard has been paid to the requirements of light and even jocular
scientific recreation, coupled with an eye to the necessity of achieving
a sound financial success. The dooument (subjoined) may probably
be improved upon between this and the 8th of May, but its compre-
hensive drift is evident; and there can be no aonbt about the
spirit in which it will be received by the vast majority of the sight-
seeing Public:—
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH EXHIBITION, SOUTH
KENSINGTON.
(Programme of Inaugural Proceedings.)
N. B.—The doors will open punctually at three a.m.
At a quarter-to-four precisely, the Principal Members of the

opening Madrigal, commencing with, the words—
"How doth the little early -n orm
Get up at any hour!"
—the music of which will be specially composed for the occasion in
the Early English School by a rising student of the Royal College of
Music.
To further'practically illustrate the hygienic aspect of the subject,
a rise will now be got out of the season-ticket holders (who, it is pre-
sumed, will arrive at about five), by the dosing of all the doors of the

shillings extra.

fying the danger of damp, by lying down on the stone-floor until
they contract a severe chill in sight of the audience, and are
removed shivering.

Aleoholic but innocently intoxicating effervescing stimulant.
6 r.v.—The Food that Others Eat.
Threepenny Table cPHSte, consisting of two tinned soups, two
tinned oysters, two tinned entries, cut off a frozen joint, with

"Gin a body" in chorus.
11 p.m.—Fourth Grand Display of Sanitary Fireworks.
Valetudinarian galop, culminating in a grand Hygienio revel.
Attempted lecture on the sudden diffusion of disease, illustrated
by upsetting of a 1900-gallon tank, and escape in all directions

With Last Final Grand Display of Sanitary Fireicorks and
letting off of set-piece scientifically illustrating the Apotheosis of
the weary South Kensington traveller reaching the glittering
City of Hygeia (after taking it in the distanoe, by mistake, for
Cremorne restored), and finding that over its golden portals is
written the beautiful and healthful legend,
"Admission, One Shilling."
WHAT WILL THEY DO WITH IT?
"The Eight Hon. Gentleman (Mr. Saiees) had said that Property and
Intelligence would excite the hatred and contempt of the new class of elec-
tors. But at Aylesbury the Agricultural Labourers showed their hatred of
Property by using their votes to return a member of the house of Rothschild,
and their hatred of Intelligence by returning the humble individual who was
now addressing them, {laughter and cheers.)"—Mr. G. Eubbbll, on the
new Reform BUI.
What will your answer be, Sphinx of the Fallow-land?
Under what flag will you march to the poll P
Randolph assures us you 're dreadfully shallow, and
Raises would deny you a mind and a soul.
Will you plump for the nostrums of feather-brained Socialists,
Lending to quacks a bucolical ear?
Will you league with Teetotallers P—join the Cremationists,
Harpies who'd rob a poor man of his bier f
Will you vote for a Warton, to show your " intelligence " P
Return Mr. George, as a hit at your Squire P
To spite your poor Rector, perhaps you '11 use diligence
To give Mr. Brad laugh a seat for a shire P
Will you turn out a Jingo, and deem it quite requisite
To harry your dreamland with dangers that fly?
Is Fowler your choice, or the Militant Exquisite
Who on fifteen large Continents keepeth an Eye f
Great hobnailed Conundrum 1 your vote is a lottery.
Will you, out of revenge for a beggarly fate,
Run your plough through the Church, and your harrow through
Property?
Oh, grant us a glimpse of your cerebral state!
Are you Whig, Rad, or Tory? In partisan history
Do you favour a constant " rotation of crops" P
Let us trust that in time, super-Asian Mystery,
You'll be one of our grand Constitutional props!
'Oorah for 'Appy 'Olbohn !—The new Gray's Inn Road is avast
improvement. It is a noble thoroughfare. But when is that ugly
ola wall of Gray's Inn coming down ?—of course without hurting
anybody. Let us have light elegant railings, and a good view of
the beautiful garden and trees, onoe part of the "grazir' fields,"
"which," Our Own Antiquary Btates, "gave the name to this locality."
He adds that "he speaks under correction." [Does he? He.'ll.yell

Set, who can think and talk of nothino but Politics and Sport!"

[Lady Clara conceives the happy thought of combining the two.
"MIRAGE."
The Spring is round us with its budding green
And brightening sun-shafts under English skies;
But 'tis not April shifts of shade and sheen
That draw all English eyes.
Our thoughts are in the Desert, where there stands
Alone, o'erlooking the unpeopled waste,
The scattered sun-bleached rocks and barren sands,
One at whose cry a people's feet would haste.
That cry comes not,—so calm official lips
With comfortable certainty protest;
Yet fail to still the tumult of unrest
In many hearts; word-clouds will not eclipse
The vision of that lonely watcher, lone
'Midst alien hordes, on England's business gone;
Followed by England s eyes, and followed not
By England's arms! A wolfhaund on the slot
Held tight in leash, less eagerly looks out
After the unseen quarry, than we gaze,
Phrase-checked, through Policy's confusing haze
Toward that watcher stout!
What are his thoughts P His glance,
Clear as the glitter of an Arab lance,
Cleaves the dim desert-haze. What docs he see?
The vanguard of his country's chivalry?
She was not wont to leave her bravest sons
With cool deliberate forecast to their doom;
Her rescuing onset not the dread simoom,
Spear jungles, huge array of hostile guns,
Or mountain gorge, or black miasma-breath,
Would check; nay, nor the bodily menace of Pale Death
With all his horsemen!
True, no hot appeal
Flashed through the wires for her avenging steel.
But since she knows him—and her honour, well,
What need of that? He has no wish to point
All-marring Faction's calculated yell
Of simulated horror, or unjoint
State-armour for his safety. Make his name
A stalking-horse for the sham patriot troop
Of mean place-hunters, who with howl and whoop
Pursue their quarry? 'Twere too great a shame!
His life is but a light-held gift, to yield
With cheery ease upon the stricken field,
Or at the gate of danger, where to stand
Like that Pompeian sentinel, and die,
Not called upon to strike, scorning to fly,
Is duty simple, unexciting, grand
With a calm grandeur that's beyond the reach
Of furious stragglers in the perilous breach.
Yet—yet—one man, much hampered, here as there,
By Party shifts, by philanthropic prayer
Purblind in narrow zeal, 'midst ceaseless change
Of circumstance and policy whose range
None can forecast, one man, and he not free,
May need,
"What is it that I seem to see
Across the sand waste? Is it the quick gleam
Of English steel, or but a desert-dream'(

The mocking Mirage of the Wilderness?"

PETER POOHBOSH—A MYSTERY.
[It is right to say that, in spite of appearances, the following Romance is
not from the pen of the AtUhor of "Paul Vargas," a tale published
in the current number of the "English Magazine")
Peter Poohbosh was not exactly a friend of mine. He was
uncouth and unpopular, and had a wonderful pair of eyes. They
were strange and weird eyes, and reminded me strongly of the eyes
of a character in a now half-forgotten Burlesque-comedy called
Engaged. In Engaged, a strange influence over the hero of the
piece was exercised by the owner of the eyes. In like manner, Peter
Poohbosh exercised a strange influence over me. When he looked
at me with his terrible eyes, I felt that I must do what he asked me,
no matter what. Before now I have lent him sixpence!
The first time I saw Peter Poohbosh, it was just before his
inquest. He had been run over by an express train, and was scarcely
recognisable. However, he was identified by his eyes. I attended
his funeral.
A fortnight later I was in Venice. My gondola was hugging the
side of the Grand Canal, so as to afford room for a magnificent pro-
cession of boats containing bands of music, lackeys giving away
largesse, professed cooks distributing food gratuitously to the poor,
and other evidences of the bounty of Someone. The Someone was
the hero of the hour. He was seated in a magnificent steam-launch
oovered with flags, and decorated with the most expensive Crystal
Palace Fireworks, which, in spite of the daylight, exploded with
much brilliancy. Beside him sat, or rather reclined in his arms, a
deliriously beautiful girl, who seemed pleased with the gay scene.
The Someone himself was dressed in a suit turned out by Poole, and
a hat contributed by Lincoln and Bennett.
It was Peter Poohbosh!
"You are surprised to see me," he observed. "After being dead
and buried, it is strange to be alive and prosperous. I know you are
thinking thus." And then he looked at me with his wonderful eyes,
and, in spite of all my efforts to banish the thought from my mind, I
was forced to think this.
"Come home, as it is all over," he continued. "You consider me
extravagant—well, perhaps I am. I have been living at the rate of
£500,000 a-year—for nearly half an hour!"
I did go home with him. He seemed to be on good terms with the
deliriously beautiful girl, but told me he intended to leave her.
"Yes, he said, "I have now spent all my money, and propose to
die." fie kept his word by there and then jumping into the kitchen
fire. He was entirely consumed, and the deliriously beautiful girl
wept over his ashes.
After this I never expected to see him again. Under all the cir-
cumstances of the case, was I wrong? However, why discuss this?
I was wrong.
As a medical man, my profession had taken me to a small mining
town in the interior of the South Pole, called New-Brompton-and-
Islington. New-Brompton-and-Islington was a rough-and-ready
place. The miners had a rude sort of etiquette amongst themselves,
which they maintained with the aid of revolvers and bowie-knives.
I had some practice consequently in gunshot-wounds and lock-jaw.
I had, however, a few leisure moments on my hands, and these
few leisure moments I very naturally devoted to the management of
a little speculation of my own—a huge steam sausage manufactory.
I was standing one day beside a gigantic meat-mincing machine,
driven by eight enormous engines, when Someone touched me on the
shoulder. It was Peter Poohbosh! He was dressed in rags and
tatters, and evidently had been starving.
"Iam not so rich as I was when we met at Venice," he said, with
a bitter laugh. He looked at me with his horrible eyes, and, in spite
of my strong disinclination to do anything of the sort, I teas forced
to believe him!
"What has become of"
"The deliriously beautiful girl? Yes, I have deserted her." And
he plunged into the gigantic meat-mincing machine! We could not
stop the engines in time to save him. He went with the rest, and
I never, never expected to see him again.
I was mistaken. A week later I was accosted by the deliriously
beautiful girl. She rushed at me, knocked me down, stamped on
me, and then asked, with strongly-suppressed emotion, "where she
would find her love." I gave her a local paper. She eagerly read
the account of the " accident," and, with a despairing scream, flung
herself into the gigantic meat-mincing machine.
This thoughtless act caused me much annoyance, as, shortly after
the disappearance of Peter Poohbosh, there had been some slight
complaints amongst our customers. One of them indeed had returned
(certainly accompanied by an apology) a sausage seemingly composed
entirely of chopped-up bluoher boots. In fact we had somewhat
suffered in credit.
I had taken up a pen to try to set things right, when I heard a
laugh behind me—a weird, unearthly laugh. I turned round and
met Peter Poohbosh face to faoe!
"Not dead!" I exclaimed, incredulously.
"Certainly not!" was the wild reply, as, with a glare of one of
his'.dreadful eyes, he disappeared into a precipice at the summit of
some snow-capped mountains.
The noxt time I saw him But stay, I find that I have filled my
allotted space. So I must conclude. I do conclude. I repeat I
have seen Peter Poohbosh again. But where ? *
* Private Note from Contributor to Editor.—I can do any amount of this,
if you like. Can send in reams of it.
Editor to Contributor.—Capital! excellent!! But no more—it's too
terrible.
TWO WOMEN!
[When tho news of the Duke of Albany's death arrived, the Empress of
the French at once repaired to Windsor Castle: the Quesx received her,
silent and speechless, in a long and affectionate embrace.—Morning Paper.]
When the dismal bells are tolling, and the City's draped in woe;
When with sympathetic sorrow pass the people to and fro;
When across the ancient harbour booms the dreadful minute-gun,
Saying Princes are but mortal and another race is run;
Wnen the muffled drums are beating, and a Nation holds its breath
At the door where silent mourners own the Majesty of Death,
Let us gently lift the curtain, that hangs heavy on the scene,
Where a sad and gentle Empress met a weeping widow'd Queen.
Time has scarcely softened sorrow, scarce the broken heart has healed,
Since they brought the news of terror from a savage battle-field.
Who that lives forgets the story of the youth beloved by all,
Left alone by friends and kinsmen, just to struggle and to fall?
From the mighty heart of England came a wild indignant cry,
When they saw the boy deserted, bravely fight, and nobly die.
Home they brought him to the country that he loved, life's labour
done,
Brought the pride of dead ambition, brought the widow's only son.
Then the people who were watchiDg felt the tears unbidden start.
When the Queen of many mothers took an Empress to her heart i
Once again the battle rages, once again men fall and die;
Once again sad wives are widowed and the little children cry;
Once again—oh! grim example—ere the sacrifioe is done,
Pallid Death demands his victim in a widow's youngest son.
Far away from home and kindred snapt the slender thread of life,
Far from help of those who loved him, gentle Mother, tender Wife.
Home across aividing ocean, home to rest in pomp and pride,
See the kindly brother bringing all that's left ofhim who died.
But the people ever watching lingered sadly on the scene.
When the gentle Empress folded in her arms a weeping Queen!
From a thousand churches' steeples let the City hear the toll,
In the aisles of great cathedrals let the mighty organ roll;
Let the sailors line the jetty, and the Boldiers arms reverse,
As they wait the sad procession and the coming of the hearse!
Let us bring him home with pity, let the choristers prolong
Till they touch the gates of Heaven with their agony of song;
But above the mighty pageant, when the saddened crowds depart,
Will be heard the silent sobbing of a woman's lonely heart;
When the solemn anthem's over, in the distance will be seen.
Clasped together in their sorrow, woman Empress, widowed Queen.
On tie tomb the flowers wither, warm with sweet affection's breath,
But the sorrow that is human is more merciful than Death!
Further Contradictions.
His Lordship has not offered to play the piano for Mr. Cornet
Grain at the St. George's Hall, to assist that gentleman in his
entertainment.
His Lordship is not engaged either to Miss Eastlake, Miss Marie
Linden, Miss Victor, or Mrs. Bernard-Beere. Indeed, until very
recently he had not even heard of these fair and accomplished
Actresses.
And finally there is not the remotest truth in the rumour that
his Lordship is engaged on an "Anecdotal Biography" of his late
highly respected predecessor Sir Alexander Cockbdrn.
An Aspiration.
To take the Common from the Goose, the rhyme
Tells us is an unpardonable crime.
But oh! he'd bring the Country joy and peace,
Who from our Commons would take all the Geese!

[Corrections and Additions sent by Our Extra-Special.)
Mr. Marcus Stone, A.K.A., writes to me to say, "You're all
wrong; that picture is for next year. What I'm doing this year is
called 'Falling Out,'" from which it doesn't require a conjuror to
guess that the subject must be either a baby falling out of window or
a Military one (this is the most likely), representing the troops falling
out on the march. Mr. Stone adds that there is " a pendant to this,"
and, naturally enough, the subject must be Military again, and
called "Falling In. How simple! But simplicity is the mark of
true genius.
Mr. Willie, not an Academician, is giving a representation of
Essex Flats. Either Country Bumpkins, or some new Model Lodging
Houses recently erected in Essex. We congratulate Mr. Wyllie.
Mr. Marks begs to inform me that the picture I mentioned last
week, is one that he has had by him in an unfinished state for some
considerable time. What he is doing this year is "The Angler's
Rest" — a scientific billiard-player using the jigger. "The Pet
Plant"—or the old trick over again; exhibiting how Masters
Tommy and Harry caught Mr. Barlow (the original Mr. Barlow,
not Mr. Barlow, R.A.), in a booby-trap. And others.
Mr. Foynter, R.A., says that his picture will " point a moral and
adorn a tale," and that's all he '11 tell me.
Mr. Briton Riviere, R.A., wires to tell me that he has got
another besides the one I mentioned (which he shan't exhibit now),
and that it is called " The Eve of St. Bartholomew." I may add
that I hear it is very like her.
Mr. J. Townshend wants to know why I have omitted him? He
has selected two subjects, which will endear him to every schoolboy:
one is "Silver Birches," and the other "A Beech (sic) and Birches
in Autumn." A beach is rather an open place; but if it is a publio
school, and the punishment has to be as public as the school, why
However, these are Mr. Townshend's two pictures. I haven't time
to wire to him and get his answer, but it suddenly ocours to me that
these may be pictures for some City Corporation; i.e., "Silver—
Birch's "—the Pastrycook giving an Alderman change for a sovereign;
and the other would be a man from Birch's, watching on the beach
for the arrival of Turtles in the Ship. Nous verrons.
Mr. Goodall, R.A., writes to tell me that I wasn't far out in my
information as to his picture, but that he has got one which I didn t
mention. He calls it "A New Light of the Harem," and it is, of
course, the introduction for the first time of the Electrio Light into
the Sultan's Seraglio.
I can't exactly make out Mr. Frank Dicksee's letter to me about
his picture. As far as I can decipher his handwriting, 1 understand
that the subject of his pioture is two lovers settling the bill of their
supper in a Parisian restaurant, where they have remained uncom-
monly late. I suppose that really it is the gentleman lover who is
"parting," but, as Mr. Dickskk describes it as "Lovers parting at
Daybreak," it does sound as if the pair were settling for their enter-
tainment out of a joint-stock purse. Of course, the motto will be
"Parting is such pain," or something to that effect.

Instead of Madame Justice putting up her shutters and closing ner
shop for an entire day as a mark of respect for the late Duke of

by letting her shopmen carry on " business as usual" for the benefit

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 31.—Nice state of affairs.
Speaker sick in bed, Chairman of Committees ill in Chair, Sir
Thomas Mat carried in and out by elderly Messengers secretly glad
of opportunities of keeping up their training for Bradlat/gh-
whilst Premier, running away from Doctor, got down to House, and
sits on Treasury Bench pale, haggard, and ever so old. Pretty clear
we'll have to shut up shop soon. Regret the less, since we do nothing
particular with it open.
More fooling round Franchise Bill to-night. Gentlemen who might
be supposed to have something better to do, deliver prodigious
speeches, in which they say nothing in the hearing of nobody.
Forster, having shouldered Buoadhurst out of his place, resumes
Debate in ponderous speech. Members wait to hear if he's "going
for" his old colleagues. Finding he's not, they walk out.
"Clear to me," says Forster, "this sort of thing doesn't pay.
When I kick out at the Government, and show Liberal Partv in the
wrong, House crowded, Conservative cheers continuous. When I
Si on other tack, and deliver ordinary Liberal speech, nobody listens,
ust put this all right in Committee. Introduce an Amendment on
a critical point."
Sir Peel followed. House filled up, just as used to when Forster
attacked the Government re Egypt or Ireland. Sir Peel brought
with him thiok sheaf of notes full of impromptu jokes and flashes of
humour to be struck off on spur of moment. House laughs, because
it had assembled so to do. New Members always heard of Sir Peel
as great Parliamentary humorist; accordingly laughed when he
opened his mouth, and roared when he shook his hand over his head,
his fingers loosely held, as if they were a bundle of sausages. Can't
see Sir Peel's humour myself. Strikes me it is founded on study of
Warton's manner, and inspired by ambitious effort to emulate
Lawson's humour. Succeeds better with Warton than with Wil-
frid. Still House laughed, at least for first half-hour. Then Members
began to slink quietly out to catch the post (which had been gone
half-an-hour), and that sort of thing, you know. Wouldn't do to say
Sir Peel was noisily dull. Parliamentary institution; mustn't be
torn down.
Towards midnight Grand Cross appeared on scene. Great anxiety
to see him, and hear opening words, after which House fell off again
with disappointed look.
"Cross a well-meaning man," said Randolph, "a master of clear
exposition, a great coiner of lucid sentences; but, on the whole, pre-
fer to hear him on the Bishops."
Business done.—Vote of Condolence on death of Duke of Albany.
More talk on Franchise Bill.
Tuesday.—Wish Randolph would be more respectful to his
pastors and masters. Quite unexpectedly jumped on Sir S. North-
cote's back to-night, pulled his hair and abused him for not doing
something about Farmer Pell's Motion on Local Taxation. Sir
Staffobd, stung out of his customary mildness of manner, retorted by
calling Randolph a "Bonnet." Randolph seeing how far things
had gone, happily reserved his temper; half rose Dut resumed his
seat.
"I got up," he told me afterwards, "to hurl the foul aspersion in
his teeth and call him a Top Hat, but remembered what was due to
dignity of Parliament, and resisted temptation. These mild men
when once roused are fearfully reckless. He would doubtless have
flung a Pair of Boots at me, and I should have been bound to stigmatise
him either as a Dress Coat or a Pair of Trousers. So we would have
gone throueh the whole wardrobe, and the tone of Parliamentary
debate would have been distinctly lowered. To that I will never be
a party."
More speeoh-making round Franchise Bill. Michael Hicks Beach
on for forty forlorn minutes, with Stansfeld to follow later.
Thought something was in store for us when I saw Stansfeld sitting
in corner seat with lank hair closely plastered down either side of
massive forehead, heavily oiled and carefully parted in the middle.
Pretty to see Cavendish Bentinck giving his hair an extra rumple
at sight of Right Hon. Gentleman.
"Can't abear these Radicals," he growled. "Always protest
against them by every means in my power."
"Nice speech, Stansfeld's," I said to Gibson, whom I found
tearing up the oration he had meant to deliver but daren't after row
about monopoly by Front Bench men. "Ye-es," he said, "but his
style a little hair-oily, don't you think?"
Marriott made first appearance sinoe he turned his coat. Tories
determined to give him good reception, but speech disappointing.
Very little to do with Reform Bill, a great deal to do with Chamber-
lain, whose name turned up in speech as often as the head of
Charles the First in Mr. Dicks' memorial. Rather a scold than
a speech.
Who's your friend the Admiral?" I asked him.
"'Admiral' Crichton do you mean? Why he's some fellow who's
got a fat appointment on the Board of Trade. Chamberlain sucked
his brains on Shipping Bill question. At least so Randolph told me.
But why did House laugh when I mentioned him. Hope Randolph's
not playing his jokes on Me. Won't be safe. I have been on Liberal
side before, and know my way back. Conservative party better be
careful how they treat me." Business done.—None.

[April 12, 1884.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Wednesday.—Debate on Sunday Closing Bill. Quite an anecdotal
afternoon. Members relating personal experiences and those of
friends. Theodore Fby said ne'd " mixed among working men all
his life," but didn't mention the liquor. Denzil Onslow gave
interesting imitations of " a converted clown" and "a saved miner."
Offered to sing " We've left the BarreV' or "Hurrah for the Pump."
House hastily declined. Then he said he "knew a member of the
Ministry who played lawn-tennis on a Sunday." All eyes severely
turned on Dodson.
C. S. Read brought tears to the eyes of Lord Mayor when he
desoribed how, being in Texas with another Member, found Sunday
Closing in force, and couldn't find back-door into bar. After sus-
tained effort, came upon it and seem to have had high old time.
Marriott didn't deny prevalence of drunkenness, but hinted that
Chamberlain responsible for it. W. H. Smith gave the tip to his
constituents. "If pubs closed in London on Sundays, only have to go
to Greenwich or Turnham Green," says he, "and you order what you
like." Most remarkable statement by Cavendish Bentinck. "Almost
impossible to get drunk on a Sunday," he said, with pathetic tone
of regret in his voice. Grand Cross took no part in Debate, but
pricked up his ears at this statement of curious fact by eminent
authority. Warton so interested in discussion didn't observe quarter
to six approach. Talked up to the hour and so talked Bill out.
Business done.—None.
Thursday.—" Anything been seen of Gladstone?" whispered Sir
S. Northcote to W. H. Smith, as he took his seat to-night.
"No. He's all right. Safe at Coombe Warren."
"Then I Warren't he won't Coombe here to-day," says Sir Staf-
ford, beguiled into making little joke.
At half-past five Premier suddenly entered.
"Betrayed!" cried Sir Stafford, ashy pale to the lips. "Ran-
dolph 's at the bottom of this."
"It's all right," said W. H. Smith, vainly trying to hide his own
nervousness. "He's only looked in for Questions. Go off after."
Spirits on Front Bench raised when W. E. G. passed over to
Hartington duty of answering Stafford's shorter catechism.
"Told you so," Smith chuckled. "He can't speak. Poor old
man! Wish he'd take more care of himself. Not at all a bad
fellow, when he's quiet."
Northcote moved the Adjournment. Conservative Party, united
for once, supported him. Opening made, proceeded to trot round
and round old well-worn track, barrel-organ grinding out the tune
'' What's your Policy in Egypt?"
"What s he stopping for r Smith murmured, glancing uneasily
across the table. "Why doesn't he go home before evening dews
fall? Begad, he's taking notes! Don't like look of things.
Northcote down; Gladstone up, evidently in white heat of
passion.
"Dear me, dear me!" said Northcote, thrusting his hands up his
coat-sleeves to get them, at least, out of harm's way. "Wish I'd
never gone in for this. Didn't want to; knew it was a mistake; but
warned if I didn't Randolph would."
Gladstone stamped around in right royal wrath. "Like Bengal
tiger whose dinner's been stolen," says Mactarlane, who's been in
India. Spoke for only thirty minutes. When he sat down nothing
left of Conservative pretensions to patriotism. Only the torn shreds
of general obstruction with special reference to the Franchise Bill.
Worst of it was, Northcote having been shoved unwillingly to the
fore, was left there by party, who tailed off till, at half-past eight,
not a dozen Members present to hear him meekly ask permission to
withdraw Motion for Adjournment.
"Next time this is to be done," he Baid, feeling himself all over to
see if any bones were broken, "you must get someone else to do it.
I have had enough."
Business done.—Lords sent down a Measure called "Bolton-le-
Sands and Warton Reclamation Bill." Read a Second Time. General
impression is, case hopeless.
Friday.—Quite a quiet evening, considering Ireland and Irish
Magistracy were subject of discussion. Justin McCarthy moved a
Resolution on subject in speech of conspicuous moderation. Fixed
attention of House, which concluded there really was something
wanted looking into. Looked into it all night quietly and reasonably
till windbag Sexton appeared on soene, followed by Tim Healy,
who abused Trevelyan as if he had not frankly admitted the
grievance, and undertaken to see it righted. These two speeches
necessary for Irish report. Wouldn't do to let it be seen that modera-
tion of manner and reasonable argument have any effect in Saxon
House of Commons. Business done.—Annual Army Bill passed.
Our excellent old friend, Mrs. Ramsbotham, is deeply interested
in political and social subjects. She says, apropos of one of the
burning questions of the day, that she can quite understand Sir
Vernon Harcottrt's statement of the popular objection to what
Mr. Ch amberlain calls " Unurned Incremation."
ROBERT" AT GUILDHALL.
I sorntered the other day into Gildall and erd my old frends the
Common Counsellmen a trying to himitate the Ouse of Commons,
by having a werry long tork about a matter with witch they hadn't
nothink to do, and thereby negleokting there own affairs. It did
emuse me, it did, to hear my old paytrons almost a cussing and a
swairing about Eddicatin the Peeple. Now, though they 're as good
and as jolly a set of fellers as I ewer waits on, and knows as mutch
about the hart and sience of reel dining as ewen a Royal Prinse,
they haynt what we shood call quite the reel Turtel as regards eddi-
cashun. Their conwersayshun at dinner is all rite enuff. Many on
'em are just as partickler as us, and chewses their words more care-
fooler even than we does, but it's ginerally always about the same
top picks, and them's not littery nor skientiftick.
The Gent as throwd off fust was ewidently a Common Counsellor
of Skotch extracshun, for he said, as pussonally he rayther liked
eddicashun if it didn't cost nuffin, but the fust thort in all matters,
big or little, was the Siller, and 8J</. was the last straw as broke the
Rate Payers back, and you shood never teech a child more than his
Farther knowed, or he'd despige him, and this was wot he called
trew adwansing eddicashun, and I for one quite agrees with him
there. He was follered by a fine looking Gent, who said as the
Skool Board was a teeching all the little children chimistry and
druggistry and Lattin,'and yet they found time enuff to be a running
about in the gutter all day long, as they did afore, which was rayther
a staggerer for me.
Another Gent said, if they was a going for to eddicate all the
people hup to their hown level, where was they to git their servants
from? Ah, where indeed? And then he told 'em a fact as is a reel
and werry sad fact, namely that hundreds and hundreds of poor
germans comes over to London ewery year to learn our butiful
langwidge, and ware do they go to for to lern it in all its helegance t
Why they turns waiters, and cums to hus! That of course don't
supprize me, cos with our constant assoshiation with Aldermen and
Common Counsellmen, we nat'rally forms about the werry best skool
for the puppose; but see wot foUers, langwidge being their prinsipel
hobject, they don't care mi Inn about their own wages, and so nat'rally
rejewses ours, and after a year or too of our sosiety they leaves our
onerabel calling perfect in langwidge and refined in manners, and
becomes Merchants and Bankers. Wot more nat'ral then, than I
shood jine the Copperashun in denounsing Eddicashun, them for the
crushing weight of 8i<f., me for the reducktion of my lawfool wages.
Sir John Sennit sed as how as if we hadn't more eddicashun for
our Watch makers, we coudn't expect to have good english watches,
and pulling out a grate big gold watch about as big as a turnip, sed
as how as if you wanted a watch like that you must go to Swizzle-
land, for there wasn't a Watchman in all Clarkandwell as he coud
trust ewen to clean it. What a complement to Clarkandwell! He
had the owdasity, too, to speak of his oponents as old fogies, and to
look forard with satisfakshun to the time when they wood be goDe
to a higher spear, and leave the world to go on without 'em! and
even spoke of a reel Deputty without calling him by his onered
title, and wen cauled to order by the indignent Lord Mare, acshally
said as he always spoke of His Lordship, out of doors, as Fowler!
One Member, who I was told has a grate deal to do with Littery-
ture, made a speech after my own art, when he said, that " he for
one hadn't not no objecshun to giwing to Poor Children the dry
bread and dutch cheese of Eddioashun, but he most strongly objected
to giving 'em its Port Wine!" if he had only hadded speshally
I should, Ibleeve,have shouted out "Here! Here!" though the Field
Marshall was close bv me with his undrawn sword.
'Stonishing wot information one gits at Gildhall. Who wood have
ever found out, except a Common Counsellman, that the poor children
in Bored Skools is so owerworked that it has shortened all the
Sojers in the Army bv about half a hinch in length, and a hole un in
sircumfrence round the Chestes! And wood eny other common man
ha' had the pluck to say as he offen and offen seed children a-playing
in the gutters who was as tall as he was, and that must have been
about 5 foot 8!
One or too of the young members tried to git in a word or too for
the Poor Skool Bored, who they sed never has no dinners, but it
warn't not of the least use. Whenewer they thought as they'd made
a pint, the awful words %\d. sounded like a Nell in their years. Wot
was the use of torking about eddicated forren workmen taylors
a-cutting out our own hignerent snips as weU as their coats, or of the
hartistio forringer supplying all our French Clocks and our Ginhevir
Welwets, the fatal signal Sid., tho it sounded like the prise of a
quorten lofe or a pound of sugger of long ears gone by, sent a shudder
all through the Cownsel Chamber as nuffin could resist, and I came
away with a strong conwiction against me that if onr pore uneddi-
cated workmen wants to be let alone, and have their littel children
let run about the streets and. enjoy theirselves as Natur tort 'em to,
they'd better apply for asistance to the Court of Common Coun-
sellmen. Robert.

OUT-OF-PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION.
To the Editor of " Fundi."
Dear Sir,
The question of Cumulative Voting is of so much importance
that I feel sure you .will permit me to ventilate it in the columns of
your paper—a paper particularly suitable for such a discussion. Sir
John Lubbock has recently written to one of your contemporaries,
suggesting that when there are five seats and twelve candidates, the
extra votes should be given to the five, and not the twelve. At least
that is the impression ne has left upon my mind. I subjoin an alter-
native scheme.
Say, there are ten Candidates and eight Seats. Let everyone have
as many votes as he pleases (there is nothing like liberality in such^a
matter as this), and, allowing a large margin for various idiosyn-
crasies, we can fanoy the following result:—
Mr. Gladstone 2,400
Mr. J. L. Toole (representing Mr. Wilson Barrett) . . 18,016
Mr. Sptjrgeon 7
Cardinal Manning 452
Mr. Griffiths (the Safe Man) 29,645
Lord Randolph Churchill (representing himself) . . 1
Mr. Bradshaw (representing the Railway Interest*) . . 86
Secretary, General Omnibus Company . . , . .4,000,000
Mr. Wilson Barrett (representingMr.LAwhence Barrett) 6
Miss Mary Anderson (representing Lord Coleridge) . 1
Having obtained this result, our course is quite clear. Miss Mary
Anderson (as a foreigner and a Lady), the Secretary of the General
Omnibus Company (as an injudicious selection), and. Mr. Griffiths
(because he is a safe man), maybe struck out at once. We then
have remaining. Messrs. Gladstone, J. L. Toole, Spubgeon, Wilson
Barrett, Lord Randolph Churchill, and last, but not least,
Cardinal Manning. This will give us seven Candidates for eight
Seats. Clearly some addition will be required. For the sake of
fairness, it would be advisable to add at least five; say, Mr. John
Hollingshead, Mr. Comyns Carr, Sir Edward Watkln, Sir Andrew
Clark, and Mr. Val Prinsep. We now submit the amended list to
the next voter, when we need not be surprised if he sends in the
following returns:—
MtSot Ttoneselli J Dead heat
The Ghost of Hamlet's Uncle—Nowhere.
This result should be most satisfactory, as it would argue that it
was furnished by a lunatic—a member of a highly esteemed class,
for which it is, however, most difficult to obtain adequate representa-
tion. The first and the last of these candidates would be rejected on
account of their disabilities to sit in Parliament. There is no reason,
however, why the votes given to them should not be added to Mr.
Spuhgeon'8 series. Now, say we give the amended list to a thousand
persons taken hap-hazara, as of course the plan I am advocating is
merely an experiment to see how it works, and not to test the poli-
tical bias of our much-loved country—we should possibly have this
result:—
Mr. Gladstone 4,792
Mr. J. L. Toole 29,000,000
Mr. Spuegeon 7
Cardinal Manning 10
Mr. Bhadshaw 8,400,762
Mr. Comyns Carr 97
Sir E. Watkln 243
Messrs. Hollingshead and Prinsep (coupled) . 763
It is obvious that the natural thing to do now would be to rejeot
Mr. Bradshaw, and take away his votes. Having done this, matters
would be made more ship-shape by every voter thinking of a number,
doubling it, adding seven to it, dividing it by five, and putting the
total thus reached to the credit of his favourite candidate. This, of
course, would be merely a question of figures.
You will notice that I have done my best in the above rough sketch
to meet all possibilities. With the coming Reform Bill no doubt we
shall have quite a new kind of electors, for whose peculiarities wide
allowance must be made. They are given votes, and it is, conse-
quently, of importance that those votes should be properly utilised.
Unless those who possess the franchise are carefully instructed
beforehand, it is not improbable that the tossing of a halfpenny may
decide many a difficult question of choice. Ana as we cannot reason-
ably expect that every voter will have a profound knowledge of the
higher branches of the Mathematical Science, the simpler the process
of election advocated the better.
And now, Sir, having inaugurated the idea, and suggested a
scheme which seems to me quite as comprehensible as that proposed
by Sir John Lubbock, I leave it to others with more time at their
disposal than I have to develope it.
With sincere rospect, yours truly,

A FRIENDLY REMONSTRANCE.
Mr. Punch, Sir,
I am one of that misunderstood and somewhat maligned
race called Common Councilmen. We are generally considered to be
neither a poetical nor even a literary class of mankind; but that is, I
assure you, a great mistake. I have heard lofty flights of eloquence
in our Court that have, I should think, been rarely equalled, seldom
excelled. I have heard an impassioned Orator exclaim, when called
to order, "My Lord Mayor, I stand upon my nucleus!" which so
astonished his Lordship that he allowed him to proceed. I have
heard a member, whom we all considered as our most accomplished
French scholar, warn the Court that, if they were not very careful,
"they would put their foot into a. faux pas!" and, as we looked
somewhat doubtfully, he declared his firm resolution not to be put
hors de combat by a side-wind! He was afterwards proposed as
Chairman of our Library or Literary Committee, and received the
support of men of University fame, high in the service of their
pountry, and who will probably shortly be high in the service of
important constituencies. I give these as mere samples, to show
that we are not the unlettered race that some imagine us to be, and
I wish, Sir, with your permission, to show the world of Literature
that we sometimes, upon the very slightest provocation, soar into the
very highest regions of imaginative poetry.
In September last I visited Switzerland accompanied hymy Wife
and my Mother-in-law, and, one beautiful evening, my Wife being
too fatigued to accompany us, her dear Mother and myself went out
for a stroll. We ascended the Matterhorn, at least we ascended a
portion of it, and, in reply to my companion, I boldly informed her
that Matterhorn was Swiss for Mother-in-law, as Jungfrau was for
a Bride, so that I might fairly claim the pair, at which pretty conceit
she was pleased to say that I was a born Poet. At this particular
moment a pair of evidently youthful lovers passed along in the valley
below, and, the divine afflatus being upon me, I improvised the
following lines, whioh, my astonished Mother-in-law assured me
breathed all the mystic passion of Shelley :—
The thundering avalanche lingered on its way,
The friendly moon obliged them with a ray.
At length, a well-known cloud appeared in tight,
And, to their horror, bathed them in the night!
On another occasion I commenced a description of the Jungfrau,
which ran thus:
The Jungfrau's snow shines like condensed milk
O'er Umbs whose symmetry would set off silk.
but my kindly Mother-in-law thought the lines slightly improper, so
I did not continue them. I perhaps may as well add, that I was so
pleased with her candid and truthful criticism on my Matterhorn
poem, that I gave her that little cheque for her dear Alfred, that I
had refused in the morning with some unnecessary asperity.
J. Litgce.
Same Thing!
"Satan rebuking sin "'s a useful phrase,
But since some fear on rudeness it may border,
A substitute is found in these last days
In " Healy rising to a point of order"!
There is no truth in the report that Primrose Hill is in future to
be called Mount Beaconsfield.

icoount that has been standing some time, upon which B. artfully

5. A younger son, who has first-floor Chambers in St. James's
Street, considers it necessary to himself and to his position to keep a
job, belong to five Clubs, sport an Opera Stall, have a running
iccount with all the leading Bond-Street tradesmen, give away occa-
sional presents of jewellery, and never let his most moderate dinner
cost him less than fifteen-and-sixpenoe. How long can he keep up
;his style of thing comfortably on an income of £120 per annum P
6. A Creditor determines to recoup himself by seizing the goods of
i Debtor; but, on arriving for the purpose, finds that he has already
jecn anticipated by some naif-dozen bills of sale. As no execution
s now possible, can he be regarded as the victim of a "hopeless
ittachmcnt," and will he, falling to recover on the property, be
ikely to rally from the shock?
7. State all you know about "Fraudulent Conveyance." Would
the riding of the Bankrupt's Solicitor with his bag behind a four-
wheeled cab, without the knowledge or consent of the driver, be a
"fraudulent conveyance of property " within the meaning of the Act P
8. What is an "Undischarged Bankrupt"? Fully examine and
explain the meaning of the phrase, with reference to the probability
of his going off altogether if too heavily loaded.

ROBERT ON THE BILL
So the fatal Nell is struck at larst! and Sir William Weed ant
Arcoubt, after giving two long ears to its considerashun, has struck
his fatal blow!
And in wot a artful way! Does he say as how as the sacred Cop-
perashun has bin and gone and got worn hout with age, and ard
work, and igh living? No, not he; but, on the oontrary, ne acshally
says as it's sitch a nobel and exstrawnery hinstitushun that it's too
good for the little Citty, but just good enufi for all London. Well,
that seems to a pore Waiter, who orfen and orfen sees Common
Counselmen and Washupf ool Haldermen at their very best, about
the rummest reeson for sending 'em all about their bizziness as ever
I heard on. But then think how hartfully as it's all dun. He says
as they are sitch a nobel lot of chaps as it's quite himpossible to do
without sum on 'em, jest to set the new set of hignoramuses a-going,
and to sho 'em how to do heverything of himportenee, sitch as
bordering dinners, and making free with Kings and Neros and hillus-
trated. swells of all sorts, and so about 40 of the werry best Common
Counselmen is to be slecktod for that pupuss, and as nat'rally every
man Jack on 'em thinks as he's sure to be one of the helect, Sir
Weed ant at wunce disharms the lot and sends 'em away smilin.
But there's jest one serious pint as amost brort tears to my eyes
when I erd it. He acshally has the hawdacity to habollish, at wunce
and for hever, all the nobel Harmy of Haldermen, 26 in number, who
has bin for about seven hundred ears, the pride, and glory, and
hadmurashun, and henvy of mankind in general, and Ladies in
partickleher. Wat has lent its grandest charm to our Citty per-
sesions? wat has lited up with the brilyansy of a Rain Bow our
nobel Citty Bankwets? Wot has reminded all hobserwers of
Soltman in hall his glory? Why, the jawgeous Scarlet Robes of
our rewered Aldermun. And now, all alike, weather they bes the
somewhat faded glorys of half a Sentry's wear/or the brite dazzling
things of joy and buty that has been bort and paid for at enormus
corst within the last few munce, all alike is to be oarst aside, like the
now useless Armer of the Nights of old!
That's bad enuff, but, as the Poet says, "wuss remanes behind."
Not only is they depriwed of their gownds, and their power, but they
are acshally to loose their werry names, and the Court of Haldermen
will set no more? Who's to take charge of the Citty Lunertics,
poor fellers, afterwards, is of coarse too small a matter for a Lordly
Ome Secretary, but as the number will probberbly largely increase
if this terrybel Bill is past, it will have to be attended to.
The awful ideer cums aoross my mind, that wen the New Zeeland
hartist oums here sum five sentrys hence to sketch all the departed
wunders of the ruined Citty, he mite praps dig up the copse of a
fozzil Halderman buried in his skarlet robe f and drop a new zeeland
tear over this rellick of long departed grateness, wen comparing it to
the mizzerabel cullerless substitoots of his native land.
I hopes as I ain't quite sitch a fool as not to know that as other
things change so ewen Sacred Oopperashuns must change, but surely,
surely, Sir weed ant, you mite have given us all, waiters included,
some sort of compensasnun.
My nobel paytrons will nat'rally miss their ard work, and their
soshal injoyments, and wot in the name of all that's dredful is to
become of bus!
My feelinx has reseived that shok by what I herd in the Ouse and
by what I have red out of it, that I cannot suflishently collect my
thorts to exhamin into the warious parts of the Bill, and so shall
resurve that for next week, but I cannot conclood without jest one
solium word of pitty for pore Sir James Mac Garrallous Hogg,
Cheerman of the Metropolis Bored_ of Works. He is at one swell
swoop not only deprived of his Chair and his Bored and his ansom
Sallery of £2,000 a year, but all the compensashun he gits for this
unansum conduk is, that he is made a Common Conselman for three
ears, and no more! Robert.

NOTES FROM "NIBBS."
To Our Only Mr. A. Harris, of Drury Lane, on a Report about a
distinguished Actor.
My dear Augustus Harris,
Aren't you pleased—but I know your noble nature—I
know you are pleased at hearing that the youngest-but-one London
Manager has been
invited to return
thanks for the Drama
at the forthcoming
Banquet of the Royal
Academy! All among
the Swells, Augustus,
all among the Swells.
with the Olympian
Deities! in the Wal-
hallabaloo of the
Arts! Oh, he has
got a chance of dis-
tinguishing himself
this time, has our
own dear Wilson
Barrett, to whom
henceforth we will
sing in chorus (a
Barrett - tone, of
course, whenever you
have the time to spare, and feel inclined to join me), "Oh, what a
lucky young man you are!"
And our dear 8. Bancroft, Esq., who glories in being " the Oldest
Manager in London," won't he be pleased to think that our Wilson
Barrett is to be the first Professional Gentleman invited in a
representative professional capacity to take his place in that
Eminent Assembly among the Bishops and Deans and Lords! The
assemblage will, I regret to say, not be quite so brilliant as in
former years, for Royalty, alas! must necessarily be absent, but still
our excellent Wilson Barrett will be the " thin end of the wedge,"
if he will allow me to call him so, as I believe I am correct in saying
that since the days of Sir Joshua's friend, Garrick, no representa-
tive of the Drama as such, and while still performing, has ever
appeared on the Academy boards and addressed the audience.
Retired Actors, and Actors temporarily out of an engagement, have
frequently, no doubt, enjoyed the Academical hospitality as private
persons and guests of the Academicians, but not I think to be called
upon to return thanks as representatives of the Theatrical Profession,
as distinct from the Drama, for, as you well know, my dear Augustus
Harris, the Actor is made for the Drama and not the Drama for the
Actor. As you have often justly observed, being Author, Actor, and
Manager yourself, "A Dramatic Author should return thanks for
the Drama, and an Actor for the Theatrical Profession." And you
are right. Not but what you are always right, but in this instance
lighter than ever.
Henrico absente, Wilson Barrett appears as " the Vice"—a very-
ancient theatrical character,—with a wand, I believe. And to think
that Henry Irving can't come back in time! How pleased, though,
he will be, how genuinely delighted, when he hears that Wilson
Barrett, our Claudian, arid our coming Hamlet, has been invited to
represent him at the Banquet of the Gods! No doubt he '11 cable a
congratulation. And won t the St. James's Managers be in ecstasies!
and the Court Theatre partners too! And won't they all publicly
express themselves "really pleased that the Theatrioal" ("Dramatic
they'll^ oall it) " Profession nas been recognised by the Royal Academy."
Well, it is nice to think of, and you, my dear Augustus, as Manager
of the National Theatre, entitled to a guard of honour before your
door to keep watch over "Her Majesty's Servants," will rejoice,—
though at the same time the idea may occur to you, why don't
they confer a Knighthood on the Manager of the Royal and National
Theatre, give him a court suit and a decoration (lots of 'em in the
Theatre s wardrobe), and let him have a place by right at the
Advt.—New Four (Sheet) Poster for " Claudian."
Academy Banquet? But, as the leading melodramatic villain says,
"A time will come!"—and you may yet .live to be the first President
of the Royal Dramatic Academy, Sir Augustus Harris! Then will
come Sir Henry Irving, then Sir Wilson Barrett, and, of course,
as Presidents the Royal Comedy Corporation, Sir John Laurence
Toole, Bart. 0 paste and rouge! 0 May and Clarkson! 0
Nathan and Harrison! 0 Auguste and Alias! Here's a glorious
future. But suppose it isn't true, and suppose our Wilson Barrett
hasn't been asked to return thanks for the Drama (he '11 have to
return his audience the money for that night if he doesn't play—
and it's a Saturday night too) at the Academy Banquet? Well,
then—if not—I know what you '11 say—" If not, he ought to be."
Au revoir.' Hope you found that thousand-pound cheque which
the papers said you lost at your hotel in Paris. Give my respects to
Carl Rosa, who is at your theatre by.this time, and tell him how
delighted everybody is at his returning to town. Ask him what has
become of one of the most promising Carmens I ever heard—Miss
Dk la Rue? I see he is bringing out a new Opera, musio by Mr.
Stanford, and libretto by my accomplished young confrere, Gilbert
1 Beckett. It is to be called The Canterbury Pilgrims. Good.
The name A. Beckett is associated with Canterbury and Pilgrims.
For myself, when Carl Rosa is not in London to give me music, I
am mostly a Canterbury Hall Pilgrim. I anticipate a success; and,
at all events, it is not likely that either Mr. Stanford or Mr. G.
A. Beckett will meet with the fate of the latter's distinguished
ancestor, though if the librettist does do so, he will not be the first
Dramatio Author who has done good work and then been murdered.
But absit omen.' my dear Augustus Harris; and. if you will
permit me to add, " Vivent Harris et Carl son ami.'"
Yours devotedly, Nibbs.
P.S.—I see that Triumphant Failure, the Dramatic College,—which
was too near the Woking Cemetery to be pleasant for retired Actors
who didn't want to be perpetually reminded of re-hearsal,—has been
purchased for an Oriental University for visitors and students from
the Punjab. It might have been turned into a sort of Theatrical
Broadmoor Prison for confirmed " gaggers." However, the chance
was lost; the "gaggers" are still at large, and the Pnnjabberers
possess the Dramatic College. Sic transit 7
"VAT A LARKS!"
There is a great Bird Exhibition going on at Vienna, including
"all known birds and their manner of living," and a "Mountain of
Birds," made out of innumerable stuffed victims—who would seem to
exemplify the "manner of dying," not of living. Here is a hint for
South Kensington. Why not a " Grand International Ornithological
Show" next year, with a Sixpenny Grouse and Partridge Dinner—
three courses, not at all high—or any other fowl of the air in season,
and in reason'( The Game might be worth the candle.
Of course, everything remotely connected with birds would come in
useful. For instance, mere might be a picture of the Gentleman who
once shot an arrow into the air, and didn't hit a bird, but hit a tree
instead. Why not engage stuffed specimens of the Early-Bird tribe,
with an "Annexe " for the Early Bird's Early Worms P A "Chamber
of Volucrine Horrors" would be sure to pay—let it include—
1. Models from Life of Pigeon-Torturers.
2. Ditto, ditto of Pigeon-Shooters.
3. Some East-End Bird-catchers, with apparatus for blinding larks
to make them sing.
Then there should be a Section for Extinct Birds, the " Dodo,"
with his cousin the " Don't-on-any-Account," the Cock of the Walk,
the Four-and-Twenty Blackbirds baked in a Pie, the Nightingale of
Shoreditch, the Thrush of Wood Street (Wordsworth's Thrush),
the Phoenix, and (in the American Section) the Spread Eagle, &c, &c.
Then let there be—
1. Singing-matches between rival Canaries.
2. Screeching ditto between Cookatoos. (Entrance free on this day.)
3. Specimens of Poetry about Birds.
4. Busts of the Poets who wrote the Poetry.
5. Names and Addresses of the Tradesmen who supplied hats and
boots to the Poets.
6. Specimens of Hats and Boots which the same Tradesmen are
ready to supply to anybody, even if they don't write Poetry about
Birds, or about anything else.
Pheasants would have a Section to themselves (in the dining-room)
where diners could have a Section of the pheasants to themselves ;—
"not where they eat, but where they are eaten." If supplied gratis,
or in the sixpenny menu, this would be a trump-card for the
Committee to play. However, the Committee, or Managers, or
Organisers, or whatever they are called, must remember that in this
sort of game the "honours" are always "easy "—exceedingly easy.

We read in the papers that a series of
entertainments to Sandwich Men have
recently been given, and that they were
greatly delighted with the mental treat
afforded by the music of Beethoven,
Mozart, and Schubert, and the literature
of Shaksfeare, Tennyson, and Dickens.
If at these gatherings there was a combi-
nation of Beethoven and Beefsteaks,
Mozart and Mutton-chops, Schubert and
Sandwiches, Dickens and Dutch cheese,
Tennyson and Tea, and Shaksfeare and
Shrimps, we can imagine the entertainment
to be very satisfactory. But we fail to see
that Shaksfeare would satisfy the cravings
of hunger, that Tennyson would quench
thirst, or that Mozart and Schubert would
be equivalent to a warm coat and a sound
pair of shoes.

THE SMOKINGKOOM ofthe HOUSE,
BXTKACTBD FROIt
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Tuesday, April 8, 2 a.m.—Division on the Franchise Bill at last.
Comes after six days' debate, and everyone agrees that there has
been nothing to say. Gladstone made another speech. Commenced
by complaining no arguments to meet, and went on through hour
looking for them. Gosciien, who really had something strange to
say, took another hour. Conservatives delighted. Their own men
been rather praising up the Bill, though judiciously hedged by pro-
mising to vote against it. Here was Goschen boldly opposing it, and
declaring he would vote against it!
"Capital speech," said Gibson. "Closely argued, full of sound
principle. Only drawback, Goschen's uncertainty as to whether
he's accidentally come out without his coat. Nothing can long con-
vince him that it is not only on, but buttoned. Hasn't got through
twenty sentences before begins feeling all up the front seams. Con-
tact with buttons convinces him. Then, suddenly, dark suspicion
enters his mind. Perhaps his coat ripped up the back! Feels round
there. All right. Then begins earnestly washing his hands with
invisible soap in imperceptible water, as Shakspeabe says. That
sets him off again. Theory of association of ideas; always got his
coat off when he washes his hands; washing his hands now: Argal,
coat must be off. Without waiting to dry his fingers, he makes a
dash up and down the front of his coat. No. All is well. Still on,
and yet buttoned. Onoe more comes horrible thought. Must, after
all, be Bplit npthe back. Feels himself all over. Reassured. Goes
on describing Democracy. Here again association of ideas comes in.
Democracy grimy handed; grimy hands must be washed; so has
another thorough laundry performance. Doubts about coat, and so
on, da capo. Still, first-rate speech."
Second Reading of Franchise Bill carried by tremendous majority,
340 for, 210 against. Lord Coleridge down to see fun.
"Got any more of those little stories you brought from the
States P" I asked him.
"No," he said. "Fact is (besides having told 'em all) given up
practice. Complaints from friends in America that it's not quite
the thing to go into their society and bring away stories of them-
selves and their doings, their lives and their movements, their dress
recorded, their company catalogued, and their most private relations
dragged into the light of day. So no more stories from me."
Wednesday, 1 a.m.—Last Sitting before the Easter Recess. Spun
out till now. Might just as well have adjourned after Morning
Sitting. But Farnellites implacable.
"Haven't had a row for three days," sighs Joseph Gillis,
"House of Commons going from bad to worse."
Joey B. radiant now. Long sitting morning and evening been
pretty well a continuous row. First of all there was the Detection of
Dodds. That stern inflexible old Gentleman been getting out a
circular asking Members to vote for a Railway Bill on double ground
that his son is Solicitor for the Bill, and that Dodds pire is "anxious
to defeat Mr. Lowthee." Difficult to say which inducement the
more attractive. House pleased to contemplate the implacable Dodds
in position of fond parent; but Truthful James inclined to take
serious view of affair. Randolph equaUy virtuous. "Wolff's
spectacles dimmed with indignation. Dodds penitent, but Randolph
inflexible, and he only escapes by narrow majority on Division.
Habcourt brought in Government of London Bill in speech two
hours long. Thoroughly enjoyed himself, though pleasure of the
afternoon rather palled upon the House. Daddy Dodds, worn out
with exoitement, domestic and otherwise, of earlier part of sitting,
publicly went to sleep behind Treasury Bench.
At Evening Sitting Irish Members in force. Healt had row with
Speaker, in whioh he came off second best.
"You did that capitally, Sir," I said to Speaker, shaking hands
as we left House. ,fIf you have a fault, you 're inclined to go too
much into detail in giving your rulings. Never give a reason; never
refer to your own feelings or anybody else's. You've got the Rules
to go upon. Not your business to justify them. You've done
uncommonly well, especially to-night, and you '11 do better."
Business done.—House adjourns for Easter Recess. Best stroke
of
POETS TO ORDER.
"Posta nascitur non fit." Nothing of the kind. "We have
changed all that in the nresent practical days. See the following
advertisement from the Daily News :—
AMATEUR POETS.—All desirous of entering the ranks of Profes-
sional Writers may hear of an excellent opportunity.—For particulars
send plainly-addressed envelope, &c.
There is something distressingly matter-of-fact and business-like
in_ " for particulars send plainly-addressed envelope." Probably
this gentleman has a selection of picked Poets and selected reach-
me-down rhymesters for his clients to choose from. Possibly we
shall hear of Lord Tennyson taking apprentices, and Mr. Browning
pupils after this. Sonnet-writing will become as commonplace as
stock-jobbing, and we shall be able to engage Poets at a certain
wage, just as we should a Cook or a Footman.
The Evil Genius in a Pantomime going down through a trap-door
may be described as " A Sink of Iniquity."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"Doing it on his Head."
VERY TRYING.
A Record of a few Trials of Patience,
No. X.—Alderman Juggins.
Mb. Alderman Jdggins took his seat on the Bench at the Guild-
hall Police-Court for the first time. Addressing Mr. Guffin, the
Chief Clerk, Alderman Jdggins said:—I
feel the responsibility of my responsible
position, and no one can think too seri-
ously or too highly of the important duties
attending the position of a Chief Metro-
politan Magistrate. But while striving to
perform my onerous duties, I shall always
endeavour to temper mercy with justice.
There was an attempt at applause in
Court, but it was immediately silenced by
Mr. Gufftn, the Chief Clerk.
John Chipps, no occupation, was charged
with snatching a watch .and chain from
Eric Skimmers.
Mr. Skimmers deposed that the Prisoner
ran against him. and apologised for doing so.
Witness accepted the apology, and immediately missed his watch.
Alderman Juggins (to Witness). Would you like to ask the
Prisoner any questions?
Mr. Guffin [the Chief Clerk). I beg your pardon, Sir; you mean
would the Prisoner like to ask the Witness any question.
Alderman Juggins. No, I don't. I know what I mean well
enough. {To Witness.) |If you would like to ask the Prisoner a
question, now is your time. Only be careful what you ask, as it
will be written down, and may be used against you.
Mr. Guffin (the Chief Clerk). Excuse me, Sir. This is not the
usual course.
Alderman Juggins. Then, pray what is?
Mr. Guffin (the Chief Clerk) privately informed the learned
Alderman that when in doubt, if he would consult him (Mr. Gutfin),
he would be properly directed. This was the course adopted by ail
Aldermen, and even by the Lord Mayor himself.
Alderman Juggins. If that is the proper course, I can only say it
is quite time for a complete revolution in the City. What is the use
of an Alderman sitting on the Bench, if the Chief Clerk is to prompt
in the sentences? Where is the dignity of the Alderman under suoh
circumstances? Why, the City might as well be represented by Sti-
pendiary Magistrates, and adone with it. No. I am the Magistrate
here, and shall perform my duty to the best of my honour and ability.
There was an attempt at applause in Court, which was imme-
diately suppressed by Mr. Guffin, the Chief Clerk.
Aide rman Juggins. As the Witness declines to question the
Prisoner, I shall cross-examine him myself.
Mr. Guffin (the Chief Clerk). I submit most humbly, Sir, that
course is irregular. A Magistrate cannot cross-examine the Prisoner.
Alderman Juggins. I tell you he can. It is done abroad. I was
in Paris last Spring, and heard a Magistrate cross-examine a prisoner
for four hours, and Iwould have gone on longer only the Prisoner
fainted in the dock from sheer exhaustion.
Mr. Guffin (the Chief Clerk). Then, Sir, I can only ask you to
relieve me irum any consequences .that may transpire from such a
course as you propose to adopt.
Alderman Juggins. Most oertainly. (To the Prisoner.) Why did
you steal this Gentleman's watch.
The Prisoner. I didn't, Sir.
Alderman Juggins. Yes, you did.
The Prisoner. No, I didn't
Alderman Juggins. I Bay you did, Sir.
The Prisoner. And / say I didn't.
Alderman Juggins. The Witness says you did, too.
The Prisoner. Well, I say I didn't; leastways, not intentionally.
He was dashing by me—my thumb caught in his watch-chain, then
I found his watch in my hand, and the question simply resolved
itself into this—should I return the watch at once, or borrow it for a
short time. But I hadn't a chance of doing either, for I was given
into custody.
Alderman Juggins (to the Witness Skimmers). What have you to
Bay to that?
Witness. Simply, yer Honour, that it isn't true.
Alderman Juggins. But he swears it is.
Witness. Pardon me, your Honour, but the Prisoner does not
swear it. He isn't on his oath.
Alderman Juggins. Then why isn't he?
Mr. Guffin (the Chief Clerk). Prisoners are never sworn. Sir.
Alderman Juggins. What a monstrous iniquity! All this needs
reformation. (To Prisoner.) Well, I will give you the benefit of
the doubt, and fine you forty shillings or a month.
Mr. Guffin (the Chief Clerk). Ileally, Sir, you can't fine a Prisoner
for stealing a watch.
Alderman Juggins. Well, I'm not going to let him off.
Mr. Guffin (the Chief Clerk). You misunderstand me, Sir. You
must either remand him, sentence him to imprisonment with hard
labour, or send him for trial.
Alderman Juggins. Nonsense; it's a waste of time. I shall fine
him. He's evidently very sorry.
Mr. Guffin (the Chief Clerk). There are more Witnesses, Sir.
Alderman Juggins. We don't want them. I've had quite enough
of this case. Call on the next.
Blount Cutler, described as a Solicitor's Clerk, was charged with
assaulting Frank Sellter.
Mr. Sellter, who appeared with a black eye. said: He regretted
to say that he was the cause of the quarrel, and he wished to with-
draw the charge. The Defendant was not the least to blame in the
matter; in fact, he had acted with great forbearance.
Alderman Juggins. But he gave you that black eye?
Witness. I brought it on myself.
Alderman Juggins. Nonsense! The case must "go on.
Witness. I decline to give evidence. It's not a felony.
Alderman Juggins. Perhaps you '11 teach me my duty?
Witness. I would, only I haven't time.
Alderman Juggins. How dare you?
Defendant. I say, wake up! Don't keep me fooling about in this
dock all day. You '11 have to discharge me.
Alderman Juggins. How dare you indulge in this insolence?
What do you know about the Law?
Defendant. A great deal more than you. I am a Solicitor's Clerk,
while the whole of your life has been devoted to the manufacture of
tin-pots and candlesticks.
Alderman Juggins. I shall commit you for contempt of Court.
Defendant here burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.
When he recovered, he said:—You can't commit for contempt in a
police-court. I thought every fool knew that.
Witness. You can take a summons out against him for abuse.
Alderman Juggins. Be quiet. You 're both a couple of blackguards.
Witness. I shall take a summons out against you, if you 're not civil.
Alderman Juggins. I shall consult my colleague, Alderman Sir
Ribbon Cordon.
Defendant. He knows no more about the Law than you. Look
here, you must discharge me, and, in return, I '11 send you my little
handbook, entitled Every Man his Own Magistrate; or, Law in the
Back Drawing-Boom.
Witness. Well, I've an appointment in the City, and can't wait
any longer. [The Witness left the Court.
Alderman Juggins (to Mr. Guffin, the Chief Clerk). How much
can I give him?
Mr. Guffin (the Chief Clerk). Nothing, Sir. You must discharge
him.
Alderman Juggins [to Prisoner). You're a blackguard, Sir; and
not fit to remain in this Court. Be off!
REPLY FOR RAMSGATE.
(To the Editor.)
Sir,—" What's this I hear,"—as Truth generally commences a
paragraph when it's going to give a startler,—What's this I hear
about the health of Ramsgate? KRowmgsomethingabout it, indeed
almost as much as the excellent Vicar, Mr.Whiting (most appropriate
name, says Mr. Joe Miller Junior, for a sea-side Clergyman with
the cure of soles—eh! just the plaice for him, &c, &c.) I can confi-
dently indorse the Vicar's assertion, in his letter to the Times,
April 10th, and declare that the statements as to the present
insalubrity of Ramsgate have not the slightest fact to found them-
selves upon. Being unsupported they must drop.
On a fine morning—and when is it not fine at Ramsgate ?—the sea
is of a Mediterranean blue, the fishes sparkle in the sun, the dolphins
play, the birds in their little nests agree, and the hearts of the lands-
men go out to the Mermaidens on the rocks, and to the merry mariners
in the calm and sunlit offing. Light-hearted are the Light-ship-
mates, the temperature is better than on the Riviera, and days and
nights less treacherous. Then at night—if night it can be called
where there are such stars and such constellations, and a Royal
Crescent Moon shedding its gentle rays on the gothic towers, gabies,
and garmoyles—no, gargoyles—of the Welby-Pugin West Cliff—
Ramsgate is simply delicious, balmy, beautiful!
Whoever may he the envious or jealous Other-Seaside-place person
who has dared to fabricate these damaging stories, his attempt to
blacken the fair fame of Ramsgate has been whitewashed out by a
most decided WnrTiNG. In fact, so enticing is the Vicar's report,
that I should not have been surprised had his initials not been T. B.
Whiting, but I. N. Whiting, for as our friend "Robert" would
say, "I never new a more in-witing spot." However, the Vicar is
right—and so am I. And remain, yours sincerely,

Whim without phrensy, wit without offence,
On the world's stage are welcome, as on that
Behind the footlights! Sharp and solid sense
As ever in the Councillor's ermine sat,
Combined with what the gayest motlev covers.
Bright mockery, quaint conceit, ana word-play wild,
Mingled in him, most loyal of Stage-lovers,
Whose spirit, caustic yet unvenomed, mild,
Bore tartness as the luscious damask rose
Bears its subacid pungenoy. Men saw
In him no parasite of rank; he'd pose
As no allowed stiff-strutting social daw.
Weaver of gay word-whimsies, wearer too
Of the right comic mask but seldom donned.
His coarse-husked tender cookney tradesman drew
The Town for years. Not his the reaoh beyond
To life's perennial laughter-spring, perchance,
Tapped by so few; but Miadlewick may stand
Against a hundred puppets cribbed from France.

And heard his swift-sprung, mad, spontaneous quips,
Will sorrow to remember that no more

then stood a bottel of wine to a frend of ours who's a lawyer's clark, if a
Lawyer can be a frend, to git him to egsplain to us all about the Bill. We alius
gits our wine at holesale prise, and rayther thinks as we nose wot's wot as
regards wine. It fact it has crossed our minds more than wunce, that, if this
owdaoious Bill passes, we mite turn Wine Merchants. Kodert, Brown, & Co.
wooden't look so bad over our Seller, and the nat'ral arangement wood be as I
shood taste the Wines and Brown shood sell 'em. But this is buy the whey.
Our lawyer frend says as how it's the most egstrawnery BiU as he ever
seed! Wot it says in wun place it unsays in another, wot it gives here it takes
away there, and amost all the clawses pints to some other clawses that skratches
'em all out, so to speak. Take for instans the most himportent pint of all, The
horsepitalluty of the New Copperashun, witch of course was the fust thing as
we looked for. It says as the New Copperashun may, like the Old One, spend
their money in entertaining distingwished persons, but whose to deside who is
a distingwished person enuff to be so entertained? In oourse they '11 take jolly
good care not to draw the line too sewerely, and, if they keeps a sharp look out,
they '11 never belong at a loss for a distingwished Jest or two.
I think praps I may olame sum credit for this, from a nint I gave Sir Wer-
dant won day, wen he was a chaffing me over his dinner about his cumming

so he ewidently did do, and we sees the seekwell.
If there's one Gent as I pities more than another, it's

who nose where it's right for to stop, or what will be
left P It's like changing a soverain, how it all seems to
melt away, and, as the Poet says, leaves not a rap behind!
According to what we learns from our lawyer trend, the
30th of April next year will be won of the sollemest and
most affectingest days as the Sun ever shined on—and it
don't shine werry often—in all the grand history of the
grand old Copperashun! On that fatal day, the Court of

NEW NOTION.
Last Saturday, at the Birmingham
Police Court, when the suspected
Dynamiters were brought up for fur-
ther examination, Mr. Avery, one of
the Magistrates, is reported to have
asked Mr. Farndale (appearing for
the Crown), "whether, if another
remand were granted, tie would be
able to proceed seriously with the
case?" Why "seriously"? Had
Mr. Farndale been treating the
matter as a joke np to this time P or
is there a comic way as well as a
serious way of conducting a Prelimi-
nary Inquiry before a Magistrate a'
Birmingham, and Mr. Farndale was
only being called upon to name which
style he meant to choose, and name
it beforehand, so that the Magistrates,
if he selected the comic method, might
come prepared with repartees, puns,
and sparkling witticisms? Odd ques-
tion, not usually put by every—no,
we mean, by Avery Magistrate.
BARTER EXTRAORDINARY.
We see strange things occasionally
in the Exchange and Mart, but we
never saw anything stranger than
the following from the Daily News:—
WANTED.—"Would a Family GIVE
a BED to a French Youth in
return for FRENCH CONVERSATION,
near Bond Street? References exchanged.
We have heard of giving new
lamps for old ones, but the ex-
changing of feather-beds for French
phrases, conversation for counter-
panes, and Parisian accent for
pillows, strikes us as being a decided
novelty. Besides, why should the
presentation take place " near Bond
Street"? Why by a family? We
to being altogether puzzled.

AFTER THE EASTER HOLIDAYS.

A COLLOQUY.
Scene— The Premier'§ Study. Enter Mr. Bull.
Mr. Bull. It is always nnpleasing for me to have to break in upon
the repose, especially the Easter repose, of a—ahem I—a Sick Lion, if
I may borrow from our mutual friend, Sir William Habcoubt. I
come, Mr. Gladstone, to rouse you—not from your bed, but from your
lethargy; to bring you, not your shaving implements, but your hot
water. I am pleased to observe, from that flashing eye, that you are
already aroused. Your mane—to cany on the leonine metaphor—
stands erect, almost as though Northcote himself were opposite yon.
Mr. Gladstone. I assure you, Mr. Bull, I am full of energy. My
thoughts are preternatnrally active at this moment.
Mr. Bull (heartily). I am glad to hear it. That is what the
country wants. Everybody calls on you to do something.
Mr. Gladstone. And I will do something, too.
Mr. Bull. Oh, this is glorious! But then / always knew yon
were sure even if you were slow. You have come to a definite deter-
mination r You have decided to take action at once P
Mr. Gladstone. At once. I have come to a grave determination
on an important question.
Mr. Bull. Then there is an end of my anxiety! It is not too late—
I will not believe it is too late—to rescue the heroio Gordon from
the—ahem!—Berberous savages of the Soudan, to——
Mr. Gladstone. Gordon! the Soudan! Yon misunderstand me.
Were you under the impression that it was with reference to the
Khartoum difficulty I had come to a decision P
Mr. Bull {suddenly becoming low-spirited again). Why, I thought
—I certainly was hoping Did not you say that you had "just

NOTES FROM "NIBBS."
On The Very Flat-Iron-Mattel; or'All's Well that Endi in Smoke;
i.e., the new Play at the St. James's.
Last Thursday a piece, not quite new, "from the pen," hut not the
"brain." of Mr. Pinero, was produced "under the Direction of Mr.
Hake" at the St.
James's, the prin-
cipal characters
being played by
Mr. and Mrs. Ken-
dal.
It is called The
Ironmaster, and
really considering
that the title of the
French piece is Le
Maitre de Forges,
this is not sucn a
very bad transla-
tion. Claire the
heroine is very
nearly as objection-
able a person as
the virtuous Cla-
rice, in Tragedy
and Comedy, who
enticed her stout
friend the Kegent,
Babnes d'Or-
leans, into a trap,
where he was
caught and killed
the cards that her

The Iron-Master; or. The Master of Ironv—" chez
Philippe."
by her worthy husband,—though it was on
worthy husband might have been killed by the Stout Party,—
which, however, was quite a matter of pile ou face to Clartce.
Claire de Beaupri in The Ironmaster is not quite so bad as this. She
is a young lady who, with an almost supernatural fidelity (according
to the account of her given by her friend or Married Sister,—which-
ever it was I couldn't quite make out,—called Baronne de Prefont),
is devotedly in love with the Due de Bligny (a young gentleman
with a pale face and black olothes, something between an undertaker,
Mr. Boucicault as a Vampire, and Mr. Irving as a Corsican Brother
in Paris), and swears that, when she loves any man, she loves him
for ever and ever, Amen ("methinks theilady doth profess too much"),
and then, within a few minutes after this declaration, on hearing from
a. very theatrically-mannered and unpleasant young person (there are
several young persons in this play,—and nearly all titled, whioh is
just as it should be at the St. James's, you know)—a Mademoiselle
Ath&ndiss Moulinet—(0, Mr. Pinero, under the Direction of Mr.
Hake," why didn't you translate the name literally and call her
"Miss Athenaiss Chocolatestick," for that is it, her father being a
chocolate manufacturer. What real French humour! But passons.')
—whom Claire has no reason to like or to believe, but very much
the contrary,—I say on hearing from this theatrical young person
that she herself—this very Miss A. Chocolatestick—is going to
marry Ievlng Junior or the Vampire Duke, the supernaturally
faithful and devoted Claire deolares that she won't allow it to go
forth to the world that she was jilted by the Undertaking Noble-
man, that she will not live and die a spinster, but that she will
bestow her hand and her fortune on a man she dislikes (for the
reason that the historical person, name unknown, disliked Dootor
Fell), hut who, as an Ironmaster, and beneath her in the social
scale, has had the audacity to admire her at a very respectful dis-
tance, and, through an agent, to "ask Mamma,"—and for these two
offenoes she is going to punish him, and at the same time show the
faithless Vampire-Duke, that, to put it colloquially,—'' if he wouldn't
have her, somebody else would be only too glad of the ohance."
So the unfortunate Ironmaster has a nice time of it. CMire insists
on dragging the bridal party, the Ducal Undertaker and all, out at
midnight in a bitter North-East wind, to see her married to the Iron-
master in a cold draughty Church, the whole lot, including the
gloomy Vampire-Duke, returning all together (like the guests in the
IVediting March) to the house, to find no supi>er, nothing to eat,
nothing to drink, and only their carriages and cabs ordered to take
them away as quickly as possible, leaving Mr. and Mrs. Ironmaster
alone, when, for the first time, Mr. Ironmaster finds out that he
has caught a Tartar, or rather that a Tartar has caught him; and
there is, then and there, on the spot, such a regular row—there's no
other word for it—that the sheeplike, confiding Ironmaster, is from
that moment a changed man, and, from being a very Flat-Ironmaster,
he becomes a very sharp Master of Irony. The row ends by Claire
being sent to her room, like a naughty young person as she is, while
Philippe Derblay, the Flat-Ironmaster, beats nis forehead, staggers,
tumbles against the mantelpiece, and on to an uneasy-chair, where,
presumably, he is going to spend the remainder of the first night of
this oheerful Honeymoon. Nice person, Mrs. Claire! Oh, very !_
Then, to make a long story short—and this might be done with
advantage on the St. James's stage, where, "under the Direction of
Mr. Hake," some good cuts in the dialogue might yet be made—
Claire, the ever faithful, perpetually followed about throughout her
married life by all the guests who had been asked to the wedding,
including a Barong, a General, and the Undertaking Duke,—still
forcibly reminding me of the Wedding March,—becomes, after a
year of it, intensely bored by the monotony of her existence among
this set of waxwork figures, and developes a dog-in-the-mangerisE
kind of jealousy for her nusband.
The Undertaking Duke, who gets more and more vampirish and
more and more sulky—(and very naturally, on account of his having
absolutely nothing to do except to slide about like Irving, with a
sneaking would - De - seducery - manner towards Clairet and then
scowling in corners and doorways with a melodramatic "but-a-
time-will-come-no matter" sort of expression on his face)—as the
play proceeds, is at last forced by Claire to challenge her husband,
which he is only too glad to do, as up to now his line has been one of
iron-masterly inaction,—and then it suddenly occurs to Claire, whose
impulses are so delightfully mischievous, and whose afterthoughts
exhibit such charming naivete", that her husband, to whom she is
now as devotedly attached as she was a short time ago to the Duke
(which isn't saying much, perhaps),—will run a considerable risk of
being shot dead by such a dead shot as the Undertaking Duke,—who
would probably make something by providing his victim's funeral,
including hat-bands, scarves, gloves, hearse and horses, &c. Claire
foresees that if her husband is killed, she won't be any better off as a
widow—(for the Duke having married Miss Chocolatestick, her chance
is gone in that direction) than she was as a spinster,—as it is more than
likely that the Ironmaster (who, having shown himself so obstinately
determined, may now be called " The Pig-Ironmaster ") would leave
his money to his sister, who loves him, instead of to nis wife, who
doesn't,—and so she first of all tries to upset and demoralise the
unhappy man, who has been sitting up all night before the duel, and
then, failing in her attempt at preventing him from fighting, she
runs out after him, catches them up (they had evidently selected a
favourite locality in the park-like grounds well known to pic-nickers),
and dashes in between the combatants just as they both fire, and both
having aimed at a crow have apparently killed a pigeon,—for down
falls Claire with a shriek, and among a critical audience there is a
strong inclination to deliver the verdict of " Serve her right."
The Undertaking Duke, after hearing the Doctor pronounce Claire
out of danger, walks hurriedly away, evidently dissatisfied, from an
undertaking-businesspoint of view, with the morning's work. His
occupation is gone. Exit Duke.
After posing as a dying woman so as to bring her husband on his
knees to ner, Claire gets up again, as right as the nimble ninepenee,
the pair embrace, and the Master of Irony is firmly ironed in Hymen's
fetters by the crafty Claire. For she ts crafty; and I am not now
perfectly clear that the whole plot wasn't " a put-up job," a regular
"plant, artfully arranged between Claire, the Undertaking Duke,
and Miss Chocolatestick to get the Ironmaster's ooin into their pos-
session, and go gambling all together at Monaco. But supposing this
not to he the case, and supposing it all genuine, then the piece should
have ended not in smoke, as it does now, but very differently, and
poetio justice should have been dealt out to those who really deserved

it, and whom I have not mentioned here, as, though they work the
machinery of the piece, they are but apparently subordinate parts;
and to my mind herein is the consummate Art of this play. There
is an old family lawyer, one Bichelin, who calls the Duchess "Me-
darm," and the Ironmaster " Dear Boy," and who would lose all his
aristocratic clients were he to display such insolence towards them

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
as he does to the Due, and it is this old babhler who is the first to
suggest the marriage of .the Ironmaster with Claire when the latter
has lost her fortune; he it is who brings the formal proposal to
Claire's mother, and he it is who, as the Ironmaster's agent and
friend, bids for her hand in this "Clare Market." Bechelin is
primarily responsible for the match. On the other hand, there
is a comic man, a retired Chocolate-maker (same sort of person
as Mr. David James played in Our Boys—only with none of poor
H. J. Byron's fun in it), who lends the Duo money, and entraps him
into a marriage with his daughter, and so detaches him from Claire.
On his shoulders (for himself and daughter) is the second weight of
responsibility. The old Duchesse, Claire's mother, is not blame-
less; but she is a weak old creature, and would be as utterly unin-
teresting as such a conventional character must be, but for the
excellent acting of Mrs. Gaston Murray. So the end should have
been a quarrel, easily got up by Claire, between old Bechelin and
Mr. Chocolatestick, finishing with a duel, in which they should have
killed each other.
Mrs. Kendal played admirably throughout, but in trying to
strengthen what she must have known from the first moment of
choosing it was the weak point of the piece, that is, the motive of
the heroine's action, she "professes" so much too much, that by her
display of loathing for the victimised Ironmaster, and by her expres-
sion of utter contempt for the Duke, she misleads the interested
spectator, who begins to think that the English Adapter has been
compelled to omit the real motive of action which had probably
existed in the original. The dialogue, when the newly-married
daughter takes leave of her mother in the Second Act, lends itself to
this supposition: but the supposition is wrong. The heroine's motive
at the St. James's, London, is the same as at the Vaudeville, Paris,
and is contemptibly weak.
Mrs. Kendal's acting is enough to carry the piece. Like one of
Mr. Gladstone's splendid oratorical efforts, it kindles immediate
enthusiasm, but it will not stand the analysis of thoughtful criticism.
It is Art, admirable Art, but it is the best Art used for an unworthy
purpose, namely, creating sympathy for a character who does not
deserve it.
The piece is put on the stage with such a total disregard of expense,
that everyone has a brand-new hat, except the Lawyer. Mr. Kendal
carried his very much en evidence (a la Francois), and his right
hand was so entirely occupied with it during the First Act, that he
had to fhnke hands with his left. The effect of these hats (six of

Act IV.—Just before the Duel. Coming to Hattention.
'em) in the duel scene; when they all go off at once, before the pistols
do, is extremely striking. The audience need not be alarmed. There
is no danger,—and on the first night the piece went off as well as did
the hats and pistols.
Why Mr. Kendal, who played the part as well as he will ever
play it, should have chosen this for himself, is a puzzle,—except
that having risked the weak motive, this chance might be thrown in
as well, and the situations be left to do the rest. The St. James's
partners are, I think, pretty safe in their speculation with this version
of Le Maitre de Forges. That The Ironmaster -mil be an excellent
servant for this Season, and that the theatre-going uncritical publio
will, under the spell of Mrs. Kendal's acting, accept Claire at Mrs.
Kendal's valuation, is the conscientious opinion of
Your old friend, Nibbs.
P.8.—I haven't heard much lately about the "Elevation of the
Drama," but what is just as good, and, speaking popularly, much
better than the Elevation of the Drama, is the Seduction of the prices
for seeing the Drama, which has been commenced at the Empire
Theatre, Alhambra, and Her Majesty's. The last-mentioned House,
with Tom Taylor's first-rate play, The Ticket-of-Leaiv Man, is, 1
hear, crowded at their new prices. Shall we return to the five-shilling
Stall and four-shilling Dress Circle P Still with " No fees?"

Criterion Company could give the Palais Royal Company long odds
in any piece now, and beat 'em easily. The Empire Tncatre is some-
thing to see—but I must defer my note on this till I have recovered
from the first effects of its magnificence. The Globe, where a short
time ago things began to look'Tatherl" dicky," is flourishing, as I
hear, with a new bouffe Opera called Dick. Miss Kate Vaughan's
Country Girl and Ntta's First at the Novelty for next week. The
Novelty Baby is doing very well —growing into a very fine child, I
hear. I should have .visited the infant long ago had I not seen an
advertisement quoting the Saturday Review's favourable opinion of
the fun of this farcical comedy. A Sabbath-Day Reviewer extolled
the merits of the pantomime at Her Majesty's, and—but absit omen!
PP.S.—Mr. Bancroft's Manifesto about the forthcoming revival
of The Bivals has just been issued. He announces that he and
Mr. Pinero accept the responsibility of being Sheridan's joint-
editors. They will have incurred a very grave responsibility if they
haven't reduced Julia and Faulkland,—yes, reduced them abso-
lutely to powder, which will be quite in keeping with the period.
Mr. Bancroft informs the Public that the moment he had deter-
mined on this revival he at once told his scenic artists " to go to
Bath." Mr. Bancroft and Mr. Pinero (temporarily escaped from
being " under the Direction of Mr. Hare ") have also been staying
there, in order to go through a course of waters and baths; and the
Manager has brought back a supply of the real Bath waters, bottled,
which have been dealt out to all the Actors and Actresses concerned
in the revival, regularly every morning at 10-30, half-an-hour beforo
rehearsal. Gad so! Odds Pump and Tea-rooms, but I wish 'em
Changing their Note.—We English are getting along as
Musicians. Two Operas by English Composers have recently achieved
marked success abroad. At Hamburgh Mr. Stanford's Savonarola
is a triumph. The original libretto is, we were rather astonished to
hear, by our amiable and accomplished confrere, Mr. Gilbert
a Beckett. We say " astonished "because we had no idea he was
in Hamburgh bringing out Operas when he ought to have been en-
gaged on but should this meet his eye, we Deg to say that if he
will return to his work and send us those promised Bide-splitters, all
will be forgiven, and no further allusion shall be made to Savonarola.
This en passant. But the recognition of the merits of English com-
posers by foreigners foreshadows a time when at all the Grand Opera-
Houses of Europe it will be the thing for the singers to drop Italian
and assume English names; and we shall'actually meet with none
but English names in the programme of a State Concert at Bucking-
ham Palace !" Prodigious 1!"

Can nobody induce the Honourable Member for Bridport to apply

in wholly blocking Bills in the House of Commons, and by so doing
bringing a lot of the business of the country to a standstill.

_ On Conversation.—The basis of all conversation is Flat Contradic-
tion. The flatter and the stronger the contradiction, the more
certain and secure is the basis on which the structure of Conversation
is to rise.
Where there is no contradiction, "nothing more need be said,"
and consequently there and then is an end of all conversation.
The word conversation in itself expresses and implies an assertion
of a fact and a denial. It is compounded of two Latin words,
"verso" to turn, and "con" together, and means, therefore, two
people turning together, or having " a turn at one another," or a
set-to." Were everybody to agree with everybody else, it is
evident that there would be no matter for discussion, and, therefore,
no real conversation.
Persons in love, who are, for the time being, in perfect agreement
with each other, never converse. They can't. It is from this
* The subject and title of these papers bear some resemblance to Messrs.
Griffith and Farran's natty Utue republication of the selections from
"Lord Chesterfield's Letters to his Son, 'entitled Manners and Speech, but
a careful comparison will establish the dissimilarity. We do not quite gather
from the information given us by our learned and most trustworthy Compiler
if Lord Jesterfield is still living, nor do we remember having met with the
title in the Peerage. These, however, are mere details in no way affecting
the merit of the selections which we now, for the first time, have the satis-
faction of placing before the Public.
universally-observed fact that in every language may be found the
significant proverb, "Silence speaks consent," ».«., where all agree
there is, as we have said, no conversation.
A knowledge of Human Nature is absolutely necessary for the
cultivation of good manners, and for getting oneself generally liked in
all sorts and varieties of Society.—This is an extensive subject, but
its study will well repay the most attentive perusal:—
Rules and Advice.—In whatever society you may be, a moderate
share of penetration will enable you to find out everybody's weak
points. 1 ou may not hit upon them all at once, but make your own
private list, and then try them all round. Enter any room as though
you were a general practitioner called in to pronounce on everybody's
ailments. You do not want to set their tongues, but only hear how
they use them. You can feel the pulse of each one discreetly.
How to make yourtelf Agreeable with a Nouveau Miche.—Be play-
fully familiar. Lower yourself to his level; so as not to appear
Eroud of your superior birth and training. Ascertain how he made
is money, what was his origin; and, if unable to discover what he
sprang from, you can make a safe guess in supposing him to have
been a scavenger, a dustman, or as boy engaged in sweeping out an
office (many illustrious men who have discharged the highest offices,
may have themselves been discharged from the lowest offices for not
having kept them clean and tidy), and on this supposition you can at
once address him, and proceed to compare his former state of abject
poverty with his present apparently inexhaustible wealth, a subject
that must afford rum the greatest possible pleasure, especially in a
mixed company. You will take care to recur to this topic at every
possible opportunity—nay, you will exhibit your tact by inventing
suoh opportunities; as, for instance, when seated at one end of the
table, and the millionnaire at the other, you will wait for a pause
in the conversation to call out loudly, " Sir Thomas!" Should he

be so ill-bred as not to answer to his name on the first time of ask-
ing, you will do well to repeat the summons in such a tone as will
command immediate attention. Then, when he returns, with exces-
sive pomposity, "EhP I—er—beg your pardon, Sir—I think you
spoke to me,r'—you, having, of course, the entire company with
you, will nod to him affably, and reply, " Yes; I did. I was going
to ask you a question." To which he will bow gracefully, and lend
a more or less willing ear. Having thus secured him, you will say,
"I was only going to ask you, Sir Thomas, if you didn't start in
life as a secondhand bird and dog fancier's errand-boy in the
Seven Dials, that's all?"
You needn't wait for his answer, as, presuming you are well up in
your subject, you can go on pleasantly, and with an air of tender
interest to ask him, " Do you ever see Old Bill Bloker the rag-and-
bone man, who was just round the corner by your shop P" And then
you can express your curiosity as to what became of Old Bill's pretty
daughter, on whom "—here you can throw a wink at the company
— you were rather sweet, Sir Thomas, in those days,—boy-like,
for she was seventeen, at least, and you couldn't have been more
than twelve."
This is only a single illustration of the rule, which you can develope
to its utmost extent in ordinary everyday practice. You will get
yourself immensely liked, and universally respected, and no dinner-
party or social gathering of any kind will be considered perfect
without your presence. Human nature is the same everywhere,
and you must adapt yourself to your compart;/, not by a servile imi-
tation of their style, which in them is possibly an affectation, but by
judiciously introducing whatever element is the most opposite to their
habits and demeanour.
Conversational Contrasts.—If you find yourself in a society
where everyone is lively, you must introduce the element of severe
gravity. Has Nature made everything green or sky-blue? No.
Nature abhors a monotone, and, therefore, you will be but acting on
a natural principle, which the artificiality of Society has obscured,
when you introduoe, as I have said, the element of severe melancholy
gravity into a lively and merry party.
jRuie.—Be rollicking with the dismal, sprightly with the dull,
wild with the sedate, uproarious with the quiet, inharmonious with
the musical, seriously scientific with the frivolous, slow with the
fast, fast among the slow, an Agnostio with Theists, a Theist with
Agnostics, stupid with the talented, and talented with the stupid.
Example No. 1.—Suppose yourself at a lively party of wits, or
wags, where each man has his good story to tell, his joke to make, and
his quip to utter, and where all are ready to laugh on the slightest
provocation. It will be for you to adjust the balance. Do not hesitate
as to the course you are called upon, in the true interests of Society,
to pursue. Take your place at the table, and when the first jest has
set the table in a roar, do you preserve a decorous silence. Then,
when the laughter is finished, request to know what had bo greatly
amused the company. The jest is sure to be imperfectly repeated by
the host, who will be at once corrected by one of the guests, who, in
his turn, will be corrected by the perpetrator of the jest himself, and
by the time it has been accurately repeated to you, you will have
had the satisfaction of observing that the original concocter of the
joke is disgusted at the evident inability of those who had pretended
so much enjoyment from it to repeat it correctly, or even a part of it.
On its repetition to you, no one will hare laughed a second time,
which in itself is sufficient proof that it was not worthy of their
approval on its first utterance. You will not move a muscle, but
will simply and sadly bow your head, with such an air of sad resig-
nation as would characterise your manner had you received the
confirmation of some melancholy news for which you were not
entirely unprepared.
Thus, you will have judiciously introduced the element of serious-
ness into a party where the evening would have been frittered away
in thoughtless, careless witticisms, and in the telling of useless tales,
and would have lasted, but for your well-timed action, until the
small hours of the morning. In view of this possibility, take the
greatest care to be the last to leave, having, on your arrival, bestowed
your hat and coat in some safe place where you can find them, but
where nobody else can.
[This interesting subject, with rules, exceptions, and examples, will be
resumed next week, and continued until further notice.]
Vote Straight.—Yes; but be always careful to take a right aim.

THE TOWN.
I.—Cheapside.
I snro the Town! Furl, Muse, your plumy wing!
'Tis not our present task to soar or flutter;
Our ways are" not by the
Pierian Spring,
But muddy pavement and
malodorous gutter.
Not sylvan shades, but
urban slums I sing;
Shopdom's ©old shibboleth
your lips must utter
If you'd attend your er-
rant votary, Madam,
Into the realms of Mam-
mon and Macadam!
Nature is no road-maker.
Her large plan
Gives ocean wastes and
wooded wildernesses,
The rest she leaves to the
riath-finder, Man,
Who in that way has com-
passed some suocesses.
Bumble-ruled Bull, the
new Boeotian,
However, here as else-
where, makes sad messes,
And Summer's morn or
Winter's dreary dusk in
A London Street 's un-
lovely! — ask John
Ruskin!
And yet what panorama of blue hills,
What shadow-flecked perspective of green forest,
Soul's inner sympathies so strongly thrills
As does that strait-walled world of woes the sorest
And joys the wildest, that mad war of wills',
And wits our City shows? Oh, Bard, who porest
O'er little lyrics of the rose and lily,
What make you of Cheapside or Piccadilly?
Cheapside! The Cit's true earthly Paradise,
The dreamer's chill Inferno! Here converge
An unseen world's tumultuous energies;
To trace the forces clashing here, whioh urge
The human horde of atoms, draw all eyes,
And bend all brains, which madly seem to merge
In aimless hustling, were a task immenser
Than ever set to Buckle, Mill, or Spencer.
Here is a quiet entry, placed aside
Some twenty steps from the eternal jostle
Of Trade's tremendous and continual tide.
'Tis hushed; the piping of a prisoned throstle
Is actually heard. With quiet glide,
And face as grave as that of an apostle,
A little man, close-shaved, tight-buttoned, snuffy,
Plods up a spiral stairway dim and stuffy.
He holds—no sceptre, not a sword. Oh no!
But swords and sceptres move at Mammon's nodding;
His gait is shambling, and his pace is slow,
A City clerk he seems, ill-paid, pale, plodding,
But should he those close-clutched blue papers show,
Empires might feel much troublesome foreboding.
Few know to what extent the Great World dances
To tunes set by the fiddlers of finances!
A little bundle of ink-scribbled paper.
And yet who grasps them is the modern Legion;
Of a land's destiny may be the shaper,
Bless a whole race, or blast a fertile region;
A force not weighed by Tadpole or by Taper,
But one the world may some day lay such siege on
As—Juan did upon the hearts of ladies.
And saints fain would on the strongholds of Hades.
Belasco Brown is smooth and plump of limb,
No Cit who ever trod the flags of 'Change
Has whiskers more punctiliously trim;
Boreas at fullest blast could scarce derange
His natty locks. And yet the ogre grim,
Or many-pistolled pirate of the strange
Quaint sheets of youth-loved Skelt, with fierce black frown,
Hath gentler bowels than Belasco Brown.
A Merohant Prince! So thrift-adoring Smiles
Might grandly dub him. Worshipful is Thrift!
Sublime Self-help! A man of many wiles,
And amply dowered with the Midas gift,
Self-made and self-assertive. Golden piles
Reward his thirty years of toil and shift,
Toil—in extracting gain from others' slavery;
Thrift—which, when unsuccessful, men call knavery.
Belasco came to town a smooth-faced boy,—
Some fanoy cunning only hides in wrinkles,—
Men were his tools, and principles his toy;
His voioe, which fatly purrs or gaily tinkles
At will, was ever Subtlety's decoy;
That hazel eye, which cynically twinkles
Above a bargain, then could smile as simply
As good Sir Joshua's cherubs plump and dimply.
Ten years of craft built up a showy trade,
Sold for a fortune to a moneyed noodle,
A slip of rank on whom Belasco played
As plays a showman on a dancing poodle;
And then Belasco, free and unafraid,
With a well-chosen partner, one Fitzboodle,
A subtle Stock-jobber, all gems and chaff,
Became full votary of the Golden Calf.
A cult mysterious save to the initiate
As that of Moloch's self, and thrice as cruel.
That idol of good Christians to propitiate,
How many hearts and fortunes serve as fuel!
Honesty? Faith? Compassion? These might vitiate
Belasco's chances in the desperate duel;
"They 're luxuries," chuckled he. • "I can't afford them."
And most consistently the man ignored them.
Belasco sits at banquets, honoured much
By Statesmen and Toastmasters; he '11 preside
At thunder-throated meetings, and can touch
Hot thousands to acclaim. His nets spread wide,
His baits are many. An incarnate clutch
Is the man's soul, as ruthlessly applied
In gathering prey to satiate want or wish,
As the dread arms of Hugo's Devil-fish.
Only the human octopus full fed
On widow's flesh, on poor men's blood and bones,
On Bourse-bred wars with their unnumbered dead,
And the tax-tortured slaves' unheeded groans,
Is canonised by Cant! The world's nose-led
By the sly tyrants of Shares, Stocks, and Loans,
More than by old Plantagenet or Tudor,
And will be—till the populace grows shrewder!
SUGGESTIONS FOR ALTERATIONS IN THE LUNACY LAWS.
(To the Editor, from an Expert evidently.)
Sir,—No Doctors ought to be allowed to give an'opinion in questions
of sanity. They 're not in it, at least they oughtn't to be. The
simplest plan is this:—If A and B say that C is a lunatio, let D and
E be called in to see if A and B are sane. If D and E cannot agree
—which is a rhyme—call in a jury of specialists from F up to S,
seleoted from the establishments of Bethlehem, St. Luke's, and so
forth. If I want to know whether my coat fits, I call in a tailor.
Judge Jefferies and JuliusCjssar always did. Who's the best judge
of paints? A painter. Who's the best judge of Lunacy P A Lunatio.
There you are. A jury of Lunatics should be called in to decide whether
So-and-So is insane or not. That's My idea; patented: so let's have
no more of this, but send me to the seaside to obtain the benefit'of the
doubt. Tell the Marines to forward an order for my extradition
under the Pneumatic Negotiations Act (Cap. 1, Vic. iii., and long may
she reign!), and, when Icome out, I shall be delighted to give any
further information compatible with my position and dignity. When
I was young I lost a lot of valuable time, and I am now trying to get
it back again by buying up old watches. Do you know any old
watchmen r This is stricuy entre nous. But, my goodness, that was
a bad case, the other day, when the late lamented Julius C&sar and
Judge Jefferies—but 'scuse me—hush!—'tis Oliver Cromwell!! If
he hnds me with my candle alight under the bedclothes where I am
now writing, off goes my head, and I can't do without it, because I've
just bought a beautiful new hat,—so—no more. P.S. I send this b;
the Early Bird. If I were out of this I'd call on you myself ani
explain. Tremble Tyrant!
Yours affectionately,
Alias Ninety in the Shade and More

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NEW MUNICIPALITY OF LONDON.
Guildhall, Mat 1st, 1885.
The first meeting of the Common Council of London was held as
above, the Lohd Matob in the Chair.
There was a very full attendance of Common Councillors, and
much excitement was exhibited in critically examining the beautiful
new Council Chamber that their predecessors, the Common Council-
men of the old and distinguished, but now extinguished, City of
London, had so liberally provided for them. In fact the noise and
hubbub were so great, and the Lord Mayor was so puzzled and dazed
at his unaccustomed position, that nearly an hour elapsed before
business could be proceeded with.
The Lohd Mayor addressed the Court very briefly, and was so
painfully nervous that scarcely a word he said could be understood.
His Lordship then called upon the Town Clerk to state the order of
their proceedings.
The Town Clerk replied that as some considerable doubt existed
as to whether all appointments made by the Provisional Council would
not require confirmation, and as the number appointed was nearly
three thousand, it had better be referred to the Law and Parliamentary
Committee to take Counsel's opinion and report. Referred accord-
ingly, with orders to report forthwith, as no municipal work could be
proceeded with till that point was decided.
It was announced that there were no less than thirty-six deputations
from District Councils with petitions humbly praying to be allowed
to elect their own officers and go on as usual. Their numbers filled
Guildhall Yard, and as the ram was pouring^ in torrents, they were
after long debate allowed to take refuge in Guildhall. Several Coun-
cillors objected to these prayers being granted as they all had
several friends candidates for the various offices. Referred to Dis-
tricts Committee.
The City Architect reported that there were no less than twenty-
eight applications for leases for most important properties, requiring
instant attention. Referred to Leases Committee. The Chamberlain
said that £562,000 of City Bonds would fall due in a month, and
would require great care and attention as regards renewal. Referred
to Finance Committee. He also said the late Metropolitan Board of
Works had informed him that a fresh loan of about Three Millions
would be required to carry out oertain improvements sanctioned by
Parliament. Referred to Committee. Mr. Smith wished to know
how their finances stood. The Chamberlain replied that they had
liberally taken over a debt of about Twenty Millions owing by the
late Metropolitan Board of Works, and a debt of about Six Millions
owing by the late Corporation, making a nice little total of about
Twenty-six Millions of debt with which to begin business. {A laugh
from an old Common Councilman.) Mr. Smith said he didn't see
anything to grin at.
Mr. Mudd (Shoreditch) said it certainly wasn't a sum to be sneezed
at. (" Hear ! ") The Chamberlain asked instructions about making
the necessary " City Rate."
Mr. Jones (Bethnal Green) said he thought there must be some
mistake somewhere. He and his friends had understood that the
money of the late wealthy Corporation would pay nearly all their
necessary expenditure, and that merely a small rate would be neces-
sary, as the twenty-first clause of the Bill said, if the City funds
were insufficient for the purpose. It was only with the view of
getting hold of the fabulous wealth of the old Corporation, and so
largely reducing their crushing rates, that they had worked so hard
to get this Bill. (" Hear, hear ! ")
The Chamberlain said he was afraid that they would find the old
Corporation's enormous wealth fabulous indeed, for they had for
years spent more than their income, and the whole property trans-
ferred to the new Corporation would not reduce their rates more than
a penny in the pound, while he much feared, from what he had
learned of their probable expenditure, those same rates would be
increased at least fifty per cent. (" Oh, oh !" and groans.)
Mr. Robinson (Bermondsey) said as he thought there must have
been a lot of lying somewhere, and if so, he for one hoped as them
as had done it, would get their hides well tanned. (A laugh.)
Referred to Committee.
Mr. Goemond (Whitechapel) wanted to know when they were going
to have their first grand banquet, and how many tickets they would
have for themselves. (" Hear.'") He had read in a very big book
written by a Member of Parliament, so it must be true (a laugh) that
the market price for them was about ten guineas a piece. (JClteers.)
So about four or five would just about suit his book.
The Solicitor'reminded the hon. Member (a laugh) that Banquets
could now only be given to "distinguished persons." (" Oh, oh ! ")
Mr. Mudd, said ne thought as they had been all distinguished by
being elected by such a jolly lot of electors; they was quite
distinguished enough for a beggarly dinner. (" Hear! )
Mr. J. Diddles (Shoreditch) wished to know what payments
would be made to Members of Committees as was done in the old
Corporation.
The Town Clerk said that no members of Committees were paid for
attendances in the old Corporation.
Mr. Robinson: What, more lying? (" Hear.'")
-The whole question of the future Eanitary arrangements of the
Metropolis was referred to the Sanitary Committee. The question of
the housing of the half million poor of London was referred to the
Building Committee. The question of the whole water-supply of
London was referred to the Water Committee. The question of the
future lighting of the whole Metropolis was referred to the Lighting
Committee. During the whole proceedings the noise and confusion
was something incredible. About twenty other important matters
was referred to various Committees, and then, amid shouts of
"Adjourn!" the Lord Mator asked till when P
The Town Clerk said he feared they would have to sit de die in
diem for the next three months at least. (" Oh, oh ! ")
Mr. Mudd protested against any of their Officers presuming to
address them in the French language. Let him explain what he
meant in decent English.
The Town Clerk explained, with great humility, that the matters
they had already referred to various Committees, would, he should
think, require the daily attendance for months to come of every
member; and as each would be on four Committees, he thought they
would have to sit daily from ten till six. (Groans.) And then, so far
as we could make out in the noise that prevailed, the Court adjourned
till to-morrow.
HYDE PARK CORNERED.
The following Minute-paper upon which was based the Report of
the Committee appointed by an Illustrious Personage to consider the
decoration of the New Place at Hyde Park Corner, and decide upon
the fate of the Equestrian Statue of the Great Duke of Wellington,
is now published for the first time.
H.R.H. the Prince of Wales begs to say that having started a
very popular movement, he thinks something ought to be done at
onoe. Statue ought to be removed. Why not to Aldershot P
Colonel Ellis's opinion. "By all means, Aldershot."
The Duke of Wellington's opinion. '' Aldershot or Seringapatam.
At all events, out of sight of Apsley House."
The Earl of Northbrook entirely agrees with His Royal Highness's
proposal that the Statue should be expelled from London.
Viscount Hardinge is for Aldershot,—and so he hopes is the
Statue. Would be willing to submit a design of his own drawing for
a " suitable pedestal."
Lord de L'Isle and Dudlet quite approves of Aldershot. The
Statue might otherwise have been placed in the Park. It might have
been burnished with gold-leaf, and polished up. It would have
looked (as everything should look) nice in the Park.
Baron de Rothschild thinks Aldershot quite the best possible site
outside this best of all possible Metropolises.
Sir R. Wallace, M.P., suggests that it might be turned somehow
into a drinking-fountain.
Sir T. Brasset, while respectfully bowing to the Prinoe's better
judgment, asks if nothing could be done with it as a figure-head to
an iron-clad P
Sir F. Leighton,P.R.A., cannot sufficiently approve of the Prince's
admirable feeling for all that is best in Nature and Art. Aldershot
is as lovely as a Greek child playing in the ambrosial streams of a
never-ending summer. Certainly Aldershot, by all means.
Mr. Shaw-Lefevbe's opinion. "Yes, Aldershot, — and get rid
of it."
Mr. A. B. Mitford considers Aldershot capital. First, however,
the Statue might figure in a Fancy Bazaar; and couldn't it be made
to move a bit, with music underneath,—some air from Offenbach
—might have a variety of 'em to turn on as Duke moves his arm and
horse moves head and tail:—this (with submission to H.R.H.) would
be at all events even more of a change of air for the Statue than
Aldershot.
"A Vert Susceptible Chancellor."—An admirable dish of
"Bacon" has been served up by Dean Church of St. Paul's in Mac-
millan's More-and-Morley Series of English Men of Letters. The
first line of the monograph is its own summary, " The Life of Francis
Bacon is one which it is a pain to write or to read." Francis
Bacon was an arch-dissembler, and a miraole of self-deception. As
Cannie James said, "There were many sides of Bacon, and when his
flattery was more fulsome tfian usual, it was only a fine specimen of
the ' Gammon of Bacon.'" Those who trusted Him he deceived. To
quote Ben Jonson's witty observation, "Bacon is Francis, but
not frank," to which, as it will be remembered, Shakspeabe at once
replied, "True, Ben; and to see him with his friends, by my hali-
dom, 'tis to be looking at 'Bacon and Greens.'" Dean Church has
omitted these anecdotes, with which, we are firmly convinced, none
of the former biographers of Bacon were acquainted.

EARTHQUAKE STARTLERS.
Some curious results of the Earthquake:—We know, from a
report in the P.M. G., that a certain Theatrical Manager, residing in
Russell Square, doesn't rise till after 9-15 a.m., and that his wife has
been in South America, where she was accustomed to Earthquakes..
Mr. Caete, of the Savoy Theatre, was so alarmed that he thought
his Partner, Mr. Gunn, had gone off.
In the Strand numbers of persons who had been taking their morn-
ing draught at various favourite liquidational establishments, rushed
out of these places in so great a hurry that they forgot to pay for the
refreshments they had consumed. This has fixed the tune of the
event on the minds of the proprietors of these places.
We learn also the habits of a Times' Correspondent at Coldharhour
Lane, Brixton. He doesn't get up till past nine; he has a cup of tea
brought to him in bed; he sleeps at the top of the house; and break-
fasts after the rest of the household have finished. This is interesting.
Among other incidents, the Earthquake has resuscitated Cato, who
now appears to be a Clergyman residing at Colchester. Cato wrote
to the Times in English. His habits are apparently more of the Modern
Englishman's than that of the Antique Roman s. Anyone visiting
Colchester may be glad to know that Cato breakfasts at about 9'15,
and lives in a large substantially-built house, with pictures in the
drawing-room, lots of bells, and plenty of lamps.
Neither Mr. Wilson Baeeett nor Mr. J. L. Toole wrote to the papers
disclaiming all connection with the Earthquake; probably, being so
accustomed to Earthquakes, they didn't notice anything remarkable.
It must have been tremendously felt at Westminster, as, after the
Earthquake, Lord Randolph Churchill found himself in the same
lobby with the Ministerial Minority on the Cattle Bill.
Sir Weedant Haecoubt denies that the Earthquke was caused by
his Municipality Bill, though he admits that he hopes London Gov-
ernment is " on the heave of a great change!"
THE WAY OUT OF IT.
In the face, on the one hand, of the enigmatic silence of
Mr. Gladstone in the Commons, and on the other of the mysterious
reticence of Earl Geanville in the Lords, there are, naturally
enough, many sinister rumours rife as to the nature of the, as
yet secret, but significantly foreshadowed means to which the
Government shortly purpose resorting, for the ultimate rescue of
General Goedon. The following, however, may be relied on as
among the most encouraging and accurate:—
1. To send to the surrounding Arab forces, by Parcels Post, a hand-
somely bound copy of the recent debates, with an intimation to General
Goedon that while they are occupied in reading them and being
impressed with the determination and dignity of Parliamentary utter-
ances, he shall effect his departure and come home as soon as he likes.
2. To make arrangements with Messrs. Sangees' travelling Mena-
gerie for a provincial tour in the Soudan on the understanding that
he be allowed to join the Company without a salary, and effect his
escape with them, when their engagement at Khartoum terminates,
disguised as a member of their talented troupe.
3. To offer the Mahdi in cipher a place in the Cabinet.
4. To get Mr. Labouchebe to go alone to Khartoum, for the pur-
pose of explaining to General Goedon the simple and easy way back,
and, if he will undertake the matter, charge hint nothing for his camel.
6. To confer with M. de LESSErs as to the feasibility of eventually
draining'the Nile, and, by so doing, diverting the attention of the
surrounding hordes, within a given oourse of years, from the imme-
diate business at Khartoum.
6. To send Mr. Ashmead-Baetlett, in a sack, with the compli-
ments of the Government to the Sultan, and request his active sym-
pathy and advice.
7. To_ induce Sir William Habcouet to disguise himself as a
pantomime ostrich, and get as near to Khartoum as he can, with a
view to delivering a secret despatch to Colonel Gordon, assuring him
of Her Majesty's Government's support.
8. To wait until the situation becomes a little more complicated

LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business as usual. This time, about The Empire
and The Novelty.
MoN CHER JAC0BI,
You are back again (and anyone in the Stalls, when you 're
conducting the orchestra? can see your back again) at the Alhambra;
but as your time is entirely taken up with The Beggar Student,—
which, I am sorry to say, 1 have not yet seen, but I hear that the
music is bright, and the libretto in a perfect Beattyfied state,—you
have of course been unable to visit the Empire Theatre, which now
adds to the attractions of Leicester Square. I am certain that all
our Directors who may have seen the new place will have told you
ow charmed they were with the magnificence of its arrangements,
its gorgeous saloon, and its delightful nalf-a-crown lounge for sipping
and smoking. You see, cher Jacobi, half-a-crown keeps it so very
select. But when the novelty of the lounge has worn off, and when
there's a duller piece than they've got now, then what a degringoUide
de VEmpire there might be! You at your nice little Alhambra
haven't this to fear, have you? Your house is always full, your
pieces are never dull, and your Directors and Shareholders having
made a good thing out of it altogether, of course wish every sort of
prosperity to your brilliant neighbour.
You know Chilperic, of course. Well, cher Maitre, so do I; and,
between ourselves, I am bound to say, that if I hadn't remembered
the story as given years ago at the Lyceum when M. Mabius first

L'Empire c'est lePay! Great Attraction !—" The Regent Morton " receives
the Mashers in the Lounge of the new impire.
appeared, I should never have gathered it from the performance of
the Opera at the Empire Theatre. It might be Chilperic, or any-
thing. As a matter of fact, it is a Grand. Spectacle splendidly put
on the Stage, with occasional selections of dialogue and song from
something which is, I believe, as often as not Chilperic, and with
Mr. Standing standing on the stage to listen to the comic
foreign music-hall people, who, not naving the advantage that
you possess, cher M. le Chef d'Orcheslrej of speaking English
like a native, employ their own beautiful language, which,
though to the majority it might be Spanish or French, makes a
hit when accompanied by such clever pantomime as that given by
Mons. Paulus (whose whistling is wonderful, and whose handy-
work" in music is a thing to hear and see) and by the Brothers
Tacchi, of whom one sings a song and the other sings an accom-
paniment which is an admirable imitation of some instrument, but
what it is, unless it is a reproduction of the sound of the Hebraic
Lyre or Common Jew's-Harp, I am at a loss to discover. The trick-
change of scene from a camp and moonlit landscape to the ramparts,
is most ingenious and effective. You would be delighted with it.
I fancy you might think the orchestra rather too loud and strong
for the voices; but then you have such a weakness for keeping all
your instruments, specially the brass and wind, pianissimo.
Agreez, cher M. le Chef d'Orchestre, les sentiments de mon estime
le plus distingue, Nibbs.
[To Mr. Charles Wyndham, at the Criterion.)
My dear Wyndham,
You will be immensely pleased, I am sure, to hear of the
success of Nita's First at the Novelty Theatre, a piece quite in the
Criterion-Wyndham School, though it is no more a Comedy, in the
English acceptation of the word, than was Pink Dominoes or Betsy;
but still it is a rattling comic-business-like Farce in Three Acts. But
what does anyone want more than this at 9'30, when laughter aids
digestion? The final hit of the piece is'the introduction of a Real
Live Baby, a beautiful little infant, whose appearance evokes
from the female portion of the audienoe rapturous expressions of
admiration. Specially good is voung Mr T. W. Robertson as the

boy Jemmy at home for the holidays. Miss Susie Vaughan's make-
up is wonderful; she overacts it is true. But they all do this, and
though you, as a steady-going Actor, may complain of it as a fault,
yet I don't think it matters in a rollicking Farce.
The nomenclature is just what you would revel in, being old-
fashioned; as, for instance, Mr. "Irascible" Fizzleton, or Mrs.
"Patience" Fizzleton, or Miss " Prim." This sort of thing belongs
to old comedies, and a nice specimen they've got of that old tie-wig
kind of entertainment (of which would-be critics and laudatoret
temporis acti talk so much and know so little) in The Country Girl,
in whioh Miss Kate Vaughan has chosen to appear as the heroine,
Peggy. In the original it was improper and tedious, and in the
present version it is quite proper enough, but dull. Miss Kate
Vaughan looks charming in the part, but her representation lacks
that archness which should be Peggy's characteristic. Of course you
will be charmed with the Old Comedy, and will lament that the
annoying success of the Criterion pieces should have prevented you
from reviving the works of Ben Jonson, Wychebxy, Congreve,
Dbyden, and Farquhar. Miss Kate will help you, if you don't
ask her to dance. Of course she dislikes the mention of dancing,
just as the Mayor in Pickwick probably didn't relish the reminder of
the "nail and sarsepan business as he got his money by." The
character which you might have considered foolish and introduced
without any high moral purpose, hut which sent me into fits of
laughter, was a Dundreary-hke idiot called Mr. St. George, played
by Mr. E. W. Gardiner. The part is small, but immensely funny.
Brighton for ever! Yours, Nibbs.

THE ITALIAN DERBY.
"O Bella Italia! bella Italia '" writes our Special Correspondent
whom we sent out to Rome regardless of expense. He continues :—
The scene is most impressive. On the UK (a raised portion of the
Campagna) are numerous equipages, from the quarto-in-mano (a
large stage-coach-looking thing drawn by four horses) down to a
two-wheeled vehicle harnessed to a moko, or kind of donkey. The
spectators belong to all classes. In the gentleman with the white
hat and black band and dust-ooloured Ulster no one would recognise
Cardinal Pointo. His Eminence of course does not race in his own
name, as this might give offence at the Vatican. He raoes under
the name of Signor Putta Potom. His colours are, naturally, red
cap and cardinal jacket. The hbra-machi (a class of men who, attired
in grotesque costumes, are prepared to dabble] in sporting finance),
however, know that when "Signor Putta Potoni" takes up a
"course," much money is sure to change hands before the world
becomes an hour older.
Among other noted characters on the Illi are the Svelli (as the
Roman noblesse are called), and the Negroni. These latter are peram-
bulating vocalists, have artificially-darkened faces, and are usually
clothed in the most eocentric costumes. Some of themplay the banjo
(a sort of guitar), and others the boni, or bones. Hark! they are
singing the Grand Republican Hymn known as the Tidi Follollo,
after its Composer.
Besides these vocalists, there are numerous itinerant vendors of
small dolli, which are chiefly used for decorating the hats of the
happy and childlike sightseers.
Besides these there are proprietors of stiki and chochonutti. This
is a purely Italian game. A nut is placed on a staff, and passers-by
are invited to try to knock off the fruit with sticks furnished them at
a certain fixed charge. When the cocoa-nut is knocked completely
away, it becomes the property of the successful marksman.
But the time arrives for the race. The Ubra-machi are hard at
work shouting the odds, the very odds. You hear on all sides
"Tento uno bar uno!" Tento uno sur la Pielda.'" and many other
cries. The Corso is cleared by the Bobbi (an Italian equivalent to our
police) and all is ready for the start. At this moment there is a
roar of laughter as a canino curro (or small dog) is hunted by the
thousands who line either side of the road reservea for the races.
And now every eye is turned towards the starting-point. There
is a shout of f' Qffi! offi!" ("They are away!"), and a great
hush. The denizens of the Grando Standini (a platform frequented
by the richest Italians) watch the race through opera-glasses.
The horses turn a corner, and the myriads of heads change their
position. Then there is a hoarse roar of "Sri comi, eri comi!"
("See, they are approaohing!"), which grows louder and louder,
until the words are undistinguishable in the mighty shout of a vast
multitude. The horses turn again, and now are running home! The
crowd shrieks, "Redo Walkoino; redo walko ino!" and you find
that the contest has been decided.
"When you learn, as you do immediately afterwards, that, in spite
of your thoroughly Italian surroundings, the race has been won by
an English horse, your astonishment is unbounded! *
* We publish it, but we shall have to interview our Special on his return.

SOMEBODY'S DIARY.
[At the marriage festivities of a young Irishwoman in Paris, to which
several " Dynamiters" were invited, an English Detective gained admission,
and made himself so conspicuous by his inquisitiveness, that he was expelled.
-^Daily Paper.]
_ 8 a.m.—Got over_ safely. The French Police passed my boxes of
disguise without difficulty. Rather resented, however, my efforts
to examine everybody else's luggage. Said it was their business,
not mine. Should have argued the point with them, had I not been
otherwise engaged.
9 a.m.—Assumed disguise of a Cardinal, and drove to the church.
Suisse seemed surprised at my appearance, but treated me with
profound respeot. Had to leave my hat in the sacristy. It appears
that a Cardinal never wears his red hat. Sorry I went to the expense
of getting one. However/ Government pays for costume. Insisted
upon reading what the Priest was saying to the "happy pair."
Conducted with much ceremony to the door.
10 a.m.—Hurriedly appeared as a bridesmaid. Insisted upon
entering the carriage or the newly-wedded couple. They seemed
annoyed at my intrusion. Said I only wanted to ask them where
they were going for the honeymoon. They detected my accent, and
caused me to descend (somewhat) rapidly from the conveyance.
11 a.m.—Caught up to the bridal party in the Bois de Boulogne.
Appeared as an old friend of the family—white wig, blue spectacles,
gaiters. Insisted upon kissing the bride. Not being recognised as a
relative, was firmly requested to be off.
12, Noon.—At the restaurant where the wedding breakfast was
ordered. Got up this time as a garqon. "Would sit between bride
and bridegroom, and ask the former whether she had ever been in
Dublin, and what she knew about explosives. Bridegroom extremely
selfish. Wanted all the conversation to himself. Invited to retire.
Complied. To fill up the time, tasted, the dishes and. tested the
champagne. Both excellent. Refused to change a plate, but asked
to see the marriage certificate of the wife of the proprietor. Shown
the door.
1 a.m.—Re-entered in the costume of a gendarme; officially con-
sumed more champagne. Said I wished to see the corks. Caused
some slight disturbance, and went to sleep.
2 p.m. to 9 p.m.—Asleep. Resting; disguised in something or
other, but, of course, not in liquor.
10 p.m.—Again joined the wedding party. Found all the guests
and principals engaged in a ball. Taught the musicians how to
play, instructed the debutantes how to dance, and made a searching
inspection of the supper. All this accomplished in the costume of
the President of the Republic. Everybody courteous, but annoyed.
These democrats are so very difficult to please. Later on, bright
idea struck me. Why not make myself up as the bridegroom?
Carried out the idea. Again asked tie bride about dynamite. Was
getting on capitally when the real bridegroom turned up. Row.
11 p.m.—Kicked out!
UNSEASONABLE.
Yes! though we are in London, and in May,
The Season yet is anything but gay!
With sleet and slush and rain and hail and snow,
The vile Nor'-easter ceases not to blow!
And Spring's Delights, alas! restricted are
To vile neuralgio pains and light catarrh!
For Bhows ana signts we do not care a feather,
And all we think and talk about's the Weather!
But yet I went the other day to see
The rose, azalea, and anemone—
A fine Spring Show, a rare display in all,
By Rumsey, Cutbush, Williams, and by Paul,
And other growers worthy of remark.
Within the Gardens of the Regent's Park.
While fur-clad maidens came and ohatted, and
They shook and shivered to the Life Guards' Band!
While men clad in Ulsters, uncouth, aldermanic,
Thought Spring was a sell at the breezy Botanic!
AN INTERCEPTED LETTER!
April llth, 1884.
DKABE8T Mother,
I have been unable to come to you this Easter, because the
travelling expenses were so very heavy, and the little money I had
remaining, after sending you the trifle for the dear boys' schooling, I
thought it best to keep to guard against contingencies. I am sure
you will think I was right when you read the following advertise-
ment, which I have out out of this morning's Telegraph:—
REQUIRED immediately, an English GOVERNESS, for a family in
Austria. Must speak French fluently, and read music well at sight.
Salary £35—£40. Two years' engagement. Apply, &c.
Does not this look promising? My only fear is that there will he
so many hundreds of applications for the place that my qualifications
will be overlooked. However, I was fortunate last time, when there
were scores of candidates—wasn't IP But then dear Mrs. de Mogyss
(I still feel her death, poor Lady !) only gave £20 a-year, and the
better salary offered in the present instance will be sure to attract
more competitors. But it's a splendid salary! And for two years
certain! So you see, darling, I must keep my little savings to carry
me, if needs be, to Austria.
Ever your loving daughter,
Beatrice.
I open the letter to tell you such good news! I think I shall be
able to come to see you, after all! In another part of the paper from
whioh I ont the other advertisement I found this one:—
HEAD KITCHENMAID WANTED, for West-End Club,
Wages £43. Apply, &o.
Isn't it magnificent! I am sure I am strong enough for the work.
And I really do think I may get it, as kitchen maids are verv scarce.
But you shall hear all about it as soon as things are settled. How
pleased dear Papa would have been had he lived to see it. Do you
ever go to the Reotory now?

(Being Maxims and Extracts from Lord Jester field's Letters.)
No. II.
How to Promote Conversation and Relieve Monotony.—Example
No. 2.—I will suppose that you find yourself one of a party where
the prevailing tone is serious, where a taste for theatricals is con-
sidered a sign of reprobation, where the talk is of sermons, of
religious meetings, and where solemnity and sadness go down arm-
in-arm to dinner. On such an occasion, it is for you, always
judiciously, to introduce the element of light-heartedness and fun.
Now is the time for your merry jest, uttered in a loud tone, and
repeated,—for in such company it will bear repeating,—in a louder,
with such appropriate action towards your neighbours, as digging
them in the ribs, and slapping them on the back, until you brighten
up their wits, and make them happier and pleasanter all round. For
instance, a Lady commences with Oh, Mr. So-and-So, how beauti-
fully the dear Dean brought in that allusion in his sermon. I was
so glad to see how many young men there were present. There
were a g^eat number of Clergymen, too, in the Stalls."
Here is your chance, "les," you can break in, with animation,
"I like to sec the Clergy in the Stalls; it shows they take an interest
in the Stage. There's a good joke told about the Archdeacon of Blum-
ford at the Gaiety on the first night of a new Burlesque. Perhaps
you've heard it; out, if not, it's worth repeating, as it was really
witty, and it sent Nellie Farren and Terry into such fits they
couldn't go on with their parts for some minutes, and I believe John
Hollinoshead,—the Manager, you know,—had to come down and
ask the Archdeacon to leave. Well, this was it—the Arch-
deacon" and here follows the story, a good strong one, of which
you will have a supply by you.
Exceptions to the above Rule. No. 1.—When you find yourself in
company with one or more Invalids, you will not make a boast of
your health; as this only encourages them to bewail their own sad
symptoms, their illnesses, and the disorders which prevent them
from enjoying life as you profess to do. There is no chance of con-
versation in this. It becomes simply a chorus of invalids, a threnody
which is, as Shampeare has said of it, "Very like a wail." Your
method, here, is this: Find out of what ailments each of your com-
panions most complains; what illness or disorder each one prides
himself upon possessing; and, having ascertained these important
details, you must at once declare that you have had each particular
disorder in a far worse manner than any one of them ever had.
If somebody complains of having been, or of being afflicted with it
(whatever it is) in his arms and legs, you have had it in your head
and toes, which they must allow is far more serious, or you can have
had it all over you, which settles the question at once. If someone
has suffered from something onoe or twice, you will take care to have
had it four or five times; and, if that won't do, you must assert that
you are never without it, and are perpetually liable to its return.
Should one of the invalid company declare that there is only one
way of dealing with it, tell him that he is quite wrong, that there
are at least ten ways, and that he has evidently been the victim of
an inexperienced doctor. If he cites the name of someone at the
head of the Medical Profession celebrated for his treatment of this
particular disorder, tell him that this practitioner is old-fashioned,
is " faddy," has too mueh to do, is only a " Specialist," and that his
theories and practice have been entirely upset by the man who, you
will take care to add, is now at the top of the tree, Dr. Heefen-
graffer, of Berlin, or any other name you choose to select. If a
man says he can't go to Berlin to be cured, vou can only shrug
your shoulders, express pity, and re-assert that Dr. Herfengbaffer
is the only man to go to. After this the liveliest conversation will
ensue, and men who came to the party moping, dull, full of aches
and pains, and scarcely able to move hand or foot, will soon.be
gesticulating fiercely, and arguing warmly in favour of their separate
theories, doctors, and treatments; and, if you only keep them at it,
Sou will have done more to restore these invalids to the use of their
mbs (they will kick each other, offer to fight, and throw bottles)
and to the enjoyment; of life, than any number of doctors, or any
amount of medicine and mineral waters.
Exception No. 2.—This is when you are among professional men,
or fervent politicians. Example. You find yourself at a party of
Painters. Do not deprecate their Art, unless they are all of different
schools and opinions, in which case you wiB. return to the rule, and
speak only of music, extolling this Art above all others. But if they

are all, more or less, of one school, or all members of some Society.
—such as the English Academy, or Old Water Colours, or Royal
Piccadilly Waterworks, and so forth,—then you will be careful to
praise everything foreign, asserting that there", is no Art in
England, that English Art is laughed at by all civilised nations, and
that England is unrecognised as having any Art whatever." This
assertion, judioiously introduced, and backed with names of Great
Foreign Artists to be found in Italy, Germany. France, and Russia
(whion your own inventive genius will pro viae for the occasion),
must set them all going, especially should your company chance to
consist of English Musicians and English Actors. In both cases a
really lively evening may be expected.
In such a society, after carefully paying the politest possible
homage to the talent of the professional Gentlemen around you, you
will then proceed to say, in a loud voice, so as to attract attention,
invite discussion and promote conversation,—for you must always
keep this laudable object well in view,—"The Art of Acting (or of
Musical Composition) is entirely lost in England. As an Art, in fact,
there is no such thing existing." There will be a slight movement,
and an attempt at interruption, but you, having the parole, will con-
tinue loudly and positively, " This must inevitably be the state of the
oase where there is no Genius. Take the Drama, there is no Genius
on the Stage; take Music, there is no Genius among our Composers;
indeed, I may say, there are no Composers. The Leading Tragedian,
the Leading Tragedienne, and the Original Composer are as extinot
as the Dodo." Two or three will rush in to reply, but, as they will
all try to speak at once, and will all yield to one another, you. in your
clear, calm, sonorous tones, will continue:—" Where is there any
English Actor, I mean a person calling himself, or, faute de mieux,
allowed to call himself an Actor, who can compare with Coquenabd
of the Francais, De Laumot of the Gymnase, Tetraplni of the
Theatre Spalatro, Pbopoffski of the Imperial Petersburg, or even
with VoEDEiTHOj of the Royalhaus Stockholm, or to be mentioned in
the same breath with the great Diaz of the Imperialos Madrid?"
Here, taking advantage of their being utterly staggered, and
deprecating any interruption by a graceful but authoritative
movement of your hand, you will appeal to the professional guests
with—" Aud just mention the man who can play Hamlet as it should
be played, or name the Actress who can touch Lady Macbeth t"
This will have started them. Having asserted generalities, you must
not be upset by the mention of any one particular instance, but, if
such an one is stated, contradict it flatly. Remember what we started
with, viz., that the flatter and stronger the contradiction the firmer
the basis of conversation. If with Musicians, the same speech will do,
and the same names, only substituting opera-houses for theatres.
*«• Other exceptions will suggest themselves to the mind of the
careful reader, and this style of introduction will be found highly
provocative of the most animated and sustained conversation. Also,
my method is calculated to bring out the best qualities of your pro-
fessional guests, as not one of them will like to say out boldly, "I
am the best Hamlet," or " 7 am the best Composer," as the case may
be, and, consequently, their modesty will be exeroised to such an
extent as will surprise themselves. The Actor who would willingly
deny your assertion as to there being " no one on the English Stage
nowadays who can really play Hamlet as it ought to be played,"
cannot, among his fellow-professionals, boldly declare himself to be
that phenomenon, but will turn to his rival, and observe, "I think
I've seen you play the character to the satisfaction of the audience."
Whereupon his rival will return the compliment, and then they will
argue that someone not present is capable of really playing Hamlet.
But this will at once evoke indignant denial from the rest of the com-
pany, and then you have obtained your object, t. e., of starting con-
versation, and having set the ball rolling, it will go on of itself; and
when the company shall next day calmly consider to whom they owed
their enjoyable evening (for difference of opinion will only have pro-
moted friendship), they will remember that you were present, and be
very sure that your name will be down on all their lists, as among the
first to be invited to any professional social gathering—whether of
Actors, Artists, or Musicians.
The Health Exhibition.—Great progress is being made. Seve-
ral cases of Measles (cured) arrived last week, and were immediately
unpacked. Only one Measle was missing, and this was supposed to
have been given to a boy on the road. The Scarlatinas are a beauti-
ful colour. The processes of curing headaches and stuffing colds
will be very interesting. There will be athletic exhibitions on some
afternoons, consisting chiefly of bilious attacks and defences.

DISCLAIMER
Messrs. Staotord and Gil-
bert a Beckett, Composer and
Librettist of the new Opera,
Savonarola, which has achieved
so great a triumph abroad, wish
to state that thejname of Savon-
arola is not an Advertisement for
any soap. The notion that it was
so, evidently arose from the simi-
larity in costume of the Monastic
hero of this Opera and that of the
two Monks, or Lather-Day Saints,
in the well-known pictorial Ad-
vertisement for a certain soap-
making firm.
Our Royal Visit to the
Royal Institute, Piccadilly.
—We had duly received a card
for the Private View of the Pic-
tures now hanging in the galleries
of the Royal Waterworks, Picca-
dilly, and naturally concluded
that, being "Private," we were
going to have it all to ourselves.
On arriving, last Friday after-
noon, it occurred to us that some-
how the news of our intended
visitmusthave leaked out through
some water-colour channel of in-
formation, as extra police were on
duty at the doors, and the crowd
was something terrific. Evidently
we were expected, and the Mana-
gers of the Royal Institute have
only themselves to blame for the
great disappointment which must
have been felt by their visitors,—
as the thronging of the people on
the staircase and about the doors
(where it was evidently beinjr ex-
plained to them that the Private
View was intended only for our-
selves) was so great that we were
utterly unable to penetrate beyond
the first landing, from which
coign of 'vantage we bowed to the
entnusiastic populace, and made
the best of our way down again.
JULES'S EGYPT.
(A few French Proposals for the Conference.)
That, although the Conference being held in London, a British
Minister must naturally preside over it, French shall be the only
language spoken, and that language be taken only from a Dictionary
devised by M. Jules Ferry. This ingenious lexicon has precious
gems of philosophy like the following:—" Interet (Anglais}. Spolia-
tion. Intehet (Francais), Droit et Honneur. Arabes (d'Alger),
Bandits. Arabes (du Soudan), Patriotes. Tonquin, Gloire. El
Teb, Massacre, honte."
That the regeneration of Egypt shall be immediately placed in the
hands of France, who will at once establish a Mabille at Cairo, and
a Monte-Carlo at Alexandria. Madame Sarah Bernhardt will be
entrusted with the reform of the Harems: and here her well-known
habits of economy are likely to save the Egyptians several miUions
of francs per year; which sum Madame S. B. wiU engage to devote
entirely to Art—as represented by miUiners' bills and costs in law-
courts.
That Egyptian journalism be entirely conduoted by French writers,
profound politicians like Albert Wolff, Jules Valles, Max
O'Rell, being engaged at princely salaries to show the Fellaheen
what progress really is. Tney will be instructed to introduce all
the latest improvements in iUustrated journalism which now adorn
the Paris kiosques; and if they do bring a blush to the cheeks of
passing bayaderes, why, isn't blushing a peculiarly French skin-
disease, and a good deal better than the cholera annuaUy imported
by the wicked English.
That, in order to avoid all provocations to Egyptians to attack
Franoe, or to Frenchmen to attack anybody (they'd scorn the action;
but still it's best to be on the safe side), the English Press be regu-
larly overhauled by M. Jules Ferry, assisted by M. de Blowttz.
AH allusions to French matrimonial scandals, to senatorial squabbles,
to colonial aggrandisement, to wholesale criminal exportation, must
be immediately expunged: they might lead even the meek and mild
and neighbourly Press of Paris to retaliate; and then where would
you be, seeing that one Frenchman has more wit than nine English-
men, as a rule? The Pall Mall Gazette had. better be suppressed at
once, or fused with the Debats, under M. John Lemolnne.
That an English Army be sent to subdue the Soudan, and that the
Egyptian revenues be paid over to an impartial Frenchman—say
M. de Lesseps—as trustee for the Fellaheen.
That the French execute all these articles, except in the matter of
expending money or troops.
STAGE AND STATE.
The delicate consideration for the feelings of our susceptible
neighbours across the Channel, which inspired the Official, whoever
he may be, who acts as Official Licenser of Plays at Cairo, to put his
veto the other day on a performance of Ici on parte Francais, as
"likely to interfere with the Government's polioy for the regenera-
tion of Egypt," evidently knows what he is about. Still, the incident
reveals the existence of an unquestionably critical condition of affairs.
To put up, for instance, Buch an innocent piece of fooling as The
Thumping Legacy, suggestive, as it would be, of the heritage of debt,
about the only substantial thing that Egypt has at the present moment
to bequeath to anybody, would obviously be in the worst taste; while
a performance even of Box and Cox, inevitably suggesting, as it
would, the Sox of Mr. Clifford Lloyd, the Cox of Nubar Pasha,
and the Mrs. Bouncer of Mr. Gladstone, endeavouring to get them
unconsciously to share the same portfolio, could not but fail to give
offence. But the fact is, the real farce in Egypt just now is the
Government itself; and if Mr. Toole could only oe persuaded to go
out and play the principal part himself, there is just a chance it
might enjoy a long run. Downing Street ought to think this over.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 21.—Both Houses met to-
day after the Easter Recess. Not very lively in either. Gladstone
looking' positively ruddy. Randolph a little pale and worn. Pulled
up later when row came on about Wellington Statue. Up to then
sat moody and languid.
"We must look after him," said Wolff, with tear in his voioe.
"He's too reckless of his preoious life. Says he can't sleep at nights.
Offered to put on nightcap, sit up with him and read Jacob Bbight's
letter on the Congo Treaty, or Sir John Lubbock on Proportional
Representation. Said he would not trouble me but wait and hear
Dr. Cameron on Procurator Fiscals in Scotland. This soothed him,
and when Jesse Colltngs took up another hour with speech on
Allotments, Randolph found repose.
House got into Committee at Ten. Shaw-Lefevre pestered with
all kinds of questions about Royal Palaces. Evidently never dared
to have put them himself. Turns out that there are at Royal Mews
230 great Officers of State disguised as stable-boys who have 100
horses to look after. Greatest mystery broods over Hampton Court
Stndhouse. _ Studhouse supposed to result in production, but Labby
asked in vain, "Where are the foals?"
"Must be foals somewhere, don't you know," he said, pressing
the unhappy First Commissioner, "where are they?" Shaw-
Lefevbe nung his head guiltily. Begin to think there _'s more in
this than meets the eye. Labbt, whose theatrical experiences are
sometimes useful, if not lucrative, talks of placarding London with
large bills. First; "Keep vour eye on this." Second (after due
interval); "Where are the Foals?" What with that and getting
Caucuses to work, expects to rouse public feeling on the subject.
Great talk about Duke of Wellington Statue. Sir R. Peel, who,
after all, is on occasion funny, gravely says he wants to have mon-
strosity replaced. On this subject the voioe of Burnley heard.
Peter, as Art-Critic, very good. His description of Lawrence
Statue, especially his dramatic delineation of its "protuberance of
body" brought down House. Business done.—Few Votes taken.
Tuesday.—Morning Sitting in Commons. Towards Five o'Clock
Dodson began to see Government defeat looming through the Fogg
which is his customary companion. Cattle Plague Bill on. Question
of counties against boroughs, meat-producer against meat-consumer.
Earthquake in the morning. Political parties all mixed up in the
evening. Heneage, a good Liberal, leads Opposition against the
Government. Randolph, not unknown as a Conservative, goes into
Lobby with Liberals.
"I'm afraid," says Randolph, amid appreciative laughter,
"maintenance of Lords' Amendment will adversely affeot urban
populations."
"But surely Woodstock'.is not an urban population ?." says
Sewell Read in his matter-of-fact way.
"No, but Birmingham is," says Randolph. Then Read began to
see it, and laughed—a little late. Curious effect this single burst of
laughter after general roar over.
For onoe Dodson saw clearly through Fogg. Government defeated
by 185 votes against 161. In general jumble of things Fobster
appeared as champion of Government. Massive frame trembling
with honest indignation, manly voioe ohoked with emotion because
Beach had been saving things" about Government. Gladstone,
clutching blotting-pad between both hands, sits sternly scanning the
uproarious Opposition with every vestige of colour fled from cheeks,
faoe suddenly grown thinner, wrinkles deeper, and eyes feverishly
bright. Dances upon Beach for a few fond moments, casts his
mangled body aside, and then, anger having blazed out, sets himself
with forced calmness to show necessity of forthwith reporting
progress.
"Think we've got them on the hip this time," said Coleridge
Kennard to Chaplin. "They '11 never be able to foroe their Amend-
ment through the House."
"They've one chance," said Chaplin, gloomily. "Theymig^ht
give us Dodson to lead the Opposition." At Evening Sitting Irish
Members just suoceeded in making House, so that Sir Joseph Gillis
might put knightly lance in rest on behalf of certain Irish Ladies.
When the preux chevalier had pranced round for a few minutes
Aumistkad moved Count. Pretty to see indignation of Healy,
Harrington, O'Brien, and Joey B. himself. Couldn't have been
more shocked had they discovered AiMistead picking Sir George
Balfour's pocket as he slept. "Counts Out, like bad language,
evidently monopoly of these gentlemen," said Member for Dundee,
when he found himself safe in Palace Yard. "They won't let me,
onoe in way, do ' Armistead of them.'"
Business done.—Great case decided. Dear Meat versus Cheap
Meat. Verdiot for plaintiff. Costs to be borne by working
Wednesday.—Met Harcoubt going down early to House this
afternoon buried in chin and deep thought. Looking across space
and so far over my head. Gave short cough. (Sharp bark some
people call it.) Harcourt started. Seemed angry. Not a time
for larking, Toby," he said. "Had shock enough with this Earth-
quake.
'Such omens met the eye when Cesar fell.
"Meaning Gladstone?"

THE END OP THE HUNTING SEASON.
By Our Own Novice.
Good-bye to the Season! E'en gluttons
Have had quite enough of the game,
And if we returned to our muttons,
Our horses are laid up and lame.
We hunted straight on through the winter,
And never were stopped by the frost,
As I know right well from each splinter
Of bone that my poor limbs have lost.
Good-bye to the Season! The " croppers"
I got where the fences were tall.
And Oh the immaculate "toppers"
That always were crushed by my fall.
Don't think though that I'm so stout-hearted
As e'er to jump hedges or dikes,
It's simply that after we've started,
My "gee" gallivants as it likes.
In vain I put on natty breeches.
And tops like Meltonian swell,
It ends in the blessed old ditches,
I know like the Clubs in Pall Mall.
And when from a " gee " that's unruly
I fall with a terrible jar,
I know that old Jorrocks spoke truly.
And hunting's " the image of war."
And never for me " Fair Diana"
Shall smile as we know that she can,
With looks that are sweeter than manna,
On many a fortunate man.
It adds to the pangs that I suffer,
When thrown at a fence in her traok,
To hear her " Ridiculous duffer!"
When jumping slap over my back.
I've fractured my ulnar, I'm aching
Where over my ribs my horse rolled;
Egad! the " Old Berkeley" is making
One man feel uncommonly old.
Good-bye to the Season! I'm shattered
And damaged in figure and face;
But thankful to find I'm not scattered
In pieces all over the place!
"Werdant Green at Oxford."—On the judgment
against Sir Werdant for £4 15s., for flowers at election
time, the Observer observes that the question is whether
Sir Werdant was "properly served." If he received a
white summons, he wasn't: if a pink one, he was. A
certain sporting journal will be anxious to ;know if Sir
Werdant was duly served with a " Pink 'un." But as
to being " properlv served," the Fathers of the City de-
clare that that can't be until they have had a turn at him.
"No. Thinking at the moment of the Home Office.
'And who can tell
Whether these awful Messengers of Fate
Are meant for Kings or Sec'taries of State.'
Know your Bjmbastes Furioso f"
"Yes. A former Home-Secretary, wasn't he? But why so early?"
"It'8 this Earthquake. Understand Warton is going to ask
'What steps Her Majesty's Government took to prepare for or avert
the catastrophe?' Ashmead-Babtlett will ask Whether it is true
that for some days past suspicious persons, understood to be Russian
Officers in disguise, have been seen in the Eastern Counties?'
Chaplin wants to know ' Whether the Privy Council took any steps
to have the Earthquake slaughtered at the port of entry?' Don't
know why I should have to answer, but Cabinet agreed that Earth-
quake is in my Department."
Oddly enough, no Questions put at all, the explanation being that
there was no business to delay. Business done.—None.
Thursday.—■" Curious how this Government feels my influence to
uttermost ends of its policy," said Mr. Marriott, puffing himself
out in imitation of the inimitable Petek counterfeiting the Lord
Lawrence Monument. "At my election all the four-wheelers voted
for me. What follows? Childers brings in Budget. Got a
miserable surplus. Admits can't remit taxation, but takes care to
throw a sop to cabby. Reduces licence-duty on four-wheelers. Not
quite sure how far this might be affected by Corrupt Practices Act.
Shall look it up."
Randolph much quieter since his Birmingham trip. "No more
larks, Wolffy," he says. "All very well when we were boys
together. Now I'm a Statesman and must behave as such." Never-
theless couldn't resist temptation about Mr. Hubbard to-night. Old
gentleman got a speech ready for to-morrow on Income Tax, House
Duty, Local Taxation or some other cheerful topic. Government
propose to take Morning 'Sitting. "Then what will become of my
speech," says Old Mother Hubbard, dismally looking round to
laughing House. Wanted to get bit of it off now. Callea to order.
Move Adjournment," Randolph whispered in his ear, "1 urgent
matter of public importance,' don't you know?"
So, 0. M. H., wringing his hands, trying hard to keep back rising
burst of tears, and looking comically as if he had just been to
the cupboard, and found it empty of provisions, took the paper from
the wicked Randolph, and made his Motion whilst House laughed
and jeered, and for a whole hour wouldn't let him withdraw Motion,
whilst Childers fidgeted and Gladstone fumed.
Business done.—Budget brought in.
Friday.—Nice useful day. Met for Morning Sitting to prepare
Municipal Elections Bill for Grand Committee. No one objects to
Bill; Second Reading an affair of an hour; so other Bills put down
to follow. That was the arrangement. What really happened was
this: Conservatives, headed by Jemmy Lowther, worried Daddy
Dodds and his Railway Bill for two hours. Easy task thereafter to
talk out Municipal Elections Bill. At Evening Sitting Old Mother
Hubbard triumphantly produced her treasured bone labelled " In-
cidence of Income Tax." Gladstone sprung upon bone, utterly
demolished it, frightened life out of 0. M. H. Then interesting
discussion on Jamaica, and at One o'Clock House Counted Out.
Business done.—None.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Busixes".

The Operatic Canterbury Pilgrims ; or, Medieval Excursionists, personally conducted by Mr. Carl Eosa.
My dear Mb. Gye,
You've been too busy, of course, to attend to anything
exoept the business at your Italian Warehouse, and therefore unable
to be present at Drury Lane, where, you will be rejoiced to hear,
the greatest success has been aohieved by an English Opera written
by an English Author and English Composer, and sung by real
English singers. The success, too, was chiefly due to the book ;"
and this will seem strange to you, with only your experience of
libretti, done into English by anybody (generally speaking), for
which the Publio do not care a rap except as a guide to the story,
otherwise obscure, and which is of no value to anybody except the
translator, the printer, the publisher, the officials in the house (who
never have change for a florin when the price of the book is eighteen-
pence), and perhaps the Manager, who may have retained some
interest in it. But of late years, at other houses which you have
hadjio opportunity of visiting, all this has been changed. In eccen-
tric bouffes we have the Author named with the Composer,—nay,
before him, as is his place in point of time, though not of tune.
Where would the Operatic Composer be without the Author, whose
libretto inspires him r What is the complaint one constantly hears
from Composers who are credited by their friends with capabilities
for Opera, but who have never yet got beyond ballads? They say,
"Ah i I should like to do an Opera, if I could only get a good
'book'!" Bless them, there are lots of good books about,—goody-
goody books, and a Magazine called Good Words (I believe) into the
bargain, but not the book to inspire the Operatio Composer. I
emphasise " Operatic," because obviously the Composers of Sympho-
nies, of instrumental quartettes, fantasias, songs without words, &c,
&c, &c, are independent of a librettist, but not so the Operatio
Composer. His raison d'etre is the Dramatic Author, as the raison
d'etre of Singers and Musicians is the Composer. Where would
Singers be I without "little songs for them to sing"? where the
Musicians without "little tunes for them to play" t and where the
Manager? And, as you yourself would put it with admirable can-
dour, where would you be but for all these talented people, whose
services are at your disposition for a consideration? And so the world
is on the elephant, and the elephant on the tortoise, and the tortoise—
what is he on't Well, he has to rely on himself and stand upon his
own dignity.
It was a nappy thought, this selection by Mr. Gilbert a Beckett
of the idea of utilising the Canterbury Pilgrims. I should imagine
that he hit on the title first, and then was utterly knocked over by
the inspiration. The association between a Beckett and Canterbury
is of course obvious and natural. Then the next thing was to chaw
up Chaucer, and trust to his own ingenuity for a plot. Here he
has succeeded thoroughly, for the plot is nearly as good as that of
the Merry Wives of Windsor, to whose paunchy, weak, cunning,
fatuous, vain, humorous, and wicked old hero, Sir Christopher
Synge (Mr. Ludwig) bears a close resemblance in all but the fat
knight's unwieldy size and in his bachelorhood. For -Sir Christo-
pher, in order to "keep up the Christopher," is married to a young
wife,—she is young as represented by Miss Marion Burton,—whose
name is Dame Margery, of whom Sir Christopher, on reconsidera-
tion, might have sung, had Mr. Stanford given him such a
chance as Mr. Hatton would have done, "What! marry young
Margery, No! No! No!"—but there's nothing so rollicking, so
jovial, so "tuney-tuney" as the ballad of Old Simon the Cel-
larer throughout the Opera.
And this reminds me that you are going to bring out Messrs.
a Beckett and Stanford's Savonarola, an English Opera (recently
so triumphantly successful at Hamburg) by an English Author and
an English Composer; and on its first appearance in its own native
land it is to be disguised in German!
I forget who your Stage-Manager is at Covent Garden, where the
action of the chorus is directed by classic rules. But he will, I am
sure, be delighted to hear that Mr. Augustus Harris has put such
life and motion into this English chorus and these English singers
(but specially the ohorus, as the principals, excepting Mr. Ludwig,
probably know quite enough without being taught, and wisely keep
it to themselves), that, from first to last, the Canterbury Pilgrims
was performed as if it was a real Acting Drama—one of Messrs.
Pettitt and Harris's, for example,—instead of "only an Opera."
The scenery, too, was all that you could.desire, and that is saying a
great deal, isn't it P
It seems to me—(but if you, my dear Mr. Gye, are gye-rating
between the New German and the Old Italian style, you will not have
made up your mind in time to agree with me)—that Mr. Stanford,
thorough Musician as he is, has been bitten by a Wagnerish-Meister-
singerish notion of what a Comic Opera ought to be, and has said to
himself, without mentioning it to his Librettist, who, of course,
couldn't have prevented him, but who could have suggested dramatic
points, "I will not write what is popularly known as a ' tune,' and
if I ever catch myself dropping into tune as Wegg did into poetry, I
shall smother it up with instrumentation, and endeavour to let it be.
forgotten as quickly as possible. No; if I ever drop into tune, I
deserve to be 'dropped into' by the Critics afterwards." Now, as
Mr. Stanford has consistently stuck to this principle, he cannot be
robbed by any other unprincipled [Composer, for there is_literally
"nothing to take away with you."
Here and there quaint tuneful bits spring up suddenly, but being
immediately suppressed as too lively, they are like John Leech's
long-haired Skye terrier which seemed to have neither head nor tail,
and never take the form and shape of what are technically called
"numbers." Yet a Composer would do well to recollect that there
is "Luck in odd numbers, and let us have a few good ones. What
he may be in serious Opera we shall know on hearing Savonarola;
but in dealing with the greater part of the dialogue, and most of
the situations of this Comedy-Opera, he is so hopelessly undramatic
as to suggest the idea that he has failed to appreciate the real
humour of the subject, and has gone in heavily.—very heavily,—
for exalting his musical Bcienoe at the expense of Dramatic Art.
For a real success in Opera, no matter whether serious, comio,
eccentric, or bouffe, Author and Composer ought to work together as
one man; and their umpire in all cases of dispute should be the
Stage-Manager, who in this case is the Emperor Augustus Drurio-
lanus.
I am certain, my dear Mr. Gye, that this Opera will improvo on
repetition, and by the time you produce it at Covent Garden
translated into choice Italian with an English re-translation [done by
the Gasman or the man who takes the coats and hats and lends out
opera-glasses], its music will be well known, and extracts from it will
have become highly popular. The extracts can be made, though at
first hearing this would seem a difficult task. But Mr. a Beckett
has written songs and Mr. Stanford has written excellent music to
them, only he won't stop to hear you say, " There! I like that," but
hurries on to the next bar as if he wanted to catch a train of thought
that had got ahead of him.
I think you, my dear Mr. Gye, would highly appreciate the acting
of the Drury Lane Company, as, with the exception of Mr. Ludwig
and two of the chorus, it is mostly of the Italian-Operatic school.
Indeed, Mr. Barrington Foote makes Hal o' the Chepe a thorough
Italian rendering of the Spanish Barber Figaro. But that he speaks

HAPPY THOUGHT.
He. "In America, you know, we have no Standing Arm?."
She. "What! are thet all Mounted t"
English so plainly you would not be surprised to hear him suddenly
defy Mr. Stanford and burst into "Ah bravo. Figaro, bravo
bravissimo!" The Pilgrirm' comedy-dialogue never drops into farce
or burlesque; there are no jeux de mots in it; and so both Author
and Composer may be congratulated on being consistent contra-
puntists.
Mr. B. Davies, as Hubert Lovel, the apprentice in love with
Cicely (Miss Perry—" with whom," sayB Mr. Wagstaff, "he pairs
off"—oh! yes, pre-Cicely so!) might belong to any operatic company,
and is of no distinct nationality.
For my part, or rather for his part, I liked Mr. Ludwig, as he made
the most of any chance which the Composer had left untouched, or
had (for a wonder) brought out into prominence. The Author must
have studied very hard to have so completely imbued his work with
the mediaeval phraseology. For instance, when Hal o' the Chepe (a
sort of "'Abby on the cheap" of those tunes) has put a chalk-mark
on a door,instead of telling the knight, "That door I chalked,"
which would be our modern prosaic fashion, he says, "The door
chalked I"—whioh is, you must own, my dear Mr. Gye, infinitely
superior, and so poetio, too! How far preferable is " A cab took I
to " I took a oab "! That's my style in future. "Scurvy knaves"
is good too. I don't quite know to what sort of persons to apply it,
and should be sorry to be incorrect in a first attempt. But I'll risk
it with a street-boy who insists on opening my cab-door for me. But
I will not try it on a cabman who won't take his proper fare, and is
inclined to be abusive and physically demonstrative. Marry! that
will I not!
Then, too, the Dramatist has thoroughly mastered the manners and
customs of those times; as, for instance, when the old Innkeeper enters
at night, and seeing young Hubert in a sort of domino, with the hood
up, playing a diminutive banjo (then known as "a lute"), and, in
fact, evidently serenading bis daughter Cicely, he acoepts the mildest
possible explanation, and says to himself, '"Tis a pious Monk."
Now, if being out late at night and playing on a lute were in these
times the sign of a " pious Monk," why, the subsequent Reformation
might have well taken place a little earlier than it actually did. Let
me know when you are bringing out the English Opera by Messrs.
a Beckett and Stanford in German at the Italian Opera-House,
and I '11 be there. I know you will do your best to get Carl Rosa
to stay and continue the series, but he can't. He '11 stop longer next
time. Meanwhile, when Carl Rosa's away, Savonarola will play.
Success to you ana yours, Mr. Gye, is the sentiment of your sincere
well-wisher, Nibbs.

Drape it in mourning, the Conductor's Beat,
Where over Music-land he ruled so long.
Sound woke to triumph at his magic beat,
And softest prelude sweetened into song!
Enthroned he sat, in the grand days of old,
Beloved and trusted by the men he led.
What memories that life-time could unfold!
Art's children, who no more Life's stage shall tread!
Great Costa's dead!
Throw no more garlands on the empty stage,
Hang them with love around his vacant chair;
Of mighty Opera he closed the page,
Then went to lead sweet voices in the air!
Changed is the scene! Musicians of the past
Will rise to greet his ooming; and the sigh
Of half-forgotten melody will oast
Shadows of love! Friends left can only cry
Costa! good-bye!
THEORY AND PRACTICE.
Lord Dalhousie has recently spent a couple of nights and days
on board a trawler in the North Sea, in order to qualify himself
by practical knowledge for sitting on a Commission to examine into
the grievances of Fishermen.
This excellent example suggests various ways in whioh other
members of the Ministry might usefully employ any leisure they
possess. For example :—
1. Mr. Gladstone, after a fortnight in Dartmoor Convict Esta-
blishment would be able to inform the world whether he felt any
"disability to return " to Downing Street when " hemmed in" (but
not "surrounded") by dozens of stern Warders, and walls twenty
feet high.
2. Mr. Dodson would perhaps be the better for a few happy days
spent at Dei >t ford in company with an infuriated British Farmer and
an imported bullock suffering from foot-and-mouth disease.
3. Mr. Trevelyan, as an amateur Detective, "made up," let us
say, as Mr. Biggar, might learn something of the'new "Impregnable
Invincibles" by a little money judiciously spent upon the Head
Centres " in New York. This might be called a Head Centralising
policy.
4. Mr. Chamberlain obviously ought to take a voyage round

allow any opportunity for dealing with this Orangeism to slip.

and to the Eoyal Society of the Jolly Old Watermen, at 5, Pall Mall.)

No. 341. "The Drunken liutler; or, Like Husler like .
(See description in Catalogue.)

No. 52. "Waiting for the Photogra-
pher." (See description in Catalogue.)
In most cases, as this Catalogue is intended to be a companion as
well as a guide, where we do not give the illustration it will be found
necessary to refer to the picture itself in the Academy. In many
instances it will be at once peroeived by the visitor that the Artist
has failed to appreciate his own work, and that it has been left for us
to tell him what it really means, what should have been its oorrect
title, and to put him right whoever he may be.
Passing No. 4, which we reserve for illustration on our next visit,
we begin with
No. 15. "Early Sorrow." So young and yet so grey! Or is it
Miss De Obey the Actress? For information, inquire of the Artist,
C. E. Pebugini.
No. 16. "Prestonpans." Evidently an incident in the battle of
Prestonpans. It might be fairly termed "An Action on the Out-
skirts." It is scarcely complimentary to the bravery of the Scotch
soldiers, as of the two represented as engaged in the action, one is
standing still, his head being quite turned, and the other is cutting
away! It is the clever work of J. Watson Nicol.
No. 35. "I'll eat my hat if I don't catch one of her eyes." This
is one of those pictures which tells its own——Stobey, A.
No. 45. "A Charade." By H. Stacy Mabks, R.A. We guessed
it at once. The word is "Monkey." Monk: Key: Very good,
Mr. Mabks, though not so absolutely new and original as we should
have expected.
No. 49. "A Little Venetian." Claude Calthbop. It might be
anything up aloft. If its price is equal to its elevated position, the
Artist will be a lucky man, and we wish he may get it.
No. 52. " Waiting for the Photographer." Anxious Lady holding
her St. Bernard steady, so as to have him taken in a good attitude,
This is another tell-tale picture,—in this instance the tail of a dog,—
withoutjreference to the Cat-alogiie. By the way, for such a splendid
dog what a very feeble tale it is! You might "wait for the
waggin'" a long time, but there's no waggishness there. Still,
except for this, a mastifful Picture by Bbiton Riviebe, R.A.
No. 53. "Old Mill on the French Coast (commenced I860)."
H.W. B. Davis, R.A. Not so very old the Mill, if commenced in '60.
No. 88. "Found Out"; or, jEsopian Comic Scene in Animal Life.
Jackasses roaring with laughter, and saying to one another, " What!
he call 'imself a Lion!! Why, it 'a only Jumbo dressed up! Hee-
haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!" Bbiton Riviebe, R.A.
No. 89. "Twice Bitten once Caught; or, Night Scene in New
Lodgings." G. Gascoyne. "The poor young man couldn't get a
wink of sleep. At last he thought he had secured his tormentor.


No. 168. "A Morning Call; or,
"ght we to Visit Her i" Julia B.
Fc
No. 88. "Found Out." (Ste description in Catalogue.)

No. 3.37. "I used your soup ten years
ago, and since then I've used no
other." H. Fantin.
Rushing into his grandfather's
room, he woke the excellent old
Gentleman out of his first doze,
saying, 'Here he is! When I

hand."—Extract from " Knippeb's Curiosities of the Insect World."
Gaixeby No. II.
No. 131. The very Picture of thorough annoyance. Elderly
Sportsman (loq.). "HW provoking! Here I've brought down my
gun for shooting, and the stupid servants have only packed up my
fishing-tackle, and sent no cartridges." After this ne explodes—
and goes off. We knew at once that this was by John Evebett
Mill a is, R.A.
No. 136. A Temperance Picture. Serious warning to youth. Here
she is, prostrate! Very sad, and such a bad example to her younger
sisters. John Collieb.
No. 155. "A Very Superior Person." Colin Hunteb, R.A.
No. 161. View of Cows, described in the Academy Cattle-log as
"Pushing off for Tilbury Fort." Who's pushing offi" What's
being pushed? ofi? We thought at first it was a prospect of " Goring-
on-Thames," but it isn't. Where is this "Fort of Tilbury "? But.
no matter whether the Fort of Tilbury is visible or not, cattle will
always be the forte of Thomas Sidney Coopkb, R.A.
No. 190. Trying to arrange for a new piece at the Haymarket,
being a Portrait of Mr. Bancboft without a Caste in his eye.
W. W. Ouless R.A.
No. 298. "H.E.H. The Prince of Wales, K.G." after a severe
course of training. The Artist is to be congratulated on having well
brought out the Hair to the Crown. Fbank Holl, RA.
No. 341. "The Drunken Butler; or, Like Master like Man."
Another picture which tells its own story without any reference to
the Catalogue being necessary. A beautiful Lady and a Roman-
nosed Gentleman are seated vis-d-vis at a long table. It is dessert-
time, and the Butler is filling his Master's glass with claret. What
is the story? Evident. Regard the stolid look of the Gentleman;
he has had too much wine already, and another glass will finish him.
Observe the Butler: his eyes are almost closed, he can scarcely see
what he is about; he also is the worse for liquor. The Mistress of
the House perceives it, and only look at her face and see how
disgusted she is! She doesn't like to upbraid her husband before the
Butler, she doesn't like to scold the Butler and give him a month's

warning there and then, heeause, as the Butler is rather a favourite j No. 347. "A Little Music: Small and Early." Military Fife-
with her husband, it would lead to a tremendous row. The title of' boy playing to children. It is said that £5,000 was paid for this

the picture might be "Like Master like Man." Or there's another
story it tells. It is simply the Drunken Butler who is familiarly
saying to the Master of the House, "have 'nother glash wine "—and
his master, a serious elderly aristocrat, is delibe-
rating whether he shall (or can) get up and kick
him out, or take no notice of it. His wife, or
daughter, or niece, or grass widow, or whatever
she is with whom he is dining (or is he dining with
her ?) evidently doesn't want to be mixed up with
the matter, and is sorry she came. When that
Butler is out of the room she will give her host, or
guest, or father, or uncle, or husband, or whatever
he may be, a bit of her mind,—not that she has
very much to spare. And so but now we come
to think of it the picture tells ever so many other
stories according to what relationship may be sup-
posed to exist between the two dinner companions.
Therefore we will refer to the Catalogue. Dear us!
it is called " Mariage de Conrenance." Of course.
That settles it. She is the daughter of a bourgeois
millionnaire, and he is a titled, but not bloated,
aristocrat. "They have lived and loved (somebody
else) together"—and in moody silence they have
dined together. Now we see the full title of this (the
picture of the year par excellence) should be " Un
Mariage de Conrenance; or, Getting their Desserts"

thorough annoyance. {See des-
cription in Catalogue.)

Henry Irving putting his hand in his pocket. Of
course there's no mistaking it for anybody else ex-
cept Ieving. But it's weak, flat, and thin, and not

No. 373. Two of Mr. Stacy Marks's birds, which
are as well known as St. Mark's pigeons. Toujours
perdrix.
Sir Robert Peel will be delighted to hear that
the Royal Academy rejected Mr. Macallum's pic-
ture, which everyone is Draising on seeing it in the
Grosvenor Gallery. It is supposed that the Royal
Academy Committee considered they were becoming
a trifle over-Scotched, and, to avoid being known as
the Macademy, they declined this picture. Another
theory is, that they didn't catch the Painter's name,
and hadn't time to examine the work of Art, which
was rejected simply as being Mr. What-you-
macallum's picture.
So far for our First Visit. Quitting the Oil-land,
—which we present, gratis, to its painter, W. Q. Orchardson, R.A. | we naturally betake ourselves to the Water. So here goes for the—
PICCADILLY SHOW.
Of course the gem of the show must be, to our eyes,
No. 559. An Ldyll. By John Tenniel, R.I. It is simply a lion
with three boys, and, like all really inspired works of Art of
symbolical character, it is capable of more than one interpretation.
First Interpretation.—An instance of L'embarras des richesses;
or, The Lion at Home after Breakfast. He is not hungry; he has
his eyes nearly closed; ne is quietly observant. He allows the three
boys to tickle him with roses, while he is considering which of the
three he shall select for his luncheon. Bearing in mind the well-
known tastes of the lion, the Artist has suggested in the figure of the
plavful small boy in front of the Monarch of Beasts that his choice
will probably fall on the lively little kid.
Second Interpretation.—The picture has a political signification.
It represents Master Gladstone
at one ear of the British Lion,
seriously whispering something
into it, which the noble beast is
trying to understand, being com-
pelled to shut his eyes to facts
while under the spell of Master
Williams' oratory; and on the
other side is Master Stafford
Northcote, mildly accepting
flowers of speech from the perky
little party who represents Lord
Randolph Churchill.
2'hird Interpretation.—ThePun-
ishment of Idyllness. Truant boys,
on their way to school, throw down
their books, and stop to play with
a lion, when they ought to be at
their studies. The result will be, of
course, that the lion gives them a
lesson. Perhaps our Mr. Tenntel
will give us the sequel to this tragic
tale in the next Exhibition.
We have an eminent horticul-
turist's opinion for saying that the
flowers with which the boys are
decorating the lion are " Might in
the mane."
No. 12. The Judgment of Paris.

Dadd's picture—that is, we won't

really appropriate Water-colour subject. As to Mr. Walter
Crane's picture, "There will be," says Mr. Wagstaff, "Divers

No. 100. Performing Troupe of Turks—the Tumbling Turks—make
their first appearance for the amusement of an elderly Lady who hasn't
laughed for years. The leader is giving a back; a boy in armour is
explaining the entertainment; Turk No. 2, refusing to " oyer," is
being remonstrated with by elder performer, who assures him that
it isn't difficult, and that, if he were younger, he would do it him-
self. The picture tells its own story, and the Artist, W. E. Lock-
hart, R.S.A., tells another when be says in the Catalogue that he
intended this to illustrate "The Cid and the Five Moorish Kings."

When this Picture has passed into history, posterity will say, "Ah!
there were fine men in those days!" (and fine women, too, for the
matter of that)—as not one of them,
except a thoughtful ecclesiastic,
can possibly be less than six feet
something. One of the two Reign-
ing Favourites who is not singing,
and whose subjects have tempo-
rarily deserted her for the song-
stress, is evidently saying to herself
"I won't ask her to any of my
parties." Then, when the song is
over, won't she get up and compli-
ment her rival, and thank her, and
even ask her to sing again and again
and again, on the chance that
she may fail once, or overdo it,
and wear out the patience of her
present enthusiastic admirers. Our
Own One has shown what can be
done with our evening trouserings,
vestings, and dress-coatings of
1884, and proves, triumphantly,
that we are not such unpicturesque
and ungainly people as the lauda-
tores temporu acti, the aesthetes, and
the classicists would have us believe.
Compared with our habiliments,—a
fig for classic robes, a fig for your
Charles the Second's and your Four
Georges'! and give us the easy,
graceful, picturesque costume of the
time of George the Fifth, sur-
named Du Maurier. And in
praising him and his Picture thusly,
we only give our Maurier his Du.
By the way, Sir John, the Cata-
logue is rather confoozlum. Why
not have the illustrations marked with the same numbers as they are
in the first part of the Catalogue, and as they are numbered on the
walls? Instead of which, each Picture which has an Illustration has
a double number. All very well as to admirers; and each Picture
we hope will have a treble number. But for reference it's puzzling.

What's in a name ?—sure, dull of brain and crass
Is he, who, Briton born, can quaff unstirred,
By all the wholesome magio of the word,
That royal drink of drinks our native " Bass!"
Ay! Royal in its sober honest strength
As he, that King of steady workers, who,
His lone well-ordered life passed nobly through,
Has heard the summons,—and is gone at length!
Peace rest with him; for round his memory clings

GOOD MANNERS; OR, THE ART OF BEING
AGREEABLE.
(Being Maxims and Extracts from Lord Jester field's Letters.)
No. in.
Sudden Friendliness highly Recohmended.—Immediately on
being introduced to anyone, no matter of what rank or degree in
the social scale he may be, carefully note if others call him by his
Christian name, and if so, immediately adopt this mode of addressing
your new acquaintance. Such a method has a smack of heartiness
about it, which is muoh relished by the person so addressed, as it
will at once put both of you at your ease; and a cheery salute of
"Billy, old hoy!" to anyone whose acquaintance you have made
just five minutes previously, may be the commencement of a friend-
ship that will only terminate with life.
On Natural Selection of Company.—Always choose to consort
with those who are superior to you in station, especially when within
sight of your relatives, friends, enemies, or your tradespeople.
Nothing redounds so much to your credit with these last as being
seen walking and talking familiarly, nay, even affectionately, with
a nobleman of reputation. If you have had. the good fortune of having
been presented to a Royal Personage, seize every ohanoe of coming
across him. of taking; off your hat to him, of speaking to him in
public, and of alluding to your intimacy with him among your
friends and relations.
On Accomplishments.—In order to contribute your share towards
the general entertainment of the company, it is the truest modesty
to let everyone know what 'you can do as soon as possible. For
instance, if you can play the piano ever so little, sit down imme-
diately (that is, on being introduced to your host or hostess for the
first time, having been brought there by a friend) at the piano, and
rattle off something, even \f the performance be only with one
finger. The well-known melodies of ''in my Cottage," "Home, sweet
Home ."' "The March in Norma," and " God save the Queen.'"
(for which last you will request all the company to evince their
loyalty by standing up) wiU be quite sufficient to give your new
friends a specimen of your capabilities, and an evidence of your
willingness to oblige.
If you can sing, never by any chance go anywhere without
your songs, words, and music. Do not wait to be asked to sing, or
your friends and acquaintances may never know what a pleasure
they have lost till you are gone, but at once announce your in-
tention of giving them, with or without accompaniment, "Dream-
ing of Angels," "Ever Thine!" "My Fair Dove, my Fond
Dove."' "In the Gloaming," with one or two old English varieties,
such as " The Death of Nelson," " Sally in our Alley," "Aboard
the Arethusa," "The Bailiff's Daughter," and so forth. These
songs I only mention here as indications of a generally useful reper-
toire, which, however, may, and probably will, include some popular
Italian, French, and German ballads. These you will sing; in their
own native tongue. Do not quit the piano, or give up singing, until
you -have clearly ascertained the feeling of the company on the
matter, as to prolong any entertainment of this sort beyond
certain limits is to incur the danger of fatiguing an audience. So,
after giving them half-a-dozen songs, you may at once recite some-
thing, or give imitations of popular Actors; and should Nature not
have gifted you with a singing voice (of which you cannot be sure
until you have given it a fair trial before successive audiences) you
will commence with recitals, or conjuring, or gymnastics, or poses
plastiques (a friend bringing a portable pocket lime-light apparatus
with him to enable you to do the Greek statues—" Ajax defying the
Lightning," and so forth), or, in faot, will exhibit any accomplish-
ment you may happen to possess. Only remember the golden rule
given at the commencement of this advice, Do not wait tooe asked.
For example: Suppose you can only recite, or that you can only do
poses plastiques: well—you are introduced to the host and hostess:—
Introducer. You kindly said I might bring my friend—allow me to
introduce Mr. X .
Host and Hostess. Delighted to make your acquaintance, &c, &c.
Mr. X. (yourself). The pleasure is mutual. You will be glad to
know that I can recite—just move a little on one side to allow my
arm free play—thank you. (Throws himself into attitude, and com-
mences.) "The boy stood on the burning deck," &c, &c.
Or, if poses plastiques are your line, the formula will be changed to—
Mr. X. The pleasure is mutual. Perhaps you are not aware that
I can execute a series of poses plastiques. Allow me—(announce* in
a loud tone)—" The Dying Gladiator."
[Throws himself on the floor in the well-known attitude.
And so on.
Another Golden Rule.—Never be so silly as to say " I cannot do
such and such a thing" whatever it may be, but keeping to yourself
the fact that you have never tried it (whether it be carving
venison, dancing a mazourka, helping a Lady to mount her horse,
shooting, playing billiards, playing the violoncello, painting a por-
trait, or any one of a hundred other things that may suggest them-
selves to even the most accomplished Cricbton), politely undertake to
oblige, and essay it—with a will. Depend upon it, it is a great thing
to establish for yourself the reputation of being so very willing, so
amiable, so ready to oblige in everything."
Advice and Instruction.—Don't be dashed by a first failure; in
carving, for example, you may make the gravy spurt over every-
body, and send the haunch flying; in dancing you may fall down
on the slippery floor, dragging your partner with you (don't let her
goybut be cheery, and cry, "Up again! and on we goes to
China!" or any other encouraging phrase): or in assisting a lady to
mount, you may throw her right over the horse, or bring her down

THE WOMAN OF THE FUTURE.
A Lay of the Oxford Victory.
The "Woman of the Future! She '11 be deeply read, that's certain,
With all the education gained at Newnham or at Girton;
She '11 puzzle men in Algebra with horrible quadratics,
Dynamics, and the mysteries of higher mathematics;
Or, if she turns to classio tomes a literary roamer.
She '11 give you bits of Horace or sonorous lines from Homek.
You take a maiden in to dine, and find, with consternation,
She scorns the light frivolities of modern conversation;
And not for her the latest bit of fashionable chatter,
Her pretty head is well-nigh full of more important matter;
You talk of Drama or Burlesque, theatric themes pursuing,;
She only thinks of what the Dons at Oxford may be doing.
A female controversialist will taokle you quite gaily,
With scraps from Pearson on the Creed, or extracts culled from
Paley;
And, if you parry these homethrusts just like a wary fencer.
She'll floor you with some Stuart Mill, or else with Herbert
Spencer.
In fact, unless with all such'lore you happen to be laden.
You'd better shun, if you've a ohance, an educated maiden.
The Woman of the Future may be very learned-looking,
But dare we ask if sho '11 know aught of housekeeping or cooking;
She '11 read far more, and that is well, than empty-headed beauties,
But has she studied with it all a woman's chiefest duties?
We wot she '11 ne'er acknowledge, till her heated brain grows cooler,
That Woman, not the Irishman, should be the true home-ruler.
0 pedants of these later days, who go on undiscerning.
To overload a woman's brain and cram our girls with learning,
You '11 make a woman half a man, the souls of parents vexing,
To find that all the gentle sex this process is unsexing.
Leave one or two nice girls before the sex your system smothers,
Or what on earth will poor men do for sweethearts, wives, and
mothers?

To the Editor.
Sib,—Give us leave to handle in the briefest possible manner this topic, as
lately treated and commented on in your pages. We are more than surprised;
nay. we are absolutely astonished at the many omissions we have discovered in
the list of contemporary Authors that.have been furnished by your contributors.
Let us give a few instances:—
Pray turn to Poetry. What finer Poet have we than Bobbs? His Lunar
Lullabys will be remembered when the name of Tennyson is utterly forgotten.
And yet Bobbs, the accomplished_BoBBS, has been overlooked. An outrage,
Sir—an outrage!
Then as to History. Take a hundred people from all parts of Europe indis-
criminately; and examine them as to their knowledge of the leading Chroniclers
of the passing times, and we will warrant you that nine-tenths of them will
point to Cobbs as the Historian of the period. And yet we find no mention
of Cobbs, the erudite Cobbs! This should not be I
Come now to Fiction. At once the Author of Aunt Lucy's Needlecase will
occur to everyone. A man who could write such a novel may well be buried
with Thackeray and Dickens. Surely those who know his works would
willingly give him a grave in Westminster Abbey. And yet Dobbs, the fanciful
Dobbs, is absolutely ignored! Oh, shame! shame 1
Turning to the Drama, matters are even worse. It might have been sup-
posed that his glorious, albeit unpublished, Tragedy of Pigius Porcus the
Persian, would nave saved him the indignity,—but no, Fobbs is passed over
like the rest! Surely this is a scandal, a disgrace! If anyone deserves well of
his country, it is Fobbs, the constructive Fobbs. And yet Fobbs is entirely
forgotten 1 Oh, the pity o' it, the pity o' it!
And now, having stated our grievance, we append our names, not for publi-
cation, but as a guarantee of good faith.

GORDON IN THE GAP.
Into the hole that'opened in the Forum
When Marcus Curtius rode, armed cap-a-pie,
Down went below that crack young cockalorum;
Rome's ohiefest opulence his horse and he.
The gulf closed o'er them; that heroio chap
So sacrificed himself, but stopped the gap.
"Oh, what a friend at need in just the nick
Of time!" the Populus Romanus cried;
"How big a breach, repaired with what a brick!"
Sang the Quirites out on every side.
And all the Senate voted him a trump,
For daring down that dreadful gulf to jump.
They were content. His self-devotion cost
Them not an as; they nothing had to pay:
A hero by his leap was all they lost.
Because he gratis threw his life away;
All of his own accord, and at his sole
Expense, he threw himself into a hole.
Not quite as Curtius to a certain doom
Went Gordon, for, hemmed in by savage foes,
Though he is in a hole, too, at Khartoum,
The hole did not at once above him close;
And " Yah!" the people to their Rulers shout,
"Why don't you send the means to help him out?"
Curtius not only dared to die, but died
Outright, to serve his country at a pinch.
Gordon has fate as gallantly defied,
And will no more from any danger flinch.
Do we too want the generous and the brave
To pay for all—and so the nation save P

SSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Home of Commons, Monday, April 28.—" Don't know how you
bear it, Toby," said Onslow just now, "but I find Parliamentary
life very exhausting. There's the Tizer first thing in the morning.
Must read something, you know. Get up facts, catch drift of public
opinion, and that sort of thing. Tizer wonderful paper, though
takes a good deal out of you unless you 're in training. Always
after reading leader take quiet stroll through advertisements, public-
houses to let, or barmen wanting places, which puts me right. Saves
strain on mind. In addition to morning paper, got two Questions in
charge. There's Harcourt's Nosegays and the Vote of Thanks to
Army of Soudan. Settled nosegay business; must look up precedents
of Votes of Thanks. Rather think the Army would like it. Must
have heard of me sometimes. Gallant fellows, glad to do them any
little service, but, egad! mental strain tremendous. Can't keep up
the pace long. Shall knock off Tizer for day or two."
Another really useful evening. Seven cheerful nights we had on
Lord JonN Manners' Amendment to Franchise Bill. Conservatives
so greedy for Parliamentary Reform, can't get enough of it. So
Raikes to-night brings up Lord John's Amendment slightly disguised,
and agreeably proposes to commence debate "de novo, as Loud
Mayor says.
"Very well," says Gladstone; "seems we can't help that, but
you shall have.all the talk yourselves."
Wild indignation on Conservative side. "Cloture in most bar-
barous shape!" cries Randolph, preserving grave face.
"What f" gasps Edward Clarke, holding on to rail of benches
before him. Mean to say you aren't going to make any speeches f
Can't be true. Thought and said many bad things of you. Won't
believe this."
_ True, nevertheless, with slight exception. Harcourt, in speech
fifteen minutes' long, protests that he will remain silent. Seven
times over, in almost precisely identical words, states actual position
already defined by the Premier. Then Gladstone gets up, and, also
confining himself to quarter of an hour, repeats that he will not play
game of Opposition, and will stubbornly hold his tongue. So Con-
servatives have it all to themselves, and drearily keep the mill going.
Success of evening Tom Collins, who unfurls umbrella, and
sitting down under it, carefully parting coat-tails so as not further
to crush garment, occupied an nour and quarter in reciting speech
prepared tor Second Reading.
Business done.—None. How long! howlongj" cries Clatjdtan
Gladstone, throwing up his hands, with despairing gesture, towards
| gaslitroof.
Tuesday.—Duke of Marlborough favoured House of Lords with
his company. Took the Oath without slightest compunction. Met
him later coming out of Robing-Room, whistling " Marlbrook s'en
va-t-en guerre."
"With whom?" I asked.
"Ah! that depends," his Graoe answered. "Never be in a hurry
in these matters, Toby. My case, I know, is a little peculiar. Quite
a rush on Conservative side to get me as recruit. Liberals equally
anxious; so I wait. Think of forming Fourth Party in Lords.
People believe Randolph's got all the family cleverness. Mean to
show they're mistaken. Wemyss shall be my Wolff, and Bra-
bourne my lamb—I mean my Gorst. True Bra bourne not brought
up to Law, but naturally has a pettifogging manner. As for Wemyss,
shall have trouble with Jhim, I know. Will want to boss the con-
cern; but he '11 get over that in time. Not as fortunate as Randolph
in my materials. His opportunity unique; but must do the best
with what I have got. Mean to make Salisbury sit up, and Gran-
ville growl."
Fresh trouble for the Ministry, domestic rather than foreign.
Appears there's a revolt in the kitchen and butler's pantry.
Premier's young footman wants to know whv Home-Secretary's
young man should have been mentioned in Parliament whilst he
remains comparatively obscure? Fitzmaurice's second housemaid
has given a month's notioe that unless Ix)rd Edmond will bring in a
reference to her next time he answers Ashmead-Bartlett, she will
leave.
"I'm sure his Lordship wouldn't have no difficulty," said Mary
Ann, addressing the meeting. "Nex time he says, 'Praps the
Hon. Member will give notice of that question,' what's easier than to
go on to say, 'as I deeply regret to mention my second housemaid
has give me notice.'"
This all comes of Harcourt's persistent humour in answering
Onslow on the Nosegay Question. Ministers had quite enough on
their minds without this.
Business done.—Two Clauses of Cattle Diseases Bill agreed to.
Wednesday.—"How wonderful are the resources of Scienoe!"
Lyon Playfajr exclaimed, gazing reflectively at Farquhabson
seated below the Gangway. "No one regarding Farquhabson,
noting the thoughtful droop of his moustache, the massive forehead,
home of high intelleot, would suspect that he had a cow in his waist-
coat pocket. I onoe brought down to illustrate my lecture on Oleo-
margarine a few sample pots of grease; but I never went the whole
hog as Farquhabson does."
Quite true, though a little startling at first hearing. Fabquhabson
seconding Camebon's Motion for Second Reading of Cremation Bill,
incidentally produced cow out of his waistcoat pocket. All that was
mortal went into small phial, size of little finger.

Playpair himself apologised to House for not bringing down few

glowing with genuine eloquence.

Gad! I nearly smiled, myself when Harcourt talked about Commis-
sioners of Sewers disappearing in chariot of fire. Didn't see it at the
moment. Then other fellows had finished laughing; thought it
would be a bore to smile by myself, so gave it up. But doosed near it."
Business done.—Cremation Bill thrown out by 149 votes against
79. "The Bill an un-urned increment on the number already
rejected this Session," says Charles Russell.
Thursday.—"How do you doP" I said, giving a paw to Glad-
stone, as he stood behind the Speaker's Chair, chatting light-
heartedly with one or two Members. Chaplin, after thundering
around his Amendment to the Franohise Bill, had just bethought him
of the part of prudent General, and, amid roars of laughter, had
announced that he wouldn't go to Division.
"So near is Tragedy to Faroe," said Peter, whose kind heart had
been really thrillea by Chaplin's deep voice and awesome looks as he
addressed the House.
Hadn't spoken to my Chief for some days. Glad of opportunity.
"My good friend, Toby," said Gladstone, addressing Gentlemen
near. "asks how do I do. That is a question whioh naturally
divides itself under two heads. There is the How and the Do, not to
mention my own personality referred to in the You, which, if time
were not short and business pressing, might suggest a third course.
Then I have to ask myself, whether I shall first address my reply
to the inquiry, How, or to the assumption Do. Do what? I might
inquire of my excellent friend Toby. That would appear to be
necessary before, with due sense of public duty and care for public
interests, I should commit myself to a statement on the first part of
his question. Again, there is the assumption that my young friend—
young in years, but old in my acquaintance and fixed in my esteem
—may be using this phrase in its colloquial sense, simply inquiring
after the Btate of my health. That may be so. I do not too
confidently assume it; but supposing it to be the case,—and my
friend will oorreet me if I am wrong—I may say that the change in
the weather which we have recently noted with satisfaction and
pleasure (of course I allude to the alteration in the direction of the
wind from Easterly to South-Westerly, a change which sometimes
is not unaccompanied by extreme humidity in the atmosphere)
is a variation of atmospherical conditions that cannot fail to be
acceptable to persons who, like myself, have just passed through a
period of indisposition arising from relaxation of the muscles of the
throat. I have now given the best answer in my power, in the fewest
possible words, and I trust that I have made myself clear. If not.
and my friend will put down his question for an early day, I will
consult with Earl Granville, and if any more extended reply can
be made, I need hardly say how gratifying it would be to me to plaoe
further information at the disposal of one so widely and deservedly
esteemed."
"Then you 're pretty well," I said, gasping for breath, and finding
myself alone with him, the others having gradually slunk away.
"Thank you, yes," said Gladstone.
Business done.—Franchise Bill got into Committee.
Friday.—Rather a miscellaneous evening. A good deal of talk up
to midnight and then a little work. Raikes making up stories about
Hereford Election; pulls up Pulley, Senior Member, and reads

ALL-IN-THE-BLUE BOOKS;
or, The Precis of It.
Yesterday the promised Egyptian Despatches were laid on the
table of the Houses of Parliament. They comprise a great many
papers relating to the recent aotion of Her Majesty's Government in
regard to the Soudan, several, dated April 1st, having a special value
as bearing on the subject.
They commence with some well-considered recommendations from
Sir E. B-r-ng, as to the wisest oourse to have been pursued at a
period now passed. Concluding his despatch, Sir E. B-r-ng says:
"And now you have my opinion on the matter; and I have
nothing further to add beyond—that's all /'ve got to say about it."
In reply to this, on the following day, Lord Gr-nv-lle writes:—
"Yours to hand; and I think you may safely assume I am only
expressing the distinct, decisive, and unanimous feeling of Her
Majesty's Government, when I say that I do wish you would have
the goodness in future to keep your opinions to yourself."
A little later in the afternoon on the same day, Lord Gr-nv-lle
adds:—
"No offence by my last, of course; but you must surely see that
you, who are on the spot, are much less likely to have an apprecia-
tive understanding of what is going on at Cairo than Her Majesty's
Government, who enjoy the enormous advantage of contemplating
the situation from Downing Street. At the same time, you might
perhaps as well communicate to them General Gordon's views of
their recent conduct (this, of course, in cipher), in order that, should
any disagreeable questions on the subject, which Her Majesty's
Government do not for a moment anticipate, be asked hereafter in
Parliament, they may be prepared with a sufficient, oheerful, and
suitable reply. Meantime, 1 may venture to add that they would be
pleased to hear from you whether you consider it really as pleasant
a walk from Khartoum to the Equator in July as Her Majesty's
Government, acting on the advice of experts, have in their recent
communications officially assumed it to be.
Receiving no reply whatever to this despatch, Lord Gr-nv-lle, at
2 a.m. the next morning, changed the subject, and telegraphed as
follows:—
"Have been thinking about Gordon. Do let him know that even
if he hasn't a chance of ever getting baok again, his disappearance
will have added immensely to his high reputation. Pray impress this
upon him. Tell him also that no other man oould have produced the
extraordinary impression he created on his arrival in the Soudan, or
exercised the fascination he then possessed over the minds of a con-
siderable portion of Her Majesty's Government, checking, apparently,
for the moment, not only the advanoe of the Mahdi, but what was
far more serious, that of .the Opposition."
To this, in a reply dated the next day, Sir E. B-r-ng tele-
graphs :—
"I have heard nothing from Gordon for the past five weeks, but
the last message I received from him was to the effect that Her
Majesty's Government were ' a nice lot.'"
To this complimentary message Lord Gr-nv-lle replies in a lengthy
but cordial and appreciative despatch, whioh appears, however, never
to have been delivered at all, and the general correspondence closes
somewhat abruptly with the brief series of telegraphic communica-
tions hereunder subjoined:—

{A Legend of the Haymarket.)
"Pray, Sir, and what may be the painting on the Curtain P"
"That," I replied to the individual in his old-fashioned cloak who
sat beside me in the Second Circle, "that is a scene from the School
for Scandal."
"Upon my word you astonish me. I should know the play well,
and yet I fail to recognise it; but when the critics of the Pit are
driven into the Gallery, nothing should cause surprise."
At this moment the Curtain rose. We had a Street in Bath. The
houses were built of Bath bricks. There was a sound of a horn, and
it was evident that it was supposed that the Bath Coach had juBt
arrived. To carry out this idea, some of the passengers were seen to
walk off, others were taken home in Bath chairs by Bath chairmen.
There was a good deal of bustle on the Stage, but no talking. Then
an ostler busied himself with a stable, and an apple-woman tried to
sell apples. The other shops, to complete the illusion, should have
sold Bath chaps, Bath buns, Bath towels, and so forth. No doubt
these were round the corner, off the Stage. A bill-sticker posted up
a play-bill. A lamp-lighter carried across the Stage his ladder.
1' Why, what's all this?" cried my mysterious companion. '' Hang
me! but I think they have changed the Comedy into a ballet of
action! Nay, I am wrong. Here come Fag and Thomas. They
were played by Lee Lewes and Feabon in 'seventy-five."
Then for a few minutes we had the dialogue of the play. My corn-

round from seat to seat like horses in a circus." When the Curtain
fell he was extremely angry.

tate the mind, and distract the attention. Who wanted, for instance,
to see that Negro page bringing in the tea of Mrs. Malaprop t"
But he was loud in his praises of Mrs. Stirling, and said that she
was better than Mrs. Green, the original representative of the part.
This rather surprised me, as although old-fashioned in appearance,
my companion seemed to be a man in the prime of life. I could not
understand how he had been able to be present at the initial per
formance of the Comedy more than a hundred years ago, as he
declared he had.
"It was damned by the acting of Mr. Lee in the oharacter of Sir
Lucius O'Trigger. And yet," he added, with a smile, "do you know,
I'm certain I liked poor Mr. Lee better than I do Mr. Bishop! As a
Dublin.man I never saw two milder Irishmen in the whole course of
my experience."
And then he began complaining of the acting generally, saying
that the representative of Julia would have been better suited with
the role of Lady Macbeth, "a part admirably adapted to her voice
and person," and that " Simplicity," the maid, was only a "mode-
rately satisfactory soubrette.
He was not over-pleased with the Scene of the Third Act described
in the playbill as "A Room in an Inn." How did such a Soene
as that get there, he wanted to know. As Shakspeare had placed
the Witches on the heath, would anyone be warranted in making
their interview take place in a booth, at a fair of th« period, just,
Sir Lucius! They have misunderstood their cue. We ou^ht to see
nothing of them together until the Second Act, and then it Bhould
be on the North Parade."
But I explained that while "strictly preserving the text" (I

'that Mr. Bancroft and Mr. Pinero were jointly responsible for
this arrangement of the Comedy."
"Hang their impudence!" exclaimed my companion. "Why
shouldn't the scenes be changed in the tight of the audience?
and as for the transposition of the dialogue, I believe it is only trans-
posed to make the scene long enough for the performance of all that
super tomfoolery!" I begged my companion to be more quiet,
though, strange to say, his outspoken remarks seemed to attract no
sort of attention from the people around us.
When the Act concluded with a procession of a Bath chair headed
by a teroh-bearing footman, and a serenade sung seemingly by Sir
Lucius O" Trigger (I think I recognised his voice) behind the scenes,
the indignation of my companion knew no bounds, and he declared
that " they had begun by making the play into a ballet, and ended
by converting it into an opera!"
My strange fellow-playgoer was not too well pleased with the
scene of "Mrs. Malapropos Lodgings" in the Second Act. He
objected that there were too many chairs and sofas, saying that these
articles of furniture tempted the Ladies of the Company "to^move

forsooth, to illustrate the manners and customs of that time?
Certainly not. He wanted to know why Captain Jack was having
his head, powdered, and what authority Mr. Bancroft and Mr.
Pinero had for sitting Faulkland down to breakfast.

I am as much disappointed with the Gentlemen as with the Ladies. Certainly Mr. Bancroft
is capable as Faulktand, and plays remarkably well, but I am sure the Author never intended
Younp Absolute to be a mincing, posturing Macaroni, nor Bob Acres to appear as a grimacing,
capering, and half-witted country lout."
The next two Acts were passed in "the Tea-room of the New Rooms." Again my companion
declared that the Comedy was being changed into a ballet of action. He was not in the
least impressed with the supers playing at cards, and the grace of the Master of the
Ceremonies.
"It is indeed ridiculous that all these incidents should be jumbled up together in the New
Rooms," he observed after we had had the meeting of Miss and her lover, the quarrel-scene
with Faulklandand Julia, and the writing of Bob Acres' letter; "and if Mr. Bancroft and
Mr. Piitero are indeed responsible for the Btrict preservation of the text,' I wonder they allow
gagging by the representatives of Sir Anthony and 'Fighting Bob.'"
I oould not but admit that my companion had some reason for his complaint, although, no
doubt, the interpolations may have been sanctioned by tradition. His indignation, however,
culminated when we got to the last Act, showing King s-Mead-Fields.
"Why!" he exclaimed, "as I live they
have cut out one of the best Scenes in the
piece!—I mean where Jack disowns his
own father, calls himself Mr. Saunderson,
and says that the sword he is taking with
him with which to fi^ht his duel, is intended
as a bauble for Lydia! Oh, I protest it is
too bad! But perhaps they know that the
Gentleman cast for the part is not suffi-
ciently rollicksome for the situation I"
My friend had become so indignant that
I was quite delighted when the Curtain fell
for the last time, and we were thus able to
leave the theatre.
"I am glad it is over," he said when we
had got into the street again. "But it was
very trying. What made the success of
the piece wnen it was first produced was its
bustle, liveliness, and constant change of
scene. As to ' heightening the effect of the
Author's play without encumbering^ its
action' (to quote the playbill), that is all
nonsense. The constant 'business' of the
supernumeraries carried on while the prin-
cipals are talking, distracts the attention
to such a degree that it is quite impossible
to follow the dialogue. But there, it is
over! I had to suffer this heavy infliction
to regain the perfect Elysium, and I have
undergone my punishment. But oh, it was
hard to bear—very hard to bear!"
"Why, who are you?" I asked, not
understanding the latter part of his speech.
The form of my companion gradually
faded away, but I heard his voice answering,
"Richard Brinsley Sheridan!"
WHO WAS HIS HATTER?
Mr. Bancroft wrote last week to the
papers to explain why the Upper-box-dress-
circle Pittites and Galleryites hissed on the
first night of The Rivals. They had been
rained on and were shelterless. Mr. Ban-
croft explained why he couldn't give them
shelter, because, while making the shelter,
he had been compelled to pay, as he alleges
he was forced to do, £600 lor lettinga mere
iron pole fall on somebody's hat. let Mr.
Bancroft makes no allusion to the head
beneath the hat in question; and the ex-
cellent way in which its owner managed his
business share in the transaction certainly
looks as if it had received no sort of
damage. Why, then, £600 for a hat? Is
it possible that the Management of the Hay-
market, always bent on doing everything in
the best style, and quite royally, contrived
to get the matter treated as a crown case
reserved. This would have added, no doubt,
to the costs. The matter is brimfull of
interest.
As Clear as Crystal.
This is an age of Exhibitions. We have
collections of this, that, and t'other every-
where. But perhaps one of the best is at
the same time one of the oldest. The
Crystal Palace at Sydenham by its form
recalls the Palace of Crystal of 1851, the
father of all Exhibitions. The family tra-
dition has been preserved. At this moment
"Our one sight for foreigners" is filled
with an admirable collection of the trea-
sures of the modern world—glass from
Austria, furniture from Holland, and pretty
things from everywhere. In a word, "The
International Exhibition of 1884 " is being
held at Sydenham, and heartily deserves
success. If Londoners have the slightest
claim to discrimination and taste, it will
attain it.

GOOD MANNERS; OR, THE ART OF BEING
AGREEABLE.
No. IV.
Topics of Conversation.—If yoa happen to have been "well
educated," or what is accepted generally in society as well educated,
that is, brought up at one of the great Publio Schools of Eton, Win-
chester, Westminster, or Harrow, it will be polite on your part to
assume that the company generally, in whioh you may chance to find
yourself, have participated in the same educational advantages as
yourself, and, therefore, it will be well to introduce as early as pos-
sible into the conversation, anecdotes of the particular school that
has the honour to claim you as one of its alumni. [N.B.—Alumni,
alumnusx statu pupillari are good terms, as also are Alma mater,
Academic^ and curriculum. Avoid the use of such slang as "'Var-
sity," which is quite old-fashioned, and chiefly in vogue with non-
University men, who wish it to be thought that they were "up" at
either Oxford or Cambridge.]
Stories of your " Old School."—Let all these stories depend for
their point and humour on an intimate acquaintance with the school-
boy-slang of your time, and on a thorough knowledge of the persons
and places which you are compelled to mention, and with which you,
of course, will be perfeotly familiar. Should you find among the
company only one who has been to your school (before or after
you, it doesn't matter), address all your conversation directly to him,
and let it be all about Brown Major, or Thompson Minor, or Smith
Minimus; recount how, when Jones was Captain of the Boats, or
Brown Captain of Oppidans, or when one of the Masters known as
"Old Ginger" took the Upper Fifth during the illness of Stttbbs,
how Griffin Minimus was swished when Snifftn Major was the
real culprit, and much other equally charming and generally enter-
taining matter, from which your companions, if they cannot join in
it, may at least derive much pleasure and considerable profit.
Anecdotes and Impromptus.—Keep a commonplace-book by you.
The more commonplace it is the better. Do not wait to enter therein
only witty things, bons mots, jeux-de-mots, caramboles, humorous
stories, and so forth, or you will be a long time making even a small
collection, but put down everything you can remember when you
come home at night. For this purpose carry a small note-book for
quietly making menu whenever the opportunity offers ; good wrist-
bands will do, only mind that your mems do not result in hiero-
glyphics which, two hours afterwards, you yourself will find to be
hopelessly unintelligible, so that you will be puzzling yourself just
before goiDg to bed, and perhaps disturbing your rest in racking
your memory to know what on earth you meant by theBe marks on
your wristband, orjerky syllables in your jotting-book.
Preparation.—While dressing, whether to go out to dinner or
not, make a rule of always learning one or more of these stories
in your commonplace-book, and, invariably, one good repartee. Con-
versation, mind, is an art; with a partner, as at whist, you can get
on brilliantly. But without one, you must, as it were, "take
dummy," and play into your own hand. If you learn one story and
one repartee by heart per night, at the end of one year you will have
acquired a stock of three hundred and sixty-five stories, and the
same number of repartees. At first, when you have only one good
story and one good repartee, wait your two opportunities, say them
at the right moment, and immediately afterwards go. Let nothing
induce you to stop, or your reputation will be ruined. Go.' flu! and
then everyone will be wishing you had remained, and will be longing
to meet you again. But—A void that same company for some time, and
don't accept that host's invitation until you have mastered jive good
stories, and five repartees. When you have two good stories and two
repartees, observe the same rule. Never outstay your welcome jest.
To this rule there is absolutely no exception.
Never go to two parties in the same week when there is a pro-
bability of meeting the same people over again: but you may occa-
sionally accept two invitations to the same house in the same week
(when there is a four days' interval, which to you means four new
stories, and four additional repartees), since you may be pretty sure of
not having the same audience on both occasions. Recollect,—absence
makes the heart grow fonder. Play yourself well, and turn your-
self up as the right trump in the right place at the right time.
When unable to dine out, practise your stories and repartees, if you
are married, on your wife and family at home. Should you happen
to be a bachelor, don't stay in chez vous, but go and keep your hand
in at your Club.

UNHAPPY THOUGHTS.
(For Nervous Equestrians in London.)
At Starting.—The saddle doesn't seem to be quite tightly on. Dare
say it is. If saddle slips round, where should I be? Sounds like a
riddle. Wish the horse wouldn't look about him so muoh. Which is
the most slippery—the Macadam, the stones, the asphalt, or the wood?
If he tumbles down, which way .shall I tumble? Remember Assheton
Smith attributes his good hunting-seat to his having always ridden
in London with his feet out of the stirrups. Should like to try it, if
horse could be relied on not to take advantage of the opportunity.
The Street.—Hope that baker won't slam the lid of his hand-cart.
Where's that beastly bicycle coming? (" Gently—gently then—
gent-ly!") Wish bicycleB wouldn't come up silently behind, and then
pass with a rush. Don't wonder at a horse being frightened. I am.
Dogs ought to be always led with a string: at least, when I'm out riding Ibel ieve Hansom cabs don't care where they go.
Queries.—Why isn't tan laid down all round Regent's Park?
Why aren't there roads for Equestrians in Kensington Gardens
under the beautifully shady trees as there are in the Bois f And
another Gate to the Park through Kensington Gardens out on to
Bavswater side. What a ride it would be then!
In a Square.—Why will butchers drive at such a pace, and come
round corners just shaving the pavement! Here! Hi! What's
that German band going to do?
Rotten Row.—Equestrians are very selfish. They're bad-mannered,
too: or ignorant—or both. Why are these two Ladies coming towards
me on their wrong side? Who s to give way? Why should I if I'm
in the right? Then on that narrow bit of soft stuff round the Park,
intended for Equestrians, why will they—Ladies especially—persist in
riding on the wrong side? Rule. If you 're going slow and they 're
coming fast, give way to Ladies, scowl at their cavalier, but don't
yield an inch to groom. If you 're cantering on your right side and
they're going slowly on their wrong side, you keep on your way
and don't budge an inch. Consideration. If we collide, who's to
prove I was in the right? Rule. Only do it when you are quite in
the right, and a Policeman is watching. Wish they wouldn't practise
military signalling with flags in Hyde Park.
In the Street.—Why can't the Life Guards go from Fulham to
Knightsbridge without a band playing? They must know that some
horses are nervous: I mean that mine is. If band is necessary, why
brass instruments and drums? Why not only fiddles and flutes?
Much prettier and far more appropriate in piping times of peace.
Rattling carts ought not to be allowed. Wish that organman would
stop. He doesn't understand me. What's Italian for Stop " P He
only grins, and touches his cap. Washerwomen's carts that jingle
as if they were coming to pieces ought not to follow anyone on horse-
back (myself in particular) at a slow jog-trot. Most irritating.
Hansom cabdrivers, who are generally credited with something of a
horsey character, ought to know better than to drive rapidly within
two inches of your knee.
By Cumberland Gate.— Won't that 'bus-driver see that I'm holding
up my hand for him to stop? Is that cart coming right into my
horse's tail? Why don't the Police Ah ! —safe at last!
On Railway Bridge and near Underground Railways.—Why isn't
there some invention for rendering trains noiseless and smokeless P
Why aren't the London streets generally broader, with a good tan-
road everywhere for Equestrians?

the Prince of Wales and Mr. Somebs Vine! The Vine that has so
greatly flourished during the last two years—a wag would add, quite
what might be expeoted of a good Vine connected with equally good
Somers. But to business—for this is trifling.
To commence then: It was a happy thought of the "Authorities"
to usher in the Show; with an "Exhibition," kindly supplied by those
taking part in the inaugural ceremony, the more especially as the
chief actors in that ceremony " entered into the spirit of the thing"
with the utmost heartiness.
The season-ticket holders and the specially invited guests were
there in their hundreds and thousands. Apparently marshalled into
their places by more than half the entire police force of the Metro-
Eilis, were all sorts and conditions of men, from the humble and
yened waiter for copy for the evening papers (who accommodated
himself with a seat seemingly intended for the Editor of the Times) up
to Dukes, Marquises, and the great little Sir John Bennett himself.
For a good two hours (the impatient gave the period of time a harsher
title) the assembled throng waited for the approaching procession.
Occasionally strains of distant musio were heard, and it afforded
some amusement to those who watched to guess at the tunes to which
those strains belonged. It was triumphantly discovered that this
bar belonged to " The Lost Chord," and that to the "Turkish
Patrol." Then " Ood Save the Queen!" was played, and some
Ladies entered, and took their places on the platform. For a
moment, as one of the new-comers was elderly, it was imagined that
"the Duke " had arrived; but the rumour was quickly discredited,
as it was confidently expected by all present that His Royal High-
ness would certainly be clothed in his military scarlet, out of com-
pliment to the grand old waxwork figures in the Western Gallery so
nobly standing, ready to create merriment, in the long-discarded
uniforms of the Britisn Army of the olden time, and having evidently
so much to do with health—uniform health, of course. But the ancient
dame was identified with a Grand Duchess with an unpronounceable
name, and the excitement subsided. A few minutes later the distant
band again played the National Anthem, and the dais was shortly
afterwards occupied by the volunteer exhibitors to whom allusion
has already been made. As the collection was unique, to render it

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Perhaps the most remarkable personages in the above group were
the Lord Matok and the Sheriffs, who looked in their scarlet robes
(all the rest of the company wore morning dress) as if they had been
vainly attempting to obtain permission to stand as figures in a
Chamber of Horrors. They created so much merriment that Sir
Robert Walter Card en, who was seated immediately beneath
them, at once assumed, with his fine feeling of camaraderie, a quaint
old hat and a white woollen shawl worn across the shoulders to cause
a diversion in their favour. The clever ruse was most successful,
and the venerable and kind-hearted Alderman, immediately shared
with his colleagues the popular ridicule.
The Duke of Buckingham now read a long Address, composed prin-
cipally of advertisements and words commencing with the eighth
letter of the Alphabet, which his Grace took much trouble to pro-
perly aspirate. It is only just to observe that this trouble was nearly
invariably rewarded with suooess. Having finished rather abruptly,
he startled the Duke of Cambridge (who had been goinfj quietly to
sleep) into a response. The illustrious Field-Marshal leisurely pro-
duced some sheets of foolscap, and commenced reading with apparent
difficulty a reply. He was immediately hailed with a distant howl
of "Speak up!" to which request he accorded, by practical assent,
a more or less gracious reply. His Royal Highness stumbled now
and then over the sentences, and on one occasion came to an absolute
full stop while he peered, with an expression of "Hang it all! what
on earth is this word ?" at the mysterious hieroglyphics inscribed on
the paper before him. Where at this supreme moment was Mr.
Somers Vine, or at all events the Superintendent of the Literary
Department P However, all difficulties were at length surmounted,
ana, with a hearty declaration " that the Exhibition was open," the
oeremony concluded. Then the Duke of Buckingham seemingly
pointed out to His Royal Highness the beauties of two employe's of
some Photographic Company grouped over a doorway, and the im-
mense throng was once more (like the machinery) in ..motion. Two
hours later the general Publio were admitted, and inspection of the
other exhibits became impossible. Au revoir!
LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business.
Dear Gee-Gee—I mean G. G., George Grossmith,
You can't get away from the Savoy—(but you could if yon
would, as you are off the Stage for about an hour, and have only to
put on an ulster, and cross the road, to " come as you are" to the
Globe Theatre)—and so I write to tell you about Dickx which has
been out for some time. It is a New and Original Comic Opera, at
least so say Messrs. Murray and Jakobowski (isn't that a bootiful
name?!), its Author and Composer respectively, and I am bound
to believe them. So are you. The advertisements announce it as a
big success. I went to see Dick just to oblige you. How do I like
it? Well— how would you like it, if you had. seen it? First, you
would be immensely pleased with the title Dick, as the hero is Dick
Whittington. You would be charmed with Miss Camille Dubois as
Dick, who is a sort of Prince out of a Gaiety Extravaganza,'' with nods
and becks and wreathed smiles " to make up for any want of strength
in vocalisation; though what Miss Dubois has to sing she does very
nicely, and would do still better, you would say, without this straining
after a'' chio" style, which results in beingmore chic-a-leery than chic.
But what would strike you as novel is the action, and the stage-
business of the characters in every chorus. For instance, the girls in
the Girls' School are always bobbing, or nodding, or curtseying to one
another during the choruses and symphonies, l ou've never seen this
sort of thing at the Savoy or at the Opera Comique, have you? They
wouldn't do that sort of thing there, would they r Then there's a
Chorus of Aldermen in their robes. You've never seen anything
like that, have you? Not Peers, but Aldermen. What a chance
Sir Arthur Sullivan would have, if W. S. Gilbert would only
introduce this style of thing now and then, eh?
You would throw bouquets to Mr. Shine, who is really capital as the
Alderman Fitztcarren. When he enters, he comes forward and sings a
song, telling the audience how he came to be an Alderman! Ah, my
dear George, isn't this what you would like to do? A proud and
happy man would W. S. Gilbert be now, had it only struck him to
bring you on, in any one of his pieces, as a celebrity with a comic
song, telling them how you had risen to that position! What
chances Sir Arthur would have had if W. S. G. had only given
you one such song as this, telling them how you became a First
Lord of the Admiralty, or a Chancellor, or a Judge, as the case might
be! But it's no use regretting.
You would have interrupted the Comic Opera for at least two
minutes to applaud Mr. Charles Lyall as a sort of Pirate, in which
character he sings a song; with chorus of his followers, also a sort of
Pirates, all doing mysterious press-gang action. Isn't this a novelty,
eh? Oh, you'd pick up a lot of hints here! You would really enjoy
Dick's song, the School-girls' Chorus, and Miss Ethel Pierson's
effective rendering of Alice's song. Should you occasionally show an
inclination to nod your approbation of the dialogue, I should have
the pleasure of waking you to
notice the business of the finale,
which I have not seen so effec-
tively done since it was tried in a
silly Operatio Burlesque, called
Ths Fresh Waterman, at the
Opera Comique.
This brings down the Curtain
to a hearty encore, well-merited
by the spirited action of the entire
company, led by Mr. Shine,
though I'm afraid you would
have had to "cut it" long before
this finale in order to return in
time for your arduous duties as
Prince Poppet, or whatever it is
you are appearing as, at the Savoy;
the Carte would be waiting at the

With the Second Act, whatever
your opinion might be on seeing
it, I was much pleased. It doesnl drag, it goes briskly, the
music, if commonplace (except the cigarette song and chorus, whioh
is very effective and original in every way) is pleasing, and the
three Dervishes are amusing, with their dance and gymnastics. You

never saw Patience, I suppose? No; well, then, you do not know
that in that eccentric Opera three young men (who were they? I for-
get) became ^Esthetes, sang a trio, and danced the symphony. It
was very good; but oh.if they had only had the advantage of having
studied this trio of Dancing Dervishes before they did theirs!
Then they would have seen how each one could have sung his verse in
the centre and danced to the side, and how the man at the side could
dance into the centre to sing his verse, and so on. What a trio that
one in Patience might have been, had Sullivan and Gilbert and
their three young men, whose names I cannot remember, only seen
the "business" of this trio in Dick!
Miss Gladys Homfreys is a magnificent Princess (you haven't got
such an aristocratic name at the Savoy as Gladys Homfreys): and if
Signor Verdi had only witnessed the performance of the little black
boys with drum and dance before he wrote A ula, he might have made
his ten little nigger boys so muoh better.
You must put on a cloak, you can easily cover over your Prince
Poppet or Fairy Brilliantxna's dress (whatever it is,)—and run

Bonnet - Build ma.—The versatile and amusing "Madge" in
Truth thus describes the new " Artichoke Bonnet":—
1' The whole of the crown is covered with leaves made of moss-coloured
silk, exactly like those of the Jerusalem artichoke, and overlapping each
other in the same way. . . . Frills of dark moss-coloured velvet cover the
brim, and a bunch of buttercups and'what's-o'-clocks' form the trim-
ming. The strings are of moss-green terry."
The latter, of course, by kind permission of Mr. Edward Terry
of the Gaiety Theatre. (Song, "Farewell, my Moss-green Terry.'")
We saw several of these bonnets in fashionable circles, or rather
encircling fashionable heads; the other day, therefore we can assure
our fair readers that the above description is not merely a flight of
"imagination," but a literal fact. This novel head-dress is now
called the " Hearty Joke Bonnet," but it is only the clever Bon-
net eer—if she gets her bill paid—knows where the laugh comes in.
A Close Time for Whiskey.—In reply to a deputation from
Midlothian, the other day, Mr. Gladstone said—
"In Scotland the people had long enjoyed the benefits of Sunday closing,
and as soon as possible, without doubt or hesitation, the Government would
press forward into law the Irish Sunday Closing Bill."
It would be interesting to know whether the severe Sabbatarianism
of Scotland has been conducive to sobriety, and if the "whuskey"
consumed on that day is less than any other. Possibly these statis-
tics would be difficult to arrive at.
So Mr. Broadhurst's Basolution for the legalisation of Marriage
with a Deceased Wife's Sister was carried by a majority of 238 to
127! This is an example of what the House of Commons can do if
it likes to exercise its Commons' Sense. Those who are against the
Measure argue as if Marriage with a Deceased Wife's Sister were to
be made compulsory! We beg to inform the Lords that this is not so.

PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 5.—" So you see, Toby," said
Sir Stafford, "we've got rid of Randolph at last. Always sure
crisis would come. Often when he's heen standing at the corner
there, jibing at me, felt my blood boil. Longed to be at him; all
Cross and Smith could do to keep me down in seat. Glad now to
reflect that I preserved command over myself."
"Yes," said W. H. Smith, rubbing his hands nervously, "always
felt we took the right course. 'Give him rope enough' ever my
maxim."
"Quite true," adds Grand Cross, pleasantly polishing his spec-
tacles, "though must say that once or twice, looking in after dinner
and finding him on his legs,' viewing both Front Benches with strict
impartiality,' as he impudently said, I felt inclined to go for him.
Could have settled him in single round when my blood was up. But
as Northcote says, best as it is. Might have given me personally a
lift, but everything for the Party, say I; no washing of dirty linen
on floor of House.
"I suppose he really is knocked over for good?" I asked.
"Oh, dear me, yes, says Sir Stafford, uneasily glancing over his
shoulder and thrusting arms up sleeve.
"Oh dear me, yes," echoed Cross and Smith.
Just then Randolph lounged in communing with moustache.
Extraordinary effect upon victorious party. Sir S. Northcote sud-
denly grew limp, and brow clouded with look of agonised apprehen-
sion. W. H. Smith, strange pallor stealing over ruddy countenance,
looked straight over at opposite wall as if he saw a cockroach crawling
up it. Grand Cross abruptly absorbed in study of Orders.
"It's all very well for them to talk, you know, Toby," Sir Staf-
ford tremulously whispered; "but he's a terrible fellow, and though
of course we've got him down now, nobody knows what might hap-
pen. He might instruct Gorst to impeaoh us; or he might order
Wolff to take me up on his back and oarrv me clean out of the
House. Nice sight that would be—me astride Wolff's hack, and both
of us with our spectacles on! Wish he'd go away somewhere, and
leave us in peace."
Business done.—Army Votes in Supply. Joseph Gillis spent very
pleasant evening bullying Habtington, and insisting upon replies.
Delightful to watch Hartington with hands in pocket on Treasury
Bench whilst J. G., with thumb in armhole of waistcoat, judiciously
cross-examined him. Give a plateful of chicken bones to have had
at that moment Habtington's opinion of Joey B.
Tuesday.—At last in Committee on Franchise Bill. First Clause,
setting forth title of proposed Act, passed without debate or division.
"And they call us Obstructives!" said Chaplin. Made up for
it in Committee. Moved Amendments on every word as far as we've
got. Charles M'Laren, who has got some useful returns lately,
going to move for one showing when Debate will close, supposing
there is an Amendment on every word and two Amendments per
sitting are disposed of.
"Oh, we'll have it in plenty of time," he said, when suggestion
offered that Bill would be through before Return printed. Believe
printers have, in consequence of remonstrance, put on another boy;
if pressed, could manage short Return like that before end of July."
Cavendish Bentinck, in his ingenuous way, lets cat out of bag.
Grand Cross and the rest gravely protest passionate desire to see
Bill passed. Only want a few Amendments.
"Don't know what Gentlemen here want," says Cavendish.
"What I want is to see the Bill thrown out."
Cavendish seized by coat-tails, and, after violent struggle, pulled
back into seat. "Wash matter?" he gasped, giving an extra rumple
to his hair. "Haven't said anything, have I?"
"What with Sir Peel and Tony Lumpkin on the Front Bench,"
sighed Sir Stafford, " and Randolph below the Gangway, the life of
Leader of Conservative Opposition not altogether free from anxiety."
At Evening Sitting, Deceased Wife's Sister Question on again.
Bkoadhurst^ Motion, declaring relief urgent, carried by rattling
majority. Speech of the evening, Pat O'Brien's: characteristically
delivered in the morning. Beresford Hors solemnly sawing the
air at table, talking stale nonsense; nobody listening; House impa-
tient for Division. Sir Pat quells the turmoil with wave of hand,
and proceeds to make "political recantation." "The first in my
life," he adds, in tone of deep emotion, as if lateness in beginning
rather to be regretted. "The religion of which I have the honour of
being a humble member," Sir Pat says, with a gracious wave of his
hand. Speech full of historic quotations, personal reminiscences,
and topographical references to "the large manufacturing districts
of Lancashire and Yorkshire, where mills prevail, and masses con-
gregate." Sir Pat sat down after ten minutes' oration. No one quite
sure from which side he had "recanted," but quite clear that Henry
the Eighth is at the bottom of opposition to reform of existing
Marriage Laws.
Business done.—Resolution against prohibition of Marriage with
Deceased Wife's Sister carried by 238 Votes against 127.
Wednesday.—" Got a time-table in your pocket, Toby?" said
Randolph; "or do you happen to know what time the train starts
for Tusculum?"
"What, are you off?"
"Yes; I'm sick of this little game, and mean to leave them to it
for a bit."

"Oh, how d'ye do, Sir Bruin? And so you're leaving England for
good, and wi shall never see you again!"
"Nothing of the kind! Who says bo?"
"Oh, I saw it in one of the Papers. Bur the Papers don't always
TELL THE TRUTH, I 'M SORRY TO SAY!"
"Going as Tabquin went, or as Cicero? Is it preparation for war, or
leisured peace?"
"It'8 just weariness. I'm bored to death with the acrimony of Salisbury,
the feebleness of Northcote, the nabbiness of the Front Bench, and all the mis-
erable little scheming of ambitious mediocrity. I like a game of politics ; but let
us play up out in the open; say what we mean, and do what we say. This
manoeuvi ing and secret letter-writing, this communication of confidential corre-
spondence, and this stabbing in the back all round, sickens me. I '11 try Tus-
culum a bit. Thanks for your kind reference to Tab«uin. I think I '11 begin
with the other Party. What do you think of my using up my leisure by writing
a new Essay, De Claris Oratoribus, giving a short account of the eminent orators
of the House of Commons, from Hicks-Beach to Ashmead-Bartlett?"
Sorry to hear Randolph's going. House won't be the same without him. But
he won t be long away. As Harcourt says, " He's not the first young man who
has thought he d had enough of political life. Gladstone retired in '74."
Spent afternoon in discussion of Scotch Liquor Bill. "Tyranny of these
fellows makes one's blood boil," says Love Jones Parry. Here they've
Public-houses shut up on Sunday in Scotland, and now want to close them on
other days. If they don't mind they '11 have Scotland as disturbed as Ireland."
Much ill-feeling occasioned by Cameron's bold declaration (after all only a
quotation from Orb-Ewtng) that Dumbarton is the most drunken place in Scot-
land. "Suppose it's his native place," says Ramsay, " or he's got some friends
there, or he s speculating in property in the town. _ Mean attempt to play upon
Southern ignorance and crack up his own town. I know twenty places that '11
drink straight with Dumbarton, and Cameron will hear from them, too, before
the week's out." Business done.—Scotch Permissive Bill found not permissible.
Thursday.—Down for prayers to-day. Henry Lennox let me in for it.
"Look here, Toby," says he, yesterday afternoon; "you know a lot, but you 're
comparatively a young Member of the House. I'm juvenile myself in appearance.
But fact is, between you and me, I've been here some years. Take my advice.
If you want a seat to-morrow, you must come down for prayers, and secure it.
Got about that I'm going to deliver speech on Navy
Estimates. Shall probably not come on till about Ten
or half-past; won't be a seat to be had then if you don't
ticket it at Prayer Time. Here, take this and study it.
Give you clear notion how Navy's gone down since I
was Secretary to Admiralty."
Thrust into my paw paper with rows of figures. Sat
up half the night trying to make them out; but howls
disturbed neighbourhood, so had to give it up. Came
down to-day; got seat without difficulty. "Where's the
crowd?" I asked Lord Henry at Six o'Clock, when
W. H. Smith addressing Seven Members, including
Chairman of Committees and myself.
"Oh, it'll be here shortly," said Henry, turning up
his trousers. "Never understand," he continued, " why
these demd tailors make one's trousers so long in the leg.
Told my man wouldn't have 'em below the ankle, and here
they are nearly down to third button of boots. Like to
feel the cool air about my ankles, especially when going
to make big speech."
i Waited on. Things got worse; Six Members worn
away to Four. At Half-past Eight collapse imminent.
Henry Lennox ambling about the House and the Lob-
bies, delivering slips containing his printed figures, as
if they were tracts. "Going to speak presently, you
know, he observed with pleasant smile. "Oh, ah!
Yes," said Member addressed, and hurried off.
At Half-past Eight Chairman called on Lord Henry.
Henry wouldn't see him. Going to put the vote; all
oyer in a moment, and opportunity gone. So Lord Henby,
rising and surveying empty benches with ghastly smile
(meant to indicate that if he had a preference this was
the kind of thing he liked), went on, and in hearing of
Five Members showed conclusively why the Bellero-
phon's boiler had burst, or was goingto burst; forget
which; and how. owing to his (Lord Henby Lennox's)
advice being neglected, the gunwale of the Audacious
was scarcely ever dry.
Business done.—Navy Estimates. Long speaking and
short voting.
Friday.—Got two Bills referred to Grand Committee
at Morning Sitting. At Evening Sitting, House promptly
Counted Out. Fact is, Conservative Opposition a little
off their heads; letting things go anyhow. Randolph
has graciously permitted himself to be soothed. Salis-
bury gives him at once large slice of demand, promises
rest by-and-by. Great meeting of Party to-day. Ran-
dolph and Staffobd publicly kissed each other, and so
it's all right.
"Till next week or next month," says Chaplin, who
doesn't like turn things have taken.
ODE TO THE HANGING COMMITTEE.
By One of the "Skied."
Raise the gallows up on high,
Make them firm and very strong,
Standing up against the sky,
Let the drop be duly long:
Plant them to-day in the heart of the City,
And thereon we '11 hang up the Hanging Committee.
I've a picture painted well,
Near the ceiling they've hung me,
Say, how can a fellow sell,
When the patron cannot see?
Raise up the scaffold, then—who would have pity?
And hang up on high all the Hanging Committee.
I've a friend the Critics praise,
Who can doubt that they are right?
Paints far better than R.A.'s,
He's hung nearly out of sight:
And dozens will join me in singing this ditty,
"Go hang up the whole of the Hanging Committee!"
Mr. Punch begs to acknowledge the receipt of a box
full of the most beautiful Roses from tn? Nursery
Grounds—so they are quite young Roses—of Mr. W.
Rumsey, of Waltnam Cross. Mr. Punch has presented
them to several young Ladies of his acquaintance, and
retained some wherewith to deck his classic brow and to
wreathe the bowl at his symposium.

The Bill of the Alhambra.
LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business.
My dear Mb. Morton,
You are so engaged with the Leicester'Square" Empire, on
which the Sun never sets (which is a lucky thing for the Empire),
that you have not heen
able to traverse the nar-
row space that separates
you from Holland; I
should say, Mr. "William
Holland, long since
known as the People's
Caterer, and now the
supervisor of the Alham-
bra Show. Well,—if you
had been able to look in
there with me, you would
have been delighted with
the subdued and peculiar
tone of the decoration (for
you must be glad of some
rest for your eye away
from the gorgeous glitter
of your own bright parti-
cular place), you would
have been pleased to see
an audience which seemed
to fill every part of the
house, except a portion of
the Gallery, and, above
all, you would have been
immensely pleased with
The Beggar Student, which is about as well acted, as well sung, as
well danced, and as brilliantly put on the Stage as anything of this
sort can be.
What you, with your fine dramatic instinct, your knowledge of
popular taste, and real love of fun (for 'twas you who brought out
Genevieve with its inimitable Gendarmes, and its charming Offen-
bachian music, wasn't it? at the Philharmonic, eh *) would especially
applaud and be enthu-
siastic about, is the acting
of The Beggar Student at
the Alhambra. The Opera
has a good, easily-followed
plot (a trifie like the Lady
of Lyons—but so much
the better), and clever
Miss Fanny Leslie, in-
valuable for such an enter-
tainment, is the hero, and
the heroine is that pretty
and sweet songster, Miss
Marion Hood. Mr. Fred
Leslie is highly divert-
ing as General Ollendorf,
a sort of first oousin to
General Bourn of La
Grande Duchesse, with
the same way of taking
snuff that runs in the
Bourn family; while for
dash and go you would be
really pleased with Miss
Marie Williams, who
gives her lines with great The Beggar Student engaged with Ollendorf.
distinctness, — a praise-
worthy quality at these big places, where the talk goes for less
than it does at most other Theatres.
Fond of Opera as you are, you would, perhaps, after reading in the
programme that vou were to be treated to the '' Celebrated Rosa
Troupe" in the Second Act, be at first disappointed at not seeing
The Canterbury Pilgrims, Colombo, Faust and Marguerite, con-
ducted by Mr. Carl Rosa,—for surely this is the Rosa Troupe par
excellence,-—enter in procession, but your eyes would soon be sparkling
with delight, your feet would be moving in sympathetic action with
the first-rate ballet-musio, composed by our friend Mons. Jacom,
and played as only Mons. Jacobi's Orchestra can play it, as you
recognise the graceful, sprightly "Little Rosa," with her merry
companions, Anna, Kattle, and a Master Abrahams, who, I shrewdly
guess, from his name, must be of Hebraic extraction, though you
would not find it out from his make-up, for he is disguised as a
Lady of uncertain age, and the lot of 'em are as startling and
amusing as they possibly can be, without vulgarity. Then, you
would be in ecstasies about Miles. Pertoldi and Palladino, and, in

fact, you wouldihave'so thoroughly enjoyed yourself, that I should
have had great difficulty in getting you to return to your duties at
the Empire. You would be pleased to notice, too, how cleverly Mr.
Leslie indicates his capability of imitating the squeaks of mechani-
cal dolls, and the twang of a guitar. "It needs no Frenohman,"
you would exclaim, "to do this sort of thing;" and particularly
when it can be worked into the piece naturally, and become part of
the" eccentrio business of
the character, just as Mr.
E. D. "Ward's accompany-
ing his songs on his own
fingers was one of the great
attractions in Guffin's
Elopement, when Mr.
Toole couldn't catch the
Speaker's eye.
It's a " good book " this
of Mr. Beatty-Kxngs-
ton's, and I hope he '11
make as good a one on the
Derby, or leave it alone.
The grand Military Bal-
let-music, which I suppose
was written by Mons.
Jacobi, is an admirable
finish to an entertainment
which you would especi-
ally like, because there is
a clear, well-told story,
illustrated with sparkling
melody and continuous
action, which is never once
interrupted for the intro-
duction of any element
foreign to the nature of
the piece, and conse-
quently, as you would emphatically" say.'iit never flags—except
when they wave them in the Military Ballet—and is never dull.

Of course, whatever class of visitors may come, Directors cannot
complain of wanting More-ton.
Toujours d vous, as M. Jacobi wouldn't say, as he pretends not to
understand French. Nlbbs.
CALLS TO THE BAR.
The Bar Convivial is said to be quite as overcrowded a profession
as the Bar Legal. But one would hardly think so after reading the
following advertisement from the Daily Telegraph :—
BARMAIDS (two, young, active, about 48) "WANTED immediately,
for , Edinburgh. Hours 10 30 a.m. until 1116 p.m. Board and
lodging out. Photo ana references, &c.
Possibly in Scotland, where so much "whuskey" is consumed,
they require barmaids of gravity and experience. But if this
advertiser considers a Hebe of "about 48 " to be young, we imagine
he would account one of eighty to be middle-aged. It is marvellous,
too, to think that women verging on half a century could officiate in
a public bar for well nigh thirteen hours daily. But they are a
wiry lot in Scotland, and doubtless innumerable Baristresses will
apply for the appointment.

Keeping 'em Pianissimo ■ or, Three-fingered
Jack Obi.
BUSKIN v. RUSKIN.
The London Correspondent of the Sussex Daily News seems to
have mixed matters up and puzzled himself. He is angry with
Mr. Wilson Barrett, and says—
"But why does he call his eulogist1 John Buskin '? This is the way
the name is printed in the Telegraph to-day. One might Bay at ones that
the mistake was a printer's error, but for the fact that buskin is a theatrical
term. Perhaps Mr. Ruskin's enthusiasm for Claudian may be a little
cooled by this abuse of his illustrious name."
This Gentleman evidently does not read his newspapers carefully,
or he would have seen that John Buskin's opinion was on Paw
CUiwdian, and quoted from the Mall Pall Gazette, while John
Ruskin's opinion was on Claudian, and appeared in the Pall Mall
Gazette. Surely both these Gentlemen have a right to their opinions,
and should even John Tuskin wish to say anything on the question,
we fail to see that anybody has a right to complain.
Appropriate.—Cornhill, with its network. of overhead wires, is
now called Birdcage Walk.

cheist, and, lastly, of a well-known London evening'
paper, it has been decided to attempt to complete his
education. The matter will probably De taken up by the
School Board. It is rumoured that, as a move in the
right direction, some of the members of the Counoil have
Srepared a test. If the report proves to be true, no
oubt the paper will closely resemble the following:—
Easy Examination fob Lord Coleridge.
Theatrical.
1. What do you know about Mr. Irving besides the
facts that you presided at his farewell dinner, and made
a rather inflated and somewhat ignorant speech thereat?
2. Was Garrick an original member of the'palatial

3. Have you ever heard of Shakspeare? If you
answer in the affirmative, state in the following list
which you think were his plays—Hamlet, Box and
Cox, Ingomar, Kila's First, Othello, and The Cortican
Brothers.
4. Were " the Kemble family" acrobats?
5. Give the names of any three Pantomimes in which
you think Charles Kean appeared as Pantaloon.
6. Have you ever heard the name of Miss Mary
Anderson?
Literary.
1. Did Lord Tennyson ever write anything before he
was raised to the Peerage?
2. Is the Times newspaper published more than onoe a
week?
3. Do yon know how to read and properly pronounce
surnames of less than three syllables?
4. Name any Author other than Lords Lytton,
Macaui ay, Houghton, and the Poet Laureate.
5. Would you be surprised to hear that there onoe
was a writer called Coleridge P
6 and Last. State whether your reading has extended
to the Book of Snobs.
A Note for a Bow Belle.—The clever Authoress
of Dandie has struck the mark once more in Poisoned
Arrows, a Novel as full of points as its title. It may be
fairly said that Miss Jane Middlemass iu her character
of lady archer, is sure to find her latest shaft imbedded
in the gold of public favour.
THE LAZY MINSTREL'S SPARROW.
In the Times " G. F. C." told a strange historee—
But nothing to that told hereunder—
Of a Sparrow he caught, who became, when well taught,
An ornithological wonder!
But its exploits will pale, if you '11 list to my tale—
Though limits of verse are too narrow—
I '11 endeavour to paint, though my colours are faint,
My very remarkable Sparrow!
He has notions on Art, which he longs to impart—
He loathes the sesthetical swindle;
You will scarcely refuse to encourage the views
He has about Huxley and Ttndal.
He's a good hand at Pool, he can imitate Toole —
His wit is as sharp as an arrow—
He lawn-tennis loves, or a bout with "the gloves,"
My merry young versatile Sparrow!
He has thoughts, I '11 be bound, that are vastly profound,
On Coinage, and Thrift, and Cremation;
You will quite understand his opinions on Land,
On Housing the Poor, and Taxation.
Upon Chancery wards, and the Commons and Lords,
The merits of Eton and Harrow—
You will never gainsay, but regard with dismay
My most intellectual Sparrow!
He is glad to partake of a juicy beef-steak—
Of 'Thirty-four Port he's a lover;
He delights in ice-oream, and his eyes brightly gleam
O'er aspic of eggs of the plover!
He will often enjoy a good drink of the " Boy,"
And toast he loves garnished with marrow:
He is fond of game-pie, likes his Curacoa dry—
This rare gastronomical Sparrow!
Ah! he knows what is what. He can dance a garotte,
And warble Rossini or Handel:
He can play at piquet, smoke a mild cigarette,
And pick up the choicest of scandal!
You will not find his match in the leaves or the thatch,
Search England from Penzance to Jarrow;
You will ne'er meet a bird, I declare on my word,
To equal my wonderful Sparrow!
"HOW PLAYS ARE MADE."
The Pall Mall Gazette's Young Man has interviewed Mr. W. S.
Gilbert, Mr. Sims, and Mr. Pinero on this subject, and each of
these Gentlemen has given his idea of how Plays are made, or rather
of how each one of them would make a Play if he had it to do.
The P. M. O.'s Young Man of course came to us; but as it appeared
that he only wanted a receipt for Playmaking, we thought we would
keep it to ourselves, just as the monks of the Grand Chartreuse keep
the secret of " How Chartreuse is made " to themselves.
But as the above-mentioned Gentlemen have spoken, we have no
objection to offer a few hints which may be of some service to anyone
who is now engaged on, or who purposes to go to work on Play-
making.
First, then, the expression is all wrong. The P. M. G. wants to
know "how Plays are made." We will answer at once that " Plays
are made by the acting, by the fashion of the day, by public opinion."
Let the andience and the Press be unanimously enthusiastic abont
a Play, and that Play is made. How often do we hear he the Actor
or she the Actress " made " that Play f The Play was an indifferent
one, and the acting made it. Bad. acting can t "make" a good

make something of a Play. As, also, can historically correot cos-
tumes, bric-a-brac, or a dance. A Play has been sometimes made for
a mere song. Everyone went to hear Robson sing " Villikins and
hit Dinah as The Wandering Minstrel. We are credibly informed
that Mrs. John Wood's inimitable singing of " My Heart is true to
Poll!" makes the Milliner's Bill at the Court Theatre. This latter
song was, we believe, introduced without the sanction of the Author
of the piece, who, at all events, did not ask the permission of the
Author and Composer of the song. We presume, therefore, that the
Author of the piece knew nothing about it. Had we in one of our
numerous little pieces wanted to introduce a song written by Messrs.
Gilbekt and Sullivan, we should have asked their permission to do
so; but if our little vaudeville wasn't strong enough in itself, we
should not have consented to have had our Play made for us by the
work of somebody else.
So much for " How Plays are Made." The Public, in fact, "makes
a Play," and a Dramatic Author may say:—
"That this first night
Will either make it, or undo it quite."
Mr. W. S. Gilbert, with his genius for Topsy-Turvyism, says that
he always " writes the Last Act first." Quite bo: and then, probably,
he puts it first, and so gets it all wrong again. Mr. Sims is able to
say, that, from positive shyness, he has refused six commissions, as
the result of having written one Play is absolute "prostration "! Is
life worth living, Mr. Sims? Mr. Pinero, in giving his idea of " How
Plays are Made," gives us an insight into the privacy of his dramatic
life, and tells us how he finds himself, either in an anguish of tears,
or in fits of laughter. He does not tell us how he suffers, or enioys
himself, under the supervision of Mr. Bancroft of the Playmarket,
or how he writhes, or smiles, when " produoed under the direction of
Mr. Hare," at the St. James's. It was Mr. Pinero who tried to get
scent of the Hay-market over the footlights of the St. James's,—ne
has done some funny things in his short time—and haymaking and
playmaking are much the same to Mr. Pinero.
But how are Plays written ?—how are they composed? is what the
P. M. G.'s young and honest inquirer really wants to know, though
this is precisely what he doesn't say in so many words.
Here is Our Own Receipt from our Play-Book:—First catch your
Play; that is, your plot. Settle its locality. This done, go there and
imbue yourself with the atmosphere of the place. If at Venice, in
the Thirteenth Century, go to Venice, and be a Venetian. Take
your costume with you. Dress up as your own character, and walk
about,—the night-time is preferable for these operations,—acting the
leading situations of your own Drama. If Act the First is in Rome,
fo to Rome for the local colour. If Act Two is in Yorkshire, go to
'orkshire, and acquire the dialf ct. If Act Three is in Jericho,—go to
Jericho. Messrs. Augustus Harbis and Pettitt, who are engaged
on a Drama for Drury Lane next season, whioh is to be all about
General Gobdojt, have already started for Khartoum, and will be
soon riding towards that place to the inspiring air of "2'Ae Camels
are Coming." After this, they are going on to the Mahdi, and may
make it worth the while of the Mahdi, or Osman Digma, or both, to
return with them for a leading part,—they are accustomed to leading
parts,—in the new Drama. This is how to compose a Drama. As
tor the dialogue, that oan be written at Rehearsal. Give the Actors
the situations, and let them say what naturally occurs to them. You
(as Author) will note it down on the spot, and crystallise it. Then it
will sparkle.
To secure an effective finish to each Act, chuck all your characters
on at haphazard, arrange and rearrange their positions, as if you
were turning a kaleidoscope, until you have got one tableau that
strikes you. Fix it: and then try back, and lead up to the particular
and telling situation on which your Curtain will descend.
We shan't give any more hints. These are quite enough for begin-
ners, and ample, as satisfying the inquiring mind of the P. M. O.'s
Young Man, who seems to exolaim, as the naive and gushing Young
Lady did on being introduced to the Laureate: "Dear me! I wonder
now you manage to think of all these clever things!" Lord Laureate
would find it difficult to give a receipt for making a poem; and, to be
exact in our language, he has not made his poems, but his poems
have made him. As to how our own Plays are manufactured,—that
is, and will continue to be, a profound secret.

EXTEACTS FROM "GETTING ROUND AMERICA."
By Benedick Hamlet, Esq., of the Lyceum.
Edited by Joseph Hat-off.
This remarkable book, by our most distinguished English Actor,
has been anticipated with some curiosity. It will amply repay
perusal. Full of deep philosophy, brilliant in logic, unapproached
in diction, it will serve to increase tbe already world-wide fame of
its Author, and the takings at the Lyceum. A few extracts will
show the nature of this marvellous work. That it is one of the most
remarkable books ever published, is seen from the fact that it is sup-
plied with Two Prefaces! We give them both. By some error of
the Printer, the two are printed at the beginning of the First Volume
instead of (as was obviouslv intended) one for the First Volume and
the other for the Second. We trust this oversight will be corrected
in subsequent Editions.
Preface Number One. To the English Public.—The intense interest
and excitement which our American tour caused you, was apparent
from the frequent telegrams which I received from England. My
impressions of a country never before visited by an European cannot,
I trust, fail to increase your interest in me, especially as you know
that I have always valued the enormous and wonderful intelligence,
&c, &c, of England equally with the boundless hospitality and, &c,
&c, of America. Could I say anything nicer? If I could, I
would like a shot.
Preface Number Two. To the American Public.—My friend,
Mr. J. Hat-off, tells me you will be flattered to hear how much I
valued your unexpected kindness. I therefore say it at once. You
are a marvellously intelligent people. Other travellers may have
remarked this before, but—as I tell Mr. Hat-off—it has never
before been remarked by me.
My own share in this work is small. To my"friend belongs the
credit, and I may add the trouble, of writing it. If anything offends
you, put it down to him. Hoping that by a careful attention to
business, and the art_ of saying nothing unpleasant, I may merit a
continuance of your kind patronage, I conclude by observing that if
this book doesn't sell in America, I shall indeed be surprised.
Mr. B. Hamlet at Home.
Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.—Mr. Hamlet's Town-house is
close to the Bank. Consequently it is got up with East-end or Oriental
luxury. A monastic gloom is cast over the staircase by windows of
coloured glass (which cost £50 a square inoh). There sits the Cele-
brated Actor at his jewelled escritoire, while letters pour in from
every part of the world, demanding his autograph, a lock of his hair,
or a bit of his conversation "as supplied to Dukes, Earls, Marquises,
and the Aristooraoy of England."
In one corner is a collection of costly curios (including Mr. Hamlet's
secret recipe for a stage-stride) piled to the ceiling; in another are
dramatio treasures, such as the identical burnt cork used by Edmund
Kean when he played Othello. But this is not the only residence
of Mr. Hamlet: he has recently purchased a suburban residenoe at
Goose Green. And now, perhaps, we had better really get on to
America.
Mr First Interviewer.
Chapter 10.—All the Liverpool streets were blocked with dense
crowds of admirers when the Britannic steamed off. The local
Authorities were therefore happily unable to serve Mr. Hamlet with
a summons for obstructing the highway. It was pretty some days
later to see the New York interviewers, anchored on buoys half way
across the Atlantic, as they simultaneously made a dash for the
vessel. Several, we regretted to observe, were crushed to death in
their efforts to get in at the Fort-holes. Still, there was a large
crowd in the State Cabin, and the noise of sharpening of pencils was
deafening.
Mr. Hamlet entered. With easy nonchalance he began laying
about him with a large horsewhip, and then sank into a velvet lounge.
"Gentlemen," he began; "I am Benedick Hamlet I Tell your
Eublic that I already admire America immensely. I believe it will
eave in sight in three days, but I can tell that it is a magnificent
land even now. So are its people. So are you! Will that satisfy you?
What, more soap? Then 1 will fetch Miss Ellen Merrt!" And
so saying, the gifted Actor disappeared up the companion hatchway,
"He had no mannerisms!" said one Reporter.
"Oh, none whatever!" sighed a second, as he examined a large
wale on his left arm.
"And he can walk straight!" said a third, "and talk like a
Christian! Marvellous!"
A Word-Picture.
Chapter 12. {Extracted from the "New York High-Flyer,.")—
This, then, was Miss Ellen Merrt I A glorious creature! Lustrous
azure eyelids combined with an aquiline nose and matchless
profile to produoe the effect of a concatenation of superb grace
and lissom majesty. Not beautiful by ordinary canons, she yet con-
trived to give the impression of a being half Venus de Milo, half
Madonna. Her golden hair circled her alabaster brow like an aureole.
She was a born Actress!
My First Night.
Chapter 15.—The theatre was crammed! One hundred individuals)
unable to gain admittance, had committed suicide Seats in the
gutter outside the doors were selling at fifty dollars a-piece!
"Do your audiences ever applaud P" said Mr. Hamlet nervously
to a Reporter. "Because if they don't"—and he produced a rapier
dexterously from the calf of his leg—" I '11 let 'em know what I
expect!"
The success was grand! As Mr. Hamlet was sitting afterwards
in his own room, with all the chief speculators in tickets pouring
unnumbered dollars into his lap, he observed, "Your Public is a
remarkably intelligent one. It rewards genius heavily. For instance,
I should prefer that these dollars were paper. Tell your Public that
Miss E. M. and I are quite satisfied with them. Quite!"
And he strolled off to deliver what was universally characterised
a "consummate after-dinner oration" at a "small and early"
gathering of some thousands of admirers, at the Lotus Club, Broadway.
A Candid Criticism.
Chapter 27.—" What do you think of our country, Sir?" asked
the chief pork-packer of Chicago.
"Magnificent!" said Mr. Hamlet, as he rattled the last night's
twenty thousand dollars in his trousers-pocket. "That tornado
yesterday was grand. We don't have anythingUke that in England.
Then your manners are so refined. I was in Wall Street the other
day. What a sight! Purity and innocence reigned around. Some
of the child-like operators were playing at a game which I am told
is very like ' Puss in the Corner' in the old oountry, only yon call
it 'A Corner in Pork,' I think. You are a superbly and uniquely
greatpeople, Sir, a"
"Wal, that's pretty satisfactory. You've got a tarnation rainy
day to-day, Sirree!"
f' Rainy!' said Mr. Hamlet. "Is it indeed P I didn't notice
it. Evenyour rain here is superb—it never wets one,—it's far better
than our English fine weather. No, I don't mind anything I say being
printed—in fact I may add that I intend it."
Niagara.—An Appreciative Millionaire.
Chapters 32 and 33.—We were off to see Niagara. At the railway
bookstall Miss E. Merry noticed a lovely volume, price 500 dollars.
"Oh," said she, "it's too much. Take the nasty book away. I
can't afford it." Curiously enough, half-an-hour afterwards she
found the very book she coveted placed on her table in the saloon
carriage!
Who can describe Niagara P We were standing looking at the
scene from the American side.
"This is magnificent!" said Mr. Hamlet. "Itis, indeed, as I
believe others have remarked before, grand. What a roar! Here is
the sublimity of Nature. For the sublimity of Art you must visit the
Lyceum—or, at present, the Boston Theatre. This cataract is another
crowning proof of the grand intelligence of the American people!"
Last Words.
Chapter 156.—"Yes, I'm coming back "—shouted Mr. Hamlet.
with his head protruding from the funnel of the homeward-bound
steamer at New York, and speaking through a trumpet to the
millions assembled at the wharf,—"Catch me forgetting you! I
carry back with me the pleasantest recollections of my trip, and I
shall bank a good many of them when I get back to London. Bless
you all! Read my book—it will be candid and impartial, but you
won't mind that! My impressions of America have been delightful
—but may I say that one of the nicest of them is the impression
indelibly stamped on your magnificent coinage? Adieu and au
revoir.'"
"Cease, Rude Boreas!"
The House of Commons evidently thought the Channel Tunnel
too much of a bore, so they have taken the proper course with all
great bores, and have shut it up. Before the workings are entirely-
filled in, let us hope Sir Edward Watkin will once more descend,
with a bottle of champagne, and drink the health of Mr. Cham-
berlain.
Not a Case of Light Profits.—"A Loser," writing to a con-
temporary last week, complains that the cause of three fires, oconrring
within a comparatively short period in the same establishment—an
establishment popularly supposed to be capable of providing every-
thing at the shortest notice—had not been promptly discovered.

GOOD MANNERS; OR, THE ART OF BEING
AGREEABLE.
No V.
Vanity.—It is most true that Vanity is the cause of most of our
follies. Vanity is the love of admiration, however it may be
expressed. When you have sung, do not wait for applause, but
at once proceed with another song, and so on until your stock is
exhausted. The same rule will apply to recitations, poses plastiques,
conjuring, imitations of birds, and any other accomplishments with
which you may from time to time entertain your friends and
acquaintances, according to the advice previously given.
Farmi les Femmes da Monde.—Vanity leads men to wish to
appear successful among women. Do not make so great an error*
Don't "wish ;" he successful. Then you have a risjht to appear
what you are; it being of the essenco of snobbishness to appear
what vou are not. You know your own powers of fascination?
Yes. Then fascinate. And having "mashed" them all round, or
as many of them as it will serve you to "mash" for one evening,
strut about the drawing-room with your thumbs in the armholes
of your waistcoat, or both underneath your coat, flaunting its tails
defiantly in the air, as much as to say, "Ha! ha! I am cock
of the walk here! Regardez mon air vainqueur.'" This is
legitimate triumph: you, so to speak, annex so many of the fair
sex, and assume over them a protectoiate which insures them
against annoyance or insult. When you enter a room, silently but
quietly Belect your victims, taking them in order. Sit by their
side, address them individually as "my darling" or "my angel,"
adding, "I love you to distraction!" And then hiss in her ear,
"You are mine! mine!! mine for ever!!!" And so on with every
one of them. Do not boast of your success afterwards, but you
may walk about the room as above described, to the admiration of
all beholders.
Of Titled Friends.—If you happen to know (as, of course, you
will happen to know) several Dukes, Marquises, Viscounts, Duchesses,
and other grades of the aristocracy, neglect no opportunity of
lugging their names and full titles, if possible, into the conversation.
Mind, it is only the Snob or the Democratic Communistic Radical who
oan possibly object to hearing you speak of these distinguished
persons; while the truly-loyal, the well-bred, and better-informed
will be delighted, no matter how frequently you may allude to your
distinguished aristocratic circle of friends.
Let your anecdotes invariably commence with "I was talking
with Salisb ■ I mean, with the Marquis of Salisbury, K.G., the
other day, and I was pointing out to him how wrong he was, 4c,
&c, and old Sabum, I mean Lord Saxisbuby, at once replied,
'Johnnie, old man, you 're always right, but you know that,'
&c, &c."
Or when with relatives, at a family or friendly gathering, down
Hoxton or Camberwell way, you will delight them,—for they will
shine with the reflected light that comes through you,—by saying,
"I was stopping a few days with the Duke of Blucote at his
place down at Castletoff in 'Toffshire, when the dear Duchess came
up to me and asked me if I'd seen Jimmy—that's the second boy,
Lord James Fitziton—and I couldn't help telling her," &c.
Or, if you want to introduce a little variety, so as not to
seem proud, by mentioning a commoner, take care that the name
be associated with some distinctive place whieh gives a kind of
hereditary aristocratic title, as for example, "I was dining the
other night with Ned Wallop—not the Indian Wallops of Bawbee,
but one of the Wallops of Moke, you know—and he told me,"
&c, &c.
Or, if you have once been invited to some public gathering
which was graced by the presence of Royalty, when on your card
of invitation was put "To have the honour of meeting H.R.H.,"
&c, &c, you can say casually to your friends and relatives, "An!
apropos of that affair" (whatever they may be talking about, it
doesn't in the least matter), "there's something more than meets
the eye—I could tell you, only I am not at liberty to do so,—some-
thing,—but it mustn't go beyond this table. Well—the other evening
I was talking to—at least it is better to say I was in company with
the Pr—I snould say a certain Illustrious Personage,—when he
happened to ask my opinion, which I gave him and found it was
exactly contrary to his. Of course I couldn't retract." This has a
smack of true Republican sentiment about it whioh will raise you

in the estimation of your hearers.Vj" But—and this is what I always like in the
Pr—I mean, the Illustrious Personage,—so much,—he simply took my hand
and said, 'On my word, I never saw it in that light before. I'm very much
obliged to you. I '11 mention it to the Qu ,'—well, if I say it was tele-
graphed to Osborne in less than half-an-hour, you '11 understand me." '._ ' ;~
Well stocked with personal anecdotes of this sort, you will never want for a
dinner, and will be in the greatest request among those whose lives you will
brighten with such simple stories as those of which fair and sufficient examples
have just been given.
Information.—Be ready with an answer to every inquiry. Take it for
granted that no one in the company is better informed than yourself, and
though you may not happen to be invariably right, yet you will do well to
assume, hypothetically, that you always are, so that if anyone has the boldness
to interrupt you, and assert that you are wrong, the onusprobandivn.il rest with
him, when, if he cannot prove his assertion, he will only have earned for himself
the reputation of a meddling fellow who ventures to talk on subjects of which
he is ignorant, while you will have gained the respectful sympathy and the
esteem of the entire company. Whether it is a question of dates, or facts, or
private conversation unknown to the world generally, you must be invariably
ready to set them all right.
There are certain things which everyone ought to know: and you should be
able to answer at once if applied to,—as, for instance, some Lady interested in
Art asks " Who was Angelica KauttmannP" "When did Fra Angelico
live?" "Who was the celebrated Duchess of Gainsborough P" "Who was
Gainsbobot/gh?" "What was the Venus of Medici?" "Who was Medici?"
'] What was the Venus of Milo?" "Who was Mile?" "When did Pbaxitelf.8
live ? was he a pupil of Apelles?" As to ordinary subjects, you must be able
to explain what was "the Gordian Knot," who were " Amphitryon," "Nestor,"
"The Stagyrite," and so forth. In answering any inquiries as to these celebrities,
remember that anybody might be able to give a more prosaically correct
account of each one, but that the necessity of replying is the mother of inven-
tion; and invention belongs to Genius. You will prefer to shine as a Genius.
And mind—never hesitate, and never entirely retract.
Then, at the present moment, you must be able, with bread, or oranges,
or knives and forks, to describe exactly the position of Bacninh, explain why
the French are righting in Tonquin, point out the situation of the Soudan,
Cairo, Khartoum, Berber, the Nile, Constantinople, and the Pyramids. Be
ready to explain what is the distinction between Asia Minor and Asia Major.
Come out boldly with your information; don't hesitate, or pause; say precisely
what the Government ought to do, how many men have been sent, how many
ought to be sent, and then clearly expose the policy of Russia in Afghanistan,
and state succinctly and lucidly the action of Local Boards, Vestries, and
the Board of Works at the present moment. Depend upon it, that if you only
answer the questions put to you straightforwardly without hesitation, you will
be considered as a wonderfully clearheaded man, probably in the confidence of
Government, and you may safely bet that in any ordinary sooiety there will
not be anyone better informed on the subjects above mentioned than yourself,
or if there should be such a one present, he will begin to doubt his own accu-
racy, and after one sharp rebuff, which you will adminster to him straight, he
will not dare to pit his knowledge against your assertion. Should he do so,
and insist on his being right and you wrong, stick to what you have said, nail
your colours to the mast, unless you discover, by an adroit question as to his
sources of information, what position he holds, as, should he be the Attobney-
Genebal, the Lord Chief Justice, Colonel Bubnaby, or Lord Wolseley, you
will only have to withdraw one or two of your statements, under cover of an
attack on something or somebody else, and yield, with graceful deference,—but
still with skilfully-implied doubt of Aw facts,—to one who in his superior official
capacity ought to know—but who, as you may convey to your audience by a
side wink, or well-judged nod, evidently does not. In a word, when you meet a
notable antagonist on any ground with whioh you have professed yourself
entirely familiar,—merely, out of kindness to your company, and causa conver-
sations,—act upon the Government motto, "Rescue and Retire."
Authorities, Explanations, Instruction in Conversation.—There is an admi-
rable little book called The Child's Guide to Knowledge. Keep this on your
dressing-table: tear out the leaves carefully, and carry them about with you:
study them on every opportunity during the day. (Note.—Somebody might
profitably bring out The Old Boy's Guide to Knowledge; or, the Middle-aged
Man's Reminder. Most useful.) Learn at least one question and answer
per diem: this, with the good story and repartee, will occupy you sufficiently,
and within six weeks you will pass for one of the most learned and the wittiest
men of your time. I will guarantee it.
Assume safely that the majority are ignorant. Try them everywhere at
haphazard. You have a dish of almonds and raisins before you. Ask anyone
what is an almond, where do they come from, and for any information about
bitter almonds. If they go in for high Art and crockery, ask them how china
is made? what is biscuit china, what is porcelain, and what is delf? If you
can tell them at once all about raisins and give dates, explain the process of
painting, of engraving, and the manufacture of cotton, you will be considered
an exceptionally well-informed person.
Note.—What is everybody's business is nobody's business, and what every-
body knows, Nobody knows.

SSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JXTRACTHD FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 12.—"No spectacle in the
world equal to House of Commons on a big night," says Captain
Gosset, looking round at Five o'clock. "I ve seen a few of 'em,
but not many to beat this."
Not a vacant place anywhere—even the Gangway used as seats.
Side-galleries crowded. Speaker's Gallery and Strangers' Gallery
filled with throng beaming with satisfaction at recollection of crowd
outside that couldn't get in. For onoe Distinguished Strangers'
Gallery—usually occupied by friends and relations of Harrington,
Redmond, and T. P. O'Connor—put to proper use.
"A splendid House," I said to Sir Michael Beach.
"Yes," said he; "very gratifying, very gratifying indeed.
Randolph says I'm prosy; remarks made in other quarters about
lugubrious manner and sing-song intonation. These prejudices I
know generally lead to House clearing out when I rise; but acknow-
ledgment at last made, and very handsomely, too. Good thing for
Gladstone that he follows me. I expect many will remain to hear
him." Sir Michael, rising at Half-past Five, plodded on for hour
and twenty minutes. At Six o'Clock, Sir George Balfour and
Mr. Alderman Lawrence discovered sleeping side by side behind
the Treasury Bench, right in face of impassioned orator.
"Just like Babes in the Wood." says Caine. "Let's cover 'em
with leaves. Plenty of Blue-Books about, will tear up easily."
Presently, Lawrence woke with a start. Been dreaming he was

Thought there was something familiar in aspect. New Lord Mayor
jocularly announced it was the Last of the Aldermen." Shout of
execration at :barbarity woke Alderman—to discover Conservatives
vociferously cheering as Hicks-Beach, pointing across table to
Gladstone, quoted Gordon's words about "leaving to you the
indelible disgrace " of abandoning the garrisons.
Gladstone unmistakably riled. Generally when at white heat of
passion delivers his best speech; witness Thursday night before
Easter Recess, when he demolished Stafford Northcote, the Oppo-
sition, and their Motion for the Adjournment. To-night his speech
disappointing. Did not seem to get grip of subject. Certainly,
had not his usual hold on audience. Forster and Goschen
whispering together during speech. Fancy Forster means mischief.
Has a candid look about his face, and an extra wrinkle in the back
of his coat, that invariably presage an attaok on a Ministry that has
presumed for two years to get on without him.
Business done.—Yote of Censure Number Two moved.
Tuesday.—Wasn't wrong about the wrinkle in Forster's coat
noted yesterday. Came down in good time this afternoon, but waited
till Four o'clock to speak. That Deing the most prized opportunity of
the day, Forster calmly collared it, just as he shoulders Dr. Lyons
out of his corner seat. Government case looking little worse than
usual. Forster more venomous. Attacked Gladstone personally;
more than hinted that he said and affected to believe anything that
suited his purpose; sneered at consciences of Gentlemen below Gang-
way. Honest Hartington couldn't stand this. Went for candid
friend, hit out straight from shoulder, whilst Liberals uproariously
cheered and Conservatives sat ominously silent.
"Hang it!" said Newdegate, a fine old-fashioned English gentle-
man, "Forster useful to our fellows. Puts case in stronger way
than most of them, and should be encouraged. But don't like to see
a fellow bite at hand of old friend and Leader, because old friend
and Leader manages to carry on Government without him."
Goschf.n made it worse still for Forster, speaking an hour or two
later with equal force against Government policy, but no small back-
biting at old colleagues. Contrast a little hard on Forster.
Newcastle-on-Tvne contributed two best speeches in Debate.
Joseph (not Joey B., but J. C), rolled out, with his deep Northum-
brian burr, a string of perfectly-constructed sentences in antique
style of Clbth-of-Gold oratory. Regarded as a sustained effort of
high eloquence, this rarely been equalled. Quite in accordance with
dramatio turn of Debate to have John Morley following him.
Moved by excitement of moment, crowded House, the great issue
dependent, and strong antagonism to colleague's views, John at
last succeeded in throwing off feeling of restraint. Delivered dashing
speech, full of epigram, point, and argument. Having once broken
the ice, John Morley will fall into Parliamentary manner, and be
a leader in Debate.
Wednesday Morning.—Division taken at Two o'Clock. Irish
Members prepared little surprise. Gave out were going to vote for
Government. Conservatives in despair. Had hoped otherwise. With
Parnellite Yote might even defeat Government, or reduce Majority
to dangerous point. When House cleared for Division, Irish Members
remained seated, compact and highly respectable body, some thirty
strong. Other Members lingered in Doorway to see what would
happen. At last moment, Parnell rose, all the boys with him.
Stepped down Gangway, and turned sharply off to the right, heading
for Opposition Lobby.
"A twopenny dramatic effeot we could have very well done with-
out," growled 'Rowland Winn. "Glad of their vote, of oourse.
But why couldn't they have given it in ordinary way, without con-
spirator meetings at midnight, deliberately spreading lying reports
of their intention, and then this hanging about till last moment.

Thursday.—Randolph away to-night. Room for Toots Mac-
Iveb, Esq.. M.P. Toots has recently confined his letters to himself to
matters relating to finance, more especially in respect of foreign
duties. Sees clearly Chancellor of Exchequeb's hopelessly wrong
and determined to put him straight. Toots was not at Dr. Bum bee's
for nothing. No use telling him that two and two don't make five,
nor in disputing the truth of the axiom '' Seven from nine you cannot,
so carry one.'' Began at (Auestion Time with our commercial
negotiations with Spain, also in perilous condition; passed over to
Egypt; inquired into affairs in the Soudan; gave notice to move
rejection of Merohant Shipping Bill; had an Amendment to himself
on question of duties on foreign importation; and, popping up quite
unexpectedly when House finally got into Committee, made over
again speech delivered three hours earlier.
"Terrible fellow is Toots when once he starts. And yet no one to
look at him would imagine his head carried so much information,"
I said to Childees, who was beginning to fret under the perpetual
incursion of the irrepressible Member for Birkenhead.
"Yes, there's a good deal there," Childeks agreed. "But
don't you think it gets a little mixed and seems a trifle incomprehen-
sible when turned out?"
Naturally with Toots in possession House empty. Nothing par-
ticular going on. Gladstone might have had quiet evening at home.
Did in truth go out to dinner, but could not resist temptation to come
back and make speech on Budget affairs. Staffobd Nobthcote also
dropped in in same casual way, and between them they had a good
time for a hour or so, during which business was further delayed.
Mr. Toots proposed to arbitrate on differences, but House really
couldn't stand any more of him, and howled so angrily that he
abruptly sat down.
"Tell you, what Toby," says he. "I'm not the person to be
bullied. If they go on in this way I shall bring down my old friend,
the Game Chicken. "With him waiting outside in the Lobby they'll
think twice before they howl at me."

FRAGMENT OF BAS-RELIEF RECENTLY UNEARTHED BY DR. SLYMAN.
Supposed to represent the Olympic Games, Circa 1890.
HIGHLY SUGGESTIVE.
That what Lord Tennyson gracefully describes as Mr. 8. E.
Dawson's " able and thoughtful essay on The Princess," should have
brought down a fairly sharp rejoinder from the noble Poet, has
afforded much keen satisfaction to his many ardent admirers, and
his letter, published by a contemporary last week, has naturally been
hailed in certain quarters with something like positive enthusiasm.
Under the circumstances, the following postscriptum, apparently
written at a subsequent date, as a sort of supplementary afterthought,
but not published at the time, may be now read with interest.
Dear Sir, Farringford, April 1.
A few words more on the subject of plagiarism and sug-
gestion in poetio composition. The more I think of it the more I
apprehend the full and complete force of the unfairness of the
charge. Let me repeat it—I have not got my best lines by poring,
as implied, over back numbers of sixpenny magazines; no: nor by
continually ransacking the "Poet's Corners" in obscure provincial
papers. Homer, or even Shelley, with whom I am less familiar,
may have done this,—not I.
But let one give some still further instances, culled haphazard
from that observant period of my life, in which I was in the habit,
as I have already stated, of chronicling, in four or five dozen words
or more, whatever came home to me, with the full force of my own
natural experience.
I quote at random; but this from The Lotos Eaters to begin:—
"This mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon."
Suggestion.—Bathing, and getting out of my depth, with a party
of congenial friends at Margate, when Margate was quite the wildest
spot in England, some years ago. None of us could swim; the wave
was really mounting, and so I made the remark by way of encourage-
ment to my struggling companions.
Or take this again, from the same poem:—
"Is there any peace
In ever climbing up the climbing wave?"
Suggestion.—An extremely rough and disagreeable passage I had
between Dover and Calais. I positively experienced myself that
there was no sort of peace in the process whatever, and I think the
very question, as it now appears in The Lotos Eaters, I addressed
once or twice, at the time, to the steward.
To turn to a favourite theme—the Moon :—
"At midnight the moon cometh,
And looketh down alone."
Suggestion.—Opening my window late to see if the front gate is
all right. I have often, when doing this, Been the moon " looking
down," and, what is more strange, looking down alone." Some-
times I have seen a policeman too looking down the area, but I have
naturally suppressed him as not necessary to the context.
But here is a natural image got from an unexpected source:—
"I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,
Among my skimming swallows."
Suggestion.—Nothing more or less than an after-dinner skate with
my dress-coat tightly buttoned! L tried this on my own pond, and
saw with my own eyes, as I gloomed and glanced, my own
"swallows" skimming behind me!
But I will not bore you with a thousand other instances that
spring to my mind, ready with a flash to prove that the Poet, as far
as I know him, does not go to books for his fancies.
Why, even the line " There's many a black, black eye," occurred
to me as, when quite a young man, I happened to pass a party of
roughs returning from a famous prizefight; while the simple phrase,
"And with no language but a cry," was brought home to me,
through his daily but plaintive announcement of his presence, by the
local milkman. Yet when I printed this, some critic informed me
that language that was " a cry " was peculiar to certain wild beasts
at the Regent's Park Zoological Gardens, and graciously added that
"Mr. T. should not go to Nature, but to his tradesmen, for his
ggestions." And I had gone to my tradesman! After this, dear
Sir, what can I say more but that I am
Yours, &c,
Tennyson.
DITTY ON A DRAG.
The roadside gardens blowing
Are flush with flowers of
May;
Apace the grass is growing:
Let horses hope for hay.
The Gents, each other chaffing,
Their sides look like to split,
So loudly they are laughing
At one another's wit.
With buttercups inlaid,
Daisies upon the greenery,
Like gold and silver braid
And buttons, deck the scenery.
Their hues delight your eye
And charm your ideality;
Jokes whilst your friends let fly,
With playful personality.
But dull to you and drear
Is their liveliest inanity;
You 're a fellow without an ear
For the music of Gents' hu-
manity.
SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.
{From Our Own City Sporting Prophet.)

ment, having luckily got a very straight tip from the first cousin of
a celebrated jockey, whose name begins with an A. has borrowed a
considerable sum of money from his employers' till, which he fully
intends to return out of his large winnings directly he receives them.
My Own Prophecy is based upon a casual remark of the Secretary
for the Colonies—who ought to know something about the Derby, £f
anybody does—to the effect that it required a man to be very Wide-
awake to spot the Winner. From this I draw the natural conclusion
that he win be found in your H. A. T. Verbum sap.

Morning.—No Parliament last night—feel fresh as a lark. "Why
not a jolly day on the river? Local Government Board can Bpare

Hour or Two Later.—Here I am. Told the Committee yesterday
that "I'd been in the habit of using Thames and its back-waters
since 1863, constantly, both sculling and rowing." Question is, shall
I scull or row to-day? Neither—punt instead, andjfaA .'
Settled down to real enjoyment. Much better than Cabinet
Council. Poor old Glad hullo! What's that puffing noise?
London to Oxford steamer, as I live! Terrific wash. Thrown up on
to an eyot, punt and all, and covered with mud. Think I told Com-
mittee that " steamers had their advantages, because they wash the
mud off the banks." Forgot to tell 'em they washed it on to me
instead. Rather disturbing.
Had a bite! Watching float intently, when feel sudden shock.
Party of "'Arries," in pleasure-boat, run into me from behind.
Provoking. They don't apologise at all. Ask 'em "if they know
who I am?" Say " they don't, and don't want to." Tell'em I'ma
Cabinet Minister. They want to know "why I'm wasting my time
here, then?" Also inquire whether " the G.O.M. knows I'm out,"
and "what's the latest news from Gordon?" Very insulting.
Told Committee yesterday that "Publio behave themselves very
well on the river, on the whole." Not so sure about it now.
Hurrah! The 'Arries " have left. Now I shall have some peace.
A bullet whizzes past my head! Party in a punt comes round a
corner. They 're shooting at birds, I suppose. Shout to them—tell
them I'm a Minister, ana they've nearly murdered me. Idea seems
to tickle them—I hear them saying something about a " good bag."
They explain politely that " swallows trill fly so low," and that you
can't hit them unless you "take 'em low down on the turn." I
remark that J don't want to be taken " low down on the turn."
Think I was right when I told Committee that "river was a sort of
savage place—a circumstance which has its advantages and its draw-
backs." Being shot " low down on the turn " is one of the drawbacks.
Withdrawal of pistol-party in pursuit of a pair of kingfishers.
What Vandals! At all events, pistol-people, if homicidal, were
polite. Told Committee that occasionally on Bank Holidays,
rarely on other days, one hears a little bad language." Haven't heard
any to-day—that's one comfort.
Fancy, however, I hear some now. Yes, four hulking bargees
shouting to me! I try to get out of their way—get entangled in
towing-rope—really, their language is very bad! Tell them " I'm
a Cabinet Councillor." Seems to make them Btill more furious.
"You 're the blanked blanked bloke wot wants to shut up the publics
o' Sundays, are yer?" they vociferate, and begin to hurl stones at
me. Try to dodge. Why aren't the sides of punts higher? Believe
these men take me for Sir Wilfrid Lawson. How foolish of him to
rouse popular feeling like this! Bargees have stopped stone-throwing,
and ore now simply swearing. They can swear. In fact, I wonder
if they can speak without swearing? They probably don't mean
anything by it: but it's bad enough without any meaning, specially
when addressed to me personally. If it were in French, I don't
think I should mind it so much. Shall suggest this to Mundella.
He can bring in a School-Board Bargee Bill, to teach all Bargees to
swear in French. How will "Bargee Bill" like it? Manage to
make my escape, leaving all my tackle behind, into one of the
convenient back-waters, which, as I told the Committee, "I have
used frequently since 1863." "Personally," of course, "I have
never been molested." Lucky I got away now, however. Why
doesn't Haecourt put a policeman or two on the River?
Racy Moral Reflections.—" What's the odds so long as you 're

ing what the odds are?

A DANGEROUS "CONFERENCE."
SARAH MAC-BERNHARDT.
The Parisian Correspondent of the Times, or one of its Correspon-
dents, who evidently natters himself on knowing a thing or two
about the Drama, sent a plowing account, last Thursday, of Sarah
Bernhabdt's Lady Macbeth in M. Mabchepin's version of Shaes-
peare's Play. Of course she can do the Sleep-walking Scene; cela
va tans dire, in faot, the less said the better. Ristori was
immense when she played that scene alone, but a failure, here,
when the entire Drama was performed. The fact is, if the whole
Play is given, there is very little for Lady Macbeth to do, and if the
piece is produced for the sake of the heroine, it ought to conclude
with her Sleep-walking Scene, and when she has gone off, after
making the most of her stertorous breathing, and her gasping and
guggling, and her turning up her eyes till nothing but the ghastly
whites are visible (a very clever, but monotonous trick of Madame
Sarah's), then ought to rush on Macbeth (for whom no one will care
twopence), who, before he can utter two words, must be encountered
by the Physician and distraught Gentlewoman, who will at once
exclaim, " Mourante.' elle est mourante !" and before poor Monsieur
Macbeth can slap his forehead twice, and exclaim Mon Dieu!
mourante! ^Ma femme!" Lady Sarah MacBernhardt should
stagger in, give one last convulsive struggle, one last good turn which
doesn't deserve another, and then fall down—whop—with her head to
the footlights and her toes up the Stage. This is what our French
version would be, and, on second thoughts, we will have ours ready
and out next week, just to show what ought to be done, and give Mr.
M ahchepin I'auteur de " Blasphemes" a lesson in adapting our own
Immortal William. Who over here at all events wants Shaespeare
in French? And if we don't happen to have a Lady Macbeth by us
just at the moment, we will be quite content to wait till we get one
in English. Let Sarah B. take a few Ollendorfian lessons, and play
Lady Macbeth in the English as he is spoke.
TURFISH ATROCITIES.
Dear Mr. Punch,
I obieve to see a paragraph, too frequently, in the papers,
headed "Horses struck out of their Engagements." Now, I can
imagine a horse in his engagement requires occasionally, for the sake
of discipline, to be struck. But a man who would lift his hand to a
horse out of his engagement, save in the way of kindness, is not
worthy of the name of British Trainer. I trust you wiU use your
unbounded influence with the Jockey Club and tne Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to hinder a repetition of this bar-
barous brutality. Yours sorrowfully,

ON THE HILL-SIDE. A DERBY PUZZLE.
PrjZZLB FOB THE LONELY ONE WHO CAME DOWN "On THE CHANCE"—To FIND A FRIEND WHO'LL STAND HIM LUNCH.
THERE AND BACK.
There are very few things managed better in Franoe than in
England nowadays. Among them are the open places for public
recreation, the simple cab-fares, the feeding generally, and the Rail-
way buffets particularly. Nothing can be better for travellers than
the buffet at Calais ana Amiens, nothing much worse than the buffet
at Dover,—or at any other Station with whioh we are acquainted,
except Carlisle, for breakfast, and that other Station where the
"Flying Scotchman" stops to take lunoheon. But even these are
not served in the same dainty and appetising fashion as are the
buffets of Calais and Amiens.
With the out-of-door life of Paris London is gradually attempting
to compete; and the Healtheries (late Fisheries) Evening Exhibition,
with its bands, dinners, and alfresco coffee and cigars, and " sitting
out" up to ten or eleven o'clock, is some slight approach to the
enjoyments of Ledoyen's and the Cafe des Ambassadeurs.
But in the construction of their theatres the Parisians have still
much to forget and a very great deal to learn. As to the Palais
Royal, the sooner it is pulled down and reconstructed for the
comfort of the audience, the better. Dirty, tawdry, and stuffy, it is
insupportable just now: and the piece, Le Train de Plaisir, is about
the most stupid thing I've seen for some time. The mise-en-scene
would disgrace a barn, and the acting of the popular favourites is
about as bad as it can be,—at least so it was the night I was there,
when their performance seemed to amuse themselves far more than
it did anybody else, as far as I could see. But it was a very warm
night, and a scant attendance.
I saw in some of the bookshop-windows the advertisement of a
work by a M. Marchepin, the title of whioh. Blasphemes, is quite
enough to attract attention. The binding of this book, like Charity,
in one sense "covers a multitude of sms." It is, I believe, an
edition de luxe, and so may be said to be bound to obtain a certain
success.
The Salon this year is exceptionally good. Considering the
quantity, the quality is excellent, and, taken as a whole, our little
Royal Academy doesn't come within touch of the big Republican
Salon. If some of even the less important pictures were in Burling-
ton House, and signed with the names of Leiohto.v, Lono, or
Millais, there would be barriers erected, and Police stationed to
keep off the crowd of admirers, the Critics would be in ecstasies, and
the price would be thousands, in pounds instead of francs, and the
Painters all Millais-onaires.
One of the great merits of the pictures in the Salon is that they
mostly tell their own story. No need to turn to the Catalogue to
ascertain their meaning, as a rule. There is some rubbish, but not
muoh, in proportion to the stuff in the Piccadilly Show. There is
somewhat too great a display of the unnecessary nude, and of what
Mr. Gladstone might term bloodguiltiness " on many of the can-
vasses, which leaves a night-mareish impression after a first visit;
but, on a second, you know what to avoid.
And what is Hyde Park, for riding and driving, compared with the
Bois? Something might be done by including Kensington Gardens,
and mapping it out into sentiers with a point of rendezvous, some-
where by the old Palace. Here a first-class restaurant might be
established, and a military band could play at certain hours.
Fancy what our meet of Four-in-hands would be at the Cascade,
and what a real show they'd make in the Bois, to break off right
and left and go to their different stables after passing under the
Arc de Triomphe.
Wood pavement is being laid down everywhere. But though
stones make formidable barricades, they don't catch fire, and another
revolution may see the cremation of Paris with her own pavement.
The crossings are as dangerous and as badly guarded as ever. The
police are conspicuous by their absence. This we manage incom-
parably better in London, at the West End at all events. After all,
there's no place like Paris for a holiday, when weather is just such
as we've been having lately.
THE AUSTRALIANS r. M.C.C. MAT 22.
To Dr. Grace, Grace d lui and the first-rate team, we owe the
recent triumph at Lord's. "But 'twas a splendid victory "—and we
drop into verse, singing:—
The Australians came down like a wolf on the fold.
And Murdoch and Spofforth, they batted and bowled,—
But the M.C.C. met 'em, their story is told.
Some attribute the non-success of the Australians, on this occasion'
to the absence of Midwtnteb, and the presence of the splendid early
Summer. There is something in this, but not everything.

A MOMENTOUS QUESTION.
"I HEAR YOUR MASTER EXTRACTS TEETH WITHOUT PAIN I"
"Without Payin't Oh no, Sir! His Charge is Five Shillins I"
A WONDERFUL WINDOW AT ROYAT.
The Prince of Wales is having a good time of it at Royat. He
has a military band sent every day.—the Daily News told us last
week,—" to play under his windows —and to stop when ordered, we
hope. His Royal Highness is there for fresh air, not fresh airs from
wind-instruments. Nothing like peace and quiet; and of course a
real good military brass band playing all day under his windows, is
just the thing for anyone in search of rest and refreshment. From
his windows—His Royal Highness is supposed to be always at his
windows apparently, or heir-apparently—ne can " command a view
of Clermont."
Hooray for Royalty! He was born to " command," and why not
"command" views? But then why only stand at his window, and
limit himself to commanding a view of Clermont? He could, of
course, command a regular Panorama, and from the window at Royat
His Royal Highness could command views of Clermont, Richmond,
Oxford, Portsmouth, Calais, Biarritz, Vienna, Constantinople, the
Overland Route to India and Back by Petersburg, &c, &c, &c,
while the military band below should play appropriate airs for every
ohange of scene. What a delightful time I _ Le Voyage autour ae
ma Chambre was nothing to these possible views which the Prince
oan " command" from his window at Royat. And when all's done,
when he has commanded all he wants to see, he dines at six, smokes
the fragrant Havannah, and is in bed (the Daily Newt says) at ten.
"Early to bed, and early to rise,
Bless us! bow quickly the pleasant time flies!"
"The Dootor," says the Daily Newt, "insists on early hours/' and,
of course, His Royal Highness at this window can command the Doctor
to change his views too. There's another thing the Prince oan see
from tins wonderful window at Royat, and that is "the Mountains
rising." This sounds revolutionary, and our Prince won't like it.
We are sure that his presence will immediately stop any rising of
these Mountains,—some relation to "the Mountain" of the first
Revolution perhaps,—and that while His Royal Highness is there,
perfect tranquillity will be the order of the day and night.
OUR DERBY SELECTION.

HAvnro been desired to approach the great subject of declaring
the Absolute Winner of "the Blue Ribbon of the Turf " with a " per-
fectly virgin mind," I have much pleasure in complying with the
request. I can honestly say that I am quite unprejudiced. Until
this moment, I have never read the names of the Probable Starters,
although, of course, rumours (not always from a very trustworthy
source) have reached me from time to time of the doings of the
"Epsom cracks." Thus, it may be fairly said (as no doubt some, if
not all, of these rumours were absolutely false) that I have no special
knowledge qualifying me for announcing the name of the horse
that will be first to pass the winning-post on the 28th of May. This
being the case, I must put entire reliance upon my powers of pro-
phecy, although, as I have hinted, I have received some assistance
in giving the pedigrees and performances of the horses at the hands of
eood-natured friends.
To commence: Looking at the Betting List, I oome upon har-
vester. I am not a sporting man, but I fancy that this olever
cob was placed for the St. Leger a few years ago, and I am told
has been improving ever since. His enemies declare him a "roarer"
from the form of his running in the " Grand Prix " of 1881. but then
it must be remembered he bad scarcely recovered from the voyage
between London and Boulogne, which has, when all is said and done, as
much sea in it as river. However, Harvester has certainly a chance.
The friends of Queen Adelaide must have had great interest to
cause the rule forbidding fillies over seven years old entering for the
Derby being relaxed in her favour. No doubt the mare is as pretty
a bit of flesh and bone as has been seen for many a long year, and
could we but forget her performance in the Cambridgeshire, when
she finished in rear of Blue Gown, Silvio, and Hermit, we might
augur well for her success on Wednesday. As it is, she has a chance,
but only a chance.
Next we oome to Talisman, the representative of "the House of
Rothschild. If all I hear about him be true, this magnificent
specimen of horseflesh is already the sire of four Derby winners.
Surely what the descendants have done so frequently the ancestor
should have no difficulty in performing P And yet, remembering
what olever animals will be coloured in "Dorlings Correct Card,
one oan only spare to Talisman a chance.
.No doubt St. Midard and St. Oatien (each in her respective line)
are grand creatures. As stable companions they must have often
been tried the one against the other, and probably those at " Head
Quarters " could tell us which was the better mare. I understand that
St. Midard has frequently won the Criterion Stakes, and it is an open
secret that St. Oatien has had nearly every Selling Handicap at
disposal. This may or may not be true; but, admitting its accuracy,
on account of the uncertainty to which I have already referred, it is
impossible to credit either of the above mares with more than a
chanoe.
Had not Richmond won the Waterloo Plate in ibbu, 1 should feel
disposed to consider his likelihood of "starring " at Epsom a small
one. But remembering the magnificent finish of that brilliant
event, when he gallantly beat Harrow by three sets to two, it is
impossible to ignore entirely his prospects of success. He then, too,
has a chance.
I now oome to Loch Manza, the hero of the Elcho Challenge
Vase at Wimbledon for no less than seven seasons. It is reported
that the gallant steed is over-trained, but those who know the
wisdom of Mr. Justice Chitty in all his preparations, will feel
certain that the horse has not been sacrificed to any Putney fad. My
confidence is only shaken by the fact that when they met at the
Westminster Aquarium, Loch Bantu was easily beaten both by
Cook and Roberts. For all this, the grand old steeplechaser must
be honoured with at least a chanoe.
Lastly, I oome to Borneo and Bedouin, who together have done
wonders, I am informed, at Henley and elsewhere. The first, it will
be remembered, won easily against Surrey in a single innings at
Lord's, and the latter, it will not be forgotten, was equally successful
against I Zinaari at the Oval. Still, what may be done with impu-
nity in London cannot always be easily repeated on the Epsom
Downs. Besides, Borneo has never quite succeeded in getting over
the dead calm that years ago stayed her progress when she was
rounding the Needles off the Isle of Wight. And yet, to be quite
fair, a chance must be accorded to eaoh of them.
And now, having noted the prospects of success of the favourites
in detail, I deal with them in the aggregate. It will be seen that I
am not prepared to give an adverse vote in a single instance. The
race will go to the best horse, and the best horse is sure to be found in
The Field,
for which I therefore plump with the greatest possible heartiness.

A Lay of the Art Season.
I never was artistic, and I often used to boast,
That I knew no more of pictures and of sculpture than a post;
But it happens that the Lady who has stolen all my heart,
Is remarkable for Culture, and especially for Art.
And she visits us in London in this merry month of May,
When the Galleries are open, and she takes me round all day,
Till my head and eyes are weary, and I'd like to lay my bones—
Where I nevermore might listen to her raptures on Burne-Jones.
I have tried to be artistic, for she thought me quite a brute,
When I fled to get refreshment, from that weary Institute;
And I'm picking up their jargon, you can learn it all in time,
Though I caught it hot for saying Mr. Frith was " quite sublime."
Then she bade me worship Whistler, which was really quite absurd,
Though I found him when I met him an amusing sort of bird;
But his picture at the Orosvenor, that did stagger me a bit,
For it looked just like the phantom of a Lady in a fit.
Then I muddle up the Painters in so terrible a way,
And attribute cows by Cooper to the efforts of Millais;
While I hate myself for speaking when I hear her gentle groan,
As I vow that Ruth at Meal-time " is the work of Marcus Stone.
Then she wished I was an Artist, and I said of course I'd try,
Which avowal made her frantic, though I'm sure I don't know why;
I must learn some Art to please her, why to win her I'd be willing—
To take photographic portraits; case included, price one shilling!

Greenwich wants a Corporation all to itself, and " Why should
Greenwich wait?"
Her claims are various and irresistible. In the first place, Green-
wich contributes more than any other portion of the Metropolis,
always excepting the hospitable City, to the Corporations of Londoners
in general. She offers to the gaze of astonished mankind a splendid
three-decked "Ship," safely anchored on terra firma, and yet with the
steam always up, and her victualling department well supplied, and
her various courses, whether hard a-port or changed from East India
produce to West India sherry, always approved of. She can also
show to country cousins and inquiring foreigners all that is left of
Nelson's immortal victory, namely the " Trafalgar," and if any sea-
faring landsman wants a well-found "Yacht" for a few hours,
there ne will always find one, with a beautiful view of the river at
high, and a lovely view of the mud at low, water.
It also boasts of two Parliamentary Representatives perhaps un-
equalled in the whole House for usefulness. The consequence is
that Greenwich is never troubled with de Worms nor Bored with its
spirited distiller.
Greenwich also supplies Gentlemen and Ladies with the finest fish
dinners in the world. The courses begin at any hour you like to
mention, and are continued until exhausted Nature cries " Hold,
enough!" "Custom cannot stale their infinite variety," and all for
the small charge of thirty shillings, including sparkling Polly Naris.
With such claims, Greenwich repeats the question, Why should
Greenwich wait?" and pauses in vain for a reply.
If Greenwich succeed in her ambitious desire, it is said that her
first Mayor will be C. C. Wood bacon, Esq., one of the best-known
literary men in the City of London.

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Houte of Commons. Monday, May 19.—" I have been attacked!"
The O'Brlen shrieked just now, "and surely two words of explana-
tion might be permitted me."
This is too delicious. Makes me doubt Treveltan's judgment
that "Parnell's boys have among them less humour than any
twenty Irishmen taken at hazard." The O'Brien proposed to place
on Paper notice for "a Select Committee to inquire into alleged
prevalence of felonious practices amongst certain officials in Ireland."
A good many officials in Ireland. This would smite at them all.
Motion needn't necessarily come on; might stand on Paper for
weeks. Officials in Ireland indignant; but what of that? Clerk,
however, refused to accept Motion, so The O'Brien brought
frievance under notice of the Assembly he is constantly insulting,
ncidentally, in course of prolix speech, accused Sir Thomas Mat of
being in collusion with other Members to his (The O'Brien's) disad-
vantage. Gladstone interposed, amid general cheering; appealed
to the House to'protect Clerk, who could not answer for himself.
This was the " attack " of which The O'Brien, in voice trembling
with emotion and amid indignant cheers from his countrymen,
complained of.
Chamberlain had sitting pretty well to himself, with most pro-
digious speech of modern times. Began quietly at Six o'Clock.
Unsuspecting Members remained seated till Seven. Half-past
Seven, began to wonder whether they would get any dinner. At
Eight, certain they wouldn't. At quarter-past Eight, Chamberlain
filially observed, "And now, after these few preliminary remarks,
will proceed to address myself to the Bill." At half-past Eight,
Norwood carried out and laid on two chairs in Library. Palmer
got out his pockethandkerchief, and, secretly wetting it in tumbler of
water Eustace Smith had provided himself with in anticipation of
making speech, tied it tightly round his brows, set his teeth, squared
his elbows, and prepared for more. At a quarter to Nine, Mr. Toots
MacIver (with whom softening of brain had been going on visibly
with accelerated force since Seven o'Clock) began to smile with
increased feebleness and to chatter to himself. At ten minutes past
Nine, Palmer led out behind the Speaker's Chair. At half-
past Nine, Jesse Collings, whose personal friendship for President
of the Board of Trade has been tried in many climes, crawled out on
hands and knees, so that his retreat might not be discovered through
an eyeglass. At twenty minutes to Ten, Palmer, who had been
rubbed down with brandy, brought in again to move "That
this speeoh be now adjourned." Quarter to Ten, speech finished.
"Not because I was tired, Tobt," Chamberlain said. "Fact is,
I could have gone on for another hour. Rather fancy I discovered
sisjns of desire that I should do so. But it's well not to spoil a good
thing. Always leave off when you find your audience wants more.
That's my maxim."
Business done.—Second Reading Merchant Shipping Bill moved.
Tuesday.—Qrand Cross in a bad way. Persistently and success-
fully shouldered out of political power by Randolph, hopelessly
beaten in other fields of distinction by Love Jones Parrt, Sir Pat
O'Brien has now excelled his most famous phrase.
"I hear an Honourable Member smile. Grand Cross said one
night.
I k" I hear a twinkle," said Sir Pat, this afternoon, cocking his left
ear by way of warning. This beats Grand Cross by subtle distinc-
tion easier to feel than to explain. There is a notion of vibration
about a twinkle; can imagine a supernaturally delicate organisation
conscious of faintest sound. It is pretty, romantic, fairylike.
Bottom doubtless heard the twinkle of the blue bells moved by
the wind as he sat with Titania among the wood violets and prim-
roses. Whereas Grand Cross's remark simply fatuous. All the
difference between what Randolph calls "a bourgeois placeman"
and a rollicking Irish gentleman.
One charm about Sir Pat is that he always has two speeches on any
given subject. One is carefully prepared before he rises, and has
some connection with the subject-matter of debate. The other
occurs when on his legs and has nothing whatever to do with it.
Always delivers the latter. Course of remarks generally directed by
interruptions. "Order! order!" someone cried, when Sir Pat, sup-
posed to be discussing franchise in Ireland, wandered away to
Chicago and adjacent parts."
"Order!" cried the good Baronet, turning towards interrupters
with face blazing with indignation, "I am not in order."
Sir Pat when blood once up will oonoede nothing; contradicts
everybody. Wealth of illustration illimitable; drawn from all
sources, including natural history.
"I have my oie on the young sea-serpent from County Clare," he
exclaimed in warning tones, when Kknnt uneasily tittered at refer-
ences to subscriptions for the maintenance of Irish Members coming
from "Chicago and adjacent parts."
"Well, Idid me best," Sir Pat modestly said, when I congratu-
lated him on his speech. "I'm one of the Old Guard. I'm the
Father of the Irish Members, and a nice lot of boys I've got—you
know what I mean 1" What was wanted when I rose was someone
able to put the whole oase in a nutshell, and,—pardon me,—I think
I did it. Ye '11 notice that having given two sittings to Amend-
ment, as soon as I sat down House went to Division. Nothing like

keeping to the point, Toby. Take a word of advice from one of the

master your subject, then discuss it briefly—you know what I mean?
Don't be drawn aside by temptation to digress."
Business done.—Fresh split in Conservative Camp. Government
Majority run up to nearly 200.
Wednesday.—" As Randolph didn't go away, I think I shall,"
Sir Edward Watktn said this afternoon. "Tired of this narrow-
minded cramped little speok of an island. Wanted to link it to a
Continent. Wouldn't have it. Proposed to make an underground
roadway between North and South of London. Throw the Bill in my
teeth. 'A benefactor,'as it is written in Ecclesiasticus, 'receives
no benediction in his own country.' Have only one desire, to benefit
my countrymen, and I 've done something that way in course of busy
life. Comes a time when one's tired, of it, and it's come to me.
Chamberlain's at bottom of the whole business. But he doesn't
make public responsibility the less. Should like to have had Ha n
dolph s company if he'd been going, but must put up with my own."
House discussing and dividing on Motion that beleot Committee
meet to-morrow at Two instead of Twelve. Fact is, Cavkndish-
Bentincx, Henry Lennox, Tom Collins, and a score of others want
to go to Church, it being Ascension Day. Arthur Abnold suggests
they might get up at Six in morning and go. Suggestion treated
with contempt. On a Division, Church opportunities decided for by
93 votes against 37. Labbt going to move for a return showing how
many Members avail themselves of opportunity.
Irish Members last year got Bill authorising large advances from
Treasury to build houses for labourers. This year come to ask for
more. Trevelyan gently points out that it's a little early. Better
wait and see how Act works. Whereupon he is immediately sur-
rounded by the Boys, headed by Parnell himself, and kicked,
cuffed, and abused—all in a Parliamentary sense, of course. Pab-
nell openly threatens obstruction by way of reprisal; and William
Shaw, a born humorist, threatens that on next Vote of Censure
Irish Members will consider their course."
Business done.—Irish Labourers' Act (Amendment) Bill rejected,
Thursday.—House met to-night to pass Vote on Account of Civil
Service Estimates. Spent a long night; much talking, but no
reference to Civil Service Estimates. De Worms brought on a quite
new subject, to wit, policy of England in Egypt. Sir Peel, really
useful for once, suggested that Committee " should ignore the noble
Baron." Noble Baron dissented. Subsequently, nearly eaten up by
Wrathful Gladstone.
Afterwards we had Charity Commissioners introduced by Jesse
Collings; Russia's designs on India, of which Ashmead-Baetlett
has full knowledge; story of Crew of Nisero, told by Mr. Stobey
chiefly to his own credit; City of Cork Police; Limerick Police;
Irish Land Commission; and then the Vote on Account.
Friday.—Met Stratheden-and-Campbell (two single gentlemen
rolled into one—and plenty of room for more) coming from Lords'
Cloaking-room. Cloaked himself, brow bent in deep thought, and
walking, with ghostly tread, on tip-toes. Instinctively .looked at
right hand for dagger, but saw it not.
Beshrew me, my Lord, whither away, marry come up !," I said,
naturally falling into Shakspearian language.
"Ha! ha! Toby, is it thou ?" said his Lordship, halting suddenly
on his toes, where my interruption had caught him, or where, as I
might say, he had marry-come-up'd. "I was going to take a turn in
Westminster Abbey to round off few sentenoes about this Govern-
ment. Can't get rid of them anyhow. On Monday I carried Tote

way to daily labour lay by Hyde Park Corner, but rather than pass
it and witness spoliation, walks round by Primrose Hill. Asks me
to send him nine-and-sixpence to buy pair of boots. Scores of other
letters equally touching. Government must either submit or resign.
They have me to reckon with!"
Business done.—Franchise Bill taken in Committee of House of
Commons.
Bow-Wow.—M. Pasteur, of Paris, officially announces himself to
have just discovered an infallible cure for hydrophobia. "This treat-
ment consists of three successive inoculations of the hydrophobic
virus immediately after the bite." Let us trust this intelligence is
not too good to be true. May we—oan we—hope that it is not a hoax,
and will not prove to have been one of those canards that occasion-
ally fly across the Channel? His method of inoculation for hydro-
phobia seems uncommonly like the old "morning-after" remedy,
when the chippy one who could " strike matches on his tongue" was
recommended to take " a hair of the dog that bit him." We have
heard that it was an infallible recipe for the cure of that sort of phobia.

The Order of the Government was "Off with his Head! so
much for Wellington!" And this is how our Artist

LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business. To Mr. Augustus Harris, en voyage.
Dear Augustus Druriolanus,
Wherever you may be, whether on the back of a camel or
on your own back in a gondola, this will meet your Managerial,
Auotorial, and Aotorial eye. I promised I'd let you know what was
going on while you were away. Well—it's too hot to go to any
theatre that's at all crowded, and so I shall wait till the Public
generally is of my opinion, when I shall be able to have the plaoe all
to myself, and report to you about the lever du rideau called Chat-
terton, by Messrs. Beaumont Jones and Fletcher Herman at the
Princess's, in which our dear Wilson Barrett plays the leading
part, and I shall also take the first cool opportunity of seeing Car
and Tramway's—no, Care and Conway's—new Melodrama entitled
Called Back, at the Prince's. Those are the novelties, and the
revivals are Fourteen Days at the Criterion, and Byron's Upper
Crust at Toole's.
Perhaps John Lawrence Barrett Toole will produce a little
light opening piece called Talkerton, just to keep pace with Chatter-
ton. Of this latter piece I know nothing, except that Chatterton,
who preceded you in the management of Drury Lane, is memor-
able in theatrical annals for the saying, which appeared in a letter to
the Times, that "Shakspeare spelt bankruptcy." If he didn't
originate this, Mr. Dion Boucicault did it for him. I am credibly
informed, however, that it is " not Launcelot, but Another," whose
adventures form the subject of the laughable little piece at the
Princess's, which is performed before Claudian. A well-informed
person tells me that this Chatterton, played by Mr. Wilson Barrett,
was a Poet who killed himself because he had a row with his land-
lady, in consequence of being unable to defray his microscopical
washing-bill. He didn't intend to kill himself, of course, but only
meant to frighten his landlady. You, with your store of dramatio
knowledge, will call to mind that this is not a new plot for a Farce,
and is not unlike the Blighted Being, in which Robson was so
immense, but I dare say that, with his easy light-comedy ecoentrio
touch-and-go manner, Mr. Wilson Barrett rattles through the
part with great success, and finishes before the audience has time to
think. But, as I have said, I have not yet Been it, and it may be a
little different from what I have imagined.
The other Barrett, Lawrence the American, can't have had a
very high time of it at the Lyceum. You see our people didn't know
so much about him as his people did of our Mr. Irving. Who cares
for Kemble-like reproductions of Itichelieus and Hamlets and so
forth? Very few. By the way, our dear Wilson Barrett's (what
a lot of Barretts there are about!) rhetorical style is a retrograde
movement towards that tie-wig and stilted period which modern
sensationalism and the natural acting of farcical comedy had, I
thought, so effectively banished from our boards. 'W ill write when
I've seen these novelties. How's your new Drama with Pettitt
getting on? Is the Mahdi in it ?—Yours sincerely, Nlbbs.
The Pbovostshtp of Eton.—Strange that no one has yet thought
of offering this dignity to Mr. Russell Lowell. How^very odd.
We 're^quite beginning to miss him.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
SHAKSPEARE AT SOUTH KENSINGTON.
{A Legend of the Chelsea Hospital for Women.)
The Note taker stood in the oentre of the Royal Albert Hall. It
was nearly the last day of May—to be quite accurate, the 29th—and
three o'clock in the afternoon. There was a flourish of trumpets,
and a rather retiring person made a little deprecatory speech, and
declared " the Show open." Then a Procession was organised, which
included representatives of Science, Literature, and Art. The Pro-
cession passed by several Stalls in which the scene-painter and the
fancy-bazaar furnisher had apparently striven for mastery. The
titles of eleven of Shaespeare's Plays were written up above these
Stalls. The Note-taker followed the Procession. It was then that
he observed that a Gentleman wearing the costume of the Elizabethan
era, was walking beside him. He was rather surprised at this, but,
on consideration, came to the conclusion that the masquerader must
have arrived too late to get into the group allotted to him.
"Very pretty sight," observed the Note-taker, oourteously.
"Mcthinks it is grotesque," was the reply.
The Note-taker felt a trifle annoyed that his oompanion should
attempt to adopt the phraseology of the ancient time. The quaint
expressions sounded like verbal puzzles. Still, he could not but
confess that his companion seemed quite at home amongst them.
"This is not so bad," said the Note-taker, as the Procession
stopped before a Stall devoted to Hamlet and other fancy articles.
I like not Ophelia. Seemingly, she hath been drowned," was the
rather surly response.
A tableau devoted to the Merchant of Venice, followed. The Note-
taker glanoed at the programme, and found that six of the characters
were represented by persons rejoicing in the honoured name of Cox.
"Quite a nice little party, the talented Cox Family," he observed,
with a kindly smile.
"'Twere better spelt they their name with the 'e' final. Nay,
stay—here is one goodly Gentleman—he who plays the part of
Salarino— set down as 'Philip Coxe, Esq.,' with the additional
vowel." And then the Individual in Costume asked if Nerissa
was really wearing spectacles?
"No, I think not," replied the Note-taker. "She may possibly
possess a ' pinch-nose' (to translate French into English), but nothing
more. But what do you think of Shy lock f"
"Feeble," was the not too complimentary answer.
The Procession passed on, and paused before a representation of
the Winter's Tale and Measure for Measure. In the first, the
Hermione of Mrs. Coghlan McHardy caused some amusement;
and in the last. Miss 1 .ky lax d, by the choice of her costume, testified
to her thorough capability of distinguishing the Beautiful in Art—
everywhere.
And now the Note-taker and his oompanion came to a Stall repre-
senting a Scene from King John, and both gave way to uncont Tollable
fits of laughter. They certainly had some cause for their merriment.
The Archduke of Austria, wearing his armour and leopard's skin,
had not neglected to provide himself with an eyeglass; and a herald
in the foreground was also extremely funny. The wigs and false
moustaches of the Actors were again no doubt intended to promote
amusement. But perhaps the gem of the quaint collection was an
extremely genial tragedy queen" (intended either to represent
Eleanor or Constance), who sat in the oentre of the group, beaming
with the greatest possible amiability. In the background, serving
as an admirable foil to the "tragedy queen's" evident good-nature,
stood a truculent-looking Cardinal, cursing from the very bottom of
his heart the world in general, and the characters in that especial
group in particular. In the tableau representing a scene from
Richard the Third, a "tragedy queen" also smiled, and nodded
with much cordiality.
"0 Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo f" was all the
Individual in Costume had to say when the Procession paused in front
of a group containing several individuals in early Italian dresses.
"I am not surprised to observe now that I have seen their expo-
nents," added the Note-taker, sententiously, "that the parts of
Friar Lawrence and Juliet are filled by a Gentleman and his wife."
The Procession now hastily passed by scenes from Macbeth,
The Merry Wives of Windsor, and As You Like It, remarkable for
incompleteness of detail, and then the Audience and the Masqueraders
mingled together.
"What hast thou in thy hand?" asked the Individual in Costume.
"The Shakspearean Show-Book," replied the Note-taker, handing
a handsome-looking oblong volume (for which he had paid half-a-
crown) to his companion.
"A goodly tome," said the Elizabethan, turning over the leaves.
"The pictures please me much._ But what is this f And he pointed,
with much contempt, to some lines printed in such a manner as to
suggest that they were to be taken for poetry.
'Oh, beautiful star with the crimson mouth!'" read the Note-
taker. "Suppose that the heavenly orb must have been eating
black-ourrant jam—very quaint! And here again—' 0 ship that shakes
on the desolate sea! 0 ship with the wet white sail put in, put in to
the port to me. For my love and I would go to the land where the
daffodils blow! What an extremely injudicious choice of a convey-
ance! What a bad passage they will have on a ship that shakes so
terribly that even its sails can't escape a ducking!"
"And here," said the Individual m Costume, "'0 rapturous bird
with the low sweet note, 0 bird that sits on the spray.' Methinks
the rapturous and vulgar or low bird—for hath he not a 'low note'—
might find a more convenient resting-place! I see the name of the
writer is one Oscar Wilde—who is he?"
"I do not know," replied the Note-taker.
And then the two companions wandered hither and thither. They
listened to Shakspearian music, and visited a Shakspearian Museum.
The relics in the latter seemed to give the Individual in Costume
much pleasure, and he had a good deal to say about many of them.
"Fear not," said the Elizabethan at last, but I am going to fade
away."
"Fade away!" exclaimed the Note-taker.
"Yes. But, before I go, I would say that I do not think that my
name has been taken in vain if it has benefited that most excellent
charity, the Chelsea Hospital for Women."
"Your name ?" echoed the Note-taker, surprised at his companion
suddenly abandoning his old style of phraseology.
"Yes; I speak in plain English, because I wish to be clearly
understood. Cheques may be sent to the Hospital Account at the
London and County Bank, Victoria Street. As I said more than three
hundred years ago, ''Twere good you do so much for charity.'"
"Three hundred years ago!" gasped the Note-taker. "Why,
who are you?"
There was an empty space where the Elizabethan had been stand-
ing. But from every quarter of the Hall, as it comes from every
quarter of the globe, came the answer,
'' William Shaespeare."

PERILOUS PICNICS.
The head of a picnic party of nineteen persons complains, in a
letter to the Times, of a somewhat arbitrary rule existing in Bushey
Park. He says, that just as they were about to enjoy their luncheon,
a stalwart Policeman appeared on the scene, and informed them
that "no picnic party was; allowed to consist of; more than ten
persons, and that they must either divide or break up entirely."
This, which might be an admirable regulation in the House of Com-
mons, is scarcely in harmony with picnicular enjoyment. One would
like to know how far the parties of ten must be divided. Whether a
party of ten might dispose themselves under each tree, whether only
ten picnickers are allowed in the Park at a time? Especially we
should like to know if the Policeman in question was a practical
joker, and whether the Complainant offered him anything to drink?

TRUE MODESTY.
Mr. SpinJes. "I had such a beautiful Dream last nioht, Miss Bmoas!
I THOUGHT I WAS IN THK GARDEN OF EDEN"
Miss Briggs {with simplicity). "And did Eve appear as she is generally
REPRESENTED, Mr. SPINKS?"
Mr. Spinks. "I—I—I—I didn't Look I"
SWAINS AND SPARROWS.
"The Farmers' Club of Wirral haa just indulged in a caprice which deserves the early
notice not only of all lovers of birds, but of every person confessing to any feelings of
humanity. It is reported to have issued a notice, intended to be posted throughout the
district whioh has the honour to be within its jurisdiction, offering a farthing each, or,
rather, threepence a dozen, for sparrows and sparrows' eggs presented before the end of
next September."
Talk there is as touching Egypt—there may he a trifle more.
In the land of Egypt wonders, ye may know, were worked of yore.
Wot ye of the plagues of Egypt ?—Well, a word, then, to the wise.
Mind you on the land ye live in lest you bring a plague of flies!
Swarms of noxious winged things, and insects into them that turn,
Whioh the small birds feed their chicks on—as ye've got e'en yet to learn.
Therefore you the boys encourage useful sparrows to destroy.
Donkeys, for your own undoing so those urchins you employ!
Now, too, in the time of breeding, clowns combined in " sparrow-clubs;"
When the little birds are busiest, working off the worms and grubs.
Friends to you, and benefactors, if you must exterminate,
Would you not be rather wiser if till harvest-time you'd wait?
Know that, whilst the crop is growing, sparrows can't consume your wheat,
Have but little else than larva and the like meanwhile to eat,
Tarry until the grain has ripened and the corn in ear is brown,
So long ere you bid young bumpkins snare and stone and shoot them down.
"WHY SHOULD GORDON WAIT?"
"The Government going to employ an Expedition to relieve Gordon?"
said a prominent Opposition Statesman to Oar Own Lobby Loafer. "Why,
Expedition is exactly the thing they won't employ I"
GOOD MANNERS; OR, THE ART OF
BEING AGREEABLE.
No. VI.
Punctuality.—Time was made for slaves. Only the
slave is tied to time. Britons never shall be slaves;
ergo, Britons shall never be tied to time. Ton are a
Briton, and therefore are not tied to time. Tour fellow-
Britons forget this. They will be the better subjects,
the better citizens, the more loyal, the more companion-
able for being reminded of their freedom. Not by words,
but by the force of your example.
The Hour and the Man.—When you are bidden to a
dinner at the absurd hour of six or half-past six, teach
your host, what he ought to have known already, that
this is not the hour when the Upper Ten dine; not
the hour, in fact, at which you have been accustomed
to take your evening repast. Give him this useful and
admirable Society-lesson in good manners by arriving at
from three-quarters to an hour late, and all the company
will thank you, if not publicly, at least they will be
silently grateful to you, you having constituted your-
self the champion of their fashionable statue, and for
having made this dignified protest against the barbarism
of a man who will ask his guests to dine at 6'30; when
le beau monde doesn't sit down to dinner till quite two
hours afterwards. To be before the time at dinner is to be
behind your age; to be behind jour age is to be out of the
world; to be out of the world is to be dead and buried.
In the best Society when asked to dinner at 8'30,
you need not arrive till nine. In this case you will have
taken a substantial meal about four o'clock, and thus
provisioned, you may defy the assaults of the enemy.
Should you be the host, take for granted that all your
guests have dined before coming to your hospitable enter-
tainment. This view, as resulting in a slight repast of
one soup, one fish, one joint, a p/a< of vegetables, a sweet,
and cheese, with champagne (handed round occasionally
and poured into small glasses), and St. Galmier water
(handed round every five minutes and poured into
tumblers), will conduce towards economy and the preser-
vation of health. During dinner you can lecture on Sir
Henry Thompson's admirable book on Food and Feed-
ing, and strongly recommend your toast-and-water,
which may have been three hours in bottle and have
got quite a orust on it—or in it. Your guests will all
agree with you, and your dinner will agree with your
guests. It will only last a short time, and with the
last mouthful of cheese, you, having discarded the old
toping fashion of port and claret with dessert, will at
once have coffee and cigarettes handed round, and,
these finished, you will give your company to understand
that they have had as much as is good for them, and
that there is an end of the entertainment. This will
have lasted from say 8"30 (you, as host, must sit down
punctually to the moment, to show you are a gourmet
to whom one minute makes a difference in the cooking
of the fish or joint) to 10"0 at the latest, and your house
will be cleared by 10"30, and you in bed by eleven, as
your guests may also be if they follow your wise example.
Tims may hospitality and sociability be enlisted in the
service of health; for without health there is no true
enjoyment of life. Were my rules carefully observed,
mankind generally would be happier.
Rules.—Learn cards early in life. In choosing a pro-
fession, elect to become a Professional Whist, Piquet,
and Ecarte" player. Men of other professions may make
a large income, but they will not make it with such ease
and in such pleasant surroundings as will the Profes-
sional Whist-player. I select the Whist-playing profession
as being the top of the tree. It is one of the few Secret
Professions in existence. The Barrister, the Lawyer, the
Clergyman, the Dootor, the Soldier, the Sailor, must
advertise themselves; i.e.. must wear a distinctive dress,
and be much before the Public. The Professional Musician
must have his instrument, the Physician his consulting-
room, the Actor his Theatre, the Singer his engagement,
and so forth. But the Anonymous Journalist and the
Whist-player belong to two secret professions, in which
they may enjoy a lucrative practice for many years,
nay, even for a lifetime, without anyone discovering
what are the "means by which they live." Give the
Journalist pen and paper, give the Professional Whist -
Slayer his pack of cards, and both are furnished'for their
ight

A CITY CIRCULAR.
[Picked up near to Capel Court.)
Messrs. Bunkum, Jingo & Co., according to their custom, beg to
present their Clients with their opinion upon affairs in general and
the foreign policy of the Government in particular.
The Money Market is much disturbed, thus offering an excellent
opportunity to investors to operate to advantage. Enclosed in the
wrapper containing this paper will be found a list of excellent
securities.
Messrs. Bunkum, Jingo & Co. particularly recommend the shares
of the Mexican and Dismal Swamp Junction Railway Company, the
Bank of England North Pole Gold Mines, and the Heme Bay Resi-
dential Club and Champagne and Coffee Palace Chambers. All
these investments are now at an unprecedented low price, and must
ultimately yield large returns.
As to the Foreign Policy of the Government, interest centres
exclusively in Egypt. There is no doubt that had the Cabinet shown
more decision, the Daira would have been at a far higher rate than
their present price. Consequently, Messrs. Bunkum, Jingo & Co.
feel it their duty to point out the course the Government should
pursue, and having pointed it out, call upon every true patriot to
insist upon its adoption.
The British Army of Occupation should be immediately augmented
by 20,000 men. Half of this force should be stationed at Cairo, a
quarter at Alexandria, and the remainder sent to quell the disturb-
ances in the Soudan. The British Officials recently recalled should
be sent back to their offices, and every Egyptian employe" should be
removed. His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught should be
invited to accept the first Vice-Royalty on the occasion of the decla-
ration of a British Protectorate on the 1st of July. All negotiations
about a Conference should cease, and, of course, no arrangement can
possibly be entered into with France. All the above, although
excellent, are not absolutely essentials; and any one, if not every
one of them, might be easily dispensed with. But on one point
every patriot must be firm. The importance is so great, that a fresh
paragraph must be devoted to its declaration.
For the sake of all that is Right and Good and Just, to protect the
Honour of Hearth and Home, Country, Fatherland, and aU that is
Sacred in the Grandest Empire in the World, to advance the Inter-
ests of Civilisation and Morality and all that is Best in Poor
Humanity—in a word, to crown themselves with a Garland of
Immortal Glory, and to escape Indelible Disgrace, the Government
must, must, must Guarantee the Egyptian Debt. And when they
have guaranteed that Debt, Messrs. Bunkum, Jingo & Co., as
holders of large parcels of the Stocks indicated, will once more con-
fidently recommend to their clients the great advantage to be obtained
by the purchase, at a considerably advanced price, of Prefs. and
Unified. _
A TRILL FOR TENNIS.
Now Lawn Tennis is beginning, and we '11 set the balls a-spinning,
O'er the net and on the greensward with a very careful aim;
You must work, as I'm a sinner, if you
wish to prove a winner,
For we 're getting scientific at this
fascinating game.
You must know when it is folly to
attempt a clever " volley,"
Or to give the ball when serving"
it an aggravating twist;
Though a neatly-made backhander may
arouse a rival's dander,
You'll remember when you try it
that it's very often missed.
Though your play thrown in the shade
is by the prowess of the Ladies,
You must take your beating kindly
with a smile upon your face;
And 'twill often be the duty of some
Tennis-playing beauty,
To console you t>y remarking that All for Lawn!
defeat is not disgrace.
For you doubtless find flirtation at this pleasant occupation
Is as easy as at Croquet; when you 're " serving" by her side,
You can hint your tender feeling, all your state of mind revealing,
And. when winning "sets" together, you may find you've won a
bride.
So we '11 don the flannel jacket, and take out the trusty racket,
And though other folks slay pigeons, we'll forswear that cruel
sport.
And through Summer seek a haven on the sward so smoothly shaven,
With the whitened lines en regie for a neat Lawn Tennis Court.

SARAH'S MACBETH.
Heal Sarcey Criticisms.
This is indeed a triumph of French Art. The ragged British Bard
has long needed this interpretation, this rehabilitation, may I say?
Old Drury (the historic house, where the Comedy of Verona was first
played before Queen Elizabeth, and where M. Barhett-Irvimg
no w revives Williams with signal success)—Old Drury is a wretched
ruin without the Porte St. Martin to lean against. Last night's
triumph has conclusively proved that Shakspeare is only perfect in
a -French dress.
To begin with: The Poet's compatriots are accustomed to make the
scenes in which the action takes place simple rough mountainous
landscapes. We have made the Witches' Heath as much like the
Blaine de Saint Denis as possible, and we allowed Scotland scarcely
any mountains at all, which ought to please her, as it will prevent
tourists from rushing to disturb her in her eternal contemplation of
Bien Lhomond—so called after the French grammarian. Then the
idea of making the Castle Court a kind of a reduotion of the Place
du Carrousel is distinctly a progress in intelligent realism such as
would never have occurred to M. Barrett-Irving; while the
Moorish style of the Palace Chambers is entirely suited to a repre-
sentation of Scotland in the eleventh century. Besides, if it isn't, it
is a good deal prettier than their bare stone walls, their rush-covered
floors, and hard naked settees. Seeing them, people would have said
we hadn't a sou to spend on the mise-en-tcene.
As for the costumes, no English Management has ever approached
them for magnificent originality. There has been an English Sarah,
we believe, some Semble, or Kjddons, but she played Milady Mac-
beth in simple black velvet, while our Sabah bids her husband
harbouille de sang les valets endormis, in a white jersey with flannel
epaulettes. Then she had a girdle, and her hair down—and her
hair is really Scotch at any rate. Then she had a yellow jersey
for the banquet, with blue lozenges. But it is perhaps a pity that
she abandoned her original intention of appearing in the national
kilt: Sarah in a kilt would have eclipsed Mr. Irving in one onoe
and for all time. M. Mahais and the men showed, too, a wise dis-
cretion in rejecting the barbarous costume of the Heeglandes and
appearing in elegant raiment, after the fashion of Francis the
First: eminently suited for a cold climate and people who are in the
habit of associating with witches. MM. Joi.iet, J ecu, and Magnieu,
as the Witches, by the bye, were perfection. No English Witohes
were ever half so polished and clean.
The acting is all Sarah's. It always is. She reads the letter like
a Greek Sappho, and she somnambulises like a Hindu serpent-charmer.
She isn't precisely a Scotch murderess of the Middle Ages, but then
she is Sarah, and that's enough for anybody not savage enough to
prefer—truth.
THE LAST OF THE MAY MEETINGS.
A long - postponed meeting between Mr. Justice Lockemcp and
Mr. Charles Bates at the Old Bailey.
Meeting of Irish Nationalists to invite Lord Randolph to stand
for Cork, as a Home-Ruler, together with Mr. Parnell.
Meeting of the " Derby Winner " with the Derby Loser.
Meeting of the Head of the Fourth Party with Mr. Fawcett's
Elementary Manual of Political Economy.
Gathering of the "Dandelion Duffers" and the "Buttercup
Buffers," with a view to amalgamation with the " Primrose Patriots.
And, finally—beBt and most improbable of all—meeting of General
Gordon and his rescuers in the citadel of Khartoum. (Only, if the
Mahdi has his way, this seems likely to be a Mayn't Meeting.)

HOW PLAYS AEE PLACED.
(By Some of Those who have Ma naged it.)
Ths frank hut somewhat indiscreet revelations as to the method
and manner of making and writing plays, that have recently found
a place in the pages of our spirited contemporary, the Pall Mall
Gazette, can scarcely have failed to have produced one inevitable
result. With such a handbook of construction before them, many
hesitating but aspiring Dramatists must have instantly set to work
to tlood the theatrical market, and it is more than probable that, at
the present moment, dozens of high-class comedies, burlesques, five-
act dramas, and miscellaneous pieces in anything from one to fifteen
tableaux, are nearing completion.
For, with so many veteran adepts and experts to direct and guide
him, the untried if ambitious Dramatist can scarcely go wrong.
Indeed, now that the whole secret is out, it cannot be a matter of
any difficulty either to make or to write a Flay.
But this is only half the battle. It is one thing to write a play—
another to get it produced. _ And if it is a first play into the bargain,
the matter, without a certain technical knowledge acquired at the
Stage-door, becomes practically impossible.
A good deal of disappointment must therefore be in store for the
coming flock of Authors, unless, having mastered the art of "con-
struction," they also manage to familiarise themselves with the
even more important art, the art of " production."
With a view to helping them in the latter difficulty, the following
communications, furnished, on solicitation, by several leading Dra-
matic Authors, who have briefly set down their own first experiences
in the matter, will be found not only useful but encouraging. It is
needless to point out that, for obvious reasons, names are sup-
pressed :—
From *.
You ask'me to tell your readers briefly how I managed to get my
first Flay accepted. It is not an easy task to do this in a few words.
The process was neither swift nor simple. But I set to work in this
way. Having sent my Play (a carefully-written tragic work, in a
Prologue and four or five Acts, with some slight comic interest intro-
duced) to the Manager of a noted West-End Theatre, naming my
terms, and saying that I should expect an answer the following day,
on hearing nothing from him for nearly a week, I called at the
Stage-door for an explanation. Getting none, I.had to continue my
inquiries, with the same result, daily for nine months, when I was
finally, as matters had now come nearly to a crisis with the door-
keeper, felled with a blow from my own manuscript, a heavy and
dangerous weapon when used aggressively. After a couple of cross-
summonses at a police-court, which cost me £2 155. 6d., I tried
several other metropolitan Theatres with a somewhat similar result,
eventually getting my really first satisfactory Managerial interview,
quite by a lucky chance, with the proprietor of a Circus, who,
through some mistake, understood that I had called about the pur-
chase of an invalid elephant, unable, owing to an attack of cataract,
any longer to waUc carefully over a dinner-service for eighteen with a
beer-barrel on his back. By making a sort of offer for this creature,
I succeeded in getting the proprietor to hear enough of my piece to
warrant him in saying he wanted " something new," and though he
just remembered at that moment he had an appointment, he would
like to read it, as he thought he " could do something with it." I
left it with him, and after a good deal of negotiation, and, I am
bound to admit, some little unpleasantness, I had the ultimate
satisfaction of seeing my work " accepted."
There were some alterations and outs, such as all the blank verse
being suppressed, and the characters appearing in succession on
horseback in a "Marvellous Change Feat," while a few seleoted
portions of the comic dialogue were divided between the French Clown
and the Circus-Master, but I believe it went well in the Provinces.
I have, however, never since attempted to " place " anything else. It
is a difficult matter.
From * *.
How did I get a hearing? I will soon tell you. A little experi-
ence—and I quickly learned that nothing could be done without
artifice and force. Seizing my opportunity, I got past the Stage-
door,—I will not mention the Theatre,—and, hiding under the
Manager's table, anxiously awaited his arrival. As soon as he was

principle, twioe over, and was about to begin it a third time, when I

have never got anything listened to or accepted in any other way.
The grand secret is to get past the Stage-door. That done—your
piece is safe. I don't think I can add anything to this.
From * • •.
There are many wavs, I believe, of getting a dramatic work
thankfully and cheerfully accepted by an enterprising and intelli-
gent Entrepreneur: but, to any struggling Author, I can only with
any confidence recommend the simple course I was induced to pursue
myself. Airing myself in the veryhest circles for years, and earning
for myself a reputation at my Club, one of the most exclusive in
Town, as a distinguished Social Lion, I eventually suffered myself
to be introduced to one or two of the most distingue" West-End
Managers. Selecting, after careful study of his character, the most
fitting of these for my purpose, I asked him no less than seventy-
eight successive Sundays to dinner, to meet, " in a quiet, friendly
way," as I put it, a few Peers who happened to be taking pot-luck
with me at the " Star and Garter " at Richmond. After the seventy-
eighth dinner and some Dry Monopole of '65 in magnums, driving
home on a drag with two Dukes on the box, and calling him "Old
Boy," I suddenly sprang my mine by proposing to him that he should
accept my piece—a Farce, the very existence of which I had never
mentioned or even hinted at before. There was no refusing, and the
business was done. I have brought out three farces in this way,
and I have a fourth on the stocks.
From
You ask me how I get my pieces produced. I have always pursued
one plan. When my Play is ready, I look out for any Theatre that
happens to be in the market, and with the financial assistance of a
friend, who happens at the same time to be a patron of the Drama,
I take it. The run is short, but at the end of it we both go througl
the" Bankruptcy Court. I have produced fifteen pieces in this
fashion, and always with the same result. There is no other method.
But with a little spirit, this is infallible.
THE QUESTION SOLVED.
"What shall we do with our boys?" What? Why, make
Directors of them, to be sure. No good? Isn't it! Well, just
read the following advertisement which appears in the Alhenamm:—
DIRECTORS REQUIRED.—To Gentlemen of position and influence,
substantial Fees will be paid.
Mr. Punch has just withdrawn three sons who were marvellously
successful—and costing him five hundred a year a-pieoe—from the
professions of Law, Physic, and Divinity, and is going to forthwith
convert them into Directors. He hopes they will succeed in collaring
the " substantial fees."
Intimidation in Vain.
The theory of the dynamite ringleaders who arrange explosions in
cloak-rooms, railway tunnels, club areas, and public buildings, is
supposed to be that thev hope by those outrages to frighten John
Bull into concession of their demands. Now, John Bull is not to
be frightened by any such scares, and even if he were, it would be
of no use for him to make any such concessions. No concession that
he could possibly make would ever appease the irreconcilable dyna-
miters. Concede whatever he might, they would consider his national
existence a casus belli; unless, indeed, he conceded them a satisfac-
tory subsidy. That is to say, a subsidy exceeding the amount of
revenue they derive from the subscriptions of their dupes.

'ROBERT" AFTER THE DERBY.
Having no perfeshnal engagement for the (Treat Darby day, gents
being all too jolly tired when they gits to Town to think much of
didng out, me and Brown made up our minds to have a reel grand
outing down to Hepsom and back. We had both herd of the
undoutful sort of company as one sumtimes meats on these great
ooasions, so, like sensibel chaps as we is, we fust made our finanshal
calkerlations, and found as we could have all the fun of the fare for
about a pound a peace, and this we changed, and distributed in our
warious pookets in case of accidence. We went fust-class as they
was all alike, but ony single fare, as we might pick up a frend on
the road back. Our cumpany coud scarcely be called mixt, as they
was all much alike, and torked to us quite familiar on our way
down, and kindly made us most temting offers against all the
favourites, but Brown said, as cool as a cowcumber, that our Books
was both made up, and nothink wouldn't induoe us not to open 'em
again. One gent, who looked like a innocent countryman, then
perduoed a pack of oards, and wanted us to try the 3 card trick,
but we both larfed and said, No thanky! wen he got quite cross,
and asked weather we dowted him, to which we replied suttenly not,
no more we did, we hadn't no dout at all about him.
Wen we got on to the Coarse, the wind and the dust was so preshus
cold and blinding, that we took refuse in an harf-crown stand, and
there we could see everythink exoep the horses, for the peepel in
front wood keep there hats on. As we was both determined to go
the hole animal as reel Sporting Oents, we bet upon every one of the
five races, that is, I bet Brown a shilling on each ewent, and, strange
to say, lost 'em all, excep on the dead eat, wen I was so fortnate as
not to lose nuffin. How they could call it a dead eat estonished me,
for one of the two horses was ever so far in front of the other when
they stopt. But, lor, there's no understanding all as you sees on a
raoe-coarse, unless you was born there. For instance now, why
should there he such a bitter prejudice against Welshmen? We saw
a poor fellow being nocked about most shameful, and all beoause he
was a Welshman! As my own lawful Mother was a Welshman, 1
wanted to go to his rescue, but Brown sed I had better not, for the
British Public doesn't like to be hinterfered with in their little harm-
less gratifioashuns.
After the Darby was run, but not wun, we both felt wunderful
hungry, so we rushed off to Carelesses to get sum dinner, and if
that wasn't a site to estonish two hed Waiters/I never seed one yet.
Fancy about 10,000 hungry peeple all wanting dinner at wunce, and
all a wanting it fust. It was a bitter cold day for everybody else,
but dredful hot for the pore Waiters a perspiring at every pore. I
felt harf inclined to off with my best coat and go and elp em, but
Brown said no, we'must^ keep up our character, and so we did, for
we was waitin for nearly a hole our before we got nothink. I never
oomplanes of charges myself, it would not be perfeshonal, but 3». 6d.
for a bit of cold beef and a tator and a pint of bitter, ain't so bad,
Mr. Careless, but'still, it's a long ways to bring 'em, and it's ony
wunce a year, and it was wunderful good of its kind, and 1 was told,
arter I'd gorged myself with beef, that I might have had all the
dellycassies of the season if I'd only a asked for 'em.
Arter the racing was all over we strolled up to the Corner, to see
the fun at crossing the Coarse. And a grand treat it was. Weather
it was the bitter cold weather, or the freezing East Wind, or the
storm of Dust, of course I don't know, but so many werry fresh
young Coaoh Men and old Post Boys I never seed afore, and the
crashing, and the_ smashing, and the screaming, and the swearing,
was somethink quite lovely! How we lookers on did all enjoy it!
It was a good deal past six when we got to the stashun, and if
there wasn't a orowd there, well, I never seed one, that's all. We
learnt that by waiting a little we could get up to Town for Is. 6ef.
each, so we waited. Bow it was ever done I can't think, but while
I was a paying my fair, some one burglariously robbed me of 3«. 6d.
I can't for one moment think as it was the werry frendly person who
so kindly warned me against thimble-riggers and oard-sharkers,
becoz if ever I seed a piotur of simple onesty 1 seed it in him, and he
kep so close to me and took such care of me that he was quite like a
brother-in-law to me.
When we rot to London Bridge, I took stock of my finances, and
found myself with just one shilling left, so I treated myself to a glass
of ale, and took the Bus homewards, and arrived at my!Ebode of
Bliss with just sixpence left. And of all the hundreds of thousands
who wisited Hepsom on that memorerabbble day, I wunder how many
can say, as I can, that he went down fust class, hoccupied a stand,
had a good holesome dinner, lost his money on all the races but won,
had his pocket picked, travelled to town, had more refreshment, and
more travelling, and took home change out of a Sovereign. I quite
bleeve as I can say, "Alone I did it!" Robert

CABINET COUNCIL EXTRAORDINARY.
On Monday last every member of the Administration of a certain
rank received an invitation to meet the Premier at his country
residence. There was a good attendance.
"My dear friends," said the Right Hon. Gentleman, "it occurred
to me, while felling the last few trees that still are to be found in
the neighbourhood of Hawarden, that perhaps, if you had nothing
better to do, you would like to finish the Whitsuntide vacation by
considering the London Government Bill."
"Charmed!" "Delighted!" "Too glad!" was heard on all sides.
The Premier said he was much pleased to see the unusual amount
of unanimity that prevailed among them all, and which he trusted
would continue while discussing the details of this very important,
but, he feared, not very popular measure. There seemed to be a large
amount of opposition to it. Could the Home Secretary explain?
The Home Secretary had not heard of any opposition worth
speaking of. Of course the old Corporation, and the young Board of
Works, and. the Vestries, opposed it; but who cared lor the Vestries,
while they were supported by the whole of the Municipal Reform
League, including his three intimate friends, Messrs. Ayrton, Firth,
and Beal, and all the Democratic Clubs of Chelsea.
The Premier asked how about the Rate-payers?
The Home Secretaey said the fact seemed to be, that because his
grand scheme would probably increase the beggarly rates some fifty
per cent., these poor spiritless fellows were beginning to grumble.
How can you have great change without great expense?
Premier: Well, personally, I don't much care for this sweeping
change; but of course I shall adopt that particular course, out of
the three that ocour to me, that my colleagues prefer. So pray speak
freely.
The Foreign Secretary said that, with the greatest possible
respect for the Home Secretary, and for the result of his Heroulean
labours, he was bound to say that there was a very strong prejudice
against the Bill in the House of Lords, as the abolition of an ancient
and popular Institution that has existed as long as the House of
Lords itself, might possibly be taken as a precedent.
The President of the_ Local Government Board said that per-
haps that might be considered, by philosophical Radicals like him-
self, rather an argument in its favour, but he confessed that he,
personally, detested one huge cast-iron system for the local self-
government of four millions of people, much preferring variety of
administration, which produced a healthy feeling of rivalry, such as
they generally witnessed in their own divided Councils.
The Secretary for War said, of course he had not read a line of
the Monster Bill, as he had heard it called, and he sincerely pitied
any poor devil who was compelled to do so, as it must be an awful
bore, but he had been informed that it contained a good deal of con-
fiscation, and he confessed that, as the heir to a Dukedom with
rather a decent rent-roll, he never heard that awful word without
a shudder.
The President of the Board of Trade said that he did not
share the noble Lord's fears so far as Land was concerned, as the
Laws relating to Land were so infamously bad, that any alteration
must necessarily be an improvement—(" Oh.'")—but his experience
at Birmingham had taught him that one huge Municipality, such as
now proposed, must necessarily be a huge failure for Municipal pur-
poses; of course it would offer a splendid opportunity for establishing
a most magnificent political Caucus.
The Lord Chancellor shared very largely in the fears expressed
by the Secretary for War, for what with this Bill, which confis-
cated the property of the Corporation, and what with the Bill about
to be introduced by the Secretary for the Colonies, for confiscating
the property of the Livery Companies, confiscation would soon be rife
in the City, and it was scarcely likely it would stop there.
The Secretary for the Colonies said that he had no suoh cowardly
fears, since he had demonstrated that a poor Agricultural Labourer
could buy a square yard of freehold land for the price of a pot of beer,
so all that important olass of the community now had to do, was to
give up beer and buy land, and so become, in time, large landed pro-
prietors, and then who would talk of confiscation?
The Home Secretary said that every argument, or what he sup-
posed was intended for argument, used concerning his magnificent
plan, was so thoroughly irrelevant, or so exquisitely absurd, that he
would not waste either their or his own time in demolishing them,
further than saying, in the kindest and most conciliatory manner,
that if his Bill were as great a muddle as their Egyptian Policy, as
insulting as their Shipping Bill, as silly as their depreciation of the
Coinage, or as cowardly as their treatment of Gordon, he would
withdraw it at once!
The Council broke up in great disorder.

OUR INSANE-ITARY GUIDE TO THE HEALTH
EXHIBITION.
Part I.—The South Gallery.
Before commencing a handbook, which I hope may be of as much
real service to the healthiest subject as the greatest invalid, it will
be as well to point out the best way of reaching the Institution to
which it is hoped it will prove a faithful guide. To the truly
economical, walking to^ South Kensington can be confidently re-
commended. Exercise is the ,very essence of health, and a stroll,
say from Gravesend to Brompton, should bring the roses into the
palest cheeks. To those who are willing to experiment upon their
bodies in the cause of Science, the Underground Railway goffers
unusual advantages. A journey from; Moorgate Street to the
Gloucester Road, on a nice hot day, when an ample supply of sul-
phur can be obtained in the tunnels close to Portland Place, is
calculated to render the heartiest of passengers capable of improve-
ment from a sanitary point of view. The omnibuses remain to those
who are fond of working out that painfullest of problems—how to
compress the maximum of matter into the minimum of space.
But say that the Health-seeker has arrived pretty safe and fairly
sound at the Main Entranoe of the International. He will have
already passed some scores of itinerant vendors of sanitary wares in
the shapes of cork mice, tin mechanical alligators, and penny china
dolls, who will have prepared him for the many hygienic articles he
will find within the walls. Thus, he will not be surprised to dis-
cover that photographs are essential to a healthy body. The first
stall is devoted more or less to pictures of Mr. Henry Irving, the
Premier, Miss Ellen Terry, Sir Cunliffe Owen, and the heroine
of the Garmoyle Breach of Promise Case. No doubt this galaxy of
beauty is intended to please the eye already dilating with wonder at
an equestrian statue of the Prince of Wales, produced to colossal
dimensions, which boldly challenges, nay, defies critioism, in the
Entranoe Hall. Having derived Denefit from this first exhibit, he
turns round, and faces a newspaper-stall, and calms his nerves by
purchasing an evening journal, which conveys to him the pleasing
intelligence that he has been half ruined by the sudden and unex-
pected collapse of some favourite security, in whioh are invested the
savings of nine-tenths of a lifetime. Thus prepared, he inspects—
"Class I. Selected Displays of Unprepared Animal and Vegetable
Substances used as Food in various Countries." Noticing that the
specimens of this' Division, which, according to the Catalogue, are
devoted to "Health," are not confined to his native land, he
regards that admirable food, "stuffed heads of Bison, Antelope,
and Deer " (2) without astonishment, thinking, no doubt, that the
delicacy is thoroughly enjoyed by the inhabitants of tne North
Pole, or perhaps the Equator. He next turns his attention to some
olever theatrical "properties," which at first sight he imagines
must have been supplied by Mr. Augustus Harris as a reminis-
cence of a " rally " in the oomio part of the last Drury Lane Panto-
mime (Cases 10 and 8), but which turn out to be contributions from
Messrs. Webb and Sons, and the Family Sutton. He is admiring
these huge presentments of Vegetables, when a large painting on the
wall, somewhat resembling the gigantio canvasses that once were
wont to adorn the outsides of booths at a country-fair, attracts his
attention. The picture represents a fat ox labelled with the prices to
be charged for his joints and limbs. Adding up the various sums to
be charged—1^1. for a leg, and so on—he finds that a whole ox can
be secured for about eleven shillings! Passing the realms devoted to
"cuttings from the joint," he comes to " Class II.," which consists
of "Prepared Vegetables used as Food, including Tinned, Com-
pressed, and Preserved Fruits and Vegetables, Bread, Butter, and
Biscuits of all kinds, and Tobacco." Here he can gloat for a good
ten minutes upon all sorts of good things, from the simple acidulated
drop up to the loftiest types of the idealised lollipop. On his left,
noble specimens of wedding-cakes suggest that, alter all, something
may be said in favour of matrimony; while, on his right, he finds all
sorts and conditions of biscuits. And here he is attracted to a little
crowd of spectators, who seem to be hanging on the words of a
gentleman who appears to be addressing them in a tone of the most
fervid eloquenoe. The Health-seeker approaches the group, and
catches a phrase now and then to the effect that something or
other is " most digestible," and that " one hundred go to the pound."
The attentive auditors follow with their glistening eyes the nand of
this gentleman, which holds a plate. After a long harangue, the
speaker distributes morsels of biscuit amongst his listeners, who
thereupon immediately hurry away I
_ By this time the Health-seeker is ravenous. Still, as he has no
right to test the culinary capabilities of the Exhibition at so early
a period of his initial visit, he should take steps to assuage his
hunger by some mode other than by consuming food. Fortunately,
the means are at hand. All he has to do is to put his head into " 89,
Vegetalarian Society." and regard the dinners being served to the
revellers, and he will find a sensible diminution in his appetite. Coming
to ClassIV." the Health-seeker is provided with "beverages of all
kinds—(a) Alcoholic, (b) Non-alcoholio, (c) Infusions (tea, coffee,
cocoa, chocolate, &c.)." Naturally he will not take any particular inter-
est in the last section of this Class. As for the aerated waters, he will
Eresume that they are one and all better than each other, and, if he
elieves their respective proprietors, he will be right. However, he
will be much struck with one alcove which serves as the haunt of a
Lady and some soda-water bottles. The Lady and her sparkling
attendants rest under a shield bearing the simple but satisfactory
legend "Purity." _ Leaving the dairies and their occupants for
another visit, and disregarding the seductive charms of non-alcoholic
beverages such as Aromatic Ginger Ale (135), Speciality Lime Juice
(136), and the Original Sparkling Tonic Hedozone (138), he should
turn his serious attention to the alcoholic drinks. He can scarcely
do better than take the following doses in the cause of health, whioh
may be aptly oalled—
Liquor Programme for a Confirmed Invalid.
[Compiled from the Sanitary Exhibits at South Kensington.)
1. A glass of Ind, Coope & Co.'s ale and stout mixed (123) to
begin with.
2. A half-bottle of Lima et Flls ohampagne (128) just to get the
palate into proper order.
3. A goblet of the pure wine of Amontillado (145) to appreciate its
nutty quality.
4. Two or three specimens of the Euoalyptus Preparations by the
Trappist Friars at the Tre Fontane, near Rome (147), as an experir
ment.
5. A pint of Peregiaux et Cie. Champagne, " Grand Tin de
Cabinet, extra quality (151), a most admirable thirst-quencher.
6. And, to top up with—a bottle of "Original Plymouth Gin"
(156).
Having oonsumed these excellent products of the Health Exhibition
of 1881, the Invalid will be quite in a fit condition—" to go home to
tea!"
Useful Note to the Visitor.—Wherever you see anything eatable
being made,—say confectionery or cakes, or butter, or bread, and so
forth, you have only to stand opposite the man who is making it,
whatever it it, and stare at Aim, with your mouth open, and, if you
only remain there long enough, you are sure to get a taste of it, or
perhaps get it all. The man can't help it, he becomes quite mesmer-
ised, and is forced to pop whatever edible he iB concocting into your
mouth. This is worth knowing, and has, perhaps, something to do
with thought-reading.
THE WHITSUNTIDE RECESS.
(By a Town Mouse.)
Friends asked me out of Town; they said the woodlands looked so
fair,
And there was nothing half so good as healthful country air;
I weakly yielded—hard it is when folks politely press—
Oh, would that I had never known this Whitsuntide Recess!
I went into the Country, there the woods were green, no doubt,
But still a nasty nipping wind blew keenly in and out;
And what's the charm of leafy aisles, and Summer clouds of green,
With North-East winds to aggravate your liver and your spleen.
It was an old baronial hall at which I went to stay,
The sort of place that's full of draughts in quite the ancient way:
I felt inclined to wear my furs when up the stairs I'd tread,
With cyclones from each corridor careering round my head.
And then the garden full of flowers, and hay-scent on the breeze,
That brought just as a pleasant change the snuffle and the sneeze;
The while I read Mackenzie's page, and all the good it brings
Is nothing cures hay-fever like avoidance of such things.
We visited the village near, but nobody explained,
The pioturesque abodes we saw were not too deeply drained;
The rivulet that rolled hard by looked ominously brown;
I thought, "I '11 see what Jenner says when I get back to Town."
Then home I fled, and talk no more of oountry life in June—
Give me the snug Club window through eaoh changeful afternoon:
To long for more than London gives is imbecile and silly;
There s not a spot upon the earth so fair as Piccadilly.
The Fortnightly has a fine musioal organ, and has developed a
capacity for vocalisation. There is no doubt about the tone of its
"G " this month. At first there was some uncertainty as to whether
it was the " Upper G " or not. One thing is certain, that" G " is not
the initial letter of " Jingo."

NOTHING 1IF NOT PEACTICAL;
OB, what, no doubt, it will come to.
In the great reading-room of the British Museum, which was again
yesterday afternoon, as on a previous occasion, forcibly seized for the
purpose, Mr. Nobthumbebland Dean gave some further illustra-
tions of the process now generally known as Happy Thought reading.
It will be remembered that, some years since, two gentlemen fore-
shadowed, but only by some trivial and fruitless experiments, the
great development that has taken place in the manifestation of this
useful power to-day. The area in front of the Museum, as indeed
every nook and cranny of the vast interior, was crowded with a
surging and seething mass of the representatives of law, literature,
science, calisthenics, art, wire-pulling, medicine, tight-rope dancing,
steeple-chasing, and other kindred callings interested in the new
discovery.
At the request of Mr. Nohthumbebland Dean, a Committee of
Management was soon formed. The Lord Chief Justice of England,
Messrs. Cbosse and Blackwell, the Proprietor of the Canterbury
Hall, the Archbishop of Yobk, the Beadle of the Lowther Arcade,
and several other distinguished personages, who, having never seen
or heard of the performer before, were above all suspicion of collu-
sion, politely but eagerly volunteered for the office. Mr. Nobthum-
bebland Dean, having briefly explained that his system, which was
conducted entirely by the sinews, the larger bones, and the aid of a vein
or two, could only succeed when there was some practical purpose to
serve, the first experiment, the hiding of a red-hot poker among a
pile of mediseval manuscripts, was tried to the entire satisfaction of
all present,—though Professor Colvin, who happened to come in at
the moment, and nad not helped to place the article himself, was a
little sceptical on the subject. He was, however, speedily, but good-
humouredly, howled down. Some of the next essays were similar to
those attempted on the previous day, though one of the subjects
proved impracticable. The experimentalist having requested that
Borne one might be selected to go out into Little George Street and
fell the first policeman he met with a coal-hammer, and the ohoice of
the Committee falling on the Lord Chief Justice, he showed no sign
of moving, and the matter came to a standstill. The medium being
unable therefore to detect the crime, the commission of which was thus
"unsympathetically" frustrated, a similar result followed with a
Royal Duke, who declined to get into a Bayswater omnibus and leave
it without paying after stealing a fellow passenger's umbrella. The
refusals led to 6ome protest on the part of the principal, who
remarked hotly once or twice, waving his arms about as if in deep
grief, "If these gentlemen go against me in this fashion, I cannot
possibly do it. I have no effect on stones." A third trial was how-
ever made, and with marked success. The Proprietor of a Travelling
Circus, who subsequently requested his name might be suppressed,
proved more "sympathetic" For relieving one of the Committee
suddenly of his watch, purse, and handkerchief, without any warn-
ing, he was quickly detected by the experimenter, and given into
custody on the spot, amidst the vociferous cheers of the audience.
But now came the chief experiment of the day. The trial which
excited the greatest interest, though in its ultimate results not so
satisfactory as many of the others, was the disoovery of half-a-
hundredweight of dynamite within a radius of five miles of the
Museum. It was agreed that the Lobd Chancellob, being a good
subject, should secrete the explosive. Professor Holdebness and a
well-known Conservative Member of Parliament accompanying him,
rather reluctantly, as witnesses. On their return, which occasioned
some surprise and a good deal of merriment, a coal-sack was put
over the head of Mr. Nobtiiumbebland Dean, and he was forthwith
attached to the Lobd Chancellob—who, to lend eclat and respecta-
bility to this curious manifestation^ kindlv consented to put on his
official robes—by a hundred and titty yards of one-inch steel-rope.
With a sudden and almost frightening rapidity of movement, that
at first several times repeatedly pulled the Lobd Chancellob off his
legs, the experimenter made a dash straight in the direction of New
Oxford Street, followed by the whole of the scientific assemblage,
yelling with delight, and in his course catching the legs and tripping
up the casual wayfarers, who seemed too astonished at the novel
proceeding to call a policeman to their assistance.
But now the most exciting part of the proceedings had arrived:
for, tearing down Regent Street in the direction of the House of
Commons, the entangling coils of the steel-rope, seriously at

[A Troubled Dream of the Future.)
times interfering with the omnibus and cab traffic, and causing some
ugly, though not uuamusing accidents at sudden turns and corners,
Mr. Northumberland Dean dragged after him the now perspiring
Chancellor more furiously than ever. The scene down Parliament
Street, owing to the presence of a strong force of mounted police, called
out by the Authorities for the purpose of keeping the uproarious spirits
of the Representative Committee somewhat in check, was quite
remarkable._ A brisk discussion, too, arose opposite the Treasury,
at which point several Members of the Government, returning from a
Cabinet Council, were inadvertently caught in the steel-rope, and
hurried along, helplessly protesting, and with the loss of their hats,
in the direction of Palace Yard.
At this moment, a tremendous explosion, which appeared to come
from the House itself, arrested the'progress of the party; Mr. North-
umberland Dean simultaneously removing the coal-sack from his
head, and saying that he feared something had gone wrong with
the conditions, inquired of the Lord Chancellor where he had
deposited the object to be concealed. The prompt reply, " Under
the Woolsack," was the signal for a shout of laughter; but when it
transpired, as it subsequently did, by the immediate rush of eight-
and-twenty fire-engines, that, owing to the carelessness of an Official,
the dynamite had gone olf rather earlier than was expected, there
were some signs of disappointment. The Horse Guards having now
turned out, and cleared the street as far as Charing Cross with the
fiat side of their sabres, Mr. Northumberland Dean acknowledged
that, with some persons, it was absolutely impossible to divine their
thoughts or their motives.
As a last experiment, to illustrate the detection of crime, the
Chairman of the North-Eastern Banking Company was held, against
his will, under water in one of the fountains by several members of
the Representative Committee, but the experimenter, who expressed
himself as much overstrung and fatigued, declined either to look for
him, or even to assist in pulling him out.
The proceedings then terminated.

LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business.
On " Called Back" at the Prince's.
Dear Kendal,
Love to Hare—I should say Falrs—but as your senior
partner is just now free to go about and see everything, I don't write
to him. You have to stav at the theatre, and do the "Ironmon-
gering " business, which, 1 hear, is producing eminently satisfactory
results. My compliments to your, talented wife, on her admirabl*
impersonation of real presence of mind, when those dastardly Dyna-
mitards caused such a shock in vour neighbourhood. However,
vour good lady," as the oivil
old-fashioned shopkeepers term
one's wife—a phrase I personally
resent, as suggestive of bigamy,
or of what, in the very upperest-
crustiest circles, is ca lied a
"Morganatio Marriage," because
the next question, after asking
after "your good lady," would
naturally be to inquire after
"your bad lady,"—well, as I was
about to observe, your excellent
Lady is so accustomed to " bring-
ing down a house" that there is
less merit in her having retained
her tang froid, on the occasion of
the explosion, nearly a fortnight
ago.
So much for that. And now
to tell you about Called Back,
at the Prince's, written by the
Tramway Car Co.—meaning, of
course, Messrs. Comyns Carr
and Hugh Conway, who have
dramatised the latter's well-known
Christmas story. (By the way,
read his Bound Together, in two
vols. Capital book with a cigar:
it will wake you up, if drowsy.) I
didn't believe a Play could be made
out of the novel; Dut it has been
done. Next I didn't believe that a good Play could be made out of
the novel; and this hasn't been done. As your partner John Hare
would say, with all the fun of the Fairs, "It may be Called Back or
Called a Tale, but it can't be called a really good Play."
And, mind you, Johx Hare would be, as I need, hardly say he
always is, correct. Those who

the book will
Play, just to
have read
to see the
how it is done," and those who
haven't read the book will see
the Play and then order the
novel,—bo it's good for the
bookseller anyhow; but neither
the first nor second division of
the above-mentioned Playgoers
will, I fancy, pay it a second
visit, because there is nothing
whatever to attract them either
in the acting or in the mise-en-
tcrne. Between ourselves, I
don't think much of your Iron-
monger as a Play. It was
better left as the Maitre de
Forget. But there is acting in
that whioh people would go
twice to Bee,—need I say to
whose acting I allude? No, 1
need not. So, don't blush as
you read this.
Now, though Called Back
is undoubtedly a hit with the
publio at present, yet unfor-
tunately for it as a lasting
success, its most powerful Act
is the Prologue, which, though it will not bear critical examination,
is thoroughly dramatic, and so whets the appetite for sensation-
alism that the audience, like Oliver, "asks for more," and, also
like Oliver, doetn't get it. With the Prologue the interest virtually
ceases, and it says much for Mr. Comtns Carr's dramatic craftiness
and for Mr. Beerbohm-Tree's ability, that Author and Actor are
able to detain a far from enthusiastic audience in their seats, up to
the fall of the Curtain on the final situation in the last Act, for the
Lingard t s Donna Elvira
Don Giovanni," — without
from
the
sole purpose of seeing what becomes of Paolo Macari, and whether
he is killed by a determined little conspirator of the name of Petroff,
who goes about like a Guy Fawkes out of work, in a very bad hat,
and with a long carving-knife gleaming from out of the folds of a
regular decrochez-moi-ca conspirator's cloak.
If little Peter Petroff's character were only half as bad as his hat
poor Paolo Beerbohm Macari wouldn't stand a chance. But—will
you believe it ?—Petroff doesn't kill Macari. No!—the audience has
waited for this to be done—it is all they ask, it is all they want, and
then they will go home satisfied to bed,—but no!—Peter Petroff only
glides in from behind a pillar,—he has been visible to every one
except poor Beerbohm Macari for about half an hour before, or at
least his shadow has, on the tops of the trees (somehow) in the garden
below,—and slowly producing his inconvenient carving-knife, he
utters in a sepulchral tone some strange word sounding like
"Walk-ar!" wh ich makes poor Paolo shrink and stagger, and then
—down goes'the Curtain, and that's all.
The audience, certain that this can't be the finish, or, if so,
"they'll know the reason why," applauds, for the sake of getting
the Curtain up again,—when they expect to see the Stage cleared of
such encumbrances as the Ladies must be on such an occasion, and
to hear Paolo's death-cry, as he sinks on the ground, while little
Peter Petroff shall be seen wiping his knife on the old Guy Fawkes
hat, as he once more mutters the awful word "Walk-ar !" and turns
on his heel. That is the sort of Tableau that you and John Hare (even

Ceneri Troupe before a very select audience. Evening parties attended.
The subject is " March Past—a Beview."
without our dear old Sir Anthont Pinero) would have arranged at
the St. James's, eh? But Messrs. Comyns Carr and Conway and
Bruce, and the whole lot of 'em, have missed the tip (whioh, if you
show them this letter, they wiU now seize with avidity) and, even
when the Curtain rises again, that stupid little Petroff is as far off as
ever from killing Beerbohm Macari, who is shrinking and squirming
with all his might and main, there being nothing else for him to do
except bolt, and Comyns Carr and Conway won t let him do that.
At that supreme moment no one wants to see Mr. Kyrle Bellew,
Miss Linoard, Mr. Lethcourt, and Miss Tilbury. As long as the
Ladies are present, little Petroff, who, though a bloodthirsty con-
spirator, is evidently innately polite, is completely paralysed. As
long as those Ladies stay there, Macari is safe. In fact, he would
be all right, if, taking advantage of their presence, he were to bolt by
the side-door, locking it after him, or if he jumped down into the
garden; as the chances would be against PeUr Petroff making any-
thing of a shot at him with his carving-knife from a great distance,
unless he happened to be well up in the Japanese dagger-throwing
trick, of which proficiency, however, no mention has been made in
any earlier part of the piece.
So much for the finish, whioh is nearly as weak as the commence-
ment is strong. There is plenty of comic relief in the piece, however,
in the Second Act, when Mr. Kyrle Bellew calls on Mr. Anson, who,
as Dr. Ceneri, has been sent to prison in Siberia. Of this place Messrs.
Carr and Conway have evidently made a close study,—it would have
resulted in a closer study had they been caught. They probably
adopted Mr. Bancroft's admirable plan of going to the place where
the scene of your piece is laid, and bringing back with you the local
colour. Mr. Bancroft, to produce The Rivalt, went to Bath:
Messrs. Carr, Conway, and Bruce went of course to Siberia, and
brought back a fortress and prisoners, a Prisoner's Comic Song and
Chorus, some old shoes, warm coats, and plenty of "padding" for an
entire Act.

Jumc H, 1884.] PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The pantomime business in this scene reflects the greatest credit on
all concerned. Mr. Anson is admirable, and the way in which he
won't tell anything, and has spasms and something to drink, and
then more spasms, and then more something-to-drink, and so contrives
to eke out the Act, until he dies with the secret of the fifth Act still
about him, is highly praiseworthy.
But you ask me what is the interest of the piece P Well, there
it is; that's just it. After the First Aot, hardly any. A blind man
recovers his sight, a girl goes crazy only to get all right again, and
Mr. Bellew travels from Hampstead to Siberia, via Soho, to learn
something from Dr. Ceneri, whom he has no more reason to believe
than he has Macari or Petroff, or any of the lot; and as he was far
more likely to have trusted Miss Pauline March, he had better have
waited for her recovery,—for he couldn't marry her as long as she
was a lunatic, unless he had lost his own senses just to keep her
company,—or made use of the supernatural thought-reading which
is useful in its plaoe in the book, but is absolutely valueless except
for exhibiting a sort of tableau vitant of the talented Anson Ceneri
troupe, in their clever drawing-room entertainment, entitled Mad as
a March Hare—all in one Scene, with no one except Pauline and
Macari as audience to guess it!
Have you seen Mr. Kykle Bellew lately? No P Well, then you
would be delighted with him. So would partner Hake. Do you
remember Charles Kean?
r Just. Good: then I never
saw anybody more like
Charles Kean as Louis dei
Franchi than Mr. Ktble
Bellew in evening dress, in
the Second Act of Called
Backx that is, as long as he is
standing still; but the instant
he moves, he is Henet Ibvino
compressed. Yet—what can
you want more? two single
Tragedians rolled into one,
i.e., the late Chaeles Kean
and the present Henbt
Irving all in one pocket-
companion Artist! Then his
impersonation of blindness!
my! that will thrill you! If
it be true that " none are so
blind as those who won't
see," you can just imagine
how hopelessly stark staringly
blind is Mr. Ktble Bellew.
I think your Mr. Henley
could do all the Irving busi-
ness just as well, but not the
Charles Kean department.
Mr. Beebbohm-Tbee's is
a remarkable performance as
the Italian Squirmer, Paolo
Macari. He is an instance
of how one may "smile and
smile, and be a villain,"—only he couldn't be a villain unless
he did smile and smile. He gets on in life, and is an example of
"Self-Help by Smiles"; and he is more and more squirmingly
villainous every time I see him. Authors, when you 're writing a
part for this gentleman, "spare that Tbee," and don't give nim
another foreign villain to play. But that Dr. Anson Ceneri and
the other conspirators are the simplest creatures possible, Beer-
bohm Macari would have had no sort of chance of being trusted as a
brother-conspirator, though he might have very easily got an engage-
ment as one of the Girard Troupe, and have gone round the country
in his celebrated "Corkscrew Contortionist Act" most successfully.
Au revoir! Strike while the Ironmonger's hot, but hear,—from Nlbbs.

be an acquisition to the trying-on room of a boot-shop. She might
be seized with a desire to play the concertina or thump the tam-

A CHAT WITH THE KING OE THE MAORIES;
OK, HOW THEY INTERVIEW NOWADAYS.
Immediately on hearing that Taleawayo, the Maori King, was
coming to this country, we sent off—as we usually do—a Member of
our Staff to have a quiet conversation with him. The result of the
interview, as far as we can gather from incoherent sentences dropped
by our Correspondent, is as follows; but as he is at present in the
Plymouth Hospital, and is only at intervals conscious, it is difficult to
extract a connected narrative out of him. If he ever gets well again,
he intends to prosecute King Taleawayo for trying to eat him!
APPEABANCE Of THE KlNO.
Taleawayo is a singularly athletic monarch. His agility in jump-
ing on a prostrate adversary and his development of biceps are, I
should imagine from recent experience, quite extraordinary. When
I entered his cabin the New Zealand King was lying on a sofa, and I
had the opportunity of observing the singularly mild and benevolent
aspect of his countenance. When much excited, the tattoo-marks all
over his face become absolutely livid. The sole remnant of barbario
display that I noticed about him was an overcoat made of dried
scalps stitched together, and fastened on the breast by a couple of
bones, which the King sometimes detaches when he desires to prac-
tise a new tune on his favourite musical instruments. He carries a
rather thick club ornamented with sharks' teeth, which at an early
moment of our interview I managed to hide in a convenient corner
under pretence of admiring it, and I attribute my subsequent escape
from sudden death entirely to this innocent stratagem.
What he has come to England fob.
"What is your object in visiting our shores?" I asked.him, in my
choicest New Zealand patois.
The Native Interpreter here interposed somewhat nervously, and
told me I had better not pursue that line of interrogation. He had
known Taleawayo skin people alive for calling him an "object." I
hastened to assure the Interpreter that he had misunderstood me,
and continued pleasantly—
"Do you expect to have a satisfactory interview with the
Authorities at the Colonial Office f"
I was gratified to find that the King understood this question, as
he smacked his lips, and said something about "liking them boiled
best."
"Ha, ha! A good joke!" I replied, thinking it as well to humour
him; "but you mustn't let people mistake you for the King of the
Cannibal Islands, you know, I added, thinking that a harmless jest
might tickle his Royal fancy.
The next moment I regretted my imprudence! Seizing me by the
hair of my head But the Editor requests me to draw a veil over
the ensuing scene, so I will merely remark that I am convinced
Taleawayo would have lunched on me raw if I had not been rescued
by the combined efforts of the Steward, the Bo'sun's Mate, and the
Cabin-Boy.
Taleawayo's Retinue.
After having brandy and other restoratives administered to me in
the State Cabin, I managed to crawl on deck. There I found the
Chiefs who had accompanied the King to England. Their names, as
pronounced to me by the Cabin-Boy, are Topia Copia, Hubbi Upa-
cupa, Pattera Teacaei. and Hi Tallyhoawoa, all of them, sol
was assured, being household words in New Zealand.
"How do you like England as far as you've got?" I asked of one
of these noble savages.
His reply, couched in the vigorous vernacular, is difficult to repro-
duce in English, but is practically equivalent to "Find out!" I
may mention that I experienced at once a friendly feeling towards
Pattera Teacaei, as he had been the Editor of the New Zealand
newspaper, Hookeyoi. He told me, however, that he had given up
journahstio pursuits sinoe his type had been smashed and most of
his compositors scalped by the Editor of a rival paper called the
Walkeroi.
How the Interview Ended.
I could not, as you will see, gather from this remarkably taciturn
band their object in visiting England, but the Cabin-Boy informed
me that it was connected with an error in the number of kegs of
whiskey which had been given the monarch fifteen years ago by the
"New Zealand Nigger Expropriation Company" for the whole of his
territory in fee simple.
Sinoe that time Taleawayo and suite have all taken the Blue
Ribbon. Intending to make myself pleasant to poor old Teacaei, I
asked him in a jocular manner, "whose Blue Ribbon it was that he
took." It must have been my pronunciation of the Maori language
which, irritated him ■ for before 1 knew where I was, I found myself,
by an inoredibly adroit movement of Teacaki's foot, hoisted over
the side of the vessel. Since then I have felt both morally and
unable to gather any more information about the Maori
and his companions.

[By a Wits-untied Holiday-Maker.)
What a mad time for a holiday is just past! The very name is
suggestive of lunacy—" The Wits-untied Holidays!" As the poet,
no matter what poet, sings—
Be Christmas, Easter, Midsummer enjy'd
But give us still our madcap Wits-untied!
And so naturally off I went. Where to? Where is there so much
change to be obtained (and parted with) in a short time as in Paris?
That s the place. An easy stage, per London, Chatham and Dover,
at 10 a.m. from Victoria, with forty minutes of first-rate buffet at
Calais, and then arrive in Paris at 8 p.m. By nine you are ready to
saunter out of the Grand Hotel, and to give to the Parisians a treat
on the Boulevards. If a fine and warm night, and all the world
merry-making, as tout le monde must be at the Wits-untied season,
you will take a voiture, drive to the Elysian Fields, and dine there
al fresco. If wet, you will go to your favourite Restaurant and
restore yourself.
Notes En Voyage.—If you want to thoroughly enjoy a holiday,
always take work with you, and—don't do it. No matter what work
it be—acoounts to make up, letters to answer, studies, literature,
sketches to make, take all the materials with you, and unpack them if
you like; look at them every morning if you like; but—use them? No.
En Voyage.—In a private cabin. Here I retire, in case the stormy
winds should blo-o-ow. Here I lie, full length, and wonder whether...
or if ... ah! well, it may not be so bad, after all. But what mockery
when I am in this state to read this notice:—" Messieurs les
Voyageurs sont tres instamment priis de NE POINT FUMER
dans les cabines." Ne point fumer! and printed in capitals, too!
Fumer! I'd as soon think of asking for boiled pork and a
raspberry-jam omelette. The idea of "smoking" here .... and

The different ways visitors have of _ entering a salle u manger are
well worth noting. Some come in as if qnite surprised to see any-
body there. Some always appear to 'be looking for a friend, and
others enter frowning and grasping' a walking-stiok as if they were
trying to find someone who had insulted them, or were prepared to
lay violent hands on a seat, turn anybody out, and have a, row there
and then. Some come in timidly; some come in curiously; some
disdainfully, these generally are elegantly-dressed Ladies with pince-
nez, who survey the company as if to see whether it's good enough
for them, as, if not, they '11 demand their five francs back again.
Some come in merrily, chattering all the time,—these are French
people out for a holiday; some come in heavily, but all come in
hungrily.
I like Manager Blum's Babel Hotel. You enter as an individual,
and suddenly—you become a number! Yes, a number, or rather,
numbered, like a convict, or a song in a Music-hall programme, as it
used to be in the good old days of Evans's. You are, for example,

rare humour,
as in the
"Polichinelle
ohm,"—he is very fond of Folichinelles,—" Le Vin du Cure,"
and, among others, the young fellow reading an important letter
to his intimate friend, and asking his advice. This last,—I
cannot recall the title at the moment,—is admirable in every way.
Of course, no one visiting Paris will fail to assist in celebrating "Us
Noces d' Or de V Artiste avec son Pinceau,"—and the golden results
are for the benefit of the Night Refuges of Paris.

Real Art: Two Amateurs (or Amatores) deeply interested
in examining a Meissonier.
Went to see Le Depute de Bombignac at the Francais. New
pieoe in three Acts, with two first-rate parts for the two Coqueijns;
the other dramatis persona being mere "supporters," or "feeders."
It is founded on the same idea as Le Mart a la Campagne, but is
nothing like so good. Who is responsible for the Stage Management
of this new piece at the Francais? The chairs and tables are placed
across the stage in a straight line; the Actors get as often as ever
they possibly can into a row, as if they were saying a lesson,
their only Stage business apparently being to get out of it again.
The poses are theatrical, and overdone. Les deux Coquelins are
excellent, but the art in the piece is too apparent, and you never for
one moment are allowed to forget that the Actors are merely acting.
I haven't retained the bill nor the names, but the exception to this rule
was the Actor who played a Country Gentleman, and he seemed to
me to be particularly good. The piece is unnecessarily spun out:
much dialogue, little action, and situations not strikingly original or
very strong. To make an international epigrammatic pun, the piece
struck me as all Coquelin and "No Got.'
Trois Femmes pour un Mari, at the Cluny, is immensely funny.
This out-of-the-way theatre,—where Le Juif Polonais was originally
produced, which, being translated into The Bells, led Colonel Bate-
man to discover Irving as Mat huts—was crowded even on one of the
most sweltering nights that just preceded the Wits-untied holiday.
Well worth a visit.
Whitsunday. Paris is very, very full. There is just room enough
for me. One more person, and Paris would be overcrowded. As to
pace, either on the roads or along the streets, that is impossible. You
can crawl or drive, very leisurely, or you can "sit out," with or
without a partner; but walking, by way of exercise, is impracticable.
Besides it s a holiday, and who wants exercise?
Philological Note.—When the English traveller can, in ordinary
conversation with the natives, put dis done, tiens, tenez, alors, bon,
parfaitement, d la bonne heure, and just a few other words, in their
right places and quite naturally, then he may begin to consider that
he is in a fair way to acquire some real knowledge of the French
language.
At the Sign of the Golden Lion.—A wonderful place is M. Reig-
sard's hostelrie "Au Lyon d'Or," the Restoration of a Restauration
of the Renaissanoe period, occupying the site of the Hotel du Holder
—and something more, but as 1 only saw it at night, and, it being
rainy, got inside as quickly as possible, I am unable to say, from
one visit, whether the Lyon d'Or includes my old friend the Helder,
or whether the Helder includes the Lion. At all events the latter
is the more modern, and the former remains the H-elder institution.
Everything in the Lyon d'Or is of the Renaissance time—except
the food, which is of the latest and best style, and the drink, which is,
some of it, of the oldest or the best vintage. Decidedly Vive Pommery
of '74! The decanters are of Mediteval pattern, but there has been
no trifling with the Champagne bottles, which are of the usual make.
A Lafitte first, or a good Pontet-Canet with age on it, and then ask
mine host of the Lyon d'Or to give you his Pommery, and not too
cold, no matter how warm the weather may be. As good a dinner as
you '11 get in Paris, and perfectly served, is to be obtained at the Lyon
d'Or. I don't say the Lion is a cheap animal. No: to perpetrate
an international jeu de mot, I should say "The Lion's cher." To
drop into poetry—
You '11 spend some hundred franca and more,
On dinner for three at the " Lyon d'Or."
But it is worth it—even without the tapestry and the Renaissance
?lass and flagons, and queer-shaped knives. I regret that I have
not the details of that simple repast by me,—for 1 left the bill behind
me,—which suggests another song, " The Bill I left behind me!"
—but it was paid. The Ballads of the Restaurants have yet to be
written. But when? After the dinners, or before them?
Avis aux Voyageurs.—When in doubt, dine at the Lyon d'Or. As
a rule, order beforehand; this will apply equally to the Cafe Anglais,
Ledoyen's, or the Cafe des Ambassadeurs. At this latter place, if the
weather be as hot as it was just a fortnight ago, select a corner of
the terrasse facing the stage where the sweet singers and dancers
afterwards appear, and you will have plenty of amusement for your
money,—and all in the open air. What simple, primitive tastes!
My excellent countrymen, ay, and—ahem! my countrywomen, too.
who at home decry the Music-hall entertainments and Music-hall
songs, here revel in this sort of thing, and go into ecstasies over the
tom-fooleries of the men in women's dresses, and roar with laughter
at the vastly witty songs which, I venture to say, not one English-
man in twenty rightly understands.
M. Paulus is chez lui here, and far better than he was at the
Empire Theatre in Leicester Square. Tiens! what an audience!
Crowded, snouting, applauding, and joining in the choruses! but
then it was a fete day, and a considerable number of them had been
to the races; and altogether I should say that His Grace of Canter-
bury and Lord Shaftesbury would have been highly delighted with
this happy termination to the well-spent Sunday that commenced
the festival of Our Wits-untied Holidays.

Frock, such as you described." [Gives Engraver's Name and Address.
THE GRAND PRIZE A L'ANGLAISE.
From Our Rfdacteur Hippique.—A rAnglaise is the way to do it, and "Down
with VAnglais!" is the cry to take up. Contradictory, hut Gallic. Logic is
our great gift: that's why it has always been a logic of our own. A VAnglaise
—bien! and I hire my mail-cart, painted red, to be dans le mouvement, and not
tricolor, as too ardent patriots like M. DSrouxede suggested. Wound a green
veil round my white hat, and put some lobster-claws in my pocket, in case I
should meet an Englishman who might tell me what to do with them.
Sur la Road.—The worst of it is that it isn't long enough. And we do it every
day. We must get that horrid Radical Municipal Council to give us some Ups
and Downs for the Grand Prize. There are no Grand Prizes without Epsome
Ups and Downs. It is a dangerous pinnacle the boxing-seat of a mail-cart, and
I find it difficult to acquire an accurate idea of the odds and evens on Little Duck
while holding on with both hands. The green veil makes my lady friends,
Lolotte (of the Insanites), and Popotte (of the Insipidites), imagine I am
becoming stone-blind—though why " stone," unless it has something to do with
rolling—rolling stone, rolling eye, you know—-je n'en sais rien. Is it d VAnglaise
to wear one's veil down P
On the Course.—Grand Stand Something to drink—which seems to be the
correct description, so far as I can gather from the conversation of the English-
men about. Where are the Bookmakers?—awfully low people with lots of
money, but they don't make books. There's a Milord next me who has made a
book, but he doesn't look like a person who would cry out, " Voyez la cote!
voyez la cote!" and take your five francs on Leetle Dock, and be half-way to
Paris when you come back for your odds, or evens—or Btakes—though why
stakes, which would seem to be exclusively connected with beefs, je Wen sais rien.
I find a real bookmaker, an English one, and I bet with an Englishman against
the English horses. Gladiateur was the revanche de Waterloo. Leetle Dock
shall be my revanche d'tSgypte.
Lonch.—But before you do anything serious d VAnglaise, you must hnch.
We have made preparations for lonching} lonching d
VAnglaise, in the very pschutt-est form going. Ana so
there is nothing in the hampers but raw beef, mustard,
pickles, Extra-Pale-Ale-Ind-Coope-Alsopp (the chic-eat
brand out, they tell me in the Rue d'Amsterdam, where
they have a rude insular habit of winking behind the
Gaul's back), and that, with rhubarb-tart and strong
Cheshire frontage, rather startles the untravelled friends
who have vulgarly breakfasted at twelve, before coming.
First Course: Beef. It is rosy to look at, but I would
vastly prefer bouilli. Still it gives a man stamina, and—
and pluck they call it; though why pluck for courage,
when plucking is chiefly associated with pigeons, > n en
sais rien. Second Course: Mustard and pickles. They 're
a retraite aux flambeaux in bottles, but there are other
bottles to extinguish them. Third Course: Pale Ale-
Ind-Coope-Alsopp. I am at my third, and they say Leetle
Dock is running, or Saint Gotten, or—which is the French

of any kind, d VAnglaise, or any other way. For—when
you come to think—of it—they're all English—bred—
born—ridden—and—put me inside the mail-cart.
SONG—TO CATARRH ACCOMPANIMENT.
[Dedicated to Morell Mackenzie, M. D., Author of
"Hay Fever," by a Sufferer.)
0 leafy month of June, whom Coleridge glorified,
My hate of thee in verse shall find a sad vent!
Voicing the woes of many victims, horrified
At thy black advent!
Oh yes, I know thou 'rt green, as songs say, verdant;
To youth, and larks, and other wild things, welcome;
But then I m not a boy or girl, lamb, bird, ant;
With thy sweet smell come,
To me, long hours of pain and tribulation.
Praise of thy fragrances is unbefitting
One whose stern destiny is sternutation
Unintermitting.
Oh, out upon thy hayfields, and thy roses!
(Thy victims cry, if Nature kind gave them brains,)
They only serve to irritate our noses,
And mucous membranes!
For now we know, thanks to Morell Mackenzie,
Moore, and the Teuton Phcebus (scarce a boon to us!),
The causes of the paroxysmal frenzy
That comes with June to us.
Know that what makes each eye a running rill,
And leaves each nose preposterously swollen,
Like a prizefighter's after a long " mill,"
Is simply pollen!
Felix qui potuit rerum—so it goes;
And gratitude of some sort, I suppose, is
Due to the savants who subject one s nose
To diagnosis.
Would Virgil though have found perpetual sneezes,
Headache, and streaming optics more endurable
From knowledge of their cause, when the disease is
Found quite incurable?
Noprophylactio oomes from Dr. Pikebt/s
For swollen eyes and nose-tip like red coral.
"Insoluble—like the most Sphmxian rebus!"
Seems Morell's moral!
Nor is there comfort much to my poor mind
In learning that Hay Fever lays its tax on
Only the folk—poor creatures !—who're refined,
And Anglo-Saxon!
1 love the Rose—oh, passion void and vain!—
But, though most loyal to the garden's Beauty,
To die of her in fierce asthmatic pain
Seems a hard duty.
Hayfields are sweet, but oh, be not deceived!
For their effects specifics prove all sham.
Glykaline cures them not, they 're not relieved
By Alkaram I
My case is hopeless; that is now, I fear,
A Morrell certainty. I await the issue,
Which I suspect will be—oh!—ah !!—oh dear!!!—
Will be Ah-tisshoo!!!!

THE
OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
DIARr OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Thursday Night, June 5.—Back after the
Whitsun holidays; at least some of us. Our Leaders unanimously
concluded to extend holiday.
"Didn't go to the Derby, but shall stay over for the Oaks," Glad-
stone writes to me. "Had regular Haward'n yesterday. Even
with assistance of W. H., couldn't manage it under three hours."
At the top "f -ote humorous sketch of W. E. G. with coat, waist-
coat, and h it utf, shirt loosened at throat, braces hanging'^down at
sides, wieldin i an axe. Old 'un evidently in high spirits.
Stafford Nokthcote peeped in about half-past six, just to see if
Randolph was there; found he wasn't; joyfully disappeared.
Randolph still ruminating in Paris.
"When I take holiday, Toby," he said on eve of departure,
"what I like is thorough rest and change of scene. Life frisky
enough in London. When holiday comes, like to retire to quiet
place, no distractions, where stream hums through leafy dells, where
skies are blue, grass green, and trees leafy, where you go to bed
early, rise late, and eat Vienna bread, soothed by murmur of
innumerable bees. So I came to Paris."
Mr. Pabneix in Ireland buying land for honest peasantry. This
greatly reduces number of our Leaders. Scarcely any left except
Ashmead-Babtlett and Jimmy Lowtheb. A. B. interrogative as
usual. Lord Edjiond Fitzmaurice wants notice of question, as
customary. Jimmy on Front Bench has high old time. Falls natu-
rally into attitude of Leader of Opposition; follows up Lord Edmond
with awkward questions put with childlike blandness. With con-
summate art seats himself between Selwyn-Ibbetson and Sclatek-
Booth, who throw around him quite unaccustomed halo of dull
respectability. Wish we saw more of him.
Next to Right Honourable Gentleman, Peter enjoyed himself most
through long Sitting. Civil Service Estimates on. Question about
"Supply of furniture to the various public offices, the Courts of Law
in England and Wales inclusive of fixtures and fittings." Here wild
field for dissertation through which Peter roved in boundless delight.
Hasn't had such a time for seven years.
Joseph Gillis sitting on solitary watch-tower below Gangway,
"likea rusty raven forsaken of companions," as Habcourt says.
Joseph's gloom deepened as one by one Votes were passed. "£290
for supply of additional racks at the Foreign Office." What do they
want with additional racks at the Foreign Office? Isn't Ashmead-
Babtlett enough, together with the Noble Baron and Wolff, not to
speak of Bourse and Northcote? Here is evidently waste of
public money. Joseph moves'uneasily, but finds little encouragement.
None of his friends and compatriots are near. Earlier in the evening
T. P. O'Connor had been uttering his plaint of the niggardliness of
personal attendance in House. Life-long habitude of luxury made
him impatient with the service offered in the House of Commons.
No silver bells at tintinabulation of whioh come with noiseless
footfall obsequious Seneschal. The House too oold in one place,
too hot in another. No softly gliding bath chairs to take the
Sybarite from one chamber to another. No nicely warmed lift with
musical box playing "The Night when Larry teas Stretched," to
take him up-stairs and down-stairs and in my lady's chamber, with
the grille before it,
Tin Pot having had complaint wrung from his overburdened soul,
had gone his way and was now doubtless reclining in apartments
more in accordance with his use and wont. Joseph Gillis was aban-
doned, and sat mournfully silent whilst Votes rapidly passed.
"Oh! Richard, oh! mon roi,
'Ii'univers t'abandonne!"
Justin McCarthy softly sang in his ear.
"G'lang wid yer foolin' and yer bad langwidge," Joseph sharply
answered, his usually equable temper sorely ruffled.
On the whole a good evening for public business. Begin to think
that, after all, we get on better when our Leaders are away.
business done.—Twenty-three Votes passed in Civil Service Esti-
mates.
Friday.—Some doubt as to whether there would be House at all
to-day. Business not attractive except for Childers and Old Mother
Hubbard, who can't get out of her mind conviction that she ought
to have been Chancellor of Exchequer. Other arrangements
having been made, wags her wise old head over schemes of successive
Chancellors.
"Believe Gladstone's sorry he couldn't secure me as his suo-
oessor," she says. "But couldn't do it, Toby. Principles first,
and place after. Might have helped Dizzy if he'd oome to me in '74.
But of course he knew better. These chits always do. However, I
may save the country yet. Randolph pays me marked attention of
late. Shrewd young man. Makes up his Ministry in time."
Afternoon wore away, Members worn out. At Nine o'clock, House
Counted Out. Susittess done.—National Debt Bill read Second Time.
"Bitter" Experiences.—"The will of Mr.
Bass .... the value of tho personal estate
£1,830,000."
Michael Thomas
amounting to over
Nulli Secundus.—No Second Horse for this year's Derby.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TOWN.
II.—Bond Street.
From orowded Chcpe to Bond Street! Scarce the range
Of a two-shilling fare, yet what a shift

In the kaleidoscope of Cockney change!
Here lounging dandies negbgently drift,
And damosels, in vesture quaint and strange,
Languish along, with slow and languid lift
Of Art-enravisht eyes, each orb a cavern
As mystical as Omar Khayyam's Tavern.
Here heat and hurry are as little known
As in the creed of Oscar. Bosoms pant,
Not as in Mammon's mighty gold-chase blown,
But with Art ecstasy. ^Esthetic Cant
Succeeds the slang of Change. At Art's high throne,
As at Gold's altar, Cant is hierophant:
But Cit, who " bulls" or "bears, and Scribe, who twaddles,
Construct their argots upon different models.
Here Art is Fashion; which interpreted
Means Art's a ruling fad, like pugs or gambling.
And what is Fad? You've seen, when day has fled,
A sheep-flock after a bell-wether scrambling!
The throngs, gregarious soul and empty head,
Who up and down these oft-paced flags go ambling,
Are nought but modish Muttons, held in tether
By " Form," Sooiety's mystical bell-wether.
Observe yon gasping girl! Her pendulous lip
Bespeaks incarnate silliness. At her side
A matron waddles; dry as the last chip
Of some old hulk which long has left the tide
Her wrinkled face! The girl s affected trip.
The broad brocaded dame's slow solid stride,
Seek the last Show, pictorial or plastic,
Of the effeminate or the fantastic.
The dame has no aesthetic thought which soars
Above a pattern-plate; the high-heeled maiden
Feels " dear Btjrne-Jones" the dreariest of bores:
And yet, with catalogue and pencil laden,
They pass, unwilling Peris, the smart doors
Of the last-advertised artistic Aidenn,
To spend two hours within its solemn hush,
Of groaning weariness and gasping gush.
These Fragoline Fitz-Flttke, with smiling scorn,
Remarks, and to young 8andytop appraises.
Poor victims in a sham Art-era born.
And caught by the most comical of crazes.
Behold them! Pioture: Pale Persephone borne
From Enna's stiff-stalk'd asphodels and daisies
By a dun-coloured Dis, dishevelled, flopping
O er his broad biceps, all her blossoms dropping.
"How lovely!" G wend a gasps, and hides a yawn
Behind her catalogue. My dear, what is it?"
Whispers the elder dame, whom Pluto's brawn
Amazes but instructs not. Ah! why quiz it,
Her natural ignorance? She is but drawn
Waif-like by social currents. Every visit
To carpeted saloon and close-hung gallery
Is penance, borne with pluck that checks one's raillery.
0 myriad martyrs of the idol Mode,
That Juggernauth of the much-vaunting west,
With what dull patience do ye drag your load,
Herded and chained! Silent in many a breast
Burns sullen hatred of the social code
Which makes gregarious boredom Fashion's test,
Yet Spartan smiles defy the cynio's scrutiny,
And mute endurance never dreams of mutiny.
Art must be "done"! Shall Fragoline Fitz-Fluxe,
Whose second cousin is an A.R.A.,
And whom the younger son of a Scotch Duke
Is prosing to before the big Millais—
Shall she with her slow scornful smile rebuke
Poor Gwenda's ignorance of, let us say,
The Great Impressionist's wild show of smudges,
Art's last evangel, say the accepted judges!
Perish the thought! Fitz-Fluke, with snowy vest
And sprawling chain, is posing at the table.
He means to buy—his purse can stand the test—
That mystic masterpiece " The Tower of Babel."
He does the public chaffering with much zest,
Fingering nis broadly-flowing gold-link'd cable;
His wife, that solid and capacious matron,
Bridling with pride at playing the Art-Patron.
Shall Gwenda be eclipsed by Fragoline
And the paternal cheque-book thus paraded?
Never! Persephone, in pallid green
Must gTaoe Gwkn's Yellow Chamber. Lank and'faded,
Fitz-Fluke's plump-dowered girl awakens spleen.
The chit, Mamma perceives, is to be tradea
For that on which her own sharp soul's a-watch,
And which is precious e'en when young and Scotch.
And so she flutters like a critic-hen
About the picture; in a stage-aside
Declares 'tis all the taste of her dear Gwen,
Which even Ruskin praised. Papa's great "pride
Is fostering it. 'Tis pleasant when the pen
Can with four figures even rank o'erride!
And then she smiles at the Fitz-Fltjkes serenely,
And leaves them with the stride she thinks so queenly.
See her anon o'er chocolate and cream,
Or cates more solid and more savoury, sitting,
Her worn eyes lighting with some zestful gleam;
Whilst Bond Street butterflies, about her flitting,
Move Gwenda, as no pallid High Art dream
May move her, with light badinage, slang twitting,
That unconsidered incoherent cackle,
Which, somehow, prigs and saps can seldom tackle.
Their horses champ without, their harness glows
In the May sunshine. Slim, stiff-collared stalkers
Upon the Bond Street flags slip in: there flows
An endless flood of those word-clipping talkers;
Each hat's at the same cock, and so's each nose;
From caramels at Charbonnel and Walker's
To Private Views, they know their Bond Street well
As rattling Captain Morris knew Pall Mall.
Meanwhile " Mamma" has finished. Gwenda quits
Her " darling pictures," inwardly quite willing.
These seek a quarter whither prosperous Cits
Do gravitate. Gwenda will be quite killing
To-night on Dis and Enna. What small wits
Owe what wild talk to the all-opening " shilling,"
Which Bond Street boardmen advertise, slow-trudging,
And maybe earn—by a long day of drudging?
Art? Nature? Yes, we babble make-believe
In both great names. But just deduct sheer flam
From Bond-Street Art, the struggles to deceive,
Of those who huckster and of those who sham,
The "rapture," whose cessation is reprieve;—
And what's the nett result of crush and cram?
If solid gain is to be held the test of it,
'Tis surely Trade, not Taste, that has the best of it!
Two Medals Reward !— Recently, at Chatham, Sergeant Harry
Hart was presented with a second good-conduct medal, after forty-
two years' exemplary and meritorious service. The Telegraph said—
"The Colonel-Commandant remarked that, in the whole of his experience,
he knew of only one other similar case, and he urged his men to let this
stimulate them to follow so good an example."
Our surprise is that there should be any other similar case. Forty-
two years' exemplary and meritorious service, and to be still a
Sergeant with only a couple of good-conduct medals, is hardly likely
to stimulate Privates to follow so good an example."

THE TOWN.
-Kensington. Abt at Home.
Ars longa est, and long is the array
Of Art announcements which suffuse the Season

In leaden London with auroras gay
Of rosy promise. When the Embankment trees on
Droops the dim greenery of a cockney May,
Then, borne like swallow chirps Ootober's breeze on,
Where'er Society's parrots flock and chatter,
Resound artistic slang and studio patter.
Show Sunday's come and gone. The bores and bored
Have changed their hunting-ground; the Studio now
With adjectives prolonged, shrill, double-scored,
The ecstatic " Per-iect!" the astonished " How!"
Echoes no longer. Posters tall and broad
Take up the tale, and Pictor's noble brow
Is radiant with peace, with worry pale,
Ruled by the coy contingencies of sale.
What if poor wayward much-vext Hatdon's ghost
Could walk in Kensington? Might he not say,
Watching the opulent artistie host,
"The hour has struck for the Ideal to pay"?
And yet to analyse the agreeable boast
Might lead to strange revealings. Fashion's sway
And Mammon's still are strong, still Taste runs mad,
And Ariel Fancy's slave to brainless Fad.
McThane and Mumbosh! Self-made men again.
But else how different! One his country's pride,
He who to Art brought earnestness and brain
As well as palette-magic. Stride by stride,
With virile mastery, no step in vain,
And few from fair prosperity's path aside,
McThane advances with the splendid ease
Of Phoebus driving o'er the Orient seas.
Whither P To that Art-zenith youthful zeal
Fixed as the goal of toil and vision high,
The Elysium of large thoughts whose strong appeal
The shaping force of sovereign phantasy
Fires to creative splendour i Ah. the steel
Which keeps heroic temper still must try
Titanic tasks. Excalibur's high work
Demands such steel,—not so the knife and fork.
To play the Titan always, straining ever
Toward the unattainable far heights
Ofpure perfection, calls for stern endeavour;
Far pleasanter to woo the soft delights
Of the superbly and serenely clever.
The eagle-pinion plumed for skyward nights
May pulse through storm-wrack with a joy ecstatic,
Butth ere's much comfort in the tame villatio.
Ask Mumbosh—Mumbosh of the mummy face,
Macassar'd much, a fivefold millionnaire,
Whose whisks and wrigglings of Whitechapel grace
And swaggering angularities of air
Make the nerves quiver. At his " little place "—
A spacious palace midmost of Mayfair—
His painted visage proudly dominates
A miUionsworth of Art,—at current rates.
The mighty Mumbosh was a shopman's drudge,
A hawking Dulcamara Bmart at " patter ";
Then he " conveyed" a patent,—simple fudge,
Say for a plaster or a soap, what matter f—
Its owner he outjockeyed and bade trudge.
Mumbosh had potent faith in cant and clatter,
And cant and clatter, plus a little cash,
Saved him, though seven times on the verge of smash.
The verge? nay, o'er it. But an oily tongue,
Shrewd schemes and "no effects" were nis protection
Against extremity. He would have hung
Blue heaven with posters, spread the foul infection
Of lying hideousness eve's stars among,
Or "billed" the dawn, if by such coarse subjection
Of Nature to the Advertiser's art
He could have given his wares another start.
But now, his millions sacked by world-spread guile,
He turns Art-patron on a princely scale;
Name-led, yet shrewd at market-rates the while,
Arch quickener, not of genius hut of sale.
His "taste" might move McThane's broad British smile,
But proud Msecenas might with envy pale
To find his connoisseurship's bright renown
Dimmed by the cheque-book power of a clown.
And yet if, like the tasselled falcon, Art
Stoop to the flattering touch of Mammon's hand;
If Humbug, having played its huckster part
To the great golden end, will swell the band
Of the sham cognoscenti, if the mart
Is reared amidst the Muses' sunny land,
What help, since Art itself espies no dangers,
Although its temple swarm with money-changers't
May Satire scourge them thence? Why, Midas now
Is a sleek gentleman who undertakes
To gild the laurels on the uplifted brow
Of Genius. Studio splendour, wealth that wakes
Philistine wonder, brings blue blood to bow
Before the easel—these are highish stakes
In the great social game, which if Art play,
Even a Mumbosh serves to pave the way.
Too sour? too sweeping? Well, these mansions proud,
These studios sultanesque, these halls immense,
The fulsome cackle of the applausive crowd,
Are no rewards of dull incompetence.
When Pegasus with the clown's oxen ploughed,
He was winged hippogriff, no packhorse dense.
But Art is false to Art's supremest claims
Which stoops with willingness to vulgar aims.
Plasters to please earth's hordes of easy gulls
Tax only common craft, whose guerdon's gold;
But Mammon the fine edge of Genius dulls,
Finds it inspired, and leaves it tame and cold.
The man who on Town's pavement chalks, and culls
Scant harvest, smears for bread: his claim is bold.
But many a canvas on a gilded wall
Is but superb "pot-boiling" after all.
Immortal Art! Thou proud prerogative
Of the great weakling, Man, Promethean gift,
Redeeming the dull round wherein we live,
Piercing life's cloud-pall with a roseate rift,
Whence gleams a light great Science cannot give;
Creative force, which worldly pride and thrift
School to subservience, till men blindly bless
The creeping palsy of a low success:
Not thee the facile flout, the airy sneer
Assail successfully! But, fashion-fed
And lucre-lured, thy votaries, who might peer
With Art's unbending Abdiels, bow the nead
To social shams, and sleek the Midas ear
Of any huckster-humbug who has bled
Fraud-sullied ducats freely, proud to score
In Genius one blind tributary more!

ance this Season of Mr. Charles Wtndham as Geoffrey Gordon in

OUR INSANE-ITARY GUIDE TO THE HEALTH
EXHIBITION.
Paet II.—" The Eat-eetes."
As, seemingly, the great object of nine-tenths of the Exhibitors
at South Kensington is to excite the appetite of the passer-by, it is
not surprising that by eight o'clock he becomes ravenous. From the
moment of his entrance his senses have been dazzled with displays of
the most seduotively-arranged food. Now his eyes have rested gloat-
ingly upon vast piles of bon-bons, now gazed greedily at seemingly
uncounted stores of wedding-cake. He has paused for a moment,
and some enthusiastic inventor of compressed vegetables or wafer-
biscuits has forced earnestly, nay, almost brutally, a specimen of
the " extract of cuoumbers " or the " skeleton picnic " into his unre-
sisting mouth. But although these oppressively gratuitous morsels
may appease for a moment, they cannot stave off the desire for
dinner. As this Handbook is nothing if not practical, the Earnest
Seeker after Health shall be told how to proceed in his search for
substantial food.
Say, then, it is eight o'clock on a "Wednesday evening. The
subject of my care has just returned from the Albert Hall, where he
has listened to Bismarck's Cuirassiers defiantly blowing their own
trumpets. He has made mental notes of the remarks he has heard
about their broad shoulders, their white uniforms, and their want of
medals. He has joined in the burst of admiration that has rewarded
their efforts to play music written for the sweetest of strings upon
the brassiest of brass. He has grown so accustomed to their tours de
force that were he told that they were just going to imitate on a
couple of dozen trombones the bleating of a lamb or the warbling of
a nightingale, he would receive the intelligence without the faintest
soupcon of astonishment. He has noticed their cavalry swagger and
their fondness for beer, and has returned to the Entrance-Hall.
Before him is the Southern Gallery. In the distance he sees little
groups, composed of the heads of families and their wives and
daughters, gravely tasting this and tasting that. One old gentleman
is sipping, seemingly much against his will, a new kind of coffee,
while another, wiQi no better grace, is gloomily regaling on con-
densed milk. Our Earnest Seeker after Health pulls himself together,
and makes for the Dining-Saloons.
His first visit is to the apartment devoted to "outs off the joint" and
"plainest dinners." He knows from experience that here he can
usuallv get a fair meal—if he likes to take pains over it, a very good
one. But to-day is Wednesday, and the crowd is what "Robert"
would call "tremenjus." Every table is occupied. Sad would-be
diners stand at the entrance, gazing with savage resignation at
those who are feasting. Hungry Dowagers vainly seek for redress—
some try to wheedle a passing waiter to get them a place, others
attempt to bully the Manager. But neither course brings with it
dinner. There is no room for the Public, so no one wants its com-
pany. So the Health-seeker gazes with respect at the fortunate
Sssessor of a plate of hot boiled beef, and mournfully passes away,
aving left Salon I. he comes to Salon II., where an even more
desperate crowd are waiting for food. Were it not Wednesday—a
half-crown day—some alarm might be felt at the angry spirit of the
crowd. The enhanced price of admission, no doubt, has secured a
better class of people than those who usually patronise the place on a
shilling day; still there is mischief in the air. It only wants a
William Tell or a Masaniello to constitute himself leader of the wild
and hungry throng to carry the tables by storm, capture the joints,
and possibly massacre the waiters. After pausing m vain for some
ten or twenty minutes, to see whether Fortune will smile upon him,
and give him a place, the Health-seeker turns his back upon " cuts
from the joint," not only in sorrow, but in anger, and continues his
promenade along the South Gallery.
Rather roughly refusing the ministrations of a charitable Gentle-
man, who would feed him with several mouthfuls of some patent
food or other, he comes to a crowd of well-dressed people hovering
near a turnstile, who are evidently victims to the demon Indecision.
Now some of these individuals advance, and peer into an apartment
beyond the turnstile, and then hurriedly retire, as if they had seen,
like Virgil and Dahte in the Inferno, some terrible sight; ultimately
they all disappear towards the Machinery in Motion, with heads
bowed down, (glistening eyes, and other symptoms suggesting the
mournfulest dejection. But the Earnest Health-seeker is not to be
turned aside by the deportment of these "feeble ones" (as the

departing crowd would certainly be called in the English translation
of the libretto of an Italian Opera), so he braces up his nerves, pro-
duces a silver coin, which he exchanges for a red token, passes the
turnstile, and finds himself in—
The Shilling Dinner!!!
On either side of him are thin bench-like tables, plentifully gar-
nished with crumbs and dirty glasses. There is a bar at one end,
and a kitchen, seen through an open window, at the other. When
the eyes of the Health-seeker have grown accustomed to the bustle
of some Waitresses of uncertain ages, in what appear to be nightcaps,
who seem excessively fatigued, he notices that amongst the diners are
many well-known faces. He recognises, for instance, that old gourmet,
Jackson of the Columbus Club. In the coffee-room of the palatial
establishment just mentioned Jackson is the master of his slave the
Steward, and the terror of all the waiters, from the Head downwards.
If his soup is cold, if his entree is overdone, if they have dared to send
up mint-sauce with his lamb (" A mistake, Sir! It absolutely ruins
the flavour of the meat!"), Jackson's wrath is so great that its
eohoes can be heard in Charles Street and St. James's Square. In
spite of this, here is Jackson, with his eye-glass and his white hair,
and his hat on one side, eating the Shilling Dinner I He smiles a
rolicksome smile as he catohes the eye of the Health-seeker, and
devours a rather messy plate of boiled fish as if the proceeding was
replete with humour, but he keeps hit back upon the entrance and
the peering crowd beyond! Next he attempts a jocular flirtation
with a Veteran Waitress who has brought him some mutton, cut very
near the knuckle, and assumes the air of a Don Giovanni who is " dog
enough" to sacrifice his digestion to his love of adventure. The Vete-
ran Waitress (who probably is the grandmother of other waitresses)
is surprised and flattered at Jackson's unexpected gallantry, and
brings him a pieoe of dry pudding dabbed down upon a plate, with
muoh old-fashioned coquetry, upon which Jackson orders, with a
knowing wink, a penny-worth of cheese. Then the deteoted and
economical gourmet looks round with a glass in his eye and a smile
on his lips, on the chance of recognising some face he knows by sight,
who, if so recognised, will be then and there invited to assist in the
capital jest of Jackson detected in stealthily eating, d la Don Juan,
a Shilling Dinner! By this time the Health-setker will himself have
finished hit messy portion of boiled fish, hit mutton cut very near
the knuckle, and Am dry bit of pudding dabbed down upon a plate.
He will go out, after putting some pence in a sort of wooden pyramid
for the benefit of the Veteran Waitresses, and walk to the end of the
Gallery. He will here be attracted by the wax presentment of some
food under a glass-case, which will excite his envy. On closer
examination, the Health-seeker will find that the viands at this
moment so strangely fascinating to him compose the dietary of a
convict sentenced to a term of hard labour!
Vert Little "More where that came from."—In the Daily
Telegraph we read that, at the Earl of Clabendon's Bale, Pommery

"Oi'd loike zum o' that in a moog." And to think that we should
have to pay twenty shillings a bottle for this at a Restaurant's, and
then—not get it, there being a mysterious process called " blending,"
which impairs the quality without diminishing the price. A
"Blender, —in this sense, at least, as there is fair blending,—ought
to be punished as if he were a " Welsher," or something like it,—at

RATHER LARGE AND EARLY.
It is with regret that we found ourselves unable to accent the invitation of
Messrs. George Edward and Sons, of No. 1, Poultry, E.C., to inspect at a private
view "the Gold Casket designed and manufactured by them to the order of the
Corporation of the City of London for presentation to Earl Shaftesbury," for
from the printed circular appended to their voucher Messrs. George Edward and
Sons appear to have produced between them quite a unique specimen of this style
of art. "The Casket," we are told, is of Gothic design, and displays, among some
striking features which include " the City Griffin," "the Arms of Earl Shaftes-
bury," not only "enamelled in their proper Heraldic colours" but, and this
is quite a fresh and subtle surprise,— flanked by festoons of fruit and other
rich ornament." The clever mystery which is here suggested appears to be
continued in some other portions of the design, modestly described as "very
appropriately symbolical of the labours of his Lordship for the well-being of his
fello w-men, particularly for those who stand most in need of such assistance."
"The Casket," continues the explanatory Voucher, " is surmounted by the figure
of an Angel, representative of that Providence whose instrument Earl Shaftes-
bury has ever considered himself. The figure hovers over a well-olad boy
and girl, the latter industriously plying her knitting needles." But with a
strange and quite unnecessary limiting of the Earl's practically providential
powers, we are told that lower down, "a ragged crossing-sweeper and a poorly-
clad female with hunger-smitten children," are to be found "flanking the
Casket." This is a grim and rather ill-natured set-off to the attitude of the
Angel presiding over the well-clothed youth and industrious maiden higher up.
As, however, some broken fetters indicating "freedom from vice and ignor-
ance," are oonspicuous on the reverse panel, while "a lighthouse, behind which
the sun has just risen above the horizon," giving "promise of a brighter day,"
and this, too, "in repoussi work," stands in the background, it is to be
presumed that the hunger-smitten children can at least feed upon hope, which,
by the way, in a manner very amusingly suggestive of a hearty meal, is repre-
sented round the corner by a real anchor. Though no doubt a little puzzling
to the virtuoso without the aid of the explanatory voucher, the whole design
of the Casket does considerable credit to Messrs. George Edward and Sons,
and it ought, if he can find a convenient place to Btow it, not only to please
but even surprise Earl Shaftesbury.
LAYS OF A LAZY MINSTREL;
A STREATLEY SONATA.
Ah! Here I am! I've drifted down—
The sun is hot, my face is brown—
Before the wind from Moulsford town,
So pleasantly and fleetly!
I am not certain what's o'clock.
And so I won't go through the Lock;
But wisely steer the Shuttlecock
Beside the " Swan" at Streatley!
And when you 're here, I'm told that you
Should mount the Hill and see the view;
And gaze and wonder, if you'd do
Its merits most completely:
The air is clear, the day is fine,
The prospect is, I know, divine—
But most distinctly I decline
To climb the Hill at Streatley!
My Doctor, surely he knows best,
Avers that I'm in need of rest;
And so I heed his wise behest
And tarry here discreetly:
'Tis'sweet to muse in leafy June,
'Tis doubly sweet this afternoon,
And so I '11 land and lunch and moon
Before the." Swan" at Streatley!
But from the Hill, I understand
You gaze across richrpasture-land;
And fancy you see Oxford and
P'raps WaUingford and Wheatley:
Upon the winding Thames you gaze,
And, though the view's beyond all praise,
I'd rather much sit here and laze
Than scale the Hill at Streatley!
I sit and lounge here on the grass,
And watch the river-traffic pass;
I note a dimpled, fair young lass,
Who feathers low and neatly:
Her hands are brown, her eyes are grey,
And trim her nautical array—
Alas! she swiftly sculls away,
And leaves the " Swan at Streatley!
She's gone! Yes, now she's out of sight!
She's gone! But still the sun is bright,
The sky is blue, the breezes light
With thyme are scented sweetly:
She may return! Here's lunch at last!
I'm glad enough to break my fast,
And make an excellent repast
Within the " Swan 'r at Streatley!
BEARDING THE BARD;
OH, ANOTHER LITTLE INTERVIEW.
Upon the public announcement the other day that,
"Owing to the innumerable Manuscripts and Letters
sent to him, Lord Tennyson wishes it to be understood
that in future he cannot undertake to answer the letters
or return the MSS.," we thought—writes a certain journal
—it might be of public interest to learn from Lord
Tennyson's own lips his views on this and other subjects.
One of our Staff accordingly called on the Poet Laureate
at his Lordship's private residence, and the following
dialogue ensued:—
Questioner. Can you give me some rough idea of the
number of letters received at your residence every day?
Lord Tennyson. No, I can't.
Questioner. I represent the Editor of the Sell-Well
Gazettet and I think it would be likely to be extremely
interesting to the innumerable readers of that journal if
your Lordship were kindly to favour me with some
notion of who your great-grandmother was, the place of
your own early education, the number of times you were
birched at school (if at all), the different publishers you
have employed, your Lordship's method in oomposing
verse, &c, sc. I gathered just now from the attendant,
who seemed to be watching me rather suspiciously in the
hall, that your Lordship composed standing up. Would
you kindly inform me where you usually stood when

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Lord Tennyson (angrily). On my head, Sir.
Questioner. Indeed! That is very interesting. May I
further inquire what is the nature of the literary work
on whichyour Lordship is at present engaged P
Lord Tennyson (more calmly). "Well, I don't mind
telling you that I am bringing out a Political Epic,—
composed in the intervals of business in the House of
Peers, which is a good deal better than anything in the
Iliad. Poor old Milton can't hold a candle to it—but
then, you see, Milton wasn't a Lord, like me. As for
Browning aud all his works, why,
Questioner. Oh, of course. But this Political Epio?
May I ask who are the chief characters in the story?
Lord Tennyson (condescendingly). You may. Mr.
Gladstone is King Arthur naturally, and then Lord
Salisbury stands fur Lancelot,.viho.!a just-run off with
Guinevere—that's the public opinion of the country, you
know. Am trying to work in " G" in the Fortnightly,
but the subject does not lend itself readily to poetry.
Think of making Escott into Merlin, you know. Tnen the
"Passing of Arthur" has to be turned into the Passing
of the Franchise Bill by Arthur—or in other words by
Gladstone—but it's all rather difficult to manage.
Questioner. Quite so. Evidently the Poem will be
highly allegorical. Does your Lordship find claret or
champagne the best liquid to take as an aid to composition?
Lord Tennyson. Neither. All my most recent verse
has been produced on a diet exclusively consisting of milk
and water. That was what made The Cup so sparkling.
Questioner. Indeed? And now I should be glad to
know what the object is of the individuals who send their
MSS. to your Lordship, as stated in the Daily Papers.
Lord Tennyson. I cannot conceive. There are exe-
crable imitations of my choicest poetic gems—the May
Queen seems to specially attraot the efforts of the emula-
tive poetaster. Then an anonymous person wishes me to
express my approval of some Songs after Sunset, and,
by the hand-writing, I believe them to be the work of
Mr. SwiNBtrRNE, who thus wishes to creep into a little
notice through my recommendation.
Questioner. And the letters you receive? Would you
mind giving me a specimen or two of the sort of corres-
pondence that pours in upon you?
Lord Tennyson. Well, this morning I've received an
offer of a "handsome commission" from a firm of lucifer-
match makers, if I could say something flattering of
their "Unbearable Brimstone Vestas" in verse, in the
style of The Charge of the Light Brigade, if possible.
The proprietor of an East-End Musio-Hall also wishes
to know if I am open to an engagement to produce some-
thing startling and melodramatic, in the style of Maud,
for his theatre; and a travelling Cirous asks if I think 1
could manage to dramatise The Princess, so as to make
it suitable for their leading equestrienne. Everybody
writes to me as if I were completely idle _
Questioner. Instead of being engaged in writing Idylls!
They really ought to be ashamed to "vex the Poet's
mind" in tnat way.
Lord Tennyson. "With their shallow wit." Yes. So
ought you. Then an American Showman writes to say
that there are "thousands of dollars in it" if I were to
come over there, like Ievtno, and recite some of my
poems—The Revenge, for instance—dressed in my House-
of-Lords' robes, on public platforms. Dickens did it, he
says, and he had no robes, so why the dickens shouldn't
IP He tells me I should be paid liberally, by results.
Evidently these poor plebeians don't know what—or how
much—is due to a Peer of the Realm.
Questioner. I have only one more question to pnt to
your Lordship. If your Lordship would kindly acquaint
me, in blank verse, if possible, with the name of your
hatter, the date of your last new shirts, and
Lord Tennyson. Minion! Am I to be insulted in my
own house P Fawcett has yet to read and writhe under
my Lyric about the Parcels Post. But to be asked the
name of my hatter! Perhaps yon would like to know
something about my bootmaker,—because
\_At this point our Energetic Jnterviewist was com-
pelled to leave, having an engagement elsewhere.
Necessary Caution.—An American says that when-
ever he sees an advertisement of "Raised Pies;" he
immediately wants to know, " where they were raised."
And should he taste them, his first question generally is,
"How's that for High P"
A TALE OF THE DOVER EXPRESS!
How did I do it P Well, sit you down, if you've got ten minutes to spare,
And I '11 tell you the tale how it happened to me—well, to me and my mate out
there.
Don't put it all down to our boast and brag, for I '11 take my oath we try
We engine fellows, to stick to the rail, if we happen to live or die.
It isn't because with filth and grease we are covered from foot to head
That we haven't got pluck like soldier Bill in his uniform smart and red.
TV e haven't got bands to tootle to us, nor women, nor mates to cheer,
We march at the sound of the station-bell, and the scream of the wind in our ear,
We have gals to love us, and children, too, who cling to the face and neck,
Though we 're never called to the grand parade, or march'd to the hurricane deck,
A man's a man when he does his work—well, it may be more or less,
But in Fenian days you should say your prayers when driving the Dover Express!
We started off—'twas a night in June—and the beautiful moon shone bright
Through the silent glass of the station, when our Guard sang out " All right!"
He was in charge of the train, the Guard—but me and my mate just then
Had taken in pledge, for good or for ill, the lives of the women and men.
Away we went at a splendid pace when we'd coupled and left Heme Hill,
Behind was the roar of a city on fire, in front was the country still.
Then we came to a point where we always turn, and mutter a sort of pray'r
For the wife and the young 'uns asleep in the town, from the men in the engine's
glare.
It wasn't like that in the train, I bet, did anyone trouble a rap P
The honeymoon couples were locked in fast, and the others werejplay in g at' nap';
Papers, and smoking, and gossip, and chaff; does it ever strike them that a nerve
Is required from the men who must drive in the dark an express round the
Chatham curve P
I looked at my watch, we were up to time, and the engine leapt and sped
To the river we cross as it runs to the sea, with the Rochester lights ahead!
I often think of the train behind and the passengers fast asleep.
As we slow on the pace just to tackle the curve round Strood and Rochester Keep.
It puzzles those foreigner chaps who cross where the river in silence flows,
With the Castle one minute miles away and the next right under your nose.
You have felt the jerk? Well, that's no odds, maybe you'd have felt more odd
With a mate by your side at the engine-fire, who suddenly cried, "My God!
There's something ahead on the six-foot way! Look there!" And I held my
breath.
A something! And what f on the"rails ahead—we must drive for our lives or
death!
There wasn't a second to pause or think, though I saw by the lights of the train
The river, the viaduct, scenes of home we never should visit again.
"What shall vou do?" Then I turned and saw Tom's piteous face and sad.
"What shall I do P Hold fast, my boy! I shall cram on the pace like mad!"
Off with the brake, and shove on the steam—in a second a crash, a leap,
Right into the iron the engine tore, with the passengers fast asleep.
It reeled at the shock did their devilish snare, to the rush and the roar and the beat,
Before was dear life and the light and the air; behind was the dust of defeat!
Away to the rear went Roohester town, its danger, its storm and stress,
We'd taken a pledge, and we kept it, Sir, in saving the Dover Express!
They 're sending the hat round! thank yon, kind, for me and my mate, you say,
Well, the money will come in easy like, when we 're laid on the shelf some day.
It's only right that the women and men who arrived at Dover town,
And were saved that night round Rochester curve should cheerfully " plank it
down."
But we don't want money for what we've done—there's something better than gain
If a man can earn his Victoria Cross in charge of a railway train!
If a man can prove he bos plenty of pluck, and is thoroughly English made,
As well in front of a fierce express as in rear of a bold brigade!_
But there's something far better than money to me, tho' it's terrible hard in Town
To give the young 'una their annual shoes, and the missus a decent gown,
I'd give your money up every cent, and the moment I 'd gladly bless
When you hand us the villain who wanted to wreck our lives on the Dover Express!
"Field Experiments at Woburn."—Last week the Royal Agricultural
Society made their annual inspection of the manurial experiments upon the
estate of the Duke of Bedford at Woburn. It was all very nice, and the cul-
tivation, as the Times reports, "as clean and perfect as possible." We wish
we could say the same of that other property of the Duke of Bedford's, which
Mr. Punch was long ago compelled to christen "Mud Salad Market, the pro-
perty of His Grace the Duke of Mudford." What a blot it is in the centre of
London! Last Friday afternoon, about four, it was beautiful to the eyes and
sweet to the nostrils. The carts were all along Tavistock Street, and well
down into Southampton Street, and the threading of the labyrinth by our
cabman, who, of course, chose this as his shortest cut to Fleet Street, was as
exciting as a N.W. Passage, and as interesting as " manurial experiments" at
Woburn, where of course the Duke is Lord of the Manor, and in Covent Garden
he is Lord of the well, we should spell "manor" in a different manner,
but we only wish that the Healtheries Committee, in one of its Conferences,
would just be a little practical and suggest some way of benefioially dealing
with the manurial righto of the Duke of Mudford in Mud Salad Market.

time, that the law could not be quick or cheap, and that if it
ever became either the one or the other, it would he "the greatest
misfortune that could happen to the country."
A certain licence is allowed to the funny man in an after-dinner
speech, but this bit of waggery at the City Banquet from the distin-
guished, and learned comique of the occasion, is almost a little too
strong. That Englishmen, as their miserable legal machinery is now
contrived, had best not go to law at all, is obvious enough; for what
is known as " going to law" means for them nothing more or less
than contributuig a ruinous subscription to the support of one of the
most bare-faced and grasping monopolies that a comparatively free
and intelligent people have ever tolerated. What has the Merry
Master of the Rolls to say, for instance, to the costs in the not-yet
forgotten case of Belt v. Lawes t or, for the matter of that, to the
ousts of a thousand and one other oases daily cropping up, in which,
injustice, no matter how grave, being done, there is no sort of remedy
to be had as things stand, save for those who have a purse long
enough to make the loss of a year's income or so a matter of com-
parative indifference. That the bringing of such "law" as this to
any man's door is not exactly .the kind of boon to provoke a display
of grateful fireworks, no one wiU be likely to dispute.
But with all deference to the Legal Jester of the Mansion House,
there is no question but that the sooner the very poorest man in
England can get full and entire justioe, without paying for it, the
better it will, be even for Buch a humorous big wig as the Master of
the Rolls.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June 9.—Woodall about the House
again to-night; back from Aix-les-Bains. Hardly knew him.
Cheeks hollow, eyes unnaturally bright, limbs shrunk, shoulders
bowed, and one leg fully an inch in girth stouter than the other.
"Don't seem to have left your aohes at Aix," I said, with true
compassion, for there's not a better fellow in the House than Wood-
all, though apt to be imposed upon by Lovely Woman.
"No. Toby," he said, with weary, listless air. "There are some
aches that no baths oan wash away. Mine are heart-aches. Haven't
had a moment's peace since I took up this conf I mean this great
cause of Woman s Suffrage. Never knew till now the deathless per-
sistency of Woman. Night and day she pursues me. Dread the
postman's knock; began of late to go out the baok way, but they 're
round there now. May as well go out like ordinary householder
who '8 paid his taxes. Great mistake for single man to undertake
the work. Caine should have done it, or. better still, Jacob Bright
should have stuck to it. He was all right, I believe. In his time
question kept strictly on broad political grounds. Good-looking
oung fellow, unmarried, has no business in this Galley. L. B. does
ier best to keep crowd off; but begin to suspect L. B. herself. Wish
it was over. Couldn't survive another fortnight."
Newry Riots up at Question Time. Gibson severely asks whether
Parnell's friends in peacefullyperegrinating Newry were advised
by police not to pass Orange Hall? This too much for Tre-
velyan. Orange Hall, it appears, is in main street. Why should
Parnellites go by back-way because two ferocious Orangemen waiting
for them in hall with loaded pistols? House has suffered a good deal
with Parnellites, but loudly cheers Trevelyan's generous outburst.
Franchise Bill went off to-night in Committee like can of dyna-
mite, only nobody hurt. Little revolt by Scotland: something about
payment of Poors'-Rates. The Mackintosh moved Amendment. On
Division defeated by 194 Votes to 9; upon which The Mackintosh
folded himself up with deftness only acquired by lifelong habit, buckled
strap, and got Ramsay to carry him out of the House. "Put me away
for a rainy day," he said, with tear (or perhaps raindrop) in his voice.
At ten minutes past One, Christopher Sykes discovered on his
legs, curiously regarding Speaker through eyeglass; evidently quite
surprised to discover someone in the Chair. As he tea* there, however,
Christopher begged to move the Second Reading of the Oyster,
Crab, and Lobster Bill. Loud oheers from all parts of the House.
Cries for further explanation. Rather a bore to explain a Bill,
especially with new pair of gloves on. But must be done. Seems
that oysters taken to swallowing each other, which leads to scarcity;
crabs no longer walk backward into basket, and lobsters claim to
have a voice in the components of salad. "It is, Sir," Christo-
pher observed, with a fresh look of surprise in face at discovering
Speaker still in Chair, "with no shellfish purpose that I move in
this matter, but these things must be nipped in the bud. It is enough
to have Agricultural Labourer demanding Franchise. Can't permit
spirit of revolution to extend to our shellfish." Loud oheers, during
which Christopher, after solemnly staring all round, resumed seat.
Business done—Original clauses of Franchise Bill passed through
Committee.
Tuesday— Saw Woodall again at Seven to-night. Looks ten
years younger, cheeks filled up, both legs getting same size. "Got
my speech over, Toby," he savs, "for which, thank Heaven. Never
catch me in mess like this again. Haven't spent quiet night or day
for last two months. Free now, and mean to keep so. Got a couple
of notices written,one for baok door, other for front. 'Back in an
hour,' it says. Women Beeing that, will have to go away. Of
course they '11 come back in an hour, but they can't do it for more
than day or week at most. If that doesn't do, shall go to some quiet
place, and give out that I'm gone to China, leaving full address.
Women doir t like paying fivepenoe for postage, and that '11 choke 'em
off. Perhaps one or two will follow. One, I'm sure, will. She can't
get out and home under four months, then we shall be in Recess.
But it's dreadful work, Toby, the scheming and dodging for honest
and innocent man. Begin now to understand position of Captain
Bunsby. Can't read some passages in my Dombey and Son without
tears wetting the page."
"Well, you made a very good speech," I said, seeing he was getting
low again. "Best statement of case yet done. But what did you
mean by marriage being the 'solitary vocation of woman' P"
"Thinking of L. B.," he said, in hoarse whisper. "Cases where a
man, specially of amiable disposition, can't avoid marriage. Still he
might like to take it solitary."
Mr. Toots MacIver down at quarter to Nine, peering into recesses
of Library, opening cupboard-doors and smiling vacuously at vacuity.
"Don't see many down yet," he said. "Thought there might be
one or two got in these places by mistake. Mr. Bigoar promised me
a House at Nine, and I Know he '11 do it. Great thing for me to have
his patronage. Took me up up at Birkenhead, you remember;
makes me quite easy about my seat there."
Quite true. Joseph Gillis has highest opinion of Mr. Toots.
Came down to-night at ten minutes to Nine.
"Don't you be afear'd,"he said to T., whose spectacles were dimmed
with emotion and excitement. "Put your trust in Joseph and he '11
pull you through."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
But Joseph didn't. Notion of coming down at Nine to hear
Mr. Toots not attractive, even though coupled with opportunity of
having a shy at Chamberlain. So iust as Mr. Toots had commenced
to read his speech, written on hacks of letters in own handwriting,
addressed to himself, House Counted Out.
"Shall I go for 'em," said the Game Chicken, whom Toots had
provided with seat in Distinguished Strangers' Gallery. "Jest pint
'em out, Master, and I '11 show 'em daylight through back of their
bloomin' 'eads." Game Chicken turned up cuffs and ominously fixed
eye on Joseph Gillis, who was crossing Lobby, and in another
moment would have been exceedingly surprised.
"No, no; come away," said Mr. Toots, tremulously. "All a
mistake. Of no consequence. These are my best friends."
Business done.—Franchise Bill in Committee.
Wednesday.—" Any news to-day from Egypt?," I asked Lord
EDMOND FllZMAUBICE.
"Yes," he said, "there's been another rising."
"What is it this time, the Wady-Halfians?"
"No, the Nile."
Don't know much about foreign politics, not so muoh for example
as Ashmead-Bartlett; but this sounds bad. If the very rivers of a
country rise, things must be in dangerous way.
A very pleasant afternoon with Scotch Members. Something about
Ecclesiastical Assessments. Fancy things must be rather gloomy in
this respect. Never heard anybody so melancholy as Sir Alexander
Gordon, till Colin Campbell appeared on! scene. Emotion so pro-
found could hardly hear him. Seems to be sad case all round.
Depression shared by audience. Would have given half-a-crown for
one of Healy's yells or Joseph Gillis's shrill " Hear-hears." Deep
vein of prevailing sorrow in Scotch constitution. On the whole
would rather attend a funeral than the Adjourned Debate on the
Ecolesiastioal Assessments (Scotland) Bill.
Thursday.—Trpprrrr Witchett, the Maori King, down to-day
with his Chiefs. Seats provided for them in Distinguished Strangers'
Gallery, usually occupied by friends of Irish Members. Nice intel-
ligent Gentleman TirriTTT, though tattooed.
"Think of having House of Commons of mv own when I go back,
Toby," he said. "Rather fun to sit in big chair, and order fellows
round. Mean to be my own Speaker'and Sergeant-at-Arms."
"I trust your Majesty has recovered from vour recent indisposi-
tion P" I asked. Always respectful to Royalty, though, like Tim
Healy, wouldn't know a Crown Prince if I met him in street. If I
had met Tippittt Witchett about Westminster, would have thought
he was goiDg to Aquarium, or coming back after performance.
"Yes, all right now. Court Circular, I am told, said it was
rheumatism. Fact is, Toby, it was sausages. Saw dish of them, for
first time, at breakfast three days after I arrived. Tasted them;
enchanted; more like—ah! well, don't you know we never do it
now, but there was a time—well, in delicate flavour more like old
times than anything. Ate fourteen. Told they 're bad things in hot
weather. Nobody looking; put two off dish into trousers-pooket.
Secretly ate them. That's what did it. Know better in future.
Draw the line at fourteen."
Tippitty rather bored with House. The Great Chief Goubly
Wobbly fell fast asleep whilst Lord John Manners speaking.
Tippitty chiefly struck by Stansfeld.
"Who's that engaging young thing with hair nicely oiled and
parted down the middle '<" he asked.
"That's the Right Hon. James Stansfeld."
"Funny ways you English have. Here's a woman spoiled, and a
man not made. Suppose he's Member for Middlesex?
Some difficulty in waking up Gobbly Wobbly. Said he hadn't
slept much last night: would like to hear another speech.
"Sell sausages?" TirpiTTY whispered, as we passed refreshment
counter.
"Not in their native simplicity," I said; "might get you one
enveloped in thin crust of paste."
"Get me four, dear boy," said His Majesty, a faint blush of eager
anticipation showing itself through tattoo-marks. Pressed four
sausage-rolls into his dusky hand. Most interesting man. Quite a
Child of Nature. Business done.—Woodall's Woman's Suffrage
Clause rejected by 271 Votes against 135.
Friday.—Franchise Bill taken at Morning Sitting. Seemed to be
going right through. But, with object of cheoking undue exubera-
tion on part of Government, Whitley, Warton, Hicks, Tomltn-
son, Tom Collins, and Charles Lewis interposed, and managed to
get Bill thrown over.
At Evening 8itting that young Sybarite, T. P. O'Connor, who
last week complained of absenoe of silver bells, Bath-chairs, and
liveried servants in House, now took up question of Egyptian Loans.
Revelled in references to millions sterling. In fact, so free and easy
on matter that, as Goschen showed, not particular to twenty millions
sterling, here or there. Pretty to see.Goschen rattling Tin Pot and
showing how empty it is, except of parched-peas.
Business done.—Franchise Bill getting forrader.
AN IMPORTANT MEETING.
A meeting of the "Look-a-head" Radical Club, of Chelsea, was
held on Monday last, Mr. Froth presiding. Among the distin-
guished visitors present were Digby Grand, Esq., Richard Swiv-
eller, Esq., Mr. Deal, Mr. Jeremy Diddleb, Baron Nathan,
Sidney Beer, Esq., M.P., Sir Blowitt Windbag, Mr. Micawber,
Mr. Alderman Badlie, the Hon. A. Hairtongue, Mr. Florry
Carnt, Mr. Bunkum, Mr. Grab, and many others.
The Chairman said thatxhis meeting had been called to consider
what steps should be taken for the purpose of filling up the many
lucrative situations in the Grand New Municipality that would be
created by Sir William Harcourt's magnificent Bill, when it
passed. ("Hear, hear!") They had had a long time to
wait. They had worked like Niggers, and stuck at no amount of
lying and slandering, so they could fairly lay claim to the first
onoioe in the numerous good berths that would be vacant. (Loud
Cheers.) He should be happy to receive any proposition that might
be suggested.
Digby Grand, Esq., said that he cordially agreed with every word
of their learned Chairman's eloquent address, and he believed he
should strike a chord—not [the lost chord—(a laugh)—with which
they would all harmonise, when he proposed that they should head
the list about to be sent to their grateful friend, Sir William Har-
coubt, by the name of their honoured President, as Deputy Mayor,
at a salary of £4,000 a-year. (Loud Cheers.)
This was seconded, in an eloquent speech, by Mr. Micawber, who
said he would willingly surrender his claim to the coveted position,
not doubting but that something would turn up that, as the song
says, "would just suit him." (Laughter and cheers.) The proposal
was carried nem. con.
The next office being that of Chamberlain, Mr. Jeremy Diddler
ventured to observe that, as the principal duty of that officer seemed
to consist in borrowing various sums of money, his long experience
in that line would seem to point him out as the right man in the
right place. This irresistible claim being at onoe admitted, he was
selected unanimously,—salary £3,000.
The office of Principal Trumpeter was at once assigned to Sir Blowitt
Windhag. The office of Judge of the Small Debts Court was allotted
to Mr. Deal, his large experience in that direction being his prin-
cipal recommendation.
The Hon. A. Hairtonoue thought that as the office of Remem-
brancer required a Gentleman of great tact, good temper, and
polished manners, perhaps he might be thought to be admirably
suited to that important position. (A laugh.) He was then selected.
Mr. Florry Carnt begged to suggest, that, as the office of Comp-
troller was created for the purpose of controlling any exaggerated,
or misleading, or untrue statement, made by any of his brother
officers, he thought that the Meeting, with their thorough knowledge
of his little peculiarities in this respect, and his well-known rever-
enoe for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, could
not do better than select him for this somewhat difficult position.
Sir Blowitt Windbag said that, on the principle of set a thief to
oatoh a thief—(" Order.'")—he meant no offenoe, he would propose
that, which was carried.
The President said the next office to fill up would be that of City
Solicitor, and as that would, in the future, be an office of very grave
responsibility, as the largely-inoreased rates would, no doubt, be
received at first with great dissatisfaction, and would require much
firmness on the part of their legal adviser, he should propose that
their well-known friend Richard Swiveller, Esq., be selected for
that position.
Sidney Beeb, Esq., M.P., said he was somewhat surprised to hear
this last statement of the President, as he, Mr. Beeb, had always
declared, and so had his big brother, that there would be no increase
in the rates. Could the President say what the rates of the f ature
would bet?
The President confessed he could not, as finance was not his forte;
in fact, he always carefully avoided it; but it had been publicly
stated by the Chief Commissioner of Works for the City, that it
would probably be about sixteen shillings in the pound, or about
three times the present amount.
The Treasurer was selected for the office of Common Crier. It was
objected that he had made a very good thing of his office by the
interest received upon his large balancos, but he repudiated the
charge with indignation, as his largest balance had never reached
£300, and nearly the whole of that was drawn out in the following
month, to pay the expense of their frolicsome Lambs—(a laugh)—for
attending their bogus meetings.
The Club sat till a late hour, but, before separating, every member
present was able to join heartily in their popular chorus:—
"I think in the new Municipalitee
I something have found that will just suit me!
And that was why I came here, my boys,
That was why I came here!"

THE TOWN.
IV.—Matfaib. A Thing of Beauty.
Beauty in Babylon? As a butterfly
Lit on the horn of Behemoth, it seems
Incongruous! Yet Bceotia hath
an eye,
Like Polyphemus, and indul-
ge th dreams
Of Galatea. Passion's lyric cry
Upward through London's
brumons welkin streams,
As through the Athenian blue,
in burning praise
Of the strange modish Charts
of our days.
A Fashionable Beauty! 'Twere
a text
For Luclan or for Heine.
Lesser lyres
May try it, but the ear of
wisdom, vext
"With much hysterio thin-
toned twangling, tires
Of expectation; whosoe'er the
next
Town twitterer boudoir love-
liness inspires,
The Mayfair manufacturer of
triolets
Will hardly win the Ionian crown of violets.
Yes, Beauty's fashionable, and to-day,
Like other modes, is just a branch of trade,
Self-advertised in as serene a way
As soaps or corsets; lavishly displayed
Like coarser " goods." 'Tis not the modern way
For Amaryllis to affect the shade;
The nymph has turned a bold, unblushing boaster
In photograph, trade-ciroular, and poster.
Fair Amaryllis! She at seventeen
Was sweet and fresh as her own Devon lanes,
But greed hath eyes ubiquitous and keen,
And Beauty to the mart is brought like brains.
An English Cressid? Nay, restrain your spleen,
Thersites! Greek devioe no longer reigns.
Beauty is made a marketable toy,
But scarce in the frank fashion of old Troy.
How? Mothers, husbands, chaperons may reply.
The many-mystery'd art hath various phases.
Beauty that poses in the crowd's coarse eye,
Or panders to Society's daintier crazes
Must sacrifice the sweets of privacy,
Show open, common, cheap as summer daisies,
But hath she not reward when each quack bill is
Bright with the beauteous bust of Amaryllis?
Trade subsidises Art. Mumthbumbo's braces
Are blazoned to the world by an R.A.,
And why should womanhood's seductive graces
Not serve the counter Croesus P Trade can pay
For its commodity of pretty faces;
A Duchess in artistic negligee,
Or loose-robed star of Stagedom's light o' loves,
Both help to push the sale of hose or gloves.
So Amaryllis moves, Queen, not of Love,
But the queer realm of quidnunc Cockneydom:
In its strange fame some few degrees above
A skipping stage chit. Little lyrists strum
Her praises, proud to play the Paphian dove
About her car of triumph; painters come
To do her canvas-homage, all as hollow
As neo-pagan paeans to Apollo.
Helen, Aspasia, Cleopatra,—these
Were Passion's frank, unfaltering ministrants;
But 'tis not Antony or Pericles
Whom Amaryllis charms; her postulants
Are modish mannikins, the dregs and lees
Of the effeminate coteries and cants,
Who swell the silly legion, never scanty,
Of the homunculi and the dilettanti.
Poor Beauty! Handmaid of this cackling herd,
Star of the social pageant hired for show!
What Puck-like tricks the Imp of the Absurd
Plays in this world! Beauty perforce must go
Where'er Sooiety's languid pulse is stirred,
Shine at a race, or pose in a tableau,
To please the Argus mob whose gloating eyes
Gleam praises which are veiled indignities.
Theme of the Club-room's cold and cynic chatter,
The Peeping-Toms of Pressdom gush and gloat
Upon her published charms, her graces flatter,
Appraise her lips, or eulogise her throat.
The common quarry of the Cad! What matter
If he display a starred and broidered coat,
The counter-jumper's oily hirsute twist,
Or the smart frook of the smart journalist?
Hail, conquering Cad! Thy spirit widely rules,
Late risen from its native home, the gutter.
The Clotens of the Senate, Press, Clubs, Schools,
Thy bald brutalities now boldly utter.
Who now of courtesy or candour pules?
The cleverness that Cockneydom would flutter
Is blatant, self-assertive, rancorous, rude,
The ape of 'Arry's every mode and mood.
The chuckling'ohurl, who flattens his snub nose
Against the window where the flaunted charms
Of Amaryllis glow in graceful pose.
With Lady Limpet's white bewitching arms,
And Mrs. Merle, the sumptuous southern rose,
Competing conqueringly, thrills not nor warms
Like rustic Cymon to a nigher sense,
Quickened by beauty's calm omnipotence.
He grins and gloses as they glose and grin
In courtlier sort in gallery, stall, or stand.
There is no touch of inspiration in
The pitiful parade that makes the land
Accomplice in destroying what should win
Defence of every honest heart and hand,—
That privacy of home which vulgar bribes
Leaves at the meroy of Society scribes.
And Beauty's self? To paint her inner war
Of hope and fear, ambition, shame, disgust,
Needs divination. But a Social Star
Shines for its season only; Pharaoh's dust
Is not more dead than banished World-Queens are,
If Beauty be not shrewd to make the lust
Of the orowd's curious eye yield solid gain,
Than memories of past triumphs what more vain?
Of Beauty and the many-headed Beast
A later legend phantasy might frame.
Who '11 try the task? The Poet or the Priest?
Nay, zeal is honey-tongued, and satire tame;
But the fierce Prophet of the fervid East
Might strike in London homes the trail of shame,
Though wide the difference, as 'twixt flames and lilies,
Between Aholibah and Amaryllis.
Most Inappropriate.
The commemoration of the Tercentenary of the murder of William
the Silent will take place at Delft on the Tenth of July. The
Times says:—
"Professor t>b Vhibs, of Leyden University, considered the most effective
speaker of Holland, hag consented to pronounce an oration over the splendid
tomb of ' The 8ilent' in the New Church of Delft."
Fancy commemorating William the Silent with a long speech!
The proceedings ought to be in dumb show, and his health drunk
in solemn silence in a glass of Mumra all round.

Those symphonies in black,
Brave in their silken sheen,
The graceful sable hose,

ing:
They 're doomed, alas! alack!
The flying skirt I ween
No longer will disclose
The dainty black silk stocking!

THE
IE OF PARLIAMENT.
BXTB.ACTED FHOX
DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June 16.—Full attendance in Lords
to-night, to hear lecture by the Macullum More. The Duke in
high feather. Smashed around at Irish Land Bill. Greatly delighted
Conservative Lords. Even Markiss smiled grim approval.
"Macullum ought to be one of us," he said. Give 'em Cairns
and Richmond in exchange."
Duke very hard on late colleagues, but manages this thing better
than Fobsteh. Doesn't excite same feelings of resentment, though
not less dangerous as candid friend. General sense that the Duke is
a little late with his warning. Useful speech before Land Act
passed, trifle out of date to-day. Still, a hne fiery speech, full of
that wisdom which comes with knowledge of accomplished events.
Sat down at end of two hours and quarter.
"Any More, Macullum?" I asked.
"Not to-day. Toby," he said, wiping his massive brow with
pocketbandkerchief embroidered with family motto—" Ne oblivis
carts." (Lobd Mayor tells me this, being translated, means
"Dinna forget." Suppose this is what's called elliptical sentence;
full meaning, "Dinna forget this is Dook of Argyll's pockethand-
kerchief. Observe it with respectful eye. Touch it not with
desecrating hand.") "But this only first of series. Mean to take
all Acts of Parliament as far back as Magna Charta, deliver lecture
on each, showing how much better they'd have been if I'd drafted
and carried them through. Working baokwards, like one of Chris-
topher Sykes's crabs, I'm timed to reach Bill of Rights, August,
1885."
In Commons Mr. Toots MacIveb still aotive in spite of discomfiture
of Tuesday night. His mission is to put down Chambeblain. Feels
pretty certain of success. Asks abstruse questions about composi-
tion of Board of Trade. Conservatives wickedly cheer him on.
Liberals roar. A sudden terror seizes Mr. Toots, sits down on
Puleston's hat.
"It's of no consequence," he said, seizing Puleston's hand and
warmly shaking it. "Of no consequence at all, I assure you."
Education Estimates on. Capital speech from Mundella.
"Think so ?" asked Stanley Leighton. "You wait a bit. See
me make mincemeat of it."
Mundella down. The Man from Shropshire up, waving arms,
talking in excited manner, just as he used to in the Chancery Court.
Unfortunately no ushers here to put him out. Their services reserved
for Bradlaugh and Irish Members.
"Nice, well-meaning man, Leighton," said Dr. Farquharson,
eyeing him" with professional air,—"but don't you think he's—ah!
—hem—a little 't Over-pressure at school, I fancy, is working out
results. Curious how excited ho gets on questions relating to Lunacy.
Remarkable case. Shall watch it."
Business done.—Education Vote taken.
Tuesday.—Encouraging rumours of Count Out to-night. Warton
came down to do it. Surprised to find over forty Liberals in their
places. Chiefly Gentlemen accustomed to ballot for Wednesdays.
Bring in every year Sunday Closing Bills, Burial Bills, Extraordinary
Tithe Bills, ana the like. Warton, or Folkestone, or Tomlinson.
when half-past Five reached, and Division imminent, get up, and
talk out Bills. Determined to put Btop to this; so Stevenson brings
in Resolution, declaring that Bills reached before Two o'Clock on
Wednesdays shall be divided upon, Warton Nobton, nolens volens,
at Five o'Clock.
Very small House except for cluster of Radicals, and thin black line
of Parnellites who have some dirty linen to wash. Suddenly Premier
appears. Just looked in in dinner-dress, makes brief speech in sup-
port of Motion, and goes back to dessert.
"Good Heavens!" cried Bebesfobd Hope, who shared Front
Bench with Ibbbtbon. "This will never do. Shall have these
fellows passing all kinds of things on Wednesday afternoons. Per-
haps disestablish the Church between lunch and five o'clock tea."
Only six Conservatives present. Rest scattered far and wide.
Even Rowland Winn presumed to dine. Great routing out of
Ex-Treasury Messengers. Boot and spur and Hansom cabs, and off
to Clubs ana dinner-parties. Conservative Gentlemen roused by cry
of "Obstruction in danger!" leaping across the walnuts and the
wine, rush down to House. At doorway throw off appearance of
haste, and stroll listlessly in, as if there bv accident. Original six
became a dozen, twenty, forty, eighty. Still they came with charm-
ing aspect of having dined leisurely, just looked in, hoping didn't
intrude. Nobthcote in new and glossy opera-hat, Hicks-Beach,
and Smith, and Lord John, and the rest. _ Cavendish Bentinck
more rumpled than ever. Grand Ckoss, in dinner dress, boldly
walked full length of House. Evidently no quotations from Prime
Minister to-night.
Ever seen tide run up on level strand, filling wrinkle here and hole
there, silent, irresistible, till where sand was water shines? So
Conservative benches filled up. Every man in dinner-dress, and
everyone with same determined look of accidentally turning up.
Irish Members oonsulted. Would they vote against Government't
Joseph Gillis rather thought they would. So Motion for Adjourn-
ment suddenly moved, and Resolution which, an hour earlier, seemed
certain to be carried, rejected by 115 Votes against 92. Business
done.—At Morning Sitting progress of Franchise Bill stopped.

EARLY PREJUDICE.
"Oh, Mamma! when Baby begins to talk, what a dreadful thino if we find opt hb 'a an Irishman!"
Wednesday.—House adjourned at Three this morning. Met again
at Noon, or should have met, but couldn't get forty men till One
o'Clock. Have written to one of the Faotory Inspectors. Get him to
come down and see how many hours we work, and then shall enter
upon prosecution. Not sure whom to prosecute. Think I '11 try the
Speaker. Bradlaugh didn't make much out of Sergeant-at-
Arms when he went for him. Speaker sure to say he can't help it;
but can't hear these personal pleadings. If it isn't him it 's somebody
else. Every respect for Mr. Peel, but law must be vindicated.
Church Patronage under discussion this afternoon. Lutheb Me-
lanchthon Labouchebe gave his views on Church Reform, going to
root of matter in pleasantly direct way. Incidentally mentioned that
whilst not desirous of prolonging existence of State Churoh, didn't
particularly love landlords. They aleo to be swept away. Man of
singular directness of mind, Mr. Labouchebe. "Would have made a
figure in Paris in 1769-82.
Business done.—Church Patronage Bill read Second Time and
referred to Select Committee.
Thursday.—Serious business at Question-time. Gladstone in
incautious moment recklessly challenged accuracy of statements by
Ashmead-Babtlett. This of course can't go unnoticed.
"If there's one thing I pride myself upon," Ashmead says, "it is
perfect accuracy on matters of detail."
Questions over, Ashmead rose. Loud cheers from Conservatives.
"I suppose," said Chaplin, with air of disgust, "he's going to
put some more of his questions."
"Not at all," said Cavendish Bentlnck, who had been cheering
till his astonished hair stood straight up, and surveyed the scene
in search of cause for the turmoil. "Not at all. He's going for
Gladstone. Hear! hear! hear!"
"Oh, that's another thing!" said Chaplin. "Hear! hear!
hear! hear!"
Ashmxad's bearing of unusual solemnity. Not accustomed to be
oheered in this way. Recognition come at last. Not surprised at it,
but must bear himself calmly in hour of triumph. When Ashmead
sat down, Pbemieb discovered excitedly holding out right hand.
"No no," said Ashmead, shaking his head with stern resolution.
"He must apologise first. Bear him no enmity. Can well under-
stand he would rather have me as friend than enemy; but before
I shake hands with him he must make the amendy honorahble."
"It's your papers he wants, man," said Macfaelane.
"Oh!" said Ashmead, a little crestfallen. Walked across the
floor, and gave Premier his manuscript. Peemike couldn't read
it, so Ashmead sat beside him on Treasury Benoh, and pointed out
quotation.- Quite touching picture to see the two great men thus
hobnobbing. Truce only temporary. Ashmead scaroely safe back in
seat, when Peemieb opened fire, shrivelling up Ashmead, and
blacking his Eye.
Truthful James looked on with keen delight. "We must keep
this going," he said, and rose with genial intention of casting oil
over spreading flames. But Speaker ruled him out of order, and he
subsided. "Regular marplot," Jimmy muttered. "Spoilt best bit of
fun offered for months."
Got through Franchise Bill by Ten o'Clock. At Eleven, leaving
few old fogies to discuss Customs and Inland Revenue Bill, House
adjourned to Smoking-Room. Labbt got up little entertainment with
Stuart Cumberland. Gladstone came along and joined in sport.
No one, to see him with his legs on table, long clay pipe in mouth,
hat tilted on back of head, and pot of shandy-gaff at his elbow, would
have recognised in him the magnificently wrathful man who six
hours earlier had eaten up Ashmead-Bartlett.
Entertainment very successful; mean to have a series. Two end-
men Christy Minstrels engaged for next Thursday. Arrangements
for Thursday week not yet settled. Either be Toole in Paw Claw-
dian or David James in Reminiscence of Middletcick.
Business done.—Franchise Bill passed through Committee.
Friday.—Rosebert takes the floor in Lords to-night. Calmly
states opinion that House is capable of improvement. At very time
Peers preparing to throw out Reform Bill in other House, here's a
young Earl, who's been travelling in America, Australia, and other
low countries, suggesting that they shall reform themselves! Cold
shudder ran through House. By two Divisions, Motion emphati-
cally dismissed. Stbathnairn bo overcome that twice in suc-
cession voted in wrong Lobby.
Business dune.— Sunday Closing Bill talked out in Commons.

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER.
Our important occypation, allers a werry responserbel and diffyoult
one, becums more dinyculter at this festive seasoning, by reason of
our large amount of travelling. We are litorally here to-day and
gone to-morrow. Wat with Cristel Pallises, and Stars and Garters,
and Obern Restaurants, and Epping Forestes, we reelly are quite
ellergibble for The Travellers' Club. Last week, we had a large
party at the old " Maypole " at Chigwell, that everybody knows as has
red Bamaby Budge, and a nioe jovial party they was. They was, I
spose, from their oonwersation, the Directors of a Semetery Company,
and a werry good time they seems to have had on it lately, bisness
being partickier brisk. They seams to keep two parsons, one for the
Churchers, and the other for the Chapellers, and they was both there,
and was both drunk, as usual, and both returned thanks in neat
speeches. The reel Chairman, and a old worn-out Chairman, was
both werry late, and didn't set down till the Lam was hup, but jest
to see 'em set to work to make up for lost time, was a site to see, and
they acshally owertook 'em at the custads! The wines was par-
tickler good, considering as we was in the Country, some nioe torny
Port being speshal nice. The speeches was short and full of fun, so
I spose as they'd bin a-paying a jolly good dividend out of the
Semetery. Brown told me as they sumtimes, when times is bad,
does the same as the Horfloers does in the Indian Army, that is,
drinks success to Scarlet Fever! but Brown is so romantick in his
untruthful stories! They had some music in the drawring-room after
dinner, but the only Bongs as I herd was " The Burial of Sir John
More," and "The Death of Tom Bowling," both of which I spose
is considered perfeshnal. It's a nice little plaoe is the " May Pole,"
and though they do jest a little gammon the litery people about
which was Mr. Chester's room, and when the poor Raven died, and
setterer, for a nice little dinner in the nice little old-fashioned way,
and a nice little drive through the beautiful Forest, with everythink
as clean as a wissell, and as holesome and as happytising as can be,
and for being made artily welcome, I don't no where you can beat it.
Praps for gents who loves wariety as well as high living, there
ain't no life as beats an Ed Waiters, excep praps a Prince's.
To only think that 24 short hours shoud see me transfurd from
simple old fashoned Chigwell to the helegant Hall of lie Washupfool
Company of Wintner's! Ah wot a change was there, my Country-
men! Everythink that Hart, and Taste, and Culshur, and Money
could perduce, was perduoed there and dooly aprioiated. The Menew
was suburb; and that's wen I alius feels quite in my glorv; for I
have really a great delight in waiting on a Gent who gives his hole
mind to his dinner. There's sum peeple on whom a scrumptious
Maynew is quite wasted. They shakes their pore heads, which must
be even emtier than their pore stummocks, and says, no thankey to
amost all the richest ontrays. It would quite brake a Shef's art to
see 'em, and amost brakes mine. This egstrornary display of higno-
ranoe is werry common aiming the werry ighest classes, suoh as
Princes and Dooks, but werry rare among Liverymen and Common
Counselmen, excep wen they've got a touch of wot Brown soma-
tically calls the Livery complaint. On this werry oocashun I waited
on a well-seasoned Common Councilman, and did he say no t hanky
to anythink without looking at it? Suttenly not. "On oontrary,
as the French says, everythink was well examined, and my egspe-
rienoed opinion asked of most of 'em.
Won thing rayther surprised me, he didn't, take not no sauce with
his sammon7 "Wot, no sauce, Sir P" says I. "No," says he, play-
fully, "nor no cheek neether, Mr. Robert!" Wen I took him a
dellycate slice of Saddle of Mutton, which seemed amost lost in the
middle of the plate, I says, "Shall 1 get you a little more, Sir?"

"No, Robert," says he, "if it were an air's bredth bigger I couldn't
ha' touched it!" And wen I said " Duckling or Ginny Fowl?" he
said, "I will look at the Duckling first!" Ah, that's the sort of
Gent for my money, though I wasn't the sort of Waiter for his, for
he didn't give'me nothink when I asked him if there was any think
more I could do for him. But its a pleasure to wait on such as him,
for one feels as his efforts, and the .Stiff's efforts, has been propperly
apreciated, insted of being wuss than wasted.
I allers likes to offishyate at the Jolly Wintners, cos I allers gits a
flass or two, or ewen three, of my old favrite '47 Port, (not "'74
ort," Mr. World, who shoud have seen it was a meer lapsus lingy
on the part of the Composer, by putting the horse before the cart),
which, I am truly grieved to say, seems somehow or other to be a
gitting scarcerer and scarcerer, and nioerer and nioerer every day.
Arter Dinner I had a werry serious talk with the Butler upon this
werry pint. "Robert," he said to me, in his most sollemest tones,
"Sir William Arcourt little knows all the mischief as he and his
colleegs is a doing by their silly threats of egstinguishing the Gilds
and the Copperasnun. Why, praps you'd hardly beleive it, but even
my governors is acshally a hesitating in laying in the usual stock of
the werry finest wines, and then wot's to become of us all a few
years hence?" It was a question too arrowing for a mere werbal
anser, so, almost without knowing what I did, I tossed off a bumper
of, never mind what, rung his honest hand, and wanished.
Robert.
THE DUKE OF SEVEN DIALS.
Our Special Comic-Song Writer says:—" I could not help thinking
'The Duke of Seven Dials' was a capital title for a humorous song,
but I have been most awfully bothered about the rhymes. The
correct rhymes would be 'trials,' 'vials,' or ' denials,' but I could
not bring them in anyhow. The only other I could think of was
Ltall. I know some people named Lyall (at least, I used to know
them), and, of oourse, I could bring them in—in the plural—say,
'the family of Ltaxls.' I tried it, but it really spoiled ihe song. 1
then got desperate, and, in submitting the following verses, I offer
an abject apolofry to Mr. Punch's sensitive readers for the rhymes I
have been positively compelled to supply."
"THE DUKE OF SEVEN DIALS."
I fell in love with Dolly on the Twenty-
First of June:
I asked her when she'd wed me,—she
replied, "Oh! very soon."
I introduced her to my Ma and to my
Uncle Giles,
And I ventured to introduce her to the
Duke of Seven Dials.
I shall never forget my Dolly,
I shall never forget her smiles;
But I'm sorry I introduced her to the
Duke of Seven Dials.
Our courting days were happy—ah! as
happy as could be.
My Dolly was most charming and affec-
tionate to me.
She gained the best opinions of my Ma
and Uncle Giles;
And one of her great admirers was the
Duke of Seven Dials.
I shall never forget my Dolly,
I shall never forget her smiles;
l et I'm sorry I introduced her to the Duke of Seven Dials.
I took a little villa on the Bedford Park Estate,
But shopping is a process that I positively hate.
I did not then foresee the future, or my Dolly's wiles,
Or she shouldn't have done her shopping with the Duke of
Dials.
I shall never forget my Dolly,
I shall never forget her smiles;
But I'm sorry I introduced her to the Duke of Seven Dials.
The wedding-day arrived, but Dolly never came to Church.
I hunted for her high and low—(we all joined in the search).
A party said he saw her getting over country stiles,
And enter a Registry Office, with the Duke of Seven Dials.
I shall never forget my Dolly,
I shall never forget her smiles;
Yes, I'm sorry I introduced her to the Duke of Seven Dials.
I really felt inquisitive about this noble " Dook."
In vain I hunted JBurke and Dodd and every Peerage Book*

The Duke of Seven Dials.
I ascertained at last His Grace's proper name was Biles,
And he'd purchasedf or eighteenpence the title " Dukeof Seven Dials."
I shall never forget my Dolly,
I shall never forget her smiles;
And I'm sorry I introduced her to the Duke of Seven Dials.
I hurried to my villa on the Bedford Park Estate,
But every stiok had been removed at quite a reoent date.
I meant, of course, to find a home for Dolly and her smiles,
But I'm hanged if I meant to find a home for the Duke of Seven Dials.
I shall never forgive my Dolly,
I shall never forgive her smiles;
But I'm sorry in future I must cut the Duke of Seven Dials.

Dolly elopes with the Duke of Seven Dials.
LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE
About Other People's Business.
My dear David,
"It's 'Ot!" and that makes me think of you in Our Boys
delighting a perspiring audience, and yourself unable to visit either
the Healtheries of an evening, or the Theateries, or the Music-
Halleries, or the Germany Reedy Galleries, where they have a new
entertainment, which I must see, in order to relieve your anxiety, as
you won't go to a matinee, and you can't go to a soiree.
How about the French plays? you say. Well, Madame Judic
>o, I"
Madame Judic, sylph-like though her form be, can hardly look the
school-girl, and the audience are required to "make-believe very
much" in order to realise the fact. M. Christian is very good as
the Commandant,—but he plays a Russian Prince in La Cosaque in
precisely the same style, which is against him as an aotor,—and
Lassouche is droll as a drunken Brigadier, which seems a bit of
charaoter written to order. He only appears in the Second Aot.
I am sure you will approve of this self-abnegation of this French
"Character-actor," who is satisfied with just coming on and " getting
his laugh " two or three times in one Act, and then being " heard no
more"—for that night. Don't you know some of our " character"
men who might probably have asked the Author to bring them in
earlier in the piece and once more in the last Act,—and so ruin their
part and the piece entirely P La Cosaque is a stupid piece, but
Lassouche is very droll in it, and Judic sings charmingly.
I should like to have heard that you had Deen going to play Sir
Andrew Aguecheek in the forthcoming Twelfth Night at the Lyceum.
Years ago, when you were in frills and shorts, were you taken by
your parents to see Twelfth Night, as produoed by Charles Kean.
at the Princess's? /was. Keeley played Sir Andrew, and My!!
how we all roared,—aye, even before he had uttered a word. What
a stolid, fatuous, booby his Sir Andrew was! Not a merry Andrew
himself, but the cause of immense merriment in others.
The Malvolio was Drinkwater Meadows, not a great Actor, but
a very dry one,—and therefore well christened " Drinxwatee." Is
Malvolio so wonderful a character? You know best, but certainly
he was swamped on that occasion by Keeley, Addison as Sir Toby,
Mrs. Keeley as Maria, and either Alfred Wigan or Harley as
the Fool. Still, I can quite anticipate what Henry Irving will do
with him, and I expeot his Malvolio will be a palpable hit. Miss
Ellen Terry's Viola in boy's costume ought to be a companion to
her picture of the Rising Junior whom that unprincipled old leader
Bellario sent to "devil" for him in the celebrated case of Shylock
v. Antonio. I am afraid you won't see this present revival of the
old Twelfth Night which we saw when we were Our Boys together,—
early-hour-Boys in those days,—and you will have to trust to the
report of your ever faithful Nibbs.

TO SUPERSEDE LAWN-TENNIS-THE BUBBLE-PARTY.
LES GRA.NDES EAUX;
OR, NEXT TIME THE FOUNTAINE8 PLAY.
This was the fifteenth day of this remarkable and now historic
Sale, and the excitement, instead of showing any signs of abatement,
on the contrary reached almost to fever neat, the appalling and
exhaustive prices touched yesterday appearing to nave merely
stimulated the publio frenzy to madness. A strong body of police
was again in attendance. On the Auctioneer entering the room a
few minutes late, an angry howl from the impatient but distin-
guished and densely-packed throng clearly showed that the contest
for the day's lots would be both eager and sharp. A violent Duke
or two, and a celebrated Viennese Collector having been felled by
the official hammer and removed by the police, after a brief contest,
in which the world-famed Oubbio Candlestick, a rare gem of Art,
covered with blue strawberries intertwined among leopards, Titans,
and water-cresses surrounding a recumbent figure of Philip the
Seventh, had been used as a weapon and shivered to atoms, the
proceedings commenced.
The general result of the Sale is furnished below; but the following
are a few of the most interesting objects of this afternoon's instal-
ment :—
_ 1769. Urhino Safety-Match-Box. A very fine specimen. Lustred

Lady (age unknown) seated on a dolphin in the prongs. This unique
article ae cuisine, which brought at the Washingford Sale, only
thirty-five years ago, but one bid of one shilling and eightpence half-
penny, was knocked down together with the successful purchaser,
after a severe physical contest, in which the Auctioneer was badly
hurt, for the really handsome offer of £45,090 10*. The announce-
ment of the sum, whioh had risen slowly for two hours-and-a-half,
by bids of 21s., from £15, at which this chef d'ceuvre was started,
was received with frantic yells of delight; several well-known con-
noisseurs, who had been too tightly jammed against the table, going
into such hysterics that they had, by common consent to be let
down through the window, and taken to the nearest fever hospital.
Several other celebrated lots followed, the prices ranging from
thirty to ninety and even a hundred thousand pounds, according as
the temperature of the now suffocating room stimulated or depressed
the ill-temper and obstinacy of the rival bidders; but the climax
was reached when the one and notorious great piece of the splendid
collection was put up, the beautiful patent self-cleansing Cistern of
Andrea del Robbio & Co.
The appearance of this gigantic masterpiece, together with its
taps, waste-pipe, ball-cock (Florentine), and enamelled directions for
use, was the signal for an outburst of ruffianly enthusiasm that was
only quelled by the vigorous expulsion of another batch of Dukes
and noisy virtuosi in the immediate vicinity of the hammer.
The bidding, however, soon, amidst a deadly hush, commenced in
grim earnest and was worthy the magnificent specimen that elicited
it. The details of the famous Cistern are too well-known to need
recapitulation here; but a short summary of its salient points may
be interesting. On the arabesques in the re verse panels the gods, in
blue enamel, are taking tea, Diana of Poietiers, Henby the Second.

preserved fruits. Curiously intertwined with these, in pink
majolica, are a hevy of startled bankrupts bathing, while Agamem-
non, who has on his helmet the initials D.C.L., is chasing the
Emperor Maximilian the Seventh and Henry the Bold (in
effigy as Girr Fadx) over an arabesque of dessert-knife handles,
affidavits, open oysters (seconds), and Italian irons (1501).
Started at £94,000, this costly objet d'Art soon reached £570,300,
when, by a few rapid jumps of ten thousand at a time, it ultimately
touched merely the miserable and paltry figure of £970,510 10s., and
it had scarcely been knocked down, amidst a fearful howl of indig-
nation at this sum to a gentleman who declined to give his name,
but was supposed to be an agent of the Army and Navy Stores, when
a furious onset was made by disappointed bidders upon the cistern
itself, and in a few moments fragments of the priceless domestic
treasure were flying about all over the neighbourhood.
The military being called out, after the auctioneer and several
well-known European buyers had been freely immersed in the
Charing Cross fountains, the proceedings of the day terminated.
The Sale will be continued as usual to-morrow, and its progress is
awaited with considerable interest.
OUR INSANE-ITARY GUIDE TO THE HEALTH
EXHIBITION.
Part III.—The "Lampebies."
Having disposed of the "Eateries" (for really the Vegetarian
Dinner is scarcely a subject for experiment), one naturally comes to
the Gardens. Scoffers have declared that the Fisheries of last year
enjoyed their enormous popularity almost entirely on account of the
grand evening fetes, which became of such frequent occurrence
towards the close of the Season. Certainly, this Summer, the Great
Establishment at South Kensington has been particularly well-
attended after nightfall. The rival bands at the Kiosks, the thou-
sands of Chinese lanterns, and the display of fountains have all had
their influence in emptying the Exhibition and filling the Grounds—
which are sufficient grounds for continuing the Exhibition as a
permanency. No doubt a Grand International Walking-Stick
Contest, or a Cosmopolitan Collection of Cotton Night-caps, if
wedded to "bands in the Grounds, and concerts in the Albert Hall,"
would do just as well as Fish or Biscuits. Next year we are to have
Inventions (with " bands, &c, &c"), and in 1886 Colonial Exhibits
(with " bands, &c, &c"), and probably by 1890 we shall have come
to Toothpicks (with "bands, &c, &c"), and then, most likely,
it will be time to think of repeating once more Fish and Biscuits.
But, whatever may be the subject of inspection inside the building,
outside, in the Ground's, Lights and Musio will hold their sway.
Happily, the propensity of popular science in this country is to
run to skittles. The Crystal Palace at Sydenham (where, by the
way, a most admirable International Exhibition is at this very
moment being held) commenced its career with the highest aspi-
rations. The British Public were to be shown the architectural
glories of the Alhambra and Pompeii, and soon found themselves
watching the evolutions of Leotard and Blondin. In like manner
the Westminster Aquarium was inaugurated by the Duke of Edin-
burgh, as a sort of supplement to'' the mission of Albert the Good,"
but soon had to fall back upon Zazel and a "Variety Entertain-
ment." So it should not create astonishment if, to " strengthen" the
attractions of South Kensington, next year there are found amongst
the "new inventions" a troupe of performing dogs and monkeys,
and a talented Gentleman who publicly drinks, at advertised intervals,
beer while balancing himself on the top of a pole upon his head. But,
assuming, to avoid argument, that everything about South Kensington
this season must be in the cause of health, then " the Lamperies " may
be taken as a sort of "constitution tester." To more fully explain my
meaning, say that you have a wealthy but unreasonably hearty mater-
nal grandmother, and you wish to test her constitution. Regarded from
this point of view, the night fetes have a special interest of their own.
Let us assume that your maternal grandmother has been lured up
to Town with red cheeks, born of country air. She is very rich, and
ou know that you benefit considerably under her will. In common
indness, you are forced to ask her to the Healtheries, and once get her
past the turnstile, and the game should be in your own hands. Of
course, you will give her dinner. Be generous, and do not attempt to
starve her, although you may think that it is within the resources of
Brompton civilisation (especially with the aid of "the shilling meal")
to effect that object. No; let your hospitality be all but limitless, in
fact, let it be only bounded by a cut from the joint on one side, and
a portion of cheddar cheese on the other. Get her, moreover, into
a proper frame of mind for undergoing your experiment, by plying her
with large quantities of low-priced " Beaune." If these preliminaries
are properly managed, the dear old Lady, accustomed only to weak
cider and one o'clock dinners, will become quite frisky by eight
o'clook, and inform you that she is then ready to "eDjoy herself
thoroughly." You will now lead her into the Grounds, pausing for a
few moments to admire the crystal burst of illuminated loyalty on
the part of the Water Companies, which you will find in a sort of
back-yard not far from the Entrance Hall. Your maternal grand-
mother will at once give a proof that the temperature of the Grounds
differs from that of the building by sneezing. This should encourage
you to take her to have, al fresco, a cup of India tea, whioh will be
served to her on damp grass by maidens, chiefly garbed in pocket-
handkerchiefs. Her constitution may be further sounded, at this
point of the treatment, by the administration to her of an Australian
ohop, eaten in a gusty passage near '1 Old London."
By this time she will have become more or less acclimatised, when
increased tests will be necessary. A chair should be secured for her
close to the big drum in the Western Kiosk. When she is once
seated, she will be unable to get up for some little time, on account
of the promenaders accidentally converting her toes into a temporary
door-mat. Any inconvenience, however, occasioned by this mistake
will be forgotten in the pleasure she will derive from listening to the
hangings of the big drum, and watching the extinguishing effects of
the East wind upon the candles in the lanterns. As nine approaches,
you will invite her to follow you, to see the fountains illuminated by
the electric light. Unless a martyr to acute rheumatism, the dear
old soul will assuredly accept your invitation. You will now pause
every dozen steps, to admire the view. Your venerable relative will
conjure up recollections of Vauxhall (and Influenza), and pass on.
Again and again will you stop, pointing out the beauties of this gas
trophy and that oil design. With tears in her eyes (caused by
chronic sneezes), your grandmother will hurriedly acquiesce in your
approbation, and try to break into a trot. Do not thwart her—by all
means let the old Lady run, but choose your own route. Having
carefully ascertained the direction of the wind, you will place your-
self (wrapped in your mackintosh) and your now shivering ancestress
in such a position so that it (the wind, not the mackintosh) blows full
in your faces as you stand by the brink of the basin devoted to the
fountains. And now comes your final test. Nine will strike, and in
a moment the water will rush into the air, assuming, under the
electric light, a number of different colours. It will, rise, I repeat,
in the air, and then descend in tons of spray upon—the head of your
unfortunate relative! But why pursue the theme further? At this
stage the story may conveniently break off. The remainder can be
divulged—at the inquest!
"TO ARMS! TO ARMS!" AT ISLINGTON.
All London last week was rushing to the Agricultural Hall to see
the Military Tournament. The audience rose like one man, and
shrieked with enthusiasm when two mounted warriors whacked one
another over the head with single-sticks in the cause of charity, and
were equally delighted when the same sort of operation was per-
formed (only on foot and with bayonet-prods in the chest) all for
the sake of our " old and disabled soldiers." The Musical Ride of
the Life Guards quite explained the gallantry exhibited by the re-
presentatives of the Cavalry Household Brigade at Kassassin; and
as for the " display " of the Hussars, nothing has been seen half so
good since the days of Astley's. The Musical Ride might be intro-
duced in Rotten Row from Twelve to One, while the Band plays.
But the performances, taken all round (and they were taken all
round—in the ring), were too long. They wanted relief—in fact, the
Circus required a Clown. No doubt, had H.R.H. the Duke of Cam-
bridge thought of it in time, with his ever-readiness to oblige he
would have entered the arena, and amid the cheers of the spectators
have given a few War Office witticisms. Perhaps next year the
Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief will act upon the hint. In the
interim he might undergo a course of "wheeze drill," under the
experienced direction of that worthy successor to Grimaldi, Mr.
Harry Payne. The Duke interrupting the Driving competition of
the Royal Artillery to ask "Number One " of the leading detach-
ment "what he should go for to fetch for to carry P" should be
"immense," and if he can only train a charger (with a table-napkin
tied round his neck) to take a cup of tea with him, the popularity
of the Tournament would be doubled. "Our Only General''
might appear as " Ringmaster," with a brilliant Staff closely follow-
ing in his footsteps, after the fashion of "the real thing" at
Sanger's. Then the Battle of Waterloo, or some other well-known
"Military and equestrian spectacle" might be revived, with the
genuine guns, soldiers, and colours, "the new and appropriate
uniforms" being "kindly lent by the Secretary of State for War—
from the Tower." But, seriously, the Military Tournament, in every
respect, was admirable, and for the future must be considered as one
of the most popular features" of the London Season. Captain
TxnxY managed everything perfectly; and as to Captain Trout, who
had to call out the names,—well—it was wonderful how his voice
lasted; at all events, though dismounted, there was no sort of doubt
asjto his being a hoarse-soldie

PICKWICKIAN SCENE IN THE UPPER HOUSE.
Lord Rosebery as the Fat Hoy becomes very wide awake, and startles the
Elderly Maiden Aunt. "I wants to make your Flesh creep!"
A HAPPY THOUGHT-READING SEANCE.
Mr. Ietixo Bisnor certainly had a success last "Wednesday night when I saw him at
the Westminster Palace Hotel,—after several failures. He was unsuccessful in finding
hidden pins—a proceeding almost as difficult as discovering the whereabouts of the pro-
verbial needle in the bottle of hay,—but he certainly did give the correct number of a
bank-note under circumstances which seemed to me to preclude all suspioion of collusion.
The Seance lasted about four hours; and I daresay it Btruck Sir Henry Holland,
Mr. Millais, Mr. Justin McCarthy, and a few other eminent gentlemen, that, as they
were not entirely idle men, it was just possible their time might have been better
employed elsewhere. However, the Premier went in for it the following night, and he and
Mr. Charles Russell and a few other great thinkers were all thinking of numbers and
setting Mr. Stuart Cumberland to tell them what numbers they had been thinking of
while the dull work of Legislation was going on upstairs.
After all, Cut bono? It is of no use for the detection of crime, as the thinker, be he a
great or little thinker, must put himself unreservedly in the hands,—literally in the hands
—of a thought-reader; and, to commence with, it is so very likely that a gentleman, who
has just hidden dynamite somewhere, would step forward and allow Mr. Cumberland, or
Mr. Bishop, to ascertain where the combustible packets were, speoially as the thought-
reader would probably be accompanied by a Detective with handcuffs for immediate use.
The Bishop Seance was hot and dry work. "Think of some imaginary pain," said
Mr. Bishop to Mr. Healy. "Sham-pain" occurred perhaps to more than one mind, but
Mr. Irving Bishop didn't offer to read their thoughts. Jortunately there was an inter-
change of confidences on this subject. We read one another's thoughts, and the finish of
that entertainment, long after Thinkers and Thought-Readers had left, wasn't by any
means the worst part of that Seance: and, to a certain extent, the result answers satis-
factorily my own question, " Cut bono t"
PLAYHOUSE AND PLATFORM.
That a prominent metropolitan figure like
Mr. Spurgeon should find himself at the fresh
and vigorous age of fifty enjoying the honours
of that elastic piece of festivity known as a
"Jubilee," can neither astonish his heteroge-
neous admirers, nor occasion serious cavil
among his less obsequious critics. He has
worked with no little energy in his day; and
the "beautiful letter" from Mr. Gladstone.
"which being private, he regretted he could
not read to the Meeting," no less than the
handsome cheque for £4,500, presented to him
on behalf of the Committee by Mr. T. W.
Olney (which he immediately distributed in
charity), testified sufficiently to the public feel-
ing that Mr. Spurgeon has had the power to
evoke. It seems almost a pity, therefore, that
in the midst of all this hearty jubilation he
should have run across that always pleasing,
but sometimes dangerously alluring person, the
ever enterprising and watchful representative
of the Pall Mall Gazette. Such, however, has
been his fate, and he has been induced to
part with some unnecessary confidences that,
for the sake of his reputation for sound sense,
he had far better have kept to himself.
Mr. Spurgeon is not wise when he begins to
talk about what he does not in the least under-
stand, and he does not in the least understand
"the Theatre." Assuring his interlocutor that
they will never "get it" from him, he went on
to inform him that his aim " was to raise men
entirely above all that, to elevate them to a
higher level, where they will not feel the want
of that kind of recreation," adding, at the
same time, the rather unfair and inconsequent
piece of information, "that he had too often
seen the trail of the Theatre across the Christian
hearth to have the slightest doubt as to whether
it is an institution that makes us righteous men
or the reverse."
What the popular preacher means by the
"trail of the Stage" he does not say, but he
furnishes rather an unpleasant idea of the
Christian hearth, for he proceeds to point out
that attendance at a Play, which may be the
highest and purest known form of intellectual
recreation, is incompatible with such Christian
life as he wots of on the hearth with which he
is familiar. This is nonsense, and it is some-
thing more. It is mischievous nonsense. It is
just this bigoted and hackneyed condemnation
of a great and noble artistic institution, by
well-meaning, but uninformed men, that has
drawn a hard and fast line between recreation
and religion, and has drawn it by no means to
the advantage of the latter.

owing to the absence of the Chief, and the
difficulty of deoiding who should, be the " cor-

the idea was abandoned, and their Lordships
proceeded to "discuss a first-rate Crown Case
