Schne-Mr. Punce's Sanctum. Mr. Punch and the Poet LAUREATE discovered in confidential confabulation.
Mr. Punch. When bard meets bard, then comes the—pipe of peace !
Poet Laureate. “I pipe but as the linnets sing,” you know,
" And do but sing”—and smoke_" because I must."
Mr. Punch. Refill, my Lord ! Could Raleigh make a third,
(Defiant here of James's Counterblast,)
The spacious times of great ELIZABETH
Might seem returned-almost.
Poet Laureate.
Well qualified !
Shall “days that deal in ana ” deal with aught
In the large-thoughted free Shakspearian style ?
Leviathan may not be aped-or judged -
By "literary leeches."
Mr. Punch.
Humph! There peeps
A glint of green from out that pocket.
Poet Laureate (flushing slightly).
Oh !
My play—my poem-say my poem-play ;
No theatre-thing, in present trim at least.
But SELBORNE likes it; you, I thought, might care
To scan-appraise —
Mr. Punch.
Mellifluous ALFRED mine,
From green to green, of cover, know I it.
Poet Laureate. And think?
Mr. Punch.
A large-schemed work wakes many thoughts,
Scarce summable in the smart young critic's phrase
Of cynical cocksureness. Stately-sweet,
High-souled, and unhysteric, like all verse
From lips that satyr-froth has never stained,
Nor Cockney spasm vulgarised.
Poet Laureate.
Such praise
From Punch's lips is present pledge of Fame.
Mr. Punch. Well buttered, both !-would sneer the Twopenny Timon ;
Eh, TOBY?

Poet Laureate.
He's no Tenant of the Tub,
No Cynosarges prompt at snap and snarl.
Mr. Punch. But has a bite in him for Humbug's heels,
Or Folly's calves. He'll not touch yours, my Lord !
Poet Laureate. “Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks.”
Mr. Punch. Talking of Beggars, what would BURNS, I wonder,
Have said to yours?
Poet Laureate.
Why, what say you ?
Mr. Punch.
BURNS painted
With more than CALLOT power of graphic coarseness
And biting humour; put his “Jolly Beggars ”
Beside your Medieval Mendicants,
My Poet, and perpend! Shakspearian grasp
Of many-coloured wide humanity,
With more than lovely faint-limned lyric shadows,
Me'lifluous-tongued abstractions, strained conceits,
And gross grotesqueries our Stage would furnish.
Poet Laureate. I fain would serve it.
Mr. Punch.
“All the World's a Stage,”
And that you 've served with sweetness many a year,
With pure un poisoned charm of such Art-honey
As you alone can hive. Your home's on Hybla,
But in Thalia's haunt you need a hand
Of practised guidance. One good turn, my Lord,
Deserves another. Book for Book! Behold!
“ That is the humour o’t," as Nym would say.
The humour ! Here you 'll find what, 'faith, you lack,
The art of midriff-moving,—Walter Map
And Margery miss your “Northern Farmer's” touch
Of true vis comica, -- will find much else
That Israfel might learn from Yorick. Take
From your friend Punch's hand Wit's beacon-light,
True Humour's fount, Humanity's map and chart,
His Gift of Gifts, his
Eighty-Seventh Volume !

JULY 5, 1884.]
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
When athletes are weary and hushed is the riot,
When launches have vanished and house-boats are gone,
When Henley once more is delightfully quiet-
'Tis soothing to muse on the Red Lion” lawn!
When the swans hold their own and the sedges scarce shiver,
As sweet summer breezes so tunefully sigh,
Let us laze at the ruddy-faced Inn by the River-
For Henley is restful in dreamy July !
LAYS OF A LAŽY MINSTREL.
HENLEY IN JULY.
OH, come down to Henley, for London is horrid;
There's no peace or quiet from sunset to dawn.
The Row is a bore, and the Park is too torrid,
So come down and lounge on the "Red Lion " Lawn !
Yes! come down to Henley, no time like the present,
The sunshine is bright, the barometer's high-
Come! come down at once, for Regatta-time's pleasant,
Thrice pleasant is Henley in laughing July!
Oh, gay are the gardens of Fawley and Phyllis,
The Bolney backwaters are shaded from heat;
The rustle of poplars on Remenham Hill is,
Mid breezes æstival, enchantingly sweet!
When hay-scented meadows with oarsmen are crowded-
Whose gay-tinted coats een bright toilettes outvie-
When sunshine is hot and the sky is unclouded,
Oh, Henley is splendid in lovely July !
Ah me! what a revel of exquisite colours,
What costumes in pink and in white and in blue,
By smart canoistes and by pretty girl-scullers,
motor
Are sported in randan, in skiff, and canoe!
T
What sun-shaded lasses we see out a-punting,
What fair gondolieri perchance we espy.
And house-boats and launches all blossom and bunting-
Oh, Henley 's a picture in merry July!
If it rains, as it may, in this climate capricious,
And Beauty is shod in the gruesome galosh ;
While each dainty head-dress and toilette delicious
Is shrouded from view in the grim mackintosh !
We'll flee to the cheery “Athena” for shelter-
The pâté is perfect, the Giesler is dry-
And think while we gaze, undismayed, at the "pelter,"
That Henley is joyous in dripping July !
The ancient grey Bridge is delightful to moon on,
For ne'er such a spot for the mooner was made;
He'll spend, to advantage, a whole afternoon on
Its footway, and loll on its quaint balustrade!
For this, of all others, the best is of places
To watch the brown rowers pull pantingly by,
To witness the splendour, the shouting, the races,
At Henley Regatta in charming July !
A VALUABLE SUGGESTION.
BRAVO, Alderman COTTON! we follow the thread of your argument
in last Saturday's Times. You have the courage of your opinions,
which shall never impair our friendship, never! But because your
Livery Companies “are not to be classed with Friendly or Bene-
volent Societies, or Monastic Institutions," are they so utterly too-
too perfect as not to need some reform somewhere? The true
Common-sense Counsel-man Mr. Punch, is the last to wish their
hospitable Turtleships abolished, and would prefer feeling ever so
"Livery," on any morning after one of your little banquets, to
seeing your Corporation reduced to a mere skeleton of picked bones.
Let the old Liveries be furbished up and improved by all means.
Let each Livery Company be reformed from within, as it should be,
n order to make City life worth Livery-ing. And here's a sug-
gestion for a commencement :- Alter the absurd old-fashioned
dinner-hour of 530 for 6, when all the Companies dine, and show
yourselves up to the modern dinner-time of day by inviting your
I guests at the reasonable hour of seven for half-past, or half-past for
eight. Next, keep the toasts, cut the speeches, and come to cigars
and coffee as quickly as possible. These will be moves in the right
direction of Progress and Municipal Reform, which Mr. Punch
hopes to see adopted forthwith. robo fi ed en

TO A PAINTED LADY.
“When powder is applied to the cheeks to the utter destruc-
tion of the complexion, it is time to speak out. Fashions
change, and a time may come when it will be fashionable to be
healthy, when normal hair will be popular and natural skin the
rage.”—Mr. MALCOLM MORRIS at the Health Exhibition.
SAY why with those horrid cosmetics and dyes
Your complexion you try to enhance,
To cause your admirers unpleasant surprise,
Every time that they happen to glance ?
The bismuth and rouge, dear, are simply a sin,
Though they add to the hairdresser's pelf;
But why do you plaster the exquisite skin,
That is fairer when left to itself ?
Go read Mister MORRIS, and learn how it's bad
To make up with such horrible things.
You'd think that a savage was certainly mad,
With his nose and his lips hung with rings.
But look at yourself, Lady mine, in the glass,
When you've put on the white and the red,
The savage in foolishness some folks surpass,
For they should have more sense in the head.
Don't darken the sockets to show up the eyes,
And so imitate wasting disease;
Don't torture the hair with vile mineral dyes,
When its natural colour will please ;
Don't powder the cheeks to look painfully pale,
Though the fashion incites to the plan;
Be sure all such artifice ever will fail
In the capture of sensible man.
Don't pad out your figure and pull in your stays,
It disgusts every person of taste,
And doctors have told us you shorten your days,
When you foolishly tighten your waist.
And, what will weigh with you much more, I suppose,
For 'tis said that pride never feels pain,
It's certain tight-lacing will redden your nose,
And the powder-puff dab it in vain.
A day may arrive when Hygeia must win,
And all natural charms be the rage,
When Fashion forbids you to whiten the skin,
And the rouging is left to the Stage.
Then, PHYLLIS, be first in this Woman's Crusade,
And so cease your complexion to mar;
Pray show us yourself, and not what Art has made,
And you 'll find you are fairer by far.

THE TOWN.
V.-THE STRAND. AMUSEMENT.
PART I.
Who'll limn the Strand P The Arts now interblend,
The pen will paint, the brush tint-music wake,
And every scribbler who a quill can mend
Must ape APELLES, and his foolscap take
As canvas for the graphic. Words can lend
No picture-spell huge Babylon will not break,
Though 'twere the sweet word-wizardry that holds
Readers of RUSKIN tranced-o'en when he scolds !
No canvas but a gallery were required
To hold the changefál pageant. Picture well
Our Town's large life? The task o'ertaxed and tired
The bustling brush of DORÉ. None may tell
Its tale, the myriad-roofed, the multi-spired,
Or word its wide extremes, its heaven and 'hell,
Far sundered as the Florentine's, yet near
As the Clown's laugh to the Tragedian's tear.
Here histrions congregate ; here mouthing mimes
And ballet-beauties thick the footway throng ;
The Star who wins his column in the Times,
The fameless hanger-on of farce and song';
The grim interpreter of classic crime,
The fair-faced renderer of romantic wrong.
What know they of still peace or placid pleasure ?
Thralls of that cruel craft the trade of pleasure.
And London's pleasure-seekers are a horde
As motley as the host whom XERXES led
To slaughter by the Greeks' victorious sword;
But if a cap-and-bell crowned every head
That in the quest is pitilessly bored,
PATCH would be king. There's no delusion bred
By crowds of which our minds need disabusing
More than the mob's conception of the Amusing.
In that above most else we're Custom's fools,
But here that truth might raise a general frown.
This is Amusement's realm ; 'tis here she rules
The idlers and the toilers of the Town;
The Shakspeare-worshipper of Culture's schools,
The incult adorer of the painted clown,
And those who find the tragical and witty
In mouthing melodrame and comic ditty.
“ The Play's the thing” to move what does it move ?
The conscience, passions, fancy, mind, or taste ?
'Twere to inquire too nicely. Saints reprove
The Stage, some brand it sin, some simply waste;
But so they ban the world. The censor's groove
Is, like the cynic's, narrow. David's haste
In condemnation is the common failing
Of those who think religion must mean railing.
If "all the world's a stage,” the Stage to-day
Itself's a little world, and here's its centre.
A world the greater World will praise, and pay,
Fondle, and pet, nay, even pine to enter.
Mimes are the mode. Mercurial Lady May,
Of big “first nights" assiduous frequenter,
“Would give her little finger, don't you know,
Just to play Juliet coram populo."
So swears DE FLITTERS, tattler to the town,-
And who in such nice matters doubts DE FLITTERS ?
His own Malvolio the house brought down,-
Lady May's "house"! Uncomplimentary titters
Greeted him, truly, in 'Twixt Axe and Crown,
Played “ for a Charity.” Art has its bitters,
And destiny will sometimes prove ironic
With amateurs e'en of the histrionic.
By, from my Lady May's own private stage
To stuffy schoolrooms of dissenting chapels,
This mimicry of mimes is all the rage.
The Player now with fame and fortune grapples
On equal terms with Poet, Painter, Sage,
At public dinners o'er the piled pine-apples
Each small “creator" of a minor part
May gush grandiloquently of his “Art”!
The word is Cant's last shibboleth. 'Tis pity
When lips most eloquent are slaves to Cant;
When Statesman proud, and Scholar wise and witty
Subdue their souls to fustian froth and rant.
Hear Premiers perorating in the City!
Hear footlight vanity, self-ministrant,
Twaddling of love and lucre, art and charity,
And you may weigh the curse of popularity !
Yes; praise is sweet, but public adulation,
The epidemic slaver of the crowd,
Debilitates ; 'twere sheer humiliation
_To spirits truly strong and nobly proud
To snuff the incense of mob-obfuscation;
Yet Players in the intoxicating cloud
Breathe on as though asphyxia were a joke.
'Tis really marvellous they do not choke !
Stars of the Strand who once had been tabooed,
Despite of brain or beauty, farther West,
That West now worships you! Capricious, crude
Is Fashion's fulsome patronage, at best.
Hysteria rules the hour, and Art, subdued
To gush and pose, perpetuates the pest.
Sad when the best of these who “live to please"
Talk Pecksniffism blent with Barnumese!
Stars still, of steady light, save when obscured
By maudlin mists that manly sense should scatter.
Stage-haunted Strand, the motley myriads lured
To nightly pleasure 'midst thy crush and clatter,
Not all are lads to cynic lust inured,
Or fribbles caught by puns and vulgar patter.
Glory and gain yet greet the bold experiment
Of moving interest and manly merriment.
The Play's the thing—as BELFORT treats the play-
To draw the eager Town, yet not degrade it.
The histrionic idol of the day
Not only prosed of “SHAKSPEARE's Art,” he played it.
But RAHAB, semi-veiled, seductive, gay,
Who sets off sin by knowing how to shade it, -
She and her panders, in fierce greed of profit,
Still makes the Stage a vestibule of Tophet.
Her spell is o'er the Strand, within, without,
Footlights and footway feel her subtle taint.
No need to view the pleasure-chasing rout
With the sour visage of a self-dubbed Saint;
But tolerant sense, not prone to whine or flout,
May question whether patchouli and paint,
Or brainless beauty basest lures abusing,
Are needful elements of the Amusing.
May doubt if coarse sensation, fun as coarse,
Though fatuously flaunted, fit the Stage
To rest, and recreate, and reinforce
The fretted toilers of a feverish age.
And pleasure's spring, so poisoned at its source,
Spreads deep corruption difficult to gauge,
Which yet the observant eye may understand,
Watching the hurrying life-stream of the Strand.
Here high-born folly courts its dismal doom.
Noblesse oblige ? Young slips of rank who ape
A Jehu's fame, the fashions of a groom,
Meet Nemesis in rouged and padded shape.
A tale whose course is farce, its finis gloom,
When tragic weeds the tawdry spangles drape,
Is that of many a thrice-gulled golden youth.
A Tale of Town! Hear, and attest its truth.

THE TOWN.
No. V.-THE STRAND. AMUSEMENT.
PART II.
NOBLESSE oblige! And young Lord PIMPERNEL
Was very noble. Heir to an old race
And many-centuried title, tutored well
In each nobiliary art and grace,
F PURSUIT OF
PLEASURE
He bore the impress of “a regular swell" ;
Or so Miss GLITTERS of the childish face
Assured her friends, in that fine free vernacular
In which “the Baby” could be so oracular.
Eton and Oxford knew him, and he knew
As much of what at Oxford and at Eton
Is taught as is absorbed like air or dew.
“Sapping " the young Olympian was not “sweet on,"
But while he stroked his College-boat, the crew
PIMPERNEL boasted, had not once been beaten,
And such a record surely should be plenty
For any young “ Barbarian"-at twenty.
If thews gave manhood, PIMPERNEL, indeed,
Had been a man of men. Alas! virility
Comes neither from athletics nor from breed.
Yet he'd ambition to display ability
Beyond the cinder-path or cricket-mead,
In something more than vigour or agility,
And so, with generous ardour, joined the band
Of neophytes whose shrines adorn the Strand.
A curious cultus, with a creed as strange
Could it be formulated. The belief
In self and sensual stir has no wide range,
And those beatitudes of which the chief
Is Ballet-beauty furnish little change
Of rapturous enticement; dull as brief
The joys our Pimpernels must chase and treasure,
Because, forsooth, they're “Life," and therefore Pleasure"!
How picture Pleasure? It is deftly done
By painters of the florid school of ETTY ;
A luscious nymph with eyes half love, half fun,
Free breasts, and flying hair of radiance jetty,
In whose bright track bewildered myriads run:
All which on canvas looks complete and pretty,
But 'tis not much of life's amazing story
That can be compassed in an allegory.
Great EPICURUS, could you pace the Strand,
And penetrate its darker penetralia,
You'd scarcely find your doctrine sagely bland
Regarded in these silly Saturnalia.
Lord PIMPERNEL had blood, he would have land,
And yet to be on terms with “Miss IDALIA"-
Her name was JENNY GLITTERS-he'd turn dangler
Upon that youthful but experienced angler.
An“Extra in the Ballet,” speech-debarred,
With scarce a step to foot! A face-well, scan it;
You'll find the harpy lines astute and hard
Beneath the baby-mask, graven as in granite.
PIMPERNEL saw her silken-hosed and starred,
His senses fired, and she knew how to fan it,
This sudden tinder-flame of boyish passion.
Phrenzy is hard to cure when 'tis the fashion !
To take his place, fool-envied, at her side, -
Canaille to the finger-tips, coarse, giftless, -
Stirred the mad boy's blue blood with greater pride
Than his long pedigree. With freedom thriftless
He lavished gifts upon her, nought denied
That greed astute could grasp; he'd have it riftless,
The lute of her delight; he might have said so,
But that all metaphor confused his head so.
How far vain-glorious pride at being first
In the mad race fashion's late whim has started
Inspired the purblind passion, pander-nurst,
For a mere cockney siren, callous-hearted,
'Twere hard to measure. Little lordlings thirst
For vulgar fame by coarse success imparted;
And, probably, of footlight-fired insanity,
If one-third's passion, two at least are vanity.
At Amaranth Towers all was stir and glow;
The heir's majority was close at hand.
The Duke's delight, if coldly comme-il-faut,
Was deep-as his respect for blood and land;
And land and blood love stalwart heirs, you know;
An Amaranth with physique so simply grand
Had not appeared for many a generation.
What wonder all was joy and jubilation ?
And then-and then there came the palsying news:
The heir was wedded! Lady PIMPERNEL,
Née JENNY GLITTERS, owned the Titan thews
And shallow soul of the Strand-haunting Swell.
Owned them. E'en land and blood may not refuse
Law-hallowed bonds to bear, if fastened well.
When extra-legal “honour" is sole tether
It is a different matter altogether.
Then sires may scheme, and mothers may finesse,
And sons who've played the fool may be persuaded
To play the cad as well, and so redress
The moral balance. Family pride, if shaded
From public scorn, may unctuously bless
The chance of private meanness, less degraded,
As it conceives, by any secret scurviness
Than open show of social topsiturviness.
But here was no such hope. The Amaranth strain
Was muddied past all mending. Clubmen mocked;
They know the Idalian history, which 'twere vain
To tell the dupe. Society was shocked,
Not all unpleasantly, 'Tis ever gain
To have the scandal-market freshly stocked:
Without due sequence of distinguished sinners
Dulness would reign supreme at balls and dinners,
The affair was “quite dramatic,”—80 soft lips
Impressively declared. At Amaranth Towers
Expectant gladness suffered chill eclipse.
Ah! better cypress than the orange flowers
Sometimes, sometimes! Pride lashed by scorpion whips,
And love that sheds hot tears in secret showers
Are vastly telling in a stage ideal,
But claim a mute respect when all too real.
A stage ideal ? The ideal Stage
Is yet more mythical. The crazy fancies
Of current fashion, fads of foolish age,..
And lunes of crackbrained youth, which spies romances
In footlight posturings, all the unwholesome rage
For mimic mumming's mad extravagances,
Are growths of vanity debased and prurient,
Jay-like conceit as silly as esurient.
This lured poor PIMPERNEL to such a fate
As fancy sickens at. Racecourse and Row
Behold “My Lady” in the swaggering state
Of the proud parvenu, hard eyes aglow
With restless triumph. Something less elate
The heir of Amaranth! Brainless boys who go
To the sham Eden of the Stage for Eves
Find not the Serpent only now deceives.
The world behind the footlights is a world
Society's prying presence should eschew;
Fashion's fine dames and Swelldom's darlings curled
Within its privacies have no more to do
Than in a clerk's back parlour. Furred and pearled
By sensual wealth, the Idalian harpy-crew
Degrade the Stage, make it, accursed twice,
Pander to Vanity and nurse of Vice.

pestiferous, and though the odds are thus five to one that such fearful
description does not apply to our own particular domicile, what sane
man, as the Professor loudly demanded, would like to continue in
doubt on this vital point? Besides, as he explained, the test is so
easily applied. All you have to do is to run up a ladder to the top of
your house, with a can of hot water in your right hand, a bottle of
oil of peppermint in your left, and a bag of disinfecting powder in
your teeth, walk along the parapet, and pour the peppermint and
hot water down the soil-pipe. Then go into every room in the house,
and sniff powerfully, and where you discover the smell of pepper-
mint, there will the leakage be. What can be simpler ? "But, if
from certain circumstances of age or figure, it might be thought
desirable to seek a substitute for this slight feat of athletics, the
Professor would supply the name of a young and active Sanitarian
who would undertake the duty for the trifling charge of two guineas.
This was of course a mere preliminary matter, to be followed by
the taking up of every floor in the house, in order to remove the
accumulated dust of years, London dust being one of the deadliest
poisons known. It would then be necessary, in order to perfect the
ventilation, to have in every room a pipe communicating with the
external atmosphere, taking especial care to have one in connection
with the foot of every bedstead, and then the Professor wound up his
highly instructive but most appalling lecture, by an impassioned
appeal to his hearers to carry out implicitly every hint he had given
them, for, as he said, things were so awfully bad in these respects, in
this terrible Metropolis of ours, that the only way to be quite secure
from the effects of bad sewerage, was to live in a Balloon, anchored in
mid-air! The audience departed, looking anxious and perplexed, and
I sought my hitherto comfortable couch with the feeling that know-

determined at once to carry out to the letter the kind Professor's
advice; so, to begin with, I slept, or at any rate tried to sleep, with
the windows wide open, and, strange to say, by some singular and
perfectly unaccountable circumstance, got up with a very severe cold.
I, of course, sent immediately for the active Sanitarian, who, I am
sorry to say, pronounced my apparently comfortable dwelling to be
in so fearful a condition that it would require a thorough survey by
a practical Professor ; but as that would render necessary a some-
what prolonged absence on my part, which, I regret to say, would be
inconvenient to me at this particular time of the year, I have ad-
journed it for the present. In the meantime I have had all the carpets
taken up and cut smaller, and the uncovered portions of the floors
painted and varnished ; and though possibly it may be found to be an
improvement when the deadly smells of the paint and the varnish and
the peppermint have quite gone off, at present it is scarcely endurable,
and all my friends shrink from my formerly comfortable home as if
it were infected with the plague.

MR. PUNCH.
(Or what we should like to see given as his

MY DEAR MR. PUNCH, You are always
complaining about the state of Covent Gar-

have been at it for some years. Other jour-
nals have attacked the subject from time to
time, but you, whether by pen or pencil, have
never ceased to hold up Covent Garden Mar-
ket, called by you Mud-Salad Market-a
name which, like the mud itself, will stick-
to public opprobrium as an abominable nuis-

you have come down on me-"poor little
Me'-as the person who could set every-
thing right in Mud-Salad Market.
Can I? That is just the question.
Wouldn't I do it if I could? There's
the point. I am able to offer all my rights
for sale, but what are my rights? If there

First, as to the Play. When I was about fifteen I saw it per-

grace, and was so impressed by the comic portion of it as given by
KEELEY as Sir Andrew, the prototype of Bob Acres, and Mrs. KEELEY

extraordinary passion for this second-class Illyrian potentate, and the
wound not proving mortal, all might end happily.
The only chance for this play is for the comic personages to be
played by the most popular low comedians, at whom the Public are
prepared to laugh directly they appear. Now, as Manager TOOLE
could not be obtained, PAULTON as Sir Andrew, W. HILL as Sir Toby,
and Mrs. BANCROFT as Maria, might have made it what it ought to
have been. “But that's all one, the Play is done ;” and so now I
must tell you what you are dying to know-something about Malvolio
and Viola.
Place aux Dames! Miss ELLEN TERRY is simply charming as
Viola, and in a few nights-i.e., by the time this letter to you sees
the light-she will have got over her first nervousness, and will play
that first scene less seriously, remembering that 'tis all a Twelfth
Night Masque, nothing more, and that the dramatist never meant us
to examine too cariously into the motives of action in this Comedy.
Not that the apology would save the unfortunate JONES from
severe condemnation had he written such a play nowadays. The
spice of burlesque strut, which I have seen the other ELLEN, over
the way, Miss NELLIE FARREN, do to perfection as a Masher Prince
(with a song of the “I'm all there!” kind), and which Miss ELLEN

That silent cannon holds tremendous forces,
As yet untested because unprovoked,
Which to restrain would tax the best resources
Of patient wit with prudent vigonr yoked.
But haughty pride plus fatuous futility
Are ineffective substitutes indeed,
Unworthy of all masculine Nobility
Of British breed.
Noblesse oblige! But not to bumptious folly
Or tricky sophistry, or scheme inept.
That gun, if once its silent charge forth volley,
Will not be stayed or from full action kept
By muzzle-blocking coronet. A queer age ?
Perhaps, and demagogy is a pest:
But 'tis not that will write upon the Peerage

“NOBLESSE OBLIGE!”
NOBLESSE oblige! To read that obligation
Demands some little wisdom, good my Lords ;
Of which the act that here finds illustration
But insufficient evidence affords.
Wisdom, hereditary wisdom, verily,
Is your proud boast; but at the haughty claim
The Mentors of the Mób are mocking merrily,–
And whose the blame ?
Not at the mouth of this particular cannon
The bubble reputation should be sought.
You plume yourself this puerile poor plan on ?
Well, there's a biggish battle to be fought.
Beware of entrance in that quarrel headily,
Or only pantomimically armed !
By “properties” your foe will not be readily
Checked or alarmed.
Foolish! You might as well oppose artillery
With popguns, or a battery confront
With serried lines of cork-propelling Sillery,
As of that battle think to bear the brunt
With mere insignia however splendid.
Time-honoured privilege too bold and brisk
May find superfluous parade attended
With needless risk.
“Be bold-be bold-be not too bold !” The adage
Might give “our old nobility” a hint.
Ours—in your view-is a subversive mad age,
And doctrines strange appear in speech and print.
Defiance rash means but acceleration
Of the inevitable, footing slow;
There's little “noble" in the infatuation
That courts the blow.

that the Chinese Commissioner “had been good enough
to arrange for the supply of tea to the visitors in the
Restaurant." This display of generosity on the part of
the Imperial Government of Pekin must have kindled
a spirit of charitable emulation in the breasts of other
assisters in the show, for the circular informed us that
“many of the exhibitors of articles of food had kindly
consented to supply the same free of charge." And well
was the promise kept. It certainly was no fault of many
of those "kind” exhibitors if any of the visitors left the
building without consuming an unlimited quantity of
tea, soup, chocolate drops, sugared almonds, (hot from
the machine), essence of beef, American drinks, mustard,
aërated waters, strawberries, furniture polish, ginger
beer, plate-powder, and a foreign liquor, which, I was
informed just in time, tasted like very beautiful black
draught. But of course the consumption of these tooth-
some articles of food was merely a detail in the evening's
entertainment.
The duties of the reception (which commenced at half-
past eight) were shared by His Grace and Sir FREDERICK.
In a recess near these two distinguished Chairmen were
the Band of the German Cuirassiers. It was obvious,
after a visit to the grounds, why these talented Teutonic
warriors had been placed far away from the giddy
throng in the Gardens. The two kiosks were occupied
by our own Grenadiers and the First Regiment of the
French Engineers, who played away under two mag-
nificent “gas devices,"containing the arms of the
neighbouring countries to which they (the bandsmen)
respectively belonged. Had the Germans been allowed
to stray away to their old quarters in the Eastern Kiosk,
they would have come in contact with their Gallic foes,
and a premature and unrehearsed representation of la
revanche might possibly have been the result. So the
Duke and the Doctor of Civil Law kept the Cuirassiers
close beside them, so to speak, under their eyes, and a
possibly unpleasant incident was prevented. No doubt
his Grace, with ready tact, had persuaded the Germans
that, in their white flannels and top-boots, “they looked
quite cool and summery," and "served as an excellent
substitute for a trophy of block ice.” Be this as it may,

Lady Circe. “WELL-YOU CAN TAKE THAT NICE OLD LADY DOWN TO SUPPER, YOU KNOW-AND THEN I CAN HAVE HER CHAIR!"
No CURTIUS-leap is this but mutton-madness
Which patriot sense must contemplate with sadness.
So fine a tlock, so richly fleeced and plump!
Beware, Bell-wether! Friendly hints you're spurning,
For from that gulf profound there's no returning,
If once you make the rash and fatal jump.
“FOLLOW MY LEADER!”
WATHER, O rash Bell-wether, would you urge
Your sheepish flock, true brebis de Panurge ?
Dingdong, the Rabelaisian mutton-monger,
Was not more struck with sorrowful surprise,
Than is JOHN BULL, the stout and soundly wise,
At your strange exhibition of death-hunger.
The fabled flock-leader of scanty wit
Who, to save life, would leap into a pit,
Had courage of your curious complexion.
You need not go so far as ARISTOTLE,
Nor to the Oracle of the Holy Bottle
To see the application or connection.
The flock you lead may comfortably still
Browse on the heights, if but wrong-headed will
Lead them into no new and needless peril;
But if you call attention to their right
To special pasture, some may deem it slight;
And possibly that thought may not prove sterile.
That other herd, which, fired most fiendishly,
Dashed down a steep place sheer into the sea
You surely will not take as an example ;
For they were mad! A leader is but vanity
If there be serious doubts about his sanity:
Of yours this seems a questionable sample.
Follow my Leader is a pretty game,
But followers may boggle, all the same,
At desperate leaps if taken in the dark.
Some of your followers seem a trifle slack,
And just a little tempted to hold back,
A tendency which it were well to mark.

certain if our old friend Barlow went out on a bicycle with Tommy

"188,
THE TOWN.
No. VII.-LORD's.
SPORT! What commingling visions at the word
Crowd on the fancy! Nimrod, Mr. Briggs,
Chaldean, Cockney,
tragical, absurd,
Broad Tory No-
bles, proud patri-
cian Whigs,
The smug M.P.

The bronze-faced

From tiger-hunt-
ing to the tennis-
court,
How various are
thy votaries,
mighty Sport!
A Libyan lion-
chace would
somewhat flutter
The country gen-
tlemen who read
the Field;
But though these days be branded “bread-and-butter,”
The sporting instinct reigns, it does not yield
To later cults of the Intense and Utter.
Shrill Anti-Vivisectionists have appealed,
S.P.C.A.'s have preached and prayed in vain,
Sport still rules strong in the stout Saxon strain.
But here the fetish of our race assumes
Its fairest and least fevered shape. This sward
Has witnessed many a fight, but fallen plumes,
Blood-stained- of knights or pigeong-have not marred
Fond memories of its verdure; love illumes,
Cool courage consecrates them, and the bard
May well be snared in sentiment's close thicket,
Who'd critic play whilst English youth plays cricket.
Oh, enviable, in the heat of June,
Free-limbed and flannel-vestured! GORDON GREGG,
Eton's proud boast, found fame at plenilune,
The hero of that mighty swipe to leg!
Who such high claim to worship dared impugn?
Premiers for such applause might vainly beg.
To rouse the ring and ravish the Pavilion
Is sweeter than the service of the Million.
Half London, in light blue, it seemed, had swarmed
_To watch his swelling score. Correct and cool
He cut and drove, whilst ancient dry-bobs warmed
To yelling youth again, and all the School
With thunderous acclaim the welkin stormed,
And even the lisping fashionable fool
Forgot his affectation and his “weed,"
In boyish shouts of “Played, Sir! Played indeed!."
The Ladies, like a shattered rainbow ringing
The spacious oval, half oblivious grew
Of dress-display and dainty villade-flinging ;
Sir PERCY SLOPE, the adipose Old Blue,
Forgot the coming" feed," till by the upspringing
Of ball in air the breathless thousands knew
“ Old GREGG's grand innings, Sir!” at last was o'er,
Adding a hundred odd to Eton's score.
Oh, then came shouts and shouldering, and then
Hundreds of hungry heroes fed like one;
And fair-faced flowers of the Upper Ten
Found chaff, champagne, and chicken such good fun,
And that huge round became a splendid pen
For Epicurus-porkers; boyhood's bun
And ginger-beer, dear to a simpler race,
To Pommery and pigeon-pie gave place.
So Britain's sons, we boast, are nurtured, so
Her battles won,-and so Society gains
A fete day and al fresco feast! The glow
In smooth round cheeks is not all health, youth drains
The sparkling beaker, and the boyish beau
Learns here how muscle lords it over brains,
And how a stripling Fashion's eyes can fix
Who, giftless else, can slog a ball for six.
Important lessons! GORDON GREGG was quick
To spy their bearings, though the youth indeed,
When not before the wicket, seemed a “ stick,"
Some might have said a clown, but that his breed
Forbade the imputation. Though the pick
Of Town's athletic swelldom may succeed
In winning cheers and cups as sporting Titans,
They are not always Admirable Crichtons.
Though GREGG “compiled” so many “centuries,"
And at the swiftest shooters would not blench,
He has not lived to witch his country's eyes,
Or to adorn its Senate, Bar, or Bench.
Not even stalwart manhood's simpler prize
Has he attained in camp, or charge, or trench.
He's no more soldier than he's senior wrangler,
But that unvirile vaurien a Town-dangler.
LORD's knows him yet, a lounger Alushed of face,
Valiant at luncheon-hour, and prompt to tell
Bis ancient scores again. To “swipe” or “place"
Is his no more, but the blue-cinctured belle
He bores with copious comment; she, blonde GRACE,
“Wishes the stupid game were not so swell."
Or that they'd leave her, sunshade-screened, to toy
With sugared strawberries and Lord BEAUFOY.
GREGG poses as old hero, but, alack !
The sheeny-hatted, snowy-collared toff,
With taste for toffee still, has caught the knack
Of cool irreverence, and is apt to scoff
At antique claims; Bo GREGG, the Cambridge crack,
The Eton Star, fails somehow to “ come off”
Either with girls, whom he is apt to bore,
Or boys, against whose “cheek” he cannot “score."
GREGG, in sad seriousness, though stalwart still,
Is “ tubby" now, and something of a butt
To those he plagues with memories of past skill
At forward play, at leg-hit, drive, or cut.
A witless chatterer, roseate of gill,
With stiffly-waxed moustache and swelling strut,
He scarcely seems to set the final chrism
On the great gospel of Athleticism.
Contemn not muscle! In a ruling race
Strong sinew, steady nerve, and patient pluck
May not be shelved for genius, wit, and grace;
'Twixt wickets, or in war, these might" get stuck,”
As GREGG would say, for want of stay or pace.
Genius is but an Ariel, Wit a Puck,
Apart from Manhood, power undefined,
But born as much of Muscle as of Mind.
Only hysteric, headlong, modish gush
All spheres invades. Not honest love or zeal
Moves the full-feeding fashionable crush.
Society's sham-enthusiasms steal
The freshness e'en from youth; a painted blush
Is scarce more false than fulsome dames who feel
Boredom's full burden 'midst the greed and noise
Which now attend the Battle of the Boys.
Gregarious hero-worship, blind, half-hollow,
Makes of a GREGG the fetish of his day.
Platonic nous, the brightness of Apollo,
Would serve him less than skill to “hit” and “play,"
In winning plaudits from the crowds who follow
Fashion's forefinger; but that Goddess gay
Is fickle in her smiles, and will not warm
To Milo's self, when old, or “out of form."
The Muscle-cultus, forced into a'fever,
Or fondled into a mere social fad,
Of British Youth may prove the arch-deceiver.
Tall scoring will not save the callow lad
From feebly foolish manhood; the achiever
Of mighty swipes may prove a clown or cad.
Grim morals GORDON GREGG's career affords,
And worthy pondering, e'en at sunny LORD's!

We hear with pleasure that Mr. JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL is all
right and about again. Everybody will be glad to hail him, Lo!
well! And long may he keep so.
A PLAYER Who sprained his wrist at Lawn Tennis explained that
"he had been trying a regular wrenchaw, and did it effectually."
What is the fruit of the Irish Orange Tree ? Alas! Blood Oranges.

that they are quite like Chinese. They even try to cut their
dinner-rolls with chopsticks, and to speak to the natives in “ Pigeon-

Šoups-Birds' Nest and Fish Maw à la Tortue.-To give a
thorough Chinese flavour to these liquids (which did you not know
that they were Chinese you would take for rather watery consommé,
and rather thick mock-turtle), the Chinamen show you that they can
be consumed with the assistance of a silver punch-ladle. They (the

O'er stones a child's
small stride might
safely bridge,
In the green land a slender silvery rift !
Anon 'twixt mimic banks, than harvest ridge
Scarce higher, down its tiny torrents drift,
Buzzed o'er by darting dragon-fly and midge;
Then townward broadens, spreading clear and cool
To reedy flat and minnow-haunted pool.
Lock after lock it nears yet leafy bounds
Of the leaf-blighting City; o'er its spread
Echo swart Labour's shrill and strident sounds;
Unwonted garbage fouls its pebbly bed.
Grey mist with the grey sky its flood confounds,
It flows by banks decayed and verdure dead,
Charm-robbed, unclean, but use-endowed and large,
Laden with snorting tug and sooty barge.
It threads the Town's broad bridges, laves the walls
Of mart and senate, wharf and palace fair.
Where swallows twittered clamorous commerce calls
Harsh-voiced across its stream ; its banks upbear
The belching chimney, noisome smoke-reek falls
Like a black blight athwart its windings, where
Its sinuous creeks creep on through mud and slime
To haunts of misery and to dens of crime.
It'lips the reeking rookeries where dwell
The slaves of dirt and drudgery; where it creeps
Drift hideous helpless burdens known too well
To Law's night ministrants. So on it sweeps
Mast-forrested, a stream of strange weird spell
And mighty memories, to the briny deeps,
Its wide flood losing in the sea at last
All taint by the huge city's foulness cast.
But London's Thames is Trade's. Not Fashion's leisure
Flaunts on its flood; no Ranelagh now invites
Wigged and brocaded devotees of pleasure,
Its stream no brick-mewed citizen delights.
Its sombre bosom bears unbounded treasure
In swart uncomely bulk ; its days and nights
Are toil and traffic ; pageantry and sport
Are driven to Henley and to Hampton Court.
Trade's ditch and Folly's cesspool! “Tamise ripe,”
The Poet's pride and once the townsman's joy,
To such complexion art thou come! MCGRIPE
Is Trade's stern minion, stooping not to toy
With foolish dreams that fit the pastoral pipe;
And he has known the River, man and boy,
These fifty years, and all those years has done
His best to make it foul as Acheron !
A model citizen! 'Tis London's fate,
Sole amongst cities, in these sordid days,
To harbour such, to whom her charm, her state,
Her health's fair fame, the sweetness of her ways,
Are things indifferent. Gold alone is great,
Beauty a foolish dream that does not pay!
How should an Alderman McGRIPE afford
The civio pride contemned by prince and lord ?
Mighty is Dirt! Though taste may pale and puke,
Muck rules the roast. Doth it not help to pile
The well-erammed coffers of a callous Duke ?
And may not simple Trade afford to smile
At health's appeal or sentiment's rebuke ?
Wits may deride, reformers may revile,
Sense does not shake, and satire fails to hurt
Titled or trading traffickers in Dirt!
What though McGRIPE's huge factory vomit daily
Filth to the stream, asphyxia on the air !
Though light and verdure breathe a hopeless Vale!
Let the fouled flood its fetid burden bear,
Strength fail, sense sicken, pleasure vanish! Gaily
MCGRIPE tots up his gains. Why should he care ?
He takes no Pauline pride-alas! the pity!
In being citizen of no mean city.
He sees gold-freighted vessels homeward towed,
Tea-laden clippers, hulks with fodder piled ;
The lumbering barge-string with its sooty load ;
All, all mean wealth, and wealth on him has smiled.
When the low westering sun has flamed and glowed
Like molten bullion o'er the many-piled
Wind-rippled reaches, train-conveyed he flies
To peace and pleasantness at Brixton Rise.
Or at far Cookham finds he sweeter air,
Cheerier companionship. The plashy beat
Of measured oars, fond eyes and tresses fair
Make the long summer evenings gaily fleet.
For Wealth can leave the Shop's dull cark and care,
The masted Pool, the dingy long-shore street,
The hammer's clink, the tug's aggressive grunt,
For quiet and fair ease in skiff and punt.
Not so his scant-paid toilers. They abide
In slums that hug the sewage-cumbered river,
Or where hard by its stained and sluggish tide
Spread marshy flats o'er which coarse grass-spears shiver.
There ague, fever, foulness-bred reside,
Poverty's constant guests. Who shall deliver
These from the stream-born spectres chill and pale,
When civic pride and wit official fail ?
Foul Cloacina's haunt! Ideal fine
For the great Town's great river! Bloated Boards
That perorate and spend, discuss and dine,
The taste of tradesmen and the sense of Lords
Your congregated councils may combine;
Yet the result but scanty hope affords.
Not from the conflicts of Circumlocution
Will Town attain a cure for Thames-pollution.
M'GRIPE 's a Member; Board-room and Committee
Know his big voice and broadening waistcoat well.
As an authority upon the City,
Its wants and wishes, who may bear the bell
From the bluff Alderman ? and who more witty
On a “stray dog-corpse” or “fortuitous smell”?
And still Thames sickens, still offends the sight,
A Styx by day, a Phlegethon at night.
Night, when the broad flood blackens, lamp-starred, thronged
With ghostly shadows, when the bridges bear
Lost feet of men accurst and women wronged ;
When from the City gleams the auroral glare
Of Pleasure, motley-garbed and siren-songed;
And when in many a dark riparian lair
Mute murder lurks, and strikes its silent blow,
Freighting with death the River's sullen flow.'
A stream of pleasure ? Nay, of toil and grime,
Swift-garnered opulence and traffic dense,
Its Senate's towers, whence sound the solemn chime,
Its broad embankments, grandly strike the sense;
But beauty, brightness ? Far from Shadwell's slime
And Lambeth's lurid reek they're driven hence,
Where Pandemonium's foul mephitic censer
Scents the “sweet Thames" once sung by gentle SPENSER.

In limpid verse;

thousands, and a
Bland MELIBÆUS, whose æsthetic eye
A soot-flake shocks, bans the grey city's waste,
Its sunless yards and shrieking enginery.
The locomotive's unreposeful haste,
The sordid street, the smoke be-clouded sky,
All from which RUSKIN-by fierce words—would free us,
Is evil unredeemed to MELIBEUS.
Was it the hand of Nature, or of Man
Made metal noisy and made carbon black ?
May we hark back to the Arcadian plan,
The lumbering wain and the deep-rutted track ?
Although he vaunts his tastes Virgilian,
And finds such music in the mill-wheel's clack,
Sleek MELIBEUS lingers in Park Lane,
Dines at his Club, and travels home by train !
Meanwhile the myriad thralls of sooty toil,
Mechanic myrmidons in ant-like throngs,
Sweat to subserve his needs. Foul forges spoil
The human hive as theme for urban songs.
The flaming cauldron and the glowing coal,
_The noise, the noisomeness, all that belongs
To Manufacture in the mighty city
Moves MELIBUS to contemptuous pity.
Pity ? Let MELIBEUS come and learn
Broader compassion than the sniffling woe
Of dilettanti ; see, how drudges earn
Their starveling pittance. Chilled by winter's snow,
From dull and distant rookeries out they turn,
Hours ere the London dawn's first sickly glow
Touches the sky, while drowsing still on down,
Snug lie the moneyed thousands of the Town.
See them throng in! The bell's sonorous clang,
Toil's tocsin, quickens laggard steps. The stout
Look sombre; some whom fell disease's fang
Has marked may stagger midst the hurrying rout,
But Hunger hides the sharp rheumatic pang;
The lean-jawed labourer who has long been "out"
Crawling from yard to yard in search of work,
For some sharp twinges will not shrink or shirk.
Keen eyes are on him. Pugson's solemn frown
And sharp rebuke would scathe him did he take
Too long an easy." Pugson, churl and clown,
Has power to make stout Britons cringe and quake.
A man of wide if dubious renown,
Of still vindictiveness which he will slake
In a poor wretch's ruin, and smile on
The unmoved managerial paragon.
Such his employers deem him. They indeed
Are souls superior, of too high a flight
Aught but the gross result of toil to heed,
The individual toiler 's far too slight
A matter for their thought. Old MATTOCK's meed
Is his apportioned wage; this cancels quite
The only claim his steadiest service offers,
Which is not on their conscience but their coffers.
MATTOCK has served them fifty years or so,
A faithful drudge, his ageing limbs exposed
To Summer's heat, to Winter's wet and cold;
Now his half century of use is closed,
His cramp-racked limbs at length are weak and slow.
O'er his last task the old man lagged and dozed,
Espied by Pugson. Labour's field is large,
And MATTOCK's fate is—summary discharge !
Why not? Must economic law give place
TO MATTOCK's special need ? Forbid it, Sage!
The work-worn clod has run his weary race,
Has spent his manhood's strength for scanty wage.
Cold Trade ignores the soft superfluous"grace
Of sympathy for broken health or age.
What lies before its grey toil-shattered slave ?
Poverty's dole, the Workhouse and the Grave.
Such long-drawn labour swells the gathering gain
Which makes his masters pillars of the Trade,
Town notables, whose skill and force of brain
Wake platform panegyrics. Scribes upbraid
The banded Craftsmen who, their strength made plain,
Stretch it till Capital shrinks, sore afraid :
Labour unphalanxed at their feet must cower
Whose tyranny taught it the abuse of power.
'Neath Pugson's sway intelligence is chilled
And independence crushed; no human grace
Lightens subjection, labour's laugh is stilled,
And skill unslavish wears a sullen face.
Like some dull creek by sluggish waters filled
And emptied tide by tide, the grim grey place
At morn and night whilst garish gaslights gleam,
Absorbs and voids a joyless human stream.
Not all are Pussons truly, and not all
Labour's great Captains churls austere and mean ;
But Labour knows how oft the toiling thrall
Is slave to Greed, that wolf though gorged still lean,
And still voracious! Enterprise they call
The hungry thing that has the art to glean
From herded harried thousands tithe and toll,
Squeezed from starved body and from stunted soul.
A feature of the Town which fribbles miss
And optimists ignore. More pleasant far
For Statesmen in postprandial eulogies
Of the mechanic Arts, the conquering car
Of Science, and the bullion-dowered bliss
Of British Enterprise, to hymn the star
Ascendant of the "Happy Engineer,"
Dimmed only by Trades' Unions, Strikes, and Beer!
Meannessi! Society's canker, clinging curse
Of civilisation! Thee the cleric lash
Assails not. Does the pulpit dare asperse
The cold close-fisted devotee of cash
Who steals not, cheats not, ventures nothing worse
Than the sharp selfish “ thrift" which does not clash
With any Christian grace,-save now and then
With that vague virtue called “Goodwill to Men”?
Goodwill! Ah, MELIBEUS, chide no more
Town's fuming factories, fated birth of time!
Denounce cold hearts, brand the illiberal boor,
Show niggard greed an extra-legal crime.
Goodwill may help the City's toiling poor,
Who still must live and work midst smoke and grime,
Not, like sham Watteau shepherds, pipe and loll
With knotted sleeves against a grassy knoll !

THE Healtheries has a literature of its own. We have received
quite a library of Works on Health from the South Kensington Show.
The latest is a scientific work by “The Brothers BLOBBS," entitled
Farmer Somebody's Visit to the Healtheries (we've forgotten the
exact name, as some unprincipled person has walked off with our
copy), with an account of all he saw, eat, and drank there. It strikes
us that we have heard of “BLOBBS" before, in What-you-may-
Corlett's Sporting and Sportive Journal, but we were not aware
that he had a brother in the same line of literature. This volume
is one of which the entire BLOBBS Family might well be proud.
Having brought out this stupendous work, we should strongly advise
the BLOBBS Brothers to rest on their laurels, or in their laurels, or
under their laurels,-in fact, wherever they may happen to find
themselves and their laurels. The Farmer's notion of entering the
Healtheries is very funny.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARİ.
A TRILL FOR THE TWELFTH.
Inscribed to the Faithful Commons.
With clear blue sky and the purple heather,
And amber and brown of the mountain stream,
You gaze entranced and you wonder whether
The days in London were all a dream.
There's health and life in the moorland breezes,
The doctors will say you inhale ozone;
The bore of the Club no longer teazes,
The bores of the House no longer drone.
The crowded ball and the dreary dinner
Are over, and Fashion decrees a rest
For tired M.P. and for money-spinner,
You seek it here on the mountain breast.
The birds are strong and the dogs are steady,
You tackle the hills with a keen delight;
· With eye that's keen and a hand that's ready,
And many the birds that fall ere night.
You voted late and you voted early,
You stuck to the Whips when they kept a House ;
But now you 're out of the hurly-burly,
May Fate reward you with endless grouse.

Fifty Years Since.
On Friday last the Prince of Wales presided at a
Meeting held in the Guildhall to celebrate the Jubilee of
the Abolition of Slavery in the British Colonies. And
fifty years hence they will probably be celebrating the
abolition of something which is considered to-day (as
Slavery was then) a buttress of Commerce and a Prop of
the State. Verbum sap.!

A LITTLE GAME FOR THE TWELFTH.
A PLEA FOR THE PAST.
(By Dumb-Crambo Junior.)
It is not Mr. Punch's custom to take any notice of anonymous
Correspondents, but the following plaintive epistle which came into
his possession in a somewhat peculiar manner-it was, in fact, dropped
down the chimney of the Fleet Street Sanctum at midnight-speaks
for itself; and is, withal, so patently truthful and genuinely touching
that the most punctilious and iron-hearted Editor would surely relax
in its favour the most rigid of journalistic rules. Mr. Punch gives
it verbatim et literatim :-
Space at Large, Midnight, August 1st, 1884.
HONOURED MR. PUNCH,

WHEN YOU HAVE ANYTHING OF A CONFIDENTIAL NATURE TO IMPART TO ME BEFORE THE NATIVES! SO MANY OF THEM UNDERSTAND

It seems to me, the notion that mankind is but a lotion,
Or rather, an insipid, thin infusion,
If widely tolerated, is distinctly calculated
To cause a deal of trouble and confusion.

PHOSPHORUS AND WATER.
THERE cannot be a doubt, as we all must have found out,
That Science does away with old delusions ;
And I frankly must confess that what I like still less
Is its tendency to shatter our illusions.
In more than one respect it seems painful to reflect
That one's petted little son or fav'rite daughter
Should be proved by learned lore to be really nothing more
Than some phosphorus and half-a-pail of water !
Flesh and blood are idle dreams-muscle is not what it seems-
Bone and hair are common errors ; so is sinew;
To believe in things we see, just as they appear to be,
Science warns us we no longer may continue.
Why, the mare that won the Oaks is no better than a hoax;
Do you think her present owner would have bought her
Had he known it as a fact that the animal he backed
Was--some phosphorus and half-a-pail of water ?
Can we hope the tender passion will not soon go out of fashion
If this theory be widely promulgated ?
Or that stolen glances, kisses, and the rest of lovers' blisses
• As absurdities will not be deprecated ?
If to married life inclined, many a girl will surely find
Life a trifle dull when Science shall have taught her
Not to waste her fond caresses on such unsubstantial messes
As—some phosphorus and half-a-pail of water !
While the sulky Peers are pouting, and the Radicals are shouting
For subversion of the British Constitution,
One could wish that Whig and Tory, to the chemist's greater glory,
Were restored to their original solution.
Why, I ask, should England cower to these cacklers of an hour,
Who by clamour to attend to them has wrought her ?
What are all these tedious babblers and unprofitable gabblers ?
Only phosphorus and half-a-pail of water!
LITTLE MUD-SALAD MARKET. - Mr. Punch recognises with plea-

what is the Marylebone Vestry going to do about the Costermongers'

which has earned for Goodge Street the glorious title of Little Mud-

We can highly recommend the experiment. We sat down on a
bench under a tree, with the Snailway Guide, and within five
minutes our body was as perfectly at rest as forty winks on a hot
afternoon and 91° in the shade can make it. When we awoke, our
brain was quite clear-and so were our pockets. But the thieving
villains had some sense of humour, for they had left us our Snailway

An English Gentleman always, with a high chivalry of manner
that in its passive reproach has been known to bring a blush to the
cheek of TIM HEALY—a man, by the way, not nearly so bad as he
paints himself. TREVELYAN the only Minister whose position no one

Recess,“ like a giant refreshed," as JOSEPH GILLIS said of himself
when, after All-night Sitting, he turned up at Five o'clock in the
morning, having passed night on two chairs in Library.
At Quarter-to-Six, when Orders come on, RANDOLPH suddenly
went on rampage. Blocked every Bill whatever its name or nature.
“What did you do that for?” I asked him.
“What makes the Malay run amuck occasionally ?” he said,
turning on me with sudden savageness. “Nay, don't be vexed, TOBY,
old man. Bear with me. I'm the most miserable of men. This

Thursday.—Bad look-out for House of Lords when irreproachable
young man like Viscount NEWPORT joins the enemy. Made most
effective diversion to-night in favour of Radicals, all the more power-
ful because he spoke from Conservative side, and will some day be
Earl of Bradford. In CHAMBERLAIN's speech at Birmingham, the
other day, there was, in convenient space of few lines, most damaging
indictment of Peers. Interest of Lords evidently to keep this in
background as much as possible. Speech a week old now. Forgotten
in rush of oratory. Thing for Radicals to do was to get some man to
pick it out and call attention to it in House of Commons. Plenty of
Liberals ready to do it, but that only half the game. Wanted a
Conservative, and, above all, an heir to Peerage. CHAMBERLAIN set
Caucus to work ; unlimited funds placed at their disposal. Could
do nothing. SCHNADHORST said he “would see.” At last hit upon
NEWPORT. Pointed out the effete condition of Peerage. No use to
stand by sinking ship. Fine prospect for able young man in Com-
mons. NEWPORT hesitated; asked for day to consider matter;
finally yielded, and affair came off to-night.
(STANLEY LEIGHTON, neighbour of NEWPORT's, noted for accuracy
where GLADSTONE or CHAMBERLAIN are concerned, tells me this.)
Everything managed well to smallest detail. Had NEWPORT put
notice of question on paper in ordinary way, half the effect lost.
Thing to do was to get passage read in House So NEWPORT, coming
down to-night, asked PREMIER what he thought of CHAMBERLAIN'S
words? House, quiet and dull at the moment, sprang into instant
excitement as NEWPORT read : “For hundred years the House of

THE POLITICAL TAM O'SHANTER.
ADAPTED, FRAGMENTARILY, FROM BURNS. APPLICATION—OBVIOUS.
| And eh! WEG saw a wondrous sight! How RANNIE leapt, and twirled, and flung
No man can tether time or tide,
Warlocks and witches in a dance,
(A supple jade she was and young),
And he who holds the reins must ride ; Egyptian whirls, and jigs from France; And how WEG stood like one bewitched,
And such a night WEG takes the road in Drum-thumpings loud, and fife-like squeals, How his eyes gleamed, how his mouth
As seldom rider was abroad in.
Put life and mettle in their heels.
|_ twitched.
With Boreas at his fullest blast,
High on a seat, with flaming eyes,
Even Satan glowered as though in pain,
And Eurus whistling fierce and fast,
There sat old Nick in human guise;.
And puffed and blew with might and main,
There was a shindy never fellowed.
Mastiff-like, stern, black, grim and large; Till with one caper and another,
Loud, deep, and long they raved and bellowed. To set the measures was his charge.
No longer Weg his words could smother,
That night of nights a Scot might say
He pitched the pipes, and made them skirl, But roars out, “ Well danced, Cutty Sark !”
The Deil (of Hatfield) was to pay.
Till the wild troop seemed all a-whirl. When in a moment all was dark;
Coffins stood round like open presses,
And scarce his mare and he had rallied
Well mounted on his mare was WEG,
And show'd dead Bills in foolscap dresses, When out the yelling legion sallied.
(A stouter never lifted leg,).
And by some dark, prophetic sleight
As bees buzz round a sugar-tub,
Through Irish-bog-like mud and mire,
Each held a boding spectral light,
Or workmen round an opening "pub,"
Wartonian wind, and Woodcock fire,
By which our wary WE was able
As M.P.'s rush to chase the grouse
Fought iron frame and shrewd head on it.
To spy, spread out upon a table,
When Prorogation clears the House,
WEG, holding fast his good Scots bonnet,
Late-murdered measures; cord or knife So the mare runs, the witches follow
Looked sharp around with prndent care,
Lest bogies take him unaware,
| Had robbed the innocents of life.
With many an eldritch shriek and hollow.
A proud Peer's garter one had strangled,
Or watchful foemen “wipe his eye”.
| And many more were maimed and mangled; | Ah, WEG! ah, WEG! they ’re nearing,
With that confounded thing, a “cry.” In short the scene was simply awful,
nearing,
By this time he was cross the ford
And WEG considered quite unlawful.
Like hounds on trail of a red-herring.
(Where he was very nearly floored),
Midlothian, WEG, awaits thy coming ;
And past the bog so dark and dank
But WEG knew what was what right well, They 'll think you 're lost, dear WEG, or
Where Snobdom's “CHARLIE" sprawled and And one young witch there bore the bell.

sank,
One late enlisted in the rout
Now, ride thy very hardest, WEG!
And through the sand-pit, Egypt-dark, (At Woodstock known and thereabout)
If the bridge key-stane feels her leg,
Where war-dogs seemed to lurk and bark; At many a measure she had shot,
| Thy mare at them her tail may toss,-
And the thorn-thicket, wild and wide, And many a plan had sent to pot;
| That running stream they cannot cross.
Where one had need be Argus-eyed.
Made many a plucky wight feel queer,
But ere the key-stone she could make,
Before him doom appears at flood,
And shooke'en her own side with fear.
The deuce a tail had she to shake,
Redoubling storm roars through the wood ; Her “cutty sark" of true-blue yarn,
| For Nickie, far before the rest,
Tongued lightnings flash from pole to pole, Which, up to now, the witch had worn,
Hard on that nag so nimble prest,
And vocal thunders fiercely roll.
In cut and fit was scant and strange.
And few at WEG with hope to settle ;
Some thought she hankered for a change,
But little knew he that mare's mettle.
But there was pluck in WEG's shrewd noddle, And that 'twas sad her youth's bright riches
One spring brought WEG off safe and hale,
He cared no more for threats than twaddle. Should e'er have graced a dance of witches.
| But left behind her own grey tail ;
His mare, though, was a bit astonished,
For with Nick's pull and the mare's jump,
Until, by hand and heel admonished,
But here my muse must faster flutter, WEG's nag was left with ne'er a stump!
She ventured forward on the light,
l'Tis scarce within her power to utter

FIFTY YEARS SINCE.
A Jubilee and its Lesson,
On Friday, August 1st, 1884, a meeting, presided over by the
Prince of WALES, and attended by persons of all ranks, of dif-
ferent creeds and of both political parties, was held at the
Guildhall to celebrate the Jubilee of the Abolition of Slavery in
the British Colonies.
FIFTY years since! Friends of delayed Reform
Take courage! Then what hate, what strife, what storm,
What fierce division, and what bodings dire !
Now Princes, Peers, and Party Chiefs conspire
In public gratulation at the blow
That was to lay our Crown, our Commerce low
In striking off the shackles from our slaves,
| But only freed the flag which proudly waves
| O'er many waters from a clinging stain.
MACAULAY, CLARKSON, WILBERFORCE, the gain
We owe to you and your brave band. Still teach
| Our untaught foes of progress that each breach
Of the obstructive barriers they'd defend,
Folly's blind champions, to the bitter end
Brings not the deluge, not black night and blood,
But freedom's ever-fertilising flood.
Teach still the old old lesson, teach until
Even the plague-spot of the West, Brazil,
Till even Statesmen stiff, and dogged Peers,
Mark that broad moral of the rolling years;
Convinced, as wisdom might not those convince
Who fought on Slavery's side Fifty Years Since !

VERY sad and rather funny, and fraught with strange
warning, is the programme of the new French Constitu-
tion that is to be, as its irony is unconsciously brought
out in a Times' leading article which describes it.

prayers which the Constitution enacts shall be offered up at the

Has ever proved a gilded stye. FLUKE mostly

Inclined to the flamboyant, à la TIGG:
There still is left no little of the Ape
But those huge domes, for all their glitter ghostly,
In Man, and FLUKE, in everything high-flying,
Ne'er shone above their happy owner's head,
Fad-bitten, but intent on wide renown,
For ere the pile was finished Fluke had fled.
Resolved to build the biggest house in Town.
Whither none knew save MALLOW the astute,
FLUKE was a “brawny brute.” The phrase is Mallow's,
Whose nest was neatly feathered. MALLOW smiled
Not mine, and MALLow was his toady sleek,
At all allusions to the "brawny brute,”
Who knew his tyrant's soul, its depths and shallows,
But when his company were safely “tiled,"
And had a mordant tongue, although so meek.
Could tell queer tales of him. The wild pursuit
But FLUKE possessed the grace that all things hallows,
Of wealth and whim-things seldom reconciled-
The Danaë-dower that peers and pitmen seek.
Had led him through strange courses to a crash
Though MALLOW's phrase quite fitted, many a Duke
Scarce equalled in the chronicles of Smash.
Was very well content to dine with FLUKE.
Balclutha's halls were not more desolate
Few knew his story; a perspective dim
Than was FLUKE's Folly. Vulgar BECKFORD, he
Aimed apishly at such Neronian state
Makes no bad background for a portrait bold.
As strikes a shallow-souled Society.
That big bull-throat, that jaw close-clenched and grim,
The Golden House Art-Barnums emulate,
In wild old days when FLUKE prospected gold
Mammon's mixed rout of rank and rascalry
Had served him well. Now the last social whim
Complete in flaunting profitless parade,
On this unpolished person had fast hold;
As though his history held no scene more dark
That reeks of lucre and that stinks of trade.
Than fits with Cheyne Walk or Bedford Park.
Less love of Beauty than desire of Show
Inspires the new ambition of the Town.
Behold him, broadly built, of florid hue,
Such souls love Loveliness as old DE CROWE
The throat of Hercules on shoulders square,
Loves his superb young wife. To take her down
With cold wide-lidded eyes of staring blue
To dinner, swells will thaw the ice and snow
Scarlet-shot tigerishly, stiff rufous hair,
Of Fashion's boreal “repose.” The clown
Big fingers lavishly beringed! But few
Who builds a palace huge for an hotel,
Could see him in a boudoir of Mayfair
May claim to worship Beauty just as well.
Without some feeling of congruity's lack,
She serves the aspiring huckster at his need,
As of a bison amidst bric-à-brac.
That is she draws his guests and fills his coffers.
His scarf-pin shaped of a huge nugget, spake
Her shrine is one at which keen Cockney Greed
Of days when fierce-eyed men hung on his word,
_ And worldly Vanity make lavish proffers.
Eager the gold-vein's track from him to take,
FLUKE failed, but many of his sort succeed,
Or pistol him for failure. He had heard
And then how dumb are moralists and scoffers !
Curses that nerves of iron well might shake,
Swelling R.A., swell-tradesman, swollen Duke
Change into jubilant shoutings wild, absurd,
Are sometimes motived much like RODWELL FLUKE.
And still kept eye and trigger-finger steady,
RHODOPE's dust, and KUBLA KHAN's a vision,
For every shift of ruffian fortune ready.
Fonthill's a shade and SOLOMON a shadow;
Now cockneyfied, externally at least,
Gone are all glories of all haunts Elysian,
By seven sharp years of City speculation,
Castles in air, and towers in El Dorado:
FLUKE shone at fashionable rout or feast,
But-worthy of more resolute derision-
And, under MALLOW's skilful education,
We to ambition coarse and flaunting fad owe
Threw off the tiger, or so veiled the beast
The new “House Beautiful,” Ideal bold
Beneath a bland and burly ostentation
Conceived by Vanity, grossly shaped by Gold !
Of bonhomie that judges of the Town
Dubbed him good fellow with a touch of clown.

It may be remembered that Professor BUSKIN during the Spring
addressed a letter to a provincial paper, respecting the projected
new railway for Derbyshire. As he therein expressed some very
strong opinions against the scheme, as one likely to give the miser-
able, melancholy, and toiling millions who dwell in smoke-stifling
and unwholesome towns, an occasional chance of letting a little
bright fresh air and sunlight in upon the gloom of their darkened
lives, it is satisfactory to know that the letter in question is now
believed to have been a clever hoax. At any rate, the zenith of that
boon to millions, the summer excursion season has produced a second

communication to the same journal: and, as it not only bears
the Professor's signature, but breathes with the spirit of his larger
philanthropy, there can be little doubt as to its authenticity.
In the course of this second letter, Professor BUSKIN says:
“I do not know how this mental revolution has come about within
me, nor, were you to ask me, could I tell you. I only recognise the
stupendous fact that I feel, and am not ashamed to avow, that I no
longer regard the wild witchery of the Derbyshire glens as a precious

A NEW DANGER.
DOUBTLESS, as the Poet says,-
"-Evil is wrought
By want of thought
As well as by want of heart.”
But there are certain thoughtless imbecilities so mis-
chievous, and so inexcusable, that they almost merit
punishment as crimes. Mr. T. G. BRADEN, Consulting
Surgeon for Lewes Infirmary, describes a ghastly and
dangerous wound inflicted upon a workman on the line
by a bottle, thrown from a train in motion by some
unspeakable noodle of a passenger-name, unluckily,
unknown. Society will have to protect itself in some
way against the thoughtless and callously reckless fools

and not easy adequately to deal with when detected
Anyone who should give information which might lead
to the discovery of the mischievous booby who flung that

The Lords wish the whole measure, one-
half of which they have refused to pass,
and the other half of which no one has yet
seen-probably because it is not yet in
sight to be passed in October, in order that
they may give their whole minds to showing
the same loving care for Pheasants as they
have long displayed for Peasants.
The Lords want the BILL, the whole BILL,
and nothing but the BILL, but they decline
to receive it at the hands of WILLIAM.
They are so anxious, so eager, so deter-
mined to have their own complete Bill, that
they will fight the incomplete Bill of the
incapable Government, clause by clause,
and line by line; and as they have a gre-
garious, obedient, strong-headed majority
of some sixty or seventy, they can promise
their beloved friends, the Agricultural La-
bourers, that no votes shall be forced upon
them, except on such conditions as their
Lords approve.
The Government want to give them votes
at once, untrammelled by other considera-
tions. The Lords refuse to give them votes
until means can be found to render them
harmless. Let the People judge between
the two!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TOWN.
No. XII.-SCIENCE.
WHAT says the Sage ? “A wise interrogation
Is the best half of Science.” Now, indeed,
Science obeys Baconian
exhortation,
Since everything, from
comets up to creeds,
Spite Orthodoxy's heavy
indignation,
This mighty ministrant
to mortal needs,
Proud of its late complete
emancipation,
Subjects to pitiless “inter-
rogation,"
Pitiless? Yes. Scalpel
and syllogism
Are equally remorseless.
Yet withal
Science has now received
the Social chrism.
The Drawing Room in-
vades the Lecture Hall,
Sweet lips lisp low of ology
and ism,
And shaggy Seers at ban-
quet and at ball
Pose with polite complacent consciousness,
As oracles of lore in evening dress.
“And why not?” cute McCOCKER crackles. He
Is five feet four, but bantam-built and bland;
He has an eye that's bold, a tongue that's free,
A fat, emphatic, dimpled, little hand.
His knowledge, quite an unknown quantity,
Is liberally dispensed about the land
In lecture, little book, and leading article.
Of shy reserve the man has not a particle.
He is an F.R.S., and has the right
To add a lengthy string of learned letters.
The “Row” regards him as a Shining Light,
Bacon and HUMBOLDT may have been his betters
In brain, but he in knowledge beats them quite;
They were half-bound in theologic fetters,
But Science now is Free, and nought can shock her
Back into bonds,-according to McCOCKER,
Encyclopædic knowledge sometimes comes
From the Encyclopædia. Some declare
McCOCKER's lore the brazenest of hums;
But then, you see, one meets him everywhere.
From Learning's tables even the very crumbs,
Well managed, make a showy bill of fare.
But be that as it may, why need we busy us
To prove McCOCKER a new DIONYSIUS ?
LAPLACE or LARDNER little cares Society
So that its learned lion is amusing.
McCOCKER's talk has infinite variety,
And if sometimes he might be found contusing
His shins against big subjects, did dubiety
Not tie his hearers' tongues, there's no refusing
The praise the little pundit earns so well
Of being an unabashed Sir Oracle.
And Science now, like Art, has learned to bend
To Fashion and to Trade; cannot resist
The lure of lucre, stoops its aid to lend
To shrewder knaves than Jonson's Alchemist.
Fraud looks to it as a most useful friend,
The purchased praises of the Analyst
To Food-men's vaunts the public ear incline,
Or help the vending of a worthless Wine.
Then why should not McCOCKER, like the rest,
Exploit his cheap omniscience where so few
Can put its proud pretensions to the test ?
His cometary prophecies, 'tis true,
Miscarried most amusingly, his quest
Of the true cause of the auroral hue
Of certain sunsets proved a curious case
Of the right scientific wild-goose chase.
But what of that? A Kepler may mistake;
A Newton-trying prophecies-go wrong.
A smart sensation article may make
A reputation with the unlearned throng.
Science, the modern Titan, doomed to shake
The ancient Heavens, is so proudly strong,
It may survive, in calm serene secureness,
A great deal of erroneous cock-sureness.
Among the blind the one-eyed man is king,
And when McCOCKER plays the Polyphemus
In boudoir or in studio, who shall bring
Ulysses, from his thraldom, to redeem us?
Ulysses sits at home, slow ripening
Fruits of true knowledge, and would troublers deem us.
Though he, indeed, could tell us how unstable
Is Fashion's pseudo-scientific Babel.
For Science hath its Babel. Autumn's glow
Heralds its many voices. Pundit Peers
And femmes savantes rhetorically flow,
Or dully stammer 'midst factitious cheers.
Sensational summaries, disquisitions slow
Tickle or bore Society's foolish ears,
Fill many a column, furnish many a joke,
And end, 'twere too severe to say in smoke.
But modish Science is a sciolist;
There spreads a bridgeless and unsounded chasm
Between great Nature's true anatomist
And platform prattlers about protoplasm.
The host of spouting dabblers can't resist
That tendency to shallowness and spasm
Which Art and Science, Poetry and Passion
Alike display when they are made the fashion.
How the Factitious sways us! How Pretence
Worms at the heart of movements and of modes,
Dictates our tastes, our pleasures, our expense,
Our zestless customs, and our zanyish codes;
Bids us take BRISTLER'S coxcombry for sense,
Find Sapphic fire in Slop's salacious odes,
And make believe to hear without satiety
Prosings of the Pan-Cosmical Society.
There shines Lord LIMPET, there Miss PECKER prattles,
And there the Reverend Cosmos CRUMP declaims,
On women's souls and sufferings, or on cattle's.
There coteries trumpet forth their favourite names,
Half men of science, half agreeable rattles,
Midst whom, the idol of the learned dames,
McCOCKER, leads logomachy or laugh
Good equally at mot and "monograph."
Purveyor he of scientific padding,
Sandwiched between sensation and small rhymes,
In half the magazines. His genius gadding
Shines in all spheres and traverses all times,
Stoops to gay chat on fashionable fadding,
Soars to the course of comets or of crimes,
Deals with lawn-tennis or with sanitation,
With “poker,” or spontaneous generation.
Science? The shallow talk that takes the Town
At Congresses or Conversazioni,
The dilettante chat which brings renown
To modish mimes of BASTIAN or BELZONI,
URANIA might regard with haughty frown;
But though MCCOCKER, like the Scriptural coney,
Is a small creature, he contrives to play
The Social Lion in a wondrous way.
Fashion must smile on Science, or be shut
From Culture's “ring" at its selectest corner.
“The savant is a bore one cannot cut!”.
Sighs FRIBBLE, with the face of a chief-mourner.
Society may not crack the Sphinxian nut,
But it can play the sciolist Jack Horner,
Pick plums from the Darwinian pie, and flourishing
The crude harsh fruit, declare it nice and nourishing.
'Tis so the Town creates and crowns its Shams,
Missing the real with a care most curious;
Inspired by fads, it idolises flams
With hollow zeal, enthusiasm spurious,
Its eagerness to gorge Cant's latest crams
Is most factitious when it seems most furious.
Wherefore it worships, foolishly deific,
The simulacrum of the Scientific!

I introduce GEORGE DOE to DUDLEY CHIVERS, who becomes sud-

toilette for six francs extra. Will he change, and come to mine?
He replies, heartily, “I'll do whatever you like-my name's
Easy!”-what a charming travelling companion !-adding imme-
diately, "I've got all my things in here, and I've paid eighteen
francs. Hadn't you better come into mine?”
CHARLES, the Chasseur, murmurs in my ear that I shall have to
pay another supplément of twelve francs, and that then we shan't be
80 comfortable, as there is a washing-place in mine.
"But, my dear fellow," says DUDLEY, pleasantly, "you won't
always want to sleep. You'd better come in here."
And so, yielding to the gentleman who has announced that “his
name is EASY, I pay the extra amount, and CHARLES moves all my
things--my "goods and chattels," as Mr. PENLEY calls them in The
Private Secretary, and mount into DUDLEY's coupé lit, in a corner
of which he has already comfortably installed himself.
"It's fitted up with sliding-seats,” says CHIVERS; “yours wasn't."
"No, but mine has a washing-stand," I return; to which he only
replies -

The prospect of unbroken rest

(Some way after Sir Walter Scott.)
Time rolls his ceaseless course. That fight of
yore,
When the Great Earl was beaten to his
knee,
When GL ADSTONE's rhetoric rolled from shore
to shore,
Herald and' harbinger of victory,
Is not yet blotted from man's memory.
How few, how weak and withered of their
force
The Tory remnant, which all men might see
Like stranded wrecks. The tide returning
hoarse
Sets them afloat again! Time rolls its cease-
less course.
There yet live those who can remember well
When last the Liberal Chief his bugle blew;|
When county broad and borough big, as well
As far Midlothian's heart, the signal knew,
And fast the faithful clan around him drew.
And now again his warning note is wound,
Again the banner floats as then it flew; ...
Whilst now the clamorous war-pipes shrilly
sound,
And now the Fiery Cross gleams like a
meteor round.
The Summer Sun's effulgent hue
Gilds Scotia's skies of bluest blue ;
Autumn's at hand, but a brisk breeze,
Born of conflicting policies,
Blows o'er the land, and leisure coy,
And sport's supreme soul-stirring joy,
'Tis all prepared! Firm as a rock,
And bold to brave the stormiest shock,
With kindling eye, with floating plaid,
Wide waving hair, and flashing blade,
The Chieftain stands, heroic, grim,
Of dauntless front, and sinewy limb.
The Cross is shaped, and held on high ;
The Chieftain of the eagle-eye
Rears it aloft with clutch of steel,
Whilst far resounds his fierce appeal :-
“When flits this Cross from man to man,
VICH-GLADSTONE's summons to his clan,
Woe to the clansman who shall view
This symbol, loved of followers true,
Forgetful that when last the blue
Beheld its blaze its beaconing drew
BEACONSFIELD's glory low !
Deserter of his Chieftain's trust,
He shall be scattered like the dust,
And from all loyal gatherings thrust,
Each clansman's execration just
Shall doom him wrath and woe!”
He stops ;-the word his followers take
With forward step and fiery shake
Of naked brands that lightnings make,
And clattering shields that echoes wake;
And first in murmur low,
Then, like a Demonstration's course
That Hydeparkwards doth hie in foro',
And purple shouts itself, and hoarse,
Burst from that thousand-throated source,
“Woe to such traitors, woe!”
No thought of peace or Autumn rest
Hath harbour in the Chieftain's breast.
With unsheathed broadsword in his hand,
He'll pace the war-awakened land.
Strife's rising he has heard, and laid
His hand upon his ready blade.
His foot's a rock. His vassals' care
Midlothian promptly will prepare,
Where he aforetime lessons taught,
With deep and deathful meaning fraught;
Where they shall meet and whence abroad
The Cross of Fire shall take its road.
The land would hear his vocal blasts,
And see the flashing glance he casts :
Such glance the mountain-eagle throws,
When high among the peaks and snows
He spreads his pinions on the wind,
And, like an albatross reclined
Mid-air, with his broad shadow hushes
The chirpers of the brakes and bushes.
The Chief's grey locks defiant wave,
The Tories scarce that Cross may brave;
The exulting Rads hurrah afar
They know the voice of GLADSTONE'S War!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TOWN.
No. XI.—“FORM.” A LEGEND OF MODERN LONDON.
PART II.
SOCIETY set its seal upon the work,
And AUTO very soon became its hero.
SHERIDAN's wit, the eloquence of BURKE,
Would scarce have lifted him from life's cold zero;
But not the morals of
the turban'd Turk
The turpitude of
Borgia or of NERO,
May keep a man
from winning the
world's smile
If only he is once
pronounced “good
style."
And Auto's style was
of the best, his
" form,"
As turfmen say of
steeds, was "un-
deniable."
The heart of OUIDA'S
muse to him might
warm,
He won Platonic
love from Lady
PLIABLE.
“There never was,"
said ISOBEL DE-
LORME,
"A leader of cotillon so reliable.”
He ne'er was known in dance or dress to fail, or
To disappoint his partner or his tailor,
He had no troublesome opinions, none,
That is, which interfered with elasticity
Of social adaptation; finding fun
Where“ other fellows" found it, in lubricity
And cynic ridicule of every one
Why showed enthusiasm or simplicity,
Two species of bad form which the polite
Agree to find intolerable, quite.
His tastes were tepid, all the tastes at least
He openly acknowledged. “Not half bad !”
Meant warm approval from his lips; a feast,
A play, a pretty girl, the latest fad,
Were all so summarised. The placid East
His calm repose had envied; something sad
His general mien, but that was caused, no doubt,
By optic languor and a labial pout.
These facial fashions are de règle, quite,
With modern youth, have no more moral meaning
Than Woman's smile when she would be polite.
To see young Auto indolently leaning
Against a door-jamb was a wondrous sight.
" Clockwork !” you'd cry, “with works in need of
cleaning."
But waltzing and lawn-tennis served to prove
That it, at any rate, was made to move.
He was a very great success indeed ;
Many Mammas and several daughters sought him.
STEIN was reputed wealthy; grace and greed
In more than one case fancied they had caught him.
But whether these manoeuvres would succeed
Seemed doubtful. AUTO's intimates had taught him
Love-bonds, all very well when light and airy,
Drawn to a noose are snares for the unwary.
AUTO's philosophy of love and life
Was scarce domestic. Still, it was reported
The Pink of Form was going to take a wife,
He the long cold, and generally courted !
But just as rumour's babble was most rife,
The chased, the warned, the counselled, the exhorted,
Did that which growing hopes abashed or banished,
For, like a Boojum, suddenly he vanished !
Vanished completely, leaving not a clue !
Society was startled. Things look serious
When social lions disappear from view.
“Missing” 's a heading pleasantly mysterious
In penny papers; but this marvel grew
Till curiosity became imperious.
Poor OSCAR CRUDEN had an awful time,
And felt like one suspected of a crime.
STEIN only seemed untroubled. But one night
When he received ”-a thing of passing rarity-
A guest, of the inquiry making light,
Ånd under shield of humorous hilarity,
Said “STEIN, what is the cause of AUTO's flight ?
Do tell us, it would be a real charity,
For nothing ever fogged Society so
Since JUNIUS wrote those letters, don't you know.”
The Painter smiled, a queer sardonic smile.
"AUTO ?” said he, his flight? You are mistaken ;
Auto is here, and has been all the while.”
The guests with sharp astonishment were shaken;
They stared and rubbed their eyes in such a style,
As they had dreamed and much desired to waken.
“Yes," pursued STEIN, “I simply keep him here,
Because he's got a little out of gear.”
6. Behold !” And here the Painter drew aside
A curtain from an alcove. There he stood
In full effulgence and sartorial pride,
With lips that drooped, and eyes that seemed to brood,
Auto himself! Young CRUDEN made one stride,
Then halted as in hesitating mood.
“ Still puzzled ?" cried the Painter. “Well, restrain
Your eagerness a moment. I'll explain.
“I had a theory that a modish youth
Might well fulfil his fashionable function
Without a heart or brain, reason or ruth.
AUTO has neither conscience nor compunction,
And so I think my theory proves truth.
You know we're an ingenious conjunction
Of atoms and of forces; the emphatic
Verdict of Science is, “Man's automatic !'
“I've studied deep in very curious schools,
And,-well, I know some darlings of Society
Are cold conventional mechanic fools,
As destitute of wit as, say, of piety.
I held that to conform to social rules
Needs neither mental vigour nor variety;
And thought a Marionette might well be found
To carry out the whole dull mill-wheel round.
“I held, especially, 'Good Form'a thing
Within the compass of dynamics purely,
Contrivable by lever, weight, and spring,
Compacted cleverly and bound securely.
And I resolved to prove my doctrine, bring
My theory to demonstration surely.
Which now, I hope, you will allow I've done,
For Auto is—a mere automaton!
“You never guessed it? No! I, FRANK N. STEIN,
Have shaped no monster but a working model
Of modish youth. This masterpiece of mine
Can dress and dance, play tennis, flirt, and twaddle,
Possesses 'Form' in every look and line,
A dummy's heart, and a lay figure's noddle.
He's now run down-but when I've time to mend him,
Into Society once more I'll send him.”,
They were too wonderstruck, the Painter's guests, ! :
To question or protest. His smile sardonie .
Imposed blank silence to their burdened breasts,
They shrunk before his courtesy laconic.
There are few things Society so detests,
Or is so bothered by, as the ironie.
It taxes brains to be for ever gleaning
The sense of a satiric double meaning, time
But when they came to think the matter over
They grew indignant, which was scarce surprising ;
The explanation they could not discover,
For AUTO's gun had set, to know no rising.
They knew that STEIN of talk was no great lover,
And was intolerant of catechising,
So they declared, as interest grew fainter,
“ 'Twas all a trick of that confounded Painter!”

Swift through the orient air,
As westward low the sun's fierce glow
Burns with a blood-red glare.
And far to north GORDONIUS,
Knight of the stainless lance,
Looks o'er the foe-thronged Desert
With long-expectant glance.
The Cockney baits his angle,
Or loads his gun, but oh!
Little thinks he of once strong limbs
Dead in those sands below.
But things, 'midst plaint and laughter,
Drag on from day to day,
And nothing seems to follow
From council or from fray.
But whilst some talk of truckling,
And curse the Old Man Grand,
Men are aware of a lordly pair
Descending on the land.
They float, arm-linked and airy,
All-confident appear,
And forth with all the ranks at home
Seem of far better cheer.
Men hope that by far Nilus
Things soon will look more bright,
The MAHDI settled on the left,
The Turk upon the right.
“What think ye?” cries GLADSTONIUS.
"I'll not desert the field,
Though unto pressure premature
I am not prone to yield.
GORDONIUS yet I'll rescue
All in my own good time,
And settle things in general up
In that far Coptic clime.
Rail not at my past blunders
(If what ye deem they are),
The Shining Brethren see at last !
They 'll soon put all things square!,'
But now the Great Twin Brethren
Of mortal eyes are seen,
And optics many a hundred
Glow at the sight I ween,
And to the Great Twin Brethren
Many make vows, and pray
That they in council and in fight
May keep their heads alway.
For there is mess and muddle
O'er all the Coptic land,
War that men cannot love, and peace
Men cannot understand."
For head with head agrees not,
Hand doth not act with hand,
And feet seem feebly stumbling
Like steps on shifting sand.
GLADSTONIUs is Dictator,
The man of seventy fights,
He made the stout SYLVANUS
His Master of the Knights.
The Ancient Great Twin Brethren,
Castor and Pollux hight,
Were held to bring the ship to shore,
And help the Chief in fight.
Our modern Dioscuri
Are on their airy way,
“Helpers of mortals" named of old-
May they bring help to-day!

THE TOWN.
No. XII.—SCIENCE.
WHAT says the Sage? “A wise interrogation
Is the best half of Science.” Now, indeed,
Science obeys Baconian
exhortation,...
Since everything, from
comets up to creeds,
Spite Orthodoxy's heavy
'indignation,
This mighty ministrant
to mortal needs,
Proud of its late complete
emancipation,
Subjects to pitiless “inter-
rogation."
Pitiless? Yes. Scalpel
and syllogism
Are equally remorseless.
Yet withal
Science has now received
the Social chrism.
The Drawing Room in-
vades the Lecture Hall,
Sweet lips lisp low of ology
and ism,
And shaggy Seers at ban-
quet and at ball
Pose with polite complacent consciousness,
As oracles of lore in evening dress.
“And why not?” cute McCOCKER crackles. He
Is five feet four, but bantam-built and bland;
He has an eye that's bold, a tongue that's free,
A fat, emphatic, dimpled, little hand.
His knowledge, quite an unknown quantity,
Is liberally dispensed about the land
In lecture, little book, and leading article.
Of shy reserve the man has not a particle.
He is an F.R.S., and has the right
To add a lengthy string of learned letters.
The “Row” regards him as a Shining Light,
Bacon and HUMBOLDT may have been his betters
In brain, but he in knowledge beats them quite;
They were half-bound in theologic fetters,
But Science now is Free, and nought can shock her
Back into bonds,-according to McCOCKER,
Encyclopædic knowledge sometimes comes
From the Encyclopædia. Some declare
McCOCKER's lore the brazenest of hums;
But then, you see, one meets him everywhere.
From Learning's tables even the very crumbs,
Well managed, make a showy bill of fare.
But be that as it may, why need we busy us
To prove McCOCKER a new DIONYSIUS ?
LAPLACE or LARDNER little cares Society
So that its learned lion is amusing.
McCOCKER's talk has infinite variety,
And if sometimes he might be found contusing
His shins against big subjects, did dubiety
Not tie his hearers' tongues, there's no refusing
The praise the little pundit earns so well
Of being an unabashed Sir Oracle.
And Science now, like Art, has learned to bend
To Fashion and to Trade; cannot resist
The lure of lucre, stoops its aid to lend
To shrewder knayes than JONSON's Alchemist.
Fraud looks to it as a most useful friend,
The purchased praises of the Analyst
To Food-men's vaunts the public ear incline,
Or help the vending of a worthless Wine.
Then why should not McCOCKER, like the rest,
Exploit his cheap omniscience where so few
Can put its proud pretensions to the test ?
His cometary prophecies, 'tis true,
Miscarried most amusingly, his quest
Of the true cause of the auroral hue
Of certain sunsets proved a curious case
Of the right scientific wild-goose chase.
But what of that? A Kepler may mistake;
A Newton-trying prophecies-go wrong,
A smart sensation article may make
A reputation with the unlearned throng.
Science, the modern Titan, doomed to shake
The ancient Heavens, is so proudly strong,
It may survive, in calm serene secureness,
A great deal of erroneous cock-sureness.
Among the blind the one-eyed man is king,
And when McCOCKER plays the Polyphemus
In boudoir or in studio, who shall bring
Ulysses, from his thraldom, to redeem us?
Ulysses sits at home, slow ripening
Fruits of true knowledge, and would troublers deem us.
Though he, indeed, could tell us how unstable
Is Fashion's pseudo-scientific Babel.
For Science hath its Babel. Autumn's glow
Heralds its many voices. Pundit Peers
And femmes savantes rhetorically flow,
Or dully stammer 'midst factitious cheers.
Sensational summaries, disquisitions slow
Tickle or bore Society's foolish ears,
Fill many a column, furnish many a joke,
And end, 'twere too severe to say in smoke.
But modish Science is a sciolist;
There spreads a bridgeless and unsounded chasm
Between great Nature's true anatomist
And platform prattlers about protoplasm.
The host of spouting dabblers can't resist
That tendency to shallowness and spasm
Which Art and Science, Poetry and Passion
Alike display when they are made the fashion.
How the Factitious sways us! How Pretence
Worms at the heart of movements and of modes,
Dictates our tastes, our pleasures, our expense,
Our zestless customs, and our zangish codes;
Bids us take BRISTLER's coxcombry for sense,
Find Sapphic fire in SLOP's salacious odes,
And make believe to hear without satiety
Prosings of the Pan-Cosmical Society.
There shines Lord LIMPET, there Miss PECKER prattles,
And there the Reverend Cosmos CRUMP declaims,
On women's souls and sufferings, or on cattle's.
There coteries trumpet forth their favourite names,
Half men of science, half agreeable rattles,
Midst whom, the idol of the learned dames,
McCOCKER, leads logomachy or laugh
Good equally at mot and "monograph."
Purveyor he of scientific padding,
Sandwiched between sensation and small rhymes,
In half the magazines. His genius gadding
Shines in all spheres and traverses all times,
Stoops to gay chat on fashionable fadding,
Soars to the course of comets or of crimes,
Deals with lawn-tennis or with sanitation,
With “poker,” or spontaneous generation.
Science? The shallow talk that takes the Town
At Congresses or Conversazioni,
The dilettante chat which brings renown
To modish mimes of BASTIAN or BELZONI,
URANIA might regard with haughty frown;
But though McCOCKER, like the Scriptural coney,
Is a small creature, he contrives to play
The Social Lion in a wondrous way.
Fashion must smile on Science, or be shut
From Culture's “ring" at its selectest corner.
“ The savant is a bore one cannot cut!”.
Sighs FRIBBLE, with the face of a chief-mourner.
Society may not crack the Sphinxian nut,
But it can play the sciolist Jack Horner,
Pick plums from the Darwinian pie, and flourishing
The crude harsh fruit, declare it nice and nourishing.
'Tis so the Town creates and crowns its Shams,
Missing the real with a care most curious ;
Inspired by fads, it idolises flams
With hollow zeal, enthusiasm spurious,
Its eagerness to gorge Cant's latest crams
Is most factitious when it seems most furious.
Wherefore it worships, foolishly deific,
The simulacrum of the Scientific !

THE SORROWS OF
SANITATION.
[Dr. MORTIMER GRANVILLE re-

I'm weary of the dwellings known
As sanitary houses;...
I'm quite contented with my own,
Though its condition rouses
The scorn of all our Engineers-
Who head this modern move-

Each man possessing, it appears,
A patented improvement.
I'm tired of all this endless noise,
And talk on sanitation;
The plumber comes, and heenjoys,
Of course, the situation.
He brings the ventilating-trap,
Which may be scientific;
I know I'm scarcely “worth a
His bil is so terrific.
I'm bound to try electric light,
To Swan and ŠIEMENS trusting;
I wake up thinking in the night
The whole concern is “bust-

They say there's danger lurks in
dirt,
And typhoid in a paddle,'
And death in coloured socks and
shirt;-
It's all a precious muddle.
Oh, give me back the good old days
Before these men ran riot,
To stand within the ancient ways,
By open drains in quiet.

I'm always on the anvil,

The House where I was bred;
The Woolsack, whence the CHAN-
CELLOR
That annual Message read.
He never came till after four,
And rarely stayed till five;
For, if their dinners were delayed,
Could Senators survive ?
I remember, I remember,
The Marquises and Earls,
The peerless rows of Peeresses,
Those flowers decked in pearls.
The cross-bench, where the Princes
And where the Prelates shone
In piety and lawn arrayed-
The Bishops now are gone!
I remember, I remember,
Where I was used to spout,
And thought the papers must be
mad
To leave my speeches out.
My eloquence was practised then,
That now is left to rust;
And Statesmen oft, I'm sure,
have winced
Before my boyish thrust!
I remember, I remember,
The Commons trooping in;
I used to think that in a fight
The Peers must always win.
It was a childish ignorance,
But now 'tis little joy
To know I'm kicked out of the

GENUINE ENTHUSIASTS,
WATCHING THE FINALE OF A LAWN-TENNIS TOURNAMENT IN THE TEETH OF A COLD EAST WIND.
A DAY IN THE COUNTRY.
(From a Fresh Point of View.)
A Day in the Country! O phrase full of cheer
For the Town-dweller tired, at this time of the year!
Well, supposing we make the experiment !
Pheugh! What a blaze Father Phæbus sends down!
It will parch up the Thames, and bake everything brown
Near the terrible flags of that horrible Town;
But, where we are going, the veriest clown
In freshness may dwell, in green herbage may drown.
For-of course rural parts must sustain their renown
For healthiness, beauty, and merriment.
The whiff of-the whiff of the well, when you think of it,
It smells like a sewer to one on the brink of it.
It cannot be that though, of course.
For indeed did our stout rural labourers dwell
In the midst of this very peculiar smell,
Their pull over Town 'twere not easy to tell.
Where are we, and what is its source ?
A hamlet-(that odour is sickly and faint)—
That a GOLDSMITH might sing or a CONSTABLE paint,
The dwelling of labouring swains.
It is hard by the gates of a Nobleman's Hall,
Near a Park's noble spread and a river's bright fall.
Who would not be a gay agricultural “thrall,”
To inherit such obvious gains ?
For, of course-(just a sniff of Cologne, if you please !)-
In the midst of the meadows, the hedges, and trees,
Of the flower-scents borne by a health-giving breeze,
'Neath the fatherly sway of a Noble at ease,
The swains must be happy as larks,
And regard with compassion the wretched slum-dwellers
Whose pitiful tale has had so many tellers;
Grim Babylon's legions of buyers and sellers,
Who knowing their London, like so many Wellers,
For music have Costerdom's howlers and yellers,
For greenness the Squares and the Parks.
And these are their dwellings, those fortunate swains !
What tumble-down sheds! What defacements and stains !
What an obvious absence of cisterns and drains !
The windows how shaky, how broken the panes !
The whole how uncleanly and squalid !
That full fetid dusthole, that sink choked with slime,
Are worthy St. Pancras. The foul haunts of crime
In Southwark scaroe show more of filth, stench, and grime,
Or faces more pinched or more pallid.
Those staircases shaky, those mouldering floors,
Those damp rotting roofs and those hingeless old doors,
Remind one of “ Goldgrubber's Rents."
But they call the sweet neighbourhood Paradise Green,
And it isn't a slum, for some pigstyes are seen,
And Town cannot boast of their scents.
The churchyard and cowshed are here cheek by jowl,
Or else broken rain-pipe and soot-cumbered cowl,
And piles of old refuse ill-favoured and foul
"Might make a Town-dweller suppose
It was Horrible London he gazed on, and not
The scene of the gay rural labourer's lot,
For plainly he could not distinguish the spot
From the festering slum that is Babylon's blot
By the verdict of eye or of nose.
And here, in the midst of these sights and these scents,
The Marquis of CARABAS gathers his rents,
How happy the Marquis should be !
For what more delightful than doing one's duty
By humble retainers midst health, joy, and beauty,
Pure pleasure and pastoral glee ?
Seems quite mediæval and nice, does it not ?
And rather reminds one of dear WALTER SCOTT,
Of the feudal and proudly paternal.
And only to think that the same sort of thing
Might so general be; that glad rustios might sing
Iu security sweet 'neath Nobility's wing,
To Lord MANNERS' delight, if the Radical ring
All the ways of the right Good Old Times would not fling
Into “ Progress's” cauldron infernal!

SIMON was nothing, save a splendid “whip,”
A billiard-crack, and fifty small things more;
But any chance those fingers slim let slip,
Any advantage that he failed to score,
Or any quarry that escaped his catching
Was little likely to be worth the snatching.
A Business Man! Civic Philistia
Makes that ideal its peculiar Dagon;
That phrase leaves very little more to say.
What means it? One who is content to fag on
In Mammon's dusty mill from day to day,
Play the St. George to Poverty's grim Dragon,
By toil that relaxation dares not hazard ?
Well, 'twas not altogether so with BAZZARD.
But he was sharp, oh, needle-sharp indeed !
No pachyderm who prowled primeval slime on
Was hungrier, or harder in his greed.
Mistrustful too, a very Cockney Timon
Or cynic of the Apemanthian breed.
“Sharp versus Flat," opined his Mentor, SIMON,
“Sums human history from ADAM down."
A creed with huge attraction for the Town.
Man's primal duty as a Business Being-
And what is Being without Business worth 2-
Is not to be a “Flat,” that dire fate fleeing
As quite the most degrading doom on earth.
It means straight deed, and undistorted seeing,
Faith, kindliness-all themes for crackling mirth.
For truth, and tenderness, and non-avidity
Are only minor phases of Stupidity.
So BAZZARD held at heart, so hundreds hold
Who tacitly subscribe FLIP's formulary.
BAZZARD was a Bookmaker, shrewd and bold,
At least he fancied so, though judgments vary.
Race meetings knew him well, those glances cold,
Those red smooth cheeks, that raiment light and airy,
Better indeed than seemed to quite comport
With rightly balancing Shop versus Sport.
And what has Babylon with Sport to do?
Woods hath it none, the fields from it are far gone;
Thence sallies forth no spear-armed hunting crew
Circling the chariot of some modern Sargon.
And yet from Euston Square to Waterloo,
From TATTERSALL's to tavern-bars, its jargon
Is all-familiar to the lips and ears
Of cits and costers, publicans and Peers.
Sport call they it, the “Sport of Kings" forsooth!
When rascalry is royal, fever festive,
The phrase may bear some touch of solid truth,
Now Reason at the hackneyed rot grows restive.
Pale greed-pinched faces of our Golden Youth
Of kingly sportiveness are scarce suggestive,
And old Lord SNAFFLE, “waiting for a taker,"
Might sit for Bunyan's grovelling Muck-raker.
Its spell is o'er the Town, its sordid spell.
It sways men's minds from squalid Seven Dials
To smug Cheapside and cynical Pall Mall,
Slang-motlied talk of tips, and touts, and trials,
Absorbs the kindred souls of snob and swell;
Statesmen must plunge though War vent all its vials,
And wits would leave a Supper of the Gods
To spot a winner, or consult the odds.
At TATTERSALL's or the Victoria, greed
May wear a smarter garb, a smugger grace,
Than 'midst the ragged raffs who crush to read
The earliest record of the latest race
On Fleet's foul pavement; but the fires that feed
The vagrant's veins, and flush his harpy face,
Burn in the breasts of Bondsmen of the Pen,
Club-Swells and Clerks, Nobles and Business Men!
BAZZARD beneath his broadcloth felt their flame
In ever-growing force; the “modest flutter"
In Trade's slack intervals grew all too tame;
The “Shop” seemed tedious, mere dull bread-and-butter
Dully acquired: he'd fly at higher game-
His luck was good, his failure seldom utter;
So brooded BAZZARD, and if spur or whip
His purpose needed, there was SIMON FEIP!
If BAZZARD found the “brass," and Flip the “brains,"
The Business Man was not allowed to guess
That tacit bargain, vanity so reigns
In self-dubbed oracles of knowingness,
That BAZZARD might have huffed. Put their joint gains
Swelled, and the Cit swelled also, with success.
Until-he burst, as vulgar windbags do,
Floored by the failure of one last grand coup !
Poor Business Man! Where was his sharpness now,
His cynic coolness, and his noisy cheer?
“The veriest cocktail !” FLIP declared ; his brow
Damp with despair, his mouth awry with fear!
FLIP never turned a hair, SIMON somehow
Avoided quarters in the street called Queer;
But BAZZARD, poor struck gull, was bound to drop,
Tumbled 'twixt the two stools of Sport and Shop.
The latter no more knew him, and no more
The Rookery's paths re-echoed his sharp tread.
A stranded wreck on Speculation's shore,
He lay, a derelict. Toadies he had fed
At many a feast, from young Lord BLUNDERBORE
To faithless FLIP himself, all cut him dead,
Aye! even the blatant, coarse Bookmaking crew
Who flock and feed at fusty Waterloo !
Years later, on a chill September day,
A dull suburban race-course echoed loud
To one despairing shriek. What furious fray
Whirls, like some human Maelström, that mad crowd ?
Tossed hither, thither like a ball in play,
Struck, torn at, garment-rent, pale, crimson-browed,
A hunted wretch in abject terror fled,
Gasped forth a fruitless prayer, and dropped as dead.
The cur-crowd, tiger-hearted, smote and thrust-
A man-hunt, when so safe, 'is sport most rare ! -
Trampled the battered body in the dust,
With broken limbs, eyes blinded, limp, half bare.
A hideous sight! The brute-mob's bestial lust
Of cruelty found demonstration there;
There were displayed the civilising sort
Of influences which move the World of Sport !
It was the Business Man! Poor broken knave!
Torn like some stricken wolf by his own pack!
Half that mad throng, so prompt with stone and stave
Were rogues than BAZZARD's self more base and black,
Though in defence of lawless law so brave.
The dread cry, “ Welsher!” on the victim's track
That ruthless horde of race-course curs let slip,
And he who raised the cry was-SIMON FLIP!

or arsenals that had escaped his notice the last time he
was in the neighbourhood. This seems a happy solution
of the difficulty, as, if successful, it will calm French
susceptibilities, and need not, of course, be regarded by
the Chinese for a moment in the light of an actus belli.
SHANGHAI, Sept. 17.
Have just met the Chinese Commissioner. He tells
me he has received a despatch from Pekin, acquainting
him with the third successful blowing up of the Ski-hi
forts by the French, including the new garrison of fifteen
thousand men. He laughed heartily at the incident,
remarking, as we concluded our conversation, “If
Frenchee man blowee up Chin-chin-Chinee man, and
makee peacey, why not Chin-chin-Chinee man skinee
everybody allee-roundee, and makee-peacey too ?”
There is really something in this, though I only repeat
it for what it is worth. Still, I think I shall endeavour
to get out of Shanghai this afternoon as a stowaway on
one of the out-going packets, for I hear the Sub-Assistant
Secretary to the New European Club here was found
this morning rather maliciously nailed to his own notice-
board. Indeed, as I write, the Committee are barricaded
within the building, and determined, so I am told, to
fight to the death rather than give up their prized French
Chef, the very best on the coast, to an angry mob, who are
raving outside for his eyeballs and thumbs to send to Pekin,
on the as yet quite unsupported plea that in violation
of the treaties of '63 and '71, he has boiled down a yellow-
buttoned Mandarin in the stock used in the establish-
ment for the lighter spring-soups. The Oriental mind is
easily impressed with a picturesque story of this kind,
and though I should say from what I know of the Com-
mittee personally that it is perfectly unfounded, yet
there are times when feeling unfortunately runs high, and
in case there should be some sort of basis for the canard,
perhaps I had better get a little nearer Hong Kong.
SHANGHAI, Sept. 17.
Curiously on my way to the landing-stage, on all-
fours, carefully disguised as a Chinese General of the
second rank, I met LI-TUNG-STING, who explained to me
that order was perfectly restored, and that there was
not the slightest occasion now for my departure. An

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TOWN.
No. XIV.–NOBODY IN Town. A PARABLE.
He stood upon the bridge which spans the stream
Of ancient Thames where thick its turbid flood
Flows at its fullest, where the banshee scream
Of Science's shrill bantling chills the blood;
EW
There where the rhetorician's oft-told dream,
Pictures, 'midst shattered London's solitude,
The dusky wanderer from his distant home,
Sketching the ruined wreck of WREN's great dome.
No savage he, a Stranger come from far,
Whence boots it not more closely to inquire.
Suppose him wafted from some happier star,
Or planet, purged by purgatorial fire
From bonds of the Preposterous, bonds which are
Town's incubus, and heart and brain so tire ;-
At least, in cases where the brain and heart
In the Town-dweller's programme play a part.
A Voice was in his ear, a vague strange Voice,
Low yet soul-moving, like the far-heard sound
Of multitudes who clamour or rejoice.
The Wanderer started, and looked keenly round.
“Would you, Sir Stranger, of a Guide make choice,
To show you London's maze from bound to bound?
I'm at your service for the onerous task,
And trustier cicerone none could ask.”
A Figure faintly outlined as a ghost,
Articulate yet of speech, and firm of tread;
No vagrant phantom from the Stygian coast,
No shadow from the regions of the dead.
“Agreed! I'll test your amicable boast.
Lead on, I follow, Sir!" the Stranger said.
And stride for stride the pair passed swiftly on,
Through the thronged ways of Cockney Babylon.
“ Time ill-selected, friend !” the Figure muttered,
With a slow smile most quietly sardonic.
“Why?" quoth the Stranger, nothing moved or fluttered ;
His glance was watchful and his speech laconic.
“ Vast, multi-spired, thick-roof'd and many-gutter'd
Is London,” said his Guide; “but fate's ironic
To send you here in Autumn Eh? The reason?
Why this, you see, is not the London Season !”
The Stranger gazed around. Lord NELSON's lions
Looked still and statuesque, but all beside
Seemed thronging tumult, pauseless as Ixion's
Eternal wheel that ever-flowing tide.
“Oh! these are not our Joves and our Orions-
Rulers and hunters,"—chuckled that grim Guide.
“St. Stephen's there, is void ; wealth, wit, and worth,
Leaving the West a waste, have fled due North !”
“A Wilderness !” the Stranger mused. “I know
Sand waste and rocky solitude too well
To grant this such." The Figure answered, “Lo!
The unpeopled desert Fashion calls Pall-Mall!
Persepolis is scarce more still, more slow.'
Ask yonder furtive solitary Swell,
Who seeks his Club, like some lone eremite
Crawling toward his cave at fall of night.
“ Park Lane's a long parade of blinds, the Squares
Are silent, and the Row's a soundless sweep;
A hoof that wakes the echoes unawares
Startles the ear; the shadows seem to sleep
Athwart the Ride. Society's London wears
An air of death. The herd that sought the steep
In Gadara, than London's mob polite
Were less gregariously swift of flight.
" The Town is out of Town.' Lady ASTARTE
At Trouville bathes, Lord MOTH's at Monaco,
St. Stephen's scatters with enjoyment hearty
Where grouse-moors spread or where swift trout-streams
flow.
There's nothing now, nor Court, nor Garden Party,
Opera, Coaching-meet, or Picture Show,
To invest our urban life with true urbanity,
Or Town redeem from being void as-Vanity!”
“ Vanity!” smiled the Stranger. “Word ill-chosen,
Or cruelly ironic !-which you will.
Empty? No doubt, of some few hundred dozen
Gay birds of passage, but the millions still
Here toil, think, suffer, riot, huckster, cozen.
Vanity's fled, perchance, to moor, loch, hill.
And when afar the light-winged trifler flutters
Its City Fair may haply close its shutters.
" But from Sahara one poor handful taken
Is nothing missed amidst the sand-waste vast!”
His Guide's mysterious shape seemed strangely shaken,
His shadowy hands were spectrally upcast.
“How soon,” cried he, “unbiassed wits awaken
To custom-hidden truth! By one big blast
Were all earth's butterflies to limbo hurled,
The bees and beetles yet would make a world.
“I know the Town, I know its throngs, I know
Its endless streets, and their unceasing labour,
Its brain-racked money-gatherers, high or low,
Proud Wealth, and Poverty its clinging neighbour.
The courtly painter's dream of belle and beau
Prancing to Pan-pipe and to pastoral tabor,
Is less preposterous than the smug unreason
Of JENKINS twaddling on the London Season.
“ Its fleeting follies fill his shallow eye,
Absorb his toady soul; but Court and Crush,
The Row, the Drive, the Game, the Gallery,
The Show where Coaches meet or Roses blush,
The Season's round of small stale pageantry,
Its pallid boredom and its fevered Hush,
Are as the foam upon the breaking wave,
To Ocean's floods that half the round world lave.
“ Life's tide in London flows, unhalting, on.
There SENEX strides, St. Stephen's brightest star,
There SHADRACH, Midas of our Babylon
Save for the ass's ears; there NENUPHAR,
Eye-witching Actress; there great VIBRION,
"Biology's last oracle ; ETTARRE,
A Queen of Beauty proved-if not of Truth-
In Tennysonian Tournament of Youth.'
“ Yon sleek dwarf silver-haired, Silenus-faced,
Is GRIP, the rich and ruthless Money-lender.
There's MIRABEL, the Journalist well-graced
With scholarship, of touch so light and tender
On Mayfair's lute; there, striding as though chased
By the Eumenides goes LOVELACE, sender
Of many a broken heart and shame-bowed head
Down to the ranks of the dishonoured dead.
“ I know them all, I know the threadbare throngs
That surge around them; drudges, martyrs, slaves,
Pale victims of trade, greed, and social wrongs,
_Street sirens, penmen poor, and petty knaves.
To a new volume of Society Songs
My muse might add some unexpected staves.
Great Heavens, yes ! did Truth dare speak aloud
In Fashion's ear the Voices of the Crowd!”
His utterance swelled, it seemed the far-heard roar
Of distant seas tumultuous. “Who art thou ?"
The Stranger cried, and turned to read once more
Those eyes deep-glowing and that shadowy brow.
Only a voice came back, a voice that bore
Meaning immeasurable, sardonic, slow
From the void darkness vaguely whispering down
“I'm NOBODY, and I am stil ' in Town!!"

MODERN EDUCATION.
A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE.
SIR,—While sojourning in the village of Tyler's Hill, I came
across, in the Visitors' Book of the hotel, this statement, “The beer
is beestly, F. SMITH.” Curiously enough, I was at school in 1839
with an F. SMITH, whom I have not seen since, and the above state-
ment so reminded me of his concise and clear-headed language, and
the spelling of “beestly" so suggested his performances in Dictation
Class, that I feel convinced that the F. SMITH of my schooldays and
the F. SMITH of the Visitors' Book are one and the same man. The
coincidence seemed to me so curious that I determined to write this
to you, and its insertion is certain to please many who, like myself,

EXTORTIONATE CHARGES.
SIR, I have a real grievance to lay before you. I am a man of
sedentary habits, and am most particularly averse to walking exer-
cise, yet the other day I was persuaded to ascend Snowdon on
foot. On arrival at the summit, I was naturally thirsty, and
refreshed myself with a bottle of beer. For that I was charged the
enormous price of eighteenpence. Now, in the name of common
sense, do the proprietors of Snowdon think they are going to induce

A “MASTER OF THE SENTENCES.”
SIR HENRY HAWKINS gave two most
justly severe sentences last week. Let us
hope they will be deterrent. The first was
of ten years penal servitude passed on
HENRY PHILLIPS for attempting to extort
money by threatening the victim with an
accusation of crime, and the other was
passed on two professional and determined
burglars, whose capture was effected through
the pluck of one man, single-handed, Con-
stable GARNER, of the G Division, 429, one
of whom got a “lifer," and the other twenty
years penal servitude.
A fact worth noting is how many of these
burglaries with violence, and, for the matter
of that, how many other crimes as well, are
committed by ticket-of-leave men. Does
the system answer? In what proportion
does it succeed? Can such men as WRIGHT
and WHEATLEY ever be set at liberty again?
If they can be reclaimed, then, when re-
claimed, let them spend a penitential life
in Prison, where the discipline might be
relaxed, but where there would be no temp-
tation to burgle and revolverise, no diffi-
culty in obtaining employment, and where
“Police supervision," so intolerable to the

than otherwise, the Warders coming to be

There is to be another burlesque on Called Back, written by
Mr. HERMAN MERIVALE, with the sanction of Mr. COMYNS CARR,
who assisted Mr. Hugh Conway in the other dramatio version of
his book at the Princess's. Very kind of Mr. COMENS CARR. But
of what possible use could Mr. CARR'S “sanction” be to Mr. MERI-
VALE? Did Mr. CARR select the portions of Mr. Hugh CONWAY'S
work that he particularly wished to be burlesqued? However,
these amenities are nice, and show there is no ill feeling. Mr.
YARDLEY, the Cricketer, had a shy at it some time since at the
Novelty, and, for ourselves, we don't believe in the subject. .
The serious Authors are all going in to forestall the Parodist, and,
among others, Mr. HERMAN (not MERIVALE, or VEZIN, but HENRY
HERMAN, Mr. Jones's partner and joint author of WILSON BARRETT,
and other successes), it is said, is going to write a Burlesque of his
next Drama. Capital idea! Only won't it rather bother the public,
which will be inquiring, like the boy at the Peepshow, “Please, Sir,
which is the Drama, and which is the Burlesque?” And Mr.
HERMAN may aptly reply, “Whichever you please, my little dear-

THE DEAR LITTLE HINNERCENT Things !"
[And so say all of us !
PAYING THE PIPERS.
(A new Tune on a Theme borrowed from the “ Bab Ballads.")
O Wuliam E. McMERRYPEBBLE the Gran'
Was a hard-working, eloquent, elderly man.
To call himself Scotch was his greatest delight,
And perhaps on the whole the old Piper was right.
From the fol-de-rol Forth to the whatsit Deeside,
Round by thingummy Tay and by rum-te-tum Clyde,
There wasn't a Piper, at base or at treble,
The equal of WILLIAM E. McMERRYPEBBLE.
No other could wake such remarkable tones
From anything, down from the “bags” to the “bones."
But he seemed at his best when delighting Scotch chiels
With blood-stirring slogans, and pibrochs, and reels.
He'd climb on a carriage, a platform, a mound,
And the neighbours in thousands would gather around
To list to his pipes and to gaze in his een,
In Midlothian's Heart and in far Aberdeen.
All loved WILLIAM E., save a Sassenach gent
Who followed his steps with a rival's intent.
He had got himself up like a Piper, you ’ll note,
And his name it was BOREAS STUFFEM SHEEPSCOTE,
SHEEPSCOTE had incurred a prodigious expense
To look like a Scotchman in every sense ;
But this is a matter most people will own
That isn't a question of costume alone.
SHEEPSCOTE was sufficiently bonily built,
He purchased a sporran, a bonnet, a kilt,
Stuck a skeän in his hose, was a zebra for stripes,
But he turned out a very poor hand at the pipes.
The pipings of McMERRYPEBBLE would float
To the frenzy of BOREAS STUFFEM SHEEPSCOTE.
The Scots were amused at the Sassenach's spleen,
In Midlothian's Heart as in fair Aberdeen.
“My McMERRYPEBBLE, and SHEEPSCOTE my lad,
Your competitive shindies are driving me mad!
If both of you must play on that noisy affair,
I do wish to goodness you'd play the same air."
Now this was the voice of a Sassenach, BULL,
Who found the whole business was noisy and dull.
And when two angry pipers play different reels,
The thing grows too much à la WAGNER, one feels.
Moreover a third one, one SOURBERRY, came
With the purpose of playing the same little game;
And the Sassenach thought, “ When he mingles his tones,
Oh, shan't I be sick of the bag and the drones!”
So the fidgety Sassenach up and he swore
He'd listen no longer, he'd stand it no more ;
And addressing the Pipers-perhaps in bad taste-
He spake to them thus, in his heat and his haste:
“Oh, blow your three bagpipes! Or rather, perhaps,
I should say do not blow them again-there's good chaps !
Your tunes may be fine-though I'm dashed if they're sweet.
But I wish, my dear fellows, you'd-try the next street!
“The pibroch, I'm told, sounds so pleasant-afar.
'Tis I ‘pay the Pipers,' 'wherever they are ;
But if near my doors you again should upstrike,
I may pay you all round-in a coin you won't like!”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TOWN.
No. XV.-A STORY OF A SLUM.
Not here the moony, chill, electric glare
Irradiates showy shops and spacious flags,
But naphtha cressets foully fume and flare
O'er faces pale and forms in frowzy rags.
A roar of huckster patter fills the air,
And troops of slipshod girls and shambling
hags,
With eager, ape-like faces, crush and crowd,
For orts and offal chaffering shrill and loud.
“Buy! Buy!”
The stentor chorus cleaves the
night, like mockery woman, wala a though 11
Greeting like mockery many an eager ear.
My Buy? See yon draggled woman, wan and white !
"Buy! Buy!” Close-clutched in one thin hand, as though in
fear,
She holds some scanty pence, intent her sight
Glares gloatingly on spreads of coarse good cheer,
Shamble-like shows of ruddy flesh, huge heaps
Of sodden fish, whereat taste shrinks and creeps.
She had it once, wealth's daintier palate. Now
The howling hawker's piles of finny waste,
That scent not of the sea, bring zest's faint glow
To her pinched pallid cheeks; with feverish haste
She makes her petty bid, then turns to go.
What has pale Poverty to do with taste ?
Her husband, hunger-stricken, lies alone,
And scarce would spurn the beggar's thrice-picked bone.
An Oxford man, slack-willed, of sinew stout,
Some scholarship, and a besetting taste
For Town's enticements. CARFAX feigned to flout
The Cockney Circe, vulgar as unchaste,
Yet in her lap poured prodigally out
His patrimony in unmeasured waste.
Circe, kite-keen, insatiate as the vulture,
Ranks 'midst her choicest fools the fool of Culture.
Culture! The latest, vaguest nebulosity
In Cant's vocabulary! Pedants prate
And poets pipe of it, but curiosity
May vainly call on them to plainly state
Its nature and effects ; priggish pomposity
And maundering hysteria nothing hate
So heartily as keen and close analysis,
Which to their proud pretensions brings paralysis.
One thing is clear ; the Culture of the Clique
For moral health or strength yields small security,
Or would BOYLE SMYTHE Art-charm in sickness seek,
And LIMPET lave in lyrical impurity ?
Poor CARFAX! Culture left him smoothly weak,
A specimen of polished immaturity,
Such as the Town is rich in; ready math
For the grim warder of the primrose path!
Avernus is so facile of descent
To such unwary loiterers on its slope !
CARFAX lounged on, on easy joys intent,
Yet dallying dreamily with higher hope.
But when disaster struck reed-like he bent;
Emasculate, unstrung, how should he cope
With frowning fate, whose swift and sudden flood
Tries men of steadiest nerve and sternest blood ?
Why trace the dread dégringolade? A theme
For ruthless Realism's iron pen!
The faint last rays of folly's roseate dream
Died to dull grey at fact's chill touch-and then
The polished pluckless fool on trouble's stream
Down drifted hopelessly. The waifs-called men
By courtesy-who play this “nithing's” part,
Find their last rampart in a woman's heart,
Poor soul! He took her from a formal home
In opulent Philistia, witched her fancy
With superficial charm she thought must come
From soul-deep sources,-easy necromancy!
So from suburban villadom to slum
He dragged her down, his "blue-eyed, pure-lipped Pansy,"
As he had called her in the effusive days
Of Passion's heat and Culture's wordy craze.
Heart's-ease no more! That flower could hardly flourish
In Ragman's Rents, where not a grass-spear dared
Uprear its valorous point. CARFAX grew currish,
As shallow natures do when struck or snared
By Nemesis, nor patient hope could nourish,
Nor manly effort make. She slaved, pinched, spared,
Petitioned, pawned, scraped scanty pence by shifts
Whence Poverty's shame the veil but seldom lifts.
A ZOLA, gentler and less gross, might paint
True pictures of the poor which, shocking less,
Much more might move. This woman frail and faint
Chaffering for that cheap pile of nastiness,
More than a moon-faced medieval Saint
Stirs unsophisticated hearts. The stress
Of sordid sorrow in the reeking slum
Might strike your neo-pagan pessimist dumb.
“PANSY!” That voice in the pale woman's ear
Makes her strained senses reel, the gas flames flit
Before her eyes; she crouches as with fear.
The speaker is a well-paunched pursy Cit,
Half-breathless, white, her father. “Oh! you here!”
She stammers forth; and then the cynic wit
That thrives in slums as well as clubs, hath food
Seldom vouchsafed in this low neighbourhood.
A draggled chafferer for unwholesome scraps
Hanging about a broad-clothed "Swell's.” bowed neck!
Grotesque! a sight to make grave Nestor's chaps
Wag mirthfully! Yet little do they reck.
He's hard on poverty as on moral lapse,
His smug respectability knows no speck
More than his shirt-front, - but this den !-his daughter !-
No, even Philistia's blood' is not all water.
He follows her with shocked and shuddering nerves,
The rookery's slimy slopes seem like descents
To some Town Tophet. Sin of course deserves
To suffer,-but this filth! “Eh? Ragman's Rents ?"
The self-poised Money-gatherer starts and swerves.
Better with Tartar hordes in smoke-fouled tents
To huddle than in this malodorous hell,
Which is his property,-and pays so well!
What spectral skulking Pariahs, furtive shapes
Which like mute jackals glide amidst the shadows,
Show in the gas-flare through the dusk that drapes
Sin's nameless dens else dark as Dis's meadows!
This gulf-like hole that like Gehenna gapes,
Can it be one of Town's new El Dorados
Where Land, Church, Commerce in our huckster time
Fatten on filth and misery, shame and crime ?
On through a shattered entry, up a flight
Of tortuous stairs into a narrow room
Noisome and dim as the Swamp-demon's night!
A candle's flickering spark gleams through the gloom.
The sleek Cit shivers. 'Tis a sickening sight.
This culture's fate, this the proud athlete's doom,
Shared by the once bright beauty laying now
A shrunken hand on that wan sleeper's brow?
A start, a shuddering cry, a forward fall
Across that rag-screened breast, and prone she lies.
Poor shaken Cit! What should he do ? A call
Might summon-what? With trembling hands and eyes
Helplessly wide he stands, sheer horror's thrall.
"Pansy! dear Pansy!” – Long resentment dies
In that stiff Philistine's paternal breast
Unsteeled against this cruel crowning test.
Silence! A broken glass, the sickly fume
Of rank raw spirit tell their obvious tale.
Drunken, though hungering! Well-deserved his doom,
Philistia thinks. But now to rouse the pale
Prone form, to bear her from this pestilent room.
Alas, good Cit! your wealth will nought avail,
Nay, nor your love, to lift that fallen head
To life and hope again. Those two are dead !

And the Field records my name.

The Livery and the Aldermen have made a wise choice.
It may be considered audacious in me to give an opinion.
But perhaps few persons have so excellent a means of
judging of the Members of the Corporation as I have.
I am always there. Lord Mayors may come, and Lord
Mayors may go, but I stay on for ever, as the poet says,
My practised eye can judge of a man's points by his
manner of entering the sacred precinots of Guildhall, as
well ; as the State Coachman can judge of a horse's
points by seeing him take his gallop. Some members
of the Court of Aldermen enter the Hall in a hurry.
That's a great mistake, and I put them down one black
mark. Some look on the ground, as if they were looking
for some lost treasure-that's a bad sign. Some, on
the other hand, look straight ahead, and never conde-
soend to notice a poor Beadle. That's very bad form,
that is. The Alderman, for my money, comes in smiling
and good-tempered, is in no particular hurry, and always
has a kindly nod or even a kindly word for an old
servant.
Just the same with the Common Councilmen, though
why common I never could understand, for, as Romeo
says, or might have said, a Common Councilman by any
other name would smell as sweet, but I sometimes think
I could write sketches of some of the uncommonest of

The Last Meeting of the Court of Common Council in
their Old Council Chamber," which took place on
Thursday last. Whether it was quite a wise thing to
make such a change just now, time and Sir WILLIAM
will show. It was a bold thing to do, but change begets
change, and the appetite feeds by what it grows apon.
And the change is great indeed. The old Chamber was
square, the new one is round. The old one was too
small, the new one is too large. The old one was hot,
the new one is cold. In the old one the LORD MAYOR

Of such as soar

As snob - souled

as smug-lipped
peers,
Napoleons or Car-
abas; a word
Blue blood will tlout with supercilious sneers,
Or did, till, by mutation most absurd,
Time's whirligig our slips of rank arrayed
As pillars in the temple-porch of Trade.
Now Trade's broad trail is over all the Town.
Once shunned as serpent-slime, it touches now,
Awaking searce a shudder or a frown,
The purple's hem, the ermine's skirt. The brow
That bears the strawberry leaves can scarce look down
On those who buy and sell. The Argo's prow
For honour ploughed the sunny seas of Greece,
But Commerce holds the modern Golden Fleece.
Young Jason now would seek the aureate prize
On Change or in Cheapside, and haply find
His Colchis in the marts of merchandise
That lurk Town's showier thoroughfares behind.
Rank's junior slip as junior partner tries
“Blood's" subtle influence on the snobbish mind,
Or sucks sweet gain, with fellow Swells in scores,
From Shopdom's apotheosis—"The Stores.”
Though Nature brings not back the Mastodon,
Man loves the Mammoth fashion ; monster bulks
Bewitch his fancy. Trade on Pelion
Would Ossa pile. The heir of the Fitz-FULKES
Must not mete silks like JONES or ROBINSON,
Yet Swelldom in the train of Shopdom skulks,
And he who'd scorn the counter-jumper's antic,
Would share Shop's spoil, if but the scale 's gigantic.
From the small chandler of the Town's back street
To the Colossal Caterer omnivending,
Whose long-drawn lines of glittering frontage greet
Villadom's view in vistas nigh unending,
Seems a far flight; yet FLINTWIT's plodding feet
Have compassed it; his soul astute, unbending,
Fitted him well Trade's latest war to wage,
The huckster-Alexander of his age.
Not state to state, nor field to field adds he,
But shop to shop. A conquest bloodless, blameless,
Of course. The foeman of the poor and free
Is Mars, not Mammon! Who so sour, so shameless,
As to suggest that FLINTWIT's energy,
His enterprise astute, his ardour tameless,
Show aught in common with the ruthless tyrant
'Gainst whom Tyrtaan bards with splendid ire rant ?
A SULLA of the Shop, a Trade TIBERIUS,
Only satiric licence dares conceive.
FLINTWIT, 'tis true, is rocky, cold, imperious,
Ask the pinched boys and pallid slips of Eve
Who toil long hours at duties deleterious
To health and heart, his fortune's web to weave.
But can Leviathan heed Lilliput's wishes ?
The whale consult the weal of little fishes ?
Still the Colossal claims its holocaust
As in the days of CHEOPS, pyramid
Or huge emporium, Egypt's age-long boast,
Or London's vast Trade labyrinths! Stand and bid
The storm-flood spare the flower, the locust host
Pass the poor cotter's crop, then seek to rid
The little folk of Labour from the blight
Of Mammoth Mammonism's ruthless might.
FLINTWIT has risen on the toil-bowed necks
Of plodding legions sternly drilled to serve
The strong, shrewd selfishness that nothing recks
Of weakling weariness, that will not swerve
For any tender thought of age or sex.
His course, clear-ordered as the comet's curve,
Is no more checked than storm or cataclysm
By any scruples born of altruism.
The ethics of the Shop find little place
For that mild idol of the theorists.
The Devil take the hindmost in wealth's race
Is FLINTWIT's maxim. Soft sophistic twists
Turn not his steps from seeking the first place
By any course that climbing skill assists.
Shopdom is proof against that strange insanity
Called the Enthusiasm of Humanity ?
Humanity ? FLINTWIT's iron discipline
Deals with frail women as the Corsican
Dealt with battalions. They may pale and pine
Through long-drawn hours, limb-racked, and faint, and wan,
Lynx-watched and harried. What if they incline
'Wildly to Shame's escape, and swell the clan
Of painted Perditas? The Town's supply
Of souls to wreck will never slack or dry.
Humanity ? FLINTWIT's frown at light infraction
Of Shopdom's rigid self-regarding rule
Strikes boyish culprits to dumb stupefaction.
The beardless bondsman of the desk or stool
May miss a penny, munch a pear, the action
Brings prompt discharge, perchance arrest. Sweet school
For the mild equities and gentler graces
The giant haunt of hucksters in high places !
FLINTWIT, a petty trader in his time,
Would sink a fleet of Trade's small cockboats now
To float his Argosy, nor deem it crime.
Supple and sinuous, with dust-grovelling brow
Whilst worming upwards, now erect, sublime
He tramples where he crawled. Dared he avow
The past's law-dodging tricks true taste would shrink,
But law and taste at wealth-crowned knaves can wink.
Such Shopdom in excelsis ! Town's blue blood
Must curdle at its contact,-can one doubt it?
The pride of the Fitz-FULKES in feudal mood
Bend to the bagman's bait, do ought but flout it?
Absurd ! Yet Trade's Tom Tiddler's ground's so good,
And if Rank's stragglers linger round about it,
What marvel they are drawn, ensnared, nor stop.
Till FULKES with FLINTWITS share the taint of Shop ?
“Shop!” As the Babylonish garment cursed
Poor ACHAN, so the Nessus-shirt of greed
Clings like a curse to Babylon. So are nursed
Town's sordid vices, so its victims bleed.
Though the sword smite not now, the swollen-pursed
Suck, vampire-like, the hearts that faint to feed
The Insatiate, sacrificed to cramming thus
The Moloch maw of the new Succubus.
Taint of the Trading City spreading wide
From Chepe to proud Mayfair! Acoursed thing
That lifts cad 'cuteness, lowers patrician pride,
The Store's stiff tyrants, the low Hebrew ring
Levels at last! Greed greets on every side
The labouring Muse who London's maze would sing.
Mammon, that raised it, rings the curtain down
Upon the long-drawn drama of the Town!

But now they hint he's growing old and toothless,

And grown so vastly fond of forty-winking

Tries rousing prods and pokes in vast variety,
And endless number.
He pulls old LEO's mane, he tweaks his tail,
And, gaining courage as these insults fail,
Concludes, no doubt,
That nothing LEO's stagnant blood will quicken,
That he has but to treat him like a chicken,
And wh-0-0-osh him out.

MANCHESTER’S PLUCKY AUDITOR!
We have so long been accustomed to hear of the won-
drous doings of Manchester the Great, and what a grand
example she sets to the rest of the Kingdom in all that
constitutes good and pure government and sound finance,
that we confess to a slight feeling of gratification, as well
as a large amount of amusement, on reading the amazing
report of their “Citizens' Auditor," as he is called, a copy
of which has been forwarded to us.
A proper audit is, of course, the real test of a proper
account, and an audit of the accounts of such a Corpora-
tion as that of Manchester would, one would think, be as
dull and uninteresting as a last month's Bradshaw. Let
us see if this be the case. We will take our extracts quite

railway-platforms. That is not a safe sort of platform for the pur-
pose of political meetings; and if it is undesirable that a public
speaker should always speak within door, it may be wished that he
should seldom, except of necessity, deliver orations with his head out
of window. Particularly since, in this variable climate, the most
valuable head, with the bump of “Veneration” upon it, under the
influence of that sentiment, in reverence of a popular assembly,

be useful to some of our young Actors :-
TRAVELLER.-WANTED, a young Gentleman to represent an ivory
1 button manufacturer in London, and occasionally take country
journeys.-Full particulars, stating age, experience, and salary required.
This certainly opens quite a new line of character-parts. We should
like to see Mr. ARTHUR CECIL represent “an ivory button manu-
facturer in London.” There would be, we are certain, a delightful
freshness and finish about the performance. We should like also to
see the notion of " pearl shirt-stud maker in Leeds," or "a sleeve-
link fabricator at Liverpool,” or any other little trifle that this new
departure may suggest.

VALE!
A Fond Farewell to the Seasonable Summer of 'Eighty-Four.
WITH a sunny burst that British bosoms cheered,
You appeared,
And bewitched us with a true old English May,
Sunny hours and skies of blue,
And its promise was more true
Than the promise of our Poet Laureate's play.
We had fancied that the Summer of old song
Had gone wrong,
Had, like Cheshire Cheese and Ribstone Pippins, fled ;
And that never any more,
On the sea or on the shore,
Should we see you who, like mighty Pan, was dead.
We had had so many dismal Junes, you know,
Čold as snow,
And Julys the sheer antipodes of HERRICK'S;
And we gave ourselves up wholly
To goloshes, melancholy,
Long-tailed waterproofs, and lyrical hysterics.
But your June was just the June of auld lang syne,
Warm and fine,
And your July sunny SUCKLING might have sung.
Scarce a deluge or a raw gust
Marred the beauty of your August,
And you gladdened youth, and made the old feel young.
Oh! to sing a song of Summers such as this
Is pure bliss
(And may we often have a chance to sing 'em);
We were free of slop and slosh,
Of the mucky mackintosh,
And that autocrat of latter days, the gingham !

And one's nose

that the muffin is not toasted too much. It is a task I never leave to

and, adapting his original and striking phrase, which had made such
an effect in the House, exclaimed-
“Enlevez La Bourboule !” and hoped to see the town razed to the
ground. It wasn't, however, as La Bourboule is gifted with ever-
lasting youth, or at least with a perpetual Spring.

SPICER thinks he will go out and make a sketch of La Bourboule.
He takes a small portfolio under his arm. Being the only stranger
visible, his movements attract attention. Nobody is doing anything
at La Bourboule now, and_the news soon spreads about that an
Englishman-an eccentric Englishman-is absolutely going out to
amuse himself. How he will set about it is a matter of the intensest
curiosity to the crowd, who for the first time in their experience

which serves as a water-course in Winter, at full galop, without a

doesn't know what the waters are doing to him, but he is of opinion
that they're all humbug; and he reminds me that it was I who in-

the Gentleman whose name is Easy, as he strokes his nose re-

(Adapted from Dibdin to the sad Circum-

'Twas Prime Meridian, twelve at noon,
By signal I from Nancy parted;
At eight she watched the rising moon,
With wringing hands, half broken-
hearted.
At nine, while tantening the fore-stay,
I saw her faint, unless 'twas fancy;
At ten we all got under weigh,
And bade a long adieu to NANCY !
Night came. The theme of every tongue
Was the Meridian Conference. Weary
Of that at last, we piped and sung,
And chawed our quids in confab cheery;
But something weighed upon my mind,
The wildest dreams possessed my fancy,
And fate seemed whispering on the wind,
I ne'er again should meet my NANCY!
And now arrived the happy time
Which every true Tar's spirit rouses,
When safe at home (Meridian Prime)
We hoped to meet sweethearts and
spouses.
But round and round the world went we,
Seeking that Prime Meridian! Fancy !
The darned thing wasn't fixed, ye see,
And I could not find home or NANCY!
It was, of course, the beastliest bore.
Those stupid Frenchmen had a notion
That fixing it on England's shore,-
England, whose vessels scour the ocean,
And who is owned to rule the waves,
Insulted France ! A foolish fancy!
The vanity to which they're slaves
Fooled them-and kept me from my

A MEDICAL HERO.
[Dr. RABBETH, of the Royal Free Hospital, has just died after endeavouring
to save the life of a child suffering from diphtheria. Tracheotomy was per
formed, but the obstruction in the throat could not be removed without
suction of the tube which had been passed into the windpipe. Dr. RABBETH,
knowing the risks, at once sucked the tube, temporarily relieving the patient,
which however died, but he succumbed a few days afterwards to the same
disease. He was only in his twenty-eighth year. ]
THEY tell us of the heroes of old days,
Of men who struggled through the roar of fight,
When villanous saltpetre made day night,
And kings and awestruck people stood at gaze.
Ours is a hero who must win your praise
For strange deed, yet heroic as all those
Done in the front of fierce conflicting foes,
Albeit he walked in humbler unknown ways,
He certes warred in no ignoble strife;
He gave a dying child his latest breath,
And nobly yielded up a noble life
In vain emprise to conquer certain death.
Be these the words on his memorial scroll :-
“He died for Science. Heaven rest his soul!"

To judge from Mr. DOYLY CARTE's fatherly Advertisement, his
Juvenile Opera Company, that is “to go on tour" after a few Christ-
mas Matinées at the Savoy, promises to be not only a very select
and agreeable, but even a very cultivated affair. The youthful
tourists-who, by the way, “must have been well brought up, and
of good manners," will, says Mr. DoyLY CARTE, with an outburst of
parental urbanity that almost obscures his fine English-"be well
cared for when travelling, being put under the care of a sufficient num-
ber of matrons for the girls, and respectable men to look after the boys."
Nor is this all. As a sort of clencher to any possible cavil as to
the perfect social fitness and propriety of the enterprise, the thought-
ful entrepreneur almost severely adds that “a certificated Master

The dogs of La Bourboule are another nuisance ; they bark and
they howl as no other dogs do, and are evidently irritated by the
children and the trumpets. Sometimes at night the owners of the
howling dogs are aroused, and then the noise is redoubled. But, if
you are snugly tucked up in bed, it is some consolation to reflect
that the dog is punished for howling, and that the master, who is
beating it, is probably catching a severe cold. When the toy-cow-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“Come in!” said the Editor, turning
round on his diamond-encrusted chair, and
throwing away a recently-lighted guinea
cigar. * What do you want?"
The question was put to a strange-looking
individual garbed in a long black cloak
which reached from his collars to his toes.
The Editor shuddered, and taking up a ten-
pound note, converted it into a spill, and
with it ignited another guinea cigar.
“You wish to know the details of the
Distribution Bill ?"
The Editor tried to laugh. But he felt
that it was true. He did wish to know
those details.
“ Then you shall. I come to you in a
spirit of bitter revenge. When I offered
the intelligence to your political rivals, I
was treated with contempt - contumely,
One said that he had no wish to learn the
secrets of his leader prematurely; that a
sale of an additional twenty millions of
copies would be no real compensation for a
wounded conscience. Another used language
worse than any I had ever read-even in a
leader complaining of the malpractices of
a political opponent. A third used personal
violence. So, hating your colleagues, I
come to you, their bitter rival, to offer you
the news they have rejected. But first let
me say that bribery is no element in this
arrangement. The printers and clerks are
as honest as the day. Still, a voluntary
contribution will not be disdained.
“Will this do?” asked the Editor,
scribbling off a cheque for six figures.
The Stranger smiled bitterly, but took
the stamped scrap of paper, and placed it in
his pocket.
"I see that you are businesslike, - you
know how to drive a hard bargain! But I
work for revenge-not for pelf.”
Then removing his black tail-coat (he was
wearing evening dress under his cloak), the
Stranger began to wave his hands and arms
above him in a peculiar fashion. After
a short pause the door opened, and a sturdy
old gentleman, in his shirtsleeves and car-
rying an axe, hurried in. He was quickly
followed by a ruddy-cheeked individual,
wearing a straw hat and holding a tele-
scope. Both stared stolidly in front of
them, apparently seeing nothing
“Mr. GLADSTONE, disturbed in his tree-
felling! My Lord' GRANVILLE, attracted
from Walmer!” murmured the Editor.
“Wait, and you shall see more," said
the Stranger, still waving his arms.
A fine-looking man, with his Lincoln-
and-Bennett tilted on to his nose, was the
next to come; then a sharp-looking person,
wearing an eyeglass and carrying a parcel
of screws; then eight or nine more.

the Editor.

“Just a penny a day !” said the portly-looking

"Just so,” said the unmoved Clerk. And the seedy-

Turning to me, the Clerk took my stamped shoot of
foolscap, and said, sharply, “ Take the book ?"
As the only book near me was a portly ledger, or
cash-book, or some such thing, of gigantic dimensions, I
naturally endeavoured to grasp that, when the cheerful-
looking Gentleman pointed, with a smile, to a small
volume in the corner, and I was sworn. Some strange
hieroglyphics were written on my sheet of foolscap, and
it was then returned to me, with the laconio instruction,
“Go back to the place from whence you came, and lodge

much like a portion of a sentence of death I once heard
passed at the Old Bailey, that a cold shudder passed
over me, which I fondly hope the portly Gentleman did
not notice. I then returned to the place from whence I

his hasty luncheon, and, taking a glance at my stamped
and sworn document, said, “That's all right. Now take
it down-stairs, third to the left and first to the right,

I descended accordingly, and entered a room in which
a rather juvenile Creditor was apparently seeking to
obtain advice where advice was not to be had. It was
in regard to what is called a Proxy. He had filled one
up, and handed it to a first-class-looking Clerk, who
threw it back, with the remark, “That won't do; it is
too general.”
“Will you kindly tell me," said the Juvenile Creditor,
“how to alter it?"
"I am not here to advise," said the Clerk, “but simply
to decide, and I decide that this won't do."
“What form should it assume ?” asked the Creditor.
“A special form and not a general," was the reply.

VERSES
Supposed to have been written by Salisbury Selkirk, during
his solitary abode in a Desert Chamber.
I AM monarch of all I survey ;
My facts there are none to dispute ;
I can sneer in my nastiest way,
And the Government Benches are mute.
Oh, why do I constantly sit '.
In this roofless and desolate house?
For the Peers have had “notice to quit,"
And 'tis left to the spider and mouse.
I am out of Democracy's reach,
My place the political shelf,
Never hear the sweet sound of a speech-
Except those I make to myself.
The policemen who haunt Palace Yard
My form with indifference see;
To a Marquis they pay no regard,
Which seems dreadfully "bad form” to me.
Ye joys of attack and defence,
And craft of the tongue and the brain,
Oh! had I had prudence and sense,
I soon might enjoy you again!
My sorrows I then might beguile
By assailing those Brummagem "Reds,"
Could rejoice in the wit of ARGYLL,
And tear DERBY's wisdom to shreds.
Oh, GRANVILLE! I wish I had known
What pleasure there lay in your talk,
Then I should not be pining alone
Where I once was the cock of the walk!
But the sound of the Lobby-going bell
These moth-eaten seats never hear,
Never fill at the voice of a "Swell,”
Or empty when dinner-time's near!

THE design of reducing the National Debt
Is a statesman-like purpose, which merits all praise ;
Though we mayn't reap the benetit of it just yet,
Till perhaps after many, a good many days.
But suppose that we don't, it will prove, of a verity,
An unspeakable blessing and boon to Posterity.
From Consols Three-per-Cent, cut down even to Two-

Whilst impoverished Fundholders come to sore grief-
Never mind, you'll have made an heroic exertion
In attempting the masterly scheme of conversion.
Still, however immensely important and great,
'Tis a matter not urgent, sooth strictly to say,
For a season, if need be, convenience can wait,
And stand over no worse for a term of delay;
To more pressing affairs if required to attend,
You have money to raise, and must borrow and spend.
There's our Navy, scarce up to the standard of France,
O my Lords, and then where in the world should we be
If a war at thé shortest of warning should chance,
And no longer we held the command of the Sea,

To confront allies banded, and face combination ?
For our food we depend upon sea-borne supplies,
Should want ships to secure them all over the main,
And our Colonies guard, and our commerce likewise,

For those purposes all could you cruisers commission ?
Have you Iron-clads enow in a fighting condition ?

Monday.-Busy day. In morning, send order for horsewhips, of
extra thickness, to firm of Hippopotamus-hide importers, and put
toes of iron-olad boots on grind-stone, in preparation for to-morrow's
Demonstration (so-called) by our opponents in favour of “Liberty of
the Subject." Called on my Parliamentary Employer, up back-
stairs. He deplored the prospect of a violent interference with the
Demonstration, and gave me five-pound note “for my starving little
ones." As I haven't got a family, don't quite know what he means.
Tuesday.- Capital idea in bed this morning. Place fifty coal-
heavers with bludgeons up their backs right in front of platform.
Up to mid-day engaged in forging tickets for the Demonstration.
Afternoon-try and slip half a sovereign into Chief Constable's hand,
to induce him to remove Police to other end of town. Threatens
to lock me up-and I tell him “it's only fun." In evening-
set off for “Liberty of Subject” Meeting. Question is, shall I
take my loaded cane, my six-shooter, or the patent explosive
dynamite crackers with me? Happy thought-take 'em all. I do.
Wednesday.- Head split open; splitting headache as result.
Exciting time of it last night. My dynamite crackers flying all
about platform, mark quite a new departure in politics. Their chief
speaker-Cabinet Minister, too - lost the sight of one eye, at all
events. That's something. Employer much pleased, but pretends not
to be. Deplores “outrage on public decency," and gives me another
fiver, for starving family, as before. Asks if my men are ready with
their affidavits to prove that the Right Honourable offered 'em a guinea
a-piece to assassinate our leaders. Must attend to this at once.
Thursday.--Some of my lambs are turning sheepish, and object to

"don't want to be put in quod for ten years." Give 'em something
for their starving families, and they think better of it.

Virtus in arduis! Valour against odds
That must have daunted courage less complete.
A spectacle to gladden men and meet
The calm approval of the gazing gods.
So some large singer of the heroic days
Might well have summed that life the fatal shears
Too soon have severed. Many fruitful years,
More conquests yet, still wider meed of praise,
All hoped for him who had good will of all,
The brave, the justly-balanced, calmly strong
Friend of all truth and foe of every wrong,
Who now, whilst lingering Autumn's last leaves fall
Falls death-touched suddenly far from the goal.
Too soon! too soon! if the stern stroke of fate
Ever too early falls or falls too late.
At least the passing of this clear strong soul
In fullest strength and clearness wakes lament.
We could have better spared a hundred loud,
Incontinent, blaring flatterers of the crowd
Than him, whose self-respecting years were spent
In silent thought and sense-directed toil,
Ungagged by greed, unshackled and unswayed
By sordid impulse of the sophist's trade,
By lies unsnared, and unseduced by spoil.
No braver conquest o'er ill-fortune's flout
Our age has seen than his who held straight on,
Though the great God-gift from his days was gone,
“And Wisdom at one entrance quite shut out,”-
Held on with genial stoutness, seeing more
Than men with sight undarkened, but with mind
Through prejudice and Party bias blind.

AT A MEET.
He. “YES ; HE IS A FINE OLD BEAST ; BUT I THINK I MUST PART WITH HIM."
She. “WHAT! ALL AT ONCE, WHOLESALE ? WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO SELL HIM RETAIL ON LITTLE SKEWERS P.”
A purchasable article, but only at a rate
That makes it unattainable to those of lowly state ?
The Law, as now dispensed, is but a hollow, grim pretence
For trading in injustice and defying common-sense.
Who meddles with it, rich or poor, has ample cause to rue :
'Tis true-tis pity ; pity 'tis, 'tis true !
Whilst humbug and mendacity unchallenged rule the roast,
Oar vaunted “moral progress” is a despicable boast;
Society lies prone beneath the rhetorician's ban,
And glibness 'tis that-even more than money-makes the man.
The age is one of chatter, for the most part insincere ;
Mere phrases from the basis of a prosperous career.
The talker gathers laurels that should be the thinker's due :
'Tis true-'tis pity ; pity 'tis, 'tis true!
A FEW HOME-TRUTHS.
In spite of all the progress now ascribed to modern culture
The habits seem to be unchanged of tiger, serpent, vulture;
The crocodile is what he was ten thousand years ago,
And ever will continue to be thus, for all we know.
The bulk of creatures animate still prey on one another;
The rabbit eats her offspring up-the monkey bites his mother.
Beneath the sun, it would appear, there's really nothing new;
'Tis true-'tis pity ; pity 'tis, 'tis true !
Nor have men's and women's characters or physical condition
Suffered change to any great extent through Latter-Day tuition.
Seeming passes for reality as freely as of yore,
Clever vice looks down on stupid virtue, starving at its door.
When ambition prompts to vileness, conscience shrinks into her shell,
And infamy, allied to wealth, gets on extremely well.
Of course, the many still are badly governed by the few :
'Tis true—tis pity; pity 'tis, 'tis true!
If taken as a specimen-result of “onward movement,"
Our Parliament can scarcely claim to rank as an improvement.
Twain Legislative bodies, bent on mutual frustration,
Both demonstrate how not to do the business of the nation.
And which, of evils two, may be the less is not so clear-
The vulgar stupid demagogue or well-bred silly peer.
We've got them both, however, and they stick to us like glue
'Tis true—'tis pity; pity 'tis, 'tis true!
The "culture,” too, of the æsthetes, with all its flaccid flams,
Its turgid affectations and its silly, sickly shams,
Is but as dross of Brummagem compared with virgin gold
When matched against the vigorous realities of old.
Our matrons and our girls “make up” with powder, bismuth, dye-
Figures as well as frocks, obliging milliners supply
Alas! the fairest cheeks are stained with artificial hue:
'Tis true—'tis pity ; pity 'tis, 'tis true!
Is it well that Justice now should be a word, and nothing more,
With a meaning for the rich, but none whatever for the poor
THE I. H. E. EXAMINATION PAPER.
(To be Answered after a month of calm reflection by those who visited the
late Healtheries.)
1. Did any member of your family survive the Japanese dinner ?
2. Do you consider sitting in the open air, listening to a great-
coated military band in late October, at 9. P.M., conducive to health ?
3. State the claims of Mr. SOMERS VINE to be a sanitary reformer.
4. How many of the Theatrical Managers enrolled their names on
the preliminary List of Guarantors ?
5. Given an Excursion Train, overcrowded with passengers, leay-
ing Bristol at 5 A.M. for London, and returning to its point of
departure at 2 A.M. the following morning, how many invalid travel-
lers in it are likely to be restored to complete health by the journey?
6. Did you consider the Old London Street as a fearful example
to be avoided, or a charming group of houses that might with
advantage be erected at Upham Park Road, Bedford Park ?
7. Do you think it likely that the aristocratic dwellers in the pala-
tial residences surrounding the Horticultural Gardens are incon-
solable at the close of the Exhibition ? 13:
8. What will you do with yourself-especially of an evening-
until the opening of the Musical Inventories ?

THE COMMA BACILLUS.
A Scientific Song.
[Professor RAY LANKESTER writes to point out that Dr. Koch
has not proved that the comma-like Bacillus is the germ of
Cholera.]
PROFESSOR RAY LANKESTER writes and declares
That Koch as a scientist gives himself airs;
In manner Teutonic he laid down the laws,
And vowed he'd discovered the Cholera's cause;
But, whether the Cholera pass by or kill us,
It's nothing to do with the Comma Bacillus.
Though saddened humanity cringes and squirms
Before the pathologist counting his germs;
It's pleasant to know what Koch found in the South
Is seen in each hale individual's mouth;
It's simply a segment, my boys, of spirillus.
There's not the least vice in the Comma Bacillus.
An action for libel would certainly lie
Against Koch, that this ill-used Bacillus might try.
It's hard to be stuck on a microscope slide,
With all your good qualities sternly denied ;
With warm admiration instead you should fill us.
So here's to your health, O my Comma Bacillus !

IT COMPLETELY DEPRIVES SIR Rufus REDMAYNE (THE FAMOUS TRAVELLER) OF ARTICULATE SPEECH WHEN ANYBODY IS PRESENTED

IS RATHER A TRYING ORDEAL TO TIMID PEOPLE LIKE THE Rev. J. PETTIFER FOR INSTANCE.
BOX AND COX.
The end of the farce? Nay, of course it won't do
To apply such a term to a scene on this stage,
Yet la haute politique has its comedy too,
And burlesque high and low is the joy of the age.
On the boards where high tragedy thrills with its shocky,
What if histrions stoop to rehearse Box and Cox ?
Such histrions! Antony's rôle might fit one,
In carriage and chafe as heroic as he.
(No orator ? That was MARK ANTONY's fun.)
The other a CORIOLANUS might be.
The imperious Roman in port and in stride
Carried not a whit more of patrician-born pride.
Oh the buskin for heroes like these, not the sock!
Grand tragedy airs and conclusions of blood !
And yet-well, it comes with a bit of a shock,
But e'en heroes must yield to the popular mood,
At least when they 're histrions also, and so
A complete change of parts may succeed, as things go.
Besides Box was a very Achilles, in pose;
A thrasonical Ajax was Cox, as to mien;
But when it seemed coming to actual blows,
It was time to abate such belligerent spleen.
Though Cox may cry, “Ready!” and Box shout, “Come on!”
Each doesn't like t' other at all, when all's done.
Like the two Kings of Brentford, who, after long strife,
Stand and sniff at one nosegay in token of peace,
The histrions proud give up war to the knife,
Which to all quiet men is a mighty relief.
They were oh! quite prepared for the battle's worst brunt,
But-well, best leave the rest to "our friends in the front.”
THE LATEST MYSTERY OF ISIS.
THOUGH Mr. Ruskin has again been cracking some of his pon-
derous jokes, for the delectation of his select little following at
Oxford, he can scarcely be congratulated on the very newest develop-
ment of his humour. It is of course no less excellent fooling,
à propos of the present condition of the British Navy, to refer to the
scientific Ship-builders of the day as “ironmongers," than it is to
seriously suggest to the Admiralty, without the slightest show of
laughing, that it should return to the obsolete wooden cockle-shell

OVER-PRESSING THE ORACLE.
A SAD case of over-pressure, in connection, not this
time, with a Board-School, but with a Board-one might
almost say the Board itself, is reported in the papers.
That great, calm, solid- not to say stolid-Sphinx-Pro-
vidence of modern Babylon, the Metropolitan Board of
Works, is the victim of this over-pressure; the infliction
is the Metropolitan Public Garden, Boulevard and Play-
ground Association. The M. P. G. B. and P. A. is
always at it. The Board of Works is always being
pestered by what we will call, for shortness' sake, the
Board of Play. The latter has a pestilent theory, which
may perhaps be summarised in the statement, that all
Board of Works, and no Board of Play, makes London a
dull town. So, in fact, it does. But, in the words of the
poet, -
“What's this dull town to Me?"
says the Board of Works. The Board of Works under-
stands Big Drains and Blow-holes and things, but Gar-
dens, Boulevards, Playgrounds ? Bah! And now that
pernicious Board of Play wants to turn the Main Drainage
Embankment into a Boulevard, a Public Promenade, and
Playground, for the benefit of East-end strollers, and
closely-confined children, and such small deer! This is
seething a kid in its mother's milk with a vengeance.
To uglify a city with Drainage Embankments is busi-
ness; but to beautify a Drainage Embankment with
parks and parterres, with lawns and trees is-well, what
is it? The Board of Works oracularly characterises it by
-the tremendous term, “Undesirability.”
That ought to be a settler. But will it? Perhaps
that importunate Board of Play will want to know,
Why? And perhaps JOHN BULL will be interested in
the answer. And perhaps Mr. Punch will press for that
answer, and even insist that it shall be a satisfactory one
before it is accepted as a settlement. On the whole the
establishment of a modern Delphic Oracle in Spring
Gardens seems also an illustration of “undesirability."
Let Lord BRABAZON interrogate the Sphinx again, and
a little more closely. We know from history what
happens to Sphinxes when they are once fairly “collared,"
and subjected to what they themselves would doubtless
characterise as “over-pressure.”

HOUP-LA! Yes, it's all very fine,
But I feel most confoundedly queer ;
And these oddly-matched horses of mine
Are decidedly awkward to steer,

Is a question I cannot decide
In my shaky position up here,
With the brutes I'm instructed to ride.
Look at 'em! Now, does it seem fair

But whether I'm safe for the goal

A WORD AND, A WORRY.
In the language of journals and reviews, Mr. Punch, there are
certain-and uncertain-words and phrases, which, like some dra-
matic productions, get repeated with such frequency that they may
be said to have a "run." In addition to “elastic," "elasticity,"
“tension," "strained relations,” and so forth, an old word has
lately been adopted, seemingly in a new sense, to express a peculiar
shade of meaning—the word “fairly ;” as “ fairly proficient,".
“fairly industrious," "fairly successful.” It appears intended
to signify something more than “moderately” or “ passably,"
and something less than “fully” or “ perfectly," perhaps as
nearly as possible “satisfactory in the circumstances, all things con-
sidered." But now it has come to recur so very often, that its repe-
tition is felt to be considerably tiresome, like the posters on the
railways, at station after station, advertising soap, and cocoa, and
mustard, and corn-flour, which in interminable succession weary
the passenger's mind and eye. “Fairly," indeed, may be a fairly
handy term ; but isn't it rather unfairly hackneyed, and all the
rather that it is so vague as to be scarcely quite intelligible, whilst
it constitutes a tautology which ought to be looked to, inasmuch as
it decidedly amounts to a bit of a bore. In a fairly critical spirit,
trust, of comment on a trivial and slightly tiresome expression,

WITH Mr. Punch's permission, and on the first leisure afternoon,
we will avail ourselves of the opportunity recently afforded us by
the Saturday Review, to re-state a plain matter-of-fact opinion,
expressed by one of us a while ago, and since then much commented
upon, misquoted, and misrepresented, as to the performance of pure
and unadulterated SIAKSPEARE before a theatre-going audience of
our own time; that is, of the last quarter of this Nineteenth Century.
As to other matters treated of in that same article, wherein the
writer got himself a trifle mixed,-and, to quote the Saturday's
favourite RABELAIS, “ by the kibes of our heels, he does not under-
stand the topics”-if Mr. Punch allowed his serenity to be for one
instant disturbed, then :-

its rivals, that the criticisms in the Daily Papers have ceased to be
considered as of any literary value. They are taken and read as
“notices," and the Critic on a Daily Newspaper has become little more
than a Reporter.
As I have said, the Weekly Reviews are without this excuse.
Mr. Punch's Critic may be as deliberate as a Chancery Judge. The
Saturday, and all other Weekly Papers, need be in no hurry. Their
Critics could, if they would, take their own time; and if they choose
to be present at a first performance, more to be seen than to see, they
should, after the first week of its run, take a second and a third
opportunity of seeing the same piece, and by that time they ought to
be duly qualified, supposing them in every other respect competent
for their task, to produce a carefully-considered criticism which should
be worthy of the writer, whose signature ought to be appended to it
(as is the custom in the World, which is W. A.'s or " ARCHER'S
Mount” now, and where “D. C.” was a model to all Critics), useful
to the Actor, and valuable as a well-weighed contribution to the
History of the Drama. The present form of producing criticisms,
or rather “notices,” cannot be satisfactory to the writers, as, being
written in haste, they are frequently repented of at leisure. Scamp-

the Curtain and the hour of the Newspaper's going to press, so that

not be that they are "a lovesick youth and an hysterical schoolgirl.” It is not
thus that I see them when I read the play ; and I have to read it to correct
the impression produced upon me by the acting. Again, what a lugged-in-
by-the-heels inappropriate speech is the lovely one about Queen Mab, as given,
and, as far as I remember, as usually given, on the stage! Yet, how naturally
it comes in when one is quietly reading the play and dwelling on its beauties.
But this I do say, that if a work of surpassing imaginative genius, such as is
Romeo and Juliet, is to be treated in so realistic a manner, that archeologic
correctness is to be the first and chiefest consideration, so that the tailor, and
not the poet, makes the man, then the characters become mere ordinary mortals,
to be judged by ordinary rules, just as they have been measured for their
correct costumes by the ordinary tape. The poetic language they have to utter

is at once out of place, and the sooner the story is reduced to matter-of-fact prose,
with such sensational situations as the action may require, the better for the
audience, the better for SHAKSPEARE, and the worse for the Stage.
For my part, and here I see by your article you will agree with me, I would
that Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, and SHAKSPEARE's poetic dramas, excepting
the Merchant of Venice, resembled the melodrama at Mr. Crummles's theatre,
which “belonged to no particular age, people, or country, and was perhaps the
more delightful on that account, as nobody's previous information could afford
the remotest glimmering"-of the correct scenery, costumes, and properties.

few years, however, there was a notable exception. When Mr. IRVING first
put Hamlet on at the Lyceum, old scenery was used,- and it was among his
biggest monetary successes.
Jerseys.
A Tuber.
There was a notion put about, also, some time ago (which the Saturday
pounced upon with great delight), that I had said that "there was just one
thing SHAKSPEARE could not do,—write a tolerable play for a nineteenth-
century audience.” Now, this is so self-evident as to be of the nature of an
axiom. Did SHAKSPEARE write a play for a nineteenth-century audience? The
answer is, “No, he did not; he wrote for sixteenth- and seventeenth-century and
audiences.” He wrote when, to the majority, plays were instead of books, and his
historical Dramas were chronicles in action. All his plays delight, and never wearyl
his nineteenth-century readers. But for these plays to be tolerable for a nineteenth-
century audience, is quite another matter. Those who took me to task over
the above utterance, were in such a hurry to have a fling at me, that they did not
stop to consider the meaning of the words I used. I never said “readers,”
Pa's-Nips.
Cab-age.
but I did say “ audience ;” and in the latter word lies the whole point.
What is the meaning, in ordinary parlance, of “a tolerable play"? It means
one that an audience will tolerate, but about which it will certainly not be
enthusiastic. In this sense “tolerable” implies “passable.” Again, to speak
by the card, when I said, “ could not do,” it would be absurd to stretch this
expression so as to mean that it was not within SHAKSPEARE's power. Of course,
if SHAKSPEARE were alive now, he could and would write plays which should not
only be tolerable for a nineteenth-century audience, but which would be received
with enthusiasm, would run a thousand nights, and make the fortune of Author,
Actors, and Manager. But you see, my Lord, it only suited the purpose of my hasty
Critics to make me appear to mean just exactly what they wished me to mean.
Your Lordship has had a pretty fair experience of the Stage; tell me is there

placed on the Stage and played just as he wrote it? Was it done in the
eighteenth century? Has it, in fact, ever been done except in SHAKSPEARE'S
own time, when he was Author, Actor, Part-proprietor, and Stage-Manager ?
Has not every reviver of SHAKSPEARE altered, re-arranged, and adapted what-
ever he had decided to produce ? Isn't even Hamlet mutilated for the benefit
of a nineteenth-century audience ? Macbeth has not escaped scot free. The
murder of Lady Macduff and children is so strange to our acting editions, that
some English Critics, remarking on certain liberties in the French version of
Macbeth, recently produced in Paris, severely blamed the poetic adapter for
having invented this scene and interpolated it in his adaptation.
SHAKSPEARE undoubtedly wrote his Dramas, in the first instance, to be acted,
and not to be read; but to be acted in his day, to please his audience. So, when
a Manager produces SHAKSPEARE now, he has to please his audience, and if he

gives them a long-winded play, he knows that his audience will yawn over it,
will leave before it is finished, and that, by the end of a week, no audience at
all will be there to see it. Ask Mr. IRVING ; refer to the revivals by MACREADY,
CHARLES KEAN, PHELPS, FECHTER. Take Romeo and Juliet, and Hamlet, now
being played. Are either of them played as SHAKSPEARE wrote them ? And
if not, why? Because, in the form that delighted sixteenth- and seventeenth-
century audiences, they would be considered intolerable by an audience in the
nineteenth century.
Let a Manager put one of SHAKSPEARE's plays on the Stage without any
tampering with the text, without any re-arrangement of Scenes, but let it be all
just as SHAKSPEARE wrote it for performance before sixteenth- and seventeenth-
century audiences, and let us see how a nineteenth-century audience will take to it.

THE SINGLE SEAT MEMBER.
A Song of Questionings.
What will he be when we really get him,
The Single Seat Member, that Coming Man ?
Will he conduct our affairs (if we let him)
On a pettifogging Parochial plan?
Will he bring in the Vestryman's mind and manners,
His ego exalt, and his h's drop ?
Treat the nation's arms and the people's banners
As yards of bunting, and things of "shop" ?
Will he be a sage, or a small attorney ?
Will he wish to fight in the nation's cause,
With the knightly spirit that ruled the tourney,
Or the yulgar fury of parish “jaws" ?
Will he come with the taint of the till about him,
And duties high with a yard-wand mete?
Will he love the toiler, or gull and flout him,
And Policy hold as the skill to cheat ?
Will he bring us intellect free, unfettered,
Clear brain, escaped from the ban of gold ?
Or as Labour's gang-master, loud, unlettered,
The votes of her wage-bought myriads hold ?
Will he come as the Member for Hóle-cum-Corner,
With never a notion beyond his Ward ?
Will he stand as Socialist scourge and scorner
Of Crown and Constable, Priest and Lord ?
Whatever he'll be, he is coming! Whether
He'll lift us high, or he 'll drag us low,
Or topsy-turvy us altogether,
Is more than his Sponsors appear to know.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A BALLAD OF BILLIARDS.
The billiard season has commenced, and Cook and ROBERTS
and other professionals have made some long scores.]
THE billiard season has begun,
And we shall see full many a run,
That's made by hook or crook ;
The ordinary game is hard,
But when you come to “spot shot barred,”
Then take a leaf from Cook.
Though some folks sneer about the spot,
The amateur will catch it hot,
Who tries the stroke to make;
It's easy when a ROBERTS plays,
But duffers find to their amaze,
They ne'er achieve a “break.”
Don't listen to the books which say
That mathematics make your play,
They only lead to shame;
For since all billiards began,
'Tis practice only makes a man
An expert at the game.
One ROBERTS, in the days of old,
As many sporting prints have told,
Was champion of all;
But now young ROBERTS, PEALL, and COOK
Have brought the veteran to book,
And win with cue and ball.
But leave professionals their play,
We'll show you a more charming way
To circle tables green,
A fair antagonist oppose,
A lady who too surely knows
What “winning hazards" mean.
She 'll “pot” you with supremest grace,
A smile upon her pretty face,
And delicately score ;
And though at billiards you wield
A doughty cue, upon that field,
You 're lost for evermore.

Of high and low and middle-class society,
Of Scotland Yard, of Paris, and la rousse;
Of players, prisons, sentiment, and snobbery,
Finance, flirtation, forgery, and robbery-
Does ARTHUR GRIFFITHS tell in Fast and
Loose.
“ FROM POST TO FINISH.”
A DASHING tale by HAWLEY SMART
The plot we mean not to impart;
But you must heed it!
'Tis full of incident and sport,
Of love and marriage, and in short-
You 're bound to read it!
As we read on, it is confest,
We find the story's interest
Does not diminish:.
The writer ne'er forgets his art,
And all is clever, all is-Smart
From Post to Finish!
THREE CHRISTMAS NUMBERS.
If you live by Thames or Humber,
If you single be or mated,
You must have the Christmas Number,
Of the dear old Illustrated!
If your home's near Kew or Clumber,
If you 're surly or seraphic,
You must take the Christmas Number,
Of the many-pictured Graphic !
If at Stockton or Stogumber,
You feel dismal or ecstatio;
You must get the Christmas Number,
Of the Sporting and Dramatic!

You may sleep like a top, BARBAROSSA, EL CHICO,

Shan't shatter your slumbers and spoil all the fun.
Nor dread premature tintinnabulant tinkle,
Though snoozing like somnolent old Rip Van Winkle.

You have earned your repose, and the world won't complain,
You 'UI doubtless find Morpheus the nicest of gods,
And won't yearn for the charms of Aurora again.

And sing Somnus's praise with mellifluous nose !
You your squabbles have had, but all's well that well ends,
And now, at the term of the day and the pother,
You seem so well matched and such excellent friends
I had best chalk your soles-to know one pair from t'other,
Good night! And I'm sure you 'll not wish night cut shorter,
Or long for the coming of morn-and hot water!
MR. PUNCH bows his acknowledgments to Good Words, which has
had more than one good word for Mr. Punch. Having been born
within the sound of Bow Bells, he cannot help being a son of
Cockaigne, though he is 80 cosmopolitan as to be able to sympathise
with everybody all the world over. Still, from a Cockney point of
view, the only thing that Mr. Punch has to regret about that truly
appreciative, just, and generous article, is that it should bear the
signature of "WALKER.” He would not have your or his
enemies say so, and therefore he says it himself.
Good CHRISTMAS OMEN.-"Yule-tide" has a pleasant sound to a
man in difficulties ; it seems to say, “You 'U tide over 'em.”

A CHANT FOR CHRISTMAS.
At Christmas, in the ancient days,
Right festive was the season,
The Lord of Misrule led the plays,
With Abbots of Unreason.
And grown-up folks, like girls and boys,
Rejoiced in feast and folly, !
With Masks and Mummers made a noise,
Their duty to be jolly.
But now the cynic's voice is heard
To cry down Christmas greetings;
He vows they 're wholly too absurd,
These pleasant Yuletide meetings.
He holds the folk of bygone times
Were only worth our scorning;
And shudders at the cheerful chimes,
That ring in Christmas morning.
We're too wise now, he'd have us know,
To dream of being merry;
He loathes the sight of mistletoe,
And holly branch and berry.
'Twas very well in olden days,
To see the Yule Log splinter,
But cynics sneer at ancient ways,
And hurl contempt at Winter.
They bid us note the empty chair,
And Time's unfeeling paces,
The ghosts of those who once sat there,
With unforgotten faces.
They ever mourn the past, and weep
For days as dark hereafter,
And all the Christmas that they keep,
Has ne'er a sound of laughter.
Away with all this cynic speech,
A churlish heart revealing;
The Christmas bells can truly teach,
In town and country pealing.
They usher in all harmless mirth,
We hear from every steeple
The sacred message, “Peace on Earth-
Goodwill to Christian people ! ”

ITEM FROM "THE SUSSEX DAILY NEWS."
– Vide report of an Agricultural Dinner :-
“Mr. C. ELLIS proposed The Judges.?” And
here follows about fifty lines of Mr. C. ELLIS'S
speech, after which the conscientious reporter
adds, “As all the Judges had left before
this toast was reached, it was not responded
| to, but duly honoured by being drunk." The
toast being “reached," " not responded to,"
“honoured," and "drunk,” is quite inimit-
able. The Judges might just as well have
remained to hear it, as there was not a word
about them in it from beginning to end,
except the formal proposal.
AIRY STATE OF THE LAW.-If the London
Bridge Explosion had taken place on the Sur-
rey side, would it not have been an affair for
the Surrey police ; if on the London side, for
the Metropolitan But if it had taken place
in mid-air, says the Times reporter, "a fur-
ther complication would arise." This points
to a new force of Constabulary, the Balloon
Police, belonging to no particular distriot, and
always "up aloft” keeping watch, like the
"sweet little cherub” in Diddor's ballad.
