"The Ubiquitous is not to be arbitrarily localised, as the Herald-God should know," responded the A -Pervasive-One
sententiously.
"This is a marvellous sight," said Mercury; "one that may well make me and Prometheus rather proud of oiu
mortal proteges."
"It may indeed be called, in a sense somewhat different from the Poet's, to be sure,' the Heaven of Invention,''
responded Mr. Punch.
Mercury pointed with his caduceus to the Great Gun department. "Your youthful Dizzy," said he, "for whom I
admit I have a strong fellow-feeling, wrote Ixion in Heaven. The Thessalian came to grief. How, I wonder, would Gatling
get on there?"
"I perceive your meaning," said the Sage. "There are those, however, who consider that in the propaganda of Peace
projectiles will be found to play the leading part, and that such a Devil Fish as the Torpedo will in the end conduce more
surely to Universal International Harmony than Arion's dolphin."
"Ate and Eighty-Ton Guns seem to be rather more 'in a concatenation accordingly,' at present," remarked Apollo, drily.
"Inventions and Music !" ejaculated the Cyllenian Argiphont. "A charming combination, and one in which PacEBUf
and I feel a natural interest. My Tortoise had to be tortured into tunefulness, and perhaps Humanity may eventually tor-
pedo itself into harmony. Anyhow, these new Shows of yours are not at all a bad notion—for John Bull. Characteristic
jumble of Shop and Song, Business and Bands, Art and Advertisement, Serious Science and Sham Arcadia, Classical Music
and Cheap Dinners I"
"Still the Olympian Smart Young Man, Mercury!" said Mr. Punch, smiling. "What an admirable paragraph
writer you'd make, or what a first-rate Member for Woodstock!"
"Do you think Lord Randolph will turn out as adroit a Bull-driver, in Britain, as I did in Pieria?" queried "the
Saturnian's love-child," archly.
"Can't say," said Mr. Punch. "Though fresh, as you were, from his ' ambrosial (political) swaddling clothes,' the
artful adolescent has shown some nous in getting the British Bulls—some of them—to follow his meandering footsteps.
Whether he'll lead them long, or if so, to a hecatomb, after your memorable example, who can say?"
"Who drives fat oxen should himself be fat," murmured Apollo, musingly.
"A bit of blind Johnsonian dogmatism !" said Mercury. "Look at Vivian Grey! Was he bucolic or adipose? No
brain, not brawn, rules the Boeotians. Apollo, perhaps, was not quite at home amoug the herds of Admetus. Too ideal,
uplifted, Gladstonian! But your mercurial Nimblewit makes the best drover, whether hailing from Cyllene, Bucks or Wood
stock."

"Why, there i» Randolph," said Mb. Pcnch, "chatting with Sir Francis Bolton, seeking inspiration doubtless for the
coming day when he shall' wield the fierce democracy ' as easily as Sir Francis with a touch turns on and off his thousands
of arcs and incandescents."
"When will Strauss strike up?" asked Mercury. "I understand his dance-music makes all the world feel as
feather-heeled as myself."
"It does," responded the Sage. "Strauss would set Olympus tripping it, and get a valse out of Vulcan himself.
He '11 be at it presently. But meanwhile why don't you two musical gods have a turn? I see you have your lyres with you.
Gome on!"
And Mr. Punch waved his baton persuasively.
"Can you conduct?" asked Apollo.
"Don't I conduct my world-renowned Journal? And can't he, who can conduct that, conduct anything, from a concert
to a campaign?" laughed the Sago, confidently.
There was a soft twangling, as of celestial tuning-up, finger and plectrum set to work, and in a twinkling the whole
Inventories was hushed in open-mouthed astonishment at the Olympian strains of a Terpsichorean outburst, sufficiently sweet,
soul-stirring, and toe-quickening, to make even "Leedle Edoabd Strauss" and his merry men " pale their ineffectual fires."
• •••••••
Once more Mr. Punch waved his world-compelling wand, and once more the Mighty Three were alone.
"Wonderful!" cried Apollo and Mercury in a breath. "How do you do it?"
"Would you really like to know?" asked the smiling Musician of Fleet Street.
'• Rather!"
"Well, I haven't time to tell you now," said the Sage. "Oh, don't look so dismally disappointed! I can easily put
you in the way of learning. I am at once the Great Inventor and the Great Harmonist. My Show is biennial and perennial.
Jt does not cover acres, but it pervades the world. Its Inventions are all original, all first-rate, and all—unlike Torpedoes—
for the immediate good of mankind. Its harmonies match the Music of the Spheres, and, like the Angel's voice in Abou
Ben Adhem, are * blent all of sweet accord.' The World's wits dance as gladly to it, as their toes to stringed strains of
Eduard Strauss. Sir Francis Bolton would be the first to acknowledge that, for universal " Instantaneous Illumination,"
Ins knobs and generators, his lamps and dynamos, are, compared with it, as a glow-worm's twinkle to Aurora's full flush.
Mercury, you look amazed. AroLLO, you appear puzzled. No wonder! I '11 relieve your minds. My ' Inventions Exhi-
bition' is portable. You can take it with you, and examine it at your leisure. Lolling comfortably on a convenient cloud,
or handy bed of amaranth, you, God of Music, and you, Arch-Inventor, can look over it together, and learn a few wrinkles,
each in your own line. That's how it 'a done 1 Take it, and make Olympus as happy as Earth!"

GISSING THE ROD.
We have but now laid our hand upon a few days' old number
of the Pail-Mall Gazette, which oontaineth a piece of wisdom so
entirely monumental, that it well deserves to be cere verenniue "—
which we would render, for the moment, into "longer-lived than its
own brass." It has nothing to do with the conduct of that bright
and many-sided journal, be it Baid, but merely with a Correspondent
who has at least the courage of his opinions in signing his name.
The correspondence appears to have begun in one of the endless
foolishnesses about contemporary novel-writing which appear to
beguile the leisure Tof so many 'of our modern Cacoethios. And
"Sylvanus " and " Geoege Gissing " are severe upon a Mr. Moore,
who seems to have complained that, in these days of Mudie-oum-
Smith tyranny, books are sometimes capriciously withdrawn from
all the bookstalls of the Autocrats, and the Author left without a
remedy. As a matter of fact, that is quite true ; and the personalities
of " Sylvanus," who Bays he is a woman, neither young nor old, and
so adopts that eminently female signature (Girtonism is good—but
imperfect Girtonism is dangerous), do not affect the position of Mr.
Moore.
But "Sylvanus" is eclipsed indeed by the Correspondent who
follows him or her—the great Mr. George Gissing. Humbly we own
that we never heard his name before, though it seems suggestive of a
kind of guttural German embrace performed by the Rationaliser of
the Land. But Gissing should be known. This is what Gis.si.no
writes:—
"One of the most painful confessions in literature is that contained in the
preface to 'Pendennis,' where Thackeray admits that 'since the author of
Tom Jones was buried no writer of fiction among us has been permitted to
depict to his utmost power a man,'—on penalty, be it understood" (by
Gissino) "of a temporary diminution of receipts. If this be not a trades-
man's attitude, what is? Let novelist* be true to their artistic conscience,
and the public taste will come round. In that day there will be no complaint
of the circulating libraries. It is a hard thing to say. but Thackeray, when
he knowingly wrote below the demands of his art to conciliate Mrs. Grundy,
betrayed his trust; and the same thing is being done by our living novelists
every day."
O ye demigods and little Gisstngs, did anybody ever hear the
like of this? Not all the waters of Gissingen can do much for any-
body who openly prays that the publio taste may "come round"
again to the open coarseness of Tom Jones; the vice of an age as
much as our age has its own, which Thackeray, one of the cleanest-
minded writers who ever lived, points out in that same preface to be
happily out of date. All the world knows what that preface meant,
save and except Gissing, who thinks that Thackeray's artistic
conscience suggested Dirt, and his art demanded it, but that he was
afraid of losing money by it I! Had he but been true to his con-
science and his tastes, his receipts would have gone up in time, for
Gissing would have bought his books. But Thackeray betrayed
his trust (ye gods! Thackeray !) by being sweet and pure, though
vol. Lxxxvm.
it is a "hard thing]to say." i If should have been not only hard but
impossible, Gissing. As for our.living novelists, they are disgusting
GiesiNG by " doing the same every day." Well, they are, Gissing;
and speaking with some knowledge of them, we do not altogether
regret it. We regret that Gissing cannot get the reading he likes,
except by going back to more conscientious days; and we do not
wholly love Mrs. Grundy. Bnt we like her taste in books better
than Gissing's. We will do all we oan to help you to your desired
celebrity, Gissing. though we care not to be gissing who can have
brought you up. Praised be the gods for thy foulness, Gissing! but
also that, as we fondly hope, there are not very many like thee.
HOW TO COIN MONEY.
(According to Precedent.)
As easy as possible. All you want is some paste, a pair of scissors,
a number of old Periodicals, and a moderate credit at a Printer's and
a Paper-maker's. With these requisites you can commence publish-
ing a new Weekly Paper, which you can oall boldly,
SWEET STUFF.
You will have made it up of cuttings from the Periodicals already
referred to. But you want a little original matter, and will adver-
tise in your own Paper that you will give a
£10 Prize for the Best Romantic Story,
reserving to yourself, of course, the right of publishing every Tale
you receive. Thus, for a moderate sum, you will obtain any amount
of Original Fiotion, of more or (generally) less merit. But now you
want to advertise the Paper a little, bo again offer Prizes, say,
Special Prize—a Christening Silver Goblet,
to be given on the condition that the Baby to be named is given the
sole title of " Sweet Stuff." Then, to please other tastes, announce
Unique Prize—First Class Funeral.
The lucky recipient to guarantee, however, that when he is buried
his exeoutors shall be directed to inscribe merely " Sweet Stuff" on
his tombstone.
Other prizes and rewards of a similar character might be awarded.
For the rest stick to scissors and paste.
Sweet Stuff you will find soon paying its way. Its circulation will
increase by leaps and bounds. Before you know where you are,
without the assistance of a staff, without the aid of anyone, you will
find you have amassed what, of course, you will advertise everywhere,
"A COLOSSAL FORTUNE."

"A NEW LEAF" IN LAW COURTS.
(A Charge by Mr. Justice Lacon.)
Gentlemen op the Joky,—Yon have been engaged a whole fortnight in
trying; a case which, when I was a boy, would have been decided at one sitting
in a single day. During your detention in this Court, obliged to neglect your
own affairs, they have probably, for some, if Dot all of you, gone to ruin. 1
would certainly have cut proceedings short had I not known that the consequence
of that step would be a new trial, and after that an appeal with all the waste
of words you have had to endure reproduced over and over again. I am going to
add to that endurance as little as I can. The Counsel for both Plaintiff and
Defendant have made speeches full ten times as long as they had any occasion
to, and examined and cross-examined an excessive number of Witnesses at a
most unnecessary length. It may be expected that in pursuance of the practice
which hat become prevalent, I should follow suit, and deliver a summing-up
of proportionate prolixity. I shall subject you to no suoh infliction.
The matter in question for your decision is one that lies iu a nutshell. It is
simply as follows. {Here the learned Judge, in a feu> words, stated the case.)
All of the evidence that has any bearing whatever on the case is that of six
Witnesses on either ride out of sixty. I shall read you only that of the six
(which his Lordship briefly did). Now you know all that you have any need to,
for agreement in your verdict, which you can retire to consider, if not
prepared to return it without leaving the box. As this is the beginning of the
year, when there is annually talk of " turning over a new leaf," I have determined
to do so myself in my judicial capacity, by way of example; and I hope none
of you will ever again be detained for half a lunar month by proceedings so
preposterously protracted as to suggest the influence of lunacy.
Why Not P—East London is at present in desperate need of work. East
London is always in much need of play. The converting of the Main Drainage
Embankment into a place of public recreation would give East London work
now and play hereafter. This seems a consummation devoutly to be wished.
Why not bring it about? The ouly reason seems to be that the Metropolitan
Board of Works consider it " undesirable." Is that "final, conclusive and
binding" as the parchment-spoilers say P Mr. Punch thinks not. What does
the Public think?

'ARRY ON 'APPINESS.
Dear Charlie,
A 'Appy New Year to yer I That's the straight tip for to-day,
So I'm bound to be in it, old chip, though things don't look remarkable gay.
1 inclose you a Card—a correot one, I 'ope, though it strikes one as queer
That such picters is thought apprypo this particular time of the year.
You '11 observe there's a hangel in muslin a twisting 'erself all awry,'
With some plums, happle-blossoms, and marigolds, backed by a dab 'ojblue sky.
Dekkyrativo it's called, so the miyyy informed me who nobbled my tanner;
I call it a little bit mixed, like the art on a Odd-Fellow's banner.
But, bless you, it's all of a piece, Charlie—Life is so muddled with rot
That it takes rayther more than a Judge or a Jury to tell yer wot's wot.
Whether knifing a boy 'oos one's peckish means murder, if lyings are libels.
Seem questions as bothers the Big Wigs, in spite of their Blue Books and Bibles.
Where are we, old pal? that's the question. Perhaps it would add to one's ease
If life wos declared a " Mixed Wobble," its motter a " Go as you please."
But 'tisn't all Cinder-path, Charlie, wus luck! if it was, with " all in,"
You wouldn't go fur wrong, I fanoy, in backing " yours truly" to win.
"A 'Appy New Year!" That's the cackle all over the shop like to-day.
Wot's 'Appiness? Praps Mister Buskin and little Lord Garmoyle will say.
You an me's got our notions of yum-yum, as isn't fur wide o' the mark,
Bat who '11 give us change for 'em, Charlie P Ah! that's where we 're left in
the dark.
The Reform Bill won't do it, my Pippin, no that you may lay your last dollar.
The fact is this 'Appy New Year fake is 'oiler, mate, hutterly 'oiler.
'Twon't ily—like the Christmas Card hangels, it doesn't tit into the facks;
All it does is to spread tommy-rot, and to break all the Postmen's poor backs.
You'll be thinking I've got the blue-mouldies, old man, and you won't be fur
hout.
Funds low with yours truly, my bloater, no chances of getting about.
Larks, any amount of 'em, going, advertisements gassing like fun,
But 'Arrt, for once in the way, 's a btone-broker and not in the run.
It's cutting, that's wot it is, cutting. I'm so used to leading the field,
That place as fust-iiy at life's fences is one as I don t like to yield,
Espesnly to one like Bill Blossit,—no style, not a bit about Bill 1
And they talk of a 'Appy New Year, mate, and cackle o' Peace and.Goodwill!
Oh yus, I'd goodwill 'em, Bill Blossit and false Fanny Friswell, a lot 1
They are olf to the World's Fair to-night, Sir, and that 'i wy I say it's suoh rot.
If form such as mine's to go 'obbling whilst Mugginses win, out 'o sight,
I say the World's Handicap's wrong, mate, and Christmas Cards won't set it
right.
Lor bless yer, he ain't got no patter, not more than a nutmeg, Bell ain't;
But the railway has taken his shop, and he's oome out as fresh as new paint.
And so because I 'm out of luck, and that duller has landed the chink,
She 'ooks onto him like a bat to a belfry, Sir 1 What do you think P
A 'Appy New Year? Yus, it looks like it! Charlie, old ohap, I've heard tell
Of parties called Pessymists, writers as swear the whole world's a Big Sell;
No doubt they've bin jilted, or jockeyed by some such a Juggins as Bill;
And without Real Jam - cash and kisses—this world is a bitterish pill.
Still I wish you a 'Appy New Year, if you care for the kibosh, old Chappie,
Though 'taint 'Igh Art Cards full o' gush and green paint '11 make you and me
'appy-
Wot we want is lucre and larks, love and lotion as much as you '11 carry!
Give me them, and one slap at that Bill,—they 're the right New Year Gifts to
suit 'Arrt,

NOTHING LIKE NUMBERS.
The .Triangle/, EuclideviUe.
Mr Dear Mr. Punch,
Before Mr. Courtney's excellent plan for secur-
ing proportional representation is forgotten, if not
forgiven, will you kindly allow me to recapitulate what
I understand to be its provisions?
If am not mistaken, the ex-Minister wishes to give
everybody one vote more than the number of Candi-
dates. Thus, if there are five Candidates, every one is
to have six votes. This is as simple as possible—say
that there are 12,000 votes, then this number must be
divided by six, which will give 2,000. It stands to
reason, then, that any one having more than 2,000, must
have been elected, beoause 2,000 represents a sixth, and
only a fifth is required, as there are only five Candi-
dates.
This is perfectly simple, and comprehensible. Thus,
we will imagine a list of Candidates:—
1. Mr. Gladstone.
2. Mr. Bradlauoh.
3. Mr. William Holland.
4. Mr. Tracy Turnerklli.
5. Mr. Hugh Conway.
We will imagine the votes are given, and at the first
scrutiny Messrs. Gladstone and Bradlaugh are elected,
both having more than 2000 respectively—the first
having 8000, the second, 3000. We now take the votes
not required by the two duly elected Members and add
them to the other Candidates requiring votes. Mr.
Hugh Conway has 500, and Mr. Tracy Turnkrelli, 500.
Each of these require 1500 votes a pieoe to obtain the
required number, so we knock off 6,000 of Mr. Glad-
stone's votes and 1000 of Mr. Bradlaugh's and begin
counting again. We have a second scrutiny with the
following result:—
Hugh Conway . . 684
Tracy Turnerelli . 1007
William Holland . 5000
Now Mr. William Holland is triumphantly re-
turned by an enormous majority to every one's surprise,
as in the last scrutiny it will be remembered he had no
record. And now it is discovered, by turning the votes
round and beginning to count at the other end, that quite
a different result would be achieved, that the figures
would come out thus:—
Hugh Conway . . 5991
Tracy Turnerelli . 503
William Holland . 7
This of course differs vastly from the second sorutiny,
and is a little embarrassing. But say a third is tried,
beginning the counting in the middle, and then we get
the following;—
Tracy Turnerelli . 5991
Hugh Conway . , 503
William Holland . 7
This again is rather disappointing, as it shows that
the same number of votes may be productive of vastly
different results. But perhaps the simplest way to meet
the admitted difficulty is to multiply the favourite by
six, adding ten to each of the others, and a moiety of the
whole number. This will give us (I have not worked it
out on paper but it can easily be verified):—
Tracy Turnerelli . 24000
Hugh Conway . • 7
William Holland . 1143
This somehow does not look right, because by our first
rule Mr. Tracy Turnerelli has many thousands, more
than he requires, and the others considerably less. So,
again, we add sixteen, divide by five, multiplying by
the result thus obtained and leaving out tractions—
but here, as 1 am rather at fault, I call upon Mr. Court-
ney to take the matter out of my hands, and himself
explain his admirable system. With deep respect,
Yours, like Plum Pudding and Mince Pies at this

NO JOKE.
A few days since a man,
charged with begging, and who
said he had walked eight hundred
miles in search of work, was
brought before Mr. Balguy, the
excellent Magistrate of Woolwich
Police Court, when the following
dialogue (suggesting that perhaps,
after all, employment just now
may be scarce) took place:—
"Mr. Balouy: And so you may
go on for a thousand miles longer. A
man who is thrown out of work just
now has very little hope. Why don't
you go to the workhouse? Defen-
dant: The workhouse is not for
an able-bodied man like me, able
and willing to work. Besides, I am
only one out of thousands of men
out of work all over the country. I
saw hundreds and hundreds at the
docks this morning fighting for the
chance of an hour's work. Mr.
Balouy: Have you tried the new
docks at Tilbury? Defendant : Tee,
Sir; but there were a hundred men
waiting for every one wanted. Mr.
Balgvy: Tou are a Scotchman, are
you not? If a Scotchman cannot get
work nobody can. (. / laugh in court.)
Don't laugh. It is not a joke, but a
fact; for Scotchmen, as a rule, are in-
dustrious and persevering. Depen-
dant: I really don't know where to
turn next."
As he had said, the workhouse
was not the place for able-bodied
men such as he; and as for the
only other refuge, there still
exists amongst the class to which
he belongs an objection to the
prison. So the only answer to the
kindly-intent ioned request to
"move on'' was " whither!"

EDUCATIONAL ESTIMATES.
(By a Parochial Philistine.)
We've reason to congratulate
Ourselves, you think, Mundella,
So mightily that our school-rate
Ameliorates our " fellah."
Butwheninstruction shall have all
The People elevated,
Oh, then what will therefrom befall
The Higher Classes rated!
What will they do for servant-
maids.
Cooks, footmen, grooms, and
pages,
Who 'II claim, upraised in mental
grades,
As nigh a rise in wages;
The price of Education's fruits,
For hands to wait at table.
Clean knives and forks, and shoes
and boots,
And tend the steed and stable?
Eftsoons will menials, maids, and
knaves,
Both, come too dear to cost us.
The system of a race of slaves
Is now for ever lost us.
It was, in sooth, a Pagan plan,
Because, though queer men, truly,
A Nigger is a kind of man,
So, likewise, is a Coolie.
Well stored with Lower Orders'
heads,
We ne'er shall get those others
To scrub our floors, and make our
beds,
Fair sisters, gentle brothers,
Except on .terms which would
almost
Amount to ruination;
Then wait we on ourselves, and
boast
Of popular elevation.
IN A CHEISTMAS NUTSHELL.

Count Munsteb presents his compliments to Earl Granvii.le, and
will be extremely obliged if he can inform him whether he or any
member of his Government has ever heard of a tract of land lying
beyond the region of the Orange River; and if so, what they think
of it. n>
Earl Granville presents his best compliments to Count Munster,
and begs, in reply to his kind inquiries, to inform him that as it is
an invariable custom for himself and his colleagues never to have
I any cognisance of any land whatever, either beyond the Orange
I River or elsewhere, until the knowledge they have acquired on the
subject is either useless, or humiliating, or both, he has not yet
received any information about the tract in question, but hopes that
his Excellency is quite well, and enjoying the pleasant spring
weather.
P.S.—Earl Granville takes this opportunity of adding, in a purely
sportive vein, that though he and his colleagues never heard of the
place, they should consider further inquiries on the matter a distinct
| violation of the integrity of the British Empire.
m.
Count Munsteb's kind compliments to Earl Granville and the
Earl of Derby, and would be glad to know whether at this present
moment, an English Travelling Circus is in need of British protection
beyond the Orange River; and if so, where?
My Lords it.
I am astonished, surprised, and hurt at having been kept
waiting six months without any reply to my simple and ingenuous
inquiry made in all good faith in November last. The boy waits for
an answer to this. I have the honour to be, my Lords,
Your Lordships' faithful servant,
Munsteb.
Dearest Count Munsteb, Vl
We were out of ink, 'pon my word we were. But you know
the little ins and outs in these matters, and will take our petit faux
pas diplomatique in a pleasant and oon genial spirit. But
we '11 see about it. All in good time. Yours cordially.
{Signed) Granville.—Derby.
vi.
Count Munsteb begs to inform Earl Granville that he has
received instructions from his Government to announce the annexa-
tion to the German Empire of the entire tract of land beyond the
Orange River, extending five thousand miles West by East to longi-
tude 42° 37" inolusive.
VII.
Lord Granville and Lord Derby by telegram to Count Munsteb.
Bless us! you don't say so!
WAITING FOR THE WAGGON.
As we have already waited three-quarters of an hour in the centre
of a dark and stuffy tunnel, and I am due in the City half-an-hour
ago, perhaps it would be as well to inquire if there is a stoppage on
the line.
Guard, have you any reason to suppose that the train has been
stopped in order to allow the engine-driver and stoker to have a quiet
game of cribbage behind the coals in the tender?
As I have been particularly recommended by my Dootor to " select
a bracing air," and as I suffer from asthma and chronic bronohitis,
I really don't think that this detention in a sulphurous sewer near
Baker Street for a whole hour is likely to improve my general health.
Porter, is my bed made up in the wagon-lit which now runs be-
tween Earl's Court and the Mansion House?
Quite considerate of the Company to keep one's train waiting at
South Kensington. Can visit Museum.
In spite of the " immense benefits" which the newspapers say will
accrue to the Public from the line between Aldgate and the Mansion
House, the working arrangements of the " Inner Circle " can hardly
as yet be said to be " all square."

THE END OF AN AOT.
A few days ago a prisoner who had confessed that he had
frequented a public place with the intention of committing a theft,
was liberated by Mr. D'Eyncouet on the score that two Judges had
decided that a place could not be said to be "frequented" by a
person if the alleged frequenter only paid it a single visit. The
prisoner was so overjoyed at this that he fainted away on
the spot I When he recovered, the Magistrate informed * him
that, though he (the prisoner) had been under the impression
that he was picking pockets, yet, in the eye of the Law, which
must be very short-sighted, he was not guilty of anything of
the sort, as the pockets in question being empty, are, it appears,
anybody's property and open to all the world. The new legal arau-
mentum ad pocketum—so to speak—is doubtless cheering to digital
experimentalists, but somewhat discomforting to the publio at large.
A little more of this delightfully subtle casuistry applied to the
Criminal Code and the Ten Commandments will, we should think,
ensure the advent of that Universal Freedom for which philosophers
—and pickpockets—have so long been yearning.

PANTOMIME PROBABILITIES.
These is only one "West End Pantomime, for a Pantomime in a Circus
is not a Pantomime within the meaning of the Act, and so we may
consider the veteran
E. L. Blanchabd's
Whittington, pro-
duced by Augustus
Dbubiolanus (who
does the Crystal
Palace Panto as well,
equally as well, we
hear), to be the only
genuine Pantomime.
Sanger's is not a
West-Ender, being
indeed the Surrey
side; so, unless
there's one at
St. George's Hall,
Langham Plaoe,
with Cornet Grain
for Harlequin, and
Alfred Pees for
Clown, we know of
no rival to Whitting-
ton. But, as Mr.
Punch's young men
insist on taking it
easy this week, and
are all out Christ-
masing, not one of
them can be found
to write an account
of any Pantomime
whatever, or to draw
a pioture, or to en-
grave it, or out it,—
on second thought
they all agree to "cut it,—why so do We—the Editorial We—till
next week, when we promise a full, true, and particular account of
the Success—we can record a gorgeous success—at Drury Lane.
At the Covent Garden "Cirqueries," William the Silent points
to the newspapers with pride, and like Prince Paul sings—
Voila ce que l'on dit de moi,
Dans la gazette d'HoLLANDE.
At the Court Theatre—which is a South-western theatre—is Boxan-
cox, or Harlequin Major-General Bouncer the Magic Match Box and
the Little Back Second Floor Room. There are no Parisian Panto-
mimes, but M. Sabdou has recently produced a play which Mr.
James Mollot—Vagabond Jimmi—assures us is on an Irish
historical subject, as of course anyone might tell by the title, The
O' Dora. Sir,,,Wilfrid says it is a temperance play, and its right
name is The" O Dora. We must go and see it for ourselves.
Harlequin Ironmonger is still running at the St. James's.

Augustus Druriolanus, the Kbnownbd
Warrior.
"I'm monarch of all I survey,—
My right there 'b not one to dispute."
PRINCIPAL EVENTS OF 1885.
(Compiled by our Cynical Prophet.)
January.—Ioe, snow and sultry summer weather.
February.— Opening of the House of Commons. Talk.
March.—The House of Commons in session. More talk.
April.—The Parliament still sitting. Most talk.
May.—The Royal Academy Dinner. Sweet-stuff speeches by the
President.

Frantic Excitement.
July.—Various proposals anent the Militia. Most practical of
them—Keep it permanently embodied, and offioer it entirely with
Pield Marshals.
August.—Militia entirely forgotten, and frantic excitement about
else.
,—The House of Commons, after getting through six
of hard talk, adjourned to look after the Grouse and Part-
ridges.
October.—Publication of 247 Christmas Annuals.
November. — Closing of the Inventories, and opening of the
Theatres.
December.—The Compliments of the Season—Bills, Indigestion.
Waits, Insomnia, and the usual gush about a Merry Christmas, and
a Happy New Year.

WRONG SIDE AND RIGHT.
One year more is one too many
But for few, indeed, if any,
Old however they may grow,
Save the very poor and needy,
Or extremely sick and seedy,
Some, that may be fain to go.
At what decade does one find him
With his best of life behind him,
And declining days before f
Which New Year, as first of lesser
Vigour than its predecessor,
On the wrong side must he soore f
Past twice ten, to girls in plenty,
On the wrong side seems of twenty,
If they say not so for fun.
Is nineteen upon the right side?
And, regarded on the bright side,
Which is the wrong side of One P
Right or wrong which side of Eighty?
Though the load of years be weighty,
Eighty-one's the right—no bounds
To the hope that you are going,
Nearer, on as time is tlowing,
To the Happy Hunting Grounds.
SOME ELECTION ADDRESSES.
To the Electors of the Ward Borough of Drury Lane.
Gentlemen,
In soliciting your suffrage, I really don't think that I need
introduce myself. You know me already—or, if you don't, I can
conscientiously assert that it is not my fault. My claims to your
votes are simply irresistible. My Pluck is not unrecognised by the
World, and I have almost discovered the secret of perpetual Youth.
If I am elected, here's a Transformation Scene for you all! Every
man, woman, and child in your Ward shall be placed on the Free
List for the Drury Lane Pantomime of 1886, which, I need hardly
remark, will be the most colossal, most stupendous, funniest, merriest
and very best thing ever put on any stage! Aug-st-s H-bb-s.
To the Electors of the Strand.
Gentlemen,
I have no politics—none whatever. Excuse my glove.
You will, however, agree with me—I know you will—that the fellows
who are always taking up our noble thoroughfare want taking down.
Then that block of 'buses at the corner of Wellington Street is most
un-bussy-ness-like. Return me, and I '11 abolish it! Keep your
eye on your father, and your father will pull you through, and if I
don't catch the Speakers eye, my name isn't J. L. T-le.
To the Magna-Chartists of Wapping Borough.
Gentlemen,
I come before you as an ill-treated Nobleman. It is true I
no longer languish in Dartmoor, whither I was sent by the machina-
tions of an unprincipled Government. Perhaps Dartmoor's a plaoe I
Or ton't to mention, so I will merely observe that I come before you on a
broad personal basis. I would support any party that would under-
take to bring the only genuine Castro over from Paramatta, and
meanwhile my motto is that some Electors has money and no brains,
and some Candidates has brains and no money, and that the former
are evidently intended for the use of the latter.
Sir R-g-b T-ch-b-bne, Bart.
To the Electors of any Metropolitan Borough that is idiotic
accept me as its Candidate.
Gentlemen,
Although I have no reason to suppose that one among you
is so much as acquainted with my name, still less with any claims of
mine to represent you all in Parliament, I think it as well to let you
know at once that it is my intention to solicit your suffrages on the
simple ground of my possession of a really surprising amount of
native impudence, and a total want of all political knowledge or
experience.
I am a true Liberal, and although I am unhappily prevented by
the operation of the Corrupt Practices Act (the only regrettable
measure passed by the present Government) from displaying my
Liberality as I should desire, I yet beg to assure you that I nave
managed, by dint of screwing my workmen and swindling my cus-
tomers, to amass a "modest competence," and that I am ready—
indirectly, of course—to spend as much of it among you as it would
be safe for me to do, considering the stringent provisions of the Aot
to which I have referred. Need I say more?
I remain, your devoted Servant, M. Oneybags.

I don't know none on 'em as begins so, so I epose its wot we Orthers

of them scrumpshus entertainmeants. But he shouldn't condersend
to stoop from his lofty spear, and tork, or rayther rite, wot I'm
oompeld to call gammon. He says as it isn't as he cares pussonally
for wot he, sumwot corsely, calls "the Flesh Pots of Egyp"—tho'
witoh of the many ontrays he means by that indesent illusion I 'm
sure I don't no, not with even all my egsperience—but he feels most
keanly the exclusion from them Marble Alls in witch sum yung lady
used to dream as she dwelt. But then, strange to Bay, he goes on to
tell us as how he has bin to everry one on 'em wunoe, as a frend of

speshal seat, and a speshal speech.
Well, I natrally trembels as I asks the question, but I wunders
how many people who has ewer bin to these abodes of bliss, bleeves
this prowd but hungry City Hoffioer. It's all werry well to speak
oontempshously of his being "flooded" with dinner inwitashuns.
Good grayshus I wot a idear I flooded with 'em! but, as no one nose
better than me does, there's dinners and dinners, the same as there's
turtel soup, and there's cold shoulder, and my egsperienced eye
reads atween the lines of his werry undignyfied letter, a hungering
arter the loftyest forms of queeseenery, and the oldist forms of grand
wines, with a hunger as wood do honner to a past Lord Mare who
was blest with a Oliver's twist.
He pints out, however, one exseption to the crewel rule. The
onest Fishmongers, as Amlet oalls 'em,—so praps he knowd more on

out this hungry oflshal at their numerus Bankwets—and they are

A NEW GUINEA'S WORTH!
We have not been requested to publish the following corre-
The Imperial and Colonial Convention
My Lord Society, Niio Ouinea.
lir reply to your Lordship's communication of the 15th ult.,
expressing, on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, a lively convic-
tion that the "best interests of all parties would be most efficiently
served by the entire absence of definite aim in negotiation, coupled
with a resolute avoidance of clearness and perspicuity, in the ianguage
official or otherwise, in which the details of the question at issue
might happen to be discussed," 1 have now the honour to inform you
that it has come to the knowledge of this Society that a gunboat, Hy-
ing the colours of the Imperial German Navy, has been for some
time busily engaged along the whole of the ooast of this extensive
and valuable Continent, as well as among the numerous rich and
productive neighbouring islands, and that there is every reason to
apprehend that unless some vigorous action is speedily taken, the
whole Archipelago, including New Scotland. Young Brompton, Old
Britain, West Putney, East Ireland, North Wales, Greater Brixton,
and some twenty-five other obviously natural British dependencies,
comprising together an area equal in extent to that of the united
Continents of Asia and South America, will pass suddenly into the
hands of some one of the more aggressive and ambitious European
Pouters. Hoping to hear promptly from your Lordship on the matter,
as the situation, involving as it does the future of the whole Anglo-
Saxon race in this hemisphere, may be regarded as momentous and

Dear Sib, The Colonial Office.
Youb letter has been received by me, and, I feel I need hardly
assure you, has amused and interested me immensely. We are all
asking ourselves in this Department " what oan that German oruiser
be up to?" Pray, therefore, make no sign; were you to do so you
might necessitate the use of plain-speaking on the part of somebody
(a thing highly to be deprecated in delicate situations), and spoil all
the fun! Begging you to be carefully on your guard to do nothing,
and to feel assured that whatever happens, Her Majesty's Govern-
ment are fully prepared to give the matter their utmost oonsidt ration.

It is with profound regret, not unmingled with annoyance,
that I have to announce to you that yesterday evening the Captain
of the German cruiser suddenly producing from the hold of his
vessel a parcel containing a dozen of the national Hag of his country,
proceeded to hoist one at this place, and at the same time announced
his intention of continuing the prooess at intervals in every direotion
until he had exhausted his stock, and annexed the entire Continent.
This spot has already been re-named Orosser Brixtonburg, and I am
inditing this letter under difficulties from the top of a bathing
maohine, to which these offices, under a peremptory notice of eviction,
have been hurriedly transferred. Respectfully directing your Lord-

in this portion of the globe is now hopelessly compromised,

Deab 8ib, The Colonial Office.
I have the honour to acknowledge your communication of
the 17th intt., which it affords me much satisfaction to say not only
pleased, but surprised me. The tact and discretion shown by the
German Commander iu avoiding, while carrying out a delicate
manoeuvre, anything like a rupture of those friendly relations that it
has always been the aim and hope of Her Majesty s Government to
cultivate and maintain with everybody and anybody, cannot be too
cordially acknowledged. With regard, to "the future of the Anglo-
Saxon raoe," to whioh you so creditably refer, I have to direct your
attention to the faot that a mere question of detail such as this lies
distinctly outside the traditions of this Department. Requesting
you, therefore, to oonvey to the Society you represent the entire
satisfaction of Her Majesty's Government with what they can only
regard as a very honourable, desirable, and timely solution of an
interesting question; and wishing you and all vour brother Colo-
nists, under all the circumstances, a very Happy New Year,
I have the honour to be, &c,
SEVENTY-FIVE!
[On Monday, the 29th of December, 1884, Mr. Gladstone completed his
seventy-fifth year.]

To far Midlothian's heart, yet valid still
With brow defiant of Time's ruthless furrow,

Loved, hated, now, but apprehended dimly
By loud denouncers as by henchman leal.
Through fifty years of strenuous toil elastio
Responsive to each shaping touoh of Time;
Proteus, but to high influences plastic,
Of oeaseless growth and long-enduring prime.
Gladstone! A name to conjure with, that lingers
With a half love on hatred s very lips!
Look-thinned, face-worn bv Age's iron fingers,
But suffering yet no shadow of eclipse.
Ad multus annus! Gladdened by the crowning
Of a long-cherished hope with sure success,
Plucked from the waves of strife like honour drowning,
Take birth-day ease far from St. Stephen's press.
No long repose awaits our Palinurus,
May Heaven strengthen his tenacious hand
From the deep's many dangers to secure us,
For troubles throng the Bea and haunt the land.
No coasting caution, Steersman, will avail us.
You must, with iron grip and heart uncraven,
Straight o'er the seething billows point and sail us
Toward a safe and honourable haven.
And so Punch wishes you all pluck and power
In this imperial enterprise to thrive.
Be youthful resolution your joint dower
With wisdom calm that comes with Seventy-five!

I no sometimes read dreadful storys of starwashun, and they

pint, as I red the other day in my favrite noosepaper, the City Press.
An igh hoffioer of the Copperashun, who signs his name with a Cue—
I don't know none on 'em as begins so, so I spose its wot we Orthers
calls a nom der pluom, rites to complane as how as the great City
Oilds never asks him and his numrous brotheren to dinner.
Pore fellah! I'm sure as I pitys him artily, knowing wot I nose
of them scrurnpshm entertainmeants. But he shouldn't oondersend
to stoop from his lofty spear, and tOTk, or rayther rite, wot I'm
oompeld to call gammon. He says as it isn't as he cares pussonally
for wot he, sum wot corsely, calls "the Flesh Pots of Egyp"—tho'
witch of the many ontrays he means by that indesent illusion I'm
sure I don't no, not with even all my experience—but he feels most
keanly the exclusion from them Marble Alls in witch sum yung lady
used to dream as she dwelt. But then, strange to say, he goes on to
tell us as how he has bin to everry one on 'em wunce, as a frend of
one of the Court, but, as he loftylv hobserves, so ooud any meer
Mr. _ Smith, or even a Mr. Jones—now complementary to the City
Arkiteo!—if, as how he had bin arsked, but he natrally. as a lofty
City swell, pines for the distingwist honner of a speshal inwite, a
speshal seat, and a speshal speech.
Well, I natrally trembels as I asks the question, but I wunders
how many people who has ewer bin to these abodes of bliss, bleeves
this prowd but hungry City Hoffioer. It's all werry well to speak
contempshously of his being "flooded" with dinner inwitashuns.
Good grayshus! wot a idearl flooded with 'em! bat, as no one nose
better than me does, there's dinners and dinners, the same as there's
turtel soup, and there's cold shoulder, and my egsperienoed eye
reads atween the lines of his werry undignyfied letter, a hungering
arter the loftyest forms of queeseenery, and the oldist forms of grand
wines, with a hunger as wood do honner to a past Lord Mare who
was blest with a Oliver's twist.
He pints out, however, one exseption to the crewel rule. The
onest Fishmongers, as Amlet calls 'em,—so praps he knowd more on
'em at Fishmongers' All than at blooming Billingsgate—never leaves
out this hungry ofishal at their numerus Bankwets—and they are
werry near being fust class, speshal]y their '20 sherry to witch I'm
particular partial—not ony so, but, as he says, they are so werry
fond of him and his brotheren, that no less than eighteen on 'em het
and drank of their horsipitality ony last Toosdav was a week.
Just one partin word of adwice to Mr. Cue. The werry wust way
to git a inwitashun to a reelly grand fust rate Bankwet, such as you
gits at—never mind where—is to go and complane to the noosepapers
as you ain't never asked, and the werry best way is to wait till it
cums natrally, witch it's sure to do if you 're the rite sort of fellow,
and then to make yourself so agreabel that you 're shore to be soon
wanted agane. w»
Two Speeches.—Hooray! he hasn't gone yet! Mr. Russell Lowell,

it spoke well for the vigour of our ancestors that 600 (founding of
Peterhouse) and 260 years ago (landing of Pilgrim Fathers), they
should have been able, on what was virtually the shortest day, to
have laid the foundation of a college, and the foundation of a mighty
empire." To lay a foundation on a day at all is wonderful, but on
the smallest day in the year is of oourse still more so.
Prince Edward got a laugh by regretting apologetically, in antici-
pation, his absence from the next centenary. Is this his first joke P
If so, very good, and perhaps there's more where that comes from.
We shall be happy to hear from His Royal Highness—occasionally.

The Imperial and Colonial Convention
My Lord, Society, New Guinea.
In reply to your Lordship's communication of the 15th ull.,
expressing, on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, a lively convic-
tion that the "best interests of all parties would be most efficiently
served by the entire absenoe of definite aim in negotiation, coupled
with a resolute avoidanoe of clearness and perspicuity, in the language
official or otherwise, in whioh the details of the question at issue
might happen to be discussed," I have now the honour to inform you
that it has come to the knowledge of this Society that a gunboat, Hy-
ing the colours of the Imperial German Navy, has been for some
time busily engaged along the whole of the coast of this extensive
and valuable Continent, as well as among the numerous rich and
productive neighbouring islands, and that there is every reason to
apprehend that unless some vigorous action is speedily taken, the
whole Archipelago, including New Scotland, Young Brompton, Old
Britain, West Putney, East Ireland, North Wales, Greater Brixton,
and some twenty-five other obviously natural British dependencies,
comprising together an area equal in extent to that of the united
Continents of Asia and South America, will pass suddenly into the
hands of some one of the more aggressive and ambitious European
Powers. Hoping to hear promptly from your Lordship on the matter,
as the situation, involving as it does the future of the whole Anglo-

Tour letter has been received by me, and, I feel I need hardly
assure you, has amused and interested me immensely. We are all
asking ourselves in this Department " what can that German cruiser
be up to?" Pray, therefore, make no sign; were you to do so you
might necessitate the use of plain-speaking on the part of somebody
(a thing highly to be deprecated in delicate situations), and spoil all
the fun! Begging you to be carefully on your guard to do Dothing,
and to feel assured that whatever happens, Her Majesty's Govern-
ment are fully prepared to give the matter their utmost oonsidt ration.

It is with profound regret, not unmingled with annoyance,
that I have to announce to y ou that yesterday evening the Captain
of the German cruiser suddenly producing from the hold of his
vessel a parcel containing a dozen of the national flag of his country,
proceeded to hoist one at this place, and at the same time announced
his intention of continuing the process at intervals in every direction
until he had exhausted his stock, and annexed tbe entire Continent.

Dear Sib, ^* Colonial Office.
I have the honour to acknowledge your communication of

pleased, but surprised me. The tact and discretion shown by the
German Commander in avoiding, while oarrying out a delicate
manoeuvre, anything like a rupture of those friendly relations that it
has always been the aim and hope of Her Majesty s Government to
cultivate and maintain with everybody and anybody, cannot be too
cordially acknowledged. With regard to "the future of the Anglo-
Saxon race," to whioh you so creditably refer, I have to direct your
attention to the fact that a mere question of detail such as this lies
distinctly outside th<* traditions of this Department. Requesting

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [Januabt 3, 1885.
MR. GREENHORN'S EXPERIENCES.
CHBI8TMAS BOIES.
I AM the fortunate possessor of a very rich Uncle, and for years he
has had the admirable custom of forwarding me a cheque of very
considerable amount as a Christmas Box. 1 regret to add that my
admirable Uncle, in addition to the possession of very considerable
wealth, is also the possessor, in a very considerable degree, of what
is generally denominated as humour, a quality in which I am abso-
lutely and entirely deficient, but which I do not at all regret, as it
seems to me to consist very largely in the Baying or doing of ill-
natured things which are intelligible only to the seleot few. As an
example of my rich Uncle's humour, 1 may mention, that happening
one day, just before Christmas-time last year, to be in his company,
the conversation turned upon the nuisance and annoyance of the
Christmas Box system prevalent in London, and several of the guests
having spoken strongly and emphatically in denunciation of what
they called the beggarly begging system, I naturally, but thought-
lessly, joined in, and added my little part to the general chorus. My
Uncle was a silent but evidently amused listener, and said, when we
parted, that my arguments had thoroughly convinced him of the truth
of what had been stated, and he complimented me very warmly on
my persuasive eloquence.
On the 24th of that same December, I received from my wealthy
Uncle, instead of the customary oheque on Coutts', a basket of game,
which he informed me, having been all shot by his own unerring
hand, I could probably oblige him by accepting, without any of that
feeling of degradation wbich I had so eloquently described as
accompanying the receipt of unearned money, under the disguise of
a Christmas Box.
Wondering whether my rioh Uncle's rich vein of humour could
possibly last more than twelve months, I waited with some con-
siderable degree of anxiety the arrival of the 24th of this present
month of December, when, to my intense surprise, I received by rail
a large and exceedingly heavy package, for the carriage of which I
had to pay the sum of 3s. 9d. Having, with some considerable diffi-
culty, opened this Pandora's Box, as I rather wittily called it, I
discovered, to my extreme disgust, that it contained about a scuttle-
full of coals, of a particularly dull-looking complexion, and a letter
from my wealthy Unola, informing me that, after the expenditure
of a vast deal of money, he had at length struck ooal, of which he
forwarded me the first specimen, and of which he desired to have
my candid opinion.
Recalling to mind the splendid cheque on Coutts', for which this
coally sample was but a melancholy substitute, I seized a nubbly
pieoe with the pair of tongs, placed it on my cheerful fire, and
patiently awaited the result. What was my astonishment to see
that, after a gallant attempt by his blazing neighbours to make
him one of themselves, they gradually ceased from the vain en-
deavour, and grew black, and dull, ana cheerless as he. Surprised
and disgusted, I seized the black poker, not the polished one, and
proceeded to inflict upon it very severe chastisement; but all in vain
—it calmly resisted my fiercest attack; and a second piece, tried as
a last despairing experiment, extinguished my defeated fire, and
sent me to bed angry and sneezing, and wondering what answer I
could possibly write to my wealthy Uncle that would be at all con-
sistent with truth, and yet not fatal to my natural expectations.

A DIFFICULT POST.
Amono the extraordinary wants that appear from time to time in the
advertisement columns of the Daily Telegraph, the following appears
to be especially remarkable :—
MATRON WANTED, to have charge of 20 rough girls, in laundry.
Must understand the work. Age about 35. Wages £18 to £25. Must
be total abstainer, high-principled, and able to assert authority.
To take charge of twenty rough girls in a laundry strikes us as
being a very arduous undertaking. Whv, these damsels might
smother the Matron in soap-suds, put her head in a blue-bag, dry
her with hot irons, or hang her with her own lines! It is all very
well to be high-principled, and to be able to assert authority.
But what is a poor Matron to do with twenty rough girls armed with
olothes-props? It strikes us very forcibly the good Lady would soon
get into hot water.
NEW YEAR OF OLD.
(A Duet of Other Days.)
"Around the hearth, in former times,
At wassail with their friends and kin.
Folks waked o'er midnight, while the ohimes
Rang Old Year out and New Year in.
It was merry in hall with Knight and Squire,
Where big logs blazed for lack of ooal,
And, roasted on a roaring fire,
The crabs were hissing in the bowl."
"Crabs roasted? How now! Say'st thou so P
'lis told that lobsters, boiling, scream;
An crabs hissed likewise, what a go,
To roast them living it would seem!"
"Nay, Sirrah, but thou dost misprize
A word in meaning not the true.
Thou art a Wag, or less than wise.
The crabs were crab-apples. Go to!"

I'm*

TWO CENTENARIANS.
Sis Moses Montbfiobb Congratulates the Tmsa on reaching,
its 100th Year.
NOTHING IF NOT CRITICAL.
With a charming naivete, Mrs. Kendal has recently been giving a
good deal of interesting information on the subject of Dramatic
Critioism to the "Interviewer " of an enterprising journal; and if
the fair and gifted Artiste be correct in her estimate of the present
condition of this speoial department of literature, it certainly would
seem to be in rather a bad way.
That a great Actor should nowadays be able to demoralise the
"Upper Ten of the Press" by " Capuan Suppers " is sad enough; but
still there is, it must be granted, about the gastronomic downfall of
these distinguished gentlemen a certain melancholy dignity. Nothing,
however, can be said in extenuation of the conduct of the representa-
tive of another, and it is to be presumed, less exalted olass of
journalism, whom Mrs. Kendal playfully gibbets under the name of
Mr. Sparkles." To ensure a laudatory notice of a new piece from
this venal and exacting personage, much art, discretion, temper, tact,
expense, and even serious inconvenience will have to be faced by any
high-class management. But that the feat is to be accomplished,
the following fly-leaf recording Mr. Sparkler's experiences of a
premiere, extracted from his own private diary, conclusively tes-
tifies :—
8'6. — Arrive at the Theatre one-and-twenty minutes late.
Thought so. They haven't dared to ring up without me. Halloa!
what s this? Why, if it isn't—the Guards Band in the Entrance,
playing, " iSee the Conquering Hero Comes," just as I step out of
my Hansom! Jackson, the Aoting-Manager, meets me, hat in hand,
and explains that they send their compliments, and hope I like the
Music on the stairs. Civil. Wonder what sort of a Box they've
given me. Ha! this isn't bad. The three next to the Stage on
Grand Tier all knocked into one. Notice a sofa-divan, seven easy
chairs, two tables (one laid), a mantelpiece with clock on it, several
genuine "Fbancatellis," an astronomioal telescope, hot India-
rubber water-bottle, and artistic display of fernery, with all daily
and weekly papers; in fact, everything to make one comfortable.
8"16.—Audience hissing a good deal because they don't begin.
Dear me, this is really meant very civilly. Man from neighbouring
Restaurant has just wheeled in a joint.to back of the Box, and says
he is requested to ask me, with compliments, whether I wouldn't
like a little something, just to keep me up after my cab-drive—just
one slice—before they begin." What is it? "Boiled pork, and
pease-pudding." Well, I don't know that I won't. Uproar in the
house. They send round "compliments," and wonder whether I
would mind eating through the First Aot. Not in the least. Tell
them " to begin, and not mind me."
9-17.—First Act over. Something in it. Like it. Almost as good
as that boiled pork. They have just sent round a dozen of stout
with " compliments" and want to know whether, as there is rather a
heavy set, I would like to take a little turn in a private coach and
four round Hyde Park in the dark and refresh myself. Send baok
to say " Thanks—but not now, I '11 let them know about it later."

10"5.—Second Act over. Publio seem to like it. Rather annoyed
at getting no message from "behind." Ha! ha! they had better
look out! Knock at the door. Good. It's all right! They've
sent round two barrels of oysters with a man to open them as fast as
I can eat them, and then compliments" and would I like to have
the Aoting-Manager in to do a little rough tumbling and conjuring,
at which ne is rather olever, at the back of the box to amuse me.
Accept the oysters. Aoting-Manager bad. Send him about his
business and, at his suggestion, have in the ophicleide from the
Guards Band to play a solo. A few cries of "OrderI" from the
house, but I get a kindly nod of encouragement through the
curtain. They evidently mean to be civil.
10"45.—Have finished the oysters, and at End of Aot Three, ac-
cepted invitation to go round "behind" and, carefully packed in
cotton wool, get into the costly and elaborate machinery and revolve
with it, partaking of bits of fresh pine-apple, bonbons, strawberry
ices, and petits verres of Chartrense in three colours, while its
purpose is explained to me by the " management," who follow me
about with a Surgeon from the Charing Cross Hospital, in case I
Btick. Again press me to have a turn somewhere in a four-horse
coach before last Act commences, and finally take a rush in a tandem
up Northumberland Avenue and back.
11*17.—Last Act in progress. Am smoking the second out of a
fine hundred of cigars I found waiting me, spread out in the front of
the Box on my return. Feel a little sleepy. "Kindest compli-
ments" sent round, to say they have noticed it from the Stage, and
would I like to have my hair cut, and be sprinkled with Eau de
Cologne, and be kept awake, "as it won't last very much longer," by
some good Stories that the Acting-Manager will be delighted to tell
me. Thoughtful. Pull myself together, and try to make out what
it's all about. Seems to be a costly and artistic revival of Macbeth.
M km . If there's a good feed after it's over, give 'em a lift? eh?
Capuan Banquet-
Press, and have a friendly little chat about it all—" quite sans
facon. Six-horse drag now waiting. By Jove, I '11 go, though—and,
though I didn't think muoh of his First Witch, if the Chateau Yquem,
1865, is good, he shall have a whole half oolumn to himself!
A CROWNING DIFFICULTY.
It having been definitely deoided at the latest'Bitting of the Berlin
Conference that the future form of Government of the New Central
African Association shall be " Monarohioal," and, as far as the idea
can be conveniently carried out, of the Newest Approved European
type, the following notes of a rough^draft scheme have already been
drawn up:—
1. The king shall be elected by the\Jfinor Purposes Committee.
(a) His income shall consist of 500 tons of ivory dust, oocoanut-
fibre, live performing camels, human bones, date jelly, hysena
skins, and unscented palm hair-oil, payable quarterly in
advance, and he shall have power (droit) to levy for arrears with
a tomahawk.
(6) He may take out a portable Palace, Circus, Italian Opera House
(with reduoed prices), and five dozen lamp-posts with him; but,
in the event of there being no Capital to reoeive him, he will be
expected to find his own.
(c) An eleven months' residence in the basin of the Upper Congo
will be regarded as the minimum of his annual presence on the
spot, and, owing to the natural advantages of the situation, he
will not be required to put his washing out.
2. The Candidates eligible for the post will be (a) the Emperor of
Germany, (6) the Emperor of Austria, (c) the King of the Bel-
gians, (d) the King of Italy, (e) the Emperor of Russia.
3. In the event, which is not probable, of the crown being refused by
all of the above Royal and Imperial personages, it will he offered to
(a) Mr. Sanger, (b) the Representative of Messrs. Ceosse and
Blackwell, (c) the Lama of Thibet, {d) Mr. J. L. Toole.
4. In the further improbable event of one, or even all four of these
gentlemen together, declining to go out and see how they like it
(leur convient), just for a month (un mois seul), then it shall be
thrust on some distinguished ticket-of-leave man by private pres-
sure (force majeure), and he shall be required to finish out his
legal term on half-salary, dividing the balance among the acting
Committee of Appointment.
5. In the still further and more improbable event of the new king,
however chosen, being suddenly eaten, together with the rest of
his dynasty, by his subjects in a fit of popular enthusiasm, it shall
then be competent for the Committee of Appointment to recon-
sider the above constitutional scheme, and advertise occasionally
in some widely read weekly paper for an elderly, amiable, con-
fiding, and eligible substitute.

THE MANHOOD OF GREAT BOYS.
Most boys are familiar with virtuous little books which instruct them about
the Boyhood of Great Men. They are well aware of Nelson's want of acquaint-
ance with Fear, and his interview with the Polar Bear, and they know about
George Washington and his little Axe, and the Young Spartan who fed the
Stolen Fox on Black Broth, while he himself dined luxuriously on Sea Urchins
and Garum. But the moral lessons of the Manhood of Great Boyt have still to
be drawn. Perhaps they serve rather as warnings than attractions, but they
are none the less valuable and salutary, especially as they are seldom or never
derived from classical life, but from the palpitating present. By way of
improving the holiday season, too often spent thoughtlessly (like pocket-money),
we publish one or two briei Biographical sketches of the Manhood of Great
Boys.
I.—The Humorist.
There never was a greater Boy than Peter Platful. His mind was always
full of fun, and his pockets of squirts, squibs, whistles, pea-shooters, and other
allied forms of wit and humour. He was famous for his Practical Puns, where
the joke consisted in doing the right thing to the wrong person; for example,
in sending in his pastry-cook's bill to his Form-master, by way of Greek prose,
while he would endeavour to satisfy his Tradesman with an exercise on the
Life and Adventures of Balbus. He would fill letter-boxes with orange-;
and use the letters which he had been given to post, in the manufac
paper-boats on the Bound Pond.
When he grew up to be a (University) Man, Peter would play at being
Proctor, with some of his friends disguised as Bull-dogs, and it made great
mirth when he met the real Prootor, and asked him for his Name and College.
As Peter was smoking at the time, the Proctor did not fail to see the joke,
but, being of a jealous temper, he caused Peter to be removed from Oxford.
Peter then desired to be a Successful Merchant, like Mr. Samuel Budge,
but, as he still remained at heart a Great Boy, he did not become Lord Mayor.
For example, when in the Coal Business Peter would
send his customers slates, instead of Best Wallsend,
and, when in the Wine Trade, he would playfully substi-
tute logwood and potato spirit, for very curious tawny
old Port, and extremely clean and nutty Sherry, while
he would insist on putting a few "surprise cigars"
(which exploded when ignited) in every box of Havannas.
By his happy boyish ways, and his habit of paying
everyone with what he called "Sell Cheques "—drawn
on Banks where he had no account—Peter made many
friends, but he was too gay and generous for business,
and became quite poor. He did not inherit his old Aunt's
money, because he once sent her a hamper full of live
rats for a Christmas Present, "as he knew she was fond
of animals."
At last Peter had to spend his Christmas Eve in the
Workhouse, where, however, he would have had a good
dinner next day. But, being unable to resist the desire
to make a booby trap for the Chaplain, Peter was shut
up alone in a cell, with only skilly, instead of roast
beef and plum pudding for his Christmas Dinner. As
the other Paupers went past the cell to their nice meal,
they heard Peter Playful singing " Oft in the Skilly
Night" which shows us that a Great Boy can be happy
while many another man would feel quite sad and cheer-
less.
II.—The Inventor.
Thomas Treadwell was always reckoned a very In-
genious Boy. While still very young, seeing other boys
with boats, while he had none, he converted his Sunday
hat into a circular iron-clad, with a newspaper for a
sail—and his barque behaved nobly. Thomas also con-
verted the mainspring of his father's watch into ma-
chinery for the lock of a brass cannon, and, being in
need of a saw, made a very fine one with his father's
razor, which he nicked in the edge with a piece of the
drawing-room window-pane.
Come to Manhood, Thomas remained a Great Boy, and
laid out all his property on his own useful inventions.
He discovered a machine for writing Leading Articles,
but this only only caused him to be hated and insulted
by the Gentlemen whom his cleverness deprived of their
livelihood. Later, Thomas devised a mechanical Member
of Parliament for the Representation of Minorities. This
was a great saving of trouble, as the mechanical Mem-
ber, on being wound up, almost always went into the
right Lobby and voted straight, while the Government
of the day, by regulating the works, oould make him
alter his oourse in any direction. Finally Thomas pro-
duced and patented two mechanical self-feeding Waste-
paper Baskets, with dust-bins complete, which he pro-
posed to substitute for the Colonial and Foreign Oflioes.
About this invention he received a most flattering letter
from Prince Bismarck, who said that he found these
new inventions quite equal to the old-fashioned English
articles then in use. But public prejudice was stirred
up against Thomas, and the War Office neglected his
plan for "giving the enemy snuff " in patent soft-coated
explosive shells, recommended by the Peace Sooiety.
By this time the money of Thomas was spent, and he
had to develope his Self-steering Dynamic Balloon in
the retirement of Colney Hatch, where he is one of the
most respected inmates. Parents and Guardians will
observe the results in the way of honours and rewards,
that may be won by encouraging inventiveness in the
young.
UPSIDE DOWN.
We are so familiar at least with the names of our
Colonies, that we are apt to forget the varied conditions
among which our kinsmen live. We talk of Australia,
Queensland, and Canada as if they were Kensington,
Fulham, or the new Parliamentary Borough of 8t.
George's-in-the-East. It is well to be occasionally
reminded, as we are by the telegram from Queensland
which the Agent-General published the other day, that
things are not as they seem. Amongst the items of
intelligence given it is telegraphed: "Parliament pro-
rogued Governor yesterday." Now here, as everyone
knows, it is the Governor (the Queen) who prorogues
Parliament. At the Antipodes things are naturally
just the reverse, and it is the Parliament that prorogues
the Governor. A strange World, my Masters.!

Alas! the adage-mongers fib.

With sinuous spine, with pliant rib;

But stops in awe, poor timid minx,

'TIS COURTESY MAKES THE MAYOR TO GO.
A VKKY remarkable example of courtesy is reported from Liver-
pool. The Liverpool Daily Post, which is properly enthusiastic on
the matter, says:—
"One of the many instances of the Mayor's (Mr. David Badcliffb's)
courtesy was shown to the Deputation from the General and Sub-post Offices,
which waited upon him at the Town Mall on Monday. The Mayor presented
each of the Deputation with a Cabinet Photograph of himself; and it is need-
less to say this signal kindness has been greatly esteemed."
"Signal kindness " is rather a poor and inadequate way of alluding
to this action on the part of the Mayor of Liverpool. It is prodigious.
We trust it will prove that Mr. Radcxiffe has not only done good
himself, but has been the cause of others doing good. We can
imagine nothing more pleasing, or indeed more elevating, than to be
the recipient of a Mayor's Photograph, cabinet size. Lord Mayor
Nottaoe may, from delicacy of feeling that will be understood and
appreciated, hesitate to follow the example. But to Mayors in other
towns we commend it.
WAS IT VERY COLD?
The day after .Mr. Gladstone's seventy-fifth birthday—there is
no other date known in a liberal computation of time,— The
Standard had this paragraph—
"Mr. Gladstonb seemed as fresh and as hale as he has done at any period
during the last four years, and faced the biting easterly wind at eight o'clock
in the morning with no other protection than that afforded by a shawl loosely
thrown over his shoulders."
Nothing but a shawl loosely thrown over his shoulders! Good
gracious! The Premier was very nearly affording a representation
of the First Gentleman in the World as he appeared on quitting Eden.
And Police surveillance has been entirely withdrawn, or partially
modified! Odd!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TWO SHARPS AND ONE FLAT.
One of the most delightful hooks we've come across for some time
is Sketching Rambles in Holland, hy G. H. Boughton, A.R.A., and
E. A. Abbey. The Sauce Hollandaise with this dish is indeed
excellent. It is beautifully got up by Macmillan & Co., the repro-
duction of the sketches being simply perfect. The two collaborateurs
drew one another occasionally; and Mr. J. E. Rogers, not mentioned
on the title-page, draws a picture which he calls "part of the Abbey."
He has not done " part of the Boughton," as the latter appears to
have done his own part himself, and done it so well and such a lot

as a Dutch Skipper might do—that is "skipping"—yet we do not
remember having ever alighted on the name of J. E. Rogers any-
where except in the list of illustrations. No doubt we 're wrong,
but no matter for that, it's the best book on Dutch land, Dutch life
and manners and customs, that any intending traveller in these
parts could wish for, and if we 're wrong, then all we can say is that
we 're a Dutchman,—a double one, of course.
But don't they both of them natter the women? They do—and
quite right too—that's the way to get on; and then, no doubt,
they 're going " bock ag^en," and these little compliments will be of
use to them. Besides, isn't Holland a country that might be "let
out in flats P" Not that flat is the character of the people. No,
sharp's the word. An Englishman staying in France becomes plus
Francois que Francois; and so between these two artistic companions
there was perpetual emulation when in Holland, which is the flat test
of places, as to which should be the flatterer. This is clearly the
secret of the beautiful Dutchesses whose charming portraits are to
be seen in this book. To our thinking, speaking for Mr. Punch, it
is the best Christmas, New Year's, or any other Season's present
that can be given. Oet it.
LETTERS TO SOME PEOPLE.
My Dear Mr. Harry Payne,
On the first night' of the Pantomime, it was not until half-
past eleven that I beheld "your beautiful red and white complexion,
the visible evidenoe of a Clown's perfect state of health, saw the
movements of your mo-
bile countenance, and
heard you observe that
you and several other
people were there onoe
more. But my feelings
of joy were alloyed with
(if you will allow me to
make this witty remark,
probably for the first
time) some "pain" on
noticing that directly
you had said "Here we
are again I" the majority
of the Audience in the
Stalls and Dress Circle
seemed to retort, "No,
we 're not!" by getting
up, putting on their
cloaks and wrappers, and
hurrying out.
The younger Children
were dead tired, and Old
Boys were athirst. For
my part, I would have
given anything to have
been allowed to witness
what are called the
"Comic Scenes," which
of course are intended to
be a relief to the first
part of the entertain-

The Guiding Stars.
ment, which is always so intensely tragic, but I was removed by
superior force.
It went to my heart to tear myself away, and I could not bear
the thought of your having sat out in the cold, so to speak, all
through those thirteen or fourteen scenes, waiting for hours to come
on and exclaim, "Here we are again!" I wonder you didn't cry
out, "Here we are at last!" I believe you would have made a
distinot hit had you done so. No matter, if the same thing occurs
next year, say it then.
Augustus Druriolanus is the Lorenzo the Magnificent of the
Stage : and Chabies, his brother, is his true friend and assistant—the
bashful, shy, retiring Charles, who, on Boxing Night, when dragged
out of some mysterious hiding-place by the energetio and splendidly-
attired Manager, appeared in a working dress, bashfully cowering
before the enthusiastically applauding audience, as though he had
done something wrong, and was in dumb show begging everybody's
pardon, and imploring his brother to let him off this onoe, and he'd
never do it again.
The most original effect is in the First Scene, my dear Mr. Harry

Payne. The Five Senses oome on, represented by Ears, Noses,
Mouths with tongues out, Eyes and Hands, all dancing about
separately, each on his own account. As long as these capital
Masks last, Messrs. Labb:art and F. Burdett, they won't be out
of their Senses at Old Drury. These Senses all combine, and make
several faces (very rude of them) in sight of the Audience. It
was the first hit, and it was irresistible.
The next great hit was Mr. Laurie as The Cat; and, to celebrate
his praises, would require the genius of a Laurie-ate, when he isn't
writing " Becket."

child in London but must see these little dears in their night-
dresses, dancing, and enjoying themselves thoroughly. Kattie
Lanner's is the real Infant School of Dramatic Art.
Of course, my dear Sir, while awaiting your turn, you did not see
the Grand Ballet scene. It is dazzlingly brilliant, and the dancing
by Mdlles. Pertoldi and Zanfretta is perfect in toe-toe. The last
big hit which knocked me over entirely was the Lord Mayor's Show.
The idea of making the shields and arms of the various Municipal
Guilds and Corporations into living, moving, and dancing figures, is
most ingenious; and seeing that every sort of political satire is
allowed in the Candidate,—and probably several are subsequently
given by yourself, Mr. Harry, in your comic scenes with telling
effect,—-1 cannot understand why the Home Secretary was not
brought on in that scene to step a lively measure with the Heraldic
Dragons, as lively a measure, at all events, as his own Municipal
Reform Bill. No doubt Sir W. V. Harcourt will go in state to see
it, and be admitted to the procession on the stage with the Lord
Mayor Nottagb himself, who, if it is very cold weather, might have
a scene on the ice with Sir William, and show him how to
"keep the pot a bilin'," on one of his own Stereoscopic Company's
slides.
I must not forget the sylph-like ^Enea, flying gracefully as ever in
the air, walking daintily on the Children's out-stretched hands, and
perching lightly on their heads. What do these little mites think of

little Kattie Lamers have no terrors whatever. What, hereafter,
will travellers' tales be to these

years old, they have seen with their
own very eyes?

described as "Messrs. Nicholls,
Campbell & Co., with Powers to

suit them of course so much
better than what the fanciful
Author has been at some pains to
write for them. I'm afraid Miss
Fanny Leslie has been trying
her voice too much, though she is as
sprightly as ever as Whittington.
You should try and see her with Alice in the pretty farewell scene.
Also, my dear Mr. Habry, stop at the wing one night, and listen
to Miss Kate Munroe singing ner Nightingale Trill Song. Its

The Pantomime is, on the whole,
about the most gorgeous spectacle
ever yet seen on this or any other

admirably painted. Mr. Bever-
ley takes the audience by storm,

that his graceful and artistic
fancy should be conspicuous by its
absence from the Transformation.
I am told there's a tremendous
run on the seats, which the
Manager must stop if it's done

crowded, that there's small chance
of your inimitable comic scenes
being witnessed by your friend
and admirer, Nibbs.
P.S. — Wllliam the Silent's
Show at Covent Garden was
thronged on Boxing Night, a most
appropriate evening for Athletes
to revel in the Prize Ring. There
are eighteen Clowns!—this results
from a dearth of Pantomimes.

SAD CASE OF STATUE.
The Achilles Statue (so called) in Hyde Park is reported to be in a
bad way:—
"In the calf of the right leg there is a great gash, several inches long, and
an inch or more wide. The bronze is completely severed, with the hollow
interior of the leg laid open. For some time past the aperture has been
growing and widening; and it threatens to entirely destroy the leg, if not
to cause a complete collapse of the Statue."—Letter to the Times.
JEre perennius f Not the molten image in the deplorable condi-
tion above described. But that is not the form of a man of metal,
strong and solid, but, as the boy calls bis twopenny jam-puff, deficient
in jam, a hollow humbug. No wonder that its leg has got laid open,
and that its entire system is in such a state that it stands in need of
surgery. Perhaps, indeed, it may be past that, but whether or no,
St. George's Hospital being close at hand, it might be taken there,
by order of the proper Authority, to ascertain what the surgeons say.
The Bishop of Oxford wants Vivisectionists to be logical, which
is asking them to be better than himself. This is true humility.
The Bishop wants to know if those who vivisect an animal for a given
purpose, would vivisect a man? Certainly. Holding as we do that,
under certain clearly-defined and stringent restrictions, it is expedient
and lawful to vivisect animals, we would even go so far in our un-
relenting logic as to viviseot a Bishop, not qua Bishop, but in the event
of his ever reducing himself to the level of the brute creation, or, in
plain language, should he on any occasion make an ass of himself.

A NEW USE FOR OLD CARDS.
Christmas and New Year Cards, which have served one good
turn in conveying good wishes at the season of good-will, may, it
appears, serve another turn at least equally good, by being utilised
for the Scrap-books for poor and sick children, which the Children's
Scrap Book Mission distributes in thousands amongst the Homes and
Hospitals of London. There is a kindly economy here which com-
mends itself to Mr. Punch's child-loving heart. Perhaps even the
overworked Postmen might less complain did they know that their
backs ached, not only to convey more or less formal greetings, and—
as it is to be feared, is too often the case—to flatter vanity, but to
brighten the lonely and painful hours of poor sick Children. The
Secretary of the Children's Scrap-book Mission " will gladly receive
contributions of old Christmas and New Year Cards at the address of

Oh, your object pretty plain is,

But swallowing's not digesting, as one day you may confess.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A DREAM OF UNFAIR TRADE.
(A Long Way after the Laureate.)

"Oh, don't we know the Middle-man,
The Middle-man, the Middle-man I"
I bead before my eyelids dropt their
shade,
That wondrous Wealth of Nations,
long ago
Writ by great Adam Smith, he who
first made
Trade's nature known below.
And for awhile the feeling of his
truth
Cheered me, as one who haven gladly
hails
Anon the stir of sympathy and ruth
At human woes and wails
Suffused mine eyes with tears. O'er all
the land
Which economic lore LUumineth,
I witnessed Toil with Sorrow hand-in-
hand,
And Poverty, and Death.
And spite of Free-Trade facts and fiscal
proofs,
I saw large crowds in pauper sanc-
tuaries,
And smokeless chimneys towering o'er
the roofs
Of silent factories.
At length I saw a Lady within call.
Stiller than grave Minerva standing
there,
A daughter of Urania, god-like tall,
And classically fair.
And then a low voice, oharged with
brooding care,
Murmured beside me, "Turn and
look on me.
I am that Trade which men called Free
{not' Fair'),
If what I was I be.
"I had great power, millions lipped my
name.
My wholesome sway appeared man's
destiny.
Champions espoused my cause, where-
e'er I came
I brought prosperity."
"No marvel, sovereign Lady, ia fair
field
Myself thy championship had
gladly tried,"
I answered bold, and, turning, I
appealed
To one who stood beside.
But she, with hot and angry looks
averse,
To her full height her swelling sta-
ture draws.
"The land," she said, "is blighted
with a curse—
This creature is the cause."
"In vain I speak, and strive to raise
new cries
Of Tariff-war and Reciprocity:
The stern Economists with wolfish
eyes
Stand by to watch me die."
Whereto that other, with unshrinking brow:—
"No matter what fools do beyond the foam,
For those who wield the hammer, hold the plough—
I'm best for all at home."
Then loud out spake a man of spacious size,
Broad-cloth'd, with crimson neck-scarf neatly
rolled,
A fellow with red cheeks and cold grey eyes,
Chinking a bag of gold.
He. tipping me a cunning wink, began:—
I govern Mart and 'Change, 1 long have swayed
All Markets. For I am the Middleman,
That Incubus of Trade.
"Profits 1 intercept, 'tis thus I climb
On Fortune's neck, I'm a mon<
The markets rise and fall at any
Obedient to my nod.
"Catch me—Trade's weasel—sleeping? Not a bit 1
I track, spring, fasten, suck Trade's very life;
Between producer and consumer sit.
Like Shyhck with his knife.
"Beady to cut here—there. In war's alarm,
'Midst general loss my profits I espy;
And 'midst closed ports and the loud clash of arms,
I thrive whilst thousands die.
l\Punch pictured me as I may now be found,
Bringing to British shores the foreign prows.
Trade (Eolus am I, the winds all round
Bring profit to my house.
"Free Trade? Fair Trade? Aha! What's in a name P
Imports untaxed / tithe, yet do not fear
Protective tariffs. No, it's all the same
To me, my lad. Look here!"
(With that he opened up his bag, and half
The glittering gold of the contents to sight
Laid bare; thereto he pointed with a laugh
Of cynical delight.)
• • • » •
Slowly I waked. Then said I, "I have heard
The noise of rival parties,—overborne
By one who crows loud as the crested bird
That rouses us at morn.
The doctrinaires may argue long and well,
Their oraggy dogmas mouthing late and soon,
But Labour's under some unhappy spell,
There's something out of tune.
Protection's nonsense—that is understood,
It cannot help our Toilers anyway
To mook their myriad mouths with dearer food.
No—that device won't pay!
But empty factories and idle hands,
The waste of native manhood's power and pith,
Are cureless by oheap goods from foreign lands,
Or truths from Adam Smith.
"Yet tears to human suffering are due,"
Sings stoic Wobdsworth. Ay, and more than tears:
The helpful labours of the thoughtful few,
Sagaoity that steers
'Twixt pedant rule and purblind prejudice,
Not servile to old saw or centuned maxim,

Home-trade upholstered by Protection's ban,;

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [January 10, 1885.

BETROTHAL OF PRINCESS BEATRICE.
Beatrice. So, Battenberg, Love on; I will requite thee I
For others sat thou dost deserve ; and I
Believe it better than reportinoly.
Much Ado about Nothing, Act iii., Sc. L
"I PROMESSI SPOSI."
[The Court Circular announces that the
Queen has given her consent to the
betrothal of Princess BEATRICE to
Prince Henry of Battenberg.]
Auspicious news to greet the young
New Year!
Punch gives it in his pages first of
places.
Sore this Court Circular should catch
the ear
Of listening liases and attendant
Graces.
This knits the golden circle sweetly
up,
And brims with joy the Royal
Mother's Cup.
Therein the amari aliquid, on sooth,
Hath surged amidst love's sweet-
ness all too often.
But the glad ring of fair and hopeful
youth
Surrounding honoured age such
pangs must soften.
May Heaven keep it, like true lover's
token,
For many nappy years bright and
unbroken.
To him who takes therein his place
to-day,
Prince Henry, Punch a hearty
hand extends;
Whilst as for her, the Widowed
Sovereign's stay,
Truest of children, faithfullest of
friends,
Sweet Beatrice, the whole land prays
her life.
As daughter loyal, may be glad as
Wife!
Boys Tog other.—The Managers
of the Boys' Public School Company,
advertise for a Master, to whom thev
offer a fixed salary. "In addition,"
so the advertisement runs, a " capita-
tion grant of £1 will be given for
every pupil over fifty." This looks
well on paper. But the offer seems
illusory. It is quite true that Mr.
Bultitude, a gentleman something
over fifty, went to school. But the
action was quite involuntary on his
part, and after his experience it is
not likely, even suppose a Master
were to share the capitation grant
with them, that many middle-aged
gentlemen would be .inclined to join
the boys' classes.
INNS AND OUTS.
Mr. Babtle Fef.rf. the Solicitor recently addressed a letter to the
papers d propos of the proposed dissolution of the Inns of Chancery,
pointing out the right of the possessor to deal at his pleasure with
his possession, or, to put it in a colloquial form, "to do just what he
likes with his own." No doubt Mr. Babtle Frere is right, still, if
the idea were carried out thoroughly "to the bitter end, the result
would be far from pleasant. Leaving out of the question the
niceties of incorporation and other matters more easily comprehended
by the lights of the profession, to the junior branch of which Mr.
Bartle Frere belongs, than by the Public at large, we might soon
read the following under the heading of—
The Latest Legal Intelligence.
The Benchers of Gray's Inn, at a recent Pension, expended the
whole of the funds of their Hon. Society in purchasing port for their
own private consumption.
The Treasurer of Lincoln's Inn has mortgaged the freehold ground
upon which the Hall stands, in order to raise funds for purchasing
fireworks to be displayed in the adjacent fields on the occasion of his
birthday. •
The Treasurer of the Middle Temple has let out the gardens
belonging to his Inn on a building lease so as to enlarge and cement
the lawn-tennis grounds now in the occupation of the Junior Briefless
Bar.
The Benchers of the Inner Temple have sold their library, and
propose to utilise the purchase-money in prosecuting a search into
the pedigrees of certain of their fellow members who claim lineal
descent from the Ancient Kings of Ireland.
The Ancients of Staples Inn have decided to settle the proceeds of
the sale of their property upon Sir Charles Dllke (in recognition of
his kind intentions) for life, with remainder to the Members of
Barnard's Inn and others with whom they have not the slightest
connection.
Was there ever a better name for a mistaken Editor of a revised
Shak8Peare than Dr. Mull P At first sight it looks like a joke,
but the work he has produced, judging it by a review in the Times,
is evidently no joke. Dr. Mathias Mull is a fact.

A PSALM OF LIFE.
(As exhibited in Christmas Annuals.)
Tell me not, 0 Soul that slumbers,
"Life is placid, Life is pale!"
'lis not so in Christmas Numbers;
There quite other views prevail.
Life is foaming, Life is frantic,
Here the dagger, there the bowl;
"Stick at nothing that's romantic!"
Says my Printer to my Soul.
Not to live as boys and girls would
Is our men's and maidens' way;
But to act as if in Earlswood
You might find them any day!
Write of fire, and flood, and battle,
Write of Earls that gaily sin,
Write of Governesses,—that '11
firing the sweet subscribers in!
Lives of Great Highwaymen show it,
How to make our tales sublime;
Bother sense and grammar! Go it—
Give us something new in Crime!
Crimes that ne'er, perchance, another,
As he reached his volume's end,
Dreamed of—give us these, my brother.
Something fresh in guilt, my friend!
Let us then be up and raving,
Rave of ghosts, and sin, and fate;
These the gentle reader's craving,
And he does not like to wait!
A Book to Britain.—For one method of dealing with
Dynamitard plotters, " A Liberal M.P." recommends
in the Times "the extension to the United Kingdom of
some of the drastic powers of the Irish Crimes Preven-
tion Act." An admirable suggestion. Grant England the
same protection of life and property as that which Ireland
enjoys. Then Hibernia and Britannia will be equal before
the law; and sure won't that be a mighty satisfactory
? Justice to Ireland?

THE SERVANTS."
Applicant for Cook's Place. "I 've always been in Fam'lies where Four
Servants is eep', M'um—which I mus' say, M'dm, I likes my Rubber in
THE HSVBNINO!!"
UTOPIAN JONES.
If the "Dramatic Outlook" is not better than Mr. Hugh Thomsons
illustrations to this article in The English Illustrated Magazine this
month, the Actors and Authors had better " look put" for themselves.
All the characters represented are meant for likenesses, at least so
we are led to infer from the names which the Artist has most con-
siderately written beneath every picture, so that there may be no
sort of doubt in the spectator's mind either as to the Actor for whom
it is intended, or as to the character in which he is represented. The
best is Mr. Tree as Macari.
As far as we've read Mr. Jones's lecture on the Drama, he seems
to have left out of the question all consideration of the Ufaut vivre
argument, which compels the humble playwright to do what he can
get to do, and not what he would prefer doing. When a Dramatic
Author has made a fortune, he can then piok and choose his subjects,
his Actors, and his Theatre; but so long as he has to keep the pot
boiling, almost any sort of stuff that comes to hand may be used for
fuel. He and his have to live, though of this no one sees the absolute
necessity except himself and those who depend on his exertions:
but it is quite enough for them to see'.it, and he has to live for them!
An Author may "respect himself and his Art" as much as Mr.
Jons (part Author of The Silver King and sole Author of Saints and
Sinners] could desire: but if there were a "prize of ten thousand
pounds in the gutter," which he could get by scrambling for it, he'd
scramble; and, if he be the father of a family, he would be a culpable
fool if he didn't scramble, and do his very best to get it. And sup-
posing this prize of " ten thousand pounds in the gutter," and all the
authors, impressed by Mr. Jones's high-falutin' teaching, turning up
their noses at it, is anyone so simple as to imagine that the guileless
Jones wouldn't be down in that gutter before Mr. Herman or Mr.
Wells could say " Knife 1" and nave picked up that ten-thousand-
pound prize without any scrambling at all? Of course he would, and
quite right, too, bless him! Let's all cock our noses in the air,
disdain earth, and open our mouths for the larks, roasted whole, to
tumble into them.
No, thank you, talented Author of Saints and Sinners, but at all
events Dramatic Authors will not ask you to join in the scramble, and
will be only too delighted if you will be satisfied when your "honest
work shall be fairly valued''—what does Mr. Jones mean by "honest
work ?"—" and shall buy him (Mr. Jones) honest bread and cheese."
What is " honest bread and cheese P" Unadulterated P Why, this is
the "horny-handed son of toil" claptrap. However, if Mr. Jones
the Dramatist is content with his "honest bread and cheese," so be
it, only with the honest bread give us the equally honest haunch of
mutton. Mr. Jones doesn't mention anything to drink with his
bread and cheese, so we may suggest for him the pure and filtered
water, and for ourselves the honest" fizz,"—whereat we believe even
the austere Dramatist's " honest phiz " would become radiant.
When we hear it asked why doesn't Smith the Dramatist write
something original instead of adapting from the French or German,
or why doesn't Brown (who obtained a Horseseholarship and the
Buffoon prize) go in for something better than foolish Extrava-
ganzas, farcical pieces, and Burlesques, which make thousands
Faugh (the idiots!), we say to ourselves, probably poor Smith and
Brown have large families to support who depend on the bread-
winner's play-wnghting work for their daily food, clothing, and
schooling; and Smith would be an ass if he refused a commission
to adapt a French play for which he may get money enough to
keep him and his for the next half-year; and Brown would be a
culpable donkey were he to discontinue hu work which, doing no
harm beyond amusing those who like being amused by songs and
dances and fantastical nonsense, supplies him and his with the neces-
saries of life, and, if he is very lucky, with a few of the luxuries,—
occasionally.
Of course, would we were all Joneses the Virtuous and Highly
Artistic, but as we can't be that, let some of us thank Heaven we
are ordinary Smiths and Browns, and do our work "in that
station of life to which it hath pleased," &c, &c, for which over-
haul your catechism, and when found, make a note of.

AN EARLY BIRD ON THE TURF.
Earl Cadooan contributes to the Fortnightly an
Article on "The State of the Turf," which is of con-
siderable interest to outsiders. According to the noble
Author, the state of the Turf at the present moment is
such as to require a good deal of cutting, watering, and
levelling, to render it perfectly smooth. To keep the
Turf in good condition for racing is the self-imposed
duty of the Jockey Club, which, being a Society un-
recognised by law, has considerable difficulty in enforcing
obedience to its own rules and regulations. This body
has to obtain the " good-will" of local Magistrates before
dealing with any " fixtures." Lord Cadogan is in favour
of gate-money, and remarks that, as to "the argument
that Racing should be provided gratuitously for the
multitude, it is enough to say that such a demand has
never been advanced in connection with any other sport
or pastime." The Earl should not have said never," but
"hardly ever." For ourselves we object to gate-money,
and always want to go in for nothing, but the Turf is not
so green as that comes to, and at Sandown they are much
too Sandowny to be let in themselves, or to let in any-
one else. Of course a charge is made for admission to
Lords and elsewhere to see a Cricket-match, and
Cricket is a national pastime; but how about Boat-
racing—which is as national and rational a sport as
Horse-racing? This is pretty well open to the public,
and in consequence of there being no gate-money, there's
a considerable run on every bank. The Jockey Club
labours under "the serious difficulty " of not being able
to take evidence on oath. Mr. Bradlaugh wouldn't
admit the seriousness of this difficulty. Certainly any
statement about the Turf ought to be sward to. (Ahem .')
In sum, the Earl thinks that the mission of the Jockey
Club is to put down the gamblers and make a change
for the better. Long may he remain above the Turf to
be an ornament to it.
The Law of Liquidation — wiR very soon assert
itself should a heavy snow-storm be followed by a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MANHOOD OF GREAT BOYS.
III.—The Statesman.
Even among: Boys, "William Pltaht was remarkable for the
fertility and ingenuity of his apologies and excuses. If late for
dinner, or chapel, he never contented himself with the frivolous and
outworn allegation that he had accidentally thrust his right-hand
foot into his left-hand shoe, and had been unable to extricate it in
time. He would observe, on the contrary, with deep and engaging
penitence, that he had become so absorbed in the delightful argu-
ments of a Euclid, or in the masterly intricacies of the Greek irregu-
lar verb, that the hour for refreshment or devotion had stolen by
unobserved. His masters were so greatly impressed at once with
the dialectical ingenuity of William, and with the eloquence in
which he olothed his thoughts, that they frequently requested him
to remain after the other lads had gone to play, and in solitary,
and even laborious interviews, devoted themselves to eultivating
William's sense of rectitude.
At home it was the same thing. "William, did you break that
window?" his Father would inquire, bluntly; and William
would, with patient subtlety, reply (in the very words of an eminent
writer) that there are people in the world who are very fond of
asking what they call point-blank questions. They profess to hate
all shilly-shallying, and they are at no pains to hide their suspicion
that any one who declines to say Yes or No to any question which
they choose to ask, has either his intellect clouded by Metaphysics,
or has not the courage of his opinions." William would then go on
to remark that breaking a window was not such a simple matter as, on
a superficial view, it appeared. A stone broke the window—he was
not a stone. Was, then, the actual or the impelling agency to be
regarded as the proximate or the efficient cause of the domestic
disaster P Again,he urged, there was the question of the direction of
the intention. He had intended "but here his Father seized Wil-
liam, and (in spite of his clamouring that " Force was no Remedy ")
proceeded to correct him with the library ruler, whioh happened to be
handy. Thus eminent as a Boy, William naturally looked forward
to distinction in political life. Nor was he disappointed. William
soon became indispensable to his Party. Night after night did his
opponents ask William ill-natured questions, all of which he
answered at the greatest length, and in language of extreme pro-
priety, and rhythmical structure. His clumsy adversaries, indeed,
complained that, when William at length sat down, they were no
better informed than they had been when he arose. Yet so remark-
able was his art that, whenever William had to make a speech, the
House was crowded. Everyone listened with all his ears, adversaries
were infuriated, friends cheered to the echo, but the extraordinary
thing was that, in the morning, no mortal could ever tell what it all
meant, or what William really intended. _ Thus the qualities whioh
had attracted persecution, ignominy, oanings, fifth-form lickings,
and other accidents to William in his boyhood, became of the
utmost value to him as a Statesman.
Finally, however, his country was involved in foreign affairs of
peculiar difficulty. William occupied the Antarctic Regions with
a force of thirty Marines, and allotted to his country the interest on
the Polar debt. Immediately all the Foreign Powers, including
Bolivia and Venezuela, sent letters to William, asking him what the
dickens he meant by his conduct, and whether he intended to annex,
administer, or evacuate the Antarctic Circle? To those missives
William replied, for several years, in his usual courteous manner,
but with the unfortunate effect of driving all the nations of the
world, including Zanzibar, quite mad, and into an offensive alliance
against his country. William, therefore, crowned with honours,
withdrew from affairs, and devoted his leisure to deciphering Jebusite
Inscriptions. These remarkable relics of antiquity resemble an ill-
advised attempt to draw tables and chairs, and, as only two syllables
of the Jebusite language are known (and these incorrectly) the topio
afforded ample scope for William's undeniable ingenuity. He has
I now translated the Inscriptions in twelve totally different ways,
| and, having sufficiently contributed to the elucidation of politics,
means to publish his discoveries, one of whioh, out of the twelve, he
thinks is nearly certain to be regarded as, at least, approximately
plausible. We thus learn that qualities which, in Youth, are often
discouraged, may lead to the highest political and philological emi-
nence in maturer years.
TV.—The Merchant.
At school, Goboius Midas, though, in some ways, a service-
able, was not a popular boy. He was very greedy, but chiefly
satisfied his love of good things by violently appropriating the
hampers of his juniors in the Lower Fourth, for he never rose above
that insignificant degree of soholasticpromotion. Yet Gormus was use-
ful for, when all the other boys had spent their money, he always
had plenty left. Some of his funds he would lend, at various rates
I of interest, thus half-a-orown disembursed in the middle of term,
I had to be repaid, with the accrued interest of half-a-sovereign, at
I the end of the holidays. Some clever, but unscrupulous boys, also

found Gorgius convenient, for he promised to pay them money to
do his exercises for him. It is true that Goboius never kept his
word, and, as his system was detected, he was rather ignominiously
removed from school, quite as ignorant as when he first went thither.
When he became a Man, Goboius continued to aot on the same
system. Knowledge and olever people he despised; but he lent
money, and he bought up, for small sums, various patent Inventions
of Thomas Treadwell, and other ingenious characters. Some of
these proved successful and remunerative. Their originators died in
poverty, and in Lunatic Asylums; while Gorgius, having built a
twenty-storey Palace in Park Lane, having rented Moors and Forests
in Sootland, the country-house of a pauper Duke in England, possess-
ing, too, a fleet of Steam-yachts, luxuriously appointed, is now justly
regarded as one of the most illustrious of our Merchant Princes.
HINTS ON PAELIAMENTAEY DEPORTMENT.
{By Professor Turveydrop Toby, M.P.)
First get into Parliament. In the new order of things, that will
not be so difficult as formerly. Never was any need to be excep-
tionally olever; no need now to
be particularly rich. Parnellites
hope to settle this last difficulty
by securing weekly wages. Must
live, they say. No money, no
rows in Parliament. Different as
yet with Members for Great
Britain; but time may come.
No one can say what new Parlia-
ment may not do.
Necessary when you present
yourself before Constituency to
declare your politics. Safest
thing is to ascertain the politics
of majority of Electors and
enthusiastically adopt them. At
same time edge on the indepen-
dent line. Say you are for
Gladstone or Salisbury, as the
case may be, but that you are
the kind of man who would not
for any consideration vote for
what you did not at the bottom
of your heart feel would be for the benefit of the Empire at large
(Empire's a good word to bring in), and of the Constituency in par-
ticular. In the House of Commons, as will be shown in its proper
place, the role of the Independent Member, skilfully played, most
surely leads to fortune.
Other things being equal, don't choose a Constituency with a new-
fangled name. The Member for St. George's-in-the-East or the
Member for St. George's, Hanover Square, can never hope to make a
position in the House. Nor can the Member for the Strand, who
irresistibly suggests a 'busman. By preference come in for a Con-
stituency with one of the old familiar names. Members for these
will be no better and no worse than the rest, but they are sure to put
on airs, and to look down upon the Members for newly-named
Constituencies much as a Peer, whose Barony is a hundred years old,
looks down upon Mr. Gladstone's new creations.
When you are actually returned to Parliament yon must mind your
eye. You may do all kinds of things there, irregular, and even dis-
orderly; but take care how you do them. You must never, however
sudden and sharp may be the temptation, enter the House by making
a "cartwheel" up the floor. It is forbidden to smoke in the House,
and there is no accommodation in connection with the benches for
jugs and glasses. If you want to drink, you must get up and make a
speech, when you may drink whatever you can pay for. Rum punch
hot is discouraged on the ground of the odour it diffuses.
If you want to say anything disagreeable about a Member on either
side, you may do so without fear of consequences. There is no limit
to this privilege. If in any other Assembly you were, for example,
to accuse a gentleman of having wilfully brought about the hanging
of an innocent man, you would probably find yourself in an uncom-
fortable position. In the House of Commons you may do this, or
worse, without danger. The Speaker will interfere, will stigmatise
the words as unparliamentary, and will direot you to withdraw them.
Of course you withdraw at once, for the thing is done. You have
said the words, and there they are. The interposition of the Speaker
is even an additional advantage. It pointedly calls attention to the
insult. It brings about what is oafled "a scene," and a scene is
always reported verbatim in the newspapers. This privilege of safely
libelling people you don't like, whether in or out of the House, is, of
itself, worth all the trouble of getting into Parliament, and will
incite the intelligent Candidate to renewed exertions in canvassing.
Sufficient for the week are the hints thereof. When these are
digested, there may be a replenishment.

From following his vocation!
No cure the smallest good can do,
And prisons only rile 'em,
And it's a shame to send 'em to
A Lunatic Asylum.

And kill with much impunity;

To place such great reliance
On all who wave before their eyes

A NEW AUTOBIOGRAPHY.
The Real Original Wandering Jew, a relation of Eugene Sue's—
not Black-Eyed Sue's—who is still about, and likely to be, writes
from Paris to say that he thinks his Autobiography, published in
monthly parts, and continued through a few centuries, would be
highly interesting. It would, he f anoies, beat Irving's Annals of Our
Times into fits; and, as he was on speaking terms with everybody of
any note (he remembers poor Claudian perfectly, and considered him
a miserable rival and weak impostor), he could give some anecdotes
in his own raoy style, which would make the fortune of many a
diner-out. He asks us our advice as to a publisher, and as he looks
forward to getting rid of about twenty-five editions yearly, he
questions whether he shouldn't call it an Ought-to-Sell-ography,
instead of an Autobiography. We have answered his queries, and
place a specimen of his work before our readers:—
"It was in the year 10-19 that I had the pleasure of meeting Charles
the First. Went to see him at Whitehall, where he was staying at
the time (he died there shortly afterwards) furnished with a letter
of introduction from my dear old friend Oliver Cromwell. The
King was clad in a rather gaudy dressing-gown and a startling
smoking-oap. As I entered he was enjoying a large cigar. Taking
up a box of weeds from a side-table, he offered me one, saying that
1 although his father objected to tobacco and witches, he found the
former excellent.' I never saw him again, but was very intimate
with his sons. His eldest boy and namesake was a decidedly over-
rated person. Many of the ' good things' credited to him in reality
were spoken by nis brother, James the Second. However,
'Charles the Merry Monarch' (as he was called by his own set),
was not a' bad raconteur, and possessed some excellent port. A
connection of the family, William the Third, I met in after
years. All I can recollect about him was that he spoke Dutch with
fluency.
"I remember meeting William Shakspeare at a Moot given before
Queen Elizabeth at Gray's Inn. 'Betsy,' as we used to call her in
those days, was very fond of the Hon. Society, and invariably insisted
upon presiding at the Pensions and dining with the Benchers. On
this occasion she had dined too well, or the weather was sultry. At
all events, she had gone to sleep. The Benchers naturally aid not
like to disturb her, as she was known to have a 'nasty temper' when
crossed. I was laughing at the incident, when a fat middle-sized
man, with an uncommonly high forehead, came up to me, and saying
that he was William Shakspeare, asked me what he should do? It
appeared that he had been engaged to read A Midsummer-Night*
Dream, and that there was no one to listen to him. I may explain
that the Queen having gone to sleep, it was etiquette for everyone
to pretend to follow her example. William (or 'Billy,' as he
was called at the Globe Play-house), pointed out that the artful old
Treasurer for the year (one Bacon—a lawyer of some repute), was
sleeping with one eye open. I forget how the incident ended, as I
had to hurry away to keep another engagement.
"Two more friends I met about this time were, John Milton, the
Poet, and the First Duke of Marlborough, who won Blenheim, and
several other victories. Jack was blind, but genial. He acted as
Latin Secretary to 0liteb Cromwell (by the way, Cromwell.
although his father was a Brewer, came of a good old stock), and
used to swear at his employer in the dead languages. He has made
me roar again at the things he has said in Oliver's presence—the
latter, of course, not in the least knowing what sentiments his
amanuensis was uttering. I remember seeing some of the proof-
sheets of Paradise Regained, a poem not to be mentioned in the
some mouth with Paradise Lost. 'Handsome Jack Churchtxx,'
as the First Duke of Marlborough was called, although, no doubt,

Let us .shake our Wealth
an able commander, was extremely stupid in a drawing-room. He
was a very colourless individual. All lean remember about him is,
that he was particularly fond of chocolate.
"Talking of chocolate reminds me that another of my contempo-
raries—Julius Cesar—was very partial to oysters. It was this
craze that induced him to invade Britain, where "Whitstable natives
have been, from time immemorial, most excellent eating. Julius
was a thoroughly good fellow. He had but one fault—he was an
amateur author. I remember his sending me one day a pamphlet
upon the Gallic War. I just peeped into it—I won't say read it—it
was sad rubbish.
"2 propot of warriors reminds me that Edward thu Third and
Henry the Fifth had each some claim to the title. I knew them
both intimately. The latter's widow married a Welshman called
Owbn Tudor, who invented braces. For all that he was a dull dog
at his best.
'' The mention of braces reminds me I was lucky enough to be present
at the Battle of Hastings. The fight was excellent for trade; there
had been a very bad season that year—I think it was in 1066—and
William's victory brought a number of foreigners into the town.
On the night of the fight apartments were at a premium, not only in
Hastings but at St. Leonard's.
"I must bring my recollections for the" present to a conclusion by
one more anecdote. I was walking one day in Windsor Park, when
I heard the sound of horses' hoofs. I turned round, and a merry
voice asked me the time of day. I looked at my watch. I subse-
quently discovered that the person who had spoken to me was Herne
the Hunter."
We fancy that our Ancient Friend has been inspired by the great
popularity of a recent Autobiography, whioh has already reached
three editions, and whose merits were proclaimed by our "Paper-
knife Poem " Reviewist in these columns.

eeming," in accordance with a
recent leoturer on the Modern
Drama, that the acquisition of
wealth is the last thing that a
Manager of a Theatre or the
writer of a Play should consi-
der, it is possible that Messrs.
Augustus Harris and £. L.
Blanchard may cancel their
very successful Pantomime,
and substitute for it, in the
oause of the True, and conse-
quently the Beautiful, another,
of which the following may
serve as a rough scenario:—
RICHARD WHITTINGTON
"WITHOUT HIS CAT;
Or, the Superfluous Harlequin
and the Mythical Lord
Mayor of London.
Scene I. — The Cave of
Shams. The Demon Bill
Sticker, attended by his Advertising Imps. Sooial Science Lecture,
and Ultra JEsthetical Pamphlet, discuss at much length the claims
of various subjects for a Pantomime. They think something
"earnest" may be done with Richard Whtttington if everything
popular in the story is out out. Comparatively sudden appearance of
the Fairy Jones, who, by a wave of his wand, changes the Leoture
into-^Sc«NE II.—Trysting-Place of the Exclusive Votaries of the
Loftiest Nonsense. Grand Ballet introducing the long-established
Mutual Admiration Danoe, in which some hundreds of Old Women
(candidates for election to the Playgoers' Club) will take part. Pat
teul by a joint Author (as Mr. Jones would rather die than say) meet
to the occasion. Joint—meet, feeble suggestion of a pun likely to be
provocative of mirth amongst the more-easily-tickled. Henee refer-
ence to joint—meet to be avoided as demonstrating lack of earnestness.
Scenes III., IV., V., VI., and VII. dealing with the story of
Richard Whtttington, and proving in the most prosaio and least
exciting manner that "there never was no suoh person." This theory
to be set forth in a funereal manner as loftily regardless of the popu-
larity that seoures wealth as of the dangers and deficits of boredom.
Cutting out of comic monarchs, wonderful animals, glittering proces-
sions, beautiful scenery, and everything else calculated to extort
admiration from the thoughtless, and leading up to—
Scene VIII.—The Dreary Marsh of Misty Bosh. The principal
characters are seen groping about in despair trying to understand what
it all means, until enlightened by the appearanoe of the Fairy Jones,
who by a flourish of his magio leoturer s wand changes the dismal
tableau into
The Grand Transformation Scene, showing the gradual eclipse of
the Popular Pantomime by the Spirit of Riotous Rot. The Son of
the National Theatre rapidly sinks, giving plaoe to an Extensive
View of Empty Benches. Triumph of the True, the Beautiful, the
Earnest, in a word, of Hi Falutin Bosh.
Final Tableau.—Premature Collapse of the Pantomime andSudden
Requisition for a good rough-and-tumble, thoroughly stagy, old-
fashioned melodrama of the Silver King type for immediate produc-
tion long before Easter!
A remarkable event has lately happened. An Author has pub-
lished a Tragedy,—not for acting, but for perusal. The Author is
Mr. Merivale, and the title of the work is Florien. The plot is
based on the old story of Oeorge Barnwell. Many of the Scenes are
powerfully dramatic, and only a few alterations would be requisite
for effective representation, though only a very executions! Actress
could play the part of Flerien. The weakness, and the woes of the
sufferers excite our compassion but eannot enlist our sympathy, any
more than can the three principals in Buy Blat. The plot of
Mr. Mertvale's tragedy makes it as readable as a good Novel: while,
as dramatic poetry, taking the Play as a whole, and not dwelling on
a few palpable detects, it will, to quota 'Arbt, give the Author of
Becket and Queen Mary " what for," and make poetio dramatists
"sit up a bit."
A friend tells us that Jack and the Beanstalk at the Crystal Palace
is a mixture of old and new—the old being good and the new better.
Amongst the former must be classed, certain scenery and properties
suggestive of bygone glories at Drury Lane, and belonging to the
latter are the very best stage-giants on reoord. They seem oer-
tainly to be people of few words, and yet can hardly be described
as short. Altogether the Directors, Mr. Augustus Harris, and the
Publio generally are to be congratulated on the Pantomime at the
Crystal Palace.
The same friend has seen Saints and Sinners at the Vaudeville,
and Ttcins. He was much shocked at the " gags" of Mr. Righton
in the part of the Professional Infant which he describes as not being
in the best possible taste. For instance the Twin who wears the
gaiters and general get-up of a Bishop asks his host to include in the
library reserved for him in his private room a French novel, and
uses very strong and unecclesiastical expressions. If Mr. Derrick
the Author is satisfied, I have got nothing to say; it is Mr. Righ-
ton's business, and the Author's, not mine. As for Saints and
Sinners our friend seems unable to decide in which category the
Author himself should be included. He says that he believes
Mr. Jones, to judge from some of the dialogue, has every wish to be
added to the Saints, but then, considering the quality and quantity
of three Aots out of the five, he must be put down sorrowfully as a
Sinner. However, Mr. Thomas Thorn e is pleased, and so, what's
the odds as long as the Manager of the Vaudeville is happy r
Babes, at Toole's, which was originally a burlesque per-version of
The Babes in the Wood, is now little more than an American Variety
Show, a hotch-potch into which any eccentricities are chucked at
haphazard and served up to the public. All a matter of taste, of
course, and it exactly suits—those who like it.
We do not credit our Artist's report that Comic Scenes are to
brighten the finish of Borneo and Juliet, though the play as pre-
sented is full of more or less remarkable Transformation Scenes.
Friar Laurence will be a rather too sturdy Pantaloon, Peter an
excellent Clown, Mr. Terriss the Harlequin, and Miss Merry
Andrewson will be, of course, the Columbine. The Sprites who
assist in the transformation are the Carpenters.

THE CROAK OF THE CAPITALIST.
I heard a man of money, which he wanted to invest,
A melancholy mitlionnaire, unload his anxious breast.
Meanwhile he scanned and scrutinised a list of shares and stocks;
The banks and mines and shipping lines, the railways and the docks.

Middle-man Weasel Sucking the Life out of the Fbeb Trade
Hake.
THE BAR AS A PROFESSION.
Sib,—You may have noticed that within the last few days there
has been much discussion in the Newspapers about the prospects of
the " Gentlemen of the Long Robe." A Correspondent who seems to
have ample leisure for letter-writing, addresses your leading contem-
porary, and declares that he, as one of the Juniors, can get no work
to do. He insists that, with the exception of a few brilliant examples,
Barristers starve, and suggests that the two branches of the Profession
should be amalgamated. So far, the reading of briefs and the serving
of writs have been kept as two distinct employments, and I see no
reason for a change. As to the Bar not paying its more humble
members, I join issue. 1 believe, with proper management, every
wig-wearer would do well. I jot down a few facts and figures.
My first question shall be—Can a Barritter pay his Expenses
during his First Year ?—Unless very unfortunate, certainly. Of
course, when he commences praotice, the newly-called Counsel will
have a number of expenses to meet that will not again occur. As
nothing succeeds like success, a Barrister, during his first year,
should do his best to prove to his Clients, the Solicitors, that he is
prosperous. However, ostentation of any sort should be studiously
avoided in favour of comfort. The following is a list of legitimate
expenses that may be conscientiously incurred by a Junior anxious
to advance in his profession:—
Rent of Chambers in Lincoln's Inn or one of the
Temples _ ...
Furnishing the same with appropriate Furniture
Fee to Designer of Dados, Frieze, and Wall-paper
with legal curiosities (snuff-box
of
Filling Museum
Judge Jeffries, &c, &o.)
Salary to Clerk
Ditto Laundress
Legal Library (after deducting 25 per cent, for
Discount)
Expenses on Circuit
Fee-Book
Brief-paper, &c, actually used

It is possible that the
in the Law Library is ni
r be a little more. For instance,
the Comic Blackttone. This
indispensable work of reference has been purposely omitted, as a new
edition is shortly to be published, and consequently a saving may
be effected by the economical Barrister waiting for the fresh issue.
Say that the young Practitioner receives an unexpected legacy of
£11,000 from a long-lost uncle (and really he will have very bad
'".ek if he doesn't), and receipts and expenditure will balance thus:—
£ «. d.
Legaoy (received) 11,000 0 0
Expenses (as above) 10,978 0 0
Profit 22 0 0
This is not so bad for a first year, and ought to be an incentive to
further efforts in the same direction.
My second question shall be—Is the Bar a Lucrative Profession f
—Very lucrative. Of course a man, if he wishes to succeed, must
lay himself out for business. The usual mode of obtaining briefs is
by marrying the daughter of a Solicitor. This is a good old-fashioned
plan, but, like many other ancient mstoms, it is'eapablc of-improve-
ment. Instead of marrying one daughter of one Solioitor, a really
ambitious Counsel should marry several daughters of several
Solicitors. The fathers-in-law, although possibly annoyed at first,
would ultimately forego the pleasure of an action for bigamy, to
avoid scandal in their families, and the clients of the Barrister would
consequently increase. Another mode of making an income is to take
pupils (called in the profession "pups "), and setting them to do the
drudgery of your chambers in exchange for a handsome premium.
Yet a third way (and, in some instances, perhaps the best) is, to
get called to the Bar, and—work at something else.
Your obedient Servant, Briefless, Junior.

THE (NON-) "PERFORMING DOGS."
Professor G. soliloquises after the Performance.
On, confound those two dogs! A more talented troupe
Even rivals admit were not easy to find;
At ball and at barrel, at ladder and hoop,
They 're not easy to beat—when the brutes have a mind.
More talent is not to be found on four feet,
Though perhaps their ensemble's not always complete.
There's Hasty so steady, a fugleman grand!
There's Bill, with suoh dignity, ah I and such go I
There's Chabxie, so quick and so sweetly in hand!
Hugh, neat at a " balance," though just a bit slow I
Then Joe, clever Joe, at all tricks such a trump,
Good—almost too good—at a climb or a jump!
Such a troupe ought to be the most splendid success;
And yet our performances lately go wrong.
Things seem to get into no end of a mess,
Though Joe is so clever and Bill is so strong.
And it's all, I'm persuaded, along of you two.
Pat! This sort of thing, I assure you, won't do!
You'd spoil any troupe with your lumbering style;
No neatness, no finish,—all stagger and fall.
You can't expect " hands " from the audience while
One does the trick badly, and one not at all.
And we cannot expect the performance to " go"
When two chief performers are awkward and slow.
Awkward! Why Gran you went staggering there
As though you were raw at the balancing game;
And Darby, to squat half asleep on your chair
Appears your chief joy and peculiar aim.
Humph! Is it perchance that at barrel and hoop
I've imperfeotly trained these two stars of my troupe t
I fancy that's what they are saying in front,
Their catcalls I fear were directed at me.
In fact their expressions of blame were most blunt,
"You call yerself Trainer? Yah I Fiddlededee!"
Such cries which my ears pretty loudly assault
Can only mean one thing,—they hold me in fault.
I'm responsible anyhow, 'tisn't much use
To blame this dog or that, since I manage the lot.
Though Granny should blunder or Darby refuse,
'Tis the trainer who's hissed, and I'm getting it hot.
I must thin out my troupe, keep 'em tighter in tether,
Or else the performance chuck up altogether.

Chester, the Sheriff and Becorder, the Aldermen and Town Councillors and
officials of the Corporation, headed by a Volunteer band, and escorted by the

THE CHILDREN'S BALL AT THE MANSION
HOUSE.
Ah, what a wunderfool World is this as we all lives in! We alius
seems to think as we've got to the hend of everythink, when, low
we finds as we 're ony j ust cum to the beginning. Wen we 're a going
for to stop I'm sure I don't know; and if we ain't never a going for
to stop, I wunders where we shall 'git to at last! But a trewse to
to this ere moral lysing, and let me oum to stern fax. I suttenly did
think, wen I offishiated at the last Fancy Children's Dress Ball at the
Mansion House, as we had quite got to the werry Haemy of perfec-
Bhun in this most butifool of all lovely sites; but I'm bound in
honner to say as I was rong. Why the site of all them hundreds of
bootiful hinnocents, dressed in the most lovelyest of their best close,
all a setting on the floor in art' circles, a listening to the story of
Mr. Punch and his rongs, and how he tryumfed over his fose, was
sitch a site as acshally brort tears to my old eyes. And how keenly
the littel Boys seemed to relish the lesson of respec for the magesty
of the Lor, that Mr. Punch teaches bo strikingly. There was one
brite-looking little chap, a Sailor in H.M.S. Wictory, who larfed so
artily wenever Mr. Punch nocked sumbody down, that I'm amost
afeard it will make him just a leetle rebellyous wen he gos back to
his dixity, and has to man the main top, or to splice his main braces,
or to shiver his timbers.
I was about to say, when the thorts of Mr. Punch's egsampel
dragged off my atenshun, that the dresses wur suttenly that warious
and that charming, as I ain't never seed, not even in Mr. Arris's
Pantomime—of who, more annon. It's of coarse diffycult to make a
slection were all is so lovely, but I suttenly thinks as the Parm tree
of all must be given, if there appens to be one in the ouse, to what
1 may call the Royal Party. Suttenly a more gentlemanly Baby
Bunting, in his nice warm wite Rabit Skins, was never seed; and
Sherryf Fillips's quortet, as Brown called 'em, merely becoz there
was four on 'em, just like Brown's rubbish, inkluding a lovely Mrs.
Robinson Krcso, and a Eanary Bird, as was really a great improve
ment on Natur, was simply perfeot. What a prowd and appy
Sherryf he looked, and so did his good, kind-looking Sherryfess.
I wasn't at all aware how werry yung, Barrysters begin their
jawious perfesshun. Sum on 'em I shood think coud ardly ha' bin of
seven years standing.
Praps if I was asked to say conseenshusly, I thinks they calls it,
who looked the werry appiest of the hole lot, not to speak it prof ainly,
I shood at wunce shout out, "the Last Maress f" ony I nose my
place too well to take sitch a libberty, and well Bhe might, when she
saw the brillyant sucksess of all her trubble and anksiety. And I
spose as ewen them as moves in the werry ighest spears of sosierty,
don't altogether escape. Wunderfool must he the constitushuns of

looking Deputy say, a good stiff glass of brandy-and-water wood
suit me better. But no, no, there's a time for all things, Mr.
Deputty, and hot brandy-and-water ain't quite "comifo" at a
Children's Ball, and so he didn't git none, and went away growling.
How we pore Waiters has to work I Wood any one think arfter
my harduous labours among the children, I shood have had to rush
off to Drewry Lane Theater to resoom my dooties among about two
hundred of the most bootifnlest and most oharmingest Actresses as
praps the World ever saw! But so it was, and this was how it was.
Everybody as is anybody has of course herd what a wunderful
Manager Mr. Arriss is, but praps they don't know what a grand
feenancier he is. Sumbody left £3 a-year for a supper at Drewry
Lane on Twelf Night; and this wunderful Manager nas managed it
so well, that he can give with it a grand supper to some hundreds of
Actors and Actresses and their paytrons! Has he had invited lots of
Aldermen and Deputys and Common Councilman, of course he thort
he had better have me, as being well used to 'em. So accordingly I
got there about 12, jest in time to see 'em clear the stage and then
help to lay the various cloths. Of course I thort that as it was on a
stage, the supper wood be all gammon, and the Champain all non-
intoxyoucarnts, but on the contrary, it was all reel and all fust-rate.
How the numerus gestes who had jest bin a supping at the
Manshun House coud set to work again at Drury Lane with renewd
appytights was somewot of a staggerer; but great is the power of
Corporations in gineral, as well as of the City Corporation in par-
ticular. And now occurd an ewent in my umbel life for witch I
was not at all prepared; for the great Manager hisself, seeing me
standing inrapshured at the gay seen, acshally said to me, "Have
you tasted the Badley Cake, Mr. Robert?" To which I of course
replied, "No, Sir."
"Then come with me, and I will cut you a slice, as everybody is
expected to taste it."
And he did it. And I ate it. And that little act of courtesy of
the great Manager to me, ony a pore Waiter, sent me home to my
wirtuous Couch, about three in the morning, a gratified and grate-
ful man. Robert.

BY UNDERGROUND!
{Quite a new sort of Ballade—Our Own
Invention.)
By Underground one day I went:
In crowds the startled neighbours ran,
For they had heard of my intent,
And deemed me an intrepid man!
Admiringly my face they scan,
For scarcely anyone is found
To travel—suoh my daring plan—
By Underground!
By Underground, though, I was bent
To risk once more my little span,
I took a lamp that someone lent,
Some sal volatile, a fan,
A stick, of potted shrimps a can,
A brandy-flask, of weeds a pound,
A pistol,—then my course began
By Underground I
By Underground three hours we spent
Between two stations; limp and wan
Were we, when, lo! the air was rent
By dynamite; the Irish clan
Had wrecked the Metropolitan!
So forth into the dark I bound:
I'm taken for a Fenian
By Underground!

Beak, to thy court, with oath and ban,
They dragged me; guiltless was I found;
But never more I '11 lead the van

tion of the smallest number.
PUBLIC GRIEVANCES.
{Introductory.)
Having been commissioned by Mr. Punch, the bold and inde-
pendent Friend of Mankind, to make a fearless and searching
inquiry into the many grievances under which the patient Publio
suffer, with a view to their exposure, and subsequent remedy, I
have to request of all sorts and conditions of men—ay, and of
women too—inhabiting this huge Metropolis, to furnish me with
particulars, founded on their own personal experience, of any special
grievance, of a public character, that appears to them peculiarly
grievous, and to admit of a simple remedy. It should be thoroughly
understood that this is not for the purpose of satisfying a mere idle
curiosity, but from a far higher, and purer, and loftier motive. As
further concealment is no longer necessary, the announcement may
as well be made at once, that Her Majesty's Government, yielding
partially to the unanswerable appeal made to them in Mr. Punch's
columns a few weeks ago, have decided to give the City three seats
instead of two, as proposed in their Bill, but on the one distinct and
irrevocable understanding that Mr. Punch shall be elected to that
seat by the unanimous vote of the whole constituency. This con-
dition, I need scarcely say, has been accepted by the City Fathers
with rapture, as it brings within measurable distance the longed-for
day, when the same great Benefaetor of his Species will at length
assume the position for which he is in every respect so specially
qualified, and be greeted by his delighted Brother Citizens as the
Right Honourable Mr. Punch, M.P., Lord Mayor of the City of
London!
The enormous sacrifice this will entail upon his Lordship can be
better conceived than described, but he has an object in view, the
accomplishment of which he feels will place him far above either
Whittington or Gresham in the future history of the Great City.
This object is, to collect together, through my humble instru-
mentality, a list of the various Publio Grievances under which the
inhabitants of the Metropolis have so long groaned, to decide out of
his own inner consciousness the best means for entirely remedying
them, to embody the whole mighty plan in one single Bill, each
particular clause remedying one particular grievance, to run it
through both Houses of Parliament with the same startling rapidity
with which the addition to the iniquitous Inoome Tax was carried,
and then to retire to his luxurious home, there to repose on the fresh
laurels he will have deserved as well as gained, always supposing
that laurels are a convenient conch upon which to repose. If aggrieved
persons will therefore state their cases, and forward them to my
Office they will receive due attention from,
Mr. Punch's own Inspector.
General Grievance Office, January 1, 1885.
No. L—Rates.
"There be Land Rates and Water Rates."—Shakspeabe {adapted).
The Aggrieved Representative states his case in this wise :—
I am a Trader in the City of London carrying on my comparatively
small business with ever-increasing anxiety, arising in great measure
from the unfair competition of the various "Stores, and of the
gigantic establishments that have sprung up of late. I endeavour
to meet this by increased industry and diminished relaxation. I can
trnly say I arise early and late take rest, and eat the bread of care-
fulness. My rent is nigh, but it is a fixed payment, and for it I get
the use of a fairly comfortable house. But the rates are insatiable
and incomprehensible. First come the quarterly rates for the relief
of the Poor, and strange to say, although the number of the Poor in
the City has been rapidly decreasing for years past, the rate"
the same. Puzzle Number 1.
Then oomes the Metropolitan Board of Works Rate, which I am
informed by the Bmiling Collector—who naturally approves of high
rates, as he is paid by Commission—is for the expense incurred by
that unknown Body, not one of whom I ever saw, or heard of, or had
the opportunity of voting for or against—in pouring the collected
sewage of the Metropolis, into what used to be our beautiful river,
by which expensive proceeding they have changed it into a poisonous
lng Sewer, and for which infamous proceeding I am

Puzzle Number 2.
Then comes what is humorously called the Consolidated
which, one would naturally expect, meant a Rate that consol
within itself all the Rates of the City; but, so far from that being
the case, it is only one out of some half-dozen of these expensive
puzzles. This Rate. I am informed by the same cheerful official, is
dedicated exclusively to the various matters conneoted with the
streets of the City, and is imposed by a number of persons called by
the dignified, but not over-savoury title of Commissioners of Sewers;
but who elect them, or have any control over them or

expenditure, I know not; all I know is, that I have none. I also
gather, from what I occasionally read, that these gentlemen have
incurred a debt of about a million and a half of money, for the pay-
ment of which I, with the other Citizens of London, am responsible,
though I have never had the opportunity afforded me of either
giving or withholding my consent to the expenditure of one single
shilling of this enormous amount. Puzzle Number 3.
I will next take what is mysteriously called .the Trophy Tax. Why
this particular Tax is distinguished by so warlike a name, I have
never been able to discover, or to what purpose it is applied, or by
whom. Why should we be taxed for Trophies P and where are they
to be seen? The hint that the Fund was possibly applied to pay for
the gorgeous Uniforms of the City's Deputy Lieutenants, of course I
reject with contempt. But that there should exist at the present
day a Tax, the object of which no fellow can explain, I think I may
fairly put down as Puzzle Number 4.
I pass over the Police Rate, the School Board Rate, the Sewers
Rate, the Ward Rate, the Water Rate, and the Tithe Rate, with the
general remark that seldom a month passes, from January to
December, that I do not receive a demand for Rates in the making
or in the spending of which I have no voice, but which I am im-
peratively called upon to pay on pain of a summons before a City
Alderman, which 1 think I may reasonably designate as Puzzle
Number 5. A Puzzled Ratepayer.
Such, Sir, is the plain unvarnished tale of one who is ironically
called a " Freeman of London," and who is a fair and honest represen-
tative of a very numerous class of hardworking, honest, and loyal
men, and if you, Sir, could condescend from your high estate, and,
like some of your contemporaries, offer a reward for the solution of a
Puzzle, I would venture to suggest as a subject, How is the above
statement of your neighbour, consistent with the great Constitutional
maxim that no one shall be taxed without his own consent, or with
that of his properly constituted representative P And it is my candid
conviction, Sir, that however prinoely the amount offered, it would
never be successfully olaimed.

gravely to assert that Englishmen were little susceptible to the sub-
tler shades of lyrical expression, because of their habitual meat
diet." If that is so, the old saying, "No song, no supper," should
be changed to, "Too much supper, no song." But here is a chance
for the Vegetarians! There are not, perhaps, many "subtle
shades" in "Oh, the Roast Beef of Old England r' But what a lyrical
masterpiece might be produced if one of Mr. Newman's lentil-lov-
ing disciples were to let himself have full swing on suoh an inspir-
ing theme as, "OA, the Boiled Beans of New England!" The
suggestion is thrown out freely, and Mr. Punch hopes for fruits from
the lovers of vegetables. Vegetarian organs, please oopy.

On the reign and the race of the Queen of our Isles.

Henceforth in his heart, which the years have left green,
To the Son of his Prince, and Grandson of his Queen!
SO VERY CLEAR!
OR, WANTED A HAND-BOOK.
(Politioal Economists discussing subject of the hour over their wine.)
Fi^rst Political Economist {after having been holding forth vaguely,
but with some decision, on the subject of Capital ana Labour). Yes,
you may depend upon it, old Bismarck's right, and that the increase
of Emigration is an irrefragable evidence of the rising prosperity of a
nation. Soon as a man has made money enough to .do it, he leaves
his country, and goes off somewhere else.
Second P. E. Ah, yes, I see. But, if he is so prosperous at home
{reflectively), why should he want to be off elsewhere r
Third P. E. Just so. That's what I was thinking. But I
suppose it's the result of supply and demand. It's astonishing how
little people know about these plain questions. {Recalling indistinctly
fragments of a Magazine article.) Take the present depression
of trade, for instance. People will tell you it's because there's no
demand; but any man who studies the question five minutes can see
at a glance the real mischief is over-production.
First P. E. Not a bit of it. That's th9 usual blunder on the
subject. For the matter of that, what do you mean by "over-pro-
duotion f" I don't suppose you could define it for the life of you.
Second P. E. Oh 1 I think I understand that. Say, I represent
demand, and you represent supply, and B. is the market, and I go to
B. for one pair of boots, when you have just sold him five thousand.
B.'s surplus stock, which he has now on his hands, is the result of
over-production, and, I suppose, a dead loss.
First P. E. {brightly). Nothing of the kind. Simple enough.
All B. now requires is a Protective Tariff. He is hampered for the
moment by foreign competition. The boots he is offering at fifteen-
and-six pence a pair can, let us say, be produced in1 Pennsylvania,
shipped across the Atlantic, and sold at a good profit in this country
at five-and-ninepenee. What's to be done then * Why, the Govern-
ment claps on a twelve-shilling duty, and it's as clear as A B C that
the matter rights itself. B.'s now is the cheapest market. You and
four thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine other people., in want
of boots go to B., a,.d he gets rid of his surplus stock.
Second P. E. Yes—ahem! it's quite plain, of course. But why
should I, for instance, and the four thousand nine hundred and
ninety-nine other people purchase our boots for fifteen-and-sixpence
a pair, when, but for the Protective Tariff .we could have got the very
same article for five-and-ninepenee? Why, in fact, should we
virtually throw our money away?
Third P. E. No—no; that's where you 're wrong. You don't
really throw your money away. It remains in the country. (Trying
to recall the wrong end of something he has read in an abridged
edition of "Adams Wealth of Nations.") I can't exactly explain to
you how it is—but I know that you don't really, in the long run,
throw your money away. (With confidence.) It looks as if you did
—but you don't.
First P. E. Oh, yes: I've read it all up, you know, and he's
quite right. You see it's the trade makes the prosperity of the
country. If there's no trade, there's no prosperity, and if there's no
prosperity—well, where are you?
Third P. E. Just so. Where are you?
Second P. E. {still unconvinced). Yes, I know—but still I would
rather pay five-and-ninepence for my boots—and spend the balance
on something else, you know.
First P. E. Hopeless fallacy! if every one was like you, why,
there would soon be no bootmakers at all.
Third P. E. Yes, it's just that sort of unsound theorising—that
is ruining British Commerce. Take the Agricultural Interest for
instance. Why I suppose you and those like you would stamp out
the British farmer next P
First P. E. {savagely). Ha! I '11 be bound you would.
Third P. E. Well—if you put it to me—if it ever comes to my
paying fifteen shillings and sixpence, or even fifteen-penoe-half-
penny for a quartern loaf, all I can say is—the prosperity of the
country—and, for the matter of that—the British farmer too—be
hanged! [ Tableau.
STABLE PHILOSOPHY?
Mb. William Morris, poet, paper-decorator, and philosopher—the
"Votes" of Socialism, so his interviewer, with a nappy mingling
vagueness, styles him—has been holding forth at some length for the
benefit of an enterprising daily paper on the subject of his projected,
but at present rather distant, earthly Paradise. In this social Eden
it seems that " a squad of Dukes" {sic) will not, as might reasonably
have been expected, be called upon to take their five hours' turn
(shirt-sleeves tucked up) with a set of brawny-armed navvies on a
railway cutting, but they will simply be effaced, and disappear.
Even Mr. William Morris will be a plain "oitizen," and drop the
complimentary Esquire from his envelopes, and say nothing on his
visiting cards, so it is to be presumed, about his being a genuine Votes.
The "Revolution" which is to bring about this perfectly beatific
state of things is, however, not to be accomplished without force, and
in preparation for it Mr. William Morris is already working with
indefatigable might. It appears that:—
"His lecture-hall at home—3, Upper Mall, Hammersmith, a quiet, half-
rustic spot, within a few yards of the placid, turbid Thames—is an old
stable, which he has comfortably fitted
up, and completely transformed for its
novel purpose."
SYMPHONY IN BLACK.

As far as his work is concerned,
therefore, the great apostle may-
be said to be fairly installed. All
he evidently wants is his ohance.
It is pleasing to know that, while
in the new condition of things,
thus rapidly being hastened on at
Hammersmith, "BarbaricRaces"
are " to be let alone," the real
elevation of the working-classes
will be brought about by the abo-
lition of the maintenance of pri-
vate property in land, capital, and
machinery. This is all very beau-
tiful, and we shall look out for
the next prophetic utterance of
the Hammersmith Votes with
kindly and encouraging interest.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MAHDI AND HIS LETTER.
TffE False Prophet was seated in his tent with his Grand Vizier,
initiating a friendly Sheikh, by name El Jcggins, into the mysteries
of the old Soudanese national sport, Teb-spoof. The Monaroh and
his Vizier had succeeded in claiming the handsome sword, pistols,
yataghan, and jewelled turban worn by El .1 [coins, when a dis-
turbance without caused the Mahdi to hurl down the sheet of paper
on which he was engaged, and shout, " Allah Bismillah, are the infidel
sons of dogs upon us already, Sellm?"
Skt.i m entered, and making a low obeisanoe to his master, said,
'May it please the Ruler of the Earth, there has just arrived a
creature, who is proud to be called his slave, with important despatches
stolen from the English."
"It is well." answered the Mahdi. "Let the beast be brought
in, and send for my English Interpreter."
Then there entered a grave and learned man, followed by a half-
starved, half-clothed wretch, who, from the folds of his soanty linen
clothing, produced a crumpled sheet of note-paper. The Mahdi,
through his Vizier, took this letter, and after a gallant but ineffectual
attempt to read it upside down, handed it to his Interpreter, and
bade him translate.
In a Blow and solemn voice the Interpreter began: —
"Dear old Chappie."
"Tell the Minister of War to search the Dictionary of English
Soldiers and find out who Dearoldchappie is."
The Minister of War studied the Army List, and oonfessed his
inability to find any officer of that name.
"Take the Minister of War outside," yelled the justly irate
Monarch, "and give him one hundred of the bastinado on the soles
of his feet."
To the accompaniment of the Minister's piteous shrieks for mercy
the Interpreter continued :—
"Christmas is over and gone in every sense, for we have all been
half-seat over, and all our money it gone."
That means," explained the Monarch, "that England has sent
another fleet which is half-way across the ooean, and that she has
spent her last piastre in its equipment."
"Allah, but the Ruler of the Desert is like unto the unclean swine
which can see the wind," murmured the Foreign Minister, in tones
of admiration so genuine, that his master immediately slipped a few
drops of poison into his sherbet, while the Interpreter continued:—
We have painted the time red, and no mittake."
"A religious ceremony of these infidel dogs," explained the
Mahdi, at which the Minister of Religion, not knowing he was
observed, winked with both eyes, and was forcibly removed to be
hung. The Interpreter went on:—
"Now that I have tummoned enough pluck to tend you a line, old
boy, I don't teem to have any newt. It being four in the morning,
and my not having been to bed for five nightt, may, however, account
{for this."
"Marvellous workers, these white dogs," interrupted the Mahdi.
"Everybody it in the country, or broke in town. Dicky lost three
thou the other night at Sac."
The Mahdi nodded, as if he understood it. The Vizier nodded
too, but he was asleep. When he had been set on fire, and
i thoroughly awakened, the reader continued:—
"And I had such a ghastly Boxing Day at Kempton Park, that
I seriously think of emigration."
"Minister of Education, tell me where Kempton Park is."
"I have not the remotest idea," promptly replied the truthful
Minister.
"Take the Minister of Education out—but so far, that I shall not
be disturbed by his interruptions, and give him seventy dozen with
the best khourbash," was the unanswerable repartee of the Mahdi.
Then turning suddenly towards the Foreign Minister, who seemed
to be taken with violent convulsions, he inquired in an irritable
tone,—
"What is the Foreign Minister tying himself into knots for?"
"May it please your Serene Highness, he says he thinks he is
dying.''
i "Ah, true. I had forgotten that poison. Well, take him out-
I nde. I am not going to have him dying all over my tent. Out
with him J Proceed I7'
Nothing theatrical new. I haven't seen any Pantomimes, as I
Mflfl hare to do them when my sister's children come to town.
Terry's back at the Gaiety; but Bessie Bellwood is grander than
ner at the Royal with her song of 'What cheer, 'Ria We only
m«i that old fool the Mahdi"
'Read that again!" shrieked the Mahdi.
JJ That old fool the Mahdi"
Take this dagger, which is poisoned, and stick it hard in your-
"But it will hurt," objected the Interpreter.
I mean it to. Now, do as you are bid."
The Interpreter did so,1 and, after a low bow, retired outside, not
without many spasmodio twitchings of his limbs, and lay on the
sand, where his last groans were as the baying of dogs at the
inoffensive moon.
"Allah, but he made'sweet musio," said the Mahdi. "Now, dog,
when did you get this epistle P"
"Oh, most noble one, I stole it from a fair young man."
'' What general was he t"
"Guards' Camel Corps."
"So be it. As a reward for your industry, courage, and integrity,
my guards will now take you outside and—let me see—yes—burn
you!"
Then the Mahdi lit his long pipe, and working out the various
problems which he had been listening to, in his brain, fell into a
sound and prolonged slumber, and the next day the readers of the
London Daily Papers read—
THE SOUDAN.
(From Our Special Correspondent.)
The Mahdi is perfectly informed as to the exact state of European
Politics. It is certain that he derives his knowledge from stolen and
intercepted letters.
DREAMY DELIGHT!
"Professor Stuart concluded with an earnest denunciation of War, the
dreamy delight of the Conservative class. He also argued at length in favour
of the extension of the suffrage to Women."
Let us cease to give money for navies and guns,
For torpedoes, and swords, and the like,
For the Man of the Future's the fellow who runs
If the enemy threatens to strike!
Should a foeman appear on your borders, invite
Him to enter, and give him a pass;
But resist him not! War is the dreamy delight
Of the pampered Conservative class!
There's Russia wants India. Well, give her her way,—
What is India to you or to me P
And there's Germany gTeedy for Holland, they say,
And extending her empire by sea;
And there's France, that is spoiling, they guess, for a fight,
And our gains she would gladly amass.
Let us bear it,—for War is the dreamy delight
Of the pampered Conservative class!
When our Empire is gone, when our Trade is as dead
As proverbial nails in a door,
When the Working-man has not a mouthful of bread,
And when Capital's fled from the shore,
When there is not one Landlord to plunder by might
(Which is right), for they 've run in a mass;
We '11 at least nave got rid of the dreamy delight
Of the pampered Conservative claBs!
When the Dockyards are idle, the Foundries are cold,
When our Commerce is driven from the sea,
When the cottons of Manchester cannot be sold,
What a triumph, Professor, for thee!
When the cheek of an Englishman's ashen and white
If a foreigner happens to pass,
Let's rejoice, for we've shunted the dreamy delight
Of the pampered Conservative class!
But, alas, if to Ladies the Suffrage you give,
And permit them the use of the vote,
Then the " dreamy delight" will be certain to live.
And the epaulettes, ay, and the coat;
And the flag you detest like a meteor bright
It will wave, when you 're under the grass:
For the Soldier and Sailor are still the delight
Of the Fair,—a Conservative class!
Mb. W. Holland was very much annoyed on overhearing. one of
the audience telling a child who found it a bit dull, "Wait till the
Clowns roll by, Jiinir."^ The People's Skaterer (so called from his
idea of starting a huge rink) remonstrated, and informed the young
man that there was nothing "jinny" about even a show of Hol-
land's, and that the eighteen acrobatic jesters were all temperance
men, only rather bigger than ordinary empty tumblers.

the last two or three years, and which rule as steadily as ever—such, for example, as a

THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT
In connection with the little incident in' the of
O'Donovan Rossa, the Times says.:—
"Short was introduced to M'Dermott as 1 Mr. Loxo,' and,
afterwards, when Dbasy was arrested at Liverpool, the police
searched in Cork for Lo.no, the description of him corresponding
exactly with Shobt."
If this be true, it goes a long way towards accounting
for the failure of the police in bringing the dynamitards
to justice. If, when they have a warrant to arrest
Shout, they deliberately set themselves to look for
Long, it can scarcely be wondered at that these mis-
creants work with impunity. '' How Long ? how Long?"
as an eminent tragedian used nightly to observe
work should be made of such a system.
MORE HONOURS FOR ALFRED.
'Tis vain! In such a brassy time
To ask me to write verses,
Though Publishers should tempt my rhyme,
With magic more than Circe s.
I '11 move the Pawns, if not the Pen,
In very desperation;
For now I am the Chairman of
The Chess Association!
But what is this I hear—the whine
That I am still the Laureate?
Heavens! with rivals such as mine
That's not a thing to glory at.
Morris is mute, and Swinburne's last
Not ranch his fame enhances,
While Browning's "genius," sure, has passed
Among FerishtaKs Fancies.
Get out the Board of Black and White,
That charms my learned leisure!
Where "all is square," it must be right
For me to find my pleasure.
Those Kingly Idylls once I wrote,
But now I fear 'tis fated,
If I don't idle with the King
My life would be stale-mated.
So I shall rule for months and years
The noble Chess Society;
I '11 dub my Knights Sir Sediveres,
Or Modreds, for variety;
And when I move my Queen about.
If Pawns should dare to check it,

Dear Sib,
Mt name will be familiar to you as that of the
performer of the Second Murderer at the time when the
late Mr. Macready was proprietor of Drury Lane
Theatre. Since then I have not set foot on the London
Boards. Will you kindly help a brother Artist by insert'
ing the following little notice, which I have writti
myself, in the next number of Punch't

"Mr. Patrick O'Rodge, the well-known and famous
tragedian, who has frequently been compared by good
judges of acting to Mac ready, and not altogether to
the latter's advantage, takes his Annual Benefit at the
Theatre Royal, Muadleton-on-the-Slime, next Thurs-
day, ou which occasion a monstre attendance may be
confidently expected. Mr. O'Rousi will play Polonius,
perhaps his best character, if we can distinguish where
all are so good. Mr. O'Rouge, in addition to a com-
manding figure, a classic countenance, a mellow voice,
and perfect elocution, is one of the few Actors now left
to us, indeed the only one, capable of grasping the
Immortal Bard's deathless creations."

THE HOUSE THAT VICTOR BUILT.
It being reported that Victor Hugo has just pur-
chased for the sum of £13,000 a piece of land in the
immediate vicinity of his present abode, with a view of
building on it an entirely new house "of his own
designing," the following extract from a preliminary
letter of instructions to the contractor who has under-
taken the work will be read with interest.
• • » • •
You will ask me whether I am an Architect; and I
reply to you, "An Architect is one who constructs."
Do I oonstruct P Yes. What P Never mind; let us
proceed. To construct a house you require a basement.
This is the language of the Contractor. But the Poet
meets him with a rejoinder. A basement is a prison,
and Liberty can not breathe through a grating. This
was the case at the Bastille! What has been done at the
Bastille does not repeat itself. What then? You will
commence the house on the first-floor.
Does this stagger the Architect? Unquestionably!
Yet to commence a house on the first-floor is easy enough.
To the Contractor P No. To the Poet P Yes. How?
By a flight. Two flights will take anyone somewhere.
Upstairs? Yes. Downstairs f Certainly! In my lady's
chamber P Why not P This is a phenomenon, and sur-
prises you. Just now you were on the stare. Now you
are on the first-floor landing. Therefore, you have taken
a rise. Out of whom—the Architect P Possibly. Let us
resume.
And now for the drawing-room.
This will be colossal. Why P Beoause the furniture in
it will be stupendous. To talk of stupendous furniture is
to suggest the opening scene of a Pantomime. A big
head 1 Whose P No matter. But you will inquire as to
this furniture. You will probably say, "Will there be
chairs?" No. "Arm-chairsP" Useless. "Sofas with
six legsP" A phantom! "What thenP Canopied
thrones for four-and-twenty, with one of a superior
make and quality?" Quito so. "Why?" Because
it is here that Genius, after dinner, will meet the Kings
and Emperors that aspire to pay it homage. "Will
there be windows?" Rather—and there is this conve-
nient thing besides— eight-and-forty balconies. You will
say at once, '' Two a-piece?" But you will quickly add—
"What of the gardens beneath P" To this there is only
one answer possible—" Fireworks 1"
Roman candles, rackets, and Bengal lights? No.—
A set-piece? Yes. Representing what P Somebody 1
Now there is this advantage about a set-piece that repre-
sents somebody—if carefully prepared, regardless of
expense, and covering an area of 90 feet by 120. It may be permanent. Some

CHAOS AND COCKROACHES.
[A Communication from our old friend, ilrs. Gingham.)
"Science has just assured us that the Cockroach is of a most prodigiously dignified
antiquity. Specimens have just been discovered in the middle Silurian deposits."
Daily Telegraph.
Well, of all the astrornary things as that dear Daily Telegraft tells us—
Wich well 'tis beknown to us all that it never bamfoozles nor sells us—
This 'ere is the staggerinest go, as it properly calls it perdigious.
Cockroaches as old as the 'ills 1 Gr-r-r.' The notion seems perfeckly hidgeous!
I don't know, exact, what is meant by "the middle Silurian deposits,"
But to think that the crawling Philistians, the pests of our cellars and closets,
Are older than Adam hisself, or the monkey some says that he sprang from,—
The wrigglers that crawl on our floors, and our curtings and bed-postes 'ang from,
That swarm in our rugs and our carpets, and can't be got shut of by beating,
Nor yet by no firewood and beer, nor the powders of good Mister Keating!
I pities them poor dear Silurians; they had no beetle-traps, probable,
And if their " deposits" was large, and the Banks of the period robbable,
They must 'a bin anxious enough, before Pleecemen was ever invented,
Without them Cockroaches in swarms, as I'm sure must 'a drove 'em demented.

SOMETHING IN THE PAPERS.
(Further Correspondence.)
Sir,—As Representatives of a firm' of old-established Paper-stainers, we
have followed with much interest the controversy lately carried on in your
oolumns, on the subject of poisonous colouring matter, maliciously and wrongly
alleged to be employed in our manufacture. Your Correspondent, "A Mys-
terious Sufferer at Brixton," is utterly wrong. What he describes as "a
domestic discomfort, that really robs life of half its enjoyment," is obviously
not referable to the paper of his bedroom, but to some slight constitutional
rangement. What are the facts P Take his own account of himself. I*
says he " wakes in the morning, parched and raving, and, after a succession
appalling fits on the top landing, rolls head-over-heels the whole way down four
flights of stairs, only to finish the day in convulsions on the hall-mat." Now,
Sir, we maintain this is in no way due, as he supposes, to the presence of any
deleterious pigment in the wall-decoration of his room. On referring to our
books, we find this to be an ordinary good old-fashioned emerald-green .leaf
landscape, relieved by copperas pumpkins and soarlet butterflies—heavily
coloured, it is true, but not containing more than a teaspoonful of pure arsenic
in a square yard of it. As to lie further faot he mentions, that "every friend
who passes a night in his houe is invariably carried out on a stretcher, speech-
less, and in a state of oollapse, to the nearest hospital the next morning."
this is, of oourse, nothing more than a mere coincidence, and not worthy the
consideration of busiaess men, endowed with common sense, and dealing with
a plain commercial question. It is these foolish scientific scares, Sir, that are
continually bringing about what is called " depression of trade," and producing
stagnation in a flourishing industry. Trusting to your sense of fair play to give
due prominence to this letter, we are, Sir, yours faithfully,
Choke and Killings.
Sir,—Your Correspondent "Paralyticus" is quite mistaken. The test for
arsenic in wall-paper is extremely simple. Having provided himself with half
a ton of Ammonium Hydrate, freely washed in Salts of Bismuth, let him now
add (H. 0.),, and, forming a thick solution, take a yard of the

question, dipping it carefully from time to time for the space of eight-
and-forty hours, oyer a spirit-lamp, and watching for the precipitate.
If this come quickly, he can have recourse to N. II.,, or even to
(G. O.J, bearing in mind that, as at a temperature of 115°, Per-
oxide of Murium (X. H.)„ which onght now to be exhibited in
email crystals, not only in the suspected portions of the material
bat also on the furniture of the room solidifies and explodes, this
part of the operation had better be conducted in leathern gauntlets,
a wire mask, and cast-iron respirator. Having reached this point,
let him now introduce (U. 0.3), and straining through (0. Y.)„ taste
a small morsel of the paper with his tongue. If there is a giddy
and almost bursting sensation in the head, accompanied by symp-
toms of marsh fever, total deafness, and sudden permanent and
painful enlargement of the knee-joints, then the experiment will
have been entirely successful, and the presence of arsenic will have
been satisfactorily detected. Nothing is easier than this test. A
child can try it. I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,
Investigator.
Sis,—" A Cautious Dineb-Out " asks how, when accepting an
invitation, he can protect himself from the chance of being poisoned
at the house of a friend. I will tell him. Let him take with him
in his cab a good-sized pail of whitewash well mixed with chlorate
of lime, and a common household mop. On arriving at the house of
his host, he leaves these in the hall, and takes a hurried glance at
the room in which the dinner is laid. If he notices that the paper is
of a pale olive-green, sea-blue, madder-pink, delicate fawn, or
shaded with any of the deeper browns or yellows, he has only to
whisk his pail and mop into the room, turn the waiters out, lock the
doors, and set to. He now takes oft his coat, stands on a movable
wheel arm-chair placed on the dinner-table, and goes vigorously to
work, not minding a little inevitable splashing. In less than an
hour and three-quarters he will have covered the whole four walls
from ceiling to floor, and have rendered the room, at a trifling sacri-
fice of appearance, comparatively fresh and wholesome. This is my
invariable practice ; and, though I am not much asked out to dinner,
I can confidently recommend it to those who are.
Yours, &o. In Sanitas Santtatum.
See,—It is to be hoped that the promised Bill that is to be intro-
duced in the coming Session will contain a stringent clause providing
for the hanging respectively of the Ground Landlord, the Builder,
the Papermaker, the Colourman, the Architect, and the House
Agent. Nothing short of this will be of the slightest use. When
this, too, is the law, not only of the rest of Europe but also of
Central Thibet, where even " the friend who recommends the house"
is wisely included in the indictment, why should an enlightened
country like ours lag behind? Surely we have had enough of half-
and-half legislation P Murder is murder; and what we want on
the Statute-Book is to see a spade called a spade. Here am I, and
the whole of my household, thirteen in number, at this present
moment all of us, more or less, crippled, deaf, irritable, imbecile,
epileptic, while seven are, I fear, given over to lasting melancholia
and permanently bed-ridden, owing to the incautious selection of
an attractive dado, guaranteed "pure vegetable colouring," for our
nursery staircase. What, I should like to know, has Sir William
Harcoubt to reply to this P I enclose my card, and beg to subscribe
myself, One who is Fairly Roused.
Sir,—A proper wall-paper, properly made, maybe a positive boon.
Mine are all such, made to my own order. The only colouring
matters used are Carbon and Quinine. The result is, I admit, a dirty
black, and there is no pattern; but the physical outcome is unbounded
health and spirits to my whole family oircle. We dance into the
rooms, skip a bout the landings, and sing on the stairs. Even friends
who come to see us, feel, spite the gloomy look of the house-decora-
tion, the ptrrifying ana invigorating influence of the drugs, and.
bursting into friendly merriment, refuse to leave the premises till
positively turned out by the police. If we are to put medicaments
into our wall-papers, all I can say, Sir, is, don't let them be poisonous
and harmful, but, like those scientifically selected by Your Obedient
Servant, invigorating and all Of tub Bight Sort.
DiorT-BrRBS fob Dinner.—In the recent address of the President
of the Vegetarian Society—as reported—oocurs the following decla-
ration:—
"Such are our principles; we enforce them by moral suasion ... by
cookery classes and Robin dinners."
The Robin is a Warbler, like others of his kin—notably beocafico
and wheatear—good to eat. Was it not Buffon who (without
meaning buffoonery) concluded an account of him with the remark
that: '' This delightful little warbler is eaten with bread-crumbs."
The " Robin dinners " perhaps rank among the triumphs of vegeta-
rian cookery. It may be supposed that the Robin of those repasts is
mock Robin—and no Redbreast.
THE LAY OF THE TRILOBITE.

A mountain's giddy height I
sought.
Because I could not find
Sufficient vague and mighty
thought
To fill my mighty mind.
And, as I wandered ill at ease,
There chanced upon my sight,
A native of Silurian seas,—
An ancient Trilobite!
So calm, so peacefully he lay,
I watched him e'en with tears.
I thought of Monads far away,
In the forgotten years.
How wonderful it seemed, and
right,
The providential plan.
That he should be a Trilobite,
And I should be a Man 1
And then, quite natural and free,
Out of his rocky bed,
That Trilobite he spoke to me,
And this is what ne said:
"I don't know how the thing
was done,
Although I cannot doubt it;
Bnt Huxley,—he if any one
■Can tell you all about it:—
"How all your faiths are ghosts
and dreams,
How, in the silent sea,
Your ancestors were Monotremes—
Whatever these may be,—•
How you evolved your shining
lights
Of wisdom and perfection,
From Jelly-fish and Trilobites,
By Natural Selection.
"You've Kant to make your
brains go round,
And Cabpenteb to clear them,
And Mathematics to confound,
And Mr. Punch to cheer them.
The native of an alien land
You call a man and brother,
And greet with pistol in one
hand,
And hymn-book in the other!
"You've Politics to make you
fight,
And utter exclamations,
You've cannon, and you've
dynamite
To civilise the nations.
The side that makes the loudest
din
Is surest to be right,
And oh, a pretty .fix you 're in I"
Remarked the Trilobite.
"But gentle, stupid, free from
woe,
I dwelt among my nation,
I didn't care, I didn't know,
That I was a crustacean;
I didn't grumble, didn't steal,
I never took to rhyme,
Salt water was my frugal meal,
With carbonate of lime."
Reluctantly I turned away,
No other word he said;
An ancient Trilobite he lay
Within his rocky bed.
I did not answer him, for that
Would have annoyed my pride,
I merely bowed, and touched my
hat,
But in my heart I cried—
"1 wish our brains were not so
good,
I wish our skulls were thicker,
I wish that Evolution could
Have stopped a little quicker.
For oh, it was a happy plight
Of liberty and ease.
To be a simple Trilobite
In the Silurian Seas I"
Too Bad 1—The Poet Laureate has undoubtedly had his eye on
a Title for a long while past. But he certainly looked for something
bevond a mere Baron. How many years ago is it since he sang,
"You must wake and call me Early " P Evidently, Mr. Gladstone
did not wake at the right time, or got out of bed the wrong side, for
assuredly he did not do what his friend expected.

As adroit Humbug hates honest skill, so
muoh the pseudo-Spiritualist hates the avowed
Conjuror. If Mr. iKVDfa Bishop could only
"square" Mr. Maskelyne, he would pro-
bably be less anxious to "round upon " him.
As it is, without laying claim to the power
of "thought-reading, one may readily
divine some of Mr. Ibvlsg Bishop's
"thoughts " respecting Mr. Maskelyitb, and
his chances of getting that Ten Thousand
Pounds! The question is, whether those
thoughts will be worth a penny—to Mr.
Maskelyne.
WHY" BISMARCK HATES THE PREMIER.
Because he has never asked him to break-
fast to meet Mr. Toole.
Because he has never presented him with a
collection of Old China.
Because he has never sent him a really nice
letter on his birthday.
Because he wanted to out down the trees of
"Unter den Linden."
Because he can't speak German fluently.
Because he prefers the banjo to the zither.
Because he never wears the uniform of a
Cuirassier, nor even the undress of a sub-
lieutenant of Yeomanry.
Because he isn't the late Lord Beaconsfield,
Because he has peculiar notions
collars.
Beoause he did not get that joke that was
forwarded to him from Berlin into Punch,
Beoause he neglected to send on New Year's
Day a return Christmas Card.
Beoause his Cabinet is not composed exclu-
sively of men all like Lords Granville and
Debby.
Because, and this is the most important
reason of all, he has allowed himself to be
oalled "The Grand Old Man," when Europe
contains in the person of a certain distin-

grander.

HINTS ON PARLIAMENTARY DEPORTMENT.
(By Professor Turveydrop Toby, M.P.)
phrase onoe used by
Mr. Parnell is calcu-
lated to mislead the
New Member. "I will
not," said the great pa-
triot, "take my coat off
except on the Rent ques-
tion/' The flew Mem-
ber will naturally infer
from this that it is the
practice in the House of
Commons for Members
to take off their coats
when they discuss Bills
before the House, Mr.
Parnell in his wilful
obstinacy affirming that
for his part he would
not take off his coat save
for one particular mea-
sure. This is an error,
and any Member prepa-
ratory to making his
maiden speech, taking
off his coat and present-
ing himself in his shirt-
sleeves, would render
himself liable to reproof
from the Chair.
Private Members must
not put their feet on the back of the bench before them. When they
rise to the status of Minister, or ex-Minister, they may put their
feet on the table. Sir Richard Cross habitually does this, admiring
through his spectacles his bluchers. Sir Richard can only just
reach the table, and sometimes, coming in late at night aweary with
the toils of the day, his ineffectual efforts to land his boots on the
edge of the table have been watched with thrilling interest. Lord
George Hamilton does it with an easy grace that Sir William
Dyke regards with envious admiration. Lord Hartington, too,
manages the table with ease. Mr. Gladstone, on the contrary,
was never seen in this position, nor was the late Mr. Disraeli.
This special privilege of Ministers and ex-Ministers will usefully
incite emulation in the breast of the New Member. In the mean-
time, he must keep his legs down and his spirits up.
This train of thought leads to consideration of the best means by
which a New Member may reach the Treasury Bench. On entering,
he must take a seat somewhere. The question is, "Where P" The
answer, "Below the Gangway." Loyalty to Party is all very well;
but what New Members nave to look after (though they need not
mention it) is their own personal interest, ana it is best looked after
by assuming' an attitude of independence. Note that the' present
Ministry, with few exceptions, is recruited from below the Gangway.
The position is not so uncomfortable as the phrase would imply.
The New Member probably imagines a plank bridging a certain
spaoe, and, below, a number of Members huddled together. It is
not so. Members taking up a position below the Gangway are as
comfortably seated as in any other part of the House.
If it be possible, secure a corner seat. These are limited in number,
and the demand is brisk ; but there is no freehold. You have as much
right as anyone else to a corner seat, and the best thing to do is
boldly to take it. Be in time, and drop into the seat unconcernedly.
If anyone comes up—Mr. Goschen, for example, or Mr. T. B. Potter,
earlier squatters—there are two courses open to you: either pretend
not to see them, or oheerily enter into conversation with them.
Remark on the fineness of the day or otherwise; inquire after their
health and that of various members of their family. They will soon
tire of standing, and wiU seek a Beat elsewhere. Do this every day
for a fortnight, and you will be troubled no longer.
Avoid the corner seat on the bench behind the Treasury. That is
Mr. Forster's, and he has a Short Way with Interlopers. He has
come to sit down, and he sits. If there's anybody there, so muoh
the worse for him. Dr. Lyons discovered this. He gallantly stuck
to his place for three nights ; by that time visibly he began to Mat ten
out,"* To avoid fatal consequences, he withdrew. Mr. Forster rather
missed him at first, but got used to normal hardness of bench, and all
goes well.
New Members must guard against too literal interpretation of
phrases they may from time to time oatch. When they hear a
gentleman bawling out, "Hear! hear!" they must not respond,
Where ? where t Nor when the Speaker cries, " Order! order!
must they turn towards the white-neoktied attendants (who tertainly
look like waiters), and say: "Well, since you are in the room, I
think I '11 take a lemon-squash;" or " Bring me a soda with a little
drop of whiskey and a bit of ice in it, and look sharp!" Again, when
the Speaker cries, "Ayes to the right. Noes to the left!" they must
not attempt impossible contortions of the features. The Sergeant-at-
Arms might suspect they were making faces at him, and would run
them through. He thinks nothing of running a New Member
through.
To sum up; the best thing a New Member can do is to sit
silent and watchful through the two first Sessions, making himself
familiar with the rules of the House. In the third year—in
the springtime whilst nature is buoyant—he may prepare his maiden
speech. Having written it carefully out, let him lock the MS. in
his desk. At Christmastime, let him bid all his poor relations to a
banquet, and after dinner let him deliver the speech to them. He
may try this again in the fourth year. A few of the more pursy of
his poor relations, suspecting something, may decline the invitation:
but he will have a sufficient audience to whom, between the soup and
the fish, he may read his speech. This may be the same one or a
fresh effort. In the fifth year he wiU be quite safe in summoning
the family oircle, for it will not gather. In the sixth Session
Parliament is pretty sure to be dissolved. Thus he will have accom-
plished a double good. He will for ever have got rid of his poor
relations, and will in the House of Commons have established a high
charaoter as a man of profound thought and potential eloquence.
TO AN AMATEUR ACTRESS.
[The Season of Amateur Theatricals has set in with unusual severity.]
They laud the Drama's "palmy
days"
And rave to modern folks' amaze,
Of Kean and Kemblk;
They tell how Siddons trod the
stage,
With inspiration, while her rage,
Made people tremble.
Another Sarah leads the van,
With Irving, fasoinating man,
And Ellen Terry;
In comedy, by far too rare,
We honour Stirling's silver
hair,
And Toole makes merry.
But what avails the well-paid
Stage,
The genius of our modern age
We oan't arrive at;
Until we've seen you pose, ma
belle,
Who act we know supremely well,
And play in private.
You banish Bernhardt from our
dreams,
And Ellen Terry only seems,
A phantom figure;
They act.foiks say, by light of Art,
But you from impulse and from
heart,
Are vastly bigger.
Your Juliet attracts all eyes,
Though Mary Anderson arise
Your naive rendition,
Beats all that she could ever do
Though charmed by wreathen
arms we view
Each new position.
In Comedy you give delight.
In Irish characters you might
Have come from Carlow;
And when Miss Hardcastle
appears.
Would I could be, despite my
years—
That blest young Marlow.
Don't tell me aoting is no more:
In theatres perchance 'tis o'er,
But one thing's certain,
The drawing-room preserves it
still,
What time so many parts you fill,
Behind the curtain.
When Critics ask who can play
"lead,"
They simply should see, I would
plead,
What you can do, dear;
In drawing-rooms you 're all the
rage,
But still I would not tempt the
stage,
If I were you, dear.
"Company" Manners.
"Two's oompany," thought those ingenious gentlemen, Mr.
Frederick Pope ana Mr. James Prior; but they did not follow
proverbial philosophy so far as to add that three—or even five—were
none. So they started the International Fish Dinner Company on a
capital of some dozen pounds or so. Then, no doubt, they and their
partners sang with gusto "The Best of all Good Companie." But
a partial jury found them guilty of Fraud and Conspiracy, and they
will have the opportunity of testing the truth of the poet's dictum
that " Stone walls do not a prison make." This is so far satisfac-
tory; but surely if the public would pay just a leetle more attention
to the simple copy-book maxim, "Be careful of your Company,"
these co-operative fishers of men would not hook so many flats.
A Stranger presented himself for the defence, sa -ing he was a
Member of the Bar. "Whioh Bar?" asked the Magistrate. "Pot-
ter's Bar, Eastern Circuit," replied the applicant. Ejected.

ILLOGICAL GRUMBLING.
Mr. Punch, Sir,
I am a Free-Trader. I have sucked in its doctrines from the
all-hut-inspired lips of its two great apostles, Richard Cobden and
John Bright, so now can I help being a Free-Trader. Free Trade
is as the air we breathe, if we have it not we die. The whole of the
ten commandments of our lofty commercial nature are embodied in
the immortal principle, " Buy in the cheapest markets and sell in the
dearest." Every weak thought, every absurd fact, every silly state-
ment as to results, every lazy ory that "We have no work to do!"
that seeks to make me waver in my firm faith, in my profound con-
viction, I have always thrown aside with that mocking laugh of
pitying contempt that marks the man with whom faith supersedes
reason. Judge then, Sir, of my utter astonishment when I find
thoughtless men, unable to grasp this great question,—if indeed it
oan now be called a question—in its vast entirety, are trying to gain
my sympathy for mere individual suffering. Every great principle
must have its martyrs, and martyrs should learn to bear their
martyrdom, not only uncomplainingly, but with a kind of rapture of
endurance. 1
But, Sir, what do I find? Being a man with ample leisure, I have
been devoting myself, during the last few weeks, to a searching
inquiry into certain oases of supposed grievance at the East End of
London, and what is the result r Take the case of a man I have
known for years as a steady, sober, hard-working, Joiner. The firm
that has employed him for years find that they can import their
goods from abroad much cheaper than they can make them, so with
that true cosmopolitan feeling that animates true Free-Traders, they
dismiss their English workmen and import their goods from abroad.
This man is so unreasonable as to complain of his lot. He talks
about his wife and four children, ana of his little home being
gradually stripped of its contents, and of his tramping about day
after day in a vain attempt to get employment, and all, as he
foolishly says, because foreigners are allowed to send us their goods
free, but refuse to take ours on the same terms. Can anything be
more illogical? As I tell him, if he cannot find work in one trade he
must try another. But the foolish fellow says he only knows one
trade, and is too old to learn another, and what is to become of him
and his during the winter, heaven only knows, and he adds, there
are probably over a thousand in his trade as badly oS as he is.
Strange to say, although I repeated to him some of the most un-
answerable arguments of Free-Trade policy. I failed somehow to
convince him that he ought to be perfectly satisfied, as, theoretically,
he has really nothing to complain of.
As I was about to leave him, a pale-faced, half-starved, gaunt-
looking fellow came in, and, seeing me, was about to leave, but my
friend called him in and said, " I wish, Ned, you'd tell this gentle-
man your little story; he's making some inquiries down here about
the distress."
So Ned told me his little story, which he said was about the same
story as hundreds of others could tell me down there. He was a
sugar-baker by trade. His employers had been struggling on for
years against foreign competition but had at length succumbed, and
the works were closed and all hands dismissed.
I, of course, expressed my regret for his bad luok, and tried some
of my very strongest arguments to oonvinoe him that it must be right
to buy in the cheapest market, when he turned almost fiercely upon
me, and said. "Not if they are stolen goods, I suppose, Sir! and
where's the difference? The Frenoh and German Governments pay
their sugar-growers and refiners a very large bounty upon all the
sugar they export to this country. Why)' Out of love for us?
Certainly not, but to ruin us all that are employed in the trade, as
they 're very qniokly doing, and then they '11 have all the trade in
their own hands and oan charge what thev like! Ah, Sir." he con-
tinued, "I'm all for Free Trade, I am, if Trade was only free to all,
and all had their fair share of work to do. _ That's where I get
muddled, you see. What we want down here is more work, it isn't
anything wicked. I suppose to ask for more work? Ay, and more
work we must have, or something will happen that I, for one, shall
be sorry to see! But men oughtn't to be left to starve, and what's
more, men won't starve! Look at me. A hearty, strong, hale fellow
as you'd wish to see, only three months ago, wasn't I, Joe? Look
at me now, half-starvea, willing to work, longing for work, and
half-starved, and all through our wicked laws."
He went toward the door, and turning round, said to me, "The

fact is, there's too many of us for the work there is to do, and unless
something's done to alter it, as there seems to he plenty of every-
thing, judging by the price, some of us will be thinking about help-
ing themselves." Ana he stalked away, leaving me speechless with
astonishment.
The wonderful obstinacy of this olass of people is perfectly asto-
nishing, and their ignorance of the laws that govern demand and
supply simply lamentable. Arguments that I have heard made use
of in the House of Commons itself, and received with a oheer of
approval, were utterly wasted on these otherwise intelligent men.
Nay, more, they actually seemed to think that their bitter experi-
ence as regards certain elementary facts, was of far more value, and,
to them, of far more importance, than the almost sublime theories by
which I vainly endeavoured to convince them that everything was as
well regulated as possible in this best of all possible countries, and
that the parental Legislature that so kindly condescended to make
the laws by which so glorious a result was produced, must naturally
know more about these abstruse matters than mere working-men,
who only thought of what was best for themselves and their families,
instead of taking that enlarged and comprehensive view that enables
the philosophical Free-Trader to look with calm indifference upon
the bitter sufferings of his own countrymen, rather than yield one
jot, one tittle, of the grand and noble principle that it is our duty as
men, as brethren, ana as Christians, to buy in the cheapest market,
be the consequences what they may. J. Liiaufe.
When Mrs. Ramsbotham was informed that the new Hatchett's
Hotel was opened the other day, and that the Old White Horse
Cellars were still there just the same as in the old coaching days, she
couldn't understand it, and observed, "But what an age the old
White Horse must be 1 And how is it they haven't sold him long
ago?" But, on reconsideration, the excellent Lady remarked, "Ah,
I suppose it was only people who had white horses to sell went
there—a sort of speciality 1 know. I used to see the hundred-bladed
knife-sellers and the dogoollar-sellers there a long time ago, so I
suppose they '11 oome baok again, too, now that the old ~~
sellers have been re-established."

PUBLIC GRIEVANCES.
(By Our Own Inspector.)
No. II.—The River.
The shameful oondition of the River last year, and the perfectly
monstrous claims put forth by a number of grasping gentlemen
oalled Riparian Owners, appear, judging from the voluminous com-
plaints I have received upon the subjeot, to form a public grievance
of no ordinary charaoter. I append a small selection:—
Sib,—I am the Captain of a vessel running from the Thames to
Scotland. I have known the river, man and boy, for thirty years.
I denounce its condition for many months of last year, not only as a
public grievance, but as a shame, a disgrace, and a scandal, to all
oonoerned. It gets worse and worse year by year. Scotchmen are
generally considered to be-not over particular as regards the sense of
smell. We all remember the sneer at "Sweet Edinburgh, I smell
thee still!" Bat I declare that my experience of old Edinburgh
teaches me that the Modern Athens is far sweeter than the Thames,
from Gravesend to the Pool, during the greater part of the year.
Not only so, but the grand river itself is rapidly silting up with the
filth of the Metropolis—so much so, that I oan only run up on the
top of the tide. If two or three of the bumptious idiots who are
responsible for this awful, ay, and cruel state of things, were made
to bathe just below Crossness every summer morning, just after high
water, they would probably cease from insulting us by saying that
the matter is exaggerated. I have great faith in my Countrymen's
power of using strong language, but I doubt if the strongest of them
could find words that could fairly be oalled an exaggeration of this
hideous, disgusting, and wicked grievanoe. D. C.
P.S.—I am not muoh of a Poet myself, but my second Mate is, and
he has written the following improvement upon Tom Moobe; to be
sung by the Chairman of the Metropolitan Board of Works at
Crossness :—
Flow on thou slimy River,
But e'er thou reach the sea,
Take all these tons of sewage
That I now pour in thee.
Sra,—I am an Angler—my humorous friends call me a patient
Angler. I accept the name with pleasure. I am a patient Thames
Angler, though I do stand six feet two in my stockings. For
many long years I have sought my chief delight in the upper
waters of the still beautiful Thames, and found there such a haven
of rest for my poor over-taxed brain, that I have returned to my
quiet home refreshed and invigorated, and prepared to resume my
daily toil with cheerfulness and alacrity. During the last year or
two, however, I have been occasionally interrupted in my harmless
pastime by shouts and threats from certain angry individuals, oalled,
I believe,Riparian Owners, ordering me to leave the water opposite
their sacred properties. I have paid but little attention to them,
generally speaking; but last season, while fishing at my favourite
spot, near Maidenhead, I was ordered off by a hulking bully of a
fellow; and, as I did not obey his orders, he sent in a big brute of a
dog, close to my punt, and spoilt all my fishing for that evening. I
then pulled, or rather pushed, my punt as near to him as I ooultt get,
and addressed him as follows:—
"I have been acouBtomed for years to fish near this spot, and I
intend to continue doing so; and if at any future time you dare to
send that remarkably fine animal into the water for the wanton
purpose of spoiling my harmless, but healthful sport, I will shoot it,
or horsewhip you, just as I feel most inclined to do when the time
comes!"
I left him speechless with astonishment, and have not been molested
there since. There are some ten thousand of us Anglers in London
and its neighbourhood, and we quite intend to angle in the River
Thames. Verb. sap. 'R. 8.
Bra,—Do you wish to see how a beautiful River can be turned into
a muddy ditoh P—come to Twickenham at low-water—or, perhaps I
ought rather to say, at no water. Do you want to study the bed of the
River Thames?—come to Twickenham Ait at low-water, just where
cricket was played last season. Do you want to study the peculiarly
offensive nature of Thames Sewage Mud ?—try to cross the River at
Twickenham Perry at low-water. Do you wish to find a special spot on
our onoe beautiful River where the stench would rival any of those for
whioh Cologne was once so famous?—seek it just below Kingston
Bridge; your nose will guide you to the favoured spot. And, finally. Do
you want to know what was the state of the River last summer, when
examined by the Inspector of the Local Government Board?—read the
following extract from his Report, and then, Sir, marvel at the folly
of those who have this matter in charge, and their imbeoility in
dealing with it:—" In August last" he says, "there was a month's
sewage from the Metropolis oscillating backwards and forwards
between Greenwich and Teddington, and the Thames could only be
compared to a huge sewage-tank which for many months had not
been cleaned out!' I thank you heartily, Sir, for allowing me to
call attention to this terrible publio grievanoe.
Twickenham.
W. R.
Srs,—I am a Boating Man. Rather! I didn't pull in the Cam-
bridge Eight, with Goldie for stroke, in 1873, without knowing
something about boating. It's the be-all and end-all of my holiday
existence; and it's only the Thames that makes London life
endurable. But there's mischief brewing, and I want to give our
enemies fair warning. The great charm of sculling is in exploring
the beautiful backwaters, and we boating men have found, during
the last season, that certain Riparians, as they are called, have ques-
tioned our right to do so, and some miscreants have even staked
them, to prevent our entrance; and some few, with a refinement of
cruelty worthy of a Red Indian, have even shortened the stakes, so
as to make them invisible to the unpractised eye—with consequences
easily imagined. Now, there are a deoentish number of Boating
Clubs on the Thames, and we reckon our members by thousands:
and we are not at all a puny, or enervated, or timid race of men;
and we merely wish to state, in the calmest and most gentlemanly
manner, that as we have done in the past, so we intend to do in the
future, and if any trouble should arise, as it very possibly may, from
very obstinate men endeavouring to prevent our doing so, they will
have only themselves to thank for whatever disagreeable conse-
quences may ensue—to them. M. L. R. C.
Sib,—I dunno what's come to the River lately, but it seems all
a-running away from hereabouts. Me and my mates, we think as
it's all owing to the great dredgers as makes a deep channel in the
middle of the stream, and consekwently leaves all the rest, at low
water, nothing but stinking mud, and plays the very deuce with all
us poor watermen here. Couldn't you, Sir, just manage to get all
this put right. If you would like to see it, and to smell it, we 11 any
of us give you a row for nothing, just about low water, any day you
like to come.

Though the moat is full of water, there's no ghostly skiff thereon;
We still watch for you at midnight, but our souls are all undaunted.
Have you given up business, Spectres; is your occupation gone P
Have you fled because jpu shudder at our psychical researches—
Is the age too unbelieving for your pale phantasmal hosts?

Killed at the Battle of Abu-Klea, in the Soudan, January 17th, 1885.
Bbave Bubnaby down! Wheresoever 'tis spoken
The news leaves the lips with a wistful regret.
We picture that square m the desert, shocked, broken,
Yet packed with stout hearts, and impregnable yet.
And there fell, at last, in close melie, the fighter,
Who Death had so often affronted before.
One deemed he'd no dart for his valorous slighter
Who such a gay heart to the battle-front bore.
But alas! for the spear-thrust that ended a story
Romantio as Roland's, as Lion-Heart's brief I
Yet crowded with incident, gilded with glory,
And crowned by a laurel that's verdant of leaf.
A latter-day Paladin, prone to adventure,
With little enough of the spirit that sways
The man of the market, the shop, the indenture!
Yet irrief-drops will glitter on Bubnaby's bays.
Fast friend as keen fighter, the strife-glow preferring,
Yet cheery all round with his friends and his foes;
Content through a life-story short, yet soul-stirring
And happy, as doubtless he'd deem, in its close.
Thou that in everv field of earth and sky
Didst hunt for Death, who seemed to flee and fear,
How great and greatly fallen dost thou lie,
Slain in the desert by a nameless spear!
"Not here, alas 1" may England say, "not here,
In suoh a quarrel was it meet to die;
But in that dreadful battle drawing nigh,
To shake the Afghan mountains lone and sere!"
Like Aias by the ships, shouldst thou have stood,
And in some pass have stayed the stream of fight,
The bulwark of thy people and their shield,
Till Helmund or till Lora ran with blood,
And back, towards the Northlands and the Night,
The stricken EaglesTscattered from the field!
THE OUT-OF-BOUNDARY COMMISSION.
South-East-by-West Loamshire.
Ma job Foote Roole, R.E., held an inquiry last week at the
County Hall, Muddlestickleborough, to hear objections and sugges-
tions as to the proposals of the Commissioners. There was a large
and noisy attendance, amongst those pn-sent being the Earl of
DrrcHWATEB, Mr. Softsoap Sawdeb, M.P., Mr. Whigblock (the
Recorder of Little Beerborough), the Mayors of Muddlestickleborough,
Great Taturs, Pedlington Minor, and many others.
The Commissioner referred to the principle upon which the Com-
mission had proceeded. Loamshire was certainly agricultural,
although there was a strong mining population in parts, with here
and there a large number of mill-hands. Roughly, the County
Division they were considering had a population of 200,000. They
proposed to divide it into four Divisions, each returning a Member.
The first of the four would comprise Brummagum, Waddleton, Ban-
gsborough, Monkshole, and Mudd-under-Fogg. As the first-named
of these places was infinitely the largest, the Division would be
called after it
The Constable of Mudd-under-Fogg (who also filled eight other
local Municipal offices) complained bitterly of unfairness. He said
that Mudd-under-Fogg was a very ancient place, and appeared in
Domesday Book. Under these oiroumstances, it would be scandalous
not to allow the Division to be called Mudd-under-Fogg.
Mr. Fossil scoffed at this idea, and deolared that Mudd-under-
Fogg could not be found in any top"graphioal dictionary. Why not
call the Division " Monkshole P He could assure the Commissioner
it contained a very ornamental pump, and was altogether a remark-
able place. He lived there himself.
The Commissioner thought that in spite of the arguments of the
two last speakers, that perhaps the better name would be Brummagum,
for the reasons he had already given. The other Divisions would
be composed respectively of Bosnington, Littlebat, and Slumborough;
of Mugby Junction, Anvhow, and Upham-Parkroadstone, and Lark-
ington, Great Bangs, Nightoapp-Cotton, Harvey-under-Sorse, and
Little Beerborough. He could assure those present that the Com-
mission had taken much care in the preparation of their scheme,
and would gladly hear any suggestion.
Mr. Bbasslungs said that after this invitation he had no hesitation
in declaring that the Franohise Act was a fraud, and the proposed
Seats Bill a scandal to civilisation.
The Commissioner suggested that the remarks of Mr. Bbasslungs
were more suitable to a meeting of the Vestry than a gathering suoh
as that then present. He (the Commissioner) did not wish to sup-
press argument, but there was always a fixed latitude.
Mr. Bbasslungs. But not a fixed longitude. {Laughter.) I shall
be another two hours longer at the very least. (Cheers.)
The speaker then went on to say that Britannia rules the Waves,
he did not believe in Fair Trade, he considered the charges of the
Parcels Post excessively high, and objected on principle to the
imposition of the Income Tax.
The Commissioner again interposed to explain that, although there
was a great deal of interest in what Mr. Bbasslungs was saying, yet,
striotly speaking, his remarks were not exactly germane to the matter
they had met together to discuss.
Upon this Mr. Bbasslungs angrily left the room, declaring that
the Commissioner was " in a ring and had been tampered with."
Mr. Whigblock, as Recorder for Little Beerborough, announced
that at the last meeting of the Court of Quarter Sessions, a Com-
mittee of Magistrates had been appointed to consider the plan of the
Commission. That Committee would support the Commission, sup-
posing that instead of four divisions there were fourteen, and that
all the suggested groupings were radically changed. Thus they
would transfer Mudd-under-Fogg, which consisted only of four
inhabitants, from the first to the fourth division, and transpose two-
thirds of the boroughs now appearing in the second division to the
third. He was not quite sure if he had made himself dearly under-
stood. To be frank, he was forced to admit that he had considerable
doubt about his own meaning. However, that was the decision of
the Committee to whom he referred, and he trusted the Commissioner
would take their suggestion into his most favourable consideration.
The Commissioner cordially assented to his request, and asked if
any Gentleman had any further remarks to make upon this Bubjeot.
Mr. Bbown said he oertainly considered the polioy of the Govern-
ment as regards Egypt was open to the gravest observation.
The Commissioner said that this would scarcely be time or place
for a speech upon the matter.
Mr. Jones, as a friend of Mr. Bbown, disagreed with the Commis-
sioner. The Government polioy abroad was of much importance to
the country in general, and to Big Twaddleton (of whioh borough he,
the speaker, was proud to say he was a native) in particular.
Mr. Robinson expressed similar views, at great length.
The Commissioner said as he did not wish to lay himself open to the
charge of burking discussion—(" Hear, hear.'")—he had permitted
the last three speakers to say what they pleased. (Loud cheering.)
However, he was bound to tell them that what Messrs. Bbown, Jones,
and Robinson had said was entirely irrelevant to the subject before
them. (" No, no ! ") Had any other Gentleman a remark to offer'(
Mr. Kosrs, on behalf of the Conservative Association, suggested a
counter-scheme to that proposed by the Commission, which differed
from it in every particular.
Mr. Fees (Agent for the Liberal Association) also suggested a
counter-scheme from an opposite point of view, equally hostile to
the provisions suggested by the Commissioners.
After three hours of hot discussion, that brought into view the
fact that the rival schemes raised so many points of difficulty and
detail that it was quite impossible to reconcile them—
The Earl of Ditchvwateb thought that on the whole it was much
better to accept the fiuding of a perfeotly independent body like that
of the Commissioners. (Cheers, groans, jeers and hisses.) Well
would thev have the Liberal soheme—(" No,no.'")—or the Conserva-
tive— (" No, no."'),—or any other— (" No, no!"). Well then all that
remained was the scheme of the Commission—(laughter)— and they
must make the best of it like good citizens, excellent neighbours—
he would go further and say—like worthy representatives of those
men who, in the glorious days of old, had won for them Waterloo,
Trial by Jury, Cheap Bread, and last, but oertainly not least, Magna
Charta. (Loud and prolonged cheering.)
The Commissioner, in acknowledging a vote of thanks, promised
that the most oareful consideration should be given to the suggestions
(many of them most valuable, and all of them extremely interesting)
that had been offered to him. The proceedings then terminated.
FOG.
Thott comest in familiar guise.
When in the morning I awake,
You irritate my throat and eyes,
I vow that life's a sad mistake.
You oome to hang about my hair,
My much-enduring lungs to
clog,
I feel you with me everywhere,
Our own peculiar London Fog.
You clothe the City in suoh gloom,
We scarce can see across the
street,
You seem to penetrate, each room,
And mix with everything I eat.
I hardly dare to stir about,
But sit supine as any log;
You make it torture to go out,
Our own peculiar London Fog.

THAT TYRANT GIRL!
"Young girls are not allowed to read Novels, and vet are
taken to the Theatre. This accounts for the weakness of many
English plays." — Mr. W. B. Gilbert, at reported
"Workers and their Work," in the Daily Newt.
That Tyrant Girl, that Tyrant Girl!
With her plum-prim mouth, and her hair a-curl!
Arch-despot she of a mawkish aire,
She lowers Art, and she spoils the Stare!
What could not we do were it not for her?
The sewers of sense we could probe and stir,
Show Messalina in Mayfair fray,
And—all the rest that I may not say.
But no, she comes with her saucer eyes,
Her look of imbecile gauche surprise;
Her blush, her giggle, her plentiful lack
Of cool aplomb, with her rigid back
And prim-pinched elbows, virginal, void,
And —Art's best means must be unemployed.
Vascular passion, and virile wit
Will not do for tne staring chit.
Human nature on whioh she'd look
Must be strained through her copy-book.
So as—all in her interest,—
Ootda and Beouohton are robbed of zest!—
Plays are purged, or if not quite that,
Rendered illogical, fade and flat.
Poor Pygmalion veils the nude,
And all because of this prim-chin'd prude,
This Tartine-e&tei in tarlatan,
Who clips the tastes of woman and man
Down to her own Procrustes-crib,
All to the measure of tucker and bib.
She read OtrrDA? Oh! never! never!
(So says Gilukkt, and he is clever)
If she does, it is on the sly.
But she comes with her glassy eye,
Sits and stares from a private box.
Power, or passion, or aught that shocks"
Palsying out of the playwright's soul.
Pity him, baulked of his Art's true goal,
Capuan orgie, Bacchanal whirl.
All on account of that Tyrant Girl!
A Hard Case.—When it has to be submitted to Counsel
through the perfectly unnecessary intermediation of a fre-
quently ill-informed and invariably superfluous Solicitor.
WORTH HAVING.
The remarkable interest manifested by a certain portion of the
public in the recent sale of Mr. Herman's "Dramatic Collection"
has, as was only to be expeoted, already inspired several other
Theatrical Virtuosi with the happy idea of sending some of their
choicest treasures to the hammer. A perusal of the few following
items, taken at random from the pages of the forthcoming Catalogue
of the auction in question, will suffioe to warrant the presumption
that the bidding, in point of mere liveliness, will show no falling off
from that chronicled at the rooms of Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson,
and Hodge, last week.
Lot 13. The Original Pair of Patent Leather Morning Shoes worn
by Mr. Irving when bounding joyously up the Companion Ladder to
look over the side of the vessel at the Reporter of the New York
Herald, on the occasion of his first visit to America.
Lot 27. Curious document (in rare MS.), defining and explaining
the troublesome and intricate process by which Mr. Herman and
Mr. Wills collaborated amicably, and without the aid of their re
speotive Solicitors, on getting Claudian to its final state of fitness for
Stage representation.
Lot 34. The Identical Sixpence paid by Mr. Wilson Barrett
that led to his subsequent Lesseeship of the Princess's Theatre, the
production of Hamlet, and the ultimate preparation of a Five-Act
Drama, of startling interest, to replace it as soon as possible.
Lot 105. Working Model of Mr. W. S. Gilbert's celebrated
"Shoot Letter Box," showing important portion of Libretto of a new
Opera, intended for the Printers, and marked "Immediate," stuck
immovably half-way, without the cognisance and beyond the reach
of the unconscious Butler.
Lot 131. Original Letter from a Fair West-End Manageress,
offering Mr. Sparkler "a cup of tea, or coffee, or both,—with a
bisouit," on the firBt night of a new Five-Aot Play.
Lot 172. Authentio Correspondence of Mr. Augustus Harris
with various distinguished celebrities in Church and State, on the
subject of the moral influence and realistio effects of Drury Lane
Drama. Twenty-two Volumes, imperial quadruple quarto, hand-
somely bound in purple velvet (jewelled edges), and profusely
illustrated with three full life-sized portraits in oils of himself
in three different characters, and highly-coloured half-lengths of the
various correspondents.
Lot 204. Unilluminated Round Robin of ex-Prizetakers of the
Dramatic School of Art (sixty-seven signatures), complaining that
"they've got no work to do," and threatening the President, in
verse, that they '11 soon make it hot for somebody."
Lot 239. Draft Menu of Capuan Banquet, together with the
numbers of the several ten-pound notes, as placed by a well-known
and successful West-End Manager in the dinner-napkins of the
leading Dramatic Critics on the night of a dress-rehearsal of a new
"Shakspearian Upholstery Revival."
Lot 259. Anonymous Letter from the Manager of a first-class
West-End Theatre to the Lobd Chancellob of England, enclosing
two complimentary admissions to the upper boxes during a temporary
and peculiar state of the business, necessitating the announcement
that the free list is entirely suspended."
Lot 310. Curious and hnmorous letter from the Official Licenser
of Plays to the Editor of Truth, suggesting that he might offer his
next two-guinea prize for the best rational solution of the principle
on which the Lobd Chamberlain appears occasionally to wink with
one eye and be blind with the other.
All the lots have a special value of their own, and the sale cannot
fail to excite a keen interest among that particular class to whioh it
makes appeal.
The Report of the House Publio Lands Committee on the Bill pro-
hibiting alien foreigners from acquiring or owning land in the United
States, says :—" We maintain that American soil should be owned
exclusively by American citizens." Ahem! Mr. Winans, please copy.

COMPETITIVE MARRIAGES.
That naughty, wioked, waggish National Review, suggests Com-
petitive Matches,—matches between names who shall be big guns

gether—for they are divided couples, as yet.
There is a Lady hard at work on Conic Sections, and who has already
taken a double-first in Sanscrit, and she only requires a poetic kind
of young man who knows a lot about Scandinavian mythology. The
result of the examinations are rather disappointing for her, because
her partner turns out to be an old Gentleman, in blue spectaoles, who
has been going up for his degree in the Infinitesimal Calculus for the
last thirty-five years, and has at last succeeded.
Then our Prizeman in Anoient History—the coming Nikbuhr—re-

and the Lady who corresponds to his number carries off all the palms

getting gradually reconciled to the Renaissance poetry—it is suoh a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PRINCESS GEORGES.
Whereto have we come? To what level has play-oraft sunk P Is
this age to be the Millennium of Millinery P and are vapid vapourings
on diluted French perfumes to be the true essence of British Drama
played by English people to English people P Oar growl is an honest
one. As Thackeray thundered over the misdoings of the Four
Georges, so we must let loose our playful lightnings at the most
recent Princess of that ilk.
The play is of the very worst kind of Gallic sententiousness; there
isn't a solitary soul in it to love, and a play without someone in it to
care for is the feeblest and dullest of all mortal imaginative works.
It is the worst, most un-human, and illogical patchwork of nonsense
that ever Dumas flls—dramatic moralist and aphorist—ever spun out
of his tortuous brain. Not a oharacter in it lights a scintilla of sym-
pathy. The wicked woman is a crimson infamy; the hirsute
husband is a brutal bushranger. Barbe- Bleue at the Comedy is a
bit of gentility compared with the Sarba Rossa of the Prince's. De
Birac is an unmitigated scoundrel. The Notary is a bore, and the
Valet and the Lady's-maid may be " character parts," and are cer-
tainly well played, but respectable folk would decidedly give neither
of them a character, and most certainly part with them were they
unfortunately included in any modern menage. The people who

crowd the Stage (there are ten folk all on at once) are recklessly
decolletees when in petticoats, and stupid and stiff when in corre-
sponding garments of another cut. When not busy breaking the
Decalogue, they engage in a sort of nervous gossip that neither
interests nor excites. But then their dresses are amazing! What
the "Milliner's Bill" of this Play must have been, possibly Mr.
Godfrey only knows!
Then we have strings of those wearisomely trite sayings
called "aphorisms," that strangle and retard all good play-
progress. "You will not be the first woman and you will not he
the last woman who has parted from her husband for no fault of her

"Reserved Force."—Act I.
own;" "Men forgive, women forget;" "It is not your fault if you
love some one who does not love you, or if you love some one who
does love you, or if you both love each other, or don't love each
other; or, We quote the entangled passage from memory, but we
protest to this hour that people in plays ought to do things, and not
think things. Only the genius of a Shakspeare could make such copy-
book headings part and. parcel of a oharacter. However, the play has
been subjected all round to dignified and sane abuse. It would have
taken the collective powers of the Nine Muses to have redeemed it by
acting. As it is, the central part is played with lovely, but insipid
inanity. The stone Venus, the Galatea behind the curtain, wears
charming frocks, and looks very sweet—that is all.
What Mrs. Langtry once was, is a matter of modern social
history. How photographers fumed, fretted, and focussed over her,
how poets poetised about her, how the publio stared at her at those
odd functions that are oddly enough called "Private" Views, and

Another Society Scene.—Act II.
how she made her first bow to the Haymarket-Gardeners and Garde-
nias as Miss Hardcastle at the Bancrofteries, is known to all social
students. Now, this undoubtedly beautiful lady challenges criticism
as an Actress. Habet! Her voice is gentle and sweet. Her tread
is well-balanced and majestic, the line from throat to ear is strong,
clear cut, and has a graceful sweep—possibly the only instance of a
sweep being at once snow-white and graceful—the eyes are clear
and bright, and the straight brows are, as poet-persons would say,
the lintel over the doorway of a shrine, wherein lies a beautiful souk
The figure, in its English, not French sense, is graceful, undulant,
and intensely Hellenic (If you don't know what "intensely Hel-
lenic" is, you had better take a course of Oscar.) And she wears
lovely and evidently expensive frocks with perfect ease and grace-
fulness. But while all the world admits that she is decidedly a
"pretty player," she is certainly not an Actress. Her voice drops
at the end of every sentence. Her gestures are feeble and
narrow; there is no certainty about her ways and movements; her
most obvious faults are self-consciousness and want of energy; her
charms lie in a seeming innocent ignorance of all method and plan
and purpose.
To lady-lecturers on the Drama it might be suggested as a theme or
thesis that breadth of gesture, passion, and decision of voioe-inflec-
tion, are better things than self-consciousness, beauty, notoriety,
condescending feebleness, and exquisite French gowns, as passports

to dramatic fame and success, even when assisted by such admirable
translations from the Frenoh as " you and me," and the mildest pos-
sible method of softly whispering "I '11 turn you out of the house,"
which last sentence the Beautiful One delivers after a fashion that
has about it quite the ring of " I '11 strike you with a feather!"
Here is indeed a moment wholly lost. Turning her "hated
rival" out of her husband's house, Mrs. Langtry behaves like one
of Helen's Babies, frightened at a growling mechanical bear, not
like a justly enraged wife, with her blood up, crimsoning cheeks,
and nerving every tone and action. Possibly it is as much the play-
wright's fault as the player's that these things are so. In some
more gentle line, with better and simpler lines to talk, the Lovely One

(for whom there is no necessity to work, if
the report of her enormous gains in America
he true) may yet do something: worthy of
the Histrionic Art.
Now for the verbum directum or straight
tip as to the rest. Miss Amy Roselle plays
it "very low down " on the Beauty in an
ugly, unsympathetic part. She acts bravely.
The rest of the Ladies that make up the
Society party of the Second Act are dis-
tinctly uncomfortable and ill at ease spite of
their Worth-j, if not worshipful, snipped-
away frocks. Place. aux homines.' Mr.
Coonlan of the sleek black hair opposed an
obstinate resistance to the various tempta-
tions to be virtuous that the play offers him,
but even "Reserved Force" is no remedy
for the inherent viciousness of the hero of
Dumas' drivelling dramatic demon, De
Birac. Mr. Coghlan has one capital quality:
he is picturesque in the presence of crime.
Mr. Smedley s part was one of the best-
played in the piece. Mr. C. W. Somerset,
as the red-haired Bushranger, is delight-
fully comic. The "tag," consists in his
shooting something outside.
In Not Intimet (" Peril") you remember
that a "harmless necessary" Hare—no
offence to the St. James's—is slain to make
a conclusion. Here the victim is only a wan-
dering lover.
"Pop! Bang! "Whose bird?" That's
the French notion of a tag, as the husband
looses off "into the brown" of his wife's
adorers.
As it stands this is an ugly play, crudely
translated, with its questionable vitality
vivisected out of it; and it is played by some
clever professionals, assisted at intervals by
a really pretty well-dressed personage, who
thus far, at all events, must still be known
as " the Beautiful Amateur."

THE WHITE HORBOB; OE, THE HAUNTED CABINET.
A tremendous hurricane rattled at the casements, and shook the
foundations of a lonely mansion in Downing Street. Far away
might be heard the sepulchral cries of vendors selling the earliest
possible editions of the evening papers. Cowering over the flickering
embers of a fading tire, sat two men who had long passed middle
life. Ever and anon each of them would glance over his shoulder,
and then try to look as if he had not done so. The moaning of the
tempest, the shaking of the arras, appeared to fill them with super-
natural horror.
"Hast ever seen such a sprite, my Lord P " whispered the younger
of the twain, whose thoughtful brow was harried with emotion.
"Nay, in mine early day they may have walked, hut the ancient
Pam heeded them not. Now, their coming bodeth nothing but evil,
evil, evil!" And he wrung his hands till they pealea like the
passing bell!
"Job saith he helieveth in them not, and I have heard Charles
question their existence," remarked the younger.
"Joseph hath his own Red Spectre for a familiar." replied the
elder sage, " and Charles, in his heart, is one of the Sadduoees
whom men call Jingoes."
"Ah, William of Germany, the Kaiser, dreadeth not the White
Lady, the Spectre of his house, as we dread this White"
"Hush, my Lord of Derby, name it not!" moaned the elder man.
"Speak of the "here he paused.
A Foreign Office Clerk, pale with terror, fell into, rather than
entered the chamber. "I nave seen it!" he yelled.
The two Watchers were invisible in a moment. One of them had
concealed his lordly form under the table, the other had buried his
noble head in the coal-scuttle.
The new-comer closed the door, poked the fire, and lit the candles.
Presently those on whom he had intruded emerged from their
places of retreat.
"Hast thou indeed beheld the White , the Terror of the
Cabinet? Hast thou seen the Horror of the Foreign Offioe?"
"I have, and do yet live," said the subaltern, trembling.
"Then it hath emerged P"—" Yea. my Lord, it is out f"
"Now, my Lord of Granville," said the younger of the two
Watchers, "let us brave it like men. Come to the Cabinet!"
With trembling footsteps he and his companions fared towards
the Secret Chamber. At the door they paused.
"The Curse of our Administration hath come upon us," whispered
the elder Watoher. "What saith the ancient prophecy P—
"When the White Book meeteth the Book of Blue,
Then shall the Gladstone Cabinet rue!"
The younger Watcher moaned, and unbarred the portals of the
Haunted Chamber. "One we can face," he muttered. "The public
is familiar with the Angra Pequena business already, and oonsidereth
Angra Pequena to be a new sort of Patent Bitters.
He entered. A wan, white glare, as it were, of corpse candles, on
the Brash system of Electric Lighting, streamed from within.
"Ah, woe! ah, woe! There are three.'" screamed the Watcher, for,
in the dismal silence of that mystic cell were visible the spectral forms
of Three White Books!
"Angra Pequena," murmured the more aged of the Statesmen.
"Fiji, alas! Fiji!" burst from the blanched lips of his companion.
"New Guinea f" screamed both at once.
Alone, for their minion had fled, alone while the hail scourging
the casement-windows, the Chiefs of the British Foreign and Colonial
Office stood, trembling and unmanned, in the accusing presence of
the Three White Books!
Then spirit-voices whispered like the wind, they murmured in the
lurid twilight, and such ominous sounds were heard as "Inter-
national Guarantee." "Neutralisation of Canal," "Representation
on the Caisse," and last uprose and conquered the long-laid but resur-
gent spectre of The Dual Control! The rest was silence, and Scuttling.
A Real Reform.
Assaults on Property, Bull will not stand,
But to Monopolist Companies gives no quarter;
Though he objects to Nationalise the Land,
He'd very gladly Nationalise the Water!
Some determined Conservatives in the neighbourhood of the House
last Saturday at first thonght that, what turned out to be an attempt
of dastardly dynamiters, was some new scheme of Mr. Gladstone's
for the Redistribution of Seats.

Q. As an influential daily paper, in a recent extremely sensible

to any Continental Power, and it is also notorious that the causes of
our inferiority are dependent upon a system of supply which con-
tinues in active operation." Will you be so good as to tell me
whether this is really the case; and if so, how it may be accounted
for?
A. This is really the case; and it may be accounted for as follows.
"Our firearms of every description, from rifles to cannon of the largest
calibre," are supplied to us on a system of sportive jobbery for the
purpose of serving the interest and feeding the amour propre of a
few privileged but most unimportant permanent officials.
Q. That is so. You are referring, I presume, to that extremely
curious and comic military Corporation, styled, with a good deal of
quiet satire, the " Ordnance Department" P
A. I am.
Q. Then can you tell me some of the funny and peculiar freaks
practised by this same most humorous and mirth-provoking Cor-
poration?
A. I can. The first objeot of this quite killing body being not to
provide the country with proper and effective defensive weapons, but
merely to take care that, whatever may be the demand, there shall
be no lay competition to meet the supply, it comes about that what
with their want of decent patriotism, lack of scientific intelligence and
absence of common sense, the British Soldier is sent to fight his
battles with the worst rifle in Europe, while the British sailor is
never quite sure till he has fired his gun whether it is destined to
work devastation in the hull of an enemy, or blow up light-heartedly
but bodily between the decks of his own ship.
Q. Quite so. And will yon now tell me the one and only thing
that by their perfect and expensive scientific machinery these
hilarious Ordnance officials effectually manage to rifle P
A. I will. The pocket of the British Tax-payer.
Q. Yet I presume that, in time of war, should any national
disaster ensue, it might be viewed in a rather more awkward light P
A. Undoubtedly.
Q. And now, tell me, were the country, through the broadly
humorous conduct of these same irrepressible permanent officials, to
be brought to the verge of ruin, what do you consider, judging from
historic precedent, would be the reasonable attitude of the British
Tax-payer P
A. He would insist on their being beheaded on Tower Hill.
THE BUTLERS OF GREAT MEN.
{Interviewed by Our Own Special Back-Stairs Representative.)
No. I.—At Mb. J. L. T--lb's.
I passed as quickly as I could, and I think fairly unobserved,
down the area-railings, and soon found myself, after a little prelimi-
nary altercation at the kitchen-door, comfortably seated in an ample
Windsor ohair in the pantry. It was not a particularly spacious
apartment, but yet just what such a room should be; giving the
Butler space to stroll about goodhumouredly, as, leisurely discoursing,
he revealed to me, one by one, with easy aplomb, the domestio secrets
and peculiarities of his distinguished Master's private life.
_" Does the Boss go to bed late?" "He does," was his laconio but
vivacious reply to an inquiry on my part as to whether it was true, as
I had heard, that that great Comedian sat up far into the small hours
of the morning, eating hot gruel mixed with caviare, and reading
Lucretius with a translation. "Yes, he does, but it isn't for
nothing of that, Sir," he continued, thoughtfully. "No, his princi-
pal game is quite of another kind—Astronomy." And noticing my
look of interested surprise, he added, "Yes, it's a fact; and I don t
suppose there's an Astronomer,—I don't care who he is,—between
this and Greenwich Hospital as is prouder of his seven-foot telescope
than the Governor. It's on the top of the roof, all clean and polished
as a new pin. But he won't touch it himself without putting on a pair
of large white Berlin-wool gloves, 'to keep off the smuts,' as he says
to me, and give a bit of an extra shine to the big glass at the top
when there s been a kitchen-chimney on fire next door, and a Brigade-
engine or two has been playing a little too free all over the joints.
Does he mind that?—Not he. What does make him angry
though is—fog. 'Billinq8,' he'll say to me, when you oan't see
your hand two foot off, 'that fog does make me so wild. It spoils
the sky, don't you know, that's what it does; and between you and
me, I don't believe your real stuck-up Observatory cove, who has his
Whitaker by heart, is a bit better off for all his swagger about the
Great Bear climbing up the North Pole, and Jupiter putting on
Orion's Belt, and finding it tight, and all that. No—put your
bloated Astronomer in a fog, and where is heP That's what I
want to know,— Where ishef"
"Does the Governor pass his time in other recreations P"
"Rather I I don't think anybody is about just now, and I '11 show
you," and as he says this, my communicative guide leads me up-
Btairs into a large, but finely-modelled empty room, and indicates a
rostrum at the other end. "There," he says, that's where he orates
all to himself. He's very proud of his speeches, and frequently when
there's a good deal of fog on outside, you'11 hear him a holloaing on
in here up to five and six in the morning; and sometimes when
there's a public dinner, or such like event a ' looming,' as he says,
before him, I've know him only turn-in with the milk."
"What door is that.P—Why. that's where he keeps his blood-
hounds—six of them, and I don t suppose there's six finer or more
savage beasts of the breed to be found this side of the Serpentine.
Do they know him ?—Well,—almost.
"* Bilxings,' he says to me the other day, ' I like those dogs, you
know, and always had a taste for them. But I wish they would
understand that I'm not a burglar inside my own house.' But he's
taming them nicely now. Only last week he put the whole lot of
'em on the free list in King William Street."
We were now in the Hall. I was at once struck by the colossal
church-organ worked by a powerful dynamo that completely blocked
one half of it, and rendered any attempt (to reach the front door a
matter of some difficulty. "Ah, most people have a good stare at
that," he said, in answer to my rather wondering look of inquiry.
"You wouldn't think it now, but the Governor is tremendous fond
of Sacred Music I've seen him sit there for hours together with all
the stops out playing the Two Obadiahs with one finger."
But here a barouche and six horses drove up suddenly to the front
door. A thundering double knock followed.
"It's him 1" said the Butler, quickly. "Look sharp! Scarce is
the word!" and as the distinguished owner entered his conveniently
appointed mansion, I crept up the area-steps and turned to the Park
with the conviction that I had passed a most enjoyable and inter-
esting half-hour upon his premises.

PUBLIC GEIEVANCES.
(By Our Own Inspector.)
No. Iir.—Advertisements.
Tiie experience that I am so rapidly gaining in regard to Public
Grievances induces me to believe that few are more universally
detested by the educated classes of Society than Advertisements.
The special complaint seems to be, that there is no escaping from
them, that they meet ns at every turn, at every corner, and in the
most unexpected places, that they cause a terrible amount of bad
language to be uttered, and have become an abomination, a nuisance,
and a grievance. I append a small selection of extracts as samples
of the many complaints I have received.
Sib,—I am generally considered by my numerous friends to be a
man of calm and even philosophical temperament, but I do confess
that the modern curse of advertising has so utterly and irretrievably
spoiled my enjoyment of most things in which I formerly took
delight, that I am rapidly becoming irritable, cross, and sometimes
even offensive. Sir, I have, as I believe, a fine taste for Art, but I
cannot take my usual walks abroad without having forced upon my
attention, from every abominable hoarding I pass, such hideous and
amazing scenes of horror as make my blood curdle with disgust.
What possible good can the idiots who pay for these things hope to
get from their exhibition? I might have been tempted, perhaps,
occasionally to visit one of the theatres where the plays are acted,
scenes from whioh are thus displayed, had I been allowed to remain
in ignorance of what I was to see, but, having no particular taste for
actual representation of the loathsome horrors that are thus pub-
licly displayed in our streets, I avoid them as I would the plague.
My light reading, too, is all spoilt by the same obtrusive rubbish,
and if I knew some favoured spot where advertisements are care-
fully eliminated in every shape and form, I would at onoe seek it, in
hopes of finding there that calm and tranquil existence I fail to
obtain here. A Bored Londoner.
Sib,—I am an invalid, and I don't mind confessing to you, in the
very strictest confidence, that I thoroughly enjoy my invalid
existence. I am the object of the profoundest sympathy to all ray
numerous friends, and my dear good husband, who perfectly idolises
me, is never so happy as when he has discovered some new means of
increasing my comfort. But really, when seated in my comfortable
reclining chair, with some half-dozen of the very newest novels,
English and French, within my reach, wrapped up in my beautiful
Indian shawl, a little something nice to sip, not coffee, on the
adjacent ooffee-table, with Jeannette within call, and the dear
Dootor coming three or four times a week to bring me all the very
latest gossip about our particular set, knowing that my devoted
husband has gone for a day's hunting, or a day's fishing, or a day's
shooting, as the case may be, I do honestly confess that I envy no
woman, but really and truly enjoy my life, though I am considered,
and, I have no doubt, sympathisingly spoken of as the poor invalid.
But, like most people, I suppose, I have my special grievance.
I am favoured with a large circle of acquaintances, all, like my-
self, well to do, so they never bore me with troublesome matters,
from which, too, my reputation as a sad invalid would of course
protect me. But it is their mistaken kindness of which I have to
complain. Whenever any miserable mountebank invents some
nauseous mess that is to cure all the ills that mere common flesh is
heir to, of course, following the awful custom that has become so
common, he advertises it in every possible way, and adds to its name
a list of all the loathsome diseases that it is especially intended for.
with descriptions of various horrible cases, with all their awful
details, that are said to have been cured by its means.
Would any of my sister invalids who pass their luxurious lives as
I do, that is, in the enjoyment of everything that a true lady holds
dear, such as perfect quiet, perfect repose, perfect enjoyment, and
perfect freedom from all bother and worry and anxiety, really
believe, that my much mistaken and awfully cruel friends actually
out out these dreadful advertisements and send them to me as appli-
cable to my case! My case ! why my case requires no cure. I don't
want to be cured. I see a little and near a great deal of what goes on

Hunting Man. "Comb on!"
PROBABLE.
Cockney Friend (on Screw). "' Come on 1! Oh, tbs !' Comb off," you mean
around me, and I don't know one of my married friends with whom
I would change, for, what is called good health seems to bring: with
it such fearful responsibilities that I shudder at the bare thought of
haying to assume them. No, Sir, there is but one dark cloud in ray
otherwise bright sky, and that is the grievance that I trust you will
be enabled to greatly diminish, if not altogether abolish. L. L.
Sir,—I am an unmarried man, what the vulgar call a Bachelor,
and I hate, loathe, and detest anything that bores me. I pay my
rates and taxes like a man, and expect in return to be freed from all
grievances. My especial grievance is advertising. It is the daily
plague of my otherwise very endurable existence. There are a
certain number of lunatics, with far more money than brains, who
are always boring me to buy goods that I don't want. It is no use
for me to 'say that I don't, for instance, want any Apple-scented
Soap,—as I detest soap scented with fruit,—or Tbeloar's Seamless
Socks, or Lowlamp's Prophetio Sal twine, or Bitter Hops, as I am not
a Brewer. All in vain, the same detestable names meet me at every
turn, dodge me at every corner, stare at me from every magazine, or
newspaper, or omnibus, informing me too that Mdme. Patti and
Mrs. Langtbt, and all the rest of the tribe, have found something
very good for the complexion. "What care I about their complexions?
I have always understood that theatrical complexions are made to
order, and when I go to see or hear these advertising Ladies sing or
act, I pay to hear them sing or act, and not to gaze idiotically at
their complexions.
And then too how shamefully I am swindled sometimes. I read,
for instance, a most pathetic account of some sad incident in humble
life, that actually almost brings tears to my old eyes, albeit unused
to the melting mood, and find at the close that it is only an artful
advertisement of Enoch's Salt Fruit, or some such patent medi-
cine. Believe me, Sir, from this daily infliction, and name your own
reward. T t>
The Albany. A" a-
Sib,—Finding the desire to escape from this real grievance so
universal, I have conceived the idea of establishing an "Anti-
Advertisement Association," to which I will aot as Secretary, with a
reasonable salary, of course. Every member on joining will pledge
himself never to visit a Theatre the Manager of which placards the
streets with illustrated advertisements. Never to wash with adver-
tised Soaps. Never to wear advertised Braces. Never to drink
advertised Drinks. Never to take advertised Medicines. Never to
advertised Clothes. Never to furnish with advertised Furni-
ture, and never, oh never, under any possible or conceivable
circumstances, to drink advertised Wines.
After giving my whole mind to the subject for a whole week, I
arrive at the conclusion, that there are, of the four million inhabi-
tants of the Metropolis, only just about two hundred and fifty
thousand to whom these various obtrusive and offensive advertise-
ments are addressed. If therefore some two-thirds of this number,
or say, one hundred and fifty thousand, were to join my Association,
at the trifling subscription of one guinea per annum, I would
guarantee that this annoying grievance should be stamped out just
after the second yearly subscription should have become due.
Perhaps, Sir, you will allow intending Members to send their first
year's subscription to your office. Yours,
Digby Gband.

'ARRY ON 'ONESTY.
Dear Charlie,
'Ow are yer, old hoyster? For me, I'm. a. gitting on prime.
Fact is, though I say it as shouldn't, I'm one of the stars of the time.
The world's coming round to my views, Charlie, fast, there's no kid about that.
They 're in everyone'» mouth,—ony J puts 'em rather more spicy and pat.
I'm a sort of hapos'tle, they tell me, of snideness and taste for wot's wot,
Of houtspoken up and down bizness, and 'atred for tame tommy-rot.
Well, I don't wear a blanket, my biffin, and mightn't look well cut in stone.
But for sound common sense and straight talk I'm a fair top-row sarmple, I
own.
Jest look at the Stage, Charlie! Bless yer, the thin water-gruelly stuff
Wot's bin talked about that in the past always give me the 'ump and the 'uff.
But they 're droppin' it, Charlie, they 're droppin' it, like other moral 'ot taters.
Won't go, any more than a ballet-gal's legs in a bishop's black gaiters.
I always did say wot one wants at the Play is fair yum-yum and larks,
And now 'ere's the horaoles tipping their ditto to 'Aret s remarks.
The 'igh-flying criokits may splutter, the sleek soapboard crawlers may sniff,
But gumptioners know that wot pays is the pink and the spicily spiff.
I mayn't be a Masher exaokly, leastways wot the publio so oalls,
'Cos it won't always ran to claw 'ammers, white kites, and front rows in the
Stalls.
But I know 'em, and, tip me the ochre, I'd take a fair hand in their game,
For as fur as I see in our notions and tastes we're percisely the same.
Wot's all this yer chat about Beauty that Artists and Parsons pay out?
If a chap ain't to get a fair eye on it when a neat paroel's about,
Your Beauty's a bloomin' old fraud. It is when it's on show, my dear boy,
That it's worth anythink to a bloke as is blest with the taste to eDjoy.
Well, the Stage is a Beauty-Shop, Charlie, that's wropping it up nice and
small,
And I wants as much for my tin as the Chambebling'b game for, that's all.
If Pootiness trots 'erself out for my taste, it pays her I '11 be bound,
And her Showman, he takes his gate-money, and so we are 'appy all round.
Not moral, sing out the old Mivvies! Lor, Charlie, wot 'umbug it is!
If we 're all in the swim, free and willing, and all find it jolly god biz,
Who the dooae has the right to complain? 'Tisn't morals that's wanted,
old pal,
But cleverness, whether in Manager, Masher, or pooty-limbed gal.
"Wide oh!" is the word in this world, Charlie. Beauty must prance it
for pelf,
And as to the risk, that's 'er bizness—Bhe's got to look out for 'erself.
Theayters ain't Sunday Schools, are they P nor Managers Matrons and Nusses,
And Pink Parades ain't to be spoiled by the fads of the frumps and the fusses.
She knows her own book, 8ir, does Beauty, and don't want no texts out o'
your'n.
You tip her a track, and jest try it—she'd cut such a Juggins with scorn I
If me and the Masher wants cheek and oarnation, and she's on the job,
Why shouldn't her Stage Trotter-out take his perks too at so much a nob P
It '■ Free Trade—in Beauty, my biffin, demand and supply and all that.
You know what you go to the shop for, and get it, that's puttin' it pat.
Let's be 'onest, old pal, I love 'onesty all round my 'at, and no kid.
I could pitoh you a yarn on that text; but I fear I must put on the skid.
Call a shovel a shovel's my motter. Some say I'm a oyniole cad;
Wot's " oyniole," Charlie? Jest 'onest; plain faok without painting or pad,
Pop out the straight truth with a grin, and. they dubs you a Satter or Turk;
You should wrop it up nice in white sugar, and 'and it about with a smirk.
If I worked the theatrical fake—which I don't, my dear Charlie, wus luck!—
I shouldn't go snouting of morals, pure art, and such mollyslop muck.
Not me, Sir! Pink saucer and spangle and spice would be my little lay,
And I'd own I a Beauty-Shop kept, and I rather meant making it pay.
My sentiments, mate, and I'm 'appy to find they are spreading a bit;
In faot, that my notions of Life are decidedly making a 'it.
Yu-U;up! Foller yer leader, you Mashers and Managers, all who can carry
Sufficient sky-sorapers to keep in the 'unt, with that 'igh-flyer 'Aret.

It is reported that, as an ocean-poacher on neighbouring preserves, a

the smack was not; and let us hope that nobody concerned with her has had

M. DUMAS' LAST.
[Telegram from our Correspondent.]
Paris, Monday Night.
"Denise," the new Comedy by Alexandre Ddmas,
was brought out to-night for the first time at the Comedie
Franchise. It is needless to say that all the most dis-
tinguished people in Paris were present, and those who
could not secure standing-room in the Gallery or " Foyer,"
were perfeotly content with waiting in the street outside
the Theatre. It was pleasant to Bee the number of Ladies
who had assembled to listen to the innocent drolleries
of this celebrated comic writer. The only fault that I
can find with the play, now that I have got home at one
o'clock in the morning, and am trying to recollect the
plot over a tumblerful of eau de vie, is that it is just a
little _ too goody-goody, too milk-and-watery, to suit
Parisian taste.
In the first place, let us give the talented author the
credit that is undoubtedly his due. He has preserved
the Unities of Time and Place in the most masterly
manner. Thus the tchole action of the piece takes place
in one room! There is, also, no more time supposed to
be taken in the action than is required for the actual
performance—i.e., three-and-a-half hours! This in
itself is a triumph of Art. If your readers don't at
once see the tremendous advantage of it, I am afraid I
can't make it clear to them. It is true that, in order to
secure this result, a great deal which might otherwise be
explained by action has to be placed before the audience
by means of lengthy and tedious dialogues. But what
of that? As a matter of faot, the play consists of a
series of witty dialogues, crammed with point, and of
infinite suggestiveness. M. Dumas's theory seems to
be, that there's nothing in the world so exciting as a
good long conversation. His Comedy is a succession of
chats on the Stage. If the play is wrecked, it wiU not
be because it is water-logged, but because it is dialogued.
I have told you that the drama is a trifle goody-goody,
and so it is in French eyes, though perhaps not in
English. It is difficult to explain to English readers
what the plot of the play really is. While, as I have
mentioned, the_ Unities are strictly preserved, the Pro-
prieties are strictly neglected. An enterprising lessee on
your side of the Channel who had the temerity to pro-
duce such a piece would be pelted with rotten eggs.
You will, therefore, agree with me in deprecating the
precipitancy of the censure which an eminent "lit-
terateur" expressed to me with regard to the play half-
an-hour ago—namely, that it is "offensively moral."
As I said before, I really don't think I can give you
even an outline of the plot, although it seemed to afford
muoh gratification to the Gentlemen and LadieB who
listened to it to-night. I regret that such insular pre-
judices still exist, but I am quite sure that with yon the
whole thing would be regarded as totally unfit for pub-
lication. Still, I must at least afford you some notion of
who the chief personages are.
The heroine, excellently played by Mdlle. Babtet, is
a girl who, though young in years, seems to have seen
a good deal of life. She lives in the country-house of
Count Andre de Bardannes, as companion to his sister,
Marthe, and so do her parents, who manage the Count's
house for him. An elderly widow, Madame de Thauzette,
ii on a visit to the house, and so is her son, Fernanda
Of the relations existing between these different charac-
ters, the less said the better. The intrigues are a trifle
mixed all round. The play closes in this highly inge-
nious manner:—Madame de Thauzette, who has been the
Count's mistress, allows her son Fernand to propose to
the Count's sister, and Denise, who has been the mistress
of Madame de Thauzette1 s son, marries the Count, who
has been the lover of Madame de Thauzette herself. The
moral of the play seems to be,—" If I elope with my
aunt's grandmamma, what relation will my niece's lover
be to my wife's illegitimate step-son P" This conun-
drum seemed to give muoh satisfaction, and the Curtain
fell on a scene of great enthusiasm. I can't add more,
as time's up for your Special Parisian wire; but I very
muoh fear that a surfeit of morality will be the death
of this last venture of the versatile M. Dumas.

Mr. Chamberlain's significant reference to the evidently already
projected Bill for the payment of Members of Parliament, has, as
might have been conceived, produced a tremendous sensation among
the beggarly Solicitors, witless Barristers, superannuated Clerks,
and the general ruck of high-aouled but impecunious people among
whom it is evident that the earnest politicians of the future will
inevitably have to be found. Several rumours are afloat as to the
leading features of the measure, but the following, though merely
preliminary, may be regarded as substantially correct:—
1. £250 per annum (payable quarterly in advance).
2. Free (outside) transit on any omnibus going to or from West-
minster Bridge.
3. The right of entrance without charge to Messrs. Gatti's
Restaurant, the Duke of York's Column, the pit of Her Majesty's
Theatre, and the reserved seats during feeding-time at the Regent's
Park Zoological Gardens.
4. A New Suit of Ready-made Clothes, of stout and serviceable
quality, annually, and free of cost, at the commencement of the
Summer Session.
5. The gratis hire, three times a year, of a White Tie, Pair of
Evening Shoes, and Tail Coat, on the three separate occasions, re-
spectively, of attendance at the Speaker's Levy, Invitation to the
Shilling Ministerial White Bait Dinner, and possible appearance in
the capacity of Honorary Waiters at a Garden Party at Marlborough
House.
6. An Extra Donation of £5, in the shape of a Christmas Box, for
the purpose of Subscribing fittingly to the various Local, County, or
Borough Charities.

OUR NOT-QUITE-AT-HOME SECRETARY.
Ms. Punch, Sir,
What a grand thing it must be to be a Heaven-born Minister!
Though, perhaps, after all, it may be just as grand a thing to fanoy
yourself one, and so be able to treat with supercilious contempt any
audacious body of men, such as Corporations and such small fry,
who dare to make a mere oommon-sense suggestion for meeting a
great and alarming difficulty. Besides it so simplifies matters. All
the Heaven-born Minister has to do, is to sit quietly in his com-
fortable office, when some great calamity occurs, and do—nothing,
and when any rash man, or body of men, propose to do something,
all he has to do is to lecture them on their presumption in the fashion
of " I am Sir Oracle, and when I ope my lips let no dog bark!"
I am led, Sir, into this train of thought by what has occurred
lately in the Metropolis. About a month ago an attempt was made, as
we all know, on a Saturday afternoon, to blow up with dynamite an
aroh of London Bridge, just at the time when the Bridge is certain to
be most crowded with men, women, and children. Fortunately, by the
merest chance, the awfully wicked attempt failed, or such a soene of
fearful suffering would have ensued as perhaps never has been wit-
nessed in a peaceful city. The Corporation of the City of London,
who are the trustees of the Bridge, offered a reward of £5,000 for
the apprehension and conviction of the miscreants who had planned
and attempted to carry out this fiendish soheme, and actually had
the audacity to request the high and mighty Minister who conde-
scends to take the Metropolis under his protecting care, to supplement
their liberal reward by the customary offer of a free pardon to any
accomplice of these bloodthirsty ruffians whom conscience, or fear, or
money might tempt to betray them.
But they were soon taught what sort of Minister they had to deal
with. After being kept in an anxious state of suspense for about a
fortnight, till the great man could find abundant leisure for the con-
sideration of so small a matter, they received an epistle, occupying
some twelve sheets of foolscap, severely censuring them for daring
to make any suggestion to him upon a subject to which he had given
his whole 'mighty intellect, and the result of such profound con-
sideration would probably shortly appear. This fact, fortunately,
Ests wind, and not only the Corporation, but the Press, the men of
ight and Leading, and the great mass of the Metropolitan public,
on the great Minister's plan " suspended wait."
What occurs P In less than three weeks from the day this now
celebrated do-nothing epistle was made public, on another Saturday
afternoon, when large numbers of people are gazing with admiration
on the great historical edifices of the Tower of London and West-
minster Hall, and the always-interesting House of Commons, three
more awfully wicked attempts are made, they again fail by the
merest chance, the same do-nothing prinoiple that failed so miserably
before is again adopted, and the Heaven-born Minister walks calmly
among the dibrit of the beautiful ceiling of Westminster Hall, and
talks philosophically of walking on "the dust of ages 1" What his
feelings were when he visited the bed-sides of the two poor policemen
whose marvellous courage prevented the outrage becoming a cata-
strophe, it would be impertinent to inquire or to imagine. But we
have a clear right to demand how many more of these desperately
wicked attempts are yet to be made, before this proud and imperious
Minister oondescends to inform us what means he proposes adopting
for our protection, in addition to lecturing those who were quite
ready, if allowed, to adopt means that would have made every Cab-
man, every Waiter at a Hotel, every Lodging House Keeper a
willing helper to the Police, in tracking the steps of the basest
miscreants that ever cursed the Earth. I am, Ac.,
A Citizen.

Ihe Bard knew well enough that At You Like It was not a play
at all, certainly not a good play, and so he artfully disarmed criti-
cism by an Epilogue. At You Like It, as the title implies, was
probably a risky venture intended as a superior sort of idyllic extra-
vaganza, to supersede the masques then in fashion.
As far as the management of the St. James's has gone towards
the oom piete revival, everything in the matter of costume and scenery
has been magnificently done, in fact overdone,
i As for the two Dukes at the St. James's, they are so true to nature.

—which of course they would be at the St. James's, where, if any-
where, they do know what a real live Duke is like,—that we only
wonder our Hereditary Legislators have not been banished long ago.
But then these, it must be remembered, are Foreign Dukes,—the
exiled one being a "Pretender,"—and so perhaps the St. James' ■
Management may not be quite so familiar with this type, as it would
be with members of our own aristooraoy. Hence it is that the
Usurping Duke Frederick, is a blustering, lolloping, restless sort of
under-bred person, the uneasy state of
whose conscience is expressed by the
hurried manner in which he makes his
exits, as though he were perpetually
hearing the dread whisper, Here's a
policeman coming 1" As for the Exiled
Duke, he might be oorreotly described
as the Banished Cheesemonger, so stolid
and unobtrusive is the bearing of this
Nobleman in reduced circumstances.
How he and his followers managed to
preserve their beautiful dresses,—for
they are more splendidly attired than
the other Duke and his people,—while
going about in the forest, hunting stags,
and lying on mossy banks, is as wonder-
ful as their almost miraculous freedom
from rheumatism and horrid bad colds,
from which ordinary mortals similarly
situated wuuld not be exempt.
The only interest that can be aroused
for Orlando, apart from the sympathy
which his ineffectual attempts to shake
off the Old Adam must reoeive at
everybody's hands, is in his being a
stripling, and physically unable to oope
with Charlet the Wrestler. Such a
comparison as exists between Mr. Pen
let and Mr. Hill is absolutely necessary
in these two characters. By the way, Penley for Orlando, strug-
gling in the arms of Hill as Charlet the Wrestler, and upsetting
him in the contest, is a suggestion worth consideration in any future
revival. How admirably Mr. Kendal fulfils this essential condition
and how like a youthful stripling he is. may be imagined by those
who are familiar with his appearance in The Ironmaster, in Impulse,
in The Queen't Shilling, The Squire, and so forth.
The part of that sportive, mock-modest "Young Person,"
Rntalind, falls, of course, to Mrs. Kendal, in whose hands not a
tailing point is lost. She is least good in the First Act, and best in
tha two last. Grant for romantic and poetic purposes the idea of a |

girl disguised as a boy, calling himself Oanymede, proposing that
love should be made to him by a young man, and whose conversation
(her friend Celia is rather worse in this respect) is of such a nature
as to require most careful editing at the
hands of a Nineteenth-Century Mana-
ger, it must be owned that an Actress
has to perform a part which, written in a
coarse age to be played by a boy, requires
most delicate treatment to prevent its
being offensive. Of course the Rotalind
of Mrs. Kendal is the pieoe; it is all
Rotalind. After her—nobody and no-
thing. "As you like her," so you like
"«'«." As 'Abut would say, "It is 'er
as makes the 'it."
Nowadays, when its coarseness is
eliminated or toned down, or when what
is left of it is unintelligible to the
majority, the part of Touchttone is
simply a very bad one, and can only be
made telling by a very popular Low
Comedian, whose absurd peculiarities
are a part of himself, as was the case
with the late Mr. Bcckstone. We have
seen Bucxstone as Touchttone: we
have seen Mr. Compton. We laughed
at each, not because he was playing
Touchttone, but because it was Buck-
stone or Compton. Mr. Hare was so
intensely nervous on the first night that
he rather aroused sympathetic pity than
afforded any amusement; but, as some
critics in prophetic mood went so far as to praise him for what he is
going to do, we own that we shall be most agreeably disappointed if
he is ever able to make anything of it at all,—which we believe he
cannot do even by developing the sort of Whitechapel walk-round,
which reminded us of Mr. David
James's ohick-a-leary step after
singing "The Ugly Donkey Cart,"
in a Strand burlesque.
Shakspeare, in this piece, has put
all the best speeohes by which the
play is remembered into the mouths of
subordinate characters. Old Adam,
Jaquet, the First Lord, the Exiled
Duke, even wicked Oliver, have the
best thin gs to say and very little to do.
And why on earth couldn't they
leave the music alone? Mr. Cullers
compositions (except one, which is of
an inferior Offenbachian order) are
pretty and musioianly enough, and
would be in their place at a Concert
as an interesting experiment, but in
the piece itself they are a mistake.
The andienoe want to hear the old
familiar tunes, and they so resented
their absence on the first night aa to
give an extra welcome to their old
friend in the tune of "The Cuckoo," which Mrs. Kendal sang as if
she had been Jenny Lind instead of Rota Lind, and had she but
added a dance afterwards, there are not a few of her professional
sisters who play in burlesque but would have trembled for their
laurels, in case she should take it into her head to return to this line
of business, to which we believe she bade farewell for ever in the
revival of a certain Classical Extravaganza, called Ixion, at the
Haymarket.
Our receipt for keeping the pieoe in the bills is this:—Cut down
Touchttone, and give it to Mr. Paulton; let Miss Pull lips (who
was in the company, and is now for aught I know) play Audrey:
cart away, D'Oyly Carte away, all Mr. Celliek's vocal music,
retaining the instrumental "melodrames" as suitable to the
extravaganza, and finish with a sprightly danoe, written by Herr
Meteb Lutz or M. J a com, either of whom thoroughly understands

Playing the Fool; or, Hare and
the sort of thing required to give the pieoe a lift, add a good tableau
lit up with sixpenn orth of red fire, and the chances of a long ran
maybe considerably improved.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LETTERS IN THE RECESS.
By Eminent Hands.
V.—ON "GO."
Dbab Tobt.
It will probably occur to yon that I am the last person in
the world to discuss the question of " Go." I have, as everybody
knows, since they have no opportunity to forget, puhlioly confessed
myself lacking in " Go." I may tell you that I did that in the way

of quiet jest. 1 often make little jokes of that kind, and am some-
times surprised at the reception they meet with. It was a sly hit
at some of my friends and colleagues; but people have taken it
literally, and there it will always stand.
That I am not lacking in " Go" of a proper kind was, I venture to
think, abundantly shown during my recent trip to Devonshire. When
I started on the campaign, I was, I own, a little depressed to find
the name of the Gentleman deputed to personally conduct me was
Prsx-Coirnr. There is a grim preoiseness about the name that
made me shudder. It seemed that not only were our hopes predes-
tined to early death, but that arrangements had already been made
to bury them. However, that was a mere fancy, which I soon got
over. There were some people at our meetings who had been
present during the Premier's last visit to Midlothian, and who
declared that in respect of the crowd that came to see me, and of
the maimer in which I moved that crowd, Gladstone was not in
it. Day and night I kept it up, and though the newspapers would
have it that I said nothing fresh, and they always say that, I for
one have come to disregard the dictum.
But there is Go and Go—or, if you would like it in the original,
II y a aUet tt allez. According to some practitioners, " Go " consists
of flouting your elders and betters, saying all kinds of impertinent,
insolent, and inaccurate things, and never, under any conditions,
withdrawing an imputation or accusation proved to be groundless.
"Go," in this sense, is chiefly made up of the habit of "cheeking"
your elders, the more venerable and the more respected, the more
creditable, or at least the more successful, the effort. I do not dis-
guise the fact that I have myself personally suffered from ebullitions
of the spirit here faintly indicated. I have borne it with a meekness
which has, perhaps, had the effect of encouraging further displays,
I have generally in such bouts played the part, or rather presented
the appearance, of the vanquished. But I declare that I would not
change places with the nominal victor.
There is another kind of " Go," less reprehensible from a political
point of view, because'it is better balanced in its operation. Adepts
of the first class do not mind whom they hurt, whether friend or foe.
Of the second class the attack and misrepresentation are limited to
the disadvantage of the enemy. You will know well enough that
there are times and seasons in politics when it is impossible to be
lively. Things are dull generally, or the position of your own Party
is such that the least said the better. At such crises I, in accordance
with old-fashioned habits, think the best thing to do is to remain
I.
silent. If I had " Go," I should be able to make a diversion by mis-
quoting some prominent man on the other side, or misrepresenting
his actions and intentions, and forthwith proceeding to beat him
about the head.
Very well, Tobt ; I would say at once that if this is " Go," and as
long as it continues to be regarded as "Go," I shall be content to
stand by my declaration that I am lacking in the quality. "When I
first went into politics, and for many years after, we did not do that
kind of thing. With respeot to the first kind of Go," the House of
Commons would never have tolerated it. As to the second, I
remember very well how my esteemed colleague Lord Salisbury,
even at some expense to the Conservative Party, denounced the late
Mr. Disraeli because (as he thought) his ways were not absolutely
straight, nor his statements always in precise accordance with facts.
That shows you at what a high standard public life was once held in
this country. It was, within my memory, regarded as an undisputed
axiom, that deliberately to state what is not true, to garble quota-
tions, or to misrepresent a political adversary, is equally unworthy of
a Gentleman in politics as a similar course would be pursued in
private life.
I like to dwell on these old times, but refrain lest you should think
me garrulous. I do not bring charges against anyone. I would
simply say that the ways of lite, both in the House of Commons and
on the platform, are different now from what they used to be, say,
not later than Lord Palhebston's time; and if it is " Go " that has
made the change, I shall remain content to enjoy my reputation.
To Tobt, M.P.. Yours very truly,
The Kennel, Barks. Stafford Nokthcote.
WHAT MR. PARNELL MIGHT HAVE SAID.
"There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken 'at the flood
leads on to fortune." Mr. Parnell had this great opportunity
offered to him on Monday of last week, but, strange and sad to say,
he lacked the courage and manliness to seize it, and it will probably
never occur again. On the previous Saturday no less than three of
those dastardly and cruel attempts at the indiscriminate slaughter of
hundreds of innocent men, women, and children, that make
thoughtful men sad, and the mildest of men fierce with anger, had
taken plaoe in the capital of the Empire, under circumstances of
peculiar atrocity. The day and hour selected were those when the
largest number of oasual visitors was sure to be in the Buildings
destined to destruction, and when therefore the largest number of
innocent victims would be sent to their long rest without a note of
warning, or, far worse, maimed, or blinded, or disfigured for life.
Within eight-and-forty hours of this almost inconceivably wicked
and cruel crime, Mr. Parnell, the idol of the great body of the
Irish people, the man to whom they look up for guidance and for
counsel in the struggle they are making for greater national liberty,
and who must know full well that no man can possess the enormous
influence that he possesses without also bearing a proportionately
large amount of responsibility, stands up before an enormous crowd
of his trusting fellow-countrymen, and is received by them with the
customary enthusiastic oheers; and this, we deeply regret to say, is
the speech that Mr. Parnell did hot speak:—
Fellow Countrymen I Before addressing you on the many inter-
esting matters that crowd upon my mind when I remember all that
Ireland owes to the Men of Clare, how in 1880 they set an example to
the whole country that spread like a rushing whirlwind over the rest
of Ireland, and why at this turning-point in our history it is proper
that the people of Clare should again meet together, and again vow
fealty to the cause of Ireland, I feel it incumbent upon me, as a man,
an Irishman, and a Christian, to say a few words to you upon a
matter of the deepest interest to all of us.
You have doubtless heard of what took plaoe in London last
Saturday. Attempts were made to utterly destroy three of the prin-
cipal buildings in the Metropolis at a time when they were being
visited by hundreds of visitors, mostly from the country, including
a large proportion of women and children. Anything more awful
than the scenes of massacre and agony that would, have followed the
attempts had they been successful, it is impossible to conceive. We
are told these awful crimes are committed in furtherance of the
cause of Old Ireland. I ask you, as your appointed Leader, quite
ready and willing to take my full share of every responsibility that
may attach to me when the proper time comes for action, to join with me
heart and soul, every Irishman among you, in denunciation of these
fiendish attempts, as useless, too, as they are fiendish, and to say
with me. or to let me say it for you, not only here, in this glorious
oounty, but in every plaoe in which I may find myself, whether
among good friends, as here, or among bitter foes, as elsewhere, that
Ireland needs no such dastardly help to aid her in her holy cause,
and that she refuses to enlist in her noble army of freemen, ready to
beoome her noble army of martyrs if necessary, any such company of
bloodthirsty ruffians as would disgrace any cause however great, and
ruin any enterprise however sacred!

A DREAM ABOUT DYNAMITE.
A Statesman's Dream.—In his waking hours he used sometimes
to dream of arresting the attempts of Dynamitarda to blow up
Bridges and Buildings, by the concession of Home Rule to Home
Rulers. One night, in bed. and asleep, he dreamt that he actually
had granted Ireland a separate Parliament, to legislate for Irish
affairs. There then ensued a cessation of dynamite outrages for a
time. But the Irish Parliament very soon endeavoured to take part
in Imperial legislation. This attempt was resisted by the British
Government; and then an agitation was immediately started in Ire-
land, and amongst the Irish Americans, for the complete Repeal of
the Union by the separation of Ireland, absolutely and altogether,
from the British Crown. This demand having been denied, the
Dynamitards forthwith renewed their incendiary attempts at intimi-
dation, to which our Ministers and Parliament again yielded, and
the Sister Kingdom was constituted an Irish Republic
Once more the Dynamitards suspended their atroeities, but by-and-
by England got involved in a war, and the Irish Republicans forth-
with formed an alliance with the enemy, whom they assisted with
an Irish Army and likewise an Irish Fleet, with which they had fur-
nished themselves as well as they could, and also rendered them every
other assistance except pecuniary. At the same time the dynamite
conspirators recommenced their hostilities as they had all along called
them, declaring all agencies for the destruction of life and property
fair in war. Thence the slumbering Statesman discerned that they
were no merely incensed nationalists and infuriated patriots, being,
indeed, mostly not native Irishmen, but American-Irish actuated
simply and solely as to this country, by irreconcileable hatred and
ferocious malice which no conciliation whatsoever could possibly
assuage. The Statesman awoke with an enlightened mind, and in a
bodily perspiration. As soon as he had rubbed his eyes, and begun
to reflect, it occurred to him that he had better at onoe communicate
with respectable Home Rulers, and point out to them that any dis-
position to comply with even their reasonable requests was effectually
repressed by the conviction that no suoh compliance would be of the
least avail for the purpose of diminishing the danger to be appre-
hended from continual dynamite explosions.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"THE TINY SQUARE"
At the Battle of Guhat, fought in the Desert near Metemneh, by Sir Herbert Stewart's
flying column, January 19th, 1885.
With one long deep breath of relief every breast in our England was filled.
And then to the tale: and the blood in oar veins how it tingled and thrilled!
The story, though ola, ever new, not unworthy the ears of the gods,
Of stoutness in perilous straits, and of valour defiant of odds,
We knew, yes, we knew they would tell it once more, not with speeoh but with
steel;
Yet would aught but the desert-winds hear it? That fear, which we could not
but feel,
Hung cold on our hearts, for the handful that scattered the hordes of the foes
At Abu-Klea's wells were to few, and the clutch of the waste seemed to close
Upon Stewart's small band, and we waited, as wanderers wait for the day,
For light from the shadows to cheer us, a voice frem the silence to say
How fared our few hundreds. So fared they as men sore beset by a host,
A troop by an army surrounded, a speok in the sand-stretches lost;
Death-tithed and wound-hampered and weary, unsleeping, though fainting for
sleep,
The desert-thirst parching their throats, and the desert-throngs lurking to leap
In tigerish myriads upon them. But Stewart with stoical smile
Leads on through the sand-dunes and jangles. His thousand must march for
the Nile!
The Arab-hordes hover about them, their watch-fires gleam red through the
night,
And day shows them compassed around; no escaping them! Breakfast—and
fight"
Is Stewart's oalm order, as calmly obeyed. 'Midst a murderous fire
A hasty entrenchment is raised, and then—let them have their desire,
Those blood-1 hire ty hosts on the sandhills! Give fight! ten to one though they be,
Our phalanxed eight hundred will face them. And Stewart—alas! no, not he.
The hero of hot Abu-Elea is down ere the battle is set,
Borne back from the front badly hit, with a leader's keen throb of regret
Adding pain to his wound. Now the shot of the enemy lashes like hail.
That small serried square in the desert, whioh thousands await to assail.
The Soudani horsemen and footmen hang hungry on rear and on flank,
Like wolves round the traveller's watch-fire. To stand and be mown rank on rank
Like swathes to the sickle fast falling were folly. So out on the waste
That " Tiny Square," shoulder to shoulder, tramps forth without halt without
haste.
Picture it! E'en fire-side fancy may see it, that small stealing speok,
In the wide tawny waste creeping slow, but with movement that nothing may
check
Though out from the scrub all around it the death-volleys rattle and ring,
Down, down to the valley it marches, gap'd often, yet steady of swing,
Cool dosing, and quietly wheeling, right, left, fighting silently on,
Each man passing prompt to the place whence a shot-stricken oomrade is gone.
Then massing their air-shaken banners, the swordsmen and spearmen sweep down,
Like Scamander in flood on that square they hurl fiercely, but fall, bullet-mown.
In death-rings around it, so coollv, so closely the volleys flash out,
The Dervishes' fanatie fury, the Desert-men's desperate shout
Avail not to foroe or to flurry, again, and again, and again
They rush, to be met by those muzzles, they crush, to he checked by that rain;
Till after two hours of suoh onset, two hours of suoh stubborn advance,
Down, down in one fierce final charge crash the Arabs, with sword and with
lance
All thirsty for blood, their ten thousand three sides of that still " Tiny Square"
Shook madly, but firm as a rock-range wave-lashed, it stands steadily there,
One flame all around. Can they close, can they reach it, those furious swarms
Of yelling brave AUah-invokers f E'en breasts whom the battle-glow warms
May chill at the thought. But they fall, fall in hundreds, unceasingly fall,
No man of them nears that small square, all in vain the mad Dervishes call,
And the horsemen howl fiercely in vain; although fired to rush bravely on death,
They are oheoked, these fanatical hordes, by the blast of that rhlegethon
breath,
Checked, daunted, at last, God be thanked! See they stop, see they turn, see
they fly!
And that still " Tiny Square" yet unbroken, stands safe—and the Nile-stream is
nigh.

How they cheered the "return of the Square," they who all through that
terrible night
Had waited with doubt-burdened bosoms, unknowing the end of the fight,
The war-pens may tell. But our England at home in mid-winter hot flushes
At thought of that Square in the sand-wastes; the talk of the home- circle hushes,
Whilst fancy re-pictures that moment when level in balance there hong
The fate of that dauntless eight hundred. The singers of England have sung
Of war-themes none nobler than this of brave Stewart's invincible band.
Of the hour when, alone in the desert, Old England again seemed to stand
Like a sore-wounded lion surrounded by hosts of the hunters, yet still
By the force of an unshrinking front, by the strength of unshakable will.
Stood, lived, shook the hunters' hordes off, and, unoaptured, returned to its lair.
For our soldiers a paean we lift, and we lift for brave Stewart a prayer,
But live he, or die he, his fame is assured, linked for ever
in story
With one of those heart-Btirring piotures that brighten

AN HISTORICAL PARALLEL.
Punch, Sib,
Some years ago I made a discovery concerning the Divine Williams, a discovery
which those of the New Shakspeare Society are as nothing; to the glow of which the
of those who have gone about to prove that Bacon wrote Shakspeare or Shakspeare

wrote Bacon, or neither wrote both or both wrote neither—for which I say, Sir, their lights
shall be as mere tallow-dips, and dim at that. On this disoovery, Sir, I wrote a few notes
at the time, but having prosecuted my researches to the utmost point, I feel that it is to you,
Sir—and to you alone—that I ought to communicate the result. In the first place, because
I choose to (the reason was good enough for Williams's Shyhck, and is good enough
for me); in the second place, because the question also concerns you, or you in one of
your Avatars, dealing as it does with the immortal drama known to the world as Punch
(short title, if I remember right, The Tragic History of Punch and Judy). The origin of this
great work has, as you are aware, been sought for in the mists of antiquity with indifferent
sucoess by many wise and learned persons; but it is less with its cause than with that of
which it is the oause in others, or rather in another, that the wise and learned person who
now addresses you is concerned.
However, brief let me be." We have heard a good deal, Sir, of how and where the
Divine Williams got his plots; perhaps at times we may even have beard more than enough
of it. We know all about Saxo-Grammaticus and the Italian stories, and so forth. But,
Sir, I believe I am the first who ever burst upon the discovery of where Richard the Third
came from. It came, Sir, from Punch. And my reasons, or some of them, for this assertion,
as you have not yet heard them, I will now proceed to relate to you. But as I fear that even
for so worthy a subjeot you could hardly spare me a whole number of Punch, I will touch only
upon the more striking (the word is appropriate) points.
To begin with, in the heroes of both plays we find precisely the same qualities—deformity,
light-heartedness, daring, wickedness, subtlety, masterfulness, remorselessness, and supersti-
tion. In the scenes, and in the other characters of both dramas there is astounding variety,
an artful mingling of tragedy and comedy, a lively and engaging picture of men and manners
—in short, all those characteristics which are called Shakspearian, but which, as regards this
play at least, ought evidently to be called Punchian. As for the incidents, the resemblance
is so patent that it is strange it should have been reserved for me to detect it. Punch, it
is true, opens a little more abruptly than Richard the Third. In the Shakspearian play we
find Richard in the first scene announcing his intention of becoming a husband. In Punch,
his prototype is already in the first scene a husband and a father, and his first deed in the
drama is to throw his infant out of window with reckless enjoyment, the parallel to which
performance, Richard's disposal of his nephews, comes much later in the later play.
The following incident of wife-murder is treated with greater boldness in Punch than in
Richard the Third, for Punch, instead of making any bones about his wife Judy being sick
and like to die, just takes his stick and knocks her down and there's an end on't. As for
Clarence, he must be held to correspond with the foreign gentleman who appears and disap-
pears towards the end instead of at the beginning of Punch. Williams never oared how he
inverted the incidents he took. The fordoing of the Beadle corresponds more closely in
reason and in date with that of Hastings, and in each play the deed indicates the hero's desire
to sweep all rival authority out of his way. Neighbour Brown in Punch corresponds in the
same way to Hastings in Richard the Third, and surely nothing can be clearer than that both
the character and the fate of Joey, the light-minded and frivolous scoffer, answ
the disposition, in two senses, of Buckingham in Richard the Third. As for
appearances, it leaps to the reader's eyes, as
plainly as the ghosts do to_ Punch t and
Richard's, that the incident is identical in
both dramas. The final catastrophe, it is
true, is not the same in both plays, but
then in both there is a terrific combat of
two preceding it.
And before ending this mere sketch of
my argument, I would call your attention
Sir, to one very remarkable passage in
Richard the Third, Act V., Sc. 3. "Look
that my stares be sound and not too heavy,"
says Richard, in giving directions for Ms
arming for the fight. Now. Sir, did a
warrior of that time habitually fight with
a staff? No; but Punch did, and so
Williams stuck it in, just as he made
cannon go off at King Claudius's Court, to
take one out of many parallel instances.
Isn't this convincing P If you don't think
so, you—well, you are at full liberty—yes,
actually at full liberty —to burn this
communication after (or before) you
read it.. Yours truly,
Shallabalae,

A MODERN MEMOIR.
(The Autobiography and Letters of Miss Skimley Harpole. London. Messrs. Rakings Jk Co., 1883.)
Seldom have we perused a book with bo much interest as has thrilled us during our
reading of these two handsome volumes. Situate as Miss Harpole was, the daughter of a
famous bishop, claiming for mother a lady whoso good deeds are remembered to this day,
sister of one of the most brilliant female leaders of society, and herself popular, feted, and
caressed, there is small room for wonder that even the bare details of Miss Harpole's every-
day life would prove interesting, but when told in a charmingly frank style, her book
becomes a model of what a Memoir should be. In a few short simple sentences she, with
delicious naivete", relates her home-life, and so dearly is the picture put before us that we
cannot resist quoting the fragment:—
N Abroad what were we considered P My father, one of the most popular bishops of the
"efatigable in all diocesan work; my brother inheriting his father's
oratorical and logical powers, and striving
to attain the same high position on the
Bench that his progenitor held in the
Church; my married sister, a star in the
world of fashion, yet devoted to her hus-
band and her home, and myself, so shy and
demure, a little puss, that it was well said
of me that my father should never have
been ought but a curate."
From personal knowledge, and from a
tolerably accurate recollection of the public
life of those days, this is a marvellously
true reproduction of general opinion on
the Bishop of Battersea's family; but, by
kindly hands, the veil which hung over
their private life has been raised, and in
Miss Harpoee's own words :—
"Take us at home of a night! The
Bishop in an easy chair, with his gaitered
legs crossed, and elevated on the back of
another, with a short clay pipe in his mouth,
is vaguely mixing his eleventh tumbler of
hot gin-and-water, causing us girls great
pain to conceal our titters, when, as hap-
pens very often at this period of the even-
ing, he deposits the greater part of the hot
water on the table-cloth or himself. My
mother, regardless of him, sits, carefully
studying a sporting paper, and the Racing
Calendar, and making her selections for
the next day's horse-races. For a heavy
gambler is my mother, as is _my brother,
who, when at home—which is seldom—is
either delighted at having won, or in the
sulks because he has lost money to his fel-
low legal students at billiards. As a rule
he is delighted, and always carries a lamp
of chalk in his pocket. My sister is
writing notes to Men about Town, Peers,
and Guardsmen, her lovely features only
losing their serenity when lit up by an
arch look of wonderment whether she has
made appointments with two different men
at the same hour and place, while I am
sitting, in my school-girlish way, by my-
self, making notes, to as to tell the world
some day the true storyjof my life."
No practised Author could have drawn
a more dainty description of an idyllio home
than has Miss Harpole in the above few
sentences. And it must be confessed, even
by the most nattering critio, that the Lady
is always seen to more advantage when
writing of her family than when alluding
to the affairs of State or Church, with
which, however, she was well acquainted.
Here is a pleasing recollection of her
brother:—
"I well remember Mr. Craigscourt, the
wealthy banker, dining with us one night,
and telling us, with tears in his eyes, that
his son, a mere boy with no experience, had
taken to gambling in the most reckless
manner. Could any of us, he imploringly
said, do something to save the lad P Al-
though working very hard at the time, my
brother Jimmt promised to see if he could
effect a reformation, and, sore enough, for
the next six months he never let the lad out
of his sight, at the expiration of whioh
time young Mr. Craigscourt went to live
in Boulogne, while Jimmy started a private
oab and three saddle-horses. But to this
day I do not know whether the father ever
thanked James for his devotion."
Of politics Miss Harpole says little;
but here is a bright fresh description of a
dinner-party, as seen by the inexperienced
eyes of a girl just freed from the thraldom
of'the sohool-room:—
"On Thursday night we dined at the
Minister's. It was my first dinner there,
and I trust it will be my last. Every-
thing was wretchedly cooked, and every-
thing came up cold except the champagne.
There was a leading artiole in the Ttmni

the'nextmorning about the inartioulate utterances of the Ministry,
whioh I really think must hare been written by one of the footmen,

1 felt quite sorry for the butler, who looked so respectable that] he
must have been under a suspicion of stealing plate in his last
situation to have accepted such a place, when I thought of the
trouble he would have in assisting'his master to bed."
Space forbids us to say any more on the merits of this charming
work, but we cannot resist one extract which shows how true was
the estimate of the Bishop's noble character:—
"We were one night at the Italian Opera, of which my father was
passionately fond, and during the ballet our attention was drawn
towards a singularly lovely girl on the Stage. 'Alas!' said Colonel
'she is as bad as she is beautiful.' The Bishop immediately
avowed his readiness to investigate the oase at the earliest oppor-
tunity. He was always thinking of others, despite Mamma's
occasional stubborn opposition."
This concludes our notice. In brief, the hook is a most excellent
specimen of the modern style of Memoir, conceived with kindliness of
heart and charity of remembrance, and executed with literary taste,
skill, and polish.

—at all events he is on the best of terms with this one, and then
to arrive at it there is " such a getting up stairs," while the return
journey seems, and probably is, by far the more difficult of the two.
Mr. Geobgk Batty, in a jockey suit, is well worth seeing on his bare-
baoked steed,riding imaginary races in the most extraordinary fashion,
standing, sitting, kneeling, twisting round, coming off, leaping on
while the horse is in full canter, and hardly ever failing to spring
into an attitude at a single boun'l. "Batti! Batti!" as the song
has it, and this Batty, like a good-sized Turkey carpet, would take
a lot of beating. One great attraction for us was that we saw the
distinguished name of Mr. Alfred Austin in the programme serving
as Ring-master, and we wondered how the poetio, but businesslike
Editor of the National Review could manage to find time for this
peculiar sort of work as well. We were prepared to interview
him on the subjeot after the performance, but he turned out to be a
totally different person altogether. We mention this so as to prevent
disappointment.

"If you 're an Australian Member of Parliament, or some grum-
bling loafer of that sort, you know, you had better go and bully
them in Downing 8treet—it's no use trying it on here."
This was my first very natural greeting at the distinguished
Statesman's area-gate. A word or two, however, explained the nature
of my mission, and I soon found myself looking through doors ajar,
and quietly oreeping along back passages under the guidance of my
condescending but communicative informant.
"This," he said, showing me a large empty room with a highly-
polished floor, "is where his Lordship has his favourite game of
Blindman's Buff. He is always at it. But it's mostly on Saturday
afternoons, when he can manage to get the whole Cabinet to come
down and take a turn with him, that he gets his best go. He 'a
'Blindman' the whole time, for he never catches anybody."
"Dear me!" I replied, surprised but interested, "does even the
Foreign Secretary manage to get out of his way P"
"Bless you. Sir, every one of them," was his laoonio answer.
"Besides, he likes being in the dark, and not knowing where he's
going to, he added, thoughtfully. "He's always been like that
ever since he was a hoy."
"Then that may acoount," I suggested, "in some measure for
his apparent indecision in public affairs? You know," 1 continued,
rather emboldened by a slight twinkle I fancied I detected in my
informant's eye, "that what with his saying one thing one day, and
another the next, he sometimes scarcely seems to be politically the
same person for a fortnight together."
"Then you've never heard the story P" asked my guide, opening
another door, and laughing pleasantly to himself P No P Well,
you do surprise me!" he continued, _ ushering me at the same
moment into a handsome apartment, evidently devoted to the per-
formance of private theatricals. "It's very simple; and, as I've
often remarked to myself, explains a good deal."
"Go on I" I said, mechanically.
"Well," he rejoined, "it's merely, you know, that bis Lordship
has always been very fond of this sort of thing." He pointed to the
Stage as he spoke. "Posing and all that, you see—it seems to come
natural to him; and among his chief hits—he only plays to me and
the other gentlemen and the Housekeeper and a few of the uppers—
is The Corsican Brothers. Well in putting that up, and he'a very
careful in Buch things, he got snob, a capital double—a retired
clown,—for the Ghost, that 1 '11 tell you what, Sir, after that per-
formance was over, not one, for the life of us, could tell which was
which, and, though I chalked the Earl myself just to make sure of
him, the next time I met them both at rehearsal, there was no mis-
take about it,—1 couldn't have picked him out if you had offered me
a couple of sovereigns! Now do you understand," he added, with a
significant nod of inquiry, "what has come of that resemblance P"
You don't mean that, when he's tired, he sends—well the other
down to take his place at the Foreign Office?"
"Send him down? Rather. What do you say to his trying it on
at a Cabinet Council, too?"
I involuntarily gave a long low whistle. A light seemed to dawn on
me. Some strange, contradictory, and puzzling evolutions of policy
seemed to be slowly explaining themselves before me.
"But his colleagues P" I asked.
"Suspect something, I fancy,—but are far too 'cute to say any-
thing about it."
This was certainly a strange revelation, yet still did not account
for everything. A thought occurred to me. "His spare time," I
inquired, "how does he spend that?"
We were entering a spacious school-room now. In the window
were two large terrestrial globes; on the walls several colossal maps.
I walked in. At a study-table near the fireplace I discovered
evidences of recent work. 1 looked at the Butler,—but I had antici-
pated his explanation.
"He knows nothing about it,—never did," he said, with an expres-
sive wink. "Betwixt you and me, he's making up for lost time; but
he hasn't got first- olass materials to go upon. Look at that there."
I took up the piece of paper to whioh he pointed. It was a Map of
South Africa, without any indication of the Cameroons.
At that moment a hurried step was heard on the stairs, and we.
instinctively retired behind a huge swing Chart of the Congo, "as
known to Geographers in the year 1837."
"Is it he—or the other?" I asked, in a whisper, as the familiar
figure of the Earl entered the room.
"Blest if I can tell yet. Wait."
The figure sat down at the table, and, throwing up its arms, cried,
almost passionately, "Zanzibar! Who ever heard of Zanzibar!"
"It's him !|" said the Butler, under his hreath.
In another minute I was in St. James's Square—a sadder, bnt
wiser man.

IRELAND'S WORST ENEMIES.
On the part of London Irish Working Men, apprehension has been
expressed that a prejudice against them, excited by the late
Dynamite Outrages, supposed to have been committed by countrymen
of theirs, will subject them to the loss or refusal of employment. As
well think of disbanding the " London Irish" Volunteers for fear of
a Fenian "Devil's Own." It may surely be hoped that no employer
of labour in England will so lose his head in a paroxysm of panic as
to visit the atrocities of American-Irish miscreants on the heads of
Anglo-Irish honest and good fellows. John Bull is not the sort of
Bull to go mad with fright, and behave with the unthinking fury of
a frantic Bull in a China Shop. In the meanwhile, the Irish in our
midst may well take note that the Dynamiters don't care a button
what damage they may do them, whether by ruin of their means of
living, or by blowing them up indiscriminately with their surrounding
neighbours.
IN HIS ELEMENT.
A "Bank Manages" very reasonably the other day inquired in
the columns of a Contemporary, whether, in the face of recent
experience, something ought not to be done to improve the condition
of our Detective Polloe Force? After commenting on the clumsy
"make-up," the slouching march, and general lack of intelligence
that characterise the present British Mouchard, he goes on very
pertinently to ask, whether there is not material from which to form
a corps of superior officials of this stamp to be found " among the
Great Unemployed," suggesting that even Actors without an
engagement" might, with advantage to Society, present themselves
without further delay, and offer their services at Scotland Yard.
There is certainly something in the idea, at least, as far as the
Dramatic profession is concerned; for who could so readily as the
fairly experienced Actor could—either with or without a table for
change of dress,—give a series of those "impersonations" proper
to the detection of crime?
At the present moment there might be some difficulty in finding
recruits; but later in the season, when the "Inventories" are in
full swing, even some distinguished Stars might be induced to take
a turn at the business. There are at least two leading Tragedians
whose manner, voice, and walk, could never be recognised even under
the garb of the ordinary Police Constable; and they might really
with great effect make essay of their powers in the service of the
State as soon as Parliament meets. No man could be better qualified
to prevent the blowing-up of somebody else's house than he who is
in the habit of bringing down his own. Meantime here is a fine
opportunity for the Dramatic School of Art. The President should
look to it.

MEMOIRS OF A BLACK BAG.
{During the Last Wttk or Two.)
I am a Black Bag—I can't help it—I didn't ask to be made black any more
than a nigger; and as for being a ba^, why I would just as soon have been the
Rothschilds' Safe as the Queen's Privy Purse. I'm not particular, I'm not.
But I wish to intimate that, if Black Bags are to be treated as they have been
treated during the last few days, I'd like to emigrate, or be dyed pea-green or
blood-red.
But what am I saying? Why, bless you, they wouldn't let me emigrate if
I could. They'd stop me at any seaport; they'd turn me inside out at every
railway station; and as for being dyed pea-green or scarlet—well, green's the
colour of Ireland, and red's the colour of the Anarchists; and I should like you
to tell me how I should fare under either disguise. No—I'm a Black Bag,
and, what's worse, of the Gladstone persuasion; and my present lot is one I
can't bear, though I have borne lots of various articles in my time.
Look here. I belonged to a Gentleman engaged in travelling for Soap-dealers
eight or ten days ago. I was happy with him. A lot of the soap smelt nice,
and he always wore gloves, even when he unpacked me, because they made an
impression on the young Ladies in the Fancy Stationers'. Well, on a sudden, he
plumps me down in a waiting-room while he goes to buy a bun and an evening
paper. An old Lady Bees me ; there are nineteen simultaneous shrieks from other
old Ladies, and all the soap inside me is melted because the porters insist on
plunging me in a cistern of water before opening me. My owner sold me as
soon as I was dry.
A young Barrister bought me—cheap, and knowing that blue bags were
exploded—ugh! the ugly word!—things, and that Black Bags had superseded
them, he crammed me full of all the manuscript he had had rejected by the
Comio Press. He thought I looked full of briefs; but when he happened to get
a real brief, and rose to address the Court, the Judge caught sight of me, and
only fainted after having ordered me to be thrown out of window and him
disbarred.
I descended in the social scale, and was used as a receptacle for taking
halves of lobsters and slices of salmon home to dinner at Brixton by a whole-
sale Cheesemonger in the City. He was very proud of me for a time (for I
have electro-silver fittings of the very best quality), but when he found that
nine Detectives were keeping guard over his Brixton villa,
and each insisted on examining me down to my lining
whenever he appeared, he began to regard me as an
incubus, and passed me on to his Mother-in-law.
She, being naturally stout, in addition to possessing
me, was arrested every time she entered an omnibus or
even looked at a publio building; and the genial
Bohemian who won me at a subsequent raffle was even
debarred from going into public-houses. Directly the
young Ladies who draw the beer perceived me, they
shrieked so shrilly that the beer turned sour.
I am now the property of a victim who hasn't been
able to lay me down anywhere for four days and five
nights. He has quarrelled with everybody because of
me, and thinks of tying me to his neck, and throwing
himself into the river. I wish he would; only I know I
should float—or set the Thames on fire!

LETTERS IN THE RECESS.
By Eminent Hands.
VI.—ON LORD SALISBURY.
My Dear Lobd Marquis,
I am not quite aire whether, if you could cast your eyes upon me just
now, you would recognise the humble individual who addresses you. Your eyes
are acoustomed, I think I may say with increasing pleasure, to see me, perhaps

a little trimly and squarely, dressed in black clothes, whether it be morning or
evening. As I sit and write in the still early morning in a verandah shaded
from the almost fierce sun by the far-reaching branches of a peepul tree, I am
arrayed in white linen, and am glad to remove my sun-helmet for a moment to
eaten the breath of the slightest wind that blows. Now your Lordship, I
suppose, is sitting by the library fire in Hatfield (a place a little too big to be
comfortable), or looking over the dun and desolate sea from deserted Dieppe.
I like to dwell on these circumstances of widely-varied physical condition, as
they seem in keeping with the not less altered conditions under which our last
correspondence was carried on. Your Lordship will remember it was in connec-
tion with the little scheme, of which you personally were entirely ignorant, for
dispossessing me of the Presidency of our Caucus. I think the correspondence
was rather on one side. I wrote your Lordship two tremendous epistles, but I
don't think you went very deeply into the matter. This was about the time
when, in the House of Commons, I besought Mr. Gladstone to give your Lord-
ship another chance with the Franchise Bill, and denounced anyone who wilfully
flouted the opportunity of conciliation. The correspondence was rather impressed
on my mind Because, a day or two after, I joined a very pleasant dinner-party
in Arlington Street, and the next time I spoke in the House of Commons,
declared that the Lords, in the attitude taken up by them on the Franchise
Bill, were inspired by truly patriotic feelings, and that any who would counsel
concession would deserve the contempt of the country.
Ah me I what ohildren of circumstances we are. How we float hither and
thither like a dried leaf borne upon the breeze, quite uncertain where we shall
fall I Sometimes, do you know, my dear Lord, when I look back upon my
political career, I am quite astonished.
However, it was not myself but your Lordship of whom I sat down to write.
Naturally, I take an interest in your future career. I cannot say I brought your
Lordship up by hand, for it was comparatively late in your life that oiroum-
stances compelled me to take a close personal interest in you. Still, my influence
was so swift in operation and so far-reaching in its effects, that I naturally feel
a responsibility for your future. To that end I will venture in the leisure
moments of a perfect morning to drop a hint for your Lordship's garnering.
You have many advantages as Leader of the Conservative Party in the House
of Peers. The principal one is, that there is no one else possible. Richmond has
been tried, and proved hopelessly innoxious. Caibns wouldn't do at any price;
and Cranbboox, though he could hold his own in a noisy rattling way in debate,
is neither big enough to fill the place, nor sufficiently long-established to presume
to aspire to it. Your Lordship has held the post for some years now, and even
such men as Wolff and Gorst. Still there is something
to be learned from the humblest mind and the least rich
intelligence. Next time you are in a fix (whioh will
probably be before the enu of the Session), don't decide
upon a line to take and then ask Richmond and the rest
what they think of it, announcing at the same time that
your own mind; is made up. The temptation of following
a man who knows which way to turn is so great in an
assembly like the House of Lords, that you are pretty
sure, up to a certain point, to get your own way. This
was aU very well in old times. But times are changed,
and, if I may say so, it is because I appreciate the
change, and endeavour to go in advance of it, that I
attained the successes of the last year.
Take the advice of a well-wisher, my dear Lord, who,
though comparatively young is (at least Wolffy will
have it so) superlatively wise.
Yours faithfully,
Calcutta, January 14. Randolph S. Churchill.
TO A GIRL OP TO-DAY.
A VALENTINE.
My Valentine! say what will take
Your fancy in these wayward times,
What guerdon I can give will make

What fashion of to-day holds fast

And gain the affix of M.P.,

the fond partiality of your Correspondent cannot permit him to deny that your
rule has been a series of disastrous failures, which have shaken to its foundations
an ancient institution. But for my defection, and for all you knew it meant,
you would have hastened the end in November last.
All this comes from vour supremely good opinion of yourself, at which I do
not wonder in the daily comparison with other minds forced upon you by the
>litical companionship that surrounds you on the Benches of the House of

Are you (esthetic, do you dress
In terra-cotta or sage green,

And rhymes that very little mean?

And wear a lily 'mid men's jeers:
If only, Sweetheart, you '11 be true,
As I shall be through all the;
Be medical, prescribe your pills
And draughts to cure us when you please,
Your diagnoses of all ills
Afflicting us must surely please.
'Mid surgeons you may bear your part,
While Lister looks on with surprise;
If you '11 repair my broken heart,
With one glance of your healing eyes.

OUR LIVELY NEIGHBOURS AT THE ROYALTY.
M. Mater's idea of establishing a French Theatre in London is
excellent, and we should be sorry to see it fail for want of adequate
support. It has succeeded up to the present beyond expectation,
and if the venture were still bolder its immediate success would be
certain, and its permanent place among our entertainments assured.
The engagement of Madame Jake Hading and M. Dahala to play
in Le Maitre
de Forget
proved a great
attraction.
When we
saw The Iron-
master at the
St. James's we
were impati-
ent of the
story and of
the people.
Now we un-
derstand our
feeling. The
fact was we
were seeing a
thoroughly
English Actor
and Actress
P 1 » y is?
thoroughly
Frenoh cha-
racters, in a
thoroughly
French play.
Could M. Damala and Madame Jane Hading play William
and Susan in Douglas Jebbold's play? Not a bit of it. If they
attempted it, they would challenge comparison with Mr. and Mrs.
Kendal, just as Mr. and Mrs. Kendal challenged comparison with
M. Damala and Madame Jane Hading in Le Maitre de Forges.
On seeing Madame Jane Hading, the character of Claire became at
once intelligible, and the whole plot, as a story of Frenoh life, possible.
Madame Jane Hading's performance as Claire is very nearly perfect.
It is difficult for an ordinary English playgoer to criticise a French
Actress in such a piece as this, because he cannot precisely say what a
Frenchman,or Frenchwoman, would do in certain given situations, and
therefore he will find himself blaming as overacting what has simply
to be set down to a correct representation of Gallic vivacity. Now, as
Claire, Madame Jane Hading repeats one action with her right arm
in every strong situation. But thromghout her performance there are
those touches of nature which elicit sympathy from every audience.
As for M. Damala, he has the tricks and manners of the Frenoh
Actor, and might have been, possibly he was, an adequate represen-
tative of a Frenoh Ironmaster. His performance was jerky; but
perhaps French Ironmasters are jerky; he thumped his chest in
his excitement, which may be exactly what Frenoh Ironmasters do
when excited. However this may be, the incontestable fact
remains, that with any haphazard scenery, without any costly
mounting, with only a fair ordinary French Company, with Actresses
of no distinction, and wearing costumes which were neither elegant
nor costly, the piece was so well acted as to attract crowded houses
night after night during its run.
. Madame Jane Hading played also in Frou-Frou, but good as she
ii in this, better, in respect of looking the part, than Sarah
Bernhardt could ever be, she could not, of course, any more than
could Sarah, touch AimF:e Desclee, for whom the part was origin-
ally written, and whose acting of it is even now fresh in our memories.
Another Jane is there now—Jane Mat. We have not yet seen
her at her best, and so we should mark the difference between the
two Janes by saying of the one " Jane Can," and of the other,
"Jane Mat." Jane Mat has_ been playing Chaumont's part in
Divorcons, and cleverly she did it ;lbut,most English playgoers have

The two Janes, qui ne nous ginent pas.
seen Chat/mont in this piece, either in London or Paris, so that we
question whether it can be much of an attraction.
_M. Mater's venture requires most energetic management, and we
with him good luck. A good small working company, playing French
novelties, and reviving some of the old pieces, ought to be an institu-
tion here, with a special matinee now and then for the classics, and
an occasional star to shine through the London fogs in the winter.
AFTER ALL!
"A phrase I detest—the little phrase 'After all.' "—Mi-. Goschen at
Edinburgh.
Sagacious Goschen, right you
are!
(As generally you are right)
The paling of the British Star,
In peaceful Trade, in patriot
Will follow "fumbling," feeble,
flabby,
And yet the phrase on which
you fall
Has senses not entirely shabby,
After all!
True there are twaddlers in the
State,
Traitors from folly or intent,
Who loudly lie, or vaguely prate,
Soul-bound by care for cent, per
cent.
But we have patriots stout and
true,
Statesmen who brood and do
not bawl,
Like—well, Sir, we may say like
you,
After all!
True, panders to the eager herd
Pour from our platforms bale-
ful blends
Of the unjust and the absurd,
For party aims or private
ends.
But their pea-bladders vainly
shake;
Cool sense will rouse at the
right call,
And make the quacks drop jaw,
and quake,
After all!
True, nerveless noodles aim to
hold
The reins of England's con-
quering car;
Hucksters in word-fray only bold,
Bunglers in peace and curs in
war.
But Cockney pseudo-Phaethon
Will never have the Country's
call;
She knows the true Automedon,
After all!
True, Shilly-Shally has its day,
The toothless tyke, like other
dogs;
And polioy awhile may stray
In faction's fens, 'midst blun-
der's bogs.
Yet, Sir, late feats of Sword and
Pen
Prove, what shall save the old
Land from fall,
That Englishmen are Englishmen,
After all!

LANDED I
The Portuguese having seized the Congo, other aggressive measures
by rival Powers are hourly expected. The following list of recent
acquisitions may be relied upon as (all but) authentic :—Switzerland
has annexed the North Pole, in spite of the remonstrances of the
Czar and the Sublime Porte; Roumania has declared a Protectorate
of all that remains of Australasia, much to the indignation of the
Government of New South Wales; Belgium has proclaimed Mexico
and other South American Republics a part of her Colonies, regardless
of the threatened assassination of her Consul in Washington; and.

BALLAD OF THE ICHTHYOSAURUS.
[The Ichthyosaurus laments his incomplete development and imperfect education. He
aspires to better things.]

I abide in a goodly Museum
Frequented by sages profound,
In a kind of a strange mausoleum,
Where the beasts that have vanished
abound.
There's a bird of the Ages Triassic
With his antediluvian beak,
And many a reptile Jurassic,
And many a monster antique!
Ere Man was developed, our brother,
We swam, and we ducked, and we
dived,
And we dined, as a rule, on eaoh other.
What matter, the toughest survived!
Oar paddles were fins, and they bore us
Through water,—in air we could fly;
But the brain of the Ichthyosaurus
Was never a match for his eye!
The geologists, active and eager,
Its excellence hasten to own,
And praise, with no eulogy meagre.
The eye that is plated with bone!
"See how, with unerring precision,
His prey through the waves he could spy;
Oh, wonderful organ of vision.
Oigantio and beautiful eye I"
Then I listen in gloomy dejection,
I gaze, and I wish I could weep,
For what is mere visual perfection
To Intellect, subtle and deep?
A loftier goal is before us,
For higher endowments we sigh,
But—the brain of the Ichthyosaurus
Was never a patch on his eye!
It owned no supreme constitution,
Was shallow, and simple, and plain,
While mark but the fair convolution
And size of the Aryan brain I
'Tis furnished for School-Board inspections,
And garnished for taking degrees,
And bulging in many directions,
As every phrenologist sees.
Sometimes it explodes at high pressure
In harsh, overwhelming demand,
But, plied in unmerciful measure,
It's wonderful what it will stand!
In cottage, in college, and mansion
Bear witness the girls and the boya,
How great are its powers of expansion,
How very peculiar its joys!
0 Brain that is bulgy with learning,
0 Wisdom of women and men,
0 Maids for a First that are yearning,
0 Youths that are lectured by Wren!
You're acquainted with Pisces and Taurus
And all sorts of beasts in the sky,
But the brain of the Ichthyosaurus
Was never so good as his eye!
Reconstructed by Dab win or Owen
We dwell in sweet Bloomsbury's halls,
But we couldn't have passed Little-go inj
The Schools; we'd nave floundered in Smalls!
Though so cleverly people restore us
We are bound to confess, with a sigh,
That the brain of the Ichthyosaurus
Was never so good as his eye!
THE BUTLERS OF GREAT MEN.
(Interviewed by Our Own Bar I-stairs Representative.)
No. III.—At Professor R-sx-n's.
I experienced no difficulty whatever in getting into the groundsi
for, as every one knows, perfect consistency is the key-note to the
distinguished Professor's character. The apostle who has so long
preached the ungrudging diffusion of light and. beauty among the
masses, is naturally not the man selfishly to wall up his flower-beds
and kitchen-garden, or, for the matter of that, the contents of his
plate-chest. As I expected, there was no sort of hindrance to my
movements, and I soon found myself, in company with many strag-
gling loafers, not only roving at my leisure all over the place, but
strolling about the house, invading the rooms, and even prying into
unlocked drawers, and turning over their contents with an ease and
freedom that were, in their way, as novel as they were delightful.
My chief trouble, however, was to get hold of the great man's Butler.
"He will not," I said to myself, "be exactly like any ordinary
man's Butler.'' I was quite right. He was not. I found him in
the drawing-room, lounging, in his shirt-sleeves, on an American
chair, and smoking a long clay pipe, with his legs on the mantel-
piece. As I entered, he was looking carelessly over a few loose
Botticellis that stood in a pile on a music-stool beside him. He rose
with a good-humoured laugh at my approach. I rapidly explained
the nature of my business.
"You want to see what kind of a place we live in?" he began,
pleasantly. "Certainly." he resumed, stepping out into the verandah
as I followed him. "This is Libert? Hall, and no mistake, as the
Governor says, so make your own little game, and go where you
like. We don't lock up nothing here. Art, bless his 'art, I say,—
is free to everybody. That's what refines 'em. Look at me!" he
continued, growing a little more communicative as we stood opposite
a large painted notioe-board bearing the legend, " You are requetted
to walk on the grate and pick the flowert;" yon wouldn't have
thought it, but I was a Brummagem burglar onoe; but I 'ye been
levelled up to this here by looking at rare old prints, learning a step
or two of a Greek hornpipe, and pulling buttercups to pieces by the
bushel just to see what's inside of 'em!"
I was much interested. "Indeed?" I responded, almost in-
quiringly, turning at the same time towards the rather unusual
announcement on the notioe-board. "And does he," I continued,
"really mean and act up to that P"
"Aot up to it f Rather! Why, we very nearly stuokin ' You
may worry the waterfowl, too, if you like;' only he thought it might
pr'aps lead up to a Museum of Stuffed Birds, or something fiddling of
that sort, which isn't his idea of getting what he calls a good
1 lesson' out of 'em, don't you know. So we just stuck to the grass;
not that many takes advantage of it; for your true child of culture
with nobler aims and aspirations, as the saying is, prefers rum-
maging about in the house and taking away some artistic memento
quietly in his pocket, if it's only a bit of old Chelsea, just to remind
him of" ■' •
his lr
always
too hot."
a He looked at me with much significance as he spoke, and I pos-
sibly might have replied, but at this moment, as we turned the angle
of the house, a group of middle-aged but myrtle-crowned revellers
eame full into view, rolling about, apparently in some pain, on the
velvet and beautifully-kept lawn.
"Who are these P" I asked, involuntarily,

"Them?" was"the laconic reply. "A party ofJeonvertedJStock-
brokers, who have given up money-making after taking) in and
reading all the back numbers of Fors Clavigera. Some people Bays
they 're off their heads. Not they. It 'a only the wine."
1 looked at my informant for explanation.
"That 'b all," he continued, surveying the writhing group with
amused but critical interest. "The Governor won't have any of
your modern mixtures,—champagne, and all that. Not a bit of it.
But he gives 'em ' pure Falernian,'—that's what he calls it; only
he won't have any but the ancient dodges of bottling, which don't
improve it for drinking after three months.
"' Lymmaotcs Maximus,' he '11 say to me, 'the neoter of the
immortal gods is not to be subjected to the everlasting infamy of
prisonship in a Nineteenth Century Worcester Sauce bottle; leave it
free to the pure blue of Heaven in the open amphora.' And so I do,—
and that's why," he continued, pointing to the lively group before
us, "it often gets a little corked."
We were in the house again now. I noticed that everywhere there
were no signs of tbe comfort or luxury of these latter days, but that,
conformably with the magnificent consistency of the great denunciator
of all modern labour and progress, the rooms were cheerless, uncom-
fortable, and bare. But I was fatigued, and I sat down on the first
thing that came to hand, a rude construction that I took to be a sort
of iron armchair. As I did so, however, the back came off, the
bottom came out, and I was violently precipitated on to the floor.
I rose, rubbing my elbow. My companion smiled.
"You had better have left that alone," he remarked, "it's the
last of six he made without a furnace. Ton know his hobby about
putting^an end to factory-chimbleys, and all that? Well— that's
what lQneans. It's all very well raving at Brummagem—but it's
no joker I can tell you, having to use a flower-pot for a fish-
kettle I"
I was about to reply when a weary, worn-out, mud-begrimed
figure staggered into the room, and flung itself, exhausted, on to a
bundle of hay and rushes in the corner.
"Come along," whispered my guide, "that's the Governor just
arrived I And isn't he done, rather?"
"Is it far from the Station?" I inquired, softly.
"The Station?" he replied, looking at me from head to foot.
"Why, don't you know Railways is his abomination? Bless you,
he has walked the whole way—every inch!"
"Every inch? Where from?"
"Where from? Why, from Oxford. He always does."
"Dear me!" I said to myself as I got into the omnibus for
Ambleside, "the Great Professor is certainly a consistent man!"

PUBLIC GRIEVANCES.
{By Our Own Inspector.)
No. IV.—Domestic Skbvakts.
Commuhications upon the old, old grievance, so crowd upon me,
that I feel compelled to give it the next place in my terrible list.
What a fearful experience I'am gaining of the miserable lives passed
by a large number of my fellow-countrymen and countrywomen, of
what are ironically called the higher classes of Society, in regard to
this one especial grievance; ana how heartily grateful should that
portion of the public be who are compelled by their fortunate poverty
to do without this domestic plague. I can only ask for room for a
very few samples, leaving the Public to imagine the rest by drawing
upon their own sad experience :—
Bib,—I ask you to allow me to state my own grievance, whioh is
prol
your ready sympathy. I reside some twenty miles from London,
eight miles from a Railway Station, so we are as nice and quiet all
the year round as any reasonable Servant can require to be. My
good, husband is of a very studious disposition, and, when he is in
his study, it is understood that he must not be disturbed, as the
slightest noise affects his sensitive temper for the rest of the day.
My poor daughter is an invalid, and I, unfortunately, am rather
deaf, so our Servant has nothing whatever from morning till night
to take off her attention from her various duties; and yet, with all
these advantages, and £10 a year, I find such difficulty in
keeping my Servants, that the constant change worries my poor
husband, worries my poor daughter, and worries me. The strangest
thing is that not one of them will ever give me a reason for leaving
my quiet paradise. Nothing but some such silly excuse as that
"it's quite enough to drive a poor girl mad," or, as one saucy minx
said, "I shouldn't object to an earthquake for a change!" or, as
another said, " I might as well be in a deaf and dumb Asylum." I
wish some kind soul would explain this mystery to me. E. G.
Sib,—I thank you heartily, beforehand, for giving me the chance
I have so long waited for. I believe myself to be about the most
patient and long-suffering householder in the whole Metropolis, and
my wife, who is truthfulness itself, especially as quarter-day
approaches, confirms me in that belief, but on this particular subject
of "Household Pests," patience becomes imbecility and forbearance
a orime. Why should my Home cease to be " Sweet Home," thanks
to my slovenly lazy Housemaid, and my "Joints be out of time," as
Hamlet says, thanks to my irregular Cook, and my Children allowed
to scream themselves hoarse and me wild with excitement, thanks to
my stupid Nurse? I use the word " thanks " ironically, you will know
what word it represents. As I shall shortly lose my three treasures (!),
I have some thoughts of advertising somewhat as follows:—
"Three young Ladies wanted as useless Helps in the family of a
Gentleman. No oharacter required. Caps and aprons at discretion.
No especial hours for rising or retiring, or for taking necessary
exercise. Very liberal diet, good wine-cellar, and Bass's Pale Ale always
on draught. Followers allowed from 8 to 11 p.m. A quiet friendly
dance for them and their friends once a month. Two Barrel Organs
daily, and a Brass Band twice a week. A month at the Seaside
every summer, either Margate or llamsgate, as may be preferred.
Salaries on a most liberal scale, and everything found. Each young
Lady is requested to bring her own silver fork and spoon, which will
be cleaned for her by the Page. The Employer cleans his own boots,
gives no trouble, and answers the street-door bell if within hearing.
His wife does most of the menial duties, but requests assistance in
making the beds and in dusting the drawing-room. A man attends
every morning to do all the disagreeable work. Apply, at the most
convenient time, to C. 8., near the Bankruptcy Court, Basinghall
Street, E.C. P.S.—There is a Piano in the front kitchen, and tickets
areprovided for the Monday Pops throughout the Season."
This would probably bring ns a change; and as any change must
be an improvement, I nave serious thoughts of trying it. C. S.
SrB,—Where are our old uncomplaining Household Drudges, who,
being unable to either read or write, had nothing to distract their
attention for a single hour from their work, and were therefore as
useful and unoomplaining as our horses and dogs and our other
domestic animals? Ah 1 those were happv days, in those good old
times, which, I fear, will never return. Why it is, I cannot under-
stand, but absolute devotion to other people's interest, such as we
reasonably expeot from those we kindly employ, is getting rarer and
rarer every day, and the only effect of educating those beneath us is
exaotly what I always foreboded it would be; that is, to make them
dissatisfied with our reasonable requirements. Take my own case,
for instance. All that I require and expect is, absolute obedience
without remonstrance or remark, absolute willingness—nay, eager-
ness—to meet my wishes in every respect, and absolute contentment,
displayed in constant cheerfulness, good humour, and punctuality.
And yet I find increasing difficulty in obtaining them, although
I do give £9 a year, and two half-pints of beer a day. D. B.
Silt,—My opinion of the greatest plagues of civilised life is short,
sharp, and decisive. Servants are simply our intolerable masters
and our unendurable mistresses. I am a housekeeper of but two
years' standing, but I have had such praotical experience of the
numberless forms of misery that they can and do inflict upon us,
that I feel aB well qualified to speak of them as the oldest sufferer
among us. I am, to my sorrow, a collector of articles de vertn.
Presuming, I suppose, in their dense ignorance, that these priceless
treasures are improved by what are called flaws, there is scarcely
one of them that is not chipped, or cracked, or otherwise maltreated
by their heavy blundering hands. Complaint is useless, or worse.
I don't dare give them warning, fearing what irreparable mischief
the wondrous Cat might oommit during the perilous month preceding
their departure. 80 I endure my miserable and anxious existence
as best I may, and treat my Tyrants with"

UNIFIED AND THE LION!
(After Spenser—more or lest.)

The Lion would not leave her desolate,
But with her went along, a potent guard
Of her per-centages; in truth, her state,
Without his guarantee, had seemed hard.
So—winkingty—his eye kept watch and ward,
And in her interests he was diligent;
And little plans, to save her loss, prepared,
And kept olose watch upon the Frank, intent
That forfeit she should not a needless Half-per-Cent. I
THE SHRIEKING BROTHERHOOD;
Or, Just a little Overdone on both Sides.
THE SITUATION-(SELECTED EXTRACTS ON).
The Threepenny Swashbuckler says :—If the sound and fatherly,
if not always infallible counsel that we have now persistently for the
last nineteen months been again and again in the habit of hurling at
the heads of the fatuous dreamers and doctrinaires to whom the des-
tinies and the duties of the nation are entrusted, had only been
received with the implicit confidence of a blind and becoming respect,
there would be no occasion for us at this hour to be asking, in the
stern and dignified language of baffled expectancy, "Where are we
now?" Fortunately, the course that lies before the country is
clearly marked out for it. No pusillanimous compromise with the
necessities of the situation are conceivable. Physical experts may tell
ui that Nature has not provided the arid deserts of hyper-Central
Africa with an adequate water-supply. Nature must correct herself.
She must understand that where the interested British Bondholder
is brought face to face with the impossible, it is not the interested
British Bondholder that can give way. The fact that no European
life can be supported during a summer campaign, with the ther-
mometer at 150° in the shade, is not a matter of which political
common-sense can take any serious account. It is purely a question
for Parliament, and that Parliament will know how to deal with it
promptly and vigorously cannot for a moment be doubted by any one
who Has watched and rightly interpreted the practical and patriotic
spirit of the hour.
The Daily Dastard says:—To go forward at such a crisis is to
incur the indelible reproach of yielding to the dictates of a moral
cowardice as craven as it is expensive. What the country requires
at the present moment is, not the vulgar and Haunting self-confidence
to set down its foot and advance, but the supreme courage to turn tail
and run away. A rash show of determination may now, even at this
eleventh hour, undo the beneficent and wholesome work of months
of compromise. There is only one course left for England to take.
"*ith fearless front, and head erect, proudly conscious of the fact
that the eyes of nobody in particular are upon her, let her nobly and
firmly scuttle out of her present difficulty as fast as her legs can
carry her. That her fleeing forces are pursued by a blood-red rolling
wave of chaotic rebellion is nothing to her. Her business is not with
the uncertain and shifting sands of humanity, but with the firm and
sure ground of self-interest. "Retreat—and at a low figure "—this
U the glorious legend, that should inspire her policy. Suoh words
ihould De written in letters of gold round the hat of every thoughtful
nd economical patriot in the tnree kingdoms.
The Bedlam Gazette says:—This is no season for set phrases and
soft speeohes. From the days of Heliogabaxub and Nebo, down to
the days of the Carmagnole and the Carnatio, there have been
monsters in human shape, but they have not, as far as we know,
been suffered to sit on the Treasury Bench. Times are changed.
Yet is there no remedy? Only folly gone crazed with precedent
could answer "No." What is now unanimously required by the
whole country is a lesson, and we have no hesitation in saying that
the beheading without a trial of the entire Ministry on Tower Hill,
would send a thrill of pleasure through the length and breadth of
this great Empire, suoh as it has not known since the scattering of
the Armada or the signing of the Magna Charta. So much for action
at home. For the rest there can be no doubt as to our attitude
abroad. Every European ambassador at present accredited to our
Court at St. James's must be kicked from one end of Pall Mall to the
other, while not less than a hundred and fifty thousand men should
without an instant's delay be thrown as a preliminary step some-
where on to the Red Sea Littoral, for the purpose of seizing,
fortifying, and garrisoning the Equator. When this is done, it
will be time enough to talk about what we shall do next.
The Evening Bray says':—As we have predicted all along, and
must now be evident to the most impartial observer, it is not the
position of a handful of hot-headed, if valorous Englishmen in a
distant land that really seriously demands the attention of a wise
and well-regulated Government. The approaching Session will soon
show that, though a temporary rabies appeared for a brief moment
to have attacked the country, it still may he said in the fullest sense
to possess '' mens sana in corpore sano." Such burning questions as
are embodied in the Female Proportional Representation, aud the
Looal Warm Baths Construction and Repairs Bill are not likely to
be shelved because a few alarmists imagine that the foreign occupa-
tion of Egypt, followed by the loss of India and our Colonial Empire
could for a moment be regarded as a serious factor in any estimate of
the future position and prosperity of the country.

Your little hands were never made
To tear each other's eyes.

Not "made" to tear? Well, what
of that?
No more, at first, were claws.
All comes by adaptation, fool!
No need of Final Cause.
And if we use the hands to tear,
Just as the nose to smell,
Ere many ages havo gone by
They '11 do it very well.

Stole a pig, and away he 'ran' "?

When the wind blows
The cradle will rock.
When the bough breaks

So familiar, you see,
As hardly to need

Do you really wonder, Jane?
And to me all seems so plain!

And if heavenly bodies
Still remain beyond yoi..
You had better go and ax
Good Professor Paeallax.
Nurse.
Bye, Baby-bunting,
Father's gone a-hunting,
All to get a rabbit's skin
To wrap the Baby-bunting in.
Baby (sternly).
The cruel sport of hunting
To moral sense is stunting;
And since Papa's objection
To useful vivisection
Convicts him, as it seems to me,
Of Bignal inconsistency,
I must with thanks decline the
skin
For wrapping Baby-bunting in.

VERY CIVIL LAW.
In the Court of Appeal last week several cases in the list had to'be
dismissed with costs, struck oat. or put the last on the paper,
because the Counsel engaged in them were actually speaking in
other parts of the building." In one instance Mr. Babdswell, who
appeared for the Respondent, saying that he "desired to assist
Mr. Buckley, who represented the Appellant, so far as he properly
could," offered to read a will to fill up the time, while his learned
friend in another place was polishing off the matter he had then in
hand. The Lords Justices Bagoallay and Bowen did their best to
fall in with the arrangement—the latter expressing great anxiety to
do " what is kind to Counsel." As no doubt other instances will
occur when Counsel will be unable to be in two places at the same
time, the following dramatic sketch of what should happen under
suoh circumstances may he useful as a precedent:—
Scene—The Court of Appeal. Present—Three Lords Justices more
or less atleep. Usual Sprinkling of Bar. Empty Gallery.
"Smith yersus Snooks" called. Only Mr. Whioblock appears,
and answers for the Respondent.
Senior Lord Justice. Dear me, and we are at the end of the paper!
Who is aeainst you, Mr. Whioblock P
Mr. Whigblock. Mr. Hobatio Twaddle, my Lord. I believe
my friend is actually at this moment speaking in another Court.
S. L. J. Do you think he will be very long?
Mr. W. (looking round, and seeing that the Reporters are "safe ").
No, my Lord. I believe he is arguing a matter in which some
hundred of thousands of pound* are at stake.
S. L. J. Dear me, that sounds like a lengthy proceeding.
Mr. W. (smiling). Yes, my Lord; but as I understand that my
friend's brief was only delivered last night, I fancy it is one of those
oases in whioh a Counsel goes into Court " to hear all about it."
S. L. J. Ah! I see. Just so! Well, we must fill up the time.
Mr. W. My oase has some slight connection with patents. Perhaps
your Lordships would be pleased to hear me upon the history of
intents from the earliest period up to the present day P
8. L. J. (hurriedly). Nothing would give me more unalloyed
pleasure: but I would not trouble you for worlds.
^Second and Third L. JJ. (in a breath). We heartily concur.
Mr. W. (hurt). I have nothing more to say. (Sulks.)
"jS. L. J. Come, come, Mr. Whioblock, surely we can fill up the
time in some other manner. Is Mr. Briefless with you in this
case? (The rising young Junior of fifty blushes, and smilingly
bows.) If I remember rightly, I fancy Mr. Briefless, at the Circuit-
Mess, years ago, you used to have something to tell ns about " the
Three Jolly Post-boys of Tooting Common." (Laughter.) Perhaps
Mr. Briefless will once more repeat his recollections of those excel-
lent and eminent persons. (Renewed laughter.)
(Old-fashioned Comic Song—Mr. Briefless.)
Mr. W. (annoyed at being cut out by his Junior). I had no idea
your Lordships would accept such evidence.
S. L. J. We must give ourselves a little latitude, so as to do all
that we can to be kind to Counsel. But we shall be glad to hear
you on any matter, Mr. Whioblock, that you think will interest us.
Mr. W. (toith some diffidence). May it please your Lordships. I
have had some experience in Amateur Conjuring, and during tie

and-Eightpence," and " The Inexhaustible Retainer."
Mr. Horatio Twaddle (who has been heartily applauding his
Opponent's performances, rising at the end of the Programme.) I

KITH AND KIN.
Canada [to Britannia). "If I can bb of any Assistance, command MB." {And so say Victoria and New South Wales.)
A STRANGE COMBINATION.
The following Advertisement from the Daily Telegraph, strikes
us aa a novelty:—
TO TAILORS.—A Solicitor of experience wishes to undertake legal
basinets as an equivalent for his tailoring. Address, &c.
One would like very much to know how the accounts hetween the
Solioitor and the Tailor would he arranged. How many dress-suits
would go to a lawsuit, and whether the Solicitor would charge the
Tailor six-and-eightpence when he oame to fit on a new coat. And if,
when the 8olioitor called to look at trouser-patterns, suoh an inter-
view would be charged as a "consultation" in the bill ? . Another odd
thing strikes us, the Advertiser wishes to undertake legal business
"as an equivalent for his tailoring." As a Solicitor, he can " solicit"
orders; as a Tailor, he can execute them. And then he would not
only send you in hills, hut he would sue you promptly if you did
not pay them, and charge you for the letters he wrote on the subject.
The combination of the two callings strikes us as being dreadful.
Theory and Pbactick.—The present period has been denomi-
nated an age of Discovery. Our learned ones discover traces of pre-
historic Man, track the Trilohite, and detect the Protoplasm. But

UNIVERSITY REFORM.
Oxbridge PcrruquUr (to Tutor of Boniface). "Don't you think, Sir, it's an
EXCELLENT Till NO THAT THE YoUNG GENTLEMEN CAN PA8S THEIR LlTTLE Go,

MAKING QUITE SURE OF THEM.
Tee excellent precautionary New Rales drawn np by the Speaker for the
admission of Strangers to the House of Commons have been farther supple-
mented by the following brief Code, regulating
The Entrance of Members.
1. The custom that has hitherto obtained of Members entering the House
by the ordinary approaches is, owing to the blocking-up of all the doors by
concrete, temporarily suspended.
2. Members anxious, nevertheless, to take their seats, will, after passing a
medical examination, finding bail for themselves to the extent of £7000, insuring
their lives, and producing their certificates of baptism, together with written
testimonials from not less than five highly respectable and well-known Peers,
be let down by a rope through the roof by the Serjeant-at-Arms, assisted by
a certified Usher and a Policeman in plain clothes.
3. Tea, oold meat, cigars, snuff, oranges, and soda water, will lie permanently
on the table of the House, and be obtainable by Members on payment of a
small charge, accompanied with substantial references from a Bank Director to
the Attorney-General.
4. The Ladies' Gallery will be iron-cased and hermetically sealed, and contain
only one Reporter, who will be fed from time to time by food thrust on hop-
poles from the top of the Speaker's Chair through the grating. On his showing
the slightest signs of "going off," the House will adjourn as speedily
as possible.
5. On an Adjournment being declared, Members desirous of getting out of the
House rapidly, will, if not expert climbers, manage it as best they can.
A Blunt Proposal.—If Mr. Gladstone's Cabinet had only listened to Mr.
Wilfrid Blunt's propositions,—at least, so says the latter,—our Soudanese
difficulties would have come to an end long ago. But now we shall have
to pay heavily for the war, and this in consequence of the Cabinet still sticking
to the cry of "Down with ' the blunt' I"

"NEAR NEIGHBOURS."
The home-life of the Dutch,
Sketched with eloquent touch,
Forms the scene of Miss Peard's latest labours:
And the story is such
That you '11 find there is much
To like in her pleasant Near Neighbours!
"CREATURES OF CLAY."
Lady Violet Grevtlle has writ, by the way,
A tale that perusal will amply repay.
E'en critical carpers won't dare to gainsay,
There's plenty of life in her Creatures of Clay .'
"FOUND OUT."
Miss Mathers you '11 find quite at home in Found Out.
You '11 wonder, perchance, what the ttory's about?
Close-packed in one volume—'tis better than three—
Well concealed to the close, is a weird mysteree!
You quickly will learn, if you read, without doubt,
And soon will find out, when you 've finished Found Out!
"SALLY."
Air—" Sally in Our Alley."
A novel that you ought to read—
With fun and pathos blended—
Its plot is very good indeed,
And bound to be commended:
And o'er its leaves no doubt you will
Most dearly love to dally;
'Tis smartly written by John Hill,
And is entitled Sally!
PRO BONO PUBLICO.-IMPORTANT NOTICE.
The Directors of the Metropolitan Extension Dissension
Railway Company beg to announce that, with a view to
Pleasing the Inhabitants of London,
they have made arrangements to introduce several im-
portant improvements. Feeling that a shelter is required
in Charing Cross, they have determined to erect
Ornamental Gas-Works in Trafalgar Square,
which will not only be beautiful but useful. As a sub-
way between the Exhibition Building at South
and Hyde Park may at some future date become
sary, they have decided instantly to construct
A Permanent Barrier across Piccadilly,
which will entirely divert the very considerable traffic in
this thoroughfare into other channels. Further, as water
may some day become scarce for the use of the Company's
locomotives, the Directors, with a view to suiting the
convenience of the Public, have decided upon immediately
Drying up the Serpentine
and the Artificial Lake in the St. James's Park. As the
Government have refused to permit windows to be made
in the tunnels, in such a way as to afford a good view of
the private apartments in Buckingham Palace, the
Directors have determined upon the
Removal of all Lamp-Posts in Grosyenor Place,
which action should be considered as a great convenience,
except at night or in foggy weather. Other improve-
ments are in contemplation.
New Novel.—Diana of the Crosstcays, by Geohge
Meredith. Is this the story of an ill-tempered young
person? "Better read it, and see," is the Publisher's
evident answer.
Question for Belligerents.—When a'
concluded," does war commence immediately?
A Contemplated Challenge.—Calling out the Militia
and the Volunteers.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVARI.
THE LAST BALLY.
The trumpet sound! Bid the shrill blast
Blare forth the Rally! 'Tis the last
On this well-stricken field!
For sullenly comes down the night
On battered helms, on failing fight.
But still some remnants of their might
Make muster, though in piteous plight,
Not brokenly to rush on night,
Nor orayenly to yield.
Once more the tattered banner lift!
With many a rag and many a rift;
Like an old raven's wing
Slowly it flaps the leaden air;
And many a Knight is gathered there
Round their old Chief, to do or dare,
In olosely serried ring.
That Chief sits high, his look is stern,
Beneath knit brows his glances burn,
But wan his face, and worn.
Full wearily for many an hour,
Against ill-fortune, foeman dour,
He field has held; now fate-clouds lour
Above that band forlorn.
The fight aforetime seemed to go
Not hopelessly—the baffled foe
Shocked, shivered, seemed to fly;
And triumph with familiar glow
Fired the old Chieftain's eye.
But laggard charge and faltering front
Betrayed him; some who battle s brunt
Should manfully have met.
Paused here, broke were, and he it seemed
Doubted o'er long or blindly dreamed.
Whilst o'er the ill-set battle streamed
The day's broad light-flood yet.
And now the night, like Fate's black wing,
Sweeps o'er the field, Egyptian thing
That dims and darkens all!
Back driven o'er that crawling flood,
Whose shadowy dusk is dashed with blood,
Slow, shakenly they fall.
Time only for one last stern stand,
With dinted helm and battered brand I
So as they scramble to the land
Ere utter darkness reign,
One rally of that strioken band
Shall end the long campaign.
Blow, Trumpeter, a blast of might!
Fierce in the face of following night
One last defianoe fling!
And gather, gather, henchmen stout,
With grim-set teeth that check the shout
Your oft-victorious Chief about
In stern and steely ring;
"Stand, Hartington, unshaken stand,
Clenched hands on your big battle-brand,
And, gravely, grimly loyal, gaze
Far forth into the thickening haze
Through which the foemen loom!
Close, stalwart Harcourt, high of helm,
Cool Spencer, whom no cares can whelm,
Brave Squire Treveltan, quick to set
Buckler or blade or burgonet
Or knight to play, or groom!
Brace you, soft Northbrook, for the
shock,
Chxldebs, whate'er the wallet's stock
Stand, eye like fire and foot like rook!
Buckle you, gallant Dilke!
And Granville, keen yet something slow,
Close up, close up, we wait the foe 1
This is the hour for swashing blow,
For steel, and not for silk.
Out from the reeds 1 let not your feet
There tangled stay, the foe is fleet.
Up Debut, man 1 Good lack!
That laggard pace, that fumbling clutch
Anger true warrior overmuoh.
Say, doth it irk thee, the cold touch
Of armour on thy back?
Like Barbarossa thou wilt sink
Mailed, in mid-stream. Scramble and
shrink
No longer, halting knight!
Up 1 Up! Egyptian darkness now
Steals over all. Blow, bugler, blow!
Ere AJAX-doom be ours, I trow.
With serried front, with dauntless brow,
Foot on firm earth, face to the slough,
Once more we '11 brave the fight!"
POUR SE DISTRAIRE."
While we were pathetically sympathising with the Grand, but
unfortunate Old Man, and humming to a Gilbert-and-Sullivan
strain our opinion that—
When " Parl«mentary" duty's to be done, to be done,
Then " a Premier's " lot ia not a happy one, happy one!
and while on Tuesday evening we were picturing to ourselves "the
Gladstonian heart bowed down by weignt of woe " over Egyptian
intelligence (or the want
of it) in a brown study
at Downing Street, or the
Gladstonian head bowed
down over the open page

ing how " oountless woes"
fell on the Greeks, and
how " the souls of many
heroes were hurled down

formed us, was enjoying
the performance of Mr.
Justin Macartht's
sprightly version of Le

the Criterion; and on
the following night,
Wednesday, the stolid
Marquis of Hartington
sat in the Stalls of the
Prince's "taking in through the pores" the brilliant wit of
Sheridan's immortal School for Scandal.
Onces perhaps, in the evening, the thought of the necessity for
employing Indian Troops, the chances of "getting ourselves dis-
liked" by his Chief's Italian proclivities, and of the probability of
being obliged to call in the assistance of the Unspeakable Turk,
might have occurred to the noble Lord's mind; and when he heard
Joseph—not Chamberlain—but Surface exclaim, "A curious
dilemma, truly, my politics have run me into 1" it is conceivable
that he might have longed, to have had the Premier by his side just
to have pointed the application with a quiet nudge. Perhaps other
Members of the Cabinet were equally enjoying themselves elsewhere.

SCUTTLE V. GRAB.
A Chronicle of the {Probable) Future.
A.D. 1890. Grab Party in power. Forward policy everywhere.
Annexation all round. Fifty Millions spent upon Army and Fleet.
National Society for the Seizure of Everything holds its first meet-
ing at St. James's Hall. Resolution moved that " the whole of the
world, land and water, at present unoccupied by Civilised Powers
belongs of right to England." Carried unanimously. Scheme
formulated for rectifying Scientiflo Frontier of whole of British
possessions. Is found to involve seizure of sixteen islands, conquest
of five native races, absorption of fifty thousand square miles of—
useless—new territory, seven small wars, two large ones, four
massacres, and an Income-tax of five shillings in the pound. John
Bull rebels, and turns out Grab Party.
A.D. 1895. Scuttle Party comes in with big majority and bigger
promises. Finishes off all wars by caving in all round, retiring
everywhere and relinquishing everything. Cuts down Army, and
resolves to sell half the Ironclad Fleet as old metal. Power which
buys it immediately utilises it against us. Another Fleet hai to be
ordered at onoe at fancy prices in response to Press clamonr. f outtle
Party, in oleft stick, halts between two opinions; in pursuit o / peace
is found fighting all over the world, and after frantic efforts at
economy, runs up Income-tax to six shillings in the pound. John
Bull turns out Scuttle Party.
A.D. 2000. Grab Party comes in, ^rabbier than ever. Decides
that the only true Soientifio Frontier is a circle, that of the whole
globe to wit. Endeavours to "square " that circle. Other Powers
won't " come round " to this view at all. Army raised to a million
men, conscription established, "Standard" of British Navy decided
to be one ship for every twenty miles of the earth's surface. Press
applauds this idea, so do shipbuilders and engineers. Chancellor of
Exchequer resigns, and retires to Colney Hatch. Editor of Jingo
Gazette appointed in his place. Other Journals immediately " round
on" him, and oppose Grab Government. Scuttle Party revive, and
stump the country. All members of Government, except Chancellor
of Exchequer, resign. He raises Income-tax to twenty shillings in
the pound, and declares war with everybody. Is forcibly invested
with the Order of the Straight Jacket, just as five foreign Fleets and
six European Armies are on the point of starting to attack us.
A.D. 2005. Scuttle Party resumes Office. Makes terms with
foreign Armies and Fleets by promising to cut our Army down to
a few sentries and guards of honour, and our Navy to two armour-
clads, without guns, and a four-knot unarmed Cruiser. Gives up
India to Russia, Africa to Germany, puts up garrisoned fortresses
and coaling stations at Dutch auction, and lets Colonies run loose.
Conference held at Berlin as to what shall be done with England.
Turkey offers to take it under her protection, for a consideration.
Powers cannot agree on question, and Heligoland is about to annex it,
when English rise, under a popular Soap-boiler, seize leaders of Grab
and Souttle Parties, shave their heads, and make waiters of them,
banish both words from political dictionary and make a fresh start.

MR. PUNCH ON THE PINCH.
(Oh! don't we (now) know the Middleman f)
Mr. Pcnch on more than one occasion has called attention, pio-
torially and poetically, to the prejudicial influence upon commercial
prosperity of that " Incubus of Trade," the " Middleman." "Mid-
dleman 1 cry the quidnuncs, "who's he?" Some seem even
incline* to go to Betsy Prig's extremes of tart negation, and say
they " don't believe there's no sioh person." Isn't th«re? Let the
sceptics listen to the Pall Mall Gazette of the 6th of February :—
"Just now, when moat houses are feeling the pinch of the times, the
Middleman is the object of general execration. Indeed, the British Trade
Journal goes so far as to assert that if this parasite were eliminated, we
should hear very little more of trade depression. Germany and America are
said to be beating us in a great many marketB because they are shutting out the
Middlemen. Then why do our own manufacturers tolerate and even connive at
the artificial, not to say fraudulent, price which he puts upon every article
which is supplied to his order? Tbe establishment of honest direct relations
between manufacturer and consumer is the only cure for an evil which must
be grappted with sooner or later. If the producers will not move in the
matter, they deserve to suffer. A table showing the manufacturer's price
and the price paid by the consumer in leading articles, would not only be
interesting, but would facilitate the removal of the Middleman. The public
can have little idea of the extent of his impositions. The British Trade
Journal mentions one case in which a manufacturer was asked to pay nearly
double the price of an article on his invoice."
How now, incredulity P There is a Middleman, who does not
produce, who often does not even convey, who sometimes is at
scarcely any expense himself, save for a small office, and some
postage stamps, yet who intervenes superfluously hetween producer
and vendor, artificially raises prices in his own interest, manipulates
orders, and cooks invoioes, and pockets, for doing nothing but a
little adroit jockeying, a far larger per-centage of profit than either
the Manufacturer, who produces, or the Vendor, who distributes.
Why? That is precisely the question whioh requires answering.
"Why," asks the P. M. (?., most pertinently. "do our own Manu-
facturers tolerate, and even connive at," this state of things?
Well, there be wheels within wheels, and selfish power, onoe
craftily usurped, however manifestly mischievous, and obviously
irrational, is not easily shaken off by slaves of routine, and thralls of
"the custom of the Trade." If it were, many things—say butchers'
meat and felt hats, for example—might be indefinitely cheaper to
the thousands of high-rented, heavily-taxed victims of "Trade
depression."
Of course there are Middlemen and Middlemen. Against the
honest, useful Middleman, who, in the distribution of " goods" per-
forms a needed service, and takes but a fair reward, there is nothing
to be said. But the Middleman—and he abounds—who is purely a
parasite (we thank thee, P. M. O., for teaching us that word!), by the
artful aid of "artificial" and " fraudulent" prices, sucking the life
of Trade by depleting the purses both of manufacturer, retailer, and
purchaser, he, as was once said of another, and more dignified insti-
tution, is "useless, mischievous, and ought to be abolished." His
removal is the business and interest of all honest men, and fair
traders. Oermany and America, it would appear, have the start of
us in attempting that removal. If the Comparative Table, which
the P. M. O. suggests could be plainly put before the public here,
Mr. Punch opines that the days of the Parasite would be about
numbered. Speak up, long silent viotims of his merciless sucking!
Mr. Punch has ears to hear, and, at a pinch, a baton to apply.
Seasonable.—" Missions" are all the craze now in the fashionable
world. Excellent preparation for the Lenten entertainments. Not to
be behindhand, we suggest a few Missions: e.g., Mission for Theatres,
—Ad-mission. Mission for Army,—Corn-mission. Debtors'Mission,
—Owe-mission. Mission for all those who require it,—Per-mission.
Mission for bad Domestic Servants,—De-mission. Mission for Eton
boys about to be "swished," and pleading "first fault,"—Re-
mission. And, finally. Mission for Wives (according to Husbands'
view, or vice versa),—Sub-mission.
"The Unemployed." — The groups who, between twelve and
one o'clock on Sundays, stand about Public-houses with their hands
in their pockets, waiting till the doors open.

the Gallery of Illustration, when Mr. and Mrs. German Reed and
the inimitable John Parby used to delight us. Mr. Abthur Cfcil

He makes his exit as a youngish gentleman in evening dress, and

shows his "superfine cloth" evening trousers, and his spotless patent

Oh, here is a feat Britons proudly may ponder,
By Lord Charley Beresford, late of the Condor,
Who at Alexandria waked all our wonder.
Which nobody can deny I
He knew Sir Chables Wilson, by treachery sold,
Was left with his handful an island to hold,
So he set out to rescue him, ready and bold.
Which nobody can deny!
Five days they had waited, had watched day and night,
When Lord Charles's steamer hove clearly in sight.
And the vision they hailed with a shout of delight.
Which nobody can deny!
But puff! what is that? A dense volume of steam
Bnrsts forth from the boat beating bravely up stream,
And the Bight seems a damper on hope's rising gleam.
Which nobody can deny!
So friends on the island, so foes on the shore,
Conceive, and the Arabs respond with a roar,
And Sir Chables and his men think the game is all o'er,
Which nobody can deny 1
But no, not a bit of it! True they are stuck
Mid-stream, for a round-shot their boiler has struck,
And knocked a big hole in her; bit of bad luck,
Which'nobody can deny!
But Lord Charles and his crew are defiant of fear,
They have ooolness and pluck and a brave engineer;
So they set to work promptly to patoh and to clear.
Whieh nobody can deny!
Then they anchor all night, and at dawn they slip out,
To the angry surprise of the Arabs about,
Running safely the gauntlet of shot and of shout,
Which nobody can deny 1
Sir Charles Wilson's party they pick up, and go
Safe off to Gubit in despite of the foe.
Such a deed of sheer pluck sets all bosoms aglow.
Which nobody can deny!
So here's to Lord Chables in a bumper, and here
Is the health of his crew in a thunderous cheer,
With one special shout more for that brave engineer.
Whioh nobody will deny!

""Well, I never did—who would have thought to see you? Well
I am surprised," were the words that greeted me as I arrived at the
Chelsea residence of Mr. Whistler (kitchen entranoe, of course).
"Yes, it's me," was my rather terse reply.
"Wait a bit," continued he, "the Boss is out, as usual, so I '11 let
you in the front door."
In half a minute more I was standing in the peculiarly coloured
and particularly bare hall of the great Artist. Having somewhat
recovered my surprise at seeing Tom Stropping, whom I used
formerly to know as a hairdresser's assistant in the Old Kent Road,
I said, "What are you doing here?" Tom replied, "I'm Mr.
Whistler's Butler." I could have fallen with astonishment into
the hall seat, if there had been such an article of furniture present,
but there wasn't.
"Then you have given up cutting, shaving, and barbering
generally ?" I asked.
"Oh, no. I have given it up publicly—not privately. I'm Mr.
Whistler's Barber as well as his Butler. It's no sinecure
appointment either. You would not believe it possible the trouble
I nave to prevent his white lock getting black and his black hair
getting white."
"Oh! I quite believe you," I said sympathetically, and then
asked, "Is the Butler's work hard?"
"Oh, dear no," was the answer, "that's the easiest part of the
lot. You see—he never has any company. He drinks very little
wine. He laid down a bottle of Gilbey the week before last, and it
has not been opened yet. He has most of his meals out. He is a
great favourite in Society, and is seldom here."
"But how is it he is not at work on such a beautiful bright sun-
shiny day as this? One would think an Artist would give a few
years of his life for a day like this to paint by."
To mv inquiry Tom burst into a loud fit of laughter. As soon as
he could check himself, he said, "Bless you, he don't want bright
light*, or north lights to get his peculiar effects?"
"Then what lights does he want?"
"Rush-lights, was the response. "He don't want 'em still,
either. Many a time I have had to stand waggling to and fro a
rush-light with a long wick in order to get movements of shadows on
the wall. There's no doubt he do get some very jumpy results too."
I mused awhile, as is my wont, and said to Tom Stropping, "I'm
Tom said, "My boy, better late than never."
I did not comprehend the application of the remark at all, and
was ruminating whether I should say anything or not, when
Mr. "Whistler's Hairdresser and Butler said,
"Come and see them."
I was "flabbergasted," as a vulgar person would say. Tom said—
"Don't be surprised. Whistler's greatest works have never left
his studio, and are not likely to do so."
I was then escorted to the Studio—a charming place, elaborately
decorated with one peacock feather fan, and two Liberty's Japanese
plates. I saw several of the great Artist's most celebrated works.
I said to Tom, "You must explain these to me. I regret to say I
have not been educated up to them."
"Ah!" the Butler replied, "many people observe that. There is
a mystery about them—and I will solve the mystery to you. But
come and see the kitchen first." We prooeeded to the kitchen,
which was elaborately decorated in the same way as the studio,
namely, one more fan (cheaper, of course, than the other) and two
plates (ordinary) on the kitchen-dresser. There was also a pair of
"white ducks " over the baok of a chair in front of the fire. I was
told that they were being aired, as the "Boss" meditated wearing
them a little earlier this Spring than usual. It was getting rather
late in the afternoon, and a continuation of double-knocks kept
shaking up the front-door. I heard the distant voice of the Butler,
after he left me, saying "Not at home" to the Dukes, Duchesses,
Bishops, and Tax-Collectors, &c, who were paying fashionable calls.
I thought it time to leave, so made my way to the area-steps.
"Tom," I said, "tell me the mystery about these piotures."
"Certainly, my boy," he replied, "Besides being Mr. Whistler's
Butler and Hairdresser, I'm his Model for everything. I sat for the
'Portrait of a Lady.' I have sat for no end of Trunks of Trees
under the title of 'Autumnal Consecutive Fifths.' I sat for the
'Harmony in Green' (a Manchester purchaser); I sat for the
Crystal Palace Fireworks ('Fugue in Smoke'); and, lastly, but
not leastly, I always sit for that butterfly-beetle signature in the
corner of all his piotures."
I asked one more question—" Does he make much by these
pictures f"
"No," replied Tom. "He relies entirely upon the sale of his very
smart and clever Catalogues. He looks forward to a success from
his " Ten o'Clocks" ; and if they don't answer, he is going to try
(so he tells me) a " Twenty-two o'Clock."
Mrs. Ramsbotham writes:—"At my seaside lodgings I couldn't
get a wink of sleep, as there were some crumbs in the sheets, so that
I might as well have been on the bed of Piecrusty's himself."

I ADMIRE
PAPEES FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
A MATTER IN CAMERA.
I confess I was not altogether surprised to receive at my Chambers an invita-
tion from a firm of well-known West-End photographers to sit for my portrait as
a " legal celebrity." Perhaps I should have been Detter pleased had the letter
not been lithographed with uie exception of the word " legal" (which had been
filled in with a pen), as then I should nave imagined that our forensic notabilities
were not quite so numerous as the Circular seemed to suggest. "But," I argued
to myself, "the eminent operators no doubt know their business better than I
do. They are in touch, so to speak, with the Publio pulse, and must catch the
celebrity on the hop, or; as in my case, on his legs." 1 felt that they must have
heard of a recent brilliant professional triumph (I had successfully moved for
the appointment of a Reoeiver in the Probate Division of the High Court of
Justice), and anxious to meet the immense demand that must, as a consequence,
have been created for my portrait, had taken immediate steps to secure a sitting.
Thinking that perhaps the Public might%refer to see me in the costume I wear
when not engaged in wrestling with those deeply versed in the intricacies of the
Division over which Sir James Hannen so admirably presides, I offered to
appear in Mufti. But no, the eminent Firm (doubtless fully aware that the
multitude prefer to see their heroes of the hour in uniform) begged of me to
bring "my robes." Thus petitioned, I requested my clerk—to speak by the
card, my fraction of a clerk—(I share his exoellent and valuable services with
others) to fetch my wig and gown from the neighbourhood of Carey Street, as I
had need of them elsewhere. I rather think my fraction of a clerk was impressed,
imagining that I had a brief in some distant part of the country, where I was
not known.
At 11'30 a.m. I drove up with my goods and chattels (as Mr. Penley says in
the Private Secretary), and mounted to the first-floor. Here I was courteously
received by an attendant who, however, informed me that as the Artist was
engaged with " someone else," I could go into another room " and get ready."
Deprecating hurry for my sake (I felt that perhaps if the Artist knew I was
waiting for him he might spoil, in his pardonable agitation, the negative he was
then engaged in taking of either the Lord Chancellor or the Master of the
Rolls), I carried my blue bag into the apartment indicated. Here I divested
myself of my hat and necktie, and assumed a wig, a pair of bands, and a gown.
Leaving my chimney-pot sharing a settee with a
lady's bonnet and a sealskin cloak, I returned to the
room 1 had just entered, and engaged in an animated
conversation about the very considerable merits of the
specimens of photography hanging from the walls with
an agreeable female attendant. I fear that the fact that
I was "robed" rather frightened my companion, who
answered the questions I put in a tone that might have
been'adopted by a nervous witness anxious by concilia-
tory submission to end an unusually brutal line of cross-
examination. It may be that feeling my wig resting on,
not to say tickling my head, I was a little harsh when I
asked whether such and such a group "was not an en-
larged photograph?" and did they not "nowadays take
portraits the full size of life?" That our conversation was
mutually embarrassing was unquestionable, and therefore
it was a relief when the attendant, having called through
a tube that " the gentleman was quite ready, and hadn't
much time to spare," begged me to go upstairs to the
studio. 1 may remark that I was at first a little hurt (in
my character of a "legal oelebrity") at being simply
called "the gentleman," but on consideration came to
the conclusion that no doubt the anonymous description
was intended to suit the views of constitutionally timid
Queen's Counsel desirous of preserving as long as possible
their incognito.
On entering the studio I was desired to wait an instant
as the last negative was being taken of the sitter who had
preceded me. Hearing this I assumed an air of deferen-
tial hauteur so as to meet the " subject" on his retirement
(I suspected him to be the Lord Chancellor) with appro-
priate dignity. My trouble was unnecessary, as the sitter
turned out to be not the Lord Chancellor, but a much
younger lady, whose bonnet and cloak were no doubt
those I had observed in the dressing-room on my arrival.
"Now," said the Artist, after seating me somewhat un-
steadily on a chair, drawing up a curtain representing the
interior of a palace, and screwing my wig firmly on to a
frame, "I want you to look as you do when you are
questioning a witness."
This was rather perplexing, as, to tell the truth, my
work is chiefly what I may call Chamber practice.
However, I put on a scowl of intense malignity, which
seemed to me fairly suitable to the given situation.
"No, that will not do at all," exclaimed the Artist.
He spoke with a slight accent. "Think of something
pleasant."
1 did. I thought that, in spite of my considerable
Chamber practice, if I ever did have the opportunity of
examining a witness, it would be most gratifying.
"Ah, that is better!" And he took off the cover of
the camera, and "fixed" one of the broadest grins in
which 1 had indulged for years.
"Thank you," he continued, " I think that very (rood.
And now I want you to get into your ordinary attitude
in Court—when you are addressing a Judge."
Smiling gently to myself, I assumed an air of winning
candour combined with noble-minded prudence, and
leant forward with easy grace—in faot, adopting the
very attitude 1 had used in my celebrated Probate
motion.
"Oh. no—not at all I" almost shouted the Artist.
"Tou look as if you were frightened out of your life I
Something bolder will be better."
1 confess I was disappointed, as I imagined that the
Publio would have preferred to have seen their hero in
his favourite, his only attitude. However, in deference
to the suggestion that 1 should appear " bolder," I rested
my left hand upon my hip, raised my right arm
threateningly, and put on an expression that I think
would have done either for "A jax defying the Light-
ning," or " Jack Shefpard boldly conducting, at the end
of his villanous career, his own defence."
"Capital!" exolaimed the Artist.'

I thought so, too, but kept the reflection to myself.
"Have you a brief?" he asked.
This very direct question rather embarrassed me, and
1 was about to reply that I really could not say until I
had consulted my clerk, when he added that he meant
"with me."
"Oh no," I answered, quickly, and much relieved.
"All my briefs are at my Chambers."
"Well, perhaps this will do." And he gave me a song.
I objected that, if 1 were taken with a ballad in my
hand, it would savour of disrespect — that even the

celebrated Mr. Jakes Molloy, Barrister-at-Law and Composer, had
never Bung to the Court—at least not in his robes.
"Ah, it is a pity," said the Artist, falling back, and taking in my
attitude. "You look as if you wanted a brief."
I secretly agreed that I daresay I did. Then I su?gested that, if
I were given a few sheets of paper, and a piece of red tape, I might
supply him with the article he required.
"What!" he joyfully exclaimed, "can you make a dummy

I smilingly admitted that I had made such a thing—when I first
commenced practice. In a trice, Ajax and Jack Sheppabd were
supplied with a " dummy."

I was " taken " again.
With this pose my sitting terminated. In conclusion, I can only

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED PROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Thursday Night, February 19.—Parliament
met to-day after Christmas recess. No fuss with Royal Commission
or similar nonsense. Rules for admission of Members strictly carried
out, but without hitcb. Members, having given countersign at gate
of Palace Yard, conduoted across yard in couples, a policeman on

"Wake up, Sir!" Mr. Punch's Vote of Censure.
either hand. Arriving at Members' entrance, handed over to two
other policemen, a third walking behind with loaded revolver in one
hand, and a short but serviceable dirk in the other. Police gave up
their charge on entering Cloak-Room. Each Member there sepa-
rately searched in presence of Harcourt. After this, and having
signed, on oath, a declaration that he has no intention to blow up
anything but the Government, is free of the House. Usual on leaving
Cloak-Room, after being searched, to drop a sixpence, or the less
obtrusive three-penny-bit, into box at dooi labelled "Contributions
for Exploded Policemen's Fund."
Members say they like this little preliminary ceremony; but, fear
when novelty wears off, it will lead to protest. Meanwhile, Hab-
coubt hugely pleased with success of first night's experiment.
"An immense amount of responsibility and trouble, Toby," he
said, mechanically dropping his hand into my watch-pocket, which
the policeman had already searched. "But duty the first considera-
tion. Lain awake night after night thinking this matter over.
Arrived at conclusion that we were on the wrong track. Hunting
about after Irish-Americans, watching ports, and the like, all non-
sense. Thing is, keep your eye upon Members of the House and
Reporters in the Gallery. Unexpected move, eh? So are those of
all great Generals. Reporters turn rusty, and get rules abrogated
before they 're tried. But that only leaves me more time to look
after Members."
House naturally fills slowly. Process of thorough examination
can't be carried out in five minutes. But Members came in in
steady stream, and by half-past four the House was full. Only
Strangers' Gallery empty, save for half-a-dozen frightened indi-
viduals.
"Yes," said Habcoubt, looking up with a pleased smile when I
mentioned this; "we've succeeded there, at any rate. What busi-
ness Public want to know what's going on in Parliament either
through the Papers or Strangers' Gallery? I'm at the Home Office.
Let that suffice."
Everything went off quietly. No fireworks or pistol-shots. Nobth-
cote loudly oheered on rising to give notice of Vote of Censure.
Everyone glad to hear the dear old Lobd Mayor in good heart and
voice. Always stood by Northcote, and now cheers uproariously
when Sir Stafford, a little timidly, read his Resolution. Not so
much oheering when Northcote sits down. Got his Resolution a 1
in single sentence. People trying to gather what it means, so forgot
to cheer.
Gladstone in menacingly mild mood. Hopes he doesn't intrude
when he rises to offer few observations. Will not introduce any
controversial matter. Warton cries, "Oh! ob!" and a look of
pained surprise softens the lines in the face of the Good Old Man.
Tomltnson jeers. He looks at him sadly. "Et tu Brute.'"
Nothing shall draw him into retort, nor the use of bad language. If
anyone wants to pull his hair, or tweak his nose, or put his pocket-
handkerchief up the spout, now's their time. Such an exhibition of
meekness and humility never before seen.
"Butter wouldn't melt in his mouth to-night," says Georgs
Hamilton.
"May be," says Gibson, shrewdly watching the Mild Old Man.
"But I don't like the look of this. He's evidently preparing a
rouser when he comes to speak on the actual debate. 'Twas always
thus as a preliminary to passionate outburst."
Business done.—Notice of Vote of Censure.
Friday Night.—Joseph Gillis moves softly about decently
dressed in black. Joseph is like the Ministry. A Vote of Censure
is hanging over his devoted head, and Joey B., like W. E. G., affects
a subdued air. But there's a twinkle in his eye, and a twitching
about the corners of his mouth that is a little suspicious.
"What are ye smiling at, ye young dog f" says O'Shea playfully,
prodding him m the ribs.
"Well, O'Shay, between you and me, the fack is I thought the
9hot had missed fire. I took some trouble to inBult Spencer. But
it was at a small meetin' in a little village. It happened six weeks
ago, and no notice was taken in the papers. I was that mad with
rage you wouldn't have known me. Imagine me joy when I heard
Charles Lewis last night giving notice to call attention to the
speech, and reading out the very words so that they'd go through
every Newspaper in the kingdom! The worst of it is people's sayin'
Lewis and me's in league, and that I promised him something to do
this."
Fusillade of questions at Half-past Four. Tyler suddenly wakes
up, and takes under his charge Afghanistan, the route between

Mr. Mclver makes everything clear. Voild Toots.
Berber and Khartoum, communications between the Red Sea and the
Nile, not to mention the terms of the Vote of Censure. Ashmead-
Bartlett begins to grow uneasy. Never expected this of Tyler.
On Motion to go into Committee, Windbag Sexton turns up.
Members flee in affright. Makes no difference to Windbag, which
discharges itself in an hour and ten minutes, and at Half-past Ten
work begins.
Business done.—Some Votes in Supplementary Estimates.
Responsibility.
Who sends Prince Hassan? Who sends Prince Hassan?
"Not I," says Gladstoa'*, "L" says the Khedive,
"The Khedive alone, "If'you choose to believe
And he sent Prince Hassan." 'Twas I sent Prince Hassan."
Shut Up !—We learn from the Sussex Daily News that Dr. Horace
Tester has just been awarded the prize for a paper delivered before
the Students' Society of the London Dental Hospital. The subject of
the paper is " Closure of the Jaws." Let us trust this paper will be
reprinted. If widely circulated in the House of Commons, it would
surely prove to be invaluable.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
VERBECKSTRORDINARY.
We lore a Conjuror, but dread a Mesmerist. Something de-
lightful about a Conjuror, something uncanny about a Mesmerist.
M. Yerbeck is a first-rate Professor of Legerdemain, and his
prestidigitation (beautiful
word !) belongs to the
palmiest days of his art.
One of his best tricks is
the diminishing pack of
cards. How delightful it
must be to be able to do
this with tradesmen's
"little accounts."
Most people would, we
feel Bure, rather not see
the seoond part of the en-
tertainment, when, like a
Mephistopheles, he stands
in a theatrical attitude
before Mile, de M a houekit
— of course Bhe is evidently
Marguerite, in the absence
of Faust,—and sends her
off into a mesmeric swoon.
In appearance, Mile. Mar-
guerite (this must be the
name) resembles one of the
numerous photographs of
Mrs. Lahgtrt, though
which it is we cannot
exactly call to mind. When
the temporary representa-
tive of the Jersey Lily,—
who is Lady-Teazling at
the Prince's, and therefore,
except by magic, cannot be
at the Prince's Hall at the same time,—is rendered sufficiently
cataleptic, M. Yerbeck sticks a pin in her arm and makes her
throw herself into all sorts of difficult attitudes. We remember
having seen Schoolboys, not cataleptic, do much the same thing,
until after the Master had caught them attempting to stick pins into
him without having previously secured him in a mesmeric trance,
and then he became rigid, and they writhed in all sorts of extraordi-
nary attitudes for an hour afterwards.
Nothing of this mesmeric business is particularly new, and if M.
Yerbeck will take our advice, he will make the whole entertainment
consist of conjuring. He has plenty of humour, and as he only
speaks French, the requisite lightness is given to the Show by the
Interpreter, who is, quite unintentionally, a very comic man. The
audience might have understood M. Yerbeck's French "patter"
fairly enough, if the interpreter had only given them a chance; but
he wouldn't. The old-fashioned travelling Conjurors knew the secret
of making an entertainment popular when they never went about
without a Jack-pudding. That Interpreter was there to distract our
attention. Yery clever this.
Just a few sensational tricks for the second part, and a laughable
experiment or two on the Interpreter, which would send everyone
away in high good humour, and M. Yerbeck's success would be
assured at the Prince's Hall.

Mephistopheles and Marguerite at the
Prince's Hall.
MR. WHISTLER'S TEN-AND-8IXPENNY O'CLOCK.
Our Jemmt's Ten o'clock promises to go like one o'clock. The
style of his One Hour's Sermon is something between a Touchstone
and an inspired Prophet, or, at all events, of a well-versed Scripture-
Header. He is never for one moment a " Dismal J em my." He cer-
tainly "scored" at the Prince's Hall, and, as Mr. Whistler
hates being indebted to anyone, he paid off several old scores
at the same time. A certain proportion of the crowded audience
had evidently come in the expectation of seeing the McNeil stand
upon his head, but they were disappointed; the historic white lock
remained uppermost, and James, firmly planted on his feet, delivered
many well-aimed thrusts with the keen rapier of epigrammatic satire.
The Lecturer had his McNeil fling,—a well-executed pas sen I,—at
the Amateur and the Critics, and finally came down heavily, that is
by comparison, on the ./Esthetes, who, we should have thought, were,
by this time, hardly worth the trouble of setting on their feeble legs
merely for the fan of knocking them down again. In this Lecturing
Mr. J amisWhistler is " Real James" and not The Pretender. His
theories on Art and Nature may be debateable, but his power of
epigram is undoubted.
Wire from Victoria the Colohy to Victoria the Queek—

offers such advantages to its Members should be so very poorly
supported." Then he went in to hit the right nail on the head, and
that with a powerful thud. "It doubly needs your support,"
pleaded the Chairman, "in that it (the Dramatic Fund) is quiet and
unostentatious, and, I may say, to some extent unfashionable"—
excellently put Mr. Hare—"in a word it is sadly in need of
funds, and on the principle of that to 'him that hath shall be
given'" (the Chairman became a trifle mixed here, but the intention
was good) "the way of the world is too often to give not so muoh
where help is most needed, as to that charity which is most suc-
cessful,"—in fact where there can be some trumpet sounded before
the almsgiver. We sincerely hope that the immediate results
were most satisfactory, and that these vigorous observations will
stir_ up those who have given and prated of it. to give as muoh
again and to hold their tongues, and those who have given in
secret to increase their donations. Mr. Hare's tag about the
"greatest of all earthly virtues" being "charity," which he
evidently thought was a correct application of a muoh misunder-
stood scriptural text to this particular occasion, was not so happily
conceived as the earlier part of his oratorical effort, for which, as an
example of plain out-speaking, he deserves the praise of all who
are enemies of cant and snobbishness.

"I'll Strike you with, a Feather."
This song of "the great Macdf.rmott" must have inspired Sir
Stafford Northcote when he rose to give notice of his party's Vote
of Censure on the present Government. Anything more mild and
feeble was probably never heard on suoh a serious ocoasion in the
Commons House of Parliament. Sir Stafford Northcote's name
ought to be changed to Southcote—or, more properly, to Dovecote.
He is too gentle.

Upon your pleasure dangling?
Well, one can fix a boundary
As clearly as a host, Sir.

And so—here stands a Post, Sir!
LEGISLATION FOR BABIES.
Tee Isle of Man should be known henceforth as the Isle of
Mannikins. Its leading citizens—a Judge, the Speaker of the House
of Keys, the Governor's Secretary, a High Bailiff, and several
barristers—have been convicted or the fearful crime of sitting five
minutes too long in a licensed building over a dinner-table, and have
each been fined the price of a box of lollipops. A few weeks ago a
nnmber of gentlemen were dragged into the charming atmosphere of
a London Police Court for the crime of drinking a glass of champagne
at twenty-five minutes to one on the morning of New Year's Day in
a London Restaurant. If these Mannikins had been concocting a
murder, or the party of hunted London taxpayers had been active
members of the Dynamite Gang, the chances are that the Police and
the Authorities would never have known of their existence. When
hundreds of "intelligent officers" are wasted in the task of watch-
ing drinking-shops and eating-houses, we can hardly wonder at the
freedom enjoyed by Cut-throats and Destructives.
FROM OUR OWN NOBLE SPORTSMAN.
Yes, Sir, you never more conclusively realised the want of the day,
than when you said to me—
"In these hard times, what the young men of the period require,
Mr. Spottem, is a good reliable prophet.
"Sir," said I, "you have hit it; and if ever you got hold of the
round peg for the round hole, you've got it now, which my terms is
twenty-five shillings up to Epsom, and gratuities at discretion."
It's the dull season now, Sir, but when the game begins again,
I'm the man to see your clients through a cheering and lucrative
season. Why, you've benefited by the notes of the " Mouse in the
Manger," also those of the " Cat in the Cornbin" often, don't deny it
—you know you have. Those were me. I, Sir, was the Mouse; I,
Sir. was the Cat Now I'm Tippoo Sahib, the Dark 'Un! It's dull,
and the weather simply beastly—
"I would I were as I have been
In the Stewards' Stand at Ascot Green,
Sweeping my glass down the T. Y. C,
For that is the life that is meet for me."
As a would-be sporting bard sang in your columns long since. He
wasn't muoh in it. "Sweeping your Glass down." I flatter myself
I understand that as well as any man in England, but why he intro-
. dueed T. Y. C, by which I presume he means Thames Yacht Club,
I into a racing lyric, can only be explained by his being rather beaten
There I go, you see, I'm
qq allow valuable
off for a rhyme—otherwise it's a paradox.
so full of information that I keep bubbling over, am
stable secrets to escape me in my meltm moments. There I am
again. Why, there's two hints for any man who knows "a hawk
from a hand-Baw," which Hamlet didn't, nor I think The Leviathan
Williams when he wrote that line. He understood " sweeping his
glass," did Leviathan Williams.
You see I appreciate Shakspeare by calling him " The Leviathan."
Did it ever strike you, Sir, before, to what race the original Leviathan
belonged? If there were a Levi in my name, I should consider
myself own brother to Sir Moses. I think the " n " was left out of
Leviathan; it should have been Levi-Nathan. Deep sea-fish that!
Now, Sir, to get out of the Mosaics, and back to horse-racing. I
hope your readers will understand it's five-and-twenty shillings
up to Epsom. Extra for that meeting, because that sets 'em up for
the season. Yours respectfuBy,
Robebt Spottem (professionally, "Tlppoo Sahib,"
the Dark 'Un).
P.S.—Perhaps you wouldn't mind enclosing some of my circulars
in your invaluable paper.*
* Of course we don't mean to comply with this modest request, but, if put to
it, we'd rather do this than accept any of Tippoo's "invaluable paper."—Ed.
MR. PIPS IN THE GALLERY.
A Diary of Two Parliaments, by Henby Ltjct, is a Diary well
worth keeping. For sustained interest a modern novel isn't on the
same bookshelf with it. It is " not too dramatic, but just dramatic
enough," as Mr. Lionel Bbot/qh is perpetually saying in The Babes;
and though at the very commencement, on meeting with the old fami-
liar names of Disbaeli, Robebt Lowe, and Knatchbull-Htjouessen,
we are perfectly well aware that they will respectively turn out to be
the Earl of Beaconsfield, Lord Shebbbooke, and Lord Bbaybbooke,
yet their sayings and doings are as fresh as ever, and the dtnoument
comes upon the most blase reader with all the effect of an artistically-
arranged surprise.
So for the account of the mighty quarrel between Messrs. Vernon
HABCorrBT and Gladstone, when the Pipsian Diarist in the GaUery
thought that these two could never speak to one another amicably
again, which only whets our ouriosity to know how they subse-
quently determined to "kiss and be friends," and united in one
Cabinet to live happily ever afterwards. Such episodes as these,
related in the pleasantest possible manner,—though, by the way, the
Members immortalised as "stupid" and "failures" will not take
the same view of Mr. Lucy's book as we do,—make us regret that all
historical diaries are not as clear, that is as Luoy'd, as this.

A Contemporary, in the course of a recent notice of Mr. J. H. Ingram's
new and entertaining Volume on the subject of the " Haunted Houses" of Great
Britain, haying expressed its conviction that, owing to the prevailing taste for
mysticism, this formerly ineligible olass of property was now positively ooming
to be sought for and in much request, the Society for Psychical Research has,
as might have been anticipated, lost no time in meeting a public demand in a
oongenial spirit, and have at onoe opened a temporary Agency at their central
offices. Subjoined is a'specimen of their Preliminary "List" for the
month.
MESSRS. EDMUND GURNEY & CO., Haunted House and Estate
Agents, respeotfully beg to offer to the notice of their various Clients
the following desirable Properties, selected from many others at present standing
on their books for disposal.
GLAMORGANSHIRE (in the very worst part of), seventeen miles and
a half from a station, delightfully situated, overlooking an ancient grave-
yard,'and within two minutes' walk of a subterranean passage of the adjacent
ruined church crypt, a thoroughly first-class crumbling old-fashioned English
Mansion, in excellent mysterious condition, and furnished with every modern
psychical convenience. Contains several handsomely proportioned reception-
rooms, all, owing to spiritual manifestations, perfectly intolerable after dusk,
a picture-gallery, in which the famous "black hound" of the Poynings, the
original holders of the estate, appear* on the eve and morrow of great dinner
parties, or the approach of any grave disaster to the local postmaster, and
twenty-five sleeping apartments, in all of which, due to the continued noise as
of a large iron beer-barrel filled with bricks, rolling from midnight till half-past
five a.m. all over the floors and ceilings, any approach to rest is found to be
practically impossible. The House is at present let. but the remainder of the
lease would be parted with on the spot for a nominal premium, and immediate
possession given in consequence of the desire of the present occupiers to pass the
summer months in a lunatic asylum. Drainage perfect. (17,341.)
G
ALLOWSHUR8T. — This unique, charming, and agreeably Haunted
Little Hunting Box to be disposed of
Nine rooms, stabling, capital
Thirteen Packs, five Spectral, meet in immediate neigh-
bourhood. Handsome carved oak staircase (reign of
James the First), down whioh, from the top to the
bottom (eight flights) a Warrior, in full chain armour,
is heard to roll heavily, head-over-heels, at midnight,
on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, finally disap-
pearing with a series of loud unearthly wails in the wine-
cellar. A Tenant with several rich, but nervous relatives,
from whom he has expectations, or one desirous of good-
humouredly enlivening the country visits of his friends,
would find this an eligible investment. Doctor within
eighty-five minutes. Price of Freehold, £25. (19,310.)
ACHARMING BIJOU VILLA RESIDENCE, most
tastefully decorated and haunted throughout, To
be Let immediately. Newest style of Queen Anne
furniture, with exquisitely finished Library and Boudoir
to match, in which precisely at a quarter to nine every
evening, a little man in the dress of the last century,
wearing a blue velvet coat and bag-wig, and with a
troubled expression of countenance, holding his head
under his arm, appears, and says, in a melancholy voice,
"I tcish I hadn't forgot it," and then seems to disappear
up the chimney. Further particulars on application.
(20,191).
/CYPRESS HO! BRIXTON RISE—This comfort-
v_7 ably-appointed and well-constructed Family resi-
dence to be Let on Lease. Fifteen rooms. Stabling if
required. The Premises present unusual psychical
advantages to a Tenant in any pecuniary embarrassment,
there being the Spectre of a Female in White, holding a
murdered child in one hand and two carving-knives in
the other, permanently standing on the mat in the middle
of the entrance-hall. The Spectre is so visible, that no
Tradesman making application for his account, and pur-
posely admitted, has ever been known either to smile or
oall again. References can be had from the Local
Clergyman, and several highly respectable people living
in the immediate neighbourhood, who have been re-
peatedly frightened into fits. Large Kitchen Garden,
well stocked with evil spirits. The entire Premises
to be had a bargain, with or without possession. Good
opportunity for newly-married couple of position wishing
to economise. Ghost and fixtures might be taken at a
valuation. (22,134.)
BOGEY PARK MANSIONS. — Portions of these
elegantly-fitted modern residences to be let out
in any quantity to flats on application. As they have
been constructed on scientific psychical principles, more
especially to meet the necessities of medium-sized
families, they have been roofed with self-writing slates,
provided with automatic rapping doors, and telopathic
communication with the principal theosophic centres,
and plaoed under the charge of a floating hall-porter
entirely independent of the laws of Matter. An Elevator
and Depressor on the premises. For Prospectus and terms
apply to the Manager. (24,191.)
PORTLAND PLACE, W.-One of the largest of
_ these famous and fashionable town houses to be let
furnished for the ooming season. It comprises the usual
reception and bed rooms, including an excellently-haunted
guest-chamber, the occupant of which having once entered
it to dress for dinner ts never seen or heard of again.
A County M.P. who is expected to show some civility to
a numerous following oi influential but cantankerous
Constituents, would find the above a highly-desirable re-
sidence for his purpose during the progress of the Parlia-
mentary Session. If taken for more than one
terms moderate. (13,044.)
MIDNIGHT GRANGE.—This snug and oharming
little thirteen-roomed Country Residence To be
Let, with immediate possession. No occasion to burn
gas or candles, the entire residence being illuminated
after dark by the flitting speotres of a Quaker, three
men in cloaks, a headless woman on horseback followed
by an Alderman, who move continually from room to
room, uttering loud yells from dusk to daybreak. Would
offer advantages as a Private Deaf and Dumb Asylum,
or might be turned to excellent account by an invalid
and aged couple anxious to enjoy the experience of a
little genuine romance and excitement at a comparatively
trifling cost. Application to view to be made between
* 'of one and two a.m. on the premises. Key
Ghost. (29,139.)

OLD MASTERS' EXHIBITION. VISIT OF YOUNG MASTERS.
"WHERE IGNORANCE IS BLISS," &c.
That not particularly learned body which rejoices in the name of
the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London, held a Special
Meeting at the Guildhall last week, to discuss the terribly extrava-
gant conduct of the London School Board in adding one penny in the
pound to the amount of the rate to be levied in the wealthy City of
London for the ensuing rear. Much burning eloqnenoe, of the pecu-
liar City type, was used on the occasion, and a statement by one
highly excited member that there were no less than 313 Board
Sob ools in the Metropolis in which the great work of education was
being successfully carried on, and that the ory was still for more,
was received with as terrible a groan of horror as if it had been
announced, on authority, that there were to be no more " Cakes and
Ale" for the Sewage Commissioners.
In vain was it stated by those who, apparently, love light rather
than darkness, that whereas the population of London some ten or
twenty years ago was one of the most ignorant of any capital of
Europe, it was now, thanks to the School Board, assuming its proper
place in this respect, by giving all its children a good education,
they were met by a shout of derision by an angry Commissioner, who
demanded to know "why they didn't try to teach a cow to win the
Derby," which brilliant interrogation elicited great applause.
In vain did one member, who spoke with authority, ridicule the
idea of printing the receipts for this particular rate in letters of red,
by suggesting, in tones of blighting sarcasm, that they had better
''print them with a pen of iron on the adamantine tablets of the
universe."
In vain was it suggested that this sudden affectation of sympathy
with the poor Rate Payer for having to pay this additional penny for
education, was but a blind to screen their own increased rate of
double the amount, for a purpose of not one-tenth the importance,
and that it was scarcely creditable to the representatives of the
wealthiest constituency in the world, to grumble at a rate that was
borne ungrudgingly and uncomplainingly by the poor Rate Payers of
Bermondsey and Bethnal Green, the Sewage Commissioners listened
with impatience, reserving their enthusiastic approbation for the
very demonstrative gentleman who addressed them after their own
heart; and in language that all could understand and thoroughly
sympathise with. He was quite willing, generous soul, that the poor
children should have bread, but what he objected to was ramp-
steaks! and he concluded his brilliant oration with the following
magnificent peroration:—" Everybody should have his meal, but he
must have a stomach of the highest class before they could give him
turtle soup and port wine t"
Who but a member of the City Corporation could have contrived,
when discussing the question of the education of the Poor, to have
brought in those two gods of his idolatry, turtle soup and port wine!
And in combination, too! Oh, Robert, Robert, Prince of Waiters t
how must thy very soul shudder to read it, and that the awful
thought was conceived, too, by one of that body whom you so con-
stantly hold up to public admiration, and pnbbo imitation, as the
greatest living authority upon that most important of all important
subjects—the Art of Dining.

MUCH ADO.
A propos of the Theatrioal Doveoot fluttered by the article in last
month's Fortnightly, the Editor of The Theatre has correctly pointed
out that the author of that article did not originate the excitement,
but that it was commenced by what we at the time called the
"Kendal-light" thrown on the Stage by the unlucky Brummagem
discourse. To adapt the opening sentence of Chahles Dickens's
Cricket on the Hearth, we may substitute " Kendal" for " Kettle,"
and say " Kendal began it,"—not " Mister," but " Missis."
The faot is, there ought to be no more necessity for showing that
the Stage is not a profession on the same level with the recognised
professions, than there is to demonstrate that two and two make
four. The occasion only arises when some ambitious individual
claims for two and two a result beyond the limit assigned to those
quantities by an inexorable arithmetic.
Every article that we have seen intended as an answer to " Behind
the Scenes," in the Fortnightly for January, has gone wide of the
mark, and has generally '' answered" something that the article
never stated. Of oourse it is evident that, constituted as society is,
the " profession" of any art, or of journalism, cannot be on an
equality with the recognised professions. Were the nobility to
invade the Stage, did Dukes take to "utility," if Duchesses became
"leading Ladies," and Countesses "singing chambermaids," the
question of social position would not be in the least affected, and the
Stage would be no more on a level with the recognised Professions,
on account of the rank of its individual members, than it is now on
the score of the exemplary blamelessness of the Actors' private lives,
or of their wealth, or of their perfect courtesy, or of their large-
heartedness and unostentatious generosity.
When it was announced that Prince Edward of "Wales was to be
made a Bencher of the Middle Temple, the Timet congratulated His
Royal Highness on associating himself with the Legal Profession,
"so indispensable to mankind, and so great in itself," and showed
how justly proud England, for hundreds of years, has been of her
Bar, and how gratified the young Prince might well feel on becoming
a member of so distinguished a Body. Now, if the hypothesis could be
granted that the Stage is on an equality with the Bar, then we might
hear of one of the youthful Princes announcing his intention of
becoming an Actor, and of entering himself as a Member of one of the
principal London Theatrical Companies; and further, the Times, as
representing the popular voice, would congratulate his Royal High-
ness, on "associating himself with the Histrionic Profession, of
which England has for centuries been so justly proud," and so forth.
Quod est absurdum. Why should histrionic apologists rage, on
being brought face to face with facts which the sensible ones of " the
profession" are perfectly willing to admit?
By the way, the 8tage can boast of one Emperor who went on the
boards, and was eminently successful as an Aotor, Author, Singer,
Composer, and finally Cirous performer. He certainly had a plea-
sant way of disposing of all rivals and of silencing every adverse
oritio by the simple process of instantaneous decapitation. Don't
most of us envy him suoh a power? The man who hadn't sense
enough in his head to appland his Emperor was evidently unfit to
have a head at all, and consequently off it went. This Imperial His-
trion's name wos.Neko. A most accomplished scoundrel; but he did
not effect much towards "elevating the Drama," or raising "the
sooial status of the Actor," which social status is, and always will be,
just exactly what the Artist, be he Actor, Painter, Composer, or
Author, may ohoose to make it for himself.
BRITISH BABOOS.
It is a notorious fact that, for some mysterious reason or other, the
gentleman who represented the Times at Calcutta, no less than his
Editorial employer, who directs the destinies of that frisky but un-
fathomable journal in Printing House Square assumed a painfully
gloomy, and, on several occasions, a really depreasingly ill-tempered
attitude towards the late Vicerojr of India. This, nowever, was
ohiefly_ noticeable during the period of his able and successful
administration of the duties of his office, for, beyond indulging in a
little natural yelp now and then at his Lordship's heels, the leading
journal has, since Lord Ripon's return to this country, treated him
with a sufficient, if sulky respect. This is, of course, as it should
be, for the Times is—well, the Times. But why should somebody,
signing himself "J. M. Maclean," have anything to say on the
subject? Who is Mr. Maclean?
It is true that he informs the public not only that he was once a
member of a Club called the "Northbrook," but that in a fit of
chagrin with some unhappy Committee that had asked Lord Rifon
to dinner, he had taken his name off the books. Still this is scarcely
Imperial intelligence, and worthy of being set up in type. Even less
worthy of publication is the following. Referring to the well-
deserved ovation that has greeted Lord Ripon on bis return to this
country, Mr. Maclean is allowed to remark that—
"Day after day and week after week, with a wondrous self-complacency,
he sings his own praises as not a statesman merely, but a hero ana a saint,
while the part of chorus is performed by the well-trained school of Radical
politicians whose main business in lifo appears to be to vilify English rule
and destroy English ascendency in every corner of the earth."
Coming from any influential quarter the above would be almost, if
not quite impertinent. As it stands it is both humorous and harm-
less, being only noticeable at all as an indication of the extreme un-
fitness for all loyally Imperial legislation that characterises the
majority of those retired dyspeptics who are highly respected—at
least by each other—under the generic appellation of "Anglo-
Indians." Had Mr. Punch time and space to spare, he would like
to say a strong word or two to these self-sufficient gentlemen con-
cerning the intellectual estimate they have formed of their brother
subject of Her Most Gracious Majesty, "The Nigger." If it be
"rank radicalism" to civilise, to elevate, and finally to emancipate
our fellow-men from all disabilities whatever, then is Mr. Punch,
in company with the late distinguished Yiceroy of India, the very
rankest of rank Radicals.
GENERAL SIR HERBERT STEWART.
Born June 30, 1843; wounded in Jight near Hetcmneh, January 19, 1885;
died at Gakdul, February 16, 1885.
Young, gallant, sage in counoil. swift in fight,
O'er a bright day falls a too early night.
The tears that from his comrades' eyes fast feU,
In that small graveyard by the Gakdul well,
Are such a tribute to a brave man slain
As heroes live to earn, and gladly die to gain.
ENCOURAGEMENT.
Her Gracious Majesty addressed a few heart-stirring words to
her Grenadier Guards at Windsor on the eve of their departure,
and told them how confident she was that they would " ever maintain
the honour and reputation of British Soldiers." In the parallel
column of the Daily ChronicU^in which this report appeared, there
was a paragraph headed " Our Warriors' Wives, informing us "that
the soldiers' wives and ohildren hod been ordered out of barracks,"
that they had an allowance respectively of 8<f. and 2d. ahead a day,
and that mostly without friends or relations, they were to all intents
and purposes temporarily homeless. Her Gracious Majesty's eyes
must have lighted on this report, so that we may hope that this
cruel and stupid wrong has been repaired long before these lines
appear, for it would be a disgrace to us all, from the highest to the
lowest, if while our Soldiers, to quote the Queen's words, are
"maintaining the honour and reputation " of our Army abroad, we
were doing nothing to maintain their wives and ohildren at home.
To know that no oare would be taken of the wives, the boys, and
"girls they leave behind them," would be a nice thing pour en-
courager les autres.

"HE '8 ALWAYS TRYING TO EAT MY BOOTS. He EVIDENTLY THINKS THERE '8
SOME CHANCE OF GETTING AT A LITTLE CORN!"
FROM OUR OWN NOBLE SPORTSMAN.
No, Sir! don't, pray, be led away by a man like Pick Periwink. The idea of
Ms suggesting that he would serve you better than ME. No, there are prophets
and prophets; there are the profitless prophets for instance. Pick has made his
living in that line for many years, and disposed of as much unreliable informa-
tion as any impostor in the profession. A low man, Sir. A man of no educa-
tion, whose epitaph of " Hicjacet" requires no further addition, as Mr. Nowell
says. "Hear lies," is comprehensive, and describes Pick accurately. But enough
of such rubbish as Peri wink; the game is about to begin again, and Sportsmen
will have an opportunity of seeing whether there is most wind or wind-mills at
Lincoln ere many weeks are over. Let them only stick to old Bob and they '11
bring grist to their mills anyway.
The acceptances of the Lincoln Handicap are out, and those of the early bettors
on that race will be out also by the end of next month. Now, Sir, tell your young
friends, if they 've'never been to Lincoln, never to go. Losing your money in a
bitter Nor-Easter isn't good enough, and bless you, this is a bookmakers' race.
The Knights of the Pencil, Sir, hold that backers, like pike, are more ravenous
in keen weather, and consequently easier to land. No, Sir, easy does it. Take
my advice and eschew the Boulevard for the present, and remember that an early
display of Energy has already proved a mistake.
Wait till the clouds roll by," Sir! Sunshine and champagne is the sort of
atmosphere to back winners in. Ha, Sir, what a time we '11 have at Ascot! 1
am looking forward to the lunch which I understand you always provide at the
back of the Stand for the Staff of yonr celebrated weekly. The early strawberries,
the Pommery of '74 (blended with '75 isn't bad, and '80 is not to be sneezed at.
By the way, ever tried Lanson '74? "Well, if you can get it, bring it to Ascot),
the pales de foxes gras, the Perigord pies, &c., and our note-cases all stuffed to
repletion. Bless you, I see it all. I seem to see you with that wink in your
right eye, and your finger on your somewhat-prominent nose, trolling out as we
dink glasses:—
"Says the young Obadiah to the old Obadiah,

I'll put your readers on good things and manage their little "corns" for
'em with pleasure. "Why, Sir, with a view of giving
my whole mind to your business, and on the strength
of the large subscription list doubtless at present in your
hands (it's only five-and-twenty shillings up to Epsom
remember,) I was looking for a quiet residenoe in the
neighbourhood of Regent's Park the other day. I saw an
untenanted house with a notice on the door referring, as
I supposed, to the agents in whose hands the letting was
placed. I went through the little garden to see, and found

CHARACTER OF THE UN-HAPPY WARRIOR.
A Pendant to Wordsworth's lately much-quoted
"Happy Warrior."
Who is the Unhappy "Warrior? Who is he
"Whom every Party man appears to be P
—It is the ungenerous spirit, who, when brought
Among the tasks of national life, bath wrought
On plans from pigeon-holes parochial brought:
"Whose sole endeavour is in faction's fight
To prove his faction always in the right;
Who, with no natural instinct to discern
The noble, is not diligent to learn;
Abides by Party needs, and stops not there,
. But makes its pettiest dodges his prime care;
"Who, doomed his conscience cruelly to strain
"With faotion's followers—miserable train!—
Turns its necessities to private gain F
—'Tis he whose law's unreason, who depends
On sophistry as on the best of friends;
"Whence, in a State where men are tempted still
By wordy flux that hides molluscous will,
Where muddled notions rule the worst and best,
And all things on a sand-foundation rest,
He fixes good on self alone which shows
No other guide to follow save its nose.
—"Who, if he rise to station of command,
Rises bv servile means; and there will stand
Like a Praetorian Caesar, whose desire
In power finds its sole inspiring fire.
"Who worships Number One, and to the same
Keeps faithful with pure singleness of aim;
And therefore stoops, and creeps, and lies in wait
For wealth, and honours, and nigh worldly state.
The guerdons which, like showers of manna fall
On those whose knees are callous, and can crawl,
"Whose powers shed round him in hot Party strife
Or the concerns of Parliamentary life,
Bellicose blague no snubbings can abase;
But who, if he be oalled upon to face
Some crisis, awful to the base or blind.
Calling for lofty heart or spacious mind,
Is helpless as an oyster, fogged and mired,
By peril dazed, by duty uninspired;
Who, through the heat of confliot, can but "jaw"
Of what he dares not front, and ne'er foresaw.
— He who, though dowered with a double sense,
For twaddling tame, and rowdy turbulence,
Lacks the cool sense on which high policy leans,
And splutter lends, not strength, to Party " soenes."
Sheer windbag! vain and void, where'er he be,
Of manners and of magnanimity,
His darling joy to rail at and reprove
The generous souls mean malice may not love:
'Tis, finally, the man, who, lifted high,—
He could tell how, but no one can tell why—
Or hotly fuming in obscurity,
Plays, 'midst the many games of life, that one
"Whose leading rule is " Do, and don t be done;"
"Whom neither thoughts of " Dirty Trioks " dismay,
Nor promptings high to chivalry betray,
"Who not content to see great worth stand fast,
"Will snatch a mean advanl age j ust to cast
Opprobrium on the foe he'd brand or blast.
Who, howsoever long he stalk the earth,
Never to noble thought or deed gives birth,
And so goes down to dust without fair fame
Leaving a dead unprofitable name;
Not having helped one high or holy cause,
Or earned man's gratitude or Heaven's applause.
This is the Unhappy Warrior; this is he
Whom every honest man should scorn to be.

A DERBY PROPHECY.
Does Lord Derby, after all. mean to meet the patriotic enthusiasm
of our Colonies with the chilly douche of unsympathetio dawdling
ending in a practical "declined with thanks?" If so, his charac-
teristic administration of cold water to "My Boys "will get him
into hot water with Mr. Punch, who is proud, and the English
People, who are fond of them.
Always the same, Derby my own,
Alwavs the same, and as cold as a stone!
But if he offers a stone, of official callousness, instead of the hread
of sympathetic thanks to Our Boys in Australia and elsewhere, Mr.
Punch prophesies that we shall soon "lose the Derby," which,
though a prodigious misfortune of course, would be a far less one
than failing to win the blue riband—in other words the affection
and confidence—of the British Race beyond Seas.
"WHAT'S IN A NAME?"
The Poet Laureate, speaking of
"The grand old name of gentleman,"
indignantly describes it as being
"Soiled with all ignoble use."
Another noble name—that of the heroic and devoted Gordon—is
at the present moment being used ignobly and to ignoble ends by
the aU-oorrupting spirit of Party. Mean it was to use it as the
scapegoat of a dUoredited Policy. Equally mean is it to use it as
a weapon of party malice. "Ignoble uses " both, and though they
cannot soil the name so traded on, they soil the reputation of the
paltry traders on that name. The hero of Khartoum did not leave
that name to trick out a tale of calculated " indignation," or to point
an interested party moral, but to inspire ns with the spirit Ms
hysterical eulogists seem unable to rise to—the spirit of unselfish
chivalry and patriotic devotion.
THE PRINCE'S DAY.
[After Moore.)
[It is announced that the Trince and Princess of Walks are to visit Ireland
in April.]
HlBERNIA
Though dark be our sorrows, to-day we 'll forget them,
For sunlight will come with the Season of Showers.
There never were hearts, would our rulers but let them,
More.inclined to be loyal and jolly than ours.
The old galling chain
Has not yet ceased to pain,
But new shackles of love wiU be light, wreathed with'flowers.
There comes a new link,
And our hearts wiU not shrink,
When they oross the wide water between us that rolls.
Sure we 'U welcome their advent, and lengthen their stay.
And if loyalty's spark have burned down in our souls,
Let us light it up fresh on our Prince's Day!
They are less than half right who declare us disloyal!
Though fierce to our foes, to our friends we are true,—
Free tribute we 'U pay to a pair rightly royal
The tribute of love that is liberty too.
Cruel cowards who blight
Erin's fame are not right
When they paint her a-blaze for the battle array.
The Island of Green
In Spring's sun shall be seen
An Arcadia of peace when our Princess stops in it.
To cast every bitter remembranoe away
Is work for long years, and not done in a minute,—
But at least let's begin on onr Prince's Day!
He '11 love our Green Isle! Can his Crown have afforded
Its emerald jewel so long to forget?

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, February 23.—Another Vote
of Censure. Forget how many this makes, but performance doesn't
seem to lose attractiveness with public. House filled to-night for
first time since Session resumed. Strangers' Gallery, and Speakers'
too, crowded. Proceedings not very lively. Poor Sir Stafford
Northcotb sacrificed himself, as he's always willing to do, and
delivered dreary speech an hour long.
"I 'm sick to death, Toby," he said, when it was over, "at this
dreary round of moving Votes of Censure. I wish I could change
places with Gladstone and be censured instead of censuring. They
seem to thrive upon it, and we to decay."
Gladstone quite oheery, and as usual righteously angry with Sir
Stafford. Spoke through dinner-hour, upsetting many social

Agile 0. if. (to himself). "Very nearly ' too lato' again! Just my luck!"
(Sup. 113.)
arrangements. Pretty to see Members distraught between dinner
and duty ; majority manfully sat it out. When Gladstone sat down,
universal rush for dining-room. Db Worms (who carries about with
him his own Diet), came next, and addressed the Benches with great
animation. Later, Colonel Dawnat took up his parable, warning the
Government not to send an army to Khartoum, where, with the hot
season approaching, they will surely perish.
"Why, bless me, Dawnat," I said, "I remember a speech yon
made early in May last denouncing the Government for not
dispatching an expedition to Khartoum at the end of March, when
they first heard the town was invested, and accusing them of
abandoning the gallant Gordon. Now in February, a month
earlier, when they are on the spot, within a fortnight's march of
Khartoum, you warn the Government not to order the troops forward
on pain of absolute destruction! What do you mean?"
"Toby," said the Colonel, "you're a nice dog, but you weren't
born to shine in politios."
Materials for a row gathered together below Gangway. Ulster
Members quarrelled with their leaders, and gone to sit below the
Gangway amongst the Parnellites. Peaceable inhabitants of that
part of the House, like Hubbard, cleared out and watch the results
from afar. Charles Lewis proposes some Wednesday afternoon to
have rehearsal of celebration of closing of gates at Derry. Shillelagh
practice nightly going on, in view of contingencies.
"Thought you'd volunteered for the Soudan, Nolan," said Henry
Havelock, revisiting old familiar scents. "Heard you were getting
tired of home servioe."
"Meant to go," said Nolan. "Yearn to depart; but Party have
asked me to conduct operations here, and, however unwillingly, must
stay."
Business done.—Vote of Censure moved.
Tuesday Night.—A pretty row to-night. Proposed in high
quarters to continue debate on Vote of Censure. Goschen to re-
sume discussion as soon after five as possible. House filled, and
expectant of utterances of Oracle. Oracle carefully dressed, seated
in usual place, waiting opportunity. Questions over, Gladstone
furtively rose, and, with nod and wink at Speaker, mumbled a few
words. As matter of fact, this was a Motion that Resumed Debate on
Vote of Censure should take precedence over Notices of Motion. But
if Wily Old Man thought this would pass without notice, mistaken.
John Redmond had placed on paper notice to call attention to case
of Inspector Murphy, of Irish Constabulary Force. What was
Vote of Censure to this f What the fate of the Government, or the
course of Imperial policy?
8pbaker evidently on the alert; not going to stand any nonsense.
Pulled up Redmond as soon as he strayed from paths of order.
Redmond boldly strayed again. Again pulled up. Offended third
time, and. received third warning, ttuite safe thus far, but after
third warning business begins. Valour had had its turn. Discretion
claimed attention, and Redmond shut up.
Nevertheless speech-making went forward. Parnellite to Parnel-
lite succeeded. Junius Bbutus Redmond (for Heaven has been
bounteous to the House of Commons, and there are two Redmonds)
strutted on to stage with careless grace and 'aughty air. Extin-
guished with swift and comical effect.
"I am glad—ha! ha!—Mr. Speaker." he said, in deep chest
notes, and sweeping baok with blood-curdling gesture his free-born
locks, "that—ho! no !—Dublin Castle is irrelevant."
"I must ask the Hon. Member to discontinue his speech," said the
Speaker quietly, and Junius Brutus dropped limply into his seat
as Sim Tappertit used to subside when the eye of the burly Lock-
smith fell upon him.
Speechifying still going on. Speaker played trump card.
"I consider this subjeot," he said, has been adequately
discussed, and that it is the evident sense of the House that the
question should be put."
A moment's pause at this unexpected bolt out of the blue; then a
roar of impotent rage from Parnellites. O'Brien, bounding on seat
like india-rubber ball, bellowed out—"We'll remember this in
Ireland!" Speaker down on him like a Bhot.
"I name you, Mr. O'Brien, for disregarding the authority of the
Chair."
Gladstone on Treasury Bench, fumbling over Orders in search
of terms of Resolution on Cloture; now off on fresh tack; must
move that O'Brien be suspended. Howls incessant from Irish
camp; Strangers in Gallery standing on feet, craning their necks
to look over at turbulent scene; white-necktied attendants wildly
waving arms; Gladstone at table, trying to move Resolution;
Sexton bellowing out something inaudible above the din; Junius
Brutus arranging his hair in fresh style, suitable for the occasion;
Speaker on his feet, vainly crying, " Order! order J" At length
Division taken, and, out of chaos, O'Brien delivered into Lobby.
Row broke out afresh on Motion for Cloture. Speaker put ques-
tion in wrong way; House cleared for Division; bells ringing far and
near; Members tumbling in through Lobby. House being cleared
for Division, no one must address the Speaker except seated and
with hat on. Gorst remembers this; comes up to empty front
Opposition Bench, and. pressing hat over brows, orates at length.

Gorstut Chathamus and Wolffus Portsmouthut (together). "Oh for one
hour of Randolph!"
Arthur O'Connor, taking the one, seats himself, puts on hat, and
begins a speech. Parnell does the same. In all parts of the House
hats are wagging towards the Chair, and everybody is muting a
speeoh at the hapless Speaker.
This also put right, and Division called. Gladstone, deploring;
waste of time, takes opportunity to go off to his room to write letter.

Thursday. — House of Lords crammed to-night. Evidently
something up.
"Burnnam Wood has come to Dunsinane," said Lord Gbanvtlle,
smiling upon crowd of Commoners, who struggled for places in the
galleries over the Bar, and on the space before the Throne.
Ladies thronged the galleries on either side; Strangers' Galleries
chock full; in fact, only place where there was sitting room was on
the Benches allotted to supporters of Her Majesty's Government.
All this because Markiss going to move Vote of Censure. This done
in speech of (treat" vigour, hugely cheered. Nobthbbook enabled
House to imagine what Mahdi would be like when he's smashed.
So depressed as to be sometimes inaudible. Made one good point
about Hicks Pasha's troops.
"If they'd only stood attack of Soudanese," he said, "they'd

Lords.
Bkabouknk (whose face, Watebpobd says, always reminds him of
a weasel) more than ever melancholy at necessity conscience imposed
upon him of voting against the Minister who, yielding to his
solicitations, made him a Peer. But conscience first, natural feelings
after. Having wiped away a tear, Bbaboubne savagely went for
his old colleagues, excelling all others in imputing to them mean-
ness, treachery, cowardice, and general stupidity.
"I don't think it will do." said Lord Cobk, meditatively shak-
ing his head; "we made Knatchbull-Hugessen a Baron, and
having got all that seemed possible, he turned and bit the hand that
befriended him. If they make him a Viscount, he '11 turn on them.
Besides, the Markiss, whatever we may say of him, is a man capable
of infinite scorn."
Business done,—Both Houses pegging away at Vote of Censure.
Saturday, 2"30 a.m.—Divisions just over. Government saved by
■kin of their teeth. Everybody cheering. Victors and vanquished.
Parnellites, by exception, a little quiet.
"Thought we had them this time," said Tm Hbaly. "It 's hard
to be so near and yet so far."
Joseph Gillis going to his locker for his muffler previous to
walking- home, met black-bearded stranger.
"Joseph Gillis, I presume?" said the Stranger, d la Stanley
and Dr. Livingstone.
"1 believe so," said Joey B, cautious to the last.
"And to think," said Black Beard, "that with fifteen more votes
like yours, Gladstone would have fallen, and I would have been in
power!"
Stranger strode away, and Joseph, hastily feeling in his pockets
and finding his watch and purse safe, wrapped his muffler round his
neck, and so home.
Business done.—Vote of Censure defeated by 302 votes to 288.

Sib,—If one were to strive to imagine the most awful combina-
tion of horrors that could be inflicted upon a sensitive man of
unblemished descent and highly-cultivated taste, it would be being
compelled to enter one of these instruments of torture, on a very
wet day, when ten passengers, of full average proportions, are seated,
five on each side, not one of whom seems to have the slightest idea
that you are looking wildly for a seat, where seat, apparently, there
is none. I am, Sir, rather short than tall, and have to make frantic
efforts to save myself from falling into somebody's lap, by endea-
vouring to grasp the loose strap that hanfjs suspended from on high.
In doing so, my streaming umbrella deposits its superfluous moisture
on some one who naturally resents its unwelcome addition to his
already sufficiently saturated trousers, and in turning round to
apologise, my weeping umbrella encounters another passenger, who
possibly uses profane language, and I at length find myself deposited,
by a sudden start of the Omnibus, right on to the lap of a stout lady,
who resents my intrusion by placing her saturated umbrella between
us, the damp from which I shortly feel to be penetrating my trousers
with such a deadly chill as promises a splendid specimen of oough,
or catarrh, or both, to Yours &c,
MAYnrrr.TAN PrEBBEPOINT.
Sra,—I am compelled by circumstances to travel daily by public
conveyances—Omnibuses generally. Try to fancy what I, a nervous
man, have to endure. For some wonderful reason I have never been
able to fathom, the ultimate destination of the wondrous vehiole is a
puzzle to find, and I hail the wrong one many a time and oft. N*
sooner do 1 place my right foot on the first step, than the Conductor
gives the signal to start, and I stagger into the Omnibus amid a
number of frowning travellers who evidently regard me as a nui-
sance, instead of receiving me with weloome as a man and a brother.
My one depressing thought during the whole of the weary journey
is, will the driver condescend to stop while I alight? The silent
maniacs who travel with me seem to delight in shattering my nerves
by leaping out backwards while the driver is urging on his wild
career, and when my turn comes at last—for even a journey from
Bays water to the City must come to an end—I make an earnest appeal
to the gentleman called the Conductor—probably because he con-
ducts nothing—to kindly stop while I descend the slippery steps.
To this he growlingly assents; but often and often, especially if
we are a little late, he gives the fatal signal before I am quite safe,
and then seizes my arm in his herculean grasp to save me from the
fatal consequences of his cruel precipitancy, and I reach my office
with shattered nerves and trembling limbs. T. M.

HARD ON THE LADIES.
[Mr. Gladstoxx has written to Mr. 'Woodall regarding the Manchester
Meeting on Woman'i Suffrage, saying that Parliament has no time to discuss
the question.]
The Ladies we know have been asking for votes,
And straining unduly their eloquent throats;
Not content with Home-Rule, each dear creature agrees
She should aid, if she likes, in selecting M.P.'s:
While one day, when Man listens as still as a mouse,
She looks forward, no doubt, to addressing the House.
But alas! for her hopes, though she speaks 'mid applause,
She must wait for some time ere she tries to make laws;
Though the Manchester speeches were Bimply sublime,
Gladstone writes Mr. Woodall, and says there's no time
To'give ear to his pleading; this Session it seems
That Womanhood Suffrage remains among dreams.
O Man, how tyrannic to act in this way
When Muller scorns taxes, and lets her friends pay;
When Becker makes speeches, when Ladies show tight,
In aid of a cause that's all " sweetness and light I"
Don't talk of the Franchise, and new Bills unfold,
While Woman's left oruelly out in the cold!
ROBERT AT SHADWELL.
Well, I spose if hever a rather pore looking plaice, like Shadwell
undowtedly is, had a regler rowsing up, and a site as wood sattisfy
any reasonable peeple, it was had and seen last Wensday. Jest for a
few things, fansy the most richest Dook in the land and the most
bootiiuilest Dutchess in the land, and the most charytablest Bar-
rowness in the land, with her hansum looking husband, and the
most talleBt and Poplarest Member of the house of Commons, among
others of grate selebrity, either in a small or a large way, moludin
even one or too of my old trends of the Copperashun, all a going
down to Shadswell to see the werry fust beginnin of a Noo Fish
Market, as, when finished, will make Triumf ant Billingsgate creak
in its shoes. Fust cum the work and then the fun.
It was quite surprisin to me to see the grate strength of the hiest
branches of the Harrystockraoy. The fust thing to be dun was to
drive too piles to bild the Market on, and up steps the Dook of West-
minster for to do it. Well, as one of the Contrackter's men told me
privately as it wayed about 3 Tuns, which Bbown says is about
equal to 6 Butts of Sherry, I nat'rally thort as ewen a Dook wood
want a little asistence from a duzzen or two of the men as was a
standing about all reddy. But nothink of the sort, the Dook jest
takes hold of a sort of rudder, and pulls at it like a man, and down
the 3 tunner cums with sitch a buster as made me spill ever so mutch
of a glass of old Sherry as I was a poring out, and guv me sitch a
turn as I was obligated to drink it up and another one arter it jest
to steddy my nerves. Well, that was summut of a staggerer, but
wuss remained to follow, for the grashus Lady Buedet Coots, as
everybody loves and respeos, determmind not to he outdone by any
Dook alive, boldly stepped gracefully forward, and seizin the capstan
bar, sent sitch a 3 tunner on to the hed of the second pile as seemed
to drive him amost out of my site, and required another bumper of
sherry to set me rite again.
Then they set to bizziness, and the Baroness begun it, and she
said as any think as they wonted they coud have, then the Dook
follerd ante and said double my steak, and then Mr. Samtllion
Moblet, M.P. said as Barkis was willing and they mite draw upon
him at site, and so the little matter of money was soon settled, and
then ewerybody, espeshally the werry gentlemanly - looking
Directers, being all in werry good sperrits, they all set to work a
speech-making. And werry good speaches they was considering as
they were all made before they hadn't had not no lunch, altno it
was all wisably in site. The Baroness, bless her warm art, carried
off the Parm Iree from all on 'em, in speaking kindly and pittyingly
about the pore poor. But the speeoh of the arternoon by a werry
long ways was made by a Professing Hem Pea by the name of
Brtce. Oh, didn't he jest make us all larf; waiters and all. He sed
as Shadwell Market would be so werry shuperior in ewery reapex to
Billingsgate, that if he was a Fish swimming in the North Seas—
tho' he sertainlv didn't look a bit like one—and was a going for to
be oort, he shood say to the Fishmonger as was a going to catch him,
"Where are you a going for to take me to ?" and if.the Fishmonger
said " Billinsget," he shood say, " Oh no, not if I nose it, I ain't a
going to be sent to that scrouged uncomfertable place." But if he
said to smiling Shadwell," he should say to him " often your net,
my noble swell, and in I goes with plezzur!" Ah, that's the sort

I must say, tho sometimes inclined to be crittide wen I gets far
east of London Bridge, that everythink wus purwided nice and
cumferable. We had a reel Bishop to ask a blessing, and a reel
Wicker to say grace, and there was plenty of Shampain for all the
swells, and enuff left to satisfy all of us. And all 1 can say is, that
if the same interesting ceremony, with the same egstrordinary dis-
play of muskerler power, and the same capital speeches, all short
and sharp, and earnest and witty, and the same sort of Luncheon,
and the werry same brand of Shampain, and the werry same abund-
ance thereof, is to take place at every pile as is to be druv at Shad-
well Market, I hopes as the Market will be big enuff to require a
lot on 'em, and that I may always be there to assist in the ceremony.

WITH ALL HIS ART.
As the appearance of the recent Blue Book, professing to set forth
in full detail the progress of the negotiations ending in the proposed
purchase by the_ Government of the two famous "Blenheim"
pictures, has, owing to the freshness, vigour, astuteness and general
downright humour of all concerned in the transaction excited con-
siderable amusement and surprise in political and artistio circles,
the following supplementary telegraphio "items" of the corre-
spondence, not hitherto published, will be read with interest.
I.
The Pr-m-r, Downing Street, to Sir F. B-rt-n, National Gallery.
Tours to hand, stating you set value of £263,500 on the lot. As
this is _ about half the figure of the Soudan business, can't well
entertain it at present. Do you think a portion in a new Egyptian
fifteen per cent, stock, the rest in champagne, and £50 oash down,
would be a fair offer f
n.
Sir F. B-rt-n, National Gallery, to The Pr-m-r, Downing Street.
Very. Often done excellent business in that way. Why not
try him?
m.
The Duke of M-rlb-r-gh, Paris, to the Pr-m-r, Downing Street.
Well, you are a nice one! Wonder you don't ask me to toss you
for them next. "What's my lowest figure?" £3,000,000, and not
a penny under. Why, the frames are worth all the money. Ask
Eastlake.
■ rv.
The Pr-m-r, Dooming Street, to the Duke of M-rlb-r-gh, Paris.
Mr. Eastlake advises me: "Judging from my experience, I
should regard £3,000,000 for the frames as distinctly excessive." The
sum is, therefore, out of all consideration. You seem unaware
that it is nearly half the amount of this Soudan business. Must
decline.
v.
The Duke of M-rlb-r-gh, Paris, to the Pr-m-r, Downing Street.
All a mistake. £3,000,000 ought to have been £300,000. Send a
cheque, and the matter is settled. How will you have them? By
Parcels' Post P Only say the word.
VI.
The Pr-m-r, Downing Street, to the Duke of M-rlb-r-gh, Paris.
Cannot say the word. Never could. Still, after mature considera-
tion, am prepared to offer for the two best, including frames, £85,000.
I make a point of this. Reply promptly, as the sum is large, and
represents nearly the half cost of this Soudan business.
vn.
The Duke of M-rlb-r-gh, Paris, to the Pr-m-r, Downing Street.
Won't you make it £185,000? Can't take a penny less. Lots of
offers. Better look sharp. Come,—we '11 say £150,0001 Yes or no f

No. Must be £85,000—and mind— with the frames'!

All right. Take 'em!

A WELL-KNOWN CIRCULATrNQ LIBRARY.
PAPERS PROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
MY FIEST CLIENT.
"Hebb is something for yon, 8ir," said a sharp-looking youth,
suddenly thrusting into my hand a document.
I quietly put the paper into my pocket without comment (I had no
wish to handy words with the process-server), and reflected that
some half-forgotten tailor, or too-long-neglected hatter, was a person
of no real delicacy of feeling.
"And will you see to the matter at once P" continued the sharp-
looking youth, "as they can't wait."
"Certainly," I replied, with a dignity which I intended should
suggest that I had a perfectly fabulous account at Corrrs's. My
account at the celebrated banking Arm referred to is perfectly fabulous.
"All right, Sir. I suppose we shall see you in the morning."
The youth disappeared, and I journeyed home. As I walked along
the Thames Embankment I pondered over the alterations made in
our law by the Judicature Acts.
"When I was a younger man," I murmured to myself, "a oopy
of a writ, when considered entirely without prejudice, was rather a
handsome instrument than otherwise. The direct message from the
Sovereign, for instance, used to he very far from ungratifying,
although perhaps it would have been better had the greeting been
joined to a matter a little less embarrassing, say, than an unsatisfied
claim for the value of certain shirts. But nowadays the neat crisp
document of the olden time seems to be abandoned, for a far more
bulky paper—for the packet I have in my pocket 1"
However, I threw off my cares, and thought no more of the affair
until the next morning, when, putting on my overcoat, I discovered,
to my intense astonishment, to my overwhelming joy, that what I
had believed to be a writ was actually a Brief! I nad to sit down on
the hall-chair for five minutes to compose myself. My emotion was
perfectly painful—it was my first, my Maiden Brief! The news
spread like wildfire throngh the household, and the distant strains
of " Mule, Britannia!" were heard coming from the nursery.
There was but one thing to be done, and I did it. I hurriedly
collected all the law-books I possess (Shearwood's Abridgment of Real
Property, an odd volume of Stephen's Commentaries, and an early
edition of The Comic Blaekttone), jumped into a Hansom, and
rattled down to Pump-Handle Court. Arrived there, I handed my
brief to my Clerk (the sharp-looking youth who had given me the
paper turned out to be my Clerk), and instructed him to put it in a
prominent position in his own room, so that my client, when he
arrived, might see it, and conclude that I had bo many matters just
then in hand that I had not had as yet time to look into his case,
which was waiting its turn for consideration with numerous others.
I was ashamed to give these instructions, but reflected that it was
important, having regard to my professional prospects, that my
expected visitor should be kept as long as possible in ignorance of
the fact that he was my solitary employer.
"All right, Sir," said my Clerk, with a facial gesture which I
regret to say savoured of a wink. "He will be here by eleven."
I now entered my own room. It was rather in disorder. I share
my chambers with an intimate friend, and as I am very often away,
he sometimes uses my sanctum (entirely with my consent) as a recep-
tacle for empty packing-cases, old cigar-boxes, superfluous window-
curtains, and worn-out boots. With the assistance of my Clerk,
who followed me in, I soon set things to-rights, putting on the
Month-indicator from October to March, filling the inkstand with

oopying fluid, and removing somebody's pot-hat from the brows of my bust of
the late Lord Chancellor Beouqhah.
"There, Sir, I think that will do now," said my Clerk, with a look of
satisfaction, and he left me seated at my desk turning over some dusty brief
paper which I had found knocking about in one of its drawers.
My room is a semi-subterranean apartment in a circular tower. I have two
small casements looking out upon some gardens, but as I occupy the basement,
I can only see the ankles of the passers-by, and am myself free from observation
save when some more than usually unruly urchin brings his head level with
mine, and makes faces at me through the window.
I repeat 1 was turning over the dusty brief-paper, and toying with Mr.
Shearwood's very excellent "Abridgment," when the door was thrown open
and my Clerk announced " Someone to see you, Sir."
_ "You will pardon me," I said, without looking up, consulting in the mean-
time the handbook, before me with knitted brows, "but I am engaged for a few
moments. I will attend to you directly."
"Ob, certainly, Sir," replied the new-comer, in the most deferential tone
possible, and he took a seat.
I jotted down the incidents of Borough English, frowned as if engaged in
deep thought, and then smilingly turned to my visitor, and asked him now I
could be of service to him.
"I want you to look into this case, Sir," he began, with a timidity that was
as unexpected as it was gratifying—his nervousness gave me confidence.
'By all means/' I responded heartily, dipping a pen into the ink, and putting
a fresh sheet of brief-paper over the page I had already used for the incidents of
Borough English and a freehand sketch of a British Grenadier, "I shall be glad
to hear all about it."
"I must apologise for intruding upon you, knowing how busy you are, but I
thought you would be interested in what I have to plaoe before you."
'Pray do not apologise," I hastened to say; and then added, with a little
laugh, "I certainly have taken you out of your turn, but then this is our first
transaction. I hope it will not be the last"
"1 hope so, too," replied my client, fervently. "If you will allow me,
I will often plaoe things like this before you. I should have come to you
earlier, only so many Gentlemen object to seeing me."
"Dear me ! "• I replied, a little surprised. "I suppose
some men don't care to jeopardise their professional
reputation by failure. And now, with your permission,
I will.look into your case."
"It is here. Sir," he answered, opening a rather large
portfolio. "You will notice that these are very beautiful
engravings."
Certainly," I returned, making a note on the paper
before me, as you say, most beautiful. No doubt of
very considerable value."
"I am glad you like them, Sir. They are forced to
be got rid of at an enormous sacrifice."
Indeed!" I ejaculated, continuing my notes.
"Yes, Sir. They are being sold at something less
than cost-price."
"Really!" And again I jotted down the particulars.
Then I said, to show that 1 comprehended the affair at a
glanoe, "I suppose there has been a dispute about the
copyright?"
"No. Sir, that's all right."
"Ah, to be sure—then there has been a breach of
contract?" But finding that this also was not the case,
I said, with hearty bonhomie, "Well, my dear Sir, as 1
have made two baa guesses, perhaps you had better tell
me what I can do for you."
My client coughed deferentially, and then produced a
paper.
"I beg your pardon, Sir, but would you mind signing
this?"
I read the document—it ran as follows:—
"To Messes. Scamp and Vamp.—I hereby agree to
purchase one copy of your ' Pillars of the Law, from the
Earliest Ages,' profusely Illustrated, in One hundred and
fifty-seven Monthly Parts, at seven shillings and sixpence
a part. Ifurther agree to pay for this Work annually,
at the rate of twelve Parts in advance"
There was a solemn and awful pause. Then I drew
myself up to my full height, and in a voice of thunder
ordered him out! I know not how he disappeared—in a
moment he had vanished, portfolio and all 1
Bather fatigued after my late exertions, I called to my
Clerk, and with weary haughtiness desired him to bring
me my Brief, as I wished " to glanoe through the papers.
"Your Brief, Sir?" he returned. ,?Oh, I should
have told you, Sir, that, while you were talking to the
man with the engravings, they called to see you. They
said they were in a hurry, and, as you were engaged,
they would take it to some one else."
'Take it to some one else!" My Maiden Brief!
At this point I must pause—for the moment, I can
write no more! A. Briefless, Junior.
A PLEA FOR PORT.
[Two quite disinterested Vine-merchants have pointed out
in the Standard that gout is unknown in Portugal, where
the inhabitants drink a lighter kind of port than that usually
imbibed in this country.]
Now, merry bon-vivants, come draw up your chairs,
From John o' Groat's house down to Truro,
For Sage has asserted and Pan ii km ax swears
That gout's never known on the Douro.
At home or abroad, in New York or Japan,
In Constantinople or Agra,
Go tipple port wine, boys, as hard as you can,
And ne'er be afraid of Podagra.
But Saoe and his partner will say, if you ask,
The port that should moisten your throttle,
Must be the light wine that comes out of the cask,
Not that you've matured in the bottle.
It is not the ancient and fearsome " black-strap,"
A potion in sooth diabolic,
For this is a lighter and pleasanter tap,
And hardly at all alcoholic.
'Tis warranted never to colour your nose,
Dyspepsia's terrible warning;
It wont Dring the gout to your fingers and toes,
Or give you a "head" in the morning.
In short it's a truly delectable wine,
The sort from the cellar you'd fish up,
To offer your guest if a Duke came to dine,
And fit for the gills of a Bishop!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"ET TU BRUTE!"
B&utus is a play by the late Lord Litton in five Acts and a head-
ache. Of the characters in it let ns first take Lucretia, played by Miss
Eastlabte. A mild dose of burlesque treatment has evidently done
this lady a considerable amount of good. It has almost cured her of
those 8t.-Vitus-like nervous clutchings and palsied movement of the
head which, at one time, threatened to become chronic On the first
night she knew her lines perfectly, but stuck once,—with a trick-
dagger. There is nothing grand in it, but a nice quiet little bit of
classical domestic suicide.
There is an Egyptian Slave who talks a good deal about the rebels,
and is evidently the Mahdi of that
period. He has "no connection"
with the plot, "except on business,"
when he is useful for a picturesque
tableau or two in conjunction with
Brutus. There is also a Sybil who
might be the weaker half of the
Holy Clement in Claudian.
The wicked Tarquin is perpetu-
ally throwing up nis eyes to the
"sky-borders," and expressing a
strong interest in the movements of
Venus. From this it might be
gathered that he is on the Transit
of Venus Commission. This, how-
ever, is not so. He is accompanied
by some gay Roman dogs—not " the
Household Dogs" — who sprawl
about in a room of the Pompeian House at the Crystal Palace, make
melancholy attempts at conviviality, and Cry " To horse! To horse!"
when, considering their costume, "To clothes-horse! To clothes-
horse!" would have been far more appropriate. They were a hardy
race, those ancient sons of the Latin Grammar and Classical
Dictionaries.
The character of Lucius Junius Brutus, the Roman, has nothing
to do with the Romany Rye, though, by the way, he it a sort of

Brutus
Caulitlow
classical Silver King, as,
to be revenged on his
enemies, the Silver King,
—we forget his name,—
pretended to be a Silly
Billy—and so does Brutus.
The Silver King thus
gains his object—so does
Brutus. There is no
difference, apparently,
between Brutus foolish
and Brutus wise; at least
Mr. Barrett made none.
There is a touch of a
Claudianesque situation
in it, too, when the
Mahdi tries to stab him,
and can't, and when
Tarquin repeats the at-
tempt, and fails in the
st upidest manner possible.
Mr. Barrett is, through-
out, oppressed by the
consciousness of his in-
tense olassicality, and
never has his eye off the
imaginary Photographer,
or allows the future pic-
torial mural advertisement to be lost to the view of his mind's eye.
Of the play itself, the subjeot is—" not to put too fine a point upon
it"—revolting. But, having selected it, the noble Author has
treated it as delicately as possible. The dialogue may be very good,
but we could catch so little of it that we must defer any opinion
until an opportunity has been afforded to us of reading it. When
we have done this, we shall be better able to say whether the Actors
have faithfully carried out the Author's ideas; and the receipts
will show whether the Author's ideas were worth the trouble.
Such situations as there are, are of the old familiar dramatic
pattern, and pretty safe.
Between the Acts were handed round, by way of refreshment,
printed lists of the distinguished audience then present, and a paper
of elegant extracts from the play for the benefit of those who couldn't
hear what was said on the stage. The distinguished people who were
present, but whose names Were not in the above-mentioned list,
thought the proceeding most snobbish. Perhaps they were right.
The last Scene will be more effective as a "set when the two
pillars of state on each side of the tinselly throne look less shaky.

Smashing the Mahdi.
On the first night we found the play wearisome. But it might have
been worse if the Comio Roman, who laughed loudly at nis own
jokes, had not suddenly disappeared after the Seoond Act. We fancy
we saw him wandering about, living on his past reputation as an
amusing rattle, but never—thank heaven and Lord Ltttow !—getting

Tarquin. "My unlimited Loo-cretia!"
Lucretia. "Sir! Who are you a Tarquin to?"
an opportunity of airing any of his ill-timed Antiquos Josephot.
There was no original dramatic situation, there were no striking
characters.—except the people who used their daggers,—no ghosts,
no marvellous changes of soene, no curse worth mentioning, and no
earthquake. The summary of the play, therefore, as a spectacle,
would be " No Effects."

EAR! EAR!
It is pleasing to note that those who will be held responsible for
the success or the reverse of the forthcoming "Inventions Exhibi-
tion" at South Kensington, are evidently already thoroughly on
their mettle. Indeed, several features of the undertaking—notably
in the department devoted to Music—appear to have been conceived
with a dash and daring as surprising as they are original. To begin
with, there is to be a Grand Hall of refuge, to which any visitor who
has been suddenly struck by the outward appearance of an exhibited
Instrument—an Ophicleide, for instance—will be able to hurry off
together with the Inventor and a friend to blow it, and test its
capabilities to the fullest extent, without being stopped by the
Policej and, but for the presence of rival purchasers, in comparative
seclusion.
"Some provision of the kind," says the report, "was necessary,
since the Council have drawn up a regulation intended to save the
Public from the din and discord of a continuous attack from the
whole line of Pianos, Trumpets, Drums, Concertinas, Cymbals,
Gongs, Bassi, and harmonised Fog Signals, with which the Central
Gallery will be almost inconveniently crowded."
But that there may be no mistake at least about the physical effeots
of the " power of sound," the Council have, with much quaint humour,
determined "on one day in each week to relax this rule," con-
ceiving, as they put it, "that on that day persons of sensitive
organisations will- hardly approach the Central Gallery, unless,"—
and here is the quiet and subtle fun of the regulation,— ' they do so
quite by inadvertence."
It is not astonishing, after this, to hear that not only will this
same Central Gallery contain, in addition, "six great pipe-organs,"
but that the Council, by way of making sure that their petite ruse
de bruit shall not fail, intend also to scatter " at least half-a-dozen
other large and heavily-piped organs" freely about the building in
its most unsuspected quarters. The details of the Deaf and probably
Dumb Asylum that must inevitably be called into requisition by this
portion of the programme of the Council, are not yet publicly
announced, but that, there will be erected somewhere in the grounds
a handsome and well-endowed Institution of the kind provided with
an efficient staff of distinguished aurists, goes without saying. But
we shall hope later literally to "hear something more of this
practical, spirited, and thoroughly jocose enterprise.
"Bless you,—tou Know what I Mean."—The case of Lusby's
Music Hall v. Mr. Charrington,—not a Mr. Cheeringtone, to judge
by the way he used to speak of the unfortunate Lusby's,—was heard
before Mr. Justice Ciurrr. The Defendant had circulated a leaflet
headed, "This way to the Pit of "—well, a word never mentioned
in polite society, but synonymous with Tartarus. Would he have
been within his right if, instead of relying on his imagination, he
had simply headed his pamphlet, "This way to the pit —as a sort
of advertisement for Lusby's Music Hall? This question was not
put to the learned Judge, who gave a sort of six-of-one-and-half-a-
dozen-of-t'other decision, which, however, will have the effect of
checking the enthusiasm of Mr. Charrington.
Scott v. Spicer.—Something peculiarly spioey being expected,
the Court was crowded with fashionable persons, and after all—there
was no trial. How provoking—for that audienoe! Worse than
Sims Reeves disappointing a hall full of admirers at the last
moment. Yet it was appropriate that a case which arose out of
courting should be settled " out of Court."

Yes you, notwithstanding your Jovian looks,
And your bouncing black-board and your piles of White Books.
Lord bless you, old boy, we've been lectured before,
And the subacid sneer, and the pedagogue roar,
Our tympanum tickle but do not disturb.
Napoleon would bridle, and Nicholas curb,
The slow, sometimes stumbling, good-natured old brute,
Each thought might be driven to crouch at his foot.
But Leo, though not always rampant, won't grovel,—
Not even to you. The attempt is not novel.
Poor Louis, puffed into an Oracle, tricked
Half the world into awe, till the bubble youpricked;
And though Punch won't suggest you 're a Windbag in tura,
Yet perhaps even you an apt lesson might learn
From past flatulent failures. Orbilian Colossus
You'd chide us, and spank us, and goad us, and toss us,
But when Polyphemus world-wigging, would try.
He may—pardon the argot—get one in the eye.
And Punch, Herr Professor, whose point seldom misses,
Is ready, if needful, to play the Ulysses.
Verb, sap.,—you are wise, though Minerva's own owl,
That exceedingly knowing and gogglesome fowl,
Couldn't look half so sage as you fancy you are.
But your pompous de-haut-en-bas lecturings jar
Ou the proud, and the wise move to tolerant smiles,
When addressed, "Everywhere and the neighbouring Isles."
Pooh I pooh! Let not Oscab Wilde's style be your study,
For—as he would say—you are not " Evrabuddy."
And then, look at home! There is many a mull, for
The like of which here you'd condemn us to—sulphur.
But Wisdom won't holloa in old Giant Grim's tone,
Nor is the sole cure for earth's botherments brimstone!
Best put down your ferule and drop your black looks,
Your black-board won't scare us, nor yet your White Books.
O'er a bock and tobacco, as equal with.equal,
Let's take friendly counsel. I '11 warrant the sequel
Of peace and firm friendship will yield a more sure hope
Than any amount of tart. Lectures to Europe!
MEM. FOR MUD-SALAD MARKET.
In Andrews v. Mansfield—a case heard last week—Plaintiff
brought an aotion against Defendant for a nuisance of muck and
rubbish in a field, which, it seems, to put it politely, scented him away
from his house and home. Corroborative evidence on the Nose side was
brought. For the defence, on the No-nose side, Experts were called.
Dr. Tidy's evidence against the probability of such a smell having
existed was as strong as the Noses had pronounced the odour itself to
have been. If there were any smell at all, the Noses were, said the
Doctor (and how neatly Dr. Tidy might have put it!) on the wrong
scent. The Jury, however, found for the Noses, with £110 damages,
and Defendant was restrained from continuing the nuisance.
In this beautiful spring Cabbagian, Turnip-topian, and Sprouting
early vegetable season, need the moral of this, in a kindly and con-
siderate way, be pointed out to the Nosey neighbourhood, and to the
Noble, but Noseless Management of Mud-Salad Market f By the way,
considering the prominent and characteristic feature of the ancient
tribes to which so many of the fruit and flower dealers in and about
Mud-salad Market belong, there ought to be no difficulty in obtaining
the evidence of the very best Noses in the world on this matter, when
required.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, March 2.—House met to-
day, as if nothing particular had happened on Saturday morning.
Strange to say, Government, with a nominal majority of 14, and
an aotaal majority of 58, on Vote of Censure, not going to resign!
Gladstone's seat on Treasury Bench vacant. Habtihoton presently
rises to explain that the Premier is indisposed; whereat Warton
oheers, and is promptly rolled over, amid howls of disgust from
Liberals.
"Why should they howl at Warton?" Labbt asks. "I think
his cheer was creditable to him. He has the courage, or the insensi-
bility, to give open expression to feelings you hear privately uttered
whenever two or three Tories meet together. Warton should be
encouraged, instead of being put down."
Henry the Tyler more than ever coming to the front on Foreign
Affairs. Coolness growing between him and Ashmead Babtlett.
"Whydoesn't he mind his Railways," says A. B., snappishly.
"Canada is quite sufficient of a foreign country for him. Here I 've
been looking after this Government for four years in Afghanistan,
in South Africa, in Egypt, and lately in New Guinea; and now
Tyler's going to set up in opposition."
Tyler not to be denied; nas been telegraphing to Suakim to
inquire about the fate of Eassala. "Would Italian interference be
of any use?" he added, as if, Dilke says, he held Italy in the palm
of his hand, and could dispose of her military and naval forces.
House not yet quite used to Tyler in this new charaoter; clings with
affectionate regard to older claims of Ashmead Bartlett. But Tyler
evidently means business, and the Universe has a fresh protector.
After storm of questions, Lubbock opened up Proportional Repre-
sentation, with Courtney to follow. Whereupon pressing business
called Members elsewhere. Towards midnight, Motion for Adjourn-
ment. Broadhubst angrily declared that he was "not going to be
induced to stay here till all the respectable publichouses in London
were closed." But bar's open in the Lobby till the House rises, and
Bboadhurst needn't have been so petulant.
Business done.—Boyal Messages on Reserves and Militia agreed to.
Tuesday.—Warton rises to explain. It seems that his cheer
yesterday has been "misunderstood." From the "malioious com-
ments of a partizan Press," he gathers that it was accepted as sign of
satisfaction at illness of Premier. Warton says it was not so, but
discreetly refrains from explaining what it did mean.
House crowded in anticipation of engagement between Parnellites
and Speaker. Rowland Winn got his forty men in hand to back

"The Chair " making its Authority respected.
up Parnellites, if necessary, in obtaining leave to move Adjournment.
But Speaker spoiled little game. Ruled it out of order, and made
way for business. This turned out to be, once more, Proportional
Representation, introduced by Professor Courtney, and ably seconded
by Professor Lubbock. Entertainment rather a failure. Coubtney's
most lucid explanation disturbed by row at door. Several people
insisting upon having their money back. Strangers in Gallery went
out to think the matter over in retirement. So did majority of
Members. Gladstone, who came back to-night looking wan and
weary, sat it out with ohin resting on stick. On the whole, a
Sleasant, instructive evening. Hear we 're to have series of them.
Text is arranged for with the Gentleman who has come over from
the other side with particulars of new American Whist. Means to
explain this on Motion to go into Committee of Supply. Habcoubt
back to-night, after brief visit to the country. "Then you've not
resigned P I said, coming up behind him, and playfully giving a
sudden bark. Habcoubt jumped to other side of the Corridor.
"Don't do that, Toby," he said, querulously. "It's humorous,
but out of place. If you had my berth for a day, you'd know what
it is to have your nerves unstrung. Never open my letters in the
morning without finding warning, 'Prepare for deth.' Have quite
a collection of sketches of coffins, mysterious parcels delivered at my
house containing all kinds of things, from the bodies of unburied
babes to oases containing infernal machines, which turn out to be
only portions of broken works of watches. I'm sick to death of sight
of policemen, whether in uniform or plain clothes. The shadow of a
policeman follows me everywhere, and yet I can't dispense with the
reality. Indeed I want more. I start at my own shadow, and
suspect the designs of the street-boy who offers me matches two boxes
a penny. I daresay, if I bought them, they'd explode in my Docket.
Wish I was Robinson Crusoe. But tnen 1'd want Scotland X ard to
shadow Friday. Went down to the Forest on Saturday, but
couldn't stand threatening look of the tree-branches. Come back to
town, and you frighten life out of me with your inconsiderate joking.
I'm not tne man I was, Toby. But as for resigning, they won't
let me." A tear stole down his manly cheek. It recalled him to a
sense of his official position. He had it immediately arrested, and
went his way, furtively looking round to see if he was followed.
Bbadlauoh baok to-night after long absence. Labby went and
sat near him under Gallery. Heads so close together seemed to be
embracing.
"Peace and Truth have kissed each other," said Jimmy Lowtheb,
regarding with dim eyes the affecting Bcene.
Business done.—Debate on Seats Bill.
Thursday.—Honours of Sitting divided between Sir F. Mllneb
and that noted connoisseur and patron of Fine Arts, Le Chevalier
Joseph Gillis Biogar. Sir Frederick does not often speak.
"Curious similitude to a lady namesake in a certain trial," says
Solicitor-General, fresh from Probate Court. "Politically shy.
Rarely goes beyond Yes' or 1 No' in debate."
One subject unseals Sir Frederick's lips. Doesn't exactly make
him voluble, but he becomes articulate. That is Chamberlain, and
the affidavits of the lamented Larry Mack.
"Give me," says Sir Frederick in moment of confidence, "a
couple of days to think it over, a quiet room, a good quill, and plenty
of paper, and I '11 draw you up, in form of question, a stunner for
Chamberlain. Don't hurry me. That's all I ask."
More than a fortnight since Milner last spoke on this subject.
By dint of taking regular exercise, going to bed early, getting up
late, powerfully concentrating his mind on the subject, has worked
himself up to pitch of producing another " stunner." Chamberlain
disposes of it with affeoted lightness. But Sir Frederick knows the
dart has gone home. Elated with success, he half rises to retort on
Chamberlain. But it doesn't do to flog a willing horse. Almost
had something to say, but not quite, so sat down again: and, whilst
questions proceeded through another hour, drew up fresh " stunner."
Didn't go off very welL Speaker rather sat on it. But Sir Frede-
rick not disheartened.
"I'll take a rest now," he says. "Won't think anymore till
Monday. Daresay in a fortnight or so shall have worked out another
question."
As for Joseph Gillis, what moved him was proposal to vote
£70,000 for one of the Blenheim pictures. Joseph earnestly desires
to encourage Art, but demurs to the price.
"I'm fond of picters meself," he whispered to Wolff, sitting on
bench below him. "There's a friend of mine in Belfast, in the
porkbuteher-line, who's got in his shop a lovely thing—a man driv-
ing a pig- twisting its tail; tail comes off; pig runs on; so natral, ye
think ye hear him squeal. Never pass the shop without dropping in
to look at this. And what d'ye think he paid for it P"
"A considerable sum, I should think, says Sir Henry, deeply
interested.
"Eighteen-and-six and a pound of sassages," says Joey B.,
triumphantly.
Joseph listened critically to the debate, smiling scornfully at
Willis, d. C, when he announced, with convincing wave of the
hand, that he had " visited the Louvre." J. B. remembers, with a
smile of varied emotion, that he had not only been all over the
Louvre, but had also visited the Bon MarchG. In fact it was at the
latter establishment he bought the hose that figured so prominently
in a certain breach of promise case.

Joseph's interposition in debate hailed with loud cheers. He was
brief, but to the point. "Let the vote be postponed," he suggested;
"bring the pioter down and hang it in the tea-room, so that we may
have an opportunity of seeing the article."
"Not at all a bad idea," says Gibson, "we should then have two
priceless pictures in the tea-room. Raphael's masterpiece hung on
the wall, and before it Joseph Gillis with a thumb in either arm-
hole of his waistcoat, critically regarding the Madonna, and
appraising ' the article.'"

who was successfully getting through narrow Corridor.
"Pussy Granville is purring at Bulldog Bismarck," said the
genial Member for Rochdale.

The brief announcement made last week to the effect that the
popular Lessee of the Lyceum had telegraphed from New York to
the distinguished Author of Becket} in the nope of securing to him-
self the acting right of that historic drama, having created no little
stir in literary and artistic circles, the subjoined full and complete
text of the correspondence, conducted, necessarily, at some slight
disadvantage by cable, will probably be read with interest:—

"Would like much to put up at once our old friend Becket. Have

Terms no object. Anything you like, or can suggest, for your own

High-Art upholstery effort. Few slight changes in text requisite,
but of no great importance. Cable reply by return. My heart goes
out to you over the idea.
II.
Lord T-nnys-n, Freshwater, to H-nry Irv-ng, New York.
Thank you for your heart. With regard to your proposal, I am
disposed to entertain it. I take much to the suggestion of the por-
trait, but am advised that three colours will not insure anything
very striking. Wish to come out well on the hoardings. This is
essential. Great object of production at all is " dramatic" reputa-
tion. By the way, what are "few slight changes in text of no
great importance" to which you refer? I would like to be informed
on this point.

H-nry". Irv-ng, N(W York, to Lord T-nnys-n, Freshwater.
"Few slight changes " are mere trifles. Here they are. Cut down
half of Acts I., II., IV. and V., about seventy-five pages in all, and
let action of Act III. take place on board ship in a hurricane. Take
out French King, say three Bishops, De Broc, Lord Leicester,
Philip de Eleemosyna, two Knights Templars, John of Oxford, and
somehow manage to double Becket and Henry. Must play them
both as they stand. If objeot to this, give all Henry's good bits to
Becket. Will strengthen it immensely. This is chief point. Comio
Beggars of course come out. Also Walter Map. His heavy tragedy
won t go down. Better make him a dumb acrobat. Why not black?
One more suggestion. Good rollicking drinking song for four
Knights, and bring them in on horseback. Eh?
IV.
L-rd T-nnys-n, Freshwater, to H-nry Irv-ng, New York.
Lyrios for Knights entering on horseback—yes, but absolutely
decline to out out seventy-five pages, or seventy-five lines, or even
seventy-five words, anywhere. Put it all into Becket's part if you
like, but let the public have it in some shape or other. "Comio
beggars" must stand—the whole lot of them. Are, I am told, by
intimate and impartial friends who are excellent judges, "fresh,
original, and quite killing," and will bring the house down nightly.
You mistake Walter Map. He is meant to be a Shakspearian clown
—but a great deal better read. As to doubling Henry and Becket,
it is impossible on account of the chess. How could you manage it t
v.
H-nry Irv-ng, New York, to Lord T-nnys-n, Freshwater.
Have managed it. They will play football in turns with a dummy.
Never on the Stage together. Please re-write up to this. Leave
Walter Map, Comio Beggars, Bishops, and rest to me. Will get
them on if I can. Anyhow, it will be all right. Never fear.
You won't know your own piece.
VI.
Lord T-nnys-n, Freshwater, to H-nry Irv-ng, New York.
Your last to hand. It has much confused and disheartened 'me.
What do you mean by " not knowing my own piece "? As to playing
football with a dummy, please write to Freeman, and get authorities
for this in the twelfth century. I do not take to or understand this
"toady truckling to a tricky stage." If the costumes and posters are
ordered, I can only say, "Produce the garbled version if you will,
but without my name.
VII.
H-nry Irv-ng, New York, to L-rd T-nnys-n, Freshwater.
Impossible. Not the slightest good. Your name is the only thing
I want!
VIII.
Lord T-nnys-n, Freshwater, to H-nry Irv-ng, New York.
Negotiations had better close. Besides I have this morning received
a letter posted in Oxford Street. You understand. I am quite decided
now. Every line must stand.
IX.
H-nry Irv-ng, New York, to Lord T-nnyson, Freshwater.
Every line shall stand. Only my fun. May write in seventy-
five pages more, if you like. Will that please you? Cable back at
once. Settled?

A TRANSMITTED CHARACTERISTIC.
Op the evolution prooess I'm a singular example,
Without exaggeration I may say, a splendid sample;
For present to my memory are all the various stages
Through which my microcosm passed in prehistoric ages.
From monad down to monkey, all the creatures 1 have been
Were tormented by an appetite unusually keen:
What I liked, or what disliked, I don't remember in the least';
Bat I know that I was always an extremely greedy beast!

When a shapeless blob of jelly—my digestion, though, was strong—
1 persistently assimilated something all day long.
.Eons later (I was then an oyster lying on my bed)
From rosy mom to dewy eve inoessantly I fed.
My career as a crustacean was cut short, I grieve to state,
By a surfeit of a dear departed eel, just thrice my weight:—
And that even as a crab I could not moderately feast,
Is a proof that I was always an extremely greedy beast.
I recollect how, when a fish, I spent my time quite gaily
In swallowing some dozens of my fellow-fishes daily.
This practice in my character may seem a cruel feature,
But don't forget that I was then a mere cold-blooded creature.
And when—now was it ten, or was it forty oycles later V—
In course of due promotion I became an alligator,
My relatives I never fed on, even when deceased,
Although they all considered me a very greedy beast.
Through subsequent developments of zoologic station
I managed, as a glutton, to maintain my reputation.
'Twas mine through ev'ry class of ornithology to wander,
From the unobtrusive dodo to the enterprising condor.
I fear that, when a crow, I was regarded as a sinner,
For I used to steal my neighbours eggs and eat them up for dinner;
With every stage of progress my voracity increased.
And—though a bird—I still, alas! remained a greedy beast.
As time went on I steadily advanced towards perfection,
Obedient to the standing laws of Natural Seleotion.
To survive, and be the fittest, instinct taught me was my duty;
So I did my best by feeding to keep up my strength and beauty.
As badger, rat, or tiger—as rhinoceros or sheep—
I seldom left off eating, day or night, unless to sleep.
Carnivorous or otherwise, my hunger never ceased;
I often changed my form, but still remained a greedy beast.
'Twas in a virgin-forest of the tropical Gaboon
I led a truly comfortable life as a baboon.
I dwelt among the tree-tops, where the atmosphere was pure,
And what a lot of bread-fruit I devoured, to be sure!
There, there I learnt a solemn truth—deny it he who can!—
'Tis this: the monkey, not the child, is father to the man.
He is, indeed, what man would be, from social bonds released,
Impulsive, vengeful, whimsical—a savage, greedy beast.
And now 'mong creatures animate I hold the foremost station,
A biped without feathers, alias Lord of the Creation:
Articulate my speech is—I can logioally reason—
But where's the tail I dangled with, the branches of the trees on?
My eyesight's weak, my swimming s poor; I've lost the knack of
flying;
My daily life's embittered by the constant fear of dying:
My appetite alone is undiminished, nay increased,
And the Heir to all the Ages still remains—a greedy beast!
THE MIDDLEMAN ONCE MOEE.
Jy medio tutissimus ibis evidently does not mean there is safety in
the Middleman—not, at least, in the opinion of the British Trade
Journal. In its March number that Journal tells those who do not
already know it,—and who in many cases seem strangely unwilling
to learn it,—" More about the Middleman." And the more we know
of him the less we like him. The B. T. J., which ought to know
one would think, calls him "an unnecessary go-between.]' And
that too often, though of course not always, he assuredly is. But
not that alone. A fifth wheel of a coach may be " unnecessary,"
but is not inevitably an expensive and pace-hindering nuisance. If
you can conceive a fifth wheel" that costs as much as all the other
four put together, does hardly any of the work, and tends ultimately
to upset the coach, you may get a fair parallel to what the Middle-
man often is in trade matters in this trading community of ours.
The B. T. J. says that in the Fish Trade he is still rampant, whilst
in the Meat Trade his species is paramount:—
"Between the starring farmer at one end of the line, and the starving
workman at the other, there is a row of jovial and rotund Middlemen, who,
as cattle-dealers, drovers, salesmen, slaughterers, meat-carriers, and butchers,
form a happy family unaffected by the straits of tho producer, and banded
together at the expense of the purchasing Public."
Pleasant, eh! my]poor purblind "purchasing Public?" Pretty
well for a myth? No! Some wag has said that the prevailing
tendenoy of the day is to resolve everything into a Sun-myth.
Perhaps. But the most ardent and ingenious comparative mytho-
logist will hardly be able to deal so with the Middleman.
In the Export Trade he appears to be even more active:—
"But few branches of manufacture do not admit of direct contact with the
wholesale importer abroad. At present we have, very frequently, first the
manufacturer, then the wholesale house abroad, then the retailer or shop-
keeper, and then the consumer out of whose pockets this file of distributors,
with the maker at its head, must be supported. Is it a matter for surprise
that foreign competitors with a more direct and intelligent system of
distribution can undersell us?"
These ingenious divisions and subdivisions, as the B. T. J. points
out, and as Mr. Punch has previously intimated, furnish abundant
chances for speculation and sharp practices, and for trading without
sufficient capital or knowledge of business, to the detriment of the
article, and the ruin of our reputation for commercial honesty. How,
Mr. Punch hopes to explain in fuller detail on future occasion. The
Commission Agents, who know—nay, wish, and take care to know
nothing about the "goods" they deal—or rather juggle with—whose
only aim is, with the least possible outlay for rent, and other trade
expenses, to pick the largest possible profits out of "transactions"
in which bad " goods " are sold at high prices to duped purchasers,
this is a species of Middleman—widely distributed, alas f—whom it
were base flattery to call a pestilent mischief, destructive as his
cunning system is of fair profits to producers, fair prices to pur-
chasers, and fair fame to the nation in the markets of the world.
"Fair Trade" quotha? This is the sort of negation, of " Fairness"
which, as Mr. Punch has before declared, demands dealing sum-
marily with. And if the Dun ravens, and Lowthebs, and Chap-
ltns directed their efforts against such Unfair Trade as the Middle-
man conducts, and fattens on, instead of flying in the face of fact,
and fighting against economio law, Mr. Punch would proclaim him-
self a Fair Trader to-morrow.
"Eight about Pee-pace!"—Yes, we must write about Preface.
It is getting serious; for, speaking of the Inventions Exhibition, the
Daily News informs us that "the Catalogue will contain twenty-
three prefaoes." We have generally found one preface too much
for us, but fancy twenty-three! Let us hope the number has been
altogether exaggerated, and that the Committee will pause before
carrying out their prefacetious projeot.

PUBLIC GRIEVANCES.
{By Our Own Inspector.)
No. VI—Cabs.
Sir,—The immense experience you must be rapidly gaining in
regard to our many grievances should enable you to answer any
question "there anent," as the Scotch say, right off the reel. So
please inform the wide-awake, go-ahead men of London why our
London Gondolas, as Dizzr christened onr Hansoms, if he could
christen anything, are not made more comfortable than they are. As
it is simply impossible to conceive any condition of weather so
atrocious as to tempt anyone of us to even think of entering a stuffy,
crawling, noisy, dirty Growler, Hansoms are our sole resource, and
anything more awfully atrocious than the complicated machinery
that it seems it is necessary to put in motion to keep out the effects
of a drenching downpour of rain, I, for one, decline to believe in.
Let me state my experience of Wednesday, as a case in point. I
had been asked to dine with the family of my affianced bride, in
order to be introduced to her maternal Aunt, from whom, in case of
a certain highly probable contingency, certain beneficial results
would possibly ensue to the wife of my bosom. I need scarcely say
that I arrayed myself with special care in my very choicest apparel,
and, with Youth at the prow and Cabby at the helm, as Gray says,
I set off on my pleasant trip. It came on to rain, but not ferociously,
and, Cabby taking the wrong turning, I shouted to him convulsively,
and leant out to correct his blunder, when, mistaking my meaning,
he let down the whole complicated machinery for excluding the
gentle rain, full upon my upturned face. I almost screamed with
agony, and quite swore with rage, and on driving back headlong to
my bachelor home, I rushed to the looking-glass, "and there my
eyes behold, all that my heart believed not, yet foretold." I may
describe myself, shortly, as being the wild possessor of two black
eyes and an ensanguined nose, and the sad results of my misfortune
were freely distributed over my hitherto spotless shirt-front. I draw
a veil over the Bad results, with the full conviction, that the most
vivid imagination will fail to exaggerate their importance to me, and
all arising from the dense stupidity of using a complicated machine
to accomplish a simple object, like the attempt to open oysters by
electrioity. E. D,
Sir,—My life is made a misery to me by my'one grand virtue,
combined with an atrocious grievance. My one grand virtue is in-
domitable resolve never to be imposed upon. My atrocious grievance
is "Growlers." My experience of last night is but a repetition of
many similar exasperating occurrences. I was invited to a grand
West-End receptioD. The distance from house to house is exactly
one mile and three-quarters. I hired a damp, rattling, stuffy,
rling Growler. At my journey's end I tendered the slovenly-
looking driver a shilling, that being his strictly legal fare. It .,
pouring in torrents; so I rushed up the steps, and knocked loudly.
Would you believe it, Sir, the awful-looking, saturated, and, I verily
believe, semi-intoxicated driver, actually followed me into the grand
house, loudly demanding an additional sixpence, to the intense
amusement of the grinning flunkeys, and the undisguised astonish-
ment and disgust of the arriving guests. True to my indomitable
resolve, I firmly refused his exorbitant demand, when he actually
tried to follow me up the noble staircase, and, when stopped by the
attendants, loudly demanded my card, which I gave him, to quiet
him, when, to my horror, he shouted out my name at the very top of
his husky voice, and denounced me as the very shabbiest man he
ever drove, just as the Master of the House, astonished at the un-
usual noise, came down the stairs to inquire into its cause. Who can
say that I was not right in my heroic resolve, and that I did not
display an amount of moral courage worthy of an ancient Stoic?
Then, why was I doomed to a martyrdom, unconscionably terrible to
bear, by a lioensed ruffian, to whom I had done no wrong? Abolish
this grievance, Sir, and receive the thanks of mankind.

THE GAINSBOROUGH SHOW AT THE GROSVENOR. OUR OWN PRIVATE VIEW.
ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.
Pebblebeach.—The news of the resignation of the Hon. Stonky
de Bkok E has caused the greatest excitement in this town, where the
Hon. Member has not been seen for over six months. On the receipt
of his letter, announcing his intention of retiring from Parliamentary
life, and devoting himself to travelling in America, the lawyers'
offices were at once besieged by their late Member's tradesmen, and
next Thursday is expected to be the heaviest day in the County
Court that has been known for a long time.
Dullslet.—Lord Sleefton, the Tory Member, in answer to his
constituents, has declared that although he does not approve of the
Sabbath closing of public-houses, yet he is strongly in favour of
marching with the times, and thinks that Museums ought to be
thrown open on Sunday. As Dullsley contains sixty-three public-
nouses, and no Museum, his Lordship's answer has aroused the
greatest excitement and interest.
Kottow.v.—A leading inhabitant of this town having written to
the senior Member as to when he fancies the war in the East will be
at an end, has received a reply in which the Hon. Gentleman states
that he doesn't know. A meeting has been convened by the Mayor,
to discuss the political aspect which this letter throws open.
Ballttbim.—As the eyes of Europe are now fixed on the Election
which will take place in this flourishing Irish town next Tuesday, a
few atoms of the political gossip floating about cannot fail to be of
interest to our readers. Mr. Mollonet's party, it is currently re-
ported, have undermined the Town Hall with gunpowder, which
will be ignited should the Mayor declare an adverse poll, while Mr.
Slooney has made every preparation to blow Mr. Mollonet's shop
and dwelling-house off the face of the earth with dynamite, in case it
goes against him. Both sides are very confident, and well armed with
revolvers. The registered number of Voters is 597; but, owing to Mr.
Mollonet's side having cut the gas off last night at a Meeting held
by Slooney's party at the " Shamrock and Traitor," and afterwards
applied a torch to the escape, the number now only mutters 583.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [March h, 1885.
PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
THE SUSPICIOUS BKIEF BAG.
When business is slack at Chambers, as sometimes happens, I do
not visit the Temple for days together. On these occasions the
intimate and excellent friend with whom I share my rooms under-
takes to telegraph to me if anything turns up of a gratifying
character, such as a brief endorsed with you the Attorney-General,
or a request to attend professionally before a Committee of the
House of Commons. My friend, with a kindness I cannot sufficiently
acknowledge, personally assumes the dutyof communicating with me,
thus relieving my Clerk of a very heavy responsibility. I, on the
other hand, am careful to leave at home a list of my movements for
the day, so that any telegraphic message that may arrive from Pump-
Handle Court may be transmitted to me with the least possible
delay, thus guarding against any loss of time on the part of Sir
Henry James or the Parliamentary Committee, should the first
wish instantly to consult with me anent a difficult point of law, or
the last desire to hear me immediately on the merits of a Railway
Bill. It is a matter of some regret to me having attained this perfect
organisation, that as yet no circumstances have ooourred enabling
me to put its merits to the test. But although I am not unfre-
quently away from mv Chambers, I am scarcely ever separated
from my Brief Bag. This useful article is constantly with me, and,
as now and then it is not quite full of professional legal docu-
ments, I use it for carrying other things.
One afternoon I was walking through the Strand on my way home
with my usual companion (on this occasion it was concealing from
view a small barrel of Blue Point Oysters—it was my birthday),
when I was confronted by a young man who stared at me with a
fixedness which attracted my attention. I fancied I had seen his
face somewhere before, hut could not remember the place or the
occasion. In like manner he appeared to half recognise me.
Suddenly his eyes rested upon my Brief Bag, when a gleam of intense
intelligence appeared to illumine his face, and he stepped back with
a sort of deferential proprietorship in my movements which aug-
mented my curiosity.
No doubt I should have thought little of this inoident had not I
met the same young man' a day or two afterwards, when he again
appeared to recognise me as one having direct claims upon his careful
attention. I happened to be talking at the time to a very old friend
of my father's (the venerable Mr. Dunup, who, it will be remem-
bered, gave up his profession as a Barrister to realise a considerable
fortune as the lucky inventor and patentee of " the Save-all Sausage
Maobine"), and he, too, noticed that the person seemed to be
watching me.
"You know, my boy," said Mr. Dunup, "that, years and years
ago, I used to praotise at the Old Bailey P"
I bowed. I remembered that there was a tradition that my old
friend had once held a brief in that august assembly—as somebody's
"devil," and in that character had addressed a jury in impassioned
accents for the defenoe. The legend went on to say, that his flow of
eloquenoe was suddenly interrupted on that occasion by a boot
ungratefully hurled at him by his own client.
Well," continued Mr. Duirup, confidentially, "as a retired Old
Bailey Counsel, I should call that man a Detective."
A Detective I Of course! I saw the whole thing at a glance. At
this very moment the Royal Courts were surrounded by the Polioe,
on account of recent ocourrenoes at Westminster and the Tower;
but surely there was no reason why I should be suspeoted! And
then I guiltily remembered my Brief Bag, in which even then were
resting certain household commissions, purchased at the Co-operative
Stores.
I determined that the next time I met my watcher I would address
him, telling him that his labour was in vain. The opportunity soon
offered. I had been to Covent Garden Market (where I had picked
up at a low figure a very fine water melon), and was making for the
Strand. He touched his hat as I stopped him.
"Sir," said he, in a tone of polite authority, "you must let me
take that bag from you."
This continued my suspicions—the fellow was a Detective.
"No doubt you know what it contains?" I observed, with
withering sarcasm.
"Of course, Sir—briefs," he answered. He was quite serious.
Had he mocked me at that moment with a smile, I believe I should
have felled him to the ground.
"Look here, my man," I cried, "very likely you mean well, and
are performing what you consider to be your duty, but you are
labouring under a mistake. As for the bag, it is my property, not
yours, and any attempt you may make to seize it I shall oppose
—with force!" And turning on my heel, I left him, seemingly
transfixed with astonishment.
After this outburst, when the person next saw me he seemed to
shrink away at my approaoh. No doubt he considered me a dan-
gerous character, who could not be arrested single-handed. Either
by accident or design we were continually meeting. I attempted to
avoid him, visiting unusual haunts, such as my Robing Room at the
Royal Courts, but without success. I even paid a visit to my
Chambers, and found that no doubt having ascertained that I was
coming, he had contrived to gain admittance to my Clerk's room.
When I was once safely caged, he disappeared. I had made up my
mind to oonsult my friend and fellow-tenant in common about the
best oourse to be pursued, but learned, to my great regret, that he
was away on Cirouit. His Clerk (and indeed mine, for we share one
between us, although I must confess I do not require his services
very frequently) had left the Chambers, so I was told, a few minutes
after I nad entered them. So, unable to advise with those best
qualified to consult with me, I determined to act on my own un-
divided responsibility. I put myself in communication with the
Police, and found of oourse that they knew nothing of the matter.
However I received a hint that sometimes Dublin acted without
regard to London.
Having thus paved the way for a settlement, I determined to bring
things to a crisis. One evening I was walking in the neighbourhood
of my Chambers, and came suddenly upon the man I had now
learned to regard as my persecutor, in a passage ending in a nil
de sac.
"Be good enough to listen to me calmly." I said, composedly.
"Now I may as well tell vou at once that I have made inquiries in
Scotland Yard, and you are not known there."
"I should hope not!" he exclaimed, in a tone apparently of
extreme astonishment. Then he cried, almost apnealingly, "But,
please, Sir, what made you ask about me at Scotland Yard?
"I was determined to sever the painful connection that has existed
between us now for some time as speedily as possible, and I called in
the Polioe—the London Polioe," I repeated, with emphasis, "to assist
me."
"I am sure I have always done my duty," he expostulated, with
emotion.
"From your'point of view no doubt you have," I replied, in a
judioial tone that was pleasing to me—I oould not help reflecting
that I had within me the materials of a really very passable Judge.
"Not improbably your purpose is praiseworthy enough. And feel-
ing this, I am going to treat you with perfect candour. I am going
to make a statement, and then ask you a question. My statement
is this: I am a highly respectable Barrister, enjoying considerable
practice—I repeat, considerable praotioe."
Here I paused to watch the effect of this assertion, which I do not
think I should have ventured to have made to a Londoner who knew
me. The man seemed surprised.
"And now, Sir, for my question. I have told you frankly my
status. I must trouble you, in your turn, to be good enough to
inform me what position you happen to occupy."
I said this with much dignity. The answer I received was so un-
expected that with it I must bring this paper to a conclusion, merely
remarking that the reply, I subsequently discovered, was perfectly
accurate.
"Why, please, Sir," cried my companion, thus interrogated,
"don't you know me P 1 am your own Clerk!"
A. Briefless, Junior.
WAITING ANSWER.
(A few Previous Questions—selected.)
If Mr. Gladstone does not, as he put it to Mr. Sexton, continue
"to be responsible for the direction of public affairs "—
Will Lord Salisbury step into his shoes on the spot, and give
Europe all round " a bit of his mind"?
Will Europe, in its present temper, do anything but smile plea-
santly if he does?
Will he, noting this, think twice of the Estimates, and, like many
worthier men before him, quietly, but finally, eat his own words P
Will he, however, whatever "happens in this direction, as a pre-
cautionary measure, make Sir Stafford Northcote "Permanent
Governor-General" of the Society Islands?
Will he also offer, as a fitting reward to "the Party" for recent
service, the Irish Viceroyship to Mr. Redmond?
Will he ask Lord Randolph Churchill to stop on his way home
at Suakim, and see what he can do, till further notice, with the
"Civil Governorship of Eordofan " P
Will he have Lord Northbrooe, as a warning to future unima-
ginative Lords of the Admiralty, really beheaded with some ceremony
on Tower Hill?
Will he, with a business-like eye to conciliating powerful mino-
rities, joyfully make Mr. Bradlaugh his Lord Chancellor?
Will he, when he gets into power, if he continue to talk so much
about the destinies of this great Empire, prove such a "thing of
joy " to the trusting British taxpayer P
And, finally, will he, take him all in all, turn out to be at such a
crisis, a bit better for the place than Mr. Gladstone P

KEDISTKIBUTION OF TAXES.
(In view of the Approaching Requirement of Raising the Wind.)
As existing circumstances in Egypt, if not also on the frontiers of
Afghanistan, necessitate for the present, if not indefinitely, the
abeyance of a policy of Peace, the idea of Retrenchment and Reform
most, until tie return of better times, altogether yield to the
question of Ways and Means. Of course that may be solved simply
by another turn of the screw on that portion of the community
already subject to Indirect Taxation. But this expedient entails a
certain disadvantage. It costs people of ordinary morality a some-
what painful effort of conscientiousness to pay even their just debts
unless they know they must, and any Tax imposed upon them which
they think partial or otherwise inequitable they are too apt to be
unscrupulous enough to try and evade if they dare. Sad, very sad,
but so it is. Hence it may be desirable to supplement Indirect
Taxation, as it stands, by some new Taxes of which the evasion will
be impossible, or at least very difficult. As for example, there may be
proposed for consideration to the Chancellor of the Exchequer :—
A Marriage-Tax. Why not? Already there exist Death Taxes
—the Probate and Succession Duties. Mural Advertisements Tax.
Railway Station Advertisement Tax,—very heavy.
A Perambulator Tax. To which might conveniently be added :—
A Rattle Tax, as, likewise, a Doll Tax, a Top Tax, a Hoop Tax,
and a Noisy Toy Tax. A Rocking-Horse Tax, and Taxes upon all
sorts and kinds of children's nursery carriages, so as to educate
the children up to payment for luxuries.
A Tax on Photographs of Celebrities—cela va tans dire.

Let Erin remember each oraze of old,
Now her foremost foes invade her,
America send the dollar of gold
In the sacred task to aid her;
To aid her see all her banners are furled—
Let who will not look out for danger;—
Turn the emerald gem to a brick to be hurled
At the helpless head of the Stranger.
When far from the revels the Home-Ruler strays,
Whiskey hot, whiskey cold, declining,
He '11 dream of the glories of other days,
And scorn the low joys of dining!

answer to questions from Parnellites. Motive amiable, but result
undesirable. Lord Edmund Fitzmaukice, replying to questions on
matters of Imperial interest never takes half the time Camtbell-
Bannebman appropriates for explaining to Joseph Olllis or Kenny
the circumstances under which Tim Doolan had his head broken, or
those attending refusal of the application of Bridget Mubpht,
Charwoman at the Ballyforran workhouse, for an increase in her
salary. No use complaining of Irish Members wasting public time
with frivolous questions, if Irish Secretary assists them with verbose
answers.
But about the Boots. Campbell-Bannebhan explained at some
length that Local Government Board do not agree with Dr. Fleming,
though at present they have no intention of hanging him. Then
Macabtney interposes, and, with high sarcasm, asks, in connection
with this question of pauper children going barefooted, whether
children of vast number of Irish ratepayers don't go barefooted?
"Yah! yah!" bawls Callan. "Aren't the majority of the
Guardians in favour of keeping children barefooted constituents of
Macartney f"
"Whirroo!" cries Sexton. "If the children of ratepayers go
barefooted, isn't it because their parents have to pay rack-rent P"
Then from the other side of the House rises Mitchell-Henry,
and, with exoruoiatingly grave air, asks whether it is not usual for
grown-up people in Irish country districts to cany their shoes and
stockings in their hands, and put them on when they get near a
town?

well lately. At-
tention absorbed
by advances of Henry the Tyler to position of Universal Provider
(of wisdom and counsel). Rather forgotten our young friend. Turns
up unexpectedly, but effectively, to-night. Suddenly awakened
to iniquity of Bengal Tenancy Bill. A real Maharajah has tele-
graphed to him to save India. Misfortune is, Maxwell never before
heard of Bengal Tenancy Bill. Knows nothing of facts. This
would deter ordinary man; but Herbert young, and high-spirited.
Perhaps House wouldn't know any more, and he might get along.
So ran down, gave hurried notioe to J. K. Cross that storm was
coming; passed the word amongst delighted Conservatives that
forty of them would presently be wanted to support motion for
Adjournment, and then took breath. When time came, asked leave
to move Adjournment, "in order to discuss matter of urgent publio
importance.
'Has Ait Baba got his Forty Companions?" asked the Speaker,
entering into fun of the thing. Whereupon sixty or seventy
Members rose, including Parnellites, which made the matter more
than ever mixed. Bengal Tenanoy Bill dimly understood to be
kind of Irish Land Act. Parnellites now acting with Conservatives
to oppose Bill.
Maxwell got on admirably, to start with. "It may," he said,
opening his Bpeech, "appear presumptuous on my part —at which
uproarious cheer came from Liberal side, which rather abashed the
Baronet. Effect only temporary, though later began to wish he'd
stopped at home, and gone on with his Treatise exposing the ignor-
ance and general untrustworthiness of Adam Smith. Astonished to
hear from George Campbell and Macfablanb that the Bill he
understood introduced only three weeks ago been incessantly before
the country for five or six years. Remorse deepened at drawing the
blameless James Lowther into the mire.
"Disgraceful," cried that champion of popular rights, " to attempt
to pass such a Bill before it has been translated into the vernacular."
"Which vernacular f" Macfarlane asked; and James began to
think that possibly India was not like England, with one common
language.
On the whole, a bad three-quarters of an hour for Maxwell.
Climax reached when Sir George Campbell came down on him.
"House knows nothing of the question," said the ex-Lieutenant-
Governor of Bengal, " least of all the Member who introduces it.
Why," cried Sir Geobge, uplifting his tuneful voice, "J don't
understand it myself!" At which Liberals and Conservatives,
momentarily sinking party feeling, depreoatingly shook their heads,
and murmured, "Oh yes f oh yes I"

Maxwell humbly asked leave to withdraw Motion for Adjourn
ment. House wouldn't let him, so it was negatived.
"Not sure, after all," said Maxwell, meditatively, "that it isn't
almost as well to know something about a question before taking
extreme course of interfering with public business in order to make
a speech upon it."
Business done.—Sir H. Maxwell snubbed. Progress with Seats
Bill.
Wednesday.—In Committee on thelSeats Bill. Ulster Members
want Bill amended in their interest. Stafford Nohthcote in
lamentable quandary. Can't support his friends without breaking
compact with the Government, so sits on Bench making as little of
himself as possible, and occasionally turning sympathetic face upon
Mulholland and; the rest. Macartney declared himself "dis-
couraged, disappointed, and disgusted," with his leaders. But
nothing came or it, or of other Amendments submitted.
"What a farce all this is," says William Agnew. "Here's Bill
settled in every particular. No Amendment can possibly be aooepted;
Jet we sit here hour after hour talking, and sometimes voting,
light as well have a holiday and go and see the pictures."
Thrilling speech from Orh Ewing; something to do with burghs
in Scotland. But real excitement of afternoon out in the Lobby.
Telegram arrives announcing Liberal victory in West Gloucester-
shire. Liberals throw up their hats and cheer. Conservatives look
contemptuous.
"Not much of a place, West Gloucestershire. You had the seat
before, and may as well keep it."
Ten minutes later another telegram. First one all a mistake.
Akkks, your friend, not Marling. Then Conservatives oheer.
Liberals, for their part, always knew Akees would get in. Quite
safe thine for him from the first. Telegram Number Three.
"Mailing's the man, not Akers." Neither side give themselves
up to demonstration this time. Observe attitude of being equal to
either fate. Telegram Number Four. "It's certainly Akees.

"Now reelly, don't you know, this is very distressing," said
Christopher Sykes. "Almost ruffles a man. Now which is in,

"Both," says Thornhux. "It's a case of Double
Business done.—Seats Bill in Committee.
Thursday.—Herbert Maxwell rises to explain. J. K. Cross
been reading telegram from Viceroy, which makes Maxwell's feat
of Tuesday more ridiculous than ever. Young man has evidently
been the victim of a wily native, who has played upon his ingenu-
ousness. That is hard to bear. But Maxwell most distressed at
reference to the telegram. Cross said he asked him for it on Tues-
day, and was answered that he'd left it at home.
What does Under-Secretary mean by this? Does he insinuate
that there never was a telegram, and that it's Maxwell, not the
Maharajah, who's been inventing things P This will never do, so
Maxwell rises, and begs leave to make personal statement. House
instantly quiet. Perhaps he's going to confess he knew nothing
about the Bengal Tenancy Bill, and to apologise for taking up time
of House. Possibly he's going to " blow " on the Maharajah, who
got him into mess. But it's only about the telegram he's going to
speak. Graver in aspect than ever, and with a tear in his curious
throat-voice, the Baronet explains:
"The Hon. Gentleman," he said, more in sorrow than in anger,
"did not ask me for the telegram till after dinner."
Ribald House went off into convulsions of laughter.
"Why didn't he ask me before dinner?" the Scotch Baronet
adds, wanting to argue the matter with this incomprehensibly laugh-
ing crowd. House, for its part, saw it all. Cross coming up to
ordinarily staid Baronet at Eleven o'Clock at night:
"Let's have a look at the telegram from the Maharajah," says he.
"What Mahawajah, ole fellah? Don't know her. Shtelegram?
Watdyemean? Cross, ole man, you've been drinking."
But it was nothing of the kind. Sir Herbert only meant to indi-
cate that he'd gone home, dressed for dinner, and left the telegram
in the pocket of his morning coat. But never since explanations
began was so simple a process brought to knowledge of the House in
bo mysterious and portentous a manner.
Business done.—Supplementary Estimates voted.
Friday.—Granville's smile always soothing—quite beatific to-
night. The Markiss has been beaten—absolutely routed! Brought
in a Bill to authorise body of Capitalists to advance money on grow-
ing crops, with preferential rights as creditors. Dead silence on
Conservative benches. Opposition from Liberals. Redesdale pays
off old scores by going for Markiss's little Bill. Markiss throws
little Bill to the wolves, and displays great anxiety to get on with
the next business.

A VERY UNCOMMON COUNCILMAN!
One of that wondrous race the Common Council of the City of
London has written to the Times—and, wonderful to relate, the Times
has inserted the marvellous specimen of inflated vanity—stating that
unless the name of the Prime Minister be erased from the list of the
Committee that has been formed for the purpose of providing a
National Memorial to General Gordon, he will do—what do our
amused readers imagine ?—actually refuse to vote for a contribution
for any such purpose from the funds of the Corporation! Only
think!
There are, we believe, some two hundred Common Councilmen,
and perhaps it is hardly fair to take this hunter after notoriety as a
fair speoimen. Let ns rather hope that he is a solitary exception;
in other words, the Biggar of the Corporation.
With his Scotch name he possibly possesses Scotch proclivities,
and will be glad of the opportunity of withholding his own small
contribution; but it would be an insult to the Corporation to fancy
that suoh mere twaddle would prevent them from showing their
wonted liberality.
Strange to say, we have not heard that the Lord Mayor has
elded to the threat of the irate Common Counsellor, who probably
this time thoroughly repents of his almost incredible folly.

Stirring a Peg.
A STAGE WHISPER.
No playgoer should miss the present opportunity of seeing Masks
and Facet at the Haymarket. I saw the Play years ago, with Mrs.
Stirling as Peg, and a Miss Julia Bennett as Mabel Vane.
When first I saw sweet Peggy,
T'was at the Market (Hay);
and very distinctly do I remember Mrs. Stirling in the part.
I recollect her sparkling laugh, the action of her hand, her dance,
and how she played the Actress to the life, at the expense—at least
this is my impres-
sion now—of the
Woman. Yet, after
a study of the
vivacious Peggy's
history, I am in-
clined to think that
she was a born
Actress, and that
what might have
been genuine woman
in her had very little
chance. "Theshal-
low pot is soon hot,"
and of deep feeling
she seems to have
been incapable,
With her, eaoh love
had a short life, and
a merry one, till
some catastrophe
came, bringing with
it rage, recrimina-
tion—a sharp storm,
and quickly over. A
sprightly, witty woman, impulsive for good or for evil,—a tender-
hearted, kindly-natured, uneducated Bohemian,—such was the real
Peg Woffington; and Messrs. Charles Reade and Tom Taylor as
Novelist and Dramatist, dealt, on the whole, very fairly with her,
and have not credited her with more good qualities than just
suited their purpose.
Mrs. Bancroft's Peg is the Woffington to the life in the green
room of the First Act, and is the Woffington, again to the life, in the
airs she gives herself when doing the honours of Ernest Vane's
house, and cutting out her sharp-tongued rival, Kitty Clive. When
her lover's wife appears, and Peg discovers that the "young man
from the country " has succeeded in obtaining from her a return of
his passion,—to use such a word as " love " is to profane it in such a
case,—on false pretences, nothing could be better, except that the
action here is unnecessarily delayed, than the manner of Mrs. Ban-
croft's La Woffington wounded in her amour propre, and duped in
the presence of her dear friends, who she knew would be only too
delighted to tell the story against her everywhere. Had they been
alone, Peg would have given full vent to her anger, but in a seoond
she grasps the situation, skilfully turns the laugh against her lover,
and converts her defeat as a Woman into a triumph for the Actress.
If her affair with Garrick had taken place before this, what an
occasion for little Davy to express contemptuous pity for his dis-
carded mistress. Be this as it may, Peg was as heart-whole at the
end of the Vane intrigue as ever she was before it, and if she shed
any tears at all, they were the
effect of chagrin and disappoint-
ment. At the end of the Act she
gives way to sentimental emo-
tion, most natural in Peg, when
the injured Mabel Vane informs
her that for the rest of her days
she shall look upon the woman
who has stolen her husband from
her, and restored him to her
again, damaged goods, and with
the freshness off, as " her sister."
This is theatrical claptrap, and
was probably introduced as giving
a touch of goody-goodiness to
Peg't character, by way of con-
cession to the weakness of a
British audience.
Mrs. Bancroft at the last so
enlists our sympathies for
are angry with Mabel, the lav
inconsiderate as to take her husband away from "so delightful, so
charming, so perfect a companion. For we have seen Peggy at her
best; doing works of mercy, feeding the hungry, darning the clothes

Fusbos " from Bombastes Furioso.
as the wronged woman, that we
wife, for being so unkind and
of the threadbare poet.—really very bad taste in the presence of Mr.
Triplet's wife,—and cheering an unhappy family. It is just what a
Peg Woffington or a Nell Gtcyn would nave done. Only, the better
Mrs. Bancroft plays, the more credit she induces the audience to give
Peg for goodness—and—and, I may add, virtue, so much the more
regrettable does the conduct of that spotless ninny Mabel appear in
coming up from the country so inopportunely, in upsetting people
who were getting on so well without her, and in taking away her
husband in the most selfish manner possible from the only woman
whom he has ever loved. The finer the acting of Mrs. Bancroft,
according to the light in which the authors wished their Peg to be
regarded, the worse must it be for the moral of the play.
In the old piece, all this mock-sentiment was, if I remember rightly,
inart ist ically knocked on the head by a rhyming epilogue. It is not so
now; we leave, admitting
that Ernest Vane was a
weak fool, feeling no sort
of sympathy for his wife
Mabel, but really pitying
their poor ill-used victim,
Peg Woffington! Indeed,
some of the audience go so
far as to hope that she will
soon be consoled by accept-
ing Sir Charles Poman-
der's offer, until, or unless,
she gets a better.
As Triplet, Mr. Ban-
croft, in all the pathetic
scenes, is admirable; and
if he wouldn't laugh in a
manner suggestive of a
gentleman who has cracked
his voice in trying to imi-
tate Lieutenant Cole, the
Ventriloquist, and who has only succeeded in getting the right pitch
for "Tommy " on the roof, but can't get him down again, he would
be perfeot. The writing of the Triplet scenes is the best part of
the excellent dialogue of this Comedy, which, from beginning to end,
seems to have been most carefully considered, and Mr. Bancroft's
rendering of the part is one of the best things we have seen for a
considerable time.
Snarl and Soaper are overdone, and might just as well do a bur-
lesque dance together whenever they exeunt as go through such
eccentric pantomimic action as they now do. It is, of course, funny,
but it is out of place in a comedy of real life. I thought Colley
Cibber very good. If he was at all overdone, the answer seems to
me to be that Colley Cibber was overdone. The weak part of the
Comedy is that portion of its dialogue which is intended to represent
the repartee and sarcasm of the period. It lacks the polish which is
characteristic of the School for Scandal, and is simply rudeness. As
it is " positively for the last time," I strongly advise all playgoers
to see Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft as Triplet and Peg Woffington, or
they will repent having missed a real treat. N ibbs.

THE CHARGE OF THE FIVE HUNDRED.
The Treasurer of the Kyrle Society, writing to the Times, says
that " A landowner in South-East London is on the point of handing
over to the Eyrie Society two acres of freehold land, to be held in
trust for the public, and kept open and unbuilt on for ever. The
land is at Deptford, in the midst of a poor and populous neigh-
bourhood, inhabited mainly by those employed in riverside work."
In the gift, it seems, is included a building containing a large
concert-hall, with class and lecture rooms, and arrangements for
providing refreshment.
Here is a chance! To make the best use of it, the Kyrle Society
estimates a fund of £500 will be required. It ought to be forth-
coming. That admirable lady, Octavia Hill, will gladly receive
donations at 14, Nottingham Place, W. Who will "tip" this
particular Hill with gold, or even silver? Five hundred donors at a
Eound apiece would do it. Now, then, "Noble Five Hundred,"
ere is a "charge" for you worth undertaking, and, duly done,
perhaps as well worth celebrating in Tennysonian numbers as many
themes to which the Poet-Laureate has put his silver pen.

H.M.S. "STAGNATION."
Atimtrat.tt Duet.
Sung Nightly, with the greatest enthusiasm, by the
First Lord and his Chief Secretary.
Do ye want to know what's a first-class craft
For a home or a foreign station?
Why then, come rive a look, Mates, fore and aft,
At Her Majesty's Ship Stagnation.
Every inch of her hull's our own design:
Her plates are as thick as a wafer;
While her helt, just down to the water-line,
Makes her cheaper, my Mates,—and safer I
Then her how and stern are planned with a skill
That should rouse an enemy's wonder;
For as soon as they 're hit they '11 quietly fill,
Come off in a lump, and go under.
No matter :—the moment peril she spots,
She can heap on her coals in plenty.
And make, at high pressure, her thirteen knots,
While the foe that's in chase makes twenty.
And if through her boilers a shell goes clean,
And she's foroed to offer resistance,
She '11 run out her guns,—when the fact she '11 glean
That they won't carry half the distance.
What '■ the odds? Old-fashioned,
On inquiry, searching, judioial,
Let them burst! Why not? Don't they serve their friend,
The permanent Woolwich Official!
"With ships and with guns,—not as these, of yore
Did Nelson make all Europe caper P"
That's true; and these here, by which we set store,
Exist only yet, Mates—on paper!
But contracts are placed; and, fifty years hence,
If work goes on fairishly steady,
Should ten be required for sudden defence,
It's possible one may be ready!
And she '11 be, my Mates, quite a first-class craft,
And a credit to this here nation;
So let the salt breezes three stout cheers waft
For " Her Majesty's Ship Stagnation!"

PUBLIC GRIEVANCES.
(By Our Own Inspector?)
No. TIL—Music, that hath no charms.
Perhaps the most surprising fact that I have learnt during my
three months' experiences of the grievances under which the Public
labour in the Metropolis, is, that one of the most irritating, if not
maddening, of them is caused by a superabundance in quantity, or
a feebleness in quality, or an enforced endurance, of the beautiful
art of Music From almost every condition of life, the cry is the
same, " Save, oh save us from this awful infliction!" To most of the
other grievances of life the weary soul seems to become somewhat
reconciled by constant iteration, out in this particular instance the
increase of torture seems to grow by what it feeds on,
I subjoin a few selected specimens :—
Sir,—1 read your reports with much interest, but smile bitterly at
what your correspondents consider grievances when compared to
mine. I am a man of quiet and regular habits, somewhat addicted
to study, and an occasional contributor to some of our scientific
periodicals. Ten years ago I bought myself a house, which, I venture
to Bay, is as perfect a specimen of a single gentleman's residence as
can be found anywhere. _ My next-door neighbour, for all that time,
was a very old friend, with similar tastes to my own, and, our houses
being semi-detached, we were enabled to live in a perfect rapture of
repose. My poor friend passed to his peaceful rest six months ago,
and his house was almost immediately taken possession of by a
large, a robust, a gushing, musical family. What I have had to
endure since then I can never fully describe. The three sitting-
rooms have each an instrument of torture in the shape of a Piano
Forte, in all three cases I should say a Forte rather than a Piano—
and one or other is always thundering out some fearful specimen of
what is called the Music of the Future—oh! would it were!—some-
thing chaotic, without form and void, and apparently without end,
for I hear the heavy fat fingers pounding away from an early hour of
the morning, when what 1 believe is called practice" begins, till
quite a late hour at night, by which time some two or three brother
or sister lunatics have dropped in to join in the merciless infliction
on their half-maddened neighbour. Then begin the Glees that
bring no glee to me, the Part Songs with all parts bad alike, and
Choruses that seem to shake the very thin walls of my sober dwelling,
till I rush to my lonely couch to try to find in sleep that peace denied
to me in my waking hours. C. P. B.
Sir,—I umbly begs pardon if I am thort for to be intruding, but,
as we all knows as Waiters rushes in where Pleaoemen fears to tread,
bo posserbly, wot many of our Paytrons thinks as great a greevance
as we does, none on 'em has the pluck for to menshun. I eludes to
the singing at our grand City Bankwets. One would natrally fancy
that arter having dewoured a jolly good gratooitus dinner, with
nothing to pay, excep the Waiters, and drunk as muoh fine old gine-
rous Wine as prudence dicktates, sumtimes jest a lee tie more, and
on the same liberal terms, that, as a kind of indoor releaf to the
hawful speeches—as seems a sort of purgatory to go thro' as neces-
sary for to condone the hoffence of having so artily in joyed oneself—
that the Songs, and setterer, as was sung, would be of a nice cheerful
karacter, such as would raze your spemts and send you home smilin
and appy. But what do we And, or rayther, what do we hearP
Why, the werry saddest, and meloucollyest, and art-breakingest
songs as can possibly be found outside a lunatick Asylum, such as
"The children a dying in the garden," and "the Hash Grove,"
where sumboddy's Hashes is laid, and the lost Cord," as will never

Sib,—I live in a London Square, a nice quiet Square, with beauti-
ful trees, mossy turf, and flowering shrubs, and delightful gates
at each entrance to keep out everything that is noisy, and low, and
vulgar. There is a rumour looming in the distance—if I may be
allowed the metaphor—that a Society of Semi-lunatics are contem-
plating the removal of our gates of Eden; but this is, of course, too
absurd even for these terribly levelling times. No, Sir—level down,
if you will, our gracious, and noble, and right honourable Aristo-
cracy, the pride of every true-born Briton, to the level of the mere
professors of Law, Physio, and Divinity, and level up, if you will,
our mere working-classes to the level of our patrons of the Turf, or
the Stock Exchange, but restrain the unhallowed hand that would
level down our quiet-preserving gates. But to return to my subject.
It goes without saying—as we say in Paris—that all those offensive
sounds that are produced by Organs, Brass Bands, Negroes, and
similar instruments of torture, are rigidly excluded from our haven
of rest, and up to last Midsummer we were all quiet, contented, and
happy. How can 1 fully describe our subsequent torture? A Lady
who, apparently, had no evil designs upon our much-prized tran-
quillity—for Bhe was fairly good-looking, and apparently good-
natured—took the large house of our quiet Square, and actually
opened it as a Singing School for Young Ladies! The weather
being warm, and the Pupils numerous, the windows were constantly
open, and " from morn to dewy eve, a summer day," as Milton says,
scream succeeded scream, shriek succeeded shriek, and Discord, dire
sister, reigned supreme. When welcome Winter brought frost and
cold, the windows were closed, and our lives became endurable
again; but on an unusually warm day last week we had another
foretaste of the coming joy (!) which we may expect to have to
endure when it recommences in earnest, for six or seven months.
As you, Sir, doubtless, know everything, will you kindly inform me
if 1 should be within my legal rights if I were to engage a particu-
larly brassy brass band to play opposite my house, which is next
door to the squalling Academy, say for some four hours daily, when
I am away on my professional avocations, or can 1 prosecute the
Lady Professor as a public nuieance for poisoning our pure atmo-
sphere " with piercing shrieks and screams, and sounds unholy?"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [Mahoh 21, 1885.
PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
MY "FAIB" CLIENT.
Although I am quite prepared to admit that several Members of
the Profession to which I have the honour to belong: have more
praotioe than myself, still I decline to acknowledge that any one of
them, from the Attorney-General down to the Junior who has been
called scarcely a score of years, has a greater, a sinoerer regard for
legal etiquette. I pride myself upon my strict observance of the
best traditions of the Bar, and would not for worlds interfere with a
Solicitor's privileges.
With these principles firmly implanted in my heart, I was a little
startled, some time during the last Autumn Vacation, by being
accosted in the Temple Gardens by a Lady of imposing appearance
ishe looked like Juno in a Tam-O'Shanter), who wished to learn " if
were Mr. Briefless?"
"Pardon me," said the Lady, resting herself on one of the seats
direotly in front of Crown Office Row, and imperiously motioning me
to sink down beside her, "but I am very anxious to consult you
professionally."
_ This was embarrassing. I am not accustomed to being seen tete-
a-tete with Ladies of imposing appearance, as I prefer, when I have
a female companion, to let that female companion be my wife, who,
I frankly confess, has an extremely jealous disposition. Again, I
am naturally shy, save when appearing before a Judge in Chambers
to support an unopposed application—then, indeed, the responsibility
of my mission gives me the courage of a lion. But here I was not
before one of their Lordships in a private room, but in the open
air, with a detachment of the Inns of Court Bine Volunteers " de-
ploying," or performing some equally intricate military evolution,
directly in front of me. However, I submitted.
"Yes, Mr. Briefless," continued my Juno-like companion, with
considerable gesticulation, "I am tired of Solicitors, and I have
determined to come to the fountain head—to instruct my own
Counsel without the assistance of an intermediary."
Of course this statement was extremely gratifying to my personal
vanity—it is pleasing to be considered the fountain-head of the Law
—and I could not help smiling. I regretted that I had shown this
emotion immediately after I had exhibited it, as I noticed that my
expression had been observed and evidently misunderstood by two
skirmishers of the Rifles, who belonged to my own Inn, and who
were making a demonstration (they were pretending to shoot at us)
in front of the bench upon which we were seated. Seeing this, I
assumed my heaviest frown and rose to my feet.
"Madam," I exolaimed,"you are surely aware that, if you want
to consult me, it mutt be through a Solioitor?"
"I know nothing of the sort," she returned angrily, and to my
intense annoyance and confusion, the Juno-like lady showed
symptoms of having what is colloquially termed "a regular row"
with me. I felt that this would be open to even further miscompre-
hension by the now grinning skirmishers, so I hastened to offer her
explanations.
Pray do not think I wish to aot uncourteously," I said, reseating
myself apologetically and nervously beside her, "but I am only
explaining to you the etiquette of the profession."
Did not Queen Elizabeth consult Lord Bacon f" she asked,
in a tone of extreme irritation.
I was foroed to admit that I had heard of the precedent, but I gave
it as my deliberate opinion, that her late Majesty had only held
these consultations prior to the commencement of litigation.
"But I have not got to that stage as yet," she argued, angrily:
"when I do, it will be time to talk about the lawyers. Surely until
then yon have no right to refuse me as a olient f'
I did not know what to say. I had scruples about refusing a
client—I have always scruples in refusing a olient—still, my inner
consciousness counselled me to have nothing to do with this parti-
cular case. As I have already hinted my wife is of an unwarrantably
jealous disposition.
"And now that that is settled," said the Lady, in a very deter-
mined voice, " we will come to business. I shall want your attention,
your most earnest attention, for at least an hour and a half."
This announcement was most awkward. I remembered that I had
an appointment within a quarter of an hour. (In fact I had pro-
mised to meet my wife at my Chambers, and then to accompany her to
the lawn tennis grounds in front of King's Bench Walk.) Recollecting
this, I summoned up sufficient resolution to say, that I could not
possibly accede to my self-constituted client's request at that
moment, as duty called me elsewhere.
"I hope this is not a subterfuge," she replied, looking fixedly at
me as if she would read my inmost thoughts. Then she added less
sternly, "Well, I want to have perfeot confidence in you, so aooept
your excuse. But first, can you give me two hours to-morrow?"
I replied in the negative, and strongly urged her to seek assistance
elsewhere.
"Mr. Briefless," replied the Lady resembling Juno in a Tam-
O'Shanter, firmly, "when my mind is made up it is adamant. If
you cannot immediately give me an appointment at the earliest date,
I ."shall seize the present opportunity tor explaining to you at full
length my grievances."
Thus pressed I was forced to consent, and suggested that, as my
Chambers were not very well adapted for consultation, we might
meet elsewhere. After some hurried (on my part, for the time for
meeting my wife had now been reached) discussion, it was settled
that our next consultation should be held on the following afternoon
on a penny steamboat on that part of the River Thames situaU d
between the piers of Waterloo and Blackfriars Bridge.
"And mind," she said, as she took her leave, if you are five
minutes late, I shall call for you at Pump-Handle Court!"
After this our consultations were of frequent occurrence. We
changed the locale on eaoh occasion, as my inner consciousness told
me that were I seen with her I should perhaps lay my conduct open
to misapprehension by the scandalous. As ladies seldom under-
stand matters of business, I was particularly anxious the matter
should not reach the ears of my wife. I cautiously selected places
of popular resort, so that secresy (which is the essence of fraud)
should be absent from our negotiations. At the same time, as I did
not wish to meet many—nay, any—of my friends, I affected those
neighbourhoods in which I was least likely to find them. Thus, one
day I spent a oouple of hours in the Chamber of Horrors at Madame
Tussaud's, on another occasion I passed a whole afternoon in the
Rare Prints' Department of the British Museum; and so on, and so
on. I helped my client as well as I could, consulting authorities
and explaining, by her particular request, in detail all the steps of
an action, so that she might know now to check the acts of her
Solicitor when she went to consult him.
As I had no very urgent cases in hand at the time, I threw my
whole heart and soul into the matter, and really found the affair
less disagreeable than' I at first had anticipated, as my client, on
better acquaintance, proved to be a person, not entirely devoid of a
sort of faded charm. The case would no doubt have become entirely
pleasing to me but for a rather serious domestio misunderstanding
arising from a chance meeting with a relative (a maiden aunt of
my wife's), when I was holding a consultation with my olient in
the Reptile House at the Zoological Gardens. However, even this
was partially cleared up when I explained that I had been there on
business whioh would ultimately lead to the holding of a brief. This
statement, I must confess, was not received with all the respect that
its veracity should have obtained for it. I felt that further proof
was a necessity, that my domestio tranquillity could only be thus
secured.
"By the way, to-morrow my case comes on for trial," said my fair
client at length—(I had not been permitted to see her for a fortnight
or three weeks)—as we paced side by side, by appointment with ner
(and by arrangement with my wife, who I could not help fancying
was watching us) up and down the eastern pavement of Westminster
Bridge. I need scarcely say I was delighted, for now I felt that I
had coming to me the last piece of evidence necessary to complete
my defence in the Court of my Hearth and Home.
"And who have you selected to brief me?" I asked, with a smile.
"You cannot do better than go to Ely Place, Staple or Clement's
Inn, Ludgate Hill, Essex Street, or Gray's Inn Square." And I
mentioned the names of well-known Solicitors dwelling in those
favourite localities.
"Brief you!" she eohoed, in a shrill tone of astonishment; and
then added a statement which filled me with genuine grief and indig-
nation; for I felt that in her person I had been guilty of breaches in
professional etiquette. She told me that, thanks to my instructions,
she had done entirely without a Solicitor so far, and thought I could
not conscientiously recommend her to instruct one at so advanced a
stage of the proceedings.
But," I objeoted, in a tone that I intended to oarry oonviction,
"if you don't instruot a Solioitor, you won't be able to brief me.
Don't you understand, Madam, you will be unable to brief me!
Then what will you do f"
"Why, appear in Person!" was the ready response.
And she did!

BEFORE THE CURTAIN.
iU&KLY, if ever, have Composer and Author produced piece after
piece under conditions so favourable to success as have Messrs.
Gilbert and Sullivan at the Savoy. They are their own Managers,
the theatre is
practically theirs,
the Members of
the Company,
from the soprano
and tenor down
to the latest
novice in the
chorus, or among
the "extras," de-
pend mainly, if
not entirely, upon
the Composer and
Author for their
engagements.
This Beaumont
and Fletcher of
Ecoentrio Opera
can'order rehear-
sals when they
choose, oan com-
mand the scene-
painters and pro-
perty-men, and,
what is much
more to the point,
be obeyed. They
have jointly and
separately the
authority of the
Centurion; the
Author is the autocrat of the acting and the Savoy stage generally;
the Composer is the autocrat of the music, vocal, and instrumental.
At other theatres an Author may try to assume the autocrat, but,
unless he can be absolutely independent, and able to take his piece out
of the theatre without damaging his chance of earning a livelihood,
the attempt is only a ridiculous and palpable failure. True that
times have changed, considerably for the better, since Albert Smith
said that" there was only one person in the theatre lower than the
call-boy, and that was the Author," yet, in spite of much improve-
ment, a young Dramatist 'will soon sympathise with the spirit of
Albert Smith's observation; and, ordinarily, the most experienced
Playwright, if not, as I have said, absolutely independent, has, in
almost every instance, to accommodate himself to the exigencies
of the theatre, and to the tempers of the Actors. From the moment
he has a piece in rehearsal, there is no peace for him on the Stage.
He is promised what he will never obtain; ne has to accept j ust what he
can get; he has to humour the ideas of others and sacrifice his own;
he has to make the best of unintentional mistakes and deliberately
intentional alterations; he has to accede to the Manager's date for
producing the piece, and its first night of public performance is, in
the majority of cases, really and truly only a dressed rehearsal, and,
in some cases, it is the first real rehearsal the piece has had.
Now nothing of this sort ought to take place at the Savoy. There
Messrs. Gilbert and Sullivan have only themselves to please, only
themselves and their piece to consider; they are monarohs of all they
Savoy,—I should say survey,"—they are masters of the situation,
ind if they allow any piece of theirs to be produced in a hurry, with
incomplete appointments, with inappropriate scenery, faulty dresses,
or after insufficient rehearsal, on their own heads be it and on no one
else's. The Actor-singers are only intelligent puppets in their
Showmen's hands, ana the more faithfully they carry out the
instruction given them by their masters, the greater their individual
and collective chance of success.
It delights me to see the preoision of the action on the Stage of
the Savoy, the result of a carefully thought-out plan and well-
regulated drill. The principals have been judiciously selected for
thelwork, and they are suited by the two clever fellow-workers who,
having taken their measure to a nicety, give them just what they
can do, and no more; and who insist on their original conceptions
being executed exactly according to their ideas. The result is
that the ensemble is about the most effective thing in London,—or
in Paris for that matter,—because the individuality of the Aotor-
singer is not destroyed, but is judiciously made use of, and worked
up, as valuable material for the character he has to represent.
With all these advantages and means to boot, a first night of a new
Eccentric Opera at the Savoy should be judged by a far higher
standard than a premiere elsewhere; less leniency should be shown
to shortcomings, which may be explained, but rarely excused.
The Mikado promises to be all that its successful predecessors have
been, though the first performance, whioh would have been good enough
anywhere else, was not quite up to the Savoy mark. It broke upon
many of us there, as quite a revelation, that our George Grossmith's
real humour had hitherto been less in his face and voice than in his
legs. Throughout the First Aot his legs were invisible, and the
audience felt that something was wanting; they didn't know exactly
what it was, but their favourite was not being funny. He didn't
even look funny. He had a good song; he got flustered in the words;
was nervous; but all this could have been forgiven him if he had
only been funny,—just once. But no, the Aot went on, and all
Mr. Grossmith's admirers were what Jeames called " non-plushed."
Suddenly, in the Second Aot, he gave a kick-up, and showed a pair of
white-stocking'd legs under the Japanese dress. It was an inspira-
tion. Forthwith, the house felt a strong sense of relief,—it had
got what it wanted, it had found out accidentally what it had really
missed, and at the first glimpse of George Grossmith's legs there
arose a shout of long pent-up laughter. George took the hint j he,
too, had found out where the fault lay, and now he was so pleased
at the discovery that he couldn't give them too much of a good
thing. Rich wtn, I mean George, was himself again. There was
life in the old dog yet. So at it he went, up he kicked and twisted,
like the celebrated Old Joe, in the nigger song, who performed the
difficult feat of "kicking up behind and before," and the Audience
shouted, applauded, encored, and actually joined in the action,
unconsciously kicking up their own legs in their irrepressible delight,
much after the manner of a less aristocratic and well-bred audience,
which gives vent to its feelings by chorusing a popular tune sung
by one of their favourites.
From that time to the end of the pieoe there wasn't a dull minute,
George Grossmith was in the vein, he had kicked himself into the
humour of the situation, and though, up till then, Messrs. Temple
and Barrington had scored any amount to G. G.'s duck's-egg, yet
now it was his innings, and he beat them all to nothing, carrying out
his bat, or bis kick, in triumph.
Mr. Barrlngton, who was better made up as a Japanese than
anyone of the company, exoept Mr. Japanese Temple, who was very
droll, and Miss Jessie Bond, plays a part in whioh he represents
several Japanese officials rolled into one. History repeats itself, and
this particular history probably Mr. Gilbert never read or heard of;
but a similar character to that played by Mr. Barrington was
anticipated years ago by Planche in The Sleeping Beauty, when he
wrote Lord Factotum, who thus describes himself:—
"I shall go oraiy. Te who sigh for place,
Behold and profit by my piteous case.
Ak Lord High Chamberlain, I slumber never;
As Lord High Steward, in a stew I'm ever;
As Lord High Constable, I watch all day;
As Lord High Treasurer, I 've the deuce to pay.
As Great Grand Cup-bearer, I'm handled queerly -
As Great Grand Carver, I'm cut up severely.
In other States, the honours are divided.
But here, they 're one and all to me confided."
And, by the way, d propot of "anticipation," in these days of
"irreverence" towards such great works as Junius, which has had
a short and melancholy existence—an irreverence which much
distresses the tender artistic heart of our poor dear sympathetic
friend the Reverend Clemens Duns Scotus— it is indeed sad to find
that the Jingoish insular bombastic sentiment about being;'"an Eng-

ing as his Pinafore and Patience. Of course it is a success.
As to Mazeppa at the Gaiety, the thanks of the Author are due
first and foremost to Miss Farren, who surpasses herself as Catimir,
then to Mr. Terry, specially good in his imitation of M. Damala.
A few superior persons among the Critics, including his Reverence
Clemens Duns Scotus, have animadverted with quite unnecessary
indignation on the adaptation of a certain song just now vastly
popular ahout town, with the idiotic refrain of " What cheer, 'Ria?"
for which is here substituted, " What oheer, 'Zeppa P" Why, since
Burlesque first began, it has availed itself of the musical goods
the gallery gods provided, and its happy use of them became such
a law for this class of entertainment that an audience expected the
introduction of their favourite tunes, and were disappointed if they
didn't get them. The fact is, a Burlesque is intended to parody, ridi-
culously imitate, and extravagantly copy everything it can legiti-
mately lay its hands on, and those Critics must be prejudicially
blinded who fail to peroeive that popular music-hall ditties and
popular music-hall singers are as fairly objects for caricat ure as are
tinpot sentiments in pretentious blank verse, and faulty mannerisms
of the most popular Actors and Actresses. Vive la bagatelle.' And

Sir Henry "Wolff greatly fluttered by little incidents in Glad-
stone's speech, in reply. Several times, in most marked manner,
Prime Minister referred to him as " the Hon. Baronet."
"Not at all," says Sir Henry, when friends press round him to
congratulate him on the significance of this incident. "Nothing in
it, I assure you. Yes, I remember how after Aboukir Napoleon
greeted Colonel Murat as General. But no similarity in eases.
Still I won't say but what I know that Gladstone has his eye upon
me. Just before Dufferin went to Egypt some rather significant
inquiries were made of me, and I am told that when things were
looking very bad with France six months ago a distinguished,person
said 'Ah, if we'd only Wolff in. Paris!' Gladstone and I
sometimes gird at each other in public. But for my own part don't
mind acknowledging that he's a great man. But this about the
Baronet was merely a slip. Nothing in it at all."
Herbert Maxwell, undaunted by ugly tumble last week, comes
back on Bengal Tenancy Bill. The Maharajah been at him again
with a long telegram, which he skilfully throws into series of
questions, and presents at head of J. E. Cross. Particularly pleased
with one question, as to whether native Member of the Council had
or had not moved for a delay of three weeks "to permit the Bill
being published in the Vernaoular Gautee."
"That '11 fetch 'em," said Herbert, serenely surveying himself
in the glass before leaving for the Senate. Don't know what a
Vernaoular Gautee is, but it sounds well."
When question put, Cross, with charming air of innocence,
asked what was the meaning of Vernacular Gautee f This rather a
poser; but Maxwell equal to occasion. "Gautee?" says he, with
a compassionate look at an Under-Secretary so painfully ignorant.
I It's—ah—don't you know—a vernacular dialect of Bengal."
Turned out, after all, that it was really an invention of the tele-
graph-clerk, and should have been written Gazette. General
impression that Maxwell will now leave alone the Bengal Tenancy
BiU. But we shall see.
Gladstone here till long after midnight, waiting to make
statement on Afghan affairs. But the Irish Members talk on, and
Gladstone sits sleepy and gagged.
Business done.—Navy Estimates moved.
Tuesday Night.—" Conservative Party," said Labby, "just now
reminds me of the Army of the Prince of Monaco. The officers are
a trifle disproportionate in number to the rank and file."
Certainly there's no lack of Leaders. Chaplin of course answers
for Domestic Polioy, whilst on Foreign Affairs there's Ashmead
Bartlett, Wolff, Onslow, and Henry the Tyler, in whose inju-
dicious absence to-night, Ashmead scored. But a greater than any
appeared upon the scene to-night. It happened in the Committee
on the Seats Bill. Ritchie moved his Amendment, abolishing two-
membered constituencies. The usual things had been said by Duke
and Northcote. Ritchie, having gravely played his part in the
farce, completed it by proposing to withdraw his Amendment.
The hour was oome, and here was the man, standing in the
corner-seat below the Gangway, sacred to the memory of Newde-
o ate, puffing his cheeks and scorching up with terrible glance the
Radicals below the Gangway, who hailed his appearance with burst
of ironical cheering.
It was Hicks, n<? Simpson, J.P. and D.L. for Co. Cambridge,
(High Sheriff, 1862), and Yiee-Chairman of Quarter Sessions.
Hicks, always terrible to behold in these circumstances, now
literally ablaze with indignation. His gallant bearing recalls to the
memory of the oldest playgoer the once celebrated hero of transpon-
tine melodrama, known as "Brayvo Hicks!" Cross-examined
Chairman as to whether he might subsequently put another Amend-
ment identical [with that of Ritchie's, just discussed. Chairman
rather thought not. "Very well," says Brayvo Hicks, drawing him-
self up, and turning one of his terrible glances upon Radical camp,
"then I shall say a few words now."
Knew that would draw fire—and it did. Roar from the Radicals.
Brayvo Hicks {firm as a rock, drawn up to fullest height: lips
determinedly pursed; cheeks inflated, eyes a-flame with light of
battle; Radicals roar, and cheer,
and laugh. The more they laugh,
the more determined Hicks looked,
and the more he straightened him-
self up, and glared upon them,
the more they laughed. When
noise subsided, Hicks proceeded.
Hotly denounoed compact between
two front Benohes. Always dis-
liked it, he said, and the more he
saw of it, the worse it proved.
"Sir," he cried, in a voioe of
thunder, "I see the liberties of
this House slipping from under our
feet."
Radicals roared again at this
si mile, and at the infuriated manner
in which the orator looked at the
boots of Sir Walter Barttelot,
who was sitting next to him. But
Dilke says Hicks is all right.
"Tories of the old school like the
Bravo," he says, "always, whilst
they oould, kept our liberties under
their feet; and the Bravo, in pro-
phetic vision, sees them now slip-

ping away.

oration, Hicks sat
down, and would not agree to any-
thing. Bellowed " No I" when the
Chairman said " The Ayes have it," and finally sucoeeded in bringing
about Division, in which 44 Conservatives went one way, and the
rest, headed by Stafford Northcote and the Leaders generally,
went the other. Business done.—Much with the Seats Bill.
Wednesday.—Great sensation to-day. Discussing schedules on
Seats Bill. Scotch Members proposing all kinds of rearrangements
of boundaries—omitting bits here, taking bits off there, grouping
and regrouping. Sir Geo. Campbell proposes that Dumfries shall
be united with the Hawick Boroughs. Scotch Members sit fuming
in amazement. "Is the mon daft?" asks Ramsay. "Wby,
Hawick's miles from Dumfries."
When excitement reached dangerous pitch and open revolt
threatened, Sir Geokgk blushingly explains he'd been making a
joke designed to reduce to absurdity arguments of Lord Advocate.
Anger of Scotch Members stronger than ever.
"If Camel'b going to make jokes," says Ramsay, bristling with
rage, "he must give notice in the proper way, and let it appear on
the paper. Then we'll know."
This sort of thing seems infectious.
"Do you know what is the new Munroe Doctrine, Toby?" Camp-
bell-Bannerman asked just now.

Thursday Night.—Getting time Randolph came home from over
the sea. Ashmead Bartlett been making the running lately.

A terrible picture this—Randolph coming home browned with
the Indian sun, and buffeted with Bisoayan breezes, to find his
party reduced to one, with Ashmead Bartlett and Wolff set up
in an Opposition shop!
A oheerful night with the 'tColonels, who deliver over again their
old speeches of these many years past. Hartington pish's and
pshaws on the Treasury Bench, and mutters uncomplimentary
things. But it's all over in good time; gets his vote as easily as
if Army administration were done honestly, with moderate success,
instead of Army being (as everyone knows it is) going to the dogs
with the Navy. Singular absenoe of Irish Members to-night.
Rumours of a meeting, and wild hopes of result similar to that which
attended historical disputation of Kilkenny oats. But, after mid-
night, hopes dispelled. Farnellites troop in, take up their position,
and prepare to make a night of it.
"Not quite used to it yet," says Sheil, yawning. "Breakfast at
eleven o'clock at night comes odd the first week. Luncheon at three
in the morning right enough. Devilled bones, chops, kidneys—look
like supper. But, when it comes to dining at eight o'clock in the
morning, and turning in for the night at high noon, it wants a little
practice to make it comfortable. All very well at the Antipodes:
doesn't do here. Still, it keeps us lively through the night, and
Parnell says it will wear out the Government before Whitsun

Friday.—Lords talking on Opening of Museums on Sunday.
3kam well came out with some honest growling on the subject; the
Bishops visibly shuddered. Duke of Argyll reassured them.
Gave fresh aspect of respectability to Opposition by declaring that
strict observance of Sabbath as now established in Scotland came
over with the Conqueror. "So did I," said Brabournb, thirty-fifth
Baron \ "and shall vote accordingly.
Business done.—Sixty-four for Opening Museums on Sunday,
sixty-four against. "Our Sunday tie," said Lord Granville,
smilingly, readjusting his own cravat.
"The Load-Line Commitikb."—A young Artist thinks that this
must mean the Hanging Committee of the Royal Academicians.
AMONG THE MAGICIANS.
On quitting the room in the Egyptian Hall where M. Mun-
xacsy's grand picture is on view, the sound of strange unmusical
instruments struck our ear, and on interrogating a talkine-head
in a box,—everything is more or less weird in the Egyptian Hall,—
we received the oracular answer that the Egyptian Magicians,
Messrs. Maskelyne and Cooke, were giving their seance in the
room on the right. Nerving ourselves for the effort, we entered
the Cave of Enchantment, and—were enchanted. There, sure
enough, were the great Professors as Fakeers, doing their fake-
ments: a stalwart female form was suspended on nothing in the air,
the Magicians walking right round her the while. Than came the
Cabinet-trick, which was not political, but magical. These "illu-
sions " are introduced in the course of two short thrilling dramas, in
which, as there are no Ladies employed, the men appear as women,
and very oleverly they do it, though we venture to think that the
necessity for men assuming petticoats is not evident. It is explained,
however, by its being a performance of a Maskelyne oharaoter,
Mr. Cooke being a Man-cook, and in his line a cordon bleu.
Then there is a gentleman who gives a sort of entertainment after
the style of Mr. Corney Grain, and who, as far as his little doll
"SaUy " goes, would be as clever a ventriloquist as Lieutenant Cole,
if the latter were not simply perfect. The dark stance is marvellous,
and so let it remain; we don't want to know " how it's done," nor
should we attempt it even if it were all explained to us, and we were
presented with a box of tricks gratis. Messrs. Maskelyne and Cooke,
like many other people, keep a skeleton in a cupboard,—one skeleton
between them,—but they let it out; and when it does oome out, to
see the way it behaves is sufficient reason for shutting it up again as
soon as possible. It is so proud, that it passes most of its time in
tossing its head in the air, as if the audience weren't good enough
for its society! Then it goes mad, and loses his head altogether.
Finally, it behaves like a bankrupt Club,—its members separate, the
head one way, the body another, the arms to the right, and the legB
to the left, and np go the lights—not the skeleton's, but the room's—
and the proprietors bow their acknowledgments in return for well-
deserved applause, while the pianist, who being at it twice a day
every week of his life, probably plays throughout the performance
in his sleep,—unless he is one of Messrs. Maskelyne and Cooke's
automata, which is more than probable,—strikes up gleefully the
National Anthem as a signal for us all to clear out, which we did.
There is another Conjuror set up in opposition to—at all events, he
is on the opposite side of Piccadilly to, M. Vkrbeck. It is a Mr.
Bertram, not of the firm of Bertram and Roberts, though he
might be the Bertram of Boberto II Diatolo, so wonderful are some
of his tricks. When he renounces Magic, he will probably do
penance as a Pilgrim, for which character he is eminently fitted,
being, as we were informed, an exceptionally good Palmer.

"CAB, SIR!"
A Cabman—name at present unknown—in pluckily assisting a
policeman to dispatch a mad Newfoundland dog, who had already
bitten several persons, got bitten on the leg, had to have the wound
cauterised, was disabled in consequence from exercising his usual
vocation—which is not that of slaying mad dogs in the public
interest—and applied for assistance to the Westminster Polioe
Magistrate. He got £1 from the poor-box. Now a disabled Cabman
with a mad-dog bite cannot live very long in the comfort which sick
heroes deserve, on One Pound Sterling. What Mr. Punch wishes to
ask is, whether the public thinks that a man who voluntarily runs
the risk of hydrophobia in its service, merits more than " twenty
shillings from the jpoor-box," and whether, thinking so, it is pre-
pared to back its opinion with its purse. Who answers P
Art Plums and Current Taste.—Mr. Hubert Herkumkr coun-
sels the public'' to avoid acquiring a taste for the Art that is found on
Plum-boxes." Excellent advice. But may not Artists, on their part,
be counselled to abstain from catering for that taste? Why do they P
Because it pays? Perhaps if the Jack Homers of the Art-world
cared less for " Plums," the publio would care less for Plum-box Art.

And here the tale of Beauty and the Beast
Points a new moral. One had need be wary,
As of a Lamia or a Melusine,
Of such a Beast, so crafty and so keen.
Beauty beware! The Beast is good at gloztng,
A pleasant-spoken monster, smooth, insidious;
But, if he oaten a foe disarmed or dozing,
You '11 find him as relentless as perfidious
His mien's suggestive of most modest wooing,
But what he really means is your undoing.

To help the unhappy "viotim of enchantment,'
Sweet innocent, of course it's vastly kind of you,
But oh! so deeply, densely, darkly blind of you!
Enchantment! Well, perhaps a " lying spirit"
Holds Beast in bondage, it looks rather probable;
But if you hope to expel and disensphere it
By showing you are gullible and robbable,
It proves you have not learned the catechism
Of really practicable exorcism.
"Work out the Beast!" exclaims mellifluous Tennyson;
Work out this Beast of falsehood and rapacity,
And, Beauty, you will win a general benison.
But it will call for courage and sagacity.
That done, who knows? The Beast may eschew the past,
And prove the "young and handsome Prince" at last.

MISMANAGEMENT REDUCED TO A SCIENCE!
The proceedings of a Board that has the management of an
Asylum for the reception of Patients suffering from fever, are
scarcely, one would think, of a nature to justify an account of them
being received with laughter; but, after the reading of the Report
of a Committee of Inquiry into the proceedings of the Metropolitan
Asylums Board, we are not surprised at the hilarious reception it
met with from the City Board of Guardians, the laughter being
probably of a bitterly sarcastic character.
In one Hospital, we are told, which had an average of thirty-four
oases last year, the expense of the patients was £942, and of the
Officers, £4761. The entire expense was 15s. per day, or about
£270 per annum per patient. Coals were contracted for at 13s. per
ton, but the price actually paid was 20s. 3d. The Steward had
purchased about a mile of neck-ribbon for the Nurses and female
staff at elevenpence a yard. As a matter of fact, it was worth
about fourpence three-farthings. The consumption of stimulants
was something extraordinary. In one Ward, in which the majority
of the Patients were children, so much wine was charged as having
been consumed, that the Medical Officer deolared it was absolutely
impossible that they could have consumed it, or they must all have
been hopelessly intoxicated!
The Report shows that, according to the Steward's books, 67 bottles
of Burgundy were issued to the patients in this one Ward in the
course of five successive days, ana this is confirmed by the stores'
Porters who convey the wine to the Wards. The Doctor says that
all he ordered in those five days was 16 pints, instead of 67 bottles.
The Committee thereupon remark that they are unanimously of
opinion that the wine was not consumed by the patients, but by whom
it teas consumed is a question which is likely to remain unanswered."
So we should think. Strange to say, the Steward resigned his rather
lucrative appointment during the progress of the investigation.
One of the Committee stated that they were £16,000 short, and
they had no trace where it had gone. Strange to say, the Clerk fol-
lowed the example of the Steward, and hurriedly resigned his
appointment during the progress of the investigation. The cost of
the wine, spirits, beer, and mineral waters consumed by the officers
and workmen in three months was no less than £750. With regard
to the Chairman, the Committee report that he had failed to prove
himself worthy of their confidence; that on several occasions he had
personally obtained authority from, and received cheques for, certain
of the Hospital contractors. Strange to say, the Chairman, like the
Clerk and the Steward, resigned his very honourable and dignified
position during the progress of the investigation.
The Committee, although probably the most merciful and forgiving
that ever sat, find themselves compelled to use such terms as " indis-
cretion," "extravaganoe," "lavish use of stimulants," "no super-
vision, "information suppressed," "ignorance," "indifference to
responsibility," "the wilful reading out of incorrect figures," " abuse
of trust," "irregularities," " culpable neglect of duty, &c, &c, &o.,
till one is lost in astonishment at the possibility of such a state of
things existing in the very midst of us, the shameless and wanton
extravagance of which has to be met by an increased poor-rate upon
those quite sufficiently burdened already. Well, might a member of
the Board of Guardians exclaim: "Charges have been made againBt
Guardians in- times gone by, but no Board in its wildest dreams has
ever done anything equal to this."

he's always regarded with respect in the City of London, why not in

Despair more than I could help upon this occasion. Then there's

unwholesome, while as for Ooldfield, fortunes have been made and
men been broke over them. 1'onans sounds thundering well, by

SOMETHING LIKE AN INITIATION.
A Times Reporter on Wednesday last gave at considerable length
the account of the initiation of Prince Edward of Wales into the
mysteries of Freemasonry.* That
reporter, himself a Mason, re-
vealed the secrets of the Craft,
and has suffered the oonsequenoes
of his rash act. Need it De said
that he was immediately tracked
down by a determined member
of the secret brotherhood, and
taken to—(where we may not
say)—and there in silence broken
only by the action of the steel
implement (which we dare not
describe), the unfortunate victim
of his own fatal indiscretion had
his hair out across from one side
to the other. Notes for another
and fuller account were found
in his pocket, and these, at an
enormous personal risk, and by
the self-devotion of an emissary
who has since fled the country,
we are enabled to place before
our readers:—
Prince Edward of WaleB,
looking very pale, but walking
with a firm step, was led into the
Novitiate-room of the private
and working Lodge of Very
Select Brothers No. A1. Here
he was received by the Lodge-
keeper and some of the younger
Lodgers. The Worshipful Grand
and his Officers were inside the

Prince Edward of Wales. "Aye,
aye, your Worshipful Honour! Avast
cable-tow! Square and compass it is!
Just come aboard, and embarked in
the old Masonic Craft."
Grand Lodge, all wearing diamonds, gold and silver ornaments, and
sitting on golden chairs; "and," said the Times report, "the other
appointments are in keeping." (In whose keeping P A Brother's P
or an Uncle's P The poor man hadn't time to answer. But it speaks
well for the businesslike habits and the punctuality of the Brother-
hood of Lodge A1 that their " appointments" are kept.)
The young Prince was then led to the door, in the costume of the
period, Bed-Time A.D. (i.e.. Ante Diluvium), and demanded entrance
as a Novice in search of the mystic fire of Warmth, the Symbolic
Shovel of Assistance, the Red-hot Poker of Pantomime, the Tongs of
Tribulation, and the Scuttle of Foreign Policy.
The Novice had, according to the rules, been kept without food
since his last meal, and he was now instructed to ask humbly that
some provision might be made for him, without an Act of Parlia-
ment, in the future.
To this the reply from within was returned that "the hungry
should be relieved if he signified what time it was, without speaking
a word."
The Candidate for initiation, therefore, being so instructed by the
Worshipful Past Twelveoclooker, of the M.I.D. Knight Order, rapped
on the wall three times. This was the signification required, and
meant " Knocks," it being then long after sundown.
After this, to prove his courage, the Novice has to drink off a pint
of port, without any inquiry; and, to prove his confidence, he has to
sign his name at the foot of a piece of blank paper.
These first conditions having been complied with, he had further
• A day or two before Prince Edward's initiation, the French Brethren
of the Craft were going in for a very different amusement. The Monde
Maconnique, quoted by the Figaro, announces that, in view of the elections,
"avec le ecrutin de liste, Vinfiuence electoral de la frane-maconnerie est con-
eidirable." "Let hqet" it goes on to say, "sont de> eomitet democraiiques
en permanence." The interest* of our worthy and loyal English Masons are
generally considered to be more in the publican, than the re-publican, line,
and their sympathies with Landlords,—of a certain class. So mote it be.
to prove himself acquainted with the Liberal Arts. This declaration
he made, standing in front of a figure representing the Oreat Caucus.
After this, he was required to disown all knowledge of Conservative
Arts, and then to answer, off-hand and correctly, the test question—
whioh is as old as Masonry itself—" At what time of the twenty-
four hours during which the world goes round the sun is it possible
that a portal, let into solid masonry by a skilled Master of the Craft,
should oease to be a portal P" And the Novice answered, readily
and firmly,—" A portal let into solid masonry by a Master Crafts-
man, would only oease to be a portal when it is a jar."
The news that the young Pnnoe had replied correctly was at once
conveyed to the W. G. M., and was welcomed by three salvoes from
the mortars in the room.
After this, a solemn voice issued from the Throne, ordering the
admission of the Novice on receipt of the pass-word.
The Hodman-Out, instructed by the Tyler, communicated with the
Hodman-In, and the Novice was instructed in the pass-word and
sign. The Hodman-In advancing to him with a drawn trowel,
asked, "Are you hungry?" To which the Candidate, thereto
instructed by the Hodman-Out, replied, "I am."
Then the Hodman-Out opened the door of the Lodge, and said in a
whisper, "Fortnum?"
Whereupon the Hodman-In answered in the same tone, " Mason!"
Then the Novice was admitted.
He was at first dazed by the august spectacle of the W. M., the
Grand Builder, the Past Troweller, the Chief Tyler with a tile off,
the Past Screw-driver, the Worshipful C. Sawyer, the Past Chiseler,
the Grand Glazier, the Worshipful Venetian-Blind-man, the Grand
Par K Floorer, Past Champion of the Lodge A1, the Past Awl-in-Awl,
the Provincial Grand Lad with his Ladder, all with Mortar-boards
on their heads, seated around a Classic Column of Advertisements.
The W. G. M. rose and asked the Neophyte, "What of your own
free will and choice would you elect to be, in preference to all the
honours and dignities that this world can heap upon you, as a small
but not therefore unimportant portion of the Great Masonic Temple P"
And the clear and concise answer came from the Novice's lips, "A
Regular Briok."
The solemn ceremonies of making him into a Regular Brick then
commenced, over which we pass without comment, except to say that
His Royal Highness the W. G. M. of All England performed them
with his usual grace and touching solemnity; and that the young
Prince Edward was duly toasted by all the Brethren, and on being
restored to consciousness, donned the Masonio costume, took the seat
which had been assigned to him in the Lodge, and, bowing to the
elders, sat down upon it with an easy dignity that no less astonished
than charmed his experienced Masonic Brethren.
The last ceremony of all consisted in conferring upon Prince
Edward a Degree in Nautical Masonry. He was taken on board the
Ancient Craft, and had to stand grog all round. Being still hungry,
the Entered Apprentice was now delivered into the oare of the Past
Grand Sand wich-M an, who Willingly undertook to furnish a Re-past
Grand Banquet, of which the Ancient Fraternity subsequently par-
took. After this, the circle was squared, and all went home happily.

ere is good news for oyster-eaters, as authorities agree that next
will witness a very great reduction in the price of the delicious
mollusc."—Standard.
Oh, merry was the Roman to whom his slave-cook spake:
"The Oysters, Sir, have just come in from out the Lucrine Lake."
A luxury in those old days, folks ate them with a will,
But 'twas reserved for our sad times to find them dearer still;
Yet here's good news from fishermen who labour on the deep,
Next season, so our Standard vows, the Oyster will be cheap.
They breed him in the Black water, and eke within the Colne;
They take him to the Kentish beds to fatten there alone;
But when he gets to Billingsgate, before we dine or sup,
The Middlemen get hold of him, and then his price goes up.
But when the season starts again, in Autumn of this year,
He will not be, so experts say, unconscionably dear.
The Oyster's good, as gourmets know, when made into a stew;
He's very nice when scalloped, and when curried toothsome too;
He's good at lunch, at dinner-time, at supper, cold and hot;
He 's good when you are hungry, and he's welcome when you 're not:
A dainty of all Ages, he from others bears the bell,
But wot we that he's best of all when eaten from the shell.
Then welcome this auspicious news! the times are out of joint
When we've to eat the Dutchman and American Blue-point.
Give us our native Whitstable, the epicure's delight,
So fresh and fair, and fat and firm, and delicately white.
Rejoice, 0 Dandos of to-day, who learn it from our rhymes.
The Oyster will be cheap again as in the good old times!

THE AMATEUR CANDIDATE.
By Our Special Reporter.

Special, like a soldier,
july has bis orders. I
have suffered not a little
in the various commis-
sions with which I have
been entrusted. As an
Amateur Maniac, at a
moment when the Public
was furiously interested
—for nearly a week—in
Private Lunatic Asylums,
I have endured hardness,
imprisonment, excessive
shower-baths, and dis-
agreeable company, while 1 so conscientiously worked up the part
with which I was entrusted, that I was released, with the utmost diffi-
culty, from the kind care and select establishment of my Keeper.
As an Amateur Welsher, too (when the Public wanted a view of
Welshing "from within"—that is, from the outside of the Ring),
1 have been chivied, beaten, ducked, and three-quarters killed.
But when you, Mr. Punch, requested me to disguise myself as a
Bed Candidate, and to woo the caresses of the Mob—I mean one of
the Patent New Constituencies—I confess that I almost shrank
from the task. Every man has his soft place, and mine is a disin-
clination to be "mixed up," as they say, with Politios. Amateur
Lunacy, Amateur Welshing, I can stand, hut, as an educated man,
I confess that from Politics I have an instinctive shrinking. How-
ever, professional pride came to my aid, and I undertook to do what
you desired.
My orders were to disguise myself as an Extremist of the most
incredible principles. Some days spent in study of Mr. Hknry
Geobgb, and of the address and rebuke which the Ripon Liberal
Association presented to Mr. Goschen; completed my political edu-
cation. I was next introduced to an intelligent tradesman, a Rat-
catcher, who had great influence with the Extreme Six Hundred of
the Slums and District. My opponent, I should say, in the affeo-
tions of the Constituency was an opulent dealer in Antiquities,
chiefly old clothes—Mr. Ikey Mo. My object, of oourse, was to
overbid this capitalist in my political offers. I got on very well with
the influential Ratcatcher, who was, by descent, a scion of an island
"notable for its verdure and its wrongs." Home Rule,—the sooner
the better,—paid Members for Ireland, the restitution of landed
property to the descendants of its true heirs, evioted under Brian
Boku, were attractive planks in my platform. I had afterwards
to modify some of the planks, and portion out the land to the deni-
zens of the Slums, rent-free; but that was only one of a series of
progressive modifications. Political education, when you are a
Candidate, is exceedingly rapid.
My friendly Ratcatcher, Mr. Bballaghan, then gave the names
and addresses of the Extreme Six Hundred, with whom lay the choice
between Mr. Mo and myself. To my astonishment, I only reoeived
one hundred and thirty names.
"Why, where are the other four hundred and seventyP" I
inquired.
There ain't no more of us nowhere," said Mr. Bkallaohau,
somewhat sullenly. "It ain't quite good enough."
"What is not good enough?
"Why, 8ir, you know it won't go round among so many,—and
times is bad," said my friend and political Mentor.
"I am sorry, Mr. Brallaghait," I replied, "that none of my
Clubs permit members to introduce strangers at luncheon, but may I
have the pleasure of ofierin g you refreshment at a more liberal bar P"
He was a little mollified, and we entered the "Seven Tuns"
I
together. When my hospitality,'had softened the Roman virtue of
this politician, il asked him, onoe more, why there were only one
hundred and thirty men in the famous Six Hundred. But I only
gathered from him that these patriots could not afford to be more
numerous. "It won't run to it. Sir," he added, with a wink.
"Bnt how are you appointed P" I inquired.
"Why, thirty of us met in this ere public, and every oove
brought in a friend, or a brother-in-law or two, and 'ere we is, all
snug and comfortable."
No other explanation was offered, and I set out to win the pro-
mises of the Extreme Association Six Hundred, or rather, "all that
was left of them, left of Six Hundred." These earnest men had the
power of choosing the Extreme Candidate for the whole constituency;
no other need apply; they were, in brief, the Constituency itself, for
an " Oligarch" has a poor chance in the Slums.
Well, Sir, I went about among the Extreme One Hundred and
Thirty. I promised everything I thought attractive: disestablish-
ment of everybody, Home Rule, the Royal Family on board wages,
reduction of the Army; they all said the Navy was reduced enough
already. I proposed to make Professor Fbeeman Vioeroy of India,
and I kept repeating that remark about " unabated loyalty to the
fortunate Statesman, who still so happily controls the destinies of
the Empire,"—what there is of it. I would make Lord Wolseley
withdraw from the Soudan; and if he couldn't withdraw, why, I
would leave him there. These pledges, however, were received with-
out enthusiasm. They had already been swallowed by Mr. Iket
Mo, and the electors appeared but little interested. The Fish-
mongers bade me swear to support Billingsgate. The Greengrocers
urged me to rally round Covent Garden. The Butchers insisted
that it must be made penal to sell Australian meat, except at a re-
duction to the Trade, who could dispose of it as native produce.
All demanded the disestablishment of the Civil Service Stores.
These pledges I took, and I began to have a horrid apprehension
that I might be the chosen of the Extreme Six Hundred, and might
sit for the Slums.
The night approached when the Six Hundred were to meet, and
choose between me and Mr. Mo. I went round to my supporters,
beginning with the Ratcatcher.
You will be there, Mr. Bballaghan," I said. "I rely on you."
"Well, you see, Sir, my 'art is with you, but these is ard times,
and a Plumber, as works with me, has turned down a lot o' rats in an
'ouse in Bedford Square, and I'm to have the job that very night."
"But you won't let profit stand between you and your duty to
your country P"
"Well, Sir, I'm a family man, and chances is scarce,—curious
how rare rats is, just now; 'ard times, Sir. A couple o' pounds, now,
would see me 'armless," and Mr. Bballaghan looked hard at me.
"But that is Bribery and Corruption, Sir," I said, hastily.
Whereupon this leading politician made some remark about
"Stowing my blooming gammon." As he was attended by his bull-
dogs, I hastily withdrew, and looked up my other supporters in the
Six Hundred. It was the same story everywhere. One had to oarry
a banner in the "Britannieroxton," another had a pal's place as a
cab-tout, a third actually told me he "'ad a crib to crack down
Norwood way;" everyone, in short, had some lucrative engagement
which prevented him from being present at the meeting of the
Extreme Six Hundred. My political education had not advanced so
far as they hoped, and I did not " see them 'armless." Next morning
I read, in the papers, that Mr. Mo was the Red Candidate for the
Slums, and the chosen of the Six Hundred.
You will receive, Sir, the bill for my expenses, which, as you will
perceive, were considerable.

cause laughter, and in this the Author of The Magistrate has been,
as it seems to me, thoroughly successful.
Now what are the principal old materials used in The Magistrate f
Let us see:—
The maid falling in love with the young master of the house, and
evidently believing that he will marry her: this is in Betty. In The
Magistrate nothing comes of it: iu Betsy it is of the greatest import-
ance. The oonoeatment of the boy's age from the boy himself also
occurs in Betsy. The wife going with her sister, at night, on an
errand which she wishes to be kept secret from her husband, occurs
in Artful Cards. The stepson taking his stepfather out for a lark
when the latter's wife is out of the way, is similar to the nephew
taking his unole out for a lark in Artful Cards. The Colonel
returned from India, and desirous of visiting his old haunts, reminded
me of the Captain returning from Bengal, and anxious for the same
amusement, in His First Peccadillo, on whioh, or on its French
original with which I am not acquainted, Mr. Boccicault founded
his Forbidden Fruit at the Adelphi. The supping out, after some
fashion or other, is common to Le Reveillon, His First Peccadillo,
and Pink Dominoes, only that in these pieces the female element at
supper is the essential attraction, while in The Magistrate the youth's
idea of a lark is supper with his stepfather and another gentleman
in a private room of a Leicester Square Restaurant; and even the
Colonel from India has no more extensive ideas of "a spree" than to
sup tete-a-tete with a stupid young officer in another private room at
the above-mentioned Restaurant. Not the properest " Young Per-
son" oould objeot to this. All is so very harmless and correct that
the Colonel might
as well have been
an Archbishop; and
as it is certain that
The Private Secre-
tary does depend
for much of its fun
on Mr. Penlty's
clerical costume, so
probably the laugh-
ter at The Magis-
trate would have
been doubled, had
Mr. Clayton ap-
peared as, say, a
Colonial Bishop or
South African
Arohdeacon. But
perhaps Mr. PnnsB.o
has this character
among his reserved
foroes, whioh at
present there is no
necessity to call
out. The entry of
the Police at the
end of Act II. is a situation not entirely unlike the entry of the
Police in Artful Cards, also at the end of Act II., when the
gambling-tables are turned into pianos, and all the characters take

part in a concert; in The Magistrate the delinquents hide under the
table and behind the chairs and sofas. In the Third Act of Artful
Cards Mr. Toole, as Mr. Spicer Romford, enters in a most dilapi-
dated state, and tells how he has escaped from the Police: so does
Mr. Arthur Cecil, as Mr. Posket, in The Magistrate.
Some one said to Frank Talfourd, "I say, that joke of yours
was in your last burlesque."
"My last burlesque!" exolaimed Taleourd, "my dear fellow,
it has been in everyone of my burlesques, and it has always rone
admirably."
Given the ingenious playwright, and then such good old farcical
friends as coming down a chimney with a blackened, face, hiding- in
a jam-closet and re-appearing smeared with some preserve, or being
oonoealed and audibly smashing the crockery,—which is immediately
attributed to the cat,—sitting on bandboxes, leaving a baby in a chest
of drawers, hiding behind a screen, and so forth, will come out again
as fresh as ever. Why pay the original Author of one situation, in
a French piece for permission to introduce it into an English one,
when this wealth of old material is at hand gratis? I confess I am
delighted with the success of Mr. Pinkko's experiment, for we are
returning to the good old days when a farce was called a farce, and
not " a farcical comedy," and there are still lots of " hits of business"
and comic situations which have not been used in The Magistrate,
and, being nobody's property in particular, are only awaiting the
arrival of the bold inventor who can serve them up again with a
new sauce and plenty of it.
So muoh for the material. And now comes the vital question.
"Does The Magistrate make you laugh, or does it not P"
The answer is,—Yes, it does; and, what is more, the _ last
Act is the best, and the fun, which drops a little about the middle
of the Second Aot, becomes funnier and funnier towards the finish.
This is due, first and foremost to Mr. Pinero, and then to Mr. Clay-
ton, who, though occasionally evinoing a self-consciousness of forcing
himself to he comic against his more serious dramatic will, plays his
part, on the whole, in the spirit of true comedy; that is, in real
earnest. He will be still better when the novelty of his appearing
in this sort of part has worn off. On the first night he seemed to
entertain a doubt as to how such old comic business as an inter-
change of hats and hiding under a table or behind a sofa, would go,
and so his execution of these humorous manoeuvres was marked by a
certain shyness and perceptible diffidence, as though, in a difficult
situation, he were doing his best, but was prepared for the worst.
And Mr. Clayton looked so relieved when, after giving his oomic,
shiny, curly-brimmed hat to the Swell who couldn't by any possible
ohanue have mistaken it for his own gibus, the audience roared with
laughter. He knew then that, if they took to this kindly, they
would not turn coldly away from his next great effort in the Third
Aot, when he would have to appear with a black plaster across his
nose, in dishevelled dress and muddy trousers. And he was right;
though he came on shyly
and timidly, quite prepared
to apologise and retire, yet
they cheered him to the
echo, and all was well; for
to come on in this miserable
plight is always bound to
get a laugh: and it always
has, since I knew it when
I was quite a boy.
Mr. Arthub Cecil was
very good, and the part
will improve in his hands.
It is long now since he
appeared in an adaptation
of Le Reveillon; but
somehow, whether it was
the piece, or his character,
or his acting, on the first
night, I was forcibly re-
minded of his first appear-
ance at the Globe.
Mrs. John Wood has
not by any means so pro-
minent a part as fell to her
lot in Young Mrs. Win-
throp. when she had the of our
fun all to herself; here it
is shared by others. She
has to get under a table,
where she is joined by Mr. Arthur Cecil, whom she pinches,
goes "with a roar "—specially from Mr. Cecil.
Miss Marion Terry was simply admirable. She looked the part
and acted it to perfection. Her hunger was catching: her walking
off with the tray in the last Act, inimitable. Let her never play any
more die-away girls or ill-used wives, unless the reason of their d y in g-
away and of their wretchedness is starvation. Mr. Plnkbo has fitted

doesn't matter, it suits Miss Tibet, and Miss Tebby it, perfectly.
To sum up; where the materials oome from, and how they were put
together, are questions that only interest Dramatic Authors and
Critics. But the effect on the public is what concerns the Managers,

I
EXTHAi
CTS FROM THE DIABY OF A CITY WAITEE,

H 1 we are just
about dim-
ming to the
time when the
TeBtymoneyal
Dinners be-
gins, and jolly
good fun me
and Bbown
gits out
^m.
They seems
to manege
matters in the
City so that
amost everybody shood have a Testymoneyall in his turn, and the
speaohes on them ocaahuns is sum think sorumpshus.
The present Cheerman allers tells the late Cheerman that not only
was he the best Cheerman that ever filled a Cheer, but, that the one
only ope of every future Cheerman will be that he may oome within
about 1000 miles of him, and then his hogshead of appyness will be
full to the bung. And when the Testymoneyall is presented, the
Cheerman allers says as it isn't for its meer money valley, for that
ain't much, but for its moral valley, which is anormus, that he opes
he '11 think it worth having. .
Then the late Cheerman is sure to say, for we ears it so off en as we
nose it all by art, that its the proudest moment, &c, his feelins
overoums him, &c, go down to his posteriority, &c, &o.
Sum on 'em seems to make funny selecshuns. I've seen a pre-
sentashun made of a lot of knives and forks and spoons, or a set of
Dish Kovers, and one honnerable Cent chose a sort of little sideboard.
Lor how Bbown and me did grin as we brort it in. I think you can
judge pretty well of a man's oarackter by the Testymoneyall he
sleets, for of course they all sleets 'em, tho' they do try to look quite
surprised when the Sherrymonial takes place. A pompus man now
would have a great big French Clock all smeared over with sham
sold. A shabby man would have useful domestick artikles, like
forks and spoons, or a Warming Pan, a punoshal man would have a
* 'g watch, that they calls I think a Barommeter, a tasty Cent would
ive a Picter or a Statty, while a Spoony wood naterally have a
\ Pot and setterer.
What rum things sum on 'em gets 'em for! Sum because they 're
fpreshus old, as if they could help it, and wouldn't be young if
they could. Sum because they've bin such a jolly long time a doin
of nothink in pertiokler. Sum because it's allers bin the custom.
and sum, because sumboddy propoges it in hopes his turn will
sum next.
Bbown says the writing on 'em is allers exaoly alike, so when
they cums to be sold, the Porn Broker only has to take out the name,
and then they does for sumboddy els*! but Bbown will allers say
such soreoaustio things, Bbown will. I remember when one of my
Patrons had a Pianny Forty guv him, Bbown whispered to me, they 'd
have given him a Trumpit only he's got one of his own that he's
allers blowing.
I remembers onoe a little T. Pot was guv to sumboddy because he
had bin a Churchwarden and hadn't robbed anybody, or sumthink of
that sort, and sumboddy told him it was the custom to ask 'em all to
drink Shampayne with him, and, just for a lark, they drank such a
lot that the Dill oome to double the price of the T. Pot, and he was
as savage as a Bare, and woodn't pay the bill for a long time.
Sum times we has sum werry funny incidents occurs. For instance,
the other day it took me and Bbown a matter of 5 minnita to put all
the Testymoneyall on the table. There was a matter of 7 or 8
diffrent things I A booty ful large Clock, and Yarses, and Marbly
Osses, and lovely ornyments of differing kinds, as must have cost
beeps of money. And a Cent as I was standing behind says to his
nayber, "Why Jones, my boy," says he, " that's about the best £20
worth as ever I seed."
"£20 worth," says the other, "why I'm bound it never oost less
than £1001"
"Well," says the other, "but I happen to know there was only
19 guineas subskribed, for 1 saw the list. How the jeuce is it done?
1 Why," says the other, "he pays the difference hisself 1"
"Then how can they engTave upon it all, 'Prisented by So-and-So
toSo-and-So'?"
"Why," says he, "it's as easy as Lying 1"
I was called away, and so herd no more. But oh, my Masters,
what a Riverlashum! How proud a man must feel of a Testymone-
yall for which he has paid about fifteen shillings in the pound out of
his own pocket! and now proud he must feel when his wife and his
famerly and his frends reads the lying inskripshun! I wunder how
long it is before the Wife of his Buzzom finds him out, and respecs
him acordenly. Why I should be ashamed of sitoh a thing, tho' 1
am only a pore Waiter. To put a case, which Bbown says, with his
ushal imperanoe, may praps be taken for a Nint. Suppose as the
Cents as patronizes the onrered Albion was to prisent me with
i a duzzen reel silver Tea Spoons, as a mark of Kespeck, shood I be
justerfide in making'em into Tables f
No 1 Truth says No 1 Honner says No! As the Cent says in the
Play, "Sham, sham, where is thy Blush P"
But, torkin of blushin, a sumthink ocourd last Janniwerry witch
I aven't ad the face, no, not evin that part on it as is cald " the
cheek," to menshun before this—but now I can. I was ofishyatin
at the horsepitable Manshun House wen his horsepitable Lordship,
the Lord Mark, hentertained all the hole Corporashun at one blow—
no, not one blow out, as Bbown wulgarly nobserved. If Bbown
would jest take egsample from sum one else who shall be nameless,
it would praps be better for Bbown.
Well, one of our reglar old Deppertys was there, as usual, and he
covered his manly buzzom with a table napkin, as usual, and I guv
him his plate of thick turtel, as usual, and then waited tranquilly
as usual, Knowing as he wood want a second help, as usual. Well

setting next to him was a ewident stranger, and after he had took
jest a spoonful or two of his soop, he said a sumthink to the Dep
perty as I didn't quite catch, and then waited for a anser, but there
wasn't no anser. He then tried again wen the fish cum, but there
wasn't no anser, nor no notice. I seed him try no less than five
times, but all in wane, no anser and no notice. Judging from his
estonished hair, I makes no dout as he thort the Depperty was def

"Sir, you are ewidently unaccustomed to this style of thing, so
I will give you jest one word of adwioe. Wen you are inwitea to
sitoh a Bank wet as this, Eat your Dinner and don't Talk!" And
he got up and went away.
Well, after the speaohes was all finished, the gentlemen all
marched into the Lobby to git sum Tea, the Lord Mare and that
sellebrated and honest whist-player, Sir Lion Plateajb, at their
heads, wen in came the two brightest-looking Ladies in all London,
namely the Lady Maress and the Sherryfess, aceompaned by their
atendent Sprites, as they sez in the story-books, and if they didn't
lite up all the place jest like the rising sun coming out of a cloud of
blaok coats, my name isn't Robert. And now cums the ewent that

wen the werry larst gest was a taking of his lingering departure,

i was that took with supprise as I thort I shood adropt. _ How-

thanks to the kyind oondycension of one of the most grashus

PORTRAIT OF A BANK CLERK ENJOYING
A BANK HOLIDAY.
Dedicated to Sis John Lubbock.
The Country crammed—the Sea-side jammed—
The Trains a crush—the River a rush—
Oh, is it not a jolly day?
The Shops all shut—the Streets all smut—
No room iu the Park for the poor Bank Clerk!
Not a Bank, but a Blank Holiday!
« SAFE AS A BANK."
As in the face of the grave complications that appear to be looming
in the immediate future, some doubts have been expressed as to the
nature and scope of the regulations for the proper safety and pro-
tection of the Suez Canal about to be proposed at the forthcoming
Paris Congress, the following brief synopsis of some of the principal
provisions of the Scheme will be read with interest. It is under
stood that in time of war—
(1.) A merchant or passenger vessel that, having once entered the
Canal, has been somehow blown up by mistake for a belligerent, oan
not recover its entrance fee in the local Egyptian County Court,
unless accompanied by an International Solicitor and a battery or
two of Horse Artillery.
(2.) Hostile Ironclads wishing to hire the Canal for the whole or a
portion of the afternoon for the purpose of holding an engagement,
must give notice to the Secretary, and enter their names in the
Company's Fighting books kept lor the purpose, not later than nine
o'clock the same morning.
(3.) Passengers either goinfj to or returning from India, and arriving
at either end in the dark during the progress of a general action of
not less than three hostile fleets on the waters of the Canal, at the
same time, will have the privilege of walking along the banks, and,
if they should desire it, of watching the progress of the devastation, as
well as they can, on payment of a small extra fee for " gate money."
(4.) The right of Torpedo-planting for experimental purposes will
be allowed, under oertain restrictions, to all the leading Representa-
tives of the International Commission; but, in the event of the
practice causing any serious annoyance to unsuspecting Merchant-
men in trantitu, the Power at fault will be expected to make a
suitable donation to the Pilot in charge, or, if there is nothing what-
ever left of him, to his duly appointed Exeoutors.
(5.) This condonation will not be either required or exacted in the
case of Turkish bottoms, that, by Article XIX. of the proposed pro-
visions, may be " blown out, as occasion may render necessary, freely,
and with perfect impunity.
There are a few other provisions dealing with the Shareholders'
rights and liabilities in the not improbable event of the whole Canal,
from end to end, having, as a precautionary military measure, to be
entirely destroyed—hut they are comparatively unimportant. It
may, however, be gathered from the above extracts, that the Com-
mission not only mean to exercise their functions in a wide and
liberal spirit, but evidently well know what they are about.
A REAL MUSIC-HALL.
Philharmonic Concert at St. James's Hall. Thursday, March 26.
Sir Arthur in the Chair. Herr Joachim at the Violin. Signor
Bottesini at the Contrabasso. First night of new Serenade,
written for this occasion by Mr. Thomas Wtngham, and person-
ally conducted by the Composer.
It is quite a treat'
When in "Arthur's seat"
Sits Sullivan, classical,
Nothing here farcical,
Which seems for him funny,
Guiding a symphony
Written by Schumann,
Always so human.
Musio hath charms,
Not this by Brahms ; *
Joachim plays it,
So all must praise it.
Musio to brine 'em,
Written by Wikqham.
New Serenade,
First time 'twas played.
Was it? Oh, yes,
Thorough success;
Plenty of toon,
Oboe, bassoon.
Wonderful things
For flutes, horns and strings,
And there are some
Bangs on the drum,
(Sweet "Serenade"
To waken a maid!)
Then in E Flat
Finish with that,
Played by the fellows
With violoncellos,
And 'mid braro*
It comes to a olose—
'' Short pedal tonio "—
At Philharmonic
Winoham dows thrice,
All very nice.
Then Bottesini
Comes up quite "beany,"
Wonderful fellar!
Plays Tarantella,
Takes an enoore,
Flays it once more.
Nod to Sir Arthur,
Suffering marthyr,
Up in his seat:
We 're on our feet.
"Good-bye," laconic,
To Philharmonic
* Concerto in D for violin with Orchestra Op. 77. 'Arry says, "' Hop
77!' My! what a lot o' dance-music he's written!"
BRILLIANT EGG-SAMPLES.
Christmas Cards are not so much the vogue as they were two
years ago, Valentines
have almost vanished,
and Twelfth Day has
quite lost its oharaoter,
or characters, but, in-
stead, the Easter Egg is
increasing year by year,
and growing to an
enormous size. A little
Boy, after a visit to Mr.
Cremer's, can teach his
Grandmother the prover-
hial lesson with an egg.
But what she may find
will considerably surprise
her. The inventions are
ineggshanstible. The
designs for the artistic
productions of Messrs.
Sparaqnapane's (or
Spare - no - pains) Hens
have been thoroughly
eggscogitated. True, in
both cases—and in any
amount of cases — the
Eggs are only "Shop Eggs;" but, with just here and there an
exception, they are all quite fresh, and, where they are not abso-
lutely new-laid, there is not an instance of one being bad.
The Noble Four.
War never saw midst battle shocks,
Two braver men than Cole and Cox;
Each Englishman of manly soul
Tosses his oap for Cox and Cole,
Ditto for Garner and for Snell.
(We 're glad to know them stout and well).
Punch drinks their health, and bids them know
That England's heart is all aglow
(Far, far beyond St. Stephen^ lobbies)
With sympathy for four brave " Bobbies!"
Mrs. Ramsbotham says, she considers suoh a man as O'Donotan
Rossa, the Dynamiter of a Vicious Circle.
The Athenaum speaks of Junius as "this ill-starred play."
Severe this on the Star.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE
DIARY OF TOBY. M.P.
Huuse of Common*, Monday Night, March 23.—" Yon might hive knocked me down with a
feather," Ashmead Bartlett stid when describing what happened at Eight o'Clook.
Member for Eye strolling1 into House to see if tie'd dropped any Questions on the floor. House
nearly empty, there being nothing more attractive than business going on. Seats Bill under discus-
sion. Looked across the House, and there below the Gangway, in the corner-seat behind Dillwtn,
sat the Prime Minister!
"It's oome at last I" Asbmead gasped. "Six years ago, a young man, with an eyeglass, stood
outside Palace Yard with sixpence in his pocket, and saw Gladstone go by. He said to himself,
'I will live to drive him out of office.' That young man was me, and 1 have done it. I thought 1
would send him in ordinary course to Front Bench opposite. But it seems he's so badly beaten
that he throws up all hope of returning to power again, and has gone and joined the malecontents
below the Gangway. Becomes a corner-man like Forster and Goscekn. My time is at hand, and
I shall not forget friends. Wolff shall certainly have either Berlin or Constantinople. Will go off
and put down a Question on the suhjeot for to-morrow."
Asbmead as usual got the wrong rat by the tail. Premier only gone to sit below Gangway in
order to discuss with Richard Grosvenor probabilities of Division on Egyptian Convention. Still,
it was odd and suggestive to see bim there, with Dilek on Treasury Benoh acting as leader of House.
"What a time we should have, to be sure!" said Dillwtn, "supposing W. E. G. really
became a corner-man. How he 'd make both sides sit up! For such a prospect I would give him
up my seat."
Stafford North cote moved Adjournment of House, in order to discuss arrangements for
debating Egyptian Convention.
"Don't feel quite sure, Tobt," said Sir Stafford, thrusting his hands up his sleeve, "that I've
done quite the right thing. They bothered me so about action on the Seats Bill, and soowl at
me because I won't badger Gladstone every night on Afghan business, that 1 felt I must do
something. But seem to have moved at the wrong time. We've had Asbmead Bartlett and
O'Donnell discussing my Motion, and now we've got down to W. Redmond. I think if the
House will permit me, I'll withdraw it. Which he did, and business commenced.
Business done.—Progress with Seats Bill.
Tuesday.—Henrt the Tyler nowhere in the race at question time. Onslow pretty well in,
and Wolff a good third. But Asbmead Bartlett still Eclipse. Got a little tumble from the
Speaker to-night s put question to Haktington and received answer. Rose immediately, and put
same question in slightly altered form. This too much for illimitable patience of Speaker. "The
Hon. Member," he said sternly, "asks the noble Lord to answer a question he has just replied to."
Ashmead up again. Would like to argue this matter with the Speaker but the Right Hon.
Gentleman not noticing him, ejaculates " Mr. Cropper!" Cropper comes up, puts matter-of-fact
question about some Bill to be introduced in Lords, and Asbmead Bartlett
"You came a Cropper there, old
boy," said Wolff, in sympathetic
tones.
"Do you think so? Well, I don't
see it in that light. Rather think
I scored. If Speaker hadn't inter-
posed, Hartikgton would either have
answered the question or declined, and
there an end on't. But Speaker comes
in, calls special attention to me, and
in country Clubs they '11 rattle their

Bartlett at 'em again. Gets Har-
tinqton in a corner. Speaker

"1 'm glad of that," said Wolff,
in fine sarcastic tones. Doesn't alto-
gether like the airs Asbmead gives

Dilkb smiling with increased serenity
as bad quarters of hour succeed each

division taken, Parnellites left to
themselves to vote for Motion.

Wednesday.— Grinding away at
the Seats Bill. Made fair progress
up to Four o'Clook, when Windbag
Sexton having, in the interval, been
freshly inflated, re-appeared, and
raised again question of representa-
tion of Dublin, which had occupied
Committee for three hours on previous
night; now appropriated remainder
of the sitting; promises to oome up
fresh again after Easter recess.
Speaker of Purfleet House of Com-
mons in Distinguished Strangers'
Gallery. Honoured Mr. Peel by
sending for him, whilst Sexton
windbagging.
"Thought you had this question
talked to death in Committee
yesterday f" said the Purfleet Per-
sonage. "How is it possible that it
can come on again to-day, blocking
publio business? Is it in order?"
"Quite," said our Speaker,
meekly. "Am not sure whether
ingenuity of Irish Members may not
find another opportunity of rede-
livering their Speeches even in
Committee. Certainly they '11 do so
on Report."
"And yet," said the P. P.,
sternly regarding the trembling
Speaker, "you call yourselves a
business assembly, and have oharge
of Imperial interests. Come down
to Purfleet, and see how we manage
things there."
"Thank yon—I will," said the
Speaker, getting back just in time
to resume the Chair, and run through
Orders of the Day.

A CHESS DIVAN IN THE STRAND.
Thureday.—Just after prayers met Habcoubt in Corridor, smiling
softly to himself; evidently beaming with some fresh delight.
"Been snubbing somebody?" I asked, pleasantly, carious to
know why he should look to glad he was alive.
"No, Tour, quite the contrary. 1 've been doing the heavy father
business with the gallant Policemen who grappled with the
dynamite in the crypt the other week. Quite a theatrical business.
I stood myself where the other explosive had been placed. Glad-
stone, the Speaker, Mrs. Gladstone, Rosebert, and an admiring
company grouped around. Wanted the Archbishop of Castkhbcry
to come. But he was engaged. Cox and Cole brought up to slow
music. Got Garner and Snell, thot by Shoreditch burglars, to
appear. Wanted Chamberlain, P.C., shot at Islington; but Doctors
wouldn't let him ome. Always meddling, those Doctors. When
everything ready, Curtain drew up, me discovered standing between
the gallant Policemen with a hand on shoulder of each. Made 'em a
fine speech ; solemnly shook hands with them. Then pinned Albert
Medal on Cole's breast, reminding everyone, 1 'm sure, of Napoleon
the First decorating eoldier on the field of battle. Shook hands
with Sergeants again, made them another little speech. Shook hands
with 'em once more. They like it. Made speech to Police genf rally,
and crowd; shook hands with Inspector Gernon ; would have thaken
hands all round, but time pressing. You should have heard them
give three cheers for Home Secretary. Egad, Toby! when I
They:
of himself, and suffuse his mind with a genial glow,

Shake
I was much affected. I watched the Majestic Figure as it moved
down the corridor. As it passed the Policeman stationed at corner, it
stopped and shook hands with him.
House of Commons engaged on fresh Vote of Censure. Glad-
stone moves Resolution approving Egyptian Convention. Bkuce
moves rejection. Having heard both speeches, Members go away to
think them over, leaving House empty for rest of night.
Speech of the evening made bv Acxebs, new Member for West
Gloucestershire. Delightful for its ponderous simplicity, and its
unaffected belief that West Gloucester is the Premier Constituency
of the country, for whose decision at recent election Europe held its
breath.
_" I fancy," said Fabrer Her* cbell, "we've gained a great Acker-
tition in the Member for West Gloucestershire.
Business dune.—Egyptian Convention submitted.
Saturday, 2 a.m.—Division just taken place on Convention. Might
have come off hour ago only for Childers. Got up at One o'Cleck
to "sav few word*." Wasn't finally howled down till quarter to

"Bat the vanity of spetohmaking too much for him."

PROBABLE FUTURE OF THE WORKING-CLASSES.
{Not a Chapter from Mr. Mill's "Political Economy.")
So the premium required from a candidate for the coveted post of
Dock Labourer has been raised to a fourth part of his daily wages!
I learn that the agents who arrived in the East-End with the object
of taking advantage of the depressed condition of labour by pur-
chasing a few thousand English families for the Central African

What consolation it must inspire into the breasts of the workless,
to know that the remedy which chiefly oommended itself to the im-

Possibly some of the out-of-workers in Southwark, "who were
presented with a packet of tobacco apiece as they left the room, at
which they seemed much pleased," would have been even more
grateful for tickets for themselves and families to New South Wales,
and a promise of employment when they got there.
In the midst of all this poverty, it is at all events satisfactory tc
know that the School-Board rate still stands at two-and-sixpenoe in

Bnt the war-chronicler's barbario babble,

No thrice-worn them* in thine heroic mind,
Which honours moved not, nor the mouth of praise,
Nor any noise of general acclaim.
Then with what voice shall the loud herald, Fame,
Speak^forth thy signal splendour, with what bays
Thy brows assume to frame?
Not the mere warrior's blood-bedabbled laurel,
Though never knight borne homeward on his shield
Hath greener reaped from any stricken field;
Bat as fame's bauble and as childhood's coral
Lightly thou wouldst have held the trivial leaf.
He who to his own breast the steely sheaf
Of spear-points gathered, and so gladly died
To break the foe,* had something of thine heart,
Who, lonely 'midst large hosts, couldst play thy part
Steadfastly sacrificial; gentle-eyed
Confronting death's swift dart.
Faith-fired to fearless firmness such as only
Faith may inspire, emancipate from self.
High above pride as the low spell of pelf,
How enviable, 0 loyal heart and lonely,
Thy radiant isolation, like a star

How narrower seem the heavens, and less bright,
Since thou from our eipeotant gaze art gone,
Leaving us with the night!

Opulent yet in many a noble name.
With lustre brighter than mere statecraft's fame,
More radiant than the warrior's glittering glory.
Suoh lesser lights eclipse them in the fine
Sun-glow of selfless valour such as thine,
Soldier whose sword, like Galahad's, was not used
To hew out honour, but to champion right;
Plan-Bhaper who, in council as in fight,
Wast endlesslv resourceful, yet refused,
Death-snartd, an easy flight!
We picture Ihee, with hearts that thrill yet sicken,
One in the waste, alone against a host,
Like that Pompeiau sentinel at his post.
Firm, whilst a hundred perils round thee thnken
Hourlv. and hourly fades the hope of aid
From England. Throuiih the Desert night's dusk shade
We watch thee send that vigilant gaze in vain
Across the silent sand-flats mile on mile;
To death resigned, unwitting that the while
Thy brave belated brethren toil and strain
Toward thee o'er the Nile.
We chafe, we grieve with unavailing sorrow,
That treachery's stroke was swifter than our stride,
That trapped, betrayed, our trusting hero died
Unreached by rescuing hands, which on the morrow
ft Triumphantly had grasped his own and spread
Between him and the traitor. Gordon dead!
Belief shrinks back as from some black sheer verge,
■ And hope, long failing, but late quickening
To a new life, like blossoms in the spring,
One last faint wistful plea is fain to urge
For keeping still a-wing.
Dead? Nay, not so 1 The enduring inspiration
Of suoh a spirit sways beyond all death,
A quickening presence, an abiding breath.
It lives through all the being of the Nation,
And far beyond the foam, like a quick flame,
Leaps to the hearts of all who bear our name,
Though under other stars; so that throuiih thee
Kinship more promptly speaks, more proudly thrills
Into one phalanx ot heroio wills
Men of thy blood, wide-sundered thnneh they be
By seas and wastes and hills.

TAKING WARNING.
William. "Treating him like that, pimply because he's
had an Accident with the China! Wht, if mt Master
HAD AS BAD A TEMPER AS HIS Mil
THIS SORT OF THING SO MUCH BETTER IN ENGLAND!'
LOOK ABROAD!
If there were any reasonable hope of being able, even for a
moment, to get our lively but self-satisfied neighbours across
the Channel just to see themselves as others see them, it might be
worth while to adapt and parody for their benefit the ridiculous and
oontemptible scene, worthier a good deal of an ill-managed Ape House
than of a deoent Legislative Assembly, enaoted last week in their
Lower Chamber on the announcement of the recent Tonkin disaster.
But a people eaten to the very bone with a diseased and despicable
vanity learns nothing, and it would be as useless to ask a frantic and
gibbering Parisian what he would have to say if our own House of
Commons were suddenly to sink in some trying crisis to the level
reached the other day by his own National Assembly, as to expeot
him to appreciate the Parliamentary self-control and the generous
attitude towards political opponents that have, with rare exceptions,
hitherto invested Party warfare in this oountry with a dignified
respeotability with whioh it could ill-afford to dispense. The very
history of the last few weeks furnishes ample and striking testimony
to the existence of this commendable national restraint.
On the evening that it beoame known in London that Khartoum
had fallen, and that General Gordon was captured, no one will deny
that in the first sharp moment of universal outcry, with the whole
oountry thunderstruck and dnmfounded at the news, Mr. Glad-
stone had a far graver issue to deal with than that whioh M. Fekhy
encountered in the temporary reverse of the Frenoh troops telegraphed
from Tonkin. Yet the Speaker, in the interests of order, had not,
amidst a surging uproar of gesticulation, either to dash his own wig
or dance on his own chair.
Nor were the Members on the Front Opposition Bench so very
badly behaved. Sir Stafford Northcote did not. more GalHeo,

tests the patienoe of the oountry, ought to be met in a Constitu-

ALL ROUND THE STUDIOS.
{From Our Special on "Show Sunday.")
As usual we sent Oar Private and Very Special All-Rounder to
visit the Studios on Show Sunday. The next morning we received
the following note :—
Dear Ed.,—Merely writing" 'Ed." reminds me, if I wanted remind-
ing, that I have such an 'ead, myself, this morning! It is one of my
bad days: E ist winds,
I think: ean't make it
out. I went all round
the Studios yesterday,
from morn till dewy
eve, and at last t he-
Studios went all round
me. Many of the
Artists were old friends
of mine, some were
ancient playmates, the
majority were total
strangers, but the same
spiritof true hospitality
and good - fellowship
actuated everyone alike,
and all of them, from
the President down to
the paint-pot boy, were
delighted to see me.
The oannikin clinked
in every Studio. We
drank to old times, to
preseut times, to future
glories; we toasted
you. Sir, as the Edi*or,
and we drink to our
next merry meeiinif,
or meetings, as on my
Notes I find that I am
engaged tor a series of
artistic dinner-parties, many of them actually on the same day
and at the same hour, and a lot of the dear merry Swiss Cottage
Boys are ooming to me, but somehow the dates,—my Notes were
made in the gloaming,—have got mixed, and 1 shall have to go all
round again next Sunday, to find out when I dine with everybody,
and when anybody dines with me.
As you are in a pressing hurry, I must send you my Notes just as
they are. I have every faith in your dear clever printers, but,
above all, in yuur able and astute Editorship, and no duubt, between
you all, you will be able to "lift the sand from the wheat"—(or
whatever the darned proverb is—I was never good at proverbs)—and
present a dear account of my Grand Rounds to your readers. "Pass
Grand Rounds and all's well,"—at least all will be well when 1 've
stai v d for a day, and slept for a night, and seen nobody, and done
nothing.—Tours evtr.
We set his Report verbatim before our readers, and they will then
perceive for themselves why we should have every sort of confidence
in him on a future occasion. The Notes are in pencil, and become
more and more illegible as they proceed. The first ones are not very
clear, as the writer has evidently written his latest remarks over his
earliest. We give the result as best we can:—
Sunny morning. ColdUh. Dry. Warm walking. Nipping, and
an eager air. Called at Sir Frederick's. He is very busy. Capital
sherry and biscuits. Sorry he couldn't see me. Will I call again
in an hour. Yes. Much warmer. Where next P Try Armitage.
Knew Armitage when he was a boy. Excellent chap—first-rate
dry sherry—and biscuits. Better than the President's that is, fur
my own taste. Asked Abmt where he gut it. Do I think he stole
it, he Bays. Apologise. More sherry. Early, Sunday morniDg.
Not used to this sort of thing since we were boys together. Old
Army says, will I go now, as he's busy painting something for St.
Paul's Cathedral, and he has lots of people he must attend to. I say
oertainly—yes, by all means. What day will suit him to oome and
foregather P Foregathering Day settled. When? Quite forgot to ask.
Door shut. Will go back, and ask when. No, will call back—no, will
call on my way back to ask when. Quite forgot to see old Army's
pictures. Must look in again. Where to now P Hi! Cab! Rather
sleepy. Effect, I think, of getting up so early, or else it'« the smell
of the paint in the Studios. Cabman, drive to Millais'. He doesn't
know where Millais' is. I say, Red House—round corner. Big
place—steps up inside—lots of carriages (I nearly said Asparagus,
instead of carriages—I am so sleepy) at door. That's Millais'
house. Arrive suddenly. Keep cab. Door open. People going in,
and coming out. Staircase very beautiful, out slippery. Feel a
little faint. It's the heat. Art-Butler wants me to have some
soda-water. Sherry and bisouit. Water bisouits P No; oil-cake,
out of compliment to Art. Take a hair of the biscuit that bit me.
Millais' painting long subjeot,—The Orni—The Ornitholollogist.
Intended as a decoration for St. Paul's Cathedral. Burial of a Tolde-
rolologist,—it sounds like a comic chorus. Millais has some good
sherry, too—not so good as President's, and not up to old Army's. Must
go back and see old Army. Oil-oake biscuits better at Millais'.
Took cab again to see Kuan k Holl. Quite a little Holliday. No
sherry here. Port. Dry. So am I. And a sandwich. Knew
Holl since he was quite a child. He is painting Lord Dcfff.kin as
Hamlet. Very gool likeness. Too much port in it. No thank you,
1 don't smoke with port before one o'clock in the day. Must go on
now. Shan't sleep here,—though really if it wasn't for duty, which
urges me on, I should like snooze. Hi! Cab! Frith's. Don't know
whrre Frith's is ?■ And eail-you»«4f-a-oabmaft1- Hnusa, with flag-
fiying to indicate luncheon time. Yes—that's Frith's. Just sitting
down to shoulder of mutton and potatoes. Wouldn't disturb him
for world —will see pictures after lunch. I never take lunch—
never. Won't I break through rule? Yes, I will, as I am breaking
through rules to-day. Show Sunday. I'm so warm now I call it
"Tret Show Sunday." Roars of laughter. Frith good Frenoh
scholar, sees joke with half an eye. Likes the merry jest which
cheers but doesn't inebriate. I cheer, but don't inebriate. Bitter
Beer or Champagne P Well—both so good—and I never lunch—
that—beer safer to begin with, and champagne after, if my host takes
it. Hope he '11 make himself quite at home. If he likes to paint
during luncheon time it won't disturb me. Will I have cigar and
whiskey and water? Well—let's ste—it's getting late—just two—
but it's Show Sunday—and if I start again at 2 30 I might show
myself in the Park, and then show myself at church on way back.
Back where P Millais' or President's. Said I'd call somewhere.
Got it on my Notes. Cin't find it. What's Frith painting? Oh
—I see—yes—"John Knox and the Pope." Capital subject.
Intended fur decoration of St. Paul's Cathtdral. Did he do it all
this morning t Must be off now. Got to go somewhere else—say
BoroHruM's. because it begins with " B." Hi! Cab!
Curious change in weather. Misty. Some difficulty in seeing
Notes. Oughtn't to have taken that heavy luncheon. Must walk it
off—that is, when I get out of oab. Bougbton at home. Surry I
can't go all the way up-stairs. Will he bring his pictures down, and
hang 'em in the hall for me to 'speot? If he won't, it's hit loss, not
mine. Sherry P No. Well, then, as it's after 1 unch-time—he's so
hospiterable—this I put down on Notes—a liqueur is the very thing.
It corrects everything. All right. And a mild cigar. Well,

QUITE THE WRONG MAN.
[Our Own Condensed Shilling Dreadful.)
Chapter, I.—The Novelist's Resolvb.
William Van Donop O'Dwter, Poet and Novelist, of Hiberno-
Batavian descent, had been the pride of New York fiotion.
"America for
the Americans,"
was one of his
mottoes in the
conduct of his
Art, others were,
"None but
native impres-
sions," "No
international
complications,"
"Incidents are
vulgar." It was
O'DwrER'sboast
that there was
never an Euro-
pean character
in all his tales,
that he had
never visited
Europe, and had
never seen a
Prince, even in
a photograph.
Yet he plumed
himself, and
correctly, on
speaking Eng-
lish without a
trace of Transatlantic accent. Altogether he was a very remarkable
man and Novelist.
The pnblio is fickle. O'Dwter's productions, so patriotioally
exclusive, ceased to be praised. Readers asked for something more
varied, cosmopolitan, and exofting.
Behold O'Dwter as the argent rays of his reading-lamp etch out
the lines of his thin, dark, studious face, and are absorbed by the
violet velvet coverings of his costly furniture.
A pile of Reviews of his last patriotio novels, all unfavourable, lie
around him.
O'Dwter arose from his luxurious couch.
"These scribblers shall have what they want," he cried. "They
shall have Europe, they shall have Dukes, nay, they shall have
Princes, they shall nave dynamite and disguises.
Having uttered this vow, the heroic Novelist drew from his breast
a small golden cahier with golden edges, and a patent key. In this
he jotted down some of the ideas for an European Romance of the
day, just as they thronged into his inspired imagination.
Next he called his valet, bade him pack his valises, and in an hour
O'Dwter was moving Eastward Ho, ready for the invasion of
London, for the conquest of new fields of Art.
Chapter II.—In Pall Mall.
'Twas half-past six o'clook. 'Twas evening in Pall Mall and in
the Season. The late yellow light, flooding down that avenue of
Ealaoes, lit up the keen features of O'Dwter, who had just reached
is base of operations. A Lady of great loveliness bowed to him
profoundly from her elegant equipage, as Bhe was whirled past by
two brilliant bays. O'Dwter's hat was at once in his hand.
"How unlike what I have always believed of England!" he said.
"I have taken the British for a cold race, uninterested in literary-
merit, especially when foreign. Yet here"
O'Dwter touched his hat in what he conceived to be the fashion
of a military salute.
The tall Guardsman on duty at Blenheim House had just presented
arms to him as he went by.
"Extraordinary!" he muttered. "The most bewitching and
high-toned Ladies in the land,—though nobody," he added, recol-
lecting bimselfj " would look round at them if they passed on Broad-
way,—are bowing to me, all the time, out of all the carriages. Every
hat off wherever I go! The very Soldier on the stoop of that red-
brick house saluting I My Novels, especially my Rose of Neicport,
"HONOURABLE INTENTIONS."
Parient Shaw-Lefetre (to General Public). "Oh yes, you must pay
your addresses in due form to Miss Telegraphina."
must be better appreciated in England than I had supposed."
O'Dwter left a card for a friend at the Blenheim Club,
As he
out into the street, he nearly jostled a very well-dressed man,
with a gardenia in his button-hole, who bowed, and apologised
elaborately.
"Certainly a courteous people," said O'Dwyeb. The evening was
falling. He took a Hansom and drove to his hotel, the "Shortham."

In the faith that in all Ireland none would work her scathe or wrong,
Though she paoed from shore to shore.

Our Princess bears a jewel—'tis the flawless gem of Trust;
And if the find a foeman in the ohivalrous old land,

She relies, and so relying shall be lighted safe and sound,
Like the Lady of the legend, o'er each foot of the Green Isle
Where an Irish heart is found.

"OPEN SESAME!"
People have long been arguing—and with their arguments
Mr. Punch sympathises—in favour of opening the National Gallery
on Sundays, in order that those who get few other holidays may
have a chance of looking at the Pictures on that day. The week in
which Good Friday fell was, however, a week in which many of the
olats whom Sunday opening is intended to bent tit did get holidays.
Well, "X." writes to the Times this month to say that, on the
Thursday and Saturday in that particular week, the National
Gallery was—open rather earlier, and closed rather later than usual?
Not at all! It was " closed for cleaning." So that any laborious, but
Art-loving artisan or poor clerk who might fancy a peep at the new
Raphael or Vandyke that the Nation has paid so much money for on
either of those days wouldn't be able to get it, the Galleries in which
they are displayed being in a state of mops and brooms." If, in
disguBt, he should have got into a similar condition—figuratively
speaking—that would be advanced as a reason, not for opening Gal-
leries, but for closing Public-houses. If " X." is right, it seems to
Mr. P. that somebody else must be wrong here. Unless—which
seems hardly likely—there is some very conclusive reason for closing
the Gallery on those particular days, having them closed in the face
of those who then might seek entrance, appears to be a " superfluity
of naughtiness."

—In order to make the St. James's Music-Hall thoroughly enjoyable,
and a formidable rival to the Pavilion and other similar establish-
ments, we are pleased to hear, though we repeat the information
with the greatest caution and without expressing the least confidence
in our informant, that the Directors contemplate setting apart the
centre portion of the Gallery for Smokers, and refreshments may be
served here only during the intervals. Any Waiter uncorking a
bottle of effervescing drink during the performance of Music, will be
instantly dismissed, as it is not intended to mix the Philharmonic up

PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
MY MUSICAL CLIENT.
"Bbief, Sir!" said my admirable and exoellent Clerk to me one
morning, as he opened the door of my Chambers.
I looked at the bundle of papers which had been so unexpectedly
placed in my hands with astonishment and joy, and carried it in
triumph to my desk. The news of the glorious affair was quickly
circulated, and 'numbers of my professional friends practising on
the same stair-
case dropped in
to offer me per-
sonally their
hearty congratu-
lations. My brief
was passed from
hand to hand,
provoking ex-
pressions of envy
and admiration.
It was immedi-
ately admitted
to be perfectly
genuine.
"As I ex-
pected!" at
length exclaim-
ed one of my
friends, who in-
variably fills
Moans."
"What sort of man is he ?" I asked, rather nervously, as my
friend's tone was calculated to arouse apprehension. "Quite rational,
I suppose. Not"
"Oh, no," was the answer, "not that. Only very eccentric"
1 explained that I had no evidence of his eccentricity before me.
On the contrary, I oonsidered.his sending, me a brief a very sensible
and proper proceeding.
"No doubt," was the dry response; "but I don't think you would
have not it had Bkownk been in the way."
And as this seemed to be the general impression, there was no
more to be. said. On the retirement of my visitors, my Clerk informed
me-that the-papers-had-betn left by « small boy,-with a.massage that
Mr. Handel Moans would like to see me at once. I waited for
some time in expectation of his coming, but as he did not appear, I
determined to visit him myself. I do not stand upon ceremony
when my clients' interests are at stake. I argued that at that very
moment he might be eagerly looking for my assistance.
I hurried to the address on my brief, Paint Alley, Strand,
W.C. As I passed in, I heard the. sounds of a piano, upon which
was being played, with much brilliancy of touch, a sort of French
jig, and reflected that such music must be a sad disturbance to
Mr. Moans, deeply engrossed in the business of his numerous olients.
Two minutes later I was ushered into Mr. Moans' tanctum. A
gentleman, with long black hair, sprang up from a piano at which he
was seated, and shook hands with me with a heartiness perfeotly
painful.
"I expected to Bee Mr. Moans," I faltered out. "Do you know
when he will be back P"
"My name is Moans— Handel Moans," returned the long-
haired gentleman; "and I want your advice."
Recovering from my astonishment, I said I supposed he wished to
consult with me about Stocks versus Stubbing!.
"Oh, Stocks versus Stuhbings be blowed!"—T regret to say he
used rather a stronger word than " blowed "—" Browne will tell us
all about that. No; I want to ask you about— this."
And before I could compose myself to listen to an expected intri-
cate point of law, he had turned round on his piano-stool and was
•tramming away on the instrument before him with the utmost
energy, the sort of French jig 1 had already heard.
"There!" he said, finishing with a bang, "how's that for Prince
Piptyvnpsy f"
I was puzzled what to reply. I had read the instructions I had
received in Stocks versus Stubbings, but did not remember the name
of Prince Pipstwipsy—nor in fact any other Soion of Royalty. The
case seemed to me to turn upon an alleged assault with a pint pot,
•aid to have been committed, in a moment of extreme irritation, upon
the husband of a charwoman.
"Was that the music that was the cause of the quarrel P" I asked
after some consideration.
Mr. Handel Moans stared at me for a moment, still smiling, but
not quite so cordially. At last he asked me if I were " Briefless P"
"And," he continued, "aren't you a member of the Green Curtain
Club, and didn't you write the words of 'Hansom is as Hansom
does, or the Piccadilly Cabby' t" ■
I saw the error at a glance I Mr. Handel Moans had mistaken
me for a cousin of mine of the same name, with whom I am on very
distant terms. I explained my identity.
"Ah! but you belong to the same family, and I daresay have lent
your oousin a helping hand before now," said Mr. Moans with re-
turning heartiness. "Now, isn't this yours P" And before I could
reply, he sang in stentorian tones the following doggerel:—
"In and out the Law Court,
With a 'How d'ye do P * 'Tar-tar!'
A doing of the 'Rorty Tort'
And Reading for the Bar!"
As I have a scrupulous regard for truth, I confessed that I had
had something to do with " The Outer Temple Man" (of whioh the
above was the refrain), although entirely repudiating the chorus.
"I am sorry for that," said Mr. Moans, "as the chorus is the
best part of it. However, I am glad I sent you the brief, although I
don't suppose Browne will ever let us hear the end of it.
On further investigation it turned out that Mr. Moans, having
several members of lhe theatrical "profession" as clients, hod
managed to get an Opera Bouffe, of which he was the composer,
accepted _ at a West End theatre. He was at that moment
engaged in rehearsing his bantling, leaving the business of his own
profession in the hands of his chief clerk, Mr. Browne. I regret
to say that when that person discovered I had been briefed by his
master, he obstinately refused to afford me any assistance, and I had
to get all my instructions from Mr. Handel Moans himself. It was
a very difficult task. I had to run my olient to earth on the
stage of the Terpsiohore Theatre, where I held hurried consultations
which he used to mix up "with details connected with his Optra
Bouffe, and consequently we sometimes made mistakes.
It may be asked why I went on with the matter P I can only
reply that by some unlucky ohanoe (I believe that that villain
Browne was at the bottom of it) the husband of the oharwoman got
hold of my name and address, and made me personally responsible
for every unpleasantness. _ At length the position became so
embarrassing that I determined to have it out with my olient, and
tell him that if he did not immediately pay proper attention to
Stocks versus Stubbings 1 must return my brief. I accosted him
once again behind the scenes at the Terpsichore Theatre.
"Return your brief!" he exclaimed. "Why, my friend, you never
had such a chanoe in your life. And now don't bother any more about
that affair, but look through the slit in the curtain at the House.
•Notbadioraaecondnight,Althaugh thaPresa has. given us a slating.".
The First Aot was over. I looked through the hole as requested,
and noticed that there was rather a thin audience, except in the
Dress-oirole, whioh was nearly full. However, to balance their
numbers in this part of the auditorium, the.spectators (who were
constantly turning their heads towards the box-doors as if eagerly
expecting the entrance of someone) seemed to be either almost
moved to tears, or with difficulty controlling the most savage anger.
I called Mr. Moans' attention to their emotions.
"Oh, it isn't at the piece," he replied, quickly, "you see I told
a few of my clients to meet me here this evening, on the second
night, when the opera would have been produced, and I could have
time to attend to them. But the fact is there is such a lot of things
still to do, that to keep them quiet I have had to have them all
passed into the Dress-circle to wait for me." And, calling to the
property-man to follow him, he was seen no more that evening.
When I reached home, I heard that there had been a disturbance
with the husband of the charwoman, whose wrongs had driven him
to drinking. Fortunately I had just received an offer to take my
house furnished from a quiet Country Clergyman who, having let his
sea-side residence, was anxious to come to London for a little relax-
ation. I closed with him at once, leaving him (as a man of peaoe) to
settle with the charwoman's husband while 1 and my family went
quietly down the next morning to Southend for a holiday. After
the inquest I returned to town and resumed practice. One day,
passing by Paint Alley, I thought I would look-up Mr. Handel
Moans, and see if there was any chance of renewing my connection;
for truth to tell, I really could not afford to lose a client in those days
(it was some years ago)—nay, I cannot afford to lose one even now.
"Now, Sir," oried a bullying-looking person, who was occupying
Mr. Moans' ohair, "I tell you that if you are Prince Pipsiwipst's
husband, as I suppose you are, you won't get a penny more. Mr.
Handel Moans has sola his practice to me, and has gone to Russia
as the Musical Conductor of a travelling Burlesque Company."
"But I am not Prince Pipsywtpsy's husband," I replied, with a
conciliatory smile. "The fact is I was professionally engaged in
'Stocks versus Stubbings,' and"
"Ah, to be sure." returned Mr. Moans' successor, grimly.
"Well, we sent the oharwoman's husband into penal servitude for
life, and as for you, Sir, it is my impression that you won't get
much from this office—no, Sir, not much." And, in spite of his
brutal frankness, he was quite right—I have never got any!

EXTRACTED FROM

THE TORTURE CHAMBER. QUESTION-TIME.
A Scene at St. Stephen's, Westminster—after George Cruilshank's Illustrations in " The Tower of London," dc.
House of Commons, Monday Night, March 30. — Fifty-nine
Questions on the paper for to-night; twenty-nine Irish, of usual
thrilling interest, though we haven't yet reached that one whioh stands
in the name of Joseph Gillis, and inquires about alleged delin-
quencies at the Post-Office, 292, Fulham Road. Remarkable man,
Joseph. Whilst everybody thought his attention concentrated on
the iniquities of the Guardians of the Ballyahoy Union, he has had
his eye on Fulham Road. Thoroughfare hitherto rejoiced in convic-
tion that it was so long and unwieldy, might pursue its course with
impunity. If Joey B. was on the look-out for anything in London,
he would take a nice quiet short street like Stratton Street, or New
Burlington Street, for example. Nothing shorter than Fulham Road
suits genius of Joseph, and no number less than 292 excites his
interest.
Nobody minds Irish Questions, not even Campbell-Banherman,
who reads, without emotion, prodigious answers Irish Office places
in his hands. By-and-by, when he's stronger in his place, C. B.
will doubtless summarise these little histories, which are as minute
as a description in the Police Gazette, and as scrupulously informing
as a Town Direotory. _No reason why answers to Irish Members
should be more voluminous than replies on matters of Imperial
interest. Chief Secretary should study answers of Lord Esmond

House of Commons in the Session of 1815, he would have a-ked the
Attorney-General under what law tha Emperor Napoleon was
detained at St. Helena."
Finally the Irish Members name on with the perennial question of
Inspector MuupHr, on whioh they talked till miinight.
"Always thought you were against the police," I said to my
friend Josiph Oaus, as we rode home in 'hus together. "How is
it you 're always ohampioning Polioeman Murphy? Did you always
admire himP"
"No," said Joey B., with his charming frankness; "only sinoe he
was dismissed the Force."
Business done.—A couple of Votes in Civil Service Estimates.
Tuetday.— More of the Torture Chamber. Harttngton eti'l on
the rack. W. E. G. flown at Brighton. Report ourrent in House
that he was seen there this morning, dressed in serge suit, short
jacket, straw hat with blue ribbon (" Indomitable" stamped on it),
walking up and down Pier with telescope under his arm. But this
probably exaggeration;*' — —
Not much to be got out of Hartington, though Asiimean B.irt-
LETi turned the screws and pulled the levers, intending, as he said,
to "leave not a rack behind." Principal Question of the day,
whether House shall be permitted to rise for Adjournment at Seven
o'Clook, or whether Speaker, Officials, and a Quorum of Members
must be dragged down again at Nine? Rumours ab.mt of contem-
plated dirty triok on part of Pamellites. But no one believed it.
Special arrangements made for letting ihem blow off steam yesterday.
Really had nothing to talk about, till happy thought struck Sexton
of bringing over from Cinada.pqe.JOHN Botle O'Reilly, oonvioted
of Fenianism twenty years ago, escaped from prison, and now wants
permission to visit Canada and the old country.
This cannot be made to last very long. Dropped at Six o'Clock.
Adjournment at Seven seemed certain. Iu despair, Abthue
O'Connor obliged to fall back on Soudan. Proposes, amid oheers
from Joseph Gillis, to hand over to the Soudanese women the
light-hearted and amiable gentleman at that moment promenading
Parade at Brighton, and discussing weather forecast with Coast-
guardsmen. W. Redmond next started topic of meeting prohibited
at Wexford. This also fell through. All this, bewildered reader
must understand, to k place on Question whether the House
should at its rising adjourn for the Easter Recess.
Twenty minutes to tJeven now. In ten minutes the debate, if not
concluded, must stand adjourned, and House must meet again at Nine
o'Clock. Pamellites almost in despair. Kenny saved them. Began
a few remarks on French Fishermen on the Irish coast, which plea-
santly whiled away remaining minutes, and, with groan of augry
despair, Members found they must needs upset all their arrangem-n ts
and return at Nine o'Clock. Having brought about this, the Par-
nellites did not even make pretence of keeping up debate, and at Ten
o'Clook Motion for Adjournment was carried, and House separated
till Thursday, April 9th.
_ "A glorious viotory this," I said to Joseph Gillis. "Perhaps a
little tainted with breach of honourable understanding, but still
worthy of an organised political party representative of a great
Nation."
"Yes," said Joseph, twisting his comforter round his neck. "I
think we did it pretty well. They could not believe we'd do such a
thing. Never been done before. So we let them make all their
arrangements, and then oarae in and tipped them over."
And Joseph laughed. I 'm afraid he's a little dense. Anyone
else would have seen I was speaking sarcastically.

Chaptee III.—The Courteous Stranger.
O'Dwyer had dined—rapidly, with eleotrio speed, after the manner
of his race. He sauntered into the Hall of the " Shortham," partly
with the purpose of ascertaining whether a Hairdresser and a
Dentist, essential to his Trans-Atlantio peace and comfort, were kept
in the establishment, partly to make up his mind as to the choice
of amusement for the evening.
In the vast and shadowy hall of the hostelry, reading the Bills of
the various Theatres, O'Dwier beheld the oourteous stranger who
had bowed so deeply after their casual encounter near the Blenheim
Club. O'Dwyer recognised him with his stately courtesy, and the
two gradually entered on conversation.
"What can one see to-night of the entertainments of the people,"
asked O-Dwyer. . .. - — _
"If I might presume, Sir, to offer a suggestion to one so skilled in
all the finer arts of life," said the stranger, "and so well acquainted
with the resources of the Metropolis, it would be that the perform-
ances of Miss O'Bothehton repay perusal."
"Whit can the man mean?' thought O'Dwyer, "/don't know
the resources of this foreign Metropolis."
"Miss O'Bothehton," the elaborate Stranger went on, "at the
head of the Hiberno-American troupe,—quite a novelty, is bewitch-
ing the town as Hermume, in A WinUrs Tale."
So be it," replied O'Dwyer, "A Winter* Tale for Midsummer
Eve 1 May I hope to have the partnership, in this pleasure, of the
gentleman who so kindly assists my seleotion with his judgment?"
"His prinoely courtesy," muttered the 8tranger, aside, "almost
unmans me! But my vow!" In three minutes, and a hansom cab,
the pair were on their wayto the Mausoleum.
Chapter IV.—Miss O'Botherton.
Dfspite the heat and the lateness of the season, Miss O'Bothehton,
a slight, dark, lively brunette, was entrancing a orowded house at the
Mausoleum. Deftly treading his war over the toes of the oooupants
of the Stalls, who rose with a polite alacrity, and stared with a
curious interest that amazed him, O'Dwyer followed his new
friend to two unoccupied seats in an advantageous position. He waa
delighted with all he beheld, as a Patriot with the applause and
bouquets showered on his beautiful countrywoman, as a Critic by
the brilliant alacrity and verve with which she bustled merrily
through her lively part. H-r vivacious manner of glancing at the
Gallery, when, after descending as a statue from the pede«tal, she
exclaims, "You gods, look down," charmed the austere O'Dwter.
"A perfeotly novel and quite too audaciously infallible interpreta-
tion of the divine Bard," he murmured,—as he excitedly clapped his
hands,—to his new acquaintance.
"She has indeed, Sir, as much wit and discretion as she has
beauty," replied the Stranger, "and is an old family friend of my
own besides. May I hope, Sir, that you will aocept my humble
hospitality, and ' meet with ohampagne and a chicken in the society
of Mermione t"
"You do a stranger too much honour," replied O'Dwyer. "Arid
when the lovely Statue descends, and 'is stone no more,' it shall be
my pride to accompany you into her bewitching presence."
The Stranger bowed his acknowledgments, the Curtain fell, and
O'Dwyer was soon following his unexpectedly delightful host in the
direotion of the/oyer.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
MT PBIZE PUPIL.
Feeling that during the present plethora of Queen's Counsel I
might prove a cause of embarrassment, if not indeed sorrowful
annoyance, to the Lord Chancellor if I applied to him for " Silk,"
I determined to utilise the privilege of a Junior" by becoming a
"Coach." Of course I did not for a moment expect to rival in
success so popular a "guide, philosopher, and friend," as Mr.
Shbarwood, the learned author of a number of admirable treatises,
but I trusted that with diligence and study I might perhaps be able
to help some faint-hearted and faltering student to climb up that
combined ladder of Roman Law, Real Property, Common Law, and
Equity, which leads to that proud pinnacle in the Temple of Forensio
Fame known as the degree of Utter Barrister. To carry out this
laudable, and I hoped lucrative programme, it became necessary for
me to learn some law myself.' Owing to a variety of circumstances, I
had not made the science of my profession so much my especial study
as its practice, consequently 1 found myself a little "rusty." How-
aver, I brushed up my schoolboy knowledge of the Classics, and
fiercely tackled the Latin intricacies of Justinian, filling up the
remainder of my time (except that, of course, devoted to my
strictly professional duties) with peeps into Joshua Williams' little
works upon Real and Personal Property,'and glanoes at Shell's
excellent brochure upon Equity. After two terms and a long
vacation's unceasing work, I ventured to test my knowledge by
securing and attempting to answer (without the assistance of my
text-books) the papers set for examination in Lincoln's Inn Hall. I
allowed myself double the ordinary time to compensate for my lost
youth. Having completed the task, I checked my replies with the
Bar Journal with the following not ungratifying result. I found
that in Roman Law I had answered one question partly right and
several incorrectly, in Real Property all the questions incorrectly, in
Common Law one question nearly right and many incorrectly, and
in Equity one whole question entirely right and several incorrectly.
Having thus attained to what I may fairly claim to call without
laying myself open to the charge of intellectual arrogance, a state of
high proficiency, I ventured to insert the following advertisement in
ouiuo ul uur lea ling daily papers :—
TO GENTLEMEN wishing to adopt the BAR as a PROFESSION.—
An Utter Barrister of one of the Inns of Court, of many years' stand-
ing, having a little spare time on his hands, caused by the occasional pauses
in the proceedings incidental to a life employed in a most extensive Prac-
tice, is prepared to impart Instruction to a few Students desirous of climbing
to the loftiest heights of a noble Profession. Apply for particulars to
A. B. J., Pump Handle Court, Temple, E.C.
Business being slack at the time, I waited in my Chambers for
days, in expectation of receiving some answer to my announcement.
For a time I was disappointed. Still, I continued sitting with my
wig, gown, and bands artistically grouped around me, to suggest
that, although I took Pupils, I was still actively engaged in the
duties of my Profession; and my perseverance was at length re-
warded by the entrance of a visitor. The person who stood before
me wore a long Newmarket coat, a very tight pair of trousers, a
diamond horse-shoe pin, and a curly-brimmed hat. He was smok-
ing a very strong cigar (for which he apologised), and carried a
'.-handled stick.
. , will allow me to explain myself," he said, seating
ilf on a side-table, and upsetting my brief bag and its hidden
store of co-operative luxuries. I bowed and toyed with nay wig.
"The faot is I have made a bet that I will pass the Bar Examina-
tion within three months. I was dining a short time ago with a lot
of chappies, and an old stick, of the name of Wigblock"
"Do you mean the eminent Queen's Counsel?" I asked.
"That's the party. My name's Horselaugh. Well, old'."Wig-
block .'swore I knew nothing about law. I told him I knew as
much as he,—and backed my opinion. Said I would pass the Bar
Examination, more than he had ever done. I took him three to
one that I would do the trick in three months' time. All the other
chappies took me too. It looked too good a thing to miss. Well,
as I am a bit short just now, I want to pull it off, if I can ; so, seeing
your Advertisement, and, thinking 4 A. B. J.' sounded rather chirpy,
I came to look you up—and, here I am."
Further inquiries brought out that my visitor and would-be pupil
was a younger son of the Earl of Stablecloth. He seemed an ener-
getic young gentleman, having already obtained entrance to an Inn
of Court, and passed the Preliminary Examination.
"Well," said I, with a smile, "we cannot do better than com-
mence at onoe. If you will kindly remove those briefs from that
easy-chair, you will find a seat, and I will tell you something about
the powers of a paterfamilias, and the full meaning of the word
'potesta*,' as shadowed, forth by the Emperor Justinian."
"All right," said he. "But if you do, it must be in a Hansom.
I am due at Tattersall's in half-an-hour, but if you like to come
with me, we might ohat it over in the ca£."
And this was the commencement of our studies. Mr. Horse-
laugh turned out to be a thoroughly amiable young fellow, and I
determined to do my lbest to help him to pass his Examination.
True, his aim was scarcely to "olimb to the loftiest heights of a
noble Profession," being, in point of faot, rather to gain oertain
wagers unsanctioned by any Court of Law other than that of
Honour; and yet his ambition was a noble one. I found that so
general was the impression that he would fail to qualify (as much as
twenty to one was offered against him freely), that it seemed oertain
that did he attain sucoess, my fame as a "coach" would be estab-
lished. His family were most anxious for his triumph, believing
that his exertions were due to his intense desire to practise in the
Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice. Our reading had
only one drawback—a serious one—that I was forced to accompany
him on all his excursions. He pointed out to me that he could not
really spare the time to give up any of his "engagements," so I had
to test him in Personalty between the races at Sandown, put him
through his paoes about Expressed Trusts during the pauses of a
convivial Oarrick Club Dinner, and see how he had progressed in
Contracts when he had " out out" of a rubber at the Portland. At
first this caused some slight annoyance at my private residence, and
I was tried in the Court of my Hearth and Home for coming in
rather late one night, or early one morning, wearing somebody else's

Rapid Progress with a Slow Coach.
hat, and clasping in my hand a supper-bill from a well-known
Leicester Square Restaurant. However, my defence, so far as it
went, was deemed satisfactory. I explained that I had spent the
evening in attempting to teach Mr. Horselaugh the distinction
between a Contingent and a "Vested Remainder.
At length the first Day of Examination arrived. The Council of
Legal Education, no doubt to show their Spartan apathy for every-
thing outside their scholastic duties, had selected a well-known
sporting "fixture" for the date of the contest. I had had some
difficulty in persuading my pupil to forego the pleasures of the Turf,
to be present at Lincoln s Inn, but had ultimately succeeded by
getting him to back himself lor what he called the " Examination
Selling Stakes," for further sums of money.
On the memorable morning I overslept myself, and, consequently,
did not reaoh the Hall of Lincoln's Inn until the Candidates had
taken their places within that handsome edifice. I rather regretted
this, as I should have liked to have given Mr. Horselaugh a few
additional hints about the incidents of Common Socage Tenure,—a
matter about which he knew little or nothing. Trusting that the
subject would not be broached either in the papers or viva voce, I
walked up and down in the gardens outside the Hall, awaiting
anxiously the moment when Mr. Horselaugh would oome out and
give me an account of his adventures. The feeling of anxiety
became so acute, that I determined to walk to my Chambers and
back to kill the time of waiting. On Reaching Pump- Handle Court,
my admirable and excellent Clerk handed me a telegram. It was
from my pupil, and was dated " Epsom" 1 He had preferred the
Derby to the Bar, for he never again entered for an Examination 1

""Welcome, little Stranger!"
"Yes,' he's come back with the violets and the primroses and the other most
tender offerings of Spring," said Wolff, gazing fondlv at his revered Chiel.
As for Randolph, he resumed his old seat, and twirled moustache as if
nothing particular had happened. Not affected even when Stafford Nobthcote
rose from Front Bench, crossed the Gangway, and warmly shook his hand.
".Welcome,'little Stranger! " said Sir Stafford.
"How do, old man? Keeping up your pecker?" said
Randolph. And the two parted. How simple are the
ways of the Truly Great I
Though attendance small, excitement great. News has
me that Russia has been "going it'ron the frontier.
Not going to war exactly; only Killing five hundred
Afghans, routing the rest, and taking a fortified town.
What will Gladstone say to this? everybody asking.
Then everybody discovers Gladstone not present.
Excitement grows. "Where is he?" asked Stafford
Northcote. "Coming presently," replied Harcottrt.
Messages by telephone and messengers in cabs despatched
to Downing Street. Presently Premier comes in, flushed
and breathless, with a great red rose stuck in his button-
hole.
"He's been""walking in the .Temple Gardens with
De Staal, and has plucked a red rose," Arthur Balfour
whispered to Sclater-Booth. "De-Penjdeh upon it, it
means war."
"They'd never walk in the Temple Gardens," says
Sclater-Booth, positively. "It's too public a place.
Besides, there are no roses there. It's too early for cm."
Gladstone confirmed the worst news about Russian
advance. Spoke with manifest restraint that deepened
the impression. House listened in silence, asked a few
businesslike questions, and then went into Committee of
Supply, discussing with all its heart and soul whether a
sum of £8000 should be voted on account of Sheriffs'
Court Houses in Scotland, and other burning questions
of similar character.
Long discussion on vote for new Admiralty and War
Offices. Sir Peel led opposition. When division became
imminent, left Front Benoh and went over to Irish camp,
openly soliciting aid.
"Which way is the Goovernment goin' to vote?"
Joseph Gillis asked, with his judicial air.
"For the estimate, of course," said Sir Perl. "Then
we '11 go agin 'em," said J. B.; and they did.
Business done.—Some votes in Civil Serv ice Estimates.
Friday.—Only* thirteen Questions on the paper to-
night, the odd one being Irish. Consequence was that
be) :ore Five o'Clock House in Committee mending Seats
Bill. Explanation of absence of Irish Questions found
in f aot of absence of Irish Secretary and Solicitor-General.
Here's an obvious hint for the House. Double salaries
of these two Ministers, and invite them to reside in
Dublin during the Parliamentary Session. Beg to give
notice that I shall move this on Civil Service Estimates
on Vote for Salaries of Irish Law Lords.
Business done.—A long dull night, hammering away
at the Seats Bill, which gets a little forrader.

Henceforth be careful what you 're at,
Nor be your conduct shabby.
You hear the Pussies out at nights,
With voices loud and raucous,
Well, they 're die cussing feline rights,
A regular Cat Cauous.
Grown bold with speeches, next we find
Their conduct waxing ruder,
Three Cats attacked, with rage unkind,
A masculine intruder.
They covered both his hands and face
With horrid wounds and scratches,
They routed him with deep disgrace,
And left his clothes in patches.
Take warning then from this man's fate,
Nor bid the Cats defiance,
But rather try to formulate
The terms of an alliance.
Three Cats alone it seems began,
By raising wheals and blisters,
What if they join, 'gainst tyrant Man,
The band of 'shrieking Sisters!

'shpeotful n'tral'ty." We lunch at the Castle. (As we do this every
day, and generally retire there between the shows for a wash and a
brush-up, I propose to save time by borrowin' a metamorphosis from
Chess, and simply reoordin' "Castles" for the future. Me friend,
Herr Sugabtongs, approves av this concise journalistic gambit.) The
Di-Spencer av hospitalities in fine form, Adykongs flourishin' about,
lovely Shebeens (Irish for Hebes), handin' round cups, liveried
Leprechauns waitin' on us, long-banished Banshees flittin about, a
musician playin' with a Falconer's voice on the Dublin Recorder (a
musioal instrument peculiar to the Green Isle, and particularly to
Green Street), sivinteen gold plates laid for the Corporators, and
Spencf.b's "Fairy Queen" doin' the honours right Vice-royally!
There's a sketch of a Royal luncheon with' lashins an' lavins for

At last time was up, the Equerry an' I gobbled up the last delicious
savoury— Savourneen deelith they call it over here—shanghrauned
to the Illustrious—an ancient form of Celtio salutation—and with a
final three times three, an' a " Tip—Tip—Tip—erary I" we went off
to the Cattle Show.
Passin' the deserted and dissolute Mansion House, we noticed a
melancholy pair in the top story lookin' the picture av despair, the
new flag (only a week old) was doin' a little furtive flap on its own
account whin it thought the Lord Mayor wasn't lookin', but we sang
"Bye, bye. Baby Bunting!" and away with us to Ball's Bridge.
Ball wasn't at home, but his bridge was, and here we met all the
brave boys and purty girls av Dublin Town, the wits av the
"Sheridan" and the University, the Rakes of " Kildare 8treet," the
soldiers from Stephen's Green, the Friendly Brothers, the still
unohristened Saokville Streeters, an' the sivinteen Municipalities.
Sueh le'pin' an' jumpin' never was seen. Fences as high as Kelson's
pillar-post-office, the glory of Saokville Street, an' brooks as broad
as the Dodder were crossed like—well, like cheques whether they
were "negotiable" or not, and thin we went to the Shorthorns.
Here I encountered a dilemma. Sorra entry had been made in this
class, and not a horn or tail, long or short, was to be seen.
The Lord-Liftinant was looking cross, Mr. Gibson was growlin',
and Mr. Plunkett peroratin' profusely. Lord Powebscoubt weepin
like his own waterfall, the uncrowned King Harm an, and Lord
Abdillaun, who oame over with the Cong-quest, were in despair,
and all the rest av the quality, the Murphies, the Doolies, an
Rannigans at their wits' end. But a quick word in the ear av Sir
John Babbington did it, and whin we reached the pen, sure enough
there were sivinteen stall-feds standin' with their backs to us. They
looked as if their skins didn't fit them, to be sure, but anyhow they
stood the proddin' an' the vivd voce criticisms passed on them, an' as
we drove home I secretly scored another good mark in favour of the
loyal and devoted sivinteen.
Thursday.—We go slummin', an' find ourselves in the dirty depths
av the Coombe. Save us! What sights an' smells!
"Ye peroaive, Sir," sez I, with a twinkle, "that this isn't a
Honey Coombe, anyhow 1"
But the Prince, though he smiled, spoke grave and solemn.
"It's no laughin' matter, Tim O'Roonet. Poverty an' bad
housin' are enemies that I've been tryin' to destroy in London, an'
maybe I '11 tackle them here. I'm obliged to Mr. Healy for
his suggestion." (This was, av course, annoyin' to the other Tilt.)
An' he ran up a rickety staircase,'an', when we got up, it was a case
of stare, I tell you! Howanever, tor man, woman, an' child the
Illustrious had a soft word; and so pleasant was he, that I had great
difficulty in preventin' Mrs. O'Mulligan, the sub-lessee of a wan

We escaped, an', wandering through the dens that huddle round the
hase of St. Patrick's grey arches and towers, came on the Model Lodging
Houses. Ireland is an artistic country, an' these nate villas was built
to hold the various models, male and female, used by the painters and
sculptors, and generally what they call "the Artist-an olass." Sir
Thomas Jones, P.R.H.A, walked round with us, explaining the Models.*
"I should like to see all these poor folk at work, said the Illustrious,
thoughtfully; and then Sir Thomas showed him how to drop a pennyin
the slit av the letter-box, an' sure enough the Models worked. The
Prince was delighted, an' sez to me, in a whisper, "TrM, that's quite

eame to the door av the Prisenoe Chamber, and then the boys
were compressed like air in a pop-gun. At intervals the door
opened; Pop! Bang! a solid lump of Levee-ists was shot into the
Prisence 1 Then the lump disintegrated itself, and its particles
resolved themselves into bows and scrapes and crab-like waddles.
Wan av these lumps described a" graceful parabola, and fallin'
right at the Royal feet, splintered into sivinteen pieces, and
there were the brave Corporators 1 "United we fall, divided we
stand," they said, as they picked themselves up and made their
beautif ul.bows. I noticed that each of them wore a new deoo-
ration, consisting of a brand-new half-crown slung on a blue
ribbon, but how they got that half-crown, or what it signified,
is a mystery that at this present writin' I dare not divulge.
After " Castling " with the Equerry, I looked in at the Alex-
andra College, where Miss La Touch k and all her wise and
merry maidens welcomed the fairy godmother of their big school.
There I met nine real live Oirl Graduates in hoods 'an' caps an'
gowns! (The other girls wore gowns, too, but these gowns
were—you understand.) The Nine Muses couldn't hold a candle
to them, but, b'lieve me, these omniscient colleens had burnt
many a candle in quest av the Muses before they dared to call
themselves "Bachelors.'' I venture to suggest to Miss La

(Very Newest Panic Style. N.B.—For further Illustration see

THE PRESENT CRISIS.
Reception of the Intelligence in the Lobbies.
The reception of the intelligence in the Lobbies was, says the
Morning Steam-Roller, even to those intimately acquainted with
what may he termed the more family aspect of Parliamentary life,
quite startling in its intensity. For the first fire hours nobody
could be got to believe it; and though several Members who had just
seen the Prime Minister calling wildly for smelling-salts, with
blanched cheeks and his hair standing on end, went raving towards
the waterside Terrace, with their teeth chattering in an agony of
terror, they were merely locked out by order of the Home Secre-
tary, who apparently not yet in the secret, imagined that some
excellent practical joke had been played upon a few distinguished
foreigners visiting the Strangers' Gallery by a well-known high-
spirited Radical below the Gangway. Later, however, as the real
truth began to get known, the effect in every portion of the building
was electrical. Conservatives and Liberals alike, Members of the
Government and leaders of the Opposition, staggered towards the
tea-room, weeping like children, and shaking each other's hand in
silence. Perhaps the most striking, certainly the most characteristic
scene of all, was that supplied by a little picturesque crowd of
reporters standing mutely round the prostrate form of the Speaker,
who, having gone completely off his head, was quietly seated on the
pavement, holding his wig under his arm as he endeavoured, with
evident effort, but with an appealing smile, to whistle a portion, of
the bass of "Rule, Britannia .'"
The Activity at the Admiralty.
As soon as the true position of affairs began to be fully realised
this morning at the Admiralty, not a moment was lost in taking
every possible step to hasten on some scheme for the consideration
of precautionary measures, without further delay. Orders were at
once sent to Portsmouth to refit the Victory, and purchase, and pnt
into immediate commission as many of the vessels of the Ryde
Steam Packet Company as could be regarded Bea-worthy, and avail-
able for immediate active service against a powerful Iron-clad Fleet
in the North Pacific. Favourable reports were received later in the
day from Plymouth, where it is understood that, with the number
of extra hands now taken on for over-time work, the Cumbrous,
Qlutton, Swamper, and Styx— all the bottoms of which had, owing
to some trilling defect in their construction, suddenly come out
during the progress of their respective trial-trips on the measured
mile—will be ready for sea in the course of the next nineteen
months. The patterns of the guns for these vessels, which are cal-
culated, when chased by an enemy, to be able to steam quite seven
knots an hour, are already attracting the attention of the Authorities
at Woolwich; and it is confidently expected that, as soon as the
vessels are afloat, experiments will be made forthwith to test their
capabilities of carrying any at all.
The Feeling in America.
The excitement caused here by the news is tremendous, Wall Street
speculators literally tearing each other to pieces, on it being reported
this morning on good authority, that the entire fleet of passenger
ships on all the Atlantic lines, comprising in all seventeen companies,
had been purchased by the Russian Government, and paid for in
advance in coupons of a new 13 per cent, loan issued at 32. The
result of this announcement had a most exhilarating effect on all

Home Stocks, it being at once foreseen that if the whole carrying
trade of the country should -virtually go to the bottom of the
Atlantic, native produce would command firmer and healthier prices.
The fact that the British War Office have also within the last few
hours bought by cable 15,000,000 tons of Canned Asparagus has
caused a good effect. A long and bloody war is eagerly watched for,
and will be hailed by thoughtful politicians of all parties as
heralding a brisk period of unusual commercial satisfaction and
prosperity.
Public Opinion on the Continent.
The St. Petersburg Gazette (semi-offioial), referring to the crisis,
says that neither the tension on the London Stock Exchange nor the
alleged dancing of the hornpipe by Mr. Gladstone at a Cabinet
Council, are to be accounted for by suoh trifling incidents as the
seizure of both banks of the Indus in force, and the precautionary
shelling of Columbo; but it admits that in well-informed diplomatic
circles it is thoroughly understood at Constantinople that if the
situation becomes a little more acute (uti pea plus chaud), the Sultan
will not only lend Russia his moral support, but cheerfully guarantee,
for a small consideration, half the expenses of the opening campaign
out of his own private means by notes of hand to any amount desired,
payable at sight.
At Paris the news created at first some slight stir on the Bourse,
the Preferred Shares of the Companie des Bains de Mer Chauds
Transatlantiqaes showing a sympathetic downward movement, but
there was a quick recovery later on, the rumour being circulated
that in the event of Austro-Hungary and Germany throwing in their
lot with Russia, the Duke of Cambridge would himself at once take
the field with half a battery of muzzle-loading artillery and all the
available troops now stationed at Aldershot.
PUBLIC GRIEVANCES.
(By Our Own Inspector.)
No. VIII.—Correspondence.
T may appear
strange, and
even incompre-
hensible to some,
but the griev-
ance that seems
to produce a
larger amount
of irritability
than any other
is Correspond-
ence, whether it
be unnecessary,
frivolous, and
therefore vexa-
tious, or illegi-
ble. This last
especially is
spoken of by
many as causing
perhaps a larger
amount of pro-
fane language
to be used than
even brass
bands.
I subjoin some
speoimens:—
Sir,—I am, I believe^ blessed with a remarkably good temper,
and I am fain to believe that I am rather singular in that
respect, judging from the numerous specimens of dogged obstinacy
and absurd irritability that I see around me. But my admirable
temper is sorely tried by the mass of utterly frivolous correspondence
with which I am deluged. I have, I regret to say, a large family
connection, principally living in the country, and my wife, I even
more regret to say, has a very large family connection, principally,
but not exclusively, I regret to say, living in the country: and as I
am naturally looked up to as the head of the family, or rather of the
two families, from my presumed ample means, my spotless charaoter,
and. my lofty position as a Common Councilman of the City of London,
my advice is daily sought by some idiotio member of my illustrious
race, upon suoh utterly frivolous matters that I positively rave with
indignation, and reply in a way that brings me six or seven pages ef
pained remonstranoe necessitating an ample apology. Fanoy, Sir,
being asked by an aged but wealthy female relative for an exact
description of the dresses worn by the Sheriff's four beautiful
children at the Lady Mayoress's Fancy Dress Ball, which, for certain
domestic reasons, my wife was unable to attend. Of course I
answered somewhat hastily and sarcastically—who would not, under

suoh provocation P—and hack oomes such a formal acknowledgment,
and suoh ample expressions of regret at having troubled me, that I
was occupied next day for hours in endeavouring to soothe her
wounded feelings, and, I fear, in vain. I have lately had to enlarge
my overburdened letter-box, and the weary Postman asked and
obtained an extra Christmas-box for his additional labours on my
behalf, and nearly the whole of it caused by such idiotio, or drivel-
ling, or gushing rubbish as makes me ashamed of my race! C. C.
Sib,—I am a Public man—a Secretary to an important Public
Company. My Board meet bi-weekly, and my first duty is to read
the letters. They are numerous, and important, and require imme-
diate attention. The time dedicated to that diffioult task constitutes
the plague and the terror of my otherwise very endurable existence.
I am naturally of a very sensitive nature, and a word of irony or
sarcasm seems at onoe to deprive me of the use of my ordinarily good
faculties. Our Chairman is a keen, sarcastic, loud-voiced, busy
man, to whom every hour is of pecuniary importance. The tray full
of letters is placed before me, and my hour of agony begins. And
why? Because of the shameful and utterly illegible scrawl in
whioh many of them are written. AVhen I arrive at one of these, I
feel I am gradually losing my presence of mind, and, after one or
two bad guesses, I find myself in wandering mazes lost. Why, there
are some signatures to letters of importance that defy not only me.
but even the Chairman, and every Member of the Board to deoipher!
Fancy a letter apparently with this signature, John Ileyhwogbts.
If I make a guess, more or less shrewd, at the name, and com-
mence the letter, at my first break-down the sarcastic Chairman
bids me spell the word, or else skip and go on, or, as a final degrada-
tion, to pass it round, and begin another, with possibly the same
result. I remember on one occasion the Chairman, being much
pressed for time, was urging me on in my wild career, when, from a
fearfully-written letter, I read aloud as follows:—" The goods safe
to hand, but, the lard cracking, caused a leakage." A shout of
laughter ensued, which was repeated when the Chairman read out:
"But the bad packing caused a breakage." Ever since then, when-
ever I hesitate, some booby kindly suggests that it may be the
"cracking lard "—and I blush with anger. Oh, Gentlemen, Gentle-
men, write as you please on other matters, but, when writing on
business, pray write plainly, and earn the eternal gratitude of
thousands of puzzled officials. E. B.
Sib,—What are we coming to as regards Correspondence? Is
legible writing to be considered one of the lost Arts, like Soulpture
or Stained Glass P I am, I am proud to say, looked upon as a
Philanthropist, that is to say that, having abundant means and no
expensive vioes, I indulge myself m the luxury of doing good. It
gives me but little trouble. What I give away is a superfluity that
I can well spare, and my oharacter for benevolence enables me to
move among my fellow-men with that feeling of superiority, and
that look of supreme self-satisfaction, so gratifying to the soul of a
true Philanthropist. I read with rapture the glowing terms of
admiration with whioh I am addressed by the needy crowd of appli-
cants for my bounty, my one grievance being the almost illegible
handwriting in whioh they are sometimes expressed. To such an
extent does this prevail, that I have almost resolved in future to
consign such effusions to the waste-paper basket without any attempt
to deoipher them, but then who can tell what sad cases I might
neglect, or what rapturous effusions of gratitude I might lose I
Some two years ago I purohased the very largest Album that
money could prooure, and I out out from the numberless letters I
receive all the warm effusions and rapturous appellations, and the
almost reverential expressions that flow so abundantly in response to
bank-notes or cheques, in token of almost abject gratitude for favours
received, and, possibly, for more to oome, and these I carefully insert
in my " Album of Gratitude," as I have rather prettily named it,
and which forms a rather striking feature on my drawing-room table,
and to the perusal of which I dedicate many leisure hours. I should
like, if you can afford me room, to give you a specimen of what I
have to endure in endeavouring to read applications from Ladies,
but if not, my remonstranoe may still be productive of some good to
myself and my brother philanthropists. From obvious motives I
deoline to sign my name.
Specimen.
Highly Honoured Sib,
Knowing your symphony is a very good work, I appeal to
your highness with security that I may add a trophy to help me to
publish it at home for that most malignant and overclouded race
neither in laoe, when they expend their ruminating, fearful days,
far from the worry of indigestion, born of misguided Samaritans and
of muslin daughters, &o., &o.
Who could have believed that this proved to be an appeal to my
sympathy on behalf of an Institution for the maligned and mis-
understood race of Mothers-in-law, where they might spend their
remaining peaoeful days free from the worry and ill-disguised scorn
of misjudging Sons-in-law, and of misled Daughters?

"How many r" roughly he replied;
"Why don't you look and see '<"
"But where is room? I see no room?"
My wrath I tried to smother.
He answered—" On one side are six,
And only .five on t'other."
"Two of the five," I pointed out,
"Must weigh a ton between 'em;
Two others have such tattered garbs
As barely serve to screen 'em."
Then did the little " Cad " rejoin,

INTERIORS AND EXTERIORS. No. 7.

THEATRICAL CELEBRITIES MEET FOR A BENEFIT.
ON THE EIGHT LINE?
The encouraging news that already six complete miles of the
Suakim-Berber Railway had been actually laid, and the first station
at Handonb reached under the protection of only 10,000 troops, all
the while well on the alert against surprise, naturally has had a
favourable effect on the Preference Shares, and the first week's
passenger and traffic receipts are being looked forward to with muoh
hopeful anxiety. As, however, our old friend Osman Digna is said
for the last few days to have been seen hanging about an advanced
signal-box with 3,000 followers, and manifesting a lively interest in
the progress of the undertaking, it is hardly reasonable that the
speculating public should look for a very large dividend in the earlier
days of the working of the line.
It is calculated that with three or four batteries of artillery well
placed on the roofs of the carriages, one Parliamentary train, that
will be timed to stop at every telegraph-post, may be got through in
the day, though the opinion is freely expressed that when the line
finally reaches Berber, a well-organised British army of 150,000 men
will be all that will be required to insure a fairly steady service
between the two termini. It may be added that, owing to a certain
amount of hazard being involved in any travelling at the present
moment, the Company notify that Return Tickets, in the event of
any difficulties at Handoub, will be available either by captured
* or flying squadron of the enemy's cavalry.

TENDER, IF TRUE.
In a recent advertisement announcing that they are willing to
receive Tenders from persons who may be desirous of contracting
for the removal of some portion of St. Mary's Churchyard, required
for the widening of Upper Street, Islington, the Metropolitan Board
of Works, through their Clerk, Mr. J. E. Wakefield, furthermore
add that the printed forms, supplied by the Board, are to be enolosed
in sealed covers and endorsed "Tender for Removal of Human
Remains." This is practical and businesslike, no doubt, bnt it is
nevertheless sufficiently ghastly to suggest that, however muoh the
ratepayers of Islington, many of whom are presumably related to
the dead lying in the threatened churchyard, have reason to be
satisfied with the contract made on their behalf by the Board, they
can scarcely regard the consideration that spirited body has shown
for their feelings, as remarkably Tender.

QUITE THE WRONG MAN.
(Our Own Condensed Shilling Dreadful.)
Chapter V.—Behind the Scenes.

Accustomed as he was to the lux-
urious appointments of the "Bowery,"
and other resorts of the Transatlantic
Thespis, O'Dwyeb was somewhat
ohilled (in spite of the heat of the
weather) by the austere severity of
our English appointments. His host,
however, led the way with a nobility
of manner which can only be acquired
at Courts, and with a majestic defer-
ence in word and actions which some-
what amazed O'Dwyer, though he
had persuaded himself that his merits
as a Novelist, Critic, and Poet, were
being recognised by English Society.
Thus O'Dwyer plumed himself as
from one Lobby he passed into another,
and again into a third, all with crum-
bling whitewash on the walls,
i "Here, at^last, we are!" exclaimed
his guide, half raising a'heavy curtain, and beckoning O'Dwyeb to
advance. The Novehstfstooped to enter below the curtain, when,
suddenly, the gas went out, he was propelled from behind by a foot,
applied with prodigious vigour, and, as he stumbled forward, his
head and shoulders were enveloped in a black bag.
Keen narootic fumes mounted to his dizzy brain. As he swooned
he heard his late companion's voice, strangely altered, exclaim,
"Ye spalpeen, we 've bagged ye at last!" Then, in silvery tones, a
Lady cried, "Prince Flobizel,* of Bohemia, is our captive."
• • * • • •
Ten minutes later, six men, disguised as " supers" and carpenters,
carried a long and heavy package to a cart that had been drawn up
at the stage-door of the Mausoleum.
A man sprang on the seat, and the cart drove rapidly away.
Chapter VI.—The Cabinet Meeting.
Next morning a meeting of the Cabinet, at an extremely early
hour, was held in the Premier's official residence. Though nothing
more than usual had appeared in the newspapers to alarm the
Publio, the countenance of every British Minister present evinced,
in an even unusual degree, the emotions of terror and alarm.
"Dynamite is nothing—nothing to this daring brigandage in our
very midst," said one unhappy tenant of office.
Prince Florizel disappeared, lost from the heart of our very
capital," exclaimed another.
"That means a quarrel with Bohemia at once," groaned the
representative of the Admiralty, "and, with our phantom navy,
how are we to send a fleet to 'a desert country near the sea.'"
"You are sure the Prinoe is missing '<" said a noble Lord, eagerly.
"Not a sign of him anywhere since the day before yesterday,
exoept that he was seen, last night, at the Mausoleum, with a
Stranger."
"I always told you the Mausoleum was a Fenian man-trap," said
the Home Secretary, with a groan. At that moment a three-cornered
pink note was suddenly materialised, and appeared in mid-air,
whence fluttering, it fell on the table.
"They have Mahatmas among them," whispered one wan Minister,
deeply read in Esoteric Buddhism. "Madame Bluewitchsky is in
the conspiracy."
• By kyind permisiion of Mr. R. L. Stevenson.
The note was opened, and contained these dreadful words:—
'' A trusty Messenger (must be a Cabinet Minister) wanted. Will be
treated with at Z. 33, The Albany to-day. Any attempt to employ
Police will result in boiling oil for interesting captive."
(Signed) Dynamite Death's Head.
Lots were hastily made, thrown into a hat, and drawn. The
unlucky Minister (quite young) on whom the lot fell, set out at once,
with Banknotes for five milliards, and the Concession of a Republic
for Ireland, in his pocket. At hazard of war with Bohemia, Prince
Florizel must be ransomed at any price.
Chapter "VII.—The Fenians' Den.
In luxuriously furnished rooms (Z 33, The Albany) three men,
dressed in rose, saffron, and peach-bloom velvet smoking-suiU,
embroidered with monograms in the precious metals, were smoking
cigarettes and drinking Kiimmel out of foaming silver beakers.
A low moan from a captive beneath a Chippendale sideboard, alone
broke, now and again, the calm of the festive gathering. The talk
was of women and of horses. Three hasty knocks and a low whistle
were heard at the door. "Let him in, Jack," said the eldest of the
party, " 'tis the Envoy from the Cabinet."
Taking up a diamond-studded revolver in his taper fingers, the
youth addressed as " Jack" opened the door.
"Come in!" he was heard to say, in a hearty tone, as if recognising
an acquaintance, "glad they've sent you. Have you a good thing
for the Two Thousand?" The Minister who entered had the air of
a man in good society. After shaking hands with the Conspirators,
whom he nad often met, as he eaid, in happier circumstances, at
Ascot and Newmarket, he took his seat and a cigarette.
"You are prepared to treat?" asked the Chief.
"Yes, five miUiards,
money down, and a Republio for Ireland;
also a Fleet as soon as Brassey can get it built."
"You can't say fairer," answered the Fenian. "Between gentle-
men business is soon over. Now, Jack, release and ungag His Royal
Highness." Jack undid the ropes which fastened a stick between the
arms and legs of the prisoner under the sideboard, who was trussed
like a fowl. Then he raised him, and dragged to the light no
Prince, but William Van Donop O'Dwteb. All rose respectfully.
"I am sorry, Gentlemen," said the Minister, somewhat hastily
replaoing his Banknotes and the Concession in his pocket, "that this
is a oase of mistaken identity. You have been deceived by a very
remarkable resemblance, but this gentleman is not Prinoe Florizel,
of Bohemia. I do not even know who he is. I wish you good day."
He bowed, and was gone.
Chapter VIII.—Free I
The Fenian Chief, in whom O'Dwyer now recognised the polite
Stranger, advanced with stately steps to his trembling oaptive.
"Sir," he said, "you know too much. Your present position 13
more your misfortune than your fault, to be sure; but your con-
tinued existence would be prejudicial to the fortunes of the cause.
You must oblige by showing how a brave man can die!"
Jack trifled with the revolver.
"First, I fear I must have you searched," the Chief went on.
"Search him, Jack!" O'Dwyer offered no resistance. Jack drew
from his pocket the gold-bound note-book, with the crest of the
O'Dwyebs in blue enamel.
"My own family cognisance," said the Chief. "This is curious—
and affecting," he added, seeing the name of William Van Donop
O'Dwyer on the first page. "And what," he went on, with trem-
bling eagerness, "is this t"
Then he read aloud the notes which, before starting for Europe,
O'Dwyeb had made of a plot for his new sensational NoveL Here
are a few of them:—
"Disguised as Grand Old Man, blow up Windsor Castle."
"Let Macdebmott carry off Princess Althea to Zanzibar."
"Poison Bishop of London at Tea-meeting of Friendly Girls'
Society."
"Why, my very dear Sir," the polished Brigand exclaimed,
turning to his prisoner, "my dear Mr. O'Dwteb, you are one of us i
Why did you not explain all this before? Ah, I remember; the gag.
What a pity; but the laws of the game, are the laws of the game!
How am I to apologise for this most inconvenient occurrence? Such
a very remarkable likeness between you and Prince Florizel, whom
we designed to kidnap. Your schemes," he added, returning the
note-book, "do you infinite oredit, but are beyond the scope of
merely private enterprise. Let us meet to-morrow, and discuss
them. But you must be loDging for the comforts of your hotel.
Jack, call a Hansom for Mr. O'Dwteb."
Once more, but more happily, the Novelist was taken for Quite
the Wrong Man!—for a Fenian this time!
In five minutes O'Dwyeb was free. In fifty he was speeding to
Liverpool, on his way back to New York. He is determined to
return, as before, to domestio American manners, and to carefully-
seleoted uneventful incidents. He has had enough of adventurous
| Romance.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
MY FIRST APPEARANCE IN A DIABOLICAL CHARACTER.
"Please, Sir," said my admirable and excellent Clerk, "Mr.
Blackstone Smith's compliments, and as he is obliged to go on
Circuit, will you kindly look after Hare versus Lambkin for him P"
I was more than gratified. This was the first time anyone had
sufficiently appreciated my talent to entrust me (in a representative
character) with a Brief. It was a grand opening. I felt that once
get a footing even as the "devil" of another, my fortune was made.
My cheeks flushed with pleasure, and I determined to conduot my
case so admirably that my friend should never regret the confidence,
the great confidence, he had reposed in me.
My first care was to exercise myself in oratory. Curious to say,
that although enjoying, as I have hinted, a not unsatisfactory
practice, I had never yet addressed either a Judge or Jury. I thought
at first of rehearsing my eloquence in the presence of my exoellent
and admirable Clerk, but as that estimable individual has a more
than usually keen sense of the ridioulous, I abandoned the intention
in favour of another audienoe.
In that Division, to whioh I have alluded on more than one occasion
as the Court of my Hearth and Home, I had frequently been called

The Court of Hearth and Home (Nursery Division).
upon for a defence—I determined to turn this domestio tribunal to
account. Thus, on the next occasion I was charged, on returning
from my Chambers at 7.30, with " negligence" in forgetting to bring
back the current day's dinner (I had undertaken to convey home in
my brief-bag some salmon, a chicken, and three pounds of Store
sausages), I hastily assumed an old wig, and empanneling my infant
sons as a jury, addressed their mother in impassioned accents as my
judge. For a moment so strong was my imagination, that the family
entirely disappeared, giving place to a Division in the High Court.
It was only upon Justy (an abbreviation for the name of my eldest
son Justinian) beginning to giggle, and consequently being imme-
diately sentenced to three days seolusion on a no-pudding-for-dinner
diet, that I was recalled to myself. I may here say that I am very
strict in extorting respeot from my children—I am bringing up all
my sons as Solicitors, so that in the days to oome they may supply
me with additions to my practice. This is so well understood
amongst them, that it has long been the ambition of their bright
young lives to " give dear Papa his Maiden Brief." After this, my
appearance in the Court of my Hearth and Home was of frequent
ooourrenoe. Although I regret to say that my Wife refused to
preside, on the score that it was " so silly."
It was well that I had made these preparations, for on one
memorable morning my excellent and admirable Clerk handed to me
a paper, endorsed with the name of my absent friend and instructing
him to move at once for the appointment of a Receiver in Hare
versus Lambkin. As representative of Blackstone Smith, I assumed
a deportment suggestive of dignity and responsibility, and hastened
to the Robing Room, near Carey Street. It was one of the proudest
moments of my life when I assumed my wig, bands, and gown,
conscious that, instead of the morning paper, encased in a half-
sheet of foolscap, I was going to carry into Court a real brief. As I
passed through the corridors, it struck me that many a Q.C. regarded
me with respectful apprehension as if they recognised in my grave,
determined person a rapidly arriving rival for forensio honours.
Passing by the doorkeeper of the Court, with a confidence that a
bitter enemy might have described as swagger, I found myself in
the presence of the Division. My heart went out proudly to the
entire Bar, and in his Lordship on the Benoh I recognised one with
whom I was about to enter into a oloser professional relationship.
It was at this point that I looked round to meet my client—the
gentleman who was going to instruct me. I was a little disap-
pointed to discover that the head of the firm, instead of coming him-
self, had sent a legal phenomenon in the shape of an extremely
junior Clerk, of very tender years, to represent him. However, this
learned boy soon convinced me that, in spite of his budding youth,
his knowledge of the intricacies of the profession with which ne was
connected was infinitely greater than I could boast: that, in fact, to
put it colloquially, he had more law in his little finger than I pos-
sessed in my whole body.
Soon after making this rather embarrassing discovery, I was
accosted by the Counsel on the other side with a view to a com-
promise. Up to this moment I (representing the Plaintiff) had
considered my conduot irreproachable—that I certainly could have
insisted upon oeing received by the most oensorious as the pattern of
all the virtues. To my intense surprise, after listening to my oppo-
nent's arguments, I found myself (again in my representative
capacity) admitting all my faults, and willing to make any possible
compromise. I appealed to the legal phenomenon for instructions,
when the learned Doy sternly reminded me that I (as representing
the Plaintiff) was the most injured of persons, and that any sur-
render was out of the question.
"Well, then," said my opposing friend, the Counsel on the other
side, "all we can do is to go in and fight it out. If we don't, they
will pass us in the list."
With this he left the corridor in whioh we had been holding our
consultation, and entered the Court. I was about to follow nim,
when I was stopped by a barrister-friend of mine, who (strange
to say) seemed amazed to see me holding a brief. To impress upon
his mind that it was genuine, and not a dummy, I thought it advis-
able to give him a short sketch of the case. After my narrative had
consumed tome ten minutes, it suddenly occurred to me that the
Court might be waiting to hear me move. I looked round for the
legal phenomenon, the learned lad he had vanished! I hurried
into Court, and took my place in the Barrister's seats.
"Have they come to Hare versus Lambkin t" I whispered to a
young Barrister, who was busily engaged in sketching a fancy
portrait of the Mahdi upon a piece of blotting-paper.
"Must have," he replied. They are in the middle of the Divorce
Motions."
Got into the middle of the Divorce Motions! Oh horror! I had
been passed over!
"What shall I do ¥" I asked, in deep distress, as the f aot in all its
naked hideousness became clearer and clearer. Had I not been
restrained by etiquette, I should have wept like a ohild!
"Better address the Court the moment the next motion is disposed
of," replied the artistio Barrister. "Perhaps you will get it restored."
Following this advice, I rose to my feet with desperate courage.
Then it was that I felt that my knees were made on the self-folding-
up principle, and that my voice, after shouting out in stentorian
tones, "My Lord I " to the astonishment of all beholders, had assumed
the oharaoter of a husky and chronio whisper.
My unearthly howl (which surprised me as much as anyone else in
Court) caused a deathly silence to prevail. His Lordship, at first a
little startled, turned to me courteously and bowed, as if inviting
any further communication I might wish to make to him. My
knees gave way more than ever, and I became cold and hot by turns,
then in the second stage of my voice—the unearthly husky whisper—
I gasped out—
"My Lord, may it please your Lordship, the faot is, my Lord"
At this moment I stopped for very shame, for I could not help
feeling that this insistanoe upon the Judge's official title (which
seemed to be caused by some power over which I had no control) was
absolutely abject in its fawning meanness.
The Judge good-naturedly bowed, and waited for more. I opened
my mouth, but could not make it speak.
"May it please your Lordship," I heard a cheery voice say,
speaking rapidly in crisp, clear, and self-assertive syllables, " but I
think my friend is labouring under a mistake. He was kind enough
to say that he would appear for me to make a motion, that your
Lordship has already disposed of, were I absent. I, however, got
back in time to appear myself, and until this moment, had no means
of commnnioating with him."
It was too true; Blackstone Smith had suddenly returned, and
my chance of distinguishing myself as his "devil" had vanished for
ever! A. Briefless, Junior.
Singular Synonyms.—By aocounts from Aix-les-Bains, Her

KHAN OR CAN'T?
{Two Extracts from an Ameer's Diary.)
Rawul Pindi, April, 1302.
Allah be praised! Though I began htre by putting on, by
mistake, one of the fire Ruski uniforms sent me with a ton of
dynamite, on my last birthday, by the insupportable Rhinoceros of
the North, the Moscow Czar, yet no one seemed to mind it, and I
was not, as would have been only natural under the circumstances,
treacherously flayed alive. No—I have had, after all, a glorious
time of it with these " Infidel English Dogs"—that is, I mean with
these "White British Brothers of the After-dinner Moon," as I
called them, I believe, in my speech at the Banquet, when the
laughing Rajah Duffebin presented me with those six dozen pink
satin Dressing Gowns, that Battery of Naval Horse Artillery,
together with the Dessert Service and an explosive Mechanical Piano.
Yes, everything has gone off beautifully. That smooth-tongued
Hyfena of Tiflis, Mubza Yakoob Blog, was quite wrong when he
said that the King of Connaught had come by the command of the
Empress, in disguise, all the way from All-der-shut, to put poison
into the ooffee at the Durbar, when the seven hundred and ninety-
two spies I brought with me were not looking. No; I am sure he
did nothing of the kind, and I found him, as the Interpreter said he
had explained to him, a most nice-spoken young man." Yet am I
not altogether at peace.
Last night did I sit up with the Rajah Duffebin till the East
grew grey with the coming dawn, trying, over a bowl of the excel-
lent spiced and steaming pledge-drink, styled El-Rhum-Punch, the
sacred beverage, as I have since learned, that wisely accompanies the
making of all treaties in the West, to draw straight frontier lines on
several new Maps, with a burnt soda-water cork. I did, too, as the
Treaty-drink went round, pledge myself to much. To how much, I
know not 1 What matters. Kismet.' We shall perhaps see as time
goes on. To bed reflective.
Ha! But here is the merry Rajah-Viceroy oome round to wish
me "the top of the morning," and present to me, as a parting
gift at the Station, two hundred Emerald-Green Bathing-Machines, a
ton of Huntley and Palmer's biscuits, 12,000 stand of arms, an
Iron-plated Railway Omnibus, with conductor complete, and the "Star
of India" in dazzling imitation. "Have I ache in the head r" No.
And "Do I still adhere to the signatures and undertakings of the pre-
vious eveningF" As he inquires, he says he will just throw into the
present, as a finish, two dozen performing Elephants and five hundred
tons of very superior gunpowder, and at the same time pay for my
ticket. My answer is a dance of ioy upon the platform. The Rajah
Duffebin seems amused. So do the dear Infidel English Dogs. Allah
be praised! A good deal to pay for extra luggage, but off at last!

Perhaps the great over-feeding at the Durbar is responsible, per-

light mantle of the Order of the Indian Star, given me by the
humorous Rajah Dog, Duffebin, may be the cause,—perhaps some
El-Rhum-Punch of my own make—who knows? but I am seized
with much melancholy. Unwelcome news from the frontier, it may
be P The Council of Elders (may the tightest boots of Mahomet be
upon them for a fortnight 1) growl curses at me, and put their hands

done. What have I done P I give them the two hundred Emerald-
Green Bathing-Machines, but they are not appeased. Is it that in
my absence the Ruski Hyesnas of the North have seized on lands and
marshes and places with odd names P No: for, by the Prophet, I
was not aware I possessed them. Alas 1 that I have never learned
the geography of my native country 1 Where, I wonder, did I really
draw those frontier-lines with burnt soda-water cork P Too much

Mb. Cotven's Scandinavian Symphony has been received in Paris
at the Winter Circus with enthusiasm. The Parisians could not
realise that they were listening to
the work of an English Composer.
An appropriate subjeot and tho-
roughly English for Mr. Cowrn

if names go for anything. Our
Native Composers are beginning
to look up. I congratulate Mr.

have made a holiday in Paris just
to hear the performance of his
composition, and there would have
been plenty of time to spare for
other business as well.
Mr. Srsis's Latt Chance at the

the whole lightened with bright,

the Author for using old materials.

marvellous. Meohanism in a realistic drama up to a certain point?
—Yes. But beyond that, it destroys all illusion. Mechanical change
of scene in fairy pieces, pantomimes, and extravaganzas assist the
illusion. Once introduce the supernatural motive, everything is
possible, and nothing is improbable except probability; but as we do
expect this in a melodrama of real life, the less of magical changes
of scene in such a piece the better.

of a mechanically-worked melodrama, all wheels and whistling.
Every change of scene necessitates a momentary lark siance, as at
Maskelyne and Cooke's, with not half so satisfactory a result,
during which cab-whistles
are blown violently, then
there are strange rumbling

emerge into a twilight, then

lights are turned full on, and
we see what we do see, which
is first-rate of its kind.

but through whose fault I don't know, not having been present at
the accident.
To end, as I began, with music. Cart. Rosa deserves all the
support he gets, and as much as Opera-lovers can give him. But a
few years ago, just at this time of year, the Italian Opera season
would have been commencing, and the new prima donna or tenor
would have been the "talk of the town;" and twenty years ago it
would have been the fashionable thing to have taken your stall for
the season, and to have possessed a " bone," which when you were
not going to use it would l>e a bone of contention among your poorer
friends. What a useful thing, was " a bone "! It insured so much
attention, such politeness, so many dinners, so many invitations!
And now you may have your pockets full of Opera bones, and yon
are of no more account than if they were free passes to the British
Museum.
But Carl Rosa has worked for years to keep the Sacred Lamp of
Opera alive in town and country. Last Thursday he brought out
Goring Thomas's Nadeshda, which achieved a well-merited suooess.
I have only time to say now that the Second Act is the finest, but
the duet in the Third is the gem of the Opera, and a beautifully set
gem too. Madame Alwtna Vai.lkria and Mr. McGcckin acted and
sang admirably. Goring Thomas has come out splendidly, and, on
being called after the Second Aot, he came out, before the Curtain,
more splendidly than ever. Full particulars'

Perhaps H.R.H the Prince of "Wales will next take under con-

WALES IN IRELAND.
(Our Own Extra Special Correspondent in the Sunny South.)
Monday.—A day made memorable by the prisintation av new
colours to the gallant Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, by
the divartin' eccentrocities av the Lord Mayor of Dublin, who was
left out in the could, an' by the Prince's good-bye. Conoarnin' these
in due order.
The re-colourin' av the regiment was beautifully executed. It
seems that long ago these famous warriors had all been coloured with
a coat av red, however knockin' and fightin' about the world from
Flanders to Egypt for 180 years had. knocked the paint off thim.
May be the ginerals were careless about puttin' the red soldiers back
in their little box whin they were done playin' with them, or left
them out in the rain,—anyhow, they got paler an pinker as the years
rolled on, till at last they were well an' honourably known as the
Light Infantry. Before they were re-coloured. Colonel Stabd (an' I
suppose. Majors Cut an' Thrust), had them all properly " drawn up
in line, an an iligant drawin' it was—with all the lines straight.
The Illustrious Field Marshal made them a speech, puttin' in a nice
little touch here an' there, and thin prisinted ivery man with a new
box av colours, containin' cakes av war-paint specially manufactured
for the occasion. They took the colours well, and were marched off
to dry in the sun.
Meanwhile the Lord Mayor was in disperation: the Nationalist
boys laughin' at him, the Royal Loyalists laughin at him, internal
dissensions and divils of discord annovin' the poor man all day, an'
Night-Mares, ohiefly of a breed called "broken Baro-Nite Mayors,"
disturbin' him o' nights, and now at the end av the week (after he
had passed his solemn Corporate word to me that he wouldn't raise a
finger on the Prince, but let him go in peace), for the boys to turn on
him on the very steps of the City Hall! In vain he rushed to the
balcony, wearin' his gold collar av 88., and lookin' as if he'd like to
collar the other hisses in the jeerin' crowd below.
•" I '11—I '11—yis, I 'U tell Parnell on ye; so I will; an' I '11 tele-
graft to Cork and Mallow, and—Boo 1—oo—oo!" He wept, an' was
finally led away and comforted by Tim Sullivan, an' that was the
last seen or heard av the eccentrocities an' atrotrioities* av the Head
av the Corporate body. After that we left, an' the "good-bye
sweet-hearty" cheers mingled with the loud " O-revoir, O'Roonet!"
as we swept up the streets to Kingsbridge (an operation by the way
thim same streets would be the better av occasionally).
Mallow.—Did well with the Equerry ong root. He has written
for a new Cheque-book. Tould him, at intervals, to look at the
scenery. "Hang the scenery," sez he. "I 'd sooner see the aoe av
hearts"—which shows what an anaesthetic, sleepy sort he was.
Besides, he ought to have known by this time that, in the noble
game av " Spoil Five," I enjoy an exclusive monopoly av that inte-
restin' card.
At the Station, Mr. O'Brien, determined to avenge the in-
sult put on the Lord Mayor, had gathered together sivin brass
bands, an' other bands of another sort, to assist in the brayin'.
However, the brave Mr. Cooke, the Director av the Company, was
not disposed to allow an English gintleman to form a bad opinion av
Irish insthrumental music, and bundled thim same bands out av the

he was invested with the noble Order av " the Eccentric Chuck," an'
one Cooke spoiled that broth av a boy, and the plans av the other
boys—for this time, anyhow.
We heard the distant strains av a song as we steamed up,
an' at first no one dared to tell the Illustrious what it was till 1
myself makes bould to say, "Sir, that's 4 Ood Savt Ireland.'"
Me frind the Equerry was goin' to cut me head off (I suspect he
thought it would be a new way to pay old debts), but the Prince
stopped him. "It's a fine sintimint, Mr. O'Roonet," sez he, "to
thim as understands it aright." An' maybe I '11 say it meself some
day; and the rest av the Staff was silent, an' amazed.
Tuesday.—To Convanmore, Lismore, Curraghmore, and many
more places. "The More the merrier " was our motto.
Wednesday.—Cork,—where again we heard the Nationalist tune,
and it didn't seem to annoy the Prince a bit, but he hummed it softly
to himself, an' smiled. An' then the full flowin' vintage av' the grand
vin av' our reception wasn't " corked" a wee bit, as Mr. Pabnell,
anxious to avenge the Lord Mayor av1 Dublin, had fondly hoped.
No, Sir, the weather was extra dry, and the wine av welcome extra
Superior, barrin' the grunts of a few hungry sans-cutletts that was
drowned in the cheers av the prosperous well-fed majority.
Sir Daniel O'Sullivan kept order like a very DANiELoome to
judgment in a Lions' Den, and the pretty Cork girls, those at least
who didn't disfigure their faces with frowns, showered welcomes on
us in that soft musical brogue av theirs that goes up an' down in
delicate semitones av captivatin' chromatics! We visited the School
av Art, saw the Milesian Venus, an Irish Oirl, with no arms to speak
of—p'raps she had hugged them off with delight at our arrival, and
played Elgin marbles with Mr. Brennan, the head-master, an' after
a look at the lace— Odds! Snowllakes and Gossamers! but it must
have been woven by fairies!—we studied "Still Life." That took
us some time, an' the Equerry an I found great difficulty in leavin'
the same still. I send you a jar of '74 Potheen Brut in token av me
affection, and in memory of the studies from " the Still."*
We are now Birds av Passage. Laid the keel av a new tank
ship—after which I sang " Weel may the Keel row,"—with the
"Tic-i-tank" chorus from Trial by Jury—and then across "the
glorious water av the river Lee'' to Haulbowline—and there in
prisiDce av all the quality av the Sunny South, an' five hundred
citizens of renown—(a real good Munster muster—or as me sportin'
friends called them a Munster " monkey ") the Prince made the best
speech iver came from wise Royal lips. I'm not in the Long Bow
line now, mind you.t an' I tell you that the tables was fairly turned
on the growlin' and howlin', Onashin'-alists, as the Illustrious sang
out, with a sincerity an' depth av feelin' that set all pulses gallopin
like racers, "Most fervently do I hope that it may please God
indeed to protect an' save Ireland." Nivir since the days when
Garibaldi an' I won the battle av Spezzia, no, not when I jined
the other Ginerals after Waterloo, can I mind so decisive a victory.
If ever the sister ship is indeed driftin' on the rocks an' reefs av
revolution, a strong pull like this disccorse from Haulbowline will
wear her off the danger, or me name 's not Tim O'Roonet!
Thursday.—Eillarney and Blarney with me Lord Ken ma re. Ross
Castle literally ruined itself in a grand effort to look picturesque,
an' the Lakes laughed with sunshiny smile*. Here after our triumph
we rest, and our aivarshions bein' av a private nature, I'm bound in
honour to keep them to meself. Maybe when you entertain me at
that banquet on me return, I '11 let you know more. Just now you
can't " Ken mair," as me Scotch cousins say.
Aunt Penelope would be glad av a copy av the paper, and the
Equerry would be 'bliged if you would kindly back the enclosed
three months for him.

Glass—With Care.—At the Middlesex Sessions last week, an
ingenious foreigner named Octavio Linati, aged, according to the
report, "seventy," and therefore old enough to know better, was
sentenced by the Assistant-Judge to six months' hard labour for
defrauding the Rev. Lord Archibald Douglas and others. He
represented himself as a Linati, and a Count. Inquiries showed
that he was not a Count, and that the noble Linati Family had not
the great honour of owning him as one of themselves. "His father,"
says the report, simply, was a glazier." Now, there is an anti-
quated species of chaff, still used in crowds, which consists in telling
a person who will obstruct somebody's view, that his father was
not a glazier, and therefore he isn't transparent." Many a true
word uttered in jest. LrjTAXr'fl father was a glazier; therefore he
could be, and, what is more, was seen through, and sentenced as
above mentioned. This is a warning to the sons of glaziers.

For inefficiency plus waste.

"I did not," replied Jkames; "but it might
have taken my outside skin off, had it caught
the bridge of my nose."
"An' what do the two skins off signify?"
asked Tim Ml-why.
"Nothing to me," answered Jeames.
"But a moighty dale to the Nationalists,"

LORD MAYOR OF LONDON.
Died, Dtranra hts Terw~of Office, April 11, 1885.
Death in the Civic Chair! A fate as hard
As little common. Churlishly debarred—
Bo sympathy is tempted to complain—
From the full glories of that golden reign,
Brief at its best, whioh guerdon is and goal
Of oivio worth. Yet had our life oontrol
Of its own issues, one might wish to die
On Honour's hill-top, in the noon-day's eye.
'Twas in the Hour of Honour that the dart
Struck him, unwarned, the man of cordial heart.
And Honour is of strong immortal breath,
Not to be cheeked by the chill hand of Death!
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Socmrr in London, written by "A Foreign Resident," and
published by Messrs. Chatto and Windus, is a very " chatty and
win as " sort of book. To all who have read Mr. Escott's England,
—and his England is everybody's England,—the Foreign Resident's
book will seem as if it were a supply of excellent material for whioh
Mr. Escott could not find room m the later portion of his com-
prehensive work,—not even in its most recent_ edition, which isj a
condensation, in form, since its first appearance in two volumes, and
an amplification, in matter, since its second appearance in one volume.
There is nothing of the Count Smorltork about the "Foreign
Resident." He "knows a deal," and knows how to tell it. Every-
body in London, or out of London, will rush for this book to see
what is going on everywhere; to see what is said about themselves,
and what is said about their friends, acquaintances, and "people
they have met." There is one class of persons our Distinguished
Foreigner never seems to have met in Society, and that is Musicians.
He has evidently an eye for everything that goes on, perhaps he has
no ear. Yet, certainly, in this volume, the Musician, be he or she
who he or she may, is conspicuous by his or her absence.
Finally the Foreign Resident, who does not seem to have set down
aught in malice, explains why duelling is not in vogue. This seems
unnecessary, as the book cannot offend anyone, and it would be
rather difficult to call out an anonymous Foreign Resident.
The Open Door and Old Lady Mary. By Mrs. Oliphant.
(Blackwood & Sons), are two of the most homely ghost stories we' ve
ever read since Charlks Dickens's Chimes. Most homely and most
natural: "creepy," of course, at first, but the creepiness wears off
until the reader becomes personally interested in the Ghosts' sorrows.
Part of the second story is told from the Ghost's point of view, and
it needs no other Ghost to give us further information about the
most awful of all "post-mortem examinations" as long as Mrs.
Oliphant's Ghost can tell us just as mueh as is sufficient to interest
us all. During the perusal of both stories, but especially in the
latter, Hamlets exclamation will often recur to the mind of the
reader, who will catch himself involuntarily sighing, "Alas, poor
Ghost!" and thinking how far worse off was Hamlets father than Old
Lady Mary, and how he seems to have made so much of his con-
dition merely for the sake of frightening his son, who, according to
tome among the best commentators, was only a raw schoolboy just
returned for the holidays, with an extra week granted on account of
his father's decease and the ascent of his usurping uncle to the
Throne of Denmark. But this is to travel out of the record.
Hamlets father's Ghost was a long-winded person, of a malevolent
and unchristian disposition, who revisited the glimpses of the moon
not to repair a wrong whioh he had committed, but to incite his son
to murder his uncle! The morality of Mrs. Oliphant's Ghosts is
far superior to this one of Suakspeahk's, and no one who is fond of
the mysterious should fail to peep in at the Open Door and to make
the acquaintance of Old Lady Mary.
Annals of the French Stage, by Frederick Hawkins (Chapman
axd Halls is an interesting and instructive work, written in a most
readable style. On some points, in the earlier portion of the work,
we should question the accuracy of his views of certain historical
matters, and it would be easy to point out where his narrative must
be " cautiously read," from its being inclined by a bias of which he
is not altogether unconscious. But from euoh faults what historian
is altogether free P One thing is made sufficiently dear by Mr.
Hawkins, that Dramatic Authors, Actors, and Managers are muoh
the same all over the world, no matter in; what age they live, or to
what country they belong. Authors cribbed from foreign dramatists,
from romancers, from poets, and from one another. The thefts were
excused and the work extolled when the thief was a genius, but if he
were not, then woe be to the appropriate)r of other men's ideas. The
French Actors began with devotion, lapsed into licence, and then
were astonished at not being treated as Christians, nor considered as
respectable oitizens. But in 1698 " social distinctions seemed to be
forgotten," and the foyer des artistes of the House of Moltebe was
the resort of the wit and fashion of the time. "Here," writes one
of the company, "the Actresses feel themselves in a measure forced
to adopt the tone of high rank, and to observe, above all, a strict
regard for decorum." Poor dears! But it must have been a bril-
Hant sight this foyer, equalled, perhaps, by the Green-Room of
Drury Lane on tie night when Macklin played Shyhck, and Mr.
Pope complimented him with his oelebrated couplet. We reoommend
Mr. Hawkins's Annals to all interested in histrionics.
A New Book of Sports (Bentley), written by various Saturday
Reviewists. Now, at last, we know their little games! But each
Sportive Reviewer still preserves his incognito, whioh seoresy iB
annoyingly but consistently mysterious. Don't let anyone abuse an
article in the Saturday^ or he may find that he has unwittingly
offended the young pugilistic Reviewer who does the boxing, and who
is evidently no amateur or theorist at fisticuffs; or he may have
outraged the feelings of another Reviewist who is a master of fence,
and who, if the offender will only come when he is " called out," will
leave his unfortunate opponent quivering on a daisy. The " Riding-
School " Essay is very amusing, as most Essays in this line are pretty
sure to be. Football " at the "Wall" recalls pleasant memories of
times when we ourselves were as much "shinned against as shinning,"
and often exclaimed, " 0 my prophetic soul, my Ankle!" How the
strongest went to the wall—he was generally put there, if we remem-
ber rightly—and how the weakest went down, and how infinitely
superior some of us considered football in the field!
But what a merry time they must have of it on a festival day at
the Saturday Review Office, when all the young men are gathered
together, including the Gentleman who is a practical authority on
the "Banjo and Bones," the two who are great at "Tops and
Marbles,"—nothing less than the Elgin Marbles, of course,—while
quietly in a comer will be seated a meditative pair engaged on
solving the permutations and combinations of " Knuoklebones " and
the mysterious symbolism of "Cat's-Cradle." For all these little
games, and many more, are treated of most amusingly in the New
Book of Sports.
"READY! AY READY!"
Or, More "Naval Intelligence " a la Mode.
Portsmouth.—The news that war had finally been declared
yesterday afternoon created, as might have been supposed, a stLU
further stir in every department in the Dookyard. It having, how-
ever, been discovered that the hulls of the nine unfinished quick-
sailing Cruisers, the designs for whioh were passed some seventeen
years ago, but have been mouldering quietly on the long-shore mud
ever since, cannot now be put into effective condition for going to sea
for the next two years and a half, the Authorities have lost no time
in jrarohasing all the available Coal-barges in the Outer Basin. These,
it is rumoured, are each to carry one of the new 1.1 inoh light breech-
loading guns, the patterns for which wiH be prepared some time early
next month, and as soon as everything is ready, and the Baltio
frozen up, as it is hoped it may be by next December, the whole
fleet wiU be dispatched there with sealed orders.
Plymouth.—The news that war had been declared was announced
here this morning by the sudden blowing up of the Arsenal, effected,
it is supposed, by the entry last evening of one or two of the enemy's
torpedo-boats, that must somehow have got past the Breakwater
without attracting the attention of the Policeman on duty. The
event has caused a good deal of annoyanoe and some surprise in
official circles, but it is now hoped that energetio measures will be
adopted to prevent the recurrence of the catastrophe.
Chatham.—The difficulty of manning the Boulogne Long Cheap-
Sea Route Steamers, just purchased by the Government, of the General
Steam Navigation Company, with a view to turning them into Iron-
clad Cruisers for service in the Black Sea, has at length been got
over. Effective orews have, it is understood, been rapidly recruited
from the local Omnibus-conductors and Cab-drivers, who, it is calcu-
lated, in their new uniforms, will look "ready for anything." It
may be added that great energy and activity prevail at the Admi-
ralty, where it has been decided that, in the event of it being proved
that the enormous sums spent annually on Her Majesty's Navy have
failed to provide a proper protection for the country, the matter will
be intrusted, as best it can, till further notice, to private enterprise,
as exemplified in the Mercantile Marine.
Alarming Intelligence.—A startling article appeared in the
Daily Telegraph the other day headed, "Arming the Liners." It is
to be hoped they wiU do nothing of the kind. Imagine being waited
upon by an Interviewer, with a revolver, and the abrupt demand of,
"Your Story or your Life!"

Morning Post, whioh actually printed it without note or comment:—
"Mr. W. H. Primrose, Private Secretary to Mr. Gladstone, produced the letter," &c.
The next thing will be for Mr. Gladstone to join "the Primrose League," and appear at

THE MAN WHO MENDED
THE BOILER.
"Mr. Benbow, the engineer of one of the
steamers in which the rescue of General Gordon
was attempted, arrived in London yesterday.
Mr. Benbow was engineer of the steamer on
which Lord Charles Beresford performed his
deeds of gallantry on the Upper Nile ; and among
his friends he is popularly known as 1 the Man
who Mended the Boiler.' He has come to this
country in response to an official telegram."
Air—" The Saucy Arethusa."
Come, all ye Rritons, brave and bold,
Whilst I his story do unfold—
(A better tale is seldom told)
The Man who Mended the Boiler!
An Engineer as deft as brave,
With a name that smacks of the salt sea
wave,
And a heart as staunch
As the hull of his launch;
And whenever Britons must meet the foe,
May they have suoh fellows as brave Bex-
botv,
The Man who Mended the Boiler!
'Twas with the Nile fleet he set out.
With Lord Charles Beresford, gay and
stout,
Midst the cataract's roar, and the Arabs'
shout,
The Man who Mended the Boiler.
Khartoum and Gordon ahead did lie,
When a plate in the boiler did start and fly,
With a puff and a crack,
And the pace did slack,
And the Arabs howled at that bang and
that puff,
But they knew not that handful of tars so
tough,
Nor the Man who Mended the Boiler!
Whilst the jubilant Arab3 did howl and
dance,
He surveyed the smash with a workman's
glance,
And saw at once that they couldn't
advance
With a big blank hole in the boiler.
Did he turn up the job like a muff ¥ Oh, no!
That wasn't the fashion of brave Benbow,
Midstream and still
He worked with a will
Through a dark Nile night and by morning's
light
He had patched up everything right and
tight
The Man who Mended the Boiler!
The Arabs looked from the sandy strand,
And thought that the Britons were brought
to a stand;
Bat those Britons they did not understand,
Nor the Man who Mended the Boiler.
Up steam once more! Midst a roar from
the shore.
Away up the Nile the steamer bore.
Let each brim a glass,
Whether lad or lass,
In a health to Lord Charles and his gallant
crew,
With a bumper to Benbow stout and true,
The Man who Mended the Boiler!

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FRO*
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 13.— Granville and the
Markiss joined hands to-night over bier of Lord Cairns. A truly
touching scene, showing political parties at their best. An exquisite
simplicity and tenderness about Lord Granville's speech, which he
modestly made but the introduction to the reading of letter from
Selborxe, himself bereaved. The Markiss not less happy because
not more affected. Coleridge's speech a little jarred on sensibilities
of the House, wrought up by what had gone before.
"An elegant oration," says stout Lord Bramwkll—" faultless in
diction, perfect in elocution, but reminds me (except in its absenoe
of passion) of those impromptu funeral orations delivered over the
graves of dead patriots in France, or the eulogy of a French Acade-
mician over the corpse of his predecessor."
Truly beautiful, but not sure if scene hadn't better have closed
with the rougher tones of the Markiss.
In Commons, Members gather in great gravity to learn whether
it's Peace or War. Members generally content to await statement
from Gladstone. Only Ashxead Bartlett insists upon associating
himself with crisis by putting questions he knows beforehand won't
be answered. Nor are they.
Gladstone does not say much, but manner means a great deal.
End not come yet. Still waiting, putting our trust in possibility of
satisfactory explanation, but keeping our powder dry.
Randolph emerges from Towers of Silence, and delivers speech on
affairs in the Soudan. This arises on Motion by Hartinoton,

approving calling out of the Reserves. Labbt thinks opportunity
convenient for protesting against the retention of forces in the
Soudan. Habtington and Gladstone both deprecate disoussion on
policy till Vote of Credit is brought on next week. But Randolph
got his speech ready, and not going to be put off by arguments of
that kind. "The policy of our large military operations in the
Soudan," he said, "has never yet been debated in this House," at
which Members visibly shuddered.
"Look here, Randolph, don't you know," said Sir Peel, "this is
rather going it. Here you've been gallivanting through India,
riding on elephants, and tiffining with Rajahs, whilst we've been
debating almost night after night, and from all points of view,
affairs in the Soudan. Then you come and coolly say the matter
hasn't been discussed, and that therefore you will open a debate
upon it! This is too muoh, even for me," and Sir Peel wagged
himself out of the House.
Pretty to see the Premier on going out to Division stop to shake
hands with Randolph.

Sweets to the Sweet."
"Dear me," said the young man, mopping the unbidden tear.
"How fond they all are of me, and how glad to see me back. I
wonder now how much they'd subscribe among them to get me off
on another tour?"
Business done.—Calling out of the Reserves approved. Progress
with Seats Bill.
Tuesday. — Sometimes complained that present raoe of Irish
Members devoid of national humour. A good deal in general state-
ment, but occasionally national character breaks through encasement
of dull mediocrity. So happened to-night. Parnellites mad at re-
ception of H.R.H. at Dublin. O'Brien determined that Mallow at
least shall do its duty. Goes down there with Harrington. Takes
crowd of roughs from Cork and bands of music. Proposes to take
possession of station, and howl at Prince and Princess when they
arrive. No disguise about this. O'Brien at least doesn't mince
matters; neither did the Mallow police. Bundled the lot out of
station, incidentally administering to Harrington what Bulwer with
extrajudicial air alludes to as " well-merited rap on the knuckles."
This afternoon Parnellites gather in ominous numbers. Parnell
rises, and before Speaker interposes, manages, in form of Question,
to charge Police with "brutal attack on the people of Mallow,"
(whom he accidentally mentioned had come from Cork with return-
tiokets). All this passed off very well. Parnell the very man
for situation. Never made a joke himself, nor saw one in any
situation. Irish Members all kept their countenances. Bulwer
spoiled the game first by inquiring in his solemnly prim manner,
whether it was true that Harrington had got "a wonner." But
cream of the joke skimmed by T. D. Sullivan, who, preserving his
gravity almost to the last word, affirmed that O'Brien, Harrington,
and the boys from Cork had gone down solely with view of serenading
His Royal Highness and the lovely Prinoess, and that the Police,
with unaccountable aversion to national music, chivied these inno-
cent lambs out of the Station to a distance, where their languishing
music might not strike on the Royal ear! This brought down the
House, and, amid roars of laughter, business was called on.
House pegging away in Committee on Seats Bill. 8ort of whole-
sale Christening Party; illimitable troops of infants in arms, repre-
senting newly carved-out Divisions, brought up. Dilke proposes to
name each in succession. On behalf of the family, local Member
suggests another name. A little friendly conversation. Name
decided on, infant christened; next one brought up; and so on to
the still distant end.
Business done.—Progress with Seats Bill in Committee.
Wednesday.—" Turn again, R. N. Fowler, twice Lord Mayor of
London, and let me congratulate you upon your re-election, and
felicitate the City upon its choioe."
"Ah, is that you, Toby? Thank you. You're very good.
Everybody's very good. Coleridge's bit of Latin this afternoon
very good, though unexpected. Might have given me notice, and
I'd have got up a little thing in Greek to give him back. Yes,
it's nioe thing to have been re-elected. But it's not all beer and
skittles at the Mansion House. A good deal of it's turtle. No one
but a Lord Mayor in October knows what a terrible thing turtle is.
You think not? That's all very well up to fifty plates in a year.
But when it comes to three hundred, turtle's trying. Only just
getting baok health after last year, and I'm in it again. But calls
of duty must be met, and I'm not tie man to shirk 'em."
Business done.—Christening Party still going on. Got a score or
so of fresh names distributed.
Thursday.—Too bad of McCoait so recklessly to hurt sensibilities
of Parnellites. It is well known that nothing is so foreign to then-
nature as " nnder cover of a Question to make a gross insinuation,"
whether against Member of the House, or otherwise. And here's
McCoan, in usual breathless style, wanting to know whether Messrs.
O'Brien, Harrington, O'Connor, and Dra6t. who went to Mallow
with avowed intention to insult the Prince of Wales, "are the same
persons who have sworn allegiance to the Queen, her heirs and
successors" P
The Parnellites bounded to their feet like one man. But Tim
Healt came to the front. In vain the Speaker, by strategic move-
ment, attempted to close incident by calling on Mr. James Campbell,
who had next Question on the paper. The Campbells were coming,
but Tim Hrait had come. In ordinary circumstances he would
have submitted to slightest indication of Speaker's desire. But
this outrage was too muoh. In vain the Speaker called on Camp-
bell; in vain Campbell, a peaceful retiring man, attempted to
strike in.
"I rise to order!" shouted Tim in that voice constructed to shake
Empires. Speaker at length gave in, and Tim, in voice trembling
. with emotion, continued:
"I ask you, Sir, whether it is admissible for the Hon. Gentleman
| under oover of a Question to make a gross insinuation of perjury
against Members of this House f"
The mere contemplation of such a thing was too much for honest
Tim, whose voioe, opening with a Btormy roar, closed in a tender
quaver. As for Joseph Gillis, tears tilled his gentle eyes. Plainly,
if this sort of thing were not checked, somebody would, "under
guise of a Question," be accusing Lord Spencer of murder, and
Treveltan of complicity in abominable crimes. CAllan, in the
excitement of the moment, found himself on his legs, incoherently
shouting " 8hame!" but subsided with great promptitude when he
found he had caught the Speaker's eye.
To some minds these emotionable outbursts will seem an inter-
ference with business. But they serve to raise the moral tone of the
House.
Grand Cboss brought forward amendment on Egvptian Loan Bill,
which Randolph kicked up and down floor of the House. Collapsed
at Eleven o'Clock, and Christening Party got to work again.
Stirring fight as to whether a certain district should be called
Penistone or Holmfirth.
"Sort of a Penistone or half-Penistone question," said Dilke,
impatiently. "Would go odd coin to settle it."
Would have been settled but for Fikth, who as usual got backs up
of Conservatives with well designed speech about Holmfirth.
"There's no Firth like Holm," said E. Clarke. "We are bound
to divide now." Which they did. Forget how question was settled.
Business done.—Grand Cross got a fall. More of Seats Bill.
Friday.—More of Ashmkad-Bartlett and the Scats Bill. Former
came on at Question time, as usual, the latter immediately after.
Christening Party now got over to Ireland, and is, naturally, a little
noisier. One of the infants coming to untimely end, Joseph Gillis

WALES IN IRELAND.
[Concluding Adventures of our Extra-Special Correspondent.)
As I write, everything: an' everybody, inolndin' the deck av cards
that was so useful to me, is paokin', and being packed up. I'm
busy revisin' the List of Honours and Titles that we mane to scatter
about before we go home; and 1 'm bothered bekase of some half
dozen "Garters" bein' missin' out av me Dispatch Box, and the
new Baronites an' Dukes all gettin' shuffled up just as I had sorted
thim. There is no more unreasonable wild-fowl than your brand-
new Baronite. However, here goes to wind up this immortal Dairy.
Monday.—Home by Limeriok, the Beautiful, as everybody
knows." Loyalties and Disaffectionists mixed up at Station. Some
av the latter very much mixed. Small scraps av black calico
flutterin' like the wings av dissipated Scarecrows, and sometimes
"the howlin's av Irish wolves," as a poetical an' play-aotin' ances-
tor av the Princess wanst oalled them, reaoh over eyes an' ears.
However, we know that it's only Mr. William O'BrrTER-BRTNE,
M.P., plaviu' his ugly tricks, and that his "wolves" are all
"hirelings."
Tuesday.—" Castles." Grand Review av Sunday Scholars an'
Scholaresses in the Park. "Wet day, and so the wee ones looked like
a lot of pious pinkeens as they laid their drenched devotion at our
feet After piety, Punohestown, an' after both, an' indeed durin'
both, the Deluge! Punohestown—a meetin' founded originally in
your own Honor's honour—turns out all slop, slush, slithers and
splash, an' no one, bar a mermaid or a water-baby, could enjoy it.
Even the Equerry was sad, an' I think it only right to tell you why.
He axed me to tell him something to back for the S wiminghome Cup,
an' I gave him a horse oalled Omadhaun, considerately layin'
agin' him myself to 'blige the Equerry. Fine start, an' they all do
well for the first five fathoms, Omadhaun gettin' off with a long
slow stroke, pullin' a dozen to the minute! I bid me friend observe
the solemn majestic stride with no vulgar hurry about it, peculiar to
the strain av all the Omadhaun breed. For all that the unraisonable
man looks flustrated as they come round the first time with
Omadhaun apparently ooverin' their retreat I Ye might cover them
with a table-cloth (if it had been about a quarter mile long). Now
they're lost behind the hill. Ha! they oome to the "double." See!
Pink has evidently a slidin' seat! Now they rise at it like trouts I
Three down! Three riderless steeds sailin' out into the weBt!
"Case of double and quits!" sez the Illustrious, with a cheerful
chuckle. Bidin'! Pullin'! Featherin' low! _ Flecked with foam!
Creepin' up to each other's girths, each horse with a bit in his mouth,
an' each Jockey with a bit in hand 1 Hooray! they sweep into the
straight. What's this? The oolours av the Equerry's fancy are
disvisible! At last we see him, swingin' along in stately fashion
three fields off!
"Why, he's nowhere, Mr. 0' Rooney !" sez the Equerry, shuttin'
up his glasses with a short snap; "an' I really must say that alto-
gether, and when you told me so distinctly, 'pon honour! don't you
know, it's hardly quite the"
What could I do but comfort the poor man? "Look at him,
Equerry," sez I, "isn't it beautiful? Blood of the Omadhauns, but
it s a great raoe! Sure, there he is, drivin' them all before him.'!"
Wednesday.—Now and for ever the Bridge that spans the wild
torrent av the tempestuous an' rushin' river Dodder is properly
christened. It is to be "Ball's Bridge," in memory of the finest
dance that ever Irishman stepped to since the days of Flanigan's
Ball. It would have done your eyes good to have seen Dick Martin
and Edward Guinness, footin' it bravely with Royalties as beoame
the leaders av six thousand saltatory citizens! It was late in the
evenin' before I jined in the Royal Jig, owin' to being obliged to take
part with Aunt Penelope and all the Heoabtts in the Mullingar
Minuet, but when I did shake a leg and sint a soul-stirrin' "Hoo!"
ringin' down the big barn (for that's what it was), the inthouseism
was just thremendous, so it was, as " Hey, diddle, diddle.'" played
big Mr. Liddell, and all the exalted party laughed to see such sport,
and applauded the deeds av O'Rooitey.
It was after that Aunt Penelope whispered to me that she wanted
to intbroduce me to Nobah Hegabtt. Norah was a soort av cousin
av mine, an' I hadn't seen her since she was a bit av a child. Now
she was grown up—an' as I looked into her big, grey Irish eyes, as
clear, an yet as soft as the colour av the Twelve Pins on a Spring
mornin', and listened to the sweet musio av the bewitohinist brogue
that all her ixpinsiv eddication hadn't extrackted from her—aye!
an' took ber little hand to lead her out for the last dance, an' made
her laugh tellin' her stories av the days when she was a Girshee, I
forgot me duties, lost me Note-book, disremembered Aunt Penelope,
made the Equerry a present of his I. 0. U.-s, an', in short, determined
that she was a kind av Cousin to be at " wanst removed."
I confess to a squeeze an' a whisper, an' I record me appreciation
av Aunt Penelope's sympathetic slumbrocity The dear
girl insisted on the whole party aooompanying me to Belfast to wit-
ness the last journalistic duties I shall perform.
Thursday, an' cetera ad fin. — Belfast pours forth its pent-up
loyalty. Takin' me advioe, the Pbince turned, like the attractive
Magnate he is, to the North! an' the result was, a rush an' a flash
av Northern Lights, that blazed on every hill, an' in every sturdy
north country heart. More dan em', and a power of beauty at all the
functions. I've seen an' heard the " Belles of Shandon, disported
meself with the dainty damsels av Dublin, an' laughed with the
Limeriok lasses; but these Angels av Antrim are p'raps the finest
—(Be quiet, Nobah agra!)—any way. they have fairly reversed a
certain Royal record of long ago. The Illustrious has nad an Irish
cold, but is better—so have I, several " Irish colds," an' am much
better.
So it all ended. Me Illustrious friend gave me gracious congratu-
lations, an' his cigarette-oase, an' a promise to lunch at Castle
Hegarty when he comes over next. In reply, I could only say that
he had behaved all through his visit like the Prince an' gentleman
he is. The Equerry (who is now doin' well with the rest av the
Suite, an', like meself, "gettin' home" rapidly) is to be the best
man. I mane to be a resident absentee for the future, and if you
Mr. Punch, and all kind friends over your side, will only wish us
well, and prepay those prisints, there won't be a happier or loyaler

There's Nobah callin' me to know if I think shamrocks will go well
with or an ge- blossom s P Good-bye! Bless you!
HOW TO UTILISE AN EXPLOSION.
The Morning Post having told us how a fair American Actress
breakfasted with the Pbemxeb on the day of the "Admiralty
Outrage," and subsequently performed with great success at the
theatre, reports of a similar character are to hand by hundreds. We
reproduce a few that have already reached us:—
Mr. J. L. T b was in the Booking-Office when he heard a loud
noise, which for a moment prevented him from continuing the calcu-
lations in whioh he was engaged. Almost immediately regaining
his oomposure, he returned to his labours, and found that every place
in his theatre had been taken for three months in advance.
Mr. H. I g was conversing with Miss E n T y in St.
James's Park, on their road to the L m, when the ground was
shaken under their feet. The fair artiste uttered an exclamation of
astonishment, when Mr. I g, with great presence of mind, assured
her there was no cause for alarm, and finished the anecdote he was
narrating about the immense sums realised in America.
Mr. P s, the well-known inventor of the celebrated Savon, was
washing his hands when the explosion occurred. The piece of soap
he was using was actually jerked out of his grasp by the force of the
concussion, but being from his own manufactory was of such admi-
rable quality that it suffered no damage.
A Gentleman walking under the Admiralty wall at the time of the
outrage was thrown to the ground with enormous force. Being
pioked up by the bystanders, ne smilingly explained that he "was
all right, as the A y braces he had in use were constructed to
bear any possible strain." On examination it was found that his
confidence in the admirable article was not misplaoed.
A Shoe-black stationed in Spring Gardens insists that he saw a
mysterious foreigner shortly before the explosion^ happened. He
distinctly remembers the exact time, as only a few minutes previously
he had been opening a packet of the celebrated N n Blacking.
John Jones asserts that he heard the report as far away from
London as Battersea, where he sleeps at night, being employed
during the daytime at the celebrated G e Dinner at the C-—n,
Piccadilly, which is nightly crowded by the elite of Society, wishing
to enjoy an exoellent table d'hote banquet and some capital part-
songs at the moderate charge of three shillings and sixpence a head.
Mr. G-—l, the world-famous perfumer, asserts that the smell of
the gunpowder or dynamite, on the fateful Thursday, was so strong
ten miles from the scene of the explosion, that he was forced to scent
his handkerchief with his " Fruit Bloom Bouquet," whioh is renowned
as the strongest and best scent in the civilised world. The effect of
this course was magical, and for leagues round the inhabitants
believed, from the delightful fragrance surrounding them, that the
cherry trees had burst into blossom.
Lastly, our own Mr. Briefless, Junior, of Pumphandle Court
(whose contribution to our columns is, in oonsequenoe of the explo-
sion, held over till next week), was on the point of receiving a packet
of papers from an influential client when the outrage took place. On
his recovering, both client and papers were gone, and our learned
friend's memory was so affected by the shock that he could not oall to
mind the name of the olient, although he had no doubt whatever that
the documents must have been manufactured by Messrs. P e aits
C b, the long-established law and general stationers, whose stock
of fancy articles has reached an extraordinary degree of excellence.

useful on land or sea in the event of any Continental Wairfare.
Exercise I.—Fob the Navr.
Is our ooal run out P It is (run out). Why do we not sail to the
nearest coaling station? Because all the coal of the nearest coaling
station has been burnt by the small cruiser of the prudent enemy.
You are jesting. Pardon me, I do not jest at all. I perceive the
large ironclad of the enemy. Will you tell them not to tire at our
unarmoured ends? Is it possible, they are firing at our unarmoured
end*! Let us load the big gun. Why can we not load the big gun?
Because we have not the large powder. Have you the enemy's big
gun (the big gun of the enemy) P No—the enemy has our big gun.
Who has our fine ships P The enemy has them. Is that a whale
advancing, or a torpedo boat? It is not a whale. The enemy have
the fine torpedoes, but we have not the strong wire nets. Has the
foreigner our wooden Admiralty official? He has not our wooden
Admiralty official, but he has our good ships. Will your Czar thank
the economical Admiralty of the trusting Englishmen? He will, Sir!
Exercise II.—Fob the Aumt.
(a) On the March.—We have the blue spectacles, the Japanese
umbrellas and the amusing parlour games, but we have not the sur-
gical appliances. Has the cook of the regiment the good Australian
beef? He has none of the good Australian beef, but a good deal of
the compressed English horse-radish. Your ugly camel has the red
mange. All the ugly camels have the red mange. Have we plenty
of the fresh water P We have not the fresh water, but we have the
empty water-tanks. I have the tinned meat of the wealthy con-
tractor, and I have also the severe stomach complaint (or the severe
complaint at the stomach).
(6) In the Field.—What gun has the enemy P He has the good
gun. Have you the Martini-Henry rifle? I have the Martini-
Henry .rifle, and the composite-case cartridges. Why does the General
alter the letter of the candid correspondent P The action is beginning,
though we have not yet all our troops.
We have only to keep on firing a little longer and we shall win the
battle 1 Why do you not keep on firing P Because I cannot get the
composite-ease cartridge out of the Martini-Henry rifle. How much
is my gun worth P Is it worth as much as that of your friend P I
should prefer to have the Brown Bess of the brave ally, or the
leaden peashooter of my naughty boy.
Are the Cossacks coming P They are. Let us form square and fix
the bayonets. We have fixed the bayonets, but they are bent. Are
they soft? They are (toft). We will draw our swords. Some of
the swords will draw, but they will not out. It is fortunate, then,
my dear friend, that we have the Gardner gun. Why do you not
fire the Gardner gun? It is jammed. We are very (tree) unfortu-
nate (malheureux). We must not trust everybody. Shall we
surrender P We will not surrender, since we do not prefer life to
death. Will the War Office of the Englishmen be mentioned in the
despatches of the General of the victorious enemy P

horses Y If all these, he is Julian The Accomplished. But I fancy
I am wrong. The music is by Abthue Gobing Thomas, of whom
there was onoe a sketch in these pages, with a horn accompaniment
suggestive of the "Goring." On this his latest work I make
him my sincere compliments. It was " written and composed," the
title-page informs me, "for the Carl Rosa Company," which was
a plucky speculation on the part of Cabl Rosa. In the next page of
the book is given a list of the Dramatit Persona, which, besides
the principals and the "Serfs, Armed Servants, Pages," &c, includes
the names of—
Conductor Mr. Alberto Randeggeb.
Mise-en-Ssene .... Mr. Augustus Harris.
The latter name being put in as if it were that; of the Good Fairy
of the piece—the deus ex maehini,—the machine being the practi-
cable 'bus, who will put everything to-rights, and make everybody
nappy ever afterwards.
At this point of my fore-
casting I am suddenly
interrupted by loud ap-
plause, and, looking up, I
see some one standing up
in the orchestra, and
bowing.
At first sight I feel in-
clined to exclaim, " Hullo!
why that's Lord Gran-
ville I what on earth is
he doing here?" when, by
the aid of my opera-
glasses, I ascertain that it
is Mr. Alberto Randeg-
geb, whose appearance is
hailed with delight, for
now we know that the

Up goes Curtain, and here we are in Russia!
The PoetiofLibrettist thus describes the scene in his book, "Mid-
summer in Russia—a smiling sunny land, through which a river
flows." What a pity it is, and what a number of commentators
would have been thrown out of employment, had Shakspbarb only
been half as communicatively descriptive as Julian the Accomplished!
He tells us, as he must have previously told the good Fairy, Augustus

These are something like stago-directions. Evidently Julian the

with, "mind you have a river

ripening wheat-field, and every-
thing I want; because, if you
do not, I shall have the whole
description printed in the book,
and the audience will know
whom to blame if everything isn't in its proper place. See?"
Poor Mr. Mise-en-Scene promised it should all be there—and there
it is. And "the Serfs, men and girls," are "making merry" in the way
a Chorus always will make merry, whether they oe Serfs or Nobles.
The musio is very spirited, and
Mr. Mise-en-Scenb's action
good. Then in comes a black-
looking rascal, whose name the
well-informed person next me
says is Podsnap. This I re-
oeive with incredulity, and
refer to the book, where I find
that the Villain of the deepest
dyed black wig and willan v is
called Ottap,—which name has
in it a combination of the
stable and public-house,—both
very natural, he being a Serf,
and employed in some menial
office or other. He makes some
apparently rude remarks,—and
here, without reference to the
book, I cannot help observing
that it is difficult to distin-
guish the difference between
an Opera in English and one in
Italian,—at all events, at some
distance off.
From the book by Julian
the Accomplished I gather that Podsnap is telling us in song that—
"The wolf she has fled away
And has left her whelp for our annoy."
Which is probably some Russian idiom, for which I take J ulias's
word. But Podsnap only gets
laughed at, and then in comes
Nadeshda, and when Podsnap,
who is her ruffianly adorer, and
the merry-making Chorus leave
her a minute to herself, she
takes advantage of it to sing a
charmingly orchestrated song,
"O River, dear River!"
After this song, which is, I
venture to think, the gem of the
Opera, and given by Madame
Alwina Vallebia in her very
best style, Nadeshda runs off to
join the merry-makers,—they
are still at it outside, some-
where in among the ripening
wheat, or all among the barley,—
and enter two personages whom

bound to say, I subsequently find that these two gentleman are
respectively Voldemar, and Ivan, his bad brother. I amove

George the Third then (for I firmly believe that what 1 am wit-
nessing is an episode in that monarch's early life, only that for
political reasons not unassooiated with Mr. Gladstone and "an
arrangement," the names have been changed, and the story made
Russian) falls in love with Nadethda, a Housemaid,—real name "No
Duster," because she always
uses a broom,—of whom
Podtnap the Potboy, and
Dick Tukpin, the Gentle-
man Highwayman, are also
enamoured.
George the Third's
Mamma, played with much
melodramatic majesty by
Miss Josephine Yorke,—if
she were a soprano she might
be the" Yorke and Albani,"
but she isn't,—is naturally
against the match, and
comes on attended by. ap-
parently, three fighting
Bishops, in military uni-
forms and mitres, to stop it.
She doesn't succeed, for
Dick Turpin kills Podtnap
the Potboy, and Turpin,
who doesn t ride to York,
but is brought to Yorke on
a litter, explains that, after
stabbing him with intent to kill, Podtnap had succeeded beyond his
most sanguine hopes in an attempt on his own (Podtnap11) life, and
that as far as he (Turpln) is concerned, George tile Third may
marry No-Duster, and be hanged to him. So the Duchess of Yorke
withdraws her objection, and all ends happily by about eleven o'clock.
The acting and singing good; some of Julian the Aocomplished's
Eusso-English delightful. The Orchestra too loud,—it is very fully
orchestrated,—which necessitates prolonged and exciting strife
between Singers and Musicians. Mr. Mise-en-Scene has done his
work well, so has Conductor Randegger. Its composer, Thomas,
has done exceeding well, and so has the enterprising Carl Rosa,
who, I trust, will be stimulated to fresh efforts in the cause of Opera
by his present successful production. Nibbs.

A CITY GUILD IN TROUBLE.
There is a subtle vein of humour in Mr. Justice Day that he en-
deavours to conceal with as much effort as some of his learned Brethren
make to display their want of it. His Lndship had, last week, with
the assistance of no less than five Counsel
learned in the law, to determine whether
it was imperative that the Worshipful
Company of Masons should have a Court
of twenty-four Assistants to carry on its
affairs. The original Charter, granted
by his most religious and graoious Ma-
jesty, Charles the Second, was pro-
duced in Court, and is described by the
irreverent Reporter as a very wizened
and musty-looking document. It pre-
scribes that twenty-four Assistants snail
be appointed; and although it was stated
t hat t here was little or nothing for them
io assist in doing, the Judge slily re-
marked that there might be something
lor them to receive, and so he decided
that twenty-four should be the number,
and ordered the poor Company to pay
all the casts, which will probably be the
means of curtailing their bounteous hos-
pitality for some time to come.
I am not, I regret to say, intimately
acquainted with the inner life of this
Worshipful Company, or whether Masons
are an increasing or diminishing race,
are, 1 believe, rapidly becoming small
It does so happen that, some
_ p. 1 was personally acquainted with the last surviving
member of the Worshipful Company of Paviors, and, with that
audacity that belongs to mature manhood, I proposed to him to
resuscitate the moribund Company, and instil into it a renewed life
worthy of so useful and so anoient a fraternity. After the usual
time allowed for reflection, the Last of the Paviors assented. My
friend was to be the Worshipful Master, I was to be the Wine-
Warden, for which important position a lengthened acquaintance
with City hospitality had well fitted me, a mutual friend well
acquainted with accounts,—that is to say, other people's accounts,
his own had not been particularly prosperous,—was to be Rentes
Warden, and a nephew of mine, who was evidently intended to shine
in Society, if Society had not been so very expensive, was to be the
Clerk, with a salary of £200 a-year to commence with.
The inquiry naturally arises, whence were the funds to come to
supply—Firstly, the fees for the Master and Wardens ; Secondly, the
Salary of the Clerk; Thirdly, the Banquets, so absolutely necessary
to the existence of a City Guild. Questions easily asked and as
easily answered. Be it then known unto all men that there are two
kinds of City Guilds, or Mysteries, as they are properly called. The
one kind are the Swell Companies, who abound in Wealth, in
Benevolence, in Education, and in the grand Christian virtue of
Hospitality. The noblest of all noble institutions are they, and long
may they remain unsullied by the grasping hand of hungry
Radicalism! But there is also another kind of Guild, and these,
being almost penniless, scrape together a few paltry guineas by
making Liverymen at reduced prices. It was on this hint that I
spake to my solitary Pavior.
"If a man," said I, "is desirous of becoming a Liveryman in
order to get a vote for the City, let us offer him a large discount for
ready money, and to any agent who will bring fresh victims, a large
allowance on bringing a quantity. I know that this is done con-
stantly on a very large scale, and a small reduction in the entrance
fee will bring us in a princely income." The whole thing was
arranged, the final conditions were to be settled at a banquet to be
S'ven by our prospective Master, when, sad to say, he fell suddenly
, was ordered off to Brighton, and never returned. The Paviors'
Company thereupon ceased to exist, and is no longer to be found in
the list of City Guilds, but I believe that Messrs. Mowlex, Burt
and Freeman are ready to testify that, despite that fearful calamity,
City Paviors are doing as well as can be expected.
Should the Masons wish to bring this somewhat Past Grand
Company to its former condition of splendour, and prosperity, and
popularity, they had better apply at once to one who is, at present,
An Outsider.
P.8.—My terms are very moderate. Five per cent, on the feeB,
and an invitation to all Banquets.

Visitor at Country House. "Bf the btb, you didn't know who I was this Mornino, Marguerite 1"

THE POLITICAL "MRS. GUM MIDGE."
A "Dickens" of a SrruATioir.
Mas. Gummidgk-Gladstone had been in a low state for some
time, and had almost burst into tears when a chill gust from the
North, coming suddenly, and—to her—unexpectedly down the ohim-
ney, had blown the lid off the bubbling saucepan, and the soot into
the stew therein.
"I am a much-orossed cretur'," were Mrs. Gukmtdge's words,
when that unpleasant occurrence took place, "and every think goes
oontrairy with me."
"Oh, it'll soon leave off," said Mr. Pegootty-Bull—meaning
the North wind,—" and besides, you know, it's not more disagree-
able to you than it is to us."
"I feel it more," said Mrs. Gummtdge-Gladstone.
It was indeed a very cold, cheerless day, with cutting blasts of
wind, which seemed to blow from every quarter at once, but from
the North and East fur choice. Mrs. Qummidge's peculiar corner of
the fireside seemed—to her at least—to be the chilliest and most
unoomfortable, as her seat was certainly the hardest. She complained
of the North-Easter and of its visitation just at this time and at her
back, which she said gave her the " oreeps."
"It is certainly very uncomfortable," said Mr. Peggottt-Bull.
"Everybody must feel it so."
"I feel it more than other people," said Mrs. Gum mi doe.
So at dinner. The fish—from which she had expected great things
—were small and bony, and the stew was smoky and burnt. All
acknowledged that they felt this something of a disappointment, bnt
Mrs. Gummidge said she felt it more than they did, and again made
that former declaration with great bitterness—" I'm a much-crossed
cretur', and every think goes oontrairy with me."
Later, when Mr. Peggottt-Bull came home to tea, this unfor-
tunate Mrs. Gummidoe-Gladstone was knitting in her corner, in a
very wretched and miserable condition. Her knitting—a nondescript
pieoe of work—seemed to be a regular Egyptian labyrinth for com-
plicated tangle, and a very Penelope's web for inoonolusiveness and
power of alternate weaving and unweaving. "Cheer up, Grand
Mawther!" cried Mr. Peggottt-Bull. (Mr. Pegoottt meant
Grand Old Girl.)
Mrs. Gummdoe did not appear to be able to oheer up. She dropped
her knitting with a gesture of despair.
"What's amiss, Dame ?" said Mr. Peggottt-Bull.
"Everythink!" returned Mrs. Gummidge. "Including you" she
continued, dolefully. "You've a willing mind to face the troubles
before you, but you ain't ready. I'm sorry it should be along o' me
that you 're so unready."
"Along o' you? It ain't along o' you!" said Mr. Pegoottt, good-
naturedly, and perhaps without quite meaning it. "Don't ye believe
a bit on it."
"Yes, yes, it is!" cried Mrs. Gummidge-Gladstonk. "I know
what I am. I know that I am a much-crossed cretur', and not only
that everythink goes oontrairy with me, but that I go oontrairy with
everybody. Yes, yes. I feel more than other people do, and I show
it more. It's my misfortun.'"
One really couldn't help thinking that the misfortune extended to
some other Members of that House, besides Mrs. Gum midge.
"I ain't what I could wish myself to be," said Mrs. Gummidge.
"I am far from it. I know what I am. My troubles has made me
oontrairy. I feel my troubles, and they makes me oontrairy. 1
wish I didn't feel them, but 1 do. I wish I could be harden'd to 'em,
but I ain't. If I felt less, I could do more. I make the House
unoomfortable. I don't wonder at it. It's far from right that I
should do it. I'd better leave the House. I'm a much-crossed
cretur', and had better not make myself oontrairy here. If thinks
must go oontrairy with me, and I must go oontrairy myself, let me
go oontrairy alone at my own place. I'd better leave the House,
and retire and be a riddanoe."
Mr. Peggottt-Bull, whose countenance had exhibited the mixed
traces of many feelings, including puzzlement, impatience, and pro-
found sympathy, looked upward at a portrait of an ancient, but
buck-like and somewhat Hebraic personage upon the wall, and,
shaking Ids head, with a lively expression of those mixed
■till animating his face, said, in a solemn whisper,
"She's been thinking of the Old 'Un I"

Find myself in Central Asia talking to a son of Holy Russia, one General
Haircomboff. Ask him what he is doing there. Answers that he is " fulfilling
Russia's Heaven-appointed mission of civilising Asia." Has been at it for years,
and hopes one day to "crown the edifice "—in India and Constantinople. Ask
him if / can be of any assistance to him in so noble an enterprise. Looks at me
significantly through his spectacles, and replies " Rather I" Am glad to hear
it, and ask how. By " simplifying the situation," he answers. I do not quite
follow him, so he endeavours to explain. Explanation rather confuses me, how-
ever. His evident impatience is relieved by receipt of a telegram, which he
reads eagerly. "Ha!" he cries, "Don't advance —unless obliged to." Quite
so! Then I must be " obliged to as soon as possible. They must oblige me by
"obliging me."
Again I fail to follow him, but subsequent events throw a light upon his
meaning, and "simplify the situation"—though not the facts—amazingly.
Haxrcomroff seta to work to "avoid a conflict." He does bo by calling one
side of the river where he has no business, "our bank of the Rushk," and
advancing thereon. He then organises what he calls "pleasure-trips" and
"reconnaissances." When I inquire why he calls them so, he replies, " What's
in a name P" Finding that his "pleasure-trip" alarms the Afghans, he calls
! alarm "audacity and arrogance," and acts accordingly. That is to say,
"an energetic summons" (equivalent, in fact, to the preliminary "Now,

i, to the act of " collaring " on the part of the " chuoker-out"), and finding

aid of a military picnic, some convenient phrases, and a
massacre, the situation is satisfactorily simplified.
Haircomboff is jubilant. I ask him what part he
thinks / have played, or can play, in this little tragi-
comedy of perverted facts and misapplied phrases. He
replies that 1 had offered to assist him. 1 say 1 shall be
glad to do so, by editing his telegrams and despatches.
He scowls, says 1 am audacious and arrogant, and is
about to make a " pacific advance" on me, when I dazzle
him momentarily with a fiash of my mirror, and take my
flight, convinced that 1 cannot at present be of muoh
assistance to Holy Russia in Central Asia.
• * • • •
My next visit is to the Editorial Sanctum of a London
newspaper. Editor asks, " to what happy circumstance he
owes the honour of my visit 1"' I say report informs
me that there is an opening on his paper for—well, in
point of fact, for Myself. He fidgets in his seat, and
hesitatingly inquires, "In what capacity? I explain
that, being, from my nature, independent of those limita-
tions of time and space which even the most energetic
and indefatigable Specials cannot entirely surmount, I
might make myself generally useful, especially in dis-
tant parts, communications from which are slow, uncer-
tain, and by no means always reliable. I say this with
a comfortable inward conviotion that he will jump at the
offer. But he doesn't. He jumps, indeed, but it is rather
as though he were suddenly bitten by a mosquito—or his
conscience. (I conclude, subsequently, that it must have
been the former.) To simplify the situation," I men-
tion the words, "Central Asia." He jumps again, this
time more violently than before. I proceed to say that,
some five minutes ago, I parted with General Hair-
comboff on the KuBhk, and that I can tell him But
here he actually jumps from his Beat at once. "For
Heaven's sake, don't.' It's more than my situation is
worth to listen to you I" I am puzzled.
Regaining his composure, with an evident effort, he
tells me, that "reports on these matters reach him
through the—ah—usual channels, that at present he has
not an opening for Me, and that he fears my particular
services would neither be useful to the Paper nor appre-
ciated by the Public. I am surprised, and say so. He
assures me I am entirely mistaken. He tells me that
Truth as a Special Correspondent, especially in foreign
parts, with "a free hand," would completely upset all
the parties, nearly all the papers, and most of the
potentates and financiers, the latter especially. Nobody,
he affirms, wants any more of the Truth than is likely
to be useful to himself and his own side, and damaging
to his own opponents. This is of necessity a limited
quantity. The uses of Falsehood, in this sense, are, on
the oontrary, unlimited. "But," say I, " I thought that
you made rather a special boast of your striot allegiance
to Truth." "That," he replies, "is part of the game.
Everybody," he continues, "worships you—while you
keep in your Well. But when you come out of it, and
stand at our elbow like this, you—you really upset us."
"As regards General Haircomboff, then," I begin,
when he impatiently interrupts me. "Hang General
Haircomboff!" he ejaculates. "The trouble I've had
to put a fair face upon his proceedings, even though aided
by his own ingenious Muscovite glasses, by official
optimism, and by feminine finesse, you would hardly
believe. To furnish diurnally a sophistical special-
pleader with a bouncing title, the one worthy of
Mephistophveles, the other of Mendez Pinto, is, I
assure you, no light task."
"Why attempt itP" I inquire. "There is reason,"
he replies, "in the roasting of eggs, and in the writing
of Leading Articles." If you know anything against
Haircomboff and his friends, don't bring it here and
inorease my difficulties. Take it to Bosky of the 'Rata-
plan,' who is on the opposite tack. He '11 welcome it,—
so much at least of it as makes for his case. You cannot,
in reason, expect any of us to welcome more."
I leave him. But I do not go to Bosky of the
Rataplan." I feel indeed that I can be of little more
service in Newspaperdom than in Central Asia.

'Stop, able Editor, I pray,
Tho lino that, off yrm'n
The Hoes that off you're reeling.
What's this you tell of, day by day,
'The Feeling '—what's The Feeling?"
"The Feeling! 'Tis a moment's flush
Prompt into ioe congealing,
A public spasm, a shriek, a rush,
That's what we call The Feeling.
"'Tis first a military haste.
For instant battle ' peeling,'
And then some months of wait and waste,
That, also, is The Feeling.
"The wild desire to meet the foe,
Then for his mercy kneeling;
It seldom comes to more, you know,
The momentary Feeling!
"The Feeling clamours for advance,
And then for backward wheeling;
The Daily Papers lead the dance,
And hurry on The Feeling.
"The Feeling lives on ' Horful News!'
That paper-boys are squealing;
The Feeling grudges ships and r~
Unpatriotic Feeling!
"Canarrf-like doth The Feeling fly
Through Marts where men are aeuwg,
And stocks are low, or stocks are high,
Obedient to The Feeling."
"And what shall be the end of all?"
"Ah, that there's no revealing;
Except that many a People's fall
Has followed on The Feeling!"

INTERIORS AND EXTERIORS. No. 9.

PLACE AUX DAMES!" A TURN-HIM-OTJT MEETING AT ST. JAMES'S HALL.
ESSENCE OP PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FKOM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Common*, Monday Night, April 20.—David Davies is,
unmistakeably, a Welshman. But often, in dismissing public affairs,
manages to typify John Bull. Davis's oratorical attitude a little
peculiar. Stands with fingers interlaced, twiddling thumbs, whilst
he " chucks out" at House roughly framed sentences.
"I don't know," says he, just now, "whether we have enough
ship—but we should have enough."
'That's John Bull, to a shade," says Solicitor General, look-
ing admiringly at the rugged Member for Cardiganshire, with his
odd accent. J. B. hasn't a notion as to what's the truth about the
Navy. Hears a great deal said about it, particularly by persons in
Opposition; and, when he hears W. H. Smith eloquent on the
subject, has a slight suspicion that, bad as things may he, the Navy
couldn't have gone to the .dogs in four or five years, and perhaps
ex-First Lords of the Admiralty would be wiser to take a back seat
during discussions on this particular subject. But he feels, as
Davies says, that we should nave enough, and the Government are
wise in looking to it."
David scouts all notions of economy in the matter. "I shouldn't
mind," he says, "if we had half a dozen Iron-olads too many lying
up till they were wanted"—as if they were a lot of clay pipes, in
process of colouring. Also the martial soul of the Member for
Cardiganshire " wouldn't mind if there was a bit of a brush, so that
we could see what our Iron-clads were like."
On the whole a luminous generous view of the subject David takes,
always twiddling his thumbs as if that were part of the machinery
of his vocal organs, which indeed it seemed to be, for when he acci-
dentally unloosed his hands he suddenly stopped just as he was about
to order a couple of dozen or so of torpedoes, and feeling round for
his hat, dropped into his seat.
Next to this the speech of the evening was by W. J. Harris,
elected last year for Poole. Not quite sure it wasn't his maiden
effort. Evidently made great efforts to get it up. Meant to come
round to the Navy by-and-by. In the meantime began with wheat.
Twenty-six million quarters of wheat we consume in a year, it
appears, and only grow nine millions 1 Now that, of course, won't
do. Seventeen million quarters short is very serious. Harris
struggling out of deficit, about to show Committee where they were
when Chairman interposed. Said " all this had nothing to do with
the question," and before Harris quite knew where he was, B basset
was at the table, humming and hawing in his ridiculous fashion over
an inadequate Navy. Never saw a man so honestly astonished as
the hapless Harris. Sat with voluminous notes clutched in his
right hand, mouth slightly parted, eyes distinctly starting in his
head, slowly gazing round House. Look arrested, when it fell in
that direction, by finding Bbasset on his legs at the Table, plainly
wondering how it was that Secretary to the Admiralty was addressing
Committee whilst he (Harris) was sitting down silent. Why, he'd
only just opened his speech, and hadn't yet accounted for that seven-
teen million quarters of wheat I

Afghanistan. In absence of Ashmead-Bartlett, Stafford North-
cote assumed the function of Leader of Opposition, and put questions
to Premier. Nothing particular said in reply.

A New K6le fob Her.
"Mr. Bull, Bare, I teach you. I am fov the Liberty of the Press!"
As soon as Questions were over, Prem ieh: bserved walking out of
House at rate of four miles an hour.
"Ha, ha!" cried_ Wolff, rubbing his knees. "I thought when
critical moment arrived it would come to this. You see, Randolph,
he's positively running away. Can't faoe prospect of taking Vote of
Credit for War. Has given up everything to Russia on the frontier,
humiliated England, gone down on his knees to the Czas begging
him to be good enough to take whatever he wants, and now he's
positively running away from the House of Commons!"
"Henry Drummond," said Randolph, sternly, "don't be an
Wolff."
Gladstone reaching Bar faced about and stood for a moment with
a paper in his hand. Speaker making believe to discover him there
slightly started, and called out "Mr. Gladstone!" "A Vote of
Credit," says Gladstone. "Pass friend with Vote of Credit," says
Speaker. Captain Gosset sheathed the drawn sword, the Prime
Minister marched back to the Treasury Bench, and proceeded to
explain the Vote of Credit. Read his statement; listened to with
grave attention by the House. No bluster, no bounce; a simple
matter of practical business. Russia challenged England to a fight.
Very well. Let's see how much it'll cost to begin with. Say six
millions and half, which, with four and a half to close Soudan
account, makes eleven.
"That's about the figure, I think," says Gladstone.
"Very well," says the House. "If you want any more, don't be
afraid to say so."
The whole business over in twenty minutes, and House again in
Committee on Seats Bill. Parnellites got up one or two little diver-
sions, but Otwax not to be played with; so, by Eleven o'Clook, Bill
through Committee, and Christening Party dispersed.
Then Joseph Gillis rises, and wants to discuss Cloture arrange-
ments. To the impartial mind of this great man it appears that
under existing Rules, Speaker and Chairman of Committees enjoy
dangerously arbitrary authority. Joseph just beginning to wax
eloquent and convincing, when Cloture suddenly descends upon him
in form of Count Out. This was a little unexpected, the House
being more habituated to see Joseph Count than to find him Counted.
But he bore the indignity with his accustomed unruffled demeanour.
"It's me arguments that scares 'em," he said, as he tied up his
papers and dropped them in the capacious recesses of his coat-tail-
pockets. "But they'll have 'em yet. If I don't do it afore, I'll
make the speech on the Appropriation Bill."
Business done.—Vote of Credit brought in.
Thursday.—House been in Committee all night on Civil Service
Supply. Vote for disturnpiked roads in Scotland stoutly opposed by
Parnellites. Hibbert in charge of votes expressed mild surprise.
Irish votes not included in business of the evening. Thought he
was going to have nice quiet time. But just as he was walking
along Scotch disturnpiked road admiring beauty of the scenery and
steadiness of the rainfall, suddenly upon turning corner comes upon
Skxton, Healt, and the rest, who say ne shall go no farther to-night.
"Dear me," says Hibbert, nervously—" bo pleased to meet you
here. Rather a surprise. Thought you were waiting elsewhere for
Campbell-Bannebman. But to delighted to meet you. May I
ask what you want?"
Certainly he might, and through five long hours they
told him. Fact is, Ireland does not get subvention for
roads, therefore Scotland shall not have it. This put with
great clearness and firmness, Joseph Gillis contributing
not less than six orations to clearing up any doubts that
might remain in Hibbert's mind. Division at last, and
Vote agreed to.
Then we stumble upon a perfectly delicious disclosure.
It appears there's a water-way in Ireland called the
Ulster Canal; made at enormous cost; maintained at
heavy annual charge. When nicely finished, discovered
to be practically useless; didn't go anywhere particular;
during last five years has earned about £1 a week, whilst
£1,100 a year being spent upon keeping it up.
"What can we do?" piped Hlbbert in mournful
treble. "You say, 'Sell the Canal,' but nobody '11 buy
it. We might give it away, but who '11 take it T"
Then came a voice, sharp and clear, across the floor of
the House. "I '11 take it, said Joseph Gillis. And the
Secretary to the Treasury sat down, utterly flabbergasted.
"It was done in a moment of impulse, Toby, Joet
B. told me afterwards. "Of
course it'll be a nuisance
to me. What can a man do
with a Canal? He can't
carry it about with him;
he can't fold it up, and put
it away in the attio till it 's
wanted. But the fack is,
I'm not so hard-hearted as
I'm painted. This 'ere
Goovernment's in a bad way; every-
thing goin' agin 'em. This Ulster Canal
seems like to be the last thing that '11
break 'em. Besides, Hibbert s such a
good fellow; it was pitiful to see him
looking round the House, and asking
who'd take the Canal. So, on the spur
of the moment, I said I would. And
I '11 be as good as my word. I know
therel's not much of a market for second-
hand Canals. But I '11 stand the racket."
Business done.—Joseph Gillis takes
the Ulster Canal.
Friday.—A lively night |to finish up
week withal. First news that the
French Charge d'Affaires left Cairo.

hot haste another messenger; turns out
he brings conclusion of message. What Charge d'Affaires has
"left" is not Cairo, but "some papers."
_ "Half a telegram may be better than no information, but it some-
times leads to misapprehension," says the bewildered Bourse.
Finally Conservatives and Parnellites form sudden alliance and
defeat Government on Irish Registration Bill. Things going more
than ever " oontrairy."
THE LAW OF "LOAFING."
A Graduate of Trinity, Cambridge, described as a teacher of
mathematics, was lately pulled up at Wandsworth for begging. The
sole evidence for this charge was that of a Constable, who said that, in
consequence of information which he received at the Putney Polioe-
Station, "he went out, and heard the jprisoner ask for bread." That
was all. Defence—downright destitution and starvation. The
"prisoner" said "he was literally starving and fainting with
hunger." Further, in reply to the remark from the Bench that, as
he was an educated man, he must know that begging was not
allowed, Prisoner pleaded that "in asking for a piece of bread he
was not aware that he was begging." But begging he was; for
although the sitting Magistrate (who dispensed as leniently as. he
could the law he was of course bound to administer) forbore to send
him to prison, and " allowed him to be discharged," he let him off,
however, "with a caution." But does the Vagrant Act or any other
Statute really declare asking for bread to be a punishable act of
mendicancy? This perhaps is a point which might be referred to
Counsel's opinion. But even if entreaty for a morsel of bread he
really illegal, it may still be suggested that in the matter of
oancy what the Law says is not all Gospel.

1 nose it. For
the one thing as
in the hinnercen-
oy of my art I
rote down, ony a
few weeks ago,
as a meer fleetin
wision of fansy,
with no more
thort of its cum-
ming trew than if
1,'d a torked of
praps being won
day a Depurty
Alderman, or a
Hirish Hem Pea,
or sum sitch Orty
Offishel, has hac-
shally cum to pass, ana i 'ye bin presinted with a Testy-moniel, and
that too from them as I most respeos, that is, my feller Waiters as
nose me best. It was guv too at a dinner, all in propper style, and
Brown took the Cheer, having me in his seat of honner on his rite
and. We wasn't charged nuffin for the room, as it was on a Sattur-
day, alius a slack day with us, and young Mr. Swkei un sent us a
nice peaoe of 8ammon—jest praps a little hoverhiced—but Waiters
mustn't be Chewsers—witch, the lad said, oum from Home, but I
wasn't quite sitch a fool as to bleeve that, till I recklected as it ment
the Yung Senier Partner, and werry kind it was of both on 'em, but
they is a ginrous cupple, and a credit to their country as natives.
We hadn't no reglar hor-douvers but we all had a nice glass of gin
and bitters, jest to giv us a start, and then we set to work like a
emadginary Court of Aldermen! I says emadginary, ooz Aldermen
ain't sitch werry grand trenchermen as the hungry Puhlick thinks. I
ooud pick out won or too well seesoned Deputtys as 'ud beat 'em all
holler. Our Mavnu was simple but sattisfying. We didn't have
not no Soup, no thankee, we nose too well what soup is by the time
Satterdy nite oums. But the Summon afoursaid, one simple arntray,
kidneys, Hum-stakes, and Biled leg of Mutton, ain't so werry bad
wen you 're reel hungry, as we all was.
We was waited on by a pore feller as we all simperthises with.
His story is a werry sad un. He once filled the hi office of Assistent
Waiter at the Manshun House, and there conseeved such a absorbin
passhun for green Shartruse that it farely overcome him, and he had
to suckkum, and take a faltering step-down on the ladder of life.
May he be a he.xample to all on us 1
The Guvnors sent us up two bottles of remarkabel fine old Port,
ony jest a leetle caulked, with their oomplemens, and wished us a
flezzant evening, witch was werry kind of our hemployays, as the
'renoh calls 'em. We hadn't not no musick. We did jest try
"God save our grayshus Queen," but as we cum to a full stop in
the werry fust werse, we thort that praps it was as well to give it up.
So we soon oum to the sherrymonial of the heavening, and a werry
himposing one it were. The Plate was displayed in front of the
Chearman on a butiful sheet of reel tissue paper, and was much
admired by all on us. I need ardly say as it consisted of bLx solid
silver Tee Spoons, all exactly alike, with my old f ammerly crest of &.
hengraved on 'em in hold Inglish. Brown's speech I look upon—if
you can look upon a speech—as a werry moddel of wot such a speech
should be. Short but broad, frendly, yet respeoful, highly compli-
mentary, yet strickly true. And I don't mind confessing that wen
he guv the whole mass of silver into my trembling and, and said,
"Robert, my Tulip, there '11 be one a peace for all the pledges,"
tho' the word did sound jest a leetle Porn-Brokerish, it brort the
tears into my old eyes with hemotion. However, it was of coarse
necessary, as I should pull myself together—so I did it. With
regard to my hone speech, my nat'ral self-respeck makes me hold
my tung; but BBOWN told me afterwards—and Brown is, on all
important ooashuns, Truth itself—that he thort that, upon the
hole, he had never herd a speech that so muoh reminded him of
Mr. Gladstone in his best days. We all had boxes of sweets, as
they does at the swell Livery Companies, like the Butchers' and the
Jiners', ours was a sixpenny box of Jewjubes.
I am told by one of the Gentlemen as is Walley to a Hunder
Secondary of State, that this here year 1885 is to be one of the most
remarkablest and one of the most staggeringest of moddern times,
and Brown also tells me that a Mr. Zadkeel, who is werry ofun
either rite or rong, has Bed summat werry much to the same puppus.
With two sitch authorities in a cord it seems foolish to dout 'em.
And if I may presoom to judge from my own pussonal egsperienoe it
wood seem to confirm what is coming for to pass. Two things as
appened to me all-reddy, such as never even crost my mind in my
wildest dreams. I have bin asked for my Haughtygraff by the most
grashus and the most britest of all Lady Maresses, and I have
receeved a reel silver testymonial from my fellow man. Wot more
may be in store for me, or what the next 9 months may bring forth,
who nose? but, be that as it may, as deeply as my old fammerly
crest is ingraven on my butiful testymonial spoons, so deeply will
my reckleotions of the two great ewents of my umbel life be engraven
on my grateful Art, adding sum what, though umbly, to the other
importent ewents of this probbably ewentful year. Robert.
MORE TO FOLLOW.
Mb. Ciiildebs deserves mnoh praise for the details of his Budget,
but his great financial achievement is undoubtedly his unexpected
pounce upon the Gin-drinker. Gin is not absolutely a necessary of
life, and, in an age of criminal luxury, it is as well to begin some-
where,—even if it be at the bottom of the social scale,—in dealing
with gross self-indulgence. If, however, the war, if there be a war,
last, as experts tell us it must, several years, Chancellors of the
Exoheqner, who will have to find not fifteen but a hundred and fifty
Millions, will do well to follow so excellent a lead; and perhaps the
sooner Mr. Guilders, with an eye to the future, follows his own
example, the better.
At a moment when the trumpet blast is heard at every West End
Club, nothing could be more popular than a sudden impost of three
shillings and sixpence a hot tie, say, on champagne. Anyhow, the
experiment might be tried as a feeler, and if hailed, as we feel sure
it would be in every right-minded quarter, with enthusiasm, the
field could soon be rapidly enlarged, and the other proximate super-
fluities of life could follow literally by the heap.
With a tax of, if necessary, five hundred per cent, on little dinners,
diamonds, new hats, drawing-rooms, wedding breakfasts, three-
volume novels, dados, false hair, objeis d'Art, foot-warmers, prize
cucumbers, Dukedoms, scented soap, fox-hounds, Caviare, double-
barrelled surnames, and all the other accepted "extras" of modem
existence, the veriest Jingo could scarcely fail to face the grim
"circumstance of war," it not with absolute exhilaration, at least
with some consciousness of its material expense.
WORTH MENTIONING.
These are still some few things that they do manage better in
France, and one of them is the Salon, that is as far as the public are
concerned. They are now charging ten francs for entrance on
certain days, ana the surplus goes to the benefit of some charitable
or national fund. This ten francs is an excluding price, and insures
the comfort of those who detest a crowd. Why should there be
invitations for a Private View Day? What is the result P Why,
that the Private View Day, owing to the hospitality and generosity
of the Academicians, and to various other causes operating more or
less directly, is one of the most crowded days of the season, and
offers about the worst chance of obtaining anything like a fair view
of the pictures.
"Of course, you've not Been the pictures?" is what everybody
sarcastically says to everybody else on Private View Day; and only
a few persons who really love Art for its own sake, and who start
early to do the galleries conscientiously between ten and one, would
be able to answer that they had seen the pictures, or at all events,
the principal paintings of the year. The tickets for Private View
Day should be a guinea each, and the surplus on the ordinary
charge for admission could be devoted to the Artists' Benevolent
Fund. Then on other days admission should be two shillings
from the hours of opening up to midday, and from then till
closing time one shilling. On Sundays the Academy should be
open to the public free. The additional take from the guinea
tickets on the Private View Day, and the extra shillings of the
Morning Show, would more than suffice to defray the expenses of
whatever additional labour might be necessitated, and the work so
equalised among the increased number of beadles, cheque-takers,
cleaners, hat-and-coat men, &c, that everyone of them could get

PLAY-TIME.
Not muoh leisure for Plays this week. Nibbs being away for quiet,—
tran-quill Nibbs,—our Mr. Gkowlek went to see Tuykin at Toole's,
which he says is a sufficiently takin' pieoe, and as to Bad Boys at
the Comedy, he observes that the title is excellently chosen, as no
one will be disappointed. You can't expect Bad Buys to be Good
Boys, and, as Boys will be Boys, so Bad Boys will be Bad Boys,
A fellow who has seen its original Clara Soleil in Paris, says it was
amusing enough there. We must get our Mr. Gcseeb to go with
our Mr. Gbowleb; between the two we might get at the truth,—
if anyone cares to hear it, which we very much doubt.
Open House deserves a word or two more than we can give it this
week. Jack Alabaster is the most suitable part Mr. Thomas Thorne
has had for some time. The dialogue is purely H. J. Byronic when
he got into the punning vein, for there is much in it which, had it
been in doggerel couplets, would hay* been excellent, matter for bur-
lesque. It is a weak story not particularly well constructed, with
stagey devices, and seems to be rather the first farcical suggestions
towards making a comedy than even a highly-finished farcical comedy.
The Banquet given to Mr. Henby Ibvehs, on his return from
America, was a big success for Messrs. Spiebs and Pond. It was,
for a large publio dinner,—and anathemas on all large public dinners
say we,—very good and well served. But why a dinner? Why not
"A. Warm Reception," with smoking allowed, and commencing
about ten o'clock. All the friends and admirers could come and do
the shake-hand business, and unite in what the French term a
"punch" in honour of the Quest of the Evening—a phrase that
reminds me of the old song onoe popular, "Beautiful Star," which,
by someone with, a turn that way, and time to do it, might be
parodied thus—
"Quest of the Evening,
Beautiful! Beautiful Guest!"

Her segis Pallas o'er his shoulder throws:

With her own shout great Pallas swells the sound,

OUR BOOKING OFFICE.
Oa the Stage—and Off, published by Messrs. Field and Tuek,
is amusingly written, and will be found both interesting and in-
structive by those who think of taking to the Stage as a profession.
It does not profess to give the manners and customs behind the
Scenes at the first-class West-End Theatres, for to these the Author
never seems to have attained; but as he writes simply as an out-
sider, without any theatrical influence to assist him in obtaining an
engagement, his experiences are most useful to the majority of those
who think they will make their living by the Stage, and who have
simply to go to an Agent's, and put their names down on his books
inst as a Tutor, or Governess, or Servant in want of employment,
has to go to an Agency to put his or her name down, ana take the
chance of what may turn up. As to the Advertisements which
from time to time appear in the Theatrical Trade-journal, he says:—
"It can hardly improve the reputation of the profession in the eyes of the
public, when they read advertisement after advertisement, ending with such
lines as, ' None but sober people need apply.' 1 Must contrive to keep sober,
at all events during the performance.' 'People who are constantly getting
drunk need not write.'"
We believe that the failing which rendered suoh advertisements
necessary is fast disappearing. The work is evidently written by one
who has suffered, and it somewhat reminds us of the " Letters by a
Young Gentleman of Fashion, who had recently gone on the Stage,"
which appeared in Mr. Punch's pages, and which were intended as a
warning to those meditating the same step, not against taking it, but
against doing so hastily and without most careful consideration.
When writing naturally, the Author's style is bright and pleasant;
but he evidently prides himself on an occasional sentimental effect,
which has a strong smell of the footlights about it. What Sir Peter
at the close of that memorable interview said to Joseph Surface we
say to the Author of On the Stage—and Off. Otherwise, we heartily
welcome the little work, and recommend its perusal to another
I anonymous Author—the gentleman who wrote Obiter Dicta.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, April 27.—Grand Old Man
made one of his grandest old. speeches to-night. Vote of Credit
oame on on Motion to go into Committee. House crowded from floor
to ceiling. Expected that announcement of Peace or War was on the
lips of the Premier as he sat on Treasury Bench waiting to begin.
Meanwhile, House, tied and bound by its own regulations, compelled
to listen to Arthur O'Connob whilst he learnedly expatiated on the
technicalities of moving Votes of Credit. As a rule when O'Connor
gets up Members get up too and leave the House. To-night, with
rare luxury of full benches, cannot be blamed if he made the most of
his opportunity. Till he'd finished Gladstone couldn't begin.
Might finish any moment, so Members sat and waited, if they did not
listen. Hartington explained practical bearings oi situation, and
affair supposed to be over. House saw, with low moans of despair,
Chaplin, Abihub Balpoub, W. Fowler and W. H. Smith rise in
.melancholy succession. Now surely here's the end.
A full nonr already wasted in discussion of procedure, w
Gladstone sits waiting to deliver his momentous message. Conver-
sation might have ended with ,W. H. Smith. But a ponderous
figure moved on the Treasury Bench, a profoundly wise countenance
gleamed over the crowded benches, and a deep familiar voice was
heard distilling words of counsel and reproof. It was Habcoubt—
actually Habcoubt!
"Bet you two to one Harcourt makes this thing, just finishing,
last another hour," said James Lowtheb, seeing a sudden opening
for business. "Do it in ponies P"
"I've given up riding," said J. G. Talbot, whom Jambs
addressed. Pity for Talbot that betting's out of his line. James
was just near enough to lose. Haecourt succeeded in bringing
about a further waste of fifty-five minutes, after which Gladstone
got to work, and delivered speech worthy of the historio occasion.
Conservatives had intended to at least raise debate. But yielding
to enthusiasm that throbbed through the House when Premier sat
down, they refrained, and Vote of Credit carried by acclamation.
Civil Service Estimates after this. Irish Members took the oppor-
tunity of making an attaok upon the system of appointing Committee
Clerks. Great desire to hear J. Redmond on this subject. But he
sat silent and contemplative.
"They're a clever lot, after all, the boys," said Sir Pat O'Brien,
Eazing upon them with a certain fondness. "This is the way they
ave little goes at each other without the appearance of striking.
They don't forget John Redmond was a Committee Clerk before
Parnell found him an opportunity of filling a position where be can
avenge years of servitude by safely insulting the Speaker. Don't
go for him openly, but seize opportunity in Supply to make out that
Committee Clerks are body ot ne'er-do-weels pitchforked into com-
fortable berths by grossest favouritism. It's very clever. But I Jd
like John Redmond better if he'd had the courage to say something in
favour of his old pals." Business done.—Vote of Credit agreed to.
Tuesday.—Always say House of Commons best business Assembly
in the world. More than ever convinced to-night. Spent night
after night in Committee, debating and dividing on particular points
in Seats Bill—Buch, for example, as, whether City of London should
have four Members or two, and whether Pembroke and Haverford-
west should be united. Thought these points generally settled. But
Rules provide that, on Report stage of any Bill, questions debated in
Committee may ibe all gone over again. Haverfordwest question
remarkable for bringing out Wllliam Da vies, Member for county,
a mute inglorious Davles hitherto, but now moved to passionate
eloquence by Gobst, who, in unguarded moment, refers to Haverford-
west as a Welsh town.
"Haverfordwest," said the indignant D., "is a purely English
town ;" at which Members well up on the Frontier question laugh.
"Why," cried the increasingly indignant D., in unmistakeable
Welsh accent, " I was born in it 1"
That ought to have settled the question—but didn't Members
roared with laughter. Doubts of their general sanity disturb
Davies's mind. Begins to wish he was safe baok in Haverfordwest,
which he proceeded confidentially to inform Committee is "a large
town, with a small population."
Business done.—Seats Bill re-argued on Report.
Wednesday. — Found Randolph in low spirits this afternoon.
"No, Toby, it's nothing to do with domestic troubles. Woolfft is
as affectionately docile as ever. Gobst and I have quite made up
the little tiff whioh disturbed the serenity of our Party before I went
to India, and Arthur Balfoub has joined us again for the ninth
time. We are a united and resolute Party, we are we are. What
troubles me is the necessity for 'saying things' about my respeoted
Leaders. Had to do it this afternoon. Understand they didn't like
it; but their feeling nothing to the anguish I suffer."
fif Unite true. I Randolph had another go at his respeoted Leaders on
Seats Bill, protesting against their right to settle matters in con-
ference with Ministers. Stafford Nohthcote meekly explains,
speaking of himself and Gentlemen on the Front Benon as repre-
sentatives of the Opposition.^." I will not," he added, "in presence
of the noble Lord, call them ' Leaders.'"
This mollified Randolph, but what he regrets is the necessity for
having from time to time publicly to reprove them.
"The only way I see out of the difficulty," says J. G. Talbot, a
man of peace, "is for us to quit Front Opposition Bench, and let
Randolph fill it." Business done.—More rediscussion of Questions
settled in Committee on Seats Bill.
_ Thursday.—W. E. G. provided genuine sensation for House to-
night. Just after questions were over, Premier discovered walking
down the floor of the House, clad in white sheet, with a candle in
right hand. "Peccavi! Peccavi!" he cried, as he slowly paced
the floor. Arrived at the table, he asked permission to refer to his
speech of Monday night, when ne had, as he said, "introduced
references of a highly polemical and controversial charaoter with
regard to the proceedings on the Vote of Credit in 1878." Premier
pleaded that he had. .not. meant to do this. He had been led by cir-
cumstances to which he said he need not refer; though here he oast
a glance towards the corner seat below the Gangway opposite, whioh
brought a blush to the ingenuous face of its occupant.
"I was rather in a funk for a moment, I can tell you, Toby,"
Randolph said, afterwards. "Thought the Old Man was going to
peach. Of course everybody knew I was 'the circumstanoe' tnat
led him into this piokle. I interrupted on Monday with reference to
1878, and, as usual, he exploded like a can of dynamite. But he
wouldn't let on about me. Was half inclined, when he sat down, to
borrow the sheet, and what was left of the candle, frankly own up,
and exonerate the old boy. Whilst I was thinking it over, Speaker
called on Orders of the Day, and it was too late."
Gladstone's apology a great suocess. Conservatives handsomely
cheered him. Northcote, almost blubbering, shook hands with him
across table, and there was a momentary Millennium.
Chlldbbs brings in Budget. Always a little self-important—
H-ere C-omes E-verybody Childbbs, as Gibson fills up his initials.
To-night bursting with importance and a deficit of Fifteen Millions.
"The biggest defioit," he tells the House, "since Crimean War." Will
hardly speak to Gladstone, who never had. a deficit at all. Only
just notices Northcote, who has done pretty well in this line, but
never came up to Fifteen Millions.
"Really don't know what we shall do with Chtlders now," Dllxb
says, with a sigh. "He's that stuck up aB to be quite unbearable.
Wish we could get him away for a week or two, till he's simmered
down."
House in highest good-humour, though not quite so respectful to
Child ers as he imagines it should be. Even laughs and cheers
when he mentions deficit. But, on the whole, reception favourable.
"A curious people this," muttered M. db Lessab, looking down
on the scene from the Distinguished Strangers' Gallery. "They
have to provide over a Hundred Millions sterling for twelve months'
expenditure, and they laugh and joke and chaff the good old pompous
Chlldbbs as if someone else had to find the money. They couldn't
possibly be in higher spirits if the deficit of Fifteen Millions were a
surplus in hand. It is very droll."
Business done.—Budget brought in.
Friday.—Markiss tried another fall with Redesdale and was
heavily thrown. Engagement took place on Northfleet Docks Bill.
Been thrown out on technical breach of Standing Orders, which the
Markiss thinks might be condoned. Redesdale thinks not. The
Markiss fumes, but Redesdale firm as a rook, and Markiss retires
discomfited. "Odd thing," he muttered, between olenohed teeth.
"Can face Granville, and have baffled Gladstone, but always
beaten by this wooden figure-head."
Business done.—Irish Registration^ Bill through Committee in
Co:
Latest from Borne.
"Thebe's been an English Pope," said one of the Irish Bishops to
a distinguished Cardinal; "but there's never been an Irish one."
"Yet," observed his Eminence, thoughtfully, "there ought to
have been. In no nationality could there be found a more fitting
representative of the Papacy than among the Irish."
"We 're flattered by Your Eminence's opinion," replied the
Bishop; "but on what does Your Eminence, as an Englishman,

alleged to have been effected in the episco-
pacy of the Established Church, the Timet
observes that:—
"This change may be variously explained, but
so far as it has been due to any one man, it is
Bishop Wilberforce who must hare the credit
for it.*'
And this great episcopal Reformer was in
his lifetime a character of notoriety ex-
pressed by the nickname of " Soapt 8am "!

THE MEMBER EOR THE STRAND.

T is no less strange than true that,
ever since I was a boy,
When my parents looked upon me
as their only pride and joy,
It has been my sole ambition, of my
mind the single bent
An especial London Distriot in the
House to represent.
Heaven bless Redistribution I It
entitles me to hope
That my legislative talent soon will
find its proper scope;
For no sooner shall the Bill come
into force than I will stand
On the hustings for election as the
Member for the Strand!
What a distriot! Bnt what difficult
constituents to serve I
Could I think that from such voters
my fidelity could swerve,
Or that with their lightest wishes I
to trifle could attempt,
I should certainly regard myself with something like contempt.

And the modish Saint of Hanover (not Georgy of the East)

I AH INSTRUCTED TO REFUSE MY CONSENT.
"I ah afraid, Mr. Briefless," said my benevolent-looking
neighbour, helping himself to port, "that you have proved in your
own person the truth of the adage,' There is many a slip betwixt the
cup and the lip.'"
I admitted that certainly in the course of my professional career I
had had many disappointments. I added that I was of a sanguine
temperament, and still hoped some day to have an opportunity of
addressing a Judge with or without a jury.
"So you shall," replied my rosy-oheeked, silver-haired companion,
with a benevolent smile. "I should not be surprised if you did
not have such an opportunity; say, to-morrow."
I was much surprised. Until then I had taken my neighbour
(whose talk had been principally of hunting, fishing, and labourers'
cottages) for a large-hearted country gentleman, the philanthropical
lord of a model manor. When we had joined the ladies I asked our
host who he was?
"Not know?" was the reply, uttered in an incredulous tone.
"Why, my dear bov, it is Mr. Goodfellow, the head of the eminent
firm of Solicitors. I thought that you would like to meet him."
Like to meet him! Why it had been the dearest ambition of my
life! And here I had spent the precious minutes between the
appearance of the claret and the disappearance of the coffee in
relating adventures dealing rather with the disappointments than
the successes of a life spent at the Bar. Be it clearly understood
that had. I known who my neighbour was, I should not have, of
course, in any way attempted to influence him directly. I would
merely have striven to create a favourable impression, and perhaps
have related an anecdote or two suggestive of my extensive practice
and legal acumen. As it was, I had told him a number of stories,
in which I had figured invariably as a discomfited hero. This is a
bad habit of mine which my wile continually attempts to suppress,
pointing out to me that I cannot hope to get work in a grave sober
if I turn myself into ridicule. This is a view, however, I
cannot take of the subject, as I point out to her that, however un-
fortunate, disappointed, nay, even heart-broken I may be, I am
never ridiculous. Still I would have been better pleased had I kept
my tongue under greater control, and left many of my sayings
unsaid. As for Mr. Goodfellow, he had been a capital audience,
and had laughed heartily at all my autobiographical reminiscences.
My friends generally do laugh at my autobiographical reminiscences
—I do not. Shortly afterwards the guests departed, and I saw
no more of my neighbour.
On the following morning on entering my Chambers, my excellent
and admirable Clerk gave me a paper with the observation that he
supposed he had better enter it in the Fee Book.
The Fee Book!" I exclaimed, in joyous tones. "Why,
PoErLTOTON, you surely do not mean to say"
"Yes, Sir, it is," replied my excellent and admirable Clerk.
"But it is only a Consent Brief, sent you as a compliment, I imagine,
as all you will have to do, Sir, is to say you appear for the Defendant
and consent—that's to say, Sir, if you take the trouble to turn up."
"I am surprised at you, Fobtington," I observed, severely.
"When have you known me to neglect the interest of my clients?
'Take the trouble to appear,' I shall give the matter my very best
attention."
On examination I found that the Brief had been sent me by Mr.
Goodfellow, and was more than gratified to discover that I had
evidently, in spite of my autobiographical reminiscences, not
forfeited his respect.
I was soon robed and in the Division in which I had to give my
consent. The Court was very crowded, and I therefore had to take
one of the back seats devoted to the Bar. I looked at my papers, or
rather paper, and found that my acquiescence was desired to a
decree consisting of about a dozen paragraphs. This ceremony was
to be performed during the hearing of a "short cause" known as
"Re Tompkins, Black versus White." While I was attempting to
discover whether I appeared for Black or White, and who on earth
was Tompkins, two gentlemen approached me hurriedly. To my
knowledge, I had seen neither of them before.
"Mr. Briefless," said one of them, excitedly, in an undertone,

for the business of the Court was going on, and only whispering was
possible, "I am instructing you, and, as new matter has been intro-
duced, I am afraid we cannot consent."
"I think you should," replied the other, with equal excitement,
"for yon see your concession cannot injure the remainder-men."
"On, yon think not?" I observed, not exactly understanding what
it was all about, but merely to keep the ball roiling.
Then the two turned round on one another, and had a long and
angry altercation, in which I occasionally caught the words
"cestuiqne trusts, "oo-parceners," " borough English," and " base
fee." From this I gathered that "Re Tompkmt, Black versus
White" must be a suit not altogether without complications. At
length the gentleman who was instructing me, appealed to me.
Of course, deferring to you, Sir, I do not see it is safe to con-
sent." he said, and I gave him an approbatory nod.
"Not even if we waive the right of detainer in the oopyhold
matter ?" urged the other, with almost painful earnestness.
"I am afraid we cannot go as far as that," replied my Client,
more in sorrow than in anger, and he appealed to me.
"Certainly not," I replied, in accents of regretful determination.
"I do not see how we can consent."
"I thought you would agree with me, Sir," responded my Client,
in a tone suggestive of a kind-hearted warrior gloomily announcing
a victory which had oost both sides fearful and irreparable losses.
The representative of the other side bowed his head in mournful
resignation, and left us. He had scarcely gone before I heard the
Judge saying something about "Tompkins." His Lordship was
apparently having a long confidential chat with a Queen's Counsel,
who seemed to be explaining something to him of an intricate
character. The Judge smiled now and then, as if he were saying.
"Come, you are going a little too far, I can't allow you to do that!
I craned forward to hear what it was all about, but could not succeed
in gathering much, as two elderly juniors (whose ages united would
have amounted to something over one hundred and twenty) were
talking in a loud undertone about the superiority of Portuguese over
Egypts as an investment. "Where have we got to?" 1 asked one
of the disputants, with the Freemasonry of the Bar.
"Re Tompkins, Black versus White. You see, Portuguese, although
rather low at present, for years have averaged fifty," was the answer.
As I imagined I The Judge wai hearing our case. At this
moment his Lordship who had found something or other urged by
the Q.C. " too much, smilingly shook his head and caught my eye.
I smiled in response, and also shook my head, wishing to give him
my support. The Judge seemed much astonished and even angered
at this demonstration. He returned to his chat with the Q.C, drop-
ping his voice to an even more confidential tone than he had hitherto
adopted, as if he were resenting my interference as that of an eaves-
dropper who had forced himself into a matter of purely private
interest to parties other than himself. This so nettled me, that, to
my own surprise, I found myself actually on my feet, and speaking.

"The Refused Consent.
(Design for a Historical Cartoon, by a very Junior Member of the Briefless
Family.)
_ "My Lord I " I exclaimed, with the voice and attitude of an accu-
sing spirit, " I appear for the Defendants, and 1 cannot consent!"
I was perfectly frightened at the effect of this announcement.
Had the Court been blown up with dynamite, I do not think that
the Judge and Q.C. could have been more surprised. The latter
turned round to me in an appealing manner, and urged, with tears
in his eves, that I should oonsent, offering to give up something
extremely technical (and which 1 did not in the least understand) as
a reward for my concession. 8o impassioned was the entreaty, that
I was on the point of granting the counsel's request, when my Client
whispered, with muoh agitation, "No!"
"lam instructed that 1 cannot consent," 1 replied, with a dignity
that must have been extremely impressive. The tone would nave
been equally fitting to one of the Council of Ten calmly ordering a
trembling malefactor to the torture-ohamber.
The Q.C. sank down into his seat the picture of despair, while his
junior threw a glance at me such as might have been expected from
the weeping widow of a warrior looking through her tears at his
conqueror. The Judge, at first a little astonished, as if he had been
a Privy Councillor suddenly caught in the act of robbing a jam closet
by his Sovereign, soon regained his composure, and, so to speak,
pulled himself together. He showed by his demeanour that he was
determined, having happily regained the path of virtue from whioh
he had been seduced for a moment, never again to leave it.
"I was under the impression when this matter was brought before
me." he said, with grave displeasure, "that all the parties interested
had given their consent."
The almost weeping Q.C. looked up from the depths of his desk
imploringly, as if entreating, on account of a long and arduous
career hitherto blameless, for consideration, for meroy.
"I find now," his Lordship continued, indignantly, "that I mis-
understood the situation. This being so, I must revise the order 1
was about to make ab initio."^
And then his Lordship delivered himself of a harangue spoken in
a loud voioe and addressed to mo personally, as if appealing to me
for endorsement, whioh was simply harrowing in its effect on the
other side. The poor Q.C. absolutely writhed in his agony as tech-
nical point after technical point was apparently decided against him.
I say apparently," because I frankly admit that I did not in the
least understand what it was all about, and confined myself to bow-
ing graciously now and then to the J udge, as if to assure his Lord-
ship that he was doing his work capitally, with my entire approval,
and that, in point of fact, had I tried, I could not have done it better
myself. The Judge concluded by complimenting me personally upon
having persuaded my clients to sacrifice their own interests in the
cause of equity and j ustice. I was rather surprised at this, but very
pleased with the general result, and left the Court to receive the
congratulations of those who had instructed me. On reaching the
corridor 1 found a fearful row going on. The Clerk who had sat
behind me, and who had disappeared in the middle of his Lordship's
argument, was having a terrible altercation with another gentleman
from the same office. I smilingly approaohed them.
"Well, I think that was managed very nicely," I observed, with
a modesty that I intended should be appreciated—I could afford to
be Bportive after my triumph.
"Nicely!" said the new-comer, turning upon me like a tiger.
"Why, Sir, didn't you observe that the firm must have had two
cases before the Court, and that we were opposing the wrong one?"
"What!" I cried, absolutely aghast with horror, "do you mean
to say that I ought not to have refused my consent!"
"Certainly," was the immediate and very angry answer. "And
I hope you will forgive 'me for saying it, Sir, but we do expect
Counsel to show tome discretion, and see at a glance when a very
patent mistake has arisen."
This was my first and last brief from Goodfellow's!

DEAR ChARLIK,
'Ow are yer, old Turmnts P Gone mouldy, or moon-strnok, or wot P
Sticking down in the Country, like you do, I tell yer, is all tommy-rot.
It's Town makes a man of one, Charlie, as me and the Nobs 'as found out,
And a Snide 'ub. like you should be fly to it. Carn't fanoy wot you 're about.
Old Rtrssm, I know, sez quite t'other, but then he is clean off his ohump.
Where's the Life in long lanes with no gas-lamps? Their smell always gives
me the 'amp.
Come hout on it, Mate, it '11 spile yer. It's May, and the Season's begun,
All the Toffs is in Town—ah! you trust 'em! they know where to drop on the fun.
Don't ketch them a-Maying, my pippin, like bloomin' old Jaoks-in-the-Green,
A-sloppin' about in damp medders, with never a Pub to be seen.
No fear! We've primroses in tons—thanks to Beakey—for them as can pay.
And all other larks as is larks, mate, they know meet in London in May.
It is all very well, on a Sunday, for jest arf a dozen or so
To take a chay-cart down to Epsom, and cut down the May as yer go.
I've 'ad 'igh old times on that lay, Charlie, gals, don't yer know, and all that,
Returning at dusk with the beer on, and May branohes aU round yer 'at.
With plenty of tuppenny smokes and 'am sanwiches, Charlie, old man,
And a bit of good goods in pink musling, it ain't arf a bad sort o' plan.
Concertina, in course, and tin whistle, to give 'em a rouser all round,
And " Chorus" all over the shop, till the winders'11 shake at the sound.
That's " May, merry May," if yer like, mate, and does yours anoetrar a treat.
But the Rural's a dose as wants mixing, it won't do to swaller it neat;
That's wy the Haristos and 'Arrt, and all as is fly to wot's wot,
Likes passing the Season in London, in spite of yer poetry rot.
Country's all jolly fine in the Autumn, with plenty of killing about,—
Day's rabbin in's not a had barney, and gull-potting's lummy, no doubt;
But green fields with nothink to slorter, no pubs, no theaytres, no gas!—
No, no, it won't wash, and the muggins as tells yer it will is a hass.
But May in " the Village," my biffin, the Mighty Metrolopus,—ah!
That's Paradise, Sir, and no kid, with a dash o' the true lah-di-dah.
Covent Garden licks Eden, I reckon, at least it '11 do me A 1;
Button-'oler and Bond Street, old pal, that's yer fair top-row sarmple for fun!
Wy, we git all the best of the Country in London, with dollups chunked in.
Hush m herby !—ascuse the Hitaliau!—Ah, mate, ony wish I'd the tin;
I'd take 'em a trot, and no flounders! It's 'ard, bloomin' 'ard, my dear boy,
When Form as is Form ain't no fling, as a German ud Bay, fo der quoy.
I'i make Mister Rusetw sit up, and the rest of the 'owlers see snakes,
With their rot about old Mother Nature, as never don't make no mistakes.
Yah! Nature's a fraud and a fizzle, that is if yer oan't fake her out
With the taste of a Man about Town, ony sort as knows wot he's about.
Well, London's all yum-yum jest now. Hezhibitions all hover the shop,
I tell yer it keeps one a movin . I'm on the perpetual 'op,
Like the Prince. Aitch har aitch it a stayer, a fair Royal Rowell, I say.
(I landed a quid on that " Mix," but I carat git the beggar to pay.)
"Inventories" open, you know. Rayther dry, but the Extrys 0. K.
It's the Extrys, I 'old, make up life, arf the pleasure and most o' the pay.
Yus, Princes, and Painters, Philanterpists, Premiers and Patriots may gush,
But wot ud beoome of their Shows if it weren't for the larks and the lush P
Lor bless yer, dear boy, Pioter Galleries, Balls, Sandwioh Sworries and all,—
It's fun and the fizz makes 'em go, not the pioter, the speech, or the squall.
Xeep yer eve on the Buffet's my maxim, look out for the "jam " and the laugh,
And you'll collar the pick o' the basket, the rest is all sordust and chaff.
That 's philosophy, Charlie, my pippin; the parsons and prigs may demur,

QUITE A NEW LINE OF ITS OWN.
(Suakin to Berber. Official Report.)
Thr first half-yearly meeting of this now flourishing little line was held
yesterday inside the Company's temporary Zareba, hastily thrown up for the
purpose at Ocao. and was largely attended by "friendly" and other share-
holders interested in the success of the undertaking. Upon the Chairman, who
was fully armed and prepared for any emergency that might arise during the
reading of the report, taking his place, a few falling shots from the adjacent
- rub, apparently aimed at the outgoing Director*, created some slight momentary
excitement, which, however, speedily quieted down on the not altogether
unexoected announcement being made that neither the Ordinary Preferenoe,
nor Debenture Stock holders would anyone of them receive any dividend what-
ever.
The fact, the Chairman proceeded to point out, was not one that need dis-
oourage those who had embarked their capital in the concern, inasmuch as the
line had, during the past quarter, been worked under singular disadvantages.
vol. EXXXTUX, z
The continual blowing-up of the permanent way, and
shelling of the stations, signal-boxes, and rolling stock,
had greatly added to the item of "Expenditure," while
the rtceipte from the passenger traffio, he regretted to
add, had, unfortunately, to be set down as nil This was
partly owing, no doubt, to the untoward oircumstanee
that the very first excursion train of the season was cap-
tured in a cutting near Eobak, and sold with its contents
then and there into slavery
This had destroyed confidence in the regular working
of the line, while the faot that the one season-ticket
holder, an Arab Gentleman residing in Eordofan, was
believed on several oocasions to have murdered all the
Guards, Stokers, and Engine-drivers, for the sake of
securing the coal and stuffing of the carriage-seats, and
oarrying it all off on camels, purposely concealed in a
secluded siding, did not lead the Directors to anticipate
any very substantial increase in their profits in this
direction. He was, at the Bame time, happy to state
that the appearance of two new Mahdis in the neigh-
bourhood of Berber, led him confidently to look for a
large temporary up-traffio of homeless fugitives in the
coming Autumn. On the whole, the Balance-Sheet was
not all he would wish to see it; but he thought he might
honestly say that there were many enoouraging features
about it. After a rather stormy protest from an armed
minority, which was, however, allayed by the getting
into position of two Gatlings, the report was unanimously
adopted. _______

OUR COPY OF THE INVENTORIES.
First Landing. Initial Impressions.
w Monojfor the latest growth of the (Somers) Vine at South Kensington, "Always the same."
It may be taken as an established fact that the Fisheries and Healtheries were very much
alike—especially the Inventories." However, there is one notable alteration for the better—
the improved approach. The Subway from the South Kensington Station to the entrance in
the Exhibition Road has swept away the army in single file of ragamuffins that used to be
drawn up last year opposite the palings to the Gardens of the Natural History Museum. We
begin to love Subways, and perfectly adore Blow-holes, which are things of beauty, and joys
for evert But for the rest, this and any other like display might be aptly called "The
Advertisementaries." Perhaps the decorations of the Hall are in better taste than those of
1884. The splendid pictures illustrating the advantages of "Somebody's Furs," and " Some-
body else's Washable Wall-papers," have been painted over, and on this occasion we have
frescoes of the Progress of Soienoe and Art. Some clever draughtsman has depicted side
by" side the modern time and "Ye Olden
Days." For instance, we have a nineteenth
century watch-manufactory and a mediaeval
clockmaker's, a bridge designed by Da. Vnrci
and the most recent triumph of American
Extension Architecture, a steamboat of the
last century and an ocean mail of the pre-
sent. But these frescoes in many cases
create a false impression, by suggesting
that, on the whole, invention in_ the past
was more picturesque and ingenious than
invention in the present. This is particularly
the case in the tableaux devoted to iron-
beating, where the old-fashioned hammer
looks infinitely more imposing than "the
Bessemer process." As of old the magni-
ficent equestrian statue of the Heir-Apparent
to the British Throne is stationed in the
centre, the effigy suggesting by its attitude
that it is the favourite occupation of H.R.H.
to gallop recklessly through a number of
hot-house plants.
Item.—Isn't it rather a slight to those
popular caterers Messrs. Spikes aktj Poktj
to make H.R.H. cantering away from " the
Club Dinner?" H.R.H. cantering while
they 're catering and de-cantering!
Another old friend was the Opening
Ceremony."
On the occasion of the Fisheries two years
ago, many of the officials startled an unpre-
pared world by appearing in the most
magnificent uniforms. One gentleman as-
sumed the Field Marshallike garb of a
Deputy Lieutenant, while another (con-
nected with the Literary Department)
suggested, by his "get up," that, at some
time or other, he must- have been in the
Cabinet of a Foreign Government. On the
present occasion "morning dress" was de
rigueur, and the sight, consequently, was
not nearly so impressive. It is better, at
all events, than coining in "night dress"
—no, we should say "evening dress," only
night is the antithesis of morning—but not
so imposing. The Committee selected the
Conservatory for the function, no doubt
with the intention of developing the idea
(suggested by the position of the statue in
the Entrance Hall), that the Prince of Wales
has an unreasoning devotion to hothouse
plants.
The time of weary waiting before the
arrival of the Royal party was amusingly
filled up by a variation of the pastime of
"the Derby Dog." A Potentate, in an
elaborate turban, who, no doubt, had the
scene been laid in his own country, would
have ordered the entire Assembly to be then
and there beheaded, was kept knocking
about, trving to find a seat. For some ten
minutes he was utterly ignored by every-
one, being very properly regarded as "a
Nigger, from somewhere or other." Ren-
dered reckless by this neglect, the unhappy
Potentate ventured to take a chair hypothe-
cated to a " Member of the Press." He was
instantly ignominiously ejected, and was
unceremoniously hustled hither and thither,
until recognised by some one "who knew
him at home," when he was hurriedly fur-
nished with a golden chair, and introduced
to the Prinoe of Waxes. Beyond this pleas-
ing interlude, the opening ceremony pre-
sented no variation from the inauguration
of the Fisheries. Sir Frederick Beajtweu
read a long and varied Advertisement to the
Prince, who expressed his joy at the intel-
ligence thus oonveyed to him. This done, |
and the Building was declared free to the
Public—at a fee of a nhilling or half a
crown.

With books close-packed; 'tis full of solemn graces
And redolent of pure and peaceful lore.

technically, "heard without."
In comes Mr. Maas as young Det Grieux. From the first all foresee
that his will be a Maasterly performance, and so it proves. His eye

A mere Soup-song.

{Qy. Is he dressed ac-curately f)
lights on Manon!—suoh an eye! "An eye like Maas to threaten or
command "—but in this case to "Maas-h" her. Manon tells him
"_ simply "—so simply, "Believe me I am not wicked. I am on my
way to a convent." But Chevalier Maas the Maasher won't let her
go. "Not from you," says Mr. Bennett, the eminent librettist,
speaking by Mr. Maas, "shall hope and joy he torn," And the
simple Manon, who is so very simple that she is travelling all alone,
literally jumps at the young and utter stranger's offer—oh, the
stranger is too utter!—to take her to Paris,—they are at Amiens,
and it's a pretty far ory to Paris,—and in view of the pleasant drive
they are to have, the Simple Girl and the Too Utter Stranger sing
together the words of the poet Bennett—
We to Paris will go,
Heart to heart!
And, though fortune may frown,
Never part!
He will have to "part" when he gets to Paris, as, particularly
should "fortune frown," the pair of them cannot live there for
nothing. However, the Simple Maiden and Chevalier Maasher console
themselves by citing Bennett on the situation—
Evermore bliss is ours!
With Love's sweetest flowers
Will we crown the bright hours.
Hooray for Bennett! Down with Browning! Tenntson no-
where! Of suoh charming lyrics as these it oan only be said, in the
most complimentary fashion, that "they couldn't be better and
might be verse."
More laughter in the Inn. Mr. Ltall has tried to tell them
another of his droll stories, in whioh he has been cruelly interrupted
by the applause consequent on the duett about going to Paris above
mentioned. So the Simple Maiden Manon goes off with the Chevalier
Maasher, and everybody assaults Mr. Ltall for no particular rearon,
except to bring down the Curtain on something like a bustling
situation.
ACT II.—The Simple Maiden and the Maashing Chevalier in Paris.
By the way, there appears to be a little doubt as to the proper
pronunciation of the Mashing One's title. Some call him Shiver-leer;
others, Shever-iee-ay, but I fanoy that " Shiver-leer" seems to be
the more popular. Manon reads a letter " with simplicity," vide
eminent librettist's stage-direction, and this letter-duett is one of
the successes of the evening. In their intense simplicity the Maiden
and the Maasher talk to eaoh other like this:—" Thou desirest it P"
asks Manon. "Those flowers are very beautiful," observes the
jealous Maasher, "who gave them to thee?" "I do not know,"
replies the Simple Maiden. "What!" exclaims the Buspioious
Maasher, "thou dost not know!" "I hope thou art not jealous."
"Thou art right." And so on. I shrewdly suspect that the poet
Bennett meaut this thee-ing and thou-ing to be a conscientious
reproduction of the French familiar <utov-ing. Perhaps so, only in
English it makes the Maasher and the Maiden talk like a couple of
old-fashioned Quakers.
Then comes a fine dramatio quartette. Lescaut and the seductive
De Britvgny having retired, a servant brings in the simple supper
for the simple couple, which consists, apparently, of a huge jug and
basin off the washing-stand: though subsequently it is made partly
clear that if the big jug comes from the washing-stand, the basin is
intended for soup, and Manon, being all alone, sings a song to the
potage and the table. Clearly a most idyllic situation. The jealous
Shiver-leer returns, but, though she helps him to soup, he will sing-
he is so full of soup-<;ons—and won't eat. Then he hears a knock at
the door, and, on going to answer, the unfortunate Shiver-leery
Maasher is gagged, and bound, and taken off; while Manon, over-
come with grief, says " He has gone!" and probably sends the soup
down to be warmed up again, so that she may enjoy herself quietly.
Or, being fond of a bit of fun, and taking things philosophically, she
may perhaps put on her bonnet, and go out to sup with De Britigny
at the Cafi Anglais of that period.
ACT III.—Praise to Mr. Augustus Harris. Chorus in Ms
honour. "What a charming promenade! Oh how happy are we 1"
Everyone enjoying themselves when Mr. Ltall appears. His
acquaintance who heard his good stories in Act I. immediately ran
away; they are not going to be let in for any more if they know it
Directly he has gone everyone returns. Then Manon sings the hit
of the evening, tnoored three times. All going pleasantly, when old
Des Grieux, the Maasher's "stem parient," enters. He comes in
with a verv big stick. Everybody gets out of his way. Manon
trembles. Duett between Simple Maiden,—promoted to diamonds,—
and Stern Parient, to gavotte accompaniment. Most effective.
Re-enter Mr. Ltall exoitedly, oharged with another good story, but
his appearance is the immediate signal for another violent assault on
him, and before he can get oat a syllable down comes the Curtain.
Happy Thought (for Stage-Manager).—When in doubt how to end
an Act, or Scene, with something like a situation, bring on Ltall,
and have him hustled. It's not much, but it's better than nothing
at all, and prevents the finish being too flat
Scene 2.—In the Parlour of the Seminary of St. Solpice. _ The

his first trial-trip sermon to a congregation composed exclusively of

Enter Mr. Maasher as a pale Young Curate, as he might appear if

Simple Maiden enters and

claims, "Duty calls me

afterwards it ocours to the
Young Curate that he can
get somebody else to do his
duty, and off he goes with
Manon, chucking up St.

Lescaut bolts, like Mr.

trate, but doesn't turn up again in last Act so funnily, and the
gang is broken up by the Stern Parient getting his son out of the
mess somehow.
Scene 2.—Convict gamblers on their way to the galleys. Maasher
meets Simple Maiden in very reduced circumstances, and the state of
discipline in the Army at this period being as lax as it was in the
Seminary, he bribes the soldiers, who allow mm to interview Manon
all alone, when, as the piece is getting rather long, and there's
nothing for her to do without beginning an entirely new story, the
Simple Maiden simply dies. The Maasher falls down beside her.
whether alive or dead is uncertain, but if the latter, " Villikint and
his Dinah lie buried in one grave." Very satisfactory. They call
the Composer, and Mr. Caul Rosa, steps forward to say the
Composer's away. And once again we congratulate Mr. Rosa on
his pluck and energy, and as Rip Van Winkle says, "May he live
long and brosber."
LAURELS AND LOGIC.
Is it want of understanding, Mr. Punch, in the subjective sense
only, which suggests that the noble Poet Laureate, before his
"Epitaph for Gordon in our Westminster Abbey—i.e., for his
Cenotaph," as below, is finally thereon engraven, might be respect-
fully invited to reconsider its two first lines:—
"Warrior of God, man's friend, not here below,
But somewhere dead far in the Taste Soudan,
Thou livtst in all hearts, for all men know
This earth hath borne no simpler, nobler man."
"Not here below." Is that intended Jto imply " there above "?
So it would seem; for if Gokdon were nowhere, either here or there,
how could he possibly remain a warrior and a friend? Or does it
mean that he is no longer living here below, but lying dead some-
where else than just here, somewhere "far in the waste Soudan,"
although, in a higher situation, he continues to live? At that rate
he, the individual man, would be both living and dead at the same
time—which how could he if, as an individual, indivisible, one, and
not two? No doubt Gokdon lives "in all hearts,"in a sense: but
still that, in so far as it is living in any sense at all, is living here
below."
The foregoing queries may be simply the interrogations of a
Philistine [out, Philistines being numerous, good Lord Tennyson
would perhaps be well advised to concede some indulgence to their
requirement of perspicuity. I hazard this hypothesis under all due
influence of the doubt, if there be any, that I am, yours truly,

THE UNDERGRADE VOTE.
Monday Morning,— Can't imagine why the Master was so unu-
sually polite to me just now. Didn't say a word about my numerous
absences from chapel! Looked on, quite pleased, while Crib (my
terrier) was rooting up the grass in the Quadrangle. This urbanity
suspicious. Is he going to rusticate me, I wonder P
10 a.m.—Morning paper. Everything explained I There's to be
an immediate Eleotion. The Master's a true-blue old Tory, and his
relative, the Hon. Tracy de Beauvoir, is to stand. Lucky I thought
of getting my name put on the Register.
Keening.—Cut all the Morning Lectures on strength of the news,
and hunted with the Drag. Sent for by the Dean. Threatens to
report me to Master. I tell him " I think the Master's too much
occupied with electoral matters at present to have time to attend to
me "—and wink. Dean offended. Doesn't "gate" me this time,
however.
Tuesday.—Proctoriaed again last night! Coming home from jolly
wine-party at John's. Up a lamp-post, trying to light cigar.
Awkward! My tenth time this Term. Proctor sure to fine me at
least a bov. Hope he won't "send me down." How the Governor
would kick at that, to be sure I
Have seen the Proctor. Jolly fellow, Proctor. He's Professor of
Sanskrit as well. Didn't mention last night's escapade at all. Said
"he'd always wished to make my acquaintance." Thought he was
chaffing me. Told him he had made my acquaintance once or twice
before. He laughed, and said that was "in his official capacity."
Asked me what I thought of the betting for the Two Thousand.
Didn't know a Proctor could be so nice. Wonder if he'd come to one
of my wines?
Wednesday,—Meet Master again. All smiles. Asks after "my
pretty little dog," and tries to pat him. Crib flies at his calves.
Master looks frightened, and calls him, soothingly, a "dear little
thing." Shall I tell him I've been to the Proctor? I will.
Master " is sorry to hear it." I assure him I only went to him
"as a friend." Master frowns, and says that makes it worse. Tells
me "Proctor is standing in Radioal interest!" Adds, that "he
hopes none of the Gentlemen in his College will cultivate the
acquaintance of the Radical Proctor, either in his official or unofficial
capacity." Right man to vote for—he says—is, undoubtedly, "the
Hon. Tract de Beauvoir, the Constitutional Candidate."
Happy Idea.—Tell the Master "I am quite undecided how to
vote, and ask him if I could be spared from Lectures to-morrow, as
I want to go to Town "to see my dootor." To-morrow's the Two
Thousand l Don't tell the Master that, however.
Master assents like a lamb. Always before has refused to let me
off in Term-time. What a blessing an Eleotion is! Really, that
Irish fellow who got us the Vote ought to be made Prime Minister.
Friday,—Back from the Two Thousand. Feel queer. Travelling
upsets me, I think. Dean sends to ask "why I was away from
Hall" yesterday evening. Refer him to Master for all explanations.
Young brother comes up to-day from Harrow for Matrio. Fright-
ful young dunce. Give him a tip—tell him to put "strong con-
stitutional principles" in his answers to History Paper. He does so.
Master delighted; says his "Latin Prose is weak, but bis History
admirable." Gives him one or two copies of the Hon. Tract 8
Election Address to distribute. Master has become quite an Elec-
tioneering Agent. Find he has invited Head-Masters of Public
Schools to send up "young men with Constitutional opinions" as
candidates for Matriculation. Promises them rooms in College, and
"immediate prospect of utilising their electoral privileges." Query,
isn't this corruption P
Afternoon.—Find Dean's a strong Radical! Hurrah! Go to him
at once, and ask him if I can't get out of gates to-night " to hear
Professor Thingumbob's speech on the Land System at the Corn
Exchange." Dean a little suspicious—asks me my opinion on land-
nationalisation. Tell him I haven't got one, but daresay I should
get one at the meeting.
Master sends his butler for me—curious I Wants me to " dine
with him on Tuesday"—also wants to know if I would mind
"exhibiting a large blue flag from my window (looking out on High)
on day of ElectionP" Take to the idea at once, tell him "I'll
exhibit several," and he appears pleased.
Next Week,—Jolly time 1 Never had so much freedom. Got out
to wine-party every night; not attended a single Lecture 1 "My
coach tells me "I'm going to the dogs." Going to Newmarket to-
morrow, anyhow; dogs after.
Bull-dogs never notice me now! Radical Proctor clever fellow.
Asked me to breakfast, and bet me twenty to one in ponies against
his own chance for Election. Took him at once! Shall certainly
vote against the Hon. Tracy now. Can't afford to lose. Besides.
Radical Proctor jolly fellow. Hang the Hon. Tracy dx Beauvoir!
Have given orders for yellow flags instead of blue ones on Eleotion
Day. Here goes for a general canvass in favour of the Radioal
Proctor!

WANTED-A REASON?
It is said that 8,000 British troops are, at this present moment,
being slowlv scorched to death under the broiling sun of the African
Desert. Why is this P Is it because—
Either the Government has something else to think about;
Or Lord Habtington is waiting for the facts;
Or Lord Wolseley knows thoroughly well what he wants to do
with the surviving remnant next autumn;
Or the Duke of Cambridge is of opinion that, as the troops are
paid to die for their country, there is nothing after all mueh to
grumble at;
Or that tome responsible people in authority are letting things
slide towards a harrowing catastrophe, which, when it happens, will
surely arouse such a storm of indignation through the length and
breadth of the conntry as it has not known for many a day,—though
it will arouse it, like all other popular storms, as usual—too late t
"NOT LANCELOT—BUT ANOTHER I"
Professor St. George Mivart, writing to The Tablet last week
on Faith and Evolution, says of some opponent that—
"He brings forward an imposing list of authorities against me, from
Script ure and the ancient Fathers down to a distinguished modern theologian
named Punch, who strongly condemns my evolutionary views."
"Distinguished modern Theologian," of course, Mr. Punch is, as
he is a distinguished everything else, but he is the last person to
condemn Mr. St. Georoe Mivabt's Evolutionary Views; in point
of fact rather the contrary. History repeats itself here as else-
where. Who does not remember Mr. Weller's indignation on
seeing the magic name of his master " Pickwick" inscribed on the
coach-door. "And," said Sam, "not content with writin' up
Pickurick, they puts 1 Moses1 afore it, vioh I oall addin' insult to
injury, as the parrot said yen they not only took him from his
native land, but made him talk the English langvidge artervards."
Then he subsequently inquired, "Ain't no one to be whopped for
takm' this here liberty, Sir f"
The case is parallel. That there should be anyone sufficiently
temerarious to call himself "Punch," is staggering; but, when it
comes to "writing up 'Moses' afore it," that is, attributing to
Mr. Punch an intolerance which is utterly foreign to his charucti r,
then he feels that a dignified protest must be made, and he wishes it
to be distinctly understood that he is not the "modern Theologian
named Punch," who condemns Prof. iSt. Geoboe Mivart; and he
hopes that his namesake will henceforth recant his error of rash
judgment, and show himself worthy of the great name he has the
exceptional honour to bear.
AN ELOQUENT BUST.
Mb. Lowell availed himself of the unveiling of Coleridge's
Bust in Westminster Abbey, to deliver what must be considered in
every respect a most admirable oration on the Poet. Among the
exceptional merits of this speech were the absence of anything
like fulsomeness, and its nicely weighed measures of charity and
justice.
Verjr different nowadays is the amicable feeling between the two
countries, which Mr. Lowell has done so much to foster, to "the
spirit of hostility and sneering " which Colkkidoe, as recorded in
his Table-Talk,—conversational paragraphs that are not all wisdom,
by the way, and occasionally very far from it,—complains of in
English books of travel. "They (the Americans)," Bays he, "hate
us, no doubt, just as brothers hate; but they respect the opinion
of an Englishman concerning themselves ten times as much as
that of a native of any other country on earth." Substitute, in this
paragraph, "a distinguished American" for " an Englishman," and
read "more than" for "as much as," and we have what might
have been uttered by Coleridge on Lowell
About the Bust, as a likeness, nothing particularly complimentary
seems to have been said, but no doubt it is "invested with artittio
merit;" and if, added to this, it is a speaking likeness, then it will
be worthy of Mr. Lowell's speech, as being a "Bust of eloquence,"
which provoked from the Audience a " Bust of enthusiasm." West-
minster was full of Busts that day. Ah sit omen! for, a propot of
"Busts," if there were a mitred Abbot of Westminster in these
explosive times, he would run a considerable chance of being a
dynamiter'd Abbot, But this is wandering. Floreat Lowell 1

'A BRUSH WITH NOBS."
(A Letter to Robert, the City Waiter.)
t Deab Robebt,
When you was
so down'on me for seek-
ing a bubble, as the poet
says, instead of poking
buns and things into
master's oven till the
sight of a muffin made
me ill, I was wild. And
when you beoum a city
magnet and bragged of
haying as much spark-
ling behind a door as
you could carry, I was
wilder, for haying neg-
lected chances. But now
I've seen summat more
gorjus than city feeds,
though there was no
sparkling about, except
dimonds, such as you '11
never see. Your Mar-
esses and Sheriffisses for
all their fine feathers
are small fry to rub
shoulders with after
Dokisses and Baronisses,
such as I met, as common
as winkles, at the Dror-
ingroom. There! It's
out. Who's the toft
now, Bob P I suppose
after that I've bin to
the queen's own droring-
room I may call you
Bob? This is how it
was. A friend of mine
as is a beafeater, but
timid, was took bad when ordered for dooty among the swells, so I, being the same size, and
not nervous, changed uniforms; and a fine lot they all looked, I tell ye, with long tails drag-
gling behind and noses in the air. At least I thought so at first being dazzledlike. They're
not shy, at least the old uns. Not they I My, and ain't they game! How they picked each
other to pieces in loud voices which everyone could hear, tho' they pretended not. I've heard
tell of the Faliss of Truth, and now I know that Paliss is Buckinham on Droringroom day.
To start with—the Olduns got riled because there weren't chairs enough ; and those as had
to stand, reckoned up those as could Bit quite as spiteful as in Mud-salad Market. They
wondered (in a shout) what common Barber did their back-hair, why the 'Ousemaid couldn't
lace their gownds straight, and said offal things about their Jewelry. Well, if them's the
manners of the Upper Suckles, give me Mart Jane, and am and eggs. She and the pals know
as they must be civil, or they'll get one in the eye. But with the Upper Suckles it's
different. You mustn't hit or scratch, however badgered, but only sneer with perlite
sniggers, like knives. So, eyes and nose being safe, the old uns, when hungry and cross, are
as bold as brass, and sharp as razors. I got the errors, for all the shocking things as they said
was true, which ought to have made it rankle.
_ One remarked that near all the gownds was done on the cheap, and badly made, of common
silk, when there are lots of fine stuffs about, and that much of their lace was sham. And
another said that the nobesses who ought to be inside like decent people, wriggled theirselves
out of their misfits as if they'd been hired for the day (as gents do evening suits) instead of
being their own. I'm sure I've seen ladies at the theatres on five pound a week dressed more
handsome and in better taste, and knowing how to wear their clothes. But I suppose if you 're
a real Dukiss, you think you may wear any shabby thing and look anyhow. Misb Cbabshell,
of the St. James's, depends on her frocks for dinner, and a Countess doesn't, you see. And if
Her Royal Majesty could hear how they grumbled! If people yelped like that at the
Criterion Bar, they'd get the kick-out, I m thinking. "Not even a cup of tea!" cried one,
"Nor a sponge-cake!" howled a second. "Ain't it crule!" groaned a third. And then the
heaving and scroogeing from one room into another! I could see it all from where I stood.
Talk of bearfights! Such elbering and saying sarcasms while smiling beautiful, taking no
notice of the officers crying, "Pray, ao be patient!" By the time they got to the Presence, I
wonder they 'd anything on at all. Their clothes was so cheap, I suppose, for fear of leaving
'em behind. When Dukisses go to the Droring-Room, the band ought to play loud, or some
day they '11 be provoked beyond cussing. They '11 be making zerebas among the royal furni-
ture, and playing Old Harry with the china. I quite trembled, although not nervous,
thinking what Mast Jane would do in such a case. There was two bands, in the two quad-
rangles, one for the footmin, and t'other for the coaohmin, I presume, as they couldn't be heard
inside. The Swells who mismanage these Shows should take a wrinkle from the lower orders.
There's nothing like music and something to drink to keep people civil. It may be said,
"Them as object can stop away." Not so. Nobesses, I'm told, must go to a Droringroom or
they '11 get theirselves disliked, and it broke my heart to see delicate gals quite faint from
cold and hunger, while their mothers' stormed. When I got back into my own regimentals I
thanked'my stars that Mary Jane isn't a nobess. In future, every time as I see a hatchment
on a swell house I shall salute and say, "That's for a dowager who fought bravely at the
front, and died of a beargarden." Ever your pal, Thomas Atkins.
A MODEKATE DRINKEB.
{With Compliment* to Sir F. BrarnvtU.)
Teetotaller I '11 own I'm not;
No more a pledged forswearer
Of liquor, than habitual sot;
An what can I shay fairer?
Whenever pass the bowl 'sh the word,
I'm never known a shrinked;
Avoid excess—'cause that's absurd.
For I'm a Moderate Drinker.
A drop of shpirits, wine, or beer,
Good thing, beyond all question,
Whiles in this world we linger here,
'Cause why, promotes digestion;
That way repairs wear, tear, and waste,
Mends tissue, like a—tinker.
Mine's often got to be replaced,
So I'm a Moderate Drinker.

So puny, lean, and meagre.
How pale his cheeks are—and his nose—
My own is some shades pinker;
A sign of health, it only shows
That I'm a Moderate Drinker.
No doubt whatever of alcohol,
If drunk in moderation—
Or else injurious 'tis to all—
Promoting " sherrybrashun."
It reinvigorates the brain
Of student and of thinker;
Yours truly, therefore, I remain,
Confirmed, a Moderate Drinker.

• • You will understand. I am sure,
Sire, from the foregoing remarks, what are
the precise wishes of my August Master as
to the attitude ho will expect you to assume
in the matter of this so-called "Arbitra-
tion." Let me briefly recapitulate. Ton
will read the Statement that will be put
before you with as much or with as little
attention as you please, bearing in mind
that you are in no way called upon to
criticise but merely to endorse. The
"Counter-Statement" that will reach you
from London I should strongly advise you
to put at once into the fire. This course
will not only save you from the possibility
of any confusion of ideas, that might inter-
fere with the efficient discharge of the plain
and simple duty you are called upon to
fulfil, but give a fresh proof of that devo-
tion to this Empire, the susceptibilities of
which, if I may be permitted to say so, it
would certainly not, in the event of any
European conflagration, be to your Majesty's
immediate interest to arouse. But yon will
appreciate this. Finally, bear in mind
that with names, dates, and places you have
nothing to do. Above all, do not on any
account refer to a map. And now I think
1 need say no more.
* • • This then, if your Majesty will
permit me to revert to my original conten-
tion is the point that will have to be de-
cided. That it is necessarily enveloped in
some little obscurity cannot be denied; but
still, by a careful minute and patient ex-
amination of dates, names, and places, it

is not only the earnest hope but the confident belief of my dis-
tinguished colleague at the head of Her Majesty's Government
and of myself also, that you will be enabled to arrive at a fair,
equitable, and satisfactory solution of the difficulty, in a sense
agreeable to the instincts and consistent with the traditions of
the present foreign policy of this oountry. Above all, I would
humbly recommend your Majesty to make use of an authentic and
reliable map. To facilitate, therefore, your labours in the geo-
graphical problem proposed to you, I am taking the liberty of
forwarding you herewith seven different charts of the region in
fuestion, in each of which you will observe that not milv has the
'rentier line been adroitly drawn in a new and unsuspected direction,
but that the positions of towns, hamlets, rivers and mountain
ranges, have been cleverly placed in fresh and startling situations,
and even omitted altogether.
With such elastic materials Her Majesty's Ministers cannot doubt
but that you, Sire, if you find yourself forced by private consider-
ations, into which it is neither their wish nor province to enter, to
decide this question not absolutely in their favour, will at least so word
your decision that the halo of diplomatic mystery which they are thank-
ful to acknowledge has hitherto successfully surrounded their efforts
may triumphantly enshroud them to their final and irrevocable com-
pletion. In conclusion, I am desired by my illustrious Chief to convey
to your Majesty that, while placing every reliance on your Majesty's
sense of what is both fitting and humorous, he cannot refrain from
expressing a hope that you will carefully read up all his recent
Parliamentary utteranoes bearing upon this interesting matter. It
is in them, he desires me to add, that he believes your Majesty will
find a model of that caref ul and quite peculiar use of language that
will enable yon, while apparently turning a moral double back
somersault for the benefit of an enlightened Europe, to startle
friends and foes alike, while perfectly unconscious of the fact your-
self. Once more reminding your Majesty that the word "recall"
has seventeen distinot ana different meanings, aocording to the
iroumstanoes under whioh it is used. I am, Sire, &o. • * • •

am sure we are, you know, Papa dear, from all I have heard about

but quite privately, between ourselves, I should like you to be able
to say that this dear oountry of ours has the best of the quarrel, and
has nothing to be ashamed of. One little word more, Papa, dear.
Don't be afraid. • • • •

going on, and only hear what A tells me. He says that it will
be all right now, and that you will find the case quite easy to deoide
when you look into it— (I think it is a great shame to worry you
with such disagreeable things)—and he is sure you won't hesitate
a moment about the result. I suppose he means by that that you '11
decide for us. If you do, my dear Papa, of oourse I can't help
being glad, because I know whatever A is obliged to do some-
times, he means so well. This is, of course, strictly private and
between ourselves; but, if you have to do so, you must not mind

ESSENCE OP PARLIAMENT.
bxtractsd from
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, May 4.—Rather a lively
night up to now. Gladstone announced that there would be no war
with Russia. Conservatives at first struck dumb, but Randolph
found voice for them, and since then they have been in full cry. A
little hitch at commencement. Hitch—I mean Hicks—Beach
solemnly protested against going forward with Vote of Credit that
night as arranged. Conservatives roared and cheered and groaned. A
wicked Government that wanted to entrap Opposition into hasty Vote!
This was at five minutes to Six. At a quarter past, Randolph rose,
and, in hisfrank, simple way.announoed determination to obstruotCom-
mittee of Supply unless Vote of Credit were brought on immediately.
"Let us go on with Supply till Ten o'Clock," Dilkk pleaded;
"then we '11 take the Vote of Credit." "No," said the unrelenting
Roman Father who represents Woodstock, "we must have Vote of
Credit on without moment's delay." Whereat Conservatives roared
and cheered and groaned.
A wioked Government that attempted to put off Vote of Credit,
and deprive Opposition of opportunity of discussing it!
Randolph fired off tremendous speech. "Terrible news," this
prospect of peace. For an hour Conservatives been trying to extract
information from Government as to particulars of proposed arrange-
ment. Got no information, Gladstone saying terms of reference
not settled, and so forth. But Randolph knew all about it. "A
base and cowardly surrender." That was all. But it was enough,
and the Opposition lifted up its voice and wept.
It was when Randolph sat down that the tin canister episode took
place. Resuming seat, came in contact with hard substance. Found
small canister, hermetically sealed, placed right in centre of Fourth
Party's camp. Randolph hastily replaoed it.
"Wolfft," he whispered, a little hoarsely, "just keep my place.
Be hack presently. Little dry, don't you know, after long speech."
Gorst saw it next, and thus began: "Keep my place, there's a
good fellow. Want to look up Gladstone's speech on Vote of Credit
in '78. Think I've got him in a cleft stiok." And Gobst was gone.
Arthur Balfour, catching sight of gleaming tin canister reposing
peacefully close to Wolff's coat-tails, didn't wait to make any
remark, bat left the House in three strides.
"Very ourious," said Wolff. "Everybody going off. Shall take
Randolph's seat."

In moving np, discovered canister. Took in situation in a moment.
But Wolff not the man to shirk danger. "Won't be outdone by a
policeman," he said to himself. Seized the canister lightly but
firmly, walked out of House, and deposited it in Lobby.
It turned out to be only a quantity of Liebig's Exrraot of Meat,
dropped from pocket of some Hon. Member. But Wolff didn't
know that when, with head erect, lips firmly set, and an uncomfort-
able feeling that he literally carried his life in his hand, he oonveyed
the canister to the Lobby.
"Wolffy ought to have the Victoria Cross,".said Randolph, with
unwonted moisture in his eye.
Tuesday, 2.45, a.m.—Just divided on Vote of Credit. Three
Motions for Adjournment, and then Conservatives made what
O'Donnell calls "base and cowardly surrender." Parnellites
furious. Been kept up to this hour by promise of Conservatives
that they meant to see the thing through. At critical moment, when
fun at its fastest, caved in, ana went home. Parnellites fighting to
the last, opposed Vote of Credit, whioh was carried through report
stage by 130 Votes against 20.
_Never mind," said Joseph Gillis to Tim Healy, who was
raging at the defection of the Allies. "It's not so bad, after all.
We've done all that is possible to weaken the position of the country
in face of Russia, we've worried the Goovernment, and we've
dragged the Conservative Opposition down to our level. That's
pretty well for one night;" and J. B. tnoked his trousers into his
boots preparatory to trudging
homewards, for the last 'bus
had gone.
Tuesday Night.—^" Mas-
bet's style of eloquenoe a
little massive don't you
think?" Sir Peel whispered
to Sir Staffobd Nobthcote,
who was pretending not to
be asleep whilst Lopes was
droning away on the question
of Local Taxation.
"Ah, yes. Sir 'Massive'
Lopes, 1 see, said Sir Staf-
fobd. "Neighbour of mine.
Good fellow, sound on Local
Taxation question; but, as
you say, a little heavy."
Still in accord with general
tone of debate. What a
night we've had to be sure!
Pell seconded Motion which
raised on the English Regis-
tration Bill question of Local
Taxation. Henry Fowxeb
made able speech, _ whioh
marks great advance in Par-
liamentary style as compared
with his addresses from below
Gangway. Matter excellent,
manner good. After this we
had Paget, and Dcckham,
and Whitley, and the Un-
defeated Habris.
"Speaker pulled me up the other night," says he, "when I
wanted to discuss the question of wheat supply in debate on Vote of
Credit; see what he '11 do to-night."
Fortunately Habris did not present himself till debate had been
going on for five hours. At this time Speaker in state approaching
coma. The Undefeated, with one eye on the Chair and the other
on his manuscript, went on to the end unchallenged.
"Wish I'd brought the other speech with me," he whispered in
ear of Tomlinson. "Believe I could have worked in those remarks
about wheat without the Speaker calling _ me up. However,
another time, another time. Perhaps I can bring them in on Third
Reading of Seats Bill, or even might get them off at Question Time.
Might do that easily. 'To ask the First Lord of Treasury whether
he is aware that the total yield of wheat,' and so on. As far as I can
see there's nothing in Rules controlling questions that would
prevent my doing that."
Business done.—Sir Massive Lopes' Local Taxation Amendment
defeated by 240 votes against 238.
Wednesday. — "Don't remember that I ever wanted to shake
hands with you before," I said to eminent Peer. "Never cared much
for Knatchbull-Hugessen; can't stand Lord Bkabourne on any
terms; but would like to shake hands with you now."
"Certainly, Toby, with great pleasure. Always ready to do any-
thing that doesn't cost anything. But what are yon so unusually
friendly about?"
"Your letter to Ashfobd, don't you know? Come out at

Lobd R. Churchill's Thouqht-Rbading in the House of Commons,
Monday Evening, May 4th.
"He (Lord R. Churchill) agreed that the key of India was not at Herat, nor at
Penjdeh, or in the hands of General Komaroff or of Sir Peter Lcmsdbn; but it was
not altogether London in the sense Lord Beaco.nsfield supposed. The key of India
was in that House—on the Treasury Bench."
I won't say in true oolours, for I don't believe you 're a Tory any
more than you 're a Liberal. But yon 're going to wear the label of
the side you usually vote with. Best thing I know in your Lord-
ship's political career."
"Thank you, Toby." Very kind of you to say so. Of course
didn't take step without due deliberation. Need hardly say, if
Gladstone had found place for me in his Government in '80, would
have taken very different view of his polioy, and voted accordingly.
Left me out, though he tossed me a Peerage. Sat on cross benches
when I first went to Lords. Convenient place, you know—neither
one thing nor the other. Ready for offers from either side. Confess
haven't made much way in Lords. Nobody offered me anything
except cold shoulder. Try another game now. Take up sides openly
with Tories, and see what oomes of it. How did I happen to hit
upon this decision just now P Well, been drifting towards it for
some months. What gave last shove was, some fellow writing to
Newspapers, complaining of my appropriating six seats in mid-day
express from Folkestone, also getting train to make unauthorised
stoppage at roadside station, to pick me up. Why, good Heavens 1
what are we ooming to? I m a Director of the Railway. If I don't
make use of it for personal economies and comfort, what's the use
of being a Director P When things oome to this pass, time to turn
round. Democracy must be Stemmed; so I throw in my lot with the
Constitutional Party."
Business done.—Registration Bill in Committee in Commons.
Thursday Night.—Unpro-
voked attack on a bulwark

Alexandeb, sighing for
fresh worlds to conquer,
proposes to abolish Judge-
Advocate General I Osman

plainly hesitating; division
imminent; result doubtful;
when the whole course of
events turned by simple
and apparently trivial in-
cident. Cavendish Ben-
tinck passing through
Lobby on his way out to
dinner, thought he'd just
look in. No notion what
was going forward. Might
as well see how matters were
getting on. Committee still
pondering on weighty deci-
sion. Turned and saw Right
Hon. Gentleman standing at
the Bar. That was enough.
Baok came memories of all the grace, the learning, the dignity, and
the profoundly judioial weight wherewith the office had been endowed
during the existence of the late Government.
"Good Ged!" muttered conscience-stricken Alexander. "Never
thought of this. If we abolish office of Judge Advocate General
what's to become of Cavendish Bentinck in the next Ministry P"
The General hurriedly rose; asked leave to withdraw his Amend-
ment ; Committee eagerly accepted proposal, Judge Advocate General
saved, and Cavendish Bentinck wobbled off to dinner without the
slightest consciousness of the remarkable influence exercised by his
silent and momentary presence.
Business done.—English Registration Bill through Committee.
Progress with Army Estimates. On one division Speaker named as
tellers Mr. Small and Mr. Biggab. "Small and BiggarI"
exclaimed Arthur Balfoub, a great purist of language. "That's
a very awkward turn. Should, I fanoy, read smaller and bigger."
Saturday Morning.—Christening Party at it again. Made a night
of it. Some tremendous battles raging. At One o'clock this
morning, Radcliffe-cum-Farnworth having been Bettled, and the
Batley-Morley battle decided, Nolan rose to move to give North
Gal way alternative name of Tuam. "Hon. and Gallant Member,"
says DiLKE, "wants, I presume, to settle the difference between
Meum and Tnam."
After this division inevitable. Lord Richard Gkosvexok
announced result, twenty for Tuam, "and," he added triumphantly,
"84 for Meum."

Two Roses.
NOTES BY NIBBS.
It ii a pity that the Cabl Rosa, season is so soon coming to a close,
and that the last nights are already announced. The oftener the
hear Manon, the more popular will it beoome. For melody, I
to put it second to Carmen, A better performance of it
can hardly be desired than
that given by its present
cast. Mr. Maas could not
be improved upon as the
lover, and he will never have
a rival in his own celebrated
clear soup-song.
Mr. Ludwig as the repre-
sentative of the swash-
buckler, who "never says
die " but is always ready to
say " dice," is quite the beau
idial of the oharaoter, except
for the beard and moustaohe,
for which he may have ex-
cellent authority, — what
does Mister Ar/or/STr/B Mise-
en-Scenb say to it P—only
he should not mark the time
with his hat and foot. He
reminds me of a policeman
on duty, afraid of "getting away from the beat." Mr. Ludwig's
maxim seems to be, Keep your eye on your Conductor, and your
Conductor will pull you through."
Then Mr. Ltall, as Guillot, a sort of middle-aged Colley Cibber,
is excellent in a very absurd and, dramatically, not a very good
part. It is, however, a bit of oharaoter, and would be worth shaving
for, as that stubbly moustache whioh Mr. Ltall attempts to tone
down to flesh-colour; looks just what it is, only rather more so, and
imparts an unwashed and snuffy appearance to the beau's face,
which ought to be the very pink and white of complexion aided by
patch and pearl-powder. An Actor's face should be a tabula rata.
Mr. Ltall has his fair share of the music, so that, as 'Arbt would
say, "he can't want this Aextra Aair." He is capital throughout,
but especially in the First Aot and in the Gambling Scene. Mr.
W. H. Bcbgon, "the Stern Parient," acts with dignity, and is
the fortunate possessor of an almost Santleyan voice. His rendering
of the soDg, " Go wed tome Maiden" is one of the attractions of the
Opera. As Manon I never heard Mabie Roze to greater advantage.
She has the tender tone of the heroine of serious romantic opera, and
the sprightliness necessary for light oomio opera. Her fault in acting
is attempting too much; restlessness spoils many of her most care-
fully-studied dramatic effects, but she never makes this mistake in
her singing. I trust that one of these good days we shall see a
National Opera started under Royal Patronage, and managed by the
indefatigable Cabl Rosa.
From Opera to Drama. Go and see Bad Boyt at the Comedy
Theatre, but don't say I deceived you, by telling you that it is a good
piece. It isn't; it is a stupid,
weak-plotted farce, though I
can quite imagine that the
French original of it, Clara
Soleil, may be Btrong enough,
and that this version has been
considerably Bowdlerised.
M. Mabuts and Mr. Arthur
Roberts are simply immense
in it; you are bound to laugh
at them,—you can't help it.
Mr. Rose, too,—a third Rose
in this article whioh com-
menced with Mabie Roze
and Cabl Rosa,—helps the
fun by looking such a hope-
less idiot. He is a second
Peitley. Why the piece is
called by such a stupid title as
Bad Boyt, I fail to disoover,
though once I heard an allu-
sion to it, covertly dragged in
by the adapter, and uttered by
M. Mabius. Everybody who
takes my advice, and goes to see this Farce in three Aots, will agree
with me as to its imbecility, but will probably go and see it again
simply on account ot the excellent aoting—for it is real acting—of

Bad Boys.

AFTER THE EVENT.
"A writer in a recent number of the Revue dee deux Mondts, a distin-
guished French Admiral, has pointed out the method by which our
watering-places could be bombarded, and compelled to pay a heavy ransom
or be destroyed."—Admiral Sir J. L. Hay on our Coatt Defeneet.
Fr/BTHER corroboration having been given to the rumour that the
entire Channel Fleet had yesterday evening been unfortunately blown
up, in mistake, by its own newly-equipped torpedo squadron, and
that the enemy, in consequence, were already attacking all tbe quite
defenceless fashionable watering-places on the South and South-East
Coasts, a numerous Deputation waited on the First Lord at the
Admiralty with a view to hearing his opinion on the subject.
The Mayor of Margate, who was deputed to aot as spokesman for
his brother representatives, most of whom were in tears, said that
matters had really come to a serious pass. That very afternoon
Ramsgate, on declaring its inability to pay at half an hour's notice
£500,000, but offering as a compromise to hand over all the potted
shrimps in Pegwell Bay, together with the obelisk on the pier,
and half the profits of the Camera Obsoura, to the hostile Admiral,
had been ruthlessly bombarded with the result that all the apart-
ments " with a good sea-view" had been leveUed till nothing was left
of them but half the dining-room windows and the area-railings.
The letting, therefore, was bad, while at Broadstairs matters were
even worse, the one visitor in the place, a great invalid, paying a
few shillings a week for the hire of an underground cellar at the
railway station. There was, he regretted to say, only one torpedo
for defensive purposes on the coast, and that had been lent for a few
hours to the authorities at Heme Bay, who, not knowing how to
manipulate it, and fearing its capture by the enemy, had rather
thoughtlessly sent it off inland to Canterbury, where it was now
stowed away in the Dead Letter Department at the Post Office. The
speaker concluded by expressing a hope that the Government would
give the matter their immediate attention.
After listening with much apparent interest to the Mayor's account,
the First Lord said he would certainly give the matter his early con-
sideration, upon whioh, expressing their thanks, but still in tears, the
Deputation quietly withdrew.
THE LASS OF RICHMOND ILL.
[The Richmond Select Vestry having sent to the Home Office a memorial
with reference to the deplorable condition of the Thames in that district,
8ir W. Harcoubt has entered into eommunicaiion with the Conservators,
and has been informed by them that nothing can be done until a radical
change is effected in the disposal of the Metropolitan sewage.]
How happy might that maiden
be
If sweet Thames-tide might
run.
But no; Conservators agree
That " Nothing can be done."
Lips she must olose, must nip her
nose,—
The Stench-fiend lords it still,
And laughs with glee — grim
ghoul—to see
The LasB of Richmond ill!
On Richmond Hill there dwells a
Lass
Who on a bright May morn
By sweeps of sewage mud must
pass,
On Thames's waters borne.
What does she meet? Spring
breezes sweet?
No, muck is master still.
"Deposits" cake, and stink, and
make
The Lass of Richmond ill!

THE FRIENDLIRIES.
(From the " Daily Scuttler.")
Rf.crnt events abroad, combined with the masterly alternations of
our Foreign Policy, have left the Government with a large and
somewhat damaged stock Vf "Friend lies " on their hands. Partly
fur the relief of those loyal allies, and partly for the general instruc-
tion and entertainment, it has been determined to hold a permanent
Exhibition of "Friendlies" (whioh* will doubtless bo popularly
known as " The Friendliries ") in Epping Forest. Thus an asylum
of a paying character will be provided for the confiding peoples who
trust the promises of English Generals or Ministers, while the ethno-
logist and the naturalist will find constant pleasure in observing the
manners and customs of alien or savage races. Though the project
of founding the Friendliries meets with a good deal of opposition
beneath the Gangway (where " Serve the niggers right" is the pre-
vailing verdint), vet the Society for the Protection of Aborigines hopes
to bring the Exhibition to a successful and pecuniarily profitable issue.
Already have many most novel Exhibits been promised from
different quarters. When the Crimes Act (Ireland) has been modified
in a Constitutional and Liberal sense, it is expected that friendly
Irish (Landlords, and the like) will constantly be on view at the
Friendliries. The curious will be able, at a slight extra charge, to
see the destitute loyal Irish Landlord fed, and to observe his singular
habit of dressing in the miserable remains of an old evening suit.
The last surviving examples of Bailiffs, Protestants, Orangemen, and
Manufacturers, will also be on view. A very large assortment of
friendly Amaras and Bishareens is expected by next steamer from
Suakim. Owing to our masterly retreat from that port, several
thousand Arabs nave now no ohoioe between extermination and the
Friendliries, and, though most prefer extermination, considerable
numbers are to be among the Exhibits.
Fmm the province of Dongola a high class Mudir (early decorated)
is looked for. with a number of Sheikhs, and all the Kababish and
Shagiyeh tribes that ohance to esoape from the vengeance of the Mahdi.
South Africa sends exhibits from among her friendly Beohuanas,
Basutos, and Zulus. Most of these, to be sure, are now either killed
out, or permanently engaged in service (without remuneration) in
pious Boer families. It is not doubted, however, but that specimens
will be secured for the Friendliries. From the Cameroon s the
remnants of West African Friendlies not yet annihilated by German
gunboats may probably put in an appearance.
After the success of our arms in Canada has induced us to refrain
from further blood-guiltiness, the friendly half-breeds and Red Men,
or (in case of a French Canadian rising) the Canadians of English
descent, will doubtless gladly flock to the shades of Epping Forest.
In the event of war with Russia, and of an Anglo-Chinese
alliance, arrangements on a rather large scale will have to be made
for the reception of all the survivors of the Celestial Empire. At the
conclusion of peace with Russia 'on the usual terms), the friendly
Chinese, of course, would no longer be able to remain at home in
China, and will be glad to live on birds'-nest soup in Epping Forest.
Stuffed Afghans from Penjdeh are daily expected, as examples of
extinot Friendlies.
Can any popular entertainment be more interesting, or demonstrate
more clearly the loyalty of England, than this vast shelter, or asylum,
where races who have nothing in common but belief in our promises,
will peacefully fade away under the influence of our climate?
Heathen Rome, with all her greatness, could show nothing in the
least resembling the Friendliries. The Friendly Amara, in his hut;
the Friendly Irishman, grubbing with his umbrella for pig-nuts;
the Friendly Bishareen, at his mid-day devotions; the Friendly
Ashanti, pawning the last of his Aggrr beads for a morsel of bread;
the Friendly Chinaman, taking in washinir at an alarming reduction,
with the Friendly Mudir, reduced to editing a halfpenny evening
paper, will all join in one polyglot dirge for the honour of Old
England.
Holt Writ whollt Re-Written.—The Revisionaries having
accomplished their task, presented the Revised Version to Her Ma-
jestt. The Timet, reviewing their labour", said that they had. on the
whole, baen very successful with the Book of Job. A good job done.

TJHE WEDDING PRESENT.
A WORD FOR THE WISE.
Ik one of the recently published Home Letters (John Murray),
the Earl of Beaconsfield, then young Mr. Benjamin Disraeli,
writes:—
"I wish that I could convey to you some idea of the Saracenic architecture,
but I feel it is impossible. Description is always a bore, both to the describer
and to the describee."
"Describee " is a happy specimen'of a whole series of words much
required in our language. We thank thee, Disraeli, for teaching
us the word. "Payer" and " Payee," and many others used in legal
documents, whose object is generally not so much the achievement
of brevity but the acquirement of so much a folio. The " Speaker"
and the ,1 Speakee," the " Writer" and the " Writee," the ,rJoker"
and the " Jokee," signifying the passive person on whom the practical
joke is played. Let us commence and coin: let us be above or
beyond dictionaries, or rather let them take their proper place and
follow the language as spoken. If it be said that these newest words
are not in the latest Johnson, let us retort, "Walker l" Land
proclaim freedom of speech.

PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
A MATTER OF EXTREME DELICACY.
he gentleman has been
waiting for you ever Bince
ten o'olock, Sir," said my
excellent and admirable
Clerk, banding me a card
as I looked in at my
chambers j ust before lunch-
time.
"Mr. Muniment! Dear
me, I am sorry I have
kept him waiting so long!"
And then feeling that as
I am not very regular in
my visits to Pump-handle
Court, Pobtington might
have invented an excuse
to account for my absence,
whioh it would be better
for me to learn, I asked,
"Did you say where I
wasP"
"I said I wasn't quite
sure, Sir," replied my able
and valued assistant with
a smile.—" I said I could not be certain whether you were before
Mr. Justice Field in Chambers, or had a matter in the Court of
Appeal."
Congratulating myself upon the faot that Pohttngton had evi-
dently forgotten that I had told him, the last time I saw him, that I
thought of spending the next month at Heme Bay, I entered my
rooms. An old" gentleman of extremely benevolent appearance
jumped up from a chair, in which he had been reading the supple-
ment of an ancient copy of the Times, and bowed.
"Pray look through your correspondence before you attend to me,"
he said, pointing to a large pile of letters lying on my desk.
"With your permission, I returned, with grave courtesy, motion-
ing him to resume his seat.
_ My " correspondence" did not take me lony. The letters were all
circulars, with the exception of an application for Income-tax and
a dun from a forgotten tailor, who had evidently sent a bill to
Pump-handle Court in the faint hope of finding in the mature barrister
residing at that address the foppish purchaser of one of his dress
suits in 1860. However, I frowned at the circulars, making a few
notes (I jotted down mechanically the name of the Chairman of the
Proposed Patent Improved Road Car Bathing Machine Company
Limited, and the address of someone who said he had found out
the seoret of preventing baldness), and then turned to my visitor
and briskly put to him an interrogative " Yes 1"'
"I am here on a matter of Borne delicacy," began my benevolent-
looking visitor.
I bowed with much gravity, and resettled myself in my chair in
an attitude of deep ana almost painful attention.
"You will pardon me for questioning you, but as I have never had
the pleasure of seeing you in Court, perhaps you will tell me whether
I am right in supposing that you invariably conduct your oases with
as much brevity as possible P
"That certainly is my practice,'' I replied, carelessly throwing an
envelope over the endorsement of a Brief which belonged to a friend
who had accidentally left his papers on my desk.
"Quite so," commented the benevolent Solicitor, "and that you
seldom address a Judge and Jury at any length P"
"I prefer that my words should be few but weighty," I answered.
Having thus satisfied himself of my suitability to perform the duty
with whioh he wished to entrust me, my visitor explained the nature
of his errand. It appeared that he was the English Solicitor of the
Montagues and the Capulets, two Southern families having large
estates in this country. The heir of the Montagues, when a lad
domiciled at Oxford, had run away with the heiress of the Capulets
from a Brighton boarding-school, and had immediately proceeded to a
church in whioh they had listened to the marriage ceremony. As they
were about to leave the sacred edifice, their friends, who had followed
them in hot pursuit, arrested them, and the Bridegroom was lured
away in one direction and the Bride forcibly carried off in another.
Ten years had now passed, and from the moment of that hurried
parting the couple had never met. Since then hard times had come
upon both the ancient families, that could only be saved by the
union of Mr. Montagus with a person other than Miss Capulet,
and the bridal of Miss Capulet with a person other than Mr.
Montague. Moreover, what the head dictated the heart endorsed.
Both the would-be Bride and Bridegroom of ten years ago were now
anxious to be free from the chains (if any) binding them the one to
the other.
"I may add," continued my Client (my heart warmed towards him
as I thought of the benevolent-looking gentleman in this capacity),
"that as both the parties are backed up by a number of Corsican
relations, who have insisted upon ooming over to see their respective
kinsmen righted, any unhappy mistake on our part would be
deplorable."
"Certainly," I assented, more out of politeness than from a feeling
of conviction.
"Yes," murmured my visitor, half to himself, half to me; "I am
given to understand that, if I make a mess of the matter, they pur-
fse declaring a. vendetta against me—a most unpleasant process, so
am told, not known in English law, which has for its object the
shedding of the selected Defendant's life-blood. Should it be served
upon me, I think I should secretly transfer my practice to Australia."
With this, Mr. Muniment rose to take his leave.
"I should tell you," he said, with some hesitation, as he shook
hands with me at the door of my Chambers, "that Mr. Montague
(from whom you must get the facts to prove our case)_ has one bad
fault whioh may embarrass us—he takes his breakfast in the foreign
fashion."
'' Takes his breakfast in the foreign fashion," I repeated to myself,
when I was alone, "how can that affect the matter'("
Then I searched The Digest, and looked through Bkowne, but
could find nothing bearing on the point. Sheabwood'b Outlines of
Contract (a most useful and entertaining volume) did not materially
assist me, and as for Snell, he simply shirked mentioning the
affair, as if it had nothing whatever to do with his crude but well-
intentioned Principles of Equity.
The day of trial came. The Court was nearly empty, as the case
did not seem to have attracted much attention from the profession
or the public I got up, bowed, and in a few half-whispered words
(I usually address the Court in half-whispered words), explained
my mission. Then I called the Plaintiff. I turned round for a
moment to consult with Mr. Muniment, when he murmured, with a
stony stare, suggesting that he had "caught the eye" of Medusa,
"He has been breakfasting in the foreign fashion!"
A moment afterwards there were some heavy stumbling footsteps,
followed by a murmur. I once more gave my attention to the
witness-box. The Plaintiff was not there. He was attempting to
take a place on the Benoh. Being led back, the usual necessary for-
malities were completed, and he was ready tor my inquiries. I asked
him the few questions leading up to his appearance in the church, to
which I presume he answered in the affirmative, although I did not
hear his voice. Being a little nervous, I kept my eyes fixed on my
brief. When I at length looked up, he interrupted me by raising
his hand, and smiling blandly.
I am a little deaf, so I craned forward to hear what he had to say.
He suddenly changed his smile into a frown, and said, with much
anger, "Six four—bar one I" I referred to my brief, but could find
nothing to lead me in the line of examination he seemed to wish me
to adopt; so I referred to Mr. Muniment, who, pale as a ghost, was
trembling behind me.
"Have you any other witnesses like the one before us you wish to
call P " asked his Lordship, with much gravity, not to say severity.
"No, Sir—I mean my Lord," I replied, turning red and white
alternately, as is my custom when suddenly addressed from the
Benoh.
His Lordship bowed solemnly, and told me I might continue my
examination.
"Now, Sir," I said, "be good enough to say, after leaving the
lady at the church-door"
Who-told-you-left-lady-ohuroh-door?" angrily interrogated the
witness, his words, in his indignation, running one into the other.
"Why, this gentleman," I replied, taken aback by this sudden
and hostile interruption, and I pointed at Mr. Muniment. Upon
this Mr. Montague laughed, murmured something to himself, and
frowned.
"Come, Sir," I said, adjusting my spectacles and reading my
brief, "one more question. You never were married to the lady—
now, were you?"
To my utter confusion and astonishment, this query was met by a
direct and angry negative. When pressed, my witness bees
annoyed with my persistency that he was affected almost to
I turned round again to Mr. Muniment. He had gone.
"This seems a convenient moment to adjourn for lunch," observed
his Lordship, pointing with his pen at the witness-box.
The Plaintiff, who evidently must have been suffering from acute
fatigue, was asleep and noisily snoring.
"I may add." continued his Lordship, rising, "I do not see, after
this evidence, now you can prove your case." No more did 11

When I left the Bobing-Room, near the Carey Street entrance, I
do not think I was recognised by the large crowd of prejudiced
foreigners who appeared to be waiting for someone in the corridor.

of age, has the appearance, strange to say, of never having *

wig) hare a much more venerable appearance.
As for Mr. Muniment, I feel certain that he mast hare secretly

given me no further employment.
A. Briefless, Junior,
LOWE AND SUITE.
War any considerable sensation should have been oreated in
certain artistio and political circles by the Budden appearanoe of a
•mail volume of poems from the pen of Lord Sherbrooke is difficult
to conjecture. For in spite of the fact that a distinguished contem-
porary refers to the announcement of their publication as "a
surprise, a riddle, and a revelation," it is well-known that the
unexpended heat of publio and party strife so frequently finds a vent
and relief in unpublished verse, that more than half the notable
politicians of the day are said to have volumes of poems, if not
aotually ready for the Press, at least in such an advanced stage of
preparation as to warrant a lively apprehension of their speedy out-
pour on to the book-market.
This lyrical cacoethes scnbendi, owing, no doubt, to the presence
in their midst of the Laureate, has naturally attained a fuller
development among the Members of the Upper Hoase of the Legis-
lature, than it has in the Lower Chamber. Perhaps this is
fortunate, although a good deal of the verse already Bet up in type
speaks well for the leisure hours of statesmanship generally.
Taking a proof-sheet at random, what, for instance, can be more
truly pathetic than this brief but tonohing and defiant poem bearing
the signature of the Foreign Secretary P
"The little that is known " of my career!
'Tis thus, alas I mv better sense he shocks,
When I can very well recall the year
That saw Aim sporting childhood's frills and frocks!
And now he heads the Opposition's van!—
No wonder I'm a " Melancholy man 1"
1 "do no work," but dance eternal jigs,
And fritter all my country's strength away 1
Ha! ha! He talks of " Malice of the Whigi "—
Wait till he hears what Lessab has to say!
May be—when he some Blue Books comes to soan,
Like me, he '11 be—a Melancholy Man!
The following trifle of Lord Salisbury's, though by no means
original, has a deoidedly spirited and patriotio ring about it:—
How should a Statesman pose, Sirs,
Who wishes to lead a nation P
Ought he his mouth to close, Sirs,
And hazard no observation P
Weigh his words by the ounce, Sir,
His phrases carefully measure,
And not on Billingsgate pounce, Sir,
If Billingsgate be his pleasure P
If you tell me that'» what no ought to do.
I '11 call you a bankrupt and swindler too i
As a speqimen of what the true heart-felt experience of suffering
can do for inspiration, take the subjoined significant but fragmentary
lines from the First Lord of the Admiralty's Colossal Lyrio effort
"in six books of one hundred and twenty cantos each," whioh he
styles The Tragedy of the Marines:—
I nothing knew of guns or ships,
Of landing-stages, docks, or slips,
And *' bow" confounded oft with "stern."—
Till some kind angel whispered, "Learn"!
I smiled. My task I set about,—
And then the Government went out!
It would be possible to continue a list of extracts that, at the
present moment, are not devoid of a special interest, but want of space
precludes us from giving more than the two subjoined stanzas of a
quaint little song, one of a series of Ballades of the Front Benches
contributed by the Premier, It speaks for itself:—
Has the wrinkle gone out of my brow,—
Do I quiver and tremble no more P
When Bartlett gets up, do I now
Grow as pale as I used to of yore?
Ah.no! lam blithesome to-day:
More 1 I almost can affable be!
Do you ask me what makes me so gay P
'Tis my Petes is coming to me!
My Peter is coming to me!
He was roving in some far-off land,
Where my name, ah! he might have forgot;
And I longed so to olasp his dear hand,
For he seemed to be making things hot.
So I summoned him back by the wire.
Bid him scuttle o'er desert and sea I
'Tis from frying-pan into the fire,—
Still, my Peter is coining to me I
My Peter is coming to me I
From the above few slips it will be evident that, terse, brilliant,
musical, and even refined as are Lord Sherbrookk ■ efforts, he has
set a dangerous example, and will evidently, before long, have to
look to his laurels.
PROBABLE ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.
Swillborouoh.—Colonel Partiman, unanimously adopted (by
himself) as Conservative Candidate for this town, addressed a crowc led
but not at all enthusiastic meeting last night in the Corn Exchange.
He said that to tax the Poor Man's Beer was the last iniquity left
for this Government to commit, and they had oommitted it. {Cheers
and uproar.) Why had the Government tried to throw the cost of
Registration on the Local Rates? {Cheers, and cries of " Why
not T ") He himself was a landowner, and he would cordially support
any measure whioh would take every burden off landed property,
and throw the whole on to the Imperial Exchequer. {Hisses.') It
might be urged that in that case the already highly-taxed middle
class in towns would have to pay for the entire cost of County
Administration. (" Hear, hear ! ") Well, all he could say was,
better that they should pay than that he should!—At this point in
his remarks the platform was stormed, and the gallant Colonel when
last seen was running along the High Street, with his hat battered
in, and his ooat torn to ribbons, pursued by an infuriated mob.
East Clodbhire.—Professor Cherub Flint was waited on to-day
bjr a_ Deputation of local Liberals and invited to stand for the
Division. In reply he Baid that, with regard to foreign politics, he
had not yet seen the Morning Papers, and therefore could hardly
state definitely whether he approved of the present polioy of the
Government. He thought he should have regarded the Soudan
campaigns with some disgust if anybodv but Mr. Gladstone had
been responsible for them. (Cheers.) He was glad that we were
going to leave the country. (" Hear! hear ! ") He hoped that the
Arabs killed near Suakim had been slaughtered for some wise end.
It was neoessary for this oountry now and then to show its horror of
the Slave-trade, and to convince the Mahommedan world of the
blessings of civilisation. {Cheers.) Now let him pass to the more
important subjeotof Local Rates. {General cheering.) If returned,
he was ready to vote for providing every agricultural labourer with
a cow and a new milk-pail, and to impose a land-tax which would at
once throw every estate in the oountry into the market. (Applause.)
He was a teetotaller, and approved of Mr. Childers' Temperance
Budget. (Dissent, and a Voice, " How about the Eleven Miliums t")
The Eleven Millions could not be said to have been improperly asked
for, as most of the money had been spent before Parliament voted
the amount. (Cheers and laughter.) A hearty vote of confidence
terminated the meeting.
Cokechester.—Mr. Bobadil Buster, addressing the Electors
yesterday, said that, having been kicked ont_ of his own little
Borough by the iniquitous Government Redistribution Bill, he had
run his Eye over the map of England to find a place willing to
receive him as an Imperialist Candidate. He believed Cokechester
was suoh a place. (Unanimous and angry cries of " No ! ") At all
events he intended to stand, whether they liked it or not. (Laughter.)
Look at the frightful extravagance of this Ministry 1 ("Oh! Oh.'")
He himself was in favour of a Spirited Foreign Polioy, which would in-
volve an annual expenditure, not of Eleven Millions, but One Hundred
Millions extra. (Hisses and groans.) A Federated Empire was the
thing 1 If the Colonies did not care to federate, he would oompel
them to do so. (Laughter.) He would like to know what oould
be more spirited than that? Then, as to our Indian Frontier, he
would annex Persia, Afghanistan, Thibet, China, and Belooohistan,
and drive the Russians back to the Caspian. To do this it would
merely be neoessary to treble our Army Estimates, and introduce
Universal Conscription. (Groans.)—Only a single hand—that of a
Deaf Mute, who misunderstood the motion—being held up in favour
of the Hon. Gentleman's candidature, it is thought probable that he
will reconsider his intention to stand.
Tee Times read Lord Randolph a severe leoture last Thursday.
Lord Randolph is not fond of playing the game of "follow my
leader," and in this instance the leader " followed Lord Randolph,
and gave him a nasty one.

Launce. When a man's servant shall play the fanny dog with
him, look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a puppy; him
and his three blind brothers, a pestilent, plaguesome, and perpetually
yapping Four! I have taught him—or should so have done could he
have learned manners by fair example—as one may say preoisely.
Thus would /teach a dog. Oh, 'tis a sad thing when a puppy cannot
behave himself in all companies. I would have, as one should say,
one that takes upon himself to be a dog indeed, to be as it were a dog
in all things. And your dog should follow, look you, and should not
lift up his yelp against his Master and his Master's friends, neither
flesh his ungoverned teeth in the unguarded kibes of them. If I had
not more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I think
verily he had been hanged for't: sure as I live he had suffered for't:
you shall judge. He thrusts himself into the company of certain
gentleman-like dogs in the Earl's chamber. There, as is his nature,
good lack, makes he a nuisance of himself by rash snapping and rude
yelpiDg, and that at the Earl himself of all men, who is, as one
may say, courtesy's mould and urbanity's mirror. All the Chamber
cried oat on him. Of all which ill-conditioned behaviour I, as the
acknowledged, though little regarded and ill-requited master of him,
have as it were, to bear the brunt and blame. How many masters
would do this for their servants? Nay, I'll be sworn I have, as
one may say, sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise
he had been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath
killed; otherwise he had suffered for't. Thou tninkest not of this
now!—Nay, I remember the tricks thou hast played me. Have 1

THE ADMIRALTY GOOSE; OR, THE MODERN MARINER.
{Liberally adapted from Coleridge—being a Broad Hint for (he benefit of those whom it may most immediately concern.)
A Modern Ma-
riner meeteth a
Prime Minister
on his way to
the House, and
detaineth him.
It is a Modern
Mariner,
Who hath
never been to
sea.
"Come, Koeth-
bbook, with
that winking
eye,
What wouldst
thou have of
me?
"The Commons'
doors are
opened wide,
They're waiting
to begin;
The Opposition
fame and fret:
Mayst hear the
nasty din."

The Prime Minis-
ter, suspecting
something in the
wink of the Modern
Mariner's eye, is
constrained to hear
his tale.
The Mariner tells
how the Ship was
put into Commis-
sion in a quaint
and fearful style.
He holds him with official grip.
"We 've built a Bhip," quoth he.
"Hold off! Unhand me, naval loon!
A ship I It cannot be."
He holds him with his winking eye—
The Premier he stood still,
And listens like some new M.P.
In charge of his first Bill.
The Premier sat him on a chair;
He cannot choose but hear;
And thus spake on that curious man,
The Whitehall Mariner:
"The ship, onoe built, was found to float
Without a single prop!
And then she tried her measured mile
Midst many a cheery stop.
"Her armament, ten ' sixty-fours,'
Marked ' Eighteen-flfty-three,'
Of not the very slightest use:
Still, thus she went to sea!
"It wasn't quite the sort of thing
We felt we should provide-
The Prime Minis-
ter heareth that
within the House
which maketh him
contented to listen
to the tale.
The Ship getteth
into hot water.
The Premier here looked t'ward the House:
There seemed some row inside.
The Speaker sits within his chair;
Red as a rose is he.
With effort to restrain in bounds
The Merry Irishry.
The Premies, when he noteth this,
Prefers the tale to hear;
So thus spake on that curious man,
The Whitehall Mariner.
"And now the Press-blast oame, and it
Was critical and strong;
It noted all the various things
That somehow would go wrong.
"The shaft would halt, and bend, and break;
The guns seemed all accurst;
For, loaded
slowly, one by
one,
They, one by
one, did burst.
"And then there
came of gibes
and sneers
An overwhelm-
ing swarm:
And such a row
got up, we
found
The situation
warm!
"For Biei
wrote letters
columns long,
And panic filled
the air;
We didn't know whioh way to turn
The row was everywhere I
"The row was there, the row was here,
The row was all around.
Eftsoons up went the Income-tax
To ninepence in the pound I
The Guns are
not as useful as
they might be,
which causeth
trouble.
The outcry of
the Public, in
which no First
Lord livpth
comfortably.
"At length an Admiralty Goose,—
The brute you '11 know at sight,—
Wheeled on the scene, and vowed that soon
'Twould set all matters right.
"'Tis ever thus that brute doth boast,
And will,—till some commotion
Make plain we've but a paper fleet
Wherewith to rule the Ocean.
"It eateth up the Estimates,
Bv threats 'tis ne'er deterred;
It blundereth and plundereth,—
A most ill-omened bird!
"And as it swalloweth each sum
Without remorse or shame,
And question shuns,—that shaft and guns
Keep up the same old game.
"Not one, but scores on scores, while I,
Poor minion of the Board,
From its foul wake, my flight to take,
At present can't afford.
"And so the Admiralty Goose
Soars on; and men may hollo,
And call me any names they like,—
Alas! I'm bound to follow!
"But from red-tape, and jobbery,
I feel at times nigh stirred
Away to break!—Perdition take
That most ill-omened bird!"
• • * •
"Good gracious, Whitehall Mariner I
Why not from bonds break loose?
Strike branch and root, by Jove! and shoot
That Admiralty Goose!"
A great sea-bird,
the Admiralty
Goose, cometh in
sight, and is hailed
with groans.
The Whitehall
Mariner dweUeth
on the unattractive
features of the
bird.
The Whitehall
Mariner con-
tin ueth his piteous
and despicable
confession.
At length the
Whitehall Mariner
getteth consoling
and comfortable
counsel.
Melancholy and Commercial. — Suakim-Berber Railway. —
The report that the local "Friendlies" had at last accepted the
offer of the British Government to work the above little Line for a
payment of " £2,000 a month, with an occasional train thrown in,"
Las, as might have been expected, again farther depressed the
ordinary Stock. It having been rumoured, later in the day, that
the new Management contemplated paying the Dividend on the
Perpetual Preference Stook in surplus Sleepers, and heads out off
Osman Digna's followers, there is a brisk rise, chiefly due to the
operations of Oriental holders; but the closing prices for Debenture
Coupons varied, as usual, from about 24<f. to 3irf. a pound.
"Coombe-eno Events cast," &c.—The Prince and Princess of
Wales have signified their intention of being present at the open-air
amateur performances, by the "Pastoral Players," at Coombe House,

the whole thing quite Coombe xlfaut.

AMONG THE "ANKWERKS PACKAGES."
The Antwerp Exhibition was formally opened on the second of this month.
We hare received an officially printed account of the ceremony. It is written
in " English as she is spoke." Here are some choice extracts:—
"Belgium had for the first time convocated at Antwerp all nations to one of those
great concourses, where (according to the very true expression of the president of the
Executive committee) the creating powers of science and labour, are combined in an
admirable synthesis. Unanimous applause have cheered this beautiful feast uf peace.
"The Exhibition with its yet unaccomplished installations and decorations offers the
site of an immense timber-yard, where a human swarm is moving; but in presence of
these enormous proportions, of the abundancy, of the perfection and richness of the
already exhibited objects, there is but one opinion, one echo to predict its complete and
magnificent success.
"The grand portico of honour dominated by its globus, flanked by its electrical
lighthouses, presents itself to the eyes of the visitor in its astounding airian height of
72 yards."
At this point we pause, we are "dominated by the globus." Let us take
breath, and continue:—
"The King, the Queen, the Royal family and the guests have then directed them-
selves in cortege into the great row of the Halls of Industry, at the extremity of which
is situated a monumental staircase. On the top of this staircase, which forms platform,
one has a splendid view of the immense gallery of machines.
"At a signal given by Leopold II, life was at once communicated to this prodigeous
assembly of all the perfectionnated mechanics which human genious has placed to the
service of modem industry.
"This is a fairy which defies the description of pen or pencil. Nowhere anything
comparable to this quadriletre of 22,500 square yards, where the mechanics, steam and
electricity are triumphing, was ever seen before."
Yes! exactly! quite " a fairy which defies the description of pen or pencil."
So at this point we stop. We anticipate a pleasant holiday trip to the glorious
old town of Antwerp.
BRITANNIA'S VOLUNTEERS.
Whew air resounds with war's alarms,
And conscripts from afar,
Like driven sheep, are forced to arms
To make aggressive war,
Let soldier-ridden lands beware
When freemen turn to fight,
Where Britain's sons their flag may bear,
They stand with Freedom's might.
They laugh to scorn our numbers,
And say our day is sped;
Because in Peace he slumbers.
They think the Lion's dead;
But wake him—and the farthest i
Return his angry roar.
And swiftly every spreading 1
Bears it from shore to shore.
Chorui.
Go, tell the world of conscripts
That Britain's Britain still;
Go, tell the world of conscripts
Our watchword's Freedom still.
So let Aggression's forced array
Fill those it may with fears,
We '11 answer their conscriptions with
A million Volunteers.
Canadian sons, from frost and snow,
Extend a ready hand,
Baoked still by hearts that fiercely glow
Like summer in their land.
And show our foes, whoe'er they be,
No rolling seas can part
The ties that bind the brave and free
Where beats a British heart.
Australian sons their blood have shed
Already by our side,—
For once Britannia bares her head
In gratitude and pride.
Strong in her gallant sons' support,
Her cause can know no fears,—
No Spartan sword was yet too short
That armed such Volunteers.
Chorus—Go, tell the world, &c.
They were no conscripts Maklbro' led,
But freemen—Volunteers,
A freeborn raoe from fathers bred
That won for us Poiotiers;
No conscript names were on the roll—
All heroes dead and gone—
That blazoned bright on Victory's scroll
The name of Wellington;
And Inkermann's immortal height
Will tell, for many a day,
How sternly sons of Freedom fight,
Let odds be what they may:
Thus, Liberty scorns vain alarms,
And answers baok, with cheers,
No conscript legions flogged to arms
Have yet flogged Volunteers.
Chorus—Go, tell the world, &c.
They think to crush old England,
And take her mighty place—
When they wipe out from eVry land
The language of her race:
When Justice meekly sheathes her sword,
And Freemen ne'er make laws:
When Tyrants rule by force and fraud,
And dead is Freedom's cause:
When Liberty shall see her home
Low-levelled with the turf,
And watch each son in turn become
A tyrant-driven serf:
When Freedom's sacred name's forgot
Within the hearts of men:
They '11 crush us to the earth; hut not—
By Heav'n!—but not till then!
Chorus—Go, tell the world, &c.

THE SLEETING OF THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY, HANOVER SQUARE.
ESSENCE OP PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, May 11.—Another Vote of
Censure! the eighth in history of present Parliament. Lord Geokg k
Hamilton' had oharge of Motion. Bather a sickly kind of thing.
Having agreed to Vote of Credit, and money already in course of
dispersion, proceeded to say wouldn't pass Bill recording Vote until
it knew what the Government was going to do with the money.
"Isn't this," said Bhodbick, "little like paying your Income-tax
one Monday, and on the following Monday declaring you won't
accept the reoeipt until the Collector gives yon 1 adequate informa-
tion as to process by which your contribution will reach the
Treasury P"
"You 're an able young man, Bro prick," (aid Lord John Manners.
"You interest me as youth always has done. But you are inclined
to take politics too seriously. We don't always do what we would,
hut what we can; and your Leaders having decided upon terms of
Amendment, you have nothing to do but support it."
"Fine speech, Geobgt's," said his Grace of Abebcobn, who from
Peers' Gallery listened to the stormy eloquence of Member for
Middlesex. "Stems to me that Randolph is altogether overrated.
He's said to possess fluency. Listen to Georg y. He makes reck-
less assertions. Hear Georgt. He is credited with an audacious-
ness that people sometimes mistake for impudence. Look at Georgt.
Seems to me that after this speech to-night Randolph must take a
back seat, and Geobgt will go to the front Don't yon think so?"
"Urn 1" I said. Never like to contradict a Duke. There are
comparatively so few of them. But there's something in what
Lardy says on this point.
"Hamilton's noisy vituperation of to-night," says the Sage of
Queen Anne's Gate, "has tfleet of raising Randolph in Parlia-
mentary esteem. Randolph is occasionally noisy, and frequently
vituperative. But there 's an indescribable something more that
makes him Randolph, and the absenoe of which leaves Member for
Middlesex Lord George Hamilton."
On the whole, a spirited debate, the one flabby thing about it
being the Resolution. Chaplin really grand. Realised for spec-
tators more closely than ever Mr. Toole's idea of the late
Mr. Disraeli addressing the House of Commons on momentous
occasion.
Business done.—Vote of Censure rejected by 290 Votes against 260.
Tuesday.—The Markiss rises to explain. Gladstone and Tke-
tei.yan, in other House, have been taking exception to his allusion
to Russia as either swindler or bankrupt. The Markiss explains
that he was only using " a commercial analogy." Nothing further
from his mind than to say anything disrespeotful of Russia.
Granville expresses satisfaction at explanation, but points out
that the introduction of the commercial analogy in this particular
place was unfortunate. Of course the Markiss had meant nothing.
Only how would any one of your Lordships, being in difficulties,
like to have this commercial analogy dragged in?" Their Lordships
shuddered. Markiss mentally made up his mind to avoid commer-
cial analogies in future.
Granville took opportunity to show that Randolph was not
quite so accurate as he might be. He had, it is true, refrained from

the use of commercial analogies, but he had gone astray on various
points of fact, upon whioh Granville gently corrected him.
Cranbrodke np like a bear whose cub had been touched. Mon-
strous of Granville thus to take advantage of blameless, mild-
mannered youth, who was not present to defend himself. Kimbebley
struck in to defend his chief. Every prospect of a row. Strangers
in Gallery expected to see coronets flying about, perhaps the benches
broken up, Lord Chancellor's wig torn off, and the Bishops
chevied oat of the House. But storm tailed as suddenly as it had
broken forth. Granville smiled benignantly at the Markies, who
was busily administering to himself an oath to abstain from use of
commercial analogies; Cranbrooke simmered down, and the
McCullum More proceeded to deliver more of his speech, interrupted
on previous night by illness of Lord Dormer.
Business done.—In Commons Sir Massive Lopes' new Motion on
Local Taxation question rejected by 280 votes against 258.
Wednesday. — More bad language. This time it is Jemmy
Lowtheb who is the offender. As might be expected, James,
avoiding the commercial world, indulged in what may be called a
sporting analogy. Accused the Premier of "bolting" early the
frevious morning to avoid particular division on Registration Bill,
his brought up the young colt on Treasury Bench in towering
passion. Accustomed to hear contumelious language towards him-
self from gentlemen opposite. But this sporting analogy seemed to
touoh him to the quick. Hotly protested against it.
"Well," Bays Truthful James, "if the Prime Ministeb objects to
my way of characterising the incident, 1 will Bay no more about it."

But it will be observed James had already said it, and there it
remained.
Business done.—Irish Registration Bill proceeded with.
Thursday.—Gladstone moved Resolution allotting Wedding Dowry
of six thousand a year to Princess Beatrice. On the whole rather a
depressing business. More like a funeral than the preliminary to a
wedding party. House listened in politely glum silence. Gladstone
seemed to feel this, and laboured along making most of argument
that this was the last. Also (being the last) promised Committee
for next year to go into whole matter. Labby opposed vote,
and O'Brien testified afresh to his disappointment at failure of
efforts made to spoil success of Prince of Wales' visit to Ireland.
W. Redmond gave the proposal a great fillip by opposing it, and
House divided; 337 for making the little present, 38, chiefly Par-
nellites, against.
Restof sitting, House hammering away at Irish Registration Bill,
whioh it finally disposed of. "Another milestone of the Session
passed," said Premier, tearing up the red rose he had put in his
buttonhole in honour of Princess Beatrice. "It's a dreary road,
and I shan't be sorry when the end comes. To start with new House
of Commons will be quite invigorating. But I really will retire at
the end of that."
Friday.—Met Shebbrooke in Corridor to-night, making his way
to House of Lords. Had under his arm a thin volume.
"Very small for a Blue Book," I said. "Can't be the Afghan
papers P"
No, Tobt," he said, blushing up to the whites of his eye-
brows. "It 's a little work of mine. Poems of a Lifetime I call it.
The Lifetime is, perhaps you'll say happily, a little longer than
the Poems. But that's neither here nor there. The Markiss has
asked me to give him an hour, and read him a selection. Very kind
of him. Didn't know he was fond of poetry. But we all carry our
little secrets about with us. Few suspected me of being a poet, and
I 'in not certain whether they will now reach the stage of conviction.
The only thing that mars the pleasure with which I regard this little
volume is the knowledge that Dizzy died before it was published.
How he would have revelled in it! Fanoy I can hear him declaiming
from my poem on Mont Blanc:—
H'-i" TO CORRESPONDENTS In no case can Contributions, whether
by a Stamped and Directed Envelope or Cover.
'Enough again to shake the throne
Of many a new Nap-o-lee-own.'
But I mustn't keep the Markiss waiting. Believe he's terribly impa-
tient till he hears me read. So good-bye now, Toby. Hope to see

Sr. Times reads Master Randolph a Lesson for making a Mess with the Ink.
you again shortly. Drop in on me some time, and share with me
airy bowl."
And SaERBBOOKE went off reoitinir, with appropriate gestures, that
beautiful stanza from his poem on The Chamois:—
"And as oft as I quaffed that icy dranght,
I have thought in my gladsome bouL
Can the generous wine of the storied Rhine
Compare with airy bowl P"
In Commons, Bottrke takes time by the forelock. Gladstone,
referring to promised papers on Afghan business, says only a portion
will be out to-morrow, bringing events down to Penjden incident.
Remainder after Whitsuntide. A little disappointing this, since it
is Penjdeh, and after, people want to know about. But nothing
daunts Boubke. Jumps up, and intimates intention of Opposition
to "go for" Government on these papers, "Though, of course,
this is premature," he adds, with reflection—at whioh the House
laughs. But Bottbxe has best of it, after all. "We '11 censure
them," he says, "for, if they don't deserve it on this matter, they
will on some other."
Business done.—House Counted Out at Seven o'clock.
A MAY MOANING.
"May has set in with its usual severity."—The Common Senser.
Oh, Mav is the month when the madly aesthetics!
Plunge deep into nonsense profoundly poetical I
They sing and they shout about sunshine and greenery,
Of beauty and blossom and song-birds and scenery:
I own that my notion of May is a hazy one,
And don't think its weather is good for the Lazy One;
To go out of doors I have not the temerity—
Now May has set in with its usual severity!
The weather, distressing for man and for beast it is,
The sky is o'erclouded, the wind in the East it is;
The streets and the footways detestably muddy are,
Oar cheeks are all blue, and our noses all ruddy are:
We've coughs, and we've colds, and we've pains moat rheumatics!,
Oar temper is short, and our language emphatical.
'Tis good-bye to comfort, to ease, and prosperity—
Now May has set in with its usual severity I
The mornings are dark, and the nights demoniacal,
We 're dismal, depressed, and we 're hypochondriacal I
Oh, May is a sell—there s no trace of blue skies about,
The month that all poets have told lots of lies about I
Let's all stop at home, and in easy-ohairs ruminate,
The curtains draw close and the lamps now illuminate;
Let's idle on the logs with most cheerful celerity—
Now May has set in with its usual severity!

OUR COPY OF THE INVENTORIES.
Second Landing. Military and Sporting Weapons.
Having a "Season Admission," it is unnecessary to take more
than an ordinary railway ticket to South Kensington, and then trust
to your own invention to
get past the man who
guards the turnstile at
the end of the Subway.
This opens a large field
for imagination, as failure
entails either the tine of a
penny or a human present
to the Police. Perhaps the
best mode is to engage
(with the assistance of an
accomplice) the attention
of the whole of the staff
to the fancied appearance
of an imaginary balloon,
while you rapidly pass
through the barriers.
Having done this, you feel that " done" is the proper word for the
occasion, and should be happy.
By entering the Exhibition by the Subway you avoid the hall with
its statue of H.K.H. gaily cantering through a small foreBt of
flowering shrubs, and yet this should not cause you deep regret. If
it does, assuage your grief by inspecting the magnificent collection of
Military and Sporting "Weapons supplied by the Royal Arsenal, the
Koyal Laboratory, and other amusing exhibitors. A nice serviceable
breech-loading 8-inch gun immediately attracts your attention as
the biggest thing in weapons in the Snuthern Gallery. As the
Official Catalogue is large enough to he confusing, it is better to trust
to your own common sense for an explanation. Looking at this very
fine specimen, which seems to be "laid" upon the hall clock, you
oome to the oonolusion that it must be an implement of sport
intended for "big game." Had you to meet a lion or a tiger, as a
husband, a father, and a subscriber to an insurance company, you

would certainly rest'satisfied with nothing smaller. It could be
easily carried by a couple of braces or so of trained elephants, and if
fired by eleotrioity (say at five miles' distance from the objeot aimed
at), should be a most useful fowling-piece. At close quarters there
is nothing to prevent you from entering the gun bodily and defying
the enemy from the muzzle. But the Royal Engineers, always
ready to oblige, have gone yet farther to anticipate the desires of a
keen sportsman, and have supplied him with a balloon, which may
be used as a means of esoape should the lion or tiger become too
exigeant.
Not far from these "Weapons" is a fish-torpedo, no doubt
intended for the capture of the wily salmon, the interesting minnow,
or the (comparatively) silly whale. A section of this charming little
exhibit is shown, including " the Secret Chamber," which, of course,
piques your curiosity. However, it is so generally well-known how a
torpedo is propelled, that it would be mere waste of time to explain
so open a secret." For the sake of country cousins, it may be
hinted that the "Chamber" contains a fly-wheel, a flat leather
band, some oogs, a 4-inoh pulley, a common C spring, and six pounds
of the best brass nails. Given these articles, and the simplest zany
will be able to solve the so-called " mystery." For all that, the idea
is a clever one, and the inventor deserves the warmest commendation.
Not far from " the Tiger Esoaper " is Mr. Nobdenfeldt's excellent
"pheasant-destroyer." This olever little weapon (it can't weigh more
than half-a-dozen tons) is excellently adapted to the modern battue,
as it should easily knock over a thousand brace in a score of minutes.
To the short-sighted Sporttman it should be invaluable, as by a
mtehanioal contrivance the Nordenfeldt oan be so trained that it
shall "cover" everything living within a range of three miles.
Close to this pretty little weapon is a model of Colonel Moncrleff's
Hydro-pneumatic Carriage, a vehicle specially adapted to the needs
of invalids. No oountry-house or shooting-box should be without
one.
Having got thus far in " the Inventions," the thirster after know-
ledge will no doubt require refreshment. And now he will meet
with his first disappointment. Remembering the site of the dining-
rooms of 1884 and the previous year, he will turn his steps to the
south, and find, to his deep disgust, that the space then selected
for " Food, and its Consumption," has this Season been devoted to
the exhibition of "Improved Agricultural Implements." He will
come to the conclusion that the Inventions thus forced upon his
attention are feeble, uncalled-for, nay, even impertinent. Having
arrived at this unprejudiced opinion, he will hurry away, and, a few
minutes later, discover the objeot of his search. And here (at the
soup, fish, and joint meal) we will leave him with the explanatory
remark that the plan of the present Exhibition differs only from the
Healtheries in these respects,—that what was last year something or
other is now something else, and that it is perfectly easy to master
the plan of the building if you are good at guessing puzzles, and have
in your possession a " tossing sixpence" with which to decide difficult
points.

AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.
Vienna, May 25.
The recent aggressive and stubborn attitude assumed at St. Petersburgh.
involving, as it is confidently expected here on all hands it will, a fresh and
further crushing humiliation for the Cabinet at St. James's, has been welcomed
in the best informed political circles with the liveliest signs of merriment and
satisfaction. The Petther Przeglond, in common with the rest of the Press,
hails the expected catastrophe with an ill-concealed and quite indecent delight,
concluding a leading article bearing the significant title of "Delenda est
Wapping, in the following words:— With an American Ireland, a Norwegian
Scotland, and an England partly Russian, partly Dutch and Danish, and the
rest French, Germany, Swiss and Bulgarian, Austria-Hungary could afford, at
a distance, proudly and defiantly to cry 1 Hands off 1' and carry out unopposed
her sanitary programme aimed at British Eastern trade on the Suez Canal. We
have often neartily wished to see our commercial friends of the North extirpated,
but have never, for prudential reasons, quite liked to express the sentiment in
print. But Great Britain now seems about to be seized by the throat on all
sides, and, therefore, there is really no more reasonable occasion for discreet
reticence. As soon as we are quite sure that our ' Old Ally' is well held down,
we shall not be the last in Europe to greet her in jeers, with her own national
proverb: 'Hooray !' Ow, Sir, is your Eye t'"
GERMANY.
Berlin, May 25.
There can be as little doubt as to the continual wire-pulling that is hourly
going on here, as there soon will be as to the nature of the explosion to which it is
inevitably leading up. A chance few minutes' conversation I had the honour of
having, at the house of a leading diplomatist only last night, with a very
distinguished personage indeed, whose personality I need not further indicate,
will give your readers some idea of the sort of pervading hostility that rules the
hour here. The talk was on our last checkmate in Zanzibar; and I summoned
up courage, and boldly asked the great Chess-player whether he would like to
see England reduced to the position of a ninth-rate Power, her Colonies shat-
tered, her commerce swept clean off the seas, an invasion on her shores,
famine and revolution staring her in the face, and her liberties extinct.
"Certainly—and the sooner the better," was the blunt
reply, followed by a loud good-humoured laugh, that was
soon lost in a silver tankard of iced Sardines, Brandy,
and Porter. "And what of Mr. Gladstone and his
colleagues?" I ventured to oontinue. "Send 'em to
Siberia by Parcels Post, wrapped up in their own ' Blue
Books.'" The Turkish Envoy, who was standing by,
and who, I am told, only speaks Arabic, smiled, now-
ever, approvingly at this—a circumstance which caused
the British Ambassador, who had noticed it from a
corner, to get up hurriedly and order his carriage. I
heard later that, as ,he was stepping into it, he narrowly
escaped being hit on the head by a pail of strawberry-ice,
flung at him from the balcony of the Refreshment-Saloon
above " by some unseen hand." On protesting to a Rou-
manian attache against this outrage, as amounting almost
to a violation of international courtesy, he assured me
that it was quite a common occurrence. "They all do
it," he said, with a smile; "and I hope some evening,
when no one is looking, to have a turn myself." Ton
may gather from the foregoing what our prestige is worth
at this Court at the present moment, and now little, if en-
gaged in any prolonged war against seven great European
Powers, we could reasonably rely on satisfactory assist-
ance from Liberal sympathisers in the Balkans.
SPAIN.
Madrid, May 25.
The complete and sudden failure of the " onion duty"
negotiations has produced a feeling of irritation here
that has been instantly turned to account at Berlin. The
pourparlers by telegraph have been unoeasing, and
the result only what might have been expected. An
English ham-and-beef shop at Cadiz was attacked and
completely wrecked last night by a furious Catalonian
mob singing the Cachucha, and demanding the invasion
of Gibraltar and cession of India and the Isle of Wight.
There has been also a most regrettable outbreak at
Biarritz, where several British invalids were set upon by
a band of well-dressed Spanish excursionists, dragged
from their Bath-chairs, hurled into the sea, and only
rescued from a possibly severer second drenching by the
sounding of the dinner-hour. Referring to this un-
friendly piece of buffoonery, the Impartial, in its to-day's
leader, merely remarks:—" It is an incident like this
that, more than any other, will serve to show the
huckstering coward, John Bull, that if war break out,
as we trust it may, between the two nations, the
courage and chivalry of Old Castile and Aragon are as
living a force in the beloved Peninsula as ever they
were in the glorious days of Ferdinand and Isabella.
Calling, later in the day, for some explanation of this,
I was, by order of the Editor, kicked out of the office
by three printer's boys, the doorkeeper, several members
of the permanent staff, and an advertising agent. Such
is life in Madrid at the present moment; and though I
have made a complaint at the Embassy, I can't say that
it is pleasant.
ITALY.
Rome, May 25.
The ominous rumours to which I referred in my yes-
terday's telegram, are fully confirmed to-day. Prince
Ui-m u;<:k has again triumphed. It appears that not-
withstanding all pacific assurances to the contrary, the
refusal of Mr. Gladstone to hand over bodily, as de-
manded, at the suggestion of Berlin, by Italy, the whole
of the Red Sea littoral, Perim, Aden, Malta, and Cyprus,
together with a money indemnity "on account of
£5,000,000 for the "preliminary expenses of super-
vision," has produced a painful state of tension between
the two Governments, that is fast growing acute. Indeed,
it was noticed at the hall at the Austrian Embassy that
just as Sir Savtle Lumlet was about to sit down,
Signor Mancini, who was apparently talking earnestly
to the German Ambassador, suddenly took his chair
from under him, with the usual results. This has pro-
duced the worst effect, and there is no deubt but that
for the moment the entente cordiale is seriously imperilled.

The refusal of the Chamber by a majority of 435 to 2

irons of the Editor, Publisher, and Staff, together with the expul-
sion from the country of all the subscribers, and the official visit
of the Viceroy of India on all fours to the French Governor, would
satisfy the susceptibilities aroused here by its appearance. That
things are grave there is not the slightest doubt. Speaking to a
moderate Deputy this morning, he assured me that unless Mr.
Gladstone should be prepared to recall and disgrace Lord Dufferin,
hand over the Madras Presidency as " a guarantee of future good
behaviour." and pay the expenses of the Tonquin Expedition,
"rendered necessary by a regard for French dignity wounded in
Egypt," a crisis would be inevitable; but, he added, that, of course,
Mr. Gladstone would yield. As a comment on this, I may add that

QUITE ANOTHER GORDON MEMORIAL.
The Grand Military Concert at the Hotel Metropole, was one of
the most brilliant sights we've seen for some time. All the rank
and fashion of the West and East were wandering about the
corridors, lounging on the divans, listening to the music, talking,
chatting, and enjoying themselves. Guardsmen were "Stewards.
By the way, why cannot the title of " Steward" be dropped on such
festive and charitable occasions as concerts and dinners, especially
dinners ?" Steward" calls so forcibly to mind the sea-passage
between Dover and Calais. The Stewards were distinguished by an
order worn on the right side of the dress-coat. Perhaps it was a
tasting order for the cellars of the Metropole.
The Prince and Princess arrived about 11 "30, and there was the
usual loyal rush, scrooging and crowding to bask in the smiles of
Royalty for even a brief five seconds. It is a noticeable feature of
aU these gatherings that the people who sorooge, and rush, and
struggle the most to get into trie front row and to obtain a loyal
recognition of their presence by a special bow, or nod, or a pause
for a handshake, are just the very persons who see most of Royalty,
who meet Royalty constantly, and to whom, apparently. Royalty
is the very breath of their lives. The rudeness of the best bred
persons, specially the ladies, who, we suppose, pick it up at the
Drawing-rooms, is really remarkable. And oh, it is so delight-
ful when the supreme moment comes, and the Royal party is about
to pass to see the preparations for curtseying, the smiling, the agita-
tion, the general pulling-themselves-together of everyone, male and
female, and then Their Royal Highnesses pass, greet here and
there one,—through whose frame a perceptible thrill of joy passes,
and an inch is added to his or her stature,—and ignore those who
have been the most eager and the most anxious to thrust themselves
forward, and the depth of whose bitter disappointment, judging by
the forced smile on their countenances, it would be difficult to gauge.
We noticed an elderly Military-looking Man with decorations and
a large chatty Dowager: they struggled into the front, and took up
such positions as seemed to declare that Their Royal Highnesses
should only pas3 into the Drawing Room over their bodies. The
Dowager talked and laughed: so did her vis-d-vis the Elderly
Decorated One. They gave, each on their own side, in a low tone,
anecdotes of the Court and the high Society which they adorned.
They expected to welcome the Prince and Princess as if they were
giving this grand party: and then the August Personages came
along smiling and bowing, and passed this couple without the
slightest appearance of being aware of their presence: indeed, all the
Decorated Person saw of Royalty was the Prince's back, while the
Princess spoke to a lady at a distance of three or four from the
Dowager, and then sailed on, passing the Dowager as if she had
been invisible. Oh, how crestfallen they were! How like a couple
of Cardinal Wolseys they must have felt when they got home, and
tted_ their misspent hours of snobbishness.
hall: they were magnificent,

out for a walk, but had been suddenly stopped byitheir commanding
officer, and told to oome into the Metropole Hotel. The Police were
also splendid. So was Our Robebt the Waiter from the City. The
supper and the champagne were excellent, and for this everyone had
worked up an appetite and drinkatite by wandering about the Hotel,
"upstairs and downstairs and in my lady's chamber." In the bed-
rooms there were candles alight, and all the rooms had the air of
present occupation. We felt quite diffident about entering the
rooms without knocking, and, on coming in suddenly, we were
inclined to say, "Oh, beg pardon! Didn't know anyone was here,"
or "Mistook the room for our own," or some olher mild excuse, and
retire awkwardly.
What a chance for the Metropole! Few hotels could get such an
opportunity of publioity. It is a magnificent place, and at first
sight, and on such a specially brilliant night as last Monday, the
Hotel seems to be made for the accommodation of Crowned Heads—
none of your half-crowned heads—and for Rothschildren. It is
sumptuous, yet in excellent taste, and, in spite of its magnificence,
we should Bay that, when it is in ordinary working order, it will
be as comfortable—for that's the point, after all—as the Grand,
which has had some years the start of it.
It is a curious coincidence that this Military Concert for the benefit
of the Imperial late Egyptian War Fund, Soudan and Egypt, should
be intimately connected, with the name of Gordon, who, associated
with so many successes in this line, is responsible for the manage-
ment of the Hotel Metropole.

Something like a

TAKING OFF THE MASQUE OF PAINTERS.
My deabest Gladys,
I am so Borry that your Papa's gout kept you in the country.
He appears never to be well except in the hunting-season, when his
duties as M.F.H. seem to leave him no time for thinking about his
ailments! Don't say I am heartless, but I was
so disappointed that you did not come with us
to the Masque of Painters at the Royal Institute.
Such a pretty sight, dear! The tableaux were
a wee bit slow, and we had just a triiie too much
of Mr. Fobbes Robertson as Vergil. Mr. Fobbes
Robertson, it seems, is a Painter as well as an
Aotor—how clever! But the Royalties were
simply lovely, especially our dear Princess.
They stayed until the early hours, although the
Prince and the Duke, to say nothing of the poor
Marquis (who Beemed a little uncertain whether
he ought to seat himself in a gold chair, like his
Royal brothers-in-law, or be satisfied with a
resting-place of a less gorgeous material) must
have felt rather strange in their plain evening
dress in the midst of all the brilliant historical costumes and ancient
uniforms. Some of the dresses were so funny! There was a comical-
looking person in a toga and an immense wreath of lilacs, that
would keep falling into his eyes. And he wore a double eye-glass
(fancy an ancient Roman in a pince nez.'), and made us laugh so!
We were told that we should see all sorts of strange people, as the ball
was going to be " rather mixed." You know what I mean—" Upper
Bohemia." and that kind of thing. But, my dear, it was nothing of
the sort! Very nice and sedate—almost clerical! Fanoy, not a
single actress! I was so disappointed! I think the Actresses one
meets about so clever. But dear Mr. Bancroft was there, and I
think I recognised Mr. Hare. They seemed quite at ease in their
costumes because, of course, they are accustomed to dressing up. I
was surprised to see so few Royal Academicians. Poor dear Mr.
Millais is ill, but there was no Sir Fbedebick and no Sir John
Gilbert, and not even Mr. Hobsley. Bertie (who went with us
in the ancient costume of his own regiment, the Rifle Brigade)
pointed out to us the eccentric Roman as Mr. Alma-Tadema. But,
of course, he must have been joking! You know who I mean, Mr.
Alma-Tadema who paints all that wonderful marble, and is so
classical. But in spite of the absence of the R. A.'s (I do not mean
the Royal Artillery—that was well represented) and the theatrical
celebrities, we enjoyed ourselves immensely. Met lots of people in
our own set (by the way everybody seemed to be wearing powder,—
the shops of Fox and Clabkson must have been emptied of their
stock of white wigs), and didn't come home until four in the morning.
Oh I do so wish you had been there.
Ever yours most affectionately,
Kitty Chattington.

HUMBLE PIE.
The appetite for " Humiliation" seems to grow by what it feeds
on. Partisan warfare cannot, apparently, be carried on without it,
and without it our spouting patriots and bouncing Pressmen could
not get on at all. The worst of it is, that no Government, not even
the existing one, can be trusted to consume quite enough of it for
party purposes. The manufacture of Humiliation, therefore, in
speeches and leading articles, goes on merrily all round. It is
a pleasing process. Misconstruction is its main support, and when
that fails, it is, of course, necessary to fall back upon sneer invention.
The daily supply of kicks, buffets, and snubs, of which John Bull
is to be receiver-general, must on no account fail for the sake of
absurd accuracy or the want of a little lying. He must be proved to
be always in the wrong. His marrowbones must always be on the
ground, his flag ever in the mire. If his enemies overlook any
chance of humbling him, it must be pointed out to them in elaborate
leading articles. One journal takes the view that he is always on
the wrong tack, another that his foes are. But in either case the
humiliation is his. Whether he act or refrain from acting, whether
he stand still or advance, he cannot get out of that Valley of Hu-
miliation which is now his permanent abiding-place—according to
his rival party critics, bless them! Whether they really succeed in
humiliating him as much as they think, and—for party purposes—
hope, is doubtful. But one thing is certain. They succeed in
humiliating themselves.

LATEST METROPOLITAN ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.
{Statement by the Candidate for Haclington-cum-ChcUbury.)
fife

Lr an evil hour, I fear, for my peace of mind, I yielded to the no
doubt unbiassed advice of my guide, philosopher, and lawyer, and
consented to have my name announced as that of a gentleman of
large fortune and liberal principles who was prepared to devote him-
self to the service of his country in the capacity of Member of
Parliament for the Metropolitan District in which he resides. I was
informed, in due course, that the Liberal and Radical Association of
my District had resolved to permit my name to be submitted to a
meeting of the Council of Two Hundred, together with that of a
competitor for their sweet voices, at which meeting we were to
explain our views upon things in general, and to submit to any
amount of questioning and cross-questioning that the Council might
please to indultre in, that a vote would then be taken, in our absence,
and the losing Candidate was bound in honour to accept that decision
as final, and to support his successful rival against the common foe.
How I am quite prepared to admit that 1 am no orator, as Glad-
stone is, but still I am generally able to hold my own pretty well in
our Vestry meetings, where, I have been told by brother Vestrymen
when partaking of my hospitality, my style is thought to resemble
that of the Home Secretary. But I confess that the idea of a long
speech npon political matters, in which, to tell the honest truth, I
tike but very little interest, followed by a cross-examination by a
large body of keen politicians, seemed to me such a terrible ordeal
that I had serious thoughts of at once withdrawing my name, but
my best beloved, having been informed by my kind lawyer, now my
agent, of the many social advantages attending the position of an
M.P. who always votes straight with the Government, such as Balls
and Concerts at Buckingham Palace, Garden parties at Marlborough
House, &c. &c, would not listen to such an idea for one moment, and,
with the assistance of my adviser, hit upon a scheme, that we at once
proceeded to put into practice, and that had the completest success.
This was nothing less than a family rehearsal of the coming ordeal.
My three boys are all thorough Radicals, my son-in-law is a Moderate
Liberal, and my kindly Solicitor, having no opinions in particular,
could put in an awkward question or two on any of those many
semi-lunatic fancies, such as Anti-Vaccination, Municipal Reform,
the Claims of Sir Rooeb, &c, which are suoh a terror and a nuisance
to Liberal Candidates. It took place accordingly, and as all were not
only allowed, but requested to speak out freely and boldly, I found
myself subjected to such an endless torrent of what is called, I
believe, "heckling," that I felt that no reality could exceed it in
pungency and sarcasm. So I set out to the appointed meeting, on the
appointed evening, after just two glasses of old champagne to give
me a good start, full of courage, full of confidence, and full of faith
that I should bear myself as becomes a man who seeks to take a
share in framing the future destinies of his country. My cautious
friend did not accompany me to the place of meeting, but arranged
with me that he Bhould occupy a back seat among the audience near
the centre, so that when I was asked any doubtful question he could,
by a slight movement of the head, indicate the more prudent answer.
On arriving, I shook hands with my opponent, as I believe is
customary on somewhat similar occasions, which manly act I could
see was regarded favourably by the keen-looking audience. Fortu-
nately, as I think, my opponent had the first go in, as a most
respectable working-man called it, for it gave me a capital oppor-
tunity of discovering what opinions the meeting approved of, and
what they were opposed to, which, as I had no particular opinions of
my own, was of course of great advantage to me when my turn came.
My opponent was allowed to speak for half an hour, and then had
to submit to half an hour's questioning. He spoke fairly well, but I
had no difficulty in discovering where he failed. He often hesitated
in answering a question, and sometimes even fenced with one. If I
were writing a book of maxims for Candidates for Caucuses, my
first maxim, and I would print it in letters of gold, would be,
"Never fence with a question." It makes the audience doubtful,
and it makes the audience angry, for they at once imagine that you
are trying to deceive them. I looked towards my legal friend and
saw him cool and smiling, and I felt that our feelings were in aocord.
So, when my turn came, I carefully avoided all the pitfalls into
which my opponent had so innocently and so ingenuously fallen, and
dwelt upon those topics which were evidently popular with my
audience, and when my cross-examination began, by keeping my
eye upon my nodding friend, and speaking out boldly and without
hesitation, as he directed me, I gained their warm hearts and their
warm hands, and sat down amid deafening applause, which was
heartily and laughingly renewed when the working-man before
alluded to shouted out, "That's the gent for my money; he's so
straight-forred." My opponent and myself were then requested to
leave the room while the vote was taken, and that half-hour was
about the longest I ever spent in my life. Even that long long half-
hour came to an end at last, and I was received with loud applause
as the winner in this first step towards the realisation of my fondest
hopes.
ODE TO THE NORTH-EAST WIND.
{A Long Way after Kinqslsy.)
By a Debutante at the last Drawing Boom.
Welcome, wild North-Easter?
Oh! most certainly!
Here a girl must gladly
Turn a verse to thee I
Welcome, black North-Easter?
Eugh! A German goddess,
Or a Danish nymph,
Never donned low bodice.
True it looks like Summer,
There's a chilly glare;
But the Sun seems hurtling
Ice-shafts through the air.
In their glad Spring greenery
All the trees look gay,
But through Summer's scenery
Winds of Winter play;
Sweep my golden tassels,
To my bosom strike;
Make my toes feel tingling
In some frozen dyke;
Fill my eyes with tear-drops,
Cold—I hope as bright—
As those diamond ear-drops,
Dear Mamma's delight;
Through this thin tulle-pleating
Worm their way until
Mv poor heart stops beating
With the deathly chill.
Hark! The brave North-Easter,
Like a blast from Norway,
Howls along the passage,
Whistles through the doorway.
Cringe, ye courtly darlings,
In your robes of snow,
Trimmed with pure white lilao!
Heavens! it does blow!
Even the plump Duchess
In her brocatelle
Finds the draught loo much is,
Though she's oovered well.
Her blue lips she closes.
Her chilled eyelids wink,
And her Roman nose is,
Like her train, shrimp-pink.
Mamma's eye is on me,
Sparkling like a jewel.
Courage I But this wind is
Cruel, cruel, oruel!
Such a scene as this is
Every girl's delight is;
But my throat's so raspy,
And that means bronchitis:
One would rather die
Than not be presented;
But in a North-Easter?
Kingsley was demented!
Yes, the luscious South-wind
Which the goose decries,
Less afflicts our bosoms,
Better suits our eyes.
Why belaud and soften
With his tricky pen
What, alas! too often
Women slays—and men?
Says the soft South-Wester
Is the Ladies' breeze!
Be it so, and let us
Have it, if you please!
But the black North-Easter
Through May's mid-day hurled,
Drives poor English girls by scores
Deathward from' the world."
Drawing-rooms are lovely,
But diaphanous dress
In a May North-Easter
Means—eugh! I can guess
By this inward quivering,
By this bosom-chill:
E'en Mamma is shivering,
Spite of her strong will.
Oh f cannot our mothers
(From the dear Queen down)
Some less killing fashion
Set the foolish Town?
Mode rules strong within us,
But—we 're flesh and blood,
Frozen by what Kingsley
Calls" the wind of God."

CHEVY CHASE.'
New Version of (he old Ballad of Chivalry,
adapted to our unchivalric days.
God prosper long our gracious Queen,
And may no more befall,
So foul a nght as that rude fray,
Which Chevy * Chase we call.
To lead the House, with care and pain,
Grey Gladstone did essay.
The churl may shame that is unborn
The manners of that day.
The suave Sir Stafford to oppose
His devoir did with grace;
A gentler pair of gallant foes
Stood never face to face.
But forth there stepped a cheeky Squire,
Randolpho was his name,
Who cried, " You don't call this a fight.?
Your style is much too tame!
"You shall not fool about like this,
And I stand looking on.
"You be two muffs," Randolpho said,
"I'd lick the pair alone!
"I '11 do the best that do I may,
Although not Old or Grand.
All this punctilio is rot;
I '11 fight for my own hand!"
Then straight arose a vulgar row,
Shaming good hearts and true;
Coarse words like poisoned arrows went,
And smirched where they not Blew,
To still the storm, with broken voice,
Grey Gladstone did his best;
A Captain he of miokle might,
Who never stooped his crest.
Bat howls rose fast on every side,
No courtesy was found;
And yahoo yells of laughter rude.
His struggling accents drowned.
0 Saints! it was great grief to see
How pale he did appear,
Whilst itout and shout lie w." all about,
Rude laugh, and ruthless jeer.
This fight did last till Gladstone grey
Shamed tome of suoh coarse fun.
Hoarse was that voice, erst like a bell,
That long-tried strength foredone.
Lo! conscience pricks the brave Sir Hicks,
A Knight of oourtesie;
On that back bench churl hearts might
blenoh,
And fail of their cad glee.
For Randolpho needs.must I wail
As one in doleful dumps,
Aping the rough who kicks his foe,
And on his body jumps.
Smart Squire, who well might be brave
Knight,
Him pity 'tis to see
Hounding rude clowns on, in despite
Of gallant Chivalry.
Let Irish churls of small account
Thus play the unknightly lout;
Let inarticulate Tory sumpns
Thus rudely yell and shout;
But one of brain and gentle blood
Should deem it less disgrace
Tojoin some Cookney Epping Hunt
Than lead a Chevy Chase!
God save the Queen, and bless the land
With plenty, joy, and peaoe;
And grant henceforth that foul debate

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 18.—Always admired Joseph
Oillis. Proud to be esteemed his friend and confidant. He has
some eccentricities. He is, in short, the kind of Joseph whom in
more lawless times a discriminating family would have sought
opportunities to put in a pit. But genius is ever erratic, and
Joet B. is undoubtedly a genius.
The pride I've always taken in the personal acquaintance of this
remarkable man increased fourfold to-night. Been a lively sitting
for some hours. Randolph having, as he said, spent a melancholy
Sunday morning over Afghan Papers determined to give the House a
miserable Monday night. Accordingly, when Vote on Account comes
on, moves to reduce it by Two Millions. Proceeds thereupon to take
a hop, skip and jump through the papers, which Sunday morning
does not appear to have been long enough for him thoroughly to
master.
Randolph listened to with patience and attention. Gladstone
onoe getting up to correot a statement or ask for a reference, greeted
by the Conservatives with sudden savage howl that startled strangers
in Gallery. Thought someone had been discovered with hands in
somebody else's pocket.
Bnt it was only the
Leader of the House
requesting permission
to interpolate a remark
and the gentlemen of
Conservative party re-
fusing leave.
This nothing to what
followed. When Pbe-

correction, argument,
or assertion. But
Liberals didn't howl
at Randolph, as in-
deed, it isn't custom
on either side to howl

like madmen. _ Old

Here Joseph Gillis was in his element. He howled and groaned
and jeered with the best of them; felt that his moment of triumph
had come. These fine-dressed highborn Gentlemen had sneered at
him because of his former connection with the bacon business, and
because they thought his manners lacked repose. But Joei B.—
devilish sly—had them under his thumb now. They had come down
to his level; nay, he was a Leader amongst them, and now, as the
veteran Statesman, pale and trembling with indignation, stood at
the table with the weight of fifty years' public service on his back,
Joseph Gillis, below the Gangway, competed with Lord Newpoht
and Lord Abthub Hill above, and very nearly outshouted them.
Joey B. is tough as well as sly. Might have been thought excite-
ment of this scene would have worn him out. But he lay by, and
awaited his opportunity. Randolph, having made his speech and
"drawn Gladstone," had no further interest in his Amendment.
Wanted to withdraw it, and let the House go into Committee. Then
Joseph, momentarily forgotten, appeared upon the scene, and created
remarkable sensation.
"Motion by leave withdrawn," says the Speaker.
"No!" roared Joseph Gillis.
Evident he meant to divide. Randolph a plucky man, not accus-
tomed to shrink from consequences. But couldn't stand this prospect.

and fled. Staffobd Noethcote and colleagues on Front Bench
rapidly disappeared in Indian file. Conservatives parted right and
left, whilst Joseph Gillis, with long lean hand supporting pon-
derous head, watched the soene with a pleased smile.
"Think I've scored to-day," he said, modestly, having seen his
eleven supporters through the Division Lobby.
"Yes, Joseph, I think you have."
Business done.—Lord Randolph's Motion to reduce Vote on
Acoount negatived by 74 Votes against 11.
Tuesday.—House of Commons meeting at Four o'Clock. Counted
Out at Six. A great deal happened in interval. First of all, Wabton
repudiated Joseph Gillis. Waeton had moved an Amendment on
Metropolitan Board of Works Bill in debate. Joet B. had uplifted
his powerful voice in support of Wabton's case. When Division
called, Speaker consequently named him as co-teller; whereat, the
House roared with laughter. Wabton didn't see the joke. Privately
protested to the Speakeb. Subsequently took public objection.
Joseph Gillis behaved with calm dignity. Speakeb had called
on him to tell, and he told, regardless of Wabton's spasmodic snuff-
taking, and the violent outstretching of his thumbs, which is with
him a sign of deep emotion.
Secondly, Raikes, raking up story of robbery of cash-box in
House of Commons, puts portentous question.
"Is it," he taid, ''the custom of Members of the Government to
bring to the House
considerable sums in

purpose?"
Lord Richard Gbos-

reply humorously; but

exception, plenty of room on Front Bench, Cavendish Bentinck
takes it. Listens with growing impatience to Broadhurst's
remarks. Growls and groans ineessantly; changes position; hair
visibly rumples itself—to watchful eye, sure sign of coming explo-
sion. At last it comes.
"Nonconformists," eays Bhoadhubst, "have been obliged to
worship in barns."
"Nonsense!" C B. shouts across the House.
Broadhubst mildly suggests that perhaps the Ex-Judge-Advo-
cate-General didn't often attend Nonconformist services in rural
districts. C. B., once wound up for contradiction will go any
lengths. Didn't stop at this. "I do," he cried, emphatically, and
looked angrily round, wanting to know what House was laughing at.
"What a pretty Idyl we have here," said Gibson—" Bentinck in
his Sunday clothes, with hat newly brushed, a copy of the Congrega-
tional Hymn Book in his hand, walking along the leafy lanes in the
early Summer Sabbath morning, bent upon attending service in some
little Conventicle! Talk of Sites for Places of Worship. This, to
me, would be the most touching sight of all."_

Bentinck makes an interesting confession.

Subsequently crossed floor of House, and seating himself by the Sage

the right to vote as a " dole," to be charily dealt out, and withheld
on every possible pretext. If you really knew anything of the short

cant. If the receipt upon any oocasion, and at whatever pinch, of
surgical and medical advice and medicine, is to disqualify a man from
voting, as you, in your wisdom, have, for the time, decided, the
hard-and-fast rule will assuredly act harshly, absurdly, and with
exasperating inequality. Many a decent fellow, "happy " in having
"his quiver full of them," will forfeit a privilege which a bachelor
"bad lot," his neighbour, will retain. 'Tis a twopenny-halfpenny

PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
MY PROFESSIONAL CONNECTION WITH "THE GADFLY"—A
RECOLLECTION OF THE DERBY.
HE fact that we have reaohed
the time on or about of the
Derby festival, reminds
me that some years ago,
when, in fact, I was quite
a beginner at the Bar (I
had scarcely been called
long enough to have quali-
fied for a Metropolitan
Polioe Magistracy), I was
connected with an evening
sporting newspaper called
The Gadfly. When I use
the epithet "sporting," I
do not mean to imply that
the journal was exclusively
given over to the interests
of the turf. On the con-
trary, the Directors (the paper wag worked by a limited liability
company of seven shareholders, all of whom were on the Board, be-
longed to a leading " horsey" Club and were numbers of Tattersall's),
by arrangement with the Editor, had virtually the run of the columns
of their own periodical, and consequently that periodical sometimes
had rather a "patohy" look. I nave known The Gadfly contain
on the same evening articles headed "Latest Sporting," "Plato
oritically considered, "A Week at Hcrne Bay" (written by a
female friend of the daughter of one of the Directors), "How
Buttons are made" (communicated, per contract, by an eminent firm
of advertisers), "Napoleon, an Epio Poem" (supposed to have been
composed by the Managing Director in his salad days—the poetry
consumed three columns of matter, and crowded out the whole of the
Law Intelligence and three-fourths of the Money Market), " How to
Break the Bank at Monte Carlo" (by the Editor himself), and lastly,
in the place of honour, from the pen of the Editor's Maiden Aunt,
from whom he (the said Editor) had expectations, "Peter the Pious
Putney PiemBn— A Story of the Ragged Schools."
Rowland Stoke was the presiding genius of The Gadfly, and it
was through his influence that I was appointed " Standing Counsel to
the Propnetors." My duties were rather vague, and entirely (from
a purely pecuniary point of view) unremnnerative. They ooncisted
ohiefly in "dropping in" at the office between one and two in the
afternoon and having luncheon. To pay my footing, Rowland
8tone, whose chief aim in life was to receive thirteen penoe for a
shilling, used to BUggest that I should " lend a hand in getting the
number out." This phrase usually meant then and there sitting
down and "knocking off" a column or so of copy. On such
occasions I have written "The Paris Letter," "Our Own Corre-
spondent at the Seat of War," "Cloaks and Bonnets for the
Autumn," "Our Latest Scientific Expedition," and even a sporting
prophecy signed " Nimbod." But my favourite contribution was an
epistle from the outside public on such miscellaneous subjects as
''Mushroom Growing," " Vaccination," "Lunoheons at the South
Kensington Museum," "Teething in Children," or "The Condition
of the Artillery at the Tower." When thus engaged, I invariably
signed myself "A Field-Officeb's Widow." Professionally I had
hut one case. The Gadfly managed to libel an Actor, and I was
junior to the accomplished Q..C. who appeared for the Proprietors.
At the last moment my leader failed to turn up to open the case for
the defence, and consequently the duty devolved upon me. I had
not seen the Dramatic Critio of the paper (who was to be my prin-
cipal witness), but had merely been told by Rowland Stone that
"he had got him cheap because of his youth, but he had one fault—
he waB always coming to blows with a lad about his own age—the
Sub-Editor." Furnished with this information I lauded my witness
up to the skies, pointing out that both Pitt and Napoleon were
young men when they were entrusted with offices of the utmost
responsibility and importance. I finished mv peroration with these
impressive words, "Yes, Gentlemen of the Jury, if it is said that
the Dramatic Critic of this paper, John Wellington Blotts, is in
early, too early manhood, then I will say that also was ' the heaven-
horn Premier of this mighty Empire in early, too early manhood,
that the Corsican artillery officer who was to rule Europe—yes, and
Egypt—was also in early, too early manhood. Nay, Hercules himself
when he strangled the two serpents in his cradle—a feat the
Dramatic Critio of The Gadfly has imitated by slaying the twin
snakes of imperfect rehearsal and indistinctness of utterance"—
this was a reference to the libel complained of—" was also in early—
too early—the very earliest manhood—call Mr. John Wellington
Blotts!" Upon which a small boy of about fifteen, with a swollen
nose and a black eye, was handed into the witness box 1
It was on a Derby Eve a few years tince that I lounged into the
Board-room of The Gadfly, about 1 p.m., to find, to my chagrin,
instead of a luncheon, a full meeting of the Directors. To my sur-
prise, I was reoeived with much cordiality.
"The very fellow we wanted," cried Rowland Stone, who had in
his hand a copy of Every Man hit Own Lawyer, which, apparently,
he had just been consulting. "You can tell us all about it, as our
Standing Counsel."
Gratined to find that I was at length called upon to appear in my
real character as a member of a most honourable profession, instead of
the reluctantly-assumed personality of a " Field-Officer's Widow,"
I tat down with dignity, and listened with the utmost gravity.
"All the available capital of The Gadfly is £1247 it. id.," said
one of the Directors.
I bowed my head acquiescently.
"We must get some more or we shall shut up," added a second.
Again I made an inclination.
"Pipeclay is at 12 to I, and we happen to know it's a oertainty,"
observed a third Director.
I stared, for interesting as this speoial piece of information might
be at such a time (just before the Derby), it did not seem to have
much to do with the financial position of The Gadfly.
"In fact," cried Rowland Stone, "we have all of us determined
to put every penny in the Bank to the account of the paper on Pipe-
clay, and see what comes of it. I suppose there's nothing in the
Companies' Act to prevent us?"
I was flabbergasted. Imperfectly acquainted as I was with the
statute in question, I yet insisted that the Legislature could never
have intended to sanction such a dealing as that contemplated by the
Directors with trust funds. I was in the middle of a most eloquent
oration, when a sporting-looking individual, whom I subsequently
recognised as the furnisher of The Latest Odds," rushed into the
room in some excitement.
"Gentlemen," he cried, exultingly, "I have done the trick! I
have put on every blessed penny in the Bank for you on Pipeclay at
13 to 11"
After this declaration (which was reoeived with the wildest enthu-
siasm) of a financial policy which I could not indorse with my
professional sanction, there was but one thing for me to do-to
retire. I retired.
This was my last appearance as Standing Counsel for The Gadfly.
The next day Pipeclay ran second for the Derby, and the thutters
of The Gadfly office were put up, so far as that periodical was con-
cerned, for tver 1

AU REVOIE!
[Mr. James Russell Lowell, in finishing his speech at the
unveiling of the bust of Gray at Pembroke College, Cambridge,
said that "This would in all probability be the last occasion on
which he would have the opportunity of addressing Englishmen
in public. He wished, therefore, to express his most heartfelt
gratitude for the kindness which had Burrounded him for the
last four years in his official and in his private life, and had
made both delightful. He had come among them as a far-away
cousin, and they were sending him away as something very like
a brother."]
Send you away? No, Lowell, no,
That phrase indeed is scarce well-chosen.
"We 're glad, of course, to have you go

But what we all should like the best
Would be to keep you here for ever.
You've won our hearts; your words your ways
Are what we like. Without desiring

DUST AND DUTY;
OR, HOW TO DO IT.
Sib,—As a great deal of exaggerated nonsense has appeared in the
columns of one of your contemporaries on the subjeot of Unemptied
Dust-bins," and the obstacles that lie in the path of the Householder
anxious to escape the mischief arising from the habitual neglect of
the Parish Authorities to pay any attention to their condition, I sub-
join, for the benefit of your readers, a brief code comprising a few
simple rules that, if acted upon, will be found effectually to dispose
of the difficulty. They are taken from that admirable little work,
A Hundred Wayt of making a Houte Uninhabitable; and I may
add that, from some personal experience, I canjvouch for their com-
plete efficacy. They are as follows:—
Your Dust-bin having through a negleot, let~us say, of seven or
eight weeks, during which period you have given a series of convivial
bad lobster-suppers, purchased a considerable quantity of uneatable
damaged tinned rabbit, and taken, experimentally, with all your
family to Vegetarianism,—become so unbearable that while you and
your friends faint (suffocated under your own portico), all your
neighbours for five doors on each side of you, as well as the proprie-
tors of the four houses immediately opposite you on the other side of
the way, have either taken or threatened to take proceedings against
you under the Nuisances Removal Act, you will, especially' if the
thermometer be over 80°, communicate, at first gently, but after the
ninth unanswered appeal, finally with some urgency, yet not impo-
litely, with the Sanitary Inspector.
Failing, as you will, to get any'help, response, or even sign of
existence from this official, and after having hotly pursued several
loaded Dust-carts, to be jeered at and worsted in a fruitless effort at
repartee with their owners, you will now either,—
(1) Write to the Timet, sub-acidly, under a funny nom-de-plume.
(2) Strangle the Clerk to the Vestry in his own office.
(3) Hire a wheelbarrow, and empty your own Dust-bin, by separate
and stealthy journeys, at midnight, into the Serpentine, or an adja-
cent square;
(4) Blow up your area with dynamite.
(5) Leave matters to take their oourse, and emigrate; or
(6) Put the whole affair into the hands of your family Solicitors.
This last is, perhaps, the best and safest course; and, having
deoided upon it, you will now rapidly find yourself plunged into a
state of litigation, of a charaoter so active and absorbing, that, not-
withstanding the fact that the condition of your Dust-bin is, by this
time, positively deadly, and that the whole of your household are
down with an acute suburban form of Roman fever, you will find
your energies, though highly morbid, stimulated to a very remark-
able degree, and for this reason: At this stage of the proceedings,
the successful issue of sixteen cross-actions against you will,
under the decree of a Superior Court, finally obtained after several
reversals of judgment, oblige you either to—
(A) Build a Gimmerton's patent universal self-consuming furnace
over your Dust-bin, and get an Act of Parliament to enable you to
carry up a factory chimney Beventy-five feet above the roof of your
house, tor the purpose of disposing of the noxious vapours:
(B) Fill in your area with quick lime and turn it into a public
pleasure garden:
(C) Employ three watering-carts day and night in sprinkling the
whole of the street with unmixed carbolic acid:
(D) Horsewhip all the Members of the Vestry, either collectively
or singly, together with the Deputy Chairman of the Board of
Works, in the hope of attracting the attention of the publio to the
matter by meanB of a sensational Police Court case: or,
(E) Let the entire matter, regardless of all financial considerations,
go up bodily to the House of Lords.
The last will, on the whole, be found the wisest thing to do, and
though judgment will as a matter of course go against you, and you
will find yourself—with your Dust-bin still unemptied— saddled,
with a bill of costs so heavy aa to oblige you to appeal for protection
to the Court of Bankruptcy, you will nevertheless nave the satisfac-
tion of knowing that you have done everything in your power to
proteot the sanitary interests of yourself and your neighbours,
vindicate your rights as a British Householder.

MYSTERY SOLVED! WHAT PRINCE B-SM-RCK AND LORD R-S-B-RY WERE REALLY DISCUSSING.
To sum up your final position. You will discover that by being
ultimately forced by disastrous circumstances out of your own house,
you will practically have (rot rid of responsibility for your dust.
Your Dust-bin will not be emptied, but your premises will be. This
is not much; still, it is something, and it is, at least as the Law now
stands, the only practicable method .of delivering you from the cruel
trammels of a Stygian Bumbledom. Your obedient Servant,
A Spirited Ratepayer.
Sir,—It is incorrect to say that there is no remedy where a Vestry
fails to clear out a Du9t-bin at regular intervals. All that has to be
done is for the Householder to go to a Solicitor, who will instruct a
Barrister to go to the Court of Chancery and ask for a mandamus to
the Dost Contractor, which will probably be refused on the ground
that it is the Vestry which is responsible. In that event, nothing
can be simpler than carrying the case on to the Appeal Court and
the House of Lords. A barrister friend of mine says he would have
no hesitation in "fighting the case" in every Court—in fact, the
more Courts the better.
The Householder may, if he likes to try the experiment, sue the
Vestry to begin with. This will take some little time, but it can be
done. Then there will be a little pleasurable uncertainty about
whether the Police Court, the County Court, the County Magistrates,
or the High Court of Justice is the correct tribunal to consult. After
one or two possible failures on this point, and then hanging about
the Court for days on the chance of his case coming on, the House-
holder may in the end recover about thirty shillings, at a cost to him-
self (for legal expenses) of two or three hundred pounds. There is
nothing at all abstruse about these proceedings. I hope that some-
body else may be induced to try them, who, like myself, is
An Indignant Ratepayer.
Sir,—The only way to have your Du9t-bin properly cleared out is
to do it yourself. Yours, &c, Julius Scavenger.
Sir,—The outcry against the Vestries for not clearing out Dust-
bins, is incomprehensible to me. /never have the least difficulty in
getting the duBtmen to como to my house. My Cook always gives
the poor hard-worked fellows as much beer as they like, and some
bread and cheese to take away with them, and I myself never fail to
give them a shilling each for their trouble. As to their ever being
impolite, or hurrying over their work, as your Correspondents allege,
I cannot believe it. They are always most civil and polite to me.
They invariably call twice a week, and stay quite a long time in the
kitchen. Amelia Coddlem.
Sir,—When will the British people understand that Feudalism is
at the root of Foul Dust-bins Y A good Radical Government, suoh
as England wants, would clear out the Vestries and the Dust-bins
together, and probably the pampered Householders who indulge in
such luxuries, to boot. If our Ministry would abandon India and all
our Colonies, and go to the country with the "Nationalisation of
Dust-bins" insoribed on their Hag, they would be certain to march to
Victory.
Sib,—It may be of interest to your readers to know that Du9t-bias
have already formed the subject of several legal decisions. For

Jenning's Case it was decided that the averment that " the tenant by
assault and battery— videlicet, 'earing in his head'—did drive away
the Dust Contractor," was a good answer to a petition to have that
official hung at Tyburn. The question of whether a man has any
right to claim damages against a Vestry that has wilfully neglected
to clean out his Dust-bin, and thus lea to five deaths from typhus
fever in his family, was unanimously answered in the negative (with
costs) by the House of Lords twenty years ago, on which occasion
Lord Slowcoach gave utterance to this highly interesting obiter
dictum :—" A Dust-bin is a receptacle, or reservoir, or chamber for
the storing of dust. The Court will look with a jealous eye on the
attempt to make dust include ashes and cabbage-stalks and little
bits of coal." I think these quotations will show that our Law is
quite alive to the question of Dust-bins, and that if anybody wants
to bring an action against his local Vestry, he cannot do better than
apply without delay to Your obedient Servant,
Middling Templar.
ADVICE TO M.P.'S.
The new American Minister's amusing letter of advice to his
friend, who had just been elected a Member for Congress, may be
Anglicised thus,—for M.P.'s:—
1. Always assist a Count Out, and always vote in favour of an
Adjournment, and for the longest possible time.
2. Vote steadily against all other propositions whatsoever. There
is already legislation enough for the next five hundred years, and no
honest man wants any more. Even a Bill for the Disfranchisement
of Diseased Ploughmen should form no exception to this rule.
3. Make no speeches: nobody attends to Parliamentary oratory
when delivered. When printed, nobody reads it, and it is a nuisance
to the newspapers. I never read any.
4. Do not allow yourself to be drawn into aspersions upon the
memory of Grrr Fa wees. He has been much censured by shallow
men. History in the end will do him justice. Before you nave been
long in Parliament, you will perceive that one such man nowadays.
with better luck, might do the country more service than a hundred
Reform Bills or two hundred Cabinet Ministers.
5. Do not be seen much in public in the company of Republicans.
In this old country they are not, as a rule, savoury.
6. Cultivate assiduously all Newspaper Correspondents. All there
is of public life is what the newspapers say, and they will say any-
thing that is worth their while.
7. In case of doubt, take the trick.
8. Keep your nostrils open, your mouth shut, your hand cool, and
your feet warm. Avoid Irish Whiskey, Charles Bradlaugh, the
game of brag, and the Law Courts in an East wind.
9. Whatever happens, do not relinquish hope. As Cicero observes.
Nil desperandum. You have onoe been a respectable member of
society; resolve to regain that position. Live for the future, and
live down the present.
SHIP-SHAPE; OR, NOTHING LIKE ACTION.
(Being a few Hints for the next Battle or Trafalgar.)
There having, in well-informed and influential quarters, been
expressed some very grave and not unfounded doubts as to the capa-
bility of the heterogeneous agglomeration of vessels now about,
under the euphonious title of the " Channel Fleet," to proceed to sea
with Admiral Hornby, to encounter any properly-equipped enemy,
the following brief but reassuring set of Regulations, drawn up
"for his guidance and direction" by a distinguished and competent
Admiralty official, will be read on all sides with lively interest.
1. On an enemy of great superior force being sighted, and it being
important that utmost speed should be used, either to withdraw or
for the purpose of securing an advantageous position, the vessels of
the Bumble, Deadweight, Sloth, and Sponger class, that can only
make four knots an hour in fair weather, will give the pace to the
rest of the Fleet.
2. The Fleet under these conditions finding itself the next morning
out-manoeuvred and surrounded by hostile squadrons preparing for
attack, the Admiral in command will without further delay—
(a) Telegraph, as well as he can under the circumstances, to the
Admiralty for several torpedo crinolines;
(b) Send a copy of Sir Thomas Brassey's latest account of the
state of the British Navy, as it appears "on paper," to the
opposing Admiral, requesting him, with his best compli-
ments, to read it, and reflect what he may be about; " and
(c) In view of the possibility of this last not inducing his oppo-
nent immediately to retire, endeavour to rouse the enthu-
siasm of his own men by an appropriate order of the day.
3. The best signal he can then run up will undoubtedly be Nelson's
immortal "England expect* that every man this day will do hi*
duty." This he should lose no time in displaying, inserting, if he
think it an improvement, either the words " atutual or "probably"
between " England" and " expects."
4. After reoeiving from every ship the inevitable answer, " We will
d> our belt, under the circumstance*—but we really don't think much
will come of it," he can, perhaps, just capping this with the inspirit-
ing rejoinder, "Never mind—no more do I," proceed to draw np
his plan of the coming engagement.
5. This he will speedily develop as follows. Not having under his
command a scientifically appointed fleet, capable of any combined
aotion, but merely a naval rabble, he will, after much reflection,
finally settled by a toss-up with a halfpenny for the best oat of
three in the engine-room, decide to let matters comfortably take
their course, and signal to his Captains briefly—" Fire atoay!
Every man for himself, and good luck to him J"
6. In the course of thirteen minutes, hearing that half of his
miscellaneous naval force has been blown up by its own obsolete
guns, while the rest has quietly but swiftly disappeared beneath the
water, he will, on its being announoed to him unofficially that one
of the enemy's British-made Torpedos has successfully effected its
purpose of making a hole, thirty-eight feet square, in the bottom of
his own Flag-ship, go down like a man, singing " Rule"'
cheerily in a minor key.

THE BUTLERS OF GREAT MEN.
(Interviewed by Our Own Sack-stairs Representative.)
No. V.—At the Last of the Basons.
The sun had been shining very strongly, and I had been walking: very sharply; and the result
was, when I arrived at the residential castle inhabited by the Last of the Barons, I was, not to put
it too mildly, preoions hot. But, hot as I was before I entered Sir John's, "hot" was not
the word afterwards. I knocked at the back entrance, the Baron's portcullis was raised instan-
taneously, and the door was opened like a flash of lightning; the Baron's Retainers,—he has
had a lot of 'em in his time with his briefs, but I don't mean thetn, I mean the Butler and one of the
Footmen,—seized me by the arms, hauled me into the passage before I could breathe, slammed the
door, and pulled two massive velvet curtains over it. When I recovered myself, and before I
even said, How do you do?" I exclaimed, "What's up?" The Butler replied, "Nothing—we
have to be careful of the draughts."
"What," I asked, "has the Cook got a cold?"
"No," replied he, "Lor' no—no chanoo of catching oold here. The Baron is so susceptible to
fresh air, we have even to bung up the larder window."
I took a glance round, and saw that the whole of the extensive stone passages were lined with
thick damask curtains. The keyholes were all stopped up; sand-bags were on the closed windows;
the doors were all edged with felt, and the place was just like an oven. I could not help remarking
that the place was insufferably hot; and the Butler replied that, in comparison with the upper part
of the house, it was an ice-safe. I said—" Does not the Baron ever get any fresh air?"
"Oh, yes," replied the Baron's Butler, "he gets more than he wants at the Law Courts. It's
very difficult to keep out the draughts here. Now, at his Lordship's place at Ascot it's easier
he has enclosed his house in a gigantic conservatory."
With these observations I was shown into the Butler's pantry, where a nice little meal was
prepared for me. I said, "I suppose you really see very little of the Baron f"
In what way?" inquired the Butler.
"I mean," I explained, "his Lordship must be occupied in Court all day, and the seriousness of
his work, and the importance of his decisions and judgments, must keep him locked up at home all
night."
"Oh, no," replied the Bntler, "he's not that sort of man. He is delightful and cheerful to a
degree. The decisions and judgments don't bother him'much. His jokes do, though. He has an
awful trouble to get them up. He's quite grateful when I casually ' let off' a little thing of my
own, for he will always adopt it, and I have the gratification of seeing it in print next day. When
the great sculpture case was on, I said to him, 'I suppose, Sir John, you will not be sorry when
that case is bust up?' The Baron thanked me very much, and he used the joke the next day, and
the Times report said there were " roars of laughter in Court, which were with difficulty suppressed."
I could not help remarking that such simplicity in the Last of the Barons was surprising to me
The Butler said, "Oh 1 his life out of Court is as innocent as a boy's. When he is at Ascot, it is a
innocent as a child's. Give him a
French book and a dictionary, and
he '11 be happy all day. In August, if
it happens io be broiling hot, he will
put on a thick ulster and a respirator
and go on the Virginia Water in a
punt, and sum up to the sticklebacks.
He loves fishing.
I concluded my interview, and as
I ascended the kitchen steps, having
been shot out of the place as rapidly
as I was lugged in, 1 could not help
thinking (to alter the adage) how
little things please great minds.
THE SEASON.
The season's set in, my fair Ladies,
Now don the gay bonnet and gown,
The country quite thrown in the
shade is
By all the delights of the town.
And Phyllis intent upon pleasure.
Leaves Cobydon lone in the land,
To come up and tread a gay measure,
To Liddell's enjoyable band.
The season's beginning, and heavy
The programme put down for each
day,
Your brothers are off to the levee,
The drawing-room sees your array.
They 're busy with "spotting the
winners,"
And laying a hundred to ten,
They dote upon dishes and dinners,
You think about women and men.
The season's beginning, and pleasant
Your fair and prophetical dreams,
How is it to youth all the present,
So perfectly beautiful seems.
And doubtless new triumphs await
you,
At dinner or supper or ball,
That haply unduly elate you,
At holding poor fellows in thrall.
The season's beginning, suppose a
Fair maiden can music enjoy.
Old Drury can give you Carl Rosa,
And Suluvak '8 at the Savoy.
Each theatre claims your attention,
Or else you can visit at night,
South Kensington's home of Inven-
tion,
And revel in fountains and light.
The season's beginning, high-hearted
The debutantes rush to the fray,
The long round of gaiety's started,
That rouses our London in May.
Ah! ladies you, certes, have reasons,
To think that no pleasures can cloy
For know that the best of all seasons,
Is always the first you enjoy.

THE JOCKEY CLUB STAND AT THE NEWMARKET SECOND SPRING MEETING.
NOTES BY NIBBS.
(To Paris, and back to London.)
I wosdm what French Artists would do without "the Tempta-
tion of St. Anthony P" The recurrence, year after year, of several
examples of this dish dressed up, or, rather, undressed up, in various
ways suggests the idea that French painters have a rule to guide them
when hard up for a subject, which might be formulated thus:—
Happy Thought.—When in doubt,—paint the Temptation of St.
Anthony. [Bonne Idee.—Dans le doute, va pour la Tentation de
S. Anliline.
There are the usual number of them this year. On the whole the
Salon compares favourably with our Academy, especially in the
rirtraits and landscapes. If the suggestion is ever made to me,"
was observing, "that I should have my portrait painted and pay
for it myself, I should certainly come to Paris and get it done by
one of these French Artists."
Scarcely were the words out of my mouth, than a friend at my
elbow said, "Your portrait has been painted by a Frenoh Artist,
look there 1" I turned and saw my own portrait on the wall. There
I was, no doubt of it,—only it wasn't myself of to-day, but of—to be
particular to a date,—myself about seven years ago. My coat, my
tie, my waistcoat, my continuations discontinued at the knees—it
was a three-quarter length,—" to be continued in our next,"—were
all there. Who was it? I had never been taken alive by any
Frenchman. Clearly it must be somebody else, and so I turned to
the Catalogue for an explanation.
Now comes the still more remarkable part of the story. The gentle-
man's surname, whatever it might have been, was only represented
by asterisks, but the initials of his Christian names were there, and
they were mine. It was a staggerer, but we got over it and went to
breakfast at Ledoyen's, where we discussed coincidences.
Victor Hugo's death must have made little fortunes for the news-
vendors and sellers of the photographs of the deceased Poet. Of the
Communist row at the cemetery we only read the news in the
evening papers; but, as compared with the Poet's death, it caused
no great stir. On the boulevards the talk, when not about Victor
Hugo, was of Chant illy Races and coming sporting events.
On Whit Monday the Pantheon was crowded with sight-seers, as
if they were having a last look at it before its* laicisation. Of
course this question of interment is a domestic one for the Frenoh;
but why the remains of Victor Hugo should not be placed in the
vaults of the church, without any religious ceremony, as even a
leading " Clerical" proposed, is to my insular mind a puzzle.
Supposing we had an English Victor Hugo, holding the opinions of
Mr. Bkaslaugh, would his dust—(odd that a question of distin-
guished dust should be agitating the Parisians, while in the Times
we are discussing what to do with the ordinary Dust-bins)—be per-
mitted to rest m Westminster Abbey? Certainly. The Public
would demand it of the Dean, the Dean would write to the Times,
and would concede with a good grace. There would be no religious
ceremony, someone would make a speech, in the Chapter House,
on the catholicity of Genius; the Urn, duly labelled, would be
placed on a Pedestal—and the whole thing would be forgotten for
the next hundred years or so, when some fussy people might be
looking about for material for a Centenary.
The weather in Paris up to Whitsun Tuesday would have been a
disgrace to London. The atmosphere was revolutionary, and sun-
shine and rain struggled for the mastery, the latter getting the best

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
of it in the end. No out-of-door amusements; we were driven to
the Theatres.
When Madame Sarah Bernhardt oomes over here to play
Thiodora at the Gaiety in July, I advise all amateurs and students
of the art of aoting to see her performance. I have never been more
struck by the histrionio genius of Sarah Bernhardt than on seeing
her as Theodora, Cirous-dancer, Adventuress, and Empress. 1 oan-
not imagine anyone else playing this part which was written for her
by that master of his craft, M. Victoriew Sardou. The powerful
situation in Ftdora seems to have set the Author casting about for
something similar. Fidora was the impassioned mistress and the
spy, the traitress, the destroyer of her lover's brother, of his dearest
kin, and his love was changed into the deadliest hatred. So is it
with Thiodora and Andreas, the latter part being rendered with
true dramatic force by M. Marais.
I trust, for the sake of the ensemble, that, at the Gaiety, with
Sarah Bernhardt we shall have Marais as Andrias, Volny. as
MarceUus, Garnirr as Justinien,—a marvellous reproduction of
the typical Roman Emperor,— and Marie Laurent as Tamyris.
1 have been informed that 1 was fortunate in seeing Sarah B.
playing so well, as, being a caprioious lady, she will sometimes
"walk through the part," and laugh and talk on the stage. I hope
this is calumny: and, as far as my testimony goes, I oan only say
that 1 saw Theodora twice, and that the second time she played, it
possible, better than on my first visit.
The stage-management,—with the exception of the view of the
Burning Palace,—is throughout good; but not on a par with what
we oan show at the Lyceum under the present management, nor at
the establishment ruled by Augustus Druriolanus. The m»«e-ef>-
scene does not come within measurable distance, for example, of the
last scene in The Cup. The fault of the principals, Sarah excepted,
lies in their too frequently striding, or rushing down into the right
or left-hand oorner, and then back again to the centre, without any
sort of reason for the movement.
At the Theatre Francaif, in the charmingly written and most
interesting comedy, Denise, the same fault is still more patent, as it
must be where the Actors are in modern costume representing men
and women of our own day, for whom no allowance oan be made on
the score of classio aotion. The Aotors in Denise have the whole
stage, representing a handsomely furnished room in a country-house,
to play in, yet they choose to occupy mainly a few feet in front just
behind the footlights, and to carry on the action, whether sitting or
standing, more or less in a straight line; and when energy has to be
exhibited, the speaker rushes down to the stage-left, demonstrates
vigorously, and returns to the centre, or thereabouts. But their
freat merit, whether at the Francais, or at any other leading
heatre in Paris, is that the principals act and speak to one another
apparently regardless of the audienoe, who, in consequence, beoome
interested not as spectators conscious of having paid to be amused,
but as on-lookers in a orowd, as sympathising with the sufferings
of the personages whose story they are following, but whose destiny
they are unable to change even by the turning of a thumb. When-
ever an Actor, whether comedian or tragedian, directly addresses the
audienoe, the spell is broken; the beings before you are no loDger
human beings, they are only puppets which will move when money is
dropped into the box, or into tbe pit and the gallery as you will. In
Pans this is the one fault of the popular low comedians, with whom
it is a tradition to take the groundlings into their confidence. But
with Sarah and the first-class Actors playing high comedy, this is
not so; they, for the time, are the characters they assume, and the
mechanism is never apparent.
To come fresh from seeing so thrilling a piece as Thiodora,—by
the way, Mr. Irving could play Justinian in this, and be a formid-
able rival of M. Garnier,—and from suoh interesting plays as Prince
Zilah and Denise, to the goody-goody twaddle and the inaotion of The
Vicar of Wakefield at the Lyoeum, is indeed a change. Of course at
the Lyoeum the mise-en-scei.e is very perf eot and pioturesque. Young
Squire ThornhiU must be a most enthusiastic sportsman, as, while the
apples are still on the trees, and the whole country apparently in
the full glow of a warm autumn or a second summer, he dresses
in full hunting costume, and boasts of hunting the fox all day.
Now, this must be in September, as Christmas-Eve is three months
afterwards, and even cub-hunting, which takes plaoe at an unearthly
early hour, would hardly be continued throughout the day. But
then the young Squire is suoh a scoundrel that perhaps Mr. Wills
has introduced this little bit of strong colour into the dialogue as
only one of his lies to impose on Olivia and account for his absenoe.
At the end he is received and pardoned by his viotim, who quite
forgets, as do the rest of the Vicar's goody-goody and rather
snobbishly-inclined family, his previous odious character, and his
rascally conduct to that other girl whom he had ruined before he
became enamoured of Olivia. The Play—if in its present form it oan
be properly called a Play—was far too long, and too preachy. Sinoe
the first night it has been considerably compressed.
Oliver Goldsmith's story of The Vicar of Wakefield is immortal;
but Oliver did not write Olivia, whioh is an imitation in
theatrical tin-foil of the work wrought by a rare Goldsmith in the
most precious metal. The First Aot was bright and promising; the
performance of the remaining three Aots was not up to the promise.
Throughout there seemed to be no call on the powers of the Actors,
and on the first night none of them, except Mr. Terriss, came up to
what should be their own standard of excellence. I should say,
indeed, I should hope, that they disappointed themselves. I know
they disappointed me. And the gush about it in the so-called
"criticisms " next day!
To return to Paris—ah, how, in this present fine weather I wish I
could!—there are some things theatrical we manage better in
London, and one of them is "the front of the house. The audi-
torium at almost all our theatres is luxurious compared with the
best of them in Paris. And then the worry by the ouvreutes there
about the coats and hats and little wooden stools! The system of
"No Fees," inaugurated here by Mr. John Hollingshead, is un-
known in Paris. However, as long as their uncomfortable, ill-
ventilated, and dirty houses are orowded, the Parisian Managers
are wise to leave things as they are. To put it in OUendorffian
fashion, "We have the good theatres, but we have not the
neighbours' good acting (i.e., the good acting of the neighbours),"
and so, as far as the stage is concerned, they have the best of it,
after all.
A propos of our lively neighbours, on Whit Monday I went to see
ATo» Pelitts Voitinet at the Palais Royal, but on arriving I found the
theatre olosed, because the chandelier, having been let down, couldn't
be got up again, and as Whit Monday was a holiday, there was no
practical person to be obtained who could repair the damaged mecha-
nism. This seems rather bad management. The money was handed
back, and the seats booked for another night.
Distinguished Amateurs are playing at the Olympic. Included in
the list of Amateurs are Mrs. Beerbohm-Tree and Mr. Samuel
Brakdram. If these two are Amateurs, then perhaps Mrs. Bancroft
and Mr. Cornet Grain may also figure in the next non-professional
performances. In the announcement of cricket matches it is not
unusual to read " The Eleven of Dingley Dell, with two professionals."
This would have been more correct in the Olympic programme.
An example of what can be done in the way of a big scenic effect
on a small stage, may be seen any night in the Great Tay-Kin at
Toole's Theatre. This musical trifle might very well be a Fourth
Act of The Shuttlecock, though, for the matter of that, anything
might be the Fourth Act of The Shuttlecock. Nibbs,
"What to do with the nude pictures!" exclaimed the " British
Matron's" Sister, indignantly,—" change them for something else."
"Or," suggested a youthful Artist, " simply shift them." He wasn't
asked to five o'clock tea again.

PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE EXTRAORDINARY.
By Our Own Special Correspondent.
It is said that other of our great Advertising Manufacturers,
determined not to be left behind in the great race for notoriety, have
resolved to imitate Mr. Maple Durham by seeking the high and dis-
tinguished honour of a seat in probably the Lowest House of Parlia-
ment of modern times.
Mr. Blackley will, we hear it whispered, seek the suffrages of
the men of bayswater, whom he promises to universally provide
with all that the Law allows.
Messrs. Apples, it is said, will start their senior Member for
Bloomsbury, and wash their hands of all further testimonials than
those so bounteously supplied by Nightingales, Lilies, and Roses, as
to the complexion in which they with him to be regarded.
Mr. Coalman announces that having mustered his _ friends in
Norwich, they have unanimously resolved that he, like his pure con-
diment, is the best" man for their money.
Mr. Lowlamp would like to represent the new district of Low
Holb .ru, but will first consult the Attorney-General as to the
legality of his presenting each eleetor with a bottle of Pyroteohnio
Saline immediately after the Elec'ion.
Mr. Treelowkr has addressed the Electors of Kidderminster. In
reply to one of them who wrote, "It seems, from your address, that
you are a Liberal," he replied, in the words of HamUt, " ' Seams! I
know not seams,' all my carpets being stamless; but my address is
generally admired, especially by the Ladies. To you and buch as
you, it is Ludgate Hill."
Mr. Akgosy, having braced himself up to the proper pitch, and
put the finishing buckle to his oelebrafc d Braors, thinks of now
offering himself to Ware'em. ThiB is irenerally cou-idered to be such
a Hue manly specimen of sell-sacrifice iu a great cause, that his

Mr Heknows had some idea of going in for P umstead, but found,
on inquurv, that the electors of that ripe district had a natural repug-
nance to Salt Fruit. However, after a friendly conference, it has
been decided to submit his remedy for nearly every disease " that

suffering from such trifling matters as gout, rheumatism, scarlet
fever, biliousness, eruptions, acidity, &c, &v., will be submitted to
its healthful influences, and the result reported iu due course.

DON'T CARE.
Mb. Trevelyan, addressing his constituents at Galashiels, is reported to have spoken as
follows: —
"The truth is that, when you talk to a hard-working Scotchman, or Welshman, or Englishman,
about Mcry and Cyprus, and the necessity of keeping the Germans out of Africa, and the necessity of
keeping Russia out of ABia Minor, and the necessity of keeping the Bulgarians out of Macedonia, with the
view of making him a Conservative, you are talking to him about matters for which he cares very little."
And this indifference to what are known as "Foreign Affairs" Mr. Trevelyan appears
to approve. But does Mr. Trevelyan remember the Schoolbook history of "Don't Care?"
"Don't Care" came to grief, and was ultimately eaten by Lions, was he not? There are
plenty of " Lions in the way" abroad, as well as at home, unfortunately; and if Mr. Tre-
velyan's "hard-working" Briton persists in ignoring them, they will eat" him as sure as
teeth are teeth, and ostriches not birds of wisdom. So sensible and temperate a politician
as Mr. Trevelyan should "teach our
masters" better things than this purblind
twaddle. Because the Conservatives sacri-
fice Home Interests to Foreign Affairs, must
the Liberals cap their stupidity by ignoring
Foreign Affairs in short-sighted absorption
in Home Interests? And what are Foreign
Affairs? Nothing that concerns the inter-
est, safety, or honour of this country, is
really "foreign." Our real "Home In-
terests" may be as much at stake in Merv
as in Middlesex, at Alexandria as at Gala-
shiels. Mr. Trevelyajt knows this as well
as anybody. Why, then, encourage the
"hard-working" but half-instructed Voter
in a contrary belief? The duty of the day
is to teach the Electors to take an intelli-
gent, dispassionate, fair-minded interest in
these same Foreign Affairs. This will supply
the true check to blind muddles, as well
as to bellioose outbursts, to intemperate
Jingoism, as well as to blundering laissez-
faire. It is the timid temporising of the
Trevklyaks which lends what power it
possesses to the clamorous Chauvinism of
the Asm!ea d - B artletts.

Of subtlest sub-acidity;

That later Limbo, crystal-clear,
Whither no fumes of earth-fray mount;
Where lolling sage and lounging seer
Draw wisdom from its upper fount,
To sprinkle on our dusty way
In sparse but most pellucid spray.
There Grey and Spencer gravely sit,
Unerring Austin, there lolls he,
On abstract principles and wit.

Their blameless bosoms!—gather round

Not saccharine only will abound,
But, as at Russdom's teas, you '11 find
The twang of lemon, juice or rind;—
E'en so not " merum nectar" sole
Crowns that bland board in Limbo laid;
There tones, there permeates the whole,
The tart, the mordant lemon-aid;
That lends such pungent, piquant zest
To the repast of each rare guest.
No vitriol-throwers, these dear dames

No envious thoughts of larger fames
Their sad superior bosoms vex:
Only, in their Olympian brew,
The lemon-dash they overdo!

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTHAtTF.D FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Thursday, June 4. — Members met again
to-night after Whitsun Recess. At least some of them did. Amongst
absentees, Stafford Nobthcotk and Christopher Sykes.
"No," said Christopher, whom I accidentally met at Epsom.
"Shan't be there to-morrow. Leave it over to Monday at earliest.
Most exhausting this rush of politios. Don't know how you stand
it, Toby, but sometimes threatens to kill me. Suppose it s because
of intense mental application. Some people take their politics lightly.
To me very serious business. Lie awake at night thinking of my
country. Must take a rest sometimes, and House must get on with-
out me for day or two. Thought I'd take a drive out into the
country to-day. What a lot of people, and, 'pon my soul, there's a
string of horses!" And Christopher, drawing on the other straw-
coloured glove, walked off with long slow Btride.
Randolph is here, none the worse for his hour-and-half speech
last night, whatever weaker vessels among the audience may be.
Gladstone here, too, looking more as if the holidays should begin
to-morrow than as if they had ended yesterday. Dilke, who has
had no holiday, looking best of all. Chamberlain, with eye-glass in
eye, and orchid in button-hole, cruising about the Bar, staring down
at Treasury .Bench, apparently trying to focus it from all points of
view.
"Qu'avez-vous t" I asked, thinking as he'd just come back from
Paris, French language would be most familiar to him. Quick as
lightning he capped the quotation from Ollendorff.
Je n'ai rien. The faot is I'm trying to get a look at Gladstone
from a distance. I sometimes think that great men are like great
mountains, and that we do not appreciate their magnitude whilst we
are still close to them. We have to go to a distance to see which
peak it is that towers above his fellows. Even from here I recognise
that Gladstone is a bigger man than Shaw-Lefevre.''
Quite a return of interesting invalids. Henry Lennox back
again, gracefully ambling round and receiving felicitations on his
return to public life.
"All very well once a Session," growls Randolph, with whom
Lennox insists upon effusively snaking hands, making the while a
fascinating little _ curtsey. "But Lennox is always lying up and
coming back smirking and shaking hands all round as if he'd
been to the Soudan or the North Pole. And what in Heaven's name
does the man mean by turning up his trousers on a hot J one day
when there isn't a thimbleful of mud in the Metropolis?"
Bobby back, too. Everyone glad to see his innocent face. Pulled
down a bit with his long illness. Pathetically acknowledges the fact
by cutting down his collars.
"Can't carry as much sail as I used to do, Toby, dear boy," he
says, with something like tear glistening in his left eye. "Rut I'm
coming round, and will go the paoe again. Bad thing for Spkncer
me being laid up; but I'm coacbiog him again, and he '11 pull
through now, you '11 see." Business done.—Votes in Supply.

In Commons, urgent necessity for House being kept. Important

business commenced, House must listen to fresh Irish grievance. At
Twenty-five minutes past Six, Windbag Sexton interposed. At
Seven o'clock still speaking. At Half-past Seven the level How of
pointless talk going forward.
"If ever there was a man inebriated with the exuberance of his
own verbosity, this is he," said Campbell Bannerman, violently
yawning. "Had a good chance once, but he's taken to speaking as
some men take to drinking, and is a hopeless case."
"Yes," said Henry Fowler, returning the yawn; "Sexton's
arranged for interment of his own opportunities."
At Ten minutes to Eight Windbag collapsed. House in state of
physical and mental collapse. Redmond rising, the few Members
present fled, and House Counted Out at Eight o'Clock.

NOISES OF THE NIGHT.

I bousht my couch that quiet
My system might restore,
When—bless me, what a riot!
No ohanoe to slumber more I
Some fool's locked out; he '11
raoket,
And beat the door, and whack
it,
And skirmish and attack it,
Till he breaks down the door!
He's done at last! Now scatter
Thy poppy, Somnus, do.
Hullo, what is the matter?
Was that a Cock that crew?
Tt teas,—and hark the squalling,
The scurry, and miawling,
Of Cats, the oaterwauliog,
Abominable crew!
Next 'Arries without number
Come clamouring along,
Thev scatter dream and slumber
With blasphemy and song,
And scarcely do they mizzle,
When dreadful through the
drizzle,
The Railways screech and whistle.
This really is too btrong!
I had not closed a peeper,
And rest seemed wondrous
sweet,
Proserpine Gardens, Kensington, W.
When, lo, the Chimney-sweeper!
Came screamingdownthe street.
The Milkman raised a clamour,
Then Hammer, hammer, hammer!
"The Postman 'tis," I stammer.
And now they carpets beat!
Here, as I sit inditing
My "copy" for the Press,
Three bands, their brass uniting,
Invade the peaoefulness;
Five organs, and a vendor
Of faggots for the fender,
Onn preacher, a pretender,
What right has he to bless?
Ah, for some cottage lonely
The burn goes singing by,
There wakes no sound, or only
The sheep-bells, and the sigh
Of winds that stir the cover.
The plaining of the plover,
The song of larks that hover
Beneath the arch of sky I
There dog nor cat shall waken
To vex the sacred night,
Nor tunes of maids mistaken,
Nor any dynamite.
Nor soreams of boys infernal,
That cry the ev'ning journal;
Nor tbat remark eternal,
"A light, Sir-box o' light'!"

Because I had refused a seat on a drag.
Because I had made up my mind to stay in and work all day.
Because 1 invariably back the losers and draw blanks or rank

Because I've been there so often.
Because I know it all by heart.
Because I shall catch cold, or the sun will be too strong for me.
Because I hate a crowd.
Because I shan't be back in time for dinner.

But— I went after all.
A REAL PLEASURE.
(Nibbs at the Inventories on June the Fifth.)
The Conversazione given by Sir Frederick and Lady Leonora
Bramwell on Friday night last, at the Inventories, was perfection.
A lovely night, a rare and varied musical entertainment, select
company, a festival of colour, iced cups, fragrant coffee, and the
choice Savannah—such a combination made three hours pass away
like some fairy vision. The rain politely held off till a quarter past
twelve, and then it had its turn, but gently at first, giving the guests
full warning, and plenty of time to get away comfortably.
Paris and Vienna must pale their ineffectual fires before the mar-
vellous effects of electric lighting at the Inventories, and I should
say that at the present moment no Capital in Europe can offer any-
thing like such a show—such an Arabian Nights' Entertainment—as
is to be seen at the Inventories, and especially when exhibited to
such advantage as on the occasion of this Conversazione.
But what shall I say of Strauss's Band, which shared the Pro-
gramme with the others, playing from ten to twelve? What shall
1 say of Eduard Strauss, Prince of Conductors of Dance Musio, the
like of whom for energy, foraotion, and for "go" for the "lilt" whioh
he communicates to the Band, and through them to the Audience,
I have not seen since the days of Jullien,—" Mons. " Jullien, who
was the delight of the holidays of my boyhood? It seems to me a
mistake that Eduard Strauss should ever include in his Programme
such pieces as Chopin's "Marche Funebre," or an "Ave Maria,"
by Schubert. Odi profanum—but when I heard the last-mentioned
composition, I could not help momentarily expecting to see the active
Conductor suddenly throw off the self-imposed restraint, and take
the hymn in waltz, polka, or galop time. Chassez le naturel, il
reviendra au galop.
On Friday night, however, the Ave Maria was received with, if
possible, greater favour than any of the other selections. Pretty to see
the people catching the Strauss fever, and moving their heads and
then their feet in the strictest time! The performance of danoe-
mnsio by Strauss's Band is a revelation. It unvnlgarises even the
polka, and, from time to time, imparts an elevating tone to that un-
graceful and prosaic dance. In honour of the event I present the
world, on the usual terms, with a new version of Charles F.
Adams's delightful poem of Leedle Yawcob Strauss, which, of
I call
LEEDLE EDUARD STRAUSS.
They haf von very clever man
At der Inventorees,
To see hii
Dats zomtings if you
He hops und schumps und marks
der time,
Und shows such taste and nous,
Dat dere's to equal him no vun.
Mine clever Eduard Strauss!
He fills our ears mit lofely sounds,
Applause "brings down der
house,"
Dat happens to feu oder poys,
But leedle Eduard Strauss.
He dakes der viddle in his hands,
Und he sohust hlay it, too!
He dake der sohtick to beat der
time,
Mine gracious, dot vos drue.
And with this and my very strongest recommendation to every
one to go and hear Strauss's Band play danoe-music, and to clever
Eduard Strauss to stick to bis dance-music while he's here, I re-
main, the Publio's, very truly, Nibbs.
His band blays not too load nor
zoft,
It kicks not up a touse,
Oh, peutiful I der schapa are few
Like leedle Eduard Strauss.
Und ven der beeble hear dot band
Dey at each oder glance,
Den vag deir heads, den move deir

Und vish dot dey might dance.
Und ven dey blay der "Danube

Und call for it vonce more.

As guiet as a mouse,
Dere's none vor dance tones any

Like leedle Eduard Strauss.

NOTHING LIKE SNAILS!
[A correspondence has bren going on in the Standard, advocating the use
of snails for cutaneous disease.]
If you are not quite sure of the state of your skin,
There's the Standard has wonderful yarns,
But one fancies its medical readers must grin
At the lore of the Reverend Baknks.
He says if you tickle and feel very bad,
And each medical remedy fails,
Why, go to the garden where they 're to be had,
And then rub yourself over with Snails.
You first take off the shell, says this merciful gent,
Which may seem to the Snail rather hard,
And I don't think a parson would e'er be content
His own cuticle thus to discard.
Then you rub him well in till you 're thoroughly cured,
That is all the prescription entails,
But these good folks don't say what the Snails have endured
When they tow that there's nothing like Snails.
CYCLOMANIA.
Chapter 1.
"If you want exeroise," says old Spboggeb, of Summersault
House, if you want real exeroise, now, there's nothing in the world
to be compared to a tricycle."
I don't know why Spboggeb is always bothering about my
becoming what he calls a "wheelman." What interest oan he
possibly possess in attempting to induce a respectable middle-aged
citizen, like myself, to risk his existenoe in rash enterprises, such as
being a Velooipedist? "A Velooipedist" sounds like a Voltairian
sort of person. Why? See the connection. Got him mixed up with
"Enoyolopsedist." Every time I meet him he "babbles of green
fields, and how to see them on a four-and-twenty guinea "Road-
ster. Life, with Spboggeb, has beoome a oy cling affair altogether.
Perhaps it makes him happy. I suppose all jokes about Wheel and
Woe are exhausted by this time, as when I tried it, everybody went
on talking about something else. The best of all jokes if ill-timed is
the worst. Yet a number of good jokes are to be picked, up in this
way by a careful listener.
"Do you know how. many wheelmen' there are now P " he goes on
almost threateningly.
I am obliged to confess I do not. I don't want to hurt old
Sproogkk's feelings, or I should tell him at onoe that the precise
number of wandering lunatics about is quite immaterial to me.
"Three hundred thousand!" says Spboggkb, stopping to observe
the effect his announcement will have on me. As it has none what-
ever, he goes on in rather a disappointed tone: "Then all the
aristocracy are taking to it. Why, anybody who doesn't tricycle—
no," says Spboggeb, who will pensh rather than fail in his duty to
velocipedists—"no, I won't say that, but anybody who isn't a
wheelman of on* tort or another is out of it altogether nowadays, I
oan tell you."
I feel inclined to say something funny as to its being probable that
I shall be "out of it"—the tricycle, I mean—if I am ever fool
enough to get into it. But I don't say it, because a joke against his
favourite amusement outs poor Spboggeb to the heart. As I have
no desire to cut Spboggeb to the heart, I merely ask what members
of the aristocracy ride—I beg bis pardon—are " wheelmen P"
Somehow he doesn't seem quite definite as to their names. "Oh,
a whole lot of 'em," he says, in a way which / should call dis-
respectful. "You can't"—in a tone of remonstrance—"read the
papers, or von'd see about it. There's the Princess Thingumbob, of
Moldavia-Krakowitz-Spifflenburg—she's ordered a whole lot of
trioyoles for her nursery, you know. Lord What's-his-hamk—he'»
a wheelman; at least, Spboggeb goes on thoughtfully, "he was,
before he broke his collar-bone. But," he ends up cheerfully, "it's
quite the tip-top thing, I can assure you."
I tell Spboggeb that I believe him entirely, but that I am think-
ing (so I am, in my insanely extravagant moments) of purchasing a
horse—taking horse-exercise, in fact.
"A horse! says Spboggeb, in a tone of genuine pity. "Why,
my dear fellow, cycling- is far superior in every way to riding. Just
think what a hopelessly inferior machine a horse is, compared with
a " Shoreditoh Zephyr," for instance. A horse doesn't glide along in
the beautiful way that a wheel does, now does it P"
I am constrained to admit that horses don't glide. If I bought a
horse which showed any tendency to gliding, nothing should induce
me to keep him for a single day.
"Then '—8pboggeb proceeds, trying to pick all the holes he can
in horses, which is rather mean, I think, as they aren't here to defend
themselves—" a horse's shoes are always coming off, and all that sort
of thing. Besides, a trioyole doesn't want any nay, or grooming."
"Or water," I suggest.
"Or water "—Spboggeb accepts the suggestion. "And it's safer,
too; you haven't half so far to fall."
"Then you do fall sometimes"—I exclaim, triumphantly. I am
quite glad to have old Spboggeb, who is always boasting of the
perfect seourity of a trioyole, up in a oorner, at last.
"No, you don't fall off," he replies inoonsiatently and rudely. "No,
you don t. Then"—he winds up the conversation—" you will get a
trioyole, won't youP I'm so glad"—he says, taking it quite for
granted,—" I'm really so glad that you're going to get one. And
you must join our Club too, the West Kensington Dragonfly Wheel-
men, you know. Mind, you had better write to-night for a 4 Number
One Shoreditoh Zephyr,' and I '11 call round in a day or so and see
that you've got it.
41 See that you have got it," reminds me of the advertisements.
"Write for a Number One Shoreditoh Zephyr, and See that you get
it!" But suppose you don't get it, and they try to palm off on you
a 44 Number Six Whiteohapel Zephyr," or a 41 Ratcliff Highway
Gossamer" instead, what then P "T'was Zephyr thus from ohild-
hood's days "—see suggestion iorjeu de mot in this. Keep it to myself.
"I am not thinking of purchasing any sort of trioyole," I reply
to Sproggeb's last observation: 44 and why should I get a Shore-
ditch Zephyr if I did want one P
44 My dear fellow," says Spboggeb, sadly and impressively, 441
should have thought, after what I've told you about the 4 Zephyr,'
that you'd have simply caught at the idea. It's nothing to me, of
course, if you go and get a regular second-hand Bone-shaker—nothing
at all."
I don't like Spboggeb assuming this tone with me. A little more,
and I feel that our friendship—the friendship of years—will be
severed. 44 Then you do consider," I say, soothingly,—" then you
really do consider tricycling a fine pursuit, and the 4 Shoreditoh
Zephyr' a capital machine P
441 should just think I did," he answers. 44 Why, it was a
4 Shoreditoh Zephyr' that the Princess of Moldavia-Krakowitz-
Spifflenburg ordered for the Crown Prince, and she was so pleased
with it that—well, you ought just to see the flattering letter she sent
the makers!"
Really I feel that I have been grossly unjust to tricydiets in
general, and the makers of the 14 Shoreditoh Zephyr" in particular.
Spkoqgeb parts with me, hoping that I shall soon be a 44 wheel-
man," and, as a necessary consequence, "join their Club." Now
that this tricyoling tyranny of Spboggeb is overpast, why not go and
call on the Habkaways P I will. Fbed Habkaway, at all events,
isn't a 41 wheelman," or wasn't when I last saw him, a couple of
months ago. Then he's got some nice sisters, who, I am convinced,
would sooner perish than ride a velocipede.
Luokily, I find them all at home, Fbed, the Barrister, included.
Miss Fanny Habkaway startles me by asking, in her most insinu-
ate gway—
44 Why don't you buy a tricycle? We've got suoh a beauty—
it's a 4 Corrugated Convertible, you know; and we see such a lot of
lovely country; and you really must get one yourself I"
44 But I see all the same country by train," I reply, gasping.
44 And a train is—well, it's more comfortable, isn't it, than a
tricycle P"
Trains! I am at once surrounded and howled at by a band of
male and female cyclists whose ferooity puts old Spboggeb quite in
the shade. (By the bye, can you call a female cyolist a "wheel-
woman"? Shall ask Fbed Habkaway about this presently in
private.) I find, to my intense surprise, that Fbed nimself has
taken to the pastime. If I had only known this, I shouldn't have
dreamed of calling on the Habkaways.
44 Then," says Fbed Habkaway, with adroit flattery, 44 you 're
just the shape for it."
Really, tricycling seems to have its good points! I have never
been told before—that is, for the last twenty years—that my shape
was an athletio advantage. Think of the line about 44 shape which
shape had none," but don't say it, as it doesn't pay to run oneself
down too much. Yes, I think I will start a trioyole.

A SEASONABLE INVENTION.
Messes. Daubiton, Tintem & Co. beg to inform the Public that
they are about to introduce into the Fashionable Market, and they
trust into the Home of Taste and the Boudoir of Beauty, a new and
most elegant Complexion Improver, whioh they are convinced will
speedily supersede Rouge, Rose Pink, Auroral Flush, Bendemeer
Balm, Compost of Cashmere, and all other compositions ever devised
foT the purpose of incarnadining the human cheek divine, to be called
"The British Matron's Burning Blush."
This choice and elegant preparation is designed to meet a Great
Public Want whioh has long been felt, more especially in the Art-
loving World. There is, indeed, so much in Modern Sooiety at which
it is the obvious duty of True Modesty to Blush, that a permanent
Blush has become a desideratum. Nature cannot be depended upon
to furnish the due measure of sanguineous determination on all occa-
sions and at short notice. What can be more distressing to True
Modesty than not to blush brilliantly on the right occasion and at
the psychological moment f Cases have been known in whioh well-
bred young girls, and even watchful and susceptible British Matrons,
have failed to blush when, according to social usage, they should
have done so, or have been, as it were, behind-hand with their blush,
not beginning the necessary performance until more observant and
sensitive persons have ended it. The power of promptly perceiving
the Immodest is indeed unequally distributed, and in many oases
requires subtle and assiduous training.

"But I will look before I leap!"
He vowed, and struggled with the slate,
In decimals and fractions deep
He vainly tried to calculate.
Alas for Love, for ever dumb,
Alas for Hope, whose lamp grew dim,
The c jils of that prodigious sum
Increased, embraced, and strangled him 1
Of over-pressure did he die.—
Compound addition sealed his doom;
And now six hundred Matrons sigh,
And scatter roses on his tomb!

When Messrs. Daubiton and Tintem speak of the Immodest, they
of course refer to what is, by unerring social convention, recognised
as such. No merely natural instinct, however refined and delicate,
will, of course, suffice to determine this. On this subject the British
Matron is the acknowledged and final authority. To blush when
Society does not demand it—as in a modern Ball-room, or at a
fashionable Theatre—is of course as ridiculous, as essentially "bad
form," as not to blush when Society does require it—as at a British
[not Foreign) Art Exhibition, or Sculpture Gallery.
Messrs. Daubiton and Tintem trust that the difficulties arising
from this state of affairs will be entirely removed by the introduction
of their "British Matron's Burning Blush." Armed with this
choice preparation, the most susceptible will be ready for all sooial
emergencies. In the Art Season more particularly, it will prove an
invaluable companion for all Ladies, whether Maids or Matrons, who
have to perform the fashionable duty of going the rounds of the
Galleries. They will then be able even to go through the trying
ordeal of " gazing on divinity disrobed " without being suspected of
insensibility to the impropriety and immodesty of the exhibition.
Messrs. D. and T. anticipate that this artificial Blush will entirely
supersede the ordinary process of nature, whioh cannot be in all
cases safely depended on, and which will henceforth doubtless sink
into absolute disuse, at any rate in Fashionable Sooiety.—[Adtt.]
Mrs. Ramsbotham says of the proposed New Duties that "It's
all vanity and taxation of spirits."
THE CAUTIOUS KURD.
He saw, he loved them, he was fired
By Passion, like a furnace blown.
Without exception he desired
To call each one of them his own.

The number of these ladies was
A trifle over thirty score,
A figure limited, because
The Pasha could afford no more.
(Lands of the Vulture and the Dove
Our chill morality disclaim.
In Fakga's heart the flame of love
Was really something like a flame!)
Below their windows Faega sighed—
Six hundred windows, more or less—
But, as their glittering veils he spied,
He thought about the cost of dress.
Then did he pause, and contemplate.
Then felt his flame the douche of doubt,
And finally he got a slate
To cipher all the matter out.
"The Housekeeping for each fair head
Let's call," he wrote, "two pounds a
week;
The man that can afford to wed,
Must be a Pasha or a Greek!
"Twelve hundred pounds by fifty-two?
And then the children, nurses, masters,—
There does not breathe a Kurd can do
So vast a sum into piastres!

indeterminate sketcbiness. They require a deal of ex-
planation, too, like the works of that other enigmatic
genius. Looked at in the right way, and from precisely
the proper point of view, they may possibly be seen to
mean something or other, but the general effect to the
ordinary gazer is as negative and nubibustic as that of
any Whistlerian Nocturne. His last "Arrangement"

in fact, a piece which passes all ordinary understanding.

EXTRA-JUDICIAL OATHS.
Entertained the other evening by the Lord Mayor at the
Mansion House, Her Majesty's Judges had a considerable eulogy
pronounced upon them by his Excellency the United States Minister,
concluding, as reported, thus : —
"An American Judge once remarked that two courses were open to a dis-
appointed suitor in the United States. He might either appeal the case or go
away and swear at the Court. {Laughter.) I do not think this second
course is very much in vogue in this country. (Cheert.)"
Perhaps it isn't. Swearing, in this country, is not at all in vogue,
except among classes comprising but few litigants. Disappointed,
suitors, in the present day, do not usually go away and swear at the
Court aloud. It may, however, be feared that the language they
would use if they expressed their feelings audibly would sometimes
prove rather strong. They seldom take this second course mentioned
by the American Minister. But they do very often resort to the first,
and not only " appeal the case," but go on appealing it through Court
upon Court, each Court above in turn reversing the decision of the
Court below. If disappointed litigants were accustomed to swear at
Court after Court upon each successive disappointment, and all the
profane oaths thus sworn could be recorded, registered, and the
swearers every one of them for every oath fined five shillings, what

whom we owe the immortal Bohemian Girl. To have left such a

NEUTRAL GROUND. THE SERGE ANT-AT-ARMS "AT HOME
OLD SCORES;
Or, Paying Them Of Made Easy.
It is understood that, with a view to cutting down the ridiculously
high scores and counteracting the rapidly-growing' superiority of the
Bat, a superiority that is fast tending to render a Cricket Match
quite an interminable affair, the Committee of the M.C.C. have
decided on adopting, without further delay, the following brief
Schedule of Rules, which, it is hoped, will do something towards
restoring the old equilibrium to the game, and giving the Bowler
something of his old chance.
The Ball.
The Ball shall, in future, weigh one pound thirteen ounces and a
half, be nineteen inches in diameter, and tinted a bright grass green,
selected to match as nearly as possible the colour of the bowling
crease.
The Bat.
The face of the Bat shall lose two inches in width, five in length,
while the handle shall be shortened by a foot or even more, on appeal
to the Umpire, if the Out side so desire it.
The "Wicket.
The Wicket shall consist of five stumps, rising to a height of six
feet three inches, and presenting a breadth of not more than two feet
two inches. To give the Batsman an equivalent advantage, and
enable him to cover this conveniently, he will be permitted either to
stand on a chair or play his innings on stilts.
The Geouitd.
The ground between the two wickets shall be carefully prepared
underneath the turf with patent elastio India-rubber pavement,
which will have the effect of making the Ball rise freely and unex-
pectedly, and so give the Bowler some slight advantage against an
active Batsman. To prevent runs coming too fast, the Umpires
shall, if requested by the Out Captain, after every third_ Over
convert the portion of the ground between the two Wickets into a
butter-slide,'.and request the Batsmen to remove their spikes.
The Field.
The Field shall be disposed as usual, but being provided with
large seven-foot expanding web-handed net Gloves and pantomime
heads, and being well padded with the new cricketing air-cushion
suit, they can stand in olose and, surrounding the Batsman, render
a drive for six, or even for one, a practical impossibility. _ An
innings of double figures, with decent fielding on this principle,
will be found therefore to be a rare occurrence.
N.B.—More stringent regulations, on the above lines, are already
under consideration, but it mav be stated that a competent authority
has given it as his opinion that if the foregoing Rules are strictly
adhered to, as it is proposed they should be, at the forthcoming
Oxford and Cambridge Match at Lord's, the contest will be over in
less than five-and-twenty minutes. The advantage of this will b«
obvious, and all the lovers of Cricket must feel that at last a move
has been made in the right direction.

THE DOOMED ASSOCIATE.
A Romance of Modern AH,
«•••••
The thermometer still Btood at 88°, and the gloomy stupor that
had for some time been irresistibly settling on the assembled Acade-
micians, seemed now to deepen visibly with the fast fading daylight.
A faint and weary dreaminess oppressed the President. He had
been recalling some of his own after-dinner speeches. Still he
struggled to overoome their influence, and complete, by one supreme
effort, the matter of business that had, notwithstanding the fierce
tropical temperature of the evening, occasioned the conclave of his
colleagues, whose labours it was not only his highest duty, bat his
honest endeavour to stimulate and direct. He rose to his feet.
There was a momentary hush. The conversation had for several
hours been turning on the recent outrages perpetrated with a large
kitchen toasting-fork on all the noted pictures of the year. Many
had been torn to shreds. Some, more fortunate, were hanging from
their frames in slices. All had suffered remarkably, and public
interest was excited. Among the Academicians themselves there
was but one feeling on the subject. Thev had sold their Pictures,
and regarded the matter with sulky indifference. But the evening
was hot, and they were human. They could not but snarl over the
circumstance in suppressed whispers.
"Come, Gentlemen," said the President, looking round npon them
in his most finished manner with a feeble smile, "waste no more
thought about the jealous miscreant. We neither know, nor care to
know, his name. Let us proceed to business. We have one more
eleotion to make, and then our labours end."
"The sooner the better," gasped an old Gentleman, pushing his
way to a place at the table opposite his Chief; "but don't say we
don't know names."
He seized a pencil as he spoke, and wrote two words on a small
piece of inked piper. He folded it np, and tosstd it to the President.
■' There," he said, " we know names well enough, hut we don't always
mention them, lest the matter gets wind, and the parties escape. I
have had six Detectives on him for a month," he continued with a
chuckle, "and to-morrow morning, as sure as my name is John
Herbert, we nab him." The veteran Academician resumed his
seat with a call to order. Nobody heeded his excitement. "It's
only old Herbert," they said.
The President opened the paper and read it, smiling again in his
best manner. Then he refolded it, and took it up to place it in his
waistcoat pocket. He did not notice that he let it fall upon the table.
The evening had now grown inconveniently dark; the sky-effects
were pronounced by the majority to be worthy of an outsider, and
they determined to proceed with their bu«iness without candles.
The method of election of an Associate of the Royal Academy,
though extremely simple, strikes the uninitiated as strange, if not
even quaint. The President's hat, a new one, is generally selected
for the purpose, and is placed upon a chair in the middle of the
room. Into it each Academician in turn casts the names of not less
than five-and-twenty friends, acquaintances, or, if possible, relations,
whom he considers eligible for the honour. These names are written
on little slips of folded paper.
The President's new hat being now filled by these to the very
brim, the process of "eleotion commenoes. This is oontrived
adroitly as follows. Held firmly by the Treasurer, on one side, and
on the other by the junior Trustee, the hat is carried several times
quickly round the room, while each Academioian present, taking a
run at it, gives, when he gets a chance, a smart kick at the crown,
thereby effectively disturbing some of the contents, and scattering
them on the ground. At first the scraps of paper are easily dis-
placed by a light touch; but, as the hat gets gradually emptied of
its contents, the kicks take necessarily a more lively character, till,
when the last few remaining names are reached, the horse-play
becomes both fast and furious, the whole culminating in the crown
coming bodily out, together with the final paper. This, with the
iebrit of his hat, is eagerly seized by the now panting President,
who, opening the paper and reading the name, good-numouredly
announces to the palpita<in

These time-honoured details had, notwithstanding the exoessive
heat and the twilight, been strictly adhered to on the present occa-
sion, and the President, having secured the final paper, and opened
it, there was a general cry for lights.
"Well?" was the general Bhout, as the walking stick and
umbrella keeper entered with candles, " well ?— who is the unlucky
dog? His name? What's his name? Out with it!'
The President had turned a rich Chinese white. His hand
trembled like a stippling brush, and for a moment the room swam
before him. He was gazing at a little bit of ink-stained
Then he rallied. "The name of our new Associate,
said, in a firm voioe, "is Btjrne Jones!"
There was a wild yell of astonishment. But at that moment the
aged Academician had darted towards the President.
"That man!" he cried, with a low wail of agony—"there's
some mistake! Why he's the fellow who"
"Hush!" said the President, rapidly drawing him aside.

"STUFF 0' THE CONSCIENCE."
A morning Contemporary attributes to the Under-Seoretary for
the Colonies an observation which may be reiiarded as rather excep-
tional; the speeches of Mr. Evelyn Ashley beinir, in point of
common sense, usually quite worthy of his father's son. Addressing
a conference of Liberals lately held at Shanklin, the Hon. Gentleman,
if not misquoted, "while expre-sing his belief in ihe eftu-a.-v of
Vaccination, said he was in favour of the abolition of the compulsory
priuciple when a parent has proved his objections to be conscien-
tious. Mr. Ashley doubtless believes not only in the efficacy of
Vaocination, but also in that of scientific medical treatment in
general. Suppose one of the Peouliar People had not only refuted to
let his child be vaccinated, but also, the child having been seized
with smallpox, persisted in refusing to send for a Doctor, would the
representative of the intelligent electors of the Isle of Wight have
the compulsory principle abolished for that parent solely because he
had proved his objections to be conscientious?

THE ARTFUL "AJAX."
A Nautical Song of the Period.
"The Ajax has a supreme contempt for her helm. She does
just as she pleases, and oan only be kept under the semblanoe of
control by the adoption on board of the moat heroic remedies."
Admiralty and Sorte-Guarde' Gautte.
An artful ship is the Ajax bold,
With a yo-heave-ho!
She's found uncommonly hard to hold,
With a yo-heave-ho 1
She waltzes about in all the seas,
And she rolls although there isn't a breeze,
A sort of naval " Go-as-you-please,"
With a yo-heave-ho!
No waves are present to overwhelm,
With a yo-heave-ho!
But still she doesn't obey her helm,
With a yo-heave-ho!
When tired of carrying helm a-port,
She's off to starboard in playful sport,
A monstrous maritime "rorty sort,"
With a yo-heave-ho!
She anohored safe anear Dover town,
With a yo-heave-ho!
But steam was up, though the anchor down,
With a yo-heave-ho I
And luckv, too, for she broke away,
And smashed all her cable there, they say;
Her Captain must have had a lively day,
With a yo-heave-ho 1
And now she's off, this lively gal,
With a yo-heave-ho 1
A-cruising with Hornby, Admiral,
With a yo-heave-ho!
Though Captain Rbnnedy furl and reef,
And keep up steam, it's my firm belief,
The artful Ajax will come to grief,
With a yo-heave-ho!
A Reasonable Sebvtcb.—Mr. Booth, Generalissimo
of the S. A., has announced, on the part of its organisers,
that they are proposing also to start a "Salvation
Navy." Good, it the shipping of the S. A. is to consist
of Life Boats.
The Liberals say that the Government has been
"Wrecked in Port." Stranded on a Beach would,
perhaps, be nearer the mark.
THE REVOLUTION ON EVOLUTION.
(By a Bewildered Philistine.)
Barbing earthquake, or the submersion of this Island, or the
devastation of London and its suburbs by Chinese or some other
barbaric or semi-barbario invaders, the statue of Chables Dabwin
will look down for all time on the visitors to the Natural History
Museum at South Kensington. It is not astonishing that the Arch-
bishop of Canterbury, the Dean of Wbstminsteb, and Archdeacon
Fabbab, assisted at the unveiling of that monument by Professor
Huxley. The residue of the propounder of Evolution had previously.
nem. diss, of the Clergy, if not also of the Dissenters, been interred
in Westminster Abbey. Public instructors have taken occasion to
moralise joyfully on the wonderful change of attitude towards the
dootrine of Dabwin displayed by their Reverences and their
Worships from that which their predecessors, and perhaps some of
themselves, exhibited six-and-twenty years ago.
The moralists on that transition from anathema to admiration,
enthusiastically proclaim that it is all right. They are apparently
convinced that Evolution is a grand discovery and an unquestionable
truth, although Dabwin himself seems to have not been quite cock-
sure of it, and to have proposed it as not much more than a highly
probable theory. Be that as it mar, on what supposition is the
entire reversal of their Worships' and Reverenoes' judgment of it to
be explained? When first it was announced to them they either
misunderstood Evolution, or else entertained erroneous ideas of the
verities to whioh they imagined it contrary—the orthodoxy they
professed to teach. They must now acknowledge Dabwin's doxy;
do they, therefore, peroeive that it agrees with their own doxy, or
seem to have seen reason to modify the latter P At any rate, they
may be presumed to have become satisfied that Evolution, if a faot,
by no means destroys their own professional raison d'etre. By what
considerations Public Instructors, judiciously or injudiciously, forbear
(if able) to enlighten the public mind.
PROVIDENCE FOR THE POOR.
Dr. Alfred Cabpentbb, writing to the Times on the subject of
"Disfranchisement for Receipt of Medical Relief," says:—
"If the prinoiple of Provident Dispensaries among the poor were properly
inculcated, so that by means of a small payment per week or It. a month, a
family should be able to obtain medical advice when required, there would be
no occasion at any time to call upon the parish for assistance, unless some-
thing else should be wanted."
Now this merits consideration. Dr. Cabpenteb thinks the action
ot the House of Lords in the matter is to be commended. Mr.
Punch, as he has already intimated, does not. But if it should have
the effect of calling public attention to the Provident Dispensary
system, there will be something at least to be said for it. Several
gentlemen, notably Dr. John Maunbell, late of Bath, have
endeavoured, with little success hitherto, to get this important
subjeot properly ventilated, both in its hearings upon the interest of
the poor and of the Medical Profession. Dr. Maunbell, in particular,
has made a special study of it for years, and has worked hard to
direct attention to the vices and mischiefs of the present practice,
and the beneficent possibilities of the Provident Dispensary System
Sroperly understood and applied. Mr. Punch gladly seconds Dr.
absentee's appeal to our Lady Bountifuls, benevolence organisers,
aye, and practical politicians and unsentimental philanthropists of all
classes, to take this matter into immediate and earnest consideration.

Mb. Cyril Flower was not a defaulter on the night of the
Government defeat. He wrote to the Times to say that he came up
to Town all the way from the Island of Lewis. When, in future, any
loyal Liberal humes to Westminster post-haste to assist his party,
it will be said of him that he " Cometh up as a Flower." N.B.—This

UNIMPEACHABLE.
The recent crisis has naturally given rise to a great many rumours,
for the perfect authenticity of which it has not always been possible
to vouch. The following, however, which have been carefully sifted,
may be taken quite confidently cum grano.
It is stated on good authority that Lord Salisbury, for the purpose
of insuring himself a working majority in the House of Commons,
has stipulated that Mr. Gladstone's recent phalanx of " Abstainers"
shall be all provided, from the Secret Service Fund, with sufficient
means to enable them to pass the remainder of the Session at some of
the cheaper watering-places, while the Irish party will have the
option either of going up in a batch to the Upper House, or being
permanently " named" by the Speaker.
It is now no longer a secret that Lord Randolph Churchill has
carried his point, and that his objection to accepting off-hand the
Leadership of the House of Commons has been overcome. Sir Stafford
Northcote becomes Viceroy of India, and has consented to start
to-morrow via Flushing.
It is understood that the Premier's refusal to go down to Balmoral
and personally tender his resignation to Her Majesty hinged at the
last moment on a simple question of the payment of his railway fare.
Considering that, due to the pressing circumstances under which his
journey was about to be undertaken, he had a right to a third olass
return ticket free of cost, and this being obstinately denied him by
the Authorities at Euston Square, he, with some show of irritation,
entrusted his mission, just as the train was starting, to an active
Queen's Messenger, who happened to be lounging about the plat-
form. Notwithstanding the protest of the Officials, this gentleman
who, it appears, had grown familiar with the feat from successfully
attempting it on nearly all the great Continental lines, adroitly
swung himself under the guard's van and holding firmly to the axle
bar, travelled thus suspended without a break as far as Perth.

for him at the latter plaoe, it was entirely owing to his prompt and
energetic action that the Queen's reply was received in London on
the morning of the following Wednesday week.
Lord Richabd Gbostenob's celebrated " Four-Line " "Whip Letter
of Explanation is now admitted on all hands to have been a clever
and ingenious hoax. Conoeived and carried out jointly by a sporting
Baronet, well known on the Front Opposition Benches, and a sub-
ordinate Official of the House, celebrated for his strong language,
olever caligraphy, and keen sense of humour, it had, as might have
been foreseen, the desired effect of keeping the bulk of the party well
at a distance.
One of the first acts of the New Ministry it is reported, on good
authority, will be to dispatch Mr. Ashmead-Babtlett, with as little
delay as possible, on a Special Secret Mission to the Russian Camp
at Zullikar. With a view to enabling him thoroughly to master the
intricaoies of the complicated situation in a manner satisfactory to
the Government, he will be provided, before starting, with all the Blue
Books bearing on the subject, a copy of the " Lives of the Czars :"
and, to disarm suspicion, he will be unaccompanied by an Interpreter.
With full powers to meet General Komaboff boldly on his own
ground, and ask him as many questions, without notice, as he can, it
is confidently believed that, as Mr. Ashmead-Babtlett will have,
moreover, unlimited leave of absence, his seleotion for this delicate
Mission will, while graoefully acknowledging his special services
in the past, at the same time prove a very substantial benefit to his
Sarty generally. His departure for Central Asia under these con-
itions cannot but be watched with lively interest.
Signs of the Times.
Mb. Maple, Upholsterer, runs a horse for the Derby, a real live
one, not a towel-horse, with a good chance of winning when he
turned Tottenham Court no, we mean Tattenham Corner. Then
Mr. Walter Seoolbbed buys a deer-forest in Argyllshire, and
considers it a cheap forest. If Messrs. Swan and Edgab, or Lewis
and Allenby, take to starting a horse for the great race of the year,
they not only might win the " Blue Riband of the Turf," but, as a
little bit of economy, and all in the way of business, supply it them-
selves.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, June 8.—Seats Bills went
through Lords to-night after decent show of debate. The Markiss
in most conciliatory mood. Wouldn't even listen to proposals for
Amendment. Most of the old friends oame up again. Onoe more
the fight raged round Batley and Morley; and the great question
that shook the House of Commons to its centre, whether it should be
Radcliffe-cum-Farnworth, or Farnworth-oum-Radcliffe, earnestly
debated. Powebscoubt wanted one of the Dublin Divisions called
Donny brook to be re-named St. Stephen's.
"Never mind," said the Markiss, "muoh the same thing. Been
in the .Commons myself, you know."
Meanwhile, Commons spent a dull evening in debate on Budget.
Childebs having high old time. Of course made prodigious speech
on introducing Budget. Statement on Friday touching proposed
alterations. Long speech to-night on Motion to go into Committee,
and six hours later up again with another fearsome oration.
"No Budget can survive this," said the Sage of Queen Anne's
Gate.
"Oh, yes, you '11 pull through," said Pcleston; and so said
everyone. Whole business regarded as a bore. No Vote of Censure
for nearly a fortnight. Hicks-Beach accordingly put down one on
Budget. Great field-night proclaimed. Members, whipped up, oame
down grumbling. Government sure of majority, and what s the
use? House empty for hours during night. Filled up again towards
idnight, when Division looked for.
An Hon. Member immediately behind Treasury Bench, the only
...an in House who had listened throughout, fell asleep at 11'30. At
11*45 attack of nightmare. Began pummelling Dodds in manner
unaccountable to that gentleman. Profound sensation in House.
Thought the reckless man was in a fit. Dr. Lyons solemnly rose
and proceeded to patient, who was still pummelling Dodds. Member
behind with great presence of mind sought to relieve patient by
taking his hat off. Preparations made for loosening his shirt-collar.
But this too muoh. Had listened all through to Childebs' speech
No. 1, Hicks-Beach, Geobse Ham i lion, the long list of dinner-hour
orators, Childebs's speech No. 2, and Stafford Nobthcote. But
was not going to lose his hat. Awoke; made wild dash at Member
behind; recovered his hat, and tried to look as if nothing had
happened. Pretty to see Dodds insisting on shaking hands with him.
Awakened Member resented this as inconsequential. Hadn't

slightest idea how severely he'd pummelled Member for Stookton,
who desired to intimate that no harm was done.
Tuesday, 1'30 a.m.—Scene suddenly changed. Gladstone just
down after delivering fiery speeoh. "A matter of life and death
to us," he oried, with accusatory gesture towards Sir Stafford
Nobthcote, who had got his hands up his sleeves, and was trying
desperately so to dispose of the rest of his corporeal presence.
"Turn us out on our Budget and bring in your own."
But nobody thought of turning out. Government sure of majority.
Might be small, but that nothing new. Members trooped out to
Division, and straggled back again. At Quarter to Two, it was plain
that forces were equally divided. Still Government bound to win.
Kensington "telling" Ministerial numbers, in first. Even that
didn't shake universal opinion.
"These Liberals," growled Hicks, audibly smacking his lips,
"can't go through Lobby like ordinary gentlemen; rush through
like schoolboys."
Evidently mistake somewhere. Clerk hands paper to Rowland
Wlnjt, Tory Whip.
At this indication
of Government de-
feat, Randolph
leaped on the bench
and waved his hat,
shouting as only
one other man in
House can shout.
Other man there
too. Tim Healy,
on lower end of
back Bench, leaped
up and answered
the shout of tri-
umph. Shrill voice
of Joseph Gill is
rose above uproar.

cast its radiance
over his expressive
countenance.

right across the

passed down after announcing figures, Randolph publicly shook
hands with him.

Tuetday'Night.—Second
Aot in exciting Drama.
A full House, and eager
expectation. Gladstone
entering at Twenty-five
Minutes past Four, re-
ceived tremendous ovation.
If he'd been the victor instead of the vanquished, couldn't have
been greater enthusiasm amongst his followers. Conservatives, a
little taken aback by this demonstration, looked coldly on. Presently
Hicks-Beach came in. and they took their turn to cheer. Joseph
Gnxis, entering stiU later, there was a movement among the Par-
nellites. Thought they were going to cheer him. But the impulse
was resisted, and Joez B. took his seat unconscious of the flutter he
had created.
Everything seemed topsy-turvy. Gladstone oheered just after
being routed, and never during five years of Ministry were there
such jubilant faces on Treasury Benoh. Habtinqton positively
smiling. Harcoukt breaking out from time to time in a low chuckle,
Dilke and Chamberlain chatting and laughing as if they had
private information of good joke.
Only Gladstone solemn and dignified. Rose before questions put,
and stated that in consequence of the decision arrived at by House
the same morning the Cabinet had forwarded " a dutiful communi-
cation to Her Majesty." Wild horses would not drag from Glad-
stone the nature of that communication. The time might come
when he would be at liberty to disclose it. It was not yet. House
nevertheless oheered and counter-cheered as if it knew all about it.
Cheerfully acceded to motion for adjournment, and Members gaily
went off to enjoy their unexpected holiday.
Business dune.—Gladstone darkly hints at Resignation.
Friday Night.—Third and concluding Aot. Gladstone makes
clean breast of it. Unreservedly admits that the " dutiful commu-
nication" to the Queen contained his Resignation. House surprised
beyond measure. Apparently the very last thing it thought of.
What was more, the Queen had accepted the resignation, and sent
for Lord Salisbury.
"It appears to me," said Gibson, "that there was resignation on
both sides. Queen seems to have concealed with great success her
regret at William's approaching departure."

Taking Counsel.
Drove home with Gladstone after adjournment. Had a very
nattering reception from the crowd. Really didn't think I was so
widely known. Took opportunity of giving a little friendly advice
to Gladstone. Besought him to make the most of his opportunities,
avoid all work, and take long rest.
"You're quite right," he Baid, pressing my paw, "and I shall
take your advice. Shan't do much more this Session. Will save
myself up for another Midlothian Campaign and a new Parliament.
Business done.—Gladstone openly announces Resignation.
The Wreck of the "Grosvenor."
Alas for the loss of the Government Ship,
For want of " all hands to the sails!"
If the crew can't be ruled by a sharp " Four-Line Whip,
They merit a Cat-o' -nine- tails.
Change of Name in the Artistic World.—Since his being
elected Associate of the Royal Academy, " Bubne-Jones, A." will
now be known in Burlington House as "Hang-Jones, A." Now,
we know exactly where " the line" is drawn on the Academy walls.
It is drawn at Hang-Jones."
The Dat Afteb.—" How are you this morning P" asked Her-
bert Gladstone

dear boy,
but, to tell you the truth, my brow is aching; for I had too muoh
Beer and Spirits last night, and I'm completely upset." Then they

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
looked in at my Chambers a
few days after an important
sporting event, to attend to
a matter of professional
business (I had put into
"The Staircase Sweep," and
was not aware whether 1 had
drawn a placed horse), and
was met by my excellent
and' admirable Clerk in a
condition of some excite-
ment. From his bright face
I expected that I had been
sufficiently lucky to select
the Winner, and that he was
waiting to tell me the news,
and to claim the half-crown
in the guinea which I allow as a fee to my trusty retainer.
"So Snuffbox, I see, teas my selection, Portington ?" I observed,
with a smile.
My exoellent and admirable Clerk seemed for a moment surprised,
and then explained that the joy which I had noticed on his face was
not attributable to my Buooess on the Turf (as a matter of record I
niay say that I had drawn Pauper, a non-starter), bnt to the fact
that a Client was waiting for me.
"Mr. Lincoln Gray f" I exclaimed, reading the card that Por-
tisoton handed to me. "Dear me! what can he want with me?"
"He had a brief in bis hand, Sir," replied my worthy assistant,
opening the door of my room, and ushering me in.
"You do not recollect me?" said my visitor, a gentleman of staid
appearance, albeit there was a twinkle in one of his eyes which
somehow or other recalled to my recollection happier scenes than
those usually witnessed in the dark stern chambers of the law.
"No," I faltered: "although your face is very familiar to me."
"Don't you recollect Dashover's drag, and the drive home P" he
continued, with some slight hesitation. Then he laughed.
In a moment it all came back to me. I remembered that the last
occasion on which I had seen my Client, was when we were both
returning from the Races (where I had gone unknown to my wife,
but with the pure and noble objeot of " increasing my connection "),
and when we both had, for some reason or other, been induced (I was
led into the demonstration sorely against my will) to decorate our
hats with small Dutch dolls, which I subsequently handed over to my
children as a " present for good boys," from the Lowther Arcade.
"I suppose you don't remember," he said, still smiling, "that I
put you on a brief to nothing on Snuffbox t"
I replied that I had some recollection of the fact, but did not
remember (without consultation with Portington) the particular
case.
'To be sure," continued Mr. Lincoln Ghat; "and you tried to
write it down in your note-book with a latch-key."
Not wishing to contradict my Client, I bowed, and said that I had
no doubt he had accurately described the transaction.
"Well, here it is. I am never a defaulter. Snuffbox won, and
here's your brief. You will have a Leader. It is a running-down
case, and you can't go wrong."
With this (and a little further conversation of a general character)
my visitor, who still seemed to be greatly tickled at his recollection
of our return from the Races, took his leave.
On examining the papers which he had left behind him, I found
that there appeared to be no great difficulty in the matter, which
was one rather of fact than of law. The Defendant (for whom I
appeared), a Fly-proprietor, had damaged, through the alleged negli-
gence of one of his drivers, a coster monger's barrow, and the Plaintiff
(the Costermonger) sued him for compensation. The brief was
indorsed—
"With you, Mr. Hurricane, Q.C"
In due time I had a consultation with this Gentleman. I found
that in Chambers he was as meek as a lamb—a demeanour in strong
contrast with the lion-like ferocity he usually adopted when he got
into Court. He courteously questioned the Solicitor upon several
points, and then, turning to me, said, "he thonght we ought to win
the case." I agreed with much cordiality, and glanced at Mr. Lin-
coln Grat with an expression intended to convey to that gentle-
man's mind that I—" with me Mr. Hurricane, Q.C."—represented
the Learned and the Invincible.
The day of trial came. Mr. Hurricane, Q.C, cross-examined
the witnesses for the Plaintiff with a savage earnestness that whitened
the face of a corroborative crossing-sweeper with terror, and nearly
reduced a testifying police-constable to a state of hopeless hysterics.
I was delighted at his system, as I noticed that it was evidently
having its effect upon the Jury, whose sympathy seemed to be veering
round from the Costermonger to the Fly-proprietor. The interval
for lunch came just as our opponent informed us that he had no
further witnesses to call, and that "this was his case."
When I resumed my seat, on my return to the Court, after
partaking of a sandwich and a glass of ginger-beer, I found
Mr. Hurricane was absent. I was rather annoyed at this, as I
wanted to give him a hint or two about how I (were I in his place)
should lay before the Jury the case for the Defendant, which
was the next proceeding that would come before the Bench. The
opposing (i.C. and his Junior, wiping their mouths with their
handkerchiefs, return* d, chatting and laughing, to their places. The
respective Solicitors also came in. Lastly, the Judge made his
appearance, and bowed to the Bar—but not to Mr. Hurricane, Q.C. 1
Then it suddenly broke in upon me that a fearful calamity had
occurred to me I Oh, horror! My Leader was absent!
For a moment I was so completely overcome, that I could not
realise the terrors of the situation. I fancied I must be the viotim
of some horrible nightmare, and pinched my arm to wake myself up.
But no, it was too true—too real f A friend beside me whispered to
me " to go in and win;" and Mr. Lincoln Gray stooped over and
said something about Mr. Hurricane having been called away, and
that I must supply his place. At that moment how I wished that
the.Usher of the Court would change into a good Fairy, and with
his wand instantly transport me to some agreeable land thousands of
miles distant from the Royal Courts!
The Judge looked at me, and bowed. I got, or rather staggered, to
my feet, and tried to speak. My voice, when it came to me, seemed
to belong to some one else, and to be entirely beyond my control. It
was husky, and uncertain. Now it spoke in a guttural whisper, now
in a shrill howl. I began, "My Lord," and then completely forgot
the presence of the Jury. I clutched desperately at my Brief, and
suddenly, as if by inspiration, I made up my mind to read what my
Client had set down for me. This gave me confidence. I had not
made me weep like a child, took another form. I became (I felt it)
obtrusively, offensively, at my ease. As a rule, I fancy I am
accepted as extremely courteous, but on this occasion my tone (so
it seemed to me, looking at it, as I did, as a dispassionate outsider)
was so irritating, that even then it was a mystery to me that
the Judge did not immediately order me to quit the Court for
unprovoked and intolerable insolence. If he had, I should have
sorrowfully acquiesced in his decision. I felt I was coarse, nay,
brutal in my involuntary and uncontrollable arrogance. Soon I was
happy to find that I was returning to my sober self. The extremes
of fear and defiance faded away, and, to my infinite delight, I dis-
covered that I was speaking with sense and fluency.
By degrees I got into the full swing of the argument. I examined
the case from every point of view. I pointed out how weak the
evidence of the Plaintiff was, how strong was the case for the defence.
I became perfectly eloquent, and felt that I had never done full
justice to myself before. I became conscious of the presence of the
Jury, and, with winning grace, explained away all the difficulties
that might possibly puzzle them.
At length, after a really grand peroration. I finished with iust a
touch of meek, but I trust becoming, humility, "that I could not
sufficiently regret, on behalf of my client, the absence of my learned
Leader, but that I hoped I had not altogether failed in some way—
imperfeotly it might De, but still in some way, to supply his place."
With this, and a little bow to Judge and Jury, I resumed my seat,
feeling, with a glow of honest delight, that I had done my duty as
well as made my mark-
Immediately five of the Jury sprang to their feet, and insisted upon
addressing the Court.
"We want to stop this oase, my Lord," cried one of them.
I was greatly gratified, and beamed through my speotaoles at the
intelligent Jurymen.
"I am afraid you cannot do that," replied his Lordship, with a
smile. "You mutt hear the evidence for the defence. I do not
think"
"You don't understand us, my Lord," continued the Juryman
who had just spoken. Then he looked at me, and pointed at me.
We have heard all that Gentleman has been saying to us."
Here he paused, and, still smiling, I bowed to him in grateful
acknowledgment of his attention, and the evident impression my
poor eloquence had made upon the Jury in general and himself in
particular.

It appears from a recent telegram from Constantinople, that the
Sultan has at last appointed a Minister of Musio, "with whom," so
the encouraging despatch continues, "His Majesty, who is an excel-
lent performer on the pianoforte, is in the habit of frequently playing
long and difficult duetts." This promises well for the next European
Concert, where, should the programme, as it often does, break down,
the august ana accomplished ruler of Stamboul might possibly be
equal to a solo by himself. His Majesty's thorough acquaintance
with his own promissory notes no less than his familiarity with the
most brilliant financial suspensions, ought to make such a perform-
ance a very pleasing and entertaining affair; and if he oould only be
persuaded to give one of his own celebrated compositions, ai>d secure
at the same time the patronage of his creditors, the Concert might
really pass off with some iclat. At least, the idea is worth a trial.

PROPOSED NEW ROOM AT THE R.A. THE HERBERT COLLECTION.
CYCLOMANIA.
Chapter II.
Although I promised Spboggeb last night that I would write at
once for a " Number One Shoreditch Zephyr," I haven't done so yet.
Habkawat, who evidently stands in some awe of Spboggeb as an
authority on wheeling," on the other hand offers to "send me to
Coventry," as he puts it, for one of their " glorious Ne Plus Ultras."
Or, he suggests, with a legal eye to a compromise, "if not that, why
not a ' Coventry Corrugated Convertible,' which is almost as good."
"Why is it called a Convertible P" I ask.
"Because you can tip it up so easily," growls Spboggeb, a fanatic
in the cause of the " Zephyr."
"Well," I remark, not wishing to cause a tricycling blood-feud
between Spboggeb and Habkawat, "what do you say to a ' Royal
Phlegethon?' I Bee it's advertised as ' learnt in an hour by a mere
child. Impossible to fall off. A miracle of oheapness and dura-
bility. The Phlegethon never takes a' header.'" (I am not partial to
headers, I confess). "' The Phlegethon climbs a mountain easier than
another tricycle comes down it. Bidden the other day 450 miles in
six hours by a schoolboy of twelve.' That seems wonderful,
doesn't it?"
My friends, however, don't think much of it, as far as I can see.
It's flat sacrilege to suggest that any tricycle isn't perfect, and of
course they don't do that, but somehow they don't seem enthusiastic.
"Phlegethon? Oh; that's the sort poor young Fltjkkb was
riding when he capsized coming down the hill into Kingston
the other day, isn't it? It wasn't the fault of the machine so
much, I daresay; it was the road, you know. They'd been mending
it, the beggars! So he got pitched off, and had emphyteusis of the
ankle-bone—that'sail."
Won't ask any further questions about emphyteusis.
As the "Royal Phlegethon" is voted down—" dismissed with
oosts," Habkawat remarks—the whole question of what trioyole is
best for me to buy is reopened. Why not call it " the Battle of the
Bone-shakers?" As this would probably mortally offend both
Habkawat and Spboggeb, I don't mention it.
Finally, both Habkawat and I weakly acquiesce in Spboggeb's
original suggestion of a " Shoreditch Zephyr." But when it arrives
—as it does with a celerity which, if I did not know Spboggeb's
spotless reotitude, I should consider suspicious—I find that the
number of additional necessary articles is simply legion.
I ask Harkawat and Spboggeb to come in and have a look at my
new acquisition. As Habkawat observes, "The jury then proceeded
to the stables to view the remains." They both pronounce it a
beauty, "to look at."
"But you must have a lantern, you know, and a bell," says
Habkawat, decisively.
"And a costume, of course," says Spboggeb.
"Yes," Habkawat adds; "dark blue, with stripes, might suit
you. And a trumpet; that's an essential thing."
"What's the good of having a trumpet?" I ask, doubtfully.
"Oh, to tootle as you go through a village, of oourse," they both
rejoin.
I shall have to practise tootling. Whenever I've tried I've made
my lips very sore, and the result in sound has been invariably feeble.
Why won't shouting do instead of "tootling"? The advantage of
this is that one hasn't to learn shouting.
Here is what my determination to be a " wheelman " has cost me
hitherto:—

your trioyole doesn't eat anything." This is absolutely true.
Sprogger and Haekawat (who have become fast friends in a
oouple of days) hold a kind of Council of War as to what is to be done
with me. I feel my fate is in their hands.
"You must"—Haekawat says, giving the decision of the Court—
"learn to ride immediately."
"Learn to wheel," Sprogger suggests.
"Yes, learn to wheel immediately," says Feed Haekawat,
aocepting the oorreotion. "Sprogger will take you to the plaoe "—
(What plaoe P Am at once unpleasantly reminded of the formula,
"to he taken to the place of execution, and there hanged by the
neck," &o)—" and have you thoroughly instructed. Then we 11 all
go a jolly spin down to Brighton, or somewhere."
This sounds tempting. Sprogger says he is willing, if he can get
the leave of the Captain of the "West Kensington Dragonflies."
Leave I Is the Captain of a Tricycling Club a despot r I ask
Sprogger.
"Oh dear, no," he replies; "but then you see it is considered bad
Club form for a ' Dragonfly' to do a tour with any people who aren't
'Dragonflies,' you understand. But of course yon will both of you
join our Club, and then," he adds, oheerfully, "it will be all right."
80 it is settled that the journey to Brighton—which Sprogger
thinks will only take one day, though I know better—shall begin as
soon as ever I have "learnt to pedal my way about," as he pio-
turesquely puts it.
With a last lingering doubt in my mind, I ask Haekawat if I
shan't " get mixed up with the machinery "?
Haekawat wants to know, rather contemptuously, what machinery
I mean.
"Oh, I don't quite know," I reply, unsatisfactorily. On reflec-
tion, I find I have a notion of a dangerous sort of fly-wheel attached
to a trioycle. Fanoy I've been confusing a tricycle and a threshing-
machine. Shan't mention this to Haekawat.
In order to learn how to " pedal my way about," I am taken into
a shop in the City, and down a steep ladder into a large and dimly-
lighted cellar, and am told that this is the practising-ground.
The Instructor (who, I find, is also the owner of the shop, and
maker of the "Front-Steering Double-Gearing Liverpool Buster")
looks something between a second-rate jockey and a Dissenting
Minister in needy oircumstanoes. He eyes me critically, whioh I
don't like, and asks me to " throw my leg over this 'ere machine."
The art of learning to ride a trioycle is perfectly simple to anybody
who can accomplish three different objects simultaneously, which
are—To move the pedals properly, To prevent a horrible tendency to
slip off sideways, and Contrive to steer. While you endeavour to
master the first feat, and take delirious dabs at each pedal as it comes
round, you find yourself (if you are practising in a dark cellar, at
any rate) running up against a wall, or pillar. Then when you turn
the handles violently, to avoid a collision with the said wall or pillar,
you swerve round so as to be within an ace of being pitched out on to
the asphalte.
Sprogger, however, looks on encouragingly. Evidently, the chief
desire of my Instructor, the Dissenting Jockey, is to prevent my
running myself, and his machine (especially his machine) up against
anything solid.
He shouts loudly when there are breakers, so to speak, ahead.
Beyond this, and saving, "Capital! Capital!" now and then in a
cold official tone, he does nothing to earn his five shillings an hour.
He wants to know particularly "whether I'm suited with a
machine yet." When he hears that I am, and that he has no chance
of selling me a " Front-8teering Double-Gearing Buster," his interest
in me beoomes even less than before.
However, I don't care, because at the end of my hour I find I
really can go along '. After one or two days' practice, towards dusk,
in quiet roads near my own house, and being nearly ridden over by
my own butcher's cart, I really feel fit for the Brighton trip! I tell
Sprogger and Haekawat so.
"All right," says the latter, cheerily, "we '11 start the day after
to-morrow. Fantit and Clara" (his two sisters) "will ride the
'Sociable,' probably. Start 8'30 sharp. Breakfast Croydon, lunch
Horsham, dinner Brighton."
Somehow, I wish Fannt Haekawat were not to come with us. I
have every confidence in my "Shoreditoh Zephyr," and my own
powers as a wheelman up to a certain point,—or, rather, an uncertain
point, for I don't quite know where that point is to be,—and, if an
accident should occur, I would rather that she did not see it.
That's all. It i3 fixed that we start on Tuesday, at 8'30 " sharp."

Savage Old Father. Chante! Chant.-
Lakmi. Chante? Shan't!
PETS FROM PARIS.
(Mile. Van Zandt and Madame Jane Hading at the Gaiety.)
Maste Vaw Zandt is delightful in that rather absurd and
decidedly lugubrious Opera, Lakmi. Her vocalisation is well worth
sitting out the Opera,
whioh, without her, would
be a serious trial. It is
but fair to say, however,
that the Opera has been
so cut about as to be a
very different affair from
what it was in Paris,
where some entertainment
of a light and refreshing
character was provided by
an English Governess.
The two British OfEoers,
one of whom, Gerald, is
the tenor-lover, might be
described as a oouple of
"Heavies." The illus-
tration represents the
scene where Lakmi is
bothered by her cruel and
revengeful old father to
sing in order to attract
her lover, whom he means
to kill. Unconscious of
her father's design,
Lakme sings until she
can't sing any more.
"Chante encore!" growls
the old father, savagely.
But she can't " chante," and is just giving up when in comes Gerald,
and is spotted and then potted by the irate Brahmin.
Jane Hading comes out strong in a weak piece, the Prince Zilah.
The Prologue, whioh gave a sort of Adelphl melodramatic tone to
the play, has been left out. When I saw it in Paris, it was perfectly
evident to any playgoer that the Prologue was entirely unnecessary,
except from the Author's point of view, as a pure matter of business,
so that, by occupying the
entire evening, he might be
able to collar ten per cent,
on the gross reoeipts, to
which sum, after deducting
a small amount for the
poor, the French Dramatist
is legally entitled. This
arrangement is an ad-
mirable one; the Law puts
the Author, with his
maiden effort, on the samo
footing with the Author
who has written and pro-
d uoed twenty, or a hundred.
There can be no haggling,
or bargaining, or any un-
pleasantness about the
business transaction. Law
has settled it for the Society
of Dramatio Authors in
France; and if a Dramatist
makes as big a name as
Sabdott, he can demand a
'prime," or a retainer, or
anything he likes, by way
of bonus, over and above
his "Author's rights,"
which are secured to him
by Law; and this system, enforced by the authority of the Law, is
exactly what we want here. When such a law exists, I warrant
there '11 be no dearth of good Plays, and it would be then worth
while to follow the Frenoh example and collaborate. However, I am
not going to discuss this question, now, or here. It will keep. Let
us return to Jane Hading, and Damala, the latter of whom is much
the same in everything.
As Marsa had already a lover, and, as she had once thought, a
husband, in Count Menko, who is subsequently nearly eaten up by
lavage dojrs— whioh two characters are very dangerous dramatically—
Prince Zilah becomes de trop, and so the title of the piece ought to
be Zilah hare to Spare; or, Going to the Dogs, which perhaps may
be adopted at the St. James's, if they do it, or elsewhere. The piece
is not worthy of Madame Jane Hading's performance. I prefer her
in Le Mattre de Forges. Sarah is coming!! Nibbs.

THE BRITON'S BEER SONG.
(Latett Veriion.)
"We must express our decided preference for increasing the taxation on
beer and spirits as compared with that on tea. The present taxation of beer
is not enough to hinder the consumption of an amount of it altogether in
excess of the physiological or dietetic requirement of the body. It stiffens
the joints and besots the intellects of the labouring classes."—The Lancet.
On, what's a poor man without muscle and brain?
(That moral the Lancet most pungently points),
So lots of cheap beer must to labour be gain,
For it muddles its mind and it stiffens its joints!
So tax what you like, Gents, tax sugar, tax tea,
But see that the Working-man's "lush " is not dear!
And turn out the Statesman, whoever he be,
Who'd rob the poor man of cheap beer!

The Pungolo of Naples, considering the failure of the International

a charge! Fancy England being considered—and by Naples—as the Dirty Boy
amongst Nations f England, with her " Healtheries," her Sir Henry Thompson,
her " Housing of the Poor'' Crusades, her Dust-hole Demonstrations, where moBt
of the time not absorbed by talking about Politics and Sport seems to be devoted
to discussion of Cleanliness and Sanitation! Hygeia-ridden, almost to excess,
at home, can England be regarded as the enemy of hygiene abroad? It is
preposterous, and shows once more how difficult, in the face of foreign prejudioe,
it is for John Bull to demonstrate that, in matters Political, Commercial,
Moral, and Hygienic, he is immaculate. What wonder Germany charges Glad-
stone with Tartufferie, that Ireland brands Spencer as a fiend, when Naples—
that "great centre of infection," as the Roman Riforma calls it—which of late
has given a new and ghastly significance to the old vaunt, " See Naples, and die,"
charges England with hostility to its newest, most potent, and most widely

GREAT HANDLE FESTIVAL OF 1885.
(From Dumb-Crambo Junior's Point of View.)
THE SHIP OF STATE.
'"(The Liberals had run the Ship on the rocks."—Sir William
Hal i Dykb.
"Mr. Ebnbst Hart said Mr. Gladstone had been driven
from the helm just as he had steered the Ship of State into the
haven of Electoral Reform, with Five Millions of enfranchised
Voters standing on the Bhores."
Oh, nautical metaphors many and various!
Oh, which with the public at large shall prevail?
Is the Ship in a state that is truly precarious?
Is the Snip just in harbour, and lowering sail?
Which, which is the cry for the coming Election?
Billy Dyke he speaks out like a five-liner Whip^—
"Mr. Gladstone's been 1 scuttling' in every direction,
And now, at the last, he has scuttled the Ship!"
Ernest Hart, at Mile End, says, "Our Gladstone 'a
been driven
From the helm, and the haven of goodly Reform ;"
That the barque (like poor Shelley's) to tempest is given.
And he can t think the Tories will weather the storm.
But Five Millions, he cries, of New Voters are standing,
And shouting like bricks, on Electoral shores.
They '11 cheer for their Gladstone, and welcome his
landing.
And return his supporters by hundreds and scores!
'Tis a little confusing. I '11 just let alone a

CYCLOMANIA.
Chapter III.
On the morning of the start for our " Spin to Brighton" Hark-
away turns up clad in what he calls a "blazer," whioh makes him
look like a nigger minstrel out for a holiday. Sprogger, who does not
see the vulgarity of his own "Dragonfly suit, seems really pained.
"My dear fellow," he says, are you actually going in that
costume?"
"Why not ?" asks Harkaway, rather abashed.
"Oh, nothing," returns Sprogger, and relapses into silence, but
continues to regard Harkaway's coat (which I think cheerful) with
a look in which sorrow rather than anger is predominant.
Am glad to find that neither Fanny Harkaway nor her sister is
to come with us. They, it seems, are going to Brighton by train, in
spite of all the contempt they once lavished on that form of loco-
motion. "But they've promised," says Harka way, "to meet us
on the road near Brighton about six this evening."
Query—How shall J be looking about six this evening?
Sprogger and Harka way, whenever they are at all near me, eye
my riding critically, and say nothing. This silence is oppressive.
Wonder if I am riding—I mean wheeling—properly. Put extra
strength into my leg delivery, so to speak, and miss the pedal, or
treadle. • Like " catching a crab " in rowing, only worse. Nearly
jolted over front wheel into road.
"Don't she wobble rather f" Harka way says to Sprogger.
"She," I find, is my machine. Sprogger still gloomy and
reticent. His manner, I feel, is distinctly ominous as to the
prospects of my ever reaching Brighton.
"Do you hear that nasty jingling ?" Harka way says, in another
hundred yards or so, again referring to my machine. I do wish
Harkaway would attend to his own business. I don't mean his
legal business, because I know he hasn't any. Shall tell him so in a
minute, if he doesn't take care.
Sprogger still maintains an obstinate silence, from which I infer
the worst. Hang it all! Why can't he tell me my faults plainly P
"Look here! I say, appeahngly, "If my style of riding—I mean
wheeling—is wrong" (here I give an extra push to the pedal, and
catch another crab) "I can alter it; but don't sit like a Sphinx"—
(Don't think Sphinx as a simile for a man on a tricycle is happy.
Too late to recall it)—" and say nothing!"
Sprogger is evidently touched. He remarks, soothingly, but
unsatisfactorily,
"Oh, it's nothing, nothing at all. Of oourse" (condescendingly)
"you can't be expected to get 1 Dragonfly' form all at once. I was
only looking at the tire of your off-wheel."
He then sees what he calls " a nice level for a fast spin," where he
can " beat record time," and starts ahead.
What on earth is the matter with the tire of my off-wheel, 1
wonder? If it goes seriously wrong, will the off-wheel become a
wheel off? I do wish Harkaway and Sprogger wouldn't ride so
fast.
Seeing a horse approaching that looks frisky (at a considerable
distance), I seize the opportunity to pull up and go very'slowly past
him. This gives me a rest; also gives me a chance of admiring the
scenery, which Sprogger, as a soul of London clay, doesn't seem to
care two straws for.
Sprogger comes back and asks me, irritably, "if I'm practising
for a funeral?"
I feel huffed, and retort, satirioally, "My dear fellow, I don't
pretend to be a professional tricyclist."
"No necessity to explain that,'' returns Sprogger, rudely, and
again fixes his cold grey eye on my machine. Believe he's
mesmerising it. Wonder if he has any occult power over " Shore-
ditch Zephyrs," and if that was the reason he made me buy one?
Pass through a suburban village. Sprogger thinks it necessary
to get out his trumpet, and " tootle." This excites the village dog,
who rushes at my machine, because I bring up the rear. Horrible
thought—perhaps he's mad i What a fool he must be, anyhow, not
to try and bite Sprogger, who is " tootling," instead of me, who am
doing nothing. Wish to goodness " tootling" was " bad ' Dragonfly'
form."
Curious fact that Sprogger, although he says he's " done the road
hundreds of times," doesn't seem to know the way, so that we go
wrong, and travel several miles out of our course. Sprogger says,
cheerfully, that " this is good luck for me," as it gives me " so much
more praotioe."
I ask Harkaway, in confidence, "how much further it is to
Brighton." He says "forty-six," and we've "only done eight so
far."
Only eight miles! I thought we'd done at least sixteen. I suggest
stopping for breakfast at a nice suburban hotel which we pass.
Can't breakfast before Croydon," says Sprogger, firmly.
"Why not?" I ask.
"Bad form for a 'Dragonfly' to breakfast anywhere before
Croydon." is his unsatisfactory reply. "Besides," he adds, " that's
not a Wheelman's House."
Find, on inquiry, that there is no "Wheelman's House " before we
reach Croydon. Ithen propose that they should ride on, and—I add,
confidently—"I'll catch 'em up." They evidently don't relish my
pace, and agree heartily, and I fall behind; and, when Sprogger
and Harkaway are well out of sight, I walk slowly up the next
hill, which I can't do when they are with me, as walking up bills is
"bad wheeling form."
Feel refreshed. Right out of London now. Hurrah! Here's a
nice bit of country road. A Farmer's cart just ahead. Why not
catch it up and pass it?

RIVER PUZZLE.
Smith and Jones, forgetting the Size of their House-Boat, have genially asked "One or Two Friends" at various
Times. The* all choose the same Day for a Visit. Pczzle evident.
I do. Never felt bo serenely triumphant in my life. Believe
Farmer is asleep. Such carelessness inexcusable. Shout " Yoioks!"
and he wakes up with a start, and begins to use strong country
dialect. Luckily I am a good way ahead by the time he has com-
pletely realised the situation.
It's a little up-hill now. Shall I get off and walk? Farmer
might think me a fool. The "Shoreditch Zephyr" seems to object
to gentle slopes—so do I. Feel curious sensation in my thighs.
They seem as if lumps of lead were forming in them. Think of poor
young Fluker. Wonder if this is how emphyteusis' of thigh-bone
begins.
That confounded Farmer is catching me up! He is whipping his
horse. How unfair! Evidently he intends to pass me. Feel put on
my mettle (no time now to think out joke about being "on my
metal") ; trying to evolve extra speed, catch a disastrous crab, and
feel hot all over. Believe I can hear Farmer laughing behind.
He is passing me.
Farmer's wheel (intentionally, I think) shaves mine so closely that
I give a swerve, and nearly go into ditch. This amuses Farmer, who
offers to take me in tow if I'm feeling tired.'' I want a repartee
for this. If I said, "What have you got in your cart, Farmer?"
he might reply, being evidently a ready man,—a rough-and-ready
man,—" Chaff!" ana I shouldn't get the best of it. Pass him in
silence. Perhaps he '11 insult Sprogger and Harkaway, and they
can have a row with him, if they like.
Five Milet beyond Croydon.—Harkaway and Sprogger leagues
ahead. Didn't know a road could have so much dust. Never felt
half so thirsty before. Every limb aches. And this is called
pleasure!
One peculiarity, I find, of the "Shoreditch Zephyr" is that the
cog-band comes off every two miles or so. This necessitates my
stopping and oiling myself all over in Herculean endeavours to get it
over the cogs again. If Sprogger was here should make joke about
throwing oil on the troubled trioycle," and watoh how he took it.
Going down-hill now. How easily it—I mean " she "—goes. Why
can't all roads be made down-hill?
Travelling faster. This is splendid I What's that idiot shouting
to me for? Asks " if I don't see the board P"
"What board '?" I shout back to him, but he's suoh a long way
behind that I can't hear his answer.
Think I must be doing twenty miles an hour. Wonder if I am
"beating record time "? Comfort to know I can put on break at
any moment.
Hill getting much steeper. Try to put on break. Doesn't seem to
diminish speed. What am I to dor1 At this moment think of
"Royal Phlegethon," which " never takes a header." WiBh I'd got a
"Royal Phlegethon." Also think of " poor young Fluker."
Am certainly being run away with. Awful situation. Feel like
Mazeppa (on ner Zephyr—joke good, but very ill-timed). Guide
machine, in despair, up a grass bank and into hedge. Tremendous
lurch. Bang! Crash! I'm all among the wreckage.
Glad neither Sprogger nor Harkaway anywhere near. Query—
Is being spilt (and nearly kilt) off a trioyole "bad 'Dragonfly'
form?" Still more glad Fanny Harkaway didn't come with us.
On calmly surveying the situation, I find total result of spill to be
as follows:—
1. Lamp smashed to atoms.
2. Saddle bent double.
3. Backbone of "Zephyr" curved gracefully bo as to scrape ground.
4. Coat torn to ribbons.
5. Tire off one wheel.
Tired of the three wheels. But what on earth am I to do?

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Howe of Commons, Monday Night, June 15.—Every appearance
of quiet evening. The Markiss has undertaken to form Administra-
tion. Nothing to do but for old tenants quietly to clear out. Glad-
stone in humblest, most conciliatory mood. Last week he came and
went unnoticed. Now makes his way into House through oheering
multitudes. Cheered again
when he takes his seat,
cheered when he rises,
cheered when he sits down.
"Seems to me, Toby,"
says he, "that the way to
be truly popular is to get
yourself turned out. Must
remember this for new Par-
liament, If about 1890 I
find things not going very
well, shall lose a big divi-
sion."
Randolph in his place
twirling moustache with
suspicious savagery. Wolff
sitting well forward on edge
of benoh, hat tipped over bis
spectacles. "Toby, dear
boy," said Randolph, " ever
see two old fogies walking
along the road arm-in-arm,
confidentially conversing,
thinking they've settled
everything? Ever see small
boy with piece of string
pulled across pavement at
convenient height? Ever
see the two old fogies tumble
over the string? No? Well,
keep your eyes open to-
night.'1
Gladstone briefly made
suggestions for arrangement
of business. Consider Lords'
Amendments to Seats Bill
forthwith; then adjourn
till Friday, so that Markiss may make his Ministry. Noethcote
agreed to what was very ordinary proposal. Motion made to con-
sider Lords' Amendments to the Seats Bill. Wolff roBe and moved
Adjournment of Debate. Protested against Lords inserting Clause
accelerating operation of Registration Act. Could not think of dis-
cussing so important a proposal as this in absence of responsible
Government and of responsible Opposition. "Another trick this of
a Liberal Government."
"Beg your pardon," says Dilke—" it was done at the request of
Lord Salisbuby."
"Quite true," Staffobd Noethcote chimed in, always chivalrous,
never shirking behind opportunities of evading responsibility.
Evidently mischief ahead. Might have left the Government to work
their own way with quarrel being raised by Fourth Party. But, to
Sir Staffobd Noethcote, truth is truth, sacred above all things; so
now he came forward, and volunteered this testimony.
Rather a staggerer, this. Made the issue unmistakably clear.
Randolph and his Merry Men not fighting against Gladstone, but
against Salisbuby. Would they accept the issue? Randolph
quickly replied—
"Yes. Battle, and no quarter!" and forthwith, amid cheers and
laughter from the delighted Ministerialists, he proceeded to sneer at
"the Leaders of the so-called Constitutional party."
"A pretty beginning, this, to the establishment of a strong and
united Party. But it's only Randolph's fun," said Sydney Wateb-
low, who, having caught the train, was present on this interesting
occasion. "He must have his fling. But you '11 see the Party will
stand by its Leader."
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach on his legs. Now Randolph
will catch it, and Staffobd Nobthcote will find his authority
justified. Beach an old colleague of Nobthcote's, an intimate
counsellor, a companion in the adversity of the Front Opposition
Bench. Randolph's proceeding strikes at all discipline. It is not
Staffobd Nobthcote alone that suffers by these attacks. It is the
Conservative party, and above all the Front Opposition Bench.
St. Michael to the rescue!
To general surprise Beach turned and stabbed his old colleague,
who sat trustfully by his side. Threw over Nobthcote, bearded
Sa LisHUKiY.and declared for Randolph.
Sir W. Y. Harcourt (as Mr. Pecksniff,
at St. James's Hall). "Lord Randolph
Churchill"—{groans and hisses) — "'do
not let us groan at our opponents.' Nay,
my Christian brethren, do not let us groan
or hiss at our opponents. We can find
other ways of dealing with them."
"Sir Michael," I cried, "what in the name of All Angels do.you
mean Fj^Do you think this is quite honourable P"
"Well, perhaps not HiCKs-aokly," he said, hanging down'bis
head. "But you see I'm like the Solicitor from Sunderland who
gave evidence in the Lotinga Insurance case the other day, and
described himself as an unwilling witness. 'Why do you say you
are an unwilling witness?' Hawkins asked. 'Beoause I didn't want
to be mixed up in a case like this, as I'm a young man making my
way in the world.' I'm a young man making my way in the world.
Very unpleasant to be mixed up in case like this. But have no
choice, and being in must consider which side's likely to win.
Nobthcote old friend, and that sort
of thing; been very kind to me;
always loyal; sort of second father,
don't you know. But he's played out.
Randolph coming to the front, will
get to the front, has promised to take
me with him if I play his game now.
Very awkward. I know people will
say things. Don't feel altogether easy
myself. But as 'a young man making
my way in the world' mustn't be too
sentimental."
After this defection and desertion
matters assumed serious aspect. Rukes
also plucked up courage to desert
Noethcote, Chaplin declared for
Randolph, and when division was
called StLATEK-BooTn was so bemused
and muddled that he got into the
wrong lobby. Randolph heavily
beaten in the division lobby; "but,"
says the Sage of Queen Anne's Gate,
"he's won nis game. Markiss must
either knuckle down and accept his
terms, or must form a Ministry and
leave him below the Gangway. In
either case he '11 be master of the situa-
tion."
Businett done.—Randolph revolts,
Hicks-Beach deserts, House adjourns
till Friday.
Friday Night.—" 'Pon my word,"
said Sir Charles Fobsteb, mopping
his forehead, " don't know whether I'm
a Commoner or a Peer; whether I'm
Lord Chancellor with a seat in the
Cabinet and another on the Woolsack:
whether I'm Solicitor-General, Lord
Chanoellor of Ireland, First Lord of Treasury, or merely Prime
Minister; whether I'm a Liberal or a Conservative. Politics, com-
bined with a tendency to misplace one's hat, have always been ex-
haustive. A little more of this, and I 'd have to leave you, and then
where would you be? Oh dear 1 oh dear!"
The good Baronet wobbled off, shaking his head, a picture of
belated humanity. Things are truly a little mixed. Conservatives
were to have come into possession to-day, and everybody change
places. Turns out to be all a mistake. Gladstone not yet gone,
and Salisbuby not yet in. Nobody knows where he is himself, or
where to find others. Adjourn till Tuesday, to think matter over,

AT BURLINGTON HOUSE. THE 11 SWARILY."
THE NUBIAN BLACK KING WARREN-TED.
His Majesty Oko Jumbo, who likes to look every inch a king,
wanted to go about wearing a regal crown. It was pointed oat to
him by Sir John Monckton, who received him in the City and in-
structed him in several points of etiquette, that a white hat was
quite sufficient, as, when perfect, it always had a crown in it. Oko
was satisfied. His personal conductors say that it is quite a game
of chess for them. Blaok King moves over all the squares, and, this
sounds unfortunate, is taken everywhere. Match-making Mammas
want to know if Black King is mated?
COMMENT ON THE CRISIS.
(By One who Knout.)
The itch for office, at its highest pitch,
Is of ttimes disappointed by a hitch.
At a Matinee.—Crowd outside watching Theatrical Celebrities
going in. "There goes Toole I" "There goes Ibvtno!" Then
came Misses Ellen and Marion Terbt. Boy cried out, "There
goes the Show in Hexhibition Road. Kensington!" The people saw
it at once. The explanation was, In-went-Terries." The boy has
been sent to the Sanatorium, where he will be duly oared for and
properly instructed.
The ErorunoNABT Squadron.—Darwinites.
Mem. by a Misogynist.
[Seven Ladies hare passed as Wranglers at Cambridge.]
Fob mathematio fame they've long been anglers,
And now they 're—seven of them—Complete Wranglers.
Nor let the news poor Man unduly stagger;—
She's Wrangler now who always wot a nagger.
Cook Insects, destroy Beetles, eat Crickets; but there's one sort
of Insect everybody is perpetually dressing up and dishing for him-
self and friends, one sort of Insect which we all swallow, willingly,
after a little time, for it is an acquired taste, and that Insect is, the
Humbug of Society.
Wk are not aware to what ecclesiastical school Canon F reeii antle
belongs, but if names went for anything, his would' be an excellent
one for a Ritualist who considers himself at liberty to wear what-
ever vestments he pleases. Such a one would indeed be a " Free-
mantle."
At the end of last week the Recently Proposed Conservative
Ministry were said to be taking lessons in dancing. They were pre-
paring tor a good " breakdown."
Disqualification for Medical Relief.—Not having anything
at all the matter with you.

Dear Polly,
Yes, I've 'ooked him fair this time; there's no mistake about it.
You was a nasty jealous sort, you was, to go and kind o' doubt it.
I wouldn't ha' thought it of you, now. But there, perhaps 'twas all
your funning,
I send his photo took with me. and think you'11 own he's really stunning.
Isn't he just a tip-top
swell? Two quid a
week, he says, his
screw is;
He's something in the
'atting line, his name
is Joseph Hexery
Lewis.
He might be a Italian,
dear, his 'air's so long
and black, and shiny,
A 'anging all about
his neck in lovely rin-
glets tight and twiny.
My mark hexact, my
dear; in fact I always
had a sort o' fancy
For something of a

He only wants an inch

cisely like that Kernel
As saved the Countess

did it, dear; that,

He says that for your
skinny sort he doesn't
care not half a jig-
ger.
His taste's so good;
and that there hat, a
bright green silk
with yaller feather,
Caught his hartistic
eye at once, and settled
of him altogether.
It stood me seven-and-
tuppence odd — a

Her and her ossifer, indeed! Didn't it nettle and surprise her.
When going to the Pallis, dear, a fly on which she'd reglar reckoned,
'Er long-legged lobster took her third, whilst me and Joseph we went
second!
Oh, it was proper! What I like in life is jinks and all things jolly;
But snubbing stuck-up enemies do make it all the sweeter, Polly.
I ain't a mealy, no, not me; your pious sort is small pertaters;
All real ladies go it swell, starched ones is always second-raters.
I do 'ate starch; it's only fit for old maids' caps and parsons' collars.
I likes a girl who "s up to sprees, and game to dash about the dollars;
That's reglar first-class form, my dear. Modesty? Meekness? Thrift?
Oh jimminy!

A lady ain't no call to

The style's the thing.

Dear Prime Meri-

course you 're only a
lineal parvenu, quite a
"new Line " as it were,
whilst I've been estab-
lished for ages. Still I
wish you well, now that
you've acquired the
respectability of a
■' local habitation and
a name." People talk
disparagingly of " hard
and fast Lines," but
they are the only re-
spectable Lines, after
all. Look at those
shifty nomadic Isobars
and Isothemials. I'd
as soon be a clothes-
line! However, you've
settled down, so I
"drop you a Line " of
recognition and con-
gratulation. Trust you
have fallen in pleasant
places — Greenwich
doesn't sound very
swell—but you mustn't
expect the life of even
a fixed Line to be all beer and skittles. Not at all, I assure you. Even /
have been "spoken disrespectfully of," and am "crossed " continually.
But keep yourself select, and in Bix thousand years or so I may even
be able to bow to you when we meet. You will not expect that yet, of
course. Must draw the Line somewhere. In these days when new
Lines are turning up continually—nulla dies sine Lined as somebody
says—one can't be too particular. But I wish you well—from a suitable
distance—and remain, that original " ancient Line," The Equator,
OF THINGS."

Would you warble a lyric of love,
Of Love in the latter-day style?
Go snatch a white plume from Dame Venus's dove,
For your Poet's a party superbly above
A Gillott or goose-quill. How vile
The vulgarian varlet who'd tinkle-te-tink
His love on a banjo, or write it in ink?
We must thrumb out our love on a lute.
'Tis the instrument most eommc ilfaut —
Though whether the thing's like a fiddle or flute.
Or sounds with a twangle or tootle-te-toot,
I '11 be hanged if I happen to know:
But Stbephon—in rhyme—always has it at hand,
And this song is a lute-song you '11 please understand.
It is set in three flats I may say,
In the very much minor, of course;
That's a sine qua non in an amorous lay,
When inspired by the Muse of this lachrymose day,
Who is always delightfully hoarse
With weeping, for latter-day lovers rejoice
Like the cats on the tiles, and with tears in their voice.
If you do not quite relish the style
Of love-lyric, 1 've no more to say;
But you'd better not try, for it is not worth while
(And you'd only elicit Song's scornfullest smile),
Your hand at an amorous lay.
Try the drum if you like, or the fiddle or flute,
But you 11 never make much of a fist with the lute.

PUNCH'S ALMANAOK FOR 1885.
I December 9, IBM.
THAT JOKE!



'Twas in the twitriar
chal period, when
Men dwelt in tents,
and watched, with
due attentiveness,
Mock* which MM

men.
Fashion and
mentiveness.
A simi>]e time, but dullish, one
would say;
It was before the Pun had been
invented;
And in its absence how couhl men be
gay.
Or perfectly contented?
One night at a tent-door a j«rty sat.
Things all went wrong; Afcou had burst
his tabor,
Ben Abram's latest desert myth fell flat;
Each herdsman bored his neighbour;
When on a sudden through the silence broke
A something! Then, of course, thev had uo nana- for !t.
Ben Zol had perpetrated the Unit JOKE!
(And earned eternal shame for It.)
A Lion pouncing In their midict had not
Produced so great a shock, so quick a scattering;
Each man rose hastily and left the spot;
This to Bun Zol seemed flattering;
But nought to what came next. Anon there rose
From palm-clump, and from sand-ridge, and from pool-
edge,
Most novel noises ; the spasmodic throes
Of a new birth of knowledge.
Al Rap exploded like a bursten dyke,
ILuiet boomed nasally, like a flying scarab,
And A8SAR bounded, wriggled, twisted, like
A Beui-Zoug-Zoug Arab t
Om did not catch the Joke 1 At the tent-door
He squatted, watching every novel antic.
Thinking that it was all a horrid bore;
And that they'd all gone fr
Thev nil rushed back! Ben Zol was like to choke
With their ••tnbracea. Like to wasj>* round honey
They clustered, begging him to repeat the Joke,
And once again be "lunny " 1
That Joke went forth! That patriarchal Jest
Spread like the rinderpest, or Jews, or rabbits,
And altered, North and South and East and West,
Man's euatouis, Woman's habits.
With it the Pyramid-builders did beguile
Their leisure house; it came so well iu Coptic.
In Accad dialect it made NiNts smile,
And wink his royal optic.
At Kouyunjik some early chisel-pen
Has carved a Babylonian much contorted;
That shows the sort of thing which hapjwned when
That Joke was first imported.
It has been taken for a tortured slave,
Or an Aasyrian Conqvest. Not a bit of It!
'Twas in such fashion all men would behave
When waking to the wit of it.
Tin* Persians introduced the "wheeze " to Greece;
A prisoner nabbed at Marathon imparted it
To his two captors. Laughter would nor cease
When ouce the Joke had started it;
So, while thry held their sides, hr made
Miltuhes vowed that nought
them.
Till one of them retold tHe Persian's jape,
When he at once forgave them.
The Romans borrowed it, with other " cribs,"
Tkreni k inscribed it in his pungent pages;
It played oldgoosel>erry with the monks' fat ribs
Tbiough Dark and Middle Ages.
The Normans brought it hither. Here, at last,
After eight centuries more of constant wear, it
Became so stale, that suffering men, aghast.
Vowed they'd no longer bear it.
Like that Egyptian skeleton, it lurked
At good men's feasts, till they, for once in unity,
Saw Uiat to have the Horror safely burked
Concerned the whole community.
....
The Joke waa dead, as dead as Pharaoh's dllftt,
Aa Death's own door-nail, aa defunct Joe Miller.
Who killed It? Well, the doom waa deemed so Just,
That Law Bought not the killer.
"Twas dead and burled, underneath a heap
Of last year's novels, in a place none wotted of;
Men blessed him who that Joke had sboked In sleep,
Or severed the carotid of:
Folks breathed.
About all places where mankind ease
For grub and goaaip. What the rumour meant
Men asked, and paled and trembled.
It checked In midmost flow the diner's glee:
It choked the story-teller's raciest chortle.
Could there, oh, couW there be an inside key
To Death's portentous portal?
"Whv no '. Ha ! ha !—of course not! Most absurd!"
So blustered Brum at a board convivial;
Then stopped, and shook. A chuckling sound was hear*,
As cause for trembling trivial.
Trivial f The con rices' hair stood all a-point
What said that Spectre grim in vaporous sable clot
• M-kfi, • t" Yah I they hinged at even- Joint,
And flopped upon the tablecloth I
Back came that ancient lately-shifted yoke,
Which they d thrown ofl", and made so glad a boast of 1H
Was it that old, old Patriarchal Joke?
Nay.
