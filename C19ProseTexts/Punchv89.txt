THE REVOLUTIONARY SQUADRON.
(Some Later Particulars Communicated.)
If there has hitherto been in certain quarters some doubt ex-
pressed as to the exact meaning of the word "Revolutionary,"
when taken in connection with the carrying out of an apparently
simple Programme of Nautical Manoeuvres, there cannot be any
longer the remotest question as to its perfeot applicability to the
recent doings in Bantry Bay. In fact, the experience of the last
few days has, to use the words of the now astonished but still gallant
Admiral in command, "so completely revolutionised and turned
topsy-turvy all preconceived ideas of Naval Tactics, and their neces-
sary adjuncts, as heretofore understood at Whitehall," that, while
retaining, under pressure, the important post he at present fills, he
cannot, in view of the forthcoming Demonstration promised shortly
for Spithead, refrain from throwing out a few admonitory hints to
his unsophisticated brother Commanders who may, possibly be
called upon to figure more or less prominently before the Public on
that interesting occasion. That these worthy Salts may the more
easily and readily apprehend the precise nature of the unexpected
difficulties they may be oalled npon to encounter, the thoughtful
Admiral has, in sailor-like fashion, condensed his recent experience
off the Irish Coast into the shape of some simple and practical
Rules, the value of which, not only in mimic warfare, but more
especially in actual operations in the presenoe of an enemy, must be
seen at a glance by the merest outsider. A few of the more strik-
ing and important of them are subjoined. They are as follows:—
1. As a rule, never go into aotion, if you can possibly help it, with
your ship bottom upwards.
2. If unsupplied by the Authorities with proper despatch vessels,
in any pressing emergency fall baok upon a torpedo boat, and if this
crumples up at once, as it probably will with rough usage, like brown
paper, requisition the nearest port for a coal-barge or two, and man
them with any war correspondents who happen to be on board.
Failing this, get into your own dingy after dark and take the
message as well as you can yourself to the nearest marine post-office.
3. If in command of one of H.M.'s first-olass four-masted
Thunderers, on sighting an enemy, prepare for aotion by instantly
hacking down the whole of her rigging, sails, spars, and tackle, and
bodily stowing it away in the Senior Officers' Mess-room. Here let
it be out up into convenient lengths and conveyed to the furnaces.
By a rapid recourse to this handy device, not only may the smashing
in of the ship's upper-decks and decimation of her crew be pleasantly
avoided, but an additional knot an hour be comfortably added to her
usual pace; a gain, which, when she makes but seven and a half
under full pressure, though pursued by nine armed cruisers whose
normal rate is never under eighteen, may be regarded as a distinct
and oonsoling advantage, not only to her crew and officers, but even
to her constructor and country.
4. A properly constituted modern Fleet should have its corpus or
body of heavy ironclad fighting power, and be supported by a eon-
tingent of swift cruisers, supplemented again with scouts as feelers,
followed by a silent swarm of torpedo craft. A British Admiral
suddenly meeting this formidable array, should, if in command of
three grotesque and thinly-armoured vessels of an extinct type,
supplied with bursting muzzle-loading guns, instantly strike up
"Mule, Britannia.'" on the band of the Marines, if it happens to
be on board, and give the order to " Scuttle and fill." If, however,
at the time he should be powerfully supported, after the latest
approved fashion, by a couple of lightly-armed Boulogne steamers
and a converted Thames lighterman or two, it may then become
almost obligatory on him to endeavour to draw up some sort of plan
of action. If, notwithstanding this decent show of defiance, he is
sent to the bottom before he has time to put anything on paper, he
will, still not omitting the order to the band of the Marines to give
"Rule, Britannia!" go down quietly, and like a man.
5. On taking up a position on a new Station, the first thing to be
done is to ascertain the correctness of the Admiralty charts. This
may be accomplished by sending one of the most valuable ships of
the Fleet over an indicated rock. If a hole is instantly knocked in
her bottom, and all the steam-pumps within fifteen miles are hard
at work on her for three days and nights to keep her afloat, it may
be taken for granted that the chart is fairly correct.
6. The daily explosions of gas in the coal-bunkers shonld, if pos-
sible, be timed to come off in the evening, as a considerable saving
in the item of lighting could be effected by such an arrangement.
Moreover, they would accustom the crew to most of the sensations of
a successful night-attack by hostile torpedoes. When discipline
rather than surprise is the object, the catastrophe might be preceded
by the order, "Pipe all hands for a blow-up."
7. The oaptain of a turret-ship, on finding that though he may
manage to give his turret one good turn, it may suddenly get jammed
and absolutely decline to give him another, should instantly unship
his screw, reverse the position of his engines, and spin his ironclad
as well as he can round on its own axis. Thus not only revolving
the matter in his own mind, but the whole of his crew in the face of
the enemy, he may manage, by a well-sustained all-round fire, to
square the immediate difficulty.
Suoh are the brief rules, and it cannot be doubted but that, by a
careful adhesion to one or mors of them, the Spithead display will,
on the whole, be a brilliant and instructive affair.

SHERIFFS' DAY IN THE CITY.
Having the honour of being a Liveryman of the "Worshipful Com-
pany of Joiners, I received a very pressing Note from a Gentleman,
with a perfectly unintelligible signature, but which looked some-
thing like Kyuom b Nixem, imploring me to be at a Common Hall on
Wednesday last, at two o'clock, to support a certain Gentleman for
what would be to me the somewhat uncomfortable office of Sheriff.
Not only Sheriff of London, too, but Sheriff of London and Middle-
sex, so as to make sure, 1 suppose, of having a certain duty to
perform, to which I will not further allude. My first difficulty was
to find the Common Hall, little expecting that such a term of con-
tempt could ever be applied to beautiful Guildhall, but so it was;
and I entered its sacred precincts through a little wicket, over which
the name of my Worshipful Company was insoribed. There I found
the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor seated in solemn state, with
all the City Magnates around him, all of whom carried beautiful
bouquets, which they occasionally smelt at, as if the atmosphere of
the Common Hall was rather too common for them.
The Election of the Sheriffs was passing off quietly enough, when
a sombre Liveryman of most melancholy appearance asked permission
to put a question to the Candidates, and put it accordingly, bat as it
was very long and quite inaudible, it did not excite much enthu-
siasm. There were some half-dozen names put up, but everybody
voted for my unknown friend and for a very nioe fresh-looking but
somewhat juvenile Alderman, and that business was soon over.
Then stepped forth in most dainty fashion a Gentleman dressed in
full Court suit, with about the most flowery waistcoat 1 think I ever
saw. I was told by a kindly neighbour that the Gentleman in ques-
tion was the Treasurer of all the countless millions of the great Cor-
poration of the City of London, and always wore that magnificent
waistcoat as symbolical of wealth beyond the dreams of avarice. He
was received with a most cordial greeting, and re-eleoted to his
responsible, but doubtless very comfortable, office, unanimously.
My friend told me that he saw him on the 8th of last November,
when he thought the Corporation wanted just a little hint about their
extravagance, walk up to the Lord Mayor and hand him an enor-
mous purse, but which was quite empty; that the Lord Mayor took
the hint in the most good-tempered way, and communicated the fact
to the Court of Common Council, who have since been just a little
more economical.
Then followed a proceeding that I could not at all comprehend,
namely, the election of some half-a-dozen Ale-conners. This pro-
ceeding seemed to provoke a large amount of curiosity as to the
probable duties of these mysterious individuals, more especially as
there was a contested election for the apparently coveted office. A
learned Pundit in my vicinity informed us that an Ale-conner was
one who inquired into the condition of the Ale sold in the City, and
was derived from the Anglo-Saxon word cunnian, to inquire into,
but a remarkably jovial-looking Liveryman expressed it as his
opinion that it meant a man who knew a good glass of Ale when he
tasted it. The question was naturally asked why, if the Liverymen
of London, in Common Hall assembled, were so very particular about
the quality of the Ale supplied to the thirsty Citizens of London,
they were not equally particular about the Porter and Stout, and
why no Porter-conners or Stout-oonners were appointed, to which
very natural question the learned Pundit replied that Porter and
Stout were comparatively modern inventions, following rapidly upon
the discovery of Spanish Licorice, while the antiquity of Ale and the
importance attached to its quality were distinctly proved by the line
from Shakspeare, " Blessings on her heart, for she brewed Good
Ale!" This doubtful point being thus satisfactorily cleared up, we
all came away. J. Litque.
Memorable.
On June 24, when the House met at 5 p.m., Mr. Winn alone
represented the new Ministry on the Treasury Bench. With the
exception of a statement from Mr. Gladstone, and a notice from
Mr. Parnell, Mr. Winn had the business all to himself. He
"moved" sixteen times, though always remaining in the same place;
and he " withdrew," onoe, without retiring. This is so remarkable,
that in Hansard and all Parliamentary annals or records we order
that Wednesday, June 24, of this year, shall henceforth be known
only as " Winnsday."
Mb. Punch, for the eighty-ninth time, has refused a Peerage.
He has, however, requested that a collar may be bestowed on Toby,
and has been promised the reversion of a pair of garters.

[Jolt 4, 1885.

Manns wants but little here below,
But wanta that little strong.
LIGHTLY HANDELINQ.
(To the Crystal Palace with a friend to hear the Messiah.)
A oheat crowd at Victoria going down to the Palace, but we did it
very easily and comfortably on the High Level.
On suon an occasion as this, that is the Handel Festival, and
assisting,—not that I can assist thsm very much, but it's a phrase
we've adapted from the
French,—at the perform-
ance or sacred music, I
am feeling grave, serious,
and inclined to regard my
fellow travellers as en-
gaged with me on a sort
of pilgrimage. Bright
gloves and brilliant toil-
ettes would jar on me at
so solemn a function.
In this tranquil and
appropriate frame of
mind I am on the point
of entering the carriage,
when a slap on the shoul-
der oauses me to turn,
and I oome face to face
with my friend Bunsom,
in a light sporting dust-
coat, a bright grey under-
coat, white waistcoat,
sporting tie, masher
collar, striking trowsers,
resplendent boots, and
one of the whitest hats I
ever saw. He has a
race-glass slung round
him, a gardenia in his
button-hole, and in his
brilliantly-gloved hand a
stick with a silver knob
to it of suoh a size as to suggest a combination of a Drum-Major's
oane with a humble Cathedral Verger's wand. Bunsom is evidently
going down to some races.
"Races!" he exclaims, when I, with due gravity, pretend a tem-
porary interest in his mundane amusements. "Races, nol I'm
going down with you to hear the Crystal Palace Rorytorio." Indeed!
But then why dress like this P "Splendid sight," he goes on.
"Heaps of people—people you don't see anywhere else—and lots of
pretty girls. You know,'' he adds, giving me a nudge in the ribs
with his elbow, and smiling affably at a rigid old lady dressed in
what is evidently her best Sunday gown, "you know there are lots
of girls' schools taken to this sort of thing, and you do see some
rattling pretty, fresh faces."
Bunsom is full of this style of conversation. He is overflowing
with it. He has had, and is having, he informs me, a very gay
season; he is out every night, and every day. He is never at home.
He entertains at his Club,—by the way, he doesn't entertain me.
He is the delight of thousands. He is bored to death by invitations.
The Nobility and Gentry vie with eaoh other to obtain Bunsom's
society, and, in fact, as far as I can gather from his information, no
social or fashionable gathering, during the season, is complete with'
out Bunsom.
Now this is not the sort of companion I should choose with whom
to go to hear the Messiah. He won't talk of Handel, of Oratorios,
of Cathedrals, of sacred subjects, of the Revised Version, of the
recent disoovery of a primitive text, and so forth, but he tells me
how many excellent dinners he has had. He smacks his lips over the
Champagne he has consumed; he gives me, in a loud tone of voioe,
receipts for making certain tasty dishes,—and here, I am bound to
say, he seems to awaken considerable interest in the other Handelian
Pilgrims in our carriage, who are sitting silently regarding Bunsom,
and drinking in words of oulinary wisdom from Bunsom's lips. I
feel sure that, if the journey were a long one, we should all gradually
forget the object in view, and, under this strange Bunsom spell,
would And ourselves discussing recipes for good dishes, and the
vintages of '74, instead of the merits of the Messiah, Judas Macca
bteus, and other of Handel's compositions.
We troop on to the platform and into the Palace. In view of the
various refreshment-rooms and bars, it occurs to Bunsom that he
hasn't lunched. He must, he says, have something before he can
listen to musio. "Besides," he adds, "I don't oome so much for the
music, as to see the crowd. It's a wonderful Bight."
After ascertaining the exact position of his seat, which is next to
mine, he disappears, to procure what he calls " a snaok and a short
drink."
He is right. The crowd of singers above the orchestra is

An Eyre on the Organ.
wonderful sight. Mr. Manns arrives, then Madame Patey and Mr.
M aas. Their presence is acknowledged'by thousands of hands, and
an enthusiastic middle-aged gentleman near me, with a very shiny
bald head and resplendent new lavender kids, waves his hat and
beats his umbrella on the floor. Then the National Anthem is sung.
This creates a profound sensation. When it is finished, everyone
looks at everybody else with a satisfied air, and we all applaud with
an air of subdued self-congratulation, as if we had been singing it
ourselves, and were much pleased with our performance.
The enthusiastic gentleman, who had been privately and personally
conducting the
Anthem, keeping,
as it were, a check
upon the chorus
with his right
forefinger, and
ready to relieve
Mr. Manns at a
moment's notioe
if necessary, hav-
ing put his hat
down on his chair
in order to have
both hands free
for applause, now
suddenly sits on
it, and for the
next few minutes,
during the solo
and chorus, he
is occupied in
straightening it out and sedulously brushing it. The incident has
temporarily crushed his enthusiasm,—and his hat.
After this we settle down to business, and Mr. Manns, having
satisfied himself that everything is oorreot, starts the Overture.
Then up comes Mr. Maas, and, at the first notes of the tenor solo,
"Comfort ye my People," my mind goes back to hot Sunday after-
noons in Eton College Chapel, when we used to ask some subordinate
official what was to he the Anthem of the day, and were informed
that it would be " 'Oly, 'oly, 'Andel 'Allelujah Chorus." Mr. Maas
sings superbly, and is muoh applauded. Then follows a Chorus
which, like most other Handelian Choruses, begins effectively, and
soon becomes monotonous on account of the repetition of the words,
which, in this instance, are "And all flesh."
The rule of these Choruses seems to be, that first the people on the
right shall make a statement, or an assertion, musically, and that
this shall be immediately followed by the people on the left repeating
it louder, with just a tinge of annoyanoe in their tone. And then
the people in the middle try to mend matters by repeating the phrase,
in order to bring the two parties together; in which good office, after
some two dozen more repetitions, whioh become more and more self-
asserting eaoh time, on the one hand, and the retorts more and more
forcible on the other, they ultimately succeed, and then all join together
harmoniously, the Chorus ending in the most perfeot unanimity.
How many times " All flesh " is repeated I don't know, but I am
just beginning to wish that Handel nad remembered that" All flesh
is grass," and, accordingly, wants cutting, when Signor Foli starts
his bass part, and proceeds to give what seems to have been a
humorous illustration in the Composer's mind of the grand words,
"I will shake." Shake! Heavens, he shakes all over. It may be
musically heretical to express such an opinion, but for a serious
Composer like Handel to have hit upon no more appropriate setting of
the Prophet's celestial message than, when he comes on the words I
will shake," to make his Bass singer simply produce an all-round-
and-round shake, is, to my humble and un-Handelian thinking, a
puerile treatment, utterly unworthy of the sublimity of the subject.
And this, more or less, strikes me as true of all the fugues and
shakes, repetitions, and florid passages, when connected with sacred
words in this particular Oratorio.
Then the Chorus, "Purify the Sons of Levi," is much applauded.
Subsequently they sing what seems to be an Altercation Chorus,"
one side asserting " Unto us," and the other side warmly retorting
with the same words, and the dispute, as usual, is only set right
apparently, and brought to a satisfactory conclusion, by the inter-
vention of the people in the middle, when once more all ends happily.
Madame Albani's beautiful voioe is now heard with telling effect;
but, for the matter of that, there could not be a more perfeot quin-
tette than was represented by limes. Patey, Albani, Messrs. Maas,
Foli, and Santley.
The enthusiastic man with the bald head has quite recovered him-
self—not with his hat—and been giving Mr. Manns every possible
assistance by privately and personally conducting different portions
of the Oratorio. Just as we get to Number Nineteen, "Then shall
the eyes of the blind," Bunsom returns from his " snaok and short
drink," and has some difficulty in finding his seat. What his snaok
has consisted of he doesn't inform me, but, like Lesbia, he "has a

beaming eye," and there is altogether an air of snch joviality about
him a* is a safe indication of the short drink having given complete
satisfaction. He recognises me at a distance, and waves his hand.
He comes jauntily towards his seat, and says, cheerily and loudly,
"Well, old man, what's been going on?" The serious portion of the
audience in my immediate vicinity express their distaste for this sort
of interruption in a mild but deoided S-s-s-h!" So, motioning him
to his plaoe, I pretend to be completely absorbed in the performance.
But Bunsom is restless: he has his lorgnettes out at once, and is
examining the Choir.
"Some pretty girls there," he mutters, totto voce, with the air of
a slave-merchant who is going to pick out a few to take away with
him. "Doosid pretty girls, some of 'em," he goes on, adding, as he
gives me a wink, and then emphasises it with a sly nudge of his
elbow, " shouldn't mind being in that Chorus myself, eh, old man?"
I point out to him, in a whisper, that the sexes are separated.
"Yes," he says, knowingly, "but I should make a mistake, and
get on the wrong Bide, eh?" This is not the proper tone of mind
for anyone " assisting" at a Handel Festival.
During the Entr'acte we roam about the Palace and visit the Pom-
peian House and the Picture Galleries. Bunsom meets a friend, and
I hear the word " smoke " pass between them, after which they both
disappear, and Bunsom doesn't return to his seat till nearly the end
of the Second Part, when he brings with him a rich odour of tobacco.
The Chorus comes out very strong in the Second Part, specially in
"All we like Sheep," which phrase is repeated so often,—it seems
like twenty-five times, but cannot be less than a dozen,—that
Bunsom has had enough of it after the twelfth repeat, and not
being possessed of a book, he asks me "What do they mean by going
on saying that 'they all like sheep?"' He is right: it does sound
absurd, and to anyone unacquainted with the context, which, by the
way, they are a long time getting at, the effect is simply of a lot of
people announcing the fact of a not very peculiar or extraordinary
taste for mutton on their part, in the words " All we like sheep."
"Doyoui"' growls Bunsom, as if answering the Chorus. "ThenI
wish to goodness you'd get some, and have done with it."
The repetition has been too much for even the enthusiastic man
with the bald head; he has given up privately conducting, and
has fallen fast asleep. Bunsom follows his example, waking up for
Santle y's solo, and then getting on his legs for the glorious Hallelujah
Chorus, when the bald-headea enthusiast, now thoroughly roused,
beats time wildly, wags his head, and, I fancy, has considerable
difficulty in restraining himself from waving his injured hat, and
joining in lustily.
Bunsom is so deeply impressed, that only once during the Chorus
does he put his lorgnettes to his eyes, to look at the ladies in the
chorus; but this is only a matter of habit, as his face is perfectly
grave and his air as subdued as if he were in church, where for a
moment he really thinks he is, for he promptly causes the race-glasses
to disappear in their case, and Btands quite overpowered by the
sublimity of the work, and the remarkable power of its execution.
"Splendid!" I say to him, when it is finished, and we have
applauded everybody, and Mr. Manns in particular.
"Yes." returns Bunsom, meditatively; "but I'd rather hear it
in a Cathedral."
I understand the sentiment, and, to a certain extent, agree with
it. Yet there are some good people who think that an Oratorio
should be kept for the Concert Hall, and a Clergyman actually found
Scriptural authority for not playing Handel at all in the text,
"Handle not." But he was a rigid Puritan punster.
On Wednesday, the selections, with a few notable exceptions, were
not on the whole satisfactory, though admirably executed by eoloists,
chorus, and orchestra. "See the Conquering Here Comes" was
superbly rendered. The excitement was at its highest when
Augustus Dbukiolanus walked down and bowed his acknowledg-
ments. Of course to-day's performance on the organ was the Best.
Mr. Ma as sounded an alarm with telling effect.
One good thing I overheard. Mr. Manns has a way of constantly
holding his left hand to his ear. A simple-minded lady was much
exercised by this, and at last she turned to her neighbour, and asked,
"Is he deaf?" The idea of a deaf Conductor for a Handel Festival
is delicious.
The Crystal Palace Directors would do well to go in for more of
this class of entertainment. It might become the Palace's tpe~cialite.
This is a suggestion. Bunsom thinks so too.

THE LONDON SCHOOL-BOARD AND THE "SATURDAY REVIEW."
Dear Mb. Punch,—I read with shame and indignation in a weekly
journal an outrageous attack on the august body of which I am a
member. We are accused of bullying, and worrying, and fining,
and imprisoning an infinite number of the poorest of the poor for not
sending their children to school in obedience to the Act of Parliament
and the Mundella Code. This Journal presumes, with characteristic
audaoity, to set itself above all Acts of Parliament and all Codes. It
says we frequently deprive a poor family of five or six shillings a week
by taking a boy away from work and compelling him to go to school.
Well—suppose we do—what is a paltry sum of five or fix shillings
a week oompared with the inestimable advantages of such an educa-
tion as, through the liberality of the ratepayers, we are enabled to
offer to the humblest and the poorest? What are pounds, shillings,
and pence, compared with the pursuit, as the late Lord Lytton
would say, of the Beautiful and the True? The boy who, instead of
sinking to the level of a mechanic's drudge, can quote from the
prophecy of Dante or the Elegy of Gbay, is already on the road to
fortune, perhaps to fame. But it is said that we have spent £300,000,
or thereabouts, on compulsory education. If it were three millions
instead of three hundred thousand, I say the money would have been
well spent. Then it is said that we often prosecute some poor
widow, not because she does not send her boy to school, but beoause
he plays truant, thus punishing the innocent for the guilty. 0 wise
oritic! have not the innocent suffered for the guilty since the world
began P and is not the point about which there may have been some
doubt, now clearly settled by Act of Parliament?
The writer of the article even goes out of his way to eulogise
Paget, that most irrepressible of Beaks, for the obvious reason that
he invariably decides against the School-Board. The long and the
short of the matter is, that our honourable Board is held up, by
unscrupulous persons, not only as a gigantic humbug, but as an
insatiable vampire, which is steadily consuming, and threatens
finally to swallow, the vitals of the ratepayers.
You, Mr. Punch, know how utterly false and groundless these
charges are, and I appeal with confidence to your love of justice to
say a word in our behalf. Your pen is a sledge-hammer. Wield it,
I entreat you, in the cause of humanity and progress, and demolish
at a single blow the puny scribblers, who, in the depth of their
hopeless ignorance, have ventured to assail the greatest and most
glorious work of the Nineteenth Century.

A SOAP-AND-WATERLESS JULY.
(A Wee-daring Novelette.)
From the Prince Zoedoni. Caviare Hotel, London^ to the Duchesa
delta Bianessa, Marghati, near Ramsghati, Italy.
Dttckissima Rebeckah,
I ooi your letter, whioh was delightful, because it was
yours, but which made me feel like a schoolboy who had got a
vacona toppo mi baeca. Yes, it is quite true. We'are going to be
married. I met her in one of the river tea-gardens. It was at
Putney. I had never seen a woman like her before. She is so white,
so beautifully olean. I never saw anything so clean except the virgin
snow on the Anti-maccassa. She is so different to you. Felicitate
me! Write to me at my future Eden. It is oalled Welsharp, near
Eadon, Arryshire. It is the ohoice of my beautiful Soap-dish.
From the Lady Sarah Snookee, Buckingham Palace Road, London,
to Lady Chelsebut, British Embassies, Vienna and Constan-
tinople.
The season has been horribly dull—only one marriage worth
talking about. The second daughter of the Right Hon. the Earl of
Battersea Park, the Lady Jinnivere, is going to be united to Prince
Zoedoni, the Roman Toff, whose nats—three of them worn one
upon the other in full dress—are simply lovely. The Earl did
not care about it as the Lady Jinnivere had had another young man
keeping company with her—her cousin in the Blues, Lord Hampton
Court. But the Prince carried all before him—his performances on
his national musical instrument, the mouth harp, were irresistible.
From the Lady Clara Beer de Beer, London, to Miss de Rotherville,
Thames Steamboat Citizen B, off Gravesend.
The wedding was first-rate. Real Saumur champagne, ginger-pop,
oold beef, ana what I may call all the delicacies of the season. The
Chief Rabbi, who had at first refused his consent, had given it, and
behaved quite too charmingly. The Prince kept all his hats on at one
of them. They are going to Welsharp, near Endon, for a month to be
quiet. I fancy Naso will soon be bored. She ought to have taken
him to some lively place, Buch as Southend or Boolong.
From the Prince Zoedoni, Welsharp, near Endon, to the Duchesa
delta Bianessa, Marghati, near Ramsghati, Tanetta,
Duckxssima Mia,
_ _ I never saw so muoh water before I This place is a perfect
paradisio, but I seem always to be washing my face. This is a
nusanza. As for the kitchen, it is perfeotly awful—no fried fish,
no tripo, no inioni! But still I am very happy. Ma Sopanvatura
is an angel I
From the Duchesa della Bianessa, Marghati, to the Prince Zoedoni,
Welsharp, England.
Caro Mio Ciappoki,
Your wife certainly bores you. She is evidently a
nusanza. We know what our men want—a slappa sido di nodello.
I have half a mind to write to her to tell her to give you a ponciello
sulla nobba.' Poor fellow. Povero diavolo, now miserable you
must be! I know how you hate water!
From the Princess Zoedoni, to Lady BUtunche Ditchling, of the
European Embassies.
Dearest Blaunchb,
Of course, I am awfully happy, and can't be too proud of
being married to an Italian nobleman of Hebrew descent! It is
such a rise in the world for the daughter of an English Earl. Still
I do not like all his foreign habits. You see he will drink beer (he
calls it mezzo e mezzo) with the servants in the village ale-house,
and never dresses for dinner. He always wears the same flannel-
shirt. But he looks so different from our young men—suoh long
hair and so pioturesque I But I am afraid he is bored! Isn't that
dreadful f However, he seemed quitepleased the other day when I
got him some garlic! Dear fellow! He yawned afterwards, and he
sleeps a great deal. Yes. I am afraid he is bored.
From [Lady Blaunche Easiboots, of the European Embassies, to
Princess Zoedoni.
You little silly! You would marry a noble rum 'un. If he won't
make himself an advertisement for What's-his-name's soap, well
you can't wash your hands of him now. Bored is he? Then be
proud of him. He is olever. Only clever men are bored. Well-
eduoated ones are school-bored. You ask my advice? Yes. Well,
it is this, do as you like and let him do as he likes. Then you'll
both do as you both like, and you '11 both be happy. You little goose.
From the Prince Zoedoni, to the Count Maccaroni, Sutton Garden,
London.
Caro Bobbo,
Pray send me all the penny-dreadfuls, London Journals, and
"Pink 'una ' you can find. Also naif a dozen outty pipes, a pound
of shag, and a hundred.penny Pickwicks. ■ Suoh a place, caro mio!
But my wife is just a little too particular. She expect* me to brush
my hair more than onoe a day! What a nusanza! 6 boro, boro!
The fact is, we Italian Ciappis are not aooustomed to this sort of
thing!
From the Lady Sarah Snookes, Marghati, near Ramsghati, Italy, to
Lady Chelsebut, British Embassies, Vienna and Constan-
tinople.
Yes, they are both here. The Prince is constantly with the
Duchesa della Bianessa. Their danoing the other evening in the
polka-mazurka at the Aula Marina was the talk of the place.
Lord Hampton Court saw them, and carried the tale to the poor
little Princess. I met her and her rejeoted admirer going down
to the bathing-machines. They, of course, knew that near the sea
they would be safe from observation of the Prince. He would never
come there! I Bee many complications ahead. Well, they will all
be the fault of A Soap-and-Waterless July!
THE GIFT OF REPARTEE.
There are qualities, esteemed by some, to whioh I lay no claim,
But look down on them with quiet scorn, as commonplace and tame,
Such as industry, sobriety, and honesty, forsooth,
Punctuality, and accurate adherence to the truth.
I've been told by captious persons that my "form " is deuced bad,
That my language is irreverent—in fact, that I'm a Cad!
But, to balance my shortcomings, e'en my enemies agree
That kind Nature has endowed me with the Gift of Repartee.
Every day—occasion serving—I contrive to make a hit
With some dazzling inspiration of my keen and ready wit.
My impromptus are as luminous as lightning, and as hot,
Sometimes playful, sometimes withering, but always on the spot.
Yet the smartest things I utter have occasionally led
To results which made me feel that they had best been left unsaid;
For Society abounds in stupid Philistines, you see,
Quite incapable of relishing the charms of Repartee!
I've a muscular acquaintance who is always full of chaff,
And against me, 'tother evening, he contrived to raise a laugh
With a somewhat rough and vulgar kind of joke—but let that pass !—
I rejoined, with sparkling humour, " Jones, my boy, you are an ass!"
Whereupon he struck me suddenly, and just between the eyes,
With a force that caused me no Bmall pain and very great surprise.
It was then. I may admit, the notion first oocurred to me
That it might have been as well had I foregone that Repartee.
Once my venerable Aunt to reprehend me felt inclined;—
She's a Psedo-Anabaptist, of a gloomy turn of mind;—
After twenty minutes' preaching, I had had about enough,
So I wittily exclaimed, " Beloved Aunty, you 're a muff!"
The old woman—at her dulness you will be amazed, I trow—
Proved unable to appreciate that admirable mot.
She left every ounoe of property she owned away from me,
And I lost a handsome fortune by that brilliant Repartee!
I was being cross-examined in a Court of Law, one day,
When the Judge exclaimed, "Speak louder, Sir! I can't hear what
you say!
I perceived my chance, and of it straight resolved to make the most,
So I shouted, Why, old Cockywax, you're deafer than a post!"
His Lordship did not see the joke, but took me up quite short,
And, in point of fact, committed me for gross contempt of Court.
Off to gaol I went, and years elapsed before I was set free,
All because that deaf old duffer had no taste for Repartee!
I was once in love, and deeply too, with One surpassing fair,
Of romantio disposition, languid eyes, and tawny hair.
She was plump and she was pious, this inimitable One,
And she vowed she loved me dearly—but she wasn't fond of fun!
I remember, when she kissed me of her own accord one day,
I exolaimed, "I '11 tell your Mother!" in my scintillating way.
Well, she slapped my face and sent me to the right-about, for she,
Strange to say, was quite disgusted by that graceful Repartee.
This inestimable gift of mine, I candidly confess,
If appraised by itB effects, can scarcely rank as a success.
It has cost me more than competence, and liberty besides,
Not to mention countless hosts of friends and half a dozen brides.
I've been kicked with noisome frequenoy, and punched till I was sore,
Trampled on with high-heeled boots until I wallowed in my gore.
Yet, despite the thousand sorrows badinage has wrought to me,
There is nothing I'm so proud of as my Gift of Repartee!

NEW MEN AND OLD ATTITUDES.
Principals of the New Conservative Comedy Company trying to look as much as possible like the Old Public Favourites.
ESSENCE OP PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED from
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Lords, Tuesday Night, June 23.—Happening to drop
into one of the Paddington Omnibuses this afternoon, thonght I saw
familiar figure in the corner. Tall, big-shouldered man. with dark
beard, slight stoop, and small hand-bag. Can it be? Yes, it is—
the Markiss?
"Going down to Ascot?"
"No," he said, "going to Windsor; accepted oflioe, you know.
Oh no, that was all my fun declaring I wouldn't go in. Wanted to
scare a few friends, and natter myself I succeeded. You should
have seen some of them—I mention no names—when they heard that
there was a hitch. Thought, too, I'd frighten Gladstone and his
lot. But they seem to have changed their opinion. Were terribly
alarmed, at first, that we would not come in; but now don't seem
disinclined to go back. I've had a rare time this last week, Tour, I
can tell you. But no use spoiling a joke by keeping it up too long.
So now I'm oil to Windsor. Have left Desman in charge of affairs
in Lords."
So it turned out. Desman, in absence of Markiss, ran the
machine, and nearly broke it up. Wanted to throw out Seats Bill.
But was so terrified by the scowls and frowns of Cbanbrook and
others on Front Bench that he dropped his motion like hot potato.
Not to be moved, however, on next business. Has attached himself
to cause of Woman; is determined she shall have right done to her.
"You bring this Bill on in the Commons," he said to Miss
Becker, " and what happens? Nothing! /take it up in Lords, and
vou '11 Bee it '11 go through just as if it were the Seats Bill. Let
Lovely Woman keep her eye on me and I '11 pull her through."
Made magnificent and convincing speech in moving Second
Reading of the Bill. When he sat down dead silence prevailed.
House evidently taken by storm. Not a nobleman to get up and
offer reply, however weak." Denman folded his arms and surveyed
the scene with Bmile of triumph. Hope Lovely Woman was keeping
her eye upon him. for he was certainly pulling her through.
Question put from Woolsack "that Bill be read a Second Time."
"Non-Contents have it," said Lord Chancellor.
Denman looked at him with pitying glance. Going out of oflioe:
naturally in spiteful temper, but, happily, harmless.
"Contents nave it," he insisted. They strove in vain against his
determination. House divided, and, somehow or other, people got
thirty-six
the other
us other-
wise, induced him to take up our cause."
Souse of Commons.—State of lively expectation in Commons, but
nothing particular in fulfilment. Gladstone confirmed statement
privately made to me by Markiss an hour earlier. Conservatives
will take office. Writs to be moved to-morrow, and in the meantime
House adjourns.
Commons, Wednesday. — Umpires called "Over!" and field
changed sides. "You don't move, of course, Tobv," said Glad-
stone. "You're above all Parties. We poor politicians, condemned
to stand on two legs, are swayed hither and thither by the storms of
politics. You, broad-based upon four legs, remain unmoved amid
the convulsions of our little world. Ah! happy dog 1"
Much touched by this confidence. To ordinary people he seems in
highest spirits: plucked up wonderfully Bince he went out of Office.
But beneath the mask is a bleeding;heart. Very nicely put, that
about the four legs. But a man can't have everything.
Gladstone read long correspondence between the Markiss and
himself. Method of correspondence rather peculiar. Markiss wants
to say something to Gladstone, bo writes letter to the Queen at
Windsor. Queen sends it to Gladstone. Gladstone replies in
letter to the Queen, who forwards it to Markiss, and so on.
"Using Her Majesty for a pillar letter-box," says Shaw-Lefevbk,
who regards incoming of Markiss as a personal question arising just
as he was settling down comfortably at St. Martin's-le-Grand.
"Cheaper and quicker to use a penny stamp, and send letter direct
between Downing Street and Arlington Street."
"Not a very safe way either," says Chamberlain. "Evidently
one letter miscarried. On 20th Markiss repeats declaration, ' Can't
take office without specific pledges.' 21st, W. E. G. repeats refusal
to give them. On 22nd Markiss takes office. Must have been
something to round off his flat refusal of 20th."
Business done.—Rowland Winn moves writs for new Elections.
Thursday.—More new appointments and more writs. House
hears with delight that Ashmead-Bartlett is "one of Her Majesty's
Commissioners for Executing the Office of Lord High Admiral of the
United Kingdom."
"And so you've made Ashmead-Bajbtlett a sort of Lord High
Admiral," I said to the Markiss, who was hanging about the door of
the House of Lords waiting till half past four to make his entry as
Premier. "This is pretty quick advance for a man who yesterday
was rated A.B."
"Yes," said the Markiss, with a sigh. "It's been a terrible
business all through. But Beach declined to take charge of
Commons unless I gave him a specific pledge to put a stopper on
Ashmkad. 'It's a choice between him always asking questions, or
occasionally answering them,' Beach said. For peace's sake, put
him on the Treasury Bench.' Had to yield. But it's a bad prece-
dent, and will make the House of Commons unbearable. You '11 be
having now half a dozen imitation Ashmead-Bartletts, all practis-
ing ' An Easy Way to the Treasury Bench.'"
Full House in Lords. Markiss introduces himself as Premier, and
has kindly reception. Alludes to _Correspondence with Gladstone,
but makes no reference to missing letter. Hardinqk Giffard,
ouriously observed by Redesdale, partially seats himself on Wool-
sack, "Giving," says Shebbrooke, his poetic mind fired by the
spectacle, "the last touch of grace ana dignity to this gilded
chamber."
Business done.—Parliament adjourns till July Cth.

PUNCH, OR
THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"A DAY IN THE COUNTRY."
Pent in olose, unwholesome places,
Where the sun can scarcely shine,
Little children, with pale faces,
In their abject squalor pine,
'lis a spot that's fever-haunted,
Where they draw a poisoned breath;
But the Poor work on undaunted,
In that atmosphere of death.
Though the children that they cherish
Swiftly fade away and die;
Though the little babies perish,
And in nameless grave-plots lie;
Still the workers plod on grimly,
Where the thick black smoke is curl'd;
Sometimes maybe feeling dimly
There's somewhere a brighter world.
Those poor children, sad the story,
Never saw a stately tree,
Ne 'er beheld the sunset glory,
O'er the flower bespangled lea.
Never saw the starry daisies,
And the streams that wimple down;
Far the meadows' fragrant mazes
From the close courts of the Town!
They have never seen the ocean
Break in thunder on the strand,'
All the wild waves' mad commotion,
When the surge o'erleaps the land;
Never known the twilight tender,
When the storm-wind has passed by;
Or the pale moon's silver splendour,
When the sea reflects the sky.
Take them one day, then, from sorrow,
From the haunts of sin and crime,
That from gladness they may borrow
Comfort for the aftertime.
Let them see the country smiling.
Shining stream and dower-clad plain;
All their wee sad hearts beguiling
From a life so full of pain.
One small luxury untasted,
One delight in all the hours,
And the pittance won't be wasted,
Since the children see the flowers.
Sir, your button-hole has posies.
Madam, your fan too. Suppose,
You for once give up your roses,
That the Children see one rose.
CYCLOMANIA.
Chapter IV.
Afteb my spill off the "Shoreditch Zephyr," my
"Costume" is a thing of shreds and patches, and the
Machine a thing of cogs and smashes; still I feel re-
markably cool and collected.
Suddenly remember a story of a man who met with a
railway accident, and thought nothing of it at the time,
oat went raving mad exactly six hours afterwards.
A Rustic appears. He is the man who was shouting to
me at the top of the hill. He tells me there's a board
there " a-waraing of wheelers not to ride down." Well,
why didn't he shout louder? I ask him. He says he
"hollered" as loud as he could, and tries to harrow me
with a tale of a man who was thrown off a tricycle on

Am rather pleased to hear of this. Don't feel at all

the Station.

by train.
At Station.—A difficulty arises. Station-Master
objects to my machine going in Guard's Van. Says that
the Guard "isn't bound to take a lot of broken iron and
bits of india-rubber in his van."
"But I've got a trioyole tioket," I point out, indig-
nantly.

She. "And don't forget to order Six Dozen of the vert Driest
Champagne you can get, for our Dance on Tuesday nixt."
He. "But the Ladies, as a rule, don't like vert Dry Champagne."
She. "No, Love, they don't. No more do the Waiters!"
"D'you call this thing a trioycleP" Station-Master asks, with withering
sarcasm.
I wish Spbogoeb were here now to listen to the "Shoreditch Zephyr"
being abused. Station-Master retires, and leaves the matter in Porter's hands.
I leave a little matter (of a shilling) in Porter's hands. Porter thinks a truck
would be the beet thing for the machine.
As a result have to hire special truok—cost, twelve shillings. The " Shore-
ditch Zephyr" is fast becoming a very expensive and unmanageable form of
nightmare.
I have to visit Station-Master's office, and sign a paper about the "tricycle
being my own risk." So it is, so it has been.
Query—What are Spbogger and Habkaway doing now?
At Brighton Station.—Heavens I Miss Fanny and her sister have been
travelling down in the same train with me. They've caught sight of me!
And my coat is torn, my face grimy, and my hands a mass of dust and oil.
And pretty Fanny Habkaway says, as if nothing had happened, "Well, and
how have you eDjoyed your ride't"
I assure her that "nothing could have been pleasanter." I keep the stirring
tale of my accident for a more opportune moment. Then I hurry oft to see about
my machine, and promise to rejoin Clara and Fanny at the Hotel.
As it is now quite a quarter to seven, and they were due at six, having
changed my attire, I am persuading Fanny and Clara that it's no good to wait
any longer, when we hear a sound in the distance. Yes—there's no mistaking
it—it is somebody " tootling" on a trumpet; in fact, there are two trumpets, and
they seem to be tootling different tunes.
In another minute Spbogoeb and Habkaway are seen dashing along on
their machines. They are dusty, hot, tired, fearfully thirsty, but apparently in
excellent spirits.
"Never had such a splendid spin," they both shout, as soon as they catch
sight of us.
Spbogoeb addresses me as "old stick-in-the-mud!" I believe he's been
drinking. Ask him. significantly, if he has dined anywhere.
"Wheelmen don't dine I " says Spboggeb, scornfully; "took a lot of fuel on

board at Horsham." Habkaway adds something about " stunning
champagne at Horsham."
I try to tell them about my accident . Spboggeb says no time to
listen now—must hurry on to Brighton. So they mount again, and
are off with another wild burst of tootling. Surely Fanny and
Clara will think this "bad Dragonfly form." _ No; they don't.
Never mind. I shall have a chance of harrowing them all this
evening with account of my terrible accident.
In the evening, after dinner, try to interest Fanny Habkaway in
a conversation on politics. She is polite, but inattentive. Prefers
the shoppy talk on trioyoling whioh Spboggeb and Habkaway are
keeping up, and whioh is something as follows:—
Sprogger. "What a glorious bit that was down-hill after Cuck-
field! *
Harkmcay. "Splendid! Mile in two and three-quarters. Beats
Lowndes's record time by a second."
Sprogger. "Lowndes got a nasty spill at Lillie Bridge."
HarLway. "Riding for the N. C. U.?"
Sprogger. "No; riding for the A. A. A."
Wonder Habkaway, as a barrister, isn't ashamed of himself.
Wonder what Habkaway's clients (if he has any) would think of
him if they could see and hear him now.
Why not tell 'em about my spill now? I will. I tell it, but,
somehow, it seems ineffective. In fact, having told it. I don't think
much of it myself. Instead of harrowing them up, I 'vo made light
of it as a mere nothing. Quite surprised at my own view of it.
Naturally Spboggeb thinks lightly of my danger, but wants to
know what has become of the "Zephyr." He seems quite offended
when I tell him it 'a smashed, as if he had a kind of interest in it,
simply because he recommended me to buy it.
"Didn't you fall underneath?" he asks, severely.
I tell him that, as far as I recall the circumstances, I flew over the
handle. Habkaway laughs unfeelingly, and oalls it "going
Circuit;" but Spboggeb is still grnmpy, and says,—
"Then if the ' Zephyr' fell on you, as you assert, that ought to
have broken her fall."
This is what Trioyoling brings a man to I Spboggeb regards me
simply in the light of a useful Buffer, to "break the fall" of a
Machine when it topples over!
Fanny Habkaway proposes a " nice little moonlight spin " with her
on her " Tandem Sociable," whioh she and Claba rides between them.
I've never ridden a " Tandem" in my life! Fanny Habkaway
sees my hesitation, and suggests that "perhaps 1 'rn a little shaken
after my fall."
Fall 1 Fancy calling an aooident like mine a fall! No—not so
much after as at the time. But it's my own fault for not harrowing
their feelings, and telling my own story badly. No, I '11 show
Fanny Habkaway what a hero I am. and will ride the "Tandem"
with her. I tell her so. She says. All right," and, when we've
got the Machine ready, she gracefully mounts on a seat in front!
Query—How on earth am I to climb up into the seat behind, which
is about a yard higher?
Scramble up by a tremendous effort! Miss Habkaway says,
"Are you ready f as if she was starting us for a raoe. No, I oer-
tainly am not ready. What a fool I am to be riding a Tricycle
again after such an accident as mine!
I have to steer, too! We start off, and at once run against a lamp-
post Fannt Habkaway indignant. Asks me why I didn't put on
the break? I tell her I don't know where the break is on this inf
on this sort of machine. She points it out, and asks me to be more
careful. Under any other conditions, a moonlight ride alone with
Fanny Habkaway would be romantic, but it isn't romantic now.
We are going along a little better. Why am I so nervous P Am
afraid of every cart that passes, and nearly go into ditch to get out
of their way. What frightful shadows the moon does cast r Hor-
rible to have a lady riding in front, especially a lady you care for,
whose safety depends on your skill in steering. Can't work the pedals
properly. Another minute, and I'm sure I shall fall off.
Miss Habkaway asks me to stop. I do so willingly. She dis-
mounts, and then remarks, "Aren't your hands trembling P"
I don't know. I smile feebly, and say,
"No, I don't think so." {Query—Am I really "very much
shaken " after my fall P)
"Beoause "—says pretty Fanny Habkaway—" I really think I
would rather ride alone until you've mastered the 'Tandem1 a
little more."
This is cruel of Miss Habkaway. I tell her that I've been nearly
killed in my terrible aocident this morning (I think "terrible
accident" sounds well, and will impress her) and I am not fit for any
further exertions.
She agrees with me, and I despondently wheel the creature back to
the hotel. So ends my first (and last) day's " spin to Brighton."
'Home, Sweet Home."—Yes, by all means—only it must be sweet.

'A Dann come to judgment!" Shaka-
pearian Colloquial Vertion.
WARFARE AT ISLINGTON.
(A Visit to the Military Tournament.)
"Dbeamtng of Angels "—at Islington—we decided that the Mili-
tary Tournament was a thing to be seen. It was well worth seeing.
A great success, and decidedly
so. If we oould always go to
war to such light-hearted
tunes as the Band was con-
stantly playing, war would be
only a pleasant kind of outing.
But that's not the tune that
John Bull has to go to war
to; and those are not the notes
he has to "pull out." But
this was not the frame of mind
in whioh anyone visits the
Agricultural Hall.
The "Cavalry Displays"
were most interesting; the
"Musical Ride" as good as
ever; and the Boy Bugler on
his bare-backed steed was one
of the great sensations of the
week's show. But the per-
formances are, one and all, too
long; the enormous and
tightly - packed audience, on
Thursday for example, became
very weary about five o'clock,
and numbers cleared out,
partly owing to the programme
not being arranged so as to be
intelligible to the meanest
capacity, and partly to their
unwillingness to sit out the interminable lance-and-sword contests,
a couple of which would suffice as far as the Public is conoerned.
On this occasion the Lemon-outting, Tent-pegging, and several
other exhibitions of skill, were judiciously omitted, Captain Dann
seeing it was just on half-past five, when the Entertainments had to
be wound up by what we, who had oarefully studied the Programme,
were all looking forward to seeing, i.e. the "oombined display of
Artillery, Engineers, and Infantry," in scaling an obstacle, cover-
ing the construction of a bridge by playing the guns on the enemy,
then the crossing of the Artillery over the newly-built bridge, and
the storming of the Fortress, from whioh were driven the Military
Band, whioh, under the direction of Mr. Dan Godfbey, might have
made a gallant music-stand, and blown out their assailants' brains
with their Trombones, Ophioleides, Bassoons, and other air-guns or
wind instruments. The scaling was done with marvellous rapidity
by the Infantry, who were up and over the wall as if half a dozen
mad bulls were after them.
The Quadrille might be out out with advantage, as it is too sug-
gestive of the professional Circus, and, subsequently, the absence of
the Clown is calculated to create a feeling of disappointment. And
then what is the use of cavalry able to dance quadrilles on horseback,
if the enemy won't join them r
Each Show—and there were two to-day—ought not to last for more
than two hours and a half—from 2 "30 to 5, and 7 30 to 10, whioh
would be quite enough for all reasonable people. They must have
taken over eight thousand pounds on the week, and oertainly it is
one of the most popular entertainments of the Season.
As for Captain Dann, who is shouting all day, even if he belonged
to infantry he must be a hoarse soldier by the end of the week; but
as he is one of the Judges, how on the two last days he can have a
voice in the matter at all is wonderful. He ought to be rewarded
for lung service.
We had expected an oration from the temporary Secretary of War,
at Islington, who bears the classio name of Tully, but Captain
Mabcus Tullius was too busy for talking. There was plenty of
material for Eikebo among the horses if they hadn't been so well
trained and thoroughly in hand. Mr. Punch congratulates the
Committee on the results of this year's Military Tournament.

at the very
least to the
Lord Chancellok upon a collection of miscellaneous subjects by
one's friends. I should perhaps limit the friends to those who are
laymen, as those who belong to the profession are less anxious to
obtain one's opinion, no doubt from feelings of jealousy, or even
envy. Amongst my law-loving acquaintances, Fogwell used to
be the most urgent in his appeals to my judgment. One day he
called upon me at my Chambers as usual "bothered out of his
life." 1 was not always pleased at his visits, as he had a way with
him of smoking cigarettes and asking awkward questions about the
number and nature of my Briefs. At first I hoped that he might be
accepted by my fellow tenants in oommon as a Solicitor anxious for
my advice, but he soon dispelled that illusion by asking anyone who
happened to come in the same question of law he had pat to me, and
then if the reply was different to the answer I had given (whioh was
generally the case), used to turn round upon me with the ungrateful
exclamation, "There! I thought you must be wrong!"
"Yes," he said, after a preliminary apology for knocking down
my wig-box and disclosing its contents—some cheap toys for the
boys at home—"I am almost dead. The matter of the sale of the
land has got into Chambers, and I know that Coke, Stephens and
Bacon, will make a mess of it."
"Messrs. Coke, Stephens and Bacon are most respeotable and
able practitioners," I replied, in a tone which was intended to
impress him with the idea that I had known them intimately for
years, and was their favourite and most trusted Counsel.
"Of course, I know that," he answered, testily; "but, as you are
aware, in Chancery most matters, when in Chambers, are entrusted
to a Clerk, and Coke, Stephens and Bacon can't be everywhere at
once. What I am afraid of is, that they will hand over the matter
to one of their Clerks, who doesn't know the facts of the case."
""What are the facts of the case?" I asked. I always like to
keep my hand in, and to tell the truth, I do not receive a visit from a
Solicit or, at times, for hours together.
"Well, it is something like this," he returned, "I don't quite
know myself exactly how it goes, but you as a Barrister will be able
to pick it up at a glance."
I bowed at this compliment to my professional ability.
"I am a tenant for life of a portion of the property, when it can
be realised," he began, and I again nodded, to intimate that so far
all seemed to me plain sailing, and the real Plaintiff is one of the
Defendants, as the nominal Plaintiff is in reality a Defendant, because
you see he has a divided interest in the freehold as a joint trustee
for some of the remaindermen who have mortgaged their share under a
pre-nuptial settlement, whioh, however, will be divided under a hodge-
podge clause in the will of the testator. That's simple enough."
Again I nodded, but this time rather more perfunctorily.
"1 thought you would think so," he replied, Beemingly much
relieved; but the difficulty is, so far as I oan make it out. that the
copyholds are, by the particular custom of the manor, not barred in
dower, and, consequently, are on a different footin? to the property
held in Kent under a Borough Enplit-h tenure. Well, somehow on
account of this there has been a clashing of interests, and the result
is that we have had eight separate sets of 8olioitoT8 hard at work at
it for the last five years. I suppose it couldn't be helped—could itP"
And he looked at me inquiringly.
"My dear friend," I replied, "if you are represented (as you say
you are) by Messrs. Coke, Stephens and Bacon, you could not pos-
sibly be in better hands."
"Yes, I know," he replied, mournfully, "but there is a summons
in Chambers before the Chief Clerk to-morrow about a right of way,
or the purchase of a wheelbarrow, or the insnrance of a haystack, or
something or other connected either with the freeholds or the copy-
holds, and I do wish you would look in and watch it."
Rather against my will, as I thought I possibly might be recog-
nised as a Member of the Bar (the contingency, I admit, was a little
remote, as I have more to do with Common Law than Chancery), I
consented, and the next morning wended my way to the chambers of
the Chief Clerk of Mr. Justice Chttson. After passing two lounging
custodians dressed in a garb something between the joint uniforms
of a Commissionnaire, a private in the Army Medical Department, a
Custom-House searoher, and a "ohucker-out" of an East End
Musio-Hall, I ascended several flights of stone steps, passed along
about a quarter of a mile of dimly-lighted corridors, and entered a
large room which was divided into two parts by a line of demarcation
marked out by a barricade of screens, folding-up washhand-stands,
and office-desks. In front of the barricade was a orowd of solicitors
clerks, varying in age from fifteen to fifty, and behind it was a stolid
but albeit amiable-looking gentleman of the highest respectability.
This latter I ascertained was the Chief Clerk. With his long Aus-
trian moustache, had I met him at a county ball I should have put
him down at once as the Captain Commandant of a local troop of
Yeomanry Cavalry.
"Are you all here P" he asked, making notes in a MS. book with
white paper covers. Upon this, about a dozen gentlemen, in various
costumes, ranging from the billyoook-hat and tweed-suit of dittos of
the country to the regulation chimney-potand unexceptional broadcloth
of Rotten Row, replied in the affirmative. "No change of Solicitors
or appearances in person this time Y" he continued, as if anxious to
avoid mistakes. Again the combined answer was in the affirmative.
"Well," he said, leaning back in his arm-chair, "what is it?"
Immediately an extremely intelligent youth of very tender years
(I do not think he could have been much older than fifteen)
began one of the most impassioned harangues to which it has ever
been my pleasure to listen. I was fairly astonished at the flow of
eloquenoe. the erudition, the powerful inveotive of this forensio
infant. His words came with a rush resembling a verbal Niagara,
and it caused me real pain to observe that the other representatives
of parties interested instead of listening, as I did, with respectful
awe, merely smiled scornfully or nodded in derision. I felt so
indignant that I took up my place beside him, and whenever he
paused fur breath, as he did every five or ten minutes, I bowed my
approval. At first he seemed inclined to treat my silent gesture of
approbation as a covert insult, but soon seeing how earnest was my
commendation, he accepted me as an ally, and constituted me the
Chief Clerk's assessor, addressing his remarks equally to both of us.
I was flattered at this deference, and renewed my noiseless applause
with increased fervour.
"That may be!" at last said the Chief Clerk (who, I fancy, I
regret to say, if appearances were to be oredited, may have been
dozing) when he could get in a word edgeways; "but that does not
account satisfactorily for the fact that when I ordered affidavits in
support to be tiled within three days, exactly two months and a fort-
night has been consumed in thinking about it."
Again Niagara began to flow, amidst a renewed accompaniment of
partly suppressed derision. Once more I afforded the eloquent and
persecuted youth my hearty but silent approbation. He proved, up to
the hilt, that it was totally impossible to have filed the affidavits at an
earlier date, and that, as to the future, they could not, under any cir-
cumstances whatever, be obtained for at least another seven weeks.
"Very well," said the Chief Clerk, at last, "I will look over the
matter this time; but mind, you must have them all sworn and filed
by the first thing to-morrow morning."
"Thank you, Sir," replied the now triumphant infant, smiling
joyfully. There were a few mild and ineffectual protests from the
others, and the matter ended.
I must confess I was a little astonished at this abrupt termination
to the proceedings, the more especially as I felt convinced from the
arguments that had been used by my learned boy and brother that
the affidavits could not possibly be obtained in the absurdly short
time specified. I mentioned my doubts to a gentleman of solemn
appearance, who had taken no active part in the discussion.
Sir," he replied, "I have yet to learn what you have to do with
this affair; but if vou are not connected with the firm represented
by Mr. ScoRBr, I think it my duty, in the interests of my Client, to
protest against your unprovoked interference."
"8ir," I answered, angrily, "I am here nurely as a friend of Mr.
Fogweix, and am very much surprised at so unoalled-for an
observation."
"And I am surprised, Sir, excessively surprised, Sir, that you,
claiming friendship with Mr. Fogweix, should have given your
entirely superfluous countenance to one of his opponents.
"Opponents!" I exclaimed. "What do you mean. Sir P"
"I mean, Sir. that I am the representative of Messrs. Coke,
Stephens and Bacon—very much at your service !" and he left the
room.
I do not know what the representative of Messrs. Coke, Stephens
and Bacon subsequently told Fogweix about me, but it is certainly
a fact that from that day to this the oldest of my friends has
deliberately out me! A. Briefless, Junior.

THE REAL WATTS.
(A Biographical Disillusion.)
It has been discovered, and demonstrated, that the real Byron,
and the real Shelley, differed very greatly from the Byron and the
Shelley of popular imagination—the ideal B. and S. So likewise
did the real differ from the ideal Watts.
Dr. Watts, in his peculiar line, stands unrivalled amongst English
Poets. His poetry, besides its moral excellence, is distinguished by
a simplicity more sublime even than that of the glorious Three-per-
Cents.
The great Dr. Watts has been hitherto reputed, with due allow-
ance for his era, as, in his life and conversation, a purely angelic and
seraphio dootor. Hem! Was he P
Born at Southampton, of Dissenting parents, Watts accordingly
received the Biblical name of Isaac. As Shaesfeabe has been
styled the " divine Williams," so Watts, the rather as having been
a distinguished Dissenting Divine, might be styled the "divine
Isaacs." His name, Isaac, was by his youthful associates subse-
quently, reduced to I key; a diminutive suitable to his physical
dimensions.
He was not only very short, but also remarkably thin and meagre,
as a statue erected to him a few years ago in an open space at South-
ampton represents him, attired in his habit as he lectured: a flowing
curly wig, a gown, bands, and knee-breeches—an admirable work of
comic art.
In childhood sent to a preparatory school (kept by the Rev. Mr.
Ichabod Increase) he displayed a marvellous aptitude at the acqui-
sition of knowledge. But, like most very olever boys, he was unde-
niably what our forefathers used to call a " pickle." One hot day,
when his master had fallen asleep in his chair, young Watts, having
procured a piece of white foolscap, of which he caused one end to
onrl by a manipulation with a paper-knife, pinned the other end to
the top of his preceptor's collar, behind. With a view to curry favour
with the pedagogue, one of Isaac's school fellows " split" upon him,
and Watts, who though slight of frame was spirited, after school-
hours punched his head.
He was so quick at learning all his lessons that he had plenty of
time to read for amusement, and he devoted most of his leisure to
the biography of Buccaneert and Highwaymen. Though fond as any
of his playmates of youthful pastimes, being scarcely strong enough
to compete with them at the athletic sports of cricket and football,
he addicted himself principally to marbles. He was also greatly
given to "pitch and toss."
Young Watts was passionately fond of birds'-nesting, in the
pursuit of which he used often to repair during the holidays to
Shirley Common, in his time a wilderness. A reminiscence of this
early reoreation may be deteoted in the touching line,—
"Birds in their little nests agree."
When he became a Bomewhat bigger boy, he betook himself to
angling, and for that purpose would frequently repair to Wood Mill,
at the mouth of the Itchen, where he once hooked a salmon so large
that it pulled him into the water, and he was with great difficulty
rescued from drowning by some rustics, haymaking in an adjacent
meadow.
He took a peculiar delight in dog-fighting and cock-fighting,
though he considered that the former beat the latter. He justified
this predilection by alleging the pugnacious instinct of those animals,
an argument he afterwards reproduced in the verses commencing
with—
"Let dogs delight to bark and bite,"
for which permission he assigned a reason logically unanswerable,
as also for conoeding the same liberty to bears and lions:—
"For 'tis their nature to."
Which, whatever modern critics may say, was obviously the
original reading. The child was the father of the man, and after
Aberdeen and Glasgow had created him a Doctor of Divinity, Watts
would often, during his extended residence at Abney Park, discourse
eloquently upon his sporting experiences, as he reclined in his arm-
chair behind a long pipe, with a tumbler of rum-and-water before
him, hot, strong, and sweet.
This was "The Real Watts." Those who are now aware of it,
know What's Watts.

A MERRY MEETING AT THE ROYAL INSTITUTION, ALBEMARLE STREET.
A RECTIFICATION.
In our account of the Military Tournament last week we said that
the Band was conducted by Mr. Dan Godfrey. This was wrong.
Dan should have been Charles. Charles writes to us to say that,
in effect, "he's Dan'd if he'll be mistaken for his brother, who
conducts the Grenadier Ouards' Band, while he (Charles) con-
ducts the Band of the Royal Horse Guards, whioh played the whole
week at the Tournament Show, Islington." The other Mr. Godfrey,
the Dramatist, might write a piece, in one fraternal Act, on purpose
for Mr. Das to appear in, and call it the Danny Chef. Of course there
would be a part in it for Charles, his friend. Here's to the health
of the two gallant Conductors, and may the time be far distant—
though it is oommon time for all—when they will say,—
"Music'« the food of lore! Give o'er, give o'er,
For we will baton on that food no more."

St. Swithin shall earn my best benison;
For when from long drought the green turf is all Browning,
It is not so nice to play Tennis-on.
Old Times Revived.—Bath is again becoming quite a fashionable
resort. At the end of the London Season, wearied Doctors who used
to send their patients to foreign water-cures are now saying, "Oh,
go to Bath!" In the course of time Jericho will have its turn.

Scene—An Official Antechamber. Hangers-on, Supporters, and
general Outsiders in attendance on a newly-constituted Govern-
ment discovered in the best spirits awaiting the announcement of
another and still later " batch " of Subordinate Appointments. A
few distinguished Placemen looking on gloomily in the fore-

asleep. Enter a Private Seoretary with a list. As he comes
down, an ugly rush is made at him, but he clears his way good-
humouredly, and suddenly slapping the sleeping Former First
Lord of the Admiralty on the shoulder, wakes him up, amidst
roars of laughter.

THE NIGHTINGALE AND THE DRUM.
A Nightingale sat piping on a spray,
At the soft closing of a day in summer,
When loud belabouring there passed that way
An idle Drummer.
His rattling rub-a-dub the fluting drowned.
"Pooh!" cried the Drum, "you tootlers are not in it.
I whelm you with the volume of my sound
In half a minute.
"I'm grand, sonorous, eyolio! T "But here
The Drummer halted at the " Rose and Thistle,"
And shouted for a tankard of small beer,
To wet his whistle.
The Drum was mum, the bird piped softly on.
"0 Drum, when thumped you deem the welkin's greeting you,
But all your borrowed blatancy is gone
When one stops beating you!"
Moral.
In spite of loud acclaim and long self-praise,
Tested by Time's unerring equipoise,
A little rill of melody outstays
Niagaras of noise!
"STEADY, SIR, STEADY!1
Mr. Punch originates but never imitates. Were he inclined to do
so, he might authorise his Prime Minister to follow the lead of the
Editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, who, last Saturday, warned the
public against perusing its next four numbers on acoount of the
"infernal narrative " whioh they would contain. Did Mr. Punch
wish to extend his world-wide circulation, he would be inclined to
advertise thus:—
NOTICE TO OUR READERS
A Frank Warning.
We have determined to publish the most diabolically sensational
story that was ever written or read. Compared with it the friskiest
and riskiest of French novels is a dry study, and the most thrilling of
English romances an ordinary record of everyday life. The illustra-
tions will be scarifying! Therefore we say quite plainly to all who love
a genuine story of passionate love, hideous revolting crimes, and the
most cruel revenge, that they will do well not to look into Mr. Punch's
next two nnmbers, in which the tearful narrative ot unparalleled
atrocities, of the mn«t abominable facts, with real names of persona
and places, will be completed.
But no,—world-wide circulation is sufficient for Mr. Punch, and
though of oourse he could such a tale unfold, yet, he never will,—
wishing to remain, not a respecter of persons, nor a respecter of
Mr. Podsnap's "young person,"—but simply a respeoter of himself.
By'the time this appears, the Pall Mall Gazette will have made our
flesh creep, and of oourse the rush for the paper will have been
enormous. Perhaps the end, which the P. M. G. keeps stead-ily in
view, may justify the means.
"One in the Ete."—Mr. Ashmead-Bartlett, whose asperity
even victory does not seem to soften, celebrated his success at
Eye by calling Mr. Gladstone a "curse." The defeated Liberals
console themselves with the belief that at the General Election this
particular " curse" (though by no means a chicken) will again " come
home " to rule the Parliamentary " roost."
A FUNNY MAN.

My friend, M'Coloquint of Perth,
Whose leading Christian name
is H icks,
Although the kindest soulon earth,
Is over-fond of playing tricks.
At school he frequently got licked
For filling ink-pots up with
bran;
And has, since then, been some-
times kicked—
You see, he's such a Funny
Man!
One day his aged Maiden Aunt
(From whom he expectations
had)
He made the victim of a " plant,"
Which very nearly drove her
mad.
Whilst she was in a placid doze,
Her cheeks he painted black-
and-tan,
And gilt her venerable nose.
Now, is he not a Funny Man?
As he can swim like any whale,
It is his favourite diversion
To take his friends out for a sail
And treat them to a cold im-
mersion.
To save them, as they splash
around,
Is part of his facetious plan;
Of course they now and then get
drowned.
What then? He's such
Funny Man!
I've sometimes found it hard to
bear
And harder still to blandly grin
When—asked by him to take a
chair—
I've sate down on a lengthy pin
This jest he specially affects
And vows that no one surely can
Dispute its comical effects.—
He's such a truly Funny Man!
A Bishop wrote to him to say
He'd call on him next day at
noon
About a Mission, on its way
To christen blacks at the Gaboon.
Hicks hid himself behind the door
And, with a massive warming-
pan,
Laid out the Bishop on the floor.—
He is, indeed, a Funny Man!
There's naught M'Coloquint
enjoys
More heartily than Boxing
Nights-
Its red-hot pokers, thieving boys,
And buttered slides are his
delight.
You'd scarce believe how many
jokes
He '11 praotise with a water-can,
A squirt, oranythingthat soaks.—
He is a deuced Funny Man!
He's never happier than when
Inventing some astute device
To terrify his fellow men;—
Such as explosive cards and
dice,
A detonating 'bacca-hox,
Or elegant electric fan,
Inflicting truly painful shocks.—
He's such a very Funny Man!
And thus with harmless, kindly
jest
He brightens life for many a
one,
Who, but for him, would be op-
prest
With oare, and quite forlorn of
fun.
He wrote his epitaph one day
In waggish mood; it thus
began—
"Hie facet—Hicks, I meant to
say—
Dead, as alive, a Funny Man!"

To patter of—when not aboard,
But hands upon the helm, like mine,

A Steersman's choice ain't very wide,
Must have an eye to wind and tide.
Oh yes, we slated t'other crew;
Why, when a Cap'n's ont o' work
What better has he got to do P
Will was a f ambler and a shirk.
We told yon so, my mates and me,
And now—well, we 're on board, you see!
Oh, we 're all right, we '11 keep her straight,
But as to altering of her course,
That's sudden. You will have to wait.
Eh? What P Feel something like remorse
At chewying the old Cap'n so?
Lor', that's sea-fashion, don't you know P
Why, even he, for all his gab
Couldn't get clear o' Ben's old tack.
It ain't like driving of a cab
Or handling of an old Park haok.
A chap who's got to steer your yacht
In these here seas must know what's what.
Gab's gab, but steering's steering. Yes,
I stilt maintain Will was a swab,
And landed you in many a mess.
I hope we '11 make a smarter job,
Eh, Randolph? He ain't got no doubt,
But even he won't "go about."
That is, not yet. We will with joy,
When tide shall slack, and wind shall veer.
Lor' bless yer, a loblolly boy
Can tell old hands how not to steer,
But when it comes to stowing patter.
And steering, that's another matter I
Look at the sky, still thick and black!
The wind, too, still at nor'-nor-'east!
When we can make another tack
I've no objection, not the least.
But whilst that wind holds with such force,
Must keep on pretty much this course.
A Clerical Query.—At the Canterbury
Diocesan Conference Lord Cbanbrook, speak-
ing of Cathedrals, recommended "that the
cathedral bodies should send out preachers to
isolated Clergymen; a course," he said," which
would have an awakening effect in the
diocese." One isolated Clergyman, letting
another preach to him, cannot be very wide
awake to begin with; but he would be
thoroughly roused before the preacher got to
the second head, when probably the sufferer
would punch the first nead he got hold of.
Sermons, however, specially on a hot Sunday
afternoon, are not calculated to have an
"awakening effect" on the lay hearers. Our
experience, we admit, is limited.
Sir John Everett Mtt.lais, Bart., R. A.,
keeps the dignity because he can support
it. Mr. Watts found it insupportable, and
it was "declined with thanks." But J. E.
Mtt.t.atb is a Millais-onaire.
THE PASTOKAL PLAYERS.
The last of Society's crazes,
When gardens in Summer are gay,
Is dancing about 'mid the daisies
And acting a pastoral play.
Though costumes archaic by Godwin
All feminine charms must eclipse;
The characters old and so odd win
Applause e'en from Royalty's lips.
The scene to the playgoer strange is,
You enter no elegant halls,
No longer your eagle eye ranges
O'er boxes, and circle, and stalls.
But here is a beautiful garden,
Before us green turf is unrolled,
As fair as the Forest of Arden,
Where Rosalind wandered of old.
A magical scene !—and so still is
The wood, that no wonder we view
Wild Cloe and fair Amaryllis,
And shepherds all eager to woo.
And here's Lady Archibald aoting
One Perigot, certes with skill,
While other parts not too exacting
Fair ladies efficiently fill.
If " Pastoral Players " go touring,
They '11 act upon each village green,
Applause of each rustic securing
For pictures they've ne'er before seen.
They'll play through the bright Summer
weather,
No shepherd shall single remain;
And since they are birds of one feather
Each shepherdess conquers her swain I

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WOLFF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING.
[Uncle Remus''s Latest.)
[The London Correspondent of the Matin telegraphs to that paper the report of a short conversation he had with Sir Hhnrt Drummond-Wolpf.
In this the English Commissioner declared that he had not as yet had a final interview with Lord Salisbury on the subject of his coming journey.
Sir H. D. Wolff added that neither he nor the Government had any preconceived ideas on the subject. His mission would, above all, be to keep on
the best terms with the representatives of the other European Powers in Cairo, and to endeavour to find with them a solution of the present conflict.
The problem, according to Sir H. D. Wolff, is not so difficult if goodwill be shown all round. Asked whether the statement that France had asked for a
proximate date for the evacuation of Egypt, with a pledge given by herself not to occupy Egypt or to allow any other Power to do so, Sir H. D. Wolff
replied that he was ignorant of any such demand or pledge, but that he was convinced that Lord Salisbury would treat the question with justice and
moderation, and with due regard to the susceptibilities of other Powers.—Standard.']

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER.
If there's nnn thing as I likes more than another its wariety, and
I thinks I am hound in honner to say as I gits plenty on it. On
Munday I seed Bitch a scene as I never seed afore, and oan scarcely
hope never to see again. Fancy his Royal Hiness the Prince of
■Whales, and her Royal and Dutiful Hiness the Princess of the same,
and amost all the Royal Famerly, cumming to Guildhall to see the
yoothful Prince—who ewery boddy calls by a different name, but
who I dins means to call Eddard, coz it was King Eddard of
"memmery as foundered blooming BillinBgit, the pride of"
's Art, but this buy the buy—go through what
probberbly be the most importentest ewent of his long rain, wen it
comes, which may it be a long wile off! namely taking up his free-
dom in the Grate City! Ah, that was summut like a site, that was.
I wunce did good Mr. Hovkrall, the Liberaryan, a little service
in gitting him a nice plate of clear turtel wen he was jest about dun
up with ard work, so he kindly managed to squeedge me into the
butiful Libery jest before the royal party cum. So I seed it all.
The fust thing as struck me was the startlin fack, that as a King
Eddard made the fust and noblest of all Fish Markets, and the
Prince of Whales natrally took a interest in it, as his honnerd name
wood suggest, so his yoothful Son and Hair insisted on being made a
Fishmonger afore he was made a Cittizen. But lor that wasn't all
that was necessary to be dun, Prince or no Prince. The Lord Mare
is that partickler in all these most himportant matters, that before
he wood allow the yuthful but Royal Eddard to swear loyelty to
him as King of the City by the name and titel of Fowler the 2nd, he
demanded to know, who knowed as he was wot he said he was f
This must ha bin a awful moment in the life of the young Fish-
munger! But he need not have bin alarmed. There was no less
than four blooming Common Counselmen all clothed in butiful blew
dresses, as boldly stood forth, ony jest a leetle pail with their awful
responserbillyty, and boldly said as they knowed him to be of good
fame and reppytashun, and that he was the reel son of his Father
and Mother f Ah! to see the butiful quiet smile of that prowd and
butiful mother was summat to remember, even after dinner, and as
for the Prince of Whales he reelly larfed as if he thort it was a
cappital joke.
Then the same four bold oounselmen, to show as how they was in
reel ernest, ought to have shouted out "and so say all of us," but
they were that nervous that they all made a mistake and sed " and
so we all say "! witch I shood call quite a new wersion of a werry
old chorus.
Well, then follered one of the werry commiolest seens as I hever
seed. Whether the Lord Mare knowd as I was in a grate urry and
wanted to be off to Chingferd to wait on the Plummers company, of
coarse I don't no, but I don't suppose as noboddy hever seed a mag-
niffisent spread for about 900 Princes and Princesses and other immi-
ment swells, polished off at sitoh express speed as that 'ere one was.
Why, the hole copious Maynew and all the warious toasteses, and all
the gratefool ansers to 'em, was all got through in about a hour!
Didn't sum of the reglar old uns jest grumbel at wot won on 'em
called this most onnaturel aste, and a reg'lar waist of good wittles?
Some of the lady wisiters was grately disappinted, for d'reoly the
royal famerly left the All, about harf a duzzen pleaoemen marched
in and stood gard over the Royal Table. So there was no oppertunity
for them to show their gushing Loyalty by warking off with the
flours and the frute as Royalty had left. I dessay the Copperashun
knos best, but, tho' I'm only a humbel Waiter, I carn't help saying
as that anythink in the natur of urry is quite out of sorts with reel
Royalty, and no more agrees with it than Shampane agrees with
Turtel Soop.
So much for Munday, Royalty and urry and grumbling. But on
Wensday, down at the Inwentorys, I asisted at a werry diffrent
scene. There wasn't no Royalty U> be sure, but there was Nobilerty
and there was Hart, and there was Literytoor, and there was Beauty
to give Phillips to the wits—one on 'em sed as the ladies was like the
new Cabs, all Hansoms and no Growlers—and as helligant a maynu
as the most fastidgeous Alderman could reqwire. There wasn't no
urry there, quite the contrary, for the wit was so keen, and the fun
and charf was bo jolly, and the eloomenated fountings and trees and
gardings was so evenly, that all the werry full drest and ansom and
appy compenny lingerd and lingerd on till they was amost looked in.
I couldn't quite make out wot it was all about, but I think it was a
kind of hexperyment jest to see if a partickler nice set of peeple
couldn't dine together pretty cumferabel without no Tostes and no
speaches!
It was, of course, a werry bold atempt to make, and required a
man with the ordassity of a Nite Templer to do it, but he did it, and
it's sucksess may make a nearer in the istory of Dining. I'm
natrally myself werry much awerse to all change in this most
important of all hearthly matters, wun never nose where it's to stop.
I wunce herd of a hawful idea to employ nun but dum waiters! so
that they couldn't hear not nothink as was sed, but it never came to
nothink. But most suttenly, to my simple natur, dinner without no
Toast seems about as unnateral as Tea without no Shrimps, witoh I
suppose as all will allow, is a depth of diggeradation difficult to
conseeve. Rorert.
"O Temporal"
Told fibs two years ago P Why, that '* no crime!
Cries Randolph, "I shan't think of an apology."
Consistency's a mere affair of time.
And Conscience just a question of Chronology;
But surely Truth, to meet new Obligations,
Requires a new Statute of Limitations'.

ESSENCE OP PARLIAMENT.
IXTRACTBD FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, July Gth.—Parliament met
to-day after recess for Ministerial re-elections. Everybody but
Wilfrid Lawson in high good hu mour. Wilfrid not been home
very long, but long enough to discover he can't trust the new
Government. Bo gives notice of a Vote which, if carried, would turn
them out.
"You weren't particularly fond of the last Government," I said
to him.
"Precisely. But that only shows how entirely free I am from
prejudice."
In the Lords, the Markiss deferential and conciliatory. Appeals,
with tear in his eye, to Lord Kimberlfy to bear witness that he
never meant to postpone Dissolution. Kimberley bears witness
accordingly. Carnarvon, the new Irish Lord-Lieutenant, announces
Government don't intend to renew Coercion Bill.
"I say, Ashbourne," said Lord Castletown, addressing a gen-
tleman with white hair, ruddy face, and readv smile, "isn't this a
little odd? Seems uncommonly like as if the Markiss was going to
adopt policy advocated by Chamberlain and Dilee and found too
strong for the Liberals. But that can't be. You'd never stand
that."
"Why not?" said the new Peer, with look of bland inquiry.
"Why, I've heard you in the other House hint at awful things if
Gladstone let the Coercion Act lapse."
"Pooh, pooh 1 dear boy, you are discussing two entirely different
persons. That was Edward Gibson you are talking about, and you
are talking to Lord Ashbourne."
The McCullum More watched with sardonic smile interchange of
courtesies between the two Front Benches. General disposition to
slide over circumstances attending ohange of Ministry; desire to
make things comfortable all round.
"That's all very well for to-night," said The McCullum More,
AN INVITATION.
(Imitatedfrom, and commended to, the "St. James's Gazette.")
Come, then! and, if you can,
Forget the Grand Old Man,
His craft, his cunning, and his casuist tricks,
Whioh he calls politics:
Forego, if but awhile, the bonds and rules
With whioh Dame Party fools
The smartest scribes in Town,
Making them play the clown.
He, for the moment, does not stop the way,
So let us have a little frank fair play.
The Tories, glad and hale,
In Office now prevail;
Young men as Ministers are bursting out;
Lies still are blown about
By raging Rads inspired by Party spite,
And Jingoes, fierce for fight.
But, bless us! Summer s fair,
Roses blush everywhere;
Why keep up a perpetual fizz and frown?
Come! turn it up, and let the Old Man alone!
Since Randolph, smart and young,
Rules, backed by Land and Bung,
How can we come to any special harm?
Has chivalry no charm?
Eternal nagging, like fool Bottom's roar,
Beoomes an awful bore.
A truce to shrieks and squeals I
Poor spirit it reveals
To spout perpetual Party Fi-fo-fum.
Leave that to duffers; try good temper I Come!
Mn. Punch's hearty congratulations to Sir Nathaniel
de Rothschild, who, last Thursday, made his appear-
anoe as the first Jewish Peer of the Realm in the House
of Lords. It is on record that he looked particularly
neat, quite "natty," in fact. As, according to the vene-
rable ancient rite, he took the oath oovered, his Lord-
ship might, had he chosen to change his name, have
assumed the style and title of Lord Hatton.
Most Appropriate.—The real Member for Eye should
be Mr. Crttchett.
"but on Friday I '11 tee if 1 can't make things more lively."
Accordingly, gave notice to " call attention to circumstances attend-
ing change of Administration."
In Commons, Bradlaugh appeared, positively for the last time in
the history of this Parliament. Affair decorously dull.
"If the House is coming down to this," said Sergeant-at-Arms
pulling off pearl-grey gloves, "sooner it's dead and buried the
better. Here I have been practising the waltz Bttp this morning
with the thermometer at eighty in the shade, bought new gloves, put
on best pumps, and Bkadlaugh walks up and down the House like
ordinary Christian!"
Good deal of speech-making, interspersed with little promenading
by Bradl4ugh. But whole affair very tame. Attorney-General
made maiden speech. Great hit was his allusion to Hardinge
Giffard as "keeper of CIueen's conscience." Pretty to see Web-
ster's look of astonishment when House laughed. Hadn't meant
to make a joke, and hasn't yet seen it.
Business done.—Thirty-four Votes in Committee of Supply. One
notice of Vote of Censure.
Tuesday.—Most affecting scene to-night; scaroely a dry eye on
the crowded benches. Gladstone been talking in kind and gracious
manner about new Ministry; Randolph, with voice trembling with
emotion, throws himself on Old Man's breast, and discloses his long-
dissembled love.
"Most consid-sid-siderate," he says, through his sobs. "Most
mag-mag-magnumimous."
Some people had hinted suspicion that Gladstone would act
otherwise. But not Lord Randolph. It was not for him to obtrude
his notions upon the House. He had, indeed, in times past, success-
fully concealed them. But now the flood-gates had burst, natural
emotion would have its flow, and Youth and Age were locked in
fond embraoe. Jesse Callings didn't get over the speotacle for
long time. Three hours later, rising to speak on some other question,
he addressed the astonished Speaker as Mr. Mayor."
In course of speeoh Randolph, much against will, touched on
contentious matter—could not close his eyes to historical faot that,
in 1833, when Tory Party passed Coercion Bill, Gladstone was a

member of the Party. Overpowering argument this, as bearing on
question at issue. Gladstone obliged to note it; so, smiling benig- j
nantly on his young friend on other side of the table, he observed,
"I was then twenty-three years of age."
"Only twenty-three!" said Randolph, with note of admiration
in his voioe at this fresh and striking testimony to Gladstone's
versatility. "Yes, but so remarkable is the genius of the Right
Honourable Gentleman, that it would not be extraordinary if, at the
age of twenty-three, he had dominated the Tory Party."
Beautiful all this. Tempting to linger over. Almost as touching
as the deprecation by Sir Michael Beach of desire on part of Tories
for Coercion Bills in Ireland. . "We do not propose," he said just
now, "to renew any of the provisions of the Crimes Act, because we
object to exceptional legislation of this character; " and he wondered
why. when he was so grave, the House should go into paroxysms of
laughter.
Business done.—Government secure for public business remaining

sea raffled Jonoe by lynx-eyed Labby, who wanted to
know.why, when there is only one Queen, there should
be five Rival Yaohts.
"Wouldn't mind an additional yacht or so," said the
Sage of Queen Anne's Gate, "if only they were used.
But here's a yacht oost £200,000 to begin with, £56,000
spent in repairs last year, £3,000 more wanted this year.
Wages going on regularly, and yaoht scaroely ever out
of harbour."
Rather strong ease this on face of it. But suppose it's
all right since Labbt got only thirty-seven Members
to follow him, 128 supporting the Vote.
Another ripple about Hob art Pasha. "A political
agitator in this oountry on behalf of the Turkish Govern-
ment," cried Sir George Campbell. "Who put him on
the half-pay list P"
"Not I, said Lord Geobqe Hamilton. "Only just
come in. Must ask late Government."
"Not I," says Caine. "Don't know the party."
Nevertheless, here's the Vote. Committee not with
out suspioion that Hobart Pasha may have already
pouched a quarter's salary or so. Evident bewilderment.
Happy Thought—Ask Gladstone. Gladstone not
present, so inquiry relegated to Report stage.
Business done.—Navy Estimates completed.
Thursday.—No doubt about Georole Hamilton's
courage. Has frequently faced Gladstone, and has
now, at few moments' notice, taken command of the
British Fleet. "Not that I would have done it without
assistance," he modestly says. "Bargained for that with
Markiss when appointment offered. 'Give me a thoroughly
good man as Civil Lord, and I'll go anywhere and do
anything.' 'Who '11 you have?' says the Markiss.
'Ashmead-Bartlbtt,' says I. 'H'm 1' Bays the Markiss.
'I wanted Ashmead myself at the Foreign Office, or, if I
could make up my mind to spare him, would have given
him to the Colonies, or the War Office, or the Home Office.
In fact, he's one of those men that will do equally well
anywhere.' 'Ashmead-Bartlett, or I don't go to the
Admiralty,' I insisted. 'Very well,' said the Markiss,
'if it must be, it must be.' So it was settled."
"But what's the matter now," I ask. "Hefs not
going to leave you, is he P"
"No, it's not that. It's Lennox," said Lord George,
nervously tearing a pieoe of paper off his copy of the
Orders, and laboriously folding, refolding, measuring,
and shaping it. "Was to have been here yesterday to
discuss Navy Estimates. Couldn't come. Bound to be
here to-day. You know he declared the other day
before passionate public meeting at Pendleton-in-the-
Pond, that as he had attacked Naval Administration of
the late Government, he would not spare us. Means what
he says too. Terrible fellow when ne starts. Here he
comes, and with trousers turned [up! Bad sign that."
And Lord George nervously tore up bit of paper he'd
just formed into perfect square.
"Don't be too hard on them, Henry," I whispered in
Lennox's ear. '\They 're young in offioe yet."
"Well, since you intercede, Toby," he said, with little
ourtsey, "I'll let 'em off easy. But must teach them
my eye's upon them."
Pretty mild after all, but nothing to what he might
have been. "I'm pledged to the English people, Toby,"
he said afterwards, " and I '11 keep my bond at whatever
oost to personal feeling. I told them at Pendleton-in-
the-Pond to rely upon (me to keep the Navy straight.
They are relying, and they shall not be disappointed."
Ana Henry smote his manly chest, took in another reef
on his starboard trouser, and flashed on trembling First
Lord of Admiralty an eye that gleamed like a binnacle
light. _
Business done.—Beach brings in Budget.
Friday Night.—" What's that ?" I ask the Markiss,
as a sound of melody floated through the Corridors lead-
ing to the House of Lords.
"Oh, it's only The McCullcm More, coming down
to make a speech. Old privilege of the Argylls, you
know, that they may enter Debate preceded by the
Family Piper. Here he comes!"
Sure enough he did, the Piper first playing "The
Campbells are Coming," then The McCullum More,
with head thrown back, " Pride in his port, and orange
bitters in his sherry," said Rosebery, little thinking
what was in store for him. Three times they circulated
the Benches, the Piper finally halting at second Benoh

tremendous whirl of Pipes, began.
Prodigious speech. Everybody wrong, especially Rosebery. Late Govern-
ment hopeless; present Government doubtful. Dismiss everybody, and leave
everything to The McCullum More. After this magnificent oration, everybody
struck dumb—everybody but Rosebery, who, young and audacious, actually
chaffed his High and Mightiness!
Business done.—Duke of Argyll thoroughly enjoys himself for hour and

IN THE TEMPLE GARDENS.
Where blossomed red roses and white on the shores of the swift-sliding Thames,
Whioh no traffic of Trade had then stained, where the wrangling Lancastrian
railed,
And the cheeks of the cholerio Yorkist flushed ruddy with hatred's hot flames,
On many a crimson-dyed battle-plain doomed to be death-blanched and paled;
Where revels and feastings and pageants of times when the Tudor sat high,
Have long given plaoe to the pacing's and ploddings of students-at-law,
There now, on a soft summer eve, under Babylon's blue-dappled sky,
For once driven clear of foul reek as the wind-winnowea heights o'er Looh
Awe;
A sight may be seen whioh would startle the Tudor, and move with amaze
The rose-badged Plantagenet ruffler. The roses, alas I are now rare;
Their red will not freely unfurl amidst London's mephitio grey haze,
Their white cannot snowily spread in the City's dull smoke-laden air.
Yet green grows the grass as of old, and now, footing it featly, you '11 find,
Not dryads or nymphs, nay, nor even fine ladies from mansion or Court,
But scantly shod street waifs of London, pale mites, frowsy-clad, but with mind
Full set on the madness of frolic, absorbed in the rapture of sport.
Scarce Lazarus stretched in the shade of Shedad's eastern Eden might look
Much stranger than London's small Arabs at play in this learned retreat,
This cloister of seoular black-robed recluses and slaves of the book,
Whose verdurous hush is unbroken by sounds from the wheel-harassed street.
The rap of the racquet here echoes, the flash of the fast-flying ball
Gleams white o'er the green of the turf. With the sound and the sight there
are blent
The laugh of the ragged young romp, and the street urchin's cockneyish caB,
The vision of foot-weary slum-dwellers sprawling in restful content.
Polished mook-Pastoral Players, who pose 'midst the woodlands of Coombe,
Less gladly inhale the bland air than these frowsy-clad thralls of the Town,
Who tumble and soamper and whoop where the spindly geraniums bloom,
And the plane trees and limes of mid-London at mid-summer shrivel and
brown.
The town-children's small rus in urbe! There toddlers impatiently wait,
There ten-year-old nurses, o'erburdened with animate bundles, abide
Expecting the olook's Open Sesame / when through the big iron gate
The band may break over the turf in an eager tumultuous tide.
"Please, Sir. what time is it now t" So the faint childish treble appeals,
And out of a wan face the wide wistful eyes look up into your own;
And, in spite of the tatters and grime, what a flush of warm sympathy steals
To the heart of the well-to-do watcher, if haply that heart is not stone.
No Arcadian prim picturesqueness; the brush of a Callot might find
Fit theme in these tatterdemalions, grubby, grotesque, and unkempt;
Yet here is far wholesomer stuff for the brooding prophetical mind,
Than much which the artist has pictured, than much whioh the bardling has
dreamt.
Sir Joshua's roseate cherubs, the muslin-clad modish child-swells
Of Millais and Sant are thin visions compared with yon pallid-faced mite;
But her soiled ootton-print hangs in loops, in the purlieus of Drury she dwells,
And to her the trim Temple parterres are an all-too-brief dream of delight.
Shout, scamper, and squabble, poor waifs, though the eye of the dainty may turn,
And the ear of the sensitive shrink, at the dust and the din of your sport.
Let shallow-souled sentiment gush of child-dwellers by brooklet or burn;
Thoughts deeper, if sterner, are stirred by these throngs from the grey City
court.
Red roses and white of old times did less graoe to these gardens, be sure,
Than the urchin-troop, towzled and loud, that now whoop by the waters of
Thames;
And our Templars to-day do far better in giving glad hours to the poor,
Than though flashing in front of the fight for the making of glorious:
"Look Here !"—A Book for the Rail is the second title of this amusing
brochure, whioh would certainly be abbreviated by an Irishman into a Bale
Book. Full of good temper, although the Author admits to being Searley.

Season Correspondence,
which is entirely at its

The Vicarage,
Thumpyng-on-the-Braine.
July 21, 1885.
Sir, — The remarkable
and really wonderful dis-
plays of instinct, as de-
scribed in the entertaining
letters of your various
Correspondents who have
for the last fortnight des-
canted at length on the
more hidden life of the
Common Domestic Blue-
bottle, impel me, as an enthusiastic cultivator of strange pets, to
relate my own most recent, and perhaps most curious, experience
—namely, that of the habits of a full-grown Central African Hippo-
potamus.
One having been sent to me some years since when quite young, anony-
mously in a horse-box, 1 had kept the creature in a substantial barn
on my own premises, and brought it up, so to speak, "in the house,"
feeding it at intervals myself through a grating with a pitchfork, till
at length it grew so tame that it would take a sack of Potatoes from
my hand. That these quiet but much maligned creatures have been
set down as lacking in intelligence, is well Known; but I oan only
testify from my own praotical experience that the charge has no
foundation. As a case in point, I can vouch for the faot that, on one
occasion, forgetting to let my knowing African friend out for his
little matutinal scamper about my lawn—a privilege I always
allowed him—he at once baoked out bodily through the outer wall of
his rustio, but strongly-built prison-house, carrying away with him
fifteen square yards of solid masonry, with chains, bolts, bars, and
half the roof in accomplishing his exploit, finally walking in at my
study window covered with brick-dust, only to go through the floor
instantly, with a heavy crash, into the wine-cellar beneath, much to
my surprise.
After this interesting occurrence, strangely enough we were in the
habit of finding all our ououmber frames frequently destroyed as
utterly as if some vindictive person had orushed them purposely with
a steam-roller. At first I dismissed in turn several of my gardeners,
but the strange annoyance continuing notwithstanding, I made up
my mind—for the frames had been repaired, indeed, 1 might say
entirely renewed, thirteen times at a very great outlay—to watch for
myself. I had not long to wait. Scarcely had the lights been put
out, but I noticed my mischief-loving friend quietly walking round
the corner, and approaching the frames. Taking a preliminary roll
over a bed of varied geraniums as if to stretch his legs, I saw him
deliberately near the end frame, and then, as if enjoying the pastime,
roll head-over-heels backwards and forwards several times across the
seventy-five feet of handsome glass wood-work and prize vegetables,
and after the whole was little better than a flattened pulp, quietly
retire as if refreshed by his experience.
I am inclined to think that he regarded the glassy surface pre-
sented to his view as the nearest approach to the Nile to be found in
the neighbourhood; and though I nave since parted with my old
favourite to the proprietor of a travelling menagerie, who took him off
my hands with a bonus, I am even now, when I think of them, struck
with the various signs of really active intelligence he displayed before

The Phenomenal C.ub, nth July, 1885.
Sib,—I can, in every respeot, confirm your Correspondent's inte-
resting account of the astuteness and intelligence of the much abused
Hippopotamus. The manner in whioh he will bring a grand piano
down-stairs, I have heard, is this. Lying on his back, he clasps the
instrument tightly with his hind and fore legs, and, descending
backwards, slides down each flight, carrying away a few banisters at
each turn, the master of the house, who is generally holding his tail
in an effort to stop him, acting as a useful drag. Anybody who has
stayed several months in a country mansion, where one of these
clever and lively creatures is kept loose, will confirm what I say.
But it is when three or four of them oombine that the most re-
markable results follow. Then I have known the whole contents of
three upper storeys, together with the staircase itself, brought com-
pletely down into the hall in a single afternoon. Though it is yet
the month of July, and Parliament is still sitting, feeling that no
apology is due to your readers for supplying them with this quaint
and timely information, I beg to subscribe myself,
Almost an Eye-Witness.
POETS COKNERED.
The Annual Meeting of the " Wordsworth Society," held the other
night at Rutland Gate under the indefatigable presidency of Lord
Houghton, though an evidence of much prevalent intellectual
activity, at the same time discloses some curious facts about poet-
worship hitherto possibly not suspected by the outside and uninitiated
public To judge from the briefly reported account of the proceed-
ings, [it would appear that for genius to have an [enthusiastic fol-
lowing is not such a very enviable fate, after all. After one or two
playful all-round hits in his best style, the noble Chairman, proceed-
ing to deal with the special idol of the evening, commences what
might he fairly termed his masterly attack on him, by expressing his
inability to understand why when he (the speaker) was a Cambridge
Undergraduate, Wobdswobth excited, as he undoubtedly did for a
brief season, any enthusiasm whatever. With this regular back-
hander to set off with, the noble critic finds, apparently, no difficulty
in following on with more in the same line. There was, he says, no
reason, as far as he could see, why anybody should have laboured to
elevate either the poet's name or his works; and he adds, almost
dolefully, further down, not only that " the extreme familiarity " of
the Great Master's diction had in it something uncongenial to the
literary minds of every period, but that that fatal artistic defect was,
moreover, "accompanied by something that looked like vulgarity of
thought.'5
After this regular pail of cold water delivered at his reputation, it
would have been reasonable to suppose that the unoffending Author
of " We are Seven" might have been mercifully dismissed. But
no,—Lord Houghton had still something still more stinging in
reserve to say about him.
Once more harping subacidly on the Great Master's "extreme
familiarity of diction," he moreover maintains that the sentiments
whioh it represented "were of a very ordinary character" (sic),
and " unassociated with any of those stirring, deep and passionate
emotions with which Burns was saturated. And looking Dack," he
continues, as if to give the selected idol of the evening a sort of
finishing settler, " I think we feel that more strongly from that one
great deficiency of the faculties of Wordsworth—total want of
sense of humour. No man with a sense of humour could have
exposed himself to those occasionally just criticisms of the almost
comic positions of some of his characters."
After this there really does not seem room for much more to be
said, though it is only fair to the distinguished lecturer to add, that
he concluded this severe and scathing criticism with the candid
admission, amid much laughter, that if asked to name in a Lady's
Album the greatest poem in the English language, he should un-
hesitatingly set down " The Ode on the Intimations of Immortality."
Notwithstanding, however, this tardy compliment, it is evidently no
joke for a poet to have an evening to himself at Rutland Gate. We do
not clearly recall what its accomplished owner made of Gray and
Colf.kidge, but we would strongly advise him, if he contemplates
the immediate worship of any living genius, not to deliver his
panegyrio before submitting the rough draft to a respectable Solicitor
well up in the law of libel.
The Ban-Orofters' Bill.
Next Saturday Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft bid farewell to manage-
ment. As wise as they are clever. Most women have their one
chance ef marriage offered them in the course of their lives; and
most managers have their one chance offered them of retiring with a
fortune. Bankrupt or Bancroft P, " that is the question"—and
they have shown in this step, as in nearly every other, their good
judgment. Mr. Punch throws the old shoe after them for luck, and
wishes them a thorough enjoyment of their well-earned repose.
Eton f. Harrow.—Such a lot of 'eatin' at Lord's. The Boys
were not pupils, but apparently all crammers. Glad to see that the
Etonian Gosling acted up to his name, made twenty-three, and so
didn't come out with a " duck's egg." All Cricketers mustjbe Con-
servatives, as they would never vote for abolishing Lord's.

HOW BRER RABBIT LOST HIS FIHE BUSHY TAIL, AND HOW
BRER FOX COT INTO SERIOUS BUSINESS.
{Untie Bemus up to Date.)
"Attkr Gran' Ole Man Rabbit lost his long: bushy tail," began
Uncle Remus, and then he paused suggestively.
"How did he loae it f" asked the little boy, curiously. This was
just what the old man expected, and he responded readily.
"Wy some fokes sez one way en some fokes anudder. Dey ain't
sorter 'greed on dis yer pint nohow, dey ain't. Dat tail foller Gran'
Ole Man Rabbit fer years, des like it wuz his shudder. His enne-

The little boy looked sorrowful. "Poor Brer Rabbit!" he began,
when the old nigger interrupted him.
"Don't you grieve after Brer Rabbit. He ain't smashed yit, en
w'at's mo', honey, he ain't gwineter. But w'at I lay out fer ter tell
yer wuz, that after Gran' Ole Man Rabbit lose de fine bushyness en

"And did they do better than Brer Rabbit P " asked the little boy.
"De place wh&rbouta you spill de grease

chaunted the old nigger, with a cunning smile on his ancient
countenance. "I notices," he continued, "dat dem fokes w'at

NOTES BY NIBBS.
{To see the Great Pink Pearl at the Prince's.)
I HAD heard suoh a favourable report of the Oreat Pink Pearl
after its first exhibition at some matinee, that I anticipated a real
treat, as probably did the majority of the audience, at the Prince's
Theatre last Monday week.
It may be that the Pearl in
question was, on the first
occasion, placed before a
jury of appreciative oysters,
and that, on this second
occasion, it was thrown
before undiscri minat ing por-
kers,—quorum pan magna
fai,—as certainly there were
a number of grunters
present who expressed
themselves dissatisfied with
the evening performance
of Messrs. Carton and
Raleigh's "farcical phv
Had this been its fi
representation, I should
have delayed any remarks
upon it until I had seen it
again; as, take what piece
you will, whether speaking
as Hard Nibbs, Soft Nibbs,
or Medium Nibbs, I assert,
for the hundredth time, that,
after only seeing its first
ition, it is almost impossible for anyone to pronounce such
a criticism upon it as shall be of any use to the Author, Actors, or
the public. The primary end and aim of all true criticism should be
the special benefit of the Artist, and the general improvement of the
Art, whatever it may be. To convert what should be a critical
article into a mere journalistic paragraph of the day's news, or to
turn it into a convenient vehicle for airing personal opinions, is an
abuse of criticism. Critics honestly found fault with The Private
Secretary, and when, in consequence, Author and Actors at once
went to work to re-rehearse, to exoise, and to make a piece, which
had so muoh good stuff in it, what it ought to have been at first,
they showed a just appreciation of criticism, and have largely
profited by their sagacity.
If the Great Pink 'uns, Messrs. Cakton, Raleigh & Co., will do
likewise, there may yet be a good chance for what they have described
as their u farcical play," which, as now played, has iust so much
farce in it as prevents it from being a serious play, and. just so muoh
serious drama in it as prevents it from being a farce. The Actors

appeared as if uncertain how to render it. Were they to be con-
scious of its extravagance, or ignore it? Were Fenianism, revolvers,
detectives. Russian police-spies, and a box of dynamite to be impressed
on the audience as terrible realities, or as mere farcical absurdities P
Such situations as are genuinely comic were thoroughly enjoyed by
the audience who came to laugh, and who, on this account, resented
the introduction of melodramatic intensity which considerably
perplexed them.
It is, therefore, a difficult matter to criticise the acting. It may be
exactly what the Authors wished it. If so, the result is unfortunate.
If it is not what the Authors intended, then the sooner the acting of
the two principal personages is reformed altogether, the better for
the chances of the piece. The key to what must puzzle any audience
is to be found in the performance of Mr. Groves as the Fenian con-
spirator, Gormani. His acting is as highly coloured as his face;
and if this is contrary to the Authors' meaning, then his art is as false
as his palpable wig and whiskers. Either the entire piece ought to
be, by every one concerned, played down to Mr. Geoves's broadly
burlesque impersonation of the Gormani, or played up to the true
comedy level on which even M. Mahius, excellent as he is in this,
does not consistently remain. Sometimes it seemed to flash across
M. Martus in the midst of a most serious situation, that, after all,
they were "only purtendin'," and that he was in a farcical sort of
Criterion piece, and bound to raise a laugh. Were the roles of
Sheen and Gormani played by Messrs. Garden and Groves as are
all the other parts, with yet some intensity added even to these,
the piece, I think, would achieve a distinct and peculiar success. As
it is—that is, when I saw it—it was perplexing and irritating. If
Mr. Groves has influenced the Authors and Actors, against their
better judgment, to accept his view of the play, then he must be the
Groves of Blarney personified; but if his rendering of the character
is according to the Authors' instructions, then on their heads be it.
The party of the name of Garden—a most refreshing suggestion of
the Garden Party—works painfully hard as Anthony Sheen, but is en-
tirely un-f unny. He does indeed merit the description applied to him
by M. Marius, the calm Russian Diplomats—we've had a small family
of these characters since Baron Stein, in Dora,—when the latter says
several times, "These people have
no repose,"—and from this point
of view the Garden Party touring
in Paris—his voyage en Sheen—may
be taken as correctly interpreting
his Authors' meaning.
M. Mahius has the funniest line
in the piece to say when he shouts
out to a German Count, who has
never uttered more than one syl-
lable at a time, "Silence, Chat-
terbox!" which brought down the
house, and woke us all up. This
German Count, called Serge—
perhaps because he is dressed in
broadcloth—is capitally played by
Mr. Denison; Mr. Caferey, too,
as the Russian Seoret Police Agent,
cannot be bettered. This actor may
not have power to sustain a leading
part, but he certainly has a special
talent for" a bit of oharacter." But
how many, who might possibly
have been great Aotors, have been
captivated by an easy success in
"a bit of oharacter."
As far as appearance goes, Miss
Cohpton, whose acting has vastly
improved since last I saw her, is almost an ideal type of the Russian,
or, if not Russian, at all events of the Polish—or highly Polish'd—
Countess; but she drops her voice when she should raise it, and, on
this particular night, she so dropped it at the end of her best speech,
as to risk the loss of the point which could have been legitimately
made. This may have been an accident; but so it was.
The mise-en-scene is very good, and the attention to suoh details
as the French Police episode in the Second Act, points to the hand of
Monsieur Marius as Stage Manager of the show.
The piece owes nothing to any foreign source, the Authors having
got it all out of their own heads.
Mr. Savile Clarke and the other Clarke " John S." have had
new pieces at the Strand Theatre, Sarah B. has appeared triumphantly
as Theodora at the Gaiety, there is The O'Dora at Toole's, and, in

NO MEMORY FOR FACES.
For mnemonic exercises I've an inborn predilection,
Being gifted with the faculty of vivid recollection.
I remember fervid eulogies pronounced upon my charms
As I sweetly crowed and gurgled, lying in my nurse's arms:
I can quote the longest monologues e'er written by the Bard,
And can reel you off hexameters and sapphios by the yard;
I've the liveliest remembrance of events and names and places
And of dates, despite their dulness,—but I can't remember faces!
That I cannot keep in mind the diff'rent shades of eyes and hair,
Or distinguish grim old maids from merry school-girls, young and
fair;
That I never know my Father when I meet him in the street.
But mistake him for some Alderman or Chaplain to the Fleet;
That my intimate acquaintances unrecognised I pass,
And am puzzled by my own face when I see it in the glass,
Seems incredible, no doubt; but 'tis the gospel truth, I vow!
It has got me, you may fancy, into many a fearful row.
At a dinner-party once I had to sit, as chance befel,
'Twixt two men who shook my hand and seemed to know me very
well,—
They were pleasant, chatty fellows, and I soon found out, indeed,
That on Politics, Keligion, and the Drama they agreed.
But imagine my confusion when they murmured, sweet and low,
"Introduce us! That's a man I should extremely like to know."
For my answer in each ease I had to blush, as it was this :—
"I should really be too happy,—but I don't know who he is I"
I was strolling down the Strand, and musing on the Missing Link,
When a rascal snatched my watch-chain, and was off, as quick as
wink.
I pursued him for some minutes at considerable speed,
And had very nearly caught him; but my nose began to bleed.
When I met him next (as I believe) he looked a perfect swell,
And was lounging on the door-step of a mansion in Pall Mall.
I laid hold of him with promptitude—a cmirse that cost me dear—
For he proved, to my discomfiture, a pugilistic Peer!
I'm acquainted with a worthy old Colonial Bishop, whom
I regret to say I've frequently mistaken for his groom.
As they really don't resemble one another in the least,
I feel sure that he considers me an idiotio beast.
So, I have no doubt at all, do many other friends of mine
In the legal, or the naval, or the military line,
Whom, alas! I have offended—quite unwittingly, I trow—
By addressing them as people whom they didn't even know!
I've mistaken pious Countesses for Ladies of the Ballet,
Archtcologists for publicans, a Statesman for hi? valet;
I've upset the equanimity of once unruffled lives
By jast "mixing up" my dearest friends, and, what was worse,
their wives.
I went up, the other day, to an intolerable bore,
Whom I afterwards discovered I had never seen before,
And insisted upon asking him to dinner. Need I say
That he's stuck to me like putty ever since that dreadful day!
With keen agony, from day to day, I ask myself anew
To remove this disability what is it I can do?
I have studied physiognomy and every plastio art.
And I've stared at people's features till I've learnt them off by
heart.
And, cod found it! my experiments have all been made in vain,
For I ne'er can recollect to whom the faces appertain;
Yet they haunt me, and I know them, in the visions of the night,—
But throughout my waking hours I can never get them right!
I am gravitating fast towards a chasm of despair,
My annoyances are greater than I possibly can bear;—
I would try the hermit dodge, and see my fellow-men no more,
Were it not that life-long solitude is such a horrid bore.
If I thought it wouldn't hurt, I would my own quietus make
With a bodkin, or a bullet, or a slice of poisoned cake;
For my cup of life is brimming full of sorrows and disgraces,
All resulting from the faot that—I've no memory for faoes!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
I APPEAR IN A VOLUNTEER CA8E.
he first time I met my friend
Bunder was at a gathering
of the members of his own
corps, when he was intro-
duced to those present by
his then Commanding
Officer as that C. O.'s suc-
cessor. From the tone of
the gunners (it was a
Volunteer Artillery Regi-
ment) I feared that he
would experience some
difficulty in maintaining
discipline. It was not so
much the solemn silence
in which his name was
received as the open deri-
sion with which his speech
of thanks was greeted that
made me adopt this opi-
nion. The retiring Com-
mandant explained to me
subsequently that he won-
dered "thev" (the men)
"stood it, as when all was said and done, Bunder did not know his
right hand from his left." This (from a military point of view)
appeared to be a very grave misdemeanor. From the statement of
the Commandant, it seemed that he himself had not found his proud
position as Officer Commanding an exaot equivalent to a bed of
roses. He had been put to very great expense, and ultimately
resigned because the three batteries of whioh his corps was composed
insisted upon marching abreast down Piccadilly, so that they might
hear the band with equal distinctness.
"Captain Butoee!" said my excellent and admirable Clerk,
ushering in my warlike acquaintance. I was a little annoyed that
Portington had not given me notice of the soldier's approach, as at
the moment I was engaged in the not very professional practice of
trying to teach my wife's dog (a black poodle) how to Dalanoe a
bisouit on his nose until he was told that it had been duly purchased.
This was all the more embarrassing as I had always given Bunder
to understand that I devoted my entire time in Chambers to the
consideration of intricate points of law.
Left alone, on the retirement of Portington and the poodle, the
Captain opened his heart to me freely, and told me that he had been
worried out of his life by his gunners, headed by Sergeant Smith
and Bombardier Brown. Instead of "falling in" at the word of
command, his men, headed by the said subordinates, or rather insub-
ordinates, had insisted upon holding meetings, at which he (their
Captain) had been denounced in no measured terms; and that when
he nad mildly retaliated by dismissing the ringleaders individually
in a regimental order published in a local paper, had been threatened
with five distinct aotions for libel.
"So, seeing your name outside," he conoluded, " and remembering
that you said you were a Barrister or something, I thought I would
just step in and aBk you what I had better do."
I pondered for several moments, while I tried to remember as
manyprovisions as I could of the Mutiny Act. • ■
"Were you before an enemy," at length I answered, "I am of
opinion that you might order them to suffer death or any less punish-
ment that might be awarded by a general Court-Martial."
"Well, we are not before an enemy," retorted Bunder, angrily,
"and so far from my ordering them anything, I am hanged if they
haven't summoned me! They nave applied that I should be compelled
to discover a certain dummy gun, when I have never even seen it!"
"Well, my dear friend," I replied, with hesitation, "you see I
have had very little to do with criminal work, and therefore am
rather out of my element."
This innocent remark seemed to add fuel to the fire, and Bunder
became angrier than ever. However my dulcet tones, and apologetic
if not abject manner, at length had their effect, and my visitor at
last told me his sorrows in detail, and I promised to appear for him
in the police-court on the morrow.
When I reached Bowlborough Street the next day, I found the
Captain seated in full regimentals (which, no doubt, had secured him
the consideration from the Usher) on the Bench. I subsequently
ascertained that he had "sported his uniform" with a view to
favourably impressing the presiding Magistrate. If this were his
obieot, he signally failed in attaining it, as Mr. Bang, the worthy
official in question, when he arrived (as he did in a very great hurry,
as if he had just five minutes to get through his work and catch an
express train), immediately ordered him down.
I see, Sir," cried his Worship, angrily, "that you are here
making away with Her
Majesty's
Your proper place is the Dock, Sir,—not the Bench I"
charged with concealing
property. Your proper pi
Upon which the until-now-obsequious Usher suddenly changed
his tone, and unceremoniously hustled my client into the space
beyond the Clerk's desk.
I protest "began poor Bunder.
"Does anyone appear for you?" asked his Worship, snappishly.
"Dear me! has the man lost his voice? Does anyone appear for
him?"
"I do," I replied, firmly.
"Who are you, Sir?" snapped out the Magistrate, as if rehears in?
Burnand and Sullivan's excellent Operetta Cox and Box.
I felt very much inclined to continue the duet by'saying, "What's
that to you, Sir?" when his Worship went on, excitedly,
"Do you belong to a firm, or are you in practice on your own
account r"
"I am not a Solicitor, Sir, as you appear to imagine "I began.
"Then what have you to do here, Sir?" interrupted the Magis-
trate, with increased fury. "Not a word, Sir, or I will have you
turned out!"
"I am a Barrister, Sir," I exolaimed, in the tone adopted by the
hero of the old melodramas, when, throwing off a cloak, he was wont
to appear in a profusion of foreign decorations, as the long-lost and
rightful heir.
Instead of Mr. Band going down upon his knee, and exclaiming,
"My liege!" he merely requested me, with impatient courtesy, "to
fit into my proper place then," adding, lotto voce, " that he supposed
was instructed by somebody."
I was then ushered into a long pew on the right of the Bench.
"And now that's over," continued his Worship, "what is it?"
Immediately two garrulous persons sprang to their feet.
"One at a time. Pat that man into the box, and swear him."
And one of the speakers was seized, hustled into a compartment,
handed a book, and told to kiss it, whilst an official galloped through
the form prescribed by law.
"And now what have you got to say ?" asked Mr. Bang, leaning
back in his armchair, and glaring at the witness through his
spectaoles with a ferocity whioh was perfectly appalling.
Sergeant Smith (for it was he) had a great deal to say. Every
now and again he was savagely interrupted by his Worship, who
asked some question or other. 1 confess I was so upset by the hurry
and scurry of the whole affair that I could hear nothing. The only
thing that pleased me was the fact that Mr. Bang occasionally
looked at me when I bowed graciously, feeling most grateful for his
recognition.
"Have you anything to ask the witness?" asked Mr. Bang, when
the Sergeant had come to a full stop. I feebly shook my head and
weakly smiled.
"Swear the next witness," snapped out the Magistrate.
"But i" want to ask him something," began Captain Bunder,
excitedly.
"Can't," cried his Worship. "You 're represented by Counsel 1
And now, Bombardier Brown, what do you know about it?"
Again the examination of witnesses went on. Again I was too
flurried to follow the thread of the testimony, again I gratefully
bowed whenever the Magistrate looked at me. Once more I had no
questions ready.
"I will be heard!" shouted the infuriated Bunder at this point.
"Can't," repeated the Magistrate. "You're represented by
Counsel."
■ - " But I won't be represented by Counsel or anyone else," cried the
angry soldier. "I prefer to appear in person. Why, whenever you
appealed to him," he continued, indignantly pointing at me, "he
decided against me!"
"He did!" returned the Magistrate, shortly; "but that's his
business and not mine 1"
"But it is mine!" almost yelled Bunder. "I repudiate him!"
Mr. Bang looked at me. Of course there was only one thing for
me to do. Full of mortification, and hurt to the very quick, I
retired.
I waited for Bunder until he emerged from the Court.
"Sir," I said, "I never intended to appear for you in any other
charaoter than that of a friend. As a friend, not a Counsel, I have
appeared for you. But from this moment your qualification as a
friend ceases.
"Appear for me as a Counsel!" he exclaimed, soornfully. "More
of the Sell than the other! You '11 never be Lord Chancellor!"
»•»»•»
As I have hinted, this occurred many years ago. Calmly con-
sidering the matter now, with an experience mellowed by time, I am
of opinion that my client's excitement was pardonable, as the pro-
fessional assistance I was then able to afford him was not of as much
value as I could have wished—earnestly, most earnestly could have
wished! As for his prophecy, he was right—I never have been

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WHICH IS WHICH P
(By Our Bewildered Critic, who was in two places at once.)
The Empress Theodora, when first seen in the play, is giving
andience to a Parisian of the period and other bores, and soon
becomes weary of her Court, and especially of one of its chief func-
tionaries, who will wear a dress-improver, whioh it seems was known

"Very like, very like."—Hamlet.
in those days, though Mr. Godwin cruelly left it out in Claudian.
The Empress thinks it " sich imperence," and, soorning the luxury
that caused the ruin of the Roman Empire—e.g., a big drum, to play
upon, all to herself—she goes off to the Hippodrome, to see her old
friend Tamyris (Madame Marie Thorns), to get a philtre for
Justinian (M. Shelton Garnier). Arrived at the Byzantium Arcade,
the Empress unbends, and we see her laughing and danoing with the
Sorceress in truly affable fashion. In the first scene Madame Marie
Bernhardt was lithe and languorous, and in the second Mdlle.
Sarah Linden was smart and sinuous; indeed, the dual character of
the Empress was never better represented, and Justinian hardly
recognised his better half when he saw her double.
A conspiracy in Byzantium must have been a nice thing for the
neighbours, as we discover when taken to the house of Andreas, a
"masher" and a politician,
who, with his friends, is
plotting against the Empire,
for a merry chorus goes on all
night, ami each conspirator
brings his particular instru-
ment, that is, he is instru-
mental in working out the
plot. In this scene Mr. J. L.
Mabais acted with consider-
able power, whackiog his
fellow-conspirators on their
breasts with genuine force,
while M. Toole, "De la
Comidie Anglaise." was really
humorous, and his song had
the true classic ring about it.
His attire, too, was arohoeo-
logioally correct, being the
X'Tiiy SpttjKilnos of the anoients,
as represented in the mosaics
of the Criterion. M. Toole's
singing was also much ad-
mired, as being very like that
of the Birds of Aristophanes.
The meeting, however, has
to disperse, for the Empress,
who is a regular Byzantine
"bad'un," comes to see
Andreas, calling herself by
ai other name, while he oalls her naughty names, not knowing she
is Augusta. So the lady becomes very uneasy, and naturally
squirms, and this is a great feature of the pieoe. Madame Marie
Bkrnhardt's squirm is the true " spastna Jmperiale" of Jitvenax,
while Mdlle. Sarah Linden has in it more of the juvenile.
The Emperor twits his wife with being an Actress, which, seeing
the admirable manner in which she plavs the part, is, to say the
least of it, bad manners. But she forgives him, and tells him all
about the plot which the indiscreet Andriae has let out. The Imperial

Andreas.
party hide, Marcellus, the chief conspirator, and Andreas oome on,
the former is captured, but Theodora saves Andreas by shutting the
door bo suddenly in his faoe that poor Andrtas must have got a
nasty one in the eye. Here the acting of Sarah or Marie and
M. Toole or Marais, I forget which, was very fine. Then ensues a
scene which baffles description, and also the conspirators. Marcellus
(M. Ward, of the Porte St. Martin, Trafalgar Square) is brought in,
knocked on the head, and stabbed by Theodora, just to prove what
he had been insisting on for some time, that " his heart was in the
right place." So Marcellus doesn't betray Andrias, and off they all
go to the races, where we see the Emperor and Empress putting on
their denarii in regular Epsom style. Andre"as turns up, and is
promptly gagged, for he certainly says very rude things; and pre-
sently we oome to the last soene of all, where the Empress visits him
in his hiding-plaoe. It seems that Tamyris has given Theodora not
a philtre, but a poison, for the Witch desires to be revenged upon
Justinian, whose Guards have killed her son; and so when Andrtas,
in a most proper manner, will have nothing to say to the naughty
Empress, she gives bim the potion to win back his love. The brew
of Tamyris is potent, for M. Toole was so convulsed (as were his
audience), that several medical men in the house were with difficulty
restrained from flying to his assistance. His anguish was something
really beautiful, and at, the same time, purely classic, the genuine
Gastrodynia Byzantica, as described by the famous Physioian,
Gulielmus Lards, a.d. 532.
I fancy I've got the two pieces a little mixed, but haven't time to
put it right again. Valete et plaudite, as the anoient Low Comedian
used to say.
A ROWLAND FOR AN OLIVER.
At the Class-Day Dinner at Harvard College lately, we are
informtd. Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Author of The Autocrat
of the Breakfast Tabk, read a complimentary poem to Mr. James
Russell Lowell, one verse of whioh runs (a trifle haltingly, if
rightly reported) as follows :—
"By what deep magic, what alluring arts,
Our truthful James led captive British hearts;
"Whether his shrewdness made their Statesmen halt,
Or if his learniog found their dons at fault,
Or if his virtue was a strange surprise,
Like honest Yankees we can simply guess:
England herself will be the first to claim
Her only conqueror aince the Norman came."
To whioh Mr. Punch begs amicably to reply:—
Not halting Statesmen, and not dons outdone,
Taught us to love this lord of sense and fun;
Nor did it come to us as a surprise
To find a Yankee virtuous as wise.
No Holmes, Sweet Holmes I Our pride it nothing
To own us conquered by jour Truthful James.
His "sword and spear in truth were cause of it,
The sword of eloquence, the spear of wit;
For heart, not art, sage head, not iron hand,
Made him the "conqueror" of;our stubborn land.

If he'll come back among us to recapture I

IN A HAMMOCK.
Oh, sweet 'tis to swing in a Hammook 'neath trees.
And feel the soft breath of the Summer's light breeze,
With a j ug to dip iuto or not, as yon please,
Where claret and soda commingle;
You've got a oigar, how it soothes, 'twixt your lips,
And round you an angel in petticoats trips,
And pops in the lemon, omitting the pips,
Till you 're sad at the thought you are single.
When Horace, in old days, exclaimed to his boy,
That linden-bound chaplets could give him no joy,
I thould think not, indeed, what a singular toy,
And bid him look out for no roses;
He never had known of a Hammook, I '11 swear,
Or he'd surely have mentioned the faot, to declare
How well he could swing in all luxury there,
'Mid pleasant Venueian posies.
You feel quite at rest, though the world has been hard,
And you know that you 're not suoh a wonderful bard.
As you thought in your youth, e'er your brow had
grown scarred
By Time's irrepressible fingers;
And you idly refleot on some more foolish verse,
Soft sentiment mingled with epigram terse,
That may win you applause and put tin in your purse,
Wherein it unfrequently lingers.
Then here's to the Hammock, and peace that it brings,
To him who in height of the summertime swings,
While the bird on the branch that hangs over him,
sings,
And the river runs on to the ooean;
I think that it would be most pleasant, don't yon,
Just to lie at your ease all the long Summer through,
And to swing in a Hammook, with nothing to do,
Save rejoice in the exquisite motion.
Earnest in Jest.
"A Fowt.ee is not of much use without a net."
observed Lord Salisbury, with a twinkle in his right
eye. "So I will make him a net."
"You!" exolaimed the Earl of Idsleigh, waking
up. "You make a net for a Fowler! What sort?"
The twinkle twinkled strongly in the Premier's eye
as he replied,—" I shall make him a Baro-net." Then
the noble Earl saw the joke, and wept heartily.
OH, THE JOY OF IT!
Mr. Dresser Rogers, who, from his Buggestive facility of expres-
sion, might be in future very reasonably styled, Mr. Addresser
Rogers, on congratulating the Lord Mayor the other day on his
reoeption of a Baronetcy from the hands of Her Most Gracious
Majesty, expressed, together with many others, a hearty wish that
his Lordship " might enjoy it." The phrase is a happy one, for it
seems to add quite an unexpected zest to the possession of the honour
in question. "How to Enjoy a Baronetcy?" is a question that very
few newly-OTeated Baronets can ever have asked themselves; and it
would be quite worth some enterprising person's while to give it a
practical answer in the shape of a little shilling volume. As dignities
have been falling rather thick of late, "A Hundred Ways of Enjoy-
ing a Baronetcy " at the price named could not fail to sell. Nor
would the Author's task be difficult. The subject is full of sugges-
tiveness. Indeed, there appears to be, when the matter is examined,
a vast amount of quiet enjoyment to be got out of the mere fact of
being a Baronet. There is the pleasure of suddenly springing the
title on an unprepared hotel-keeper, and watching his subsequent
obsequious ambles. It must be, too, an agreeable sensation to drop
a dozen or so of your visiting cards on a orowded railway platform,
and then have them all returned to you bingly, accompanied by
a cringing bow or awe-struok and respeotful stare. It must be
even a refreshing experience, when quite alone, to lie dreamilv on
vour back on a lawn, and say to yourself, "Hang it, this is jolly!
Why, bless me, if I 'in not a real live Baronet I"
But there is no need to continue the list of the whole series
of enjoyments that are to be got out of a Baronetcy adroitly held
in this fashion. Pleasures present themselves on all sides. Even
a street row, ending in a summons and a Police report the next
morning, has its agreeable points. Mr. Dresser Rogers deserves
the thanks of every newly-honoured member of the community.
He has put a perpetual Rosherville within the grasp of even the
gloomiest new Peer.

THE ROYAL WEDDING.
(From an Evidently Ignorant Correspondent.
Sir,—I see by the papers that the Wedding of Prinoess Beatrice is
not to be a State Ceremonial. There are to be "three carriage
8recessions," employing on the whole about eighteen carriages. The
taster of the Horse—fancy only one horse, "the Horse, for the
whole lot!—will be mnch exercised, and, by the way, so will " the
horse." But what bothers me, Sir, is these three carriage precessions,
at least eighteen carriages, and only one horse! I can't get over it
no more will the horse. And suppose that horse, of which Lord
Bradford is "the newlv-appointed master," is laid upl What
then? Will they all walk, or go in donkey-chaises, at so muoh an
hour? They couldn't fit into goat-chaises, or they'd get these at a
low figure. I have never visited the Royal Stables whioh, I believe,
are well worth seeing, but if there's only one horse, all the stalls,
except one, must be empty, unless, like stalls in a theatre during
a run of bad business, they are rilled with dead-heads or dummies.
Will no one ask a question in Parliament as to the salary of the
Master of the Horse—poor horse, I do pity him!—and whether the
country couldn't afford another, or indeed several more for this
particular oooasion? I shall be there to see and to cheer the
Prinoess and her spouse, even though they he in a one-horse shay.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
I MAKE A BID FOB THE PARLIAMENTARY BAB,
hate not come
here to waste
your time, whioh
I know to be of
S-eat value," said
ouncer, as he
took the chair that
Portington had
placed for him,
"but to make a
proposal whioh I
trust will meet
with your ap-
proval, nay, even
approbation."
This address
greatly perplexed
me. As a rule,
Bouncer used to
talk slightingly of my work in the Temple, and suggest that my
briefs were few and far between. Under these circumstances I
thought it advisable to request Bouncer " not to play the fool."
"I was never more serious in my life," replied my visitor; and
then he told me all about it. It appeared that my friend had allowed
himself to be put up as one of the Candidates for the representation
of Coachington in the forthcoming Parliament. The matter had been
managed for him by Limber, of the firm of Snappshott, Limber,
and Pocket, who had suggested that I should be asked to accompany
them on their next visit to the borough in search of support and
enthusiasm.
I confess I felt flattered, the more especially as the name of the
firm was not on the list of my clients. It was decidedly gratifying
to learn that I had been singled out by a distinguished body of
Solicitors as an advocate whose oratory was likely to have weight
with an enlightened constituency, suoh as, no doubt, Coachington
happened to be. If I made a favourable impression, it might lead
to work at the Parliamentary Bar, under the patronage of the vene-
rable Mr. Snappshott and his less elderly partners.
"I wonder why Mr. Limber should have thought of me!" I mur-
mured, with a smile. "No doubt I must have met him in consulta-
tion when he was instructing Counsel representing parties having
kindred interests to my own."
"Well, I rather f anoy the idea originated with me," said Bouncer.
"Limber told me that our meetings required freshening up, and
asked me if I knew anyone who would do. I mentioned you. He
replied he had never heard of you."
Bear me!" I exclaimed, surprised and hurt—"he said that he
had never heard of me P"
"Yes. Then I told him who you were, and he said all right, we
would announce you as ' the distinguished Barrister from London,'
and that perhaps that ' might wake them up a bit.' So I hope you
will oome and help me."
I accepted the invitation, feeling that it was high time that
Mr. Limber should, by practical experience, be able to judge of my
capabilities.
Bouncer was met at the station by his agent on the afternoon of
the day we had arranged for our descent upon Coachington.
Mr. Limber was sharp and smart, and about fifty. His face fell
when he saw me.
"Hallo!" he exclaimed. "Is this Mr. Briefless?"
"Yes, Sir," I replied, with dignity, looking him full in the face
through my spectacles, "my name is Briefless!"
"No offence," replied Mr. Limber. "Dare say it will be all right.
Only I know them better than you. They are a rough lot."
It appeared that, on this account, both Bouncer and his agent
had supplied themselves with a thick overcoat apiece (utterly un-
suitable to the time of year), to be assumed in case of need, which
might be tersely interpreted as in case of briok-bats. During the
journey down, my two companions compared notes about the details
of the election. So far as I could make out from their conversation.
Bounces was the unpopular Candidate, and found it very uphill
work in opposing his political antagonist, Mr. Chesterfield
Sparrow. When we reached our destination, Limber (who until
this moment had been on the easiest terms of familiarity with his
principal) got out of the train, and with exaggerated deference
assisted Bouncer to alight. Bouncer smilingly walked down the
platform, and shook hands with the collector who asked for his
ticket. He also shook hands with the clerk in the booking-office;
also with the station-master.
"Very sorry, Gentlemen," said the last-named official,
"but I have not been able to get you anything better than
M ei:ton's waggonette. I suspect that Mr. Chesterfield Sparrow
has given them the tip to let you have nothing else. But
such as it is—there it is."
"How about the band ?" asked Limber.
"The drum is still quite sober, Sir," replied the Station-master,
cheerfully, "and he will pull the others through, you may depend
upon it."
$ Thus encouraged, Bouncer, Limber, and I left the platform and
walked into the street. Our appearance was greeted with yells of
disapprobation from a body of roughs, who had evidently been look-
ing out for us. Limber, with muoh presence of mind, signalled to
the drummer to play up, and the tumult was drowned in strains of
musio, which beoame louder and louder as the other performers
emerged one by one from a neighbouring publichouse. Bouncer
was bowed into a waggonette (which, as compared to other vehioles
nf the same class, was as a Heme Bay bathing-machine is to a Lord
Mayor's coach) with marked courtesy by Limber and myself. The
remaining places were then immediately ocoupied by sons of toil in
corduroys and shirt-sleeves. The unpopular Candidate immediately
shook hands with them, and with ourselves on the box, drove off as
rapidly as possible to the place of meeting—a field about a quarter of
a mile from the railway station. The crowd followed us hooting.
"It is all right," exclaimed Limber, triumphantly, when we had
pulled up; "he has come after all!"
The person whose arrival had given the Solicitor so much satisfac-
tion, was a short, stumpy-looking, red-faced little man in a pot hat.
He climbed into the waggonette, and touching his hat respectfully
to Bouncer, entered into explanations Beemingly having to do with
his advent. The driver of the waggonette had in the meanwhile
descended, and was holding the head of the horse—an extremely
venerable creature, quite a Montefiore of its species—and we were
surrounded by some two hundred persons. Bouncer took off his
hat, and was greeted with prolonged howling, tempered with the
stentorian cheers of the still sober and always conscientious drummer.
"I am much affected, Gentlemen, by this reception," cried
Bouncer, at the top of his voice, " it is most gratifying, and I thank
you from the bottom of my heart."
From this point, Bouncer's speech was inaudible, and delivered
in dumb show. However, that (Limber explained to me) was of no
moment, as a written copy of it had been brought down from town
and placed in the hands of the reporter of the local paper.
"Not a single egg this time, and scarcely a dozen cabbage-stalks!"
exclaimed Limber, greatly pleased, when Bouncer had been yelled
back into his seat. "On my word, I do believe we are becoming
popular! And now. Sir, you will hear our pet speaker."
The stumpy red-faced little man held out his hand, as if asking
for attention. In a moment the orowd became silent, and listened
intently—a few would-be noisy individuals being promptly subdued
with an angry exclamation of "Hold your row I The orator (for
he was a born orator) delivered one of the most eloquent speeches I
have ever heard. He spoke to the people as one of themselves. He
like you, earn my bread by the sweat of my brow I I, like you, glory
in the name—grander than that of any Duke or Earl—of an honest,
fair-handed, warm-hearted, liberty-loving, f oreigner-soorning English
—yes, English, my lads—English working-man!"
This sentiment was received with thunders of applause, amidst
which I asked Limber for some account of the speaker.
"He is called Welsher Dick," shouted the Solicitor into my ear,
"has been warned off nearly every race-course in the United King-
dom, and is at present making a precarious livelihood by acting as
assistant chucker-out in a low-class gambling-house. The first time
I saw him he was in the dock of the Old Bailey, being tried for
nearly killing his wife with a quart-pot."
Taken completely by surprise by this very unexpected answer, I
could only stare in the depth of my astonishment.
"Welsher Dick" finished his speech amidst great and general
applause, and then it was Limber's turn to appeal to the audience.
But no, they would not hear him; and once more there was an exhi-
bition in dumb show.
"I thought so," said Limber to me, with some bitterness, as he
retired. They have heard me before! Besides, they want to see
what you are like! Mind, as they are a rough lot, that you don't
offend them. You had better begin at once—nothing irritates them
more than being kept waiting."
Thus urged, I put on my spectacles, took off my hat, and smiled.
I was received with roars of laughter. I raised my hand, and the
clamour increased threefold. I was met with insulting cries
reflecting on my personal appearance, gratuitous advice to go home,
and ironical inquiries for myautobiography.
"Friends," interposed Welsher Dick, at the instigation of
Limber, "you have been promised a distinguished Barrister from
London—here he is. I ask you as one of yourselves, as a working
man like yourselves, as one of the people, to let him have a patient
hearing." The mob gave the speaker three cheers. While this was

going on I tried to poll myself together and collect my thoughts. It
suddenly struck me that I might commenoe my address effectively
by recounting an imaginary dialogue between an aristocrat and an
artisan, in which the former, of course, would ultimately be worsted
by the latter. I settled that the aristocrat should commenoe the
dialogue by expressing his dislike to the class to which his opponent
belonged. So when the cheers had subsided, and the audienoe were
eagerly waiting for my first words, I was ready with my opening.
I nate," said I, with muoh heartiness, in my assumed character
of the prejudiced aristocrat, "I hate the working-man." Here I
paused, and for the first time looked around. The sea of faces
frightened me, and I lost my nerve. In a moment all I had
arranged to say disappeared, and my mind became a blank. About
what happened next I have never been quite dear. I have a lively
recollection of something hitting me on the head and smashing in my
hat, and I distinctly remember that there was an angry yell. Then
I fancy the waggonette must have been taken by storm. All I know
for certain is that I was conveyed to the police-station, after a very
gallant rescue, executed by a picked body of county constabulary.
"If you will wait a little, Sir," said the Inspector, "we can
smuggle you out the back way just before the train starts, and land
you in a carriage before they can get at you."
This difficult and dangerous programme was successfully carried
out. On reaching home I was upbraided by my wife, who was
greatly put out because I had lost my watch and other articles of
value. This was hard to hear, but the ingratitude of Bounces was
harder—from that day to this he has never once thanked me for
the support I gave him when he was unsuccessfully seeking election
at Coachington. As for Snappshott, Limber and Pocket, they do
not seem to have any Parliamentary business, if I may judge from
the otherwise unaooountable omission of their names in my Fee-
Book. A. Briefless, Junior.
"the ring AND THE BOOK."
Noras from Our Own Sportsman.
(Specially Engaged for the Forthcoming Important Events.)
Sin,—You are right. In these days Racing oannot be neglected.
Not a Journal but has at least a column per diem^ devoted to the
noble sport,—and you, Sir, must not be behindhand in the race.
To-morrow is the Leicestershire Cup Day. Having exceptional
means of knowledge at my command, your readers will do well to
keep their eyes open, and, if they only read me aright, there will be
rioh men among them before to-morrow's sun his course has run.
Now to begin, and, as the Ghott in Hamlet says, " Mark me."
If Royal Fern runs generously, and puts all his legs into it, I
Bhould not be inclined to look beyond him for the winner,—that is, I
am bound to say, if he holds his own to the last, and does not allow
himself to be collared by an antagonist,—though of this I have no
fear whatever, as long as his Jockey keeps the others at a respectful
distance, and puts on the spurt at the right moment. Should Pritm
realise my high opinion of what ought to be, as I was saying to his
owner, "his more than excellent qualities," then there will not sit
down a happier party to supper on Thursday night than the backers
of tie son of Uncas. He is ridden by Watts, who is a true artist,
and refused a Baronetcy the other day—more power to his elbow—
though, at the same time, he must not presume too much on the
Bunbury Mile and Gosforth Park viotories, which only demonstrate
the necessity of Btill keeping him well ahead of all the others, if he
is to fulfil the anticipations of his best friends.
In the London Clubs, up to late last night, was heard a ory of
Despair, whioh, as I remarked at the time, was very like a wail.
For my part I, personally, put no faith in these obiter dicta, as I am
sure that if the offspring of See-Saw can only once get the lead, no
matter when, in the course of the race, and having once obtained it
manage to retain it until he passes the Judge's box, the chances of his
opponents will be reduced to a minimissimum. The "Cognoscenti,"
who flatter themselves on knowing stable seorets, whisper in my ear that,
should Reine Blanche come romping in two lengths ahead of the Duke
of Richmond, and give the "go by" to Prism, Despair, the Eastern
Emperor, and the others, she will then be as certain of taking the
Erize as if it were now in her owner's hands. I confess I am more or
!ss of this opinion myself, and shall not be surprised if the result
proves my surmise oorreot. Let those laugh last who win, say I, and
if all the others are not in it at the finish with the fair soion of the
house of Rotherhhx, she will have the chuokle all to her own
sweet self.
Wild Thyme is a scenter of attraction to those who " know a bank"
and can draw on it to any amount; I fancy there be some of the
friends of the Lowlander's family who will have a " wild time" of it
should ToMXiNSON come in at the head of the poll, a not altogether
impossible event, nor even improbable, under certain conditions, to
which I can do no more than allude, "without prejudice," as the
lawyers say. The Duke of Richmond is a game and generous horse,
so generous as to be able to give 8at. 2lbs. to almost any other in the
field if he liked, but if they follow my advice in mis matter, his
owner will do nothing of the sort. Archer rides him, and if, at the
last moment, he does not allow him to yield his front plaoe to number
two, be itPrttm, Corunna, or any other 'runner " that may happen to
be next him, but brings him in, as they say, "primus inter pares, then
I have no doubt in my own mind that antagonism will be useless, and
that the popular jockey will add another leaf to his crown, or, as I
might say, if the horse's colour permitted it, another bay to his
laurels.
Corunna is as near an approach to a certainty as there is on the
cards, if Bloss pushes her to the front, for she wants pushing, at
the right moment, as in suoh cases position is everything. I am a
bit near-sighted, and can't see the race without Barnacles,—but
more than this it would not be fair for me, with the exceptional
knowledge I possess, to say. "Verbum sap," as the poet has it.
Taking 'em for all in all, and giving one last look round, I still
stick to my original seleotion for the Leicestershire Cup, which cheers
but does not inebriate the true sportsman, and, bar I'imprivu, I
think those of your readers who shall follow my advice will have no
cause to complain, or to be in the least dissatisfied with the f oreoasts of
The Old Hermitage. Peeper the Hermit.
WHY I DID NOT WIN THE QUEENS PRIZE.
(By the Man with a Grievance at Wimbledon.)
Because I did not allow enough for the wind in my first shot.
Because I allowed too much for the wind in my second.
Because the wind was all over the plaoe in the first stage.
Because there was no wind at all in the last.
Because someone spoke to me just as I was going to fire.
Because the marker must have been dozing.
Because, although carrying everything off at other meetings, I was
not in form in Surrey.
Because my rifle was out of order.
Because one can never trust the Government ammunition.
Because I had the worst position at the ranges.
Because there was something wrong with the targets.
Because, hadn't it been in eaoh case for the most trifling aocident
in the world, I should in each stage have oertainly gained "the
highest possible."
And, finally, for the most conclusive reason imaginable,—some
other fellow got it I

priate lines for Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft's farewell, that will have
already taken plaoe by the time this letter finds its way into print, I

occasion. Suffice it to say that I had brought in even the Conduotor

A NEW DEPARTURE.
That most amusing gentleman, the Secretary of State for India,
never showed a greater amount of audacity, tempered with common
sense, than when he introduced an important matter to the House of
Commons the other night, by saying that he should not occupy the
valuable time of the Members by explaining its various provisions,
and the arguments by which they might be supported, as there was
an admirable artiole in the Times of the previous week that put
the whole case in far better language than he could hepe to use, and
to which, he would refer those industrious gentlemen opposite who,
pencil in hand, were awaiting a lengthened statement. The noble
Lord then resumed his seat, and, before his opponents could recover
from their profound astonishment, the matter was agreed to.
This successful attempt opens up a wide field for saving valuable
time. "We will imaguie the Financial Member for the City bringing
forward a motion in favour of so altering the incidence of the
abominable Income Tax as to discriminate between Income from
Land or Consols, and Income from business or profession, or, in
other words, between real and unreal property. The House is look-
ing forward with dread to an interminable Essay upon the facts of
the case, bristling with Statistics, and similar awful nuisances, when
the Hon. Member, with that modesty that so well becomes the
descendant of the ancient Mother, who so loved her dog, informs the
delighted House that the whole subject was treated so admirably
lately by the Paper that has the largest Liberal circulation in the
world, that he will rest his case on that convincing article, to which
he refers the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who at once replies
that, instead of wearying the House with a number of minute
details, he begs to refer the Right Hon. Gentleman to a most splendid
Artiole that appeared on Monday in the columns of the Paper that
has the largest circulation in the world, whether Liberal or other-
wise, in which every statement or argument relied upon by his
Right Hon. friend is utterly denied, or ruthlessly annihilated; upon
which the House at once proceeds to a division, and the whole thing
is settled in about ten minutes; and as no sane man ever thinks of
reading the Parliamentary Debates in extenso, no one would regret
the change except the Bores of the House; and, as it is well under-
stood that no speech ever changes a vote, the result to the country
would always be the same as under the present dull and dreary
system. "We shall look forward with great curiosity to see who the
self-denying Member will be who will have the pluok and the good
sense to follow this excellent example of the Secretary of State
for India.

"ARM, ARM, YE BRAVE!"
To arm our soldiers with bayonets that bend, and our policemen with truncheons that
break, is certainly suggestive of a careful consistency in stupidity. But that is all that can
be said for it. Poor Police-Constable Davis might have been inolined to say that, in such a
case at least, "consistency is the bugbear of small minds." Dates had, in the usual way of
business, to tackle a couple of armed burglars on a house-top at Kensington. He did it, too,
though circumstances placed him at considerable disadvantage. His alarm-whistle, it appears,
had been " called in for stamping," or some such routine purpose. It was, therefore, of as
little use to him as the magical Danish Whistle to the lover who hadn't got it. In the
second place, his trunoheon—being " contract trash "—broke in three pieces at the first blow
he dealt at his enemy. The consequence was, that Davis got three bullets in his body, and
the burglars—who are not, luckily for them, armed by the State—got off. This is highly
encouraging—to the burglars. Law, armed with a rotten truncheon, and minus even its alarm-
whistle, can scarcely be much of "a terror to evil-doers." Is it not high time that the official
duffers who supply our military and civil defenders with "contract trash" arms should
themselves be called in for stamping "—with the brand of public disgrace P

THROPIST.
Pomona Road and Gardens, N.,
Were pure as they were fair.
In other districts, much I fear.
That vulgar language shocks the ear,
But brawling wives or noisy men
Were never heard of there!
No burglar fixed his dread abode
In that secure retreat,
There were no publichouses nigh,
But chapels low and churches high.
You might have thought Pomona Road
A quite ideal beat I
Yet such was not at all the view
Taken by B 13;
That active and intelligent
Policeman deemed that he was meant
Profound detective deeds to do,
And that repose was mean!
Now there was nothing to detect
Pomona Road along,—
None faked a cly, nor cracked a crib,
Nor prigged a wipe, nor told a fib,—
Minds cultivated and select
Slip rarely into wrong!
Thus, bored to desolation, went
The Peeler on his beat.
He knew not Love, he did not care
If Love be born on mountains bare;
Nav, Crime to punish or prevent
Was more than dalliance sweet!
The weary wanderer, day by day,
Was marked bv Howard" Fry—
A neighbouring Philanthropist,
Who saw what that Policeman missed—
A sympathetic " Well-a-day!"
He'd moan, and pipe his eye.

"To soothe that brother's pain P
His glance, when first we met, was keen,
Most martial and ereot his mien,

But he must joy again!

When youths and men, and maids unwed,
Were stabbed, or knocked upon the head,
Then B 13 grew sternly bright,
And was himself again I
Pomona Road and Gardens, N.,
Are now a name of fear.
Commercial travellers flee in haste,
Revolvers girt about the waist

While Howard Fht does deeds of bale

To lighten that Policeman's woes,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE NEW FOURTH PARTY. IMITATION IS THE SINCEREST FLATTERY.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commom, Monday Night, July 13.—Grand triumphal
entry of Gorst, taking hia seat after re-election on becoming
8ol]C[tor-General. All the forces of the late Fourth Party mus-
tered to do honour to occasion. Gobst marched up between R ^ndolph
and Wolff, whilst Arihur Balfour beamed on the prooession from
Treasury Bench.
"Happiest moment of my life," said Randolph. "All my Party
proyided for. Little difficulty about Wolffs-, but that will be
arranged. Nuisance is, that as we '11 only be in five months, the delay
in gazetting appointment is serious matter. Lost nearly a month's
salary now. Must frighten Beach. Wish I'd got up, and de-
nounced his Budget Scheme the other night; but soon find another
opportunity. Think I '11 take up the Crofters' Bill, and abuse
Beach for dropping it. That '11 fetoh 'em. Wolff's appointment
will be gazetted forthwith, and I '11 stipulate that they shall pay him
six months' salary in advance."
_ Questions growing again. Forty-two to-night, which is something
like old times. Chaplin oame out strong on Swine Fever. Paget asked
simple question. Chaplin produced prodigious roll of manuscript.
u Surely, he's not going to read that!" said Hicks-Beach, breath-
lessly. But he was, and did, not omitting a word. House murmured,
coughed, laughed, and finally roared. Randolph kicked him on the
calf, and pretended it was Ashmead-Bartlett. But Chaplin went
on wallowing in particulars, finishing his oration amid hubbub that
made him inaudible.
"If Chaplin's going to do this every night," said Sir Peel, "he
must make his answer as Fitz-Wtgram makes his speech."
Fitz-Wtoram's way certainly novel, and not unattractive. Comes
down with speech prepared on matters relating to Army. Has good
deal to say in miscellaneous manner. Knows House of Commons
hates long speeches, so has hit upon charming device. On Vote for
Men reads a portion of his manuscript, till he observes indications of
impatience on part of audience, and feels a little tired himself. Then
sits down, and Vote is disposfd of. Next Vote on account of Volun-
teers' pay and allowance. Fitz-Wtgram catches Chairman's eye,
begins exactly whtre he left off, and goes on till he hears Members
yawning, then pulls un. Even with all diligence couldn't finish
to-night on successive Votes. Found himself at eleven o'clock with
five pages of manuscript, and Government consenting to report
Srogress. But wasn't christened Frederick Wellington for nothing,
•idn't serve through Crimean War without picking up a wrinkle.
Dashed in, and began to read. McCoan jumped up, and insisted on
reporting progress. General sat down. Up again when McCoas
reseated.
"Often," said the General, with one eye on the paper, and another
on the enemy opposite, "in these circumstances, nones and oamels
die, and become inefficient."
"Order! order!" cried the Chairman. "Question is, that I
report progress, and ask leave to sit again."
Fitz-Wtgram down like a shot when Chairman rose. Up again
as soon as he resumed his seat. "In 1882 "he continued.
"Order! order!" cried the Chairman.
General now quite bewildered. Only thing to be done was to go
on with his manuscript: —
"In 1882 the Infantry soldiers who were sent to Aldershot"
"Order! order!" roared the Chairman. "Order! order!
bellowed the Committee; and Fitz-Wtgram, holding on to his
manuscript as if it were a sword-hilt, sat down, and stared about
him with mute request that some one would oblige him by explain-
ing what was the matter. Finally, on understanding that Fitz-
Wtgram hadn't more than five pages to read, Motion for progress
withdrawn, and the General finished last instalment of speech.
Business done.—Votes on Army Estimates,
Tuesday Night.—la Lords to-night, Northbrook very angry
about Beach, who 'sheen " saying things " about him in the Commons.
The saying amounts to this, that, whereas Childers reported a
saving of Two Millions on Vote of Credit, present Government, when
they came into office, found little more than One Million in hand, rest
having been disposed of by my Lords of the Admiralty.
"All very well for Northbrook to protest and bluster," says the
bland Bramwell, "but where's the odd MillionP Perhaps he's
not personally responsible for it. Accepted what was told him at
the Admiralty. But he'd have done better to say he's very sorry,
victim of system and all that kind of thing, and then join Hamilton
in vigorous effort to improve system. This blowing out of the cheek
and querulous complaint about Beach is nonsense.
Another oharge by Beach of preparing torpedo-boats without
torpedo gear, Northbrook hotly denounces as "one of the most
extraordinary naval mares'-nests that had ever been found."
"What's a naval mares'-nestP" I asked Bhasset, who's just
been caught and brought home.
"Don't quite know. Suppose it's—er—something to do with a—
er—sea-horse, don't you know."
Sensible man, Brasset. Overwhelmed with labours at _
As soon as Ministry resigned went off on a yachting tour am
to leave address. Very angry at being brought back.
"Good gracious, Tobt! he cried, with unusual access of anima-
tion. "There's nobody such a—er—fool as to suppose I know
anything about the Admiralty. Nice place. Appearance of some-
thing to do. Makes one a Minister, and that sort of thing. If we
were wrong, glad it was done respectably. None of your low fifty
or—er—sixty thousand pounds, but a good Million."
In Commons the most agreeable and satisfactory debate heard for
a long time. Stanhope made statement on introducing Education
Estimates, supplemented by speech from Mundella, which shows
enormous strides in national education with corresponding beneficial
results direct and indirect.

"Pleasant evening you've had," I said to Beach, after it was
over. Whioh was the most pleasant incident, the bantering of Har-
court, the reproach of Broderick, the rebuke of Charles Lewis,
the high scorn of Hartlngton, or the patronage of Tim Hkalt?"
"Well, to teH you the truth, Toby," he said, with a wearied sigh,
"it was when Tim Healt was patting me on the back that I
bitterly wished I'd resisted the temptation to betray Northccots."
Business done.—None.
A CASE OF HEARTLESS CRUELTY!
A perfectly trifling error of about £850,000 in the accounts of
the late Board of Admiralty was made 60 much of, as if such a
thing had never happened before, and such a very unusual fuss was
made about it, that it was thought desirable that the late First Lord
and the late Secretary should attend in Parliament and give some
sort of explanation to those low fellows "who want to know, you
know." But neither of those illustrious ex-officials was in Town.
The ex-First-Lord had a pleasant engagement in the country which
would probably detain him for about a week, when he would return
and see all about it. But where was the ex-Secretary P and echo
answered, where? Most men who know that pleasant and popular
gentleman know full well what would be his course of action
directly he was released from the boredom of office. A telegram
would fly with lightning speed to his trusty Captain, and he would
follow the pleasant telegram on the wings of an express train to the
haven of his beautiful Yacht; he would at onoe rush on board, weigh
anchor, spread the white sails to the fair breeze and thoughtfully
remembering to forget to leave his address, speed away anywhere,
anywhere, so that it was direct from Whitehall. And so it turned
out, but his heartless ex-colleagues with a refinement of cruelty
seldom equalled, never surpassed, forwarded telegrams to every place
at which he might possibly touch, urging his immediate return on
most urgent public affairs. We may endeavour but in vain to fanoy
what his feelings were when he found awaiting him at the very first
port he rashly entered an awful-looking telegram such as we have
described, adding too, possibly, that there was a little matter of
£850,000 deficiency in the accounts which it was desirable should be
cleared up. His first thought, doubtless, was to write a little cheque
for the amount, but as that would have been pleading guilty to
some slight inadvertence, it was at once abandoned.
We most of us know something of the language used by our Jack
Tars, and even by those who only occasionally go down to the sea in
ships of their own, when anything of a particularly annoying cha-
racter ruffles their usuallv serene temper; so we would rather not
have to record the nautical expressions that probably fell from Sir
Thomas Brassey's lips when he had fully fathomed the full meaning
of that terrible telegram.
Oh, the contrast of those two short runs! In the first we can
imagine the rapture of the escaped Secretary, as his beautiful Yacht
ran before the wind, and bore him swiftly away from boredom and
anxiety. And then suddenly finding himself bound in honour to
'bout ship and return, as the Judge says, to the place from whence
he came, and enter upon a tedious and troublesome inquiry that
cannot bring him honour and may bring blame. And. in such
weather too: The punishment seems awfully severe, and everyone
who knows his genial nature will cordially wish him a speedy release,
and a swift return to that summer sea that he loves so well.

Some features of a Race Meeting,
and two remarkably straight tips.
TIPS! TIPS! TIPS!
{More of " the Ring and the Book." By Our Specially-engaged
Sportsman.)
Odds, my life 1" as the Book-makers used to say in the
last century, but I may refer your readers to my letter last week
with the confidence of a man who
knows what he is writing about, and
who has by this time earned the
gratitude of the astute Sportsmen
who, seeing what I meant about the
Leicestershire Cup, cleverly avoided
the Duke of Richmond, and backed
Corunna.
The Jockey was Wall—a regular
Brick "Wall. Let the weakest go to
the Wall for advice in the future,
and if he's up to his Thursday form,
the Brick-lavers may back him at
long hods. Lord Hahtington was
immensely pleased. Well, "'tis a
poor Haht-ington that never re-
joices!" And now for Goodwood.
"Off, off! cried the Stranger;" but
I forget on what occasion the
Stranger cried off. It might have
been applied to Goodwood this year,
and would have meant that, as
there were fewer than ten accept-
ances for the Goodwood Stakes, the
race became void, and all bets were
off. This is the first time such a
thing has happened in the history of
Goodwood, and is one of the greatest miss-Btakes of modern racing
times. It must not occur again.
Ere this letter appears, the first day's racing will he over at Good-
wood. How about the second day? I do not intend to be too minute
about the second, but still have a word or two to say for the benefit not
of those who run horses, hut who read leaders. For the Stewards' Cup
1 can only say that if Lord Habtington doesn't have it for his side-
board, it will be because the horse which has so suddenly Bloss-omed
into a winner may be full blown before he reaches the post, and will
have yielded his place to those who shall have earned a right to occupy
it. Sweetbread is one of the entrees, and Hermitage doesn't go badly
with this dish. If I am told that all the horses down in the list will
come up to their several owners' expectations, I reply, "Sir. you
are a romancer; but there is such a thing as winning by a Neck-
romancer." In some cases it's neck or nothing. "Brag's a good
dog," and you will see whether this applies to him as a horse. Much
depends on the weather, the state of the bellows, and the riding; so,
apropos of Brag, let us sing, Shakspearianly, "Hay hoe, the wind
and the rein 1"
Talking of singing. Lord Cadogan may strike up " They've none
got a Mate but me!" and, as an Irish Friend of mine observed.
"There's more than may mate the eye in that horse." A good deal of
fine work about Lactman. Honiton soit qui mal y pense, and I
recommend my readers to keep a wary eye on his Hopperations.
How easily Laceman may be turned into Placeman anyone who
minds his p's and q's" (and. after this, no one can x q's himself for
not minding his p's) will see. Many a true word's uttered in jest, and.
if the jest is bad, why, as the man who would make a pun would
pick a pocket, "jest send," says my Irish Friend again, "for a
P'laceman." Omens strike some people forcibly. When you are
training to Goodwood, look out for a Porter, and, if he's a half-
and-half chap, be cautious how you deal with the Duke of Richmond
(there's only one .Richmond in the field, mind), and, when you
alieht, ask about Luminary, and you may get a perfect Blaise.
No Time like the Present Times, though, of course—that is, of
race-course—it will be not unwise to make an exception in favour of
Wild Thyme. Mind, Wild Thyme grows. When you want some-
thing to suit, give a look round at the Tatt.obs'. If tired, go to
Bed-ouin, which rhymes with Willie Edouiit, the eoeentrio
Comedian, and this is but another way of spelling Ed-win. A
oookney. who may drop his money but retain his " h's," might read
thia Hea-win. But this may or may not be. Whatever your luck
may have been hitherto, let "Nil Desperandum" be your motto
when you 're near Despair. Look out I Two for her heels! But
Nil Desp. would have been a fine motto for the scuttling policy in
Egypt; "Despairing of the Nile." However, I am a sportsman
first and a politician afterwards.
For the rest of the field I can only say, and those who know me
know that I mean what I say and say as muoh as I mean, that is,
when I've said all I mean, keep your Bright Eye and your Dart-
mouth open, think of Childhood's happy days before a White-lock
to tfcfaool with a Satchel which you dis-
carded in the holidays, when you were taken to see a spectacle at
the Theatre near old Hungerford Bridge, entitled Hobson's Choice;
or. The King of the Furies, the principal characters being Albert
Melville, Adelina, who, as a Pearl Diva, sang a song about Oyster
Patti, a mysterious Domino, an Eastern Emperor, who was always
running after an Oriental Girl, who, as she would have nothing to
say to him, was mistaken for a Crosspatch, and repulsed him with
an Energy which might have, in old times, distinguished a
Highland Chief, and in modern times would have distinguished the
plucky Commander of the Condor. It will not do for me to pretend
to absolute certainty as a tipster, or I might be inclined to be frank
with you about Sir Francis. Do you know the river Stour Y Well,
you may not set the Thames on fire, but can you find a matoh for a
Stour-tcick f
To return to omens. Going into a reading-room, a friend of mine
the other day tripped over some cocoa-fibre matting, but as he was
out for a trip, it didn't matter. What did he exclaim ?" Ha.'
matting!" Is this anything resembling Harmattan? Then sitting
down to luncheon, he was disappointed in not seeing beef, and cried
out, "Ha! mutton.'" What does this portend? He kicked the
black-and-tan terrier, accidentally, as he explained, because not on
any account would he Harm-a-tan. These may be coincidences: I
give them for what, they are worth.
Hot weather! Do you wish you were on the Boulevard f or down
on the Royal Fern, in the shady Glen Albyn, going in a bucket to
the Lang-well, whioh is as broad as it's lang, and I'm as deep as
that is. Do I say If ave well alone? Give me a quiet dinner at Royal
Hampton, and let Satiler provide the saddle for the party, and after

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE WHITE-BAIT SEASON.
Rustical Maiden Aunt (who is unacquainted with this "delicacy of the Season "),
'N-NO, THINK YOU I No S'RIMPS, THANK YOU!!"
QUITE NEW AND ENTIRELY ORIGINAL.
Dear Mr. Nibbs,
As I know you take an interest in theatrical matters, will you allow
me to tell you of a curious coinoidenoe I have recently discovered? Thank you.
Then here (roes. 1 remember seeing somewhere, very many years ago, a play
the oentral idea of whioh was a fraud committed by two persons upon a Baronet
who had left in their oustody his son by a secret marriage. In this old piece the
agent of the Baronet—his Solioitor—had put the boy to school, receiving for his
maintenance a large annual allowance. And in this ancient comedy the Baronet
suddenly turned up, to ask for his until-then-discarded child, to have palmed off
upon him an impostor substituted for the real Simon Pare by the agent, who had
duly received the pay from his principal, without informing that easy-going
individual that the boy for whose support the money had been contributed had
long since run away. Seeing Cousin Johnny the other evening at the Strand,
I was reminded of this old comedy, as the plot of both pieces appeared to be the
same.
But I liked the original comedy at the Strand far better than the original
comedy at the Haymarket,—I am almost sure the piece I recollect was played
at the Haymarket,—because it was much simpler in construction. Instead of a
solicitor and a schoolmaster imposing upon the Baronet as in the original, at the
Strand it is a husband (a man who had been the Baronet's servant) and his wife
who commit the fraud. In the Old Haymarket the changeling was a lad picked
out of the streets, who had been a doctor's boy, a lawyer's clerk, and an omnibus
conductor; at the New Strand the changeling is a barman, and the son of what
I may oall the Baronet's fraudulent trustees. In both pieces the impostor
hero is an innocent party, ignorant of the fraud committed upon the Baronet,
whom he verily believes to be really and truly his parent.
As I sat enjoying the quaint eccentricities of Mr. J. S. Clarke as Johnny, I
could not help thinking of the different reading I had seen years ago, when
a very broad Comedian had played Joe Wadd—ah, to be sure, Joe Wadd at the
old Haymarket was the counterpart of the hero of the oomedy (described in
the bills as "new and" original ") 'at'the" Strand. I
thought, too, how great an improvement had been effected
at the Strand in making the true son of the Baronet
(who is recognised in both pieces in Act III.) the Baro-
net's Private Secretary, instead of a Lieutenant of the
ship that had brought the Baronet over from India with
his nieoe, as he used to be at the Haymarket. It appeared
to me more natural that the rightful heir should fall in
love with his unknown Cousin in that capacity than
merely as a sailor. Besides, the Private Secretaryship
accounted for the heir's
Baronet; while at the Haymarket the meetings
the cousins had to be of a more or less clandestine charac-
ter. But the Strand version has this drawback, the
young lady, Florence Courtney, requires a mother to
chaperone her. At the Haymarket Alice Leslie, having
no avowed admirer, could be an orphan, without maternal
encumbrances. Yet it is only fair to say that, by the
introduction of the General's sister, the unpleasant idea
of the Baronet wishing to sacrifice his son's and nieoe[s
happiness by a foroed marriage disappears, and it is
the young lady's Mamma (omitted at the Haymarket)
who supports the match at the Strand.
As I looked on at the Strand, the dear old times came
back to me, and I jotted down my memories side by side
with the modern fancies. Here is a copy of the leaf from
my note-book:—
Haymarket "Original." Strand "Newand Original."
Joe, avulgarian, is palmed
off upon Sir William Mel-
ville (a Baronet who has been
secretly married when a
Captain in the Army) by
the Baronet's agent, who
has Inst the original, and
who fears punishment for
having pocketed the money
sent to him by Sir William
for that original's mainten-
ance.
Sir William wishes his
son to marry his niece.
Joe refuses to marry
A lice, because he is in love
with Penelope, a servant in
the house of /Sir William's
agent.
Alice is in love with
Henry Melville, who is
known as Jacob Brown.
Sir William's agent in
Act III. repents and con-
fesses the fraud, and Henry
Melville is acknowledged
and betrothed to his cousin,
the girl of his heart.
Joe marries Penelope, and
all ends happily.
Johnny, a vulgarian, is
palmed off upon Sir George
Desmond (a Baronet, who
has been secretly married
when a Captain in the
Army) by the Baronet's
agent, who has lost the
original, and who fears
punishment for having
pocketed the money sent
to him by Sir George for
that original's maintenance.
Sir George wishes his son
to marry his nieoe.
Johnny refuses to marry
Florence, because he is in
love with Tilly, a servant
in the house of Sir George's
agent.
Florence is in love with
John Desmond, who is
known as Hugh Seymour.
Sir George's agent in
Aot III. repents and con-
fesses the fraud, and John
Desmond is acknowledged
and betrothed to his cousin,
the girl of his heart.
Johnny marries Tilly, and
all ends happily.
In both pieces the Baronet is disgusted at the vul-
garity of Joe-Johnny. In both pieces Joe-Johnny is
naturally a good-hearted fellow, who, from first to fast,
has the sympathies of the audienoe with him. At the
Haymarket there was an underplot, no doubt invented
to introduce the various other members of the old com-
pany. This under-plot dealt with female impostors, and

shorter and less elaborate, at the Strand.
The acting in the new and original oomedy is very good
all round. Mr. J. S. Clarke, as Joe-Johnny, could not
be better; he is inimitable—quite the most original inci-
dent of the piece; and it is delightful to see Miss Bupton
as Lady Courtney. Then as Florence, pretty, intelli-
gent Miss Lucy Buckstone 8tay—Buckstonk!
Why, to be sure I Why did I not think of it before?
And I wonder if Mr. Clarke thought of it before I

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

'SACKLY LIKE!
[The Tims; in an article on the acoustic propertiet of the House of Commons, said :—" When crowded, it is like speaking in a bam full of sacks."]
ESSENCE OP PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACT1D FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, July 20.—Ashbourne down to-day,
intending to make maiden speeoh on moving Second Reading of Irish
Land Purchase Bill. Spencer also with speeoh ready. This to he
debate of the evening. But other matters intervene. Bill not
reached till Quarter to Eight. Time to he off to drees for dinner.
Bill urgent; time short. People would say things if Lords adjourn
without dealing with Bill; and yet if debate opened, what about
dinner? Happy thought ooourred to Ash bourne.
"Let's pass Second Reading without debate, and make our
speeches on next stage. Then neither Bill nor dinner will be
damaged." House jumped at suggestion; Second Reading taken at
a gallop, and all over by Quarter past Eight.
Randolph's quite right," said the Markiss. "There's nothing
like the introduction of new blood. No one would have thought of
this only for Ashboubne."
In the House of Commons, matters going a little awry. Ministers
on Treasury Bench practically boycotted by supporters. Beach
tries to put bold face on affairs, but has his moments of depression.
"Never was fellow so unlucky as I," he savs, after alternately
trying what comfort there may be in Geobgie Hamilton's habit of
tearing up bits of paper, and in Randolph's ferocious fondling of his
moustache. "Haven't oonquered the unpleasant feeling about my
deserting Northcote at a critical moment before I tumble into this
business of the Land-Leaguers. Thought, after I'd thrown over
Northcote, Honse wouldn't mind my giving up Spenceb. Seems it
does, and what's worse, it's our own fellows who 're turning up
rusty. Used to talk about late Government being 'humiliated!'
Good word, but isn't strong enough for our fellows to apply to us
after Friday night's business. Do everything for the best, but
everything seems to go wrong. Wish I was back on benoh opposite
with Nobthcote by my side. Don't mind the abuse of the enemy.
What's hard to bear is the contempt of your friends."
Still there are oonsolations. Irish votes on to-night; postponed
day after day in anticipation of a row. But Parnelhtes honourably
keep their share of bargain. True, Windbag Sexton has an hour or
so, Abthub O'Connob makes several speeches, Cobbett treats with
some detail of the history, prospects, and domestic economy of the
Drumdrum Criminal Lunatic Asylum, and the brothers Redmond
rave. But Joseph Gillis opens bis loDg arms to Her Majesty's
Government and clasps Hart Dyxb to his tender breast. (This in
a parliamentary sense, of course.) Pleasing to find Joky B. in this
benevolent frame of mind: more striking even than Windbag
Sexton's beautiful allegory of the "political sky in Ireland almost
obscured with showers of white gloves." Habt Drxs a little
embarrassed by blandishments of Joey, but doggedly repeats
his formula. Doesn't care what happens, whether his personal
reputation grows or diminishes. All he thinks of is the welfare of
Ireland!" Business done.—Irish Estimates voted with both hands.
Tuesday.—Always watch with interest the growth of practice of
introducing objeot-lessons in House of Commons. Lyon Playfatr,
one of the rirst practitioners, with his pots of oleomargarine, and
his specimens of butterine. Then came Fabquhabson, with a cal-
cined cow, conveniently carried in waistcoat pocket. Next, Bboajd-
huest produced masons' tool-chest, and described its contents to
entranced House. Only other night Camebon, denouncing War
Office delinquencies, brought down a singularly-gifted lamp, for
whioh there was no oil, and which would not hold a candle. Now
Onslow brings in a copy of illustrated broadsheet, and, as Truthful
James puts it, "ohucks it at the head of the Home Secbetabt."
"Have you seen it?" Onslow growls, standing immediately
behind the hapless Homb Secbetabt. No answer. "Then here you
are I" and the champion of the Trade thrusts the paper in
Cross's faoe.
Cboss shrank, shuddering, from the oontaot, violently shaking his
head in deprecation of this treatment of Her Majesty's principal
Secretary of State. Onslow's manners equal to occasion. Drops
the paper over Cboss's shoulder. Cross makes desperate attempt to
look as if it wasn't there. Beach takes it up between finger and
thumb, and hands it back. Onslow returns it, and the Chancjellor
of the Exchequer, amid manifest signs of interest on part of
Cavendish Bentincx, throws it under the table.
"Keep your eye on Cavendish Benttnck," Wilfrid Lawson
whispers—" he'll he accidentally roaming about the table presently;
will observe with surprise a paper with pictures in it under the
table, and will innocently walk off with it."
A pretty scene this; fairly indicates present relations between
Government and their supporters. Beach has a particularly bad
time of it; chaffed by Members opposite, and having illustrated
papers and worse things thrown at him from his friends behind.
"It's rather disheartening," said John Manners, looking round
the jeering crowd before him and the angry faces behind, "to go
through weeks of the Session, and no one to cry ' God bless you!'
Wednesday Morning.—Things going from had to worse. C. S.
Read, Lewis, Lowther, Pell, Talbot, all stout Conservatives,
bewailing discredit brought upon Party by action of Leaders. At
Two o'Clook this morning Beach, after gallant effort to keep his
temper, momentarily lost it. Fell, tooth and nail, upon Members on
Front Bench opposite, and snappishly announced that, whatever
happened, the Bill (Medical Relief) should go through Committee.
Harcoubt, nothing loth, accepted this invitation to a row. Ran-
dolph, with a joyous whoop, joins, and regular slanging matoh
begins; finally ends with the Government, aided by the Parnellites,
narrowly escaping defeat.
Business done.—Medical Relief Bill passed through Committee.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Came upon Grand Cboss this afternoon,
peeping in at the House from behind the Speaker's chair.
Walk in! Walk in!" I said with that ready and unforced
humour peculiar to me in the Dog Days. "There's nothing to pay.
What are you looking so anxious about f"
"Ah! is that you, Toby?" said the Homb Secretary, starting.

"Thought it was Onslow. Seen him about anywhere to-day?
Did;he look as if he had an illustrated paper in his pooket? Really,
very^annoying to have a man going on as Onslow does, leaning over
Secretary of State, and rubbing his rosa with an obnoxious news-
paper. Never had to put
up with this kind of thing
before. Don't mean to
stand it now."
"Then vou'd better go
in, put a bold face on it,
and let Onslow know
you 're not to be trifled
with."
"You 're right, Tour;
I'll do it."
And he did it as far as
appearance went, putting
on severe magisterial air,
though shrinking a little
when he discovered Ons-
low in his place, and care-
fully selecting seat out of
arm's length.
"Let him rub somebody
else's nose with his news-
pipers," he muttered de-
fiantly. "There's Ran-
noi.ru. Let him try him.1
Onslow hadn't brought
another newspaper with
him, but repeated his ques-
tion of former day as to
intention of Home Secre-
tary with respect to sale
of certain prints in the
street. Grand Cross, with
wholesome apprehension of a possible newspaper, returned careful
answer, which said nothing particular, but sounded well. Onslow.
after momentary hesitation, deferred further personal application of
the newspaper, and Grand Cross took the earliest opportunity of
leaving the Treasury Bench.
Business done.—One or two Irish Votes agreed to.
Thursday Night.—Letter from Captain Gosset announcing his
retirement from office of Sergeant-at-Arms, held for fifty years. Sir
Thomas Mat could scarcely control his emotion as he read the letter.
Harcourt openly wept, whilst Joseph Gillis, producing a bandana
of vast proportions and mixed colours, suspiciously hid his face.
"Many's the time he's walked me out," said Joey B., with
snuffle that did credit to his emotionable temperament. "Couldn't
say at the moment how many times I've been suspended, but never

Mr. Punch. "I feel that in losing Mr. UosssT we are losing not merely

received anything but courtesy from Gosset. Fancy I can hear his
voice now. 'Joseph Gillis,' says he, laying his hand on my
shoulder, 'the Sprakeb's ordered you out, and out you go by crook
or by hook, by crop or by neck. Come along quietly, for the love of
Heaven, or, as sure as you 're Bitting there, I '11 run you through
with my sword!' Ah! there's where the niceness of the man
oame out. His way was so winning, and his sword so handy, that
I always went with him without making any fugs."
Parnell publicly bore testimony to the esteem in which the good
Gosset is held by Irish Members. So deeply moved, that he actually
attempted to make a joke with sly hit at the lack of amiability and
almost entire absence of humour which distinguishes his following.
Callan took the jibe seriously, and loudly cheered.
Business done.—Government defeated on Medical Relief Bill by
majority of 50.
Friday.—An evening of mixed excitement, and varied interest.
Supposed to have met to pass Supply. Before reaching business,
O'Brien danced upon an Irish landlord: Barclay treated of Procu-
rators Fiscal; Samuel Smith delivered entrancing lecture on Bi-
metalism (" His great grandfather Adam's remarks on the "Wealth
of Nations quite dull after this," said Hart Dyke); Deasy on Earl
Spencer's criminal refusal to appoint Mr. John O'Brien, T. C,
Governor of the Cork Lunatio Asylum; Sexton on Peter O'Gaba
arrested for drunkenness, put in Sligo Police Barracks, and subse-
quently found dead, while another man (who might have been Earl
Spencer) was "found sitting on the floor with his coat and waist-
coat off; " and Molloy "went for" Magistrates of King's County.
Business done.—Some Votes in Supply.
A ROYAL WEDDING.
Princes* Beatrice married to Privet Berry of Bnttmhury. July 23, 1885.
Happy the bride on
whom sobright-
ly shines
Our English eun,
with light from
loyal lines
Of honest En-
glish faces,
A princely hus-
band's fond ex-
ultant smile,
A Royal Mother's
love,—all that
our Isle
Of best and bra-
vest graoes.

The Royal Ring-Doves.
Happy the bride!
And happy may
she be,
The wife, whom Wight's green isle, we trust, shall see
For many and many a season;
England's home-staying daughter, bride, yet bound
As with silk ties, within the dear home-round
By many a gentle reason.
Reasons of heart, with which no rules of state
Clash cruelly. Fair, filial, fond, elate,
Glad bride and daughter loval,
Where'er she flits may it be on love's wing,
Returning sure that in our hearts will ring
A welcoming right royal!
"THEY'VE GOT NO WORK TO DO!"
A Mr. Hagopian having written to Lord Salisbury, pressing on
him the need of carrying out reforms in Armenia, "in conformity
with the 61st Article of the Treaty of Berlin," without being
snubbed, other Correspondents will now probably feel encouraged to
indite letters to the Prime Minister, setting forth the paramount
and immediate necessity of,—
1. Devoting at least half a million of the Tax-payers' money to a
scientific investigation of the recent eruptions of Krakatoa.
2. Sending an Ultimatum to the Czar, reminding him of a sort of
half-promise made twenty years ago, not to attack Khiva.
3. Building twenty thousand miles of Railway to the Equator (also
with Tax-payers' money), to educate the illiterate Savage.
4. Erecting the largest telescope in the world (cost not to exceed
that of one large Ironclad) to discover the particular "Manual of
Political Economy " most in use in the planet Saturn.
5. Re-establishing " Friendlies" all over the world in the " status
quo ante "—any amount of British promises and belief in the same.
6. Getting on in India without the Opium Revenue.
7. And finally—Declaring the fixed conviction of the Government
that the time has at length arrived for (a) Squaring the Circle.
(b) Suppressing Pauperism, (c) Aboli*hing Hard Times, Over-
crowding, Intemptrance, and Crime and Misery generally.

An Iron Soldier! When red War nnfurled
O'er all the myriad leagues of the New World
Its desolating banner, when fierce hate
And brother-sundering fend first shook the State,
Two noble names shone ohiefly, Lee and Grant.
These twain, titanioally militant,
Shoeked like conflicting avalanches. Now
Peace, brooding o'er the land with plaoid brow,
Sees the great lighters fallen. He at last,
The calm, tenacious man. who seemed to cast
Defiant looks at Death, the stoio stern,
Whom long-drawn anguish could not bend or turn,
Lies prone, at peace, alter such stress of grief
As must have found the summons glad relief.
An Iron Soldier! If, as foemen say.
Mixed with true metal much of earthly clay
Marred the heroio in him of full state,
His land will not record him less than great,
Who, in her hour of need, stood firm, and stayed

The people's heart, the patriot muse, may vaunt
The golden service of Ulysses Grant.
TO SOME DISTINGUISHED AMATEURS.
Mr. Creswick, honourably associated so many years in
theatrical management with Mr. Shepherd—they were
the Managerial Siamese twins, the inseparable "Shep-
herd and Creswice "—is going to take leave of the Stage.
We thought he had retired altogether long ago, but are
delighted to find the Cres-wick not snuffed out, but
gleaming with all its former fire. But this is what we
have to suggest, and we suggest it to the Arc hie at of the
Campbells, who will be only too pleased to play in, or
out of, Coombe Wood, and readily wood coombe to the
assistance of the veteran tragedian. Are not "The
Pastoral Players " the very people to do their very.best
for the man who, throughout his professional career, was
always associated with a Shepherd? Do this: help
him by hook or by crook.
What a beautiful real Snow Scene the Pastoral Players
might have in the winter! and why not a Snow Pantomime
with a dance afterwards,—a Snow Ball to follow? But
revenons d nos moutons, as Charles Lamb said.
N.B.—The Committee for the Creswick Benefit meets
at the Lyceum Theatre, Thursday, July 30th, at 2'30 p.m.
QUITE ABOVE BOARD.
The evidence elicited by the Select Committee appointed to inquire
into the recent discrepancies in the Admiralty Account s, having very
naturally created in the minds of the present officials some slight
confusion as to the precise nature of the responsibility falling upon
them each individually in the disoharge of their respective duties,
the following brief preliminary "Paper of Regulations" for the
guidance of the Secretary has already been issued by the Authorities
at Whitehall:—
The Secretary of the Admiralty.
To obviate for the future any possible misconception as to the
limits of the Secretary's official right of interference either with the
sanguine temperament of his Chief or the sportive arithmetic of his
subordinates, he shall, in time of peace, endeavour to make things
pleasant all round—
(1) By avoiding nasty questions that can only lead to disagree-
ables;
(2) By putting a kindly and genial construction on suspicious-
looking Estimates; and
(3) By playfully saying to the First Lord, if possible, after a good
dinner at the Accountant-General's, "You must play your own little
game on your own responsibility, you know. Ha! ha! Don't mind
me! Bless you, I'm not watching you."
In time either of u>ar, or of immediate preparation for it, then a
little more general latitude should mark the Secretary's oonduot;
and, to enable him efficiently to dispose of the, very probably,
embarrassing problems that will present themselves to him in the
course of business, it will be his duty to get hold of a thoroughly
comic Contractor.
This personage, who should be able to imitate animals, and do
some amateur conjuring, the Secretary should at once button-hole,
and, by way of leading up to Government business, ask him a few
good old-fashioned Conundrums. Starting, for instance, with the
well-known amusing puzzle of the Man "going to St. Ives," he
should gradually introduce the departmental matter in hand, and
drop into the sly official humour it will be, above all things, neces-
sary to maintain, with some such question as, "If the Government
wanted twelve colliers at a pinch, with or without crews, for the
purpose of despatching them either as transports, ironclads, or
pleasure yachts, with—no matter how many men—to—never you
mind where, how long would it take them to get there and back, and
what would be the figure at half-a-crown for the first hour and
two shillings for every hour afterwards?"
As the Contractor won't be able to answer this at once unless he is
very funny, or has heard it before, the Secretary should not miss his
chance of scoring, but as soon as his companion is fairly in fits over
it, get out a two-headed halfpenny and oner to toss him the best out
of three whether he shall put the sum, in an anonymous letter to
the Secretary of the Treasury, roundly at £500,000, or hint that it
will be comfortably covered by a five-pound note.
By this time the Contractor will in all probability have gathered
correctly that the sole official idea is to keep up the traditions of the
Department, and propose to finish the interview with a pantomime
rally. In this, of course, the Secretary will join him; and just
popping his head into the First Lord's Room on his way down-stairs,
and shouting, "Oh, you're the best judge of the emergency, are
you f Well—I wouldn't be in your shoes.' "hurry him to the street
with a back somersault or two, and return again to his room, conscious
of the fact that, as far as he is concerned, the country snail have,
at all events as yet, no reason to complain that a good old honest
Admiralty joke is a thing of the past.

And raise her Burning Blush,

And robs the roosts, and, down

Prolongs his caterwaul;
Ah, leave him in his Western

Where Mississippi churns the

Don't bring him here at all!

THE NEW SKOOL OF GILDHALL MUSIC.
Well, the Copperashun's a going it pretty well I thinks, con-
sidring as its only jest escaped from sudden death or a lingring
consumtion from its resigned enemys. Most Copperashuns and other
Publick Bodies who had bilt the finest set of Markets in the hole

carrys off all the biggest prizes in the hole world, that is to say they
wood if they was strong enuff, but they gits so many on 'em as
they 're foroed to have a cab to oarry 'em away to their appy omes—
and the finest free Libery in the hole world—were they has such
lots of Reeders that the werry Poplar Libraryun has to send lots on
'em away to the Brittish Mewsceum coz he ain't got room enuff for
'em—wood have thort as they was now intitled to jest a little rest.
But no, not them, for some bold Common Counselman having hinted
at bilding a Skool of Music, sumboddy sed, "Go to Bath!" and he
went to nim, and then they both gos to a reglar Emperor of a
Alderman and says to him, " let's have a Skool of Music "So we

And now let us see how the littel idear growed to a werry big 'un.
They fust took a house oloBe by and opened it for a Skool of Musick
and thort to have about 20 skollers. In about a year the Marster
cums and says, "this here Skool ain't harf big enuff, for we 've got
200 skollers insted of 20." So they took another big house next to the
other big house, and that went on for a littel time, and then the
Hed Marster cums again and he says, says he, these two big houses
ain't harf big enuff, for we've got 2000 skollers insted of 2001
Well, it takes a good deal to estonish the Copperashun, as I werry
well knos, but I'm told as this did estonish 'em jest a bit. And
every body arsked, "What on airth shall we do P" Then up sprung
a pluoky yung ohap, as can sing a song like a bird, and he says, says
he, "Whit shall we do? Why, bild a reglar Pallis as will hold the
blooming lot quite cumferabel. And they all sang in chorus, "And
bo we will." And when old Deputy SmrFLnra said, "How about
the exptnse?" the imperial Alderman said, "If there's any bother
about that, I '11 pay it myself." So that little matter was soon
settled.
Then they made the plucky yung chap a Cheerman, and sent him
to lay the fust stone of the new Skool on the Terns Imbankmeant,
witch he did it last Wensday with a lovely reel silwer trowell as big
as a spade, and tho the Loan Mabe coudn't cum coz he was a bilding
a Horsepittle or summat of that sort elsewheres, he sent his love to the
plucky Cheerman and lent him won of his Sherryffs and a Alderman
or too and lots of Deputtys and peeple to help him, so it must have
bin quite a grand Bite on the Imbankment, witch I regrets as I didn't
see coz I wasn't there, but was told by them as was, and then they
all come back to dinner, and there I did see 'em in coarse. And
werry good appytights their werry ard work seemed to have guv 'em,
and lots on em made speeches, and werry good uns too considring as
they was ony a Mewsical Committy. And the Hedhitter of the
Timet was there, and he said—as ony sitch a mitey swell coud say—
"If the Copperashun spends about a hundred thousand pound in
bilding up a Skool of Musick, it will shew as they are worthy of the
Times!" It's suttenly a large price to pay for sitch a honner, but I
spose as it carn't well be done for less, and so Cheerman Mobbison
says, "Right you are!" and so it's as good as dun.
The Cheerman made werry short speaches, witch for wunce we was
werry sorry for, as he speaks werry well, but he made hup for it by
singing a grand song in his own grand style. But he quite surprised
us all by snowing us wot a horful raddieal he is I Why, he sung a
song about a King's life being nuffin compared to a Common Coun-
seLman's, witch although I dessay it's trew enuff, for I don't suppose

TENNYSON'S TROUBLE.
Very graceful, no doubt, was the Laureate's

Beatrice, who accepted it, as Her Royal
Highness took Prince Henry, for "better

in the sidereal Heaven's name,—did he mean
by "A conjectured planet in mid Heaven
between two suns" P Polonixu, who so
highly approved of the expression " Mobled
Queen," would certainly have observed,
"' Conjectured planet' is good." But " be-
tween two suns "? Was the Poet Laureate
thinking of the lines in the Critic, about
"Two revolving suns" P Or was he only
"mooning," and not thinking of anything in
particular, except what a bore it was to be a
Poet Laureate, and compelled to turn out
machine-cut couplets to order? However,
his Lordship, the Laureate, may congratulate
himself on the fact that, if there is a " con-
jectured planet" standing like a donkey
between two bottles of hay, or like a noodle
between two stools who comes to the ground,
—we don't mind helping the troubadour to a
simile or two gratis,—and "two suns" left
for his phenomenal planet, at least there are
not two daughters left, whose weddings will
force him to mount his willing, but weary,
Pegasus.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HAYMARKETINQ.
The interior of the Haymarket Theatre, Monday night, July 20,
on the ocoasion of the Bancrofts' Farewell, was a wonderful sight.

Mr. and Mm. Bancroft (singing).
Farewell to the spot where so happy we've been,
And now we are off to the Engidino. [Exeunt dancing.
The heat was intense: not a dry eye hut wanted wetting, and the
other eye also after that.
"Warm, isn't it!" exclaimed the President of the Royal Acad<my,
to Sir Robert Browning—he isn't Sir Robert, but he ought to be;
he's our Sir Robert until our own Rorert gets knighted, than
which there are more unlikely events that may happen in the Home
of Turtle and Fine Linen.
"Warm!" replied Sir Robert Browning. "I wish I were at
the sea-side!"
"What! Walmer !" cried the President.
"Yes, even that," returned the Bard: "for I'd prefer to he
Browning in the sun to be baking under the gaslights.
"How about the Leger?" gasped Mr. John Hare to Captain
Hawlet Smart.
"Melton," answered the noble Sportsman, fanning himself with a
handkerohief.
"Ha! a hot favourite!" said Mr. J. H., hooking the tip. "Tre-
mendous heat!"
"Heat!" murmured the Captain. "It's equal to three
heats."
I don't know what most people thought of the bill of fare pro-
vided for our entertainment, but, personally I would, "on suoh a
night," to quote the Bard, rather have had selections from the
Robertsonian pieoes than the first Act of Bulwek's Money, and a
scene from Boccicault's London Assurance.
It was interesting and amusing enough to see Mr. John Clayton
as a Butler—very much " out of place "—and Mrs. John Wood, as a
Maidservant, chunked under the chin by Mr. Charles Wtndham,
who played Sir Frederick Blount as if he were first cousin of Lord
Dundreary. Funny, of course, was also Mr. David James, who
seemed to have forgotten a considerable amount of whatever he
might onoe have known of this part. But what did it matter? We
laughed, all of us. But criticism is out of the question on so excep-
tional an evening, and therefore I will suppose that all did their
best, and looked their best. I would rather have seen Mr. Hare as
Lord Ptarmigan, or Beau Farintosh than as Sir Harcourt Courtly,
and Mrs. Kendal as Dora, in Diplomacy, than as that very
theatrical Amazon, Lady Gay Spanker.
I should say that^ where all were so successful, Mr. Kendal's
"Yoicks! and who-hoop or Tallyho!"—or whatever the sporting
cries were that he gave vent to,—might have, as the slang goes now-
a-days, "taken the cake." It thrilled through Captain Hawlet
Smart, who, had it not been for the oppressive atmosphere, would
with difficulty have been restrained from joining in a shout so dear
to the heart of every true sportsman. The only person who seemed
to take it cool was Sir Henry Irving, as he stepped lightly on to the
stage and delivered himself of some most appropriate lines, written
by Sir Clement Scott—(in these days, when everyone is being
Baronetted or Knighted, it is so difficult to refuse a title to those
whose names seem to be exaotly formed to have a handle fitted to
them)—whereat all the house cheered, to be in return itself cheered
by the entrance of Sir John Lawrenck Toole, whose few words put
everyone in a better humour than ever.
Then the Curtain went down, and in a few seconds again arose,
showing a stage covered with floral trophies, telling, not as mere
flowers of speeoh, but in the very best language of flowers, of the
tribute of affectionate regard which everyone present felt for the
retiring Manageress. The Manager had to come forward alone, and
speak for himself and partner.
I felt inclined to say, "Don't he down-hearted, Sir! 'don't cry,
Mr. Cooke!' This is not good-bye, hnt au revoir!" and, after all,
there's not much to weep about in having finished work early, and
being able to retire in the very prime of life with a large fortune,
good health, and the best wishes of a vast number of genuine friends,
at a time when a majority of working men at the Bar, for example,
who have toiled and toiled, and bad to keep up appearances, are only
just beginning to get out of difficulties, and to know the luxury of
an increasing reserve-fund on deposit. Bless my dear pockets, I only
wish I had half the cause for. tears that my friend, Ex-Manager
Bancroft has, and I would weep for joy?
The Banchofts have done much for the Stage: in fact, the mise-
en-scene at the houses where Comedy is played, owes its present
completeness entirely to them. They, and Mr. Hare with them,
introduced the natural style of acting, thereby supplanting the
theatrical tone and gestures of the old school, whioh Burlesques had
done good service in laughing off our Stage for ever. I wish them
health, happiness, nil multos annos, and am theirs very truly,
Soft Nibbs.

GAMP REDIVIVA; OR, MUCH "OVER-RATED."
Wr-e-ew! where is my precious old pattens, and likewise my cotton umbrella?
And only jest let me get at him, that Randolph, that bragian fella!
Wioh I've stood it quite
long enough, drat him!
a saucy, owdacious young
scamp,
And now I mean giving him
toko, as sure as my name's
Saibey Gamp.
Eh? keep on my hair P
Don't tell me! It is time
the old woman spoke out,
Or the monkey will smash
up our Party afore we
know wot we re about.
FolleT him, indeed? Never!
No, Saibey is faithful to
men as is men,
But no young whipper-
snapper shan't rule in the
buzzum once sacred to
Ben.
Ah, he—bless bis curls!—
was a beauty, my Beaket,
the joy of my 'art,
Wich it makes the old
woman feel sniffy to think
of him, manly and smart;
But Randolph, a hover-
grown schoolboy, a cheeky
young sparrer, him dare
To stick hisself up as a Benj y P It's more than a mortial can bear!
They didn't ought never have let him, dear Sally and darling old Stafft,
Shove nose to the front, like a pup, just aoos he was cheeky and chaffy;
They ought to have snubbed him and smacked him, and made him go smartly to
heel,
Taught him never to snap at his betters, nor play with strange puppies, nor steal.
But they spoilt him with petting and fussing; old Sairey herself was to blame,
As did think him a sort of a new Bailey Junior, saucy, but game;
And now he has chucked us all over, and gone to the front like a shot,
And if Saibey don't wallop him off, why, the Party will go straight to pot.
But old Saibey will do it, oh, trust her! her baok and her pattens is up,
As ain't goin' to be gulled nor yet flummoxed by any seoh imperent pup.
Take on with them low Irish tykes like some Radical mongrel? No, no 1
Not while Saibey can handle her gingham. It's wus than that Brummagem Joe!
Wich there ain't, arter all, so much difference, not down at bottom there ain't,
But to see sich a leadin' our Party 'ud madden the soul of a Saint.
"Tory-demmycrat" sounds nice and harmless, but if it means simply cold scran
From the Rad's broken-wittel bag, drat it! far better the Libs' Grand Old Man!
He's a ohokin' off arf our best men, wioh his demygog trash they won't
swoller;
There's Whitley and Hamilton shied, and a lot more good fellas will foller.
Life and soul of the Party. Yah bah! If / let the young monkey alone,
It '11 soon have no life left at all, nor no soul it can dare call its own.
But no. I must oome to the resoue. I see it, I know it—I will.'
He ain't never yet had to face a Umbrella wot's handled with skill.
Wh-u-u-sh! Whack! If he don't drop his tail, and find all his smart
fireworks go damp,
When old Saibey is once on the job in good earnest, my name isn't GAMr!

TALES OF HOPE.
Lobd Salisbury (according to his Mansion House deliverance) hopes that
Russia and England may preserve the peace and mutual respect, that Egypt
may progress, that the population of this country may advance socially, that
struggles for class power may cease, "and, above all, that the City of London
may retain, undiminished and unimpaired, its ancient magnificence." Levia-
than and little fishes! My Lord Marquis, there seems a little lack of " moral per-
spective" here. A finer example of anti-climax was surely never produced, even
by a Peer, a Premier, or a Saturday Reviewer! Lord John Manners' famous
couplet is here outdone.
"Let nations fight, classes to contest stoop,
But leave us Ciyic Show and Turtle Soup!"
one might imagine your saying, if, like Lord Shebbrooke, you stooped to the
Weg-like weakness of "dropping into verse." Your "hopes," my Lord, do honour
to your head and your heart, but their order seems a little inverted. Surely,
surely that, "above all," must have been a slip of your eloquent tongue—on the
perilously greasy slopes of hyperbolical after-dinner eulogy.
Friendly Motto for the Candahar Railway (Russians and English).—
"Suum Sibi cuique."
VOL. LXXXLX. G
A (GARDEN) PARTY QUESTION.
The M.P.'s assembled on Parliament Hill,
At a swell Garden Party conducted with skill.
"Eh P Parliament, M.P.'s, and Party? Oh, dear!"
Sighs the reader. "I thought Dissolution was near."
Mr. Punch sympathises, but begs to explain
That this Parliament wasn't St. Stephen s again,
And that men sick of that may extend their most hearty
Approval to this—unpolitical—Party.
For you see Shaw-Lefevbe and Beam well, and Lloyd,
Bubdett-Coutts, Bodkin, Hubbard, and Bbyce were
employed,
Not in Party slang-whanging, such bricks quite beneath,
But in scheming extension to old Hampstead Heath.
The Parliament Fields and the Heath Park Estate,
If saved from the Ogres of brick, tile, and slate,
May be added thereto, if the price we '11 afford,
And can stir up that slow Metropolitan Board.
Mr. Punch thinks if this be not done, more's the pity.
He '11 do what he can do to help the Committee,
And holds that the people should leave nothing undone
To gain—whilst we can gain—a new lung for London.
He'd like, in long streets olose and weary to tramp, 's
stead,
More green bosky acres adorning old Hampstead.
All lovers of Nature and friends of " the childer"
Should baok Shaw-Leeevre in baffling the Builder!
THE QUEEN'S ENGLISH.
In the official Court Circular, describing the recent
Royal Marriage festivities, an apology was made for call-
ing Count Erbach Schoenbebg (whoever he may be)
Count Ebbach of Erbach-Schoenberg, and announcing
that Heb Majesty had been taking a drive with her
newest son-in-law instead of his brother. Such mistakes
as these are unpardonable; and to put the Public on its
guard for thef uture, it is as well to publish a table showing
the "fact" as shadowed forth by the Royal Record, with
the corresponding " real truth of the matter " :—
When the Court Circular says
that
The Queen rode on a
pony.
The Royal promenade was
before luncheon.
The Queen was accom-
panied by two Equerries.
The Princess Louise
called.
Prince Christian of
Sohleswig-Holstein stayed
to lunoheon.
The Grand Duke of Hesse
has arrived at Osborne on
a visit to Her Majesty.
The Duke of Teck and
the Marquis of Lorne have
been created Princes of the
Blood Royal.
The statement made in
several of the newspapers
that the length of the Arch-
bishop of Cantebbury's
charge to T.R.H. the Prince
and Princess Henby, caused
great annoyance to Heb
Majesty, the Prince of
Wales, and the rest of the
Royal Family, is incorrect.
That the reporting of
the domestic trivialities of
Court life does not render
Royalty supremely ridi-
culous.
It may be concluded tltat
Heb Majesty took a
drive in a Bath chair.
It was after that meal.
"On horseback" should
have been added.
The Princess Louise (Mar-
ohioness of Lobne) called.
Prince Christian of
Schles wig-Holstein stayed to
breakfast, twelve o clock
snack, luncheon, five o'clock
tea, dinner, and supper.
The Grand Duke of
Hesse, his family, his suite,
his friends, his uncles and
aunts, and. oousins and
cousins - german, have
arrived at Osborne on a visit
to Heb Majesty.
Neither the Duke of Teck
nor the Marquis of Lobne
have been created Princes of
the Blood Royal, a dignity
reserved solely for Prince
Henby of Battenberg.
The statement made in
several of the newspapers
that the length of the Arch-
bishop's chanre gave great
offence to Heb Majesty
and the Royal Family, is
entirely accurate.
That such reporting un-
doubtedly does.

(Ncttional Portrait Select Committee—Adjourned Meeting.)
The final light of the adjacent Inventions Exhibition having at length
been extinguished, the adjourned meeting of the above Committee was once
more resumed, the portraits assembling, as on the previous occasion, in the
upper lumber room attaohed to the Galleries. As soon as the hour of mid-
night had sounded on a neighbouring clock, the half-length of Sir Joshua
Reynolds, painted by himself, was, as before, voted unanimously into the
Chair, and the proceedings commenced.
The Chairman, who, on rising, was greeted with some feeble and faded cheers,
said that he was afraid that sinoe their last meeting, when they had assembled
hurriedly to discuss their narrow escape from destruction, owing to a con-
flagration in the three-and-nine-penny dinner department, with which their
destinies were so intimately associated—(laughter)—he had no very encouraging
information to submit to them. It was true that a " Mr. Plt/nkett" ("Sir John
Popham, Lord Chief Justice, 1531—1607. Painter unknown," with warmth,
"IVno's hef") made some statement the other night, to the effect that
"something was going to be done," but he, the Speaker, thought that by this
time they pretty well all of them knew what that meant. (Groans.) Their
immediate destination, he believed, was Bethnal Green. (Renewed groans.)
He understood that manifestation oi feeling. Every canvas in the room, how-
ever indistinct, realised that it was one thing to get into Bethnal Green, but
quite another to get out of it again. He therefore trusted that Borne suggestion
might be forthcoming, from the present meeting, to guide them as to what
steps they should oollectively take, he would not say for their comfortable,
hut positively for their deoent habitation in the future. (Subdued cheers.)
"Kino Edward the Third (tracing from a chapel fresco) " said, if he was
to give his opinion, he should vote at once for their removal bodily to The Hall
hy the Sea. (Cries of " Oh, oh.'")
Cardinal Polk (dimensions, 1 ft. 6 in. by 1 ft. 2 in.)" observed, that
l" ™>" — J—A in tli« PotnlniriiB " smaller than life." and only "seen to

account for his traoed Majesty's taste (laughter), but, as
far as he was personally conoerned, he would just as soon
be hung up in the Holborn Restaurant. (Sensation.)
"Dean Swift (1667—1745, by Charles Jervas)" said
that, though only represented in a blue silk dressing-
gown, he did not care where they put him, as long as it
wasn't in the hall of the New National Liberal Club.
(Murmurs from "the Gunpowder Conspirators, half-
lengths, A.D. 1605.") He nad no intention of intro-
ducing politics into the matter, but he would like to
remind the company that, as this was a purely artistic
question, they had very little hope, unless the "spleen
and spite of party" intervened, of getting any help
from any Government whatever. Their probable finale
would he a conflagration—perhaps even a mock auction!
—and, as there appeared to be a sort of perpetual
"Ranelagh"—or something—going on next door, he
voted that the Trustees be empowered to hang them up,
wherever they could find room for them, among the
coloured lamps. (Cheers.) Speaking for himself, he
should like to see the fun. (Laughter.) Certainly he
should prefer it to a return to Wardour Street.
"King Philip II. (1527-1598. Painted by Alonso
Sanchez Coello)" said that, many years ago, he had
passed (though the fact was not generally known) a con-
siderable time, in a shop-window in that locality, with
3*. 9d. in large chalk fieures, marked boldly across him.
(Roars of laughter.) He was usually taken for a bad
likeness of Macreadt as Hamlet, still—the experienoe
was by no means a pleasant one. Seeing that he was a
full-length portrait of some value, he thought he ought
to occupy Bome conspicuous position, if it were only
on the advertisement hoarding at Knightsbridge.
("Hear! hear!") If his personal taste were con-
sulted, he would like to be cut down, and end his
artistic days as a swinging sign at some quiet and retired
public-house. (Much laughter.)
"The Earl of Chesterfield (K.G.,3 ft. by 2ft. 2 in.)"
remarked that he strongly resented the intrusion into
family life which had dragged him, together with the
last speaker, from his ancestral Gallery to be damaged,
destroyed, and, finally, consigned to some East End
dust-bin by an unintelligent and parsimonious system
of government. If he had known how posterity would
have treated him for his literary feat, his now famous
Letters to his Son would in all probability have been
addressed, though in very different terms, to Mr.
Plunket himself.
[" The Five Children of King Charles the First, with
a large Dog, after Van Dyck," who had been for some
time interrupting the proceedings with unseemly behaviour,
were here turned out of the room amidst a good deal of
general merriment.']
Upon order being restored, the Chairman said he had
just received from his noble friend, " Charles Brandon,
Duke of Norfolk (K.G. 1485. Painter unknoum)," a
paper which he would read to the Committee. It was a
brief form of Advertisement for a suitable domicile to
accommodate them, that the noble Duke suggested should
be inserted in a couple of daily papers, and perhaps also
in one respectable weekly. It was as follows:—
TO THE BENEVOLENT AND ARTISTIC—RARE
OPPORTUNITY.—A Collection of National Por-
traits, which is about to leave its present situation
through no fault of its own, is anxious to meet with
some intelligent and appreciative caretaker who would
be willing to furnish it with a safe, convenient, and
appropriate home, in consideration of the prestige attach-
ing to association with a priceless accumulation of his-
toric memorials. The site should, if possible, be central
and generally accessible to the public; but a fitting,
secure, and suitable domicile would meet the present re-
quirements of the Advertisers. No objection to a good
airy County Lunatio Asylum where the pictures could
be hung well out of reach of the patient*. N. B.—No
communications can be entertained either from Travel-
ling Show Proprietors, Marine-Store Dealers, or existing
Authorities at South Kensington. Would be glad to
hear from a generous-minded Millionnaire a little off his
head on the subject of Art. Apply, personally or by
letter, to the Secretary of the Canvas Committee, the

meeting, it was unanimously decided that three insertions

of it should be sanctioned forthwith, when, after a vote of silent
thanks, proposed by Sir Godfrey Knelleh and seconded by a Dutch
gentleman, supposed, according to his own account, to nave been
responsible for the legs in the celebrated full-length of Sir Robert
Walpole, the assembled Portraits quietly separated, and, in the
now fast approaching daylight, noiselessly resumed their accustomed
places.
THE THAMES AND ITS TRIBUTARIES.
The tributaries of the Thames were once pellucid rills
And rivulets to the river that, descending from the hills,
Their tribute paid in current coin so fair, of former days,
That the "Silver Thames" in poesy was a stock and a standing
phrase.
But now such other tribute other tributaries pour
Into the Thames, that thence its flood like silver flows no more;
Rather a copper currency its turbid water seems,
Polluted for pellucid are its tributary streams.
The channels which Town Councillors their scavengers bid Hush,
On Thames's bosom disembogue large subsidies of slush.
The Thames derives such tribute from the sluices and the drains,
And riparian gasworks' gutters, rich of Kingston and of Staines.
Filtration frees the fluid of its odour and its hue.
Clears the coffee-coloured mixture, ere ye tea and coffee brew;
So the beverage that on Londoners each Company bestows
Gives the nostrils no offence, although 'tis paid for through the nose.
The liquid that Thames River with its tributaries yields
How meet withal to irrigate and fertilise the fields!
But oh, to tipple how unfit for e'en a thirsty dog,
Much more for any man to gulp or mingle with nis grog!
Oh, for some able engineer the tribute to arrest
Which tributaries, Father Thames, pour out upon thy breast!
Oh, for an Act of Parliament to moderate the price
Of water dear and nasty, and insure it cheap and nice!
Suitable Site fob a Police "Coukt."—The Area.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [August 8, 1885.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Souse of Lords, Monday Night, July 27.—Serene atmosphere
raffled to-night from unexpected quarter. Granville mightily
wrath. Considering what little publio practice he has, does it
exceedingly well. Ambled down to House to-day in most genial
mood. Hicks-Beach in other House woefully muddled business in
connection with Medical Relief Bill. Bill now come up to Lords;
Granville prepared to move Second Beading. When he arrives,
learns that Milltown has been before him. Had come down at
half-past three, sat on steps till doors were opened, and then rushed
in and given notice. Milltown been in House some fourteen years
now; never before distinguished himself. Name not known to
public; now suddenly emerges from obscurity, and, as Dunraven
Bays, brings out Pussy's claws.
"Milltown? Milltown?" says Granville, with apparent
effort to recollect such a personage. "Ah, Peerage of Ireland. I
know. Family motto, 1 Clarior e Tenebris.' Hitherto dwelt in the
clouds, but emerged at last. See if I can't extinguish him."
Effort in vain. AIilltown curiously obtuse. Has as much right,
he says, as anyone else to take charge of the Bill. Granville, in
despair, appeals to Ministers to say whether they ever heard of a case
like this. The Markiss stared straight ahead. Wasn't going to
commit himself. Couldn't very well back up Milltown, but not
inclined to gratify Granville. Cranbrook rushed in where
Markiss feared to tread; but that not thought enough. Cranbsook
a hot-headed person, will say anything.
"Don't you think you could say a word?" Markiss whispered to
the latest Earl.
"Oh, dear! oh, dear!" moaned our old friend, Stafford North-
COTE. "Thought there was an end of that. When in the Commons
had always to be getting up to justify Randolph, cover retreat of
Chaplin, or do something impossible. Came here for a rest, but
find it's the same old game. However"
So Iddesleioh got up, and endeavoured to show that Milltown
was quite right in adroitly forestalling Granville in taking charge
of a Liberal measure forced upon the Government in the other House,
and petulantly abandoned by them. Squabble lasted half-an-hour,
House finally agreeing, upon Motion put, that Milltown have pre-
cedence. Business done.—In Commons, Army Estimates.
Commons, Tuesday.—"There's one thing," said Callan to
Cavendish-Bentinck, "as I never can stand—that is, the use of
strong language. What I like is decency of behaviour in all rela-
tions of life. If a man's a gen'leman, let him behave as such. In
my humble way
I've tried to show
what a gen'leman
should be, and
though I Bay it
what shouldn't,
feel I may od
occasion come for-
ward to vindicate
the courtesies of
public life."
"Right you are,
Phil,'' said Ca-
vendish- Ben-
tinck. "you
stood by me nobly
the other night
when, in the in-
terests of public
morals, I spoke
out in the House
about those news-
papers; and I '11
stand by you
now; especially
as it's Bright."
Bright been
talking in his
frank way about
the Land - Lea
guers. Accused
them of obstruction, of bringing hideous charges against Spencer,
of vilifying the Judges, of accusing law-officers of packing juries,
and of "exhibiting boundless sympathy with criminals and
murderers."
_ " A breach of privilege!" cries Callan blushing with indigna-
tion to the tip of his nose.
"Very well," said Bright. "But is what I've said true?"

Muddled Moralists.
Goes through statements one by one; puts them to Parnellites,
who, after hesitation, decide to admit them, cheering every accusa-
tory sentence. This not quite what was looked for. Seems that
Callan, animated by most friendly motives, has chiefly succeeded in
finding opportunity for Bright to say over again with increased
force, and with added publicity, what he had uttered at the Spenoer
Banquet. Hicks-Beach, as usual, comes to grief. Tries to walk on
both sides of the road at once. Ashamed to support Callan's
Motion, but afraid of offending allies. Expresses regret at Bright's
language. This brings up Hartington, who speaks with unusual
animation. Doubted whether Callan had brought motion forward
with general assent of Parnellites. "I cannot believe," he said,
amid prolonged oheers, "that men who habitually allow themselves
such liberty—I may say licence—of speech, are the men to come
whining to the House to complain of adverse criticism."
"I assure the noble Lord, Windbag Sexton shouted after Mem-
bers, who hastily rose to leave when he appeared on the scene, "that
when we come to this House it will not be with a whine."
"Begorra no," says W. H. O'Sullivan, "it'll be wid a whiskey."
Randolph and Chamberlain had a little set-to, House forming a
delighted ring.
Three hours and half wasted upon this, after which the majority
of Members went to dinner, two or three remaining to work.
Business done.—Some Votes in Supply.

■ That's How it's Done.'
The Secretary for India pulls the string, and exhibits his Working Model of
a Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army to Mr. John Bull.
Wednesday.—" Got an idea for the empty frame-work for frescoes
in the Octagon Hall," said Plunket. "What do you think of The
Temptation of Joseph Oillis? Fancy it would make a capital
companion picture to St. George and the Dragon. Too late to get a
vote on the subject now; but next Session, as the humorist Beach
says, shall include Vote for it."
Certainly a striking incident. House in Committee ef Supply.
Only four Votes to get, but must be agreed to before quarter to six.
If not, Supply carried over to to-morrow, and prorogation delayed.
Talk on Irish Education Vote carried on till Five o'clock, Windbag
Sexton alone being inflated for nearly an hour. There remained
vote for South Africa, including controversial subjeots of Imperial
policy. Only three-quarters of an hour to deal with this, and,
beyond, vote for Post Office and for Monument for General Gordon.
When vote for Irish Education reached by process of exhaustion,
and Chairman just putting the question, Joey B. rose, and watched
with gleaming eye unhappiness of Hart Dyke as he prolonged
discussion. Then came the South African debate in progress at
eighteen minutes to six. Only three minutes of time, and three
Votes to pass! Hicks-Beach urged that debate should olose so as to
get Supply through Committee, resuming it on report if necessary.
Joseph Gillis moved uneasily on his seat, and a thrill of appre-
hension shook the frame of Henry Holland. If he got up and
spoke only for two minutes all was lost. He didn't interpose, and
South African Vote passed. Vote for Post Office put. Joseph half
rose, but didn't speak, and Vote passed. Vote for Gordon Monument

is the paragraph:—
"The Affairs of Mil Albert

Proclamation ordering the suspension of
business on the day of the funeral. The
Governor of New York has also requested
people to cease business on that day."

must have experienced a Eeene sense
of enjoyment on reading the above.

put, the last of the year's Supply. Hand of the clock was on the
quarter. A few words, charging Earl Spencer with being accessory
to the death of Gordon would suffice. Chairman hurried through
the formula of putting the Vote, and had just declared it passed,
when Joseph was discovered on his feet, with one thumb in armhole
of waistcoat, and the other signalling to Chairman. But it was too
late, the last Vote was through, and Joey B. resumed his seat.
_" You had a bad quarter of an hour," I said, to my friend. "How

"Held on with my hands to the bench," said Joseph, with melan-
oholy Bmile. "Couldn't have done it else. But am glad the thing
got through. A bargain's a bargain. They've behaved very well
to us, and I wouldn't like to be the man to spoil their sport. Only I
hope they won't try me so sharp again."
Business done.—Supply closed.

Mr. Sims Reeves {to comparatively youthful Profess
"Quite right to take a leaf out of my Upper-
yourself too cheap!"
Thursday.—No one looking down upon the Treasury Bench and
noting a young man Bitting respectfully among his elders would
~ ine what a firebrand it is. It is true that the young man treats
his moustache with unnecessary vigour, and that W. H. Smith, a
man of peace though at the head of the War Office, shows a nervous
disposition to induce Mr. Chaplin or Colonel Stanley (being
moderately plump persons) to sit between him and the Secretary
of State for India. These are, however, indications that must
be sought for to be observed. To the average looker-on there is
nothing in the appearance of Randolph that suggests reason for the
terror which fills the breast of Mr. Whitley as he looks in the
direction of the Treasury Bench, or that makes Claud Hamilton sit
in the Gallery as offering means for speedy retreat in case of need.
Fact is there's been terrible row. Randolph was to have gone
down to Liverpool yesterday to address public meeting; took it for
granted he was to be supported by Local Conservative Members.
Discovered at last moment they didn't mean to go; whereupon
explosion, disaster, and general break up of everything.
If they think they 're going to make a fool of me," said Ran-
dolph, "they're mistaken. They don't come to much when they
are put in one scale. I can get on without them, but they shan't
snub me. I won't go to Liverpool at all, that 'a fiat."
Nor did he. "He'll break us up, after all," said Sir Michael,
"after irretrievably ruining us before final stroke comes. Wouldn't
have sold Stafford Northcote if I'd foreseen this. All living in
state of terror. Don't know what a moment may bring forth. If
we could only get him to go and govern the Congo, now!"
Business done.—Medioal Relief Bill passed in Lords, Post-Ofiice
Bill in Commons,
Friday.—Wemyss had right good time of it to-night. In pro-
digious speech drew attention to nothing less than "the socialistic
tendency, character, and effects of the legislation of the last fifteen
years!" Majority of noble Lords immediately fled. Prime
Minister, obliged to remain, forlornly said, didn't know whether
the speech was a funeral oration upon the late Government, or an
expression of hope over the cradle of the new one. Granville
hinted that the speech had taken seven months in preparation.
"They may guess what they like, and think what they like,
Toby," said Wemyss, rubbing his hands, and smiling to himself,
"I've had a high old time. What's the use of the House of Lords, if
one oan't, from time to time, insist upon making long speech to it P"
Wolff not gone yet. In private letter Sdltan says,—" Am tired
of their crying ' Wolff! Wolff!' and none comes." The Special
Commissioner wandering in and out of House of Commons to-night,
vaguely, full of business. Lawson tells me it was Wolff who
wrote to-day's leader in Standard on Randolph. But I really can't
believe it.
Business done.—Criminal Law Amendment Bill in Committee.

THE "CLOTURE" AT LAST.
Farewell! Farewell! Shut up the well-

There comes a closing-hour to all below,
And Parliaments—thank Heaven!—are not
immortal,
The end is here; let us arise and go.
The end of five long years of sound and fury
Whose true significance time must unfold,
Fiery heroics worthy of old Drury,
And broad buffooneries of farceurs bold.
Long loud logomachy, eternal chatter,
Prolix polemic prosily sustained,
With a most plenteous pauoity of matter,
By foes Pantagruel-tongued and parrot-
brained.

The howl is hushed, and muffled is the cheer;
And echo unto echo no more calleth
In laughter loud or j ubilant "Hear! Hear!"

How many a day of fight have you looked on;
H"W many a night of tumult and disorder!

No more you'll hear the chilly chimes of

Clang through the oharivari of debate,
Hibernian talk-floods every barrier scorning,
Fierce foaming like a Highland stream in
spate.
Parnellian eloquence clear, cold, and steely.
No longer you will have to hear—or check,
Look up! Look up!

For you J! right's mellow periods have out-

And Gladstone, matched with peers, by

Has whelmed them all in floods of vocal gold.
And lo! the old order changeth. Demos

Nearer and nearer to the place of power;
The enfranchised mob the imperial purple

Or will "the old cause, the old name, the old
umbrella,"
Muster our British manhood once again?
Who knows? But here begins the ungauged
transition,
We 're standing at the parting of the ways;
Closing with custom old and old tradition,
Names of the past, and lights of other days.
We turn to face thefuture, steadfast, cheerful.
Old England's story is so full of change;
He hath mislearned its lessons who stands

Before the coming of the new and strange.

Of happiness and honour like the old.
But here one volume of her history closes,
One chapter of her chronicles is told.

The Parliament of Eighty's fled for ever.
Farewell, its ancient Warder! Close the

It was said lately by a French Senator that
France would be made "the Laughing-Stook

all large commercial and financial centres as
to the price at which this stock would be

within half an hour, but the quotations would
be more or less incorrect until authorised by
the old-established firm of Joe Mtt.t.ct &

SPORTING EVENTS.
Sis,—Coming events may cast their shadows before
them, but some events leave their gloomy shadows behind
them; and this is what Goodwood has done for yours,
truly.
The Prince and the Duke of Edinburgh retired within
the Plantation with a certain chosen friend, who shall,
out of motives of modesty and delicacy, be nameless—
though far from being really so, in fact—in order to eat
their Goodwood Steaks, and quaff the Goodwood Cup, in
the composition of "which brew some one I know, not a
hundred miles away from the present writer, iB absolutely
unrivalled. "0 Solitude, where are thy charms I" Not
in the Plantation at Goodwood; for scarcely had we—I
should say his Royal Highness, and His Royal Highness's
Royal Brother—sat down to pick a bit, than we were
surrounded by a swell mob of Bwell snobs, watching
every mouthful, and hardly repressing a murmur of
applause, when H.R.H. took a long deep pull at the Prize
Cup. And when H.R.H. winked over the top of it at the
Duke, and the Duke winked at their mutual friend, the
Nameless One, and when, from the expression of the
latter's countenance, it was seen by the orowd that there
was precious little—how little, yet how preoious!—left
for him, they were almost frantic with delight. And this
is what is called privacy for the Royal Party!
I am not in the humour to give the pubho any special
tips about the Leger, but let me tell them this, that if
anyone can be found to give the following prices for the
ST. LEGER—
300 to 1 agst Melton,
600 to 2 „ Xaintrailles,
200 to 1 „ Pepper and Salt,
800 to 4 „ Child of the Mist,
you don't hesitate, bnt take 'em all, specially if you can
get the odds in pounds to halfpence. Au revoir, or, as I
shall Bay the day before the Leger, a demain, or d St.

trick may yet be done by

"Fixtures for this Month" read out poor Habdup from
his sporting paper, and then observed sadly, "I'm one of

THE CONCERTS OF THE SEASON.
(A Musical Reporter's Growl.)
Oh! be joyful! For small mercies let us truly grateful be!
With which sentiment I think my weary colleagues will agree.
The distressing entertainments they have found so dread a bore
For some months to come, at least, will be imposed on them no more.
EVry pianist, ev'ry vocalist iB packing his portmanteau
To convey to other climes his "execution" or " bel canto,"
(What a joy to think of tenors out at sea when there's a breeze on!)
And we've heard the last, thank goodness' of the Concerts of the
Season.
Wealthy idle dilettanti, who for laok of aught to do
Lounge from concert-room to concert-room in quest of something new,
Have no notion of the agonies that critics such as I
Are compelled to suffer, vear by year, from April to July;
Of the pangs that are inflicted by the merciless sonata,
By the cruel old capriccio and the truculent toccata,
By the drivel set to musio, void of poetry or reason,
That are dinned into our ears throughout the Concerts of the Season.
Every matinee that's " patronised " by dead-heads who applaud
In return for their admissions, is no better than a fraud;
For, themselves unknown, its givers on the fame of others trade,
And the Artists on whose talent3 they depend are never paid.
But you hear them sing the same old songs—you see the same old faces
Reproduce the same old smiles and leers—the stereotyped grimaces
That remind you of a popular buffoon who has a " wheeze" on,
And enhance your detestation of the Concerts of the Season.
Ton are bidden to a Conoert in Park Lane or Eaton Square,
And what sort of entertainment do you have when you get there?
Certain ballads of the day, vociferated out of tune,
As, for instance, " Yours to-morrow," or " It cannot be too soon;"
Then, a pianoforte solo full of scrambles, and of thumps,
Long and wearisome enough to give an iron-clad the jumps;
And you loathe the Herr or Signor who disports himself the keys on
As the worst of your tormentors at the Concerts of the Season.
There's the noisome fantasia, that's spun out extremely thin,
By another gifted alien on a squeaky violin;
And the vile duet that ends with " Tra la la 1 we are so gay 1"
Which is always sung by sisters in a meekly stolid way;
The allegro and adagto and prestissimo con brio
Of that dismal soporific, the interminable trio,
In an interval of which your hat and stick you wildly seize on,
And escape, invoking curses on the Concerts of the Season.
If 'twere possible that I could be a Judge, let us suppose,
With the power to inflict whatever penalties I chose,
I'd imprison Ballad-Vocalists in dark and slimy vaults,
Instrumental Variations should be dealt with as assaults,
And the sentence I would pass upon inveterate offenders
Would be this—quite irrespective of their ages or their genders—
As an extra-heavy punishment for burglary or treason,
A compulsory attendance on the Concerts of the Season.
Just a Few Lutes.—Will there be a fusion of the London, Chat-
ham & Dover with the Brighton and South! Eastern Companies? As
"Two's Company and Three's none," if the S. E. is squared the
idea's a Bright 'un. All who love their Parisian jaunt, and their
luncheon at the Calais buffet en route, will thank Mr. J. 8. Forbes
for the two dailyservices starting and arriving at reasonably con-
venient hours. We devoutly hope that these "Daily Services " will
be religiously attended, especially on holydays. John Staat Forbes
ought not to be staatisfied until the L. C. & D. can do the distance,
giving the S. E. a start and a beating. The South Eastern does it
in about eight hours,—but there is no Calais buffet for the poor
sailor.

A LAY OF LAWN TENNIS.
(By a Laun-Tinny soniennc.)
With rackets poised against the foe,
We scorn the shining river;
Though other games may come and go,
Lawn Tennis lives for ever.
We roam the verdant lawn about,
Our skill seems unavailing;
For. sometimes in and sometimes out,
'Gainst fortune we are railing.
We chatter in our eager ways,
In merry girlish trebles;
We rush for many a ball that strays
Across the pathway pebbles.
We play upon the grassy plots,
The " Court" the garden covers;
We wear the blue forget-me-nots,
Like Tennyson's young lovers.
We skip, we slide, with many a glance,
As swift as eager swallows;
And as the gay balls bound and dance,
The ardent player follows.
We murmur when the stern net bars
The ball, we shake our tresses;
We've played beneath the moon and stars,
As many a girl confesses.
And how to "Bcrew" and "twist" we
know,
The "Service" too deliver:
For other games may come and go,
Lawn Tennis lives for ever.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAR1.

PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
I AS8I8T AT AN ARBITRATION.
S the Long Vaca-
tion approaches,
many of my
friends, whose
practice is larger
even than my
own, grow less
zealous in the
discharge of their
forensic duties.
This is certainly
so in the case of
Paddlecut, one
of the aforesaid
acquaintances
whose work is on
the largest pos-
sible soale. A
few days since
ray excellent and admirable Clerk ushered this prosperous individual
into my humble Chambers with the extreme deference that Porting-
ton always shows to those whose fee-book's annual total is said to
be written in more than three figures.
"The faot is," said my visitor, " I am in a hig Arbitration Case
that costs roughly a sovereign a minute. We have had over a
hundred days of it already, and shall have as many more. So as
there are sixty minutes in an hour, and we are supposed to be at it
from 10 till 4, you will see that at the rate I have suggested, each
sitting costs about £360. That's dear enough, isn't it?"
"Quite," I replied, "but what is the Arbitration all about, and
what do you want me to do in it P"
"As to what it's about that's more than I can tell you—I don't
think anyone knows—not even the Plaintiffs themselves. It's some-
thing about a building contract which failed or didn't fail, or wasn't
paid for, or was interrupted before it became completed, or something
or other like that. Then matters were complicated because there
was something wrong in the soil or specification, or preliminary
investigation, or agreement, or something of that kind. Now, as to
yourself. All you will have to do is to take a note, and if they
want you to do anything, why there '11 be heaps of people to tell
you what to do. I have an important engagement at Henley."
Thus instructed, I arrived the next morning at the Royal Courts
at ten sharp, reflecting that if the Arbitration cost a sovereign a
minute, it was of much importanoe that no time should be wasted.
I found that one of the apartments usually occupied by a Judge with
or without a Jury, had been most kindly placed at the disposal of
those interested in Long and Underpin v. The Improved Palace
and People's Country-Seat Building Society. The janitor at the
glass-door allowed me to pass on my explaining who I was, and I
entered. To my intense distress, on looking at the dock I noticed
that it was ten minutes beyond the hour, so that if the Court had
been waiting for me, I had already cost somebody two five-pound notes.
I was relieved to discover that this was not the case, as, besides a
most genial old Gentleman oocupying a chair immediately beneath
the Benoh (who apparently was talking to a friend seated beside him)
and a few Solicitors' Clerks, I was the sole occupant of the Hall of
Justice. By degrees, however, the barristers benches received
recruits—" stuff and "silk," but both in mufti.
"I do not wish to hurry you, Gentlemen," said the amiable vete-
ran seated beneath the Bench, who, it now appeared, was no less a
person than the Arbitrator, "but I think I should call your attention
to the fact that it is nearly eleven, and we have not begun."
All the Counsel were most anxious to impress upon the Arbitrator
that everything was being done with as much expedition as possible.
"That I do not doubt for a moment," replied the veteran with
extreme courtesy. "And now, if you please, we will get to business."
Upon this a diligent searoh was made for the Witness who had been
under examination on the previous day, and who now consequently
was ready to be cross-examined. The Witness being found, tbe
Counsel who was to question him was secured, and taken in hand by
several legal advisers, who oonsulted with him as to the proper queries
that should be put. The pile of exhibits finally having been ascer-
tained to be in good working order, a start in real earnest was made.
This was satisfactory, remembering the pound-a-minute calculation.
"Let me see, you have told us so-and-so, and so-and-so," began
the Cross-examiner. The Witness nodded assent,
there an exhibit which shows the level P"
The Witness and the Arbitrator thought there was.
others.
"I think it was marked 99," said the Witness.
"I am under the impression it was 57," observed a Counsel re
motely connected with the case, in courteous correction.
'Well, isn't
So thought
The Witness (equally oourteons) had no doubt but that " 57" wot
the number. Then a search was made among the exhibits, and " 57"
was found. It was not the right number, so "99" was tried and
turned out to be correct. Upon this all parties smiled triumphantly
at one another, and paused for a few moments to recover from their
exertions. Again I thought of the pound-a-minute calculation.
"Now," said the Cross-examiner, peering into the plan with savage
earnestness, "you say that the level is shown here, and he pointed
to a spot in the plan.
"No," returned the Witness, "it is here." And then he added,
politely, "But, pardon me, you are looking at the chart upside down.
This is the top."
The mistake having been rectified, the cross-examination was
cautiously continued.
"Well, the level was below the mud?"
At this point the Arbitrator, who had been following the proceed-
ings until now with rather perfunctory attention, became gently
excited, and seemed to take a personal interest in the mud.
"I suppose it is shown here?" he said, to the Witness, adding
something technical about the "marsh level," which tended to
prove that he knew all about it, and was doing his duty nobly.
"Has not this spot been photographed P" asked the Cross-
examiner, after a few moments of consultation with his clients.
Then the "number game "recommenced, and guesses were made
at the proper exhibit. On being ultimately found, it afforded some
disappointment, as there was a difficulty in recognising in the picture
the relative positions of mud, trees, water, and nouses.
Of course all this took some time, and no one was sorry when the
usual adjournment for luncheon occurred. Summing up the morn-
ing's work, I found, on referring to my notes, that just three
questions had been asked and answered; but this, of course, did not
include the queries as to charts and plans, which were much more
numerous.
"Quite a gallop to-day," said one of the Solicitors, as we left the
Conrt. "If we can only keep this rate up, we Bhall break the neok
of the oase before Christmas!"
After the refreshment interval (which I spent in the Bar dining-
room, a sort of vault that might have served equally well for a
workhouse kitohen or a military prison) I returned to my seat, and
was soon followed by the other interested parties.
Once more the cross-examination commenced with its accompani-
ment of plans, photographs, and the like, and again the Counsel
received further instructions before putting every new question. It
reminded me of a game of chess played by one individual against a
number of others acting in concert. After every answer of the
questioned the questioner and his assistants conferred as to what
snould be the next query. It was distinctly slow and monotonous,
and, at a pound a minute, seemed rather expensive.
With my left hand resting on a pile of legal authorities that 1 had
brought into Court with me on the chance of requiring them, I some-
what lazily jotted down a precis of the proceedings. Suddenly the
Cross-examiner addressed the Arbitrator in quite a new tone.
"Sir," said he, "I cannot help feeling that all we have been
doing this morning and for many days before this morning is a farce,
and nothing but a farce. The general impression of the public is
that arbitration is cheaper than law. It is nothing of the sort, Sir,
it is merely a dear and slovenly way of getting justice administered
without a trained Judge and an intelligent Jury."
"Really, this is very indecent!" exclaimed an opposing Barrister.
"Surely this inquiry has been conduoted on the pleasantest possible
terms. We are all a happy family."
"We are!" admitted the first speaker, "we are! But on public
grounds I consider the system pernicious. But I do not say this to
cause strife. I merely mention it, as I can now see a way of
bringing the suit to a highly satisfactory conclusion. I am in a
position to state that the Plaintiffs, Messrs. Loko and Underpin,
have proposed to and been accepted by the ladies representing the
Defendant Company—two charming and accomplished Nieces. The
cause, consequently, is at an end."
"Hallo!" said a voice near me, which I immediately recognised
as Paddlkcct's. "Just returned from Henley! You are making a
nice row in your sleep 1"
"In my sleep!" I exolaimed. "What do you mean P"
I looked round. Certainly the Court had resumed its usual calm,
colourless appearance. The same Witness was still being cross-
examined in the same leisurely fashion, the same Counsel was yet
again consulting with the same clients before putting the same sort
of query.
"But," I exolaimed, "there is to be a marriage I"
"Nonsense 1" replied Paddlecut. "Why, what are you thinking
about P"
"Why, that Long and Underpin v. The Improved Palace and
People's Country Seat Building Society is settled."
"That settled!" exclaimed Paddlecut; "why, it will last for
years! You must have been dreaming!"
And I had! A. Briefless, Junior.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE OYSTER AND THE GROUSE.

Oh a sweltering August afternoon,
As the Speaker dismissed the House,
A Native OyBter wept on the breast
Of a sympathetic old Grouse.
"Pity me, comrade," he sobbed, "for
deep
My mental anxieties are;
The dredging season commenced last
week.
Though this isn't a month with an R!
"In days less cruel and greedy than
these
I was Bafe while the Dog-Star shone;
I could fatten in peace and dreamily
gape
My subaqueous bed upon.
I could slumber, lulled by the lapping
ware,
Through the heat of an August day,
Or, whistling softly, the gambols watch
Of my innocent spat at play.
"But a law, which I cannot hesitate
To denounce as a licence to crime,
Permits the vile dredger to hyke me up
Just a month before my time.
This savage, indecent, gluttonous haste
To deprive me of life is due
To the basest of human propensities,
From the Oyster's point of view."
"Be of good comfort!" the Grouse
replied,
"My griefs are as great as thine;
The month that endangers thy precious
life
Is fatal to me and mine.
For our enemy, Man, at this time of
year,
Is bent upon shooting me down,
That he may devour my roasted re-
mains
At dinner with crumbs fried brown.
"The summertide through he has
chuokled with joy
To hear I was hardy and Btrong;
In the House, as the deadly Twelfth
drew nigh,
The debates he has deemed too long;
And now that the Session's chatter is
done—
A marvel of wasted breath—
He is off with his dogs and gillies and
gun
To the Moors, to compass my death
""We are one in our perils, my mollusc
friend,
We are one in our family woes,
For our toothsome bodies are coveted
now
By greedy, unscrupulous foes.
Who gloat on our fatness in leaders and
'pars'
With outbursts of fiendish glee,
And lick their lips at the hideous
thought
Of swallowing thee and me 1"
"A curse upon science!" the Oyster
exclaimed,
As the tears his cheeks ran down,
"On the locomotive that brings us up
fresh
To the gormandising Town!
On the newspaper ghouls,—when I
think of them
I can never choose but weep,—
Who revel in gruesome forecasts that
we
Shall abound this year, and be cheap!"
Thus sadly, that August afternoon,
The Oyster did wail and whine.
While the brilliant eye of the Grouse
was dimmed
With unfamiliar brine.
But he who heard them lament was
glad,
And a smile illumined his face.
As he prophesied, "Natives a penny
apiece,
And Grouse at three shillings a
brace!"
The Outgoing Government to the Speaker.—" Mori-tories te salutant.'"
PAGES FROM A DIARY
Kept by the Acting-Assistant, Deputy Sub-Editor of the.
Official Court Circular,
Susdat.—There are so many important faots omitted
from the daily record of Royal doings with which I
have the honour to be connected, that I nave determined
to make them public. For instance, although the Circu-
lar gives the name of the happy Divine selected for the
enviable distinction of preaching before Her Majesty
and the Royal Family, no mention is made of the cha-
racter and effeot of his sermon. It was twenty minutes
long, and during the first quarter of an hour every
occupant of the Queen's Pew was awake. It was only
during the last five minutes that two Princes and a
Princess (whose names are suppressed for obvious reasons)
Blumbered.
Prince Christian of Schleswig-Hoi stein (who stayed
to luncheon) expressed much satisfaction with " vinegar-
jam," a new sort of pickles, which H.R.H. has recently
invented.
Monday.—The Circular, although announcing the fact
that the Queen and Princess Beatrice took a drive in the
morning, omitted to mention that Spot, the favourite
oolley of H.R.H., was in attendance.
H.R.H. Prince Henry of Battenberg spent a large
portion of the morning in learning ten pages of How to
Speak English in a Fortnight, by Professor Sauerkraut,
or Berlin.
Prince Christian (who stayed to lunoheon) expressed
much approval of a ten-pound pot of pdte de foies gras
which had the honour of supplying H.R.H.'s entire meal.
Tuesday.—The Queen and the Princess Beatrice took
a drive in a pony-carriage. The Circular omitted to
mention that the Mistress of the Robes was accommodated
with a seat on the box.
Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein (who stayed
to luncheon) was graciously pleased to express his ap-
proval of the soup, fish, roast beef, and curried rabbit.
Wednesday.—The Prince and Princess of Wales took
a crnise in their yacht, the Aline, accompanied by T.R.H.
the Dukeand Duchess of CoNNAUGBT.the Princess Louise,
the Prinoe and Princess Henry of Battenberg, Prince
Christian of Schleswig-Holstein (who came on board in
time for five o'clock tea), Prinoe and Princess of Batten-
berg, T.S.H. the Count and Countess Von Pumper-
nickel, Baron Rumfelstifktn, Baron Stultz, Count
Von Hombogs, Prince SpoonNickkl, Baron Prog, and
the Marquis of Lorne. A large number of Ladies and
Gentlemen of the Court were also honoured with an
invitation. Owing to a breeze springing up, some of the
oompany were accommodated with places on an accom-
panying Hyde and Portsmouth steamboat. The hand of
the Royal Marine Artillery were in attendance.
Prince Christian of Sohleswig-Holstein (who stayed to
luncheon), expressed his approval of a superb dish of
liver and bacon, a plat specially prepared for H.R.H.
Thursday.—This being the forty-first birthday of the
Duke of Edinburgh, H.R.H. called upon the Prince and
Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Connaught,
the Duchess of Albany, the Princess Louise, Marchioness
of Lorne, the Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein
(who was not at home), and a large number of H.R.H.'s
friends and acquaintances. The birthday presents ac-
cepted by H.R.H. were more numerous than costly, with
the exception of those offered by the Royal household,
which were of the value sanctioned by precedent.
Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein (who stayed
to luncheon), was the only member of the Royal Family
present at that meal. H.R.H. graoiously shared the
viands prepared for the members of the Royal Household.
Friday.—Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein (who
stayed to luncheon), inspected the Royal Kitchen, and
spent a considerable time in examining the wine-cellars
and larder, graciously testing their contents.
Saturday.—Prince and Princess Henry of Battenberg
accompanied one another to-day (the first time this
week), for a walk. Two ladies and three equerries (on
horsebaok) were in attendance. In the afternoon His
Royal Highness proceeded to London,while the Prinoess
accompanied Her Majesty in a closed tpony carriage,
to mate some purchases in Ryde. The weather wag
inclement.
Prince Christian of Sohleswig-Holstein (who stayed
to luncheon), is suffering from indisposition.

OUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
These hasn't been for some time a better number of Macmillan's
English Illustrated Magazine than this one for August. Some of the
illustrations are charming.
Beneath the Dark Shadow is the first instalment of a tale intended,
like the Fat Boy's story, to make your flesh creep. Dropping into
verse, we may say,—
The English Illustrated Magazine
Is the cheapest that ever was seen;
'Tis published eaoh month by the far-famed Macmillan.
It only costs sixpence, though well worth a shillun'.
In the Fortnightly there is an article whioh we have read with
great interest. It is on " The New Naturalism," and its Author is
a Lilly, not the Jersey Lily, but Mr. W. S. Lilly. Far as most
Englishman will go with him in his estimate of Gorgon-Zola, yet
I doubt whether eminent Surgeons, on the vivisectionist side, will
allow some of his general assertions to pass unchallenged. Mr.
Punch, whose tender heart bleeds at the idea of injuring even a
black-beetle—ugh!—is in favour of Viviseotion under certain
stringent restrictions. If he were sure that he could confer on the
whole human race, by vivisecting Toby, such an inestimable boon as
would make the performance of that painful operation a solemn and
sacred duty, then, with Toby's consent, but not without, he would
sacrifice his own feelings, ana offer up Toby at the shrine of humanity.
"What's .the next article?" Oh, a most interesting one on the
Newspaper Press in Paris.
In the same magazine Dr. Morrel Mackenzie's Rejoinder to Dr.
Donkin—an unfortunate name, so suggestive of, "if I had a Don-
ets what wouldn't go "—is brilliant and instructive. It introduces
us to a "tabulating Laryngologist who has indioated the prophy-
lactio," and who calls gout1' the refuge for the destitute diagnos-
tician." Then Dr. Mackenzie playfully terms the stomach and the
liver "scapegoats." It is quite a happy thought. "0 my lungs
and liver! 0 goroo, goroo!" Henceforth let the sufferer say,
"I've a pain in my scapegoat;" or, "I think my scapegoat isn't
acting properly," and bo forth. Dr. Donkin,
Though in a frenzy
With Dootor Mackenzie,
has our best thanks for .having given the Rejoindering One such a
first-rate chance.
PROOF VERY POSITIVE.
The following extract from the Times of the 4th inst. tells
its own simple, yet mysterious tale, in a manner whioh argues such
exceptional powers of weighing evidence on the part of the Reporter,
that Mr. Punch would suggest that gentleman's immediate promo-
tion to the Bench. He would, however, very much like to know
what passed while the strange man Biggs was "put back?" How
suggestive of a shilling story and title 1 With the present sequel of
Mrs. Biggs " looking after Biggs" especially, think of itl
"At the Thames Police-court, Thomas Bioos, an elderly, gentlemanly-
looking man, was charged on his own oonfession with causing the death of
his vifr. Medical and other evidence having been given, Mr. Lushinoton
had the prisoner put back, and in the afternoon his wife attended the court,
which clearly proved there teas no foundation for hit statement, and on her
promising to look after her husband in future, Mr. Lushinqton discharged
But who gave evidence that the person calling herself Mrs. Biggs
was the Mrs. Biggs in question f Herself or her husband P How-
ever, if the Reporter was satisfied—he was there, and we weren't—
that's everything—or nearly everything.

"Richardson's

performances 1
Those of the North
Metropolitan Tram-
cars Co. seem to be
very hard lines. Mr.
Richardson, the
Chairman, did his
best to show it was
all right—more or
less. Bat Muster
Richardson's Show
wasn't quite satis-
factory all round as
it might have been,
specially when the
Pali-Mall Gazette
ferret went to work
to get at the truth
about Tram-cars.
Over fourteen hours
a day is a pretty good
dose of it;and, if
this is absolutely
the case, then the
Tram-car man's lot
is not a happy one.
Adapting an old
song of the over-
worked slavey — it
was Caliban who
sang it in a Bur-
lesque, by the Bro-
thers Brocoh, in
The Tempest, before
such liberties taken
with the Bard
shocked the dainty

oar man might well
sing —
"From morn to night I

this state of things
will rapidly improve,

[From a Bandolphian point of view. Suggested by Mr. Harding Cox's well-known Picture.)
If the slaves of the Tram-car complain of their
fourteen and a half hours of labour" in the open air"
which their Chairman seemed to consider quite an
attraction, what will be thought of the Jew tailors in
the East End, who, daring the busy season, are com-
pelled, according to an article in the P. M. G., to
work sixteen hours a day, and this in anything but the
open air. They get daring this time two pounds a week.
But not afterwards. The" banters" toil from seven
a.m. to midnight. The basters are those who keep
them at it, poor basters! And the "pressers" some-
times earn seven shillings a day, and tbey work till
midnight too. We pity the pressers, and should like
to tackle the oppressors.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, August 3.—" We are all enjoying
our Bank Holiday," said Boubke, just now, in explanation of reason
why certain Papers were not published.
Quite true: only, like our forefathers known to Fboissabt, we are
taking our pleasure sadly. House not very full, and everybody dead
beat.
"Most curious thing," said Christopher Syxis, worn almost to a
shadow with unremitting attendance upon Parliamentary duties,
"that we should
make Bank
Holiday for all
the world, only
omitting our-
selves. Why
shouldn't Hon.
Members have
their Bank Holi-
day like other
working-men f"
"Yes," said
the Sage of
Queen Anne's
Oate, "why
shouldn't they
go off on an ex-
cursion thirteen
to a horse, seek
the cool glades
of_ Epping, or
drink from what
Shebbrooke
calls 'airy
bowl' in 'Appy
'Ampton? Why
shouldn't they,
as they come
home, stop at
every public-
house? Why
shouldn't they

fill the streets with brawls when they reach Town, storm the publio-
houses at half-past twelve, beat their wives by way of greeting, wake
in the morning with a headache that only more drink will cure, and
resolve at least to make half a week of it? Why should there
be one law for the poor and another for the rich? And why
should both Houses of Parliament be debarred from the innocent
joys and pleasures provided by Lubbock for the great body of the
tolling masses?"
However, it's no use fighting against the law, and instead of
taking a day in the country with the rest, here we are slaving away
at the Criminal Law Amendment Bill. Got this through Committee
by Ten o'Clock; took up Scotch Secretary Bill, upon which Lyon
Playfair delivered luminous speech, in course of whioh, he observed
that duties of proposed new Secretary were "like a Haggis."
"Yes, but what's a Haggis like? said Ashukad-Babtlett, still
athirst for information.
Playfair very properly took no notice of interruption. A man
who didn't know a Haggis when he met one, was not worth devoting
attention to.
Tuesday, 5'10 A.M.—Going home with the Milkman, havine spent
cheerful night with the Irish Labourer. Passed Bill through Com-
mittee. Don't know what it's about. Understand it's meant to
help Parnellites in coming General Eleotion. Anyhow, they insisted
upon proceeding with it to-night, and of course we had to stay.
Might have got horns twenty minutes ago, only for Infants' Bill.
Don't know what this Bill was about, either. Joseph Oillis says
he believes it 'a a Bill to Put Down Infants, but isn't sure. Bbiggs
looking in in the early morning, as is his custom, found Hart Dyke
asleep on two chairs in library, exhausted with the Irish Labourer.
"What's the matter now? Dyke asked, waking when division-
hell clanged.
"An infant crying for the light,
An infant crying in the night.
And with no language but a cry," said Bbioos.
"Take it out of that," said Dyke, handing Bbioos a box of wax
matches, and, turning over on his side, was fast asleep again.
Business done.—Up all night, winding up business.
Tuesday Night.—Ireland again, with small hours of the night
given up to Scotland. Parnell baok after mysterious disappearance
of over a week. Understood he was away trying some fresh experi-
ments with his hair. Quite expected to see him come in with'orown
shaved and hair otherwise cropped close. But adheres to earlier
style of Oscar Wilde. Whispered among the Boys that he's taken
an oath neither to shave or cut his hair till Joseph Gillis is made a
Baronet.
"Why," he asks, "should Randolph get something for all his
men, whilst I have nothing to bestow? Joseph Gillis shall be a
B.B.K. Tim Healy shall be Attorney-General for Ireland; and as
for Sexton, he shall be appointed Commissioner to Chili, or some other
plaoe where it will take nim long time to go out and baok. Not
going to have Randolph crowing over me!"
At midnight House in Committee on Scotch Fisheries Bill. De
Worms in charge.
"Oh 1" said O'Shea, looking in, and preparing to leave imme-
diately. "Worms and Fishing. How appropriate. Ground-bait,
I suppose?"
"No,"said Ramsay, wondering how he could make such a mistake;
"Sea-Fisheries."
Business done.—Several Bills advanced.
Wednesday.—Appropriation Bill on. On this Motion all kinds of
subjects may he discussed. O'Bbien took opportunity of calling
attention to letter purporting to have been written by Erbtngton to
Granville on the subject of appointment of Arohbishop of Dublin.
Ebbinqton made capital and convincing reply. "How did the
letter come into O'Bbien's hands? It was either a forgery or was
stolen." More than this the new " barnet," as O'Bbien calls him,
declined to say. Joseph Gillis, with most judicial air, expressed
his opinion that Ebbinqton had given no answer "because he reelly
had none." But, on the whole, O'Bbien probably sorry he spoke.
Not a nice thing to be fixed with alternative, however blandly put,
of endeavour to make use of a letter that is either forged or stolen.
Honours of debate remained with Pat O'Bbien. In very best
oratorical manner, and mind full of glowing thoughts, after giving
his opinion on the Errington affair, Sir Pat deviated into disquisi-
tion on the new Tory Democracy. Thenoe, naturally led into review
of the history of the Mabl-
boboughs, with respect to
the historical tergiversa-
tion of the founder of the
family. Sir Pat was in-
flexibly just. '' One day ,"
he said,'' this dncal family
were followers of Wil-
liam. Another day they
were followers of James.
"But," he continued, in
a voice of thunder, "we
have had a woman in Eng-
land— a Sabah—and I will
ask whether the Sabah
of former days has fallen
away, and whether there
ought not to be in the
present day a feminine
descendant of the great
dnkedom of Marlbo-
rough?" All this Sir
Pat uttered, with his eye
resting upon Randolph,
whose presence had evi-
dently inspired this flight
of eloquence. House
roared with laughter. Ramsay seriously puzzled.
"What's the man at ?" he asked Sir GeobgeBalfoub. "What's
the Duke of Marlborough to do with the letter from Ebbinqton to
Granville, that O'Bbien says he's got; and who's Sarah? The
man's clean daft, and what people are laughing at I don't know."
The flood of Sir Pat's eloquence stopped by accidental dropping
into bad language. Gliding naturally from the Great Sarah to
question before the House, drew graphic picture of Attorney-General
for Ireland kissing O'Brien on both cheeks, and asking him to
attaok " those damned Whigs." Speaker, trying to look as if he
hadn't been laughing, gravely interposed. Sir Pat, knowing he'd
put his foot in it, hastily withdrew the remark, and presently brought
remarkable oration to a close.
"I do not," said Randolph, "know a more delightful or interest-
ing speaker than Sir Patrick O'Bbien. When he rises to address
the House he has no notion of what he is going to say; and when
he sits down his audience have not the least idea of what he has
meant to say."
Business done.—Appropriation Bill read Third Time.
Thursday.—Couldn't make out the other day what Randolph was
at. "Toby, old man," says he, "wish you'd look up in MangnaWs
Questions, or somewhere else, how many Viceroys there are. I'm
busy with these Indian figures, and don't want to get mixed."

"Can find only three," I told him later. "There's Ireland, India,
and Canada."
"Dear me," says Randolph, "only three|! And I've gone and
used one up already. However, must make the beBt of what
remains."
This all dark to me at the time. Understand it now. Randolph

Randvtfee Jabberanwakabhoy (the new Indian " Chef," addressing Lord
M-rt-ngl-n). "I think, Sahib, I 've made it hot enough for you r"
understood. When he got to end, Randolph took off his coat, care-
fully folded it up, put it down on seat behind, frowned on Grand
Cross to let him know he'd better not be up to any larks when his
back was turned, rolled up his shirt-sleeves, and went for Lord
RrpoN.
Nobody expeoted this, least of all Ripon, who at the moment was
placidly dressing for dinner.
"Ha! Ha I" cried Randolph, dancing round stuffed figure of
ex-Viceroy. "Clumsy!" (and he bunged up one eye). "Stupid!"
(and he fetched him one on the conk). "A crime!" (the other eye
closed); "and a blunder " (final blow laid ex-Viceroy on his back).
All this of course in a Parliamentary sense.
"I think that rather astonished them, Tout," he said, after it was
all over. "Fun of it was, they never thought what was coming.
Worst of it is, I'm using them up so fast, and supply strictly limited.
Knocked over two Viceroys within a week. Shall save up Lonsdale
for a bit."
Business done.—Indian Budget brought in.
Friday.—A quiet night. Very few here, and these in low spirits.
Criminal Law Amendment Bill being discussed, with one eye on the
Housing of the Working Classes Bill. If Criminal Law Amendment
Bill were disposed of before half-past twelve, t'other would come on.
But if talk can be kept up till 12 30, must stand over. So opponents
of the Housing of Working Classes Bill talked at length on Criminal
Law Amendment Bill up to half-past twelve. When clock struck
half hour, talk suddenly collapsed. Criminal Law Amendment Bill
passed; Housing of the Working Classes Bill passed over. That's
how we sometimes do work iu the House of Commons.
High Lite Bklow-Stairs.—A large Clook, with Westminster
Chimes, was presented to the Princess Beatrice by the Queen's and
Her Royal Highness's " dressers." Very nice of the dressers; what
did the kitchen-table send?
Vert Simple Remedy.—"Cannot something be done," Truth
asked last week "to stop the perpetually recurring 'suioide from
Highgate Archway'?" Certainly. Take down the Archway.
Off the Stage.—When an inimitable Actor has retired, anyone
may abuse him, in his absence of course, without fear of contradic-
tion, because there will be no one to take his part.
An eminent Theologian said he was perfectly acquainted with the
Summa of St. Thomas, but he had never heard of "St. Martin's
Summa." This Theologian has much to learn.
HIGH-SKY-HIGH COMPLIMENTS.
"The Emperor, determined to do fitting honour to his august visitor, not
only ordered the celebrated old Prussian family dinner-service, and Bococo
dessert plates to bo brought hurriedly from Berlin, but had every picture,
excepting only those of the Austrian Kaiser and his fair Consort, much to
the surprise of the attentive proprietor of the Badeschloss, ruthlessly swept
from the walls of his temporary drawing-room."—Gastein Correspondent.
En suite.—From a Distinguished Invalid's Diary.
9 a.m.—Took the waters. Feel as fresh as ever. Fanoy calling
this place Ifarf-Gastein! I call it good Gastein, and the more gas
turned on the better.—N.B. I '11 keep that joke for the gala dinner
this afternoon. That reminds me. Must receive him becomingly.
Will go and see what sort of quarters they have given him at the
Straubinger.
10 a.m.—Have had all the matting, bedroom-carpets, and oil-eloth
taken up, and have telegraphed to Potsdam for the Great Frede-
rick's Imperial sheeting. Have also ordered front of Hotel to be
painted Prussian blue, picked out with Hapsburg eagles, and the
Waiters and Proprietor to appear at breakfast in the fall-dress
uniform of the 73rd Pomeranian Radetzki Dragoons. Think that 's
neat. Walk back, wearing a Hungarian leopard-skin wraprascal,
and am heartily cheered.
11 a.m.—Don't half like the look of the entrance-hall and stair-
case. Have telegraphed to Potsdam for two dozen double-lounged
dos-d-dos Imperial ottomans, and for the great chandelier from the
Opera-house at Hamburg. Dear me—here they are 1 and I've not
yet picked out my uniform. I think a Silesian Grenadier Drum-
major (drum and all) will surprise them. Capital idea I I '11 try it.
»•••*•
2 p.m.—They have come, but owing to Francis-Joseph being
disguised, which I didn't expect, as a trumpeter of the White Cuir-
rassiers (Bismarck's Own) in undress, I embraced the coachman by
mistake. This has produced a splendid ovation, but hope it won't
affect the money market. Empress Elizabeth very gracious.
Offered her a complete set of ball-room curtains from Babelsberg.
Pleased, I think, and surprised. Ha! here's dinner.
• *••••
6 p.m.—Dinner great success. Compliment implied in family
soup-tureen almost seen without explanation. Dessert over. Have
put on several loose Austrian sabretashes, and insisted on walking
over and seeing them off. Crowd enthusiastic. Empress still
charming. Promised her a dozen loo-tables and the whole of the
fourth-storey furniture at Stolzenfels. Francis-Joseph unrecognis-
able as a North German Port Admiral. However, directed by Thun,
managed to embrace him this time. Off at last. Excitement quite
affecting. Save sent soup-tureen and two potato-dishes after them
by special courier on horseback. Everybody touched to hysterics.
To the Badeschloss again by a back way quietly. Interesting day.
OFFICIUM CUM DIGNITATE.
The ever glib and youthful Secretary of State for India, the other
day in his place in Parliament, solemnly, and with a serious sense of
his responsibility as a Minister of the Crown, described the necessity
he was under of introducing a Budget with a deficit of a million and
a half, as "hard lines." Here are some more handy and elegant
phrases for him.
Reply to a late Indian Secretary, who has charged him with im-
perilling the destinies of the Empire by a persistent pursuance of his
present policy.—Yah I get out! You 're another!
Peroration of stirring and patriotic speech insisting on the para-
mount value of India as an integral portion of the British Empire.
—Now mind, no error. I tell you what it is: the Country has got a
pot of money on it 1
Specimen of satiric political threat addressed to aged Members of
the Front Opposition Bench who have intimated their intention of
prolonging a debate.—Look here! If you old duffers don't shut up,
why, I'm blessed if I won't take the whole lot of you with my left
hand There! Oh!
Passing reference to Lord Ripon.—He's a blooming Viceroy,
he is I
But examples need not be continued. It must be obvious, from
the above specimens, what a homely turn may be given to the debates
of the future if new Members will only take a leaf out of the Member
for Woodstock's latest Parliamentary Play-ground Note-Book.
Question fob this Wins'sdat. — Was Mr. Winn oanonised
when he was raised to the Upper House, and oalled " St. Oswald"?
When is a Bird from the Moors at this season of the year not so
dear as Grouse f When it's a little Cheeper.

"Warning? What wealthy citizen should

The Censor's cry, not stiffly scorn to heed it.
How long must Bumble-palsied London

The crass caprice of callous opulence P
Esthetic argument, of course, falls blunted
On our true Babylonian Pachyderm.
True, Little Pedlington might be affronted.
And Hole-oum-Corner Philistines might
squirm,
At being thought oblivious of the duty
Of paying civic reverence to Beauty.
But your true Cockney Croesus smiles supe-
rior
Upon the sentimental olaims of Taste;
What matters it if London's grey exterior
Be one huge sacrifice to greed—and paste,
So gold in swollen coffers is piled quicker,
Thanks to the Stucco-fiend and the Bill-
Sticker?
No, no, our " Citizen of no mean City"
Shares not the pride of Athens or old
Rome;
He does not care (Shame murmurs, "More's
the pity!")
To have a grand or decorative home.
What interest has he in dome or tower—
Unless as conduit for a Danae shower?
Pass thatl Our London Millionnaires care
little,
Finding their City brick, to leave it stone.
Who of them e'en contributes jot or tittle
To make the huge Metropolis stand alone
In splendour, as in spread of mile on mile?
Great Midas, no! That's not at all their style.
But cleanliness, and safety? There you'd
think
Their stodgy slow Batavian souls might
lighten:
To have it made a midden or a sink
You 'd hope might sicken them, or, if not,
frighten.
Bah I Would you know how greed can blind
and harden,
Good Stranger, go and look at Covent Garden!
Take oivet with you, take carbolic aoid,
And then—nose-pinching—gaze upon the

In London—brings a sense of obligation!

He will not shrink, or spare, or huckster

What make you, Muckrake, with your

Vain pleadings, Muckrake; they will come

Fast or Breakfast?
Do the various complainants against the
despotism of the "Autoorat of the Scotch
Breakfast-Table" really mean to say that
the extensive Licensed Victualler, so called,
will allow them no breakfast except at table
d'hote times, and refuses to allow them to be
served with a mess of porridge, or a roll and
an egg, or a slice of ham and a cup of tea or
coffee, at their own hours? Can the tourist
in the Land, of Cakes obtain no cake except
just when that imperious and bloated Bung
pleases? If so, any traveller contemplating
a tour in Scotland had better be provided
with a portable spirit-stove and supply of
provisions, so as to constitute himself his own
f' Cook's Tourist."
Questionable Comparative.—The present
Primieb has credit for getting on better
than the former did with Foreign Powers.
Why? Is Lord Salisbury a greater person
than the Grand Old One? Yes, they say he
is a persona grata.

BRER WOLFF TACKLES OLD MAN TURKEY-BUZZARD.
"The Porte is likely to proceed with excessive caution in the negotia-
tions with Sir H. D. Wolff."—Standard.
"Uncle Remus," said the little boy, "how did Brer "Wolff get
on with Brer Alligator, after all?"
"Who? Brer Wolff?" queried the old nigger vaguely, as though
not quite seeing the bearings of the question.
"Well, Uncle Remus, you know you said that Brer Bison and
Brer Fox and old Brer Hare and Brer Coon agreed to send Brer Wolff
to take the measure of Brer Alligator's back and mouth, and"
"Co'se I did, honey, co'se I did," interrupted the old man. "But
bress grashus, honey, gig atter gate don't allers mean stattin' fo'
home."
"Didn't Brer Wolff go, after all, then?" asked the little boy.
"Did'n' say dat nudder, honey," responded Uncle Remus. "But
dat sheep-skin wut 1 tell yer Brer Wolff wrop his self up in sorter
did'n' quite cover him, en de udder beasteses dey look at him mighty
suspeotious like, dey did, en Brer Wolff he upn sez ter Brer Fox,
sezee, 'Seems ter me dey sorter spishun sump'n,' sezee. En dis
kinder tarrify Brer Wolff, en he skasely knew w'at he gwinter do."
"And was Brer Fox terrified, also?" asked the little boy.
"Bress grashus, honey, dat he was'n. Who? Him? You dunno
nuthin' 'tail 'bout Brer Fox ef dat's de way you puttin' him down.
Seem like nuthin wouldn' tarrify Brer Fox, he wuz jes' as peart ez
a circus pony all de time, he wuz. But Brer Bison, en Old Brer
Hare, en Brer Coon, dey palaver longer wunner nudder like dey
ain't quite see der way thro' der goober patch; en Miss Meadows,
she look on, en Gran' Ole Man Rabbit, he lay low en watch. Gran'
Ole Man Rabbit he ain't say enny thing skazely, kase he sorter nussin
up his voice, ez wuz monstus weak longer much palaversomeness.
But his eyes mighty sharp still, en dey ain't miss mos' nuffin'.
"'Bout dis yer time Brer Pig he out up didos like he useter, en
mos' people 'spect ez Brer Bison, en Ole Man Hare, en Brer Fox, en
Brer Coon ud des come down on Brer Pig kerblam, en make him feel
sorter splimmy-splammy, like dey allers say dey'd do if dey ony
had der own way wid Brer Pig.
"And did they?" asked the little boy.
"Not dey, honey," returned the old man, with scornful emphasis.
"Soon's dey get do power dertelves dey cool off like po'in spring
water on one er des yer biggity fires. Brer Fox he done get mighty
familious like wid Brer Pig, en fus things you know dey wuz nail-
fellers, kaze Brer Pig he say Brer Fox ain't bin bodderin him like

Sally, ez useter back up Brer Fox, she let out like she 'd knock de

"But about Brer Wolff and Brer Alligator, Uncle Remus ?" asked
the little boy, with youthful persistency.
"Dat's des w'at I wur gwineter tell yer 'bout I " said the old man,
calmly. "All dis yer scumfishing wid wunner nudder tuk time, en
Brer Wolff he tuk time, en sorter primped hisself up, 'fore he sot out

"Brer Turkey-Buzzard?" queried the little boy, in surprise.
"Co'se honey," replied Uncle Remus, "Brer Turkey-Buzzard he
mighty artful, en he had a sorter hitch onter Brer Alligator's tail.
Gran' Ole Man Rabbit he ain't bin sorter nabersome wid Brer Turkey-
Buzzard nohow, but Brer Wolff ez wanted to bridle Brer Alligator

"En now you'd better lay low too, honey, en you '11 see sumpfin

From the Saucy "Sunbeam."
Com ins on board, the Axe-Minister warmly hugged the owner of
the Sunbeam, exclaiming, "Em-Brassey moi!" Merry Andrew
Clark said he'd heard this before. Mr. Gladstone is gradually
recovering tone, but the partial loss of voice, if it continues, would
at Election time still render him hoarse de combat. He is now on
the Sunbeam, cruising. Mr. Gladstone going about—(he often has
to "go about")—on a Sunbeam, sounds like the Yankee who went
round the world on a flash of greased lightning. When he gets well,
he will once again have a voice in the affairs of the nation. His
umbrella will be re-covered about the same time as his voice. Merry
Andrew Clark is one of the lifes and souls of the party.

MAJESTY AND MAGIC.
Sous interest, in the face of the present aspeot of affairs in Eastern Europe, has
naturally enough attached itself to what, under usual circumstances, would have
been a very commonplace event. It appears that " by special decree of the Sul-
tan," a French oharlatan who had appealed, through his Embassy, against the
prohibition of his publio performances by the Constantinople Police Authorities,
was the other day appointed "Court CoDjuror in Ordinary to His Majesty,"
with a salary, official dress, several orders in paste, and other perquisites, as
befitting his important position.
The report states that the Sultan, having expressed a wish to see the prettidi-
gitateuria question, and witness a specimen of his leger-de-main off-hand, the latter,
happening to commence his entertainment by the familiar appeal to his audience
"to lend him half-a-crown," His Majesty was not only so keenly touched with
sympathy at this immediate effort to borrow, but was, moreover, put into such
exoellent good-humour when it was discovered that not a notable in the apart-
ment had a single halfpenny in his pocket, that he ordered the Minister of the
Household to draw up the necessary form of investiture on the spot, and dis-
patched the Financial Adviser to the Imperial Treasury forthwith with a polite
autograph-letter to the British Ambassador, asking for the loan of the required
sum on the usual terms."
After a slight delay, which, involving some awkward pauses, at one time
threatened to cause a little uneasiness in the distinguished circle, the money,
arrived with the kindly meant, but significant, message " that it must really
be the last," and the familiar experiment was proceeded with. The trick is too
well known to need any description, suffice it to say the accustomed feats of
wrapping np the half-crown in a handkerchief, firing it from a gun, and
eventually cutting it ont of a prepared orange, were dexterously performed., and
gave infinite delight to the attentive and highly cultivated audience.
The only bitch ooourred when the Minister of Finance, who, thinking he was
holding up the half-crown in a box whiob really contained two guinea-pigs, a
canary, a oup of hot coffee, and the nine of spades, by some mishap let the well
loaded casket slip down his sleeve, and, evidently not noticing what he had done.
excused himself for leaving the room suddenly on the plea
that " he had just seen a friend waiting for him on the
other side of the way," through the palace window. At
the conclusion, however, mnch to the surprise of everybody
who had noted,this little incident, the money was found
safe enough inside the fruit, from which it was cut by the
Sultan himself, who instantly put it into his own pocket,
at the same time graciously observing he should keep it
as a special memento of the great pleasure the whole
performance had afforded him.
The making of a plum-pudding in an Imperial hatt next
followed, and before he left, the versatile entertainer pro-
mised, at the special request of His Majesty, on a subse-
quent occasion, to make the Russian Minister, Haltm
Pasha, and several other objectionable Court functionaries,
disappear permanently under a canvas extinguisher.
The Sultan seemed highly gratified by this announce-
ment, and after conversing cheerfully for some time with
those about him as to the possibility of introducing leger-
de-main into the Naval and Military accounts, ana of
"improving" the Budget on the same mysterious lines,
took his departure, privately, and unattended, for the
Ra-hat-la-khoum quarter.

THE TWELFTH OF AUGUST.
The mist is on the distant
hills,
The presage of the noon-
day heat,
The murmur of the moun-
tain rills
On all the air is silver
sweet.
The yellow gorse-bnsh is
ablaze.
Brae-mar The heather rolls a purple
sea;
The glory of the August days
Is with us upon moor and lea.
The grouse are calling in the ling,
Where yonder tufts of heather rise,
Or, whirling on impulsive wing,
Look black against the clear blue
A shot I The old cock topples down,
The first to rise and first to fall:
Or.haply blazing at " the brown,"
The eager sportsman misses all.
No matter. Breast the coming hill,
Next time take steady aim and true,
And well we know the bag shall fill,
Or ere there falls the evening dew.
Far better this than Rotten Row,
Or all the wrangles of the House,
To walk where Norland breezes blow
In August, and to slay the grouse.
There's new life in the moorland air,
Far dearer this than foreign lands,
And wot we Cleveland hills
are fair,
Where Guisbrough's an-
cient abbey stands.
No sight more beautiful
we orave,
Than this our eager eyes
descry;
For lo I on yonder watohet
wave,
The white sails flash
'twixt sea and sky. For-lar.

IZAAK WALTON'S COMPLETE(LY) DONE ANGLER.
Ghost of Piscatob. Ghost of Viatob.
Viator. Whither away, Master P A good morning to you! I have
stretched my legs to catch the train to Tottenham, and here I find
yon with rod and basket, as of old.
Piscator. Faith, Scholar, I have even been too long an angler with
Nkbo, in the lake of darkness, and would fain take a chub, Totten-
ham way, and see mine old haunts.
Viator. Then have with you, Master; and I do mind me of pretty
Maudlin that hereabouts would sing us, " Come, Shepherds, deck
your heads!"
Piscator. Ay, Scholar, methinks Maudlin was the Siren that led
thee to the River Lea more than all my wisdom. But here we are
got to Tottenham, and to the waterside.
Viator. Oh, oh, Master, what place is this, and what smell oometh
to my nostrils? See, see, Master, here be no chub, bnt two dead dogs
and one departed oat 1
"Piscator._ In sooth. Scholar, the country seemeth strange, and no
man may live, nor nsh neither, hard by such an open sewer. Can
this be the Lea! Nay, Scholars, this is no place for honest anglers
more. Bnt hither walks Corydon. Let us ask him what makes
this blackness in the water, and the smell that abides here, as they
say frankincense and myrrh do cling, more sweetly, to the shores of
the blessed Arabia. What ho, Corydon, what cheer P
Corydon.* Sir, the condition of the River Lea is something really
fearful. From Tottenham downwards the water is a mere open sewer,
emitting the most noxious exhalations. Boating and bathing have
ceased, and the River is now only a danger to the neighbourhood.
Piscator. Say you so P And what maketh that it should be so?
Corydon. Ah, Master, the drainage of Tottenham is turned bodily
into the stream, and, in spite of Local Boards, the nuisance continues
unaltered.
Piscator. And why right they not this wrong; for, marry, the poor
folk here will die, and a pestilence be bred, if ye live not more
cleanly.
Corydon. Sir, no man knows this better than the Tottenham
Authorities themselves, who cause a horrible, disgusting nuisance to
the dwellers on the Lea. They simply sow disease broadcast among
thousands of helpless people, to save the expenditure of a certain
sum of money.
Piscator. Fenny wise, and pound foolish—penny wise, and pound
foolish I Soon shall we have the Great Plague here again, and none
to blame but the chuckle-headed " Authorities," my Masters I Come
away, Scholars, come away. The silver Lea is bedraggled. 'lis no
place for peaceful ghosts, that would be quiet, and go a-fishing.
[They vanish.

PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
MY LONG PROFESSIONAL SERVICES RECEIVE RECOGNITION.
4v ft aviso given the
J ] IL amount of work
X^Iy that pours into
^if > my chambers
"very careful con-
sideration, 1 re-
cently came to
the conclusion,
that in spite of
its satisfactory
vastness, I yet
had some little
leisure to devote
to an appoint-
ment of a quasi-
judioial charac-
ter. Looking
about me, the
first eligible post
that attracted my attention was a Deputy Coronership, whioh
was offered to me on the top of a drag at Epsom during the last
raoe but one on the Derby Day. I had accompanied the

of which the .Coroner was one, to the meeting in question in
hope of settling tfep matter off-hand. As a rule I am decidedly
averse to the race-cVirse, but consented to appear on this occa-
sion for the purpose I have already avowed. The Coroner, who
had been a little reserved during the earlier part of the day, became
most friendly after luncheon, and pressed me, with tears in his eyes,
to accept the appointment. Seeing that he was suffering under some
excitement (he was wearing a false nose and had decorated his hat
with small Dutch dolls), I thought it better to say I would send my
reply on the following morning, by post, so that he might have a
written record of my approval. This seemed to please him deeply.
Indeed, he wept like a child for five minutes, and then succumbed
to a heavy slumber. However, the matter came to nought, as my
emotional friend qualified shortly afterwards for Han well.
Bather out of spirits at my failure re the Deputy Coronership, I
entered one morning, just before the Long, the Court presided over
by Mr. Justioe Dendleeins, and to my surprise, found my friend
and quondam school-fellow, Hartm an, seated on the Bench beside
his Lordship. "Conkey," (so we used to call Hartm an at Win-
minster) seemed as astonished to see me as I was to recognise him.
He hurriedly joined me in the corridor. "Hullo," he cried, shak-
ing me violently by the hand, "what brings you here P"
I was pleased at his recognition, as some of the juniors who had
been doing nothing particular all the morning in the Court, had fol-
lowed me out, and having seen Haktman on the Bench were much
impressed that I should be on familiar terms with a person of such
evident distinction. So I explained that I had come over from
another court, having a few minutes of leisure. I trusted that my
friend would be taken for some great lawyer conversant with my
marked forensio ability—say for, instance, the Lord Chief Justice of
the United States.
"Indeed! " said Conkey. "But what made you put on a wig
and gown? Are you a Barrister?"
This question showed such lamentable ignorance on Haktman's
Sart that I thought it well to hurry him away. I was not sorry,
eing en garqon (my wife and children were enjoying a few weeks
of ozone at Heme Bay) when he subsequently asked me to dine with
him at his Club. During dinner I explained my position, and told
him my hopes and fears about obtaining an appointment.
"I sav," he exolaimed suddenly, "couldn't old Dendleeins help
you? He's not half a bad chap.
I replied that I had already made an application, with accompany-
ing testimonials, to his Lordship, and had been answered with a ourt
acknowledgment of receipt Judging by reference to tradition I did
not expeot much, consequently, from Mr. Justice Dendleeins.
"Look here; you come down to my box on the 12 th, and I will see
what I can do for you," impulsively cried my friend, and although 1
argued that I was an indifferent sportsman, he would take no refusal,
Somewhat to my trepidation the first person that I met at the
hospitable board at High moor was Mr. Justice Dendleeins, who had
managed to devote a portion of his vaoation to the ohase of the wily
C>use. Thanks to Haktman's kindness I was seated next his
rdship, who was most gracious, telling me several mirth-provoking
stories, until, by one of my remarks showing a deep knowledge of the
intricacies of scientific law (it was a definition of a contingent
remainder), it suddenly occurred to him that I must be a member of
the Profession to which he himself belonged. _ I admitted the impeach-
ment, when Mr. Justioe Dendleeins immediately assumed a haughty
demeanour and answered all my further questions in monosyllables.
When we had got to the ooff ee-and-cigars stage of our dinner, Hakt-
man, seeing that the relations between his Lordship and myself were
strained, called upon me to show how I could balance a cork on a wine-
glass, with the assistance of two pendent fruit-forks. This I declined
to do, thinking that it was rather beneath my dignity, until urged
by Mr. Justice Dendleeins, who, it appeared, although extremely
fond of sleight-of-hand tricks, was but an indifferent amateur con-
juror. My feat was loudly applauded, especially by his Lordship,
who practised it under my direction for some time, wishing, as he
said, to become proficient in the art himself.
"Oh, Judge," cried Haetman, " Snoot (that's what we used to
call BBIEELES8 at Winminster) knows lots of games like that. Draw
him out, and make him show you the whole bag o' tricks."
After this his Lordship was more cordial, and before retiring to
rest condescended to say that "he was pleased to have met me, the
more especially as the imitation tallow-dip converted out of a section
of an apple and a split almond was new to him and very ingenious."
I got up early, very early, the next morning, as I wished (being,
as I have already said, an indifferent sportsman) to have a little
private practice with my gun before I joined the more experienced
votaries of Diana. As I walked along I noticed that another member
of the house-party seemed to have the same purpose. He was appa-
rently undersized and fat, but as his back was turned towards me,
and I am rather short-sighted, I failed to recognise him. Suddenly
he came to a wood, raised his gun, and fired. Then he hurried up to
the spot where his quarry had fallen, and peered into the bushes.
Seemingly much moved by the sight that met his view, without
touching the victim of bis skill, he quickly retraced his steps, and
seated himself under a tree, evidently suffering from extreme agita-
tion. Curious to learn what had so moved him, I approached the
bushes. Horrified too at the sight, I gently raised the slaughtered
creature in my arms, and approached the guilty one. We recognised
one another, and he turned pale. I was profoundly shocked.
"Mr. Justice Dendleeins," I said at last, solemnly, "it~is~my
painful duty to denounce you as a vulpicide!"
"My dear Mr. Briefless, it was purely accidental, I can assure
you," explained the Judge, in a voice broken with emotion.
"I do not require your assurance, my Lord," I returned, more in
sorrow than in anger, and taking a sort of painful pleasure in sum-
ming up, as it were, against his Lordship, continued gravely: "bat
both you and I know that by the unwritten but traditional common
law of this realm of England, one who shoots a fox is considered more
guilty, more to be shunned and hated, than he who shoots a man."
"True, very true," admitted his Lordship, with a shudder.
"Mr. Briefless, this is a case both you and I, as members of a
noble profession, must hush up. The Bench and the Bar have, from
time immemorial, been on terms of the utmost cordiality, and you
and I must keep up the tradition."
I was silent and unmoved. I looked out into the distance sternly.
"Mr. Briefless," continued his Lordship, after a painful pause,
"I have been reading the testimonials you were good enough to
forward to me, and '*
"My Lord," I interrupted, "no appeal from the Benoh to the Bar
has ever failed to meet with a response. For the honour of the
profession this tragedy must be a secret between us."
I have nothing more to say, save that owing to the arduous pro-
fessional duties additionally imposed upon me by my recent
appointment by Mr. Justioe Dendleeins to a Deputy-Assistant-
Revising-Barristership, I may be unable, for a very considerable
time to come (a period that will undoubtedly include the whole of
the Long Vaoation), to give any attention to literary composition.
A. Briefless, Junior.
A Little Change Wanted.
Some Somebodies (no matter who, we read it in the Daily Tele-
graph's fashionable news) have left Town for Cadlands, on a visit to
Lady Somebody Else. "Cadlands!" what a name 1 Cockneydom is
nothing in comparison with it. Is the shubbery at Cadlands called
"The Snobbery"? Why not change it at once, and, in order to
break it gently, previous to
altering it entirely, call it
THE EGYPTIAN LOAN.

The Joint Guarantee—by the Powers!
'Arry-on-the-r,IlT!'P But
"Cadlands"! Lands of Cads!
No, no; reform it altogether!
Celibacy of the Ermine.—
It appears that great difficulty
is experienced on Circuit by
the Sages of the Law in work-
ing the new system of " single
Judges." Materfamiliaa is
naturally rejoioed to hear that

able as that of the single Judges
system doesn't answer.

So, to proceed! To tax the people's Malt
Has always struck me as extremely curious.
The Had mind has a vile and vital fault,
It's passion for the people is but spurious.
Love you, yet tax your liquor! An assault
Upon your pleasures that must make you furious!
Inorease the price of Beer P The mere suggestion
Brings British Liberty at onoe in question.
Believe me, they are scoundrels in a body,
Who'd lay so vile an impost your poor backs on;
They do not touoh the wine of Lord Tom Noddy,
But your " Four-half" would lay a heavy tax on.
Not Claret, or Champagne, or Whisky-toddy,
No, but the favourite swizzle of the Saxon,
That blessed boon that all your woes can scatter,
And make you happier, wiser, stronger, fatter!

These was a little Earl, and he had a little gun.
And some paper bullets looking much like lead—lead—lead,
And he said, " I know a rig that shall dish each little Whig,
And strike each noisy Bad upon the head—head—head."
And this funny little Earl had a funny little bag,
Which he labelled " Commission upon Trade—Trade—Trade;"
And he said, "I '11 pop away, and the people all will Bay,
Why what a wond'rous Bag he has made—made—made!"
And he popped and popped and popped; but the birds in cover
stopped,
That is, except the voung ones, who went cheep—cheep—cheep!
But the old ones—which seemed strange—kept most slily out of
range,
And at the puzzled sportsman took a peep—peep—peep!
Then that funny little Earl, he tried every little dodge,
He sprinkled chaff, he took a pinch of salt—salt—Ealt,
Yet the sly old birds—how queer!—were not tempted to come near,
But at respeotf ul distance made a halt—halt—halt.
Then that funny little Earl was exceedingly depressed;
But they who saw the spectaole did laugh—laugh—laugh;
For the little Earl forgot paper pellets are not shot,
And old birds cannot be caught with salt or chaff—chaff—chaff.
NUGEE AND OLD nOBHY.
Last Saturday the^Rev. Mr. Nugee crowned a Rotiire at Walworth.
'Arry heard of it, and was disgusted. "What's rosey 'airP" he
id. "Why not call her 'carrots' at once P" By the way, has
Nugee ever been interviewed P If anyone ought to be trotted
it is a New Gee.
"AND IS OLD DOUBLE DEAD?"
Certainly, as any door-nail. Mr. Joseph Hatton has killed him
in John Needham't Double, which we highly recommend. The
"Shilling Dreadful" has beaten the old-fashioned three-volume
novel out of the field of sensational literature. There is no room for
tall writing, or mere padding, when a real good story has to be told
in two hundred small pages of print large enough to defy twilight
and railway-carriage lamps. This, to a traveller who can read in
a train is a very great thing, specially if the novel itself is one
calculated to keep him awake for a couple of hours on the stretoh.
John Needham't Double achieves the feat. It begins with a
slow movement, gradually it increases in intensity and the reader
cannot turn over the pages quick enough to satisfy his curiosity.
Whether there was any necessity for the author to bring in John
Sadleth's story, and to found his novel upon it, is what we are un-
able to decide, though the plan certainly gives such an air of reality
to the romance, that yon feel you are reading the true solution of
the mystery of John Sadleib's supposed suicide told under fictitious
names. The title, John Needham't Double, does not sound sensa-
tional, being suggestive of a story about Whist, with which, how-
ever, it has nothing on earth to do. The climax, given with true
dramatio energy, brings down the curtain on a very strong situation.
With a very little working up, for there is a " love interest" ready
to hand, it onght to be turned into a strong sensation drama, which,
should the acting and dialogue be equal to the construction, might
keep a theatre going for a year. We compliment Mr. Josephub Junior
on the Double, hope he '11 make it a treble and the rub, and so we
take our hat off to Mr. Hatton.

KOBERT ON THE RIVER.
Haviso found dear old Streetley such a
reglar pairodice of a place last year, I
natrally sort its cool seekweatwed stream
for annother weak's rapshur this here year.
Not as I ackshally went down there on
speck. Noing how full it gine rally is, I
rites down to a old trend of mine at the
"Bull," to no if there was room for us, and
his anser was, "No, Robebt, not for no-
hoddy, for wen a littel Baby was born last
week, Docter said as he didn't no where
they coud put it, the place was so full, and
as bad luck wood have it, it was Twins!"
Howsumever, I mussent complain, for,
as Bbown trewly says, a man ahood see as

Waiter as ain't pleased with Marlow must

is as gets a grand dinner without paying

Marlow seems to have got everythink as
any reesonabel olliday maker can want to
make him appy. It's got a Bridge, and a
Church, and a Tea gardens, and a Abby,
and a Shop where you can buy a Bottel of
Wine for 1». 3d.—witch altho it doesn't suit
me may posserbly suit others, there's no
telling wot sum peeple won't drink if you
give it a forren name and say as the Queen
often haves it—and a Lock, where the Terns
Conservatifs only charges you 3d. for a

and a Wear, that ain't of much use now,
coz it's Dangerous, but I dessay it was
wunce—and ewen wears must wear out sum
day or they woodn't be called such names—
and glorious Woods right up to the werry
tops of the mountanes, where, one of the
jolly yung watermen told me, as they grows
most of the timber for the British Navey,
witch I can esily beleeve as I seed many
trees amost as big round as I ham. He says
it's coz they grows so preshus slow as makes
the Second Lord of the Hadmiralty so long
a bilding the Ion Clads, and the reason why
they don't grow quicker is coz the soil is
all Marl oh! but I don't somhow phansy
as my young frend is strickly trewthful.
Boatmen is like Marines, they is muoh more
partiokler in wot's told to them than in
wot they tells 'to hothers. Then we has
lots of lovely Swons, as graeefull as dubble
skull yung ladys, but I ain't yet seen none
of them with 2 necks, so praps they all
keeps lower down at Bolter's Lock, witch
wood seem to be the nat'ral place for 'em.
My yung frend told me as there is a mith,
I think he called it, tho' I think I shood
call it even a shorter name, that formerly,
wen the monks at Bisham, close by, killed
some swans, they sent a cupple of em to a
Lord of the Manner about 4 miles off, to
Cook'em 1 but of coarse he didn't know as
he was a forking to a Hed Waiter; much

SAFETY ON THE SEA-SHORE.
Yolttntkzr Coast Defence Association! Capital idea 1
"Britannia needs no bulwarks,
No towers along the steep,"
sang the patriot Poet. But times have altered, and local camps of
Naval Artillery at the important points along our sea-coast, where
Volunteers are instructed in submarine mining and torpedo practice,
as well as drill, gunnery, and rifle exercise, will be "bulwarks'
that may come in handy one of these days. There has been talk of
the enemy, in time of war, shelling our sea-ports and watering-
places. It is not this particular sort of "shells " that the myriad
migrants to the sea-side at this season desire to " gather from day to
day." Let these myriads only think how unpleasant it would be to
have an enemy in the offing, with the exact range of the esplanade
and the bathing-machines, and nobody near to divert their attention
with a few tentative torpedoes, and Mr. Punch is confident they will
be ready with their sympathy, and, if need be, something more sub-
stantial, for the Volunteer Coast Defence Association.
New Fobm of Advertisement.—Visitors to the Inventories are
now tattoo'd every evening till further notice. At an early hour the
tattoo is only on one spot, but, before half-past ten, the order of the
night is, "Tattoo all over!" This latest addition to the Inventions
is entirely due to the fertile brain of Mr. Somers Vine, in whose
honour the grateful Directors are thinking of re-naming this part of
Kensington "Somers' Town." If the fact of your having been to
the Inventories is doubted, you have now only to bare your left arm
—where the traditional strawberry mark is preserved—and exhibit
the tattoo of the Inventories. The gates will be thrown open, " Pass
Tattoo and all's well," and you oan enjoy yourself till, instead of
tattoo, you say " Ta-ta!" ana go home.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDOI
BRADSHAW'S FUN.

'Tis many years since, in the Handy-volume Series, was published
after its appearance in M. Punch's collection, The Guide to Brad-
thaw with its specimen pages. Bradshaw's Guide has grown stouter
and of course older, but otherwise he is unchanged, and for real
wit, humour, and genuine practical joking, it still remains without,
as far as we can ascertain, a rival worthy of consideration. Un-
changed, yes, in character, but there is in the Time-tables such a
development of racy fun, that shows how our Guidet Philosopher,
and Friend takes lite, how he enjoys it, and how anxious he is that
others should enjoy it too. All that was true when our Guide to
Bradshaw first appeared is equally true now, only, perhaps, that in
some instances the humour is less subtle, and its effect more imme
diately apparent.
The notion of Bradshaw's Guide advertising himself on his own
cover as "Officially every month," and announcing that his
Time-tables are from the official Time-tables of all the Railways
throughout the length and breadth of Great Britain, is specially
humorous when taken in conjunction with the fact that all the
Railways in Great Britain do not acknowledge Bradshaw's Guide
as in any way their Official Representative. The Directors,
may, if they bke, bind Bradshaw's Guide and keep the volumes
on their shelves, but they themselves refuse to be bound by
Bradshaw.
Bradshaw,—no matter who the proprietors may be,—there must
always be an ideal Bradshaw who is the moving spirit, the Puck, of
the whole affair,—Bradshaw, then, must have chuckled immensely
to himself when he announced on the outside of the Guide, in small
capitals, that these Official Tables were " specially arranged " for
himself and his readers.
"Specially arranged" trains they indeed are, if unofficial, and
unrecognised by Railway Authority in spite of what Bradshaw may
say. What is to prevent '.Bradshaw and his staff of Compilers—all
practical jokers, representing Joe Miller and his Men—from just
making any Time-tables they like, trusting to their imagination for
the facts P—and what is to Btop them from not only specially, but
fancifully arranging the trains on a Go-as-you-please sort of plan,
names of places, routes, and time being no object, tmt simply putting
them all together for the mere fun of the thing, and out of pure
"divilment, bedad !"?
Once more we give an ideal Joe Miller Bradshaw Time-Table,
which trains are specially arranged to run on the above-menti
lines, everything being speoially arranged, nothing guaranteed, and
pick and choose where you like:—

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[August 22, 1885.

Affable Stranger. "And arb you the ONLY One?"
ALTRUISM.
Small Boy. "Oa, mo! There 's Papa and Mamma, you know!"
WAITING A WAtL-CRY;
OE, WHAT WILL HE SAT NEXT?
What will he say P A wise old bird and wary,
With manifold mimetio power of throat,
The Gamecock's crow, the trill of the Canary,
The Eagle's war-shriek and the Cushat's note,
All come alike and easy to his throttle,
To whom the Mooking Bird and Whistling Crow
Are as an Oxford don to Aristotle.
What will he say? The bird-world waits to know.
All Nephelo-Coooygia's in a flurry,
There is a ceaseless whirr of worrying wings,
As when a grouse-brood, scuttling hurry-scurry,
Souds through the rustling heather, or upspnngs
The plumy pheasant 'midst the yellowing bracken,
Cackle ana clapperclaw go on all round.
Nor will beaks rest or aimless shindy slacken
Until the Bird-King's f ugle-flutings sound.
Epops is silent! Kites and Crows are scuffling,
The Jackdaw chatters, and the Raven croaks;
Pigeons and Doves their blameless plumes are ruffling,
And interchanging ineffective strokes.
The Wanton Woodcock and the Daring Duckling
Wage noisy war. But Epops silent sits.
What is he doing? O'er the conflict chuckling,
Or, like the Laureate's owl, "wanning his wits?"
Of what, they wonder, is the Old Bird thinking,
Sitting in solemn silence on his perch.
Means he to lead them on and fight " like winking,"
Or cut the fray and leave them in the lurch?
They want a Cry! He who has raised so many,
Will he shout forth one more, with victory fraught '<
They'd give muoh more than the proverbial penny,
That plumed host, to read the Old Bird's thought.
The Jackdaw prates. Who cares for Tharrelides?
The Haven croaks—unto the Timet—who notes?
The quid nunc Magpies soandalise—quid ridet t
Mother Gamp's goose-flook strain their outstretched throats
In ominous ana awe-awaking hissing;
All Cuckoo-Cloudland is astir with fuss;
But from the chorus one clear note is missing.
Why sits the Oracle in silence thus?
Is he excogitating something novel?
A war-cry that shall rally, rouse, affright,
At which the opposing hosts shall pale and grovel,
When Cuckoo-Land goes rushing to the fight?
Whilst he is dumb the world of beaks and feathers
With veering winds and voices vain is vext:
His Cry has lea it in all ways and weathers.
Now they need rallying. What will he say next?
Raisinable Warning.
"An Old Fruit-Importer" writes to the Timet with respect to
Valencia Raisins. He says:—" I know of nothing more likely than
sun-dried raisins to have the microbes of cholera superinduced upon
them, and thus import this dire disease." The fruit of Valenoia will
probably, after this revelation, have no raisin d'etre at the British
Grocer's. But how about the Spanish Onion P How about Spanish
Liquorice P It would be satisfactory to know what is and what is
not miorobaoeous.
A Crying Shame.—The Manchester City Council have decided
that newspapers shall not be hawked about by shouting'vendors in
the pleasant place in which they reside on Sunday. So for the future
the Sabbath in those parts will be " Sootcher" than ever. Travellers
are warned, therefore, that if they expect to post themselves up in
the daily news in Manchester between Saturday and Monday, they
will be trusting to a broken read.
Cesar and Commerce.—Why do Free-Traders refuse to join the
Trade Commission P Free Trade, like Cesar's wife, most not even
be suspected.

SEA-SIDE STUDIES.
By Dumb-Crambo Junior.

securing a lively-hood.

A Sail over the Bay.
A MANIFEST CORRECTION.
Sib,—In last week's Number I saw your clever Artist's
satirical, political, adaptation of Mr. Harding Cox's well
known piotnre, The Tug of War, and it struck me, as it
must have struck you, as an old Oppidan, that just now
the true reading, from an Etonian point of view, would be

"The 'Tug' of Warre,"
which will be intelligible to everyone who has been
brought up in the cool cloisters of " Henry's holy Bhade."
Yours, with my classic motto,
Dum Crambo Crambo!
ESSENCE OP PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY M.P.
House of Lords, Monday Night, August 10th.—Mill-
town coming rapidly to the front. Denman growing
jealous; threatens to be urged on to fresh endeavours to
keep himself in view. Haven't forgotten how the other
day Mllltown drove Granville nearly mad by assuming
charge of Medical Relief Bill. Now discovers fresh Irish
grievance. In State papers it appears this realm is
alluded to as Great Britain. Should be "United King-
dom of Great Britain and Ireland." This, it seems, is the
secret sorrow that [consumes Ireland and keeps it in con-
stant revolt. Bad harvests a mere trifle; coercion a flea-
bite; grand jury laws a joy; and the day's absence from
duty without leave of a rural postman, to which Joseph
Glllis called attention the other day, is not worth men-
tioning. The root of Ireland's grief is this.ignoring of
her name in State papers.
Markiss muoh moved at the discovery. Glad to do anything to meet the case.
Would the Eduoation Department supply him with substantives and adjectives
suitable for the expression of his noble friend's ideas? Or would his noble
friend aid the Government in this great enterprise by his linguistic and gram-
matical acquirements? Mili.towx, much pleased at this frank reception of his
ideas, said he would think it over.
After this seems waste of time for Commons to go on with Land Purchase
Bill, originally designed for amelioration of condition of Ireland. If Mill-
town's suggestion be carried out, this and much else superfluous. Nevertheless
Irish Land Purchase BiU prooeeded with—in truth sat up all night with. Tim
Healt back after too lon$ absence. Quite a changed man. Really affeoting in
his deferenoe to Beach, his patronage of Hart-Dyke, and his politeness towards
his " Hon. and learned friend " the Attorney-General for Ireland. Late Attorney-
General for, Ireland hearing Tim's honeyed phrases addressed to Hart-Dyke
lays bis forefinger on Bide of his nose and ejaculates " Walker!" Trevelyan
looks on grimly, and Campbell-Bannerman prophesies that the truce won't last
into next Session. In the meantime it's very pleasant by comparison with what
used to be. Business done.—Housing of Working Classes Bill read Second
Time. Irish Land Purchase Bill in Committee.
Tuesday.—House gradually reaching Btage at which final disappearance
imminent. Not enough Members to form quorum when Speaker arrived to
take Chair. Must be forty Members present, or British Constitution go to the
dogs. Speaker cast eagle eye around empty benches. "One—two—three"
he began to count, and got on admirably up to sixteen. Then, with a sweep of
his cocked-hat in the direction of Strangers' Gallery, beginning to fill, he
touched himself on the breast, and, in a voice that defied contradiotion, said,
"Forty!"
Warton jumped up, but remembering who was responsible for conduct of
business, sharply sat down again, took a pinch of snuff, and occupied himself with
the Orders. Tim Healy took short measures with Joseph Glllis. Before my
friend could quite grasp the situation, Tim had him by the elbow, and led him
forth.
"But—but—" Joey B. stuttered, "there ain't forty there 1"
"No," said Tim, severely. "But there soon wiU be."
"That's all very well," said Joseph, whose keen mental eye had pierced the
soleoism; "and so are your hobnobbings with Randolph, your meetings behind
the Chair, and your confabulations on the Terrace. But if it means that I am
to miss an opportunity of Counting Out the House at Four o'Clock, it won't do,
Tim Healy. Never had suoh a chance before; all these years I've waited for
it. Fanoy how riled the Government would be losing a day just now, upsetting
everybody's plans, and putting off Prorogation. Might be standing now in corner
of Palace Yard watching Members hurry down, and see their faces when they
find the House is up. Treaties and that sort of thing all very well; but I 'U
have my rights!"
Never saw Joey B. so angry. Business, once started, went on steadily
enough. A lot of Members who came down yesterday with speeches on Second
Reading of Housing of Working Classes Bill, and then bowled out, now produced
their manuscript, and had good time of it. Didn't much matter; nobody listened.
They might as well talk" on this subjeot as any other to fill up time. Once,
towards Eleven o'Clock, Bourke came in, stood for a moment at the Bar, looked
round, and quickly disappeared. Imposing spectacle whilst he remained, his
pocket-handkerchief hanging dangerously far out of bis breast-pocket, and bis
hair wonderfully and fearfully built up.
"Burke and Hare," Edward Clarke whispered to Charles Russell, his
professional mind running on criminal cases. Business done.—Nearly all.
Wednesday.—In both Houses Votes of Thanks moved to the Soldiers and
Sailors who fought in the Soudan. Attendance necessarily small; but proceed-
ings most hearty.
"The campaign," said Hartlngton, "has proved that the ancient courage of
our soldiers and sailors has in no degree deteriorated. It has proved that the in-
telligence, the resources, and the knowledge of their profession, alike of officers
and men, have considerably increased. It has proved, also, how wide and
varied are the military resources of the British Crown, and that for the purposes
of war, as weU as for the purposes of peace, the British Empire is not only a
name, but a reality."
So say all of us, with one cheer more, and a thought of proud regret for those
whose ears are btopped to praise or blame, and who lie, some in nameless graves,
in the wastes of the sad Soudan.
Never saw a man in suoh distress as Bryck. Found him in quiet corner
of library this afternoon, with eyes red, weeping and sobbing still.
"Come, come," I said. "Cheer up. Can't have you chortling in the library
of the House of Commons. If you want to weep, you must hire a room some-
where, paying rent in advance. Besides, what's the matter with you P You 're
not crying, I suppose, beoause this Parliament is coming to an end? What is it?"
"The Infant BiU," he sobbed.
"The Infant Bill? What's the matter with himf Is he dead? Has he
got the croup, or the chicken-pox'( Is he teething, measling, fevering, or
whooping-coughing F I sympathise with you as a young father. But really, you
know, you mustn't bring your private griefs here. Come into the House now, to
hear Sexton. This is his last chance, and he's making the most of it. Three
speeches already, and evidently good for another half dozen."
Turned out there was a mistake somewhere. The Infant Bill is not a young

Let it stop where it is. Have Black Rod in in a minute." Blaok Rod

a Bill, and bows to
the five cloaked
figures on the wool-
sack. 1). does the
same. C. calls out
name of Bill, and bows again. D. bows, and then, half turning
his head towards the canaille at the Bar, literally chucks at
them the words, "La reyne le veult." Very shocking thing for
gentlemen who daily breathe air of House of Lords to have to notice
Speaker and the Commons. But must be done, and 0. does it with
more eloquence than his brother ever showed. He begins in wearied,
vexed tone. As the list of Bills proceeds—and to everyone he must
needs chant " La reyne le veult"—his voice .deepens in melancholy,
and his manner in depression. He hardly turns his head at all at last,
and I believe if there'd been another Bill to-dav he would have died.
Members troop back to i, > i t S^->

out the Speech all had

Speaker, shake hands and
pass away, some of them
never to return.
"But you'll come back

pressing my paw. "Barks

Member, and is not inclined
to change. You'll find
Gladstone and me here,

he set out Norwayging, and
grasping my hand, said,
I don't say good bye, my
Lord, but au revoir."
Business done.—All.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LOG OF THE "SUNBEAM."
Hebe I am at Greenhithe. Feel like "hardy Norse-
man " whose " house of yore was on the foaming wave."
Andrew Clark says I am "an 'oarse man, without my
voice." He means it well, as a joke, I think. Small
orowd assembled to see me off. Humorous local Radical
wishes me "sure profit and quiok return" from voyage.
Want to make short speech—Andeew Clark (why is he
here ?) tells crowd that I 've "entirely lost the use of
my voice." Andrew takes me by arm, and hustles .me
into boat.
On " Sunbeam."—Nice, but small. "Wonder if I shall
feel more sea-sick than on Pembroke Cattle. Andrew
Clark says, "Very likely," and reminds me of what an
"excessively bad sailor" lam. Wish he wouldn't^say
so in presenoe of crew.
Mouth of Thames— Brasset says it's "blowing half
a gale outside." Then don't let's go outside. Brasset
says he won't. Anchors off Nore for night. If vessel
tosses like this when there's only half a gale and we 're in
Thames, sincerely hope I shall be preserved from a whole
gale in North Sea.
Cabin. — Luxuriously appointed Cabin. Thoughtful
of Lady Brasset to put handsomely bound copy of Voyage
of " Sunbeam" on my table. In glancing over it, see the
yacht has been to Honolulu. Why not go to Honolulu
now P And escape General Election!
Speak to Steersman about it. How the ship does roll!
Steersman never heard of Honolulu. Andrew Clark
says I mustn't speak to the man at the wheel, and takes
me away.
Andrew orders me below—says too much sea-air bad
for my voice. They've put him (why on earth did
Brasset invite him ?) in cabin next door to mine. Heard
me last night denouncing Salisbubt in my sleep, and
came in and woke me up, and told me I should " lose my
voice altogether if I went on in that way, and where
would Liberal Party be then?" Argument cogent, but
unpleasant.
In North Sea.—Wish I were on dry land. How it
does pitch I . Oh, for an hour of Downing Street now!
And to think of the " Stopgaps " enjoying themselves in
my vacant place!
Clark says "must not pursue these thoughts." Must
try and " forget politics." Well, then, why not go to
Honolulu P Brasset says " he doesn't mind." Andrew
very unpleasant—says "he's surprised at my indecision
and vacillation"—(remindsme of the Soudan debates) —
and " didn't I know when I started that we were bound
for coast of Norway?"
Try to soften Andrew. Take him aside, and ask
him, as a personal favour, when we get to Norway, to put
me ashore on banks of some desolate Fiord, where I can
wander away, and be never heard of more.
Andrew says I mustn't talk any more, even to him,
and shuts me up in my cabin. Hate being shut up by
anyone. Very seldom happens.
Second Day Out.—Wish Brasset wouldn't always be
trying to explain all about " that little slip of the half-
million," as he calls it. Tells me it was Nobthbrook's
fault, really, and " it shan't occur again." Says, almost
weeping, that he's bought a Colenso's Arithmetic, and
hopes to be able to add up Admiralty accounts quite nicely
by time our voyage ends.
Evening.—Regular hurricane. Wonder if Brasset
knows how to make a raft? Might do me good to go and
ask him. I will.
Find Brasset sitting on companion hatchway (not
quite sure of term, but sounds nautical), adding up some
figures on a slate. Says "he's been having a good cry."
Try to cheer him up by telling him a "good cry " is just
what is wanted for November Elections. Seems glad to
see me, and Bays " he doesn't think he has quite explained
the real way in which that little slip of the hali-million
happened." Retire hastily to cabin, and lock myself in.
In Port, Somewhere in Denmark.—Thank heaveD,
that's over! Denmark. Forgot to bring a Hamlet with
me. Hope I shall have a lot of hamlets with me when
I get back my voioe. Feel more comfortable. Perhaps
Brasset was right in inviting Andbew Clabk. Wouldn't
have done it myself. Proprose to Brasset to call on
King of Denmark, and coach him up on facts of
Penjdeh Arbitration business. Brasset suggests doing
it coming back. Says, as it's quite calm now, per-

A CANDID INQUIRER.
"I sat, John, is there antthino I haven't Tasted?"
"No, Sib, I think not—except Water!"
haps I would like to hear "exact state of the case about that little slip of
the half-million?"
Make polite excuse, and hurry off to Andrew. Propose to him that we
should pop up Baltio and meet Czar in Finland somewhere. Andrew very cold
about it. Says " Czab won't care two straws about seeing us as, we haven't got
Tenntson onboard," and gives me some new medicine to take. Nastitrthan
ever I Yes,—why on earth did Brasset ask Clark here?
Speak to Brasset privately. Ask him to put Andrew in irons for a short
time. Brasset doesn't like to. What's the good of being a Sea-Lord, if you 're
afraid of a Doctor? Andrew says, "Rather be a Se-mon—an able Semon—than
a Sea-Lord." Must say Semon did my throat lot of good. Andrew recommended
him. Nioe of Andrew. Brasset, recurring to my remark about Sea-Lord,
says " he's not a Sea-Lord now," and adds that "he's really afraid I haven't
yet quite grasped the principle upon which that little slip"
Esoape to masthead. Spend first happy time on board over perusal of pocket
edition of Gleanings.
Near Norway.—Much better. Take opportunity (when Andrew Clark gone
on shore) to sound Ship's-Cook on how he intends voting in November. Says he
"hain't made up his mind yet." What will decide him, I ask P He replies,
"It's according as his Skipper tells him to wote," and winks. Give him copy of
Corrupt Practices Act, and make short address to Sailors generally on duty of
voting for Liberals. Steersman oomes down to listen, and vessel nearly wrecked.
Brasset very angry. Soothe him by saying that the error about the half-million
"is of no consequence." Bbasset seems immensely relieved.
Andrew come on board. "Then comes my fit again!" Tell him I've made a
speech to Sailors, and try to make him take humorous view of the matter by
calling it a " feat on the fiord." Andrew threatens to " turn Tory " if I do this
sort of thing again, and says he won't be responsible for consequences. Well,
he '11 have greater freedom if he has less responsibility, I tell him.
After a Week's Cruising.—Feel quite myself again! Hurrah! Asked
Brasset why Tory Party is like an Irishman who takes farm of evicted
tenant? "Beoause it wants Protection." Riddle poor, but shows I'm
better. Wire to Chamberlain that my "vocal powers quite restored."
He wires back that in that oase our Party will soon be "restored to
power," and "will I give 'em another Midlothian oampaign?" Think on the
whole that I will.
[And let us hope his health will be equal to it.

SONG OF A SLOW MOVEMENT.
(By a Suburban Citizen.)

My omnibus ere I can cheek,
I dash, at hazard, o'er and o'er.
It suits the olasses who can pay
Cab-hire, to have—I envy not
The millionnaires their happier
lot—
A cab at elbow all their way.
waiting for my
'bus, I stand.
About five-thirty,
frequent, fast,
The vehicles whirl
westward, past
The southern kerb-
stone of the
Strand.
In matting-basket
borne, I fetch
Down home, per-
chance, a bit of
fish,
And serve, mean-
while, againstmy
wish,
Some lively limner
for a sketch.
A 'bus all red and
gold comes on!
Mine likewise
bears those co-
lours bright.
Cab following cab
impedes my
sight—
I fail to read—the
'bus is gone!
'Twixt lazy craw-
lers, and before
The heads of
horses, risking
wreck,
But let blue Robert intervene;
So far as is in fairness meet,
And bid the Crawlers on his
beat
Crawl on with gangways clear
between.
CARDSTEFS JOTTINGS.
De Mortuis.
The Cardtteps Chronicle was very badly in want of a smart
Reporter when young Style appeared in the little town. Cardsteps
is not a town wherein much interest is taken in anything; all
England rang with the massacre of Berber before we learnt the news,
and when it arrived there were so few of us aware of the locality of
Berber, that it faded into nothing before the bellman's announcement
of the discovery of a purse on the sands the previous evening.
But even in Cardsteps it was thought that the Chronicle was
behind the times. Garden, who was Editor, Reporter, and Adver-
tising Canvasser, was universally allowed to be brilliant, but
eccentric Strangers might ask in vain for proofs of the former, but
as a sign of his eocentricity he could be pointed out sound asleep
under alcoholic influence on a bench on the parade six afternoons of
the week. On the Sunday he remained in bed all day, exposing him'
self thereby to the awful penalties of an excommunication, that is if
a certain Norfolk Parson were his rector. Then the landlord of the
"Gunboat" stopped his credit, alleging that his account had run quite
long enough. Unluckily, he took this step on a publishing day, and
Garden, smarting under his wrongs, and suffering from an unquenoh-
able thirst, denounced the "Gunboat" as the home of smugglers,
and spoke of the landlord as being the most dangerous foe the Coast
Guard had to contend with.
It was a spirited article, and sent the journal up no less than ten
copies, but if it hadn't been for the proprietor promptly ordering
three dozen bottles of soda-water, a demand whioh for a while utterly
paralysed the resources of the "Gunboat," an action for libel could
not have been avoided.
The climax came when the grocer's daughter was married to a
lawyer from. London. Everybody put on their best clothes, and
attended the ceremony; everybody yearned to see their names in
print as having been present at the smartest wedding known for
years; and with this aim everybody treated Garden with such
liberal cordiality that he fell that
into the hands of an
alien policeman, and was ensconced in the lock-up, when he should
have been at his desk. The paper appeared without a word as to
the marriage. Public opinion then unmistakably said that Garden
must go. He went, and a complimentary banquet was given to him
as a fellow-townsman, and a man of letters. The evening ended
with four fights, and to this day the purveyor of the feast does not
know whom to sue for the meal.
Style drifted into Cardsteps at the very nick of time. The Mayor
of the adjacent town of Tugsdom was just dead, and Style, in a
humble way, had been a personal friend of the deceased official, and
was necessarily well qualified to write his obituary. Moreover, his
coat was singularly shiny, his linen was particularly frayed; and
although his boots were scarcely calculated to keep the water out, it
was astonishing, on a wet day, what a quantity they retained.
It was with a light heart that the proprietor left his young recruit
to write a two-column article on the late Mayor, and to bring out
the current number of the Cardsteps Chronicle. He was less cheer-
ful when he read his own paper the next morning. Dubiousness
changed to positive certainty, when he encountered his subscribers;
and when the Mayor's relatives—the deceased was a wine-and-spirit
merchant, in a large way of business, and always good for half a
column a week—sent over a letter brimful of rage, withdrawing the
firm's advertisement for ever, absolute wrath seized the proprietor,
and he sent for his subordinate. Style apologetically said that what
he had written was entirely from his personal knowledge.
"But you have said that ' to shock his personal vanity it was only
necessary to allude to the wart on the left side of his nose.'"
"Perfectly true; it used to make him mad."
"But you oughtn't to have said so. And then you remark 1 his
ostentatious liberality in public was only equalled by his private
niggardliness.'"
"That's also true; he used to pretty nearly starve his family and
servants.'"
"But suoh things should never be printed. What right have you
to state that' though the ostensible cause of death is given as bron-
chitis, it is an undoubted fact that it was in the main due to excessive
consumption of his own goods'"?
"What right P The doctor told me so himself. It is eighteen
months since he taid the old fool was drinking himself to death."
"Now, once and for all understand me, or else you'll follow
Garden. Attack the living as much as you like, when they deserve
it, when they don't agree with our viewB, or don't advertise in our
paper. But remember De mortuis nil nisi bonum."
Style accordingly set to work on the de mortuis line, and his
eulogy on the village idiot would .have been excessively fulsome if
applied to a Burns or a Byron. And he did not scruple to attack
the living. His description of his proprietor's foremost opponent on
the Local Board as "a verminiferous black-beetle wriggling on the
point of a pin," was considered a masterpiece of delicate humour by
all save the gentleman of whom it was written, who, meeting the
proprietor of the Chronicle at the Railway Station, first knocked his
hat over his eyes, and then kicked him down the steps with such
vigour that he was in bed for three weeks. During this period Style
had full control over the paper, and upheld his master s views with
such loyal zeal, that on every publication day little crowds used to
waylay the doctor, and shake thick sticks with a scornful air when
they gathered that his patient would not be yet out and about.
But it was kindness that caused Style's downfall. The city which
domineered over this part of the country, the City of St. Precincts,
had, in addition to one of the noblest cathedrals in England, an
elegant and commodious county gaol. Great had been the excite-
ment, even the pulse of Cardsteps had fully throbbed, over a local
murder, and when the doer of the deed had been sentenced to be
hanged, great was the rivalry, and fierce the competition to obtain a
view of the execution. By some means the Chronicle got a ticket,
and Style naturally undertook the task of reporting the scene. His
article was really admirable. His description of the gloomy fastness,
of the doomed man's walk to the scaffold, of his frightened eyes, of
his blanched faoe, was a model of word-painting.
Ably, too, had Style retold the Btory of the murder; the mad-
dened ruffian's beating his wife's head in with the poker, his holding
his infant baby on the fire, his cutting his three elder children's
throats from ear to ear, and his smothering his aged mother, were all
gems of crime-pictures. And then Style concluded—" But let us
throw no stone at the man who this morning expiated for his crime
with his life on the scaffold. Those who knew him best will long
miss his hearty genial ways, his honest ringing laugh. An admirable
son, a devoted husband, and a loving father has passed away from
us. Let us remember his best qualities, and forget his little faults
and weaknesses. De mortuis nil nisi bonum."
That brought the proprietor from his bed, and sent Style out of
the county. We hear nothing positive of him now at Cardsteps, but
it is rumoured that he is either attached to the poetry staff of a great
| tooth-powder-making firm, or engaged on making the fortune of a
I London newspaper.

YACHTING.
Illustrated by Dumb-Crambo Junior.

A Loose Sheet.
Short Maimed.
VERT WELL OUT OP IT;
Or, Finishing Up at Portsmouth.
Thb Lords of the Admiralty, whose recent heroic movements in
the neighbourhood of Portsmouth have been duly ohronicled in the
columns of the daily Press, again continued and finally concluded
their exciting tour of inspection yesterday, under even still more
novel and interesting conditions. It having been arranged that, in
addition to their previous experiences, all more or less calculated to
familiarise them with the practical details of their official work, they
should still further be subjected to the personal inconvenience atten-
dant on a night-attack by an enem> "supposed to be in full force,
supported by a torpedo squadron on three sides ; " their Lordships,
after having retired to 'est at their several hotels, were suddenly
roused, and hurried off with scarcely time to dress comfortably, in one
or two steam pinnaces, waiting to take them to the scene of action.
This feat was courteously but efficiently accomplished by the con-
troller, who, notwithstanding the apparent lack of interest shown by
some of the official party, who were at first huddled rather sleepily
and unceremoniously i ito the stern, managed by the judicious use of
the eleotrio-light and ateam-whistle combined with the cold morning
air, and an occasions, wash of spray, to excite their nagging interest
in the nature of '.iie important manoeuvre in which they found
themselves engaged.
The attack naving been, after a good two hours' heavy shrapnel
Eaotice in the dark, "repulsed," their Lordships, who were now
irly awake, expressed their entire satisfaction with the proceed-
ings, and were about to return to their respective hotels to finish
their night's rest, when the Admiral, who had prepared a pleasant
surprise for them, in the shape of a morning cruise in the new patent
"rocking" vessel, Tumbler, designed for the purpose of accustoming
Admirals on the Half-Pay List to recover, in any emergency, the use
of their sea-legs, cleverly intercepted them.
Taken at a brisk rate some ten miles out and home again, their
Lordships, who were thus enabled before breakfast to experience all
the sensations common to a severe Channel passage, on leaving the
ingeniously-oontrived craft, again expressed their entire satisfaction,
ana were looking anxiously for some conveyance to carry them in
the direction of the town, when they were met by the Surveyor of
Dockyards, who at once suggested an inspection of the proposed site
for the Marine Bowling-Green, about which there had been consider-
able difference of opinion, and which happened to be not more than
two miles and a half distant from the spot where they had been
landed.
On their way to the proposed site their Lordships had, moreover,
the opportunity of trying the new Macpherson iron-clad fire-escape,
that in action is meant to facilitate the safety of combatants leaving
a sinking ship, and in time of peace can be utilised as a series of
douche baths, supplied with hot or cold water as inclination or neces-
sity may direct.
Their Lordships having experienced the efficacy of this admirable
new invention in both capacities, the First Lord, who said he
thought that he might possibly be recalled to town immediately,
was about to signal by heliograph for a four-wheeler from Upnor,
when the official party were again taken off bodily, though this time

not without some slight protest, to inspect the bursting of obsolete
muzzle-loaders by the new heavy ordnanoe oharges at the open
practice-grounds at the back of Whale Island. Having witnessed
these interesting experiments for some considerable time in a somno-
lescent condition, it was now announced to their Lordships, who had
to be awakened with a fog-signal, that the Enchantress was in Bight,
upon which, after they had expressed the greatest satisfaction at this
intelligence, they made a hurried rally for the landing-stage, and,
Bjpite the almost active intervention of the Colonel, acting as deputy-
director of works, who obstinately insisted on their seeing some
mortar practice, managed ultimately, after a prolonged altercation
ending in a somewhat unseemly scuffle, to get once again safely on
board their own yacht.
Their Lordships attended the official dinner given by the Admiral
Commander-in-Chief in the evening, but left early, in several
batohes, for unknown destinations, without leaving any addresses.
The proposed "supplementary night surprise," planned for their
speoial entertainment after the oonolusion of the Seamen and Marines
Orphan ABylum Ball, will, it is rumoured, in consequenoe possibly
hang fire.
A DISENCHANTED CASTLE.
"To be Sold" an old Castle of feudal renown;
For its Lords, well-a-day! in the world have gone down;
And their latest descendant, who
haply can't let,
Has concluded to sell it for what
he can get.
It dates back to the dark days, on
History's page,
Of the bows, and the bills, and
the battle-axe age.
'Tis a massive, stone-built, medi-
aeval stronghold,
And a family seat, and it's now
to be sold!
On View. bears bulwarks and battle-
ments, turrets and towers,
That stand, fast as live rocks, all the storms and the showers,
On its walls there's a " weeping-stone," no one knows why,
Which is dry in damp weather, and dripping in dry.
It has dungeons, a chamber where mur-
der, of yore,
Hath left blood-stains, which won't be
washed out of the floor,
And a room with a seoret that ne'er must
be known,
As 'twould carry a terrible curse were it
"blown."
Up and down the grand staircase, at
times to be seen,
A speotral " Green Lady " walks, grue-
some and green,
Whioh betokens that somebody's going
to die;
'Tis a notioe to quit—a memento morl.
There's a ban on the building; the tale
goes that ne'er
Within those old walls will be born a
male heir
Till a spell shall be broken; and, sooth, it appears
No such boy has been born there for five hundred years.
This ancestral old Keep, with the
broad lands that lie
All around it, Sir Goegius Midas
may buy,
Though he drop all his aitches,
he '11 be a fine host,
Lay wagers, lay wine down,—
will he lay the Ghost?
Oh, the weeping-stone, then will
it weep any more?
Will the stains still refuse to
come out of the floor?
Will the Green Lady warn the
smug Millionnaire?
And how about Gosoius Minus's
heir?

BUMBLE TO THE BEEFEATER.

I've been reading in the paper, Mr. Beefeater, as how
The Lord Chamberlain is having of a game with yon jest now,
And is doing of his best to make you look a rummy card.
Much more like a prison-warder than a Yeoman of the Ouard.
'Twai the Liberals—or Bobbt Lowe at least—as I've heard say,
In a lit of publio-spirited economy one day
On the 'andsome silver badge upon your arm who made a pounce,
And then sold it to a silversmith at four-and-two the bounce.
Shortly arter, bit by bit, they took away your swagger olo'es,
First your doublet, then your ruff, and then your plummy damask hose,
Gave you bluchers for to wear, instead of brilliant buckle shoes,
Put you into wulgar trousers and a pennytenshal blouse.
Last of all, I'm told, the Chamberlain—a Tory, by the way—
Has deprived you of your velvet cap, that used to look so gay,
And bestowed on you a " pattern-hat" some Army-tailor chose,
Sech as farmers sticks up on a pole to scare away the crowB.
"Wrongs like yours, my ill-used Yeoman, Bumble's sympathy may claim,
And he pities you sincerely in your sorrow and your shame;
But you ain't the honly tiptop hinstitooshun in the land
Upon which the low hiconoclask has laid his sordid hand.
Look at Me! Why, bless your 'eart, it ain't so wery long ago
That my duds was jest as spiff as any London had to show;
I looked down with 'aughty scorn upon the Harmy and Perlice,
And was quite as big a toff as what the Frenchies call a " Sweess."
But them fellers in the Tress, as always prates about Reform,
For porochial hinstitooshuns made it most uncommon warm,
And partiklerly for me and other Beadles, whom they classed
With " the useless, bloated relics of a quaint barbaric past."
I was wrote of as " the stupidest anomaly e'er seen,"
And a vile anakrinizzum—whatsoever that may mean—
Till the Vestrymen got frightened, and decided it was best
That the splendours of the Beadle should be totally suppressed.
So they cruelly despiled me of my three-caped rockylore,
Of the buckles and the " shorts" that on my nether-man I wore,
Of the hat, thrioe-cooked and laced with gold, that was
my special pride,
And the silver-topped rattan with which the boys Iused
to hide.
Thus transformed into the despicable hobjeok that you
I stand gazing on the picter of the swell I used to be;
And I feels.oonwinoed Old England must be going to the
dogs,"
When her Beefeaters and Beadles has to wear sech
common togs.
"VILLANY TRIUMPHANT."
In the new melodrama, Hoodman Blind, at the Prin-
oess's Theatre, the Villain of the pieoe obtains the entire
sympathy of the audience in oonsequence of the vengeance
meted out to him by the hero. One of the Authors (Mr.
Jones) some little while ago leotured and wrote about
the Mission of the Dramatist, which seemed in his opinion
to be closely allied to that of the preaoher. So be it.
But surely this is a new departure? Villany is acous-
tomed to be hissed through three Acts of a pieoe while
employed in successful fraud, and in the fourth to die,
defeated in the end, amidst the jeers of a tcomful and
exultant Gallery. But with Mr. Jones's Hoodman Blind
as a model, the end of a play will be in future something
like the following, whioh we publish as a guide for young
dramatists in general, and Messrs. Boucicault, Sims,
and Mekhitt in particular :—
Scene—The Zoological Gardens. Enter Villain,
exultingly. He lookt at hit Watch.
Villain. In ten minutes' time she will be here, and
then away to Italy with his bride, and a fortune of ten
thousand a year! How my plans have prospered! The

my grandfather. It was a olever thought to scuttle the

Enter Constable, who seizes Villain and takes him into
custody.
Villain (struggling). In the hands of the law! My
name dishonoured, my memory a disgrace! Never!
(Suddenly takes poison.) I can but die! (Turns up his
eyes to the flies.) Forgiveness!
[Dies. Immense applause from the audience.
Hero (embracing Heroine, who has rushed in). My
own, my love! Never to part again!
[Dead silence from the audience. Curtain. Loud
calls for the Villain, who is enthusiastically
cheered on his appearance. Moral.—Doubtful!
Eh? - The representatives of the Shipping Interest speak
of Mr. Chamberlain as a " reckless politician." Can this
be because he is in favour of a " wreok-less" polioy?

THE ROWERS OH THE LEA.
(Air—" The Miller on the Dec")
There went a party fortk to row
Upon the River Lea;
They started off as blithe as larks,
And sang most merriW;
And this the burden of their eong
For ever used to be—
""We envy nobody in the world,
But dorit they envy we 1"
",You 're wrong, my friends!" the
Boatman cried,
"As wrong as wrong can be;
No boating now is to be had
Upon the River Lea,
The fishing too has gone to grief,
The anglers sniff—and flee;
And why P Because the stream 's a
sewer,
As you will shortly see."
The party laughed in merry soorn,
They took a boat so free;
"We love to row," they all declared,
"Whate'er the water be,
No noisome odours shall prevent
Our vespertinal spree;
It is the Londoner's delight,
This limpid Kiver Lea!"
Alas! "Within a brief half-hour,
They sang, but not in glee,
"We envy folk upon the bank,
But they don't envy we!
For why? We feel inclined to faint,
We 're sick as sick can be;
We've all got germs of Typhoid from
This rowing on the I,ea!"
THE S. A. MANCEUVRES.
[From Our Own Correspondents.)
A brisk engagement has occurred
between the Derby Corps of the Sal-
vation Army and a body of insurgents.
There seems to have been serious
fighting.
Army accused of making an undue
use of their band in kicking up a row.
Summonses issued against some of
them for disturbing the peaoe; the
Authorities not recognising their olaim
to belligerent rights.
Last night the Corps made another
demonstration. Were followed to the
market-place by tag-rag-and-bobtail,
whose movement was, in the mean-
while, confined to a reconnaissance.
The Salvationeers, arriving on that
ground, one of their mounted officers
thook a stick at the police. Signal for
commencement of hostilities. The
Corps immediatelyoharged by the mob,
their drum smashed, their infantry
bonneted, their cavalry pulled to the
ground, and their squad in general
scattered. Corps fallen back on bar-
racks, bombarded by orowd, flinging
addled eggs and dead cats, throwing
stones and smashing windows. Tre-
mendous uproar.
The elite of the Salvation Army
constitute a crack regiment, entitled
the " Salvation Life Guards."
Have the Salvationist forces any
"Sappers and Miners "? We are not
aware, but their silly and ridiculous
demonstrations tend altogether to sap
and undermine, if not to revolt, every
idea of reverence. Their perform^
ances in the streets with their ban-
ners, drams, and tambourine girls
are, in fact, only fit for a Booth.
Well—save us from the Salvationists!

If Sir Richard Cross, our new Not-at-all-at-Home Secretary, had stopped it at the outset,
we should have been spartd the spectacle of an eminent Cardinal, an Archbishop, some Bishops, and
Clergy, all with their fingers in a mud-pie. Scarcely a journal appears without some report, or para-
graph, about Societies for the Protection of Girls, while so-called "religious papers " recommend the
establishment everywhere of Vigilance Committees. If this state of things continues, we shall need
several well-organised Societies for the Protection of Men to guard "man, poor man," against such
evil-speaking, lying, slandering, and black-mailing, as will be engendered by these Schools for

Vigilance Committees can only exist where the Law is powerless. The public has been favoured with
some very clear expositions of the moral views of these self-eleoted Custodians, and the Armstrong
case afforded sufficient ground for the intervention of the Strong Arm of the Law.

and, possibly, the chanoe of the would-be M.P. Whether

THE TALE OF A WHALE.
I stood by Waterloo Bridge the other afternoon, watching the
argosies of British commerce passing swiftly to and fro on the water
highway of the world, feeling pride in the spectaole, yet regret that
a parsimonious and pusillanimous Government permitted these
vessels to venture afar without any protection. Here were trim,
taut steamers, with low hulls and rakish funnels, bound with fifty
or sixty human lives, and at least a dozen or two of bottled beer, for
Pimlico Pier. There larger craft, but still built in the same beautiful
lines, were preparing for further and more dangerous journeys; the
passengers on which were fully prepared for the time and difficulties
before them, for while some, braving the fierce high winds which on
the calmest day elsewhere for ever swirl and sway round the Cathe-
dral of St. Paul, were purchasing boxes of fusees, so as not to be
dependent on the fickle match for their ignition of tobacco, others,
mindful of the long and weary delays that would inevitably ensue
ere they bumped Blackwall Pier, stepped on board with a perfect
library in the shape of the day's Daily Telegraph. A sight calcu-
lated to arouse one's pride, yet at the same time bitter regret, when
one thought what havoe, in case of war, a few fast cruisers might
inflict on this superb fleet.
I stood not alone regarding this scene. Passionately fond of the
sea as I am, ever since my people, calling a spade a spade, had called
me a young rake, and had sent me to the Hoe of Plymouth, there to
sink or swim, I yet do not monopolise all regard for the ocean, and
I soon became aware of a figure by my side contemplating the busy
movements of the magnificent vessels. He was an old man, in a
faded blue suit, with red half-closed eyes, a bulbous nose, and
blotchy cheeks, which at onoe betrayed his calling. Show me such a
man anywhere, and I would at once say that he was accustomed to
an ocean—of liquor.
"Purty, ain't it ?" he asked, commencing the conversation, and
my heart at onoe warmed towards the old familiar accents which
betokened a man acquainted with the three seas. Tes, all the great
seas—the C. C. C. I returned in the affirmative, and he went on :—
"But, lawks, what a deal of fuss is made about these 'ere tin
kettles, for that they are nothing more or less! Ah, it was a bit
different when we had sailing weasels, and didn't knowhothingabout
these 'ere craft. Steam, they says, was in its infancy then. Well, I
only wishes that infant had been entrusted to the care of a baby farm."
Suoh sentiments, so similar to those which I have promulgated so
often in public and private, at onoe induced me to ask this son of the
sea whether he had any objection to join me in a friendly glass.
"None whatever: he would ioin me in several," was his eminently
sailorly reply, and then, with the keen true instinct of a mariner
who knows upon what little chances his dangerous calling turns,
added, " and in smokes." So saying, he led the way to a neighbour-
ing hostelry frequented by seamen, the very name of which, "The
Romanocian," smacked of the sea. And those who were refreshing
themselves within spoke in nautical phrases, alluding to having been
half seas over the night before, and of having had a storm with their
wives, and of feeling perfect wrecks this day; their favourite hero
and heroine were Captain Crosstree and Dolly Mayflower^ but as I
never once heard, the command given, "Starboard," so did I never
hear anyone order " Port."
Having placed refreshments before and within my friend, he
commenced,—
"They scientific coves and folks up at the Admiralty talks about
the superior rate of progression that is obtained nowadays by steam.
But it makes one ill to hear them a going on. Now how long do you
suppose it takes one of them vessels to get down to Southend Pier P"
I answered—" Five, six, seven hours, as the case might be."
"Exactly. There you nave it in a moment with your calculating
figure-head.. Well, I have sailed it—sailed it in three-quarters of
an hour 1 You may well look surprised; but what I am telling you's
Gospel truth. It is some many years ago now, and there's me and
my mate, Joe Blocklf.y, one of the smartest lads that ever handled
a tiller or a till—rather too smart, the Judge, a land-lubbing chap in
a wig, said over the latter job as he give him two with,—and he

■ailed from London Bridge one day in one^of the liveliest craft that
ever gladdened the eyes of a real, genuine salt. (Certainly I will,
and enough after that.) Well, we weren't long in getting into the
Pool. _ But the Pool ain't what it was, is it. Sir?"
Seeing it was expected of me, I answered in the negative.
"Pool!" he continued; "Pool! I remember when one could piok
'em up at thirty shillings a time, and last night I had to divide one of
four-and-six. But to get back to the voyage. As soon as we got
into the Pool, we saw that for the best part of our voyage, whioh
was to Barking Creek, we should have a nead-wind. Not that we
cared, for we were, as I said before, in one of the tautest crafts that
was ever afloat. From her upper stern-piece to her transom she was
a marvel. When she had got ner moonraker, her lee-brails, and her
stanchions all afloat, you couldn't have imagined a prettier sight,
and than her jib-halliards and her trysail no better lines ever out
through the water. But then we were almost a-calm. Joe cast
anxious looks at the compasses—the Ooat and Compasses, for he owed
a small score there, and was afeard that they might put off in a boat
and ask for it, but we were spared that danger by getting under the
weather-bow of a coal-barge who had lost ner spinnaker-boom in a
late gale. Still we got no forarder. We was a-sitting idly there,
and thinking maybe how foolish we had been to leave our homes, for
sailors thinks at times, when suddenly we felt a shock.
"' What's that P' sang out I.
"'How the devil should I know?' sung out he; and with this
mutual confidence I leant forward aft to see what it was, but in a
moment afterwards I was in the bottom of the boat, and we were
tearing down the river far quicker than even in my wildest dreams
I had believed it possible to go. Talk of steamers—bah! Talk of
railway trains—we beat one which was going down to Erith by ten
miles in eleven. Lawks, I confess now how frightened we both
were, for you see there was the wind dead agin us, and there were
we going at a rate of speed which I can't think can have been less
than seventy knots an hour.
"Everything, of course, going agin a head-wind at this rate was
carried away, off flew our boom, away in the air went the gaff, over
went the companion. How things did fly past us. Say Jack Robin-
son! and we was at Greenhithe, we had not time to yell when we had
cut an emigrant ship in two, and down she went with all hands. Eh,
it would have been a pitiful sight could we have seen it, for the poor
folks had all their little worldly possessions on board, it being just
before quarter-day, and they a-moving all their possessions unbe-
known to their Landlord, from Gravesend over to Tilbury in Essex,
but we was down Long Reach pretty nigh before we were through the
two halves of the dinghy, for such was the rig of the emigrants ship,
then the Chapman and the Mucking Lights, like the two posts of a
narrow gate, and Southend Pier was right upon us.
"So rapid had been our flight, that the breath was knocked right
out of Joe, and he fell heavily on the tiller, shoving it hard a-star-
board. That saved our lives. The boat slowly obeyed the helm, and
a slant of air coming from the Medway drove us straight on to Leigh
shore. It is not often that a sailor cares for a lee-shore; but if ever
two men did bless one, those two men were Joe and myself. We
gazed at each other silently, and I could see Joe's face was all white
and strained as if with great pain, whioh, seeing as how he had hit
the tiller with his funny bone, was not to be wondered at. As for
myself, I don't know now I looked. Certainly, one doesn't get
tipple like it every day, but I didn't feel so comfortable as I do now.
'What water is there?' I asked Joe, hoarsely. I know it was
hoarsely, having done little for a week before but spend the profits
of our last cruise on gin. 1 Three foot,' he answered.
"' Thank Heavens!' I could not help exclaiming, for I knew that
we only drew six inches, and were safe when we struck, but not
hard, as one would on a beach, but soft, as on the mud. We both
jumped overboard as we were, and examined the keel_ of our craft
from the vangs to the buntlines. And what do you think it was all
about, this 'ere sailing express against the wind, and striking when
we had no business to strike?" I could give no guess, enthralled
as I had been in this tale of the sea.
"Why,the weather had been a bit stormy for some time, whioh
always drives birds and fishes up the river. And what we hit in the
Pool was a whopping big porpoise. The keel of our boat was a bit
gone, and the iron had got entangled with that porpoise's fins, and
he had had to drag us the whole way down. Swims fast they always
do; with the agony of the pain he swam doubly quick. We took
him ashore easy enough, for he was spent now, and each of us had a
pair of boots made out of his skin, which mine only went to be soled
and heeled last Tuesday, or I would show them to you as a proof of
my story. So when folks talk of steam, I think of my ride on a por-
poise, which I have never told anyone before, and don't fancy I shall
find anybody likely to listen to me again. Good day, Sir."
"Good day 1" And I sat pondering over the strange weird
adventures encountered by men of the sea, just as other guests didn't
sit, but stood up and walked about, profanely wondering why the
disappearance of my old truthful salt had been simultaneous with
the disappearance of their umbrellas and walking-stioks!
THE AMATEUR YACHTSMAN.
A NatUical Song of the Period,

sailing,
Bat please understand I ne'er lose sight of land,
Though hardier sailors are railing.
If only the ship, that's the Yacht, wouldn't dip,
Ana heel up and down and roll over,
And wobble about till I want to get out,
I >d think myself fairly in clover.
But, bless you! my craft, though the wind is abaft,
Will stagger when meeting the ripple.
Until a man feels both his head and his heels
Reversed as if full of his tipple.
In vain my blue serge when from seas we emerge,
Though dressed as a nautical dandy;
I can't keep my legs, and I call out for " pegs"
Of rum, or of soda and brandy.
A Yacht is a thing, they say, fit for a king,
And still it is not to my liking;
My short pedigree does not smack of the Sea,—
I oan't pose a bit like a Viking.
It's all very well when there isn't a swell,
But when that comes on I must toddle
And go down below, for a bit of a blow
Upsets my un-nautioal noddle.
Britannia may rule her own waves,—I'm a fool
To try the same game, but, believe me,
Though catching it hot, yet to give up my " Yot"
Would certainly terribly grieve me.
You see, it's the rage, like the Amateur Stage,
Or Coaching, Lawn-Tennis, or Hunting;
So, though I'm so queer, I go Yaohting each year,
And hoist on the Solent my bunting.
Strictly Impartial.

WHO WOULDN'T BE A DRAWING-MASTER!
THE IRREPRESSIBLE TOURIST.
"Oh, where shall we go P" That's the annual ory
Of your regular commonplace Tourist. Then why
Should this Tourist of Tourists not raise it?
A right thorough-going, untiring globe-trotter,
No poor Paterfamilias he just to potter,
Mo 'Abut whose verdict is " Margit's my motter I"
No Matron long balanced 'twixt colder and hutur.
The world is his home. He surreys it,
Like Pistol of old, as his oyster, a thing
To be opened up, prior to gulping. His fling
He must have, our unlimited Tourist.
Attired, like a gentleman taking the air,
In a suit of check dittos, the usual pair
Of long-sighted lorgnons, perusing with care
His guide-books and maps, take a look at him there
As Autolycus sharp though—to doubt it who '11 dare P—
With motives the highest and purest.
Still, if any small " unconsidered trifles"
Of land lie about, which one's rum and one's rifles
May help to " snap up," why, one's scruples one stifles,
Or how would the world get along?
In the race of land-grabbing 'tis fatal to lag,
The last in the field get the least of the swag.
No prior possessor who lets his tongue wag,
No " harmless hidalgo" uplifting a flag,
No friend of humanity—wanting a gag—
Who prattles of right and of wrong,
May stop that grave goddess called " National Progress,"
Whom prudes and precisians regard as an ogress,
Bat whose most majestical stride,
In spite of all humanitarian rumpusses,
Is steady and sweeping as Hadrian's compasses."
Our Tourist looks forth far and wide,
Like Little BiUee from the main-top, and " spots"
Most " commanding" sites, most " desirable lots,
Charming " sea-side resorts," many snug "building-plots,"
And ne says, with a confident smile, and
A wink of the eye, "I'm prospecting! I see
There 'a still many a plaoe will do nicely for me,
Full many a land-nook as snug as can be,
And many a tight little island.
Where shall I go next P Well my excellent friends
My reply to your query must be 'That depends I'
IJiave oathoho tastes, and to farther my ends
I may have to be rather ubiquitous.
I'm not at all greedy, you've all had your share.
I oome in for the scraps, what my neighbours can spare,
Just a little bit here and a little bit there,
Can anything be less iniquitous P"
Why no, to be sure, there is room for us all,
To check the stout Teuton John Bull has no call,
But—those who are blindest are nearest a fall,
And those who see sharpest securest.
Trespass? A game he, of course, will not try on,
And therefore won't mind if the old British Lion
Should keep a quite friendly but vigilant eye on
This most Irrepressible Tourist!
OUT OF THE WEY1
That pretty little stream, the Wey, is, it appears, earning the
name of " the Styx of Surrey." That is a pity. Many a disciple of
old Izaak has passed many a happy hour watching the " bobbing of
the float" in the bright river that meanders through the green Surrey
meadows—though sometimes that delightful "hob" is somewhat
spoilt by the neighbouring " tanner," with his ancient but not fish-
like (or fish-liked) savour.
"There were three jolly Anglers, they
Went Sailing for the roach on the bunks of the Wey.
And they went down to supper at the sign of the 1 Parrot,'
And they had boiled beef without any carrot,"
as we once heard a trio of warbling Waltonians piping pleasantly as
they plodded towards Guildford. Where there's a will there 'a a
way, and the will of the genial Ouildf ordites ought to be to make
their Wey clean and clear—though straight it can never be, thanks
to tweet Nature's happy love of the serpentine.

Its proof needs no haranguer;
Whether, as vouched for, 'tis

JUST ANOTHER SNIFF.
A Coebsspondent, signing himself "J. B. G.," wrote to the
Times to show that in Mad Salad Market everything that is possible
to be done has been, in his opinion, done, and that Covent Garden is
as near an Eden as anything in this metropolitan world can be. He
did not deny that" during the day the market is, more or less, strewn
with vegetable matter "—evidently to him a mere trifle. But he airily
adds, "If strangers to the neighbourhood were to visit it after business
is over, they would be surprised at its cleanliness, and on Sundays
they would not know the place."
Yes, only "strangers to the neighbourhood " would be likely to visit
it " after business is over," and then they wouldn't come a second time
in a hurry. "On Sundays they would not know the place "—how
could they, if they were " strangers P" But visit it during business
hours, be there on any Friday night and Saturday morning, or on most
mornings for the matter of that, and how the stranger will revel in
the delights with which three out of his five senses will be regaled.
How pleased he will be to be detained in this Garden of sweet odours
by the obstructing carts, specially if his Cabman has chosen this route
as the shortest and quickest between anywhere and a Railway Station.
How full of charming excitement, too, is the attempt at landing at
any of the Hotel-doors, and what a store of fun may be laid by for
pantomime time from the presence of vegetable slides on the pavement.
And on the ornaments of speech!
"The refuse of the market is swept up and carted away every
evening," say s this same letter-writer to the Timet. So it ought to be.
But where is it carted to P Bedford Street P Garrick Street? and some
of the other favoured streets round about, to await parochial aetion?
Mud-salad may be very nice for late breakfast or early lunch, but
Mr. Punch, speaking from experience of having had it occasionally
served up under his bold Soman nose, is inclined to fanoy that a great
liking for the delicacy must be quite an acquired taste. Luckily,
Mr. Punch can "hold his own'' anywhere, and he did (as regards
his nose) on these occasions. But could he hold his peace?
The Duke, we hear, is going to enlarge the Garden—some of the
old hotels are coming down. Good—but will enlarging the Garden
diminish the nuisance P If fruit, flowers, and vegetables must be
mixed, treble the space, and let the market be carried on under such
conditions as will make one condition—its present one—impossible.
There has been, we are glad to hear, some improvement. Fortunate
indeed is it that there is no epidemio; but we can answer for one
thing, in view of the letters we receive from " round and about that
quarter," that there are no end of " complaints."
A Cry from Kent.
Pbospeeity 'a fled from our gardens and grounds;
How spindly our bines and how scanty our orops 1
Wealth may be "advancing by leaps and by bounds,"
It certainly isn't by Hope!

THE AGRICULTURAL QUESTION.
Mr. Punch, Sir,
Several of my friends and me has just got votes for the fast
time, and as we don't know what on earth to do with 'em, we have
all agreed to write to you, as the People's true friend, to ask for your
kind advice on the matter.
There's two gentlemen a coming round among ns, as polite as you
please, and a telling of as that it all depends upon us, and snohas as,
whether we are all to be so muoh better off than we was afore, or
ever so much worse. The first one is our Squire, and he tells as that
the late Government has brought things to that pass that all the Land-
lords and many of the Farmers of the Country is all a being ruined,
and that the only thing to save them and enable them to raise our
wages, is to put a tax upon Foreign Com and Foreign Meat. But when
we labourers gets a talking together, we don't see as there's much
signs of ruin up at the Hall, and if our wages are only a going to be
raised if bread and meat is to be made dearer, we don't tee that toe
shall be much bettered by that, but we think we see who will. Then
oomes the other Gent, who's a stranger to us. and he tells us that up
to the present time the Landlords have had all the plums out of the
pudding that our labour makes the land produce, and left us only
just enough of the remainder to keep body and soul together, which
we know Dy bitter experience to be about true, and that if the land
will not produce three profits, of which the Landlords have the
Lion's share, it will oertainly produce two, of which the Labourer
most have one, for though it is quite possible to do without Landlords,
it's quite impossible to do without ns. And he tells us something as
makes us open our eyes as well as our ears, and that is, that a Mr.
King has tried a experiment on a Farm in Wiltshire, which is some-
thing like this. He took a Farm of about 400 .acres, that was out of
cultivation, at about 18/». per acre rent, and he let the Labourers
ohoose two of their number to manage the Farm with his Bailiff, and
he stocked the Farm for them, and he told them that the first charge
on the Farm should be their wages, and the second charge should be
the rent, and the third charge should be a fair interest on the cost of
stocking the Farm, and that anything left should be divided among
them; and at the end of the year they each of them received seven
folden sovereigns, and each hod his goose for Michaelmas Day! And
e has since taken another Farm to be managed on the same terms.
And he says that the whole seoret of his success lies in this one fact:
that " no man will work for a master as he will work for himself."
And we all says, one and all, that truer words was never spoke by
mortal man! It's common sense and it's human nature. We all
believe that men don't do it in any other condition of life, and why
should Agricultural Labourers at say 14|». a week be expected to set
a sort of angelic example to all the rest of the world? We say at
once that they don't, and we may as well add that they won't.
Now then, Sir, we wants you to tell us whether we can trust that
what these two gentlemen tells us is true. 1st. Whether if we votes
for Squire he will, by getting a tax on Foreign corn and meat, get
our wages raised higher than the increased price we shall have to pay
for our bread and meat and beer. Secondly. Whether, if we votes
for the stranger gent, we shall ever have the opportunity of so im-
proving our condition, by getting, besides our wages, a share of what
the land will produce in consequence of our harder and heartier and
willinger labour, as to make our lives much more worth living than
they are now, by the knowledge that we shall have something to

Mr. Punch's Reply,
Fellow Labourers I
Mr. Punch is much pleased that yon should have sought his
advice under the peculiar circumstances in which you are placed.
Mr. Punch eschews mere Party Politics. But your questions soar
into a far higher region, namely, the consideration of the compara-
tive prosperity and contentment of the millions of men who devote
their lives to the cultivation of the soil of our beloved country. An
ordinary Judge generally declines to give his reasons for his judgment,
but as Mr. Punch is the one Judge from whose decisions there is no
appeal, he gives his unanswerable reasons for his irrevocable
judgment.
1st. If not only your Squire, but all the Squires in the United
Kingdom were to be made Members of Parliament, they would be
utterly unable to put a Tax upon the Food of the People without
creating a revolution.
So your Squire's statement is mere bunkum, and is not therefore to
be believed.
Secondly. Mr. Punch has inquired into the interesting account
of the experiment of the Patriot Eiso, and has every reason to
believe in its truth. And as what he has done, others,
similar conditions, can do, the Stranger, if elected, will, it is to be
hoped, imitate the example he has praised so highly, and go and do
likewise.
If, therefore, your inquiries lead you to place implicit trust in the
Stranger, then there can be no question as to which way your true
interest should prompt you to vote.

Supposing you was me,
And supposing we both was somebody else,

Canto I.—Poibsons D'Avhil.
Born on the first of April were they both,
My—may I call them heroes f Oar tale's threshold
Presents a stumbling-block. 1 should be loth
To seem invidious 1 May one fiction's mesh hold
Two heroes! Is Romance s law of growth
Thus violated F Let me take a fresh hold
Upon my theme, whioh promises some trouble—
Hippoorene sometimes leads to seeing double
As well as mere "four-half."—To carry on
A sentence thus from one verse to another
Looks awkward, but the business I'm upon
Involves a deal of incidental bother
Of that sort. I would emulate Byron.
(Please shift the aeoent.) Critics raise a pother
About Don Juan, but I mean to equal
That masterpiece. You '11 see it in the sequel.
A whole three-volume Novel writ in rhyme
I rather think should crown a Bard with glory.
Whibtlecrapt's wit shall be eclipsed this tune,
Beppo, old Pdlci's Mbrgante Maggiore
Will not be in it. The idea's sublime,
But somehow in the course of a long story
The Muse is apt to get a little murky
In meaning, and in measure somewhat jerky.
And yet this metre gives such splendid scope
For every sort of Bhowy oleverness;
Tart epigram and transcendental trope;
And if I sometimes get into a mess
With limping-lame line-endings, still I hope
To make, at least, as shining a success
Of novel-writing on this novel plan,
As with the Government of Hindostan.
Therefore, here goes! Where was I? Oh, I know:
April was hovering 'twizt a smile and tear,
(That's new and striking) when death hovered low
Betwixt two cradles and a single bier.
Old Janua Vitee had been huffed, and so
His mood was at the moment rather queer.
He has a temper, Mors, and if you vex it
He's very apt to hurry on your exit.
'Tis best to be on pleasant terms with him.
Or with your plans he play b at pitoh-and-toss;
Politeness costs you little—'tis his whim.
Ave, te salutamus Thanatos!
Comes very easy. If my meaning's dim,
And you to catch my drift are at a loss,
Enow that—in verse—you oan't get through a story
Without some Latin and much allegory.
Death is like Woman, wanton and caprioious,
In fact / think those artists mediaeval
In making Mors a male were injudioious.
Mighty is Art, but one must not reoeive all
Its types and figures, howsoe'er delicious,
Without investigation. I believe all
The naughty tricks Mortality plays the Human
Confirm my theory—that Death's a Woman I
One of the babes above referred to sprang
From an old raoe with this peculiarity;
It was its changeless destiny to Hang !—
A most unenviable raoial rarity.
It seemed a gallows shame—that sounds like slang!—
For one may say, with no great stretch of charity,
Scarce more than naif of them entirely merited
The dismal destiny they all inherited.
Many an old Fitzdotterel no doubt
Deserved to dance on nothing, and exhibit
His struggling form, amidst the Mob's mad shout,
On Tudor scaffold or on Georgian gibbet;
But caught like Absolom P lassoed by a soout?
Choked by a necktie whioh had charmed Beau Tibbkt?
These—all Fitzdotterel endings—seemed to be
Exceedingly bad jokes of Destiny I
So thonght old Edelweiss, a learned Teuton,
Who made heredity his favourite study.
Invited onoe Fitzdotterel moors to shoot on,
His powers of miss, his visage round and ruddy,
His learning, worthy of Laplace or Newton.
And a sweet knaok of brewing whiskey-toddy,
Endeared him so to the then heir, Lord Romii.lt,
That ever afterward the two loved ohummily.
Between his love for Romillt, and his yearning
To see his philsosophio theories verified,
Edelweiss halted. Strange that Love and Learning
Antagonise. The Teuton was quite terrified
To feel nis ouriosity keen and burning
(By self-reproach's flagellation scarified)
To learn if Romillt too would hang, contend
With his affeotion for his " noble friend."
And now that point was settled. Romillt's throat
Caught by a falling telegraph wire—enough!
Edelweiss dropped a tear, and made a note;
(Humanity is made of mingled Btuff.)
In that same hour the Lady Gildaguoat
Gave birth to a new heir. The Teuton tough
Murmured "Ach Himmel! Hope grim fate [mayn't
trouble 'em.
But Donnerwetter !—this renews the problem!"
It did, and in a complicated form;
For that same night, in the same Inn, was born
Another boy! A frightful thunderstorm
Broke o'er the town. The Nurses, who had torn
The infants from their cradles snug and warm,
Hid in a cellar I On the following morn
They sallied forth, cheeks pale and wild eyes fixed.
For in their fright the babies had got mixed!
"An old Btook incident," the reader ories.
Why, yes; but a romance is like a salad,
Not in the ingredients the skilled art lies,
But in the mixing. Novel, Play, Bab-Ballad
Of this most commonplace of mysteries
Have made their use; I felt that I a oall had
To show how Genius handled it. I'm twitted
With (Here two hundred stanzas are omitted!
True, they are full of fine mixed lore; they hop
Prom Cleopatra's cheek to Zoboasteb,

But Genius, though of many things a master,
Seems ignorant of one thing—where to stop.
For one small edifice of lath and plaster
Ten miles of scaffolding sense should not ask,
So here the scissors ply their needful task.)
But to resume. Fitzdotterel's fated heir
And an old German Socialist's last son,
Both born in the same hour, a storm, a soare!—
Sure, here's material for mystery, fun,
And high romanoe I Well, all shall have their share
As well I hope to prove ere I have done,

THE TOURIST IN TOWN.
THE MYSTERIOUS PENINSULA IN THE ST. JAMES'S PARK.
The History of its Patt. — From my childhood I had watched
the spot with awe. In maturer years I had heard that it was the
home of all sorts of wild animals—the head-quarters of the English
Acclimatisation Society. A friend of mine had told me (he was a
Member of the Council, or something) that the presents to the dis-
tinguished Association to which he had the honour to belong had
languished down anddown until,atlast, the wholeof the "exhibits" in
the gardens consisted of three Storks and an Elk. It was at this
crisis that new blood, so to speak, was poured into the body by the
Rajah of Bongorpoor (I cannot vouch for the exact name) suddenly
presenting the Institution with a full-grown man-eating tiger. It
was at this point that my friend (he was a dashing Major of Yeo-
maDry Cavalry) thought it expedient to resign. So I lost the thread
of the peninsular story. I knew not what became of the Accli-
matisation Society, or the Rajah of Bongorpoor, or last, but not least,
of the full-grown man-eating tiger.
Geography of the Place.—It waa surrounded by water, save where
a narrow isthmus of lawn joined it to the mainland. I tried to enter
the gates. They were locked and padlocked. I could see in the
distance a pretty cottage oovered with the most luxuriant creepers,
bat this dwelling was in its turn protected by rails and chained gates.
Evidently there was no approaching it by land. Then I looked round
and saw bow well it was defended. On the south was the Horse
Guards, with its two quaint pieces of ordnance and garrison of Cavalry
and Foot. On the west, in support, I noticed Wellington Barracks.
As I passed that Home of the Soldier I had seen a gallant band of
Volunteer Commanders going through a mimic battle, with the assist-
ance of about two dozen and a half of Second Coldstream Guardsmen.
I had also watched a very energetic Captain of the Reserve of
Officers doing absolutely marvels in the shape of company drill with
the aid of two sergeants, four privates, three drummers, and a pioneer.
"Were the peninsula in danger, the assistance of this powerful force of
"military " could be secured at a moment's notice. It was hopeless
to attempt to force an entrance from the land; so I abandoned the
idea with a heart full of bitterness 1
The Chimney and its Uses.—Then I tried to discover the character
of the plaoe from afar off. The shrubbery was so thick that I could
see nothing—save a high factory chimney! To what did that chimney
belong? I had seen a similar chimney at the Woking Cemetery,
and the chimney there was attached to a Crematorium I Was the
chimney in the Peninsula in the St. James's Park used for a similar
purpose? I thought of the full-sized man-eating tiger, and wondered
if any park-keepers had been sacrificed. The remains of the tiger's
meals could not be buried without infringing a statute dealing with
London Churchyards, so perhaps the Crematorium had been utilised
to'cheat of his fees that useful functionary, the Coroner.
Traces of the Acclimatised Animals.—Leaving the terribly sug-
gestive chimney for the moment, 1 carefully examined the lawn iu
frontof the peninsula. Tomyrelief Ifound that the Storkshadescaped.
There were three of them looking very white and scared, but still
alive. They seemed to have had 6ome terrible experience that had
turned their feathers from coal to snow in a single night. And it
appeared to me (it might have been only the effect of my heated
imagination) that they oould if they wished " a tale unfold " of the
fate of the luckless Elk. What had become of that animal? Had
it fallen a victim to the man-eater?
On the Trace of the Tiger.—I seated myself on a benoh beside a
little boy who was reading a book. Feeling rather like Mr. Henry
Irving in the Dream of Etigene Aram, I asked him a question.
"Have you heard,"—I said, pleasantly, for I wished to conciliate
the lad,—" have you heard that that enclosure contains a tiger?"
He got up in terror, looked at me with horror, and fled. No doubt
he questioned my sanity, and imagined I was ripe for a padded room in
the " Sanatorium " at Virginia Water, and the business-like bounty
of the late Professor Hollowat, of happy Pill and Ointment memory.
I could not tell him I was merely an explorer attempting to clear up
a very painful mystery.
An Expedition on the Lake.—I determined upon reaching the
peninsula by water. I noticed a deserted boat-house absolutely
covered with heavy foliage. In a few minutes I was paddling a canoe
and moving to the south. Some vigorous strokes, and, leaving the
many 'Atirys and 'Arrtets disporting themselves on the water
behind me, I prepared to shoot the Suspension Bridge. As usual,
that scientifto structure was lined with schoolboys ready to scoff
and pelt those who passed beneath it. I set my teeth, ducked my
head,—and was clear! A few pebbles fell plashing into the lake
near me as I passed, but soon I was within measurable distance of
the land of my search. Again I vigorously propelled my frail craft
until, with a scrunch, it was brought to a sudden stop by an obstruc-
tion in the water. The peninsula teas protected by a chain!
Possible Solution of the Mystery.—As I was leaving it suddenly
occurred to me that this plaoe might be " preserved" for the Royal
Ranger's shooting. Every Park has its Royal Ranger, and no doubt
St. James's is no exception. Who was the Royal Ranger who would
exuit in " big game." Immediately I called to mind a most Exalted
Personage who would be as destructive as a torpedo at a dozen yards
with a pistol. Why should not this Exalted Personage have used
the peninsula for dangerous Bport? Armed with an air-gun and
dressed in chain-armour, suoh a person would have been irresistible.
I put to myself a couple of questions, having the same answer, which
answer, it will be seen, pointed directly to a solution of the mystery.
1. Who was the bravest of the brave, a General in the British
Army, and one ever ready to do a deed of daring?
2. Who was the only man in England likely to engage a tiger in
combat single-handed?
Those were the Questions, and the Answer (as everyone will have
guessed)—H.R.H. Prince Christian of Sohleswig-Holstein! Could
it be that the most picturesque part of the Gardens dedicated to St.
James was closed to the Public to afford a veteran son of Her
Majesty a happy hunting-ground? Or to fall from the Sublime to
the Ridiculous, the Poetical to the Probable, was the Mysterious
Peninsula "railed off," to give pleasant quarters to a meritorious
park-keeper?
Bhyme by a Radical Anti-Woman's Rightist.
Give Spinsters a Vote? How the Tories will smile!
A Miss—we are told—is as good as a mile;
But at least, as a focus of Tory intrigue,
A Miss is as good as a (Primrose) League!

Luscioutness!"
So said my Cicerone, sleekly smirking.
"Is it not heavenly P" I replied, "Oh—yes!
But what is that strange Bmell in all things lur« in ;?"
",Pooh! fancy," he retorted. "Pray remark
How healthy people look. What airs, what attitudes!
You 're here as safe as Noah in his Ark.
Hygeia is not' in it' with these latitudes.
There is not any ailment you can start,
Or any misery you choose to mention,—
Too little money, too much gooseberry tart,—
But here may find its cure, if not preventii n.
Ili-re no one needs be poor unless he wills,
And no one needs be sick unless he wishes;
"We have the mastery of all human ills.
Born of short commons or of dainty dishes."
I said, "It must be an amazing place,
A land all men should seek with prompt velocity,
If from its precincts you contrive to ohase
The ghouls Ill-Health and Impecuniosity!"
But, over all there hung a smell of paste.
Which struck me as a sort of nasal riddle;
And something whispered me—in diction chaste—
"It'sail a diddle!"
There everybody rushed a4 vou with cash.
If it should hap that you'liad need to b( rrjw,
And if involved by speculation rash;
In any species of financial sorrow,
You only had to wave a postage-stamp
As signal of distress, as an old party,
May wave the bulky and 'Bus-hailing Gamp,
And philanthropic folk, with zeal most hearty,
Bushed to your rescue in a perfect crowd.
And placed unbounded wealth at your disposal.
"Ah! here," my Guide exclaimed—his voice was low'—
"Men are all friends who upon earth are foes all,,
Here Communism of the truest kind,
The confidence of man in man as brother,
(Upon his simple note of hand) you'll find,
Which shows how muoh they must love one anotb<r 1"
Yet over all there hung that smell of paste
Which struck me as a sort of nasal riddle';
And still that whisper oame—in diction chaste—
"It 'sail a diddle 1"
There every Drama was a " huge suoocss,"
A "mighty masterpiece " was each new Novel";
The which to laud critics in crowds would press,
And hyperbolically gush and grovel.
The Actors all were startlers, and the Actresses
A galaxy of Venuses, whose duty
Was well fulfilled, as public benefactresses,
By free display of genius and bare beauty.

O'er which the Public nightly would rejoice,
And penmen mom by morn raise a great rumpus.

Garments absurdly cheap and ever-durable;
There you could make a fortune at a blow;

A WHOLESOME CORRECTIVE.
"Love me, love my dog," is an injunction very difficult
to obey when the master happens to be a selfish "man," and
the dog a dangerous " servant." Constable J win Nic uolsok.
who had his leg bitten in two places by a savage bull-
terrier, belonging to an Ivy-lane publican, naturally
expected sympathy, and even compensation from the dog's
owner. He got, instead, heartless derision. It is too often
the case that the possessors of dogs consider themselves
entitled to allow them to become a public nuisance and
danger, and even rudely, and sometimes violently, resent
the mildest remonstrance on the part of the ugly-
tempered " pet's" victims. This mischievous and inso
lent assumption demands summary and severe disproof.
In this particular case Mr. Punch is pleased to see Sir
William Charley did his share towards such disproof
by calling on the bumptious owner of the biting brute to
pay the certainly not excessive damages of twenty-five
pounds. In street parlance, this probably made the jocular
Bung to " laugh on the other side of his mouth." It is to
be hoped this will prove a warning to the chuckling
churls who too often consider it " first-rate fun" to see
their ferocious pets annoy or injure other people. Dogs
who delight to bark and bite may perhaps be excused on
the old ground that " it is their nature to." But that plea
cannot be admitted in extenuation of the offence of their
sometimes at least equally brutal owners.
To what Bass Uses 1
Six Arte ur Bass is said to consider that the best thing
for the country is a weak Conservative Government.
Another authority has assured us that "to be weak is to
be miserable." A state of things in whioh the Conser-
vative Cats on the Treasury Benches should be continually
occupied in pulling chestnuts for the Liberal Monkevs
in Opposition, may seem a sort of ideal Utopia to Sir
Arthur Bass. To Mr. Punch, and other patriots
not party-ridden into intellectual and moral palsy,
it must appear a very contemptible and mischievous
Fool's Paradise.

KEEPING ON THE SAFE SIDE.
"And so it's a Sore Throat ye'vb got, Madam? And have ye ever
HAD ONE BEFORE I" "Oh IE?, OFtBN!"
"And what did te do for ir, now?"
"Oh, sometimes one tbino, and sometimes another."
"And did te get bid of it that way?" "Oh yes I"
"Then I'd just advise te to do what te 'vb always done, and maybe
YE 'LL GET BID OF IT AGAIN!"
A SINGULAR SHOT.
A Reminiscence of the First of September.
"I don't hanker much after gunning, but still I '11 go out on the First,
If you '11 warrant the weapon I carry shan't go off alone, and not burst.
A sixteen-bore gun, or a twelve, do you say? What on earth do you mean?
As the former sounds bigger than twelve, why, my lad, you shall give me sixteen."
So he spoke, in the cheer fullest style; and I thought, "He can't shoot, but no
odds:"
But I wasn't prepared for the dangerous way that he showed me his wads!
I hate your cantankerous man, who goes for a day's sport and quarrels;
But, hang it, all day, Sir, I seemed to be looking down loth of his barrels I
Of the highest repute as a friend, he was hardly a champion shot,
For he always contrived to discharge his gun where the partridge was not:
It is due to that sportsman to say, for himself he had no craven fears,
Bnt I can't state I cared for the manner his shot whistled close to our ears.
It doesn't increase your respeot for a man when you find that he shoots
Either just half an inoh from your nose-end, or else in the earth round your boots;
And his gun had a trick which is common among inexperienced men,
Of going off quite by itself in the friendliest way, now and then.
He made a good bag, though, you bet, though his shoot i n g was wayward and wild;
For he blew off the keeper's coat-tails and ne peppered a mother and child.
Two dogs and three beaters he slew, which was rather too bad, you '11 agree,
And he ended by sending an ounce of his chilled No. G into me I
That ended the day, for he seemed rather hurt at bis lingular luck,
And he helped me to pick out the shots from the part where his pellets had struck.
And next time I '11 go out by myself, as I've made my poor friend understand,
Though he is not a dangerous man whin he hasn't a gun in his hand!

must add that I have reason for belief that my shout of "Order!

I may label myself "A Silent Member." And I wished to be a
Silent Member, Mr._ Speak eh, — I mean, Sir,—until the time
arrived for eleotrifying the House by my great speech on the
Free Address Clause of the Parcels Post Amendment Bill. Sir,
just at the end of the session my opportunity arose, and I was
equal to it.
^,The Paroels Post Amendment Bill was fixed for a Tuesday—seven
days earlier I was down at the Constituency it is my pride and honour
to represent, the Borough of Waterspout-on-the-Brain. I sent for the

was impracticable, as the artiole (for which a trifle was expected)
was a perquisite of the Reporter."


Animation.
"Quite so, but this is a matter of far greater importance than
Reversible Tooth-brushes." And then I explained how I was on the
eve of making my great speech, and wanted it specially reported in
the Waterspout-on-the-Brain Impartial.
"Couldn't you give us a slip of it before, Sir P" asked the Editor.
"If you did, you might correct it yourself, and put in the 'laughters.'
We generally have a difficulty with the laughters '—we are rather
devoid of humour at the office, and never give satisfaction when we
undertake to find places for their proper insertion."
I agreed to send a copy of the coming oration, but that the speeoh
might have, so to speak, "looal colour, bargained that the Reporter
should visit Westminster, and on its delivery be present in the
Gallery. By special arrangement with a gentleman having the
entrie to the Press quarters, I had secured, for this occasion only,
the admission of a personal representative. Having settled these
preliminaries, I
set to work to
prepare my ora-
tion. I had al-
ready a vast
amount of mate-
rials—for years
I had read nothing that
had not assisted me
more or less in my task.
Now it was an appro-
priate sentence in a
leading artiole, now a
suggestive idea in a
business circular, now
a clever notion in a
railway time - table.

speech I found in the
utterances of Burke,

thoughtful harangue, although I am bound to say that when I tried
a portion of it on my wife, she seemed to consider it rather over the
heads of the common herd; at least, I imagine that must have been
her opinion, as she told me "it might be very clever, only to her it
seemed simply gibberish."
The eventful evening came. I was early in the House to secure a
good place. Abandoning my usual position on the extreme back
benches, I boldly left my hat on a coign of vantage. When I
returned from the library (where I had been
to make a last reference), with my arms full
of books and authorities, I created quite a
sensation. Even the Speaker (who was on
the point of vacating the chair) was startled,
and the Serjeant-at-Arms unconsciously
laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword.
I looked up anxiously to the Gallery, and
was relieved to find that my exertions had
been crowned with success, and that the
Representative of the Watertpout-on-the-
Brain Impartial was in his place, or rather
somebody else's. The Minister in charge of
the Bill performed his duty in a perfuno-
tory manner. At length the moment arrived
for me to move my amendment to the clause
whioh was to hand down my name to
posterity as the patriot who had gained to
the Parcels of the People absolutely free
addresses. My reception was complimen-
tary but not altogether gratifying. The
instant I rose to my feet there was a
stampede. No doubt it was generally
felt by the foes to my proposal that my
eloquence would be too much for them, and they fled that they
might not be convinced against their will. I had, so to speak, the
whole House to myself and the Reporters. I congratulated myself
on one fact—there was no one present to count me out. I think
I did myself justice. I spoke for three-quarters of an hour, now
almost weeping in my pathos, now my faoe wreathed with smiles as
I delivered the lighter part of my harangue. It was certainly a
wonderful performance, and when I left the House I felt that I had
done my duty and made my reputation. My speeoh, although
nominally addressed to my colleagues, was, through the medium of
the Press, to become the property of the entire English-speaking race
—it would travel to the four corners of the earth, and be as much
respected by the turbaned native potentate of Southern Asia as by the

Affectation.

EASTEND-ON-MUD-" EDITION DE LUXE."
This favourite (Thames) watering-place has recently been greatly
enlarged and improved. The Local Board (or some other august
body) have constructed an entranoe building to the pier, which, if
not exaotly " a thing of beauty," will very likely prove a joy for
ever." It is a most "imposing edifice," inasmuch as it looks like a
scientific institution, when in reality it appears to be a collection of
waiting-rooms. It is not very clear why this noble building was
ever erected. It seems too large for a residence for the pier penny-
takers, and can scarcely be utilised as stables for the two Mazeppa-
like Bteeds that belong to the tram-oar. However, there it is, and
(weather permitting) no doubt there it will remain. It is a most
agreeable addition to the sights of the place, being infinitely grander
than the town-pump.
But the more marked improvements are to be found in that part of
the pleasant place called Deepseaville. Here new houses have risen
by the dozen. Besides these a grand Yachting Club (which seems to
be all balconies and windows) has sprung up, as if by magic, out of
what appears to have been a neglected kitchen-garden. Beneath
this institution (which occupies high ground) is a magnificent marine
edition of Rotten Row or the Thames Embankment. Some public-
spirited person or persons has or have constructed a noble promenade
extending for a distance twice as long as the pier itself. This awe-
inspiring avenue is planted with trees and notice-boards. The latter
warn the passer-by of the fate that assuredly awaits him who dares
to tamper with the adjacent winkles.
Some two years ago, when this favourite (Thames) watering-place
was mentioned in these columns, certain Residents of Southend-on-
Sea who appeared to think their favourite (Thames) watering-place
was identical with Eastend-on-Mud, complained loudly of the attack
made upon their hearths and homes. Mr. Punch makes hats—he does
not fit them. But if Southend-on-Sea is at all like Eastend-on-Mud,
why then, in all sober seriousness, Southend-on-Sea must be a very
healthy, pleasant spot. The air at Eastend is simply delightful—
pure and fragrant as a rose in June or a native oyster in September.
The place is cheery and respectable. The grounds beside the Yachting
Club (which are open to the publio on payment of various perplexing
sums) might, perhaps, be better kept. With a fountain, a grotto, the
Guards' Band, and the Electric Light, the gardens would be twice as
attractive. Above all and before all, Eastend-on-Mud requires a
first-class hotel of the calibre of the Grand or Langham. Were such
an institution opened, it would not fail to be a great success. So
flourish, favourite (Thames) watering-place! May Eastend prosper,
in spite of the mud for which it has been famed, for centuries!
TENDER, IF TRUE.
The excitement aroused through the length and breadth of the
Spanish Peninsula by the reported annexation by Germany of the
Caroline Islands, has produced one obvious result. If it has not
caused Prince Bismahck to waver, it has certainly made him handle
this latest development of his Colonial polioy with a little more care
and consideration than he showed the late Government of this country
under not altogether dissimilar circumstances. The blind fury of
the insulted Spaniard, not to be appeased with reference to White
Books, or indeed to any books whatever, appears to have been a sort
of surprise to the German Chancellor; and, as the subjoined extract
from the close of a recent telegraphic correspondence will show, one
that has not been without its effect even on the constitution of the
Man of Blood and Iron:—
CONFIDENTIAL CORRESPONDENCE.
I.
Bismarck, Berlin, to Canovas del Castillo, Madrid.
Your last note to hand. Also extracts from Sohool Geography,
describing Protectorate of Carolines, and extracts from Frenoh radioal
frees, endorsing national braggadocio. Don't affect me in the least,
f you are up a Ministerial tree, that'» not my business. Afraid you
must manage to get down as best you can. Do we mean to stick to
the islands f Yes, we do.
n.
Canovas del Castillo, Madrid, to Bismarck, Berlin.
Your despatch, just received, has profoundly grieved and surprised
me. Think of the proud Spanish Nation, with the traditions of cen-
turies inspiring them, and reconsider favourably the evidence I have
adduced to you. Believe me, the spirit of Ferdinand and Isabella
is a factor with which I have to reckon. I have no choice but to put
the arsenals into defensive condition, and give instructions to the
Admiral on the Station. Spain expects it of me. I may be up a
tree, but I am a Spaniard, and I cannot get down. Be generous.
Be just. Obviate a catastrophe by at least a show of hesitation.
m.
Bismarck, Berlin, to Canovas del Castillo, Madrid.
Well, you are cool, at any rate. Spanish pride, indeed! Talk to
me of that when you have settled about Gibraltar. You've no case,
and no friends. Ergo, you must go to the wall. However, I've no
wish to force you there just at this present moment. Send in your
statement in full, giving dates. Perhaps we mayn't olaim, after all.
How would the judgment of a mutual friend suit you f Italy t Monaco F
Anybody? As to the " spirit of Ferdinand and Isabella," that is
bosh.
IV.
Canovas del Castillo, Madrid, to Bismarck, Berlin.
My Spanish heart goes out towards you in gratitude. That you
should not press your olaim is magnanimous. A mutual friend means
arbitration. This would be hazardous. Reflect. The proud Spanish
Nation confident of the justice of its claims, and deeply sensible of
the duty imposed upon it by a true regard for its nonour, would
hesitate to submit the question of its rights to the judgment of any
Power whatever. This is our Spanish way of dealing with events.
It is national, and I trust respectable.
v.
Bismarck, Berlin, to Canovas del Castillo, Madrid.
Fiddlestick! However, you shall have your way. We are not
going to blow you out of the water over a beggarly piece of busi-
ness like this. Make your mind easy, and remember me to the Uhlan

GOING TO THE DOGS.
Edith (Mrs. HiGGiNBoniAM, to Ellen, Mrs. Huggins, a few years
her junior, met on the pier of a fashionable watering-place). Oh, dear,
how do you do? I am so glad to have met you! How are all
friends? Have you seen the Doveys lately? How are Ada and her
husband getting on?
Ullen. very so-so, I am afraid. They quarrel dreadfully, I hear,
and am told he treats her no better than a dog.
Edith (sighing). Ah! No better? I only wish Valehtise would
treat me as well as he does his dog.
Ellen. What can you mean, dear? I always thought he treated
you with the fondest affection, and denied you nothing.
Edith. Oh, it isn't that he denies me anything except when he
disputes what I say. But he is fonder to his dog than he is to me—
a great deal.
Ellen. How so?
Edith. He not only allows his dog almost every indulgence, but
that without ever trying to convince the dog he would be better
without it. But as for me, if he thinks I should, he will persist in
trying to point that out. Here we are—he has gone up to Town
to-day—here, all because I wished it, and quite contrary to his own
inclination; but then he would argue that, for change of air and
scene, we might much better have gone to Roehampton, and that
we should go to the sea-side only to follow the fashion, from what
he called, I think, a gregarious impulse. He doesn't talk to his dog
like that, you know.
Ellen (laughing). Well, no, I should suppose not.
Edith. I mean he never talks to the dog in that tone.
Ellen. What, is he cross to you, then? Does he say unkind
things?
Edith. He is never what you would call cross. But he does say
things that I consider unkind. I call it unkind to try and convince
me against my will. I should like him, instead, to coax me as he
coaxes his dog. He pats it on the nose, and smooths it down the
back, and says, "Poor fellow I" and " Good dog!" and " Siket/!"
Ellen. Psyche—what, Psyche the name of his dog?
Edith. No, not P. S., but S. Siket/. He has named him after
Bill Siket, in Oliver Twist. It's a nasty Bull-dog, but very olever.
He makes it do all manner of things—go upstairs, and bring down
his slippers, stand on his hind-legs and beg, and perform thought-
reading.
Ellen. Thought-reading, dear I Why, how possibly P
Edith. Going and fetching something he nas hidden, without
letting him see. Oh yes I and a great many other tricks, because he
has made the dog mind him, and so he might me by going the same
way to. Then he lets the dog enjoy himself, eat and drink and
sleep, without ever troubling him about money and business matters,
so as to make him uneasy; and he never beats him.
Ellen. Why surely, dear, he never beats you?
Edith. No, not with his hands. But, as I told you, when there
are things I don't want to know, or to hear, he tries to beat them
into my head, and it hurts me so, I would as soon be beaten with
a stick—and I call that cruel.
Ellen. Well, well. He is bad enough, I daresay. But some men
are worse. My husband not only tries to argue me down, and that
when he is wrong, but he scolds, and sometimes even swears.
Edith. And what do you do P
Ellen. Never mind him. Let him go on until he has done. And
then I pull his whiskers, or poke him, or pinch his ear—in short,
treat htm like a dog—as you would like to be treated yourself. You
do the same. Then that will be doing as you would be done by—
won't it?
Edith (a little puzzled). Well, I suppose it will. But here comes
his boat, I think, and I shall be so glad to see him. of course; but
he has got that dog with him, which I wish he had left behind him,
or it had got drowned—the nasty, odious, horrid, ugly thing!
"We cannot Sing the Old Songs!"
It is said there is a project afoot for draining the Zuyder Zee. If
all Dutchmen had been water-drinkers, this matter would have been
accomplished years ago. Though the reclamation of so large a tract of
land will be an excellent thing for Holland, it will quite falsify the
sentiment of one of our finest old glees. The Mynheer Van Dunck
of the future will have to sing:—
"But a Dutchman's throat will always be
As dry as the well-drained Zuyder Zee I"
For when the Zuyder Zee ceases to roll, and is no longer deep, it
cannot possibly represent the magnitude of Mynheer's potations.

OUR SUMMER, 1885.
Street Sweeper Boy (from his point of view). "Another o' these Beastly Fine Dais 1"
WITH LOCAL COLOUR.
It is satisfactory to learn that the vivid description of the recent Imperial meeting at
Kremsier supplied by the indefatigable gentleman who represented the Times on the occa-
sion will not be lost, several of the now historic pictures furnished by his facile pen being
about to be transferred to canvas at the expressed wish of the august principals themselves.
Commissions have already been given to several local artists for the execution of the fol-
lowing subjects, and it is intended when the works are completed to present them to the
Museums of neighbouring frontier towns, where it is expected their presenoe will help to
strengthen and oement the friendly feeling of which the facts they are destined permanently
to chronicle have just given such a striking and evident guarantee:—
1. The Czab, on his arrival at the frontier town of Moravia, after trying on his last yearns
Austrian uniforms, and finding them all too tight, sends hurriedly for a local tailor, and is
measured for some new suits on the platform, amid respectful salutations.
2. The suites in attendance on the Russian and Austrian Imperial parties playing
"poker," and using the French language and " advantage" cuffs, in several saloon carriages
en route.
3. M. se OiEiis and Count Kalnokt
breaking their heads in a four-hours' con-
sultation over a despatch in cipher from
Prince Bismarck.
4. Secret meeting between the Czab and
Count Kalnokt, in which the former
requests that still further influence may be
brought to bear on the German Chancellor
to get him to telegraph to Kremsier his
receipt for "thinning himself down" as
soon as possible.
5. The Czab, after dinner, looking "as
if he had been made very happy by some-
thing that had occurred since the foregoing
meeting," and ordering his portrait, set in
brilliants, to be sent forthwith to Count
Taapfe, the Director of the Traffic Depart-
ment, and Cardinal Fubstesbebg.
6. The Czarewitch and the Crown
Prince of Austria crossing the market-
place of Kremsier, so closely followed by
the Times correspondent that they are over-
heard by him distinctly talking of the
state of the weather in indifferent French.
7. Departure of the Russian Imperial
Guests, and farewell at the Railway Sta-
tion, snowing the Czab and the Ehpebob
in the aot of embracing, and promising, in
idiomatio French, to take an early oppor-
tunity of seeing each other again, as the
former is about to retire to his private desk
upon which lie a few back numbers of
Lloyd's Weekly News, a Bradshaw for
June, and the Polish Punch.
• 8. The Emperor of Austria, after the
departure of the Imperial train, left stand-
ing with his tongue in his cheek, and ex-
pressing with a significant twinkle in his
eye, to the Governor of Moravia his satis-
faction that the affair "has gone off so
very satisfactorily to all the parties con-
cerned."

RIVER PUZZLE.
HOW TO GET INTO MOLESBY LOCK 1
THE LAST GROWLEB.
(After Thomas Campbell,—also after the Official
Report that there are one hundred and fifty-
seven fewer Four-wheeled Cabs in London
now than last year.)
Four million souls without a Fly 1
Shall we then realise
Oar lack of common comforts, born
From lack of enterprise?
I saw a vision in my sleep
That caused me from my bed to leap,
And skip around the room;
I saw the Final Growler go
Uohonoured, hideous, mean, and slow,
To its appointed doom 1
The gas-lamps had a sickly glare,
And not a heart did bleed
As passed that bony hulk along,
Drawn by its bony steed;
The Hansom-Cabmen winked and leered,
The very Crossing-Sweeper jeered,
The street-boys raised a yell:
And bliss o'er troubled spirits slid
To see that Four-wheeled Monster bid
To Fares a long farewell!
Yet, martyr-like, the Driver sat;
He knew the end was near
Of over-charge, and under-pay,
And did not shed a tear;
Saying,—" Too long I have delayed;
My Cab is old, my Horse decayed,
Tia Mercy bids me bolt;
For fifty years of mortal breath
We've jolted Passengers to death,
And shall no longer jolt.
"What though upon my seats have
writhed
The Great, perhaps the Good,
Condemned in this proud Capital
To use my box of wood t
Yet now repentance, all too late,
Makea me confess that ne'er did Fate
A vehiole provide,
More maddening in each palsied shake.
Or where long-suffering Fares might take
A more atrocious ride!
"'Tis done I Oblivion's curtain falls
Upon the myriad men
Who've Mown me up, and knocked me
down,
And ' had me up' again.
Those frowsy cushions bring not back
Nor stretch four souls upon the rack
By Nature made for twain!
Oh, let this cramped roof-tree go,
Also thv dirty straw below,
Thou'Vehicle of Pain!
"Even I am weary now of playing
My customary pranks;
Bank idiocy it was to place
Such Cabs upon the ranks!
How came it, else, that London's sons
To stable-owning Goths and Huns
For aid in vain did ory,
While every Gent, and every Cad,
In Aberdeen and Glasgow had
His reputable Fly?
"Go, Kings of Cabland, and reflect
On London's awful waste
By not a single Four-wheeled Cab
From Kew to Greenwich graoed I
Go, tell the world how you beheld
A .Tehu, bowed with shame and eld,
Guiding his Growler mean,—
The general universe defy;
T< match for sheer obliquity,
That ramshackle machine!"
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT IT?
A daily paper gives an account of a man
who furnished some information wilh regard
to the M ui in and his successor. In the
course of his story this person said :—
"Now, there are three men who have sworn to
resist to the death the dervishes taking Smith
Doogola; and these three are Sala AValad Fadlala
Salem Bey. the Kababeesh Sheikh, Khasem-el-
Noos, and Torabal."
What may be the real names of the two
last of these special correspondents we are
unable to say. But we are astonished to find
nur own Geokge Augustus disguised as the
Kababeesh Sheikh and squabbling with der
vishes, when we thought all this time he was
peacefully lecturing in Australia and writing
graphic letters for the Daily Telegraph.
"CHACUN A SON GOUT."
Speaking of the Hollurn Theatre, the
Daily News says:—
"ltomatic drama is, wo understand, to be the
staple product of the new management."
What is "romatio drama f" Not "rheu-
matic drama" it is to be hoped. There may
be a dearth of good dramatists, but we hardly
expect to see the drama on en itches just yet.

The more this metre one essays, the more _
One likes it. It flows on with such faoility;
The burthen of enoyelopsedio lore
It bears so lightly; fancy's fine fragility
Floats on its flood unfractured. What would bore
In simple prose, mere vapid versatility
Shambling prolixity, and shallow smartness,
Ideal humbug plus sham-cynio smartness;
Bald commonplace, bad grammar, cockney rhymes,
Awkward inversions, all go smoothly down;
Letters, advertisements, accounts of orimes,
Set in its fluent stanzas, take the Town.
Why, I could put a copy of the Timet
Into this metre I Gentle Muse, not frown!
Frown should come first, but there's the charm of rhyme.
Construction does not matter,—not a dime!
Back to my babies! Young Fitzdotterel
And Hermann Pumpernickel both grew up
The former was of course " a regular swell;"
But big, flat-faced, wide-knee'd as a bull pup
The stripling shaped; his voice was like a bell
A little cracked; to see him dine or sup
Might make Valhalla envious; he was waxen
Of epidermal hue; his hair was flaxen.
Young Hermann on the contrary—'twas odd
Ana bothered Edelweiss—was a girl's hero;

And murmur to himself, "dum spiro, spero,

Did he confirm my theories of heredity."

But when you catch a bit of bathos book it.
As sentiment profound and pure it passes,
Eked out by several " Oh's f" and some " Alases!"

We modish metremongers? They are like
Wings to the waddling tortoise. (Sereral sections

There 's no such Viceroy as your minor poet I
0 England! 0 my country! Sinks thy star
In the Midlothian morass for ever?

A poet-governor as bold as clever
Thrown over from a feeble fear of War!
Will the Eumenides forgive it? Never!
At least if it is possible to square 'em,
There's only one can do it—that's Lord Sarum.
Look at him in the House I Fitzdotterel did,
And vowed, compared with him, Jove was not in it.
Tall as a tower, broad as a pyramid,
He'd close Pandora's casket in a minute
By simply sitting plump upon the lid
Like—like—(trope is a tease when you begin it)—
Like a fat man on a tight-packed portmanteau.
With praise of Sabum I could cram a Canto!
He seems a oross 'twixt Timon and a Titan,
Scorning the petty world he proudly dominates;
A blend of a Colossus with a Crichton,
Cramped by the paltry herd his soul abominates,
And who hate him as minnows hate a Triton,
(Save those whom to high posts and perks he nominates)
A Gulliver by Lilliputians baffled,
A Pegasus by blind Boeotians snaffled!
Why here and thus lay adulation on
So thick and soft and slab, as with a trowel?
No Yankee lines my style is based upon,
The elegant restraint of James or Lowell
I do not ape. Sarum's a paragon,
Frankly, flamboyantly I make avowal!
And lay my homage at his haughty feet.
I hope his pride may find the offering sweet.

No more with Sarum he compared can be

LATEST INTELLIGENCE A LA MODE.
THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE.
Vienna, Sept. 9.
The disquieting rumours set on foot here by the recent article in
the Fremdenblatt have, to judge from the reply furnished in to-day's
Cologne Gazette, no foundation in fact. It is pointed out that so far
from any hostile attitude towards the English Cabinet having been
assumed at Kremsier, a distinctly complimentary message was dic-
tated by the Czar himself, and forwarded, in the very middle of the
State dinner, to Lord Salisru-rt. The precise nature of the terms of
this communication has not transpired, but it maybe safely hazarded
that it referred mainly to the character of the menu, which was con-
sidered excellent, and that it was skilfully interlarded with inquiries
as to his Lordship's appetite and health. The Cologne journal more-
over again asserts, what has been patent to all politicians here from
the first, namely, that the recent meeting was in reality organised and
carried out by the intrigues of several military tailors who have high
authority anil iniluenoe in Court circles at this capital. Similar
assurances are given from Berlin. Commenting on the situation, the
National Zeitung remarks that the interchange of military uniforms
may be regarded as the chief outcome of the meeting, and that the
fact that the Czar gave an extensive order for several hussar suits
on the Bpot, showed the genuine and spontaneous nature of the
proceedings.
8IE H. D. "WOLFF'S MISSION.
Constantinople, Sept. 8.
Affairs here continue to be much in the same condition. His
Majesty, who has now on several occasions seen the British Envoy, is
still loud in his praise, and on the last occasion but two rose and
shook hands with him. Meanwhile Sir H. D. Wolff is becom-
ing acquainted with the back Btaircases of several of the leading
Ministers, and has expressed himself as hopeful of being able, with
the aid of an efficient interpreter, to make the nature of his proposals
intelligible to Said Pasha. The slight bitch in the negotiations, to
which reference has already been made, still continues, but the belief
here, in well-informed circles, is that it will not neoessarily be
permanent.
Later.
No material change has occurred in the condition of affairs. Sir
H. D. Wolff has, to-day, however, been closeted with Assyh
Pasha for several hours, and has, it is understood, intimated that
he will oall again to-morrow.
Varna. Sept. 9.
Advices from Constantinople announce that Sir H. D. Wolff's
mission is for the present confined to a series of interviews with the
Dragoman of the British Embassy. There is no other news.
THE PHARMACEUTICAL CONGRESS.
Bruxelles, Sept. 6.
The sub-seotional meetings of the Congress were continued this
afternoon, and consistently with the spirit of far-reaohing and
enlarged philanthropy that has inspired their labours, resolutions
were unanimously adopted to the effeot that an international under-
standing should be arrived at not only for the guaranteed potability
of non-alcoholic beverages, and advertised mineral waters, but that
butchers' meat, vegetables, and bread and cheese should also be
included in the corpus of the new Universal Pharmacopoeia. The
qualifications needed, as a minimum of preparatory study, were
discussed at some length, and it was finally agreed that a know-
ledge of advanced trigonometry, oaliBthenics, not less than three
foreign languages, history, biography, zoology, and a full acquaint-
ance with all the applied sciences, should be regarded as necessary
to the taking the new degree of "Dootor of Pharmaoy." Perfect
unanimity prevailed, though gome ielat and liveliness was added to
the complimentary fetes held in the evening, owing to the expulsion
of the proprietor of a well-known English popular patent medicine,
who had attended the Congress apparently through a total misoon-
ception of its liberal aim and objeots.
THE CAROLINE ISL&NDS.
Berlin, Sept. 10.
The languid excitement over the seizure of the Islands shows no
signs of being stirred into activity, it being fully understood that
Prince Bismarck does not intend to force the hand of the Spanish
Government. It seems, too, the Chancellor is much incensed with the
Geographical Department for having misled him in the affair, and the
appearance of a new map of "Colonial Germany" will probably be
the result of the mistaken ambition that assigned the debatable
territory to its new hut unwilling masters.
The report that Canovas del Castillo has, at the command of
King Alphonso, forwarded the latter's Uhlan uniform to the
German Emperor, together with a dignified letter of remonstrance,
though looked on here as a probable canard, launched in the interests
of the Franco-Spanish Radical party, nevertheless gains oredence in
circles that should be well informed. If this should unfortunately
turn out to he the case, it will only add a further proof of the
deplorable want of faot and discretion that on all hands is admitted
to nave marked the oonduot of this affair from beginning to end.
Later.
War seems now certain, on acoount of the recent exoesses in
Madrid. The weather is very pleasant.
A "Burning Question," Indeed.
The criminal fools who carelessly throw unextinguished fusees
about, are perhaps even more mischievous than the criminal fools
who do the same with orange-peel. A shocking accident seems to
have oconrred to a lady at the inventions Exhibition owing to the
action of one of the former class of pestilent idiots. Anyone wilfully
dropping a lighted fusee or vesta without thought of the place or the
possible oonsequenoes, ought to be dealt with as a sort of minor
dynamitard—a public danger to be summarily punished wherever
caught.
"Miss Anderson mt Jo!"—
The talented American actress,
recently playing at the Lyceum,
last week appeared in As You Like
It, before several representatives
of the London Press, at Stratford-
upon-Avon. Seemingly the per-
formance was crude and, on the
whole, unsatisfactory. But what
enterprise on the part of the
London Press to send some of its
representatives! Going all that
way, and in some oases telegraph-
ing their notices to their offices!
How expensive it all must have
been to somebody!

THE "IMPROVEMENTS" OF THE TEMPLE.
How to Obtain Admission.—Select any day but the First of the
Month, and you will find the doors open. If you use a hansom, it
will be as well to avoid a nervous horse, as all the entrances are so
narrow and echoing (most of them are under dwarf archways) that
only animals with the sangfroid of a bathing-machine wheeler can
pass through them without agitation. On the First of the Month
you will find your ingress stayed by not-too-civil lodge-keepers
(by the way, the average Temple lodge-keeper combines with the
abruptness of the military drill-sergeant the superciliousness of the
Chancery Q.C.) posted behind looked gates or bolted doors. Your
best mode of obtaining admittance on these occasions is to take
chambers on the spot subsequent to beinjr called to the Bar. This
you will find a simpler process than convincing the custodians that
yon have a right to pass the portals over which they are mounting
guard.
First Impressions.—Having entered from the Thames Embank-
ment, you will immediately be struck by the rich fund of humour
evidently possessed by the Benchers, as sampled by their representa-
tives the Treasurers. For some years past the Inner and Middle
Temples have been undergoing what these worthies facetiously desig-
nate " improvement." The result is a gigantic architectural joke.
All sorts of styles are jumbled together in the most mirth-provoking
fashion—Gothic, Italian, and Tudor; stone, red brick, and stucco.
But the various "bits" are drawn together into one incongruous
whole by the golden rule of the Treasurers, "When you have built
anything particularly inappropriate to its surroundings, stick your
name upon it, and, if possible, your eoat-of-arms." Thus the glaring
new erections springing up aggressively in quiet courts mellowed with
age, or spectre-knight-haunted open spaces, look like signed articles
in a comic periodical.
The Gardens.—Of course inaccessible to the Public This is the
rule, but during the evenings of oertain of the summer weeks, the
grounds of the Inner Temple are " thrown open," (through a small
and inoonvenient gate) to the children of the neighbourhood, who,
once admitted, have the inestimable privilege of being allowed to
watch, from afar off, a number of rather portly juniors playing (not
exactly in "Renshaw form") an evidently extremely exhausting
game of lawn tennis. September being one of the pleasantest months
of the year for enjoying the open air, is naturally selected by the
Benchers for repainting the railings, varnishing all the Beats, and
cutting np the lawns and flower-beds recklessly in the agreeable and
apparently oongenial pursuit of drain-making.
King's Bench Walk.—Left to itself, the open space with its broad
spreading trees, old buildings and distant glimpse of the river would
be too delightful. So, to change all that" some mad wag of a
practical-jocular Treasurer has plaoed a couple of hideous lamp-posts
of different patterns in the very centre! For the sake of economy
no doubt (it is an open secret that the Inner Temple is too poor to
afford its Benchers a deoent dinner!) one of these horrible objects
(posts of course, not Benchers) combines the attributes of a water-tap
with the duties of an illuminator.
Pump Court.—Not to be confounded with the now classical regions
of Pump-Handle Court, wherein dwells the learned and industrious
Mr. Briefless, Junior. Pump Court is of the plainest brick, Pump-
Handle Court of the most quaintly carved stone. The former is the
quietest spot imaginable, the latter is the scene of a suicide or some
such horror about once a fortnight. Still, there is a tradition that
even Pump Court has had its tragedy. On the North side is a kind
of iron altar, surmounted by what appears to be a funereal urn.
This dreary monument was probably erected by a Treasurer to mark
the spot where a murder was committed years, perchance centuries,
ago. There is a legend above it, "Nothing whatever is to be thrown
on this sink or on any other part of this Court." The Benohers
must have their joke, even at the expense of good taste I Sink!

"DOLLY" CHURCHILL AT SHEFFIELD, LECTURING BEFORE A VERY SHARP AUDIENCE.
Fountain Court.—Here, perhaps, will he found in perfection the
"improver's" work. Only a little while ago there used to rise
beneath a canopy of trees a single jet of water, whose plash was
music to the ears of Dickens and Thackerat, and pleased Hundreds
and thousands of their readers. The Benchers could not leave the
little fountain alone. They had spoilt many a picturesque spot,
and many a memory-hallowed corner, so why should they not
destroy the prettiest sight within a mile of Bow Bells? So they
deliberately set to work to ruin the fountain. They built over the
pretty little jet of water a hideous affair of rock and stone, with
three melancholy storks standing back to back, and bowing down
their heads (very properly) in bitter shame. Having done this, and
set the jet, now converted into a squirt, a-playing, they enclosed the
whole in a square of about a dozen feet, composed of four beds of
invalid evergreens, and a stone path nine inohes broad. Feeling that
some lunatic (only a lunatic could want to make such a promenade)
might wish to walk in this dreary wilderness, they next closed the
four entrances with wire network to keep him out. But somehow
the squirt was a failure, and wouldn't play, and two of the storks
(no doubt out of compliment to the Benchers) lost their heads. Thus
more "improvement" was needed. So the last addition to the
hideous dripping pile is the most extraordinary "arrangement in
metal" that ever yet was seen. The Benchers have hammered on to the
top of the fountain, close to the mutilated storks, a "something"
that looks like a mixture of a very vulgar nob of a brass bed-post,
the nozzle of a fireman's hose, and the oross on the top of St. Paul's!
Finis.—After looking at " the fountain," you will have had enough
of the Benchers and all their "works!"
"Wild Spouts near ttie Horse- Gcahds.—Latest Particulars.

to have been left in the enolosure of St. James's Park, was kept for
the hunting of the Royal Ranger, whom he presumed to be H.R.H.
Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. Our Contributor was half
right in his supposition. There is a Royal Ranger of the St. James's
Park, and he does hunt. But the Duke of Cambridge, and not
Prince Christian, is the Ranger, and the sport is not driving from
their jungles the wildest of tigers, but chivying from their milk-stalls
a lot of poor old women!

KOBERT ON THE RIVER.
Great Marlow, in spite of its name, is ginrally considered to be
one of the littlest and qwietest plaoes on the hole River, but if any-
body who was a labeling under that deelushun had happend jest to
have run down there for to spend a appy day on Wensday the 19th
hinstent of Orgust, he wood have thort as the stout Gintleman says
in the Play, "Lawk, how this world is given to Lyingin 1" For on
that day we had our Regatter, witch rowed on, with jest one our for
needful refreshments, from about 12 in the morning to about 9 at
night. Well, here have I bin a spending more than a hole week
here, and didn't ewen know as I was a living in the sillybrated
County of the Dook of Bocktnham, witch I am told is as much supe-
rier to every other County as Buckinham Pallis is to every other
Pallis, and the natives of witch is acshally as prowd of being born
there as I am of being born in Lundon, and never should I have
known it but for the Regatter, but at the hend of hevery race the
Judge, for we had a reel Judge to pass sintence, made 'em write up
in big letters the countys of the winners, and in every one as I seed
it was "Bucks," and wen I said to Mr. Shaw, the boat bilder,
who's quite the King of the plaice, how proud them Bucks must be
at winnin bo many races, "Yes," he said, "they is, but they gine-
rally does it, for in coarse we Bucks is as much souperior to other
men as the Bucks of the Forest is to the other wild beasts there,"
witoh seemed reesonable enuff.
But wot most astonished me was the Judge, he was that partickler
that he coudn't hav been more so if it had bin ewen a case of Petty
larseny, or ewen wus than that. Why at the hend of every race—or
heats as they call 'em, cos the rowers was all so preshus hot, I epose—
he seemed to say to 'em, you did it so bad that I condems you to go
back to the plaice from whence you come, and do it all ower again. And
if they was pretty ot after the fust heat, wasn't they jolly ot arter
the second I Why the prusperation run down 'em like drippin. But
little they cared for that, for there, close to the winning post, was a
large table all covered over with sich a display of reel suver prizes as
woud have set up many a Pombroker's establishment. And they was
all giv away at the hend by a Lady, jest as if she'd have bin the Lady
Maress! The sports in the water was, I thort, jest a little bit
wulger, but the lower olasses as was present seemed to enjoy them,
and it's quite rite to consider them a bit, pore dewels!
The eloomenated percession of Boats was jest a leetle better than
the scene at the Inwentions, and wen it oum a rowing along in all its
glory, the egsited Mob, witoh by that time must have reached amost
a hunderd, acshally showted with rapshur. Two of the boats in the
races was that heavy that it took 8 men a peace to row 'em. A f rend
of mine at the " Hanglers Retreat," took me hover the Habby at
Dish'em, I think it is called, but it was all in sitoh a huproar coz the
Habbot was away that I coudn't see much of it. It's the old story_, I
spose, wen the Habbot's away there's some nice play. My frend tried
to git me out on the sealing of the Tower, but the way in witch I
see'd one pore gent handled to get him back agane through a remark-
erbly small winder, gave me warning at once, and I respeofully
declined. It doesn't quite do to sacrifice all won's dignerty and
character to meer hid al curiosity out of a werry small winder, however
brite the prospect may be of gitting safe back agin.
The pioturs was most remarkabel fine. Sum on 'em being about
as old and as hugly as them I seed last year at Ampton Court, witoh
is saying a good deal. One of the reel curiositys of the hold place is
an hornted Chamber, where a lady warks about at midnite, without
no hed, witch is her punishmeant for beating her little boy to deth
for blotting his Coppy book! It seems a rayther doutfool story at
fust, but the sollem look of the most respecfool female as told it at
wunce conwinced us both. It didn't seem to be treating the pore
hedle8s ghost quite farely to so cram the room with chairs that she's
sure to break either her legs or her arms the nex time she warks
there. Her nek I spose is quite safe. I don't think as I shood werry
much care myself about sleepin in that ere partickler chamber. I
think, on a pinch, I shood prefer the cosy looking Kitching. No
ghost was never known to harnt a Kitching, unless he were drest in
Blew, and the shrunk condition of the cold Jint prooved as he had
his hed on all rite.
Well, I 've left gentelmanly Marlow all right, and as a few others
has left two, if any boddy wants a weak or 2 of bootifool river seenerv,
with bootifool soft rows, and drives, and warks, and with sitch a gal-

(By a Country Farmer—New Style.)
My Dear "Wife,
I am very glad I did not bring yon up to this "awful big
place" (as the man calls it in the play), as you wished. You seo, my
angel, you could not be spared from home. How would the girls
have got on without you superintending their singing lessons, to say
nothing of it being bad form to be away on your day "? Then, as
I am a Conservative, and love old customs, I like to think of you
following the tradition of my Grandmother, and pretending (she was
in earnest, the quaint old soul!) to take an interest in the pigs. Ah!
how I do envy you your quiet country life!
Well, no doubt, you will want to know what I have been doing
while I have been here. Improving my mind, my dear girl,—
improving my mind. Would it cause you surprise if I were to tell
you that I had been to the Museum in Jermyn Street, the Diploma
Gallery at the Royal Academy, and the Crypt of St. Paul's Cathe-
dral? Yes, it would. And if it surprised you. my life, it would
surprise me even more. No, Tory as I am, I still must march with
the times, and so most of my days have been spent in selecting and
purchasing ./Esthetic furniture. The drawing-room at the Farm is
sadly Philistine. I have pioked up too some very nice Japanese
hangings for your boudoir.
And how have I spent my evenings? And now I know my move-
ments will meet with your approval. Instead of visiting the theatre
and the music-hall, I have, country-fashion, passed the night in the
open air. Certainly, I have seen the Great Pink Pearl at the
Prince's, a capital bit of fooling, and the Silver Shield at the Comedy,
a piece that deserved success if it did not obtain it; and once again
I have assisted at a splendid spectacle at Her Majesty's. But what
of that? Although for an hour or two I might have trifled with the
Drama, my heart has been true to Science and South Kensington.
I have already told you of the very interesting contents of the Inter-
national Inventions Exhibition. You will remember how I have
explained to you the various exhibits—with the assistance of the
Guide-Book.
But although the Inventions are interesting, I felt that I must not
neglect the "Second Division—Musio," and accordingly spent the

Advance of the British Army at South Kensington.
other evening in listening to the performance of the British Army
Quadrille. It certainly was very grand, although I must say that the
march of the Bands was rather impeded by the dense audienoe.
You would really be astonished at the number of people who use the
grounds at South Kensington—I do verily believe that the gardens
there are nearly as popular as the Galleries 1
As I had enjoyed a specimen of English Musio at South Kensington,
I thought it only fair to go to Battersea Park to test the quality of
the Foreigners. You must know there is a place called the Albert
Palace which (like the Royal Westminster Aquarium) has been
erected to commemorate the virtues of the late Prince Consort of
pious memory. I am told by a London friend, that all the places
associated with the glorious name of " Albkkt the Good," sooner or
later drift into weak copies of Cremorne. The Scientific Institution
in Battersea Park is highly respectable, no less a person than Alder-
man Sir Robbbt Cabden (who was, so I am told by the same London
friend, a dashing subaltern of infantry in his youth) being the Chair-
man. The gallant Alderman has got together an orchestra composed
entirely of lady artistes, from Vienna. It must have oaused Sir
Robert an enormous amount of trouble to have selected so clever and
comely a troupe. But the result is most pleasing, the more especially,
as the musicians are rather ornamental than useful. They play very
nicely, but a great deal of the hard work (such as blowing the wind

instruments, playing the biggest of the drums, &o.) is done in the
background by men hidden behind a screen of skirts. I fanoy this
quaint idea originated in the fertile brain of that very old Soldier
"dear SitRobebt," as I understand the veteran Alderman is called
by the light-hearted female stall-keepers at Battersea.
Finally, with a view to testing the amusements of our country, I
accepted an invitation to dine with friends at the Crystal Palace on a
Saturday, with Military Band and Illuminations " to follow." The

dinner was so particularly good that I dispensed with the second part
of the programme, and spent my time instead in smoking, "dessert"-
ing, and studying the menu. You know how bad our cook is—I
think when I return I shall be able to give her a few wrinkles. I feel
sure the Illuminations and Band must have been magnificent I

A LITTLE "DIFFERENCE j"
OB, A WOBD IK SEASON.
Mr. Keeper Punch loquitur:—
Not rivals, but comrades! Exceedingly well!
And each in his way is a capital shot.
A conple of runs whioh would certainly toll,
In a well-beaten stretoh or a corner that's hot.
'Tis not the first time you have tramped foot to foot,
Or popped gun to gun in a really " big shoot."
In style, just a little unlike to be sure,
With dissimilar tastes in the matter of dogs;
Both eager a pretty day's sport to secure;
One dashingly tramples, one sturdily jogs;
Each has proved that his own style of shooting will pay,
When you' ve counted the game at the close of the day.
Once more at the start of a Season, you find
Your foot on the stubble, your hand on the stock,
And you scarcely appear to be quite of a miod,
Say sharp rival shootists all eager to mock.
if it so, Oentlemen P Better cut short
Any squabble at onoe if you really mean Sport 1
Old hands at the job you 're aware of that same,
And a pretty long practice in shooting together
In every season, at all sorts of game,
And in every conceivable species of weather,
Must have taught you at least it is no time to quarrel,
When game's on the wing, and your hand on the barrel.
True, one may prefer just to stick to old ground,
And one have a fancy for breaking up new;
Most probably quarries in both may be found,
But wasting the day in discussion won't do.
Tou '11 get little more than your pains for your trouble
By fighting the point between turnips and stubble.
Yours is not the sole Party that's after this quarry,
Another one's watching you over the hill;
To join them won't pay, though they would not be sorry
Would one of you lend them his cool steady skill.
If you'd still shoot together don't wrangle or lag,
Or 'tis they, and not you, who will make the Big Bag!
THE PUBLIC AND THE "PUBLICS."
The Morning Advertieer, protesting against " ill-regulated inter-
ference" with our Publio-house system, says, "The tendency is to
make the Public-house what it originally was—a place for the
refreshment of man and beast." Quite so. Only it must be under-
stood that "man and beast" are two, and not one, as is now too
often the case, and that with the connivance, if not the encourage-
ment, of the Publican. "The nation," continues Brother Bung's
Oracle, "neither wants the greasy sloppiness of the Coffee Palace,
the illicit tendency of the Club, nor the glaring frivolity of Conti-
nental eafi life." Perhapa. But neither does it want the noisy
aottishness, the foul riot, nor the adulteration-bred phrenzy of the
ordinary—too ordinary—Gin Palace. These things, indeed, demand
not a little vigorous and summary " interference," and it is only
ill-regulated houses whioh would consider that interference "ill-
regulated."
Comment by a Cockney.
BiD-Gastein! Sounds more fit than nice, and yet
They say most healing waters there are had.
Strang*, though, that people fancy good to get
By going to the Bad!
UNSPORTSMANLIKE.

THE MODEL WIFE.
(Not after logo. By a Lonely Bachelor.)
WANTED.—A Spinster of any age she -will own to under thirty.
Must be an Orphan—if friendless all the better. No relatives
at all for choice, if any, none that she would want to know if I didn't
wish. Positive disinclination to dances and evening parties. Absolute
abhorrence of the society of any but rational and thinking people.
Detestation of all customary,and common amusements, such as cards
and backgammon. Appreciation of excellence in Art, Literature,
and Music, but executive ability, in any line, no consequence; except
cookery and practical needlework, domestic tailoring, and other
industries. Preference for economy in ostentation rather than in
oomfort, and particularly than in food and drink, and, rather the
latter. Refusal to comply with any fashion which is grotesque or
inconvenient. No fads such as induce many ladies to attend public
meetings, and subscribe to bosh. No interest in popular actors,
authors, or speakers, merely on account of their popularity ; no admi-
ration of any celebrities simply as such—no running after Lions, unless
incidentally at the Z.G. Disposed to bodily exercise—would usually
walk rather than ride. Passably good figure; face plain in the proper
sense of the word—not ugly, but no beauty to spoil. No care whatever
for anybody's admiration except mine.—Apply at the Matrimonial

"ENGLAND AS HE IS TREATED" IN GERMANY.
About a fortnight ago a party of English tourists, consisting of a
Major in the British Army, nis daughter, and two male friends, were
arrested in a Frankfort cafe, marched through a crowd, and finally
thrown into prison. There they were incarcerated for half a day,
and there no doubt they weuld have remained muoh longer, had not
a chance meeting with a London solicitor led to their restoration to
liberty. The only charge against them was that one of their number
bore some supposed resemblance to the photograph of a man more
than twenty years his senior. As nothing seemingly has been done
to compensate these outraged travellers, it will be as well to publish,
for the benefit of intending tourists, the German answers, translated
into English, that the foreign police are likely to give in response to
remonstrances made on similar future occasions. It may be called—
Replies for a Trip of Pleasure.
Yes, although you have not finished your cutlet, you must come
along with us.
Quite so. Though you have your arms pinioned, your daughter is
merely handcuffed.
No; you will not be told why you are treated thus, beyond being
informed that a man who wears a red tie might be guilty of any
kindred atrocity.
Certainly it is true that your two male friends are lying in the
deepest dungeons beneath the castle's moat.
Yes, your Aunt will certainly be tortured unless she confesses.
You are not far wrong in supposing that the man you say is your
brother will be sentenced to penal servitude for life.
It is against the rules to furnish you with pens, ink, and paper,
even to enable you to write a letter to the Times.
You cannot be put in a cell by yourself. Yes; the felon chained
near you is accused of murder.
You may say or do what yon please, but, mark us—you will get no
redress!

SONG AT SCARBOROUGH
During the Match Gentlemen of England v. Players of
England, September 3, 1885.
Ye Gentlemen of England,
Who smite for twos and threes,
One bat has swiped for twenty yean,
That bat is W. G.'s.
That wondrous willow wares again
To match the old, old foe,
And spanks through their ranks
Whilst the bowlers puff and blow,
Though Tom Emmktt Bends them swift and straight,
And the " field" do all they know.
Britannia need not tremble
Whilst he his " block" can keep,
And slog for sixes and for fours,
Though the field stand close or deep.
There's " powder " yet in every stroke,!
His " drives " like lightning go,
And men roar as the score
Swells at every swashing blow,
Though Ulyett " sends 'em down.".likeIhail,1
And Feate his best doth show.
The Cricket fame of England
Shall yet in brightness burn,
And we can wait without blue funk
That Cornstalk Team's return,
Whilst W. G. can show such form
After twenty years or so;
The fame of his name
Sounds wherever Britons go,
And the mighty score on Scarborough's shore
Should bring him " one cheer mo!"
"Bitter."—It is announced that Sir William Har-
coubt will visit Derby on Ootober 17, to take part in the
unveiling of the statue of the late Mr. Bass. Some of its
subscribers, with a view to improve the inauguration of
that memorial, are said to meditate a request for the
attendance of Sir Wilfrid Lawson.
OUR NOTES AND QUERIES.
Seasonably arranged in "Queen's " English.
Suggestion Wanted.—Having rented a small country honse for
the present month, I am about to give a ball, to which three hundred
people have been invited, but the only available room I have for
dancing is a roofless and weather-beaten barn sadly out of repair,
that requires flooring. What can I do in the way of decoration to give
it, at a small expense, the appearance of a light and elegant apartment
suitable for the purpose. Annette.
Travelling In quirt.—We are seven in family, three of us being
invalids who cannot move comfortably or safely anywhere without
Bath chairs. What would be the simplest and most direct way of
getting to Bordigherra, either by the Rhine and the Swiss Lakes, or
by any other equally familiar route? Would it be possible to get the
chairs over the Simplon, or, failing that and being obliged to part
with them on this side, could we secure a fair price for them r or
would it be better to have them sent round by Marseilles and Nice to
meet us in the Maritime Alps, relying in the meantime on offers of
looal assistance '< Any correspondent who has had the experience
and will communicate fully will oblige Hystericus.
Present for Baby.—Perhaps "God-Papa" wishes to offend the
baby's relations, otherwise the damaged ophioleide case can scarcely
be regarded as an agreeable or appropriate gift on the occasion. He
had better revert to his original purpose, and work it something him-
self in crewels. Unless " God-Papa " contemplates at the last moment
purchasing something for the baby, in which event I should suggest
a complete plated gold and silver dessert service as likely to give
general surprise and satisfaction. Wild Robin.
Etiquette.—" Angelina" is wrong in supposing that a declara-
tion of affection should necessarily be made by a gentleman on one
bended knee. _ Such, we believe, is the custom in the highest oiroles,
and still obtains at Court, but it is not now considered ae rigueur in
general society. With reference to her second question,—decidedly,
To. Goloshes cannot be worn in the drawing-room under any plea
whatever. The fact that the gentleman offending doubted the
honesty of the domestic left in charge of the hats, does not affect the
question. Euterpe.
Ink-Stains.—The only method of removing the ink-stains from
your blue satin boudoir furniture will be to rip off all the material,
and wash it in hot tea and salts of lemon; but as this will cause the
stuff to shrink, you must be fully prepared to find that it will be
impossible to re-cover with it the surface it formerly occupied. Under
these circumstances, your best plan would be either to entirely ink
your whole suite till it match, or, better still, order new frameworks
of a smaller size for your sofa, chairs, and other occasional pieces.
This is perhaps the simplest plan, though you must not be disap-
pointed at finding your satin, even when replaced, a dull yellow-
green colour, and anything but attractive to the eye. It is extremely
difficult to remove ink-stains from blue satin. Fanchette.
Exchange.—"Penelope" wishes to change one dozen jars of
pickled cucumber and a white cockatoo, affable with children and
very talkative and amusing, for jewellery of equal value, or novelties
in needlework, wood-engraving, drawing-room ornaments, old point-
lace, or Aylesbury ducks.
Down, Dairy, Down!
The milk of human kindness must be curdled
When from the post it held for many a day,
That broad Park walk tree-shadowed, iron-hurdled,
Milk Fair remorselessly is driven away.
Needful P Those new park plans may have their merit,
But—well, Punch envies not the task of TYRWHrrr.
Look Out 1
The following alarming information is given in the papers:—
"It is rumoured that both Covent Garden and Her Majesty's Theatres
will cease to exist next year. One is to be thrown into the area of Covent
Garden Market, and the other is coveted by the postal authorities.'
The postal authorities are quite welcome to covet anything they
please, but we must earnestly protest against any theatre being
thrown into the area of Covent Garden Market. This neighbourhood
has long been disagreeable: it now promises to become

"HOOP-LA!"
In consequence of the possibility of Bioyoles being used for scout-
ing purposes in warfare, the following set of questions has already
been drawn up by the Military Authorities, for use at the next Sand-
hurst Examination:—
1. What course would you be inolined to recommend for practical
adoption if, when the enemy's cavalry is charging down on you, you
find yourself suddenly and violently precipitated over the handle of
your machine owing to the front wheel coming off P
2. State your method of tightening your cranks under a hot fire.
3. Do you consider yourself qualified to guide a machine with a
revolver in one hand and a sword in the other P Mention how, under
inch circumstances, you propose making praotioal use of your field-
glass P
4. What's your way of treating an enemy that shouts "Yah I
your back-wheel's going round 1"
5. On arriving at the summit of a steep hill, and finding the enemy
in full possession of the ditch half-way down, what sort of patent
brake would you prefer to have attached to your bicyole P Which
would be best—to shoot the hill, or shoot the enemy P
6. At what preoise moment in the decisive Battle of Coventry
did the British Commander flash the thrilling signal (by heliograph)
to all parts of the field—" England expects every man to oil his
machine " P
7. Supposing that fifty howling savages are hanging on to your
i, and jobbing you with spears, would you feel a glow of
at remembering that an economical Government had failed
to supply your machine with one of the Patent Galvanic Death-
Dealing Backbones?
8. Do you think the new Torpedo Trioyole likely to be most peri-
lous to the enemy or to its rider?
9. In riding through a dangerous country, where there's every
reason to fear ambushes, which do you think the safest seat on a
"Tandem "—in front or behind P Which would you offer to your
Commander-in-Chief if he requested a mount P
10. In those numerous oases where good macadamised roads would
require to be made through dense jungle and over perpendicular
mountains before cycling scouts could begin to operate, what par-
ticular advantage do you think would result from their employment
in preference to a few light mounted skirmishers on horseback?
At the Top of the (Willow) Tree.
Oh, Yorkshire and Lancashire both are big pots,,

FITZDOTTEREL; OR, T'OTHER AND WHICH P
{By the Earl of L-tt-n.)
"Supposing I was you,
Supposing you was me,
And supposing we both was somebody else,
I wonder who we should be."
Canto III.—Love and Lucre.
"A German Fraulein, young, and fair, and fond,
With ochre hair and eyes of China-blue,
Yearns inexpressibly to correspond,
At once, with some young Teuton, with a view
To Matrimony. Wealth hath she beyond
The dreams of avarice, quite enough for two.
An early interview could be arranged.
N.B.—If wished, Photos might be exchanged."
"By Cupid, Pumpernickel, here 's your chancel"
Cried Beevor, reading the above advertisement.
"I see an opening here for Trae Romance.
Nay, do not soowl, I tell you nothing pert is meant
By my remark. I see, Pomp, at a glance,
That by this notice, naive though slightly curt, is meant
Beauty phenomenal, a spirit olear,
And something like ten thousand pounds a year."
"Bosh!" grunted Pumpernickel, bendiog over
The Ramayana. "I must quite refuse
To play the part of advertising lover.
Or help support the Matrimonial News.
Can you not see this hackneyed rot must cover
A ooarse and cockney soul?" "No, in your shoes,"
Replied Fitzdotterel, " 1 should answer her, man 1
Ah me! I only wish / were a German!"
"Why, so you are," said Hermann, with a sneer,
"By our agreement." "Ah! of course," cried Beevob,
"I never thought of that." "Your course is olear,"
Pursued the Teuton. "If you 're a believer
In such stale clap-trap, if you do not fear
1 Playing up' to this scullion-souled deceiver,
And want to get into a pretty pickle,
Answer, and sign yourself H. Pumpernickel."
Mighty is Instinct, mightier still is Doom!
(This has no meaning, but it sounds like Omen.)
That little joke in Pumpernickel's room,
That friendly frolic interchange of nomen,
Auroral gladness or Cimmerian gloom
Was pregnant with. Fitzdotterel worshipped women,
His soul was simple, sympathetic, saintly,
His sense of humour glimmered rather faintly.
All hail, Absurdity! Without thine aid
Dulness would rule the world in hall and hovel.
Where without thee were Satire's pleasant trade '(
Did not humanity in thy bathos grovel,
There were no lure in Love for man or maid,
No stuff for the third volume of a novel.
No writer, then, can contemplate with levity
Dual Control of Common-Sense and Brevity.
That Condominium, though, is still remote.
Fitzdotterel, spite of Pumpernickel's mockery,
Felt that this German Girl he madly loved;
His soul was rather Rousseauish than Cookery.
Sentiment callow-brained and oheveril-gloved
Leads to much breaking, both of hearts and orockery.
Beevor—as Pumpernickel—therefore wrote
The following seductive little note.
(He penned it in a wood, at the dictation
Of an old elm. Pray, don't suppose I joke.
Trees are " fair oautions" at confabulation;
Don't you remember Tennyson's " Talking Oak "?
Fitzdotterel always went for inspiration
Into the Forest, penning what it spoke
Unto his heart. His book. Whines from the Wood,
The Morning Pump considered very good.)
"H. P., a Teuton twenty-two and wealthy, ■ ■•■ -
Has seen Lone Qrstcukh's sweet Advertisement,
And straightway through his soul List's footsteps stealthy
Stole conquertngly. He will be well content ......
To marry her; hut, just to prove her licalthy
Scorn for the huckster charms of cent.-per-cent,,
He wishes hir, hefora he corresponds,
To invest one-half hex wealth in Turkish Bondt." ...-'^ ■ flu,
Love at first sight's stale stuff for the Romancer,
Love per Advertisement is far more fresh.
Why should it not as excellently answer
Twin souls space-sundered Bwiftly to enmesh?
Hermann, whose temper was as orabbed as Cancer,
Said Love must make appearance in the flesh
Ere o'er him he would exercise his spell.
But 'twas not so with young Fitzdotterel.
His love cared naught for flesh or photos. No!
An Astral Body, vouched by Mr. Sinnett.
Would have sufficed his yearnings. (Here a flow
Of Mystic Lore sets in. We HI not begin it.
It runs through seven hundred lines or so.)
Fitzdottekel pined for Gretchen's love. To win it
He was prepared all measures to exhaust,
To dote like David or to sin like Faust.
But Beevor, rushing forth to post his note,
His heart a-thump, his pulses in a nutter,
Butted against Here Edelweiss, and smote
The poor old pedant plump-into the gutter.
0 Destidv! how you must grin and gloat
To see bow Man, for all his fume and splutter,
Is but thy Shuttlecock! There is a game
By ladies loved, Badminton is its name,
Which is a truer type of human life
Than—{Scissors through six pages .') EDELWEIf 8
Soon wormed out Beevor's seoret. Like a knife
Cut his keen scorn. "Ach Himmel! this is nice!"
He shouted. "A Fitzdotterel seek a wife,
Like some erotio shop-boy 1" In a trice
Beevor peroeived that he had played the noodle,
And fawned on Edelweiss like a spanked poodle.
"Fitzdotterel, Keep your Pecker up! Though] humbled,"
Said Edelweiss, "respeot your family motto.
Give me the letter." Poor Fitzdotterel fumbled
In all his pockets. Where could it have got to?
Alas I when in the gutter those two tumbled,
(0 Fate, thou 'rt stern as Germany's iron Otto !)
The note had dropped. The sequel Fancy painted.
Fitzdotterel flopped upon the floor, and fainted.
A sort of Operatic Rigmarole
Is Life 1 (Here Pegasus is off again.
But, though his pace is pretty on the whole,
The flying steed requires a tightish rein,
And we shall never reach our distant goal
If thus he keeps " cavorting round,"—that's plain.
Snip! There go Ptolemy Eu'ergetes,
Euclid, the Vedas, and the Dukes of Guise !)
That letter went! Some good Samaritan
Had from the pavement picked and posted it.
Edelweiss, dear Polonius-like old man,
Learned, but owlish as to mother-wit,
Could hit upon no more sagacious plan,
Than to advise the tangled twain to flit.
"One folly drives another out sometimes,
So what say you to trying foreign climbs t"
One pun—an old one—makes the whole world kin.
'lis us heart-opening as rum-punch or platitude.
Oh {Scissors.') Beevor " twigged" with a broad grin.
"Hoch !" cried he, striking an heroio attitude,
"Let 'a join the Alpine Club, and strive to win
Penny-a-liner fame and Gossip gratitude,
By scaling some tall peak's untrodden snow,
Like that Excelsior fellow, don't you know 1"
They started, Beevor as Herr Pumpernickel,
Hermann as Lord Fitzdotterel, whilst that letter
Flew on to cheat Lone Gretchen. Here's a pickle!
Could Collins or Gaboriau mix a better ?.
It promises Bhet r smash. But Fortune's fickle,
Roses entwine Fatality's iron fetter;
And when things seem in the most hopeless dead-lock,
Romanoe strikes out a road to joy and wedlock!

CAROLINES AND PENNY-A-LINERS.
The news received from Berlin that King Alphonso had written a
short and pressing letter to the German Emperor has naturally
excited public opinion as to its contents, and though the Times says
that " nothing has transpired as to its tenour," and adds " that it is
affirmed that the Emperor has communicated it to the Empress and
the Prince Imperial, and that all three are very much impressed by
it," the following may be regarded as the authentio text of the
spirited document in question. Events move fast, and its interest
even now is somewhat on the wane; yet, as a factor in the present
complication, it is, no less than the prompt reply it elicited, and
which is subjoined below, not without its weight.
Madrid, September 14, 1885.
Deab Royal and Impebial Cousin and Uncle,
What on earth is to be done? Since my last the regrettable
incident, to whioh I will not further refer, has, of course, accentuated
the situation, and I fear, whether I will or not, I shall be forced now
to assume an attitude that will fill me with lively regret. It is
ecaroely possible, in the face of the manifestation of popular feeling
here, to escape the necessity of telegraphing to the authorities to
make some demonstration on the spot. You see how I am placed.
Could I not rely on your goodness to order your own vessel to keep
well out of the way, if only for a few days? This would seem such
a fortunate and desirable solution of the difficulty, which, believe
me, at least here, is most acute and pressing. / am writing this in my
Uhlan uniform, that I have put on, not with a view to appearing in
it in the balcony before the populace, but as a compliment to you,
through your Ambassador, whom I am about to receive in audience.
You see, therefore, that whatever obstacles beset me, I am still and
always shall be, Your devoted and anxious Cousin and Nephew,
Alphonso.
Bf.blin, September 16, 1885.
Deab Royal little Brother and Nephew,
1 am profoundly touohed by your appeal, and you may
assuredly count on my most excellent good will. Explain your
wishes fully to Solms. Though our worthy Chancellor had not so
purposed it, our vessel will not trouble your ships, but proceed to
Singapore. Never mind the regrettable incident. Diplomacy will
smooth away the excrescences of the situation, and meanwhile keep
up your Spanish peoker, and trust loyally to your old and devoted
'"ather and Cousin, William.

LETTER TO ASHMEAD BARTLETT, ESQ.
(Car* of the Right Hon. Mr. Punch.)
Mt Dear Dame Babtlett,—You ought to be more careful now
you have asked yourself into office. You have been, so far, but a
note of interrogation; promote yourself to a full stop now. An I
for an Eye has scriptural warrant, but the maxim may be abused.
These remarks, my dear Dime, are due to a report of a speech
which you made somewhere the other day. This is a hit of what you
said:—
* No language was strong enough to condemn the politician who under-
rated the need for England of a paramount Navy. He [Bye, that is] would
pass over the Imperial value of our maritime power—the glory, prestige,
honour, those priceless attributes of a great and self-respecting nation. The
sickly and pusillanimous cosmopolitanism and the flabby and fantastic senti-
mentalism of our day despieed these noble heritages of an illustrious past,
and laboured to supersede them by the cult of every worthless barbarism and
every antagonistic interest, and by their universal and new-fangled Panjan-
drum, ruinous scuttle, and shame."
I never myself heard of any politician who underrated
My dear Eye, I thought we were
Now
the need of a paramount Navy,
all agreed about it. But your English, Bajbtlett—your English!
I would charitably hope that you had taken too much of your nosts'
wine. But you had not. For if you had, you could not possibly
have made such a sentence as " the sickly and pusillanimous cos-
mopolitanism and the flabby and fantastic sentimentalism " clear to
any human being, let alone a reporter. Try it when a little sprung.
Then, dear Dame, what do you think you mean by "a universal and
new-fangled Panjandrum? What is a Pan j and rum P A prescrip-
tion P a jorum P Unless you were haunted with vague ideas of your-
self in the character of a little round button at top, I am unable to
arrive at the remotest conclusion as to what you thought you meant.
A common Panjandrum is said to be a kind of Javanese Common-
Counoilmau. A universal and new-fangled Panjandrum becomes an
unutterable nightmare. A "ruinous scuttle" is also a vile phrase,
especially when suddenly wound up with such a common-place
expression (so unworthy of you, Babtlett) as "shame." Coals are
dear, but scuttles are much as they have been since Oscar improved
them. Think of your parents! Mr. and Mrs. Babtlett, Senior,
will be summoned and fined by the School Board of Eye for not
enforcing your attendance, if you go on like this.
We will part on friendly terms this time, dear Dame, but do take
care. Have you ever read the Ingoldtby Legend* T Hardly, I
should think. But consider this stanza with a variation:—
Lord Salisbury, Randolph, and eaoh Tory man
May say what they please, and may do what they can;
But one thing seems remarkably clear—
They may go out to-morrow, or stay in next year,
Make his borough a " distriot." or anything try,
They '11 never get quit of the Member for Eye I
Warningly yours, Strattojt Strawless.
A HATEFUL HABIT.
Colonel Sir Francis Bolton, giving evidence at the inquest held
on the poor lady who died from the effect of burns received at the
Inventions Exhibition, deposed that it was a very common practice
to throw lighted matches on the ground at the Exhibition, and that
he had been looking out for an acoident of this kind for some months.
Inspector Rowland stated that on the same night he counted twenty
persons who perpetrated this act of oallous imbecility. Twenty pos-
sible homicides, and—alas 1—one aetual one, and all from that
unpardonable " want of thought" whioh is almost as bad. and some-
times quite) as mischievous, as "want of heart." The Coroner and
the Jury agreed that the mischievous habit must he "put down";
and Mr. Punch hopes that the oruel death of this poor victim of selfish
folly may at least have the effect of hastening on that"
mation most devoutly to be wished."

A Figure Head.
A SHORT HOLIDAY CRUISE.
(her old Ground—On Board—The Mystic Umbrella—The Composer
in a New Character—Arrival— Under Weigh.
Once more going North from Euston, with my friend, Cullins the
Composer, whose oharming song " The Past is but a Muddled Dream,"
recently created such a/urore in musical circles, both bound for the
Yacht Aramintha. We go by the Limited Mail, and find an un-
to take possession of our seats. She has had,
however, to argue with a sturdy Scotch
Guard, and is now confronted and put
utterly to rout by the lawful owners. She
disappears, and is heard no more. It is
late in the season for a cruise, and we fear
the weather is breaking. We hope for the
best, and are more or less prepared for the
worst. Uneventful journey. At Carlisle,
hunger being a sharp thorn, we try a cup of
luke-warm and doubtful coffte and attempt
a nibble at a shoe of bread-and-butter, to
which the description of some fine ancient
vintage would apply — " curious, old, and
very dry." It is nine minutes past 5 a.m.,
and. the Guard did not inform us that, as we
were bound for Stranraer, we had at least a
quarter of an hour to spare, instead of being
hurried off in five minutes. Why has he kept this a secret? There
might have been something better at Carlisle, after all, than the above-
mentioned fossil bread-and-butter, tepid coffee, and indifferent tea,
which last considerably upset the Composer's equanimity. How-
ever, he justified his professional claims by composing himself to
sleep; and repose, not conversation, being our object, we were more
or less somnolent, and perfeotly silent.
N.B.—North Britain. Sunrise very effective. I draw the Composer's
attention to it, thinking he would like to compose something about a
Sunrise,—say a Sunata,—but he only turns round and burrows into
the cushion, muttering "Sunrise be blowed!" The Composer is
evidently a trifle crusty. To adapt Dr. Watts'b Sluggard, "I
have called him too soon, I shan't call him again." Wepass the
"Irving Arms Hotel." Evidently a theatrical district. Wonder if
there's an " Irving Legs Hotel" r Nobody visible; only geese and
donkeys out at this time of the morning. This observation would
not be a safe one to make in the presence of a man gifted with what
in Shakspearian times was styled a pretty wit." He would be sure
to use it against you. In his present sociable frame of mind, I fancy
the Composer would if I gave him a chance.
Dumfries.—The Composer murmurs, as he gazes wearily through
the window at nothing in particular, " I'm I Castle of Dumfries.
Let me see—what happened there? Siege—I think—subjeot for
cantata—or opera." Then he dives down again head-foremost, and
disappears under a rug.
At Lochmaben, or some suoh name, whioh sounds to the initiated
as if not totally unconnected with the mysteries of Freemasonry,
we don't stop, but only considerably slacken speed, and the train
passes as it were on tiptoe, so as not to disturb the sleeping inhabitants.
Perhaps there's a special signal up " Please don't wake the Station
Master." If not, it is remarkably thoughtful of the driver, and let
us include the stoker, who may have suggested this idea to the driver.
Stranraer.—We both regard one another dubiously. The sea is,
there is no concealing the fact, the sea is just a little less calm than
we could have wished. The Composer, pulling himself together,
announces his intention of taking breakfast on board the steamer
whioh is to convey us to Lame, in Ireland. I follow suit, with
qualms.
We embark. We breakfast. I am bound to admit, an excellent
breakfast, as this meal, in Scotland, universally is. Also cheap. It
is ready for you immediately you come on board, and you sit down to
it before the boat starts. Verbum sap. After it, I he down in the
saloon, being unwilling to trust myself on deck, a proceeding which
would result in my arriving at the Yacht a mere wreck, a pale phan-
tom of my usual self. But I know that the evil hour must come.
I have a presentiment. So I stay below. The Composer exoitedly
hurries down, to inform me that the Captain has got a powerful
magnetio umbrella which will much interest me. It attracts the
compass. Let it; it won't attract me; and I remain where I am.
J'ysuiSfj'yreste. When the steamer stops at Lame, however, CULLINS,
who is as brisk as if he had never done anything all his life but skip
up and down a companion, insists upon my seeing the Captain go
through his performance with the compass and the umbrella. [Cullins
acting as snowman, having taken the Captain entirely under his
patronage, as I will now explain.]
In the Captain's existence this episode of the magnetic umbrella
marks an epoch. He is just now full of it. I believe that till
Cv i.i.i nk came on board he has been in the habit of delivering a series
of seriously scientific lectures to detachments of passengers, con-
sisting of as many as can at one time find standing-room in the little
deck steerage-house, to whom he has at considerable length enlarged,
on the divergences of the compass as affected by a magnetised
umbrella; and in this instructive exhibition he has generally been
assisted by any amenable passenger who would carry the umbrella
and obey the Captain's directions. But with the appearance of
Collins all this is changed. Cullins, in spite of his being an emi-
nent composer, has a hard, sharp, and undeniable manner with him,
which takes a stranger by surprise, and compels him, on the first
impulse, to render blind obedience to the Composer's dictates.
Physically, the Captain of the steamboat would make three of
Cullers, but the latter holds him with his glittering eye, and has
much the same effect on the Captain, as the magnetised umbrella
has upon the compass.
The Captain is talking to a friend, and is on the point of quitting
the ship. But Cullins won't'allow anything of the sort.
"Here, Captain! Hi! hi!" he ories. "Come back! Here's
the gentleman to see the umbrella." And hack comes the burly Sea
Captain, with a rolling gait, like one of his own steamers in a ground
swell, and submissively produces the umbrella, inviting me to follow
him into the steerage-house.
"Ye '11 just mark the compass," he commences, very slowly, being
evidently deeply impressed by the immense importance of this scien-
tific phenomenon, when Culllnb outs in—
"The Captain means," says Cullins, briskly interrupting, and
acting as a lively showman and also interpreter, as though the Captain
had been addressing me in some strange foreign language,— The
Captain means to say that he wants you to see the effect which that
umbrella—its frame is made of magnetised steel—has upon the
compass."
The Captain, who has not yet recovered his breath, he has been so
completely staggered by the words being taken out of his mouth,
nods his head in token of assent, and is evidently beginning to ask
himself whether he is in a dream, and if he is still commanding on
board his own ship or not. But Collins, whose tone and action
have drawn a certain number of idlers from the landing-stage, and
caused some of the departing passengers to pause, having now got
together something like a respectable audience, with me as a sort of
chairman, to whom he can personally address his remarks, continues
in his sprightliest style—
"You see," he says, addressing me, in my aforesaid imaginary
capaoity, in the first instance, and then taking his audience into his
confidence right and left, "one night the Captain looked in here,
and found the oompass was indicating the wrong course "Here
he turns to the Captain for corroboration, and obtains it, the Captain
bending his head slowly forward like a mechanical wax figure. From
his puzzled expression I can see that Cullins is not putting the
case with nautical precision as concerns details, but that, on the
whole, the narration is correct, and the Captain, listening to his own
story sb if he were hearing it still in a dream, cannot recover himself
sufficiently to wake up, and tell it properly himself.
"And,_ continues Cullins, looking round at his auditors, who,
from their attitude of respectful attention, I fanoy now begin to
think that he is either the Managing Direotor of the Company, or
the sole proprietor of the steamers on the Stranraer and Larne route,
"when the Captain notioed this, he took charge of the steering him-
self. The compass still varied, turning this way and that way "—
here, following the dramatio movement of Collins's hands, the audi-
ence listen with breathless interest,—" the Captain, as a thoroughly
experienced sailor,"—here they all regard the Captain with admira-
tion, and he himself looks modestly down, as though he were having
his health proposed by Cullins, and were meditating what on earth
he should say in reply,—" knew that there muBt be some counteracting
influence. But no one was here with him, no one was, as far as he
could see in the dark night, outside. But, not satisfied, he looked
out again, and then he saw an elderly Gentleman." The Captain
nods, and intimateB that Cullins is now on the right tack.
I, in my temporary character of Chairman of a Scientific Associa-
tion listening to instruction, give a dignified bow of enoouragemtnt
to the lecturer, the audience draw breath and won't lose a word of it.
Cullins proceeds:—" The Captain asked him to step in. Directly
he did so, the compass went right round at him." Audience takes
this literally, and show signs of alarm. They think Cullins and the
Captain are Spiritualists. "The Captain said, 'Sir, you have some-
thing about you which interferes with the true aotion of the compass.'
The middle-aged Stranger indignantly denied it. The Captain re-
quested that he would allow himself to be searched." Great excite-
ment among audience. All eyes on the Captain. Captain a bit
bewildered, evidently doesn't quite recognise himself in this part of
the narrative. Cullins goes on as if he were addressing a jury:
"The gentleman resented this. The Captain insisted. He
pointed out that he couldn't allow his ship to be run out of her course,
and all their lives endangered because the elderly passenger had a
bit of steel in his pocket, or whatever it might be that so powerfully
affected the oompass. Well, he was searched thoroughly, and
nothing was found."

Breathless interest. Everyone, myself included, expecting that
the stranger would turn out to be a sort of human electric-eel, a
very attractive, and yet a shocking sort of person.
The Captain having partially recovered the use of his voice, is heard
to murmur something, but Cttllins won't have it, and means to go
on as he has begun :—
"In order to be searched he had to take off his coat, and to do that
he deposited his umbrella outside. The search being over, he went
out at the left door, but this time the compass didn't follow him, but
pointed right. Out went the Captain,"—ihis sounds like the song
and chorus of " Down went the Captain, down went the Crew," and
I fancy from a note in the Composer's voice, that a reminiscence of
this is in his harmonious and retentive mind; it is at all events an
opportunity for a chorus which everyone present has allowed to
escape,—"Oat went the Captain, and there was an umbrella,"
Immense sensation. Startling dramatic situation. 1 Is this yours?'
he called out to the passenger. It was. 'Then, look here,' said the
Captain, 'this umbrella has been magnetised, and you might have
wrecked us all with it." Audienoe thrilled with horror. Cullins
points to the Captain, and says:—
"Captain, have the goodness to produce the umbrella,and show us
how it acts upon the compass."
The Captain, as passively obedient as the mesmerised lady who
carries out to the letter the conjuror's orders, at once complies He
doesn't say anything, but he moves the umbrella first to the Tight,
then to the left, and we all crowd round the compass watching its
extraordinary revolutions. Everyone exclaims, "Well, that
curious!" and generally regard Cullins and the Captain with
lurking suspicion that they are confederates in a swindle, and that
there will be something to pay for the show.
"Now, Captain," says Cruras, authoritatively, "take the
umbrella outside."
The Captain obevs. He takes it outside, and looks at us_ with a
curious sadness through the window. The compass persistently
follows the movements of the Captain with the umbrella.
"There's dearly no trick about it," observes one of the audience,
in an undertone, to a friend, who replies, "Oh, no; it's quite
genuine." Then the little crowd breaks up and melts away gradu-
ally, as they do from the front of a Punch and Judy Show when the
man is preparing to go round with the hat, while I hear murmurs of
"Oh, very curious! most interesting!" as they disappear one bj
one, and two by two, in a surreptitious, shuffling sort of way, as if
they were conscious of having encouraged a thowman under false
pretences, and were now sneaking off without paying for the enter-
tainment.
I am left standing by the compass.
"It is most remarkable," I sagely observe, and I don't know
whether to congratulate the Captain on the acquisition of the old
umbrella, or to condole with him on the loss of his brand-new
one, whioh, he informs me, he has given to the mysterious and
dangerous passenger in exchange for the magnetio instrument. It
is a second-hand kind of article, and, as a protection against rain, is,
I s«e, utterly useless. Certainly the Mysterious Traveller got the
best of the bargain.
A voice from the quay here sings out, " Hi! you fellows!" and, in
another seoond, Collins has caught the tone, forgotten all about the
Captain and his umbrella, ana, exclaiming to mo, "Hi! here!
Come along! here's Mkllbville," he has hurried over the gangway,
and is shaking hands heartily with our host and old friend Melle-
ville, owner of the Amarintha. I wish the Captain " Good-bye!"
and join our friends on the pier of Lame Harbour.
"Blowing a bit fresh," observes Melleville. "Bat I suppose
you'd like to get under weigh at once P"
Certainly, if that suits him. It does. And so, directly we are on
board the Amarintha—and to reach her we have a somewhat uneasy
experience in the gig, rowed by four of the stalwart crew—we shall
start for—where?
"Well, we shall make for Oban, but we shan't get there to-day,"
says Mellevllle; "though," he adds, "it ought to be a very good
sailing-day."
Cullins the Composer, no longer the Showman, Lecturer, and the
despotio Commander, seems, so to speak, to have retired within him-
self, and to be disinclined to come out again.
Once more, traps and all, on board the Amarintha. The Ama-
rintha evidently wants to get away; she is very restless, and is
jumping about as fresh as a horse that has been three days shut up
in the stable.
Up she goes! Down she goes! Sideways she goes to the left 1
Sideways she goes to the right! Up she goes I Down she goes!
"Now, what would you both like to do!" asks Melleville,
cheerily.
Cullins and myself,—I see the reply in his eye, and I feel it is in
mine,—would say, if we might speak out honestly, "Please, 8ir,—
we'd like to go back again." But we are here for a holiday cruise,
and so I answer, boldly,—
"Well—I think—I'll-in fact, I think I'd better"—(Up she
goes! and down she goes! and sideways she goes! and roll she goes!)
—" I think I'd better go below, and—lie down,—eh P Don't you't"
"Certainly," returns Melleville; "far the best way,—and get
it over!"
Cr/LLIN8 has already vanished. I descend the companion. Up
she goes again! Whop she goes! Yeo ho! One, two, three, pull!
Bound she goes! Side way b she gce9! Can't
unpack. Down she goes! Where's berth P
Sideways she goes! Berth meets me half-
way. Whop she goes I Over she goes!
Flop she goes! Down she goes!
And down I go, flat on my baok—and
they don't see me again till dinner-time.

A SONG FOR SKEGNESS.
"It ia just the place for a few hours at the sea-aide, the Paradise of
the 'Cheap-tripper,' with wide-spreading sands, whereupon children can
disport themselves with perfeot safety."—Standard.
Do you like the North Wind with the roar of the seas,
Am the spray flies afar on the boisterous breeze;
Do you caro for a pier that is terribly long.
With a room at the end for the dance and the song;
Do you sigh for a place where there's no need to dress
In fine clothes, then away to the shores of Skegness.
Are you fond of cheap trips, when our'Abet's about,
And bis rather cacophonous laughter rings out;
Do you go to the sea-side to rollick and joke,
And to ride up and down on a poor little "moke ;"
If you care for a swing, if you dare to oonfess
To a love for Aunt Sally, then go to Skegness.
If you oare by the far-sounding ocean to stand,
And to watch little children build forts on the sand;
If you wish to be photographed there by the sea,
With a pipe in your mouth, as if out on the Bpree;
Why, go to the Lincolnshire sea-coast, and bless
Your stars that you thought of a day at Skegness.
If you like a plain tea, here are folks "on the job,"
Who will do it forninepence, with shrimps for a " bob."
Hot water costs twopenoe, no great store of pelf.
While the wily excursionist brings grog himself.
There's a whale too on view—it were long to express
AB the wonderful things you can see at Skegness.
Are you fond of a neighbourhood perfectly flat,
With never a hiU that's as high as your hat;
Do you oare for a place where, you must understand,
There is nought to be seen but the sea and the sand,
With an atmosphere bracing; you '11 paok up, I guess,
And go off for a trip to that breezy Skegness.
Seasonable Munificence P
A Dignitary of the Established Church, in a pastoral on Funeral
Reform, recommends the performance of obsequies with decent
economy, and suggests that such saving of expense might be devoted
in some part to a charitable or useful object. Exoellent advioe: but
little, perhaps, likely to be followed by survivors who feel them-
selves heavily enough burdened with Probate and Suooession Duty.

A DAUGHTER OF EVE.
Mamma. "Well, Eva, what abb you looking in the Glass for? Skartkninq yourself up! eh!"
Eva. "Oh dear no! / don't want to look Younger than I really am!"
THE POLITICAL POLO MATCH.
"Ho! give the Hobby-Horse more room to play in 1,"
Cries the old singer of " The Morrioe Dance.
The Hobby Game, as played our modern day in,
Lacks not for scope. See how they spur and prance,
The rival Champions at the old-new sport,
Loved now as in the days of Harry's Court!
Modes Bhift, but motives change not. Fast and furious
Waxes the fray as in old tilting lints.
Lay on! lay on! Can such hot zeal be spurious P
After the ball! What eager turns and twists!
What is the sphere that makes suoh toil and trouble P
Is it more firm than Folly's flying bubble P
Who, in mid-chase, asks what the quarry's worth;
Hot on the trail and fierce in emulation P
Polo pour rire may move the Sage to mirth,
But a pea-bladder-bout's an occupation
As serious as exchange of thunder-blasts
In red and real Battle—whilst it lasts I
Thwack! Thwack! This way and that way flies the ball,
As each bold rider deals his mighty "smite."
Whioh one shall make a goal, which fail or fall P
Are solemn questions shrouded in sheer night.
Who can help musing, though, 'midst all the pother,
How like the Champions are to one another P
Did they change Hobby-Horses—fearsome thought
To their excited backers, howling yonder !—
Had they perchance under changed colours fought,
What would have been the difference, we wonder?
Would they have fought with less tremendous dash,
Or would the world have come to utter smash P
But eaoh his mount has chosen, for the time,
And each seems bent on winning this one match;
Each to outpace the other burns. Sublime,
When in the Hobby-Tourney Patoh meets Patoh'l
Yet some may feel, by furious feints unshaken,
Such tights may be too seriously taken!
A PHILISTINE ON THE PRIMROSE.
Is there any suoh Primrose as a September Primrose P Lord Ten-
nyson, according to an admirer of the noble Laureate, has answered
the question in some lines in his In Memoriam, representing
"The primrose of the later year
At not unlike to that of Spring."
The Tennysonian, touching this testimony of Tennyson's, justly
remarks that: "If he says that there is such a primrose, we may
rely upon it that he is right." No doubt; but does Tennyson say
that there are any autumnal primroses other in their kind than
autumnal apple-blossoms, abnormal and uncommon P Everybody
knows that primroses in September are nothing like so plentiful as
blackberries, and that there is no proportion whatever between the
Michaelmas Primrose and the Michaelmas Daisy.
Is it quite impossible that the " primrose " of In Memoriam may
have been a slip of the pen, and that, by the flower so written down,
the Poet in his own mind really meant the croons, that is to say the
Autumn Crocus, identical to the eye with the Spring Crocus—the
meadow-saffron {Colchicum autumnale), so oelebrated as a cure for
gout and rheumatism P Dryasdust.
Mem. by M'Calvity.
"Balder—the Hope of Spring—is nothing but a symbolisation of reviving
Nature."— Time$' Critieitm on Mr. C. W. Lloyd1! " Song of Balder," pro-
duced at the Hereford Festival.
Reviving Nature P Hope of Spring? That's pleasant!
But quite a piece of humbug, I should say.
Were it but true, 1 were rejuvenescent,
For I—alas I—am Balder every day 1

SHOOTING DISTRICTS.
(By Dumb-Crambo Junior.)

Bread all Bun.
THE TOURIST IN TOWN.
The "Fleet" on the Thahes.
Hoto to get on Board.—By paying a small charge, rising from
one penny up to four shillings and sixpence. The Money-takers, as
a role, are either extremely melancholy or ultra-savage. The former
generally sell in a plaintive sort of fashion cheap oigars and super-
fluous hat-guards, the latter show a disposition to question your
right to a ticket by vacating their boxes when a steamboat hails in
Bight. Having purohased your voucher, you get on to the pier,
whioh is usually undergoing certain mysterious repairs. Some or the
landing-stages are bright with flowers and substantially built, but
others (notably that of Vauxhall Bridge) are gloomy and shaky.
A man who sits upon one of the benches at the pier just indicated is
worthy either of the Victoria Cross for bravery, or apartments at
Hanwell, Colney Hatch, or Holloway's In-Sanatorium at Virginia
Water for dangerous lunacy. The usual fashion of conducting em-
barking and disembarking, as adopted by the "Servants of the
Company," is to allow the boat to approach the floating barge
within measurable distance, to make an abortive demonstration with
a rope, and ultimately to huddle the passengers over a watery chasm
with a long jump ana the cry, "Now then, look sharp, if you are
going I" Pier-masters of a jocular turn of mind, however, prefer the
Eeat "Crushtoe Act," which consists in bringing the end of the
Ider sharply and unexpectedly down upon the feet of people wait-
ing to come ashore olose to the gangway.
Impressions on Board.—That the River certainly might be cleaner,
—you have your doubts whether it could be dirtier. If you happen
to have travelled in other steamers, you will be surprised that
Londoners can put up with suoh miserable accommodation.
If you take up your place in the bows, you will probably be half
poisoned by rank tobacco; if you keep in the stern, you will certainly
be sprinkled with " blacks " from the funnel. In either position you
will have to sit upon a hard bench fashioned after a very primitive
pattern. Should the rain compel you to take shelter in the "cabin,"
you will enter a small, badly-lighted, wretohedly-ventilated apart-
ment, whioh in the course of a few minutes will, from excess of so-
journers, become intolerable. At the entrance to some of the cabins
you will find "Refreshment" counters (faintly reminding you of street
apple-stalis) furnished with sweetstuff, buns, bottled ale, and other
luscious luxuries. Returning to the deok, you will notioe that the
funnel at high tide is a thing not to be disregarded, especially if you
happen to be seated underneath it when the boat is shooting a bridge.
If you escape the funnel, it will be as well to look out for the atten-
tions of the gamins who line the summits of the Westminster and
Waterloo arches, because those attentions are more boisterous than
pleasant. To sum up, if it is fine, yon will get covered with soot; and
should it rain, you will have the choice of either being drenched on
deck or stifled in the cabin. Under these circumstances, it is not
astonishing that the Shareholders of some of these steamboats have
not been greatly troubled about receiving an embarrassingly heavy
dividend.
Pleasure Trips.—There are several. If you are fond of running
aground near Twickenham you can take a ticket for Hampton Court,
when you will have the privilege of travelling by a vessel specially
built for the voyage, whioh moves at the rate of at least two knots
an hour. If you are more ambitious, have learned to love " Southend-
on-Sea," ana have not Sootoh views about the First Day of the week,
you can embark on board a " saloon steamer" on a Sunday, and
travel down to that pleasant watering-place. Such an excursion will
reveal to you that the golden rule of the vast majority of the
passengers is " When in doubt drink a bottle of beer," and that the
vast majority of the passengers consequently and seemingly spend
their entire time in a condition of chronic perplexity. You will also
note that a "saloon steamer" is considered incomplete unless it
possesses a band of aged musicians, who look like sailors who have
been instructed in the elements of music by self-taught Mermaids,
very late in life. You will also observe that a large per-centage of the
excursionists seemingly have recovered at some time or another from
a smart attack of small-pox, and a yet larger per-centage are addicted
to the fine old English occupation known as "drowning it in the
bowl." If you have no objection to beer, music, suggested con-
valescence, and horseplay, you will find a water excursion to Southend-
on-Sea altogether oharming, but if you are not particularly fond of
such "incidentals" why—why-you had better go by some other
route.
Besides the above-mentioned diversions, there are, occasionally,
"moonlight trips," which are conducted with a certain, or rather
uncertain, consumption of stimulants. Farther a-field—at one of
the Kentish watering-places—this idea was adopted by the owner of a
private steamboat, who was (and perhaps is) in the habit of carrying
out of the looal jurisdiction of licensing Magistrates a cargo of baccha-
nalians bent upon drinking spirits during land-prohibitive hours.
It is reported that the captain of this mirth-provoking craft nearly
beoame a second edition of the Flying Dutchman, by finding himself
unable to see the pier (or rather he saw a great number too many
piers), and, consequently, to enter the harbour! The legend relates
that the strangely-steered vessel knocked about the bar until some
hours after the store of alcohol had been exhausted.
General Conclusion.—That the river flowing through London is
one of the finest sights in the world, and the most convenient high-
way imaginable, but that the fleet of steamboats is about as worthy
of the Thames as the Fleet Ditoh was worthy of Fleet Street. Cannot
some patriotic descendant of the immortal Van Tbomp, whose family
has been long enough settled in London to love it, sweep the existing
conveyances from the water, in emulation of his great ancestor, and
thus dear the road for vessels of better construction f Van Tbohf,
Vajj Tbomp—bearer of the mystio broom—to the rescue 1
SPEAKING "GENERALLY."
Not very long ago, Lord Napier of Magdala's suggestion that
Retired Officers of the Army should be employed in civil occupations,
was immoitalised by one of Mr. Punch's expertest Artists. A
General was represented as having cooked a chop to a cinder, ruined
a pair of boots in the vain attempt to polish them, and smashed the
hall-lamp while feebly striving to clean it. In spite of this discourage-
ment, other warriors (both British-born and foreign) still seek for
situations, as the following advertisements—out from the Daily
News of the 27th ult.—clearly demonstrate:—
GERMAN GENERAL, speaking little English, with good references,
open to immediate engagement.—To bo seen, &c.

It seems almost cruel to sneer at the evident desire of these
veterans to " make themselves generally useful." The appeal of the
two Generals with "good characters" (no playing whist until 2 a.m.
at the Senior or putting into the Derby Sweep at the Junior United
Servioe more than they can afford, but real good characters!") is
quite pathetic The aged soldiers, who no doubt have fought and
bled on many a well-contested field, are anxious to come " together,"
or should cruel fate otherwise deoree (stout, brave hearts !) "separate."
No doubt they would like to serve shoulder to shoulder, side by side,
say as cook and house and parlour-maid, or nurse and under-nnrse I
But business is business, and should there be only one vacancy, they
will dry their eyes, wipe the tears from their hoary moustaches, and
come "separate." Strange to say,theidea of Lord NAPiEBof Maodala
is not entirely original, but merely an adaptation from Mr. Pepts
In his Diary for the year 1665, just two hundred and thirty years
ago (this calculation deserves a prize for arithmetic!) the then
Seoretary to the Admiralty wrote:—
"It might have been better for the King to have his hands tied a
little than have such a crew about him, and be liable to satisfy the demands
of everyone about him. But what! You shall tee the captain turned a
shoemaker, the lieutenant a baker, this a brewer, that a haberdasher, the
common soldier a porter, and every man in his apron and frock, as if he had
never done anything else."
So the whirligig of Time turns on, making the General of the past
the shoeblack of the future, the Director of Warlike Stores of yester-
day the Manager of Co-operative Grocery of to-morrow I

LIKE SOME 0' THESE 'ERE NEW 'ARVEST DiCK'rATIONS!!
A SHOT IN THE DARK.
In his evidence given before the Committee on Building and Repairing Ships, the late
Director of Naval Construction has not much encouraging news for those who are looking
hopefully to some signs of progress in the Ordnance Department:—
"We may," (says this candid official) " design a ship for what we call a 40-ton gun. We do not know
what a 40-ton gun is; we do not know its charge; we do not know its projectile; we do not know its
length; we do not know its energy of recoil, although we hare to take it up. All our ships are designed
for an unknown gun. Beyond the knowledge that it will weigh about 40 tons, we know nothing, and we
have to wait for years before we do know."
This confession of absolute ignorance is not encouraging, yet, at the same time, there is a
plain-spoken ring about it that promises for
the future. It is something to have it on
such excellent authority, that for all intents
and purposes, one arm of the service is
working practically without any relation to
the other, and that while Woolwich is
turning out a "40-ton gun," Portsmouth
has not the remotest idea what that appa-
rently vaguely constructed weapon is like.
When the latter emporium boldly confesses
that all its ships are designed for "an
unknown gun," and in fact, in the lauguage
of the Laureate, roundly says, concerning
its own special business,
"Behold, we know not anything!"
it is high time that some one looked into
the matter, and such appears to be the
opinion of the late Director of Naval Con-
struction himself. That " we shall have to
wait years," as he suggests in a melancholy
vein, "before we do know," may, however,
be doubted, in the face of recent revelations.
The new Armour-clad about to be laid down
at Portsmouth will probably be designed to
hold a gun about which the Constructors
will have been furnished with some pre-
liminary particulars. After the admission
of their late Director, it is to be expected
that their own energy of recoil will be equal
to the task not only of taking the new gun
up, but also to making themselves judici-
ously acquainted with its length, the
amount of its charge, and even with the
character of its projeotile.
"READY, AY READY!"
The following bon mot, d propos of the
German and Spanish difficult/, that has
been going the round of Berlin," deserves,
so says the Correspondent of the Times, "to
be mentioned," and he furnishes it accord-
ingly. Here it is:—
"'Avez-vout recti del nouvellet det Caroline* V
inquired a member of the Telegraphic Conference
the other evening of the PoBtmuter-Oeneral at a
social fathering. 'Da tout,' replied his Excel-
lency Herr von Stephan, with ready wit, 'Du
tout; mats bien de tiouvelles Carolines. Yoild I
essayons !1 as he offered his interlocutor a box
of the best Havann&h brand, amid the applause
of the bystanders."
The story is, of course, excellent, and the
wit remarkably ready; and the applause of
the bystanders, who must have been
literally convulsed with laughter at this
brilliant and remarkable outburst of His
Excellency Herr Von Stephan, intelligible
enough. But what a pity that the humour
is so limited in the matter of quantity I
Evidently, when such a sally could be
launched off-hand—and the above shows
no signs of previous preparation—satire may
have been said to be in the very air. In
fact, a whole heap of good things must have
been flying about the other evening at the
Postmaster-General's social gathering.
Indeed one can only regret that the wary
Correspondent who is responsible for the
publicity accorded to this particular bon
mot, did not keep his ears wider open, and
ohronicle his experience. Had he done so,
all lovers of light-hearted mirth, tinged
with point and delicacy, would, to judge
from the single specimen that has reaohed
them, have had indeed quite a rare treat.
They ought certainly to look out eagerly for
the next good thing that is considered good
enough " to go the round of Berlin."
New (Spanish) Version of an Old
Proverb.—" Yap may be a good dog, but
Hold-fast is a bettor."

of them will, by their acts and deeds, be finally brought to a platform
composed of more planks than one.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [September 19, 1885.
FITZDOTTEREL; OR, T'OTHER AND WHICH?
(By the Earl of L-tt-n.)
"Supposing I was you,
Supposing you wa» me,
And supposing we both was somebody else,
I wonder who we should be?"
CANTO IV.—MuDDLEMENT.
Thebe is a legend—and a legend, told
In verse, at length, fills up a lot of space.—
'Tis of a Little Woman who, though old,
Was active, and assiduous in the chase
Of that great Magnet of Humanity—Gold.
One Market Day she to the Market Place
Set forth, at the best speed of her old legs,
To sell,—and her commodity was eggs.
But age, though active, is at times inclined
To somnolence inopportune. Our Dame,
Half way to Market, felt she had a mind
For forty winks. She was indeed to blame;
The King's Highway was really not designed
For ancient " Happy Dossers." All the same,
Stretohing herself upon the sloping sward,
She slept; some scholiasts even say she snored!
A passing Pedlar spied her prostrate form,
As, covered by her long grey linsey gown,
Beneath the hedge she slumbered snug and warm.
The Pedlar's name was Stout. An angry frown
Showed his strict soul was stirred as with a storm
Of indignation. Then he sat him down,
Drew forth his soissors (Here we do the tame,
And tnip out twenty stanzas trite and tame.)
"He out her petticoats all round about
Up to her knees." So says the naive old story.
'Tis probable the Dame and Pedlar Stout
A Sun Myth and a Mystio allegory
Adumbrate. I can traoe therein (No doubt!
But—snip.') A ballet-nymph in all her glory
Shows skirts less brief tban did our poor Dame Durden
As home that Pedlar plodded with his burden.
Knee-nipt by a North-Easter, she awoke,
Knowing herself no whit. "It is not I!"
She shrieked. This strikes me as a subtle stroke
Of poignant tragedy. Identity
Must not be trifled with; it is no joke
To lose one's self. That poor old Durden's cry
Sky-cleaving from beneath her cloak of camlet,
Is awfuller than the wail of inky Samlet.
So found Fitzdottebel. He got mixed and j ambled,
Like our old dame, beyond self-recognition,
And, to mend matters, he and Hermann tumbled
Down a crevasse together. Their position,
When found, was puzzling. Doom's dark voice had rumbled
About them bodingly; weird premonition
Had dogged them close. And now the thing was ended,
They found poor Hermann by a rope suspended.
Beevob had thrown it to his aid,—it coiled,
Serpent-like, round his throat. The hand of Fate
May not be dodged, nor Doom's decrees be foiled I
Down, down they flew; Fitzdotterel's very weight
His friend's last slender chance of safety spoiled.
Slung o'er a peak they found them, all too late,
Suspended, Beevob by his waist, and Hermann
By his snapt neck. Poor rash, rough-tempered German I
This for the local press was food most dear,
And thus 'twas summed :—" We hear, with deep regret,
The dreadful death of a young English Peer,
One Lord Fitzdottebel." (Full details, you bet,
Here follow.) "His companion, mere small beer
Of Teuton tap, it seems, is living yet:
Though—having interviewed his lady-nurse—
We fear no case of smash could well be worse."
Ah! poor Polonius-Edelweisb! He read
This "par." some three months later. "Heavens!" he
shouted,
"Wondrous is Fate— and Science! Beevob dead,
And by a sus. per col..' And I half doubted
Heredity, my life-long hobby, led
By love, which theory and experience flouted!
Awful! Delightful! I" Here he tore his hair.
A Savant's triumph, and a Sire's despair,
Mixed, make a queer emotional salad. Mixed t
All Life, like Teas, is mixed, the black the green
In varying proportions, which betwixt
Kong-fu-tzee's—(Scissors sharp through seventeen
Stanzas on Souchong.') Edelweiss soon fixed
To hunt up IIekmann; hut Evangeline
Had fewer rambles after her strayed lover
Than Edelweiss in striving to recover
Traces of Pumpernicrel. Souls are harried—
In fiction—by Fatality's machination.
Lost clues, long illnesses, missives miscarried,
All sorts of cob-web fashioned complications,
(Until of oourse they onoe get safely married)
So few were else Romance's " situations"
'Twould puzzle e'en a poet, and a Tory,
To fill two vols, octavo with this story.
Those who have some experience in such things,
Would be exceedingly surprised to hear,
That the fortuitous angel without wings.
Who nursed " the comrade of the fated peer,"
Was other than " Lone Gretchen." Fate that brings
Such miracles about, to our dull sphere,
Would lend a charm beyond all contradiction,
If it would not confine them all to fiction.
Lone Gbetchen nursed him baok- of oourse —to life.'
This—well the Little Woman, when she woke
From wayside slumber, felt less mental strife
As to her own identity. 'Tis no joke,
Especially when one would woo a wife,
To halt, like Bubidan's oft-mentioned " Moke,"
Between two selves, as fogged as Lord Dundreary
O'er finger-counting. Beevob grew quite weary
Of asking " Is it If" and envied mueh
The Little Woman her unerring dog,
Whose bark could put the question to the touch.
8o stumbled he in doubt's Serbonian bog.
Nosce teipsum f Nay, how could he clutch
Comfort in that, as, lying like a log,
He passed long weeks in a perpetual pother,
Revolving Who is Which, and Which is T 'other?
"Oh, for some sweet, all-solving Strawberry mark!"
He murmured, memories of Box and Cox
Glimmering through his spirit's mental dark.
But no, the nigritude of Ancient Nox
Environed still his spirit's storm-tost bark.
Meanwhile Lone Gbetchen, of the oohre locks,
Watched, listened, and amidst his broken blether—
'Cute Teuton maid!—" put this and that together."
Lone Gbetchen was—well, lump all Shaxspeabe's ladies
With Becky Sharp and a Mesmerio Medium,
And you will have her. Proserpine in Hades,
Or Psyche in Boootia. (There is tedium

TOURING IN THE HIGHLANDS.
"Hullo, Sandy! Why haven't you cleaned my Carriage,
as i told you last nlqht!"
"Hech, Sib, what for would it need Washing? It will be
just the same when you 'll be using it again!"
EXTRACTS FROM THE DIARY OF AN EMINENT
CITIZEN.
I ah spending my month's holiday in the Isle of Thanet. I select
this particular portion of the land of my birth because I meet here a
large number of acquaintances to whom fortune, or rather perhaps, I
should say strict integrity, has not been so propitious as to myself,
and who have learned to treat me with that abundant respect that is
so creditable to them, and so agreeable to me. I like to mingle with
my inferiors in position, and learn from them, as occasion offers, such
additions to my somewhat limited scientific acquirements as their
practical experience enables them to afford me.
I am by the sea-shore, in view of the boundless ocean 1 I look. I
am told, straight to the North Pole, with nothing between us but the
rolling billows—shall I add the treacherous billows? Yes, 1 think
so, with the experience of yesterday fresh in my memory, I learn
to my intense astonishment—after the fuss people make about going
there—that the exact distance from the spot where I am now sitting
—on a deserted castle of dry sand—to the actual Pole itself, is a mere
2679 miles, considerably less than the distance to New York! The
thought then flashes upon me, as the one voyage can be done in less
than a week, why not the other? I pause for a reply. Perhaps Sir
Erasmus will kindly enlighten me.
I feel so elated with my great discovery that I hasten home to my
early dinner with perfectly ravenous appetite. Here, strange to say,
another interesting scientific fact is revealed to me of which I was
previously in entire ignorance. I have remarked that the various
drinks in which I moderately indulge, for my stomach's sake—but
not, let me add, by way of outward application, as has been suggested
by a fanatio teetotal Curate—have diminished in quantity with
strange rapidity, but I now learn on the unimpeachable authority of
my most attentive Landlady, that it is the natural result of the pure
air of the briny Ocean which always produces rapid evaporation, and.
strange to say, with much more rapidity in regard to Port ana
Brandy than to Claret.
I gave a recherche dinner last night to a few choioe friends, and
perhaps as a natural consequence, I again find myself seated on
Ocean's brink, reasoning out some of the great problems of life. How
the usual difficulties seem to vanish when one is seated face to face
with Nature. I ask myself the three great questions that so puzzled
the Seven Wise Men of Rome.
Whence came I? What am I? Whither go I? And I find
not the slightest difficulty in answering all three. Probably the
absence of Railways and Directories in those old days may have had
something to do with the making of that so difficult that appears so
simple to me. How diffioultiss bend before a stubborn will I Like
the bow of Ulysses in the hand of the Syren! I am watching with
absorbing interest the determined efforts of three juvenile engineers
—the Brummells of the future, possibly, who knows ?—to protect
their lofty castle from the assaults of the rapidly advancing tide.
I have removed my hat from my somewhat feverish brow, and
placed it carefully on the dry sand beside me. The fresh
sparkling waves come lovingly up to the lofty battlements to woo
their fond embrace. What glorious poetry there is in the very
breath of the loving Sea!—but in vain. The deeply out trench re-
ceives and subdues them, and they retreat to join their laughing
comrades. Nearer and nearer they come, and harder and harder
work the undaunted engineers in raising still higher and higher the
lofty battlements, till a mighty wave approaches, and, like Napoleon
at the Bridge of Areola, carries all before it, and not only rushes
clean over the topmost tower of the lofty castle, but to my great and
doubtless unconcealed astonishment, continues its mad career to my
comfortable seat, soaks me to the skin before I can recover either my
presence of mind or my new hat, whioh I see carried off by the
retiring wave as the spoils of war.
A loud shout of laughter greets me as I beat a masterly retreat to
a friendly rock, safely standing upon whioh, I negotiate with one of
the bold though youthful engineers, for the recovery of my lately
new hat, which I at length obtain on fairly moderate terms, but in
such a dilapidated and disreputable condition that I am compelled to
Beek another—unfortunately catching a bad cold by wearing it on my
way—and, strange to say, am repeatedly asked the perfeotly un-
interesting question, "Who's your hatter?" and by quite common
persons with whom I have, of course, no sort of acquaintance. How
unaccountable is this strange curiosity of the mere canaille concerning
quite unimportant matters. I well remember some years ago I used
to be asked, by perfect strangers, concerning the knowledge of my
maternal parent as to my absence from home.
One thing that greatly surprises me is the consummate ignorance
of the Sailors as regfjps the weather. On three several occasions
have I trusted to their long experience, and accepted their perfeotly
unbiassed opinion that we should have a lovely afternoon, and on each
of these occasions have we all been bitterly disappointed, and the
regret of the honest fellows that they have so unwittingly deceived
me has been so poignant, that I have felt it only reasonable to
alleviate it in some small degree by paying them on each occasion
double the sum I should have paid them had it been a nice bright
afternoon. Poor fellows I it was quite sad to see how wet their shiny
clothes were.
One of them told me he was so afraid of what he called " 1thu-
matios," that he was foroed to drink a glass of hot rum-and-water
whenever he got at all wet, so of course I felt bound in honour to
pay for one for him, on these several occasions. I should not like to
have it on my conscience that I had been the cause of the poor fellow
suffering all the tortures of rheumatism from his desire to give me a
pleasant sail on a sunny sea. Joseph Greenhorn.

WHAT IT USED TO BE!"
SOME MORE CONFESSIONS.
To the Editor of the T-m-s.
Sib,—What your Correspondent, Mr. Samuel Roberts, of Elmer Rosd, Woodside, 8.E.,
acknowledges that he used to do in conoooting " Special Correspondence" for a Paris news-
paper, is absolutely nothing to what is done constantly in England. When I was on the Staff
of the Hole Haven Daily Arous, we frequently forged and inserted letters bearing such
well-known signatures as "W. E. Gladstone," "Salisbury," &o., and was nev-r once
authoritatively contradicted! Perhaps the distinguished Statesmen I have named did not
habitually peruse the Hole Haven Argus.
But I think our real masterpiece was the forging of a bogus telegram from the Soudan,
giving details of Abu Klea fifteen hours before the battle was fought.' We only made a
trifling error of a few hundreds in the numbers killed, and put the site of the battle a thousand
miles nearer Khartoum than it really was. But what of that? It was considered a jour-
nalistic triumph (by our readers), and was due entirely to powerful imaginations and a
perusal of Mr. Murray's valuable Quide-Book to Egypt.
Soon afterwards we published a leading article, consisting simply of two whole pages
stolen from MaCaulay, and nobody found
us out! A slight dispute with the Propria
tors as to the value of my services, termi-
nated in my summary ejection from the
Argus premises; but I assure you I bear
the paper no ill-will. Still, I was not sur-
prised when I saw that the Editor had found
ohange of air on the Continent imperatively
necessary after the publication of that on
dit about the Archbishop of Canterbury
having been convioted, in earlier days, at
the Central Criminal Court, for forging his
own Ordination Certificate. I say I was
not surprised—the Argus deserved what it
got for having dispensed with the ingenious
pen of Yours obediently,
Sept. 20th. Ex-Editor.
To the Editor of the T-m-s.
Sir,—At the present moment I am resid-
ing in Camberwell, but a few months since
I was in Paris, where I ocoupied a really im-
portant journalistic position. It was owing
to my complete mastery of every existing
foreign language (and a good many that never
existed at all) that I was appointed to the
simultaneous offices of "Special Correspon-
lent with the Black Flags," to the G-l-s,
'Our Own Commissioner in the Cholera
Districts" to the"' Intr-ns-g-nt," and" Speoial
Correspondent in Madagascar" to the
"F-g-ro," besides doing an occasional
(bogus) "Interview" with some prominent
Politician or Social Star.
You ask how this is worked? Nothing
simpler. You (or rather I) collect all the
available newspapers published in the dif-
ferent countries where one is supposed to be,
which is the case of Tonquin or Madagascar
is not a urotraoted ta>k. Then you read
whatthe Enoyoloprodias havetosay about the
climate, local oustoms, appearance of natives,
and so on; if you can get huld of a trust-
worthy, and at the same time an unknown,
book of travels, so much the better.
In this adroit manner one gets as much
local colour as is needed, and the total result
is a Literary Mosaio of a very rare and valu-
able quality. Its value to me (weekly) was
a couple of hundred francs.
Yours unblushingly, Jeremy Skip.
To the Editor of the T-m-s.
Sib,—Your artiole on Gaols is one of the
be&t things I've seen in print for a long
time. You remark that it may be ques-
tioned whether it is altogether wise to put
high-class criminals, of the embezzling and
financially fraudulent class, to herd with
professional pickpoeketsand househreakers."
I don't know about the wisdom of this ar-
rangement, but I can bear personal testimony
to its being most unpleasant.
I feel sure that confirmation of your
Editorial remarks, from any quarter, will
be welcome. It will perhaps be enough for
yonr readers if I say that I was "in" at
Dartmoor for a crime in which forgery, em-
bezzlement, the manslaughter of a partner
in a sham Stock Exchange Agency, and
attempted arson, were the chief features of
any publio interest.
Believe me, Sir, the brutal Governors of
Gaols have no idea of what is due to social
rank. I expected, of course, to be treated
like what I was, and always shall continue
to be, I hope, namely—a gentleman I But
the whole bodv of warders treated me as a
Common Convict 1 When I threatened to
write to the T-m-s, I was put in a punish-
ment cell for twelve hours; and I now take
the earliest opportunity (on my liberation
from confinement) to carry out that threat.

please return), and remain,

A SHORT HOLIDAY CRUISE.
Imp—The Struggle—Exorcised—Triumph—Up again—Dinner

First Afternoon.—In my own cabin: lying on my berth. Iam
going through the prooeBs of '' getting it over." The oure takes about
seven hours. At
some time or
other, probably
one o'clock or
half - past, the
Steward looks in
to announce lun-
cheon. Attentive,
but superfluous.
I do not reply.
Happy Thought
(Advertisement
Form).—'' Silence
will be considered
a polite nega-
tive."
Here we go up, up, up! Here we go down, down, down! And
here we go round, round, round, oh! But I have a firm faith in
the future, founded upon some considerable experience in the past.
They are comparatively quiet on deck; the only disturbance is from
a most irritating cupboard-door which hasn't been properly fastened,
and so swings backwards and forwards, creaking all the while, then
at every lurch coming with a startling whack against the wash-hand
stand. Creak, creak, creak, creak, creak, whack 1 Creak, oreak,
whack, whack! Creak, creak—rather slowly now—oree-ak, cree-ak,
oreeee-ak, then suddenly and vivaciously, whack, whack, whack!
and so on until we " go about," when it shuts itself with a Bang that
I hope has secured it for ever. But no, as the yacht pitches forward,
taking a header with its bows, the door is swung violently open, as if
there were somebody inside who had been locked up in the cupboard
for hours, and at his last gasp had foroed the look with one supreme
effort. I almost expect to see someone tumble out. If anyone does
tumhle out, it can't r>e a burglar; it might be a ghost.
Happy Thought for Christmas Tale.—The Haunted Yacht. (I
hereby patent the idea for my own shilling dreadful.) What might
it have been—this occurs to me drowsily—if not a burglar or a ghost?
A Stowaway. I am dozing off, dreaming of Stowaways, when slowly
the performance begins again—creeee-ak—oree-ak—suddenly crik,
whack! whack'.—pause—then, quite as a little surprise, it closes
with a startling whop Bang! like the two beats on the big drum at
the end of some march—the one in the Prophete, I think. I am
sure there are such beings as Imps, mischievous Imps—the spirits,
high spirits of practical jokers yet unborn, or of undeveloped
practical jokers who had only appeared in the world for a few hours,
or weeks, and then—quite in keeping with their character, not
caring what trouble and grief they caused their parents—departed
this life without the slightest explanation. II faut qu'une porte soit
ouverte ou fermie, and if I can only get off my berth to fix it, without
endangering my enfeebled constitution, I will. I raise myself on my
elbow, and regard it interrogatively, as muoh as to say. "Now are
you going on like this the whole afternoon, or will you be quiet P"
And the Imp in the cupboard seems to understand what is passing
in my mind, for the door remains closed and appears to fit so neatly,
that I can scarcely believe I haven't been dreaming. So I lie down
again and close my eyes.
In a few seoonds I am conscious of the wardrobe-door being
stealthily opened with scarcely any noise. I look at it, wondering
what its next move will be, and what mine will be too. It remains
open at right angles, as if hesitating which way to go, when, without
any warning, there is a lurch forward, a roll, and the door gives a sharp
angry oreak and whacks the washing-stand on the left, then slams
itself back, then reopens and again attacks the inoffensive washing-
stand, so savagely, that I am compelled to scramble off my berth,
stagger up to the rescue, and with both hands shove the door back to
its proper place. But the handle won't catch. Not being in the
habit of carrying about patent door-fasteners in my pocket, I have no
appliance ready. I am repulsed. I own my defeat, and stagger
baok to my berth.
Then the Imp is in ecstasies, creaking, whacking, banging, until
I fear that great damage will be done to the furniture, ana I look
in vain for some means of summoning the Steward, or of attracting
the attention of anyone on deok. But impossible: I see no bell,
and as for calling—my vocal cords are in such a relaxed state that
I can scarcely speak above a whisper. Fortunately at this juncture
the Steward appears, and in the feeblest accents I draw his attention
to the outrageous conduct of the cupboard-door, as if it were a
living thing, muoh in the same way as I might have complained to a
keeper of a neighbouring menagerie that the monkey had got loose
again, and was causing us much annoyance.
The Keeper—I mean the Steward—is quite vexed at its mis-
conduct, but deals with it at once; walking up to it in a masterful
manner—the door not daring to move now, and absolutely quivering
with fear as he approaches,—and then stuffing in a couple of impro-
vised paper wedges, which produoe the desired effect.
"There!" says the Steward, vindictively, as though this was not
the first time the door of this cupboard had played him these tricks,
"I don't think it'11 do it again, Sir."
For a few minutes after the Steward's departure I watch the door
with nervous anxiety; but no, the Imp is bottled up, and the paper
wedges have imprisoned him in the wardrobe as closely as Solomon's
seal did the Genie in the Arabian Nights' tale. So, thankfully I
begin to doze. The lurching and the pitching have ceased to mate-
rially affect me. I hear the Composer's voice above, and I hope to
goodness that he won't enter into an argument—he seldom talks
without arguing—requiring any great exercise of voioe just over my
skylight But ne too is evidently "piano." The "pitch" has been
too high for him. I fancy that he either onoe more disappears below
or subsides into a chair on deok.
I receive " a refresher" from Nature in the shape of a short sound
sleep, and at seven I am perfectly ready for dinner and a glass of
champagne. "We anchor in a quiet bay with a name something like
Mackracken, but as there is nothing muoh to see here, and as we shall
be off early to-morrow morning, I am not sufficiently interested to
make any further inquiries.
Our party consists of four, Melleville, our host, Culliws the
Composer, and a jovial gentleman with a double-barrelled name—FoKD-
Bamly, whioh only seems to me to require the addition of " and
Co." to constitute him a firm.
First Night on Board.—Awoke early next morning. Usual noise
of scrubbing and rubbing just overhead and within a few inches of
my nose, and the idea occurs to me that I am buried somewhere
and being walked over!
[ Happy Thought.—Racing notion. "Walking over a oorse!"]
Hauling and pulling and yeo-ho-ing. Not much movement, except
an occasional slow swing from one side to the other and then very deli-
berately baok again. Presently the rapid rippling of water against the
sides, and I know we are under weigh and gilding on with a fair wind.
On deok. Delightful. I recognise old Jura and other former
acquaintances.
Breakfast.—We are all on in this scene, and it is, I am bound to say,
a very fair performance taken all round, though one out of the
number does not do sufficient justice to the excellent materials pro-
vided by the author. This one is myself. I explain that as a rule I
am not a break fast-eater. Cullins explains that as a rule he is, but
is not quite in form this morning, so he only takes fish, poached eggs,
and ham, a little tongue, some marmalade, and then hopes that
"when he gets quite acclimatised, he will be able to play a good solo
part, as well as join in the quartette."
For the last week of August, it is fairly warm on deok. Sun
shining sufficiently for us to make some show with our books—whioh
we never read—and papers and pencils whioh we never use. So we
sit enjoying existence, far away from the madding oro wd, no morning
papers, no afternoon second editions, no sensational news, no possi-
bility of letters or telegrams reaching us—unless postmen pursue us
in special steam-
ers, as we are only
sailing — and no
"little accounts,"
nor intimations
that "our Mr.
Jones will call
to - morrow to
receive the sum
of, &c, &c."
"A life on the
Ocean wave, and
a home on the
rolling deep "—
rolling as little
as possible, of
course — by all
means, for these
are the joys—no matter about the sorrows—of such an existence.
"We '11 never comeback no more, boys!" we feel inclined to sing;
hut at some time or other, unless we become Pirates and the Terror
of the Northern Seas, we inevitably must go ashore for provisions.

THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.
Feom a Temporarily Retired Statesman.
Wilderneit Lodge,
Near Boundless- Contiguity-of-Shade,

ear Toby,
Thanes for your kind inquiry.
I'm pretty well, that is as well as
I ought to he in the circumstances.
I am not very ill, hut just ill
enough to give up my engagements
and frighten the Markiss and the
rest of them. You may perhaps
have noted a peculiarity ahout my
present indisposition. Any ordinary
man can he ill to-day, and may
even guess he won't he quite spry
to-morrow. But I don't fancy you
often come across a man, who, on
the 10th of September, can an-
nounce that he won't he well
enough on the 6th of October to
deliver a speech. That's what I
call fresh and original; but I'm
nothing if not original.
One other thing I am, and since
correspondence with you has led
me into a mood of introspection, I
may mention it. I am a man of a singularly retiring disposition.
The Markiss once said that I reminded him of the peevish little boy,
who, when he did not get his own way among his schoolmates, tucked
the corner of his pinafore in his eye, whined " I won't play," and
sulked. But that was said a long time ago. You don't catch the
Markiss saying disrespectful things of me now.
I don't accept the Markiss's way of putting it, preferring my own.
I am, I say, of a retiring disposition, and I don't know anything that
is so effective, at least with the people I work with. You remember
when there was that little row about the Chairmanship of the volu-
minously named Association, more briefly known as the Conservative
Caucus P I became suddenly indisposed, threw up the whole business,
and was brought back in triumph through Arlington Street. That was
the time I was to have gone down to Birmingham. But 1 threw them
over, and they were all the more pleased to see me next time. Then
there came the Cabinet arrangements which did not please me. At
first I was taken ill, and retired from all communication with the
Markiss. But that, I saw, was a moment rather for advancing than
for retiring. So I came down to the House, made a sudden assault
on N-rthc-te, and M-cn-L B-ce, seeing how the game was going,
forsook the good old Man and came over to me.
After that I had my own way in everything. But now they 're at
it again; and so am I. They want me to denounce P-rn-ll because
he's sketched out a plan that means separation. Well, I won't, and
why should IP P-rn-ix put us into office. He may even keep us
there. If he doesn't, we may run together in opposition. Why
should I go out of my way to flout him? The question of separation is
not before us. When it comes, let us consider it. In the meantime
I am not the man, for the sake of a bit of sentiment, to estrange a
useful ally. The Markiss says we'll have the whole country, in-
cluding the Conservative Party, howling at us if we don't put our
foot down on this question. Let them howl. The question for us is,
which course gives us more immediate advantage, to break with
P-rit-ll now, or to hold on as long as we can P I'm for the latter
policy. The rest stand by the other, and so, suddenly, in the twink-
ling of an eye, I'm struck down in the very buoyancy of my youthful
health, and shall not be better before the 6th of October.
That's all about it, Toby, dear boy, and you will excuse me
Srattling on about myself. But you know I am at least equally
uent with respect to others.
By the way, I am sitting for my portrait, which is to be finished in
time for next Academy. It's rather a fancy notion. I am standing
in my room at the India Office, with my lips to the telephone. At
the other end of the telephone is India, patiently and submissively
awaiting my instructions and decisions. The Markiss says the
picture "wants balance." But he's always saying something. I
think it's rather a taking notion. Do you P
Ever yours, R-nd-lph S. Ch-hch-ll.
To Toby, M.P., The Kennel, Barks,
P.S.—Had a funny correspondence with H-rt-ngt-n about my
Come-over-and-help-us speech the other day. Waited forty-eight
hours apparently brooding over it. Then wrote :—" Dear R-nd-lph,
Who's Us P Yours faithfully, H-rt-ngt-n." I replied :—" Dear
H-rt-ngt-n, Us is Me. Yours faithfully, R-nd-lph.'] Haven't
heard from him since. Expect he's thinking over proposition.

Latest Intelligence a la Mode.
GERMANY AND SPAIN.
Berlin, Sept. 22.
It is officially announoed that the Marquis de Benomar had this
afternoon a protracted interview with Count Herbert Bismarck.
The exact nature of the meeting has not fully transpired, but enough
has leaked out to give rise to certain disquieting rumours, that acted
unfavourably on closing prices at the Bourse. The report, though
lacking full confirmation, gains ground that the Minister has been
entrusted with the return of the young King's Uhlan uniform to the
German Emperor, and that, owing either to want of precedent or to
any convenient place in whioh to keep it, the Count has courteously
but firmly declined to receive it. This line of conduct has, it is said,
embarrassed the Spanish Representative. The report that a torpedo-
fleet had left Kiel for Peninsular waters with'' sealed orders, "requires
confirmation.
Madrid. Sept. 22.
In semi-official circles here the report that Germany has, pending
negotiations, hoisted her flag on several dozen of the smaller islands,
gains ready credence, and causes profound irritation. In the face of
existing events the attitude of the Navy is attracting some notice in
moderate political circles, all the Admirals, Post-Captains, and Senior
Officers at the three naval Arsenals having expressed, through the
Minister of Marine, their determination to see the honour of the
Service vindicated, after the recent action at Yap, by an immediate
rise of pay in all its branches. The Spanish Navy has always been
liberally inclined, and Senor Canotas del Castillo will have to be
very guarded in his conduct in dealing with its ruffled susceptibili-
ties. The situation, however, does not give rise to any serious alarm.
The journal El Correo hears, on good authority, that the Govern-
ment are in negotiation with the General Steam Navigation Company
for the purchase of their fleet of steamers plying between London
and Boulogne. The report needs official confirmation.
Berlin, Sept. 23.
It is stated in well-informed circles here, that the reply of the
Spanish Government to the English Note, recommending Arbitration
in the Caroline Islands question, is couched in excessively warm and
indignant language, and has been despatched to the Cabinet at
St. James's. It is argued that Lord Salisbury will know well how to
answer it, and that a fresh complication will arise that will give a
decidedly favourable turn to events. Meantime, trmnks full of
returned German orders continue to arrive by parcels post from irri-
table Spanish Generals, at the official residence of the Minister of War,
but as that functionary declines to take them in, they are promptly
returned again to the senders through the Dead-letter Office.
The Marquis de Benomar had a further interview, this afternoon,
with Count Herbert Bismarck, and it is understood that though
the price to be paid for the repairs to the German Embassy at Madrid,
and for the purchase of the new shield and flag-staff, gave rise to a
lengthy discussion, a general good accord was preserved. The rumour
that, with a view to coming eventualities, the Government have
ordered the Mobilisation of the Pomeranian Horse Marines, is, at
present, devoid of any foundation.
Madrid, Sept. 23.
The tension of feeling in this Capital still continues to be very
acute, and much anxiety is manifested in moderate circles as to the
action of the Army, several Generals of exalted rank having expressed
themselves loudly yesterday evening, on the Prado, in favour of
tossing up with half-a-crown for a policy. It is not, however, thought
that a. pronunciamiento will pay those most interested in it, and in that
f act lies the security of the country. The report that the King has
secretly abdicated in favour of the Emperor William, and has taken
a money payment down for the provinces of Aragon and Castile, and
the drawing-room furniture at Aranjucz, though industriously circu-
lated by the more Liberal portion of the Press, has as yet failed to
gain anything more than partial credence.

Of whit is the Old Man thinking-,
As he sits in his Study Chair,.
From the crowd's hot tumult shrinking,
And the platform's brazen blare f
The eyes of the Old Man glow.
As he thinks of the coming fray,
Though his voice sounds faint and low,
And his locks look scant and grey.
The younger arouud are sinking
Their tones with attentive care.
Of what is the Old Man thinking,
As he sits in his Study Chair f
'Tin not with a vain repining
That the Old Man lingers nere;
'Tim not o'er his strength declining
He broods on the waning year.
There's a spell in the clarion's tray,
And his eyes are far from dim;
And the near November day
Means battle onoe more for him.
From the held he's not found shrinking.
But a Leader's task brings care.
Of what is the Old Man thinking,
As he sits in his Study Chair P
Of his fifty years of fighting I
Of his anoient foemen dead!
Of the wrongs that yet need righting I
Of the ills that still make head!
Of the ranks that wait his word I
Of the choice of battle-ground!
Of the warring watchwords heard I
Of the clashing cries that sound 1
Of the ticklish task of linking
Squadrons in order fair!
Of this is the Old Man thinking
As he sits in his Study Chair f
His Captains young and eager,
Like hounds in leash they strain
The foes' stronghold to 'leaguer,
The citadel to regain.
And some would charge like thunder,
And some like Fabics wait,
And some would hotly blunder,
Some coldly lag too late.
Unhaeting, yet unshrinking,
The host must forward fare.
Of that is the Old Man thinking
As he aits in his Study Chair f
See, see, his firm lips tighten!
He holds the battle-plan.
Behold his tired eyes brighten!
His place is in the van.
To marshal that mixed host
Demands his long-tried skill.
Forward to the old post!
He must, and faith he w ill!
No resting yet, no shrinking;

MORE LIGHT.
Sib, Mr. Punch,
I have, in common with many others
of your readers, been perusing lately—much,
however, to my individual oonfusion—that
correspondence that has appeared in the Times,
dealing with the subject of "The Standard of
Light/' The question raised by "A. V. H."
as to the moral rtotitude of Gas Companies on
the one hand, and of Candle Makers on the
other, no less than his definition of a " stand-
ard tent-candle," and " 16-oandle gas," with
all the ins and outs about curvature of wick,
snuffing, and what not, leaves me, for all its
illuminating talk, praotioally in the dark.
For what 1 find in the standard of light, the
only standard I am acquainted with, is any-
thing but illumination. I don't know how
to use a photometer, nor do I understand the
test of a pure spermaceti car die, but 1 do know
that the gas that is supplitd to me by a mono-
polising company not only falls short of any
respeotable standard of lieht whatever, but
fills my rooms with a stifling compound of
smoke and sulphur, that blackens my wall-
papers, ruins my furniture, and chokes me and
my guests. What are the Electric Lighting
Companies about P They alone oan rescue us
from the fume and the gloom to which the gas
monopoly at present consigns us. Talk of the
standard of light, indeed I The true standard
is not in 15 or 16-oandle gas, but in that incan-
descent light which gives you the brightness
almost of day. Yours, impatiently,
One in the Dark.

THE TOURIST IN TOWN.
THE INNER CIRCLE RAILWAY.
On the Threshold.—You are struck hy the appearance of the
Stations, which are, as a rule, one-third brick to two-thirds Adver-
tisement-hoards, arguing that the majority of the Directors are not,
to say the least, quite as (esthetic as Ruskin. Taste is not considered
in the dividend, so "blowholes" appear amongst the trees of the
Embankment Gardens, and the lines of many a graceful building ore
hidden beneath hideous posters telling of the triumphs of rapid loco-
motion. When the extension was made from Westminster to the
Mansion House, the line was facetiously described as the " Daylight
Station Route," on the strength of the Stations being either glazed
or open to the air at the top. Deceived by this announcement, many
a careless pleasure-seeker (missing the previous word, "Station )
descended into the bowels of the earth, promising himself a ride
beside riverian scenery of no uncommon excellence, to find that the
homowpathic doses of daylight were lost in miles of sulphurous tun-
neling. But although the Directors showed something of the nature
of the wily serpent in describing the subterranean route in such a
way as to suggest soft summer breezes and gently-waving trees,
they exhibited less artfulness in their posters relative to the advan-
tages of their Stations. Whenever a new resting-place was opened
for the benefit of the Public, the Directors considered it advisable
to point out the special advantages of the site. Thus, passengers
booking for Mark Lane were informed that they would have the
great privilege of being near enough to the Tower'of London " to pay
it a visit," and others going to Putney would find themselves, on
arriving at their destination, ripe for " Boating on the River."
At the Booking Offices.—Every convenience for making mistakes.
Before each pigeon-hole is a barrier that seems to say, "If you
are in the least portly, you will be crushed to death while taking
your ticket," and over the opening appears a startling placard, which
distracts your attention from everything else, Beware of Pick-
pockets." Squeezed and distrustful you approach the window, to find
it sometimes closed; hut, should it be opened, there is usually a
Clerk behind it, seemingly doing anything rather than attending to
the public. "Second single, Biackfriars, please," you murmur, in
a conciliatory tone. The Clerk continues adding up a row of
"A Good Shillingsworth."—Not a very easy thing
to find nowadays. For instance a couple of copies of
Bradshaw's "Official" Railway Guide axe scarcely worth
the sum, save as assistance in concocting rather cruel
practical jokes. Again, "A really Good Dinner for a
Shilling" is frequently an extremely bad investment, in
spite ot its title. Once more, a place in the gallery at
the theatres is never worth twelve pence, save and except
at Drury Lane, where the deservedly successful Human
Nature, the best of modern melodramas, is being played
nightly to overflowing audiences. However, it appears
just now that a " Good Shillingsworth " can be found not
only at Drury Lane, but at every bookstall in the kingdom,
in the shape (the convenient-for-the-pooket shape) of The
Dark House: a Knot Unravelled. This, the latest of
Mr. George Manville Fenn's works, is also one of his
best—high praise where all are good. The exciting story
is capital reading, at all times, for the slowly-departing
"open air" or the gradually-coming fireside. The name
of its Author is appropriately suggestive of both seasons.
It not only hints at summer in the country, but carries
us half-way to the fender I

vague or invidious. Which " story " does he mean? Is

figures, or telling a story to a colleague. You repeat your request,
even in beseeching accents. Annoyed at being disturbed, the
Clerk looks at you superciliously, snaps out, "Next window!" and
returns to his former employment. Having at length secured your
ticket, you descend a flight of badly-lighted stairs, to find a door
flung in your face the moment you arrive at the bottom. However,
you will nave something to look at—the train you were striving to
oatch leisurely waiting before leaving the station.
The Carriage Accommodation.—Miserable. To begin with, the
handles to the doors are frequently dirty enough to spoil any kid
glove of an alternative colour to black. If you happen to be going
to a wedding in lavender or pale straw, you will find the palm of
your right hand quaintly decorated, if you attempt to get in or out
without assistance. To continue—at certain hours of the day or
night the carriages are cruelly overcrowded. In each compartment
you will find, besides the regulation number of seated occupants,
a crowd of people treading upon one another's toes, who have rushed
in, regardless of consequences,—it is to be hoped that an accident
will not happen on one of these occasions, or assuredly somebody or
other will be put on his trial for manslaughter. About half-a-minute
is the regulation time allowed for stopping at each Station, so that
if you happen to have taken a ticket tor a carriage whose class is
situated at the end of the platform opposite to that of your entrance,
you have to scamper along the boards amidst an unruly mob until,
breathless from exertion, you reach your destination. The Guard,
seeing you ooming, when you have completed about a third of your
way, raises his arm, and shouts, "All right!" This makes you
double your exertions, and, pale and exhausted, you are huddled in
with the demand, "Now then, Sir, are you going on?" Once seated,
you would go to Bleep were it not that at every Station you are kept
awake by the reckless banging of the doors. It may be added, to pre-
serve a balance, much time is consumed by pauses in the tunnels.
The Atmosphere.—Very bad, indeed; sometimes (especially in the
summer) it is intolerable. At Portland Road Station, for instance, a
descent to the platform means, to many people, a violent fit of cough-
ing. The mist of sulphurous vapour often reminds one of a black
November fog—and is twioe as disagreeable.
Conclusion.—Whenever it is more convenient to go another way,
do not insist upon the Inner Circle Railway!

Oh! who's for a peep at the Paddook? Our scions of race love the Raoe. [ Beams blandly above him Y That back and that hat with the genial
rake,
And here muster types of swell manhood and stars of patrician she'

Place avx damet! To the right shines the beautiful Countess of
March ; at her tide
The Honourable Mrs. Cadogan. Lord Rothschild, with natural
pride.
Confronts them near Newmarket Frederick. Beaufort and
'Westmoreland stand,
The one with his hand on his breast, and the other with book in his
hand.
Next Westminster's Duke, just behind, and, then hat-cocked, com-
placent and cool,
Ineffable Chaplin himself, to whom Statesmen must put them to
School,
Economists bow, turfmen meekly defer, and the farmers kotow.
Below—in position, of course, not in merit, that none will allow I—
The young Duke of Portland, ex-Guardsman, conversing with
Scotia's chief pride,
Smart, versatile, genial Rosebeby. When he—alas! stands aside
From tips and turf-honours, they'll mourn him; but then Glad-
stone's " Primrose" is entered
For a race that is other than hippie, in which his ambition is centred,
And which the 'cute Earl "stands to win," if the omens the world
reads aright.
Between them you see Sir George Wombwell, fox-hunter of ardour
and might,
Whom the flat may less charm than 'cross country. Is this that
illustrious Peer

All may know the superlative "Fred." "Archer up!" cries the

And who " upper " than he with his fellows this prince of the spur

FITZDOTTEREL; OR T'OTHER AND WHICH P
{By the Earl of L-tt-n.)
"Supposing I HI you,

And supposing we both was Bomebody else,
I wonder who we should be."
Canto V.—The Last Metempbtchomorphosis.
All over? Not a bit of it! I guess
A second volume must be filled somehow.
That means a thousand stanzas, more or less.
Eight thousand lines! The knowing dog's bow-wow
Settled that Little Woman's awful mess,
But this is no mere Nursery Tale, I trow.
However, epio longitude and latitude
Come easy with the aid of pompous platitude.
The Art of Arts is that of Spinning Out,
And Genius is a Spider. Conversation
Ad libitum all sorts of things about,
Shows one's encyclopedic information,
And oovers paper. Edoar Foe, no doubt,
Would have demurred, but my interpretation
Of a Great Poem that shall outlive Time,
Is—a Colossal Rigmarole in Rhyme.
Beevob was—Beevob, in his own regard
And that of Edelweiss; but who was he
To Gbetchen P There's the crux; 'tis there tbe Bard
Perceives the promise and the potency
Of sentiment and small talk by the yard.
Gretchen was pledged as fast as fast could be
To Pumpernickel. Would she marry Beevob.
When she found out he was an Aroh-Deoeiver?
Lone Geetcken's oreed was Love Predestined; her
Faith was in Germany! (Line-endings jerky
Are not mellifluous, but they will occur.)
Some may regard the Teuton mind as murky,
The Teuton manners prickly as a burr,
The Teuton spirit less sublime than perky;
But Gbetchen looked upon the German soul
As honour's home, love's nest, and wisdom's goal.
With such a faith, how should she stoop to wed
A mere Fitzdotterel? O'er this problem fumbling
Beevob went very nearly off his head.
His fix indeed was tight, and rather humbling.
"FrrzDOTTEBEL, Keep your Pecker up!" So said
Old Edelweiss. "You're wrong ""Oh, bother
grumbling!"
Broke in the youth. "You know I'm not a German,
Whilst Gbetchen thinks I am, and calls me Hermann!"
"Her man you are, her man of men indeed,"
Chuckled pun-loving old Polonies, winking.
"By Jove !" shrieked Beevob, "so I am! I read
Fate's fiat in the faot I! Hoch! no more shrinking!
That omen tells me I shall yet succeed.
Bless you, my Edelweiss 1!!" Here Beevob, sinking
Upon his knees, clasped the old pedant's pants,
And wept all over them. (A Muse that cants,
A Man that blubbers, and a Maid that gushes,
Form the old popular Bnlwiggian triad.)
Lone Gbetchen was all babblement and blushes;
Pensive and pale at times as a lost Pleiad.
Her talk was lavish as Lodore's wild rushes.
Beevob discovered her, like a fair Dryad,
Lolling beneath the statue of a Faun,
Midst clumps of boskage and soft slopes of lawn.
She saw that he was troubled, by his nose
Still pink with weeping,—such was her capacity
For Sympathetic Intuition I Those
Who have this super-subtle fine sagacity
Alone may understand the marvel. Close
She clung to him, and strove, with sweet tenacity,
To cheer him up. Whatever was the matter
She knew he could be comforted with chatter.
She talked,—oh! how she talked! A treatise long
On Transcendental Love {we HI leave out that),
A Mystic Legend (Jet that elide .'), a Song,
{No matter.') Several reams of Roundabout,
She plied him with. "Hebmann," she oried, " you 're wrong
My powers of consolation still to doubt.
I knotc you,—even better than I love I"
"Oh, murder!" Beevob moaned; "do you, by Jove?
"Why, if you did, you'd turn me up—bohoo!—
Just as the old Dame's dog did!" "Foolish, elf!"
Low gurgled Gbetchen, "was it not for you
I gave up Twenty Millions—all my pelf?"
"No!" thundered Beevob, "No! It's all a Do I
For Gbetchen, Gbetchen, I am not myself,
But some one else! There, it's all out! I'll show it"
"Shut up, you silly goose!" cried she. "J know it!"
Silence! You might have heard tradition's pin
Drop on the tear-soaked turf. Then his Egeria
Began again. He listened with a grin,
Which, half was happiness and half hysteria.
Mystic as Coleridge's Geraldine,
And masterful as Baizac's Belle Impiria.
She looked, low-bending o'er that moon-struok "swimmy" 'un,
As chaste Diana stooped o'er dazed Endtmion.
"How did you find it out ?" he murmured. "Why,"
Said she, "you 've given proofs in vast variety,
That you are one beside yourself. Do try
To be less babyish; it breeds satiety.
De plus, I am a great Clairvoyante, 1,
A member of the Psyohioal Society,
An Esoterio Buddhist, half a Yankee.
And—need you further proofs?" Cried he, "No, thankee!
"Yet, oh my Sibyl! tell me yet one other
Thing. Who am It" "Nay, there oooksureness shrinks
Not e'en Koot-Hoomi, the great Thibet' Brother,'
Could play the CEdipus to such a Sphinx.
. You may be ' Whioh,' you may again be, 'T 'Other,'"
She answered, with the pleasantest of winks.
But on the Vocative why longer brood?
You 're just a psychical Subjunctive Mood—
"The incarnation of a mystio May-Be!"
"Hooray!" yelled Beevob. "All at last is well!
Hegel was but a metaphysio baby
Compared with you. What matter, oh, ma belle,
Whether I be a low-born German gaby,
Or Unfitzdotterelled Fitzdotterel?
Being and Not-Being are all the same,
And Metamorphio Muddle wins the game!"
• •••••
They Lived, they Loved, they Lucubrated on,
These twain, with Edelweiss for minor third.
Gbetchen ignored her Twenty Millions flown,
Beevob resigned his Earldom like a bird.
Love's the true Transcendental Polygon.
(This means a lot, though it may sound absurd.)
As Tillers of the Soil they sought sweet offioes,
Thus end—with a bad rhyme—their metamorphoses 1
But oh to hear them perorate!! I Their lives
Were one long miscellaneous Disquisition.
Gbetchen, the most magniloquent of wives,
Facile princeps, kept the first position
As Twaddler-General. Manacles and gyves
Would not hold guests there on the dread condition
Of listening whilst they prosed with flat facility
On Love and Territorial Nobility.
Just as a specimen I '11 here append
Some fifty staggering stanzas—{No you don't!
It's high time this long rigmarole should end.)
What more, 0 Muse P (It is the Singer's wont
To wind up thus.) Ere I lay down my pen
The Reader may demand—I've not yet shown't—
The due to this long labyrinth Anglo-German,
Fitzd ottebel-Pumpebnickel-Beevob- Hebmann 1
Who was Fitzdotterel then? Ah I there's the crux,
Why even Gbetchen's powers of divination
Failed thereupon to throw their fiat lux!
She vaguely talked of "Nature's Usurpation,"

SORROWS OF A METROPOLITAN CANDIDATE.
Only a month, a
little month, has
passed sinoe I had
the distinguished
honour of being se-
lected by the Liberal
and Radioal Associa-
tion of my Parlia-
mentary District as
their Candidate at the
approaching General
Election, and yet the
enormous amount of
absurd, and imperti-
nent, and wearying,
and worrying corre-
spondence I have had
to endure, and not
only to endure, but to
endure without a murmur, and even with an appearance of thankful-
ness, is simply incredible. My table groans with awful piles of
letters, and such letters! Nothing is too great or too small for my
merciless persecutors. Am I in favour of a Republic P "Should
not the Poor-Law Guardians have power to raise the Beadle's wages
without asking permission of an 'aughty Aristocracy P" Should the
House of Lords be abolished P If not, why not? and if so, how P
How was I to answer this puzzle satisfactorily P It took me nearly
two hours to concoct an answer, and even then the only reply I got
was that my opinions on this crucial question were very unsound,
and would require much re-consideration.
As to Disestablishment and Disendowment, was I opposed to one,
or both, or neither J1 If to one.which? If to neither, why? If to
both, what would I say to dividing the proceeds among poor trades
men, ruined by the wicked Stores, in proportion to the number of
the family, he being the proud parent of eight?
As to Emigration, which particular Colony would I recommend for
a fine strapping son aged two-and-twenty, and why, and the pro-
bable oost, and the means of supporting him until something eligible
turned up P Could I possibly have any objection to stand godfather
to a sweet blooming cherub, only six weeks old, who was to be named
after me P
"Was I aware of the startling faot that while one shilling's-worth of
the Poor Man's tea paid a tax of eightpenoe, that a shilling's-worth
of the Bloated Aristocrat's ohampagne paid a tax of only one half-
penny P If so, what did. I think of it, and how should I proceed
to remedy that gross iniquity when returned to Parliament r Had
I fully considered the question of Fair Trade, and with what result
as regarded a diseased neighbour's cattle P
An Irish Eleotor who says that he represents nearly four hundred
of 'the same class, asks me to state in plain and unmistakeable
language whether I will support that eminent Patriot, Mr. Paknkix,
in his endeavour to obtain Justice for bis down-trodden country, and
better wages for his oppressed countrymen; while a Member of the
local Vestry would like to know my views upon the future Govern-
ment of the Metropolis.
These are but a sample of the various matters I am expected to
expound, in lengthy epistles, and to the accomplishment of which
task I have devoted every hour of my usual August holiday, and with,
I fear, but very moderate success, judging by the unsatisfied tone of
the various comments I receive from my numerous correspondents.
I am worn out with my inoessant work—to me, too, of an especially
disagreeable, beoause an unusual character—1 am ill and dispirited
and very doubtful of ultimate success, and despite the cheery tones
in which my guide, philosopher, and agent, still addresses me, I am
fain to confess that I look back with bitter, regret to the day when I
madly allowed myself to
be announced as a Candi-
date for Parliamentary
honours, and nothing but
the fear of the biting sar-
casm of my foes, and the
still more terrible sympa-
thising pity of my nume-
rous friends, prevent me
from at once announcing
my retirement from a
position that has been,
and still is, a most un-
mitigated nuisance and
almost unbearable bore, and then flying joyously away on the wings
of an express train and express Boat to Venice or Egypt or Jericho,
—anywhere, anywhere, out of the world " of Politics?'

The Strict J. P.
Those who are apt to sneer at the uselessness of the Great Unpaid,
will read the following extraot from the Daily Telegraph with great
pleasure:—
"Two lads under ten years of age were ordered to be flogged by the
Bamsley Magistrates yesterday, for stealing a horse value £40."
Whether a chastisement by Justioes of the Peace would be more
effective than the birch-rod well laid on by an experienced gaoler,
we are unable to say. Possibly the Barnaley Magistrates are
peculiarly skilful in this kind of punishment; but, if there are
many naughty boys in Barnaley, it strikes us that the life of a
J. P. in that busy town will be anything but a happy one.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.
IT.—From an Amateur Ambassador.
Stamboul, Monday.

ear Tobt,
How is London looking
j ust now? Have you a blue
sky overhead? do you
breathe soft summer airs?
and can you from your
palace windows look out
upon the Bosphorus. I
trow not, and, thinking of
you and your gloomy
autumnal surroundings, I
am all the more pleased
with the decision I took.
Of course, I might have
had some offioe at home,
and it was naturally ex-
pected that I should take
one. But I thought better
of it, and have never since regretted the decision. Supposing I had been Under
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, or something at the Local Government Board,
what would have happened? I'd have had all the drudgery of the offioe, and
just when I had begun to master the details, and another quarter's salary came
due, we would be all bundled out. But see what I get now. A trip to the East
with the pleaaantest time of the year coming on; am styled his Excellency; am
received with more or less distinction at the various Courts; have the newspapers
chronicling my movements and making all kinds of gueBBes of things that never
happen. Then I arrive here and a nigh old time I; am having of it / can
tell you.
The only drawback to the pleasure of the excursion hitherto has been
B-sm-rck's grumpiness. "If it suits S-l-sb-rt's game, or is one of his neces-
sities, to find a little excursion for you, that's his affair," taid the Chanoellor
when I called on him. "But really you must excuse me. I'm a man of
business, with enough serious work on hand to occupy me, and can't join you in
playing at diplomacy." That's his way, and we must put up with it. For the
rest, they behaved nobly. Not a wink or a smile that I have seen, but everyone
making-believe that the Mission has serious bearings upon international politics.
Bat the crowning delight of the excursion, so far as it has gone, is the conduct
of the S-lt-n. He's really nice. To external view things are conducted with
most impressive ceremony. There are preliminary meetings with Ministers,
audiences fixed, and, when the time comes, we sit together by the hour, smoking
and drinking sherbet (which I detest), and only now and then, as it were,
breaking the silence by a wink. The other day, to make the thing look more
real, the S-lt-n kept me waiting an hour. I confess I thought that was oarrying
the actuality a little too far. It was particularly awkward for me, for, if you
remember, I kicked up an awful shine in the House, when, during the negotia-
tions with Russia on the Afghan business, Sir Edward Thornton was kept
twenty minutes in the ante-room of the Russian Minister. Some fellow's sure
to remember that, and it would be awkward if my speech on the occasion should
be quoted. However, the S-lt-n is such a capital fellow that it is impossible to
be angry with him for many minutes. He says he won't do it again, and thought
it would keep up appearances.
You '11 read in the newspapers, from time to time, accounts of my interviews
with the S-lt-n. But I see him a gTeat deal oftener than that. At the seoond

"Blow me tight, if I don't!" (His English is singularly idiomatic.) So it was
arranged/and after dinner the other night we went off, carefully disguised, and
I send you a little sketch
spent a very pleasant evening,
of our appearance.
I had a letter the other day from the Mar kiss, in which
he says that we must really hasten up, and look as if we
were doing something. I showed this to the 8-lt-n.
But he won't hear of it. "No, Lord W-lff," his Majesty
was pleased to say. "For the first time in my life I am
enjoying the Eastern Question. If you get this business
concluded, you '11 go, and I will be desolate. We will go
on as before, and you shall send for the Lord Corxhill,
and we '11 show him round."
It's all very pleasant, and I'm certainly in no haste to
leave. But I am bound to go on to Cairo, where it will
be a little flat after this, and then I must get home in
time for my electoral campaign. Pleasure's all very well,
and, with a jolly good fellow like the S-lt-n, one makes
the most of it. But business must also be attended to.
So you '11 have me back again shortly, dear Tobt; and,
in tne meantime. I remain,
Yours, faithfully, H. D. W-lff.

We 're facing roughish weather;

"FREE" EVERYTHING.
July 1.—Off to Scarborough. Delightful plan this, Parliament
establishing " State-aided Holiday Trips," and forbidding Employers
to keep their servants in town during summer months. Quite worth
having Ch-mb-rl-n as Prime Minister when he givesus an "Emanci-
pation of Toilers' Act " about once a Session.
July 3.—At Scarborough. "Free Railway Journeys" as well as
"Free Holiday Trips." Scrumptious! Landladies'here don't stem
quite to.like the " Free Lodging " plan, it's true; and in fact, most
of 'em have been ruined and have left the place. Consequence is,
visitors have to make their own beds, and cook their own food, as it's
illegal to bring one's own servants with one in July. Vide " Emanci-
pation of Toilers' Act," as before.
July 5.—Jolly yachting excursion arranged for to-day. Wonder
how it'll come off. Cn-MB-RL-a's Act for "Nationalisation of
Yachts " gives me right to go and seize any vessel in harbour that I
like. But then it also gives everybody else same right, so I have to
get up uncommonly early to be first down at the beaoh. Sinoe the
Act, too, owners of yachts have generally anchored out at sea. and
fired on any boats that come within a hundred yards of than. Don't
want to be fired at, but do want a yacht.
July 6.—Nearly drowned yesterday! Yacht (I got one by luck)
leaked abominably. Nobody's interest, now, to repair it. When
about an hour from shore, found it sinking I Shouted to fisherman
close by to "come and Bave me." Fisherman shouted back that he'd
have me up under "Emancipation of Toilers' Act" if I tried to
employ him in July! Finally, had to give him five pounds and pro-
raise not to tell anybody about it, and he took me off. Query—Was
this compounding a felony t Also, doesn't Ch-mb-rl-n's " Emanci-
eation of Toilers Aot" let in water somewhere? Don't know what
eoame of Yacht, and don't care.
July 15.—Rather tired of Holidays. Not well. Arises partly, I
think, from "Free Tobacco Act." Tobacconists now paid a fixed
salary, and supply cigars, &c, gratis to anybody who wants 'em.
Result is that they keep nothing but coarsest shag and stalest weeds.
Also " no servants" system fatiguing. Tried to make Tommy (my
youngest boy) help me in family bed-making yesterday. Tommy
refused. He said Mr. Chimblyblain's Act of Parliament didn't
allow it, and he'd run me in if I didn't take care!" Query— Is this
one of the " infant liberties" that I 've read about? This spread of
democratic sentiments can only, I think, be remedied by a "Free
Birohes" Bill being introduced.
July 28.—Staggered to-day by receiving demand for no end of
rates and taxes! Collector says "it's to pay for freeing everything
by Hact of Parlymint." Somehow I thought I was free from
taxes altogether. Glad to say Tommy was taken up yesterday for
stealing a bucket and spade belonging to another boy on the beach.
Tommy said " he thought Mr. Chimblyblain's Act had made spades
and buckles free." Not a bit of it. Magistrate ordertd him a birch-
ing—really pleased. Tommy says "it's a jolly shame;" only he
doesn't quite understand the princifles of recent democratic legis-
lation.
August.—Tommy unbearable—packed him off to Eton—which is
now, of course, a "Free School" under the recently passed "Free
(Secondary) Education Act."
September.—Back in Town. Holiday over, thank heaven! Done
up—also hard up. Hurrah !—salary-day near. Must go down and
draw my salary, as I found those sea-tide rates and taxes quite as
stiff as old lodging-house charges.
At Office.—Horrors! Polite intimation from my employer that as
"Emancipation of Toilers' Aot" precludes him from giving me
employment during summer months, he feels it would be quite con-
trary to the spirit of the enactment if he were to offer me any salary
for the same period, but that he hopes in October that I may resume
my duties, and &c, &c."
Only question now is, Shall 1 go in for taking advantage of
"Free Emigrants' Passages Act," or "Free Bankruptcy Certificate
Act P" Do latter, and rather concur in Tommy's depreciatory view
of " Free" Eton, Yachts, Tobacco, Holidays, and all the rest of it.
Living upon Land.—Given to the Agricultural Labourer, Land
to oultivate without any Capital, what will he have to lat? Dirt.

of the main thoroughfare, and go down some quiet street for dinner.

cook on board, who, I believe, is considered as one of the crew, and
lends a hand in that capacity when required. In his line he is a
cordon bleu, or a Captain Cook. And this leads me to inquire how, in
nautical phraseology, "the son of a sea-cook" ever came to be a
term of opprobrium. It may not be so nowadays, but it certainly
was so in the days of Captain Maebtatt, whose Novels are, I see.
being re-issued at oheap prices. In this author's time, when one naval
gentleman wished to insult another naval gentleman, he spoke of him
as "the son of a sea-cook." Now, the more I have seen of sea-cooks,
the more inexplicable has this term seemed to me. Take our present
admirable artist, for example. His appearance on deck—where his
visits are as those of angels, few, and far between—the simile being
rendered all the more forcible from his being clothed from head to
foot in white,—strikes me with a sort of awe, that is, when you see
him legs and all, for, as a rule, when he ordinarily comes to the
surface—for air, I suppose—he rises from a sort of open trap-door,
and shows merely his head and shoulders, like one of the apparitions
in the witches' cauldron, and then, after taking in a supply of ozone,
he descends once more to his work in his rather limited kitchen,
where, as it appears to me, the stove is not half the size of the joint
which has to oe served. The sea-cook is evidently looked up to by
the crew, and is treated, as I can note, with profound respect. Ex
uno disce omnes sea-cooks, or is this one the exception? In fact if,
after the Captain, there is one person who is more deferentially
treated than another it is the sea-oook. And if sea-cook pere is so
eminently respectable, why should it be a reproach to anyone to be
the son of such a parent P Is it possible that the sea-oook is, after
all, only a whitea sepulchre P No, never 1 tell that, among other
absurdities, to the marines.
It is lovely weather, and Collins the Composer is full of inspira-
tion. Fresh inspirations are brought by every breeze; we can almost
see them coming, and the Composer catching them. The proximity
of the Irish coast suggests to him a cantata on the Union of the
three countries, to include a seleotion of the most popular national
melodies. Mackraoken Bay, or whatever was the name of the tran-
quil spot where we anchored for dinner last night, and which we
quit ted early this morning ere we were out of our comfortable berths,
has also suggested a romantic ballad to him. He says it ought to
begin with something mysterious, and some words like—
"'Twae in Maokracien Bay
All night the (something) lay."
And what next P Being in a lazy mood after breakfast, our host
supplies a line—
"And in the morn we were under weigh,"
which has the merit of being strictly trne, though the Composer
scorns it. Then, from its not having been seized at the moment, the
inspiration evaporates, and the Composer sits listlessly in his easy-
chair, gazing at the islands and the islets, until he hears the quacking
of a sea-bird, when he wants to shoot at it, wherever it is.
The sea-birds are perfectly indifferent to being shot at by us.
They know as well as we do that we only wish to show how near we
oan go without hitting them. We should all be most unhappy
should anyone of the party hurt a sea-bird, as we can't stop to piok
it up, and if we could it would be of no use to us either for eating,
stuffing, or selling.
On the whole, when we feel that we must shoot—for there are
moments on board a yaoht when you do begin to be absolutely
fatigued with the exertion of sitting still ana doing nothing—we
prefer bottles to birds by way of targets; and as perpetual pop-
ping is apt to result in headache, the necessity for doing something
being strong upon us, we put down the rifle ana paoe the deck sharply
up and down, jocosely at first, saluting one another with good-
natured nods, just as people meeting on the same promenade at a sea-
side resort are accustomed to do, until, in default of not knowing
exaotly what etiquette requires of you on passing a person for the
tenth time in the course of three-quarters of an hour, eaoh looks
another way directly they spy eaoh other coming, and at last they
cut one another dead, with a glassy and even contemptuous stare,
which says as plainly as words could," Confound the fellow I what's
he doing here still r Why on earth can't he go away, and let me
walk up and down without meeting him t" And the mention of this
reoalls to my mind a very comic scene, supposed to take plaoe at
Brighton, whioh was given years ago by Messrs. Edktod Yates and
Harold Power at the Egyptian Hall. We are repeating that episode
on deck now, only without an audience.
So we invent dodgy walks, in and out round the skylights, and
avoid one another until we feel sociable, then we make as many varia-
tions of companionship in promenading as our number will permit.
Foed-Bahly prefers sitting down until the Captain gives some word
of command, when, being a thorough sailor and up in all the mysterious
workings of the ship, he suddenly jumps up, rushes at a rope, and is
seen nunling at it hand over hand, as if his life, and the lives of all
on board depended solely on his dexterity and presence of mind at
this trying orisis; and he goes on sternly and manfully grappling with
it long after the orew have done their work, whatever it was, until
a quiet old sailor comes up, nods to him pleasantly in a humouring,
patronising sort of way, and taking the rope out of his hand, fixes it
somewhere with a twist, and retires tothefo'csle, whereupon Bauly.
with the modest air of a man who is oonsoious of having deserved well
of his oountry, but is disinclined to urge his olaims, resumes his seat
without a word, and betakes himself to examining the coast, through
his race-glasses as if nothing extraordinary had happened; but all
the time seeming to say to us land-lubbers, Look here! it is of stuff
like this that the British Tar is made.''
We are passing more islands. No one apparently on any of them.
Occasionally a small house. Who lives there? How did he get
there? How will he ever get away from there? Do they ever see
the papers? I can observe no signs of cultivation. I see no boats.
Now and then during the day we catch a glimpse of a large house,
most picturesquely situated, evidently belonging to some very rioh
person; for only two classes could possibly reside here, the very rioh
who can get away, and the very poor who can't.
Revolutions might happen in England, or in Sootland for the
matter of that, and the residents in these out-of-the-way islands—if
there are any residents—would never be any the wiser, as, probably,
they would he none the better, for communication with the inner
world. I am not speaking of course of plaoes evidently near such
centres of civilisation as Oban, Tobermory, and so forth, but of the
wild islands which have names (who gave them ?) and local habita-
tions (who live in them P—Robinson Crusoes and M'Fridays ?), and
which, when carefully searched for, can be found in the sea-chart,
and are known only by sight to mariners, who, however, have never
had the curiosity to land and make further inquiries.
All this is old to us; and Culliss, who has had no inspi-
ration since lunch at 1'80, confides to me at 4 p.x. that he yearns
for something new. He longs to sail away, somewhere, where he
hasn't been, to see something he has never seen, and do lots of things
he has never done. These are, as I recognise, the aspirations of
GeniuB. He repeats these hints to Foed-Bamly. But Bakly has
been everywhere, and Been everything. To him mere sailing is the
purest enjoyment. He loves the sea, he loves sailing for sailing's
sake; he loves ships and shipping, he has all nautical phrases at his
fingers' ends, and can splice a main-brace, or make taut whatever
has to be made taut—for here my powers of description fail me—and
oan twist ropes into all sorts of elegant shapes, specially priding
himself on some peculiar sort of sailor's knot, and on trimming
and plaiting a rope's end in a decorative fashion, somewhat similar
to the manner in which farmers do up the horses' tails when they
are taken to a show. So Foed-Baklt doesn't care where he goes as
long as the ship sails, and he's in it.
For my part, when, after dinner, the subjeot is broached, and our
host politely inquires, "Where we fellows would like to go P " I am
ready to leave the matter in his hands, and so is Cdxltns the Com-
poser, on the understanding, whioh constitutes a sort of clause in the
agreement made and provided, that we go somewhere fresh to us, and
where he (Culllns) has not been before.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Nautical Kei'Artee.
"Shall I lend you a hand t" "No; but if you
don't move, I can give you a tow."
"How about Stafia and Iona f" asks our host.
Of all places the ones I, personally, should have selected. Yes, the
Composer, too, brightens up at the mention of Staff a and Iona. He
adds, looking round at our host inquiringly, "And Fingal's Cave,
eh?" Whereupon our host replies, Of course."
Already the Composer sees a oantata, or an Oratorio, on Staffa and
Iona; though it suddenly occurs to him that "Fingal's Caye" has
already been done.
However, we are unanimous for Staffa and Iona, and, indeed, we all
become enthusiastic on the subject—all, that is, except Ford-Bamly,
who is never visibly enthusiastic about anything. _ He has been out
yaohting and voyaging about for the greater part of his life, is as hardy
as an ancient Norseman, as bronzed as a veteran mariner ought to be.
and, as he is credited
with possessing an
inexhaustible fund
of nautical experi-
ence, we listen to
him with that defer-
ence to his opinion
which the authority
of such a navigating
Nestor ought to
command. For my
Eart, now that we
ave settled on
Staffa and Iona, it
seems that the one
ohief object, of my
life, up to this time,
has been to see these
two celebrated
places. I know little more of them, except from photographs, than
Columbus did of America before he discovered it.
If I were asked, off-hand, to give my notion of Staffa and Iona, I
should say—under correction of anyone who had been .there—that
they were two weird islands whose grim basaltic rocks rose to a
gigantic height above the sea, while their wild and awful aspect
seemed to menace with dire vengeance the approach of the ten ~
rations sailor.
Huge caverns there must be, where strange marine monsters lurk;
here is the home of the sea-serpent in wet weather, and as to water-
fiends, storm-goblins, and amphibious demons, I should say that Staffa
and Iona are their nocturnal play-ground, with a submarine commu-
nication between the two islands. Then as to Fingal's Cave—what
do I picture it P A gigantio Basaltic Cavern piercing the Island
(whether Staffa or Iona I am not certain) for miles in every direction;
where, at the entrance, the fierce waves are roaring like Lions
guarding the Giant's Gates, which, being once passed, the adventurous
traveller becoming gradually accustomed to the dim light, will come
upon placid silver lakes, caverns within caverns, oaves within caves,
may even see Sirens and Water-nymphs—will mark the silver-fish
darting hither and thither in the deep blue waters, while after
passing along another basaltic gallery, flambeaux will be lighted
by the guides, and he will enter the Stalactite Hall which is called
"Fingal's Refectory," and crossing this will be shown another
cavern, glowing with red sandstone called "Fingal's Kitchen," and
so on to his Stables, and then out by Fingal's Backdoor, where the
Sea-Lions are again roaring, and where the visitor is suddenly
blinded by the glare of daylight, and thanks Heaven that he once
more basks in the glorious sunlight.
The above, off-hand, is my idea of Fingal's Cave, which, I fancy,
commences in Staffa and finishes in Iona, or vice vertd. I regret
that we can't sail right through it in the yacht; but, as it is a one-
hundred-and-forty tenner, this is evidently impossible. Still, to go
as near as we can to that grand solitude, with none but the wild
sea-birds for our companions The Composer interrupts, and
exclaims, "It will indeed be grand!" He sees violoncello passages
all through Staffa and Iona, with drum and ophicleide, and cymbals.
Ford-Bamly, in his most genial and always nautical manner,
shakes his head pleasantly. It is very difficult landing," he says;
"in fact, if it is at all rough, we shall not be able to go ashore.
Awkward place," he continues, cheerfully, filling his pipe and
smiling pleasantly all round, "very awkward place. Not a year
but there are some lives lost in landing."
The Composer and myself regard one another with curious interest.
Our host, who has been on deck for a few minutes to make some
inquiries of the Captain, now returns, takes his seat at the head of
the council-table, and having assumed his pince-nez with an air of
conducting the most searching inquiry into what has been going on
during his absence, listens attentively to the words of experience
that are falling from the lips of the great navigator, Ford-Bamly,
who, however, only repeats for Melleyille's benefit, his opinion,
with additional'force and increased geniality as to the dangers of
landing at Staffa, or Iona: and then further exhilarates us by giving
us a few cheerful stories of Atlantic swells having quite unexpectedly,
and with no sort of intimation from any fore-cast whatever, taken
harmless explorers quite unawares, and on the most lovely days, when
the sun was shining and all nature was rejoicing in full summer time,
swept yachts, boats, and sailors right away, temporarily swamped
Staffa and Iona, choked up Fingal's Cave, and drowned everybody
generally in a sort of localised Universal Deluge. Of all this Ford-
Bamly delivers himself with winks, nods, and smiles, in the cheeriest
possible manner, as if he alone had escaped to tell the tale, and
simply considered himself rather luoky, and that was all.
"But if going to Staffa and Iona is so dangerous, what awful risks
photographers must run!" This I put by.way of argument, to show
that Ford-Bamly may possibly be mistaken. The argument, I am
aware, is not absolutely convincing, and Ford-Bamly only shrugs his
shoulders and smiles, as much as to say, "My dear fellow, no one
can answer for what a photographer will do."
Our host here drops his pince-nez, and observes, quietly, "Of
course we are not going there in the yacht."
This falls like a thunderbolt on the Composer and myself. I
acquiesce silently, but Cullins the Impetuous almost jumps off the
sofa.
"Not in the yaoht I" he ories. "Then how"
"By steamer," Melletille informs him, and then adds—
"I've just been consulting the Captain, and I find there's a
steamer, The Chevalier it is called, which starts every morning at
eight, and takes people for the day's excursion."
The romance of Staffa, Iona, and Fingal's Cave has all suddenly
vanished, and we, the gay Yachtsmen, the bold explorers, the
undaunted sailors, with our own vessel and our own crew,—that is,
our host's, but the effect is the same to outsiders,—we are to become
to-morrow mere Steamer Excursionists, taken with Dick,", Tom,
'Abriet, and 'Abry—specially 'Abry,—at so much a-head,.toJ"do"
Staffa and Iona.
i However, it is settled, and to-morrow we start.
■ I take it philosophically; any change is a little holiday for me.
But the Composer is depressed.

From an egg as colossal as that of the Roc
Whioh astonished poor Sindbad, 'tis doubtless a shock
To see such a Chick make his exit.
But nous diplomatic seems ill-fated, very.

To baffle and bother and vex it.

0 shrewdness united of Bizzr and Dizzy!

The web of the future, how is it you leave
Fortuitous holes in its tissue P
Could a congress of ostriches scheme to combine
One huge joint-stock egg, it might look mighty fine,
But, laid in the sands and neglected,
If, in fulness of time, the egg-mountain gave birth
To a mouse-like result, moving gazers to mirth,
What more could be fairly expected P
Our protocol-spinners, what are they at best
But ostriches blind, with Fate's sands for their nest?
Their eggs how abortive and addled!

By them to be bridled and saddled.

DE LUNATICO INQUIRENDO.
Dear Mr. Punch,
The London Correspondent of the Liverpool Mercury, com-
menting on what he calls the anomalies of the Registration, says that,
among other absurdities, "lunatics have been put on, and their
keepers have been struck off." Sir, I protest. This is too hard
upon lunatics, whether in an asylum, like myself, or out, like the
majority of party politicians. The latter class of lunatics are so
numerous that if they were struck off the Register the electorate
would be small indeed. We, the small minority in the Asylums,
cannot, of course, pretend to compete in inconsequence of thought,
or fury of speech, with the vast horde of political and literary lunatics
suoh as spout on party platforms or pen party philippics for the
Evening Howler or the St. Jingo Gazette.
But I don't think our claims ought to be entirely ignored, much
less openly derided. I myself possess pronounced political opinions,
though I have no opportunity of pronouncing them. I hold, for
instance, that Mr. Gladstone is the Antichrist, that Lord Salisbury
yearns to bring about an European Armageddon, that Mr. Chamber-
lain is a mixture of Autolycus, Mob Soy, and Jeremy Diddler; that
Lord Randolph Churchill means every word he says, and that the
one sound, sage, and sober Statesman of the time—except myself—ii
Mr. Ashmead-Bartlett. I also believe that the full establishment
of Protection, the abolition of the House of Commons, the Munici-
palisation of the Land, the three F's—Free Education, Free Feeding,
and Free Clothing—will bring baok the Arcadian Age of Gold by
leaps and bounds. But, bless you, if these select and moderate views
are to incapacitate me for possessing a vote, where, in the name of
that rampant rabies called Party Spirit, are you to find your pro-
perly qualified voters P I pause for a reply. Remaining
Yours indignantly,
Poor Tom.

As theme for indignant apostrophe. Here I
A tuppeny outsider wet, and so weary,
Bit huddled in horrid discomfort. 0 life bored
You are not worth living, upon a damp " knifeboard."
The seat has no cushions, 'tis reekingly damp,
The East wind is playing wild tricks with my Gamp.
No waterproof apron at all is provided,
My humble petition for one is derided,
By him, the warm-muffled Conductor, whose mind
Seems entirely at ease whilst it's all " right behind."
I sit in a stream with my feet in a flood,
A rill down my spine is congealing my blood.
No comfort, no shelter. Complaint is but "fuss,"
"When it comes from a Clerk on a Tuppeny 'Bus!
I am not a poet, but oh, that some bard
Would take up my case, which is certainly hard;
Would wake up the Company, get me redress,

Prettt Pickings. — One day last week the Hop-
pickers on the Duke of Edinburgh's grounds refused to
take a shilling a basket for their pickings, and all went
up in a body to interview His Koyal Highness. "How
much are my neighbours giving? asks H.R.H. "One
and threepence a basket," reply the pickers. "Then,"
says n.R.H., " I'll give you one-and-sixpence a basket!"
Whereat there was great cheering and singing of " God
Save the Queen." Now this was very generous, impul-
sively generous, on the part of our musical and Hop-erratic
Prince. But was it quite doing to his neighbours what he
would wish his neighbours to do to him? Woa't his neigh-
bours have to give one-and-sixpence per basket? And
who are his neighbours? Can they afford to be Princely
too? or are they dependent on a good hop-year to recoup
them tor previous losses r These questions they '11 settle
among themselves in that part of the country, but as far
as the generous impulse goes, "Bravo Dook 1"
QUID PRO QUO;
Or, the Coming Railway Report— according to Mr. Suthersl.
The half-yearly Meeting of the General British Railway Company
was held yesterday, the Chairman presiding. He said that in moving
the adoption of the Report he had, in the first place, to congratulate
the Shareholders on the rigid economy that had been practised in the
working department, an economy that did oredit to all concerned in
the management of the line, from the General Traffic Manager down
to the most subordinate official. He was proud to say that they had
got, on an average, a good working week of 115 hours out of their
men all round, and though there had been some complaining, and a
break-down here and there, the whole result had been eminently
satisfactory. The system of keeping one driver on his engine for
twenty-five hours at a stretch, and or sending a guard hack straight
off on a fifteen hours' return journey, had been found to work effi-
ciently; and though some signalmen had protested on not being
relieved for nineteen hours and a half, and in one or two instances
had alleged that they were not able to totter to their posts and con-
tinue their labours, yet their prompt and instant dismissal had had a
salutary effeot, and no more insubordination of this kind was likely
to be encountered in future. The savin? in expenditure under this
head had been therefore a matter for decided congratulation.
He regretted, however, that the rest of the Report could hardly be
described as couleur de rose. The serious accidents that had marked
the half-year's proceedings, and he wished it to be understood that he
used that word " serious" in reference to the damaging effect on the
Company's receipts, had had, he regretted to own it, a depressing
effeot on their financial interests. It had been urged in some
Suarters, that these accidents had been entirely due to the failure of
ie Company's servants, who had broken down under undue pressure
and over-strain. He thought not, and he might add that his brother
Directors were of the same cheerful opinion. Still, the heavy amounts
paid away in compensation for life and limb were not to be ignored,
and the fact that the whole of the dividend, not only on the ordinary,
but also on the preference and the debenture stock of the Company
had been totally absorbed in meeting the olaims against them, must
be regarded as unsatisfactory. He, however, recommended the adop-
tion of the Report, and only trusted that they might have " better
luck next time." This announcement, together with the declaration
of no dividend, appeared fairly to stun the meeting, and was received
with indescribable uproar, which, owing to the fact that the Chair-
man and the Directors were chased several times round the platform
by an indignant gang of Shareholders, had not subsided when our
Reporter left.

THE BLACK BOARD.
A Fragment of Unexplained Metropolitan Romance.
"The matters at issue are of a kind -which no public body can venture to
leave unnoticed. The Board is charged with wilful complicity in a disregard
of its own sanitary rules, and with a downright fraud besides, or, in the alter-
native, with conducting its business in so muddled a fashion as to deprive it
of all claim to confidence."—Times.'
The two figures emerged from the gloom, and sped on their way
down the newly-construoted thoroughfare. They paused opposite a
large but dilapidated public-house that stood alone, as if insolently
defying the levelling prooess that had destroyed all the neighbouring
buildings. The foremost spoke. "And this is one?" he asked of
his companion. A hoarse laugh of assent was his reply, but he
understood its meaning, and, after a pause, approached the flaring
side-door of the premises. There was a low parley in a smothered
undertone with the landlord, broken only by the chink of gold, and
then the two moved on again. "It is something to be a member of
the Metropolitan Board of Works," continued the first speaker.
"Ha! ha f These foul rookeries pay handsomely for their footing!"
And he fingered the loose coin in his great-ooat pockets till its ring
rattled across the deserted site of the new street.
• *••••
They were superintending the laying of obsolete granite pavement
now. The younger speaker had a sinister look in his eye as he
watched, the costly and: futile process. Then he broke silence—
"' Bloomsbury ' has asked in the Times" he cried, " whether any
large contract for granite, in which any member of the Board is
direotly or indireotly interested, has anything to do with this vexa-
tious and wasteful procedure. How can we answer that? Ha 1 ha!
right merrily, enough I warrant me I" There was a malicious
subacid tone in his voioe. His companion responded by a long, low,
wicked laugh, and the too moved moodily away towards Marylebone.
• •••*•
They have reached a black alley now. A noisome stench hangs
heavily upon the oppressive atmosphere, but they push on. A house
condemned as uninhabitable by the local Vestry is rotting in the
poisoned precincts with a padlock on its door. A second has been con-
demned and is partially destroyed, but the third still stands. This
they approach. They nalt on the threshold. "A pretty bit of pro-
perty this," remarks the foremost, with grim humour, "but it is
sweeter work, I oan tell you, fingering your money than collecting it.
Bah 1 but I must in and face it 1" And so saying, at the same time
muffling himself up with a huge comforter as a protection against the
putrid miasma that meets him on the door-step, he staggers through
the portal and enters the house. The other looks after him, and
then casts an inquiring glance up at the tottering premises. "Hum,"
he growls, "and that rotten place holds fifty inmates does it? Well
I'm blest! However, he knows what he's about - he does, and so."
and here he gives an ugly chuckle, "I flatter myself does the
Board!" Then with an oath he turned towards Spring Gardens.
• *••••
Not Fur Enough.—It is being said that if we wear fur all the
year round, we shall be cooler in summer and warmer in winter.
Who suggests this? A Gentleman connected with the furrier
interest? But has he ever been due North in furrin' parts P How-
ever, the new teaching won't obtain many adherents: and as for
ourselves, we '11 have our flannels and silks in summer; and as to winter
—well, our mode of dress, then, may be in-furr'd.

SUPER-HUMAN NATURE.
Sib,—On my return to town, not having been inside a theatre,
Metropolitan, Provincial, or Continental, for the last two months—
nearer three, I fanoy—I oarefully searohed the newspaper columns
for those modest Theatrical Advertisements, which are always so diffi-
cult to find, in order to ascertain what entertainment was likely to
afford me the greatest amount of intellectual recreation. I gathered
from the first announcement whioh stood at the top of a column, in
as bold relief against the white background as the figure of Nelson
at the top of his column stands out against the clear blue sky so
familiar to Londoners, that one of your own young men had been

at Drury Lane, and was quoted as saying that " The deservedly suc-
cessful Human Nature, the best of modern melodramas, is being
played nightly to overflowing audiences." This opinion would have
been quite sufficient to decide my choice, but the statement of fact
— as to "overflowing audiences —made me hesitate.
So, after sliding down this column, and arriving at its base,
which was formed of four solid Advertisements from four different
theatres,—namely, the Grand at Islington, the Surrey, the Standard,
and, of all places, the Theatre Royal, Brighton,—I had not yet come
across anything which oould divert me from my purpose of seeing
"the best of modern melodramas."
I had not visited the Covent Garden Concerts to hear the " Fatrie
Voice* " of A. Crowe—Crows are not generally associated with fairy
voioes, and so this would be a novelty; d propos of Novelty, I had
not seen The Japt; nor, in England, had I seen the great ballet
Excelsior at Her Majesty's, whioh the Rev. Mr. Headlam, or Head
Lamb, wants his Head Shepherd, the Bishop of London, to witness,
when the event might be thus poetically recorded:—
The shades of night were falling fast,
When out from Lambeth Palace passed
A Bishop, looking clean and nice,
Who cried, I'm off where there's no vice,
"Excelsior !•'
Parson Hkadlam wants his Bishop to visit also the Alhambra. If
ao, will the Great Macdkrmott sing that jovial ditty, the chorus of
whioh ends with, "Out
of the Gladstone bag?"
Perhaps, if it has been
recently withdrawn, he
might consent to do so,
at the Rev. Mr. Head-
lam's special request.
The Vicar of Wakefield
at the Lyceum I saw
when it first came out,
so for The Mikado at the
Savoy, The Private Sec-
retary at the Globe, and
The Magistrate in his
own Court, four theatres
doing so well as to be
able to dispense, to a cer-
tain extent, with the aid
of newspaper advertise-
ments. On 'Change, at

Mr. Comyns Cask's new play at the Haymarket, Dark Days,
I must defer till November, as being more in keeping with that
month, and then, below this advertisement, I oame upon eight
paragraphs about Hoodman Blind at the Princess's Theatre. This
has been brought out in my absence (which sounds as if my permis-
sion ought first to have been obtained), and not having heard any-
thing about it, I thought I would read the " Opinions of the Press,"

which the Manager thinks it worth his while to publish, and the
oritios worth theirs to write.
"As a picturesque and romantic Actor, Mr. Wilson Barrett has
now no rival," says the autocrat " C. S." in the Illustrated London
News. How pleased Mr. W. B. must be to read this, and how nice
of "C. 8." to put aside all comparison I "His acting rose to the
altitude of genius," snouts the critic of the Observer, and then falls
baok in his chair and faints, overcome by the bare recollection of the
stupendous genius
of Mr. Wilson -r^ r~-..
Barrett. "And 1
equally notable,"
insists the critic
of the Standard,
not to be outdone
by the other gen-
tlemen, "was the
fire and passion of
his denunciation
of Lezzard, and,"
he adds, with a
burst of emotional
foroe which sends
him a long way
ahead of all his
fellow critics," the
infinite pathos of
his treatment of
the crippled
ohild." "Infinite
pathos!" This is to raise Wilson Barrett far above "the altitude
of genius," whioh was as high as the writer in the Observer could
manage to place him.
Hamlet speaks of Yorick as " a fellow of infinite jest;" but this
is quite another matter. What does this Standard writer mean?
Does he think that "infinite" means no more than "utmost,"
and that "pathos" is a synonym for "tenderness"? I would
not suppose for an instant that he oould be guilty of using " pathos"
for "passion," in the sense of " suffering " coupled with the epithet
"infinite," but will take it that, if he means anything at all, he
wishes the Publio to understand that in this scene Mr. Wilson
Barrett is a man of infinite " vehemence," or of infinite " warmth,"
or of infinite " passion," or of infinite " affection of mind," or of
infinite "energy," or of infinite "oapabilitvfor exciting the passions,"
—my authority for these interpretations being Dr. Johnson. Were
Mr. Wilson Barrett, as a matter of fact ana not by hyperbole, any
one of these, he would then be what Jeames de la Pluche was in Mary
Hann's opinion when she saw him " drest in full uniform on the day
of the levy," and exolaimed, " Ho, Jeames.' yon are no longer mor-
tial, you are diwine!" So Mary Hann, witnessing Mr. Wilson
Barrett's performance in this particular scene, and writing
"subsquintly" to the Standard, would have said, "Mortial man
never haoted so bewtifle as he did.. Ho! wot hinflnnit Day thus!
He were no longer mortial,
he were diwine." No! I
felt I was not worthy to
contemplate the perform-
ance of the object of the
Standard critic's adora-
tion, the Transcendental
Being, capable of " infinite
pathos!" So, Sir, I joined
the overflowers at Drury
Lane, and am much of
your young man's opinion
with regard to the pieee
oalled Human Nature. I
am bound, however, to say
that I think the hero a
prig, a swaggerer, and a
cid,—but then it is Human
Nature to be inconsistent.
I have my doubts as to
the legal points, but who
oares for law where Hu-
man Nature is concerned?
Thank goodness, Human
Nature has to care for Law occasionally, and obey it.
I consider the virtuous husband Mardyke very hardly used by the
Authors Messrs. Harris and Pettitt, as he must be huDg for shooting
his wife, "extenuating circumstances" not being admissible in this
country. The Trafalgar Square crowd is a masterpiece of stage-
management, the scenic changes are highly ingenious and effective,
the First Act is capitally oonstruottd, and the acting of the two
children, Frank and Dick (Miss Madd Fisher and Miss Katie
Barrt), is about as good as it can be. It was during their perform -

No one oould possibly imagine from their
"make up " that these are two villains.

With his rubbidge and roundab mtation consarnin' the Grand Old Umbrella!
Wioh there ain't ony one, and that's Saibet's, did ought to be called by that name,
And to take it in wain, like he's doin', 's a sin and a soandaludge shame!
Umbrella indeed! Why old Saibet, for many and many a year,
Mas borne hern aloft, and its flouridge has filled England's foemen with fear.
And now they would set up a rival, a bage imitashun no doubt,
Along o' that Gladstino, whose gingham we all on us hoped was wore out.
But it seems as he's got it re-covered, patched up, I persume, once again.
'Cos his lot is all out in the cold, and a shelter require from the rain.
And so the ramshackle old brolly is histed above em once more,
And they 're runnin' like rats to a 'aystack away from the pelt and the pour.
Yah! 'Brellas is 'Brellas, and Saibet's is puffick from ferrule to knob,
Wioh its ribs is as good for a " whaok" as its pint for a " prod" or a "job ;"
Oh, many's the heads it has walloped, and many's the ribs it has dug!
Whilst as shelter for me and my Party, wot can be more 'andy and snug?
As a Bword or a buckler for Bengt it flamed in the front of the fight.
He knowed its true wuth—bless his curls!—as was ever his Saibet's delight.
And now, even now—you arsk Chubchell !—that 'Brella is well to the front,
A refuge in momenks of peril, a wepping in battle's wust brunt.
And yet this young Rosebebt wenters—a nasty, howdashus young Earl!—
A newfangled rival to Saibet's Great Gingham to raige and unfurl.
Gr-r-r! next he will borrer my pattens, and claim them for Gladstino, no doubt!
Bat the Country won't be so deceived, as knows fur too well wot it's about.
That Umbrella will be a Big Failure 1 Old Saibet is cocksure of that,
Though Kosebert cling to its 'andle, and Habcoubt's new Radical hat,
All shiny, seek shelter beneath it; though Goschen and Chambebltkg jine
To praise it, the thing's a Sham-Abram, and simply not in it with Mine 1
Mine, the true Old Original Gingham, the Giant Cos
Lettuce, the 'Brella.
Not Gladsting hisself, nor that "Primrose," nor any

Can matoh it in shape, size, or colour, in power of thump
or of thrmt,

'ave never gone bust.
Woorroo! How I long for the momenk when Gingham
to Gingham we meet;
When, ribless, and pintless, and knobless, I see it lay
flop at my feet,
Asprawl like a bust-up balloon, all bedraggled and dirty

SONG OF THE SIGNALMAN.
Air—" The Young May Moon."
The rain through the night is streaming, love,
The signal lamps are gleaming, love,
I'm ast keep on the move,
Or this somnolent cove
Would soon be asleep and a-dreaming, love!
So awake!—the Express is in sight, my dear,
1 've been at it since dawning of light, my dear,
For one of the wavs
By which Railwaydom pays,
Is to keep us at work day and night, my dear I
You, and most people, now are sleeping, love,
But my watch, in my box, I am keeping, love,
For the red or green star
I must note from afar,
Though the sleep 'neath my eyelids is creeping, love.
I've been working since rise of sun, my dear,
Fourteen hours, and I'm not yet done, my dear.
Oh, to watch day and night
For the signal light
Is—Direotors think—capital fun, my dear!

deal solely with tenant-rights and cognate questions.
The marvellous dressing with which Cardinal Newmix has served
up Principal Faibbatbn on toast in this month's Contemporary, for
the delectation of the Public, is as perfect as was the sauce which
His Eminence used for cooking Mr. Gladstone's goose, Vaticanism,
and, years ago, for dishing Canon Kim.si.ky. So unjust and so reck-
less has the Cardinal proved the charges to be which were brought
against him by Principal Faibbatbn in the May Number of this
Review, that henceforth the latter had better be re-entitled "Un-
principled UnFAiBBAlBN." All the same, the Contemporary ought
to be very grateful to "Unprincipled UnFAlKBAiRw" for having
succeeded, quand meme, in "drawing" John Henbt, Cardinal

A SHORT HOLIDAY CRUISE.
Excursion to Staffa and lona—The Breakfast—The Islands—The
Cave—The Process—Sufferings-The Return—General Satis-
faction—Prospects.
A ft k ii hearing Fobd-Bamly's statement of all the dangers atten-
dant upon landing at 8taffa and Iona-[if F.-B. had been one of
William the Conqueror's advisers, the latter would never have at-
tempted to invade England]—on retiring to my berth, I consult
Murray's Guide, and after a little time, so full of horrors is this
work, with special referenoe to the Atlantic Ocean where we shall be

Sniffer and I own 'er.
to-morrow, that I close the book under the impression that the
traveller who did this journey for Murray must have been
a grim humorist. However, we are going, and to-morrow morning
we shall be ranked among the Exoumonists. While trying to re-
member whether Wordsworth's Excursion was an account of a
cheap trip to the Lake District or not, I fall asleep.
The Day.—Up early. Steward uncommonly sprightly at 6 A.M.
Evidently the prospeot of getting rid of us for a whole day's Excur-
sion is a pleasing one.
Shakspearian Mem.—" Alarums and Excursions." Ah! he was
not for an age, bnt for all time, including 6 a.m.
Everybody takes a cup of something that cheers, but does not
inebriate, which would be awkward at the commencement of our
"outing." We embark in the gig. Why called "gig " I have never
vet been informed. Whioh had the name first, the boat, or the one-
horse vehicle P Nobody in the gig can tell me. Mkllkvillk is
steering for some steps whioh he can't see, and has what the novelists
call " a strange far-on look in his eyes." He may possibly be conscious
of my question, but he doesn't reply to it, and I remember that I
must not speak to the man at the wheel. The Composer, Cullins, is
oold, and in a "don't-care " sort of humour; while Ford-Bamlt tries
to look as if he knew all about the origin of the term "gig," but I
am convinced he doesn't, and, from the expression of his countenance,
I feel sure he is making a mental note to look up the subject, and add
to his stock of nautical information on the very first available
opportunity.
We are rowed ashore and land; and then we step along the mucky
roadway—this part at Oban is invariably muoky—and go onboard the
Chevalier.
Though it is the close of the excursionist season, the steamboat is
fairly orowded. With horror I see a German band on the quay
approaching us. They are carrying their instruments of torture; but,
thank Heaven 1 they give the preference to another excursionist
steamer, going in quite a different direction from ours.
It says muoh for the,liberality, or the indifference, of the High-
landers, that they, who have their own beloved pipes, and their own
beautiful melodies (how were these ever composed for the pipes only P)
should tolerate the presence of German Musicians.
Fobs-Bamlt comes up cheerily. "Fine day," he observes, "but
blowing outside." Where did he expect it to blow? "I doubt
whether landing at Fingal's Cave will be safe to-day. Pity," he adds,
"if we can't get in, as you've never seen it—and it is worth seeing."
"Beastly hungry 1" exclaims Cullins, shrugging his shoulders,
and stamping, to get warm. It is an interesting psychological study
to note how the lower nature tyrannises even over genius. Would
an inspiration be of any possible use to the Composer at this present
moment P
I will try the experiment. I tell him what great things I expect
from Staffa and lona! I look forward to the mysterious oaves, to
the home of the wild sea-birds, to the melody of the mighty ocean,
and I ask him if he has read the beautiful description in when
suddenly a bell rings—" Breakfast, by Jove 1" shouts the Composer,
and in another second he it inextricably mixed up with a crowd of
famishing Excursionists, all struggling to be first down the com-
panion and in at the commencement of the Scotch breakfast, for
which I find the Chevalier is oelebrated, and, I may here add, justly
celebrated too.
It is simply astonishing what early rising, holiday time, Northern
Scotch marine, quite ultra-marine, atmosphere can do for a man who
"as a rule never takes breakfast." The Composer and Fokd-Bamlt
are, so to speak, professional breakfast-eaters, and therefore, given
such exhilarating and stimulating circumstances, there is nothing
wonderful in their feats of appetite, though there is in it something
of the awful and alarming. But when our host Melleville and
myself, whose ordinary breakfast in town is a cup of something—tea
or cocoa-nibs—and a piece of dry toast, at an early hour—say eight—
and then nothing until twelve, when comes the dejeuner d la four-
chette which will stand a fair comparison with an English luncheon,
I say when a couple of middle-aged gentlemen, whose regular rule
of quiet morning life is as just stated, find themselves at 8 '30 a.m. on
board a Scotch steamer, sitting down with a crowd of ravenous Excur-
sionists, and enjoying a meal consisting of two kinds of fish, broiled
ham and eggs, chops and Worcester sauce, muffins, hot buttered cakes,
oat-cakes and marmalade, taking all these in the order as I have set
them down, and as they were set down before us by the waiters,
with the accompaniments of tea and coffee, and not subsequently
suffering any inconvenience, but, on the contrary, experiencing such
a feeling of tranquil satisfaction as makes the enjoyment of a pipe in
the open air the temporary realisation of a sort of natural beatitude
which knows no regrets for the past, and only hopes, according to the
trade formula, "for a continuance of the present esteemed favours,"
then it is evident that a new existence has opened out for these two
men, who up to that moment may not have considered life so very
much worth living, or at all events could have anticipated that this sort
of living was worth remaining alive for. Now, after this marvellous
breakfast, where all but the tea and (toffee is excellent, there is, as
the Composer justly and sensibly puts it, something yet left to live
for, and that is—lunoheon!
So we sit on deck, and placidly examine the scenery which is all
familiar to us from point to point. The day continues fine, the breeze
is light; the Chevalier, actuated by the courtesy associated
with the title, stops for a minute at every desolate-looking landing
place, in oase there should be any solitaries, who, tired of their seclu-
sion, might like to avail themselves of this unexampled opportunity
of getting away from themselves, and joining the society of their
fellow men and women. But there are none; the desolate landing-
places look more and more desolate as we approach them, and in
one or two instances, assume an aspect so dreary and forbidding,
that the few passengers who had got their luggage ready packed
and addressed to some invisible Inn in these outlandish parts,
think better of their intention of disembarking, and prevent their
boxes being taken on shore, preferring to throw in their lot with
the happy Excursionists on board the Chevalier and the goods whioh
the Chevalier has provided, to encountering the awful depression
which must evidently overcome the friendless stranger landing on
that sad shore. There is one exception: a very young man, in a
tourist suit, with a Tarn O'Shanter oap, a thiok stick, two big port-
manteaus, a hat-box (why a tall hat P), overcoat, waterproof, and rugs.
He steps on to the landing-stage—I forget its name—his luggage
is placed beside him; there is no one to reoeive him, there is no
hotel in sight, no human being, nor living creature, visible for miles,
except the aged weather-beaten old man in charge of the landing-
stage. The youthful exile casts a curious glance around. We see
him, as the Chevalier casts off and hurries away, regarding us
wistfully; we see him (now through glasses) address the old man, but
the old man only shakes his head and disappears into his hut on that
desolate landing-stage. Then the last glimpse we get of this young man
—a much sadder, a much wiser, and a much older young man within
the last few minutes—is that he sits down on one of his portmanteaus
in a hopeless attitude, and so remains until he fades away and
becomes part of the vanishing distance. Perhaps when we are out of
sight he will put on his tall hat by way .of something to do. Poor
young man!
Tobermory passed, and now, to the Composer and myself, the scene
is very Boon quite new. In another five minutes we shall have
turned the corner, and. be in the broad Atlantic, with nothing
between us and America.
Collins, quoting Murray's information, informs me that here
the traveller will "probably experience, for the first time, the
Atlantic swell''—or words to that effeot. Fobd-Bamly explains that
an Atlantic swell is a sort of a peouliar roll of the big ocean wave—
but that to-day it is his opinion, as an old salt, that it won't be much.
Although I am not quite certain as to what he means by " much,"
yet this opinion, coming from Fobs-Bamlt, so far reassures me, that
I can contemplate turning round the corner and coming on to the
broad Atlantic suddenly, with comparative equanimity.
Here we are. Atlantic BweLL.imperoeptible. Beautiful September
summer day. Sun comes out uncommonly strong. Excursionists begin
pointing out to one another Staffa and lona in the far distance. As a
rule, the person who has been there before, and knows all about it,
points out Staffa as lona, and lona as Staffa, finally admitting that
he is not certain, and that, on the whole, he does not think that
those two islands, which we can just see with the naked eye in the

offing, are Staffa and Iona at all. Then, in spite of all the piotures,
photographs, histories, and guide-hooks on board, the Well-informed
Person tinds himself beset by the following questions:—
^Are Staffa and Iona together? If not, now far apart P To whom
do they belong P Where is Fingal's Cave P Who was Fingal P Was
he a poet? or a giant? or a hermit? or a saint? or a robber P Didn't
he write prophecies in ancient Oaelio P If not, who did P Hadn't
Fingal something to do'with, Ossian P The Well-informed Person—there
is always one of these superior beings on board—shows a disposition
to answer the first few interrogatories in such a manner as to inspire
confidence, and at once finds himself leoturing a small crowd of
earnest inquirers, until, on the arrival of the boat at the promised
land, he is suddenly superseded and snuffed out by the Professional
Guide, to whom is intrusted the task of personally conducting the
visitors. From the moment of his abandonment by the fickle crowd,
the Well-informed Person stands apart, with an expression of super-
oilious scorn for the Guide, and of pity for the people, who are
evidently, in his opinion, being misled and mis-instructed.
Staffa.—Landing in boats: on the basaltic rocks. Rocks chipped
op into neatly out black blocks, as if the Val de Travers Co. had taken
a eontraot for laving down an asphalte pavement, and had already
sent a heap of material, and left it there. Here we go, all the
Excursionists in a line, young men and maidens, children, fat old
women, thin old women, with the Chevalier's Guides, dressed like
stewards, to direct our steps, doing the whole distance under a
broiling sun and against time, with the oppressive consciousness that
the Chevalier, in spite of all his politeness, won't wait luncheon for
anybody, but will sit down at one o'clock punctually. Hurry
along—push on—keep your eyes on the rocks to prevent stumbling—
a few falls—up again—on we go—everybody very hot—no rest to
stop and admire—for fear of being left behind—here, round to the
right, Fingal's Cave—" Is this ..?".. . Yes
The Composer pauses at the entranoe—he is enraptured—" Is this
indeed Fingal'sP"—but the voice of the Guide interrupts. "Pass
on, please—pass on!" And then voices from behind, Now, then,
Sir, get on.'rfo, or let them come as wants to,"—and the Composer,
just on the verge of a glorious inspiration, is hustled along, and lost
to my view as I am shoved aside by one of the stout, sweltering old
ladies, carrying a basket and a big umbrella, who, after nearly
knocking me off the rocks and sending me anyhow into the deep sea
at the entrance of Fingal's Cave, begs my pardon, and bustles on.
Yes. Fingal's Cave is grand. I pick up the Composer a little
further on, and we have a few seconds quiet to admire the view of the
Ocean as seen from the Cave. Yes, it is grand—but—" Pass along,
please—time's up!" We 're the last. Where's Fobd-Bam.lt?
Where's Mellevtlle? Gone back? Yes, very beautiful—should
like to see it quietly—but get on—up here—down there—round the
oorner—look, the boats are going—how they crowd them—'tisn'tsafe—
"Now then, Gentlemen, come on!"—and blundering over the rocks,
stumbling into small pools, clutching at sharp edges, and stepping
cleverly down into deceptive hollows whioh are only receptaoles for
sea-water, we fall at last into stalwart sailors' arms, are stowed
away in the broad-beamed boats anyhow, packed closely shoulder to
shoulder, umbrellas and legs and sticks all mixed up painfully
together, and so we remain tightly wedged in, and hopelessly pro-
testing against everything and everybody, until we are gradually
unpacked again, and able to stretch our limbs on the deok of the
Chevalier.
Then we draw a long breath, and the Composer looks at me and I
look at the Composer, and we both exclaim, "Well, anyhow we've
seen 8taffa and Fingal's Cave." And we agree that, in consequence
of high anticipations on the strength of photographs, we are decidedly
disappointed, and consider that Fingal, whoever he was, might have
done much better. Fokd-Bamlt and Melleville, to whom the
show is familiar, have merely strolled about the rooks for the sake
of improving their appetites. Luncheon, whioh is not quite up to
the breakfast mark, and then we arrive at Iona.
Iona.—Much the same performance again. Boats crowded with
Excursionists, as if we were being taken in batches to be sold for
slaves. We are assisted out, and with difficulty recover the use of
our legs on the slippery stepping-stones. Guides ready to receive us.
Little ragged children selling necklaoes of shells, and shells of all
sorts and sizes; also flowers and ferns. One Guide leads the way,
another acts as whipper-in. and brings up the stragglers sharply.
Here is the Nunnery of St. Columba (who was she ? - an ancestress of
Columbus ?)—ruins —last of the Prioresses, or last of the Priors of a
monastery in 1400. Then the Excursionists, 'specially some of the
waddling Excursionists who can't keep pace with the Guide but
want to have all they can for their money, interrogate one another
anxiously—" Indeed P Very curious P" "What's he say?" "Last
of the icAo t" Priors—ah! we 're the pryers now—and as I do not
want to be hurried, and have quite lost sight of the rest of my party,
I am quite "the last of the pryers" myself. Animated, or rather
soothed by mixed feelings of sentiment, reverence, and indigestion
after lunch. I am lingering over the Prior's grave; but the Whip-
per-in won't have it "You'd better go on," he says, sternly,
"and keep up with the Guide." I obey him sullenly, as the weary
Blave moves on under the lash of the driver. Then we all gather
round the Graves of the Kings, as if for a funeral service, while
the Chief Guide tells us, as fast as he can, how many Kings of
Scotland and Chieftains occupy the small enclosure of thirty feet by
eight, which we are now examining.
An American Young Lady is very muoh interested. She stops the
Guide as he is moving oft rapidly, and says, "See here 1 if all the
Kings and Chieftains were buried in this place, what was Wallace
about all the time P" She evidently thinks that Wallace ought to
have prevented this. The Guide, rather staggered, repeats her
question, but is unable to give any answer to satisfy the fair
American. And he can't shake her off, though he walks on faster
than ever; and after each description, which he gives as rapidly
as possible, he bolts to another part of the ruin, in order to avoid her
questioning. "See here "she commences again, but the Guide
is not to be caught.
There is a Runic Cross with an inscription, and something built by
St. Martin of Tours,—prophetically appropriate, for surely he, "St.
Martin of Tours," must be the patron Saint of Messrs. Cook & Co.
and of all personally well-oonduoted Tourists.
Now the show is over, and it is time for us to stream back again,
stumbling over the ruins, picking our way across the fields, and once
more on the dusty road leading to the shore, where the children,
becoming desperate at having done but a poor day's work in Bhells,
ferns, and flowers, waylay us furiously with their commodities, and
vainly attempt to extort ooppers. Then once more we are huddled
into the boats, squeezed in shapelessly anyhow, and delivered com-
pressed, but safe and sound, to our old friend the Chevalier. Steam
up—and off again. Lovely afternoon: perfect evening. Back to
Oban. Boat's crew waiting. Onoe more in the gig (Why gigP).
and at 7.30 we are enjoying an excellent dinner, on board. Thankful
to get back once more to our oomfortable floating home, we dedioate
our first glass of Pommery '74 to the health of Staffa, Iona, and
Fingal. After dinner we discuss our next move, whioh is to go far
North to the home of the Sea Lions, and beard them, like oysters, in
their dens.

Is life worth living P Who will dare to ask,
Remembering thy nobly rounded task,
Large-hearted Earl, whose lengthened track of years,
Death-shadowed now amidst a people's tears,
Spread smiles like sunshine on the earth's dark ways P
If H. aven's approval and the people's praise,
Poverty's blessing, and the joy sublime
Of ministry that lifts the curse of crime,
If these avail to dower our days with worth,
How happy was thy life, who wealth and birth
Mad'st not a perch for pleasure, pride, pretenoe,
But vantage ground for high beneficence!
Friend of the fallen, helper of the poor,
The poor Bhall see, the fallen hear no more
That kindly presenoe, that inspiring voioe.
As in thy life their thousands did rejoioe,
So at thy death they grieve. Those toilers grey,
Who find so little sun on life's hard way,
Those helpless thralls of trade, whese spirits feel
The long relentless grinding of the wheel,
Those all unchildlike children, viotims small
Of modern Molochs, all who creep or fall
On poverty's rough road, or crime's steep slope,
Will miss the presence of incarnate hope,
In the Good Earl. Yet has their champion left
Bequests of which they shall not be bereft,
And legacies of help, in softened law,
And guardian ediot; so that Mammon's maw
Crushes them not quite wholly as of old.
There be his monuments! His heart is oold
Who reads unmoved the roll of that long life.
With nought but suffering and wrong at strife,
Or marks without a touoh of tearful mist,
The passing of the great Philanthropist.

THE OPEN DOOR!
True, stern restraint on Freedom jars;
We have no fondness, even at need,
For those stone walls and iron bars
Which form no part of freemen's oretd.
But that 'a a creed that's shaped for men,
Not human-visaged beasts of prey;
For these the shackle and the den,
Not mastery of the public way.
Who rails at bonds t The vicious brute
Whose yearning is to tear and rend 1
Free teeth, free claws shall doubtless suit
The wolf who'd pose as Freedom's friend.
Grim oruelty must bide the cage
Though loud its thousand throats may
roar.
For tigerish hate and wolfish rage
There cannot be an open door.
The bolt is loosed, the bar is dropped,
For sullen silence reigned within,
Daunted by chains the brute had stopped
Its ramping fierce, its furious din.
Throw wide the gate! And what avails P
The captive is unchanged of mood,
And its first step beyond the pales
M cans angry menace, thirst of blood.
No; sweet is freedom, and to bind,
For freemen, an unwelcome tatk;
But what is it that hides behind
The shelter of that cunning mask?
Red savagery, whose cruel glee
Gloats o'er the evil power it craves.
When Tyranny alone is free
Where is there safety—save for slaves P

That enormous fortunes have been made by

nious. By a judioious insertion of adver-
tisement he attracts a certain number of
confiding country and other clients, who,
greedy of realising fictitious profits them-
selves, hand over to him their cheques for a
one or two per cent. 'oover,' as the case
may be. There is a fall in the special Stock

is that the cover at onoe disappears, and in
a short time, though their places are soon
filled by other eager votaries, Mr. Sharps's
confiding country clients as well."

SENTIMENTAL HUMANITY.
The St. James's Gazette, last Wednesday, quoted "Humanity's"
letter to the Times, telling how its writer had seen the bird-and-cage
tri k at a Music Hall, and that it involved the death of a bird every
time it was performed. So the St. James's thought that the Society
for Prevention, &c, ought to look in occasionally at the Music Halls.
Now, in the same column,of the same number, a little higher up,
was a paragraph about M. Exile Zola, in his early struggling days,
living near a house-top, where he caught sparrows in a trap and lived
on them. Further, the St. James's Gazette remarked that the sparrow,
"carefully cooked, is a delicate morsel, and probably quite as nutri-
tions as the lark or the quail."
Good I But as it was no crime in M. Zola to live on sparrows, why
is it a crime in the Conjuror to live on canaries, especially if the
canary, carefully cooked, be little inferior to sparrow, lark, or quail P
Perhaps the Conjuror does'.eat them'.for supper: and if, as "Hu-
MASirr " reckoned, he performs the trick four times a night, then he
has four canaries for supper. Where's the harm? Except to those
who are of opinion that no singing-bird ought to be killed for food;
in which case how about the larks that at Heaven's gate sing?
But we should much like to know, as to Mr. Humanity who wrote
that letter about the Conjuror's bird to the Times last Wednesday,
does he ever eat fish? Is he fond of lobsters? Does he like crimped
salmon P Does he know that the salmon is sliced while alive P and is
it oot probable that the death-struggles of the big salmon, which
may be protracted for a considerable time, are a fitter subject for
the interference of the Society for the Prevention, &o. (if this Society
had to interfere in such matters as these) than the instantaneous
death of a sparrow or canary?
The bird is not butchered to make a Roman holiday, but killed
instantaneously to make a Showman's livelihood. If this is no
excuse for causing the death of a sparrow or canary, how much less
excuse is there for the Angler who exposes the salmon to lengthened
torture long drawn out, and for the Sportsman who wounds his birds
or mangles his ground game.
"Go, lire, poor wanderer of the wood and field!
The bitter little that of life remains;
No more the thickening brakes and verdant plains
To thee shall home, or food, or pastime yield.
Seek, mangled wretch, some place of wonted rest,
No more of rest, but now thy dying bed!"
When Mr. "Humanity " has dealt with the " Sport" provided by
the owners of large preserves, and with the selfish amusement of the
Wanton Waltonian, then it will be time enough to consider whether
the instantaneous annihilation of a bird, as a trick which forms part
of a Conjuror's stock-in-trade whereby he earns his livelihood, is an
act of wanton cruelty, or indeed cruelty at all.
By the way, there is just the bare possibility that the author of the
letter to_ the Times signing himself " Humanity," might have been
an opposition Professional Conjuror, who .had been outdone in this
very bird-and-cage trick.
Since writing the above, we have just seen the answers to " Huma-
nity," and we nave also been informed on unexceptionable authority,
that any bird used for this trick, properly and skilfully performed,
is neither killed nor injured, nor anymore alarmed than a canary
when its cage is cleaned, or when a covering is drawn over it at
roosting-time.
By a Blandford Blue.
Haecoubt, at Blandford, blandly tries to butter
The Dorset men—contemptuously they toss it,
As " bosh." aside, and, Middieurick-hke, mutter
"Inferior Dossit!"
"Silence is Golden."—Mr. Richabd Pboctob has written a Paper
on the "Language of Whist." Surely, according to Mrs. Battle
and " the rigour of the game," the only language of Whist should
be—" Whist."
"Speech is Silvebn."—No, it is copper: being a halfpenny a
word by telegram.

THE LETTER-BAG
III.—FROM A
OF TOBY M.P.
RECLUSE.
llowarden Castle, Monday.

ear Tobt,
Having accomplished
the public duty of setting
forth, I hope not too briefly,
my views on the political
questions of the day, I feel
myself at liberty to turn to
the more attractive duty—
or shall I say pleasure P—of
acknowledging: the receipt
of your kind note.
I.—My Health.
I am thankful to say that
the general state of my
health is more satisfactory
than it was before I set out
on a recent sea-voyage. At
the same time there remains
the inconvenience and discomfort attendant upon the absence of ease in the
movement of the vocal organs, which makes public speaking a little more diffi-
cult than, I own, I have found it in times past. Just before leaving the Sunbeam
I took an opportunity of testing the advances made towards restoration of this
important organ. Bu-ss-y secured the attendance of the mariners on what is, I
believe, called the quarter-deck, though, as far as I could see, no partition had
taken place in this part of the ship.
II.—A DIFFICULTY OVERCOME.
There was a little difficulty at first, for it appears that there is a growing
disposition among the crews of yachts to resent participation in services on deck,
unless it be regarded from a financial point of view as overtime. Bk-ss-y.
who I must say spares no expense to secure the comfort of his guests, said that
would be all right. So I made my speech, and the sailors got their overtime
allowance, a combination of circumstances which suffused a glow of geniality over
the proceedings, and we parted mutually pleased.
III.—I keep my Eye open.
In obedience to instructions from my medical men, I oocupy myself down heTe
with as little labour as I find possible. I read up, as usual, every morning u
certain portion of my speeohes, so as to be ready to correct any misrepresenta-
tions, wilful or undesigned. I apply the aie to the root of an occasional tree.
1 write a good many letters, and read any Blue Books that may have escaped my
attention during the stress of the Session. But, above all, I keep my eye open
and watch with interest events as they develop themselves and progress in the
political world. I observe that my young friend—if I may call him so—R-nd-lph
is still in Scotland, and I am pleased to observe that though the state of his
health is not such as is absolutely satisfactory to his friends, he has roused him-
self to reoeive Sir Fr-d-r-ck R-b-bts in order to talk matters over with him
previous to the General's departure to assume the direction of military affairs
in India. This must be a great advantage to Sir Fb-d-b-ck, who will doubtless
reoeive with the respect due to them any hints that Lord R-nd-lph may give
him upon the disposition of our military forces in India. H-bt-not-n, I note,
has gratefully retired into private life after contributing to political discussion
a weighty speech. H-bc-bt, too, has momentarily withdrawn from the scene.
I'm afraid, as compared with his successes in the former campaign, his speech has
fallen a little flat.
IV.—Mb. Ch-mb-bl-n.
This brings me to Ch-mb-rl-n, whose course I have
watched with keenest interest. He seems to have made
up his mind to outstrip me on a course I had marked as
my own. I went to Scotland to deliver a series of speeches,
and thither Ch-hb-bl-n has repaired, as Sir P-t-b
L-hsd-n did to London. He is hailed with enthusiasm
by the population, as I was, and, as happened to me, he
finds opportunity of keeping up the excitement along the
railway line by delivering political speeohes in matter-
of-fact railway stations.
V.—Reflections upon the Last Pabagbaph.
This is a very bold game played with courage, direct-
ness of purpose, fertility of resource, and hitherto with
success. 1 question whether, when he first set forth on
his campaign, he intended, or was prepared to go the
length whioh now seems to him easily reached. But en-
couraged by the evident approval of the populace, he has
set before his eyes a definite goal, and will I believe reach
it. He will not supersede me, but he will succeed me.
VI.—Not Gone Yet.
It would, however, be a fatal error to suppose that I

"EXCELSIOR! EXCELSIOR!"
So, Sir, I felt inolined to ory, when I saw the affile and graceful

ballet at Her Majesty's own Theatre, which his Lordship, the Bishop
of London, is expeoted to visit in state. On this joyous occasion the
orchestra will strike up one of Bishop's Glees.
The honoured name of Hawtrey, as Lessee and Manager of Her
Majesty's Show, ought to be good enough for the Bishop, who
doubtless remembers the well-known
Head Master, subsequently Provost of
Eton, with whom, to some of us at
least, the name of Hawtbet must
always be associated. If the Bishop
does g-o there, he '11 have a real treat,
and if he doesn't he'll lose one; for
Excelsior, as being not only amusing,
but highly instructive, ought to satisfy
most of the requirements of those very
superior persons who delight to gush
about "the true mission of the Stage";
and though here they will grieve for
the absence of the long-winded speeches
orammed with tine words, which they
oonsider the expression of true poetry,
yet they will see long-winded dancers,
who oould go on for ever, apparently;
and they will also see posing with a
real meaning and purpose in it, instead
of the vain attitudinising which they
laud as "so picturesque."
In Paris, I went to see Messalina at
the Eden Theatre, another historically
instructive ballet, developing a plot as
dramatio as that of Theodora. A
strikingly dramatio ballet is the eharpente of a drama. Action
before words was ever the stage rule, and it would, I think, be true
to say that, vice versd, the plot of any really good melodrama might
easily serve for a first-rate ballet.
The Stiver King would have been muoh better as a ballet, without
those long sermons delivered by the hero, who would then nave had
a chance of legitimately showing us how " romantio and picturesque"
he could be on one leg (this would have been quite leg-itimate), to

what" an altitude of genius " he oould rise in a pirouette, and of what
"fiery passion" he was capable in the grand pantomimic situations
of the murder of Geoffrey Ware, and in the wharf store-house, where
he frightens the Spider and his friends into fits, and then, as would
tot.. Lrrxn.
be permissible in a ballet of action, he might escape by leaping
through an open window, or by bounding off a spring-board and
disappearing through the skylight. If Excelsior—which is now
attracting, and certainly its fame is spreading—is to aohieve a sub-
stantial successful career, additions must be made to the numbers,
and the costumes must be
renewed from time to time.
Its brightness must be pre-
served at any cost, and this
outlay will ultimately re-
pay. A ballet in Acts, no
less than a drama, requires
comic relief. Such a troupe
as the Martinettis, or the
Hanlon-Lees, would be
well employed as part and
parcel of its plot.
It should commence as
early as a Drury Lane
pantomime, and end about
the same time. Our people
do not want long entr'actes,
as our theatres are Buffioi-
ently comfortable for the
spectators to remain in
them, instead of rushing
out, as in Paris, where the
audience is only too glad
to breathe the fresh air for
twenty minutes, take
refreshments and cigar-
ettes outside,or promenade
about the foyer with the
windows open.
One very noticeable fea- This is part of an All-leg-orical Tableau, in
ture in Excehior is the which, the Bishop may think, there's a
good danoing and graceful s"reat deal of 'K"a-
posturing of the men. Are they all Italians from Italian Ballet
Danoing-schools, or are they largely recruited from our ranks
of Supers? If so, it speaks immense things for "Super "-human
nature, and ought to give an impetus to all Dancing-Masters. As a
rule, men-dancers, when not absolutely of first-class talent and per-
fect training, are either repulsive or ludicrous, or both. Here it is
not so. I wish every success to this venture, and hope that Her
Majesty's will establish a reputation for this class of entertainment
alone, and then the title of the next ballet will be El Dorado. So
mote it be. yours, Medium Nibbs.
P.S.—Since writing the above I see that Miss Kate Vaughan is
now dancing in Excehior. Delighted to welcome her again: just
vot vos vaughanted. Excellent notion. But I question whether
giving a lever du rideau, with Mr. Herman Vezin and talented
assistants in it, is not a mistake, unless they dance Planche's two-
act Secret Service as a comic ballet. This might possibly add to the
attraction.

ought to be very happy, would seem to have more to fear than to hope.

are brought up by old and ex-

sea-birds do mostly congregate.
Here we shall stalk the seals,

home and cell for immense
sums, their skins being peou
liarly valuable, when dressed,
to ladies (also when dressed),
who affect seal-skin jackets.

convert hides ' into boots and

should make of it were I to try .
What a very poor helpless sort
I should have been _! I forget the name of the
of Robinson Crusoe
island where we are to lead this wild kind of life, subsisting on what
we may shoot or catch (exoept in the way of drink— as we oannot
very easily catch Pommery or Lanson, or another nice light cham-
pagne with which our host varies the entertainment, and which I
think is called Gourlay or something like it), but the Composer, who
has been once before disappointed in seal-shooting and big fishing,
is delighted at the prospect, and so am I.
Ford-Bamly knows the island well. "If it's fine when we 're
up there, it'll be difficult work getting at the seals," he says,"and
if it's bad, we shan't get a sight of one. As to fetching it at all, it's
a question of time, and. if the wind's unfavourable, we may be
days doing the distance." He speaks nautically of "fetching" the
Island. This expression takes, so to speak, the wind out of the
sails of the old proverb about Mahomet and the Mountain. Sub'
stitute "Island" for "Mountain," and then the proverb nautically
stands, "If the Island wou't came to Admiral Mahomet, R.N.,
then Admiral Mahomet, R.N. oan tell Captain Sanballat, R.N.
to '"fetohit."'
However, we are not to be discouraged, and, above all, our host
Melleville is not—and he has determined on the expedition. First,
though, we are to go, he says, to a place that Bounds to me like "Ballv-
huish." This certainly ought to be in Ireland. Ballyhuish is decidedly
Irish; and there's a joyous, jiggy kind of air about the name, sug-
gesting knee-breeches, shoes and buokles, red waistcoats, open
collars, blue stockings, loose tie, mis-shaped hat, shillelaghs, short
petticoats, bodices, and bare arms akimbo, whioh are all associated
with Irish peasantry at a fair,—perhaps more on the 8tage than in
real life, as should be from a name beginning with Bally or Ballet-
huish,—the "huish" representing the shout that Pat gives in the
excitement of the national dance. I regret to find on the map that
it is spelt Ballaohuish, and that it is on Loch Leven.
As we go along with, on the whole, a fair wind and, for the time of
year, a really wonderful supply of sun, the objects of interest are
more remarkable for their soaroity than any great variety. First, at
intervals of half an hour between each shoal, are porpoises, whose
life appears to consist in turning head-over-heels—like the dirty
little boys " two wheels a penny" in streets—only that these latter
do it for money, while the porpoises go on at it hour after hour,
aimlessly rolling over and over, in a lazy lolloping sort of manner,
as if they were monotonously humming over to themselves the tune
of the old chime, " Turn a-gain, Whit-ting-ton, Turn a-gain, Whit-
ting-ton!" and so on all day. Do porpoises sleep P If so, having
got in the habit of rolling over and over, they must still continue
it unconsciously "e'en in their sweetest dreams."
Then we watoh a number of youthful herrings, shining like silver,
as they jerk themselves up with a great muscular effort an inch above
the surface, and then sink back again exhausted. Very weak-
minded of them to show how shining they are, as for this act of vanity
they are punished by the gulls and the quackers, who Boon show them
a snort and easy way of doing small fry. And not only do the
glittering little fish attract the birds, hut even the playful porpoise
will swallow four or five of them down at a gulp if they don't get
out of his way in time, and then he '11 take two or three extra turns
after his meal, for the Bake of digestion, as if he were chuckling to
himself and saying, "Capital eating, those young herrings; capital!
Over we go again! There's more where they came from! Over we
go again T Always take two or three rolls with my dinner! Flop,
boom, over again I Here's a lark!" Occasionally we shoot at a por-
poise. But he only turns over onoe more head-over-heels, and rolls
out of the way with a sort of "Oh, don't bother me!" movement, and
disappears for a few seconds, to reappear, still doing turnovers some
distance off and well out of shot.
The porpoise is a living illustration of "multa rerolvens," whioh
might be porpoisely translated, "Turning head-over-heels lots of
times."
1 do not believe that any line of porpoises, no matter how numerous,
nor of whales either, whatever their size, could ever have been mis-
taken for the Great Sea-Serpent. If 1 feel certain of anything,
specially while in this listless state out yachting, it is of the exist-
ence of the Sea-Serpent.
"Or of a Sea-Serpent," says the Composer.
"Yes," observes Melleville, who has lately been reading Frank
Buckland's Memoirs, "it is impossible to imagine that only one Sea-
Serpent exists. Unless," he adds, correcting himself, "it is the last
of its race."
"You can't suppose," says Fobd-Bamlt, waking up and joining
in, "that captains of position, crews, and passengers nave all been
lying for years r" Then he places his book on his knees, and is off
to sleep again.
We consider this proposition silently.
The Composer is presently heard to murmur to himself that " the
Sea-Serpent wouldn't be a bad idea for a Cantata," and he disappears
below, carried away by an inspiration, to the piano. But the divine
afflatus doesn't take him further than the sofa, and when, on not
hearing the sounds of musio, I look through the skylight, I see him
stretched out fast asleep, with, I rather think, a brandy-and-soda,
half emptied, by his side. Thus with him ends the possibilities of
"The Sea-Serpent, a Cantata by Christopher Cullers, R.C.M."
But with regard to this marine monster, we have arrived at this
oonolusion, that either there is somewhere a family of Sea-Serpents—
there is plenty of room for them in the Atlantic—or the one occasion-
ally seen is the last of its race gradually expiring, and coming up to
the surface now and then to give a last look round before disappear-
ing for ever. There is something inexpressibly sad in this latter
theory about the Sea-Serpent.

cj*r— ^'
"Oh, please, Serpent, don't speak to the Man at the Wheel!"
Second objects of interest are the jelly-fish. It occurs to me that
we must have come to the very extreme of idleness when we are
sensible of the smallest excitement from watching jelly-fish.
"We try to read papers, whose news is now the ancient history of a
week ago: we try to write letters; begin them and leave off at the
bottom of the first page. "We try to read books: futile. Ford-Baklt
is the best at this sort of thing, as he takes up a book, places it on his
knees where he can't possibly see to read it, folds his arms, and goes
fast asleep. When he wakes up, if he feels more than usually
lively, he sets to work to plait ropes'-ends, and as this involves a
good deal of plucking and pulling to pieces, the employment at first
suggests oakum-picking as a fine art.
Melleville has by his side all his charts, maps, two sets of glasses,
and a couple of novels. After a while the charts weary him, he
knows the route by heart, the glasses discover nothing new, the
novels he has tried on the system of '' one down t'other come on; but
as most of the time is occupied in finding out where he left off
when he last looked at either of them, he too gives himself up to
listlessness and torpid enjoyment of the mere fact of existence, with
the consciousness of becoming gradually hungry without the necessity
"exeroise.
Occasionally, as in the instance above recorded, the Composer

retires below, and plays the piano. This is soothing. I tell him so
through the skylight, and ask him to continue. Whereupon he
immediately leaves off. Evidently I have interfered with an in-
spiration, and stemmed,—I was going to have said "damm'd," but
it does not sound polite; so, on consideration, I will say " stopped,"
—the flow of genius. I betake myself to watching the jelly-fish. We
try a little bottle-shooting, but everyone has beoome such a dead
shot that there is no variety in this form of amusement. We are
developing into lotos-eaters, when suddenly we are aware of a dead
calm, and we are not yet within measurable distance of Ballachuish.
There is nothing for it but to put into a bay—nice quiet little
siding where we oan dine—but to get there we must be towed by our
cutter. To be towed by a cutter sounds like being kicked by a tailor
Present this to Mr. Dumb Cham bo Junior.
During the day one exceptional object of interest to us has been
from time to time the approach of a large schooner yacht, evidently
bent on the same journey as ourselves. Through the glass Melle-
\ ille has made her out to be the Norseman, belonging to Mr. Brush,
K.A., who, the Captain happens to know, is on board, and, being
very fond of it, probably sailing her himself. This will give the
artist some trouble now, as the wind has dropped. We are well ahead
of the Norseman, and in faot have lost sight of him.
We are nearing Eintallen Bay—or some name like that—at a very
slow paoe, the men in the cutter rowing and singing. Oddly enough
their seleotion of songs is not at all nautioal. This present one is
about "Bill was a hackney coachman rare," which is a peculiar
favourite with the crew, on account of its offering rare opportunities
for shouting out a rough and ready chorus at the end apparently of
nearly every line, with an increased fortissimo chorus to mark the
conclusion of each verse. The sails are of no use. We are being
towed by the musical mariners towards the bay.
What dramatic changes there are at sea!
Scene I. (Afternoon up to Four.) Warm—sun—calm.
Scene II. (Pour and after.) Dark—cold—gusts of wind.
We are in the darkness of Eintallen Bay. One light ashore; pro-
bably cottage. We descend to dinner; always a pleasant time.
Dinner just finished; noise on deck; holloaing; shouting ; up we go.
The Norseman, forty tons bigger than our yaoht, has arrived late,
and is trying to crowd into this small bay, where we have settled
for the night. Plenty of room without interfering with us or two
other vessels whose lights are visible. Altercation between the
Captain of ours and the Captain of theirs: Norseman rude, we
polite. Norseman swings round, and nearly bumps us in the most
unmannerly fashion. The Norseman is not behaving well, and if it
hits anything, ought to select a craft of its own size and weight, and
not," A weaker vessel" like the Creusa.
If Mr. Brush, E.A., is sailing it himself, as I was informed, then
I say, "Better throw the painter overboard," an old jest exactly
suited to the occasion. But surely an artist ought to 'know all
about canvas. Why doesn't he adorn his own sails with his own
works? On second thoughts he leaves that to the picture-dealers,
who adorn their sales with his works. The difficulties and dangers
are overcome: it was an exciting moment; and now we return to the
saloon and, oddly enough, talk about anything exoept nautical sub-
jects. We discuss chiefly oity matters, and financial affairs. We
burst out into stories; Fobd- Bamly tells some remarkable ones about
America and Foreign travel; the Composer tolls his unique expe-
riences of the Stock Exchange; I narrate little anecdotes of half-
hours with the best Brokers; and Mellevtlle enlightens us as to
what it is to be a trustee. So we go on until I utterly and entirely
forget that I am on board a yaoht in a small bay thousands of miles
away from Piccadilly, and am only recalled to the fact that we are
not in a club smoking-room by Melleville putting the end of his
cigar into the ash-tray and saying, "Suppose we go on deck before
we turn in."
Go on deck from olub smoking-room P No—surely—why, of
course. So we go on deok and have a last look at the Norseman, and
wonder if Mr. Brush, R.A., is taking it easel-y in his berth, and if
he will get out before us to-morrow morning, and sincerely hope, as
there appears to be rather a gale springing up, that neither of us will
get loose, drag our anchors, and come whack one against the other.
So hoping, we retire to bed.
Night. Terrific noises. I pause in my reading-^I listen
-is it the
the noise
anchor dragging ?—if so—again—a pause—I listen intently

getting into his berth.

Conclusion,
THE ENGLISH ABROAD.
(By One of Them.)
In these days of Cheap Excursions, when the summer-time comet
round,
Many thousands of my countrymen repair to foreign ground,
Where their manners, as a rule,—although exceptions are not few,—
Leave a deal to be desired from a local point of view.
I have watched them on the Continent through many a season past
With profound humiliation; and the time is come at last
When I feel that I no longer can refrain, at any price,
From endowing British Tourists with a little good advice.
Lend your ears, esteemed compatriots,—ye Robinsons and Bbowns,
Who frequent Italian lakes, Helvetian peaks, and German towns,
Who recur upon the Righi, and are annually seen
Huddled up in plaids, and shiv'ring, in the chilly Engadine;
Ye, whose aspect is familiar to Parisians, Viennese,
Neapolitans, Venetians, Genoese, and Milanese;
Let me give an useful hint or two to each and ev'ry one,
As to what the Briton, whilst abroad, should do—and leave undone.
Take no notice of the persons whom you meet in boat or train,
For oivility to strangers goes against the English grain;
If they venture to address you, look them coldly up and down
With a smile of scornful pity, or a supercilious frown.
Your expression will recall to them the destiny forlorn
Whioh oreated them mere foreigners, whilst you are British-born;
Thus inoisively brought home to them, no longer will they shirk
The oonviotion that an Englishman is Nature's noblest work 1
Never raise your hats on entering a shop or restaurant,
Where, enthroned behind the counter of the smart (tablissement,
Sits a lady, whom the natives all salute as they come in;
Such politeness, in a thoroughgoing Briton, were a sin.
Speak in English to the shopmen and the waiters, by the way,
They will listen with deep interest to ev'ry word you say;—
Should they fail to seize your meaning, shout and swear, and " give
them fits,"—
A few hearty British expletives will stimulate their wits!
Always carve your name, in oharaoters indelible and bold.
Upon statues of renown, reputed worth their weight in gold,
And on palaces and churches, which are manifestly meant
To record the patronymic of an Anglo-Saxon gent.
On the very oldest Masters 'tis a truly British lark,
With the point of an umbrella or a stick, to make your mark;
Or to ohip off, here and there, a little finger or a toe
From a marble god or hero, fashioned centuries ago.
When you enter a cathedral during service, never fail
At the mummeries of ignorant idolatry to rail:
And you need not be too careful not to jostle those who pray,
As you stride about the building in your stalwart British way.
Whilst conversing with your Guide, too, never moderate your voice,
But address him in a louder tone than usual, for ohoioe;
Thus the superstitious natives will be made to understand
Why we Britons are so popular in ev'ry foreign land.
Whilst at meals, attraot the notice of your Bisters and your wives
To the gobbling Frenoh and Germans, as they juggle with their
knives,
And be sure that you revile the "beastly cooking," " sour wine,"
And " abominable service," when at table d'hote you dine.
Pray remember that, on prinoiple, such observations should
Be made audible to foreigners—they ought to do them good!
And suppose they prove offensive, you, at least, are none the worse—
For the feelings of a Parleyvoo what Briton oares a curse?
Disregard all regulations wheresoever you may go;
Foreign ediots were not made for freeborn Englishmen, you know.
In the station and the oustom-house be blustering and bold,
And on no aocount demean yourselves by doing as you 're told.
Thrust your noble nationality in everybody's face,
Show the Continent fine samples of the Anglo-Saxon race,
Whose innate superiority to Latin, Teuton, Gaul,
Is a fact that cannot fail to be acknowledged by them all!
Too Much of a Good Tama.—On Licensing Day, permission was
given, in almost every case, to Restaurants to have their dinners
accompanied by music. This fashion was all very well when quite a
novelty at the Holborn Restaurant, but the Restaurant frequenter
has no desire to become like the Old Lady of Banbury Cross, and be
told that "he shall have musio wherever he goes." A quiet dinner
will be a rarity; and the real "dinners" will be the musicians,
specially the Big Drum.

THE CONTENDING SWAINS.
A POLITICAL PASTORAL.
{Some Way after Virgil's Third Eclogue.)
Abqvmbnt.
Damcstas and MiNALCAS, two Shepherds, after some smart strokes of
country raillery, and having tried their skill in a song, refer it to Pal^mon,
a Rustic, to judge of their performance and award the crown. Paljemon,
after a full hearing of both parties, declare! himself puzzled to decide so
weighty a controversy, and—for the moment—leaves the victory undeter-
mined.
Menalcas . . Gl-est-ne. Damoetas . . S-l-sb-BT.
Palamon . . New Rustic Voter.
Damon {referred to hy Damoetas) . . Ch-mb-bx-n.
Menaleat. Ho, Swain, what Shepherd owns yon straggling sheep P
Damcetat. No matter: they are given me to keep.
Menalcas. Unhappy sheep, wide wandering o'er the plain,
Whilst you their Mistress court, but court in rain,
And fear that I her favours shall retain.
Damostas. Bah! blnnderer, is't not known, and to all men,
That you have muffed her business, how, and when?
Never again you'll win the premier prize;
Your floundering! have been watched with mocking eyes,
And in the general soorn your condemnation lies.
Menalcas. Pooh, Sir, your pipe a borrowed music plays;
My Muse you rail at, but you steal my lays.
Damoetas. Oh, you would claim all Music for your own I
The crown is mine; by singing fairly won.
A solemn match was made; you lost the prize.
Ask Damon if his beating he denies:
I think he dares not: if he does, he lies.
Menalcas. Thou sing with him, poor mimic? Never pipe
Was so profaned to inappropriate lip.
Tain thine attempts, as soon shall be allowed,
To tickle on thy straw the rustic crowd!
Damoetas. To bring it to the trial, will you dare
Our pipes, our skill, our verses to compare?
Menalcas. Talk not of daring, boaster, but begin!
I prophesy beforehand I shall win.
Palsuon shall he judge how ill you rhyme.
I '11 teach you how to brag another time.
Damoetas. Dullard, come on, and do the worst you can I
I fear you not, nor grander, older man.
Silence, ye Swains, and with attention wait,
For we have business here of high debate.
Palcemon. Sing then; these fields afford a proper p'ace,
This garland shall the happy victor grace;
The challenge to Menalcas shall belong,
Damcetas shall sustain the under-iong:
Each in his turn your tuneful numbers bring*;
By turns the tuneful Muses love to sing.
Menalcas. From the great Sire of all the gods above
My Muse begins: all hail the Liberal Jove!
To him the care of all by right belongs,
My flock he blesses, and admires my songs.
Damoetas. Me all-conserving Phoebus more inspires;
He lights our courses and he tunes our lyres.
Your god and you your charge have failed to keep,
You've shirked your duties and misled your sheep.
Menalcas. With pelting stones persistently you plied
My nook, in pleasant pastures feeding wide,
And now my careful shepherding's decried!
Damoetas. The nymph you claimed has come unasked to me,
Glad from your feeble folly to be free.
Her mastery now is mine, and still shall be.
Menalcas. Not so. Again she '11 seek my constant arms;
Loyal to the old love, yield me her charms.

Let her once more my honeyed accents hear,
She '11 shrink from your harsh notes with loathing: fear.
Damcetas. Pooh! What avails your " long and dreary" flight?
She knows yon now, and shudders at your sight.
You spread your net, but I possess the prey,
And challenge you to lure the nymph away.
Menakas. Election-day's at hand, and then she '11 come,
Like a strayed dryad, to her Woodman home.
Damcetas. Nay. with her now I'm more in graoe than you;
You'd fell her trees, her sylvan altars hew.
You and your axe she bids a long adieu!
Menakas. Absurd! Right well she knows mine is the hand
To guard her Treasure and improve her Land,
To lop the straggling growths that bar her way,
And teach or thrill her with my tootled lay.
Damcetas. Nonsense! To hive, or tithe, her golden store,
To till her pastures till they yield her more,
To give Protection to her fields and farms,
Shield her from native broils and foreign arms,
My hands with yours have more than equal tkill.
My pipes than yours more musically trill;
Whilst never herd I with that robber host
Who make your artful championship their boast;
Wolves by the Shepherd tempted near the fold,
Thieves by the Watohman warned of hoarded gold,
Whose hands the faithless priest dares not restrain
From ruthless pillage of the hallowed fane.
Menakas. Who loathed the Nymph might say, oh letlher be,
Damcetas, doomed to test thy works and thee!
Bat no, one might as well decide to join
Dog-foxes in the yoke, or shear the swine,
As link her fate with thine, or from thy rule,
For all thy sounding cry, expect much wool.
What loualiest you denounoe, your friends and you,
That, given the chance, most readily you do;
What notliest, out of power, you advocate,
That longest, when you sway, the Nymph may wait.
Woe to her, if she trust to oare of thine
Her Land, her Gold, her Harvest, or her Shrine I
Pakemon (puzzled). So nice a difference in your singing lies,
I hardly know which most deserves the prize.
Eaoh of you pipes a more than Lydian lay.
Both of you promise lots. What can I say?
Arcades ambo! Yet, perhaps—for ohoice—
Well, for the present, I'll reserve'my voioe!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The TVuth About the Stage, by " Cobin." Vulgarly written, un-
interesting, exoept perhaps to a limited few, and like most theatrical
memoirs, uncommonly dnll reading. Truth is generally supposed to
be unpalatable; but in this form it is nauseous. Who wants to be
bored with the personal experiences and opinions of a, presumably,
middle-aged provincial aotor, probably a Blighted Tragedian? for
of this and nothing more valuable does the book consist. Occasionally
the writer, whoever he may be, gushes about a certain Provincial
Manager, who, it appears, like Papa Eccles in Caste, has always
been a very clever man, if he had only had his chance." So high
is "CoBDf's" estimate of this eminent person's talents, which he
seems to say have not been duly appreciated in the Metropolis, that
he thinks, if there were a subventioned National Theatre,' this
Mr. Vincent Cuummtles ought to be placed at the head of it.
Now we shall argue ourselves hopelessly ignorant when we admit
that, having but a very limited experience of Provincial theatricals,
we have never seen this distinguished performer act. We believe that
he did once, perhaps twice, it may have been oftener. appear profes-
sionally in London, but in what character (something Shakspearian, we
imagine) we are not aware, and (how we now regret the lost oppor-
tunity!) never even thought it worth while to inquire. "Cobin"
hints pretty plainly that the Unappreciated One ought to have a
Benefit! Why not? Why should London wait P We will head the
list with one guinea down—being unable to afford more in consequenoe
of the withdrawal of Paradox—in order to insure for ourselves the
treat which we have missed, up to now, of seeing Mr. Vincent Crttm-
mles play something, anything, no matter what, we leave it to him.
_ Mr. "Cohen " gives a list of managers and actors whom he con-
siders worthy of being mentioned, by him, as models for imitation in
their publio capacity and private life. Very nioe and very kind,
though to name examples seems invidious. But, speaking for our-
selves and the public generally, as with a great Minister, or Lawyer,
so with the artist, how, as far as the interests of the publio are con-
cerned, private life can affect professional performance, we do not
quite see. As an artist, be he author, aotor, painter, or sculptor,
the publio have to judge him. For his work as an artist the publio
pays, and so long as he honourably, and in a businesslike manner,
discharges his part of. his contract with the publio, why should the
publio wish to go outside that contract, in order to pry into his
domestic life, which is no business of theirs at all Y
We do not refuse our guinea for a stall to hear Signor Ufaoini,
because that unrivalled artist ran away with another man's wife;
nor do we shut our eyes and stop our ears when Signora Tbxlla.
enters upon the stage, because we happen to know, what all the
world knows as well as ourselves, where her diamonds oome from,
and how two gentlemen of family and position ruined themselves
utterly for this marvellously-gifted Syren. No; we thank our stars
—our operatic Stars—for their voices and exeoution, and, listen en
chanted.
We are far from denying that, accidentally, the knowledge of a
professional person's spotless character in private life adds a separate
and distinct pleasure to the delight his performance gives us, if he
be an artist, or to our interviews with him if he be a solicitor,
portrait painter, barrister or even doctor; though we can't see that
suoh knowledge would be any comfort to us in the case of a
dentist. However, enough said on this subject, whioh, after all, is of
little real consequenoe to anybody outside a limited domestio circle.
We turn with pleasure to the green covers of In a Grass Country,
by Mrs. Lovett Cambhon. It begins in a fishing village, and pro-
ceeds to hunting-quarters,'later on, quite seasonably. It commences
with a "smack" country, and goes to a "crack" country. The
three heroines are charming each in her own way. It is well sketched,
full of character, with sharp observations on men and women—
not too hard on anybody—a dear story carefully written, and there-
fore easily read. Recommended.
Here too is delightful reading! The Pytchky Book of Refined
Cookery and Bills of Fare—the only bills we oare to see, though we
won't say we are not sometimes a little afraid of them. It is oom-
piled by " Major L ' • V
But Major L.'s arrangement of menus is not, on the whole, so good
as Sir Henrt Holland's in his admirable work on Food and
Feeding, because the idea is not based on the excellent principle of
getting at your piece de resistance as soon as possible, and then going
in for your palate-ticklers and high art dishes if you will. Not that
the Major is always for the kiokshaws first and the substantiality last,
for " Variety" is his motto, and his receipts seem to be excellent. A
well-arranged book this,—bills first, and the receipts to follow. Also
recommended for the use of English Students, and, of course, Irish
Stew-dents.

NOTES FROM THE CHURCH CONGRESS.
{Three Days' Report)
Mr. J. C. Horsley, R.A., is the right man, the lightest
man possible, bat for once, in the wrong place at a Church
Congress. Qu'allait-il /aire duns cetle galere f Much
better to have liberated his soul and have testified in an
Art Congress, or in the Council Room at Burlington Ar-
cade-my. Girls brought up from childhood to earn their
living as Professional Models are, we should be inclined
to say, in a large proportion, if not a majority, of cases,
as modest as young ladies educated in the strictest stew'd-
prune fashion. It is the same with the hard-working
ballet-girl, similarly reared, and with the actress who,
coming of a theatrioal family, has been earning her bread
by the Stage ever since she could first toddle on in a
Drury Lane Pantomime. Honi suit qui mal y pense.,
J. C. Horslet
Wouldn't put it ooar6ely,
But explains to the Clerical Society,
That artists, with their paints
Are not all saints,
Nor their models, all models of propriety.
There is still an official called "The Chaplain of the
Fleet." It is no longer a prison chaplaincy, but a naval
one, and is held at the present moment by the Rev. Mr.
Habbord. Appropriately he should change his name to
Starboard or Larboard, though the latter is, we be-
lieve, obsolete. But, if names are to be appropriate, how
fitting it would have been if the Chaplain of the Fleet, in
old days, had been Dean Swift?
The Rev. Canon G. Venables insisted that what was
wanted generally among the Clergy was "heartiness."
Let them "be hearty, and not extravagant." "There
ought," said the Canon, "to be a carefully drawn up,
lively, hearty office for the institution of a Priest to the
eharge of a parish." First-rate notion. This is where
"The Churoh and Stage Guild " might come in usefully
and ornamentally; also the Ballet. Put it under the
management of the Rev. Augcsius Harris of Drury
Lane. Dances of Parishioners by Dat/ban, and of the
Infant and Sunday Schools by Madame Katik Lanner's
pupils. Full-blown Brass Band in attendance. Canons
to right of him, Canons to left of him, and the Great
Instituted himself in the middle. Then the Canon Ven-
ABLESsays, " The people themselves should be the leaders
in that peouliar office." Well, he is right—it would be a
very peculiar office. But he is wrong in suggesting the
people as leaders, as they would be mere amateurs. No;
leave it to professionals. The Author of Saint* and
Sinneri—not Dr. Doran, but Mr. Hermann Wilson
Jones of the Oxford Street Circuit, Author of The Rev.
Mr. Claudian and other light and leading plays, might
sketch out the plot for the occasion.
The general impression was that, as the seating every-
where had been vastly improved, some further addition
might be made to the forms.
The Rev. Charles Bollock spoke on the Church and
the Press, but drew in his horns. After thishe talked about
books and magazines. He recommended every parish "to
fill its basket with good wheat, and then there will be
no room for chaff." Won't there? Mr. Punch, the Uni-
versal Parishioner, will provide him with a lot of it. If
he has no use for it, he may return it, if he can.
The question of good books was, of course, brought
under consideration. Several of the Clergy would have
volunteered some useful opinions on "good books" for
the Cseiarwitoh and the Cambridgeshire, but consented
to defer their remarks until the disonssion on the " Native
Races" came on. It was rumoured that a sporting Arch-
deacon had said he wished he were Archer. But this
report, like children under twelve, has not been confirmed.
Finally, it was carried with acclamation that the
Church Congress next year should be held at Wake-
field. Of course, mail cela va sans dire, it will be under
the Presidency of Mr. Henrt Irving as the Vicar, faced
by Vice-Chairman. Mr. Art a mi Roberts, of Wideawake-
field, smoking his Poet Wills's bird's-eye, Yardlet and
Stitjtens's own mixture. The Congress then dissolved
itself and went home early.

A DOUBTFUL COMPLIMENT.
"Ah, Sir, wr don't often get a Leg like tours to fit! There's bomb
Credit in fitting a Leo lire tours, I can tell tod!"
APTER-THOUGHTS.
(From Lord Or-nv-lU's Note book.)
Mem, on retiring to rest Friday night, October \0th.—Jubilee of Munioipal
Corporations over! The Provincial Mayors oughtn't to have dined at the Free-
masons' Tavern, they 're all such " Odd Fellows." ThiDk I made a real hit this
evening. Cross and Blackwell—I mean Cross and Balfour— (Mem. Wish
I'd pretended lapsus lingua, and spoken of them as Cross and Blacxwell—
pretty pickle they'd have been in—think out this notion for next opportunity)—
speaking first, made it all the better for me.
Happy hit of mine about my "not being able to go anywhere out yachting
without meeting a Cabinet Minister." It told immensely. Regret I didn't im-
mediately add, "and I need hardly say they were ' all at sea." If that had
been given in my usual quietly humorous way, with a sly glance right and left,
it would have been enormous. Note it for next chance.
Then when I said that Balfoub and Cross had " taken the wind out of my
sails," which the Mayors of the sea-side plaoes specially enjoyed,—in faot I
thought the Mayor of Hull would have had a fit, he laughed so heartily,—I ought
to have added that " next month they won't be troubling themselves about my
sails, as they '11 be busy about their own oanvass."
This sort of thing tells immensely at the moment, and precisely the same good
opening once missed, seldom occurs again. But, Happy Thought—tint joke
about canvass " will come into my next speeoh at the Royal Academy Banquet.
It will go even better there. Wish that years ago I had begun writing for Punch.
Just getting into proper form for it now. . . . Let me see—did I wind up my
watch P . . . Wonder how my speech will look to-morrow morning in the papers?
. . . Think it's all right. . . . Wish I'd always been writing for Punch.

THE LETTER-BAQ OF TOBY, M.P.
IV.—FhOM THE UNSLEEPING Pakcner.
Birmingham, Monday.

ear Toby,
I gladly seize the oppor-
tunity of a quiet day to write
a few lines to you, hoping
they will find you well, as
they leave me at present. I
daresay you have observed
that I have of late been on
the wing. My oolleagues may
go fishing, or Bhooting, or
yachting; but I am a man of
business, and aooustomed to
attend to business. H-b-
T-NGT-N and H-NEY J-M-8
may have made good bags
since the Twelfth. But I
fancy that sinoe I went out
on the tramp at the beginning
of August, I have brought
down more birds.
By the way, what has be-
come of H-NBY J-M-8? We
were accustomed at this period
of the year to hear him twit-
tering at Taunton, or some
other place, settling imperial affairs. He has not appeared upon the scene as
yet, and is, I think, on the whole well advised. He is a pretty young man,
out not strong enough to swim in the troubled waters of politics.
Now, / like it. Toby. I do not care about your Bpells of fair weather such
as we had immediately on going out of office. There was for me too much
bowing and scraping between the two Front Benohes. It was a very thin
crust, I know, and would have broken through in a twinkling if the Tones had
gone wrong on any point. But, artificial as it was, it did not suit my taste, and
so I broke away, beginning at Hull, and going, as J-M-8 L-wih-e humorously
puts it, to a place that differs only by a vowel.
I have enjoyed myself immensely during the past six weeks. There is only
one thing necessary to complete my satisfaction. I should like to know what
Gl-dbt-ne, H-bt-ngt-n, and H-bc-tjbt think of my goings on. I don't believe
Gl-dst-ne cares very much. He means to be out of it soon, and in the meantime
is very much of my opinion on the points I have raised, only declines to take any
fresh departures. H-bt-not-n is, I fanoy, chiefly bored. He does not bear me
any malice, but would be exceedingly obliged if I wouldn't be bringing up new
things. He will come along slowly, with one hand in his pocket and a scowl on
his face, like a man who has got up too early in the morning. But he'll oome,
and if the Tories are looking to him to put a spoke in my wheel, they '11 fina
their mistake.
But H-b-c-b-t P Ah 1 that would be funny if it were not too pathetic I
remember, as it were but yesterday, how he came down to Birmingham, and
patronised me. That was some half-a-dozen years ago, and his prospects were
looking very brilliant. He was, next to Gladstone, the crack speaker on the
Liberal side. He had his triumphal progress, in the course of whioh he visited
Birmingham, and all the papers were full of what he said, and what they had
to say thereupon. He was running straight for the reversion of the Leadership
of the Liberal party, and though I don't believe that, in any circumstances, he
would have won the prize, he at least had the satisfaction of contemplating it
aa within his reaoh. But where is he now? Though I say it what shouldn't,
there's a comet in the sky, and the ordinary constellations are singing very
small.
I was much amused the other day to read his warm tribute of admiration of
It. JSome people might think he was jealous. On the contrary, he was
could not say too much in praise of " my right hon. friend." And
r-Y, too, not usually regarded as a humorist. But what could

"Fox et prirterea nil"—but it
was a Stag, after all!
support of a resolution advooating "Union among the
different sections of the Liberal Party under the leader-
ship of Mr. Gl-dst-ne?" Yet even amid the mental
anxiety attendant upon the unwonted exertion of making
a joke, C-btn-y did not fail to pay a tribute to me.
TheBe are little things, but they show how the wind is
blowing. I shall get my own way in the end, a success
largely attributable to the fact that I have a way
unmistakeably indioated and resolutely followed. Amid
a company of shifting politicians anxiously looking out
for a sign, a man capable of making the sign hirn>elt and
dauntlessly construing it, is certain to have a following.
Ponder on these things, my young friend, apply them to
the direotion of your own affairs, and may Heaven bless
you.
I generally conclude my addresses with a verse of
poetry. But I have during my tour used up a large
stock, and you will probably excuse me, and believe me
to be Yours faithfully, J. Ch-mb-bl-w.
To Toby, M.P., The Kennel, Barkt.
P.S.—I have just grown a new orchid. Mean to call it
after F-bst-b, for whom, as I mentioned at Bradford, I
have a great esteem. Besides F-bst-e always had an
orchid manner.
A SCARE FOR SPORTSMEN.
Fbom the Globe of
October 6th we extracted
the following item of
news, whioh we knew
would rejoice the heart of
e very true En glish Sports-
man:—
'' A telegram from Vienna
states that the Prince of
Walks preserves the strict-
est incognito. He has paid
several visits to the Exhibi-
tion, and has taken walks
through Pesth unattended.
While staying with Count Festetics be went a good deal about
the country, visiting the peasants' cottages, and performing many
kind acts of charity. The sport in the preserves of Count Fbs-
tetics was very good. Among the 'game* shot were forty-
two foxes, of which eleven fell to the Prince's gun. The fox is
not held to bo free in Hungary."
His acts of charity included relieving the poor in the
Hungary distriots. Excellent. But now as to the sporting
extraordinary. The Prince may, acoording to the tele-
gram, "preserve the strictest incognito," but, evidently
from this, he was not inolined to strictly preserve foxes.
That Count ./Esthetics— no, we beg his pardon. Count
Athletics—no, dear us, wrong again—we should say,
Count Festetics—should be a Vulpecidist, is what would
naturally be expeoted of a "furnner." But that Bome
eleven foxes should have fallen victims to H.R.H.'s
deadly aim! Heavens!—when, as we were preparing to
justify the conduct of H.R.H. in the eyes of English
sportsmen, up-stairs rushed a boy with some other
evening's Globe, containing this correction of the above
information:—
"His Royal Highness, it seems, shot seven stags the other
day, not foxes, as was incorrectly stated at the time."
Ah! the world of sport breathes again. Home Securities
have gone up with a bound. Stags are very like Foxes
in Hungary, hence the mistake. But what if H.R.H.
had indeed shot foxes in Hungary, he would only have
been acting in accordance with his rule which has made
him everywhere so popular; that is, of doing in furrin
parts as furrin parties do. However, he "did not shoot
that fox, brave Doys 1" and he can sing, with the sailor
in Pinafore, that, "in spite of all temptations" (to shoot
foxes) "he remained an Englishman," an English sports-
man, and let Brer Fox go free.
News fob the Sandwich-Men in London. — The
old town of Sandwich is once again to have a port and
harbour. Sir Watkin is said to be taking considerable
interest in the movement. If it suoceeds, he will take
more later on. This is now one of; the many burning

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Royalty Restored, in Two Volumes, by Mr. Fitzgerald Mollot,
who professes to give ub a social history of the Wits and Beauties of
the Merry Monarch's Court. The work is written in a pleasant style,
tinged with an affectation of the mannerisms of the period he is
describing', which assimilates fairly well with the quotations from
Evelyn, Pepys, and such well-known writers. But such a social
history ought to have been a chronique icandaleuse, otherwise it
tells us very little with which we were not already acquainted.
The horrors of the Plague, details of the Great Fire, the storv of
the Popish Plot and of that scoundrel, Titus Oates, neither a wit
nor a Beautv of the Court, should have had no place in this social
history. If the rit intime of Charles and his dissolute Court
cannot throw into the shade the stories of the Regency, then in these
days of memoirs and revelations, we shall gradually come to look
upon the Second Charles and his friends as muoh maligned, and to
consider whether, by some typographical error in History, the Merry
Monarch is not a misprint for the Moral Monarch. From the expec-
tations whioh Mr. F. Mollot in his preface had raised, we were
disappointed with this latest edition of the story of the Beauties
and the Beast.
As one volume of a most useful, and in every sense, readable series
called Th« World's Workers, brought out by Messrs. Cassell & Co.,
the eldest daughter of Charles Dickens has published a collection
of incidents in her father's life "most likely/' she thinks, "to
interest and to appeal to young people." The result, at all events,
is most acceptable to the grown-up, old, and middle-aged, who know
their Dickens pretty well by heart, and have read all that can be
told about him in the Life and Letters. Whether this present
little work—a labour of the purest affection—will lead children to
read Charles Dickens's works, or whether this is by any means the
best way to give them a Dickensian taste, is open to question, and
must remain a matter of individual opinion and experience. For
ourselves we should say decidedly not; that the ordinary course being
the reverse of what" Mamie Dickens" has attempted, that is to say,
that a perusal of the books!leads to an inquiry into the writer's private
TQU limit, s
and'personaVoharaoter.lwhile a knowledge of the latter would not be,
to most people, any inducement to read his books. The two things
are to the external public entirely distinct, though we can under-
stand how naturally they come to be closely associated in the mind
of so devoted an admirer as his own daughter. Still, whether for
young or for old, this little book, coming from suoh a source, will be
gratef ully received. We wish it had appeared at Christmas time,
which to some of us, is peculiarly associated with the name of
Charles Dickens, whose Carol or Chimes, or whatever might
happen to be his story for the time, was sure to be one of the Christ-
mas literary presents bought for the elder boys, while the Annual of
our old friend Peter Parley went to the younger ones. Pleasant
Christmas mornings those! New silver coinage, fresh from the
Mint, wonderful books in brilliant bindings, with highly coloured
illustrations inside, and then the prospect of grand festivities in the
evening!
Another volume of the same series is given up to Handel. The
monogTapheress is Eliza Clarke (is it "Mrs." or "Miss"?), and
her book we recommend to everyone who, wanting to learn all about
the great Composer, is pressed lor time, and can only take a turn at
the Handel for half-an-hour, or so. It is amusing to be reminded
that he wrote an Oratorio called Theodora, which the great ladies of
the day would not go to hear, because the story was not sufficiently
interesting to suit them. But the plot was evidently not the same
as Sardou's Theodora, which 8arah Bernhardt has made her own
particular character, as Handel oalls his plot " a Christian story,
which the French dramatist's certainly is not. We know very little
of Handel from himself. He was not a man of letters—very few
could be found; but he left a wealth of notes, with which the world
has been thoroughly satisfied.
Solomon's'Mines, by Rider Haooard. What a weird name! It
sounds like a sort of first cousin to Rogue Riderhood, only infinitely
more tragic and grim. What awfully overpoweringly thrilling
works ought to come from the brain of a man with such a name as
this. I regret that Mr. Dumb Crambo Junior is not on the spot
to f umiBh us with a fancy portrait of " the" Rider Haooard. Post
equitem sedet atra cura must be his motto. However, what we have
to do with, just now, is his latest book called Solomon's Mines. This
ought to have been worked up into as powerful a romance as Treasure
Island. But the promise of its commencement is not fulfilled. There
is a false ring about the narrative, which deprives it of that absorbing
interest which ought so to master the reader that he cannot put aside
the book for a'moment until he has reached the end, and learnt how
the heroeB have escaped. The introduction of a low comedian into
it (Oh, Rider Haooard! not up to your own name by any manner
of means!)—a naval officer with an eye-glass and gutta-peroha
collars—is a mistake, as forced humour must always be. Then the
almanack and the eclipse, among savages, have done similar service
on several previous occasions, while a parallel can be found for the
use made of the Lieutenant's false teeth, in somebody's wig in an
Indian tale (the name of which does not reour to us at the moment;
but, by the way, what a good title—Somebody's Wig.') where the
would-be scalper is terrified by all the hair coming off in his hand,
while the scalped one remains in the best possible health and spirits.
Solomon's Mines, all the same, is worth reading. It is clever; if
anything, it is just a bit too clever. But in future please don't forget
that your name is Rider Haggard, and "write as sich." Yes, Sir,
if there is anything in a name, you ought to have been the Author of
The Headless Horseman.

SHORT ANECDOTE BY BEN TROVATO.
The other day, Mr. J. C. H-bsl-y, R.A., entered a
music-shop. He is an excellent musician, and. a great
admirer of the works of Handel and Abne.
"1 want," he said to the Shopman, "I want to see
some old songs of about a century ago. I cannot sing the
old songs myself, but wish to make a selection for a
friend."
The Shopman paused thoughtfully; then shook his
head, and replied,
"Very sorry, Sir, we haven't any old songs in stock;
but I can show you some of our new ditties, if you care
But before he could finish the sentence, Mr. H-bsl-y
drew back horrified, exclaiming, "Nudities!'" And,
darting'such a look at the man as ought to have shrivelled
him up on the spot, he strode out of the shop.
THE MARES AT THE MANSHUN HOUSE.
Well, I must say as I feels werry sorry for the camming Lord
Mare, having to foller on such a dubble-barrelled steepel-chaser as
his predesesser. He '11 have to put up one or two hextra Staples to
keep him all right and tite. Wot a gallacksy of glorious Bankwets
have preceded each other without paws, month after month and
weak after weak. Lords foilers Commons, as is natral, and Judges
foilers Common Counselmen, whioh isn't, and Bishops comes after
Bankers, which they shouldn't, and Gills follers up Her Madjesty's
Ministers, whioh they shood: and then, as a winder up, we has all
the Mares and Maresses of the hole united Kingdom—as it ort to be,
but isn't—a oommin hundreds of miles to a grand Ball, and all deck-
orated with suoh massiv reel gold chanes as, I was told, if all linked
together, wood have been strong enuff to have wayed the anker of a
70 pound three Master, and long enuff to have reeohed from the Lor
Courts in the Strand to Mr. Attembubbow's the Porn Brokers at the
oorner of Chancery Lane 1 Habtent Homen.' And let me say this
for them afore I goes any f urder, that a finer or a bigger or a helthyer
looking set of gentlemen I have never seed henter the onerd Manshun
House since I fust waited in the Egipshun All of dazzling light.
Sam of us well-seesoned atendents, as we now calls ourselves, who
has had a large experience of the effeos of enthousiastick dinners on
enthousiastiok gents as has been a travelling all day, was a leetle
afeard as the gests mite have looked jest a leetle seedy and sleepy
wen they marched in about eleven o'clock. But no, they wun and
all looked as brite and as kean and as intellygent as if they had jest
cam out of the conventual ban-box, tho they wood suttenly have
reqwired a hextry big 'un.
There was wun fine-looking Mare and his good-looking Maress, and
their brite-looking Dorter, as looked capital spessimens of ournorthen
eountys, so I was of course surprised to hear as they come from Smith
sheelds. The ever-poplar dramattiok perf ession was theretogive'em
all a arty weloome. Mr. Oboustus Abbis worlst away with a oharmin
partner as if he quite bleeved it to be in accordance with Human
Natur, Mr. John Hollinoskd was there two with his beautiful dorter,
and Mr. Banqcboft was as oonspickuous as usual. I was glad to
overhear him tell a delited Common Counsel Man that he had not
given up the Stage, but only the handling of the ribbons, witch I
should have thort wood have been better left to his better harf, but
praps upon the whole he's right.
The Lord Mare looked partickler fresh and brite at about harf-past
two, hay hem. As he had only had his magistrate's work to do, and
go to three or four meetings and attend a great public dinner as the
gest of the hevening, and then to receive about a thowsand wisitors
later on, of course that was rayther a slack day for him. There was
wun thing as struck all us Waiters werry strong, and that was the
grate call for Corffee, another bad sine of the progress of tea-total-
lunacy we all thort, till we rememberd as all the gents had jest come
from the d inner-tabcl, witch consoled us.
They all spoke werry well of the maynu and the wines, but from a
glance I got of one as was left on the tabel with my egsperienoedeye,
I shood scarce look upon it as quite hup to our Manshun House mark.
I think as I noticed a hutter habsence of foi grar. The wines two
might ha' been holder without no fear of dotage. I was literally
amazed at dishcovering that there was no less than three reel Lord
Mares! My only wunder is that our own hollowed Coporashun hever
allowed it. They always was a libberal set, but I wunders as they
didn't draw the fine at One Lord Mare, One and indiwizabel. Bboww
told me as there was only one Irish Mare present and he was a Lord.
Wot could have kept 'em away P Was it gelosy, or mal der Mare, or
un sisterly disaffection, or was they persuaded hy Mr. Boycott? Who
nose? Of course there's no acounting for taste, nobody never tried,
but I thinks of the too, I'd rayther be a umbel hed Waiter and go
where I liked, and buy and sell as I liked, and ginerally do as I liked,
than to be even the prowd Mare of Cork or of Bonnygal, but under
the constant super wishun of prying Mr. Boycott. Ana wis I bleeves
is what they calls Ome Rule. I sumtimes thinks as we married men
gits quite ome rule enuff in this 'ere blessed country, the land of the
brave and the Ire, but we ain't alters being a fullered about to see wot
houses we gos into for a drink, and then to be told as they oarn't
serve us ooz of Mr. Boycott. I hopes as we shan't find Sir Wilful

THE MODEL BRITISH MATRON."
Mr. B-ral-y, R.A. [as the M.B. Matron). "Oh dbab! Oh deab! Who could ha' bat fob THATt"
Larson a trying of the same little game, tho I rayther thinks as his
frend Mr. Local Hopshun muet be a werry near nay hour of Mr.
Boycott.
I got a peep now and then into the Ball Room from onr little corner,
and was pleased to see that the stately Mares confined theireelves to
cquadreals and such-like dances, and left the rayther too affecsionate
Wallses to the younger and less dignified ofishals, such as Common
Connselmen and Town Clerks and setterer.
I don't no as I'm werry partickler, but I suttenly shood draw the
line at Wallses for a portly and dignilide and chained Mare, and to
they most on 'em did. Of course there's allways a few eiseptions to
all good rules, and there was there, but they was mostly confined to
little burrows and fishy Forts, so they was easily owerlooked and did
not much interfere with the ong tarmbel as the Germans says, which
was sertainly uneek. We broke up abont 3, and I was pleased to see
from a glance at the Hat Plate that whatever they were in Folitios
when at home, the Municipple gesta wen at the Manshun House was
Libberal to a man, Kobbbt.

Dramatic change of scene. Last night murky, this morning bril-

yacht, Norseman, R.A.,va. the bay, we are off to the Scotch plaoe
with the Irish name—Ballaohuish.
Scene I.—Fine breeze, lovely weather. Now we sail with the
gale, &o.
Scene II.—Weather beastly: gusts from the mountains.
Loch Leven.—Pouring. No use stopping on board. "Let us land,"
Melleville proposes, interview the prorietor of the hotel, and get
a trap to take us to see the Pass of Glenooe."
By all means. Carried nem. con. Ford-Bamly says it is just the
very day for seeing the Pass of Glenooe, as it ought to be done—he
speaks of doing the pass as if it
were a conjuring trick—in the
mist. He tells us that this is
quite the rainiest part of Scot-
land. Does he think from his
experience that there is any
chance of its holding up P No
he doesn't: in fact ne is sure
that the rain will get worse
and worse. But what of that P
He, personally, hay waterproof
hat, coat, and high fishing-
boots, and is ready for any-
thing.
We land. The hotel may
looklivelyinthe finest weather,
but now its appearance is that
of highly respectable misery.
A few elderly and feeble tour-
ists are in the sitting-room,
one asleep, another wandering
sadly about, occasionally stop-
ping to flatten his nose against
the window pane, sighing
wearily, while two elderly
ladies and a very old gentle-
man, a party of three, are
wrapped up and stowed away
in a corner, to be left there till
called for, and, hut for a vigilant
landlord, running a consider-
able chance of being forgotten
altogether. Patients waiting in a dentist's ante-room on a damp day
present a cheering spectacle compared with the aspect of these
miserable tourists. They seem to be the remains of a once large
party, which had gradually dwindled away without paying the bill,
leaving the feeblest, and probably the wealthiest, as security for the
amount. One or two, here and there, like flies at the end of autumn,
are doddering about the large sitting-room, to whioh not even a
recently-lighted Are, struggling to look bright and cheerful in the
most depressing circumstances, can impart any idea of warmth or
comfort.
There are also two young men in the hall, sitting mournfully among
their luggage, and looking out with yearning gaze for the long-ex-
peoted coach that is to take them away for ever. They are dressed,
in perfectly Scotoh Tourist Suits, carrying plaids, waterproofs, um-
brellas, and stout crooked-handled sticks for climbing. I expect to
hear them say to one another, that is if they have the heart to talk
at all, with rain pouring down on all sides, and everything and
everybody cold, damp, and dreary"Eh, Sanbtjs mon, but it's jest
a wee bit moist." So I am considerably surprised when the more
Scotch, if possible, of the two says to his friend, in a subdued tone,
"Dis done, Eugene, savez-vous a quelle heure part-il, le—comment
s'appelle-t-il f" "Le Co-atch," suggests the other, whioh the first
speaker accepts as correot, and continues, "Oui—le Coatch pour—"
'• Le bateau 7" says his friend mournfully, "Oui—" and then he
gives him the required information.
These two young Frenchmen, what could they have been when at
home? Gay Parisians P What brought them here P The love of
travel, or the wish to ascertain for themselves if all they had heard
about the Scotch climate was true? Sad experience. Neither Eugene
nor Anatole will come here again. They looked wretched enough in
my eyes when I thought them Scotchmen on their own native heath,
and their name Maogregor; but now I know to what nationality
they belong, they seem to me to be doubly, nay trebly miserable.
Never did I see two such unlively Gauls.
Mellevule informs us that the traps will return presently—

Sir William Waterproof, the Black
Knight.
[" Traps" sounds unpleasant. "Traps for Tourists "—as most show
places are. But Melleville, of course, means "vehicles "]—and
that we shall have one to ourselves—not with other damp tourists—
for visiting the Pass of Glenooe.
_ The coach arrives. The two damp young Frenchmen show some
signs of alacrity in climbing up on the roof. The other "dismal
Jemmies"—I call the lot dismal Jemmies and Jemimas—come out
slowly, as if suffering from cramp and rheumatism, and grumbling
all the time (no wonder I), are, some of them, hidden away inside,
while the weakest of all, physically unable to secure inside places,
are hoisted up aloft, where the rain will finish them, I should say.
Oh, the pleasures of touring!
We can have one open trap with two horses and driver. It is a
waggonette; and, wrapped up in waterproof capes, coats, and caps,
with a waterproof rug over our knees, we pack ourselves inside. Off
we go. What a day! Rain pelting on us, and driving at us! Gusts
of wind which threaten to stop the horses with a facer and to knock
the driver backwards on to the rug that's over our knees. Ford-
Bahlt repeats, more than once, and quite pleasantly, that "This is
the very sort of day for seeing the Pass." But he buries himself in
his cape and sou'-wester, and not until there is a lull of five minutes
does his head emerge. Melleville is the only one who braves the
storm, in a yachting cap, a high waterproof collar touching his ears,
and his pince-nez defying the elements. The Composer has disap-
peared, and admires as much as he can of the scenery through the
top button-hole of his mackintosh.
For my own protection I have a blaok waterproof, a cap of the
same material, with a curtain all round it, fastening under the chin.
When thus arrayed, I look like the Black Knight (waterproofed) in
Ivanhoe. It is effective, theoretically; but though it protects the
ears, it strikes so intensely cold a-top, that I feel as if I were going
about with a wet sponge on the crown of my head; and as the wind
will blow up between the fastenings of the cape, I find myself sitting
in a system of thorough draughts; while the stuff being the most
expensive and of the very lightest texture, so as to allow it to be
called a " pocket waterproof, or some delusive name of that sort, has
invariably gone with a rent—like a Land-Leaguing tenant—when-
ever the slightest opposition has been offered by my accidentally
treading on the skirt as I am mounting anywhere, or by my catching
on something sharp—a very unpleasant situation—as I am descend-
ing, say from the yacht into the gig, and so there are two or three
fanoy openings not included in the original bargain, and an aperture
just below the middle of my back which takes in as much water as
a portion of my under-coat can conveniently carry. However, we
are all in the same boat—the only occasion when we are not in the
same boat, by the way, but all in the same carriage, and we try to
come out as Mark Tapleys, and be at our very best and jovialest.
The driver keeps his head down, as if he were butting at the
weather with his hat, and volunteers no information. Presumably,
he is the guide, so being all pretty well up in our Mckray's History
of the Pass of Glenooe, we determine to obtain more precise details on
the spot. _ The Composer, who thinks there is a fine subject here for
a Dramatic Cantata, after carefully sheltering himself with his leit
arm holding a bit of his big cape as if he were afraid that the driver
was going to turn round and hit him, looks up obliquely, and asks,
"IsrTt this where the Mac Ian P &o." To which the driver, slightly
turning his head towards Culllns, only replies, quietly, "Aye, Sir."
Melleville sees a ruin, whioh must have some connection with
the awful story of Glenooe. "Is that," he asks the driver, "Is that
where Hamilton, &c, &o." And again the driver most civilly
replies, " Aye, Sir, yes." He confirms all our guesses, which proves
to us how thoroughly we have mastered the history of the plaoe and
its geography. We drive on for some time: asking various questions
and receiving the same unvarying answer. At last it occurs to me
that either the driver wants to get the journey over, and is there-
fore uncommunicative, or that he is not quite so well up in the subject
as we are. So, when we arrive at the most desolate, and most awe-
inspiring part of the Glen, I ask him, in quite a matter-of-fact tone,
"Does the band play here every evening P '* He turns round sharply
with a suspicious " Eh P" and I repeat the question gravely. "No,
he answers, hesitatingly, regarding me askance, "No, there's no band
Slays here." "But, I continue, as if astonished at his reply, "how
o they amuse themselves here, then P Aren't there any theatres, or
concerts, or fireworks P"
He looks down at me over his shoulder, considers awhile as if try-
ing to remember whether he had ever heard of the existence of
these entertainments in the Pass of Glenooe, and then he replies,
slowly, "No. There are no theayters; no." Then, evidently thinking
it necessary to make a clean breast of it, ana apologise for his
ignorance, he turns quite round and says, ingenuously, "You see.
Sir, I'm a stranger in these parts, and this is the first time as ever I
was here at all."
He has appealed to our compassion; he is only a servant: the hotel
proprietor sent him with us, as we wanted a carriage to ourselves.
Melleville inquires, " Can you tell us whether we've seen the whole
Pass, and ought to turn back P" "No," he sadly shakes his head,

he had been rather trusting to us, as we seemed to know all about it.
Does he know where we are now? Not a bit; he is humbled and
cast down, and so to speak, throws himself on our mercy, and hopes
we won't shoot him. "Has he never heard," asks the Composer,
coming right up on end, as it were, like a Jack-in-the-box, suddenly,
and displaying the most vigorous indignation, "Has he never heard
of the Massacre of Glenooe f" No, the driver hasn't; this is, he
abjectly repeats, most abjectly, the first time he's ever been here;
but if we like he '11 ask where it is (meaning the Massacre, which he
probably thinks is the name of a house of call on the road) as we go
back.
*•••«*
Storm increased. A heavy sea on in Loch Leven. The gig is
pitched and tossed, so that we have to hold on tight when we get
alongside the yacht, and the gig is shot up in the air high enough to
bump against the other boat suspended on the davits, and then comes
down again with a whop into the waves. We have each separately
to choose our moment for being chucked up in turn on to the deck,
where we are caught in the arms of the Captain and First Mate.
Dinner compensates for all; and, full of Glencoe and its horrors,
we drink confusion to the memory of William the Dutchman, and
wish he had been the Flying Dutchman, and contusion generally to
the memory of everyone who had a hand in that diabolical work.
Next Morning.—Another dramatic change. It is still pouring.
We purpose fishing. All are dressed as I)irk Hatteraicks, when
suddenly out comes sun, up dries deck, a fair wind, a lovely day, off
go waterproofs, and we are once more in ordinary costume and under
weigh.
To Canna, to shoot the seals. Progressing beautifully. Suddenly
the Composer comes below, and, with a disturbed expression of coun-
tenance, reports that the Captain, in reply to a question about Canna,
has said that " he canna go." This is not a joke it appears, but a
fact. There are nautical reasons which I am unable to comprehend;
but whatever they may be, they do not quite satisfy Melleville,
who is clearly annoyed.; Fokd-Bamly looks solemn, the Composer
bewails his ill-luck in being a second time done out of shooting
seals—by which sport I rather fancy he entertained some visionary
hopes of making a large fortune, and retiring for life,—and I,
taking it philosophically, begin to inspect my maps and see where I
will go to instead of Canna for the remainder of a short holiday.
The Yacht's course is altered. We are going South. I elect to be
set down in Lamlash Bay, off Arran, thence by steamer to the main-
land, then, via Kilmarnock and Carlisle, up to London, and then by
Dover and Calais to Mayence, to come down the Rhine and see how
it looks immediately after a fortnight among the Scottish Isles.
For one night we put [up in Lowlander's Bay, pronounced Lolo-
man'a Bay, which I well remember on a former ocoasion. The Com-
poser has not yet written that song about Loloman's Bay, which was
to have handed his name down to posterity, as Dibdin Junior. He
has chosen his beautiful subjects, "Lohmarit Bay" and the
"Spinnaker Boom." He says the sort of thing he wants—"Dibdin
wrote his own words," he reminds me—is this:—
The Frenchmen (or any other people if this isn't popular) came down in
territic array,
To fight with the British in Loloman's Bay—Loloman's Bay;
To fight with our sea-dogs in Loloman's Bay.
We none of us care about the introduction of "sea-dogs" and
"British," but the Composer says it is only the idea of the sort of
thing required, and that the finish should be :—
"The moon was full up when we got under weigh,
And left all the Frenchmen in Loloman's Bay."
He thinks it would do for Sims Reeves or Santley. More chance
as a Baritone for Santlby, as Sims Reeves seems to stick to " The
Bay of Biscay " and " Tom Bowline." The "Spinnaker Boom"
he would treat heroically, thus:—
He—anybody—a pirate or buccaneer, the Composer explains—" it
doesn't matter who 'He' is." We agree that it doesn't, and the
Composer recommences:—
"He bounded on deck little knowing his doom,
So I knocked him flat down with the Spinnaker Boom."
"It couldn't be done," objects Fobd-Bamly, in a matter-of-fact
way.
I don't say it could," retorts the Composer. "I'm only giving
you the idea of the sort of verses I want to compose for." Then he
goes on:—
"They buried him sadly, and wrote on his tomb,
'Just killed by a blow from the Spinnaker Boom.'"
Ctjlltus then gives us several specimens of the kind of music he
will write for the song when finished. We join in a chorus, and,
having had a musical evening, all retire, humming.
Sailing all Night.—Beating about the Mull of Cantyre. At mid-
night I go on deck to see a phantom ship in full sail passing us.
Strange and weird sight. It looks like three fiendish giants Bailing
along on the back of a monster duck, whioh had been badly wounded
in the middle of the body, where it exhibited a bright red mark that
seemed to tingethe sea as it went by slowly and silently.

Phantom Shapes at Sea.
After this—and rather expecting the Sea Serpent to follow—I
retire. But not to rest; oh dear, no. The Mull of Cantyre says
sleep no more. Never was such a Mull! No sooner am I dropping
off than I hear the word '"Bout!"—and about we go-flopping,
rolling, then pitching, heaving, banging, whopping. I am nearly
out of my berth: I clutch at the side. Just beginning to think that
I can at last get some sleep, when 'bout we go again, and I am rolled
over on to the other side. After four turns, I get up, fall out some-
how, and attempt to re-make the bed. It is a struggle: but I think I
have made a slight improvement. I bide my time, and then in again,
holding on. No distinct notion till to-night of what " taking forty
winks" meant. I never got more sleep than this graphically describes,
for I never suoceeded in keeping my eyes olosed—the seconds of rest
were literally " winks." "Wink, I am aware, is the abbreviated
form of "periwinkle," and just time to take forty winks might
have come to mean, nautically, the time occupied in extracting that
number of winks out of their shells with a pin—a tedious operation,
which I should say would rather represent a period of forty minutes.
I only wish that in this sense I could get forty winks. But it is im-
possible. We are on "short tacks" all night, and eaoh short tack
is like a nail driven into my coffin.
I make up my bed five times to-night, and on each ocoasion it is
rather worse than it was before. I remember the proverb( "As you
make your hed, so you must lie on it," and appreciate it thoroughly.
"Lie on it" I may, and must—but to sleep on it is an impossibility.
Mull of Can tire, indeed! It evidently can tire me!
At last, about seven a.m., I fall asleep, and dream that I am in an
old-fashioned four-post bedstead; then, somehow, going through no
walls or doors, but merely " somehow," I am wafted through the air,
still in night-attire, among branches of trees, at which I clutch occa-
sionally, until I find myself fluttering above the heads of some people
on to an old-fashioned landing outside the room where I am supposed
to be asleep in the old-fashioned four-poster. Then someone coming
up-stairs; a chambermaid, I think, who holds her hands before her
face, as if inexpressibly shocked, whioh quite astonishes me up in
the air, exclaims, "How can you, Sir! You ought to be ashamed of
yourself!" and I am about to explain that it is no fault of mine that
I am flying about in this costume, and that I wouldn't of my own
accord offend anyone's feelings for worlds, when somebody else says,
"Half-past seven, hot-water, Sir," and, opening my eyes, I see the
Steward. He informs me that we are very much where we have been
for the last five hours, but that breakfast will be as usual. It isn't
as usual, as we form acute angles to the table, and are in generally
uncomfortable and absurd positions. However, wind and tide serve
our turn at last, and, about ten hours or so later than we had expected,
we come to an anchor in Lamlash Bay, and go on shore to inspect that
lively watering-place. Scotch weather set in: more rain, more Mac-
intoshes, and more Maomisery. The pier of Lamlash in the rain,
with luggage, damp passengers, cattle, cattle-drivers, boatmen, and
baggage, is a delightful plaoe—specially for Ladies. But, Farewell,
Bonnie Scotland! Away to foreign shores!
Parnell and his Flank.
"My Programme has only one Plank," Bays Pabnell,
'' And that's Independence." Delightfully frank!
But in old Naval days,—some remember them well,—
The Mutineer's doom was called " Walking the Plank "!

THE IRISH "VAMPIRE."
"The Vampire Bat (V. Spectrum), hovering over its victim with quiver-
ing wings, descends and fans him gently aa it breaks his skin and draws his
life-blood."
Poob Erin! Ghoul-beset and harpy-haunted
Has been thy path, pale victim, from the first.
Undying charms by many singers ohaunted
Are thine, but shadowed by some spell accurst.
By foe beset, by friend betrayed for ever;
Deceived when trusting, and when hostile foiled;
In thy hot haste discriminating never,
And through thy love despoiled!
Suooubus stealth and vampire greed united,
Now in new shape thy troubled drowse molest;
Sad semi-sleep by visions dire affrighted;
Pallid prostration not akin to rest.
The fatal fanning of perfidious pinions
Lull thee to opiate slumber, whilst beneath
Sinister stupor's deadliest of dominions
Creeps on the eruel death.
Wake, pained sleeper, for that fiendish'nutter
Of harpy wings preludeth not repose,
Bnt subtle life-sap and exhaustion utter!
Those winnowing bat-wings are thy ruthless foes,
Lulling but lethal. Wake, and banish quickly
The hideous death that o'er thee hovering hangs,
Before there comes, through night-fears mustering thickly,
The piercing of the fangs.
'Twill suck thy strength's last remnants; drain the sources
Of beauty left thee after many tears:
Arrest the rallying of thy long-strained forces.
The orescent brightness of the coming years
Those ghoulish wings eclipse; beneath them languish t
Late quickening hopes—they faint, they fail, they die.
Rouse, Erin, rouse from this dread dream s dull anguish,
And bid the Vampire fly!
A TIP TO STATISTICIANS.
Ik the interest of the Public Health, Mr. Punch considers that
we want a new sort of statistics. We are instructed as to the Death
Rate, and the comparative prevalence of different diseases. But as
regards the real origin of disease, and the actual cause of death, we
are generally very much in the dark. The number of deaths from
rheumatio affections there are means of discovering. But who can
tell us what proportion of these are due—for example—to damp and
draughty Hansoms P If this information could be made public, we
might, perhaps, not have to wait until the Greek Kalends—as we
seem likely to have to do in present circumstances—for that simple
but long-delayed boon, a clean, comfortable, and non-homicidal
Cab 1 This is only one instance. The wide range and the practical
advantage of such statistics must be immediately obvious. They
would be an invaluable weapon in the hand of the practical re-
former. Fancy such an announcement as this, "Forty deaths in a
week from damp cab-cushions," or untrapped drains, or draughty
theatres, or "doctored" drinks, or jerry-built houses, or bad
milk, or any one of a hundred other remediable mischiefs! How
it would set the public talking, the reformers investigating, and
the inventors scheming! Here s a chance for the men of tables
and averages, and particularly for the "passionate statistician,"
Mr. Goschen I

Yet he bullies John Bull, and his optics up-bungs.

NEITHER FOE CHOICE.
Iir view of the approaching Election of School Board Candidates,
the following correspondence, continued from a daily paper, will he
read with interest:—
Sib,—In reply to " An Inquiring Colossus," who would be " glad
to know that every child in need of education could be furnished, if
necessary, with a couple of seats and an arm-chair, at every Board
School in the three Kingdoms," 1 have only to ask him whether he
thinks the intelligent British Ratepayer will stand any outlay for ad-
dition to the already superabundant accommodation provided to meet
all the educational necessities of the country. Why, Sir, what do
statistics show? Take the Board School for this Distriot. Here we
have a magnificent Hall, luxuriously appointed, and supplied with,
I am informed, a staff of eminent native and foreign professors, three-
fourths of which is occupied daily by empty benches. And yet there
is a clamour for still further accommodation. Now, if I had my way
I would that up and sell all this useless educational lumber, ana tack
the proceeds on to the credit side of the local rates. What is the
meaning of it all? I ask. Where are we drifting to P Mr. Cham-
berlain wants all education free. Well, I would have it free; free
for the parents to leave it or let it alone, and until some move is
made in this direction, and soon there must be, it is clear there will
be no peace for Yours indignantly.
A British Ratepayer.
Sir.—I have read with some interest the correspondence that has
already appeared on the subject of the London School Board Ex-
penditure, and, as one who has taken an active part in the discussion
of the various measures that have come up before that body from
time to time for deliberation, I may perhaps be permitted to speak
with some authority on the subject. It is not true, as your Corre-
spondent "One-and-Tenpence rrr the Pound," asserts, that this
sum is the limit which will be chargeable to the Ratepayer. On the
contrary, the Board has a wide and sweeping scheme in hand that
will materially raise the amount levied above that moderate figure.
Nor is it true that we are satisfied with the existing accommodation,
which is equal only to about 25 per cent, in excess of that absolutely
required. We propose authorising the erection of buildings sufficient
to provide for the wants not only of the present, but of the coming
generation, and we shall fearlessly appeal to the Ratepayers to find the
tinews for this wholesome and important work. With regard to the
appointment of a Persian Professor of double-back somersault-
throwing, at a salary of £1200 a year, I certainly voted for that
item, as I consider the physical and moral training of the young
intimately connected; and, though it was not ultimately carried, it
returned, as, with this programme, I confidently expect to be, at the
forthcoming election, I am in hopes of being able to introduce it on
some future, and more auspicious occasion,
I have the honour to be, Sir, your Obedient Servant,
An Outgoing Member of the Board.
Six,—Is there no possible medium between blind niggardliness on
the one hand, and reckless expenditure on the other, and have we no
alternative but to choose between those who would let education go
to the dogs rather than pay an extra halfpenny in the pound, and
those who would bring about the same result by making the financial
yoke intolerable? Bigger issues, in a wider sphere, happen just now
to be at stake, but when in a day or two the London Ratepayers are
called on, as they will be, to select their Educational Representatives,
let them keep their eye on the "Moderates," which is the advice of

THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.
V.—From the Depth of Despair.
Hatfield, Monthly.

eab Toby,
Anxieties, annoyances, and troubles
of various kinds nave prevented my
writing to you earlier. I suppose there
are people who, knowing that I am
Pr-me M-n-st-r, and (instead of the
ordinary hat of civilisation) go about all
day in a coronet, think I am happy!
A coronet's all very well in its way,
airy, especially at the top, and to some
people of dark and striking visage
becoming. But you have to sleep in it
at night as well as wear it by day, and
that is quite another pair of sleeves, as
we say at Chateau Cecil.
These things are a parable, dear Toby,
which your keen intelligence will unravel
and apply. The fact is, I am not the
happiest of men, and sometimes look
baok with tender longing to the time when I was still a cadet, and used to earn a
little pocket-money as a gentleman of the Press. I am popularly regarded as a
man of imperious manner, born to lead, and incapable of following. Yet, it
has happened that of late years I have been in subjection to a will stronger than
my own. There was Beaky for example. You remember how, in my young
days, I "went for" D-zzy, pouring out upon him all the bitter scorn I felt,
partly patrician and partly moral. Then he came to the front, passed us all, took
up an unassailable position, and I bowed my neck to his yoke.
That was hard to bear. But there were substantial compensations. Besides,
B-c-nsf-ld was my elder, a veteran Statesman who had slowly and laboriously
won his way into a position of command. But look you, Toby, at that young
R-nd-lpji, who has me in tow now. He is young enough to be my son, and
was in jacket and trousers when I was already a power in the State. D-zzy led
me with a certain courteous gravity. But this young man hustles me along,
first this way, then that, with an energy that leaves everything to be desired in
the matters of comfort and courtesy. One never knows where to have him. I
If he doesn't have his own way, he immediately sulks and throws out hints of |
appearing upon the platform and denouncing us, of which he is quite capable.
I live in a constant state of terror, arising from twofold conditions. In the first
place I dread Bome new escapade or demand from R-nd-lfh; beyond that is
the oonstant fear of something happening in Ireland, or a general revolt of the
Party.
The other day I had a consultation with Cr-ss and Sm-th, and submitted to
them a proposal whioh will show you how I have fallen. "Let us, my friends,"
I said, withdraw from this business, leave the country, and in some foreign
land begin afresh. Y ou, Sm-th, are a man of business, and could turn your
hand to many things. R-im-lPH himself has suggested a particular commercial
avocation for you in copartnership with Cr-88. You might run a store in the
Far West, or you'd make a capital clerk in a big hotel, or yon might open a
bookstall on the Rocky Mountains. There is the making of a capital sohool-
master in you, my R-ch-rd; or, if you could sing, you might lead a churoh
choir, or you might do for a beadle, though a little slim in figure. As for me, I
have no fear. Without further preparation I am qualified to earn fair wages in
a laboratory. I personally conduoted the fixing of the Electric light at Hatfield.
I can take photographs, and can do a little conjuring. These openings are
modest, but they will bring with them peaoe of mind, and we will never more
see R-nd-lfh. Let ns fly!"
They hesitated for .a moment and seemed inclined to
consent. It was a great price, but there was a ireat
prize. After talking it over, however, the proposal was
rejected. Cb-ss said: "R-KD-LPn will be sure to find us
out, follow us, jeer at me, suppose I got a situation as
beadle, fire squibs in Sm-th's bookstall, and play the
deuce with your laboratory." "There's nothing that
fellow isn't capable of," said Sm-th, with a little shiver.
So here we still are, fighting on under difficulties of
whioh the publio have only the slightest notion. To me
a crushing defeat at the polls would be the sign of
deliverance from a situation becoming daily more insup-
portable. I can only beg your sympathy. When you
see me upon the public platform thundering forth
anathema at the enemy, you will know that my defiant
attitude hides a breaking heart, and will drop a tear for
Your friend, and Markiss

HOW THEY SETTLED IT.
"At the moment of the departure of the Varna mail it is
rumoured that the Sultan has issued an Irade approving the
resolution of the Council of Ministers regarding the proposals
on the Egyptian Question presented by Sir H. D. Wolff, and
that His Majesty will promptly appoint a Commission in the
sense reported in my previous telegrams."—Times' Correspon-
dent at Constantinople.
It havingbeen officially intimated 'that the Mission of
Sir H. D. Wolff to Constantinople has at length come
to a favourable termination, there can be no reason why
the following, the concluding telegraphic despatches
passed between the British Commissioner and Lord
Salisbuby, should not be made publio:—
Sir II. D. W-lff, Constantinople, to Lord S-l-sb-ry,
Foreign Office, London.
This Bulgarian business has knocked the "Commis-
sion" into a cocked-hat. I can get no attention from
anyone. It was bad enough before, but now it is simply
outrageous. They don't even tell me to call again. Au
I can get from them is that "they don't know me."
This is very irritating, and renders negotiation quite im-
possible. I am prepared to try anything, but what am
I to do? Please wire instructions.
Lord S-l-sb-ry, Foreign Office, London, to Sir II. D.
W-lff, Constantinople.
Your telegram to hand. Very confusing. Not being
on the spot, cannot tell you what you are to do. Aot
within your own discretion. Meantime, hint that you
have something to say about the Bulgarian business.
Perhaps they will let you in on the strength of that.
Anyhow try, but do not compromise Her Majesty's
Government.
Sir II. D. W-lff, Constantinople, to Lord S-l-sb-ry,
Foreign Office, London.
A thousand thanks for your exoellent suggestion.
I have tried it with much effect. Tone altered at once.
I am to see Halim Pasha after luncheon. Certainly will
not compromise Her Majesty's Government. Suppose you
will have no objeotion to my promising aotive support
as against Russia, Austria, and Germany, and advising
opening of Eastern Question by an appeal to force with-
out delay. Think of threatening Greece as welL See a
fine crop of complications a-head if I follow up this
line, but am confident of the result. Sure to be satisfac-
tory. Better wire by return if you have anything to
add to this.
Lord S-l-sb-ry, Foreign Office, London, to Sir H. D.
W-lff, Constantinople.
Stop! Most unsatisfactory. You must do nothing of
the kind. Hint what you like, but don't commit Her
Majesty's Government to anything. It must reserve to
itself complete liberty of action. Pray understand this.
Let me hear from you at once.
Sir H. D. W-lff, Constantinople, to Lord S-l-sb-ry,
Foreign Office, London.
Very sorry, but your reply turned up too late. Have
settled everything on the lines indicated in my last.
Full particulars will reach you by despatch in ordinary
course. Her Majesty's Government only slightly compro-
mised. Never mind. Worth the candle. Three
for the Commission! I'm off to Cairo.

Constitution would be instantly dissolved if we agreed to abandon
the present oratorical presumption, which was that every Politician
who differed from you was an Adventurer actuated by the meanest
motives, who had only been saved by good luck from being tried for
I housebreaking, arson, and forgery, while everybody on your own Bide
I was an Angel of Light. (Sensation.) F<
ample:—he was quite | A New
sure that in advocating the compulsory purchase of land for allot-
ments, Mr. Chamberlain honestly believed that the soheme was a
practicable one, and that it involved no injustice to the owners of
land, but, on both points, he extremely regretted that he was unable
to agree with Mr. Chamberlain. (Cheers.) It was of course open to
him to say that the Radicals were only shamming sympathy with the
labourer, and that gentlemen with top-hats and black coats were by
nature debarred from knowing anything about the wants of the rural
population. (Laughter.) The first statement, however, would be
grossly unoharitable, and the seoond utterly ridioulous. (Cheers.)
No, he believed the motives of his opponents to be at least as pure
and good as his own; but he oould not help thinking that some of
their proposals were mistaken. He was rather inclined to fancy that
they were, unintentionally of oourse, raising false hopes all over the
country, but that did not seem to be a conclusive reason why he
should brand them as hypocrites, thieves, and liars. (Loud cheers,
and expressions of surprise, amid which the noble Lord resumed his
seat.)
Mr. Chamberlain, last night, addressed a large gathering of his
constituents, at Birmingham. He said :—
"I think I ought at once to put myself right with you, by saying,
that probably a great many of my views are incorrect, and most of
my facts utterly wrong. (Cries of" Oh ! oh ! "followed by cheers.) I
confess I do not pretend to infallibility in politics. You must take
my views for what they are really worth, whioh may very likely be
preoious little. (" Oh .' oh !" and laughter.) Now, having made that
admission, I think we shall get along much more comfortably. I trust
that Lord Salisbury, when he next makes one of his olever and in-
teresting speeohes, will imitate my modesty. (Cheers.) We must,
I think, acknowledge the great ability which Lord Salisbury brings
to the service of his Queen and country. (Dissent.) Nay, let us try
and give the Prime Minister his due. (Laughter.) He is, I repeat,
a man of great ability, mistaken in many things, and certainly too
dogmatic; but we must give him credit, as fair-minded men, for
having settled the Burmah Question, and half-settled the Afghan
and Egyptian difficulties, in a satisfactory manner. (" Hear, hear ! ")
What, however, you will have to decide in November is whether you
are willing to intrust the destinies of the nation to him for five or six
years, and I do not think I am going beyond the limits of courtesy
and impartiality when I say that the record of the Tory Party in the
past is not suoh as to inspire us with confidence in their reforming
zeal in the future." (Cheers.) The Right Hon. Gentleman con-
cluded by saying, that if Lord Salisbury would adopt free eduoation,
local oounoils, and compulsory sale of allotments, he, for one, would
cordially welcome the accession of a Conservative Ministry to Office
and to Power.
The meeting separated shortly afterwards in some confusion.
The Marquis of Salisbury, in the oourse of a speech delivered yes-
terday before the Brighton and South-Coast "Habitation" of the
Primrose League, remarked that there had been some dispute as to
who ought to have the credit of the passing of the Franchise Bill.
It would be easy for me." said the noble Marquis, "to maintain
that the Tories, and the Tories alone, passed that measnre through
Parliament. But then that statement would have the slight disad-
vantage of being untrue. (Laughter.) I do not understand why I
should not at once admit that we formerly opposed the extension of
the Franehite to labourers, honestly believing them to be unfitted
for a vote, but that we subsequently were reassured on this point.
If the merit of proposing the measure belongs, as I quite admit it
does, to the Liberals, the merit of not opposing it—nay, of helping it
on—belongs to the Tories. (Cheers.) I notioe that Lord Derby has
stated that the Tory Foreign Polioy would be one of 'swagger and
bloodshed.' Now, Lord Derby is a relative of my own, and as suoh
I might be expected to do what is vulgarly called 'giving it him
hot.' (Laughter.) I might say that I wondered such a statement
did not choke in his throat, hut then the remark would, I fear, be
exceedingly rude on my part. What I do say is that, acting, no
aoubt, from the best intentions, Mr. Gudstone in his Egyptian
policy was not very successful, and that, therefore, it does not he in
the mouths of Liberals to taunt us with our Foreign Poliov. (Cheers.)
At the same time 1 willingly acknowledge that Mr. Gladstone's
action in Egypt was guided bvpatrio'io motives, and that he met
with immense difficulties. ('• Hear! h<-ar.'" and "Oh.' Oh.'")
Why Bhould we not be honest and fair in these matters? We may
depend upon it, that, although a great deal is said about reform of
prootdure in Parliament, the procedure which most needs reforming
is that adopted by Members of both Houses when they are on their
Party Platforms." (Laughter and loud cheering, during which the
noble Marquis entered his " 8pecial," and returned to Town.)
Strange, but True.—Fair-play pugilists are like safety matches,
they strike only " on the box."

BOARD TO DEATH!
The following published stipulations, drawn up by a "very
moderate voter," in St. Panoras, show how keen the School Board
contest promises to he in oertain quarters. It will be seen that a
spirit of compromise has inspired their drawing up, and that they
do something more than meet the aggressive Eduoational party half-
way. They will at least be perused with interest, if not patienoe, by
distracted Ratepayers, who, at the present moment, are at a loss which
way to turn and what to vote.
1. The frontage of any additional School Board buildings shall, in
future, only be naif-dressed with Portland Stone, and the interior
accommodation provided shall not be more than 25 per cent, in excess
of that required for the district, as shown by the published statistics.
2. The Head Master and Mistress shall not enjoy an income of more,
respectively, than seven and six hundred pounds per annum, nor
shall their attendance hours be less than three hours a day for four
days in each week.
3. The Assistant Staff of Professors shall be limited to a dozen, and
no permanent provision shall be made for the teaching of the rudi-
ments of Chinese, advanced trigonometry, or Persian Calisthenics
without a special vote of the Board for the purpose.
4. No infants under three will be expected to present themselves
for eduoation, but on attaining that age their attendance will be
count- d on at all the junior classes of Physiology, Applied Soience,
and Politioal Eoonomy, and rigorously enforced by the looal agents
of the Board.
5. The proposed limit of the rate to be levied shall be fixed as low
as seven shillings and sixpence in the pound; but in the event of it
being found necessary to exceed this sum to any material extent, it
shall be competent for the members to vote for and pass the extra
amount required without any further discussion whatever.
Suoh are the " stipulations" referred to: and it is calculated that
a referenoe to their general provisions will be likely to wake the Rate-
payer to a sense of his responsibility in the forthcoming Elections.

GOOD LAWES1
While the Radicals are talking—rather loosely—about Allotments,
and the Tories joking—just as loosely—about "three acres and a
oow," Sir John Lawks has signified his intention to let out to labour-
ers and others in the Luton district portions of land varying from
twenty poles to an aore, for the growth of vegetables or farm produoe.
For the first year he will oharge only the amount of the tithe and
rates, and afterwards the allotments will be let at £2 per acre, com-
pensation for improvements being given to tenants upon quitting.
This prompt practical experimenting—very muoh the reverse of the
Lawes' delay—sounds more earnest, and therefore more hopeful, than
a great many windy promises on one side and spiteful gibes on the

playing "See the Congering Hero comes.'" The fish was after-
wards sent to the Bishop of Ely, who, the next Sunday, made an
appeal on behalf of the Suffolk Fishermen to his Conger-regation.

VIEW OF THE CORN EXCHANGE. HARD TIMES.
BOGEY!
Loud Randolph Churchill says that "if the Radical Party of
the present day were only like Mr. Bright, he should feel little fear
about the future of the country." To those who remember how
long Mr. Bright was regarded as the great Radical Bugbear, this
reads passing funny. But so scared Reaction goes its regular round
from anathema to benediction, with the monotonous regularity of a
mill-wheel or a parson's drone. In a reformer's active state he is
held up as a Bogey of violence, to frighten the timid; in his less
voloanio old age he is held up as a Bogey of virtue, to darken by
contrast the blaokness of those who are doing now what he would
have set hand to forty years ago. It is all Bogey from beginning to
end. And, forty years hence, the Churchill of the day will be
saying that, if only the advanced party of that period were like
Mr. Chamberlain, he should have no fear, &c &c, &c. If only
that muoh-talked-of " future of the country, Sir," would take on the
buckets-full of black paint—" hues of darkness and eclipse "—which
Bogeydom has from generation to generation prepared for its be-
daubment, what a tenebrifio time we should all be having, to be
sure I But it won't. The Ship of State, though, according to the
scaremongers, "built in the eclipse, and rigged with curses dark,"
persists in pointing prow towards the eternal dawn, and sailing
steadily on into the sunlight.

The question is, what ii to be the eentral ornament of the new

Why not a statue of mvself as'1 The Candidate P" Not a bad
idea. You know the statue of What 's-his-name defying the Thing
ummy—oorreot me if I am wrong. Well, I might be represented as
defying the Proprietor of the Pavilion Music Hall P Eh? Ask Sir
Frederick Leighton, he might like the subject. It would be a
companion to his, what was it? I forget—strangling the Parson—no
not the Parson—but something like it. Haven't time to write more.
Off to rehearsal. Yours heartily,

To the First Commissioner.
8ib,—With the utmost respect I would suggest that a statue of my-
self, pointing towards the Pavilion Music Hall, would be a fitting
ornament for the site. Of course, my baok will be turned on the
Criterion. Yours obediently, F. Vtt.t.tebb.
Dear Plunet, To the Same-
Rhymes with fnnky, and Monkey. But don't be funky,
and do the thing well while you are about it; that is, you know, if you
are about it. Send Boehm, or .Brock, or Tbornycroft—no Rose
without a Thorneycroft—and let one of 'em catch the writer's eye,
mine I mean. But seriously, why not a colossal equestrian statue

P.S.—I don't ride—exoept in a oab—but that's of no consequence
Sanger would lend me something quiet for the sitting. By the way,
I don't mind sitting to Horsley—but let me see, he's not a sculptor,
is he P—as I want to be represented Horsily. See? A colossal figure,
like the Duke of Wellington's, that used to be over the archway, is
better than a mere " bust up."
Drab'.Phtnkett, To the Same'
Of course you have made up your mind as to whose Statue
should grace the finest site in Europe. All that remains is to decide
in which character. I am, yours truly, Henby Irving.
To the Same.
Sir,—A really good olassioal Statue, a true work of Art, in Roman
toga—or, as my friend Mr. Pettitt says, in Roman toggery—is a
want whioh the Metropolis feels, and with which this vast London
should be at once supplied. Sir, the love of Art is implanted in our
Human Nature,—every evening 7*45 - big success. The Statue should
be heroic; a scroll should be in the right hand, labelled MS.; in the
left should be the Lease of the National Theatre; and on the pedestal
should be inBoribed, with date, &c, the magic name of Aoouvrus
Druriolant/s. Yours affably, Gua Harris.
To the Same.
Dear First Commtsioneb,
I don't like putting myself forward, but I really think
yon couldn't do better than commemorate the Inventories in the
space between the Criterion and the Pavilion, and put me up there—
I mean my effigy in marble—as being so friendly, both to theatres
and Music Halls. If you want two figures in the group, you might
tell whoever does the statue, to make it me and the Prince of Wales.
Somers Vine says he 'd like to be in this, but he must make his own
application. Yours Inventorily, Cunlippe Owen.
Dear Commissions, To the Same-
Put me up on a pedestal. I'm the representative sort of
Manager. Quite typical, a statue of me between the Criterion and the
Music Hall. Might be faring towards Alhambra—Leicester Square
way. Show me as keeping alight the sacred lamp of Burlesque,
while among the ashes of exploded tyranny lies Ash Wednesday.
The figures supporting the Ara Surlesqui might be Miss Nellie
Farrkn, Miss Kate Yadghan, Messrs. Royce and Terry. I leave
it to you—and the nation. Yours, John Hollinqshead.
New Colours.
In the aooount in the Daily News of the trousseau of the Princess
Marie of Orleans, we read :—
"A walking drets in also gray, being made of velvet, in the shade of that
colour known as ' frightened mouse.'"
This opens a fine field for a series of new colours. We shall not be
surprised to hear after this of garments "in the shade of that colour
known as"—"reproachful rat," "demented dog," "cantankerous
oat," "surprised stoat," "alarmed antelope," "timorous tortoise,"
"reflective rabbit," or " contemplative oanary."
SORROWS OF A METROPOLITAN CANDIDATE.
I have, at different times, been holding a small series of meetings
of a somewhat private and confidential character, in different parts
of the Parliamentary District whioh I hope some day to represent, and
as they consist entirely of the members of my Committee, or of their
personal friends and acquaintances, I had but little difficulty in get-
ting resolutions passed highly approving of my Candidature, which
were, of course, immediately advertised in the local journals. En-
couraged by my brilliant success on these occasions, I at length
yielded to the repeated requests of my friends, and consented to the
holding of a Public Meeting of the free and independent Eleotors,
that they might listen respectfully to my opinions upon the various
topics of the day, and then pass such an unanimous resolution of
approval as would strike terror and confusion into the ranks of my
hapless opponent.
The meeting was accordingly held last week, and while I and my
Committee were awaiting, in the ante-room, the striking of the hour
of eight, we were gratified by the pleasing information that the large
Hall was crowded with an eager, and somewhat impatient, audience.
Our entry was greeted by a most vociferous shout, but not altogether
of an unanimous oharacter, and our Chairman, a local Churchwarden,
had some difficulty in obtaining silence, calls of turn-coat, and trim-
mer, and even traitor, greeting him on his rising to speak. Whether
he lost his presence of mind at this unexpected reception, I know not,
but he caused a roar of laughter by at once informing the meeting
that his presence in the Chair was no indication of change of politics,
but was merely an act of friendship to me personally, as he quito in-
tended to vote for my opponent! He ended his very brief speech by
asking for a patient hearing for all, and then called upon me to
proceed.
My reception was certainly a staggerer. The whole meeting seemed
to take an active part in it. Cheers, Groans, Shouts, and roars of
laughter vied with each other for predominance, but I think the last
won it hollow. They certainly were the best-natured crowd I ever
saw collected together, and almost everything that I said was oheered
so vociferously that I had some slight doubts of its sincerity, but of
the heartiness of the laughter there could be none. All the great
points that my guide, philosopher, and agent had prepared for me,
and which I had taken suoh immense pains to learn by heart, got
mixed up so unmercifully that I found myself denouncing Hereditary
Vaccination, and Home Rule for Women, and pledging myself un-
reservedly to support Local Option in Land, and Enfranchisement of
Freeholds. How they did roar I I should doubt if a publio speech
was ever more thoroughly enjoyed, and I am not at all sure that if a
vote of confidence had been proposed immediately on the conclusion
of the peroration of my speech—in whioh, by some strange confusion
of ideas, I compared Lord Randolph Chamberlain to the Lord
Mayor of ancient days sitting amid the ruins of exploded cartridges
—it would not have been carried unanimously with the shouts of
laughter amid whioh I resumed my seat.
But, unfortunately, no sooner had the laughter and noise subsided
than the questioning began, and for some three-quarters of an hour
I was subjected to sunh a severe cross-examination as I was by no
means prepared for. I think I should have broken down altogether
and retired ignominiously from the platform, but my experienced
agent had placed some of my strongest supporters—among them being
my butcher and my grocer—in oonspiouous plaoes, and who, when I
was unduly pressed, changed the subject by shouting out some ques-
tion on whioh I was quite sound, whioh enabled me to recover myself.
I think that, without any exception, this was the longest three-
quarters of an hour I ever passed. The hands of the great clock
opposite to me seemed almost motionless.
The questions were, so to speak, hurled at me from all parts of the
room, and any hesitation on my part in replying drew forth shouts
of " No shuffling!" " Speak out like a man I" "Where's your back-
bone P" till I was fairly bewildered, and doubtless gave some ourious
answers, which again drew forth shouts of laughter, but a good deal
mixed with shouts of dissent.
Ditendowment was a terribly difficult question to deal with.
"Will you disendow the ChurohP" _ After a slight pause, "Yea,
certainly." (Cheers.) "Will you disendow the Livery Companies
of the City r" As I have the distinguished honour of being a
Warden of the Worshipful Company of Bellowsmenders, which gives
me a revenue of about £300 a year and oertain privileges of a most
enjoyable oharaoter, I naturally hesitated, amid screams of derision,
and then said, "Yes, I think so." "How long have you thought
so P " shouted a stentorian voice. "I cannot exaotly say. Possibly
not very long," I replied; "hut Rome was not built in a day." This
happy idea, as I then thought it, failed lamentably, and was received
with another roar. I draw a veil over the further proceedings,
exoept to announce that, upon a show of hands being taken, my
oandidature was condemned by a majority of about two to

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BOULONACO-SUR-CHEMIN-DE-FER.
(By a Remorseful Loser of Seven Francs.)
"When Eastend-on-Mud was described in these columns it was
imagined that the plaoe was unique. The impression was a false
one, inasmuch as the Frenoh town—a thousand pardons, city—under
present consideration, has the same foundation as the plucky little
Esjex watering-place, which tries so hard to escape from the river to
the sea. Both Eastend and Boulonaco, especially at low tide, are
famous for mud. Years ago it was almost impossible to live in the
latter on account of the imperfect drainage, and now and again a
fearful epidemio has left the visitors' list a vacant page. In those
far-off days Boulonaco was a sort of sea-side branoh of the Fleet and
other debtors'prisons, and the resort of bold outlaws who had bravely
cozened the Queen's subjects out of their money. These gallant
trippers (in more senses than one) were wont to swagger down the
pier on the week days, reserving Sunday for an occasional excursion
to England, under the protection of a law forbidding their arrest on
the Sabbath. Near the sea was a little "Etablissement," built of
wood, where balls were held twioe or thrioe a week (the one given on
Fridays being particularly grand — a large balcony being then
annexed by a red and white awning to the dancing saloon), and
icarti and whist permitted at points not exceeding half a franc
The place was paved with rough-pointed stones, and visitors, instead
of living at hotels, resided at boarding-houses.
Thirty years pass, and what a change! First of all—about the
mud? New harbour works have nearly concealed it. Nowadays the
terrible spectre of disease that invariably aocompanied low tide is
completely laid. The onoe open sewer is closed, it is to be hoped,
for ever. Next, as to the streets, gas has taken the place of oil,
asphalt* of jagged stones, and tram-oars of broken-down diligences.
An omnibus, started by the "enterprise" of somebody or other
(who proudly gave the conveyance his name), used to run ten years
ago between the fish-market and "the Etablissement," but now this
has been replaced by carriages on rails of the familiar English pat-
tern, which perambulate the town in all directions. The hotels are
numerous and good, from the " Napoleon," built in the days of the
Empire (when Boulonaoo prospered greatly, and consequently has
ever since been intensely Republican), down or up to the "Be
Mouton," with its glazed galerie, looking like a shopless Burlington
Arcade, turned into a number of extra-sized inhabitable dolls'-
houses, with transparent" fronts," for the benefit of summer visitors.
And, last of all, about the Etablissement t
Alas! the Etablissement exists no longer ) The old wooden build-
ing has long since been swept away, and with it the red and white
curtains and the open balcony. In its place has arisen a majestic
building of the true Parisian type, exterior, stucco and plate-glass—
interior, red velvet, gold pillars, and glittering chandeliers. A
small piece of garden, which in the olden days was full of sea-side
evergreens, has been enlarged into "park-like grounds," with a
kiosk for the band in the centre. Between the new building and
the sea was established a " Sckating Rink," and a children's play-
ground, and as an annexe, appeared an exceedingly good Aquarium.
Thus the Etablissement, until a few months ago. Now a greater,
and probably final, alteration has been effeoted—the name is changed—
it is no longer the " Etablissement," it is now the " Casino." A
"Jardin d 'hiver " has ooonpied the Aquarium—the children's play-
ground has vanished into space—the once splendid saloons have been
out up into a smallish theatre, and a suite of rooms used for other
purposes than the circulation of society—the allusion to the suite of
rooms is a sad one, for their recent addition warrants the new name
"Boulonaoo" (so suggestive of another plaoe with the same final
dissyllable) whioh appropriately identifies the pleasantest of Frenoh
watering-places.
When the city was in its " baby rowdyism," when imprisonment
for debt was a stern reality in England, there used to be an "inno-
oent game " played at the Etablissement, in whioh a top and nine pins
figured, and at whioh the gamblers (who paid a few sous as entranoe-
money) won toy prizes. That "top ana skittles" arrangement has
so developed, that this year Boulonaco has been little better than a
"Riviera health-resort. The "suite of rooms" are given over
entirely to gambling—real substantial gambling.
During the past season a show of seoresy was made about the
"Cercle ' or inner centre where baccarat and kindred games were
played by " Members only," but now that October has come and the
balk of visitors departed, the regulations are relaxed, and all may
freely circulate in the suite of gaming rooms. The less enterprising
still prefer "Chemin-de-fer}" with its half-franc and five franc
stakes, to the more costly distraotions."
It is said that the Proprietor obtained the concession to use the
Tables from the Minister of the Interior himself, on condition that
other French watering-places did not oomplain. But the moment
Boulonaco commenced operations Troneppe and Diville jealously
grumbled, and a circular condemning sea-side gambling was issued,
nt this offioial "recommendation does not appear to have had I
muoh effect. The visitors stake their money (sometimes using
"Cerclt" counters, proving that the two institutions, the Club ana
the "Chemin-de-fer," are practioally the same) on the "Diso,"
"Londres," "Lisbonne," and "St. Petersbourg," or buy the privi-
lege of holding the bank with as much facility as ever. The com-
pany recalls many a meeting at Baden-Baden or Hombourg, when
Baden-Baden and Hombourg were respectively Hombourg and Baden-
Baden. Lace, diamonds, and pyramidical hats appear everywhere.
The fair-haired lady, the brunette, the Maltese have eaoh a repre-
sentative. The cries are the same, the croupiers do similar work,
the atmosphere is unchanged. To sum up (for the time for con-
cluding this artiole has arrived), the Republic and the Principality

A FALSE ALARM.
Tooetiteb, wild and scant of wit,
The scared OwJs in the belfry sit;
Four feathery flustered flapping things,
With rounding eyes and rustling wings.
Church Owls, that in that belfry long
Have heard the big bell's loud ding-dong,
Unmoved, unmaztd, by day or night,
But now are rilled with sore affright,
And Beem to hear in its dull boom
Sounds of alarm and knells of doom.
Tuwhit tuwhoo! Tuwhit tuwhoo! I
Was ever heard such hullaballoo?
Tuwhoo tuwhit! Tuwhoo tuwhit!!
Those orbs with f rantio fire are lit.
The belfry's firm, the belfry's high,
Pinnacled safe in the sombre sky,
And there, in defiance of wind and weather,
These Owls, and fowls of a similar feather,
For generations have Hooked together.
What availeth it, what doth it boot,
In clamorous chorus to shriek and hoot?
Find they, fear thev, these feathered people,
Imminent peril to Church or steeple?
Churoh in danger! Foolishest cry I
O feathery creatures of fearsome eye,
Minerva's self, were the goddess by,
Her favourite fowls would mock and chide,
Their fuss contemn and their fears deride.
Horned Owl, with the throat of black,
You should know better! The bird at your
back.
Grey-polled, goggle-eyed, easily scared,
Is always frighted if light is flared
Full in his optics, that love the dark,
But you t The belfry has been an ark
For many a flight of your fellow fowls.
What generations of oozy Owls
Have nested there, and hooted shrilly,
In fright as unprovoked as silly
At fancied prospect of coming woe,
Of tower prostrate and spire laid low I
Yet here you huddle in safety still.
But filling the night with your hootings shrill.
Tuwhit tuwhoo! What a to-do I
Tuwhoo tuwhit! Flutter and flit!
Shriek and scuffle, scurry and squall.
As though the belfry shook to its fall I
Sound the alarm on your lofty perch,
As though an earthquake menaced the

An old, old story! A stale, stale scare!
The countryfolk, lifting an eye in air,
Say, a; they pass with a smile of disdain,
"Those foolish old birds, they are at it
again 1"
A false alarm! There are some who suspect
That a very sly plan in the shine they
deteot;
That the shrill tuwhits and the hollow
tuwhoos
Are to beat up their friends and to baffle their
foes;
That those gogglesome birds in their belfry
high
Are awake to the worth of a capital cry;
That, in spite of their ohorus of souffle and
scream,
Thote Oiclt are not half to alarmed at they

A SANITARY SAGE.
The Mayor of Southwold is a bold man.
The water supply of that pleasant seaside
resort is notoriously bad, and some of the
wells are dangerously near cess-pools. It
was proposed, then, at a reoent meeting of
the Corporation, to sanction the ereotion of
water-works, and it was suggested that the
water should be analysed. Thereupon the
Mayor said that "he had not the slightest
confidence in any analysis because they might
send samples of the same water to two ana-
lysts, and get different opinions." He also
added, with reference to the wells being
injured by their olose proximity to oess-pools,
that it might be the oase or not. Truly a
courageous man this, though possibly a little
behind the times. For this is the nineteenth
century, and epidemics of typhoid fever are
not unknown, while we have been trying to
teach even children the rudiments of sanitary
science. And yet the Mayor of Southwold
expresses a rooted distrust of analysts, and
apparently has a penchant for water contami-
nated by sewage, which, as one of his col-
leagues in the Corporation sarcastically
remarked, had " a great deal of body in it."

THE BATTLE OF THE BAGGAGE.
The " Luggage Scramble " that has heen latterly occupying public
attention in the columns of a contemporary, has provoked the Bub-
joined further correspondence:—
_8lr,—There is only one course open to a " Timid Inquirer," if he
wishes to secure his luggage on his arrival at a London Terminus.
He must travel up to Town either in the society of a professional
prize-fighter, or accompanied by several roughs who will be prepared
to stand by him, shoulder to shoulder, when he enters the general
melee on the platform, and the moment the train stops he must dash
into the thick of it in the neighbourhood of the luggage-van, and
make for his individual packages. If these are numerous, he will
find it hot work, and may require to have recourse to a deal of hit ting-
out, but it is the only way. I am a frequent passenger up to Town,
and can speak with some experience; and only last Tuesday, on
arriving at Paddington, I managed to point out and carry off to my
four-wheeler seven boxes in as many minutes, with no more damage
than a couple of black eyes and a dislocated shoulder. I might have
fared worse had it not been. for the presence of a sporting Baronet
and a Colonel of Dragoons, who happened to be travelling in the same
train, and lent me a little kindly assistance in getting my things
clear of the barrier. "Looking on expeotantly," whioh appears to
be a "Timid Inquirer's" recipe, though it does not seem to have
prooured him his luggage, will not certainly suit
Yours self-helpfully, The Man who won't Wait,
Sib,—Your Correspondent, "A Dispersed Three Hundred-
weight," who arrived at a Central London Terminus on last Thursday
week, and has not yet succeeded in collecting his thirteen packages,
should take a leaf out of my book. I have been in the habit of
travelling with a considerable quantity of luggage, and have often
run up to Town by the Flying Dustman, and for some time have
counted myself fortunate if I have managed the journey with the
loss of merely one or two portmanteaus. Things, however, getting a
little worse last Christmas, when on one occasion, owing to the
feneral rush and scramble, I was unable to secure any of my effects,
devised a plan whioh I have since carried out with every success.
I have had my boxes labelled conspicuously, " Dynamite—With Great
Care." The result has invariably been that after the struggling
crowd has cleared off. my luggage has remained untouched upon the
platform. The label has then attracted the attention of the In-
spector, and I have been given, as a matter of course, into custody
and taken, with my luggage, to the nearest Police Station, where a
careful examination has soon discovered my ruse. Though there may
have been some slight delay in the process, yet I have invariably
found it successful, and can confidently recommend it to anyone who
wishes to make sure of receiving his luggage on arrival at a London
Terminus.—Yours, &c, A Thoughtful Traveller.
Sir,—The only safe method of being able to secure your luggage
at the end of a journey is to take it all into the carriage with you.
This I invariably do, and the way I effect it is by packing all my
things in egg-boxes. Four of these, six feet long and ten inches by
sixteen respectively in breadth and height, are easily crammed into
an ordinary compartment, and though, as they cover the whole floor
and entirely monopolise and fill both the hanging nets, some of the
other passengers may possibly complain, a little good-humoured badi-
nage, spioed with firmness, generally suffices to overcome all objection.
Care should be taken that the boxes fixed aloft do not, as sometimes
will happen, come down on the heads of the other occupants of the
carriage, but even with this drawback, the advantage of having your
things immediately under your hand, at the end of a journey, is so
obvious, as to render their doing so a matter of comparatively
secondary importance. Five or six luggage-porters simultaneously
hailed on the arrival of the train, and with a little pushing the
transitu* of the luggage is effected with marvellous speed, and con-
venience. I have the honour to be your obedient servant,
Practical.
Sir,—I have read the Correspondence on the so-called " Scramble"
for Luggage at the London and other large railway termini, and am
at a loss to understand the difficulty of whioh the writers complain.
They have only to follow my plan, which is simplicity itself. Before
they start let them have their boxes painted, straps and all, some
bright primary colour, say emerald-green, and let the owner of this
luggage wear a light overcoat of the same hue. On alighting on the
arrival platform, the peculiarity of his dress instantly will attract
the attention of several porters, to whom he oan announce the faot
that his particular paokages are similarly coloured, and while doing
so he can at the same time produce and toy with a wt 11-tilled purse.
In a few minutes he will find himself in a cab with all his effects
about him. At least suoh has been the experience of
aopeiuuy,
A DirLOMATIST.
Sir,—Till every passenger is allowed to travel seated on his own
luggage, and have it swiftly and civilly transferred to his cab for
him on the instant of arrival, there is only one course open to a
British traveller, and that is, to take no luggage with him at all.
At least that is the conclusion to which I have oome; and 1 oan only
advise all those who value the avoidance of a street-row to follow my
example, and have their things transmitted after them, as I do mine,
by Parcels Post. Twenty seven-pound paokages will be found ample
for one person, and though there may be some inconvenience in
postage and delivery, yet it is not for a moment to be weighed against
the annoyance and indignation experienced by one who has been in,
but is now, he trusts, for ever Out of the Scramble.
THE PICTUEE PAPERS.
The Illustrated London News outdid itself last week with its
picture in colours (limited) of " The Royal Stag Hounds" showing
His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales taking off his hat to a little
boy blue mounted on a curious sort of animal, presumably a
pony, with the object apparently of showing how beautifully his hair
has been arranged this morning—done in oils, and quite an advertise-
ment for II.R.H.'s coiffeur. H.R.H. is represented as having gone
through a severe course of '' Banting "— so elegant has the artist made
his figure—and wearing such marvellously tight-fitting breeches, with-
out a sign of any button or other fastening above the boot; so that the
appearance of these immaculate and creaseless hunting breeches
reminds us of the chorus of the song popular two years ago—in the
crutch and toothpick period,—
"How did you get your trousers on?
And did they hurt you much f"
which is exactly what would occur to any right-minded sportsman
on seeing this pioture of His Royal Highness in the Illustrated
London News. If the pioture be correct in detail, then the sooner
the whole party are engaged at Sanger's or at Hengler's (where they
used to play at'Foxhunting) the better for either of these entertain-
ments and for the hunt. What torture they must suffer in that Royal
hunting get-up!" Get up,"—but how do they ever " get up " on to
their hordes in those tight fits P They must be lifted by cranes and
dropped into their saddles.
A propos of Illustrated Papers, the fun of the original photos is
entirely lost, without an explanation underneath, in the reproduction
of " Reading a Tragedy " and " The Elopement in the Sporting and
Dramatic. How Rapier" must envy the coloured Royal Stag
Hounds in the Illustrated! His frontispiece of Miss Phyllis
Brouobton is very nearly as charming as the original; one of the
best reproductions of a photograph we 've seen for some time. The
Illustrated Papers, as a rule, ought to give His Royal Highness a
handsome salary. Can't they let poor Royalty have a little rest just
for one week P Let's see a few numbers without any of 'em in.
The English people won't forget their existence.
What we hope will be Mb. Winans' Maxim before long.—
The " game " is not worth the " scandal."

REVISED VERSIONS!
(2 propos of some " Second Notices," with an entirely New and
Original Suggestion.)
Sir,—While absent on my holiday tour round the world in a
month—that is, as far as I could travel on the road in that amount of,
time and baok again—and here I may mention that I have frequently'
started for my great tour round the world, and seldom got further,
than Boulogne,—well, Sir, while away from London, no matter!
where I was, several pieces were produced, and I read what were*
intended to be first-night critioisms upon them in some of the papers.f
Now, a short while ago, a certain writer was taken to task by un-t
certain writers for expressing his opinion that it was a most difficult"
thing, if not almost an impossible one, for a theatrical critic to pro-
nounce a final verdiot on any piece from merely seeing it on <pne of
the usual unsatisfactory first nights. A first-night au4ign6e is not
an audienoe which represents the public, nor is a first-night's per-
formance of a piece, let the rehearsals have been as perfect as can be,
at all the same thing as the sixth or seventh representation of it.
So, when I gathered from these critioisms that there was not much
in the burlesque of The Vicar of Wideawakefleld, that caricatures
of Irving had been overdone, and that the parody, which some senti-
mentalists considered equivalent to sacrilege—burlesque Goldsmith's
Vicar of Wakefield forsooth!—was only saved by Miss Laura
Linden s dangerous talent of olosely imitating Miss Ellen Terry,
I said to myself, this is merely the utterance of a oritio on seeing an
imperfect hrst-night's performance; nous verront.
And what have I lately read in '' second notioes " appearing in the
same papers, and probably by the same hands f Why, that the
parody is delicately done, that Mr. Arthur Roberts as the Vicar is
very funny, and the praise given to Miss Linden is repeated, and
considerably strengthened. Having recently seen this burlesque, I
should say that as a parodied plot it is unintelligible: but as an
entertainment offering opportunities to Mr. Arthur Roberts and
Miss Laura Linden for showing how droll they can be when carica-
turing Irvino and Elien Terrq, it is very funny; but there is too
much of a good thing, and this joke is about half an hour too long.
The Jups, at the Novelty Theatre, was pronounced a disaster by
the oritics: it is, I am informed, drawing crowded houses. There
will perhaps be second notices" of this pieoe.
'The oritics, again, seeing Mr. Comyns Carr's Dark Days on the
first night, shook their heads over it, admitted the cleverness of
Mr. Beerbohme Tree's acting, but generally damned it with faint
praise. Now "second notices" have appeared. The Daily Tele-
graph critio says, in his notice, Ootober 22nd, laying it down as a
general rule, "on a first night there is invariably a tendenoy to drag.
Ominous pauses and inevitable hesitations stop that eleotricity, with-
out which no play can be wholly interesting." Let him remember
his own dictum, and be guided by it when he writes about another
first-night's performance. I hope the next play he witnesses on a
first night will be performed by "electric actors," but he must also
kindly bear in mind that the less eleotrioity in the House, the more
gas is required—specially in the criticisms or notices, or whatever
the article may be, rightly or wrongfully, stvled.
The pressure put by the public on journalists to supply the first
news is fatal to the few ohances there are of the critio's pronouncing
a just verdiot on the real merits of a piece which he sees for the first
time, and then imperfectly played. If criticisms are to direct public
taste at all, then the oritics should be considered as Grand Jurymen,
who can either throw out the bill of the play, or send it to be tried.
But, if the piece be tried, it is not their province to pronounce a verdict.
I remember a drama being damned, on its first representation, by
all the talents who sat in the seat of the scornful—I mean the Stalls
oooupied by the critios—and yet in three weeks' time the play was
"drawing the town." Then came some " second notices," and the
astute ones said that there had been alterations and emendations,

been touched, not one line of it, nor any alteration whatever made in
it. But the Scornful Ones had to justify themselves in their own
eyes. I dare say it is much the same in the present instances. A
Dramatic Author told me of a reoent case in point, but 1 forget the
name of the piece.
For my own part, as an Unprofessional Critic, I have entered into a
solemn league and covenant with myself never again to write about
a first night's performance, and only on very exceptional occasions to
be present at a premiere.
But here are my last suggestions:—1. Let there be no first-night
notice* at all. 1. Let the piece come out, and let the first night take
its chance audience just like any other night. 3. Let the publio
express its opinion by going or 'staying away. 4. Let the profes-
sional critics, who declare that they write out of pure love of the
Drntna, see a piece several times, and, after its withdrawal, let their
well-considered and then probably valuable criticisms appear, signed
boldly, as I sign this, and am, Sir, your own

THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.
VI.—Fbom the Unsleeping Pabtneb.
Birmingham, Tuesday.
a

EAE TOBT,
You will doubtless have seen some-
thing in the newspapers about my
visitors. But perhaps it would be
well if you had an authoritative
account of what passed. Just now
the newspapers (or some of them) are
pursuing me with a malignancy that
occasionally disregards truth. I am,
I suppose, about the best-abused man
in the three kingdoms. All the ani-
mosity that used to be directed against
Gl-dst-ne and Be-ght is now con-
centrated upon me. G. and B., to the
Tory mind, have become respectable
members of society, a respectability
which brings into fuller light my
vileness. I don't care very much for
this. I'm a hard hitter myself, and,
as the poet says, those who play at
bowls must expect rubbers. Still, where one has the opportunity of giving a
matter-of-fact account of a particular event it iB just as well to do so.
Well, I was on Friday morning sitting in my room at Highbury, enjoying a
peaoeful moment and a large cigar. I had been hard at work for some weeks, as
you know. Htre was a quiet day intervening, and I was in the mood to enjoy it.
I had got a new Frenoh novel, and was deep in its perusal, when I was Btartled
by the sound of heavy footfalls, and the murmur of many voioes.
"Adown the glen
March armed men,"
I observed to myself, for I have of late, in the ccurse of much speech-making,
acquired the habit of dropping into poetry,—other people's, of course. What
oould it be P Had a revolution broken out, was a Republic proclaimed, and
were these the people coming in search of their first President? Or was it some
device of the enemy? Were they about to surround the house, kidnap me, and
keep me out of the way till the General Elections were over? That course of
procedure, thoueh a little unusual, would not be out of keeping with some
remarks of the Conservatives. The other day, one of them expressed a burning
desire to see me hung, which is going a step farther than seeing me kidnapped.
It might be necessary for me to fly. But how, and whither P
Whilst I was debating these questions, the door opened, and a servant, pale
as death, with chattering teeth and hair uprisen, said, " Please, Sir, the house
is surrounded. There's tens of thousands of 'em, and they want to see you."
I will not say I was entirely unmoved, but I would not show my discomposure
before a servant. Fixing my eye-glass firmly in my right eye, I said, " Who
are the gentlemen? Rather inconvenient calling thus early in the day, and in
what appears to be considerable numbers. Did they mention their names P"
"No, Sir," said the man, "there's too many of 'em for that." "Well, ask
them to send in a few of their oards—a hundred or so. Take a hat-box with you
to put them in, and be very oivil."
The man did not seem to relish the mission. But he went off, and I was left
alone with perturbed thoughts, as you may imagine. If it was a Republican
demonstration I would send them to D-lbte. It would be just as well to see
how he got on with the Presidency before undertaking it myself. If, on the other
hand, kidnapping was meant, time was everything, and half-an-hour or so spent
in parley would afford opportunity for rescue. Again the door opened and three
men appeared on the threshold. They were in the attire of the British workman,
and had a difficulty with their caps, which they turned round and round in their
hands as if they were making something. They cer-
tainly were not very truculent in appearance. "Well,
my friends, and what do you want?" I said, pleasantly.
Their caps revolved at increased speed. They looked at
each other, each waiting for the other to speak, at last
one said: "We want work."
I saw it all now. It was the Unemployed of Birming-
ham who had in this extremely inconvenient manner
come to appeal to me, the Champion of the labouring
classes, to do something for them in the ooncrete. There
was no danger of kidnapping or embarrassment of honour
thrust upon me. Still it was well to disstmble. "And
are you alone P" I atked, in gentlest tones. "No." said
one of the men, " there's a few more'n us outside. "A
matter of five or six hundred," said another.
Then I changed my tone, and the position of my eye-
glass. "What!" I cried to the trembling deputation,
"do you mean to say that, because you cannot get work,
you march tire or six hundred strong, upon the private
residence of a gentleman, disturb his studies pursued for
the national good, cut up his lawn with hob-nail boots,
and ruffle the surface of his gravel-walks. What have I
done tbat 1 should suffer thus P I have, it is true, east,
west, north, and south, preached the doctrine of the
natural rights of the poor. But it is not one of them that
you should arise in your thousands and invest my
private house."
Muoh more of the same kind I said. The men edged
nearer and nearer the door, finally disappearing through
it, leaving me still declaiming. After a while I heard
again the tramp of many feet. But instead of advancing,
the sound was retiring. The mob had dispersed as suddenly
and swiftly as it had come up.
There, Toby, that's the simple truth of this remarkable
episode, of which there are many distorted versions

THE SILLY COMMANDER.
[A Story t>f tiu Next War according to Ac precedent.)
Colosel Rabbihictcii had been Bent, out by the Government of
the day, with the cordial consent of the Field-Marshal Commanding-
in-Chief, to suppress an expected rising of the Muffs, a number of
Dutch emigrants who had settled in British South Afrioa. On his
way to his command the gallant officer, having learned by heart all
the newspapers he had brought with him, and re-read several times
the Mess Library, found himself with absolutely nothing to do. So,
beiDg a teetotaller, and therefore unable to conscientiously indulge
in the customary distraction of an idle soldier, he took to thinking.
And he thought about every subject under the sun, and at last by
the process 01 exhaustion came to the consideration of his own pro-
fession.
"Tarnish my scabbard!" he exclaimed one day—he was far too
good a man to swear, but of course as a warrior was obliged occa-
sionally to use a little Btrong language—" tarnish my scabbard! I
have got a new ideal I will conduct this campaign on a novel
plan!"
Soon after this the Colonel arrived at the "seat of war" (he
stealthily smiled when he heard the plaoe thus described), and was
met by his subordinates. He immediately filled up the appointments
on his Staff, but in such away that murmurs were heard on all sides.
Disregarding the claims of seniority, he, in deiianoe of all precedent,
posted the right men to the right plaoes. When remonstrances
reached his ears, he turned upon his heel, smiled, and repeated to
himself, " My new idea—conducting this onmpaign on a novel plan!
Tarnish my scabbard! but I will surprise them more before I have
with it!"
And he was as good (or as bad) as his word. There was never so
strange a leader! Over and over again he set at nought the tra-
ditions of the Service. He marched along with his whole force with-
out firing a shot, thus oausing the ammunition to be praotically a
worthless incumbrance. All the Quarter-Masters were disgusted,
and the Surgeons began to forget thtir prescriptions in their unwel-
come and enforced idleness.
"Please, Colonel," said the Chief of the Staff, one morning, carry-
ing a map into the hut of his superior, "may we make a detour to
the riirht of about five miles on our line of march?"
"What for?" asked Rabbithutch, lighting a manilla cheroot.
"To attack the fort which is held, I believe, by the Muffs in some
force, Sir." And the Major showed the Colontl where he thought
the latter ought to go.
"Don't Bee there's much good in it," returned Rabbithutch.
"We can get to the enemy's Capital just as easily, whether we take
the fort or not."
"True," responded the Major, sadly, " but by not taking the fort
we shall miss a brush with the Muffs, and cur men find thtir ammu-
nition embarrassingly heavy."
"Can't help that—tbey must carry it,—we mustn't waste public
property."
And this little incident was a sample of many others. Over and
over again the Colonel refused to burn powder. It was true enough
that there was no absolute netd for fighting, yet as soldiers are fond
of their profession, this absence of human slaughttr was not exactly
popular. Indeed, the expedition did not regret its return to its
original head-quarters. As for Rabbithutch, he hurried back to
England, and soon presented himself before the Duke to report.
Well, Colonel," said H.R.H., when they were together in the
Horse Ouards portion of the War Office, "and how have things gone?"
"Capital, your Royal Highness—the men behaved admirably."
"Did they ?" exclaimed the Duke, heartily, although as a matter-
of-fact he did not much relish hearing the rank and file spoken of
before allusion had been made to the officers. "Did they, indeed!
Well, if you have got some old Sergeant-major quite past work, he
might be promoted to the rank of Junior Subaltern."
Thank you, your Royal Highness, but if I could find such a man
(and I oan't, for all my non. corns, are most efficient) I really think
he would prefer to remain respect* d in the Sergeants' Mess rather than
appear as a fish-out-of-water in the ante-room of the officers."
The Duke stared in astonishment, and bowed.
"As for my colleagues. Tommy Sabretache and"
"Tommy Sabhetachk!" exclaimed H.R.H., in tones of pained
reproaoh. "My dear Colonel, calling an officer by his Christian
name! I really cannot permit it—you know now I dislike
familiarity 1"
"I beg your pardon, Sir, but the fact is my colleagues were such
good friends, that I looked upon every one of them as a relative.
Tarnish my scabbard! they were capital fellows!"
"Tarnish your scabbard !" repeated the Royal Duke, indignantly,
"Colonel Rabbithutch, I must request you to put a guard overyour
tongue—you know how strongly—how very strongly, I object to the
use of -violent expressions of that kind."
The visitor again apologised, and then informed the illustrious
Field-Marshal that the object of the expedition had been accomplished.
—the Muffs had completely submitted.
"Glad to hear it," returned H.R.H., shortly, "and now for the
list of killed and wounded."
For the first time the Colonel hesitated.
"The fact is, vour Royal Highness, I have conducted the cam-
paign on a new plan."
Hate anything new," returned the illustrious Duke. "However,
it may be all right. And now for the list of killed and wounded."
Again the Colonel hesitated. "The fact is, your Royal Highness,
the Muffs when they saw I was in earnest, submitted. As I have told
you, I have carried out all your instructions, and been most success-
ful. On the other hand, I have no list of killed and wounded."
"No list of killed and wounded I " exclaimed His Royal Highness,
aghast.
"No; because there was no fighting."
"No fighting I" And the illustrious Duke nearly fainted.
The poor Colonel, seeing his Chief so deeply moved, tried to explain
that really and truly bloodshed had been entirely unnecessary.
"No fighting! Oh, dear me!" The Field-Marshal blushed at
finding himself using so strong and so unusual an expression. "I
never heard of Buch a thing! A campaign, and no fighting 1"
After a very painful pause, the agitated Field-Marshal managed
to ci ntrol his emotion.
"Colonel Rabbithutch," at length he commenced, " I suppose, as
you have attained the object of your appointment, we must express
| satisfaction with your exertions. But, bir," he added with severity,
"as you were good enough to adopt a new plan of your own inven-
tion, and carry out your instructions without any bloodshed—(Good
gracious 1 dear met oh, fie 1 without any bloodshed 1 Oh dear!)—of
course you won't get any promotion!"

THE YERY NEW RULES OP BILLIARDS.
Br A. Leo, Esq.
The Billiard Association of Great Britain and Ireland has just
issued some new Rules of Billiard*, but as they are ridiculously incom-
plete, we hasten to supplement them with some of our own, as
hints to players:—
1. If playing without a Marker, always keep your opponent's score,
and let him keep yours. Hs will probably score you correctly, and
you can do as y ou please with his score.
2. Always stand opposite a pooket your antagonist is aiming at,
and move ah u', while he plays; a judicious sneeze just as he strikes
has a good effeot.
3. Use ohalk to your own oue, but keep a little soap or pomatum in
your pocket for the tip of your adversary's should he put it down
during the game. This will be found especially useful at. Pool.
4. Should your adversary turn away from the table while you are
playing, and a ball goes near, but not into a pocket, it is good jJay
to convert it into a hazard with yoar hand; at the same time calling
out the score at the top of your voice. Ihis useful stroke must be
done firmly and quickly.
5. Never own to a fluke yourself, but never let vour opponent make
a good shot without muttering " Fluke!" or " What, luok 1"
6. Pot the white whenever possible, especially if it irritates your
antagonist. He should learn to keep his temper.
7. Get the Marker outof the room, and then put your score on even
when you have made nothing. This must be done very quietly. If it
is discovered, blame the Marker. He is there for the purpose.
8. When playing Pool, always pick up any money put down for
"lives," whether it is yours or not. Ton can return it, if found out;
but the people who put it down will often pay again to avoid a
wrangle, and if they don't, the proper owners ought to look better
after their money.
"Mubder IN
9. When playing Pyramids, frequently accuse your adversary of
making foul strokes. He will be obliged to give in sometimes; and
even when you are so palpably wrong that he won't stand it, the
oharge will very likely put him off his play.
10. Rule No. 4 is very useful also at Pyramids, but must be
modified for that game. In Pyramids, put any ball that you can
manage into a pocket unobserved, and a few minutes afterwards oall
attention to the score, which of course will be wrong. Then affirm
that you had forgotten to score that ball to yourself, which will be
quite true, and immediately do it.
11. Procure a few bad half-orowns, florins, &c, for Pool, aDd pay
your pool t» the Marker, i.e., do not put it in the box, or it may be
noticed. Then, when the pool is distributed, and the bad money
appears at the end, blame the Marker, as in Rule 7.
12 If you lose a "life " early in a pool, it is comparatively easy
to get it buck again by a persistent statement that the game has
been wrongly scored, and the others will often give in for the sake of
peace and quietness. As in Rules 7 and 11, lay the blame on the
Marker.
By adhering to these Rules you are sure to make money at the
game, but they will possihly not add to your popularity in the
Billiard-room. People are so jealous of exceptional skill.
Hair and Rabbit.
In a paper lately read to the Academy of Soiences at Paris by
M. Pasteuk, that illustrious savant announced that be has at length
discovered a real cure for hydrophobia. This remedy consists of a
medium of inoculation extracted from the marrow of rabbits which
have been made hydrophobic. Now then, the antidote to hydro-
phobia, instead of being, as formerly imagined, "a Hair of the dog
that bit you," is a Rabbit which dog-poison has made more rabid
than ever. In future we shall be cautions about Welsh-rabbits.

THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL' COURT.
"Comfort? Comfort soorned of "—Judges! This is truth the Poet

That at the Old Bailey comfort's the most mythical of things.
There .Dwcomfort holds high revel, makes the Jurymen his sport;
Hope abandon, ye who enter—well, the Central Criminal Court.
Hope of ease for mind or body. Purgatory here behold,
8e° its hapless viotims tortured 'twixt extremes of heat and cold;
Driven from freezing-point to fainting, packed like sardines, pushed
and prodded,
Hustled by imposing Ushers, and by Bobbies able-bodied.
Travelling by a Cheap Excursion, waiting in the mob at Drury,
Is not half so bad as being called on an Old Bailey Jury.
See the Judges. To the left, above the gas that all aslope is,
Peer the fine judicial features owned by Mr. Justice Lopes;
Hawkins next, and Fry; then Sheriffs sitting to the right; between
them
Eagle beak and lion brush—who can forget them who has seen

Glaring hard at placid Poland much as though something had vext

That phenomenal proboscis he appears inclined to snap at;

Next above beams busy Beasley, blending dignity with bustle;
Then the calmly olassio features of the great O.C., Chabxes

whether it was not the rule in most countries

subject)—and he observed that wise people
"do not put all their eggs in one basket."

THE CROCUS LEAGUE.
I' v e jest received a application of bo egstrornary a charakter that
at fast I oouldn't make hed nor tale of it. I am aoshally arkst to jine
the Committee of a new League, to be called " the Croons League I"
Of coarse I thort as how it meant the Brummagem Croons as Mr. Ciiam-
berling is so werry fond of oultiwating and of transplanting wherever
he thinks as the sue and haspect suits, but that I finds is a mere
pollytiokle hemblem, tho how true lovers of Nature can use butiful
flowers for sitch low pupperses as that I can't understand. But
my Crocus League is quite another pair of shoes, as the Cobbler said.
It is to consist of one representatif of ewery rank and ewery perfes-
sion, and ewery trade in the hole Metrolypus, and its one grate object
is to preserve to all time the immortel memmory of Sir Robert
Walpole! I natrally asks my Wisitor why I am sleeted for this
grate honner, and the estonishing reply is, beoanse of my name and
fame! It Beems that the fust rule of The Crocus League" is, that
each member must bear the onered name of Robert, so I nat rally
represents the important perfession of Waiters. Inside the envelope
as contains the inwitation is enclosed a fust list of Members as is
expected tojiue at wunce, as any unnecessary delay ensures xpulshun,
a disgrace as wood make the wery boldest turn pail.
I gives the names of a few proposed representatives, as far as I
remembers 'em, as a fair sample of the bulk, as they Bays in the com-
mershal World. Principle representative of the Government, Robert,
Markis of Salsbury, who will most probbably be elected President of
Abbytation number wun. Representative of the House of Lords,
Robert Matchbox, Wieount Sherbroox; of the Court of Haider-
men, Sir Robert Carden, Night; of the Corporation, Sir Robert
Fowler, Barrownite; of the Poets, Robert Drowning; of the Post
Office, Robert the Hunter; of the Bakers, Majer-Oen. Sir Robert
Bakes ; of the Surveyors, Robert the Driver; of the Metropolitan
Bored of Works, Robert Freeman, as did most on 'em; of the Stock
Exchange, Robert Pixley, the Bullionaire, and bo on, had hin-
fenitum, as the Frenoh says, through Buch a list of heminent men as
bears my onered name, as amost made me blnsh as I red it. To show
how sternly pertickler they is as to the name, I learns that the sleeted
representativ of the great Livery Companys was rejected on account
of his name being Roberts, whioh so wexed his haspiring sperit that
he is said to have amost cried-his eyes out on account of his extra
hess, which he at wunoe offerd to sacrifice but his prayer was rejected,
as a hinsult to his Godfathers and Godmothers who guv it him.
Upon wenturing with becumming umility to ask what was the
principle hobject of the " Crocus League " in wishing to preserve to
all time tbe memory of a gent of whom I had never heerd afore, I was
informed that he was formerly a great Statesman, who had a wunder-
fool nollidge of " Human Nature," greater even than Mr. Orgustus
Harris himself, and that be biled down all his long egsperienoe into
the noble maxim, that "Every Man has his Price!" Upon again
arsking what might have been the Price of the defunct gentleman
aforesaid, 1 was told as it was a Earldom, a goodish lot of money and
a Garter. Wen I asked why only one, I was told as the werry 'ighest
swells of the hole Country never wore but one, and that was given to
'em by the Queen's own hand, and was all covered with dimans, and
worn so as ewerybody could Bee it. I looked pretty closely at my in-
formant to see it he was in earnest, but he never even winked much
less smyled. So as he bore my gaze I bleeved him.
He then said that in acordance with the rules of the Crocus League,
I should have to state what would be about my price, before I was
elected, when I at wunce replied that I thort as I should be satisfied
with about five pound a week, a Wictoria Cross, and the permanent
Wine Wardenship of the Washnpfool Company of Wintners. He
was kind enuff to commend my moderashun, as he called it, and to
make a note of it, which made me rayther regret as I hadn't put a
better price on myself, but Such is Life! If we gets wot we arsks we
allers wishes as we had arsked for more, like the boys who sells oranges
of the Ebrew purswayshun. He further explaned to me that as the
grate Statesman afoursaid was remarkable fond of Crocusses, the
League had adopted it as their cymbal, and as they flowrished in early
Spring, the Committee had selected the fust of April as their erpro-
priate Festival Day, on which ocasion I should meet such an aas-em-
blage of th; leading sperrits of London as wood estonish me.
My brother Crocus Leaguer, before going, said as how he had for-
gotten to mention that the entrance fee to the fust 500 members
was limmeted to a paltry guinny, but wood be enormusly increased
to them as follerd, so if I wood cash up that insignificant amount, he
wood Bend me a fishal receet in.dew course. This I acordingly did.
tho' it didn't leave many behind, and I shall I expex shortly be a full
blown Committee Man of " The Crocus League " with all the rites
and priveleges thereunto belonging, including free atendanoe at
Noblemen's Park Fates and Pick Nicks, and the right to wear a full
blown Crocus on my manly bnzzom on our Festive Day! Robert.

CONCERNING CRITICS.
Dear Mr. Prscn,
1 would go even further than your admirable correspondent,
Mr. Flexible Nibbs, I would abolish the Dramatio Critic altogether.
The Manager of the Theatre Bhould write a resume" of his new piece,
as long or as short as he pleased, and this should be inserted in the
daily papers as an advertisement. The publio would then read this,
go to the theatre, and judge for themselves. I should be inclined to
do the same kind of thing with regard to books and picture-shows.
The British Publio does not require a oritio to tell it where to pur-
chase its game, its wine, or its clothing, and I take it, the B.P. is
quite as good a judge of a play, a picture, or a book, as it is of a
pheasant, a glass of claret, or a coat. Yours partially,
The Ceitic on the Hearth.
"LIFE IN LONDON HYGIENICALLY CONSIDERED."
Mb. Cantlie, who delivered a leoture bearing the above title, the
other night at Exeter Hall, must tell the truth—don't you see,
"Can't lie," ha! ha!—or we should be inclined to consider, notwith-
standing it may have been " a hundred years since the Strand had a
breath of fresh air," in spite of our breathing " sixty tons of carbon"
daily, finding bacteria in our wood pavements, and being liable to
curvature of the spine on account of the sloping footways—that
London is the healthiest city in the world. We nave not yet ob-
served a violent exodus of the inhabitants on account of these startling
disclosures, nor have we heard of any Btriking diminution in house-
rents.

In (sharp) practice a mere imposition;

Lord Chables Beresfobd made a seamanlike, if not a statesman-

finished with a Tennysonian quotation, he was "sharply ques-
tioned." No doubt he also " sharply answered ;" but this was not
recorded in the Daily Telegraph. If the questions were puzzling,
and Lord Chablks got thoroughly "riddled,"—well, he had only to
send for "the Man who Mended the Boiler," who would have
assisted him to steam away triumphantly.
CaxrELTT to Animals.—Sir, here's a oase for interference. Almost
every day may be seen a paragraph in the papers, headed " Horses

which is not alleged. Where's the S.P.CA. P

Yes, I rather think it's time that I should tread, the boards

And secure the old full'houses, and arouse the old, old roar.
I have had a longish " easy," and performers of less note,
With exaggerated action and muoh straining of the throat,
Have been bidding for top honours very palpably of late,

And I doubt if rival Pros will soon produce a smarter lot.
There 'a a Bill! The four chief items in themselves make up a Show,
And if anyone can beat it, he's a man I'd like to know;
But of course they don't exhaust me—I'm too old a hand for that.

In innumerable programmes, and in every kind of part,
Must satisfy—and weary—the best lover of his art.
So I star for the last season; but, by Jingo, I must shine;
I do not mind withdrawing, but eclipse I must decline.
Does that pose look like exhaustion f Have my top-notes lost their

THE "DAWN OF CREATION" AND PRACTICAL
POLITICS.
Oris versatile Axe-Premier has been dabbling in Theology and
Science in the Nineteenth Century. This is an excellent preparation
for his appearanoe, next week, as advertised, at the Musio Hall,
Edinburgh, where he might revive the popular ditty, " Says Aaron
to Moses." Judging only by the quotations from the article in the
Nineteenth Century, Mr. Gladstone seems, in the finish, to be
somewhat in accord with the gentleman who, on visiting the ruins
of Jupiter's Temple, politely took his hat off, explaining to his friend,
that he considered it politic to keep in with the old rigimi, as one
never knew what turn of the wheel might bring them into power
again." Is it intended for readers between the lines to gather any-
thing certain from this as to Mr. Gladstone's exact views with
regard to " Disestablishment"?
"Mavtaisx Plaisanterie," as the unhappy person said at New-
market last week, after backing Isobar and tit. Gotten. We hear
that the distinguished gentleman who lost five-and-sixpenoe over
the race has determined on selling his studs and retiring from the
Turf. We give the information for what it is worth—which is a trifle
over the value of the studs.

donkey with a bradawl. Whilst driving a donkey and barrow, hi
was seen to thrust a bradawl into the donkey's back. Mr. Chanci
sentenced the man to six weeks' imprisonment without the optioi
of a fine. The donkey is said to have been seriously injured
and doubtless felt the bradawl stuck into him a very great bore
Sentence of imprisonment and hard labour served the handicrafts
man right. But if thus it shall be done to a driver for prodding i
donkey, how much more to a ruffian for the greater cruelty oi i
brutal assault, to the infliction of injury and pain, upon man, woman
or child? His punishment will be a certainty, when it is i

SUNDAY CLOSING.
[Latest from St. Albans.)
The reoent correspondence on the subject of the Sunday Visiting
of St. Albans has led to the following arrangements being made by
the local Authorities, which, it is hoped, will meet all the require-
ments of the case.
Intending Visitors to the Abbey will not be admitted within its
preoincts before oook-crow on Sunday morning, unless specially pro-
vided with a card authorising their entrance from the Dean.
The same regulation will apply to those desirous of visiting the
sacred building either in the middle of the services or after
night-fall.
No permission, however, will be deemed requisite in the case of
those who have successfully dodged away from under the eye of the
Verger in charge at any other period of the day; but those who have
succeeded in doing so must understand that, in the event of his
leaving the edifice for the purpose of taking his luncheon or tea, they
will be locked in till his return.
In the event of this happening late in the afternoon, and it appear-
ing likely that those who are thus detained may have to make a
night of it within the Abbey walls, assistance may be sought by
shouting oat through the West window for " the Dean," who, if he
happens to be within hearing, may possibly inquire into the matter,
and give it his attention; but, any attempt on the part of those
detained to escape by climbing and letting themselves down by torn
cushion-covers, will be strongly deprecated by the Authorities.
Visitors unwittingly looked in in the enclosure while admiring
the exterior, will be at liberty to escape, if they oan, by getting over
the iron railings, and for this they will not require the written per-
mission of the Dean.

THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.
VII.—FROM THE Heart OP H-RT-NGT-N.
Devonihire House. Monday.

EAR TOBT,
I have just been think-
ing whether Ufa is more
endurable while Parlia-
ment is sitting, or in the
recess on the eve of a
General Election. 1
haven't decided yet, and
really feel too bored to
continue the debate. I
fancy, to Bpeak off-hand,
that I would rather have
the Session—that is, when
Gl-dst-nk'm all right and
I haven't to take charge
of the ship. Whilst we
are in Opposition I could
come and go when I liked,
and between you and me,
I like going best. But
now one never knows
where he is, gallivanting
about the country, making speeches in hot and crowded rooms to
exoited electors. Then the next morning there's those newspapers at
you; something you 've done that you ought to have left undone, or
something omitted that spoils the whole effect of an otherwise fairly
good speech.
Did you see how they went for me the other day because, speaking
on a Friday night, I did not reply to a speech made by the Markiss
on the night before? It's all very well for fellows like Ch-mb-bl-n
to do things of the kind. But I'm not going to be hurried.
Besides, before the Markiss spoke I had my speech all ready, and if
they thought I was going to chuck it away and make another at an
hour's notice they made a mistake.
I trust, dear Toby, you will take warning by my dreadful example,
and keep out of politics. Since the day, now twenty-six years gone,
when I moved a Vote of No Confidence in Lord D-bby's Government,
I have soarcely had a happy hour. There have been brief gleams of
joy when we have gone into Opposition. But they have been speedily
quenched by fresh responsibilities and duties. I don't know what I am
doing in the galley at all. I have been impressed, chained to the oar,
and there I slave. But how sore at heart it is only in moments of
confidence like this that I disclose. I would get out of it, but there
would be the bore of explanations, struggling with entreaties and all
that sort of thing. So I drift on, stolidly doing what work is
appointed for me, quitting the shop as early as possible, and staying
away as long as they '11 let me.
I suppose a orisis will arise some dav, and there will be presented
the spectacle of what I hope Gl-dst-ne will allude to as
"H-bt-ngt-n rightly struggling to be free." I have gone a long
way with Ch-jib-bl-n, but there seems no end of his journey, and
we must inevitably come to the parting of the ways. What shall I
do then P G-fcn-N and [ could work very well together, and F-bst-r
would be elad enough to get into any respectable company that would
look like fighting Ch-mb-rl-n. But F-rst-r's out of the hunt now.
lie played his cards so badly after leaving us as to destroy any
chance of reinstatement with the Liberal Party, either in the House
or the country. G-sch-n and T, standing shoulder to shoulder on a
back seat, would play havoo with the strongest Radical Government
that could bo form»d. Put what's the good? That means more
work, even harder and more engrossing work. Better stop where I
am than undertake a business of that kind.
I was rather struck with that notion of the Markiss's to cut the
whole business and go out and earn his own liviug. If they really
went, and the Markiss was to say " Come over and nelp us," I would
be much more inclined to accept the invitation than the one from
Il-ND-LPH. I have rather a hankering for the ranch business. I
think it would suit me, and besides, we could not have Grand Cr-ss
with us. There would plainly be no place for a beadle on a ranch.
I own the prospeot of spending a succession of long evenings with
Grand Cr-ss rather warns me off.
In truth, Tobt, all things are vanity. But most of all this going
to and fro and making of long speeches. It 'a the very d-v-1. I
sometimes sit under my tilted hat in the House of Commons, and
meditate with wonder upon Gl-dst-ne. How can he take such keen
interest in all kinds of divers matters as they present themselves to
him? He worries me with his restless activity, and tires me with
his tireless energy. I want to get away from it all and do as I like,
come and go when I like, say what I like, and be silent when I please.
I fancy (though it is a worry to fancy) that I will make a passably
good Duke. Very little is expeoted from a duke, and once emanci-
pated very little they '11 get from me.
This is a serious letter, but life is a serious thing, especially to
Yours faithfully,
H-rt-ngt-n.
To Tobt, M.P., The Kennel, Barks.
P. S.—Did you ever hear of an American politician they call" Sun-
set Cox?" He got this name because he orce said, in reference to
his position in the political world, " I am becoming rather a memory
than a hope." I suppose by-and-by these confoundedly frank
newspapers will be writing of me as Sunset H-rt-not-n 1
WHY AM I A LIBERAL?"
1. "Why am I a Liberal?" Beoause I am (Dr. Johnson) "not
mean; nor low in birth," or, if so, still my conduct and manners are
"becoming a gentleman." Because I am "munificent, generous,
bountiful "—always entirely at my own expense.
2. "Why am I a Liberal?" Because I am (later dictionary defi-
nition) "one who advooates greater freedom, especially in politics."
I am opposed to intimidation, dictation, and every kind of restric-
tion upon psrsonal liberty, whether autocratic or democratic
3 Why am I a Liberal?" Because I intend, politically and
socially, to do as I would be done by. Because I am not a pseudo-
Liberal. I do not envy those who are better off, or better educated
than myself. I do not hate them. I advocate reform and retrench-
ment from a sincere sense of justice, and not from a covert desire to
reduce the circumstances, and diminish the incomes of people in a
social position superior to my own. Beoause, although anxious for
peace and eoonomy, I uphold the maintenance of our national defences
on an amply Liberal scale. Because I really wish to ameliorate the
condition of the poorer classes, from a feeling of true benevolence,
and don't offer to support their demands, reasonable or unreasonable,
merely in order to catch their votes, and induce them to gratify my
propensities of self-esteem, and love of approbation, by returning me
to Parliament, and enabling me to obtain plaoe and power.
4. "Why am I a Liberal?" Because my Mother-in-law's a Con-
servative. So'smyWife.
5. "Why am I a Liberal?" Because I like the dinners at the
Reform Club; and if you ask me why I'm a Reformer, I answer
because I never yet saw anything good but what it could be better.
C. "Why am I a Liberal?" Because I choose. So shut up, and
get out I
GOING FOR GOSCHEN.
Sm Charles Duke objects to Mr. Goschen that "his critical
faculty is too strongly developed." Perhaps so. But then, 8ir
Charles, there are other Members of the Liberal Party whose critical
faculty does not seem to be developed at all. For indiscriminate
condemnation of one's opponents is not criticism, any more than
indiscriminate self-eulogy is. So Mr. Goschex's single supertlux
may be an advantageous set-off against their multitudinous defi-
ciency. You can hardly say of him that "he is nothing if not
critical." He is that and a good deal more. Yet you and Mr.
Cbambeblatn seem much disposed to try and Boyoott him. Very
foolish, very unfair, and, after all the loud talk of Liberal unity,
comprehensiveness, and tolerance, very inconsistent. Criticism has
been called the Gay Science. Leaden dulness naturally loves it not.
But what a dolorous deadlock of mindless monotony, of fatuous
uniformity, of goosr-flock gregarioueness, will Liberalism dribble
down to, if, leaving in all the gnthers and formula-grinders, you rub
out of its ranks every critioal eye and every coolly-discriminating
judgment 1 Nonsense, Sir Charles!

'ARRY ON SONG AND SENTIMENT.
Dear Charlie,
Your buthday, old bandbox, I 'ye got it marked down " orl kerreot,"
And some sort of a little momento is wot a old pal might expect.
Well, I know you 're a mark upon Sing-song, and nuts on the comical lay,
So I send you a roity collection of Popular Songs of the Day.
Reglar rousers, my pippin, I tell yer, the piok of the 'Alls took all round,
And the lot, sentimental or comic, '11 suit yer right down to the ground.
I fancy I 'ear your fine barrytone piping out " Mother'> Old Mug,"
Or " Doin' the Toff for a Tanner," or "'Arry, dear, put on the ' Ug!"
Some old bloke, I forget who exsaokly, although he gits quoted a lot,
And the D. T. jest trots him out reglar whenever it puts on the pot,
Remarks, "Let the Bigwigs make Laws for the People so I makes their Songs I"
And the hodds on that ohap being right are St. Paul's to a pair of old tongs.
He knowed English hearts, did that joker; he jest took my weight to a bounce.
Legislaters, my pippin, ain't in it along o' my pal, "The Big Bounoe."
He's top-row, if yer like, and no turnups, smart brougham, sealskin coat, all
0. K.;
Yet he tips me the haff able flipper as though I was fair on his lay.
Ah! to sit, mate, and listen to Aim, cigars round, and a bottle of fizz,
While he rattles out " Mashed on a Muggins," is wot I call real good biz.
Monday Pops are all kibosh and catgut, and even the Promenard palls;
If yer want Song and Sentiment, Chablie, fust chop, you must go to the 'Alls.
That's Life and no bow-wow, my biffin! The mugs who write poetry rot
All skim-milk and die-away doldrums, thev simply ain't up to wot 'a wot.
We want something spicy and sparklin'. Jest take wot a feller likes most,
Pop it into smart verse with a chorus, and there you are, served upon toast.
Wot would you and me do, my dear Charlie, if we 'ad a thousand a year?
That's larks, that's true poetry, ain't it? Not sawdust and snivel, no fear!
To cut a fair dash, dress slap-uppish, 'ave fourpenny smokes and good drink,
With a touch of the azure for fun, and for yum-yum a patch of the pink!
That's Life, mate, I say once agin, and put into a Song that's our mark,
And the bokos who try other barneys are bossing about in the dark.
The " Big Bounoe" hits the "bull" every time, mate, 'cos why? he 'as bin in
the swim,
And it's jolly few games on the board as don't open like hysters to 'im.
Don't he touch up our patriot feelings with " Britons shall bang 'em all round !" f
That's wot we can all understand, mate, and my! 'ow the 'obnails do sound!
Let the Tory lot give us a Leader as takes the " Big Bounoe " for his model.
And Brummagem Joe and his gang may jest piok up their trotters and toddle.
As to Sentiment, Charlie, ynu know as J ain't of the snivelling sort,
But " Mother's Last Spank" is a fetcher, while "Angels have called for Jim
Short,"
Or " Don't put Father's Watch up the Spout" are both very fair biz in their
way,
And a thousand times better than "Kathleen Mavourneen" or "Auld Robin
Gray."
"Spoons "—sweetheart or nursery, Charlie, go down with the'women, old ohap;
For wot they call " pathos," my pippin, is mostly a spechies of pap
Aprypo of the kids or the petticoats. Latter, of course, is my lay,
But I do like the rosy put rorty, and love-making done on the gay.
There, my pal, the " Big Bounce," is a hot 'un. What can be more lummy,
dear boy,
Than " Dasher the Masher," page ten? turn it up, it's a song to enjoy.
You should hear the B. B. roll it out, you should see his light kids and his wink!
If there is any party I envy, it's him, Charlie. Wot do you think?
Well, well, we can't all be Big Bounoes—wus luok! but 1 'm sure you '11 agree
That the Music 'AH Song paints a picter of wot we should all like to be;
And that's where it nails us, dear Charlie, and that's what I meant when I
said
That that Josser, whose name I've forgotten, 'ad 'it the right nail on the 'ed.
These Songs make the People, my pippin. We build ourselves up on their
plan,—
We snide 'uns, I mean, and the others ain't really wuth recknin', old man.
Wy, if we came into a fortune, in Dress or in Drink, Love or Larks,
Wot could we do better than take the B. B. as our primest of marks?
0, it makes a chap's mouth water, Charlie; I'm blowed if it don't. Just you
think
Of being a " Dasher the Masher," of 'aving his togs and his chink!
The gals at your feet, fun and frolic and fizz jest as much as you '11 carry!

FORGED CRITICISMS.
(A Letter, genuine, to our Mr. Nibbs.)
Dear Nibbs,
I don't very much care if you are hard or soft,
or even medium. At any rate, you are a "Magnum
Bonum," my boy. But when next you go to Ballaohu-
lish, and want to read about a new play in that outlandish

region, don't put more faith in Newspaper Advertisements
than in Dramatic Critics. You are inclined to judge the
latter by the former, and to condemn accordingly. Take
a leaf out of the book of Jat-Buchanan, and distrust
both. For, not to mince matters, the theatrical Adver-
tisements are "cooked" in the interest of theatres. I
will give you an example. The other evening, at the
Club, I read as follows in the Evening Standard :—
TtHE DAILY TELEGRAPH says :—" A plsy that is
-L rigorous, fpirittd, and nerer dull. It U full of dear ideas.
All are good. There is plenty of excitement, and material for a
dozen dramas. Mrs. Conover has an Olympic success."
"Great Scott!" said I to myself, "oan this be true P
Holy St. Clement, what does the fellow mean? He is
'Lost in London, not' Alone in London,' surely." So
I went to the original text, and what do you think I
found P An absolute mis-statement in every line. "It
is full of dear ideas " was originally printed in the D. T.
as follows: "It is full of clever ideas ; but. as a rule, they
are trusted." "All are good" refers to a few trivial inci-
dents that are quoted as good as compared to several
more pronounced to be bad I As to the Mrs. Conover
paragraph, it is pure bunkum. What the " Autocrat"
Raid was, Meanwhile, Mrs. Conover has a chance of an
Olympic success vet, if a few judicious alterations are
speedily made." Whioh is surely a very different thing 1
I wonder if Mr. Robert Buchanan is Mrs. Conover's
Advertisement Editor as well as her Olympian Author;
or can it be his literary partner, Miss H a k hi kit Jat, who
so ingeniously quotes a pithy sentence without its quali-
fying sting P Dramatic Critics may be all you say about
them—they may be far too prone to flourish "the pen of
a ready writer on first nights ; they may, as Buchanan
elegantly expressed it when he was rash enough to
attack one of them in 1883, "combine the individualities
of Mr. Puff and Mr. Sneer, sending round the hat with
one hand, and brandishing the bludgeon with the other,
alternating between the epilepsy of savage abuse and the
hysteria of sycophantic praise," &n., &o.; but they don't
all talk such nonsense as Mrs. Conoveb or Mr. Storm
Beaten Buchanan or Miss Waif Jat represent them
to talk, and their utterances are deliberately misrepre-
sented in the advertising columns. Now that Augustus
Druriolanus has done away with picture posters, for
goodness sake let us have truthful advertisements. Eh,
Nibbs, my boy, what do you say? Yours,
A Pit Bench.
Robert Buchanan, a word in your ear! Do you
remember abusing the Pit and the Critics for not liking
your "Sailor and his Lass" at Drury Lane? Do you
remember writing a letter so violent that your partner,
the Emperor Augustus, publioly apologised for it P Don't
do it again, my canny Scotchman. The Pit and the Critics
never forget!

Cardinal Manning has written a pamphlet, entitled,

dictates of their own Supreme Pontiff Conscience, and no
other, be he who he may. This must be a Cardinal point
in their political action.
"Every dog has his day,"—but not the mad ones, if
Dr. Pasteur can prevent it.
BABES ON THE WOOD.
Mr. Punch, Sib,
As the Model of Mankind, I appeal to you. Quite recently
that worthy Doctor of Divinity, Bishop Alford, wrote to the
Times, complaining that, as a traveller by the Underground Rail-
way, he had a grievance against the District Railway Company,
for permitting to be exhibited at the South Kensington Station, a
placard containing " a most objectionable figure." The indignant
ecclesiastic having piqued the curiosity, and no doubt excited the anger
of the civilised world, cruelly added that "he would not attempt to
describe it," further than to say that "it was descriptive of what is
to be witnessed at a certain place of entertainment." As I found,
after completing the reading of the Bishop's epistle, that this " shame-
less advertisement" was a constant inoentive to immorality," and
that his Lordship "never remembered seeing anything more gross
and suggestive paraded before the publio eye," I considered it my
duty to go to South Kensington Station myself, and inquire into the
matter, on behalf of "young persons" in general, and "British
Matrons " in particular.
Arriving at the platform reserved for those who desire to avail
themselves of the subway leading to the "Inventories," I looked
around me. The walls were oovered with " posters/' but I confess
on the first blush (I blushed out of compliment to the Bishop) I could
see nothing that was an " incentive to immorality." I make a note
of the pictures I saw before me, and have seen on other hoardings
belonging to the advertising contractors.
Lobster-Salad in the Desert.—An Oflioer under the influence of
electricity (his revolver is flying away from him, as if impelled by
some power known only to the most scientific) standing in out-up
frreen stuff, and regarding a figure from the collection of Madame
Tussaud's. In the distance, seotion of the most meaty part of a
lobster. This was very appropriately entitled "Poor Humanity,"
but I could see nothing objectionable from the point of view of a
moralist, although perhaps Professor Rusktn might have taken
exception to it artistically for its " want of truth."
The Economical Sofa.—A. Lady in the oostume of a Boulogne
bagneuse, of a more than usually modest charaoter, reclining with
apparent comfort on a bell-rope. For a moment I thought that per-
haps this figure might have proved the one singled out by a Bishop
| as " an inoentive to immorality," but really, on consideration, oame
to the conclusion that it was no "more coarse or suggestive than
(say) the Venus of Milo.
The Idiot Brothers.—Two foreigners, in an ectasy of terror, re-
garding a small cardboard box. This I understood, from the legend,
represented a scene out of the Great Pink Pearl. Nothing wrong,
bo far as I could see.
And with this entry my list was exhausted. True, there was a
fancy (a very fanoy) portraiture of the Albert Palace at Battersea,
but this was a landscape, and not an " objeotionable figure." Again—
on another hoarding—I have seen a comic man-cook (seemingly out of
an East-end Pantomime) whacking a gong, and a supercilious and
fashionably-attired mother wheeling a perambulator, but neither of
these were advertised to be witnessed "at a certain plaoe of
entertainment." Once more, there was certainly a placard advertis-
ing " Excelsior," in whioh a lady, dressed ohiefly in electrio light
and bangles, was literally jumping upon a gentleman who seemingly
had returned in a bad temper from a costume ball, where he had
appeared, with the assistance of a costumier, strong in daggers, as
Mephistophiles—but here there were two figures, ana not one.

playgoers will be content to wait.
I cannot see that Mr. Pinkro is muoh to blame, as I imagine he was
commissioned to write this pieoe in this particular, very particular,
way; and anyone, who may be interested in the matter, has but to
purchase the original play, for which he will go to Hacuktte, in

and herein their
playwright will probably agree with them. It is a matter of business,
and I think, personally, I should be of his opinion. But in this
per-version,—to borrow Mr. W. S. Gilbert's description of his own

with whioh the original French play was built up, although, even
there, the finish of the First Act was weak. As to the writing, the

part of the Wicked Nobleman shows many a touch of Mr. Pinebo's
sly humour, and in the hands of Mr. Cabtwbiqht, who represents
the gay Lothario of our Hereditary Legislating caste, not a point of

suffers from a strong
draught, and then goes just
so-fa and no farther, be-
cause he tumbles down

Khan-did-eight.
SORROWS OF A METROPOLITAN CANDIDATE.
With an amount of ignorance upon such matters of which I really
ought to be heartily ashamed, I naturally concluded that the terrible
fiasco of my first public meeting was fatal to any hopes I might have
previously entertained of devoting my-
self to the service of my country in
the Commons House of Parliament;
but, to my great astonishment, my
Agent came up to me smiling, and
saying that upon the whole we had
done very well, as the Hall was packed
with all the tag-rag; and hob-tail of the
neighbourhood, as lie curiously desig-
nated them, and that he had just heard
news which, if true—as he would ascer-
tain before seeing me again—would so
largely improve my chance of success
as to make it almost a certainty. Some-
what reassured by his cheerful tone and
manner, I sought my quiet home, and slept the Bleep of the hopeful.
One thing I had quite resolved upon. No more public meetings for
me—no, not if my election depended upon it. That grinning crowd,
with their shouts of laughter and derision at every little blunder
that I made, that awful-looking Clock with its almost immovable
hands, and the fierce questioning to which I was subjected, were all
so impressed upon my rather nervous temperament that I felt a
repetition of it would be too terrible to endure.
My Agent kindly gave me two or three days to recover myself,
and then brought me the very satisfactory information to which he
had previously alluded. It appears that before even the most pa-
triotic of mankind is allowed to aspire to assist in the government of
his country as an M.P., he must deposit with the Returning Officer
of the district he desires to represent the sum of two hundred pounds
towards the necessary expenses of the election. I had not myself
heard of this little matter previously, it having probably escaped the
recollection of my friend and Agent. It appeared then that, for-
tunately for me, my opponent, although a Patriot of the deepest
dye, and of most liberal principles as regards the more equal distri-
bution of other people's property, possessed, literally, none of his
own. When, therefore, the demand for two hundred pounds was
made upon him, he, to use his own impassioned language, threw
himself on his country, or, in other words, consented to the opening
of a publio subscription in the local paper, which, after being an-
nounced for a fortnight, had produced the totally inadequate sum of
£16 18». ■ihi!., together with nine postage-stamps from warm but
impecunious admirers.
The result of a long discussion between us was, that I should at
once seize upon every available opportunity of enabling my possible
constituents to contrast my supposed abundant wealth with my op-
ponent's palpable want of it. So, plaoing a cheque for a very con-
siderable amount in his hands, I left its expenditure to his sole
discretion. During the following week I had the gratification of
seeing my humble name announced as subscribing very handsomely
to all sorts and conditions of publio subscriptions, with the most un-
expected result that while every Treasurer in my District called on
me to solicit a handsome donation, I found myself denounced in the
opposition Local Press as trying to buy with money what I could not
obtain by merit, and the Independent Electors were asked if they
were going to bow down before the Golden Calf! and allow them-
selves to be sold like Cattle! I never was so shocked in all my life.
I was actually afraid to walk through the streets by day for fear of
being recognised and mobbed. I sent to my Agent to cease from
further operations of the same kind, but he replied that he had gone
so far that it would be useless to discontinue now, more especially as
he had heard my liberality spoken of very highly in several influential
quarters.
Sitting in what I call my Study, perplexed and bewildered, and
heartily regretting that I had allowed my ambition to overpower my
discretion, who should rush in but the companion of my youth and
the friend of my manhood, with whom I was formerly in the habit of
taking sweet counsel, who, dashing his hat down on the table, Bhouted
out at the top of his voice, "Well, if you haven't been and gone and
done it now, it's a pity I Astonished and alarmed at his unusual
energy, I begged him to explain himself, which he did by proving to
my entire satisfaction, if I can use such, a word to denote horrible
conviction—that my so-called liberality was in the eye of the Law,
"giving something valuable to influence the voting at an Election,
whioh under the 3rd Part of the 3rd Schedule of the 3rd Section of the
Corrupt and Illegal Practices Act, was punishable by a fine of £200,
or Impriionment for One Year! at, he supposed, the option of the

of Edinburgh ought not to
play only on the violin. He
should be a proficient on the
national instrument of the
land that gives him his title,
and come out powerfully on
the bag-pipes. As his Royal
Highness — who, if he be
always as nervous as he was
the other day, will have to
be known as His Royal Shy-
ness —only plays for Chari-
ties, there will be no neces-
sity to " pay the piper." But
whenever or wherever His
Royal Highness the Duke
pipes, he will never have to
complain that there were not
plenty of people to danoe
attendance. For ourselves,
rapturously fond as we are
of violins, bagpipes, and
Dukes, yet we should prefer
the air, "Within a Mile
of Edinbro'" and we would
alter "a mile" to "five miles," at whioh convenient distance we
would be content to remain during the Ducal performance, in order
to make room for those to whom proximity to the player may be
even a greater delight than it would be to us.

FREE AND INDEPENDENT ELECTORS.
There is, after all, a kind of grim humour among the Land-
Leaguers, though in the House of Commons they are a dull lot. In
the course of his peregrinations, planting out Candidates as if they
were cabbages, Mr. Pahnell arrived at Cork the other day, and
nominated two obscurities, who were accepted without controversy.
At the end of the proceedings it is reported that
"Mr. John Dillon congratulated those present on the extraordinary
success of the meeting. Its result was to refute the statement that the Irish
people were unable to govern themselves, and for his own part he considered
that such a gathering would have been impossible in England."
Mr. Punch heartily agrees with this view. He would go further,
and say that such a gathering with such a purpose, would be impos-
sible even in Russia, or among the Negro Electors of South America.
That a high-spirited and intelligent race, like the Irish, should sub-
mit to this absolute abrogation of electoral rights is a marvel. It is
also a wonder that Mr. Pahnell takes the trouble to go round the
country carrying his nominees with him, and personally produoing
them as if they were marionettes. He might just as well issue a list
setting forth the various constituencies, appointing members to each,
and so have done with it.
"IN FOR A DIG."
Mr. Herbert Gardner, writing to the Standard a reply to
Mr. Strutt, his opponent, about ''Farmyard Canvassing" said,
"The Labourers are Liberal, the Masters, for the most part,
Conservative." Now, probably, were the Masters truly Liberal there
would be more ehanoe of their Labourers being Conservative. A
Gard'ner may be trusted to know something about labourers, and he
evidently does. The name of Strutt is suggestive, too, of farm-
yards, though more of a Bantam making rather too cock-sure of
victory before it is won, than a farm-labourer. A Strutt would
be an authority on Sports and Pastimes, but not muoh as to present
times. A Gard'ner must evidently have a professional advantage, in
any war of words, as he can " call a spade a spade" straight out;
but, at the same time, we should advise the Gard'ner not to waste
too muoh time in having a dig at his opponent, but to get well ahead
—detur dig-niori—walk on sharp, and leave the rest to—Strutt.
Eh !—Lord R. Grosvenor says the Tory party have at last found
a fetish in Disestablishment. Their object, Lord Richard, is
perhaps less fetish than defeat-ish I

As all the world shall know;
And if they try it on with me,
I tell them—Not for Job!
I'm up behind the Liberal 'Bus, the driver's name is Bill,

If doubtful fares will try it on, I tell them—Not for Job I

Not for Joseph, 0 dear no 1
Hi! All the way! Step in 1 Step in! That is my usual cry,
But a curious-looking Customer I notice standing by,
I know him well, ana as a Fare. I've found him not to pay,
For he's always grumbling at the pace, and won't go "All the way."
Chorus—I'm wide awake, &c.
No friend of mine, this ticklish fare, a fidget, full of fright,
When in his seat, at the first "apart," he's anxious to alight.
He hails me now. "An inside place this time," says he. "you knot?."
Says I, "I'm truly grateful, but excuse me—Not for Joe!

SOMETHING LIKE A HECKLE.
Specimen of an Examination Paper intended for Parliamentary
Candidates.
1. Are you prepared, in addressing Public Meetings, to make use
of language towards your political opponents which you would never
dream of applying to your worst enemy
in private life?
2. If you have a general sort of id a
that Free Trade has brought unnum-
bered blessings to the oountry, yet that
there is a good deal to be said in
favour of Protection, how would you
express that opinion in a form whioh
would not subjeot you to the charge of
being a muddle-headed donkey?
3. "Verbosity covers a multitude of
inconsistencies." Explain this maxim,
and state how many contradictory
opinions you think can be true at one
and the same time.
4. Give specimens of the Billingsgate which just succeeds in escap
ing the incidence of the law against slander.
5. Do you oonsider hobnailed-boots or a pocket-revolver the
handiest weapon when your opponents are throwing the chairs about
at one of your own Party meetings?
6. Explain the following words and expressions:—" Chuckers-
out," "jerrymandering," "Carpet-baggers," "StrictJParty Disci-
pline," and " Arbitration declined with thanks."
7. At what period of Party history did it first become the custom
for Cabinet and ex-Cabinet Ministers to go round the country agita-
ting against the ideas of their " distinguished Leader."
8. Magna tit impudentia et prevalebit." Examine this phrase,
and give a list of third-rate politicians who have raised themselves to
the rank of " Statesmen" by language and conduct of which any
gentleman would be heartily ashamed.

'Do you
itreelly?"
CUM GRA.NO.
It has been rumoured in not too well-informed Circles—
That a very August Personage, indeed, has telegraphed to Prince
Alvx an dee " not to mind being snubbed, but to keep his spirits up."
That, in the event of the Czah insisting on the return of Prince
Alexander's uniform, a Commission in a Highland Regiment of
Volunteers will be forthwith offered him through the Authorities
at the War Office.
That, Lord Salisbury has had a communication from Balmoral
that has obliged him to telegraph information to Constantinople which
has turned the hair of the British Representative white in half-an-
hour.
And lastly, that, events will show that the most important interests
of the Empire have been made subservient to a high and exalted
Family Connection, with results that will be as startling to, as they
will have been unexpected by, the British Public.
Those Forty Years.
[Some of the papers complain that Mr. Bbioht's long-looked-for Speech
at Birmingham, was disappointing, retrospective, and even semi-Toryish in
tone.]
"'Tis forty years ago, friend John." Ah, yes I
Yet zealots grumble that your gaze seems less
Upon the future, than on that brave past
Of strenuous struggle, and of fighting fast.
Turned Toryish, my valiant veteran r Bah, no I
But, such a forty played, one plays piano.
Time will steal on, and though much good it leaves,
Age finds those forty years just Forty Thieves 1
Make your Games!
The idea of Poor Children's Play-Rooms it seems has been practi-
cally experimented upon in the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields,
with what " A Curate," writing to the St. James's Gazette, plain-
tively calls "almost formidable success." If, with fire pound s'-
worth of toys, and a big room, hosts of children can be supplied with
hours of healthy and happy recreation as often as they are permitted
to assemble, there seems no reason why the little Jaoks and Jills of
the slums should be dull boys or girls ever any more, or why poverty,
dirt, and over-pressure should have it all their own way. Bravo,
good Gentlemen of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields! Mr. Punch will
watch your further proceedings with much interest and sympathy.
"MILK BELOW 1"
In a recent number of the Lancet, we read:—" There is room for
the exercise of philanthropy in procuring and distributing Milk to
the poor of our large cities." According to that Journal an abund-
anoe of Milk could be supplied at two-pence per quart, and yet leave
a fair profit for the producer, were the excessive cost of distribution
lessened, as it could De, by a proper organisation. Sir James Cairo
says that for £100 received for Milk in London, the producer receives
but £40, whilst the distributors receive £60. This looks like the
handiwork of our old friend the Middleman again! The Lancet goes
on to say:—
"The collection and distribution of Milk to the poor of our cities, towns,
and villages, at the least possible cost, would open up a sphere for energy,
and at the same time afford some promise of relief to the depressed condition
of Agriculture, whilst it would be a boon to many an ill-nourished and im-
poverished constitution, now deprived of this valuable article of diet."
Now then, practical philanthropists, here's your chance I The milk
of human kindness is plentiful; how can it work better than to make
the other kind of Milk equally abundant?
CHEAP. DRIPPERS.
Mr. Roberts, of Bertram and Roberts, proposes the utilisation
of Dripping for the benefit of the starving poor, instead of selling it
as a Cook's perquisite. Hear! Hear I Why hasn't anyone turned
their attention to the subject before? The good Sisters of Nazareth
House, Hammersmith, and members of other similar charitable
institutions, must have used it for years, and well brought up
children have considered it as rather a luxury, yet it has been
generally neglected, just as the Waters of Barnet, the Wells of
Sadler, and the Mineral Springs of Stanmore in the Harrow distriot
have been allowed to flow unnoticed. Why does not Mr. Roberts
turn his attention to the numerous " Dripping Wells" of England?
Why, there's a natural supply ready at hand. Dripping, according
to the old-established proverb, possesses also wonderful solvent pro-
perties. There is evidently a great future before Dripping.
"Guerdon,— Recompense, Seward."
[The Rev. Mr. Gcbdon, in the Tablet, says that " What we are suffering
from in these evil days is general unwhippedness."]

The only thing to perfect poor Humanity
Is Charity's solatium—a " Whip Round" I
In future, associating the Reverend Gentleman's name with the
punishment, a whipped boy may speak of his flogging as " the Guer-
don of my guile;" and, if he wants another quotation, he can allude
to it as ''the just Guerdon of all his villanies.
"Robert v. Roberts."—Oar esteemed friend and contributor is
j ustly angry with the Aquarium Caterer, and with the Pall Mall Inter-
viewer who headed a paragraph " Robert drinks the Half-bottles,"
last Saturday. "I'm waitin," says Robert, "and pleese the pigs

What's the "Use of Sarum ? "—Something, if this item of

turning over a new leaf, and adding another page to the Sarum

THE ELECTION OF THE LOAD MAYOR AT THE GUILDHALL.
Oh, what a glorious Civio crush! How faces glow, how optics gluten!
Why, even Gog and Magog hare descended to look on and listen.
The Aldermen in ranks crowd close, the Liverymen all hotly hurtle
To see this mighty Function in the sanctum saored to the Turtle.
How disentangle this thick throng and how identify and localise.
From Mayor who dons the golden chain, to Liverymen who wildly
vocalise,
Its individual units? Lord Mayor Staples stands (the happy
wearer
Of this year's chain of office, o'er his shoulders oast by the Maoe-
Bearer)
The glittering centre of the show. Around him Aldermanio notables
And smart Town Councillors are ranged, all potent souls among the
potables.
Take the top rank from left to right, an Aldermanio lot completely,
First Hanson, Waterlow behind, then H. A. Isaacs. Smiling sweetly,
As at some meeting at the " Horns" at Kenning ton when "heckled"
wildly
By Lambeth lamb 3, McArtht/r stands. 'lis thus Sir William
beameth mildly
At civio feast, at Mission " spout," or on an angry Deputation;
An Sin's own smile is not more fixed, childlike, and bland. Stand
next in station
De Keyser, Ellis, Cotton, Dakin; then that Tory, stout True-
Towler,
Poetic, classic-quoting Chief known to all men as Lord Mayor
_ Fowler,
Last in the Chair, and twice eleot, great champion of Civio glories,
Whose boldness and whose bits of Greek so oft enchant the cheering
Tories.
Sir Henry Knight, Trdscott (Sir F.), and then, hirsute and still
undaunted.
Sir Robert Car den rears his plume that's always to the front when
wanted.
Sir Andrew Lusk comes next, and then Cowan and Owden. Stone
then finishes
The great top line; but with the next civic importance soarce
diminishes.
Wildash is placed near Magog's hand, and next in curly splendour
standeth
Brisk Sir Jobn Bennett, whose brave show the Mob's half-chaffy
cheer oommandeth.
Then Common-Serjeant Charley comes, the GLADSTONE-smasher.
Just above him
T. Roderick, City Secondary, looking as though vain Shows won't
move him.
Ex-Sheriff Whitehead next appears, then, to the right of the Mace-
Bearer,
Sir Thomas Chambers, gentle Knight, of Civic honours worthy
wearer.
Behind him stands the Crier, then H. Hombwood Crawford, City
Solicitor,
Grey, Altman, Pitman (spectacled). Then to the left once more a
visitor,
The City Marshal we espy, stout, epaulettel, and just over him
Malthousk and Goodinob. If you seek for Sheriff Evans you'll
discover him
Below the Lord Mayor's dexter elbow. Cross again; just where
the Mace is,
Eighty-Five's Sheriff to the world presents the loftiest of faces.

TRUTH IN EARNEST.
A Pabaobaph, or, to write it in abbreviated form, a "Par,"' in
Truth last week says :—
"Tvlbr and his gang intend, I hear, to send out Lord Donouohmorb
on a private mission."
Historically we would ask, " What Ttxeb" P The answer is " Sir
Henkt," and the object of the "private mission" in question appears
to be care for the interests of the Peruvian Bondholders in the Chilian
Debt. We should like to see Lord Donoughmoee in the oostume of
a " Private Missionary." But, if there be anything in a name, this
Lord can "Do no more" than he oan do, like Hon Ferdinando,
because probably he " Dun know more " than anybody else, and not
so much as evidently does the author of this inspired "Par."
Truth's motto, which is a warning also to all bogus financiers and
speculators, is " Keep your eye on your' Par ' in our paper, and your
'Par ' will pull you through."
New Title.—Mr. Punch stands Godfather to the Cookery and
Food Exhibition to be opened in December, and names it "The
Cookeries."
"OLD TIMES COME AGAIN NO MORE!"
"F. R. S.," writing to the Timet, last Thursday, d propos of prizes
for Natural Science, said, "Since Fellows of Colleges have been
allowed to marry, the mercenary spirit in the administration of such
matters has distinctly increased. Of course Fellows' wives are
probably strict economists; even dining in Hall would be considered
by them as something to be indulged in only on state occasions and
at stated times; and probably the after-dinner sittings in Common
Room would be tabooed entirely. The old ballad of " The Monks of
Old" needs very little adapting to the present case. Here it is:—
Oh, many have told
Of the Fellows of old,
What a jovial lot they were;
And 'lis mott true
That a merrier crew
Could not be found elsewhere.
For they laughed and chaffed,
And the good wine quafftd.
And told some stories queer.
They laughed Ha! ha!
And quaffed Ha! ha!
And lived on the daintiest cheer.
But a time came when
These jovial men
To marry were allowed.
With Cupid's wings
They flew for rings,
And to Hymen's yoke they bowed.
Then they laughed and chaffed,
And the good wine quaffed,
Only twice or thrice in the year.
Thev laughed Ha! ha!
They quaffed Ha! ha!
'Twas the dismalest thing to hear.
Then " F. R. S." says, "An Oxford College which for years gave
annually a Scholarship and sometimes an Exhibition as well in
Natural Science" well, not to quote at length, the Exhibition is
not given now. How oan it be expected P Doesn't a Fellow's wife
want to com e up to London to see the Exhibition in South Kensington P
Isn't that Natural Science? And if the Fellow, excellent good
Fellow that he is, should still shut his eyes to the fact, then the
sooner he opens them the better for his peace of mind and for his
pocket, as he will find his wife a practical Professor of Domestic
Economy and the most erudite teacher of Natural Science. But alas
for the Colleges! and alas for the Universities 1 Their ruin is
imminent—brought about by the Ladies (bless 'em!) and our South
Kensington series of Eleotrio-lighted Exhibitions.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHA.RIVARI.
THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.
Till.—Feoh "A Political Rodent."

eab Toby,
I daresay yon will have
seen in the publio prints
descriptions of the treatment
I have met with at the hands
of my fellow countrymen in
various parts of the Kingdom.
At the present crisis, with a
General Election pending,
and the possibility of a new
Government coming in or the
old one being strengthened
(in either case involving the
disposition of places and
Srofits), 1 hold it to be the
uty of every patriot Eng-
lishman to appear on the
soene. 1, it is well-known,
am above all things a pat-
riot Englishman, and I nave
acoordingly appeared on the
platform—upon several plat-
forms in faot. The result
has been identical in every instance. Whether I have spoken in the West of
England, or in mv own county of Kent, I have been received with a oontumely
that has drawn the line only at dead cats. I am not a man easily put down.
I have a due sense of my own value, and of the value of the views 1 desire to
communicate to the publio. When I have prepared expositions of these, and get
on a platform with intent to deliver them, I mean to do so. But only the other
day, a well-dressed mob and I wrestled for three-quarters of an hour, I attempt-
ing to speak, and they determined not to hear, keeping up an aooursed chorus of
"Yah, Turncoat!"
Now, Toby, why is this, and why should this be? I have been before the
publio for many years, and have earnestly and disinterestedly sought to serve
them. I was a Lord of the Treasury for seven years, receiving a mere trifle of
£1000 a year. At a slightly advanced remuneration I became Under-Secretary
of State for the Home Department, and then went to the Colonies, where
H-bt-ngt-w, who has always snubbed me, once said he " wished I'd stopped."
When Gl-dst-ne formed his Government in 1880, I was there, quite ready
to serve my country again, and did not scruple to let Gl-dst-ne Know this.
But humbly as I think of myself, I was not inclined to go on at the Under-
Secretary rate of pay, and suggested that it was about time I received a pro-
motion which I knew would be gratifying to mv oountrymen, and contributory
to the Imperial interests. G. did not see things in that light. There was a new
class of men coming on, who claimed the top plsces at the table, and G. weakly
yielded to them. As for me. he could hardly find words to express his regret
that he could not make me Home Ssoretary or Secretary for the Colonies. But
he hoped I would accept a Peerage. At first I declined, not seeing at the
moment how I could serve my country in that position. But he was so persistent,
and is so persuasive, that at length I yielded, really rather to oblige him than
to gratify myself. Yet people say that I importuned him, and represent him as
tossing me a Patent of Peerage partly to get rid of me, and partly to hasten the
decomposition of the House of Lords by lowering its standard.
There is, of course, the little difficulty about my turning round immediately
afterwards and making advanoes towards the Conservative Party, advanoes
which I am bound to say have not been received with that alaority I had
expected, and, as I may say, had a right to expect. I own that I was a little
precipitate. If I had to do it over again I would act differently. Perhaps it
would have been as well to allow a year, or say two years, to elapse before I
became what mv friend Lord R-nd-lph, very properly applying the phrase to
Lord D-rby, calls a " political Rodent." To the gross mind, not acoustomed to
fairy lore, I admit that having in the early spring been anxious to take office
with G., and failing that having got a Peerage out of
him, the autumn was a little early to turn and bite the
hand that favoured me.
But it was all for the sake of my country. I could not
see my late colleagues hurrying the country to the dogs
without uplifting a voice, which though a little harsh is
humble. Besides it is not quite the thing in the House
of Lords to be Liberal in politics. It's all very well for a
young fellow like R-s-b-by, long established and wealthy,
or for a man like Gb-nv-lle, of far-reaching family asso-
ciations. But your parvenu, whether peer or oommoner,
nearly always hoists the Tory colours. It may be the
Stupid Party; but it is also the Respectable Party.
Moreover, it was clear there was nothing more to be
got out of the Liberals, while the Conservatives are not
so well off for talent that they could ignore the genius
that wrote Crackert for Christmas, Tales at Tea-Time,
and Snoring for Supper. Then there is my country—
but I forgot, I mentioned that before.
Now, Toby, when you have reviewed this state of
things, and considered this plain unvarnished tale, I am
sure you will agree with me that my reception at
publio meetings is inexplicable. The whole thing is
strange to me. I don't seem to have hit the public
taste, and if you could kindly point out where I have
gone wrong, except in that little matter of precipitancy
I have noted, I shall be muoh obliged. Uriah Heep
liked to be despised. I don't find it altogether oomfort-
able. Besides, it interferes with one's profit and promo-
tion. Write soon to Yours despondently,
To Toby, M.P., The Kennel, Barks. Br-
IN "NORTHERN LATITUDES."
It is not given to all mortals to evince so Christian a
disposition as did Mr. Pecksniff, on the memorable occa-
sion of his saying to his daughter, "Chabity, my dear,
when I take my chamber-oandlestick to-night, remind
me to be more than usually particular in praying for
Mr. Anthony Chuzzlewit, who has done me an injus-
tice." Nor does the temperament of Mark Tapley—ti
highly improbable person, by the way, whose like we
shall never look upon again, the patent for suoh a crea-
tion having died with Charles Dickens—fall to the lot
of very many persons, especially in Northern Latitudes, and
so it is not surprising that Mr. Edmund Yates, Proprietor
and Editor of the World,—" Edmundus, Ed. Mundi,"
—having decided to give us some accounts of his deten-
tion for seven weeks in Holloway Gaol, should have
honestly endeavoured to avoid the appearance of being
Peoksniffian in his forgiveness on the one hand, and of
being absurdly Tapleyian on the other. The via media
is the course he has chosen, and, as usual, it is the safest
for himself and the pleasanteBt for his readers.
That the narrative of his sojourn in "Northern Lati-
tudes " should occasionally suggest the idea of "reserved
force'' and strained gaiety is only natural, but being
intended as an additional chapter to his cheery Recol-
lections, and to be bound up with the new and popular
edition, it was essential that its tone should be in keep-
ing with that of those two very readable and gossipy
volumes. That he should tell us the story of the trial
as an unprejudiced " bystander," and of his experience of
the interior of the prison quite as an outsider, was neither
to be expected nor wished.
Lookers-on may see most of the game, but it does not
follow by any means that they know most about the
moves, nor that they can give more than a very super-
ficial account of what they have seen. They may see
most, but they don't see it all. We should regret if
Mr. 5 ates had quite succeeded in the character of a
"Bystander" or Outsider, but he may most certainly
congratulate himself on having so gilded and flavoured
this particular Holloway pill as to make it thoroughly
acceptable to the public.
"Pabadise Regained."—It is stated that the Rev.
Mr. Eden, Vicar of Ticehurst, in Sussex, lately seized
some thirty thousand hop-poles for the non-payment of
that rural opprobrium known, and hated, as "extraor-
dinary tithe; Ticehurst must now understand more
clearly the depth and subtlety of the poet's meaning
when he spoke of "the happy Eden Btate.' Lord Salis-
bury, and other enthusiasts oasting about for crushing
arguments against Disestablishment, please take notice!

A GOOD PIECE OF BUSINESS.
Seeing that this piece, at Toole's Theatre, is ohiefly about invest-
ments, prices, buying and selling shares, aud City business generally,
On 'Change ought to be described as " a stock pieoe.''
On 'Change, in spite of its name, remains, as the Scotch Professor
■would say, materially " on-changed" from what it was when I read
it years ago in MS., and considered its success very uncertain on the
English stage unless re-modelled, and considerably re-written. The
scenes hang together loosely. The first two Aots would be vastly im-
proved by compression; alsoby toningdownthe " business," thequarrel-
ling, and the strained laughter, which soon beoomes wearisome. The
reminded me of Robertson's earliest work, and the love-making
in the last Aot is first oousin, or cousin-german, to the milk-jug
scene in School. But, by the way, wasn't School also derived from
a German source?
Having said this I have nothing but praise for the details of busi-
ness, the laugh-
sro/ able situations,
and the excellent
sketch of the
Sootoh Professor
given by Mr.
Felix Morris.
A Scotchman
with his broad
dialect is always
more or less a
nuisanoe on the
stage: the truer
to nature the
imitation, the
worse for the
success of the
piece. But in
On 'Change, Mr.
Morris is the
exception, and a
remarkable one,
to the rule. There
is not too much of him, and in what there is, though on the very
border-land—as would be expected from a canny Scot—of oaricature,
yet Mr. Morris never crosses it, his only tendency being to ex-
aggerate the restlessness in his anxiety to emphasize the old
Professor's intensely nervous irritability. He is a wiry Scotch
terrier, very Scotch, and very wiry. Mr. Gerald Moore's idiotic
but very third - rate Masher, though first-rate thorough-going
little cad, is a very funny bit of ecoentricity, but most danger-
ously near the humour of the
corner-man in nigsrer minstrelsy.
There is a Mr. Frank Evans
playing Tiffin, a servant in the
piece, who, if Mr. J. S. Clarki
ever revived The Corned}/ of
Errort, might play Dromio of
Ephesus to his Dromio of Syra-
ctue. Sometimes his tone, action,
and facial expression were J. S.
Clarke to the life.
Than Mr. Farren as James
Burnett, the kindly, genial,
straightforward man of business,
no one could be better. In itself
it is not much of a part by the
side of such a strongly-markt d
eccentrio character as the Pro-
fessor, and the over-coloured De
Haas, but Mr. Farren gives it
an importance and a tight-
ness which make it, in its
way, quite a little triumph of
art,—considering the very poor material at his command.
The Ladies—bless 'em!—are all nice; the part of Iris, played by
Miss Eweretta Lawrence, being apparently intended for something
between Minnie Palmer's Sweetheart and a knowing Lydia Lan-
guish. I do not quite understand Miss Iris, but perhaps she is a
style of young lady, whether American or German 1 cannot say, new
to me, and so it may be that I am not competent to pronounce judg-
ment on this variety of the softer sex.
Toole's Theatre, during the absence of its spirited Proprietor, who
is on " guan-publio business," like Sir Henry James, in the North,
i« under the direction of Mr. W. Duck and Miss Eweretta
Lawrence. A Pair of Ducks! This Duok of a Manager takes the
Company to the 8trand Theatre,—a Duck having a natural attraction

month, and then they will fly to another home. "Follow our Dux"

is the Company's motto. The Ducks may plume themselves on
having got a success, and their bills will be much the same for a
year, if they will rearrange the piece, rewrite it here and there,
settle down in some
convenient spot, and
not be scurrying oil
like Wild Ducks. But
Duck is not a goose:
he knows what he's
about, for is he not
the sole proprietor of
Our Boys t and hasn't
he scored off it to any
amount? At all events,
without mentioning the
precise sum, his score
is not represented by
"a Duck's egg;" very
much the reverse.
There's no reason why
On 'Change, with a
little touohing up,
should not run a year
or more. The Scotch
Professor is already
a popular charaoter in
London. There is one
great ohance he misses:
perhaps he knows what it is, and in his hands, if he avails
himself of it, Professor Seneca Peckering Peck would become
a second Dundreary. But this secret remains looked, from the
public, in the bosom of Yours truly, Unsplit Nibbs.

Iris and her Beau; or, The Love Match.
THE WORKING MAN'S FRIEND.
[At a largo open-air Meeting of Workmen in Wandsworth Road lately, a
Resolution was carried to the effect "That this Meeting of Workmen
repudiates with indignation the impudent profession of Mr. Gent-Davis to
be, as he styles himself, the Working Man's Friend."]
Bill Brown's view of it:—
Ah! it's all mighty fine and quite pooty to hear,
And the Muffs clap their hands and the Jugginses'cheer;
But to chaps as have heard it so often before,
This " Friend " business is getting a bit of a bore.
When Election time comes, and they 're after our Votes,
All the Candidates pipe to such popular notes;
They make much of our wives, and they love us no end,
For eaoh Swell on the stump is a Working Man's Friend.
When some dapper young Toff, with a twirly moustaohe,
Of mixed figgi-rs and fibs makes a horrible hash;
When, oarefully crammed like a poor Strasbourg goose,
Cooked statistics and cant on our heads he lets loose;
When he twaddles of Tariffs that Labour shall aid,
And remove the " appalling Depression of Trade ";
You may bet your last brown, ere he comes to an end.
He will spread himself out as the Working Man's Friend.
When a ohap to whose party the Labourer's Vote
Was as hard to get down as a bone in your throat,
ComeB to beg mine of me, who some few years ago
He libelled and sniffed at along o' Bob Lowe ;—
When he calls at my diggings, or sends round a lot
Of fine ladies to flatter, and fuss, and talk rot;
Then the man as would use us to serve his own end,
Tells the Missis and me he's the Working Man's Fritnd 1
Ah 1 but me and the new County Voter just now—
The chap with the hammer, the lad at the plough—
Have a rare lot of " Friends;" and it's capital sport
To watch 'em all playing at Codlin and Short.
But gents like Gent-Davis will patter in vain;
We hold them as help'd us before will again.
He who tells us straight truth, and plays square to the end,
Will have the best chance as the Working Man's Friend!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [November 21, 1885.
"STOCK A BUT-BABY!"
A few days since a naughty child called Sidney
Cron-mihe, trading as "Hebbebt Harbison and Com-
pany, Stock and Share Brokers," was sned for damages
for the non-delivery of certain Stocks for which a Mr.
Montgomery had paid him. The defence of the default-
ing Baby was that he was "an infant," and therefore
irresponsible—a plea which the Recorder and a Jury
were forced to admit was good in law. So the dear
ohild got a verdiot, but without oosts, and the unhappy
Plaintiff, a butcher at Peebles, Scotland, must put up
with the absence of the profit he might have secured
by purchasing Shares that suddenly rose from Is. 3d. to
£6,—and the loss he will no doubt sustain in squaring up
with his Solicitors. It is to be feared, consequently, that
poor Mr. Montgomeby will have to complain, before it is
all over, of the "banging" of considerably more than
"saxpence." But how comes it that Master Sidney
Croxmire, or "Messrs. Hebbebt Habbison and Com-
pany," or whatever his name may be, is permitted to
pote as a Stockbroker? Surely, the "House" should
not allow the admission of infants in arms. Is there in
the "House" a nursery for enfants terrible* t Doctors
and other professional men have to be of full age. One
never hears of a country Praotitioner going his rounds
to see his patients trundling a hoop, or receives from a
toddling Solicitor a bill of cos's bearing traces of a half-
consumed sugar-stick. In like manner, mere lads are
exoluded from the Church; and the spectacle of a baby
Parson trying ineffectually to peep over the top of a
pulpit is a pioture of the imagination only. That a
ohild of tender years should be permitted to become a
Sworn Broker, is a disgrace to the City of London, inas-
much as strong language is obviously most unsuitable to
the lips of sucklings. However, the case under review,
if it proves nothing else, establishes the faot to every-
body's satisfaction (Mr. Montgomeby's perhaps excepted)
that the announcement in the omnibuses that " infants
must be paid for," is legally defensible.

A BRITISH DRAMATIC MUSEUM.
One good .idea leads" to another, and the "Soudan Museum"
essay of Mr. Augustus Habbis should not be without its fruit.
Indeed it is already in contemplation to cap the Drury Lane display
by another, and even more appropriate one, in the shape of a collec-
tion of historic memorials connected with the annals of the Theatre
itself. That there is a rich fund here to draw upon there is no
doubt, and the idea hag only to be developed, and efficiently carried
out, to render the show one of the most interesting and entertaining
of its kind. A commencement, promising well for what is to follow,
has already been made, as the subjoined little preliminary nuoleus of
objects for the proposed Museum will serve to show.
"Early Poster," indicating the re-appearance of the Kembles,
headed with the announcement of " The Kembles are coming."
"A Curious Case of Flies " used under the Management of David
Gabbice. Also a pair of Mr. Bevebley's Wings.
"Several Strong Expressions" dropped by Mr. Macbeady while
playing Macbeth insufficiently rehearsed.
"The Identical Gin-Bottle 'supplied at the wing to the Elder Kean
prior to his fight with Richmond in Richard the Third.
"Orange " supposed to have been in the original basket oarried by
Nell Gwinne.
"Portion of the Pound of Butter " used in making the butter-slide,
together with the original Red-Hot Poker introduced into the after-
part of the Pantomime by Grimaldi.
"Fragment of the Original Marble Halls," in which the Bohemian
Girl.dreamt she dwelt, contributed from the effects of the late Mr.
Alfred Bunn.
"The'Speoial Alphabet " in use in the Theatre, with which indi-
vidual Managers have contrived, in turns, to mats " Shakspears,"
spell " Bankruptcy."
Preservation op Eppino Fokest.—A" Correspondent
writes to say:—" If something is not done to prevent
the wilful destruction of thorn bramble and trees, and
to put an end to the reckless sport of Cockney shootists,
the sooner a Bill to deal with the matter is brought in,
the better." Yes—if the Bill will keep out the Axe. But
this is a matter for the Corporation of London, which
holds the property in trust for the people.
"Full-length Equestrian Portrait of Mr. E. T. Smith."
"Bare Shilling Edition" of Walteb Scott's Tales, presented to
Mr. Halliday by Mr. Chattebton.
"Bold and Handsome Set of Cartoons," comprising pictorial
Posters utilised by Mr. Augustus Habbis prior to the production of
Human Nature.
"The First Big-head with highly Intellectual Countenance."
"Portrait of a Renter," name unknown.
"Real Sausage," left by the German Company.
"A Free List Entirely suspended," during the ran of a popular
Melodrama.
There are other "lots" of various descriptions, including ".Fossil
Boxkeepers," "Orders not admitted after Seven," and the identical
letter addressed by the Duke of Cam midge to Mr. Augustus TTahbth
on the production of Youth. The whole'affair promises well.
The present Soudan Collection Mr. Habbis must announce as
"The Soudaneries."
Anotheb Not-at-all-at-Home Secbetaby.—When Sir W. V.
Harcourt read how Mr. Yabley and Mb deputation fared at the
Home Office, and how there were hisses and groans, and cries of
"Shame 1" raised outside by the excited orowd, how the LateSeldom-
at-Home Secretary must have chuckled. The temper of a Not-at-all-
at-Home Secretary, who is always Cross, evidently rules in this
Governmental department.
Palpable Omission.—Mr. Goschen, lecturing "On Figures,"
never said one word as to the probable return of Crinolines or the
advantages of Dress-Improvers. The absenoe of any illustration
from a "Lay-figure" was alsomuoh commented upon, and generally
attributed by the Scotch Athenians to Mr. Goschen s desire not to
say anything on the Disestablishment question.

WANTED, A REVISED VERSION.
Who translated Pope Leo the .Thirteenth's Encyclical for
The Tablet f Here's a specimen:—
"The defence of the Catholic name, indeed of necessity, demands that in
the profession of doctrines which are handed down by the Church, the opinion
of all shall be one, and the most perfect constancy, and from this point of view
take care that no one connives in any degree at false opinions, or resists with
greater gentleness than truth will allow. Concerning those things which are
matters of opinion, it will be lawful, with moderation and with a desire of inves-
tigating the truth, without injurious suspicions and mutual recriminations."
Surely, the translator smut have modelled .his style on English as
she is Spoke, unless it be the work of the talented Author of that
popular book. Perhaps it is by way of concession to our prejudice in
favour of the vernacular, that it is put into a language supposed to be
"understanded of the people." If so, the effort, however commend-
able, is hardly successful. Papa Leo is too olassic and elegant a writer
to.be treated in this fashion, even by the most scrupulous adapter.
THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE, AND THE SHERIFF'S OFFICER.
Last week the Sheriffs for the coming year were nominated, and
the report of the proceedings published in the Times, of November
13th, is a most instructive article. Petitions to be excused from
serving were presented by the score. One gentleman explained that
he had had the greatest difficulty in meeting his present expenses, and
that entertaining the Judges would probably land him in the Bank-
ruptcy Court; another urged that he had had to let his Manor-house
and live in furnished apartments, a third, that he had lost all his
money in a Chancery suit; a fourth, that he had a small income and
a large family; a filth, that he had an estate in the county which
did not pay, and that he hoped soon to sell it, and so on, and go on.
On all sides oame stories of real genuine aristocrat iu distress, even
i painful in their miserable details. In fact, the general impression
i seemed to be, that only the inability to pay for the rope prevented
some of the proposed Sheriffs from undertaking their office, solely
I with an economical view of becoming their own exeoutioners.

[November 21, 188P.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S POLITICAL ADDRESS.
TO THE ELECTORS (AND NON-ELECTORS, MALE AND FEMALE) OF THE
UNITED KINGDOM, AND TO THE WORLD AT LARGE.

Ladies ane Gentlemen,
Rooey-tooey! You will all understand that to begin with. Whioh is
something in an Address, I assure you. 'Tis an old cry, and a hearty one,
suggestive of sincere greeting and honest intent. Whereas the exordium of
many a Parliamentary Candidate is much like the melancholy Jaques's "Duc-
dame," namely, " an invocation to call fools into a circle."
Mr. Punch is the only real Independent Candidate. He is the nominee of no
party, or sect ion, or sect. Wire-pullers come not between him and his huge con-
stituency. He is not to be Caucussed into conformity with any "Platform"
whatsoever, save his own, of whioh he provides all the "planks himself. As
the accepted Counsellor and Champion of all, he cannot to Party give up what
was meant—and is used—for Mankind.
As to loyally following his Leader, a man cannot correctly be said to follow
himself. And Mr. Punch has no other Leader. He invites the Leaders of all
parties to follow him. Then they will be all right.
As to Manifestoes, Programmes, and Points, Official or Extra-Offioial, Four,
or Six, or Sixty, Blue or Buff, or flaming Red, Grand Old, or Mild Middle-aged,
or Friskily Adolescent, Mr. Punch binds himself to none of them. His Mani-
festo is his weekly Journal, and that is always before the Public His Programme
is continuously unfolded in its pages, and they are in everybody's hands. He
makes his own Points and they are innumerable. He is not a Political Savage,
and does not therefore daub his whole person Blue, Buff, Red or Polychrome.
He combines in himself the ripe wisdom of age with the bright vigour of youth.
He therefore needs no tips from Harwarden or Hatfield, from Birmingham or
from Woodstock.
With "Cries" Mr. Punch has nothing to do. His business is to make men
laugh—wisely, but well. Rooey-Tooey.'
Mr. Punch, in politics, is all for the Four P's—Principle, Progress, Patriotism
and Peace. But these have, in the interest of the Publio, to be interpreted and
applied by a fifth P,—Punch himself, to wit. For behold the bearings even of
these super-excellent things lie in their application.
Principle, as applied by the Doctrinaires, means dogmatic Dead-lock in
national aotion, fiscal fetish-worship, and the palsying dictatorship of the
Political Procustes.
Progress, as applied by the fanatio Socialist, means not the speed that wins,
of the trained racer, hut the pace that kills, of the runaway colt.
Patriotism — sweet and honourable name! — applied by cock-a-doodling
Chauvinism, comes to signify the selfish, short-sighted swagger with which
the
agmatical Non-inter-
to be followed by the
the Music-Hail Jingo sickens all men of sense and
feeling.
Whilst Peace, applied b
ventionist, is the policy of
fate of the treed Coon.
For the clear interpretation, sparkling illumination, and
proper limitation of the Four P's, Mr. Punch refers the
Publio to his own pages, pattim.
Mr. Punch advocates all the Liberty that each man can
have without infringing the freedom of another, all the
Peace that is possible without forfeiting the right to war
against insolent aggression and grinding iniquity, all the
Economy that is consistent with keeping our powder dry.
Bathe would come down like a Thor hammer on lust and
licence, fight, as sturdy Ton Hughes has it, while he
could stand and see, for right, independence, and honour,
and kiok to unlimited Limbo any Government whatsoever
that for one day would endanger Britain's fleet-guarded
safety for the sake of a popular Budget. Rooey-Tooey!
Mr. Punch would cherish " Our Boys " of British blood
in our world-sprinkling Colonies as the very apple of the
national eye, the very core of the national heart. Any
political Squeers who proposes to stint or snub thete Boys
of ours may expect from Mr. Punch's baton a larrupping
to whioh the flagellation administered by the indignant
Nicholas was a mere trifle.
He would, in fact, allow the'Empire to be disintegrated
as little by flouting the faithful as by knuckling under to
the disloyal.
These be the main outlines of a National Policy, com-
pared with whioh such things] as naughtily obstructive
Lords, Retaliatory Tariffs, Land Allotments, Local Option,
and Disestablishment to-day or to-morrow, are if not
exactly leather and prunella, at least matters of minor
importance and urgency.
Mr. Punch may be trusted to deal with that Jack-in-
the-box Bogey Protection, wheresoever and whensoever it
pops up its foolish head, in his own deoisive way. Bat
he will also recognise the fact, sometimes forgotten by
Doctrinaires that starving] stomachs can't be fed with
formulas.
He will take due "care that the reasonable freedom of
the temperate drinker shall not be sacrificed to the doubt-
ful needs of the drunkard.
As to the Lords—well, they had better mind their eyes
—or rather, their ayes and noes—for Mr. Punch's is on
them.
Concerning that troublesome trio, Lord Lanbgrabber,
Alderman Pocketek, and Mr. Bumble, phengh 1 there's
a bad time coming, boys, for them, whioh, however, will
be a good time for everybody else, Monopolies, Rings,
and porochial" potterers have notice to quit and
must go.
This Address is not directed to Little Pedlington, nor
calculated for the latitude of Hole-cum-Corner. It is
delivered urine t orbi, to all Nations and to all Nationalities.
Let Princes heed it and Peoples will be happy! Let Peoples
observe it, and Parties will be at peace! For him who unites
the Votes of all, Crowned Heads, as well as others, must
give their Voices. The European Concert shall become a
harmonious reality, whose ensemble might move Strauss
to envy and Godfrey to emulation, when its various per-
formers obey the baton, and play up to the Pan-pipes of
the great International Conductor, Mr. Bandmaster
Punch. Rooey- Tooey!
Ladies and Gentlemen, there you are! I do not hope
shortly to have the honour of spouting to you from every
platform in the country. See you all dephlogistioated first I
Mr. Punch only speaks from his own platform, and that
he does not only at Election time, but every week all the
year round. So that you all have ever at hand an unfail-
ing fount of political wisdom, and a certain antidote to the
countless columns of blather, and blarney, and bunkum,
and blare and bounce you are constrained to read—or hear
—in your several localities. And a good thing for you all
that it is so, or surely you would get speechified into a
political calenture, and,plunging blindly and despairingly,
drown fathom deep in the ocean of vain verbosity.
As to " hoping I may enjoy the high privilege of repre-
senting you —risum teneatxs amici t Why affect to specu-
late on a foregone conclusion f Only this remember, that
whiohever Party be returned to office, Mr. Punch, the
non-partisan Member for Everywhere, will be in power I
For therein lies the chief hope of Everybody I

VERB. SAP.
{A Remonstrance and an Explanation, for the benefit of some kind
Friends—and others—at a distance.)
Haying received several letters from well-meaning readers on the
subject of a small picture in the last number but two, headed "A
Fact," we, on behalf of the ever charitably-disposed Mr. Punch,
beg to say that Mr. P. is astonished at any of his friends for one
moment supposing bim capable of selecting a sacred theme as a suit-
able subject for jesting. What did such correspondents, if Liberals,
think of Lord Randolph's comparing Mr. Gladstone s manifesto
to the Authorised Version, or, if Conservatives, of Lord Rosebert, at
Edinburgh, adapting a question from the Gospel narrative to hisjown
particular case, which quotation is reported to .have been received
with "laughter"?
But it being a part of Mr. Punch's recognised mission, as a satirist, to
come down sharply upon all exhibitions of cant, and therefore from
time to time, as occasion may arise, on those smug, ignorant, self-
elected teachers who vulgarise Scriptural texts by using them as
their stock-in-trade phrases, he was not sorry to reoord pietorially an
instance, respeotably vouched for as " a fact," of one of these obtru-
sively sanctimonious gentry receiving a smart and telling rebuff
from an honestly indignant English yeoman.
Hani soit qut mat y pense; and Mr. P. wishes us to say thus
much, and no more, on this subject, though for ourselves, and for our
own part, we will add one word on another matter, and that is d
propos of a "legend" to a Scotch pioture, where undue prominence
was given to " poor letter ' H' ". Now, in the " proof-slip," we
altered1' H "into "to the ," thus softening down the American
Landowner's strong expression to something which would be fitter for
ears and eyes polite. But this " slip" by the merest accident,—by
another "slip,"—did not reach the Printer's hands. Perhaps the
Printer's Devil—" intervening" like the Queen's Prootor—laid an
embargo on it. Anyhow, that slip only reappeared too late to be of
any use; for the Printer, as an educated man, unaccustomed to
omitting his "H's," naturally retained this one in its place, where it
was discovered when past praying for.
Sincerely, at that moment, did we feel for the trouble of mind
which a sin of omission, a want of sufficient oare in revision, as he
has since explained, caused Mr. Edmund Yates, when a certain para-
graph from a trusted contributor, after it had been marked by him for
condemnation, suddenly appeared in his journal, "unbeknown " to
himself. Heavy was his punishment for this; very heavy, as it appears
to us now, compared with a sentence recently pronounced in a case preg-
nant with far more serious consequences. Fancy, we said to ourselves,
if instead of only an aspirate which is "whispered in Heaven," but
"muttered" elsewhere, it had been a libel! Well, well, we are all
human,—with a capital "H," and a reminiscence of Haugustus
Human-nature Hah his,—and having erred, we hasten, propria
motu, to do penance in this sheet, and hold a candle to—no, that's
wrong again — Qui s'excuse s'accuse, et nous nous en accusons.
We prefer this course. We like to be 'umble sometimes, and
don't often get the chance of apologising for a "big big D ," which
we might have been pardoned for uttering, when the big big H"
caught 'our observant eye, after we, in our misplaced confidence,
thought that it had been disposed of once and for ever.
A MODEST FLOWER.
With the rattling educational cry of the Sohool Board Election still
loud in our ears, there is something almost soothing in turning to a
little volume of unpretending childish rhyme that has reached—so it
is stated on its title-page—its thirtieth edition. The little volume
in question, entitled The Daisy, or Cautionary Stories in Verse,
adapted to the ideas of children from four to eight years old, ex-
plains its appearance by stating that "with the recent revival of
interest in the earlier publications for children, there have arisen
inquiries for The Cowslip and The Daisy, whioh have for years
been little in demand." It is not, perhaps, surprising to find that
there has been no very pressing demand for The Daisy, and the
absence of any acute agitation for its republication speaks well for
the dominant sense of the interval during which its reputation has
been suffered to lapse; and it is not easy to understand the nature
of that recent "revival of interest in the earlier publications for
children" that has provoked its reappearance. That in the year
1806, when it was written, its "cautionary " verses may have been
"adapted to the ideas of children from four to eight years old'' need
not now be questioned; but it must be confessed that for the chil-
dren of 1886, accustomed to Little Folks' literature, the ideas in
question, ana their execution, both in pen and pencil, appear to
offer somewhat meagre fare. Still there is a straight-forward sim-
plicity about the Cl Stories" that is not without its charm. What,
for instance, can be more direct and epigrammatic than—we quote
at random—the following, entitled, "Naughty Sam" t
Tom and Chari.es once took a walk
To see a pretty lamb,
And, as they went, began to talk
Of little naughty Sam,
Who beat his younger brother, Will,
And threw him in the dirt;
And when his poor Mamma was ill
He teased her for a squirt.
"And I," said Tom, " won't play with Sam,
Although he has a top;
But here the pretty little
lamb
To talking put a stop.
As, however, two-and-thirty "cautionary stories," of which the
above may be regarded as an average specimen, and which are aocom-
Eanied by woodcuts of the period, comprise The Daisy, it may fairly
e conceived that those who have been making inquiries about it will,
when their inquisitiveness is satisfied by a perusal of its pages, need
something a little stronger in backbone, and more in harmony with
the thoughts and ideas of the day.
For instance, the naughty boy of the hour in any " cautionary"
sense needs a much more robust handling than that awarded to
Naughty Sam. The mere idea of throwing his younger brother in the
mud. and bothering his invalid mother for a squirt, would be quite
insufficient to supply the sensational environments of the modern
He would nave to be dealt with, say thus, as
pickle.
SPITEFUL PETER.
Young Pbtbr was
bo full of spite,
That he, without
remorse,
Procured a ton of
dynamite,
And blew up Cha-
ring Cross.
And when Police-
man A. discerned
The upshot of his
vice,
To Peter's Nurse
he sadly turned,
And said, "This
isn't nice.
"Young gentlemen
who life begin
By giving folks a
shock,
May someday find themselves within
A common felon's dock."
Then again, the typical "promising child" suggests much greater
breadth of treatment than is furnished by the level pages of The
Daisy. In these days of over-pressure the opportunity should not
be missed of investing the pioture with dramatic foroe in this obvious
direction. What, for instance, could be more to the purpose than
the subjoined little " cautionary " poem:—

"Tia pleasing to
Tiny Jem,
Whose age is un-
der two,
Floor the Binomial
Theorem

There are, of course, a host of other subjects that suggest them-
selves; but the above will serve to show what could be done in the
direction indicated. A happy combination of strict simplicity of
diction and vigour of illustration is all that is needed to follow up
The Daisy with an appropriate sequel, that would certainly be far
more adapted to the ideas of modern children of from four to eight
years old than the mild pabulum whioh apparently satisfied our
grandfathers. We make Messrs. Griffith, Farban & Co., the
enterprising Publishers, a present of the suggestion.

CALLING THEM HOME.
Horn! Hoho! The call resounds
Afar o'er rook and heather;
'Tis time from pasture's farthest bounds
To call the flock together.
They 'ye rambled wide since morning's prime,
Unchecked by crook or collie;
To let them stray beyond their time
Would show the Shepherd's folly.
Hoho! Hoho! With oall and crook
He shouts and signals. Readily
They tumble up from byre and nook,
The old ones trotting steadily,
Home to his feet as oft of old,
That well-known voice obeying;
To find within the anoient fold
An end to frolio straying.
And if of youngsters one or two
Seem yet inclined to gambol,
The oall, the crook, will oheck them too
In their too venturous ramble.
That Shepherd knows his art too well
To let them wildly wander,
Or far from the bell-wether's bell
To stray from here to yonder.
He all day through hath still reclined,
And let them feed at leisure;
And one would rove at his sweet mind,
And one would leap at pleasure.
But now that folding-hour 'a at hand,
He rises from the heather.
And summonses the woolly band
Back home to bond and tether.
Though one or two be wild of will,
To seek fresh pastures loving,
They '11 follow the Old Shepherd still,
For all their taste for roving.
He knows, however far they roam,
His rallying call will find them;
Like Bo-Peep s sheep, they '11 ail come home,
And bring their tails behind them!
THE VOTE OF THE RED AND THE BLUE.
(A Tragic Sequel to a recent Legal Decision.)
Colonel Pipeclay asked for the Adjutant.
"Please, Sir," returned the Sergeant-
Major, "Mr. Awdley-Roome's gone can-
vassing. He won't be here until after the
Election."
The Colonel bit two inches off his mous-
tache, but kept his temper. "Where's the
Majors f " was his next inquiry.
"Please, Sir, standing for the Division,"
was the prompt reply. "Mr. Awdley-Roome
told me, Sir, that you had struck them off
duty, to that they might attend to their
political affairs."
"Ah! to be sure—so I did, so I did! Bless
the Election!" And another inch of the
Colonel's moustache was bitten off. Then,
seeing that the non-commissioned officer still
lingered, the Commander asked, "Well, Ser-
geant-Major, do you want anything?"
"Please, Sir, after I have sounded for the
parade, may I nave leave f I have promised
to take the chair this afternoon at a meeting
at which the Senior Major is to address his
constituents, subject to your permission."
"Very well," replied Colonel Pipeclay.
And the Sergeant-Major saluted, and retired.
Five minutes later, the Commander of the
Battalion appeared in the barrack-square.
"Hallo I ' he exclaimed, in astonishment,
"Where's the Regiment t"
"Please, Sir, they 're all away at the Elec-
tion," replied a voice, apparently proceeding
from the guardhouse.
"Who's that addressing me?" asked
Colonel Pipeclay, looking round, and dis-
covering no one.
"Please, Sir, the Prisoner." And the
solitary occupant of the guardhouse brought
himself to "attention" in his cell.
"Well, Prisoner, you and I seem to be the
only people on parade. What's the meaning
of all this r" atked the Colonel through the
bars of the small window.
"Please, Sir, I heard that Major Black,
commanding the Right Half-Battalion, had
given leave to his companies A, B, C, and D
to hear him lecture on Conservatism, while
Major White had ordered his Half-Battalion
to hear him speak on the Radical programme."
Another two inohes of the Colonel's mous-
tache were sacrificed. Then he called out
angrily for a bugler.
Verry sorry, Sir," replied a Polioe-con-
stable, who happened to be passing, " but the
whole of the Drums and Fifes have been run
in by the Sohool Board. As for your Offioers,
they, like the Adjutant, are all canvassing.

Pipeclay. "All voting against one another! What will beoome of
discipline!"
"By the new Aot, Sir," replied the Police-constable, "discipline
is suspended till after the Election."
Before the Colonel had time to make an angry but suitable reply,
a telegram from the Horse- Guards signed " Cambridge" was handed
to him for perusal. The despatch ran as follows:—
"General Order. Soldiers' vote sending Service to customary
destination; only, as I hate strong language, don't swear!"
And Colonel Pipeclay being a good soldier (and knowing that
obedience to a superior is a good soldier'sfirst duty) didn't! But the
effort to repress utterance of his vigorous thoughts was too muoh for
him, and he died of spontaneous combustion. And he was buried
with military honours—after the Election!
LORD MARE'S DAY.
Hearing from my old frend the Oildhall Beedle, who told it me
with allmost a tear in his two eyes, as how as the old onered Coppera-
shun, tired out with their constant worry fust with one Ome Seck-
retary who wonted to reduse 'em to a meer Westry, and then with

another Ome Seckretary who wonts to put the quite common Bored
of Works—who ain't not got ewen no Magasine Gownds and no Field
Marshall, let alone a pair of Sherryff b and a Sword Bearer—over their
old and ancient heds, had, to speak the powerful langwidge of the
Sportin World, "thrown hup the Spunge," and fearing therefore|that
this here Lord Mare's hallowed Show might be the werry last, I oon-
seeved sitoh a idea as ony oums to us in our extremitys.
"Yes, Robkbt," I sea to myself, "if this is to be the hend of
ewerythink in the Show line, jine in it, and form a part of it, so as
future ages of all kinds may say wen speaking sorrowfully of it, I'm
glad as Robert was there, it was fitting as he shond be. I had no
diffyculty in gaining my hobjeot. I nose seweral of the Eppin Forest
Keepers, so 1 marched wiotoryously along with them as far as the
butiful Griffing, and then quietly slipping down in Chancery Lane
got back to my dooty without not never being mist. Having taken
my last final farewell, probberbly, of the werry grandist specktackle
of moddern times, if we exoeps the Drury Lane Pantomtne, I felt
just a leetle down on my luck, as the Bishop said when the Larndress
soorched his lorn sleeves, but a glass or too of my faverit Mydeary
Ent me all right, and I set about my arduous duties with my usual
energy. The washupfool Company of Grumblers was present in
rayther greater force than usual, they grumbled because the horses
that drawed the four City Company's hemblems was only werry
common Cart Horses 1 Of coarse they expected as Lord Rothschild
woud have lent about 20 of his race horses for the hinteresting oerry-
mony I Then at the Bankwet they grumbled at the T artel soup

Maraskino in the Jelly nex, insted of we nose what.
Most of us Waiters and Common Counslers being starnch Con-
serwatifs has been a looking forward for some time to see our old
frends cum amongst us again and cheer us hup a little, as we sadly
wants it, so Her Madjesty's Ministers was receeved with plenty of
ohairs as they marched up to be presented with appy arts and
smilin faces. And didn't their bran new unyforms look lovely, why
in freshness and Bhinyness they was amost ekwal to the Lord Mare s
own footmen's livverys, and that's about as big a complement as even
an Hed Waiter could pay even to a Conserwatif Ministry. The
Company was a werry brilliant one, speshally the Ladys, and as for
the Dimons they was that numerus and that dazzlin? that the gas
all seemed wasted. Brown, who was wunce in the Pornbrokenng
line, and so ort to know sumthink about their wally, said as how as
he thort he shoud put it down at jest about a million, if they was all
reel. But there's no imperanoe as Brown isn't capable of.
We was all a good deal disapinted with the Prime Minister's speech.
He torked a long while about a lot of forren things as nobody didn't
seem to care muoh about, for they was as silent as the Toom, and two
or three on 'em was acshally fast asleep. But he rowsed 'em up a bit
towards the hend wen he sed as he hoped to see lots more Lord
Mares with all their ushul splender and with nobody to hinterfere
with their goings on. If I mite without harrogance put in jest a
word, it wood be, them's my sentiments to a Tea.
The Lord Mare looked splendid, as usual, and so did the Rite
Honnerabel the Lady Maress with her nice Sweet of Pink Pearls.
It's eBtonishing how all Lord Mares cuts out their Four Fathers.
He didn't care about speaking Greek all nite, as he mite easily
have done, of coarse, so he spoke French, jest like a Nativet witch of
coarse estonished 'em, jest as Natives easily is. Brown said as how
if the French Embassador had bin there be would have spoken of
him as a Man and a Brother, and have called him Mar Mare I
The Judges maid us all larf with their fun, to which their comioal
apearance gave a hextra relish. The Lord Chanceseller—who that
rude and w-ulger Brown said reminded him of Mr. Toole when in his
prime—made 'em all rore by Bain as they might as well expek
tears from a flint stone as good law from him, and that he did not
intend to erbolish primeoginytur. The Master of the Rolls—who
Brown tried to perswade me was Master of the Bakers Company,
but I know'd better—told 'em that if he attempted to be serious there,
nobody woudn't beleeve him. His brother Judges was all different
from one another exoep in one thing and that was, they was all as
clever as the cleverest man as ever lived ?—Tork about oheek! said
Bbown—and though they differed they never made use of bad lang-
widge, like some people ne ooud name, nor called each other norty
names. One or two of the gents at the top table tried to larf, but I
sumhow thinks it was ony to hide their tell-tail blushes. The Tumey
General said as how it was the duty of the Bar to keep the Judges
Straight, but they was sitch a rampagious lot that it made it a werry
difficult thing to do, but they meant to keep on a trying though they
knowed as it was amost a hopeless task! After these jolly Lawyers
had finished with their capital oharff, the rest of the Speakers seemed
a werry sollem lot, so amost everybody got up and went away.
I got thro mvofishal duties as quick as possible and got into the
Libery to see the Judges' quodreel, as Brown told me was about to
be dansed by the Lord Chanceseller, the Master of the Rolls, Mr.
Judge Lopes, and Mr. Sargent Robinson, with the four prettyest
Ladys of the Lady Maress's sweet, but I was two late for wunce,
witch I was werry sorry for, as I shoud think it must have bin about

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
■XTRACTID PROM

THE DIAEY OF TOBY, M.P.
Wednetday, Kov. 18.—Dissolution day. Here when Parliament
opened; come down to see the last of it. A very different scene.
Then a crowd coming and going, talking and laughing, shaking
hands and wagging heads. Now an empty Chamber, ghostly looking
in holland covers, an empty Chair, silent benohes, and a damp Novem-
ber atmosphere. Also, there are ghosts—any number of ghosts,
though not all of dead men. There's Gladstone walking up to be
sworn in, advancing with long strides, making low obeisance to the
Chair amid the rapturous cheering of the host of his supporters. Full
of hope and life and energy; going to do greater things than ever:
an invincible majority at hie back; no fear of dissensions ; all united
under the greatest leader of modern times, not yet known as the
Grand Old Man.
Behind, standing at the Bar with hands outstretched, is a burly
figure, which asks with plaintive voioe, "What are you going to do
with me'(" This is Bradlatjgh, destined presently to test the unity
of the majority. On his right, in the corner seat, on the Front Benoh
below the Gangway, sits a youth, whose pallid face betokens much
burning of the midnight oil. He sits and truculently twirls his
moustache. Next to him, seated on the extreme edge of the bench,
with arms folded across his chest, hat tilted over his forehead, a
personage of diplomatic mien regards the soene through his spectacles.
Particularly watches effeot upon the Premier. Sir Stafford
Nokthcote, physically making as little of himself as possible, sits
with a hand up either sleeve, and head bowed down on the chest.
After a while the ghost at the Bar walks towards the table: another,
slighter in form dressed in black shorts and pointed-tail coat, with
frills at his wrists and a sword at his side, glides on to the scene. He
and Buadlauou pirouette up and down the floor before an amazed
and excited legislature.
Hastington lounges in with one hand in his pocket, and hat
swinging in the other. Behind him, steadily overtaking him with
rapid pace, comes Lord Frederick Cavendish with something that,
through the ghostly atmosphere, looks like a stain of blood on his
chest. Bright takes his old seat on the Treasury Benoh. Chamber-
lain and Dilke, with characteristic modesty, seat themselves at the
remote obsourer end, waiting for the voice (for populi) that shall
say, "Friends, go up higher." Habcocrt sits and smiles softly to
himself. Forstkr spreads himself half over the bench, shouldering
even lower down yet, the^meek and unaggressive President of the
Board of Trade.
Nearly six years ago these figures and others oame and went
full of bustle and life. Now they have all vanished, and nothing
is left but the silent Chamber, the flitting ghosts, and the ghastly
brown holland covering that looks as if it hid whole rows of
corpses.

THE G. 0. M. ON ARTISTS' MODELS.
We are entirely unauthorised to state
that Mr. Horsley, If.A., has received a
letter from Mr. Gladstone, "werry much
applauding what he'd done," or rather
what he had said about unclothed models in
Art Schools. The Right Honourable Gentle-
man says he has no rooted antipathy to the
Naked Truth, and sees no objection to
Truth, when in a state of nudity, remaining
in the Well, which well he would leave
alone. But Truth out of the Well is evi-
dently another matter, and should be, as
Mr. Hoeslet would have the models, well
wrapped up. The G. 0. M. quite under-
stands how painful it must be to Mr. Hobs-
let' 8 feelings to travel about the country
at this time of year, as he is doing, in
search of Pictures for the Winter Loan
Exhibition of Old Masters, in consequence
of the trees being stript.
There was once a political phrase, which
had a temporary sucoess, it was "meddle
and muddle;" and Mr. Gladstone, while
deprecating all attempts to give bis mean-
ing any other colouring than the Artist
would approve, yet thinks that if " Meddle
and.Model" were just now remembered it
would be well for all lovers of Art who have
some regard for its encouragement in the dim
future. Mr. Gladstone kindly remonstrates
with the high-minded, but somewhat too

severe, Artist for having, as he had been informed,—and if wrongly informed he would apolo-
gise beforehand and withdraw the observation,—dismissed a country servant, who, on being
asked if he recognised a landscape of Mr. Hobsley's, replied that " He knew'd it at once.
The sound of "knew'd" was, of course, objectionable, but the Right Honourable Gentleman
expressed himself convinoed that the humble possessor of the 8ervice-f ranchise erred ignorantly,
and not wilfully, and, therefore, if it had so happened, he begged he might be reinstated.
Finally, Mr. Gladstone observes that his recent huskiness suggested his addressing the
eminent Artist, as the sound of his own voice had reminded him that he was less like speaking
Gladstone than "speaking Horslet."
A Correction.—We are bound by Christian courtesy to give every one credit for the
highest motives, though we may condemn their conduct. So that, when at the end of a lively
article in the Daily Telegraph of last Friday on projects for establishing " hostels " for City
Clerks, we read that " there is but one radioally effective remedy for bachelor loneliness, and
that, unfortunately, many members of the useful and honourable guild of City Clerks are,
from financial reasons, unable to secure—a wife,"—we may suggest that the writer would
have made his real meaning dearer, if, instead of the vague recommendation to take "a
wife" (i.e. some wife, any wife), he had substituted the verb "to.marry."

Herr Peiniger playing Varia-
tions on the Contango, or
Bach-wardation movement.
A LITTLE MUSIC.
Vkrt pleasant evening at Herr Peiniger's Second Reoital. Inter-
esting programme, though at first sight rather serious, the commence-
ment being Grimm. This was from his
"Op. 14." An 'Arrt observed that he
supposed this was intended for dance-
music, and wanted to know if Ohimm
gave many "'Ops " during the season.
The Analyst in his published re-
marks,—price, with programme, six-
pence, and cheap at that, — says:—
"There is an element of broad humour
in the inversion of the three notes already
indicated, i.e., c D c on the violin, and,
by way of the tu quoque, the piano re-
torts c B c, and vice vend."
Isn't this real fun P The audience
was convulsed—respectably and quietly,
of course: doing what Mr. Weller Senior
tried ineffectually to practise—" a silent
ohuokle."
Subsequently, the Analyst remarking
on Bach's " Ctaccona in D minor,"—
if Bach had been a great traveller, he
might- have written. something in Asia
Minor, but he didn't,—says that Variation 16 is " of a character so
full of repose, and anthem-like "—yes, we were'almost asleep, like a
Dean, quia bien dine, in a Cathe-
dral stall,—" that one is sorry to
be drawn along with the next
variation into the bustle of figu-
ration again."
As this suggested a Milliner's
Measure and a Dress-Improver,
we woke up, and looked about
for her appearance on the plat-
form, but we were disappointed.
We heard "the bustle of figura-
tion " to the end, were delighted
with Herr Peiniger in his Airs
Hongrois" (" used to have Pom-
made Hongrois for my 'airs," said
Arrt, but he was immediately
'ushed down), and when four
Violinists got up together, and
began to attack an Andante and a
Rondino, we thought it was time
to retire, and so we did, but it was
the last selection, and then out
we went, and out went the lights. So home to bed with great content.

that it is a question whether this dignity could not be appropriately
oonferred on either Mr. Gte or Mr. Mapleson,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Art of the Stapex by Perot Fitzgerald (published by
Remington & Co.). This is a Collection of Charles Lamb's Essays,
with a Commentary by Perct Fitzgerald. These Lamb-ohops with
mint-sauce are dedicated, cddly enough, as far as the name goes, to
Mr. Pig-ott. With the
Essays everyone is more
or less familiar; and Mr.
Fitzgerald's commentary
adds nothing to them
except a Commentary. All
Shakspearian students will
agree with Charles Lamb,
and also with Mr. Perct
Fitzgerald, who has the
advantage over the de-
lightful Essayist in posses-
sing a practical knowledge
of the modern Stage, and
a further advantage in
being alive to write about
it. A student of Shax-
speare gifted with keen
dramatic instinct, whether
he be a player or no, will
not only meditate upon the
poetry, try to think out
every line, and gain an
insight into every charac-
ter, Dut will also attempt
to realise, in his mind's
eye, the scenes in action.
Shaxspeare'8 Dramas, to
be thoroughly appreciated,
must be studied with the
heart of a Poet and the
eye of a Stage-Manager.
An intelligent and ex-
perienced Actor may throw great light apon some otherwise
unintelligible passage by the invention of appropriate stage-business
which, it will be at once felt, was the one thing wanting to complete
the Scene.
But this is equally true of all plays of which we do not possess the
"prompt copies," or where the details of the action have not been
most carefully provided and written down. Mr. Irving in his study
can put down all the business for all the characters in Hamlet from
beginning to end, and how few comparatively would take the trouble
to read the laborious compilation when published! But in three
hours they can be impressed with a clearer view of how Mr. Irving
thinks the play of Hamlet ought to be represented, by visiting the
Lyceum Theatre, than ever they could by studying day after day
such an "acting edition" as we have just imagined. They may or
may not agree with Mr. Irving's views, hut, on the whole, the
majority of those who are fairly well up in the play will enjoy the
performance more for that very reason; and the fact of their having
seen the play intelligently performed, will add a zest to their next
perusal of it in the privacy of their own study.
If we had no theatres, and suddenly discovered the plays of Shak-
speare, there would be a national subscription, or, in these days, a
Limited Liability Company immediately formed, for the purpose of
building a theatre for their special production. We should not be
content merely to read them: we should want to see them in action.
What Charles Lamb, who was not much of a dramatist himself,
does not seem to value sufficiently is, the undeniable fact that these
plays were written to be performed, not to be read, and the characters
were in many cases, notably that of Hamlet, written to suit certain
members of Shaespeare's Company. We fancy Mr. Fitzgerald
has missed this point—or we have overlooked it, in reading his com-
mentary, whioh, by the way, is written in a pleasant chatty style, |
and if it does no more than promote a general re-reading of Htia's
Essays, it will have served a good purpose.
A Christmas Angel.—We protest against Mr. Fabjeon getting us
to take him into our houses with his Christmas Angel, and then in
return taking us in, and making us weep and Bnivel and blow our
noses, and giving us red eyes and violent colds in our heads. It isn't
kind, Mr. Fabjeon. Such Angels' visits are fortunately few and
Far(jeon) between, so it will be another twelve months before he
dares to do it again. There is yet another month to Christmas, bo our
advice is, read this book—a beautiful little book it is, though a bit
cloudy and mysterious at first,—before Christmas comes, and then
Set something to make you laugh, for Mr. Fabjeon's Angel will not
o this. Very much to the contrary. Most of the illustrations, by
Gordon Brown, are full of oharacter, but here and there a little too
"frenchy " in style for truthful representations of low Cockney types. I

A CRY FROM EPPING FOREST.
I want to thank you, good Mr. Punch, for what you have said
on our behalf. Things have lately gone very hard with us. We felt
they were really beyond a joke.
For hundreds and hundreds of years, we fallow Deer have had free
range of Epping Forest. When the Ancient Britons were mere begin-
ners, we were here. Since time was, the Forest has been "fallow"
ground. What is happening to us now no Fallow can understand I
Dear Mr. Punch we are not being killed—that would be meroiful,
aud we are but venison. At the Civio "hunts" you have heard
about we are literally tortured to death. Does tho thing your City
calls its Corporation possess bowels of compassion Y If it is not quite
callous to the agony indicted in its name, it will stop, once and for
ever, the ghastly "sport" of the past season.
My Sire lies rotting in the Forest. Flying one morning last Sep-
tember before a band of yelling beaters, one of his legs was smashed
below the knee by a Cockney "sportsman's" chance shot. My
lamed Sire made for a near brook, flowing through a deep hollow in
the wood. Here at night we came to him. The ball had smashed
the bone to splinters. At first he crept from place to place along the
brook, leaving a track of blood. TheD, as the wound grew worse, he
lay in the deepest water, and died on the fifth day. Some nights

the last moment. When he rose, it was knownthat the majority was
safe, if not overwhelming, and upon Harcouh^ whispering this to
him, he determined on his course. Peroration magnificent. "What

dim and distant future has suddenly burnt upon us, luminous and
dear in the distinct and pressing present." Then he heat round
beautifully and acknowledging the magnftudAof the responsibility,
oonfessed himself quite willing to accept it. He closed amid ringiag
cheers. The result, a majority of 136. Sothanquestion is settled for
good and aye. On my way home, threw' a brickbat through the
Vicar's study-window, just to celebrate the event, and give him a
foretaste of to-morrow's news.

Controversy still hot as to the best way of appropriating the surplus
of the two hundred and fifty millions realised^ by the sale of Church
property. "The National and Educational Musio. Halls for the
People scheme, with free drink up to sixpence, land admission gratis,
seems not half-bad, and as a chastening progressive social factor
ought to work well. Might be amended, perhaps, in Committee.

Being Sunday, looked in this afternoon into Westminster Abbey,
to see how the old place strikes one under its new conditions. Effect
curious at first. Little tea and coffee-tables in rows right away up
the nave strike one as quaint and almost out of h>laoe, but the eye
soon grows familiar with them. Building fairly ^ull, of loungers.
Has been leased for three years to the " Westminster Intellectual
Sunday Improvement League," and they are apparently tryiag a
tentative and not altogether unattractive programme. When I
looked in, somebody with a stick was lecturing from the pulpit on
the habits of the Megatherium, illustrated by diagrams let down in
front of the screen. People not very much interested. The whole
entertainment enlivened by occasional performances on the organ of
Old English Airs and selections from popular Comic Operas, the latter,
when recognised, being accompanied by the audience. On coming
out, found the Dean, surrounded by one or two Minor Canons, holding
forth to a large but decently-behaved mob on the iniquity of the
whole thing, within the railings of the enclosure. He appeared to be
denouncing the League, and sending round his hat for half-pence.
General attitude of the public apathetic. Took St. Paul's on my way
home. Heard a bit of a discourse from a popular Atheist. It did
not seem to go down. Benches pretty well empty. Thought I saw
Liddon behind a column taking notes, so perhaps he will reply in a
letter to to-morrow's Times. Shall look out.

Disturbances of dispossessed Country Clergy appear to continue.

a Rural Dean, to protest against "the confiscation of the sacred
fabrics," dispersed, after the reading of the Riot Act by the local
military. Suppose something ought to be done for them. But

disappearance of the coal, blanket, clothing, and benefit clubs that
have vanished everywhere with the country vicars and their wives.
They don't seem to accept the National Country Inquiry Committee's
Agent as an equivalent, although, on investigation, he is empowered
to render temporary assistance in extreme cases of necessity, when
he meets with them. The abolishing of the Country Clergy has
undoubtedly opened up a perplexing problem for solution.

Things seem to be going very hard with Church dignitaries. Was
much snocked this morning to see a bevy of Bishops, in their worn-
out aprons and battered shovel-hats, parading the street, and joining
in the chorus, " We've got no work to do." I sent them out a loaf
of bread and a shilling, and they seemed, poor fellows! quite grate-
ful. Really, if I had fully taken in all the dire consequences of
Disestablishment, I do not think I should have voted for it. How-
ever, what is done is done, and there's no help for it. But it is a
sad thing to think those Bishops will, in all probability, come on to
the rates. Such a future is indeed dim, but, I fear, not distant I

GENUINE ENTHUSIASM.
PAPER-KNIFE POEMS.
By Our Special Book-Marker.
"A Journal Kept by DirK Doyle
in 1840."
'Trs more than forty years ago,
The world was not so old, you know,
And we were young—I fancy so—
And life was fresh and vernal:
Years, years before one used to see.
In Punch, the monogram " It D.,"
Or, Mr. Pips his Diarie—
Was written Dick Doyle's Journal.'
Here cunning youthful finders trace,
A scene, a show, a well-known place,
A oharacter, a form, a face,
With quaint remark diurnal:
What graceful fancy and whit h» a't!
What truth, what humour, and what
Art I
And all that Genius can impart,
We find in Dick Doyle's Jutrnal'.
Shrewd is the Artist and einct:
It would appear he oould extract
From passing folly, fashion, fact,
The essenoe and the kernel:
And, as you linger o'er the page,
that chronicles a byegone aire,
You '11 leave no picture, I '11 engage,
Unscanned in Dick Doyle's Jour-
nal!
'Mid " Journals," I have ne'er found
one
Throuehout so admirably done;
.So full of honest, boyish fun,
And spirits sempiternal!
There's not a page that's dull or dry—
A baok you ought at once to huj'—
So quick to Smith & Elder fly,
And order Dick Doyle's Journal.
"KIND INQUIRIES."
A Correspondent having called Lord Harttngton'b attention to
a speech by the Tory Candidate for West Cramtown, in which his
Lordship was stated to be a "Communist in disguise, and a secret
friend of all the most desperate of the Continental Nihilists," Lord
Hartington's Secretary writes that his Lordship is glad to supple-
ment the information given. Not only is he a Communist and
Nihilist, but he was the person who set fire to the Tuileries, murdered
the late Czab, and materially assisted Gut Fawkes in his spirited
but premature attempt to introduce the Cloture into Parliament.
A Gentleman in Essex has written the following letter to Mr.
Bright:—
Sib.—Is it or is it not a fact that a prisoner at Portland in the years
1843-6 had exactly the same Christian and surname as yourself t Is
it also a fact that on one occasion when Mr. Cobden and yourself
were both to address a meeting on Free Trade, you purposely elbowed
that gentleman, pretending that it was a pure accident, over the edge
of the platform, whereby he sustained a fracture of the knee-oap, all
in order that you might occupy first place in the attention of your
audience P As my uncle's father-in-law knew a man who was at the
meeting, you see my information is indisputably correct.
Yours indignantly,
A Birmingham Elector.
Mr. Bright has forwarded the following reply :—
Pochdale, Nov.
Sib,—Yon are evidently some new form of jackass. Mr. Cobden
never had a fracture of the knee-cap in his life. John Bright.
A Correspondent, having invited Mr. Gladstone "to explain, if
he can, the fact that he is at the present moment the part-owner of
valuable Gold Mines, in the neighbourhood of Widdin, which accounts
for his disapproval of the 8ervian invasion of that province," has
reoeived a reply to this effeot:—
"Mr. Gladstone bees to acknowledge the letter from a Gentle-
man signing himself,' Not to be Humbugged Easily.' He has made
it a rule never to answer silly calumnies of any sort, and only does so
now because he finds it impossible to adhere to his rnle for more than
five consecutive minutes. Mr. Gladstone is surprised at the state-
ments of his Correspondent. At this period of the electoral contfst
he will not allow himself to be dragged into a discussion on Gold
Mines, or any other mines. He may, however, adduce one or two
reasons why his Correspondent's assertion is a priori improbable. In
Mr. Gladstone's belief, Bulgarian Law does not admit of part-owner-
ship of any kind; he, moreover, is not aware that there are Gold
M ines in the vicinity of Widdin, but on this point expresses no deoided
opinion. If all these arguments are inconclusive, he finally saj s,
what perhaps might have been placed at the beginning of this com-
munication, that as a matter-of-fact he does not own, or | art-own.
Gold Mines near Widdin, or anywhere else, and the statement th.t
he does so, is false."
The subjoined correspondence has also been sent to us for publi-
cation :—
To the Right Hon. the Marquis of Salisbury, K. G.
My Lord,
I wish to address to you a pertinent inquiry. One who
knows, because he was there, tells me that at the reoent bauqu»f. at
Guildhall, you were distinctly heard to say, when the toast of Her
Majesty's health was being drunk,—" That's one oheer too many."
Suoh a disloyal remark from the professed Champion of the Consti-
tution needs no comment from, Yours threateningly,
Avenger.
The Marquis of Salisbury has replied as follows:—
Hatfield, Nov. 18.
Sir,—The incident was this. Three hearty oheers were given in
the usual way, and some unauthorised person attempted a fourth.
This gave rise to a jocose observation from myself, in which I am
unable to see anything approaohing disloyalty, and I regard your
inquiry as rather impertinent than pertinent.
Yours obediently, Salisbury.
To this the same Correspondent has replied that "he isn't at all
satisfied with the explanations given, and as soon as he can get leave
from the authorities of the establishment where he resides, he will
come and personally explain to the Marquis his reasons.''
The Seoretary of the noble Marquis has forwarded this latter com-
munication to the Governor of Cobaey Hatch, with a request that he
will exercise greater supervision in future over the epistolary vagaries
of the lunatics under his care.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [Novkmbeb 28, 1885.
THE BOOK OF BADMINTON.
A remarkable series of volumes on "Sport* and Pastimes"—vice
Strutt's, obsolete—has recently been commenced. It is intended to
be the standard English work on the subject, being written by
undeniably competent authorities, and edited by a trio whose names
alone will be a sufficient guarantee for the correctness of its general
information, and for its strict accuracy in matters of detail. The
title of this series, The Badminton Library of Sports and Pastimet,
was naturally enough suggested by the place whenoe proceeded its
first inspiration, Badminton, the home of the Mighty Hunter, His
Grace the Duke of Beaufort, E.G.
Three volumes have already appeared—the first on Hunting, the
second on Fishing, and the third on the same topic. The dedication
to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, signed" " Beaufort," and the
Prefaoe, signed by "the Editor," being repeated at the commence-
ment of each volume, on the principle, we suppose, that it is impos-
sible to have too much of a good thing. The series, as a whole, is
announced as ".Edited by His Grace the Duke of Beaufort, E.G.,
assisted by Alfred E. T. Watson," who ought to have been raised
to the rank of a Baronet for
the occasion, as from the Duke
of Bbatjfort, E.G., to plain
Alfred E. T. Watson is
rather a drop, though it would
have looked better if the name
of the untitled, but talented
assistant, had been printed as
"Alfred Watson, E. T.,"
whioh would have balanoed
the "E.G." However, Alfred
the Little prefers to be 'umble
and to " assist" His Grace.
The Hunting volume is an-
nounced as written by the
Duke of Beaufort, E.G., and
Mowbray Morris. It is en-
riched by contributions from
the Earl of Suffolk and
Berkshire, two single gentle-
men rolled into one, the Rev.
E. W. L. Da vies (glad to see
that a Sporting Parson still
remains. Is it to this Contri-
butor we owe the strictures on
his prototypes, the hunting
Abbots and sporting Bishops
of the thirteenth century r),
Diqbt CoLLTNS.and the ubiqui-
tous Alfred Watson, E. T.
Of course this volume, as one
of the series, must also have
been edited by the Duke and
his trusty henchman. The
Duke iB a deservedly popular
M.F.H., and the type of a
genuine English Sportsman.
His talented Assistant-editor
and Contributor, Alfred, is
Editor of the Sporting and
Dramatic News, and author
of Hunting Sketches, knowing
equally as muohof Sport as he does of the Drama; and being also, or
having been till recently, the Musical Critio on the Standard, a better
man for a five-barred gate (with crotchets and quavers in it) could not
well be imagined. How he would take an Oratorio in his stride, jump
in and out of a Fantasia, and follow every note of music in true work-
manlike style! With his keen dramatic and sporting eye he would tell
you whether a musical piece was well mounted or not; and, taking him
all round, we may say that, in spite of his being on the Standard, there
couldn't be a fitter man for the post. His Grace's collaborateur in this
volume on Hunting is Mowbray Morris, an Oxonian sportsman, whose
undergraduate experiences qualify him to get through what he can't
get over; he was the Dramatic Critio on the Times, is a distinguished
Quarterly Reviewer, Editor of Macmillan's, author of an excellent
compilation of poetio extracts, and the inventor of the phrase "Chicken
and champagne criticisms," whioh so annoyed some actors and
journalists.
The Drama, therefore, as we have shown, is verj well represented in
this work on Hunting, Mowbray and Alfred being Dramatio Critics,
and his Grace having been long known as a staunch patron of the
Drama, whioh, a propos of horsey subjects, maybe reckoned as one of
the Duke's Hobbies. We were, therefore, a little surprised at not
finding any mention of the Hunt as performed at Hengler's, or the
Equestrian Drama at Sanger's, nor any allusion to the history of
Duorow's, Batty's, or Astley's in the first volume, or at least, in
that ohapter of it whioh is mainly—and tail-ly—devoted to "The
Horse." It is a thousand pities that Mr. Henry Neville was not
asked to contribute, as he could recount some stirring experiences on
and off his oharger during the run of Human Nature,—a run far
longer than any recounted in this work, or any other on Hunting.
However, every distinguished contributor oouldn't have had a hand
in the series, or even in the Library of Ducal Badminton there would
not have been shelves sufficient for the books.
The Dedication is to " one of the best and keenest sportsmen of our

taking _ .
of his own" in this book?—in "knocking over driven grouse, and
partridges, and high-rocketing pheasants, in first-rate workmanlike
style," in a hard-blowing wind; in being " a good yaohtsman,"—it
does not say anything about the hard-blowing wind in this case; in
his "encouragement of raoing," and in his attendance at Cricket
Matches,—in being, in fact, "like most English Gentlemen, fond of
all manly sports." And a great compliment this from his Grace.
Then comes "The Prefaoe" signed by the Editor, E.G., presum-
ably assisted by Alfred Wat-
son, E. T. There's some
roughish ground to get over
here. For instance:—
"It is to point the way to suc-
cess to those who are ignorant of
the sciences they aspire to master,
nnd who have no friend to help
or ooach them, that these volumes
an written."
Where was the talented
friend "to help and ooach"
the Editor E.G. in the above
tance? Here's a little
easier going:—
"To those who have worked
hard to place simply and clearly
before the reader that whioh he
will find within."
The noble Editor then grace-
fully alludes to the " courtesy
of the Publisher,"—what on
earth did he do P Come down
to Badminton himself, and wait
in the hall for the "copy " P
Did he hold the Duke's stirrup,
or, when he saw His Grace
mounted, did he courteously
refrain from making any
cockneyish suggestion as to
"getting inside and pulling
down the blinds"? The
"courtesy of the publisher"
bothers us. The Editor E.G.
recognises "the unflinching,
indefatigable assistance of the
Sub-Editor,"—that is Alfred
Watson, E.T. But from what
might he have "flinched "? a
fence, a post and rails, a stone-
wall, a brook, the MS. score of
an opera, or the liquor after a hard day's hunting? But it's very nioe
and affable of His Grace, whether he is His Grace before or after
meals, and the "indefatigable" and "unflinohing " Alfred E. T.
must be highly delighted. That he will end his indefatigable and
unflinching career by being introduced to H.R.H. the Prince of
Wales, raised to a Peerage, made Lord Chamberlain, Master of the
Buokhounds, Licenser of Plays, and President of the Royal College
of Music, may be regarded as little less than a certainty.
The Duke and Mowbray Morris are responsible for the first
volume; and, of course, in a general way, so is always the Indefati-
gable and Unflinohing One. The occasional transition from " We " to
"I" gives a reality to the narrative; and the explanation as to why
the singular has been substituted for the plural comes late, but is as
naive as it is satisfactory, especially to the uninitiated reader, who is
ignorant as to which " I " of the many contributing Egos is address-
ing him. The " unflinching and indefatigable" One. no doubt had
plenty to do. The pace was too good for him now and then; and here
is evidently something that escaped the wary Alfred E.T.:—
"Now any sportsman, of average intelligence, who thinks of this, will, I
dare say, come to the conclusion that an hour after hounda have left a covert
any hounds left, if they were hunting a fox, will have rattled him out of
covert, and no longer be there,—"
And just above this, on the same page, is
THREE JOLLY BADMINTON BOTS.

classic Badminton mixture. The Indefatigable One had had a hard
day of it, he was nodding on his Pegasus, and this passed him with-
out his seeing it:—
"In the first place, it was as regard's going away that which I hare above
written as the prevailing system now."
But besides these gems in a Ducal Coronet, this first volume is full of
good things, raoy old sporting anecdotes, valuable information,
amusing remarks on Sportsmen's troubles, and some interesting
chapters on Stag and Otter hunting.
Messrs. Sturgess and J. Chaxlton have done some spirited
illustrations, and there are two or three by an Artist whose signature
is " A. B.," whioh, for "go," are equal to anything in the book;
but, oddly enough, in the picture of the huntsman leaping, there is a
signal instance of "thrusting the feet forward," which is singled
out for reprobation by the Ducal writer at page 203. His Grace,
like H. R. H., can evidently take a line of his own; not easy to
follow him here. The illustrations outside suggest good sport for the
readers, as the covers are not drawn blank. On the whole, a very
promising series. We shall next take a dip into Vol?. II. and III.,
among the Anglers. The Three Jolly Badminton Boys ought to have
begun with the Fish, and then gone to the Meets. But they haven't,
and to we take the goods the Duke & Co. provide.
ROBERT VERSUS ROBERTS.
H, well, things
is coming to a
pretty pass with
some on us,
things is. There
seems for to be
a new race of in-
quiring minds
a springing up,
as goes about a
finding out all
the most secret-
est of secrets,
and the most
delycatest of
fax, and the
most honner-
ablest of hun-
derstandings,
and then re-
weals 'em all to
a grinning and
ereverent Pub-
lio for the small
charge of a
penny! Where
its to stop I'm
sure as I don't
no, tho I don't
see as how it
can go much
furder than it
has jest gone.
How our good
and kind em-
ployer Mr. Ro-
bebts — please
notice the hex-
tra hess—could
have condysended to make such rewelayshuns on sertain dellicate
subjees, I carnt understand, I'm quite sure as his young Senior
Partner, Gentlemanly Bertram, as we calls him, would have
draw'd the line at Pigs and Waste Tubs, and suoh low things
Would he go a betraying of the perfoundist secrets of his Asiitants P
Suttenly not, for, as the Poet save, "It isn't his nature to." As
regards the question of waste of Wittels, I've nothink to say to Buoh
rubbish. It isn't in my line, and Heaves it to them as has stronger stum-
mocks, than an Hed.Waiter. Tho if they are a going to make Dainty
Dishes out of Refuse, a bio will be struck at Igh Living at which the
werry profound est Chef may well tremble.
But I now turns with a si to my own speshal greevanoes. There
appears in the Article whioh I am noticing both in sorrow and in
anger, the following liebellyous line, all in oappital letters by itself:
"Robebt Drinks the Half-bottles."
As I sed the other day, when I fust red this fowl callumny, I thort
I would go to my Loryer and bring a haction, and I went to Mr.
Eobbts near the Old Baley, who told me that he was sorry to nay as a
haction woodn't lie. I at wunce natrally said as I didn't want it to
lie, but to speak the onest truth, when he larfed and said, my good

dear Robert you are too good for this world, and he sent me away
much disapinted. But how satisfactory it is to be thoroly
aprecihatedl
Well now then, let any gent who nose what an Hed Waiter is, how
by slow degrees he rises from the wulgarrity of a mere choppouse to
the dubble refined lucksnry of a Grand Otel, let suoh a Gent try and
fanoy such a Waiter condysending to drink syruptishusly a stale harf
bottle of meer oommon Beer! Why the thing *s not only a hinsult
but a hartless one, and I feels it deeply. An ocasional glass or too of one
of my favrit brands of Champane is of ooarse quite Hotrer Showt, as
the French says, and I am pleased to hobserve as how as that Mr.
Robebts rekognises the fareness of the erangement. I for myself
cannot emadgin a more hawful torture for an Hed Waiter of refin'd
tastes and dellycate appytite, than for to be passing his hevenings
amid the most exquisitest dellyoassys that Hart or Natur can pro-
duce, and to be xpected to be oontent with meer wulgar Mutton and
Beer 1 Bbowjt, who's a bit of a Skoller, says that the life of Tan-
taylus would be nothink to it. I bleeves as he was a sort of perma-
nent Waiter who was alius a longing for what he oouldn't get, pore
fellar!
Having disposed of one matter to my own entire sattisfaoahun, I
now turns with summit of a tremble to another werry dellycate
subject. The rude and cross Questioner calls it tipping, me and Mr.
Robebts—wot a pare as regards experience, Robebt and Robebts!
—calls it ginerosity. But when my partner goes into detales he gits
jest a little mixt. For instance, he says that if a waiter serves a
dinner for 12, thorowly well, five shillings isn't too much for him.
Well I shond think not indeed, five shillings for 12 1 why its only
fippenoe a peace. Why I nose a sillybrated plaoe where we alius
looks for a shilling a head, and amost allers gits it. And why P—tho'
it was amost too bad of Mr. R. to menshun this little inf urmity of
pore human natur—but the fact is so; them as ain't ginerous is ner-
wous and wunders what we shall think of 'em, and awoides our eye
like a gilty thing as they goes skulking away with our sixpences in
their unholy pockets. But wot a perfecly orful state of things he
reweals.in the low Choppouses in the City. Fanoya reel City Cook
condescending to reoeeve a misserabel penny for pioking out a nice
Chop or Stake for the himpecuneous Sibberrite!
It seams however as the Cooks has struck and run the price hup to
tuppence. Mr. R. says this is like the happy tite increesing by wot it
feeds on. I never seed one of these remarkabel fine spessimens my-
self. Wot a werry welcome gest he wood be at the shilling Ordinary
neer Newgate I There is one house tho' as is quite after my own Art
as described by him, where ewery customer is xpected to pay 'id. to
the carver as wheels round the jints, id. to the waiter as brings the
dishes, 3d. to the hed waiter as brings the Bill, and 'id. for the table
money. That's reely sum think amost subblime, and if they has
plenty of customers, not so werry bad a plaice for a Hed Waiter to
retire to wen he's quite past work. Mr. R. winds up his rayther
free-spoken infermation by expressing the bold opinion that there
will always be what he rayther indelhcately calls tippe," until the
Millenium curaa, witch I umbly presooms is a long ways off. To
witch 1 takes the libberty of adding, and I speaks with a long and
waried experience, no, not even then, unless you so changes human
natur as to do away with grattitood, and to do away with ginerosity,
and to do away with hungry waiters and with stingy masters.

Dr. Rutherford, one of the witnesses in the Weldon case, last week,
who cautiously answered "I don't know." But would, or could Lord
Coleridge, himself, have "shut up SocratesP" We venture to
think that he oould not, even if he nad thoroughly mastered the So-
cratio method. No doubt Lord Coleridge remembers the one
striking instance of Socrates being shut up by the only person
who could shut him up thoroughly well, and that was his wife. It is
recorded in the idiomatic 'Apyo dialect which characterises the
celebrated

THE BATTLE OF THE FEOGS
AND MICE.
The strenuous toils of mimic Mars I write,
The springs of oontest and the fields of fight;
How Liberal Mioe advanocd with warlike
grace,
And battled with the croaking Tory race.
No loader shindy shook Olympus' towers,
When earth-born Titans smote the immortal
powers.
Their mighty deeds demand a mighty song,
So wake, recording Muse, and cat along I
Ranged o'er the flats that crown the reedy
shore
The embattled hosts contend, as oft before,
For right of rale supreme o'er field and marsh.
Now to the champions of the croakers harsh,
Now to the nibbling race's heroes tall,
The fight inolineth and the honours fall.
The Mioe most often, such are Jeve's decrees,
Win in the wars, and dominate with ease
Pelusia's far-reaohing flats and fens.
But-for the ways of Mioe are much like
Men's-
High confidence inspired by long success
Oft in its turn engenders carelessness,
Division prompts, indiscipline instils,
Brings croppers dire, and ends in nasty
spills.
So with the furry phalanxes arrayed
By great Psicharpax; broken and betrayed
By counsels cross and vacillating will,
In vain their valour and in vain his skill.
Great Phtsionathus, of the froggy host,
High-swollen ohief, and Frogdom'B youthful
boast,
Pert PoLYPHOircs, baotrian renowned
For boastful speech and turbulence of sound,
These, 'vantaged by wide variance 'midst
their foes,
Contrived their fall, and to their places rose.
Raged universal Mousedom at the sleight,
And roused its hosts and ranged its ranks for
fight.
Not long, they swore, the croaking race should
hold
Their stolen honours. Mekidarpax bold,
Brummagem's pride, and glory of the House,
And more a Mars in combat than a Mouse,
His actions brisk, robust his well-knit frame,
Young, but already of resounding.fame;—
This warrior, singled from the fighting crowd,
Boasts the dire honours of his arms aloud,
Then strutting near the lake with looks elate,
Threats all its nations with impending fate.
Him Polyphonous marks and loud defies,
The fire of fight in his protuberant eyes.
Well matched, these champions of the reedy
flat,
This one the nimbler, and the stouter that.
Embasichytrob, sleek and silvery chief,
Of puss-like fur, of polished speech and brief,
With tender Calaminthius oounters blows
More keen than ponderous. Calamlnihtus
knows
Chivalry's rules, and views with scornful
smile
Protagonists of the "big and bouncing" style.
The goggle-eyed Cradgasides croaks out
Defiance at Artophagcs the stout,
Bland burly ohief whose bludgeon-blows beat
down
The spiteful proddings of the Frog whose
frown,
Glassy and grim, Medusa's horror apes,
Yet wakens laughter and gives birth to
japes.
The brave Lichenor, of the impassive face,
Fronts loud Hypslboab, he who pushed from
place
Mild Calaminimus, and usurped his pott
As honoured Captain of the hopping host.
Nor these alone, but many a hundred more
Of Frogs and Mioe throng to the rushy shore,
Intent on crowning onset. Even he,
Hole-seeking Troglodytes, ever free
At flouting his Mouse-fellows, follows now
Their lifted standard with unfaltering brow.
But now the great Psicharpax shone afar,
A ventrable ohief well versed in war.
Long time the warrior in his tent abode,
Like great Achilles, silent. Now he strode
Swift to the front of battle, and upbore
The banner oft to viotory borne before.
The lesser chiefs may babble, and may boast,
He, he alone, may lead the whole Mouse-
host!
The black-furr'd hero, Miridarpai, shakes
A threatening spear, but second place he
takes
To proud Psicharpax, whose prodigious
stroke
No froggy champion ever foiled or broke.

This saw Pelobates, and from the flood
Raised with hoth hands a monstrous mass of mud;
The oloud obscene o'er all the warrior flies,
Dishonours his pale face and clouds his eyes.
Indignant, fiercely sputtering, from the shore
A stone, immense of size, the warrior bore,
A load for labouring earth, whose bulk to raise,
Asks ten degenerate Mice of lesser days;
Full on the leg descends the crushing wound,
The Frog, supportless, writhes upon the ground,
Faoe-oleared Psicharpax holds his conquering course,
And takes the headship of the furry force;
Whilst in the vanguard of the froggy bands,
Haughty, high-shouldered Physignathus stands.
Now front to front the serried armies frown.

He alludes

an eye " trained ? By running it along a line? By always keeping
the pupils under the lash, and by invariably " letting the Eyes have
it ? _ The New Comer, the Herkomer, will answer these queries
in his next lecture. He announced his intention of "painting heads
in the presence of his audience." Whose heads? The Heads of
the Colleges? This will be most amusing. And what capital fun
about Pantomime time I There will be a great rush to see the
various heads of his leoture being painted. Of course he will draw
them first with a Slade Pencil?

Interior of a Suburban Railway Carriage. Various Well-Informed

First Well-Informed Person (putting down paper). Hum—puzzling
affair, this Servian and Bulgarian business. One really scarcely
knows which Bide to take.
Second Well-Informed Person (with interest). No,—that's just it.
I '11 be hanged if one can make out what it's all about. (Tentatively.)
I suppose though the Serbs have a case against this fellow, Prince
Alexander P
Third Well-informed Person (emphatically). Not a bit of it.
That's just what they haven't got. It's all the other way about. No;
it's Xing Milan who is the aggressor. He has started the whole
business for dynastic purposes, and as for the people, they don't care
twopence-halfpenny about the quarrel.
First Well-Informed Person. That's just what strikes me. But
what are they fighting for, then?
Second Well-Informed Person. Oh, it's clear enough why they are
fighting. It's because the Conference took such a time interfering,
and let the tension get too great. They were bound, you know, to
fight if nobody intervened.
Third Well-Informed Person. No, that's not it. Who, I should
like to know, could have intervened? Not the Three Emperors : nor
France, nor Italy, nor could we. The Conference, too, didn't meet
to take cognizance of this business. Their concern was simply with
the Roumelian Question. Turkey is the proper Power to intervene,—
that is to say, if it can.
First Well-Informed Person. That's just what I think. But why
can't Turkey intervene?
Second Well-Informed Person. Surely that's obvious enough.
Why, it's afraid of Russia, of course. The Bulgarian Question is
the Russian Question. Everybody knows that.
Third Well-informed Person. No, I beg your pardon. Austria is
the Power that is most interested in what is going on at the present
moment in the Balkans. The Bulgarian Question is really the
Austrian Question. That's quite clear. Why, it is Austria that
has egged on King Milan. That's why he attacked Bulgaria.
First Well-Informed Person. Exactly. That is what I say. He
attacked it to restore the status quo ante.
Second Well-Informed Person. Just so. But why does Servia
want to restore it P That's what I can't make out.
Third Well-informed Person. Plain enough. Servia wants_ to
restore the status quo ante, because she means to go in for fighting
at any price. That's what all the row is about.
First Well-Informed Person. So I thought. But still I can't
make out why she should want to fight.
Second Well-informed Person. Well, yes. It is a very puzzling
question. I suppose, though, Salisbury knows the ins and outs of it.
Third Well-informed Person. Salisbury? No—not he—no,
nor anybody else!

THE MAN FOR THE PLACE.
Among the various questions asked in the House of
Commons—that's the place for "heckling " during the
Session—arose from time to time inquiries, put to the
late Attorney-General, as to the distinction between
'contentious" and "non-contentious business" in con-
nection with his office.
The present Attobney-General seems desirous to
undertake the "oontentious business " department; for
it Burton-on-Trent, on being rudelv interrupted at a
Conservative Meeting, Sir Richard Webster informed
the unmannerly persons that, if any one of them
would oome outside the Hall, he would aocommodate
Slim " for ten minutes. "The First Law Officer of the
Crown" is an excellent title for a gentleman so ready to
punch a nob. Dash his wig, but he is clearly the very
man for "contentious business," and knows how to take
the law, literally, into his own hands. We shouldn't like

HECKLING A HECKLER.
That a fool may ask more questions than a wise man can answer
we already know, on old, and excellent authority. But it seems
that, when the foolish questioner is himself questioned by a wiser
interrogator, he doesn't always, as the Americans say, "make much
of a show " himself.
A Conservative farmer at Shrewston, we are told, lately put Sir
Thomas Groves, the Candidate for the Wilton Division of Wilts,
through his facings with a series of questions. Well, one good turn
deserves another: so, when he had finished his catechism, up jumps
a labourer—like his newly-enfranchised impudence !—and asks to be
allowed to question the farmer. This is something like the flook
preaching to the pastor, the pews reading homilies to the pulpit.
And the labourer's questions seem to have been smashers.
The farmer had expressed an opinion that "the labourer would
be better paid if oorn were taxed." Chaplin, Lowther, & Co.,
would doubtless agree with him, and had perhaps inspired him.
But this awkwardly inquisitive labourer didn't. "Wasn't it six
shillings a week, and barley bannocks, when the corn teas taxed P"
asked ne, with almost epigrammatic audacity. Smasher No. 11
Farmer didn't come up to time with any answer, not having
Chaplin, Lowther, & Co. at hand to prompt him with some
plausible fiscal sophism, by way of counter. So that awkward
customer of a labourer pegs away again. "Can you tell of a single
measure benefiting the tenant farmer which was passed by the
Beaconsfield Government P" Come that's a wider hit, and less of
a floorer! Yet the farmer again "goes down to avoid," and
answers not. Smasher No. 21 "Hadn't the Liberals protected
them from the raids of ground game P Had they not given them
compensation for improvements, and abolished the Malt-Tax P"
To this "one-two-three" the farmer does reply. But instead of
countering his persistent foe with a spanking negative, he, we are
told, "amid much excitement, admitted this was true." Which
amounts, at most, to "taking his punishment like a man."
Smasher No. 31 The three rounds on this merry mill, Labourer
v. Farmer, went all, therefore, in favour of the former.
It is stated that" the labourer was loudly cheered," No wonder!
If this is_ the way in which the New Rural Voter sets to work,
long-despised Hodge will " make some of them sit up," before long.
Communicated.—A School-bored Boy writes, indignantly, to know
why he was plucked for an Examination, when he answered every
question right, specially this one about the Horse, which he was asked
to describe. "This is the way I did it, and showed 'em 1 knew what a
Cow was as well," says our School-bored Boy:—
"The Horse is a noble creature, and so is the Cow: he gives us milk and
has four legs, one at each corner, and a tail in the middle, and horns at the
other end; but not the Horse. If you hit him he won't do it again. He
only kicks at the back. The End."
And the School-bored Boy was plucked for this!! Too bad.
"Stock a But Baby."—See an article, with this heading, in last
week's number. Mr. Punch begs to acknowledge a number of letters
protesting against " the infant," S. Cronmire's, being considered a
member of The House." No children are admitted: and no member
of the Stock Exohange is permitted, by the rules, to advertise.
Mk. Punch has received " a Presentation Cartoon from Society."
It is drawn by Phil Mat, and certainly Mat has managed to fill the
page with some excellent likenesses, though Mr. Punch's Showman
doesn't appear "to have oome out very welL" However, "The
promise of May" has been most satisfactorily fulfilled.

THE REFORM CLUB.
AN UN-SERVICE-ABLE FRANCHISE.
The subjoined list of questions to be asked of Lodgers and Persons
claiming to vote under the " Service Clauses'' of the Reform Act., is
'or ought to be) found in the very latest "Manual for the use of
Revising Barristers " :—
1. In your present situation are you allowed a whole latch-key all
to yourself, or do you go shares with somebody else? Who may be
said to " hold the key of the situation P"
3. Does your employer invariably know you 're out, when you are
out?
3. Have you, as occupant of your room, power to wipe your feet on
the inside doormat, or merely to make use of the outside scraper?
When seeking admittance, do you give a loud and lordly rap at the
knocker, or humbly pull the area-bell P
4. Have you ever any washing, and if so, who pays for it P
5. Would you consider it within your rights, as tenant of a "top-
floor back " above your employer's business premises, to throw that
gentleman down several nights of stairs if he objected to your keep-
ing a barrel of liquid nit ro -glycerine in your apartment?
6. Are you habitually allowed one inch, or two inches, of candle
when you go to bed?
7. Is the menial who blacks your boots in your employ, or your
Landlord's P If neither, and you black your boots yourself, state
what maker's blacking you use.
8. Is the bolt of your bedroom on the inside or outside of the door P
9. Is your employer in the constant habit of putting total strangers
into your bed without asking your consent , or giving you the slightest
warning, and if so, what is your way of expressing your surprise
upon finding them there when you retire to your couch at midnight?
FREE AS AIR.
Amoks the Court announcements the other day appeared the fol-
lowing :—
"The freedom of Windsor will, it is understood, be presented to Prince
Henry by the Corporation."
The question naturally arises, in what does the "freedom" of
Windsor consist, and how will Prince Hehry be able to enjoy it?
Does it mean a gift of Windsor soap, or the presentation of a
Windsor uniform? Or does it merely imply that the Prince will
have the privilege of walking about Windsor where he likes, as a
kind of isolated " Windsor stroller"? Perhaps his " freedom" may
pass him to the State Apartments on closed days, or give him the
right of crossing over the grass? Or it may possibly involve some
relief from undue detention within the walls of the "Augusta
tower," to whioh, it appears, his Highness has been consigned during
his stay in the Royal Borough. If this is the case, it has been
certainly thoughtful of the Corporation.
Cases for Colney-Hatch.
From returns in a recently-published Blue-Book on the subject of
Lunacy, it appears that among professional men those most remark-
ably apt to go out of their mind are Civil Engineers. "The lunatic,
the lover, and the poet, Are of imagination all compact;" ana
imagination overwrought by the Civil Engineer, perhaps rendering
him " compact" with the poet, tends to set his eye likewise " in a
fine frenzy rolling." Strange perhaps to say, the statistics of insanity
supply no confirmation to the saying, " As mad as a hatter.""; ~

ESSENCE OF MIDLOTHIANISM.
Extracted from tub Diary op W. E. Gladstone, M.P.
avrn't had time to
write.my Diary
up from day to
day. Mast jot
down recollec-
tions of the fort-
night. A pleas-
ant journey up.
Made a few
speeches at the
stations, but did
it in moderation.
Made up the ave-
rage on arriving
at Edinburgh.
Last time drove
straight off to
Dalmeny. But
now got in pretty
long speech im-
mediately upon
arrival at Edin-
burgh. Rather
nervous at first.
Couldn't get
figure of Grand
Cross out of
mind. Exceed-
ingly thoughtless
of him to say
what he did at
the particular
epoch he uttered
it.
"I wonder,"
said he, "what
Mr. Gladstone
is going to say in
Midlothian, be-
cause I am ready
to answer him."
That would have
been enough to
upset altogether
a speaker less practised than myself. In mind's eye all the time I was speaking,
there was Grand Cross's spectaoled face, with his head cockt d a little on one side
like contemplative sparrow listening to every word and ready to answer it.
Shook me a bit, I own, especially at first speech. Partly got over it, with
praotice; but trust Cross won't do it again.
Wednesday, IMA.—8poke in Free Assembly Hall this afternoon. Discourse
on Disestablishment. Hall crowded partly with grim Dissenters wanting to hear
me declare for Disestablishment, partly with determined Churchmen prepared to
go over to the enemy if I did, and then Grand Caoss always at my elbow ready
to answer me, whatever I Bay. What can a man do? Necessary that I should
speak for an hour. Equally necessary that I should say nothing. Can I do
that? I '11 try Have tried, and think 1 succeeded pretty well.
Audienoe cheered all through. A little hitch once when I spoke of Church
Question not being at the door, but at the end of a long vista. Disestablishment
men growled. But if I'd said the reverse—question at doors not at the end of
a long vista—Churchmen would have growled. So it comes to the same thing.
Explained that when I said question at the end of long vista, meant it only in a
Pickwickian sense and immediately changed the subject. This seemed satis-
factory, for they cheered again, and things amicably arranged themselves.
Fancy I took the right line, walking exactly in the middle of the road, leaning
neither towards Establishment or Disestablishment.
Thursday, lUh.—Here's the papers. Let's see what they say. Fanoy
they '11 descant on the skill and dexterity with which I avoided difficulties. I
know how it will run: —" Mr. G ladstone had a most difficult task to perform at
Edinburgh yesterday. Hurried, on the one hand, into a precipitate declaration
in favour of Disestablishment; held back, on the other, by an influential party
who threaten to throw their vote into the Conservative Ballot-box if he
encourages the hopes of the Free Churchmen; the Right Hon. Gentleman steered
a middle course, happily escaping alike the Scylla of Disestablishment and the
Charybdis of the Church." That's the sort of thing, especially Scylla and
Charybdis. I have known them in all oircumstancea through more than fifty
years of newspaper reading. [Opens batch of newspapers and reads.] Halloa!
What's this? Both side9 down upon me. "Mr. Gladstone has put a heavy
strain upon the fidelity of the Liberal Party in Scotland," say the Free Church
papers. "It is all very well for Mr. Gladstone," say the Church papers, "to
declare that Disestablishment is not a question for the new Parliament. How
can he guarantee that, and what pledge does he give that the new Parliament
may not be dissolvtd in twelve months', a new Parliament summoned, and

Disestablishment carried with a rush?" [Throws doum
papers.] Pretty hard lines these. Thought I would
please everybody, and instead seem to have riled every-
body. Grand Cross will make a nice thing out of this.
Shall go out and cut down one of Rosebery's trees.
Sunday Morning, 12nd.—Here endeth the Fourth
Campaign. Spoke on Tuesday and again last night.
Enthusiastic audiences. Seem to have got over difficulty
about Disestablishment. Are quarrelling among them-
selves and leave me alone, which is pleasant. It 'a hard
work this battling with prejudices. Wonder how Salis-
bury likes it. Randolph doesn't mind. There's a
lightheartedness about that youth that enables him to
meet successive days and varying circumstances with an
entirely new manner. What he said yesterday has no
controlling influences over what he may say to-day, still
less to-morrow. But the Markiss is a serious man and
must feel the peculiar circumstances of his situation.
Wonder if he really believes he has any chance of being
kept in Office. Suppose he hardly can. Within a month
I shall be Prime Minister again, and all the old familiar
toil will weigh me down once more. How long will it
last P Well, a year at least, and then I '11 think it over
again. Sometimes not quite sure that I shall not exceed
Palmebston's record, and I'm a good many years off
that. In the meantime here's the Fourth Midlothian
Campaign over, and I am feeling as jolly as a sandboy—
though what are the precise pursuits of a sandboy, and
why they should conduce to excessive jollity of manner,
I cannot conceive. Must inquire into that. Knowledge
might be useful some day.
Now's Grand Cboss's chance. He hasn't answered me
yet, but he's been listening attentively, and I suppose
before the week's out I shall be crushed.
A FLYING VISIT.
The Cavendish Rooms. If names go for anything, this
ought to be the place for a smoking-concert—an idea we
suggest to Mr.

tations of Ir-
ving are over-

done that it
was one of the
dishes most
relished by his
patrons. He
ought to suo-
ceed with Ma-

petitors in the field; and if they are in the field at
winter-time, they will be "out in the cold," which won't
affect a Wild Brook, unless there's a tremendous frost.

of three ways: (1) by asking for it, and it being given
him as a present; (2) by adapting it to his own pocket

ROBERT DECIDES HOW TO WOTE.
I am a woter of the hindependent Burrow of Sum Panoras, who,
Brown tells me, was the inwenter of Pancakes—wenoe his name. In
that onerable capaoity I have, for the larBt three munee, been the
hobjeo of the constant atention of two of the most onerablest cents in
all our distinguished sanitary W.C. district The numbers of werry
long letters and pamphlets, and bils and edresses, has kep us all in
waste paper and innercent ermusement for the hole time, wile the
portrates and picters of the two Gents, and their goings on, has
quite deckorated wot I oalls my Studdy, tho' it's really ony my
Bed-room, ooz I does all my riting there nioe and kerreyct.
The first Gent is, I bleeve, from his welthy name, a Ebrew, and,
judgin from his Pieter, a remarkable and sum man, xcep for a werry
remarkerbel sqwint in the left eye, witch gives him the look of
always a winkin of it, wich of course in a married man with a bootif ul
wife, as I'm told as he's got, is not quite commy fo, as the f renoh says.
He seems to be a regler staggerer for Eddicasnun, wich is a pint as
don't hold mutch for me; but he cams out like a reel nobbleman as
regards the Poor, and gos in a regler buster for impruvin their
mizzerable omes, and trying to make 'em jest a little more oomfur-
abel and appy, pore fellers, Bpeshelly pore women, and, speshallest of
all, pore children! Ah, we've had plenty of tork and plenty of
premisses lately, shoals on em, oshans on em; but a pore umbel
Waiter wenturs to add jist one word of adwice, and only one—let all
jine together to better the lives of the werry Pore, or they '11 all jine
together one of these days to wusser the lives of the werry Rich.
But this buy the whey as the Milkman said.
Our second Candid Date is snmthink like a Swell 1 He sent me a
grate big Pioter with his own face in the middle a smilin away at
the world in gineral and the Burrow of Sum Pancras in pertickler,
and all round it xampels of the highly Lordable way in witch he
passes his time and spends his money. Fust you sees him a pattin
of his bootiful Raoe Orse as is a going for to win the nex Darby (may
I be there to see). Then you sees him on bis favrit unter a follerin
the ounds. Then you has him a nockin down the Fezzants with
his dubble barreld rifle. Then you oums upon him a drivin his fore
horse Drag jest like a reel Nobble'em. And then, to crown all, you
sees him in his own umbel home, most helegently furnisht, a neelin
down on the bootiful carpet, regardless of spiling it, a playing at
horses with all his lovelv childeren. The contrast between the heger
sportsman among the Fezzants, and the appy Paxient a neelin on
the bootiful carpet among his helegant orffspring, is most hartistic,
and amost drawed tears from Mrs. Robert's eyes.
'The nex thing"'as I '.ha.i from^him was a little book in which I
acshally red reel letters'from Lord Soklsbuby and Lord Iddiotsly
and that owdashus Lord Randolf, all a sayin as praps the one
thing in which they all most artily agreed was, that one of the most
important things as could be dun to save the Country was to wote
for their frend! Ah, he must ha bin a appy man, the da"y as them
flattrin letters cum, and he probberbly had another game on the
lovely oarpet with his deer hinfents jest to blow off the steam of
egsitement as it were, and then went out the nex morning andj.had a
good run with the ounds in the briling sun of Orgust.
Then I had an edress, in witch among other little matters he pro-
mist that everyboddy shood always be nice off and cumferabel if we
did but send him to Parlyment, and furder, that everyboddy as
wanted work shood alius have as mutoh as he wanted and be paid
jolly good wageB for it, and as that is just about the sort of thing as
wood suit my book, I think as I Bhall suttenly wote for my

Fragments of Agricultural Evidence.
Mrs. Temple Courteney, Dame of the Primrose League, writes in
her Diary.—Stopped the carriage on our way home to-day at Joseph
Hodge's cottage and found him in. Gave the playthings to the
ohildren and the olothing and coal-tickets to his wife, and then began
the conversation. Found him very attentive and willing to listen,
and when I described the dreadful things that would follow upon
the Disestablishment of the Church if the Radicals got into power, I
could see that what I said went straight home to him. Then I
pointed out how the dear old relations existing for centuries between
the holders of the land and those who laboured upon it would be
destroyed and disappear, and 1 am sure he was much impressed. I
finished by telling him that he might at the present moment become
a pillar to support the State, and preserve society from outrage and
overthrow by oharlatans and adventurers. He smiled, I thought,
pleasantly at this, and took it in quite intelligently, and was, to all
appearances, gratified at the importance of the role he was called on
and expeoted to fill. I could not stay very long, having several
other cottages to canvass before we reaohed home, but I know I left
him in excellent dispositions. Indeed, with confidence I may say,
we may be quite sure of counting on Joseph Hodge.
Extract from the Note-hook of Mr. John Tall-talk, Radical Agent.
—Waited about a bit and finally collared that fellow, Joseph
Hodge, in the tap-room of the "Rising Sun." Stood beer and went
at him straight. Gave him the history of the Landlords' Iniquitous
Rule from Magna Charta downwards in a nutshell. Explained the
whole coming scheme. He took to the idea of six acres and a oouple
of cows, and when I promised him a new house as well he fairly
opened his eyes. Went into the Disestablishment Question, and
showed how the whole thing was rotten to the core, and how the
Parson was mixed up with the Squire in keeping things as they were
and dead against bettering his condition, and how they were both bound
to go. Then I laid it on thick about his responsibility to the country
at the crisis, and I could see he liked the idea of his being of
importance, for he smiled pleasantly, and took a fresh pull that
pretty well emptied his mug of ale, and 1 ordered some more and
went through the points of the Birmingham catechism till I know
he must have taken them in and got them all pretty well fairly by
heart. So I may safely set down in my day's work Joseph Hodge
as " secured."

Reflections of Joseph LTodge, Farm Labourer.—Well, sure enough,

kit more aboot votin' agin them Radical chaps, as she says are

as to that, oi doan't know that there's much to be destroyed as 01
should fret over, though oi'm not to be fiummoxed wi' the big talk
of the Brummagem chap as oi meets at the tap o' the " Rising Sun."
Six acres and a couple o' cows and a foine new house for oi—that
be all well enough, Bays oi, but who's going to foind t' money for't?
"Oot o' Church property, sure enough, that'll come," says Brum-
magem chap. "Tell that to your grandmother," says oi; "ye'11
promise big enough, but when it comes to performin', you '11 sing
another tune." So, who's to have my vote? T' Squire's Lady, or
Brummagem ohsp r They were both oook-sure of it, oi could see
that much with half an eye. Faot is, Joseph Hodge, he doan't care
muoh tor t' Squire's Lady or for Brummagem chap, and he's blessed
if he thinks he '11 give his vote for either one or t'other of them.
They both be foolin oi; it would only serve 'em fair if oi be after

FAMILIAR FACES.

FILLING UP AT PHILIPPOPOLIS.
The difficulties that encountered the Porte in its endeavour to
appoint a tittintr Commissioner to represent it at Philippopolis, seem
likely to have heen overcome by the selection of Assim Pasha. As
he appears to be so noted for his taciturnity, that it is reported that,
when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, not even an Ambassador
"could get more than a nod or monosyllable from him," it may
be conjectured that he will be well suited to the post, which is one
of which it could be fairly advertised that "talking" was "no
object." Indeed, the less said now about the Servo-Bulgarian busi-
ness the better, and Assim Pasha will be entirely in his element.
The idea of appointing Rustem Pasha to the post, though momen-
tarily entertained, has been wisely dropped, it being doubtless felt
that, with suoh a name, too little of that diplomatio polish necessary
to the effectual smoothing down of the situation, might naturally
have been expected from its owner.

THE WIZARD'S CURSE.
In the days when I was young, and very foolish, goodness knows!
'Twas my painful lot to suffer from a pimple on the nose;
8o I went to a Magician, who was noted at that day
For the skill with which he oonjured such excrescences away.
He pronounoed an incantation in a dismal kind of squeak,
And assured me that my pimple would be gone within a week;
Then he caught me to his bosom, brushed away a starting tear,
And demanded twenty guineas; which I thought a tride dear.
But my pimple did not
vanish; nay;I found,
to my surprise,
That it grew until it
reached a quite un-
reasonable size.
So I called again one
morning at the Ne-
cromancer's house,
And informed him,
with a stick, that I
considered him a
"chouse."
He declared he'd have
the law of me, and
did; but what was
worse,
As I turned to quit his
premises he laid on
me a Curse,
Shouting, " Wiggles,
your brutality I '11
give you cause to rue:
Tour moustache shall
be Magenta and your
whiskers Prussian-
Blue.
"You may dye them
ev'ry day, and any
colour that you
choose,
But, whenever you
most want them to
retain their borrowed
hues,
They shall instantly revert to the gay tints that I've decreed,
Ihe effect of which, I may Bay, will be curious indeed!
"There's a glass upon the mantelpiece; go, look into it well,
Whilst 1 speak the dread and potent words that constitute my spell:
Jarnibleu! Abracadabra! flokey pokey winkey wee!
Maranathal Donnerwetter I Ego maltdico te.'"
Asi his wand he wildlyflourished,
in accordance with his rules,
I observed to my dismay that
my moustache was turning
gules,
Whilst my. whiskers twain,
which theretofore had some-
what foxy been,
Changed before my eyes to
azure—that is, bright ultra-
marine.
Panic-Btricken, as I realised the
horrors of my doom,
I entreated him to spare me;
but he bade me leave the
room.
"Take, oh, take this hitter
curse away 1 " I sobbed. He
answered, "No!
You must dree your weird as
hest you may. Good morn-
ing 1 Yon may go."
When I left the wicked Sorcerer distraction tore my mind,
And I sped away to Tkuefitt's with the swiftness of the wind.
"Say, inimitable Artist," I exclaimed, "what must I do
To get rid of this Magenta and this awful Prussian-Blue?"
"Nothing simpler," he replied, to my extravagant delight.
"Our Kallianthesistikon will promptly set yon right;


To your beard the precious liquid you must thrice a day apply.
Ten-and-six is all we charge for this inestimable dye 1"
Like a shot I paid the money, seized my bottle, and was gone;
All day long I steeped my beard in Kallianthesistikon.
The Magenta changed to yellow—grassy green became the hlue—
But at last moustache and whiskers re-assumed their normal hue.
The relief that I experienced was thrillingly intense,
And I went on dyeing lavishly, regardless of expense;
From my memory the details of the Curse kept fading fast,
And the hope that I had dodged it grew to certainty at last.
Months went on, until I lost my heart to Alexandra Brown,
Who had beauty and securities, besides a bouse in town.
As one day she smiled upon me with a tenderness divine,
In a spasm of affection I resolved to make her mine.
I was kneeling at her feet and gazing fondly on her eyes
With a comfortable feeling that I'd gained my lovely prize,
When a look of ghastly horror on her countenance appeared,
And she screamed, " Good gracious heavens! what has happened to
your beard?"
"'Tis the Wizard's Curse!" I stammered. "I am seldom taken so.
Pass it over, beauteous angel—if you love me, do not go!"
But she left me with a shudder, and 11
Breathing hideous execrations which I'
1 to my feet,
"not here repeat.
Then I wandered down her street, and as the corner I passed by,
On a hoarding near the puhlio-house a pioture caught my eye.
'Twas a bearded and moustachioed face, with whiskers all awave,
And a legend underneath, in ten-inch capitals, "Why Shave?"
"Why sot Shave?" Ah, happy thought! It flashed like lightning
through my brain,
And I started at the double off to Truefitt's once again.
There arrived, I shouted, " Hither bring your razor, strop, and hone,
Gifted Artist, shave me closely—shave me to the very bone!
"Wicked Wizard, I defy
you! Your anathema is
naught!"
(Here I yelled " Hooroosh!"
and capered like a High-
lander distraught.)
"Let my beard and whiskers
perish I You forgot to
curse my hair!"
And I laughed as I sank hack
into the operating-chair.
With a face as smooth and
hairless as a billiard-ball
or glove
I returned to Alexandra—
to my tender, startled dove.
"They are gone!" I softly
whispered. "Wilt reward
my sacrifice?
Kiss my oheek, no longer
hirsute, but extremely
sleek and nice."
Then she tearfully emhraoed me, sohhing, "Thine, for ever thine!"
And I knew that I had won her—that her scrip would soon be mine.
We were wed; and, thanks to shaving and an amply furnished purse,
For the Wizard's Malediction neither of us care a curse!

"Where are you driving to P"
The following startling advertisement appears in the Daily
Telegraph:—
IF THE CABMAN who drove a Gentleman to Kedcline Gardens, and
afterwards to Warwick Place, will CALL at before twelre •'clock
any day, he will be .REWARDED.
Most assuredly we live in a brutal age. What had the Gentleman
done that he should be driven from pillar to post in this heartless
fashion. And then some person, if possible more heartless, offers to
reward the Cabman for his conduct. Surely this person is accessory
after the fact, and he and the Cabman should be indited for con-
spiracy. Where is the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, and why does he not look into these matters P

TWO OLD FRIENDS.
A few nights ago at the Comedy Theatre I saw Erminie. It is
described in the hill as a " New Comio Opera, written hy Claxson
Bellamy" (in small type) "and Habby Paulton" (in large type),
the music being " by Edwabd Jaxobowsbi,"—whose name is printed
as big as that of the second collaborates. If size of type is a
measure of importance, evidently the person, or persons, who arranged
this bill did not entertain so high an opinion of Claxson Bellamy
as of Habby Paulton. Perhaps the Composer himself might have
observed that Claxson Bellamy was " no great shakes."
I sincerely congratulate Mr. Habby Paulton on being linked to a
collaborateur with suoh an excellent name as Claxson Bellamy,
and, at all events, it is easier to pronounce than that of his talented
musical partner in the work, Jakobowsxi. If this Composer be a
genuine Pole Star, I trust he may have many a chance of shining
brighter than he does on this occasion, when he only twinkles, and
that without any very striking brilliancy.
I do not know from what .source the conspirators ohtained their
plot, but of course their two principal characters are our old
Iriends Robert Macaire and Jacques Strop, here oalled Ravannes and
Cadeau. In the novel Robert Macaire in England, this gentle-
manly thief does, if I remember rightly; personate a Vicomte whom
he and his companions have robbed of his papers and left for dead on
the road. This was a capital starting point, and the story is well
worked out, though the subtle delicate touches of the rascally
Macaire't character are omitted, and he is represented as a mere foil
to the comic ruffian,—a foil, it may be added, without much point and
not highly polished. To those who do not know what Macaire ought
to be—a thorough Devil-Ma-oaire scoundrel, with dandified airs and
an occasional touch of sentiment, which he immediately represses,
the part as represented by Mr. Fbank Wyatt, will be sufficiently
amusing, considered as a feeder " for the oomioalities of Cadeau.

"Sure such a Pair!"
Mr. Paulton would make, as no douht he often has made, an
excellent Jacques Strop, in the real play, but the " business " indulged
in by the two thieves belongs more to a burlesque version of the
story, than to Comio Opera. The utter impossibility of these two gro-
tesque hlaokguards ever being accepted by the "nobility and gentry of
the neighbourhood " as belonging to their own order, is so glaring as at
once to destroy all notion of true Comedy, which, I believe, though
perhaps erroneously, should be the characteristic of a Comio Opera,
and relegates the pieoe to the list of Operas Bouffes, where it would
be in excellent company.
In the music there is so little to carry away, that there would be
no occasion to call for the remainder another evening but for the
song in the Second Act—all the best things are in the Second Act—
for Miss Flobence 8t. John with a refrain, "Ah me! Ah woo!"
which she gives, as she alone can give a song when it suits her, with
such vivacity and real fun as to warrant any number of encores, and
to make it the greatest attraction of the Opera. It struck me as the
best truly comic rendering of a song I had heard since Schneideb's
celebrated address to Venus in the Second Aotof La Belle Hilene, or
her " Dites-lui" in La Orande Duchesse. By the way, what the
song was about I did not exactly catch, but I fancy that the words
of the refrain were " Ah me! Ah woo 1" As to their meaning I
am still in the dark, but Miss St. John's manner of giving them is
of itself irresistibly comic. She looks charming, as she always does;
and if somewhat too nonchalant in her aoting, it may be because the
part does not suit her. But then why emphasise thisP Her old
operatic father is always going about calling her " You baggage!"
whioh must he very trying and irritating to a young lady of her
quioktemper. "Why "baggage "? If her father calls her "baggage,"
she would have a right Ito call him a hat-box or portmanteau. Miss

The Prettiest Trio in the Opera.
M. A. Victob is worthy of her name, the Viotor Unvanquished. She
and Mr. Paulton may he said to keep the fun almost entirely to
themselves. Miss Melnotte, who plays Cerise, the heroine's sister,
quietly and nicely, has shown great taste and judgment in the
mounting of the pieoe, as the scenery and costumes are unexcep-
tionable. Mr. Mebvin in powder surely ought to reduce that
enormous white moustache; hut perhaps even the persuasive
powers of the fair Manageress could not induce him to come out
as a young shaver. Miss Kate Munboe looks most fascinating,
and does her very best, in singing and aoting, with apart which, but
for her, would be reduced to a mere soubrette of the ordinary type.
Taken altogether, there is plenty of "sweetness and light" in the
entertainment to keep it going for some little time to come. The
house has been tastefully decorated, and the oomfort of the audience
thoroughly considered. We certainly do our auditoria better here
than in Paris. Quill Nibbs.
HELEN OF CAMBERWELL.
I would that very worthy maid.
Miss Helen Taylob, I could aid,
For she, deserted and betrayed,
Sits not for Camberwell!
Oh! let that craven wretch
aver,—
The base Returning Officer,—
Why he should choose 'twixt
"him" and "her"
That stands for Camberwell!
Oh! think ye not my heart was
sore,
When Helen stood outside the
door,
And did most mightily deplore
The sins of Camberwell t
I felt inclined to stab the wight
Who thus debarred her of her right,

adequate supervision over the dietetic expen-
diture of subordinates in his department P. But,
for this business, knowing it to be too much for
him, he, it seems, had requested clerkly assist-

Their suspension of their Collie seems fully
as unreasonable as the treatment awarded to

Collie had no tail to lose, nor can he fairly be
charged with having lost his head; beoause
he could not be expected to perform an excess
of brain-work, quite enough to turn his brain.
Suspend Dr. Collie! Did they really consider
their servant, Collie, a doe, that they should
do that thing to him? Well, Dr. Collie's
case is in the hands of the Medical Defence

"IMPROVEMENT" AT ETON.
We 'ye recently heard something about Reforms at Eton. The
School is divided into " Forms"—of whioh the sixth is the ohief, and
the boys of the sixth form ought always to be in the best possible
form, bat there are some forms not included in the School Division,
and these are Re-forms. Reform, by all means, whatever is bad or
unsatisfactory, but while reforming Masters and morals, rules and
regulations, think several times before you (whoever you are who
make these proposals) knock down the entire block or picturesque
buildings which inolude the Head Master's House. If this block be
destroyed then soon that other blook will be abolished—the Heads-
man's block, let us call it, at whioh so many "merry Swish'd boys"
have knelt and prayed for first fault. There have already been
protests against this contemplated destruction.
And then it has been absolutely audaciously suggested that the
Upper School should be oonverted into a Library I Shades of all
Eton Worthies, and substantial Etonians yet all-alive 01 who have
paid your half-guineas to the Head Master's servant in order that
your names should be indelibly carved on the old oak panels, whioh,
on every fourth of June, you will point out with pride to your sons
and grandsons, your wife and daughters and daughterB-in-law!
What I lose this ten-and-sixpenny immortality I Perish the thought 1
Have your names hidden by bookshelves I Never!" Arouse ye,
arouse ye, my Merry Swish'd Boys!" and protest, while there be yet
time, against all suoh unnecessary reforms as will destroy the cha-
racter of Eton; for the hands that would pull down this block of
buildings, and transform the historic Upper Sohool into a Library,
will next prooeed to demolish the Chapel, and let out the ground,
from whioh the cloisters will have disappeared, as sites for cockney
villas and additional Masters' Houses. Floreat Etona! will soon
have to be translated, May Eton be floored 1 And, if there's any
rebuilding, floored the houses will have to be. So muoh, for once,
on this subject. But there is another Improvement at Eton supposed
to have been introduced within the last ten or fifteen years, and that
is educational improvement. We should like to know if the Old
and the Oldest Boys observe any very great difference between the
work of their time, no matter how long ago, and the record of to-day,
which we put before them—the
DIARY OF A PRESENT ETONIAN.
Monday.—I take up my pen this week to make the first entry in my
Diary in a state of great indignation. I've had awful bad luck all
day. I did my Sunday Questions in time, all except the last; and so I
don't see what right my Division Master had to complain to Tutor
because I didn't happen to know my Greek Testament. And besides,
if I was late, it wasn't my fault—I can't help oversleeping myself.
I told him I hadn't been called; but he wouldn't take the exouse—
I must have tried it too often. I think I shall lose my collar-stud
next time I'm late. Besides, it was such rot my being late, because
1 meant to learn my Testament before school; but of course, as I
was late, I oouldn't; and when I tried to learn it from my Bible in
school, the beak nailed me cribbing, and set me a punishment. Then
I meant to have learnt my construing for half-past nine at break-
fast; but I got quarrelling with my minor, who messes with me, and
so I hadn't any time. I really must say that my minor is a pig;
it's impossible to keep the room tidy when he's in it, he will throw
things about so. He cheeked me, so I chucked a bit of sugar at
him. It hit him on the nose; and he sent a roll at me, so
I threw a pat of butter at him, and missed; but the butter
stuok on the wall, and made an awful greasy mark there. And if
one's minor behaves like that, how is a fellow to keep his room
straight, I should like to know? However. I managed to get
through construing, for Sckoqqles lent me his list of words, and
prompted me, and I copied his derivations when my Tutor wasn't
looking.
After elevenVolock 'school, I had to go to pupil-room and do my
verses. I got there at twenty past twelve, and my Tutor kept me in
till two. That's more than an hour and a half's continuous work,
without stopping—and that tells upon a fellow, I can tell you. At
least, it was almost without stopping, for my Tutor was ca lied away
by the Butler—on business, he said—for half an hour. I dare say
he only went to have a good feed—he's a very hungry man is my
Tutor. We had a good rag when he was away; but he came back in
the middle, and found me on the desk, shying one of his cribs at
Scbogglks, and that made him rather angry; so 1 swore I had been
working awfully hard until just before he came in; but he oouldn't
quite swallow that. However, I got nine verses done, and, with
seven that I did on Saturday, and three that Sniff did for me, and
one of ScBOGGLEs'a, and two that my Tutor gave me, it made twenty-
two; and Tutor let me off the rest when I promised that I would
learn my construing better next time. I didn't mind promising
that, as 1 shall probably find my Virgil crib by then.
One of my verses riled Tutor awfully—I can't say why. "Hanni-
baltm quatwerimus tubmittere Romam." It oonstrmes all right—
"Wehave asked Hannibal to conquer Rome"—and it scans all
right. It hasn't got a ceesura, but no more have a lot of Virgil's
lines. I told him that, and he said something about "great things
with smaller to compare," I think it was—at any rate it was poetry.
I don't quite understand him, but I rather think he was laughing
at me.
I got my allowance after dinner, and went down town at once, and
socked it; but a shilling doesn't go far, and they wouldn't tick me.
I couldn't play football after four, because I had to 'do the poena I
got for.being late. I thought I'd better do it, as I've shirked so
many; and if my Division Master gets his back set up, he '11 com-
plain of me; and the Head lays in harder than the Lower Master—
I'm told. When I had done the poena, I went in search of a crib to
learn my Virgil with; but no one had one except Sniff, and his
didn't belong to him, so he wouldn't let it out of his room. I think
I should have learnt the lesson, only we got talking about one thing
and another; and so, when the dock struck, I hadn't looked at the
crib. However, I was not put on, so I got through that all right.
Nothing happened at tea, except that my minor upset the milk—
at least, he made me upset it—he's such a olumsy beggar. At
seven we had evening sohool, which I particularly hate; and after
that, as I had no work to do for Tuesday, I played passage-foot-
ball. But it's time now for me to go to bed, and so I must shut up.
I meant to have put down how it was I came to keep a Diary, and
all about Scrogqi.es, and Sniff, and my Fagmaster; but 1 shall
have to leave that for to-morrow, I suppose.
( To be continued.)
THE REASONS OF MY NON-RETURN.
By an Unsuccessful Candidate.
Because that confounded Redistribution Bill out the majority of
my best supporters out of the constituency.
Because of a number of Unholy Coalitions between almost all the
classes, trades, and interests in the place.
Because the Local Caucus swore I should.
Because the Local Publicans swore I shouldn't.
Because the Publicans were the stronger, when it came to the pinch.
Because, though the Publicans—collectively—opposed the Caucus,
the Caucus—individually—supported the Publicans—by presence at
their bars after all its meetings.
Because a Publioan is more likely to convert a " Working Man"
Cauousite than a Working Man Cauousite is to convert a Publican.
Because the Local Caucus consisted mainly of men who voouid
spout and would not work.
Because every time they spouted they spoiled Votes.
Because so many of my volunteer Canvassers used the Canvass-
bookB for pipe-lights.
Because those who did canvass made converts for the other side.
Because the majority of the Constituency could never be induced
to come to my meetings.
Because my Caucus supporters would persist in trying to break
up the meetings of my opponent, instead of attending mine.
Because all the people who had their heads broken, and didn't
like it, voted against me.
Because I am a less confident and graceful liar than my opponent.
Because I am not an Adonis.
Because my opponent is.
Because the ladies went for him to a woman.
Because a lot of lady-canvassers enlisted in his cause.
Because female blandishments and the promise of blankets are
sometimes more potent with working-men, or at least with their
wives, than blue posters and sound principles.
Because the " pulpit drum eoolesiastic " has been pounded merrily
against me.
Because people are so easily persuaded—by property-holders,
parsons, and pretty women—that Reformer means a "blend" of
Jack Cade and Toic Paine.
Because Chamberlain has horribly frightened and aroused to
combined action all the property-holders, parsons, and pretty women.
Because the members of this Triple Control identify me with the
cause of " Joe," and consequently " go for me " with uncompromising
unanimity.
Because—in their local organ and otherwise—they paint me as a
pleasant combination of liar,thief, bigamist, born idiot, artful dodger,
poor adventurer, wealthy monopolist, dandy, demagogue, slave,
despot, party-haok, renegade, atheist, skittle-sharper, dynamiter
and duffer.
Because Cobbler Bob, the blatant local Bradlaughite, supported me.
Last—and, of course, least—because the majority of the Consti-
tuency made up their minds to have nothing whatever to do with
me I

A DISCLAIMER.
With a view to silencing any further misrepresentation, Mr. Chamberlain has
most emphatically protested that he has not promised Three Acres and a Cow to every
Rural Voter. Judging from the way in which Party compliments are flying, he might
add to the list. Though his supporters will not need to be assured on the subject, his
opponents may yet need reminding that he has not at present counselled the following
measures, viz.:—
That the furniture and effects of Country Gentlemen he equally divided among the loeal
Agricultural Labourers; That the Archbishops and Bishops of the Church of England, as soon
as it be disestablished, be shipped off to New Zealand; That St. Paul's be let out for Sunday
afternoon Atheistical Lectures, illustrated.with Dissolving Views; That Westminster Abbey
and Canterbury Cathedral be opened as popular Music Halls; And that the confiscated
emoluments of the Church be applied to the furtherance of the National Industries, notably
to subsidising the Screw Trade.
POLITICAL KISSES.

inseparable from the progress of an Election

influence upon the result of it. The kiss political
is, ia fact, a time-honoured institution."—St.

In other days the Candidate,
As old Election tales relate,
Of our staid English nation,
Kissed all the women; babies too
Got many a " buss," as was their due;
Folks won by osculation.
But now we've come to colder times,
And ne'er can our Election rhymes
Recount such pleasant stories:
The kissing of the days pone by
Is o'er, like wine and bribery,
And old Eleotion glories.
No more fine ladies give a kiss,
To help a husband up to this
The height of his ambition,
To represent a town or shire;
'Iwould set committee-rooms on fire,
Such aid to requisition.
And yet when ladies vow that they
Should go to Parliament to-day.
Most useful they would find it;
Who could refuse to give a vote,
When asked for in a dulcet note,
And with a kiss behind it.
That women are advanced, no doubt
Exists, but Punch would fain point out
To these ambitious Misses,—
They'd find the path to Parliament
Much easier, if time were spent
In bribing men with kisses 1

ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.

uanre yesterday forenoon in Buckingham
Palace, specially lent by Her Majesty
for the purpose, Tobt, late M.P., was
nominated as Candidate for the repre-
sentation of the County of Barks. He
was proposed by John Bull, Esq., of
Great Britain, India, Australasia,
Canada, and toe Isle of Man. The
nomination was seconded by Mr. Punch,
of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America.
The Lord Chancellor, who presided,
asked whether there was any other
Candidate. Mr. Punch (totto voce
"I should think not." Usher:
[so-called because he is always making
a noise) "Silence!" There being no
further remark, Toby, onoe more M.P.,
was deolared duly elected. An immense
crowd had assembled round Bucking-
ham Palace, and the new Member, his
Proposer and Seconder, were received with loud and continued cheering.
Toby, M.P., the newly elected Member for Barks, was born in the spring of
1841, of poor but honest parents. He was not the only member of the family,
which was, indeed, inconveniently large. It would be idle to deny the fact that
at this time the subject of our memoir suffered much privation, though it was a
life of luxury compared with an epoch shortly to follow. One day his father told
him that he must "look after himself." Toby, always obedient, immediately
began to do so. He turned round and round in the effort till he was almost dizzy,
and then he had caught only a fleeting glimpse of the end of his tail. On stop-
ping through pure exhaustion he found lis lather had fled.
He was alone in the world 1
What was more, he was hungry. If there was anywhere a dog with sixpence in
his pocket determined some day to manage a theatre, that dog was not Toby.
He thought first of breaking a window, and so getting sent to prison. He stood
before a butcher's shop, and thought he would steal. But he was too honest.
Besides, the meat was hanging far above his reach. As he stood marvelling what
he should do or whither he should go, he observed a portly Gentleman walking
down the street with a stick and a benevolent smile. The wild thought
entered Toby's head that he would bite him. The stranger's legs were a little
slim in comparison with his figure. "But," as Toby cheerfully said to himself,
"beggars mustn't be choosers." The mere thought of getting something
between his teeth made his month water.
The stranger came along humming a tune, beaming with good-nature, and
swinging his stick. Toby hesitated a moment. What had the stranger done to
him i There might be for him at home a fond wife awaiting his presence, a
cluster of happy children to lisp his name. Why should Toby send him into
their presence with a mangled calf P
"Sentiment be blowed!" said Toby to himself. "I mutt bite something
—so here goes."
He made a dash forward, and what he did bite was—the dust.
"Ha! ha! would you P cried the Benevolent Gentleman, his smile suddenly
changing into a stern frown whilst he brought the stick down on Toby's sconce.
Tobt was at this time a mere ohild, a ciroutnstanoe difficult to realise by those
now accustomed to listen to the words of wit and wisdom which fall from his lips.
He lay yelping on the ground. Gradually the stern look faded from the face of
the Benevolent Gentleman, and there beamed onoe more the smile.
"Poor dog!" he said—" methinks I have wounded thee. Accompany me to
my home, and no more of your larks."
Toby limped along at the heels of the Btranger, who led
him home, inducted him to the kitchen, and placed food
before him. Toby, M.P., has been heard to say in more
prosperous times, when dining with Marquises, Dukes,
and a' that, that he never forgets the flavour of that
sausage, nor the remorse which haunted him for weeks
afterwards at the thought that he had snapped it up in
two bites, when he might have lingered through six.
In 1841, lo! a strange thing happened. The Benevo-
lent Gentleman (who was none other than Mr. Punch)
started a weekly show, and invited Toby, not then M.P.,
to join him in the undertaking. Later on he said—
"Come, we will change our course of life. I will
sit in a chair with a pen in one hand, and the forefinger
of the other at my well-developed nose. You shall sit on
a pile of many volumes, with a frill round your neok, and a
feather in your hat, whilst the merry world goes round."
Toby accepted the offer, and there they sit to this day.
In 1881 Toby was elected M.P. for Barks, after a severe
struggle, in which he oame out triumphantly, at the
head of the poll. As appears from the above announce-
ment, the Hon. Member has now been returned without
a contest.

PROFESSORS OF POETRY.
Dbas Professor Punch,
In writing concerning the Professorship of Poetry
at Oxford, the Daily News asks, " How should a Pro-
fessor of Poetry lecture P" How t Why, he shouldn't
lecture at all. He should sing. On a fine day, when it
happened to suit him, he should loll in a well-cushioned
punt, beneath some leaf-shaded spot on the Thames or the
Cher well, with a silver tankard of something-and-ioe, and
plenty of cigarettes handy. And then he should sing
whatever he might have to say, accompanying himself
on the banjo. Now, I would ask, can Mr. Francis
Turner Palorave, M.A., of Exeter College, sing and
play the banjo f If not, why is he appointed Professor
of Poetry * to the University of Oxford. I only wish I
had been up in time, and then I would have had the ap-
pointment myself. I would have shown them how to

A MUGWUMP'S APPEAL.
Dear Mr. Punch,
Taking up my Daily News the other day I dropped npon a
little poem oalled the " Ballade of the Mugwump." Now I adore
Ballades, and I dote on quaintness. Mugwump sounds quaint. So
expecting that superior treat whioh springs from the tender titillation
of the subtler aesthetic susceptibilities, I re-arranged myself in my
easy chair, pointed my polychromatic pantoufles towards the pleasant
blaze and proceeded to perusal of this queerly named poem.
Sir, I was disappointed, I may say disgusted. The " Mugwump"
from whioh I had expected so much, thinking it must be something
Villon-oxxa or Baudelaire-ieh, tarns out to be, in Amerioan political
parlance, the superior person who holds aloof from polities. The
refrain of the Ballade, intended, I presume, to be satirical, is, "The
Mugwump does not vote." The Mugwump is pictured as a con-
temptible being, who disoovers a seifiah satisfaction in standing
aside from the press of praotical politics.
Bat, Sir, lam a Mugwump, if that is what a Mugwump means.
I never vote. Good gracious, no! The very thought of turning out
on suoh a morning as this to plod down to the polling booth and affix
my oross to a sorap of paper in a dreary place smelling potently of
fustian and fresh out planks makes me shudder. I hate politics.
They are so troublesome, so noisy, so uncomfortably warm. They
involve horrors oalled Public Meetings. What is a public meeting?
A distressingly orowded mass of perspiring humanity where the few
talk loud nonsense, and the many make horrid noises to show their
appreciation of it. They whirl their arms about and shout
"Hooray I" To see a grown man shouting "Hooray!" is, to me,
an amazing sight. Only euy-boys and fools at a boat-race should
shout "Hooray I" i" could not do it to save my life. And as to
dapping one's hands—as all the listening idiots do at every other
stupid sentence of the painfully emphatio speaker—why it absolutely
hurts!
To me the country appears to be comfortable enough, without all
this troublesome fuss about Reform. If any agricultural labourer
is so singularly constituted as to be happier with a vote, he is quite
weloome to mine, I am sure. J do not want three aores and a cow—
what could I do with them? And as to Disestablishment, so long
as they do not disestablish Clubs, I do not oare. I rather fanoy,
from what excited friends tell me, that that singularly loquaoious,
and distressingly earnest person called Gladstone is disposed to be
down upon them as haunts of idleness and luxury, forsooth I Well,
if Reform means the abolition of idleness and luxury, Reformers
must be madder even than I have taken them to be. What else
is worth living for P
Besides, I do not care for any Party. I dislike the Radicals be-
cause they are so dreadfully destitute of repose, and wear such shock-
ing bad hats, whilst, as to the Primrose Leaguers, well / should say,
some way after Peter Belt:—
A Primrose loved by old Earl B.
A yellow Primrose is to me,
And it is nothing more!
To the numerous " Dames" of my acquaintance it appears to be a
sort of sacred oriflamme. They pester me worse than a lot of im-
portunate widows, and if they don't bring some of their pet Candi-
dates to grief before they've done, the Corrupt Praotiees Aot is a
farce and a fraud.
I declare I have written quite a long letter, and am almost falling
into the unpardonable sin of "emphasis." Well the Parties may do
what they like with the country so long as they do not disturb me.
That I hold to be philosophy and good form. And beoanse I do so I
am to be held np to the ridioule of angry Philistines as
A Mugwump!

Visitor, "How ia it, I wondeb, that you always out better Tjsa at

THEEBAW'S DIARY.
Monday,—Glad it's all over. Cost me a pane giving up Mandalay and the
entire army, especially as I had settled a grand military execution for next
week. This invasion has put out all my arrangements. The Cabinet Torture I
had fixed for the 15th postponed indefinitely. These Barbarians don't know how
to govern. Why, they have been in the capital for the last four-and-twenty hours
and haven't yet killed anybody—not even impaled a Prime Minister I
Tuesday.—They are beginning to understand me and my little ways. A dish of
live snakes at breakfast this morning, capital I Had an interview with the Chief
Barbarian. He was very civil, but refused to scald my late Privy Council to death
in boiling oil! When asked if I wanted anything else, sulked, and said "No."
Suddenly remembered that my European tailor just before I left Mandalay had
sent in his account. Requested that his head might be removed and forwarded to
me by Parcels Post. Chief Barbarian said he was afraid that the regulations
would not allow of the transfer, but he would " see what could be done." Told
him that I did not want to cause inconvenience to anyone, and that if they buried
the tailor alive it would do just as well.
Wednesday.—Very dull indeed. Nothing to do. Asked the Chief Barbarian
if I might have a dozen or so of my cousins to slay. Told me that " Murder was
prohibited." Couldn't see what that had to do with it. Surely the head of a family
may thin it occasionally? Was extremely annoyed because the Chief Barbarian
refused to allow the steamer that brought me from Mandalay to be blown up, with
its crew, for my amusement. The Chief Barbarian takes advantage of my weak-
ness. He is a bully I
Thursday.—Chief Barbarian tells me that deputation from the Burmese Branch
of the Anti-National League and Destruction of British Interests Association desired
to see me. When they were admitted they told me that they would use their best
endeavours to get me restored to the throne of my ancestors. Very good of them,
but they bored me. Before retiring they thanked me for the patience with which
I;had listened to them. They wouldn't have had the opportunity if I only had
had my nine-bladed sword ready to hand before they entered! Subsequently
the Chief Barbarian refused to have them all bitten to death by serpents, although
I begged him to give the order as a personal ^favour to myself. The Chief Bar-
barian is very unkind to me!
Friday.—Received a number of letters from British sympathisers, oondoling
with me on my dethronement. Answered them on my pet'' poisoned note-paper."
The only real bit of en'oymentl have had since leaving Mandalay. How surprised
their exeoutors will be !' Saw Pbendergast chuckling in
a corner. What at? Something he was reading, he
said. What? I asked. Then he told me it was the cur-
rent number of Punch. I informed him that I knew of
Mr. Punch perfectly well, and I said that I wished the
people of England to be told how deeply I regretted not
having studied the wise words of Mr. Punch all my life,
and then I should not now be in my present pickle.
Prenderqast replied that he would write the Queen to
that effect, and then continued reading and chuckling.
Should like to take his head off. I hear that Mr. Punch s
Artists take off people's heads; even the heads of the
greatest Ministers. I love Mr. Punch's Artists for this.
There is a sympathy between us. We Bhall meet.
Saturday.—I am to be liberated, and go to England.
I am to have a benefit at a place called Madame Tussaud's
where (with a double-headed war-club) I am to run a-
muck for five minutes amongst the Early Norman Kings.
I am to be lodged at the Albert Palace, because it is more
lively than Buckingham Palace. Also I shall meet
Mr. Punch's Artists, who take off people's heads.

To Town, about the close of dull November,
Up comes the Country Cousin, pray remember,—
The Cattle Show to visit in December!
She's bonny and bewitching in her sealskin,
Her pretty gloves fit tight as any eel-skin,
And roses bloom—not rouge—upon her real skin!
Her winsome, watchet eyes, they are the sweetest
Her hotlines and her ankles are the neatest,
Her toilette you '11 consider the completest.
She's pretty, piquante, pouting, and capricious;
Sd dainty, dimpled, daring, and delicious:
She's joyful, and she's jaunty and j udicious.
She loves to hear the latest tittle-tattle;
On manners, music, crinoline, and cattle,
And pictures, peers and poets will she prattle!
She often goes out shopping with her Mother,
The Park she sometimes visits with her Brother—
She'd muoh prefer to stroll there with Another!
The bright Mikado musio sets her humming—
And how she likes the Temple kettle-drumming,
With those who love to go chrysanthemumming I
She has no views on " rights" or vivisection,
Finds politics a bore, upon reflection—
But dotes on Cornet Grain and his Election!
She dearly loves a pleasant lunch chez Veerey,
And much prefers dry Pommery to sherry;
She's " gone " on Mr. Ibvtnq and Miss Terry 1

She can't e'en rest 'twixt Saturday and Monday,
But in a hansom—despite Mrs. Gbundy—
She drives down to the Abbey on a Sunday!
She's bright each morn—as fresh as any daisy—
And when with seeing sights I'm nearly crazy,
She says lam" incorrigibly lazy 1"
But when one day from Euston she has started,
(Those eyelids drooped a wee bit when we parted!)
I certainly felt dismal and down-hearted.
That merry whirling time at last is ended!—
And as for hearts? Pooh I pooh! I'm feeling splendid!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[December 12, 1885.
FURY AND JURY AT CAMBRIDGE.
The premiere of the Eumenides (by Messrs Vebball and .JSiCHr-
lus), was one of the most carious spectacles ever placed before a
nineteenth-century audience. The originality of the plot is unques-
tioned, except by the pedants who object that it is partially adapted
from the Greek of Lkmpriere. The First Aot opens on the Terrace
before the Temple (an unassuming edifice) of Apollo, at Delphi.
The Prophetess comes on alone, and obliges us with a brief prScts of
local history. She then goes off to enter the Temple, but comes back in
freat dismay, remarking that she has "had ««cA a turn." In the
emple she has discovered a number of women, sound asleep (though
no Select Preacher is in the University pulpit), and, as sne rather
coarsely puts it, "their snoring nostrils blew fearsome rheum." She
says she left the Temple on all fours, but she does not "come on" in
that original fashion. She appeals to Apollo, who (like John Wel-
lington Welti) is " master of spells " to " expel" them. Apparently
a pun is intended.
Then the curtain rose on the interior of the Temple. Orestes, an
interesting orphan, who has just killed his mother for killing his
father {Agamemnon), is sitting at the base of the sacred stone, sup-
posed by the authors " to represent the centre of the earth." Orettet
is not, as one might have expected, in mourning. Behind him is
Apollo, as handsome a god as you oould wish to see, and Hermes,
who having no words to speak, is naturally sulky. About a dozen
elderly ladies in gauze veils appear to have escaped from come Con-
tinental pension, and are asleep in various odd attitudes all over the
stage. These are Furies. They have come to_ oatoh Orestes. He
has killed a relation (a mother, in fact), and it is the peculiar busi-
ness of the Furies to punish people who kill their relations. There
is no one else to do it. because what is everybody's business, in the
family circle, is nobody's business. Apollo directs Orestes to run
away to Delphi, and the hero jumps off with a lead, whioh he
gradually increases, the Furies being left snoring at their post.
Then, in a mist of violet smoke arises the ghost of Orestes' mother,
Clytaemnestra. It is not " Mrs. Rawdon Crawley," (as in another
version of the piece in Vanity Fair) but Mr. Platts, of Trinity.
Clytaemnestra, nnder the disoomforts of a ghostly existence, has
"gone off " dreadfully, in her looks, since her appearance in Balliol
Hall, some four years ago, when Mr. Frank Benson took the part.
She wakens the Furies, (who snore quite audibly) and they leap to
their feet, a fearsome spectaole, gauze veils, snakes, and all complete.
It is impossible to over-praise the Furien, who are the life and soul of
the piece. As there is not much room for them on the stage, the less
eminent Furies chiefly shake their fists from platforms which take
the place of stage-boxes. Their singing is excellent, better than
their argument, which is that murder " does not count," unless the
slain person is, like Clytaemnestra, a relation of the murderer's.
Now a man's wife is not a relation (unless he marries his cousin) so
when Clytnemnestra killed her husband, it did not matter much.
"When I killed Aim, it was nothing," is the position of Clytttm-
nestra, backed by the Furies; "but when you kill me, it's
murder 1"
We now had a wait of twenty-five minutes, and then the curtain
rose on the Temple of Athene, in Athens. The statue of the goddess,
with a broad grin on her good-humoured features, was reckoned
very arohaio. Orestes entered, and prayed, and then the Furies
were at him. Here a passage was adapted from "Jack the Oiant
Killer "—" Fee fa, fo fum,—I smell the blood of an Englishman!"
says the Giant in that old favourite. "Now somewhere hereabouts
he ii lurking, for a pleasant savour of human blood doth salute me,"
our Authors make the Furies cry aloud.
After " a long song and a strong" from the Furies, Athene comes
in, a very tall and fair goddess, in a brass helmet. She hears the case,
and goes off to summon a Special Jury. In the last Act the Jury,
exceedingly old undergraduates, with a Roman soldier in a brass
helmet, come on the scene. The Furies, as counsel for the prosecu-
tion, frequently deserve to be committed for contempt of Court.
They open the oase noisily, and cross-examine the prisoner at the
Bar. He admits the murder, but oalls Apollo as a witness to
oharaoter, and to " the very best motives." Apollo not only speaks
to character, but denies the jurisdiction of the Furies. They oan
only punish a man who has killed a relation. Now, Apollo argues,
a man's mother is no relation to him at all. The Furies ridicule
this plea, when Apollo brings off a great coup de thSatre—
"Here is a witness," he says, pointing to Athene, "who never had
any mother at all, but was born out of the head of her father. There-
fore a man's mother is a mere accident, and Clytamnestra was no
relation of the accused!"
Athene then sums up, charging in favour of Orestes, and the
Jury vote by ballot. She adds her white ball, and the lots being
equal, Orestes leaves the Court without a stain on his character.
The rest of the piece consists of a series of songs, in which the Jury
persuade the Furies to stop, in a friendly way, at Athens, and they are
conducted to their rooms by a toroh-lit procession.
While the Authors oan hardly be congratulated on their plot, or on
the character of their law, and their ideas generally, the Actors, one
and all, were warmly and deservedly applauded. They spoke Greek
"with an English accent," (as Mr. Howklls complains that we all
speak English) but thev spoke it very distinctly. The comic aspect
of the Furies was redeemed by their excellent singing, and Dr.
Stanford's musio was rather more than worthy of the occasion.
Perhaps, next time, a little more common sense and allowance for
modern feeling in the play itself may be recommended to ^Eschtxtjs
and his very clever collaborator, Mr. Ykhh.u.l.

Great Battles of the Army, and of the Navy, too,
Both written by Lieutenant Low—you're bound to read them

Of pleasant books for babyland you '11 find there is no laok,

"IMPROVEMENT" AT ETON.
DIARY OF A PRESENT ETONIAN.
Tuesday.—This has indeed been an eventful day. AH sorts of
things have happened, and one sort of thing that I particularly dis-
like, in faot I can hardly sit down, it hurts so. But before I write
down how that happened, I must say how it was I came to keep a
Diary—1 don't always show my work up—in time, you know, and
occasionally I am late for Bohool: and so Tutor, who very often jumps
to conclusions, I think, says that I'm irregular, and ought to do
something to make myself punctual: so he suggested that I should
keep a Diary—I said I would if he liked, but 1 wasn't going to do it
for nothing. He took the hint, and promised that if I kept my Diary
to the end of the half, he'd give me a prize, and as there's only about
a month more 1 can do that, of course. I should rather like to have
a prize, because I haven't had one since my first half, when I sapped.
The governor out up rather rough last holidays because I didn't get a
good report: so if I bring him a prize and tell him it's for good
conduct, he '11 be awfully pleased. He need never know. And be-
sides, I'm sure it's conduct to keep a Diary.
Scroggles is my best friend, but he doesn't board in this house, I
am sorry to say—Scroggles's pater is an M.F.H., and I believe he's
an M.P. also, but of course there aren't as many M.P.'s as Masters of
Fox-Hounds. Scroggles is awfully fond of hunting and sport, and
so am I: and when we get to talking horse, we generally go on for a
long time. Scroggles is rather clever, too, and helps me with my
work sometimes: but as he doesn't board here, I can't always get
it from him, and then I go to Smiff, who isn't a bad sort of a snipe.
As for my Fag Master Mottle, he's an awful rummy sort of fellow.
He doesn't seem to care muoh for games, and doesn't even play for the
honse: hut draws and reads poetry, and Dickens, and all that sort
of thing, when other fellows are watching a match, and altogether 1
can't make much of him. He hasn't got any colours yet, and I
don't think he will, especially as he is leaving this half, so he'll
probably go as colourless as he came. As everybody hasn't seen
Mottle, I'd. better explain that he's got a very pale complexion
He's got a friend called Coward, who plays the piano very well4
which isn't such a bad sort of thing to do, only he will play such
rotten stuff—olassical musio: just as if we hadn't enough classics in
school, without having Greek or Latin musio out of school. And he
plays an awful tune called "Low and Oreen."* I believe it's a
German oomio song, though it's not very funny. However, when he
begins it, the fellows generally bag his musio, and make him play
the "Mikado" whioh is miles better.
We had Geography at early school, and Xenophon at nine: I got
through them ail right. At 11*15 our awful two hours' school began,
our division had drawing the first hour, and mathematics the second.
I draw rather well, I think, and have some idea of illustrating my
Diary, like Dick Dotls. Dick Doyle wasn't at Eton I should say,
but don't know. I saw a copy of his Diary in my Tutor's study.
He must have been an awf ol sap. It wasn't bad up to mathematics.
We had a good lower-boy game after four: I was Captain of one
side and got a goal.t But I can't give an account of the game, much
as I should like to, for everything is " o'ershadowed" (as we say when
we do verses) by the event from the effects of which I still smart.
Smiff bought a couple of squirts to-day, and we agreed to have a
fight after tea on the top-passage. So, soon after six we took off our
coats, and swathed ourselves in towels, and it was agreed that I
should hide and Smiff come and look for me. Just as I was wonder
• Our Etonian probably means "Lbhenprin." If he doesn't, we don't
■ee what he can mean. Evidently education at Eton is considerably im-
proved.—Ed. t Our Etonian is alluding to football.—Ed.
ing where to go I noticed that the trap-door in the roof was open, and
rot some fellows to help me up and give me a tumbler of water,
tore long, Smiff came up looking for me, and just as he got near
I let drive: but he caught sight of me and ducked, so all the water
went on the floor.
Well, all the fellows were laughing, and Smiff and I were going to
set to, when up oomes the Captain of the house with his cane, and
seeing Smiff wrapped up in towels, with a squirt, and the water on
the floor, guessed what was up. He must have caught sight of me,
for he yelied out to " you fellow up there" to come down. I didn't
intend to answer him, so I crept away, and I think I should have got
off, only I tripped over some wires, and set every bell in the house
ringing, and what was worse, I put my foot through the ceiling: and
after that I didn't think it was muoh good trying to pretend I wasn't
there, so I came down, and a jolly ass I looked all bandaged up with
towels, and my face covered with dust.
The Captain told me to take that foolery off, and sent me to my
room: and shortly afterwards he had an interview with me. He
brought his oane with him.* It rather quieted me, and I began to
prepare my French for to-morrow, and I daresay I should have
finished it, only Smiff, who had also seen the Captain and his cane,
came in to talk. It is after prayers, and I am writing my Diary,
and I hear the boy's-maid coming to take my candle. In she comes.
Oh, I say, leave it a minute. No. Out goes the oandle. Blow it 1
I must go to bed now and get up early to-morrow, I suppose.
* Is this among the Eton improvements? A Captain of a house chastising
with a cane may, or may not, be an improvement. But it is certainly a
novelty. Cave cancm !—Ed.
(To be continued.)
A PLEA FOR THE PILOTS.
It does not need any knowledge of a seafaring life to understand
how arduous and important are the duties of the Pilots of the United
Kingdom. And most people know also—and if they don't, Admiral
Punch begs hereby to inform them—that those duties are performed
cheerfully and courageously, in all weathers, for what is certainly
not magnificent pay. It seems, then, that the Pilots have grievances
of various kinds, and hence the United Kingdom Pilots' Association
has issued a modest address, asking Electors to impress upon Candi-
dates the need of an inquiry into Pilotage, and the laws affecting it,
before a Royal Commission, with, it is to be hoped, remedial legisla-
tion afterwards. In the Merchant Shipping Act of last year a cruel
attempt was made to abolish compulsory pilotage, without a penny
of compensation to the Pilots, while the direct oonseqnence would
have been infinite danger to life and property at sea. It is feared
that this clause, which ia a favourite " fad" of the Board of Trade's,
may appear again is some other Bill: and even now the Swansea
Harbour Trustees are trying to obtain powers to do away with com-
pulsory pilotage as regards that port. There are other grievances
whioh need not be detailed; but Admiral Punch trusts he has said
enongh to back up the petition of his good friends the Pilots, and
o commend their views to the best attention of a Parliamentary
Committee.
How to Bo It.
If "you want to earn some siller,
Sit and write a Shilling Thriller I
Introduce a Becret killer.
And a strange eccentrio Will— er,
Pretty girl, a true heart-filler,
Brawny beau, a regular " miller."
Hunt the lot from post to pillar.
Paint things getting ill and iller,
Midnight black than Hades stiller!
Sea! A boat without a tiller!
Stab! Plunge I Rescue I Artful
"billerf"
Bookstalls! Bobs! And there's
your Thriller!
"Not on All Fours."—Was it" Truthful James " who suggested
that Mr. Chamberlain should be known as "Bob Acres t" But
where does "the cow " come in, unless it is understood in the signi-
fication that Bob Acres was a oow-herd t This won't do: the Radical
leader has the courage of his opinions; he isn't at all Bob Acres, and
he won't be cowed.
Almost Alone.—If the Grand Old Ex-Prime Minister should
have to form an Administration, he will find himself almost in the
position of the Last Rose of Summer, as, in consequence of .their
rejeotion by their Constituencies, so many of his " blooming com-
panions are faded and gone." No matter! More where they came
from.
Will it still be "Gosset's Room, in the House of Commons!
Long ago it might have been called Gossips' Room," and over the
portal should have been inscribed "All politios abandon, ye who entei
here 1"

these yellow sands—I would they were not yellow, for 'tis not a
colour I admire—I walk securely. But where is Giles? I do
not Bee him. Perchance he is still in the fields. He cannot surely
have forgotten that he has to meet me on the shore, and show me the
nearest way to Premier Point. (Looks round.) No sign of him as
yet. i How the waves roar! I wish he would come! The gulls, too,
are screeching so, one can hardly hear oneself speak. Fancy 1 What
is life if you can't hear yourself speak, or make others hear you P
How thankful I am that I carry this seat (showing camp-stool

have so strong a support as this seat affords. Here pan I ait and
watch the waters, till he comes. How far is it to Point Premier?

out " Disestablishment!" And hark again. "Fair Trade 1" "De-

they not be bitter enemies hereafter? Poor Joe! So impulsive!
So headstrong. Ah! he would have run away with me, but
I dared not consent. Run away P To where P He would have
gone too far, and I should never have been able to return. Ah,
me! (sadly) it is better as it is. At our last interview he quitted
me in an angry mood, because he thought I spoke unkindly to him.
Yet what was I do P For the'sake of those I love, for my own good
name, I was bound to speak out plainly, and tell him he wai too bold,
too daring, too venturesome. Had I yielded to him, could we have
ever got on well together P Impossible! When I look baok to the
time I had with him in Egypt, how headstrong he was, how
obstinate! (During the above soliloquy while she has been lost in
meditation the stage darkens, ominous gusts of wind are heard, the
waves gradually increase). What do I see! The sea is rising

kerchief frantically above her head. The water has now risen nearly to
her shoulders.) Help! Help! If only Giles could see me
Ah! . . . . (Sinks, oattling with the waves. At the same instant
Giles appears on the County shore. He carries a leaping-pole.)

GLADSTONIUS.
(Extract from a Classic Poem.)

But with a crash like thunder,
Fell many a loosened "plank,"
And, with a dam,* the Grand Old
Man
Made for the County Bank.
• • # •
"0 Voter, Rural Voter,
To whom we Liberals pray,
A Liberal's life and policy
Take thou in charge this
day!"
So he spake, and speaking, fas-
tened
The well-worn mackintosh,
And, with Welsh flannel on his
back,
Plunged Hodgewards in the
slosh.
• * • *
And when above the turmuts
They see his drooping gills;
From the Reform came loud
applause,
And the Times' Leader-writers
pause
To trim their well worn quills.
» * » •
But his limbs were borneup bravely
By the brave heart within,
And the Good Rural Voter
Bore bravely up his chin.
• » • •
And now he feels the bottom,
Now on dry earth he stands,
Now round him throng the
Lib'rals,
To press his muddv hands.
• • * •
They gave him an umbrella-stand
In record of the fight,
And twelve stout Btand-up collars
To wear from morn till night.
They gave him gay gardenias
For buttonholes, 1 vow,
And Chamberlainus promised
him
"Three Acres and a Cowl"
• There is something like this in Macaulay's Lays :—
"And, like a dam, the mighty wreck," &c.
The Two Obadiahs.
Mr. Isaac Holden, in his seventy-eighth year, has won a splendid
victory for the Liberals in Yorkshire. His son, Mr. A. Holden, hat-
won a seat in Bradford. It is pleasant to think that, in this par-
ticular case, the difficulty anticipated in distinguishing Members by
the nomenclature of their Constituencies will not exist. The Members
for the Keighley Division of the West Riding of Yorkshire and for
the Eastern Division of Bradford will, of course, be known respec-
tively as the 'Olden and the Young 'un.
That Cow Again!
Otm Joe thinks that Wealth is too Tory by half.
How can one aooount for it, how,
That the hot devotees of the Golden Calf
Turn their backs on the Brummagem " Cow"?
A Happy Return of the Day.—When the excellent Justice of
that name recovered from his indisposition.
Out of Place.—Childehs, ex-M.P. for Pontefract.
THE GRAND OLD MINSTREL.
Morning.—News of my singing "Home Sweet Home," at the
Orphanage, seems to have caused intense interest in the country.
Fifty-six letters on subjeot to-day. Perhaps, after all, it was a mis-
take speechifying to hardy Scots—should have sung 'em national
ditties instead. Herbert suggests, "with bagpipes accompaniment."
YeB, oertainly, bagpipes 1 Capital idea. Half a mind to write to
Edinburgh Committee, and offer to give 'em a new (Musical) Midlo-
thian Campaign—shall practise " Scots Wha Hae" to-night.
Enterprising American Theatre Manager writes to ask if I'm open
to an engagement to sing " The Last Rose of Summer," at ten
guineas a night, between first and second Acts of Othello. Says it
would be sure to bring down house. He could, if I preferred it, in-
troduce "Hush-a-Bye, Baby" into // Trovatore, only it would be
best with a few alterations, topical allusions, &c.; he sends two lines
for a specimen :—
"Hush-a-bye, Chamberlain, just for a bit!
When the Kads rant, the Party will split," &c.
Don't see my way to this, somehow.
Flattering note from organiser of Ballad Concerts. Says he's
going to have an " Irish Night" soon, and recommends me to practise
Moore's Melodies, and the "Exile of Erin," with what he calls
its " beautiful refrain of Erin-go-Bragh." Erin go hang! I say.
And this after Parnell's atrocious ingratitude! Shall write to say
I've had enough Irish Melodies for some time—my next "Irish
N^ight" will probably be in the House, and then won't the " Exiles
from Erin " repent that Circular!
Mid-Day.—Found my voice a trifle husky, so went to Village

charming Ballad of the " Busy Bee," which Stephen's Organist has
just set to music for me. Notioed some of the children a little in-
attentive—others put their fingers in their ears and made faces—
afraid my voice must have been very husky. However, after sink-
ing " Busy Bee" for a couple of hours, I left amid enthusiastic
cheers from little girls and boys. Curious they should cheer more
when I go than when I arrive. Shows magic of personal influence, I
suppose.
After Lunch.—Deputation of Cheshire Liberals just called. Seemed
despondent. Wanted to know what I thought of Elections. Also
wanted some "cheerful message from Hawarden" to carry back
with tbem. Reminds me of a Pretty Present from Scarborough."
To-morrow's polling-day, it seems, in Western Division of county.
Told Cheshire Liberals I had exhausted politics up in Midlothian,
but if they liked I'd sing them " Pop go the Counties !" to the tune
of" Pop goes the Weasel!" as a duet with Mrs. Gladstone. Cheshire
Liberals didn't seem to take to idea. Asked, doubtfully, if my song
had any reference to Disestablishment, or Three Acres and a Cow?
None whatever, I told them, but there's a nice little song I was
practising, about how a Cow jumped, or tried to jump, over the
Moon, which I should be happy to sing to them on the Bpot. Cheshire
Liberals suddenly found they had to catch a train, and went off
hurriedly.
Later.—Must really interrupt little boys and girls at village school
again. Can't practise songs with choruses anywhere else, and
Herbebt's done such a soreaming parody of "Mary had a little
Lamb." The first verse goes like this—
Lowther told a little cram,
How Trade was sure to go;
But everywhere where Lowther went
The Voters all said " No." &o.
Rosebeby (who's staying here) says he thinks a breakdown dance
introduced into song would improve it. Really surprised at Rose-
bery. Ask him to acoompany me to village school. Says he's got
such a bad toothache he doesn't like to. Query.—Is this a mere
excuse P
Evening.—Enjoyed myself at school tremendously juBt now.
Don't know if children did, however. Message brought from Village
Schoolmaster. Says there's a mutiny in school. It seems his pupils
have looked him into a coal-cellar, and won't let him out, unless he
promises "not to have any more choruses." Says "he himself
admires my voice immensely, and thinks it beats Sims Reeves hollow,
but his scholars don't." Then why doesn't he whip his scholars, I
want to know? Orphans the best, after all.
End up day with practising Lady Giffard's charming song of
"I'm sitting on a Stile, Mary," and go to bed hoarser than ever.
New Spelling.—Mr. Chamberlain's Radical Programme is not
to the taste of the Moderate Liberals, who, with a view to a coalition
and his utter discomfiture, proclaim their hope of being "Whig-
Tory-ous in the future!"

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Glamour (published by Swann, Sonnenschtsin & Co.), a Novel, by
Wanderer.—As this is a fairly interesting plot, bat too much spun
out. the Author may be congratulated on the non de plume of
"Wanderer" which he has seleoted. To those who remember the
old-fashioned saying, " Well, wanders will never cease," the faot
that in this instance they are limited to three volumes, is as great a
consolation as was given by one of Frank Talfourd's characters in
some burlesque, who, on being informed that
"The King, alas! is wandering in his mind,"
replies— "lie can't go far, the space is too confined."
Eminent Doctors, 2 Vols. (John Hogg, Publisher), by G. T. Bet-
tany, and we may bet any money that a more interesting book
on the subject will not easily bs found. It is to be speoially recom-
mended to obstinate and unreasonable Anti-vivisectionists. The
whole book is generally instructive, and that about Jenner speoially
so. What a Chamberfainite Jenner would have been if Josephus
the Radical had been his contemporary, and in Jenner's struggling
days, during his first enthusiasm for vaccination, had offered him
"the Three Acres and a Cow." How delighted Jenner would have
been, and how celebrated the cow would have become in history!
A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens has been published by
Routledges' in the very convenient, well got up, and most readable
form which we praised in mentioning the volume of Hood's Comic
Poems of this same series. The only fault is that the pages not only
require cutting, a sufficient nuisance at any time—but most careful

another, so that unless the reader has plenty of leisure and a good
stock of patience, he will make a nice mess of a very pretty book.

R>•flections of a Defeated Candidate.
Of course I shall look small for a time at the Club, and shan't be
able to swagger quite so much before acquaintances and relatives.
But shall I really care?
Shan't I be precious glad to escape that penal servitude down at
the House every night P—and rejoice to know that I haven't got to
pass hours on hours in those confounded Committee Rooms?
After all, was I ever likely to make a figure in the House?
Had I, in faot, ever opened my mouth in it? And do I think I
ever should have opened my month in it?
Do I really then envy my political opponent his seat?
Won't he have to be slaving about the constituency when I'm a
free man P
Won't he have to be sitting up to the small hours in the morning,
when 1 'm in bed and fast asleep P
Won't he be tied officially by the leg when I'm off for the Moors P
Shall I then be down in the mouth became I have come in at the
bottom of the Poll?
No, certainly not. But still, while I philosophise, shan't I look
forward to getting in next time P

Well, Joe's a good sort, but it's rather a joke
To hear him complaining of rancour!
When Mr. Gladstone next officiates as Reader in Hawarden
Established Churoh, he will probably give a sigh of relief when he
says,1' Here endeth the first Lesson." It has been a pretty severe one.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [December 12, 1885.
SORROWS OF A METROPOLITAN CANDIDATE.
The Finale.
The agonies of the awful night that followed my friend's fearful
revelation I shall never forget. I dreamt that I was imprisoned in
Her Majesty's gaol of Newgate as, I was informed, a first-olass
Miscreant, whioh necessitated my wearing the prison uniform, and
submitting to the most unnecessary degradation of having my hair
cut. My looks being rather sparse, than superabundant, I naturally
resisted, when the dock from the neighbouring Churoh of St.
Sepulohre announced the arrival of the two Sheriffs, in full state-
dress, to witness the execution of the solemn oeremony, and 1 made
such a final desperate effort to save my favourite front curl—which I
cultivate in memory of a celebrated deceased Earl—that I awoke in
a profuse perspiration, to find my alarmed attendant rocking me
violently, under the impression that I was in a fit!
I dressed myself hurriedly, told my man to paok my trunk for a
somewhat lengthy run abroad, and then sent off a note to my Agent
informing him of my awful discovery, and of my determination to at
onoe go away, on the ground of my health having suddenly broken
down under the unwonted exoitement of the last three months.
Having made certain necessary arrangements, of a pecuniary
character, I was busily engaged in consulting a Continental Bradshaxo
when my Agent hurried breathlessly in. He brought with him a
copy of the awful Act that is such a terror to all Candidates and
Agents alike, and proved conclusively, to my supreme satisfaction,
that the olause that had caused me such a night of agony did not
apply to me, but merely to any of my friends who might, out of
respeot to me, have acted as I had done!
He also brought me the somewhat startling intelligence that our
Solitical opponents, trusting to the_ division in our ranks, had
etermined to start a Candidate of their own WTong way of thinking.
Seeing that I had looked rather downcast at this serious intimation,
he hastened to demonstrate to me that this greatly improved my
chance of success, somewhat in this fashion. There were some GOOO
Eleotors duly enrolled on the Parliamentary Register of my Distriot,
as qualified to vote at the ensuing Election. Deducting from that
number the customary ten per cent, for Prisoners, Invalids, Lunatios,
Absconding Debtors, and the like, there remained 5400 free and
independent Electors, whose sweet voices I had been soliciting for the
last three months. While there were but two Candidates it would
necessarily require 2701 votes to ensure a majority, while with three
Candidates, of course 1801 would suffice for the obtaining of that end
and objeot of my laudable ambition, constituting a saving of no less
than 900 in the number of votes necessary to obtain the same result.
With this oheering news ringing in my ears I at onoe countermanded
all my instructions necessary to a contemplated prolonged absenoe,
and onoe again busied myself in that mass of correspondence, con-
nected with inquiries concerning my politioal opinions, which 1 had
spent weeks in a vain endeavour to overtake, and retired early to rest
fatigued, but radiant with hope. Nothing particular occurred during
the next week. We were making, I was assured, slow but steady
progress, and in about another fortnight I should, in all human proba-
bility, be entitled to be addressed with the magio letters M.P. after my
humble name. But on the following Monday I rebeived a very
fomidable-looking epistle addressed from the Club, which I
perused with the profoundest astonishment. It informed me that the
Political Committee of the Club were taking quite an absorbing
interest in my Eleotion, and that one of the Whips of the party would
give me a call on the following day just to talk matters over. It was
marked—see no one in the meantime. I read the letter over and over
again with mingled feelings of gratification and doubt, great gratifi-
cation at the honour oonferred upon me, slight doubt as to the result.
The next day I was visited by, 1 think, without any exception, the
pleasantest, the joiliest, in every respect the most agreeable and
gentlemanly man I ever saw. He began by apologising for his ap-
parent intrusion, for whioh, orders from head-quarters must be his
excuse, then rattled on about what a jolly thing it was to be an M.P.
provided you get into the right set. How pleasures and nalaoes
tempted one to roam, what jolly parties the Prinoe gave, asked what
I thought of the Mikado, had I seen graceful Kate in ExceUior, the
Grandest Ballet of modern times, and finally, was he in time for
iunoh? He rattled on all lunch-time, and then rose to leave, and
actually took up his hat with a joke about our meeting again in an-
other place, so t ventured to remind him that he had not mentioned
the objeot of his visit, when he laughed and said that was just like
him, though after all it was a mere matter of form, but the fact was
that as it was most desirable to make my seat safe, and as there were
three Candidates for it, it was, of course, necessary that one should
retire, and he had therefore oome to propose that I and my first op-
ponent, who were both on the right side, should agree to arbitration.
Of course there was no doubt, from what he had heard, that the other
fellow would have to go, but as it was neoessary to go through the
form, if I would just sign the agreement, whioh he had brought with
him to save trouble, it would doubtless be all right. I naturally
expressed my surprise at this sudden suggestion and the absolute
necessity of consulting my Agent, when he laughed again, and said,
"I suppose he's a Lawyer, and presume you know the name of the
god of a Lawyer's idolatry—Costs, so that would be a mere waste of
time and a large addition to bis little Bill."
Seeing that I still hesitated, he said that there could not possibly
be a better introduction to public life than to oblige your Party, nor
a worse one than to refuse them a favour, and that if I were the
stronger Candidate, I should win in any case, and if the weaker, lose.
I need only add that I at length signed the agreement, and we parted
with mutual professions of good-will, and gratifying anticipations of
many a pleasant meeting in store.
I draw a veil over my interview with my astounded Agent, who
used language that both surprised and pained me. Suffice it to say, that
I named my referees, and so did my opponent, and after four days of
mental anxiety, and four nights of abnost sleepless misery, I reoeived
the decision whioh, to my unspeakable astonishment, was against
mel

A STEEL PEGASUS.
[" Poets take to tricycling in the intervals of inspiration."—Daily Tele-
graph, December 3rd ]
And one who's a ohurchwarden,
Strange things I 've witnessed in
my time.
In all kinds of society—
'Twould puzzle me to put in
rhyme.
Their infinite variety!
I've seen a Beadle, underfed,
Devoid of all pomposity;
A Magistrate quite off his head,
By reason of jocosity;
A gentleman—delightful, bland,
An Income-tax Commissioner,
and
A popular parishioner!
Philanthropists regarding folks
With just a grain of charity;
A wit who laughed at others'
jokes,
With some sign of hilarity!
And once I saw a olever old
Good Bishop on a bioyole—
But never yet did I behold,
A Poet on a Tricycle!
ABBEY THOUGHT-AT_ST. ALBAN'S.
Sih E. Beckett has been pulling down a Norman turret at
St. Alban's, and apparently alarming Mr. James Nkale, F.S.A.
That gentleman, writing to the Times, referring to the conduct of
the worthy Baronet in question, observes, '' that as he is the only
person who has any authority at St. Alban's, there being no Com-
mittee, and the Bishop and Clergy having no power, where will the
destruction end if he does not interfere f" It is impossible, of
course, to answer this question. It appears, from Mr. Nbale's re-
port, that "the springer beneath" the turret shows the original
Norman design at the end of the transept, and that as they had
stood for eight hundred years, there is no reason why they should
not have stood eight hundred years more. The " springer " beneath
the turret being in suoh good, and evidently active condition, cer-
tainly suggests "life in the old stone yet," and does not seem to
warrant demolition. Still, there are springers and springers, and in
this ease Sir E. Beckett appears to have sprung a mine on the de-
fenceless Bishop and Clergy; and Mr. Neale oonoludes his ownmuni-
oation by stating, appealingly, "Other portions of the building are
being pulled down as I write this." This is quite pathetic but
it is difficult to see who is. to help him; and it is only to be hoped
that Sir E. Beckett's restoring zeal will be satisfied when the
offending springer is secured and removed.
Lord Randoli>h the other day quoted Boi locutus est, and added
that he meant Boss spelt with double s, to be taken as an Ameri-
oanism for Chief or Master, in allusion to Mr. Gladstone. Bos locutus
est recently, and that Bos is the Rural Voter.
Truth is disposed to think that the rejection of Earl Pehct for the
Berwiok Division of Northumberland, was due to the personal un-
popularity of the Duke and of "his Agent, Mr. Snowball." The
case is dear; blaok boll against Snowball.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Thebe ia an interesting artiole, in The Fortnightly Magazine of
this month, bytLady Dilke, entitled "Franoe under Richelieu." It
is amusing to be reminded how the Great Cardinal dealt with
the Academicians, and made them vote exaotly as he wished, just
at this moment when Baron Alphonse de Rothschild has been
elected a member of the Frenoh Academy, on account of the use he
has made of his vast wealth for encouragement of Art. What view
would Richelieu have taken of the oandidature of the Semitic
Millionnaire? Perhaps the Cardinal would have recommended the
Olympians to provide a seat among the Wits and Literati for the
Plutocrat as a Jew d'etprit. This would at once have given
him the necessary qualification. A propos of the Fortnightly, we
are very glad to know that its able Editor, Mr. Escott, has recovered
from his recent severe illness, and is now only in need of some few
weeks' rest and change, in order to complete his cure.
In the Nineteenth Century, Professor Hcxley deals with Mr. Glad-
stone's Daum of Creation, and bowls over its eminent author as easily
as if he were a riokety nine-pin. ^The Professor does it so pleasantly,
too, and yet most effectually, genially leoturing the Ex-Premier on
the absurdity of dealing with subjects on whioh other people are as
well, and indeed better, informed than himself. It is a warning to
the Wersatile Woodman not to trespass on the ground at present
held by the Professor and his scientific allies, where they are quite at
home, but where even such a universal genius as the Wersatile
Woodman of Hawarden is only a rash intruder. Professor Huxlet's
rebuke of such temerity is the more valuable, as it comes with all
the special authority which personal experience of having done exactly
the same thing himself, ana having been floored by Mr. St. Geobqb
Mxvaht—Bravo St. George v. Dragon!—oan give. Of course, Mr.
Gladstone's artiole in the Nineteenth, was on a matter as entirely
out of his line as Theology and Patristio learning are out of Professor
Huxlei's; and while not claiming to speak with the authority of
"one who knows," Mr. Gladstone inconsistently assumed the tone
of a writer whose opinions on any subject must be worthy of all
attention. Mr. Huxley comes iu between Mr. Gladstone and M.
Reville, not as an impartial referee, but as a Mephistophelei running
in under Reville-Fault's arm. and piercing the very weak oase of
Gladstone- Valentine, The Wersatile Woodman had better leave
Genesis alone, and confine himself to an exegesis on the authenticity
and genuineness of the Btory of Joseph with his " Three Acres and
Cow;" or, if he will drop into poetry, let him sing " Homer, Homer.
Sweet, Sweet Homer," and stink to the works of that distinguished
Greek Poet,—who has always been the Early Bard that oatches the
Wersatile Woodman.
There is an amusing article in The Cornhill, on "Superfine
English," in which the Editor—evidently the Editor, Author of Payn-
ful Literary Reminiscences, Low Spirits, Buy a Proxy and a few
other novels, to the extent of twenty dozen or so,—gives it warm to
modern pedants who say and write "Camella" instead of Camelia.
and with " in the ciroumstanoes " for " under the oiroumstanoes," and
so forth. Then he instances the old difficulty about " The two first
Chapters," which is very oommon, and "the two first Norman
Kings." whioh is very uncommon, as who ordinarily talks about Nor-
man Kings at all P The pedant objects, says Mr. Patn, that " there
cannot conceivably be two first," and then he retorts "Nonsense!
we oan have fifty firsts, if the sovereign people so wills it."
We don't quite go with Mr. Patn here. There oan be "fifty first
persons," all equal, in the first line of battle, or in the first row of the
stalls. But how oan the sovereign will of the people make fifty
first Kings? The sovereign will of the people oan do a great many
idiotio things, and this may be one of them. Mr. Pain does not
confute his pedant with an Academic example, which ought to have
come to his hand at once; for, he could have asked, if there oan't be
"two firsts," how is it that a University man can take " a double-
first "T
In a race there oan be a dead heat of two first horses, and so, if
there are three volumes, cannot the pedant have the lot thrown at hiB
head, and the couple that hit the mark together will be the two first
volumes? Then, as to the " Infant Phenomenon," whioh, Mr. Patn
considers, has made its mark on the literature of the country,
dearly because Charles Dickens created her in Nicholas Nickleby.
Mr. Pays' says that the pedants object to the " Infant Phenomenon."
But it is not the pedant alone who will question the propriety of
applying the " Infant Phenomenon" to a girl, for didn't Mrs. Rams-
bottom Junr., observe, when she heard her niece use the term, " My
dear, you must remember that a girl is the feminine gender, there-
fore, what you ought to have said is, that she is an " Infant Pheno-
mena." Superfine English as she is " spoke" and written would bear
further illustration at the hands of the Cornhill Magazinist.

A BALLAD OF THE GREAT ELECTION BATTLE.
December, 1885.
(Some way after Draytoit's Ballad of Agincourt.)
Well it thine age became,
Willis, of warlike fame,
Who did the signal aim
To our thinned forceB;
Whilst, from a meadow by,
With a low bovine cry,
County Democracy
Swelled our resources.
Faib stood the wind (we thought),
Ere the great fight was fought,
Muoh hoping, fearing nought,
On marched our heroes.
But when, whilst banners flew,
First Orange closed with Blue,
Oar hopes soon tumbled to
Chillest of zeros!
When in his height of pride,
Joe did the foe deride,
And " Ransom " loudly cried,
Many offending;
When he forgot the while
Rob Roy's not English style,
Cecil did darkly smile,
Misohief portending.
And, turning to his men,
Quoth our sage William then,
"Bearded in our own den?
I am amazed!
But battles ill begun
By pluck are often won.
Close ranks, and fight like fun!
Joe has gone crazed.
"But for myself," quoth he,
This my last fight may be.
England will mook at me,
No more esteem me,
If vanquished I remain.
In this great fray fall slain;
Close up, and charge again
Loss to redeem me I
"' Eighty' our foes may tell,
When most their pride did swell,
Under our swords they fell,
Not less our skill is
Than when great Ben we beat;
That conquest we '11 repeat
If yon but follow fleet
One standard—Willie's 1"
Joe, sulking, hung his head,
William to vanward sped,
And the whole phalanx led.
Flushed with past glories.
Habtington had the rear
No braver man was there,
Oh, Lord I how hot they were
On the proud Tories 1
Down hurled the rustic crew.
Then soon the foeman knew,
These new recruits were true,
If they were tardy.
Upwards the Blue polls went,
Down were the Orange sent,
And the foe's host was rent,
Though late so hardy.
This while the Unorown'd King,
His Erae axe brandishing,
Down on our rear did ding
As to o'erwhelm it.
Forward still Willie went,
Though with muoh blood besprent,
Whilst many a oruel dent
Bruised his old helmet.
Joe to his'standard stood
Cow or, field vert. "No good P"
Cried he. in swelling mood,
"Where's snob, another P"
He in brave steel, and bright,
Though but a youngish Knight,
Tet in that furious fight
Raised a rare pother.
Dilke held a stubborn pike,
Habcocbt as Thor did strike,
Smiting down smashers like
Hammer on anvil;
Morley his axe did ply,
Bright and young Rosebeby
Bore them right doughtily,
Derby and Granville!
All in December grey
Fought was this wondrous fray.
Brave Britons, as when they
Lopped the French lilies 1

WRITE AND WRONG.
The onslaught of the Advanced Economists on the School Board
expenditure has not been long in making itself felt. At the General
Meeting, on Wednesday last, Mr. Barnes proposed, and the Reverend
Charles Lawrence seconded, a motion to cut off at one fell swoop
the salary of £300 paid to the Secretary of the Chairman, coupling
the proposition with the suggestion that that official could very well
manage all his correspondence himself. To this the Reverend
Joseph Djggle, the Chairman in question, demurred, and was sup-
ported in his objeotion by Mr. Buxton, who said he considered the
whole business, to call a spade a spade, a regular dig at the authority
of the Chair, and that it was an attempt to subject Mr. Djgole to
infra dig. conditions. The motion was therefore eventually lost,
there being a majority of thirty against it; it being no doubt the
opinion of the Board that £800 a-year for Mr. Diggle's Secretary
could not be regarded in the light of prodiggle expenditure.
Too Bad I
The Election, itself, was a hideous bore.
Which moved us to wrath, yet we strove to restrain it.
But what makes a fellow with anger boil o'er,
Are the fellows, with figures, who want to explain it!

accorded to the work
of any author dur-
ing his lifetime.
Mr. Toole introduces a promising Young Dramatist. Whether the new
Place in Piccadilly,
between the Criterion and the Pavilion, will be decorated with two
statues of the Great Twin Brethren, Cox and Box, embraoing after
the discovery of the non-existence of the strawberry mark on the left
arm, has not yet been decided by competent authority, but it is no
breach of confidence to hint that the notion would not be received
with disfavour in the very highest quarters. Maddison Place would
be a good name, and our Soulpists could go to work with designs for
statues at once.
But when will the day of farces, good roaring, screaming, laugh-
able farces, return? Something that you could drop into,—and that
critics would drop into nowadays probably,—about nine, and
enjoy, without troubling oneself beforehand to know any more
than that certain actors were safe to be seen at certain theatres, and
that a hearty langh could be insured. Charles Mathews used, at
one time, to play in two or three farces a night, Weight and Bed-
ford always in one, if not two, and so did Bcckstone, at the Hay-
market, and the Keelbys, wherever they happened to be. A good
farce is the essence of what it is a modern fashion to term a faroial
play, and had it pleased Mr. Maddison Morton to do Going It in
one Act and one scene, he could have got as much fan into it, and
Mr. Toole would have got as muoh fan out of it, as they both do
now in double the time and treble the Acts.
However, it is better to leave well alone, so Going It will go it in
three Acts—and a lot of the dialogue does really "go" with roars;
only if Mr. John L. Toole will take a humble friend's advice, it is,
—out out the burlesque The O'Dora,—for who in December reool-
leots anything about the week of Thiodora with the French Company
this summer P—play Going It at 8'30, and wind up the evening with
the shortest and funniest farce in the repertoire of the only actor

has become of The Blighted Being f Why shouldn't Mr. Toole
revive that P—or Jacob Earwig in Boots at the Swan t Mr. Toole
could go in for a ran of the old farces, and then have some new ones
ready, and these, with a short domestio drama on the model of The
Postboy, and a little brushing up of everything and everybody
generally, would give this little theatre a speciality, which would
mean constant change and continual Buooess.
Mr. VixxiEBS of the New Pavilion, Piccadilly, or, to put it in
sixpenny telegram style, Mr. Pavlllers, ought to do a rare good
business in this richly decorated and commodious hall. The old
seating arrangements are here retained for audience and Chairman.
As to the latter, would not his proper plaoe be in the centre of the
hall facing the stage, so that he may catch the singer's eye, rule the
waiters, welcome the coming, and speed the parting guest—all the
guests have to "part," and the quicker they do it the better,—keep
the game alive, and preserve order with his hammer and stentorian

Mr. Pavilliers, who has got the place " For a
Mere Song."
voioe? Certainly these are among the principal duties of a good
Chairman. But then how could he keep an eye on the gallery if it
were behind him P In case of any disturbance there, he could not
quell it with a look, nor diminish the storm with his hammer, nor
single out the offender for instant removal, with an "Off-with-his-
head,-and-8o-muoh-for-ohuckine-'em" kind of air. No, we admit
that the Chairman of a Music Hall must be so placed as to have his
eyes everywhere. "We met, 'twas in a crowd, and his eye was upon
me," ought to be the feel-
ing of every individual in
that assemblage. But
it seems to me a mistake
to have the seats and
tables at right angles to
the stage, so that everyone
wishing to see the perfor-
mers must sit with a
twisted neck all the even-
ing, exoept in those few
intervals when there is
nothing going on, and
when the muscles can be
relaxed, and refreshment
taken gratefully. Such a
position in a Music Hall
for three hours is enough
to turn anyone's head.
As for the entertain-
ment, Mr. Arthur
Lloyd's "Encore" polka
song is nearly as fresh as
when it first came out. Mr.
James Fawn is one of the
Fawniest men on the Music
Hall stage; and Mr.
Hunter, hunting for a
partner for his dance, ex-
hibits a good bit of genuine
pantomime.
To me a source of peculiar enjoyment at a Music Hall is the scenery,
which is usually so singularly appropriate to the character of the
singer and the song. At the Oxford there was—and perhaps it
still exists—an interior, representing some portion, apparently,'of
the Library at Lincoln's Inn or the Inner Temple; and here, in-
variably, the comic singer, arrayed in that quiet kind of costume
whioh, being of the essence of good taste, is never calculated to
attract any special attention, used to come in, and, taking advan-
tage of the unusual circumstance of there being no one in the
reading-room, at once commenced a series of highly amusing songs,
whioh, though demanding considerable vocal and physical exertion,
failed to arouse even an under-librarian. Then there was a
Baronial Hall, where a dashing young lady appeared, and walked
about the stage in a white hat and light dust-coat, singing some-
thing about "Dear boy, don't jer know," and "doing the la-di-
da,"—and all this, of course, by the kind permission of the feudal
proprietor, who might be supposed, like Christopher Sly in the
Taming of the Shrew, to be witnessing the performance from a
tribune, or private box. Most of the songs at the Pavilion are given
in what is apparently one of the Gardens of the Vatican, in front of
an archway ornamented with classic statues. Here the Pinauds, pro-
bably favourites with His Holiness Leo the Thirteenth, perform.
The Pinauds are a remarkable trio. I beg the spectators to follow
their plot closely; it may appear at first sight a little intricate, but
further acquaintance with it will prove that, for neatness of con-
struction, d ramatio effeot, and sustained perspicuity—especially where
the third Plnaud enters disguised with a tremendous false nose and
movable moustachios—it may be pronounced as absolutely unrivalled.
That the Cytherean Venus with her doves—whioh is a very poetical
way of expressing Madame Garetta with her playful pigeons—
should give her performance in the vicinity of an edifice whose
architectural characteristics are suggestive of some confusion in the
painter's mind between the Alhambra in Leicester Square and the
Cathedral of St. Mark's, Venice, is exactly what one would have
expected from the mixed nature of the associations. But, to be quite
up to date, the scene should represent the exterior of the British
M useum, where a sort of Doveoot Drama might be enacted, called, The
Mystery of the Museum, or the Pitiless Pigeon Poisoner. Of course,
the birds should appeal to their Queen, and Madame Garetta—by the
way, for the sake of antithesis, the villain should be represented by
Signor Basemento—should then appear, and reocue her birds; Base-
mento sinks to the coal-hole, and after the Queen and her pigeon*
have enjoyed themselves, up should ascend Madame Garetta.
The temperature having been down to about freezing-point last
week, Mr. Pavillters' Patent Sliding Roof must have had a capital
time of it. A sliding roof, I fancy, oame in about the time that
The ~

after Christmas, when there are new songs and plenty of novelties,
there will be a difficulty to find seats; and, as to the re-seats, well,
pookets sufficiently big will have to be made to hold them.
Coming out, I heard a muddled young man asking his friend " If
the Pavilion wasn't onoe at Brighton f Then immediately he cor-
rected himself, and said, "Oh, no, I remember, that was the Hall by

LETTER TO THE RIGHT HON. J. CHAMBERLAIN.
(Care of the St. Bon. Mr. Punch.)
Mt dear Joseph (the Lesser I fear I must call you, remembering
Joseph the Bigoar), I sincerely regret to observe, from your recent
remarks, that you do not appear, since the late elections, to have
abated in the slightest degree the bump of self-esteem which is so
remarkable a feature of your conformation. I really think that you,
and my excellent friend John Ttndall, who always writes to the
Times to tell us what he thinks, when anybody is in doubt about
anything, run a bump-race in that respect. Whatever the merits of
your famous difference about Lights, neither of you has any mis-
givings about his own.
But you see, my dear, clever Joseph, now that all the shillaloo has
subsided,—that nothing particular has happened to anybody,—and
that everything is very much as it was before,—the world has the
time to take, so to speak, stock of you; and it is proceeding to do it.
You have introduced into English public life certain methods of your
own, which are new to it.
First, you have trumpeted your own' differences of opinion from
your colleagues all about the place. I don't think free discussion
does any harm, so I won't grudge you that. But, secondly, you
have amused yourself by calling them all the bad names you oan
think of, because they don't agree with you about everything. As
far as I oan see, only Dilke and Moblet do. You don't make
friends by that, my dear Joseph, for, in this imperfect world,
manners go for as much as measures.
Thirdly, you have taken upon yourself to star yourself everywhere
as a kind of extra Prime Minister, with a mandate from the Queen
or from the Party, or from the Publio, none of whom appears to have
had the slightest desire to give it you. The mandate, my excellent
Joseph, was entirely your own. And lastly, you have made the
name of Radical objectionable, even, and most ef all, to those who
used to be most proud of it, by dinningaway about" We Radicals,"
and" "We Radical Chiefs'—wherein Dilke and Morlet have too
much helped you. The name of Liberal should be good enough for
anybody, nor need it shame the English Radical to have been of
company of the lost Fawcett, or to take part with Mundella, Brtce,
or Dillwtn. But your tenets do not seem, my clear Joseph, the least
like theirs: and if the electors once take it into their heads that
these same tenets of yours are simply what they have been said to be,
Jacobin—that they are the reversal of sound English Radical ideas—
and that not only the State, but a series of little States within a
State, are, according to you, to do everything for everybody, whether
he likes it or not, till an Englishman's whole life becomes a kind of
compulsory vaccination—then, my dear Joseph, they will have very
little to say to you. You ana Dilke and Moblet will form a
nioe little Fifth Party, all to yourselves, unless, which is not wholly
improbable, you can get Randolph to join you.
Whilst the election was pending, sober men thought it best to
let you have your fling. But they will be bound# to give you their
minds now you have had it, and assure you that it is not the weak-
knee'd, but the strong-backed, who object to you most — that is,
supposing always vou mean what I am bound to say it seems to me
you do mean. Mr. Punch, the unprejudiced and ever-fair, will
allow me to express my opinion, in which 1 am not alone, that you have
done the Liberal cause as much harm as the most self-seeking could
desire. You are not a Radical in the English sense at all, however
fnnd you may be of parading the name; and if Benjamin's mess, in
1880, seemed to some big, it is an unecriptural fact that, in 1885,
Joseph's mess is—looking at those into whose hands you have
worked so hard to throw the balance of power—well, Bigoar.
Confidentially Yours, Stratton Strawless.

Radical majorities in many of the English
Counties are composed of new voters; and
these men simply gave their votes in return
for a promise that they should be put in pos-
session of something belonging to somebody
else." There is a sweet simplicity about this
way of settling matters whioh inspires emu-
lation. For example, suppose we say that
the Tory majorities—and minorities—in the
Counties gave their votes as they did in order
to retain possession of something belonging to
somebody else. It is equally true—or false—
and at least as much might be reasonably
said in defence of it by any one who knows
anything of the way in which possession of
"something belonging to somebody else"—
in the shape of land—has often and for long
been obtained in this country. And then it
is so simple, so unqualified, and saves such a
lot of that trouble whioh a respect for faots
and fairness necessarily involves.

NON TAILI AUXILIO.
A Protest aoainst the Muzzle-Men.

The little Dog laughed to see such fun!"
rjs adjourned meeting
of the Metropolitan
Dots' Defence Asso-
ciation was held at
the premises of the
Kennel Club yester-
day, and was largely
attended. For some
time prior to the com-
mencement of the pro-
ceedings every avail-
able portion of the
yard was occupied by
an orderly ana well-
behaved oanine crowd,
who followed the
course of events with
the greatest interest.
A Prize St. Ber-
nard, being voted
unanimously into the
Chair, he rose and
said: That, in open-
ing the subject he
need not, he felt, do
more than chronicle
the cause of their
meeting there this
day. They, the dogs
of the Metropolis, of
all sorts ana condi
tions, were assembled
in that yard to protest
against the unjust,
intemperate, ana
frivolous interference
with their liberty just recently carried out, apparently at the sole fiat
of the Chief Commissioner of Police. (Howls.) He was glad to see
that the mention of that official elicited that expression of their
opinion. A more vexatious and troublesome measure it was impos-
sible to conceive, and he was determined, for one, to protest to his
utmost against it. (Marked and prolonged wagging of tails.) But
he would leave other speakers to have their say on the subject, and
suggest what remedy they could. {Loud barking.)
A Scotch Collie said that he considered the treatment he had been
personally subjected to, quite disgraceful. He had had his licence
properly paid for, and wore a collar bearing his owner's name and
address, and yet he could not leave the house, for a run with one of
the family, without having his head thrust into a horrid wire muzzle,
which bothered him to that extent, that it took all the pleasure out
of his outing. [Yelps.) In faot, he so disliked it, that he would
sooner not go out at all, and what, he shoul dlike to know, would
beoome of a dog of his size pegged up in the house all day? Why,
it was enough to give him rabies, if he hadn't got it. [Loud bark-
ing, and wagging of tails.)
A Bull Terrier said he thoroughly conourred with the last speaker.
For his part, he could only say, that muzzled or unmuzzled, he would
like to see the Policeman who would lassoo him. [Prolonged wag-
ging of tails.)
A Carriage Png, who appeared to be in a very plethorio condition,
and addressed the meeting with some difficulty, rose to protest. He
did not see what grievance his .canine brethren had. If they disliked
being muzzled, they should go in for drawing-room life, as he did.
He got his exercise in the Park, in an open barouche. (Howls.) They
might howl, but he did, and a precious good time he had of it.
(Snarling.)
A Frenoh Poodle replied to the last speaker with much warmth.
He said that it was all very well for carnage pets to ignore the
nuisance, but it was a most real and tangible one. Look at his own
case. Here was he, highly educated and trimmed, and frequently
taken on the back seat himself, yet he felt obliged, for the Bake of
his health, to maintain his running exeroise. Vet how did he get
it P Only by thrusting his head into Colonel Henderson's metal
oage (howls), and spoiling his moustache, and making himself look
generally miserable and ridiculous. It was a great hardship to thus
afflict respectably supported dors because a lot of ownerless ours and
mongrels were roving about loose, and bringing discredit on the
canine species generally. He hoped the peremptory order would
soon be rescinded. (Loud barking.)
A Thorough-bred Mastiff said, all he could say was, that if it
wasn't, the first time he could get a chance he should go out without
a muzzle. (Wagging of tails.) The Policeman who tried to collar
him with a three-foot iron rod had better look out for himself.
(Renewed wagging of tails.) That was all he had to say about it.
A Toy Terrier said that he got on very well with a bit of string,
and didn't mind being led. If dogs didn't wish to be kept muzzled,
they shouldn't be so big. (Prolonged howling.)
A large Newfoundland said, he treated that remark with the con-
tempt it deserved; and though he did not wish to introduce any
personality into the discussion, he oould not forbear saying that it
was greatly owing to the snapping propensities indulged in by that
class of abnormally undersized dogs to which the last speaker belonged
that all this vexatious agitation had arisen. (Great wagging of tails.)
He should conclude by moving the following Resolution:—" That this
meeting regards the recent order enforcing the indiscriminate appli-
cation of the muzzle to all dogs, of whatever kind or degree, at large,
as a useless, meddlesome, and vexatious exercise of authority, ana
is of opinion that steps should be taken to get it modified or repealed
at the very earliest opportunity possible."
Upon this Motion, which was seconded by a White Pomeranian,
being put by the Chairman, and carried unanimously, amid great
wagging of tails, accompanied by vociferous barking, the meeting
was about to be adjourned, when considerable commotion was caused
by a report that a Dachs-hund had suddenly gone off its head and
bitten several dogs in its immediate vicinity on the back benches.
The Police interfering in the matter, a general stampede followed,
and the assembly broke up hurriedly in much confusion.

"THE SWORD IS MIGHTIER THAN THE PEN."
(Old Proverb Improved.)
The IVmes Correspondent having been ordered to Rangoon by the
General Commanding the Burmese Expeditionary Force (it is to be
hoped because he would make jokes about the Capital turning upon
"Man-delay," as no other excuse for the conduct of General Prendeb-
oast, K.C.H., can be accepted as entirely satisfactory), we have
immediately supplied his place with a "special" of our own. "We
submit his first despatch:—
(By Private and Confidential Wire.)
The bravery of the troops, in storming the anoient stronghold of
Theebaw was admirable. Every soldier proved himself a hero, but
the greatest of them all, the most heroio of the heroes, was unques-
tionably Prendbrqast, who is known as "Bull-ee," which, being
translated from the nativepafoM into English, means, " The Wild
Lion of the Fieroe Battle Wagers." Never shall I forget the courage
displayed by this grand young soldier as he fought single-handed no
less than twelve dozen Burmans. The admiration and enthusiasm
caused by his gallantry was simply indescribable. Even the wives
of his fallen enemies cried with joy. His administration of the
country, after the sanguinary oombat which delivered the place into
his hands, equalled his martial prowess. In twenty minutes he had
introduced into the ".Land of the Shining Moon Magna Charta,
the Habeas Corpus Act, the sixpenny loaf at twopence-halfpenny,
the cheap parcels' post and the self-acting sewing machine. With
all this he is as merciful as he is clever, good-natured as he is
clear-headed, beautiful as he is well-read. Never has the world
seen so magnificent a celebrity, and the sight of suoh an Admirable
Crichton can not be repeated. Major-General Pkkndkrgast is a
mixture of all that was and is best in Napoleon, Shaksfeare,
Bolton, M.P., 8ir Robebt Walter Cardbn, and the cleverest per-
formers (inclusive of the damsel who plays with equal facility the
big drum and the German flute), of the Ladies' Viennese Orchestra.
The oonduot of Prendbrqast is magnificent, and yet may be called,
withperfeottruth, "the war."
P. 8.—Please, Sir, I hope you will like the above. If not adequately
complimentary, kindly supply the required epithets, &c.
[Editor's Note.—From internal evidence, it would seem that our Corre-

AFTEB THE ELECTION.
[By a Rejected Candidate.)
I'm weary of all the Election,
The bother, the noise, and the din,
And thongh I have suffered rejection,
I'm glad that I didn't get in.
If Parliament half as unpleasant
As all the wild shindies I see,
I 'm really quite pleased that at present
I 'm not to became an M.P.
The Whigs they fall fool of the Tories;
The latter serenely avow
The former tell terrible stories
About the Three Acres and Cow.'
Both sides were of course on their mettle,
And Candidates all on the rack;
It's just both the pot and the kettle
Deolaring the other is blaok.
I've shouted of coarse till my pharynx]
Has grown most consumedly red,
And doctors declare that my larynx
And I would be better in bed.
But, bless you, I made no impression
On ignorant voters arrayed;
They'.'ve left me one single possession,
And that is—a bill to be paid.
No matter, the conflict is over,
And I shall be off in a trice,
A free indeterminate rover—
I think Monte Carlo sounds nice.
Let Parliament meet, and be jigger'd I
I'm off to a sunnier clime,
Quite glad, on the whole, that I figured
Among the rejected this time.
Thb Mixture not as Before.—The next
Parliament will be—HoDOB-podge.
"IMPROVEMENT" AT ETON.
Diary of a Present Etonian.
Wednetday.—To-day is a whole holiday. I began sadly, and
didn't end well. I managed to get up early to prepare my French
lesson,* but I had not quite finished it when the clock struck, and so
I went on a little longer, because my Beak is generally late, but
when I got into school I found he had been np nearly ten minutes;
so I got a punishment, and, what's more, he put me on just the very
place where I had left off learning. Now, I've often noticed, that if
yon don't learn the last few lines of a lesson, the Beak is sure to put
you on just where you left off, and it seems such a remarkable
coincidence that he won't believe yon; but still, that's generally the
case, I assure you. I had a try to go through, and got on pretty
well till we came to the word "bras-caete," and that stumped me
completely; so I just took a shot and said brass-case," and every-
one burst out laughing. Fellows do laugh when you make a blunder
like that, though they don't properly know what it is themselves.
The Beak gave me a yellow ticket after school. I give it as a speci-
men of what a master can do. "Late always; most irregular:
doesn't know his lesson; translates 1 bra»-ca»t£' 'brass-case:' write
ont notes of lesson twice by lock-up." The poena was bad enough;
but, to put down the mistake for my Tutor to see, was adding insult
to injury.
Well, when I went to fagging, that brute Mottle sent me down
town for an omelette (I suppose he thinks an omelette is more
artistic than sausages), and I didn't get back till nearly nine; and
then, just as I sat down to breakfast, in comes one of my Tutor's
pupils to say that Tutor was going to have construing directly after
chapel: and so, instead of getting my breakfast, I had to learn my
lesson: because I was afraid that if I got muffed at construing, and
gave Tutor the ticket to sign as well, he would give me penal servi-
tude. So I went without breakfast.T Construing and all that went
on til. nearly half-past eleven: and after absence I went in search of
breakfast with Scrogglks. I had something at Laiton's: it wasn't
much ..ike breakfast, but helped to fill the corners up. It consisted
of a (lass of cider, a sausage-roll, a chicken and ham pad', three
bans, and a oup of chocolate. I hadn't any money, so I borrowed
* A 1 early French lesson sounds like an improvement, but the manner of
gettin f it up, will probably occur to some old boys, is not entirely new and
origin ri, and has been found to answer, more than once, with Ovid, Yiroil,
Hoot a, and Scriptoret Oraei.—Ed. f This seems an improvement.—Ed.
some from Sckogg y. * After that I did the poena, and took it to the
Master just before two: muoh to his disgust. He was expecting—
hoping, I should say—that I should be late once more.
After four we had a pretty decent game, and after tea I meant to
have done my extra work, only somehow I put it off. I always had
a special objection to composing on a whole holiday—I didn't stay to
supper, but came up and began my Diary—I have now a dear 20
minutes before I need have my bath, it's bath night, and so I think I
shall be able to patch up an extra work.
Tkurtday.—k. rather unfortunate event ooourred last night. I
found my extra work pretty easy, so I did it all: but it took me some
time, so the maid took away my candle, just as I was beginning to un-
dress. I hadn't another to light, but I was determined not to go with-
out my bath, so I undressed in the dark, and stepped in. I think my
dame must have heard me splashing about, and wondered what I was
doing, for he f came in to see what was the matter. He saw, and
retired promptly. In consideration of the unfortunate occurrence,
he let me off my punishment: at least, he only gave me a jaw
about sitting up late, both in my bath and in general: and that
doesn't count. I now had a fair field, and determined to take a fresh
start. I was going to have learnt my saying lesson for 11*15, after
9'45, but I remembered I hadn't copied over my verses, and had to
do that instead. So, when I got into school, I had to'go back to the old
dodge. The Beak 1 'm up to, sets us about 20 lines of Virgil, has four
fellows to say at a time, and divides the lesson into four bits of about
five lines each, more or less, as the stops go. Not so many Beaks do
that now as used to: I think the new Head Master has shaken them
up. But mine does. Well, as I hadn't time to learn the whole, I
only learnt the bit that would come to me, but he reversed the order
of saying, as he occasionally does, and there was I, dumb as a fish,
while all the other fellows knew theirs. So I was kept in till last.
To-day was a half-holiday once more, so that we've only had one
whole school-day this week, as yet, which isn't bad. t Nothing much
else happened to-day. * More improvements.—Ed.
t It may be necessary to explain that the "Dame" at Eton, is not neces-
sarily a "She." The Drawing Master, if he has a house for boys, is a Dame.
X Only by reckoning a whole holiday on Wednesday, preceded by a half on
Tuesday, followed by a naif on Thursday, a whole on Friday, and half on Satur-
day, can we make out that the Present Etonian had but one whole schoolday
in the seven days. If this is not an exceptional week, certainly there is a great
"improvement," at Eton, as to holidays, and so, as we've got through the
greater part of a specimen week, the Diary can end here, though, perhaps, the I
Present Etonian might enlighten us as to how the " Diet bom "is spent.—En. I

THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.
IX.—Fbom an Uncrowned (Marionettb) King.
Avondale, Monday.

eab Toby,
Hi! hi! "Walk up, walk
up! the greatest Marionette
show of the season. Eighty-
five of 'em, all sizes and
various names, with a ten-
dency towards O'Connor, war-
ranted to work together in har-
mony. If I hold up my right
hand, all fall flat on their
hack. Hi I hi! "Walk up,
walk up! If I crook my little
finger, they raise the left leg.
If I whistle, they jump up
and run towards me, stopping
with one accord when the
music ceases. Hi! hi! Eighty-
five representatives of free and
independent electors, all war-
rantad to vote as I hid 'em,
to Bpeak hy the hour when
instructed, to remain silent
when so ordered, not to leave
the premises without permis-
sion, in short, to do just what
they are told, ask no ques-
tions, and be thankful for
heir weekly wages. Hi! hi! Eighty-five of'em. "Walk up, walk up!
What do you think of that, Toby, for patter P It comes pretty near an un-
idorned description of the actual state of things, and though some of you fellows
nay sneer, and make believe to be shocked, I know very well it'« simply envy and
pprehension. Till R-nd-lph began to dominate the scene, the Conservatives
tad their men in hand pretty much in the same way. They grumbled some-
imes, but they voted straight. I wonder what Gl-dst-ne would give to have a
'arty as docile as mine? We have no above-the-ganeway, or below-the-gang-
ray. We have nothing answering to your Whigs, Liberals, or Radicals. We
.re not a Party. We are One Man and eighty-five counters, and when a division
s coming on that's something to reckon with, I can tell you.
How do I like my companions? Well, perhaps not much—but that's neither
lere nor there. I'm not bound to say too much to them, or to talk to them at
.11, and never have been notable for my geniality. I may respect the sterling
qualities of J-8-PH G-ll-b, without insisting upon sitting up all night with
dm. I may admire the tepid fluency of S-xt-it, without remaining to listen to
dm; and 1 may enjoy the high breeding and gentle manners of T. P. O'C-nn-b
it a distance. .Ton don't suppose that any other proprietor of a Marionette
show spends his leisure moments in company with his wooden-headed, loose-
ointed properties? We understand each other, au\fond, as Joey B. cays,
lever forgetful of his famous journey to Paris. They are well satisfied with
heir position, and I with mine. Moreover than which, our private relation-
ihips are nothing to nobody. You hear quite enough of as in public
Well, and how are/things going in London P We have been so busy here that
'.'ve hardly had time to read foreign intelligence. Ph-l C-ll-n gave me a deal
if trouble. Ph-l is a nice boy, sober and industrious in habit, and with most
eposeful manners. As I am not in the House much myself when the Session's
in, I had no objection to his turning up with the rest. But when he set himself
tp against my mandate it was a matter of importance to crush him. So I did. I
xpect it's all for the best. He means well, but is dangerous in a Marionette show,
t he went on the rampage he might break up the whole of the machinery.
)'Shea was another difficulty. I like O'Siiea. He once did me a good turn,
ind I was sorry to oppose him in Liverpool. I gave way, it is true; tmt it was
oo late, and the onlv thing I could do by way of compensation was to put in
)'Hba for Donegal West. Since the House can't have O'Shea, they must put up
rith O'Hea; it's only a matter of sex.
How will all this end. do you think? Things have not turned out quite so
veil as I expected. We did our best in the British Boroughs, and rooked I Reading
Gl-dst-ne of twenty-five. But the Counties were too
much for us, and have rather spoiled my little game.
But we stand pretty well, and I find myself an object of
respectful attention from the Leaders of both parties.
I am afraid that, after all, something will come of it,
and we shall have to go back to Dublin and enjoy our-
selves there. Fancy, after the comfortable Club at
Westminster, with its pleasant people and its varied
interests, to be shut up in a hall on College Green with
one or two hundred or my fellow-countrymen! I am a
little uneasy at the prospect. After all it may be post-
poned. R-nd-lph, in his happy-go-lucky manner, will
ask us to take what we want and go. Gl-dst-ne, with
his serious way of looking at things, will spend weeks in
elaborating a scheme which he would press upon our
acceptance. If it comes to the worst, of course the worst
must come. But a word in your ear, my Toby. When
the day arrives that sees Home Rule granted to Ireland,
and it it proposed that I shall sit in Dublin as the President
of a National Council, or whatever you like to call it, on
that day C. S. P. writes P. P. C. on his political visiting-
card, and passes it round.
In the meanwhile walk up! walk up! 'Hi! hi 1
Eighty-five of the most delightful, companionable, intel-
ligent Marionettes ever shown in leither Hemisphere.

RICH AND BARE.
It is well known that many of the presents sent to the
Sultan of Turkey, never found their way into the Imperial
Treasury, and therefore were unable to appear in the ex-
cellent descriptive article of the contents of that wonderful
storehouse, published a few days since in the columns of a
"morning paper." As it is the duty of all civilised persons
to supply the missing links, we beg to give a list of a few of
the most interesting, historical curiosities still remaining
unoatalogued, in Constantinople:—
From King Henry the Eighth of England.—Pamphlet
written by His Majesty against Lutheb, and for which,
the burly Monarch received from the Pope of the period
the title of " Defender of the Faith." Handsomely bound
in calf; it hears the inscription, " Prynted forre Pryvatte
Syrculation," in old English. This book is said to have
once belonged to Anne Boleyn, who used it for propping
up the leg of a wheel-chair that had lost its castor.
From Queen Elizabeth of England.—Portrait of Her
Majesty, set in diamonds (paste). The picture depicts an
exceedingly beautiful maiden, in the first blush of youth
—it was painted when the Queen was sixty-four. Also
the model of a potatoe presented to Her Majesty by Sir
Walter Raleigh.
From Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector.—Recipe for
the cure of warts, and the rules of a new game of his
own invention oalled "Leape-frogge."
From King Charles the Second of England. —A col-
lection (numbering many thousands) of old English wine-
bottles (empty).
From King William the Third and Queen Mary the
Stcond of England. — Portrait of the Kin? from the
Queen, and portrait of the Queen from the King. Also
a Treatise upon " Ye Difficulties of ye English Tongue,"
translated from the Dutch.
From Queen Anne of England.—Certificate of the
birth of Sarah, first Duchess of Marlborough, showing
that her Grace was many years older than she pretended
to be, with a spiteful letter from her Majesty, asserting
this fact.
From King George the First of England.—Intelligence
of the death of Queen Anne, his Majesty's predecessor.
From King George the Fourth of England.—A col-
lection of old wigs, and the oomplete works of R. B.
Sheridan, uncut.
From Napoleon, sometime Emperor of France.—Picture
of the Battle of Waterloo, by a French Artist (inaccurate).
And from Mr. Punch, Guide of the Universe.—The
gem of the collection. First Number of the London
Charivari (1841), set in its own sparkling coruscations of
wit and humour.
A Conservative Benefit {from their own point of
view).—Of what epidemio have the Conservatives relieved
Reading? Surely Fever.

The Serpentine was frozen oyer. The usual

ice. CheBtnuto were in season, and orangeB could

be obtained very cheaply at Covent Garden. The
Pantomime was in full swing at Drury Lane.
In fact, it was thoroughly seasonable weather.
Edwin dk Boots and Angelina de Slippers
were gaily exchanging tows of constancy as they
glided along on the Club Skates, when there was a
crash, an ejaculation of horror, and a disappearance.
In another moment the loving pair were under
water, and alone. But not for long. Suddenly they
were joined by an Italian, dressed in a slouch hat
and a.disguise-cloak. "Discovered!" exclaimed
Angelina. "My hated rival!" murmured
Edwin. It was an embarrassing situation.
Part II.—February Fidelity.
It was Valentine's Day. The limited space at
our command will not allow of our explaining
how Edward and Angelina escaped from the
Serpentine, but escape they did. And now Ange-
lina, by some mischance, found herself in the Ser-
pents' Cage at the Zoological Gardens. ""What
shall I do?" cried the unfortunate girl, as the
Cobras, the Pythons, and the Boss began to devour
her. "Trust in me !" exclaimed Edwin, suddenly
entering the glass-case.
Part LTI.—March Morality.
It was very seasonable weather. An easterly
wind blew everything into the middle of the fol-
lowing week, flares were at their maddest. Edwin
and Angelina (the story of whose escape from the
fangs of the Serpents, only exigencesof space prevent
us from unfolding) were walking down Piccadilly.
The young man entered a tobacconist's alone!
When he returned Angelina had gone! Seized
and abducted by Count Jacko de Bootzo, she
was reclining in a storm on board his yacht in the
Bay of Biscay. The frail bark began to sink!
Part IV.—April Amiability.
The Row was beginning to be fashionable. The
man with the chairs was demanding pennies.
Angelina (whose adventures after shipwreck
in the Bay of Biscay would well repay recital did
the exigences of space permit) was seated under
the fast blossoming trees listening to the Horse-
Guards' Band. "Let me tell you your fortune,
my pretty lady," said a ragged individual, be-
side her. But, in spite of his disguise, she
recognised him. "Edwin!" she exclaimed.
"My own darling!" Then she fainted. He
lifted her up gently into his arms, and vaulting
OUT! OR, PUNCH'S
with his fair burden into the empty saddle of a
runaway horse, hurriedly quitted the Park. The
infuriated steed dashed down Piccadilly.
Part V.—May Madness.
It was the Private View at the Royal Academy.
All London was there. A crowd had gathered
round Edwin as he attempted to lead his fair
lunatic from the Refreshment-room. "Ange-
lina." he whispered, "do you not recognise
me?" Her only answer was, with a wild laugh,
to attempt to stab him with a carving-knife. Then
she rushed into the Powder Magazine, near the
Serpentine, and seized a matchbox. The Sentry
fwho had not observed her entrance) stood aghast!
Her next movement was to light a match!
Part VI.—June Juries.
The Central Criminal Court was crowded. The
Counsel for the Crown had summed up the evidence
which substantiated the Prisoner's guilt. There
had been told, in detail, the whole ttory that would
have appeared in these columns had only space per-
mitted of the narration. The Judge hsd done his
duty dispassionately. Edwin and Angelina, sup-
porting one another in each other's arms, with pale
lips, colourless cheeks, and weary eyes, anxiously
awaited their doom. The Jury consulted; then
they retired to their own room. On their return,
in answer to the question, " Are you decided upon
your verdictf" the Foreman replied, "We are!"
Part VII.—July Jewellery.
It is to be regretted that space will not permit
of a recital of the escape of Edwin and Angelina
from Newgate and the condemned cell. They en-
gaged a yacht, and were cruising in the Mediter-
ranean. On account of the hurried manner in
which they had to collect a crew, their employes
were not of very good character. Perhaps the most
respectable of them was their mate, a Greek Pirate,
known as Kuthrotos. Following the plan given
them by the old Abbe, they soon discovered the
Island of Monte Carlo. Here, on entering the
cave, they found it filled with the most magnificent
diamonds. The next moment they heard a voice,
and felt the barrel of a revolver grazing their fore-
heads. "Move an inch, and I fire!" It was
Kuthrotos, the Greek Pirate.
Part VIII.—August Amusements,
Lucerne was crowded. The table (Th6te at
the Sweitzeroffhad never numbered so many guests.
The story of Edwin and Angelina's escape
from the pirates (which we are forced to suppress,
to make room for other articles) had constituted
them the hero and heroine of the locality. Edwin
and Angelina had ascended one of the loftiest
mountains in Switzerland, and from the summit
were admiring the delightful view. Suddenly
Edwin turned white. There was a slight tremble,
and then earth began to move. "Hold me firmly,
darling," whispered Edwin in Angelina's ear.
"We are going baok on an avalanche!" And he
told the truth!
Part IX.—September Splendour.
Count Jacko de Bootzo, who, it would have
been remembered, had taken a very active part in
the Servo-Bulgarian War, had we had space to re-
count his adventures, was once again in England.
He was mounting his horse to go out with his pack
of visiting cards, when a telegram was placed in his
hands. '"Pristi."' he exclaimed, beneath his
breath, and immediately returned to town. He
hastened to his magnificent chambers in St. James's
Street. All his papers had been taken! The will
was gone! For a momont he lost his reason. Then
he became more calm, and rowed his eight-oar (he
was thoroughly English in his tastes) to Scotland
Yard. "I was expecting to see you," said Inspector
Booker, of the Criminal Investigation Department,
with a smile. "I have traced the whole compli-
cated affair to a man and a woman. It is a long,
but deeply interesting story. Take a seat, and I
will tell it to you.'' Thus invited all eager to hear the
truth at last, the Count dropped into a chair. The
Inspector refreshed hismemory with a draught from
his note-book, and then began.

It was the Polling Day of the General Election.
Edwin and Angelina (whose extraordinary ad-
ventures Inspector Booker told the Court, in
confidence, and which we should have reported but
for the very small space devoted to fiction in these
columns) were, of course, the observed of all ob-
servers. After mutual explanations it is needless
to relate that they had become fast friends with
the last of the De Bootzo's. Consequently they
were deeply interested in his success. Naturalised
an Englishman, he had contested the county, or
rather, one of its divisions. "Mia Cara," he
murmured to Angelina, "the two o'clock train
will bring a thousand voters to vote against me."
"They shall never arrive!" exclaimed the lovely
and strong-minded girl. Then she entered the
signal-box and coquettishly chloroformed the
signal-man. The clock pointed to one minute
to two—in another sixty seconds the train (which
being on the 8outh-Eastem Railway was never a
moment behind time) would be due. With a
whirl the engine approached. Angelina turned
the points, with a white scared face. Suddenly
she fainted. On the engine she had recognised
Edwin, who, all unconscious of his danger, was
laughing heartily!
Part XI.—November Necromancy.
Edwin was inconsolable. After learning the
harrowing incidents that would have been related
in our last chapter had there been room for them,
it is obvious that he was forced to feel consider-
able apprehension as to the safety of Am. h.in a.
She was with the Greek Kalends in their own
mountains, a prisoner. "I will help you," ex-
claimed De Bootzo, and dragging him outside the
Crystal Palace, opened a secret door, discovered ten
llights of steps, passed through a stone passage, and
found themselves in a hall, where a Masonic Lodge
was being held. Edwin remembered the stories of
the Mysterious Brotherhood that had reached him
from time to time, in the shape rather of hints than
assertions. Now it was one of his friends who had
saved himself from scalping by North American
Indians by raising his right thumb; now it was
another who had been the constant guest at the
dining-table of the King of a third-rate Conti-
nental Power by merely jerking his left fore-finger.
He perfectly trembled with curiosity. "Before you
ore initiated," said the Worshipful Master, "I
will tell you all the secrets of our Craft." And
then he divulged all the secrets of Freemasonry,
in the following words.
Part XII.—December Delusions.
Christmas once more! The mistletoe and tht
holly! All good things in season. Bills coming
in by the dozen. Never was there so much doinj
at the dear old County Court! A monrnfully old-
fashioned Christmas! It need scarcely be hintec
that, after the many adventures our hero ant
heroine passed through since the first entertt
the Masonic I^odge. and the last fell among th>
Brigands (adventures that only the exigence
of Bpace prevent us from publishing at ful
length), that they were hspoy to meet again ii
the large Reception Room of Haunted Hall, Ghost
Bhire. They were holding high revel. All th
neighbours were invited for forty miles round fo
ten o'clock, when they were regaled with wea
tea, Abernethy biscuits, and quartered oranges
After a while EnwiN recited to them. The ho(
was in the middle of one of his most unsuccessfu
"humorous pieces." when midnight began to strik
on the old hall clock. Gradually the lights burne
blue, and went out. The guests shrieked, and som
of them fainted. There were many there wh
would have gladly listened to Edwin's recitation i
preference to this. A ghastly light, and tho Cour
de Bootzo glided into the room. Anoelin
shrieked, threw up her arms, and swooned. "Wh
do you come here?" asked Edwin, angrily, f<
he was annoyed at being interrupted. "I come,
replied the ghost of the Count, " to tell you all-
know everything." And then, having assisted tl
ladies an* Angelina to resume their seats, 1
began his narrative. And that narrative (as wi
be seen in due course) supplied all the tuissii
links of the present story.
(To be concluded next year.)

A CHRISTMAS CAROL
Being a few scattered staves, from a familiar Composition, rearranged
for performance, by a Distinguished Musical Amateur, during the
Holiday Season, at H-rw-rd-n.
State I.—Bendizzy's Ghost.
Scroogestone closed his door, and locked himself in. Thus secured
against interruption, he took off his oollar. It required a pood deal
ot taking off, that collar, and as a matter-of-fact, was taken off a
good deal. Then he put on his dressing-gown, his slippers, and his
night-cap, and sat down before the fire, to take his gruel. He had
much to take, and he determined to take it, like a man.
The fire-place was pared all round with tiles, designed to illustrate
history, sacred and profane. There were William the Conqueror,
and Joseph and his Brethren, there were Benjamin's Mess, and the
Plagues of Egypt, and Indian Empresses, and Dutoh subjeots;
hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts. Y«t, if each smooth tile
had been a blank at first, with power to shape some picture on its
surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would
have been a copy of old Bendizzy's head on every one.
"Humbug!" said Scroosestone. He heard a clanking noise, as of
a dragged chain, the sound of feet upon the stairs, coming straight to-
wards his door. "It's humbug, still!" he said, " I won't believe it."
His colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on
through the heavy door, and stood before him—Bendizzy's Ghost.
The same face—the very same. Bendizzy. with his frontal curl,
his ohin-tuft, his usual buck-like vesture, and varnished boots. The

chain he drew was clasped about his middle. It was" made [(for
Sceoooestone observed it closely) of despatoh-boxes and diplomatic
protocols, of blue-bookB and seoret agreements, of many keys of
quaint workmanship, Indian and otherwise.
Scroogestone was still inoredulous, and fought against his senses.
"How now I" said he. "What do you want with me?"
"Muoh I Many things have happened sinoe we met."
Bendizzy's voice, no doubt about it.
"Who are you?"
"In life I was your rival, Benjamin Dizzy."
"Can you—can you sit down?" asked Scroogestone, looking
doubtfully at him.
"Do you think that, like some of your living friends, I have lost
my seat?" ohuokled Bendizzy, depositing himself in a chair, as
though it were as easy as sitting on a Treasury Benoh.
"You don't believe in me," observed the Ghost.
"I don't," said Scroogestone. "Never did," he added, sotto voce.
"More's the pity," said the Ghost, overhearing him. "It might
have saved you some rare messes if you had."
"Humbug I I tell you—humbug!" cried Scroogestone. _
At this the Spirit raised a scornful cry, and shook its chain with a
dismal and depressing noise.
"Tou are lettered," said Scroogestone, trembling. "Tell me
why?"
"I wear the chain I forged in life," replied the Ghost. "Is its
pattern strange to you t Or would you know the weight and length
of the strong coil you bear yourself P It was full as heavy ana as
long'as'this five Christmas Eves ago. Tou have laboured on it sinoe.
It is a ponderous chain." Sceoooestone glanced about him |on the
floor. But he could seenothing. "Hear me!" cried the Ghost. "My
time is nearly gone."
"I will," said Scroogestone. "But don't be hard upon me.
Don't be flowery, Benjamin! Pray!"
"I have sat opposite to you, William, invisible, this many a-day."
It was not an agreeable idea. Scroogestone shivered, and wiped
the perspiration from his brow.
"That is no light part of my task," pursued the Ghost, with a
touch of his ancient irony. "I am here to-night to warn and advise
you."
"Thank 'ee," said Scroogestone, drilv.
"You will be haunted," resumed the Ghost, "by Three Spirits."
"I—I think, I'd rather not," said Scroogestone.
"Without their visits,".said the Ghost, "you will not'take my tips
to heart. Farewell, William!"
The apparition walked backward to the slowly opening window,
and floated out upon the bleak dark night.
Scroogestone followed to the window, desperate in his ouriosity.
He closed the window and examined the door by which the Ghost
had entered. It was double-locked. He tried to say "Humbug!"
but stopped at the first syllable.
• •••••
Stave II.—The First of the Three Spirits.
It was a strange figure—like a child in some things, like a stalwart
resolute man in others,
like time-worn, hair-
blanched age, in not a
few. This was not
its strangest quality.
The figure fluctuated
in its distinctness,
and shifted in its
shape, and vacillated
in its apparent pur-
pose, being now clear
as day, now shadowy
and vague as night,
now a head without a
body, now a body
without a head, now
vigorously advancing,
now swiftly retreating,
now aimlessly drift-
ing. And in the very-
wonder of this, it
would be itself again;
distinct and clear as
ever. From the
crown of its head,
however, there Bprung
a bright dear jet of
light, which was
doubtless the occasion
of its using, in its
duller moments, a
great extinguisher for a oap, whioh it now held under its arm.
"Who are you ?" Scroogestone demanded.
"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past."
"Long past ?" inquired Scroogestone.
"No. Your past."
**••*•
The Spirit carried him far and wide, and showed him many things.
A studious boy at a big School, a grave eloquent youth at a great
College, a singer of comic songs, the rising hope of one Party, the
ardent champion of another, the half-reluotant leader of a third. A
shifting panorama of roles long abandoned, of scenes half-forgotten.
A Senate charmed into delighted absorption by fancy-illuminated
finance, a multitude witched into eager enthusiasm by mellifluous
moonshine. And the scenes! Snow-spread wastes, a beleaguered
Citadel, an ill-led, ill-equipped, but ever victorious army. A sea of
rapt faces hotly applauding hotter denunciations of war and waste!
A battered town, a broken square, sand-wastes stained crimson with
unavailing blood! A belated expedition crawling up an anoient
stream 1 A lonely, heroic, vainly-expeotant figure, in a desert-city!
A shriek of treachery, a cry of despair, a wide-sounding wail of
bitter, bitter disappointment!
"I wish—I wish," Scroogestone muttered, putting his hand to
his eyes—" but it is too late now I

"Leave me! Take me back! Haunt me no longer!" cried
Scroogestone, struggling with the Spirit. Scroogestone observed
that its light was burning high and bright. He snatched the
extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its

"I am the Ghost of Christmas Present," said the Spirit. "Look

Scboogestone respectfully did so. It was a pleasant enough
spectacle. Broad, beaming, of substantial bulk—nothing vague or

vaporous about it. A jolly giant, with a bare chest, a blazing
torch, an empty scabbard, a big steaming bowl, a ruddy face, an
opulent pile of seasonable cheer.
"This is better," thought Scroooestone—" less shivery and
reproaohful; more genial and restful. Spirit," said he, submissively,
"conduct me where you will. I went forth last night on compulsion,
and I learnt a lesson which is working now. To-night, if you have
aught to teach me, let me profit by it.
Par they went, and much they saw—amongst toiling artisans in
smoky towns, and newly-enfranchised labourers in rural places;
things unexpected—startling, suggestive lessons, which Sckoom-
stone could not but ponder and lay to heart, with results which may
be visible anon. He saw visions of troubled Churches and perturbed
parsonages, speotres of furious squires and jubilant rustics, shadowy
pastures cropped by phantom cows, shifting crowds, cockney and
bucolic, driving in opposite directions, clamouring in conflicting
causes, exulting over rival victories. He beheld one trusted henoh-
man raising a speotral banner of revolt, another drifting like a wind-
driven mist in the direction of the enemy. Brooding over these,
Scroog eston e again remembered the prediction of old Bendizzy. He
looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not, but, lifting up his
eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming like a
misty shadow along the ground towards him.
• •••••
Stave IV.—The Last op the Spirits.
"I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?"
said Scroogestone.
The Spirit answered not, but pointed forward with its hand.
".You are about to show me the shadow of things which have not
happened, but whioh will happen"
If the lessons of the Past are not applied to the possibilities of
the dim and distant Future," interrupted the Spirit.
"Lead on!" said Sckoogestone. "Lead on! The night is
waning fast, and it is precious to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit 1"
• •••••
State V.—The End op It.
What t his Spirit showed him, and taught him, Scroosestone confided
only to the discreet bosom of his faithful friend, frank counsellor,
and wise warner, Mr. Punch. Save that it showed him dark danger
in the frozen North, possibilities of dread disaster in the sandy East,
confusion in the dusk-ikin'd South, wild disorder in the "moist an
melancholy" West: a nation falling to Chaos in the pursuit c
Chimsiras, a Kingdom shaken by weak surrender to daring dii
loyalty, a smirched honour, a splendid reputation sullied, and
noble mausoleum clouded by \ late-falling shades of shame, It
nothing be said here and now of the speotral fore-shadow
ings of the Last of the Spirits. But if you nad seen the twaii

William Scroogestone and Mr. Punch—as you may in the piotun

have concluded that the Three Spirits had not wholly wasted thei
labours, that the recollections of their friendly visitations lent a zes

and that Mr. Punch hoped the best from the influence of the warning
of Bendizzi's Ghost upon the future of William Scroogestohe.
PUGNACIOUS PENMEN.

Scholl the dramatist, and M. Labbuybbe a Communist journalist, als<

We are told that they manage things better in France,
But the journalists there lead each other a dance;
If one man " slates" another for what he has done,
It is pistols for two, and then coffee for one:
Or the small-sword's called in to decide which is right,
By a dig in the arm, that's the end of the fight.
How too funny 'twould be could we tell in our rhymes,
How the Telegraph boldly assaulted the Times,
When Arnold and Buckle fell out; how Frank Htll,
Of the stern Daily News, should try Mudford to kill,
Who holds rule o'er the Standard; or pink, in a pet,

'Twould be fun if a challenge were savagely hurled
'Gainst the owner of Truth by E. Yates of the World:
If Hutton and Townsend, that long-winded pair
Of Spectator renown, should fight Vanity Fair:
While fierce T. G. Bowles would his work have to'do
With Saturday Poixock and pistols for two.
We may write on opponents and call them hard names,
But we do not go in for these duelling games;
If an argument needs to be backed up by such
Foolish deeds, then be sure it's not worth overmuch:
Let the Frenchmen go out, and endeavour to pink
Brother journalists,—we fight with goose-quill and.ink.

ON UNIMPEACHABLE AUTHORITY.
To the recent authentio revelations afforded
by certain well-informed portions of the Press
as to Mr. Gladstone's attitude and policy
in regard to the Nationalist Party in Ireland,
the following may be added with confi-
dence :—
It is now no longer a secret that Mr. Pab-
nell and Mr. Gladstone have met. The
meeting whioh was not intended to come to
the knowledge of Lord Salts hub y, took place
in the woods near Harwarden, on Saturday
last; the Irish Leader attending for the pur-
pose disguised as the local postman, the late
Premier also donning a woodman's smock for
the purpose of escaping detection. A highly
satisfactory and friendly understanding has
been the result of the interview, and there
is now no doubt, but that Mr. Gladstone
will immediately on the very first opportunity
that presents itself, take office relying on the
support of the Parnellite Vote. The. measure
of concession he is disposed to make is ample,
and will more than cover the Nationalist de-
mands, a oiroumstanoe that has caused, his
Irish collaborateur the liveliest gratification.
Complete £ severance and disruption of all
National and Imperial ties, is to form the basis
of the arrangement. Perfect liberty of action
will be left with the Sister Parliament to deal
with1' vested land interests," and as it is calcu-
lated that this may lead to some protests from
a noisy minority dispossessed of their property,
a well armed and equipped Constabulary, able
to supply the plaoe of the removed Military,
will form a prominent feature in the new
scheme of Government.
In the event of England going to war with
anylEuropean'Power or Powers, a benevolent
neutrality is not necessarily to be imposed on
or expected from the Irish Republic, the con-
duot of. whioh will be guided by the oireum-
stanoes of the oase as they arise; bnt a foreign
army will not be allowed to use Irish soil as a
basis for its operations, without twenty-four
hours' notice of the fact being given by the
Republic to Her Majesty's Government. It
is calculated that this will provide for any
eventualities likely to occur. With regard to
minor provisions, it is satisfactory to learn
that, though immediately on the assembling
of the Irish Parliament for its first session, the
Authorities of Trinity College, Dublin, will
have to look out for themselves, Mr. Glad-
stone has stipulated that Lord Caknabvon
shall, either in disguise, or in any other con-
venient way that shall seem fit by the Repub-
lican Authorities, have a safe-conduoton board
the mail packet for Holyhead. Indeed, all that
the far-seeing prevision of a cautious and
circumspect Statesman can provide against
has been carefully thought out, and embodied
in the forthcoming agreement, the ratification
of whioh must be eagerly looked for by
earnest partisans on both sides of St. George's
Channel.

THE HUMANE "HOLBORN."
In the Advertisement of an old friend, the Holhorn Restaurant,
put forward everywhere, and with striking effect in the outer sheet
of Mr. Punch's Almanack, the Public is informed that this cele-
brated place of entertainment provides in its "beautiful dining
saloons the best- cuisine and the finest wines," and that the
"famous table d'hote (price three-and-sixpence) from 5"30 till
9 o'olock "—three hours and a half eating, at a shilling an hour, is
oheap enough, in all conscience—is "accompanied by a full Orchestra,
under a distinguished Conductor."
This announcement is most gratifying to charitably disposed and
sympathetic diners, who, while they are filling themselves with the
good cheer, will no longer be distressed by the thought that the
Musicians may be empty, hungry, and eagerly eyeing the feeders at
the different tables. No. The Advertisement distinctly says that
the dinners are accompanied by " a full Orohestra," and this infor-
mation is really consoling. ■■ The "full Orohestra" oan afford to
regard the empty guests as they arrive without one feeling of bitter-
ness or envy. The Orchestra is fall—they have dined; they have
—not to quote it profanely—"eaten and drunk, and risen up (i.e.,
mounted to the gallery above) to play," and they can contemplate
their fellow-men, whether wanting little or much below, with the
perfect equanimity engendered by a satisfactory meal and an excel-
lent digestion.
The Humane Proprietors of the " Holborn" must beware of allow-
ing their Orchestra to become too full, or, in spite of the efforts of the
"distinguished Condnotor," they may doze, and take a few bars' rest.
By the way, who is the distinguished, but in the advertisement
nameless, Conductor P Is he so distinguished, of such exalted rank,
that he conducts incognito, perhaps concealing his identity be-
hind a false nose, whiskers, and wig? Is it possible that the Dis-
tinguished Conductor can be a certain Royal D-ke, who is known as
unequalled, in his own way, on the violin, and who has more than
once, we believe, conducted a band? There is a Duke's room at
the Holborn. But we will 'not inquire too curiously. Suffice it for
us, and the public, that the Three-and-sixpenny Dinner is first-
olass, that the Orchestra is "full," and that the Conductor is "dis-
tinguished." By the way, the first tune that the Orchestra ought to
commence with when the eating begins, should invariably be,
"There 's some one in the house wid Diner. \
PROMISING.
The First Lord of the Admiralty has appointed a Committee " to
consider and report upon the arrangements which will be necessary
to carry into effect the details of the recommendations of Admiral
Graham's Committee upon Dockyard Expenditure ;" and, as far as
can be judged from the selected names, it promises to work well.
The presenoe of Mr. J. Weight, C.B., Engineer-in-Chief, is in itself
a guarantee that the Committee will not, in its decisions, go far
wrong, while that of Captain Chatfield argues well for the
thorough talking out of all the propositions that, in the course of
business, will come under its consideration. Mr. McHardt, Director of
Stores, moreover, is not likely to prove a soft in giving his opinion;
while Mr. Gordon Miller, Inspector of Dockyard Accounts, will,
in his capaoity of Secretary, be able, while watching which way the
wind blows, to eliminate superfluous chaff from his record of the
proceedings, and give all extraneous matter the Back. With such a
nucleus of workers, the Committee certainly starts with everything
in its favour.
A Good Opening.
The following appear3 in the Athenaum .—
WANTED, by an educated Young Man, aged 22, a PLACE. Can
Paint, and talk Buskineaque.—Address, &c.
This young man—he seems to be very young, but he will probably
get over this in time, and it is after all not .his fault—does not say
what sort of a place he wants. Nor does he say what he can paint.
Does he give his attention to houses, pictures, or park palings? Now
what place would be suitable for a young man who can "talk Rus-
kinesque." Eh? What? Why? Of course the very thing—he
ought to be valet to Mr. James Whistler. Let him apply at once,
and accompany the gifted Symphonist on his American tour.

tions." Which of them calls himself a Variorum Teacher P

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [Dec*™ 26, 1885.

LITTLE (?) MISS HOUSE OF COMMONS AND HER SURPRISE BOX OF CHRISTMAS TOYS.'
See " Times" List, Dec. Uth.
"'TIS MERRY IN HALL."
Mb. Vice-chancellor Punch has reoeived a paper which was,
he is informed, recently issued by the Authorities of Trinity College,
Dublin. Here it is:—
"Trinity College, Dublin.—Noticb.—Owing to the disorder which
has prevailed of late in the Dining-Hall during Commons, the following Rules
will, in future, be strictly enforced;—
"1. There shall be no cheering, beating of the tables, &c, when a Stranger
dines at Commons, or under any circumstances.
"2. There shall be perfect silence during Grace.
"3 No Student shall move from his table towards the door while the
Second Grace is being said, but shall remain standing at his place till the
Grace is ended.
"4. No Student shall walk over the Dinner-table.
115. There shall be no throwing of bread, either during or after Commons.
"The above Rules merely contain some of the first elements of the manners
of a Gentleman; and any violation of them, or any act unbecoming a Gentle-
man, will be severely dealt with. Thomas T. Ghat, Junior Dean.
"December 14, 1885."
As to No. 1. When a " distinguished stranger," \Mr. Punch,
for example, is a guest of the Templars, do not the Juniors, the well-
stuffed Gownsmen and the Students, also the Irish Stew-dents, oheer
vooiferously P Rather. Mr. Punch does not call to mind any beating
of tables, but he has a very grateful remembrance of the Table which
the Middle Templars keep—and it would be very hard to beat that.
As to Rule 2. Quite right. To hum,
would be irreverent and ungentlemanly.
of course, "while Graoe is being said," as, otherwise, the Chaplain,
or whoever officiates, himself would have to hold his tongue.
Rule 3. Quite right. Observe "Second Graoe "—not " Grace
after dinner." To make it classical and complete, there should be a
Third Grace. But what with these Graces in Hall, and the Graces
of the Senate, the Graduates and Undergraduates of Trinity can't be
oalled a Graceless set.
Rule 5. Of course not. The Undergraduates will show them-
selves thoroughly well-bred, and not make the Dons crusty.
The summing up is obviously correct. Mr. Yice-Chancellor
Punch hopes the Junior Dean will have no further trouble with the
Students who would bring down his Gray hairs with sorrow, &o.; in
whioh case Mr. V.-C. P. would have to compose a " Qray't Elegy,"
Be aisy, Boys, will ye now? And a Merry Christmas to all of you
that oan't get away, or who have, to quote Mrs. IUmsbotham's
Shakspeare, "to labour in their vacation."
a, whistle, talk, or sing,
"During Graoej" means,
Just in Time!
The United States Consul at Samoa reports, so said a'paragraph in
Saturday's Timet, that on the direct tack of the Californian Bteamers
a brand-new Island has risen quite unexpectedly out of the sea.
Let Mr. Pa knell at onoe annex it, take his friends out, with plenty
of provisions, and'eommence Home Rule on a small scale.
