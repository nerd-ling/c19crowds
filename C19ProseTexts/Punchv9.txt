A correspondentſ writes :-" On Tuesday," the 8th
inst., there passed away at Sudbury, Harrow, aged 80,
a water-colour artist who, some half century ago,
awoke one morning to find herself famous. Miss
SARAH SETCHEL, a name scarcely known to the
present generation, was the painter in 1842 of a picture
illustrating one of Crabbe’s ‘Tales of the Hall.”
The picture was entitled “The Momentous Ques-
tion.” At a private view of the Royal Academy or
of the Water-Colour Society’s Exhibition it attracted
the attention of the Prince Consort, who found him-
self anticipated in his desire to purchase , it by a
dealer. In 1843 it was placed in the hands of the
late Mr. Samuel Bellin, the eminent inezzotint
engraver, by whose labours it, obtained a wide-spread
popularity. It represents the interior of a cell,
where in are seated two figures—the prisoner, over-
whelmed with despair, and his betrothed, whose appeal-
ing words seem to add to the intensity of his anguish.
It is the genuine power and pathos of this little
picture that secured for it the appreciation" of the
public. The unexpected success which attended its
exhibition so seriously affected the health and sub-
sequently the sight of the artist, that she was unable
for a time to continue her artistic career. Under
these circumstances she seldom presented pictures for
exhibition, and but one other picture of hers became
well known to the public—" In Silk Attire –which
at once found a ready purchaser. Those pictures,
which were the work of her later years, attest the
fact that the gift which had been hers was not
destroyed, although the energy to use , it was, un-
fortunately, in a great measure gone from her for
ever.’’

WE have every hope that the New Year—christened by Godfather TIME, Eighteen Hundred and Forty-Six—
is a fine, brawny fellow; a young HERCULEs, for, in truth, as matters loom about us, he will have HERCULEs’
work to do. He comes in just to catch a glimpse of “the departing skirts” of SIR Robert, and to look upon the
hopeful face of Little John. He comes in to see the last fight of the ogre Corn Law—the Sawney Bean that
hath eaten up men, women, and little children—“grinding their bones to make his bread.” He comes in to see
the last fight of the Giant (who hath Dukes and Lords for bottle-holders)—to see him beaten,
N / laid low, killed in the House of Parliament; whilst HER GRAcious MAJESTY, with Aurorean
smile, shall with her silver voice pronounce—Je le veur ! A tremendous privilege, this,
for a New Year !
And now the New Year has a dejected look; for he hears the voices of millions
bewailing the potato blight. He listens, too, to many tongues discoursing learnedly of
hopeful remedies: the words “starch”—“gluten”—“albumen”—“woody fibre,”—ring in
his infant ears, and he knows not what to
make of them. Then is he astounded to see
A certain small heads lost in large coronets;
and to hear one head avow that the blight is
no blight at all, but merely a popular preju-
dice—whilst another head discourses learn-
edly, benevolently, of support and comfort,
showing to the English labourer how he,

iy PREFACE.
Hodge and family, may, to avoid the pinch of famine, just take a pinch of powder of curry. “Potatoes have
failed in England”—cries the head—“but, is there not balm in Gilead, doth not India send her spices !”
Should our ploughmen at any time lack the luxury of onions, is it not a consoling matter to know that they
may, instead, eat nutmegs?—for are not nutmegs “comfortable to the stomach?”
But the New Year—delegating Punch as spokesman— gives other counsel. Royal CAMBRIDGE saith there
is no potato blight; then let His Royal Highness—taking counsel with kindred philanthropists—prove the
value of his golden syllables! The hardness of the times needs great examples of beneficence and goodness.
And, therefore, in our mind's eye, do we already behold the agents of Royal CAMBRidge taking ship for
Portugal—where RICHMOND says good potatoes most do congregate—to freight a hundred argosies with
the million's daily food. Let NoFFolk think not to curry the bowels of the poor—to “rack their sides with
pinches” of oriental powder—but let him and all of his order band together to BLIGHT THE BLIGHT ; and
this they may do, not with “lime” and “pounded charcoal,” as professors learnedly do counsel,-but with
gold-dust; nothing but gold-dust . We beg pardon: a few layers of Bank-notes will do just as well.
It is well—it is admirable—for professors to lecture. Musical is the voice of BUCKLAND–dulcet and wise
the discourse of PLAYFAIR. But the New Year needs lectures of another sort: it calls to all to assist Royal
CAMBRIDGE in his proof that the potato blight is a wicked flam; and this they can do, by a few magical words,
written on Bank cheques.
Such is the advice of Punch. Let all, according to their means, combine—and it will be a fine thing for Old
Eighteen Forty Six to say, when, hoary and worn out, he passes from this world to his fellows in Eternity—
“My Brethren, CAMBRIDGE spoke the words of truth. In my time the Poor felt no Potato Blight !”
And so, Readers, though the fight of Eighteen Forty Six may be tough and hot, let us begin it—as CoND£
once opened the trenches—with nothing harsher than pleasant music. But let ours be the world's music—music
that should circle the earth with divinest melody—music that is the enduring hopeful soul, dwelling in the old, old
syllables—

..º-
R. ROEBUCK has, at least, done one good thing. He has
caused a great fall in the price of duelling-pistols. In a few
years, and such social instruments will be only so much old iron.
Hair-triggers, at least a few samples, will be preserved by the
MEYRicks and other virtuosi among the weapons of a by-gone time
—of an extinct age of barbarism. They will take their place with
the scalping knife of the Red Man. A few nights since Ma. Roe-
Buck, in his place in the House of Commons, flung some hard words
at the Irish Repeal Members and their Great Cham, O'Conn ELL.
There are few who can deny the truth of the assertions of the
Member, for Bath : but then, it is said, truth is not to be spattered
about in the material of dirt. The Irish Repeal Members—the
mild “sucking-doves” of Conciliation Hall—the orators, who when
speaking of the Saxon, link nameless phrases together-pretty and
innocent as chains of daisies made by children—these, the sensitive
and soft-spoken, when truth is to be dealt out upon them, would
have it very mild and sweet, indeed . They would invoke Truth,
as the Poet invokes spring :
“Weiled in a shower of roses, soft, descend!”
And when truth comes not in such odoriferous stream, but in a shower
of mud—the sufferers, on the instant, shout for gunpowder to sweeten
them from what they call the pollution. An Irish Repealer may
deal in the syllables “miscreant”—“liar”—“coward”—“renegade”
—“traitor;” no word can be too dirty for his tongue when assailing
the Saxon : when, however, comes the turn of the Saxon to reply, he
must respond after Carnival-fashion; with nothing harder than
sugar-plums. A sweep attacks you with handfuls of soot from a bag
that seems inexhaustible, and you are not to take the fellow by the
collar, and shake him into some sense of decency: no, you are to
fling nothing at him more offensive than egg-shells filled with rose-
water. If you do, his honour is hit ; his ermine-skinned reputation
is stained, and—“blood and wounds !”—he roars for pistols 1
MR. Roebuck thus denounced the Repeal worshippers of O'Cox-
NELL :—“Those who follow such a leader deserve little respect either
for their position or their intellect.” Whereupon, the gunpowder
Memberfor Sligo, Mr. Somers, writesanote to Mr. Roebuck asking—
“Are you prepared to justify these words (These words are underlined.)? The mean-
ing of the words I have underlined I am sure you are too well read in the old histories
of whivalry to misinterpret.”
Ha, MR. SomeRs 1 the days of such chivalry, if not gone, are fast
going : for MR. Roebuck—vulgar man —does not submit himself
to the chance of being killed for speaking a hard, unpalatable verity,
but calls up the letter-writer before the House for breach of privi-
†ºunt of fje
THE
lege, and is praised and patted on the back by the Prime Minister
and others for his true courage. Whereupon, MR. SomeRs does not
offer a pistol at MR. Roebuck, but an apology; a wiser and a better
thing.
It has been urged, that since MR. Roebuck will not fight, he
ought not, by his abusive powers, to render himself obnoxious to
a challenge. MR. Roebuck is no general favourite of ours. He is
too “splenetic and rash”—besides being a little too much tainted
with the conceit that he was sent into the world as the world's sole
Mentor. We do not always approve of MR. Roebuck's language:
certainly, were we to select an epithet for him, we should not borrow
that applied to Homer; no, we should not call him “the golden-
mouthed” Roebuck. But this defect, we submit, is the greatest
argument against the sheer folly, the inexpressible stupidity of
duelling. We will suppose Mr. Roebuck to possess ten times his
present amount of vituperation : we will imagine him to be worthy
the envy of even O'Conn ELL himself: we will think the member
for Bath a sort of human cuttle-fish, blackening, when he lists, all
around him. Well, had he even Irish charity to defend his bad
words by a worse weapon, the pistol—would not the man he had
recklessly, most unjustly abused, be a fool—even though a fool “of
honour,” still a fool—to give his libeller the chance of shooting him
he had outraged 1 Thank heaven the opinion of the world is fast
becoming a surer test of a man's honour, than hair-triggers.
At the moment we write, there lies another victim to the stupidity
of “gentlemanlike satisfaction.” Another duellist lies in “his
bloody shroud.” From the evidence of Mas. HawkEy, on the
inquest, we come at a strange code of honour recognised in the
Army. She states that the victim, Ma. SEton, followed her with
dishonourable importunities; in the course of which he observed-
“Whatever your husband says to me, I shall not go out with him; it is impossible
for a cavalry man to mix himself up with an infantry man.”
Thus, an adulterer—a scoundrel of any dye—according to this
precious code, is not to give what he himself considers gentlemanly
satisfaction, if he, the villain, be a “cavalry man.” He is to be
saved from punishment by his horse. The argument is unworthy of
the intelligence even of the quadruped 1
The last few days have done mortal harm to the principle of
“gentlemanly satisfaction.” Potentates have in their time caused
“Ultima ratio regum” to be inscribed on their murderous cannon. The
“last argument of kings 1” In like manner public opinion is fast
tracing on the duelling-pistol—Ultima ratio stultorum t The last
argument of fools I

Côt 330ttip of the 33ail. º
Now that the Railways have absorbed every other interest, it is quite
impossible that the poetry of the country can any longer hold itself aloof
from its all-pervading influence. “The Soldier's Tear,” or the “Sailor's
Snivel,” will become obsolete and rococo. Instead of holding aloft snow-
white scarfs to flutter in the breeze, we shall have railway signals hoisted
by impassioned stokers or ardent engine-drivers, as they pass the cottage-
doors of their mistresses at eighty miles an hour, by a special train.
We beg leave to call the attention of our poets, and particularly that
of the Poet BuNN, to the new field for imagination which the Railways
open to them. Fair girls “met in a crowd,” or standing amid glittering
throngs, are completely used up, and nothing now remains but the
sentiment of the rail; the great trunk-lines being exactly the sort of line
that such minds as the Poet BUNN are calculated to adorn and illustrate.
We give a specimen of what we think might be done with such a
subject as-
|-|-
Jº — *-i-
THE STOKER'S SIGH.
The RE was a fair and beauteous girl,
She lov’d a stoker brave,
And of her hair a glossy curl,
That girl that stoker gave.
He press'd one hand upon his heart,
The other to his eye;
And knowing they were doomed to part,
--- That stoker heav'd a sigh.
Before the lattice open wide,
Behold that stoker stand,
He cries “Wilt be a stoker's bride,
Wilt take a stoker's hand?”
The words had scarcely left his tongue,
Erepealing loudly by,
The Railway starting-bell is rung,
The stoker heaves a sigh.
- - -
--------
-
“Ah, dearest once I us’d to dream—”
His voice was heard no more, - -
The whistle gives its frantic scream, -
The engine gives a roar.
The stoker hurries to the train,
They're off! away they fly;
He heaves the coals, for 'twould be vain.
Just now to heave a sigh.
PEERs of PEN AND INK.
SIR. Robert PEEL is a modest man; all Prime Ministers are ; it is the
weakness of their station. Nevertheless, SIR. Robert is an especial
victim to the official diffidence. He complains that HER MAJEsty has
allowed Her by Her faithful Commons only £1,200 a year—half-a-
handful of crumbs from the State table—for the literary and scientific
Lazaruses in their feebleness and old age:E1,200 a year, a sum which,
no doubt, in its insignificance is conducive of much distress to the
royal mind,-and yet, SIR. Robert PEEL will not ask Parliament for an
additional grant. If a young Princess is to be married, that she may
enrich a pauper prince of royal German blood, Sir Robert puts on the
face of an unabashed mendicant, and boldly asks for thousands per
annum. He asks, and has. He can speak out for a PRINCEss Augusta of
CAMBRIDGE, but MINERVA herself might wither in a garret, with the regret
of the Minister that HER Majesty had “only £1,200 a year” for every
branch of knowledge. Wherefore, then, does not SIR. Robert pluck up
his courage, and ask for an additional thousand or two in the name of the
humanities :
But literary and scientific men need not alms: they want no pensions.
What they demand, and what sooner or later they will have, is a just
recognition of their great claims on the consideration and gratitude of
government. When a man of literary genius dies—a man who has
enriched the world with immortal thoughts—with wealth imperish-
able—it is thought a mighty piece of benevolence on the part of a Minis-
ter if he bestows some fifty pounds on the dead man's family. Foolish,
superficial folks, cry “what magnanimity " Yes; this is deemed on
the part of a Minister a humane and graceful mode of acknowledging the
claims of genius. France, Prussia, and America, might teach us better.
They invest their literary man with state distinction: they clothe him
with office, as the noblest representative of national greatness. In Eng-
land, the literary man is a creature disowned by the State ; never per-
mitted to come within the doors of the Palace, lest, we presume, the foot-
men should catch literature as children catch measles. He is considered
by the English aristocracy as a clever kind of vagabond—a better sort of
RAMo Samee, to amuse-by-books, instead of knives and balls. Had
| Washington IRVING been born an Englishman, he had never, even as a
| diner-out, seen the inside of St. James's,
|therefore, is he Ambassador at Madrid. What a wide, a monstrous look
He is an American author, and,
of contempt would aristocracy put on if it were proposed to send Charles
Dickens, Esq. as Ambassador to Florence 1 How would the London-
DERRys have stared if the late Thomas Hood had been gazetted Minister
Plenipotentiary at Washington 1 Hood himself—it would have been
thought-had never written anything so droll But Hood dies in penury,
and it is a fine thing—a gracious act—for the English Prime Minister to
bestow fifty pounds upon those the man of genius leaves behind English
Ministers can only play the MæcENAs over a man's coffin. Why do they
not reward him with dignified employment when alive?
Having alluded to Hood, we may here express our delight that the
subscription set a-foot for those who were dear to him, has been nobly
contributed to by Manchester. The stout-hearted men of Birmingham
and other places, will, of course, follow the goodly example,
THE CITY GRAND JUNCTION TURTLE AND GENERAL soup
company.
We have seen the prospectus of a new Company that will shortly be
started in the City, under the patronage of the Common Council. The
Company proposes to lay down pipes for supplying soup from Birch's to
Guildhall and the principal chambers and counting-houses of the me-
tropolis. The terms, which are rated very low, will be so much a quarter,
and persons will call to collect the “soup-rate” as regularly as they do
the water-rate. The only difficulty will be in deciding upon the par-
ticular soup that is to be laid on in each street; but this has been already
obviated in many thoroughfares by several houses accommodatingly
having the same taste : for instance, amongst the Aldermen the una-
nimity for turtle was found to be wonderful. Prospectuses will be issued
in a few days with maps of the city, through which this projected
line and its different branches will pass; and shares can be obtained
3. applying at the Terminus of the Company, the back-kitchen, BIRch's,
sports above STAIRs.
THE Liverpool Mercury says, “A cricket-match, between the Preston
and Manchester Clubs, is on the tapis.” This is the first time we have
ever heard of a drawing-room being the best field for a cricket-match. We
should like amazingly to have seen this match played on the tapis. We
suppose the runs took place between the fireplace and the door, the
wickets being made of the tongs and poker at one end, and umbrellas and
walking-sticks at the other. The scouts, of course, were looking.out on
the balcony to catch the ball, if it came through the window.

THE Ascot cu P DAY.
* WHY ARE You on THE chossing, JAMEs P Is Your Fathrm Hill P
“No. He's DRove Mothek Down to HAscot.
STIGGINS IN NEW ZEALAND.
In the galleries of the Jesuit College of Rome hang a series of portraits,
villanously painted for the most part, of defunct brothers of that Society.
Round the foreheads of every tenth man or so, you see painted a little
circle of vermilion—not by way of ornament, for it is an ugly head-dress,
but to signify that the person so decorated has met with death, in the
pursuit of his missionary labours among the Heathen.
At the Propaganda, where they teach, preach, and sing, in every lan-
guage in the world, young men are pointed out to you, who in addition to
the black dress, have a little red cord, which means that they are doomed
to death. They go to China, take the native habit and dress, preach there
until discovered, and die as hundreds of their brethren have done before
them. These are the men whose abominable artifices and superstitions
are constantly attacked in Exeter Hall.
This line of martyrdom is by no means the line of our missionary
Fathers—Fathers, indeed, and with large families too; but though they
labour more comfortably, they perform many wondrous things.
We suggest, that against next May meeting (there will be plenty of
time) MR. DANDEson CoATEs, the Secretary of the British Propaganda,
should get up a picture-gallery for the edification of the good souls who
come up to subscribe to the missions, and pay and console our martyrs
before they go forth to their work.
In New Zealand, for instance, let us have pictures of their sufferings,
persecutions, and the miracles they have performed—yes, miracles.
There was FATHER KENDAL: MR. Bullen tells us, in his speech, that he
purchased forty square miles of land with thirty-six aires. Was not this
working wonders ? This martyr should be painted with an axe in the
corner of the picture, as BARTHoLoMEw is with a gridiron, or CATHARINE
with a wheel.
FATHER WILLIAMs, that Converter of the Heathen, should have a fine
canvass dedicated to himself and his large family. “He got 11,000 acres
of land out of the natives,” MR. BULLER says—and DANDEson Coates
declares this is what every family missionary ought to do.
FATHER Taylor got 50,000 acres. FAIRBURN got 40,000 (DANDEson
says they are going to give it back again—a subject for another picture).
Another little army of twenty-three martyrs put in their claim for
186,000 acres. Let all their portraits be painted, and hung up in
Lincoln's Inn Fields for the encouragement of other missionaries, and to
induce the public to give more money to poor fellows who can't cultivate
their land without capital.
These proud achievements belong to the Church alone. The Roman
Catholics in New Zealand have not asked or taken an acre. There is
only one little job among the Wesleyans; and what was the consequence 1
The man who executed it was disowned, and immediately excluded from
that unworthy and sectarian body. Let us trust he has found refuge in
DANDEson's pale.
MR. JERNINGHAM WAKEFIELD tells us in his book, that the admirable
Fathers (bless them for their benevolence and Christian good-will 1) have
taught the natives not to put their trust in any man of the world, or to
bargain with the European traders who might cheat them, as the Fathers
never do ; and they call all the non-missionary colonists Devils. Devils
of course—and what is the duty of their reverences ! Why, to cast out
the devils to be sure, and to keep the natives from all danger.
THE FLEET STREET RACES.
A vehy animated race took place last Tuesday at this celebrated meet-
ing. The City Tollman and the Butcher-boy started precisely at three
from the corner of Chancery Lane, and went off in beautiful style, the
Butcher-boy taking the lead, though he carried many pounds extra-weight,
and maintaining it as far as St. Dunstan's Church. Opposite Serjeant's
Inn, he was full two wheels a-head of the City Tollman, but when they
neared Bouverie Street, the City Tollman picked up a bit, owing to the
badness of the ground, and was gaining rapidly upon the Butcher-boy,
when the latter, by dexterously applying the whip, shot by his adversary,
and completely distanced him. He would certainly have won the race,
in glorious style, if a Patent Safety driver, who was quietly exercising
his horse up and down the middle of the course, had not cut in
| before him, and nearly thrown him from his seat. As it was, the Butcher-
| boy protested against the City Tollman pocketing the stakes. The winner
was not claimed. We feel bound to state, before concluding our report of
this well-contested race, that the police regulations all along the line were
shamefully deficient, and that the grand stand was occupied as usual by
the same number of unhired cabs.

GREAT MEETING OF CATS 1
ſº ºr
Kiſ
* * * *
or many nights ago, a large and very respectable
meeting of cats was held on the tiles of the House
of Commons, for the purpose of petitioning the
members beneath them, for an act of protection
similar to that one in the House for the safety of
dogs. MR. FINEwhiskER was unanimously called
to the chimney-pot; and proceeded to open the
business of the night. The idea of the meeting
was wholly due to MR. HUME, who had asked with
a sneer why, if dogs were to be protected, cats should
not be also made property by law He (the Chairman) would also put that
question, though not in the spirit of the hon. member, in whose teeth he
indignantly flung back the sneer. (Loud mewing.) The fact was, they
would never be safe, until they were made game of. He asked, why
should not cats be placed on an equal footing with hares? (Reiterated
mewing.) He saw very little difference between 'em. In fact, they
had been known on a pinch to do the duty of hares, and why should
they not be equally protected He thought that Mr. GRANTLEY BERKE-
LEY—for that true-hearted sportsman would make game of anything-
should be entrusted with their petition.
MRs. CREAMLAP next addressed the meeting—but in so low a voice
that she was sometimes almost inaudible. However, we understood her
to say, that the wrongs of cats were past belief. - No creature suffered
more from the tyranny of political economists... Even housemaids were
bitten with the notion of superabundant population, and drowned kittens
by fives and sixes. She herself had only a fortnight since lost four little
ones—all of 'em soused in a pail. (Sensation.) She had, perhaps, no
more right to complain than any other cat, but she begged to know—
and perhaps Sir JAMEs GRAHAM would answer the question—why the
same principle wasn't carried out with babies at the Unions?
MR. MouseR said it was an undeniable fact that certain Jews—(Cries of
“order”)—he begged pardon—gentlemen of the Hebrew persuasion abso-
lutely traded in the skins of cats. They were flayed—it had been proved-
alive to meet a demand for caps. No one present was certain that he
should return home with his fur on his back He asked, was this a state of
things to be continued 1 (Cries of “No!"). It had been said that cats were
of no value. He would not trespass on the meeting by any allusion to
the cat of WHITTINGTON.—neither would he speak of the famous Tortoise-
shell Tom-cat, whose memory was embalmed in comic song ; but he
would ask, if greyhounds were to be guarded by the law—he would ask
why mousers should be unprotected (Loud mewing.)
Certain resolutions were then passed, and a petition drawn up; and it
was further agreed that MR. GRANTLEY BERKELEY should be solicited to
advocate feline interests. The Chairman, in returning thanks, produced a
great effect by a beautiful quotation, beginning—
- “Hereditary tabbies, know ye not—”
We regret that the rest escaped us.

This gathering took place, as usual, at Apsley House, on the 18th—the

this occasion for 76.” This is a mistake; and as we shall subsequently
show, a very important mistake. The number was 77 .
All the arrangements were the same as those observed for a succession
of years. There was the same gorgeous display of plate—there was the
Wellington Shield in all its massive beauty and effulgence 1

sagacious way, in which his Royal Highness, in another picture, held his

He would confidently refer the company to the window of MR. ColNaghi
to bear him out. His Grace concluded by proposing—“Health to the

His Royal Highness replied to the toast. It was not for him, in the

stood for—the number escaped us, but we think his Royal Highness said
five hundred-military portraits of himself (Cheers). He was as ready
to stand and sit for as many more 1 (Renewed cheers.) He hoped—in the
flattering words of the distinguished Duke—he hoped yet to lead the van
of the picture shops, as a Colonel of French Cuirassiers—as a Chief of the
Cossacks—as an Officer of the Chapelgorris—as, in fact, an officer of any
and every military force whatever ! (Enthusiastic cheers.) He might also
be allowed to state that he had made a new hat for a part of the army—
(Sensation)—a hat that took away something from the hitherto inflexible
sternness of the infantry, and gave to the wearer a certain air of low
comedy - if he might use the expression—that, as he was credibly
informed, had had a slaughtering effect on the Park nursery-maids
(Laughter). He had also—though it pained him to speak of his military
achievements—he had also invented a new uniform for his regiment. He
had clothed His Own in cherry-coloured trousers; thereby expressing a
significant hint to all the universe that he and his corps were ready to
shed their blood for the defence of their country (Loud cheers). His
Royal Highness in conclusion gave “The health of the Duke of WEL-
LINGTON.—the laurel-crowned WELLINGTON 1"
The Noble and Gallant Host—amid enthusiastic cheering—rose. He
said, the recurrence of that day brought him great pleasure, though not
unmingled with pain. Looking around that board, he could not but feel

that many who were last year present—many who had shared the storm.
of battle with him—were now nomore. He would, however, not dwell upon
the theme. His Royal Highness had been pleased to speak of his (the
Duke's) laurels. He could not deny the possession of them ; but whilst
he did not underrate their value, it was his earnest prayer that the world
would never again behold such a wreath; purchased with so much misery,
so much anguish to the great family of man. In every leaf of the soldier's
laurel were blood and tears. He had seen a great deal of the horrors of
conquest, and it was his prayer that this country, at least, would for ever
be spared a renewal of the misery. In a word, he trusted that War had
had its day. (The Noble Duke, after a short pause, then continued.)
| His friends might be surprised to see among them Private (the
| name and the regiment escaped us, but his Grace pointed smilingly to a
private soldier at the bottom of the table). They would perceive that he
was an old man—that he wore the Waterloo medal. He (his Grace)
had thought that as the chiefs of Waterloo were every year thinned by
death—he had thought, he said, that it would be honourable to them-
selves, that it would be pleasing to the Army at large, to see at least
one private soldier at that table—one private veteran, who had distin-
|guished himself at Waterloo-so that whilst º paid due honour to
|humble worth in the person of an individual, they themselves might
not for a moment forget that it was to the bone and muscle and in-
domitable courage of the masses of the British empire that the victory—
under Providence—was to be ascribed. The Noble Duke then gave
“The health of Private (again the name escaped us; so let us call
him Private Seventy-Seven), and the common soldiers who fought at
Waterloo !” (Drunk with cheers.)
Band,—“A man's a man for a’ that.”
Private Seventy-Seven rose, made the military salute, tossed off his
glass, and with swimming eyes and a voice touched with emotion, cried,
“God bless you, gentlemen, thank’ee l’”
The simple eloquence of the man had a marked effect upon the veteran
chiefs, who were evidently as much surprised as delighted by the unex-
- i. invitation of Private Seventy-Seven by the Hero of a Hundred
ights.
The meeting separated at an early hour.
We have now, as faithful chroniclers of events, merely to observe,
that we trust our contemporaries will in future give a more authentic
account of the Waterloo Banquet. Not that we feel quite satisfied with
ourselves that we have not obtained the name of the humble guest of the
| Eighteenth; and hereupon offer as a reward the Eight Volumes of Punch
| to any one who will favour us with the true name of the private soldier
whom, in our need, we have been compelled to distinguish as Private
Seventy-Seven :
THE NATIONAL Dr.AMA.
Some wicked wag last week wrote over the portico of Drury Lane, just
under the statue of Shakspeak, “This is the ORIGINAL BUNN House.”

BROUGHAM'S HAND-BOOK FOR POLITICAL, BOXING,
The art of Political Boxing is one in the cultivation of which I
have spent the best and most valuable part of my life, and I wil-
lingly give the world the benefit of my experience.
I am, by the by, prepared to take pupils, and specimens of my
style may be seen almost every evening in full operation in the
House of Lords. My favourite pupil Roebuck, known as the Bath
Slasher, attends nightly for the same purpose in the House of
Commons. -.
In hitting a blow at your adversary, be sure that you are quite
ready to get away. My pupil Roebuck is a perfect master of this
fine manoeuvre. He hits out very fiercely, and gets clear off just as
his opponent is preparing to retaliate.
Getting the nob into Chancery is a very fine achievement. I once
got several nobs into Chancery, and I certainly gave several of them
severe punishment...This Chancery manoeuvre has been a capital
thing for me, as I still enjoy a pension on account of it.
Throwing is a good trick in political boxing. I have been thrown
once or twice myself; I struggled for the fall, but down I went,
though I contrived to punish my adversary pretty well afterwards.
In my political sparring I find it capital exercise to be always at
it, and I think it a good plan to be constantly hitting out right and
left at something and somebody. It is not a bad notion to spar with
one's own servant, which I often do for exercise.
I may furnish a few more rules hereafter, if the above should be
approved and are likely to be acted on.

MR. CAUDLE HAs Not ACTED “Like A HUSBAND"
At The WEDDING DinneR.
* “AH me ! It's no use wishing—none at all : but I do wish that
yesterday fourteen years could come back again. Little did I
think, Ma. CAUDLE, when you brought me home from church, your
lawful wedded wife—little, I say, did I think that I should keep my
wedding-dinner in the manner I have done to-day. Fourteen years
ago | Yes, I see you now in your blue coat with bright buttons, and
your white watered-satin waistcoat, and a moss rose-bud in your
button-hole, which you said was like me. What? You never talked
such nonsense? Ha! MR. CAUDLE, you don't know what you talked
that day—but I do. Yes; and you then sat at the table as if your
face, as I may say, was buttered with happiness, and—What? No,
MR. CAUDLE, don't say that ; I have not wiped the butter off—not
I. If you above all men are not happy, you ought to be, gracious
knows :
“Yes, I will talk of fourteen years ago. Ha! you sat beside me
then, and picked out all sorts of nice things for me. You’d have
given me pearls and diamonds to eat if I could have swallowed 'em.
Yes, I say, you sat beside me, and—What do you talk about ! You
couldn't sit beside me to-day? That's nothing at all to do with it. But
it's so like you. ... I can't speak but you fly off to something else.
Ha! and when the health of the young couple was drunk, what a
speech you made then I It was delicious ! How you made every-
body cry, as if their hearts were breaking; and I recollect it as if it
was yesterday, how the tears ran down dear father's nose, and how
dear mother nearly went into a fit Dear souls! They littie thought,
with all your fine talk, how you'd use me! How have you used ºne?
Oh, Mn. CAUDLE, how can you ask that question It’s well for you
I can’t see you blush. How have you used me !
“Well, that the same tongue could make a speech like that, and
then talk as it did to-day ! How did you talk Why, shamefully.
What did you say about your wedded happiness Why, nothing.
What did you say about your wife Worse than nothing: just as if
she was a bargain you were sorry for, but were obliged to make the
best of What do you say tº And bad's the best ? If you say that
again, CAUDLE, I'll rise from my bed. You didn't say it? What,
then, did you say? Something very like it, I know. Yes, a pretty
speech of thanks for a husband . And everybody could see that you
didn't care a pin for me; and that’s why you had 'em here: that's
why you invited 'em, to insult me to their faces. What 1 I made
you invite 'em 2 Oh, CAUDLE, what an aggravating man you are 1
“I suppose you’ll say next I made you invite Miss PRETTYMAN ?
Oh yes; don't tell me that her brother brought her without your
knowing it. What? Didn't I hear him say so? Of course I did ; but
do you suppose I’m quite a fool! Do you think I don’t know that
that was all settled between you? And she must be a nice person
to come unasked to a woman's house? But I know why she came.
Oh yes; she came to look about her. What do I mean 2 Oh, the
meaning's plain enough. She came to see how she should like the
rooms—how she should like my seat at the fire-place; how she—
and if it isn't enough to break a mother's heart to be treated so l–
how she should like my dear children.
“Now, it's no use your bouncing about at-but of course that's
it; I can’t mention Miss PRETTYMAN, but you fling about as if you
were in a fit. Of course that shows there's something in it. Other-
wise, why should you disturb yourself Do you think I didn’t see
her looking at the cyphers on the spoons as if she already saw
mine scratched out and hers there? No, I shan’t drive you mad,
MR. CAUDLE ; and if I do it’s your own fault. No other man would
treat the wife of his bosom in—what do you say? You might as
well have married a hedgehog? Well, now it’s come to something !
But it’s always the case I Whenever you’ve seen that Miss PRET-

saw you laugh when you put it on her plate 1 And you don't sup-

table? No, I should hope I have more spirit than that. Yes; and
you took wine with her four times. What do you say? Only twice f
Oh, you were so lost—fascinated, MR. CAUDLE ; yes, fascinated—
that you didn't know what you did. However, I do think while I’m
alive I might be treated with respect at my own table. I say, while
I'm alive; for I know I shan’t last long, and then Miss PRETTY-

always finding fault yourself, but you must bring women home to
sneer at me at my own table. What do you say? She didn't turn up
her nose ? I know she did ; not but what it's needless—Providence
has turned it up quite enough for her already. And she must give
herself airs over my custards ! Oh, I saw her mincing with the

didn't even so much as bring one of your children into your speech.

me mad. Everybody says so.

Punch's GUIDE TO, SERVANTS.
PRELIMINARY CHAPTER.
ETTY, “first catch your fish”
is a golden rule for a
cook, and first catch
your situation is a very
necessary piece of advice
to be given to servants
in general. The choice
of a mistress requires as
much judgment as the
choice of poultry; and
you should be careful
not to pick out a very
old bird in either case.
The best market to go to
in order to suit yourself
is a servant's bazaar—
as it is called—where
mistresses are always
on view for servants to
select from. On being
§ shown up to a lady, you
should always act and
talk as if you were hir-
ing her, instead of want-
ing to be hired. You
should examine her
closely as to the com-
pany she keeps, and the
number of her family;
when, if there is any insuperable objection—such as the absence of
a footman, a stipulation against Fº a total prohibition of a
ase-pot, or a denial of the right of visit, by arefusal to allow followers—
in either or all of these cases, it will be as well to tell “the lady” plainly
that you must decline her situation. It is a good general rule to be the
first to give a refusal, and, when you find you are not likely to suit the
place, a bold assertion that the place will not suit you, prevents any com-
promise of your dignity. If you like the appearance and manner
of the party requiring your assistance, but with some few con-
cessions to be made, the best way to obtain them will be by declaring
that you never heard of any “lady” requiring—whatever it may be that
you have set your face against. By laying a stress on the word “lady,”
you show your knowledge of the habits of the superior classes; and as
the person hiring you will probably wish to imitate their ways, she will
perhaps take your hint as to what a “lady” ought to do, and dispense
with conditions, which, on your authority, are pronounced unlady-like.
If a situation seems really desirable you should evince a willingness, and
profess an ability, to do anything, and everything. If you get the place,
and are ever called upon to fulfil your promises, it is easy to say you did
not exactly understand you would be expected to do this, or that ; and
as people generally dislike changing, you will, most probably, be able to
retain your place.
When asked if you are fond of children, you should not be content with
saying ...' “yes,” but you should indulge in a sort of involuntary,
“Bless their little hearts!” which has the double advantage of appearing to
mean everything, while it really pledges you to nothing. Never stick out
for followers, if they are objected to ; though you may ask permission
for a cousin to come and see you ; and as you do not say which cousin,
provided only one comes at a time, you may have half-a-dozen to visit
you. Besides, if the worst comes to the worst, and you cannot do any
*
better, there is always the police to fall back upon. By-the-way, as the
police cannot be in every kitchen at once, it might answer the purpose
of the female servants throughout London, to establish police sweeps,
on the principle of the Derby lotteries, or the Art-Union. Each sub-
scriber might draw a number, and if the number happened to be that
of the policeman on duty, she would be entitled to him as a beau, during
a specified period.
Always stipulate for beer-money, and propose it less for your own
advantage than as a measure of economy to your mistress, urging that
when there is beer in the house it is very likely to get wasted. You will,
of course, have the milk in your eye when proposing this arrangement.
Tea and sugar must not be much insisted on, for they are now seldom
given, but this does not prevent them from being very frequently taken.
Having said thus much by way of preliminary advice, we commence
our guides to service with
THE MAID OF ALL-WORK.
On arriving in your new place you get from the servant who is going
away the character of your new mistress. She has already had yours,
and you have a right to know hers, which, as it is given by a domestic,
who is most probably discharged, will, of course, be a very bad one.
When your predecessor has taken her departure, your mistress may,
perhaps, come into the kitchen, and tell you what you will have to do, or,
at least, a part of it. She will show you the bells, and tell you which is
the house bell, which the parlour bell, which the drawing-room bell, and
which are the bells of the different bed-rooms; but she will not tell you
how you are to answer them when they are all ringing at once, which may
occasionally happen. As it will probably be late when you arrive, you
will have to carry up the tray for supper, when you will be stared at, and
scrutinised as the new servant, by the whole of the family. Let us now
look at your wardrobe. Two of each article will be enough, for if the
washing is done once a week you have a change ; but if only once in three
weeks you must contrive to supply yourself with the smaller articles, such
as stockings and pocket handkerchiefs, from the family stock of linen.
As a maid of all work, you have the great advantage of being a good
deal alone, and can therefore indulge in the pleasures of philosophy.
You can light the fires, and think of HoRBEs. Fasten the hall-door, and
recollect some passage in Locke. Or broil the ham for breakfast while
wrapped up in BAcon.
ou should rise early if you can, but if you cannot you must make up
for it by hurrying over your work as quickly as possible. As warm
water will be wanted up stairs, don't stop to light the kitchen fire, but
throw on two or three bundles of wood, and set them all burning at once,
when you will have some hot water immediately. , Run into the parlour
and open the shutters, light the fire, cut the bread and butter, clean the
shoes, make the toast; and when this is on the table, devote any time
you may have to spare to sweeping the carpet.
Now the family having come down to breakfast you may light the kitchen
fire, and then run up and make the beds. After which you may sit down
to your own breakfast, having previously, of course, taken the opportunity
of helping yourself to tea and sugar from the tea-caddy.
You may now go up stairs, professedly to sweep the bedrooms, but really
to look out of window, and if the street is a narrow one talk to the servant
opposite. Besides, looking out of window saves time, for you are able to
answer the fifty people who come to the door in the course of the morn-
ing with hair-brooms, apples, carpets and rugs, tapes and stay-laces.
eing in a new place, you will be naturally curious to examine all the
cupboards and drawers up-stairs, but do not be too inquisitive at first,
for you will have other opportunities for a good rummage.
You will now come down to cook the dinner; but, as this is another
branch of service, we proceed to tell you how to lay the table. Lay the
knives and forks, taking the latter from the plate-basket, where they will
be kept, though they are probably only Britannia metal or German silver;
nevertheless, call it “the plate,” as it will gratify your mistress.
If the family should be addicted to display, without means, you will
have to set round doyleys and wine-glasses, with a decanter containing
a remnant of British wine, which will not be touched, but will be brought
on “for the look of the thing” every day after dinner. The time has
now arrived for your own meal, and make the most of it. Secure all
the tit-bits, and if you cannot manage to get through the whole of them
at dinner, put away part of them for supper.
About this time the afternoon's milk will arrive, and if you have beer-
money you will take some of the milk out for your own use, taking care
to fill up with warm water, so that you do not cheat your mistress of her
quantity. You will be in the middle of washing up your dishes, when the
family will want tea, and you will have just sat down to your own tea,
when you will probably be asked to do some mending. The best way to
put a stop to this is to turn sulky, do the work badly, or express the
greatest surprise, declaring that all the time you have been out to service
you never, &c., and would be glad to know who on earth, &c., &c., &c.
You must not forget to cultivate your mind, and for this purpose you
had better take in the “Penny Magazine,” and if you read it through every
week, your head at the end of the year will be full of volcanic rocks, the
solar system, primary strata, electric eels, organic remains, and hints for
preserving gooseberries. -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
On washing days there will probably be a woman come to wash; and
in the mutual confidence of the tub, you will probably become very
friendly. You . no doubt, be of great service to each other, you in
giving her bits of this and that, while she may serve you by becoming the
agent for the disposal of your kitchen-stuff.
Do not fall a victim to low spirits, and, above all, avoid sentiment. A
morbid-minded maid of all work, whose heart has been carried off in the
butcher's tray, the milkman's can, or the baker's basket, is for ever lost.
Never hang your affections on a policeman's staff. The force is pro-
verbially fickle, and many a servant girl has pined with a hopeless passion
for one who has moved in a superior station. *
One of the most trying situations for a maid of all work, is in a house
where there are lodgers. She will, very likely, have to take everything at
once to everybody at once. She will be having the first floor and the two-
pair back clamouring at the same time for the only tea-pot in the house,
while the parlour will be calling angrily for his boots, which have been
taken by mistake to the garret, who is writhing in intense agony for his
highlows.
ut philosophy and the “Penny Magazine” will be a balance for all!
the annoyances which chequer the life of the MAID of ALL Work.
BOBADILS OF THE PRESS.
WHEN we read anonymous abuse of the dead, we more than
suspect cowardice and malignity in the nameless scribbler; and
sooth to say, such is our suspicion of the writer of what he calls
Personal Recollections of Thomas Campbell, Esq., now appearing in the
Dublin University Magazine. Until we see the name of the writer
affixed to them—until we can weigh that name with his statements
teeming as they do with charges of meanness, dishonesty, and the
grossest invective, we must even believe that the truth is not in him.
Our doubts of him begin with the beginning of his theme. Let the
reader judge of the spirit of truthfulness—of the decency of the
person who spatters his ink upon the dead.
The writer first met CAMPBELL at one of the Polish balls at Guild-
hall, although he had—
“Little sympathy for those annual gatherings of shopkeeping fashionables and
mountebank patrons of a brave nation—for the benevolence and biscuits, the humanity
and coffee suilling exquisitely blended, which Lond Dudley STUART believes to be the
perfection of philanthropy.”
The writer tells us, he had “written a youthful diatribe against
Nicholas ; ” and he further says—
“So many compliments had been paid to me on the excellence of my composition,
that I thought myself in courtesy bound to go; and go I did, though not without many
an innate shudder at the approaching meeting with the fallow chandlers and pork-
sellers, and THE GREAsy-Fisted CLARINDAs in the City."
Have we not quoted enough Does not the reader at once
appreciate the claims of this person to credibility The poor crea-
ture who speaks of English gentlewomen, the wives and daughters of
English merchants, as “greasy-fisted Clarindas,” is of course to be
believed when he puts in the mouth of the dead the basest and
foulest sentiments that inventive malice can bestow.
And then who is the writer Some fine young Irish nobleman,
that he should feel “an innate shudder” at the thoughts of greasy
fists Will the Hibernian Grandee favour the world with his name
and address, that, acknowledging his rank, it may even now sym-
pathise with his late sufferings : Is he lord, viscount, earl, or
marquess? -
After the above, the reader will as readily believe in CAMPBELL’s
cold, glassy eyes—“like those of a dead haddock”—and in all the
blackguardism and abuse of his contemporaries put into his mouth
by the “shuddering” nobleman, as in the existence of the “greasy-
fisted Clarindas” at the ball in question, or at the like recent gather-
ing on the 13th inst.
The “shuddering” anonymous inquires of CAMPBELL, “if there
were any truth in a story which ALLAN CUNNINGHAM had pub-
lished respecting him f° Whereupon—
“CAM perll's lips quivered with rage.
“CUNNINGHAM," said he, “was the most
infernal liar that ever left Scotland’.”
We believe that a son survives MR. CUNNINGHAM, and to his
filial attention we consign the “shuddering” chronicler.
In conclusion, we ask the conductors of the Magazine, if they
believe that they vindicate the true purposes of literature by giving
currency to personal slander, unsupported as it is by any name? We
well knew that there were unhappy creatures, willing to turn pen
and ink to most malicious purposes; but we certainly believed that
such persons would not be allowed to crawl in the Dublin University
Magazine. -

- IN the winter-months we are doomed to
- have our bosoms wrung with Appeals
for the Houseless Poor. In this present
balmy month of June—for the sun has
at last asserted himself—we are called
upon to compassionate the condition of the
Houseless Lords. The case of HENRY
Brough AM is one of peculiar hardship.
According to his own account, he has
not a House to wag his tongue in—not
a roof to cover his senatorial necessities.
"Many other Lords feel themselves, as
they have declared, in a like hopeless
condition. They are making laws, as
seamen make prize-money, in danger of
their lives. MR. BARRY long ago promised that they should be
taken in, and properly provided for; and the Lords very properly
complain that MR. BARRY has only carried out the first part of his
promise. He even now refuses to say when the new Houses of Par-
liament will be ready. He shelters himself—Lord Brough AM more
than insinuates—under the protection of PRINCE ALBERT ; who, it
is well known, is the head of the Commission for the Parliamentary
Fine Arts; and it is, indeed, very loudly whispered in circles—as
the Post would say—most likely to be well-informed on the matter,
that the building now in course of erection, ostensibly for the accom-
modation of the Lords and Commons, will be solely devoted as a
Picture Gallery for all the Portraits (if, indeed, without a further
grant they can be crowded into it,) of the Head of the Fine Arts;
that is, of PRINCE ALBERT himself!
Under these circumstances, the Lords must look after themselves.
We do not see why they should not—as people hold their whist
clubs—carry on the business of legislation at one another's houses;
with easy-chairs, chicken and champagne, for the reporters.
We regret to observe that some very painful sparring has taken
place between Lord Brough AM and MR. BARRY. His Lordship
says, “MR. BARRY's promise is not worth the paper it is written
on ;” and MR. BARRY, in a low voice, has been heard to declare
that the surest way for his Lordship to make paper of no worth
whatever, was to write upon it. On this point, MR. BARRY con-
fidently appealed to Lord BRough AM's publisher.
-
THE LINCOLN's INN FloweR show.
A Flower Show on a somewhat extensive scale has taken place in
Lincoln's Inn New Square within the past week, and the attendance
of lawyers has been somewhat numerous. Among the specimens, we par-
ticularly noticed the Daisy Lyndhurstiana, or Chancellor's buttercup,
which excited considerable attention. A Marigoldia Knight Brucica was
also the subject of much admiration, and it obtained the prize of the
japanned watering-pot, given by the Ironmongers' Society as an en-
couragement to horticulture. Among the shrubs, we particularly noticed
Ashica Mortua Facta Super—a dead, done-up ash, which fell a victim to
a disturbance of the system in its old age, having been violently torn
away from its native land when turned forty.
One or two of these veteran trees have been already moved twice ; and
as three removes are said to be as good—which means as bad—as a fire,
they may as well be burned at once, if there is any idea of further
disturbing them.

ENGINEERING EVIDENCE.
sually the most profitable part of the
present railway mania consists in persons
going before the committees of the House
of Commons to give what is called engi-
neering evidence. Engineers are con-
sequently in very great request; and
while they are at their present tremendous
premium, Punch has it in contemplation
to take a few pupils, and qualify them for
giving their testimony at ten guineas a day
from each committee before which they
are examined.
Punch undertakes to qualify any one
to pass an examination in the following
triumphant style, for a bonus of fifty
pounds, and a share in the profits of the evidence.
Q. Nº. sir, can you explain the engineering advantages of this line !
A. I can.
Q. Do so, if you please, in your own manner.
A. It is obvious that if I take a mean isosceles triangle of three-and-a-
quarter, it gives a gradient of five to the square inch ; and thus tun-
nelling will be avoided through at least one-half of the line.
Q. But how about the embankments :
4. If I cut a square inch out of a rhomboid, and throw it off at right
angles, it is clear that there can be no support to the sides. If, on the
other hand, I establish a fulcrum on the surface of a spheroid plane, it is
impossible that the embankments can fall in ; and this, I take it, is the
great advantage of the proposed line.
The Chairman. Allow us to ask, sir, whether you think a gradient of
two will be sufficient.
A. Certainly I do. If I had a lever and a screw now in the room, I
would undertake to show in five minutes that a patent axle, working on a
broad gauge and going consecutively in rotation after a double stuffing-
box, would be of ; sufficient to do all that is required.
This answer created the greatest excitement in the committee-room,
and strangers were at once ordered to withdraw, that the committee
might deliberate. In a quarter of an hour the public were re-admitted,
and the chairman said he had only one more question to ask of the last
witness. It was simply this: Can it be possible for the broad gauge to
wear out the cylinder of a single valve, without tearing off the siphon-
cock from the main boiler
The witness, after making a few drawings in his note-book, and a
reference to a five-foot rule, with which he measured the table in three
different directions, answered deliberately, and with great emphasis—
Certainly not.
The chairman immediately announced the preamble of the bill to be
proved; and the rush to the door was so overwhelming, that our reporter
was carried into Group Z, and thence on to the Palace-yard cab-stand.
Expresses were waiting for every part of the kingdom, and the shares
immediately went up to 75, at which everybody refused to realise; but a
flaw having been discovered after every one had left the room, and
before the committee had finally broken up, the bill was subsequently
declared to be lost, and the shares fell to 2, with a downward
tendency.

TEMPLE TACTICS.
IT is to be regretted that professional success cannot always be accom-
plished by legitimate means, and we are sorry to see that several most
deserving junior barristers have resorted to the system of posting
placards on the outside of their chamber-doors, as an attraction to clients.
We do not mean to say that they have enormous posters announcing—
“alarming sacrifices;” “briefs at reduced prices;” or “motions of
course, at one-third of the usual charge ;” but we allude to a more delicate
kind of puffing, which is becoming by far too general. The practice to
which we allude, consists of shutting the outer door, and putting on the
outside little notices, to the effect, that MR. is at Westminster Hall
or the House of Commons, when he is very possibly inside his chambers,
cooking—or attempting to cook—his own chop with the Bachelor's
Dispatch, which undertakes to boil an egg, fry a steak, toast a bit of
bread, and heat a gallon of water, all in five minutes—a feat, which
sometimes terminates with an explosion of the whole apparatus.
It would be a good speculation to print a few announcements for the
doors of barristers' chambers; and we subjoin one or two, as specimens.
R. Mr. —, privately engaged with his honour, the Master of the
lls.”
“Mr. —, lunching with the Lord Chancellor.”
* Mr. , having just received a refresher, gone into the refreshment-
room at the House of Commons.”
Notices in the above style would add to the personal as well as the
professional éclat which it is sought to gain by them.
Curiositits of Neſospaper 3Literature.
AMong the advertisements of the last week, we find the following
remarkable announcements of facts, which fairly come under the head of
phenomena. We are told in one place that there may be had “An airy
bed-room for a gentleman twenty-two feet long by fourteen feet wide.”
The bed-room ought, indeed, to be airy to accommodate a gentleman of
these dimensions. Again, we read of “A house for a family in good
repair,” which is advertised to be let with immediate possession. A
family in good repair, means, no doubt, one in which none of the members
are at all cracked. The last oddity to which we shall call attention, is an
announcement of there being now vacant “A delightful gentleman's
residence.” The “delightful gentleman” must be rather proud of his
delightful qualities, to allow himself to be thus strangely advertised.

MRS. CAUDLE'S CURTAIN LECTURES.
LECTURE XXII.
CAUDLE COMES HOME IN THE EVENING, AS MRS. CAUDLE HAS “JUST
STEPPED OUT, SHOPPING.” ON HER RETURN, AT TEN, CAUDLE
REMONSTRATES. -
º
R. CAUDLE, you ought to have had
a slave—yes, a black slave, and
not a wife. I’m sure, I’d better
been born a negro at once—
much better. What’s the matter
now 2 Well, I like that. Upon
my life, MR. CAUDLE, that’s very
cool. I can’t leave the house
just to buy a yard of riband, but
you storm enough to carry the
roof off. You didn't storm 2–you
only spoke 2 Spoke, indeed! No,
sir : } ’ve not such superfine feel-
ings; and I don't cry out before
I’m hurt. But you ought to
have married a woman of stone,
for you feel for nobody: that is,
for nobody in your own house.
I only wish you'd show some of
your humanity at home, if ever
so little—that’s all.
“What do you say? Where's
- - my feelings, to go shopping at night?
** º When would you have me go?
º ºº. In the broiling sun, making my
face like a gipsy's "I don’t see anything to laugh at, MR. CAUDLE ;
but you think of anybody's face before your wife's. Oh, that’s plain
enough ; and all the world can see it. I dare say, now, if it was
Miss PRETTYMAN's face—now, now, MR. CAUDLE | What are you
throwing yourself about for I suppose Miss PRETTYMAN isn't so
wonderful a person that she isn't to be named ! I suppose she’s
flesh and blood. What? You don't know? Ha! I dare say.
“What, Mn. CAUDLE You'll have a separate room you’ll not be tor-
mented in this manner? No, you won’t, sir—not while I’m alive. A
separate room 1 And you call yourself a religious man, MR. CAUDLE
I'd advise you to take down the Prayer Book, and read over the
Marriage Service. A separate room, indeed . CAUDLE, you’re
getting quite a heathen. A separate room Well, the servants
would talk then I But no : no man—not the best that ever trod,
CAUDLE—should ever make me look so contemptible.
“I shan't go to sleep ! and you ought to know me better than to
ask me to hold my tongue. Because you come home when I’ve just
stepped out to do a little shopping, you’re worse than a fury. I
should like to know how many hours I sit up for you? What do you
say? Nobody wants me to sit up 2 Ha! that’s like the gratitude of
men—just like 'em 1 But a poor woman can't leave the house,
that—what Why can't I go at reasonable hours?, Reasonable
What do you call eight o'clock: If I went out at eleven and
twelve, as you come home, then you might talk; but seven or eight
o'clock—why it’s the cool of the evening; the nicest time to enjoy
a walk; and, as I say, do a little bit of shopping. Oh yes, Mr.
CAUDLE : I do think of the people that are kept in the shops just as
much as you; but that’s nothing at all to do with it. I know what
you’d have. You'd have all those young men let away early from
the counter to improve what you please to call their minds. Pretty
notions you pick up among a set of free-thinkers, and I don't know
what When I was a girl, people never talked of minds—intellect,
I believe you call it. Nonsense 1 a new-fangled thing, just come
up ; and the sooner it goes out, the better.
“Don’t tell me! What are shops for, if they’re not to be open late
and early too ! And what are shopmen, if they’re not always to
attend upon their customers : People pay for what they have, I
suppose; and arn’t to be told when they shall come and lay their
money out, and when they shan't Thank goodness 1 if one shop
shuts, another keeps open; and I always think it a duty I owe to
myself to go to the shop that’s open last: it’s the only way to
punish the shopkeepers that are idle, and give themselves airs about
early hours.
“Besides, there's some things I like to buy best at candle-light.
Oh, don't talk to me about humanity I Humanity, indeed, for a pack
of tall, strapping young fellows—some of 'em big enough to be
shown for giants. And what have they to do? Why nothing, but
to stand behind a counter, and talk civility. Yes, I know your
notions; you say that everybody works too much : I know that.
You'd have all the world do nothing half its timo but twiddle its
thumbs, or walk in the parks, or go to picture-gallerics, and museums,
and such nonsense. ...Very fine, indeed; but, thank goodness I the
world isn't come to that pass yet. -
“What do you say I am, MR. CAUDLE A fooliº woman, that
can't look beyond my own fireside 2 O yes, I can ; quite a far as you,
and a great deal farther. But I can't go out shopping a little with
my dear friend MRs. WITTLEs—what do you laugh at Oh, don't
they? Don't women know what friendship is Upon my life
you’ve a nice opinion of us ! Oh, yes, we can—we can look outside
of our own fenders, MR. CAUDLE. And if we can't, it’s all the
better for our families. A blessed thing it would be for their wives
and children if men couldn't either... You wouldn't have lent that
five pounds—and I daresay a good many other five pounds that I
know nothing of-if you—a lord of the creation —had half the sense
women have. You seldom catch us, I believe, lending five pounds.
I should think not.
“No : we won't talk of it to-morrow morning. You're not going
to wound my feelings when I come home, and think I’m to say
nothing about it. You have called me an inhuman person; you
have said I have no thought, no feeling for the health and comfort of
my fellow-creatures; I don't know what you haven't called me; and
only for buying a-but I shan’t tell you what ; no, I won't satisfy
you there—but you’ve abused me in this manner, and only for shop-
ping up to ten o'clock. You’ve a great deal of fine compassion, you
have 1 I'm sure the young man that served me could have knocked
down an ox; yes, strong enough to lift a house : but you can pity
him—oh yes, you can be all kindness for him, and for the world, as
you call it. Oh, CAUDLE, what a hypocrite you are 1 I only wish
the world knew how you treated your poor wife
“What do you say? For the love of mercy let you sleep? Mercy,
indeed . I wish you could show a little of it to other people. O yes,
I do know what mercy means; but that's no reason I should go
shopping a bit earlier than I do—and I won't. No—you’ve preached
this over to me again and again; you’ve made me go to meetings to
hear all about it: but that’s no reason women shouldn't shop just as
late as they choose. It’s all very fine, as I say, for you men to talk
to us at meetings, where, of course, we smile and all that—and some-
times shake our white pocket-handkerchiefs—and where you say we
have the power of early hours in our own hands. To be sure we have;
and we mean to keep it. That is, I do. You'll never catch me
shopping until the very last thing; and—as a matter of principle-
I'll always go to the shop that keeps open latest. It does the young
men good to keep ’em close to business. Improve their minds,
indeed Let 'em out at seven, and they’d improve nothing but
their billiards. Besides, if they want to improve themselves, can't
they get up, this fine weather, at three ? Where there’s a will,
there’s a way, MR. CAUDLE.”
“I thought,” writes CAUDLE, “that she had gone to sleep. In this
hope, I was dozing off, when she nudged me, and thus declared her-
self:-‘CAUDLE, you want nightcaps; but see, if I budge to buy
'em till nine at night !” - º

THE ROEBUCK.
“THE Roebuck,” says Golds MITH, “is the smallest of the deer kind
known in our climate ;” and it appears to have been growing “small by
degrees, and beautifully less, till it is now one of the most insignificant
animals to be met with even in the Commons. This extraordinary
animal sheds its horns, and, indeed, it has been known sometimes to
lose its head, particularly during the sitting of Parliament. “The
Roebuck,” continues Goldsmith, “with humble ambition, courts the
rising slope.” It does not, however, rise very high, though it once
took a leap at a bar which astonis, “d every one. The Roebuck's motions
are very easy, consisting chiefly of motions of course, which are the
easiest of any. It is possessed of much cunning, and is found to make a
very good retreat by its various windings. The Roebuck is not a social
animal, and though very easily subdued, can never be thoroughly tamed.
It is subject to terror without a cause, and, indeed, it seems seldom to
have in view a cause of any kind. The Roebuck is never to be entirely
relied on, for it has capricious fits of fierceness. This animal is more
appreciated in America—particularly in Canada—than it is in Europe.

IMMENS E OPPORT UNITY.
MR. Ainsworth, “on whom the Editorship of the New Monthly
Magazine has devolved,” parades a list of contributors to that brilliant
periodical, and says he has secured the aid of several writers “eminent not
only for talent, BUT For HIGH RANK.”
Are they of high rank as authors, or in the Red Book? MR. AINs-
worth can't mean that the readers of his Magazine care for an author
because he happens to be a lord—a flunky might—but not a gentleman
who has any more brains than a fool. A literary gentleman who respects
his calling, doesn't surely mean to propitiate the public by saying, “I am
going to write for you, and—and Lord Fitzdiddle is going to write too.”
Hang it, man, let him write—write and be—successful, or write and be
—unsuccessful, according to his merits. But don't let us talk about high
rank in the republic of letters—let us keep that place clear. Publishers
have sought for lordlings, we know, and got them to put their unlucky
names to works which they never wrote ; but don't let men of letters
demean themselves in this way.
No, WILLIAM HARRIson, trust to your own powers and genius—trust
to the harrowing influence of the “Revelations of London”—trust to the
contributors “who have shed a lustre over the Magazine,” the enter-
prising and erudite. Whatdyecallem ; Thingamy, “whose domestic tales
have found an echo in every bosom,” and the rest. But don't let us
hear any more of high rank as a recommendation.

VIEWS ON RAILROADS.
Ince we never go anywhere without having
º, an eye to the picturesque, we took our
º ſ sketch-book with us, intending to make
# views of the scenery during one of our
* recent trips, by railroad. Seeing the
º country, we know, is one of the chief de-
lights of travelling, and we supplied our-
selves therefore with a telescope, as well as
drawing materials, for the purpose of fully
enjoying the beauties of nature, and trans-
ferring them on the instant to the immor-
tal pasteboard. Unfortunately, whenever
we succeeded in catching a glimpse of any
thing that we thought worthy of the im.
perishable lead, it was whisked away from
our vision; and just as we had commenced
foreshortening something thirty miles off,
some fresh, object was suddenly brought
close up to the window of the carriage, to the
exclusion of everything else that our eyes
had been resting on. A castle in a
momentary perspective was suddenly blotted out by a policeman's hat,
and a hanging wood was abruptly curtained in by a flying signal. A
background of peaceful meadows was broken, as if by magic, with the
smoking chimney of a screeching engine, and sheds seemed sliding past on
a. º like a moving panorama, going at the rate of sixty miles
all hour.
Having heard that there was a beautiful bit of still life at about twenty
miles from London, we determined to make a desperate effort to catch
the favourable moment for sketching it. The sun was shining brilliantly,
and we thought the weather had conspired with Nature to add loveliness
to the spot i but alas ! the express train was proceeding at such a rapid
rate, that the following was the only sketch we
had an opportunity of taking. Though it
scarcely gives an adequate idea of the beauty
of the spot, the picture will not be contemptible
in the eye of a true admirer of the beauties of
Nature.
The mile-post in the foreground, standing
bravely up under the intense heat of a July
sun, has its story prettily told by the shadow
that proceeds from it. A rich background of
wild grass shows the reckless luxuriance of
Nature, and the whole scene is one of delicious
calm, which will be found very soothing to the
spirit.
The next view we were enabled to take is of another character, and in-
dicates the presence of agricultural industry. It shows the labourer—or,
at least, his legs—walking to his work; and there is an expression in the
foot—a fine manly tone in the heel—a deter-
mined activity in the toe, which tells the cha-
racteristic energy of the British Yeoman. That
foot, in the hands of Pickersgill, might have
taken its place by the side of that great effort
of art—the bone in his picture of PRofesson
Owen.
We had not the time to throw into the foot
all the soul we could desire ; but such as
it is, and such as it appeared to us in
our rapid transit by the rail, we have no
hesitation in giving it. But it was in the
Tunnel that the true artistical feeling came
over us. We there fancied we were going through some of those
subterranean passages through which the
Sibyls used to pass before the invention of
sewers provided them with a fitting thorough-
fare.
There was something sublime in the emo-
tion with which, amid the roar of the engine,
the rattle of the rails, the screams of the
whistle, the choking sensation from the
smoke, and the tingling of the cheeks and
eyes from the ashes, we made the an-
nexed sketch of what we saw in our passage
through the Tunnel.
We were so pleased with that last result,
that we determined on proceeding again by night through the same
Tunnel; and we were rewarded by witnessing a figure that the pencil
of MACLISE could alone do justice to. We are
still haunted by the demoniac glare of the
policeman under the strong lurid light of a
bull's-eye.
Description would, however, faint quite
away in any exertion it might make to de-
scribe the awful object; and we therefore give
the sketch exactly as we made it.
Our readers will perceive that genius can
draw beauties from the most unpromising sub-
jects: and as the gentlemen described by
SHAKSPERE drew “sermons from stones"—
rather hard reading, by the way, those sermons must have been—so have
we been able to elicit a series of sketches of scenery taken during a trip
by railroad. -
A PUMP AND A WELL.
We have not unfrequently heard the members of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science styled, generally, a set of Pumps. We
could not, therefore, help considering it a curious coincidence, that one of
that learned body, the Rev. T. RANKIN, described the other day at Cam-
bridge in “Section A,” some “observations made by him in a deep well
at Huggate.” The question, what a Pump could get out of a well, may
be an interesting one to the British Association; but the world at large,
we take it, is sufficiently satisfied on that point already. "We do not know
what observations a scientific mind would make in a deep well; but a
common one might give utterance to some such as the following. The
common mind is supposed to be at the bottom of the well, in a bucket.
Obs. 1. I wonder how deep the water is.
2. It is very cold : I wish I had put on a great coat.
3. As soon as I get up I’ll have a stiff glass of brandy-and-water hot.
We question if the conclusion of the common mind is not as philo-
sophical as any that the Rev. T. RANKIN came to.

* APPEAL TO ROME tº
WHEN the Irish Colleges' Debate was coming on at the beginning
of the week, the Chronicle kindly took the pains to consult HANSARD
for MR. O'Conn ELL, and put before the old gentleman his early
opinions upon the beauty and loveliness of mixed education. His
arguments were very strong and his language charmingly pathetic :-
“Can you, who are convinced of the truth of your church, dread the consequences
of a fair development of the public mind by education I have heard a great many
arguments against this plan of education in common-but it is a powerful argument, on
the other hand, that there is nothing more desirable than that the youth of this country,
separated as they are by twenty-five or twenty-six leading persuasions, should, while the
unsophisticated and affectionate feelings of youth are warm in their bosons, have the
inestimable advantage of mixing together in friendly and undoubting intercourse, so
that the angry and jealous passions which may afterwards come upon them may be
assuaged by the gentle recollections of their youthful friendships.”
Beautiful beautiful it's as touching as the Sorrows of Werter.
DAN must have been very much obliged to the Chronicle for bringing
these “gentle recollections” of his forward : though they may pos-
sibly have spoiled “a speech of remarkable power” in a different way.
But if the old Liberator could not speak, there was a young one
at hand with the new doctrine—and a very pretty doctrine it is too—
which, as we all know the freedom of speech which the Liberator
allows to his members, may be supposed to be that of the devout papa
as well as the godly son who propounds it.
Because MR. Wyse, of Waterford, approves of the Irish Colleges’
Bill, MR. John O'Conn ELL says, Wyse is a schismatic Catholic ;
and consigns him—never mind whither.
The Irish Bishops don't approve of the Bill—every Catholic ought
to listen to his Bishops—if he refuses he is a schismatic, and the end
of schism is—never mind what.
If you are dissatisfied with the Bishops, MR. John says, you have
one remedy–AN APPEAL To Rom E. So Rome is to be the mistress
when the empire is disunited; and Repeal means the supremacy of
the Pope in Rome ! One can hardly believe the words, though they
stare you in the face.
MR. O'Conn ELL said,
“He obeyed the prelates of his Church (hear); for who were the ecclesiastical autho-
rities for the Catholics of Ireland, but the Bishops of Ireland? He told the right hon.
gentleman again, that he ought to look to Rome, and not to the House of Commons,
for advice on this subject. Even if this house were composed wholly of Roman Catho-
lics, it would be no tribunal to bring a question before, which was between him and the
Bishops of Ireland. Here was the declaration of the Catholic Bishops—the authority
which he believed to be the supreme authority in Ireland, controllable only by the
Sovereign Pontiff, declaring this bill was dangerous to the faith and morals of the
Catholic people.”
Look here, gentlemen Repealers, at the kind of freedom which your
Liberator has in store for you.
If people are to pay filial obedience to these ghostly fathers, there
is no end to the paternal homage they may see fit to exact. If the
Bishops interfere about a lecturer on anatomy or jurisprudence,
why not about a family matter, a bargain, or a lease ? They have a
right to choose your library: suppose they advance a right to control
your ledger ? Suppose the Bishops demand it, as a Catholic you
must obey—always with the liberty of appealing to Rome.
Here is the O'Conn ELL creed in the nineteenth century:—‘Down
with the British, and on your knees to the Pope. Away with the
Saxon, and put your trust in the Roman.” As we write this, we begin
to boil and foam over like the Standard.
There is MR. Davis, of the Nation, who pants for freedom, and
would not mind a little blood-letting to procure it. Well, Mn.
Davis, suppose the Saxon done for, and see what comes next—a
reign of Catholic Bishops and the Pope supreme.
Dare you preach against this as you preach against English
tyranny ? - Dare you rebel against DAN and his supreme Pope, as
you would against us oppressors over the water? Do you men, who
assume to be the leaders of the Liberal party in Ireland, acknow-
ledge this doctrine acquiesce in a supremacy which has been tried
in, and kicked out of, all Europe It would seem as if you did. It
would seem as if those ardent spirits that bluster about cutting
English throats are so cowed, that if O'Connell were to set up the
Inquisition they daren't protest—and these are the men who shriek
out for liberty, and gasp for the freedom “for which SARsfield
fought, and Tone organised 1”
Ask any Committee Man.
Did you ever know a Railway from a place no one knows where to a
place no one ever heard of before, with branches everywhere, of which
the gradients were not easy, the cuttings few, the tunnelling next to
nothing, and the traffic immense?
RAILWAY SLAVES. :
The Members of the House of Commons on the Railway Committees
complain with some show of justice that they have to undergo perfect
slavery. It is cruel of Counsel to weigh them down with such a fearful
load of talk, and such a frightful weight of evidence. Can such slaves as
the members of the Railway Committees be the representatives of a free
people : Is it in vain to appeal to Counsel, and entreat of them to show
some mercy to the unhappy sufferers? We recommend that a copy of
the annexed sketch should be affixed to the standing orders of the House
of Commons on Railway Bills, and that attorneys should be bound to
paste one—immediately under the endorsement of the fee on all the briefs
of Counsel.

“DEAR PUNCH,
“My wife, MRs. CHARLEs RALLEDGE, generally goes out of town
about this time for a week, to give the children the benefit of a dip in the
ocean at Gravesend.
“As we have four—I may say, as fine children as you ever saw—their
clothes must be attended to, and their baggage is pretty considerable.
“Mrs. R. travels with four large camel's-hair trunks, three portmanteaus,
four carpet-bags, her bonnet-boxes, twenty-three articles in all, besides
the basket for baby—no mother and lady can travel with less. Cloaks
and umbrellas of course, I don't include. That you understand. I
We generally (that is, Mrs. R. and the family, for I can º go down
on Saturdays a bit) go to the boat in a hackney-coach. We have done
so, I may say, ever since I was in business, and I did so with the first

We have been
uently and urgently #. adopt the admirable examples of our
ENKINs, and devote, from time to time, a column to what he so aptly
styles “Table Talk.” -- º
The convenient position of our box at the Opera, known as the Punch omnibus, will
enable us, in our own proper person, to pick up the chit-chat of the week on Saturday
nights; and as we are always too happy to receive between the acts, and during the ballet,
our multitudinous friends, including BRough AM and SIBThoRP, we shall probably learn more
of even legislative news, than we can glean from the cumbrous reports of the morning
papers. --
Our prime favourite the Ex-Chancellor amused us, on Saturday last, with an account of
a bill which he had introduced to the House of Lords
sometime back, for the express purpose of “Securing
the Real Independence of Parliament.” The very idea
of the thing made us laugh so as nearly to split our
hump, for there is nothing more calculated to give
intense piquancy to a joke, than gravity and command
of countenance in the telling it. We were sceptical,
and sent our boy Dick, the first thing on Monday, for
a copy of the bill; and the preamble, we find, seriously
contains the following words:— --
.*And whereas, Persons should no longer be suffered to assist
in making the Laws which they continually do violate: Beit
therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and
with the Advice and Consent of the lords spiritualºft emporal
and C in this p Par º, and ºth:
this
Authority of the same, That from and after the passing
Act if any Judgment shall be given against any Peer or any
Member of the Commons House, for any Debt, and it shall be
found that such Peer or Member hath not paid the Money into
Court, or that the Debt shall remain unpaid, then and in that
Case such Peer or Member shall be altogether incapable of
sitting and voting in either House of Parliament, unless within
Twelve Calendar Months from the Process being issued against
him he shall pay the Debt.” ‘’”
When the bill is sent down to the Commons, it is
intended to give a more extended effect to the great
principle involved in it. An entire purification of
both Houses will be proposed, and no person will
be allowed to make laws who is in the habit of vio-
lating them ; not only bankrupts, but adulterers,
dicers, duellists, sabbath breakers, all who swear and
get drunk, and talk scandal; those who smuggle cigars
or Eau de Cologne; every man who underrates his
income to the commissioners, or ventures to the
Queen's costume ball, without paying the tax on
hair-powder, all, all will be chassé'd, and we shall
at length have a Parliament after our own heart.
Go it, Bhough AM, we devoutly say, and more strength
to your elbows 1 º'

MOST No BLE FESTIV ITIES.
HEN the first part of LADY
- \s ſº London DERRY's Tour was
Nº-N printed in the New Monthly
º Nº. Magazine, there appeared,
Mr. Punch,in your columns
a wicked attack upon the
work, which especially fell
foul of her Ladyship's
grammar. I can’t say it
was in consequence of
your remarks, but somehow
there was no bad grammar in
* No. 2.
“Have the goodness to
keep your eye upon the
man who writes the para-
graphs about the fêtes at
Holderness House: and
correct that slave as you
have admonished his noble
mistress.
“I just read in the
Herald (that is, in the
Standard, which is the
same thing) that “The
Manchioness of "Lon-
DoNDERRY will have a thé
dansante at Holderness
House: nearly 300 cards
of invitation have been circulated among the leading aristocracy. The line is fixed at
from 3 to 8 in the afternoon.”
“What the deuce does this mean? How do you fix a line to a thé dansante, and
how do you go on fixing it for five hours in an afternoon What is a thé dansante, and
when was thé of the feminine gender It is neuter in this country, but has always
been masculine in France—as stronger than most of the drinks imbibed there.
‘About the noble Marquis, the same journal contains a paragraph, not conspicuous
for eccentricity of grammar, certainly, but noble
in its own way—in fact there never was a puff
about Holderness House that had not some fun
in it. The paragraph in question runs as
follows:–
“‘On Monday evening a grand banquet was
given by General the Most Noble the Marquis of Lon-
donderry, to the officers of the Second Life Guards,
of which distinguished military corps the Noble
Marquis is Colonel. Several other eminent military
commanders, connected with other regiments, both
cavalry and infantry, had also the honour of
receiving an invitation.
“Every preparation suitable to so important an
event was made by the noble and gallant Lord of
Holderness.” -
“I think it is only at Holderness House that
you get this most noble style of writing. Com-
moners can't come near it. What a noble figure
of speech that is in which the Marquis, because he
lives at Holderness House, Park Lane, is called
the Lord of Holderness—in the same way, my
Lord Lansdown might be called the Marquis of
Piccadilly, or your humble servant the gallant
Lord of St. Alban—from St. Alban's Place, Hay-
market, where I and many other ‘eminent com-
manders” have cheap and airy lodgings.
“That touch about the ‘other eminent com-
manders’ can't be passed over without admiration.
There were other military eminences, ‘both
cavalry and infantry;” therefore the Marquis is
an eminent military commander, and greater than
the others whom he “honours with an invitation.’

PUNCH*S GUIDE TO SERVANTS.
THE NURSERY-MAID.
NY one may undertake the place of a nur-
sery-maid. As every female has, when
a girl, been in the habit of carrying,
letting fall, snubbing and slapping
either her own or some one else's little
brothers and sisters, it is easy to say
you have been accustomed to children.
Supposing that you enter service as
a nursery-maid, there will, perhaps,
be an upper nurse, who will be, in
fact, your mistress. Your care at
home will be to wait on her; and
when walking out, you will have to
keep the children at a convenient
distance while she flirts with her beau,
who will probably be one of the Bri-
tish soldiery. This will be very tan-
, talising to you at first; but you must
recollect that your own time will come,
if you wait patiently.
\ ome places are very different from
A others. You may go into a wealthy
family where the children are kept up
stairs, like live lumber, in the nursery,
and are only brought out now and then
for show, like the horses of the state
carriage, or the best tea-set. If you
curb their spirits that they may be
docile on those occasions, and turn
them out to the best advantage as
far as appearance is concerned, you
will be a favourite with your mistress.
In some places you will be what is
called “assisted” by the mother; or,
in other words, interfered with, just
enough to destroy all your attempts
at discipline. In this case, your mis-
* / tress will doubtless tell you, that if
Q- you cannot manage the children, she
must find some one who can, and will
give you warning accordingly.
It is not necessary to give you any particular directions about your dress,
for the penny Belle Assemblée will furnish you with all the latest fashions;
and you have only to do in cottons and stuffs, what your mistress is doing
in silks and satins. You should bear in mind, that you are not obliged to
make yourself a dowdy to please any one ; for nature has doubtless given
ou, a pretty face, and the gifts of nature ought to be made the most of.
esides, if you are a servant at home, you are a lady out of doors; and
you may even keep a parasol at the greengrocer's, to be ready for you
when you take a holiday.
When you go to a new place, your mistress will, perhaps, tell you the
character of each child, that you may know how to manage their different
tempers; but you will, of course, use your own discretion. If one is
pointed out as a high-spirited little fellow, you may be sure that he is
fond of killing flies, tying toys to the dog's tail, striking you, and crying,
as if you had struck him, when he hears his mamma coming. If you are
told that one of the dear boys has a turn for finding out how everything
is made, and he must not be checked, as his papa intends him for a civil-
engineer, you may be sure that the juvenile spirit of inquiry will be
shown in pulling your work-box to pieces, unless you turn his attention
to the furniture, which he should be encouraged to dissect in preference
to any of your property.
When you have a baby to take care of, some say you should be par-
ticular in its food; but if the child cries you have no time for this, and
you must stop its mouth with anything that comes handiest. Indiscrimi-
nate feeding is said to lay the foundation of diseases which remain with
the child through life; but as you do not remain with the child so long,
this is not your business. A nurse who knows thoroughly what she is
about will keep a little Godfrey's Cordial, or some other opiate, always at
hand—but quite out of sight—to soothe the infant; for nothing is so dis-
tressing to the mother, or such a nuisance to yourself, as to hear a child
continually crying. When there is only one infant these soothing syrups
must be cautiously applied, lest the necessity for a nurse should terminate
altogether, and you are thrown out of your situation.
An infant sometimes requires example before it will take to its food,
and, as it is very nice, you may as well eat one half of it first, to encourage
the infant to eat the other. Use sugar in children's food very sparingly,
and, lest the infant be tempted to want some of the sugar that is saved
out of the quantity allowed, lose no time in locking it up out of sight in
your own tea-caddy... If you wish to save your beer-money, recollect that
milk is heavy for children, unless mixed copiously with water. As nothing
ought to be wasted, you can drink what remains, instead of beer, at your
dinner.
There are many very troublesome duties that some nurses undertake
in order to amuse the child; but as Nature is acknowledged to be the
best nurse, you had better let Nature try her hand at all the hard work,
while you confine yourself to that which is easy.
When a child reaches a certain age it will begin to want amusement,
when, if there are no toys, you may give it the poker and tongs, or set it
down on the floor before the coal-scuttle. Opening and shutting a box is
also an amusement; and as it involves occasionally the shutting in of the
child's own fingers, the operation combines instruction also. As a child may
be troublesome while being washed, give it the powder-puff; and as every
thing goes to the mouth, the dear little thing will commence sucking the
powder-puff, which will keep it quiet.
A very interesting age in children is when they begin “to take notice.”
When taking a walk with the children it cannot be expected that you can
always have your eyes on them, and you must therefore accustom them
to take care of themselves as much as possible. Besides self-preservation
is the first law of Nature, and a child cannot too soon be taught to follow
it. ... Thus if you are looking about you and the children get into the road,
while a carriage is passing, you will probably not be aware of their danger
till it is past, when you will begin slapping and scolding your little
charges that they may know better for the future.
It is a very fine thing to encourage generosity in children, and you
should therefore talk a great deal about the presents you have received
on birth-days and on other occasions from the little dears in the place
where you last lived. This will of course give your mistress a hint as to
what she ought to do. For the children will naturally ask to be allowed
to make you presents, and the parents not liking to check the amiable
feeling, and desirous of not being thought shabby in comparison with your
former employers, will no doubt give—through the hands of the children
—what you may have occasion for.
If you have nephews and nieces you may supply 'them with *
little articles of dress that are pronounced to be “past mending.” If
your mistress notices that the stock of children's things diminish, you
can suggest that “things won't wear for ever,” which often passes as an
apology for a sensible diminution in the number of socks and pinafores.
You may observe that Master So-and-so is such “a spirited little fellow,
that he does wear his things out very fast,” and your mistress will be
satisfied if she thinks her child's spirit has caused half his wardrobe to
evaporate.
If you follow all these instructions to the letter you will make as good
a Nursery-Maid as the best of them.
THE SPREAD OF HOMOEOPATHY.
A MELANCHoly spectacle was last week presented at the Albion Tavern,
Aldersgate Street, where no less than eighty unfortunate gentlemen,
actuated by one common delusion, met together to hold what they called
a festival in behalf of the Homoeopathic Association. The mania of
homoeopathy has indeed come to a pretty spread . Poor LoRD WILTON
presided over these infatuated individuals, and unhappy LoRD Robert
GRosvenoR supported him : hence a gloom will be cast for ever over
Wilton Street, leading from Grosvenor Place.
MR. STAPLEs, the landlord, provided an excellent dinner for them, and
the meeting wore the aspect of the most extreme conviviality; but it is
painful to reflect on the state of mind concealed under this show of mer-
riment. There is something appalling in the idea of these eighty gentle-
men being gentlemen at large. There is no knowing what they may do;
but, at all events, those who will spend money on homoeopathy ought not
to be trusted with property. We hope MR. STAPLEs did not give them
steel knives and forks; they ought only to have been allowed wooden
spoons. Had we to entertain such a company, we should certainly apply
their own principle of infinitesimal dilution to their liquors, out of consi-
deration for their heads, whose infinitesimal brains a very little
might upset. We would also have several barbers and a number of
strong men in attendance, with a large assortment of strait-waistcoats
ready.

WE have already pointed out the alteration likely to be made in poetry
and song-writing by the introduction of Railroads, and we this week give
another specimen of the probable effect of the change. We shall hear
no more now of the Lily of the Vale or the Village Rose, but the Pearl of
the Refreshment-room and the Daisy of the Rail will supersede the once
popular maidens alluded to. . The following touching ballad is supposed
to be addressed by one of the luggage superintendents to one of the
female waiters at the same station, and may be called—
THE PORTER TO HIS MISTRESS.
Oh maiden, but an instant stay,
And let me breathe my vow ;
I know the train is on its way,
I hear its thund'ring row.
Another moment crowds will stand
Where now to thee I kneel;
And hungry groups will soon demand
The beef, the ham, the veal.
Turn not away thy brow so fair,
'Tis that, alas ! I dread;
For thou hast given me, I swear,
One fatal turn a-head.
I've linger'd on the platform, love,
My brow with luggage hot;
Avoice has whisper'd from above,
“Porter, take heed, love knot l”
O'er thee mine eye doth often range:
I've mark'd thee take the pay
From those who, ere you bring their change,
Rush to the train away.
Turn not, &c. &c.
THE EUREKA.
That notable invention, the Eureka, or Latin Verse-grinder, was tried
yesterday before a committee of young gentlemen from the public schools,
*:::: anxious to have their Latin exercises done with the least possible
trouble.
The proprietor asked the young gentlemen to fix a subject upon which
the instrument might perform, accordingly MR. Snooks, of Westminster,
proposed the quarrel between Roebuck and SomeRs.
The machinery of the wondrous instrument was set in motion, and
the following lines ground out to the music of a barrel-organ:—
Sligonis membrum, Buckſ vult pullere nasum,
Transfugit Aactuaus Rhetoris in gremium.
Hunc pius AshLeius laudat, decus Exeter Aulae,
Pontificumque comes Bobbius Inglisius.
Hunc laudat Dominus PRELEIDEs turnabout agri,
Laudat HUMUsque ferox ille tremendus aper.
Desine BUCKE Domum nostram examimare querelis
Inque potatones, Padde, retro propera.
As some decidedly English expressions had crept into the lines, the
inventor explained that he was educating his machine to grind English
verses likewise ; hence, that for the present a little confusion might arise
between the languages. A translation of the above verses was then called
for by MasTER Spoon, of Charterhouse, when the following appeared, the
organ playing “Rule Britannia.”
When Sligo's member aims at Roebuck's nose,
The frightened Buck to Speaker's bosom goes.
Him Ashley praises, piousest of lords,
And INGL1s, known at missionary boards:
Him HUME the Caledonian boar so stout
Admires, and PEEL, the Lord of Turnabout.'
Buck, plague the House no more! and Paddy clap
A 'tato into thy potato-trap. ; *
-
Several double-barrelled Eurekas were ordered for Eton, Harrow, and
Rugby, and we hear of a forthcoming soireé, where LoRD W-M L–NN—x
proposes, to perform some choice fantasias on this extraordinary
instrument.
* ARS LOR GA, VITA BREVIS."
BRough AM should adopt this motto. He is continually complaining of
the ridiculous consideration shown to art in the building of the new House
of Lords. “What has art to do with legislation?” says Brougham. “Every-
thing,” answers, Punch. We will make a proposal to his Lordship.
Rather than the hopes of artists and lovers of art should be dashed by a
too hasty completion of their Lordships' house of call, we respectfully place
Baough AM's Last Misery.—No House.
at their disposal our back shop. As the average attendance of their Lord-
ships is half-a-dozen, they would have room enough, and BRough AM is at
home there already, and could correct the reports of his own proceedings
for our journal without the delay now experienced in the journeys of our
Devils to and from Grafton Street.
Proof-sheets of the forthcoming number would be furnished to their
Lordships, and they would thus obtain that amusement they are now
reduced to seek in the sparring exhibitions of CAMPBELL and BRough AM.
Or, if BRough AM's antipathy to art be incurable, and he wish to testify it
strongly, let the National Gallery be turned into a House of Lords. Thus
the notion of any connection between architectural beauties and the upper
house would be at once done away with, and a new and more suitable
residence might afterwards be provided for our national pictures.

THE SCHOOL OF DESIGN.
TO MR. PUNCH.
SIR,-Being an encourager of the fine arts, I employed a young friend
of mine, who seemed as full of promise as a promissory note, to decorate
my house in fresco, and I gave him the subject of the siege of Troy; for I
know that enthusiastic youth delights in aiming so high that it shoots very
often out of sight altogether. I did not interfere during the progress of
the fresco, and the result was, that my wall was adorned with the follow-
ing spirited battle-piece.

You will ive that the conception is fine, though the treatment is
awkward. The idea of putting the Trojan General quite out of danger,
looking through a telescope, betokens an instinctive knowledge of the art
of warfare. There is also novelty in the treatment of the cannon-ball,
which is placed half-way between the cannon and the object it will hit, so
that doubt, which is one of the first sources of the sublime, is thus at-
tained. Nevertheless, I thought the artist wanted education, and I sent
him at my own expense to the School of Design, when, after two years'
hard study under WILson, he rewarded my patronage with the following:
(
I can't say I admire the sort of thing he has been taught to do so much
as the style of thing he did when he followed the natural bent of his own
genius. In the first fresco he did give me entire figures, but in the above
I only get men with their legs, feet, and arms broken short off, or Egyptian
hieroglyphics of men capering about on Etruscan Wases. It is true there
is a flower-pot, with a flower in it, that leaves a good deal to the imagina-
tion, and is, I suppose, some bulbous root dug out of the ashes of Pompeii
or Herculaneum, to the study of which, I am told, the pupils of the School
of Design are chiefly confined.
My object in writing to you is to apprise you what you may expect your
son to become—if you have a son—should you send him to the School of
Design, which you probably might have thought of doing.
Believe me your obedient reader,
And very humble subscriber,
Qſìe Capabilities of the 3Eletttit Oſtlegraph.
WE understand the electric telegraph will shortly be applied to several
domestic purposes. The experiment will first be tried at one of the large
houses at the Albert Gate, Hyde Park. A servant will be stationed in
one of the garrets, and another servant will be placed in the cellar, and a
communication will be sent through the telegraph for the latter to bring
up a bottle of wine. Should this be found to answer, wires will then be
hung from floor to floor, and an anxious mother in the back parlour will
be able to learn in a second what is going on in the nursery without any
of the trouble of going up there. By this method, seven flights of stairs
will be cleared in one sentence ; and the house, once brought down from
its extreme height, may have a chance of finding a tenant.
The only difficulty in families working the telegraph, will be in
procuring servants who know the electric alphabet, but this will soon
be got over, now that the schoolmaster is so much more “at home,”
than he used to be. It is expected that in large establishments, where
several servants are kept, a saving of fifty per cent. will be effected in
maids-of-all-work alone, whilst it stands to reason a stair-carpet will last
twice as long under the new régime of messages being carefully delivered
by the electric telegraph.
Several eating-houses, too, intend working an electric telegraph, so as
to bring the cuisine on a greater level with the dining-room. . The cla-
morous speaking-pipe, in that case, will be dispensed with, and the incon-
venience of hearing every other minute “One Mock,” or “Two Greens,”
bawled out whilst you are ruminating over a piece of green fat, or are in
the depths of a leading article, will no longer be felt by the tympanum of
those gentlemen who prefer silence to noise.
By this method, also, gentlemen at taverns, where there is singing in
the evening, will be enabled to hear a song right through without any of
those interruptions in the middle of it of “Two Rabbits,” or “Chop well
done,” which are proverbial for destroying the sentiment, and mutilating
the melody, of the finest bacchanalian songs.
Lastly, the lonely condition of the tollmen on Waterloo Bridge—who
are at present in a very depressed state, owing to the opening of Hunger-
ford Bridge—might be humanely bettered, if an electric telegraph were
established along the lamp-posts on either parapet of the bridge. They
might then know what it was to hear the voice of their fellow-man, and be
cheered in their solitude by exchanging with one another those speculative
remarks about the weather, which, in minds constituted for society, make
up one half of the amenities of life.
A FEW NEW WORDS FOR GENERAL CIRCULATION.
ALBERTIse. To fail in design—to alter for the worse.
BRough AMDICATE. To talk a great deal to little purpose.
BUNNic-VERse. A term applied to poetry, or compositions, not under-
stood, or, if understood, not worth understanding.
ELLENBRoejection. The act of sending a wanderer home to his friends
against his own will.
FERRANdic. Fabulous—very imaginative.
GIBBSIDious. Unaccountable.
GRAHAMITIve. Inquisitive about other people's affairs.
Oconnellization. Distraction, anarchy, confusion, discord; also beggary.
PEELoRIC. Ambiguous.
PEELVERsorious. Given to turning—not to be depended upon.
Faults on both Sides.
MEMBERs in England, and Deputies in France, are always comparing
the navies of the two countries, and their complaints are so much alike,
that from their catalogue of faults, it would seem to be, as far as the
number of efficient ships is concerned, literally six on one side and half-
a-dozen on the other. Let us hope this is so far true that it will be a
long time before there is known to be any real difference between them 1
GLASS HOUSES.
THE newspapers contain an account of an importation of a thick de-
scription of window-glass intended for roofing. This kind of residence,
however, will never do for MR. Roebuck, and such members as are in the
habit of throwing stones. :

Perhaps that repeated tillage may in some degree account for their won-
derful fertility. Every little condiment of his attire reminds him of his
fascinations and his perfidies. He usually keeps a broken heart in his

I have had his acquaintance. Nay, he is a man of such extemporaneous
susceptibility, that he will buy a pair of gloves in any given High Street
of an afternoon, and will have an early grave, or a separate maintenance,
at his finger's end throughout the evening. - -
“Quite another man is MR. BRAssfºruńks, our comic genius. His
imitation of a grindstone in full work is a painful reality; and he is also
perfectly at home in the hencoop, and without a rival among cats or
puppies. But his railway-train is perhaps his master-piece: so perfect is
the illusion, that one can positively distinguish the first, second, and third-
class carriages as they pass his lips. R. Brassfeatures is moreover
very familiar with some of the leading insects. His bluebottle is a gem;
and in his cockchafer he succeeds miraculously in the hum.

his endless cigars, but
I know he is a gentle-
man by his patent
boots, which are depo-
sited, with their con-
tents, on the table close
to my brandy-and-wa-

sings a very good song
out of the Bohemian
Girl—that is, the words
of it are out of the Bo-
hemian Girl: as for
the air, not being quite
familiar with the ori-

tune of the Chough and

it is, I can tell you, to
hear him. - - -

demonstrate that, though a man may be a woollen-draper, he may yet roll
his eye in a superfine frenzy out of business hours.
“Then we have our sporting character; in a cutaway coat, spotted
cravat, cords and tops—real sporting, I assure you; and a gentleman
who “does just what he likes with his firm, and might have been a
partner years ago, only he couldn't bear the notion of mixing up his name
with TwistER AND BRiggs—but nevertheless doesn’t know that he shan't

stage, and who gives undoubted imitations of small actors at the minimum

as the originals are not so well known as their talents deserye to make
them. But I forbear to raise your admiration higher. It is enough if
you know, as we know, that the most remarkable men of our country are
to be found in our country's commercial rooms. We seek not the accla-
mations of the popular voice. To you only do we offer to unmuzzle our
wisdom, and in the peaceful retirement of our slippers and our cheroots,
we shall content ourselves with the reflection that, while all the world &c.

MRS. CAUDLE'S CURTAIN LECTURES.
) |
MiR-and-Mas-caudLE AT THE SEA-81DE-
LECTURE XXIII.
MRS, CAUDLE “WISHES To KNow IF THEY’RE GOING TO THE SEA-
SIDE, or NOT, THIS SUMMER—THAT’S ALL.”
“Hot + Yes it is hot. I’m sure one might as well be in an oven
as in town this weather. You seem to forget it’s July, MR.
CAUDLE. I’ve been waiting quietly—have never spoken ; yet not a
word have you said of the sea-side yet. Not that I care for it
myself—oh, no ; my health isn't of the slightest consequence. And,
indeed, I was going to say—but I won't—that the sooner, perhaps,
I’m out of this world, the better. Oh, yes: I dare say you think so
—of course you do, else you wouldn't lie there saying nothing.
You're enough to aggravate a saint, CAUDLE ; but you shan’t vex
me. No ; I’ve made up my mind, and never intend to let you vex
me again. Why should I worry myself?
“But all I want to ask you is this: do you intend to go to the sea-
side this summer? Yes? you'll go to Gracesend ? Then you’ll go
alone, that’s all I know. Gravesendſ You might as well empty a
salt-cellar in the New River, and call that the sea-side. What? It’s
handy for business? There you are again I can never speak of
taking a little enjoyment, but you fling business in my teeth. I’m
sure you never let business stand in the way of your own pleasure,
MR. CAUDLE—not you. It would be all the better for your family
if you did.
“You know that MATILDA wants sea-bathing; you know it, or
ought to know it, by the looks of the child; and yet—I know you,
Caudle—you’d have let the summer pass over, and never said a
word about the matter. What do you say? Margate's so expensire?
Not at all. I’m sure it will be cheaper for us in the end; for if we
don’t go, we shall all be ill—every one of us—in the winter. Not
that my health is of any consequence: I know that well enough. It
never was yet. You know Margate’s the only place I can eat a
breakfast at, and yet you talk of Gravesend 1 But what’s my eating
to you? You wouldn't care if I never eat at all. You never watch
my appetite like any other husband, otherwise you’d have seen what
it’s come to.
“What do you say? How much will it cost? There you are, MR.
CAUDLE, with your meanness again. When you want to go yourself
to Blackwall or to Greenwich, you never ask, how much will it cost
What? You never go to Blackwall? Ha! I don't know that ; and if
you don’t, that’s nothing at all to do with it. Yes, you can give a
guinea a plate for whitebait for yourself. No, sir; I’m not a foolish
woman; and I know very well what I’m talking about—nobody
better. Aguinea for whitebait for yourself, when you grudge a pint
of shrimps for your poor family. Eh! You don't grudge’em anything?
Yes, it’s very well for you to lie there and say so. “What will it cost?
It’s no matter what it will cost, for we won't go at all now. No;
we’ll stay at home. We shall all be ill in the winter—every one of
us, all but you; and nothing ever makes you ill. I’ve no doubt we
shall all be laid up, and there’ll be a doctor's bill as long as a rail-
road; but never mind that. It’s better—much better—to pay for
nasty physic than for fresh air and wholesome salt water. Don't call
me “woman, and ask ‘what it will cost.’ I tell you, if you were to
lay the money down before me on that quilt, I wouldn’t go now—
certainly not. It’s better we should all be sick; yes, then you’ll be
pleased. -- º
“That's right, MR. CAUDLE ; go to sleep. It’s like your unfeel-
ing self! I’m talking of our all being laid §: and you, like any
stone, turn round and begin to go to sleep. ell, I think that’s a
pretty insult How can you sleep with such a splinterºin your flesh? I
suppose you mean to call me the splinter?—and after the wife I’ve
been to you! But no, Mr. CAUDLE, you may call me what you
please; you’ll not make me cry now. No, no; I don’t throw away
my tears upon any such person now. What? Don't Ha! that’s
your ingratitude 1 But none of you men deserve that any woman
should love you. My poor heart 1 -
“Everybody else can go out of town except us. Ha! if I’d only
married SIMMons—What? Why didn't I? Yes, that’s all the
thanks I get. Who’s Simmons? Oh, you know very well who
SIMMonsis. He’d have treated me a little better, I think. He was
agentleman. You can't tell? May be not; but I can. With such
weather as this, to stay melting in London 1 and when the painters
are coming in 1 You won’t have the painters in? But you must; and if
they once comein, I’m determined that none of us shall stir then.
Painting in July, with a family in the house ! We shall all be
poisoned, of course; but what do you care for that ?
“Why can't I tell you what it will cost? How can I or any woman
tell exactly what it will cost? Of course lodgings—and at Margate,
too—are a little dearer than living in your own house. Pooh tº You
know that? Well, if you did, MR. CAUDLE, I suppose there’s no
treason in naming it. Still, if you take 'em for two months, they’re
cheaper than for one. No, MR. CAUDLE, I shall not be quite tired of
it in one month. No: and it isn’t true that I no sooner get out than
I want to get home again. To be sure, I was tired of Margate three
years ago, when you used to leave me to walk about the beach by
myself, to be stared at through all sorts of telescopes. But you don't
do that again, MR. CAUDLE, I can tell you.
“What will I do at Margate? Why isn't there bathing, and picking
up shells; and arn’t there the packets, with the donkeys; and the
last new novel—whatever it is, to read—for the only place where I
really relish a book is at the sea-side. No, it isn't that I like salt
with my reading, MR. CAUDLE I suppose you call that a joke?
You might keep your jokes for the day-time, I think. But as I was
saying—only you always will interrupt me—the ocean always seems
to me to open the mind. I see nothing to laugh at ; but you always
laugh when I say anything. Sometimes at the sea-side—specially
when the tide's down—I feel so happy; quite as if I could cry.
“When shall I get the things ready? For next Sunday? What
will it cost? Oh, there—don't talk of it. No : we won't go. I shall
send for the painters, to-morrow. What? I can go and take the
children, and you’ll stay? No, sir: you go with me, or I don't stir,
I’m not going to be turned loose like a hen with her chickens, and
nobody to protect me. So we’ll go on Monday ? Eh!
“What will it cost? What a man you are: Why, CAUDLE, I’ve
been reckoning that, with buff slippers and all, we can’t well do it
under seventy pounds. No ; I won’t take away the slippers, and say
fifty: it’s seventy pounds, and no less. Of course, what's over will
be so much saved. CAUDLE, what a man you are Well, shall we
go on Monday? What do you say—you'll see ? There’s a dear.
Then, Monday.”
“Anything for a chance of peace,” writes CAUDLE. “I consented
to the trip, for I thought I might sleep better in a change of bed.”
LAW AND THEATRICALS.
A Few days ago a case was brought before the Court of Exchequer, the
merits of which turned on the question whether the part of Ferdinand in
the Tempest is or is not light comedy. Ariel's description of Ferdi-
nand was placed on the record to prove that he is light comedy, and the
other side had been served with notice to produce Prospero's last speech,
which was admitted under a judge's order. There was also in Court an
office-copy of Miranda's reply to Ferdinand's declaration, with a counter-
part of the assignment executed by The Duke, and an affidavit of service
on the part of Ariel. Unfortunately the Chief Baron put an end to the
case by suggesting that it should be referred, and the fun of the thing will
consequently be confined to the chambers of the learned gentleman who
is appointed arbitrator.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ABDICATION OF DON CARLOS.
E have taken our time about
* publishing the only authentic
account of that august event,
which is contained in the fol-
Cld lowing letter :-
SIR LANCELOT GREAVES, KNT.,
TO LORD JOHN MANNERS.
* Bourges, May 22.
“My LoRD,--I have witnessed
to-day an awful, a noble cere-
mony. ... The newspapers have
already acquainted you with our
beloved Don CARLos's affecting
manifesto apropos of his resigna-
tion of the Crown of Spain. He
takes the title of Count MoLINA;
and his son, that of Count MonTE
MoLIN–Count MoUNT WINDMILL
—one of the titles of the ingenious
hidalgo of La Mancha, after his
heroic attack on the well-known
fortresses of that name.
“The act of abdication has
just been solemnly performed at
ourges. The great officers of the
Crown, and some of the faithful allies of the unfortunate monarch, were
present. Not one of his former friends in France would come to attend
the sad ceremony. One and all turned on him the cold shoulder. Perish
the dastards ! But from England, some of the true and chivalrous sup-
porters of the exiled Charles hastened to wait upon him. Among these
were LoRD RANELAGH, PETER Borthwick, Esq., M.P., - Jenkins,
Esq., M.P. (Morning Post). Having ratted from Carlism since the
change of proprietorship, the Morning Herald was not present.
“The party assembled was a select rather than a numerous one. , Mis-
fortune generally has such company. The King's Confessor, who is also
Grand Inquisitor, Home Secretary, and charged with the War Depart-
ment, DoN BASILlo SoMBRERo, Archbishop of Crocodilopolis (in partibus);
the Finance Minister, Don LazARILLo De Tormes (who likewise waits
at table); and a few more of the great officers of state; were assembled in
the “Saloon of Ambassadors’ in the two-pair back. The Throne-room
was gorgeously decorated with the curtains of a French bedstead that
usually stands there, but which was replaced for the occasion by a large
velveteen settee.
“Before the settee was a teapoy, upon which the Royal Insignia were
deposited, laid on a noble cushion worked in worsted by the Royal Con-
sort of the King. Chairs, stools, &c., were placed for the rest of the
august party. As the Crown Jewels were not forthcoming, a handsome
crown and sceptre were borrowed from the theatre at Bourges, by the
kind permission of the director.
“He attended as “guardian of the crown jewels,' wearing the costume
of the Cid; and I am ashamed to say that a pawnbroker of the town,
with whom the impoverished monarch has had some dealings, said he
would not let the stars, cordons, laced uniforms, &c., entrusted to him,
out of his sight; on hearing which, the good-natured PRINCE of the
Asturias said—“Let him attend as Uncle of the Royal Family.”
“At one o'clock, punctually, the Royal Donkey Chaise, driven by the
Master of the Horse, was heard in the court-yard. The King ascended
with the PRInce of Asturias on his arm. The Uncle of the Royal Family
invested the royal pair with their stars, epaulets, and cordons, and stood
by their sides (never leaving them), as the great doors of the Throne-
room were flung open by Don LAzanillo De TorMEs. The ambassadors
were then admitted, to kiss the hand of the august Exile.
“When BEAU BRUMMELL was dying in dotage and poverty, his bio-
grapher tells us, the poor old man would often be visited by comfortable
illusions, and, sitting in his ragged dressing-gown, in his garret, fancied
he was entertaining there the PRINCE of WALEs and the Duchess of
Devonshire, and Charley Fox and SAMUEL Rogers, Esq., and the young
bloods, bucks, and beauties of that brilliant day.
“A similar beneficent delusion has taken hold of Don CARLos. He
fancies that all the ancient possessions of the Spanish Crown still belong
to it. And on this solemn occasion, and before he retired into private
life, he made a distribution of what poor dear SIMPson (almost the last
remnant of chivalry in England) used to call the royal property.
“The court ceremonial being arranged, the Princes seated, the
ambassadors, officers, &c., standing round, CHARLEs W. rose, and in a
voice trembling with emotion, said:—
“‘Before resigning my kingdom to my beloved son, I think fit to
signify to him my royal dispositions.
“‘lst. I had appointed as Generalissimo of my forces, N. SENORA DEL
CARMEN, to whom I paid much honour, embroidering a petticoat for her
by my Queen's royal hands, and giving her her pay regularly as General-
in-Chief of my armies. As she did me no good service, (otherwise, how
should I have been an exile here at Bourges 1)—I, the King, dismiss
FIELD-MARSHAL NUESTRA SENora DEL CARMEN from the command of my
troops, and place in her stead, N. SENORADEl PILAR, to whom I transfer
the rights, pay, rank, and embroidered petticoat, of her predecessor.
Our War Minister, the ARCHBishop of CRocodiLopolis, will make out the
brevet at once.”
“The Prince and Don Basilio bowed at this, and all the company
cried “Long live the King !’
“‘I have other appointments to make, continued the Monarch, “and
rewards to confer upon those who have been faithful to me in exile.”
(Cheers). “Noble Cavaliers, your number, alas! is but few; but the
fewer the better, where rewards are to be had.”
“‘As I have no present means of paying the wages of my faithful
secretary and barber, Don JoACHIM STRAPPADo, I give him an order upon
the Intendant of my silver mines of Mexico for twenty-five thousand
donkey-loads of ingots, and make him DUKE of LATHERERo.”
“Poor Don Joachim pulled rather a long face when he heard of the
twenty-five thousand donkeys, and said, “If I go to Mexico, there will
be twenty-five thousand and one.”
“‘My excellent MARIQUITA, waiting-woman of my august Queen, and
chief intendant of my kitchen, whose fidelity to my royal race, but espe-
cially whose skill in cooking my favourite dish of Garbanzos in oil has
touched my august heart, I propose to reward suitably. When my fleets
arrive from the Indies, I shall present her with a diamond stomacher as
big as any omelette she ever fried for me, and a kitchen-service of rubies
and gold. I hereby give her an estate in Peru, whereof the title-deeds
shall be made out in her name, so soon as the revolted province has
returned to its allegiance. Meanwhile, I create her Duchess of OLLA-
PodRIDA.'
“The Duchess declined, however, to take the title, because the Royal
Chancellor wanted fifteenpence as a fee for entering it in the Golden Book
of the Grandees of Spain.
“‘Come forth, Don GERoNiMo Widdicombo, faithful master of my horse !
Since the reverse of my fortunes, I have had indeed only a donkey; but
thou hast well and truly curried him. I appoint thee Viceroy of my
kingdom of Naples, Knight of my order of the Golden Fleece, and invest
thee with the collar of the same.’
“As there was no collar at hand, Don GERONIMo was invested with the
collar of poor Dapple the donkey, which dragged the chaise of the King
and Queen ; and he disappeared, grinning most lugubriously through that
Ornament.
“The King then asked the knife and boot-boy, who performs the minor
offices about the palace of the Royal Exiles, whether he would prefer
having his wages paid in full; or, when the King came to his own again,
would like to become Governor of Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia P
“Try me !” said the boy, delighted, and holding out his hand, whereupon
he was immediately advanced to the governments in question. … This
seemed a good deal to disappoint the knife-boy.
“It now came to the turn of the King's English adherents. Turning to
Lord RANELAgh, the King said, “My lord, in the action off Bilboa you
admirably distinguished yourself against the English navy.' . His lordship
was proud to own he did. “I appoint you, then, Admiral of the Spanish
ARMADA.”
“CARLos QUINTo next called upon
Don Tom Maso JENKINs, the advocate
of legitimacy in all countries. JEN-
KINs stepped forward, in his Spanish
costume, and was squeezed in the old
Monarch's arms so heartily, that tears
came into the loyal servant's eyes.
* How, Don ToMMAso, shall I reward ºf
you and the Press of England As º
for your noble comrade the Morning
Herald .”
“‘The Erald? My Grandmother!'
interposed Don ToMMAso, scornfully.
* * I shall make him Chief Herald
of my son's court, and hereby create
him Lord NIGHTCAP, King-at-Arms.
But what shall I do for you, my
cousin, as I have given away all the
dignities of my crown, and all my
foreign governments? No, stay; there
is Brussels. JENKINs, you shall be
the modern DUKE of Alva, and my.
Governor of the Low Countries.’
“‘The Low Countries ' ' shrieked
JENKINs; “does your Majesty think
I'd go to hany place as was low '
and, tearing the cockade out of his
hat, he left the rootm.
“Try and console our fiery ally, my good cousin. Don PEDRO Boath-
wick 1 it is now your turn, my friend. Titles I know you heed not–

your eyes say yes! Ho my treasurer 1 Pay to Don PEDRo on the instant
five hundred millions of reals.” - - -
“That sum was immediately handed over to Don PEDRO in Carlist six
per cent bonds, signed by the BARON DE HABER, which a butterwoman at
Bourges agreed to take at the usual premium. -
“The august ceremony was now concluded. Don CARLos descending
from the throne, the Count of MoLINA led the PRINCE OF ASTURIAs up
to it, and, saluting CHARLEs The SixTH, exclaimed, “Long live the King!”
“Such of the courtiers as had hats waved them tumultuously, and
uttered the same loyal shout. And “Long live Charles the Sixth” every
true heart will say that loves the antique glories and the future pros-
perity of Spain.
“I have no more, my dear Lord, to add. The DUCHEss of OLLA-
Popsida provided a collation, which smacked so strongly of the national
garlic, that you need not wonder if my feelings overpower me. -

THE POET BUNN'S ADDRESS
on The close of The SEASON AT DRURY LANE THEATRE.
SoME surprise and disappointment have been manifested in vari-
ous quarters that the address delivered by the poet BUNN, on the
very auspicious event of the closing of Drury Lane Theatre, was not
couched in verse, as might have been expected from the peculiar
talents of the manager.
The fact seems to be that the poet had prepared an appropriate
speech in numbers; but in the agitation of the moment, and fortu-
nately for the audience, he forgot what he was going to say. We
have been fortunate enough to get a copy, which we embalm for
the benefit of posterity:-
POETICAL ADDRESS,
Which ought to have been spoken on the closing of Drury Lane, by the
Poet BUNN (for the first time), in character.
If other lips could venture to impart
The gratitude that fills another heart;
If, 'mid the solitude of marble halls,
I hear a British public's tuneful calls,
At such a moment, wheresoe'er I be,
I only ask, you will remember me.
(Erpected applause.)
When fair TERPsichone, with lute or lyre,
Gives unto each, what all perchance require;
When old Apollo, bursting from his cloud,
Makes ophicleides and serpents shriek aloud;
When time, amid its ever-changing haze,
Brings up once more the light of other days;
When slumber's pinions linger round my head,
In the deep anguish of a four-post bed;
When music's strains are heard within this pile—
Oh, smile on me as you were wont to smile !
(Anticipated enthusiastic cheers.)
'Tis true old SHARspERE, with immortal name,
No longer habitates the niche of fame;
But, if the changing of the public taste
Has all SHAKSPERIAN memories effaced,
What could I do? how execute my task,
Kind friends, at such a moment, I would ask?
You do not to the question put reply,
Then waft forgiveness in a heart-drawn sigh;
Like hidden memories which flash around,
Leaving a symbol, but without a sound.
(Expected shrieks of “Beautiful tº “Go it, BuNN ?” &c.
. I pause a little moment, to review
The course which I have run, urg'd on by you.
Upon this stage what sacred memories throng
Processions nearly half an acre long :
The horse's neigh, the lion's splendid roar—
All this I’ve done—say, could I have done more 1
No carpet green this glorious stage displays,
Give me the laurel, let them take the baize.
Ha, ha! I see the joke electric run
From mind to mind. You understand my pun
Thanks for that smile. And now, kind friends, adieu
I go to France, but leave my heart with you;
That heart, by anxious sorrow often vex'd ;
Be tender with it—till September next.
(A probable whirlwind of rapture, ending in a hurricane of
enthusiasm, and a whole conservatory of bouquets.)

WANTED A GOVERNESS, ON HANDSOME TERMS,
BY A PRETTY FELLOW.
WE lately met with the subjoined advertisement in a morning news-
paper :-
OVERNESS.—A comfortable home, but without salary, is offered to
any lady wishing for a situation as GOVERNESS in a gentleman's family, residin
in the country, to instruct two little girls in music, drawing and English, a thoroug
knowledge of the French language is required. Direct to A. B.-Times, 27 June.
An advertisement long enough fully to suit A. B.'s purpose would, we
know, have cost that economical “gentleman” too much. We perceive,
clearly, that A. B. is one of those nice persons who love to divest the flint
of its integuments; and out of very pity for the poor creature, we will
ask, free of expense, the following questions of any lady desirous of his
“comfortable home.”
How few slices of bread, with how little butter upon each, will she be
content with for breakfast Can she drink her tea without sugar; or if
not, what would be her smallest number of knobs? Will she engage not
to want ham should there be any on the table at that meal! Will she,
though ever so hungry, always abstain from lunch : Will she promise
never to take fish or soup at dinner, to ask only once for meat, decline
taking wine when invited to do so before company, and altogether eschew
malt liquor Can she agree to dispense with º before going to bed,
notwithstanding she may feel faint for the want of it? Can she sleep in
a garret upon a straw mattress, without curtains; and how few blankets
will she need to cover her? Will she find herself in all requisites for her
toilet, including soap, unless she is prepared to put up with common
ellow t
y And now, having asked these questions for A. B., we will ask a few
more of him. Pray, does he give his cook and housemaid any wages f
If so, does he consider their menial services more valuable than the instruc-
tion of his children? What, according to his ideas, is the equivalent, by
weight, in victuals, to “music, drawing, and English,” with “a thorough
knowledge of the French language 1" Does he regard a governess as a
horse, that he would work her like one, and on terms corresponding to
keep and stabling And lastly, on what principle or pretence does he
presume to call his family “a gentleman's f" Answer that, A. B. I

To Authors about to Publish.
MR. N. P. WILLis, the American author, has arrived in this country.
We mention this fact for the benefit of those would-be literary gentlemen
who are anxious to appear in print, as an invitation to MR. WILLIs for
dinner will be certain to secure them the advantages of publication,
without any risk or º: Literary gentlemen are cautioned, however,
against speaking too freely in their conversation after dinner, as mis-
takes have been known to occur in the best regulated memories—even

THE iron hand of Railway enterprise is fast tearing up by the roots all the pastoral and poetical associations
of our youth, and cottages near woods, as well as mossy cells or leafy nooks, are being superseded by
Railway termini. Where the cow once lowed, the engine now screams, and the pipe of the gentle Corydon
is completely put out by the funnel of the locomotive. Phillis is sent flying by the power of steam, and the
hermit of the dale is compelled to break his staff or cut his stick, to make way for theimmense staff of officials
required on the Railways.
What is to become of those long accustomed to a pastoral state of existence, we are quite incapable of
conjecturing. They cannot remove themselves by certiorari to the woodlands wild or the vale sequestered
from the hum of men; for it would indeed be a hum of the most grievous kind to encourage them in the hope
that anything in the shape of sylvan seclusion is now open to them. As we perceive that the Isle of Dogs

APROPOS OF A MISSING PICTURE.
A Few weeks since we visited the National Gallery. We had just sus-
tained an hour's infliction of the Academy Exhibition, and rushed, as is
our wont after the dose, among the old pictures, to repose our eye, and
take the taste of the Academy out of our mouth. We saw and criticised
a Holbein—a new acquisition. “There are better pictures of the master,”
we soliloquised; “but, nevertheless, this is in place here, and we bidit
welcome.”
A week after we took Judy and our child to visit
the old pictures. We are forming the boy's taste in
art. To our surprise, the Holbein had disappeared.
We questioned the gentlemen who dose about the
door-ways, and received the usual official answer—
“Don’t know anything about it.” So, in despair, we
called upon Load , one of the trustees.
“Where is the Holbeinfº was our question. His
Lordship blushed slightly, twiddled his eye-glass,
shifted uneasily in his chair, and replied evasively—
“The Holbeing "
“Yes, that was added to the Gallery last week."
“We gave 600l. for it,” said his Lordship, with a sort of sigh.
*But where is it?”
“Why you see, my dear Punch, we have since discovered—”
We smiled at the idea of the trustees discovering anything.
“That is,” said his Lordship, correcting himself, “Mr. —, the eminent
dealer, assures us it is no Holbein at all—very difficult to distinguish a
copy from an original at times—immense caution required—”
“Before buying,” we suggested. “But where is it?” -
“Why we hope to induce Mr. —, from whom we bought it, to take it
back again. We have offered to give him 2001. to take it off our hands,”
said his Lordship, now really blushing. “But he is very obstinate—quite
unpatriotic, in fact.”
“Of course the 200l. is to come from the trustees' poekets?”
His Lordship opened his yes ve wide.
“I don't understand you,” he replied.
“Nor pictures either,” we added, jocularly.
“A great comfort that we have these eminent dealers to apply to,” said
his Lordship. “How we should manage without their advice, I cannot
imagine.”
“How you manage with it, is perfectly apparent,” we rejoined, rather
angrily (for our blood was up), and taking our hat, left the room, reflect-
ing what a blessing it is to have trustees of the National Gallery who have
such a proper distrust of their own judgments, and such a readiness to
repair an error, even at a cost of 2001–to the nation,
THE MOSAIC CROMWELL.
Consider ABLE sensation has been created throughout the country
by the expected dissolution of the Parliament through the seizure of
its goods and chattels. The celebrated passage in history which
describes the entrance of CRomwell and his soldiers into the House
of Commons, when the Protector, pointing to the Speaker's mace,
bid them “take away that bauble!” is likely to find a parallel in the
proceedings in HowARD c. GossETT–though the actors in the scene
will be much more ignoble than those who took part in the affair
that the part of CRomwell and the soldiers will be personated by
Officers of the Sheriff; and the words, “Take away that bauble !”
will be used in the sense of “Seize that mace in execution 1* If
the House of Commons should have all its sticks seized, what on

PUNCH2S GUIDE TO SERVANTS.
THE CLERK.
wº He word Clerk, which was formerly synony-
H | mous with clergyman, included all who had
|^ taken orders, and the clerk to this day takes
the orders of the customer, or follows the
orders of his principal. Clerks are those
| engaged in the departments of trade or busi-
\/ ness that require the pen, and any clerk
ought therefore to be pen-ny wise, though he
should by no means be pound foolish.
There are almost as many varieties of
clerks, as there are different sorts of cloth,
from the extra superfine government official
down to the coarse copying article in an
attorney's office.
The education of a clerk is of course a
matter of importance, and the following in-
structions to a parent, intending his child for
the desk, should be implicitly followed. First
take your son, and soak him well in spelling
and writing. Grind in a few ounces of gram-
mar, stuff with arithmetic, and season with
geography. Lard with a little Latin, and
--- baste with birch whenever you find it
requisite. Serve up on a high stool, at the first convenient opportunity.
As our guide is not intended for the parents of clerks, but for clerks
themselves, we proceed to give the latter a few general directions for
their moral and intellectual guidance.
Recreation will probably be the first consideration with the clerk him-
self, and we therefore proceed to give this branch of the subject our very
earliest attention. The term “recreation” does not necessarily apply to the
time after office-hours, for in the absence of the principals the course of
the day will furnish many opportunities for relaxation from the toils of
business. The newspaper, for instance, expands the mind, and is easily
put down when you hear any one coming; while in some offices, not liable
to very sudden intrusion, a game at cribbage—which is a great quickener
of the faculties—may be ventured on. Where the clerks are all on
friendly terms, and particularly in a government office, leap-frog is an
agreeable exercise; for it not only fills up the time, but obviates the chief
objection to the employment of a clerk, on the ground of its being seden-
tary. After office-hours you will of course be your own master, and the
improvement of your mind will be your chief object.
The great struggle for the emancipation of the commercial intellect is
one in which you are interested, and perhaps no revolution was ever so
important as the great counter-revolution which the metropolitan shopmen
are now engaged in. You will of course range yourself under the banner
of “early closing,” and will rally round the said measure in defence of
your evenings to yourselves, your domestic hearths, your half-prices at
the theatres, your mental improvement, your billiards, your books,
your Mechanics' Institutions, your free-and-easies, your cigars, your
philosophy, and your brandy-and-water. You will fraternise with those
gallant linendrapers who have sworn to bring freedom home to their
country's counters, and who would rather perish at the scissars' point than
lose one quarter of a nail of the great principle they are contending for.
Amid the recreations you may select for the evening, you will be told
to avoid excitement, and certainly an excited clerk must be an object of
some curiosity, if not of downright ridicule. Beware of literary ambition,
and do not covet the mad enjoyment of contributing an occasional pun or
gush of poetical passion to the pages of a periodical. Many a clerk has
found a premature garret, and sunk into an early workhouse through
having given way to the promptings of poesy. We knew a case of a poor
boy who soared on the wings of a conundrum into the Temple of Fame,
and out of the Inner Temple, where he held the situation of clerk to a
very promising junior barrister. Avoid the printer as you would the
devil; and eschew the Pierian Spring as you would the plug, when the
water is rushing fiercely out of it.
Having given a few directions for the
let us look at some of the particular
applicable to each of the various classes.
The first clerk of all is the Government Clerk, whose situation is the
most difficult of all; for the filling up of the office-hours from ten till
four will require a great amount of ingenuity. The newspaper will
furnish conversation, and, in the early part of the month, the magazines
will afford light reading that will be a relief to the dreadful monotony of
doing nothing. . It need hardly be suggested, that if a stranger should
enter, he must be received with a stare and a yawn, while some of the
old authorities recommend the whistling of a popular air from the last
Inew opera.
The Bank Clerk differs from the Government Clerk apparently, rather
than essentially. If an individual enters with a cheque to be changed,
i. of all clerks in general,
inds, and set down a few rules
be sure not to raise your eyes from a desk at which you are engaged,
in drawing some figures on a pad, probably for your own amusement;
and if you are laughing or joking with a fellow-clerk, do not cut short a
good story to attend to an impatient fellow who comes to pay in or draw
out money.
Railway Clerks are next in importance, and they should endeavour to
show their dignity by declining to speak to any one who addresses them.
If information is wanted, there are the printed bills to afford it; for the
duty of the Railway Clerk is confined to taking the fares, and giving the
tickets. If you are in this situation, you should not make yourself too
cheap, and you should therefore only be visible a few minutes before the
starting of the train, when, as a crowd will have been waiting impa-
tiently for you for some time, you will be sure at least of a welcome.
Always give the tickets very slowly; for as patience is a virtue, you
should take every opportunity of teaching others to practise it.
We now come to Law Clerks, who are divided into Articled Clerks,
Attorneys' Clerks, and the Clerks of Barristers.
Articled Clerks, who have paid a good premium, may imitate those in
the government offices to a certain extent; but they must be guided by
discretion, for people will not always put up with airs from any one in an
attorney's office.
The Copying Clerk can only enhance his dignity by using the word WE
when speaking of the firm, and talking of his principal to other clerks as
So and So, without the complimentary prefix of Mister to his surname.
The poor fellow may also flirt with the house-servant, in the hope of
getting an occasional draught of small beer or a hunch of bread and
cheese when he pops down into the kitchen.
We have now nothing left but the Barrister's Clerk, who derives his
consequence or the reverse from the standing at the bar or the utter
brieflessness of his employer. A Barrister's Clerk should never expose
the professional secrets of his master; but if a client should come with
even a simple motion of course, the clerk should search a large book
containing an imaginary list to see whether We—for the Barrister's
Clerk usually says We—are retained for the other side. If you have
nothing to do at chambers, you may endorse some dummies with tre-
mendous ideal fees in very large figures, and write in a very legible hand
“WITH You, MR. Attorney-GENERAL,” or “Consultation AT THE
Solicitor-GENERAL’s CHAMBERs at Six,” and these should be left lying
in such a position that every one who comes into the chambers cannot
avoid seeing them. If your master's practice is so notoriously nominal
that this “dodge” could not by any possibility succeed, you, who are his
clerk, will probably be a boy, and you will require juvenile recreation.
For this purpose there is the whole of the Temple, where pitch-and-toss
may be played at all reasonable hours with any other juvenile clerk who
may be disposed for the pastime alluded to.
One of the greatest accomplishments of a Barrister's Clerk consists in
knowing how to shirk attendance at chambers, and what notices placed
on the door are the best adapted to lull suspicion. “Return in an hour” is
a standard rule in all cases of vagueness, for the chance of your coming
back is so void for remoteness, that few would come to test the validity of
the document at the time when you have made yourself returnable.
“Gone to Westminster” looks extremely well upon the door, and may
apply to your master as well as to yourself. So that when you know he is
either fishing or shooting in the country, and is sure not to come back and
find you out, you may put up the notice alluded to with credit to all
parties.
Epigram.
SAYsAINsworth to Colburn,
“A plan in my pate is,
To give my romance, as
A supplement, gratis.”
Says Colburn to AINsworth,
“'Twill do very nicely.
For that will be charging

: LEGAL RETRIBUTION.
CoNsiderABLE sensation has been excited among that happily limited
portion of the bar which comprises attorney, counsel, clerk, and client,
all in one, by the unceremonious disrobing of one of the crew, which the
Benchers of Gray's Inn have very properly resorted to. The learned
individuals who hang about the outskirts of the Old Bailey, extending
their bags for briefs, and holding out their wigs in the hope of getting
fees thrown into them, have been subjected to a heavy blow and great
discouragement. Self-instruction may be all very well in an educational
sense, but when a counsel begins instructing himself, the transaction is
sure to be dubious. We are delighted at the determination of the
Benchers of Gray's Inn to keep the forensic bombazin unsullied, and the
white cravat of the Courts completely spotless. The wig of the advocate
ought not to be even suspected, lest he bring down the legal horse-hair
in shame and sorrow to the grave.

INspite of the rumours that Vauxhall Gardens are going to be built
upon.; that a crescent is to take the place of the orchestra; that a line of
street to be called Supper-Box Buildings is to run along one side; while
Rotunda Row is to occupy the other, on the ground where the Rotunda
now rears its proud papier máché chandelier: in spite, too, of a report
that the Hermit is to be knocked down by public auction; that the lamps
are to be submitted to the hammer; and that the British Crown done in wire
will become the property of any Pretender; while the large illumination
anchor is doomed to take its place in a collection of marine stores :-not-
withstanding all this, we find that the royal property is once more in all
its glory—with its five million additional lamps, its fireworks on an
increased scale of brilliancy, and its grand galas embracing everything
and everybody that was ever before seen, imagined, or heard of.
By the way, it would make a very tidy sum in arithmetic to compute
the number of lamps at present burning at Vauxhall Gardens, for as there
have been five million additional occasionally clapped on, the lamps must
have by this time reached an amount that would have kept that calcu-
lating old cock, Cocken, continually adding up to get a correct notion of.
As five million additional lamps are to the year 1830, so is 1845; or, “to
put the syllogism thus,” as SIR Bulwer Lytton says, if Vauxhall took
five million additional lamps fifteen years ago, and it has been going on at
the same rate ever since, what on earth will it all come to . But Vaux-
hall is open, and Punch has paid a visit to the royal property.
It is customary to observe that Vauxhall has all the peculiarities of
Fairy Land. If the fairies listen to brass bands and comic songs—if the
little elves eat lobster salad and drink arrack punch—if Puck and his
associates plunge into bottled porter with fowl and ham, then, but only
then, is Vauxhall invested with all the peculiarities of Fairy Land.
On entering the gardens, there arose amid the sylvan branches of the
lamp-lighted trees an old familiar voice, shrieking out some comic distich
on the subject of America. The name in the bill was not the name of
old, but the voice was the same. The comic singer at Vauxhall is the
comic singer at Vauxhall, and the buffo by any other name would be
equally welcome. The comic singer might actually be made up like a
medical prescription. Take a white waistcoat, put a man into it, add a
blue coat, garnish with white stock, flavour with brandy-and-water, stir
with music, and dish up to some popular tune, when you will have an
excellent Vauxhall comic singer. On nearing the orchestra, we found the
band still wearing those old traditional cocked-hats, which have travelled
from pole to pole for the last hundred years. Some of them were, of
course, too large, and that of the double-bass advanced so far on to the
bridge of his nose, as to have completely excluded from his eyes all sight
of the bridge of his instrument. The flute, on the other hand, could
hardly keep his hat on, in consequence of its being too small for him; and
if Nature's band of wind instruments commenced playing some gentle

airs, the perplexed musician was obliged to remove his fingers from the
stops of his flute to stop his hat, which would otherwise have executed a
capriccio movement.
Having listened to the Vocal Concert, which was of the usual musico-
lºſiº character, including a slice of comic, or ham, between two
bits of sentiment, or bread and butter, we hurried away at the sound of
the bell to see the Ballet. This was so beautiful, yet so unintelligible;
there was such a quantity of white muslin and dark mystery, so ingeniously
blended together, that we took down the following to serve to future
visitors of Vauxhall as the,
-ibretto of the Ballet.
The scene represents a vast African Desert, with a vase on one side,
and a rout-seat, partially covered with red calico, on the other. Some
maidens, in muslin, are expressing their joy and innocence in a dance of
six, when a young Emir or Pacha, of about fifteen years of age, in a
Persian turban, a Richard the Third's robe, and a Greek jacket over
that, throws himself on to the rout-chair, in a state of evident despon-
dency. His Grand Vizier, in a sort of German tunic, made of green
baize, trimmed with door leather, endeavours to console him by showing
him the six innocent maidens in white muslin, who come up to him one by
one, with the right leg poised in the air, as much as to say by the expres-
sion of the foot—What do you think of me? He disdains the innocent
creatures with much rudeness, and once more throws himself on to the
rout-seat, and buries his head in his hands—a species of funeral solemnity
which is perfectly natural. At length a fair creature enters in a Polish
head-dress and British petticoats, a body of pink Persian, generally used
for lining, and a skirt of book muslin. She capers up to the young Emir
with much activity, and smiles benignantly on the audience, when the
Emir examines her features; but drawing his hand down his face, and
mournfully shaking his head—a gesture expressive of his wanting some-
thing a shade or two lovelier—he repairs once more to his rout-seat,
while his Grand Vizier “draws a one side,” as the cabmen say, and the
young innocent in demi-Polish costume is joined by a real red satin Pole,
with whom she commences dancing the Polka—the Emir looking on with
a sort of melancholy patience which is truly praiseworthy.
The Polka being concluded—in the course of which the Emir is several
times obliged to put his feet under his seat to prevent them from being
trodden on, and the Vizier is frequently flung violently back by the boister-
ous gyrations of the joyous couple—the Polka being at an end, the Emir
appears doomed to finish his life, or at least the ballet, in single cursed-
ness, when a faun-like thing in shamefully short petticoats comes frisking
along, and the Emir is evidently struck “all of a heap” by the brilliance
of her rouge, the chalky whiteness of her skin, and the more than Indian

inkiness of her eyebrows. He is suited at last, and retires to the rout-seat
to witness a dance; when a Greek youth advances, in a state of slavery,
which is shown by a chain of most considerate lightness passing from one
hand to the other. A few appealing pirouettes from the maiden soften the
Emir's heart, and the fetters are taken by the Grand Vizier from the
youth's hands, when a pas de caractère commences, in the course of which
the Emir and his Grand Vizier disappear—the latter taking the rout-seat
in his hand. The pas de love and gratitude having terminated, an indi-
vidual enters in a suit of black, accompanied by MR. CANFIELD, the Ame-
rican SAMson, who breaks cables into little bits, gives a back at leap-frog
to a cannon which is let off, and lifts three or four men, among whom we
distinctly recognised the Grand Vizier. What has become of the Emir
during all this time does not appear, but it is supposed that he abdicates
the rout-seat of power, and is succeeded either by the youth and maiden
who danced the Polka, or by the other youth and maiden who danced the
pas de caractère, and it is probable that the introduction of the strong
man was intended to show that force was necessary to alter and settle the
dynasty. Such was the Vauxhall ballet, as far as we, without the aid of
a book, could follow out its incidents, and we trust that our attempt to
provide a libretto will be duly appreciated.
Understanding that there was an attempt to realise Vesuvius in a
corner of the gardens, we inquired of a waiter the way to Naples, and
ascertained that we should find the celebrated bay by taking the first
turning on the left after the last supper-box. We were soon gazing on a
Neapolitan sea-scape under a Vauxhall sky, and it was only a slight dif-
ference in climate, with a powerful odour of punch, that made us re-
member we were not at Napoli. Vesuvius was smoking mildly, as if the
demon of the mount were in the act of enjoying a cigar after dinner.
After shedding a tear—just one—over the fate of PLINY, we hurried along
the dark walk, at the end of which is a splendid allegorical representation
of NEPTUNE laying on the water to all parts of the world through the
nostrils of some horses, made of plaster of Paris.
We beg leave to call the attention of the Commissioners of Woods and
Forests to this splendid group, which would be a vast improvement on
the Fountains in Trafalgar Square, if a swap could be effected. Turning
smartly to the left, we came upon the well-known Hermit, whose position
is lively and social compared with that of the real hermit—the miserable
wretch who is compelled to remain in attendance all night, for the purpose
of keeping the moon perpetually snuffed, and poking or trimming the
hermit’s fire.
The mind turns anxiously from the darkness of the Vauxhall Hermit's
cell to the brilliance of the Vauxhall fireworks. To describe the latter
would be impossible. The enthusiastic “Oh's 1” the enraptured “Ah's 1”
the universal “My's 1" and occasional “Lookee there's 1” not only beggar
description, but reduce him to a state of hopeless insolvency. The rapid
descent of Joel Il Diavolo along a wire, with a firework fizzing from the
end of his nose, and a blaze of brilliancy pouring out from his elbows,
must be seen not to be understood, and witnessed in order to be utterly
indescribable.
Of WIDDIcon B we say nothing. There are some subjects too serious
to be joked upon, and WIDDIcomb, at Vauxhall, is one With this
mournful piece of philosophy, we bring our notice to a close,
TEE DUSTY STREETS.
--"
* Down with the dust,” is now the universal cry; and we are happy to
find that an association has been formed to employ 40,000 able-bodied
men in scouring the town instead of leaving them to scour the country in
idleness and poverty. The complaint of the individual who hires a gig
on Sunday, and cannot cut a dash because the dust completely envelopes
him, has at last been heard; and a great sweeping reform is in progress,
by which 40,000 men will daily sweep the great London thoroughfares.
*āIt seems, from the statistics of sweeping, that one man can keep clean
an area of upwards of a thousand yards; and it is ascertained that
twenty-six into Fleet-street will go once and two over; while a broom
and a half per man will be about the average of the consumption of
besoms. A public meeting has already been held on this great question;
and we can only say that it has Punch's finest sympathy.

THE AFFLUENT.-A young gentleman, who from a habit of
dining out at parties, has acquired a taste for Champagne and other expensive
wines, but whose means, alas! do not admit of his indulging in the same at his own
expense, makes this earnest appeal to the benevolent and kind-hearted, in the hope
that, through their liberality, his small but too empty cellar may be supplied. Even
single bottles would be most thankfully received.—Please to address to the Hon.

LONG DURATION OF SLEEP.
The trance under which MR. BARRY has been labouring for weeks
ast, still continues as bad as ever. He passed a very restless day on
º. owing to the noise made by the incessant firing at the review in
Hyde Park. PRINCE ALBERT has been unremitting in his inquiries;
and strict orders have been given by his Royal Highness that MR. BARRY,
as long as he continues in É. present hopeless state, is not to be dis-
turbed by anybody.
LoRD BRough AM called in the course of the week, but was instantly
denied. His Lordship left word that he would look in again shortly, as
he was most anxious to know how MR. BARRY was getting on. MR.
BARRY is still quartered at the new Houses of Parliament, it being the
spot where his singular complaint first began. Should there be no signs
of improvement, however—that is to say, of his getting rapidly wide-
awake—there is a loud talk of removing him.
Princely Precaution.
It is rumoured that Louis-PHILIPPE is in treaty with the proprietor of
the Electric Gun for the purchase of the secret of its construction ; for,
since the statement has been published that it discharges 1,000 balls a
minute, His MAJESTY has been most anxious to get the gun into his own
hands, lest its deadly powers should ever be tried upon some of the finest
buildings in France, particularly the fortifications of Paris. . Should the
secret be bought up, we advise His FRENch MAJESTY to have boards
set up the whole length of the enceinte continuée, with the inscription of
“Electric Guns set on these premises.” It will effectually save his
subjects the shame of any more “glorious” days of July.
LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
SoME surprise has been excited in legal circles that the promotions have
not included our friend MR. BRIEFLEss. It was confidently expected
that the coif would have been pressed upon him, or that his stuff gown—
now nearly worn out with constantly sitting down, for he is never on his
legs—would have been replaced by a silk one. We are told that MR.
BRIEFLEss intends bringing his case under the notice of the public in a
pamphlet to be called Who, When, Why, and What, addressed to the
LoRD CHANCELLOR.

Wilt thou that naughty, fluttering heart resign?
Cather:NE my own sweet KATE I wilt thou be mine?
Thou shalt have pearls to deck thy raven hair–
Thou shalt have all this world of ours can bring;
And we will live in solitude, nor care
For aught save for each other. We will fling
Away all sorrow—Eden shall be there :
And thou shalt be my queen, and I thy king:
Still coy, and still reluctant? Sweetheart, say,
When shall we monarchs be? and which the day?

PAINFUL TOYS.
DEAR PUNCH,
I want to know whether you think, any moral or intellectual
good can be done to the world łł species of toy that I now see in many
of the shops, and which is something like this:— .
Two pieces of board are fitted together with a piece of leather at the
edges, and when these are pressed together, the air goes through a hole
with a noise resembling the word “fitch " The figure on the outside
represents a young gentleman suspended from some railings by the seat
of his “continuations,” and, by a curious arrangement, his mouth opens
whenever the noise is produced. Sometimes the figure represents a
sportsman with his foot in a trap; sometimes a man having a tooth
extracted ; but all agree in this point, that the squeak of the boards is
intended for an expression of pain by the party depicted outside.
Now, sir, I look upon these toys highly objectionable.
First, from a moral point of view, as I think a constant exhibition of
pain anything but wholesome to the young mind.
Secondly, from an intellectual point of view, as I assure you no human
being in pain ever uttered a noise like that of this little machine. I
recently tried the experiment on my six sons, to whom I gave in succes-
sion a smart pinch. The first growled out—“Come now " the second
exclaimed, “I say " the third ejaculated, “Oh, crikey!” the fourth,
whistled “Phew "the fifth uttered “Oh ſ* alone, and the sixth and
yºungest, sat down and bellowed like a bull. Not one of them, Mr.
Punch, said anything like the monosyllable “fitch.”
Pray, Punch, if you agree with me, insert this letter as some check to
the propagation of error.
PATERFAMILIAs.
MIKE GIBBS AND BILLY GIBBS.
Tº Lºnd Mayon was placed in an awkward situation the other day
by the fºllowing burst of honest indignation from the lips of a policeman,
at the Mansion-house;-- º ---
“My lord, this Billy Gibbs is one of the worst characters we are
acquainted with, and I should be glad to know whether I am not at
liberty to apprehend him in this case.” , -
Whether it was tenderness towards a namesake, or for some other
cause, we know not; but certain it is, that MIKE Gibbs would not
sanction the apprehension of Billy Gibbs: “for,” said the Lond Mayoh,
“I cannot see any ground for apprehending Billy Gibbs in the present
case ; but...as he is a person of such desperate character, he must in
all probability soon fall into the hands of the police.”
Mike Gibbs thinks there is no occasion for Billy Gibbs to be brought -
to boºk at present. His time will come some day or other, and so there
is to be no hurry. Mike Gibbs disapproves of Billy Gibbs being called
o account just at present.
lºngland's wooden walls.
A RAlling is being put up round the Wellington Statue opposite the
Royal Exchange. The shabby boarding, however, still continues round
the Nelson Column. We think, after the handsome present of the
EMPEROR of Russia, they might have bound this work of art in something
better than plain boards. . A column does not improve, any more than
good wine, by being kept too long “in the wood.” We certainly take a
pride in giving the column this railing-because we feel, that, if it is
left to the public, it will never get one. The Committee, too, we think,
requires blowing up just as much as the boards.
TREMENDOUS SUFFERINGS of THE HOUSEHOLD BRIGADE.

“THE Household BRIGADE.-On the 1st of July the 1st Life Guards will march
from Regent's Park to Hyde Park; the 2nd Life Guards from Hyde Park to Windsor;
and the Royal Horse Guards from Windsor to Regent's Park.”

everybody was looking like a bad wax-candle, you could walk about,

were to live together for a thousand years to come—what are you
clasping your hands at –a thousand years to come I say, I shall never
forget your conduct this day. You could go to the other end of the ship
and smoke a cigar, when you knew I should be ill—oh, you knew
it ; for I always am. The brutal way, too, in which you took that
cold brandy-and-water—you thought I didn't see you; but ill as I
was, hardly able to hold my head up, I was watching you all the
time. Three glasses of cold brandy-and-water; and you sipped 'em,
and drank the health of people you didn't care a pin about ; whilst
the health of your own lawful wife was nothing. Three glasses of
brandy-and-water, and I left—as I may say—alone ! You didn't hear
'em, but everybody was crying shame of you.

MR. CAUDLE ; it’s a good thing for you that I know a little more of
the value of money than that.
“But, of course, you were better engaged than attending to me.
MR. PRETTYMAN came on board at Gravesend. A planned thing,
of course. You think I didn't see him give you a letter. It wasn't a
letter; it was a newspaper? I daresay ; ill as I was, I had my eyes. It
was the smallest newspaper I ever saw, that's all. But of course, a

out in that manner, I’ll get up. Do you forget that you’re not at

we shall have the landlord up ! And you could smoke and drink

That's nothing to do with it. Yes; forward. What a pity that
Miss PRETTYMAN wasn't with you. I'm sure nothing could be too
forward for her. No, I won't hold my tongue; and I ought not to be
ashamed of myself. It isn't treason, is it, to speak of Miss PRETTY-
MAN ? After all I’ve suffered to-day, and I’m not to open my lips 1
Yes; I'm to be brought away from my own home, dragged down
here to the sea-side, and made ill; and I’m not to speak. I should
like to know what next.
“It’s a mercy that some of the dear children were not drowned ;
not that their father would have cared, so long as he could have had
his brandy and cigars. Peter was as near through one of the holes
as—It’s no such thing? It's very well for you to say so, but you

again. Go to sleep, indeed as if one could never have a little
rational conversation. No, I shan’t be too late for the Margate boat
in the morning; I can wake up at what hour I like, and you ought
to know that by this time.
“A miserable creature they must have thought me in the ladies’
cabin, with nobody coming down to see how I was. You came a dozen
times? No, CAUDLE, that won't do. I know better. You never
came at all. Oh, no cigars and brandy took all your attention.
And when I was so ill, that I didn't know a single thing that
was going on about me, and you never came. Every other woman's
husband was there—ha! twenty times. And what must have been
my feelings to hear 'em tapping at the door, and making all sorts of
kind inquiries—something like husbands !—and I was left to be ill
alone? Yes; and you want to get me into an argument. You want
to know, if I was so ill that I knew nothing, how could I know that
you didn't come to the cabin-door That’s just like your aggra-
vating way; but I’m not to be caught in that manner, CAUDLE. No.”
“It is very possible,” writes CAUDLE, “that she talked two hours
more : but, happily, the wind got suddenly up—the waves bellowed
—and, soothed by the sweet lullaby (to say nothing of the Dolphin's
brandy-and-water) Isomehow fell asleep.”
A Word in Season.
Notwithstanding—indeed we should rather say in consequence of
the heat of the weather, ice in large quantities is to be met with in every
street, at various pastry-cooks. It is to be wished that the Humane
Society, or somebody, would have these places marked “Dangerous,” for
the especial benefit of young ladies, who frequently hurt themselves by
venturing too often on the ice.

WHY I SHALL NOT SEND MY SON, GUSTAVUS FREDERIC,
TO TRINITY COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE.
By Mr. Punch.
The young men of Trinity. College, Cambridge, assume greater rank
than the members of other colleges in that University. They wear blue
gowns while other youths wear black; they number more noblemen and
fellow-commoners than all the University put together; they call all the
rest of the world “small college-men.” Old LickspitTLE, from Baker
Street, sends Young Lickspittle to Trinity that he may form “connec-
tions” there, and become acquainted with sucking lords, with whom he
may walk down Pall Mall in after life.
And yet, from accounts which reach me, I won’t send my son Gus-
Tavus FREDERic ForresTER CHESTERFIELD D'ORsay Punch to Trinity;
I wish Gustavus FREDERic to see good society, certainly, but not at such
a price as he must pay under DR. WHEwell's Mastership.
Suppose DR. Whewell, were to take a fancy to that dear child, as I
have no doubt he would ; he would invite him to the lodge to tea, which
is a very wholesome drink for my darling boy. But he would not be
allowed to sit down and drink it. No ; The MASTER of TRINITY DoEs
Nor ALLow UNDERGRADUATEs to sIT Down BEFore HIM. If a raw lad dares
to take a chair, there's a kind sub-tutor in the way, who whispers to the
young gentleman this wish of the master.
I wouldn't have my Gustavus FREDER1c go into any company where he
is considered unworthy to sit down. His legs are strong, but I won't
have them tried in that way.
Even when I see ladies and gentlemen standing behind PRINCE ALBERT
and HER MAJESTY, I blush. To be a flunky after all is not an honour-
able position—to be a flunky and stand behind even a Queen. I pity the
poor devils of White Rods and Aides-de-camp when I see them at the
Opera, and the Prince in his chair. I feel ashamed somehow.
And if ashamed of a gentleman standing before a prince, how much
more of a gentleman standing before a DR. WHEwell —The Doctor has
written a Bridgewater treatise, and I'm sure only acts from humility;
it is for his office sake, and not for his own, that he degrades young
ntlemen so; and I've no doubt when HER MAJESTY was at Trinity
i. he gave the QUEEN his arm, or walked before her, as Doctor
Busby did before KING CHARLEs. But my beloved boy's proud spirit
would burst over the lodge muffins and tea, if obliged to swallow them
standing. He has not been accustomed to take his victuals in that way;
no, nor to stand before any person—not even his own father.
And suppose I were to go down to see him. His tutor would ask me
to dine in the hall, no doubt, as MR. S.– asked MR. JERDAN and a
party the other day. Doctor WHEweLL sees a party of distingué-
looking fellows dining with MR. S.–, and inviteshimand his friends to the
lodge. But he hears that in the party is a literary gentleman by the name of
Punch, on which the Master writes a letter, to say—“Dear S., I expect
all your party earcept Mr. Punch.” DR. WHEwell did this the other
day to the editor of another eminent literary periodical.
Suppose such a thing were to happen to me, what would Gustavus
FREDERic do? What would I do? I might be angry. I might use
strong language. I shudder to think what I might say or do.
Neither of us can afford to mix with good society at that price; and
therefore, as long as the Master of Trinity maintains his present opinions,
GUSTAvus FREDERic shall be a small college-MAN.

If the Eureka can really do what it professes to do, and put words

LAST Sunday a scene occurred at this favoured spot, a scene unparal-
leled in the memories of the oldest butcher and baker. Half London
having emptied itself into the town, neither bite nor sup was to be had
after l P. M. Five shillings were freely offered—so thronged was the
F. a three-legged stool; and door-steps had lively purchasers at
alf-a-crown the fourteen inches. We saw many respectable families
seated on the hot pavement; and being under a vertical sun, were in
many instances heard as if slowly grilling.
Ginger-beer never went up so in the memory of man ; rising per bottle
as high as three shillings.
The heads and tails of shrimps went at two-and-sixpence a pint.
We are informed—though we do not vouch for the truth of the report
—that three mice were sold at eighteenpence a-piece, and cooked for a
stockbroker.
A pious and respectable family were detected breaking into the larder
of the rector. We are not yet at liberty to give their names.
An Italian boy sold a live tortoise for a sovereign, to make mock-turtle
for a common councilman.
Pigeons were pelted with five shilling pieces, and in several instances
brought dead to the ground, and broiled on the flags.
A very respectable bald-headed attorney, happily having some parch-
ment deeds about him, soaked them in brandy-and-water (which he
providentially carried in a pocket-pistol), and then divided them among
his exhausted family; thereby unconsciously, but no less beautifully,
realising the fable of the pelican feeding with its own blood its own little
ones.
There were other cases of equal horror; but out of decent respect to
the sensibilities of our readers, we reluctantly suppress them.
Eindred Spirits.
SoME persons are fond of comparing QUEEN VicroRIA with QUEEN
Elizabeth. In one point the resemblance is perfect—and that is, the
patronage of both for the English Drama. The age of ElizaBETH pro-
duced a WILLIAM Shakspere—that of WicroRIA is already immortal
with the name of ALFRED BUNN But let Her Majesty only persevere
in her frequent visits to the French plays, and her name will assuredly
go down to posterity with those of ScRIBE, St. GeoRGEs, DUMAs, LEUvEN,
and BRUNswick—names far surpassing in lustre those of Ford, BEAUMont
and Fletcher, MARLowe, and BEN Jonson, which only throw a rushlight
glow on the reign of ElizaBETH.
LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
THE statement as to the office of Advocate-General at Bengal having
been declined by eight learned gentlemen at the bar, has created a very
considerable sensation in the back-rows of Westminster Hall; and a distin-
guished stuff gown has sent in a tender to the government, with a sample
of his eloquence, comprising a speech delivered at the Old Bailey in a
celebrated murder case. . It is whispered that there are political reasons
for not offering the appointment to MR. BRIEFLEss, who is going about
calling himself a blighted flower.

36 - PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
M I L I TA R Y MOV E M E N T S.
HERE has lately been a change of barracks on the part of two fine
cavalry regiments, which have hitherto been quartered, one in Albany
Street, Regent's Park, and the other at Knightsbridge. Informer times
the soldiery divided themselves equally between love and glory, so
that, in the old operas, if we find a military man among the dramatis
personae, he is continually giving as the cue to the orchestra, “Farewell
glory, welcome love!” or “Farewell love, welcome glory !” as either the one
or the other becomes the burden of his ditty. But with the modern
horseguard there has been for some time past no opportunity for glory, so
love has entirely possessed itself of some three or four regiments of cavalry,
whose “stern alarums” have been “changed to merry meetings” at the
nearest public-house, and whose “frightful marches” have been superseded.
by “delightful measures,” including the pot, the pint, and the quartern.
In fact for some time, instead of “mounting barbed steeds to fright the
souls of fearful adversaries,” they have been “capering nimbly” in
some landlord's chamber “to the lascivious pleasing” of a cracked
piano-forte. -
But the object of our present remarks is to point out the fearful effect
of a sudden removal of a regiment from a spot where it has twined itself
round the young hearts, and bound itself up among the gushing affections
of the cooks, the housemaids, the nurses, and the servants of all work of
an entire district. If “the heart that has truly loved never forgets,”
what in the name of constancy is to become of a fair thing who has
centred all her affections on a gallant trooper, whom stern fate, and the
still sterner War Office, may have clutched away at the moment when
the bud of flirtation was just blowing into the full blossom of an asking
in church, and a contingent chance of future wedlock.
We understand that the condition of Albany Street is truly deplorable.

The departure from the Barracks was one of the most touching scenes
that was ever witnessed. Cooks that had stood fire amid the broiling heat
of a hundred chops were melted to tears; and the housemaids, who had
scoured bed-rooms without a pang, could think of nothing but scouring
: country, and if necessary the whole world, in pursuit of their soldier
oves.
We would just suggest to the authorities at the War Office, that in the
future regulations of the movements of the soldiery, it would be as well to
consider the effect of a too sudden bursting of the bonds of affection, and
a too rapid severing in twain of the ties that bind the female heart to the
jack-boots and helmets of our splendid cavalry. In one case, a regiment
has actually been sent as far as Windsor, so that the gulf between lovely
: woman and her horseguard, appears almost impassable.
We are sorry to add that the soldiers themselves do not appear to:
participate in the sorrow of the “girls they leave behind them,” but
seem on the contrary rather pleased at the prospect of meeting the girls :
they find before them. “How sad it is,” to use the philosophic words of
a calmly resigned cook, whose wages and perquisites have successfully
struggled in her breast against her more tender feelings, “How sad it is:
that the steel breastplate which gives a brilliancy to the outer man, should
impart a coldness to his inmost heart—and that the cuirass of the
soldier should be, not a cuirass, but a curse, to the confiding creature who
resigns her affections into the hands of an Oxford Blue or a Life Guards-
man º' With this beautiful piece of melancholy reflection we close our
remarks on this most affecting subject.

PURIFYING COVENT GARDEN THEATRE.
“THE cause of this removal from their (the Brussels troupe) former quarters, it is generally understood, is the fact that the connexion of Covent
Garden with the Anti-Corn Law League was a bar to the patronage of HER MAJESTY.”—Times, July 5.

TIIE QUEEN AND THE CORN LAWS.
Ictonia, our GRAcious MAJEsty,
has withdrawn her counte-
nance from Covent Garden
Theatre. It is a doomed, bad
house: its character as a re-
spectable mass of bricks and
stucco gone for ever, in conse-
quence of the naughty people
—the Anti-Corn Law Leaguers
—who have held their revels
there. Thus, the Court, fear-
s ing to catch free-trade prin-
tº ciples—as folks catch typhus
from foul buildings—attends
at that unpolluted temple of
taste and genius, Drury Lane,
ordering thither the Brussels
nightingales. We trust that
the custode of that pure fane, the
poet Bunn, will be knighted;
—that the glitter of his spurs
may, if possible, cast a still
brighter lustre on the building
in which his genius has already
lighted many blazes of triumph.
For the greater the glory of the
Lane, the blacker the shadow
on the Garden. The League
was “a great fact;” a stirring
giant, with a hundred brawny
arms, shaking the pillars of monopoly. , Alas! it is now gone—
defunct: a mass of dead clay, “brained with a lady's fan.”
All signal and soul-striking as is the visitation of HER MAJEsty's
displeasure on that dumb, dead playhouse—that cold carcase of a
tenement, Covent Garden—still do we think it insufficient to the
punishment of the crime of which it has been guilty. Any other
bricks of any other building would have felt the rebuke like bricks,
and have tumbled into a heap of ruins, smitten by the whirl of the
royal carriage wheels, as they rolled towards triumphant Drury. The
exterior reliero figures would have blushed a deeper red than was
ever yet flaunted in the inside saloons. But no There is some-
thing strangely hardening in a playhouse : for even bricks and
statues become harder and harder still, exposed to its indurating
atmosphere.
Nevertheless, we would have the whole of the theatre demolished,
carried away; and to commemorate the defeat of the League and the
triumph of the Corn Laws, we would have the site turned up by the
plough, and then sown with the very best British wheat. A very
imposing spectacle might be made of the ceremony. Sure we are,
that to teach so great a moral lesson, the DUKE of Rich Mon D–the
farmer's friend—would have no objection to throw the grain broad-
cast. We can picture him—the homely, out-speaking Duke, the
starred-and-gartered ADAM of the soil—dressed for the occasion in a
smock-frock of white satin, with amber-coloured smalls of the same
web. A few Young Englanders with oaten pipes and silver crooks
might also attend as shepherds.
Nor would we end here. We would have all the actors and
actresses—who at any period of their lives had formed a part of
Covent Garden company—sought out and punished; so that the
sins of the bricks might be visited upon those who, at one time or
the other, had kept them company. MR. CHARLEs KEMBLE has,
we believe, an interest in Covent Garden. MR. CHARLEs KEMBLE's
son John is the Deputy Licenser of Plays. Let him be immediately
degraded. Hitherto the Covent Garden Theatrical Fund has re-
ceived an annual subscription from HER MAJEsty's purse of 100l.
Of course this donation can never again be repeated. No : we would
have the warning and punishment complete and terrible. If bricks ºf
and mortar be thus significantly reproved, why should men and
women escape Let equal magnanimity chastise all alike.
In the meantime, we would suggest that the Lord CHAMBER-
LAIN should for at least an hour a day walk Bow Street, bearing a
paper lantern—made out of the Court Circular that announced the
royal visit to Drury Lane—with an inscription underneath showing
these awful words:– “Beware of an Anti-Corn Law House !”
TAILOR'S LATIN.”
We all owe much to our tailor in one sense; many of us in more senses
than one. How shall society repay its tailor! At least, by elevating him
in the social scale. Let his art rank henceforth among the liberal pro-
fessions. Why prefer the individual who gilds a pill to him who clothes
a man Educate the tailor, not to that limited extent which would simply
give him the schoolboy knowledge of what is Latin for goose, but so as to
place him on a level with the apothecary. Tailors' Latin, we doubt not,
would be as good as doctors' Latin. Let gentlemen prescribe their clothes
instead of ordering them. As—
R. Super-Saxoniae Opt:
Valenciae Qualitate Praestant:
Alberti Mist: a a quant: suff.
Fiant tunica, subucula, braccaeque laxae, horá prandii gerend:
Part of a preliminary examination at Merchant Tailors'. Hall might
consist in causing the student to translate such prescriptions, as, for
instance, the above, thus:-
Take, of Best Super-Saxony,
of Fine Valencia, -
of Albert Mixture, each, a sufficient quantity.
Let a coat, a waistcoat, and trousers be made, to be worn at
dinner-time.
But while we would exalt the tailor, would we allow the milliner to
remain where she is Certainly not. For an artist who is to execute
classic drapery, what can be better than classical instruction 1. The
father, the husband, the brother, may prescribe ladies' dresses; whereby
economy will be consulted as well as elegance. As thus:-
R. Serici Coerulei Virgas vijj
Taeniarum Coccin: Virg: v.
Ut fiat vestis, secundum artem, rosis elegantër ornata, quâ se
vesperibus adolescentula induat.
That is to say, young ladies—
Take, of Blue Silk, eight yards,
of Crimson Ribbons, five yards.
So that a dress may be made, according to art, elegantly trimmed
with roses, which let the damsel put on of evenings.
And let us say, in conclusion, that a physician would often find this
prescription most serviceable in cases of low spirits and ill-humour; very
many of which we will lay a heavy wager that it will relieve. . .

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH's GUIDE To servaNTs.
THE FOOTMAN.
a HE FootMAN, in the present age of false
appearances, should be like one of
those patent articles that serve
several purposes at once; such as
a chair that pulls out and forms a
bed, or shuts up and looks like a
chest of drawers, or lets down and
makes an ottoman, or sinks in and
constitutes a packing-case, or falls
down at the sides and serves for a
sofa, or opens with a hinge and acts
as a pair of library-steps, or tumbles
to pieces—as it often will—and
comes to nothing.
In our present Guide we do not
address ourselves to the pure foot-
man, but to the general flunky prac-
titioner. We have not the gold-
headed cane in our eye, nor shall we
tie ourselves down to the shoulder-
knot; but we shall address ourselves to that admirable domestic CRichton,
the man-servant who is “willing to make himself generally useful.”
The footman of this class is a sort of man of all work, who must have
been accustomed to boot-cleaning, plate-polishing, waiting at table, cow-
milking, the care of a horse, mat-beating, driving one or a pair, the
management of bees, French-polishing furniture, making bread, cleaning
windows, looking after poultry, brewing, gardening, rearing, feeding, and
killing pigs, pickling pork, trimming lamps, and cutting bread-and-butter.
If he has been used to all these things a little, and to some of them a good
deal—if he is willing to try his hand at anything that does not imme-
diately lie within the scope of these accomplishments—if he has a good
temper and a respectable calf—if he will find himself in white Berlin
gloves, tea and sugar, and overalls, he may stand a chance of getting
a place as footman in a genteel, and perhaps even in a serious family.
But it is not everything to know how to get through the duties of which
we have given a catalogue; for there are numerous other accomplish-
ments necessary, without which all the rest would go for nothing. The
things we have enumerated must not only be done, but they must be done
with so much tact and discretion, that visitors to the house should not be
aware that there is but one male servant on the establishment. A general
footman in a family should recollect that “all the world’s a stage,” and
that “each man in his time plays many parts,” the difference between
the footman and other people being, that while they play only one part at
a time, he has to play his all at once; so that, in fact, he is engaged con-
stantly in a species of monopolylogue, in which he sustains at the same
time about half-a-dozen different characters. He will also be required to
carry out the parallel of a monopolylogue, by frequently changing his
dress with great rapidity, and a little knowledge of ventriloquism would
be of use, to enable him to vary his voice, making it sound as if it came
i from two or three different rooms, and thus keeping up an illusion in the
minds of visitors that there are several male domestics in the establish-
ment. When acting as groom, it would be as well to adopt the voce di
petto, or chest voice, as being best adapted to the stable; while in the
drawing-room the voce di testa, or mild falsetto, should be resorted to. A
powerful command of the features and a collection of wigs, are also very
desirable adjuncts to a young man going into service as a general
footman ; for if he is quick at changing his dress, he may appear one
minute as a gardener, going round the garden with his master and his
guests, while the next moment he may be standing at the door of the
dining-room as an in-door servant in a suit of pepper-and-salt, worn, of
course, under his fustians and blue apron, which are slipped off with the
rapidity of the change of costume in a pantomime. This is pleasing to
the employer, for it gratifies his vanity by inducing his visitors to believe
that he has an efficient staff of male domestics, while in fact he is at the
expense of only one.
It is difficult to give particular rules for the guidance of a general foot-
man, as he must regulate his work according to circumstances. After
beating the mats, cleaning the boots, and rubbing down the horse, he
should slip off his fustians, and slip on a white apron with a clean striped
jacket, to appear in the breakfast-room. If he has to drive his master to
town, he should contrive to put the horse to while breakfast is going on ;
and by having his livery-coat and hat outside the door, he may manage to
announce the carriage as a butler, and be on the box as coachman, in a
complete change of costume, within an incredibly short period. On his
return he should put up his horse, and commence his duties as a
gardener; but he should be able to slip on his jacket and apron, with a
pair of Berlin gloves, to bring in the tray for luncheon; when he should
ask if there are any orders for the coachman, which he will receive in his
character of footman, and execute in his capacity of out-door servant.
He will probably have to fetch his master home ; so that he should wear
his pepper-and-salt trousers carefully concealed, by wrapping the box-coat
over his knees; and when he comes home, he has only to put on his
in-door coat to be at once a ready-made servant for waiting at dinner.
He must put up his horse before taking tea into the drawing-room; and
when the family have retired to rest, he can wash his carriage, clean his
harness, thoroughly groom his horse, and do any other little odd jobs, in
accordance with his engagement to make himself generally useful. He
must be up at daylight, to clean his boots, his knives, and his plate, to
beat his mats and brush his clothes, when he will have the satisfaction of
feeling that he is forward with his work, so that if he has any spare time
it will be at his own disposal.

Young Oxford is a fine young man,
As any you will see,
And eke the young Astyanax
Of his fond family.
So spruce a blade the livelong day
You scarce might hope to find :
He wears a shooting-jacket short,
With buttons low behind;
And round his neck a satin tie,
A tie of pattern large;
And in that tie a great round pin,
A pin of costly charge;
And in his mouth a mild cigar,
And in his hand a cane ; -
And at his heels a curly dog
With coat like lion's mane.
Young Oxford loves each afternoon,
To saunter in the High,
And deems he is the cynosure
Of every neighb'ring eye.
Young Oxford eats a wondrous meal,
And drinks a lot of beer,
And in the morning oftentimes
Full seedy does appear.
Young Oxford for his little-go
Gets plucked ; when rashly he
Gets drunk, and rusticated is
For terms, one, two, or three.
Young Oxford's father never back
His son to college sends;
And so he dies a natural death,
And so my story ends. OAA OE4'OPA.

The EMPEROR of Russia has just made his grandson, a young Prince
of three months old, a Colonel of the Imperial Guard.
Two Captains have been appointed to assist the young officer; MRs.
BiBski to dress him, and MRs. Tuckerwitz to nurse him.
The regiment has adopted the uniform of the Colonel, viz. long petti-
coats, lace cap, and the national cockade.
They look splendid in this uniform : though it rather impedes the
movements of the troops on field days.
The field officers of the regiment ride in superb go-carts.
Asplendid service of silver pap-boats has been presented by the Colonel's
Imperial Grandmother to the regimental mess.
When the Colonel cuts his first tooth he is to be advanced to the rank
of Major-General; when he is weaned he is to be made Field-Marshal.
A baton of barley-sugar is preparing for his Imperial Highness, and
the devoted subjects of the Emperor say he will make as good a Field-
Marshal as a certain eminent and Royal warrior, who enjoys the same
rank in this country; and who was seen at a late review reading the

EADING over the papers at this season of
the year, one is charmed at the quantity
of parental kindness to be met with in
the advertisements. It would seem that
England is gushing with fatherly and
motherly love from one end to the
º, other; while the suburbs appear to be
* particularly rich in tenderness towards
juveniles. The number of “happy
homes” within three miles of Hyde
Park Corner, must be seen to be con-
ceived; and the quantity of people
ready to bestow on young gentlemen
from three to eight, a vast amount of
maternal solicitude, the Supplement to
the Times can alone give a faint con-
ception of. Parental care at five pounds
a quarter, without extras, is liberally
streaming down the columns of all the
newspapers; and, in some cases, affec-
tionate superintendence of mind and
morals is offered in lieu of beef and
mutton; for we are told “there is an
opening for the son of a butcher, on
terms of mutual accommodation.” In some places it is proposed to
give grammar in exchange for grocery; and the piano is advertised to
be imparted as an equivalent for coals, or the harp is to be taken out in
cheese and butter.
Some advertisers, in a fit of enthusiastic devotion to the best interests
of humanity, propose to enter into a sort of barter; and one gentleman
obligingly offers to receive a little girl into his family if any one will take
his two great thumping boys to board and educate by way of equivalent.

GENERAL MEDICAL ILLUMINATION.
The blue bottles of medicine have been shining with unwonted radiance
lately, throughout both the country and London; the general practitioners
having :3. illuminated, to testify their joy at the abandonment of
SIR JAMrs GRAHAM's Physic and Surgery Bill.
Numerous inscriptions and emblematic devices, in variegated lamps
and transparencies, expressive of the sense—or nonsense—of the pro-
fession respecting that happy event, have come under our own cognisance.
From certain peculiarities in their general style and character, we
apprehend that, for their design and execution, the medical men who
displayed them were greatly indebted to their pupils,
We noticed various legends and mottos, surrounded with garlands and
stars of great brilliancy; as also several transparencies, such as Britannia
shielding Medicine from the Home Secretary; Quackery, with a box
of life pills, prostrate beneath Medicine's feet; and Medicine and Surgery
(with their names beneath them, to prevent mistakes) dancing: a sort of
Polka, hand-in-hand. But that which most struck us was the transparency
of a Pure Surgeon, so beautifully managed, that whilst it was quite
plain for whom it was meant, the words, “Smuggled Charter,” and
“Self-constituted Fellow,” were clearly visible behind it, as were the
letters “38 s. d,” the real motto of the College of Surgeons. In short,
the figure was as perfectly transparent, as if it had been one of those
living, humbugs who pretend to practise pure surgery, but who are now
seen through by everybody.
“SWEETS TO THE SWEET.”
It is with no eyery day feeling of delight that we copy the following
from the Court Circular –
“Baron De Langen, attaché of the Prussian Legation, had the honour of deliver-
ing to His Royal Highness Painch Albert two of the new fine helmets of the
Prussian infantry and cavalry guards, as a present from His Royal Highness the
PRINCE or PRussia.”
Happy the genius when enshrined in royalty This present of the
“new fine helmets” is, of course, only a touching acknowledgment of the
vastness of thought, the grandeur of intellect, and unspeakable delicacy of
taste, shown in the Albert hat. We believe that, following out the true
bent of his genius, the Prince intends to establish a museum for head-gear
of every description, from the ancient head-piece to the present Nassau tile.
The Duke of WellingtoN has, in the handsomest manner, already sub-
scribed two of his peculiar beavers; and when Ireland is no longer under
the dominion of the brutal Saxon, O'Connell has promised to forward to
the collection his cap of repeal. We believe that, in a short time, the
Prince's museum will be opened to the inspection of the nobility.
THE SOLICITOR-GENERAL.
Pooh SIR Robert PEEL I His late embarrassment has touched our
sympathies. He has been compelled to make MR. APPLEPIP KELLY Soli-
citor-General. With many shudderings must he have done that noisome
handiwork. MR. KELLY has thereupon opened his manifesto of principles
—the poverty of language does sometimes compelus to use strange words
—to his late Cambridge constituents. He says—among other things—
“Civil and religious liberty have been protected. We are at peace with every nation
in the world. Our wealth, [the wealth of how many?] resources, and power are rapidly
increasing. Taxation upon the necessaries of life, and the commodities in most general
use, has been largely reduced, or altogether taken off. AGRicultures, trade, and com-
merce prosper. [Agriculture prospers!] Capital, in its immense accumulation, has
found new channels of investment, giving unlimited employment to labour, and reward
to industry. Even in IRELAND agitation has ceased, and tranquillity [with murders at
the church-doors] and contentment begin to prevail.”
Will any arithmetician count us up the number of flaws, direct and
implied, in the above paragraph
THE GOMERSAL MUSEUM.
ositively there is no truth whatever
) in the report that the Gomersal
Museum is to share the fate of
the Napoleon Museum, by being
submitted to public auction. The
Gomersal Museum will be offered
to the nation on moderate terms,
at the close of the Astleian career
of the great creature who has
collected it.
The following are some of the
principal articles comprised in
it:—
The snuff-box in which he
pinches JEAN Coster's fingers,
when the latter accompanies his
taking a pinch from the Em-
peror's box, by a critical remark on the Emperor's policy.
The epaulette torn by the Emperor off the lieutenant who had disgraced
himself before the walls of Moscow, by flirting with the affianced bride of
one of the Russian peasantry.
The enormous property telescope through which the Emperor looks at
the six French cuirassiers directly they have finished a movement round
the stage, and while they are still going off at the wing within six feet of him.
The boots, with the horse-guard tops, worn by the Emperor for one
hundred successive nights in the Battle of Waterloo.
The cross of the Legion of Honour given to the sergeant in the Scotch
Greys for bullying the Emperor in his own tent, and uttering some clap-
traps complimentary to the British policy.
The cork with which the Emperor corked his eyebrows, and the hare's
foot with which he made up his face, throughout the whole Russian cam-
paign, and subsequently at Waterloo.
It will be seen from the nature of the above items, that the Gomersal
Museum is by far too valuable and interesting a collection to be lightly
scattered away to the highest bidders. We strongly recommend the
trustees of the British Museum to look to it. We are sure that it might
take its place worthily by the side of some of the spifflicated black beetles
and other articles to be found in that great national receptacle of good,
bad, and indifferent rarities.
. A DUKE WANTED,
WHEREAs sundry reports affecting the character of a noble Duke
have of late been most industriously circulated, and the said noble Duke—who is
believed to have vast estates somewhere in Sutherlandshire—having taken no measures
whatever to rebut the calumnies, the friends of his Grace have naturally become most
anxious as to his whereabout, believing him to have been clandestinely spirited away
into some remote cranny of the earth where the Times does not circulate. It is hereby
declared that all such parties withholding from the aforesaid Duke a knowledge of the
matters brought against him, will be punished according to the highest penalty of
public opinion. Should this happily meet the eye of the Duke himself, he is implored,
if possible, to return to the good graces of his friends, by instantly disproving the
charges so wickedly set forth against him.—N.B. The eyes of England and of Scotland
are upon him.
Character no object.
WE suppose SIR Robert PEEL in his own household, whenever he is
hiring a new servant, always studiously inquires whether he has a “good
character from his last place.” We only wish, when he is engaging a
servant for any public situation, he would exercise the same discretion.
If a question to the above effect had only been put to a certain Solicitor-
General, who has lately been taken into the service of John Bull, we are
sure the gentleman would have been told to suit himself with a place
elsewhere.

MRS. CAUDLE'S CURTAIN LECTURES.
LECTURE XXV.
MRs. CAUDLE, weariED of MARGATE, HAS “A GREAT DESIRE TO
SEE FRANCE.”
LEss me, arm’t you tired,
CAUDLE 1 No? Well, was
there ever such a man
But nothing ever tires
you. Of course, it's all
you can read your news-
papers and—What ? So
can I? And I wonder
what would become of the
children if I did No ;
it's enough for their father
to lose his precious time,
talking about politics, and
bishops, and lords, and
a pack of people who
wouldn't care a pin if we
hadn't a roof to cover us
—it’s well enough for—
no, CAUDLE, no : I'm not
going to worry you ; I
never worried you yet,
and it isn't likely I should
begin now. But that's
always the way with you
—always. I’m sure we
should be the happiest
couple alive, only you do
so like to have all the talk
to yourself. We’re out
º, upon pleasure, and there-
º fore let's be comfortable.
- Still, I must say it; when
you like, you’re an aggravating man, CAUDLE, and you know it.
“What hare you done now? There, now ; we won't talk of it. No ;
let’s go to sleep: otherwise, we shall quarrel—I know we shall.
What have you done, indeed That I can't leave my home for a
few days, but I must be insulted . Everybody upon the pier saw it.
Saw what? How can you lie there in the bed and ask me Saw
what, indeed . Of course, it was a planned thing—regularly settled
before you left London. Oh yes! I like your innocence, MR.
CAUDLE ; not knowing what I’m talking about. It's a heart-
breaking thing for a woman to say of her own husband; but you've
been a wicked man to me. Yes; and all your tossing and tumbling
about in the bed won't make it any better.
“Oh, it’s easy enough to call a woman ‘a dear soul.” I must be
very dear, indeed, to you, when you bring down Miss PartTYMAN
to—there now ; you needn’t shout like a wild savage Do you
know that you’re not in your own house—do you know that we’re
in lodgings? What do you suppose the people will think of us?
You needn't call out in that manner, for they can hear every word
that’s said. What do you say? Why don't I hold my tongue then
To be sure; anything for an excuse with you. Anything to stop
my mouth. Miss PRETTYMAN’s to follow you here, and I'm to
say nothing. I know she has followed you; and if you were to go
before a magistrate, and take a shilling oath to the contrary, I
wouldn't believe you. No, CAUDLE ; I wouldn't.
* Very well, then? Ha! what a heart you must have, to say ‘very
well; and after the wife I’ve been to you. I'm to be brought from
my own home—dragged down here to the sea-side—to be laughed at
before the world—don't tell me! Do you think I didn't see how she
looked at you—how she puckered up her farthing mouth—and—
what? Why did I kiss her, then? What’s that to do with it !
Appearances are one thing, Mn. CAUDLE ; and feelings are another.
As if women can't kiss one another without meaning anything by it !
And you—I could see you—looked as cold and as formal at her as-
well, CAUDLE 1 I wouldn’t be the hypocrite you are for the world !
“There, now ; I’ve heard all that story. I dare say she did come
down to join her brother. How very lucky, though, that you should
be here ! Ha! haſ how very lucky that—ugh ugh ugh 1 and
with the cough I’ve got upon me—oh, you've a heart like a sea-side
flint 1 Yes, that's right. That’s just like your humanity. I can't
very well for you : yes,
catch a cold, but it must be my own fault—it must be mythin shoes.
I dare say you'd like to see me in ploughman's boots; ’t would be no
matter to you how I disfigured myself. Miss PRETTY MAN's foot,
now, would be another thing—no doubt.
“I thought when you would make me leave home—I thought we
were coming here on pleasure; but it’s always the way you embitter
my life. The sooner that I’m out of the world, the better. What
do you say? Nothing 2 But I know what you mean, better than if
you talked an hour. I only hope you'll get a better wife, that's all,
Mk. CAUDLE. What? You’d not try Wouldn't you? I know you.
In six months you’d fill up my place; yes, and dreadfully my dear
children would suffer for it. -
“CAUDLE, if you roar in that way, the people will give us warning
to-morrow. Can't I be quiet then 3 Yes—that’s like your artfulness:
anything to make me hold my tongue. But we won't quarrel. I’m
sure if it depended upon me, we might be as happy as doves. I
mean it—and you needn't groan when I say it. Good night, CAUDLE.
What do you say? Bless me! Well, you are a dear soul, CAUDLE ;
and if it wasn't for that Miss PRETTYMAN–no, I’m not torturing
you. I know very well what I’m doing, and I wouldn't torture you
for the world; but you don't know what the feelings of a wife are,
CAUDLE ; you don't. -
“CAUDLE—I say, CAUDLE. Just a word, dear. Well? Now, why
should you snap me up in that way. You want to go to sleep? So do
I; but that’s no reason you should speak to me in that manner.
You know, dear, you once promised to take me to France. You
don't recollect it? Yes—that’s like you : you don't recollect many
things you’ve promised me; but I do. There's a boat goes on
Wednesday for Boulogne, and comes back the day afterwards,
What of it 2 Why, for that time we could leave the children with
the girls, and go nicely. Nonsense 3. Of course; if I want anything
it's always nonsense. Other men can take their wives half
over the world; but you think it quite enough to bring me down
here to this hole of a place, where I know every pebble on the
beach like an old acquaintance—where there’s nothing to be seen
but the same machines—the same jetty—the same donkeys—the
same everything. But then, I’d forgot; Margate has an attraction
for you—Miss PRETTYMAN 's here. No ; I’m not censorious, and
I wouldn't backbite an angel; but the way in which that young
woman walks the sands at all hours—there ! there l—I've done: I
can't open my lips about that creature, but you always storm.
“You know that I always wanted to go to France; and you bring
me down here only on purpose that I should see the French cliffs—
just to tantalise me, and for nothing else. If I’d remained at home
—and it was against my will I ever came here—I should never have
thought of France; but, -to have it staring in one's face all day,
and not to be allowed to go; it's worse than cruel, MR. CAUDLE—
it's brutal. Other people can take their wives to Paris; but you
always keep me moped up at home. And what for Why, that I
may know nothing—yes; just on purpose to make me look little, and
for nothing else.
“Hearen bless the woman 2 Ha! you’ve good reason to say that,
Mn. CAUDLE ; for I’m sure she's little blessed by you. She's been
kept a prisoner all her life—has never gone anywhere—oh yes!
that’s your old excuse,_talking of the children. I want to go to
France, and I should like to know what the children have to do with
it? They're not babies now—are they But you’ve always thrown
the children in my face. If Miss PRETTYMAN–there now; do you
hear what you've done—shouting in that manner The other lodgers
are knocking overhead : who do you think will have the face to look
at 'em to-morrow morning I shan't—breaking people's rest in that
way !
“Well, CAUDLE-I declare it's getting daylight, and what an
obstinate man you are l—tell me, shall I go to France f*
“I forget,” says CAUDLE, “my precise answer; but I think I gave
her a very wide permission to go somewhere—whereupon, though
not without remonstrance as to the place—she went to sleep.”
" A Frenchman's Fate.
DURING this month there have been more prosecutions against the
press in France, more convictions, and, of course, more imprisonments
and fines. The invention of this new way of celebrating the “Fétes of
July" belongs exclusively to Louis-PHILIPPE, and as the merit of the
thing is decidedly his, we hope no other country will show a mean
jealousy by imitating it. Let us leave the French to their own way of
enjoying themselves |

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE FRENCH IN ALGIERS.—LOVELY WAR 1
THE Christian French—employed in the civilisation of the Moors
—have made a bonfire of eight hundred men, women, and children :
Eight hundred human creatures have been given to the flames-an
offering to the stern necessity of war, of lovely war! Colon El PEL1s-
sIER was the demon in command on the occasion. Beautiful are his
laurels gathered in the caverns of the Dahara, manured by the roasted
flesh and charred bones of a multitude of shepherds !
The Akhbar speaks of the atrocity, as though it narrated the
roasting of oxen for a public feast. When the Ouled Riahs first took
refuge in the cavern, the gallant Colonel offered them terms. They
were refused.
“This state of things continued till the night of the 19th, when, losing all patience,
and no longer having a hope of otherwise subduing these fanatics, who formed a perpe-
tual nucleus of revolt in the country, the fire was renewed and rendered intense. During
this time the cries of the unhappy wretches, who were being suffocated, were dreadful,
and then nothing was heard but the crackling of the faggots. This silence spoke volumes.
The troops entered and found 500 dead bodies. About 150, who still breathed, were
brought into the fresh air, but a portion of them died afterwards.”
Later accounts show that, in all, Colon El PELIssrER has sent
eight hundred souls to bear witness against him at the day of judg-
ment 1
We know that the wisest, the most humane government, may at
times be compromised by the stupidity, the brutality of its instru-
ments; but if it fail to punish the offender, then it is a sharer of
the infamy.
Louis-PHILIPPE prides himself upon being a very respectable king;
a monarch with a proper notion of all the domestic virtues. It is said
he is a humane man; not at all the military bloodhound that Young
France, in its love of gore and glory, sighs for. We therefore wait,
with much interest, to see what his royal benevolence will do with
the man-roasting Colonel. Will he rebuke and call home the mur-
derous incendiary, or will he suffer him to add to the heap of human
ashes that already make an accursing monument to his memory !
It is in this way that the French are to civilise the Arabs—in this
way that the benighted infidels are to be taught the lovely meekness
of the Christian faith ! One omission may be placed to the account
of the Colonel. When the roasting was over, wherefore did he not
order the celebration of Te Deum to complete the blasphemy I
There is, of course, a party in France who will sing songs of
triumph to the Colonel, seeing that he is only working out the
mission of a conqueror. Indeed, we should not be surprised if—on
his return to France—he were presented with some tangible testi-
monial of the admiration of the children of glory. We beg, with all
deference, to propose a faggot in bronze.
A KNIFE AND FORK JURY.
<a Ew things have pleased us more than the
--~~~i announcement that “so unexpected was the
**- S verdict of acquittal of Lord Wiscount Dillon
at the Surrey Sessions,” in the turnpike case,
that after the discharge of the jury, the
“twelve gentlemen, at the invitation of his
Lordship's solicitor, proceeded to a neighbour-
ing tavern, where they were most liberally
treated.” We are delighted to hear it. The
fact proves that there is gratitude in law; that
attornies have bowels. We think that the
example so wisely set by LoRD Dillon's soli-
citor might be followed, to the exceeding
comfort of all men summoned on juries. We
would propose that, in all civil actions, the
two parties should each send in to the jury-box
a bill of fare, to be served up for dinner by the winning party. Thus,
instead of the jury being compelled to listen to witnesses, and to the
shocking sophistications of counsel on both sides, they would only have
to judge of the relative excellence of the feast promised by either party,
and to return their verdict accordingly. Whereupon they might retire
to a neighbouring tavern, and—like LoRD DILLon's jury—drink the
glorious institution of “Trial by Roast and Boiled.”
Another YOUNG ONE.
A New journal has been started at New York, called “Young
America.” We believe the principles it advocates are—universal repu-
diation, mint-juleps, no taxes, and a tarnation thrashing to all the world.

Upon the bench the silent Member sat,
His hand and motion resting on his hat;
When, on a sudden, SIBTHoRPE rose to speak.
A pallor came across the Member's cheek,
Because he knew no effort he could make
Would now enable him to keep awake.
"Twas as he fear’d—while onward SIBTHoRPE goes,
The Member falls into a gentle doze;
A dozen sentences—not loud, but deep-
Had mesmerised the Member fast asleep;
His state of coma was at length extreme,
And then that Member dreamed this little dream :-
He thought he'd left the legislative halls,
And feared no more the House of Commons' calls;
He fancied that he saw the SPEAKER's mace
Turn on a sudden to a horn of chase;
The “Oh’s” and “Cheers” with which the House abounds,
Seem'd like the yelping of a pack of hounds;
But when the PREMIER rose to make reply,
He thought the pack were coming in full cry;
And in a sudden general shout of “Oh,”
He join'd by instinct with “Yoicks, tally-ho "
But still he dream'd : he fancied that the House
Chang'd to the moors—the members to the grouse.
He gave a cry as loud as he was able,
“Let all their bills be laid upon my table !”
At which there rose a general cry of “Spoke l’” -
And the poor Member from his dream awoke.

PUNCH*S GUIDE TO SERVANTS.
THE COOK.
on ages it has been believed that a certain
wicked person sends cooks; but John-
son has well observed, and so by the
Sº bye have SMITH and BRown, that “if
we had no cooks, we should be as bad
as cannibals.”
Cooks have always been the subject
of sarcasm, and Jones tells us, that
even in his day the wits loved to give
the cooks a good roasting. It is said,
moreover, that “too many cooks will
spoil the broth,” from which we may
presume, that as the workhouse broth
is the very worst in the world, a great
many cooks must have a hand in it.
Apicius was the first man who made
cookery a science, and he poisoned him-
self; no doubt with his own cookery.
He invented several sauces, and was,
in fact, the Roman HAnvey. He is
believed to have been the first who
added the trimmings to legs of mutton, and he took for his motto the line
in WIRGIL :—
* At Regina gravijandudum saucia curá.”
because the luxury of gravy, jam, sauce, and curry are all shadowed
forth in the quotation alluded to.
DR. Johnson was, according to Boswell, “a man of very nice discri-
mination in the science of cookery,” and he was proverbial for his sauce,
which he dealt out to every one with the greatest freedom. Boswell
once asked him if he liked pickles, when he said, “No Sir, the man who
would eat a pickle, would pick a pocket.”
Boswell adds, “I ventured to say he would ;” and they wound up the
evening with grog, which Boswell, as usual, had to pay for ; and it is
thought that the expression of “Standing Sam" originated with Boswell
having to stand whatever SAM (Johnson) chose to call for.
The celebrated DR. PARR was also a great epicure, and liked his
victuals underdone, from which we have the expression Parr-boiling.
MILton loved his meat well-dressed, and died with a good thing in h
mouth ; but whether it was a morsel of philosophy, or something nice,
has never transpired. .
Having said thus much of the ancient and classical who took an interest
in cookery, we plunge down stairs into the modern kitchen, and embrace
the cook of the present period.
On going to be hired, you will, perhaps, be told there are no perquisites
allowed. Don't stick out about that, for if perquisites are not allowed,
you must take them.
It is easy to say the meat makes no dripping, and, of course, you can’t
account for it.
It is a rule in cookery to make the best and the most of everything, and
you will therefore sell your kitchen-stuff at the marine-store shop that
will give the best price for it.
In some families the mistress of the house will assist the cook; but
she should have a sickener of that as soon as possible. If she makes
a pie, spoil it in the baking; for if there is any truth in the adage about
“too many cooks,” the lady of the house should not be encouraged in
making one of the number.
Order is a great essential to a cook, who should keep everything in its
lace, taking care to keep herself as snugly in her place as possible.
Wever connive at dishonesty in others, but keep yourself to yourself;
for, if you rob your mistress, the least return you can make is not to
sanction others in doing so.
Never go into any place where a cat is not kept. This useful domestic
animal is the true servants' friend, accounting for the disappearance of
tit-bits, lumps of butter, and other odd matters, as well as being the
author of all mysterious breakages. What the safety-valve is to the
steam-engine, the cat is to the kitchen, preventing all explosions or
blowings-up that might otherwise occur in the best regulated families.
Having laid down some general principles for the guidance of cooks, we
give a few maxims that cannot be too strictly attended to.
1. Keep yourself clean and tidy if you can. If your fingers are greasy
wipe them on your hair, which thus acquires a polish.
2. When a joint comes down from dinner, cut off what you intend for
your supper. If cut while the joint is warm, it does not show that it has
been cut. Relieve it also from all superfluous fat, which will of course
go into your grease-pot.
3. If you want a jelly-bag, cut up an ironing-blanket for the purpose.
The former is of course wanted in a hurry, but the latter may be pro-
cured at leisure.
4. When your dishes come down stairs, throw them all into scalding
water at once. Those that are not broken by the operation may after.
wards be taken out, and put in their proper places.
- * Scour your pickle-jars, but empty them first, if you are fond of
pickie.
6. If you have been peeling onions, cut bread-and-butter with the
same knife; it will show the multifariousness of your occupations, and
perhaps give a hint for raising your wages.
7. Let your spit and your skewers be always rusty; or, at least, do
not take the trouble to polish them; for by leaving great black holes in
the meat, they show it has been roasted, which is always better than
being baked, and it will be the more relished in consequence.
8. Never do anything by halves, except lamb, which you must some-
times do by quarters.
9. If you are cooking even a sheep's head or a bullock's heart, take
pains with them, so that what you do may be equally creditable to your
head and heart.
10. If you have a follower, or a policeman, who likes a snack, cut it
off each joint before you cook it—for everything loses in the cooking—
and the disappearance of one pound, at least, in eight or nine, may thus
be easily accounted for.
The above maxims will be sufficient to guide the cook in her course of
service, and we do not add any receipts, for it has been well said by Dr.
Kitchener, or might have been said by him as well as by any one else—
that he who gives a receipt for making a stew, may himself make a sad
hash of it.
In bidding farewell to the cook, we would have her remember that her
control over the safe will give her a peculiar influence over the hearts
of the police, and she must be careful not to enervate a whole division,
and leave a district defenceless, by being too lavish with the blandish-
ments of love and the larder.
T H E MO DE R N BIY MIEN.”
The alternation from love to glory and from glory to love, which we
alluded to the other day as being the characteristic of the soldier on the
stage, is singularly exemplified in the career of the illustrious WELLINeron,
who has left the camp of Mars for the court of Hymen. The Duke is to
be seen nearly every morning at St. George's or some other fashionable
church, “giving away” some fair and aristocratic bride, till he has posi-
tively become the recognised medium for the transfer of lovely innocence
from the parent's care to the husband's solicitude... Even the parish-
clerk, or the ºjº. usual alternatives with those who have not
come prepared with fathers or mothers—cannot boast of having given
away so many girls as the Duke of WELLINGTON.
One would think that his Grace kept a kind of Matrimonial Bazaar, or
Connubial Agency-Office—so strong a personal interest does he appear to
take in finding wives and husbands for his male and female acquaintances.
The song says, that “Love was once a little boy:” but it is evident that
Hymen is a very elderly gentleman. Perhaps the Duke still clings to the
love of conquest; and he likes to i. conquests being made as
much as possible. His Grace should be made Colonel of a new regiment
of female sharp-shooters, in which piercing eyes should be the substitutes
for swords and bayonets.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH AND THE LITERARY SWELL MOB.
WE here present the portrait of a very ill-used gentleman—of one
who every hour has his pockets picked; though each pocket, like
the magical purse, is inexhaustible. Nevertheless, in the eye of the
law—which eye, by the way, has, in certain literary cases, a frequent
habit of winking, or worse, of going fast asleep—in the eye of the
law it is as much a felony to rob a banker as a beggar.
Therefore, we have taken counsel with our indignation, and are
henceforth resolved not to be pillaged and to hold our tongue at the
same time. We herewith present portraits of certain of the
literary swell-mob who at this moment eat white-bait from their
robbery of Punch. The beholder will at once acknowledge the
felonious expression of all the offenders. One fellow has seized our
pocket-book—Punch's Pocket-Book t—and is walking off, delirious
with the thought of the contents. Another full-fed-looking varlet
has got a sheet of paper, which he intends to print upon and adver-
tise as “The same size as Punch.” Now, the notes of the Bank of
Elegance are of “the same size” as the notes of the Bank of
England; the dimensions are the same, but where is the water-
mark—where are the figures You may make a piece of glass of
“ the same size” as the Narcot diamond; but what will the jewellers
give for it ! In the background may be seen a shadowy something,
franticly brandishing a pair of scissors. This something is called
by the grace of small critics a dramatist; and he, it will be seen, is
making down upon our pockets, either to sever away a subject
his flimsy pieces; just as South American belles sometimes imprison
fire-flies in their muslin flounces.
It will be seen what a shabby, sneaking, sinister, felonious set
the offenders are : creatures with no more red blood in them than
grasshoppers. And yet—foul and contemptible as their trade is—
bitter as their bread must be, half made up as it is of dirt—they have
accessories in their meanness, helpers, and, as the law has it, com-
forters in their wickedness. We mean the buyers—the erring few—
who lay out their money upon the evil-doers. To these few we
say,+Beware of counterfeitsl Cease to buy stolen goods—though the
money spent upon the abomination shall be no more than so many
º; and you bring at once to bankruptcy the “pickers and
stealers.”
THE WATCH-TOWERS ON HUNGERFORD BRIDGE.
THE wonder of everybody is, what the watch-towers on the Hunger-
ford Bridge are intended for. Some say they are to be let out to single
gentlemen as lodgings ; and we certainly think the address, “Watch-
tower, 100th link, Hungerford Suspension Bridge, Thames,” would read
very distingué on a gentleman's card.
Others declare that the towers have been leased for ninety-nine years
to an enterprising washerwoman, who intends washing her linen, after
the Parisian fashion, at the foot of the bridge, and hanging the clothes
out to dry along the chains. The effect of this on a summer's evening,
when the sun is setting, would be very beautiful. A hundred shirts
fluttering in the breeze, festooned with socks, and illuminated by parti-
coloured handkerchiefs, would present a picture gorgeous enough to
remind one of the East.
" There is a rumour, also, that an offer has been made by a zoological
manager to rent the two towers for the purposes of tight-chain exhibi-
tions—a gentleman dancing on one chain, and a lady on the other ; but
we think the report that they have been let to the Admiralty, for the sake
of having sentinels continually posted in the attics, is the most vraisem-
blable of any we have heard. The intention of the Board is to guard
against the possibility of Joinville ever coming up the Thames with the
| French fleet unperceived to sack SIR Robert PEEL's residence. When we
think of the vigilant look-out our brave Admiralty always keeps for the
| interests of England, this appointment cannot be too strongly applauded:
as the strongest reinforcement they have lately made to the strength of
the British Navy.

Mutual Wrong.
MR. JAMEs, the novel-spinner, has, by advertisement, offered the sum
of ten pounds' reward to whosoever will “prove whence the report first
emanated,” that he-MR. JAMEs—had “undertaken to edit the periodical
work, called Ainsworth's Magazine.” We understand that the proprietors
of the said Magazine have offered a like sum for the detection of the
offender. Both parties feel themselves equally injured.
OBSOLETE LAW.
By Rule 86, Ordnance Department, it is ordained—“No person
belonging to the Department is to receive any fee, consideration.9r com-
pensation from any one whatever, upon pain of dismissal.”. We hope
this rule has been cancelled, for as CAPTAIN BoldeRo and MR. Bonham
still belong to the establishment, it really looks as if it were kept there
purposely to annoy them. . It is true the gentlemen made the rule
themselves; but they could have had no idea, at the time of making it,
they were building a wall to knock their own heads against.

HROUGHAM AND THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.
Pooh BROUGHAM has been making a sad to-do about the delay in get-
ting into his new House; for, like a 'child who once knows that he is
going to move, he cannot rest contented until the “moving" is effected.
He cannot feel himself at home in the present temporary structure; and
he has been heard plaintively warbling the following ditty during one of
the speeches of CAMPBELL, when nothing but the dull murmur of “plain
Jack,” as he calls himself, and the lugubrious tones of BRough AM himself
have been heard to disturb the sleep that the rest of their Lordships may
have been indulging in :—
There’s nae luck about the House,
There's nae luck at all;
There is no pleasure in this House,
It is so very small.
SOLDIER IN C.
BEING a universal chronicler, the late glorious victory of the 18th
of June cannot, of course, have escaped the notice of Mr. Punch.
He doesn't mean the Battle of Waterloo-Heaven forbid!—about
which there has been as much bragging and vapouring in England
eyer since, as to turn any good Christian sick; but the French
victory of the Cautera or Dahara just achieved by a French Colonel,
who has made his name very famous in history.
Having published a proclamation, setting forth that the French
nation was the great centre of peace, religion, and civilisation, (all
nations are in the habit of lying and swaggering about themselves in
this way,) MARSHAL BUGEAuD, the Duke of Isly, invited certain
Arabs, to whose lands and property he had taken a fancy, to come in
and yield them up. The Arabs refusing, the famous Colon El
PELIssieh was sent to their village to persuade them with fire and
sword.
These poor Arab rogues, with their wives, families, camels, and
horses, fled for refuge to a great cave in their district, which had often
served them for a sanctuary in the time of the Turkish dominion.
Here they used to remain while the tyrants were sacking their
villages, and robbing their fields; and when their masters had
retired with what they could get, the Dahara Arabs came back to
their houses again, and so lived on until the next Razzia.
But the Turks were not so civilised as the French, as those poor
rascals quickly found. Having retreated into their hole of refuge,
the brave Colon El PELIssien put firewood at either end of it, and
then told them to come out and submit to his terms.
These must have been hard indeed : for the Arabs—with death
before them, and a knowledge of the infernal butcheries, rapine, and
cruelty of the French in Algeria for the last fifteen years; a full
knowledge, we say, that in the way of murder the leader of a French
razzia-column would stick at nothing—preferred rather to die than
to come to terms.
Then fire was lighted at the two ends of the cavern for two days,
and eight hundred of God's men, women and children were by
Colonel PELIssien stifled and murdered there. The whole of the
tribe is exterminated; and the French flag, that rainbow of liberty,
as BERANGER calls it, doubtless flaunts over the now quiet scene.
The French have been so accustomed to razzias of late, that they
have found a glory in these successful forays, and bragged and boasted
of the dexterity of murder and rapine which their troops have dis-
played in conducting them. It may have appeared a matter of
triumph rather than otherwise to Colon EL PEliss IER, who in the
course of his duty has sacked and fired hundreds of villages ere this
—murdered thousands of Arabs defending their property—and been
rewarded and promoted for so doing; it may have seemed a famous
opportunity to Colon EL PELIssien to stifle a whole tribe of savages
at once, and he may be looking out for his general's epaulettes for
this victory: but the wholesale completeness of this murder has been
somehow too strong for the French gorge; and MARshAL SoulT
is actually made to say that he “deplores and disapproves of it.”
The French opposition journals, too, cry out in the strongest terms
of reprobation. “What will England, what will Germany say?” says
one; “the character of generous honour which constitutes our strength
with other nations, must disappear.” “What an act is this,” cries
another, “unworthy of the noble and holy France of the 19th century,
who combats heroically in the field, but does not massacre her ene-
mies. How henceforth will our Government appear in the eyes of
Europe 1"
“The eyes of Europe;” that is what they are looking to. Gracious
Heaven 1 where does a nation's vanity end ? Here, in presence of a
crime before which men should hide their heads for shame, in the
bitterest abasement and self-humiliation, these men ask “what will
Europe say?” brag about their “generous honour,” and exalt “the noble
and holy France of the 19th century!” There's something frightful in this
blindness of conceit. What a moment to boast of generous honour,
and to lay claim to nobleness and holiness 1 when a man should only
be thinking of pity, and sorrow, and shame !
The same paper which contains the story of PELissren, narrates a
great English military achievement, which might humble our pride a
little, could it ever be supposed that the English nation possesses
any. Two soldiers of the Foot Guards were flogged at Windsor for
an act of gross insubordination. They refused to go to the black-hole
when ordered; and they had been ordered thither for refusing to
strip themselves before the visiting surgeon, and undergo a public
examination with sirty other naked men.
So, for pleading the common privilege of modesty, the savage
military law, which would have exposed them like brutes, tied them
up and lashed them like brutes; and having glutted itself on their
mangled and bleeding shoulders, sent them to hospital to be cured,
and to be ready for future service.
Beyond a letter of complaint in the newspapers, this action caused
no particular remark. The troops were marched to church next
day to hear the Gospel preached to them, and went through their
devotions with the same precision as they would go through their
parade.
And we too take all occasions to boast of our civilisation; and in
matters of religion we consider that we are a favoured people, and
we admire and honour the glorious military profession, in which a
man's duty is to commit murder, as at Cautera, or to submit to
shame, as in Windsor barracks last week.
g-
Patriotic Feeling.
THE flag which has braved (for three years) the breeze, without the
battle, at Buckingham Palace, was torn to ribbons last week. The
accounts in the newspapers say it was the wind that was the cause of this.
We can assure our readers it was the fine spirit of nationality that proved
its destruction; for the noble flag was so annoyed at seeing #. MAJESTY
go five times in one week to the Opera and the French plays—and not
once to a national theatre—that in its rage it actually lashed itself
to pieces.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“ART-UNION ?” EPISTLES.
ssuk EDLY we know not why Punch should
have been honoured with a copy of the
subjoined correspondence; but finding
it in our letter-box, we print it.
“To the Editor of the “Art-Union.”
“SIR,-Your Art-Union for June has
just fallen into my hands; my little boy,
in the innocence of childhood, having
brought me a few leaves of it to patch
his broken kite. There, sir, I read what
you say of your subscribers; that they
never buy any picture without first
hearing what you say of it. For myself,
I never heard of the Art Union before ;
but hope I am properly thankful for the
blessing you must be to picture-buyers
in saving 'em the trouble of thinking for
themselves.
“I now, sir, come to my point. I have
been much tempted to lay out a shilling on a painted picture by a person
named LEECH, in fact, to buy the portraits of MR. and MRs. CAUDLE.
The money was almost out of my fingers when my wife—you'd love
that woman for her sweet sense and tenderness, if you knew her—when
my wife proposed that I should write to the Editor of the Art-Union to
know if the thing was worth the money. “Write,’ says she to the Head
—Hand—and Heart:’ and then she added, “for if his heart is only
as soft as his head, what a dear gentleman he must be l’ For once, I’ve
taken my wife's advice, and enclose a penny post-stamp for your
answer.
“I remain your accidental reader,
“John SMUDGE.”
*P.S., MRs. SMUDGE also wants to know if you give your advice upon
tea-boards : She has seen a pretty thing, with a Woodman Smoking his
Pipe in the Snow, and his dog running after him, and would wish to know
what she should give for it.”
* The Art-Union to John SMUDGE.
* Exceeding DEAR SIR,-You do our feelings extreme honour by the
complimentary candour of your charming note. Such epistles fall—we
assure you, very dear Sir—like refreshing dew upon us, parched up as
we are by a scorching sense of our responsibilities. We know that upon
our opinion depend the legs and shoulders of mutton of thousands of rising
artists; and therefore cannot but feel—in sooth, dear Sir, we cannot—
in the hand, head, and heart, you have done us the honour to allude to,
the most distressing sense of the value of our good word. We would
not hurt M.R. Leech—oh, dear Sir, very far from it—nevertheless,
agonising as it is to us, we have a duty to execute.
“We think the face of CAUDLE happy; nevertheless, as admirers of
temperance, we object to the redness of his nose. The texture of the
counterpane, too, is a little woolly. There is a nice freedom of handling
in the border of Mas. CAUDLE's nightcap, and the bold way in which
her curl-papers are brought up shows that the artist is not deficient in a
knowledge of the human heart. Were we inclined to be hypercritical,
which we never are, we should say that the watch-pocket at the head of
the bed was grossly unnatural, being considerably beyond the reach of
CAUDLs. The curtains, too, are evidently out of drawing. “Tape-tied
curtains, never meant to draw.” He he l
“We cannot give this opinion—for we would not very much hurt MR.
Leech—without dilaceration of the heart-strings. We have, however,
acquitted ourselves of our duty. And now that our task is ended, we are
weary-in sooth, very weary—hat, gloves, and waistcoat
“The picture you speak of may be worth a shilling ; nevertheless, very
dear sir, there is a most tasteful and impartial periodical devoted to art,
that is published monthly at the same price.
- “Yours, affectionately, very dear sir,
“The ‘ART-UNION."
*P.S.–If dear MRs. SMUDGE will forward us the tea-board—for we do
not know it—we will take time to consider our answer.”
.A. Wild-Goose Chase.
The following advertisement appeared in the Times last week:—
* WANTED–Cooks for the Stepney Union.”
The idea of any Union advertising for a Cook at all is funny enough ;
but when it comes to Cooks—an unlimited number of Cooks—just as if an
Union had a kitchen like the Reform Club, the advertisement must cer-
tainly belong to that order of things known as sending a person for
“strap-oil,” or “pigeon's-milk 1" The whole thing is clearly a hoax.
Why, it is just as absurd as if a person was to advertise for a treasurer,
and to direct him to apply to the British and Foreign. Destitute 1
THE CON SERVATIVE LAOCOON.
THE visitors to the New Conservative Club House in Pall Mall have no
doubt admired the cast of the Laocoon, which occupies so conspicuous a
place in the Entrance Hall. They ºº: it is placed there
merely as a work of art; they are wrong. e fell into this mistake our-
selves, and were enlightened by a Conservative member, whom we found
the other day shedding tears before the group. He was a Tory of the
good old school, and we did not suspect him of so much sympathy with
the arts. We told him so in a complimen tone.
“Arts, sir. You don't suppose it's the statue that affects me? No;
it's an allegory.”
“How so?” we asked innocently.
“Don’t you see the resemblance to INGL1s in the principal figure and
there's PLUMPTRE on the right and SIBTHoRPE on the left.”
We were puzzled for once. On our return, we took down our VIRGIL
and turning to the Second Book of the AEneid, set to work to discover
our friend's meaning. We think we have discovered it.
The group typifies the Conservatives in the gripe of the Maynooth and
Irish College Bills. Look at the passage and our translation of it, and it
will be evident to all we are right in our interpretation:—
“Ecce autem gemini a Tenedo, tranquilla per alta,
(Horresco referens) immensis orbibus angues
Incumbunt pelago, paritergue ad littora tendunt: &c. &c.
Now for our free translation.
When lo l two bills from Erin's fatal shore
Together trail their folds across the floor.
With huge preambles reared in front they wind,
Clause after clause in long-drawn length behind 1
While opposition benches cheer the while,
And PEEL grins horribly a ghastly smile.
The Tory phalanx shrinks dismayed and pale,
As fierce their helpless victims they assail.
First in their grasp pale PLUMPTRE they enfold,
Next SibTHORPE swears and struggles in their hold.
Then INGLIs, to their succour hastening fast,
With fierce amendments arm’d, is seized the last ;
He prays, he preaches, threatens, storms and bawls,
On Church and State and Constitution calls,
In vain, the bills ride rampant o'er their prey,
Tho' two divisions hold their onward way;
And, to the frequent call “Divide, divide,”
Nestle secure at Lord JoHN RUSSELL's side.
A SINGULAR CASE.
A QUEER fellow, who said his name was BRoom, was charged with
having given a false written character to an individual of the name of
KELLY, in order that the latter might get into a situation at Cambridge.
The aged delinquent, on being asked what he had to say for himself,
became very insolent, and declared he had a right to do or to say anything
he thought proper about anything and everything.
It having been ascertained that no one attached any importance to
what was said or done by the defendant, the old gentleman was admonished
and discharged.

- PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 51
THE LANDLORD'S BAZAAR.
HE Theatre Royal Covent Garden has been in a
very bad state ever since its late royal attack.
The stage is sunk very low, the treasury is in
the deepest decline, and the boxes look, “like
Niobe, all tiers.” Never has the place looked so
miserable since Mr. WALLAck's management, when
the theatre went through four seasons in less than
three weeks. Something, it is clear, must be done
to remove the infection from the building. Camphor,
brown-paper, whitewashing, and burnt feathers,
have tried their magic powers of fumigation, all in
vain. We propose, therefore, as an antidote is
principally wanted to the bane of the late Anti-
Corn-Law Exhibition, that an Agricultural Show
should be got up in the theatre, under the patro-
nage of the DUKE of Richmond, and the most
patriotic landowners in the kingdom, and that
they should send some of their prize-labourers to
the Show, as specimens of how the breed can be
improved by fine feeding. Scotland also should
be allowed to contribute; for if she has anything
like a labourer left, that sight alone, as a rarity,
would make the fortune of the exhibition. Groups of happy tenantry also
might be arranged about the exhibition; and if they are labelled, “All these
upon 7s. a week,” we are sure they will surprise many people who had no
notion before of the pretty state the English labourer can be brought to.
Models, too, of their happy homes might be exhibited; care being taken
to have a number of pigs, cows, and fowls running about them, as natu-
rally as if they were in the country. Nothing, in fact, should be wanting
to invest the scene with that air of reality which makes the condition of
the labourer a matter of such universal envy all over the world. If this
is effectively done, we are sure the aristocracy will rush to the theatre as
to a spot enriched with the dearest associations, and Her Majesty will
honour it again with her usual once a-year state-visit.
APPLEPIP KELLY.
PEEL's small difficulty, the new Solicitor-General, the pure of
Ipswich, is returned for Cambridge. There was every expectation
that he would be ticketed on for Windsor, but—great is PLutus,
great the virtues of Lond BRough AM's “head of our profession,”
and KELLY sits for Cambridge. On the conclusion of the election,
he addressed his constituents. He had, he said—
“Asked them to fight the battle of the constitution for him, for themselves, and for
the country. Nobly had they fought that battle; nobly had they won the victory.”
Turn we to the Times, and we discover with what sort of merce-
naries the spotless Solicitor-General fought the “battle of the con-
stitution.” An army of navigators had been recruited for the
glorious service:—
“Three gigantic ruffians, bearing the colours of Mr. Kelly, led the procession;
four followed, carrying a chair, which was supported on their shoulders by means of
- les, and in which was seated one of their companions, who was smoking, and had in
islap a huge beer-can. Every now and then he commanded his troop to halt, while
he took a copious swig, amidst the cheers of his fellows, who, by signs and expressions,
fndeavoured to make the spectators understand that there was some magic connexion
between the banners they bore and the beer they drank.”
There is no doubt that the connexion was the nearest and the
dearest that can tie some men; namely, the connexion of the breeches'
pocket. Not that MR. KELLY knew anything of the band of beer-
swigging Swiss hired to earn him laurels; not he. We have always
remarked that at election time, the father of craft and wicked-
ness sends out his emissaries to buy the souls of men; to purchase
their jackdaws and canaries at five pounds a head; to give any
money for kittens; to thrust bank-notes into pockets, under door-
ways, anywhere ! to compass the election pennyworth; the candidates
all unconscious of the wickedness as fledgling doves. And therefore
are we certain that the patriotic soul of the Solicitor-General must
have revolted from the fellows smoking and swilling in the name of
purity of election, and afterwards “fighting the battles of the consti-
tution” with broken flag-poles. It is said that the election of MR.
Kelly will be petitioned against. This may, or may not be; but
if envy should seek to unseat the Solicitor-General—the future
Banon Applepip, as, according to Brough AM, “he is destined for
the highest places of the law”—sure we are that the learned gentle-
man will show himself as white as the ermine he will one day
wear; will prove that he is as innocent of the bribery (“dearest
chuck!”) at Cambridge, as he was guiltless in bye-gone times at
Ipswich.
It is said that the day after MR. KELLY received his appointment
he was met by PEEL (who was walking with a friend), and was half
cut by the minister. Turning to his companion, PEEL observed—
“I am afraid to think what I have done;
Look on 't again I dare not l”
PUNCH PUZZLED.
The Irish newspaper intelligence informs us that the Most Noble, but
not most grammatical, the MARQUIs of LoNDoNDERRY, was lately pleased to
address to a Mr. WATson, chairman of a recent meeting of the Lisburn
Orangemen, an epistle, which, with regard to its object, the repression
of party demonstration,--was highly praiseworthy, but in respect of its
composition, exceedingly droll. Thus commences this curious document:
“DEAR Six,
“Deeply interested as I am, and ever must be, in the prosperity, peace, happi-
ness, and good order of the province of Ulster, and more particularly of the county of
Down, and that excellent tenantry I preside over, I cannot refrain from addressing you
as a chairman ºf a string of resolutions of the Lisburn Orangemen, signed with your
name, and published in the Dublin Evening Mail of the 30th ult.”
Now, whether the above paragraph was written by the Most Noble
Marquis or for him, we pretend not to know. It certainly betokens a
strange confusion of ideas. “A chairman of a string of resolutions”
may be an Irish character, but is certainly not an English phrase. We
never met with such a person anywhere before, and now that we meet
with him on paper we cannot make him out. We are unable, indeed,
to imagine what he is like, except a chairman of a succession of toasts;
a designation which, were we to apply it even to our Royal friend of
CAMBRIDGE, would assuredly be set down as some of our nonsense.
The Most Noble letter-writer—supposing the saddle (or panniers) to
have been placed on the right back—proceeds in the yet more singular
manner following:—
“Before it is too late, do not persevere in an attempt to mislead men anew who are
living peaceable and quiet under the laws.”
Before it is too late For what purpose For that of misleading the
men who are living “peaceable and quiet”? Very good advice, as far as
it goes ; but the recommendation not to make any such attempt at all,
either before or after it was too late, would have been much better, and
rather more intelligible. As if even Irish Orangemen would, knowingly,
persevere in an endeavour after it was too late. It would be monstrous to
entertain such a supposition of Irish pigs.
By the production, whereon we have thus bestowed a few words of
criticism, we have no doubt that the MARQUIs of Londonder Ry, if he
wrote it, meant well; notwithstanding which we must take the liberty of
asking him what he meant by it ! e do not wish to misconstrue his
Lordship's motives; but we should very much like to know how to con-
strue his language.
#ntertjange of 33risoners.
By a recent arrangement between this country and the Governments of
the United States and France, we are able to exchange criminals, but, b
some flaw in the treaty, we have not been able to get our criminals b
again. A bill has just been brought in to rectify this error, and we would
suggest the addition of a schedule, giving a sort of rate of exchange, or
table of the comparative value of criminals, in the style of our old friend
BonnycasTLE. Thus we might say, in-
American Measure.
20 Pickpockets make 1 Swindler.
6 Swindlers . - . . 1 Fraudulent Bankrupt.
10 Fraudulent Bankrupts . . 1 Felon.
4 Felons - - . . 1 Burglar.
50 Burglars - . . 1 American Repudiator.
and so on through the whole of the criminal catalogue.
We might have also a criminal city article, with the Culprits' Exchange
Intelligence, giving the different values of the numerous securities, from
handcuffs, which might be quoted at 2 premium, down to bail, at a
discount, or police surveillance at par, with a shade or two in favour of
the French markets. We presume that for a good lumping American
thief England would be expected to give a lot of small change in the
shape of a quantity of petty larceners.
One country might draw bills on the other for fifty felons, payable at
sight, or circular notes might be given, entitling the holder to take up a
certain quantity of criminals at various points of the continent. The
idea is altogether a very rich one, but if it is to be carried to perfection,
a few of our hints should be acted on as speedily as possible.

v52 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Among the fashionable parties of the season we have observed the fre-
quent announcement of a Thé Dansante, or a dancing tea, with which
our un-aristocratic readers may not happen to be familiar. The sort of
entertainment was new even to us; for though we had heard of fêtes al
fresco, or parties in the open air, which sometimes terminate in a pro-
menade pattenique or a walk home in pattens, as well as a soirée
brandy-and-water-esque, or a glass of grog at night to prevent one from
catching cold ; we must confess our ignorance, until lately, of a thé dan-
sante—the nearest approach to which seems to have been the capers cut
by a bull among the cups and saucers in a china-shop. Having, however
been honoured by an invitation from one of our aristocratic female
friends to a thé dansante, we went a few evenings ago to an entertainment
of the sort alluded to. We also took part in a set of Congou Quadrilles
and danced a Bohea-mian Polku, together with the Hyson Waltz and
Gunpowder Galop.
* The following description of the figures of the first set of Congou
Quadrilles may prove interesting to our fair readers, who will no doubt
introduce it at their soirees, as they would any other piece of eccentricity,
that had novelty and fashion to recommend it.
LA TASSE.
First gentleman advances, and hands cup to first lady, who retires;
and second gentleman does the same to second lady. Both gentlemen
chassez while bothiladies drink the tea, when the two ladies balancez to
the two gentlemen, who take the two cups and retire.
A THE DANSANTE.”
LA SouTASSE.
First lady advances with a saucer to first gentleman, who sets to her
with a cup ; the second couple do the same. Both gentlemen pour a
little tea into the two saucers. Ladies retire; and as the gentlemen
advance, the ladies empty the saucers. The ladies then advance, and
the gentlemen empty the cups, when each gentleman sets to his lady,
and all swing back to places.
LA THEIAERE.
First gentleman executes the pastorale movement with an empty cup
and saucer; first lady advances with teapot, and fills the cup, when first
gentleman swings round and retires. Second lady then advances with
milk-jug, and second gentleman' with sugar-basin; first gentleman
balances with cup, and second lady and gentleman set to him with the
milk and sugar; after which, both gentlemen turn their partners to
their places. -
-- LA CUILLIERE.
Grand round—in which each gentleman stirs his partner's tea, beating
time with the spoon against the saucer. The ladies advance with hands
a cross, and strike their spoons upon the brims of each other's cups. The
gentlemen then advance with their spoons, and place them in the first
Iady's cup, who swings round and retires. The first lady then sets to
all the gentlemen, each of whom takes his own spoon, and all swing round
to places. The same is done by the other couples, and there is a grand
round in which all stir their own tea; and, having drunk it off, during a
pause in the music, they all chassez croisez, and balancez once more ;
when the set of quadrilles is concluded.
THE CAT AT WINDSOR.
Within these few days, two men of the Coldstream Guards,
stationed at Windsor, have each received a hundred lashes. The
crime of the men originated in their refusal to strip themselves with
some sixty or seventy of their comrades, to be inspected—in a
crowd, like beasts—by the doctor. They were thereupon ordered
to the black-hole for what was considered a false and finical delicacy.
The men turned restive, when—presto 1–a court-martial was in-
stantly convened, and within two hours the men were “tried, sen-
tenced, punished, and taken to the hospital " If promotion in the
Army only came as quick as punishment!
The men (says the Chronicle) are stated “to be exceedingly steady,
and generally well-conducted.” But wherefore, HENRY SEY MAN
and WILLIAM Law RIN, being soldiers—wherefore endeavour to
retain any sense of decency — wherefore shrink from any self-
exposure ?, Have you not entered the Army; sold yourself as
machines; taken HER MAJEsty's bounty to render up not only
your bodies but your souls to the discipline of the service What
right have you over your own naked flesh, any more than the horse
that may be trotted out to show its points, at the will of its owner
sufferings were most severe; he blood trickling down their backs in streams after the
first fifteen or twenty lashes. Their comrades, who were drawn up in the square, looked
on in sullen silence. The moment they were dismissed, they gave vent to one loud
simultaneous hiss.” -- -
How very handsome is a regiment in all its flutter and glory of
flags and fine trappings Yet let us pick the regiment to pieces-
—reduce it to units—and what a miserable, soul-and-body, bartered
creature is the son of glory who, ºf his manhood revolt at indignity,
may be lashed like a brute!
Think of these matters—glory-loving youngster —especially think
of them, whensoever the recruiting serjeant may seek to tempt you
with the destroying shilling !
A CERTAIN convert.
Lond Brougham wrote, a day or two since, “No man in England hates
Popery more than I do.” We may therefore expect his lordship's
conversion in about six months.

MRS. CAUDLE'S CURTAIN LECTURES.
LECTURE XXVI.
MRS. CAUDLE'S FIRST NIGHT IN FRANCE. – “SHAMEFUL INDIF-
FERENCE * OF CAUDLE AT THE BOULOGNE CUSTOM HOUSE.
suppose, MR. CAUDLE, you call yourself a
man I’m sure, such men should never have
wives. If I could have thought it possible
you’d have behaved as you have done—and
I might, if I hadn’t been a forgiving creature,
for you’ve never been like anybody else—if
I could only have thought it, you’d never
have dragged me to foreign parts. Never !
Well, I did say to myself, if he goes to
France, perhaps he may catch a little polite-
ness—but no : you began as CAUDLE, and as
CAUDLE you’ll end. I’m to be neglected
through life, now. Oh yes! I’ve quite given
up all thoughts of anything but wretchedness
—I’ve made up my mind to misery, now.
You're glad of it? Well, you must have a heart to say that. I declare
to you, CAUDLE, as true as I’m an ill-used woman, if it wasn't for the
dear children far away in blessed England—if it wasn't for them,
I’d never go back with you. No : I’d leave you in this very place.
Yes; I’d go into a convent; for a lady on board told me there was
plenty of 'em here. I’d go and be a nun for the rest of my days, and
—I see nothing to laugh at, MR. CAUDLE ; that you should be
shaking the bed-things up and down in that way.—But you always
laugh at people's feelings; I wish you’d only some yourself. I’d be
a nun, or a Sister of Charity. Impossible? Ha, MR. CAUDLE, you
don’t know even now what I can be when my blood's up. You’ve
trod upon the worm long enough; some day won't you be sorry
for it !
“Now none of your profane cryings out ! You needn't talk about
Heaven in that way: I'm sure you’re the last person who ought.
What I say is this. Your conduct at the Custom House was shame-
ful—cruel! And in a foreign land, too ! But you brought me here
that I might be insulted; you’d no other reason for dragging me
from England. Hal let me once get home, MR. CAUDLE, and you
may wear your tongue out before you get me into outlandish places
again. What have you done? There now ; that’s where you’re so
aggravating. You behave worse than any Turk to me, what? You
wish you were a Turk? Well, I think that’s a pretty wish before your
lawful wife 1 Yes—a nice Turk you'd make, wouldn't you? Don't
think it.
“What hare you done? Well; it’s a good thing I can't see you, for
I’m sure you must blush. Done, indeed Why, when the brutes
searched my basket at the Custom House ! A regular thing, is it?
Then if you knew that, why did you bring me here 1 No man who
respected his wife, would. And you could stand by, and see that
fellow with mustachios rummage my basket; and pull out my night-
cap, and rumple the borders, and—well 1 if you’d had the proper
feelings of a husband, your blood would have boiled again. But no
There you stood looking as mild as butter at the man, and never said
a word; not when he crumpled my night-cap—it went to my heart
like a stab–crumpled it as if it was any duster. I daresay if it had
been Miss PRETTYMAN's night-cap—oh, I don't care about your
groaning—if it had been her night-cap, her hair-brush, her curl-
papers, you’d have said something then. Oh, anybody with the
spirit of a man would have spoken out if the fellow had had a thou-
sand swords at his side. Well, all I know is this: if I’d have married
somebody I could name, he wouldn't have suffered me to be treated
in that way, not he l
“Now, don't hope to go to sleep MR. CAUDLE, and think to silence
me in that manner. I know your art, but it won't do. It wasn't
enough that my basket was turned topsy-turvy, but before I knew it,
they spun me into another room, and—How could you help that You
never tried to help it. No ; although it was a foreign land, and I
don't speak French—not but what I know a good deal more of it
than some people who give themselves airs about it—though I don't
speak their nasty gibberish, still you let them take me away, and
never cared how I was ever to find you again. In a strange country,
too ! But I’ve no doubt that that’s what you wished : yes, you’d
have been glad enough to have got rid of me in that cowardly manner.
If I could only know your secret thoughts, CAUDLE, that’s what
you brought me here for; to lose me. And after the wife I’ve been
to you!
“What are you crying out ! For mercy's sake? Yes; a great deal
you know about mercy Else you’d never have suffered me to be
twisted into that room. To be searched, indeed . As if I’d any-
thing smuggled about me. Well, I will say it ; after the way in
which I’ve been used, if you'd the proper feelings of a man, you
wouldn't sleep again for six months. Well, I know there was nobody
but women there; but that’s nothing to do with it. I’m sure, if I’d
been taken up for picking pockets, they couldn't have used me worse.
To be treated so—and 'specially by one's own sex —it’s that that
aggravates me.
“And that’s all you can say ! What could you do? Why, break
open the door; I’m sure you must have heard my voice: you shall

At this genial season of the summer holidays, when Rowland recom-
mends that children's faces should be washed with his kalydor, and little
boys are at home with papa, is it not hard that the poor little rogues
should be reminded of their coming misery, by advertisements such as
the following :
AMPSTEAD-HEATH SCHOOL.-Messrs. and — expect
their young friends will resume their studies on the 26th inst.
Expect their young friends ! Unfortunate little dears It is cruel to
spoil holidays so, and in the midst of the midsummer festivities to show
our young friends the Hampstead Heath rod hanging over them.

ASSAULT ON THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON |
Assuredly, with Rowland HILL's blessing of the Penny Postage upon
us, a man is hardly justified in waylaying the DUKE of WELLINGTON in
his walks abroad, and thrusting upon him peremptory letters; the more
especially as his Grace has achieved a peculiar reputation as a punctual
and most terse correspondent. Nevertheless, we could wish that the
police were always as alert as, according to the Globe, they showed them-
selves, a day or two since, at the House of Lords. The Duke had dis-
mounted, when–
“A tall and able man, of rather decent appearance, and about 48 years of age, rushed
towards his Grace, and was in the act of thrusting a letter upon his Grace, when he was
instantly collared by two constables on duty, and drawn back.”
The man, we are further told, “was conveyed into the House in the
custody of the constables 1’, it being a gross offence to present a letter to
the DUKE of WELLINGTON in the street ! What became of the man we
cannot say ; it has, however, been suggested that he was possibly an old
Peninsular Officer, and the letter was intended to solicit the Duke's sup-
port of the petition for decorations, if this really be the truth, we have
no compassion for the offender: inasmuch as the Duke, after the old
managerial way, has said to the old Peninsular—“No orders will be issued
under any pretence whatever.”
THE CONJURESS OF COS.
[As it is probable that the poet BuNN will require a new opera for his next season,
and as all his subjects must be by this time exhausted, we are anxious to propose to
his attention an opera, which might be played during the period of his taking breathing
time for his next inspiration. Should any resemblance to that combination of British
and * talent, The Enchantress, be discovered, we entreat the indulgence of the
critic.
Scene.—The Sea-Coast in the Island of Cos. To the right of the

Timnic. Ah! how odd it is that so good a creature should always
travel in the shell of a nauti-lus !
A nautilus-shell appears with CiRCE, who rows it gracefully with her
hand. Presently she steps out and comes to foreground, while
village-girls come to meet her. The shell is drawn off.

to the ear of CIRce, fires it, and runs off.

The shell instantly appears at a very remote ºs

THE QUEEN AND THE MILLINERS.
WE were much distressed on reading a letter from “a Dress-
maker,” in the Times, complaining that HER MAJESTY (and, of
course, the Duchesses, and others,) “prefer having their dresses
made by French women, instead of English.” We think this is a
cruel libel on the QUEEN, and is to be traced to the same malignant
source from which we continually hear that “HER MAJEsty last
night honoured the French performances with her presence”—
“HER MAJEsty last night attended the Italian Opera”—“HER
MAJEsty last night had a concert solely of German and Italian
music,”—and so forth, with evidently an attempt to impose a belief
upon the generous British nation that the QUEEN does not to the
very limits of her time and means patronise the arts and industry
of her own country. There is great wickedness in this calumny ;
but, merely for the play of argument, let us suppose that HER
MAJEsty receives half her wardrobe ready-made from France; and
that the other half, made in England, is made by milliners from
Paris—what of it? Has not HER MAJESTY subscribed, we believe,
as much as 50l. to the “Society of Distressed English Needle-
women?” Patronage may be very well, but is not charity a much
nobler quality ?
The aforesaid “Dressmaker” asks if it does not occur to Lord
AshLEY (who refused to meddle with the question of French mil-
liners, as, we presume, disrespectful to the throne) that—
“If the most profitable part of the dress-making business is monopolised by
foreigners, Englishwomen, although fully capable of executing it, are of necessity driven
into the ranks of plain needle-workers? Again, if ladies of fortune, who now employ
their maids (who are required to have a thorough knowledge of dressmaking), were to
put their work out, would not this give more remunerative employment to many needle-
women who now do plain work because they cannot get better to do, owing to this per-
nicious patronage of foreigners?”
The “Dress-maker” is evidently a homely, uncultivated person,
incapable of appreciating the great truth, that the French have
been created a favoured race. They were sent into the world
for the sole purpose of giving the laws of millinery to every civilised
land—whilst the mere Englishwoman was sent as the drudge, the
slave, the vassal of plain needlework. It is only people born in the
very highest ranks who can understand this subtle truth; and
understanding it, they try, so far as truth may be improved, to
improve it. It has been well said, and often quoted, that—“Property
has its duties as well as its rights " its first duty being, of course, to
increase and multiply itself. Hence, fulfilling this duty, ladies of
fortune combine the lady's-maid with the milliner, very wisely
putting one domestic piece of human furniture to two uses; just as
often may be found in the houses of the lower orders a piece of
joinery, that is—“a bed by night, a chest of drawers by day.”
And hence, fulfilling this duty, golden Marquises employ no west-end
tailor for their children, but take their tender offspring to the soul-
* starving tailors, BARABBAs and SoN, somewhere in the
ity.
THE M.P. ON THE RAILWAY COMMITTEE.
DEDICATED TO ALFRED TENNYSON.
WITH shareholders in anxious lots,
The rooms were crowded one and all,
The Barristers stood round in knots—
And quite forsook Westminster Hall.
Sections and plans looked odd and strange
And the M.P. at each new batch,
Weary and worn, looked at his watch,
In hopes the counsel to derange.
He only said, “It’s very dreary:
He’ll never stop !” he said ;
He said “I’m a-weary—a-weary,
I would I were in bed l’”
The speech began before eleven,
And might go on till eventide;
He must be in the House at seven,
Upon a motion to divide.
The Barristers in white cravats
Unto each other gave the lie;
The M.P. sadly shut his eye
And thought of the Kilkenny cats.
He only said, “It’s very dreary:
They’ll never stop !” he said;
He said, “I’m a-weary, a-weary,
And must not go to bed.”
Until the middle of the night,
He'd heard the Irish Members crow ;
The House broke up in broad daylight,
Heavily he to bed did go,
In hopes to sleep: but without change,
In dreams, he seemed to hear, forlorn,
The Barrister he'd heard that morn;
And saw, in slumber, sections strange.
He sighed and said, “”Tis very dreary :
I cannot sleep !” he said ;
He said, “I am a-weary, a-weary,
Both in and out of bed.”
And when the temperature was low,
And DR. REID out of the way; - -
The hot and cold blasts to and fro,
In the committee-room did play.
When first returned, he didn't know
He should of work have such a spell;
His seat, in fact, had proved a sell;
He wouldn't stay, he couldn't go.
And then he said, “It’s very dreary :
I won't stand this ' " he said;
He said, “I am weary, a-weary,
The counsel will talk me dead.”
. . The hot sun beating on the roof,
The slow clock ticking, and the sound
Which in opposing lines' behoof
The counsel made—did all confound
His sense : then longed he for the hour
When their report they came to lay
Before the Commons; and the day
On which he'd 'scape SiR Robert's power.
Then said he, “This is far too dreary:
I will retire ; ” he said ;
He sighed, “I am so weary, a-weary,
I'll go to jail instead.”
A HOUSE AT THE WEST END.
SIR,-I saw lately an advertisement in the Times of a house to be let
in a street leading out of a fashionable square in the West End–Rent,
65l. per annum.
Wishing to reside in the district which the rest of the nobility inhabit,
and the price appearing moderate, I wrote to the auctioneer who adver-
tised the house.
He sends me back a card to view a house situate in—, Silver Street,
Golden Square.
I inclose the card. Have I no remedy against a wretch who insults me
in this way

THE POLITICAL PAS DE QUATRE.
Scancely anything can exceed the excitement occasioned by the appearance of four
rival dancers in the same Pas de Quatre, but a still greater sensation has been caused
by the bringing together of four political figurantes, all taking the same steps in a
Pas de Quatre of the most astounding character. The dance included a variety of
surprising groupings, in the course of which the performers threw themselves into
the most difficult positions, and a variety of combinations occurred such as had never
before been heard of in the annals of political capering. PEEL in the Maynooth
shuffle actually surpassed himself, at one moment taking a graceful slide from
one side to the other, then executing a 'rapid pirouette, and taking Russell as his
partner, giving him a sudden twist round with remarkable energy.
But perhaps the great wonder of the Pas de Quatre consisted in the variations
of BRough AM. He bounded about with a reckless wildness that took the House
by surprise, and excited a perfect tumult among the audience. He came out very
gracefully in the exquisite little solo hit called the Pas de Privilege, and exhibited
a steadiness in this one particular movement which he is not always famous for. The
share taken by O'Connell was not the happiest part of the Pas de Quatre. His
advancing and retiring towards PEEL was, perhaps, the best movement, but the small
variation, called the Pas de Repeal, was a dead failure. The concluding group in
which all the four political dancers threw themselves into one tableau of harmony, was
the crowning wonder of this great political Terpsichorean incident.
City &ntiquities.
THERE is opposite the end of Chancery Lane, and just over the entrance of that
repository of legal learning, disregarded genius, and attorney-generals that ought to
be—the Temple, a house now occupied as a hair-dresser's, but formerly, if we are to
believe the proprietor, the palace of HENRY THE Eighth and CARDINAL Wolsey. We
were not aware that Wolsey and HENRY THE Eighth had apartments in the same
house, but it is possible that there may have been a little brass plate on the door-post
directing people to “Ring the top bell for the Cardinal.” HENRY THE EIGHTH no
doubt occupied the first floor, with the attics and the use of the front kitchen, which
would have left the whole of the two-pair and the wash-house to his good Lord Cardinal.
There is no doubt that Wolsey and his Royal master carried on some rare games
when they lived in Fleet Street, and it is believed that the Mitre first took its name
from its having been the constant haunt of the Cardinal. There are some funny stories
still told by one of the old waiters at the Rainbow of how HARRY used to order a cup
of sack, and joke Wolsey, who then held the great seal, about giving him the sack,
a jibe which the unhappy Chancellor was ultimately compelled to experience the
realisation of.
Wolsey, as we are told by the ingenious PINNock, “sung, laughed, and danced with
every libertine of the court;” but we are not told in which of the many courts in the
neighbourhood the roystering Cardinal carried on his gambols. We presume that the
cardinal virtues are so called on the lucus à non lucendo principle, from no Cardinal
having any virtues at all, which at least was the case with Wolsey. He always wore
a large comforter round his neck, and it is believed that the word Linsey Wolsey had
its origin in this circumstance.

A Most dangerous interrogative this to put to a police-

man named CortRELL was brought to Clerkenwell, Office
“as a suspected person.” He was walking home with two
baskets in his hands, having been out fishing. Policeman
ANDERson asked what was in them? “What's that ſto
you !” answered the hardened offender; whereupon, he
was taken past his own door to the station-house, and
locked up. He was then brought before the wizard GREEN-
wood, who “discharged him.” We therefore presume it
is lawful for any policeman to stop man, woman, ºr child, on
the way with a pie to the bakehouse, and ask, “What have
you got there 1” and then, upon the refusal of the party to
lift off the crust, and show the fruit or steaks, as the case
may be, to carry the recusant straightway, before Mr.
GREENwood, who, with that wisdom which daily endears |
him to Sir JAMEs GRAHAM, will “discharge” the trans-

A LUCKY SPECULATOR.
“Coxsiderable sensation has been excited in the upper and lower circles in the
West End, by a startling piece of good fortune which has befallen JAMEs Plush, Esq.,
lately footman in a respected family in Berkeley Square. - -
“One day last week, MR. JAMss waited upon his master, who is a banker in the
City; and after a little blushing and hesitation, said he had saved a little money in
service, was anxious to retire, and to invest his savings to advantage. . . -
“His master (we believe we may mention, without offending delicacy, the well-
known name of Sir George Flimsy, of the house of Fºixºsy, Diopush, and
Flash,) smilingly asked Mr. James what was the amount of his saving, . wondering
considerably how, cut of an income of thirty guineas—the main º of which he spent
, bouquets, silk stockings, and perfumery–MR. Plush could have managed to lay by
anything. -
“Mr. Plush, with some hesitation, said he had been speculating in railroads, and
stated his winnings to have been thirty thousand pounds. He had commenced his
speculations with twenty, borrowed from a fellow-servant. He had dated his letters
from the house in Berkeley Square, and humbly begged pardon of his master for not
*::: * the Railway'Secretaries who answered his applications to apply at
the area-bcll.
“SIR GEorce, who was at breakfast, instantly rose, and shook MR. P. by the hand;
LADY Flimsy begged him to be seated, and partake of the breakfast which he had laid
on the table; and has subsequently invited him to her grand déjeuner at Richmond,
where it was observed that Miss EMILY Flimsy, her beautiful and accomplished seventh
daughter, paid the lucky gentleman marked attention.
“We hear it stated that M.R. P. is of a very ancient family, (Hugo DE LA Pluche
came over with the Conqueror); and the new Brougham which he has started, bears the
ancient coat of his race.
“He has taken apartments in the Albany, and is a director of thirty-three railroads,
He purposes to stand for Parliament at the next general election on decidedly con-
servative principles, which have always been the politics of his family.
“Report says, that even in his humble capacity Miss EMILY FLIMsy had remarked
his high demeanour. Well, “none but the brave,” say we, “deserve the fair.’”—

This announcement will explain the following lines, which have been
put into our box with a West-End post-mark. If, as we believe, they
are written by the young woman from whom the Millionaire borrowed
the sum on which he raised his fortune, what heart will not melt with
sympathy at her tale, and pity the sorrows which she expresses in such
artless language 1
If it be not too late; if wealth have not rendered its possessor callous:
if poor MARYANNE be still alive; we trust, we trust, MR. Plush will do
her justice.
JEAMES OF BUCKLEY SQUARE.
A HELIGY.
Come all ye gents vot cleans the plate,
Come all ye ladies maids so fair—
Wile I a story vil relate
Of cruel JEAMEs of Buckley Square.
A tighter lad, it is confest,
Neer valked with powder in his air,
Or wore a nosegay in his breast,
Than andsum JEAMEs of Buckley Square.
O Evns 1 it was the best of sights,
Behind his Master's coach and pair,
To see our JEAMEs in red plush tights,
A driving hoff from Buckley Square.
He vel became his hagwiletts,
He cocked his at with such a hair;
His calves and viskers was such pets,
That hall loved JEAMEs of Buckley Square.
He pleased the hup-stairs folks as well,
And ol I withered vith despair,
Misses would ring the parler bell,
And call up JEAMEs in Buckley Square.
Both beer and sperrits he abhord,
(Sperrits and beer I can't a bear,)
You would have thought he was a lord
Down in our All in Buckley Square.
Last year he visper'd, “MARY HANN,
Wen I've an under'd pound to spare,
To take a public is my plan,
And leave this hojous Buckley Square.”
O how my gentle heart did bound,
To think that I his name should bear.
“Dear JEAMEs,” says I, “I’ve twenty pound,”
And gev them him in Buckley Square.
Our master vas a City gent,
His name's in railroads everywhere ;
And lord, vot lots of letters vent -
Betwigst his brokers and Buckley Square :
My JEAMEs it was the letters took,
And read 'em all, (I think it's fair,)
And took a leaf from Master's book,
As hothers do in Buckley Square.
Encouraged with my twenty pound,
Of which poor I was unavare,
He wrote the Companies all round,
And signed hisself from Buckley Square.
And how John Porten used to grin,
As day by day, share after share,
Came railway letters pouring in,
“J. Plush, Esquire, in Buckley Square.”
Our servants' All was in a rage—
Scrip, stock, curves, gradients, bull and bear,
With butler, coachman, groom and page,
Was all the talk in Buckley Square.
But O ! imagine vat I felt
Last Wensdy veek as ever were;
I gits a letter, which I spelt
“Mis M. A. Hoggins, Buckley Square.”
He sent me back my money true—
He sent me back my lock of air,
And said, “My dear, I bid ajew
To MARY HANN and Buckley Square.
Think not to marry, foolish HANN,
With people who your betters are ;
JAMES Plush is now a j
And you—a cook in Buckley Square.
“I’ve thirty thousand guineas won,
In six short months, by genus rare;
You little thought what JEAMEs was on,
Poor MARY HANN, in Buckley Square.
I’ve thirty thousand guineas net,
Powder and plush I scorn to vear;
And so, Miss MARY HANN, forget
For hever JEAMEs, of Buckley Square.”

A little further on we come to Richard CoEUR DE Lion, planting the Standard of

OUR own little snug suburban railway, comprising the great trunk-line
from Warwick Square to Wormwood Scrubs, with projected branches to
the Addison Road and Lord Holland's Lane, carried by a tunnel through
the common sewer, and a series of gradients over an adjacent hedge,
connecting the coal-wharf in the south with the riding-school on the
north-east, and the public-house on the west—this delicious little
railway-ette has been under discussion by a committee of the House of
Lords, of which our friend Bhougham was chairman. Punch having
quizzed the Kensington Railway, BRough AM thought it would be good fun
to quiz the witnesses, and he consequently commenced mistaking an archi-
tect, who came to give evidence about the building of a station, for a
market gardener, who wished to prove that the line would cut through a
bed of strawberries, and that the tunnelling would annihilate a lot of very
promising summer cabbages.
His Lordship, on seeing the architect taking the oath, exclaimed with
much vehemence, “Who's this BEAzley, the market-gardener, I
suppose;” and had almost plunged into a series of queries as to the effect
of a railway on the price of a peck of peas or a pound of new potatoes,
when the learned counsel suggested to the noble chairman, that the gen-
tleman about to be examined, was an architect, and not a market-gardener.
His Lordship was very anxious to know why everybody did not buy
everybody else out, and gave all the parties time to pay each other's
demands, for which purpose an adjournment was agreed upon.
We understand that the proprietor of the apple-stall at the two-and-a-
half milestone, insists on compensation for the smoke of the one engine,
which blacks her apples and knocks nearly a farthing a lot off the value
of them. One of the directors came and sat upon the board—where her
apples are placed for sale—to talk it over with her, but no compromise
could be effected.
THE COLOSSEUM .
HIS splendid pile of architectural stucco, which rears its proud dome of zinc towards a
Regent's Parkian sky, was on the eve of being crumbled to atoms beneath the hammer of
the auctioneer, when it was suddenly snatched from its impending fate by the hand of a
capitalist and the eye of an artist. The classic ground on which the Colosseum stands
was about to be actually covered with ordinary houses, and a row of common-place
structures would have filled the spot hallowed by the truly Roman recollections which
extend from the Camera Obscura, on the south, to the Lodge, on the north, of the
Fortunately, however, the classic eye of BRADwell saw the site, and
He could not bear the horrible idea of kitchen sinks
BRADwell recollected the prediction—
“While stands the Colosseum, Rome shall stand; ”
and it occurred to him that the stability of London might depend on the same contingency.
There can be no doubt that unless the Colosseum in the Regent's Park continues to
stand, London, which is exhibited inside, must inevitably perish.

our eye with the weathercock to every point of the compass, for “we shall never look upon
its like,” or anything like its like, “again.”
On entering the portico, and turning to the left, we get into a corridor, which we may,
if we like, fancy is the entrance to the Vatican.
Having dropped a tear over the fate of the six unfortunate popes, we rush forward
into the refreshment-room, and seek consolation in Bath-buns and cherry-brandy.
next find ourselves in the Glyptotheca, or Museum of Sculpture, formerly called the
Saloon of Arts, from its having been artfully covered in with calico : the old Saloon of
Arts used to be pitch dark, and was well supplied with old newspapers, which, as it was
impossible to see to read them, were as good as new to the visitors.
BRADwell has effected a truly fairy change ; and in place of the old original temporary
booth of pink cotton, we have now a magnificent circular saloon, fitted up with works of
sculpture from the studios of some of the most eminent sculptors. But while the mind
may feast, our physical refreshment has not been neglected, for there peeps from beneath
the tapestry — nestling under tasteful hangings of silk—a snug little stall, where the
joyous Banbury, and the cheerful jam-puff may be had by asking—and paying-for.

been as fat as the sculptor has made him.

his hand from having fallen asleep over it.
Among the works of art, we find a design for the NElson Monument,
which is almost as good as-

It shows NEPTUNE handing up a wreath on the end of a toasting-fork to
BRITANNIA, who offers it to Nelson; but as he has got his hands full of
swords and flags, he of course is unable to take it. It is a graceful notion
gracefully executed.
Having examined the sculpture, we take our places in the Ascending
Room, and commence our aerial flight to the summit of St. Paul's, and
step into the outer gallery. There is London by day, but ere a few hours
have passed, London by night will extinguish it. The effect of this latter
picture is so wonderful, that a visitor would not believe the sky to be
artificial, and insisted, that the twinkling luminaries had been engaged to
star it expressly for the occasion.
If BRADwell can only make such another moon, and lend it out to us,
to be placed in the back yard that looks upon our garret window, we will
give him any money—that we can spare—for the use of it. He might
assuredly take out a patent for perpetual moonlight all through the year.
And when we see his real moon made of nothing but canvas, we begin to
have some faith in the project for extracting sunbeams from cucumbers.
But now let us pause. We have walked out into the property temples
that surround the building. , MARIus among the ruins of Carthage is a
fool to Punch among the ruins at the Colosseum. To make some of the
ruins of antiquity, Time has lent a slow hand; but here we have classical
associations and columns knocked up, or rather knocked down, in no time.
We almost smiled—if we could allow ourselves to smile when under the
shadow of the tottering pillars around us—we almost smiled at the
request to the public “not to touch the ruins.” If it is desirable to have
a ruinous effect, surely it would be in aecordance with the genius loci if
the visitors were to begin ruining the ruins around them.

selves in the land of the CID. But lo! the old parrot on the left is making

splendid than GroRGE IV.'s opposition at Westminster Abbey, and
BRADwell's Stalactite Cavern at the Colosseum surpasses in stalacticity
and splendour the German original.
In conclusion, we have to recommend every one heartily, if he has four
shillings to spare, to pay a visit to the Colosseum. If he has not four
shillings to spare, let him come to us, and if he can give us good security,
and a hundred per cent. interest in advance, with a small bonus in addi-
tion when the principal is repaid, we will lend him the money.

A FEW SUPPOSITIONS."
It is a pity that the two Houses of Parliament are continually going to
loggerheads about the question of privilege, instead of laying their wise
heads together and settling it. It would really be satisfactory to know
when one is committing a breach of privilege, and when not. At present
a breach of privilege would seem to be anything that gives, offence to
either House. This consideration suggests a few suppositions to us. Sup-
pose the minority in one House should offend the majority, would the
majority have the power of committing the minority Suppose the Com-
mons should offend the Lords, would the Lords be empowered to commit
the Commons : Suppose, as would naturally be the case, the Lords were
also to offend the Commons, would the Commons, at the same time, be
entitled to commit the Lords? What power in the Executive would
effect the committal? Would the prisoners be confined to their respective
Houses, or would one body be sent to the Compter, and the other to
Newgate
Suppose either House should claim the power of fine as well as impri-
sonment. Suppose it went a little further, and asserted that of life and
| death. Suppose it declared its members irresponsible for their deeds, as
well as for their debts. Suppose, in short, it assumed the right to do

he English are gullible people: there is no doubt
of it. Let NERo himself rise from the dust,
and fiddle at HER MAJESTY's Theatre
(how the royal box would be crammed to
hear such a foreigner 1) and we should
forget the tyrant in the condescension of
the emperor. The KING of PRussia, on
his late visit to England, swindled us right
and left of our good opinion. He went
down upon his knees in Newgate with
good MRs. FRY, and the feminine turnkeys
lapsed into hysterics at his humility. The
hearts of the female felons were melted
like butter at the royal goodness. His
MAJESTY worked such wonders in New-
gate, that pity, indeed, was it for frail and
sinful humanity, that his stay was so very
brief within the prison walls. He left our
shores, as we thought, a meek-hearted
Christian; and he no sooner got home
than he played the KING with a new
swagger; put an extra gag on the press;
and became hunter of the Poles for his
great exemplar Nicholas. The last news
from Munich communicates a new in-
stance of the magnanimity of the royal
Diddler. On the 5th inst a composer of
Berlin, “publicly, in the open court, made
an humble apology before the King's pic-
ture.” We are told that the musician
“had been condemned to this punishment,
and a year's confinement,for having spoken
disrespectfully of His MAJESTY 1” After
all, it might have been a latent sense of humility in the KING that made
the offender apologise to the royal portrait: that could not blush for the
petty tyranny of the very small original. .
THE AMENDE HONORABLE.
The Holbein is restored to its nail, and Punch has not spoken in
vain.
The seller would not accept the 200l. bonus. Perhaps this may have
something to do with the return of the picture.
He has written to the Times a more bitterly satirical letter than suits
his position in life. After stating that the unfortunate picture is hung
again where it was before quartered, a position it owes very naturally to
its execution, he goes on—
“It will be readily perceived that insidious intriguing had alone shaken for a moment
the opinion of the guardians of public taste, which board of noblemen has resumed its
proud position, and set at nought all intrigue.”
Hip, hip, Huzzal Huzza, Huzza, Huzza Three cheers for the dis-

“white” into the left, and the “board of noblemen” in their “proud

between the two bundles of hay. -
Again we say, happy is England, which has noblemen for the trustees
of her National Gallery, with artists to advise the noblemen, and dealers
to guide the artist; a sort of “King, Lords, and Commons” of artistic
questions, producing a balance like that of our famous constitution, where

MRS. CAUDLE'S CURTAIN LECTURES.
• MRS. CAUDLE RETURNS TO HER NATIVE LAND. “ UNMANLY CRU-
ELTY” OF CAUDLE, WHO HAS REFUSED “TO SMUGGLE A FEW
Things." FOR HER.
LECTURE XXVII.
HERE, it isn't often that I ask you to do
anything for me, MR. CAUDLE, goodness
knows 1 and when I do, I'm always
refused—of course. Oh yes l anybody
W but your own lawful wife. Every other
husband aboard the boat could behave
like a husband—but I was left to shift
for myself. To be sure, that’s nothing
new ; I always am. Every other man,
worthy to be called a man, could smuggle
a few things for his wife—but I might
as well be alone in the world. Not one
poor half-dozen of silk stockings could
you put in your hat for me; and every-
body else was rolled in lace, and I don’t
know what. Eh What, MR. CAUDLE | What do I want with silk
stockings Well,—it's come to something now ! There was a time,
I believe, when I had a foot—yes, and an ankle, too : but when once
a woman’s married, she has nothing of the sort; of course. No :
I'm not a cherub, MR. CAUDLE ; don't say that. I know very well
what I am.
“I dare say now, you'd have been delighted to smuggle for Miss
PRETTYMAN ? Silk stockings become her You wish Miss Prettyman
was in the moon 2 Not you, MR. CAUDLE ; that’s only your art—your
hypocrisy. A nice person too she’d be for the moon: it would be
none the brighter for her being in it, I know. And when you saw
the Custom House officers look at me, as though they were piercing
me through, what was your conduct Shameful. You twittered
about, and fidgetted, and flushed up as if I really was a smuggler.
So I was 2 What had that to do with it? It wasn't the part of a
husband, I think, to fidget in that way, and show it. You couldn't
help it? Humph 1 And you call yourself a person of strong mind,
I believe? One of the lords of the creation l Ha! hal Couldn't
help it !
“But I may do all I can to save the money, and this is always my
reward. Yes, MR. CAUDLE, I shall save a great deal. How much?
I sha’n’t tell you: I know your meanness—you’d want to stop it out
of the house-allowance. No : it’s nothing to you where I got the
money from to buy so many things. The money was my own. Well,
and if it was yours first, that’s nothing to do with it. No ; I hav'n't

who’s despised. It's only your fine-lady wives who're properly
thought of. If I was to ruin you, CAUDLE, then you'd think
something of me.
“I sha'n't go to sleep. It's very well for you who're no sooner in
bed, than you’re fast as a church ; but I can't sleep in that way.
It’s my mind keeps me awake. And, after all, I do feel so happy
to-night, it’s very hard I can't enjoy my thoughts. No: I can't
think in silence 1 There’s much enjoyment in that, to be sure I’ve
no doubt now you could listen to Miss PRETTYMAN–oh, I don't
care, I will speak. It was a little more than odd, I think, that she
should be on the jetty when the boat came in. Ha! she’d been
looking for you all the morning with a telescope, I’ve no doubt—
she’s bold enough for anything. And then how she sneered and
giggled when she saw me, and said “how fat I’d got :’ like her
impudence, I think. What 1 Well she might But I know what she
wanted; yes—she’d have liked to have had me searched. She laughed
on purpose.
“I only wish I’d taken two of the dear girls with me. What
things I could have stitched about 'em 1 No—I’m not ashamed of
myself to make my innocent children smugglers : the more innocent
they looked, the better; but there you are with what you call your
principles again; as if it wasn't given to everybody by nature to
smuggle. I’m sure of it—it's born with us. And nicely I’ve
cheated 'em this day. Lace, and velvet, and silk stockings, and other
things, to say nothing of the tumblers and decanters. No : I
didn’t look as if I wanted a direction, for fear somebody should break
me. That’s another of what you call your jokes; but you should
keep ’em for those who like 'em. I don’t
“What have I made, after all 2 I’ve told you—you shall never
know. Yes, I know you’d been fined a hundred pounds if they’d
searched me ; but I never meant that they should. I dare say you
wouldn't smuggle—oh no l you don’t think it worth your while.
You're quite a conjuror, you are, CAUDLE. Ha! haſ haſ What
am I laughing at 2 Oh, you little know—such a clever creature Ha!
haſ Well, now, I’ll tell you. I knew what an unaccommodating
creature you were, so I made you smuggle whether or not. How
Why, when you were out at the Café, I got your great rough coat,
and if I didn't stitch ten yards of best black velvet under the lining
I’m a sinful woman And to see how innocent you looked when
the officers walked round and round you ! It was a happy moment,
CAUDLE, to see you.
“What do you call it? A shameful trick,-unworthy of a wife? I couldn't
care much for you? As if I didn't prove that, by trusting you with
ten yards of velvet. But I don't care what you say: I’ve saved
everything—all but that beautiful English novel, that I've forgot
the name of. And if they didn't take it out of my hand, and cut it
to bits like so much dog's-meat. Serred me right? And when I so
seldom buy a book 1 No: I don’t see how it served me right. If
you can buy the same book in France for four shillings that people
here have the impudence to ask more than a guinea for—well, if
they do steal it, that's their affair, not ours. As if there was any-
thing in a book to steal |
“And now, CAUDLE, when are you going home? What? Our
time isn't up. That’s nothing to do with it. If we even lose a week's
lodging—and we mayn't do that—we shall save it again in living.
But you’re such a man Your home’s the last place with you.
I’m sure I don’t get a wink of a night, thinking what may happen.
Three fires last week; and any one might as well have been at our
house as not. No-they mightn't 2 Well, you know what I mean—
but you’re such a man I
“I’m sure, too, we’ve had quite enough of this place. But
there's no keeping you out of the libraries, CAUDLE. You’re
getting quite a gambler. And I don't think it’s a nice example to
set to your children, raffling as you do for French clocks and I don't
know what. But that’s not the worst; you never win anything.
Oh, I forgot. Yes; a needle-case, that under my nose you gave to
Miss PRETTYMAN. A nice thing for a married man to make
presents: and to such a creature as that, too. A needle-case 1 I
wonder whenever she has a needle in her hand 1
“I know I shall feel ill with anxiety if I stop here. Nobody left
in the house but that MRs. Close peg. And she is such a stupid
woman. It was only last night that I dreamt I saw our cat quite a
skeleton, and the canary stiff on its back at the bottom of the cage.
You know, CAUDLE, I’m never happy when I’m away from home ;
and yet you will stay here. No, home’s my comfort; I never want
to stir over the threshold, and you know it. If thieves were to
break in, what could that MRs. Close PEG do against 'em And so,
CAUDLE, you’ll go home on Saturday : Our dear—dear home On
Saturday, CAUDLE *
“What I answered,” says CAUDLE, “I forget; but I know that
on the Saturday, we were once again shipped on board the Red
Rover.”
REFORM OF THE BAR.
We are happy to state that the barristers of the Oxford Circuit have, at
length, resolved to vindicate the dignity of the Bar, and to show a bright
example to the whole of their silver-tongued and unsophisticated brethren.
They have come to an expressed resolution that it is beneath the character
of any of them “to report law proceedings for the press.” And following
up this beginning in the right path, they have also resolved, that if it
shall happen that any counsel receive a retaining fee to conduct a case
which, from a press of business, he shall be unable to advocate, it will
henceforth be considered a breach of the merest every-day honesty not
to return the money. Indeed, it is said that this resolution is to have a
retrospective effect, in which case considerable sums must be paid back.
We shall be happy to advertise the day on which learned gentlemen
propose to disgorge.
Reproving the Follies of the Age.
WHEN anything very outrageous or ridiculous is built, it is generally
called in the neighbourhood “A Folly.” Thus we have throughout
England a number of architectural absurdities, known as “BRiggs's
Folly,” “Jones's Folly,” “Thompson's Folly,” &c. But the greatest
folly of all in the building way is unquestionably Trafalgar Square.
Might it not be called henceforth “ENGLAND's Folly”

I Have not been unmindful of the quarrel which has lately
broken out between yourselves and the Bar. I even prophesy from
it considerable public benefit; if, as late circumstances have given me
to suppose, you are beginning to be aware of the importance of your
calling, to feel your own strength as a public body, to take counsel by
other corporations how to make your own respected, and to submit
to no further impudence or insult when you can conveniently
repress it. My soul rejoices in the prospect of a war between
the Bar and the Press of these kingdoms. As a member of the
latter profession, I am of course disposed impartially to stand by my
friends. Yes, in this row, or in any other where your interests are
menaced, there's a cudgel in Fleet Street, ready to make play for
the common cause.
I have just been reading in Fraser's Magazine, the biography of a
great leader of the enemy, who has lately passed away.
“The greatest skill of Follett,” FRASER says, “consisted in presenting
his case in the most harmonious and fair-purposed aspect, if there was
anything false or fraudulent, a hitch or a blot of any kind in his case, he
kept it dexterously out of view, or hurried it trippingly over. But if the
blot was on the other side, he had the eye of the lynx, and the scent of
ing so much like gentlemanly candour, that you could not find fault.”
Thus it is that the writer, a barrister evidently, eulogises the
various qualities which raised that eminent man; and complacently
enumerates his merits. He could play the “artful dodge” in a man.

statue flung down, and the great Iconoclast waving his baton over

This however for future consideration and other ages. Return we

Has it not often struck you, considering these things, how cruelly
the Attorneys have been dealt with by public repute—how, by our-
daily life, that class of men has come to be considered as a dangerous,
slippery, wicked set of practitioners When we talk of roguish
lawyers, as talk we do—lawyers are supposed to mean attorneys-
get such large fees, they become barons and earls so often ; above
all, they prate so magnificently and constantly about their own
honour and dignity, that the public believes them ; they reap the
dignity, and the poor attorney comes in for all the odium.
And yet, these men are but the creatures of the Attorneys: they
go where the latter bid them, they state what the Attorneys tell
them. If Quirk, GAMM on and SNAP prescribe the “artful dodge.”
SERJEANT BuzFus performs it in Court. If an honest man is to be
bullied in a witness-box, the barrister is instructed to bully him. If a

Courvoisi ER's case. If a naughty woman is to be screened, a
barrister will bring Heaven itself into Court, and call Providence to
witness that she is pure and spotless, as a certain great advocate and
schoolmaster abroad did for a certain lamented QUEEN CARoll NE.
There they are to be sold to the first bidder, these folks of the
long robe. Other bona robas are sent to the spinning-house for doing
no worse; and these—these mount to the peerage and the woolsack
—these talk about the dignity and independence of their profession
forsooth—these say that a man connected with their profession shan't
report for the newspapers.
It's dishonourable to do that. They'll turn a man from their
mess who reports in a paper; they’ll expel a man from their spot-
less society for reporting in the Times or the Morning Chronicle.
They do not expel a man for disgusting hypocrisy; for bear-
ing false witness; for the “artful dodge”; for keeping “fraud
and falsehood” out of view—they load him with honours for it.
Each of the instances above mentioned, has risen high to rank and
respect. This is a Law adviser to Ministers; that was a Minister of
the Crown; the other went to the grave with five hundred weeping
reputable gentlemen at his back—honest gentlemen who will have
no connection with the Press.
Very well. Let the Press be warned, and suffer, as best it may,
this separation from the Bar. Poor Peri turned out of Paradise,
peep in and see how the periwigged angels there innocently disport
themselves | Peep in and see them at their work : this one doing
the “artful dodge”; that one screening the frauds of his client;
another howling over the fate of a murderer who gives him so many
hundred guineas; another insulting a timid witness, or accusing an
innocent woman.—See all these things, O Press Send your com-
missioners in the train of these spotless men of law—and have your
say. There is no call for politeness, no truce or friendship hence-
forth between you. You are not worthy to sit at the Bar table;
dangerous society for dignified and independent gentlemen. Very
well; be you dignified and independent too. Bear this in mind,
gentlemen of the Press, that the Bar disowns you : and in the pro-
vinces, when the flock of barristers comes squeezing into your
Assize-Courts, hankering after your attorneys’ fees; ready to perform
the “artful dodge” for the rogues in your gaols; or to blubber over
murderers in the dock, welcome them as their dignity and indepen-
dence warrants. Don't fail to point out their eminent merits. Hold
up their respectability to public admiration.
So it is possible that from this war between the Bar and the Press
some good may arise: so it is possible that from this falling out some
honest men may come by their own; which is the fervent wish of
the benevolent

SALE OF WAUXHALL GARDENS.
UT a number or two back we alluded to
the possibility of this splendid property
being submitted to the hammer, and we
are sorry to say that a few days ago our
worst fears were realised. The Gardens
were put up to public competition, but
the public having refused to compete, the
lots were all bought in one after the
other. As, however, some parties might
be disposed to blame the auctioneer for
a lack of eloquence, we had a reporter
in attendance, who took down his speech
verbatim in short hand, and we give it as
a fine specimen of Ciceronian oratory.
“Now, then, where's the catalogue Ahem 1 Ladies and Gentlemen,
—I’ve got no ink-My Friends, that is, Ladies and Gentlemen,_I have
had the honour of being solicited to offer these Gardens—Where's Jim
I shall want him presently—for sale. They are very ancient. As you
all know—Get me a jug of water and a glass—the PRINCE of WALEs and
the Royal Dukes were constant visitors.
“The first lot to which I shall call your attention is the supper pavilion.
What shall I say for the supper pavilion ? Did any one say a thousand
pounds ! Why, gentlemen, the tarpaulin at the top is worth half the
money.—Is JIM coming with that water?—The splendid, substantial,
richly-decorated supper pavilion. Why, ladies and gentlemen, look at
the arabesque scroll-work over the door. They tell me it’s painted by
MacLise, but I can't be sure of that. Such are my instructions, but you
must judge for yourselves. What shall I say for the supper pavilion ?
Why, take it down to Brighton, and buy the Chinese Collection to put
into it, and it’s a safe fortune to anybody ? Now, gentlemen, there's to be
no reserve. . What shall I say for the supper pavilion Once, twice,
thrice—No bidding : Pass it.
“The next lot to which I have to call your attention is the ballet
theatre, with stage lamps various, two pair of wings and an odd one,
sundry flats, and green curtains, en suite. This is a very valuable lot to
any one who is looking out for anything of the kind. They tell me that
as many as seven hundred people have stood outside this ballet theatre
on the same night.”
A voice. “Where's the audience part 1"
“The audience part—JM, is there any audience part to the Ballet
Theatre (Whispers to the Clerk). I find the theatre is complete,
except the accommodation for the audience. There’ll be time enough
for that when, the audience comes. Recollect, gentlemen, we don’t
warrant any of the lots to be perfect. The conditions of sale state
expressly, all errors of description at the risk of the purchaser. What
shall I say for the ballet theatre : Does nobody bid for the ballet
theatre : Pass the ballet theatre.
“Lot. 3, ladies and gentlemen, is a gigantic wire-framework of the late
MR. SIMPson; two punch-bowls, and six dozen ginger-beer bottles. What
shall I say for this very useful lot 1"
A voice. “What’s the use of the wire-framework of MR. SIMPson 1"
“We don't find uses for all the lots we sell. If you buy the lot, you can
do what you like with it. Now, ladies and gentlemen, what shall I say
for the figure, the bowls, and the bottles A gigantic portrait, in frame, of
the late MR. SIMPson. Why, look at the bowls; you would not match
them at the potteries under a crown a piece | Here, JIM, hand round
the ginger-beer bottles, they'll bear inspection. I call this the most
useful lot in the catalogue. Worth anything to a young couple just going
into housekeeping. Will nobody make a beginning Say anything.
Will anybody offer me a ten-pound note for them, just to set the sale
a-going. Shall I say five pounds to begin with. Four—three–two—one
—half-a-sovereign—a crown—half-a-crown. Pray, ladies and gentlemen,
give me a bidding of some kind. I shall be obliged to pass this service-
able lot. Did you say a shilling, sir? No! Well then, pass the lot.
“Now we come to the really attractive part of the sale. Now, ladies and
gentlemen, I shall get your biddings. -

You'll recollect, ladies and gentlemen, when they are once lighted they
require no snuffing. What shall I say—per lamp Will any lady or
gentleman give me a penny ? The five million Waterloo Extras at-

“You can count them, sir, if you please. We can’t answer for the
number. Our porters are as careful as they can be in counting, but that

your bidding t”
A voice. “I didn’t bid.”
“Didn't you ! I beg your pardon, sir. I thought you did.

At this point of the sale a severe shower of rain having come on, our
reporter left, hearing, as he got outside the gardens, the voice of the
auctioneer exclaiming with vehemence—“Does nobody bid for the
hermit Pass the hermit.”

I ask you
statues of Great Men.
We find from a report in a French paper that during the removal of a
statue of the Duke of ORLEANs, old women whom he had befriended
rushed upon it and covered it with stars, decorations, immortelles, and
other complimentary ornaments. It is not perhaps generally known
that when Punch's splendid full-length of himself was removed from his
late to his present office, the porter who carried it was literally smothered
in the bouquets that were thrown over it ; and a poor old parishioner of
St. Stephen's Walbrook, a venerable female rate-payer, could not be per-
suaded to tear herself away from it.
“ GIVE ME A Shill, ING.”
MR. O'Connell said, at the late Galway demonstration, “I want every
man's shilling, and I will tell you why, because there's a hand and a
heart behind every shilling.” But why stop at a shilling At that rate,
it is only sixpence for the hand, and sixpence for the heart; and there's
nothing left for the head. But MR. O'Connell knows too well it is only by
keeping an Irishman's head in ignorance of what his hand and heart are
led to do, that, when he sends round the hat, he can make sure of his shilling.

YE pathrons of janius, MINERVA, and VANIUs,

Descind from your station and make observation
Of the PRInce's Pavilion in sweet Pimlico.
This garden by jakurs is forty poor acres,
(The garner he tould me, and sure ought to know ;)
And yet greatly bigger, in size and in figure,
Than the Phanix itself, seems the Park Pimlico.
O'tis there that the spoort is, when the QUEEN and the Coort is
Walking magnanimous all of a row,
Forgetful what state is among the pataties
And the pine-apple gardens of sweet Pimlico.
There in blossoms odo'rous the birds sing a chorus,
Of “God save the Queen" as they hop to and fro;
And you sit on the binches and hark to the finches,
Singing melodious in sweet Pimlico.
There shuiting their phanthasies, they pluck polyanthuses
That round in the gardens resplindently grow,
Wid roses and jessimins, and other sweet specimins,
Would charm bould LINNAYUs in sweet Pimlico.
You see when you inther and stand in the cinther,
Where the roses, and necturns, and collyflowers blow,
A hill so tremindous it tops the top-windows
Of the elegant houses of famed Pimlico.
And when you've ascinded that precipice splindid
You see on its summit a wondtherful show—
A lovely Swish building, all painting and gilding,
The famous Pavilion of sweet Pimlico.
PhInce ALBERT, of Flandthers, that Prince of Commandthers,
(On whom my best blessings hereby I bestow,)
With goold and vermilion has decked that Pavilion,
Where the QUEEN may take tay in her sweet Pimlico.

There’s lines from John MILTon the chamber all gilt on,
And pictures beneath them that’s shaped like a bow;
I was greatly astounded to think that that Roundhead
Should find an admission to famed Pimlico.
O lovely's each fresco, and most picturesque O,
And while round the chamber astonished I go ;
I think DAN MAcLise's it baits all the pieces,
Surrounding the cottage of famed Pimlico.
EAST LAKE has the chimney, (a good one to limn he),
And a vargin he paints with a sarpent below ;
While bulls, pigs, and panthers, and other enchanthers,
Is painted by LAND seeR in sweet Pimlico.
And nature smiles opposite, STANFIELD he copies it ;
O'er CLAUDE or Poussang sure 'tis he that may crow :
But SIR Ross's best faiture, is small mini-áture—
He shouldn't paint frescoes in famed Pimlico.
There's LEsl1E and Uwins has rather small doings;
There’s Dice, as brave masther as England can show ;
And the flowers and the sthrawberries, sure he no dauber is,
That painted the pannels of famed Pimlicol
In the pictures from WALTHER Scott, never a fault there's got,
Sure the marble's as natural as thrue Scaglio ;
And the Chamber Pompayen is sweet to take tay in,
And ait butther'd muffins in sweet Pimlico.
There’s landscapes by GRUNER, both solar and lunar,
Them two little Doy LEs, too, deserve a bravo;
Wid de piece by young TownsenD (for janius abounds in 't;)
And that’s why he's shuited to paint Pimlico.
That picture of SEveRN’s is worthy of rever’nce,
But some I won't mintion is rather so so;

PUNCH*S GUIDE TO SERVANTS.
THE LADY’S-MAID.
Ladies'-MAIDs are the rarest articles of female domestic service, and
being in the nature of luxuries, are the best paid. They are to cooks
and housemaids what the pine-apple is to the pomme de terre, and for this
pine-like superiority of station many are doomed to pine in vain. . The
statistics of female service give us a million maids as the grand total, and
deducting three-eighths for servants-of-all-work, two-eighths for cooks,
three-sixteenths for housemaids, and one-eighth for nurses, we have a
surplus of one-sixteenth for ladies'-maids, which will be about a fair
average.
sºut, belonging to this superior class should be able to read and
write. . It is good practice in the former accomplishment to read all the
notes sent to your mistress, and the little motto wafers, now in use, seem
invented to facilitate this arrangement, for they never adhere to the
envelope.
: will probably have the charge of your mistress's apartments.
Never suffer anything to lie about, and, therefore, you should pocket any
trifle that is left carelessly out of its place. I do not mean to say you
should become a thief, for, if found out, you would lose your place and
your character, but you may take care of a thing till it is missed, and
when it is wanted, it will of course be asked for. It is then time
enough for you to find it in some hole or corner, into which it has of
course got by accident. Your lady's dressing-box will be under your
care. See that the scent-bottles are always well supplied, which you can
only ascertain by taking a little out of them for your own use very
frequently.
ou should endeavour at all times to save your
mistress trouble by acting for her as much as you
can ; and in order to do this effectually, you should
dress as much like her as possible. Order about
other servants just as she would herself, and talk to
tradespeople exactly as if they were being spoken to
by your mistress, of whom you are the representative.
Of course the closer the representation you give of
her, the more exact are you in the performance of
your duty.
Some ladies'-maids are expected to mend their ladies' clothes; but no
lady, that is a lady, ought to wear any clothes that have been mended.
You should try and persuade her to be of the same opinion, by which
you will not only save yourself the trouble of mending, but you will
come in for many things much sooner than you could otherwise hope to
do. The author of the proverb, that “a stitch in time saves nine,” no
doubt thought himself very clever; but if avoiding trouble is the object,
it stands to reason that though “a stitch in time saves nine,” it must be a
greater saving still never to put a stitch in anything.
If your mistress will make you work at your needle, put a novel on
your lap, so that you may read and work at the same time. If you are
asked to cut out a body, make a bungling job of it, that you may not be
asked to do the same thing again. If you cut out anybody it should be
the lady's-maid next door, with which your ambition ought to be satisfied.
Taking out marks from linen is an essential part of the duties of a
lady's-maid. Some practise themselves in this art by taking out the
initials of their mistress and substituting their own ; but this is a
dangerous experiment.
It is said in a good little work,” that “when for the first time you stand
behind your mistress's chair to brush her hair, you may feel that you are
placed in a situation of high trust." This, however, depends upon
circumstances; for if your mistress dyes her hair, it is a great mark of
her confidence to ask you to brush it. If she wears false braids, she is,
to a certain extent, in your power; for, as the poet says—
“Should she upbraid,”
you might betray her; but if she is almost bald, and wears a wig, from
the moment of your being entrusted to stand behind her chair and brush
her hair, you may do what you please with her.
If, in the story of Faustus, Margaret had worn a wig, and Mephis-
tophiles had seen her but once without it, the power of the fiend over
her would have been irresistible. º
In your position of lady's-maid, many family secrets will perhaps come
to your knowledge. Do not talk of them to your fellow-servants, which
would, in fact, be destroying your own valuable monopoly. A servant
who knows a great deal of the family affairs cannot be cheaply parted
with. You will be secure in, your place, and will therefore be in a
position to make the most of all its advantages.
The little work we have already alluded to says, that if the lady's-maid
is depressed in spirits, “she should open her mind to the friend, whoever
it may be, that got her the place.” This friend is usually the keeper of a
servants' office, who would have enough to do if she were made to bear
the infliction of all the unbosomings of all the discontented servants she
may have found situations for. This mode of easing your heart would
* “Knight's Guide to Service.” The Lady's-Maid, page 27.
involve the necessity of constantly running out, besides the expense of an
occasional omnibus.
Manners form an essential part of the qualities of a lady's-maid,
and making one's self agreeable is the best mannered thing one
can possibly accomplish. This is to be done by praise, for nothing is
more agreeable to a lady than flattery. However
sensible your mistress may be, she is sure to have
a share of female vanity; and even if she knows
herself to be ugly altogether, she will fancy she
has some redeeming feature. If she squints, praise
her complexion; if that is bad, tell her she has
beautiful eyes: if she has a dumpty figure, praise her
face; and if her countenance is as ugly as sin, tell
her that her shape is exquisite. Some people will
tell you that sensible women don't like flattery;
but this you must not believe ; for, however sen-
sible they are, they are pleased by it, particularly
when it is administered with so much art as to
seem not intended for mere compliment. Very
palpable praise is insulting to the generality of
ladies; but flattery can scarcely be too gross for
some few of them. You should study the character -
of your mistress, that you may not run the risk of sº
offending her by too much praise, or hurting her
by giving too little. Your mistress will sometimes
take a journey, and you will then have to pack
her things for her. The following directions for -
F. a lady's portmanteau may, therefore, be of use
you:—
ut the lighter dresses at the bottom, for these will not be wanted while
travelling ; and artificial flowers, wreaths, &c., may go along with them.
Insert next a layer of dress caps, and ram well down with heavy dresses,
to keep the others in their places. Throw in a sprinkling of shoes, and
then add the rest of the wardrobe; cramming in the marking-ink and the
desk at the top, where they are easily got at if they are wanted. Thrust
in scissors and hair-brushes anywhere that you can find room for them.
Get the footman to cord the box, for it will be a good romp for you, as
well as a great assistance.
By following these instructions, you will find that you have a tolerably
Snug place of it.
HEARTS, HANDS, AND SHILLINGS.
DANIEL O'Connell, the other day, addressing a mob which he had
convened at Galway, is ". to have expressed himself as follows:–
“I want every man's shilling, and I will tell you why; because there
is a heart and hand behind every shilling. I want the hearts and hands
of every man.”
We have no doubt that MR. O'Connell wants every man's shilling;
and we wish we could say as much of every other assertion that has been
made by that gentleman. In particular, we should be very glad if we
could believe the sequel to this very statement. How difficult it seems to
be to the Agitator to utter an entirely credible sentence 1 He says that
he wants every man's shilling, because there is a heart and a hand
behind the coin in question.
O'Connell is not a simpleton, whatever he is; and we are sure that it is
no nonsensical reason for which he wants every man's shillings. Every
man's shilling would come to more millions of pounds sterling than we
are in a position to reckon. A great many people besides MR. O'Connell
would be very glad of every, not to say any, man's shilling. However,
when His Unacknowledged Majesty tells us that he wants the hearts and
hands of every man, this, again, is a declaration which we can receive,
with some little allowance.
We take it that he wants the hearts and hands as represented by the
shillings. Shillings, we presume, are, according to MR. O'Connell,
counters that stand for hands and hearts. But is it absolutely necessary
that those counters should be silver ? Would not bone be less expensive
to the poor Irish :
Fair on both Sides.
How often have we heard that England ought to be grateful she has a
House of Lords? If any reason were wanting, here is one :-A Peer
said, in a debate about MR. BARRY's never-to-be-completed Houses of
Parliament, “The walls of the House of Lords will be so thick, that it
will be impossible to hear anything that takes place outside.” Now, how
grateful every Englishman will be, if this advantage should be proved to
be not all on the side of the Lords !
A CAPITAL INVESTMENT.
We print the following fact for the sake of persons, possessed of large
property, who are fond of speculating: “On Tuesday, July 29th, ºthere
was a debate in the House of Lords, and LoRD BRough AM never spoke a
single word.” We should like to have the sums of money that will be
offered in a few years for a newspaper of the above date.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SCHOOL OF BAD DESIGNS.
oR some time has it lain uneasily upon
our conscience that we have neglected
this government academy, established in
Somerset House. In this matter, we
feel that we owe a heavy debt; and
shall therefore set about discharging it
with all the accumulated interest. This
we propose to do by weekly instalments.
The School, it seems, is governed by
a Council. Now Councils are almost
invariably made according to one simple
recipe: we can put it down as easily as
MRs. RUNDELL would write off “How
to make a hasty-pudding.” For instance,
| we want a council of twenty-four. “Take
| twelve or eighteen members of Parlia-
ment ; it is not necessary that they
should know common principles; indeed,
the ignorant sort are much the better
for mixing. Throw in two or three
lords; a squeeze of nobility giving the thing a soft flavour. Then
add three or four, as the case may be, plodding, intriguing, bullying
adventurers—hungry fellows, lusting after small authority—and
you have your council. Stir well together, and serve up at a table
with green cloth.”
In a very short time the Council of Twenty-four is really a
Council of Two or Three; the remainder holding on to office as a
sort of genteel thing; or, in other words, like pikes in a pond, the
smallest are swallowed by the most voracious. At this moment it
would shock the thoughtless world could it really know the Two or
Three Anthropophagi that compose Councils and Boards, of which
the legendary number still remains two dozen or upwards. Two
dozen Why, two-and-twenty of them—quiet, unoffending souls,
whose wives ought never to have trusted them from their firesides—
have been devoured, swallowed alive, by a couple of full-blooded,
brass-browed man-eaters, who, by virtue of having reduced their
fellows to nothing, appear before the world as The Council—The
Board “I am de company,” said HANDEL, when he sat down to a
dinner—and ate it, too—provided for six. “I am the Council,” says
the unabashed SMELLFUNGus, having resolved his companions into
nincompoops. And the School of Design, at Somerset House, is
governed by a Council; nominal number twenty-four.
It was thought a hopeful day for England, when the Minister
announced the resolution to found a British School of Design. The
blithe news struck upon the nerves of the whole empire. Manchester
rejoiced ; and with prophetic eye gazed upon her thousand thousand
looms, glowing with ten thousand thousand fancies—bright and rich
as Dutchmen's tulips—the work of her own children; her well-
taught sons and daughters, their genius fostered and directed by the
state. Swart Birmingham rested upon his hammer, and smiles of
sunshine brightened his smutched brows, and in his own hearty way
he thanked the patriot statesman for the school proposed : for
thence would Birmingham gain new devices; thence would he fix
the beautiful with iron hold—VENUs lying in Vulcanic arms
And Sheffield, too, was glad. And quiet Norwich, thinking of her
crapes and stuffs, smiled like a happy Quakeress; for the School of
Design would abound with beauty, even to her. And Coventry,
smiths, glass-painters, brass-workers, carvers, &c. produced. It is in fact a mere
ºsºl, and does not improve the taste or knowledge of the operative in the
east.”
At the present time MR. PUGIN has the direction of the greatest
amount of decorative work that, in all probability, may be required
by Government for half-a-century. And who executes this work ;
Alas! MR. Pugin when he sought for artists could not pause at
Somerset-house. No : he was compelled to take steamer, and to
cross the seas. And now he returns with workmen from Louvain,
from Bruges, from Ghent; and it is to the labour of alien hands
that the English Senate House will owe its decorative beauty
Let us, however, return to our brief history of the School of
Design. “Some time after the establishment of the school,” says
MR. WILLIAMs, in the Commons, “MR. DycE was engaged as
conductor.” MR. Dyce, of course, did not succeed. That is, he
failed with the council. As the council is composed and guided—
let not the reader forget the above-named anthropophagi—it was to
be expected. MR. Dyce is a man of great ability: the very man
who ought to be in office in such an institution; and, of course, after
a time, he was the last man to be tolerated there. Whereupon he
was removed.
And now, enter MR. WILson vice MR. Dyce. It is said that MR.
WILson is a decorative gardener. Truly, it is a pity for the success
of the School of Design, that he was ever transplanted from Edin-
burgh. Pity is it, that he was not suffered to continue, north of
Tweed, his useful labours on—
“Sweet-william and sweet-marjoram, and all
The tribes of single and of double pinks.”
For, at Somerset House, it appears, he has sown little but the
whirlwind ; and however lulled the atmosphere may seem for a
time, as sure as there are thistles in Caledonia and asses to browse
on them, so surely will he reap the storm. In a very short time,
MR. Wilson was found out. As they say in the melo-drama, “His
Highness was discovered.” The students—students have a strange
quick way of jumping at the ignorance of an empirical master—saw
through Wilson as plainly as through a cabbage-net. They
denounced him, and the Council, or rather the Anthropophagi,
cashiered the fault-finders. They in turn petition, and a Committee
is moved for in the Commons “to inquire into the general manage-
ment and present state” of the School of Design. The Committee
is, of course, denied ; two or three of the Council defending the
Council. Whereupon WILson and the Anthropophagi embrace,
and sing—“Now is there peace in Heaven.”
And here, until next week, we leave them. Until next week, for
we are vowed to the work; and ere we have done, will turn the
School of Bad Designs (with all its collateral puffing) inside out,
like one of MR. WILson's gloves.

SMALL CHANGE FOR PERSONS GOING ON THE
CONTINENT.
ERsons of importance being in the habit, at this season of
º the year, of rushing to the Continent,
º we have drawn up the following rules,
after six trips up and down the Danube
º, and Rhine, to enable travellers to sup-
º port the character of Englishmen with
that degree of pride and gentlemanly
spirit for which they are noted abroad.
1. Write your name in large letters,
with date and address, wherever you go.
For this purpose, you had better carry
º with you a bottle of WARREN's
º
blacking and a large brush, and you can
then lay it on as thick as you please.
2. If you go into a cathedral when
service is going on, never mind talking,
or staring, or pointing, as much as you
like ; for it standstoreason, if the people
are really as intent on their devotions
as they pretend to be, they cannot hear,
or see you. The best way to test this,
is to walk down the aisles with your
hat on.
3. Always suspect you are being im-
posed upon. It is well known that the
s º
*
CŞ.
innumerable small foreign coins were expressly invented to puzzle
the English. To f. against giving too much, bargain for every-
thing you have, and try to beat down every item in your bill. Recol-
lect it is the notion of foreigners that every Englishman is stuffed full
of money. The sooner you disabuse them of this notion the better. ... ºº
4. Laugh at everything you do not understand, and never fail to
ridicule anything that appears strange to you.
class will affor
talent to mimic them. Their religious ceremonies you will also find to
be an endless source of amusement.
5. Never mind what damage you do, as long as you can afford to pay
for it. Your brothers and sisters will naturally expect some remem- |
brance of your tour, so do not scruple to carry off a souvenir of every
monument you visit. A saint's finger, or a collection of king's noses, if
cleverly taken from the statues, or a whole statue itself taken during the
night from its consecrated niche in some lonely street, will convince your
jºi. you have not forgotten them, besides affording you capital sport
and healthy excitement in making the collection.
6. Recollect very few people talk English on the Continent, so you
may be perfectly at your ease in abusing foreigners before their faces,
and talking any modest nonsense you like, in the presence of ladies, at a
table d'hôte. Do not care what you say about the government of any
particular state you may be visiting, and show your national spirit by
boasting, on .# possible occasion, of the superiority of England and
everything English.
7. If you go to a theatre and do not know a word of the language of
the pieces, do not hesitate to talk as loudly as you can, or to laugh
preposterously at the gibberish, which it is a marvel to you anybody can
understand.
8. If foreign states will have foolish laws about passports, it is not to
be expected that you, as a free-born Englishman, will tamely submit to
them, so always move about as independently as if you were in your own
country. If, by a stretch of despotism, you are taken up or sent back,
you have your redress by complaining to the British ambassador, or else
by sending your case to be laid before Parliament as a casus belli, to
any distinguished member of the opposition of the time being.
9. Be particular about your diet. Avoid foreign dishes; be sure that
the wines are poison; and grumble at everything you get. Recollect that
beefsteaks and bottled porter are always kept in the smallest villages for
the use of the English.
10. Swear, if you have a mind for it, at the smallest provocation; and,
if a fellow is insolent, thrash him, and, if any one interferes, thrash him
also. Recollect you can indulge in any violence you please, as long as
you have the means to pay for it.
11. Be sure to take English servants with you. They are useful in
speaking the language, settling the bills, and taking you to see the most
remarkable sights of the country. Besides, they are so good-tempered,
and so pleased with everything, the eating and drinking especially, that
it is proverbial an English John and lady's-maid add materially to the
comfort of a continental trip. -
12. Buy something at every place you stop at. The foreign articles
are not only so much cheaper and better than any you can get in Eng-
land, but there is also the pleasure of looking at them, and the pride of
displaying them before other people, every time your boxes are examined
at a custom-house. If you are asked to pay anything extra for them,
The habits of the lower |
d: abundant entertainment, if you have the proper ||
on the ground of duty, sooner allow every article to be confiscated, than
submit to the imposition. -
13. Take all your wardrobe with you. Extra luggage is never charged
for on the continent, and it would be very foolish to miss an important
ceremony, or a royal invitation, for the want of a proper gown, coat,
bonnet, cocked hat, pelisse, or regimentals. You can always avoid the
nuisance of having your boxes examined, by asking to see the officer on
duty, and slipping a bank-note of the country (price 3s.) into his hand.
14. Be sure to cultivate your moustachios the very day you start for
the continent, and allow your hair to grow down your back. Buy a
dialogue-book, and, if you study it attentively all the way up the Rhine,
and at all the places you visit, you will be able, by the time you reach
London, to ask, “Which is the nearest way to Cologne : ” in no less than
eight different languages.
Attend most scrupulously to the above golden rules, and you will never
find any difficulty in getting on with the small change with which we have
provided you for your trip, Disburse it liberally wherever you go, and
you will certainly succeed in making the name of an Englishman
respected and beloved all over the continent, and will impress foreign-
ers with the belief that England is without a doubt—what you must
always be boasting she is—the most civilised country in the world.

THE SPECULATION MANIA.
AMONG the new Companies to which the present mania for speculation
has given rise, the following seems promising, on account of its extreme
novelty. That the merits of the concern may be well understood, we
print, in extenso, the
P R O S P E C T US
OF THE GRAND PIC-nic Junction AND GREAT ALIMENTARY CANAL COMPANY.
The capital will consist of two hundred thousand spoons, and the Com-
pany has been already
Provisionally Registered.
The object of this vast national undertaking is to develope the resources
of pic-nics to a greater extent than has ever yet been attempted. The
Directors have it in contemplation to purchase the Petersham Meadows,
and lay down a line of plates from one end to the other with a cold collation
at each of the grand termini, and sandwiches at all the intermediate stations.
It has been calculated that the Company will thus secure all the pic-nic
traffic from the Great Western road; and the addition of a branch to
Hampton Court will greatly augment the probable profits of the share-
holders. It is intended subsequently to open a communication between
Sandwich and Ham Common, from which a large revenue may be looked
for. The Directors have ascertained that five hundred fillets of veal and
an equal number of rounds of beef are annually consumed in pic-nics;
and having secured the services of a celebrated engineer, of Vauxhall-
slice celebrity, they calculate that the cuttings may be conducted on the
most economical principles. The provisional committee are daily en-
gaged in trying experiments at the board on the best means of supplying
the alimentary canal, and the deposits paid by shareholders will be devoted
to the preliminary expenses which are being now incurred for the purpose
alluded to.
Prospectuses and further particulars may be had at the Company's
temporary offices on the Eel Pie Island; and in the mean time it is hoped
that the announcement of
Duke HUMPhRey
as Chairman, will inspire the public with confidence in the solidity of the
undertaking.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Punch had a little sporting a few days ago in the celebrated Fields
of Lincoln's Inn. He took with him a couple of quick-scented legal
pointers, and went into the well-known Chancery preserves for a
day's shooting. His object was merely to get rid of a number
of strange birds that had been in the habit of pilfering his fruit
with the utmost effrontery. The pointers having hit upon the
exact point where the game was exposed, Punch fired two shots, both
of which took immediate effect, and he ordered the game to be hung
up against a column as a warning to future depredators.
Some light will be thrown on the above by the following Law

It is reported expressly by Punch's own reporter, who is putting
by all the money he makes by reporting, to pay his fees on taking

CAMPBELL, MR. HoRAce Twiss, and a few others who have similarly
degraded themselves, may have incurred by reporting for the public
journals. If he should be dismissed from his position on the 'press
for incompetence, he will be happy to fraternise at once with those
sticklers for the independence and dignity of the bar, who think
reporting infra dig, because they can't get it to do, or who, when they
do get it to do, do not know how to do it.
As Punch's own reporter is not in either of these categories at
present, he proceeds with his report of the

. It seems, from the Debate on the Supplies, that Kings, and Emperors,
and Royal Princes, when they come to this country, do not pay their own
travelling expenses. John BULL is called upon to pay for turnpikes,
! stokers, equerries, boots, glasses of brandy-and-water;-in fact, every-
thing. . Now, this is too bad! Not only does an autocrat come to Eng-
land when he is not wanted, but we are actually forced to pay for the
very ship that brings him to us. It is just as if a “sponge” were to
dine with you on a Sunday—eat and drink as much as he liked—stop all
night—and then ask you to pay for his omnibus home, and for the cab
that brought him to your door . We vote that if the EMPERoR of Russia
comes to England again, he be allowed, like a commercial traveller, so
much a day for travelling expenses; and if he has a sandwich and a glass
of ale beyond that, he must get his Chancellor of the Exchequer to pa
for it. If the Emperor does not like this arrangement, we are glad to tell
him, he has his remedy—he needn't come at all.

whistled at the wing.
aw one wilo 11-8
ANEcdotes of Actors are the cacoethes at present with
almost all the Magazines, we have, at great expense,
collected the following from a stage-doorkeeper, who,
having retired from the portico of public life, has given
us permission to state, he received them from the
copyist of the Grecian Saloon, to whom they had been
told in confidence by a bill-of-the-play woman of the last
century, who had them direct from the above gentle-
man (a deceased call-boy, candle-snuffer, and scene-
shifter,) during his memorable engagement at the
Globe Theatre. We can assure our readers that not
one of them has ever been published before.
GARRick used to drink nothing, when he was acting,
but water-gruel. His Romeo averaged four pints; but
for the curse in King Lear, I have known him to take
as many as three quarts in one evening. When he
performed the “Walking Gentleman,” however, he
preferred a glass of ginger-beer with the white of an
egg in it.
Dicky Stone was the first to dress the “fools” in their
present costume. Before his time, the fools were always
dressed like courtiers; but the Earl of Essex having
complained, Elizabeth got her “faithful Commons” to
pass a law for the alteration.
An actor of the name of SMITH had a celebrated dog,
called “Towser.” They performed once in a piece
entitled, The Dog of Deal, or Dover—I forget which—
in which the dog had to spring at SMITH's throat,
SMITH being a murderer. HARRY Sawyer, however,
was in a private box the first night; and, just as the
dog was making the fatal spring, he threw on the stage
a large piece of cat's-meat : the consequence was,
Towser rushed immediately to the tempting morsel,
and nothing would induce him to leave it to revenge
his master's murder. An apology was made for the
dog, but all to no purpose; the piece was unequivocally
condemned.
GRIMALDI was anything but funny off the stage. I
have seen him at the wing so affected at George Barn-
well, that he has been obliged frequently to chalk his
cheeks three times in the same evening, on account of
the tears washing all the paint off. His “Here we
are " never failed to make George The THIRD laugh.
The merry monarch would say—“Yes; here we are
Capital —Yes: here we are Ha! hal”—and he would go on so
—very true !—we are here !
for five minutes, till something else was said—“Somebody coming !” perhaps, which he would
repeat in the same facetious way, loud enough for the whole house to hear him.
DANDY SMITH used to wear shirt-collars made out of letter-paper. LoRD BYRon was one night
behind the scenes asking for an order, but nobody had any paper on which to write one. Smith
immediately pulled out, with great presence of mind, one side of his collar; and, filling it up, presented
; i. Hond ByRon, saying, “Allow me, my lord, to invest you with the Collar of the O. P.
ruler.
HARRY SIMPson never would take any medicine; and his medical man was often obliged to
resort to some stratagem to impose a dose upon him. There is a piece,—I do not recollect the
name, -in which the hero is sentenced in prison to drink a cup of poison. HARRY SIMPson was
playing this character one night, and had given directions to have it filled with port wine; but what
was his horror, when he came to drink it, to find it contained a dose of senna He could not throw
it away, as he had to hold the goblet upside down, to show his persecutors he had drained every
drop of it. SIMPson drank the medicine with the slowness of a poisoned martyr; but he never

Astley was the first to originate jokes by the Clown in the ring. The celebrated conundrum of
“When is a door not a door?” made its début under his management; and was so popular, that
places for the boxes were sold like stock on the Royal Exchange, and fetched a higher premium
than any of the funds. A private box for
the Amphitheatre was considered at that
time the most valuable wedding-present in
a lady's trousseau.
BETTER ron had the gift of a very beautiful
whistle. He would take a piece of wood, and
whistle upon it with such intense feeling and
melody, that a whole theatre has imagined he
was playing upon the flute. He has often
played in this way in the orchestra when the
flute has been suddenly indisposed. When
he was a strolling player, he has lived for
days upon his whistle, paying his expenses,
with nothing else, from town to town. The
recollection of his shake is still cherished in
many of our northern counties.
Mrs. Hubbard (the original “Old Maid”
in Have a Cap and Set a Cap) was a very
great favourite in pathetic parts; as she was
known to cry more naturally than anybody
else. The secret of this was never known
till her death, when there was found a be-
quest in her will of ten pounds, to be divided
in onions every Christmas-Day amongst poor
undertakers out of prison.
An elephant was never introduced on the
English stage till the production of Blue
Beard. This is a positive fact; for Fawcett
made his first appearance, I recollect, in one
of its hind legs. He was so nervous at the
time, that in going over one of the traps it
gave way, and Fawcett and his companion
leg were precipitated through it. The result
was that Blue Beard and his black attendant
were brought to the ground; and the two
front legs of the elephant were seen lifted
up in the air kicking away most violently,
whilst the two hind legs, with Fawcett in
one of them, were kicking no less violently
under the stage. The curtain was obliged to
be dropped before Fawcett, or the elephant,
could resume his natural footing. He after-
wards attempted to put down elephants when
he was stage-manager, but they were always
too strong for him.
MRs. BILLINgton had ninety wigs. They
were of all colours, and of all ages. She was
offered as much as two thousand pounds for
them by TALMA, who wanted to present them
to NApoleon ; but she refused the offer, as
she was determined they should not go out of
the country. She kept her word; for she
bequeathed them to the British Museum,
where they may still be seen on referring to
the head of “Fossils.”
QUIN was a very great gourmand. He
would have his mustard from Durham ; and
his salt was sent to him regularly from
Epsom. A box, hermetically sealed, was left
at the stage-door for him every morning
from Richmond, full of Maids of Honour;
and he never travelled without carrying be-
hind his carriage a tank of sea-water, made
in the shape of a trunk, filled with shrimps
or periwinkles. When he was ill, he would
touch nothing but a Pope's-eye boiled in
ketchup.
I recollect CHARLEs the Second coming
incog. to the King's Theatre, to see NELL
Gwynne act Policotia in Not such a Fool
as He Looks. Unfortunately, in those days,
there was no Free List; and the King had
not sufficient money about him to pay for a
seat in the gallery, much less in the boxes.
The consequence was, he was obliged to send
Buckingham to a pawnbroker's with his hat
and cloak; and, with the money that was
advanced upon them, he paid for his own
and his friend's admission. Nobody would
have known anything about this, only a
Welch gentleman, happening to hiss NELL
when she was dancing, between the acts, the
Highland Fling, CHARLEs picked a quarrel
with him; and, in the heat of passion, struck
him. Cards were instantly exchanged; but

circumstance in his Memoirs, under Feb. 31, 1666.
OUR
NATION AI, D EF EN C E S.
It is extremely gratifying to have had the assurance of
Ministers, that in the event of war requiring the whole of our
troops, England has still got the Chelsea pensioners to fall
back upon...The wooden walls of Old England are safe while
she has still her wooden legs to stand upon.
We understand that a review of the Chelsea pensioners
will shortly take place, as a preliminary to bringing the
yeterans into active service. There may be some difficulty
in obeying the words of command, for the ordinary operation
of shouldering arms will be somewhat of a puzzle to those
who have no arms to shoulder. “Recover arms” will be an
evolution that many would be delighted to perform if it were
practicable, and “Stand at ease” will be a suggestion that
those who have lost their legs may find some difficulty in
complying with.
Whether the Chelsea corps is to form a portion of HER
MAJESTY's Foot we have not heard, but the regiment of “No
#: ” would perhaps be a more appropriate title to most of
eIII.
“Quick march” will, we understand, not be insisted upon
as part of the exercise to be performed by the veterans, who
will be divided into rank and file, some of whom will rank
as old files, according to seniority.
The guns dealt out to those who have no legs will be con-
structed on a principle that must prevent them from kicking,
for it is felt to be hard on the old legless boys to have kicking
guns given them, when it is out of their power to kick in
return.
THE DUKE AND THE RAT CATCHER.
THE DUKE of BucKINGHAM has a fine eye for a happy peasantry.
On a Royal visit to Stowe, his Grace can group a thousand tillers of
the soil—in snowy smock-frocks, washed expressly for the occasion
—with the taste of a ballet-master. The Duke is the farmer's
friend; and therefore, descending a little in his benevolence, he is
the friend of the labourer. Nevertheless, his Grace is a greater
friend to leverets, though they shall be no bigger than kittens. In
the East there are asylums and hospitals for reptiles; and the man
who could with meekest serenity contemplate the wants of his fellow
biped, would feel the tenderest pity for a cock-roach or a lizard.
And in this spirit de some of our gentlemen of England—“Merry
England,” as sometimes, with a knowing look and tongues in their
cheeks, they call it—preserve their game. Fine, imprison, grind to
the dust the peasant—but preserve the game ! Heap hot coals upon
the grey head of the labourer—but preserve the game ! Be deaf to the
goodly reputation of forty years, and punish the dog in the pauper
master (for they are one and the same thing) but—preserve the game 1
The DUKE of BucKINGHAM (represented by one of his game-
keepers,) appeared a few days since at the Buckingham Petty
Sessions against a “venerable-looking man,” although a rat-catcher,
named WILLIAM WHITE. Fearful odds ! “The judges were
ranged—a terrible show;” for they were three preachers of the word
of God, “the REv. MEssms. Eyne, ANDREws, and BAYNEs.” The
offender, WHITE, had caught rats for forty years; and in that time
had never been cited before a magistrate. He had a wife and five
children to support; and (rat-catching was not the best of trades,
the Reverend Magistrates themselves might allow that) at times, it
was a hard matter with him to get his crust in an honest way. He
was crossing the public road, followed by three dogs. One of them
went into a ditch, and brought out and killed “a leveret as big as a
kitten.” Whereupon, the officer of the Duke of BuckINGHAM—
the labourer's friend—cited the dog's master before the Bench I
And then did these reverend men take counsel one with another;
and sympathising with the wrongs of the coronetted owner of the
leveret as big as a kitten, they ordered WILLIAM WHITE to “pay
18s., and in default fourteen days' imprisonment.”
WILLIAM WHITE handed in a written testimonial of good cha-
racter, signed by many men of good report: and the Reverend
Magistrates—what could they do?—looked at the document, and
still the sentence was—“18s., or fourteen days' imprisonment.” Not a
shilling—not a day was abated; but mercy was not wholly banished
from the court: time was given to the rat-catcher to earn the money.
Thus, WILLIAM WHITE–his family, to be sure, will be pinched a
little for bread the while—may be enabled to discover how many
rats make the value of one “leveret as big as a kitten.” He may
also learn the true value of character; may feel how worthless is the
reputation of forty years’ honest toil, when his dog kills a “leveret
as big as a kitten.” And thus at beer-houses, by the way-side, and
at the cottage-hearth, will the tale of the naughty WILLIAM White
go round; and—it is natural to suppose it—a universal love for the
DUKE of BuckINGHAM in the individual, and reverence for aris-
tocracy in the abstract, will sink into the hearts of the story-tellers.
And thus will the reputation of the DUKE of BuckINGHAM descend.
For though he may not mark his name in his country's councils—
though, with the exception of the £50 clause, he may never be known
as a legislator—still his name may travel from generation to gene-
ration of rustics, written in the blood of “leverets as big as kittens.”
Yet is not all our sympathy for WILLIAM WHITE. No ; we feel
a touch of compassion for his reverend judges. Apostolical as they
must be, we can imagine their moral struggles, the acuteness of
their suffering, when called upon to levy a crushing fine upon a
venerable old man who has lived a life of honesty and toil, for that
his dog has killed “a leveret as big as a kitten.” Sure we are, that
with their peculiar caste of thought, they must now and then ask
themselves whether leverets, any more than field-mice, were sent
upon the earth to be ticketted as the sacred property of any one
owner. It is unfortunate that when a game-law sentence of peculiar
cruelty is to be pronounced, a clergyman is generally on the bench
to utter it. To be sure, this may give more solemnity to the sacri-
fice; as in the olden day the victim was always sacrificed by a priest.
CHANGE of DIET.-We see MR. Forbes MACKENziE was amongst the
number of guests at the ministerial white-bait, dinner. We hope the
honourable member was provided with something better than his own
words to eat ; for really nothing else seems to have passed MR. Mack-
Enzie's lips since he has joined the mess of ministers.
PUBLIC SAFETY.—Accidents are becoming so plentiful on the railways
that we seriously propose that an Act of Parliament should be passed next
session, making it penal for any railway to start without one or more
directors in each train. When their own lives are in jeopardy, we are sure
the railway autocrats will see the necessity of the greatest caution being
used by every one employed on the line, to guard the public against injury.

3}untb's Court Cirtular.
The KING of the NETHERLANDs having expressed a desire to see les
chevreuils de la Reine, was conducted to the royal nursery, where he
had an audience of the PRINCE of Wales. It was explained to His
Majesty that the royal infant was le lièvre à la couronne (the heir to the
crown). His Royal Highness, or rather His Royal Diminutiveness,
expressed himself much gratified at the interview, and produced several
of his toys for the inspection of His Dutch Majesty. Among others
were a set of ring-taws, when the King of the NETHERLANDs inquired
if they were the celebrated Elgin Marbles he had heard so much said
about. The PRINCE having requested his illustrious visitor to try his
hand at the game, the KING of the NETHERLANDs knuckled down, and
having taken one or two shots, retired.

MORTALITY OF LONDON TURNPIKES,
The Queen's Elm Turnpike, on the Fulham Road, is now no more. It
expired on Tuesday, the 5th instant, at twelve o'clock at night. Its
last moments were embittered by the low ribaldry of several unfeeling
cabmen and omnibus conductors, who took a savage pleasure in taunting
the poor turnpike on its declining powers, and actually danced round its
inanimate frame. Its funeral took place on Wednesday, when its remains
were conveyed in a morning cart to the tomb of all the Capulets, where
several of the London turnpikes have been buried before. The turnpike-
man acted as chief mourner, and seemed to be terribly put out, owing to
the sudden loss!of the deceased, whom he had known thoroughly from the
moment of his berth.

P U N C H 'S VIS IT
TO THE SURREY ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.
NDERSTANDING that there was
to be a Sylvan Féte at
these gardens, we were
seized with a sudden love
of the pastoral, and
jumped on to the top of
a Kennington omnibus.
We had already been
attracted by sundry hand-
- - bills promising a truly
- == rustic treat, and crammed
.. - full of that bad spelling
which appears to have been the chief characteristic of “Merrie England,
in ye Oldenne Tyme.”
The merriment of our forefathers seems to have consisted a great deal
in the quaintness of their orthography, and in sundry ryght stupidde
freakes of ye grosseste humbugge, of which the Sylvan Féis at the Surrey
Zoological Gardens was intended to furnish a specimen. Having ex.
changed grins of recognition with the hyena, and nodded familiarly to our
old friend the polar bear, we made for the part of the gardens where the
Rustic Games were being proceeded with, and our attention was first
attracted by a decayed old corporal, bent double with age, followed by a
venerable drummer and a superannuated fife, one of whom was playing
“In the merry month of May,” while the other was vacillating between
“The Dashing White Sergeant” and “The Soldier's Tear.” On refer-
ing to the bills, we found this to be “a real recruiting party from the
Tower.”, Nobody, however, seemed disposed to “follow the drum,” and
indeed the drum was so eccentric in its variations from one tune to
another, that to follow him would have been exceedingly difficult.
The recruiting party having disappeared among the trees, was seen to
be quietly recruiting its own strength with a pot of half-and-half at the
back of the elephant ground. We did not observe that they enlisted any-
thing but the sympathies of all who saw them.
Agingling of bells announced the commencement of the peculiarly
English sport of the maypole, with its morris-dancers. we rushed to the
spot with truly British eagerness, desirous of studying
the sports and pastimes of our forefathers and fore.
mothers. Our disappointment at seeing the villagers
was more poignant and agonising than can be possibly
conceived. Conynon was an evident supernumerary
from Astley's, who, we will be bound, never had a
shepherd's pipe in his mouth, though a pipe of another
description was probably no stranger to his lips. The
maypole was richly bedizened with Mayflowers. There
was the calico pink made of pink calico, and the roses
of the lawn in the shape of lawn roses. They may talk
as they will about the powers of Nature, but Nature
could never make such artificial flowers as those with
which the maypole and the maidens were decorated.
The peculiarly English sport at length commenced by the lads and
lasses, one of whom looked ancient enough to be the original old lass of
Richmond Hill, who began to twirl themselves round and round the may-
pole to the sound of the pipe and tabor. The tabor was awfully out of
ºne, and it several times completely put the other musician's pipe out.
The “peculiarly English sport” went off rather heavily, in spite of the
efforts of an individual in a white waistcoat and long hair, who super-
intended the dance, and who, it was whispered, was the celebrated C.
*ºnebody or other from the Royal Pavilion; but whether Brighton or
Whitechapel we could not exactly discover.
The next feature of the Sylvan Fête was the display of the noble science
of archery, by the members of the Toxopholite Club in their forest
- costume. This forest costume was of rather
a miscellaneous character; for though one
Toxopholite wore on his head a ninepenny
Glengary, with a green tunic, such as KEELEY
used to wear in the Beulah Spa, and a boy's
black leather belt, with pantaloons that
seemed to have walked, boots and all, out of
DoudNEy's window—though one Toxopholite
wore all this, the forest costume of the rest
included only the ordinary costume. There
was the wrapper fresh from the bonny banks
of Tweed, and we thought we recognised one
of the registered paletots; but there seemed to be nothing peculiarly
adapted for forest wear about the dress of the mass of the Toxopholites.
One of the merrie archers had a sandwich-box slung round him by a
silken cord, and another sported a pair of moustachios, which he probably
.. as his forest costume, which he takes off while engaged at the
desk, driving the quill instead of letting fly the feathered arrow. The
display of archery was, however, quite enough to justify the promise that
there should be a representation of Merrie England; for the efforts of the
convnox.
Toxopholites kept an audience of six thousand'souls in one scream of
laughter from the beginning to the end of the exhibition.
If FRIAR Tuck and his merrie men made such a mull of it in Sherwood
Forest, we do not wonder at their having contributed to the mirthfulness
of Old England. The only thing the Toxopholites never
hit was the target. They sent their arrows over it, under
it, and on all sides of it, but never into it, amid the shouts
of the multitude. Friendly suggestions at length pro-
ceeded from the spectators, advising some unfortunate
Toxopholite to “shut his eyes and try his luck that
way.” The Toxopholites at last got very cross, and
kept making all sorts of querulous excuses for not
hitting the target, saying it was because the crowd pressed upon them,
and putting forth other frivolous pretexts.
Among the other rustic attractions, “the manly and athletic game of
quarter-staff” was advertised; but we saw nothing of it. The police, we
are told, are very good hands at the manly practice, and use their quarter-
staffs in a row with the most effective energy.
The next Sylvan excitement was a match at jumping in sacks; and as
we could only see the heads of the competitors, we cannot give the colours
of the runners, whom we can only describe by what we
saw of them. We shall therefore take hold of their hair,
as the best method of distinguishing them. When the
word was given to start, grey went away at a brisk hop,
followed closely by carrots. Bald then made all the
jumping, and carrots was close up to him, when scratch-
wig got into the first rank, and, knocking up against
curly chesnut, both of them fell heavily. The match
now lay between grey, bald, and carrots, and 8 to 7:
were freely taken on grey, while the backers of bald were
offering 0 to XX; but no one seemed disposed to specu-
late. At length grey got his foot twisted in the folds of
the sack and tumbled, when bald, hopping past at a slap-
ping pace, struck his ancle against grey’s heel, and rolled
over him. Carrots now had it all his own way, and did
the last six yards playfully, amid the applause of the assembled multitude.
we have now noticed all the principal features of this Sylvan Féte, with
the exception of some “real gipsies," who were so exceedingly eccentric
that we were gladſto make the best of our way out of their encampment.
After having supported the awful ennui of the merrie makynge in the
oldenne style, we repaired to the Refreshment Room,
which is conducted on teatotal principles – tea and
coffee only being obtainable. We however detected
in a glass jar the insidious brandy lurking under the
harmless cherry, for there was an enormous jorum of
cherry-brandy on the counter of the Refreshment
Room.
* By the way, as we were going out of the Refresh-
ment Room, we were stopped at a bar till we had pro-
duced certain bits of card with the word “paid” upon
them, which had been given to us when settling for
our frugal meal of juvenile coffee and boys' bread and
butter. Can it be that the proprietors fear their visitors
may realise the old fable of two teas making their
escape over the palings! . The arrangement, whatever
may be the cause of it, is not very complimentary to
the guests who honour the gardens with a visit.
Though our remarks on the Sylvan Féte have not been particularly
flattering, we must do justice to the general attractions of the Surrey
Zoological Gardens. Auld Reekie, with its pasteboard pinnacles and
canvas chimney pots, is, indeed, a glorious sight, while the pyrotechnic
display, including the rising of BRITANNIA from a lake, with VicroR1A and
ALBERT under each arm, must be regarded as one of those singular
triumphs of fiction over fact, which the pyrotechnic artist is famous for.

PUNCH'S JUSTICE.
THERE is a venerable saying, that a certain old gentleman ought to
receive what is fairly due to him ; and we therefore hasten to do justice
to the King of PRussia, by acknowledging that we fell into an error when
accusing him of having made a composer bow before his portrait, the
King of BAvARIA being the delinquent in the case alluded to. The
German despots are all, however, so much alike, that it is sometimes
difficult to distinguish them. It is so unusual for Punch to make a
mistake of this kind, that we have received exactly fourteen hundred
and seventy-eight letters on the subject; the writers of which request
the insertion of their epistles.
As this would involve the necessity for a series of monster supplements
and an occasional extra number, with an appendix at the end of the year,
we must decline printing the correspondence, but we have much pleasure
in making the amende to the King of PRussia, whose visit to our office,
two or three years ago, established an intimacy between ourselves and
him, which his own despotic conduct to his subjects has unhappily
interrupted.

makes more noise about 'em when you want 'em.
“I only hope they’ve been to the wine-cellar: then you may know
what my feelings are. That poor cat, too—What? You hate cats 2
Yes, poor thing ! because she’s my favourite—that’s it. If that
cat could only speak—What? It isn't necessary 2 I don’t know what
you mean, MR. CAUDLE: but if that cat could only speak, she'd tell
me how she's been cheated. Poor thing ! I know where the
money’s gone to that I left for her milk—I know. Why what have
you got there, MR. CAUDLE A book? What I If you ain't allowed
to sleep, you’ll read? Well, now it is come to something ! If that
isn't insulting a wife to bring a book to bed, I don't know what wed-
lock is. But you shan’t read, CAUDLE ; no, you shan’t ; not while
I’ve strength to get up and put out a candle.
“And that’s like your feelings You can think a great deal of
trumpery books; yes, you can't think too much of the stuff that's put
into print ; but for what’s real and true about you, why you’ve the
heart of a stone. I should like to know what that book's about :
What? Milton's Paradise Lost 2 I thought some rubbish of the sort
—something to insult me. A nice book, I think, to read in bed; and
a very respectable person he was who wrote it. What do I know of
him 2 Much more than you think. A very pretty fellow, indeed,
with his six wives. What? He hadn't six—he'd only three ? That's
nothing to do with it; but of course you'll take his part. Poor
women A nice time they had with him, I dare say ! And I’ve no
doubt, MR. CAUDLE, you’d like to follow MR. MILtoN's example:
else you wouldn't read the stuff he wrote. But you don't use me as
he treated the poor souls who married him. Poets, indeed I’d
make a law against any of 'em having wives, except upon paper; for
goodness help the dear creatures tied to them 1 Like innocent moths
lured by a candle ! Talking of candles, you don't know that the
lamp in the passage is split to bits I say you don't—do you hear
me, MR. CAUDLE i Won't you answer? Do you know where you
are : What In the Garden of Eden 2 Are you? Then you’ve no
business there at this time of night.”
“And saying this,” writes CAUDLE, “she scrambled from the bed,
and put out the light.”
WESTMINSTER BRIDGE.
This unhappy old structure, which has long ago been condemned, on
being tried by its Piers, has been the subject of a conversation in the
Commons. It seems that several engineers and two or three commis-
sioners have sat upon it, and “the mercy is,” as the old women say, that
the ricketty concern did not give way with them... We never see a loaded
omnibus going over it without wondering whether it will get safe to the
other side, and we are quite certain that a Life Insurance Office at the
foot of the Bridge at either end, would be a very profitable speculation.
Everything has been tried with this dreary pile, but nothing seems to
answer. It has been made to lower its proud head to the extent of
several feet, but still it is almost as bad as climbing up a rock and
descending a precipice, to go on to the bridge at one end and off at
the other.
The first experiment was to scoop a lot of our mother earth out of the
centre of the bridge, and the foot passengers are consequently walking on
the heights, while the vehicles are placed in a valley “down down below;”
but nothing answers the purpose. The crazy old concern is past mending,
and the only remedy is that proposed in the House of Commons the other
night, namely, to pull it all down and build a new one.

HEARTLESS TREATMENT OF ALDERMAN MOON |
SoME monster or monsters in the human shape have sported with
the feelings of ALDERMAN Moon—Punch's own Moon ; cruelly
tortured them as naughty boys sport with tender butterflies. The
miscreants—for the honour of our national character we trust they
are not Englishmen—sent letters in Moon's name to the electors of
the ward who had chosen him for their Aldermanic luminary: letters
inviting them to a solemn festival in the halls of Threadneedle
Street. A copy of one of these wicked epistles has been forwarded
to us. We envy not, as the Art Union would sweetly observe, the
“head-hand-and-heart” of the forlorn creature that could so sport
with the feelings of an Alderman—so cruelly tantalize the abdominal
yearnings of the immaculate electors of a wardmote. We subjoin the
aforesaid copy:-
“Mr. ALDERMAN Moon presents his compliments, and would feel him-
self tremendously honoured by the company of MR. — to dinner. MR.
ALDERMAN Moon feels that he has too long delayed what must be a most
delightful réunion 1 For how delicious to reciprocate with sparkling wine
the #. feelings of the electors and the elected 1
“MR. ALDERMAN Moon begs leave to add that his dessert will be
honoured with several gorgeous pine-apples, luscious gifts from the heads
of nobility.
“N.B.-Doctor CRoly will say grace.”
No less than seventy electors, without the slightest hesitation,
showed their respect for their hospitable Alderman, by accepting
the counterfeit invitation; whereupon the villany was discovered ;
and the Globe, with its waggish gravity, assures us that a hand-bill
was put forth convening a public meeting, “to take into considera-
tion the unwarrantable proceeding which has recently disgraced the
ward.” Should the miscreants be discovered, we trust that Moon
will, in his Aldermanic capacity, sentence them to the severest
punishment that man could inflict upon man ; namely, that for
three months they should dine with him—and him alonel We can
answer for it, they would never make a joke afterwards. .
THE VENTILATION OF THE HOUSES.
Nothing can exceed the sufferings of the members of the Legislature
during the experiments that have been made by DR. REID in boiling them
up, and then cooling them down again. “Save us from the savans,” say
we, when they are trying anything in the shape of improvnent; for
science must have its victims. There is only one right way of doing
everything, while the series of wrong ways may be considered infinite ; and
as several of these wrong ways are tried before the right way is hit upon,
there must be an alarming sacrifice of somebody. DR. REID has pub-
lished an enormous book about ventilation, in which he says, “There are
no periods where the constitution demands such a variety of supply—(he
is talking of air)—as immediately before and after dinner.”
As the Houses sit immediately before and immediately after dinner, he,
the Doctor, thinks variety of air is necessary; and he accordingly favours
them with a succession of hot blasts, cold blasts, tepid blasts, temperate
blasts, freezing blasts, and blasts with the chill off. As the dinner hour
is the period for a good blow-out, DR. REID sets all his ventilators at
work at about the time specified.
The system, by which the Houses of Parliament are heated, is one by
which hot air comes up through the floor, and goes out through the
ceiling, at which a quantity of cold is constantly pouring in, so that the
feet of members are being continually cooked, like potatoes over a steam-
ing apparatus, and they are always getting blows on the head from some
invisible BoBEAs. We have heard a member declare, that his feet are
turned into boiled soles every evening, while his head has been like a
tête de veau glacée.
The great merit DR. REID finds in his own plan is, that any sort of
temperature that may be asked for can be supplied at a moment's notice.
Thus, if a member comes into the House in a violent heat he may order
a gust of 40 degrees to cool him; while another, who may be shivering
with cold, can call for a puff of 90, which will be as good as a blazing
fire to comfort him. This arrangement would be all very well if every
member could sit in his own draft, or if the ventilator could take such
a correct aim as to convey the blast, hot, cold, or temperate, as the case
may be—exactly to the gentleman who ordered it. Unfortunately, DR.
Reid's system cannot accomplish this measure. A gust which is more
than enough for one may prove too much for two, and the consequence
is, that the members do nothing but sneeze, cough, and blow their noses
all through the session. The Duke of WELLINGTON, who is tolerably
hardy, and from being long accustomed to Parliament is used to hot and
cold, has been compelled on leaving the House of Lords every night, to
pop his feet into hot water, encase his venerable head in a Welsh wig,
and demolish an enormous basin of thick gruel, in which the groats of
Emden find a watery grave,
Exeter Hall Insolvent I
Sin Culling EARDLEY SMITH, John DEAN PAUL, and JAMEs LQRP,
respectively the Chairman, Treasurer, and Secretary of a body calling
itself the Anti-Maynooth Committee, have issued a circular, stating, that
in opposing the Maynooth Endowment Bill that Association has contracted
debts to the amount of £732 14s. 11d., which it is unable to defray, and
demanding assistance, in order to discharge them. The Anti-Maynoºth
Committee has manifestly committed itself; but how can people have the
conscience to ask charity of others who have so little of it themselyes?
In stirring up the fires of religious animosity, the Exeter Hallites have
burnt their own fingers, and are deservedly smarting in consequence;
Let us hope that the burnt children—for childish enough they are—will
dread the fire. We shall not be sorry to see an execution put into their
hall, and their platform and other properties sold up. May, no misplaced
sympathy avert that most devoutly-to-be-wished consummation

MRS. CAUDLE”S CURTAIN LECTURES.
LECTURE XXIX.
MRS. CAUDLE THINKS “THE TIME HAS COME TO HAVE A COTTAGE
OUT OF TOWN.”
CAUDLE, you ought to have had something nice
to-night; for you're not well, love — I know
you’re not. Ha! that’s like you men,_so head-
strong | You will have it, that nothing ails you ;
but I can tell, CAUDLE. The eye of a wife-
and such a wife as I’ve been to you-can at
once see whether a husband's well or not. You’ve
been turning like tallow all the week; and what's
more, you eat nothing, now. It makes me melan-
choly to see you at a joint. I don't say any-
thing at dinner before the children; but I don't
feel the less. No, no; you’re not very well; and
you're not as strong as a horse. Don't deceive
yourself—nothing of the sort. No, and you don't
eat as much as ever; and if you do, you don't eat
with a relish, I'm sure of that. You can't deceive me there.
“But I know what's killing you. It's the confinement; it's the
bad air you breathe; it's the smoke of London. Oh yes, I know
your old excuse : you never found the air bad before... Perhaps not.
But as people grow older, and get on in trade—and, after all, we’ve
nothing to complain of, Caudle—London air always disagrees
with 'em. Delicate health comes with money: I’m sure of it.
What a colour you had once, when you'd hardly a sixpence; and
now, look at you !
“'Twould add thirty years to your life—and think what a blessing
that would be to me; not that I shall live a tenth part of the time–
thirty years, if you'd take a nice little house somewhere at Brixton.
You hate Brixton I must say it, CAUDLE, that’s so like you : any
place that’s really genteel, you can't abide. Now Brixton and
Balham Hill I think delightful. So select ' There, nobody visits
nobody, unless they're somebody. To say nothing of the delightful
pews that make the churches so respectable !
“However, do as you like. If you won't go to Brixton, what do
you say to Clapham Common Oh, that’s a very fine story ! ... Never
tell me ! No; you wouldn't be left alone, a Robinson Crusoe with wife
and children, because you’re in the retail way. What The retired
wholesales never visit the retired retails at Clapham Ha! that’s only your
old sneering at the world, MR. CAUDLE ; but I don’t believe it.
And after all, people should keep to their station, or what was this
life made for Suppose a tallow-merchant does keep himself above
a tallow-chandler,-I call it only a proper pride. What? You call it
the aristocracy of fat? I don't know what you mean by aristocracy;
but I suppose it’s only another of your dictionary words, that's
hardly worth the finding out.
“What do you say to Hornsey or Muswell Hill Eh! Too high 3
What a man you are Well then—Battersea Too low 2 You are
an aggravating creature, CAUDLE, you must own that I Hampstead,
then Too cold 3 Nonsense; it would brace you up like a drum,
CAUDLE ; and that’s what you want. But you don't deserve any-
body to think of your health or your comforts either. There's some
pretty spots, I’m told, about Fulham. Now, CAUDLE, I won't have
you say a word against Fulham. That must be a sweet place : dry,
and healthy, and every comfort of life about it—else is it likely that
a bishop would live there? Now, CAUDLE, none of your heathen
principles—I won’t hear 'em. I think what satisfies a bishop ought
to content you ; but the politics you learn at that club are dreadful.
To hear you talk of bishops—well, I only hope nothing will happen
to you, for the sake of the dear children I
“A nice little house and a garden I I know it—I was born for a

They’re ten times as sweet ! What? And twenty times as dear? Yes;
there you go Anything that I fancy, you always bring up the
expense.
“No, Ma. CAUDLE, I should not be tired of it in a month. I tell
you I was made for the country. But here you’ve kept me—and
much you’ve cared about my health—here you’ve kept me in this
filthy London, that I hardly know what grass is made of. Much you
care for your wife and family to keep ’em here to be all smoked like
bacon. I can see it—it's stopping the children's growth; they’ll be
dwarfs, and have their father to thank for it. If you’d the heart of
a parent, you couldn't bear to look at their white faces. Dear little
Dick he makes no breakfast. What? He ate six slices this morning?
A pretty father you must be to count 'em. But that’s nothing to

“Ha! and when we could be so comfortable 1 But it's always the
case, you never will be comfortable with me. How nice and fresh
you’d come up to business every morning; and what pleasure it
would be for me to put a tulip or a pink in your button-hole, just, as
I may say, to ticket you from the country. But then, CAUDLE, you
never were like any other man But I know why you won't leave
London. Yes, I know. Then, you think, you couldn't go to your
filthy club—that’s it. Then you’d be obliged to be at home, like
any other decent man. Whereas, you might, if you liked, enjoy
yourself under your own apple-tree, and I’m sure I should never say
anything about your tobacco out of doors. My only wish is to make
you happy, CAUDLE, and you won’t let me do it.
“You don't speak, love Shall I look about a house to-morrow
It will be a broken day with me, for I’m going out to have little

cave, the better. You're getting not fit for Christian society. What

bored, and so were dear mother's, and grandmother's before her;

yours, MR. CAUDLE : Besides, – why should little pet's ears go
naked, any more than any of her sisters ? They wear ear-rings,

that's all with your filthy politics again. You'd shake all the world

all. But little pet shall be bored, and don't think to prevent it. - I
suppose she's to be married some day, as well as her sisters ? And
who'll look at a girl without ear-rings, I should like to know? If
you knew anything of the world, you'd know what a nice diamond

“I don’t know what I answered,” says CAUDLE, “but I know this ;

from thinking this salary too much, we consider the functionaries, are
underpaid, if they have to remove all the dirty things, both real and ima-
ginary, that people lay at the door of the House of Commons.

* GOING BACKWARDS.”
It is the proud office of the DUKE of ARGYLL to bear the crown
of England before the Sovereign on state occasions. However, it is
not etiquette for the subject to turn his back upon his Monarch;
though history shows us that this, has been done too. However, in
the prorogation of Parliament, the DUKE of ARGYLL carrying the
crown and going backwards, slipped down two stairs—fell—and
down, with a crash, fell the crown of England 1
(But what was to be expected after the Maynooth Grant Certain
we are that however SIR. Robert Inglis might have lamented the
calamity, he was not taken by surprise by it. MR. PLUMPTRE, too,
—we are sure of it—looked at SIR Rob ERT with an expressive
mixture of the dismal and the knowing, as much as to say—“I told
you so t”)
Several of the diamonds were knocked out of the crown, and
Dukes and Marquesses were picking them up like so many SIND-
BADs. The DUKE of WELLINGTon, we learn, immediately became
the historian of the Fall of the Crown, and in his own short-sword
way, narrated the mishap to the Peeresses. Fair cheeks became pale,
and many and eloquent were the “dear me's 1” However, when the
QUEEN quitted the throne, “the housekeeper appeared in front of it,
thus taking charge of the position.” We know not wherefore ; for
who in the House of Lords would have pocketted the Crown-jewels:
However, even among Peers, housekeepers we suppose ought to be
cautious. At length, all the jewels were found, and the crown
sent to be repaired, no doubt to the loss of MR. Swift, of the
Tower, who shows it; for sure we are that in its battered state people
would have given an extra threepence to see it : there is something
so attractive in the misfortunes of the great.
However, our chief business is not with the accident, but to suggest
that every means be taken to prevent a recurrence of the calamity.
It is plain that the education of the DUKE or ARGYLL has been
sadly neglected. Peers, and others destined to play parts in a court,
ought from their earliest infancy to be taught to walk backwards; to
ride backwards ; if possible—and it is possible we know—to think
backwards. We have wet-nurses and dry-nurses: we ought to have
nurses for the backward step. A proneness in a noble child to walk
forward like a mere human animal, should be repressed with the same
anxiety that we now watch a tendency to bandiness. In fact, better
be bandy than forward. To be an extraordinary backward child,
ought to make the best praise of a courtier in short clothes. And
these lessons in backwardness we would have so given that they might
visibly associate with them the person of the monarch. Thus we
would have the Royal Portrait in every nursery, that the children
might play at ball and battledore and shuttlecock, always backing
from the regal countenance. Or, as the good Mussulman always says
his prayers with his face to the East, the backward pupil might be
taught the various situations of the various palaces, and always
reverently face the one whereat the royal standard should be flying.
We are very earnest in this matter. For is it not a sad thing that
an elderly gentleman should be called upon to walk in a way that,
when God made man, it was never intended that man should walk?
Hence this fall of man, or fall of Duke 1
There are, we know, hasty thinkers, superstitious quidnuncs, likely
to predict some evil, to see a bad omen in this accident to the
English diadem. Crowns have, we know, been shivered by going
backwards, but that—despite the mishap to the DUKE of ARGYLL–
that can never happen to the crown of QUEEN VIcToai.A. Never-
theless, we hope, for the sake of all parties, that those who shall
henceforth convey the crown, will be allowed to go forwards. Then,
certain we are, the crown will lose no one of its jewels. The olden
bigotry may love the back step: but the spirit of our day cries—
“Forwards !”
SONG OF THE SORDID SWEETHEART.
I Loved thee for thy money,
For wealth, . was thine;
But, finding thou hast none, I
Thy heart and hand resign.
Think not I wish to pain thee,
Deem not I use thee ill :
I like thee;—but maintain thee,
I neither can nor will.
I thought thee quite a treasure-
A bond fide sum,
And dreamt of joy and pleasure
That never were to come :
The house—the hounds—the horses—
Thy fortune would allow ;
The wines—the dozen courses;–
That dream is over now !
Not for thy charms I wooed thee,
Though thou wast passing fair;
Not for thy mind I sued thee,
Though stored with talents rare :
Thine income 'twas that caught me,
For that I held thee dear;
I trusted thou’dst have brought me
Five thousand pounds a year.
That hope, alas ! is blighted,
Thereon I will not dwell;
I should have been delighted
To wed thee—but, farewell !
My feelings let me smother,
Hard though the struggle be,
And try and find another,
Rich as I fancied thee.
&THE TREASURES OF THE DEEP.”
THE following intelligence—quoted from the Hampshire Telegraph—
comes from free-hearted, liberty-loving, America :—
“By a private letter which has reached us from Gibraltar, we are informed, upon
good authority, that 20,000 slave shackles, for men, women, and children-in all four-
teen cart-loads—have been fished up from the wreck of the American war-steamer,
Missouri, lately burnt at that port.”
Now, as the timbers and other relics of our Royal George have been
worked into boxes and nick-nacks, we propose to Americans—the traders
of the human shambles, the money-seeking breeders of “God’s likeness
in ebony”—that they should turn the penny with these 20,000 slave
shackles. If wrought into utensils for domestic use, or what would still
be better, turned into ornaments for the women of America, they would
endear to them that sweet principle which coins money from the “marrow
and the bones of man.” Some of these shackles might also be manu-
factured into steel clasps for the bibles of the very religious breeders of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI. 87
THE LAST
FARCE AT DRURY LANE.
HERE was nothing dur-
ing the past sea-
son that emanated
from the genius
that rules the des-
tinies of Drury
Lane, certainly no-
thing half so comic
as the late report
laid before the
General Assembly
of Proprietors.
Could the Poet
BUNN stoop to
prose, we should
be inclined to be-
lieve that the do-
cument was the
work of his tre-
mendous brain. It
has many of his literary characteristics. There is a freedom of style about it,
a sort of touch-and-go manner, elevated too with a strong feeling of the
romantic, that now and then reminds us of the Poet's happiest vein. We keenly
regret that it was not thrown into verse, set to music by the Poet's own
musician, BALFE, and then duly executed by the operatic company. It would
have been much more consolatory to the feelings of the proprietors—(who are
once a year solemnly called together to be told there is not a sixpence to be
shared among them)—and quite as intelligible. The report, to begin with, is
brimful of loyalty:—
“It is gratifying to the Committee to be able to state, that, amidst the wreck of the national
drama, Her Most Gracious MAJEsty continues her patronage and support to the theatre, by her visits,
both in state and in private.”
Certainly it is impossible to overrate the condescension of the QUEEN, who
visits Drury Lane “amidst the wreck of the national drama!” We have often
felt our sympathies touched by the daring of the Deal boatmen, who visit a ship
“amidst the wreck.” But this is as nothing to the courage and humanity of
HER MAJEsty, who goes to assist at operas written by an imported Frenchman,
amidst the wreck of English tragedy, comedy, and farce. Besides, did not the
Poet BUNN himself do all within his mighty energies to bring about the aforesaid
wreck? It is a little bold in the offender who maliciously scuttles a ship, to
bellow when the craft is going to the bottom.
“It is 'matter for consolation, that since the Legislature of the country has thought proper to
extend, by their late act of Parliament, the powers of the Lord Chamberlain, and remove the drama
from the two national theatres to Sadler's Wells, the Yorkshire Stingo, the Eagle Tavern, and a host
of minor establishments to the number of thirty, that M R. BuNN has been enabled to furnish an
entertainment worthy of the Royal patronage and the public at large.”
As the Poet himself says—for we are almost certain it is he-" it is matter
for consolation” (though we know not to whom) that though the drama is
wrecked, BuNN can yet furnish an entertainment to set before a Queen. Part
of the crew have taken to the jolly-boat, and rowed to Sadler's Wells; but
BUNN, like Robinson Crusoe, has saved enough from the ship to keep himself
in excellent case. Nevertheless, BUNN, in that confusion of ideas that will
sometimes bewilder the clearest wits, does somewhat fail in his pattern respect
for the QUEEN; for he must recollect that it was HER MAJEsty's La Reine
le reut that made the law that “removed the drama” to Sadler's Wells. But
high poets, like high mountains, have, now and then, their tops in mist.
“An act of the greatest injustice has thereby been inflicted upon the national theatres, and
most certainly demands compensation at the hands of those who legislate for the drama, and who are
bold enough to contend that they are upholding it by legalising the representation of SHAkspeaRE
at pot-houses and public gardens.”
No doubt. And the same spirit that grants compensation to Drury Lane
against the Eagle Tavern, should also award it to Astley's against Drury
Lane. Who were the first robbers? Who stole the horses from the ring, and
the lions and tigers from the menagerie Answer, gentlemen of the General
Committee.
The Poet. BUNN thus modestly winds up :-
“The Committee trust that they have acted judiciously in retaining their lessee, and hope he is too
well satisfied with the terms of the agreement to seek to disturb it.”
We can answer for the Poet, yes.
The Report being read, the conversation took a very lively turn. One Captain
SPENCER (“the Captain’s a bold man”) painted the Poet BUNN in the prettiest
colours, and then tried his hand at a little black on MR. MAcREADY. This
bold officer spoke as follows:–
“With respect to the performance of what was denominated the legitimate drama, he was prepared
to show that the most disastrous consequences had arisen from the management of MR. M.AcasADY.”
Then wherefore regret the removal of the legitimate
drama if it were so unprofitable Or has the experience
of CAPTAIN SPENcER as a proprietor made him, like
Jaffler, “pleased with ruin”?
“This, however, he was anrious to prope—that there had been more
money received from Mr. Bunn and music in two years than had been
paid by Mr. MacReady during the same duration of time. For instance,
he found that the committee had received in two years from BUNN and
music, 8,000l.; from MacREA.ny and legitimate drama, 3,425l. ; leaving
a balance in favour of “Bunn and music” of 4,575l.”
Doubtless, the Captain was “anxious to prove” his
case; but arithmetic is not to be conquered, even by
Captains. As a proprietor he ought to have known that
Mä. MacREADY entirely furnished the theatre, and then
came the Poet BUNN and took possession. Everything
was made to BUNN’s hands; even the property lyre,
whereto he sings his ravishing strains... Captain
SPEncER, had he not been a proprietor, would, of course,
have known this ; but the Captain spoke from what we
will indulgently suppose extreme simplicity. Captains
are so unsophisticated.
Having, in our small way, laboured for free trade in
the drama, we congratulate the town upon this Report,
that, despite of itself, allows the value of the reform that
has permitted ShakspeaRE to travel to Islington. We
are convinced that in due season a better sort of drama
will originate at the minor theatres; better actors will
then appear—and when they do come, how heartily will
Punch welcome them 1
THE PERFIDIOUS ENGLISH IN PARIS.
OUR correspondent informs us, that several Englishmen
have been apprehended in Paris. Not content with the
calamity worked by John BULL at Toulon, they had hired
spacious cellars, and were very busily engaged getting up an
earthquake for the destruction of the whole capital. The
horror was to have come off on the first of next April. A
grocer who discovered the plot has been rewarded with the
legion of honour !
THE POLITICAL TOM BO L.A.
Most of our readers have no doubt seen a toy made of
plaster of Paris, and called a Tombola. It consists of a little
figure, which only requires to be pushed gently on one side,
when it will go rolling about from right to left, from Tory to
Whig ; so that it will be quite impossible to say which side
it will permanently remain upon.
we have seen figures of the QUEEN, PRINCE ALBERT,
and a Chinese Mandarin, taken as models for these toys;
but we are surprised that the PREMIER, whose political
movements point him out as the very thing for it, should
never yet have figured as a Tombola. Now that Punch has
- ---
-- ~
-
thrown out the hint, the PREMIER may make º his mind to
find himself promoted to the heads of all the Italian image-
boys. It is true that there would be very little imagery in
anything so purely matter-of-fact as PEEL's oscillation from
side to side on the field of politics.

The spirit of Chivalry of THE House or commons.
The masterly Cartoon of MAcL1s E has only one fault which Mr. Punch feels it
his duty to rectify. The error to which we allude is making the various figures
in the Cartoon ideal instead of real personages. It was a beautiful saying of
REYNolds, or Doctor Johnson, or Bon APARTE, or Great Metropolis GRANT,
that “We care nothing for a face we don't know, but a familiar eye will lash up
long dormant memories, and a nose we know will, in preference to a nose that
nobody knows, come home to the recollections of all of us.”
We regret therefore, that MacLise did not render his conception perfect by
“filling in" with portraits of the remarkable men of the present day—men with
whom the pencil of Punch has rendered the public familiar, though the familiarity
established may have bred contempt in two or three instances.
But to the great Cartoon of the “Spirit of Chivalry:” in the centre you will see
the SPEAKER as the very personification of Chivalry,
surrounded by men of various pursuits and various poli-
tics. In the background is the Duke of WELLINGTon
staring at vacancy through a pair of spectacles."
On the other side is PEEL, looking like a chivalrous
knight who has got a good account at his bankers',
while STANLEY scowls at his side as if jealous of the
£clat that his companion in arms has monopolised.
Beneath is BRough AM in the character of a Seer or
Soothsayer, who never says anything to soothe, but
always something to irritate. Still lower down is
O'Connell in the character of a Bard, inspiring
Youth—that is to say, D'IsrAELI, commonly called
Young England Ben—by a series of recitals, in which
he is playing as usual the “precious lyre.”
Among them may be seen Roebuck offering up the
sword of duelling, but retaining in his possession the
envenomed dagger of slander, while Punch is seen in
the centre as “the poet-historian from whom future
ages must derive their knowledge of the spirit and the
deeds” of the chivalry of politics. GRAHAM, who has
the valour and hardihood to brazen out the hostility
which all his actions create, with a few others too
insignificant to specify, complete a Cartoon which will
go down to posterity, or rather will go down with
posterity, as pleasantly as it is eagerly swallowed by the
public of the present age. -

RAILWAY TRAVELLING...—“SIX HOURS IN A
CORN-FIELD.”
A young lady, christened CLARIssa, has written a very
pretty letter to the Post, on the late accident on the
Northern and Eastern Line: she, “a young lady of some
birth,”—by which it appears there are young ladies who
are only partly born—“was placed in a corn-field.” The
road was to be repaired in half-an-hour: nobody went for
conveyances, and the young lady, like another Ruth,
“sick for home,” sat six hours “amid the alien corn!”
But let it not be thought we laugh at the sorrows of
this poor young lady. Fair CLARIssa not we. No had
we known them, we would — always allowing that we
could—have sent a lark above that corn-field, over your
fair and patient head, “singing like an angel in the sky."
We have dwelt upon the circumstance in all its atrocity,
to warn travellers by the Northern and Eastern Line to
take bedding with them—a pocket mattress and half-a-
dozen blankets—that when left in a corn-field for six hours,
they may fare a little better than the bewildered maid,
whose condition will, we trust, cut remorsefully into the
hearts of the barbarians of the Northern and Eastern
Line.

3pumtb's £lettion Intelligent.
lºgue tranquil suburb of Kensington has long
been in a state of rabid excitement on account
of a vacancy having been declared in the su-
pernumerary beadledom. It was at one time
supposed that Pum MELL, who has long worn
the purple—a very dark-blue official coat—was
about to lay down the cane, and retire into
the privacy of his own shop; for Pum MELL,
like Polonius, is not only an officer of state,
but “a fishmonger.” On making inquiry at
the respected beadle's own house, the answer
returned was, “never say die;” and it is be-
lieved that PUMMELL will continue to pummel to the last the
refractory urchins of Kensington. It is, however, found necessary
to appoint a supernumerary beadle, for the energetic officer we
have named was found to be rapidly sinking under the cares of
the laced hat, while the weight of the cape was more than one man
could possibly bear up under.
No complaint, however, not a murmur of any kind, not a sigh, or
even a groan, has escaped the lips of the persevering PUMMELL. It
is the opinion of the pew-opener that the good man and energetic
officer would have died “with harness on his back,” like Macbeth in
the play, and poor old Jack in the dust-cart. At length the superior
authorities, seeing that the beadle of their boyhood, the PUMMELL
of their playful hours, was being rapidly crushed under the parochial
beaver—at length, we say, the superior authorities of Kensington
resolved on appointing a supernumerary beadle; and the contest for
the additional cane, collar, cape, and cuffs, has thrown Kensington
into a continued ferment for the last four weeks.
Some of the inhabitants have taken a constitutional objection to
the creation of an extra beadledom, and they declare they have read
the Reform Act through and through, over and over again, back-
wards and forwards, upside down, and topsy turvy, without finding
anything in the measure to justify the course that has been resolved
upon. They say that though Finsbury may send two members to
Parliament, Kensington has no right to send two beadles anywhere.
That, however, is a matter for future consideration. Even the
appointment of Pum MELL himself is'hot exactly like the laws of the
Medes and Persians—irrevocable.
Having just skimmed the surface of this bit of constitutional doc-
trine, we proceed to the more immediate subject of interest—the
election for the extra beadledom.
Pum MELL, with his customary tact and delicacy, altogether refuses
to aid the pretensions of either party. One of the candidates, how-
ever, comes forward on the railway interest, and he professes to be
ready to extend Punch's Kensington Railway, but where on earth he
is to draw the line is at present a mystery.
His adversary calls himself the farmer's friend; but as there is
not a farm in the whole parish, his friend the farmer must have very
little local influence.
CANDIDATE No. 1 insists that the rail must triumph over every-
thing, which is in fact advising the process of ruling with a rod of
Iron.
CANDIDATE No. 2 asks what is to become of agriculture if
the country is cut up for railroads, and calls upon the people of
Kensington to rally round their lettuces and their fruit-trees, and to
* the standard as well as the espalier of liberty in its native
Soli.
Not wishing to give an undue advantage to either of the candidates,
we refrain from deciding on the pretensions of either; but we do
hope that Kensington, which is now labouring under a general
attack of the heart-burn, will soon be restored to its former state of
cordiality and good feeling, by a decision one way or the other of
this most acharmé contest.
The Engines of War.
A NEw office has been established at Algiers. It is called the Office
d'Avocat des Arabes, and has been established to defend the natives in
trials, and cases of emergency. To carry out this humane intention, we
hope Marshal Bugeaud will see that there is a fire brigade added to the
establishment, with a strong detachment of engines.
THE STATE OF THE ROYAL NURSERY.
THE venerable HomeR, they say, sometimes nods; but our equally
venerable Laureat seems to be always snoring. Nevertheless, we cannot
help regretting that he should have missed many good chances of coming
before the public; among others, that furnished by the QUEEN's Visit to
Germany. We consider that in the composition of the following lines, in
connection with that event, we are absolutely doing his work for him, and
we accordingly expect him to bestow a leaf from his chaplet on us, if not
to “stand” a bottle of his official Malmsey. With this brief preface
introduce we our more brief Poem; to wit:-
SPECULATION.—A SONNET OF THE PALACE.
I wonDER what the Royal children do,
Now that their gracious parents are away;
Whether like mice, when puss is out, they play,
And turn their princely nursery upside down;
Presuming on the absence of the Crown,
Frisking and frolicking, with gambols gay,
And shouting “Whoop !” and “Hip, hip, hip, hooray !”—
To use a common phrase—till all is blue?
For the blood royal, sure, is human still ;
And well we know what children are about,
What time the darlings know their mother's out.
But whither wanders my presumptuous quill
Haply, whilst thus I build my loyal rhyme,
The babes august are crying all the time.
TO SIR. E. BULWER LYTTON, BART.
SIR,
You dedicate the last edition of your “Zanoni” to GIBson, the
sculptor, in these words:
“I, artist in words, dedicate to you, artist whose ideas speak in marble, this well-
loved work of my matured manhood. I love it not the less because it has been little
understood, and superficially judged, by the common herd. It was not meant for them.”
Now, SIR. Edward, this is not fair to the circulating libraries. It's
all very well to talk of the “common herd” and say it “was not meant
for them,” with a curl of your fine lip; but you know it was meant for
everybody who could pay threepence for a perusal of the volumes—and
very popular it has been, especially with ladies'-maids andmilliners.
You call yourself “artist in words;” this is not origi There is a
man in Oxford Street who calls himself “artist in hair,” and you ought, in
justice, to dedicate your next novel to him. There is an analogy between
your work and his, which I can’t discover between yours and Ginson's.
His material is as flimsy, his workmanship as dexterous, as your own.
He will spin you a landscape or a cipher, a memento mori or a motto,
with equal facility—and it shall be but hair after all. So you, SIR
Edward, have spun for us a sentimental highwayman, a high-souled
felon, a speculative seducer, a philosophic dandy, and yet the stuff of all
was one and the same—“self.” SIR Edward, “self.”
Why are you always complaining The public read your novels;
the publishers pay for them : you are a lion at dinners, a thing to point at
in the streets. What would man have more ? It is all very well to put
off a clever pinchbeck imitation for gold—we grant the skill of the
workmanship and the workman,—but it is too bad to insist on our
acknowledging it to be genuine gold, and to call us “common herd,” when
we give you a sturdy “no.”
Forgive your friendly monitor for the tone he has taken towards you.
We have no objection to your considering yourself ill-used; but you
become a bore when you are always dinning it in our ears. A play of
yours is successful—we are “a discriminating public.” Your next play is
dammed—we are a “common herd.” Your Pilgrims of the Rhine
makes a hit in Germany; you dedicate one edition to the German public,
as philosophical critics, or something of the sort.
You must not be allowed to fancy you hold the scales quite so firmly
and uncontestedly; that your works are the gauge and test of artistic
judgment and taste, in this way; and it is to remind you of this, that we
have taken up our pen, with which, nevertheless, we subscribe ourselves,
. Your admirer (within limits),
33&H$2C#.
A Very Good Excuse.
WE have been assured, on the best authority, that the absence of the
Sun is attributable solely to the fact, that since he has acquired so much
fame by his photogenic pictures, he has been keeping out of the way for
fear he should be made President of the Royal Academy.

THE DROP SCENES OF LONDON. ;
THE LYCEUM.
We are not aware to whose four pound brush, and ingenious paint-pot, we are indebted for the
design of the Lyceum Drop, but there can be no doubt that his whole, soul was in his pipkin, when
he imagined the extraordinary scene with which he has enriched the gallery of dramatic drop-
scenes in this metropolis. The character of the landscape is decidedly pastoral—though some fruit
and bottles in one corner shows that “apples, oranges, ginger-beer, bottled-porter, and a bill of the
play,” were all running in the artist's head when he made the design which is the subject of our
critical comments. The principal object in the picture—and a precious object we must admit

quite in character.
The sage, by the bye, has got a book in his hand, and his eyes seem to be starting out of his head
-drawn prºbably by the onions immediately under him. His cottage in the background is smoking
away at such a rate as to lead one to suppose that the sage has not tried the patent apparatus for
curing chimneys, or that the Smoke Prohibition Bill does not extend to this particularly pastoral
district. A Party of Irish reapers are kicking up a species of fillaloo under a large tree, which
combines the trunk of the oak with the leaves of the gooseberry, the flowers of the daffodowndilly,
and the fruit of the pine-apple. An enormous thistle in the foreground has been thrown in to shoº
that the sage is not such a donkey as he looks, or the thistle would not be safe within only a few
yards of him. Altogether the picture is a proof of the triumph of scene-painting over the difficulties
which Nature throws in the way of the artist.
The few sheep in the foreground are dreadfully woolly, but they tell a little story of themselves; for
when we look at the one standing up, we are enabled to say, with the poet, “thereby hangs a tale”
of no common order.
PUNCH ON THE SILKWORM.
So dazzling is the magnificence of the ladies' dresses at the balls and assemblies of the nobility
and gentry, that it is but a safe precaution, on entering one, to put on a pair of green spectacles.
The finery, however, in a short time becomes tolerable; and then the now thinking mind inquires,
what did it cost? We refer that question, in a financial sense, to the Lords—and gentlemen—
whom it concerns, and who will discuss it, no doubt, with a due proportion of groans. Fine fashions
cºst something more than fine fortunes. Silks, it is well known, cannot be produced without
silkworms; but it is not known as generally that their making up involves the sacrifice of numbers
of those poor things. -
The silkworms we allude to possess legs and arms, which are not, however, by any means in the
condition in which arms and legs ought to be. These said silkworms are very generally kept shut
up in close, ill-aired cages, at work, not only from morning to night, but also from morning to
morning; in consequence of which they are mostly very sickly, and numbers of them are continually
dying off... Need we say that our silkworms are the creatures commonly known as Needle.
women Now the disease most incidental and most fatal to these human silkworms is Consumption.
It is a shocking, though very common, occur-
rence, to hear of a young lady destroyed in
her prime by the malady just mentioned;
whose origin it is no less common to hear
ascribed to a cold caught at a ball. Now, as
the atmosphere of Almack's is much more
consumptive than that of Billingsgate, and as
dances in the open air on a village green are
considerably less dangerous than at the Han-
over Square Rooms, we have our doubts about
ºnnexion of the disease, in such cases, with
COIOI.
The question has been mooted, whether
consumption is contagious. We do not mean
to assert that it is ; and we would not frighten I
anybody, especially a sensitive young lady, or
her anxious mamma, unnecessarily; but we do
declare that we should not, were it consistent
with our sex, at all like to be in the frocks of |
those whose dresses have been worked by con-
sumptive fingers.
this subject, except that we hope we have
now thrown out a little hint, which may induce #
those for whom it is intended to interest them-
selves, for their own sakes, in behalf of the
over-worked silkworms.

INDIAN MAIL AT BOULOGNE.
Awful complaints are made of the treatment ||
of the Indian Mail on its arrival at Boulogne.

has a boat, at fifteen pounds a day, waiting to
bring over its separate express, and the Herald
goes to the same expense for the same purpose,
the British Government allows its officer only
a five-pound note to make the best bargain he
can with any one who will take him as a pas-
senger. One day the unfortunate man was
compelled to go to sea in an open boat, a party
of fishermen having agreed to get the poor
fellow and his letters across somehow or other,
for the shabby stipend that he was enabled to
offer them. A squall, however, came up, and
the Indian Mail, with the officer in charge,
were nearly going to the bottom, when the
packet, returning from carrying over the Times
dispatch, picked up the representative of the
British post-office, and towed him with all his
letters back to port again. The position in
which he is sometimes placed by not being able
to go higher than a “five-pun note,” for his
conveyance across the Channel, is sometimes
very distressing. He is obliged to haggle with
steam-boat captains, and very frequently gets
hooted after by the very cabin boys, as “the
cove wot wants to go across by hexpress, and
harn’t got the money to pay for it.” Some-
times he has a row in broken French with the [
owners of the fishing-boats, and he has been
several times threatened with the fate of the
Noyades, for offering a paltry cent-wingt-cing
francs for what the mariners declare vaut bien
mieur que cela, on account of the importance
of the expedition, and the danger attending it. :
Something should be done immediately to pro-
vide the means of safe and speedy transit for
the Indian Mail on its arrival at Boulogne.

C. H. E.A.P TO U R S.
We understand that a company is being formed for the purpose of
accommodating the public with cheap tours by taking them in parties of
from four or six, to forty or sixty, on small excursions, at very reduced
prices. The first experiment is to be tried with the Daisy, which is to be
chartered for Chelsea, and will take a four hours' excursion, taking in
its passengers at London Bridge, stopping at the Temple, to enable the
| excursionists to view the beautiful gardens of that enchanting neighbour-
hood. The steam will be then got up, and the tourists will proceed to
Hungerford, where the vessel will be made fast, to allow of a guide
coming on board, who will give some particulars of the commerce, arts,
science, literature, and population of the locality. The vessel will then
be steered southward, and will remain long enough at the foot of West:
minster Bridge to allowan antiquarian to be taken on board, who will read
a paper on the history of the bridge, and will show some specimens of
shells found during the repairs under one of the centre arches.
The antiquarian will be put ashore at Milibank, and * will
be shipped, who will explain the revenues of the see of Canterbury, and
recite an ode to Lambeth Palace. The reverendigentleman will disem-
bark at Vauxhall, and a comic singer will beintroduced in his place, to sing
a comic song about railroads, which will continue until the arrival of the
vessel at Battersea, when a Professor of Chemistry will join the party,
and deliver a lecture on Chemistry, winding up by administering the
laughing gas. At Chelsea the Captain of the steamer will dance a naval
| hornpipe on the paddle-box, and the passengers may have an opportunity
of promenading on the pier, after which they will proceed on their home-
ward voyage. We understand that the whole of this is expected to be
accomplished for the small charge of eightpence each person.

THE AGE OF AIR.
We have had Ages of Iron, Bronze, and other metals; but the present
times appear to be tending towards an Age of Air. We are, it seems, to
be blown along on atmospheric railways, and balloons are now advertised
to start regularly from all the suburban places of amusement. MR.
|GREEN is to go up, or is about to go up, by moonlight, and we understand
that in order to make sure of a moon on the night that it would be wanted,
an arrangement has been made with MR. BRADwell, to fix the original
Colosseum moon, “for that night only,” over the gardens which the
balloon is advertised to start from.
To revert, however, to the Age of Air. We perceive that a new perio-
dical has been started, called the Balloon, and addressed especially to
aeronauts. As we believe the number of aeronauts in England comprises
a small bunch of GREENs, a couple of GRAHAMs, and one HAMPton, who pass

THE BRITISH LION BANKRUPT I
The world must remember how SIRCULLING SMITH talked about
the British Lion at the time of the Maynooth Grant debate. “The
British Lion was at length aroused,” and would never again become
passant, until it had torn every vestige of Popery to bits. It delighted
us to hear the baronet talk so confidently of the Lion's intentions.
It proved to us that he was in habits of closest intimacy with the
magnanimous brute. That, like VAN AMBurgh with the vulgar
beast, he could put his head in the British Lion's mouth, and know
its innermost mystery: that, with Wondsworth, he could say— -
*And now I see with eye serene,
The very pulse of the machine.”
Nevertheless, though we admired the prophetic boldness of Sin
Culling, it may be recollected that we then somewhat doubted the
truth of his predictions. We believed that the Lion after lashing its
tail, and roaring, and pacing up and down, and crunching the May-
nooth grant—that shin of beef thrown to Ireland—in its jaws, would
go to sleep just like any of MR. TYLER's lions in the Surrey
ells.
-
We thought this would be the extent of its pusillanimity.
But no the British Lion, so rampant in Exeter Hall, so vociferous,
so indomitable, is become a whining pauper : We give evidence of
the leonine shame. The Central Anti-Maynooth Committee (one of
the British Lion's many aliases,) have put forth a petition begging
for supplies, stating that “the Protestant cause may be greatly
impaired by any delay in the payment of their debts.”
And is it come to this? The terrific Lion, with its eye of burning
coal, and its attitude ofter-
rible menace, the British
Lion with a hang-dog look,
squatted,like ablind man's
cur, upon its hind legs,
begging ignominiously for
a halfpenny!
Oh, champions of the
Protestant cause ! and will
you-like mendicants—
lead about the British
Lion in a string? Will
you-can you, consider-
ing the pet that Lion was
to you, - can you see
the shamefaced creature
brought to such astrait
Should you not rather hush
up its state of destitution,
and, tender of its reputa-
tion, subscribe silently to
supply its necessities? If
you do not this, what a
shame will fall upon you!
Hard-judging men will
suspect that, with all your
--------
veneration for the British Lion, you care not to sacrifice its
dignity to a love of your own lucre ; that with all your professed
affection for the magnanimous brute, you hesitate not to sellit for
the vilest purposes: that you would not stickle to barter its mane
for chair-stuffing, its tail for a bell-rope, and its royal hide for a door-
mat I ºn Hoº
Heroes of the Protestant cause tº Mouth-martyrs of Exeter Hall !
If you have no ready cash, meltdown your plate.

Military Justice.
THERE have been several revolting cases of military flogging at Win-
chester. We propose that the classical figure of Justice be altered for
the especial use of the Army. The sword should be taken from her, as
an instrument not cutting deep enough, and the cat-o-nine-tails put
into her hand instead. The bandage over her eyes should remain the
same; for it would never do for Justice to see the cruelties that are
practised in the Army under her sacred name.

94 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
INTRODUCTION.
The only man of any mark
In all the town remaining,
I sauntered in St. James's Park,
And watched the daylight waning.
“The SpeakER's lips,” I said, “are sealed,
They’ve shut up both the Houses;
SiR Robert's gone to Turnabout field,
SIB JAMEs to shoot the grouses.
The QUEEN and all the Court are out
In Germany and Flanders,
And, happy midst his native kraut,
My princely ALBERT wanders.
No more the dumpy Palace arch
The Royal Standard graces;
Alone, upon his lonely march,
The yawning sentry paces.”
Beneath an elm-tree, on a bank,
I mused, (for tired my hunch was,)
And there in slumber soft I sank,
And this the dream of Punch was. *-
THE DREAM.
I dreamed it was a chair of gold,
The grassy bank I sat on ;
I dreamed SAINT Edward's sceptre old
I wielded for a baton.
Men crowded to my throne, the elm,
In reverend allegiance;
And Punch was publish'd through the realm,
The jolliest of Regents.
Back came the ministerial rout
From touring and carousing;
Back came SIR. Bob from Turnabout,
And back SiR JAMEs from grousing.
I turn'd upon a scornful heel,
When GRAHAM ask'd my favour;
I sternly banish'd Bobby PEEL
To Turnabout for ever,
To courtly ABERDEEN, I sent
A mission influential,
To serve the Yankee President
As Flunky Confidential. -
LoRD BRough AM AND WAux in banishment
I order'd to Old Reekie,
And STANLEY to New Zealand went
Ambassador to Heki.
And KELLY, whom the world assails,
But whom the bar takes fame from,
, I made Lord Wiscount New South Wales
Where poor John Tawell came from.
And then I asked His Grace, the Duke,
What ministers to go to,
On which he generously took
The Cabinet in toto. -
Oſthen! all other reigns which shine
Upon our page domestic,
Were mean and dim compared to mine,
That Regency majestic.
And ages hence the English realm
Shall tell the wondrous legend
Of Punch, when at the nation's helm,
HER MAJESTY's High Regent.
Around my empire's wide frontier
No greedy bully swaggered,
Nor swindling Yankee buccaneer,
Nor savage Gallic braggart.
For threats and arms were flung aside,
And war-ships turned to traders,
And all our ports were opened wide,
To welcome the invaders.
At home the cottier coursed his hare,
Beside the Duke his neighbour;
The weaver got his living fair
For his ten hours of labour.

And every man without employ
Got beef-not bones—to feed on,
And every little working boy
His page of Punch could read on.
And Irishmen learned common sense,
And prudence brought them riches;
Repeal ceased pilfering for pence
In PADDY's mended breeches.

And in a Union jolly -
I linked MAC HALE with TREshAM GREgg,
And BEREsford with CRolly.
Then gentlemen might earn their bread,
And think there was no shame in 't ;
And at my court might hold their head
Like any Duke'or Dame in 't.
A Duchess and her governess

I asked old WELLINGton to mess,
And meet a half-pay, Captain.

I know not where my fancy strayed,
My dream grew wilder—bolder—
When suddenly a hand was laid
Full roughly on my shoulder.
It was the Guardian of the Park,-.
The sun was sunk in Heaven ;
“Git up,” says he, “it’s after dark,
We shuts at half-past seven.”
And so I rose and shook myself,
And, satiatus ludi,
Resigned the crown to Royal GUELPH,
Aud went to tea to JUDY.

“I’m sure a woman might as well be buried alive as live here.
In fact, I am buried alive; I feel it. I stood at the window three
hours this blessed day, and saw nothing but the postman. No : it
isn’t a pity that I hadn't something better to do ; I had plenty: but
that’s my business, MR. CAUDLE. I suppose I’m to be mistress
of my own house ! If not, I’d better leave it.
“And the very first night we were here, you know it, the black-
beetles came into the kitchen. If the place didn't seem spread all
over with a black cloth, I'm a story-teller. What are you coughing

hate black-beetles, as I hate ill-treatment, MR. CAUDLE. And now
I have enough of both, goodness knows :

two, they'll walk up into the bed-room. They’ll be here—regiments
of 'em—on the quilt. But what do you care Nothing of the sort

why you’re so quiet. A pleasant thing to have black-beetles in one's

poison in the house ! Much you must think of the dear children.

it myself? I know that, but then I knew nothing of the black-

that anybody passes to see ours. Didn't Mrs. D1GBY insist on calling
their new house ‘Love-in-Idleness, though everybody knew that
that wretch D1GBY was always beating her Still, when folks read
“Rose Cottage’ on the wall, they seldom think of the lots of thorns
that are inside. In this world, Mn. CAUDLE, names are sometimes
quite as good as things.
“That cough again : You've got a cold, and you'll always be
getting one—for you’ll always be missing the omnibus as you did on
Tuesday,+and always be getting wet. No constitution can stand it,
CAUDLE. You don’t know what I felt when I heard it rain on
Tuesday, and thought you might be in it. What? I’m very good?
Yes, I trust so : I try to be so, CAUDLE. And so, dear, I’ve been
thinking that we’d better keep a chaise. You can't afford it, and you
won't & Don't tell me: I know you'd save money by it. I’ve been
reckoning what you lay out in omnibuses ; and if you’d a chaise of
your own—besides the gentility of the thing—you'd be money in
pocket. And then again, how often I could go with you to town,
and how, again, I could call for you when you liked to be a little
late at the club, dear? Now, you’re obliged to be hurried away, I
know it, when, if you'd only a carriage of your own, you could stay
and enjoy yourself. And after your work, you want enjoyment.
Of course, I can't expect you always to run home directly to me:
and I don't, CAUDLE ; and you know it.
“A nice, neat, elegant little chaise. What? You'll think of it?
There's a love 1 You are a good creature, CAUDLE ; and ’t will
make me so happy to think you don't depend upon an omnibus. A
sweet little carriage, with our arms beautifully painted on the
panels. What? Arms are rubbish; and you don't know that you hare
any ? Nonsense: to be sure you have—and if not, of course they're
to be had for money. I wonder where CHALKPIT's, the milkman's
arms came from ? I suppose you can buy 'em at the same place. He
used to drive a green cart; and now he's got a close yellow carriage,
with two large tortoise-shell cats, with their whiskers as if dipt in
cream, standing on their hind legs upon each door, with a heap of Latin
underneath. You may buy the carriage, if you please, MR. CAUDLE ;
but unless your arms are there, you won't get me to enter it. Never !
I’m not going to look less than MRs. CHALKP1t.
“Besides, if you haven't arms, I’m sure my family have, and a
wife's arms are quite as good as a husband's. I’ll write to-morrow
to dear mother, to know what we took for our family arms. What
do you say? What? A mangle in a stone-kitchen proper ? Mn. CAUDLE,
you’re always insulting my family—always: but you shall not put
me out of temper to-night. Still, if you don't like our arms, find
your own. I dare say you could have found 'em fast enough, if you'd
married Miss PRETTY MAN. Well, I will be quiet; and I won't
mention that lady's name. A nice lady she is . I wonder how much
she spends in paint | Now, don't I tell you I won't say a word more,
and yet you will kick about !
“Well, we’ll have the carriage and the family arms ? No, I don’t
want the family legs too. Don't be vulgar, MR. CAUDLE. You
might, perhaps, talk in that way before you'd money in the Bank;
but it doesn't at all become you now. The carriage and the family

though they praise their place for a little Paradise, Idare say they've

quite looks it.

much—next to nothing—to put a gold band about SAM's hat on a
Sunday. No : I don't want a full-blown livery. At least, not just
yet. I’m told the CHALKPIts dress their boy on a Sunday like a dra-
gon-fly; and I don't see why we shouldn't do what we like with our
own SAM. Nevertheless, I'll be content with a gold-band, and a bit
of pepper-and-salt. No : I shall not cry out for plush next ; certainly
not. But I will have a gold band, and—You won't ; and I know it?
Oh yes! that’s another of your crotchets, Mn. CAUDLE ; like nobody
else—you don't love liveries. I suppose when people buy their
sheets, or their table-cloths, or any other linen, they’ve a right to
mark what they like upon it, haven't they Well, then You buy
a servant, and you mark what you like upon him, and where's the
difference? None, that I can see.”
“Finally,” says CAUDLE, “I compromised for a gig : but SAM did
not wear pepper-and-salt and a gold band.”.
THE QUEEN OF SPAIN AND THE GEESE.
WE have often heard of the “royal game of goose,” but never
knew its difficult rules until now. We have learned them from the
Times' Spanish correspondent, who writes from San Sebastian,
whereat a grand fête has been given to the Queens and Infanta of
Spain. Bulls were slaughtered, horses gored, and the necks of live
geese torn from their bodies. Delicate pleasures for susceptible
minds ! We give the correspondent's account of this new royal game
of goose:—
“Between two ships a large rope hung across the sea, and in the middle was tied a
live goose, whose neck was to be wrung off by men who jumped up for this purpose
from boats which passed under the rope; and, really, seeing these men one after the
other jump from the boat and rise in the air, each holding the bird's head fast in his
hand, was not the least amusing part, could one have divested one's-self of the barbarity
of the spectacle. Then both dived under the water, and afterwards rose higher than
ever. This was sometimes repeated several times; but at last, when the man succeeded
in wringing off the goose's neck, down he went into the water, and the boat returned to
pick him up.”
This may be called a truly national game: and it has this advan-
tage over national games in general; it contains a deep meaning, a
serious lesson, if men will but learn it. The goose—so we interpret
this pretty piece of sport—is any Spaniard who may be fool enough
to hope to keep a high station in Spain by honest, honourable means:
the fellows who jump at it, are his countrymen, who would wring off
his neck, that, under the tuition of the QUEEN DowAGER, the little
QUEEN Regnant, might laugh to see such pastime. Any of our
readers who doubt the truth of our interpretation, we refer to
BALDom ERo Espant Eno, Regent's Park, the goose that was too
honest for modern Spain.

96 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SHOCKING IGNORANCE OF THE BISHOPS.
EEPLY do we regret to hear that the Ecclesiastical Commissioners are in the darkest state
of worldly ignorance. Many of the Bishops, it will hardly be believed in the nine-
teenth century, appear to be wholly destitute of the commonest knowledge of
arithmetic. The consequence is, the body is in a state of bankruptcy. What sort
of dividend may be obtained for the benefit of the poor churches, we cannot precisely
say; but, in many cases, it is believed that the sum will not exceed a farthing in the
pound. There is, however, some comfort left to the Christian mind in the con-
templation of one pleasing fact; that if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners have, in
some instances, failed to provide for the spiritual wants of the people, they have in
no case whatever neglected to build or purchase palaces for the Bishops. Thus, if
Rochester need a church or so, it must not repine at the want, seeing that
Rochester's Bishop is housed at the expense of 30,000l. 1 Again, the Bishop
of Ripon cannot be decently lodged under 16,000l.; and the Bishop of LINcolN
has required no less a sum for a roof to cover him. And then the shocking mistakes
in the matter of Bishops' salaries : We learn that the Bishop of Dun HAM, whose
income was to be cut down to the apostolic sum of 8,000l. a year, has by some
pleasing blunder received 18,000l. The Bishop of Salisbury, too, has been
involved in a like error, taking 17,000l. instead of 5,000l. Heavy complaints are
made against the Bishop or LoNDoN, who is said to have bolted the whole of the
commission—a common case, that we have before touched upon in the School of
Bad Designs—and wherever he goes, carries it about with him. Yet we can hardly
believe this, recollecting, as we do, his Lordship's late touching appeal in the City
for funds for the spiritual necessities of the destitute English. That the commission,
however, is insolvent is not to be doubted : a calamity to be of course attributed to
the all unworldly ways of the reverend members. It has been said of a humble
member of the Church, that “Ev’n his failings lean'd to virtue's side.” In like
manner, however irregular the arithmetic of the commission, it is always found to
lean to the side of the Bishops. Their commission account, it is true, is in terrible
disorder; but their own bank-books, we may rely upon it, are straightforward
enough ; clear “as proofs of Holy Writ.”
Again, it has been often disputed what makes a Church. One controversialist
says the Bishops, another the congregation. Thus, after all, in the expenditure of
between two or three millions of money the Bishops may have regulated the outlay
in a manner perfectly consistent with their orthodoxy. They had the money to
expend upon churches. Bishops are churches; ergo, the funds should be laid out
upon themselves. If they have given any portion thereof for the erection of stone
and brick edifices, the greater the virtue of the donors; seeing that they, the flesh
and blood Bishops, are the Church. There is an old story of a play-house manager,
that parallels this case.
Business had been very bad. Nothing would drag the people to the theatre. No
puff soever would do it, however “craftily qualified.” At length the player advertised that he would give the whole proceeds of a certain
night “to the poor”. The house was crammed. On the following morning the churchwardens waited on the manager to receive the
funds. “They are already applied,” said the manager, “according to the terms of my bill.” “Applied 1” cried the churchwardens.
“Applied,” repeated the manager. “I promised to give the receipts to the poor. I have taken them myself—I am the poor "
And, after this fashion, may the Bishops make their defence. “We have expended the money upon ourselves; for we, the Bishops,
are the Church.'

CONSOLATION FOR THE UNDECORATED.
At length the MARquis of LoNDoNDERRY is about to receive the
distinction long due to his combined ability and modesty. MADAME
Tussaud, that distinguished patroness of merit, has vouchsafed him || -
promotion. He is to be immediately called up to her exhibition in
wax. Hence, he will go down to posterity the very model of d
Marquis. The waxen effigy, too, will have a great advantage over
the original : for, being what folks call a speaking likeness, it will
nevertheless maintain unbroken silence, even though loungers in the
exhibition should touch upon the Marquis’s “late lamented rela-
tive,” and his peculiar claims to British gratitude. We understand
that the happy thought of adding the Marquis to the other celebrated
and notorious characters of Baker Street, arose in the mind of
MADAME Tussaud from a perusal of the account of the proroga-
tion of Parliament. “On the left below the throne”—thus ran the
passage—“stood the MARquis or LoNDoNDERRY, most superbly
dressed in military uniform, and wearing his many splendid decorations.”
Madame immediately entered into a negotiation with the Marquis's
valet, and, regardless of expense, possessed herself of the very suit
in which the Marquis wrote his celebrated application to LonD.
Liverpool for a pension on the score of diplomatic services; an
epistle that drew from the Minister those immortal monosyllables—
“This is too bad.”
MADAME T. has forwarded to us an advertisement: but our
respect for the Marquis will not permit us to print it among Mechi's
razor-strops and KINAHAN's LL whiskey: no, it would be a source
of pain to us not to exhibit it in the body of our work; and
here it is:—
MARAME TUSSAUD presents her respects to PRince Alment (her fre-
quent visitor, as a lover of high art), the Nobility, Gentry, and the veterans of
the Peninsula, and begs to state that
she has just added the MARQUIs of
LoNDoNDERRY, with all his orders, to
her collection. The orders have been
made with startling fidelity to the
originals; and such is their number,
such their lustre, that to the imagina-
tive eye the bust of the noble Marquis
will appear not very unlike the
window of a jeweller's shop, whilst
to the plebeian mind it may probably
suggest the Jack of Diamonds. The
limits of an advertisement will not
permit MADAME T. to enumerate all
the decorations. She can only name
a few. First, there is the Order of
Fraternal Love, bestowed by the late
LoRD CastleREAGH upon the Marquis,
for — being his brother. Secondly,
there is the Order of the Cooked Goose,
granted by the Commons, on their
non-acceptance of the Marquis as
Ambassador to Russia. Thirdly,
there is the Order of the Trunk-
makers, presented by the publisher
of the Marquis's History of the Pe-
ninsular War. This is in very unex.
ceptionable paste). And, fourthly,
there is the Order of the No Go,
granted by Lord Liverpool, to the
Marquis, in lieu of a pension. This
order is wrought in the very finest
Corinthian brass, and throws, indeed,
a fitting lustre on all the other decorations. Admittance, One Shilling. N.B. Penin-
sular Veterans—Sixpence.
the Jack of diamonds.
The “N.B.” does equal honour to MADAME Tussaud's head and
heart. She knows that the bold, impatient men, who have lately
clamoured in the ears of Parliament for a decoration of some sort,
cannot but receive a wholesome lesson from a contemplation of the
waxen Marquis, whose famous original so eloquently rebuked them
for “asking” for any honour soever. They will be smitten with
repentance when they behold the blaze of decorations on the Mar-
quis's breast and feel—for they must feel it—that he owes every
sparkling glory to a modesty that has endeared him to the country
at large. They will behold a man who never could ask for anything,

THE report that Westminster Bridge is to be pulled down rests, we
regret to say, upon the slightest foundation. Many people declare that
the bridge is no better than the report.

He proverb which says that misfortunes never
, come alone, has-been fearfully realised in the
jº case of the Brighton Breakwater. The first
7 thing that happened amiss, was the seizing of
the Breakwater for debt, and putting a man
into possession. This was, in fact, a case
of distress, though there were no other sig-
nals of distress but the presence of a Sheriff's
officer. The bailiff's follower was, however,
aroused in the middle of the night by a dread-
ful jar of the elements, and he found that the
fury of the storm had torn the Breakwater
from its anchor. The Sheriff, in the person
of his officer, was rapidly drifting out to sea, and there seemed every
|prospect of his being carried across the Northern Ocean, to the distant
shores of the Pacific. Nobody in Brighton thought about the Breakwater
or the man in possession, until it occurred to the debtor that he might
put out to sea in a life-boat and make a bargain. He accordingly rowed
out to the Breakwater, where he found the Sheriff's representative,
screaming wildly for assistance. After a considerable parley it was
jä. the debt should be cancelled on condition of the debtor
baling out the bailiff from the water in which he was already up to his
middle. This arrangement having been completed, the parties rowed in
|-- boat, which they had never done on any previous occasion.
TMore Gpeculation.
THE latest railway facetiousness has been the announcement of a
*RAILway AND PIER CoMPANY FoR THE Island of Jeasey.” The greatest
merit of this new line, we imagine, will be its extreme cheapness. A
railway cannot possibly cost much, when it might be conveniently packed,
termini and all, into the Exeter 'Change Arcade, and have room for a
station to spare. We have not yet seen the prospectus of this new railway,
which is only worthy of the kingdom of Lilliput; but we have been told the
capital will be 10l., in eight hundred shares of 5s. each, and that the
deposit will be three-half-pence per share. A great return is expected
from the transport of convicts; and, as the Jerseyian authorities always
make England their Botany Bay, we are sure no Englishman, who lives
on the coast of the Channel, will begrudge the Island of Jersey such a
return... We hear that the engineer of the Company brought to town a
fac-simile of the railway in his waistcoat-pocket.
THE “AGRICULTURAL MIND.”
ATELY so much has been said about the Agricultural
Mind, that the idea of analysing it has occurred
to a distinguished metaphysician; a summary of
whose views respecting it we subjoin.
The agricultural is a variety, though an odd one,
of the human inind; and, notwithstanding all that
has been insinuated to the contrary, is endowed,
to a certain extent, with Consciousness, Perception,
Conception, Imagination, Memory, and Judgment.
We shall say a little—for the less is said, perhaps,
the better—of these faculties, in order.
Consciousness.--The agricultural mind possesses
a sort of consciousness very similar to the state called a state of beer. It
is conscious, just now, of being in a predicament, though it does not know
what a predicament is. That predicament may be termed a quandary,
similar, in a measure, to that of the blind man in blind-man's-buff; for
the agricultural mind is politically quite in the dark, whilst it is jostled
about on all sides by all parties, and does not know where to turn, nor
whom to lay hold hold of. It has also an obscure consciousness of being
humbugged by SIR Robert Peel.
PERception.—What the agricultural mind perceives at all, it perceives
clearly, as that black is black, white white, and two and two make four.
It perceives pigs, oxen, sheep, and horses, when it sees them; as also
corn, hay, clover, turnips, and oats, which it terms “wuts.” In short, it
perceives just what it sees, but not what it does not see.
Conception.—The agricultural mind, by an effort, can conceive
external objects. It can conceive a plough, but it cannot conceive that
any kind of plough can be so good as the old one. It conceives chalk,
and it conceives cheese, and, in part, the difference between them ; but
it cannot conceive chalk to be carbonate of lime. However, it seems
to conceive one thing rather difficult of conception, which is, how a
labourer and his family can live upon seven shillings a week.
Imagination.—The agricultural mind possesses some imagination. It

THE GREAT DESERT OF LONDON.
HE Desert we are about to write upon is not
the sandy waste of Libya, for it would be
waste indeed of our valuable time to write
on sand, for posterity would find no trace
left, and this is what Punch could never
think of submitting to. The Desert of
London has a strange peculiarity, namely,
that it assumes the character of the Desert
only during a certain period of the year,
which is generally during the months of
August, September, and October. It is
divided, like the great African concern,
into two unequal parts—that to the West
being called the Western, or Regent Street, Desert, and that
to the East, the Great City. Desert, or the Waste of Fleet Street.
There are a few spots called Oases, like islands in the ocean, and the
stock Exchange is just now the great Oasis of the City, where the
inhabitants that still remain in the Desert of the East, may daily be
seen to congregate. It would be difficult to point out an eligible oasis
in the Desert of the West, for the Italian Opera, which offered an
asylum until the latter end of August, became by that time as dreary
a waste as the rest of the western regions.
The Caravans that traverse the Desert are omnibuses, the drivers
and conductors of which thirst in vain for a good draft-of passen-
gers. MALTE-Baus informs us that “the caravans describe a tºrtuºus
road, in order to profit by the Oases;” and in the Great London
Desert an omnibus will go roundabout ways in the vague hope of
passing some Oasis where it may be possible to pick up a passenger.
such is the awful influence of the terrible Simoom, that the cab
horse has been known to drop exhausted for want of water, like the

camels, which in the year 1805 fell victims to a dearth of that deli-
cious, but—when unmixed with alcohol—decidedly feeble element.
Running out of the Great Western Desert are numerous tracts,
including the strong pass of Pall Mall, with its great solitudes,
known as the Clubs, which form its southern boundary. Connected
by the equally sterile Strand it joins the Fleet Street Desert, from
which it is only separated by a rocky pile, called Temple Bar, giving
aduller aspect to the dismal solitude. Crossing the river by the
now unfrequented pass of Blackfriars, we again meet with a vast
sandy tract, known as Blackfriars Road, and occupying the whole
space between the dismal river, and scarcely less dismal Bedlam.
- Proceeding eastwards we come to two Oases at the foot of London
Bridge, where a wharf on one side, and a railway terminus on the
other, afford an opportunity to the wretched inhabitants to fly on
the wings of steam as far as possible from the eastern and western
Deserts of London.
The doomed individuals who are compelled to remain may be
seen wandering about in a state of listless exhaustion, while a
settled melancholy pervades every countenance, and the passenger
sinks under the fatigue of hailing a cab, and the cabman is scarcely
capable of the effort of responding to the summons.
SONG OF THE UNREPORTED BARRISTER,

That unimportant word.
From Court to Court I hurry me,
But sad is my regret;

No notice can I get.
They bid me seek at Common Law
The business others gain,
But if I even tried Chaneery
My efforts would be vain.
*Tis true that many Libehold
Who by reporting get
What I ne'er could, by pen or fee,
To my extreme regret.

Don't care for what they say,
I only know I've struggled hard

But can't ; and so gainst those who can,
I'll make the deadest set.
A REASONABLE REQUEST.
To the Poor Law Commissioners: The Humble Petition of
the Inmates of the Andover Union Workhouse.
“WHEREAs the undersigned, Your Petitioners, now under sentence of
imprisonment for their poverty in the Andoverworkhouse, have been
constrained by extreme hunger, to gnaw the bones of horses and
other-animals, which they were employed to crush, in order to
appease the same; and whereas, such bones being in a state unfit
for human consumption, your said Petitioners fear that a further
recourse to that expedient will entail on them divers diseases, and
ultimately death, a punishment which, they venture to hope, you will
esteem somewhat too grievous for their offences:
“And whereas, in divers parts of the county of Hampshire, certain
animals called swine are greatly over-fed, and thereby rendered
much fatter than any pork ought rightly to be:
“And further whereas, in the said county and elsewhere, large quantities
of potato-peelings and turnip-rinds, are daily thrown and cast away,
of which turnip-rinds and potato-peelings Your Petitioners would be
very glad:
“Your Petitioners humbly request that your Honourable Board will, in
such manner as your wisdom may direct, cause areasonable quantity
of the species of food termed grains, now and heretofore consumed
by the said swine, and also of the rinds and peelings cast away as
aforesaid, to be collected and allotted to the use of Your Petitioners,
that their bodies may be sustained by a better and less noxious kind
of offal than what they have been reduced to devour. For Your
Petitioners assure you that they would fain partake of the refuse of |
the kitchen, and of the grain which the swine aforesaid do eat.
“And Your Petitioners, as by their chaplain taught, and as in duty
bound, will ever pray, &c.”
(Here follow the marks and other signatures of the Petitioners.)

WE have just seen the last number of the Petit Courrier des Messieurs—a journal devoted to the
... embellishment of mankind in general, and Frenchmen in particular. The plate of Fashions this
month gives another proof of the pride the French take in their civilisation of Algiers. Their dress
now consists of the same articles as the savage tribes they have conquered, and they are worn so
naturally, that if it were not the grace that distinguishes the Frenchman at all times from the savage,
it would be impossible to tell the one from the other. A real tomahawk has superseded the walking-
stick, and an elegant calumet the common cigar “de régie.” But the greatest change that has taken
place in the Frenchman is decidedly in the head. The hair is richly embroidered with feathers, dyed in
a new colour, called the “nuance du sang;” and the ringlets are taken up at the back with a pretty
little bone, brought from Algiers, where the soldiers wear it as a “Sourenir de Dahra. The legs are
bandaged with a kind of rich cordage made in imitation of little twigs and faggots. We are glad to
see that Frenchmen have thrown off the cloak, and will assume henceforth the Algerian wrap-rascal.
This is made of the roughest sheepskin, smoked all over, with a new preparation of turf, sold in large
quantities under the name of “Pélissier.” In these new fashions the greatest luxury is combined
with the commonest objects, in order to show the world that a Frenchman, when he does take off a
barbarian, does it with an air that is quite beyond the reach of other nations. We hope this compli-
mentary attention to costume will have the good effect of ingratiating the Arabs with their new
conquerors, by convincing them that MARshal Bugeaud and his brave companions have not scrupled
to sink the Frenchman, in order to be identified the more closely with the worst habits of the
barbarian. .
THE ORANGE LION.

gentlemen—alive—alive 1 Listen to
the words of the showman, a MR.
HUDSON :—
“The Orange lion had risen in his might.
(Loud cheers.) He stood beside the Crown,
where he had ever stood. (Cheers.) His
roar was heard abroad (loud cheers)—his
mane was erect (loud cheers)—and Repeal,
| Popery, and Peelery, were already crouching
before him. (Loud cheers.)”
After this, we think, the British
| Lion of Exeter Hall may curl his
tail round his legs, and go to sleep
like any puppy dog. SIR EARDLEY
\ |SMITH's Lion is done for by the
Orange Lion, that has just “risen

it will be acknowledged, of wondrous
powers of action. But we have ex-
pected this all along. A wonder is
never long permitted to remain un-
rivalled. A cobbler finds a Singing
Mouse; and a fishmonger imme-
diately lights upon a Whistling

a family of dwarfs from Germany.
A vile spirit of imitation is the low,
creeping spirit of the age. If the
phoenix were caught to-morrow
morning, we should have phoenixes
advertised, common as pheasants,
at poulterers'. SIR. E. SMITH and
MR. Hudson, like rival showmen at
a fair, may each call upon the whole
world to walk up to see his peculiar
Lion ; but we fear his leonine
majesty of Orange will for the
present carry it. However, the
rival bipeds may assail each other
in the words of Bombastes Furioso,
merely changing names:—

that you would achieve repeal within six months, or else “lay your head

neither has the empire been dismembered, nor yourself decapitated.
There you go, Sir, with your head on, in defiance of all that is trust-

the facetious world, has given it as his opinion that the ice must be
poisonous, for it is openly advertised as Concentrated Wenom (Wenham).
We understand, however, that the real object of the Wenham Lake Ice
Company, and the one by which it is expected that the largest profit will
be realised, is the paving the metropolis with large blocks of the article,
which will be found almost as durable as the wood pavement, and not
quite so slippery.

sent us the dimensions. The saucer that held it was as large as one of
the basins in Trafalgar Square. The spoon was the length of a boat-oar,
and the tea-urn that filled it was about the size of a washhouse pump.
We hope this Cheltenham Tea-Cup has been preserved, as we are confident
that in a short time it will be quite as celebrated as the monster Tun at
Heidelberg. We suggest that it be christened “FATHER MATHEw.”

R. I.G HTS OF A FR EN C II PIE E R .
The wings of the press have carried the news all round the world
that Victon Hugo, Poet and Peer of France, was a short time since
criminally detected with MADAME BIARD, wife of the celebrated
French painter. Victon Hugo, with a chivalry not to be found in
his books, claimed his privilege as a peer; was loosed from the
hands of the police, and immediately set out upon his travels, leaving
poor MADAME BLARD to pay the penalty of their double offence.
The husband, a few days since, applied for a séparation de corps, which
the Civil Tribunal granted him; at the same time condemning
MADAME BIARD to be imprisoned for three months in the House of
Correction. Three months in gaol for the weaker vessel, the erring
woman—and a pleasant tour of three months in Italy or Spain for
her criminal accomplice—the Poet and Peerſ Great, indeed, is the
privilege of a Peer of France; and vast, in truth, are the beneficial
results of the French revolution. But we can, judge Victon Hugo
from his books. Yes; we know that ardent, chivalrous soul. We
feel that it will be impossible for him to enjoy liberty beneath a
summer sky, whilst the fragile partner of his sin is alone punished.
No. Immediately he knows the sentence—the instant that he reads
the paragraph in Galignani—he will order post-horses. He will
return to France. He will pray the Civil Tribunal that he may be
imprisoned also: and if—as it may be—his prayer be denied, he will
for three months become a voluntary prisoner to his house, and the
better to show his sympathy with his fellow-prisoner, let his nails
grow. This the poet will do; unless, indeed, he should take it in
his head to stay where he is; and write a volume of Réveries for an
enterprising publisher.
Anyway, we cannot but stare that the most chivalrous, the most
gallant nation under the sun–as France always modestly calls her-
self—should imprison the gentler sex for frailties which we rough
Britons never visit with the gaol. Had MADAME BIARD sinned in
London instead of Paris, she would have been as free—as Victor
Hugo himself. And then the rights of the peerage 1 We shudder

ADVICE TO ASPIRING ARTISTS.
r the Palace of Westminster a clever artist has now a
chance of a good job or two ; and we especially ad-
dress those who are
desirous of that
sort of employment.
Painting being an
imitative art, it be-
hoves every painter
to cultivate his fa-
culty of imitation.
He can do nothing
without a model, and
the best models that
he can choose are the
Germans. Accord-
ingly, let him allow his hair to grow
long, and let him also wear mustaches
and a great beard. He will likewise
do well to dress in the style of the
middle ages; or if his clothes are
not middle-aged, they should at least
be old, and the dirtier and shabbier
they are, consistently with common
decency, the better. This is that
judicious kind of imitation which, if
not tantamount to originality, is the
next thing to it, and is sure to gain
credit for it at any rate.
As to copying RAPHAEL and Michael
Angelo, he need take pattern from them
in no respect except in his personal
costume. It is now admitted that those
individuals were very poor daubers,
their style being a great deal too free
and easy, and not at all cramped,
stiff, and wooden enough for high art.

process very allowable in a caricature, but which in all grand or
serious subjects, ought to be avoided. Feet, in historical and sacred
paintings, ought to be drawn, so that one may see the whole front
of them; and with regard to hands, every figure that holds anything
should be made to grasp it, as a bishop in an old church window, or on
an ancient font, is represented clutching his crozier. Or, which comes to

the same thing, whatever the figure holds, should be held as our own
wooden representative is wont to hold his cudgel.
The old prejudice in favour of what was called the breathing canvass,
is a fallacy; an artist should not depict life but marble, and then his
pictures will be aesthetical. Neither should he, following Nature, affect a
variety of tints; let him stick to one or two, and not attempt to advance
in colouring till he has mastered form. He ought to consider Nature as
opposed to Art. Indeed he should not go to Nature at all : he had
much better go to barn-doors; for there he will be enabled to study Art in
its rudiments—the chalk sketches of infant genius.

rage English sense; but English sense is very common sense, and greatly
inferior to German nonsense—at least in the opinion of certain patrons of
the Fine Arts.

The Times, some days since, jocularly compared the learned gentlemen of the Bar, at
Westminster Hall, to the gentlemen of the Whip, on a cab-stand, where they wait for fares.
“Touting,” however, the Times said, or active exertions to get a fare, was not allowed at
the Bar; and, in so far, the Bar was more dignified than the Whip.
The Times, however, has been forced to confess its error. It hasn’t apologised to the
cabmen as yet; but it should. The Bar touts upon occasions with wonderful activity;
the gallant fellows have been at work for the last fortnight, canvassing for the vacant
Judgeships of the Courts of Request, as the following different appeals will show :—
The GenTeel, CANWASS.
“Mr. FREDERic Figtree solicits your vote and interest. His connexions with Westminster
are of long date. He was educated at Westminster School. His uncle was a Canon of West-
minster; and his grandmother, the Honour ABLE MRs. FIGTREE, occupied for thirty-eight years
a house in Great George Street.
“MR. Figtree is a member of the Western Circuit, and in the year 1822, his first circuit,
held a brief in the case of SNooks v. SNoBBY.
“He has occupied chambers on the third floor for twenty-three years, during which time he
has eaten two thousand four hundred and eleven dinners in hall; has paid nine hundred and
sixty pounds rent ; and never been in arrears to his clerk or laundress.
“MR. Figtaee flatters himself he is a gentleman by birth and education.
“He has never had any connexion with the Press, which he heartily despises, and voted for
the banishment of reporters from the Bar-mess.
“Having thus upheld the dignity of his profession during a period of nearly a quarter of a
century, MR. FIGTREE offers himself to notice as a person qualified to hold the office of Judge of
the Westminster Court of Requests.
“He has the honour of subjoining the following testimonials:-
* * FROM MR. JUSTICE HUMDRUM.
“‘My DeAR FIGTREE,--I am delighted to give any testimony I can in your favour. To my
certain knowledge you have travelled twenty thousand miles on circuit, always in a post-chaise.;
and during that period you have ever conducted
yourself as a man of honour and a gentleman.
“‘Most sincerely yours,
** Humphry HUMDRUM.”
* * FROM MR. BARON MAULEY.
“‘DEAR Fig,-Olim truncus eras ficu-
luus inutile lignum. I am glad to think you are
to be useless no longer, and that after twenty-
five years your talents are to have fair-play.
“‘Though you have not been lucky as a Barris- |
ter, I am sure you will be great as a Judge. As a
Judge of claret, for instance, I know few like you.
I wish you every success in your canvass, and
shall be glad to see you presiding in your Court,
and all the tradesmen in Westminster sitting
under their figtree. -

MANSLAUGHTER AND STEAM.
A LETTER the other day appeared in the Times,
from which it would seem that passengers at
Hungerford Pier are expected to jump into steam-
boats whilst starting, at the risk of their necks.
Within a few days afterwards, at the same place,
a poor lad had one leg wrenched off, and the
other broken in two places, through the uncon-
trolled vagaries of a certain rope. .
Among the peculiarities of steam competition,
that of regardlessness of life and limb is very
remarkable. Steam-boats in this respect seem
to vie with railways. We have heard of steam-
tugs; but surely Thugs of another sort must be
incorporated with the steam-boat and railway com-
panies. Perhaps their object would be the more
effectually promoted were some malevolent society
established for the encouragement of negligence
and the increase of accidents, by proposing prizes
and medals for the severest fractures and greatest
number of homicides, which those companies,
respectively, could furnish in the course of a
week; to be distributed to the individuals through
whose neglect or drunkenness such casualties
occurred. A suitable reward of another kind might
be provided for them by Government, if Govern-
ment would attend to any other duties than Taxes.

MRS. T CAUDLEPS CURTAIN LECTURES.
LECTURE XXXI.
MRS. CAUDLE ComPLAINS VERY BITTERLY THAT MR. CAUDLE HAS
* BROKEN HER CONFIDENCE.”
MR. CAUDLE 1 you’ll catch me telling you
anything again. Now, I don't want to have
So any noise : I don't wish you to put your-
self in a passion. All I say is this;
never again do I open my lips to you
about anybody. No : if man and wife
can't be one, why there’s an end of every-
thing. Oh, you know very well what I
mean, MR. CAUDLE: you’ve broken my
confidence in the most shameful, the most
heartless way, and I repeat it — I can
never be again to you as I have been.
No : the little charm—it wasn't much—
that remained about married life, is gone
----for ever. Yes; the bloom's quite wiped
* off the plum now.
“Don’t be such a hypocrite, CAUDLE ; don't ask me what I mean
MRs. BADGERLY has been here—more like a fiend, I'm sure, than a
quiet woman. I haven’t done trembling yet! You know the state
of my nerves, too; you know—yes, sir, I had nerves when you mar-
ried me; and I haven't just found'em out. Well, you’ve something
to answer for, I think. The BADGERLYs are going to separate; she
takes the girls, and he the boys, and all through you. How you can
lay your head upon that pillow and think of going to sleep, I can't
tell. What hare you done 2 Well, you have a face to ask the question.
Done? You’ve broken my confidence, Mn. CAUDLE : you’ve taken
advantage of my tenderness, my trust in you as a wife—the more
fool I for my pains !—and you’ve separated a happy couple for ever.
No; I'm not talking in the clouds; I’m talking in your bed, the
more my misfortune.
“Now, CAUDLE—yes, I shall sit up in the bed if I choose; I’m
not going to sleep till I have this properly explained; for MRs.
BADGERLY shan’t lay her separation at my door. You won't deny
that you were at the Club last night? No, bad as you are, CAUDLE
—and though you're my husband, I can't think you a good man; I
try to do, but I can't—bad as you are, you can't deny you were at
the Club. What? You don't deny it? That’s what I say—you
can’t. And now, answer me this question. What did you say—
before the whole world—of MR. BADGERLY's whiskers ? There's
nothing to laugh at, CAUDLE ; if you'd have seen that poor woman,
to-day, you’d have a heart of stone to laugh. What did you say of
his whiskers Didn't you tell everybody he dyed 'em : Didn't you
hold the candle up to 'em, as you said, to show the purple : To be
sure you did f Ha! people who break jokes never care about
breaking hearts. BADGERLY went home like a demon; called his
wife a false woman; vowed he'd never enter a bed again with her,
and, to show he was in earnest, slept all night upon the sofa. He
said it was the dearest secret of his life; said she had told me; and
that I had told you ; and that’s how it had come out. What do you
say ? Badgerly was right? I did tell you ? I know I did; but when
dear MRs. BADGERLY mentioned the matter to me and a few
friends, as we were all laughing at tea together, quite in a confidential
way—when she just spoke of her husband's whiskers, and how long
he was over 'em every morning—of course, poor soul she never
thought it was to be talked of in the world again. Eh! Then I had
no right to tell you of it? And that's the way I'm thanked for my
confidence. Because I don't keep a secret from you, but show you, I
may say, my naked soul, CAUDLE, that’s how I’m rewarded. Poor
MRs. BADGERLY-for all her hard words—after she went away,
I’m sure my heartquite bled for her. What do you say, MR. CAUDLE
Serves her right—she should hold her tongue? Yes; that's like your
tyranny—you'd never let a poor woman speak. Eh—what, what,
MR. CAUDLE :
“That’s a very fine speech, I dare say; and wives are very much
obliged to you, only there’s not a bit of truth in it. No, we women
don't get together, and pick our husbands to pieces, just as some-
times mischievous little girls rip up their dolls. That’s an old sen-
timent of yours, Mn. CAUDLE ; but I’m sure you’ve no occasion to
say it of me. I hear a good deal of other people's husbands,
certainly ; I can't shut my ears; I wish I could ; but I never say
---
anything about you, -and I might, and you know it—and there’s
somebody else that knows it, too. No : I sit still and say nothing;
what I have in my own bosom about you, CAUDLE, will be buried
with me. But I know what you think of wives. I heard you talk-
ing to Ma. PRETTYMAN, when you little thought I was listening,
and you didn't know much what you were saying—I heard you.
‘My dear PRETTYMAN, says you, ; when some women get talking,
they club all their husbands' faults together; just as children club
their cakes and apples, to make a common feast for the whole set.”
Eh? You don't remember it? But I do: and I remember, too, what
brandy was left, when PRETTYMAN went. 'Twould be odd if you
could remember much about it, after that.
“And now you’ve gone and separated man and wife, and I’m to
be blamed for it. You’ve not only carried misery into a family, but
broken my confidence. You’ve proved to me that henceforth I’m
not to trust you with anything, MR. CAUDLE. No : I’ll lock up
whatever Iknow in my own breast,-for now I find nobody, not even
one's own husband, is to be relied upon. From this moment, I may
look upon myself as a solitary woman. Now, it’s no use your
trying to go to sleep. What do you say : You know that? Very well.
Now, I want to ask you one question more. Eh! You want to ask me one
Very well—go on—I’m not afraid to be catechised. I never dropt
a syllable that as a wife I ought to have kept to myself—no, I’m not
at all forgetting what I’ve said—and whatever you’ve got to ask me
speak out at once. No-I don't want you to spare me; all I want
you is to speak. You will speak? Well then, do.
“What? Who told people you’d a false front tooth 2 And is that all !
Well, I'm sure—as if all the world couldn't see it. I know I did
just mention it once, but then I thought everybody knew it—
besides, I was aggravated to do it; yes, aggravated. I remember
it was that very day, 'at MRs. BADGERLY's, when husbands'
whiskers came up. Well, after we’d done with them, somebody
said something about teeth. Whereupon, Miss PRETTYMAN–a
minx 1 she was born to destroy the peace of families, I know she
was : she was there; and if I’d only known that such a creature
was no, I’m not rambling, not at all, and I’m coming to the tooth.
To be sure, this is a great deal you’ve got against me, isn't it
Well, somebody spoke about teeth, when Miss PRETTYMAN, with
one of her insulting leers, said, “she thought MR. CAUDLE had the
whitest teeth she ever had beheld.” Of course, my blood was up—
every wife's would be: and I believe I might have said, ‘Yes, they
were well enough ; but when a young lady so very much praised a
married man's teeth, she perhaps didn't know that one of the front
ones was an elephant's.' Like her impudence 1—I set her down for
the rest of the evening. But I can see the humour you’re in to-
night. You only came to bed to quarrel, and I’m not going to
indulge you. All I say is this, after the shameful mischief you've
made at the BADGERLYs', you never break my confidence again.
Never—and now you know it.” -
CAUDLE hereupon writes – “And here she seemed inclined to
sleep. Not for one moment did I think to prevent her.”
BAILABLE OFFENCES.
We should really be very glad to have some authorised list of what are
and what are not bailable offences. We find from a police report in
Wednesday's Chronicle that an individual was called upon to “find good
bail" for having forwarded a beautifully inlaid box to the ARchbishop of
CANTERBURY. If the prisoner had taken away an article of that descrip-
tion we should have understood his having become liable to punishment;
but we are not aware by what statute it is declared to be criminal to give
away valuable goods, or at least to forward them with the view of giving
them. If sending beautiful specimens of art to the palaces of great
people is an offence, we are happy to hear that it is at all events bailable.
The criminality of the act is no doubt founded on the old classical au-
thority—which by a sacrifice of metre may be altered, to suit the occasion,
into timeo pauperes et dona ferentes.
New Register Office.
In order to accommodate the gentlemen of the Bar who are in want of
good situations, it is in contemplation to open a Register Office, where
candidates may enter their names, and electors may meet with any kind
of article they may wish to take into their service. No Barrister need
apply, unless he can have at least six respectable characters. Booksellers'
certificates not admissible.

“If You PLEase, Sm, You ARE STANDING IN our Light.”
THE WICKEDNESS OF WANT.
WHEN we see ladies and gentlemen driving about in their vehicles,
fine almost as the carriage of the sun—when we see them clothed in
the richest and the best—when we know that they have their town
palaces and their country palaces—when their sumptuous banquetings
are trumpeted through the columns of the Morning Post—it is to us a
matter of surprise and sorrow that none of the offenders are made to
answer for their manifold transgressions against a multitude of their
fellow-creatures. We cannot understand why they escape the police-
court. And yet, we doubt not, so strong are the prejudices of the
world, so deep its reverence for the majesty of wealth, that were any
Christian champion to call upon them to answer for their misdoings,
he, the aforesaid champion, would be speedily consigned to the inspec-
tion of a couple of doctors, preparatory to his committal to a mad-
house. Imagine the DUKE of MANYst ARs charged before Ma. GREEN-
wooD with superfluity. Imagine a summons issued against his Grace
for that he has half-a-dozen carriages, whereas thousands of his fel-
low-men trudge bare-footed; that he has as many mansions, whereas
thousands have not a roof to cover them ; that he dines every day
in the Apollo, while multitudes of his fellow-creatures never dine
at all. Now, if Christianity be anything more than the Tales of the
Genii, such charges preferred against a rich man could not be con-
sidered so very preposterous. Surely they would not be so wide of
its spirit as many most respectable church-goers might, at the first
blush, believe. Their first astonishment a little subsided at the
extravagance of the charge, and some time granted them to consult
their Testaments, though they might still very strongly protest
against the inconvenience of such charges to the rich and well-to-do,
they could not, with any Christian face, condemn them as wholly
subversive of the principles of the religion that, in comfortable
pews, they once a week sacrifice to. “Charged and indicted for
superfluity 1” A man of monstrous wealth placed at the bar, to
answer for his manifold possessions !
Well, we will allow that a man so indicted, would create much
amazement—would attract to himself a world of sympathy. But
we contend that the spectacle of such an offender would, in the eyes
of true Christianity, be less monstrous than that of a son of ADAM,
charged with destitution . It is not an indictable offence to possess
two or three hundred feather beds, but it is a social wickedness—an
affront put upon the possessors of even one pallet—for a man to
make his couch of a door-step. A case in the Cork Eraminer—com-
mented upon by the Times—strongly illustrates this wickedness of
want. One JANE Corf EE and CoRNELIUs CoNNELL were indicted,
and tried before MR. Justice Bunton, “as vagrants having no
fixed residence or mode of living.” Well, their very looks convicted
them. The case presented no knotty point to the jury: the atrocity
of their destitution—the infamy of their having nothing, spoke for
itself—was too apparent in their haggard faces, in their “looped
wretchedness.” Whereupon the Judge directed them each to find
sureties for their good behaviour within six months, to the amount
of 5l.—that is, two sureties of 50s. each ; telling them, moreover,
that “if they did not, they would be transported for seven years "
Thus, your half-naked, houseless ADAM is a felon, by the iniquity
of his destitution. This is a beautiful world about us, teeming with
plenty in its many forms, and the man who in this Land of Promise
has neither milk nor honey, is a varlet to be chastised for his
nothingness. To be sure, if he visit the dairy of another—if he rob
the bee-hives of his neighbour, he is equally indictable for the
wickedness of his ways. A hard case this for the ragged ADAM of
the nineteenth century. Chains and slavery if he have nothing, and
if he steal from others who have too much—chains and slavery. It
is a terrible truth, and strongly indicative of the inborn badness of
want, that, let us search our statute-books centuries back, and we
shall find poverty to have been always in the wrong. Man obtains
virtue only with the goods of this world.
Nevertheless, when we read such cases as that of JANE CofFEE
and CoRNELIUS Con NELL–when we hear starving, hopeless indi-
gence “charged” with destitution,--we should like to find a com-
panion for the felon : it would give us a curious pleasure to contrast
at the Bar beggarly want with plethoric wealth; and having sworn
in a Jury—mind, a Jury possessed with Christianity as prescribed by
its Founder—we should like, when the pauper culprit, the offender
“charged with destitution,” was disposed of.-we should much like
to hear the verdict on the criminal indicted for superfluity. It is,
in faith, a startling picture to contemplate a Dives on the tread-
mill; and yet, according to our faith, he is in a much worse pre-
dicament.
“Charged with destitution.” Well, the Evil One—we are sure of
it, from the horrid contradictions we sometimes see about us—has
his Jest Book, and this is one of his bitterest pleasantries.
SER E N A D E.
We have been (exclusively) favoured with a copy of the following
graceful verses composed by Doctor PRAEToRIUs, and sung by him to the
guitar before the windows of the Royal guests at Rosenau. They show
considerable aptness in a German, and there is only one word, that of
Ritter, (knight,) which is not idiomatic English. The Doctor has been
appointed Knight of the George and Blue Boar of Coburg in consequence
of the effusion.
Sleep, softly sleep, O royal pair and be your slumbers cosy now ;
Watch round their pillows, angels fair, and give their eyes repose enow;
And summer flowers and summer air breathe soft around Schloss
Rosenau !
No jealous gates are locked and barred around the Dame and Ritter
here
Nor sentinels keep watch and ward, save wakeful stars which glitter
here
Or larks (which come relieving guard at morn,) and sing and twitter
here.
Though England is an Empire grand, and but a humble Duchy’s this;
And though the realm which you command a thousand times as much
as this :
You cannot take, in all England, a pleasant slumber such as this.
As calm as in his infancy the royal ALBERT dozes here;
Forgetting cares of royalty the Stranger QUEEN reposes here,
Though citizens and peasantry come walk amid the roses here
In Pimlico there roses blow, if true the papers write of you,
But 'tis not thus in Pimlico your people take delight of you;
Were ever English people so allowed to take a sight of you ?
Then softly sleep, 0 royal pair, and pleasantly repose ye now,
In England there is state and care, and weariness and woes enow ;
But summer wind and summer air breathe gently round Schloss Rosenau.

A PATENT has been taken out by a member of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, for a new invention to be used by
equestrians on the wood pavement. It consists of a very ingenious
cradle into which the horse is placed, and which moves upon castors.
Strong bandages are thrown across its back, and fastened to the instru:
ment on both sides, so that it is impossible for the most broken-kneed
Patent Safety cab-horse to fall on the wood pavement, even after a
shower of rain or a watering-cart, when held up by this new invention.
It is called the Hippo-crutch, and is calculated to knock up the Glaciarium
that has been established for the use of horses, and the profit of
veterinary surgeons, who have made very handsome incomes out of the
casualties on the wood pavement in London.
THE WEATHER AND THE CROPS.
WE are happy to say that the look of the crops does not justify the
wretched portraits that have been given of the harvest. The picture of
the corn painted in water colours is a gross exaggeration, and the little
anecdotes of distressed wheat are mixed up with a great deal of what
may be termed chaff on the part of the reporters. We have ourselves
been through the barley districts, and can congratulate the lovers of
barley-water on the generally healthy appearance of the grain that is
destined to supply them with their favourite beverage. The peas have
not suffered much, the strength of their pea-coats having protected them
from the rain; but we are sorry to say that the potatoes have been soaked
by the frequent showers having penetrated through their jackets. The
reports that have been spread about the failure of the crops originate
chiefly in selfish motives, and a desire to raise the price of grain ; for
directly it is said that the corn is beaten down in the field, it is sure to get
up in the market.
Scoteh Liberality.
Inver NESs has lately, with the utmost generosity, presented the Sons of
BURNs with the freedom of the City. The freedom was enclosed in a deal
box, and written out on one piece of parchment, to save the expense of
copying. The possession of this freedom will enable the gallant Colonel
and his Brother, the Major, to drive a cart through the City of Inverness
without paying turnpikes, provided they have their names at full length
painted on a conspicuous part of the vehicle.
PUNCH'S REPORT ON A RECENT RAILWAY
ACCIDENT.
(AFTER GENERAL PASLEY.)
THE great merit of GENERAL PAs. EY's reports appears to consist
in their being so very scientific that unlearned people can make
neither head nor tail of them. We are not among those unreason-
able persons who seem to think that GENERAL PASLEY has no right
to go in safety along any line that he inspects; nor do we join
in holding him responsible for any accident that occurs on a Railway,
because he was not cut to pieces or blown to atoms when travelling
over it. Nevertheless, we think his reports are not a bit better than
we could do them ourselves, and we beg leave to offer the following
as a specimen :-
Punch A LA Pasley.
On examining that part of the line where the accident occurred, a
spheroid inclination, with a rectangular bend in the outer rail, was
perceptible. It might have happened that one of the flanges of the
wheels in describing a rhomboid on the base of the centre of gravity
had come into collision with the square root of the axle-tree of the
tender, leaving only two cubic inches for the passage of the air into
the cylinder, and thus caused the accident. It is a well-known fact
in physics, that two solids coming into a state of cohesion with each
other, will leave no room between, and the pressure upon the bone
of a man's leg would be at least one in nine, which would account
for the fracture of the limb of one of the passengers.
All the tunnelling seemed to be in good order, but as the mean
speed of thirty-five miles an hour under the earth's surface is unfa-
vourable to a minute inspection, it would be imprudent to speak with
too much certainty on this part of the question. As to the width of
gauge, it is clear that twos into five are two and one over, and this
leaves the inference perfectly obvious. At all events, a common
piston, acting in an ordinary valve, and revolving spherically round
a condensing cylinder, could not be less safe on the broad gauge
than on the narrow.
The carbonic acid gas sent off by evaporation from the coal might
stupify the guard, but it might not, which is on the whole the better
opinion. By stationing a guard at the mean inclination of the chief
gradient nothing would begained, nor would the accident have been
prevented had this plan been resorted to. Perhaps, in future, it
might be as well to keep a better look-out, unless the look-out kept
at present is the best that can be had ; in which case improvement
would be difficult. A thermometer on the boiler would do no harm,
but it could not be useful. Nevertheless, the effect might be tried,
as anything would be better than the continuance of accident.

rew version of God save the Queen.
The Coburg children sang our national melody in presence of their
Majesties with great sweetness and precision. It is not generally known
that Doctor PREToRIUs, who invariably accompanies his Royal patrons,
was present at the rehearsals of the poem, and instructed the little
darlings personally.
When the occasion came for singing it, one little rogue (son of PRO-
fesson Won MUFF) piped out—
“Send her victorious,
Happy and glorious,

At which the royal revellers laughed with much good humour.
ANOTHER ALTERATION IN THE TARIFF.
We understand that one of the earliest measures to be carried next
session will be a reduction of the duty of the Herne Bay policeman. He
will then be able to lead a life of lettered indolence.

A TRIUMPHAL arch, erected in honour of the QUEENs of SPAIN, was blown

A N U. N. R. EPO R T E D T R IU M P H.
The last night of the Opera was a new era in the distribution of
theatrical favours. The Prima Donna has generally monopolised the
evening’s “blaze of triumph,” or else the Première Danseuse has always
received the nosegays and wreaths. But on the night we mention a
humble individual, who has quietly worked his way to the foot-lights in
public estimation, obtained a share of the rewards the white kids of the
Opera delight in showering upon their favourites. The individual in
Question has not been in the habit of singing, or joining in any opera,
beyond coming on occasionally, and j; taking away a chair or a
table ; nor has a ballet as yet been composed for him. His name has
never appeared in red letters in the bill, and yet he is as well known at
the Opera as the big chandelier; for there never was a performance at
that theatre without him. His reputation is such, that he always comes
before the curtain at the end of the performance to receive the plaudits of
the audience ; and on the last night of the season a pleasing proof was
given by the subscribers of the very high esteem in which they hold his
talents. He had no sooner appeared to execute his usual pas seul between
the opera and the ballet, than he was received by a perfect simoom of
bouquets. . In his consternation he dropped his watering-pot, which
generally forms part of the popular character he plays, and rushed off the
stage in a speechless state of excitement. He was succeeded by a “green-
coat, man,” of a hardier nature, who was proceeding to lay the dust
for him, when, to his consternation, he found it already watered. The
. was completely deluged by the tears his agitated companion had
8Iled.
This trait of gratitude was so warmly appreciated by the sensitive
Peanor, that he has determined to compose a little divertissement for the
green-coat man next season, in which he shall execute for the future, in
: character of St. Swithin, the aqueous part he is always cast at the
pera.
Miraculous Escape.
A GENTLEMAN of property stood up, whilst it was raining last week,

minutes. He was allowed to depart without being compelled to become a

his hand preserved him.
THE CAUSE OF THE LATE BAD WEAther.
M. ARAgo has discovered that the inclemency of the weather in Paris
is occasioned by certain blocks of ice floating about in the Atlantic. From
this we may infer that the cold weather which we have lately experienced
has arisen from the large quantities of Wenham Lake Ice which are daily
carried about the streets of London.

Newfoundland, dates a printed letter from a chop-house in Piccadilly,
where he happened to be putting ºi..." having heard that there was
a better thing than the Newfoundland Judgeship to be had in the
neighbourhood, he determined to “go in for it.” This new-found office
seems to have tickled the appetite of the Newfoundland Judge, who

As these things are the legitimate objects of solicitation from gentlemen
of the bar, who are ready to pick them up on their passage from place to

the chief hotel, and hold with the waiter such a dialogue as the following:

Por, ITICAL RAILWAY ACCIDENT.
º -
-Nººs
Sºº.
---
We regret to have to record an accident which happened to one Peel,
the driver of the engine “Expediency,” belonging to the express train on
the government line of railway. It is well known that this line is exceed-
ingly crooked, and the ins and outs have always been considered very
dangerous. PEEL, who is a reckless fellow, and who has lost his place
once or twice for improper conduct, put the engine at full speed, though
it had got an enormous weight to pull against in the shape of an article
for Maynooth, which was very awkwardly placed, and if it had fallen
down must inevitably have crushed him.
Regardless of consequences, he urged the engine on ; and if it had not
happened to be “Expediency,” which he is in the habit of driving, the result
would probably have been fatal. It was however by keeping up the speed
that he succeeded in keeping clear of the dead-weight at his back ; and
there being fortunately nothing in his way to cause a collision, he arrived
in safety at the end of his journey.
I N S O L V E N T DE B TO RSP
CASE OF MRS. CHURCH.
YEstERDAY, Mas. CHURCH – familiarly known to many as
MoTHER CHURCH-applied for bail at this Court. Great interest
was excited by the case; and the Court was thronged. Among the
Bishops who were present, and who appeared to feel acutely the
condition of the Insolvent, quite as much as if it was their own, we
noticed the Bishops of LoNDoN, Roch EstER, and RIPon. MR.
CookE appeared for the insolvent, and MR. THomAs for the opposing
creditor, one John BULL :-
The Insolvent—although appearing under what may be conceived
the most humiliating circumstances—was handsomely dressed in the
very richest purple and the very finest linen. Neither could she say,
“silver and gold have I none;” being, indeed, ornamented from
head to foot with the precious metals. Her appearance, too, bespoke
C O U R T.
one who looked benignly on the fat of the land. There was a soft,
contented, sleepiness about the old lady's eye; a ruddy pulpiness of
lip ; and her cheeks glowed like a September peach. When she
spoke—and she would often interpose certain sentences, such as,
“the wicked, in his pride, doth persecute the poor;” “the meek
shall eat, and be satisfied ; ” “let integrity and uprightness preserve
me,”—the words seemed to flow from the old lady like melted
butter. The Bishop of LoNDoN was frequently observed to throw
a sympathising glance upon the insolvent, and now and then—with
his hands in his pockets—appeared to be buried either in meditation,
or calculation (for our reporter will not be positive).
MR. CookE said he appeared for the Insolvent, and (of course) in the
whole experience of his professional life, had never so keenly felt the
responsibility of his duty. The Insolvent, MRs. CHURCH, was known
to the worthy Commissioner and every respectable person present in
that Court, as a most virtuous and discreet old lady—a gentlewoman
who, wherever she lived—and he would not deny that she had many
residences, town and country—was an example of purity, and chastity,
and benevolence, to all around. The poor and hungry who thronged
her gates, and went away relieved and strengthened, would never be
known to that Court. No ; her benevolence was like the refreshing
lymph that entered all their houses. There it was, to cool the lip
and assuage the thirst of him who sought it; but the means which
sent it there were out of sight—the pipes were buried from the eye
of man, deep under ground. And thus was the charity of Moth ER
CHURCH-for he would use the more endearing epithet—laid on in the
dwellings of the poor. . (Here the insolvent, becoming affected, wiped
her eyes with a lawn handkerchief trimmed with lace, which a lady
near our reporter pronounced to be worth at least ten guineas a yard.)
Well, he now came to the immediate cause that had placed MoTHER
CHURCH in her present painful position. The truth was, wide and
deep as was her pocket, her heart was wider and deeper still. It
was true that of late she had received certain sums of money—some-
thing between two and three millions. Now, in the ordinary concerns
of life, two or three millions were a large amount. He (the learned
gentleman) would not take it upon himself to say that to a humble
individual like himself a single million would not be a sum demand-
ing his especial interest; yet it was a strange fact—a fact oddly
enough disregarded by Rican Do, M’Culloch, and every other mone-
tary philosopher—that money always sank in value, directly it was
applied to the purposes of MoTHER CHURCH. Let him not be mis-
understood. What he wished to say was this. It was well known
that many Bishops—faithful and loving sons of the Insolvent—
received ten, twelve, fourteen thousand a year (for he would keep on
the safe side, and would not exaggerate). Well, it was plain that
such sums became reduced to at least one twentieth part of their
value when dropt into the pocket of a Bishop; that what would
house and keep the laity in highest luxury, merely sufficed to supply
the decencies of existence to the sons of the Church : for once a
week, at least, they preach against pomp and all the sins of the flesh;
and is it likely that they would do this, unless, great as might appear
their revenues to the “ignorant laity,” they were as nothing when
applied to what he (the learned counsel) would venture to call
Church purposes? In his ardent youth–ere the roseate visions of
romance had been shut out by the stern truthfulness of that Court—
he had read an Eastern story; in which he read of one who was
suddenly possessed, as he thought, of a large heap of gold; and lo!
in the morning, all the glittering coin was changed to withered
leaves. Some such strange, debasing transmutation appeared to fall
upon all moneys granted, for the very best of uses, to Moth ER
CHURCH : they all seemed to be turned to leaves——but whether or
not to the leaves of the Prayer Book, he would not say.
In conclusion, the learned gentleman asked for the kindest con-
struction of the Court. His client was all unversed in the ways of
this coarse, calculating, double-entry sort of world. Her rule of
\three was not the rule of three acknowledged in the city. It was
true, she was in debt—yes, with a choking throat he would speak it
—she was an insolvent. But she had—especially in her early youth
—never been used to keeping accounts; and she had fallen into her
present plight from a most beatific state of charity—namely, that
her left hand never knew what her right was doing.
The learned gentleman sat down, melted in his own feelings, and
amidst a melodious murmur of applause. Many ladies, old and
young, whose faces are familiar to the beadle of Exeter Hall, were
affected even to hartshorn.
MR. THoMAs said he was instructed by MR. John BULL to oppose
the application. His learned brother had made a most eloquent
address, from which it would appear that the Insolvent had fallen
into her present difficulties from her extreme simplicity of mind–
from her all unworldly ways. He (Ma. Thomas) would call the
attention of the learned Commissioner to the appearance of the
Insolvent at that moment. Did she appear a person who cared
nothing for the outside look of this world? Would the Commissioner
look at her purple—would he cast his eye upon her lawn, so fine
that it seemed woven from the locks of angels? Would he also-
indeed, so massive, so glittering were they, he could not help it-
would he also take note of the gold, the gold not from Ophir, that
decorated her 1 More : he would ask of the learned Commissioner
to step outside that Court, and look at the splendid carriage in which
the Insolvent had come down to Portugal Street: to consider well the
silver harness, the satin-skinned horses—for they were not asses
from Jerusalem; and more, the coachman and footmen in purple
and powder. He would ask the Commissioner to consider all these
things, and then say whether the Insolvent, with such luxuries about
her, ought to have appeared in her present place, to pray the indul-
gence of that Court And (said the learned gentleman) he must
|oppose bail upon acts of extravagance which, if needful, he could

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
prove on vică voce testimony. He would not charge the Insolvent
with embezzlement: no, he would not quite do that. But he would
show that she had, in the most flagrant manner, misapplied the
funds placed in trust at her disposal for far other purposes. He
would show that she had received moneys in order to build places of
immortal comfort for the poor, and that—they might call it maternal
weakness if they would—she had laid out such moneys in the pur-
chasing, not of houses—oh no, houses would not satisfy her, but
palaces—for her children. He could prove what she had done for
one of her sons.
She had laid out 30,000l. on a palace for Rochest ER—“the beams
of his house were cedar, and his rafters were fir.” And he (the
learned counsel) would again ask if such a person was entitled to
the indulgence of that Court. What I they remanded miserable
mechanics—untaught, wretched men, for reckless expenditure—and
would they wink at the unparalleled, the unchristian extravagance
of the Insolvent? He (the counsel) would now call the attention of
the Commissioner to one important fact. He would go back to the
origin, the early life of Moth ER CHURCH, and would prove that her
babyhood, ay, her youth, was passed in privation; that her greatest
comfort, her truest pride—if, indeed, in those days she could feel
pride at anything—was to cast down the outside fashions of the
world—to stand, as it were, tiptoe upon earth, her hand reaching
towards heaven. In those days, she went forth in sweet simplicity,
like REBEccA to the well—and did not, like the Insolvent before
them, keep red-nosed butlers. -
In conclusion, the learned gentleman, on the part of his client,
John BULL, begged that bail might not be granted.
The learned Commissioner said this was a bad case—a very bad
case: nevertheless he would not refuse bail. When the Insolvent
came up to pass her examination, the learned counsel would then
have a further opportunity of opposing her.
Mrs. CHURCH then left the Court; and, as our reporter under-
stood, went off in the Bishop of LoNDon's carriage, that her nerves
might be properly attuned amid the groves of Fulham.
THE CONTESTED BEADLEDOM.
His election, which has kept a whole suburb in a
state of fermentation for months, threatening to
burst the very district in which it was bottled up,
came off at the appointed spot on the day that had
been agreed upon. As the candidates came to the
hustings, they were greeted with the cheers of one
party and the cabbage-leaves of the other. PUM-
MELL, who wore the crimson collar of Modesty and
the golden hat-band of the ancient order of Merry
Flunkies, looked remarkably well; but a flush of
the nose, and a quivering of the eye-lash, told what
was going on beneath. The second candidate
advanced with a rapid step, and, bowing ceremoni.
ously to the crowd, retired as it was supposed from
the contest, but in fact only to refresh at the tap of
the MARQUIs of GRANBy, said to have been painted, by Hogarth for a
small score which he had run up with the landlord, an
honest fellow, who could brew a better cup of sack
than any wineherd in Kensington.
The polling having commenced, each candidate con-
tinued addressing every elector that came up to vote ;
and PUMMELL's homely expression of “Give us your
support, old fellow,” went home to the hearts of many
who were only disgusted by what they called the
formal palaver of the opposition candidate. As the
time for the official declaration of the poll approached,
the excitement became terrible, and PUMMELL several
times fainted away with agitation, while his opponent only sustained him-
self by frequent visits to the tap of the MARQUIs of GRANBy. At length
the result of the election was announced to be an equality of votes for
both parties, when, having consulted with their friends, the candidates
tossed up, and PUMMELL having sung out tails, to which the populace
responded with a loud shout of “tails it is,” he was declared duly elected.
NEW LINE OF BUSINESS.
We understand that medical students, instead of walking the hospitals,
intend to apply for permission to walk the different railways, as, from the
number of accidents that occur on each line, they expect to finish their
surgical education in one-half of the usual period.

themselves scarce. Noiseless are the pavements; save with the tramp
of the policeman, and the tread of the occasional and peripatetic passenger.
Desertion hath darkened the Clubs of Pall Mall : desolation is paramount
in the Places of Pimlico.
RAILWAY UNIONS.
As much fraud is said to have been carried on by the amalgamation of
projected Railways, we beg leave to suggest that the fact of such junctions
being contemplated should be published, to give an opportunity to
interested parties for protesting against the intended union. The form
might be something similar to a publication of the banns of marriage, and
instead of being asked in change, the railways might be asked at the Royal
Exchange, or any other convenient locality. It would then be competent
for any party to forbid the banns, and prevent the union until inquiries
could be made as to its being suitable. An incompatibility of station
might be a good ground of objection, and the high position of one would
also be a reason for preventing its union with another on a very low level.
The same principle might be applied to proposed Railways between dif-
ferent places, calculated to form unions that can be productive of no good
to either party. If, for instance, it had been asked if any one knew any
just cause or impediment why Kensington Canal should not be joined to
Wormwood Scrubs, it would have saved a great deal of trouble to both
parties. As it is, they have been living quite apart; for want of means
has prevented that communication between them, which was the alleged
object of their union. If the London and Birmingham had not taken pity
on the unfortunate couple, got them out of their difficulties, and taken
them into its employ, we really do not know what would have become of
them.
IlliberALITY ON BOTH SIDEs.
The wind has been playing MAG's diversions with the tiles of the

We have been favoured with the following list of Railways which will
be brought before Parliament early next session:-
A Railway from the Stock Exchange to the Bethlem Hospital, with a
branch to Newgate, and another to the Queen's Bench. The shares are
already at a very heavy premium, having been principally bought up by
large speculators at Leeds. The Chairman is the late projector of the
Diddlesex Insurance Company.
A Railway from Covent Garden Theatre to Portugal-street, with
branches to the Strand, Olympic, and other minortheatres. MR. CHARLEs
Kean and MR. WANDENHoff have taken a number of shares in this
Railway, which is now known familiarly as the tragedian’s line.
Branch Railways from the different termini of the principal Railwaysin;
London to the largest metropolitan hospitals will be opened as soon as
sufficient accommodation can be made in the latter for the great access of
business this contemplated junction is sure to bring.
Prospectuses of Railways from the Punch Office to the Bank of Eng-
land—from the Dramatic Author's Society to the French Plays—from
the Ecclesiastical Commission Office to the Bankruptcy Court—from the
Conciliation Hall to the Groves of Blarney, and various others, will be
published in a few days. Investment of capital to any amount may be
considered perfectly safe in any of these new lines, as from the intimate
connexion that has long existed between the respective localities of each,
the weekly traffic in passengers and property must be immense.
WHATA BARRISTER MAY DO; AND WHAT HE MAY
NOT DO.
The RE seems to be at present a very considerable difference of opinion
among the Gentlemen of the Bar as to what may or may not be done by
a Barrister.
etiqueſte for the exclusive use of the gentlemen of the long robe; but as
what is etiquette to-day may not be etiquette to-morrow, we feared the
work would not possess the permanent utility which alone would recom-º:
pense us for the labour of writing it. We have however drawn up a
few general rules founded on our own observation as to what a Barrister
may do, and what he may not do, consistently with his professional
dignity:-
1st. A Barrister maybe employed in inducing Members of Parliament
to vote in favour of railway bills; but he may not report for a newspaper.
2nd. A Barrister may practise the “artful dodge” for the purpose of
defeating the ends of justice; but he must not enter an assize town in an
omnibus.
3rd. A Barrister may tout for a small judgeship; but he will be very
lº disbarred if he advertises his readiness to plead the cause of
clients.
4th. A Barrister may libel a rival candidate for an office in a “private
and confidential” circular; but he must not degrade himself by asking an
attorney to dine with him on the circuit.
5th. A Barrister may take a fee when he knows he cannot attend to
the cause; but he may not return the money, for his doing so would be
very unprofessional.
6th, and lasty. A Barrister may be a very honourable man; but
many, things which professional etiquette allows him to do, would be
thought disgraceful and dishonest among ordinary people.
The atmospheric Railway.
An experiment was attempted the other day, on the Herne Bay Pier
Railway line, which runs from the clock tower at one end of the jetty to
the flag-staff at the other. The object was to try the effect of the atmo-
spheric principle on the truck used for carrying the luggage, and a sail
having been stuck up among the three portmanteaus and four carpet-bags
taken out of the steamer, the truck sailed triumphantly down the jetty
upon the iron lines, amid the shout of a bystander.
RECEIPT for BREAKING stones.
SELECT the thickest and strongest box you can find, and be sure to see
that it is free from all defects. Then take the stones, which pack, as care-
fully as possible, in hay or straw. Write “Glass—with care,” and sundry
ºther such admonitions, on several parts of the box, in large letters.
Then give it to one of the appointed men at a railway station, and desire
him to take particular care of it. If you do this, and send your box fifty
miles on the railroad, you may be certain that the stones will be
Macadamized. -

ND did you not hear of a jolly young Barrister,
At the Old Bailey who used for to ply?
He made out his case with such skill and
dexterity,
Twisting each fact, while he glozed o'er each lie.
He stuck at nothing; and that so steadily,
The felons all sought his aid so readily,
And he saved from conviction so many a thief,
That this Barrister ne'er was in want of a brief.
What sights of fine rogues he got off by his
blarney; - -
Histongue was so glib, and so specious withal :
He was always retained by the great City forgers
To Newgate from Mansion House sent, or Guildhall.
And often the Press would be gibing and jeering,
But 'twas all one to him, its carping and sneering;
He’d swear black was white in behalf of a thief,
So this Barrister ne'er was in want of a brief.
And yet, only think what strange morals have lawyers,
The Bar of such conduct think nothing at all;
Whilst should any poor Counsel report for a paper,
“To Coventry with him tº that instant they call;
From their mess they'll expel him, he’ll find...to his sorrow ;
But they'll dine with the housebreaker's hireling to-morrow;

An individual who advertises that he is going out of town, states his

OYSTERS IN YOUR LOWN BASINS.
33ruspertug,
addressed to Every oystem's FRIEND.
The Sun announces a letter from M. CARBONEL to the Academy of
Sciences, stating that he has discovered the means of producing Oysters in
fresh water ponds and basins; and some publicans in the City, friends to
the Englishman and the Native, have entered into a correspondence with
that eminent man of science, determined on establishing the great
oyster-Red-in-your-own-Basin Company.
Sec. pro, temp., GeoRGE DANDo, Esq., Basinall Street.
The advantages of this Company will be manifest. The FEast of
shells is now within the reach of the poor. Every man who uses a basin
may draw from it, not only cleanliness, but a delicious feast of molluscous
enjoyment. Very young persons of both sexes have hitherto objected to
- - -
their weekly toilet, when it places at the same time within their reach º
splendid and nutritious supper : -
The great benefit derived from pearls in oysters is well known.
Parties may hope to realise a vast income from this delightful source. …
Science and ingenuity are busy in contriving a thousand ways of facili-
tating the communication between the oystER AND MANKIND. The
former being sowed in a tin dish and fed with bran, will, by warming,
instantly produce the most admirable scolloped oysters. Ready-made
oyster patties will be constructed in smaller vessels. A tureen prepared |
with the spawn over-night will yield a savoury oyster soup, so much appre-

with occasional hemorrhage from the safety-valve. The Grampus has got
something the matter with its inside, and the Scourge has been suffering
under a sort of elephantiasis, which has led to such extreme lowness and
depression, that it was feared she would have sunk altogether. The Janºs

MRS. CAUDLE'S CURTAIN LECTURES.
LECTURE XXXII.
MRS. CAUDLE DISCOURSES ON MAIDS-OF-ALL-WORK AND MAIDS IN
GENERAL. M.R. CAUDLE’s “INFAMOUS BEHAVIOUR” TEN YEARS
AGO.
HERE now, it isn’t my inten-
tion to say a word to-night,
MR. CAUDLE. No ; I want
to go to sleep, if I can ;
for, after what I’ve gone
through to-day, and with
the head-ache I’ve got,
and if I haven't left
my smelling-salts on the
mantel-piece, on the right-
hand corner just as you
go into the room—nobody
- - could miss it—I say, no-
body could miss it—in a little green bottle, and well, there you lie
like a stone, and I might perish and you wouldn't move. Oh, my
poor head | But it may open and shut, and what do you care :
“Yes, that’s like your feeling, just. I want my salts, and you tell
me there’s nothing like being still for a head-ache. Indeed But
I’m not going to be still ; so don't you think it. That’s just how a
woman’s put upon. But I know your aggravation—I know your
art. You think to keep me quiet about that minx K1TTY,+your
favourite, sir! . Upon my life, I'm not to discharge my own servant
without—but she shall go. If I had to do all the work myself, she
shouldn't stop under my roof. I can see how she looks down upon
me. I can see a great deal, Mn. CAUDLE, that I never choose to
open my lips about—but I can't shut my eyes. Perhaps it would
have been better for my peace of mind if I always could. Don't say
that. I’m not a foolish woman, and I know very well what I’m
saying. I suppose you think I forget that REBEccA I know it’s ten
years ago that she lived with us—but what’s that to do with it?
Things arn’t the less true for being old, I suppose. No ; and your
conduct, Mn. CAUDLE, at that time—if it was a hundred years ago
—I should never forget. What? I shall always be the same silly woman
I hope I shall-I trust I shall always have my eyes about me in my
own house. Now, don't think of going to sleep, CAUDLE ; because,
as you’ve brought this up about that REBEccA, you shall hear me
out. Well, I do wonder that you can name her Eh You didn't
name her? That’s nothing at all to do with it; for I know just as
well what you think, as if you did. I suppose you’ll say that you
didn't drink a glass of wine to her? Never? So you said at the time,
but I’ve thought of it for ten long years, and the more I’ve thought,
the surer I am of it. And at that very time—if you please to recol-
lect—at that very time little JAck was a baby. I should n’t have so
much cared but for that; but he was hardly running alone, when you
nodded and drank a glass of wine to that creature. No ; I’m not
mad, and I’m not dreaming. I saw how you did it, and the hypo-
crisy made it worse and worse. I saw you when the creature was
just behind my chair, you took up a glass of wine, and saying to me,
‘MAnganet, and then lifting up your eyes at the bold minx, and
saying, “my dear, as if you wanted me to believe that you spoke
only to me, when I could see you laugh at her behind me. And at
that time little Jack wasn't on his feet. What do you say? Hearen
Jorgive me? Ha! MR. CAUDLE, it’s you who ought to ask for that :
I’m safe enough, I am : it’s you who should ask to be forgiven.
“No, I wouldn't slander a saint—and I didn't take away the girl's
character for nothing. I know she brought an action for what I
said; and I know you had to pay damages for what you call my
tongue-I well remember all that. And serve you right: if you
hadn't laughed at her, it wouldn't have happened. But if you will
make free with such people, of course you’re sure to suffer for it.
'Twould have served you right if the lawyer's bill had been double.
Damages, indeed 1 Not that anybody's tongue could have damaged
her I -
“And now, MR. CAUDLE, you’re the same man you were ten years
ago. What? You hope so 2 The more shame for you. At your
time of life, with all your children growing up about you, to—What
am I talking of 2 I know very well; and so would you, if you had
any conscience, which you haven’t. When I say I shall discharge
Kitty, you say she's a very good servant, and I shan’t get a better.
But I know why you think her good; you think her pretty, and
that's enough for you ; as if girls who work for their bread have any
business to be pretty, Hwhich she isn't. Pretty servants, indeedſ
going mincing about with their fal-lal faces, as if even the flies would
spoil 'em. . But I know what a bad man you are—now, it's no use
your denying it; for didn't I overhear you talking to Mr. PRETTY-
MAN, and didn't you say that you couldn't bear to have ugly servants
about, you ... I ask you;-didn't you say that Perhaps you did?
You don't blush to confess it ! If your principles, Mn. CAUDLE,
ar'n't enough to make a woman's blood run coldi
“Oh, yes! you’ve talked that stuff again and again; and once I
might have believed it; but I know a little more of you now. You
like to see pretty servants, just as you like to see pretty statues, and
pretty pictures, and pretty flowers, and anything in Nature that’s
pretty, just, as you say, for the eye to feed upon. Yes; I know your
eyes, -yery well. I know what they were ten years ago; for shall
I ever forget that glass of wine when little Jack was in arms t I
don't care if it was a thousand years ago, it's as fresh as yesterday,
and I never will cease to talk of it. When you know me, how can
you ask it?
“And now you insist upon keeping KITTY, when there's no
having a bit of crockery for her That girl would break the Bank
of England—I know she would, if she was to put her hand upon it.
But what's a whole set of blue china to her beautiful blue eyes I
know that's what you mean, though you don't say it.
“Oh, you needn't lie groaning there, for you don't think I shall ever
forget Rebecca. ... Yes, it's very well for you to swear at REbecca
now, but you didn't swear at her then, MR. CAUDLE, I know.
‘MARGARET, my dear!’ Well, how you can have the face to look
at me—You don't look at me? The more shame for you.
“I can only say, that either Kitty leaves the house, or I do.
Which is it to be, MR. CAUDLE Eh! You don't care Both But
you're not going to get rid of me in that manner, I can tell you.
But for that trollop—now, you may swear and rave as you like—
You don't intend to say a word more?—Very well; it's no matter what
you say-her quarter's up on Tuesday, and go she shall. A soup-
plate and a basin went yesterday.
“A soup-plate and a basin, and when I’ve the head-ache as I have,
MR. CAUDLE, tearing me to pieces ! But I shall never be well in this
world—never. A soup-plate and a basin l’”
“She slept,” writes Cauple, “and poor Kitty left on Tuesday.”

“Being desirous of getting some railway shares allotted to me
in different names, and feeling it necessary to assume disguises that I

every dose I took made quite another man of me.

" Blockade of the streets.
A GREAT deal has been said about the glorious three days of the
barricades at Paris, but what ought to be said about the three weeks of
barricading to which the principal thoroughfares of London have been
already subjected The pass of Fleet Street is stopped; the great hill of
Holborn is blocked up, and Piccadilly has fallen into the hands of the
paviers, who hold possession of it with an obstimacy that would do
honour to a better cause. As to NAPoleon's achievement in forcing a
passage over the Alps, it was an easy process compared with the
difficulty which he would have found in carrying his cohorts over
Holborn Hill, or leading his legions along Fleet Street.
We cannot understand the policy of keeping the great London
thoroughfares continually blockaded, unless it be to harass an invading
enemy; for, supposing Joinville and his party to arrive in the metropolis
by the Dover Railway, they would naturally make for the Regent Circus,
and being hemmed in by wheelbarrows in front, they might be surprised
in the rear by a regiment turning suddenly round the corner of Jermyn
Street. This precaution is all very well as far as a foreign foe is con-
cerned, but it is very inconvenient to a native omnibus and its cargo of
British passengers, who are carried considerably out of their way by the
main thoroughfares being rendered impassable.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
or AN, the indefinite article, which is exceedingly use-
ful in the language of politics. Thus, an election can-
;\ didate, pledging himself to a plan of Reform, or an
- extension of the suffrage, leaves himself, by the inde-
finiteness of the article, at liberty to act as he thinks
*) proper. A in politics, like the A in Greek, often has
s] the force of a negative; as, when a statesman promises
to bring in A Bill to remedy an evil, he frequently
brings in no bill whatever.
* ABBEY, formerly a religious community, but now an
exhibition or show, to which the public may be admitted
at various prices, and, in some cases, for the small charge of three
pence. Since the Reformation, abbeys have become scarce, and their
rarity causing them to be considered as luxuries, they have been
paid for accordingly. The speculators in Westminster Abbey have
liberally reduced the prices of their exhibition; but visitors are
hurried over it at a rapid rate, in order that quick returns may be
an equivalent for small profits.
ABBREv1ATIon, the art of shortening; an art which seems
to be unknown to long-winded speakers in Parliament. An M.P.
is, however, often found abbreviating or cutting short a voter who
comes to ask a favour soon after one election, and before there is any
immediate chance of another.
ABDication, in its original sense, means the voluntary renouncing
an office; but as offices are in these days seldom given up volun-
tarily, the word resignation, which expresses the act of resigning
one's-self unwillingly to fate, is used with reference to retirement
from place, which is almost always imperative. Abdication is now
applied exclusively to the running away of sovereigns from thrones
that are in a tottering condition. The last case of the kind that
has occurred, or, as we hope, ever will occur, in England, is that
of the exceedingly well-bred dog of the true KING CHARLEs's
breed, known as JAMEs THE SEcond, who, observing preparations
for ejecting him, cut, but did not come again to the throne.
ABERRATION (of Light), is in politics, as in astronomy, an appa-
rent alteration in the position of anything according to the place it
is viewed from. A politician who shifts his own ground, fancies that
things are changed, and place makes a wonderful difference in the
mode of looking at the same objects.
ABJURATION (oath of), administered to an attorney on his admis-
sion, apparently for the purpose of putting a shilling into the pockets
of the usher, to drink luck to the new candidate for legal employment.
The oath denies the right of the Pope of Rome to exercise jurisdic-
tion in England, as if it was feared that his Holiness might start a
court of justice on his own account in some hole or corner of the
empire. It would be quite as much to the purpose to swear that the
EMPERon or CHINA may not exercise summary jurisdiction at Bow
Street Police Office, or that RusT1 KHAN may not sit in banco during
term at Westminster.
AborigiNEs, a term denoting the first inhabitants of a place, who
are generally in a wild and savage state, like the first residents at
Herne Bay, the Exeter ‘Change Arcade, and other outlandish places.
The American aborigines are offensive to the eyes of Yankee civili-
sation, which cannot bear to look on man in a barbarous state, and
the natives are being rapidly exterminated in the land of equality.
In a few years the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, or Greenwich Fair,
will be the only spots where the war-whoop of the Native Indian
may be heard in all its freshness and purity.
ABon TIon, a word often applied to a ministerial measure.
Absent EE, one who gets his income in one place and has his
establishment in another. Thus a London tradesman dining in the
City but living a little way out of Town, is liable to a charge of
absent-teeism. Some, however, having an income nowhere, and
living anywhere they can, become absentees only when they are
asked for money. The two teas, who got over the palings of
White Conduit House without paying their score, were absent-teas
in the sense alluded to.
Action, (in law,) from the Latin actio, the state of doing; an
action being frequently a continued do from beginning to end. An
action also means a battle ; and the term is therefore applicable to a
law-suit which generally terminates infrightful loss to both sides.
ADMIN1st RATION is the act of administering the goods of a person
who dies without a will, and hence the word administration has come
to mean collectively the government which distributes the goods of
the nation, which may be said to be, to a certain extent, without a will
of its own.
Adoption, taking as one's own the offspring of others, as SIR. R.
PEEL, in 1844–5, adopted all Lord John Russell's legislative little
ones. By the Roman law no one who had children of his own
could adopt other people's; and in conformity with this rule, SIR. R.
PEEL being without principles of his own, was free to adopt those of
the Whig Ministry.
THE BLACKFRIARS PIERAGE CASE.
This Pierage, though quite a new creation, is already in abeyance, for
there is some mistake as to the title, and every one is aware that the title
is the very essence of every Pierage. It seems that the grounds of
dispute are the mud which constitutes the bed of the river, and we
presume that this Pier, being confined to its bed, it must be regarded as
a dormant Pierage. The old Blackfriars Pierage, with its bar sinister—
or rail on the left hand—is nearly extinct from age, and the confirmation
of the title of the new Pier is consequently looked for with intense
interest. It is said that the new Pier is very inapproachable, and is
much too high, which we are extremely sorry to hear, for in these days
Piers must not be above contributing to the necessities of the people, and
the Pier of Blackfriars must be made to lower its head, if it be true that
it is of an improper altitude at present. We should be sorry to see a
popular Pierage like that of Blackfriars has been, and may be again,
earning the title of Barren of Accommodation.

WAR PANIC AT BRIGHTON.
THE inhabitants of Brighthelmstone were alarmed a little while ago by
the arrival of the French War Steamer, the Pluton, and it was generally
rumoured throughout the town that the French were in the act of in-
vading England, and that Joinville would take up his head-quarters at
the Albion. Some, who had no notion of what an invasion could be like,
ran down to the beach to look at it; and others, who had no notion of
being present at a thing of the kind, hurried off to town by the first train
after the French steamer appeared in the offing. The one artilleryman,
into whose arms all Brighton must rush for defence in the event of a
hostile attack on its unprotected shores, was busy rubbing up with sand-
paper the touch-holes of the pieces of ordnance, on which the Brightonians
rely “for safety and for succour.” Happily, the whole turned out to be a
false alarm; and originated in the fact that the French, not knowing how
to construct a breakwater, came over to see how CAPTAIN TAYLoR had
made his.
The crew of the French steamer, after looking at the breakwater, and
refreshing themselves with some shrimps and small beer, returned to their
vessel, where “Rien aller”—no go—was entered in the log-book as
the result of their expedition.

A NEW HISTORY FOR ENGLAND.
If it be finally determined upon that no statue of CRoxwell shall be
erected in the new Parliament House, the wise and dignified measure
will be followed by another equally sagacious and magnanimous. An
act will be passed, containing very stringent clauses, compelling all men
to bring in to a certain place—to be duly named—all copies of the
History of England; so that they may be i. like debased coin,
and a new History be issued ; which History shall satisfactorily prove
that CHARLEs STUART died, at a green old age, very comfortably in his
bed ; that John HAMPDEN flourished as a tax-gatherer, collecting ship-
money; that there was a certain Oliven CRomwell, a bluff-looking man,
with a wart on his cheek, who lived somewhere in Huntingdon, following
the trade of a brewer; and that men called PYM, WANE, and MARTIN, were
his quiet, pains-taking servants. The History will contain a very
touching narrative of all the circumstances of CHARLes THE FIRST's
death-bed—(he will be made to die of sheer old age)—with his paternal
advice to Charles THE Second, who will be proclaimed next morning at
St. James's.
It will also be shown that CHARLEs THE Second passed his leisure
hours translating Thomas-à-Kempis, and such other pious books;
that he was the most faithful of husbands; that—had he been blessed
with children—he would have been the tenderest of fathers, and very
probably the stanchest of friends. LADY CAstELMAIN, NELL Gwynne,
and such rosy sinners, will be treated as Niebuhr treats many whom we
have been accustomed to look upon as real personages, as men and
women of flesh and blood; namely, they will be shown to be pure
abstractions—mere heroines of fables. Jamies THE SEcond will die in
good time, in an English palace: for if it is not to be thought of that an
English king was ever decapitated, neither can it be allowed that a
British monarch was ever turned out of his realm. There will, to be
sure, be a little difficulty in bringing in the House of Hanover; but it is
difficulties only that test true genius. We have read historians who have
made GeoRGE THE Fourth “one entire and perfect chrysolite,” and his
wife CARoLINE a second LucRETIA. Thus, the House of Hanover, may—
in default of issue of the Stuarts—be made to descend direct from
JUPITER, and be duly conducted to St. James's by MERCURY. By
adopting this line of history, the great difficulty of that great wickedness,
Oliver CRomwell, will be got rid of, whilst new subjects of unexpected
interest will be supplied to the artists in fresco.

RAVEL expands the
* mind. We do not
issue this truth as a fire-
new coin from our own
mint; assuredly not ; we
merely call the attention
of our readers to its
beauty, as reflected upon
bypassingevents. QUEEN
Victoria goes to Ger-
many. She assists at the
inauguration of a statue
to genius that has left its
wondrous harmonies—
bodiless souls, floating
about the world—to up-
raise the hearts and
solemnise the minds of
men. There was an old,
odd, stone-deaf musician,
named BEETHoven.
Even whilst alive he
was thought by some
to have “something in
him :” nevertheless, no
man can show the house
in which a few years
back he dwelt. But now,
there is a huge statue
raised to the memory of
the wizard of sound, and
crowned heads vailed for

a time their greatness, doing homage to the royalty of genius. The King of
PRussia and the QUEEN or England forgot the stern republican in the musician.
The effect of that day's ceremony at Cologne upon the mind of our beloved
Queen will, on the twenty-third of next April, be made manifest on the heights
of Dover. We are not, at present, permitted to name our authority; but we speak
from a source of intelligence that, often as we have applied to it, never yet
failed us. What that source may be, we leave to the sagacity of the reader to
discover.”
Briefly then, QUEEN Victonia—touched by the ceremony at which she has
so lately assisted—has determined that a colossal statue of SHAkspeaRE shall
be erected at Dover on the Shakspeare Cliff: There is something grand in the
choice of the site. It is wisely and well determined that the image of the tutelary
genius of England shall stand a sea-mark to all nations: it is nobly conceived
that he who, above all, has written for the great family of man, should, upon the
rampart-cliff of his own England, receive the homage of every scion of the human
race. And his claim will be acknowledged. Not by manning of the yards—not by
that vapouring, noisy bully, blank-cartridge—but by that deep and silent reverence
of the soul, which the soul in its fulness pays to its benefactor. Not that we shall
object to a visible mark of respect, shown, sailor-fashion, to the Undying Philan-
thropist. No : it will be more than a pretty sight, as intelligence travels, and “the
circle widens as the earth spins round,” to see ships from all ports of the earth
lower their sails, like wild swans stooping in their flight, to the image of him who has
cast “a girdle round about the world”—a girdle made of the triple cord of love,
and gentleness, and truth All glory then to Queen Victon IA 1 who, in honouring
—in so far as royalty can honour—God-lighted genius, casts a lustre on herself and
reign 1 All glory to the monarch who, with the quick and delicate sympathies of
womanhood, acknowledges the power that makes the true grandeur of her own land
—who acknowledges in her native English, as breathed by SHAkspeaRE, a thoughtful
muse that softens and refines the world !
We have said that the inauguration of the statue will take place on the 23rd of
next April, the birthday of SHAkspeaRE. We might, if we would, give every
particular of the ceremony to be observed on the occasion; for we know that the

programme of the solemnity—so much has HER MAJESTY the matter
at heart—has wholly engaged the royal attention during the QUEEN’s
retirement at Coburg. As, however, the time approaches, we will
furnish our readers with a most minute account of the observances of
the ceremony. We shall at present content ourselves with stating that
the day of inauguration will be a holiday throughout England—that
the QUEEN herself will, by some cunningly-devised machinery, first
discover the statue to the world,—and that moreover, HER MAJESTY
will invite the royalty of every country to assist at the ceremonial.
It is said that a royal autograph letter has been already despatched
to the Emperor of China, inviting him to “knock head” to the poet
of the human race.
Everybody attending the festival will appear in a Shaksperian
character. HER MAJEsty, graciously to assure the diffident, will
represent Titania. We have not yet heard the character chosen by
PRINCE ALBERT. The great folks at the West-End are already in
a flutter of preparation. For if they were so strongly moved by the
idea of a costume-ball, which was to do honour to nobody but the
tailor and the milliner, what will they not do when required to mark

SPORTS FOR QUEENS:
s Punch is very frequently smuggled be.
yond the Pyrenees, we have been
solicited by DoNNA MENDozA—wife
of a Spanish refugee, residing in Sey-
mour Street, Somers-town—to print
the subjoined letter, that it may meet
the eye of the writer's sister, a lady
of high rank, residing at San Sebas-
tian.
“MY DEAR JAcINTA,
º “You know how much I hate
* this dull and foggy prison, England
—how much I yearn for the sweet
freedom, the blue heaven of our adored Spain. However, in the
next revolution but ten—and that cannot be longer than three months
—BALDom ERo EspañTERo will be paramount in Madrid, and we
shall again embrace.
“Beloved JAcINTA, you can have no idea of the sluggish blood of
these Britons—of their utter ignorance of romance—of their insensi-
bility to true heroism. Will you believe it?—they absolutely sneer at
our glorious bull-fights Yes, they condemn that gallant sport which
thrills the heart-strings of Spain's daughters—they denounce the
pleasure derived from disembowelled horses, with now and then a
crushed and wounded matador! It is only a few days since that some
of the audacious newspapers wrote in the most treasonous terms
about the bull-fights at San Sebastian (witnessed by our beloved
QUEEN-whom Heaven preserve 1 and her apostolic professor,)—and
moreover cast the venom of their ink upon that truly national game,
so dear to the hearts of Spaniards, of jumping at the head of a live
; and pulling it from its quivering body. Imagine the effrontery
of this 1
“I had given up these English as a dastard race—a nation of
cowards—incapable of nothing but killing men in equal fight—when
my hopes of what they may do yet were raised by accounts from
Germany. You must know that QUEEN Victon IA (whom Heaven
preserve ) has been to Saxe-Gotha, and there, with other royal
ladies, has witnessed the butchery of I know not how many stags,
in a way almost worthy of our own delicious bull-fights. All the
deer were driven into a corner, when the QUEEN and the royal
ladies, while the band played the Polka, were seated in easy chairs
at a table, to see the fun. Well, the slaughter began—the princes
fired away, the band playing the lustier; and, after two hours, nearly
all the brutes were killed. Then, says the Times' account:—
“‘The dead or dying deer were either dragged, or carried suspended from poles, across
towards the pavilion, where the huntsman plunged his enormous couteau de chasse into
their throats.”
The royal ladies, be it remembered by those who sneered at our bull-
fights and our game of goose, looking on. When the delightful
sport was over, why then, says the Chronicle :-
“‘The ladies passed along the line of dead on the way to their carriages. It was a
wretched sight. The poor creatures arranged side by side—their dull, dim, dead eyes
looking as ghastly as the wounds from which the clotted blood came oozing in black
drops down the yet warm carcass. I had as lief see a knacker's yard.”
“After this, dear JAcINTA, I must confess I have some hopes in
the spirit of English ladies. I do hope, that, influenced by the highest
example, there may yet be bull-fights, and games of pull-goose in
Hyde Park; and that at least until that glorious time arrive, young
ladies of the very best families will gradually accustom themselves
to bear the sight by attending the westernmost slaughter-houses on
killing-days. To be sure, to see an ox felled with a pole-axe, or a
sheep's throat cut, is hardly so exciting as to behold a herd of stags
butchered as above described ; nevertheless, the slaughter-house will
do to begin with.
“However, after this, let us have no sneering at our beloved
QUEEN of SPAIN, the toros and the goose, let Englishmen think of
Germany, and be quiet.
“Your affectionate Sister,
* MARIA MENDozA.”
B R U TUS, THE BA R RISTER.
Down with the Press The hireling pens, who're paid for what
they write,
Who make a bad cause plausible, and alter black to white;
Let others coin their brains for dross, here’s one that never can,
For BRUTUs is a Barrister, “an honourable man l’”
'Tis true, in Justice’ holy cause a point I sometimes strain;
I own with pride I've done it, and hope to do again:
For such has been the rule of Court since first the Bar began,
And “Barrister” was synonyme for “honourable man l’”
Suppose my client be a rogue, he is my client still ;
To prove the guilty innocent's the triumph of my skill;
The truth or falsehood of my tale the judge sits there to scan,
I'm not the less a Barrister, “an honourable man l’”
You'd stare to see how I can wind the jury round my thumb,
How fast and free my tears can flow, when sentiment I come ;
A timid witness I browbeat, an honest one trepan,
And all the world says, BRUTUs is “an honourable man 1"
While pleading for a murderer, (I brought him off scot free,)
The fool confess'd ; but I was bound by honour and my fee :
Of course I finish'd the defence, which I’d so well began,
And his Lordship said I'd acted as “an honourable man!”
I’m anything but squeamish, but still–stoop I to report f
Why every curl would stand erect on every wig in Court 1
No, never ! Thus upon the Press I place my solemn ban,
I, BRUTUs, Barrister-at-Law, and “honourable man!”
Appropriate Present.
It is not generally known that PRINCE ALBERT-" his brows bound with
victorious garlands,”—on his return to the Isle of Wight from deer-
killing, was waited upon by a deputation of ladies, who presented him with
a blue apron, very curiously worked, in honour of his recent conquest of
the stags. The ladies represented the body of butchers' wives of
London, and the blue apron was worked with a couteau de chasse, and
various gouts of blood, in scarlet silk. We understand that the master-
butchers themselves intend to offer for the royal acceptance a magnificent
knife, and a beautiful steel, manufactured from the very best German
metal. It is further stated that SIR H. Bishop proposes to compose a
new Royal catch, the burden of which will be—“What will ye buy ; ”
The articles in question will, no doubt, be preserved as part of the
Regalia, and consigned to the curatorship of MR. Swifte, of the Tower,
to whom by-the-bye we alluded erroneously the other day as the showman
of the Crown, whereas he is entrusted with the honourable office of Viceroy
of it. -

HIGH TREASON.
A TRAITOR, who signs himself ALPHA, and writes in the Times, writes
thus:– -
“It is no use to conceal the fact—British high art is hated at Court, and dreaded by
the aristocracy. They don’t want it; they can’t afford it; they think any art, which
does not cultivate their vanity or domestic affections, can have no earthly use!”
We trust that the writer of the above will be immediately committed to
the Tower, there, in due season, to be brought to the block: or, if we might
suggest a still more terrible punishment, we would propose that he should
be sent to the School of Bad Designs, Somerset House, there to have his
head taken off, as only MR. WILson, the master, can perform the opera-
tion. Hence, we would not kill the traitor at once, but destroy him by
lingering agonies.
A WALK IN OUR SLEEP.
have never before confessed it to the
world, but we do sometimes walk in our
sleep. How we have escaped a mortal
cold, how we have so often escaped the
police, has often puzzled us to explain.
We are apt to put down our preservation
to our “cheerful faith,” as our friend
WoRDsworth has it, that we are the
favourite of Fortune; and when, in truth,
we think of the dolts and nincompoops
that Fortune, in her day, has fondled and
coddled, we think she only does something
like reparation to the world at large, by
taking such tender care of Punch t
The favourites of Fortune 1 Merciful Momus Here, Toby, good
dog—fetch us the Red Book, and in a trice we’ll pick out five hundred
favourites, who—Toby doesn’t think it worth his while, but yawns,
curls himself round head to tail, and slightly snores. Toby is right;
the folly of Fortune is too obvious; 'twould be to hold a rushlight to
the sun to show it.
Be it understood, then, that we walk in our sleep. Well, a night
or two since, we left our eider-down, at 92, Fleet Street, and—when
we do walk in our slumbers, we walk a clipping pace—in a short
time found ourselves in the primitive village of Fulham. We pro-
ceeded down a narrow lane that led to the church. We suddenly
paused, for there, under the midnight sky, and immediately beneath
a gas-light, stood a mendicant. Reader, that man had all the
externals of a Bishop. And yet—thought we—it is strange he
should beg at midnight; and then, again, we made every philoso-
phical allowance for the inveteracy of habit.:
The mendicant was one, who, it was plain, had seen better days.
There still upon his cheek lingered traces of happier times. His
face was somewhat flushed with a departing rosiness. He was a
wreck, it was true—but, like other wrecks we have heard of, he still
preserved a very jolly figure-head. He looked with a sweet boldness
in our face, and jerked the string that held his dog, that held in his
mouth a very curious cap: we have seen such, if we mistake not, in
cathedral windows. The dog—although, we are sure of it, he had
been whelped in a cellar, and had in his day led a blind fiddler—the
dog seemed ashamed of his present occupation. We have heard
of an apocryphal blue dog that blushed in a dark entry; blush as he
might, he never blushed so deeply as that dog in the lane at Fulham.
“Is it possible,” said we, addressing the reverend man, “is it
possible that you can be so destitute as to beg f What can have
brought you to this dreadful pass!”
“Bricks and mortar ! Bricks and mortar,” said the Bishop.
“We’re regularly built out.” And then, in moving accents, he told
some of his sorrows : how 30,000l. had been spent upon one MR.
CHATHAM, and how, from knowing nothing of book-keeping, he and
his friends had run through three millions of money. “It’s a
wicked world”—said he—“and we wer'n't brought up to know
anything of arithmetic.” Tears rolled down his cheeks, as he added
—“The builders have gammoned us.” Drying his tears, he cried
in a chirping voice—“If you’re a Christian, give us sixpence 1”
“Give you sixpence 1”—we cried, “we’ll
“Come, you must walk on—no noise here,” cried a policeman, and
he shook us wide awake. How delighted were we to find that it was
all a dream. That we had seen no Bishop—had looked upon no dog
—had heard no story of being built-out—and, more than all, that
30,000l. had not been spent upon one MR. CHATHAM.
With a lightened heart and very cold feet, we took a back cab and
returned to bed. Still something of the vision would haunt us : for
in our late slumbers we saw the Bishop of London in his oaken
study at Fulham, buried in profoundest meditation. On one side of him
laid a copy of the Ecclesiastical Commission, and on the other Cocker's
Arithmetic. And his grace sat meditating—painfully meditating—
how he should best make those two books meet !
STEAM FOR THE MILLION.
SoME enterprising speculators, jealous of the success of the fourpenny
fleet, have started an experimental squadron of twopenny steamers, which
have been advertised as Steam for the Million; but as penny boats have
since commenced running, we presume that “Steam for the Billion "
will now be the cry of the Company. If the mania for this kind of navi-
gation increases, we don't know where names are to be found for the
various vessels that are being daily launched on the Battersea billows, to
be tossed on the waves of Westminster, and find a haven at Hungerford.
We have already had the flower-beds exhausted to provide titles for the
Daisy, the Primrose, the Pink, and the Daffydowndilly; but we are
told the Polyanthus is now upon the stocks, and the keel of the Crocus is
already laid in the Fulham Dockyards. The social relations have been
used up by the iron boats, which rejoice in the titles of Bridegrooms,
Brides, Bachelors, Fathers and Sons of the Thames, and the various
shades of Moonlight, Daylight, and Twilight, have been applied to other
craft belonging to the same company. Entomology is now being resorted
to, and the Ant and the Bee were placed on the Adelphi station a few
days ago, to carry penny passengers. We have heard it whispered that
Geology is to supply another series of steamers, which will shortly come
forth with the astounding names of Megatherium, Deinotherium, Ichthyo-
saurus, and Anti-Megatherium, for the purpose of taking people at the
rate of three a penny from Lambeth Palace to the Temple.
An Epistolary Rocket.
We understood that it was against the law to transmit explosive
substances by post; but we have received a burst of fiery indignation,
evidently designed to blow us up, from a friend of the LATE Chief Justice
of Newfoundland, repudiating the application to him of the little anecdote
of the chop at HATCHETT's, and the candidateship for the Court of Requests
Judgeship. In referring to our last week's number it will be found that
the LATE Judge of Newfoundland was not alluded to. The individual
who indulged in a little touting from the box in HATCHETT's coffee-room
was in a transition state from the Bar of England to the Bench of
Newfoundland, but the late Judge is by far too good a judge of what is
due to himself and his profession to have been guilty of the indecorum
which his successor seems to have committed.

MEDITATIONS ON SOLITUDE.
By our stout commissioxER.
un drawing-room at the Regent is a desert.
Sº You can’t get a rubber of whist in the
evening, for the card-players are all gone.
PuFFINs is the only man left in the
smoking-room, and he is such a bore, that
solitudeis pleasant compared to his fright-
A ful conversation. All the house-carpets
* are up, and the place infested with abomi-
nable scourers, gilders, and whitewashers.
The house-steward is out of town : the
French cook has got leave of absence, and
I believe the hall porter is gone to the
Moors. It is September in a word, and I
am alone and deserted.
All the familiar places where you get dinner during the season are
shut up. They are painting HonANob's house. CARVER's shutters
are closed in Portland Place, and the parlour-blinds are pinned up
with newspapers. I wonder whether the Bog LEs like frying at
Naples as well as their cool pleasant house in Hyde Park Terrace
What capital 34 Claret that was of Bog LE's ; that last batch from
CARBon EL's, I mean. Dear EMILY Bog LE | I thought there was a
tear in her eye as I led her down to the carriage at LADY Kicksey's,
and said farewell. I wish to Heaven Bog LE would come back.
Not so much about EMILY ; but his cook makes the best white-soup
in England.
Why the deuce did not Sra. John Kicksey ask me down to Kick-
sey Acres. I gave him hints enough. I told him I could not go
abroad this autumn—that I thought of going to shoot in his neigh-
bourhood at old HAwcock’s. I told the old brute as much three
times, and he always turned the conversation. Does he fancy there
is anything serious between me and ELIZA Psha . I can't marry
twelve thousand pound. The girl was rather sweet on me, I confess.
But her mother is bent upon marrying her to a title; and the way
in sº she is manoeuvring poor little TUF To, makes all London
laugh.
Out of the six red-jacketed villains who used to hold your horse
opposite the palace in St. James's Street, (the claret at the guards'
mess has been remarkably good this year, and I warrant you there's
no stint,) only two are left. I asked where the head of the gang
was—the squinting one He is gone abroad, upon my conscience
To Baden-Baden, or the Pyrenees, no doubt.
The number of men growing moustachios during the last two
weeks of August, was quite facetious. Snuffy upper lips met you
everywhere. I met Sw1NNEY, the artist—snuffy upper lip ; his hair
is of a light hue, and the incipient whisker looked like a smear of
Welsh High-dried. He was going up the Rhine, he told me, and
blushed as I sneeringly pointed to the ornament beginning to deco-
rate his jolly face. I met QuAcKLE, the barrister—snuffy upper lip.
He has made nine or ten thousand in the committees this year, and
is off for three weeks' pleasuring. I warrant he didn't blush when I
alluded to the black stubble sprouting under his beak of a nose.
QUAcKLE blush, indeed! I went into BULTER and Vogel’s, my
tailors', in Clifford Street—snuffy upper lip again"; not BulTER’s,
who is a family man, and has his villa at Roehampton; but Vogel's
moustache bids fair to be as long as that of TIMoun THE TARTAR.
He has a right to the whiskers, however, being a tailor, and a Count
of the empire.
But the best of the moustachios that I have heard of is that of old
WAPshot, our tutor at Oxford, who was detected in Belgium,
whiskered, in a green-frogged coat, and calling himself Colon El
WALDEMAR.
If our people are invading the Continent in great force, on the
other hand, the influx of Frenchmen hitherwards is prodigious. I
never saw so many of the little smug, self-satisfied, high-heeled,
narrow-ribbed, be-stayed, be-whiskered, be-curling-ironed, under-
sized generation. They are jabbering about every corner of
Leicester Square and Regent Street; and you see the little ricketty
creatures peering in at the empty club-house doors, or chaffering
with cabmen for their fares.
I saw two of them standing on Richmond Hill the other day, and
patronicing it. C'est joli, says one ; c'est pas mal, says the other; as if,
now they had given their opinion, the view might pass muster. And
then one of the little dwarfs curled his waxed moustache, and
leered at Mas. Blobby's handsome nursery-maid, who was passing
with about eleven of B.'s youngest children.
It can't be helped. Do what you will, you can't respect French-
men. It’s well of us to talk of equality and amity. But we can't
keep up the farce of equality with them at all. And my opinion is,
that the reason why they hate us, and will hate us, and ought to
hate us for ever, is the consciousness of this truth on one side or the
other. It is not only in history and in battles, but we are domineer-
ing over them in every table d'hôte in Europe at this moment. We
go into their own houses, and bully them there. We can't be
brought to believe that a Frenchman is equal to an Englishman. Is
there any man in England who thinks so in his heart? If so, let him
send his name to the publishers.
This huge desert of a London is abominable. Everybody is gone !
Everybody. It’s heart-breaking to pass from house to house, and
think glasses are covered, the carpets are up, the jolly Turkey-rug
gone from under the hospitable mahogany, 'neath which your legs
have reposed so often, and the only inhabitant of the mansion a
snuffy char-woman. How to pass your evenings? In theatres—to
see clumsy translations from the French—to see vulgarised multi-
plications of Mas. CAUDLE. The passion for the Stage is like the
love of gooseberry-fool—strongest in youth. The only thing in the
dramatic art which has survived early youth in my love, is WIDDI-
combe, and he is always new. But you can not do, WIDDIcom BE,
more than six times in a season.

I could not leave town or its neighbourhood, being (between our-
selves) chairman of the Diddlesex Junction ; and exceedingly anxious
about the Great Pedlington line, (with a branch to Muffborough and
Stagg's End). And the above observations were written in the
deepest despondency, as I sate at dessert, alone, in the enormous
coffee-room of the Regent Club : when suddenly, the bright idea rose
to my mind,-if London is empty, why not go to the watering-places !
Have you ever been at Bagnigge Wells, you who know Baden so well ?
Have you who have beheld the pyramids (ille ego qui quondam, &c.),
ever glanced at Rosherville Gardens ! Tivoli is a very nice place;
but what do you say, my lad, to Tunbridge You who have seen the
caverns of Posilipo, say, have you beheld the Swiss Cottage and
Grotto, Shoreham, near Brighton Go out, and be a Commissioner
for Punch at the watering-places of this great kingdom.—And my
soul was refreshed at the thought, and I knew the first moment of
happiness I have enjoyed (for the Diddlesex Junctions are somehow
low in the market) since the end of the term.
THE DYING ONE.
THERE is a kid-glove cleaner in Gravesend who says, in one of his
circulars, that “he has had the honour of dyeing for the Royal Family,
and scouring for the House of Lords for the last twenty-six years.”
We really think this worthy fellow is entitled to a pension. His dying
so repeatedly for HER MAJEsry surely deserves some national acknow-
ledgment, but his being employed for such a number of years in keeping
the House of Lords clean would make any extravagant sum that was
given to him appear dirt-cheap. After the situation of the Clerk, who
is obliged to listen to LoRD BRough AM making five speeches on each
question, we can imagine no duty in the House more laborious than that
of keeping it continually clean. Cleaning the Augean Stables must have
been an old charwoman's work compared to it; and yet we will be bound
to say, this modern Hercules is modestly employed at Gravesend, like a
second CINCINNATUs, in cultivating his summer cabbages, unconscious of
the great good he has done his country. Let SIR Robert PEEL give
another proof of his active appreciation of merit by finding out this noble
successor of our HAMPDENs, and elevating him to that House his whole
energies and knees have been bent upon for six-and-twenty years. Surely,
after cleaning the whole House for a quarter of a century, no one would
be mean enough to deny him a seat in it !
The Awkward Squadron.
It seems the vessels of the Experimental Squadron are dreadful slow
coaches. Some of them only go eight, miles an hour. . We propose
that their names be altered to suit their intuitive powers of slowness, for
it looks like mockery to call a vessel The Monkey, when it goes no faster
than a night cab-horse. We suggest that the Grampus be re-christened
the Tortoise—that the Jackal be changed into the Snail—and that the
slowest of the lot be appropriately called The Omnibus, or The Chancery
Suit. The Monkey steamer might take the name of Prince Joinville,
out of compliment to his pamphlet for invading England, for we must say
we never knew anything in nautical matters slower than that.

SOUTHWARK ELECTION.
We were much shocked the other day at seeing two individuals rolling
about the streets in a fearful state of intoxication, bearing enormous
placards inscribed—
* * One of Ourselves.”
We were naturally anxious to know who the inebriated boardmen could
possibly be claiming as a congenial spirit, when one of them, happening to
give a sudden whirl round, disclosed another board at his back, with—
“Pilcher for southwark."
printed in conspicuous characters. Surely MR. Pilcher's committee cannot
sanction two drunken emissaries going forward into the public streets, and
identifying PILCHER with themselves.
Protestant would take care in future that the individuals selected to carry
the boards inscribed “Vote for PILCHER, one of us,” should at least keep.
sober.
IMPORTANT, IF TRUE.
THE contest between the Morning Papers for a priority of fashionable
intelligence places one or two of those journals fearfully on their mettle in
the collection of facts relating to the movements of the aristocracy. A
constant struggle is going on between the emissaries of the papers, to be
first in the announcement of an intended diplomatic dinner or “the
dansante,” and each paper has now its JENKINs, who is employed to
flirt with the housemaids in the fashionable squares," for the purpose of
getting into their confidence and extracting from them in their weaker
moments—“exclusive intelligence.” Occasionally, in their efforts to get
at something new, the JENKINSEs sink into the mysterious, and we hear
of people whom we never heard of before doing things that are of as
little consequence as the individuals who do them. One of them has
lately dug up from the mine of obscurity an individua whose movements
have been made the subject of the following paragraph:—
“CAPTAIN-Cuddy left town yesterday for Scotland, to join his brother-in-law, John
CLAUD1us BERRsford, Esq., cousin to his Grace the Lord Primate of Ireland, on board
his yacht the Ada, at Islay. CAPTAIN CUDDY, after making a tour in Scotland, will
proceed to Ireland on a visit.” -: - -
This paragraph has a good deal puzzled us, and has suggested to us
the following series of interrogatories:—
1st. Who is CAPTAIN CUddy ?
2nd. How does his leaving Town affect the public so as to make his
departure a matter of interest ?
3rd. Why introduce the name of “John Claudius BEREsford, Esq.,
cousin to his Grace the Lord Primate of Ireland,” unless for the purpose
of showing that Cuddy has a sister who married a gentleman, or that
Cuddy himself married the sister of a gentleman, whose father or mother
married either the brother or the sister of the father or mother of
the Lord Primate of Ireland
4th. Does the Lord Primate of Ireland keep a yacht; and how is it
that his Grace can find time to be on board of her at Islay?
5th. What tour is the Captain going to make in Scotland, and why? and
if he is—what matters?
6th. Who cares about his intended visit to Ireland
Perhaps the Editor of the Paper in an early leading article will oblige
us with an answer to these queries. -

MRS. CAUDLE'S CURTAIN LECTURES.
LECTURE XXXIII.
MRS. CAUDLE HAS DISCOVERED THAT CAUDLE IS A RAILWAY
DIRECTOR.
“WHEN I took up the paper to-day, CAUDLE, you might have
knocked me down with a feather Now, don't be a hypocrite—you
know what’s the matter. And when you haven't a bed to lie upon,
and are brought to sleep upon coal-sacks—and then I can tell you,

the matter. Now, I’ve seen your name, and don’t deny it. Yes,

silent. What do I see ? Why, there, MR. CAUDLE, at the foot of the
bed, I see all the blessed children in tatters—I see you in a gaol, and
the carpets hung out at the windows. -
“And now I know why you talk in your sleep about a broad and
narrow gauge 1 I couldn't think what was on your mind,+but now
it’s out. Ha! Mn. CAUDLE, there's something about a broad and
narrow way that I wish you’d remember—but you’ve turned quite
a heathen : yes, you think of nothing but money now. Don't I like
money? To be sure I do; but then I like it when I'm certain of it;
no risks for me. Yes, it’s all very well to talk about fortunes made
in no time: they’re like shirts made in no time—it’s ten to one if
they hang long together. -
“And now it’s plain enough why you can't eat or drink, or sleep, or
do anything. Your mind's cut up into railways; for you shan't make
me believe that Eel-Pie Island's the only one. Oh no l I can
see by the looks of you. Why, in a little time, if you haven't as
many lines in your face as there are lines laid down 1 Every one of
your features seems cut up, and all seem travelling from one
another. Six months ago, CAUDLE, you hadn't a wrinkle; yes, you'd
a cheek as smooth as any china, and now your face is like the map of
England.
“At your time of life, too ! You, who were for always going small
and sure You to make heads-and-tails of your money in this way !
It’s that stockbroker's dog at Flam Cottage—he's bitten you, I'm
sure of it. You're not fit to manage your own property now ; and I
should be only acting the part of a good wife, if I were to call in the
mad-doctors. -
“Well, I shall never know rest any more now. There won't be a
soul knock at the door after this, that I shan’t think it's the man
coming to take possession. "Twill be something for the CHALKPITs
to laugh at when we’re sold up. I think I see 'em here, bidding for
all our little articles of bigotry and virtue, and—what are you
laughing at . They’re not bigotry and virtue; but bijouterie and certu ?
It's all the same ; only you’re never so happy as when you're taking
me up.
“If I can tell what's come to the world, I’m a sinner! Every-
body's for turning their farthings into double sovereigns and cheating
their neighbours of the balance. And you, too—you're beside your-
self, Cauble-I’m sure of it. I’ve watched you when you thought
me fast asleep. And then you’ve lain, and whispered and whispered,
and then hugged yourself, and laughed at the bed-posts, as if you'd
seen 'em turned to sovereign gold. I do believe that you sometimes
think the patch-work quilt is made of thousand pound bank-notes.
“Well, when we're brought to the Union, then you’ll find out
your mistake. But it will be a poor satisfaction for me every night
to tell you of it. What, MR. CAUDLE They won't let me tell you of it?
And you call that “some comfort tº And after the wife I’ve been to
you ! But now I recollect. I think I’ve heard you praise that
Union before; though, like a fond fool as I’ve always been, I
never once suspected the reason of it.
“And now, of course, day and night you’ll never be at home?
No, you’ll live and sleep at Eel-Pie Island I shall be left alone
with nothing but my thoughts, thinking when the broker will come,
and you’ll be with your brother directors. I may slave and I may
toil to save sixpences; and you’ll be throwing away hundreds.
And then the expensive tastes you’ve got | Nothing good enough
for you now. I’m sure you sometimes think yourself KING Solo-
Mon. But that comes of making money—if, indeed, you have made
any—without earning it. No : I don’t talk nonsense: people can
make money without earning it. And when they do, why it's like
taking a lot of spirits at one draught; it gets into their head, and
they don't know what they’re about. And you're in that state
now, MR. CAUDLE: I’m sure of it, by the way of you. There's a
drunkenness of the pocket as well as of the stomach,-and you're in
that condition at this very moment.
“Not that I should so much mind—that is, if you hare made
money—if you’d stop at the Eel-Pie line. But I know what these
things are: they're like treacle to flies: when men are well in 'em,
they can’t get out of 'em : or if they do, it’s often without a feather
to fly with. No : if you've really made money by the Eel-Pie line,
and will give it to me to take care of for the dear children, why,
perhaps, love, I’ll say no more of the matter. What! Nonsense 2
Yes, of course: I never ask you for money, but that's the word.
“And now, catch you stopping at the Eel-Pie line ! Oh no, I
know your aggravating spirit. In a day or two I shall see another
fine flourish in the paper, with a proposal for a branch from Eel-Pie
Island to the Chelsea Bun-house. Give you a mile of rail, and—I
know you men, you'll take a hundred. Well, if it didn't make
me quiver to read that stuff in the paper, and your name to it !
But I suppose it was Mn. PRETTY MAN's work; for his precious
name's among 'em. How you tell the people ‘ that eel-pies are now
become an essential element of civilisation’—I learnt all the words
by heart, that I might say 'em to you—" that the Eastern population
of London are cut off from the blessings of such a necessary, and
that by means of the projected line eel-pies will be brought home to
the business and bosoms of Ratcliffe-highway, and the adjacent
dependencies.' Well, when you men—lords of the creation, as you
call yourselves—do get together to make up a company, or anything
of the sort, is there any story-book can come up to you? And so
you look solemnly in one another's faces, and never so much as
moving the corners of your mouths, pick one another's pockets.
No : I'm not using hard words, Ma. CAUDLE—but only the words
that’s proper.
“And this I must say. Whatever you’ve got, I'm none the better
for it. You never give me any of your Eel-Pie shares. What do
you say? You will gire me some 2 Not I–I’ll have nothing to do with
any wickedness of the kind. If, like any other husband, you choose
to throw a heap of money into my lap—what? . You'll think of it?
When the Eel Piº go up? Then I know what they're worth—they'll
never fetch a farthing.”
“She was suddenly silent—writes CAUDLE—and I was sinking
into sleep, when she nudged me, and cried, ‘CAUDLE, do you think
they'll be up to-morrow '" -

PUNCH's POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
pultenarion, a very important branch. of
commercial industry. Though adulteration
has been prohibited by several acts of
Parliament,it is a species of manufacturing
skill which improves whatever it is em-
ployed upon. It turns the humble cabbage-
leaf into the wholesome cheroot, and con-
verts the coculus Indicus, the quassia, the
liquorice, into porter, or some other equally
popular beverage. Sand is elevated into
sugar; sloe-leaves are exalted into tea; and
alum takes its place by the side of flour
as an ingredient, in the great staff of
all our existences. The statutes against
adulteration, being regarded as a check on
the progress of science, are usually disre-
garded by that great and glorious character, the British merchant.
It is, perhaps, a patriotic preference for the productions of his native
land, which induces the English cigar-dealer to seek the Savoy of
Great Britain rather than the weed of Bengal; and the same feeling
no doubt actuates the tea-merchant when he looks for a profit-sloe
and sure—from the suburban hedges.
Advocate, from the Latin words ad, to, and cocare, to call; because
an advocate is at the call of any one who needs his services. The
early Roman advocates professed to plead gratuitously, but some
of them were soon detected in taking fees indirectly, by making no
charge, but “leaving it to the generosity” of their employers.
Clients were “expected” to give something to the advocate, and
were no doubt considered to have acted shabbily if they shirked it ;
so that at last a regular charge was made, and some of the Roman
barristers used to receive so much a head from as many as chose to take
shares in these joint-stock advocates. At length the gentlemen of
the Roman long-robe became so greedy, that it was found necessary
to limit their fees, the maximum of which was fixed at ten thousand
sestertii, which the classical student may at his leisure reduce to six-
and-eightpences. The advocates were paid generally in asses, or brass,
and they paid those asses their clients usually in the same metal.
The fees were always payable before the cause was pleaded ; and it
was a rule that if the advocate died, or did not, or could not, or would
not, attend to his duties, the sum he had received was in no case to
be given back again. “No money returned” was the motto of the
IRoman as well as of the English barrister.
AGENT, is a-gent acting for another gent, and is derived from the
Latin word agens, doing, because an agent is often doing his principal.
AGRAR1AN LAws related to the public lands; and Spunius
Cassius, who was called spurious to distinguish him from the genuine
Cassius, was the first poor man's friend who proposed an agrarian
law; for which piece of patriotism he was tried, condemned, and put
to death in no time. Subsequently, SEMPRoN1Us GRAcchus, who
was the Lond AshLEY of his day, carried an agrarian law founded
on the small allotment system; and he was murdered in an election
row, as a reward for his good intentions. His brother, Carus GRAc-
chus, who wished to see the poor settled on their own land, got
settled himself, in a shindy, when putting up for the tribuneship.
Other Roman radicals passed agrarian laws, but Radicalism was so
unfashionable that its adherents got assassinated very rapidly. The
professed object of the agrarian law was to divide the public land
among the poor, so that every Roman should grow his own cabbage,
as the people of Cos reared their own lettuces.
AGRICULTURE, Societies For THE PRomotion of. The head
of these Institutions is the Agricultural Association of England,
whose chief objects are to keep science moving, and to bring animals
to a dead stand-still by their excessive fatness. There are also pro-
vincial societies, some of which carry round the country a quantity
of over-sized beasts to make a show of them, on the same principle
as Wombw ELL’s travelling menagerie. Megatherium bullocks, and
sheep that look like moving mountains of wool, are consequently
collected into the shape of an agricultural annual.
AIDs having been all abolished, except lemon-ade and orange-ade,
which do not savour of politics, we have torn up three sheets of anti-
quarian lore, two pages of enthusiasm, one of constitutional learning,
and six lines of vehement invective, which we had prepared on this
subject. The MS. will lie for inspection for one week at our butter-
man's, after which it will be allotted in shares to his various
customers.
AlpenMax. This word, after being macadamised with the sledge-
hammer of Saxon research, is knocked into ealdorman, then into ealdor,
then into eald, and finally into old-man; so that Alderman and jolly
old cock, were in Saxon times synonymous. There was formerly an
Aldermant's Regis, or King's Alderman, supposed to have been an
occasional judge; and if he dined with the king there could not have
been a better judge of the merits of the respective dishes, which was
perhaps the object of allowing the alderman to hold sittings in
mahogany with his Majesty. There are twenty-six London Alder-
men, and “the wonder is,” says GUNTER, “where all the real turtle
comes from to supply the demand that six-and-twenty London
Aldermen must of necessity occasion.”
Chi LDREN'S SONG FOR THE COBURG
GREGORIUS FEST.
WE’RE happy German children;
You praise our glossy hair,
Our wreaths and pretty costumes,
Our cheeks so fat and fair :
Our little bodies never
Grew stunted at the loom;
Our infant eyes ne'er ached in
The pit-seam's choky gloom.
We never sobb'd to sleep, on straw
Close crouched for warmth, like vermin–
We are not English children;
No, (Sctt ſet tant, we're German.
They say our English sisters
Are never blithe, as we ;
But, Queen, you look so gracious,
That this can never be.
They tell us they're ill nurtured,
Of raiment scant and rude-
Not picturesque, as we are—
A wild and wolfish brood I
Then bless good SAINT GREcoRius,
That did our lots determine—
We are not English children ;
No, Gott ſº tant, we're German.
When you go back to England,
You'll think on what you've seen ;
Then ask our English sisters
To dance upon the green.
Perhaps they’ll look less savage,
With seemlier clothes and food;
Perhaps with kindly teaching
You'll change their sullen mood.
'Tis sad that they should go in rags,
And you, their QUEEN, in ermine—
We are not English children;
No, Gottfºg tant, we're German
NAVAL MORBID ANATOMY.
THE Lords of the Admiralty, we understand, are going to do a good
thing. That will be something new, perhaps; but no matter. The
public is aware that there is something very rotten in the state of our
Navy in general, and that a large number of screws are loose in the steam
portion of it in particular. A serious impairment of the faculty of locomo-
tion is extensively prevalent among the vessels of the line. They halt and
bungle in their movements, nobody knows why; they are taken to pieces:
nobody is the wiser; they are put together again, and get on as lamely as
ever,
It is, therefore, we hear, the intention of their Lordships to establish in
the principal dock-yards Professorships of Naval Morbid Anatomy. The
object of the labours of the learned Professors will be the development
and exposition of the ricketty, carious, and ºther faulty structures, which
form so large a part of the organisation of our men-of-war.
In connection with these Professorships, will also, we believe, be
founded Museums, for the preservation of diseased specimens of timbers,
masts, rigging, paddle-wheels, and boilers. . We earnestly hope also that
the foundation will be completed by Hospitals, for the application of the
discoveries to be made by the dissection of the dead hull to the benefit of
the living craft. We trust also that those discoveries will lead to an im-
proved knowledge of the laws which ought to regulate the construction of
the ship, by attention whereto its liabilities to disorder may be prevented.

TEARS AT GOTHA.
HE Standard gives the following extract of
a letter from Gotha to a gentleman in
London —
* “This (the deer killing) was very shocking. The
QUEEN wept. I saw large tears in her eyes; and Hez
MAJEsty tells me that she with difficulty kept the chair
during what followed. When the QUEEN saw the otter
hunt in Scotland, the pity that she naturally felt at the
death of the animal was counterbalanced by a know-
ledge of his propensities, so that it is almost as meritorious
to destroy an ofter as it is a snake; but this was a totally
different case; nor is HER MAJEsty yet recovered. For
the Prince, the deer were too numerous, and must be
killed. This was the German method; and no doubt the
reigning Duke will distribute them to his people, who
jº PRInce ALBERT for providing them venison.’”
And so HER GRAcroUs MAJESTY was
shamefully entrapped into the sport 1 She had no idea whatever of
the sort of butchery about to be perpetrated; and when seated, like
the lady in Comus, she was compelled to look upon the abomination.
There she was—she, the greatest of earthly potentates—as BARRY
CoRNwall has it—
* Prison’d in ermine and a velvet chair,”-
the weeping victim of the iron necessity of state. Poor PRINCE
ALBERT, too, not being “to the manner born,” was of course wholly
ignorant of the kind of sport he was to take so lively a part in, and
therefore could not have communicated to his wife any hint what-
ever of the details. How, indeed, should he know anything about
them And thus, for two hours, was the QUEEN of ENGLAND com-
pelled to sit in suffering, with “large tears in her eyes,” whilst her
husband and her Secretary for Foreign Affairs continued to lacerate
her womanly feelings. Sometimes, how helpless is majesty I Even
QUEEN ELIZABETH once wished herself a milkmaid.
Touching the otter hunt, and the pity naturally felt by the QUEEN
at the death of the animal being “counterbalanced by a knowledge
of his propensities,” we may be allowed to observe, that there are
very many creatures necessary for our comforts to be killed, and yet
such knowledge hardly calls upon amateurs to be in at the death.
There is a certain destroyer who continually advertises himself as
killer to the Queen ; the scenes of his prowess being the bed-cham-
bers of the palaces. It is surely sufficient to know that he extirpates
the noisome intruders: the pleasure to be derived from absolutely
witnessing the slaughter is yet to be proved.
But the deer “were too numerous, and must be killed.” The
carcases would be distributed to the people, “who would thank
Parnce ALBERT for providing them venison.” At Christmas time,
we believe there are certain quantities of beef distributed to the
poor of Windsor. Is it necessary, them, for the greater grace, that
His Roy AL HIGHNEss should knock down the bullocks, and further,
that HER GRAcious MAJEsty should honour the butchering by her
presence?
. But Kings and QUEENs can do no wrong. Vulgar minds may for
a time judge them according to their acts; when a nobleman writes
a letter to his friend, the letter is extracted from, and all again is
couleur de rose.
REDUCED CLERGYMEN.
Fnow a recent statement in the Times, we learn that one Thomas
Blackwell, of Buckingham, was, on Thursday, September 4th, at the
magistrates' clerk's office in that borough, committed to the house of cor-
rection for two months, at the expiration of that term to find sureties in
5l. each, or one surety in 10l., for his good behaviour for twelve months;
and in default of doing so, to be imprisoned further for six months—
by the Reverends W. ANDREws and J. CokeR BLAckwell's offence
consisted in having, on the 25th of February, 1844, been in company
with two other persons guilty of poaching on the Duke of BuckINGHAM's
preserves.
It is really lamentable, and makes us more than ever indignant at the
conduct of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, to find that two Bucking-
hamshire clergymen—no doubt scholars, and gentlemen—should be so
destitute of any better occupation as to be reduced to the necessity of
acting; virtually, as a Duke's gamekeepers. Of course, in conformity
with their sacred calling, they dealt as mercifully with the culprit as they
could, and visited him with the lightest penalty that the law allowed for
the heinous crime of having been in company with poachers; but still
their task was an ungracious one—to say the least.
The business of a pastor is, undoubtedly, to look after his flock, and
not to attend to the preservation of game. The reverend shepherd has
enough to do to feed his sheep, without having to look after hares and
pheasants: but to force him in the latter vocation—to commit, instead of
feeding those very sheep—is beyond everything cruel. We hope some
charitable churchmen will find means of procuring for the Buckingham
clergy some more suitable employment than that of gamekeeping.
Qſìt 33rinte of &alts's $pelling-3300k.
We understand that a Spelling-Book is in preparation for the use
of the heir to the throne, in which the examples of his Parents will
be put forth in a Series of Easy Lessons, in one Syllable. We have
been favoured with a sight of a specimen, which proves how the
tastes and habits of papa and mama may be pleasantly put forward
for the imitation and admiration of the infant.
LESSON I.
The Deer is a poor weak Brute, which it is good to Kill.
It was once the Plan to Hunt the Deer; but it Runs so fast,
that it puts one quite in a Heat to try to Catch it. "A PRINCE
should not get Hot, or be at much pains to Hunt the Deer,
but should have the Deer all Caught, and put in a small Space,
which they can in no way get Out of. Then the PRINCE should
come with his Gun, and Shoot at the Deer, when he must Kill
some. It is fine Sport to see the Deer fall Dead in the Place,
where they are all put so Close that a PRINCE, Shoot how he
will, must Hit some of them. If you are a good Boy, you
shall have a Gun, and some Deer to Shoot at with the Gun;
and then they shall be all put Dead in a Row, for you to look
at them, Oh! what nice Sport for a PRINCE of the Blood
THE SOUTHWARK CONTEST.
SIR WILLIAM Molesworth having been returned for Southwark, it is
evident that he took his stand upon Hobbes to some purpose. We should
have thought Hobbes to have been rather hot ground; but the consti-
tuents, no doubt, thought of their hearths, and supported a candidate
whose regard for hobs was so loudly insisted on. If there had been a
Barrister, he might have taken his stand on one of the Bars—either
English or Irish, and thus added to the heat of the contest. Hobbes, of
course, includes a very wide range, and, some have thought, a little too
much latitude.
A Pretty Compliment.
According to the Journal des Débats, the Pope, lately, at Rome, went,
accompanied by several Cardinals, to celebrate the fête of St. Louis, to
the French Church at Rome. M. Rossi, the French Plenipotentiary,
opened the door of the Pope's carriage at the church door; and
“thanked His Holiness for the honour he had deigned to confer on the
French Church 1” We should think it was the Church that honoured the
Pope, and not the Pope the Church. The idea of any Clergyman, of any
rank or denomination, honouring a religious edifice, is to us rather odd.
But a French Ambassador has so much politesse 1 We have heard of an
exasperated Pontiff boxing a Prelate's ears for his impudence; but we
think that M. Rossi might have earned the same reward by his civility.
APPROPRIATE DECORATIONS.
A showy line of weathercocks has been erected along the new Houses
of Parliament. We detected “speaking likenesses” of particular members
in many of them. In one we perfectly traced the profile of LoRD
BRough AM, and in another the wig of the present LoRD CHANCELLOR.
This new style of portraiture is capitally adapted to such a building ; and
as it is closely allied to the Gothic, it is perfectly in character with the
other features that are prominent in the decorations of the future
ST. STEPHEN's.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
This tilting match, or tourney, has been carried on for some time
between the Press and the Bar; but it has at length ended in the
utter prostration of the latter. The tournament took its rise from
the feudal system, and a few dull Barristers have entered into the
tourney with a most congenial spirit.

and the pen, used as a lance, completely triumphed over the stick,
which is the emblem of many a Barrister. The public has watched
the progress of the combat from time to time, and our cartoon will
therefore tell its own story.
The Bar has been completely beaten, and has retired from the

LICKSPITTLEOFF, OF THE “MORNING POST,”
THE Russian editor of the Morning Post has a deep article—deep
as a thimble—on the continental movements of HER MAJEsty.
Yes, Lickspittleoff—for such is his real Tartar name—expa-
tiates, upon the royal privileges possessed by German sovereigns,
and then weeps tears of train-oil to think that QUEEN Victon 1A
may not govern “at her own sweet will”—that democratic England
is not iron-bound Prussia. LicksPITTLE of F, however, opens with
a grand fling at constitutional sovereigns. Even Louis-PHILIPPE,
who laughs at the revolution that placed him where he is, will not
satisfy Lickspitt Leoff. Here is a loud, swelling note :-
'...The QUEEN is going to Eu ! From Germany to France the distance, geographi-
cally speaking, is not great ; the voyage from Antwerp to Tréport will not be long, and
scarcely be wearisome. But the change, how vast !”
HER MAJESTY, however, did not at once plunge into a constitu-
..] tional cold bath. No ; she was somewhat prepared for the shock by
the tepid warmth of Belgium :—
“To be sure, Belgium, with its spick and span new monarchy, will be something like
* preparative, and the sudden transition from loyal sound-hearted Germany, where
Kings rule, and people are happy, to the France of suppressed factions and parvenu
royalty, will not be so abrupt as it would otherwise have been 1 ''
Lickspit TLEoff “doubts” whether any constitutional states—
“as they are called”—have ever benefited by their constitutions.
“Indeed, as far as we [Licksrittleoff] can make out, the primary object of
representative assemblies is the imposition of tares, and certainly such was the result
of the great development of the representative system in England which ensued '88.”
And, therefore, it would be much better that English parliaments
should be altogether abolished, and the fortunes of Englishmen—it
is so in Lickspittleoff's native Russia—be at the disposal of the
English monarch.
“It is nºt...in England, where railway kings rule, railway parliaments legislate,
expediency Ministers tyrannise, money-mongers, share-jobbers, and exchange-brokers,
** Pºtty princes—it is not in the England of speculation that the true functions of
royalty can be the most perfectly understood.”
You are right, sagacious Lickspittleofr—most right ! The
| “true functions of royalty,”—as understood by your Tartar soul—are
exercised in the unlimited application of the knout—in the banish-
ment of man, woman, and child, to Siberia—in holding, as it were,
the heart-strings of millions in the iron hand of King or Kaiser I
We have said that the presiding political genius of the Morning
Post is a Russian. As he is—as much as the bear in the Zoological
Gardens—a public character, we shall take an early opportunity of
giving his biography—of showing how he was found in a cradle by a
sentinel near the palace gates of St. Petersburgh—how he was brought
up, and taught the kind of English he knows, at the charge of the
EMPERoR—how he afterwards served in the EMPERoa's kitchen–
and how, subsequently, he became political editor of the Morning Post
for the conversion of the English. Lucky LicksP1TTLE off.)
A GOOD DAY'S SPORT.
We understand several of the Civic Companies have invited PRINCE
Albent to a day's sport in the City. They have offered to collect in the
area of the Stock Exchange all the bulls and bears that are in the habit
of prowling about the neighbourhood. As soon as these are despatched, a
number of desperate Stags, that have been brought up expressly by the
railways, will be driven from Capel Court into the interior, and His
Roy AI, Highness will be armed with unlimited power to hunt down as
many as he pleases. The lame ducks of the City will be reserved for the
last, as an especial treat.
The large room at Lloyd's has been fitted up handsomely for the
occasion, so that HIs Roy AL HIGHNEss will be put to no inconvenience or
fatigue, in firing at his leisure from a magnificent throne erected at the
largest window. WEIPPERT's Band will be in attendance. In fact,
nothing has been neglected to make this “Civic Battue” worthy of the
noble guest for whom it has been provided.
Burning AFRICA.
THE French papers, published in Africa, hint very strongly that it is
MARSHAL BUGEAUD's ambition to be crowned Monarch of Algiers. As he
will want a title, we suggest he be called “THE FIRE-King of ALGERIA.”

“I Must steal ten minutes to tell you how charmed we all are
with everything here. Such an agreeable disappointment. The reigning
Duke is really very comfortably off, and the
palace is a well-appointed place, such as one
might manage to live in very tolerably—dans
le cas. But the people, my dear girl—the
people! You never saw anything half so pic-
turesque and delightful,-more like the chorus
at the Opera, than real living peasants, such
as I've seen about Papa's place at home. And
they are so well bred; the men take their hats
off as one passes them, and the girls drop such
graceful curtsies . It is the thing here to be
– very affable, and mix freely with everybody.
Lord Stalk is very much distressed about the
effect it may have upon the Q-E-N, who has
not been used to that sort of thing. He says
it is dreadfully levelling and revolutionary;
but we all find it charming. Of course, one
couldn't think of doing anything of the kind
at home, where the labourers are so dirty and
disgusting, and wear nasty ginghams instead
-- == of the prettiest fancy costumes in the world.
º However, I own I should like to try some-
thing like the children's fete we have had here,
at Blank Park. One could get the dresses from
some of the men who do that sort of thing for
the Theatres, perhaps ; but I am puzzled about the waltzing. And then
the English school-girls are so awkward, and don't seem to know how to
behave before their superiors. And after all, I don't think Papa would
like it. So I suppose I must drop my project, tho' I assure you I never
spent such a pleasant hour in my life. It was the most novel thing in
the world to see everybody looking happy, and dancing as if they really
liked it. I wish MR. LUMley would have over a set of these German
peasants; I'm sure they would take if he could manage to let them out
to people for their fêtes champétres. I declare I'll ask LoRD STALK to
write and propose it. The Duke of BuckinghAM, you remember, tried
something of the kind at Stowe; but then he had English labourers, and
I fancy it was generally thought a failure. But I'm called away
suddenly.

FROM MISS JEMIMA FADDLE TO MISS SUSAN SLIPSLOP,
BERKELEY SQUARE,
‘Oh, My own Susan, “Rosenau, Coburg,
- “You never see anything like this outlandish place. Take my
advice, and if you advertise in the Times, don't go to say “has no objec-
tion to go abroad.” Where we are staying the 'ouse is a comfortable place
enough, but the bed's dreadful short, and mattresses put on the top of
you enough to smother a person used to English accommodations, which
I am thankful to say I am, and like to have my little comforts about me.
The second table is very comme ifaut, but nobody except ourselves speaks
English, which comes dull. The “courier' is an 'andsome man, and looks
more like a general than a servant, and very attentive to me.
“But the swarms of low people about the place is not to be mentioned—
I’d like to see our hall-porter a ordering of them out of Berkeley Square,
as he used the organ-boys and tortoises. They absolutely comes and
stands under the windows, a nodding and kissing their hands to my
lady, like anything, and then the quality goes and speaks to them—
set them up ! In fact, Susan, there ain't no distinction of ranks to speak
of, and ain’t that dreadful to one who has knowed better days, and her
father a small tradesman on his own account but if unfortunate, one's
feelings is like other people's, and knows one's own distance, and likes
other people to know theirs.
“Then there was a dance of the children called Saint Gregories.
And, would you believe it? I see HER MAJESTY, with my own blessed
eyes, a walking among them and a patting their dirty little heads—but
they dresses hair beautiful here, as I’m free to own, where merit is due.
Thank’Evans, she can't do them things at home, or there'd be a pretty
kettle of fish.
“I do declare there's a tall man in green shorts a lookin' in at the
window—and a showing his great white teeth at me—like his imperence,
lifting his hat to a lady and a perfect stranger, and an unprotected
foreigner into the bargain. I'm in such a trimmle, I can 'ardly conclude
myself, your loving friend and fellow-servant, -
“JEMIMA FApple,"
DEGLIN E OF BARTHOLOMEW FAIR.
ust now, as the decline of the drama finds so
many pens to weep ink over it, we think the
- decline of Bartholomew Fair calls for a few
tears on the part of Punch, who, he is not
ashamed to own it, has in his time very often
acted in Smithfield. Punch is perfectly aware
that many of his brother actors—some of
them, by the way, of very little more flesh
and blood than himself—would fain forget
y those saw-dust hours, seeing they are now
driving their trade according to Act of Par-
liament. Punch has no such vanity. He
delights to remember the days when he was
a vagabond. Punch—though he has 92,
Fleet Street, over his head, and is moreover
assessed for the income-tax (may PEEL be
blessed as he deserves for it!), Punch does
not forget the mud of Smithfield. . The
decline of Bartlemy Fair and of the drama
arises from the same cause. The race of
actors is almost extinct; gone out with the
megalonyx and the megatherium. The showmen on both sides have
become too genteel to do their calling naturally. They no longer throw
themselves, body and soul, into their art ; but touch it mincingly, as a
business altogether beneath them. The lover of the show and the lover
of the play-house are as wooden as wooden rattles, and breathe their
passion with the same harmonious eloquence. The clown and the low-
comedy man (how few the exceptions 1) paint their noses as though
there was no true histrionic glory in carmine, but, on the contrary,
a burning shame in it. And then for comedy ladies—but no, we will
not pursue the parallel, we will only weep over it.
Load Mayon Gibbs opened what was called the fair : A revelry that
—as the papers say—“but for the appearance of two or three ginger-
bread stalls, nothing out of the ordinary way would have been observed.”
How strange that wherever some people appear, ruin should immediately
present itself I Nevertheless, with all the public apathy towards the
festival, we are convinced that Gibbs himself—by his own unassisted
enius—might have crammed Smithfield. Not a show was on the ground.
magine, then, the rush, if Gibbs himself had taken a booth, and, at only
threepence a head, exhibited his balance of Walbrook.
Holiday Making."
The National Gallery closed last week. Several of the “Old Masters”
have left for the long vacation. The disputed Holbein started immediately
in a van and pair for St. Martin's Lane, where a new coat was waiting
for him. He is now on a visit to a long line of relatives in Rupert Street,
where he is looked up to as the head of the family. John Kemble,
Mercury, Hogarth, Pope Pius, Venus, and others, have gone to take the
waters, and are expected to return with quite a fresh colour and
renovated frames.

THE sea has evidently not improved in its manners since the time
of CANUTE ; nor is the French side of the ocean more remarkable
for loyalty and politeness than the English. NEPTUNE has not
learned manners since he laved the Saxon highlows of the English
KING, surrounded by his courtiers, who, like policemen, went on
exclaiming “Keep back,” while the waves continued to advance high
above their royal master's ankles.
We have been led into these half historical, half philosophical
remarks, by the account of HER MAJESTY's landing at Tréport.
Though the KING of THE FRENch was up early to receive the
T
(W
º
QUEEN, the sea would not rise before its usual hour, and there was
consequently not water enough to allow of HER MAJESTY's landing
in the customary manner. Louis-PHILIPPE, however, was not to be
baffled, and he thought at once of a bathing machine. The heureus:
idée was acted upon, and the QUEEN was driven in triumph to the
shore in a machine, for which Caicket T or Foat of Margate would
give any money, since it has been immortalised by a royal progress.
This is certainly the age of machinery; but the bathing machine is
not the one whose triumphs we expected to be called upon to record
in the middle of the nineteenth century. ,
BUSINESS AND PLEASURE.
OUR Continental friends have discovered that on her foreign trips,
Hen Majesty, however she may be seemingly possessed by
pleasure, has nevertheless one of her bright blue eyes always upon
business. According to German and French writers, Her Gracious
Majesty QUEEN Victonia is a commercial traveller, a royal bag-
woman to the firm of Bui.1, AND Company. Thus, the QUEEN cared
little about the glories of the Rhine. Oh, no the prevailing idea of
the royal mind was how to diddle the Zollverein in the matter of
cotton twist. At the very time they were shooting the deer at
Gotha, the QUEEN's thoughts were immersed in tallow—wrapt in
hides. And then HER MAJESTY, with the magic of her voice and
smile, has such a way of pushing the commerce of her native land
With that knowledge of human nature which is intuitive to royalty,
she, generally takes the dining hour as the most genial season to
push business. Our “own reporters” have supplied us with notes of
the following conversations; the victims being those unsophisticated
monarchs, WILLIAM of Prussia, and Louis-Philippe of France.

WAUXHALL AND THE FARMERS.
ontinued wet weather had thrown the nation into a
panic from which it has only just recovered, at the
threatened ruin of the harvest. For a considerable
time this phenomenon of incessant rain appeared
wholly unaccountable. South added an additional
lens to his telescope, and HERschEL analysed a
nebulous body from morning till night, but all to
no purpose; for no one could ascertain the cause
of the unusual quantity of wet weather. At length,
however, DR. South happened to see a bill of
== Vauxhall Gardens, announcing, the fact of their
= being open for the season; and, tearing down the
se poster, with a wild shout of “Eureka,” he rushed
frantically to a cab-stand, and was driven all the way
--~~ to the Observatory at Greenwich;-thus giving
Fº another instance of the absence of mind of great
men, and the absorbing nature of science; for he quite forgot the
railroad, that would have taken him in a few minutes to his destination,
which the cab was upwards of an hour in reaching.
We understand that the learned astronomer is about to publish a
report, in which he will prove, from the average of a series of years,
that a wet season and the opening of Vauxhall Gardens are necessary
co-existents, and as indissoluble as two inseparable gases. He thinks
there is an aqueous fluid taken up from the Thames, which gets absorbed
in the trees in the neighbourhood of Vauxhall, and when the fifty thou-
sand lamps are lighted—to say nothing of the five million additional on
gala nights, and the blaze of the fireworks—the heat expands the aqueous
matter, and distributes it all over the metropolis. After the aqueous
particles are once released, they may be blown about by the winds to any
distance; and thus we get rain over the whole of England, to the
imminent peril of the crops throughout the country.
Now we look upon this as a grand discovery, and we should suggest
that a good use might be made of it. There should be an act of Parlia-
ment positively prohibiting the opening of the gardens during the season
of harvest, but rendering it compulsory on the proprietors to give a series
of fêtes, galas, and masquerades in very dry weather, when rain is wanted.
As the arrangement would be arbitrary towards the lessee, we should
strongly recommend his having an indemnity, and as the shortness and
suddenness of the seasons would render Widdicomb's engagement difficult
to define, we think he ought to receive a pension, which, if age gives any
claim, ought to have commenced about the beginning of the reign of
George THE Second. The hermit might be put on board wages, or sent
to the Union Workhouse, where he would find plenty of food—for his
philosophy.
We seriously call upon the public who are interested in the price of
the four pound loaf, to aid us by their agitation in carrying out the
measure we have suggested. DR. South is, we believe, staunch, and
HERschel has given in his adhesion to the Vauxhall nebulous theory. ,
A DAINTY DISH TO SET BEFoRE A queen.
Sing a song of Gotha-a pocket-full of rye,

ACCIDENTS AND OFFENCES OF HISTORIANS.
MossIEUR THIERs has gone over to Spain for the purpose of collecting
materials for his new History. He intends to visit, it is said, the principal
battle-fields of the Peninsula. As all the smoke must have cleared away
by this time, Monsieur THIERs will be able to look at each of them in its
proper light. We hope, however, the ground has not shifted since the
late war, or else Monsieur THIERs will fall into exactly the same error as
the author of the Histoire du Consulat et de l'Empire, who, whenever he
looked at a battle-field, found the ground after a lapse of years had turned
so completely round, that the French, by some strange freak of nature,
were always on the side of victory. But we are confident this will not be
the case at Salamanca, Vittoria, and other places, when Monsieur THIERs
goes over them. . His History, when it is published, will effectually put to
flight the absurd rumours that, we are sorry to say, are so much about
that Monsieur THIERs has been sent out by the English Government, to
prove the British troops did not win any battles of consequence in Spain,
in order to justify the apparently harsh treatment the officers of the
Peninsula have lately received from the Duke of WELLINgron.

HINTS TO EMIGRANTS.
T the present season of the year, Emigration sets in,
or rather sets out, in a strong tide towards the coast.
But these hints are chiefly designed for those Emi-
grants who, avoiding the older settlements of Mar-
gate or Ramsgate, prefer life in the Bush at Herne
Bay, or a sojourn in the back woods at the rear of
Broadstairs.
At Ramsgate and Margate civilization has driven
the natives to the heights—we mean their attics—
while the settlers from London have the privilege
of the prairies on the first pair, the natives being
satisfied with coin and a petty plunder of provisions,
which the apathy of their visitors enables them to
practise.
We shall, however, presume our Emigrant to be
A bound for the wild Bay of the deserted Herne,
and shall suppose him effecting the long dreary
passage of the wooden pier, whose rude construc-
tion presents a contrast to the absence of rudeness in the native porters,
who will offer to act the part of caniels, and carry your luggage over the
dreary desert.
pHEADFUL ENGounter witH THE NATIVEs.
we ought, perhaps, to have attended our Emigrant from the wharf,
but it is harály necessary to tell the traveller in these days to attach his
hat by a piece of string to his button-hole; for many a beaver has been
borne by a boisterous breeze on to the bosom of the billows, where it has
been “felt but not seen,” as the poet—with a hat probably running in his
head—beautifully expresses it.
Let us, however, quit this episode, and receive our emigrant at the
upper end of the Herne Bay Pier, where we shall find a tribe of natives
offering him the hospitality
of their wigwams. The only T-
formidable tribe, however,
is that of the great touting
man, who can sometimes
only be beaten off by the
ONE PolicEMAN, who is an
object of terror even to the
wildest of the aborigines.
The Emigrant, as he gets
more inland, will be struck
by the mildness of the peo-
ple, and when he passes the
great potato districts, in
which the wealth of the
place entirely consists, he
will find himself among a
patriarchal people, who will
welcome him with smiles
and bows, but he must not
be too easily led away, or he
will be carried off to some
remote nook quite out of the
pale of social intercourse.
The Emigrant to Herne
Bay will not be under the
necessity of building himself
a mud hut, for the natives,
in their child-like simplicity,
seeing the art of building
practised by some strangers
who came to their shores, have followed the example to such an extent
. large masses of brick-work are studded, all over the uninhabited
istrict. -
The Broadstairs back-woodsman will, however, do well to go prepared
with the means of lodging himself in some temporarily constructed hut,
for the smallness of the station as a resort for emigrants often renders it
so crowded, that there is difficulty in finding shelter. Some take refuge
in the bathing-machines, which stand on the beach and which are let out
by the night at the same price as bedrooms, with the use of a small

REPEALERS AT. FAULT.
MR. O'Connell has addressed a letter to his dear Ray, commencing
with the following intimation:—
“My DEAR RAY, “Derrynane Abbey, Sept. 5.
“I send you inclosed the September instalment of Repeal Rent, as
follows.”
The learned Agitator then does the annexed little addition sum :-
“DANIEL O'Connell, M.P. - - . . £1 0 0
MAURice O'Connell, M.P. - - . 1 0 0
John O'Connell, M.P. - - . . 1 0 0
DANIEL O'Connell, Junior - - . 1 0 0
ºf 0 0°
MR. O'Connell, we presume, is desirous of setting a good example to
the landlords of Ireland, by returning a portion of his rent. He does
not, to be sure, take off a very large per-centage; but a crumb—not to
say half a loaf-is better to hungry Repealers than no bread. The
Derrynane manifesto concludes with a reference to the writer's hunting
pursuits, and a complaint that the scent would not lie; so that “his
excellent pack” were for the first time totally defeated.
As the affairs of MR. O'Connell's kennel can hardly be of any interest
even to the frequenters of Conciliation Hall, we cannot but conclude that
this complaint is figurative. “Well, all we can say is, that we are very
glad to hear it; and we hope, for the prosperity of the United Kingdom,
that the “pack” of MR. DANIEL O'Connell may indeed be totally
defeated.
T H E M O N S T E R H O U S E.
It is rumoured that the Railway King has taken one of those enormous
|masses of brick-work at the Albert Gate, as his future London residence.
We always thought them utterly uninhabitable, on account of the diffi-
culty of getting from floor to floor ; but MR. Hudson evidently sees that
by a well-digested plan of railway communication, the remote drawing-
room may be brought into connection with the distant kitchen, and even
the inaccessible attic may be linked by a network of iron with the far-off
pantry. The only difficulty which we can see at present arises from the
necessary steepness of the gradients; but with such engineering ingenuity
as the Railway King can command, he will no doubt be able to overcome
the obstacle.
The electric telegraph will be carried throughout in lieu of bells, and
the width of the staircase will allow of the broad gauge being adopted.
The atmospheric principle will be applied to the carrying of the smoke up
the chimneys, and a third-class train will leave the attic station every
morning, to convey the servants to the different places where they are
wanted to attend to their duties. There will be a nursery train at eight
for the children, a female train for the women-servants at ten, and a male
train for the men at eleven, to reach their bed-rooms at a reasonable hour.
The hall-porter will have an express train waiting for him at the final
close of the mansion.

A n O DE TO J O IN WIL I, E.
WHEN Victoria, Britain's Queen,
Was expected at Tréport,
There stood Joinville, grim of mien,
Smoking on the Gallic shore.
Cool, amid the courtly crowd,
Puff'd away the Royal tar;
Fast the fragrant, fleecy cloud
Blowing from his light cigar.
Joinville, free and easy Prince,
Terror of thy country's foes,
What a love thou dost evince
For the leaf Havannah grows'
Than in word, no less in deed,
Is it thy delight to fume,
That, of the Nicotian weed,
Such a deal thou dost consume 1
For one little volume thou
Didst, of vapour, once indite;
Myriads thou producest now,
Puffing thus from morn to might.
Still, brave Joinville, let thy steam
Off on thy paternal strand;
Let it not, though in a dream,
Waft thee to invade our land.
Bid all thoughts of conquest cease,
Say thy pamphlet was a joke;
Take the proffer'd pipe of peace,
And thy bluster end in smoke.
A PUFF FOR TOM THUMB.
THAT very veracious and most unequivocal print “French paper”
gives a long account of the capture and disappearance of ToM THUMB.
He has been kidnapped, it is “supposed,” by “four men in masks,” who,
it is believed, “belong to the band of ZENo.” For ourselves, we feel not
the slightest alarm about the General; and would advise the perturbed
public to console itself. ToM THUMB will appear again, no doubt, though
possibly an extra sixpence be added to the usual price of exhibition, in
consequence of the dangers he has undergone in the hands of “banditti.”
At all events, here is an opportunity for royalty and nobility to express
their sympathies with genius. The General has already received at the
hands of Queens and princes, watches, tooth-picks, and pencil-cases. Why
should not QUEEN Victoria—in her patronage of high art—present the
General with a diamond-hilted sword, to be used against future banditti
Why should not the QUEEN DowageR add to her gift of a repeater, the
more graceful cadeau of a tiny pair of hair-triggers?

BEULAH SPA, " ; ,
By “ PUNCH's” commissionER.
The nearest Wells, except those of Sadler or Bagnigge (which are too
near to Pentonville and Islington to require description for Londoners),
are, I believe, those comparatively modern Spas of Beulah, situated
apmong the pleasant hills of Norwood, and to be reached by a person
inhabiting the western end of the metropolis with not too much exertion.
Determined to examine these Wells, and averse to solitary travel, I
put myself in communication with my young friend, LieutenaNT RAw-
Bold, of the 75th Lancers—selecting that young fellow, not on account
of his conversational powers, which are small ; but rather because he
possesses an exceedingly well-regulated cab and horse, or, as he says
(in his clever facetious way), “the most hactionest hoss and the most
himpidintest tiger in the village of Lunding.” In this vehicle we made
our way to the Spa in question.
The purlieus of London are not to be described. The mind sickens in
recalling the odious particulars of the immediate neighbourhood of the
bridges. The hucksters and Jew furniture-shops, the enormous tawdry
gin-palaces, and those awful little by-lanes, of two-storied tenements,
where patent mangles are to let—where Miss MIFFin, milliner, lives on
the first-floor (her trade being symbolised by a staring pasteboard dummy
in a cap of fly-blown silver paper)—where the street is encumbered by
oyster-shells and black puddles, and little children playing in them. All
these we passed : likewise grim-looking Methodist chapels, and schools,
churches, and asylums innumerable. But the road has possibly been
travelled by my indulgent readers.
I perceived that the persons at the turnpikes were facetiously inclined.
A species of jokes passed between them and Augustus FREDERic,
RAwbold's groom, who was clinging on behind like a spread-eagle.
You emerge from the horrid road at length on a greenish spot, which
I am led to believe is called Kennington Common; and henceforward the
route becomes far more agreeable. Placid villas of cockneys adorn each
side of the road—stock-brokers, sugar-bakers—that sort of people. We
saw cruelty-vans (I mean those odious double-barrelled gigs, so injurious
to horse-flesh) lined with stout females with ringlets, bustles, and varie-
gated parasols. The leading stout female of the party drove the carriage,
(jerking and bumping the reins most ludicrously, and giving the fat horse
the queerest little cuts with the whip); a fat boy, resplendent in buttons,
commonly occupied the rumble, with many children : in some cases I
remarked that disguised footboys, habited in a half-coachman's dress,
drove the vehicle. I presume that Augustus FREDERic, our Spread-
Eagle, must have made signals of various kinds to these persons from
behind ; for I perceived various expressions of indignation or wonder in
the persons' countenances as we passed their singular equipages.
In this cockney villa district I observed that the country was almost
tenanted by women. All the people walking were women, except young
stock-brokers in the arms of nursery-maids; or occasional pages following
young ladies; or the doctor's boy ringing at some willa gate; or the blue-
clad butcherling arriving with the fillet of veal. The men are absent in
enormous, smoking London—'tis only with sunset that they come back to
their families and the fillet of veal.
The willas give each other the hand all the way up Camden Hill, Den-
mark Hill, &c.; one acacia leans over to another in his neighbour's wall;
Dobbs's bell-pull runs cheek by jowl with Hobbs's; one willa is just like
another; and there is no intermission in the comfortable chain. But by
the time you reach Norwood, an actual country is to be viewed by
glimpses—a country so beautiful that I have seen nothing more charming
—no, not in France, nor in Spain, nor in Italy, nor in the novels of
MR. JAMEs.
I had pictured to myself a watering-place like Ems or Wiesbaden, fre-
quented by a number of agreeable ladies and gentlemen; woods, water-
falls, pic-nics, donkey excursions, and waltzing on the grass with lovely
young ladies; a little enlivenment of roulette in the evenings; a battue,
perhaps, in the covers when the pheasant-shooting came; and about a
thousand people meeting every morning at the Spa-the majority of them,
of course, handsome women. In fact, I had stated such to be the case
to my young friend RAwBold, as we drove down.
We entered a lodge in the Swiss style ; and here a gentleman de-
manded a shilling from us before we were free of the Spa. “Is there
a great deal of company staying at the Spa 2" says I. “Tol lol,” says he,
and motioned us into the gardens.

self quite good-humouredly in the jocu-
heart, and, methinks, be supremely happy. But the company we saw
were,
Three trumpeters dressed in green, blowing Sunila tromba out of
a canvas arbour—a most melancholy obligato ;
A snuffy little old gentleman, with two grandsons—one a blue-coat
boy. His yellow stockings glittered like buttercups on the
sunshiny grass ;
A professional gipsy in a dark
walk ;
And two pretty servant-maids car-
rying a small basket, and on
the look-out for their Masters
and Missusses, who were
straying in some part of this
Elysium.
When the trumpeters had done, a
poor old wizened, grinning, good-natured
Italian, dressed up with a hat and pea-
cock's feathers—very like the monkey
that accompanies the barrel-organ–
came up and began warbling, in rather
a sweet feeble voice, the most seedy old
songs.
There was something ludicrously sad
in that honest creature's face. He didn't
mind being laughed at, but joined him-
larity. At night, he says, he takes off
those gimcracks, and walks the streets
like another Christian. To have seen
Harlequin in the daylight is something.
RAwbold, and even Augustus FREDERic,
who had put up the cab by this time
and joined us, gave him moneys—not
for singing, but for looking so unutter-
ably and pathetically comical. Do like-
wise, O benevolent reader, if thou recognisest the Troubadour of Beulah.
Then we strayed through shrubberies and rose-gardens until we came
to an archery-ground. Targets were set up, just, for all the world, as in
Ivanhoe—and a fellow in Lincoln-green came forward and invited us to
the Butts. I challenged Rawbold to a contest, and shot—with what success
and the odious fellow in
RAwbold hit no better :
Lincoln-green sneered all the while. “It isn't the harrows that's bad,” said
he sardonically, laughing at our complaints—“ they're good enough to
shoot with.”
“Can you shoot with them P” says RAwbold, piqued.
“I should think I could,” replied LINcoLN GREEN.—and, rather to his

discomfiture, we called upon him to do so. He levelled his arrow ; he
bent and twiddled with his bow previous to stringing it; he lifted up to
the sight-mark and brought it down; he put himself into an attitude so
prodigiously correct, that we thought the bull's-eye might as well shut up
at once, for he was sure to hit it. We looked at one another, as much as
to say, “What a tremendous Sagittarius of a fellow this Lincoln Green
one is 1” At last, whizz! the arrow went.
It missed. The old humbug could no more shoot than we could. He
took twelve shots at the target, and didn't hit once. “There are many
Lincoln Green ones in the world,” I said, (apostrophising young
Augustus FREDER1c); “fellows who pretend to do everything, and
whom everybody believes, because they brag so. Take warning by
yon pseudo-toxophilite, and be modest in all your dealings, my little
man.”
And so we left the archery-ground, with the most undisguised contempt.
No new company had arrived at the Spa during our brief absence. The
little old man was still sunning and snuffing himself on his bench. The
Blue-coat boy and his companion were still clambering over rustic arch-
ways. The two servant-maids had found Master and Missus, and were
spreading out a cloth in an arbour.
We thought they might be going to dine—but not so. They produced
from the basket a loaf, hot—though, no doubt, stale; some butter in an
almost melting state; some perspiring shrimps—and a screw of tea. I
suppose they took the Spa water for tea. The band began to blow when
this banquet was served—the poor minstrel came up, leering and grinning
with his guitar, ready to perform for them—they and we were the only
guests of the place—the solitude was intense. We left them there, of
a gorgeous summer afternoon, drinking tea and eating shrimps in the
sunshine. + + +- + + + +
THE DRAMA.
Report of the Managers of Sadler's Wells for the Diffusion
of Shakspereanity,
“Śbemati),—That we (the undersigned and company,) have
laboured in the good cause, here, near “ Islington-ponds, for almost
two years. That on our taking Sadler's Wells, (which the Poet BUNN,
in the heat of his inspiration, classified with a pot-house,) the natives
of the immediate neighbourhood and surrounding villages were in a
lamentable state of darkness as to the existence and humanising
purposes of WILLIAM SHAKspenE.
“That, for the most part, the natives had been accustomed to the
barbarous practices of the most barbarous melodramas: that they
were very frequent in their untimely cries for “Hot Codlins:’ that
they were prone to call for ‘Jim Crow, and ‘Jim along Josey,'
and other outpourings of savage life: that they looked upon blue
and red-fire as the brightest blaze of intellectual triumph (poet
BUNN again), and whenever it happened that an actor indulged in
imaginative reflections to the postponement of a combat or a clog-
hornpipe, they (the natives) would not hesitate to command the
aforesaid actor to “cut it short.’
“That what was called real water—which had all the startling
effect of a puddle of pale ink—had been for generations the prime
amusement of the natives: and that then the only way to insure the
run of a piece was to wet it well at the end.
“The undersigned have now the liveliest pleasure in testifying to
the improved civilisation of the natives of Islington and of the
surrounding villages.
“They (the natives) are very constant in their attendance at
Sadler's Wells to listen to SHARs PERE : they are, moreover, very
attentive, and seemingly much edified by what they come to witness.
“There has been no demand for “Hot Codlins.’ The savage yell
for ‘Jim Crow’ and “Jim along Josey, is never heard (the
gallery never mentions 'em). But—it is a pleasing fact for the lover
of the pure drama to contemplate—“To be or not to be, and solilo-
quies of like length and import, are nightly listened through with the
profoundest attention, and at the end rewarded with the most dis-
criminating applause. “Cut it short, is now cut altogether.
“The tank has been abolished; but the very best real water—the
small tear of sensibility at the poet’s moving story, illustrated by the
actor—has been abundant in all parts of the house.
“Further, the night charges at the various police-stations of the
neighbourhood have sensibly diminished ; and men—before con-
sidered irredeemable bacchanals—are now nightly known to bring
their wives and little ones to listen to the solemn and sportive truths
of SHARspERE, in the pit and gallery.

BEFoRE THE SESSION.
AFTER T lie SEStion.
The excessive sufferings of the M.P.'s who have sat on Railway Com-
mittees are such that they have wasted not only their time, but their
bodies. MR. Wakley, the Coroner, who says he has left half of himself in
the Isle of Sky, on account of the exercise he has taken there, must be a
man of substance, compared with the dwindled M.P.'s, who have been
gradually worn down to semi-skeletons. If SIR. R. PEEL goes on inflicting
such labours on the members, he will have nothick-and-thin supporters, for
all will be thin who support his Government. The above portraits of a
Committee-man before and after the session is a melancholy instance of
reduced M.P.'s who are brought down, like damaged goods, nearly one-
half by the alarming sacrifice.
SOWEREIGNS AT LOGGERHEADS.
Hades (from the Ghost of our own Reporter).
THINGs are in a dreadfully disturbed state in our world here...The
announcement that it had been determined to erect statues of the Kings
of England in your new houses of Parliament, has thrown an apple of
contention into our pleasant little community. -
A month ago, the harmony that prevailed was delightful. You might
have seen Hºnoid and WILLIAM THE Norman cracking a social cup of
hippocras, and helping each other to boar's head and cygnet with the best
grace in the world. HENRY THE Fourth, who had resumed his title of
Duke of LancasTER, after making the most ample apologies to Richard
THE Second, has for centuries past striven, by constant attention to that
rather weak monarch, to repair his unhandsome treatment of him in
Pomfret Castle. HENRY THE Sixth and Edward THE Fourth (whose
continual quarrels over their social game of cribbage led to our sending
them to Coventry for a long time,) had patched up a hollow place, and
were, at all events, civil to each other. Richard THE THIRD (who is by
no means the disagreeable person that SHAKSPEARE has represented him.)
had expressed his contrition to poor little Edward THE FIFTH, and the
boy used to say he was rather obliged to his uncle for easing his young
brows of a crown that would probably have caused him many a head-ache;
while Charles the First, who has ſong got over his antipathy to tobacco,
might have been seen blowing a social cloud and discussing abstruse
points of dogmatic theology, with CRomwell, whose bluff, soldier-like
manners had made him rather unpopular. William THE Third had
seriously set about converting JAMEs. The Second to low Church views in
religion, and constitutional principles in politics, and with good prospects
of success.
Now all is changed. Since this unlucky gallery of Royal personages
was projected, they have taken to discussing their respective claims to the
throne, and private characters; which, between ourselves, is ticklish ground
for most of them : de jure and de facto are ringing in our ears-you can't
take a walk without being dazzled by huge placards, such as-
“HAROLD and the Saxon Line.”
“Wote for WILLIAM THE Norman and the strong hand l’”
“Who killed Richarad The THIRD !”
“Edward THE FourTH begs respectfully to state that he has no
connection with the rival branch over the way.”
JAMES THE SEcond has declared his intention of bringing an action of
ejectment against WILLIAM THE THIRD, and of suing him for the mesne
profits; while WILLIAM, on his part, retorts, with the most unmeasured
denunciations of Popery, in the public prints,
CRomwell has hitherto taken but little part in the quarrel, although
CHARLEs the FIRST has resumed all the awkward stiffness of his manner
towards him, and the smoking parties have long been abandoned.
FURTHER PARTICULARs.
A coalition has taken place. By some extraordinary management on
the part of several historians, who have been admitted to the Royal
dinner-table, all the conflicting parties have been reconciled to each
other; and each consents tacitly to admit his rival's claim to a statue,
with one exception. All the crowned heads have turned fiercely against
poor old CRomwell, who sits quietly, with a grim calmness in his bluff,
stern face, and puckers his wart into a smile, as the storm beats upon him
from all quarters. It has been voted, mem. con., that he is to be excluded.
The only tenable ground for this, is the fact that he never assumed the name
of King, but has “Protector” on his cards. It seems generally agreed
that the want of polish in his manners, and a theoretical preference for
republican opinions, had created a prejudice against him in certain
quarters, which has been taken advantage of.
I was speaking to the old gentleman (who is very affable) a few days
ago. “It don't matter a brass farthing to me,” was his reply, when
I condoled with him on the scurvy treatment he had met with. “Till
they can blot my name out of the book of the History of England, the
world will know there was a man CROMwell, who stepped in between a
despot and a debauchee; and as for the statue, I never was over-fond of
graven images. ... I'm not squeamish about the company I keep, and I’ve
always treated CHARLEs with respect down here; but, if it comes to a
question of private feeling, I’d rather not stand on a pedestal between
him and his precious imp of darkness. And for the matter of that, I can
tell those gentlemen with the crowns on, overyonder, (and he pointed with
his pipe,) that I never knew a set of more disreputable fellows in my life ;
and some of my Ironsides were no great things to boast of in the way of
character.” -
After this unusually long and coherent speech, the old soldier resumed
his pipe, with a grunt ; and I left him, looking as sour as if WANE had just
treated him to a dose of Fifth-Monarchy enthusiasm.
P.S.—The following placard has just been issued from the committee-
W.” the “Society for the Promotion of Pure Royalty all over the
orld” :—
“We, the undersigned, Kings of England, de jure or de facto, or other-
wise, beg to state, that we consider ourselves Kings of England
in the true and proper sense of the word ; and that we have
unanimously agreed, that one Oliver CRomwell, having for
some time sat at our table, on sufferance, as one of ourselves, the
said OLIVER Choatwell had no just right and title to such place
amongst us; and we do, individually and collectively, declare
our opinion that the said Olived Caoxiwell, being a person of
rude and ungentlemanlike habits, and having been guilty of a
gross act of personal violence to CHARLEs STUART, one of our
body, we hereby exclude the said Oliver Cnomwell from our
royal mess.”
(Signed) Here follow the Royal Signatures.
A Good Prospect for the Theatres.
THE Worcester Journal talks of a new kind of wheat, which has been
grown with the greatest success in that neighbourhood. It is called
the “BURLETTA WHEAT.” This has created quite a sensation in theatrical
circles, and we may consequently expect a tolerable crop of Burlettas
about Christmas, that being the harvest-time of the year with all the
theatres. We understand MR. WEBSTER has a sample of this wheat
already planted in his green-room in the Haymarket. It is growing
on rather a small plot, but is expected, if not forced too much, to fill in
a very short time the whole theatre. This wheat requires a generous
soil to bring it to perfection, and a very severe drilling is necessary
sometimes to make it stand at all, for it does not thrive equally well in
all theatrical climates. It belongs to the class of tender annuals, though
it has been known in some instances to bear fruit twice a year. When
it does take root in a theatre, it is impossible to calculate the number
of pounds a manager will bag from it in one season. It makes a most
delicious kind of bread, that managers and actors are very fond of.
The SMALLEST IMPROVEMENT THANKFULLY RECEIVED.
THE difficulty, it seems, with railways is to invent a whistle that shall
give intimation to another train of approaching danger. We are sure
the public would be too grateful for any improvement of the kind, espe-
cially as they now find that, if they lose their lives on a pleasure excursion,
it is paying rather too dearly for their whistle.

PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
An intoxicating beverage, and, as a
great promoter of political discus-
sion, entitled to a place in a political
dictionary. Some of the finest feel-
ings of patriotism have had their
birth in a glass of ale. CRomwell.
is said to have drunk in his first
draught of political inspiration from
an ale-barrel in his father's brewery
at Huntingdon.
ALEHouses have been the subject
of much legislative bad spelling,
including a statute against “vaca-
bounds and beggers,” passed in the
reign of HENRY THE SEven TH,
and an act in the same anti-ortho-
graphical reign, to “rejecte and put
and places where they shall think
convenyente.” Several Parliaments
dabbled slightly in beer by passing
acts regarding it, but they were all superseded in 1828 by one new
statute. By this the sale of beer requires a license, but it is doubtful
whether the proprietors of Vauxhall Gardens might not claim a
prescriptive right to deal in heavy wet, whenever they open their
establishment.
ALIEN. A person born out of allegiance to the ruling power where
he resides; as, if I am born in Fleet Street, of City parents, I should
be an alien to the West End if I went to reside there at any future
period.
ALLEGIANCE. A debt to the Sovereign that everybody owes, and
from which nobody can discharge himself. Allegiance is due to
usurpers as well as to legitimate monarchs, and would seem therefore
to have been payable to the lunatic who used to jump up on to one
of the benches in St. James's Park, and proclaim himself King of
England, until a policeman walked him off to a very inferior station.
ALLoTMENT SystEM. The practice of allotting little bits of
ground to agricultural labourers to diminish their grounds of com-
plaint, and by employing them on small plots of earth preventing
them from entering on plots of a more dangerous character. The
system is said to have worked well, and the labourers have worked
well, wherever it has been adopted.
ALMon ER. An officer formerly kept in a prince's, prelate's, or other
great man's household, to distribute alms to the poor. We need
hardly say that such an officer has, in these days, become obsolete as
a regular member of a royal, episcopal, or aristocratic establishment.
The word Almoner is said to be a corruption of eleemosynarius; and
such has been the corruption, that the office has almost entirely
decayed. There is still a lord high almoner, whose duties have
dwindled down to the distribution of fourpenny bits, twopenny
twists, and quarts of half-and-half to a few very old people on
Maundy Thursday.
AMBAssador. A sort of ticket-porter, by whom messages and
parcels are carefully delivered from one sovereign to another. An
ambassador must furnish his countrymen with passports and pro-
tection; so that he is not only a porter, but a policeman as well, for
he must defend those who apply to him for assistance, and enable
them to “move on ” when travelling. : An ambassador is called
“his Excellence,” though he may excel in nothing but short whist
and diplomatic cunning. An ambassador is free from all process, so
that, after dealing with tradesmen to a large extent, he may cut, or
play any other odd trick that a Jack-in-office, if he happens to be a
knave, would disgrace himself by practising.
AMENDMENT. A word sometimes applied to the tinkering of an
Act of Parliament. It is called amendment from the Greek a, which
signifies not; and mendment, which is the old Saxon term for
mending.
Signs of the Times.
Two large Stags have been put up at the Albert Gate. This is a quiet
bit of satire which we should like to see more generally adopted in our
public buildings. Since we are on the head of Stags, we take this oppor-
tunity of contradicting a rumour that has been too much about, of a new
order of merit being instituted in England, to be called “The Royal Order
of the Stag” We are glad to state that the institution of it has been
deferred, in obedience to HER MAJESTY's wishes, until further orders.

authorities of Holy-
well Street, who are
very desirous that
the next annual

place in that vene-
rable quarter.
There certainly
could scarcely be
a more appropriate locality for continuing the sort of researches in which
the Archaeologians are occupied. They only unrol a mummy on account of
the number of its coats and the length of time they have been worn ; so
that Holywell Street must present a rich repast, in the way of old clothes,
to the archaeological enthusiast. The interest attaching to barrows must be
intensely gratified by a visit to Holywell Street, for it is calculated that
it is daily visited by an immense number of barrows of every size and
description. The opening of a cat's-meat barrow takes place every
morning at about ten, and the Archaeologians would have an opportunity
of seeing the effect produced by the operation on the numerous feline
creatures in the neighbourhood; thus combining a lesson in Natural
History with the other ordinary pursuits of the Association.
We have been told that the President has promised to read a paper on
the use of the term “Old Clo’,” in the Mosaic aera; and a member of one
of the sections will give a lecture on a gorget of mail, and a coat of a
mail guard, both in the possession of MR. SolomoNs. Some rolls of
papyrus, sold for waste paper, will also be unrolled at a General Meeting;
and MR. Foss will read an essay on the Coptic Roll as compared
with the French Roll, illustrating his remarks by eating the crust,
and other ingenious experiments. MR. SAMUELs will throw open the
whole of his warehouse to the members, and has promised to exhibit a
series of shoes, from the early highlow of our elder brothers, to the
Clarence of the present aera. He will also give a pair of Bluchers and a
pair of Wellingtons for the best and the worst paper on the Battle of
Waterloo, in which the characteristics of a Blucher and a Wellington
are to be pointed out, in relation to the shoe-trade, for the purpose of
showing how England maintained her footing.

It seems that the Experimental Squadron has been under the command of an officer whose
gallantry has had to struggle with the gout, and whose head and heart have been ready to
achieve wonders which his hand and foot have been unable to execute. Valour has been
in his breast, but gout has invaded his great toe, and his noble captains have all been
crawling about the Experimental Squadron in the same ignoble predicament.
Gruel has superseded grog at the officers' mess, and the ships' stores have comprised
flannel wrappers for the legs of the gallant fellows—to prevent their timbers from
shivering. REAR-ADMIRAL, Hyde PARKER has, it is said, been a martyr to the gout during
the whole cruise, and has been confined to his hammock for half the time, so that he has
been obliged to carry on his observations through a telescope lashed over his eye, and
carried up through the gangway to the rigging.
That enthusiastic old boy, the second lieutenant, has swallowed pills by the handful,
expecting to realise the celebrated “ha 1 ha 1 cured in an instant; " but the attempt to
throw away his crutches and start to his feet has terminated in his falling down exhausted
| abaft the binnacle. The Admiral is, we are told, to have a Bath chair, in which he is to
be wheeled about the deck, in case of his being sent on another cruise, and the subordinate
officers are to be allowed to add a pair of crutches and a Welsh wig to the regular naval

inspection, it turned out that a balloon had been attached
to an effigy of one of the force, who was thus raised
above his own station.
As ballooning is now popular, we recommend the pro-
prietors of Vauxhall Gardens to bring up their season
with a wet sail—by-the-bye, it is sure to be wet if they
have anything to do with it—and to start a number of

announcement that the Monster Ministers were about to

NEPTUNE, if he does not play a tremendous knife and fork,
takes it into his head to gulp down a cliff or two, he
shows himself possessed of an awful swallow. If his is
not the devouring element, it is not far short of it, when
he makes up his mind to a feast ; and we are told he has
just gulped down twelve acres of cliff at Cromer. He

3Buntº's Nabal Intelligente.
T appears that considerable promotion has
taken place in the Thames Navy, on
account of the launching of several
new vessels. STEERsMAN TIMKINs relin-
quishes the helm of the Daisy to StokeR
JoNEs of the Crocus, and TIMKINs
obtains a captaincy in the Ant, with a
seat on the paddle-box. The commis-
sioning of the Bee has caused a brevet
in the Iron Steamboat Company, and
the steward of the Atalanta takes the
command of the crew of the Fairy for
an experimental voyage.
We regret to have to record the
particulars of a mutiny which broke
out on Saturday last on board the
- Niobe, as she lay in the offing opposite
the Steam Pier at London Bridge. The gallant captain had given the word
to “let go” somewhat hastily, and as the operation was not performed,
he repeated the command with an oath ; when the middy—an irritable
old man of seventy—to whom the word had been given, took offence at
the irascibility of the Captain, and exclaiming, “Let go yourself,” walked
away to the back of the vessel. The Captain of the Niobe instantly saw
that it was useless to make a stand against the mutinous spirit of the crew,
for the stoker had been heard to echo, “Ah, let go yourself,” and an
approving wink from the man at the helm made it obvious that insubordi-
nation, like a monstrous serpent, had coiled itself in the very ropes round
the whole vessel from her stem to her stern, and, in fact, sunk into her
hold, and twined round her funnel. The gallant commander consequently
descended from the paddle-box, and folded his arms as if waiting for the
worst, which immediately appeared in the shape of a director, at the sight
of whom the captain skipped up to his place, while the man who had
refused to “let go” instantly resumed his duties. The stoker set loyally
to work, and the spirit of mutiny, which had a moment before been ram-
pant, had disappeared from the vessel.
We made some remarks the other day on the difficulty in finding
names for the new steamboats in the above-bridge navy. We understand
that the Niobe is so called, because, like Niobe, it is “all tears,” from the
steam continually dropping in large, big, pearly drops on to the heads of
the passengers.
WORKHOUSE COOKERY.
The disclosures in the Andover Union have thrown quite a new light
on the science of Cookery, which not even the inspiration of a Soyer
could have hit upon. That ingenious chef de cuisine has blended together
poetry, pastry, and politics, with considerable skill; he has invented a
|creme d’Angleterre, consisting of charms borrowed from the female
aristocracy; but those ingredients, imaginary and unsubstantial as they are,
must be considered as solids when compared with the materials used for
constituting the dishes served up to the paupers in the Andover Union.
Butter, according to New Poor-Law Cookery, is made from the skimmings
of grease-pots, and parochial tea is made from boiling old leaves which
have already had their strength drawn out of them. A new Cookery-
| Book, edited by MAcDougal, the master of the Andover Union, is
evidently a desideratum in culinary literature, which even M. SoYER's
universal genius has hitherto left unsupplied.
A PRO OF READY MADE.
The latest piece of legislation of Lord Brough AM is entitled, “An Act
to render the Assignment of Satisfied Terms unnecessary.” For instance,
LoRD BRough AM is on such satisfied terms with himself, that any assign-

It is very unpleasant to get up at ten o'clock in the morning, and shave
before noon. I suppose there are some people who are compelled to rise
at eight, but I am sure I feel the most sovereign contempt for them.
There is one great disadvantage in keeping coal-mines. The constant
bother of looking over accounts, and signing mortgages, exposes one to a
thousand sources of ennui, for which no profits, however large, can be an
adequate compensation.
How debased must be that man who would travel without his batterie

The peasants in France kneel down in the churches on the stone-pave-
ment. After this, who can wonder at the atrocities of the French Revo-
lution ?
The man who would not make way for a Lord, or give up his bed to a
Duke, deserves being transported; but the man who would present a, bill
to either is a fiend who would be capable of any atrocity, and for whom
no punishment can be too severe.
I wonder how people can eat, or drink, or sleep in the German hotels.
Everything is so bad, so filthy, and so high-priced, that it is a wonder to
me how any one can exist a day under it. Wilſit be believed—they charged
me at Vienna fourpence for a small cup of coffee? I told the landlord I
should mention it in my book, and the impudent fellow actually laughed
in my face | -
If there is a man in existence equal to RobespierRE, it is the English
Ambassador at Constantinople. I left my card upon him, and he never
invited me to dinner. No wonder the interests of England are so often
sacrificed abroad 1
The number of English you meet with on the Continent is positively
annoying. They are to be met with everywhere—in the coaches, in the
hotels, in the streets, in the churches and theatres,-not a place, however
common or beautiful, is sacred from their intrusion. I shall certainly
make a motion next session in the House of Lords, that every English-
man be compelled to stop at home and mind his shop.

I spoke
THE BACCHOMETER;
A New INvenTION, with some Description of THE working MoDEL.
ood MR. PUNCH,
“They say necessity is the mother of
invention. I don’t believe it: unless, indeed,
the family has run through several gene-
rations since the proverb was originated,
and so by this time old Necessity may be
only some very distant ancestor of modern
discovery. Now-a-days, I'm sure, new in-
ventions are like mile-stones—neither here
nor there — and the ingenuity of their
# authors is inconsiderable, compared to the
# frantic exertions of a perplexed public in its
#l hopeless attempts to make any possible use
* of the blessings of science.
“But, my Punch, I have discovered
an invention, , a use for which happily
existed coevally with NoAH, and considerably before cork-screws—an
invention which I have enjoyed myself for twenty years, and which I
now, being a person about to marry, make public for the same reason
that folks give for selling used-up horses—because I have no further
occasion for it. You have heard of the pedometer, Mr. Punch—an
ingenious instrument, which you put in your pocket to tell you how
far you go. Now I call my contrivance the Bacchometer: it tells you
how far you are gone. It is not exactly portable, consisting for the most
part of pumps, lamp-posts, and in extreme cases of the ordinary gutter.
But this is no drawback upon its applicability, which consists simply in
watching the various phases in which common street objects present
themselves to the vino-obnebulated imagination. The impressions so
deduced form a complete index to conviviality—a graduated scale of
excess. For example: the philosopher, whose duplicated vision on con-
sulting the Bacchometer fills him with the idea that he is a quadruped
provided with two latch-keys, may safely consider himself in a situation of
“How came you so while a posture of helpless horizontality, accompa-
nied by a sensation of a policeman feeling in his pocket for his card-case,
must needs convince him that the index of the instrument stands at ‘set
screwed.” By means of this judicious discovery, no man need hence-
forward blush for bottles when he has sinned only in glasses—no man
need have punch on his mind, when but humble negus is in his head.
For my own part, now, my criterion throughout my life has been my
knocker; and never, since I first took it to my bosom—I mean to my
front door—has it deceived me. One glance at its expressive bronze
after a jolly evening, and I can recal to a glass the a-la-Romaine I have
swallowed—can predict to a throb the head-ache of to-morrow.
“Permit me, Sir, to paint my knocker. It was (I say “was, because
my bride makes it a sine quá non that I discard it;
and, in fact, a new brass bell-pull, with ‘Visitors’
written under it, is already in agitation); it was,
to see it by day, but a simple specimen of Birming-
ham ingenuity. Its countenance, not perhaps strictly
handsome, was undeniably distingué; its eyes were
very wide open ; its cheek-bones (where the hinges
worked) prominent and intellectual; its chin, impos-
sible to a razor in any point of view, was greatly calcu-
lated for sound or fury. In common with all its family,
my knocker had no ears — I suppose, in merciful
consideration on the part of its founders, to protect
it against those instruments of torture which perform
the Polka in the fore-courts of Peckham during the
first twenty minutes of breakfast-time, and then, adding
insult to injury, strike up—“We may be happy yet.'
“But to see that knocker after a cigar and a comic
song at Evans's, or any other equally “late joys!'
How genially it showed its metal then How its
dimpled mouth would pucker with enjoyment as it
smoked my Woodville. How would it seem to wink
with jovial slyness at my latch-key (oily superseder of
its functions as it was 1) as much as to say to me,
• Hal haſ you sad dog, you. Ha! haſ MRs. MANGLETop
and the children. Ha 1 haſ been a-bed these three
hours. Ha! haſ too bad—shiver me !’
“But, to be candid with you, my knocker was not always convivial; it
could be austere. I admit with shame, my Punch, that I have now and
then been vaguely returning homeward at that
nocturnal solstice, when one is at a loss to know
whether it is very early or very late—in the morn-
ing. I have been painfully endeavouring to palliate
my own blushes. I have wished to keep it dark
to myself an hour or two after sunrise, when, being
let in along with the sweeps, I have encountered the
glances of my knocker. Had I, Punch, instead of it
—had I had cheeks of iron, I give you my honour
that gaze would have made me blush through my
black-lead.
“I have done. Yet, while the nib of immortality
still trickles over my departing knocker, let me
exonerate myself from any blind admiration of its
faculties. In the loftiest flights of my enthusiasm, I
could never shut my eyes to the rivets which bound
it on the inside of the door. Ah! my Punch, how
many great countenances there are in this world
bronzed |. to speak) with benevolence — counte-
nances which are wont to utter flowery sentiments
and smile capacious smiles — countenances before
which the world is but as one adoring audience;
and only, only because the world knows nothing
about the nuts and screws that clinch them on
the other side 1
“Yours very much,
“Young Peckham.”
National Sports.
ON the very same day that seven bulls were slaughtered before the
QUEEN of SPAIN, fifteen men were butchered in the streets of Madrid:
another proof that Spaniards are treated in their country like beasts, only
not half so well. The rate of exchange of human life in Spain seems to
be, l bull = 2 men. When are these national sports to cease ? Her
Spanish Majesty forgets that what may be very good sport to her is death
to others. She should be careful, for she is teaching her people one of
those games, at which, it is said, two can play. .
DECIDEDLY CRACKED.
A MoRNING paper talks of the ships of the Experimental Squadron as
being “crack vessels.” So many holes have been picked in them, since
their powers of sailing have been tested, that we are afraid they deserve
the compliment rather too literally. Even the Cove of Cork, where they
are at present floundering, must see through them

THE DISEASE IN THE POTATO.
WE understand that several of the potatoes are suffering from black
eyes, which particularly affect the champions, probably from their being
more pugnacious than those of a different kidney. . We understand that
some of the farmers having tried every other method in vain, have lately
resorted to GRIMstone's Eye Snuff, which they have dug in as a manure
in large quantities where bad eyes have been prevalent in the potato crop.
We have seen one or two testimonials from influential members of the
Murphy family, speaking in the highest terms of the snuff, and ordering
more of it. We give the following, in justice to MR. GRIMsToNE, to whom
it was addressed :-
“SIR,--I was taken at the beginning of last month with very bad
eyes, which became completely black, and I was given up as lost, when by
accident a friend let fall what I afterwards found to be a box of your
invaluable eye-snuff. - Now, sir, suffering as I was from my bad eyes, I
was glad of any remedy at a pinch, and I thought your snuff was not to
he sneezed at. For some time I felt no relief; but in about a week I
became so much better, that I am now out of my bed, and hope soon to
be presentable at the dinner-table. The cook, I am afraid, has a design
upon me, for I have just seen her scraping an acquaintance. It will be
my turn next; so I remain, while I can, -
- “Yours very truly,
- - “A. TATUR.”
It is a curious fact connected with the potato, that, though it is such an
every-day sort of plant, it has been frequently subject to disease, and it
suffered in 1764 from “the curl,” which is still a malady which the unhappy
vegetable is still sometimes a martyr to. We understand that the only
remedy for “the curl" is Rowland's Macassar Oil, which will take the
curl even out of a potato. -
** He was Locked Up.”
Who was locked up What was the culprit's sin against society
What iniquity had he-“a poor sickly boy, about fifteen years of age”–
committed, that the awful MR. CoMBE, sitting in his magisterial chair at
Clerkenwell, should punish the prisoner (who had not 2s. 6d. to pay a
fine) with hard captivity What, asks the moralist, was his evil-doing tº

had obstructed “the foot-path and carriage-way in Chapel Street, St.
Pancras, with his basket of fruit for sale !” The audacious malefactor
“with tears in his eyes, said he had no other way to live;” and the
offending, destitute wretch, was therefore—locked up !
ANOTHER NEW SFEC.
The Speculation Mania at present existing has extended from rail-
roads to rivers; and having almost run itself all over the dry land,
has at length plunged into the water. Steam for the Million at twopence
a head has been followed up by Steam for the Billion at one penny, and
a company is now being formed to supply Steam for the Quadrillion at
one halfpenny. We have been favoured with a sight of the prospectus,
from which we make an extract. The contemplated company is proposed
with the view of forming a series of canals to be carried on archways.
along the principal thoroughfares, making a sort of Grand Junction Tank,
to be supplied by the Grand Junction Water-works. Each house may
have a connection with the canal by means of the cistern, provided the
occupants of the premises will be at the expense of carrying their water
up to the level of the canal of the company. A number of small steamers
will be launched to ply throughout the principal streets of the metropolis,
and it is calculated that the superfluous steam from the London tea-kettles
may be so concentrated as to work the locomotives without any expense
to the company. The following is a list of the managing committee :-
Simon Swindle, Esq., Provisional Shareholder in the Moonlight.
Thomas SwiNgE, Esq., Chairman of the Lightning and Perpetual
Provisional Director of the Daisy.
SIR. Jones SMITH Jones, Director of the Cream of the Valley, and
Grand Middlesex Water-works Junction Company.
Hugh Hope, Esq., Deputy-chairman of the Bee, and uncle to one
of the Provisional Proprietors of the Ant.
MARMADUKE MonMouth, Esq., Mortgagee of the Polyanthus, and
Deputy Bill Discounter to the Daffydowndilly.
OUT OF PLACE.
An individual has advertised in the Times for “a permanent light
situation.” He had better inquire if the Sun is in want of a domestic ;
for as “permanent light” seems to be the advertiser's object, a place in
the Sun can be the only situation he is looking for.

The papers complain of the bad state of the roads in Spain. No

O
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DictionARY.
NARchy. The entire absence of government; as,
if the governor goes out for the day, the
children are left in a state of anarchy.
Persons living in anarchy are, as far as
politics are concerned, said to be in a state
of nature; but they soon get into such a
state of ill-nature, that it is found neces-
sary to place some control over them.
ANNALs, in Latin Annales, from Annus, a
year. Cicero tells us that it was the
custom for the Pont IFEx MAxIMUs to
write out the transactions of the past year,
for which he was paid ; so that the first
penny-a-liner was the Pont IFEx MAXIMUs.
These annals are said to have been a dry
statement of facts; but that incorrigible
punster, Aulus GELLIus, declares that, as
the Pontifex was compelled to hang the

tion of the people, the statement could not
have been dry in rainy weather.
APANAGE. The provision assigned by
the Kings of France to their younger sons.
Formerly the children of a deceased French
King divided the Crown between them ;
but as it was inconvenient that one should
wear the gold rim, another the ermine
border, a third the purple-velvet cap, the
four next the four crosses, leaving nothing
for the eighth child but to balance the
cross pattée as well as he could on the top
XA of his pole, the crown was made to descend
entire to the eldest. In 1790, it became the
law of France that no apanage should be granted to the younger
branches of the royal family, but that they should be boarded,
lodged, and done for, like other little folks, at the expense of their
parents, till they married or reached the age of twenty-five, when
they were to have an annual allowance. By a law of March, 1832,
it was decreed that the King's sons and daughters should have
nothing from the country till their papa was too poor to provide for
them. The KING of The FRENch has once or twice attempted to
get up a case of insolvency, as a plea for obtaining an allowance for
his children; but his petition has always been dismissed, and he has
been compelled to “dub up” out of his own pocket.
Apprestice, from apprendre, to learn. A term which is applied to
a barrister who is called an apprentice of the law, though he may
have learnt nothing of his profession. A man going to the bar pays
a fee to a special pleader for the run of his papers; but as some
special pleaders have no papers but the Times, which any one may
have the run of for twopence a day, it is hardly worth while paying
a hundred pounds premium for the privilege of reading in the
pleader's chambers. An ordinary London apprentice is bound by
indentures, and it is supposed the practice of thrashing an apprentice,
by which an indenture was made in his skin, gave rise to the
indenture being used as a symbol of the contract.
ARBITRATION. A mode of settling differences without the
expense of a law-suit, which is never resorted to until all the
expenses of the law-suit have been incurred, and the trial is about
to proceed ; when, if the case promises to be lengthy, and the
counsel have something to do in other courts, they recommend an
arbitration. An arbitrator is a kind of concentrated essence of
justice, combining in his own person the functions of a judge and
jury; turning his chambers, for the time being, into a Court, of
which his clerk, or boy, is the temporary usher. When the arbi-
trator has made his award, he seals it up, and it is “left till called
for ” at his chambers, where it sometimes lies for ever, as neither
party will be at the expense of coming for it. When this is the case,
the arbitrator is out of pocket for the stamp, and as he must not
show any soreness at the loss, he is compelled to struggle as he best
may between his interest and his dignity.
Amchive. A chamber where public papers are kept, so that
PEELE's Coffee House is one of the principal archives in the city
of London. The word archives, by a common figure, came to be
applied to the papers, on the same principle as that by which the
boy whose name was JEM came to be called GoLIAH for shortness.

modesty, has evidently forgotten a few matters. Why did he not also
inquire of “any gentleman’” with a furnished residence and coach-house,
the address of his tailor and wine-merchant, assuring him that “for an
equivalent” for whatever articles he might have of such tradesmen, there

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TESTIMONIALS TO MANAGERS.
If a man wants a service of plate, let him take a play-house.
Superficial libellers have called actors a selfish, race; how trium-
phantly, every six weeks at most, do they rebut the calumny It is
wonderful to see how green-room gratitude runs to the silversmith,
to pick out Épergnes, and salvers, and tea-and-coffee pots, for wise,
liberal, and paternal managers The head of the play-house, no matter
what sort of a head it may be, is always plated. The actors have so
much money in the way of salaries, that their pockets would
absolutely burst, if there was not a vent for them, every few weeks,
by the way of a subscription for some gold or silver “rich domestic
ornament” for the dear MR. or MRs. DAGGER wood who governs
them. MEssas. Cox AND SAvony, the particularly enterprising
silversmiths, have remarked this proneness to desperate liberality on
the part of players; and have therefore manufactured a great variety
of articles, to be presented (when subscribed for) in proper season to
the Managers and Manageresses of London. For the present, we
can only give three.
The first is a very handsome affair, and is worthy of the attention
of the folks of the Opera, when anxious—as next season they will
be—once again to mark their sense of the tremendous value of MR.
LUMLEY, the enthusiastic, tasteful, and munificent director. HER
GRAcious MAJESTY-the tutelary genius of everything that is not
English—is represented as the Lady in Comus, fixed, fascinated in her
royal chair, by the pas of a ballet-dancer. The execution is very
chaste, and the whole design beautifully embodies the spirit and
tendency of HER MAJESTY's patronage to the arts and sciences of
her native country.
As the Poet BUNN has commenced
another season, he will, of course—
(judge, MEssRs. Cox AND SAvony)—
have another testimonial at its conclu-
sion. Devoted JoHN Coopea was wont
to go round with the hat for the sub-
scriptions, but John being exiled from
Drury, we presume the grateful task
will devolve upon MR. HARLEY, whose
smiles will, we trust, be as efficacious
in extracting the shillings from the
chorus and ballet as were the blandish-
ments of his pains-taking predecessor.
The testimonial, it will be seen, has a
peculiar significance, and touchingly
illustrates the relative positions of the
Poet BUNN and the Poet SHAkspeaRE
at Drury-Lane Theatre.
The third testimonial has been ma-
nufactured in the lively expectation
that no very long time can now elapse
ere Miss WINcENT, or some other,
“acknowledged heroine of domestic
tragedy,” shall have her professional
reputation enshrined in frosted silver.
There is a mingled vigour and beauty in this design that proves
the artist to have caught the very spirit of the domestic drama, as
embodied by Miss VINCENT. She is evidently desiring some villain
“to tremble,” and further to remember that “there is an eye
above.”
-
W.
º
.
We have been favoured with a view of twenty other designs
executed to meet the merits of all managers. We were much struck
with the beauty of two German silver spittoons, intended to be pre-
sented by their grateful companies to “the sagacious, spirited, and
munificent managers” of the Eagle Saloon, and, also, of the Royal
Albert.
TEA AND TOAST.
ONE day last week the London Dock Company, at the opening of their
new range of tea-warehouses, gave a party to the Tea division of the
mercantile interest of London. The “usual toasts” were given on the
occasion; and though, no doubt, these toasts were, so to speak, buttered,
we believe that they were not exactly that description of toast which
is “usually given” at tea. On the health of Souchong being proposed,—
Souchong (through his representative) declared that he had never
risen—in the market or anywhere else—under circumstances so flattering
as the present. He had been often drunk; though he was never either
tipsy himself, nor the cause of intoxication in others; for his was the
draught that cheered but not inebriated. Around him were the
Merchant Princes of London; though he must regret the absence of one
who was at once a Merchant Prince and a Merchant Tailor. He felt that
he had now been on his legs long enough, and could only return his best
thanks for the honour that had been done him.
GUNPowder felt himself ready to explode with gratitude for the dis-
tinction which had just been conferred upon him. He hoped to continue
to give satisfaction—in a friendly way: he was not that gunpowder that
feared to be superseded by steam: he respected steam for its connection
with boiling water—which was his element. It was his boast to load the
caddies, and not the cannons, of his country. Allied, as he trusted ever to
be, with the milk of human kindness and the sugar of free labour, it
should ever be his aim to promote universal peace.
GREEN Hyson, in acknowledging the compliment that he had just
received, would notice with pride an epithet which had been applied to
him. He had been called evergreen: he felt thus associated with the
laurel ; and if the laurel bound the poet's temples, he had often to boast
of stimulating the poet's brain: he was aware that it had been insinuated
that he was hostile to the nervous system; this was a calumny, and he
took that public opportunity of making the assertion.
Young Hyson, after the eloquent speech just made by his brother,
would merely express his thanks.
speaking; his experience being limited to the silent spouting of the
kettle.
“The Genuine Leaf” having been proposed—
A STRANGER rose to respond. He claimed the appellation which had
just been mentioned : he was the BRITISH LEAF. (Indignant crics of
“ Turn him out !”)
A scene of indescribable confusion here ensued, amid which the pre-
tender was expelled from the room. Order having at length been
restored, harmony resumed her sway, and several sentimental and comic
songs having been sung, the company separated at an advanced hour.

A SEASONABLE WORD ON RAILWAYS.
BY MR. PUNCH.
T a dinner given by the Directors
of the Diddlesex Junction Rail-
way to one another out of the
funds of the Company — Fitz
JAMEs DE LA PLUchE, Esq.,
Chairman,—PUNch, Esq., Vice-
Chairman—the latter gentleman
delivered the following speech
in reply to a complimentary ora-
tion from the distinguished pre-
sident :—
“MR. Chairman AND GENTLEMEN,
“The manner in which you
have drunk my health is most gra-
tifying to me. I won't say that
“tears choke my utterance,’ as
O'Connel L did, upon a solemn
occasion, the other day. Humbug
and hypocrisy will not pass for
2 honest emotion in England: and
never can be welcome to honest
men. Gentlemen, I drink all your
good healths in return. (Cheers.)
“There was a talk last week of
an Order in Council to prohibit the
further issue of railroad prospec-
tuses, on the plea that there were
too many now on hand, and that it
was impossible for Parliament to
discuss those schemes already ex-
tant in the course of next session.
“Mr. Punch is inclined to be of the opinion of the Order in Council,
for various cogent reasons.
“In the first place—do we wish to be the death of the House of Com-
mons : If we work them with bills as we did last session, every one,
except a few of the tough ones, will expire. Fancy a House composed of
HUME and PEEL, for instance, whom nothing can kill—old Joe with his
stupid figures of arithmetic, and Bob with his incomparably stupider
figures of speech. (Sensation dans l'auditoire.)
“Secondly,–and this is even a more important reason than the former
—although some of you, my dear brethren, don't care a jot whether the
House of Commons is dead or alive, yet your own interests will probably
affect you sincerely. Men and Shareholders, you have already signed
your deeds, pocketed your premiums, and (the scheme being agreed to
by Parliament) committed yourselves to the finishing of your respective
undertakings within a certain space of say three years.
“Look, my dears, at the number of schemes now on the list I can't
stop to count them—I can't tell the number of deeds I myself have signed
—(hear, hear,)—the number of applications I myself have made— (Great
applause)—but O, my dear brother-shareholders, which among you will not
agree with me, that there is as much money to pay as this great country
can conveniently fork out: that there is as much to do as our labourers
possibly can do: and that it will be well to get that done before we engage
ourselves farther ?
“Parliament binds you to execute your contracts in a certain short
period of years, or months almost. You must have the iron in that time,
and do you think the iron masters will spare you? You must have the
labour performed, and where are the hands to do it? Workmen will be
in such request for the next three years, that the best profession for
younger sons will be the pickaxe and shovel. Navies may dictate their
own terms—at least, until the Companies are bankrupt, when there will
be no labour, nor wages, nor railroads at all. It will be a sad day when
capitalists, and iron masters, and workmen, sit looking at each other after
the general smash that our haste for speculation has occasioned. (Profound
attention.)
“Therefore, dearly beloved, I shall in my place in Parliament, or if
called to attend the council-board of my Sovereign, approve of a mild
check upon railroad speculation. We have enough on hand at present
for any prudent men to perform. Next year, my dear brother-capitalists,
we shall be having our calls to pay, which I am sure you will all
discharge with cheerful punctuality. (Hear, hear ! cries of Oh, yes / Of
course 1 Wish you may get it.) I am not a croaker by nature, and only
prophesy on rare occasions; but, upon my honour and conscience, it
seems to me to be touch-and-go with the prosperity of this great country
at this very moment when I am drinking your healths. (Cheers) You
have the start of all Europe as you have always had ; and the railroad
system successfully carried out, will make such vast changes, and work
such prodigious benefits, as I believe a man has scarcely an idea of now.
(Sneers.) But (without rebuking the sneer of my worthy friend, MR.
Coldshoulder, for I must speak a volume to set him right, and then he
wouldn't understand me) it depends on you now, whether the pre-eminence
which you have earned shall remain with you, or the ruin which all the
world is longing to see accomplished, shall fall upon you. (Thrilling
sensation.)
“If I were an enemy of my country—If I were an aristocrat bent
upon the maintenance of my Order, and dimly seeing that, with the
triumph of the Railroad system my coronets, and my lordships, and my
stars and garters, must infallibly disappear into Hades—I would, far from
discouraging the present Railroad mania, exaggerate it in every way. . I
would rejoice to see the capital of the country engaging itself beyond its
means—plunging into speculations which must end hopelessly—and then
the ruined land would come under my sway again, and the old system be
paramount once more. But let us hope better things of the national
prudence, and that our own greediness and lust of gain is not to be the
cause of our ruin. If we are but prudent, Gentlemen, there is no end to
the anniversaries which we may be called upon to celebrate here; to the
dividends which we may announce to happy shareholders in our line; to
the branch lines which may spring from it; and to the premiums which
we, as directors, may pocket. (Immense cheering.) I will conclude,
Gentlemen, by giving you—The Railroad-market, and may we know when
we have got enough.”
After this and other eloquent speeches, Mr. Punch went home; but,
in spite of his own injunctions to caution, and gloomy predictions
regarding over-speculation, the infatuated gentleman wrote two-
and-twenty fresh applications for shares before he went to bed that
night.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FOR PARLIAMENT.
(A CARTooN.)
The decorations of the New Houses of Parliament will be incomplete,
unless they include a representation of Justice, who is supposed to preside
over parliamentary proceedings. That the jib of Justice, to use a nautical
term, should have a mediaeval cut, is highly necessary, for two con-
siderations. In the first place, Justice, cheek by jowl as she will be with
Chivalry, and other Gothic company, will otherwise resemble a denizen of
the waters out of its element. In the second, the Justice of Parliament,
for an obvious reason, should be delineated in a style approaching cari-
cature or burlesque, which is precisely that of the Art of the middle ages.
For these good reasons, it is essential that Justice should grasp her
scales and sword by a mode of prehension practicable by no mortal; and
that those properties should be cumbersome and awkward-looking in the
extreme. There is a profundity in representing her as a supernatural
being, taking hold of things in an impossible manner. On the same deep
principle she should be drawn standing in an attitude which the human
mechanism does not admit of. There is another good reason, which we
g. not enlarge upon, why Justice should appear twisted in the British
enate.
The tardigrade character of Justice ought further to be made visible
in her feet, which should be quaintly clumsy, and contorted to a degree
involving lameness. The anatomical difficulties which oppose these
requisites are to be veiled with a profusion of drapery, which, as our
sagacious ancestors well knew, will cover outrageous drawing. The face
of Justice should be that of a monumental brass, both on account of the
aesthetical character of the material, and the corpse-like attributes proper
to Gothic sanctity. The cause of right and nature versus humbug, which
Justice is ever trying, ought to be manifested by scrolls stuck into her
scales, inscribed of course with old English characters. Altogether, the
person of Justice should be deformed, and her look old-maidish ; so that
she may be devoid of the Paganism of symmetry and beauty.
A T U R N PIE E S T R A T E G Y.
It is well known that a MR. Levi is the giant contractor for nearly
all the turnpikes in and about London. Some men have strange pets.
Levi's passion is evidently pikes. Doubtless, it is to him a sweet con-
solation to know that all men seated on or behind horses are stopped on
so many highways, and made to deliver certain sums from threepence to
a silver shilling. Let him wake in his bed at any hour of the night, and
it may be to him a pleasant thought to feel that money is even then
dropping into his fifty pockets. Well, the parishioners of Chelsea have of
late taken umbrage at LEv1. They have collectively risen like REBEccA,
and (by means of an act of Parliament) have abolished the gate at the
Queen's Elm. It was to us a touching sight—for we chanced to behold
the spectacle — to see Levi, like another SAMson, carrying away
the Queen's Elm Gate upon his shoulders, that he might pitch
it somewhere out of the parish. Now, all Acts of Parliament are
elastic ; but none can be made to stretch so much as an Act for a Turn-
pike. There is no knowing how far it may be drawn out. MR. Levi
doubtless knew this beautiful truth ; and therefore he pitched his gate
some few yards above the gate of a certain Arcadian market-gardener of
Fulham, named BoPART, with the benevolent intention of receiving certain
coppers from the aforesaid BoPART in his progress to London with his
parsley and sweet marjoram. Guileless, unsuspecting LEvil in the inno-
cence of his soul, he had not perceived that BoPART had another gate a
few paces above the turnpike; which gate, with the peculiar perverseness
of human nature, Bopart has ever since driven through, to the shameful
disuse of the old accustomed gate below. The Jew has been trumped by
the Gentile ! and it is sometimes a pathetic sight to behold Levi with
tears in his eyes, watching the progress of BoPART's market-waggon on its
way to Covent-Garden; but whether the tears are drawn from him by
Bopant's onions or the loss of BoPART's pence, we leave it to the reader
skilled in human emotion to determine.

- verybody is asking, “Should CRomwell
have a Statue 7" and Echo is in all direc-
tions bawling out, “Yes, of course.” It is
true that CRoxwell cannot be traced back
to LADY REDBURGA, or proved to be a lineal
descendant of ETHELsANThA, the wife of
ALFRED ; but he certainly played his part
of sovereign as well as if he had been “na-
tive and to the manner born” for it. We
should like to know whether he has not as
good a right to a statue as Richard The
THIRD, who played Old Harry with the
* Tower bedding, and made sandwiches of
* the infant princes between a couple of
feather beds. Nothing can palliate this
romance of the palliasse, and there is no
excuse for a downy uncle, who smothered
the heirs to the throne in downy goose-
quill. He made the mattress and pillows of the young princes the
means of bolstering up his own title to the throne; and his subse-
quent conduct was very disgraceful, for we defy any one to see the
play of Richard the Third without coming to the conclusion that Dick
was a deceitful scoundrel. In fact, the false front he assumed has caused
that article to bear the name of Dickey up to the present period.
Then, again, look at John J. We should like to know what on earth he
deserves a statue for. He was a fellow, according to SHAkspeaRE, always
putting out young princes' eyes with enormous pincers. His intimacy
with Hubert was enough to condemn him in the opinion of any well-
regulated-minded individual.
HENRY THE Eighth, too, ought to have stood at the bar of the Old
Bailey for Sexigamy; but we think we have said enough to show that
there are a few kings in our HUME AND SMollett, who ought to be
deprived of statues, if merit gives any claim to the distinction of being
“ done in stone’ for the New Houses of Parliament. CRoxiwell was,
until his elevation, a very respectable brewer, and at least on a level
with BARcLAY, PERRINs, or MEux; and though he was not an entire
sovereign, he is by no means to be thought small beer of by the true
constitutional Englishman.

PROSPECTUS OF AN INDIAN RAILWAY,
~ Ewly started to connect the Pelo-
ponnesus of Patomaree with the
Squashamaw Districts, and the
mountains of the Bengalee on the
East, with a branch to the Boptic
Coast, and an extension to the
Fungazonian shore of the Rho-
paravian Ocean.
This important line will open
the trade of Tangaroo to all
the Merchants of the Musnic
Continent, and give a facility of
ºf M transit to the rich valleys of the
Sºl Rhippidippi, one of the most
fertile districts in the Unknown
World. The line will cross the
Rhambajee river on the north,
giving an immediate communi-
cation with the gold mines of
Swambolia Minor, on the right; while on the left, is the well-known diamond
district of Nassuck, which it is expected will become the property of the
Company. The following powerful list of local directors is given, not
so much to encourage applications for shares—which already, before the
existence of the Company is known, are so numerous, that a preference
can only be given to the most respectable—but the list is printed as a
guarantee to the public, who are waiting eagerly to snap up the scrip,
that it is well worth the premium at which they will rush to purchase it.

Applications for shares which cannot be attended to, may be made

T H E RAIL WAY CIR CU. S.
We desire to point out an opening which now presents itself to any
enterprising capitalist willing to invest a few thousands in a safe specu-
lation. Railway extension—if we may be allowed the metaphor—is very
fast snuffing-out the horse, the high-pressure engine is distancing the high-
mettled racer, and equestrian affairs in general are rapidly declining in
point of interest. Evil days are coming on top-boots, knee-cords, four-in-
hands, jockeys, and all the race of jarvey. It is manifest that Newmarket-
coats are going out of fashion, that the groom and the ostler are losing
their importance, and that respect for the stable and its accessories is
decreasing amongst the million. Accordingly, we predict that equestrian
performances will very soon be at a discount, and that the Astleyan will
share the fate of the legitimate drama.
What, under these circumstances, can be a more promising scheme
than the institution of a Railway Circus Let a company, or an indi-
vidual, only raise the wind, or get up the steam to the requisite degree,
and the affair is done. All that will be necessary will be a suitable
theatre, with an arena surrounded by circular rails. On these rails will run
the engine, round and round, in lieu of a horse; and upon the engine will
ride the engineer, appropriately attired, controlling his vehicle, and at the
same time exhibiting his performances. He will poise himself on one leg,
wave flags, go through the sword exercise, jump through hoops, and
execute all the usual feats of the riding-school, and as many more as he
can invent. He will be accompanied, of course, by a stoker; and the
pair will thus be enabled to do a pas de deur on engine-back, which will
be something entirely new to the British public. For the greater grace
of this exhibition, the stoker should be one of the fair sex; and we are
sure that a steam danseuse would prove extraordinarily attractive; or the
part itself of the engineer might be taken by a lady performer, in a short
dress, pink stockings, satin, and spangles.
The circus, of course, should be surrounded by several lines of rail, to
afford facilities for riding upon two, three, four, five, or six engines at
once, in a manner analogous to that of the late MR. Ducrow. Indeed,
the steam-rider might call himself the Railway Duckow. A clown in the
ring, of course, would be wanted; and such a gentleman as MR. BARRY
might still easily act in that capacity. His present jokes would be sus-
ceptible of many additions à propos of boilers and other appurtenances of
steam, which would be highly diverting to the spectators.
The greatest difficulty, as it strikes us, that will beset the plan in its
accomplishment, will be to find a riding-master. MR. Widdicombe,
powerful as he is, will hardly be strong enough to control the engines, and
to counteract their centrifugal tendency. This purpose, however, will
probably be answered by a post placed in the middle of the circus, and
provided with a sort of swivel, connected with the carriages by strong
chains or cables. The post might be made large enough to serve for a
pedestal, and then Widdicom BE might stand on the top of it, and thus,
more conspicuously than ever, display those graces which have rendered
him the admiration of centuries. As the consequence of this arrangement,
with regard to the clown, would be, that if he remained in the ring whilst
it was in action, the chains or cables would necessarily cut him in two, a
space might be left between the outermost rail and the barrier of the
circus, round which he might run, uttering witticisms, making grimaces,
and insulting WIDDIcombe and the performers, just as effectually as he
does at present.
In putting forth the above project, which we have not the least doubt
will be instantly caught up, we feel that we have done good service to the
drama, a fine branch of which, but for our suggestion, would shortly be
lopped off to a certainty. The only reward we expect for our thought and
trouble, in addition to an approving conscience, will be nightly orders for
two for the Railway Circus.
A NEW CURE FOR PAUPERISM.
A TESTIMONIAL, appended to a puff of some quack Pills, which lately
appeared in the Morning Herald, contains the following extraordinary
statement, signed “No DocroR :”—
“I must now say that I feel exceedingly happy in being able to testify to the efficacy
of-3 it has done that in Winchcomb which the diplomaed doctors, under the
organic theory, could not do; it has fetched a man out of the Union Workhouse, and
sent him to provide for himself with his own hands. The disease under which he was
suffering was the Evil.”
The Quacks, we always understood, professed the medicine alluded
to, to be a remedy for poverty of the blood; but now they would seem
to make it out a cure for pauperism itself—for “the Evil” — the
Grand Evil;-not the King's Evil only, but the Subject's Evil. We
believed—as implicitly as we believe in the Koran—that it would cure all
diseases; but we did not believe that it would cure pecuniary as well as
pulmonary consumption. We were satisfied—as we are of the truth of
GULLlveR's travels—that it would restore a lost leg ; but we hardly
thought it would replenish an empty pocket. We were convinced—as we
are that white is black—that it would snatch a man out of the jaws of
Death; but we never imagined it would bring him out of the Workhouse.
Let the benevolent subscribe instantly, and buy a cart-load of the pills for
distribution amongst all the Unions, beginning with Andover.

The STAG.
The Stag is a railway ruminant, and belongs to a common herd that
may be seen loitering about the neighbourhood of the Stock Exchange.
The Railway Stag has his head full of branches, but he sheds a new
branch directly there is any premium. He is exceedingly fleet of foot,
and when he is once off there is no catching him. Some Railway Stags
are, however, distinguished by a sort of waddle, like that of the lame duck
of the Stock Exchange. There are strange stories told of the various
forms assumed by the Railway Stag ; for the animal is exceedingly cun-
ning, and will resort to any artifice to keep out of danger. The Railway
Stag often causes great annoyance to the bulls and bears in the neighbour-
hood of the Stock Exchange.
THE PRIVILEGE OF SMOKE.
A conBEspondent of the Morning Chronicle, signing himself “E. O.,”
states, that, lately, in St. James's Park, he observed one of the Park-
keepers order a man to remove a pipe from his mouth, whereas he was
himself allowed to continue in the enjoyment of a cigar, which he was
smoking. On inquiry as to the reason of this anomaly, he was told that
pipes were forbidden by the Commissioners. Some may be puzzled to
account for this distinction of smokers, but we are not ; as the following
formula will testify :-

OH ! take away my wig and gown,
Their sight is mock’ry now to me:
I pace my chambers up and down
Reiterating “Where is he 3’’
Alas! wild Echo, with a moan,
Murmurs above my fever'd head:
In the wide world I am alone ;
Ha! haſ my only client's—dead.
In vain the robing room I seek;
The very waiters scarcely bow.5
Their looks contemptuously speak,
“He’s lost his only client now.”
E’en the mild usher, who, of yore,
Would hasten when his name I said,
To hand in motions, comes no more,
He knows my only client's dead.
Ne'er shall I, rising up in Court,
Open the pleadings of a suit :
Ne'er shall the Judges cut me short,
While moving them for a compute.
No more with a consenting brief
Shall I politely bow my head;
Where shall I run to hide my grief?
Alas! my only client’s dead.
Imagination's magic power
Brings back, as clear as clear can be,
The spot, the day, the very hour,
When first I sign'd my maiden plea.

In vain, I try to sing—I'm hoarse :
In vain I try to play the flute,
A phantom seems to flit across,
It is the ghost of a compute.
I try to read—but all in vain;

Be still, my heart; throb less, my brain;
Ho I ho! my only client's dead.

WONDERFUL HORTICULTURAL PHENOMENON.
A New kind of fruit has lately been introduced into London. It is
nown amongst those who have particularly studied its cultivation, as
“The apple with the silver pips.” One was shown to us, which, upon
being cut open, really contained a shilling ; but the generality of them, we
believe, do not grow anything larger than a fotirpenny-piece. The one
we saw had been picked up at Charing-cross. It had been thrown by one
of the omnibus-drivers to a policeman, who had been loudly directing him
to “move on,” but the policeman failing to catch it, the apple had fallen
into the hands of a rival cad, who enjoyed the phenomenon of the “silver
pip” no less than the fruit, for, after eating the latter with great relish, he
spent the shilling in something to drink, to ascertain if the pip was real.
These wonderful apples, which we take the scientific liberty of calling
“Poma Cadiensis,” are in great demand amongst the numerous time-
keepers of London, but the policemen are no less eager in running after
them. They are of very quick growth. An omnibus that halts five minutes
at one station will produce a ripstone of the value of sixpence, but as much
as a quarter of an hour is necessary to bring forth the largest specimens.
These contain from two to three pips, running from sixpence to a shilling
a piece. We have forwarded the specimen, which has been sent to us, to
the Horticultural Society. If it realises all that is said of it, it certainly
would be invaluable at elections.
I R IS EI IM A G E R Y.
At a recent Repeal meeting MR. O'Connell was described by one of
the speakers as “an oak of the forest, every hair of whose head was
sanctified.” We never saw an oak with a fine head of hair; though it
is, no doubt, possible; for people are talking a good deal just now about the
curl in the potato; and if potatoes can be possessed of curls, we do not see
why trees should not have hair also. We can scarcely see how O'Connºll.
is an oak of the forest, though, in our opinion, he seems to be most at
home when in the Groves of Blarney.
AMATEUR CRIMINALS,
Poor Eliza GRIMwood appears to be a great favourite with the army.
We know not how many soldiers have declared themselves guilty of her
murder, that they might escape the glory that ever casts a halo about the
private soldier's name. The public attention is aroused by the newspaper
paragraph — police officers are suddenly very busy—the magistrate,
meaning serious business, takes his seat, and the self-accused is brought
in. Whereupon, he thrusts his tongue in his cheek, declares his confes-
sion to be all a flam, and in the end walks away—mockingly applying
his thumb to the end of his nose at poor hoaxed Justice. Now, we think
there should be some remedy for this. If fellows like GeoRGE HILL, the
last humourist of the 67th Foot, choose to have their dismal joke with
society, we certainly think that society should be allowed to make its
repartee. Therefore, when a HILL “murders in jest,” why not punish
him in jest? When he assures the magistrate that the whole story is a
fable, might he not be retorted upon in the same funny spirit Thus,
when sentenced to a month or two at the treadmill, if the humourist
complained of the inconvenience, he might be met with a reply that it
was not the treadmill, but merely a practical joke—nothing more than a
bit of drollery, that if he had any sense at all of the humorous, he must
do all he could to keep going. And if—as it sometimes happens with the
most inveterate jokers—he should continue very obtuse to the fun, we do
not see why his notion of the comic should not be quickened by severer
punishment; but of course—only in joke.

Ir will be seen that Spanish Railways are beginning to attract atten-
tion in the British market. When our readers remember the quantity of
Spanish liquorice consumed in this cold and cough-generating climate of
ours, they will see that the mercantile traffic must be tremendous on any
Spanish line that has English shareholders. The Madrid and Valencia
Railway that has been projected, will give an immense impetus to the
trade in Valencia waistcoats, and if the Company will send us a large
allotment of shares, we will undertake to write it up till the scrip is at
twenty premium.
We perceive from the advertising columns of our contemporaries that
a Grand Trunk Railway has been started. We should suggest a Grand
Carpet, Rug, and Bonnet-Box Junction as a very desirable branch, and a
London Direct Portmanteau one would, no doubt, be amazingly popular.

- THE WAR OF THE STREETS.
A sort of civil war has lately been raging with tremendous violence
between the paviers and the populace. The great scene of contention
has been Fleet Street, which ought in future to be called Thermopylae,
for never was that famous pass more stoutly defended, than the
thoroughfare between Temple Bar and Ludgate Hill, within the last
fortnight.
The paviers took possession of the ground unexpectedly in the course
of a single night, and by the next day they had thrown up strong fortifi-
cations of bricks, behind which they stubbornly resisted the approach
of the enemy. The populace were soon on the spot with their heavy
luggage omnibuses, with which an attempt was made to force a passage;
but the paviers had taken their measures so effectually, that Fleet
Street was utterly impassable. Baffled in this attempt, the populace turned
their horses' heads up Fetter Lane; and some made an effort to penetrate
into the City by cutting across the heights of Holborn; but here, again,
they met with the most obstinate resistance from the pavier party who
had contrived to gain possession of all the principal metropolitan passes
at the same moment. Some of the unfortunate victims hoping to make
good their retreat, fell back towards the west, intending to escape along
Piccadilly: but even here the paviers were found to have made them-
selves masters of the passage, which they barred against every one. In
this dilemma the populace, finding the City in the hands of the paviers,
had no other course than to surrender at discretion. -
We have not heard what has been the result of the conflict, but from
the number of horses we saw down, and vehicles overturned, it is certain
! that an enormous loss has been sustained by the populace.
IMPORTANCE OF THE EXTERIOR.
It having been settled by Magisterial Decision that a
FASHIONABLY, CUT COAT
will subject drunk and disorderly Sparks, who pull off Knockers, to a
mere Fine, whereas the wearer of an
INFERIOR ARTICLE
would, for a like offence, be consigned to the Tread-Mill,
Messrs. Mordecai and Sons,
of the Minories, confidently recommend their
NEW POLICE WRAPPER
to the Patronage of Larking Gents. A large Stock may be inspected at
the Establishment. Warranted to screen the Perpetrator for the most
Flagrant Outrage.
N.B. For Cash only.
--
ST. PAUL’S EXHIBITION.
It may not be generally known that among the Metropolitan Exhibitions
is included the interior of St. Paul's between the services, which, under
the management of the Dean and Chapter, is open to the public at two-
pence a head. This speculation, perhaps, would answer better were
greater publicity given to it." The Dean and Chapter might find it
worth their while to advertise their Church in the newspapers. A few
shillings spent in this way, painful as might be the sacrifice, would
be money well laid out. At all events, their Reverences might distribute
about town a few placards and posters, and bills of their Exhibition, like
those put forth by the Colosseum people. Everybody is not aware that
St. Paul's, as well as the building by the Regent's Park, has its Glyp-
totheca, with Lord Nelson in it, and DR. Johnson, and Howard the
Philanthropist, and Lord Howe, all larger than life. But were we the
showmen—we beg pardon—the Dean and Chapter—of St. Paul's Cathe-
dral, we would gofurther. Having once brought ourselves—for there would
be the only difficulty—to make a show of our Church at all, we would
regularly go the whole Wombwell. We would erect a scaffold in front
of the sacred edifice, with poles upon it, and on these poles large sheets of
canvas displaying paintings of the lions to be seen within. On the scaf-
fold should be seated a dozen beefeaters or so, with drums, trumpets,
ophicleides, trombones, and Pandean pipes, who, by their music, should
attract the attention of passengers. To these, perhaps, we would add a
clown, to fling summersets, and stand upon his head, and to bawl out
between the tunes —“Here we are I" “Hoy, Hoy, Hoy 1” “Walk up,
Ladies and Gentlemen : " " Just a-going to commence 1” “Only Two
Pence 1" and so forth. But this would be scandalous—unclerical—
—profane ! Wery, well. Then we would throw open our doors gratis.
We would be either clergymen or showmen, but whichever we called our-
selves, we would act as such.
-
THE CALAMITIES OF A DOOR-PLATE.
Attorneys, surgeons, artists, and other professional men, generally
have their names on their doors. A name on a door is a fine thing when
accompanied by plenty of dirt on the scraper; in other words, when
it causes an influx of business. It occasions, however, certain results
which are inevitable. In the first place, a name on the door, constantly
for a twelvemonth after its institution, and from time to time ever af-
terwards, is sure to procure for its owner visits from sham missionaries,
begging-letter impostors, and all varieties of the “doo.” Secondly, especially
during this period of railway speculation, it entails upon him, daily, the
plague of loads of prospectuses of all kinds, foreign lottery schemes, and
other catchpenny circulars, by thousands. These, offering, for the most part,
opportunities for the “eligible investment” of capital, are often addressed
to those who have no capital to invest, eligibly or otherwise. What cruel
irony to the professional pauper . In this respect, Assurance Companies are
a great nuisance, and very provoking is their assurance. The bored one, it
is true, may laugh in his sleeve at the attempt on his visionary Three Per
Cents., or, if a smoker, he may light his cigars with its vehicle :-so much
for his consolation . But there is one atrocious thing which these circular-
writers do, and which, at least, they ought to discontinue. They fre-
quently have their letters directed in a female hand—and that to the
young, and enamoured, bachelor. This involves a hoax which we have no
hesitation in terming heartless. Thus to raise emotions only to crush
them, is a mockery worthy of no place above Pandemonium — except
'Change Alley. Send your prospectuses, ye speculators, to capitalists and
married men

MRS. CAUDLE’S CURTAIN LECTURES.
LECTURE XXXIV.
MRS. CAUDLE, SUSPECTING THAT MR, CAUDLE HAS MADE HIS WILL,
IS “ ONLY ANXIOUS AS A WIFE” TO KNOW ITS PROVISIONS.
HERE, I always said you’d a strong mind when
you liked, CAUDLE ; and what you’ve just been
doing proves it. Some people won't make a
will, because they think they must die directly
afterwards. Now, you’re above that, love,
arn’t you? Nonsense; you know very well
what I mean. I know your will’s made, for
ScRATcHERLY told me so. What? You don't
beliere it 2 Well, I’m sure That’s a pretty
thing for a man to say to his wife. I know
he’s too much a man of business to talk; but
I suppose there’s a way of telling things
without speaking them. And when I put the
question to him, lawyer as he is, he hadn't the
face to deny it.
“To be sure, it can be of no consequence to
me whether your will is made or not. I shall
not be alive, MR. CAUDLE, to want anything:
I shall be provided for a long time before your
will's of any use. No, Ma. CAUDLE ; I shan’t survive you : and—
though a woman's wrong to let her affection for a man be known,
for then she’s always taken advantage of though I know it’s foolish
and weak to say so, still I don’t want to survive you. How should
I? No, no ; don't say that: I’m not good for a hundred—I shan’t
see you out, and another husband too ! What a gross idea, CAUDLE |
To imagine I'd ever think of marrying again. No-never ! What?
That's chat tre all say? Not at all; quite the reverse. To me the
very idea of such a thing is horrible, and always was. Yes, I know
very well, that some do marry again,_but what they’re made of,
I’m sure I can't tell ! Ugh !
“There are men, I know, who leave their property in such a way
that their widows, to hold it, must keep widows. Now, if there is
anything in the world that is mean and small, it is that... Don't you
think so too, CAUDLE * Why don’t you speak, love? That’s so like
you ! I never want a little quiet rational talk, but you want to go to
sleep. But you never were like any other man I What? How do I
know? There now, that's so like your aggravating way. I never
open my lips upon a subject, but you try to put me off! I’ve no
doubt when Miss PRETTYMAN speaks, you can answer her properly
enough. There you are, again Upon my life, it is odd; but I
never can in the most innocent way mention that person's name
that—Why can't I leare her alone? I’m sure—with all my heart 1
Who wants to talk about her? I don't : only you always will say
something that's certain to bring up her name.
“What was I saying, CAUDLE * Oh, about the way some men
bind their widows. To my mind, there is nothing so little. When
a man forbids his wife to marry again without losing what he leaves
—it’s what I call selfishness after death. Mean to a degree It’s
like taking his wife into the grave with him. Eh! You never want
to do that 2 No, I’m sure of that, love : you’re not the man to tie a
woman up in that mean manner. A man who’d do that, would have
his widow burnt with him, if he could—just as those monsters, that
call themselves men, do in the Indies.
“However, it’s no matter to me how you’ve made your will ; but
it may be to your second wife. What? I shall nerer gire you a chance 3
Hal you don't know my constitution after all, CAUDLE. I’m not at
all the woman I was. I say nothing about 'em, but very often you
don’t know my feelings. And as we’re on the subject, dearest, I
have only one favour to ask. When you marry again—now it's no
use your saying that. After the comforts you’ve known of marriage
—what are you sighing at, dear?—after the comforts, you must
marry again—now don't forswear yourself in that violent way, taking
an oath that you know you must break—you couldn't help it, I’m
sure of it; and I know you better than you know yourself. Well,
all I ask is, love, because it’s only for your sake, and it would make
no difference to me then—how should it !—but all I ask is, don't
marry Miss PRET There ! there ! I’ve done; I won't say
another word about it: but all I ask is, don't. After the way
you’ve been thought of, and after the comforts you’ve been used to,
CAUDLE, she wouldn't be the wife for you. Of course, I could then
have no interest in the matter—you might marry the QUEEN of
ENGLAND, for what it would be to me then—I’m only anxious about
you. Mind, CAUDLE, I’m not saying anything against her; not at
all ; but there’s a flightiness in her manner—I dare say, poor thing,
she means no harm, and it may be, as the saying is, only her manner
after all—still, there is a flightiness about her that, after what
you’ve been used to, would make you very wretched. No, for if I
may boast of anything, CAUDLE, it has been my propriety of
manner all my life. I know that wives who're very particular, arn’t
thought as well of as those who're not—still, it is very little to
be virtuous, if people don't seem so. And virtue, CAUDLE—no, I'm
not going to preach about virtue, for I never do. No ; and I don’t
go about with my virtue, like a child with a drum, making all sorts
of noises with it. But I know your principles. I shall never forget
what I once heard you say to PRETTYMAN : and it's no excuse that
you'd taken so much wine you didn't know what you were saying at
the time; for wine brings out men's wickedness, just as fire brings
out spots of grease. What did you say? Why you said this:—
‘Virtue's a beautiful thing in women, when they don’t make so
much noise about it; but there’s some women, who think virtue
was given 'em, as claws were given to cats’—yes, cats was the word
— to do nothing but scratch with.” That’s what you said. You
don't recollect a syllable of it? No, that’s it; when you're in that
dreadful state, you recollect nothing : but it’s a good thing I do.
“But we won't talk of that, love—that’s all over: I dare say you
meant nothing. But I’m glad you agree with me, that the man
who'd tie up his widow, not to marry again, is a mean man. It
makes me happy that you’ve that confidence in me to say that.
You never said it 9 That’s nothing to do with it—you’ve just as good
as said it. No when a man leaves all his property to his wife,
without binding her hands from marrying again, he shows what a
dependence he has upon her love. He proves to all the world what
a wife she’s been to him ; and how, after his death, he knows she’ll
grieve for him. And then, of course, a second marriage never enters
her head. But when she only keeps his money so long as she keeps
a widow, why she's aggravated to take another husband. I’m sure
of it, many a poor woman has been driven into wedlock again, only
because she was spited into it by her husband's will. It’s only
natural to suppose it. If I thought, CAUDLE, you could do such a
thing, though it would break my heart to do it, yet, though you
were dead and gone, I’d show you I’d a spirit, and marry again
directly. Not but what it’s ridiculous my talking in such a way, as
I shall go long before you ; still, mark my words, and don't provoke
me with any will of that sort, or I’d do it—as I’m a living woman
in this bed, I’d do it.”
“I did not contradict her,” says CAUDLE, “but suffered her to
sleep in such assurance.”
THE THOROUGHFARE-PHOBIA.
A New disease has, within the last few months, become very prevalent
in the Metropolis; and as no name has yet been given to it, we honour it
with the appellation of the Thoroughfare-phobia. It consists of a very
dangerous stoppage, preventing the free circulation of the blood of com-
merce through the veins and arteries of the Metropolis. . Fleet Street has
been seized in this shocking way several times during the present year ;
and Piccadilly, which we thought had just got over a very long attack,
has suffered a serious relapse within the last week or two.
We really begin to tremble for the very existence of the city, when we
see these awful symptoms of a general breaking up beginning to show
themselves in all quarters of the Metropolis. If the suburban roads,
which are called the lungs of London, should be taken in the same way,
suffocation would be the inevitable consequence.
Duration of vegetable Life.
WE understand that in consequence of the severe illness which has
afflicted the potatoes, and caused so much mortality among the champions
of the dinner-table, a new company is about to be formed, for the purpose
of insuring the lives of vegetables. Any person sowing a crop of peas,
and paying a premium of a halfpenny a peck, may insure a certain sum
in the event of their being nipped in the bud, cut off in the blossom of
youth, or dying after they have passed their infancy and have been put
into jackets. It is calculated that a vegetable may reach a good old age,
if there is not too much wet ; but the premium will be large enough to
guard against the consequences of excessive drinking, which is as bad for
a vegetable as for a human being.

PUNCH, -
BRIGHTON.
By “PUNch’s ” commissionER.
As there are some consumptive travellers, who, by dodging about to
Italy, to Malta, to Madeira, manage to cheat the winter, and for whose
lungs a perpetual warmth is necessary; so there are people to whom, in
like manner, London is a necessity of existence, and who follow it all the
year round. Such individuals, when London goes out of town, follow it to
| Brighton, which is, at this season, London plus prawns for breakfast and
the sea-air. Blessings on the sea-air, which gives you an appetite to eat them!
You may get a decent bed-room and sitting-room here for a guinea a
day. Our friends the Boribols have three rooms, and a bedstead disguised
like a chest of drawers in the drawing-room, for which they pay something
less than a hundred pounds a month. I could not understand last night
why the old gentleman, who usually goes to bed early, kept yawning and
fidgetting in the drawing-room after tea; until, with some hesitation, he
made the confession that the apartment in question was his bed-room,
and revealed the Inystery of the artful chest of drawers. Botibol's house
in Bedford Square is as spacious as an Italian palace: the second-floor
front, in which the worthy man sleeps, would accommodate a regiment,
and here they squeeze him into a chiffonnière t How Mrs. B. and the four
delightful girls can be stowed away in the back room, I tremble to think:
what bachelor has a right to ask? But the air of the sea makes up for
the closeness of the lodgings. I have just seen them on the Cliff-mother
and daughters were all blooming like crimson double dahlias I
You meet everybody on that Cliff. For a small charge you may
hire, the very fly here represented; with the very horse, and the very
postilion, in a pink striped chintz jacket—which may have been the
cover of an arm-chair once—and straight whitey-brown hair, and little
wash-leather inexpressibles, the cheapest little caricature of a post-boy
eyes have ever lighted on. I seldom used to select his carriage, for the
horse and vehicle looked feeble, and unequal to bearing a person of
weight; but, last Sunday I saw an Israelitish family of distinction en-
sconced in the poor little carriage—the ladies with the most flaming
polkas, and flounces all the way up ; the gent. in velvet waistcoat, with
pins in his breast big enough once to have surmounted the door of his
native pawnbroker's shop, and a complement of hook-nosed children, mag-
nificent in attire. Their number and magnificence did not break the
carriage down ; the little postilion bumped up and down as usual, as the
old horse went his usual pace. How they spread out, and basked, and
shone, and were happy in the sun there—those honest people The
Mosaic Arabs abound here; and they rejoice and are idle with a grave
and solemn pleasure, as becomes their Eastern origin.
If you don't mind the expense, hire a ground-floor window on the Cliff,
and examine the stream of human nature which passes by. That stream
is a league in length; it pours from Brunswick Terrace to Kemp Town,
and then tumbles back again; and so rolls, and as it rolls perpetually,
keeps rolling on from three o'clock till dinner-time.
Ha! what'a crowd of well-known London faces you behold here—only
the sallow countenances look pink now, and devoid of care. I have seen
this very day, at least—
Forty-nine Railroad directors, who would
have been at Baden-Baden but for the lines
in progress; and who, though breathing the
fresh air, are within an hour and a half of
the City.
Thirteen barristers, of more or less repute,
including the Solicitor-GENERAL himself,
whose open and jovial countenance beamed
with benevolence upon the cheerful scene.
A Hebrew dentist driving a curricle.
At least twelve well-known actors or actresses.
It went to my heart to see the most fashion-
able of them, driving about in a little four-
wheeled pony-chaise, the like of which might
be hired for five shillings.
Then you have tight-laced dragoons, trotting
up and down with solemn, handsome, stupid faces,
and huge yellow mustachios. Myriads of flies,
laden with happy cockneys; pathetic invalid
chairs trail along, looking too much like coffins
already, in which poor people are brought out
to catch a glimpse of the sun. Grand equip-
ages are scarce; I saw LADY WILHELMINA
Wiggins's lovely nose and auburn ringlets peeping out of a cab, hired at
half-a-crown an hour, between her ladyship and her sister, the PRINCEss
OYSTERowski.
>k -k
The old gentleman who began to take lessons when we were here three
years ago, at the Tepid Swimming Bath, with the conical top, I am given
to understand is still there, and may be seen in the water, from nine till five.

“THERE IS NO DECEPTION.”
THERE is now exhibiting, somewhere near Whitechapel, a very affable
gentleman, who enjoys the peculiarity of being a salamander-nay, we beg
pardon, a “salamander, &c.” He is, of course, not native, although to
the manner born ; but a Frenchman—a Monsieur du Pshal we
have forgotten the rest of his surname: however, we can vouch for the
genuineness of the du. This remarkable man professes that no place can
be too hot to hold him. In fact, fire is to him what salary is to advertis-
ing governesses, “not so much an object as a comfortable situation.” All
his triumphs are literally blazes. We find, upon reference to the programme,
that the Monsieur “has the power of resisting the effects of poison ; ” in
proof of which he empties a glass of prussic acid tout de suite, as one would
toss off a seidlitz-powder, and makes nothing of putting a bit of arsenic
into his pipe and smoking it.
But we can convey no adequate motion of the amazing powers of this
“salamander, &c.,” except in his own concluding words:–
“*.*. In order to convince the most sceptical that there is no deceit or trickery in the
above wonderful performances, medical gentlemen are requested to ascend the stage,
and to bring their own poison!”
This is indeed a touch of earnest altogether out of the reach of jest!
Lawyers' Isabels.
Much inconvenience has been experienced by the public, on account of
the functionaries connected with the law having gone out of town for the
long vacation, leaving no notices on their doors, and dooming the various
suitors or their attorneys to continue kicking their heels about on the top
of a staircase, without knowing what has become of the occupants of the
chambers.
Very considerable annoyance has been caused by the Taxing Masters
having rushed out of town, without putting a piece of paper on their
doors stating where they have gone to, and when they are coming back
again. We have therefore to propose a series of labels for the use of the
legal profession in general, but the Taxing Masters in particular. “Gone
to the Rhine; please to wait,” would do very well in many cases: or, “At
Baden-Baden ; return immediately,” might encourage applicants for a
little while longer to keep their patience. “Gone to the Isle of Wight—
soon be back;” “The Taxing Master in Italy—Clerk at Margate,” would
also meet the circumstances of the case in numerous instances.
A RAILWAY PAN ic,
THE Boulogne News emphatically calls upon the public to refrain from
railway speculation, on the ground that many schemes will be unfinished
for want of the necessary iron. To say the truth, we do not anticipate
a stoppage from want of iron, though we expect there will some day or
other be a frightful smash for want of tin.

PoST-orr1 CE PANIC.
THE
THERE are rumours that the people engaged in the Post-Office are daily
in danger of being suffocated, swamped, and smothered, by the enormous
quantity of letters pouring in upon them at every chink, hole, corner, and
cranny of the establishment. An unhappy clerk was found struggling with
a pile of newspapers, to which he had nearly succumbed, when one of the
sorters came up, just soon enough to rescue him from an untimely end.
An official sitting at one of the windows, very near a receiving-box, was
suddenly carried off his stool, and almost completely immersed in a terrific
flood of what proved on inquiry to be an ocean of applications for shares
in Railway Companies. Another able and respected functionary was
found buried under a heap of papers, which had come in suddenly, like a
spring-tide, and which proved to be a perfect sea of inquiries as to the
time fixed for the appearance of “Punch's Pocket Book.” To prevent a
recurrence of this fearful incident, we beg to announce the
First of Novembert
as the day when the hopes of millions will be realised, by the publication
of the work alluded to.
THE GEORGES.
As the statues of these beloved Monarchs are to be put up in the
Parliament palace—we have been favoured by a young lady (con-
nected with the Court) with copies of the inscriptions which are to
be engraven under the images of those Stars of Brunswick.
GEORGE THE FIRST-start of BRunswick.
He preferred Hanover to England,
He preferred two hideous Mistresses
To a beautiful and innocent Wife.
He hated Arts and despised Literature;
But He liked train-oil in his salads,
And gave an enlightened patronage to bad oysters.
And he had Walpole as a Minister:
Consistent in his Preference for every kind of Corruption.
GEORGE II.
In most things I did as my father had done,
I was false to my wife and I hated my son :
My spending was small and my avarice much,
My kingdom was English, my heart was High Dutch:
At Dettingen fight I was known not to blench,
Ibutchered the Scotch, and I bearded the French:
I neither had morals, nor manners, nor wit;
I wasn't much missed when I died in a fit.
Here set up my statue, and make it complete—
With Pitt on his knees at my dirty old feet.
GEORGE III.
Give me a royal niche—it is my due,"
The virtuousest King the realm eer knew.
I, through a decent reputable life,
Was constant to plain food and a plain wife.
Ireland Irisked, and lost America;
But dined on legs of mutton every day.
My brain, perhaps, might be a feeble part;
But yet I think I had an English heart.
When all the Kings were prostrate, I alone
Stood face to face against Narol EoN ;
Nor ever could the ruthless Frenchman forge
A fetter for OLD ENGLAND and OLD GEon GE :
I let loose flaming NE1.son on his fleets ;
I met his troops with WELLEsley's bayonets.
Triumphant waved my flag on land and sea:
Where was the King in Europe like to me !
Monarchs exiled found shelter on my shores;
My bounty rescued Kings and Emperors.
Dut what boots victory by land or sea 1
What boots that Kings found refuge at my knee!
I was a conqueror, but yet not proud ;
And careless, even though NApol. EoN bow’d.
The rescued Kings came kiss my garments' hem:
The rescued Kings I never heeded them.
My guns roar'd triumph, but I never heard :
All England thrilled with joy, I never stirred.
What care had I of pomp, or fame, or power,
A crazy old blind man in Windsor Tower
Georgius ULTIMuS.
He left an example for age and for youth
To avoid.
He never acted well by Man or Woman,
' And was as false to his Mistress as to his Wife.
He deserted his Friends and his Principles.
He was so Ignorant that he could scarcely Spell;
But he had some Skill in Cutting out Coats,
And an undeniable Taste for Cookery.
IIe built the Palaces of Brighton and of Buckingham,
And for these Qualities and Proofs of Genius,
An admiring Aristocracy
Christened him the “First Gentleman in Europe.”
Friends, respect the IXING whose Statue is here,
And the generous Aristocracy who admired him.
A SURPRISE FOR STAUDIGL.
ARAGRAPHs have been going the round of the papers on the
subject of an intended surprise for STAUD1GL on his arrival
at Vienna. It is to consist of a little music outside the
window of his house—which is a sort of surprise we often
get from a barrel-organ, and other surprising, but not
about it,” says the paragraph. Of course not. The Pet of
the Ballet knows nothing about the second-hand halfpenny
bouquets that come showering down from the top box over
, the proscenium at the end of a solo bit in a pas de Qu'est-ce
que vous dites, or dance of what-do-you-call it. STAUDIGL
is to be engaged in a game at chess by a friend—at least,
such, we are told, is a part of the plot that is to be played

PoET BUNN's opening of DRURY LANE THEATRE.
HIS DRAMATIC MAJESTY ALFRED-surnamed the Poet—went in state to open
the theatrical session at Drury Lane. He looked remarkably well, consider-
ing; and preparations on an extensive scale had been made for receiving him.
. Sand had been thrown in great profusion over the passages through which the
potentate had to pass, and as he alighted from his vehicle he was received with
an enthusiastic shout from the stage-door-keeper. As His Majesty passed through
the hall, the messenger whistled “See the Conquering Hero comes,” while two of
the carpenters struck up “Scenes so charming, once more I view you,” as BuNN
made his way through the crowd of flats to the centre of the stage, where he
delivered the following
speech FROM THE Music-stool.
“In calling you together for the despatch of business, I have done as I thought
proper.
“I am happy to say that I continue to receive from foreign powers the most
friendly assurances, and I have entered into treaties with the French, which will
prevent our having to rely on any of our native produce, which I have always been
accustomed to look upon as a very raw article.
“I feel called upon particularly to direct your attention to the state of the
forces, and I have made arrangements for adding to the standing army of super-
numeraries; for I am convinced that my government depends on the numerical
strength which I am able to display. -
“I regret to say that I have had a dispute with the German Queen of Song,
who having come to terms with me has refused to fulfil the treaty she has entered
into. I shall take immediate measures to compel obedience, and in the mean time
Irely on the loyalty of my own subjects to sustain those high characters into which
I thrust them as stopgaps, when I have no foreigner to put into them.
* GenTLEMEN of THE DRAMA,
“I have caused an estimate, namely, my own estimate of your abilities, to be
laid before you in my book on the stage, to which I beg leave to direct your special
attention.
“Numerous bills will be introduced in the course of the season, and there are
several which will be framed with the view of introducing foreign bars and staves
into this country. -
“I have to congratulate my people on the increased demand for capers, which
will give perpetual employment, at fifteen shillings a week, to a numerous body
of my subjects.
“I have to call your attention to the repeal of the union between my English
Nonsense and Balfe's Irish Melodies. I think the separation will be for the good
of the public, though, personally, I greatly regret it.
“With reference to taxation, I have only to observe that I shall continue to
tax the patience of the public as heavily as heretofore.
A “I have been for some time in treaty with a market-gardener, to furnish
- cº-º-c- _--~ bouquets, to be thrown on the stage; and I hope that I shall be able to ensure a

regular supply for equal distribution among all my subjects, from the
highest soprano to the lowest bass in the chorus.”
At the conclusion of this speech, which was received with much
applause, a triumphant procession was formed to escort the potentate
round the stage to the door of his dressing-room.
The procession was preceded by two of GESLEa's archers, who carried
out the idea of bowmen most admirably, as to their legs; and they were
immediately followed by a corps of figurantes, known as the “Old
Heavies.” Coryphées danced on either side, and the dramatic potentate
was supported right and left by various operatic knights, in their day
costume. He was seated on a triumphal car; his foot resting on Shaks-
peare, and his hand supporting the original lyre which he swept, when
he succeeded in kicking up the tremendous dust that he made two seasons
ago with the Bohemian Girl. He wore the wreath of Apollo, from the
farce of Midas, and the procession having moved on, the whole of the
establishment joined in the following loyal chorus, to the air of
“RULE BRITANNIA.”
Rule, Great BUNN, here,

We are not among thosee who like going on with the March of
Intellect at the old jog-trot pace, for we rather prefer running on before
to loitering by the side, and we have consequently taken a few strides in
advance with Geography, by furnishing a Map of England, as it will be
in another year or two. Our country will, of course, never be in chains,
for there would be such a general bubbling up of heart's blood, and such
a bounding of British bosoms, as would effectually prevent that ; but
though England will never be in chains, she will pretty soon be in irons,
as a glance at the numerous new Railway prospectuses will testify. It is
boasted that the spread of Railways will shorten the time and labour of
travelling ; but we shall soon be unable to go anywhere without
crossing the line,—which once used to be considered a very formidable
undertaking...We can only say that we ought to be going on very smoothly,
. that our country is being regularly ironed from one end of it

NICHOLAS AND THE NUNS.
Y some singular illusion, when the
EMPERoR Nicholas shed the
lustre of his countenance on
this country, it is well known
that he was considered the
very Apollo of potentates by
the female portion of the Eng-
lish aristocracy. Beautiful,
yes, and good and gentle
women, forgetting the atro-
cities of the man in what is
thought the glory of an em-
peror, crushed and crowded
for an introduction to the tre-
mendous creature, and if he
smiled or said a soft word or
two, the happy lady felt her
nature sublimated, raised far
beyond mere mortal happi-
mess by the condescension.
English wives and mothers
forgot the unmanly oppressor
of Polish women—the child-
stealer and the flogger. We
now take from the Journal
des Débats—certainly not the
least temperate of French
journals—as quoted in the
Times, an account of the
murder, and the worse than
murder, of forty-seven Polish
Catholic nuns who dwelt in
an ancient convent near the
town of Minsk. Their duties
were as those of the Sisters of
Charity. “They instructed
the children, provided for the
widows and aged, and assisted
the poor by the fruit of their labours.” But the EMPERoR Nicholas orders
a religion for all his subjects as he orders a uniform for his troops : he is
all for the Greek Church; though indeed, it seems diabolic mockery to
think of him in connection with any church at all. Well, the nuns would
not apostatise. Whereupon—
“During the night Cossacks surrounded the convent, seized the nuns with the most
revolting brutality, bound them with cords, and conducted them thus to Witebesk,
nearly twenty leagues from Minsk, compelling them to walk the entire distance.”
arº
Ży, A.

They were then confined in a convent of schismatical nuns, and re-
maining firm to their faith, they were forced to perform the most vile
offices, and—hear this, Ladies of England—“received regularly every
Friday fifty lashes.” They were covered with “wounds and sores.”
They were subsequently compelled to work as labourers to the masons
employed in constructing the Episcopal Palace 1 Finally, all, except
three, sunk beneath their agonies. Three escaped, and one of them, says
the Débats, “the venerable Superior, is actually at present—in Paris.”
This being the case, we put it to those high-born ladies who thronged
and fluttered about the man, under whose rule such atrocities are acted—
whether it would not be as well for them to invite over this aged nun to
England. Having worshipped the tyrant, they would make some amends
for the grievous error, by showing the sympathy of true womanhood with
one of his thousand woman victims.
DANGEROUS PASSAGE.
A small brandy-bottle was picked up in Fetter Lane last week. It
was quite empty, but contained an inscription in pencil, which ran as
follows:– “The Celerity omnibus stranded off Temple Bar. Every
passenger lost; great distress.” This created quite a sensation in the
City, as the Celerity had been due for several hours, and it was well
known she had not been hailed by anybody since the morning. It is sup-
posed she floundered for some time among the rocks that lie scattered
about the narrow straits in the dangerous channel of Fleet Street, but
was extricated at last by Policeman C 21, who is one of the old City craft.
She reached the Bank, however, in safety, about eight o'clock, her passage
from Fulham having been the longest on record.
Notice To THE TRADE.-The Lessees of Vauxhall Gardens are about
to apply to his Honour the Vice-CHANCELLOR of ENGLAND for an Injunc-
tion, to restrain MR. Richand BENTLEy, of New Burlington Street, from
pirating their work entitled “A Guide to the Royal Property,’” the said
Richand BENTley having fraudulently announced such intended piracy,
under the title of “A Book For A RAINY DAY.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
THIER S P U LLING THE LONG - Bo W.
The above is one, and perhaps the only one, of a gallery of French
Statesmen, which we do or do not intend to continue, or to leave alone,
exactly as the humour strikes us of following up or abandoning the notion
we have started with. The subject of the above Portrait—which is cer-
tainly the first and perhaps the last of our series—is the celebrated French
Statesman, THIERs, in his favourite attitude of pulling the long-bow, an
attitude he always assumes when engaged in writing. History. His
“French Revolution” was a pretty good specimen of the art, but his
“The Consulate and the Empire” places him at the very head of
literary Toxophilites.
PAUPERS AND PALACEs.
THE inmates of Hampton Court Palace have been treated with
great indignity by a “petty sessions of the justices, acting in and
for the Staines' division of the county of Middlesex.” They had
been called upon by the man for the poor-rates; and had treated that
very pushing functionary with the coolest aristocratic contempt.
They would not pay him a farthing in aid of their fellow-poor, where-
upon the aforesaid petty sessions was convened, and after certain
proceedings, usual in such cases, distress-warrants were issued against
the palace-tenants, for a rate dated so far back as May, 1839. We
look at this proceeding with astonishment and alarm. The Morning
Post has been strangely silent on the question, for surely never was
there a theme more worthy of the opposition of the mighty man who,
a week or two since, drew his paper-knife, and on Boyle's Court Guide
took a dreadful oath against, what he called, the “liberalism” of the
day. Now, if in this decision of the petty sessions, there be not
liberalism, where are we to seek that horrid doctrine !
What do we discover in this decision but a shameful, a most
democratic attempt to familiarise the minds of the select who dwell
in palaces, with all the odious qualities that long before the days of
LAzARUs were inseparable from the poor What can we perceive
in it but a brutal indifference to the sensibilities of certain folks of
aristocratic birth, making them remember that there really are such
filthy places as Unions—that there positively exist such horrid crea-
tures as pauper men, women, and children We think this a gross
offence against the privilege of high birth; and know not how the
aforesaid justices can square it with their consciences that they have
shaken the inmates of Hampton Court Palace from their dream of
serene and comfortable life—life under that Palace roof being as
smooth and cheerful as the well-mown greensward without—to look
aghast at a real tax-gatherer demanding money in the name of nasty
poverty . They might as well have shocked the Palace residents
seated at their comfortable dinner, by suddenly introducing on the
table a dish of gnawed bones fresh from Andover.
We know it may be urged that Hampton Court itself is but a sort
of Palace Union, wherein poor gentlefolks are lodged gratis. But
looking at the matter through this light, in no way improves it. We
all know the truth of the saying, “What would the poor do without
the poor?” It therefore speaks not much for the humanity of the
poor of Hampton Palace that they should thus obstinately refuse to
give the least help to their fellow poor of Hampton Union. They
can afford somewhat ; and we therefore put it to the lords and ladies,
and baronets and captains, whose names are published as poor-rate
defaulters, whether they had not better show a little fellow-feeling
for the poor who wear a union dress, and vegetate on union diet.
Their own good fortune ought to teach them sympathy. If it be their
luck to have free quarters in a palace, they should not on that
account—for such is their plea—refuse to acknowledge their yet
poorer brethren pent in a union.
SONG OF THE STAG.
THE Railway-lists proclaim the fact,
“Deposits paid this morn:”
All who have cash must sign the act,
All who have none must mourn.
Bulls, bears, around the alley throng,
It is the settling day;
Then raise the burden of our song, ,
At last the Stag must pay.
With a hey-ho, chivey !
Hark forward, tantivy
Then raise the burden of our song,
At last the Stag must pay.
Lists, prices current pass around,
Their talk is of the Rail,
The Alley echoes with the sound,
And Capel Court looks pale.
The banks fill with an anxious throng,
And money's stiff they say;
The settling’s come, too true our song,
At last the Stag must pay !
With a hey-ho, &c.
Poor Stag, for cash thy brokers bore,
And rueful is thy face;
All thy addresses serve no more-
Thy rigs are out of place.
But when the Alley runs thee down
As a tremendous doo ;
*Tis sad to think that half the town
Is just as bad as you.
Then hey ho, chivey, &c.
Qſìje Corporatium Nabp.
E are sorry to find, from an acci-
dent which nearly swamped the
LoRD MAYok and Sheriffs a few
days ago on the Thames, that the
Navy of the Corporation of London
is in a very deplorable condition.
The civic authorities were on board
their barge, and had just made
- Lambeth, with a fresh breeze
springing up from Millbank, when the Lord MAYor, seated in his
chair of state, observed that the craft lurched a little to leeward,
and he entreated the Sheriffs and Aldermen to trim the vessel, by sitting
in equal numbers on each side of the table. This seamanlike manoeuvre
was performed amid a few jokes at the Lord MAYor's well-known anxiety
to keep a balance. The mace lay on the table, among several empty
decanters and a few plates—each of which had contained six-pennyworth
of sponge-cakes—when suddenly a loud wheeze of “Ahead, there !”
emanated from the corpulent old coxswain, who was entrusted with the
rudder. The venerable old rowers still went on, for they being all deaf
with age, could not hear the coxswain, and plump they drove against one
of the piers of Westminster Bridge, throwing the MAYoa and the mace,
the Sheriffs and the sherry, the Aldermen and the sponge-cakes, all together
in one dreadful jumble on the floor of the vessel. The crew, who at their
time of life have not the nerve to sustain a shock of the kind, could render-

scheme.
no assistance, and the coxswain, who is the “Admiral Hyde Parker” of the
City, a very gallant fellow but completely worn out, took that opportunity
of resigning his situation, from which indeed he had been thrown by the
violence of the concussion.
One of the Lord MAYon's footmen, on going below to render assistance,
found the whole of the civic authorities a mere heap of ruins under the
table. WIRE was nearly crushed by a great lump of Wood that had fallen
upon him, and it was almost feared that Gibbs had gone to his last
account, which, by-the-bye, would have been his first also. Poor WIRE
was found to be literally an under-Sheriff, for everybody had tumbled
over him.
When the general consternation had subsided, it was found that the
civic party had been more frightened than hurt. But the consequences
might have been very serious. The City might have been left in a state
of anarchy, without a legitimate sovereign ; and it is possible that a sort
of Cockney “Cromwell”...would have declared himself Protector, and made
it necessary, some five hundred years hence, to inquire whether he should
have a statue?
We understand that a committee will be appointed to inquire into the
cause of the accident. Some say it was occasioned by the upstart conduct
of FATHER THAMEs, who started up under the influence of a blow from
Boreas, which no river who feels its own dignity will tamely stand.
FATHER THAMEs should, however, learn to say, “Down, swelling bosom,
down : " when the lives of the civic authorities—who are his own con-
servators—are dependent on his tranquillity.
For our own parts, we think unskilful seamanship, caused by the very
venerable state of the civic navy, occasioned the accident.
The Times suggests that a barge proper, stranded with broken oars,
should be added to the civic arms, as a memento of the accident ; and we
think a cracked skull, placed beside the broken oars, would be suil further
emblematical of what might have happened.
AN UGLY CUSTOMER.
He most effective Roland—according, we
4 believe, to Lord ByRon—for the Olivers
§ of an abusive hackney-coachman is
calling him an ugly fellow ! It is known
to have been the boast of MR. O'Con-
NELL, that he could drive a coach-and-
six through an Act of Parliament, nor
is his fluency in opprobriousness less
notorious ; and in the turpitude which
he attaches to the reproach of ugliness,
he shows a further affinity with the
brotherhood of the whip. In the course
of an invective against the Times Com-
missioner the other day at “Concilia-
tion.” Hall, he asked—
“Did they (his hearers) know what he (the Commissioner) said?'—that the Irish
women were ugly. He really did.”
Did he really? We believe not ; but no matter. Tell that, or any
thing else, to “Conciliation.” Hall. A worse charge than that of ugli-
ness, we think, was once brought against the women of England: no
matter for that either.
“ Ugly” would seem—though the fact is certainly otherwise—to be the
worst word in the O'Connell dictionary. MR. John O'Connell, the
TYDIDEs of Erin, can find no more insulting epithet to apply to the
Commissioner himself. Whether that gentleman is an ugly man or not,
we imagine that the Agitators, father and son, have found him an ugly
customer. He has done not a little to spoil their trade ; still, we wonder
that either of them should have called him ugly, since, by his revelations
of the wretchedness of the Irish peasantry, from whose hard hands is
wrung the “Repeal Rent,” he has proved them both, O'Connell Senior
and Junior, to be very pretty fellows.
A SUITABLE APPoinTMENT.
O'Connell is loud in his denunciation of the “Government Education”
Could not PEEL, to propitiate him, establish in one of the
proposed Colleges a Professorship of Billingsgate, and confer the
appointment—with an adequate salary—on the learned and vituperative
| gentleman º
THE ESCAPE OF THE ALDERMEN,
SING the adventure rare
Of those worthies of renown,
The Right Honourable Lord MAYor
Of great London's famous Town,
And the Sheriffs, and the Aldermen, at large :
On diversion they were bent,
And on junketting intent;
So they up the River went
In their barge.
Like to porpoises afloat
Roll'd their Worships in their craft,
In that truly jolly boat—
It was merry fore and aft;
The thirtieth of September was the day,
They were sitting at dessert,
With their waistcoats all ungirt,
So extremely full of turt—
—le were they.
Michael Gibbs was in his chair,
In his chair of civic state ;
And the Sheriffs near him were,—
The elect as well as late:
And the Aldermen the board were sitting round,
As they drifted up the tide,
In their cabin big and wide,
Each took care of his inside,
I’ll be bound.
In a moment, from his seat,
Was the MAYoa of London thrown,
And the Aldermen—like wheat
By the sickle newly mown:
And the Sheriffs four were stretched their length along,
And the mace joined in the fall,
With decanters, plates, and all,
Which the company did sprawl
Prone among.
Out bawled his Lordship then,
And the Corporation, too,
Loudly raised those Aldermen
Of affright the wild halloo :—
“What's the matter, what's the matter 1" was the cry;
And the answer to their shout
Was “Quick | put the barge about;
Now, you fellow there, look out,
For your eye | *
And then it did appear,
By bad steering, or bad luck,
The barge against a pier
Of Westminster Bridge had struck:
Their escape was most miraculous, indeed.
Now, your Worships, have a care
Who your navigators are,
When on board you next repair
For a feed.
A GRATUITOUS CATHEDRAL.
A gaeat panie, we understand, has been occasioned among the clergy
of St. Paul's by an announcement, which has gone the round of the
papers, to the effect that the Very Reverend the DEAN of WINCHESTER
had caused the Cathedral of that city to be opened, a certain time daily,
to the public, gratis. The clerical showmen, it appears, are afraid that
they will be expected to do likewise, and are in the greatest alarm for
their twopences. Twopence, they argue, is in itself a small sum ; but
twopence every five minutes or so comes to a round one in the course of
a day.
ºil, the DeAN of WINCHESTER should have reflected before acting as
he has done. He should have considered, that if he does not care about
money himself, there are other Deans who love it dearly, and to
whom the slightest loss is heart-rending. He has evidently no ear for
Cathedral music : that is to say, the chink of cash. But he should
have regarded other tastes than his own before endeavouring to abolish
it, and to silence those silver-toned harmonies, than which, to the feelings
of certain churchmen, the “long-drawn aisle and fretted vault” can
resound with no strains more soothing.

Whatever may have been the general result of the harvest, we cannot
congratulate PEEL on the state of his Irish crops, which have turned out
quite the reverse of what he had been sowing for. He had thrown the

soap and treasury guano, repeal caps and some still more objectionable -

number of thorns about them.
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
AREoPAGUs, Council of. Literally, the highest Court of Justice
from its being held on the top of a hill. The Areopagites were a
sort of aristocracy, and were so dreadfully particular, that they once,
according to Athenæus, “fixed a mark of disgrace on a man who
had dined at a tavern,” a decree which must have ruined all the
Cheshire Cheeses, the Dicks, Cocks, and Rainbows of the period.
The Court used to be held originally in the open air; "perhaps
because it was an open Court, or probably because, being the highest
hall of justice, there could be nothing above it.
... Anistocracy (from the Greek épio'rokpária) means, according to
its etymology, a government of the best; but this etymology is all
my eye and Betty-Mology when tested by experience. Aristocracy
also means a class of persons, and there is so much aristocracy in
England that every profession, trade, and calling, has an aristocracy
of its own, in addition to the regular nobility who call themselves,
par excellence, the aristocracy of the country. The butler lords it
over the footboy, and the regular dustman is too aristocratic to talk
to the mere mud-lark. -
ARMY. The whole military force of a nation, from the Com-
mander-in-Chief down to Old Jones, the unpromoted private who
distinguished himself at Waterloo by hiding in a hay-stack. The
early Saxons were all soldiers, and a book might have been published
called, “Every Man his own Sentinel.” Those who wish to know what
a Saxon soldier was like, may consult some needlework which is in
existence, showing the wars of HAnoLD—the needle being peculiarly
fitted for the very sharp work which HARold made of it. Before the civil
wars there was no permanent army in England; but the CHARLEses
and JAMEs THE SEcond were so fond of playing at soldiers, that the
number was increased to 30,000. The Bill of Rights declared a
standing army illegal in time of peace; but there is an army
standing at the various sentry-boxes throughout the metropolis.
ARRAIGNMENT. Calling an accused person to the bar, to say
whether he is guilty or not guilty, when he is generally urged to
say the latter, though he may be, willing to confess to the former ;
for the law loves a quibble so much, that it will not have the plain
truth, if there be any means of getting the opposite. When a man
was arraigned, he was told, to hold up his hand, which might have
been a good practice with regard to a pickpocket, for, says Ghotius,
the Court could see, by his holding up his hand, if he were one of
the light-fingered gentry. -
Assent, Roy AL. The right of saying yes, which is sometimes
dictated by the fear of saying otherwise. The royal assent is
usually given by commission, and the clerk of the Parliament is
compelled to repeat some Norman-French ; but as some of these
clerks have, on economical principles, attempted to acquire French
without a master, they often make a sad mess of it. CRomwell, the
Protector, who tried to protect the King's English, did away with
the custom of assenting to a Bill in French ; but at the restoration
the old barbarous method was restored, and prevails at the present
moment.
The Hiero of a Hundred Razzias.
TheRE is a report that Bugeaud is to leave Africa. His successor, who-
ever he may be, will have a difficult task in wielding the torch and sabre
after him. Only think of the Marshal's noble achievements. On the smallest
computation he has conquered 3000 camels, put to the sword 10,000
cocks and hens, captured at least a million sheep, and taken ABD-EL-RADER
prisoner no less than 272 times. What more can his successor do? unless,
perchance, he has the good fortune to kill ABD-EL-KADER twice as often.
We look forward with the strongest interest to his first bulletin.

MRS, CAUDLE “HAS BEEN TOLD " THAT CAUDLE HAS “TAKEN TO

H, you're very late to-night, dear. It’s not late 2
Well, then, it isn’t, that’s all. Of course, a woman
can never tell when it’s late. You were late
on Tuesday, too : a little late on the Friday before;
on the Wednesday before that—now, you needn't
V twist about in that manner; I’m not going to say
º anything—no ; for I see it’s now no use. Once, I
\, own, it used to fret me when you staid out; but
that’s all over: you’ve now brought me to that
state, Cauble-and it’s your own fault, entirely—
---, that I don't care whether you ever come home or

so little of you; but you’ve done it: you’ve been
treading on the worm for these twenty years, and it’s turned

this bed. All I want of you is—any other man would speak to his
wife, and not lie there like a log-all I want is this. . Just tell me
where you were on Tuesday You were not at dear mother's,
though you know she's not well, and you know she thinks of leaving
the dear children her money; but you never had any feeling for
anybody belonging to me. And you were not at your Club : no, I
know that. And you were not at any theatre. How do I know?
Ha, MR. CAUDLE I only wish I didn't know. No ; you were not at
any of these places; but I know well enough where you were.
Then why do I ask, if I know * That's it: just to prove what a
hypocrite you are : just to show you that you can't deceive me.
“So, Mn. CAUDLE—you’ve turned billiard-player, sir. Only once 2
That’s quite enough : you might as well play a thousand times ; for
you’re a lost man, CAUDLE. Only once, indeed. I wonder, if I was
to say ‘Only once, what would you say to me? But, of course, a
man can do no wrong in anything.
“And you’re a lord of the creation, Mn. CAUDLE ; and you can
stay away from the comforts of your blessed fireside, and the society
of your own wife and children—though, to be sure, you never thought
anything of them—to push ivory balls about with a long stick upon
a green table-cloth. What pleasure any man can take in such stuff
must astonish any sensible woman.' I pity you, CAUDLE I
“And you can go and do nothing but make “cannons'—for that’s
the gibberish, they talk at billiards—when there’s the manly and
athletic game of cribbage, as my poor grandmother used to call it,
at your own hearth. You can go into a billiard-room—you, a
respectable tradesman, or as you set yourself up for one, for if the
world knew all, there's very little respectability in you—you can go
and play billiards with a set of creatures in mustachios, when you
might take a nice, quiet hand with me at home. But no anything
but eribbage with your own wife
“CAUDLE, it's all over now ; you’ve gone to destruction. I never
knew a man enter a billiard-room that he wasn’t lost for ever.
There was my uncle WARDLE ; a better man never broke the bread
of life : he took to billiards, and he didn't live with aunt a month
afterwards. A lucky fellow 2 And that's what you call a man who
leaves his wife—a ‘Iucky fellow'? But, to be sure, what can I
expect? We shall not be together long, now : it’s been some time
coming, but, at last, we must separate: and the wife I’ve been to
ou !
“But I know who it is ; it's that fiend, PRETTY MAN. I will call
him a fiend, and I’m by no means a foolish woman : you’d no more
have thought of billiards than a goose, if it hadn't been for him.
Now, it’s no use, CAUDLE, your telling me that you’ve only been
once, and that you can't hit a ball anyhow—you'll soon get over all
that ; and then you'll never be at home. You'll be a marked man,
CAUDLE ; yes, marked : there’ll be something about you that’ll be
dreadful ; for if I couldn't tell a billiard-player by his looks, I've no
eyes, that 's all. They all of 'em look as yellow as parchment, and
wear mustachios—I suppose you’ll let yours grow, now ; though
they’ll be a good deal troubled to come, I know that. Yes, they’ve
all a yellow and sly look; just for all as if they were first-cousins to
people that picked pockets. And that will be your case, CAUDLE :
in six months, the dear children won't know their own father.
“Well, if I know myself at all, I could have borne anything but
billiards. The companions you’ll find . The Captains that will be
always borrowing fifty pounds of you ! I tell you, CAUDLE, a billiard-
room’s a place where ruin of all sorts is made easy, I may say, to the
lowest understanding, so you can't miss it. It’s a chapel of ease for
the devil to preach in-don't tell me not to be eloquent : I don't
know what you mean, Mn. CAUDLE, and I shall be just as eloquent
as I like. But I never can open my lips—and it is n't often, good-
mess knows l—that I'm not insulted.
“No, I won't be quiet on this matter; I won't, CAUDI.E: on any
other, I wouldn't say a word—and you know it—if you didn't like it ;
but on this matter, I will speak. I know you can't play at billiards;
and never could learn—I dare say not ; but that makes it all the
worse, for look at the money you’ll lose; see the ruin you’ll be
brought to... It's no use your telling me you'll not play—now you
can’t help it. And nicely you’ll be eaten up. Don't talk to me;
dear aunt told me all about it. The lots of fellows that go every day
into billiard-rooms to get their dinners, just as a fox sneaks into a
farm-yard to look about him for a fat goose-and they'll eat you up,
CAUDLE ; I know they will.
“Billiard-balls, indeed Well, in my time, I’ve been over Wool-
wich Arsenal—you were something like a man, then, for it was just
before we were married—and then, I saw all sorts of balls; moun-
tains of 'em, to be shot away at churches, and into people's peaceable
habitations, breaking the china, and nobody knows what—I say,
I’ve seen all these balls—well, I know I’ve said that before; but I
choose to say it again—and there's not one of 'em, iron as they are,
that could do ſhalf the mischief of a billiard-ball. That's a ball,
CAUDLE, that’s gone clean through many a wife's heart, to say
nothing of her children. And that’s a ball, that night and day
you'll be destroying your family with. Don't tell me you'll not
play . When a man’s once given to it—as my poor aunt used to
say—the devil's always tempting him with a ball, as he tempted
Eve with an apple.
“I shall never think of being happy any more. No : that’s quite
out of the question. You’ll be there every night—I know you will,
better than you, so don't deny it—every night over that wicked
green cloth. Green, indeed . It's red, crimson red, CAUDLE, if you
could only properly see it—crimson red, with the hearts those balls
have broken. Don't tell me not to be pathetic—I shall : as pathetic
as it suits me. I suppose I may speak. However, I’ve done. It's
all settled now, You're a billiard-player, and I’m a wretched
woman.”
“I did not deny either position,” writes CAUDLE, “and for this
reason—I wanted to sleep.”
THE CIRCUIT OF THE "BUSSES.
The City Omnibusses are still going the circuit. Business with them
has been very dull, for persons who are in a hurry to get from Pic-
cadilly to the Haymarket do not like being carried round the Regent's
Park, whilst an excursion into Holborn and Covent Garden is not found,
upon trial, to be the shortest cut from Temple Bar to the Bank. Several
old gentlemen, who are in the habit of riding to the City every morning,
have adopted the plan of getting out of the omnibus at Fetter Lane, and
waiting for it as it comes into its usual track again at Farringdon Street.
During this long interval of time they quietly take their breakfasts; and on
their return home they dine. This arrangement of filling up a tedious hour
has become so popular, that most of the omnibusses have been obliged to
adopt the theatrical system of giving checks to persons who go out and
intend to come in again; and it is now usual for a cad to ask of every
passenger who steps out, “Do you return, sir?” This plan will be kept
up as long as the exhibition of the sewers continues open in Fleet Street
from morning to dusk.
The Blessed Privileges of Englishmen.
The borough of Woodstock is again vacant. The Duke of MARL-
Borough has declared, unless a candidate instantly presents himself, he
will put his butler, or one of his flunkies, in nomination. His Grace
had] an interview with both those gentlemen, and was rejoiced to
hear that their views upon the present state of affairs agreed so com-
pletely with his own. If anything, His Grace gives the preference to his
flunky, as he has the advantage of stuttering to such a degree, that it is
with the greatest difficulty he can say anything beyond “yes” and “no.”
We may already congratulate the eloquent gentleman on his election as
the member for Woodstock. º

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A BRIGHTON NIGHT ENTERTAINMENT.
BY “PUNCH's” COMMISSIONER.
HAve always had a taste for the second-rate in
life. Second-rate poetry, for instance, is an un-
common deal pleasanter to my fancy than your
great thundering first-rate epic poems. Your
MILTONs and DANTEs are magnificent, but a
bore : whereas an ode of HoRACE, or a song of
ToMMY MooRE, is always fresh, sparkling, and
welcome. Second-rate claret, again,is notoriously
better than first-rate wine: you get the former
genuine, whereas the latter is a loaded and
artificial composition that cloys the palate and
bothers the reason.
Second-rate beauty in women is likewise, I
maintain, more agreeable than first-rate charms.
Your first-rate Beauty is grand, severe, awful—
a faultless, frigid angel of five feet nine—superb
to behold at church, or in the park, or at a drawing-room—but ah! how
inferior to a sweet little second-rate creature, with smiling eyes, and a
little second-rate nex retroussé, with which you fall in love in a minute.
Second-rate novels I also assert to be superior to the best works of
fiction. They give you no trouble to read, excite no painful emotions—
you go through them with a gentle, languid, agreeable interest. MR.
JAMEs's romances are perfect in this way. The ne plus ultra of indolence
may be enjoyed during their perusal.
For the same reason, I like second-rate theatrical entertainments—a
good little company in a provincial town, acting good old stupid stock
comedies and farces; where nobody comes to the theatre, and you may
lie at ease in the pit, and get a sort of intimacy with each actor and
actress, and know every bar of the music that the three or four fiddlers
of the little orchestra play throughout the season.
- The Brighton Theatre would be admirable but for one thing—MR.
Hooper, the Manager, will persist in having Stars down from London—
blazing MacREADys, resplendent Miss CushMANs, fiery WALLAcks, and the
like. On these occasions it is very possible that the house may be filled
and the Manager's purpose answered; but where does all your comfort go
then You can't loll over four benches in the pit—you are squeezed and
hustled in an inconvenient crowd there—you are fatigued by the perpetual
struggles of the apple-and-ginger-beer boy, who will pass down your row
—and for what do you undergo this labour? To see Hamlet and Lady
Macbeth, forsooth ! as if everybody had not seen them a thousand times.
No, on such star nights “The Commissioner” prefers a walk on the Cliff to
the charms of the Brighton Theatre. I can have first-rate tragedy in
London: in the country give me good old country fare—the good old
comedies and farces—the dear good old melodramas.
We had one the other day in perfection. We were, I think, about four
of us in the pit ; the ginger-beer boy might wander about quite at his
ease. There was a respectable family in a private box, and some plea-
sant fellows in the gallery; and we saw, with leisure and delectation, that
famous old melodrama, The Warlock of the Glen.
In a pasteboard cottage, on the banks of the Atlantic Ocean, there
lived once a fisherman, who had a little canvass boat, in which it is a
wonder he was never swamped, for the boat was not above three feet
long; and I was astonished at his dwelling in the cottage, too; for,
though a two-storied one, it was not above five feet high.; and I am sure
the fisherman was six feet without his shoes.
As he was standing at the door of his cot, looking at some young per-
sons of the neighbourhood who were dancing a reel, a scream was heard,
as issuing from the neighbouring forest, and a lady with dishevelled hair,
and a beautiful infant in her hand, rushed in. What meant that scream :
We were longing to know, but the gallery insisted on the reel over
again, and the poor injured lady had to wait until the dance was done
before she could explain her unfortunate case.
It was briefly this: she was no other than Adela, Countess of Glen-
cairn: the boy in her hand was, Glencairn's only child: three years
since her gallant husband had fallen in fight, or, worse still, by the hand
of the assassin.
He had left a brother, Clanronald. What was the conduct of that
surviving relative Was it fraternal towards the widowed Adela 2 Was
it avuncular to the orphan boy? Ah, no For three years he had
locked her up in his castle, under pretence that she was mad, pursuing
her all the while with his odious addresses. But she loathed his suit; and,
refusing to become Mrs. (or Lady) Clanronald, took this opportunity to
* * fling herself on the protection of the loyal vassals of
lel' Iord.
She had hardly told her pathetic tale when voices were heard without
Cries of “Follow! follow!” resounded through the wildwood; the gentlemen
and ladies engaged in the reel fled, and the Countess and her child, step-
ping into the skiff, disappeared down a
slote, to the rage and disappointment of
Clanronald, whonow arrived—asavage-
looking nobleman indeed 1 and followed
by two ruffians, of most ferocious
aspect, and having in their girdles a
pair of those little notched dumpy
swords, with round iron hilts to
guard the knuckles, by which I knew
that a combat would probably take
place ere long. And the result proved
that I was right.
Flying along the wild margent of the
sea, in the next act, the poor Adela was
pursued by Clanronald; but though
she jumped into the waves to avoid him,
the unhappy lady was rescued from the
briny element, and carried back to her
prison; Clanronald swearing a dreadful
oath that she should marry him that
very day.
He meanwhile gave orders to his
two ruffians, Murdoch and Hamish,
to pursue the little boy into the wood, and there—there murder him.
But there is always a power in melodramas that watches over
innocence; and these two wretched ones were protected by THE WARLock
OF THE GLEN.
All through their misfortunes, this
mysterious being watched them with
a tender interest. When the two
ruffians were about to murder the
child, he and the fisherman rescued
him — their battle-swords (after a
brief combat of four) sank powerless
before his wizard staff, and they fled
in terror.
Haste we to the Castle of Glencairn.
What ceremony is about to take
place What has assembled those
two noblemen, and those three ladies
in calico trains A marriage 1 But
what a union 1 The lady Adela is
dragged to the chapel-door by the
truculent Clanronald. “Lady,” he
says, “you are mine. Resistance is
unavailing. Submit with good grace.
Henceforth, what power on earth can
separate you from me?”
“MINE CAN,” cries the Warlock
of the Glen, rushing in. “Tyrant and -
assassinofthy brother! know that Glencairn—Glencairn, thy brother and
lord, whom thy bravos were commissioned to slay—know that, for three
years, a solemn vow (sworn to the villain that spared his life, and expired
yesterday) bound him never to reveal his existence—know that he is near
at hand; and repent, while yet there is time.”
The lady Adela's emotion may be guessed when she heard this news;
but Clanronald received it with contemptuous scepticism. “And where
is this dead man come alive 1° laughed he.
“He is HERE,” shouted the Warlock
of the Glen : , and to fling away
his staff—to dash off his sham beard
and black gown—to appear in a red
dress, with tights and yellow boots, as
became Glencairn's earl—was the work
of a moment. The Countess recognised
him with a scream of joy. Clanronald
retired, led off by two soldiers; and the
joy of the Earl and Countess was com-
pleted by the arrival of their only
son (a clever little girl of the Hebrew
persuasion), in the arms of the fisher-
IIlan.
The curtain fell on this happy scene.
The fiddlers had ere this disappeared.
The ginger-beer boy went home to a
virtuous family, that was probably look-
ing out for him. The respectable family
in the boxes went off in a fly. The little
audience spread abroad, and were lost in
the labyrinths of the city. The lamps of
the Theatre Royal were extinguished: and
all—all was still.

SIR JOHN MARSHALL’S WALNUTS.
A Few days since, at the Rochester Petty Ses-
sions, a boy was sentenced to pay fifteen shillings
for stealing a few walnuts, the property of SIR
John MARs HALL–that wise and good man sitting
on the Bench to see all the rigour of the law pro-
perly inflicted on the wretched culprit. We are
happy to state that CAPTAIN UNDERwood, of Gil-
lingham, has since paid the money, and the boy
is rescued from a gaol. We have heard of a cat
in walnuts. So, it seems, have the shoemakers of
Rochester. Hence, they are about to present to
SIR John MARs HALL a very handsome pair of
shoes, shaped like walnut-shells, that, by wearing
them in and about the town of Rochester, the
remembrance of his merciful goodness may live in
the hearts of all people. “He has worn them well,
and may he wear them long 1"

Rival Exhibitions,
We understand that the Dean and Chapter of St.
Paul's complain bitterly of the loss they experience by
the competition of the Colosseum, where a view of
London is to be had in as perfect a state as from the
outside of the Cathedral. The Colosseum has the
advantage of BRADwell's moon, so that the “show”
from the St. Paul's of the Regent's Park is more effective
than the same view amid all the smoke of the city. The
Cathedral authorities complain of their copyright having
been infringed upon, and insist that the exhibition of the
panorama of the Metropolis is their property. . The
Colosseum proprietors contend, on the other hand, that
by the addition of a moon they have effected such an
improvement as to entitle them to a patent for their
exhibition.

Here’s the
CRUEL TREATMENT OF HER MAJESTY'S SHIPS.
Roused by the numerous accounts we have received, from the different
dockyards and ports, of the inhuman conduct of the Surveyor of the
Navy and his myrmidons towards his offspring, and generally to the un-
fortunate vessels placed under his care, and despairing of any results
from official inquiry, we despatched our own Commissioner to investigate
the facts of the case—and have much pleasure in subjoining his first
report, which will, we doubt not, excite universal indignation against
those who have thus shockingly abused our gallant defenders.
The Victoria and Albert examined.—“Was built at Portsmouth.
Is about two years old. Knows SIR Robert SYMonds. Has good reasons
to know him. Was treated with kindness at first, and handsomely
dressed. , Had as many as three coats of paint, besides gilding.
Was ordered out of harbour last year, when unfit to move. Told
them she was unfit; but was hauled out of dock by force. Resisted
as well as she could, and nearly went aground in the harbour: was
made to move on. Moving caused her great pain : violent wrench-
ings in all her joints, and a sensation of weakness in the boiler.
Doesn’t think she'll ever get over her first attack. The Surveyor
said it was all sham and humbug; that she could go if she liked;
and that, if she didn't, he would trim her. Looked upon that as a
threat. Was always ill-treated from that time ; has had her engines
taken out and put in again; but experienced no relief. If anything,
felt worse after it than before. Had a shortness of steam, which com-
pelled her to stop every two or three hours. Has been in the habit of
rolling about, as if drunk; could not help it: it was from weakness.
All she asks is to be allowed to fall to pieces quietly, as she knows she is
past the doctors. Feels as if she is going fast—except when at sea.”
The poor creature's feeble movements and evident suffering from the
various operations she has been subjected to were painfully apparent
while she was under examination. At the conclusion, she wheezed out
of court with difficulty; and our Commissioner has since heard that she is
laid up from coming here, as, indeed, she always is after the slightest
exertion.
The Vanguard examined.—“Was built at Pembroke; is ten years
old. Always heard SIR Robert SYMonds was her father. Has been in the
Mediterranean. Went as well as she could. Had not her full allowance
of provisions. Complained, but was told it was to make her more active.
Felt very much the worse for that trip. The weather was fine, but
always suffered at sea, whether smooth or not. Is sure she never went
ten knots an hour: whoever says so, says what isn't true : couldn't do
it. When made to go fast, felt as if her back was broke. Has refused
to obey her helm. Thought she had a right to do so—feeling very
uneasy. When she refused to obey her helm she was thrown into the
trough. It was the steersman did it. Hurt herself very much. Was
made to go to sea in July last, with the Superb, the Caucasus, and some
others. Was kept very short of provisions, because she was always
behind the rest. Was abused for swimming deep. Found it very hard
to keep her head above water at all. Hopes she mayn't soon be sent to
sea again. Feels that, if she is made to go out in bad weather, she’ll
soon break up—and doesn't care how soon it is. Has had her head cut
two or three times, but feels as heavy as ever. Has heard them talk
about trimming her. Tried to go ashore once or twice, but wasn't
allowed. Any ship would have tried to go ashore that had been treated
as she had. Wishes there was a war—perhaps she'd be put out of her
misery.”
This poor creature was so unfit for work, she could hardly stand
upright under the slightest canvass; and the way she laboured and
strained, while under examination, was perfectly dreadful.
The Superb examined.— “Was built at Pembroke, in 1842. Was
fitted out in 1843. Wouldn't take her stores on board; refused to do so
because she couldn't carry 'em. Is not quick in her movements, and
was generally unable to keep up with her companions. Has sustained
a severe strain when last out, and feels she ought to be laid up-but
believes they intend getting more work out of her. Doesn't know how
she's to do it. Her frame is weak, and she feels altogether unsound.
Has often wished to be cast away outright. Couldn't well be a greater
wreck than she is at present.”
A greater contrast could not well be imagined, than that afforded by
the miserable trio just mentioned, and a hale old lady, named the
Canopus, who was in court during the investigation, a fine specimen of
French health and agility, though she dates from the last century. She
has been accustomed to travel in company with Vanguard and Superb,
and outstrips invariably her youthful but yet decrepit companions, while
the style in which she stows away her provisions and water excites the
wonder and admiration of all who have seen her. This she owes to her
strength of constitution and the judicious treatment she received while
in the cradle.
We trust the parliament in this country will take some steps to protect
our wooden walls from the dreadful treatment of which the above exami-
nation but imperfectly discloses the appalling particulars.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
VAN AMBURGH'S ELEPHANT, AND THE POET BUNN.
He records of Natural History, already so much
enriched with the anecdotes of the “half-reason-
ing” elephant, have within these past few days re-
ceived a glorious addition to their worth and
interest. WAN AMBURGH has taken himself and his
beasts off to New York. Drury-Lane having closed
its doors against the menagerie, it has been shipped
for the delight of the Americans. This, however,
was not accomplished without considerable difficulty
on the part of the elephant : he would not be coaxed
or comforted. The truth is, during his engagement
a year or two ago, at Drury-Lane Theatre, he hat
taken such an affection for the Poet BUNN, that the
very idea of leaving the country, delighted and ho-
noured by the residence of the Bard, threw the ele-
phant into an intensity of passion known only to elephants. The innocent
reporter chronicles the violence of the elephant, altogether unconscious
of its touching and romantic cause.
We are told that the first attempt to urge him towards St. Katha- t
rine's Docks “was made at three in the morning by the keepers, but
the elephant declined moving.” No : a love for the Poet BUNN–for
the Bard-Manager, who, above all other men, knew what was due to the
true dignity of brutes, and therefore flung open the doors of Drury-Lane
to them—this love tugged at the heart-strings of the elephant, and made
him pause. He had eaten the oranges of BUNN–he had partaken of his
biscuits—he had chewed his trusses of hay, and, with a gratitude
towards a manager rare among those whe walk the stage, he could not
without emotion quit London, the home of his protector and friend.
Any of our unprejudiced readers who have visited the Zoological Gardens,
must have remarked the affection of the elephant for a bunn ; it seems
an instinct born with the animal, albeit never so strongly, so touchingly
developed as in this last instance of the elephant of WAN AMBURGH, as
shown in the following :—
“Finding he would not be led quietly along, the keepers, with the assistance of VAN
AM burgh's men, chained his twofore legs together, and then, attaching a rope to them,
I. it round his body and fastened the end to his hind legs. They then fastened two
ong ropes to each of his fore legs, and about fifty men then commenced dragging him
along, while two keepers were behind with pikes pricking him forward, and one on
each side occupied in a similar manner.”
No : the noble animal thought of his triumphs at Drury-Lane ; he re-
membered the suavity and intelligence of the Manager, so peculiarly gifted
for the patron of a menagerie; and it took fifty men to {. him on—to
say nothing of the three spirited individuals with pikes, tenderly “pricking
him forward.” It is only the few who remember the extraordinary affec-
tion developed on a certain occasion by the elephant towards BuNN, who
can thoroughly sympathise with the lacerated and bleeding animal. The
story is not so well known, as, for the honour of elephants, it should be.
It is this. The visitors of the theatre were wont to bestow sixpences
upon the elephant, with which he bought cakes and oranges. It was,
however, at the time a subscription for one of the fifty pieces of plate
given to BUNN was set afoot, that the elephant unfailingly set aside six-
pence per diem. This custom he continued for two-and-forty days. He
then, with a gentle waving of his trunk, motioned to John Cooper, who
was going round with a tambourine for the cash. John approached,
when the elephant, with a sagacity that will not surprise those who
thoroughly know the animal, rang down, one by one, the two-and-forty
sixpences in the tambourine, and then gave another flourish of his trunk,
as much as to say, “There, John ; there's my guinea for the subscrip-
tion. MR. BUNN has done #. deal for me, and I hope I'm grateful.”
That the elephant's name did not appear among the list of subscribers,
was only another instance of man's ingratitude to the brute ereation,
seeing that the animal had quite as much reason on his side, for what he
did, as any of his biped fellow-performers.
However, to return to the removal of the elephant. He was at length
coaxed “to go on board the Toronto, which,” adds the account, “he did
very peaceably.” Notwithstanding, we are certain of it, the brute
will never survive his separation from Drury-Lane. He will die on the
passage ; and if his anatomy be opened, there will be found, printed in
largest play-bill letters on his heart—“THE PoET BUNN 1”.
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
Assign AT. A bit of paper, of about the value of a Pennsylvanian
bond, which was all the French Republic had to meet its liabilities.
It is said that in 1795, when the five Directors went to the Luxem-
bourg, there was not a bit of furniture in the place, and the door-
keeper lent them a ricketty table. Some say there were also two
stools in the Luxembourg, between which the five Directors fell to
the around. -
Attain pen, from the Latin word attinctus, stained ; for, says
Seldes, an attainder is a stain on a man's character; but the
pardon of the Sovereign, like salts of lemon, will take the stain
out again. -
Attorney, from attornaire, to substitute, means one put in
another's place; and an Attorney often comes into that which
belonged to his client. An Attorney cannot practise without a cer-
tificate, which he pays for every year, like a license to kill game, to
which his occupation bears some analogy. An Attorney, before he
can be admitted, is examined as to what books he has read Î and
here is a case of a clerk having answered that he had read
Robinson Crusoe twice, and Punch every Saturday. - -
BAILIFF, from bailler, to sweep; because a Bailiff generally
sweeps away or brushes off one's property. Bailiffs are sometimes
called Stewards, and manors always had Bailiffs; “but,” says
SPELMAN, “there have been baylyffes with noe mannerres.”
Bailiwick. A place in which John DoE and Richaºn Roſſ.
used to be continually running up and down, till the abolition of
arrest for debt deprived them of this very healthy exercise. -
BALLot, Vote by. The power of saying one thing and doing
another; or of receiving a bribe from two different parties, and
supporting neither. -
BANK. The general terminus for nearly all the London omnibusses.
The Bank parlour is a snug little apartment, fitted up expressly for
“the Governor.” The popular song, “I know a Bank," was sup-
posed to have been written by SHAkspeaRE, on his going to receive
his dividends.
BARBARIAN, from 'barba, the beard, because a barbarian never
shaved himself. The present fashion of wearing
the hair longer behind than it was ever known to
be worn before, is decidedly barbarous. Stn. Abo
thinks barbarians were those who made indistinct
sounds, which the Greeks could not understand ; but
this is just like STRAbo, who squinted so terribly,
that he took a one-sided view of everything, and a
squint has been called strabismus, from STRAbo,
ever afterwards.
BARoN. A title of honour, such as BARoN
BRough AM, BARon NATHAN, and other distin-
guished characters. BARoN NATHAN is not the
only person of his rank who has been a teacher, for
the Barons in the time of John gave the King such
a lesson, as the country still profits by even at this remote period.
BAmonet. A little Baron ; a title which originated with KING
JAMEs THE FInst, who, being short of money, and being the foun-
tain of honour, drew it off from the fountain, like ginger-beer, at so
much a draught, to any one willing to pay for it. The title of
Baronet gives precedence over Commoners; but it is doubtful
whether a Baronet, trying to get into the pit of the Opera with the
rush, would find people fall back to allow him the precedence he is
entitled to.
A NICE Point.
The Bishop of Exeter has given it as his opinion that a clergyman
speculating in railways comes under the statute against “dealing for gain
or profit.” As the statute only says dealing—and railway speculation in-
volves rather shuffling than dealing—some of the reverend Stags maintain
that they do not violate the Act of Parliament.
A FORLORN Hope.
The Constitutionnel says, that the French medical men have ordered
to Algeria persons afflicted with pulmonary disease. It is quite clear that
human beings are sent to Algeria for rapid consumption.
TAKE DOWN THE ADDRESS,
The newspapers are full of advertisements about—“WANTED, several
first-rate Levellers.” We advise all railway companies to apply at
Conciliation Hall.

OF
THE GRAND POLITICAL RAILWAY.
(PEEL'S LINE.)
This line is proposed to open a direct communication between the
Whig and Tory termini, with branches to numerous points on the
High Conservative Road, and extensions into several of the Liberal
provinces. The great disposition that has recently been shown for
an approximation between the two great extremes of party, have
rendered this line a national necessity; and, indeed, it is intended
to do by a direct course what has hitherto been partially attempted
in a roundabout manner.
It would be easy to show a statistical statement of the traffic that
may be expected upon this line, for it is calculated that it must be
greatly frequented by Members of Parliament, who, instead of
taking their principles and other heavy goods by the usual circuitous
route, across a vast tract of political country, will at once avail them-
selves of the advantages that PEEL's line offers them. The ground
has been surveyed; and, though the gradients are severe, the diffi-
culties may be overcome, so as to prevent the ups and downs on the
line from being too sudden and precipitous.
It has been calculated that Corn alone will cause a tremendous
traffic on the Political Railway; occasioning a constant transit to
and fro between nearly every point on the projected Railway.
There will be no difficulty about the cuttings, for the fact of its
being PEEL's line is a guarantee that he will make his cuttings as
short as possible.
Most of the persons located along the political line are believed
to be decidedly favourable to the proposed Railway, because it admits
of a rapid transition from one point to another, and back again, if
necessary, without inconvenience. The only opposition that is
anticipated, will possibly arise from the agricultural interests, which
are always slow to move, and have been prejudiced against PEEL's
line; but it is hoped that by putting some of their friends upon the
direction, and giving them an interest in the success of the scheme,
their hostility will be got rid of.
Applications for shares, which will only be allotted to those who
have Parliamentary scrip in some of the established political lines,
may apply to the Sechet Any of STATE, at the Home Office.
A HOME FOR JACK RETCH.
A common objection of short-sighted persons to any new invention, or
legislative improvement, is the number of individuals whose interests it
is likely to injure. There are, however, beautiful provisions, in the nature
of things, for the compensation of those affected by such changes. Many a
guard of former days is now a stoker, or a railway policeman ; and
omnibus extension has been coincident with the decline of stage-coaches.
The large abolition of capital punishments which took place a few years
ago, raised, doubtless, in many a considerate, but contracted mind, the
uestion—“What is to become of the poor Hangmen?” Little thought
the anxious querists that their difficulty was in course of solution all the
while. In the union-workhouses which now cover the land have asylums
been provided for the Finishers of the Law. The same talents, the same
turn of mind, which once led their possessor to officiate on the scaffold, are
now his qualifications for the mastership of the workhouse. -
By these he is fitted for his situation; devoid of them, he is incompe-
tent to it. No weak mercy must restrain him from doing his duty, on
pain of dismissal. His unflinching infliction of the sentence of the law
will, on the other hand, cover a multitude of transgressions. AGERs, the
Master of the Hungerford Workhouse, gave the wretches consigned to
him too much bread. He was sent about his business instantly. His
brother official at Andover did his work thoroughly. He was accused, of
peculation, and divers enormities. Long was the investigation of his
conduct; many were the expedients adopted to screen him. ...Tardily,
reluctantly, in deference to the general outcry, he was at last dismissed.
This professional efficiency endeared him to his employers. Attached to
the Tower there was once a functionary called the “Sworn Tormentor.”
An equivalent office exists in the Poor Law Bastille. Its master is bound
to carry out the law framed “to torment the poor.” He is still an Execu-
tioner. The workhouse is the refuge of the destitute Jack Ketch.
A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER,
We never understood the use of the Unicorn in the Royal Arms;
The British Lion is frequently in everybody's mouth, and is an especial
favourite with orators after dinner, who trot him out on the smallest
pretence. At Exeter Hall, too, he is always kept ready to be brought
on the platform at a moment's notice; and agriculturists are very fond
of making the British Lion roar on every possible occasion. But the
British Unicorn has no voice in the country—“His name is never
heard.”. Who ever recollects the British Unicorn being called upon at a
public dinner to save the Constitution? His existence, in fact, is a nullity,
and his influence precisely the same. Accordingly we suggest that the
British Stag, who is making at present such a stir all over the world—
changing even the very surface of society as well as that of the globe–
should take the stand of the Unicorn, for the future, on the Royal Arms.
He is the representative of a large and a growing class, and is so intimately
connected with every railway, that his influence may be said to extend
over every county of England. The Stags, in fact, may be called the
“Fifth Estate;” and, considering it is an estate that is built more or less
upon everybody else's, it is time it should be recognised and properly
represented. His dominion, even, has lately been proclaimed in India;
and we predict that in a short time the sun will never set upon the
possessions of the British Stag. We hope, then, that the Gazette will
soon contain an Order in Council that the Stag be established henceforth
as a supporter of the Arms of England, vice the Unicorn, dismissed.
Lost OR STRAYED.—Whereas the Railway Board of Trade has
not been heard of for months, any one who can give information as to its present
locality, will materially oblige a large circle of Stags, who are most anxious to know
whether the said Board is still in existence. If so, it is earnestly implored to com-
municate instantly with its disconsolate friends in Capel Court.

cuTELY feeling that Ma.
O'Conn ELL has-and when
has he not —right upon his
side in his complaints of the
reports of the Times' Com-
missioner, who has unques-
tionably painted the Emerald
Isle as black as printers' ink
can make it, Punch, with his
characteristic spirit and hu-
manity, despatched a gentle-
man to Ireland, that the true
thing might at last be made
apparent to all men. Punch,
knowing how very much a
man's wisdom depends upon
, his personal beauty—SocRA-
- TEs himself, as it is well
known, being far handsomer
than ALCIBIADEs—resolved
to employ no Commissioner
whose outward appearance
was not even of a dangerous
loveliness to all women who
might look upon him. To
come at this ADoNIs cost
Punch no little pains; but at length the difficulty was achieved, and
MR. NARcissus PINK, a bashful barrister, six feet two in his patent
leather boots, with whiskers thick as myrtle bushes, auburn hair, eye-
brows like CUPID's own bent bow, a model of a nose, eyes fascinating
as a snake's, and above all, a smile, that—but for the owner's rigid
principles of honour—might be considered, a disturber of the peace
of families, MR. NARcissus PINK, we say, endowed and adorned with
all these graces, has been sent by us to Ireland; and, to the con-
fusion of the Times' Commissioner, has forwarded to us the subjoined.
We may as well state, for the information of MR. O'Con NELL, that
our Commissioner has always, been known in England as PINK THE
BEAUTY. He will, of course, never return to England; the Irish
ladies will take good care of that.
[From our Own Commissioner.]
“BALLY MUckANFILTH, Oct. 14.—I arrived at this beautiful and
picturesque village—but what village throughout all this lovely land,
for lovely it is, despite of the Union, is not beautiful and picturesque
—late last evening. I put up at the Shamrock, a small but luxu-
rious inn, whose cleanliness and taste contended for the mastery.
The hostess is one of those bewitching, inexpressible
creatures, so common among the humblest classes of this
T fairy-like country. She has one of those faces, beaming
&S 7 and bursting with intelligence, to be found, particularly,
§ Nºs in the ſºlº ºf Mººi...º.º.
*faces that to look upon is to feelyourself elevated conside-
rably beyond humanity. My heart would have flown from me, but
that, whilst she gracefully stirred my jug of whisky-punch, my eye
fell upon her wedding-finger—I saw she was another's. But go where
you will, it is the same. I have not seen an ugly face throughout the
land 1 All—all the women are angels. I have met with three female
cases of small-pox : and never did I think it possible that small-pox,
with us so defacing, could to the Irish female coun-
tenance impart such inexpressible loveliness. Red hair
has always been my particular aversion. , Alas! I never
knew the romance that lurked in red hair until this
moment. The chambermaid has, I find, red hair. Upon
an English head it would be horrid. On Biddy
M’MAHoN, for such is her name, it burns like a crown
of glory.
“This morning, after breakfast—and what a breakfast
I had the hens, to be sure, lay very small eggs, but
this is all owing to the Union—after breakfast, I sallied
forth into the village. It was very beautiful. The spirits of content-
ment and cleanliness seemed presiding over it. The road was neatly
paved with small stones, for as yet they have not introduced the
luxury of the pacé. All the houses have neat slate roofs, with com-
fortable casements, and are all—save when the house is of nice yellow
brick—spotlessly whitewashed. To be sure, there is at every door
a dungheap. Now, a dunghill in England is an offensive, footid
thing—at least, to my nose. How very different are the dungheaps
in Ireland 1 They positively steam with sweetest odours; to which
circumstance may, I think, be attributed the lovely complexion and
seraphic looks of the swarms of children that abound in every
village. They are all, too, so scrupulously clean-and so comfort-
ably clothed.
“I went into several of the cottages and—next to being struck with
the surpassing loveliness of the daughters, the mother, the grand-
mother, and in many cases the great-grandmother—I was always
astonished at the extreme neatness of the furniture, the comfortable
look of all around me. Next to being the loveliest women in the
world, the Irish are certainly the cleanest.
“In almost every cottage, they keep one or two pigs. Now, the
first impression of the reader will doubtless be, that such a custom
cannot conduce to the cleanliness of the homestead. With an
English pig, certainly not : but Irish pigs—with the quick genius of
their country—know what is due to the courtesies of life, and
behave accordingly. It is well known that, of all the saints, Sr.
PATRIck only was a gentleman: I know not how it is, but the spirit
of the saint seems here to pervade all animal life.
“It may be asked, then, what does this country want? I answer,
nothing—nothing but Repeal | Destroy the Union, and you gild the
refined gold of Erin—you give a perfume to her very shamrocks
Frolicsome, and lovely, and clean, and seemingly happy as are the
men and women of this enchanting country, it has not escaped the
acute eye of your Commissioner, that, even in the wildest evolutions
of the Irish hornpipe, there has lurked a something melancholy,–in
the most glorious radiancy of Irish female beauty there has been a
something sad—in the cleanest places a certain spot—in the most
uproarious joviality, a suppressed groan—and this melancholy, this
sadness, this spot, this suppressed note of suffering—has all been
owing to the absorbing want of repeal. The very rooks of Ireland
caw ‘repeal,”—the very sparrows in Dublin streets chirp it.”
We trust, after this, that MR. O'Conn ELL will be satisfied that
something like justice has been done by even a Saxon Commissioner
to Ould Ireland. If the portrait of MR. NARcIssus PINK, or PINK
THE BEAUTY, do not in due time adorn the walls of Conciliation Hall,
gratitude is dead among its patriots and orators.
CLERICAL EXAMPLE.
A SAD mischance has happened to one JAMEs Holywell, “employed
to show the crypt at St. Paul's Cathedral.” The said JAMEs has been
called to the bar of the Police Court of Southwark, and “charged with
committing an assault of an aggravated description on HANNAH STEPHENs,
a young woman.” JAMEs, it will be perceived, is, in a small degree, a
churchman : he is one of the money-takers at one of our Cathedrals—a
necessary officer to the Dean and Chapter. He has been weighed in the
scales of Southwark justice, and found wanting. At this moment—for he
could not pay the fine imposed upon him—he may be attempting the diffi-
cult steps of the tread-mill. We think the magistrate doomed the offender
without sufficiently considering the influence of example. For who shall
deny how much the principles of JAMEs have been deteriorated by the sad
example of his clerical betters, the BLUNTs and the WETHERALLs, in the
higher places of the temple :

“In the present age of enlightenment,” as our tea-dealer says when he
wants us to try his three-and-sixpenny mixed, which, by-the-bye, we have
tried, and we don't like it;-” in the present age of enlightenment,” we
are surprised that the public spirit which pervades everything should be
neglecting the demand that must eventually arise for an Asylum for
Railway Lunatics. We think that the insanity, which must be in exist-
ence, to start the variety of new, impracticable, and useless schemes that
are already suggested, will eventually require some vast asylum to contain
it ; and we congratulate Parliament on having passed lunacy laws just
before they are likely to be wanted. . We give a design for a Railway
Lunatic Asylum, which should be a kind of general terminus to many of
the new schemes that are advertised.
PUNCH'S CODE FOR HUSBANDS AND WIVES.
HE Chinese have a custom of reducing good and
e bad actions to a scale of rewards and punish-
ments. We think a similar plan of prizes
and penalties would answer equally well in
England. With this conviction, we have drawn
out the following (code for the use of English
families, and we strongly advise the Mr. and
Mrs. Caudles of England to have it framed
and hung in every room of their house, that it
may always be easy of reference. Should it
become the law of the land, it will have the
good effect of making married people settle
their quarrels at home; for under our code,
sentence once passed, there is no appeal, not even to one's mother-in-law.
In the framing of the laws, we have been assisted by a Committee of
Widows and Widowers, in order that no undue partiality should be
shown on either side. It has since undergone the revision of a magistrate
who has had twenty years' adjudication of matrimonial fracas, and may
accordingly be pronounced perfect:-

ADVICE TO CREDITORS.
Those individuals who have money owing to them, and have for some
time entirely lost sight of their debtors, need no longer remain in that
unfortunate predicament, for it is only necessary to run one's eye down a
list of Railway Directors, and a few of the names that have long been on
the Tradesmen's Black List will be found paraded in all the pomp of
Provisional Committeeship. Another advantage attending the discovery is,
that, when they are pounced upon, they are in a position of the very highest
ability to meet all demands, for most of them stand pledged to find capital,
to the tune of some fifty or a hundred thousand pounds, for the comple-
tion of great railway undertakings, from which their country will expe-
rience so much benefit, that they must be considered less as projectors
than as patriots. We may be asked, if such is our confidence in the
Railway Directors, that we would buy any of what have been considered
their bad debts? We think the question scarcely fair; but if a farthing
in the pound would answer the expectations of some of the creditors, we
should not object to speculate.

SENSIBILITY OF LOUIS-PHILIPPE.
The Epoque, French paper, says that the KING “was so affected with

Kader, that “he ordered the concert to be postponed : " This is very
pathetic. When, however, a few hundreds of Arabs—men, women, and
children—were roasted alive by the gallant PEliss ER in the caves of
Dahra, was not Te Deum chanted in thanksgiving for the burning

A SCAMPER THROUGH WESTM INSTER ABBEY.
We wonder that the Guide-Book, sold by the bookseller who sits on
the spikes on the outside of Poet's Corner, is not called “A Scamper
through Westminster Abbey”; for such in reality is the visit that, since
the reduction of prices, one is allowed to pay to the venerable and
interesting structure. We went the other day to take advantage of the
liberality of the Dean and Chapter, by seeing the show at a moderate
figure; but we found that the quickness of the return is made to com-
pensate for the smallness of the profit. The Werger went away at a
slapping pace, closely followed by a foreigner, eager to catch the descrip-
tions of the monuments, as we rushed past them at a railroad pace; and
the official, by the time we got half round the building, was so completely
|º p

º
out of breath, and was puffing away at such an enormous rate, that he
had no wind left to puff the sculpture.
The corpulent and the family men stand no chance whatever; for, with
a little child to drag and a wife to conduct, it is hopeless to try to catch
any of those graphic bits of History that drop from the Werger's mouth,
ready cut and dried from the pages of the Guide-Book.
A sentimental student, who was endeavouring to read the classical
inscriptions through an opera-glass, was so completely distanced, that he
sunk exhausted on the tomb-stone of ABBAs, where he was swept up the
next morning by the Dean and Chapter's charwoman.
PUNCH'S RAILWAY REVIEW.
WHILE everybody else is allowing his time and capital to be
absorbed by Railways, Punch, disdaining the filthy lucre of Capel
Court, wanders in the pleasant fields of Railway Literature, and
intends creating himself into a Board of Trade, to review the
merits- not of the schemes themselves—but of their numerous
Prospectuses.
We commence our intended series of criticisms by a notice of the
Prospectus of the Somersetshire and North Devon Junction. The
first line is exceedingly imaginative, and talks of “a capital of
600,000l.,” a bold figure, which bespeaks a wildness of conception
that it will be rather difficult to realise. The opening paragraph of
the prospectus takes a very daring flight, and leads us through some
out-of-the-way places, into which the wildest fancy and the most
errant donkey never yet travelled. It carries the speculator's
imagination into Nether Stowey, Wachet, Dunster, Old Cleeve,
Stoke Pero, West Porlock, and Parracombe, places which we
never heard of, but which we are told comprise “a range of
country at present totally deprived of Railway communication.”
The same might be said of the top of Mont Blanc, the fag-end of the
North Pole, the Centre of Gravity, and other places, with which we
are about as familiar as we are with Old Cleeve, Stoke Pero, West
Porlock, and Parracombe.
In looking at the map, we find that the places through which the
proposed line is to pass are lofty mountains, inaccessible peaks, and
precipitous rocks.
So far, the prospectus speaks only of local interests; but the second
paragraph touches on the larger subjects of history and politics. It
points out the advantages which the Railway presents in a national
point of view, which, we are told, “cannot fail to ensure the consent
of Parliament to the line in question.” The paragraph is, however,
so gloriously and deliciously droll—there is such a right-rollicking,
rampancy in every word—that we give the clause of the prospectus
entire :—
“The advantages which this Railway presents, in amational point of view, are of great
importance, and cannot ſail to ensure the consent of Parliament to the Line in question.
It is evidently a Coast Line, and is connected with the remarkable historical fact, that in
the reign of Alf RED THE GREAT, the vicinity of this line of coast was the seat of an
actual invasion by the Danes, under Hump A, their leader; but, to the honour of the
brave men of Devon, that hostile armament was totally destroyed, their Chief, Hubna,
slain with all his followers, and their supposed invincible standard, Reaſan, taken.
Supposing, therefore, that a modern or future Hugº A should attempt a renewal of
invasion on this line of coast, what other fate could he expect in the face of a whole
nation, eager and hastening to receive him * Such are the advantages of defence which
Railways afford to distant and apparently unprotected coasts.”
Fancy an army of shareholders rushing to resist a modern HuBBA:
The Line should be called the “Somersetshire and HuBBA-Resisting
Grand Junction Railway;” for if part of its value consists in its
being a panacea against any future HUBBA, the fact should not be
omitted in the title of the Railway.
Arrangements, we are told, are in progress for the “extension of
the Provisional Committee.” We should say that the Provisional
Committee would go to any lengths, that is to say, admit of any
extension whatever. In another paragraph, the prospectus tells us,
in a dashing, off-hand style, that “the statistics of the traffic in coal,
iron, lead, and mineral ores, &c. &c., present a favourable result ;”
but how, why, or when, we are not informed by the projectors or
projector of the Railway. “A certain number of shares will be
reserved for the local interest,” facetiously says the prospectus; but
as the Railway is to run along the tops of craggy peaks, we know of
no local interest except that which the Chamois, and perhaps also
the (Railway) Stag, may take in the project.
On the whole, we consider this prospectus as one of the finest
“Curiosities of Literature” that have appeared for some time. We
recommend it to the particular notice of those interested in Old
Cleeve, West Porrock, and Parracombe. 'ºu'.

SHOULD THE POET BUNN HAVE A STATUE P
INCE it has been known that the Fine Arts
Commission have determined upon admitting
a few of the poets into the new Houses of
Parliament, the above interrogative has been
put to us by at least fifty correspondents. It
has also been met, in its own masterly way, by
the Observer. It is, of course, impossible for
us to print all the letters we have received ;
we therefore select a few, at the same time
extracting the remarks of our luminous and
logical contemporary.
(FRom “the observer.”)
“It has been asked, “Should the Poet BuNN have
a statue º' We really do not see why he should ;
yet, when we look again, we cannot altogether
perceive why he should not. It is true, he may
be called a usurper; having set aside KING MACREADY; but then, if
KING MACREADY would not remain on the throne of Drury, BUNN can
hardly be blamed for placing himself in the vacant seat. It is clear that
BUNN cannot be struck out of the history of Drury Lane; if, indeed, he
could, it would doubtless be as well; but as he cannot, why, perhaps it is
no worse. After all, however, it is clear that, one way or the other, the
difficulty must be decided. If, after all, BUNN has a statue, why, then,
the question will be answered in the affirmative, if otherwise, why then,
in parliamentary language, the ‘noes will have it.’”
“MR. Punch,
“I am an old actor. For two-and-forty years have I played the
‘heavy fathers.' . It has been my glory to serve at Drury Lane under
KINGs ELLISTON, PRICE, and Polhill. : I was, however, with SHAksPEARE
-that wonderful creature –cashiered by BUNN. He turned us both out
together. Although I have retired to the shores of Brighton—I and my
old umbrella—I have played Catesby nine hundred nights to the immortal
EDMUNDKEAN. I could play it still, sir: could personate that small, but
exceedingly difficult character, with all that fire and energy that in by-gone
nights drew from the galleries ‘Brayvo T ' (but I suppress my
name). Well, sir; and shall the man have a statue who has driven me
and a hundred other Catesbys to the obscurity of private life? Is it to
be borne, that the man who has so treated me and SHAksPEARE shall be
received in the Houses of Parliament, side by side, it may be, with that
very ShakspeaRE whose statue is now made to decorate a dancing-booth }
“But no l A patriotic QUEEN–a tasteful Prince—watches over the
true dignity of the drama; and BUNN–its Caoxiwell—shall not have a
statue !
“I am yours,
“TENDERT .”
“DEAR MR. Punch,
“My opinion has frequently been asked of the condition of Drury
Lane Theatre ; and, upon my life 1 when I come to consider the state of
things that—but you know as well as I do about all that. My opinion
has also been asked touching a statue to our old governor, BUNN. Well,
really, when you come to think of it, a statue does look like a sort of thing
that—upon my life it does. Nevertheless, as I am the only actor at
present engaged at Drury Lane, why, it would be exceedingly difficult in
me, difficult and delicate, you perfectly understand, and so,
“Believe me, dear MR. Punch,
“Yours, deeply, truly,
“John PRITT HARLEY.”
“SIR,
“For several seasons was I the manager of him you are pleased to
call the Poet BUNN. Like the outside pillars of Drury Lane, I considered
myself one of its supporters. Again and again I went round—as you
have it—with the hat for subscriptions for his many pieces of plate. Well,
sir, I was BuNN's manager: he has ruthlessly cashiered me ! And this
is the man to whom it is proposed to erect a statue !
“With scorn, Ha 1 ha : hal

who Doubts it f
THE great difficulty, in cases of collision, seems to be to stop a train
suddenly ; and, for this purpose, a brake, as it is called, sufficiently strong,
has not yet been invented. The chances are, however, that, before the
end of next session, the greater number of the present railways will have
found out the secret of some tremendous break, by which their further
progress will be stopped immediately.

THE OMNIBUS DRIVERS' HAND-BOOK TO LONDON.
E have heard that a little work with the
above title will shortly be published, to
obviate the difficulty in which the Om-
nibus Drivers are placed by the tearing
up of the pavements all over the metro-
polis. The way from Fleet Street to the
Strand, instead of being a straight line
as heretofore, almost requires the assist-
ance of a cicerone, and we believe that
guides are now stationed at the foot of Chancery Lane, like the ticket-
porters who stand at the entrance of the Desert, to show travellers
over it. As a general rule, it may be as well to bear in mind, that, instead
of going through Temple Bar straight into the Strand, you must take the
first to the right, the second to the left, the fifth to the left again, the third
to the right, the second to the left, then the sixth to the left, then straight
on, then sharp round, then short off, then the fourth to the right, and
finally to the left, when you will come out into the Strand in a direct
line with the place you started from. A few days ago, the distance from
Bond Street to the White Horse Cellar, instead of being ten yards, was
exactly a mile and three quarters, including the ups and downs of Ray
Hill, the ins and outs of Berkeley Square, and other distant localities.
We don't know at the present time any better illustration of “link'd
sweetness long drawn out" than a sixpenny ride in an omnibus.

GoD SAVE THE QUEEN :
It is sometimes a touching scene in our criminal courts, when the
awful judge—wigged and ermined, and with a tremendous weight of
wisdom on his brow-catechises a little child. “Do you know,” thus
asks that solemn man;–" do you know the punishment for those who
tell a lie?” Whereupon, if the well-educated infant confidently
chirps in answer, “they are in danger of hell-fire,”—the judge, with
a beneficent look, orders the child to be sworn. If, on the other
hand, the desolate little wretch is wholly ignorant of the appalling
penalty threatening an untruth, the judge looks very sad indeed at
the forlornness of humanity, and it may be, with a withering rebuke
of the parents of the infant, commands it to stand down. So wicked
is a lie—so sinful the enunciation of the thing that is not.
And yet, reader, having possessed yourself of the above placard,
you mustfeel that lying—stout, bold, brazen-cheeked lying—is deemed
an indispensable agent for the State. The scoundrel vice is invested
with the bright halo of authority. Indeed, looking at the above, and
duly considering its purpose, we can hardly believe that certain
authorities do not conceive a good bouncing lie to be among the
brightest jewels of the crown. What a pretty thing is what is often
called glory, when its purveyor, the recruiting-serjeant, must be an
incarnate falsehood.
“A few young men, of good character” . We see them, poor
victims 1 after even a month's drilling, filed on the deck. How cer-
tain they look of preferment 1 How the rattan, at intervals, coming
down upon their shoulders, legs, and knuckles, convinces them that
they are “sure of promotion” . How confident they feel, even when
without a farthing, that they will nevertheless “make their fortunes;”
they have, to be sure, empty pockets, but they will be “full of gold.”
And then, when they retire to their hammocks, what sweet, sustain-
ing visions of the night show to them their mature life, elevated and
enriched by “independence, honour, and wealth,” albeit the boat-
swain's whistle wakes them to the monotonous drudgery of military
discipline, with, it may happen, an occasional visitation of the “cat.”
And this tissue of falsehood is fringed with the patriotic prayer—
“God Save the Queen.” Sweet lady Surely she is sometimes to
be pitied for the atrocious untruths which, whether she will or not,
she is made to countenance. -
Qſìe $tatuts for tſje Ntſu £ousts of 33arliament.
The Commissioners on the Fine Arts have been groping about the new
Houses of Parliament to find places to put statues in. Unfortunately, the
niches are all too little to admit great men, and twenty-four inches is the
extreme width of a comfortable niche, so that the Commissioners have
been obliged togo through the “History of England” with a two-foot-rulein
order to find characters that can be brought within the prescribed limits.
The discontented Barons are all to be cut down, and even the Sovereigns
are obliged to submit to a general clipping. Considering the length to
which the Barons went with King John, we hardly see how it will be
possible to keep them sufficiently under, to admit of their getting into the
Gothic niches. The sameness of their attitude is said to fit them for these
narrow places; and it is true they were sturdy fellows, who, having once
taken up a position, were determined to stick to it. As to John of GAUNT,
he must give up his gauntness, if he expects any accommodation in the
new Houses. The VENERABLE BEDE is to have an inside place; and we
should propose Old PARR going down to posterity, with a box of “Life
Pills” in his hand, as a companion-statue.
CowPER is to have a statue: but we must beg that he will wear a decent
head-dress, and not make his appearance in that strange jack-towel-
looking turban in which we have usually seen him in portraiture.
PURCELL is the only musician on the list, but we understand he will have
a seal to his watch-chain engraved with a small portrait of Balfe, upon
whom PURCELL made a strong impression. There is a rumour that the
writers of Punch are to have statues opposite the Barons who signed
“Magna Charta,” as having used their pens for the good of their country
almost as much as the barons, who, with a few dashes of their goose.
quills, gave to posterity a boon that has only been equalled by a certain
popular periodical which modesty will not allow us to name, but which
the reader has at his fingers' ends at the present moment.
THE MONSTER NEWSPAPERS.
Eric er trade, we understand, is likely
to be ruined by the unhealthy glut of sup-
plements, which must eventually choke up
the very lungs of the market. Some of
the papers are becoming literally all supple-
ment, and the people railway-mad;—they in-
sert, their railway advertisements anywhere,
or in anything that calls itself a public
journal.
We anticipate very speedily a sort of sup-
plement crisis, or waste-paper panie ; for
when the holders of the supplements begin
to realise at the butter-shops, the adver-
tisers will see the folly of their outlay. As
it is, we never get a pound of butter that is
not encircled with the words “Provisionally
registered ;” and our six last batches of rush-
lights have come to us enveloped in forms of
application for some “Grand Junction Gam-
mon” or “Central Humbug and Direct Rob-
bery Line of Railway.”
We understand that the reason of the
general lateness of the trains throughout
the country, is the enormous weight of sup-
plements sent by the railways; and when it
is considered that these sometimes comprise
a very heavy leading article, the wonder is
that we do not hear of more frequent acci-
dents. The newsmen, instead of folding a
single paper, are now compelled to fold three;
and as their profit is only a penny, they
declare the proprietors shall come and fold
the papers themselves: while the carrying
them out requires a camel at least, instead
of a newsboy. A poor lad was found buried
under a heap of supplements a few days ago,
and he was with difficulty extricated from
his perilous situation among the dry rubbish
that surrounded him. The country news-
venders are declining the trade, finding that
it costs them more in carriage than they can
- get profit by selling the paper.
We know of no remedy for this supplement-mania. Not reading the
newspaper has been tried without success; for the more the public go on
not reading, the more the advertisers go on putting in and paying for
their advertisements. The waste-paper panic must come, and that very
speedily.

“Not kitched none Ah Sir, you should ha’ bin' here last Toosday: there was two Gents, killed a uncommon sight a' fish, to be sure, then.”
JOHN WESLEY AND PRINCE ALBERT.
As Bedlam Hospital and other such asylums have been very pro-
perly instituted for the dangerously insane and the helplessly idiotic,
so was the Morning Post established for the comfort of the many
harmless lunatics throughout the world, whose madness generally
vents itself in pen and ink. As Bedlam has its two images—
“CIBBER's brazen brothers,”—of raving and melancholy madness—
so would we have two figures, each with pen, ink, and paper, erected
at the office of the Morning Post. One figure should represent rabid
Toryism foaming at the mouth—the other, lackadaisical drivelling
nonsense, writing—eternally writing. Certainly, these figures ought
to externally represent to the out-of-door world types of what is to
be found in the paper: they would indicate—what is, nevertheless,
sufficiently well known—that “madness and folly are to be continu-
ally had within.”
The subject of the decoration of the Houses of Parliament offers
a magnificent theme for the lunatic correspondents of our contem-
porary. The question, “Should CRomwell have a statue " has sent
at least twenty wards of out-door lunatics to congenial goose-quills:
the columns of the Post have gabbled like Bedlam about the
usurper, “who was only another THISTLEwood.” Chomwell,
however, is not to engage all the moon-stricken. An unfortunate
person (we have no doubt that he wears straw boots), who signs
himself “An English Commoner,” is madly eloquent about John
WEs LEY, whose statue is to stand in Parliament. He raves after
the following fashion :-
“John Wesley was a priest of the Church of England, and as such, at his ordina-
tion, solemnly engaged to obey her laws, injunctions, &c. He ever professed to be so,
and thus effected much good ; but at the close of his long life, he, to the astonishment
of his relations and real friends, and in the teeth of his solemn vows and life-long en-
§. violated his oath, betrayed the Church he ever professed to belong to, and in
lefiance of every precedent ordained, or rather unceremoniously attempted to give ordina-
tion to many around him, which (by their acceptance) manifestly renders his present
followers guilty of the sin of schism against the English Church.”
Without inquiring into the truth of this, what—thinks the reader
-is to be the dreadful consequence of this admission of John
Weslex into Parliament Why, this; PRINce Albert will very
possibly commit bigamy. Because John WEsley is to have a
statue in the Commons, PRINCE ALBERT will forget his marriage-
vow, and incontinently marry a maid of honour, if not two or three.
“Now if you, after these occurrences, raise a statue to his [Wesley's] memory, you,
by implication, sanction his proceedings and approve his conduct: and on principle,
impartial history will thus deal with you. She will say, that when you sanction, this-
The Prince will thus tacitly sanction even the violation of his marriage vow, which is
not a whit more sacred or solemn than Wesley's ordination.”
Now, is not the existence of the Post a great comfort to all lunatics
at large, whose madness is pen and ink We really think there
ought to be a county rate levied to assist our contemporary, in the
like way that Hanwell, and other asylums, are supported by a
local tax.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. -
A BI, ACE BUSINESS.
HERE are some specs., among those that are now
started, which are not mere specks, but tremendous
blots; and we don't know of any much blacker
job, than one that has just appeared, for esta-
blishing a Great Western Necropolis. Its object
is to introduce what it calls, in large capital
letters—the only capital it is likely to command
—“THE Novel. BUT STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL Spec-
TacLE or BURIAL BY WATER.” Our, admiration
is particularly requested in the prospectus for
the Pyramids of Egypt; but our “Fat Contri-
butor” has rather spoiled our respect for those
things, and besides, we can see them on a small
scale any day in the streets, which are always
under repair, blocked up with enormous piles of
stone, as happens to be the ease just now all over the town, so that
any one may see the Strand pyramids, or the Piccadilly pyramids,
according to which way his business or curiosity may carry him.
The Great Western Necropolis is to consist of an extensive plot of
ground at a place marked emphatically in the prospectus. It
is proposed to have “a fine river frontage,” with “steam and small
gondola boats fitted up in funereal style,” with “houses of reception ºn
both sides of the river,” so that parties may be enabled to get up little
funeral pic-nics during the summer weather. As there are blanks left in
the prospectus for the Provisional Committee, the architect and the
banker, we should almost believe it is intended as a squib against the
solicitors, whose names are inserted at full length; and, under the impres-
sion that they have been subjected to a cruellibel, we have refrained from
printing them. -
If the impious and indelicate affair should be persevered in, we might
probably think it necessary to administer one of those remorseless smash-
ings which the baton of Punch seldom finds it necessary to inflict, but
which, when once inflicted, are always effectual.
THE LAMENT OF THE STATUES
(Representative of the Poets in the New Houses of Parliament.)
PREviously to the determination of the Royal Commissioners to erect
statues to the Poets in the new Houses of Parliament, they might as well
have consulted the feelings of those personages on the subject, which, we
suspect, would, with a slight difference of expression, be much like those
embodied in the following lines. These we have had the impudence to
put into the mouths of the poets, and to imagine each speech inscribed,
respectively, on the pedestals of their statues:–
Chaucer.
Good Sirs, I marvel what we here maken,
Grete folk, certès, be sometimes mistaken,
We standen in this stound by much errour,
Ne poet was in Parlement before ;
We are ſysh out of water, verily,
I do not breathè well this air, perdy.
In the Abbaye we weren well enoughe:
To put us here in Parlement is stuffe.
Spenser.
Troth, brother CHAuceR, I am of thy minde,
In Parlement I do not feel at home,
Where prating Dulness talks his hearer blinde,
And dry Debate doth vainly froth and foam,
Folly, not Fancy, from his theme doth roam,
And greedy Patriots rave for pence and place;
Poets are fashioned from another loam
Than heavy marle of Statesmen's crawling race,
And to be here, in faith, me seemeth dire disgrace.
Shakspeare.
Grave Grandsire CHAUcER, and good Father SPENSER,
The judgment your sweet worships have pronounced
On the hard mandate, and right stern decree,
Which, much misplacing us, hath placed us here,
Doth jump with my opinion. Here to 'bide
Beneath the pelting of the pitiless BRough AM,
To suffer Roebuck's petulance; tendure
The jokeless wit of SIBTHoRPE, and to brook
The specious eloquence of glozing PEEL
To any soul alive were Purgatory:–
But to a poet's 'tis a worser doom.
Oh that this monument were o'er my tomb
Milton.
My sentence is for walking off, oh Bards !
Though we be marble. Doth not story old
Record how statues, erst, have breathed and walked,
Instinct with life and motion? Why relate
| PYGMALion's idol, and the wife of clay,
| PANDoRA, she by cunning Vulcan wrought
For bold PRomETHEUs Or, in modern days,
The marble man that unto supper came
To Seville's famous, but immoral Don,
Hight GiovaNNI : Could I here remain,
Heavy debate to list with tortured ear,
My CRomwell's absence would determine mine.
| Haste then, and from your pedestals descend,
To stalk abroad with me through London's streets,
| Dark’ning with dire alarm the heart of Town.
I}ryden.
All British Art Commissions Royal sway,
And when they order, sculptors must obey.
This poets find, whose effigies, like ours,
Are called to Parliament by princely powers.
Hard is our fate, thus destined to remain
Where Noise and Nonsense hold divided reign,
Amid contending politician's strife, L
Who ne'er were represented in our life.
Oh! that I ne'er the tuneful lyre had strung !
Was it for this, unlucky bard, I sung
BLACKMORE and SHADWELL, after ages past,
Rejoice; your injured ghosts are now avenged at last.
Pope.
Curst, for ancestral sins, with parts and wit,
The Muse inspired me, and, alas ! I writ ;
Oh I had it been my happy fate to creep
With thee, good DENNIs, I with thee might sleep ;
But immortality no slumber knows,
And deathless bards can never taste repose,
Ev’n though Joe HUME invoke the drowsy God,
And SIBThorpe bid five hundred heads to nod ;
Though PLUMPTRE lull the House to rest profound,
And SpooneR scatter all his poppies round ;
And PALMERSTON compel the frequent wink,
Our ears in vain their opiate words will drink.
Oh! Brother Bards, whom Sculpture hither brings,
To mix with Statesmen, and to herd with Kings :
Blend, sole relief 1 your marble tears with mine :
Would that we ne'er had penn’d a single line !
THE COCKNEY EXPERIMENTAL SQUADRON.
A TRIAL of the Cockney Experimental Squadron came off a few days
ago in the Southwark Channel. The Bee and the Daisy were first pitted
against each other to steam it, under a heavy shower of rain, to the float-
|ing island of coal barges off Hungerford. Notwithstanding that the Bee
had an immeuse pressure of passengers, who had crowded all umbrellas
under a stiffish gale, which was blowing furiously the wrong way, she beat
| her antagonist by several cable's-lengths, ten knots and a quarter of a
fathom.
In the afternoon the Daisy challenged the Ant, and both crews appeared,
There was a twinkle in the eye of the

captain of the Daisy, which seemed to say, “No, you don't,” while there
was a quiet “Won't I though '' in the wink of the commander of the Ant,
which justified the confidence of his backers. After a great deal of puerile
| quarrelling between the two boys employed on board each vessel to watch
the signals of the captain, both crafts went away, with their heads well up
in the wind, when the Ant shot considerably in advance of her antagonist.
| The commander of the Daisy summoning his crew about him, addressed
them eloquently from the paddle-box, and was in the act of saying, “Are
ye men—are ye Britons—to let a rival steamer passye thus?” when Father

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
COMIC SCULPTURE.
Aving often laughed at the statues
and works of art which adorn the
metropolis in general, and in par-
ticular Trafalgar Square, nothing,
it is our conviction, can be more
manifest than the turn of our
sculptors for the ridiculous, which
they cannot help evincing, in spite
of themselves, even when aiming
most seriously at the Beautiful or
the Sublime. By the pig-tail of
GEORGE THE THIRD, this is a fact 1
Clearly, the tendency of the English
mind, in sculpture, is towards bur-
lesque. This cannot be repressed : let it therefore be directed. We possess
an abundance of living statesmen, and other great men, whom the artists
of their country could appropriately honour, and follow the bent of their
genius all the while. Let London be embellished in accordance with this.
In one conspicuous situation, for instance, we might have a statue of
LoRD BRough AM, in a pugilistic attitude—that is, hitting right and left, and
prostrating a friend with one fist, and a foe with the other. In another
might be erected one of SIR Robert PEEL, taking his seat between the
two stools of Orangeism and Repeal, and paying the penalty by the laws
of Physics in such case made and provided. In a third might be dis-
played Arithmetic, in the person of MR. HUME, instructing Mayoralty,
also duly embodied, in the art of keeping accounts. In a fourth might
be exhibited a Right Reverend BELISARIUs, with dog and crosier,
exemplifying the functions of an Ecclesiastical Commissioner.
S C R IP AN ID S OF T S O.A. P.
THE following advertisement is taken from the Cambridge Chronicle,
of October 11 :-
F M—, SH A R E B R O KER, C– S-, St. I—.
- MONEY ADVANCED TO ANY AMOUNT.
N.B.-PRIVATE ROOMS FOR HAIR CUTTING AND DRESSING at the
ensuing Fair.
What a pity St. I is so far off We should like, above all things, to
have our hair cut and curled by MR.M. ... We are extremely curious
to see how the grand amalgamation of the Rothschild and TRUEFITT lines
is carried on. We suppose MR. M. goes to the Stock Exchange, buys
up a good bear, returns to Crown Street, puts up an announcement of
“Another Fine Bear Slaughtered,” and sells the produce forthwith in
scrip and small allotments. We can imagine his recommending shares
with the same obstinacy a London hairdresser does his “Balms”
and “Essences,” and that he does not allow a customer to leave his shop
without having a “Trent Valley” under his arm, or else half-a-dozen
“Eastern Counties” thrust into his pocket. A barber's shop is not the only
place, however, in this railway age, where money is advanced to people
with the hope of shaving them afterwards.
COLONIES FOR SALE.
It seems that Denmark, being rather hard up, is getting rid of some of
its colonies, after the same fashion as Spain, which mortgaged Cuba for
the benefit of its creditors, who were thus enabled to take cigars for their
overdue dividends.
We understand that Denmark has several small colonial sovereignties
for sale, which it is intended to dispose of shortly, without any reserve
whatever, at the Auction Mart. The fee-simple of a kingdom, with a
reversionary interest in the taxes, after the expenses of Government are
paid, is no bad thing for a millionnaire stag who has made his plum or two
by railways, and requires some very out-of-the-way place to retire to
while the calls of the different lines in which he is a shareholder are
being clamoured for. A defaulter, who runs off with his pockets full of
other people's money, had better purchase a regular right-down sove-
reignty, where he can have the law all his own way, and abolish at once,
within his own dominions, all liability for debts contracted in another
country.
For the convenience of those who undertake a runaway voyage from
their own liabilities, with a fortune made by stagging, we should
recommend that those colonial kingdoms which are for sale should have
their thrones brought down to the sea-shore, with a broom hanging from
the canopy, to indicate the fact of their being in the market to such
persons as may be travelling past in a foreign vessel.
A placard announcing “This beautiful kingdom to be sold or let, with
or without a ministry,” would be an attractive object on the coasts of
those outlandish seas, where the imagination and the swindler love to
travel to.
THE CROMWELL STATUE QUESTION.
WE are happy to have it in our power to settle the difference that
has long existed as to the propriety of letting CRomwell have a Statue
in the new Houses of Parliament. By dressing him up in the costume
of the middle ages, nobody will know him; and if nobody knows him,
it matters to nobody whether he is to be found or not among the
collection of senatorial sculpture. Disguised under the mediaeval
costume and the very médiocre drawing of the middle age, no one
will know that it is the statue of CRomwell which stands before
them—so that the scruples of the “right divine” party will not be
outraged, while History will be preserved inviolate.

Barry's Portraits.
MR. BARRY's portraits of the statesmen of England are still being
issued in weekly numbers. They are beautifully gilt, and are got up in a
most elegant style. When completed, there will be a portrait for nearly
every member of the House of Commons. About one hundred are
already out, as will be seen upon counting the number of weathercocks
that adorn the new Palaces of Westminster. When finished, they will
make as handsome a series of political portraits as a nation could desire ;
for each weathercock, on turning, illustrates a principal event in the
original's life, shifting invariably from side to side, and trimming exactly
as the wind blows.

MEDITATIONS OVER BRIGHTON.
BY “PUNCH's " commissioxER.
(From the Devil's Dyke.)
WHEN the exultant and long-eared animal described in the fable
revelled madly in the frog-pond, dashing about his tail and hoof
among the unfortunate inhabitants of that piece of water, it is stated
that the frogs remonstrated, exclaiming, “Why, O donkey, do you
come kicking about in our habitation ? It may be good fun to you to
lash out, and plunge, and kick in this absurd manner, but it is death
to us:” on which the good-natured quadruped agreed to discontinue
his gambols; and left the frogs to bury their dead and rest henceforth
undisturbed in their pool.
The inhabitants of Brighton are the frogs—and I dare say they
will agree as to the applicability of the rest of the simile. It might
good fun to me to “mark their manners, and their ways survey ;”
but could it be altogether agreeable to them : I am sorry to confess
it has not proved so, having received at least three hundred letters
of pathetic remonstrance, furious complaint, angry swagger, and
threatening omens, entreating me to leave the Brightonians alone.
The lodging-house keepers are up in arms. Mns. Schew says she
never let her lodgings at a guinea a day, and invites me to occupy
her drawing and bed-room for five guineas a week. M.R. SquEEzen
swears that a guinea a day is an atrocious calumny: he would turn
his wife, his children, and his bed-ridden mother-in-law out of doors
if he could get such a sum for the rooms they occupy-(but this, I
suspect, is a pretext of SquEEzeb's to get rid of his mother-in-law,
in which project I wish him luck). Mas. Slop hopes she may never
again cut a slice out of a lodger's joint (the cannibal!) if she won't be
ready at the most crowdidest of seasons to let her first-floor for six
pounds; and, finally, MR. Skiven writes:–"Sir, –Your ill-advised
publication has passed like a whirlwind over the lodging-houses of
Brighton. You have rendered our families desolate, and prematurely
closed our season. As you have destroyed the lodging-houses, couldn’t
you, now, walk into the boarding-houses, and say a kind word to ruin
the hotels tº
And is it so? Is the power of the Commissioner's eye so fatal that
it withers the object on which it falls? Is the condition of his life
so dreadful that he destroys all whom he comes near Have I made
a post-boy wretched—five thousand lodging-house-keepers furious-
twenty thousand Jews unhappy? If so, and I really possess a power
so terrible, I had best come out in the tragic line.
I went, pursuant to orders, to the Swiss Cottage, at Shoreham,
where the first object that struck my eye was the following scene,
=sº

in the green lake there, which I am credibly informed is made of
pea-soup : two honest girls were rowing about their friend on this
enchanting water. There was a cloudless sky overhead—rich treats
were advertised for the six frequenters of the gardens; a variety of
entertainments was announced in the Hall of Amusement.—MR.
and Mas. AMINADAR (here, too, the Hebrews have penetrated) were
*: a. abºut to sing some of their most favourite comic songs
an
But no, I will not describe the place. What should my fatal glance
bring a curse upon it ! The pea-soup lake would dry up—leaving its
bed a vacant tureen—the leaves would drop from the scorched trees—
the pretty flowers would wither and fade—the rockets would not rise
at night, nor the rebel wheels go round—the money-taker at the door
would grow mouldy and die in his moss-grown and deserted cell.—-
AMINADAB would lose his engagement. Why should these things
be, and this ruin occur : James pack the portmanteau and tell the
landlord to bring the bill ; order horses immediately—this day I will
quit Brighton.
Other appalling facts have come to notice : all showing more or
less the excitement created by my publication.
The officers of the 150th Hussars, accused of looking handsome,
solemn, and stupid, have had a meeting in the mess-room, where
the two final epithets have been rescinded in a string of resolutions.
But it is the poor yellow-breeched postilion who has most suffered.
When the picture of him came out, crowds flocked to see him. He
was mobbed all the way down the Cliff; wherever he drove his little
phaëton, people laughed, and pointed with the finger and said, “That
is he.” The poor child was thus made the subject of public laugh-
ter by my interference—and what has been the consequence In
order to disguise him as much as possible, his Master has bought him
a hat.
The children of Israel are in a fury too. They do not like to ride in
flys, since my masterly representation of them a fortnight since.
They are giving up their houses daily. You read in the Brighton
papers, among the departures, “ NEBUzARADAN, Esq., and
family for London;” or, “SolomoN RAMoTHGILEAD, Esq., has quitted
his mansion in Marine crescent ; circumstances having induced him
to shorten his stay among us;” and so on. The people emigrate by
hundreds; they can't bear to be made the object of remark in the
public walks and drives—and they are flying from a city of which
they might have made a new Jerusalem.
FASHIONS FOR THE FLEET.
We understand that our ships being intended for ornament rather than
for use, will in future be furnished by TAPRELL and Holland, the cele-
brated upholsterers. The Bulldog frigate is to have a set of mahogany
masts, and the main-sheet is to go to Howell and JAMEs's, to be spliced
with mother-o'-pearl, as well as to have a small row of insertion put in
between the gusset of the main-top, which will have a very pretty effect if
a frill is added to the sky-scraper. It is in contemplation to inlay the
binnacle with buhl, and replace the old bowsprit with satin-wood. The
sails are to be worked in floss silk with the arms of England, and real
beads are to be let in for the eyes of the lion and unicorn. The Admiral's
daughter has kindly undertaken to work a lace ruff to go round the
compass; and as the material will wash, the weather, of course, can have
no effect upon it.
The Penny Boats.
At a meeting of the proprietors of the penny steam-boats, a most satis-
factory report was read by the Secretary. Each voyage consumes only a
quarter of a hundred of coals, at one-and-fourpence, which, allowing
twopence for wood and lucifer matches, enables, each vessel to navigate
the entire distance, from the West-End to the City, for one-and-sixpence.
It is calculated that each passage averages a return of three-and-
elevenpence, which, allowing a penny for the Captain and a halfpenny
each for the crew for every voyage, gives a clear profit of two-and-
twopence for the shareholders. Now that the City omnibusses are com-
pelled to traverse the distant wilds of Rolls' Buildings, and the romantic
fastnesses—where the vehicles are always sticking fast-of Carey Street,
the penny squadron is a real blessing to Londoners.
APPROACHING DISSOLUTION.
The Piers of Westminster Bridge had a meeting yesterday. It was
unanimously resolved, that they would no longer support, the building, of
which they had been the pillars for so many years, and that unless some
provision was instantly made for them in their old age, they would all
retire in a body, and seek a maintenance elsewhere. One venerable old
pier, who was apparently in the last stage of decay, announced his inten-
tion of going down the river in a few days, and sailing for America. The
piers broke up after giving three groans for the Lord Mayor and Con-
servators of the river.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ANTI-RAILWAY MEETING OF FOX-HUNTERS.
ON Sunday last—this being the day usually selected for sporting conver-
saziones—a meeting of country gentlemen took place at a certain box
in a well-known hunting district. The box not containing a compartment
large enough to hold them, the assembly adjourned to the extensive
stables attached to it.
MARtin Gale, Esquire, a gentleman of great name and influence in
the county, was unanimously called to the corn-bin, which answered every
purpose of a chair.
The respected Chairman commenced by stating the object for which
the meeting had been convened; namely, to take into consideration the
prospects of fox-hunting, as likely to be affected by the lines of railway
about to intersect the kingdom. He would call their serious attention to
a most gloomy picture. This was the frontispiece of the last number of
the “Railway Guide.” It was a map of England and Wales, showing
both the existing and projected lines. Could they conceive a more
melancholy prospect than this He would now exhibit to them a similar
map in a recent number of Punch. He had no objection to harmless
mirth ; but he thought that Punch might better employ his pen or pencil,
or whatever it was, than in joking on so serious a subject. With the
country thus furrowed and channelled all over, he would ask where they
were to run ? Echo answered “Where : " But Echo would never more
respond to “Tally-ho?” The hills and vales of Old England would cease
to resound with “Yoicks 1” “Tantivy l’” would be a forgotten word;
and the only view-hollow, for the future, would be that of some con-
founded tunnel. He would ask the meeting what they were to do? He
did not know, for his part; and, having confirmed this assertion with an
oath, he sat down amid much applause.
SIR NIMRod SNAFFLEs had never thought to speak against rails. They
all knew his bay mare, and were aware that few would stop her. But
these rails would bring all hunting to a stand-still ; Parliament should
have thought of that.' Suppose the fox took the rail, as it would from
natural instinct, how could they follow the scent with the train following
them : The animal would run to tunnel, of course ;-there would be a
pretty smash 1. The fox would be in at their death, instead of their being
in at his. Other interests were protected; why not those of the fox-
hunter Talk of the laborious classes'
men who worked as hard as any in the kingdom. His vested rights,
therefore, ought to be respected; and for this purpose he would move
that a petition be presented to Parliament praying for the stoppage of
further railway extension.
The Honourable MR. WHYTE CoRDURoys would second that motion.
Never might he see that ugly invention, the steam-engine, supersede that
sion went on. It would be impossible, however, to hunt by steam. The
| chase would therefore be abolished; the southerly wind and the cloudy
He belonged to a body of
noble animal, the horse!. But this would be the case if railway exten- rºgºśº
sky would no longer proclaim a hunting morning ; the hunt, in fact,
would be up for ever. Let them, therefore, take time by the forelock,
and make the most of it whilst they could. He was addressing fox-
hunters; but he knew that they could enjoy stag-hunting on occasion;
and he would conclude by advising them to commence instantly hunting
the railway Stag, and use their best endeavours to run him down.
The petition was then agreed upon ; and after three several volleys of
groans for engineers, stokers, steam, and HER MAJESTY's MINISTERs, the
meeting went to inspect the kennel.
CLERGYMEN ON RAILWAYS.
WHEN we saw the names of various clergymen in the list of Directors
of proposed railways, we felt that the reverend gentlemen could not be
better placed. As railways are for the most part conducted, we think
every Company should have at least ten clergymen in its direction, one
holy gentleman being compelled to travel with every train, that he might
be on the spot to administer consolation in the case of mortal casualty.
Indeed, every train should have its parson, as every line-of-battle ship
has its chaplain. HENRY of Exeter, however, has written a sort of
pastoral note to a director clergyman, calling his attention to the 1st and
2nd Vic., which do not permit members of the Church to “deal for gain
or profit.” Taking the hint from the Bishop, may we also be allowed to
point out these statutes to certain Deans and Chapers who show their
churches for gain and profit, and, turning the penny by the exhibition of
statues, &c., do certainly compete with MADAME Tussaud, and such like
traders ?
Royal Melodies.
The King of DENMARK is selling one of his colonies, a newspaper para-
graph says, “for a mere song.” We have made inquiries in the City, and
have ascertained that the song alluded to is “I’ve no money.”
COMING EVENTS, &c. , -
As many as seventeen thousand newspapers have been found in the
General Post Office with their covers burst. The reason of the news-
papers bursting is accounted for, by the fact that they contain so many
railway bubbles.

THE KNIGHT OF THE MAGIC LOOM.
KNIGHT there liv'd, in Albion's later
days,
A fair, sleek knight—hight “of
the Magic Loom ;”
A wealthy wight was he, of mickle
praise,
And fruits of earthright valiant
to consume,
(I ween he seldom thought of
Dives' doom)
And eke magician of no small
renown ;
For a dark sprite, inhabitant of
º
-
gloom,
Work'd all his hests, while he on
beds of down
Was lord of countless slaves,
close pent in smoky town.
palace fair,
Where he his doughty deeds of
knighthood wrought :
KING ARTHUR, sure, and LANCELOT
would stare,
To see the warfare modern
knights are taught ;
For there, full oft, with glitter-
ing blade he fought
'Gainst wild-boar, fowl, and beeves
of stalwart might:
His lady gay, to see such deeds,
distraught,
“Ah! court not death !” would
cry; “desist, sweet knight!
This, gorging makes you snore
so horribly at night.”
One night, with such fell tourney
quite foredone,
Back in his chair of down the
hero fell ;
He in the morn through his do-
mains had run,
And mark'd how all his vassals
labour'd well,
And how, obedient to the potent
spell,
Toil'd his dark slave, “Sprite of
the Power of Steam,”
With all the dread machinery of Hell—
Red hissing flame, swift wheel, and creaking beam :-
And now, the battle o'er, the knight began to dream.
First, like true knight, he fought his wars again,
Fair danc'd his vanquish’d foes before his eyne;
But oft he seem'd to writhe with twinging pain,
Of recent scathe from them receiv'd a sign ;
Their names were “Turtle,” “Turbot,” “Wen’son,” “Wine,”
“Grouse,” “Custard,” “Stilton,” “Macaroni,” “Ale;”
For he in one fell stoure slew giants nine :
Ne marvel if he sickly look'd and pale :
His wife in cambric handkerchief for fear 'gan wail.
Then to his morning walk his thoughts recurr'd,
And, “O sweet steam,” he mutter'd with a smile ;
When lo! a wondrous monster at the word,
Rose from the earth, array'd in fiendish style;
Like unsubstantial mist he seem'd awhile,
A giant soon, of strength the world to tame,
Up shot his grinning head for many a mile,
Danc'd in a thousand shapes, and went and came,
And º and hiss'd, and howl'd 5–his breath was smoke and
anne,
“Knight of the Magic Loom, you call'd,” he cried.
Loud n'd the knight, half choking in his dream,
And “Who art thou, dark stranger ?” He replied:–
“Your most obedient slave, the Sprite of Steam,
Unconquer'd offspring of the Fire and Stream;
And I for thee throughout the world will go,
And fetch thee riches; swift as solar beam,
Convulse the town, and deal the murderous blow,
And hiss, and shriek, and howl, and laugh at human woe 1"
Hard by this town he built *
“Welcome, good slave l’’ the shudd'ring knight replied,
“But oh your dreadful language gives me pain;
You will alarm the lady at my side.”
“She cannot hear !” wild laugh'd the fiend again,
“But see the victims of my jolly reign.”
Then like a lightning flash away he flew,
And back return'd with such a woful train,
Borne by the hair along, that at the view
Loud sobb’d and wheez'd the knight !—his visage crimson grew.
There cripples groan, the sick deserted die,
And hungry wretches shiver pale and bare,
There the wild drunkard stares with fiery eye–
Some seem for riot ripe, and some despair;
And thousands laugh with lewd and reckless air,
Ignorant and lust-besotted. Sadly moans
The knight in troublous trance; up starts his hair;
In broken words remorsefully he groans—
As, “education”—“poor”—“relief”—and “health of towns.”
“Hal” yell'd the Spirit, “craven master mine,
What joke is this my lord seems quite unmann'd ;
The poor haſ haſ come, dry thy tender eyne,
And I will still run riot in the land ;
For, see 1 these bags of gold so bright and grand.”—
Loud shrieks the knight, up starting in dismay,
“Back, slavel I hate thee, with thy coal-black hand.”
“Black hand I Good Heavens !” he hears a soft voice say,
“My dear, how odd you talk 1 these gloves are clean to-day :
“Butoh I really thought you would have died,
And every moment fear'd to see you fall,
You look’d so wild and red, and gasp'd and sigh'd;—
But come, my love, I'm ready for the ball.”
“Alack l’” he cried, “it would a saint appal
To dream my dream ; I’ve duties to perform—
Now learnt, ne'er known before.”—“Lord how you drawl
But take a cup of tea while it is warm,
And do arrange your hair in some more decent form.”

PUNCH*S PROSPECTUS
of His own INIMITABLE LINEs, BRANCHING OUT IN AN INFINITE series,
without THE smallest PROSPECT OF A TERMINUs;
(Provisionally Registered at Stationers' Hall)
witH INExhAUSTIBLE REsources, which ARE UNIVERSALLY PRONOUNCED
To BE CAPITAL IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD.
This magnificent project is divided weekly into 5,000,000 shares, with a
deposit of threepence on the office counter, in exchange for which, scrip is
immediately given. There is a call of threepence every week, and
persons wishing to have their stock consolidated into a volume, may have
the transfer made every half-year by leaving their scrip at the office, such
a contract being binding.
Of the Direction it is needless to say anything, for every one allows
that Punch's direction is the right one. The engineering difficulties con-
sist of the very onerous task of supplying to the whole public the benefit
of first-rate lines and communications; but these difficulties have been
overcome, for Punch can point with pride to his astonishing cuttings and
his wonderful levellings, which, in taking a direct and straightforward
course, he has been compelled to resort to.
This great national project has long since obtained the entire support
of the whole of the public, a result which has been secured by the Direc-
tors taking care that their lines shall go right home to every station. . The
peculiarity of Punch's lines consists partly in their not admitting of any
sleepers; and it is a remarkable fact that such has been their power of
tunnelling that the Directors have been enabled to get through every-
thing, or, in the technical language of raillery, to walk into it.
Applications for shares, in the usual form, may be made at the Office,
92, Fleet Street, and to any respectable periodical-brokers. Persons not
known to the Directors must give a reference to some respectable Banker,
or refer to their own pockets for the necessary deposit.
NEW WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.
The monster newspapers are now used in many shops instead of the
usual weights. Four supplements, we believe, go to a hundredweight. The
leaders, however, are never used, as they are found to be so much
| heavier some days than others.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
º, EADLE. An old constitutional officer, of Saxon
B' origin, whose duty it was to keep off the boys
# at the Druidical ceremonies, and clear the
road for the members of the Wittenagemote,
as they went down to the House during the
Session. Load Coke speaks of the beadle
of a forest, and there are still beadles of
the woods and forests, including the two
functionaries of the Quadrant, who some-
times so far forget their official dignity as
to be seen drinking tea out of large mugs
behind one of the pillars of the portico.
Parochial beadles are superior to the lay
beadles, “and yet,” says SPELMAN, “they
be lay beadles too, for with their canes they do lay into the boys
who happen to be refractory.” In the English Universities there
are gentlemen beadles, who, to make themselves select, call them-
selves bedels, but as “the rose by any other name,” &c. &c., so the
beadle by any other mode of spelling is still only a beadle.
BED of Justice (lit de Justice). The seat, or throne, on which the
KING or FRANCE used to sit when personally present in Parliament.
As the debates were enough to send His MAJESTY to sleep, it was
right that he should be provided with a bed when listening to the
speeches. Louis THE SixTEENTH was the last French sovereign
who assembled a bed of justice, which led to the Revolution ; so that
the saying, “as you make your bed so you must lie,” was very perti-
nent to the case of that unfortunate monarch.
BEDcHAMBER, LoRDs of THE, are officers of the Royal House-
hold, whose duties consist in bringing the King his bootjack and
slippers, or helping him on with his dressing-gown. In the reign of
WILLIAM THE Fount H there were twelve, who waited a week each
in turn, stropping the Royal razors, putting hot water at the door of
the Royal dressing-room, and seeing that His MAJESTY was always
provided with a clean pair of Clarences—the high-lows, so called out
of compliment to the Sailor-King, who always wore them. In the
reign of a Queen, ladies fill the offices alluded to, their duties con-
sisting of filling the Royal scent-bottles, looking to the supply of
bear's grease, and taking care that HER MAJESTY is never out of
any of the essential articles of the toilette. In May, 1839, SIR. R.
PEEL having been called in to form a ministry, and knowing the
influence of a little female chat in the confidential intercourse of the
dressing-room, stipulated for the removal of the ladies; but the
QUEEN, imagining that it could not matter to the nation whether
the liberal Lady A, or the conservative Lady B, attended in the state
chambre-à-coucher, declined yielding to the demand of SIR. R., who
was compelled to relinquish the grasp he had already laid on the
office he had so long been waiting for.
Beggan. A person who is brought by poverty to a dead stand-
still, but who is being continually told by the police that he must
move on. It has been erroneously said that beggars must not be
choosers, but this is not true ; for they can generally take their
choice between theft and a sufficient provision in gaol, or starvation
in one of the Union Workhouses.
BENEFIcE. A provision for ecclesiastical persons, from bene facere,
to do well ; because, according to some, the ecclesiastics are well-
doers; or, according to others, the persons are well done who have to
pay the benefice. Lord Coke says, “Beneficium is a large word,”
and everybody else says it ought to be a large word, considering the
large sum that is sometimes included in it.
BENEFIT of CLER GY. An exemption from punishment of any
person who could prove himself to be a clerk; so that the produc-
tion of a barrister's wig-box would be primá facie proof that the
bearer of it was a clerk, and if he were condemned to be hanged he
would have obtained a pardon. Reading was, however, the most
general proof of clerkship; and if a culprit had been unable to read
at his trial, but had taken six lessons after conviction, and could read
even on the scaffold, he would have been saved from the hands of the
hangman. The “Benefit of Clergy” has been abolished by statute, and
even the chimney-sweepers' May-day festivity, which was in some
sort a “benefit of clergy,” has, by the devastating hand of the Ramo-
neur, been fearfully demolished.
BENEvoleNCE. A royal mode that formerly prevailed of obtain-
ing supplies by an odd mixture of mendicity and robbery, a curious
combination of the meanness of the beggar with the violence of
the highwayman. It was as if the KING should go round with the
crown converted into a hat, asking alms, and holding the sceptre in a
threatening position, as much as to say, “Your money or your life ſ”
to those of his subjects from whom the benevolence was to be ex-
tracted. This institution, like many other projects with benevolence
for their ostensible object, was a decided swindle, which prevailed
till 1688, when the Bill, which, from its putting everything to rights,
was called the “Bill of Rights,” put an end to the imposition.
BILL IN CHANceRY. This is such an endless business, that we
decline going into it. Those who know what a Bill in Chancery is,
must be aware that it beggars description as much as it beggars
everybody and everything. Those who know nothing of a Bill in
Chancery may rest satisfied with the assurance that “where ignor-
ance is bliss 'tis folly to be wise.”

THE RAILWAY WORKHOUSE.
WHEN we consider the daily supplements of the newspapers, filled with
railway prospectuses; when we reflect that three-fourths of those schemes
are arrant bubbles; when we recollect that as large a proportion of the
shareholders therein are men of straw ; and, finally, when we compute
the sum that, what with advertisements, estimates, surveys, and
other disbursements, these are likely to amount to ; a painful idea
obtrudes itself on our apprehension that, not to speak with too literal
a strength, a very large herd of stags will go to the dogs. Under these
circumstances, we see no other asylum for them than the workhouse ; and,
as such a terminus will be terrible to all who have ever known the merest
comfort, we earnestly suggest the establishment, by charitable subscription,
of a Joint Stock Railway Workhouse, where at least the common neces-
saries of life may be secured to the inmates. The wind will thus, in a
measure, be tempered to the shorn stag, and a refuge will be provided for
him, where, when at length compelled to draw his horns in, he may end
his days in peace.

“As I was going down Stagg Alley, yesterday, to sign the Great Didland deed, I saw
the prettiest little Brougham in the world pull up at Horn Street—and the sweetest little love
of a figure you ever saw, step out of the vehicle. Her appearance created quite a sensation
among the stagging gents, and caused even me to pause and look round. - -
“Greatly to my surprise, this lovely young lady tripped by me, walked into the Didland
Office, where up comes all the clerks crowding and grinning about her, and signed the deed
with the greatest coolness in the world; I peeped over her shoulder, and saw her write—

thrilling accents, “I deliver this as my act and deed!” - -
“I have not given her real name here, but if she took notice of a gent. in a green coat and
little blue satin stock, light auburn hair and whiskers, diamond pin and brown silk umbrella,

PRIZES FOR PINCHING.
Agricultural Associations, in awarding prizes
to deserving labourers, are no doubt actuated by a
* Praiseworthy benevolence; but we confess
that, to us, they appear to display a certain want of
system.
It is no doubt very proper to reward the labourer
for general good conduct; that is to say, for pinching
back and stomach to the greatest possible degree,
and toiling from morning to night, all the year
round, to the utmost limits of human endurance.
But, few, however, are capable of such very good
conduct as this, and we really think a more partial
merit worthy of some recompense. A prize might
be awarded to the ploughman or cartºr who has
fasted the greatest number of days for a term of
years; who has eaten the least bacon, and drunk
the smallest quantity of beer, or kept himself ani
family on the coarsest kind of food for a given
period. For instance, a small sum might be allotted
to the man who had lived the longest time on the
smallest number of bones, made into soup. Pre-
miums might likewise be given for going without
hats or stockings, or dispensing with the Iuxury of
linen; also for sleeping on the bare floor, or being
content with straw instead of a bed.
Many of our labouring population are capable of
particular acts of self-denial, though unable to shave
in every particular with that closeness which Agri-
cultural Societies would prescribe. Every penny
that can be saved from poor's rates, or from wages,
is ultimately an addition to landlords rents, and of
an impºrtance commensurate with the general small-
* of those pittances. Surely, therefore, that
labourer who, though he may not deprive himself
of every comfort, renounces as many as he can for
the benefit of the poor landlord, is a person who
deserves to be encouraged. Let the smallest sacri.
fices of the peasadt be thankfully received.
THE EXPERIMENTAL SQUADRON.
WE regret to hear that the ships constituting
the Experimental Squadron have been in a very
bad way since the late severe trial to which they
have been subjected.
The Albion has been suffering from an internal
complaint, consisting of a derangement of the ballast,
which rendered drastic treatment necessary; and
no less than thirty tons were taken from her. At
one time, her state was so frightfully plethoric, that
she was thought to be gradually sinking; but she
has since rallied under the influence of strong sti-
mulants. The Queen has been suffering from a
pressure of the stays, and a straining of the arms,
but is now considerably better. The Vanguard
has been rather dropsical, and has had water on
the chest, but is now as well as can be expected.
The Canopus was thought to have had two of her
ribs broken, accompanied by a coldness in the legs
or shivering of the timbers; but on inspection she
proved to be in a tolerably sound condition.

ment of the aforesaid gentleman, whom we can now fancy seated on
the same ground with vulgar, penniless misdemeanor, manipulating
his oakum, hardly yet reconciled to the fact that the force of money
has, for once, failed him. We understand that Sir JAMEs GRAHAM
intends to institute an evening-school for magistrates, that they
may be the better instructed. MR. HARDwick will be appointed
schoolmaster. It is to be hoped that Twyford, GREEN wood, and
º old boys we could name, will attend regularly, and profit by
the lessons of their master.
RAILWAY STATISTICS.
THERE is one department in which the Railway papers are sadly defi-
cient, namely, the announcement of Railway Births, Deaths, and
Marriages. The daily springing up of the new projects, with their con-
stant cutting off in the dangerous stage of infancy—a cutting off in which
the directors may some day participate—and the frequent union of one
railway with another—would afford ample materials for the department of
births, deaths, and marriages, in a railway newspaper. It would be
“I say Bill, 'ave you seen Wotdyecallum ?”
“Wot, do you mean Wots'isname * *
“0 no, not 'im, that 'ere tother.”
“0, ah : I seed 'im fast enuff.”
Eºastic PAveMENT.-We perceive that a Company has been advertised
{º.1aying down elastic pavement. Elasticity of course means the capa-
bility of being pulled out; but the pulling out will, we suspect, devolve
entirely on the º
curious to see how many had been safely delivered of a new scheme,
whether the parent was “doing well,” which might be very possible, and
whether the offspring was tolerably healthy, with a large development
of the faculties for coming soon to a state of wholesome premium. The
deaths, with their various causes, consisting of inanition, rapid consump-
tion, or original weakness of the constitution, would also be an interesting
feature; while unions actually formed, as well as marriages on the tapis,
between the various lines desirous of amalgamating their interests and
becoming one, would be of the greatest utility, as well as afford consi-
derable amusement. We may probably supply from time to time a list
of railway births, deaths, and marriages.

JEAMES ON TIME BARGINGS.
ERAPs at this present momink of
Railway Hagetation and unsafety
the follying little istory of a young
friend of mine may hact as an
olesome warning to hother week
and hirresolute young gents.
“Young FREDERick TIMMINs
was the horphanson of a respect-
able cludgyman in the West of
Hengland. Hadopted by his uncle,
Colonel T , of the Hoss-
Mareens, and regardless of ex-
pence, this young man was sent
to Heaton Collidge, and subsi-
* quintly to Hoxford, where he was
very nearly being Senior Rangler.
He came to London to study for
the lor. His prospix was bright
indead ; and He lived in a secknd
flore in Jerming Street, having
gin teal inkum of two hunderd lbs per hannum.
“With this andsum enuity it may be supposed that FREDERick wanted
for nothink. Nor did he. He was a moral and well-educated young
man, who took care of his close; pollisht his hone tea-party boots ;
cleaned his kidd-gloves with injer rubber; and, when not invited to dine
out, took his meals reglar at the Hoxford and Cambridge Club—where
(unless somebody treated him) he was never known to igseed his alf-pint
of Marsally Wine.
“Merrits and vuttues such as his coodnt long pass unperseawd in the
world. Admitted to the most fashnabble parties, it wasn't long befor
sevral of the young ladies viewed him with a favorable i ; one, ixpecially,
the lovely Miss HEMILY MULLIGATAwney, daughter of the Heast-Injar
Derector of that name. As she was the richest gal of all the season, of
corse FREDERick fell in love with her. His haspirations were on the
pint of being crowndid with success; and it was agreed that as soon as he
was called to the bar, when he would sutnly be apinted a Judge, or a
revising barrister, or Lord Chanslor he should lead her to the halter.
“What life could be more desirable than FREDERIck's 1. He gave
up his mornings to perfeshnl studdy, under M.R. BLUEBAG, the
heminent pleader; he devoted his hevenings to helegant sosiaty at his
Clubb, or with his hadord HEMILY. He had no cares; no detts; no
egstravigancies; he never was known to ride in a cabb, unless one of his
tip-top friends lent it him ; to go to a theayter unless he got a horder ;
or to henter a tavern or smoke a cigar. If prosperraty was hever chocked
out, it was for that young man.
“But suckmstances arose. Fatle suckmstances for pore FREDERICK
TIMMINs. The Railway Hoperations began.
“For some time, immerst in lor and love, in the hardent hoccupations of
his cheembers, or the sweet sosiaty of his HEMILY, FREDERick took no
note of railroads. He did not reckonize the jigantic revalution which,
with hiron strides was a walkin over the country. But they began to be
talked of even in his quiat haunts. Heven in the Hoxford and Cambridge
Clubb, fellers were a speckulatin. ToM TRUMPER (of Brasen Nose) cleared
four thowsnd lb. ; Bob Bullock (of Hexeter), who had lost all his
proppaty gambling, had set himself up again; and Jack Deuce.ACE, who
had won it, had won a small istate besides by lucky specklations in the
Share Markit.
“Hevery body won. “Why shoudn't I,’ thought pore FRED. ; and
having saved 100 lb., he began a writin for shares—using, like an ickono-
minicle feller as he was, the Club paper to a prodigious igstent. All the
Railroad directors, his friends, helped him to shares—the allottments
came tumbling in—he took the primmiums by fifties and hundreds a day.
His desk was cramd full of bank notes: his brane world with igsitement.
“He gave up going to the Temple, and might now be seen hall day
about Capel Court. He took no mor hinterest in lor; but his whole talk
was of railroad lines. His desk at MR. BlueBAG's was filled full of pro-
spectisises, and that legal gent wrote to FRED's uncle, to say he feared he
was neglectin his bismiss.
“Alass 1 he was neglectin it, and all his sober and industerous habits.
He begann to give dinners, and thought nothin of partys to Greenwich
or Richmond. He didn't see his HEMILY near so often : although the
hawdacious and misguided young man might have done so much more
heasily now than before : for now he kep a Broom
... “But there's a tumminus to hevery Railway. FRED.'s was approachin;
in an evil hour he began making time-bargains. Let this be a warning to
all young fellers, and FRED.'s huntimely hend hoperate on them in a moral
pint of vul
.“You all know under what favrabble suckemstansies the Great Hafrican
Line, the Grand Niger Junction, or Gold Coast and Timbuctoo (Pro-
vishnal) Hatmospheric Railway came out four weeks ago: deposit nine
pence per share of 20l. (six elephant's teeth, twelve tons of palm-oil, or
four healthy niggers, African currency)—the shares of this helegeble in-
vestment rose to 1, 2, 3, in the Markit. A happy man was FRED. when,
after paying down 100 ninepences (31.15s.), he sold his shares for 250l.
He gave a dinner at the Star and Garter that very day. I promise you
there was no Marsally there. |
“Nex day they were up at 3}. This put FRED. in a rage : they rose
to 5, he was in a fewry. “What an ass I was to sell, said he, “when all
this money was to be won 1’
“‘And so you were an Ass,” said his particklar friend, CoLoREL CLAw,
K.X.R., a director of the line, ‘a double-eared Ass. My dear feller, the
shares will be at 15 next week. Will you give me your solemn word of
honour not to breathe to mortal man what I am going to tell you?”.
“‘Honour bright,’ says FRED.
“‘Hudson HAs Joined THE LINE.' FRED. didn't say a word more, but
went tumbling down to the City in his Broom. You know the state of
the streats. CLAw went by water.
“‘Buy me one thousand Hafricans for the 30th, cries FRED., busting
into his broker's ; and they were done for him at 44.

“Can't you guess the rest ? Haven't you seen the Share List which
says:– “Great Africans, paid 9d.; price 4 par.”
“And that's what came of my pore dear friend TIMMINs's time-barging.
“What’ll become of him I can't say; for nobody has seen him since.
His lodgins in Jerming Street is to let. His brokers in vain deplores his
absence. His Uncle has declared his marriage with his housekeeper;
and the Morning Erald (that emusing print) has a paragraf yesterday in
the fashnabble news, headed “Marriage in High Life.—The rich and
beautiful Miss MULLIGATAwNEY, of Portland Place, is to be speedily united
to ColoneL CLAw, K.X.R.'
“JEAMEs.”
A DOSE FOR THE QUACKS.
GREAT outcry has been raised of late, in the
Lancet and other journals, against Quacks and
Quackery. Let them not flatter themselves
that it is possible to put either down. The
Quack is a personage too essential to the com-
fort of a large class of society, to be deprived
of his vocation. He is, in fact, the Physician
of the Fools, a body whose numbers and re-
| spectability are by far too great to admit of
anything of the kind. However, as there are
some people in the world who are not fools,
and who will not, when they want a doctor, have
recourse to a Quack, if they can help it, the
practice of the latter ought certainly to be
limited to his proper sphere. For this end, we
would certainly go rather further than SIR JAMEs GRAHAM's sympathies
permitted him to proceed last session. We propose that every Quack
should not only not be suffered to call himself what he is not, but should
be compelled to call himself what he is. We would not only prevent
him from assuming the title of a medical man, but we would oblige him
to take that of Quack. Every vendor of “Life Pills,” “Daffy's Elixir,”
“Dalby's Carminative,” or anything of the kind, we would force, under
a heavy penalty, to write himself down “Quack” upon his brass-
plate; and if we could imprint the same word on his no less brazen forehead,
or, at least, pin it upon his back, we would do that into the bargain.
A Sure Competency.
THERE are again a number of complaints from travellers, who are
detained all day at the Custom House at Folkstone. We think a circu-
lating library, if established in the passengers' room, would answer very
well. If books and periodicals were let out at a reasonable rate, either
by the day or hour, a snug little fortune would be realised in a very short
time. Works inculcating patience and amenity of temper should princi-
pally be selected. A chess-board should decidedly be kept in the room
for the gratuitous use of the two passengers who happened to be the last
on the list.
THE RULE of contRARIES.
The fortifications at Gibraltar were fearlessly shown to M.THIERs, and
Woolwich Arsenal and our Docks have been thrown open to the detractor
of Englishmen with the same unreserve. It is clear the authorities trust
to M. Thiens' habit, as an historian, of misrepresenting everything.
CALL FOR SALE.
O BE SOLD, a RAILWAY CALL, which may be had on very
reasonable terms. It is well adapted for any one who is going on a very long
voyage, and does not intend to come back again. Particulars may be had at the sign
of the Bald-faced Stag, or at the temporary office of the owner, on the third curb-
stone from Capel Court, opposite the Bank of England.

LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH, OR THE
THE THAMES PIERAGE.
REMEMBER, a few years ago,
when there was a talk of
swamping the Peerage, the
threat was declared to be
}}|- ſº unconstitutional ; those who
ventured to suggest that a
few new creations would pre-
serve the Peerage from de-
struction, were called traitors
to their country, snakes in
the grass, or rather, to use
a finer and bolder figure,
crocodiles in the bulrushes.
Since that time, however, a
healthier feeling has sprung
up, and the civic authorities
have set a noble example by
creating a quantity of new
piers, as a cure for the crazy
and ricketty condition of the
old river pierage. Black-
friars has already taken the
oaths, and its seat on the
banks of the Thames, and
the only question that re-
mains to be solved is how
the revenue is to be collected
to support the new pier in his
dignity. It is proposed that
every steam-boat captainshall
payatributeofsixpence when-
ever he makes a call, but if he
makes a call he must of course
leave his card in the shape of
a ticket, or he may come with
a runaway knock against the
sides of the Pier, and, putting
on a good press of steam, cut
away from his liability. Of
course the Pier would have
no remedy, and as the prin-
cipal portion of it consists of
a dummy, it is impossible
that the poor dumb thing
could cry out after the un-
principled captain.
We have an objection to
this collection of tribute-
money, which savours some-
what of the old feudal times,
when the Barons made their
vassals cash up to an extent
that was truly terrible. This
objection is, however, apart from the difficulty there will probably be in
collecting the money, for it is not to be supposed that a gallant captain,
with a bold and adventurous crew under his command, will consent to be
taken into custody by a mere Jack-in-the-water, who is usually the only
authority present at the pier when the vessels call at it. As if the civic
potentates expected an émeute, it is said that no less than six men have
been sworn in as special constables to protect the pier from invasion ;
for it is feared in some quarters that the steam-boat captains may insist
on an unconditional right of visit, in conformity with a treaty which has
had the signatures of Lond ABERDEEN and the French Minister.
The old Pier still remains, clinging affectionately to the side of the new
Pier, and it is expected that when they are torn apart from each other,
the scene will be a very affecting one. The separation between the bridge
and the old Pier, which have
So long together, side by side,
Withstood life's ever-changing tide,
is expected to be one of the most heart-rending and timber-shivering
businesses that was ever known in the neighbourhood.

N the present buoyant state of everything, when pros-
perity flows like a cataract into the pockets of the people,
it is sad to see an attempt made to check the onward roll-
ing of the railway billow. The beautiful fluctuation of the
scrip is like the bounding of the boundless ocean,—now up,
now down, like the dancing wave, as it subsides into
discount, or swells proudly into premium. How shocking,
therefore, is it to find an attempt made to check the cur-
rent of this delicious enterprise. But let us crush and
expose the fallacy of fear, and by a few touches of our
statistical pen at once restore confidence. Let us take
facts, and rush for consolation into the bosom of figures.

“WELL-BELovED PUNCH,- * Hades.

practised the heathenish occupation of acting. And thou, good Punch,
wouldst have rejoiced likewise.
“Ere I died, the times of darkness had again commenced. The law of
the land was changed, and two wicked men, called WILLIAM DAVENANT
and Thomas KILLIGREw, were allowed to revive the abomination of stage-
plays. Truly, my heart was heavy when I departed from the earth.
“But sweet balm of consolation hath, of late, dropped into my wounded
soul. , News hath been brought to me in Hades, that he who now holdeth
one of these patents hath caused plays and interludes to be acted, of such
a very dull and undelectable character, that the worldly who go to witness
them rush home to their beds long before they are concluded. I have
also heard that the same good man doth all he can to suppress the works
of BEN SHAkspeaRE and WILL Jonson, and other abominable poets who
were well known in my day. t -
“Now, worthy Punch, it is evident that this director of stage-plays is a
labourer in the good cause. Only, instead of pulling down galleries and
boxes, he putteth forth such entertainment that those who sit in them
rejoice greatly to leave them, and, questionless, will not return again.
Thus the same end is accomplished with less of violence and heart-
burning; and I have no doubt that had the good men of the year 1647
hit upon the plan, they would not have passed the act before cited, but
another, ordering the Witch and The Girl of Stone (names of interludes,
acted, as I am told, at the present day :) to be played at every theatre
in the cities of London and Westminster, and the liberties thereof. Then
the Justices and the Sheriffs would have had no sort of trouble, but the
people would have left the play-houses of their own accord.
“Thinking that there ought to be some reward to the doer of so good a
work, I propose that he shall be presented with a copy of MASTER
PRYNNE’s Histrio-Mastir, bound in morocco, for the furthering of which
object I hereby endorse a note for five dollars. The coin of the British
realm I cannot send, seeing the same never cometh to Hades, and
therefore I send a note of the United States Bank, which descended here
with all its effects some four years ago.
“THE Ghost of BAREBONES.”
* “If any person ask me the difference between a “stage play' and a ‘common play,'
I answer, that I cite the letter of the good law without being clear as to the interpre-
tation thereof.”—G. of B.
f The knowledge of our friend does not extend to names –Punch.
f What can the ghost mean? . He surely cannot mean the Enchantress and the
Marble Maiden, for we learn that these give universal delight, by the very first authority
– viz., the play-bills of the day. Some wag—probably one of the defunct imitators of
Punch—must have gone to Hades and hoaxed good BARE boxes.—Punch.

T R U E PAT R.I.O.T. Is M.
“Derrynane, October 27th.
ven BELovED CountryMEN, -I write to let you
know my “Rent, becomes due on the 16th of
November. I am proud always to receive this
annual manifestation of your sympathies, because
I am convinced the contributions come from your
hearts. And what noble hearts my countrymen
have 1. Of all the hearts there are no hearts in
the world like Irish hearts.
“I took a walk in my garden this afternoon,
after dinner. The sun was shining—and no-
where does the sun shine so brilliantly as it does
in Ireland—the hills were laughing; the birds
were singing—and no birds can sing so sweetly
as the Irish birds, when they like;—and the
daisies, and the hollyhocks, and the green grass,
all looked so beautiful, that I could not help drop-
ping a scalding tear for very shame that a country
so lovely, so rich as Ireland, should ever have been so brutally trampled
upon by the slaughterous Saxon. But wait awhile, my dear countrymen.
In another six months you shall have Repeal, or else I will give you
leave to take my legs. Recollect, my head I have given you already.
“But, let me return to the rent. I know too well, as soon as the sun
is rising over the green fields of Erin, on the 16th of next month, that
every mother's son of you will be rushing to his priest, eager to prove
which of you shall be the first to pay in his contribution to the fund for
his country's liberation from the grasp of the Sassenagh. I reverence
you for that holy feeling ! I love you for the enthusiasm you evince in
the sacred cause of Repeal; but, my beloved countrymen, keep your
contributions this year. I would not not take the smallest coin from you,
as I love you. How could I, your father, pocket your money, when I
knew my poor children would want every penny they have for the next
winter, when the wind will be coming in at the door, and there will be no
praties to put into the pot? For, have I not just heard that the potato-
crop has failed this year in Ireland? My heartbleeds for you, my poor
countrymen; but be patient, commit no violence, and I promise you
Repeal before you are a year older.
“So, never mindabout the Rent this year. I'll manage as well as I
can without it for ouce, and if you like to make up for it the next time,
why you can. Do not attempt to shake me from my resolution. I am
firm-resolute as the Giants' Causeway. Derrynane fortunately contains
everything. I shall want. There is plenty of game; the rivers swarm
with beautiful fish, and the hills around are covered with sheep; and oh!
my countrymen, where will you see such sheep as there are in Ireland?
“Recollect, no rent—not a half-farthing of tribute this year! This is
the imperative commandof-
“My beloved countrymen,
“Your affectionate father,
“Daniel O'Connell.
“P.S.. I had nearly forgotten to say—
“‘Hereditary bondsmen, know ye not,
Who would be free, themselves must strike the blow ""
SLEEPY OFFICIALS.
Lieut. Bunnell, of H.M.S. Superb, has been tried by Court-
martial, at Plymouth, for sleeping on his watch; has been found guilty,
and is sentenced to be dismissed from Her Majesty's service.
We wonder whether the punishments inflicted in the Navy are
graduated according to the rank of the offender, on the same scale as
that which governs the distribution of rewards. If this same Lieur.
Bunnell, in command of the ship's cutter, had made a gallant dash at a
piratical slaver, and captured her, the reward of his bravery would have
been shared by many—the lion's share being swallowed by those who
had no participation in his danger, nor in the merit of the capture. For
every pound of prize-money that went into the pocket of the lieutenant,
º* go into that of his captain, and a double dose into that of the
-------
Supposing the same graduated scale applied to the infliction of punish-
ment, we should like to know the amount which might reasonably be
expected if a captain were caught mapping, or the admiral were twigged
taking forty winks. We tremble to contemplate the possibility (only that
such a thing, of course, never did, and never can, occur) of a Łº of the
Admiralty sleeping at his post.
We do not desire to justify a sleepy subordinate; but we confess that
this rigorous punishment would jar less upon our feelings if the bitter
and the sweet were always dispensed with an even hand.
JAQUES IN CAPEL COURT.
ALL the world are stags!
Yea, all the men and women merely jobbers!
They have their brokers and their share-accounts,
And one man in his time tries many lines,
The end being total ruin. First, the greenhorn,
Dabbling and dealing in a lucky spec.;
And then the prosperous seller, with his profits
And joyous winning face, buying like mad,
Unwilling to sell out; and then, the loser,
Sighing like furnace, with a woful prospect
Of the next settling day ! Then the director,
Full of strange schemes, and lodged at the West-End,
Keeping a cab, and sudden growing rich,-
Getting a bubble reputation
Even in Capel Court. And then the bankrupt,
With his debts' schedule large, and no assets:
By all his decent friends entirely cut, -
Full of bad scrip, and fertile of fresh schemes;
And so he plays his game. The sixth step sinks
Into the low and herring-gutted stag,
With spectacles on nose and list in hand;
His youthful gains all spent, the world too wide-
-Awake to be ta'en in, and his long line
Of hapless creditors that idly wait
And whistle for their cash. Last scene of all,
That ends this sad but common history,
Is—Union pauperism, and oakum picking :
Sans beer, sans beef, sans tea, sans everything.
THE HOUSE or Braun SWICIR.

We have heard a great deal about the House of Brunswick; and when
it is mentioned at a public dinner, the piston of patriotism has pumped
away at our hearts, without our exactly knowing why or wherefore. We
were always in the dark as to where the House of Brunswick really was,
and imagined that, instead of its being “a local habitation and a name.”
it was simply a name without any local habitation attached to it. We
have, however, ascertained that the House of Brunswick is a great fact,
very near to a great factory at Vauxhall, and is rapidly falling to decay
—a fate that every true patriot must deplore, for the House of Brunswick
seems to be forgetting the principles it was built upon, the walls getting
out of the level, and the foundations crumbling awayasrapidly as possible.
Those Britons who can behave like bricks, may be of use to the House
of Brunswick in its present trying juncture.
Its summer-house is tottering on the margin of the river, and has
fallen head-foremost, as if it were ashamed to show its face. Every true
friend of the Constitution should rush to the Nine Elms pier at Vaux-
hall, and see if anything can yet be done to save the House of Brunswick
from the fate that is impending over it, or, rather, from the river that is
yawning underit. Patriotism may do much, but the plasterer can do more;
and though English enthusiasm may be of some use, we would rather put
the House of Brunswick into the hands of a few stout Irish labourers.

Advertisement Extraordinary.
HORTLY will appear, a New Edition of THE HISTORY OF
ENGLAND, prepared, without regard to cost, under the superintendence of the
Commissioners on the Fine Arts. As this work is intended chiefly for the amusement
of princes and persons about Court, it will partake as much as possible of the
character of a pleasant romance; and, to avoid shocking the nerves of genteel people,
the part of Oliven Cromwell, will be expunged, in lieu whereof will be inserted a
highly elegant Biography of H.R.H. PRINCE ALBERT, F.M., K.G., G.C.B., K.T., K.P.,
G.C.M.G., &c. Copies of this forthcoming publication will, it is said, be deposited, at
the public expense, in the New Houses of Parliament, the oblivion of successful
resistance to regal tyranny being deemed well suited to the subserviency of our
present statesmen.
THE CITY REVOLUTION.
A severe blow has been struck at the civic throne, and the Mansion.
House King has had his authority repudiated by the Governors of Christ's
Hospital. We have looked into the law of high treason, and feel assured
that TRoLLope, the Blue Coat Beadle, has made himself liable to a prae-
munire. The Civic King rang three times at the doors of Christ's Hos-
pital, and was refused admittance. This reminds us of the obstinacy of
the tiers etat, which led immediately to the French Revolution. TRolloFE
is the LALLY TALLENDAlof the 19th century; and unless WHITTLE HARVEY
proves himself a Cockney LA FAYETTE, we don't know what will happen.
The resistance to the City regal authority arises, oddly enough, from a
determination not to render him a correct account of the lists of certain
Governors. GIBBs asking for an account, and being virtuously indignant
at an account being withheld, presents a remarkable instance of cool
effrontery. If the Blue Coat School does not return to its allegiance,
there will be a fearful collision. The police have been sounded, and they
are all very hollow. The City Marshal is supposed to be stanch ; but
nobody knows which party will have the benefit of his stanchness. As
GIBBs must soon resign the throne, it would surely be better for him to
abdicate. His doing so might save—if not blood and treasure—a good
deal of pen, ink, and paper, which must otherwise be wasted in a report
of the squabble.

agricultural chemistry, it is his intention shortly to open a shop for Patent
Medicines, which will cure all defects of soils. He has some Drainage
and Purifying Pills, which he particularly recommends; also a Fertilising
Lotion, and some Productive Powders. His Anti-Blight and Mildew

DESPATCH OF BUSINESS AT THE OLD BAILEY.
THE REcoRDER ON THE BENCH,
THE RECoRDER thought it was very hot.
MR. CLARKSON was of a similar opinion.
The RecordER said, that he remembered when he was a little boy he
had been in the practice of attending school, and he always found himself
exceedingly hot.
MR. Bodkin said he once had a stick which he was very fond of.
MR. BALLANTINE thought that sticks were very useful articles.
MR. PAYNE was of a similar opinion.
MR. BRIEFLEss thought that the law of ejectment was a very important
One.
The REcoRDER thought so also. He suggested that one of the windows
should be opened, as he felt the draught disagreeable.
MR. CLARKson said,—“Talking of windows, I once fell out of a three
pair back; but, wonderful to relate, I fell on my legs, and was not the
least hurt.”
MR. BALLANTINE was surprised to hear that, considering what a heavy
man his learned friend was.
The REcoRDER thought they were talking on subjects which had no
connection with the business of the Court.
The case of “John SMITH versus ELIZABETH BugGINs” was then pro-
ceeded with, and was merely interrupted by about three hundred and
fifty observations from the Bar and the Bench, which had nothing
whatever to do with the business before the Court.
MRS. CAUDLE’S CURTAIN LECTURES.
LECTURE THE LAST.
MRS. CAUDLE HAS TAKEN COLD 1 THE TRAGEDY OF THIN SHOES.
“I’M not going to contradict you, CAUDLE ; you may say what
you like—but I think I ought to know my own feelings better than
you. I don't wish to upbraid you neither; I'm too ill for that: but
it’s not getting wet in thin shoes, oh, no it's my mind, CAUDLE,
my mind, that's killing me. Oh, yes 1 gruel, indeed—you think
gruel will cure a woman of anything ; and you know, too, how I hate
it. Gruel can't reach what I suffer; but, of course, nobody is ever
ill but yourself. Well, I—I didn’t mean to say that ; but when you
talk in that way about thin shoes, a woman says, of course, what she
doesn't mean; she can’t help it. You've always gone on about my
shoes; when I think I’m the fittest judge of what becomes me best.
I dare say,+'twould be all the same to you if I put on ploughman's
boots; but I’m not going to make a figure of my feet, I can tell you.
I’ve never got cold with the shoes I’ve worn yet, and 'tisn't likely
I should begin now.
“No, CAUDLE ; I wouldn't wish to say anything to accuse you :
no, goodness knows, I wouldn’t make you uncomfortable for the world,
—but the cold I’ve got, I got ten years ago. I've never said anything
about it—but it has never left me. Yes; ten years ago the day be-
fore yesterday. How can I recollect it? Oh, very well: women remem-
ber things you never think of : poor souls 1 they’ve good cause to do
so. Ten years ago, I was sitting up for you, there now, I’m not
going to say anything to vex you, only do let me speak: ten years
ago, I was waiting for you, and I fell asleep, and the fire went out,
and when I woke I found I was sitting right in the draft of the key-
hole. That was my death, CAUDLE, though don't let that make you
uneasy, love; for I don’t think you meant to do it.
“Ha! it’s all very well for you to call it nonsense; and to lay
your ill-conduct upon my shoes. That's like a man, exactly There
never was a man yet that killed his wife, who couldn't give a good
reason for it. No : I don't mean to say that you've killed me: quite
the reverse: still, there's never been a day that I havn't felt that
key-hole.
What? Why won't I hare a doctor 2 What's the use of a
doctor : Why should I put you to expense Besides, Idare say you'll
do very well without me, CAUDLE : yes, after a very little time, you
won't miss me much—no man ever does.
“Peggy tells me, Miss PRETTYMAN called to-day. What of it !
Nothing, of course. Yes; I know she heard I was ill, and that’s
why she came. A little indecent, I think, MR. CAUDLE ; she might
wait ; I shan’t be in her way long; she may soon have the key of
the caddy, now.
“Ha! MR. CAUDLE, what's the use of your calling me your dearest
soul now Well, I do believe you. I dare say you do mean it; that
is, I hope you do. Nevertheless, you can't expect I can lie quiet in
this bed, and think of that young woman—not, indeed, that she’s
near so young as she gives herself out. I bear no malice towards
her, CAUDLE—not the least. Still, I don’t think I could lie at peace
in my grave if—well, I won’t say anything more about her; but you
know what I mean. -
“I think dear mother would keep house beautifully for you, when
I’m gone. Well, love, I won't talk in that way if you desire it. Still,
I know I’ve a dreadful cold; though I won’t allow it for a minute to
be the shoes—certainly not. I never would wear 'em thick, and you
know it, and they never gave me cold yet. No, dearest CAUDLE, it’s
ten years ago that did it; not that I’ll say a syllable of the matter to
hurt you. I'd die first.
“Mother, you see, knows all your little ways; and you wouldn't
get another wife to study you and pet you up as I’ve done—a
second wife never does; it isn't likely she should. And after
all, we’ve been very happy. It hasn’t been my fault, if we’ve ever
had a word or two, for you couldn’t help now and then being aggra-
vating; nobody can help their tempers always, especially men.
Still, we’ve been very happy, haven’t we, CAUDLE
“Good night. Yes, this cold does tear me to pieces; but for all
that, it isn’t the shoes. God bless you, CAUDLE ; no, -it's not the
shoes. I won’t say it's the key-hole; but again I say, it’s not the
shoes. God bless you once more—But never say it’s the shoes.”
The above significant sketch is a correct copy of a drawing from
the hand of CAUDLE at the end of this Lecture. It can hardly, we
think, be imagined that Mas. CAUDLE, during her fatal illness, never
mixed admonishment with soothing as before : but such fragmentary
Lectures were, doubtless, considered by her disconsolate widower as
having too touching, too solemn an import to be vulgarized by type.
They were, however, printed on the heart of CAUDLE ; for he never
ceased to speak of the late partner of his bed but as either “his
sainted creature,” or “that angel now in heaven.”
Postscript.
Our duty of editorship is closed. We hope we have honestly
fulfilled the task of selection from a large mass of papers. We could
have presented to the female world a Lecture for Every Night in
the Year. Yes, three hundred and sixty-five separate Lectures 1
We trust, however, that we have done enough. And if we have
armed weak woman with even one argument in her unequal contest
with that imperious creature, man—if we have awarded to a sex, as
MRs. CAUDLE herself was wont to declare, “put upon from the
beginning,” the slightest means of defence—if we have supplied a
solitary text to meet any one of the manifold wrongs with which
woman, in her household life, is continually oppressed by her
tyrannic task-master, man,—we feel that we have only paid back
one grain, hardly one, of that mountain of more than gold it is our
felicity to owe her.
During the progress of these Lectures, it has very often pained
us, and that excessively, to hear from unthinking, inexperienced
men—bachelors of course—that every woman, no matter how di-
vinely composed, has in her ichor-flowing veins, one drop—“no
bigger than a wren’s eye”—of Caudle; that Eve herself may now
and then have been guilty of a lecture, murmuring it balmily
amongst the rose-leaves.
It may be so: still, be it our pride never to believe it. NEVER
*...* There are other CAUDLE PAPERs extant. Some of these may, possibly,
be presented to the universe in our next colume. From these documents
the world will then learn, in the words of his wronged trife, “what an
aggravating man CAUDLE really was 1” Yes; the world will, At
Last, know him, “as well as she did.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
11 L IN PARLIAMENT. An act in
embryo ; or, to use the quaint illus-
tration of the old jurists, a species
of legislative bird that has not
come to its full growth, having only
its bill, without its claws being per-
fected. A bill has to be read
three times, and considered in com-
mittee in each House; and as there
may be a debate at every stage, it
is surprising that any bill, with
all the weight it has to bear, ever
reaches the end of its journey.
When a bill passes one House it
is taken to the other, and when it
is carried from the lower to the
upper, several members of the Com-
mons knock at the door of the Peers, and present their little bill,
when the Speaker of the Lords, who is generally the Chancellor,
takes the bill with much dignity, but returns no immediate answer.
For those who like expensive luxuries, private bills may be had, as
if Brown wished to call himself DE BRow N, or if TIM LINs wished
to quarter the family tea-pot of TIMKTNs with the family scutcheon,
they might either of them accomplish the feat by a private bill at an
enormous outlay.
Brû, or Rights. The name given to the statute 1 William
and Mary, embodying the declaration of rights accepted with the
Crown, on the same principle as a child agrees to swallow a nauseous
but necessary pill, on condition of having something nice to take
with it. The Bill of Rights enacts, among other things, that the
speeches in Parliament ought to be free; but when we see the length
to which the debates run, and how tedious they are, we are inclined
to regard them as being more free than welcome.
Bishop—from the Greek word emorroros, an overlooker; and from
this overlooking the bishop is said to occupy a see. This see is a
capital look-out for those who are lucky enough to obtain it. The
Bishops are spiritual peers, and there are two Archbishops, who have
precedence before all the temporal Lords, except the Lord Chancellor,
who ranks between the two, like the slice of ham betwixt two pieces of
bread-and-butter in a sandwich. The Bishops were formerly elected,
but this system was abolished to prevent the scandal of placards being
stuck about a cathedral town, announcing “HENRY for Exeter,”
“John for York,” and “WILLIAM's Committee sitting daily at the
Marquis of Granby.”
BLAck Rod, Ush ER of THE. An officer of the House of Lords,
who keeps his rod continually in pickle for persons guilty of breaches
of privilege. -
BlockADE. A stoppage of the communication between two points,
the most recent cases of the kind being the blockades of Piccadilly
and Fleet Street. It has been held that when a blockade com-
mences, neutrals may retire, taking with them their cargoes; so that
a neutral omnibus intending to go through Temple Bar, is at liberty
to go back with all its passengers.
BoARD. A word used to denote the heads of any department or
- º -
company, probably because the term “board ” applied to the heads
indicates that they are occasionally wooden.
, Bona Fines. An expression meaning, literally, “good faith,” which
is to be found frequently on the tip of a lawyer's tongue; but
he is not expected to carry it anywhere else about him. The fact
that it is always in his mouth accounts for its going down so very
seldom.
Bonough ENGL1sh. A sort of legal topsy-turvy, by which lands
descend to the youngest scn, instead of the eldest. The land is held
in socage, and goes to the child most likely to wear socks, on account
of his being the youngest. It is the very reverse of Primo-geniture,
and perhaps Ultimo-geniture would be the most proper name
for it.
RAILWAY COURT AND PEERAGE.
As we have now a Railway King in the person of MR. Hudson, it
becomes advisable that we, or rather the Monarch, should also have a
Court. The only Railway Court at present existing, that we know of, is
Capel Court; which, however, with the exception of the stags appertaining
to it, has no one feature of a royal residence. We would propose Hamp-
ton Court as a suitable abode for KING HUDson. QUEEN VICTORIA does
not use it, and (by and with the assent of Parliament) might perhaps
be induced to dispose of it on moderate terms. The numerous placards of
“Steam to Hampton Court” seem to suggest its fitness for this purpose;
only the steam should be transferred from the Thames to a new line of
railway, of which the Palace should be the terminus. A Court having been
provided for Hudson THE FIRST, the next thing requisite would be to furnish
it with courtiers; and this would give occasion for the institution of a Railway
Peerage. Punch, anticipating the functions of His Railway Majesty's
Prime Minister, has much pleasure in offering the King his dutiful advice
with respect to the creation of the new titles. He proposes that the
dukedoms should consist of the principal existing lines, as first in the
order of seniority; so that there should be Dukes of Great Grimsby, of
London and Birmingham, of South Western, selected from eminent share-
holders and directors, as might also be their Graces of the Midland and
| Eastern Counties.
It would likewise be as well, perhaps, to have a Duke of London and
Brighton. The lines next in consequence might afford Marquisates,
Earldoms, and Baronies. There would thus be a Marquis of Croydon,

hold it? The shorter plan would have been, to reduce the Income-Tax.

PUNCH, OR THE
201
LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE -
opening of LINcoLN's-INN HALL.
It having been announced that HER MAJEsty and
PRINcE ALBERT were to be present at the opening of
Lincoln’s-Inn Hall, we became tenants-at-will of an
apple-stall, and purchased the vested remainder of a
lamp-post of a boy who was clinging to the same, but
who having lost his interest by laches, enabled us to have
and to hold on—in a position commanding a capital
view of the procession. The Benchers had, with their
usual courtesy, made arrangements for the accommo-
dation of the gentlemen of the Press, by allowing them
to join in the press outside the gates of the Inn; but
it was intimated that the representatives of the prin-
cipal daily papers would have the privilege of mixing
with the ticket-porters, so as to be able to pick up
from them what was going on, and furnish a full report
of it.
Punch, of course, had only to send his name up to
the LonD CHANcellon to obtain ready access to every
part of the building; but he felt so indignant against the
Benchers for their treatment of the general body of the
Press, that he declined mixing in the festivities of the
day with that cordiality and good humour that would
otherwise have beamed from his patronising countenance.
The entertainment consisted of a walk in the library,
a dull speech from the Treasurer, and some cold chicken.
HER MAJEsty graciously manifesting an interest in the
library, asked what books it contained, when the Trea-
surer alluded to a fine copy of “Viner's Abridgment.”
The Queen, naturally supposing it to be a little pocket
duodecimo, requested to be allowed to take it home
with her to peruse at her leisure, when the Treasurer
pointed to some eighty-six folio volumes. The Queen
immediately recoiled, and observed with some'smart-
ness, that if this Abridgment of VINER was a specimen
of legal conciseness, legal prolixity must be truly over-
whelming. HER MAJEsty was also shown a very rare
old copy of “Hare on Discovery,” which PancE
ALBERT said he should like to read, as he was anxious
to get himself well up in the subject of the Game
Laws.
The Treasurer shortly afterwards read an address,
poising himself all the while on one knee, and HER
MAJESTY seemed to be much more struck by the nicety
with which he preserved his equilibrium: than by the
matter of the discourse, which was somewhat tedious.
In the course of the déjeuner, the Treasurer once or twice
attempted a joke, but as nobody laughed except himself
and a waiter, the learned gentleman desisted from the
melancholy effort. The Queen was somewhat annoyed at
being conducted backwards and forwards merely to give
her an idea of the extent of the building, and ultimately
HER MAJEsty made the remark, that she knew to what
lengths lawyers would go, and it was therefore unne-
cessary to give her the trouble of going over the whole
area of the premises.
On the whole, the ceremony would have been satisfac-
tory, but for the ungentlemanly trick of bringing the
Reporters to the Hall by tickets of invitation, which were |
only designed as “a delusion, a snare, and a mockery;” |
to trap them into a position in which they might be
insulted by being thrust into a sort of black hole at the back of
a buttery screen, with a heap of waiters. It was understood
that this piece of poor spite was intended to pay off the Press
for having called the Bar to its senses with reference to the circuit
dispute; but we, who have some regard for the credit of the profes-
sion, believe the cards of invitation to have been a hoax got up by
some wretched “Utter” who had gone stark mad from hopeless
brieflessness.
The PRINCE wore a Bencher's gown over a Field_Marshal's uni-
form ; an arrangement about as picturesque as a nightcap over a
Templar's casque, or a pinafore over a breastplate. The ceremony
of making the PRINce a Bencher was necessarily preceded by calling
him to the Bar and giving him a brief, which consisted of a rule to
compute the number of persons present at the déjeiner.
Port RAIT
of Tile
RAILway Panic.
His Royal
| Highness' first and only brief was endorsed in the usual
form, marked “10s. 6d.,” the regular fee, and having the
words “With you, MR. SMITH,” at the bottom of it.
As the QUEEN quitted the Hall, two enthusiastic Utters,
in imitation of RALE1GH, threw, the one his gown, the
other his pocket-handkerchief, for HER MAJESTY to
walk over. The QUEEN, pausing, as if to observe which
was the cleaner of the two—both being devoted to
dirty work—smiled at the intended compliment, —not
a very graceful one, by-the-bye—and stepped between
the articles without touching either.
RAILWAY WENTILATION.
By an ingenious contrivance, the roofs of the carriages
on the Southampton Railway are so constructed, that they
will admit the air; but unfortunately this convenience is in
some degree neutralised by the wholesale pouring in of
water. In summer weather, when it is desirable to keep
the head cool, these colander-like roofs to the carriages
are well enough ; but in winter, the double entrance of
blasts from Boreas, and showers from old NIMBus, is by
no means agreeable. The only real danger arises from the
possibility of the water rising to such a height in the car-
riages as to drown the passengers ; but we believe every
vehicle is provided with one of the Humane Society's drags,
in case of accident.
SIR ROBERT'S SPADE.
WE all know how children are sometimes taught
their alphabet by cakes. A gingerbread A B C pecu-
liarly recommends such elements of learning to their
business and bosoms. They are made scholars without
knowing it. They digest vowels and consonants, and
only relish more and more the increasing difficulty. We
see it: the landed interest have laid some such trap for
the unsuspecting PEEL. Whether or no, they will make
him taste the sweets of agriculture; and, true to the reign-
ing spirit of the day, they have caught him with a railway
bait. A paragraph has appeared, sta'ing that SIR Rob LRT
was about to turn “the first sod of the Trent Valley
Line;” to which end a magnificent spade has been
manufactured by MR. MALEHAM, of Sheffield. Here is
its description : enough to draw water into the mouth
of an Arcadian :-
\
º
º
º
º
º
with polished maple handle, and on the blade SIR. R. PEEL's coat of arms,
inlaid with gold. The straps of the spade are beautifully etched. It is
enclosed in a rosewood case, lined with blue ultramarine velvet. On the
lid is a silver name plate, with the inscription, “SIR. Rob ERT PEEL,
BART., M.P., Drayton Manor.”
What a lure is this to SIR Robert, to win him to
the agricultural interest : To make him hold by the
spade to the last ! To this end it is “mighly finished,”
that Labour may see its smiling face reflected in it !
And then the handle is “polished maple,” pleasant to
| the touch ; and the “inlaid gold,” so typical of the
wealth of the labourer, whilst the rosewocq case, and
the blue ultramarine velvet, shadow forth his happy
home and luxurious bed. Sia RoRERT, however, ought
to have been fittingly habited for the occasion. A white
satin smock-frock, Genoa velvet breeches, silk stockings,
and patent-leather shoes, with diamond buckles in them,
would have finished the picture of one of our bold peasantry—our
country’s pride. Some folks, however, who will see mischief in every-
thing, see quite another meaning in SIR Robert's splendid spade :
they contend that it only prefigures some cutting measure of his
on the Corn Laws, a measure, to be made as pleasing in appear-
ance as SIR Rob ERT's peculiar genius can make it, but that, never-
theless—for all the gilding and soft velvet that may be associated
with it—is intended to go at once to the root of the question. The
colour, “ultramarine,” is supposed to carry some allusion to corn
from beyond the seas.

Who ate good beef and wore fine wool, Had greenhorns made their study and theme ;
And bragg’d each morn that none could pull They set their wits to work by steam,
From his breeches-pocket a purse more full. And they wheedled him into their swindling scheme !

That purse he'd fill'd by honest pains, The fastest way to wealth, they said,
But, not content with his lawful gains, Would be by steam to go ahead;
To add to his store he rack'd his brains, And thus by the nose their dupe was led,
To get more money and new domains. Till John was caught in the net they spread.
Ri tooral, looral, &c. Ri tooral, looral, &c.
Some humbugs great in depredation, They made him a hobby to ride upon,
Came and made him a long oration; With a strong steam-power to move it on ;
They wanted a flat for victimisation, And all his sober senses gone,
So they got him to dabble in speculation. They bound thereto the foolish John.
Ri tooral, looral, &c. | Ri tooral, looral, &c.
Said John, “Your plan my mind contents, But first before they bade him start,
I'm sick and tired of the Three per Cents; With wondrous craft and singular art,
And don't get enough by my paltry rents:” To lighten his weight, they made him part
So he got hooked in by the Railway “gents.” With the money that lay so near his heart.

THE MATRIMONIAL DISTRICTS.
The QUEEN of Spain, it is now settled, is to marry a Saxe-Coburg.
The Agricultural Society, we hear, intend sending their gold medal to the
GRAND DURR, in admiration of the very great perfection to which he has
carried in his possessions the art of husbandry.
TEIE FLEET STREET PASS.
Now that Term has commenced, the gentlemen of the Bar will
have to effect the awful pass from the Temple to Chancery Lane,
which seems to threaten almost innumerable difficulties. The
blending of ravine and rubbish may be picturesque, but it is highly
inconvenient; and to a Barrister in his wig and gown, the expedi-
tion must be one of extreme awkwardness. It is believed that guides
will be stationed at the foot of Chancery Lane and the Temple, to
escort the traveller across the dangerous heights and depths he will
have to encounter. Leaping-poles will be provided at Gaoon's, the
pastrycook's.
THE STATE OF THE SUBURBS.
OUR efforts to throw the light of civilisation and gas along the Ken-
sington Road have been successful, but our triumph over the obstinacy
of the government of that suburb will not be complete till we have paved
the way for the progress of the human race, which is now obliged to walk
up to its knees in mud for want of the footpath being properly attended
to. The pass, from the station of our own snug little suburban Railway
to the northern frontier on the one hand, and the bush of the Shepherds
on the other, is in wet weather a sort of Pontine marsh in miniature. The
passage is exceedingly dangerous, and, indeed, has been compared to the
Goodwin Sands, for it is very possible that a nurserymaid starting with a
cargo of children may founder on the frightful flats and mud shoals of
that barbarous district. The authorities met the other day at the pump
to consider what was to be done; and one of the body being unanimously
called to the spout, he held forth with copious eloquence for nearly a
quarter of an hour. It was ultimately agreed to offer to buy the Ken-
sington Railway at the price of old iron, and lay it down instead of pave-
ment as far as it would go, by way of experiment.
Parliamentary statues.
It is the patriotic intention of O'Connell to attend in the House of Com-
mons to oppose the proposition to erect statues to Bacon and Oliven Chom-
well. The learned gentleman will meet the motion with an amendment
that shall substitute for the aforesaid worthies, the statues of Guy FAwkes
and—himself. Will the bold-hearted conspirator feel flattered by the
association ? We think not.
ChapTER OF ACCIDENTS.
PERsons have seriously recommended Smithfield Market as a railway
terminus, on account of the number of accidents which occur there every
year. We really do not see how a railway is likely to lessen the number
of accidents; but the fact of Bartholomew's Hospital being on the spot,
is certainly a great recommendation in favour of the Terminus.

in a former instance— bagged his men, and doubtless tasted on his pillow that sweet repose
that ever waits upon a good deed, when, in brief season, Mn.
|ColleTT, M.P. for Athlone, sent the imprisoned poachers five
pounds. The men escaped : and those of our readers who remember
“Had been stained by the most irreligious and lying perjury that ever came from
the lips of a criminal endeavouring to screen his fellows from the consequence of sin.”
These are serious, nay, solemn words. The pious game-preserver,
in the excess of his abhorrence of human infirmity, crowds epithet
on epithet; the perjury committed is, strange to say, both irreligious
and lying. And then the consequence of sin . We have no doubt
that MR. BERKELEY looks upon the iniquity of a poacher with the
same horror that a priest of old Egypt would have considered any
offence committed on the animals sacred to his temple,_and for the
same profound and touching reason. The pheasant and hare are to
the religion of the squire what the ibis and the crocodile were to the
devotion of the ancient hierarch. They are solemn things, sanctified
to the especial uses of sporting gentlemen; they are the sacred
creatures of the acres—formed and sent into this world for the sole
delectation of the upper classes, the gunpowder priests, licensed to
hunt and shoot. Nevertheless, we respect the prejudices of MR.
BER RELEY, as we respect the ignorance of any idolater, “suckled in
a creed outworn.”
But are only the rich to have their prejudices ! Are not poachers,
as well as landed gentlemen, to have, at least, their share of human
the glum and baffled look of some necromancer of the Black Forest,
when, in a pantomime, he sinks through a trap at the approach of
the Good Fairy, may possibly conceive the dignified ire of the
Member for Bristol, defeated in his legal wrath by the Member for
Athlone. Some folks may think the intrusion very impertinent;
whilst some may give thanks that whilst the country possesses
certain squires, it does not wholly want a Robin Hood.
MR. Collett, however, does not pass without a lecture on the
improper use of his money. The pious BERKELEY says:—
| “I can furnish him with a list of deserving poor [of Athlone], to whom his gifts
will be gracious in the eyes of God and man, and not premiums upon vice, as in the
present instance.”
|. Really, it is passing sweet, in these selfish, money-getting days, to
|fall upon matter like this, where religion, by the happy nature of the
writer, is so constantly rendered the handmaid to sporting. Old
| authors were wont to commence every canto or chapter with an
invocation to the Deity. We can almost imagine a sportsman, so

lips of some reverend man denouncing the commission of murder,

with Uncle Toby to whistle Lillibullero !
take aim without some such ceremony; nay, can fancy him so
associating religion with shooting, that he shall ram down every
charge with a leaf of the Prayer-Book.
Well, a few days pass, and the great Game Preserver makes an
amended charge against his old enemies, released by MR. Collett, of
“unlawfully using a dog.” The dog, it was proved, ran after a hare—

the sacred animal luckily escaped—whilst the men, it was shewn,
were mowing. The charge was dismissed by the magistrate, as-
“It ought to be proved that they were actually and in fact hunting with the dog,
whereas by the evidence produced they were all lawfully employed in mowing their
master's corn; and while they were doing so, the shepherd's dog accidentally started a
hare.”
MR. BEakel EY was defeated, although it was plain he had dressed
himself for conquest, taking his seat on the Bench, “in his shooting
attire,”—doubtless, prepared, like a sporting BRENNUs, to cast his
powder-horn and shot-belt in the scale of justice, which, unhappily
for his piety, did not turn against the accused.
JEAMES’S DIARY.
NE day in the panic week, our friend JEAMEs
called at our Office, evidently in great perturba-
tion of mind and disorder of dress. He had
no flower in his button-hole; his yellow kid
gloves were certainly two days old. He had
not above three of the ten chains he usually
sports, and his great coarse knotty-knuckled old
hands were deprived of some dozen of the
rubies, emeralds, and other cameos with which,
since his elevation to fortune, the poor fellow
has thought fit to adorn himself.
“How's scrip MR. JEAMEs,” said we plea-
santly, greeting our esteemed contributor.
“Scrip be —,” replied he, with an expression we cannot repeat, and a
look of agony it is impossible to describe in print, and walked about the
parlour whistling, humming, rattling his keys and coppers, and showing
other signs of agitation. At last, “Mr. Punch,” says he, after a
moment's hesitation, “I wish to speak to you on a pint of businiss. I
wish to be paid for my contribewtions to your paper. Suckmstances is
haltered with me. I—I—in a word, can you lend me £ for the
account :".
He named the sum. It was one so great, that we don't care to mention
it here ; but on receiving a cheque for the amount (on MEssas. PUMP
AND ALDGATE, our bankers), tears, came into the honest fellow's eyes.
He squeezed our hand until he nearly wrung it off, and, shouting to a cab,
| he plunged into it at our office-door, and was off to the City.
Returning to our study, we found he had lefton our table an open pocket-
book; of the contents of which (for the sake of safety) we took an inventory.
It contained:— three tavern-bills, paid ; a tailor's ditto, unsettled ;
forty-nine allotments in different companies, twenty-six thousand seven
hundred shares in all, of which the market value we take, on an average,
to be + discount; and in an old bit of paper tied with pink riband a lock
of chesnut hair, with the initials M. A. H.
In the diary of the pocket-book was a Journal, jotted down by the pro-
prietor from time to time. At first the entries are insignificant; as, for
instance:– “3rd January—Our beer in the Suvnts' Hall so precious
small at this Christmas time that I reely muss give warning, & wood, but
for my dear MARY HANN.” “February 7–That broot Screw, the Butler,
wanted to kis her, but my dear MARY HANN boxt his hold hears, & served
him right. I datest Schew."—and so forth. Then the diary relates to
Stock Exchange operations, until we come to the time when, having
achieved his successes, MR. JAMEs quitted Berkeley Square and his livery,
and began his life as a speculator and a gentleman upon town. It is
from the latter part of his diary that we make the following
** EXTRAX:-

COMFORT FOR THE QUEEN.
THAT beautiful Tom Noddy of the Press, the Morning Post, had
some delicious nonsense about the opening of the New Hall of
Lincoln’s-Inn. Having moaned over “the depression” of which
monarchy “is now the sufferer,” it still finds comfort in the hope
that, “if, again, high should rise the tide of insolence and sedition,”
and “even if palace and tower should go to the ground,” why even
then, “in the Hall of Lincoln’s-Inn, would—as did in the Spanish
mountains the Gothic Royalty of old”— [the parallel is very clear]—
“the English Royalty find at least a home.” We shall never pass
Lincoln’s-Inn Hall without, in our mind’s eye, seeing an inscribed
bill in one of the windows—“Apartments ready furnished for
destitute Kings and Queens.”

AN enterprising manager is about to build a theatre at Folkstone, for
the amusement of the persons who are detained so many hours at the
Custom House. The performances take place during the day, and the
charges of admission are to be so much an hour. A change of pieces
every packet. This theatre will also have the great advantage of receiving
the French pieces half a day sooner than any of the London theatres.
Arrangements have been made to have the dramas translated on board the
packet, during its passage from Boulogne to Folkstone. The theatre will
be opened under the patronage of the Officers of the Custom House.

A GREAT deal of inconvenience and anxiety having been occasioned by

R. S. and M. P. are earnestly entreated to return to their Railways.

UNsophisticATED as we were, we used to think that success was a thing
to be desired by a dramatist. The Poet BUNN has, however, enlightened
us on this point. In his advertisement of Tuesday, November 4th, he
describes The Princess Who Was Changed Into A Deer, as “one of
the most successful pieces ever produced on this stage.” The success of
the piece in question consisted in its having been laughed at, hissed at, and
hooted at with a determination unprecedented. We shall henceforth pray
that all our dramatic friends may be unsuccessful.

It is very evident that the way to the heart of the City is through the
stomach. A few days ago there was a stormy debate in the Common
Council on the proposition to exclude from voting on railway matters all
who had a share or any concern in the management of railways. Every
effort was made to get rid of the discussion ; but nothing would avail to
put a stop to it, until a citizen, more cunning than the rest, thought of
bringing the dinner-hour to the recollection of the assembly. He had no
sooner said the words, than the question of adjournment was put in fifty
places, and declared to be unanimously carried. The point, which others
had been endeavouring by all sorts of indirect means to arrive at, was
thus attained immediately, and the discussion brought to a close. Nº.
can stop the mouth of an eloquent Common Councilman but dinner ; an
the magic word “dinner-hour” at once dispersed the concourse of civic
Orators.

The Duke of York, who owes thousands, has a handsome monument.

worthy of the accounts of ALDERMAN Gibbs, for it does not seem likely
ever to be “settled at bottom.”

not hope they will, be converted to a very useful purpose. The rotten

would serve admirably for pelting Repeal agitators off their platforms.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SERMONS IN STONES.
We were looking at the Gothic ornaments of the New Lincoln's Inn
Hall the other day, and wondering what object the architect could have
had in making them so repulsively ugly. e asked an intelligent mason,
who evidently saw the fix we were mentally in, and the ingenuous fellow
spoke as follows:—“Why, Sir, you see they have been made ugly on
purpose.
“MR. HARDwicke's design, Sir, was to make them so hideous that
they should frighten silly people, if possible, from going to law. ... Each of
the heads about the building has
a meaning in it. That ugly old
woman there, sir, in the off corner,
with a mouth large enough for the
river Thames, is a tearing of her
hair, because she has lost a Chan-
cery suit she had begun at the age
of 22. The suit was against her
dearest friend, so you can imagine
how savage she must have been
when she lost it. The matter
in dispute was of no consequence
to either, but by the good-natured
suggestions of friends and the
* unwearied exertions of the law-
yers, the suit lasted three Lord
Chancellors, to say nothing of a
number of Vices. It was at last
given against the lady on the spout; and the above is a correct portrait taken
of her at the moment of her learning
the decision.
“The barrister, whom you see crawling
in the gutter, is a celebrated Old Bailey
lawyer. He is represented in the above
attitude on account of his stooping to
any kind of dirty work, with the view
of getting on. In the corner of his left
eye you will notice there is a tear. It
is a faithful copy of a memorable one he
shed at the trial of a murderer, when he
swore to his innocence. He is gnashing
his teeth in rage, because no jury after-
wards would believe him. He was
obliged to leave the bar, and he is put
up there as a warning to young bar-
risters, who have not yet begun to
“utter.” The old gentleman near him,
just over the Treasurer's apartment, is
the likeness done in stone, of a celebrated
Alderman. He was a churchwarden, and
threw a whole parish, poor and all, into
Chancery, because they expressed a desire
to look at his accounts, after one-and-
twenty years. Only look at him, how he
is affecting to be a martyr His face is
considered to be a most perfect bit of
chiselling. At first his hands were closed,
but they were afterwards opened, to
express his habit of grasping at every-
thing.
“The judge, to his right, is the
fac-simile of a well-known Chancellor,
who has an extraordinary talent for
speaking on both sides, and at all
times. This is the reason he is held
up to ridicule as an empty spout. The
other heads are in the same vigorous
way, all taken from the life. There
are trustees, cruel guardians, game-
preservers, bad landlords and tenants,
and oppressive masters, of every hi-
deous variety. All the bad passions, "
on which the law feeds and fattens,
are there depicted in their true ugli-
ness, so that the public may see that
they are the real pillars that support
a legal institution like the present. -----
They are done in stone, as being the -lºº
best material to express the hard ---
hearts of those who make it their
business to go to law.”
We thanked the mason for the lec- -
ture he had read us in illustration of
MR. Handwicke's expressive imps and eloquent monsters, that, with a
|
|
prodigality of diablerie, he has thrown about the building; but as we left
them; we could not help feeling that the legal scarecrows which the archi-
tect has hung over every door of the benchers' granary to warn all birds
of prey from the fields of litigation, would drive very few away, for it is
well known that persons do not rush into Chancery with their eyes open.
But as they return, they may not be so stone-blind to the many pointed
moralities of the new Lincoln’s-Inn Hall; and this instruction, enforced
by an empty pocket, may prevent them paying the domains of Chancery
a second visit.
WOOD STOCK ELECTION.
AN address to persons, jocularly called by the House of Blenheim
the Electors of Woodstock, has appeared in the papers, purporting to
be written by Lond Alf RED Chunchill. The address makes him
speak of “those feelings of good-will and kind-heartedness with
which, upon the strength of old family interests and connections,
they have so kindly, so unhesitatingly, and so unanimously received
his humble pretensions.” It need not be said that this address is a
forgery. The thing speaks for itself: Load Church ILL is a
soldier, and would not insult the unfortunate. We are exclusively
enabled to print the real address, issued by his lordship to his father's
tenants :-
“To THE ELECTORs of wooDSTOCK.
“Serfs, I have been among you ; and I am glad to say that among
three-hundred-and-eighty bondmen, I have only found four rebellious
varlets who have refused me their votes. I am happy to find that you
know so well what you owe to the House of Blenheim, as you evidently
do not forget what the House of Blenheim owes to you.
“My military duties call me away to drill ; but fear not, I shall return
to drill you : and if any of you are found disobedient to the word of com-
mand, it is possible—but I scorn to threaten any free and independent
elector of Woodstock. Ha! hal
“I am, your master's son,
“ALFRED SPENCER CHURCHILL.”
OPENING OF THE RAILWAY PARLIAMENT.
When we hear of Railways being carried along the streets of
London supported on the iron posts of the gas-lamps, and other inge-
nious contrivances; when we tumble over surveyors at every turn,
taking levels, and sometimes unexpectedly finding their own by a
sudden collision with somebody coming sharp round a corner; when
all this is going on in the streets of London, we feel quite certain
that there must be a Railway Parliament; that is to say, a
Parliament devoting itself exclusively to Railway business, ent rely
separate from the legislature employed in the ordinary work of the
Session. Every established line should be allowed to send two
members, while the new schemes should each return a representative,
the privilege of voting being conferred on those who have paid their
deposits. The Stag districts might perhaps be allowed one member
to protect their interests; and every person who had signed his
name to a deed for any one else, should be considered a bond ſide
Stag for election purposes. In the debates the members could allude
to each other, as the honourable representatives of the line that
might have returned them ; or, if in the Upper House, the titles of
Lord Thames Embankment, the Marquis of Central Terminus,
Baron Broad Gauge, and Earl Atmospheric, would be extremely
appropriate. The absorbing interest of Railways renders a Railway
Parliament absolutely indispensable, and we recommend the forma-
tion of one at the earliest possible period. London is apparently to be
laced with iron-work, and we really believe that the thoroughfares
have all been blocked up to give the engineers an excuse and oppor-
tunity for taking levels, or calculating gradients, without being
disturbed by the traffic. We saw with our own eyes an eminent
engineer making an estimate of the mean inclination of Holborn
Hill, standing in the middle of the road amid the cries of “Now,
spooney!” “Can't you get out of the way, stupid?” and a hundred
other complimentary exclamations from the passing cads and cab-
drivers. We have Metropolitan Junctions that are to go all round
London without going into it—a convenience that those who are in
the habit of taking a circult of the entire outskirts of London will
duly appreciate, and there is to be a line to run people up and
down Milbank, where nobody goes, with an extension to the Temple

devils who are starving l—actually starving ! To be going round for
money just now in Ireland—to take the last pence of the poor, ragged,
kindly, hungry, foolish creatures—it turns my gorge somehow.
| poor devils' money. For the credit of us adventurers, who live on
PUNCH's TRIBUTE TO O'CONNELL.
s the day comes round when the grate-
ful millions, whom you are making so
wise, industrious, and happy, are club-
bing their halfpence for your benefit,
it becomes us all, dear DAN, to offer
our quota of admiration to you ; and
I hereby send you my contribution,
in a coin with which you are yourself
in the habit of relieving the neces-
sitous—I mean a little slackjaw. In
a case of necessity in your country,
you are always the very first to come
down with a subscription of that sort.
And I wish to Heaven that poor
Paddy, who has no lack of the com-
modity, and takes it from you so
kindly, would but pay you back, in
this present hard season, in the same circulating medium. I am
not averse to the subscription-box at most times. A good crºwd—a
good rattling scene between me and Judy, or me and the devil—and,
* now, gentlemen and ladies,” my man goes round for the subscrip:
tion, and the coppers come tumbling into the tin. I don't like that
vulgar cant of calling it a begging-box: we are worthy of our hire,
both of us.
But there are times and seasons to take the money from poor
You
can't be going to accept the money. Do without this time. If you
have none, go down to Derrynane, and go tick; but don't take the
the public, and who are said to be good-natured and free-handed-
rogues as we are—stop the collection of the coppers, just for this
once. I know the old gag about “forsaking great professional
emoluments,” and so forth. But let them of this time—the poor
starving rogues—the good-natured simple Paddies, who roar at all
your jokes, huzzay at all your lies, come leagues upon leagues to
attend your show, and have paid their money so often I
“Dives and Lazarus” is bad enough, and the contrast of the poor
man's sores and the rich man's purple. But put it that Dives ab-
solutely begged the money from Lazarus, and grows fat while the
other starves, it will be even so if you take these folks' money—but
I am again growing too serious. -
Not that I quarrel with a joke, my dear professional friend, or am
jealous of yours; but I think, of these latter days, you have been a
trifle too facetious. That excessive good humour the which you
have flung into the discussion of the Starvation Question—or rather
that airy gaiety with which you have eluded it—hopping facetiously
away from it when pressed upon you, and instead of talking
about the means of preventing your countrymen's ruin, telling a
story about the coolness of the Lond LIEUTENANT's rooms, or having
a fling at the Saxon, or telling a lie about the Times' Commissioner,
struck me as rather out of place. A joke is a joke, and nothing can
be more pleasing than a lie (we will call it a hoax) in its proper place
—but not always. You wouldn't cut capers over a dead body, or be
particularly boisterous and facetious in a chapel or a sick-room; and
I think, of late, dear Sir, you have been allowing your humour to get
the better of you on occasions almost as solemn. For, isn't Hunger
sacred isn't Starvation solemn ! And the Want of a nation is staring
DANIEL O'Connell in the face, and the LIBERATOR replies with a
grin and a jibe.
All the country is alarmed by the danger, and busy devising
remedies to meet it. The gentlemen of Kerry subscribe 8000l.—the
LIBERATOR subscribes, the Advice that corn shall not be sent out of
the country. The Lond LIEUTENANT does all that such a feeble,
absurd ceremony as a Lord Lieutenant can do—gives a ceremony
of consolation; says, Government has employed scientific men, will
send for others, and so forth. DAN sneers at the scientific men
because they are Saxons, and fancies he covers his own astounding
selfishness and indifference by this brutal claptrap. The people come
flocking to Conciliation Hall to know what DAN will do—what he'll
propose, God bless him 1 that's to get them out of the scrape and
he puts up MR. Dillon Baowne to indulge in ribald jokes against
Agricultural Societies; and he himself amuses the meeting with a
piece of lying buffoonery about the Times' Commissioner. He owns
it is a lie; boasts and chuckles over the lie. “If he wasn't turned
out of the house, as I declared he was, he ought to have been turned
out,” and all the audience roar. What an audience, and what an
orator Think of the state of mind of the poor fellows who have
been got to like and listen to such matter! who, perishing themselves
with hunger, still feed and fatten him to whom in their extremity
(when every man with a heart in his breast is devising plans for
their rescue) the old cynic, who wallows in their bounty, does not
offer a shilling; but for all advice, jeers and belies their English
brethren who, by God's help, are able and willing to assist them,
and for all consolation entertains them with lies and lazzis. I think
it was the French newspapers who called you the Irish Moses; and
now the people are calling upon their deliverer, and behold, out
comes JAck PUDDING !
My brazen old brother buffoon If I had the ear of your Paddies
in Conciliation Hall I would tell them a story:—“During the Consul-
ship of PLANcus, when I was green and young, I had a dear friend,
who for some years made a very comfortable income out of me, by
cheating me at cards. He was an exceedingly agreeable, generous,
social fellow, and professed and felt, no doubt, a warm regard for
me; for he used always to win and I to pay with unalterable con-
fidence and good-humour. I furnished his house for him, I paid his
tailor's bills, I kept the worthy fellow in pocket-money. Win what
he would, I wouldn't believe he was a cheat. At last, as I insisted on
not discovering his practices, my jolly friend did not give himself the
trouble to hide them; and one day, when we were playing a friendly
game at écarté together, I saw him with a selection of eight or nine
trumps and court cards comfortably spread in his lap, from which he
supplied his hand as he wanted.”
God save the Greens ! I leave the amateurs of good jokes on the
other side of the Channel to determine the moral of this fable. Who
are the green ones there? and whose confidence and blindness are so
inconceivable, that the old sharper who takes their money scorns
even to hide the jugglery by which he robs them.

THE WRONGS OF THE BLUES. * *
This ill-fated regiment has no sooner succeeded in fighting the battle
of Bankruptcy, than it finds itself called upon to struggle with short
commons. The whole regiment has been basely and brutally put upon coffee,
which is forced down the throats of the gallant fellows twice a day, their
money being also stopped to pay for the objectionable wash, so that the
insult is accompanied by injury. To use the emphatic language of a
veteran ‘Blue, the men are condemned to walk about with tears in
their eyes and twopence in their pockets. The valorous fellows are so
averse to the beverage, that they are being drilled into it twice a day;
and the word of command is regularly given to “Draw coffee,” “Present
milk,” “Carry sugar,” and “Recover cup,” all, which manoeuvres are
executed in a soldierlike manner.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
© ounty. A fine name for a mean action, as the
giving of a paltry shilling to a raw recruit,
who is called raw from the facility with
which he is done on the occasion of en-
listment. Bounties were formerly given
to merchants as an encouragement to
them to enter into all sorts of unprofitable
º trades, such as catching white herrings
when they had other fish to fry; by which
Q the merchants lost, in the middle of the
--- last century, a joint stock of 500,000l.
The miserable bounty was all they got ;
and it may have been called, literally, a
sprat given to catch a herring.
Bounty, QUEEN ANNE's. A fund for
: the augmentation of small livings, which
is vulgarly supposed to come out of QUEEN
ANNE's pocket, but which is nothing
more than their first fruits and tenths,
taken from larger livings to augment smaller. It is, in fact, stealing
from PETER to give to PAUL ; and as PETER can very well afford
to be robbed, while PAUL is very hard up, the arrangement seems to
be proper and justifiable.
BREvet. A military swindle, enabling the Captain to swagger as
the Major, and the Major to give himself the airs of a Colonel, out of
their respective regiments. There is a case in the books, of an indi-
vidual who called himself, on his cards, GENERAL Jones, but on
inquiry he was found to have availed himself of a sort of Brevet or
Brevity; for the title, GENERAL Jon Es, was an abbreviation of
Under-Deputy Sub-Assistant Vice-Commissary GENERAL Jon Es—
which was the real character of this gentleman, who disliked con-
descending to particulars, and therefore adhered to the general in
his description of his own status. GRose, in his Military Anti-
quities, tells us that the custom of giving soldiers, by brevet, higher
rank than they hold, is very ancient; and refers us to the Soldier's
Grammar, written in the time of JAMEs THE FIRst, for his authority.
With all respect for GRose, we look upon it as gross humbug to
call a man what he is not ; and we are happy to see that the custom
has declined, for there are now very few who hold the rank to which
they are not entitled. There is still, however, a travelling brevet,
which is taken advantage of by men who have served their country
—out, by running into debt, and then running away altogether.
Baibény has a three-fold application—to judges, ministers, and
voters for members of Parliament. The offence of bribing the
judges was formerly very common ; but happily, in these days, the
legal dignitaries are far too good judges to take a bribe, and the
people are not so ill-judged as to offer one. In the reign of Edward
THE THIRD, SIR WILLIAM THonpE kept verdicts and decisions
constantly on sale in Westminster Hall, and he was, on his own con-
fession, condemned to be hanged ; but he was a few years afterwards
in business again as Chief Justice; so that it is possible they gave
him rope enough to hang himself, when he naturally enough declined
taking himself in execution. In JAMEs the Fiast's time, judicial
bribery was still a trade; for Bacon confesses to have been guilty
of it, though he pleasantly excuses himself by calling it, ritium
temporis—the vice of the time—as if he had caught it like the
measles, or any other natural malady. Judicial bribery is now quite
extinct, and there is no remnant of it, except in the old custom of
giving refreshers, which formerly consisted of beer. and mutton-
chops, when the Chancellor and Judges always partook of them. In i-
later years the system of refreshing led to so much boisterous
revelry, that a fee was given to the counsel to enable them to call for
what they liked, and the dinners at the Old Bailey were the last
remnant of the objectionable system. Bribing a minister is now very
unusual, though once a common offence; and the bonus offered to a
PREMIER for a snug place no doubt gave rise to the word premium.
In these days, any one attempting to offer a bribe at the Treasury,
would receive in his ear one of those industrious fleas which are
educated expressly for the purpose. Bribery at elections has been
repressed in theory by numerous Acts of Parliament; while the acts
of the members themselves, before their election, have generally
encouraged it. Several laws have made all sorts of wholesome pro-
visions against bribery and treating; but the parties have usually
considered beer and spirits, with plenty to eat as well as to drink,
much more wholesome provisions than any that an Act of Parlia-
ment could offer them.
Barck. An article too dry to be admitted into our Political
Dictionary, if it had not been a subject for taxation, and an illustra-
tion of the fact, that, though blood cannot be got out of a stone,
money may be extracted from a brick, as was the case when Pitt, in
1784, introduced that commodity into his Budget as a source of
revenue. The duty is imposed when the brick is in a wet state-
when, in fact, the clay is formed into a lump-so that the brick-
makers, however averse to the tax on the brick, are compelled to
like it when they have once lumped it. There is no duty on bricks
in Ireland, which arises, perhaps, from there being so few regular
bricks in that part of the Empire. There are a few resident land-
lords who behave like bricks, and take upon themselves the duty that
devolves upon them in that respectable character.

A Deep Groan.
Ma. Flight, of Walbrook, has promised to relieve his parish from
“the thraldom under which it has groaned for twenty years.” We have
heard of very deep-drawn sighs, that may have lasted beyond the usual
period allotted to a mortal yawn; but the groan of St. Stephen's, Wal-
brook, must be a very overgrown groan to have lasted for nearly a
quarter of a century.
A chAnce For the TUnnEL,
We understand the Thames Tunnel Company is ready to dispose
of its shaft. We should like to know what has become of all the shafts

yet be returned to the shareholders.

“Admit Two to The Boxes.”
33aílſoap ºutbeging.
Those unfortunate surveyors, who are compelled to commit tres-
passes on property that does not belong to them, for the purpose of
taking levels, are occasionally made to find their own by being sum-
marily ejected from the premises. A few days ago we found a gen-
tleman in our coal cellar calculating its facilities for a tunnel, and we
were alarmed in the middle of the night by the barking of our dog;
when, on going to see what was the matter, we found him with the leg of
an unfortunate engineer clasped in his teeth, while the clerk, who had
been assisting at the survey, had tried the practicability of a cutting, by
cutting away over the stable wall, and falling into the water-butt. We
beg leave to inform all the surveyors and engineers in England, that
our dog is let loose after dark, while spring guns and steel traps are set
in every part of our premises.
The necessity for taking the surveys at night, in consequence of the
liability of being warned off as trespassers, has suggested to the engineers
the following pathetic ballad:—
Meet me by moonlight alone,
And then I'll survey you a line,
Must be done by the moonlight alone;
For a trespass, you know, there's a fine.
Remember, be sure and be there,
For though daylight is best for the eyes,
The survey we can best prepare
When darkness detection defies.
Then meet me by moonlight alone.
PROSPECTS OF THE BRIDGES.
THE metropolitan bridges are certainly looking up. It seems that
Southwark and Waterloo have both got companies to take pity on their
solitary wretchedness; Hungerford, too, has got a wealthy partner for
life;—but not a railway comes gallantly forward to ask poor old West-
minster Bridge to be joined in the bonds of union. We are afraid the
old bridge is gradually getting lower in the world, and that Old Father
Thames only tolerates it so long as it keeps its head above water. There
is only one chance of the poor old creature not being left without a friend
in the world, and that is, if the members of Parliament should support it
out of consideration to their own convenience. In that case it will share
the celebrity in history of the far-famed “Pons AsinoRum.”
Desrorism In Russia.—The EMPERoR of Russia has banished into
Siberia a Professor of the University of Moscow, because he had pub-
lished a Book with the title of “The Revolution of the Stars.”
SHAKSPEARE.-4* MACBETH."
ILLUSTRATED BY MR. Twyford, of Bow STREET.
Macbeth. “The times have been,
That when the brains were out, the man would die,
And there an end ; but now they rise again.
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,” &c., &c.
So said Macbeth, and he is confirmed in his assertion by MR. Twyford,
as will appear by the following circumstance reported in the newspapers
of Saturday, the 1st Nov. :—
“Bow STREET, BEFone MR. Twyford.—John Augos was charged with assaulting
— KENNIs... The Defendant was fined £5. The parties resided in the same house.
The Complainant implored his Worship to protect him from the future violence of the
Defendant. MR. Twyford said he could do nothing further at the present. The
Complainant—“But supposing he was to come and murder me to-night, your Worship?’
MR. Twyford—“You Must coxie AND G8T A summons.’” I ll
Isegal Intelligence.
MR. SMITH is not to have a silk gown, but he has purchased one for
his wife, which perhaps gave rise to the rumour. It is whispered that
MR. BRIEFLess intends giving up the Rolls, where he has never been able
to get his bread, and will try the Queen's Bench for the present. His
speech, on applying for the rule to compute in Shelly's case, is not to be
printed ; but some of his MS. notes are in the hands of a celebrated
Bibliopole, who is said to have advanced money upon them.
The Usher of the Queen's Bench has been remaining at his seat, close
to the witness-box. He entertained all the Judges of the Court, by
crying out “Pray, silence 1” in the wrong place on several occasions. It
is believed that the chief objection to the Court's being removed to
Lincoln's Inn, arises from the impracticability of moving some of the
very heavy Chancery suits; but Pickfond & Co. have expressed their
readiness to attempt the Herculean undertaking.
OUR INDIAN CORRESPONDENCE.
THE Army has succumbed, and RUNJEET Singh's grandmother ascends
the Punjaub, with the title of Provisional Begum of the Grand Duchy of
Tartary. The Divan is under
a cloud, probably on account of
that immense cigar, BEN Bolin,
who is fuming with vengeance.
The Sheikh had fallen sick at
Alicampane, and was not ex-
pected to rise for the present.
His maternal aunt has promised
to aid him ; but the perfidious
woman is said to be in league
with RUNJEET SINGH, who has
given himself up to the wildest
excesses, drinking gallons of
Carrara water and eating the
shells of the delicious cocoa-nut
with extravagant recklessness.
Should the Sheikh rally, the contest must be fearful; but the British
Resident has received instructions to look on with his arms folded as
long as possible. If a blow is aimed at him, he is to demand his passport,
and retire to the frontier to await further orders.

invasions of England.
The Napoleon Column, at Boulogne, has just been completed, after
upwards of thirty years' labour. The completion of it has lately been
deferred out of compliment to the PRINCE de Joinville, who felt rather
scrupulous about a monument being finished in honour of an invasion
that had never taken place. His consent, however, was at last gained by
the promise that a similar column should be erected opposite Brighton, to
commemorate a visit the warlike PRINce paid there a short time back.
The sh Are MARKET.
The Grand Northern and Eastern Clothes-Line did not move a peg all
the morning, and Great Trunks, which opened well, closed heavily. A
juvenile Stag, whose scrip was at ; discount, cried out piteously for his
par, but got no attention.
ASSociation OF IDEAS.
A Stag, dining near Capel Court, made a strange mistake the other
day, which only proves that whatever is uppermost in the mind is sure to
come out. He wanted some potatoes; but unwittingly cried out, “Here,
MARY, bring me a plate of mashed railways.”

Among other curiosities of Railway Literature that have been
forwarded to us for review, is a Prospectus of a Ship Railway, the
business purpose of which is announced to be—
“To convey laden ships, overland, between the North and Irish Seas, and
to and from the commercial and manufacturing towns of Lancashire, Yorkshire,
Durham, Cheshire, Staffordshire, and Warwickshire.”
We can fancy a ship, heavily laden, sailing majestically up the
High Street of York, or over the little bridge of Durham : talk of
a fish out of water;-the animal would be quite at home compared
with the man-of-war removed from its usual element. One of the
great steam Leviathans of the deep would look very like a whale
if it were found taking a promenade along the busy thoroughfares
of one of the manufacturing towns in the North of England. If
ships are to be taken overland, the sea will become a superfluity,
and a Company to bottle it off may be formed immediately.
“The unquestionable practicability of the scheme,” says the Pro-
spectus, “will be vouched by an eminent engineer;” and web.ave
no doubt that “eminent engineers” will be found in abundance to
vouch for the practicability of anything. Perhaps they would
vouch for the practicability of crossing the Line, by making a Rail-
way line of it, and using it for the transfer of goods and passen
from one end of the Equator to the other. -
Honse
THE EASTERN PASSAGE.
WE understand that LIEUTENANT WAGHoRN has been commissioned by
the Government to try the experiment of shortening the passage over-
land from the West End to the City. This gentleman's well-known
energy in overcoming the most frightful obstacles will be of great service
in contending with those fearful barriers that now prevent a free
communication between the different parts of the metropolis. The
Lieutenant will start from the Post Office, traverse the heights of
Pentonville, continuing his journey northward till he reaches the New
Road, when he will make for the West End. The regular mail will go
by the old route, which it is expected will prove longer, on account of the
stoppages, than the circuitous journey undertaken by LIEUTENANT
WAghorn. Europe is on tiptoe to watch the result, and America is
trying to get a peep over Europe's shoulder at the important struggle.
An Odd Fancy.
In the Times of Friday, there is an advertisement for an active young
woman who, among other qualifications, “understands bright stoves.”
She must be a very intelligent person to be able to have an understanding
with a bright stove; for if we were to study such an article for a month,
we should not succeed in establishing a sort of sympathy between our-
selves and the fire-place. We presume, however, that this kind of
understanding is perfectly practicable, and we think it very possible that
the expression, “ §. in stones,” must be a misprint for “Sermons
in stoves,” which SHAkspeaRE probably thought of, and which also
occurred to the person advertising for a housemaid who understands
them when in a state of brightness.
POTATOES AND PEEL.
THE weather, which has damaged the potatoes, has also broken up the
PREMIER's slide; which is now decidedly, to be marked “Dangerous.”
If he will still persist, in spite of the warnings of the Free Traders, in
venturing upon it, we tremble for his safety: we shall soon have all the
political naughty boys shouting at the “cove in the hice.” Under these
circumstances, we earnestly recommend the formation of a Ministerial
Humane Society, with a view to rescue him from the consequences of his
recklessness. Surely the Conservatives, who furnish so many drags upon
legislation, could .# a drag to help their leader at his need: the Landed
Interest, should he sacrifice himself on its behalf, cannot do less than try
to get him out of the water. Let the landlords and farmers, then, com-
bine for this benevolent object, and save him by hook or by crook; though
by what hook or by what crook they will be able to save him, should he
get into the scrape apprehended, is more than we can tell.
PEEL's “POSES PLASTIQUES.”
WE understand that PROFEssoR KELLER intends to vary his Poses
Plastiques with specimens taken from political life. He has been studying
the history of SIR. Robert PEEL lately, for the purpose of making a
collection of the different attitudes he has assumed upon every popular
question. The series will be very entertaining to those who are fond of
rapid changes, and invaluable to young politicians.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 219
THE NEW M.P. FOR WINDSOR.
ºs HEN a Parliamentary candidate
(, ) talks about our “glorious Con-
- | stitution in Church and State”
—when, slapping his waistcoat,
he furthermore talks of “ve-
nerable institutions,” and ends
in a paroxysm, with “the great
bulwarks of the constitution,”
—we know exactly the sort of
Member we are to expect. He
will wear M.P. about him, like
a pink in his button-hole, as
something pretty. He will be
one of those Members whose
best virtue is their dumbness—a goose that has the sagacity not to
gaggle upon all occasions. i
Now Colon EL REID, the new military Member for Windsor, we
take to be a senator of this kind; a bird of this feather. He calls
himself one of the devoted “to the Church ;” of course, he meant
to the Church Militant, seeing that his own soldiers mixed among
the crowd, and no doubt, in defence of our venerable institutions,
brutally attacked all opposed to their Commander. The interests of
the Protestant Church are, of course, never so gloriously supported
as by a mob of drunken soldiery. Lawn sleeves never look so
beautiful as when contrasted by red coats; the canteen is the proper
chapel of ease to the Established Church. Colon EL REID pro-
claimed himself a Conservative, and his soldiers illustrated the
meaning of their Commander by breaking the people's heads.
“Magna reverentia debetur pueris,” says the Roman ; and Colon EL
REID manifested his reverence to youth, by contriving to have a
crowd of Eton boys in the Town Hall to hold up their infant hands
in his favour on his nomination. Considering what the Colonel owes
to these tender juveniles—truants from school to manufacture an
M.P.-he might intertwine whatever laurels he may have with the
birch; for certainly the Eton boys helped to make him M.P. for
Windsor: he is almost as much a thing of their hands as their
previous GUY FAwkEs of the Fifth : that also, like the Member,
being made to indicate a devotion to our venerable institutions.
However, let us give Colon EL REID his due. When elected, he
was not immediately ungrateful to his makers. Certainly not;
for-
“Between 200 and 300 of them [Eton boys], in groups of from 40 to 50 in each,
wearing red and white rosettes in their breasts, returned into Windsor shortly after
4 o'clock, shouting “Reid for ever,” and ‘showing fight," in several instances, to those
they met wearing the colours of MR. WALTER,”
Being roughly handled, some forty or fifty of the boys made their
way to the cavalry barracks at Spital, where the Colonel, with the
new bloom of M.P. upon him, had arrived.
“The boys were so plentifully supplied with champagne, that by the time they left
: §§ many appeared scarcely to know whether they "stood on their heads or their
eels.
This is the prettiest part of the business. Imagine the new-made
senator–the champion of our venerable institutions — the new
buttress to the bulwarks of our constitution—the affectionate son of
the Protestant Church, so far illustrating his devotion as a patriot,
and his meekness as a Christian, as to hob and nob champagne with
fifty school-boys in token of their mutual triumph. There is some-
thing so affecting, yet withal, so pretty in the scene, that we would
have it immortalised in a picture for the mess-room of the barracks
of Spital.
Nevertheless, our loyalty is a little scandalised, that in the town of
Windsor—with Windsor Castle in it, like the town's heart—there
should be this vulgar tumult. We had hoped better things from
the benign influence of good example. Shall the proverb henceforth
run—“the nearer the Palace, the further from good manners”?
It has been more than intimated by the losing party that Colon El
REID owes his election not to back-stairs power at the Castle, but to
kitchen-stairs influence. It is openly avowed that the gallant Colonel
has been seen sniffing down the area for votes; that he is, therefore,
indebted for his seat to thorough-going turnspits, and enthusiastic
scullions; and that the people of Windsor, in electing the noble
soldier, have only practically carried out a frequent advertisement,
and “given the best price for kitchen-stuff.”
PROVISIONAL PROSPECTUS
OF THE GRAND TRUNK DISTRIBUTION AND GENERAL LUGGAGE
ALLOTMENT,
* t
In Connection WITH ALL THE existing RAILWAYs.
Capital 10,000 Portmanteaus, with a further stock of 20,000 Carpet Bags,
and a reserve fund of Dressing Cases, Desks, small Parcels,
and Hat Bores.
IN consequence of the spirit of enterprise that has been shown in
realising a bonus, by boning the luggage at the termini of the various
Railways, the present Company has been formed to introduce some-
thing like system into what has hitherto been a mere scramble of the
most indiscriminate nature. It has been calculated that several
hundreds of Portmanteaus, Carpet Bags, &c., &c., change hands in the
course of every week on the arrival of the trains, and it is considered
fair that instead of a few profiting by the present system of luggage
allotment, the advantages ought to be accessible to the public in
general.
With this view it is proposed that every Railway passenger should
be expected, as he is now, to pay down at once a deposit of the
whole of his luggage, for which a number will be given, and the lug-
gage being all jumbled together, he shall receive at the end of his
journey such articles as may fall to his lot in the course of the dis-
tribution, which will be conducted on the principle of one package
to each person in the order in which they come, till the whole
capital is disposed of. It is believed that this will be hailed by the
public as a considerable improvement on the present plan of indis-
criminate claiming and snatching, by which the individual with
the loudest voice and readiest hand often gets an undue share of
the stock of luggage.
Persons paying a large deposit of Bank Notes or Jewellery in
small cases, will be entitled to a double allotment, if the value of the
deposit is proved at the time of receiving the scrip, or number, which
will be the only evidence of their being actually Shareholders.
Further particulars to be had of the porters at the Railways,
who will act as the Allotting Committee—receiving one package in
ten as their profit, instead of taking all they can conveniently get
hold of.

The demand for iron for the Railroads is being sensibly felt in the
feverish state of saucepans, which have risen to an alarming height within
the last few weeks. A good tea-kettle, which was quoted in the New Cut
as low as ninepence, a month ago, has rushed up to a shilling without the
coupon, that is to say, with no lid to it. The buoyancy in gridirons has
been quite frightful; for their resemblance to Railway lines has made
them the object of competition among various companies. Pokers were
dreadfully firm, without the smallest probability of their yielding; and
there being no chance of their giving way, there was a good deal of
activity. With the exception, however, of pokers, there was very little
stirring; for irons were flat, and people seemed afraid of burning their
fingers. A little was done in frying-pans at the beginning of the day,
but there was no disposition to play for a very great stake, as there for-
merly used to be.

PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
|
BRIEF (In Law). A complicated account of a simple transaction,
which enables Counsel to mystify himself and everybody else about
an ordinary matter. Drawing a brief is
- the art of covering as much paper as
possible with the smallest quantity of
material ; and resembles the ingenious
contrivance of Dido, who cut a bull's
hide into strips on being assigned as
much land as she could enclose with the
hide of that animal. Thus, in drawing a
brief, facts are cut up into shreds and
patches, or torn to ribbons, for the pur-
pose of rendering them so roundabout
as to cover as much space of paper as
possible.
Budget. The annual financial state-
ment of the CHANcellon of THE Ex-
cHEquER, which is called a Budget,
because the Ministers must Budge if
they cannot carry their measure. Some
etymologists derive the word Budget
from the old French word bougette, a bag;
and it is probable that in the days of
corruption the Minister bagged a con-
siderable amount of the budget. Shaks-
PEARE speaks of a “sow-skin budget,”
which would seem to indicate that the
public money had been formerly kept in
a sow's ear, before silk purses came into
fashion.
Bullion. Uncoined gold and silver;
which is supposed to be kept in the Bank
parlour, and comprises, no doubt, the
plate laid out upon the Bank sideboard.
When we last looked in at the window
of the Bank parlour, we saw several
spoons, all very fiddle-headed, sitting
round the table, and who turned out
not to be pure bullion, but a species of
human specie. Any person may demand
notes in exchange for gold bullion, and I
may insist on having my watch or any
other article melted down for me, if I
wish to make myself troublesome to the
Bank of England. I must, however,
take advantage of the melting moments
of the Bank, if I wish to be attended to,
for I have no right to insist on having
my watch put on by itself to simmer
down, when the Bank kitchen fire may
be otherwise occupied.
Bulls, PAPAL, are letters issued by the
Pope, and are probably called Bulls in
England on account of their being very
great mistakes in this country, where they
are treated with the utmost contempt by
all classes. Some think that a Bull derives
its name from its being an attempt to
bully the community. Queen Eliza-
BETH literally took the bull by the horns, and, crumpling it up as
a bit of waste paper, passed an Act,
declaring it high treason to procure,
publish, or use a Papal Bull in this
country. The most remarkable Bull
is that approved' by the Diet of the
Germanic empire in 1356; such bulls
being, however altogether repugnant
to our notions of diet, for we are quite
unable to stomach them.
CABINET. A common appellation
! for the Ministry, and supposed to be
i derived from the word cabin, because º
of the number of snug berths to be
found in it. The Administration con-
sists of only five or six principal officers,
but some distinguished persons not
the cabinet.
holding office are sometimes requested to walk in and take a seat
in the Cabinet.
CAcHET, LETTRE DE. An instrument of tyranny formerly used
in France, which we are happily not able to translate into English.
Luckily the English dramatists of that day were not so fond of
taking from the French, or they would have given an adaptation
of the Lettre de Cachet to the English public, along with some of the
other atrocious inflictions with which they have visited their country.
Lettres de Cachet were openly bought and sold before the French
Revolution, like railway letters of allotment before the panic or
reign of terror in the share market.
PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION.
Wisdom, it must be confessed, goes but at a slow pace round
about the world; nevertheless, she does make progress: and from
time to time, it is a cheering thing to hear of her doings in some
almost forgotten corner of the universe. The philanthropist raises
his hands, and renders hearty thanks when he hears of her benign
influence among any part of the human family. It appears by “a
letter from Copenhagen of the 23rd ult, that in Denmark for several
centuries” culprits have had their heads cut off with an axe. The
block “was hollowed out in such a manner, that the whole of the
face was introduced into the cavity.” Well, for several centuries,
it seems, the government officer with the hatchet was liable to
“accidents.” His hand was not sure, or his heart was not suffi-
ciently strong to permit him to do his work handsomely: he was
apt to maim and torture his victims, “especially in 1843 and 1844.”
At length, “after several centuries,” a wise, paternal government
has taken these things to heart, and, touched by benevolence, elevated
by wisdom, has resolved to abolish the hatchet and the block; and,
in their stead, to “adopt the guillotine.” This, “after several cen-
turies,” is no doubt a great move in the onward progress of human
improvement. And whereas the wretched sinner of 1843 and 1844
was maimed and chopped by only one headsman,—the malefactor of
1845 is to have “two executioners 1” The march of intellect is,
certainly, not slow in Denmark, seeing that in only several centuries,
it has absolutely moved from the block to the guillotine.
A PROMISING SPECULATION.
It is rumoured that a Company is in the course of formation, to lease
the contents of LoRd Ashley's waste-paper basket, at a rental of so much
per annum. The enormous number of persons who make Load AshLEY
the medium of subscribing large sums to benevolent purposes, added to
his Lordship's habit of throwing down his letters unread, must render his
waste-paper basket one of the most profitable as well as the safest invest-
ments of the present day. Supposing that only two hundred-pound-notes
find their way into this receptacle for his Lordship's correspondence in
the course of a week, there will be an income of upwards of one hundred
thousand pounds per annum. Several of the waste-paper dealers have
promised to join the Direction, and an influential Provisional Committee
will be forthwith advertised.
Sportsman's Arithmetic.
We often read paragraphs setting forth, in the gravest manner, the
incredible number of pounds of soune enormous fish, or bird, or animal,
that has been killed by some noble sportsman. As our readers may
wonder that these monster-fish and birds are not more plentiful, and that
they are never seen or heard of excepting in print, we assure them that
it is all a matter of arithmetic. First, the exact number of pounds of the
salmon, or pheasant, or pig, or whatever it may be, is ascertained, and
then this amount is multiplied by two. The account is next sent to a
country paper, and invariably by the time the salmon or the &c.
gets into print, it weighs three times heavier than when it was first
caught. In this way the largest birds are brought down; and the
instrument, which never misses, is the “Ready Reckoner.”
DREADFUL Accident in THE FOG.
A GENTLEMAN, who wanted to go to the Mendicity Society, mistook his
way, and entered, unknowingly, the British and Foreign Destitute. The
poor gentleman did not find out his mistake till he had put his name
down as a life subscriber. It is impossible to calculate the consequences
of this dreadful accident. We regret to say that the gentleman's case is
so desperate, that he has been given up by his friends.

FLEET STREET REDIVIVUS.
FLEET STREET is itself again. The cabs enjoy their daily promenade
once more, and saunter along as leisurely as if they were monarchs of all
they surveyed. The omnibuses, also, walk over the course, and adver-
tising carts revolve on their orbits as slowly as they can, so that those
“who run, may read.” The City turnpikeman is at his lamp-post again
at the corner of Chancery Lane. He chases carts with an ardour which
goes far to prove that his mind, to say nothing of his legs, has gained
considerably in elasticity during the late long vacation. The duties of
this industrious official are enormous. We have frequently watched
him running the whole length of Fleet Street in pursuit of an evading
twopence, and have trembled lest, in the ardour of the chase, he should
tumble into one of the precipitous ravines that have skirted, for weeks, the
margin of the common sewer. The Trustees of the City Tolls should in
mercy provide him with a horse, or, at least, a velocipede. Perhaps the
shorter way, however, would be to abolish the toll altogether. In that
case, the indefatigable turnpikeman will be entitled to compensation;
and, if there is such a thing as justice in the City, it should not be a
penny less than what was given to the Six Clerks.

* AND THE DEAR Children : *
“Why, Alexandrina Victoria is a good deal BETTER ; but DEAR little
ALBERT HERE is still very delicath.”
TO THE HUMANE.-HARD CASE.
THE present Appeal to the kind-hearted public is made by the friends
of a decayed gentleman, who has seen better days. The Applicant, MR.
DAN, was formerly in affluent circumstances, but was unfortunately in-
duced to connect himself with a speculation called Repeal; the utter
failure of which has brought him into his present difficulties. MR. D.
has lately been deriving a precarious subsistence from an income of only
twenty thousand pounds a year ! chiefly given by the poorest of the Irish
peasantry; but the failure of the potato crop will lessen even this small
pittance. The Applicant is now reduced to travel with four horses, and
can afford to entertain no more than thirty persons every day at his public
table ; and though his friends in Ireland now and then give him a meal,
yet it must be evident to any gentleman that, to keep a pack of harriers,
to maintain three establishments, and the expense of making his affecting
case known through the newspapers, must make him even more dependent
than formerly on the charity of the public.
As to his character, MR. D. begs to refer to his old friends, Whig
& Co.; also to the gaoler at the Penitentiary, and the Times’ Commis-
sioner; by whom the smallest donations will be thankfully received for
him; as also by
J. TuAM, Esq. — SoBRIEN, Esq.

DEATH IN THE THAMES NAVY.
WE are extremely sorry to have to record the fact, that Waterman
No. 7, familiarly known as the jolly middle-aged waterman in the Thames
fleet, is no more. It came in collision with a Bee, and the sting it
received from the concussion was too much for the very sensitive craft.
Its eyes or windows filled with water, its funnel gave one deep groan, and
it sunk into untimely mud off London Bridge. The Bee was a relation by
the side of its Ant; and the Bee was so much affected, that it nearly
sunk into the same grave as the Waterman, for they were locked in each
other's paddle-boxes for a considerable time. The Waterman was ex-
ceedingly well, connected, and several noble steam-boats are placed in
mourning by the sad event. The Lily and Pink will both have to go into
black on account of the melancholy affair.
THE MAN IN THE MOON.

I have look’d upon Earth below;
And have watch'd the tides of the ocean wave
With her changes ebb and flow.
All things, beside, that the moon obey,
It has been my sport to see ;
The whirligig brains, and the wits that stray,
When aloft at the full rides she.
Babel of old, when they rear'd its tower,
I beheld from my starry home,
And at NERo I laugh'd, in his frenzied hour,
As he fiddled o'er burning Rome.

How I roar'd at the deeds of knightly worth
Of the madmen his sermons made

And the game they have been to me !
The drollest, methought, of its Bedlam dreams
Was the bubble of famed South Sea.
Little thought I there would e'er befal
Again such a scene of mirth;
But the Railway Bubble passes all
I have seen on the crazy Earth.
Ne'er were such days since first Time was
begun;
Oh, John Bull is a rich buffoon :
Ho, ho, what rare frolic | Ho, ho, what fine
fun
Are in store for the ‘Man in the Moon”!”
DRESSING FOR COURT.
A DAY or two since, one Higgins, a tailor, sued a gentleman named
WEBSTER (not the immortal BENJAMIN of the Haymarket), for 15l., the
price of a dressing-gown; a thing, as defendant pleaded, mis-cut, mis-
made, mis-fitting. Three tailors gave their solemn testimony against the
garment. But this was not enough. The defendant, with a moral courage
that ought to immortalise him among the statues for Parliament, donned
the gown in full court; whereupon he was immediately shampooed by the
three tailors, in order to prove that the gown was too long and too short,
too wide and too narrow. And they did prove all these things. Never-
theless, though the aforesaid Webster looked a Noodle, Justice, with her
proverbial blindness, would not see it ; so returned a verdict for HIGGINs,
thereby declaring that when the tailor made for the defendant he made the
best of a bad bargain. It may be supposed that Higgins went off with
his goose in full feather. Still have we a great respect for the moral
daring of WEBSTER. Again, we admire his luck; for how seldom has a
man, once stripped in a court of law, ever had a coat to his back afterwards!
A Railway Isullaby.
The fearful lull in the Share Market has given rise to the following
Lullaby, which is now being .."; by the Stags of Capel Court, as they
pace the deserted purlieus of the Stock Exchange:–
Hush-a-by, broker, at Capel Court top,
When the wind's raised the premiums will stop;
When there's a breeze the premiums will fall—
Down come the holders, the brokers, and all.
SERVE THEM RIGHT!
THE little Eton boys, who made such a riot at Windsor after the elec-
tion, have been severely punished. Their straps have been taken away
from them, and the ringleaders have been put on “skyblue” till they
have learnt Colonel REID's address to the electors by heart. Sooner
than submit to this, we regret to say that three boys with promising
indications of whiskers have deserted.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A BIRTH-DAY PRESENT.
ositively there is no sentiment more ingenious
than the sentiment of loyalty. Like love, “it will
find out the way” to make itself known to its
adored object. Hence, do we read of ancient
village dames sending kittens to the Queen—and
of male old women forwarding all sorts of knick-
knacks to baby-royalty. Within these few days,
however, Ma. Anson, “of the Household,” has
distanced all givers by the peculiar oddity of his
donation to the PRINCE of WALEs. A fox-hunt
took place at Windsor on the PRINCE's birth-day.
The fox was killed.
“The brush was secured by Mr. Tilbury, who was the
first up at the finish. At the request of MR. Anson, the ‘fox-
hunter's trophy' was given up by Mr. Tilbury, MR. Anson
expressing his wish to present it to the PR1xce of Walks as
a birth-day present.”
We really cannot see anything in the PRINCE
of WALEs and a fox's brush, that, as a birth-day present, they should be
thus put together. What possible use can the brush be to his Royal
Highness? Now, had it been a hare-hunt, we could have understood the
delicate attention of Anson had he presented the creature's tail, seeing
that it would have made his Royal Highness a very excellent powder-puff.
But a fox's tail I What has the leonine quality of true royalty to do
with such an appendage? Unless, indeed, Anson would subtly recom-
mend an adoption of the old saying, “to piece out the lion's skin with
a bit of the fox.”
PUNCH AND GIBBS IN THE EXCHEQUER.
On the 10th of November, 1845, Sol rose with a very red face;
the BARons of THE Exchequen put on their very red robes, and
everything seemed to blush for GIBBs, who was expected to come
into Court to give an account of his Mayoralty. Such an unusual
circumstance as GIBBs furnishing an account had attracted a very
large audience, and the Court of Exchequer was crowded to the
clock-case with Learning, Beauty, Fashion, and Brieflessness. A
galaxy of British loveliness clustered in the jury-box, and the
venerable Usher, surrounded by a large circle of miscellaneous
friends, clung to the dais usually devoted to the witnesses.
MR. BRIEFLEss had just commenced an impassioned appeal to the
Court against that hardened villain, the Casual Ejector. The learned
enthusiast was in the act of scorching the casual villain with the
lightning of his eloquence, and praying the judgment of the Court on
his devoted head, with the passionate ardour of a MIRABEAu.
“Shall it be said,” cried BaleFLEss, “that a mere casual ejector, a
thing of chance, the very accident of an accident ?” He was
going on in this inspired strain, when the Usher whispered to JUDGE
PARKE, who rose precipitately from his seat, followed by his learned
brethren, Pollock, ALDERson, and PLATT, leaving Ma. BRIEFLEss
in the act of calling down a volley of curses on the head of that
ejector who could coolly and casually keep the plaintiff out of pos-
session of his own property. A movement among the auditory—a
general shrinking back—announced the approach of GIBBs and the
rest of the civic procession.
The Judges had by this time resumed their seats, and the citizens
made their appearance. When they had all got into their places,
the new Lond MAYon was missing. He had got lost, like a needle
in a bottle of hay, among the crowd of spectators. Fortunately the
feather in his hat served as a signal to point him out to the REMEM-
BRANCER, who dived in, or ducked down, after him among the crowd,
and brought him up safely to the place designed for him. As soon
as they had all got into their places, the REcoRDER spoke nearly to
the following effect:-
“My Loans, I have the pleasure of introducing to you MR.
Johnson (query LoRD Johnson), the individual who, &c. &c. &c.
free choice of his fellow-citizens. Ma. Johnson built the Plymouth
Breakwater. Having commenced building, he turned his thoughts
to architecture, and became the architect of his own fortunes.” (Sub-
dued whispers of “Bravo, Johnson 1") As to the late Load Mayon
(a laugh), he retires into private life, amid the joy of his fellow-
* (Aside from the Usher: “They're glad to get rid of him, I dare
say.”
Sin Faenearck Pollock then made the following pithy reply:—
“My Lond MAYon, you have had the honour, &c. &c. &c., fellow-
citizens. You have had some connection with the Plymouth Break-
water. You have been the architect of your own fortunes, and I
am very happy to hear it. As to you, my late Lord MAYon, you go
into comparatively private life; and I am sure your fellow-citizens
must feel very much obliged to you.”
At the end of this speech, a formal demand was made to GIBBs to
bring in his accounts. One universal titter ran through the audience
at these words, and it was expected GIBEs would have given a flat
refusal. He, however, only stood mute, until BARoN ALDERson
administered an oath, winding up with the most impressive words,
delivered by the worthy Baron with a most searching glance at
Grebs, and an accent of sorrow rather than anger. The words in
question were—“Michael Gibbs, deliver your accounts as a good
accountant ought to do.” Then somebody read a warrant of
attorney, putting CHARLEs PEARson, Esq., in GLBBs's place—an
announcement which excited the strongest sympathy in the Court
for the devoted PEARson. The REcond ER then asked their Lord-
ships to dine with the Lond MAYon, who ought to have given the
verbal invitation himself; but nervousness caused the dinner to
stick in his throat when he was about to mention it. The CHIEF
BARoN remarked with cold dignity, “Some of their Lordships will
dine with the Lond MAYon;” and it was thought that his stress
on the word “some” meant to imply, “You don't catch me, if I can
possibly avoid it.”
The civic party having been bowed out amid general tittering, the
Court resumed its former dignity.
CAP E L COURT.
(suggested by ALFRED TENNyson's, “LockstEY HALL.”)
CoMRADEs, go and get your dinners, there's an eating-house at hand;
Leave me here, and when you want me, you will find me in the Strand;
'Tis the place, and all around it seems with recollection fraught;
Dreary kites are flying round me, as I stand in Capel Court.
Capel Court, that in its precincts overlooks the herd of Stags,
And the crowd of speculators, dressed in little more than rags:
Many a day I read the paper, ere I had retired to rest,
And it spoke of lots of railways, north to south and east to west.
Many a night I saw the prices, with the profits that were made;
Five, and six, and seven premium upon shares with two pounds paid.
Here about the Court I wandered, nourishing a hope sublime,
I might get a large allotment, if I only wrote in time.
The prospectuses before me many a splendid scheme proposed,
And at once I wrote before the list of applications closed.
When I dipt into my pocket, my resources just to see, -
All was blank, my purse was empty, empty as a purse could be ;
And I said, “My worthy broker, speak, and speak the truth, I pray,
On my letters of allotment will you the deposit pay tº
On his cheek there came a colour, every feature growing bright,
And I thought, “He’s flush of money, everything will now be right."
Then he turn'd—his check-book shaking, as he points,with winks and becks,
To the balance in his favour on the margin of the checks;
Saying, “I have lots of credit, with my banker I am strong "
Saying, “Bring me your allotments: I will pay them, right or wrong.”
Hope took up the pen in time, and wielding it with eager hands,
Fifty shares in every railway resolutely he demands.
Hope took up the Stagging line, and at it went with all his might;
Writing, writing for allotments, morning, evening, noon, and night.
Many a morning, at his lodging, did he hear the top-bell ring,
Hoping it might be the postman, who some shares had come to bring.
Many a morning, in the City, did we go and get the scrips,
And the profit shared together when we sold the precious slips.
Oh, my broker, chicken-hearted Oh, my broker, mine no more 1
Oh, the horrid, horrid panic l What a-what a dreadful bore 1
+ + + -- + + +
Oh! I see the crescent promise of my profit hath not set,
Ancient lines are at a premium, I may make a fortune yet.
However these things be, a long farewell to Capel Court;
I must cut before the settling, since for the account I’ve bought,
Comes a bubble from the distance, blackening with the city's smoke:
When it bursts, to those beneath it 'twill not be at all a joke.
Let it fall on Capel Court, in cold water let it drizzle ;
I've a long account to settle—which I can't-and so I mizzle.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
M. E. M. S. on L. O. R D M A Y O R'S DAY.
N truth the present Loan Mayor may exclaim, with Titus,
“I have lost a day!” for Lord Mayor's day falling on
Sunday, the present Mayoralty only commenced on the
| 19th, and unkind Fate has cruelly choused the present
civic potentate out of twenty-four hours' dignity; hence
it is, that Johnson may join Titus in his celebrated
exclamation; so that Titus will go down to º
Johnson in his hand, or rather, as Titus has eady
started on the road, Johnson, if he wishes to overtake
him, must hire a special train.
From an early hour on the 10th, the popular rejoicing
was manifested by the ringing of bells; though, by the way,
if this sort of thing is joyous, what a delightful companion
a General Postman must be, when he is going his rounds.
We shall omit the little details of getting Johnson up in
time, and having him properly rigged out for the im-
portant part he was about to play. The general opinion
was, that his Civic Majesty looked as neat as a new pin-a
simile probably
suggested by the
average amount of
head apportioned
to the Chief Magis-
trates of London,
in general.
It would be tedi-
ous to give a copi-
ous account of the
procession, which consisted of
the usual motley assemblage:
there were several banners em-
blazoned with arms, but we
could not exactly see the de-
vices, though some of the de-
vices of the late Lord Mayor
were said to be very remarkable.
There was our old friend, the
Ancient Herald, in his suit of
polished steel, looking as bright
as a set of fire-irons; his body
aiming at the stiffness of the
poker, but his legs dangling down
on either side of his steed with
the laxity of the tongs. There
was also our other old friend,
the other Ancient Knight, richly
caparisoned in brass, and look-
ing like a pile of animated coal-
scuttles, as he moved slowly
along in the middle of the cortège.
We understand that the utmost
difficulty was experienced in lift-
ing him into his saddle, in conse-
quence of the immense accumu-
lation of brass under the Gibbs
Mayoralty, which rendered it
necessary to hoist the Knight
into his seat on horseback by
means of a powerful crane.
In one of the carriages, the
party of four who occupied it
were passing the time in a game
at cards; and if Gibbs had been
one of the party, we should have
said that Cribbage was the amuse-
ment they were indulging in. The
LoRD Mayor was attended in his
carriage by the Common Crier,
who began to cry out uncom-
monly, when an accident hap-
pened to the state-carriage by
the wheel coming into collision
with a post on leaving Guildhall.
The river passage was performed without any of the casualties some-
times attendant on the Cockney navigation of the Thames; and the
Loan Mayor was ushered—by the regular Ushers—into the Court of
Exchequer; of his visit to which tribunal we have given an account
elsewhere.
Good News for our Colonel.—The first clod of the TreatWalley Rail-
way was turned, the other day, by Sir Robert PEEL. Colonel SIBTHoRP,
no doubt, will be glad to hear that the PREMIER has had a dig at a railway.
THE CITY KNIGHT.-A ROMAUNT.
“Oh, tell me true, Sir Knight, Sir Knight,
Exactly how you feel,
When buckled up so tight, so tight,
In all that polish'd steel !”
“To say the truth, my son, my son,
I’m in a perfect sop;
I feel the perspiration run
From my head like a mop.”
“But tell me why, my man, my man,
You don't at once say may
To this extremely cruel plan,
On every Lord Mayor's Day.”
“To tell the truth, my boy, my boy,
I regularly clear,
When thus my time I can employ,
A sovereign and my beer!”
“Impossible, Sir Knight, Sir Knight,
That you can care for pay,
Save the rich booty gain'd by right
In battle's proud array.”
“You’re very green, young chap, young chap ;
The truth you now may learn :
I am not worth a single rap,
Excepting what I earn.”
“I understand, old Guy, old Guy—
I see the mystery now ;
You get your daily living by
The sweating of your brow.”
“Oh, if I did, young gent, young gent.,
My income would be higher,
If I got an equivalent
For all that I perspire.”
The trumpet sounds—the horse, the horse,
The signal shrewdly knows;
Onwards he moves, with him, of course,
The Knight in Armour goes.
Seta-ſºlater for the ſºlillion.
Though the earth has bubbles, it must not be forgotten that the water
also hath; a fact that has been recently illustrated by a grand scheme
lately proposed for establishing a company to bring up the sea-water from
Brighton by means of a pipe lying by the side of the London and
Brighton Railway. The only difficulty is to know what to do with the
water when it arrives at London Bridge; for it will be impossible to take
it away in buckets to the people who want a sea-water bath, and therefore
the only thing to be done with the water when it gets to town will be to
send it all back again. This, it is suggested, will be rather an advantage
than otherwise, for it will, of course, double the traffic. It is calculated
that if the London public should patronise the scheme, and take the water,
there would be nearly a quarter of a pint per house available for distribu-
tion among the inhabitants of the metropolis. The prospectus in which
this scheme is put forth expresses surprise at its never having been
thought of before. We beg to inform the projectors that it has been
thought of before, so that there is nothing to excite surprise; neither will
it create astonishment, to hear that it has been given up before, as we
expect it again will be.
The First Man of the Day.
The next edition of the “Vestiges of Creation” will be dedicated to
the immortal Widotcomb, in grateful return for some new facts he has
communicated to the Author. They relate principally to the fact of the
moon at the Colosseum being a slice of the one he recollects when he was
Master of the Ceremonies at the Amphitheatre at Rome.
Factory CHILDREN.
By the present laws female children cannot be admitted to work in
factories until they are thirteen years of age, and the mode adopted of
ascertaining that age is the same as is used in discovering the age of
horses and donkeys. It is therefore suggested that a like mode of
examination should be applied for the admission of candidates for the
Bar, and that it should not be sufficient for the applicants to show that
they had “eaten their terms,” but that they had also “cut their wise
teeth.”

JEAMES’S DIARY.
MMAGIN when these unfortnat members of my famly
hentered the room : you may phansy theixtonnishment
of the nobil company presnt. Old Grann looked round
the room quite estounded by its horientle splender, and
huncle BILL (pulling hoff his phantail, & seluting the
company as respeckfly as his wulgar natur would alow)
says—“Crikey, JEAMEs, you’ve got a better birth here
than you ad where you were in the plush and powder
line.” “Try a few of them plovers hegs, sir, I says,
whishing, I’m asheamed to say, that somethink would
choke huncle B– ; “and I hope, mam, now you've
ad the kindniss to wisit me, a little refreshmint wontbe
out of your way.”
“This I said, detummind to put a good fase on
the matter; and because, in herly times, I’d reseaved
a great deal of kindniss from the hold lady, which I
should be a roag to forgit. She paid for my schooling;
she got up my fine linning gratis; shes given me many
& many alb; and manys the time in appy appy days
when me and MARYHANN has taken tea. But never mind that. ‘Mam,'
says I, ‘you must be tired hafter your walk."
“‘Walk? Nonsince, JEAMEs,’ says she “its Saturday, & I came in,
in the cart.” “Black or green tea, maam #' says Fitzwaanen, intarupting
her. And I will say the feller showed his nouce & good breeding in this
difficklt momink; for he'd halready silenced huncle Bill, whose mouth
was now full of muffinx, am, Blowny sausag, Perrigole pie, and other
dellixies.
“Wouldn't you like a little somethink in your tea, Mam.,’ says that
sly wagg CINQBARs. “He knows what I likes,' replies the hawfle hold
Lady, pinting to me, (which I knew it very well, having often seen her
take a glas of hojous gin along with her Bohee), and so I was ableeged
to horder FitzwańREN to bring round the lieures, and to help my unfor-
tint rellatif to a bumper of Ollands. She tost it hoff to the elth of the
company, giving a smack with her lipps after she'd emtied the glas, which
very nearly caused me to phaint with hagny. But, luckaly for me, She
didn't igspose herself much farther: for when CINQBARs was pressing her
to take another glas, I cried out, “Don’t, my lord,” on which old Grann
hearing him edressed by his title, cried out, “A Lord! o, law l’ and got
up and made him a cutsy, and coodnt be peswaded to speak another word.
The presents of the noble gent. heavidently made her uneezy.
“The Countiss on my right and had shownt symtms of ixtream disgust
at the beayviour of my relations, and, having called for her carridge, got
up to leave the room, with the most dignified hair. I, of coarse, rose to
conduct her to her weakle. Ah, what a contrast it was 1 There it stood,
with stars and garters hall hover the pannels; the footmin in peach-
coloured tites; the hosses worth 3 hundred a-peace;—and there stood
the horridlinnen-cart, with ‘MARY BlooDER, Laundress, Ealing, Middlesex,”
wrote on the bord, and waiting until my abandind old parint should
come out.
“CINQBARs insisted upon helping her in. SIR HUDDLEston FUDDLE-
stone, the great barnet from the North, who, great as he is, is as stewpid
as a howl, looked on, hardly trusting his goggle I's as they witnessed the
Sean. But little lively good naterd LADY KITTY Quickset, who was going
away with the Countiss, held her little & out of the carridge to me and
said, “MR. DE LA PLUchE, you are a much better man than I took you to
be. Though her Ladyship is horrified, & though your Grandmother did
take gin for breakfast, don't give her up. No one ever came to harm yet
for honoring their father & mother.’
“And this was a sort of consolation to me, and I observed that all the
good fellers thought none the wuss of me. CINQBARs said I was a trump
for sticking up for the old washerwoman ; LoRD GeoRGE Gills said she
should have his linning; and so they cut their joax, and I let them. But
it was a great releaf to my mind when the cart drove hoff.
“There was one pint which my Grandmother observed, and which, I
muss say, I thought lickwise; “Ho, JEAMEs,’ says she, “hall those fine
ladies in sattns and velvets is very well, but there's not one of em can
hold a candle to MARY HANN.’”
“Railway Spec is going on phamusly. You should see how polite
they har at my bankers now I SIR PAUL PUMP Aldgate, & CoMPANY.
They bow me out of the back parlor as if I was a Nybobb. Every body
says I'm worth half a millium. The number of lines they’re putting
me upon, is inkumseavable. I’ve put FitzwarkEN, my man, upon
several. REGINALD FITzwańREN, Esquire, looks splended in a perspectus;
and the raskle owns that he has made two thowsnd.
“How the ladies & men too, foller & flatter me ! If I go into Lady
BINsis hopra box, she makes room for me, who ever is there, and cries
out, “O do make room for that dear creature I’ And she complyments me
on my taste in musick, or my new Broom-oss, or the phansy of my weskit,
and always ends by asking me for some shares. Old LoRD BAREACREs,
as stiff as a poaker, as prowd as Loosyfer, as poor as JoAB—even he condy-
sends to be sivvle to the great DE LA PLUCHE, and begged me at
HARTHUR's, lately, in his sollom, pompus way, “to ſaver him with five
minutes conversation.' I knew what was coming—application for shares
—put him down on my private list. Wouldn't mind the Scrag End
Junction passing through Bareacres—hoped I’d come down and shoot
there.
“I gave the old humbugg a few shares out of my own pocket. “There,
old Pride,” says I, ‘I like to see you down on your knees to a footman.
There, old Pompossaty! Take fifty pound; I like to see you come
cringing and begging for it.” Whenever I see him in a very public place,
I take my change for my money. I digg him in the ribbs, or slap his
padded old shoulders. I call him, ‘BARBACREs, my old buck l’ and I see
him wince. It does my art good.
“I’m in low sperits. A disagreeable insadent has just occurred.
LADY Pump, the banker's wife, asked me to dinner. I sat on her right,
of coarse, with an uncommon ner me, with whom I was getting on in
my fassanating way—full of ally (as the Marquis says) and easy
plesntry. Old Pump, from the end of the table, asked me to drink
Shampame; and on turning to tak the glass I saw CHARLEs WACKLEs
(with womb I'd been imployed at Colonel. SPURRIERs' house) grinning
over his shoulder at the Butler.
º “The beest reckonized me. Has I was putting on my palto in the
hall, he came up again : “How dy doo, JEAMEs,’ says he, in a findish
visper. “Just come out here, Chawles,’ says I, ‘I’ve a word for you,
my old boy.’ So I beckoned him into Portland Place, with my pus in my
hand, as if I was going to give him a sovaring.
“‘I think you said “JEAMEs,” CHAwles, says I, ‘and grind at me at
dinner?'
“‘Why, sir, says he, “we’re old friends, you know.’
“‘Take that for old friendship then,’ says I, * and I gave him just one
on the noas, which sent him down on the pavemint as if he'd been shot.’
And mounting myjesticly into my cabb, I left the rest of the grinning
scoundrills to pick him up, & droav to the Clubb.”
THE OVERWORKED BARRISTERS’ CLERKS.
THESE unhappy individuals, like the patriotic Swiss, are attempting to
effect arising—in the double name of Freedom and Salary. They complain
that they are overworked and underpaid. It is an error to say that they
have nothing to do if their masters are briefless ; for who shall cook the
daily chop at chambers, clean the economic Bluchers, and answer the
door to the herd of duns that beset the threshold of the forensic destitute
It is true the Clerk gets the half-crowns—when they come; but to the
question,--"Where are they?” Echo significantly answers, “Not knowing,
can't positively say.” |

THE DURE OF CAMBRIDGE AND THE POACHER.

Know ye the land of roast-beef and plum-pudding
Know ye the metropolis of venison and turtle Hºw
strange it is that in that land, in that metropolis, there
exists as yet no school of culinary art l But a scheme
has been set on foot for the obliteration of this national
blot. A petition now lies at our office for signatures,
praying Parliament, in its wisdom, to found a llege of
Cookery. This institution is intended for the instruction
of young ladies in a hitherto shamefully neglected branch
of their education. It was first proposed by some influ-
ential gentlemen in the City, to whom its notion was
suggested by a comparison of the corporate with the
domestic board. What study can be more incumbent on
ladies than cookery 1
At present Man is the producer, whilst, amongst the
affluent at least, Woman is the mere consumer. She
might as well, surely, prepare the food that he procures.
She will be glad to do it, too, if she is wise. The attrac-
tions at the head of the table will be enhanced by those
of its garniture, and ameliorated dinners will make do-
mesticated husbands. -
We hope, indeed, that Colleges of Cookery will be esta-

of CAMBRIDGE with poaching on his Royal Highness's preserves. The illustrious com-
plainant observed that he had long devoted himself to a particular kind of game, and
he was, he believed, known to be an ardent lover of the sports of the very wide field,
which public dinners presented to him. He had cultivated this delightful pastime with so
much diligence and success that he believed he could bag a greater number of dinners than
any one else within a given period. He had, in fact, become such a capital shot that he
could bring down an invitation at an enormous distance ; and he was now annoyed by
seeing the defendant interfering with those enjoyments of which he, the DUKE of CAM-
BRIDGE, had been desirous of procuring the monopoly.
The Magistrate asked what proof there was of the defendant's intention to interfere with
the rights of the Duke of CAMBRIDGE:
His Royal Highness said that the defendant was found with a benevolent speech in his
possession, which clearly came under the head of a snare. Several invitations had been
caught by the nets made from the philanthropic yarn, which the defendant was so fond
of spreading out in all directions. The Magistrate asked if any case could be brought
home to the defendant —when, the Duke of CAMBRIDGE reluctantly admitting there
could not, the complaint was dismissed. His Royal Highness, on leaving, declared he
propose to render a course of study at one of these Col-
leges, and a satisfactory examination at the close of it,
a necessary qualification for matrimony. We would have

A MEDICAL LECTURE ON THE RAILWAY MANIA.
ALUABLE Lectures on Insanity have been
lately delivered by DR. Conolly, of
Hanwell; but he has omitted to men-
tion one of its most serious forms. We
allude to the Railway mania; and we
hope DR. ConoLLY will not be angry if
we presume to suggest what he might
have said respecting it. The Railway
mania; is a disorder of the wits, princi-
pally incidental, to those who live by
them ; but it is by no means unknown
among capitalists possessed of less wit
than money. -
The predisposing causes of this dis-
order are a sanguine and credulous
disposition, combined with a strong love of money, and a constitutional
dislike to work. Its immediate or exciting cause is usually a tempting
advertisement, calculated to inflame these passions; it is also largely
propagated by the contagion of example, or by a species of inoculation,
effected by the operation of biting.
The first symptoms of the Railway mania are idleness and inattention
to business, and a neglect of study; the patient leaving good books to
read the newspaper supplements. As the disorder progresses, the con-
versation becomes wild and incoherent, and remarkably disagreeable to
all sane hearers, by running continually on Shares, Scrip, Premiums, and
Grand Junctions, so as to resemble nothing but the confused jargon of
Capel Court. By degrees, reason is prostrated, and the moral feelings
are perverted, so that the sufferer becomes deprived of the power of
taking care of himself, and the perception of what he owes to others.
Under these circumstances he writes frantically for Shares in Lines that
are, and always will be, imaginary; and, to purchase them, throws away all
the money he has, and renders himself liable for much more. He sells
out Three per Cents., mortgages houses and estates, disposes of his business,
and commits various other acts of extravagance.
At length, his violence having become mischievous, he is confined; but,
unfortunately, as his disorder is an unrecognised madness, his only asylum
is the workhouse or the gaol. In the treatment of the Railway mania,
the first thing requisite is, early seclusion. If allowed to go about at all,
his hands should be muffled, to prevent him from writing for Shares; and
his mouth s"; to hinder him from persuading others to commit the
same folly. By far the better course, however, is to shut him up as soon.
as the first symptoms manifest themselves; that is, the moment he begins
to talk nonsense about Shares.” With this measure may be combined cold
lotions to the head, the shower-bath, and bleeding and blistering, if ne-
cessary, as they are very likely to be. Modern science has mitigated the
severities that formerly attended the treatment of mania; but if they are
serviceable in any form of it, they are likely to be so in this; and if any
unfortunate madman ought to be tied up and flogged, we should say it.

he expectation of the public was on tiptoe to
ascertain, from the result of the New
Opera, whether the Old Drury Lane
superstition was to be destroyed, that
BALFE is the only composer of the day,
and the Poet BuNN the only poet. MR.
!, WALLAce has, by a triumphant success,
settled the first point; but the second is
destined to remain still doubtful, for the
libretto has not been allowed to pass
without the Poet BuNN having a hand in
it. The piece is not suffered to proceed far
into the second act, ere the audience is
surprised by the sudden introduction of a
BALLAD,
(By ALFRED BUNN, Esq., at the request
of the Author and Composer).
We can º the Author and Composer
finding themselves suddenly in a dead fix
for want of inspiration, and calling entreat-
ingly on the Poet Buxx to get them out of
the horrible dilemma. Let us see how
he has helped them. We can imagine his
throwing himself into his easy-chair, having
first locked the door of his room, and placed
a notice on the outside stating, according to
his usual custom, that “the Poet is com-
posiug.” When such is the case, and it
is now an every-day occurrence, the or-
chestra at rehearsal have orders to put
on their mutes. The buffo HARLEY is
desired to give his stage-managerial direc-
tions in an under-tone ; the carpenters
are made to Inuffle their hammers, that
no sound may be heard to disturb the Poet
at his lyre. Such precautions having been
taken, the Poet BuNN achieved the follow-
ing morceau, at the request of the Author
and Composer of Maritana, which we shall
take the liberty of interlarding with such
ºf critical observations as happen to suggest
themselves:—
“In happy moments, day by day,
The sands of life may pass;–"
(This idea was probably suggested to the
Poet BuNN by the daily passing of a
sand-cart before his door, amid the musical cries of “Sand, hol” from
the driver.) -
“In swift but tranquil tide away,
From Time's unerring glass."
(Here we get a pleasant notion of Old Time having broken his, egg-
boiler, for how otherwise could the sand be running in a “tranquil tide
away” from the glass alluded to ? But, allons.)
“Yet hopes we used as bright to deem "
(As bright as what, good Poet 1)
“Remembrance will recal;
Whose pure and whose unfading beam
(That's exactly what we want to know ourselves, and we therefore reite-
rate whose pure ? and whose ºf. * We would beta dump against
the Poet's next new ballad, that the Poet himself could not give a satisfac-
tory answer to the question.)
“Is dearer than them all.”
(What is dearer than them all Is it the hopes, the remembrance, or
the beam, that is dearer than them all ! And what is this all, after all,
that the hopes, or the remembrance, or the beam, are, or is, dearer than ?)
“Though anxious eyes upon us gaze,
And hearts with fondness beat;
Whose smile upon each feature plays
With truthfulness replete.”
(Now, we have a great mind to file a bill in equity against the Poet Bunn,
to pray for an account, and force him to disclose, in reply to certain inter-
rogatories, whether he means “Whose smile” to be the smile of the
anxious eyes, or the fondly beating hearts, or both, or neither, or if not,
why not, or how otherwise; and whether each feature is the feature of the
person with the anxious eye, or the property of the owner of the beating
heart, or whether it is appurtenant to the playing smile, or if not, why
not ; or if either or neither, or one or both, or all or none of these alter-
natives were intended by the Poet BuNN ; and if not, why not, and how
otherwise?)
“Some thoughts none others can replace,”
(Here we get a bit of refreshing fact at last. Some thoughts—the Poet
BUNN's thoughts for instance—none others can replace. That’s very
true, Poet; but why spoil a piece of matter of fact by lugging in head
and ºlder. or neck and crop, an unmeaning line from the previous
verse 1)
“Remembrance will recal,
Which in the flight of years we trace,
Is dearer than them all.”
(This is such a jumble, that we give it up at once, and offer one pound
(of gingerbread), reward to any charity-boy in any of the metropolitan
parishes, who will produce a more complicated piece of nonsense than this,
which, “at the request of the Author and Composer,” the Poet BUNN has
perpetrated.)
PRINCE ALBERT AND POTATOES.
His Royal HIGHNEss has manifested another of the many
princely liberalities towards Literature and Science that will for ever
connect his name with the Intellect of England. He has, in his own
magnificent way, patronised the Potato-speech of Doctor Buck-
LAND. But our words are poor and feeble to set forth the munifi-
cence. Therefore, we borrow that very large silver trumpet, the
Windsor Express —
“KIND Consid ERATIon of PR ince Albent.—At a time when the Potato disease
is employing so much of public attention, it cannot be otherwise than gratifying to
know that His Royal High Nass Prince Albert has, with the kindness which is
so prominent a feature of his character, caused the distribution, by the resident clergy
in several districts, of extrats from a speech delivered by Dr. Buckland, Professor of
Geology, at the 1 own Hall, Birmingham ; wherein the proper treatment of the Potato,
under erºsting circumstances, is set forth. The usefulness of these extracts will be
generally acknowledged, and His Royal Highness will receive the thanks which his
meritorious conduct so highly deserves.
“Extracts from a speech 1” Now, the printing of some ten thou-
sand copies—even at a cheap printer's—would certainly amount to
at least five pounds—a very large amount ot benevolence in so trying
a season. We understand that some of the folks who have received
copies of the “Extracts” that teach them the proper treatment of
the potatoes, have impudently inquired when the PRINCE will send
the potatoes themselves? To a hungry man, too poor to buy a dinner,
the present of a Cookery Book is doubtless a scurvy jest. But then,

much conduce to MR. Buckingham's self-complacency, did he know the
various MS. comments inscribed on the margin of the document: but of
this enough. The paper came too late for full consideration in our present
Number : we garner it for our next. In the mean time, we must, in jus-
tice to MR. Buckingham, observe, that the thing is only another instance
of his matchless ingenuity to draw upon himself and his establishment the
notice of the public. The British and Foreign Institute wants members—
more live material ; and MR. BuckinghAM, in this, his long-deferred reply
to Punch, adroitly advertises for the stock. . . * • A /

He most thrilling sensation has been created in the circles
-- of ton, in the neighbourhood of Lambeth, by the sudden
disappearance of Miss Sophia SARAH SMITH, the young
- and lovely scion of the House of Coburg. The young
T lady must have quitted Coburg House while her illus.
trious sire was measuring a remnant of ribbon. She
was observed to walk very quickly towards a West End
'bus, where she was received by a military-looking
gentleman in blue, with his face muffled up in a cape

and the waterman on the stand, knowing Miss SMITH,
made an observation to the crossing-sweeper, who knew the companion of
her flight, and at once pronounced him to be SERGEANT TIMs of the Me-
tropolitan Police Force. A cab was in waiting at Trafalgar Square, with
instructions to take the runaways an eightpenny fare in the direction of
Wapping.
We must now return to MR. SMITH, who, on retiring to tea, missed
his daughter.
resolution was to go nowhere until he had finished his tea, when he gave
vent to his feelings in a flood of hand-bills. In the mean time, the
runaways had been united in wedlock by the Registrar of the district;
and young TIMs, who had got leave of absence for two hours, returned to
his beat as if nothing had happened. -
SERGEANT TIMs is the son of old TIMs, which is some alleviation to the
sufferings of the head of Coburg House, who bears it as well as can be
expected. The young gentleman is a great favourite with his Inspector,
and has distinguished himself at the taking of several pickpockets. The
runaways first met at BARON NATHAN's, on the occasion of the celebrated
Polka des CEufs being danced by that distinguished man, at the same
soirée in which he introduced the Tarantella des Tea-things.
RAILWAY ACCIDENTS.
In the prospectus of every Railway, an announcement is always made
of the Engineer, Solicitor, Banker, and Surveyor, who is appointed to the
Line ; but not a word is ever said of the appointment of a Surgeon. From
the latter being always excluded, one would imagine there was nothing on
a liailway for a Surgeon to do.

JEAMES-S DIARY.
Ave this day kimpleated a little efair with my friend
George, EARL BAREACREs, which I trust will be to the ad-
vantidge both of self & that noble gent. Adjining the
BAREACRE proppaty is a small piece of land of about 100
acres, called Squallop Hill, igseeding advantageous for the
cultivation of sheep, which have been found to have a
pickewlear fine flaviour from the natur of the grass, tyme,
heather, and otherhodarefarus plants which grows on that
mounting in the places where the rox and stones dont
prevent them. Thistles here is also remarkable fine, and
the land is also devided hoff by luxurient Stone Hedges—
much more usefle and ickonomicle than your quickset, or
any of that rubbishing sort of timber; indeed the sile is
of that fine natur, that timber refuses to grow there alto-
gether. I gave BAREacREs 50+ an acre for this land (the
igsact premium of my St. Helena Shares)—a very handsom
price for land which never yielded two shillings an acre;
Jº and very convenient to his Lordship I know, who had a bill
coming due at his Bankers which he had given them.
JEAMEs De La Pluche, Esquire, is thus for the fust time a
landed propriator—or rayther, I should say, is about to reshume the rank & dignity
in the country which his Hancestors so long occupied.”
“I have caused one of ouringinears to make me a plann of the Squallop Estate,
Diddlesexshire, the property of &c., &c., bordered on the North by Lond Bºreaches'
Country; on the West by Sir GRANBY GRowler; on the South by the Hotion. An

to make a survey of the Great Caffrarian line, has built me a beautiful Villar (on
paper), Plushton Hall, Diddlesex, the seat of I de La P., Esquire. The house is repra-
sented a handsome Italian Structer, imbusmdin woods, and circumwented by beautiful

what will the old washywoman, my grandmother, say? She
may sell her mangle then, and too by my honour as a

“As for Squallop Hill, its not to be emadgind that I was
going to give 5000 lb. for a bleak mounting like that, unless
I had some ideer in vew. Ham I not a Director of the

Old Bone House, Single Gloster, and Scrag End, through
which cities our line passes? I will have 40,000 lb. for
that mounting, or my name is not JEAMEs. I have aranged
a little barging too for my friend the Erl. The line will pass
through a hangle of Bareacre Park. He shall have a good
compensation I promis you; and then I shall get back the
3000 I lent him. His banker's acount, I fear, is in a
horrid state.”
[The Diary now for several days contains particulars of
no interest to the public:-Memoranda of City
dinners—meetings of Directors –fashionable parties
in which MR. JEAMEs figures, and almost always
by the side of his new friend, Lord BARBaches,
whose “pompossaty,” as described in the last
Number, seems to have almost entirely subsided.]
We then come to the following :-

we wore French grey jackets, leathers, red morocco boots,
crimson pelisses, brass helmets with leopard-skin and a white

For my part. I decidedly recommend the Deputy Lieutenant.

PEEL'S GAMES.
WE understand that the PREMIER is shortly about to publish a new
edition of Hoyle, embracing all the new games and tricks which, by a
skilful knowledge of how to play his cards, SIR Robert PEEL has become
master. He intends devoting an entire chapter to shuffling, which is
an art of itself, and one which the PREMIER has carried to the utmost
perfection. There will be a few pages devoted to hints on cutting, with
remarks on the proper time to cut, and a few general observations on the
treatment of the pack, so as to make a good hand of it. Tricks will occupy
a very large space in the PREMIER's work; but the games will be the chief
feature. Cribbage, as played at the expense of the Whigs, will be elabo-
rately explained ; and a chapter on revokes will explain how it is that
there is nothing irrevocable in the games of the PREMIER.
The work will be emblazoned with a splendid portrait of SIR Robert
Peel as the Knave of Spades, in which character he appeared the other
day, at the commencement of the works on the Trent Valley Railway.
THE MAMMOTH HORSE.
The following stanzas were written in a moment of dejection, after
reading a paragraph in the papers on the subject of a Mammoth horse
that has recently arrived in London, and stands amazingly high among its
equestrian fellows:– .
THE MAMMOTH stEED.
Oh, give me but my Mammoth steed,
My horse of wondrous height,
And I will up to London speed,
To make of him a sight.
He looks a mountain as he stands,
He's very tall indeed;
His height is more than twenty hands,-
My wondrous Mammoth steed
If to the battle's heat I rush,
My Mammoth steed, no doubt,
The strongest enemy would crush,_
My beautiful, my stout.
The fat upon his wondrous flanks
Would certainly succeed
In smothering the foeman's ranks,—
My own, my Mammoth steed.

THE GRETNA GREEN DIRECT ATMOSPHERIC
RAILWAY COMPANY.
| Mr. Punch assures the public that this projected Railway, of whose
Company he has constituted himself Chairman, is a bonā fide undertaking.
He has no objection, as a philosopher, to blowing bubbles; but he repu-
|diates that amusement as an honest man. The present notification,
therefore, is not addressed to Stags, although it intimately concerns
| Bucks, a race of gentlemen, above all others, interested in obtaining a
| facility of transit to Gretna Green. The advantages of a Railway con-
veyance to that locality will be obvious. The rate of travelling will be
such as to baffle the most determined parent, the best horses, and most
honest and energetic postboys. The Line being an atmospheric one, all
chance of a collision will be avoided, especially of that most awkward
kind of collision—a collision with the friends of the runaway heiress.
A consideration even more important than those foregoing, is the
following one :
Of all travelling, a trip to Gretna Green is, at present, the most
expensive. The advantages of the journey, therefore, are confined to the
nobility, gentry, and, may we add, clergy. The Gretna Green Railway
will place the Green within the reach of the public at large ; and while
the first-class trains will convey peers, baronets, and other members of
the aristocracy with their fair companions; the second and third trains
will accommodate respectable shopkeepers, mechanics, and agricultural
labourers. The terminus will be close to the Temple of Hymen, so that
the travellers may step from the former to the latter at once. The only
fear that Punch has for the success of his project is, that one of the first
things that Parliament will do, next Session, will be, to abolish the
privileges of Gretna Green, a thing which, in the opinion of many, it
ought to have done long ago.,
Cambridge on the Right Divine of Rings.
We think it was Bolingbaoke who declared that he should never
believe in the right divine of kings, until monarchs were born with crowns
on their heads, like cocks with combs. Certainly, Royalty, thus endowed,
would at once vindicate its divine origin, and cause a considerable saving
in the article of diadems. However, the Duke of CAMBRIDGE requires no
such fleshly excrescence to assure him in the divine faith. His late
eloquent speech at Hanover proves how very intimate he is with the ways
and intentions of Providence. Destiny is as familiar to him as the well-
fed face of Toast-master Toole; for, making his speech on the birth of
the Hanoverian Prince, the Duke said:—“I have ever regarded it as a
great benefit to a country, that the succession to the Crown should remain
assured in the line prescribed by the decrees of Heaven 1 " . In which case,
what does His Royal Highness think of the succession of the House of
Hanover to the dethronement of the House of Stuart?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
MISS MALONY AND FATHER LUKE.
Patrick Street, Cork, Nov. 20.
- Miss
BIDDY MALONY presents
her compliments to Punch,
and begs to submit to him
the following statement:—
“My grandmother dying,
and the winther comin on
she was the daughther to the
ULLIGAN, of Castle Mulligan,
and cousin by the mother's
side, who was a Fitzsimons,
of Clonakilty, to the Right
Honourable the EARL of
BALLywhacker), I thought I
could do nothing betther with
the legacy which she left me
(Heaven rest her sowl!) than
purchase me a new muff and
tippet. I saw a sweet sable
shuit at MR. Fitzgubbon's, in
Great George's Street—and
(as nothing looks better with mourning, or shuits my complexion better)
I purchased muff, boa, and cuffs, complete. A more elegant set of furs
there is not in all Cork: as for MRs. KINAILY's pelisse that she brags of
these two years, I believe they’re dyed—I know her hair is : but this,
please not to mention.
“Sunday last was a sweet cold morning, and I went to eight-o'clock
mass with my dear AMALIA BRodigAN, who was dying with envy of the
tippet and muff. There wasn't a lady in chapel but I believe was in a
fury with poor me—a sad frame of mind, Mr. Punch, to go to Chapel in
“FATHER Luke no sooner catches sight of my new sables than he
frowns on me as if they didn't become me: and O, Sir! fancy my horror
when he stands up and exhorts the congregation from the altar, looking
steadfastly at me all the while.
“‘Women of Ireland :' says he: “women descended from those three
hundthred virgins whom the bloody Saxon CRomwell slew at Wexford;
women who inhabit a land whose vallies are the greenest, whose rivers are
the clearest, whose mountains are the highest in the worrrld. What saeri-
fices are you prepared to make to that bleeding, that beautiful counthree ?
The wicked Saxon has blighted the potato-crop, and rejoices in the pros-
pect of the national famine. The agonies of our children feast his heart
with hellish joy; do they awaken no sympathies in yours? Are
you not prepared to do everything to rescue your starving country-
men? Our Sublime Liberator permits it : enjoins it. Thatº Great
Philanthropist cannot subscribe himself, for he is poor—but he calls
upon you, his children, to make every sacrifice. Father of our coun-
thry, shall not your daughthers obey you?' We were all affected to
tears of rage against the Saxon—whom, except yourself, dear Punchy,
and perhaps CAPTAIN SMITH, of the 190th (with whom I danced at Mallow
Race-ball), and who is a very nice young man, I detest cordially—and we
protested we were ready to make any sacrifice for our suffering country-
men. Then, Mr. Punch, came the cruel cruel attack on poor me !
“‘Any sacrifice "roars FATHER LUKE. “Can you talk of sacrifices,
who have spent fifteen guineas on a muff and tippet —you, who are
decking yourself with fine raiment when your country is in mourning
—you, who are flaunting in gorgeous apparel when Ireland is naked and
cold * Every eye in the chapel turned towards me: the people round
about moved away from me and left me alone; and as for that odious
Miss BRopio AN, she gave a grin of triumph, much more becoming a fiend
than a Christian woman and cousin of my own, which she is, the
BRodigANs of Brodigan Town being connected with the Loonys of
Drumclubber—first cousins of ours, as everybody knows.
“Well, Sir, I left the chapel in anguish of mind, as you may fancy; and
have had all Cork calling upon me since to condole with me. But I want
to know—was it quite fair for his Reverence to attack me ! I paid my
thirty-shilling note to the Tribute; every blessed Sabbath I put my shil-
ling in the plate: I may have my charities, too, at home; but there is no
.#. publish them; and I think it's cruel entirely that I should be for-
bidden to purchase in the shops, and that Father Luke will not let me
and my poor boa and tippet alone: I, who subscribed to the silver tea-
service, too, which the Ladies gave him. I warrant you he didn't cry out
at the extravagance of that.
“Please, dear Mr. Punch, take my case in hand, and defend your
constant reader, the poor defenceless innocent.
* BIDDY MALONY.”
IDeadly Poisons.
The French have been distributing Crosses of the Legion of Honour to
Chinese Mandarins. The English introduce opium into China, but the
French prefer importing Crosses of the Legion of Honour. They evi-
dently rely on their old proverb: “Il n'y a rien quitue comme le ridicule.”
“ALLow me,” says the Duke to Peel,
“To introduce a man whose zeal
Was e'en too warm for India's sphere.”
“What, ELLENBoRough "PEEL replied,
“I’m sorry he should be denied—
But, 'pon my word, he can't lodge here.”
The ARMY.
Monality is finding its way even to the Horse Guards. The military
authorities are no longer to angle with lies for recruits: the gudgeons are
to be caught after another fashion. The Recruiting Sergeant is no longer
to be the Clown in the bloody pantomime of Glory. No : for the Bath
Journal informs us—
“The militia are to have a most efficient staff in each county: one-third of the
main body of the militia to be embodied for three years' exercise, at the same time
allowing the men to rotunteer to the line, with certain regulations to subaltern officers
to extend their services also.”
This “allowing the men to volunteer to the line" is only an extension
of Mrs. Bond's benevolent principle of “allowing” the ducky, ducky,
ducky, to come and be killed ! However, the Journal assures us. that
this measure will “put a stop to the demoralising scenes witnessed in all
public-houses to catch a recruit.” We wonder what the Iron Duke says
to this. According to his own showing, what has morality to do with
glory? For is it not among the Duke's recorded apophthegm. that “ men
who go for soldiers should not be nice about religion ”? The Duke's
notion of the Army of Martyrs is—an army with more drums than prayer-
books.
RAILWAY INTELLIGENCE.
OUR own snug little suburban Railway, the “Kensington and Shepherd's
Bush,” has given notice of an extension, and we have no doubt it would
run to any lengths if Parliament would grant its permission. We cannot
conceive what point this eccentric little Line can possibly be driving at.
There is some talk of its spreading out its little arms towards Little
Chelsea, in which case it will perhaps embrace Pimlico. We understand
that the concern has lately set up a horse and cart to carry out Slay
Cross coals at eighteen-pence a hundred, which are brought from Shep-
herd's Bush once a day in the first class carriages.
A King “Jeannes."
We learn from Palermo that the King of the Two Sicilies had a
tremendous “ struggle of politeness” with the EMPEROR of Russia, to
yield “the place of honour” in the Royal carriage. At length, “ the cºn;
test ended by the King taking the footman's place behind the vehicle.
There have been kings who could not be better placed.

THE END OF THE WORLD.
A great secret is advertised to be sold by
a “MR. DEALTRY, Minister of the Gospel.”
For the small charge of “to the body of the
hall, 2d.,” and “to the platform, 3d,” anybody
may purchase of the said MR. DEALTRY a
knowledge of the day and hour on which this
wicked world of ours is to go to pieces. MR.
DEALTRY has exclusive intelligence of the
tremendous finis about to be put to all things.
We should like a sight of him. A man made
the depositary of such awful knowledge must
be a solemn creature to contemplate. He is
as well worth the twopence, or even the three-
penny stare from the platform, as the Ojibbe-
ways were worth a shilling. And more than this, “the startling fact”
of the earth's speedy destruction “will be shown from DANIEL's visions,
illustrated by canvas: ”nothing, however, is said about music or dancing.
We recommend MR. DEALTRY to the proprietors of PARR's Pills. Having
clearly shown that dissolution is threatened to all men, he might then put
off the nostrum as the only life-preserver in the tremendous catastrophe. A
liberal allowance might be made to families.
Too Much of A Good Thing.—Parliament is to meet early in January.
It had better be prorogued till the Christmas pantomimes are over.
The ANATOMY OF THE BARRISTER’S TONGUE.
At a late meeting of a medico-legal society, which is wont to assemble
periodically in Pump Court, Temple, an interesting paper was read by
Paofessor Plodder, on the “Anatomical Peculiarities of the Barrister's
Tongue,” as discovered by the examination of the organ in question in a
large number of instances.
The Professor commenced by stating that he had prosecuted researches
on many legal subjects; and in every subject that had come under his
notice he had found the vocal organ of an unusual length, as he showed
by the production of several specimens, and their comparison with the
tongue of the chameleon, ant-eater, and other animals. He showed that
the length and suppleness of the tongue formed in these animals a beauti-
ful provision of Nature for seizing their prey, and insinuated that the
same peculiarities in the Barrister might have a similar purpose.
He next enlarged on the great number and complexity of the muscles
connected with the forensic tongue, which enabled it to move backwards
and forwards, and to this side or that, with wonderful facility. He showed,
in particular, its admirable adaptation to circuitous or roundabout move-
ments, so essential to the practice of pleading. The extreme muscular
power of the Barrister's tongue, he said, was such as to enable it to say
anything; and, in corroboration of this statement, cited several false-
hoods, and other monstrous things, which had been uttered by Barristers,
and which he conceived impossible for any other human beings to utter.
He then demonstrated that what in the ordinary subject are mere
bundles of fibres, become, in the Barrister, distinct muscles of large size,
to which, as the discoverer, he had ventured to assign a nomenclature.
For this he begged to apologise as somewhat canine in its Latinity, though
not more so, he hoped, than anatomical terms in general. The chief of
these muscles were as follows:–
The Simulator and Dissimulator muscles; which enabled the Barrister
to feign what he did not feel, and to dissemble what he felt, according to
the exigencies of his case.
The Suppressor Weri muscle; by whose aid he suppressed the truth at
his convenience.
The Suggestor Falsi muscle; by means of which he could insinuate a
fallacy, when necessary, into the minds of Jurymen.
The Minax, or bullying muscle, which served for intimidating witnesses.
The Perturbator, or bothering muscle; for the purpose of perplexing
them, so as to make them swear to what was untrue.
The Patheticus Linguae, or pathetic muscle of the tongue; used in
making clap-trap appeals to British juries.
The Detractor muscle; whose function was to vilify the character of an
opponent's client.
*All these muscles; the Professor stated, possessed a peculiar irrita-
bility; in virtue of which they were singularly sensitive to the influence
of the metal, gold, which was such as to command the action of any or all
of them.
THE BISHOPS HOUSE-VARMING.
THE Esser Herald delights us with the glad tidings that the Loan
Bishop of RochestER “has taken full possession of the new episcopal
palace at Danberry.” Now, when it is remembered that this palace is the
job of the Church Commissioners; when it is borne, in mind that this
episcopal abiding-place is cribbed from so many churches, the house-
warming of his Grace becomes a matter for serious contemplation. It
took merely a hatful of thousands to erect this episcopal palace—some-
thing about thirty thousand, we believe, to house the apostolical successor
of the fishermen and tent-makers. Thirty thousand pounds,-when,
according to the confessions of the Commissioners, the spiritual condition
of the people is at the lowest ebb, for the want of church-accommodation.
Pondering on this fact, we may consider the Danberry.palace as a fabrie
erected from the spoils of the poor and spiritually forlorn. However, let
the pauper heed not the want of a seat in the poorman's church, when his
Grace of Rochester is cushioned so cosily in a palace at Danberry. We
do not find this sort of Christianity in any approved copy of the New
Testament; but a bishop may now and then act from his own variorum
edition. The bishop, however, says the Esser Herald, “has already evinced
a liberal spirit and kind consideration for those around him.”. And how?
why, being welcomed “by a merry peal of the village bells,” the ringer:
were “liberally rewarded, and afterwards provided with a substantial
supper 1" We should expect nothing less from his Grace: for he is,
indeed, ungrateful who will not reward his propertrumpeter. ..
comMission of Lunacy.-A CLEAR CASE.
A few days since, a Commission of Lunacy was opened, when it was
proved that the lunatic “had got it into his head that he would take
covent Garden theatre!" whereupon the Jury, without hesitation, found
him very mad indeed.

PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
Anon. A rule originally derived from the Latin word
Canna, a stick or came, because in early days the only
way to promulgate a rule among the people was to beat
it into them. The word cannon, a gun, is the same as
canon, a rule, which generally applies to things ecclesias-
tical, and was particularly appropriate to
a church disposed to be rather militant.
The word canons also came to be applied
to the persons themselves, who were di-
vided into regular and secular; from
which we no doubt got the English term , WT
“regular son of a gun,” intended, pro- ... ſº
bably, as a secular sarcasm at the ex-
pense of the regulars. The secular canons
are still found in cathedrals, and some of them are said
to be fond of a good bottle of wine, or, in other words,
like to be loaded with grape up to the very muzzle.
Cash, ride CREDIT, which is the only medium through which an
acquaintance with cash is sometimes cultivated.
CENsus. The numbering and classifying of the people, which
takes place every ten years, when the whole human pack is sorted,
after the long shuffling it has experienced. The last Census was in
1841, and included all who slept in dwellings on the night of the 6th
of June ; but there should, of course, be a liberal allowance made for
those who did “not go home till morning, till daylight did appear.”
The result showed a large increase in the population, and the Census
was so accurate that there was only two babies and a butcher's-boy
unaccounted for in the County of Middlesex, and a few brokers
missing from the Stock Exchange.
CAPTAIN. From the Latin word caput, a head; though some
Captains have so very little head that we can see no
analogy between the primitive and the derivative.
There is in the army a Captain to every company,
but in the navy every company—that is to say,
every Steam-boat Company—has a great number
of Captains. It was in the old French navy a
point of honour on the part of the Captain to sink
with his ship, and blow it up rather than allow it
In the Thames navy the passengers often blow up the

ship, and they sometimes blow up the Captain, who begins blowing
up the crew, in case of a collision or other accident.
CENTRAL CRIMINAL Court. A place for holding conversaziones
between the Bench and the Bar, who occasionally suspend their small
talk for the purpose of trying a prisoner.
CERTIon ARI. A sort of legal locomotive for moving law proceed-
ings, or a kind of crane for drawing them up from an inferior to a
superior court.
CHAMBERLAIN. From the word cubicularius, a Roman name for a
slave who had to look after the chambers, a duty that has now
devolved upon the laundresses of the Temple. The LoRD CHAM-
BERLAIN has the control of the household, of which the actors at the
various theatres are supposed to form a part; so that the companies
of the Surrey and Victoria, as well as the troop at Astley's, including
the British Acrobats, the Egyptian Youths, or the Caoutchouc
Unapproachables, are all considered to be the personal attendants
on HER MAJEsty, and as such, are under the authority of the Lond
CHAMBERLAIN.
CARDINAL. The highest Roman Catholic
dignity next to the Pope. The word is
derived from cardo, a hinge, because the
Cardinals will turn either way, and open the
door for anything. When the Pope makes
a Cardinal, he gives him a red hat; and it tº
is supposed that CARDINAL Wolsey pa- :
tronised the Old Mother Red Cap, at Camden
Town, when he and HENRY THE EIGHTH went out on some of their
roystering expeditions to Highgate.
I.iterary Discovery.
The greatest mystery has hitherto prevailed as to the existence of such
a creature as Mrs. Gamp’s “MRs. HARRIs.” This fact, however, is no
longer a matter “unbeknown.” It is proved, beyond a doubt, that MRs.
HARRIS is no less a person than the Editress of the Standard.
Qſìjt ſºlinisters amb the 33ailroats.
We understand that several M.P.'s have, with the view of disqualifying
themselves from serving on Railway Committees, been applying for Shares
wholesale to the various new Lines, that by having an interest they may
be ºxempted from the severe duties of Committee-men. Among the
applications is one from the PREMIER, in the usual form, from which we
give an extract. After the body of the application, we find the “Name in
Jull,” after which comes the “address;” and under the head of “Business or
Profession, if any,” we get the candid admission that “the applicant's
professions are too numerous and too various to mention.” As referees
he gives two names, being those of Lord John Russell, and the Duº
of Buckingham. On those parties being applied to in the usual way by
the company, to ascertain the respectability of the applicant for Shºres
the answer returned by Lond John Russeli was to the following effect :-
“SIR,
“I believe Robert PEEL, who has applied to you for Shares, to be
a well-meaning man; but I do not know whether I am justified in saying
much more in his favour. As to his complying with calls, I think, if the
calls are very peremptory, he is almost sure to attend to them, though he
may be rather dilatory in doing so.
“I have the honour to be, &c. &c.,
“J. Russell.”
The answer from the Duke of BuckinghAM was by no means so satis-
factory. It briefly remarked that—“the Duke of Buckingham certainly
knows Sid R. Peel, the applicant for Shares, and, indeed, knows him a
great deal too well. The Duke of Buckingham would not trust the
applicant for Shares; but of course leaves the Directors of the Railway
Company to use their own discretion.”
“THE WELLINGTON LETTERS.”
HESE missives, we understand, have been
formed into a collection, uniform with the
Dispatches, about to be edited by Colonel
GURwood. They are said to be models
of the epistolary style, in which all the small
courtesies and minor graces of life are
made subservient to regimental brevity
of expression. Some of them, too, blow
hot and cold in the most valiant manner;
particularly those in the case of the SHRAP-
NEL family, wherein the Duke promises
the late Colonel “to assist, by every means
in his power, to procure a reward for
him,”—followed by a subsequent letter
to the Colonel's representative, in which the same gallant Field-Marshal
“positively declines to apply for MR. Needham Scrope SHRApnel in any
manner, or to any authority.” We have, as in duty bound, a tremendous
opinion of his Grace; though we may stop a little short of the idolatry
professed by the spinsters of May Fair... Nevertheless, with such spinsters,
we cannot but think that Iron Dukes, like Iron Pokers, are none the worse
for just a little polish.
E P I G R A M
ON THE PRICE OF ADMISSION TO SEE THE MAMMOTH HORSE.
I would not pay a coin to see
An animal much larger;
Surely the Mammoth horse must be
Rather an over-charger.
THE TERRORS OF THE THAMES,
ConsidenABLE consternation is felt among the various Crews and
Captains in the above-bridge navy, at the bold and reckless conduct of the
Bee and Ant in their passages up and down the Channel. The opposition
vessels complain bitterly of the terrific quantity of Bees’-whacks they
are compelled to tolerate. The Ant is said to be almost as formidable in
her movements, and, with the peculiar instinct of the ant, it is rapidly
undermining the foundations of some of the older Companies.
Peel's WEAKNESS,
TheRE is a rumour that Lord STANLEY is about to leave the present
Ministry. This looks as if it were on the point of breaking up, for we
know the old proverb :—“A rat always deserts a sinking vessel.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE “STANDARD.”
HE poor old Standard put itself into
a dreadful flutter a few evenings
ago, and flapped its bunting rudely
in the face of Punch, an indignity
that naturally forces him to lay his
hand upon his baton. We should
however as soon think of assaulting
our “grandmother,” the Herald, as
of doing violence to its younger re-
lative. We should in mercy be cau-
tious how we attack with our pen
that which from its feebleness is
literally liable to be knocked down
with a feather. The Standard de-
votes the whole of its first leader
of the 20th of November to a piece
of wretched garrulity, founded on a
stupid and blundering misappre-
hension of the meaning of a cut in
one of our recent numbers. This
utter inability to see a joke would not have surprised us in our
“grandmother;” and we can only imagine that the blindness runs
in the family. The old lady gets literally shrewish at the end of her
torrent of talk, and exclaims threateningly, “our Sovereign shall
not be belied while we have the power to expose the fabricators of
falsehood and their fabrications.”
This is a gratuitous burst of bravado, a propos to nothing, and has
been inspired by our social caricature called “Maternal Solicitude.”
(p.222), in which our readers will recollect a fusby woman, who has in-
dulged in the vulgar weakness of givingher children fine names, is the
principal personage, and in which the purblind Standard insists on
seeing an allusion to the Royal Family. We need not say that
none was dreamt of by us, though the dreary and drowsy old
Standard seems, in a fit of night-mare, to have been troubled by the
vision of disloyalty, which only existed in its own obfuscated brains.
The spoony sentimentality over the Sovereign, whom the Standard
volunteers to shield with its umbrella from our purely imaginary
attack, must surely have been inspired by an additional drop of
“something comfortable” with which aged females are sometimes in
the habit of flavouring their gruel. The idea of the Standard saying
that anything “shall be " or “shall not be,” is really too rich.
PUNCH AND
——
PROPER SPIRit.
It is said the Bude Lights in Trafalgar Square have been tried several
times, but that they cannot be made to burn. The reason of this obsti-
nacy is that they will not lend themselves to illuminate a place which,
they maintain, the less that is seen of it the better.
HUNTING APPoinTMENTS.
MR. Levi's hounds will meet every day next week in the neighbour-
hood of Capel Court, for the purpose of Railway Stag hunting.
GLORIOUS NEWS
Wr live in troublous times, yet is not our daily life unvisited by gleams
of comfort—unsustained by tidings that give strength to the spirit, and
gladness to the heart 1 If any melancholy sceptic deny this, we at once
confound him with the subjoined extract from the daily news:–
“The KING and Queen of the FR ENch, the Qure N of the BELGIANs, the
Duchess of OR leans, the Count of PAR is, the Duchess of NEMouks, and the
DUkr of BRABANT—”
No ; we will not give the whole of the sentence yet. We feel that we
have raised the expectation of the reader; for his heart beats quicker,
and his nerves thrill with an acuter sense of existence, to learn what
wonder—enacted by the royal party — is heralded by the foregoing.
Patience, reader ; be calm, be philosophic : and know, that the King, and
the Queens, and the Duchesses, and the Count, and the Duke, absolutely—
“walked for two hours in the park of St. Cloud on Saturday.”
If the daily paper bring with it heavy tidings, is it not also the herald
of happiness and joy! True it is, we are saddened with the news of a
potato famine; are more than saddened by O'Connell's oratory—that
quack-salver gibberish, mocking the miseries of a nation, and trading
upon wretchedness with the slang of sympathy and patriotism, neverthe-
less, the sadness is lessened, the indignation subsides into sweet repose,
when we find that a batch of royalties have “walked for two hours in the
Park of St. Cloud ' " There is something in the important, the glad intel-
ligence, that more than reconciles us to the worst inequalities of the
human condition. All the rest of the broad sheet may lower with the
records of crime and misery, of want and grief, and all the evils that
hunt poor human nature; nevertheless, there is one bright, effulgent spot
in the daily history of the world—one glorious piece of radiance that rains
down light and hope on man,—and that is the glad, the blissful tidings
that “the KING and Queen of the FRENch—(&c. &c. &c.)—walked
for two hours in the Park of St. Cloud on Saturday !” Yes; on
Saturday !
ALARMING DISEASE IN RAI LWAY STOCK.
We grieve to announce that the blight has spread from the potatoes to
the Provincial Stock Exchanges. The disease has made the most alarming
ravages at Liverpool, Manchester, and Leeds, where large stocks were on
hand. The external appearances were most flourishing, and almost all
the plants seemed to promise well; but they were found to be plants and
nothing else, there being a total want of root when they came to be
examined. Those which have suffered most were grown on a chalk
formation. The rottenness commences with the Stags, and rapidly
spreads to the Brokers. When once they are infected, there are no hopes
of saving the stock. Scarce one good scheme in ten can now be found ;
and the more they are examined, the greater is the per centage of
entirely decayed and useless ones.
The species called the “Director,” which looked so well in the early
part of the season, has generally failed. They shot up too strong at first,
and wanted bottom to endure the very stormy weather we have had
lately. Cutting was largely practised by all respectable members of
the community, and even shutting up in stone jugs has been found
ineffectual to stop the progress of the disorder.
We trust Government will do something to remedy the dreadful effects
of this disorder.
Ireland, to go over the infected districts and carefully separate the good
from the rotten stock.
Much of the Scrip will probably be converted into a pulp, and after-
wards reissued in the form of Repeal Addresses, and other deleterious
forms.
The ports should be instantly opened, and common honesty imported
in the largest quantities possible. At the same time, we are bound to say
|| that we do not see where it is to come from. No nation we know has
more on hand than is required for the supply of its own population—few
so much. The Americans, from whom expectations have been enter-
tained, certainly have none to spare.

M. R. JAM E S S I L. K. BU C K I N G HAM
R. JAMES SILK BUCKINGHAM is an adroit, clever person.
Possibly, he is of that select class, so prodigally endowed by
nature, that they may be considered even too clever. All his life
he has been full of projects: full as a November Guy Fawkes of fire-
works; and, like the squibs and crackers, they have gone off, some
whizzing, some banging, but all ending in not very odorous
vapour. We presume that the “British and Foreign Institute”—
MR. BuckINGHAM's last project—is about to share the fate of the
other bantlings of his brain. Like MADELINE’s taper,
“Its little smoke in pallid moonshine dies; ”
and therefore does MR. BucKINGHAM puff—puff—puff with all his
might to blow it in again. His is the reverse of the difficulty of the
puny knight, for he cannot relume “the little farthing rushlight.”
And so MR. BuckINGHAM, after his own adroit fashion, begs at his
worst need, the revivifying breath of Punch. Well, he shall have it.
We will vouchsafe him a gentle blow.
MR. BuckINGHAM has published an “Appeal against the Slanders
of Punch.” This Appeal—which with a peculiar kind of modesty,
of which he assuredly has the patent, MR. BucKINGHAM requests
all editors to “give insertion to ”—is, indeed, no other than a clever
advertisement of the astounding merits of the house in George
Street, Hanover Square. Until last week, some , months, we
believe, have elapsed since BucKINGHAM's name cast its native
radiance on our columns. At length his wrongs have broken out.
Upon due consideration, he thinks himself, with Acres, a very ill-used
gentleman. Some constitutions take injuries as some take diseases,
which slumber long in the system ere they are outwardly developed.
MR. BuckINGHAM is evidently of this sluggish habit. At length,
however, this “poison”—poison is the word—has broken out, and
MR. B. is evidently at this moment in a terrible state of moral
eruption.
MR. BuckINGHAM owns that Punch “commenced its career with
lively and harmless wit.” On the same authority, however, Punch
now runs a career of slander and misrepresentation. This is the
old story. MR. BuckINGHAM could laugh very heartily at the sport
—until his own turn came. What is lively and harmless wit when
exercised upon others, becomes slander when applied to himself.
MR. BucKINGHAM says—
“It is true that my life has been more varied than that of most men, and my name
has been oftener before the public than that of many others.”
Why, this is true : and therefore, with a full recollection of MR.
BuckINGHAM's many projects, we readily attended to the many
communications addressed to us by various members of the In-
stitute. All the facts that have appeared in Punch have been supplied
by victim-members (as they called themselves) of the Institute itself—
“Keen are his pangs, but keener far to feel—
He nursed the pinion which impell'd the steel !”
But to return to MR. BucKINGHAM's many plans. Can he forget
his notable project of purchasing a line-of-battle ship to take families
round the world, for the amusement and instruction of tender
juveniles A large sum of money was subscribed for that compre-
hensive purpose ; but unfortunately, after a time, the new CAPTAIN
Cook Bucking HAM felt himself in bad health. He could not go
round the world. Well, what became of the funds subscribed
Possibly, however, MR. BucKINGHAM may have forgotten the whole
transaction. Fortunately, however, we have a copy of the Prospectus
in our possession, and may edify our readers with a reprint. If MR.
BuckINGHAM has ever served the public, has he not, on the other
hand, been the first to ask for recompense He boasted that, whilst
in Parliament, he served the booksellers, by obtaining for them a
diminution of the number of presentation books required by the
Universities; and upon this piece of service did he not send round
a begging-letter to the trade for repayment in volumes or hard cash
We shall, now, notice only three assertions put forth by
MR. Bucking HAM. No doubt his sympathy is genuine as it is
intense toward the Royal Family of France. Hence he mourns that
both Whig and Tory papers “look on with silence, if not indifference,
at the disgraceful caricatures of Louis-PHILIPPE and his sons !” If
Louis-PHILIPPE do not immediately become a patron of the
Institute, then—then has Ma. BuckINGHAM wasted his ink. MR.
B. continues:–
“Neither the moral dignity of the throne, the sacredness of the altar, nor the
“PU N C H.”
Ø.
brightest pattern of domestic purity which the Court of this country has perhaps ever
furnished since it has been a kingdom, being sufficient to protect the highest and the
noblest in the land—not merely in station, but in character, attainments and virtue—
from the malignant attacks, and disgusting exhibitions of this unprincipled publi-
cation.”
This burst of indignation we pass unanswered. We leave our
readers—our two hundred thousand readers, for, looking at the
periodical circulation of Punch in every public establishment of the
empire, we can honestly number so many—we leave them to decide
upon the truthfulness of these accusations, which fairly indicate the
spirit of the whole “Appeal.”
... We come to another charge—a most grave one.
“Pretended letters of some of the Members were forged, and printed in its pages as
genuine. A lithographic copy of one of these was sent from the office of Punch to every
one of the Members of the Institute, addressed according to the printed list of their
names, with a view to disgust them with the Institute and its Associates.”
“Letters of some of the Members t” Yes; Mr. BuckINGHAM, the
virtuous, indignant champion of truth, says “letters”! Let the reader
mark a plain tale. A letter—one single missive—was printed in
Punch. This letter was received through the post. It was signed
“GEoRGE Jon Es”—a name distinguished for great literary courage.
This letter we believed—and, be it fully understood, we beliere it still—
to be a genuine production. We printed it. MR. Jon Es was, pos-
sibly, very much laughed at ; for, in truth, the letter had peculiar
claims to the risible. MR. Jon Es, after some time, denied the author-
ship. We lithographed the letter and distributed copies, not “to
disgust Members” of the Institute; but that, as some of them might
possibly know the “fine Roman hand” of Jon Es, they might decide
between the gifted author of Ancient America and Punch. After much
hesitation, Jon Es commenced an action against Punch. It was met.
We were prepared to go into Court even with the author of Tecumseh,
an Israel-Indian tragedy. Then MR. Jon Es bethought himself. And,
finally, Punch's solicitor left him but this alternative ; either to pro-
ceed to issue, or to pay Punch's law expenses. MR. Jon Es magnani-
mously chose the latter course. Very like conscious innocence 1 And
this one letter MR. BuckINGHAM—apostle of truth and temperance!
—multiplies into letters : the solitary adherent Jon Es, he rolls out
into “some Members” . Fortunate would it be for MR. BuckING-
HAM could he realise the latter experiment upon the comparative
few still subscribing to the Institute.
We now come to MR. BuckINGHAM's gravest charge.
“In conclusion, I may add that, unless some steps be taken to stay this plague of
indiscriminate attack and abuse, no institution and no individual will be safe from its
malignant influence, unless it chooses to degrade itself by buying a dishonourable silence.”
We believe that MR. BuckINGHAM airs himself at public meet-
ings as a man of the most scrupulous veracity. For years was he an
itinerant moralist. He moreover corresponds with FATHER MA-
THEw, and is one perfect chrysolite of temperance. In his latter
character, we would he had drunk at the well wherein, according to
the legend, Truth has taken her abode. MR. BucKINGHAM charges
the writers of Punch with systematic extortion. He would brand
them as literary highwaymen, “money, or, what is dearer than your
life, your reputation.” With the most profound contempt for his
inane malice, with the deepest and intensest scorn, we repel his cow-
ardly insinuation. Here is a man, forsooth, with mealy-mouthedness
talking, with curious familiarity, too, of malignity, and slander, and
poison, a man dealing in the most loathsome accusations against a
body of gentlemen at the very time when he knows—ay, as well as
he knows his own poor reality—that he cannot, even by the shadow
of circumstance, substantiate. its truth. We at once pity and
defy him.
For the present we bid farewell to Mr. BuckINGHAM. On reflec-
tion, he will doubtless feel that he has let his pen slip, and that, too,
in mud. For either he must substantiate his grave charge of extor-
tion, or, remaining silent, must be satisfied with the opinion that
must inevitably fall upon the head of him who makes so wicked and
yet groundless an accusation. We think it is BURRE who says of
somebody, “He was contemptible and content.”
Yet one word to MR. BuckINGHAM. We have selected—as we
think—the chief points of his “Appeal.” We have only now to say,
that the document in extenso may be inserted in our pages as an ad-
vertisement, upon the usual charge.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Punch's PoliticAL DICTIONARY.
HANcellon (in Latin Cancellarius) means literally
\ one who sits at a door or window, like a money-
taker at a theatre; and, as the Chancellor's office
involves the duty of money-taking to a great extent,
it is, no doubt, the origin of the term. The Chan-
cellor of England was originally the KING's Secre-
tary, to answer his master's letters; a task which
entitled him to possession of the seal; but when
the Chancellor waxes disagreeable, the sovereign
takes his seal back again. His duties are pretty
generally known, and his salary is 10,000l. a year,
with an allowance of about four thousand more for
going out chairing, which he does during the session, as Chairman of
the House of Lords. He is keeper of the royal conscience, but this
has been a sinecure in some reigns.
CHANCELLon of THE ExchEquER. A kind of book-keeper for
the country at large, whose duty it is to make out the accounts of
the nation every year, and send them in to the House of Commons.
He is usually not much of an arithmetician, but is a great adept in
the practice of double entry into the public purse, for he dips into
it twice a year.
CHANceRY. A kind of judicial rat-trap or mouse-trap, which it is
very easy to glide into, but from which it is very difficult and often
impossible to recede.
CHILTERN HUNDREDs. A piece of land in Buckinghamshire,
formerly known as the Chiltern Hills. They afforded shelter to
banditti, and abounded in timber, which is the reason of their being
chosen as a retreat for those members of Parliament who wish to cut
their sticks. An M.P. who desires to resign his seat applies for the
stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds, which is a sinecure, like the
stewardship of one of the fourpenny steam-boats on the Thames.
| Some think that the Chiltern Hundreds is a ship, and that the
steward, being always compelled to remain aboard, has no time to
attend to his parliamentary duties, which he accordingly resigns.
| own hands.
CHIMNEY Swee PER. No longer a man, out a mere machine; for
the only chimney sweeper that is now allowed by law is the ramoneur.
The sweeps were formerly called vulgarly the clergy; but the
chimneys have lost the benefit of clergy since the passing of the act
prohibiting climbing-boys, as being unsuited to our clime.
CHURCHwan DEN. An officer who keeps the accounts of the
parish, and keeps them so strictly, as in the case of GIBBs, of St.
Stephen's, Walbrook, that he will not allow them to pass out of his
One of the duties of a Churchwarden is to perambulate

A DRAMATIC RELISH.
what a devilled turkey is to the insipidity of a turkey boiled, is the
subjoined plot of a drama to a drama of the dull old times. We take the
description from a Sunday print. It is deliciously peppered :—
“In, it (the Beggar's Petition) are exhibited a worthy English farmer losing his all,
and being ruined by the rapacity of his landlord, the seduction of the farmer's beautiful
. by the only son of the aforesaid landlord, a daughter falsely accusing her own
mother of a robbery, in order to save herself and child from being turned adrift, and dis-
carded by her seducer, a den of thieves, a burglary and highway robbery; the under-
plot being made up of the adventures of a saucy, wanton woman,” &c., &c.
There is but one thing wanting in this delicious drama : there is no
murder. Wanting blood, it is as the plum-pudding without the brandy.
Nevertheless, who shall say, with such pieces licensed by the Lord Cham-
berlain (since we must have a licenser), that he is not an admirable school-
master for the galleries?
Suburban Intelligence.
In consequence of the severe rains of the last week, the passage from the
Kensington Railway Terminus to the entrance of the Bush of the Shepherds
has become doubly dangerous. The mean quantity of mud has become
frightful in consequence of the mean conduct of the Paving Board. The
inhabitants complain of its being very hard, but we have dipped into it
and find it very soft. We understand that the Paving Committee refuse
to lay down flags unless they can meet with “the flag that braved a
thousand years the battle and the breeze.”

in that month that I became
persnally ecquaintid with my
Prins and my gracious Sova-

“Long before the hospitious

to the notus of my reveared Sovaring in a melintary coschewm. The Court-

—livries (ojous wud I 8 to put it down) I used to wear befor entering

course of formation to cut through the narrow neck of land known as the Isthmus of

for it is said to be neck or nothing with them all.
SCIENTIFIC INTELLIGENCE.
The Pharmaceutical Society held its first conversazione
this month.” The meeting was numerously attended.
The object that attracted most attention in the lecture-
room was a soda-water jug, the beauty of it consisting in
giving a gratuitous shower-bath to those standing opposite
when the liquid was discharged into a glass held at an angle
of 45°. At the conclusion of the meeting, the students
adjourned to the Laboratory.
MR. QUIDDY having called himself to the sand-bath,
ordered the attendant to produce the banquet, which con-
sisted of three carboys of punch a la laboratoire, a plum-
cake with a pestle and mortar in the centre, walnuts and
chloride of sodium, unlimited tobaccorine, the hydrate of
oxide of ethule being in the ascendant, protoxide of hydrogen
bearing an inverse ratio.
A distingué young man rose : he said he had heard the
term “Old Brick”frequently used that evening; he thought
the Latin Antiquas Taler more appropriate.
A Medical Student said he had a sentiment to propose,
though he was not generally sentimental ; it was one
which he knew they would respond to from the bottoms of
their glasses to the top of their voices; it was, “Lur-lur-li-
e-ty,” with variations.
A Comic Assistant then gave some Nigger. Melodies, using
the Lecture-room sounding-board as a banjo.
The Secretary's health having been drunk, he commenced
a sentimentally-tragic speech, which, after attending to for
twenty minutes, we cut, for the purpose of analysing the alloys
of Knocker Metal, and inquiring into the State of Health
of the Inspectors of Police in the surrounding neighbour-
A statistical account will be given in the next number of
the “Pharmaceutical” of how many craniums were above
the table at 11 P.M., and how many under it at 1,2,3,4 A.M.
ILLUSTRATED CIRCULARS.
The rage for illustration has reached such a ridiculous
height, that wine-merchants are sending out illustrated cir-
culars containing the price of Port on one side of the sheet
of paper, and a lithographed view of Oporto on the other.
We think this principle might be generally carried out, and
should suggest that a list of champagnes should be embel-
lished with a portrait of a gooseberry-bush ; while the
sketch of a policeman's cape might adorn that part of the
catalogue devoted to the Madeira. A panoramic view of
Bass's Straits might accompany a list of prices of Bass's
pale ale, and an allegoric representation of British Industry
in full play, would be very emblematic of the production
of brandy.
Railway Intelligence.
WE understand that the largest transactions in Scrip are
at present confined to the marine-store dealers, who have
lately taken up this branch of commerce with some alacrity.
The placards in their windows now announce, that the best
price is given for Capel Court stuff, as well as kitchen-stuff.
Instead of calling upon people to look up their old rags
and waste-paper, they are requested to look up their old
letters of allotment and useless Scrip, for which a liberal
amount will be given.
THE CHELSEA PENSIONERs.
It is with a feeling of the most acute commiseration,
that we have read an account of a review of the Chelsea
pensioners at Chatham. It is lamentable to think that men
who have gone to repose upon their laurels, should be
dragged out of their leafy beds to go through—with wheez-
ing, puffing, and blowing—those manoeuvres that they
formerly executed without an effort. England, if thrown
for support on to her wooden legs, must be considered to be
regularly stumped out of her resources.

Apollo put down so much hard cash, to be allowed to twangle his lyre.
The Herald defends the Poet, after its own wisdom, saying—
“We take it, that Ms. BuNN has as much right to play a work at an author's cost
** a bookseller has to publish one, for, in either case, the decision of the public settles
the question of prudence or folly—of profit or loss.”
Not so, good Grandmother. MR. BUNN has exclusive privileges granted

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HINTS TO INFORMERS.
|
ARLETs, I do not like you; quite the
reverse: but, scoundrels as you are,
you are entitled to justice, and I am
unwilling to see you oppressed. It is
necessary to set thieves to catch
thieves; and good faith should be kept,
even with a Queen's Evidence. As
long as your calling is a lawful one, you
have a right to pursue it unmolested;
and that you may do so, attend to the
advice I am about to give you. In
laying your informations be careful in
the selection of your victims. Choose
cabmen, or omnibus-men, whom you
may catch without their badges, or
racing, or driving furiously, or loiter-
ing and obstructing the streets. Sum-
mon costermongers for ill-treating their
donkeys. Pull up unlicensed hawkers.
Denounce Sabbath-breaking publicans,
cigar smugglers, and illicit distillers.
Bring to justice waggoners for riding on their shafts, and their masters
who have neglected to have their names painted on their vehicles.
Pounce upon all thimble-riggers, lottery-men, and keepers of low gambling-
houses. Drag all these base, plebeian offenders before the magistrate
without fear or scruple.
But beware, you rogues, how you inform against aristocratic gamblers,
and especially, how you sue noble and gentle black-legs. Are you aware,
you dogs, that the fellow, who, not long since, brought qui tam actions
against his betters for betting on horse-races, is now in Whitecross Street
Prison, on account of the costs which he incurred through one of those
actions, and for which Parliament, by a retrospective law, made him
liable Think how he is expiating his disrespect of persons; and if you
would avoid his fate, henceforth hawk at vulgar game.
Yours, contemptuously,
33&H$2CA3.
CYMON AND IPHIGENIA.
(Slightly altered from Dryden.)
“Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit, et artes
Intulit agresti Latlo.”—Horace.
“No sooner had we led away The captive Whigs from battle fray,
Than we, their Tory victors rude, Were by their charms in turn subdued:
'Twas thus, that reason first began To i. the agricultural man.”-&c., &c.
PEEL's FREE IMITATION.
“The Right Hon. Baronet continues to improve.”—ANsweh to Inquinies.
IN that blest isle, where Hudson keeps his court,
And all the bulls, and bears, and stags resort,
There grew a stripling of a wealthy race,
Who wanted neither worth, nor form, nor face :
But, as no gift of fortune is sincere,
Was only wanting in a judgment clear.
Learning, and parts, and industry he had,
But still his sight was lamentably bad :
Clouds from the brain still prejudiced his eye,
And partial mist obscured the mental sky.
His speech, though ample, had a rustic sound;
His eyes were fixed too firmly on the ground:
His corn and cattle seem'd his only care,
And his delight his butter, cheese, and beer.
“Bob,” he was called, which signifies a shilling;
And, to be good, he only wanted milling.
It happen'd, on a vacant Saturday, -
Forth to the fields he took his solemn way. -
His sliding-scale, too brittle for a staff,
Hung half before him, and behind him half:
He trudged along unknowing what he sought,
And whistled “Whigs awa'ſ "for want of thought.
The common places, and the beaten roads,
For once, he left, and walk'd among the woods;
There climb’d a hillock green, where trees were few,
And a rich prospect open'd on the view,
Where, far beneath, a mighty river flow'd,
And trade-fraught navies all at anchor rode.
Here, down beside a bubbling fount, was laid
(Like DIAN tired with sport) a sleeping maid;
The LADY LIBERA, the name she bore;
Robert and she had never met before. |
A wreath of corn her flowing tresses bound,
Now seeming fir’d—now free,_so loosely wound ;
(But pleased him most, when, with a breath of air
It changed its place, and slid along her hair;
Least, when by stealthy, smuggling breezes blown,
* It did the duty of a royal crown.)
Her white arms pointed, as she lay at rest,
One tow'rds the East, the other tow’rds the West;
As if she would o'er West and East convey
Her beauty's glory and her empire's sway.
“The swain stood looking with new-open'd eyes,
And gaping mouth, that testified surprise:
Then would have spoke, but by his glimmering sense
First found his want of words, and feared offence;
Doubted, for what he was he should be known,
By his farm accent and his country tone.
He would have waked her, but restrain’d his thought;
For love, new-born, the first good manners taught.
Love taught him shame, and shame, with love at strife,
Soon taught the sweet civilities of life.”
Thus reason in SIR Robert's soul grew big ;
This made him first suspect he was a whig ;
This made him feel his former self a bore ;
By this he found he wanted sense before;
That sense of want prepared the future way
To knowledge, and reform, and show'd the dawn of day.
At length awaking, LIBERA, the fair,
º her bright eyes, and saw him gazing there.
“What make you here, good fellow " said the maid :
Then Robert first his rustic voice essay’d ;
Proffer'd his hand—the hand she long denied—
Then took; though half ashamed of such a guide.
So, Robert, having led the lady home,
No more would to his old advisers roam,
But sought St. Stephen's house with better mind;
No longer to the farm would be confined ;
Though cut by calves, on bowing terms with bullocks,
As convert to sad doctrines of M'Culloch's,
Did for the farm as much, at lesser cost,
And showed the farmer in the statesman lost.
Such wonders had this lady's sight the pow'r
To work on him—and, since, on many more :
Her sudden beauty strikes into the heart,
When seen from some base parasites apart:
Both on the hero, did the fair prevail;
And also on the teller of the tale.
ENGINEERING BY INSTINCT.
He science of engineering, we perceive
by numerous advertisements, is to be
acquired for six guineas. At this rate,
we shall have “every man his own
engineer;” for no one who can qualify
himself to earn his two or three guineas
a day at so trifling a cost of money,
time, and trouble, will hesitate to avail
himself of the opportunity. We used
to think the writing-masters, like the
lady in the playin Hamlet, did “protest
too much" when they undertook to
instil penmanship into the head and
- hand of the pupil in half-a-dozen les-
sons ; but these offers to teach en-
gineering in about a week, appear to
us to be even more hazardous than the
bold propositions of the caligraphists.
T“Measuring for Fun, made Engineering in Earnest,” seems to be the
principle upon which a Railway Surveyor's education is completed in the
present day.
The Eunaway Directors.
The retreat of the Directors is still going on; and we can only compare
it to the celebrated running away of the Rifles after the breaking-up of the
Lines. Are the poor Stags to be left to go to the dogs The only cut-
tings with which the Railroad Committee-men now appear to trouble
themselves, is a general cutting away ! The Shareholders are singing:—
Oh dear, what can the matter be
This is a shocking affair;
They promised to bring out the Scrip at a premium,
Which now is worth nothing per share.

SYMPTOMS OF THE PANIC.
| THE panic appears to have reached
the Surveyors, who are beginning to
offer their scientific apparatus for sale
through the medium of small adver-
tisements. We continually see an-
nouncements in the papers of “a theo-
| dolite to be sold,” or “a level to be
had, cheap;” which is sometimes
specified, by way of further inducement,
|shortly to see the doors of the pawn-
veyors wheeling their theodolites into
the arms of their uncles, and cram-
spouts with fearful rapidity.
not be a bad speculation to put a few
pieces of wood together into odd shapes
and carry them to the pawnbrokers,
who, in their innocence of what engi-
| neering implements are like, might
lend a handsome price upon them. We
beg leave to put our various uncles on
their guard, for we are told the imposi-
tion is being extensively practised.
WARLIKE preparations.
PREPARATIONs for war are being
| quietly but effectually made. The re-
view of the Chelsea pensioners is not
the only measure of defence that has
been commenced. The fourpenny
| steam-boat captains have had a hint
from official quarters to keep up their
crews to the full complement of three
S 1 R p " men and a boy.
THE SUCCESSOR TO PEEL.
UR contemporary, the Spectator, informs us that
the official days of SIR. Robert PEEL are num-
bered, and that the QUEEN has already sent for
his successor, and tells us plainly that it knows
who that statesman is, although, for certain
reasons, it leaves his name to be conjectured.
Its reserve on this point is, however, quite
needless, since it has drawn his moral character,
so to speak, as large as life, so that the likeness
is as palpable to the meanest capacity as a
portrait in one of our large cuts would be, except
to that of the Standard. That character is, ac-
cording to the Spectator, an eclectic aggregate of
all the good qualities of every existing statesman and politician, with
MR. Pitt into the bargain.
Can there be a doubt, after this, as to what should constitute his
physical portraiture ? Breathes there the artist who would not at once
depict the Roman nose, the upcurling chin, the dorsal gibbosity—call it
not hunch, the abdominal plenitude, and the small, but shapely legs?
Lives there the limner who would not invest these proportions in the
ribboned cap, the gay Vandyked doublet, and hose of many colours, and
place in the hands of the figure the old familiar cudgel? And would it
then be necessary to inscribe under the picture that name which modesty
alone forbids us to mention ?:
There is an individual boasting the above attributes, who, we will say,
though perhaps we shouldn't, is, of all others, the man for the Premier-
ship. In addition to those recommendations with which the Spectator,
with a flattering personality, has invested him, the following, we are sure,
will be conceded to him even by his enemies. With an aspect wooden
under all circumstances, he possesses more than even O'Connell's
“matchless intrepidity of face,” which has rendered that person ipsis
Hibernicis Hibernior. Add to this such an amount of actual courage,
accompanied by an understanding so vigorous, that he is ignorant of
nothing but fear.
If it be said that a Prime Minister must be a puppet, we can assert
that he is the first puppet in the world. We could even rest his claims
to the office on his merits in that capacity alone. Is there a doubt
respecting his dexterity in trimming Look at his ribbons. Is there a
question of his astuteness? Consider the cleverness with which he
circumvents Jack Ketch. To say the least, does any one think that he
cannot resist circumstances till they are too strong for him, withhold
reforms till they are forced upon him, and abandon his policy in time to
prevent an insurrection ? All this he will adventure “with his poor
gentleman-like carcase to perform,” or to be thrashed on his own hump
with his own cudgel.
And who is he We would fain be modest—but let us not be mock-
modest. The truth is—and the Spectator knows it—that the successor
of SIR Robert PEEL will be, or at least ought to be, no other than Mr.
Punch.

THE DU ExE OF WELLINGTON AND THE CIGAR S.
THE General Order against smoking in the Army has occasioned a deep sensation in every mess-room
in the kingdom, and created such a panic in the Cigar Market, that good Cheroots were done at an
unusually low figure, and the Manillas were down at a penny, which had been com-
manding threehalfpence, with a fair sprinkling of buyers, for the last, eight months.
The cabbage-growers are in despair, for the young officers had been the chief consumers
of the hardy winter savoy; which must now be sold as food for the lower classes,
instead of being packed in ivory cases for mess-room tables, as the best Havannahs,
imported direct from Havannah by the Hammersmith 'bus.
As to the military themselves, meetings are being called in every regiment, to con-
sider whether the officers shall coolly submit to allow the Duke of WELLINGron to
put all their pipes out. The Duke of WELLINGroN has blown a cloud over the whole
of the army by his inconsiderate endeavour to banish the cigar from the mess-room.
The officers naturally ask what they are to do when they meet; for they are to
be restrained from boxing, wrestling, leap-frog, blind-man's-buff, as well as prohibited
from smoking, and they dread the possibility of being thrown upon their conversa-
tional resources, which must have a most dreary effect.
Under their present trying position we can offer no consolation to the inmates of
the barracks, except such as they may derive from taking it by turns to read Punch
aloud to the whole mess.
INFERNAL
“RESPECTED PUNCH,
“A KIND but injudicious relative having given to my eldest son (aged 9) the sum of
half-a-crown, the absurd urchin, instead of dropping it into his money-box, or laying
it out like a man in ginger-beer, lollipops, and parliament, walks off to an “intellec- º

pound of a windmill and a humming-top. The thing to the , romeco

and wound up precisely like a top. . The string being
smartly drawn away, it will rise from the pillar, revolving
as it goes with considerable velocity. The first experiment was made at
tea-time. For the first half-quarter of a second, I confess I was amused
at seeing the little machine twirl its way towards the ceiling. But that
&º amusement was instantaneously dissipated; for the wretched toy first chipped
... out a bit of the plaster, and then descending with great force impaled a
piece of buttered Yorkshire cake, in which it stood trembling for an instant as if deliberating what it
should do next ; after which it dropped slantingly into a hot cup of tea into which it inserted one of
its sails. The hot cup of tea, overbalanced by its additional contents, dripped off the table upon the
head of the youngest member of my family, who was harmlessly sitting on a low stool. Never, sir, did
I see such indications of malice in an inanimate thing, as in this dreadful little gimcrack.
“Immediately after this series of disasters, a young gentleman from the next door came to spend the
evening-a pompous little individual with a taste for chemistry, and a row of silvery buttons upon
a French gray jacket... After hearing the calamity, this pedantic young humbug said– oh! your
room was too small for the vertical direction, you should try the horizontal. Only think, Mr. Punch,
of such polysyllables from a youth of eleven. Well, he winds up the machine again, claps the base of
the pillar against his chest, and shoots the precious missile straight before him. Off it goes,—extin-
guishes both, the candles, leaving us in utter darkness, in the midst of which we hear a jingle and
a crash. When lights were brought in, I found that three tumblers had been swept off the sideboard.
Under the influence of momentary indignation, and forgetful of the usages of hospitality, I dealt my
visitor a sound box on the ear, and sent him bellowing home to his father. The result is, that my
next-door neighbour and myself, who were always on the best possible terms, being members of the
same Pissenting Chapel, and travellers in the same omnibus, are no longer on speaking terms, but
sit gaping at each other in gloomy silence all the way from Hackney to the Flower-pot.

principles, if indeed he had any at all.

PU N C H'S
PARLIAMENTARY REPORT.
PARLIAMENT having been prorogued until
Thursday, the 27th of November, it was
opened on the morning of that day, by the
housekeeper in person, who proceeded with
a firm step to the throne, and, after having
withdrawn the usual covering, dusted it
carefully for a few minutes. The house-
keeper then delivered the following speech
to an attendant.:-
“I say,
“I don't exactly know what time they
are coming, for they can't get on without
DENMAN, and as he's sitting in the Queen's
Bench, he's not expected much afore half
arter three.
“I’ll TELL You what,
“I think we'd better have everything
ready for’em when they come. There’ll only
be two or three on 'em, and the curtains
can't want dusting, for they were only done
the other day.”
The housekeeper, at the close of this
speech, withdrew, accompanied by the at-
tendant. At about a quarter-past three,
LoRDS WHARNcliffe and ABERDEEN en-
tered the house, when—
Load WHARNcliffe wished to know if
the Court of Queen's Bench was up yet.
LoRD ABERDEEN was not able to answer
that question. He had understood that a
certain noble Lord, who held a high posi-
tion in that Court—he meant the Court of
Queen's Bench—was to have met their
Lordships at a quarter-past three.
Lond WHARNCLIFFE. —No, half-past;
at least, he (Lond WHARNCLIFFE) had un-
derstood half-past. Their Lordships were
proceeding to discuss this question in a
desultory conversation when
LoRD DENMAN, entering the house,
observed that he had been listening to a
very long argument in the Queen's Bench,
from which he had only just got º
LoRD ABERDEEN.—Now, then, where's
the Commission ?
LoRD WHARNcLIFFE.-I had it here just
now ! Oh! here it is.
The Commission was then read by the
Clerk,and the House having been prorogued,
with the usual formalities, until Tuesday,
the 16th December, their Lordships wished
each other good afternoon, and the House
was adjourned.

POLITICAL RUMOUR.
It is whispered, in circles likely to be
well-informed, that the beadle of the Exeter
'Change Arcade has declared himself in
reference to the Corn-Law Question. He
is opposed to a fixed duty, which imposes
upon him the necessity of taking the ave-
rage, and sometimes much more than the
average, of chaff.

THE ROYAL
DEFAULTER.
It is with very great regret we have heard a rumour of the probability the artist to do a picture under the usual price. Such a domestic scene
of a distress for poor-rates being put into the Flemish farm of PRINCE
ALBERT. We are puzzled to conceive how this state of things can have
come about, for we know PRINCE AlBERT to be most economical in all his
arrangements, and very desirous of saving to the utmost extent in all his
personal expenditure. We trust that the tax-gatherer will not act preci-
pitately in this unfortunate business, but will give the Prince the usual
as that which we anticipate, would furnish a most adumirable theme for
the painter, and we should recommend it to the illustrated papers, as a
much better and more interesting subject than the great majority of those
which are presented to the public through the medium alluded to. We
have furnished a sketch which any of our pictorial contemporaries may
imitate. Before, however, quitting this subject, we may be allowed to express
- - APOLLO “PU NCH." TO THE ‘st ANDARD."
warning of some half dozen letters “on HER MAJESTY's service,” before a hope that His Royal Highness PRINCE ALBERT will not persevere in his
his goods are distrained upon. Should a man be actually put into posses- refusal to pay the rates, and thus bring himself into collision with the tax-
sion, and the Prince's goods be positively seized, the event would be a fine gatherer. We need only refer to the admirable example set by Hen
subject for an historical painting, which would probably be executed for MAJESTY, who, when the Income-tax was first imposed, paid her share of
the Prince upon very low terms, if he followed his usual course of plead- it like a trump, or rather like a Court Card, which may be considered an
ing the particular circumstances of the case as an argument to persuade honour to the Sovereign.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH's POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
IRCUITs. From the Latin word circuitus, round
about, which is very properly applied to law, for
it is of a round-about character. The judges
go the circuits twice a year, namely, in spring
and summer; but summary justice may be done
at the spring circuits. A very numerous bar
attends, and there is what is called a circuit
mess; but the Oxford and Western circuits got
themselves lately into a very terrible mess with
the newspapers.
CIT1zen. From the Latin ciris, the inhabi-
tant of a city. AR1stotle commences his third
book, by asking what is a citizen; a question
that the landlord of the London Tavern might perhaps give an
answer to.
Civil List. The money voted for the expenses of the Sovereign ;
and it is called the Civil List, probably from the civil manner in
which it is granted by Parliament.
- CLARENDoN, THE Constitutions of, were sixteen declaratory
ordinances aimed against the usurpation of the Pope, and it is sup-
posed by some antiquarians that they took their name from having
been settled by the nobles over a dinner given them by HENRY THE
SEcond at the Clarendon.
* CLIENT. Originally a person who having no possessions of his own
received a gift of land from a patrician or patron. In the present
day the relation is rather reversed, for the patron shows his patron-
age by getting all he can out of the client. By the law of Rome,
the patron succeeded to the property of any client who died without
heirs; but the English law generally fleeces the client in his lifetime,
so that the question of what is to become of his property after his
death perplexes nobody. The clients in former times always
attended their patron to any public place, but this custom is abolished
for it would be very inconvenient to the Attorney-General if, when
he walked about, he had some hundreds of clients dangling after him.
CoAL TRADE. See SLATEs. There is a poeticallegend that CUPID
was formerly in the coal and potato line, for we are told, on good
authority that “Young love lived once in an humble shed.”
CofFEE. A strong stimulant to political opinion, and, in conjunc-
tion with tea, is generally used to water the plant of freedom in its
growth at the meetings of the working classes. It is calculated that
it took several millions of pounds of coffee to carry the Reform Bill,
and on analysing a speech at one of the Temperance Halls, it was
found to contain six parts coffee, four parts sugar, two parts milk,
and eighty-eight parts water.
Colony. A place taken possession of by a foreign power, which
sends its subjects out to settle themselves, and sometimes to settle
the natives. Under the system that has been hitherto pursued, a
colony is to the mother country like an expensive establishment
kept at a distance for sending some of her children to.
CoMMIssion. A pretext for creating places and appointments to
add to the patronage of the Government.
CoM Mission. In the army, a purchasable distinction, an outward
sign of military merit that may be had by paying for. Thus, a
lieutenant who successfully leads a forlorn hope, will have a forlorn
hope of promotion, unless he can follow up the act of drawing his
sword upon the enemy, by drawing his check upon a banker.
CoMM on Law. The unwritten or customary law, being that part
of the law to which we have become reconciled by use, as the eels
are to the process of skinning. The Common Law is not good unless
it is founded on what no one can remember; and this accounts for
the lawyers being sometimes apt to forget themselves. SIR
MATHEw HALE says, the origin of the Common Law is as undis-
coverable as the head of the Nile; but, considering the blackness of
the subject, it would have been an apter simile to have said the
Niger.
PEAS versus POTATOES.
IN consequence of the elaborate paper of DR. Buckland, in which he
gives the palm to the pea, and smashes the potato all to atoms, we have
determined to try a few experiments with the two vegetables. Like
BRUMMELL, we “once ate a pea;” but, not remembering to have derived
any particular energy from the morsel, we were disposed to give the
preference to that vegetable with which, in his hand, SIR WALTER
RALEIGH has gone down to posterity.
A day or two ago we swallowed six peas, but we did not receive such an
accession of fibre and muscle as DR. BuckLAND had induced us to believe
that we should have done. We ran up and down stairs to try the experi-
ment, but soon grew fatigued. The next day we dined upon a potato,
which gave us considerable energy; but our legs were rather stiff, which
may be accounted for by the quantity of the starch which the potato is
known to contain.
We have read DR. Buckland's paper very attemively, and have
weighed his assertion as to the Nursery couplet being a proof of the
popularity of peas in the Fifteenth Century. We, however, do not take
the same view that he does of the distich, for if there was “Peas-pudding
in the pot nine days old" it is clear that our forefathers and foremothers |
were not very fond of it.
As to a feed of beans, which DR. BuckLAND recommends, we have not
tried it, for we are not quite such donkeys as to think of doing so.
DR. BUCKLAND tells us that the woman of Tutbury lived a long time
by sucking the starch out of her pocket-handkerchief. We cannot bring
ourselves to try the experiment, or we would some day make a dinner
off our shirt-collar, which has probably more starch in it than the woman
of Tutbury's pocket-handkerchief.
On the whole, after weighing peas, pocket-handkerchiefs, beans, collars,
and potatoes, we are inclined to give our verdict in favour of the latter.
WHIS PERS FOR THE WHIS PERING GALLERY.
The practice of making an exhibition of St. Paul's, by receiving fees,
has elicited, from an indignant visitor, the following whispers, for the
celebrated Whispering Gallery. We print them for the use of foreigners:
“This building is supported by involuntary contributions.”
“The admission is only fourpence, clergymen and children half price.”
“The tomb of England's greatest naval hero, two pence extra.”
“The Bishop expects every Englishman to pay the duty.”
“It has lately been white-washed, like the Ecclesiastical Commission,
at an enormous expense.”
“Candles are provided for the vaults, at a penny a piece.”
“The Showman has no salary, excepting what he receives from visitors.”
“Persons who are pleased with the exhibition are requested to recom-
mend it to those outside.”
“The Free List suspended, excepting for Members of the Royal Family.”
A Merry Christmas.
A few patriotic Poles, encouraged by the absence of the EMPERoR of
Russia, have been betrayed into a revolution on the borders of Prussia.
Nicholas, on being acquainted with this by messengers sent off expressly
by his brother autocrat, exclaimed, gaily, “Well, there's no place like
home !” He returns instantly to St. Petersburgh, to superintend the
approaching festivities.
A LIBERAL OFFER.
A GENTLEMAN advertises in the Times of Friday, for “a secretary, who
is to receive a hundred a year, and will be expected to have two
thousand pounds of his own ; one thousand of which are to be deposited
with his employer's banker, for purposes that are to be hereafterexplained.”
We have no objection to take fifty secretaries, on the same terms; and
request that any gentleman wishing to treat may send his thousand pounds
at once to the Punch Office.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHA
IWARI. 253
DEPOSITING THE PLANS.
3. 330 cm.
THE TRAIN–THE RIVALS-THE RACE-THE COLLISION
–THE ComPROMISE—THE ARRIVAL-THE SELL.
I. The Train.
BRING forth the train The train was brought: .
In truth 'twas very small indeed ;
Engine and tender, and for speed
One first-class carriage, and I thought
'Twas meant for me : but I was mad,
Mad as a hatter, when they taught
How that the rival line had bought
The only train that could be had ;
And 'twas in vain for me to pray,
Or offer any terms to pay.
They put his great-coat on his back ;
They shoved him in—that menial pack 1
His carpet bag inside they crammed,
The carriage-door was fiercely slammed ;
The plans and sections stowed inside,
“All right !” the eager stoker cried.
Out flew the steam with roar and crash;
Away !—away !—and on they dash :
'Twas more than rapid—it was rash.
II. The Defiance.
Away!—away !—the train was gone;
I had no means of getting on :
Town must be reached ere close of day,
Or all our toil be thrown away.
I caught a last glimpse of my foe's
Right thumb extended from his nose:
I heard a peal of savage laughter,
And madly rushed the engine after,
And howled back “Humbug | *—though, indeed,
Amidst the thundering engine's speed,
Perchance he did not hear nor heed.
But hark that whistle ! Yes! by gum,
It is another engine come !
'Tis hired; a bargain quickly made:
I dare not think how much I paid.
Loud roars the steam 1–round go the wheels 1
And I am on my rival's heels.
III. The Colliston,
Away !—away!—my plans and I;
We’re not more than ten-miles behind,
So for a crash I strung my mind—
I felt ’twas coming by-and-by.
The engineer upon the track
Looked out, and saw red lamps ahead ;
The engine 'twas too late to back,
So he jump'd off, and on we sped.
The steam roared on l—the wheels spun round !—
We seemed to fly along the ground.
Against one side my back I braced,
My feet against the other placed ;
I saw the lamps gleam bright before, -
I felt a shock—I heard a roar:
Stop —back her —ease her All in vain ;
We’ve run into the other train
IV. The Compromise.
My thoughts came back. Where was I? Spilt
And bruised and battered l But the foe
Was worse than I. It might be guilt
In me to serve a rival so :
I know not ; but this thing I know,
If he was smashed, it served him right:
And there we were, an awful sight—
I on the embankment, and my foe
Pitched slap into the ditch below.
His carriage I’d contrived to smash,
But spoilt my engine in the crash.
What's to be done? The day wears on—
Two precious hours already gone !
And so, lest both should be delayed,
A compromise perforce we made.
My carriage to his engine tied,
We journey, sulky, side by side. -
v. The Arrival.
Onward we went, but rather slow ;
In vain—the pace we could not go.
I had my rival in my power,
And thought to burke him in that hour;
But better thoughts prevailed.
Amalgamation then I tried ;
But very shortly he replied,
And all my efforts failed.
Down went the sun at half-past five,
In time we hardly may arrive—
I tried a last appeal.
I talked the driver from his funk,
And made the willing stoker drunk.
'Twas sad to see him reel
About the tender to and fro;
But still he made the engine go,
And that was all our need.
And faster, faster by degrees,
Thro' tunnels, past towers, towns and trees,
We flew at headlong speed;
In vain we urged him to refrain,
For still he stirred and stoked amain.
We swing, we swerve from left to right,
And thro' the darkness of the night
Our sparks fly far and wide—
Oh, never till that breathless hour,
I knew a drunken stoker's power
Over the folks inside l
Still on, still on we madly swept,
Till, at a turn, the engine leapt
At one spring from the line.
Thank Heaven it happened on a flat,
But as it was, I crushed my hat,
A bran new four-and-nine—
And there we stuck—knee-deep in mire.
We stormed, we swore, we stirred the fire—
But there we were in our despair,
And neither seemed a fig to care
About us or our plans :
With hunger and with bruises faint—
'Twould raise the dander of a saint,
| Much less a mortal man's 1
With grim resolve we sat us down,
(For we were thirty miles from town)
In hopeless certainty of mind–
| Even supposing we got there—
The Board of Trade shut up to find;
Oh, how we both did swear !
When sudden on the neighbouring road
A yellow with four posters showed;
Ours—ours that chaise must be l
We rush upon the frightened “boys.”
We knock them off, and, joy of joys |
Spring each to saddle-tree.
Ply, ply the whip, spare not the spur,
Along the Great North Road we skir,
The clocks are striking ten I
'Tis thirty miles in two short hours:
But in a holy cause like ours
Agents are more than men ;
So on, so on with plunge and bound,
Our wills are good, their wind is sound—
We’ll save our distance still.
But ah! despite our desperate pluck,
| Three quarters past eleven has struck
As we gain Highgate Hill
The leaders snort, the wheelers reel,
| And past the Peacock as we wheel,
Their breath comes short and thick :
A fall ! the leader's wind is broke
A cab a cab 'Tis past a joke
“This, if you do the trick 1"
I waved a flimsy in my hand.
On, through Fleet Street, along the Strand—
There's time the chance to nick ;
'Tis done—we’ve won, we've reached Whitehall!
But hark what sounds my ear appall
It is the Horse Guards' clock—
'Tis striking twelve—the hour is past:
Oh, heavy fate 1 sold, sold at last !
At twelve the gates they lock
And we are left outside the door
The standing orders to deplore.

PARLIAMENTARY CHEMISTRY.
onour.ABLE Members will be glad to hear that
an ingenious instrument has been constructed
for the purpose of ascertaining, scientifically,
the intensity of Parliamentary debates. It is
very simple, consisting merely of a vessel of
lime-water. This fluid has the power of ab-
sorbing carbonic acid gas, which gasis evolved
from the lungs in a proportion corresponding
to the rate of breathing. According to the
length and energy of the debate, will be the
quantity of carbonic acid given out by
Honourable Members. The lime-water, eva-
porated to dryness, will leave a residue of
carbonate of lime. By adding sulphuric acid
to the deposit, the carbonic acid gas will be
separated, and in that state may be collected
and measured, so as to indicate exactly the
amount of Parliamentary respiration per
night. Carbonate of lime, being in fact chalk, will furnish a regular score
against members; and perhaps an improvement of the apparatus will
express the precise quantity of breath spent, or, it may be, wasted, by each
member. We shall be anxious to know the results which it will furnish
as regards Lond BROUGHAM. The absorption of carbonic acid purifies the
air; so, that, besides the scientific value of this invention, it will prove
especially serviceable in the House of Commons.
Improvements in Bribery.
A New kind of bribery has lately sprung up. The “apples with the
silver pips” have been discontinued by the omnibus conductors, since
the trading in them was exposed in our pages. The bribe is now offered
in a snuff-box. The conductor, who has tarried at the omnibus-station
longer than he is allowed by act of Parliament, calls out to the vigilant
guardian of the peace, “I say, policeman, have a pinch of snuff " Z33
accepts the offer, and finds amongst the rappee a sixpence, which his
instinct tells him is not to be sneezed at, and so it is applied to his pocket,
instead of his nose. A sixpenny pinch will secure the owner of the
snuff-box, an indulgence of five minutes, whilst a shilling ditto will so far
obscure the vision of the wide-awake policeman, as to make him blind to
the stationary omnibus for the next quarter of an hour. The snuff is
known amongst the cads, as the “Policeman's Mixture.”
-
THE WORACIOUS ALDERMEN.
i
!.
HERE is no doubt that an Alderman is an Alderman, all
the world over; and put him where you will, “the
love of the turtle,” which is so touchingly alluded to
by BYRON, will be the characteristic of the class
alluded to.
It appears from the following paragraph in the
Leeds Mercury, that a Leeds Alderman is, in every-
thing which marks the peculiarity of the Aldermanic
character, quite on a par with a Member of the
London Corporation :-
“Before he sat down, Ma. Lurton alluded to the great inter-
ruption occasioned in the transaction of business, by members
of the Council retiring at various times to lunch or dine ; and,
to obviate this inconvenience, he suggested that the gentlemen
on the Aldermanic Bench should in succession, at the Council
meetings, provide refreshment in the witness-room for the
members of the Council. (Hear, hear.) As one of the junior
Aldermen, he had provided a bowl of soup and other refresh-
ments, of which he invited the members of the Council to
partake. (Applause )
“The Council here retired for twenty minutes into the
witness and grand jury rooms, and there partook of the refresh-
ment provided. On their return to the Council chambers, the
business was proceeded with.”
Here we find the entire civic business of Leeds
continually interrupted by the appetites of the Alder-
men, who are constantly running out to their luncheons
and dinners. Fancy Lond DENMAN being unable to
sit five minutes quiet in the Queen's Bench without
scampering off to FENDALL's Coffee House, or BARON
ALDERson rushing out of the Exchequer to clutch an
occasional sandwich from the stall of the old woman
who sits in the vestibule. Imagine WiGRAM always
of ox-tail concealed on the little shelf where he keeps
his cases ready cut and dried to meet every possible
argument.
We believe that the judges are allowed portable
soup, a piece of which, the size of a nut, is said to
dissolve into a whole basinful directly it is put into
the mouth ; but this is nothing to the inconvenience
that would be occasioned by their Lordships' running
in and out of their Courts for something to eat, like
the Leeds Aldermen.
It was a liberal idea of MR. Lupton, a junior
Alderman, to provide (a bowl of soup in the ante-
room; but the amnouncement of the luscious potage
being within reach, had the effect of clearing the
Court, and causing a temporary suspension of busi-
ness. When, however, they had all souped, the
affairs on which they had met were proceeded
with.
—
THE PRICE OF SPLENDOUR.
The following advertisement appeared a few days ago in the daily
newspapers:—
ORD MAYOR'S DAY.-The Committee for conducting the enter-
1 tainment at Guildhall on Lord Mayor's Day request all persons having any
DEMAND for the PROCESSION or BANQUET, will, on or before Wednesday, the
26th Nov.instant, send the particulars of their claims to me, under cover to the Hall-
keeper, Guildhall, in order that the same may be examined and discharged.
JOHN WOOD, Secretary.
We understand that among the bills sent in was one from the Man in
Brass, who charged a guinea for bearing the weight of his armour, and
another guinea for the much greater burden of being compared to ALDER-
MAN GIBBs. One of the items in the poor fellow's little account ran as
follows:–
“To six jokes, cut at my expense, between Blackfriars Bridge and
Guildhall, &c., two shillings and sixpence.”
The Band sent in its bill, with a separate charge for each tune, and the
account included six polkas, at fourpence a piece; half an overture, at
threepence; and forty-eight quadrilles, at sevenpence-halfpenny per dozen.
PUSHED FOR AN ExCUSE.
GREAT complaints have been made that Sunday was selected by
Government as the last day for receiving the Railway Plans. The excuse
given at the Board of Trade is, “the better the day, the better the Deed.”

THE SURVEYOR'S RETURN.
FAINT and wearily the way-worn Surveyor returns to the bosom of his
family. He has finished his railroad labours, and they have nearly
finished him. Six months ago he went forth, erect, elate, plump, rubi-
cund; even as a boxer trained for the fight. Elastic was his step; his
air was jaunty. Tight was the fit of his shooting-jacket; and sprucely did he
look in it—for it was new. Unworn were the highlows which he marched
along in, shouldering his theodolite, or brandishing his trusty level. Behold
him now ! His head droops, his form is angular, his cheek is sallow ; he
is like unto a pauper newly emancipated from the workhouse. Six months
—six calendar months—at Brixton could not have brought him thus low.
Loose are his garments; patched also, and shabby; and low as his con-
dition are the heels of his boots. His level peeps timidly from his hinder
pocket, and he trails his theodolite on the ground.

Will he be recognised by that family to whose bosom he is creeping?
Will his wife and children hail the altered man Or rather will not his
domestic shut the door in his face, and tell him there is nothing for him t
Surveyor, let thy knock be loud and double, lest thou be repulsed as a
mendicant. And, Surveyor, a word in thine ear: Thou hast accomplished
thy work; and the labourer is worthy of his hire. We would advise
thee as a friend—a familiar friend—to look sharp after thine. Make out
thy account speedily; send in thy bill with all despatch, while yet the
bubble is roseate, and the JEREMIEs who blew it, whose surname is
DIDDLER, yet linger in the land of the solvent; and ere, borne far away
o'er the broad Atlantic, the rogues of the railways have sought the realm
of the Repudiator. ,
• COLONEL MABERLEY'S STUD.
LL the Post-Office horses look thinner and thin-
ner. We have ascertained that this is in conse-
quence of the dreadful hard work they had
tional streets imposed upon them have broken
the strongest frames. The Holborn Circuit
Hill, whilst one old horse, who had been
twenty years in the service of St. Martin's-
le-Grand, is reduced to such a skeleton
that every time he passes a black-doll shop, he shivers violently all
over, as his eye catches the announcement, “Best price given for old
bones.”. His rider is closely watched, as it is strongly suspected the
temptation will eventually be too much for him, and that he will back his
emaciated steed into the shop some fine foggy day, and sell him over the
counter for what he will fetch. We are glad to state, however, that three
wisps of hay and a pail of gruel have been ordered to be added to the
x. i.” of the whole stud, till each unfortunate horse has regained
a little flesh.
-
Isight and Magnetism.
PaoFEssoR FARADAY, of the Royal Society, has lately made a wonderful
discovery in the shape of magnetising a ray of light. The only import-
ance attached to this phenomenon is, we presume, the suspension of iron
filings to the magnetised ray. The next thing we may anticipate from
some member of this learned body will be the mesmerising of a flash of
lightning, and placing it in a cataleptic state whilst in the atmosphere and
on its passage to the earth; so as to render impossible all injurious effects
from that electric phenomenon.
VERY PALPABLE,
A coRREspondent of the Mining Journal states that he has “written
in a book the leaves and binding of which were made of iron.” There
is no doubt but the man is a Poor-Law Commissioner.
CLOSING OF THE SEAL OFFICE.
THE legal antiquarian will learn with regret that the doom of the Seal
Office is sealed. The desk of PIMLott is to share the common lot, and

But away with useless recollections: the Seal Office is a thing of the

Shortly will be publisbed a new Work, beautifully done up, to be
called “The Retreat of the Ten Thousand Directors.” The motto of
the work is “Sauve Qui Peut,” and we hear it is to be dedicated to the

latter takes a copy, the circulation will be immense.
LAMENTABLE DESTITUTION.
THE announcement that Ministers intend to repeal the Corn-laws has
quite disconcerted LoRD John Russell, who made sure that his late
missive to the Electors of London would be a letter of introduction to
office. We hear that it is the intention of the noble Lord, as soon as
Parliament opens, to accuse SIR Robert PEEL of “having taken the bread
out of his mouth.”

ROYAL PRETTY BOOKS.
EcENTLY we have heard that our
old friends the Man of To-
&c., &c.," have been ex-
cluded from the Most
Gracious School-room, to
make room for an entirely
new class of picture-books,
containing short-rhymed
lessonsin history, taste, and
morality, calculated to in-
struct as well as amuse the
Royal Infants, and forming
altogether a Juvenile Li-
brary, on a most successful
plan. Of these excellent
Didactic Poems, the follow-
ing are a few specimens:–
THE OLD. Broovi on St.
stephen's
The RE was an old Broom
of St. Stephen's,
That set all at sixes and
sevens;
And to sweep from the
room
The convictions of
BRough AM
Was the work of this Broom
of St. Stephen's.
THE OLD son or The Gun.
There was an old Son of
the Gun,
Who bushels of battles had
won;
“Ho! bring me my boots :
The cigars and cheroots
Have rebell'd l’” said this Son of the Gun.
The old Beggan of Dublin.
There is an old Beggar of Dublin,
Who is always the passengers troubling :
He tells shocking stories,
And a very great bore is
This sad Impostor of Dublin.
THE GREAT Poet of DRURY.
There was a great Poet of Drury,
Who massacred sense in his fury;
With a figure of fun,
Like a twopenny Bunn,
And the grandeur of Herod of Jewry.
The New singen of ITALY.
There was a new Singer of Italy,
Who went through his part very prettily;
“Mamma tinks him so fine,
We most have him to dine!”
Papa remark'd slily and wittily.
THE OLD singen of Avon.
There was an old Singer of Avon,
Who, Aunty Bess thought was a brave one;
But Mamma doesn’t care
For this stupid Swan's air,
Any more than the croak of a raven.
* To those readers who have forgotten these friends of their youth, and are compelled
to ask “where are they?" Echo shall reply by producing one of the oldest:-
“The old Max or Tobago.
“There was an old Man of Tobago,
Long lived on rice, sugar, and sago;

POLICEMEN, SERVANTS, AND FAMILIES.
He eyes of France were opened by M. MICHELET,
in his eloquent and startling work entitled “Priests,
Women, and Families,” to the machinations of the
Jesuits, and to the mischief occasioned by their
influence in private life. A Michelºr is very much
wanted in this country, to awaken Englishmen to
the tricks and manoeuvres of another fratermity
not less destructive of domestic happiness than
those of Jesuitism.—We allude to the Metropo-
litan constabulary; and, objectionable as may be
the Order of Ignatius Loyola, perhaps it is not
more so than that of Robertus PEEL.
This Society was ostensibly instituted for the
preservation of the peace; by quelling disturbances
putting down apple-women, apprehending pick-
pockets, removing obstructions, and taking beggars and disorderly persons
to the station-house. Its real object has at last become apparent, being no
other than universal domination. Its members, disguised in plain clothes,
are now known to mixin all societies, to whose manners and peculiarities
they are instructed to adapt themselves. They mingle, as exquisites, in
the salons of fashion; they creep, as cads, into the “crib" of the coster-
monger. They frequent every species of tavern, from the first-rate Hotel
to the Jerry-shop; and neither the freedom of the tap nor the sanctity of
the parlour is safe from their intrusion. They thus insidiously worm
themselves into all sorts of secrets, and ascertain who is who, what is what,
and what is going on; to the utter subversion of all privileges of Britons.
But the evil does not stop here. In his uniform the Policemanºis
notorious for scraping acquaintance with servants at area-railings.
what if the joint that went down only half finished re-appears three
quarters gone, and the fowl removed with one wing comes up minus
the remaining one What if his tea and sugar go with railroad rapidity,
his butter melts in the coldest weather, and his beer wastes without a
leak in the barrel How much longer are free-born Englishmen to
submit to the espionnage, and to be victimised by the voracity of an
X 10, a Y 15, or a Z20
“LITTLE HAVE, LITTLE VENTURE.”
The Editress of the standard, wishing to support an indignant state-
ment she makes, foolishly says, “We will stake our reputation on its
truth.” If Mas. HARRIs never plays for larger stakes than this, her
worst enemy could not accuse her of gambling.

LEADER AND LEANDER.
“Loan Brough AM IN FRANcz.—We are informed by the Courrier de Marseilles
that the diurnal life led by the ex-Chancellor of England, in the midst of the little Bri-
tish colony which has been established at Hieres, is remarkable for its simplicity. Every
morning is devoted to the solution of the most difficult problems of pure mathematics;
in the #. Lond Brough AM swims to his friend and neighbour, M.R. LEADER,
M.P., where, to unbend his mind from the study of the pure analysis, he demands a few
inspirations, somewhat less serious, from the panatellas. When the noble Lord is sur-
prised by nightfall in the midst of his conversations, he is too happy to avail himself of
the hospitality of his friend the Member for Westminster.”
THE wind was high on Hieres' wave,
When, o'er that stormy piece of water,
Swam, fearless of an aqueous grave,
“The young, the beautiful, the brave,”
Like him who courted Sestos’ daughter.
Ah! little—o'er the fish-pond's swell,
Whilst rung the distant dinner bell,
Reck'd HENRY of the spasm or cramp,
Or rheumatiz from cold and damp,
Though urchins raised, in French, the shout,
“Hoy! does your mother know you’re out !”
Though cries of “boat and drags for BRough AM 1”
And shrieking females warn'd him home,
To all he turn'd unheeding ears,
As to the clamours of his Peers.
He thought but of the roast and boil'd,
And only hoped they'd not be spoil'd;
His ears but rung with LEADER's song,
“Oh, keep not dinner waiting long !”
THE MANCHESTER GEOLOGISTS.
RoM what we learn in a local paper,
Manchester has been in a state of
excitement from one end to the other,
in consequence of the discovery of a
block of millstone-grit, with three foot-
prints in it. This extraordinary phe-
nomenon brought together a number
of M.P.s., Honourables, Reverends,
and others, to look at the block, that
each might put his own construction
upon it.
A DR. BLAck read a paper on the
subject, in which he suggested that the
- footsteps were made by a man or a
bird; but as birds do not wear boots, and the footstep was a good deal
like the print of a stout boy's highlow, we incline to the notion that
some boy—rather than some bird—had put his foot in it.
The Chairman, SIR PHILIP DE GREY WALPERs EGERTON, Bart., did not
like to give way to first impressions, and discarded the idea of their being
made by highlows, for the highlow always sunk into the mud altogether.
MR. WILLIAMson thought the footmarks had been made by an iceberg;
but as icebergs cannot walk, this suggestion was met by mental ejacu-
lations of “Walker!” -
MR. JAMES HEywood quoted DR. BUCKLAND, to show that it might have
been a tortoise taking a stroll ; for he had allowed a tortoise to indulge in
a promenade over an unbaked pie-crust, and the marks left were exactly
the same as those now under their observation. -
The Very Reverend the Dean had a strong notion that the footsteps
were made by something that dropped from the skies, for there were no
prints showing that the creature had either come or gone away again, in
the ordinary manner. Besides, if it was a foot-print, it was not that of a
naked foot; so that, unless they put the boot on the other leg, they were
as much in the dark as ever.
Some other speakers followed on the same side; a few went zig-zag
about on all sides ; others floundered between both sides ; and the meet-
ing broke up.
We shall have much pleasure in submitting to these gentlemen a small
patch of mud, with an impression of a Wellington boot, made by our-
selves the other * in the dark, for want of a gas light opposite to our
own residence. . If it can throw any illumination over the obscurity in
which the Manchester antiquarians are involved, they are welcome to the
footmark-mud and all—to make what they can of it.
THE DEPOSITS WITH THE BOARD OF TRADE.
THE scene on the last day for depositing the Railway plans with the
Board of Trade, is described by an eye-witness as one of the most fearful
things that was ever witnessed in a civilised country. Parliament Street
was strewed with exhausted engineers, who had just succeeded in lodging
their plans, and had sat down on the door-steps in the neighbourhood for
a little repose after the excitement of the last four months. Several
respectable Solicitors were lying along the pavement in a state of pros-
tration, and we observed an entire firm, which stands high in the Law-
List, snatching a little sleep under the friendly shelter of a gas-lamp.
This was the state of those who had been successful in getting their plans
all in by the proper time ; but the excitement of those who arrived after
the doors of the Board of Trade were closed was literally harrowing.
At one time it was feared that the offices of the Board of Trade would
have been levelled to the earth; for directly after the clock struck twelve
there was a shower of sections, maps, plans, and drawings thrown at the
doors and windows with a crash that was really terrific. The portal having
been temporarily opened, the unhappy porter was instantly smothered in
paper and parchment, which broke the passage lamp, and left the unfor-
tunate menial struggling for breath amid the pile of stationery which
enveloped him. Fortunately, the door was quickly closed, and some of
the other servants having removed some of the plans and sections, the
poor fellow was extricated from his perilous position.
Several cab-horses fainted away, and one of New MAN's cleverest hacks
went off into violent hysterics on reaching the Board of Trade, just before
midnight. -
wise Precaution.
THE winter is advancing, and the French newspapers contain no accounts
of the death, or capture, of ABD-El-KADER. Louis-PHILIPPE has given
orders to have the Marseilles telegraph immediately broken, and its
offices are to be superseded by Monsieur THIERs, who will have an
appointment at Algiers, so that there may be no delay for the future in
the transmission of the French victories.

JOHN JONES'S REMONSTRANCE ABOUT THE
BUCKINGHAM BUSINESS.
MY DEAR PUNCH,-Although it is not
probable that in the present juncture the
PUNCH-BuckingHAM dispute will be an object
of very great interest with the nation, yet as
you ask Mas. Jones's opinion, and my own, with
regard to the business, I shall frankly state that
I think you are wrong and BUCKINGHAM right.
“Far from complaining of BuckingHAM for
establishing the Institute, I like him for his
success. I would not go to a party. It would
be a bore, and dear. But there is only so much
the more merit in this gentleman, who has got
a great number of worthy persons to believe
that it is cheap, and that they really like it :
who has got their money out of their pockets:
who has got Earls and Lords to patronize him : who has got that good-
natured Duke of CAMBRIDGE to come and dine, and honest country folks
to rally round him : who has got a famous comfortable house for himself
and family, a comfortable maintenance for life, as he hopes; a reputable
SIMPson-status:—and all this is to be knocked over by Punch, the ruthless
batoneer | Ah! my dear Sir, you were too hard in this. Even supposing for
a moment, which of course I do not, that the Destitute is a humbug—is it
not a kindly and harmless one : The people who pay can afford their money.
What call had you to disturb them, or poor BuckinghAM? I do not think,
to judge from his writings, that Nature has endowed that gentleman with
a sense of humour; but even supposing he possessed it, and could see as
well as yourself, dear Mr. Punch, the admirable ridiculousness of the
whole Institute scheme, he would hardly sympathise with any jokes made
at the expense of it—at the expense of his bed and board—at the expense
of his lodging—at the expense of his future chances of comfortable main-
tenance, and of that delightful position which he holds as a Centre of
Civilization. ‘There's a fascination about that man, Sir,” I once heard
an East India Colonel say of MR. BuckINGHAM, “which is perfectly irre-
sistible. His eloquence is the most winning : his knowledge the most
prodigious: he has been everywhere and knows everything !' Hundreds
of respectable people, I trust, have this opinion. You may not hold it—
you might be bored by that flux of words which he can pour out in omne
avum volubilis to the astonishment of rustics —you may think him a
Brummagem Ulysses—but respect the men who differ from you. Have
you not met people in society who admired Mr. J. GRANT as a writer,
BUNN as a poet, &c. At an evening party at our parson's there was a
young lady crying at ‘other lips and other hearts' only three days since.
Surely, any one of these gentlemen will naturally be angry if found out
and pronounced to be an impostor.
“BuckINGHAM is so angered. He speaks after his fashion. He bawls
out rogue, forger, impostor. He says you are a malignant attack—a
disgusting exhibition, that nobody will be safe from you without buying a
dishonourable silence, &c.—and at this you become virtuously indignant
At page 241, you are absolutely serious. That page of Punch is a take
in. Punch ought never to be virtuously indignant or absolutely serious.
His two great, blundering, roaring, stupid enemies, in the show, the Police-
man and the Beadle, are always calling him thief, rascal, and knave.
Punch's good humour is never interrupted. Let us have a fair division
of labour; you do the laughing part, and BuckinghAM the] angry part.
He does not know how to laugh, so leave him his old, only weapon.
“He says you have a design on the Throne, that the Altar is not sacred
from you ; that the Brightest Pattern of Domestic Purity is assailed by
you, &c., &c. In the same way a kindred genius (the Standard) fell foul
of a caricature of yours the other day, that was construed into an assault
on the throne, which was only meant as a satire upon flunkeydom ; and
the old Standard has been bawling high-treason ever since.
“Ought this clumsy rage and stupid obloquy to disturb my hunch-
backed martyr Ought you to be angry because Dulness can't take a
joke P Regard the long-eared animal to which he has been compared.
#. prefers a thistle to a peach. To express his griefs or joys, his loves
or anger, he has but his heehaw, and brays softly or loudly as nature
prompts him. When he liſts up his voice, other far-off donkeys catch up
the strain, and echo the peal.
“So I see some “admirers of the Standard at Stoke Pogis,” or some
friends at Hookem Snivy are beginning to join the concert, and write
abusive notices, poems, and so forth, about Punch. It is a compliment
to my dear Punch, that emotion amongst the long-eared choristers.
“Recurring to MR. BuckinghAM and his second edition. Let me trust
that you are not going, for one minute, to be betrayed into an unnatural
seriousness by this second or by any future editions. 4 I see it is published
for the benefit of the Society of Foreigners. I wish they may get it—that
benefit. Only a great and wise philanthropist could have conceived such
a plan for relieving them this cold Christmas weather. I, for my part, have
read the pamphlet with unfeigned wonder and pleasure. It contains many
astonishing statements and ingenious reasonings. I was not aware of the
services of this eminent man until he himself stated them. Among his
‘projects’ for the good of others, which have involved BucKINGHAM him-
self in severe pecuniary loss, I see marked—
“‘ 7. Free Trade for Englishmen in China .
8. Opening of the Overland Route to India
9. Immediate Emancipation of British Slaves . Accomplished.
11. Providing Public Baths for the People . Accomplished.
12. Opening Public Walks and Gardens for the
8ame - - - - : - . Accomplished.
16. Abolition of Impressment for the Navy . . Accomplished.
20. Voyage of Civilisation and Discovery . . Not begun.”
. Accomplished.
. Accomplished.
* With the latter scheme alone I was acquainted. I did not know that
the former projects were owing to this great man. I should as soon have
expected to behold written–
“21. Magna Charta and the Fire of London . . Accomplished.
22. Circulation of the Blood and the Use of the
Long Bow . - - - - . . Accomplished.
23. Inoculation for the Small-Pox and Passage
of the Pons Asinorum - - . . . . Accomplished.
24. The Art of Printing by Moveable Types and the
Conflagration of the Thames river - -
25. The Battle of Waterloo and the Invention of
Steam-carriages on Iron-roads . - . Accomplished.
26. The new Process of Oval Suction (with the aid
of the spirited conductors of the Morning
Herald) . . . . . . . Accomplished.
“I should as soon have believed BUCKINGHAM to be the author of these
as of the other events above, but that we have here the positive statement of
this Prodigious Benefactor of Mankind recorded. Ought not the Foreigners
in Distress to be thankful, that such a fellow has taken them up 1 The
rogues will be in their coaches before long, and you, my dear, dear Punch,
cease laughing at so good, eminent, venerable, and truth-telling man.
Subjects there are too serious to joke about. Respect the Altar, the
Throne, and BUCKINGHAM—or a man who can do so much may rise
in his might and be the death of you; and some edition of this great
pamphlet may come out with an extra list of services, such as–
“21. Abolition of Punch, and End of the World . Accomplished.
22. Voyage of Civilisation, &c. . - - . . AccomplishED.
“Mind, I say, dear Punch, how you treat him, and let the British
Benefactor of the Foreign Destitute alone.
“With MRs. Jones's compliments,
“Believe me, dear Sir, yours,
“John Jones.”
Accomplished.
“P.S. With regard to the charge of extortion brought against you,
I confess I don't think it is quite “accomplished, as B. says. You told
him, he says, he might have the whole reply inserted in your columns
if he would PAY FoR IT as an advertisement at Your Usual CHARGE. “And if
this is not extortion, he says, “it is difficult to say what is.’ He has
you as he fancies. You are supposed to be done for.
“This logic may do with the Foreign Destitute, but not in Fleet Street.
The atrocious act of extortion took place after he had made the charge—
and is it not avery cruel one? Moses has to pay, though you have laughed
at that venerable person. I presume WARREN would have to pay, though
you had cut jokes upon his blacking : in a word, that any quack who
wished to advertise his ware would be no better off in this respect than
BuckINGHAM. If this is the only charge the Destitute's friend can brin
against you, you are not very much hurt I think. Giant as he is, an
inflamed by tremendous wrath, if this is the only blow he can hit, I think
you can manage to survive it.
“And, finally, with respect to Edition Three, in which BuckINGHAM states
that he offered to go as far as five guineas to get his Pamphlet-Manifesto
inserted in the body of your paper—and not in the advertisements I
think it was a diº and ingenious proposal, which was made to tell
against you either way. Had you accepted, you would certainly have
been guilty of accepting a gross bribe: (as you refused, out comes BUCK-
INGHAM with Edition Three, and a little supplemental reviling.: I have no
doubt he wished you to accept ; but BuckingHAM must know pretty well
by this time that PUNCH is not base, nor sordid, nor a fool.”
The Man at the Helm,
It is a remarkable fact that the Fairy steam-boat, which took the late
ministers to and from the Isle of Wight, was also employed to convey
LoRD John Russell to Osborne House, for the purpose of seeing Her
MAJESTY. The weather being rather boisterous, the captain advised
LoRD John Russell to lie down, as SIR Robert PEEL had done. “Ay,
ay,” exclaimed little John, “SIR Robert's berth will just suit me, so
I'll at once turn into it.”

Mrs. Harris, “So it is, my dear; and as for that, nasty, hojus Punch, I’m dispoged to scratch is hi's
out a'most. What I ses, I ses; and what I ses, I sticks to.”
A LITTLE B 17ſ of so ANDA1.
THE MINISTERIAL CRISIS.
It was very generally rumoured, and
very readily believed, that on the resig-
nation of the Cabinet, HER MAJESTY
immediately sent for Punch, who was
honoured with a carte blanche to form
a Ministry. The great stumbling-block,
however, was the ALBERT hat, to which
Punch declared his determination not
to pledge himself.
In the course of the interview, the
QUEEN suggested the difficulty of find-
ing a Chancellor, which Punch imme-
diately got over, by proposing to put
the seal into a very extensive commis-
sion, which would gratify the ambition
of several juniors, who have made up
their minds to sit upon the woolsack.
#| Punch's particular friend, MR. BRIEF-
#|LESS, is having a glass case made, in
which he proposes to keep the royal
conscience, should it be committed to
his care. It was proposed by Punch
to select the Minister for Forei
Affairs from the members of the
Dramatic Authors’ Society.
QUITE UNNECESSARY.
* We see it announced that “the con-
sideration of the Railway Termini, in
the City, is postponed.” We had
thought that the panic had settled that
question.
SOME ACCOUNT OF MRS. HARRIS.
*Constrºnable doubts prevailing as to whether there is any such person
as MRs. HARRIs, we deem it an act of justice to that lady to declare that
she is a real individual, and not like the dragon, a fabulous creature,
although d of many attributes which legends ascribe to the
dragon. #. ARRIs is an aged female, and is the mistress of a concern
called the Standard. Her habiliments, by no means either of the newest
or the cleanest, are chiefly remarkable for their latitude ; in which respect
they are similar to her tongue. . Like her friend, MRs. GAMP, the subject
of our memoir always carries about with her an umbrella, and is con-
stantly tº: it in somebody's face. She wears pattens; a precaution
which the nature of her walks renders very necessary; but which are
constantly tripping her º : when she is apt to pull them off and fling
them at the head of anybody who laughs at her, invariably, however,
missing her aim. , Hence it will be surmised, with truth, that the temper,
of Mrs. HARRIs is hasty ; indeed, but for the respect due to age, wé
should be justified in designating her a beldam.
Mrs. HARRIs, when irritated, is by no means choice in her language;
using, in fact, the simple Saxon] of Billingsgate. Otherwise addicted to
circumlocution, Mrs. HARRIs is concise in abuse.—The perceptions of Mrs.
HARRIs are limited. Hence she is very apt to make ſudicrous blunders.
Her pertinacity is intense ; wherefore, when she finds herself in the wron
she persists in it, telling nobody to talk to her, for she knows better, .#
won't hear a word. The old lady is very bigoted and intolerant, and eaten
up with a fanaticism, which she mistakes for piety. The loyalty of this
“blessed woman" is of a piece with her devotion; apparently a kind of
tipsy sentiment. In its paroxysms she becomes incoherent, and raves of
nailing her flag to a mast, but has never been known to do more than tie
her pocket-handkerchief to her umbrella. -
The voice of the ration.
Manshal. Bugeaud is evidently doing his best to get proclaimed King
of Algiers, for, by the slaughtering way he is going to work, there is not
the slightest doubt the Arabs will eventually elect i. as if they were one
man.
Amusing Accident.
The Echº, in JultiRN's Navy Quadrilles, was seized last week with a
dreadful cold. When it came to his turn to answer, the only response
the Echo made was a tremendous sneeze.
A NEW SENNACHERIB.
Sir Robert came down on the Corn-laws so bold,
And his backers felt savage, and sorry, and sold;
But the PREMIER of votes had a majority,
Amounting, in all, to about ninety-three.
As sheep follow the wether, submissive and mean,
That host at the heels of their leader were seen;
As sheep scatter wide when you leave them alone,
That host, says the Times, are now broke and o'erthrown.
For the Iron Duke set his fate on the cast,
And nailed, for the Corn-laws, his # to the mast ;
And the Cabinet's hopes felt a sensible chill, -
When they thought of the Duke, and his potent “I will.”
And there sat the PREMIER, his head on one side ;
His arguments pooh-poohed, his statements denied ;
And tho' he tried hard, he had need of his nerve,
A decent composure of face to preserve.
And there sat grim GRAHAME, so nervous and pale,
With his hat on his head, and his mouth to his nail :
And their measures were done for, their plans overthrown,
And PEEL had to leave his own trumpet unblown.
And Conservative gentry are loud in their wail,
That the country is ruined if PEEL should turn tail;
And repeal of the Corn-laws, we soon shall record,
Has been won, not by PEEL, but a certain small lord.
A Real Blessing to Landlords.
THE GENUINE ANT1-APPETItive CURRY Powder, strongly recommended
by the Duke of Norfolk, is the labourer's only true substitute for bread
and meat. It possesses, the singular property of deluding the empty
stomachinto a sense of fulness, and is calculated to relieve those distressing
symptoms of vacuity which result from living on seven shillings a week.
It may be warranted to supersede potatoes and bacon; containing in fact,
in itself, the essence of gammon; and one pinch dissolved in a tumbler
of hot water is equal to a pot of beer. Landed Proprietors not wishing to
reduce their rents, will find this preparation admirably calculated to
reconcile labourers with their present rate of wages by enabling them
almost entirely to dispense with food.--Sold in pots, at from one shilling.
Agricultural Societies supplied. -

have had him in all shapes—The Duke
before Salamanca; The Duke reegh-
* noitring before Vittoria; The Duke
º; after ditto; The Duke shaving befºre
Ciudad Rodrigo, &c, &c.;-from that
º noble portrait of Lawhence, where he
Z is represented holding the sword of
- England (it was in 1815, and he could
wield it then), down to the last Daguer-
reotype of the neat, white-haired, old gentleman, whom we have
all seen rolling upon his horse in the Park and Pall-Mall—a
wonder to all bystanders that he did not topple over.
At last they have got him in a sixpenny picture-newspaper at
Church, Church is a very good place for him—whether artists could
not be better employed there than in making pictures of that
venerable hooked nose, is neither here northere.
Butlet it be conceded that he is getting old, as has been the lot
of other military commanders before him; “Tears of dotage,” we
know, flowed “from MARLBoRough's eyes:” there can be no
manner of doubt that ALExANDER THE GREAT, or NApoleon, if
they had lived long enough, would have grown old too. The Duke's
horse, which he rode at Waterloo, grew old, and was turned out to
grass to pass a comfortable senility, and died, greatly honoured and
lamented, long ago. Why keep the master in harness for ever ?
Recommend him quiet and a sunshiny paddock at Strathfieldsaye.
It is nonsense to say that because he won the Great Waterloo
Stakes in 1815 he is able to run with other horses now—it is not fair
that others should slacken their pace out of regard to him. We want
to move on. Here is the old gentleman, because he couldn't go the
pace in the Anti-Corn-Law coach, has stopped the carriage, sent back
the horses on their haunches, upset the coachman, and set the whole
team in disorder.
It may be perceived that we are writing with the utmost gentle-
ness. Great and strong ourselves, we reverence the brave who lived
before us. We are not going to bully the old Duke, but we assert
that his time for going to grass has arrived. The Times says he is
the leader of the aristocracy. Let him go and lead the Dukes. He
is fit for that; but not any longer for governing us.
Suppose that statue of his which is turned with its horse's tail
to the Exchange, should be removed by his adorers in the City, and
placed, for greater honour, let us say in the middle arch of Temple
Bar. It might look very well there, and the noble image would be
sheltered from the rain; but the street would be incommoded, the
omnibuses would not like it; the people going to business would
curse that aquiline-nosed barrier which interposed between their
livelihood and them—the moral is obvious. Punch means that the
old Duke should no longer block up the great thoroughfare of
Civilisation—that he should be quietly and respectfully eliminated.
For the future, let us have him and admire him—in history.
FIR 12 IN SU R ANGE.
At an agricultural meeting which lately took place at Arundel, a MR.
OLLIVER, agentleman farmer, took occasion, in proposing a toast, to make
a political allusion. For this he was called to order by the chairman, the
Duke of Norfolk, who observed, in reference to the forbidden topic:—
“I am aware that a very little would create a blaze, and I am one of those who wish
not to create a blaze.”
No doubt the Duke of Norfolk is one of a very large body. The
landed aristocracy in general, unquestionably, “wish not to create a blaze.”
This wish is not Utopian. There is reason to suppose it might be very
easily gratified. If landholders were to lower their rents a little, and
insist that the labourer should receive decent wages, they would be tolera-
and the workhouse.
“blazes.”
Those, who wish “not to create a blaze,” instead of drinking the
labourer's health, should give him something to drink theirs. For that
K. curry-powder tea will not do. The labourer will not adopt the
on Folk might-cap. No doubt curry-powder is a nice thing, so is sauce
piquante, so are capers—in their several relations to rabbit, chops, and
oiled mutton—curried, bones, perhaps, might be an improvement on the
* dietary: Curry-powder is a sauce; but the labourer has already
the best sauce-hun He will be content with beef and bacon with.
out º e Duke of Norfolk is ious “not to create a blaze.”
That is âte; else the Thames would have been on fire in no time.
“Skilly” and seven shillings a week occasion
THE DURE OF NORFOLK'S COOKERY,
We understand that the present Duke of Norfolk inherits the skill
he has lately shown in cookery from one of his ancestors, whose name
has become identified with that delicious edible, the Norfolk dumpling.
The Howard family are believed to be closely related to the celebrated
Duke HuMPHREY, whose hospitality was exactly of the kind that the
Norfolk cookery seems specially adapted for. It is expected that the
Duke will shortly publish a culinary guide for the benefit of the poor.
The brochure called, “How to live on a hundred a year,” will be super-
seded by a pamphlet entitled, “How to live on a pinch of curry.” The
following will be the style of the valuable receipts contained in the Duke
of Norfolk's new cookery book:
A CAPITAL 80 up,
Take a saucepan, or, if you have not one, borrow one. Throw in about
a gallon of good water, and let it warm over a "fire till it boils. Now be
ready with your curry, which you may keep in a snuff-box if you like, and
take a pinch of it. Pop the pinch of curry into the hot water, and serve
out, before going to bed, to your hungry children.
FORTITUDE and RESIGNATION.
France and the oregon oyster.
The Courrier Français maintains that “the rights of the United
States as well as of England to the Oregon territory are illusory, and that
France has the right, and ought to protest against any taking posses:
sion thereof by either of those Powers.” There is on record a celebrated
legal decision relative to a litigated oyster: Louis Philippº is too good a
lawyer not to remember it; and lawyers are apt to be guided by prece-
bly sure “not to ereate a blaze.” “Blazes" are ereated by starvation,
dents. Who can doubt how he would dispose of the Oyster?

CURIOUS CASE OF TRANCE,
. It is seldom that we hear in the present day of a state of trance con-
tinuing for any considerable period. We, however, read,the other day of
an old lady having continued asleep for upwards of ten days, and no one
was able to account for the phenomenon. At length on the eleventh
morning, while the medical men were in consultation as to the cause of
the Patient's condition, a knock came to the door, and a small document
was delivered to the son of the old lady which completely explained the
mystery. The document turned out to be a newspaper bill, from which
it seemed that the old lady had been for three successive months in the
habit of reading the Morning Herald. The usual remedies were success.
fully applied, but the case shows the danger of an immoderate use of strong
Inarcotics, -
A CONSULTING COOK WANTED.
CookERY has now assumed the rank of a science, at least as beneficial
as that of medicine ; and there should be the same subdivision of labour
in the culinary as there is in the medical profession. Common cooks, like
apothecaries, may be competent to ordinary practice ; but a consulting
cook is required in its higher branches. -
There are numerous cases of entremets, for example, which are quite
beyond the province of the general practitioner. The countless forms of
the pâté also, and the interminable varieties of sauce, present complexities
which the highest culinary skill alone can grapple with. Even in the
treatment of plain beef and mutton, a necessity frequently arises for
“another opinion.” . A turbot very often requires “further advice.”
Family cooks may manage family dinners, but on extraordinary occasions,
such as a banquet, or even a déjeńner a la ſourchette, let a consulting cook
be called in. A consultation should always be held over a haunch of
venison. The consulting cook ought to be a man of education, particu-
larly as regards modern languages, in order that he may be conversant
with the state of foreign science.
Something beyond a mere acquaintance with UDE, KITCHINER, and
RUNDELL, is required of a cook who takes the higher grade in his pro-
fession. He should be also qualified by his attainments to mix in the best
society, in order that he may acquire that experience which can only be
derived from often dining out. Of course he ought to keep his carriage
and footmen; and it might be well if he carried a gold-headed spit. His
fee could not be less than a guinea, which, let the dyspeptic recollect,
might save several. What improvements would take place in the Waterloo
banquet, not to mention the archiepiscopal dinners at Lambeth, and the
LoRD MAYor's and other civic feasts, were they superintended by con-
sulting cooks. Their influence, moreover, would soon be felt among the
masses; the meals of the community being now mostly confided to old
women, the results of whose empiricism are lamentably apparent in the
general complaints of joints among families. And lastly, as food is often
preferable to medicine, the consulting cook to a great extent would super-
sede the consulting doctor.

Punch in Chancery I
BRADBURY AND Evans v. Johnson AND Owen.
MR. BET HELL said he had a special application to make on behalf
of a most distinguished personage who had amused his Honour in
youth and now amused him in maturer age; he applied to the Court
for the protection of Punch (a laugh) against the robberies that had
been committed upon him. The Court was aware that Punch had
said he would gibbet his offenders, and that, accordingly, some of
their plebeian countenances had been handed down to posterity in the
pages of Punch, like flies in amber. (Laughter.) Finding them, how-
ever, insensible to shame, it became necessary to protect the interests
of Punch by weapons better suited to such offenders. Every work of
merit gave rise to base imitation, and like all distinguished authors,
from Ho MER downwards, Punch had been pirated. But so long as
they confined themselves to base initations, Punch said, smiling, with
| Hoa Ace —
“O imitatores, servum pecus, ut mihi saepe
Bilem, saepe jocum vestri movére tumultus !”
(laughter), and dismissed them with contempt. Everybody could
distinguish the real gold from the base metal. But now was Punch
assailed with the most barefaced plundering. Word for word were
articles transferred from his pages without even the politeness of
acknowledgment. The Court was aware, that to the gallery of
| English characters Punch had added two that would be handed down
to posterity as long as wedded life should subsist. He alluded to the
renowned MR. and MRs. CAUDLE. (Laughter). Now, the most enter-
taining, instructive, and profitable lectures of MRs. CAUDLE had been
clipped by the shears of those persons who made melodramas for the
stage, and they had also adorned, with due acknowledgment, the pages
of almost every publication of the day. Some publishers, however,
had lately become so hardened as to transfer to their columns Mas.
CAUDLE’s Lectures just as they were published, without the courtesy
of any acknowledgment whatever. Of these was a newspaper called
the Hereford Times, whose publisher on the 19th of July had copied
verbatim the eighth lecture of MRs. CAUDLE, which his Honour well
recollected (a laugh), the subject being the recent admission of
MR. CAUDLE to the Masonic body, when MRs. CAUDLE was indignant
and curious. The ninth lecture, which was delivered on the occasion
of MR. CAUDLE's visit to Greenwich Fair, was also transferred in the
same manner into that newspaper; so that the people of Hereford
were led to believe that the plebeian editor was the author of the
inimitable composition. It had not rested here; for, as we all loved
to see some sort of resemblance of the personages by whom we had
been charmed, the features of MR. and MRs. CAUDLE had been
handed down to posterity by Punch himself, in portraits which were
designed to convey to those who were sufficiently imaginative the
lineaments of those celebrated characters. There, Sir, (said the
learned counsel, handing a copy of the well-known portraits to his
Honour amid universal laughter) are M.R. and MRs. CAUDLE precisely
in the situation in which these admirable lectures were delivered.
Your Honour will mark well the features of MRs. CAUDLE, and read
every lecture in the wrinkles of her countenance, and the caustic
expression of the nose. (Laughter.) And there, Sir, is the base
imitation, as unlike the original as brass to gold. (The copy was
handed up for his Honour's inspection.) The Court was aware that the
world was indebted to the recollection of MR. CAUDLE for the lectures
which had been delivered by his dear departed wife; but were MRs.
CAUDLE herself still alive, and saw that base caricature of her counte-
nance, the Court might imagine the matrimon'al agonies MR. CAUDLE
would draw upon himself if he did not inflict summary vengeance on
those miscreants who had thus disfigured her. (A laugh.) It was upon
these grounds the present injunctions were moved for, to restrain the
publication of the Lectures, and to prevent these base imitations being
given to the world any longer. His IIonour knew that the fame of
MR. and Mrs. CAUDLE was universal. In every kind of shop these
imitations were to be seen. When you retired to a watering-place, you
found them adorning the letter-paper sent to you from the library;
and if a shopkeeper hoped for any success in his trade he left his card
with MR. and MRs. CAUDLE. Punch had, however, resolved these rob-
beries should continue no longer. The affidavits set forth that Messrs.
BRADBURY and Evans were the publishers of what they modestly
denominated a humorous publication, although without doubt his
honour would be disposed to assign a far more honourable title to Punch.
The first persons against whom an injunction was asked were Messrs.
Owen and another ; the next, selected by way of a scarecrow to
frighten away the rest, was the publisher of the Southport Visitor.
The Vice-CHANCEL Lon said, the piracies were so manifest that the
injunctions were a matter of course. He thought, however, they could
not be granted to extend to future offences, as the motion was framed.
Mr. BETHELL said, the orders would only be asked to protect the
, past publications of Punch.
In this form the in innctions were arrardinals, sex. 24
