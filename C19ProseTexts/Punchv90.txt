Junh 26, 1886.] PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A COLLOQUY AT "THE COLINDERIES."
Mrs. Britannia. Ah! this leafy nook is particularly snug, this tea is singularly refreshing, and the sound of Godfrey's
strains alternately soothing and stirring.
Mr. Punch. "Rule, Britannia," played perfectly, in a sort of scientifically-illuminated Fairy Land, amidst surround-
ings so stimulating to your imperio-maternal pride and affection, can hardly fail, my dear and much-honoured Madam, to
strike gratefully on those ears—extremely pretty ones—wearied as they must be with prolonged Party shindying.
Mrs. Britannia (sipping and sighing). Ah-h-h! Party Spirit, my dear Mr. Punch, is precisely the antithesis of this
vastly pleasant Pekoe; it is not piquant, and it does upset the nerves.
Mr. Punch. Well, Madam, after all, the nerves of your numerous progeny are remarkably strong ones, and soon steady
themselves into patriotic firmness, even after the wildest indulgence in the political absinthe-toping of Party-warfare.
Mrs. Britannia. Why, yes, thank goodness, and their stout Saxon stock! This is a sight to gladden my matronly
heart, is it not, Mr. Punch?
Mr. Punch. Imperial philoprogenitiveness could hardly desire a fuller satisfaction. What a year of home-coming
reunion and far-gathered family muster! Queen Victoria's Jubilee Year, which I have already celebrated in my Almanack
Cartoon. How eagerly everyone, from the ever-genial Prince to the usually stolid Civic Policeman, welcomes the home-
comers! The City Fathers, in all the ways open to them, at Cathedral Service, Memorial-Stone Ceremonial, Banquet, Ball,
Conversazione, and Fete, are doing their agreeable duty to "Our Boys." Pleasant to see the old Corporation and the
young Colindians hobnobbing at Tower Bridge, Guildhall, Mansion House, and Crystal Palace! It is indeed a case of
"Hands All Round," which must be deeply gratifying to patriots in general and the Poet-Laureate in particular.
Mrs. Britannia. Yes. There are those who say I am getting old and passee, Mr. Punch, and perhaps, appearing—as
at present—without my classical Amazonian arms, with a bonnet instead of the time-honoured halm, and the umbrella of
private life in place of a trident (which in haunts of peace and Pekoe like this might attract needless attention, although
mightily useful for toasting a muffin or crumpet), perhaps, in such matronly mufti I may look a little less Minerva-like, and
more buxomly redundant than in those more heroic moments selected by the designers of penny-pieces and of your patriotic
and classic Cartoons for my portraiture. Fact is I am bound to be in mufti here, or I should be lovingly mobbed. But 1
assure you that, surrounded thus by "my family," I feel as young as ever, and as war-proof as Boadicea or Britomart.
Mr. Punch. Of course you do, as your cantankerous critics will speedily find, if they put you to it. Years, my dear
Madam, years that bring the philosophic mind, and also the—ahem! rational uncorseted costume—incline the wise, and

weighty, to counsels of peace. But they who fancy we have pursily and pusillanimously outgrown, or abandoned, our arms,
will find themselves mightily mistaken, will they not, Tobias, my dog?
Toby {fortissimo). Wack-wow-wow-wow-wow! (AnglicS —" I believe you, my sempiternal Boy ! ")
Mrs. Britannia. Nice dog—and unmuzzled!
Mr. Punch. Because attached to his master, and entirely under control.
Mrs. Britannia. Let him have one of these pretty little jugs of cream, for my sake, Mr. Punch.
Mr. Punch. With pleasure. Lucky dog! How the lamps glitter, how the fountains flash! Hark !" Rome, sweet
I Home." Do you not feel the thrill that runs through the huge assembly, as you did when the divine Albani stirred the
hearts in us with the dear old ditty on that memorable Opening Day?
Mrs. Britannia. Yes. Even the Party Portent, Home Rule, has small terrors for me whilst my sons are ruled by this
passion for Home.
Mr. Punch. Excellently put, Madam.
Mrs. Britannia. But, do you know, Mr. Punch, I feel most seriously the weight of my immense responsibilities. Not
exactly in the mood of Matthew Arnold's much-quoted " Wearied Titan," who, if wearied of anything, must be wearied
of being eternally trotted out by profoundly philosophising patriots, like my dear old Spectator. (That journal, by the way,
I must really a^k Mr. Gladstone to look into again, as he is reported to have said that it is a paper he never reads. It isn't
quite fair to cut his old, old worshipper now that it has turned candid friend.) But to train and teach such a family in liberty
and in law, in self-dependence, and in fraternal friendship, is a tremendous task.
Mr. Punch. It is, my dear Madam. Do you suppose for a moment that your lojal and devoted Punch has for-
gotten it? He is a Titan who is never weary. Let me refill your cup. More cream? The modesty of Genius is—Truth;
and I tell it when I say that I have made arrangements to furnish you with an a'l-embracing and unerring Guide, Coun-
sellor, and Friend, which will lighten your burden as it will enlighten your " Boys."
Mrs. Britannia. How very nice and thoughtful of you, dear Mr. Punch.
Mr. Punch. I am always thoughtful, and never other than nice—to the nice. To others I cm, on occasion, be par-
ticularly " nasty." Ha! the strains of " God Save the Queen " die away, the exit bell booms through the big treasure-stored
Imperial Emporium. We must part, but my alter ego, my spiritual quintessence I will leave with you, an abiding and ever-
helpful presence. Therein you will find the Imperial Oracle, the Patriot's Principia, the Party Purge. The " vast orb of
your fate " will not loom—as mellifluous Matthew seems to fear—too vast, viewed in its fog-dispersing, darkness-dispelling
ii radiance. Take, dear Madam, as my best boon and blessing for " Britannia and her Boys," the bright Beacon-Star of our
collective "Colinderies" here, and the wide world round, your faithful and unfailing Punch's

attendance at this, one of the most important auctions that ever took
place, even in this spot. I needn't dilate on the circumstances that
have brought us together, and put the immensely valuable property,
which I am instructed to bring before your notice, into the market. Nor
need I mention, as you are all aware of it, that if twenty, or even ten
years ago, anybody had said that a scene like this could have occurred,
he would have been called a downright liar, Gen'lemen, if you'll
excuse a strong expression. But here you are, Gen'lemen, and here I
am! And what I am this day instructed to offer, without any
reserve, by my clients, the Irish People, is all that magnificent estate,
described in the catalogue, and situated in the region of their left
breasts. I mean their hearts, Gen'lemen. Yes, what I put up for
sale to-day, is the gratitude and contentment of the Irish Nation.

A Voice (apparently proceeding from a Gentleman who afterwards
gave his name as L-rd H-rt-ngt-n). Am I to understand, Mr.
Auctioneer, that the whole of this property is for sale, and that all
the tenants concur in the desire to sell?
Auctioneer. Ah, the Gen'leman over there no doubt refers to the
Ulster portion of the estate. (Feelingly.) Gen'lemen, I will not
conceal from you the fact that there has been a slight hesitation, I
will say more, on the part of the possessors of that part of the pro-
perty to see the whole put up to auction. But
The Voice. Twopence halfpenny!
Auctioneer (astonished). Twopence-halfpenny! Gen'lemen, I ap-

Auctioneer. I am instructed by my clients that if they ore left alone
with the Ulster tenants, they will very soon bring them to reason.

matter as this? Twopence-halfpenny, I regret to say, is the only
bid, so far.

A torrent that no conscience fetters,
No taste restrains; all great ones know

And crush the life from out a body?
Because Sir Rowland Hill was wise,
And Henry Fawcett 'cute and clever,
Must questions crass that urge replies,
Rob one of rest and peace for ever?
Alas! it little boots to ask!
To argue with the fool or fribble,
Is just a useless endless task.
Donkeys will bray, and dolts will scribble.

Will lade our postmen, pile our tables.

ROBERTS ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE
NEW YEAR.
I am a setting quite quiet and cumferal in my nice little room, all
alone by myself. The boys is all away, and my better arf is gone
out a shopping for a hole sixpennorth of New dear's Cards all the
way to Hislinton, coz there they 're ony fippence. So as Fry day will
be New Year's Day, alius a day for carm refleckshun, I shall at
wunoe proseed to lay out my derangements, I thinks they calls 'em,
for the New Year. I begins, naterally as I thinks, with the feenan-
shal department. With £12 lis. in the ouse, and a few trifles owed
me by waryous guwerners, I starts clear with about £20. How many
can say as mutch? And I am at peace with hall the wurld. Even
that little matter with Brown is all settled. He suttenly did call
me a week-need Waiter before my feller men; and as an Ed waiter
is amost alius on the stares, up or down, it was of coarse a werry
sewere blow to my defishency, and I felt it according; but wen he
hexplained as he did. not mean it fizzically, but only morally and
hinterlekshally, of course I was sattisfide, and we shook both our
ands artily.
Well, or'course, we begins our New Year, the nite afore, with our
customary Swarry, for which I stands in a rotation for Cheerman, and
altho our Maynew may be called simpel, our appytites is good, and
our speaches short and. sharp. There will be jest one clowd a clowd-
ing of our manly brows, and that's the distant roomer that again
comes home to us in a woice of thunder, namely that the Turtel
Fanners of Florrvdear have enounced the meloncholy fact that the
supply of their sillybrated crop is rappidly deminishing! Wot first
strikes the Ed waiter is the startling statement that Farmers grows
Turtel. In my total ignerance of natteral histery I thort as
Turtels was fishes, and was cort with strings and hooks like all other
fishes; but we all lives and lerns, waiters and all. The next pint is,
why carn't the farmers grow more? And the final won is, what on
ertn is to become of the Liwery Compennys and the grand old Cop-
perashun? And larstly, but not leestly, wot's to become of Hus!
But a trewce to these sollem thorts, tho' they will force their wild
way in wot shoud be this appy season.
We shall have no less than five young Waiters to inishiate into the
missterrys of our craft, but these are of course both private and con-
fidenshal. But I may say as I have seed a yung feller turn quite
pail with emoshun shortly after he had drunk his werry larst pledge.
The hurly munse of the year I shall deddicate, as usual, to my
Citty frends. They are a nice steddy set; and weather Mr. Par-
nell is made King of Ireland, as sum thinks likely, and his 80
yung men sent to Dubling to sit in a Parlyment of their own, whioh
none of us woodn't regret, or weather they all has their desserts, as
is ony rite and propper, the currants of their nobel lives wood
flow as usual, and they would require our priceless services as
usual. About the beginning of May I shall Have jest a week or
two at Grinnidge, as that's the rite time for White Bate, a delly-
cassy to witch I am partickler parshal, wen in season. The kind of
stuff we has to and round about this time under that honored name
is enuff to make the holdest waiter blush. But I quite intends to
dewote the principle part of my summer to the Injian Exhibishun.
1 'm told by them as nose the principle swells as is comming to it,
that they are that rich that they never has nothink but gold about
'em, and never takes no change! Wat a idear! It fulfils the

THE LATEST FAUST; OR, WILLS'S SMOKING
MIXTURE.
I saw the first representation of the Lyceum Fatut, and consider-
ing'that it teas the first night of Faust, it was Faust-rate. But many
things hare happened since then, and I believe that several effects,
not shown to the au-
dience then, are on
view now. Time
works wonders, and
so Time was called
in to work these which
would not move on
that eventful even-
ing'. For my part,
and for the actors
parts,I consideralirst
representation of any
play as only a su-
premely good rehear-
sal in the presence of
critics who are to sug-
gest improvements.
Several things that
ought to have been
done, as I am in-
formed, were left
undone on the first
night; and from my
own observation, I
can affirm that
about a quarter of
what we saw and
heard could very well
have been dispensed
with. The scene, for
instance, between
Mephistopheles and
the Student should
have been left out
altogether, as it is of
no value whatever,
and simply delays the
action without de-
veloping character.
The "marriage mo-
tive''—a concession to respectability on the part of "weak Wills"
—is a mistake; so is Marguerite's keen eye to wedlock. The rage
of Mephistopheles is quite out of character, but it gives Mr. Irving
what is termed " an actor's chance," and, as it was delivered with
subtle discrimination and genuine dramatic effect, this is not on the
list of things we could do without. Much that Mr. Wills evidently
considers humorous could be omitted with advantage, and this would
relieve the play of the boors in the Swizzle-house-and-Cathedral
scene, and we should " come to Hecuba" — that is. Marguerite—
much sooner than we did on the first night. The climbing Ghost,
bearing a curious resemblance to Mr. Gladstone, who has been going
up, up, up, for three hundred years, and who can t'' get rest at home,
or peace abroad," should be left speechless, as he comes up breath-
less. The awful Brocken scene, so-called from the fireworks—the
scene being a regular " Brock un,"—might be shortened by the omis-
sion of a demoniac laugh or two, which have, what Mr. Mantalini
would have described as " a dem'd private-madhouse sort of manner
about them." The sounds in the Parrot House at the Zoo are harmo-
nious in comparison with this Chorus of Witohes. But short or long,
it is a wonderful scenic effect. Mr. Irving, in his make-up, has imi-
tated the Mephistopheles of Ary Scheffer,—a great temptation to
write Arry Scheffer,—but I state this " on information received"
as I only imperfectly recall the picture ; but in imbuing this pictorial
conception with stage-life, Mr. Irving must have foreseen that
an audience would at once exclaim on his first appearance in Faust's
study, 1' Why, hallo! What's Dante doing here?"
Mr. Conway as old Faust was not old enough; but that was full
ten days ago, and he is probably older and wiser since then,—but
his'young Faust wasn't by any means young enough, as he looked
quite thirty-five; though, on second thoughts, this may have been
due to the artfulness of Mephisto, who did his victim out of thirteen
years of the compact.
I felt one great regret throughout—that it was not the Opera.
It seemed to lack something, and that something, it gradually grew
upon me, was the music and the singing. I remember the play years
ago, when Charles Kean was Mephistopheles, David Fisher Faust,
Carlotta Leclercq Marguerite (with an ascension d la St. Catherine
to finish), Mrs. Win Stanley as buxom and comely Dame Martha.
Cathcart Valentine, and Sixer the comic Siebel. It was a capital
Mephistopheles t Movement taken and-Dante; or,
giving to Ary Scheffer a Local Habitation and a
Name.
acting play and much^impressed my youthful imagination. Then,
years after, came Gounod's Opera, and it seems to me—though before
the experiment I should have protested strongly against any such
objection—that however excellent a drama on this subject might be,
it must disappoint all who are familiar with the Opera. Marguerite
and Faust are no longer Goethe's lovers, but Gounod's soprano
and tenor. - What are the jewels without that still greater jewel, the
song! What the parting to meet again without the great duett?
What is the return of the soldiers without the March? And
Mephistopheles with the mandoline, but without the serenade, is a
cruel mockery.
The sort of Jacob's ladder of angels, at the end, reminded me of
the tableau in Queen Katherine's dream, and is not, I fancy, so
effective as the St. Catherine picture of the old Princess's version.
But it was late, and I did not obtain more than a glimpse of it
as I hurried out to get "first keb." These are only my impres-
sions on the first representation of a piece which all London and the
Country wiU throng to see for the next six or eight months. Even
on the first night I thought Miss Terry, despite all nervousness, a
charming Marguerite, and Mr. Irving's Mephistopheles a most
striking and artistic performance. I should be inclined to say that,
taking his reading of the part for granted, it was as nearlv faultless
as possible. A play, illustrated with so much fire, and such brilliant
flashes of electricity, can never be dull; besides, should it even
exhibit any tendency to become slow, Mephistopheles at once gives
a cue and gets the steam up, and at another time he makes some
caustic remark which at once dispels the vapours. What with
the steam and the fireworks, and the vaporous mists, this new
version might well be called " Wills's Smoking Mixture." It sounds
a difficult thing to achieve, but it is no less the fact, that the steam
was overdone. It came up so frequently as to suggest the notion of
the District Railway being underneath with rather imperfect blow-
holes. Some of this steam has been blown off by now, no doubt, and
Mr. Irving has probably found it necessary also to curb the poetic
ardour of Mr. Wills, and to make a considerable reduction on
taking a quantity of Wills's Mixture, which, though not dramati-
cally strong, is a carefully prepared version of Goethe's poem. If,
as Mr. Irving, in his after-play speech, expressed a hope it would, the
present production induces the Public to read the original German,
then Corney Grain and the talented company of the National Hall
(St. George's) ought to give the Manager of the Lyceum a testimonial
for such an excellent advertisement, as all play-goers wiU become
regular German-Reeders. I shall see it again, when more from
Yours, Nibbs.
ALL THE WORLD AKIN.
I picked up the Nineteenth Century, one chilly autumn day,
In the quest of something light, wherewith to while the time away,
And I chanced upon an essay (as I turned its pages o'er)
Setting forth some thrilling facts, with which I'd never met before.
For it proved—quite irrespective of the Christian point of view—
That Mankind is one great family; that Pagan, Moslem, Jew,
Whether white, or black as jet, or copper-coloured be their skin,
Are, without the least exception, one another's kith and kin.
That the negro is my brother, is an axiom which, in youth,
Was impressed upon my intellect as pure and solid truth;
But I never quite believed it, for I somehow failed to see
What connection could exist between a blackamoor and me.
Still I'm willing to accept him as a cousin, out of hand—
All the more so as he dwells in an extremely distant land;
And I don't the least object to a Red Indian, or Malay
As a relative, providing he keeps far enough away.
'Tis a fact of which the author, Mr. Kendall, is cock-sure,
That all Englishmen now living, high or low-born, rich or poor,
Are descended from the people who inhabited this land.
When King Harold, hard by Hastings, made his last heroic stand;
That is, each and all of us, from each and ev'ry one who then
Drew his breath, and had his being 'mongst the English sons of men.
So that all we Anglo-Saxons of to-day, it would appear,
Are own cousins to each other, from the peasant to the peer.
Were it possible a monarch or a beggar to revive,
Who, eight centuries ago, in Merry England was alive,
One of Nature's holiest impulses should prompt us to embrace,
In that venerable personage, the Father of our race.
And again, if any one of us with Death could make a pact

I may mention, just at hazard, half-a-dozen of their names—
Abdcx-Hamid, Francis-Joseph, Kalakaua, David James j
Not forgetting, too, that literary potentate, the Shah,
Or the sanguinary Sovereign of Borioboola-Gha.
I 'm connected with Her Majesty by consanguineous links
Which unite us in relationship much nearer than she thinks;
For we both descend from Alfred in direct unbroken line,
And her lineage, down to Rufus, is identical with mine.
Now I know that she's my cousin, it annoys me to reflect
That I've given her some reason to complain of my neglect;
So I '11 write to her to-morrow just to say, as we 're akin,
That I '11 call on her whenever it may suit her to be in.
But, of all the startling facts that Mr. Kendall brings to light,
There is one that thrills my bosom with ineffable delight,
For it proves that all the inmates of the habitable earth
Were engaged, a thousand years ago, encompassing my birth.
And I think it is a thing of which a fellow may be proud,
When he finds himself by Science unexpectedly endowed.
With four thousand million ancestors—which (Mr. Kendall says)
Was the number of my forefathers in good King Alfred's days.
By the time that Norman William had been laid beneath the sod,
My progenitors had dwindled down to sixteen million odd.
It surprised mo, I admit, when first I learnt that, at that date,
The Bum-total of Old England's population was so great;
But the author states it as a fact of which he has no doubt,
And a reverend essayist ought to know what he's about;
Though it seems a little odd that the historians and he
With respect to their statistics should so widely disagree.
From our parity of origin the dogma is inferred
That all titles of nobility are futile and absurd.
And that equal in their right to ev'ry foot of British soil
Are the heir to countless acres and the lowly son of toil.
Furthermore, each free-born Englishman—the essayist maintains—
Is as legally a monarch as the Sovereign who reigns;
And our ladies, bless their hearts! will learn with satisfactionkeen
That there is not one among 'em who is not by birth a Queen.
For my kingship, I confess, I don't particularly care;
But, if land be common property, I mean to have my share,—
Something lucrative—it matters not how limited its space—
Say one-half of Regent Circus, or a block in Grosvenor Place.'
To obtain what's justly due to me shall be my future task.
I intend henceforth my " relatives" incessantly to ask,
"In this new redistribution scheme, pray where do I come in.

PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
MY CAREER AS A DEPUTY ASSISTANT REVISING BARRISTER.
With praiseworthy caution, Mr. Justice Dendlektns (who it
will be remembered gave me tne appointment I have had the honour
to hold amidst, I think I may venture to say, the heartfelt applause
of the English-speaking race—I have received letters of congratu-
lations, many of them—nay, to be quite accurate—most of them, with
the postage unpaid, from all parts of the Empire, literally by
hundreds); with praiseworthy caution, I repeat, his Lordship decided
that the Reviser should have an Assistant, and that I, when necessary,
should act as that Assistant's Deputy. Thus, there were three of us
always available to adjudicate upon those claims which the newly
enfranchised patriots (with the assistance of an electioneering agent)
were so anxious to establish. As England rang with the news of
what I then considered to be the brilliant finale to a long, and not
altogether unsuccessful, forensic career, it is scarcely necessary to
mention that the names of my Reviser and his Assistant were respec-
tively, Seyton Booms and Douglas Cracker, although it may be as
well to point out, for the instruction of laymen, that it was my duty
to be always at hand to represent Cracker, as in like manner it was
the duty of Cracker to t>e continually at the Reviser's elbow, to
represent him in cases of emergency. Unhappily there was a backslider
among us. Douglas Cracker (with whom I was naturally more
closely associated than the Reviser) in spite of my remonstrances,
flatly refused to follow his chief about, so as to be ready at a moment's
notice to take up his duties, preferring to spend his time in frivolous
visits to various well-known pleasure-resorts of a more or less agree-
able oharacter. This was most embarrassing to me personally, as of
course, as Cracker's Deputy, I was forced to be continually with him,
and had to follow him from Torquay to Scarborough, Boulogne to
Eastbourne, and Monte Carlo to a place hitherto unknown to me,
called Fogborough-on-the-Snooze. It was here that he suggested we
should part company.
"You see," he .argued, "all this constant travelling (and I have
such a volatile temperament that I really cannot keep three days to-
gether in one place, except perhaps here where I might remain for
months examining the myriad monuments in the Cemetery) must be
very injurious to your wife and the children."
Well," I replied, "we certainly did intend to spend the boys'
holidays quietly at Southend, and the fares to Monaco and back were
perhaps a little beyond our means, and unquestionably more than
we should have had to pay from Fenchurcn Street to the Essex
watering-place; but my dear fellow, I have not the slightest wish to
control your movements, and should feel much annoyed if any conduct
of mine induced you to consider me an incubus."
"Oh, not at all," he replied, but not very heartily.
After further discussion it was arranged that my wife and family
should proceed to Southend, to spend the remainder of the holidays,
while I accompanied Douglas Cracker to Margate, where, it ap-
peared, his Doctor had ordered him to undergo a mild course of
idleness and relaxation.
We took up our quarters in the Thanet Sanatorium at a boarding-
house of my official double's selection. The company assembling
daily at the tabk-cPhote were numerous, and fairly select. Rather
to my annoyance, Cracker attached himself to a very commanding
widow of forbidding appearance, whose sentiments on Woman's
Rights and kindred subjects were entirely antagonistic to my own.
He accompanied her everywhere—now on a long walk to Ramsgate,
now to a pic-nic at the Reculvers, yet again following that well-
known delight of seafaring Nimrods, the Thanet Harriers. I must
confess that the annoyance of having to accompany the Assistant
Revising Barrister in the character of his Deputy was much miti-
gated by the fact that the strong-minded widow had a rather well-
favoured daughter, of agreeable manners, whose escort naturally
became my care on our partis carri. At the Reculvers, as we missed
Cracker and her Mamma, Miss Rebecca Sarah and myself spent
the greater part of the day together, an occurrence which was
repeated subsequently in our burst after the Harriers, both the young
lady and myself being rather slow after hounds (especially in a rook
and sea-weed county), and, consequently, being unable to keep up
with the first flight, in which Cracker and the widow (whose hired
hack had bolted) prominently flgured.
It was two days after our hunt over the sands, that Cracker,
with an unusually grave face, told me that he wished to speak
to me.
"My dear fellow," he said, after a little humming and hawing,
"it is well to be frank with you, and to refer to a subject which
must be in both our thoughts. How could you have been so impru-
dent? And you a married man!"
I blushed up to the roots of my hair, and then turned white. If
there is one thing upon which I pride myself, it is my loyalty to my
hearth and home—a loyalty that I feel, were it to waver, would oanse
most unpleasant consequences, as my wife happens to be of an
extremely jealous temperament.
"What do you mean?" I faltered.
"Nonsense!" exclaimed Cracker. "You know all about it.
What could have induced you to propose to Miss Rebecca Sarah?
Why, it must end in either Breach of Promise or Bigamy!"
"Propose!" I repeated, perfectly aghast with surprise and horror.
I sat down and nearly fainted. Need. I say that I thought of my
dear innocent, but unduly suspicious and incredulous wife. Seeing
my extreme agitation. Cracker did his best to console me. It
appeared that Miss Rebecca Sarah had entirely mistaken the
character of my civilities, and informed her mother that I was
desirous of entering with her into the marriage state. How I cursed
my lack of foresight, in not telling the love-lorn maiden, during our
initial wandering by the sad sea wavelets, that I already belonged to
another! But at the moment such a piece of information seemed,
somehow, strangely out of place, and it never occurred to me, sub-
sequently, to mend, my personal description.
fl What shall I do? What shall I do?" I cried, burying my face
in my hands. "There is nothing in her charge, but the mere
raising of it will bring upon me untold misery!"
"Well, I think I can help you," said Cracker, after a pause.
"Of course, what I am going to say to you, is in strict oonfidence;
but the fact is, the widow is making-up desperately to me, and is pre-
pared to follow me anywhere. Well, suppose I go to Folkestone, she
will come there too—bringing with her her daughter. Then you can
quietly return to Southend and remain there till the storm has blown
over. Do you follow me?"
And the plan (not without arousing some suspicion on the part of
my wife) was carried out. But, being a conscientious man, I felt
it my duty, as I was unable to accompany, Cracker everywhere,
to resign my Deputy Assistant Revisership. I have consequently
resigned.
Aid now the anonymous and reptile-like correspondent who
recently sent me an envelope (unstamped) containing about a pound
of coal-powder, with the question (written on a dirty piece of paper],
"Why my name did not appear during the General Election," is
answered! A. Briefless, Junior.

Dowered with daring, and glowing with hope.

Light-hearted younker; but dangers down there
Yet may crop up, to the shock and surprise of him,
Poised for nis night with so jaunty an air.
Fair seems the start, and the fates smile auspiciously,
Ever when youth is agog for the race.
Does not the crisp winter-breeze blow deliciously,
Bringing health's flush into boyhood's brave face?
Out on the sun-season's languorous lassitude!
Summer delights may be grateful, perchance,
When crabbed age comes with dullness and crassitude;
Winter's brisk flouts set youth's pulses a-dance.
Softly, my lad! The keen joys of tobogganing
Sometimes are varied by cahots, or bumps.
Youth, in despite of its valorous sloganing,
Thumping of pig-skin and blaring of trumps,
Spite of its proudly precipitate perkiness,
Finds its fair course, and its flashing career,
Broken by jolting, and hindered by jcrkiness.
Just ask your starter, the fading Old Year.
He, too, is " off," in a different sense, you know,
He of the sport you are eager upon,
Hath an experience late and immense, you know,
Stoop to a " tip " ere the Old One is gone!
He will inform you he started as pleasantly,
Fully as sanguine, and equally smart;
Tell you that troubles and tumbles came presently,
Ere.he had got many yards from the start.
He will'assure you, that rapidly rocketing
Down the Toboggan-hill isn't quite all.
Buffets and bumps you will have to be pocketing.
Happy if dodging a spill and a sprawl.
He will acquaint you that steering is ticklish,
Down such a slide when the motion 's so swift:
Tell you that Toboggan Fortune—she's fickleish!—
Lands lots of wooers, waist deep, in a drift.
Well, well, my boy, Punch would not greet you croakingly
Let's make the start with gay humour and pluck;
Dangers, delights, facing jocundly, jokingly,
Never despondent or down on our luck.
Keep your eyes peeled, sit square down in your sled, my lad,

To be, with a view to this, more careful in the coming year to avoid

under any consideration, to be drawn, either into uttering any dis-
claimer, or making any avowal. Mem. again, To curb Herbert in
his improvident, and but partially considered expression of opinion
which, fathered on to me, entails on me either the silence of
acquiescence or the still greater inconvenience of public repudiation.
I must speak to him about this. Also, if I can see my way to it, I
must manage to have some serious talk with Hartington. He surely
must be contented to follow where I am disposed to lead. He sees
no reason, he says, '1 to depart, in any degree, from the declarations
which he has made, or the opinions he has expressed." This will
surely depend on circumstances. Mem. To impress this upon him,
and point out the possibility, under certain conceivable conditions, of
not only one, but all of us being compelled to depart in every degree
from the declarations which we may have made, and the opinions we
may have expressed. To fail to realise this, is to be deficient in the
bare understanding of elastic Statesmanship. It is to undervalue
the true meaning of the word majority, and for a mere whim, be
willing and prepared to forego its advantages, and sacrifice its emolu-
ments. Certainly, I must speak to Hartington. With regard to
Duke, I feel more constrained. I do not, I admit, understand his
attitude. It would almost savour of opposition. Yet it cannot be
that, for it would be too grotesque. Chamberlain, too, has shown
some curious signs. Mem. To investigate the causes of this, and
set it right. For to set it right must be an easy matter, seeing that
neither the one nor the other have any existence whatever outside of,
or apart from me. - I must teach them this. Taking a broad and com-
prehensive view of the situationj however, I note only one thing clearly,
and that is, that coute que coute, I must, somehow hold on, and—
get in.
From Hatfield.—Resolved to stay in at all hazards, this is the con-
clusion we have come to. How we shall manage it is another matter.
I am free to confess that a Dublin Parliament does not frighten me,
but the difficulty will be to give it them, in the face of our own
Irish Members, whom I fear nothing, not even the paramount im-
portance of our staving in, will square. What is to be done?
Churchill, who feels hotly about the ungracious indelicacy of their
attitude, will not be able to argue them out of it. No, with all his
eloquence he won't be able to manipulate or manoeuvre a single vote.
On the other hand, to abandon Parnell will be to challenge defeat.
Yet defeat must be avoided, at all hazards. It is very doubtful to
me what I ought to do. _ Only one duty is clearly marked out befor*
me, and that is, to stay in. Would any compromise with the Whigs
assist this end? A stern front to the Nationalists, and a vigorous
coercive programme, might gain us sufficient support in this direc-
tion. Anyhow, the idea is worth a venture. "A Dublin Parliament
and divided Empire " on the one hand, or, on the other, "Integrity
and Coercion "—either cry might suit our book. The question is,
which is it to be? The answer is, unfortunately, dubious. One asks
aghast, which promises to us the longest lease of the Treasury Bench.
Mem. Half a mind to toss up for it, the outlook is so uncertain.
Meantime, discretion counsels reticence. Resolved, therefore, to
wait upon events, and know only one settled purpose, and that is,
coute que coute—to hold on, and to stay in.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.
No. X.—From the Markiss.
Hatfield, Monday.

Dear Toby,
I write primarily to wish you
a Happy New Year, but take the oppor-
tunity to lay before you my position,
and to ask your advice upon it. It is,
rulv, one of great difficulty. If the
result of the General Election had been
such as to give Gl-dst-ne a small
majority, over us, and the Farnellites
—say, not to put too fine a point upon
it, five—it would have been well. We
would then have been masters of the
situat ion—that is, of course, if we could
have kept P-R-N-LL and his merry men
straight. It is true there were not ten
righteous men in Sodom, but in the
Gomorrah of the Liberal Party there
would surely have been found ten, or,
peradventure, a score of Moderate Libe-
rals who would, upon occasion, help
us to save the State—that is to say, to turn out Gl-dst-ne, and bring us in.
If the result had been to give us a substantial majority, it would have been
better. As it is, it is nothing but desolation and despair. Counting the Par-
nellites true to us, we are in the ridiculous position of being six of one, and half-
a-dozen of the other. Just half and half! Think of that, dear Toby, for a
man who has to carry on the Queen's Government. Six hundred and seventy
Members of the House of Commons, and every individual man carrying in the
palm of his hand the fate of the Government. J-s-ph G-ll-s poising himself
at the Bar with thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat,could upon a polled-
out division, say whether we should live or die. We shall be a sort of Mahomet's-
Coffin-Government, hung 'twixt heaven and earth, and not sure at what
moment, at the caprice of what individual, we may not be dashed to the ground.
These are reflections, Toby, which dim the radiancy of the New Year. It is
mockery to wish a Happy New Year to a Minister thus situated. The question
is, What am I to do? There are, I suppose, three courses open to me. Let us
see what they are. In the first place,T might resign, and let Gl-dst-ne come
in to deal with this tangled skein. You know me well enough to believe that
this is a course I am quite ready to take. I did not want to come in, and I am
quite ready to go out. I am happier in opposition than in office. I am not then
so hampered by stubborn facts, can use more Btrong language, and can with fuller
freedom and effect make Gr-nv-lle sit up. But there are other people to be
considered. There are. Priests who want Bishoprics, Lawyers who yearn after
Judgeships, Viscounts who hanker after Earldoms, Marquises who desire Duke-
doms, my colleagues who want to stop in office, and behind them all good Con-
servatives in the House of Commons, who are ready to fill up vacancies.
n-RC-RT has done an enormous damage by his declaration that we shall never
be in office again. Of course, it isn't true, but it has frightened fellows, and
the mere talk of resignation brings, what the late Mr. O'C-nh-ll might have
called, a beastly buzzing about my ears. It is clear that I must hold on as
long as finger-nails stand fast.
The second course, is to draw closer the alliance with P-rn-ll, bring in a
bold scheme of Home Rule, and dish the Liberals, as once the Whigs were dished.
That,. I confess, is what I would do, if I dare, and so would R-nd-lfh. But
dare I? Could I? I think not. First of all, P-rn-ll is not to be trusted. He
would take all I could, after infinite labour, induce our people to give him, and
that secured, would immediately ask for more; and I could not give him anything
like what would pacify him. D-sr-li might, but there was only one D-sr-ei,
and by his personal influence I cannot now profit. All the venomous Orangemen,
all the thick-headed Noodles of our Party (this is private
and confidential) who cannot see bevond the length of their
nose, would revolt, and we should be stabbed in the back.
The third course is, after all, the easiest and the safest.
I dare not resign; I cannot carry Home Rule; but to beg
I am not ashamed. I will beg the assistance of the
Moderate Liberals, and, together with the Noodles afore-
said, we will resist P-rn-ll and all his works. The
probabilities are that thereupon Gl-dst-ne will come to
the front, will run up the Home-Rule flag, and then we
will go to the country with the cry, "the Empire in.
danger!"
As I think of this, my spirits are uplifted. The very
act of writing to you, my friend and counsellor, has
cleared away the mists of depression that weighed upon,
me when I sat down. You will doubtless have seen the
announcement that I was about to publish an Essay on
"Multitubular Molecules." It shall be withdrawn. It
came about in this way. Immediately after the tide
turned in the Counties, I received a letter from J-M-s
Kn-wl-s asking me to write an Article for the " Nine-
tcetith Century." I knew what that meant. As soon as
ever Gl-dst-ne is tottering to a fall, K"n-wl-s writes to
him for Articles in his Magazine. I was disappointed,
and in low spirits, accepted, the omen, and began the
Essay. But, like the window in Aladdin's tower, it un-
finished shall remain. I will go in for the Moderate
Liberals, and my young men shall keep their offices, and
continue to draw their salaries. With more heart I

PUTTING IT OFF.
Tnp, continued delay of Aiimed MorxnTAR Pasha, the
Turkish Commissioner, to start for Egypt, has at length
produced a protest from Sir William White, to which
the following excuses have been promptly rejoined. The
Commissioner, who, however, has at last started, urged
that he has had to delay his departure—■
Because he had been waiting for his dress-coat to come
home from his tailor's.
Because he is such a bad sailor that he hadn't liked to
start till the wind changed.
Because he has been taking a few finishing lessons in
Egyptian, on the Ollendorff system, to enable him to un-
derstand the Khedive when he gets there.
Because he wanted to have just one more confidential
chat with Sir William White before he starts.
Because he had made all arrangements to leave next
Tuesday.
Because he really did not know how Mr. Gladstone
would take it.
Because he was not aware that there was any particular
hurry.
Because he thought Lord Salisbury might possibly
have something further to say to him.
Because the Treasury had not yet provided him with his
travelling expenses or even paid his fare.
Because he had been detained to take a hand at cribbage
with the Sultan.
And lastly, because if he had really thought Sir Wil-
liam White was in earnest about the matter, he would
have seen to its being practically set on foot, and have
gone on board before.

GRIST TO THE MILLAIS

No. 2. Tho Ruling, Passion; or, The Last
Dave of an Old Lowther Arcadian. "As a
child he had been remarkably fond of dolls;
as an old man the taste of his early days
returned to him."—Memoirs of Dr. Dol-
linger.

AT THE GROSVENOR.

No. 20. "Fife to Four—on the Field." Some critics
are of opinion that this at the time it appeared had
a secret sporting meaning. Notice the section of
drum in the corner: "not too muchydrum, but just
drum enough." All artists agree that such a drum
would be very hard to beat.

No. 6. The Hug-me-not drop me; or, The One-
legged Lover. It was this picture that first
gave the painter a leg up.
■46. Mr. Gladstone's Overture to Lord
Salisbury on the Irish Harp. Observe
the colour of the gown; by it the artist
meant to convey that the G. 0. M. was
either very ready, or deeply read. For
further information on the subject,
apply to Sir John Millaij), Bart.



No. 60. "Rum? What's she been putting in the bottle?"
Two figures. She is reading aloud some of Mr. Punch's
"Receipts for Nightcaps," and he is considerably exer-
cised by the peculiarly nasty flavour of his evening grog.
No. 65. Getting into Bed with his
Boots on. Closer inspection will show
what the painter really intended. It
will well repay a second visit; but seen
when the electric light was shining
"like winking," this was our first
momentary impression of the subject.
No. 94. "Afternoon Tay in Scotland."
The Highlander in the foreground is
asking the girl jestingly to clean his
boots; the Lowlander in the distance
has his eye on the afternoon Tay, which
in this part of the country is quite an
institution.
No. 88. "Pigeon Pie is very nice."
Two Dutch girls find themselves left
alone without anything to eat, except
this bird. They are consulting on tho
best means of cooking it.

TnE MrLLAls-Nim.—Labor omnia vincit may well be Sir John
Mjllais' motto, for if ever pictures were " laboured" it was these
early ones of his, painted in the Paint-pot-of-Basil period. The pic-
ture of the Highlander and the Seated Highlander, so far off as to be
a Lowlander, shows indifferently well in the collection. As for the
"Holy Family " it is a "Wholly British Workman Family," exqui-
sitely paintea, of course; but excepting one figure there is not an
Hebraic type among them. A picture in the corner representing two
ugly Dutch girls fondling a pigeon, which presumably they are going
to nave in a pie, suggests that the title might be 1 Parting is such

—except perhaps to a gentleman with a British-Museuniish'am'mus
towards pigeons; but as a work characteristic of the,"undecided'phase
in Millais Art-career, "it is full of interest, as indeed'is almost.cvery
picture in the Grosvenor Gallery. The old public favourites are as fresh
as ever, and the meeting between Sir John and his '' Huguenots" after
a separation of thirty years, was,'we are informed, a most touching
sight. The electric light, toned by a"]medium, is, after the first ten
minutes of jerkiness,—for it is a bad starter, not that anyone would
think this from its manner of starting,—very pleasant for the eyes:
but it is a pity it cannot be made to hold its noise." The show will
be one of the successes of the Winter Season.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
"HERE WE ARE AGAIN!"
{The Lane and The Avenue.)
Augustus Druriolanus has given us a first-rate pantomime. Its
highest praise is that it is calculated to enchant and amuse the
children. Aladdin, by E. L. Blanchard—of course it is E. L.
Blanchard's, and far off
be the day when his name
shall not be to the Drury
Lanebill—is toldin fifteen
scenes of Pleasure inten-
sified by two final touches
of Payne. Mr. Harry
Payne, as usual, is the
Clown, and makes his
first appearance in the
character of a new
Country Clown or Rural
Voter, already possessed
of a Cow, and only wait-
ing for the Three Acres.
Why should he wait?
At all events there's Long
Acre at hand to begin
with.
The Pantomime com-
mences well in the old
grim-guffin style, with
big heads and nothing in
them,—(Dburiolanus
should book this idea for
a Pantomime Parliament
in his next annual), and
that mellifluous warbler,
Mr. Herbert Campbell,
is discovered as a Wizard,
to whom arrive a couple
of Wizarders—which is
the puntomimic for " visitors," only you wouldn't think it, would
you t—accompanied by a valuable piece of old China in the shape
of a huge dog, the names of whose amusing fore and hind legs I do
not see mentioned in the Bill.
The change from this scene to the City of Pekin is change in full.
Here Miss Kate Leamab appears as the Princess, who is mistress
of herself tho' China fall,1' while, among the boys, Miss Grace
Huntley "takes the cake," or rather the " Huntley and Palmer's"

Brother Masons Past Masters Augustus and
Charles, building up the Aladdin Pantomime.

Princess Kate Leamar "going to Bath," but prevented by there being
A Lad in there already.
biscuit. She is evidently a Prince of Extravaganza in disguise, and
not a bit of the gamin de Pekin, whom Miss Nellie Farren immor-
talised when she sang that best of character songs, written by Mr.
Robert Reece, called " The Street Arab." Who that heard it will
ever forget—
"Please, Sir, 'old yer nag, Sir,
Take yer little bag, Sir,
Worry 'ard to live—
Just what you '11 give—
Thank ye, Surr."
Ah, that was a genuine touch of Human Nature !—if Messrs.
Harris and Pettitt will permit me to infringe their copyright title.
Now that Artistic Baronetcies are flying about, we ought to read in
the Times—it is better than seeing an Artist's name in the Gazette—
that the Queen has graciously conferred a Baronetcy on the dot/en of
scenic Artists, who will .henceforth" be'Sir .William Bevebly; and
Knighthood—say a Boxing-Knighthood—on the younger Painter,
say Sir Henry Emden, who is responsible for most of the scenes in
this Pantomime.
There are some four or five processions in Aladdin, the principal
one being that entitled " The Dream of Fair Women," tastefully de-
signed by Mr. Alfred .Thompson, which, culminating in the
assemblage of the Heroines of Fairy Story, are excellent. Madame
Katti Lanner's well-
trained Pupils are among
the chief features of the
Show. But where were
the modern Professional
Beauties? Where? Is
it possible that they have
vanished! Why it seems
only yesterday — no
matter, let us look at
Venus " of all time," and
at Helen of Troy, and
all the other lovely beings
who are "charmed "to
appear in response to the
summons of the Genius
of the Lamp.
By the way, Mrs.
Lanotry is coming out
again, at the Prince's, in
aMelodrama. of, I believe,
the deepest dye. One of
the chief characters in it
is an idiot. How very
difficult it must be to fill
this part.
Mr. Nicholls is quietly humorous in Widow Twankay: but the
best thing he does is a dance, in which he gives a burlesque imitation
of Kate Vaughan's style, of which—but that it comes rather late—
the audience would never tire. Mr. Herbert Campbell's song, " Old
Clo'," makes a decided hit, and is encored until there are no more
verses left.
Mr. CnARLES Lauri, as Kazrac, does a marvellous dance, and the
Prime Minister (Mr. H. M. Edmunds), with his acrobatic Secretaries
of State (the two Alberts), will make the children clap their hands
with delight. The very youngest among us take peculiar delight in
the misfortunes of others, and the Pantomime that has the most
whacking, knocking about, tumbling down, and serious accidents,
is surest of success with children. Then, again, little children in the
front of the house, love to see little children on the stage, and^they

"Sweetness and Light."

] Madame Katti Lanner and her little Christmas parties, "small and late."
will be delighted this year with the juvenile builders, the masons,
the carpenters, and the workmen engaged in raising Aladdin's palace.
To these workmen of Little Britain, come their wives, and children in
Serambulators. It is a capital scene. Sir William Beverly
iart.'s Transformation is in nis best'style. Mr. Oscar Barrett—
"Oscar," not" Wilson "—has introduced plenty of .familiar litunes
in which the Gods delight, as if it were the music of the spheres, and
altogether the Great Druriolani, Augustus et Carolus, may strike
a medal, without a reverse, in commemoration of their latest Panto-
mime. "Latest" is the word: it would still bear half-an-hour taken
out of it.
At the Avenue.—Kenilworth, by Messrs. Varney—no, Fabney—
and Reece. Miss Violet Cameron is rather thrown away in it on
very ordinary songs and burlesque dances, dance she never so grace-
fully. Mr. Arthur Roberts is, to quote an eminent authority,

praise is . due i to ;Miss
Laura Linden, who acts

part does not suit her.

be described as a Roberts'
Entertainment, entitled Keniltvorth." He is certainly very droll
and original, but the favourite first, and the rest^nowhere, is a plan
which has never yet made the fortune of any Burlesque, and never
will. At least so thinks Quill Nibbs.
P.S.—I^defer some remarks I have to make on a second hearing of
Faust, at the Lyceum, until your other young men have sent in their
theatrical notices. Any time within the year will do, as Faust is in
for a long life.
DACOITS AT HOME.
One of the greatest troubles in what is now British Burmah is
Daeoity, or gang-robbery. The British Administrator's watchword
will, of course, be "Down with Daeoity!" Good. But England
also is troubled with its Dacoits, in the persons of its plentiful and
Srosperous Rings of Middlemen. These money-snatching Monopo-
sts are genuine "gang-robbers," robbing producers and tradesmen
of their legitimate profits, home manufactures of their credit, and
the poor consumer of his chances of cheap commodities, in secret,
subtle, and sinister ways suspected by few. When will British
Commerce, which is slowly becoming aware of their baneful influence,
adopt as its watchword, Down with Trade Daeoity!" Co-opera-
tion among smaller Manufacturers to resist the extortions of the
Middlemen, which, individually, they are not strong enough to
r»se, might not be a bad beginning. But, in this country, it
ost seems as though Co-operation were impossible—except among
rogues and tyrants.

EXTRACTS FROM THE DIARY OF ONE OF THE 86.
Sure I little thought as they were in real earnest, when I was
asked if I should object to leave my little shop, for just about six
months, and go over to London as an honourable Munber of Par-
liament, and five like a fighting-cock, with all expenses paid! It
didn't take long for me to make up my mind, for what with the bad
times, and the subscriptions of all sorts to keep the agitation agoing,
the little shop's profits^hardly pays the little shop's rent, and the trifle
required to keep the Missus ana the two children in dacent comfort.
Since my election I've had no troubles of a pecuniary nature, for every-
thing is managed in a most truly liberal manner. ' I might, if I had
pleased, have most solemnly declared that my Election was about the
cheapest on record, for it cost me nothing, though it must have cost
somebody a goodisn bit, and, strange to say, somebody didn't like
it, and actually lost his temper over it, and even published the fact.
I have had several meetings with, some of my colleagues, who are
old stagers at our peouliar phase of Parliamentary life, and from them
I have received instructions as to the rules that are to guide my
conduct. My first duty is implicit obedience. Having been for years
shouting for Liberty, and subscribing for Liberty, and voting for
Liberty, this, at first, seemed somewhat startling, until I was in-
formed, on the very highest authority, that the entrance to the
Temple of Liberty is through the portals of abject submission.
The next duty of my colleagues used to be, I was told, to behave
on every possible occasion in so insulting, and irritating, and ob-
structive a manner as to make them the nuisance, and the hatred, and
finally the terror of the House of Commons, and I was informed, in
the most flattering terms conceivable, that it was my well-known
capacity for taking a leading part in such awfully jolly proceedings,
that had procured me the honour of representing my noble country.
But that now—thanks to the brilliant success that had attended these
high-minded attempts to make our natural enemies, the gentlemen of
England and Scotland, ready to make abnost any sacrifice to get rid
of us from among them—our duty would be, as the absolute masters
of the situation, to sit quietly and watch, while the leaders of the two
great Parties who alternately govern the British Empire, bid against
each other for the honour of our support!
While I listened with wonder to these astounding revelations from
the lips of men who had gained the high honour of absolute execra-
tion from the whole Saxon race, and which revelations we all washed
down with copious draughts of the purest potheen, my thoughts
would revert to my position only a month ago, a little month, as
somebody says—when the approach, of quarter-day brought anything
but joy to my anxious soul—compared to my present position, when
the highest and the noblest—and who used to be thought the proudest
and the most honourable—in the land were about to bid against each
other in the Great Council of the Nation, and in the face of an
astonished world, for the support of me, and such as me!
My companions very much surprised me, too, by telling me that
while they allowed their nominal Leader to arrange all financial
matters—an arrangement which they found very conducive to their
personal comfort—that of course it was quite understood among
themselves that it was owing to them, and not to him, that matters
had assumed their present favourable aspect. That if they had all
been of the same milk-and-water nature, and almost gentlemanly
manners as he, would the House ever have loathed the Party as it
did, and have offered any sacrifice to get rid of them, as they were
about to do, certainly not. Whoever neard the House groan when
he rose to speak? Whoever heard him accuse the Irish Secretary of
murder, or something so like it, that few could see the difference?
Whoever heard him beard the Speaker till the whole House cried
shame? No one. No, it was the men whose names were seldom
uttered without a curse, or other expression of disgust, that had made
the Party what it was; namely, the master of Ireland, and the hatred
and terror of England!
It is well known to every newsboy, they said, that the Irish
Party are masters of the situation; that one Leader is about to offer
us the same independence as that possessed by Hungary, which
would give Ireland Home Rule, ana alter Her Majesty's title to
Empress of Great Britain and India, and Queen of Ireland. That
the other Leader is about to outbid him by offering us a Parliament
in Dublin, with the charge of our own Police; but that it was well
understood among ourselves that neither would be accepted, and for
this very good and sufficient reason. We, the Irish Party, are quite
content with things as they are. We live comfortably on the fat of
the land; we have achieved notoriety, if not fame; and we know full
well that, if a satisfactory arrangement were come to, our peculiar
services would no longer be required, but, to use the language of Jour
enemies, we should have to give way to men of whom freland might
be proud rather than ashamed, and who would think rather of the
glory and prosperity of their poor down-trodden country than of
their own beggarly private interests. With a parting glass to the
parting toast of,'1 Suocess and Prosperity to the 861" we separated with
mutual expressions of profound respect.

TO-MORROW, YOU KNOW!"
TEMPTATION OF THE GOOD
ST. GLADSTONE.
(Imitated from a Celebrated Original.)
The good St. Gladstone sat on his stool,
A-reading a big black book,
With a steadfast patience, as was his rule,
For he never frivolled or played the fool,
Like a wanton urchin a-weary of school:
But, though 'twas the rollicking season of Yule,
He studied, in quiet, and kept himself cool,
On his stool of repentance—a hard-bottomed
stool—
And ne'er from that sage
Constitutional page
His reverent gaze he took.
"We will woo," cried Old Nick, "good
St. Gladstone's eyes
Off from that excellent book.
We will cluster around him in strange dis-
guise.
And plague him with shindies and Party cries,
And Dotner his bosom with phantasies,
That he upon us may look."
So they came to the Saint in a motley crew
A heterogeneous rout.
There were imps of every shape and hue.
And some looked yellow, and some looked blue,
And they passed and varied before his view,
And twisted themselves about.
But the good St. Gladstone kept his eyes
Fixed on that excellent book.
From it they did not sink or rise,
Nor sights, nor laughter, nor shouts, nor cries
Could win away his look.
One black imp came in a masquerade
Most like a ghoul's attire,
With a face like [a skull in dry parchment
arrayed,
And bat-wings ..dingy that fluttered and
played
About St. Gladstone through light and
through shade,
Till they made the Saint perspire.
And another one camelapparalled
In silk and velvet stun,
With a sort of tiara upon its head,
And a shadowy alb, and a ghostly cope,
And a scowl of anger, and tear, and hope
Upon a phiz that,seemed carven from soap;
And the row it raised.
As it blustered and blazed,
Was noisier than enough.
Another yet, of diminutive size,
And with hairy lip and with goggle eyes,
A winged weird creature, wee.
He pounced like a hawk, and he whisked like
the wind,
And he whooped and hawed, and winked and
And his eyes stood out with glee:
And the more the Saint he deafened and
dinned,
The more exulted he.
But the good St. Gladstone bent his eyes
Upon that excellent book.
He heard the shout and the laugh arise,
But he knew that the imps had a naughty
guise,
And he did not care to look.
And a thing with horns like a cow was there,
And a tall so strangely long
It might have surrounded three acres of
ground;
And it bellowed and lowed with a dubious
sound,
And whisked that wonderful tail around,
As'it roared out a sort of a song:
"OWGladdy, myjboy. shut up that book,
And don't look as Whiggish as Gbet!
Youjsit like an owl in his clerical nook,
You like an old-fashioned Economist look;
Come straighten'your back from its pedagogue
crook,
And more socially act, I pray!
The Socialist song let us hear you sing;
Take a lesson from me, Grand Old Man!
Remember that life has a fleeting wing,
That times are changed, that the Crowd is
king,
That Progress must smash up the Property
Don't heed the clerical ding-a-ding-ding,
Give the populace something with pepper and
sting.
Chuck up that old volume, go in for a fling
Of power and place while you can!"
But the good St. Gladstone bent his eyes
Still on that excellent book.
He heard that song with a laugh arise,
But he knew that the Imp had a ('
guise,
And he did not care to look.
And inky imps, in a comical rout,
Peered wickedly in, and whisked nimbly
about:
To badger the Saint and to draw him out
Was palpably their intent.

One sly-looking fellow in Truth was there,
A taking' of notes with a cynical air,
Like a demon reporter who no one would
spare;
And a hevy of quill-wielding bogies did glare,
And gibber, and cackle, and bark and blare,
And hint horrid suggestions, and questions
unfair,
Drop "bangs " by the bushel, and fibs every-
where,
In a style fit to drive a poor Saint to despair,
With time and much trouble f orespent.
Yet the good St. Gladstone sunk his eyes
Deep in that excellent book.
He twigged their game, and he so was wise
To guess that the gang had a ghastly guise,
And he did not dare to look.
Last comes an imp—how unlike the rest—
A beautiful female form!
With two dark Irish optics that ogle with zest,
With a blooming cheek and a buxom breast,
And a shamrock brooch in its snow doth nest,
And her lips are soft and warm.
As over his shoulder she bends the light
Of her dark eyes on the page,
She fires his heart with its ancient might,
With thoughts of old seasons of glorious fight,
'Neath the Shamrock Shield in ,thc cause of
right.
To aid hapless Beauty is still his delight,
Though he's grey with the frosts of age.
So gentle she seems, so appealing, so sure
Of his help, as of old; 'tis a parlous lure!
Pride, pity, and promise of fame !—
What lurketh behind it, that beautiful mask,
Will the good Saint see, will the good Saint
ask?
Will he know that the Devil is at his old
task?
Will he twig this last form of his game?
Ha! the good St. Gladstone boggles his
eyes
Over that excellent book.
Ho! ho! at the corners they seem to rise.
He feels that the thing hath a lovely guise,
And—will he decline to look?
There are many devils that walk this world—
Devils large and devils small;
Devils saint-meagre, and sinner-stout;
Devils with cow-horns, and devils without;
'Cute devils that go with their tails upcurled,
Bold devils that carry them bravely unfurled;
Meek devils, and devils that brawl;
Serious devils, and mocking devils;
Imps for churches, and atheist revels;
Devils cheeky, and devils polite;
Blue and buff, and black and white;
Devils that gossip, and devils that .write;
Devils that slaver, and devils that bite;
Devils that posture as angels of light;
Devils that rill green youth with spite;
Devils that dim Old Ag^e's sight;
Devils foolish, and devils wise;
But a blarneying Colleen with two bright eyes
Is the temptingest devil of all!

I can—whether you consider it advisable, in the interests of both
parties to this suit, in your own interest, and in mine, in the cause of
Justice, and the Public Convenience, to persevere in your request?
Counsel for the Defendant (struggling with his emotion). My Lord,
I may say that this is the most painful moment in my whole life! I
am compelled, by my sense of duty, to ask that an Extra Special
Jury may be sworn.

Judge (after a pause, filled up by looking at Mr. Nilly, more in
sorrow than in anger). Let it be so. (In a hollow voice.) The Extra

Witness Box—after a tussle, twelve good men and true are sworn in.)

he has made of your abilities. Now, Gentlemen, the matter is a very
simple one

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.
No. XL—From an Old Tactician.
Hawarden Castle, Monday.

Two nights later I attended an enthralling lecture on gym-
nastics, practically illustrated by young gentlemen, who
tumbled about in an extraordinary manner. But the
best of the fun came after, when everybody had departed,
and H-hb-bt and I had the place and apparatus to our-
selves. If you had seen me hanging on to the trapeze
by one leg, standing on the parallel bar shead downwards
supported by my arms, or holding straight out two
fifty-six-pound dumb-bells, you would never have for-
gotten" it. I find these little diversions do me good,
distract 2 my thoughts, and prepare me for the
Session.
Wishing you a Happy New Year, and many of
I remain, Yours faithfully,
W. E. Gl-dht-nk.
To TOBT, M.P., The Kennel, Barks.
DjvA-R Toby,
I obser v t, through the usual channels
of information, that Lord S-l-sb-ry has
been in correspondence with you on the
difficulties of the situation. I too am
oppressed by them, and do not know any-
one better than yourself to whom I might
go for counsel, i find thaL in my honest
endeavour to crown the edifice of my life's
work by a final attempt to pacify Ireland,
I have put my hand into a hornet's nest.
I seem to have rubbed everyone the wrong
way, "Whigs or Radicals, Moderate Liberals
or Immoderate Tories, it is all the same.
They all angrily shout at me. H-rt-nq-
t-n is sulky; Ch-mb-rl-n has devoted
himself exclusively to the cultivation of
orchids; Gr-nv-lle is doubtful; and
S-xb-rne openly hostile.
On the other hand, I get no forrader
with P-rn-ll. He will say nothing defi-
nite,—wants me to speak first, whereas I
want him to speak first; also the Marquis. There are some young men in the
House of Commons'who^flatter themselves that I am very easy to draw," and
perhaps there is some .truth in it. I cannot, without swelling with holy wrath,
hear some whipper-snapper like R-nd-lph or Ashm-d B-rtl-tt misquote my
Midlothian speeches, or put into my mouth words I have never uttered in the
House or elsewhere. But when it comes to a game such as that we are now playing,
it is, if I may say so, very different. There are, I am told, people who attribute
to me the scheme of coming down to the House on the day it opens, laving aU
my cards on the table, and leading off with the ace of trumps. It is only to you
in .confidence that I chuckle at'this notion. If they think so, let'em. But I do
not suppose you, who know me a little better, ever suspected such a thing; and,
bless you, Toby, when you see me in the House in the course of the next fort-
night, you will declare there never was such a mild innocent-looking gentle-
man. I have nothing to say on any subject, much less that of Home Rule for
Ireland. It is for the Government to declare their views. If, thereupon, Mr.
P-rn-ll has anything to say, the time will be convenient; and when the
Government and P-rn-ll have each committed themselves to a particular course,
then, perhaps, I may have something to say, but not till then, you may be sure.
It s a very pretty game, and a deeply interesting one, if you only knew what
has been going on during the past six weeks. There is the Marquis watching
me, and P-rn-ix watching the Marquis, with one eye upon me. As for me, I
say nothing, and have said nothing, in spite of all the silly stories you may read
in the newspapers. It is quite enough for me to cut down a tree here and there,
and to write an occasional article for the Magazines. I should be perfectly happy
and light-hearted if it were not for the perversity of my friends. They all will
insist upon assuming that I have tied myself by engagements, and that I will
split up the Party by some rash Bpeech delivered as soon as the House meets:
whereas, I have made no engagement, have not bound myself in the slightest
degree, and do not mean to take any course when the House meets, that would
embarrass my future action. Let other people burn their fingers first, and when
they start back then my time may have come.
That is my position, simply and plainly put. From it you will perceive that
all my troubles come from outside, and arise from people insisting upon knowing
more about my intentions than I do myself. \I confess I have tried to drown
recollection of these things in a course which, I am afraid, cannot be otherwise
described than as one of mad rioting. On Boxing Day we had a servants' ball
here, and if you had seen me going through " Sir Roger de Coverlet/" with the
youngest housemaid, you would not have thought I had a care upon my brain.
THE TRUTH ABOUT SOME RECENT CORRESPONDENCE
ON THE LYCEUM FAUST.
( To the Editor of the Times. Private and Confidential)
Sir,—I write to you because I have nothing much else
to do, and am delighted to get the chance of appearing in
print, so as not to De utterly forgotten, and also because,
as my name has a German ring about it, the public will
conclude that I must be an authority on anything con-
nected with Goethe. Yours, Schutz- Wilson.
P.S.—"Schutz" is good, isn't it?
(To the Editor of the Times. Private and Confidential.)
Sir,—Your Correspondent, Mr. Wilson, gives me an
opportunity of figuring in the Times, and getting an
advertisement for nothing. I am personally obliged to
Mr. Wilson. I should like to say something sharp about
"Shoots Wilson," or Frei-schiitz, by way of making a
hit, but as it would take me some time to think it out, I
must leave that jeu de mot for the present, and await a
chance later.
I wrote Faust to order. There were two difficulties I
had to get over. One was, that in the original there is no
genuine "actor's chance;" and the other was, that
Mephistopheles and Marguerite have no powerful scenes
together. Both these are necessities demanded by the
public, who pay to see Mr. Ihvtno and Miss Terry. So
with some considerable ingenuity, I invented a speech for
Mephistopheles in a rage, founding it on a few lines of
his in another part of the jj>oem. This was quite an inspi-
ration. Mr. Irvtno likes it immensely; so did the critios:
so do the public. Then I introduced him into the garden
for a tete-a-tete with Marguerite whence she expels him
with the sacred symbol, an idea which struck me as having
such a touch of originality about it as to amount to another
inspiration; and then I substituted him for the Evil Spirit
in the Cathedral. Mr. Irvtno and Miss Terry are satis-
fied, the public is satisfied, so am I; and who cares what
Wilson shoots? I haven't yet got this joke about his
name quite perfect; but no matter, a time will come.
Yours, W. G. Wills.
(To the Editor of the Times. Private and Confidential.)
Sin,—I couldn't see Schutz-Wilson and Wills
appearing in the Times, without my having a finger in the
pie. I've read Goethe, too. I've been at it night and
day since Schutz-Wilson's letter appeared, and I mean
to let the public know it. Irving's all right; he
always is; so's Wills's piece, though I don't care so
much about Wills: but I do like to show Henry Irvtno
that he has no more staunoh or loyal friend in the literary
and journalistic world, than his old companion—" Should
auld acquaintance be forgot ?"— Joseph Hatton.
P.S.—Capital chap Schutz-Wtlson. Such a good
name. If I had had that name when I was starting in
life, I'd have been the most celebrated man in Europe,
and a millionnaire by now. I consider the name of
Schutz-Wilson has been thrown awayon its present
possessor. I thought I'd arrange with wills to out in
first, as it keeps up the excitement. It would have been
poor journalistic taotios for our letters to have both
appeared on the same day in the same issue of the Times.
But how miserably Schutz-Wtlson sneaked out of it all
on Saturday last in an ordinary-typed letter hidden in a
corner of the Times. A man with such a name too!
Melancholy to see it so thrown away!

HUNTING PUZZLES.


FOUND! Trying to post himself up in the Geography. "No Name!" 'GONE AWAY!" And where are we now?
LETTERS OF AN EXPERIMENTALIST.
DOING WITHOUT THE BUTCHEH.
Sir,—All sagacious householders will have experienced lively
satisfaction at the fact that the farmers of Bedfordshire have been
dispensing with the services of the extortionate Middleman, and
undertaken the direct supply of Meat themselves. I am nothing if
not an Experimentalist, and this is what I did:—
I secured, last week, by negotiation with a farmer in one of the
Midland Counties, a " beast," that was duly delivered into my hands
at the Great Northern Station, King's Cross, where, accompanied by
a friend who had agreed to take a hind quarter, and who kindly
volunteered to assist me in the task of driving it home to my residence
at Walham Green, I repaired to meet it as arranged. We had
selected the evening as the most convenient and fitting time for our
first essay at cattle-driving, and having attached a rope to the
creature's neck, we got, with the exception of having become
entangled for some short time round a lamp-post, on the whole,
fairly out of the station. Our first difficulty occurred in the Euston
Road, where the beast, a fine full-grown ox, who seemed remarkably
fresh after its journey, apparently dazzled by the illumination, made
a dash into a chemist's shop, from which, after considerable commo-
tion, we managed, by the aid of two policemen, and giving it a drink
of soda-water in a pail, to remove it backwards on to the pavement.
Here we had pretty plain sailing for a time, and managed by hal-
looing well to people ahead, and by keeping to the back streets, to
get on with nothing much beyond the upsetting of an apple-stall
and a wayfarer or two, and frightening an old woman in the Bramp-
ton Road into hysterics. But hero again our beast gave us some
trouble, declining to move, until we at last resolved that, if the worst
came to worst, we would try to put it on the top of a four-wheeler.
On attempting this, however, it made a sudden bolt into.the interior
of a Fulham omnibus. The vehicle being fairly full, the occurrence
naturally occasioned some protest from the passengers, but the creature
could not be induced to retire, and so, by paying for seven inside places,
and giving my name and address for a summons to the conductor, I
managed to convey it to my house-door, where, with the assistance
of all the outside passengers, who lent a hand at its tail, we obliged
it, after a vigorous and prolonged effort, ultimately to dismount.
It was therefore close upon half-past one o'clock in the morning
before I managed to get it up the steps into the hall of my house.
It being a wet night, it became a question whether I should drive it
on into the back garden, where I had intended to put it up prior to
the "killing " the next morning, or allow it to have a shake-down in
a temporary bed of old newspapers in the back study; but as it
seemed inclined to be frisky, and did, in fact, in a few minutes,
clear the hall of the weather-glass, letter-box, and umbrella-stand,
I decided on the former, and by frightening it by banging it with a
tea-tray, finally, after a struggle of two hours and a half, succeeded
in driving it sideways down the garden-steps into its appointed
quarters, where I left it rolling on the flower-beds, and bellowing in
a way that must, I fear, have disturbed the neighbourhood.
The next morning brought annoyance with it, in the shape of a
letter from the friend who had undertaken to take half the beast
off my hands, and "to send some one to skin it and joint it properly
on the premises." He had written to me, backing out of the whole
thing, and saying, on second thoughts, he did not "see his way to
getting through a fortnight's beef all at once." This was a most
unpleasant surprise; but as the carpenter, whom I had sent round
for to superintend and execute the killing " was waiting for orders,
I hardly knew what to decide. I could scarcely face such an over-
whelming quantity of beef as would suddenly come on my hands;
and yet the state of the garden seemed to point to immediate action,
as all the beds and paths were trodden into a common pulp. So I
gave the order to the carpenter to proceed with his business.
After I had been waiting nervously for half-au-hour to hear what
he had done, he came in to say he did not think he could manage it.
After some delay, I borrowed a double-barrelled rifle, and managed,
at the ninth shot, to give the creature its quietus.
Of the subsequent proceedings I have little to say beyond that I
would, on the whole, counsel no one in future to "kill" on the
premises. You cannot with any comfort turn them into an
amateur slaughter-house. As to the meat, though we sent out fifty
Christmas Cards mentioning it to friends, we had so much of it on
our hands, that we had to make a hurried present of nearly the
whole of it to the Parish Authorities. As an Experimentalist, I am
convinced that in London we are not vet prepared to do without the
butcher. One Who Doesn't Quite Know.

my part, and spontaneous approach of hand to breeches' pocket—
noted, approvingly, by Conductor. Suddenly remember! Great shock.
Button up pocket, and sidle into 'Bus sheepishly, with a feeble
"Tha-a-nks, Bottleby!" Bottleby stares, astonished, and bangs
door violently. Is heard exchanging confidences with his driver
over the knife-board. Feel certain they are not complimentary to
me. Never enjoyed ride to Town less.
Tuesday.—Everybody asking what that is—meaning my Badge.
Find myself explaining, in feeble whisper. Can't carry it off like
Buster, who glories in the whole thing. But Buster is masterful—
and mean. Most uncomfortable day. Breeches-pocket-action grown
automatic by long habit; necessity of checking it continuallv
troublesome, and leads to peculiar jerkiness in my gestures. All
sorts of little difficulties turning up. Evervbodv at nome uncom-
fortable, from my Wife to Buttons. New Medo-Persic Ultimatum.
"A"o Christmas-boxes !" doesn't appear to work well. Everybody
seems either tearful or out of temper—some both. My old clerk
Mifeins most miserable. Know why. Thinks he has offended me.
Long to double his usual "vail," but mustn't. Cutlet at lunch
cold, and boots badly blacked by my favourite boy. But, per contra,
I have satisfaction of knowing I am "discouraging a practice
degrading to the spirit of manly independence which should domi-
nate the breast of every Briton, from Premier to Policeman." (See
Buster's Letter to the Times.) Satisfaction hardly so satisfying as
I expected, though, and I fancy I am more discouraged than the
practice. I'm sure I feel more degraded than the disappointed
expectants of tips look.
Wednesday.—Nephews, home from Eton, come to see me.
Awfully fond of boys, and generally get on capitally with them.
This time, however, a chill seems to have fallen over us. No lnrks,
no laughter! Not even the usual snowball down my neck. Even
that would have been some comfort. Frank's face, when I explain
the Badge, a study. Tell him it is " the principle of the thing, don't
yon know 'i" Says, "Ye-e-s!" but doesn't seem to see it. Used to
call me "Tip-oh Sahib." Have dropped that practice. Overheard
Bertie telling Frank they ought to spell it "Tip-owe," now.
Wounding very. But with that Badge, what can I do—or say? Boys
go early, leaving me miserable. Buster drops in, big and beaming.
Says the Badge has saved him 'an average of two-and-fourpence-
farthing on hour since ho donned it. Chortles over it till I feel I
could punch him with pleasure. Go nearer to a quarrel with Buster
than ever before. Go to bed in beastly temper with myself, and
everybody else.
Thursday.—That Badge is becoming a burden and a bore. People
are beginning to understand what it means.' If I had Buster's
bumptiousness, I could brazen it out. But I haven't. When people
look at me pityingly, or scornfully, according to their view of the
case, I wince, thus losing dignity as well as comfort. Life is becom-
ing a dreary negation, consequent on the necessity of saying " No!"
every five minutes or so. I had no idea what an affliction travelling
can become—in the absence of "tips." Talk about the comforts of
civilisation! I should say—altering the Poet Laureate slightly—
Comfort! Comfort bom of—gratuities!
Pleasure, I am convinced, is a matter of pour-boire. Degrading, of
course, to our common—our very common!—humanitv, but true.
Humanity feels it has a right to its appointed pay; it is the superero-
gatory and' the eleemosynary which make humanity obliging. Tell
Buster this. Buster snorts. Snorting is Buster's ultima ratio.
He says I am weak. I feel I would rather be weak—in his sense—
with a nice foot-warmer and somebody to awake me at my station,
than ever so strong, and uncomfortable, without. But the more that
Bodge becomes known, the more I am shunned or ignored, and the
more I suffer.
Friday.—Leave the Badge at home—accidentally, of course. First
person I meet is Buster. He points at once to my buttonhole, and
snorts. Explain that I've left it behind, by mistake, and suggest—
slily—that he should lend me his. To my horror he does so at once,
saying that he always carries a spare one in his purse, in case of
accidents. There's principle, there's persistency! But we ore not
oil Busters! As soon as I hove left him, put it in my purse. First
result. 'Busman greets me with a pleasant smile. Pass a most
tantalising day, everyone beaming on me expectantly at first, and
then freezing into cold uncomfortablencss on rinding that nothing is
forthcoming. Hove the satisfaction of snubbing a few of those ob-
trusive London touts who are always plaguing one with sham
services, for which they expect substantial returns. But this does
not make up for the number of real services which I am compelled
to accept, and ignore.
Saturday.—Send in my Badge and resignation as Member of the
"Anti-Tip League." Breathe freely again, and "tip" lavishly
all round. Meet Buster, who passes me without speaking. Another
blessing! Get "on terms" with everybody again like a shot.
Enjoy myself immensely. Decide that, though "tips" are often a
nuisance, and sometimes a degradation, yet in a world of hard and
often ill-paid work like ours, there are worse things. They ought to
be done away with, no doubt. So ought poverty, badly-requited
labour, unequally distributed wealth, pleasure-pinched destitution,
and swaggering selfishness. When these latter are abolished it will
be time enough to talk about abolishing " tips."
Mem.—I hear that Buster is the only remaining Member of the
"Anti-Tip League"!!!
THE RULE OF THE ROAD.
(Something about it, from a couple of last week's Diaries.)
Well, if this isn't enough to
make a Ratepayer savage, I should
like to know what is, that's all.
The state of the road is simply
disgraceful. Started this morn-
ing, to go to the office, and in ten
minutes after leaving home, ow-
ing to having to wade through a
drift, found myself soaked to my
knees. Home again and changed,
and started afresh, this time get-
ting hold of a four-wheeler with
two horses, that agreed to take
me for treble fare. Both horses
down several times, but drag on.
Stuck at last. Cabman says he
can't go on any further. Get out
and find it freezing hard. Pick my
way carefully, but presently'slip
backwards and sprain my right
ancle badly. Luckily an omni-
bus comes by, sliding and stagger-
ing, and I limp in. We creep on
for some time, but at length come
to a dead halt. Both horses are
down and we all have to get out.
Driver says he's not going " to
have any more of this fun," and
is "going back." He does. I
limp on citywards as well as I can.
Get into another drift, and am
again soaked to my knees. Try-
to walk quicker, and again slip
backwards, and this time sprain
my left ankle badly. Sit on a
frozen heap of snow, ond am now
waiting for a policeman to help me
on to a stretcher.
So the neighbourhood's snowed
up, and we Westrymen has got to
see to it. Anythink else, I should
like to know! Why, what '11
they be expecting of us next P To
take a broom and sweep it up our-
selves, I suppose? Not if I know
it—no, nor hiring a lot of fellows
to do it neither. Snow is snow,
everybody knows that, and, of
course, if it comes down heavy, it
sticks—and, why shouldn't it
stick? I asks. How can a Wes-
try be held responsible for that?
Clear it away, indeed. Who 's to
clear it away? Whj'j if it comes
to that, it will clear itself away.
Give it time enough, and it will
melt—any fool knows that. And
what are people to do in the
meantime? Why, slush through
it as best they can. That's what
the busses have to do and the
cabs; and, for the matter of that,
if a four-wheeler can't get along
with two 'osses driving tandem,
well, all I can say is, it must stay
where it is. Oughtn't we Westry-
men to try to get the muck moved
away? 'Ow 'i Where's the carts
to do it r* D'you think it's our
business to puzzle our 'eads over
a set out like this 'ere, because it
ill-conveniences a lot of chaps
going to the City and back?
Why, what do you think a
Westryman is made for? Not
for that, I can tell you.

A STORY FOR THE MARINES—AND OTHERS.
Captain Brownjones Robinson, R.N., paced the quarter-deck of
H.M.S. Junket, with a smile of satisfaction on his face. He had that
day received a letter of approbation from his superiors, heartily con-
gratulating him upon the efforts he had made in securing the efficiency
of the crew of his vessel.
"Well," he murmured, " I think I have deserved it. There is not a
man on the ship, from the First Lieutenant to the Junior Powder
Monkey, who is not of Chinese origin. Ah, Mr. Wing!"
The young Officer addressed touched his regulation cap with his
pig-tail, and stood at "attention."
?l Ah, Mr. Winq is all right?"
"You speakee my namey wrongy," replied theyoung Officer, with
a smile, child-like and bland. "They callee me Wing, but my namey
is Ah Wing."
"Well, Mr. Ah Wing is all right?"
"Unite, Sir," (returned the other, who only used the Chinese
method of speaking English at times. "The Starboard Watch is set,
and at seven bells we pipe the Port Division to quarters."
"And the marling-spikes, are they properly spliced to the spinaker
binnacle P"
"As tautly as if we were expecting a flock of Mother Carey's
chickens out of Davy Jones's locker."
And so the professional conversation continued until other duties
carried the Captain and his First Lieutenant to opposite parts of the
vessel.
Some weeks after the event just narrated had come to pass, the
Captain paced his State Cabin m evident trepidation.
Dear me!" he explained. "It is most annoying! Here, when
everything was going on so smoothly, all my arrangements are upset

Why I would give worlds for a fellow-countrvman. Even Sir

Alderman, and, I believe, 'something very good indeed in the
provision line' would be invaluable at such a moment! "|
From which it will be gathered that the unhappy Commander had
come to the very end of his resources. Hastily assuming his sword
and cap, he ascended to the quarter-deck. Tonis surprise, he found
the entire ship's company paraded.
"Calk my dead-lights!f' he exclaimed, "what is all this f"
"Me speakee for the crewey," said the First Lieutenant, adopting
the Chinese patois. Then he continued in ordinary English—
"Captain Bkownjones Robinson, I am deputed to say that it is our
opinion that we cannot fight yonder approaching gunboat. So there
is only one thhifj to be done—we must haul down the colours!"
"Never!" cried the Captain, excited. Then he implored them
to consider the services he had rendered, and the sacrifices he had
made, the instruction he had afforded.
"All you say may be correct," replied the ever-courteous First
Lieutenant, as he lowered the white ensign; "but you see, Sir, you
forgot, in teaching us everything else, to give us a few hints in the
practical parts of our profession. You see, Sir, you have taught us
everything—save how to fight!"
Change of Address.—The honoured name of "Our'Mr. Sam-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HARBOUR FOOTLIGHTS" AT THE ADELPHI.
Hem is a real fine young English melodrama, one of the brand new
sort. Great attraction! Two wicked .Squires (like a double harle-
quinade); and when one's down t'other comes on: and, dear me,
what a vicious villain the sinful survivor is to be sure—(there
is a "cup-of-cold-
poison" look about him
—and they call him,
consequently, Mister
"Beverage," as far as I
remember) —and how frank
and open are those gallant
tars, Lieutenant David
Kingsley, R.N., and Cap-
tains Nelson and Hardy
(who ought to kiss each
other, but don't), Why,
the very names bring the
sniff of the briny over the
Harbour Footlights! How
sweet is Dora, and how
pathetic is Lena! (Great
attraction again — Two
Columbines!) I feel for
the latter young lady at
once. When she returns,
Lena and Leaner. pale and thin, to her
ruined home, and says to
her more virtuous and better-fed sister," Look at me! Seewhatlam!"
The dainty Dora surveys the wasted form, and piteously exclaims,
"Oh, Leaner.'" Then we pity her all through, until, by her excel-
lent acting, she manages to secure some of the "fat" of the piece.
The characters in plays of this sort never swerve a hair's-breadth
from the type or mould into which they are poured in the introductory
Act, the wicked man never turneth away from his wickedness, nor
the comic man from his comicality. Dear old types! They all" behave
as such," and no nasty new departure mars their splendid familiarity.
So when Lieutenant Kingsley, Ji.N., with probably a poetical touch
of his ancestor the late Reverend Komancist, babbles in Act I. to his
sweetheart of the " dear old home," and "the sparkling blue sea,"
and the " singing birds," and the " long dark watches of the night,"
we are quite prepared to hear him in Act III. trot out the very
identioal "long dark watches of the night" on board his ship. I
wonder do sailors ever have "short bright moonlight watches"?
[No; probably American ones.—Ed.]
Another " dear old " peculiarity of melodramatic folk is, that after
talking capital cockney, or breezy sea-slang, or decent and sensible
modern English for many scenes, in a moment of excitement they
insist on soaring into unbounded and extravagant high-falutin. Thus
when the intrepid Lieutenant Terriss rushes off to the dear old Hall,


A Terries on the 8ea.
he exclaims, "I go to punish the villain who has injured me, and
rescue the girl I love! About which there is more comic bathos
than the clever actor is possibly aware of. "Eastward Ho!" would
be a better exit speech for a Kingsley. However, this Second Act is
the best of the bunch of five. Dora and Lena turn up trumps, so
does a generous Masher, with an eye-glass, and a morbid Bandit, with
the most awful of Mothers, "turns up" Wicked Squire No. 1. It is
all well played, and the concluding struggle, murder, and situation,
are of first-class curdling power. It is right to add, that when these
"enterprising curdlers, Messrs. Sims and Petitt, aren't a-ourdling,"
their capacity for innocent enjoyment is strongly marked.
The introduced comic episode is a feature of this school. It is a
little "excursion " after the " alarms." It is a sure test, may I say
a Criterion, of the work of the Messrs. S. and P. above mentioned.
In Act III., for instance, we have " the great original hat-trick, with
Hanlon-Lee business," the thrilling domestic drama of The Sad
Half-crown'; or, the Mother-in-Law and the Marine, and the grand
Naval Review, on board ship. "Point! Parry! Cut one! Slope!"
go the melancholy Marines, who have come ait because they are all
stern-looking men, and we are grateful that they do not slice off the
Conductor's head, or chop up his fiddlers. The Scene is a "Marine
Parade"; our artist has completed the super-mare suggestion.
The real point is, that there isn't any point in their gymnastic per-
formances—the Lord High Admiral might just as well nave made an
omelette in his cocked hat, as far as the play is concerned, and as
"Cut one!" "Cut two," was roared out by a bearded Bo'sn, who
looked very frightened to find himself in a playhouse, it occurred to
me that there was just one "Cut" omitted which would be worth the
whole lot put together; and this should be " Cut out!" This review
of Cutters would be more honoured in the breach than the observance.
Act IV. is gruesome. We have had piled-up horrors enough,
without being introduced to the Poetic Bandit's malignant Mamma.
Poor boy! no wonder he grew up badly, and drags his words so
desperately. The Bandit's Mater nas, of course, a fine tap of lofty
diction, considering her station in life. If she means to go out, she
observes, "Old as I am, I will go forth!" Why '' forth'?? I wish
she would go first, and not come back. After this, we have a combi-
nation of Arrah-na-Pogue cliffs and Colleen Baton waves, Turn of
the Tide situation, and hero and heroine in a picturesque attitude,
with a possibly prophetic shower of rice dashing over them, which is
exciting. How Lena got on such a ledge without breaking her
pretty neck is a mystery; but what of that? The Melodrama's laws
the Melodrama's patrons give, they swallow impossible situations
and bombastic moralities with really superb delight, and we must
not look for Sardou-subtleties in the school of Saxon simplicities and
Adelphi audacity.
From this point we get home rapidly. No time for episodes now,
and with one more change (that the dripping life-boat's crew must
have been glad of), we steer to the happy end by the red revolving light
of the title-role, or roll. The vigorously-hissed Hibernian, Mr. Beve-
ridge, is carted off, and he grins and Dears it as is his plucky wont,
and we applaud Miss Mart Rorke, and Miss Millward, and Miss
Kate Fayne, and the comic, or E. W. Garden, sailor, and sea-
manly Mr. Terriss and all his virtuous crew, and, as we stream out
to the Strand, like the waves that Britannia rules, we admit that,
despite the inflated dialogue, there are real honest moments when the
gulp comes and the mist rises in the play. [Is not our esteemed critic
alluding to some "honest moments" immediately after the play, say
supper-time ?—Ed.]
Just a suggestion. What is to become of poor dear Lena f True
that Terriss, R.N. (right noble!) has rescued her from an undula-
ting watery grave, trat
both her Squire and her
Bandit are dead, and it's
a dull prospect for her to
end her days in John
Nelson Maclean's cottage,
with only a swordfish and
some stuffed birds for
company. But that gene-
rous Masher with the eye-
glass, who goes about the
play lending people rolls
of notes, is to tne fore,
and there's the husband
for Lena! See to this,
Messrs. Sand P., and do
another good turn to " Al-
bion ;" and here's a long
and successful cruise to

But there is a " Liberal Movement in English Literature " to which
we are sure even Mr. Courthope could not object, and which Mr.
Punch urges upon the attention of his readers at this season; and
that is, the sending all our spare books, superfluous periodicals, and
supererogatory newspapers, to our Hospitals, Children's Homes,

movement—as liberal as possible—of literature in tluxt direction
cannot be open to objection from the most critical of Conservatives.

ROBERT ASTONISHED!
Well, I've been a thinking for sum time that it's rayther a rum
world, but it seams to me to be getting rummer and rummer ewery
day. I've seed a good many staggerers in my life, and herd a good
many stunners, but on last Fryday as ever was I herd not only our
own Lord Mare make a speech to a number of Forriners in what I
was told was the Frensh tung, for nuffin don't surprise me as a Lord
Mare does, weather its Greek or Lattin or Scotch, but ewerybody else
was all a gibbering and a jabbering away and nun of us waiters
coudn't understand a single word! Wen I arsked won werry respec-
tabel looking Mounseer if he woud take sum tea, he acshally smiled
at me and arsked for mercy! and wen I tried another Bmiler he shook
his ed and said, "no mercy!" I didn't arsk for mercy, why shood I?
but the Sherryff kindly came to my asistance and releeved. me of my
burden, and then gave me a few words of Welch as a kindly change!
Lucky it wasn't a dinner, or grayshus knows what we shood have all
dun. As for the Lord Mare's speech, it was that butiful that I
couldn't tell a word of it from the other frenchmen, witch I thinks
about the gratest complement I can pay his Lordship. An to
think as this werry Lord Mare is the reperesentif of the Puffijius
Halbion," as the Frenchmen calls it! With his usual good taste,
he didn't arsk not none of the Haldermen, nor none of the Common
Counsehnen—for they would ha' felt hout of their hellement in not
being able to say a word not to nobody, excep, of course, to hus,
tho' we shood ha' felt it rayther a relief.
There was one cappitul good Frensh joke made by tho Lord Mare
as set 'em all off a roaring. I couldn't in coarse understand it myself,
but I jined in so werry artily that one of the Forriners near me said,
ah, you understand French, which put me on my metal, so I said
only a little Mounseer, he then said I can speak English a little, and
the Lord Mare's joke was he once asked a Lady to kiss him because
he knew Greek! Well, how his Lordship could like to menshun the
little fo par in presence of the Lady Maress, et settera, I'm sure I
don't know. All I nose is I shouldn't have dared do so in quite
similar suekumstances. But as I said at the beginning, so I says at
the hend, it's a rum world, my masters. Robert.
AN AWKWARD CORNERER;
OR, VOTES AND QUERIES.
The (Low) Pressure Association having recently addressed a fresh
Circular to every Member of the House of Commons, asking for
answers to the following questions:—"Are you in favour of Home
Rule? If so, what sort of Home Rule do you propose to grant? If
not, why not i" has received the following, among other replies:—
Mr. O'Connor Clast (Radical Member for a slice of Hamshire)
says that he is not himself an Irishman, though his name might
imply so. He is not prepared to go quite the whole way with
the Parnellites; but, if the abolition of the Viceroyalty, the release of
all Irishmen under sentence of penal servitude, the .destruction of
Dublin Castle by dynamite, the appointment of Mr. Davitt as Chief
Secretary, and the affiliation of Ireland to the United States of
America, would be likely to satisfy the more moderate section of the
Nationalists, he, for his part, sees no reason why this instalment of
justice should not at once be granted.
Mr. Facing Foreways (Liberal Member for several Genteel
Suburbs) regrets the lack of clearness and definiteness in other
people's views on this subject. He himself is in favour of such steps
being taken as will give to the Irish people the control of such
matters as they ought to have the control of, while reserving to the
Imperial Parliament all those powers which are necessary for the
maintenance of the complete integrity of the Empire.
Sir Cawtius Bird, Bart. (Independent Conservative Member for
South-North-East Clodshire, whose length of service and well-known
political prudence have given him the title of "Grandmother of the
House of Commons") "prefers to await the opening of Parliament
before giving any detailed exposition of his views."
Mrs. Llewellyn Cadwallader Jones (wife of the Conservative
Member for the Llanfanfwrlch Division of Carnarvon) begs to say
that as all his sons and nephews are at present home from school,
Mr. Cadwallader Jones is prevented from answering the questions
by domestic affliction.
The Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone refers the inquirer to the first
five volumes of his Midlothian speeches for his opinion, and at
the same time considers that it is Lord Salisbury's place to state his
views on Home Rule.
The Marquis of Salisbury, K.G., thinks that it is the imperative
duty of Mr. Gladstone to answer these questions first, and he '11
wait till he has done so before stating his own views.
Mr. Parnell defers any exposition of his opinions until Lord
Salisbury and Mr. Gladstone have given theirs.
The Sub-Under-Secretary for the Colonies and Scilly Isles says
that, as he does not hold Irish Estates, and there is no Irish
vote in his Constituency, he does not care twopence whether Home
Rule is granted or not. He objects to his opinion (or his pay) being
drawn by anybody else.
Mr. Bucephalus Smith (Radical Labour Representative for the
Tanneries) writes that he will be "jolly well jiggered" before he
gives Home Rule to Irish Rebels. He would " a deal sooner" give
security of tenure to loyal Scotch Crofters and English farmers.
A Borough Member (who wishes his name withheld) thinks the
Leaders of both Parties ought to be ashamed of themselves, and that
a stringent law of Procedure should forbid Irish matters of any sort
taking up more than a fifth part of the time of Parliament in any
Session.
Mr. Twaddlem, Q..C. (Conservative Member for Fickleton) argues
that the question should be approached in a judicial spirit, which he
will be much more able to do when he receives the vacant Judgeship
which (as the P. A. must acknowledge) is his by unquestionable right.
A number of Representatives return the circular unanswered,
and—the (Low) Pressure Association regrets to remark—in unstamped
envelopes.
MUCK IN THE HAYMARKET.
Sir,—I never understood what the degradation of the Stage meant
until I saw Mr. Barrymore's Nadiezda at the Haymarket. It is a
repulsive story, undramatically told, and the rule of the heroine is
absurdly acted by a foreign lady who does not possess one single
qualification for the part,—that is, as far as I saw it, for I only had
patience to sit out the Prologue and the First Act. I have only to
thank her for one thing, and that is, that she was almost unintelligible.
What was the Licenser of Plays about, to permit the production
of so revolting a piece? Palais Royal farces, with their doubles en-
tendrcs, and immoral, but farcically improbable plots, which raise a
laugh and do no harm, because it is all meant as a joke from beginning
to end, fall under the Censor's restrictions, and the Lord Chamber-
lain has before now, in the interests of morality, insisted on the extra
ladies in burlesques and ope'ras bouffes having their skirts lengthened,
but he or his agent is silent when such a play as Nadjezda is given
him to read,—a play which, it must be as unpleasant for the per-
formers to act as it is for the audience to see.
That it was cruel to guy, mock at, and hiss the Actress and Actors
on the first night, I admit, and sincerely pity them. It was Lynch
law. I saw it on the third night. I did not see one redeeming point,
except Mr. Beerbohme Tree's make-up. Mr. Barrymore's young
Englishman was an offensively effusive cad, and the American young
lady obtrusively vulgar. This latter character may possibly be true
to nature; all I can say is that such a type is contrary to my own
experience of American ladies. It maybe correct for all that: I hope
not. Perhaps if it were redeemed by wit, it might be tolerable. Mrs.
John Wood would be an authority on such a subject. Ere this letter
is published, this sordid, objectionable play will, I should say, have
disappeared for ever from the boards. Steel Nibbs.

ATTITUDE OF THE VESTRIES.
January 6, 188C.
Mr. Wilson
Claudian Ju-
nius Brutus
Barrett, who,
it may not be ge-
I nerally known, is
acting at the
Prince s s's
Theatre (adver-
tisement gratis)
as the Ilodman
Out, announces
a romantic drama
"of the time of
Cromwell." Is
Mr. W. B. mo-
destly going to
play "Charles
his friend"?—
or will he take
the great Crum-
mies—we should
say the great
Cromwell's—
part himself?
And then there's
another drama,
"the scene of
which is," says
Truth, ''to be
laid in Greece."
This seems slip-
pery ground.

Ouly their promise one can hardly tell
By this first " tutti."
How many old familiar forms we missJ
How many more or less agreeable voices!
Where's Warton's bass? Well, on the

A happy loss, in which the world rejoices.
But Caink's agreeable chirp sounds now no
more.
Neither does Lawson's gay, if watery,
twitter:
Russell's exclusion is no doubt a bore,
Power's loss is bitter!
And many another pleasant pipe is mute.
And many another blatant horn is muffled.
Well, well, with destiny who may dispute?
There's mighty little use in being ruffled.
Lots of fresh voices swell the Choir's full ranks.
Will they go in for melody or blether?
Will they essay eccentric vocal pranks,
Or sing together?
Their programme is, at present, little known,
Their repertoire s untried, their power
uncertain.
They '11 need first-rate conducting; that is
shown
Almost before the rising of the curtain.
Who's equal to the task? A motley band,

MODERN PANTOMIME.
(By an Old Fogey.)
In Pantomimes, in ancient days,
We gave enthusiastic praise
To Harlequin and Clown;
But now the Spectacle's the
thing.
And ballet-dancers in a ring
The talk of all the Town.
Now long processions throng the
Of Beauties, or of Kings and Lords,
And mimic war they wage;
It seems to me that very soon
Poor Columbine and Pantaloon
Will vanish from the Stage!
We miss the dearClown'sbuttered
slide.
No longer does he deftly hide
Unhappy Bobbies' hats;
He's not so agile as of yore,
His wondrous jumps delight no
more,
And who has seen "the sprats "?
The Comio Scenes are shortened
now,
More time for dancing to allow,
And scenic changes please.
We've "Dreams of Beauty,"
"Realms of Bliss;"
I wonder do the children miss
Each old amusing "wheeze"?
The glories of the Stage to-day
Are won in quite another way,
But I would fain forego
Each gorgeous and expensive
"set,"
For fun that I shall ne'er forget,
More humour and less show.
We 're great upon historic dress
We see much female loveliness
In costumes of the time;
But surely, when all's said and
done,
There's far too little honest fun
In Modern Pantomime t
Another "Armstrong Case."—We mean the Pigeon one at the
British Museum. Why did not one of the most recent and youngest
of the Correspondents on this subject sign himself "Georgy Porgy

receive from the Museum Authorities and from the Doves? Why,
from the first, the reward of "Three Acres " for himself to cultivate;
and, from the Doves, " The Coo."
In the supposed recent discovery of " a fish with four legs" there
there is nothing startlingly novel. Who hasn't heard of a Dog-fish?
How could it be a Dog-fish without four legs? The Dog-fish comes
under the recent Police order, and may not go out without a mussel.
LATEST FROM BURMAH.
{From our Special UfUh General Prendergast.)
Bhamo, Christmas, 1885—86.
Here we 'are! Beautiful place, full of curiosities. Would
describe them, but the Native terms might g^et mixed through
travelling so far by telegraph. Had a fine time of it. Plum-
pudding, mince-pies—or rather their Burmese equivalents. Keep
details until we meet.
The General as popular as ever. Most admirable man. Full of
spirits and fun. Brave and beautiful as a lion. Don't be angry
at the expense incurred by wiring these items. Of course the
General does not want me to praise him, but as my telegrams are
submitted to the scrutiny of a Military Censor, I wish to insert news
likely to be passed. I think my testimony to the excellence, the
gallantry, the nobility of the greatest General of the age, will
pass. If it doesn't, let me know.
And now you would like some military news? I am sorry to say
that I cannot help you. Of course, the Campaign is enormously diffi-
cult. Everyone knows that the Burmans outnumber us by millions
to one, and have cannons and rifles immeasurably superior to any we
can boast, and moreover, are commanded by the ablest strategists that
ever existed. I could tell you a great deal more about the war1—even
what we haven't done, and are not going to do—but General Prxn-
dbrqast says I mustn't.'
OLD ENGLISH WINTER.
(And Verses.)
Chtckweed about my garden grew,
The while this time that Yule was green;
Past the Old Year into the New
It lived, so sprightly to be seen.
Mcthought it seemed a merry note,
And symptom of a season mild,
So therefore to the papers wrote
To get it among their news compiled.
Sing hey, sing ho to the leafless tree
When the fields be bare
And the weed that's rare,
Is as good as the Giant Gooseberrie!
But all on a night the snow came down,
And a hard frost did thereon succeed,
Mv green was therewithal done brown,
With a sorry ending to my sweet chickweed.
What change to-morrow's wind will blow
No Clerke of the Weather to tell is good;
Then, marry, my gamecocks, don't you crow
Until ye be all well out of the wood.
Sing hey, &c.
RATHER PERSONAL.
The Pope, in his Latin letter to Prinoe Bismarck, published in last
Saturday's Times, addresses him as " Amplissime Princeps." It is
admitted, that a portly bearing does not decrease with age, but his
Highness cannot surely have become so stout as to warrant his
being styled "Amplisswius; " and even were the fact so, and
had he grown into a. Persona Greater," it is hardly fair of his Holiness
to allude to it so pointedly. Perhaps the Pope, whose reading in all
languages is very varied, may have had in his mind our own
Shakspeare's description of Cardinal Wolsey as "a man of most
unbounded stomach, and so applied it to Prince Bismarck. Ad-
missible, however, as a recognised form of courteous etiquette, the
superlative "Amplissimus" still conveys a double entendre, and
possessing a keen sense of humour, how Leo, when he wrote this,
must have roared—to himself!
"OLD MISCELLANY DAYS."
None, 'twas thought, could,
In old times, by chance, tell any
Stories as good,
As in Bentley's Miscellany:
Sure that verdict was right,
For we've nothing but praise
For the varied and bright
Old Miscellany Days!*
• On hearing this title, a very High Church old lady observed that she
should certainly order it at once, as she "remembered Miss Sellon per-
fectly, and these reminiscences would be of the greatest interest." The
good old lady thought the title was " Old Miss Sellon-y Days."

"The letter which we publish to-day from a

He declares that the British men-of-war on the
China station, 'from the flagship down to the
smallest gunboat, are overrun with Chinese,' not
employed as mere supernumeraries or common
labourers, but forming an integral part of the
establishment, and wielding authority over British
sailors and marines."—Times.
Ye Mariners of England
Who watch our distant seas,
'Tis very odd that you should be,
The half of you, Chinese.
It scarcely fits our notions
To have you down below:
And though your keep, perhaps, is cheap,
The news comes like a blow:
To think we've got a Mongol Jack
Gives one a dreadful blow!
The Spirits of our fathers,
Oh wouldn't they just rave,
If thus upon the Estimates
They spied a dodge to save.
The men who under Nelson fought
Were Bill and Jack and Joe;
D'you think that Lung and Hang and Chtng
Can deal as stout a blow?
Not they! They 're not the chaps to deal
A good stout English blow.
But Britain " Needs no bulwarks."
What, if exposed her guns,
And cracked her iron-plated sides ;—
Behind them are her sons.
At least 'twas once her modest boast;'
But now a motley show
Of foreign sweepings crowd her decks,'
And lay her honour low:
For, surely, if they had to fight,
They'd lay her honour low.
So p'raps "My Lords " will take it up,
And to the matter turn,
And all the ins and outs of it
Somehow contrive to learn.
For honest Jack to scare away,
Because he's set below
A sallow-faced Chin-Chin, doth make
The public wind to blow;
So look to it, My Lords, or else
The public wind will blow!

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FIIOM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

ousb of Commons, Monday Night.—To-
morrow Parliament opens, and I have tired
myself out in advance. Been with Peel
all day arranging a little pageant, so that
the new Reformed Parliament may open
with what Joseph Oillis calls "ay claw."
Can't quite say whose was the happy
thought—Peel's or mine. It arose out of
conversation on Lord Mayor's Shows,
especially that at Dublin. Why should
plain Lord Mayors have Tradesf proces-
sions, bands of music, elephants, and Mr. Sanger, whilst the House
of Commons, principal assemblage in the world, should meet in kind
of helter-skelter manner. Members dropping in after a go-as-you-
please race across Palace Yard?
Peel said "Certainly ;" and then we went to work to devise
something worthy of the occasion.
The new House is essentially a "Working-Man's House. The
Country Gentleman has been pretty well wiped out. I do not, of
course, mean that we are all orny 'anded, but most of us earn our
own living, and this is the germ of the idea. A Trades' Procession
to rendezvous, say at Trafalgar Square, and march down Parliament
Street into Palace Yard. March round three times, then up West-
minster Hall, and so into the House. Here's a rough draft of the
Procession :—
House of Commons' Police, with their Band.
Inspector Denning on horseback (legs tied underneath, to avoid
accidents).
Bankers (25).
(To the slow music of the Band, they draw cheques as they walk
along, and hand them to the appreciative crowd.)
Gentlemen of the Long Robe (110)_, arrayed in Wig and Gown.
(Though each Member carries a Brief, this will be the longest
part of the Procession, Barristers forming close upon one-
sixth of the whole force of the New Parliament,)
Brewers and Distillers (24)
(Coope'd up in a large lorry flying a banner bearing the device,
"Down with the Excise ! ").
Builders and Architects (6)
(Walking arm-in-arm behind a cart, on which there are models of the
New Houses of Parliament and other Industrial Dwellings).
The Mace,
(Carried between the Serjeant-at-Arms and Mr. Bradlaugh).
Mr. SPEAKER,
(with Train-bearer).
The CnAPLAiN and the Hot-Water Engineer.
Civil and Mining Engineers (6).
(These Gentlemen will give practical illustrations of their skill by
blowing up the Home Office as they pass.)
Colliery Proprietors (16). (" Coal very cheap to-day ! ")
Crofters' Representatives (5).
(These Gentlemen have been kept without food for five days, and have
declined to pay their rent.)
Diplomatists and Government Officials (23).
(Their salaries will be reduced pari passu with their advance.)
Medical Profession (14).
(These Gentlemen, as they walk along, will administer to each other
pills and boluses, black draughts, and other condiments.)
Estate and Life Assurance Agents (4),
(Who will distribute Prospectuses of their various Institutions.)
Naval Officers (7) in full fig.
Miscellaneous crowd of Members, not engaged in bi
singing, " We 're got no work to do."
Twelve Barrel Organs'.
Me and Peel rather think this will fetch 'em. What's the use of
having a new Reformed Parliament unless you introduce it with
some startling effect?
FIGARO AT HATFIELD.
A correspondent of the Figaro, signing himself " Dr. F. Cop-
pini," in the number of that amusing French Journal for the 6th of
January, writes an account of his staying as a guest at Lord Salis-
bury's. He found fault with the arrangements at table, and
according to our livelv neighbour, the " Vie de Château, " must be
singularly cheerful. Here is an extract :—
"Lord et lady Salisbury se placent aux extrémités do la table, quand
il n'y en a qu'une; les autres invités arrivent quand cela leur plait et se placent
où ils veulent. On échange à peine un petit salut avec les maîtres de la
maison, et la conversation est rarement, bien rarement générale. Imaginez
une table d'hôte, et vous aurez l'idée exacte de cette singulière manière
de faire chez nos voisins Dernièrement la duchesse de Man-
chester me demandait ce que je trouvais de plus singulier dans leurs
habitudes anglaises: ' Celle,' repondis-je, 'd'une maîtresse de maison n'adres-
sant pas la parolo à ses invités, échangeant à peine avec eux un salut de
politesse; voici, ajoutai-je, quinze jours quo lady Salisbury et moi n'avons
pas échangé un mot.'"
"Why this coolness between hostess and guest? No wonder that a
little later on he says :—
"On parle beaucoup de la grande liberté qui distingue l'hospitalité
anglaise. Pour un Français, elle finit par devenir un poids."
He then makes a touching complaint, with which we thoroughly
sympathise, though rarely—very rarely—has it ever occurred to our-
selves to have to bewail the absence of these necessities of civili-
sation. Speaking of the breakfast " le premier dejeuner —which,
very freely translated, might be taken as "The Premier's Break-
fast "—he thus describes :—
"Ce premier déjeuner, comme le lunch, se sert d'une façon spéciale. Comme
les convives ne sont pas tenus à l'exactitude, les domestiques sont congédiés
au bout d'un quart d'heure. Le plats chauds sont sur des réchauds, placés
sur une immense servante, à l'une des extrémités de la pièce, ainsi que le
café et le thé. Le premier déjeuner se fait sans vin. Poisson, oeufs, rognons
et poulets à la diable (deviled chickens), gelées, beurre et petits pains
français."
The "Premier" doesn't do badly at his déjeuner. But then,
à propos of Lunch, comes the writer's grievance :—
"On a des serviettes pour ce repas; l'on n'en a pas pour le lunch qui est un
repas aussi important cependant que le dîner chez nous, et où l'on sert beau-
coup de légumes, des plats à sauce, des entremets; j'ai fini par demander la
raison de cette anomalie fort gênante. Il parait qu'à l'origine, le lunch était
une légère collation qu'on prenait debout; plus tord, on a fait monter cette
collation dans son appartement; on a trouvé ensuite plus pratique de de-
scendre pour la prendre en commun; la collation, étant devenue de jour en
jour plus importante, a pris le6 proportions d'un grand repas: mais on n'a pas
encore pris la serviette."
The history of the origin of Lunch is deeply interesting. It is also
interesting to know that in Paris they have now the verb "luncher,"
and that ladies invite their friends to " a five-o'clock."
The finish of dinner seems to have been as inspiriting and festive
as heart could wish :—
"Après le diner, servi à la française, sauf quelques petites modifications très
anglaises, les femmes se lèvent et sortent du salon en observant les préséan-
ces de rang sur le chapitre desquelles on ne plaisante pas en Angleterre, ce qui
est bien curieux pour un Français. Les hommes restent: c'est le pass-wine,
ils causent en buvant. La Reine, alors qu'elle était jeune femme, avait voulu
faire perdre cet usage. Elle dut y renoncer sur les conseils de lord Mel-
bourne. Chez lord Salisbury, qui est très sobre et ne fume pas, le pass-
wine n'a lieu que les jours de grande cérémonie et pendant les parlenientary-
parties. Autrement, tout le monde sort de table en même temps et se rend
dans la galerie et la bibliothèque où l'on sert le eafé et le thé.
"Pendant les fêtes de Noël, il y a un petit orchestre qui joue pendant le dîner
et la soirée; ou danse si l'on veut.
"Les autres jours, on joue au whist, au tric-trac. Je me mettais au piano et
la plupart des autres invités prennent un livre. Je n'ai jamais pu me faire à
cet usage."
It is pleasant to think that Lord Salisbury is "très sobre et ne
fume pas." How different from the late Prime Minister. The
"Pass-tcine" is evidently one of the peculiar pastimes at Lord
Salisbury's. His Conservative Lordship seems to have kept a
Liberal table specially at breakfast.
But for real rollicking jollity, our French friend ought to have been
invited to one of the Liberal Premier's breakfasts in Downing Street.
Those were days, if you like! Then the "Pass-tea" and "Pass-
muffin" were the pass-words. Ah, dear us! those were rantis
roarin' times! Let us hope they will return, and that Dr. Cofpi*1
will be invited there to see and report.

JACK'S ALIVE!"
(About the Gaiety, from "Niblet.")
Sir,—Mr. Hollingshead's "sacred lamp" is flaring up once
more. The daring Duumvirate, Messrs. Stephens and Yardley,

Lea Deux A-Jacks!
have followed.the traditions of previous "sacred lamp-oil-and-local-
colour-men," at the Gaiety, and produced a rattling and rollicking
show. There are some old jokelets and an old tune or so, but I
rejoice to add, old faces in it as well. There are our old friends the
unhappy Cobbler and Cricketer puns that are ruthlessly and remorse-
lessly worked out to the "last," and the "wicket." Once a fine old
paternal pun of this sort sets off, do we not instinctively know that
its sisters and cousins and aunts are crowding after it, and because I
five an instant's laughing welcome to a dear old familiar joke, I
on't see why I should be forced to entertain all its poor relations.
Again, with all profound aesthetic respect for our " Oscar," I do not
see what point is gained by his harmless name being inserted between
"Jonathan " ana "Wild." Still, as there was necessarily a Wild
in the story, the temptation to bring in Oscae was, I suppose,
irresistible.
Miss Faeeen, as far as the Gaiety is concerned, has been a-rcstine
herself, and it is rather hard on her that, on her return, she should
be so frequently arrested as she is when playing, as she only can do
it, Jack Sheppard. She comes back to pastures old, bringing an
excellent tail behind her; for indeed we must go back to the
Misses Constance Loseby and Tremaine period to find such a
singing company as is now gathered together on these boards.
e scenery is effective, specially The Housetops; but here, where
there was excellent opportunity for practical
fun, the chance is lost, and except for Mr.
Leslie sitting on the spikes of.' the prison
wall, nothing is done to raise a smile,—at least
as Dp. Barnardo, or Bucellas, or one of those
gentlemen in Hamlet who saw the Ghost, says,
"Not when I saw it!"
Mdlles. Marion Hoob, Wadman, and Mr.
Leslie are a tuneful triad, and raise the show
to operatic level. Its descriptive title is not
peculiarly happy; they call it a Burlesque-
Operatic-Melodrama. It isn't a melodrama
and it burlesques nothing. It is an opers-
^ \\ bouffe pure and simple,—which cannot be said
V ^ for most operas-bouffes,—and there is no need
V\\ of polyglot pother about its christening. How-
j\\ ever, the story, as far as Jack is concerned, is
\ well told; but the Thames Darrell and Wini-
'"' frid Wood part is a trifle misty.
Its music, like the society in the " Cave of
Harmony," is somewhat mixed, and I am not
sure that it was wise to turn on the "Seven
Champion Composers of Choral Christendom."
you Still, it did my neart good to hear our one boy,
-!" our James rolling out the old song sung in
the melodrama of long long ago. By the way,
ancient song, first sung in the original drama oiJack Shep-
. 1 at the Adelphi, obtained five genuine encores; so, j udging by this,
where was the use of engaging the Seven Champion Composers, whose
united efforts don't come to much beyond prettiness? All the young
Dookes and Dooohessee" in the stalls warmed to this ditty of

Blueskin's, rand accepted the sensible'social warning conveyed to
them, to be sure that all is their own as they touchesses," as they
rolled home in their gilded chariots, singing "Tooral, li-ourat.
ti-oddity." Mr. James is too subdued and subfuse. "Blue-devils,"
need not necessarily attend " Blue-skin," and if this capital actor
doesn't mean to pose as a burlesque "Melancholy Jacques-James,"
or " Dismal Jemmy," he must put aside memories of comedy successes,
be jovial as he can be, and as for that wig, and fixings generally,
"Blew the lot!" Miss Wadman is brilliant and earnest as Thames
Darrell; indeed the brightness and tunefulness throughout are
mainly due to her. Miss Hood looks like a delicate mediaeval
maiden stolen from a stained-glass window, and is sweet and saintly.
Mr. Leslie might easily be mistaken in make-up and manner for
Mr. Terry, onlv he has the advantage over the latter in singing, as
his decision and clear crackling voice are of the highest possible
value; and so are his crackling fingers. Mr. Odell's disguise is
funny, but he is indistinct, and his method is desperately decrepit.
A dance by Mr. Willie Waede and Miss Silvia Grey is one of the
best things in the piece. Paterfamilias need have no fear of a visit
to this happy Sheppard turning out a boy-burglar, or a nursery
highway mannikin.
SOMETHING ROTTEN IN THE STATE OF DENMARK ROAD.
If any patriotic Briton, proud of his country's "crowning common
sense," desires to demonstrate it to any Intelligent Foreigner of his
acquaintance, let him take that Intelligent Foreigner—thickly shod,
and carefully mackintoshed—to the "Approach." as it is humorously
called, leading from Denmark Road to the Camberwell Railway
Station. If the I. F. is not astonished, it will be clear that he has
resided for some time in our " City of Dreadful Dirt," and, like the
bulk of its long-suffering Citizens, has grown absolutely proof
against astonishment of any kind.
This Approach—excellent joke that!—combines the varied ad-
vantages of a Dismal Swamp, a Dust Yard, and a Drain. It is
divided—conventionally, and for the fun of the things—into roadway
and footpath. It is not possible, however, to determine either where
one begins and the other ends, or which of the two is the more
dismally detestable. The chronic condition of each may be described
as Slush. Sometimes the Slush is sticky, sometimes it is sloppy,
but, in all but the very driest or frostiest weather, it is always Slush.
After long-continued drought or frost, it is occasionally improved
into a boulder-sprinkled dust-heap, or a hummocked ice-field.
When, in its quagmire condition, the roadway becomes absolutely
impassable, some one pitehes a lot of stones and shards pell-mell into
the mud thereof, to be trodden in by such traffic as is unhappily com-
pelled to pass that way. When the footway gets more than ankle-
deep in mire, a feeble-looking official is to be seen scooping damp
drift from the road, which he plasters over the path, pats down with
a shovel, and leaves to be reduced to slime by the first rainfall.
The Camberwell folk may like it, at any rate (and the Rates are not
exceptionally low) they seem to put up with it. But the wayfarer
who alights casually at the Camberwell Station will not be so easily
pleased. But then what can he do? Borrow a shovel, and begin
the work himself? Perhaps this is the humorous idea of "The
Authorities."
Mission to Deep-Sea Fishermen.—This sounds practical. Of
course the deeper the Sea-fishermen the greater the need of the
Mission.
The usual Ball of Rejoicing was held by the Frozen-Out Fox
hunters, on the first night of the thaw. This time-honoured festivity
is always oalled The Melton Snow Ball.
MnT AT NOME
HIS.LAST APPEARANCE.
In behalf of an excellent charity, H.R.H. Duke Orpheus,
Admiral-in-Chief of the Mediter-
ranean Fleet, once more drew bow
at St. James's Hall on Saturday
night. Bravely did our gallant
Admiral lead the amateur orches-
tra; daringly did he alone engage
in a hand-to-hand combat with a
X jbby-ligato, whence, to the great
delight of the Suobby-ligati, he
issued undefeated. Sharps and
flats fell before him, till the last
bar was reached in triumph.
Bravissimo! it was a thrilling
fight. We may mention inciden-
tally that the vocal accompani-
ment was sung by a somebody

WHY HE LEAVES.
Lord Carnarvon's departure from Dublin Castle is said to be due
to the fact that—
He doesn't exaotly know why, but somehow the place doesn't suit
him;
He suffers so much there from chronic catarrh;
He is obliged to attend the meeting of the Cabinet Council;
He has received a telegram from Lord Salisbuky, saying, "You
are no use, and had better come out of it";
He is afraid, if he stays, the Lord Mayob will not attend his next
drawing-room;
He rather bkes the idea of being "the last of the Viceroys " j
He wants to meditate on the further working of the suspension of
the Crimes Act, from a distance;
He thinks, as he has been in office nearly six months, it is about time
for him to resign;
He is anxious to see how the country will get on without him;
He has always been fond of dropping out of a Government;
And finally that, in so doing on this occasion, he is only antici-
pating by a few weeks the action of all his colleagues.
The subjoined advertisement appears in the pages of a
contemporary:—
WANTED, a Male Night ATTENDANT, capable of playing 1st
Violin.—Apply to the Superintendent, County Lunatic Asylum, &c.
There is so much mystery in the picture here suggested, of this
midnight first-fiddle discharging his simultaneous duties as attend-
ant on a set of County lunatics, that one wonders whether the super-
intendent has been deputing the advertising of the establishment to
some of the inmates. The place appears to be called Hatt-on. A
more appropriate name for it would be Tile-off.

Where and how we should earliest meet her,
What were the words she would deign to say,
When we might next have a chance to greet her
We knew not, but we know to-day.
With her loyal People gazing upon her,
Streaming on where her face is seen.
She comes, the Lady we all would honour,
And the shout rings out of, "The Queen
The Queen!"
We did not dream of this pageant stately,
But greet its coming with great delight.
A'crisis great should be fronted greatly,
And so her presence is surely right.
'Tis a time of trouble, 0 Royal Lady!
Dark signs of danger ahead are seen;
But whenever it comes it shall find us ready,
To do our devoir, our Queen!
Our Queen!
We must be watchful, not melancholy,
Courage rises poor fears above,
Whether our birth be lofty or lowly,
We 'Ll all dare all for the land we love.
You may trust its soil to our loyal keeping,
Ever your strength upon ours may lean,
Traitors shall fall or, like worms, go creeping,
Ere they hush our shout of, "The Queen I
The Queen!"
Shocking!
Mrs. Arthur Arnold, who has been cigarettlv—no,

smoking, will be shocked to see the following advertise-
ment from the columns of the Daily Telegraph:—
ALADY with small capital, wishes to JOIN a widow
lady or married couple in a cigar or other light business.
References exchanged.
The Lady is certainly a moderate smoker if she wishes
to share her cigar with " a widow lady or married couple."
But stay! That "other light business" possibly means
a bundle of cigarettes or a big pipe to be passed round!
It is too dreadful!
A YOUNG MASTER AMONG THE OLD 'UNS.
(At Burlington House.)
"Wright of Derby "—his Pictures. The chief one is " Orrery;"
and to this we should have assigned a special place of honour in a
Chamber of Orrories. To anyone unacquainted with the subject, it
appears to represent "a Lecture on Crinoline," given by an elderly
gentleman to some youthful pupils, while a foreman in the business
is taking notes for measurement. The scene is lighted, apparently,
by naphtha lamps. According to Mr. Seymour Haden's letter in the
limes, injustice was dono by the Academy to Wright by putting
Garvey, a painter of gentlemen's seats," over his head. This, as
reading oddly, is rather a startling piece of information,—quite a
Haden's surprise. But whatever mignt have been Garvey's merits,
they need not have been transcendent to have insured his being
Ereferred to Wright of Derby,—that is, to judge from the specimens
ere exhibited. As far as admitting his works at all, the public verdict
might be thus summarised,—Wright of Derby,—wrong of Academy.
Let us call on a few of the Old Masters.
First visit No. 184. Henry VIII., by Holbein. Could this sensual
cruel-looking, heavy-jowled weazel-cyed scoundrel in jewels and
gold, ever have been, when a youth, the handsomest young man of his
time? Or even among the handsomest? Where, in the name of all
that's charming, could ever have been his fascinations? Yet, like
the Man of St. Ives, he had several wives, and nearly all these ladies
lost their heads on his account. No wonder the Reformation came
in his time, for no one could have wanted reforming more than this
most Gracious Monarch and Defender of the Faith. Justice is now
meted out to him: and this unhung scoundrel is hung at last, No.
184, Gallery No. IV., of Burlington House.
Go for consolation to No. 123, by Lionardo da Vinci. "La
Madonna del basso rilievo." This is lovely. But for the rigid, angular,
melancholy-mouthed Saints and Angels of the ancient Masters, who
can honestly express admiration?
Pay a long visit to No. 89, by Vandyck. It is a " Portrait of a
Gentleman, and is highly finished, though only the picture of a man
"done in the ruff." If it were not so evidently the portrait of a
gentleman, it might have been described as " The Portrait of a Ruff."
But, heavens! No. 90!" An Interior," by Jan Steen. What
a family! Boors pigging it! The Lowest of Low Dutch!—and yet
not so very low, except in manners, or rather in the absence of any-
thing like civilised manners. What says the Official Guide-Book P
"On the opposite side of the table is seated a Gentleman, with his
leg in the lap of a Lady, who is offering him a glass of wine."
Ladies and Gentlemen, just look at these specimens of a " Lady and
Gentleman." Wouldn't you rather see a classic study from the
nude model (by permission of our excellent and undefeated friend,
Mr. J. Clothes-Horsley) than this bestial scene, no matter how
perfect the painting may be?
Did we regret Mr. Van Beers having chucked away his talent on
those clever, eccentriCjbut, after all, worthless pictures exhibited in
the Salon Parisien? Why, certainly. And so we may well be sorry
that Jan Steen should have found nothing more to his taste for por-
trayal than the manners and customs or those loutish schnapps-
drinking, beer-swilling Low Dutchmen.
On one of these go-loshy, gosloshy London wintry westry days go
to the Turner Collection, where all is sunshine and warmth, except
one or two, which can be left for another visit, when it's fine outside.
After this, cross over to see Claude's " Sunset," then button up your
coat, pull tight your muffler, and get back home again as quickly as
possible. An revoir!
We have heard and read so much of the astuteness of the French
Police that we shall watch the search for the murderer of Monsieur
Barreme with unusual interest. The tragic story has commenced
with just such a chapter as might have opened a novel like La Main
Coupie, or Le Crime de V Omnibus, or Le Crime de F Opera. How

SCARCELY REALISE WHAT IT 18 NOT TO KNOW WHERE TO FIND AN INVESTMENT WHICH WILL

A LITTLE GIRL'S SAD STORY!
Dear Mr. Puncd,
I know that you are always very kind and good in everything that affects us
children, especially where it is something of a perfectly dreadful character, such as I am
going to describe to you for the good of all little girls like myself who go out in the cold
winter nights to beautiful evening parties dressed in all our beautiful dresses and hoping to
get plenty of nice partners.
My elder sister Fanny tells me, she never shall forget how good you were to her, some
years ago,when she wrote to tell you about going to a beautiful evening party at the beautiful
Mansion House where the great Lord Mayor lives, in a beautiful white Satin Dress, won-
dering how many partners she would have during the evening, and whether they would all
be nice ones. And how, to her deep sorrow and astonishment, she was told that the Lord
Mayor was such a very serious old gentleman of the Scotch nation that he would not allow
any dancing in the Mansion House all his long dismal year, but that instead of that delicious
darling amusement they were to have conjuring tricks and some very stout persons drest in
chalk and ginger-beer and lemonade, and how she almost cried with vexation, and was really
very glad to go home! Only fancy, dear Mr. Punch, very glad to go home! Well, as you
were so very good as to put her letter in I do hope you will put in mine.
Oh, dear Mr. Punch, I have had such a week as, I suppose, no poor little girl like me
ever had before. "We were all asked to go to the Mansion House, on Twelf Night, to a
fanoy-dress Ball! me and my two sisters, and cousin Frank. I was drest like a real fairy
and carried a magic wand, my sisters like Night and Morning, and cousin Frank like a sailor,
and beautiful we all looked, and Frank said we ought to be photographed, and he wouldn't
mind being a shilling towards it; wasn't it good of him?
Well, we set off about 6 o'clock, but it was so dreadfully slippery that the horses had to
walk all the way, and as we were (roing up a very steep hill, which Frank said in his funny
way, must be a good hill because it led to the Angel, though I don't know a bit what he
meant, one of the horses tumbled down and cut himself so badly that the Coachman said
it was impossible to go further, so the carriage was turned round and we were driven slowly
home! I need not tell you how I cried with
disappointment. But it was a misfortune,
so like a sensible child, as I hope I am, I
soon got over it and went to sleep.
But on the Friday we all went out to a
nice evening party and as it was so cold
Mamma made us all take our hats with us
to come home in, and a most beautiful party
it was. But oh, Mr. Punch, judge of our
feelings, which you cannot, as you don't
wear them, when on going to get our lovely
hats we found that the three horrid Cats
they keep in the house had seized the beau-
tiful birds, that of course we wear on them,
and were rushing about the house tearing
them all to pieces! I need not trouble you
with the scene of horror that followed, when
they were at length returned to us utterly
ruined, but I do most sincerely and affec-
tionately ask you to order that henceforth
all horrid Cats shall be muzzled. Elsie.
THE CHARTERHOUSE.
"Floreat jEternum Carthusiana Domus!"
Who'll save the grand time-honoured
place
By brick and mortar bounded,
Who with destruction would disgrace
The home that Sutton founded?
'Twas here that centuries ago
The Friars' patient order
On land on which one rose would grow,
Laid out their patient border.
The simple fee he bade them bring
Mild Monks to noble lessor,
One English Rose for England's king,
One Mass for the Confessor!
Gone are the landmarks of the School
Old London's heart delighting,
Where Richard Lovelace played the fool,
And Crashaw took to fighting!
Past with the Charterhouse away,
Wit, Soldier, and Debater—
Gone our own Leech and Thackeray,
Who loved their "Alma Mater "—
Gone Russell's, Saunder's, Elder's days—
Gone memories of Comus,
On Founders' Day: the speeches, plays—
"Carthusiana Domus.
And must the ruin fall as well
On cloister, courts, and grasses?
Will progress hush the Chapel Bell
Destroy the tombs and brasses?
May Charterhouse behold no more
In chapel dimly lighted,
The black-gowned brothers lads adore
The " Codds" that boys delighted?
Blest shades of Addison and Steele
That round the buildings hover,
The home where wits have knelt and kneel,
Destroy not, but recover!
This silent corner of the town
Green-girdled, still, oasis
The home of gentlemen in gown,
Of love and light the basis!
Here in old Hall have swelled the list,
Great names—the world should know it,
Moncrteff, the famous dramatist,
And Heraud critic-poet.
There in the evening of his days,
Dwells one who silence mellows,
Morton the Maddison of plays.
Best Box and Cox of fellows!
There rest the present, with the past,
Do not destroy—restore them.
And " Adsum" they will cry at last,
As Newcome did before them!

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday, 'January \%th.—New Parliament
met to-day. Got ud at Six o'CIock, intending to earn great prize of
being first in. To sit on door-step for few hours in bleak January
morning, nothing to me if I oan only bring honour upon Barkshire.
Making my way in the dark along piazza leading to entrance,
stumbled over a bundle. Thought it was a sack of flour. Found
it was Havelock camping out all night. Rather glad these fellows,
for there were half-a-dozen of them, were beaten, after all. Blake
got himself carried inside in a clothes-basket; and when Havelock
and the rest raoed in, they found Member for Forest of Dean in
possession.
Went down again at One o'clock. Found place full; Peter Ry-
lands doing the honours of the occasion, showing new Members over
the House, and indicating the various points of interest.
"That's where I sit," ne said to admiring circle of new Members.
'' That's Gladstone's place, and here's Lord Randolph's old corner.
Bright often oomes and sits beside me. 'Peteh,' he says, as he
edges me out of the corner seat, 'if there's one thing I do like, it's

Wednesday.—Been a terrible bout of swearingto-day. Began at
Two o'clock, continued without intermission till Half-past Five.
"Our army in Flanders was nothing to this," said Trevelian,
looking on.
A strange scene. Speaker comfortably seated in the Chair, but
that the only mark of repose in Chamber. Floor thronged. In the
centre towered the familiar face of Bradlat/gh, almost as red as on
the day when he was kicked down-stairs d la Daddy Longlegs,
because he wouldn't say his prayers. Two tables in the middle of
the floor against which Members were pitilessly crushed.
"Shall carry mark of the edge of that table till I'm no more,"
said'WiGGiN, pressing his pliable sides.
"More like the pit door of the Lyceum on a first night," said
DrxoN-HARTLAND, who knows all about theatres, their exits and
their entrances.

way. But he wants his hat, and will have it.
Don't know who we've got here now, Toby," he said, after by
searching glance satisfying himself that I at least was innocent.
"A good roomy hat, that's been knocking about the House these
last fourteen years, might prove too strong a temptation for some of
these new Members."
Came upon Bradlaugh sitting limp in Library, his massive bosom
heaving with sobs.
"What's the matter now P" I asked. "Are you weeping because
your game's up, and you are likely now to be allowed to take the
Oath without that extensive advertising which some good people
gratuitously supplied you with P"
"No, Toby, it's not that," Bradlattgh said, in voice choked with
emotion. "lam shedding a tear for dear old Gosset. The place is
not the same without him. Erskine's a good fellow, most gentlemanly
man, and a little nearer my height. But Gosset knew my step.
You may have observed when in the old times we waltzed between
the Bar and Mace, how easily we turned at the proper moment.
That was partly practice, but largely special adaptability. We
were made for each other; and the idea of taking a fresh partner at
my time of life is painful. I think I '11 quietly take the Oath, and
make an end of the business."
Speaker sworn-in in good old-fashioned style. Everybody unani-
mous, save that from time to time, whilst proposer and seconder were
speaking, there come from below the Gangway to the left a croaking
voice which cried "No!" and a harsh laugh which laughed "Ha I
ha!" New Members looking up quickly turned their eyes in the

ment as soon as he reached table, and said a swear to himself. Did
it over again when he reached the Clerk. Introduced to the Speaker
in due form, though, as Speaker said he, "thought he'd seen him
before," and bo round by back of the chair into obscurity. Here and
thus endeth what is called "the Bradlaugh incident, an incident
just five years long. Business done.—Swearing-in like anythink.
Thursday.—Letter this morning from Christopher Sykes, who, I
regret to say, is reported to be laid up with a sprained ankle:—
Dear Toby, Brantinghamthorpe, Wednesday.
I'm here laid up—ahem!—with sprained ankle. It will, I
fear, be some time before I am able to take my share in those Par-
liamentary duties which I love so well, and for which I am so
admirably fitted. The fact is, Toby (but this, of course, is between
you and me), I was at the House on Tuesday, and got such a fright
that I took the first train north, and here 1 am, still shuddering
when I think of it. Give you my word I never saw such a lot of
fellahs in my life. House of Commons was always a puzzle to me.
Sometimes 1 have sat in side galleries, and looked down upon them,
wondering what they meant, and how they could do it. The Zoo on
a Sunday not in it for exciting a fellows mind and making him
wonder. There's Gladstone, for example. Think of a man at his
age working all day, and then coming to the House to remain
through the greater part of the night, and make speeches!
I once introduced a Bill, you know—something to do with Crab
Sauce, and Oyster Salad. Don't remember at the time what became
of it. Asked Barrlngton to take charge of it in the Lords. But I

fancy there was some difficulty about it in the" Commons. I forgot
one "of the stages. Moved Third Heading before it got through Com-
mittee, or something of that kind. But I didn't care so long as I
got the dem'd thing out of my hands. Never had such a time m my
life. Used to wake up in the night to see Lobsters crawling up the
wall, and Crabs searching for my big toe. A Great Personage took
deep interest in the measure. Always inquired how it was getting
on when he met me. That encouraging and gratifying. Shows
H. R. H. keeps his eye upon publio affairs, and takes profound inte-
rest in legislative measures. But not enough to compensate me for
loss of rest, and necessity of sitting in the House of Commons an
hour at a time, watching the Bill. Crabs and Lobsters were my first
legislative care. They shall be my last.
But what I wanted to talk to you about, was these new fellahs.
Upon honour, most remarkable gathering I ever saw. One fellow in
rough tweed coat and billycock. Wanted to shake hands with me!
Thought I should have died on the spot. Looked at him with glassy
stare, and fled. Don't know that I shall turn up this Session. Eeely
couldn't stand it. If they wouldn't speak to me, would let me sit
quietly by myself in side gallery, wouldn't mind. But when a
creature in a rough tweed suit starts the wav this one did, I know
what will happen. Let me hear from you, from time to time, as to
how things are going on. If you write from the House of Commons,
Eray fumigate the paper. I '11 send you some violet pastilles if you
aven't got any. In the meantime,! send you a sketch of how the
new Members struck me. If H.R.H. asks after me, just tell him I
have had a shock. The sprained ankle is of course a flam.
Ever yours faithfully, C. Sykes.
Business done.—Still swearing.

of first hour to-day, stream of Members dammed. Only some forty
or fifty turned up, and when these were sworn-in, Speaker, after
painful pause, adjourned House till Wednesday.
The Attitude of Greece.—Of course Classical.
FIAT LUSK!
We understand that Mr. Alderman Lusk is shortly to receive a
handsome Testimonial from the hands of his innumerable friends and
admirers. It is to take the shape of his own portrait, treated, alle-
gorically. This work of Art, which will be the joint production, we
believe, of Mr. Burne-Jones and a popular caricaturist, will repre-
sent the worthy Alderman as Pluto carrying off Proserpine. The
treatment will be ingeniously adapted to emphasise the salient
traits of the Aldermanic character. Pluto, looking jocosely fierce,
with a sort of Khadamanthus-cum-Joe-Miller expression, wearing
the cap-and-bells, and armed with a pitchfork, will be shown
"coming down heavily" on Proserpine—the original Flower Girl—
who, dropping her basket of blossoms, is vainly endeavouring to
evade the grasp of the despotical civio Dis. The Alderman, in true
Music-Hall stylo, is singing a humorous impromptu of his own
composition:—
"Trespass in the civic Emm?
Won't I give you salts-and-senna!
Dis appears!—fast disappearance
Of fast girls,—a regular clearance!
There, shut up! Obey my nod!
Pay two bob, or go to quod!
Which, I need not tell such ladies,
Is the modern name for Hades!"
It will at once be seen that this racv composition is as worthy of
the Aldermanic Muse as the picture itself is subtly suggestive of the
Aldermanic modes, moods, and manners. It is hoped that the
voluntary contributions which will doubtless pour in from the
public towards the cost of this well-deserved tribute, will be some
sort of set-off to the snub administered to the worthy Alderman
by the few foolish persons who subscribed their shillings on behalf
of those brazen baggages of Flower Girls he so severely, yet
humorously, "sat upon" the other day. Such contributions may be
forwarded anywhere, by anybody who may be fool enough to send
them. Further particulars will not be announced.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE BENT BAYONET OF OLD ENGLAND.
After the Battle.
Private Thomas Atkins. " Corkscrew, Captain? Here 'g
WHO'S TO BLAME?
A Comedy, in Three Acta.
ACT. I.
SCENE — A Desert. British Force entrenched, and Sentries seen
marching up and down. Suddenly a yell is heard, and dark
Forms, brandishing spears, break into the Camp. Confusion.
Soldiers spring to arms. Terrible metee. After ten minutes'
severe fighting, Enemy driven off.

ed afterwards.
Extract from
his Letter.—" I
regret to say that
at this critical
moment the new
patent multiplex
machine - gun
failed to act, and
the Gunners, in
attempting to
hring it into ac-
tion, were killed

also unfortunate
that most of the

head, thus allowing the savages to spear our men at leisure. The
same may be said of the Infantry bayonets; and I attribute the
Sreat loss of life on our side—fifty men killed, and one hundred and
fty wounded—to these facts, and to the regrettable circumstance
that most of the cartridges had no bullets in them!"
ACT II.
Scene—House of Commons. Party Debate expected on question of
extending hour of School-Board polling from six to half-past.
Obvious impatience of Questions exhibited by crowded House.
An Hon. Member wished to know if the attention of the Sub-
Extra-Under-Secretary-for-War had been called to the statement of a
Speoial Correspondent—(howls)—as to the unserviceableness of most
of the weapons served out to our brave troops now fighting in Africa P
(" Sit down.'")
Mr. Chadband had no reason whatever to suppose that there was
a word of truth in the statement alluded to, and which had been
forwarded by a mere Civilian Correspondent. (Cheers.) It was
obvious that the officials of the War Office were in a better position
to know whether bayonets had broken and guns jammed than a
mere irresponsible scribbler, whose only claim to be heard on the
subject was, that he had actually witnessed the events of which ho
wrote. (Hear.' hear.') Probably his exaggerated statements were
due to panic—(laughter)—owing to the proximity of the enemy.
Fortunately Members of that House were able to exercise a calmer
judgment; and he felt bound to tell them that the whole story was
a concoction. (Cheers.)
ACT III.
Scene—Aldershot, three months later. Owing to the return of the
Troops, confirming in every particular the Correspondent's
reports, and the pressure of the Press, the Government have at
last reluctantly consented to have all weapons tested.
First Private Soldier. Hah! There goes another! (Sword snaps
under the test.) Why, that makes twenty out of fifty, don't it P
Second Ditto (fiercely). Wish those blanked idiots who give us
such weapons had to use 'em against a lot of howling Arabs, that's
all!
Third Ditto. Ah, it's a crying shame! Yet, I suppose those who
supplied and proved this rubbish—(pointing to heap of broken swords
and bayonets)—will be able to hush it all up. Bless you, they won't
be punished. They ordered a lot of our poor fellows to execution,
all the same. Well, it's a rum world! [Left pondering,

La Doctorcsse, and her Husband begging
her pardon—An 'Ealer and a Knecler.
A WORD FOR THE FRENCH ROYALISTS.
TnE Royalists I mean, are the members of the French Company at
the Royalty Theatre. M. Mayer changes his bill so rapidly, that,
to the most successful of the pieces played here sufficient time is not
allowed for what in London is now under-
stood as "a run." He does not permit them
to run, he makes them gallop, and no sooner
are they started than they are off—here to-day
and gone to-morrow—and are no more seen
untO they aro reproduced, perhaps, in some of
our theatres as adaptations from the French.
Adaptable as La Doctoresse undoubtedly is,
it must be seen at its best on the French stage,
and I strongly advise all, who like pood French
light comedy-acting, to see M. Xohi.et and
Mile. Magnier as Frontignan
and Anqele in La Doctoresse,
by MM. Ferrier and Bocage,
before M. Mayer removes it,
as he infallibly will, unless the
public insists on his keeping
it in the bills for at least a
month to come. The piece com-
mences at a quarter to eight—
or professes to begin at that
hour,-—though wnen I was
there it was, I am glad to say,
a good ten minutes behind
time, thus enabling our appre-
ciative party to see it from the
rise of the curtain even to the
fall thereof on the end of the
Third Act,—and it is over at
eleven: during which time
you will get as many hearty
laughs as are good for you in one evening. It is perfectly played. I
am not saying that I consider the Palais Royal method of taking an
audience into the Low Comedian's confidence as the perfection of his-
trionic Art,—no, I do not mean that,—it never will and never can be,
except when such confidential asides are intentionally written to suit
the manner of an Actor, as they were for the inimitable Charles
Mathews (Heavens! how he has made tears of laughter course down
my cheeks!); but, accepting this peculiarity as part of the game, then
the acting of the principal parts in La Doctoresse is as good as any-
one would wish it to be, whether here or in its own native land. The
first t wo Acts go with roars of laughter, due to the dialogue, the Actors,
and the situations. The Second Act, in which the climax is reached,
is very funny; but the third is comparatively weak, though the moral,
which I will not anticipate by quotation,—except to say, that the cur-
tain is " rung down" by la sonnette de nuit,—is, to my mind, worth
the whole Act.
For an invalid troubled in liver a fee to La Doctoresse is 'money
well laid out. Her motto is "Down with the dumps!" The plot
belongs to the old family group of Un Mari d la Campagne.
There is, to quote Messrs. Paulton and Bhough,
"Not too much plot, but just plot enough."
1 Woa, Pegasus! I mustn't drop into poetry. Let the theatre-going
public, and specially that portion of it which enjoys the Criterion
pieces, and the bustling touch-and-go Mr. Charles Wyndham, lose
not a moment, but go and see La Doctoresse. And if they don't
thank me afterwards for my recommendation, and, if there be any
gratitude in them, give me a handsome testimonial, my name is not
their humble and devoted servant, Broad Nlubs.
P.S.—By the way, I must mention a performance of an amateur
burlesque, by military amateurs, at Chelsea Barracks.who evidently
will never be Chelsea pun-shunners. There was a go and a hearti-
ness about the playing which would have made the success of a
worse piece than this. The singing and dancing were of excellent
quality: the stage-business and the topical hits most amusing, and
the scenery and costumes highly effective. The style of the burlesque
was of that sort of variety entertainment form which was intro-
duced long ago here when Miss Lydia Thompson played in Blu»
Beard with Messrs. Brocgh and Edoutn, and which the two latter
have recently done their best with The Babes, to perpetuate. There
were no Vivandieres playing, the Actors being all on the "spear
side," and none on the spindle.
What does Bismarck's " Schnapps Monopoly Bill" mean? Has he
taken to steady drinking, and wants to have all the Schnapps to
himself? Such a jolly dog must be muzzled, and that will»interfere
with his Sohnapping,

A REAL GOOD SHOW.
Mr Dear Regent Morton and Eael of Leicester Square,—I am
aware that you are the "Acting Manager" at the Alhambra, and not
the Dancing Manager, but as the two Arts are so admirably combined
at this establishment, I may
address you as the Represen-
tative of both, and congratu-
late you on having the best en-
tertainment that your Theatre
of Varieties has produced for
years, and the largest audiences
to witness it. ^ou have got
a charming ballet, Nina, at
Nine - a - clock, arranged and
i invented by Mons. J. Hansen.
The principal danseuse, Mile.
Pallabino (my compliments to
her), as the heroine, tells her
story in pantomime so perfectly
that no Acting Manager, how-
ever well ho might act, could
do it better; and she makes all
her points, with her toes, so in-
telligibly that the audience can
follow her closely with their

Piping Times at the Alhambra,
understandings, and become as deeply interested in the plot as if they
were seeing a melodrama. She is ably supported by Miles. Li llie Lee
and Marie as Manuelito and Juanez. The music, by your excellent
Music Manager, M. Jacobi, characteristically illustrates the different
situations, and gives the motives for action. It is as catching as
measles, and as dramatic as Meyerbeer's Huguenots.
By the way, why should not the story of some well-known Opera
be condensed and arranged as a Ballet? Or, if we come to that,

Nin a a Nine-a-'Clocx.
Mile. Palladino and the Bullet of the Iu-faiin'd Allphan Asylum.
why not Hamlet? "To be or not to be" would perhaps present
some little difficulty as a pas scul; but "the Two Macs" would
make a first-rate pair of Grave-diggers,—with a fight introduced, of
course. They are wonderful fellows. I remember them two or three
years ago. They are now funnier than ever
With the single exception of the Blondin
Donkey, I haven't seen anything so su-
premely idiotically ridiculous as the per-
formance of the Two Macs. Their tableaux
are like a series of
those eomio Ger-
man pictures.

way of suddenly turning nasty, looking quite assid, and threatening to
"go for " his master, is perhaps one of the most original bits of jocose
iack-assity ever seen on the stage within the memory of the oldest
living playgoer, or music-hall habitue".


Alii
The Blondin Donkey; or,
The Vigour of Bray.
Once more I must'congratulato"you,'Regent.MoRTON and Earl of
Leicester Square, on your Military ^Ballet, which finishes the evening
triumphantly. Victory crowns the efforts of the"Alhambra Company.
The costumes are from designs by M. Besche,—qui faeit per
"Alias" facit per se,—that is, they arc made by M. Alias, and
are quite per se,"—especially, of course, those worn by the sailors.
Musical Manager Jacobi's music brings in all the national airs, and
the Highlanders, Lowlanders, Grannydears, and Little-dears, bring
in with them all their national graces. By the way, in the " Bayonet
Charge," the bayonets seemed to be in good order. Hadn't you
better, my excellent Regent Morton, immediately order an inspec-
tion? This is only a suggestion from Steel Nibbs.
A FEW MORE OF THEM.
Sin John Lubbock's list of the "Hundred Best Books," though it
has given general satisfaction to every one except Mr. Ruskin, has
been subjected, in certain influential quarters, to some amendment,
and the following few specimens, taken at random, may interest
those who are eager to provide still more suitable material for the
readers of the Working Men's College :—
Lord Randolph Churchill.—Blue Books on Burmah (various).
A Young Three Volume Novelist.—A hundred volumes of his
latest work (uncut).
•Book on the coming Derby, illus

Song
■I Member of the Jockey Club.-

Mr. Augustus Harris.—Ledger, handsomely bound
velvet, showing recent booking at Drury Lane Theatre.
Mr. Pamell.—" History of his Negotiations with the Present Gov-
ernment," furnished in his own Black Books.
King Milan of Servia.—"Handy Volume of Patriotic Poems,"
improvised on the conclusion of the recent campaign.
Mr. Wills.—" The Life and Times of Mr. Schutz Wilson," as
gathered from his criticism on Faust.
Mr. W. H. Smith— Pocket Edition of "Irish Nationalist

Mr. Wilson Barrett.—Book of "The Lord Harry," showing Mr.
Wilson Barrett's share of the composition printed in red ink.
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach.—" The Comic History of Procedure in

Sir Drummond Woolff.—" An Account of Turkish Backgammon"
(with Illustrations), as played by him daily at Cairo with Moukhtar
Pasha.
Prince Henry of Battenberg.—" Some of his Movements," as gath-
ered from the Court Circular, printed on white satin (edition de luxe).
The Speaker of the House of Commons.—Volume of his own
"Commentaries."
Sir Edward Wathin.—" The Greatest Bores of History," with
some account of the floating of the Channel Tunnel Company.
Mr. Horsley,R.A.—" Clothes, and How to Wear Them," Beinga
handsomely illustrated pamphlet of a well-known firm of Advertising
Tailors.
The Butcher.—" His Book Made Dp to Date," with request for a
cheque.
Decrepitude at A Premium.—"Nothing like old servants!"
everyone says. Old servants are supposed to be as valuable as Old
Masters, old fiddles, and old friends. Old servants are becoming scarce.
This is very strange, as people are getting older and older every
day. They are even advertising for the aged retainer. Look at
this, from the Morning Post:—
T\7'ANTED, immediately, a Good PLAIN COOK ; no dairy or baking;
V V Church of England; age about 80; good wages.
We can understand a fine old crusted Butler giving dignity to a
Family Mansion. But a good Plain Cook of eighty puzzles us. Her
mission is rather to be useful than ornamental; her influence is felt
rather than seen. We should think "A good Plain Cook of eighty"
could make her influence very much felt indeed, and would probably
manage to entirely upset a large family in the course of a couple of
days.
The Children's Knight.
"Sic transit gloria Mundella!"

'Gainst fierce over-pressure and hard-hearted men;

life is quite worth living. Thought the Jubilee Year would be a nice

In a poverty-stricken Irish fishing village, to expend some £4,000
on a solid stone pier, which a fishing-boat nas never been laid along-
side of, and which is as dangerous as a rock to a poor canoe-man
venturing to approach it, would seem to be as ripe a specimen of
official folly as the Circumlocution Office itself could well excogitate.
Yet this, according to the Daily Chronicle's Special Commissioner,
is what has been done at the now famine-stricken village of Tully,
on the West Coast of Ireland. This is the sort of thing, it seems,
which is, humorously, called a "Relief Work," and not the only
instance the Commissioner has seen of such works, " which have
proved absolutely useless to the fishermen in whose interests they
were made." This pier might pair off with the celebrated
Windows that exclude the light,
And passages that lead to nothing.
for it is not properly connected with the village, and nobody ever uses
it.' How grateful the famishing fishermen must be for Tully'8

waited upon Lord Salisbury, to demonstrate strongly in favour of
"things as they are," in happy Ireland!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[January 30, 1886.
"Do you suspect my bag ?" I cried, indignantly; "for, if youdo,
I '11 open it and show you what it contains-.
"Don't be a fool!" said he, in a hurried whisper. "All our men
are spread about, and if the roughs saw you and me having a dis-
turbance over a black bag we might both get badly hurt—you be-
cause they didn't know you, and me because they cud. So, to moke
things quite safe, put your hands together and there you are."
With this, to my great surprise, he cleverly clutched hold of both
wrists of my coat and effectually handcuffed me. Again my nose
put itself painfully in evidence, and my numbed fingers, which suffered
terribly from the cold, began to relax their hold. I informed my
captor that I could retain the bag no longer, when he told me that if
I dropped it " it would be the worse for me."
It was in this painful and humiliating position that I saw my Most
Gracious Sovereign pass me. I raised a feeble cheer, but was not
allowed to lift my hatt as my loyalty suggested would have been
appropriate to the occasion. I can only hope that if Her Majesty
recognised one of her most devoted servants covered in her presence,
she will not attribute it to any feeling of disrespect, or any legal
claim to wear my hat in the presence of my King, which, I am well
aware, is the sole privilege of one of her nobles. Immediately the
Royal Procession had passed, and the lines of spectators were broken,
I turned indignantly to my captor, and demanded an explanation.
The man, on finding from my card who I was, was profuse in his
apologies, but excused himself on the score that "he was quite sure
that none of his people had ever seen me at the Sessions, the Bailey,
or the Royal Courts.
Angrily throwing myself into a hansom, I drove at a furious rate
to Mr. Justice Chttson's Chambers, where I found "one of Shrimp's
people" quietly lounging in the corridor.
Here they are!" I cried, excitedly, thrusting the precious docu-
ments, which I had drawn from my brief-bag, into his hands. "I
hope I am not too late!"
Shrimp's Representative looked at me calmly, and then, seeming
to recollect something, observed, "Ah, to be sure! I forgot! Yea,
of course, to-day we were to decide whether the beneficiaries were
entitled to fifteen thousand pounds under the will, or only fivepence.
Well, some of the other people forgot the appointment, so the Chief
Clerk has adjourned the matter until we are ready, which will be, I
suppose, in about three months!"
From which it will be seen that the proceedings in Shrimp v.
Lambkin are not to be oarried on too hastily!
A. Briefless, Junior.
PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
MY BRIEF-BAG GETS ME INTO TROUBLE.
When I have nothing better to do from a legal point of view, I
take a hand in the suit of Shrimp v. Lambkin. My connection
with the matter is purely en amateur, as, being an interested party, of
course, I cannot be briefed. Shrimp v. Lambkin is being tried in
the Chanoery Division of the High Court. It is rather a complicated
affair, having six or seven sets of Solicitors, and as many Plaintiffs
and Defendants. It is somewhat difficult to find out among the latter
which is whioh, as the Plaintiff of to-day frequently becomes the
Defendant of to-morrow, while the Defendant of yesterday often
blossoms into the Plaintiff of next week. It is scarcely necessary to
say after this that Shrimp v. Lambkin is a family dispute.
On entering my Chambers, a few days since, Portlngton met
me with the usual announcement "that Shrimp v. Lambkin was
again in the paper."
"Shrimp's people dropped in, Sir," continued my right-hand man,
"to say that if you had nothing better to do, you might take the
lease and affidavits in the newspaper good-will matter down to Mr.
Justice Chitson's Chambers, as they have a most important appoint-
ment at 2 to-day—in fact, a matter of vital importance—and can't
get on without them. They say you have all the documents, and
that there are no copies."
"Is my bag here?" I asked Portlngton.
"No, Sir," replied my excellent and admirable Clerk, "you will
remember that you last used it to carry home the pheasants Mr. Thorn-
ton sent you, which arrived at the same time with that grocery
packet from the Stores."
Spurred on to exertion by the feeling that much depended on my
promptitude, I hastened to Burmah Gardens, filled my black bag
with the necessary documents, and commenced my return to the
Strand. I determined, as I had now plenty of time, to walk across the
Park, and had got as far as the Horse Guards' Parade when, to my
surprise, I discovered a throng of people and several batteries of
artillery. Suddenly it occurred to me that it was the occasion of the
Queen's Opening of Parliament, and that the crowd before me was
waiting the arrival of Her Majesty. I looked at the Horse Guards'
Clock—it was twenty minutes past one. If I could not get across at
once, I was, so far as Shrimp v. Lambkin was concerned, a lost man.
In vain attempts to escape, I found myself at last confined in a
mob of people awaiting the procession, and unable to move either
forward or backward. Iwas a close prisoner, and could not stir. It was

Thursday, Jan. 21.—" Qucen'a weather!"—" Oh, what a day we're having!"
at this moment that I suddenly became conscious of the presence of my
black bag, which had already attracted considerable hostile attention.
I smiled as innocently as I could: hut, to judge from the expression
on the faces around me, evidently my forced geniality created an
unfavourable impression. I would have given worlds at this
moment to have got rid of my black hag, even with its precious
freight of leases and affidavits, as I felt that it was seriously en-
dangering my safety. All the stories of the dynamite outrages, in-
variably associated with a black bag, came back to me, and at this
supreme moment of my existence my nose was seized with a fit of
irritability whioh I felt could only be cured by gentle friction. I did
not dare to raise my arms, for fear of creating suspicion. In one
hand I had an umbrella and handkerchief, in the other my black
bag, which became heavier and heavier in my numbed half-
frozen fingers. It was at this moment that a man in a pot
hat, who looked like a cross between a very country butler ana a
a very town-bred gamekeeper, approached me, and stood beside me.
In an instant some of my rougher companions slunk away.
"Now," said the new-comer, in an undertone to me, "we don't
want no disturbance. We've 'ad our eye upon you since you've
been here—and we intend to keep an eye on you till you step it."
I indignantly protested against this uncalled-for interference, and
asked him what he meant.
"Never you mind what I mean, hut just keep your hands where
they are, for if you attempt to move them it will be the worse for
you."
NEW PROPOSED RULES OF PROCEDURE.
(By the Wife of an Old Member.)

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER.
lira, as our great Na-
shional Poet hob-
serves, "Whene'er I
takes my warks
abroad what funny
things I sees!"
No. 1.—I seed a
hole row of aperiently
sane people, includin
one. woman and a
pore I [diluted little
boy, a standing at
the Picretick, Slime
Shop in Obun, drink-
ing their glasses all
round, same is at a
respectabel Pub, ex-
eep that they all
looked jolly sollem
insted of awful jolly.
I at wunce confesses
to having a certain
amount of curiossity
in my manly natur,
most enquiring minds
must have, but I
never had the small-
est wish to wark into
that sillybrated
drinking Bar and call
for a glass of their
famous mixture, hav-
ing the bad taste to
Erefer a nice glass of
ot Rum and water.
I (No. 2.—I seed a red flag a fluttring intheBreesat aWarehus
door in the Citty. On enkwyring of a most respecktabel porter who
was a standing there, what it meant, he said it meant danger, as I
shood see if I looked up. I looked up accordingly, and seed a huge
mass of goods a swinging playfully in the hair, hanging aperiently
by a bit of string jest hover my pore ed like sumboddy's sword in
the fabel. Need I say as I took to my eels like a race horse, thank-
ing my lucky stars that my lordable curiosity had not corst me my
walabel life.
No. 3.—Te a Ciioffi !—Well, I have in the course of my long life
seen many instances of bad spellin. Even I myself, I'm told, to
my grate surprise, am sumtimes gilty of slite errors in that direc-
tion, but never, no never have I seed sitch a spessimen as I seed, in
Chancery Lane too, of all plaices in the world, ony last week. It was
at a Corffee Shop, and in the winder was printed in wery large
letters, "Te a Choffi!" meaning Tea and Corfee! Was ever sitch
hignorance seen, andin sitch a Learned Lane? Ah! it's the old story,
the nearer to Chancery the further from good spellin. This reminds
me of a funny thing as occurd last summer, witch I shall call—
No. 4.—A gent .'came into our Corfee Room, and said to me some-
think as sounded like "Polly vu Francis?" Of course, I was
emused at his calling me Francis, but feeling sure as he was a
frenchman I ansered at wunce "no Mounseer." So he took a pencil
and peace of paper and wrote down "The" and showed it to me, so
of course I said no understandy." Fortunately there was a cup
and saucer on the table, so he took it up and pretended to drink out
of it, then of course I knowed cxakly what he wanted, and gave him
a werry nice cup of tea, and then he nodded his head, and so I gave
him another cup, and then he gave me a shilling, and then went
away and wouldn't take his fourpence change! leaving me quite
unabel to decide witch to wunder at most, his gross hignorance in
spellin, or his extreme ginerosity. My experience leads me to think
that hignorance is one of the fruteful mothers of ginerosity.
No. 5.—I was a warking qwietly home the other nite, and as I past
round one of the nice Squares near the Fondling, I had a good long
look up at the stars, ana I was jest a thinking of all the wunderfool
amoosin storys as I had once herd a reverend Deen tell us at a Lecter
at Greeshun Collidge, such as that it wood take a dubble Flying
Skotch Express Trane about twelve million years to get to one of the
werry neerest on 'em—and how sollem he looked all the wile as if he
reely expected us to bleeve it—wen a lady run up to me out of a house
as I was a passing, and she says, says she, "Pleese, Sur, will you be
so kind as to cum and kill a Beadle P" I natrally started withnorrer
wen she hadded, "It's ony a black'un, it's on the stares, and neither
me nor my Sister can go past it." So I went in and did the deed, and
they thankt me and guv me a shillingl and a glass of werry good sherry
jest to set me up again after performing the fearful crush. I may be
allowed to express a hope that he is not the last of his race in that
partickler manshun of female dellicassy,
BY AN ENTHUSIAST.
VMns. Arthur Aunold has issued a counterblast to tobacco, cramming
her canister with a surfeit of charges before firing it at the pernicious weed."—
St. James's Gazette.
Not for all a woman's sneers
"•At the joys she does not know,
Will I yield thee, friend of years,
And Nicotian charms forego.
Best of many boons to man,
Mister Punch for thee will
plead;
Hail to RALT.ion! who began—
With the Weed.
Brave Tobacco, since we knew
All the joys that thou canst give,
We ."have wondered, men . who
blew
Ne'er a cloud to heaven/could
live.
Plaything in an idle hour,
Comfort in our sorest need,
Let us rather call thee flower,
Not a Weed.
Happy nights I've spent with
thee,
0 my venerable pipe,
Born like Venus in the sea,
Walnut-tinted, old and ripe.
Cares evanish with the smoke,
By each; pensive breathing
freed;
Adding zest to kindly joke,
Fragrant Weed.
Wine works wonders, we are told.
Fills a man with power and
pride,
Rolls a flood of liquid gold,
Or a purple-tinted tide.
Yet it brings the hasty word.
And the inconsiderate deed;
Ne'er are evil passions stirred
By the Weed.
Thou canst add a charm to books,
Speed the hours on swifter
wings,
Kinder seem a friend's kind looks
Through Tobacco's airy rings.
Summer days are fairer tar,
Winter's gloom we never heed,
Soothed by pipe or by cigar,
With the Weed.
Woman wot we well hath charms,
But she too can use us ill;
She may blush within our arms.
But her glance hath power to
lull.
Thou art ever-faithful found.
Fairest flower that springs from
seed,
Mightiest herb that grows on
ground,
Blessea Weed!

"Ou sont U» neiges a"antan?" asked Villon. Where are the
snows of yester-weck? we may ask of Bumble. Still weighting our
ways and cumbering our street-corners, is the answer. A fat woman
in front of an avalanche were not more stupidly helpless than Bumble
in face of a four-inch fall of snow. Only the avalanche would sweep
the adipose Mrs. Partington away, whereas Bumble's motto is fy
suis, fy reste. •
Those all too familiar Augurs, who could not look at each other.
without laughing, have been trotted out again lately ad nauseam. I*
they could meet now, they would not be able to look at each other
without weeping—at the thought of the public nuisance they have
become. Surely now they should be spelt augers, for they are great
bores.

THE RECENT ATTITUDE
OF GREASE.
No. 1, ADELPHI TERRISS.
Mr. Terriss wrote to the Daily News
last Thursday about "First-Nighters."
He said, "I should like to put on record
my entire dissent from the abuse which
has been heaped on 'First-Nighters.'"
Also "It is all very to claim the in-
dulgence due to 'Ladies and Gentle-
men,' but Artists should remember that
they are Actors and Actresses when
they are on the boards"—("Hear.'
hear!" from Us)—"and if tney wish
to be treated as Ladies and Gentlemen
only, they had better remain in that
privacy with which the Public will not
interfere, and where they will be free
alike from public applause or public
censure." How many of your profes-
sion share your opinions? And now we
have got a fine chance for our one jeu de
mot on your name, which is that we find
a Sara Avis in Terriss.

A "PHENOMENA."
A Correspondent sends us this extract from the Advertisement,
in the Guardian:—
HOUSEMAID and CHOIR HELP. Rare offer ; valuable servant;
experienced managing housemaid; thoroughly trusty; respectable;
plays efficiently harmonium, full choral service in country church. Twenty-
four. Eight years' character. Address the Vicar,—specifying work required,
number in family, servants kept, wages offered.
"Rare offer!" rather. A first-rate Housemaid, who can play the
Harmonium, and give a full choral service, is indeed a treasure.
Only twenty-four, with eight years' good character; so, according to
Cocker and Colenso, she must have begun this sort of thing at six-
teen. Wherever she goes she has a great future before her. House-
keeper and Precentress, and perhaps she may become a Mrs.
Proudie.
Messrs. George Routledge and Sons announce a new Volume,
entitled Men of the Meign. Is it an advertisement for Mr. Sangster r
MAKING SURE OF IT.
The Government having decreed that Mr. W. H. Smith shall first
make inquiries before reporting to them on the condition of Ireland,
it may be asked—
Whether he will be permitted to have access to the official records
kept at Dublin Castle, for the last six months;
Or have to seek now evidence of the state of affairs on his own
account;
If the latter, whether ho will cut off his hair and disguise himself
as an Irish-American, for the purpose of joining the National League;
Whether, if he succeed in doing this, he will sing " The Wear-
ing of the Green," and personally assist in extensive boycotting
operations;
Or be present and witness the maiming and wounding of loyalist
cattle;
Or whether he will endeavour to view matters entirely from the
other side, and, acting himself as bailiff, sorve a quantity of writs on
tenants marked out for eviction;
And if he does this, whether he will put up somewhere in the
immediate neighbourhood, and quietly wait to see what comes of it.
And if he is attacked by a " Moonlight" gang in consequence, and
has a narrow escape with his life, whether he thinks he will have
carried his inquiry far enough to enable him to send in his report to
the Government.
In the course of an article on.Books, entitled " Sibylline
in the Daily News, the writer, reviewing The Yeomen of the Guard,
by Mr. TnoMAS Preston, describes it as "just the book for a
pleasant idle half-hour;'' and then he adds,'' Would there were more
of them!" Did he mean "more of idle and pleasant half-hours,,
or " more of Mr. Preston's books," or "more of such books" as is
this one of Mr. Preston's? H our first interpretation of the Sybil-
line moaning is correct, we agree with him heartily. As to the
others, we may agree with him when we have read The Yeomen of
the Guard.

11 Mr. Bradlaugh's manner of taking the oath " says the Reading
Observer—(capital name this, an Observer intended for Reading; only,
in this instance, where was "the Reader " ?)—" was somewhat note-
worthy. It was a considerable time before he was able to struggle up
among the crush of Members towards the table, where the Clerk
(Mr. Milman) was swearing at each Member, singly and severally,
as he presented himself." Anxious as the Junior Member for North-
ampton was to swear himself, this hearty conduct on the part of the
Clerk, meeting him, as it were, more than half-way, must have taken
him fairly off his legs; for though, no doubt, Mr. Bradlattgh must
have been conscious or the fact that he is frequently sworn at behind
his back, he must have experienced some sense of novelty in viewing
the process thus freely and openly indulged in to his very face.

AN ENTERPRISING INTERVIEWER.
(Vide
"—St. James's
An Interviewer and his Calling.
Gazette, Jan 21.)
When I became a journalist, I never, never dreamt
My avocation would be greeted with supreme contempt.
Youaskme—am I well received? I say, with grief iafinmt,
Receptions of a tax-collector really are not m it.
For, first of all, the tax-collector doesn't care a dram;
Besides, he's very seldom kicked—I very often am.
I chose a certain line of work, considering it newer,
And soon became a very Enterprising Interviewer.
At first I oouldn't get an interview, there's not a doubt.
The footman always said, "My Lord is sorry.but he's out."
The observations out "and not at home do not offend,
They frequently ore used towards one's very dearest friend.
Ere long I found they had a special reference to me,
But / am not the sort of man to take it placidly.
I'm not a poor relation, nor objectionable wooer,
So swore they should receive this Enterprising Interviewer.
In Downing Street I knock—then take the footman un-
awares
By rushing post him in the hall, then nimbly up the stairs.
It's true I see the Peemikr in a way perhaps unlawful.
It's true the Premier's language at the interview is awful.
Rut still it is an interview, and so he '11 shortly find.
Then quickly down the stairs I go—assisted from behind.
1've wished the stairs were not so far between, and wished
them fewer,
For as they are they hurt the Enterprising Interviewer.
But in a hurried interview like this you can't expect
The article that follows to be perfectly correct.
Or if a servant says, "Why don't you ring the kitchen
bell?"
How can you, with consistency, regard the mistress well f
In such a case—I say, I know the lady wears a wig!
The article's a great success,—the circulation big.
Her husband at the office calls to catch me a one—two-er.
But doesn't always find the "Enterprising Interviewer.
I've dashed upon a Bishop who was ill in bed with gont;
My only painless interview—he couldn't kick me out.
I've forced my way on Princes, Dukes, and Statesmen of
renown,
And if theymadeunkindremarks, Ialways put them down.
Against my will I interviewed a Judge, who, with a smile,
Did most unjustly stop my avocation for awhile.
Because I soughtHERMAJESTY, andsimply said I knew 'er,
For months you will not see this Enterprising Interviewer.
A STRANGE EXPERIENCE.
(From my Uncommonplacc Book.)
A Fbiend meets me in the street. It is the day before the
opening of Parliament. His face is careworn and anxious; there
is an air of impenetrable mystery about him. He beckons me
away from the main thoroughfare, down into a side-street. Why
this? Willi come with him r My curiosity is aroused—I will. We
enter a doorway. We ascend a narrow, ill-lit staircase. Becoming
accustomed to the semi-obscurity, I am aware of mysterious forms,
wrapped and muffled, preceding and following us. Escape is im-
possible. My friend has a rapid communication with some invisible
person in, apparently, a hole in the wall. There is a brief inter-
change of pass-words. A hand appears, then disappears. My friend
moves on, and beckons me to follow. I do so. Suddenly we find
ourselves in a large room, fairly lighted. Persons, seated, are
arranged in four sides of a square. There are a few women among
them—very few—and aU are in sombre clothing. There 'is some
whispered conversation going on in different parts of the room, but
the atmosphere is laden with a senso of mute, dogged conspiracy.
Dynamiters? Secret Head-Centres? If so, why ami here? There
is a huge black board against the .wall opposite the door, on which
have been chalked, or somehow marked, ghastly white figures,
ranging from 10 to 5000. What does this mean? Who are the
doomed ones? How many? Are 5,000 to be victims at one fell
swoop? To-morrow it again occurs to me is the opening of Parlia-
ment, and I cannot bear to think of it. My friend is
speaking to another conspirator. I turn towards the door. Where
was it we came in? It is not too late. I will retreat silently, un-
observed, precipitately. I take two steps .... but the impatient
shuffling of a hundred feet, and murmurs of "Sit down!" warn me
that to attempt flight now would be fatal. My friend pulls me down
on to a chair. Time's up!" I hear exclaimed. In another
second .... full light is turned on, and for the first time I perceive
a board of green cloth in the centre of the room. Ha! am I in a
secret Inferno? Will the Police descend on us, and shall I be up
before Mr. D'Eyncoubt P The room swims round, my head
whizzles .... I close my eyes .... Oh, for one minute with a
smelling-bottle .... or even strong snuff! . . . . "Courage!"
I say to myself—" a man can die but once, and I will sell my life
dearly." I rouse myself. I hear a click. Of a pistol? .... No
it is a cannon! Roberts has just commenced, and
Cook is waiting for his turn—12,000 up, Roberts giving Cook 2,000
to start with. Happy Thought.—I wish I had two thousand to start
with. Wouldn't I start! Wouldn't I have a holiday! Rather!
The following advertisement from the Bonner Zeitung ought to
meet with some response:—
TWO GERMAN PHYSICIANS seek a learned Englishman by birth
•who teaches the elements of his Language, Grammar, and Conversation.
We have heard of born Legislators, and can only conclude that
these two German Physicians imagine that the country which produces
them will also be found equal to the supply of a born sarant. Not,
however, that the requirements of the ''Englishman learned by
birth" are of a very stringent order, seeing that they are comprised
in his ability to teach " the elements of his language, grammar, and
conversation." Given his command of the former, his claim to the
latter could be proved practicaUy enough. Any applicant for the
Eost who can satisfy the advertising Physicians in an interview that
e is learned by birth, ought certainly to be possessed of conversa-
tional powers of a hign order.

on floor of House, arrayed in dingy scarlet robes, everyone misfits, they
looked like a body of supers waiting to be called on in Coroner's jury
scene, or some equally lively entertainment. The Peeresses and their
female relations nad stormed the place, driven the Lords of theCreation
into these pens in the centre of the floor, where they sat in meek
silence, whilst incessant chattering filled the House with the sound
of sweet feminine voices. But the Ladies—God bless 'cm !—were
having such a day of it, en-
joying themselves so tho-
roughly, and looking so
charming that the Peers
were of no consequence.
H.K.H. wore his ownPeer's
robes, and showed they really
did not look so bad when
made to measure. The worst
of the Peers is, as Dtoraven
says, that in the present de-
pressed state of agriculture
and in the impossibility of
getting their rents, they
ave to save a penny wher-
ever they can. Accordingly,
they go to ready-made shops
for their robes, and are bound
to take the nearest fit that
turns up.
In House of Commons
another moving scene, but
of different kind. No red
cloaks here, nor bared shoul-
ders, nor flashing jewels—
unless we count Josepii
Gillis as one. House did not meet for business till four, but at
noon the Irish Contingent came down and took possession of all the
seats below the Gangway, making a selection of the more favoured
places above it. English and Scotch Members arriving some hours
later found themselves evicted from their old seats, bound to take
up their places in the side-galleries. From the Peers' Gallery,
Joseph, Viscount Abch, sat side by side with George, Marquis
of Howell, the two noble Lords regarding with supercilious air

the struggling crowd beneath. New Members in great force; had
recovered their breath after the rush to the Lords to hear Queen's
Speech read, and now employed it to give notice of innumerable
motions. Then they were constantly popping up in unexpected
places and attempting to address the Speaker from forbidden quarters.
Quieter opened tho Ball by quite a curious progress. Was standing
amid the throng at the Bar wlien his name was called.
"Sir," he said, " I beg to give notice"
Got no further before he was set upon by old Members, and
severely hustled. Quieter naturally indignant. If this was the
famous courtesy of the House of Commons to new Members, ho'd
take a little less of it. Hit
out valiantly in response,
but numbers overpowered
him. Hustled to the Cross
Benches, where he began
again. "Sir, I beg"
Assault recommenced.
Quieter entrenched him-
self in the corner before tho
Cross Benches, where, to
his surprise, ho was allowed,
without further interrup-
tion, to complete his notice.
Turned out he intends to
bring in Bill for Better Se-
curity of Beer.
House roared with laugh-
ter for five minutes. Quil-
ter looking about him in
amazement.
"Thought he was the
Accountant fellow," said
CHAPLIN, regarding him
through his eye-glass; "but
suppose he's in the cork line.

A mistake all round. I Old Members wished to inform new one that
he could not speak except from within the line marked by the Cross
Benches, whilst Quieter had intended to give notice of a Bill "for
the Better Security of the Purity of Beer." In the excitement of the
moment purity had deserted him.
Several new Members made maiden speeches on the Address, to
Mr. Beresfohd Hope's great discontent. "In my time," he growled,
"it was thought an impudence for a new Member to open his mouth

in the first Session. Now they make their maiden speech on the
Address, and one actually proposes to move an Amendment, which
amounts to a vote of Want of Confidence! I think I shall follow
Newdegate. Can't stand much of this."
Business done.—Address moved.
Friday.—House again crowded in floor and galleries. Sexton re-
sumed Debate on Address in speech less wind-baggish and therefore
better than usual. He was only an hour and a half at it, which for
him is what an ordinary remark is to average man. Always admitted
that Sexton is a good, even an eloquent speaker. What I have
mourned over has been his funereal tendency to smother his speech
amid dust-heaps of verbiage.
New Member still to the fore, a source of increasing marvel. One
of his favourite dissipations is to stroll between the Speaker in the
Chair and the Member on his legs, a deadly breach of Parliamentary
etiquette. To-night Joseph, Viscount Arch, having descended from
the Peers' Gallery, thought he'd stretch his legs and make a little
tour of the House. En route came between Sexton and Speaker.
A roar of execration went up from the crowded benches. His Lord-
ship paused, and instinctively turned up his coat-sleeves. If this
was the mob howling at aristocracy the sooner matters were brought
to an issue the better. Taking a step on to the floor of the House,
and gazing round defiantly, his Lordship mutely invited the mob to
"Come on!" An attempt made to drag him down upon the Front
Opposition Bench. But he is a heavy man to move, and, dis-
entangling himself from the grasp of the assailant, retreated in good
order, repeating his original offence of passing between Sexton and
the Chair, and so safely reaching the Bar, stood shoulder te shoulder
with his feUow peer, George, Marquis of Howell, ready for any
emergencies.
Later in debate another anonymous Member (half the House is
anonymous just now) performed a similar feat. The Sage of Queen
Anne's Gate was on his legs, speaking disrespectfully of the Duke
of Westminster. The New Member strolled down the House with
light heart, and passed right under the Sage's nose. The roar that
went up literally prostrated him. He lay flat on the Gangway,
looking up at the Sage, who, with hands on hips, regarded him with
a ^prolonged and cutting stare. It was piteous to see the abject
agony of the New Member as he lay in the Gangway, timidly return-
ing the glare of the Sage. Presently, when the Sage returned to his
consideration of the Dukes, New Member cautiously rose, crept up
the Gangway, skirted the wall under the Gallery, moved with in-
creasing pace as he neared the door, and disappeared from view. If
this was being a Member of Parliament, perhaps the defeated Candi-
dates were not the least happy of men.
Another New Member, one Mather, distinguished himself in a
fresh direction. Debate opened on Irish Question, and continued
thereon, speech after speech. When Mather got his innings,
supposed he would add some valuable remarks on the same subject.
But, with a wink at the Speaker, New Member humorously plunged
into discussion on the Education Question. Next Member resumed
discussion on Irish Question, and Mather's maiden speech stands
isolated in debate "like a fly in amber," as Sir John Lubbock
observed.
Business done.—Further Debate on Address.
A Strange Fancy.

A Wiry Couple,
first time I had ever
THE HORSES IN THE GARDEN.
Covent Garden, of course. The Great International Circus, under
the management of the People's Canterer, WnxiAH of Holland,
deserves to be a great success. Unfortunately, on the occasion of
my visit, Signor Paul Cinquevalli, "L'Incomparable," was pre-
vented by illness from performing, so I did not see what I am
informed is the most won-
derful part of the show.
But we saw Miss Jessie
0' Brien, the Lady Jockey,
a very graoeful and clever
"act," and Mr. George
Batty on the perfectly
bare-backed and reinless
steed. "What a sight
Rotten Row would be if
all equestrians were brought up to rido
&ffi^„n* r»y like Mr. Batty and Miss O'Brien, and
li- all horses trained to be so obedient! In
the hunting-field all dangers from being
dragged, in the stirrup, all chance of
girths breaking, in fact all trouble and
saddlery expenses avoided by the em-
ployment of the Bare-Backed Steed.
Then there were Miles. Elvira and
Gisella on the slack wires-;—a feat
they could have performed with ease
out-of-doors during the recent snow-
fall, when the overhead-wires were
slackened everywhere.
Miss Nellie Reid, "with her cele-
brated leaping-horse, Sydney," delighted
us; though, when I observed the word
"celebrated," I began to think how
"out of it" I must have been for
years, seeing that this was the very
^u, or even heard of, the "celebrated"
horse, Sydney. My loss I admit, and so, au reroir. What I
always love to remark is the air of disdainful indifference
assumed by the Equestrienne, when she is being carried round
the Circus by the horse at a walk, or is standing still in the intervals
between the scenes of her "act." How she ignores the Clown!
With what a lazy look of half-awakened curiosity she casually scans
the audience, apparently disposed to regard them as intruders, or
admitted as a favour to see her take ner usual riding exercise.
Then, when she can no longer refuse to recognise the existence of
Mr. Merryman, and when that eccentric Droll, with the permission
of the Ring-master, places his hand on his heart, and effusively
addresses to ner a declaration of his passion, how she looks down on
him from her saddle with a sweetly deprecating smile, as though she
would say, "Poor
fool! how I pity
thee! but how 1
despise the Ring-
master and the
public who en-
courage thee! But
there, the hoops
are ready. Away
poor Fool! and—
hoop-Id!"
A Circus is a
great pleasure to
most of us, I
imagine, greater
perhaps than, as
rational beings,
we care to admit.
There is a great
feature, great even
where all is great
in the Great Inter-
national Circus,
and that is the
Great International Band, dressed in scarlet and gold uniforms,
gallantly conducted by Marshal John Fitzgerald, who looks the
gersonincation of Martial Music in his blue and gold uniform and his
erce moustache. No wonder that, under suoh leadership, this brave
band attacks with admirable precision, accompanies the horses over
the bars, and urges them on to victory! The band of a Circus is
ordinarily a conventional affair; but this is, as I have already said,
a very strong feature of the show; and, but that we have come to
see the horses, might well have a quarter of an hour's performance
all to itself. By the way,—Happy Thought—why shouldn't the

Napoleon Holland; or, The People's Canterer.
Musicians come in mounted on horseback, and give us a Grand
Instrumental, Ornamental, and (of course) International Overture,
Entr'acte, and Finale? A Galop performed by the Orchestra on
trained steeds, conducted by Marshal Fitzgerald with his Marshal's
baton, would be something to draw all London and the Provinces.
Four ponies to one on its success. Pause, William of Holland, before
you reject for ever the idea thus offered you by such a regular beggar
on horseback as Hard Nirbs.
P.S.—Excellent House the night I was there; and, going round to
view the stables, I was glad to observe that the stalls were quite full.
PP.S.—I have not yet seen Mr. Coghlan's new drama, Enemies, at
the Prince's, written, I believe, for Mrs. Langtry. There is, I hear,
an idiot in it; not the first on the stage by many, but, I am told he
is a great idiot. That eminent and stately tragedian, Mr. Kemble,
plays, so I read in the Pall Mall Gazette, the part of a "dissolute
nobleman." All, to whom Mr. Kemble's aristocratic bearing is
familiar, will acknowledge that he must look and play the part to
perfection. Fortunate Manageress to have such a chance for a
pictorial advertisement all over London. "The Beauty! the Idiot!!
the Dissolute Nobleman!!! All now appearing at the Prince's
Theayter! WaUi up! walk up!"
Trot's Femmes pour tin Man is to be seen at the Criterion. It is said
to have been most successfully adapted by Mr. Rae. "Who?" asked
somebody a trifle deaf. "Hoo-Rae!" answered Mr. C. Wyndham
after the first night. The title in English is as clumsy as the
French—The Man with Three Wives. Why not Much Married t
or a Rae-union t
A new dramatic author has appeared. Young Mr. William
Safte. His comedy, called Speculation, produced at a matinee, was
not particularly strong or original; even the Mesmerism has been
used before in a three-act faroe at Toole's, but whose it was I for-
get. However, Mr. Sapte's is at all events a fair start, and that it
is not from a foreign source is a point in his favour. He '11 succeed

SCAECELY COMIC!
(The Latest "Funny" Story from Burmah.)
Tile luckless Prisoner, bound hand and foot, awaited tremblingly
the fatal signal. In front of him stood a file of soldiers, with loaded
rifles, prepared to deliver the death-dealing volley. In his rear a
stone wall—overhead a dear sky and a bright sun. All was ready
for the tragedy.
Then there was a far-off murmur, which increased in volume and
came nearer and nearer. What was it?
The Prisoner turned his eyes towards the quarter from whence the
sounds proceeded. He had heard of British justice, in his boyish
days he nad read an old English story, in which the condemned, on
the eve of his execution, had been reprieved. Was he reprieved?
Did this murmur, that had now grown into a shout, mean that he
was to escape from the jaws of death?
Evidently the firing-party were of that opinion, for they'' ordered'1
their arms and stood at attention. The Officer in command stepped a
a few paces forward, and awaited the instructions of the Provost-
Marshal, who he now discovered, was galloping towards him, followed
by an orderly carrying a tripod.
"Stop, stop!" shouted the Provost-Marshal, holding up his hand
in the greatest excitement, " Don't fire! Don't fire!"
Then came a mighty shout of '1 Reprieved!'' and the Prisoner raised
his eyes Bkywards, and almost fainted from excessive joy.
The Officer ordered the firing-party to unload, and brought them
into " fours right," with a view to marching them off the ground,
when he was angrily acoosted by the Provost-Marshal, whose orderly
had dismounted to fix the tripod already mentioned.
"What are you about, Sir?" he exclaimed. "Who gave you
orders to retire your men?"
"I presume, Sir, the execution is countermanded; or, at any rate,
postponed," replied the Company Officer.
"Not at all, Sir. On the oontrary, as the light is now excellent,
the sooner you get to work the better," was all the Provost-Marshal's
retort.
The Officer turned to his men once more, and, with an air of dis-
gust, gave the order to load. The Prisoner trembled in every limb
with an agitation too terrible for words. "Ready!—present!"
"Stop!'' again shouted the Provost-Marshal. "What are you
1 perhaps you
doing? I haven't got the focus yet."
"Well, Sir," replied the Company Officer, dryly,
had better give the word yourself."
"Thank you, I will," said the Provost-Marshal, withdrawing his
head from some black calico curtains to turn to the firing-party.
"And now, my men, take your time from me. As I say 'Three!' I
will remove the cover. But don't fire before or after. I want to
photograph him as he dies! One—two—three! Capital! I don't
think ne moved!"

it would nave been sufficient. It does not follow that because an
Irishman is a Protestant, he is therefore, what is termed, a Loyalist;
Mr. Parnell being a notable example to the contrary. It is such
hot burning Coals as this one, that, on both sides, are so dangerous to
the powder-magazines of the Irish temperament. In our illustration
we show Lord Cole giving an entertainment in the style of his peace-

This glowing pictorial Cole comes from a Furniss.
"THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. T. AND MR. H."
Or " Two Single Gentlemen rolled into One."
CHAPTER I.—Story of the Bore.
Mr. Stutterson, the lawyer, was a man of a rugged countenance,
that was never lighted by a smile, not even when he saw a little old
creature, in clothes much too large for him, come round the corner
of a street and trample a small boy nearly to death. The little old
creature would have rushed away, when an angry crowd surrounded
him, and tried to kill him. But he suddenly disappeared into a house
that did not belong to him, and gave the crowd a cheque with a name
upon it that cannot be divulged until the very last chapter of this
interesting narrative. Then the crowd allowed the little old creature
to go away.
Let us never refer to the subject again," said Mr. Stutterson.
"With all my heart," replied the entire human race, escaping
from his button-holding propensities.
Chapter II.—Mr. Hidanseek is found in the Vague Murder Case.
Mr. Stutterson thought he would look up his medical friends. He
was not only a bore, but a stingy one. He called upon the Surgeons
when they were dining, and generallymanaged to obtain an entrance
with the soup. "You here!" cried Dr. Onion, chuckling. "Don't
speak to me about Trektl—he is a fool, an ass, a dolt, a humbug,
and my oldest friend."
"You think he is too scientific, and makes very many extra-
ordinary experiments," said Stutterson, disposing of the fish, two
entries and the joint.
"Precisely," replied Onion, chuckling more than ever—" as you
will find out in the last Chapter. And now, as you have cleared the
table, hadn't you better go r"
"Certainly," returned the Lawyer, departing (by the way, not
returning), and he went to visit Mr. Hidanseek. He found that
individual, and asked to see his face.
"Why not?" answered the little old creature in the baggy
clothes, defiantly. "Don't you recognise me P"
"Mr. R. L. Stevenson says I mustn't," was the wary response;
"for, if I did, I should spoil the last chapter."
Shortly after this Mr. Hldanseek, being asked the way by a
Baronet out for a midnight stroll, immediately hacked his interro-
gator to pieces with a heavy umbrella. Mr. Stctterson therefore
called upon Dr. Trektl, to ask for an explanation.
"Wait a moment," said that eminent physician, retiring to an
inner apartment, where he wrote the following note:—
"Please, Sir, I didn't do it."
"Trektl forge for a murderer!" exclaimed Stutterson; and
his blood ran cold in his veins.
Chapter III.—And any quantity of Chapters to make your flesh creep.
And so it turned out that Trektl made a will, which contained a
strange provision that, if he disappeared, Hidanseek was to have all
his property. Then Dr. Onion went mad with terror, because, after
somewniskey-and-water, he fancied that his old friend Trektl had
turned into the tracked and hunted murderer, Hidanseek.
"Was it the whiskey ?" asked Stutterson.
"Wait until the end!" cried the poor medical man, and, with a
loud shriek, he slipped out of his coat, leaving the button-hole in the
bore's hand, and died!
Chapter the Last.—The Wind-up.
I am writing this—I, Trektl, the man who signed the cheque
for Hidanseek in Chapter I., and wrote the forged letter a little
later on. I hope you are all puzzled. I had no fixed idea how it
would end when I began, and I trust you will see your way clearer
through the mvstery than I do, when you have come to the imprint.
As you may nave gathered from Onion's calling me "a humbug,
&c, Ac," I was very fond of scientific experiments. I was. And
I found one day, that I, Trektl, had a great deal of sugar in my
composition. By using powdered acidulated drops I discovered
that I could change myself into somebody else. It was very sweet!
So I divided myself into two, and thought of a number of things.
I thought how pleasant it would be to have no conscience, and be a
regular bad one, or, as the vulgar call it, bad 'un. I swallowed the
acidulated drops, and in a moment I became a little old oreature,
with an acquired taste for trampling out children's brains, and hack-
ing to death (with an umbrella) midnight Baronets who had lost their
way. I had a grand time of it! It was all the grander, because I
found that bv substituting sugar for the drops I could again become
the famous doctor, whose chief employment was to give Mr. Stut-
terson all my dinner. So much bad had been divided into the acid-
ulated Hidanseek that I hadn't enough left in the sugary Trektl
to protest against the bore's importunities.
Well, that acidulated fool Hidanseek got into serious trouble, and
I wanted to cut him. But I couldn't; when I had divided myself
into him one day, I found it impossible to get the right sort of sugar
to bring me back again. For the right sort of sugar was adulterated,
and adulterated sugar cannot be obtained in London!
And now, after piecing all this together, if you can't see the whole
thing at a glance, I am very sorry for vou, and can help you no
further. The fact is, I have got to the end of my " 141 pages for a
shilling." I might have made myself into four or five people instead
of two,—who are quite enough for the money.
TO BUMBLE.
Blessed Bumble, well we know
How you treated us 'mid snow:
Left it lying in the street,
Terrible to weary feet;
Now the same insensate law
Leaves us helpless in a thaw.
Streets are wet, then in a trice
Lo! the surface gleams with ioe:
Heavy snow comes, apt to "ball.
While the toiling horses fall;
Later, Bumble sees the mud
Boll in Acherontic flood.
People, getting frantic tuite,
Letters to the Press indite;
Bumble's flabby finger goes
To his erubescent nose;
Don't they wish, he seems to say,
They may get it cleared away.
Autocrat of London town,
We are helpless 'neath thy frown;
Locomotion at thy will
Ceases, and the city's still.
Englishmen! take neart of grace.
And drive Bumble from his place!
There has, of course, been a rush of New Members to purchase
Mr. Henry Lucy's Shilling Popular Handbook of Parliamentary
Procedure. No New Member should be without this in his coat-tail
Scket. To mere outsiders it is interesting, and about as useful as a
anual of Freemasonry to any one who, being a man, is not also a
Brother. The Popular Guide will not make one of the Non-Elect
an "old Parliamentary Hand" any more than getting Carlisle's
Manual of Freemasonry by heart will make a fellow-oraf tsman of the
uninitiated. Some of the old forms and ceremonies are very
quaint, or, at all events, read so. The Popular Handbook tells us
that the Comptroller, bringing in the formal reply to the Address,
"stands at the Bar, distinguished by his uniform, holding a white
wand in his left hand and a roll in his right." The Comptroller
must look like a Fairy Baker, or the Good Genius of Her Majesty's
Household Bread. But, buy the book, it is well worth studying,
and far more real value tor the money than any ordinary reader will
get from the purchase, of the latest unwholesome pet-ooiler of the
Shilling Sensational Shudderer Series.

AMATEUR WORK.
(By a New Hand.)
Since the days of my'boyhood when, unsolicited, I re-hammered
the drawing-room grand with a quantity of old kid gloves cut in
strips, which I subsequently fastened on with paste, I have always
been of opinion—notwithstanding the fault afterwards found with
the tone of the instrument—that there was a great deal that could
be done by oneself in a house, without having recourse to outside
professional assistance, provided you only set about it in the right
way. It was, therefore, with the greatest satisfaction that I read the
following advertisement, that seemed at once to respond to the chord
that had already been struck in my own being. Here it is:—
Now ready, Price 6rf., Post free, 7d.,
AMATEUR WORK. Illustrated. For February.
Be your own Carpenter and Builder.
Be your own Decorater and House Painter.
Be your own Cabinet-Maker.
Be your own Plumber and Qasfitter.
Be jour own Organ Builder and Violin Maker.
Be your own Printer, Lithographer, and Bookbinder.
Be your own Upholsterer and Picture Frame Maker.
Be vour own Shipwright.
Make your own Furniture,
See AMATEUR WORK. The February Number Now Ready.
Now there could be no mistake about this. Here was the whole
gamut of trade, at one's very hand, to be run through without the
intervention of the tradesman. To tell the truth, much as the an-
nouncement delighted me, it did not take me by surprise, for I had
already in several domestic departments inaugurated the scheme of
"home work" with, I flatter myself, very fair prospects of success;
and though I may claim to have become my own painter and deco-
rator, and am about, I trust, to become my own builder also, still I
wished to develop into my own violin-maker, to say nothing of being,
as soon as I could manage it, my own printer, bookbinder, and up-
holsterer, and so I sent tor the Number in question; but of this more
anon. My present business is, by a reference to my own experience,
to throw such additional light upon Amateur Work, practically car-
ried out, as will induce the Deginner who might otherwise be discou-
raged, to persevere with some hope of attaining ultimate success.
And I cannot perhaps do better than begin with that simplest of all
domestic processes, the Re-papering of a Room, giving my rough notes
of my own experience of the business, jotted down at the time:—
"Commenced dining-room this morning. Flock-paper to be first
stripped off. Not having any ladder, place, with the assistance of
the man who sweeps the crossing at the corner, the sideboard on the
dining-room table, and an arm-chair on the top of that. Stand on
the arm-chair, and begin at the top. Find that the paper adheres
obstinately to the wall. CroBsing-sweeper suggests scraping it with
a carving-knife. Try it. Break a couple, and give it up. Evidently
walls require damping. Proceed to damp them at lirst with crossing-
sweeper's broom, aipped in a pail of water. No use. Only little
bits peel off. Crossing-sweeper says he thinks the walls want a
"regular good soaking." No doubt he is right, and I endeavour to
administer one by standing in the middle of the room by a con-
stantly supplied wash-tub, from which I pitch pailfulls for five
hours in all directions. Place streaming. Am informed that the
kitchen eeiling beneath has given way, and come down. Am not
surprised. To facilitate matters, I send .to the nearest Ironmonger's
for a hydrant, and go over it all once more. Efforts successful. By
tearing it first with a toasting-fork, and then dragging it forcibly
with a coal-shovel, the paper is slowly detached. Sit up all night
at it. Stick to it the next day, and the next night too, but get it
nearly all off by the afternoon of the third day.
So much for my rough notes on "preparing" the walls, to which
I can add nothing but that I fancy that the next time I had to re-
peat the process, I should certainly throw open the dining-room
windows, and set the chimney on fire, in the hopes of attracting the
notice of the Fire Brigade, as I am convinced that their prompt
arrival on the scene with their engines would, at a small cost, effect
a great economy of labour, and saving of valuable time.
But to prooeed. Being not only my own Paper-hanger, but own
Artistic Decorator as well, I had determined on a bold experiment in
taste. Half-way up the wall I intended to try a sombre dado, but
above this a frieze of, if possible, Greek dancing-figures. These last,
however, I was unable to obtain anywhere. I tried at the Stores, but
it was of no avail, and the nearest approach I could get to what I
wanted was a bundle of unused theatrical posters, the subject
I secured being one, I fancy, used in the advertising of a sensation
drama produoed some short time ago at Drury Lane, and represent-
ing two men quarrelling on a mast in the midst of a shipwreck. Of
this picture I had secured two dozen, and as the figures were life-
size, I felt no doubt that their repetition round the dining-room, above
the dado, would, though not precisely carrying out my original
design, nevertheless 'convey an impression of the exeroise of much
artistic originality and unconventional taste.
But the telling of how I dried and sized my walls, trimmed my
paper (a most troublesome process with nail scissors), and finally hung
my frieze, I must relegate to some future ocoasion.
GERMAN AS HE IS WROTE.
To all who remember with appreciation that inimitable little work,
English as She is Spoke, we can confidently recommend the perusal
of a neat and handy little volume entitled The English-German Cor-
respondent, by Hossfeld. That, however, this is by no means a
One-Hoss-feld effort, a very oursory perusal will amply testify, the
little volume in question effectually making good its promise that by
its aid " anyone acquainted with the English language will be enabled
to compose a letter in German" straight off on any commercial sub-
ject whatever. Indeed, every department of trade is touched in its
pages, and from the floating of a company to the sinking of a ship,
nothing appears to be left out. Any intending emigrant to Samoa
could not do better than provide himself with Hossfeld's Corre-
spondent, that in any international misunderstanding could be
appealed to with good, effect. What, for instance, could be better
than the following concluding sentence from the chapter headed
"Litigious Affairs :—" Wir rechnen auf Ihre freundschaftlichen.
Bemuhungen, um die streitigen Punkte auf zufrieden stellende Weise
auszugleichen " f This would pacify the most fire-eating German
Captain at once.
Lodgers in the Lane.—The Drury Lane Lodge of Freemasons
was opened a week ago. Lord Londesborough, whom we welcome
back to active service after his late most serious accident, is the
Master. _ Augustus Druriolanus, representing one side of Human
Nature, is the Senior Warden; and the very latest Solicitor-General,
Sir John Gorst, the Gorst of his former self, the Junior Warden.
Arabi Masha Broadley is the Secretary; and Mr. Pethtt, the
other side, or "little" side, of Human Nature is the Junior Deacon.
Among the members is Brother Thomas Thorne, and then Wood-
ville is next on the list; but surely this is a misprint for " Vaude-
ville,"—at all events, coming after T. Thorne, it looks very like it.
Then there are Brother Glynds (the tragic Brother), and Charles
(his friendJWYNDHAM, and Brother Herbert Campbell, the Comio
Singer. Where at the opening ceremony was Mr. Harry Payne,
with"the red-hot poker? Mr. T. H. Bolton, M.P., was present in
evening costume, wearing one of his "Extraordinary Ties,"—he
spells it " Tithes" in his Bill, but it is evidently "Ties.1' Dr. W. H.
Russell-" Square" made the speech of the evening, and the two
Wardens delighted the company with a duett, " We 're been to the
East, tee've been to the West" which was rapturously received.
The Drury Lane Lodgers kept it up till a reasonable hour, and
then went from labour to refreshment, which they found in sleep.

"The Best Hundred
Books." — A Correspondent
writes to say that Mr. Punch
was wrong in his arithmetic
last week when he told every-
one to read his eighty-nine
volumes, and make up the
difference by "reading the
last five twice over. And,"
says he, "he will then only
have done 94." No, Sir;
that note appeared in the
90th volume; this reply ap-
pears in the 90th volume, as
you will perceive. Good: you
nave finished 89 vols. You
are reading vol. 90. Good.
Take five volumes, any five,
double them. Now, either
twice five is ten, or it is not.
But, assuming the first hy-
pothesis to be true, let a —
Punch volumes, then 5a x i

i.e.. One Hundred Punch
Volumes, and there you are!
Or, if not, where are you?

Ending a pauper.
Tell me, Giles Joskin, whom your vote inclines to.
Is't the rich Rad, who only aims to use you?
Or the kind Squire? or Parson of the Parish—
Lavish of blankets?
Is it sly Joe, who's playing his own game, or
Arch-duddler Arch t Are you the dupe of "ransom,"
Or roguish land-schemes, baited with that bogus!

PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
"PROBATE, DIVORCE, AND ADMIRALTY DIVISION (DIVORCE)."
One of the privileges of those who practise at the Bar is unques-
tionably the great respect they obtain at the hands of their non-pro-
fessional relatives, when any legal point seems to require settlement.
The fact that So-and-so is a Barrister, in the lay-mind, is equivalent
to endowing So-and-so with all the attributes of a Lord Chancellor.
Thus it comes that my Maiden Aunt, who lives a very quiet, retired
life; in a secluded village in Devonshire, whenever she requires
assistance in a matter of difficulty, appeals to me for help. It happens
that this estimable lady has recently been making her will, and with
my assistance (of course, aided by her own Solicitor), has been pro-
spectively presenting my children with that pleasantly quaint little
interest, merrily known amongst lawyers as a "vested remainder."
It is Bcaroely necessary to say that while these tiresome formalities
have been in progress, my Maiden Aunt has been enjoying our hospi-
tality at Burmah Gardens.
"My dear," said my admirable relative to me one morning, "I
have never seen you in your wig and gown—can't you take me into
Court, and let me hear you conduct a case?"
As it happened, this request, at the moment, was most embarras-
sing. As luck will have it, I have noticed that whenever my Maiden
Aunt stays with us, I have no brief—this has occurred on several
oocasions —it was again the case. So I explained, that at the moment
I was devoting most of my time to Chamber practice (which I de-
scribed as the delivery of opinions on intricate points of law, and the
like), and had no time for merely appearing robed before a Judge and
Jury; a matter, I suggested, of minor importance.
"Bat surely all the greatest men at the Bar appear sometimes in
Court; don't they, my dear P" queried my Aunt.
"Oh, certainly," I replied, in an airy manner, "when they have
nothing better to do."
And then I hastened to say, that although, for the reasons I had
given, I had no special case of my own requiring decision in open
Court, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to accompany
her to a hall of justice.
"I should like to go with you where you most practise. Where
is it?" Again my Aunt's inquisitiveness became embarrassing.
"I devote most of my energies to Probate and Admiralty," I
replied, somewhat curtailing the name of my Division, because my
Aunt is very "particular, and "serious. She never goes to
theatres, and considers even Mr. Corney Grain, although most
amusing, "a sadly frivolous young gentleman."
So one morning, when the rather sudden postponement of a Sunday
School excursion into the country had disarranged my admirable
relative's list of engagements, I undertook the pleasant task of
piloting her into the Court of Admiralty. I was robed early, and,
with my Aunt by my side, I obtained admission to the well-known
realms of that most admirable authority upon all matters connected
with a life on the ocean wave, Mr. Justice Butt. Rather to my
surprise, the Court was full of ladies. There were ladies disputing
the Benches generally hypothecated to the Junior Bar, ladies in
the public gallery, ladies in the Judge's special box, ladies on the
Bench—in fact, ladies everywhere.
"This seems to be a very interesting case of shipwreck," I said to
my Aunt. "I have never noticed so many of the fair sex here
before. You will observe that anchor; " and then I gave the history
of the emblem of hope recently erected (apparently in a spirit of
raillery) in our Division. "By-and-by a silver oar will be brought
into Court," I continued, "and his Lordship on the Bench will have
the assistance of Brethren of the Trinity House, in undress naval
uniform, as assessors."
"Will you tell me who these all are, dear?" said my Aunt, look-
ing with awe at my learned friends'and colleagues.
Anxious to afford every information, I gazed round, expecting, of
oourse, to see the leader of the Court, that most excellent gentleman
and statesman, the Prince of Waxes' Attorney-General; strange to
say, the once Stage Manager of the Cambridge A.D.C. (alas! now
many years ago!), was conspicuous by his absence, but in his place
sat another distinguished Cantab, whose triumphs, however, were
ained in the Cricket Field rather than in the Theatre; and next to
im was Mr. Indebwicb:, Q.C. Among the silks, too, I noticed some
of the most eminent men at the Bar. Behind them appeared a
number of familiar faces. They belonged to Juniors like myself.
At this moment his Lordship entered the Court, which, of course,
caused a general rising. The Bench and the Bar, with gestures of
mutual respect, exchanged, greetings.
"Now," said I, in a whisper, "we shall have the Trinity Masters,
and you will hear a story of the sea that I hope will interest you."
There was a hush. The ladies craned forward, and brought their
fans and opera-glasses to the front, and a distinguished Junior read
the pleadings. I c»uld scarcely believe my ears! What had I done?
For a moment I was stunned—almost unmanned! I cursed my self a
hundred times for my carelessness. I thought of my peer children
with their " vested remainders" that could disappear in a moment if
a certain document were to be torn by a justly angry woman! I did
not dare to face my indignant Aunt! What could I say in excuse P
It seemed to me, as I listened to Mr. Inderwicx, Q.C., as that
learned advocate clearly set forth a number of necessary but embar-
rassing facts, that explanation was impossible! The wronged female
by my side was quite silent. I did not venture to look at her, but
felt that a torrent of reproaches was ready to hand to be poured on
my luckless, inconceivably silly head. Oh, why had I not inquired
of the Usher whether Admiralty cases were being taken P Or even
Probate matters would have been tolerable. But this! Here was
my Aunt actually, at my invitation, assisting at a trial that she would
never have heard of had it not been reported verbatim in all the
daily papers! It seemed like a horrible nightmare, a death-dealing
practical joke! However, now there was nothing to do but to sit
out the opening, and then withdraw with my no doubt rightly denun-
ciatory Aunt before any witnesses could be called to substantiate
Mr. Indehwick's statement.
With a white, scared face, I stonily gazed at the clock as the
hands moved slowly round. At length, after a most impressive
peroration, in which he mourned over the depravity of human
nature, as exemplified in the case under consideration, Mr. Inder-
wick resumed his seat. It was then that I ventured to address my
Aunt, in a voice trembling with deep, but suppressed emotion. I
told her that we would go now, and as a concession, to try to regain
her justly forfeited good-will, offered to accompany her to any meet-
ing with a philanthropical object that might be being held at the
moment at Exeter Hall. "Oh no, dear," replied my Aunt, to my
unbounded astonishment. "From what that gentleman has said,
it seems the case is a most interesting one—I should like to sit it
out." And she did! A. Briefless, Junior.
HARMONY FOR HIBERNIA.
Upon my word and honour,
I read T. P. O'Connor,
Till the Irish Pig
Seemed dancing a jig,
Paenell seemed an angel, and Healy a Whig,
Upon my word and honour!
We understand that Mr. T. P. O'Connor's panegyrical paean (in
two volumes) entitled, quite suitably, The ParneU Movement, has
suggested to one of our leading musicians the theme for a sort of
Musical Masque of an Arcadian character, in which the gentle spirits
of the Irish Parliamentary Party will take the leading parts. It will
be called The Qroves of Blarney. We cannot reveal the plot, which
is Irish, and therefore, of course, is kept dark. But we are happily
in a position to indicate some of the characters.
Mr. Parnell, the Coryphseus, will be a Gentle Shepherd of sweet
temper and engaging demeanour, Virgilian in style, with a dash of
Shenstone. Shy and retiring by disposition, witn so tender a heart
that even the pastoral necessity of sheep-shearing is almost too much
for him, he will be forced, by circumstances beyond his control, to
the position of King (uncrowned—the insignia of power being hateful
to him) over an Arcadian people in unwilling revolt against san-
guinary tyranny. One touching point in the piece is when, at the
moment when he -should be mounting the Car of Triumph in the final
procession, he is discovered, with his coat off, ciphering assiduously
at a more than usually puzzling and lop-sided Subscription List.
Mr. Bigoar plays the part of a Niobe-like Nymph, with more
than the Mulberry One's capacity for "turning on the main." This
lachrymose creature is a swineherdess, in the sense in which Circe
was so over the companions of Ulysses after their transformation.
She is not ashamed of her occupation, or, indeed, of anything, her
utter imperviousness to that emotion being the "note" of her cha-
racter, and the pride and joy of her companions. But though un-
ashamed, she is in other matters of so exquisite a sensibility, that a
single " Bravo!" has been known to cause her to "burst into tears."
Mr. Justin M'Carthy takes the role of a truly Virgilian Swain,
with a taste for eclogues, and a fondness for kid.
Mr. Sexton is a village Demosthenes, whilst Mr. T. D. Sullivan
is the Tyrtajus of the fields.
Mr. Arthur O'Connor, on the contrary, is the three Parcte rolled
into one—cold as Clotho, lethal as Lachesis, and inexorable as
Atropos—in appearance. At heart he is as sentimental as Letitia
Landon, and as punctiliously humanitarian as a Spectator anti-
vivisectionist.
Mr. Healy will " create" a very complex part, involving psycho-
logical problems more subtle and insoluble than any of Mr. Robert
Louis Stevenson's. In the piece he will be found at his best at night,
whioh he always passes in sleepless contrition for the impetuous—out
well meant—insolences and outrages which characterise his daily
walk and conversation.
Gentle O'Kelly, rollicking Eeward Leamy, urbane O'Brien,
tender-souled T. P. O'Connor himself, and others of the simple
saintly set are fitted with rilee equally appropriate.

WHO'S TO FILL IT?
The Report of the Dock Yard Management Committee, dated January 12th,
is now published, and furnishes some interesting information as to the duties
devolving, under the new regulations, upon the Civil Assistant to the Admiral
Superintendent. According to the Report, the functions to be discharged by
this ubiquitous official are of no common kind. Not only is he expected to
advise the Admiral "on all questions of a professional or technioal character,"
but also to act as a sort of moral buffer between his chief and the heads of the
various Departments in the Yard, as he will "be held responsible as between
the Admiral and the Departmental Officers for the distribution of labour." He
is further to be looked to "to report all hindrance or irregularity of work,"
"to take cognisance of any idleness on the part of the subordinate officers or
men," and keep himself so well informed of the progress of all the current work,
that he " can furnish the Superintendent at any hour with the state of opera-
tions at any part of the Yard." But the demands on his activity and intelli-
gence do not end here. It is added that, to enable him to do this, he will be
called upon "constantly, and at uncertain intervals, to visit the various parts
of the Yard, including the various workshops and all ships on board of which
workmen are employed."
The fulfilment of this last duty, which, necessitating, as it does, an unbounded
activity with a capacity for suddenly springing on to the scene and turning up
quite unexpectedly, seems to indicate some acquaintance with previous training
as a pantomime sprite, ought to test severely the physical powers of the Civil
Assistant. That the Authorities regard it in this light is clear, from their
expression of opinion that though he be allowed an office in which to retire, he is
not when there "to bo hampered" by any work whatever—a judicious provision,
which may enable him to recover himself for another round. He is, however,
warned that whatever irregularities he may discover, he "must observe the
greatest courtesy" in their detection; a direction he might possibly comply
with by bursting in on his inquisitorial visit, hat in hand,with a smile on nis
countenance and some such polite phrase as, " I hope I don't intrude!" or " Pray,
don't mind me!"
On the whole, the duties of the new Civil Assistant to
the Admiralty seem to demand the exercise of both moral
and physical qualities of a high order; and it is to be
hoped that whoever gets the appointment will be pre-
pared to display simultaneously a remarkable fund of
refined intelligence, gymnastic activity, and diplomatic
tact.
• •
It is to be hoped that the Duke of Edinburgh's recent
visit to Berlin has turned out entirely to His Royal High-
ness's satisfaction, and that he managed in his double
interview with Prince Bismarck to get the figure he had
fixed on for the sale of his rights of succession to the
Dnchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. One thing looks well. He
met the reigning Duke, with whom he had such dis-
agreeables in 1883, and appears to have "made it up"
with that potentate. This is as it should be, for it is
only fitting that the Duke, when bent on raising a little
money, should, as a matter of course, take care to be on
a-ood terms with his Uncle.
Whatever disadvantages are popularly supposed to
attach to a residence in Eastern Europe, at the present
moment, certainly expensiveness of living cannot be
reckoned amongtnem. It appears that the Montenegrin
patriot, Peko PaulovrrcH, not long since received, a
grant of land from the Servian Government, and £3 a
month, upon which sum he managed to support an entire
family of thirteen persons (including five children) in
"comparative comfort." This feat, that would startle
even a British farm-labourer, he, however, was destined
completely to eclipse, when a change oi Government
ocourring, he had to betake himself to Bulgaria. _ Here
his pension was cut suddenly down to five shillings a
week, but Peko Paulo vttch seems to have managed to
moke ends meet even on this reduced stipend, and
though he is at the present moment at Odessa, on his way
to visit his son at Orenburg, apparently rather hard up,
yet, no doubt, he will soon turn up again at Tirnova,
and begin practising his highly successful economy as
rigidly as ever. The statistics he could furnish would
be invaluable in this season of agricultural depression, in
the midst of falling prices and general indigence. Mr.
Vecu ought to get hold of him at once.
NOT PICCADILLY ROAD.
(Street Ballad sung by he New Thoroughfare.)
Ah! call me anything you please.
"Haymarket Gardens," if you choose.
Or, planted all my length with trees,
"Boulevard" perhaps might suit your views?
Or "Cranbourne Row/' or " Seven Dials Place,"
No matter—I can bear the load.
But oh I do not my site deface,
And name me "Piccadilly Rood!"
11 " Bradlaugh Avenue" were vain
Some other names the case might meet.
There's " Arch," or even " Chamberlain."
Would both sound well tacked on to " Street."
"Grand Old Man Lane" some tastes might strike,
And pay in part a debt long owed:—
But there,—pray call me what you like,
But oh! not a Piccadilly Road!"
EXCESSIVE MODESTY.
The Timet suggests that possibly the reason why
wealthy Londoners and others do not eagerly compete for
the honour of helping forward the proposed Beaumont
People's Palace at the East End, is that Millionnaires are
so modest! If that is really the reason of the indispu-
table and discreditable fact that our Millionnaires display
so little munificence and public spirit, Punch can only
parody the popular couplet, and say:—
"Such 'modesty' admits of no defence,
For want of public pluck is want of
Let the Millionnaires "do good," not necessarily "by
stealth," but with open boldness, by sending in their
spare thousands to the Beaumont Trustees for this ex-
cellent work; and if they "find it fame." Mr. Punch
assures them they will have no sort of need to " blush."

cruelly for the last seven months, but feel aU right again now you've
come back. If there is a Minister I like to have about me, it s you.
I feel so safe. No wars abroad. No turmoil at home. No blowing
up of railway-stations all around us, as that funny Randolph says.
We can all sleep in our beds—or perhaps I should say in our berths

Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Your M-j-sty does me too much honour.
The Qu-n. Hot at all. They talk about dismemberment of the
Empire, and all that. But now you're at Downing Street, and
Edinburgh's in charge of the Mediterranean Fleet, all my anxieties
are over. By the way, how would you like to have Connaught as
Lord Protector in Ireland?
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Ahem! Your M-j-sty will remember that old
associations and memories would make the Dish a little chary about
welcoming a Lord Protector. They had one once, yon know.
The Qu-n. Yes, I forgot that; but whatever you do, don't have
me up to town again to open another Parliament. I caught a very
bad cold last week.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. I solemnly assure your M-j-sty that we shall
now get on all right. The necessity for a dissolution is not within
measurable distance, though what the dim and distant future may
bear in its bosom, is more than I can say.
The Qu-n. Very well, I trust you entirely. Go on and prosper,
and don't let us have any more dissolutions and crises.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne (brightening up—he hadn't expected to be received
so graciously). Your M-j-sty doesn't often visit the theatres nowa-
days, though I believe the Duke of Ed-nb-rgh is not averse, upon
occasion and terms, to take a box. But if you will graciously permit

HENGLER'S AND HORSIER."
Hating become, after a good many years of play-seeing and circus-
viewing, rather blast of these favourite amusements, I now frequently
take with me, to help me in forming an opinion anent the merits of
a performance, a young gentleman I call Tommy the Tester." He
has been brought up, so to speak, to the business. He is still of
very tender years, and only two seasons ago so took to heart "the
Demon of Mischief " at a pantomime, that he had to be consoled with
buns and acidulated drops in the Refreshment Department. Last
year he accompanied me to see Mr. Toole in Paul Pry, when he
laughed so much that we were nearly turned out for creating a
disturbance. If I had not threatened him with loss of his pudding
at his dinner for a week (whioh more or less sobered him), our
presence would not have been tolerated. This year ho has greatly
grown both in body and mind, and combines with the keen enjoy-
ment of extreme youth the critical acumen of considerable experience.
When I told Tommy the Tester that I proposed taking him to see
the Steeple-Chase at Mr. Hengler's establishment, he confessed that
he had long wished to visit the Circus where, he reminded me, the
favourite drama of Rookwood and the popular "Staghunt" had
been performed when " he was quite a child, eighteen months ago."
It was a matter of some regret to us to find that a part of the
programme was over before we reached Argyll Place. However, we
were so delighted with the performance of a young lady, called
Mile. Fontainebleau, that we quickly dried our tears, and enjoyed
her gambols with a number of poodles.
"Why is she called Mile. Fontainebleau?" asked the Tester.
"Isn't that a place in France?"
"Quite so," I returned, always ready to afford information. "If
she had been English, she would have been called Miss Margate,
—for Fontainebleau is the French for the pleasant Thanet watering-
place of which you have heard so much."
This seemed to give the Tester much food for reflection, until the
antics of a most accomplished gentleman dressed as a jockey, called
forth the question, whether if he " were really racing they would let
him ride like that?" As "riding like that" was an allusion to a
seat seemingly on the extreme tip of the horse's tail, I was forced
to confess that, without being myself strictly a sporting man, I
imagined that no set of Stewards would permit it. At the " wheezes"
of Sandy and Yorick, the Tester simply screamed, putting his head
on the cushion of the box, and rolling it about in an ecstasy of
merriment. He was also tickled at "the American Riding Machine"
although he doubted the genuineness of the victims selected from the
audience for a lesson. He was less satisfied with the "Lancers'
Quadrille," danced en militaire, on horseback, pointing out that
"they didn't know how to salute as be had seen it done by the Guards
at Wellington Barracks." The length of the preparations for the
wonderful bicycle troupe caused some grumbling which, however,

was appeased by buns. When we did see their performances, how-
ever, both the Tester and myself applauded loudly. A rather scornful
lady, in a riding habit, who made her thoroughbred do everything
but anything au naturel, earned from my young companion the
verdict of "Well, after all, it's very clever!" He was less satisfied
with a very fat acrobat, who, seemingly when he had nothing better
to do, jumped on to the shoulders of his daughter, observing indig-
nantly, that " that wasn't the way to treat your children."
By this time, the hour had arrived for the event of the evening,
the "Steeple-chase." My young friend, the Tester, took much
interest in the preliminaries, asking numerous questions aboutweights,
colours, and welshing. I may say, at once, that the representation
was most admirable. However, we were rather puzzled at two un-
couth creatures, who had a great deal to say, of a quaint, humorous
character. Neither the Tester nor I could make out who they were
intended to represent, as they appeared to be a cross between scare-
crows and North-American Indians. At last my infant companion
uttered an exclamation of delight and shouted
"I know who they are! One of 'em said 'Bedad!'—they must
be meant for Irishmen!"
The Tester was perfectly right, as an examination of the programme
proved them to be "Hibernian Sportsmen." For all this, the
Steeple-chase was most realistic, although certainly, on account of
the narrowness of the course, the horses had to follow one another
like University boats at a bumping race. To conclude—" All's well
that ends well," and the performances ended well—before eleven.

To them as is not aware of the werry

there should, be amost thirty of the
werry hiest hofficers in Her Majesty's
millintary service as is candy-
dates for about seven pound a
week and the ire of an horse on
speshal ocasions. I thinks as
this last derangement is rather
shabby, I shood have thort as
how the Copperashun knowing
the himportance of striking a
mob, wood have bort an horse
for their Feild Marshall as
wood have struck everyboddy,
say a 17 or 18 hands hire, and
have guv it him. However
that is only a dtail to whioh one
need not "hang werry much
importense.
I have seed all the Candid-
dates, at least in print, from
the werry hiest, the Major
General, down to the werry lowest, the Clark in the Controller's
Office, so I spose as the Controller is a Solger, tho' I shoodn't hev
thought it to look at him. Ah, one may easily think to whose nobil
figger my memory fondly turns when trying to realise a moddel City
Feud Marshall. Need I menshun the onered name of Wlddycum?
With that egsperienced Weteran marshalling his forces in Gildhall
Yard on Lord Mare's Day how needless would be the trembling
anksiety of his Lordship and all his warking Gentlemen as to the
successful turning round of the Carridge of state with its six power-
ful horses and their six tugging and prespiring grooms! There has
been a tork of arsking Mr. Sam Burn, the sillybrated hartist, to take
the post on account of his butiful riding, but it was thort he would
not draw so well in that capassity as in his ordinary one, or rather
in his extraornerry one.
As far as I remember the Queen herself has only got one Feild
Marshall, so I spose as she coudn't werry well spare him, or else a
good seven pound a week woodn't be a bad edition to no one's
incum. I nose as I shood think so. Marshall Pontteex Maximts
was also thought of, but it was found as he coudn't posserbly be
spared from his himportant dooties of Ward Clark, or we shood hev
had such a City Marshall, and a Marshalless two, for briteness and
dignerty, as the City ain't offen seed.
It was thort at one time of putting ewery candiddate through his
most diffycult tarsk, that of riding on horseback all the way from
the Mansnun House to Gildhall, with ony two Policemen to take care
of him, right through the hole traffick in Cheapside, but sum of the
werry boldest on 'em begged to be xcused from the terryble hawdeal
unless acumpanied by the Lord Mare, but it is said they are all to
ride up and down King Street wunce, and three times round Gild-
hall Yard, on the morning of eleotion, and the Police Surgeon is to
be in atendance in case of haccidents.—One enthoosiastick Common
Councilman wentured to surgest that all the thirty candidates should
be dressed in their full regimentals and mounted on thirty of
Sanger's most butiful horses, should preseed the Lord Mare on his
way to Gildhall on tho day of Election. Wot a brillyant idcar!

a sort of connection of mine. We are both related to the Royal

am going to write to Bismarck.

Hartlnoton. First-class Chief. In spite of having his room
(which is much better than my old one), I wish I had him back.
The place not much altered. 1 .thought they would find out some
day about those bayonets!

have ordered a snub to be administered to Australia generally and
collectively, and am going to employ the remainder of the day in
snoozing. How sorry Bismarck will he to lose me! He always used
to call me Too sleepy to finish the sentence.
Local Government Office.—Hard lines! Wouldn't let me be
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and wanted me to turn into a First
Lord of the Admiralty? "Not if I knows it. Not for Joseph—I
never was meant for the sea!" Enough to drive me back to the
screws! I would cut the whole affair, only I think I shouldn't now
have a chance of getting on to the Vestry, and I can't do without
political life.

fying! Hadn't an idea I was so popular. Thepeople took the horses
out of my carriage, and dragged me here. Very pleased indeed.

that article in the Fortnightly, to which the Archbishop took such
exception. Who'd ha' thought of his reading it! Just laid down
my pen to receive an enthusiastic deputation, who brought with
them a casket for my acceptance. Most kind of them! Always said

POETRY ON THE CHEAP.
A somebody calling himself "Lochnell" has perpe-
trated a volume entitled Saxon Lyrics and Legends,
after Aldhelm, in imitation, apparently, of the un-
rhymed, and not too rhythmical, effusions of the "old
Saxon minstrels or gleemen." The fact that "in the
dimness of the bygone years " the Abbot of Malmesbury,
who knew no better, indulged in this irregularly
chopped-up prose, cannot be accepted as an excuse for
"Lochnell," who ought to know better, vexing the
ears of nineteenth-century readers with this peculiarly
aggravating sort of "verse-making," as he ingenu-
ously calls it. This is the sort of thing that meanders
jerkily through over a hundred pages:—
Then sing I only
For myself.
The nightingale

No wonder! One pities poor Philomela compelled

a crow complain. If " Lochnell" sang only for him-

He prints his "poetry," and puts a price upon it.
Poetry, quotha! Touchstone is here outdone. The
"right butterwoman's rank to market" is not'in it
with Lochnell's jumpy doggerel. "I'll rhyme you so
eight years together, says Touchstone, in ridicule of
amorous Orlando's false gallop of verses. But here be
no rhymes even; so Touchstone's task would be still
easier. As thus :—

THE MINISTERIAL CRISIS.
(From the Doorstep and Keyhole News Association.)
E have authority
to state that Mr.
Gladstone rose
as usual this
morning. He had
tea and toast
(dry), and was
overheard to ask
for an egg. It
would not, per-
haps, be well to
attach too much
importance to this
fact. But it is
well known that
in certain circum-
stances a great
deal more comes
out of an egg
than meets the
eye at first
glance.
Precisely at five
minutes past
nine Earl Gran-
ville (who wore
an overcoat)
called, and was
at once admitted.
We have autho

All Eyes and Ears
rity to state that a report circulated yesterday, by a rival association,
alleging that vesterday morning Earl Granville called at ten minutes
to ten, is wholly without foundation. It was ten minutes past. We
are not able to say precisely how long Lord Granville remained in
consultation. We have, indeed, reason to believe that he must have
departed by the back-door, for the utmost vigilance on the part of
our Representative failed in tracing his subsequent movements.
The noble Lord was followed at twenty minutes to ten by Lord
Harttngton, who had walked over from Lord Granville's, having
unfortunately just missed the 'bus. Lord Harttngton was evidently
in deep thought, his hat being slightly tilted over his eyes, and one
hand (the right) in his pocket. Our Representative closely followed
his Lordship, there being some reason to expect that, if he drew his
hand out of his pocket, it might be seen
whether he was holding a piece of paper,
which might contain his hnal.ref usal to accept
office. His Lordship, unfortunately, miscon-
strued the intention of our Representative, and
suddenly drawing his right hand out, narrowly
missed bringing it in contact
with the nose of our Repre-
sentative. But public duty
must be performed; and this
incident is only mentioned as
indicating the temper
which the noble Lord ap-
proached Mr. Gladstone.
On knocking at the door, he
was admitted immediately.
The interview lasted twenty
minutes, and our Represen-
tative, following at a safe
distance, is able to state g
that his Lordship emerged
upon the Park, and walked
in the direction of Piccadilly.
At five and a half minutes
past eleven, some sensation
was created by the appear-
ance at the end of the Terrace
of Lord Randolph Cirra-
chill. Our Representative,
sitting on the kerbstone, and
producing his "flimsy," had commenced to write a despatch clearly
indicating an attempt to form a Coalition Government. It would
have made a good bit of lineage, but Lord Randolph, after looking
up the Terrace, pulled at bis moustache, and walked down the Duke
of York's steps in a south-east-by-east-half-west direction. We
had at one time thought of completing our Representative's sketch of
the Coalition Government, and sending it to the evening papers,
with intent to contradict it in the morning issues. But accuracy has
ever been our object, and truth our pole-star.

Startnigtou.
At ten minutes past eleven Mr. Chamberlain drove up in a four-
wheeler. It was noticed that he wore an eyeglass. It was further
observed that he carried an umbrella, though the forecast of the
weather for the day—" Same as No. 5 "—did not warrant the pre-
caution. We have reason to believe that this was meant as a
demonstration, designed to intimate to Mr. Gladstone that there
were more umbrellas than one, and that, if Mr. Chamberlain did
not get his own way, he might be forced to raise his. He was imme-
diately admitted. He remained in consultation with Mr. Gladstone
for only eleven minutes.
On issuing he was met on the door-step by Mr. John Morley, and
the two remained in earnest
conversation for five minutes.
Our Representative ap-
proached, and fumbled at the
bell for some time, meaning,
if the door opened, to ask
whether Mr. Smith lived
there. The ruse, however,
though well planned, was not
successful, and nearly led to
disastrous results. Our Re-
presentative overheard no-
thing, whilst the footman who
opened the door said he (our
Representative) "knowed very
well that Mr. Smith didn't
live there; that he had been
seen lurking about the place
for some days; and that, if
caught there again, would be
given into custody.
A penny a line does not
soothe feelings thus wounded;
and it is only a sense of public
duty that sustains our Repre-
sentative in these trying times.
Lord Richard Grosvenor was in and out all day, perhaps on the
whole more in than out. At twelve o'clock Lord Rosebert and the
Marquis of Ripon arrived, arm-in-arm. They were at once admitted,
but remained only a short time, from which it may be inferred that
Mr. Gladstone had nothing to say to them. Messengers were in
attendance, and were busily employed running to and fro between
Carlton House Terrace and the resi-
dences of other Ministers-designate.
Our Representative intercepted seve-
ral of these messengers, and, with
his usual urbanity, proposed to save
them the trouble of carrying the
despatches. The offer was in each
case firmly, though not politely,
declined.
At one o'clock Mr. Trevelyan
drove up in a hansom. He remained
in consultation for twenty minutes.
On , emerging, he walked in the
direction of Pall Mall.
We are able to state, upon the
highest authority, that Lord Salis-
bury will not remain Foreign
Minister after the completion of
Mr. Gladstone's Ministry. Such a
course would obviously be as inconvenient as it is unprecedented.
We are authorised to state that the report that Mr. Herbert

"The Royal Liver Society."—In answer to numerous Corre-
spondents who have seen this heading, but are too busy to study the
reports in the papers, we beg to explain that the object and raison
d etre of this Society are, as evidenced in its title, the preservation
of the Royal Constitution. The Presidents are Her Gracious Majesty
and H.R.H. the Prince of Wales. The Consulting Medical Men
belong to the Royal Household, assisted by Dr. Ucain, with power to
add to their number. There is a yearly subscription, and for this,
every member is entitled to a certain number of boxes of podophyl-
lin pUls and other Liver prescriptions, signed by the Committee.
The Rules of the Society enjoin daily exercise on horseback if possible ■
if notj on foot, or bicycle, or gymnastic. The Mounted Members of
the Liver Society may ohoose their own hours for horse exercise in
the Park, or where they will. When H.R.H. the President takes
his regulation ride in the Row, all the members of the Liver Society
are expected to be present attended by their Livery servants. Those
members who have no stables of their own are bound to use Livery
stables. For further particulars ask anybody.

DECORATIONS EOR DOCTORS.
Dear Dr. Punch,
As the universally recognised representative of the Medical
(as of every other) Profession, you doubtless read, with frequent
interjections of " Hear, hear!" an admirable oration lately delivered
on its behalf at Netley Hospital by Dr. Q,uain. "He would gladly
see some special recognition of the services of .Medical Officers, and it
would be a great and gracious act of the Queen to institute a decora-
tion, which might be called ' The Order for Medical Merit.'" Allow
me to say, with a slight reservation, "Ditto to Dr. Quain." I wish
Her Most Gracious Majesty would, by and with the advioe of her
trusty Councillor, the G. 0. M., be pleased to award some special
recognition to meritorious medical men. Only, I had rather that it
should be something other than a decorative Order. Distinguishing
Titles would not be bad things, such as the Marquis of Magnesia,
Baron Bluepill, and bo forth; and why not, as there's a Count
Hunyadi Janos? If I were meritorious enough, I should be not above
accepting a Peerage. In case the Sovereign created Sir J amiss Paget

practice;, and cry, " Hooray I" A distinguished Physician or Surgeon
would be not only ornamental, but useful in the House of Lords. As
such, I would willingly take a Dukedom, or even an Earldom, if I
had amassed enough money to maintain the dignity. But I shouldn't

Fancy Harvey, or John Hunter, particularly fancy Abernethy
going about with a medal or a strip of silk or satin attached to the
portion of attire anterior to his pectoral region. I can't fancy myself

I were privileged to wear Mr. Jeahes's shoulder-knot. But then I

sible for yours, truly, an ancient Sawbones.

By a Nervous Sciolist.
Bacillus v. Bacterium ! _
The case put so looks passing rum.
Yet we are told that in our bodies
They wage wild war, which vastly odd is.
When a bacterium would kill us,
We may be saved by a bacillus.
Complaints, from phthisis to hysteria,
Are probably due to bacteria.
Bacteria your lungs attack,
Import bacilli in a crack,
Ana the new guests, if sound and bold ones,
Will instantly expel the old ones.
So we 're the battle-field of germs!
At such a thought one rather squirms;
It gives a nervous man the fidgets
To think these microscopic midgets
Within our frames are always going it,
And commonly without our knowing it.
We all must learn, though, willy-nilly,
Whioh are bacteria, which bacilli;
For those are foes, whilst these are friends,
And therefore everything depends
On whether our lung- guest mysterious
Is a bacillum or bacteriut,—
No, no, thaVs wrong, I'm getting mixed,
I must acquire a knowledge fixed.
Strange that such difference should be
'Twixt tweedledum and tweedledee;
Or rather (hope it's all a hum!)

one at Monaco. '' Regardless of their doom, the
little victims play" and oddly enough it is only
when there's "not another shot in the locker1'
that the pigeon-shooting really commences.
Another strange thing is, that the hardest hit

There came to me tidings of grace
From a Breach of Promise case,
And a chance of relief from an old, old grief, with my

When 1 read about Counsellor Winch,
Who can help a poor chap, at a pinch,
To get rid without fuss of that dread incubus, a cantan-
kerous Mother-in-law.
I confess that I fail to see
What the subtle procedure can be
Of his occult art, to allay the smart of my chronic do-

Oh. wise philanthropist, where
Did you 'light on that secret rare.
Which, you hinted one day, would at once o

And inconveniently lean,
With the beard of a goat, and a wrinkled throat like an

Her temper is awfully bad.
She looks upon me as a cad-
No tongue can tell the attributes fell of my vile old
Mother-in-law!
I must hasten a bargain to clinch
With the wily, ingenious Winch.
If I ask him to dine, perhaps in the wine with which she
moistens her maw
He may drop a soluble pill,
Or some delicate drug that will
In a quiet way the mischief play with my gruesome
Mother-in-law.
Or, possibly—who can tell ?—
He may know some potent spell
To waft her afar to a distant star, clutched fast in an

But I should not envy the Djinn

To redress the wrongs of man,
Be it dagger or bowl, I declare on my soul that I do not

But I promise to sing his praise
In superior votive lays,
When, my sorrow to ease, he shall graciously please to
"remove" my Mother-in-law.'
WHERE ARE WE NOW?
January 1.-—The Chief Commissioner of Police, by way of giving
London dogs a nice New Year's Present, issues the following
order:—
"All Bogs found in the streets without muzzles will be instantly
lassoed and shot. Owners will be required to carry their Dog licence,
properly framed, suspended by a chain round their necks, or on some
other conspicuous part of their persons. Dogs not previously shot
will be suffocated at the 'Battersea (Long) Home for Lost Dogs,'
and the owner, if found, will be required to pay the expenses of
suffocation and subsequent burial, and to enter into his own recog-
nisances to come up for judgment when called for."
January 5.—" Nothing gives so much innocent pleasure as a little
variety," says the Chief Commissioner, and signs this new notice:—
"The Order of January 1, with regard to Dogs, is hereby rescinded.
Dogs are not required to be muzzled in the streets, or anywhere else.
Nobody need take out a licence, unless he wants to do so. If Dogs
are not under proper control, the Police arc recommended to look the
other way. Should a Dog insist on following a Policeman to the
'Battersea (Long) Home,' the Committee of the Home will be happy
to keep him for one month certain, after which time he will not be
suffocated, but merely 'narcotised,' and a suitable tablet erected to
his memory."
January 10.—Owing to the Chief Commissioner's little finger having
been snapped at as a tempting morsel by a stray Ijpx Terrier, the
following peremptory Order to Constables has been issued:—
"Dogs, especially Fox Terriers, to be destroyed when seen!
Policemen are recommended to carry with them (in their helmets) a
sponge soaked in chloroform, a bludgeon, and an Express rifle, all of
which are likely to come in handy when tackling a particularly
ferocious cross between a Siamese Bulldog and a Siberian Blood-
hound. Outside the six-mile radius, Dogs on a first appearance in
any public plaoe to be warned, and on a second offence to be invited
to accompany the Constable to Battersea.
"N.B.—The Secretary of the 'Battersea (Long) Home' wishes to
correct a misapprehension. Dogs sent to the Home will neither undergo
suffocation nor narcotisation, but a process of antesthetisation, termi-
nating in their deaths."
January 20.—The Chief Commissioner's medical adviser having
pronounced that he is in no danger from the snap of the Fox Terrier,
as the skin has not been even broken, consents to publish an
amended Order to the following effect:—
"Dogs must either be led, or muzzled, or otherwise. Within the
six-mile radius it will be enough if they are accompanying their
masters, provided they do not stray more than twenty varus in front,
or on one side, or behind, or otherwise. Policemen will carry yard-
measures in their pockets to measure distances. Dogs without
muzzles are still liable to be lassoed or otherwise, and taken to the
'Dogs' (Long) Home at Battersea.' where they will either be'suffo-
cated, or narcotised, or otherwise.
January 25.—All the above Orders are rescinded, pending the
result of a medical inquiry into the mental condition of the Fox
Terrier that snapped at the Chief Commissioner's little finger. A series
of entirely neto Orders is confidently expected in a few days.

THE REASON WHY?
Tile Timet Correspondent at Cairo, commenting the other morning
on the effect produced in Diplomatic circles there by the news of the
Ministerial changes in progress at home, says—" The political crisis in
England has caused a complete stagnation in the Diplomatic world very startling order as to warrant "complete stagnation" in the
here; and the Khedive, Sit H. D. Wolff, Sir E. Baking, Mt/khtar Diplomatic world, or, for the matter of that, "general frivolity"
Downing Street, does not necessarily mean a change of policy on
the Nile. They surely ought to realise, that whoever are in"
or whoever are "out," we somehow seem capable of only playing
"the same old gamo" in Egypt, over and over again. Anyhow,
judging by the published reports, it may fairly be said that the
achievements of the late Government have not been of such a
Pasha, and Nubar Pasha are in-
dulging in general frivolity, balls,
and dinners, as if realising that the
advent of a Liberal Government to
power meant the cessation of any
serious attempt at a settlement of
the Egyptian Question." That the
illustrious personages referred to
above should, whue waiting for
news, allow themselves the privilege
of a little extra dancing and dining
seems natural enough; but what is
meant by their indulging in " general
frivolity?" Does it imply a raid on

it be the acknowledged failure of all
his recent efforts at negotiation to
put the Soudan business on a more
satisfactory footing. This perhaps,
as revealed in the publication of the

somewhat akin to frivolity, and pos-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AMATEUR WORK.
By a New Sand.
I have already described the process of "preparing the walls of a
room for papering," but before I dismiss the.subject, and prooeed to
something else, I ought to say a few words as'to the general condition
of dampness in which I found them to have been left by the neces-
sary drenching to which they had been subjected. To dry them as
speedily as possible was my first object; and not exactly knowing
where to obtain a brazier, I conceived the happy idea of contracting
with several itinerant vendors of hot chestnuts to pass their day in
the dining-room with me, bringing their apparatus with them. At
first, though we made a comfortable partv of seven, there was no
perceptible increase in the temperature; but, finding this, I soon
remedied it by buying up the respective stocks-in-trade of my
various guests, and relegating them to the kitchen for dinner. I then
plied their braziers assiduously with coke until I had established a
thoroughly good white heat all round. And this I continued for ten
days, by the end of which time, though the amount of my butcher's
book was considerably increased. (I having meantime become respon-
sible for the daily board of the proprietors), the walls were so com-
pletely dried as to have cracked in all directions, and shrunk away
from the woodwork of both the door and window-frames, which had
themselves started at all their joints, and refused either to open or
to shut, or to fall into their proper places again.
But I only mention this experience by the way. My main object,
on the present occasion, being to describe how I fulfilled the mandate
of Amateur Work.—"Be your own Chimney Sweep."
Having decided that before I put on the paper, it would be as well
to get through with this domestic operation, I proceeded forthwith
to make all my arrangements. But the following rough-hand notes,
jotted down at the time, will perhaps best convey some idea of how I
carried on the process, and be of value to anyone, who like myself, is
disposed to attempt it without professional assistance.
Commenced preparations for sweeping the dining-room chimney
this morning. Began at 7 a.m. by removing the handles from
all the brooms, and the poles from all the window-curtains in
the house. To the longest of these latter I fasten in the place of
the ordinary sweep's brush, a good- sized Christmas tree that we
happen to have over from a New Tear's children's party, on the
premises. By dint of great exertion, manage, after removing the top
of the register with a coal-hammer, to get this sufficiently far up the
chimney to enable me to make the first join, which I do by tightly
strapping on a second pole to that already attached to the Christmas
tree. Having effected this, I push vigorously, but feel I am making
so little way, that I determine to send in to the man who lives next
door but one, to ask him to come round and lend me a hand. He does.
Our united efforts succeed in forcing the second pole fairly out of
sight, but by the quantity of bricks and mortar that come down the
chimney as we " make way," for a couple of hours, with the "one,
two, three, and now altogether, boys," with which we try to enliven
our labour, I fancy things can't be going quite all right. Manage,
however, to start a third pole, but after getting a foot of it up, it
sticks hopelessly. Can't get it back again either.
The man from the next door but one suggests sending to the
corner of the Square to ask the retired Colonial Bishop, who has
"had experience in sweeping chimneys in the Bush," to step round
and give his advice. Send for him. He comes. Explain to him
that we have got a tree up the chimney on the top of three curtain-
poles, and can't get it to go one way or the other. He says he is not
surprised, and that the only way to sweep a chimney with a tree is
to do it " from above," and let it down with a rope from the top of
the house. Determine to do it. Ask the retired Colonial Bishop if
he will mind getting out on the roof, and letting the roasting-jack,
attached to a rope, down the chimney, in the hope of catching the
tree with the hook, and pulling it up. Hesitates a little, but
finally, on being much pressed, takes off his coat and apron, and
complies. Go out in the road to look at him. Crowd assembling.
Perilous position—but he pays out the rope capitally. He shakes
his head. Evidently he can't " bite" the tree. I halloa up to him,
"Never mind—try again!" People next door send in to sav that
the roasting-jack has come straight into their soup, and nearly put
out their kitchen-fire, and they are sending for a policeman.
Make signs to Colonial Bishop that he has mistaken the chimney.
At last he sees me, and tries another. Shakes his head again. Again
shout out to him not to mind, but to have another try. He does.
Nods his head. All right this time. He has evidently caught the
roasting-jack in something, for he is tugging now with all his might
and main. Great cheering from the crowd. Go in and see whether
the polo has made any advance. The man from the next door but
one says it hasn't budged :in inch. Sudden shout from crowd. Rope
has broken, and Bishop has rolled backwards through roof. Fortu-
nately not much hurt. Says, however, he has left the roasting-jack
in the chimney, and that the only course now is to ascend it from
the dining-room. Try this, and find it quite impossible!
The'man:from the|next-door but one suggests "opening it up."
Determine that this is the only course, and send for a pickaxe.
Commence by making a tremendous hole over the dining-room
mantelpiece. ..Hack away, following course of chimney up to ceiling,
finally being held, on to top of sideboard stood on end sideways by
man from the next door but one and Colonial Bishop, when, by a
supreme effort, I bring the drawing-room hearthstone down suddenly
on our three heads.
And here I may as well pause in my narrative to state that the
upshot of our efforts was the recovery of the tree, the roasting-jack,
and the two poles, doubled up and splintered, about three-quarters
of the way up the drawing-room wall, where, on laying it open, we
found them firmly imbedded in the flue of the kitchen-chimney of
the adjoining house. This result we achieved after strenuous and
unremitting labour, by about twenty minutes past eleven, p.m.; but
as the Colonial Bishop, who says he feels "bad in his back," has been
summoned for trespass, and I shall have to make good sixty-seven
square feet of damaged brickwork before I have even a dining-room
chimney to sweep, I cannot with thorough confidence pronounce my
first attempt to do it without professional aid a perfect success.
Still, I would certainly not discourage the beginner, and say to him,
"Don't be your own Chimney-Sweep." On the contrary! I would
bid him try his 'prentice hand with a certain amount of boldness,
making the proviso, perhaps, that though somewhat contrary to his
true principles as an Amateur, he might find it to his advantage
possibly to pick up, as a preliminary, a second-hand professional
broom.

"DEFENCE, NOT DEFIANCE."
Sir,—The recent stirring events in the West End, when London,
for one evening, at least, was in the hands of the Mob, must fill.the
breast of every true Englishman with feelings of the greatest disgust
and indignation! The Police have been blamed, but are not the in-
habitants of this great City equally culpable? Why did not the
respectable classes rise in their hundreds, like one man, and challenge
the enemy? Like one man, I repeat—like me! Now, Sir, I will
tell you what I did on that ever memorable Monday, and let my
conduct prove an example, an admirable example, to everyone else.
I rose early, having received information that the Mob threatened
to sack the West End. My first care was to prove to the cowardly
ruffians that I was prepared for them. I hunted for a red shawl that
had once belonged to an aged relative, and then, with the addition of
a clothes-prop, that had been lying half-forgotten in the park-like
grounds of my back-yard, constructed a most admirable standard.
This I surmounted with a red woollen sailor's cap [en suite) that once
belonged to my youngest boy. Raising this imposing banner over the
portico of my hall-door, I impliedly defied the revolutionary hounds
to do their worst! Having completed this preliminary, my entire
domestic staff were set to work to pack up the whole of our valuables
(including the silver plate and some china), and convey them, in
triumph, to my banker's. "Now, you villains," I murmured, menac-
ingly, "come and take them—if you dare!"
By this time my noble sons—three children, with voices of an
angel—had learned at their brave mother's knee the tune of "The
Marseillaise," and were singing it out of the nursery window with
immense vigour! I thought, " If these dastards do come this way,
they shall nave a warm reception!" For a while all was quiet—
much to my disgust, as I wished to show my prowess—my power!
I was cursing the luck that seemed to seize from my lips—or rather
my breast—a oivil Victoria Cross, when a shout of " They're coming!"
told me that the time had at length arrived for action! Hastily
assuming the military garb of an ex-Militia man, prepared for
the worst, 1 hurried into a Hansom, and, in the twinkling of an eye,
was at the Wellington Barracks. I was well received by the Sentries on
duty, and even feebly recognised by the Officers at the School of In-
struction. Then I explained my plan to the Captain of the day. I
proposed that the whole regiment should turn out, and be sent to
the front!" And," I continued, "to prove with what rapid strides
Soienoe is progressing, I will lead them—through a Telephone—my-
self!" Will it be believed my proposal was declined! But I was
invited to remain at the Barracks—at my own suggestion.
The excitement grew, until at length I considered it necessary
to pay a visit of inspection to the cellars. So desirous was I to see
that they were in a proper state of defence, that I stayed in them for
hours, until one of the soldiers informed me that all danger was over,
and I need keep my weary watch no longer! It was then that I
determined to return home, feeling that the mob having dispersed,
London was safe from further invasion.
I retraoed my steps until I reached my hearth, which is at the same
address as my home. As I neared the door I heard the voices of my
children'still singing the " Marseillaise" and found the red flag
floating from the portico! I looked right and left, and finding I was
unnoticed, entered my hall. Drawing my sword, I declared that I
would execute marvels of valour before it again was sheathed, and
to fill up odd moments, began to toast crumpets on its sharpened
point. Night closed in, and we were Saved! Saved!! Saved!!!
Thus did I defend London a week ago! And what I could do
surely there are others who could do also!

Mr. Chamberlain declines to recognise Messrs. Hyndman, Burns,

and so become the cause of much bloodshed." Could jEsop have
been posted in Trafalgar Square on our latest Black Monday, he
would, in the three or four blatant Trumpeters of Sedition who
prated a mixed mob to passion-heat, and then discreetly withdrew
whilst that passion found vent in wrecking and ruffianism, have
seen the completest modern " application " of his old-world apologue.
They neither do nor can kill any man, these cowardly Catilines of
the gutter. Poor creatures, no! Their weapon is wind; they are
the bellows, not the flame—the trumpet, not the sword. Comfort-
ably broadcloth'd denouncers of middle-olass comfort, adequately
pence-provided railers against the wicked well-to-do, they counsel
robbery that they think will not touch their pockets, and suggest
the sheading of any blood but their own.
Represent the unemployed workers, indeed? Not they! They
represent fanatic hatred, and shallow conoeit. That is to say, they
represent themselves. Egotistical exoogitators of a brand-new social
scheme, they call upon poverty, which is blind, and ruffianism,
which is ruthless, to help them in bringing about the chaos which
they are pleased to consider an essential preliminary to their own
pet improvement upon Providenoe. "Principles are rained in
blood.''says the Poet Laureate, sorrowfully. And it is sadly true.
But these sanguinary egotists cry to Heaven for the red shower, to
make their own spindling little fads to flourish.
The cause of the poor in our days requires strenuous and unselfish
advocates. The terribly unequal distribution of the good things of
life, and the unjust social arrangements which help to bring it
about, demand the solicitous attention of the thinker and the philan-
thropist, the economist and the legislator. For these very reasons,
no good man will wish to see that advocacy in the hands of the
empirical firebrands of fanaticism, or that cause fought out at the
instigation of sophistry, and with the aid of ruffianism, in the streets.
That will only check sympathy, and put back practical improve-
ment. The sacking of struggling tradesmen's shops, in times, too,
when distress is by no means confined to the unemployed operatives,
is no step on the road to the righting of social wrongs, or the relief of
the suffering poor. Demonstrations that begin in a flood of incen-
diary olap-trap and end in an orgie of brutality, will do not good,
but h arm, to the honest wage-earners. That these are "exploited
by the Capitalist, the Monopolist, and the Middleman, is too true;
but that will not be avoided by their allowing themselves to be
exploited in another way by the spouting Sedition-monger and the
Official Self-seeker. Mr. Burns may orate, and Mr. Kenny may
"organise," but there is no help in them. The ory " To your tents,
0 Israel!" may one day have to be sounded, but not at the summons
of such as these.
Interrogated by interviewers, Messrs. Htndican & Co. are full of
sounding assumption, and of oracular swagger. ""We" contem-
plated this, and We" intend to do that. What they have done,
aided by disgraceful official negligence, is to give a few London
streets for a few hours over to the vilest and most violent form of
Mob-law. Of that achievement they possibly are proud. Verily they
ought to have their reward. Mr. Punch has pictorially suggested
what that reward should be, if they had their full deserts. Mr. Bitons
is of opinion that to hong Members of Parliament would be "to waste
good rone." Mr. Punch would feel, he admits, no such strained
scruple in Mr. Bubks'b own case. A gentleman who talks so glibly
of gallows and lamp-posts for the objects of his frothy enmity would
no doubt feel that he would honour the rope, rather than waste it.
Failing such payment in full, a fine of, say, £10,000, to be applied to
the relief of the prevailing distress, might approximately meet the

case, Mr. HnrDMAir and his friends being put to prison, with hard
labour, until they had fairly earned that sum, so that it might not
be said that they, at least, were amongst the unemployed.
Do they not deserve it? Dealing with an excitable mob, partly
composed of suffering toilers and partly of skulking scoundrels, blood
is on their lips, murder and cruel outrage at their hearts. Fools
they may be, but not such fools as to be unaware of the possible out-
come of such incitements addressed to such a multitude. "Work,
Bread, or Blood!" seems to be the motto of Mr. HvirpMAJf's choice.
He must have known that an appreciable portion of his audience did
not want either, but loot and licence. These he was prepared to give
them, at the expense of the innocent, in order to further his own
preposterous and impracticable schemes. To enlist the aid of the
predatory classes in the cause of Chaos, is a singular preliminary to
the Socialist Millennium. It would be a folly in the crassly ignorant:
in the intelligent or instructed it is an atrocious crime.
But whilst we denounce, and righteously denounce, this detestable
pact of fanaticism with ruffianism, let us not lose sight of, or sympa-
thy with, the real suffierers in these hardest of hard times. A
hundred thousand paupers in London! That terrible fact does not
need the sanguinary comments of the blatant Bubus to bring its
meaning home to the minds and hearts of wise and kindly men. The
prolonged and pitiful sufferings of the industrious toilers who are
really Out of Work," only themselves, their families, and the few
sympathisers who have an opportunity of intimate observation can
rightly appreciate. Poor souls! The majority of them would use
their last remnant of strength to kick such a firebrand as Burns out
of their half-stripped homes if he came talking violence and villainy
to them. So much the greater their claim upon our sympathy and
assistance. Much in the wav of wide-reaching reform and social
readjustment will have to be done in the interests of these ill-paid,
precariously-employed, but industrious workers and wage-earners
before their condition is made tolerable, and their remuneration
approximately just. But the duty of the hour is aid to the actually
suffering.
The shameful scenes of Monday should not slacken anyone's
sympathy, or shut anyone's purse-strings. Hyndhan & Co. did not
care though the innocent suffered for the guilty. If the Mansion
House or other Funds suffer from their fault, tee shall be sharing it.
The workless Working-Man all must compassionate, and all should
help, now by friendly aid, hereafter by well-considered reform. It
is the drunken, violent, un-Working-Man, the tool of sedition-
spouters, the ready ally of ruffianism, the danger to all classes, and
the disgrace of his own, whom Mr. Punch, speaking the sentiments
of all honest men, despises and denounces. It is amongst such as he
and such only, that self-styled "Representatives of the Unemployed,"
like Messrs. Htitdjian & Co., are likely to find recruits for their
Army of Anarchy. That Army had a field-day on Monday, and
gave a surprised City and a disgusted community a taste of its
quality. For that perhaps we may, after all, be thankful; for we
know now "with whom we have to deal." The Army must be
promptly disbanded, and its leaders—brave leaders, who lead from
the rear!—suspended, if not precisely in the manner pictured in the
cut, in one equally summary and decisive. And in the necessary
work of doing so Mr. Punch is persuaded that the first to " lend a
hand " would be those genuine, industrious, often hardly-used, but
honest and entirely unsanguinary wage-earners, whom the Arch-
Anarchists so stupidly traduce, and their ruffianly followers so
shamefully travesty.
TO WORKING-MEN.
Come all ye British Workmen who lead honourable lives,
And labour for the hearth and home, for children and for wives,
Repudiate the evil deeds late wrought by roughs and those
Who are the enemies of Law, and Order s bitter foes.
The sullen tramps who every form of occupation shirk,
The loafers who have never done a day of honest work;
The thieves who sneak down areas, the burglars armed to slay,
The doers of all kinds of wrong that shun the light of day.
Smug Hyttdman, in his broadcloth, urged such men to smash and'rob,
But wot we well his watch and chain were safe within his fob;
He egged curs on to outrages, to wage a social war,
Yet kept his own skin safe the while he cheered them from afar.
Such are no fit companions for honest folk and true,
Such are no real alhes, good friends, for Working-Men like you;
We know your hardships, and Heaven send you better days in store,
But down with those vile plunderers, and list such men no more.
Teach them that British Workmen hold the Law in due respect,
Teach them who robbed defenceless girls, you've strong arms to
protect;
Down with these Social Demoorats, let Workman lend a hand,
And sweep these thievish miscreants for ever from the land.

oontrarst, and witch tho' one for regret, is also one for proud rejoic-
ing. Can any one doubt that, if the gallient City Officials stood
their ground manfully to protect their own Lord Make and Marster
from insult and danger, that they wood have stood even much more
bolder, and much more gallanter to defend their own Ladt Mabess
and Missus? Why, suttenly not. Werry well—then now to my
tail of contrast.
Let my readers carst their eyes from Traffalger Square to Ide Park.
From the seen of glory to the seen of shame. What is it that I sees
in that arnt of Buty and Fashion? Can I bleeve my eyes? Tea, I
can, and I do, and what do them estenished and blushing eyes see?
A cowardly Mob a tacking defenseless butiful Ladies in carridges,
and the lordly Footmen with their gorgeous array, and their fatted
calves a running away faster probbably than they never run afore, a
leaving them as they was bound to pertect, and whose clothes they
was a wearing, and whose vittels they was accustomed to heat, four
full meals a day, besides hextras on hollydays, to the untender
mercies of a howun Mob! What a subjec for thortfool meddytashun!
The grand old Citty so cdicates its ofishals from the werry ighest
to the werry lowest, that they are always reddy at the caul of duty,
and ewen the humbel Footman defies the howling mob to move him
from the foot-board to witch he has attained by long ears of good
conduct and onest ambition, and meets their derysive shouts with
the paleness of shupreme contempt.
On the hother hand the aughty swells of the West End selects
their amost equally aughty Footmen for their hight, or their figger,
or their prowd demeaner, and so wen the hour of trial comes, the
hireling fleas becoz he is a hireling, and not traned in the parth of duty
by the traydishuns of the past and the haspirashuns of the future.
And as it is with Footmen so it is with Waiters. If you wants
respec from 'em you must show confidence in 'em, or when the time
of trial cums and you looks for currage from the fust or for dishcre-
tion, or ewen concealment, from the second, you will get instead of
ether. Running Footmen and Torking Waiters, and then how long
will life be wurth living? With armless Ladys left to their fate,
and open arted and open tongued gentlemen finding their most
secretest rewelations the common tork of their Clubs, the fashnable
world will begin to wish with a si that they had follered the good
example of the grand old Citty and by care, and kindness, and respec,
produced siteh a crop of bold Footmen and discreet Waiters as art
suttenly not to be matehed elsewhere* in this United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Wales. Robxk

FOREIGN NOTES OF A RECENT TRIAL.
To the Sedacteur in Chief of the "Gazette of Paris and the other Worlds."
Dear Colleague,
According to your direction, I presented myself for to
assist on Friday last, at the Royal Courts of Justice, to see how these
Insulars conduct their law-Bints. I wandered along the passages
until at last I found an angry crowd of Barristers divided into two
bodies — one in
front of a bar.
the other behind
it. They fought
like demons, and
all declared they
were "in the
case." It was a
'dreadful Bight!
I am told by one
of the janitors
that they were a
portion of ["the
Unemployed."
The janitor made
me the explana-
tion that as I was
Foreigner there
would be no
difficulty about
my gaining ad-
mittance, if I said
I was Ambassador. I followed the advice, and was at once allowed
to pass through the door into the Court. It was a wonderful sight,
that Court! The place had evidently been seized by a section of
"the Unemployed, for already the back benches were quite full of
white-wigged Advocates.
I heard from the gossip that flew about, that the case was a political
one, yet full to the tops of the fingers of domestic interest. Well,"
I said to myself, when I found from an Advocate the most obliging,
who said he was "taking a note." that the new Attorney-General
had for his colleague James-Sir-Henry, "why not engage your
friends?" And I was also not surprised to find from the same
Advocate so polite (who said he was M. Briefless) that Monsieur Joe
Chamberlain was there. "Is he not his friend?" I said, and
thought that friendship has to herself the claims. Suddenly there
was a crash, and the remainder of the Unemployed swept in! It was
a moment of danger! How they did rush in! These unfortunate
ones! Then the Judge entered, and bowed to the Bar, and, sitting
in his chair, regarded the Gallery—he too had friends, this magis-
trate the most distinguished. At this moment there was a murmur,
and the Turkish Ambassador was received. "Ah!" I to myself
did whisper, "the wily old fox! He has come to see how it will help
him with the Eastern Question!"
And then the moment arrived for them to commence. And now
judge of my surprise, my indignation, my astonishment! They put
the Jury in their box! Well, not much in this," you say— why
not the Jury?" I will tell you—I who speak will tell you—"why
not the Jury!"
"Who is he who they do put in the Jury-Box, as what you call—
is it not—the Foreman r" I asked of the Advocate the most energetic
beside me.
"That is Mr. Cyril Flower, Liberal Member of Parliament,"
returned Monsieur Briefless.
I opened my eyes, but said, "Well, it is a coincidence. It means
nothing! Monsieur Flower happens to be selected by a chance!"
But there came another surprise, another horror, another coincidence
—bah! coincidence I Monsieur Joe Chamberlain, Member of the
Cabinet, was put into the Jury-Box! You hear, to give such a
verdict they put Monsieur Joe Chamberlain in the Jury-Box!
It is true that Monsieur Joe Chamberlain looked very dignified,
very horrified, very surprised, at some things he heard. But ought he
to have been there? Oh, shocking!
And Monsieur Flower! Ah! that [Monsieur Flower! Once' he
said something to Monsieur Joe Chamberlain, and " Mr. Russell,"
(as the Attorney-General was addressed by that " Devil," Monsieur
Wright—Monsieur Briefless told mo Monsieur Wright was a
"Devil." Ah! appearances they are deceitful!) shook his finger at
him, and was very angry! And why was he angry? Because
Monsieur Flower was saying "chats (word English) to Monsieur
Chamberlain when a witness was being cross-examined! Ah,
"Mr. Attorney" is very fair! Very good! But there is more!
Ah, another Juryman! Can I believe my eyes? Am I not head-
mounted? The Turkish Ambassador! Yes, ha too—this gloomy one
—was to help! A verdict from that trio! It was too much!
England is coerced! England has no liberty! Albion is perfidious
indeed! So I rushed away—I waited not for the decision. That
you already know. It has come to you by "telegraph. And what js<i
it P A paradox! And what else could one expect from such" a
"Jury." Listen! Cyril, Joe, the Turkish Ambassador! Bah!
Accept the assurances of my greatest consideration,
{Signed) Jules Canard.
1267, Vauxhall Bridge Road, South Belgravia.
P.S.—I am told that the trial I saw was heard without a Jury!
How can this be, when I toll you—I who speaks—I saw them, Cyril,
Joe, and the Turk, with my own eyes, in the Jury-Box! It is a
subterfuge, what they call a "bang-cracker-bang!" Oh, shocking!
YEO HO!
As last week we recommended the perusal of Dr. Roose's Wear
and Tear of London—the Roose in Urbe article in the Fortnightly,
so now we have to thank Dr. Burnet Yeo for his consolatory essay
on " Food Accessories," in the Nineteenth Century for this month.
"Food Accessories," though including accidentally pickles, may
be taken in a general way as a synonym for "drinks of all sorts,
and it is delightful to know that Dr. Yeo's observations may be
summed up in this golden rule—"Drink whatever you like and
whenever you like it, as long as from experience you have found out
that it, whatever it may be, agrees with you."
Dr. BuRNEY Yeo's prescription agrees with us, and we agree with
Dr. Yeo.
I like you, Dr. Burney Yeo,
The reason why I '11 let you know.
A good example do you show,
That's why I like you, Burney Yeo.
"Food Accessories" is so much more elegant, as a term, than
"drink," that we hope it will soon be brought into popular use.
"Will you take some Food Accessory? Give it a name. Another
bottle of '74 Food Accessory, if you please. Now, Gentlemen,
bumpers!"
Champagne drinkers and champagne firms too ought to be grateful
to Dr. Burney Yeo, who gives it a distinct superiority over other
wines in accelerating digestion. Pommery and Greno should send
him a medal. Then it is absolutely a restorative in itself to be told
on such authority that "small quantities of claret, hock, and even
of sherry, act as pure stimulants." Bravo! Also "a moderate
quantity of light beer, when 'well up,' is favourable to stomach
digestion." Let it be clear, amber-coloured, decanted Bass; let it
be well up and then well down. The learned Doctor is rather down
on tea, but the small cup of black coffee immediately after dinner is
harmless if not too strong.
Dr. Yeo utterly dissipates the idea which possesses some timid
drinkers that effervescent table-waters, taken during dinner, are good
for digestion. He says, "they exercise a considerable retarding
influence,"—and certainly the practice is cheerless and unsociable,
and now that there is such an authority against it, let us hope it
will be banished from the tables of all whose "food accessories"
would be insulted by being so "craftily qualified." Once more,
thanks to Burney Tceo—a name, by the way, which is strictly
English, and yet looks uncommonly like that of a Chinese Philo-
sopher.
BEER VERSUS WATER.
When the men who supply us with adulterated beer fall out with
the men who provide us with impure water, the British consumer
may perhaps expect to "hear something to his advantage," in due
time. The other day a deputation from the Licensed Victuallers of
Walworth waited on Mr. Blron, Q.C., the Police Court Magistrate of
Lambeth, complaining of unjust extra oharges made upon them by
the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company. Mr. Blron intimated
his opinion that the Witlers, not the Water Men, were in the right,
but said that opinion was not binding. Only a " pious opinion'' in
fact. He advised them to send a deputation to the Company! We
do not know whether the Witlers took as their motto "Creole Biron."
Mr. Punch would suggest that the two parties in this pretty and
promising quarrel should refer it for settlement to the arbitration of
Sir Wilfrid Lawson and Sir. Archibald Dobbs.
"At a time like the present," said the Daily Newt last Thursday,
"the one thing which the Authorities must do is to keep their heads.
But if the Heads are so useless as they evidently were on Monday
the 8th, the sooner they are lost the better. Any change in the
Heads must surely be for the publio benefit. The Chief Head gets
£2100 per annum. A valuable specimen of a Constable this ought
to be.
The " Labour" for the "Unemployed Rioters "—Hard, and three
months of it.

"A RADICAL SNOB."
What did W. M. Thackeray say about
him, which you will find in Contributions to
Punch, lately reprinted in one Volume by
Messrs. Smith and Elder? Says he:—
"Perhaps, after all, there is no better friend to
Conservatism than your outrageous Radical Snob.
When a man preaches to you that all Noblemen
are tyrants, that all Clergymen are hypocrites and
liars, that all Capitalists are scoundrels, banded
together in an infamous conspiracy to deprive the
people of their rights, he creates a wholesome re-
vulsion of feeling in favour of the abused parties,
and a sense of fair play leads the generous heart to
take a side with the object of unjust oppression.
"The frantic dwarf becomes a most
wicked and dangerous Snob when he gets the ear
of people more ignorant than himself, inflames
them with lies, and misleads them into ruin."
This was in 1846—just forty years ago—
and, with some slight modification, necessi-
tated by changed circumstances, what the
author of the Snob Papers said of Young
Ireland then will be found pretty true of
some of Ould Ireland's Patriots in this Year
of Grace—may it never be of dis-grace—1886.

ing shimmers in its employ!—commenced his
last Friday's Article thus:—"Donning my
special night-slumming costume (which is
neither evening nor Court dress ")—here he is
wrong; surely the costume ought to be a Court
dress—a very low Court dress, also suitable
for an Alley—the Special so attired might adopt
the signature of Alley Sltjmmer—with apolo-
gies to Mr. A. Slofer, whose gift of a Testi-
monial Picture we have not had till now any
opportunity of acknowledging. The plucky
Gentleman who does the Shimming has, we
should imagine, to take a considerable amount
of bad drink in the course of the evening,
though he only mentions two —a pint of ale,
and a cup of tea. At all events it is evident
that" One Swallow doesn't make a Shimmer.

SOMETHING LIKE A DRAMA!
Being unable to attend a performance of the Galley Slave, I sent
my youthful assistant, " Tommy the Tester" to the Grand Theatre,
Islington, to represent me. The Child-critic reports that he didn't
know why such a name should have been selected for the piece,
as there was nothing in the story to suggest"it. "But," he
adds, "perhaps it was because all the actors were American, though
they spoke English very well, considering." He came in time for
the end of the Prologue, and found, he says, a Lady and Gentleman
kissing one another. Then a crowd came in and cheered them,
bringing with them a little girl, in a Venice dress, all sorts of colours.
Then the kissing Gentleman kissed the little girl, and the kissing
Lady said, quite angrily, " How dare you? I am jealous of a child!
Then she tumbled on her knees and said, gravely. " Poor little thing,
forgive me?" and then " the Curtain felldown.
The next Scene was laid in Rome, where a Gentleman in an Eve-
glass was sitting abusing the ceiling. Upon this Gentleman called
a yery wicked person, who was, like the "Demon of Mischief" in
the Pantomime, with long hair, and an Astrachan coat. He told the
Gentleman in the Eyeglass that, wishing to marry a Lady (that
"Tommy the Tester subsequently distinguished as the "Golden
Girl"), he had " dismissed his wife and child," and thus become a
Baronet. Before this promotion, he had been only a Painter; and,
said Tommy, in explanation, "You know it was a very low thing
indeed to be an Artist in Rome." All this the naughty Baronet
told the Person in the Eye-glass, "on his oath and word and honour
of a Gentleman," that it should go no further—a pledge given on
the condition that the story should not turn out to be "fishy."
Then a beautiful Lady, all covered with jewels, came in, and
gave a Gentleman in a Curly Wig, her card, set in diamonds. But
the Curly-wigged Gentleman was soon displaced by the Demon in the
Pantomime, who drove him away, and kissed the Golden Girl'' because
he liked her so much." And as he was'thus embracing her, his first
wife and child (who it will be remembered he had " dismissed"), who
"had bean looking for him for years," put their heads in, and saw
it. And then there was a row, and the Golden Girl went into
hysterics, and the Curtain fell down.
In the Second Act the Golden Girl had married the Naughty
THE POET TO HIS QUARTERLY ALLOWANCE.
By the Author of "Mine to-day," "How long will it last?"
"How will it be?" " What do you think f " 4sc, <Lc.
(With Apologies to May Probyn- and Isidore de Lara.)
Come what will, you are mine to-day,
At any rate till you 've been paid away,
But you 're most of you owing, I'm sorry to say,
And now will it be when I've spent you, eh?
Where shall I hide when the tradesmen call?
How shall I ever appease them all?
You are mine to-day! But I won't talk tall,
For how will it be when I have to sing small?
You are mine to-day (as is too well known),
To chink and to rattle and call my own,
But how will it be when the duns come down,
And / have come down—to my last half-crown?
You are mine to-day, in convenient form,
You '11 do, for the present, to stay the storm:
But how will it be when creditors swarm?
And what shall I do if they make it warm?
You are mine to-day, whatever befall—
Though duns for their settlements shout and bawl—
I have got a back-door, if the tradesmen call;
There's "my Uncle" still, when I've lost my all.
Ibbational and Anti-National.—At Morley Hall,
Hackney, there was a row. Someone played " God Save
the Queen," on the organ, and this loyal strain was too
much for the Republicans (with whom on no account must
we confuse the; publicans), who struck up " The Marseil-
laise." This came out in evidence, in the assault case before
Mr. Hannay, who gave the unsocial democrat fourteen
days with hard labour, and without the option of a fine, a
sentence which we hope would have been pronounced by
Hannay other Magistrate in a similar case. But for Eng-
lishmen to take to singing " The Marseillaise "—bah! it's
disgusting—we don't want to "adapt" our communism
'' from the French."
Baronet, but why she had done it the Tester oould not make out, "as
she loved some one else, and he had another wife, unless it was that
he said he was so fond of her." And the Curly-wigged Gentleman
called, and was "mistook," and by order of the Demon taken off to
prison, upon which the Golden Girl fainted again, but this time fell
on her face.
The next Act was theprison where were the " Dismissed " Wife, the
Golden Girl, and the Curly-wigged Gentleman. And the prisoners
were all in cells, the men being on one side, and, as the Tester said,
"the Ladies on the other." Then they were all rescued, and went
into hysterics. In the last Act the Golden Girl was kissing the
Curly-wigged Gentleman, when the Wicked Baronet said ' they
oughtn't. But the curly-wigged one " said they ought." Then the
Wicked Baronet said he hadn't married his " Dismissed" Wife, but it
was proved that he had by a document brought by some people from
behind a screen. Then the Gentleman in the Eye-glass, who hadn't
been seen since the first Act, came on, and said that he would tell
the whole story, as he now thought it "fishy." Then everybody said
the Wicked Baronet ought to be sent to prison for seven years, and
then the Curtain fell down. This is the plot of the Galley Slave, as
communicated by " Tommy the Tester," which would, no doubt, have
been clearer had he been a little older. Squibbler.

Old Saw Re-set.—Mr. Hyndman in ordinary life is lamb-like.
He has rather a soft and pleasant voice, with which the Rough is

modern instance of the old saw, which evidently Mr. Hyndman
adopts as hie motte: "Yen mutt take the Raugh with the Smoeth."

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Monday, Feb. lhth.—Had a good week's rest. Very pleasant way
of approaching business. Some people say it's a waste of time that
Ministers should have to be re-elected. I say not. Gives us, on the
whole, nearly a fortnight's holiday. Plenty of time to work later on.
Also gives me opportunity of thinking over Irish Question, and
finally settling it.
Great point of controversy is whether Ireland shall have Parlia-
ment of its own on College Green. Some say. Yes. More say, No.
I say, let us take new view of the situation. What did Mahomet do
when the Mountain wouldn't come to him? He went to the Moun-
tain. Very well. There are difficulties about a section of Imperial
Parliament setting up independently in business in Dublin. "No
separation !" is the unanimous cry.
We '11 not separate. We 'U all go over to Dublin.'
Pleasant change; new sensation; Saturday to Monday excursions
to Killarney; pic-nic on the Giant's Causeway; eight hours at the
seaside where the Atlantic breaks upon the rugged coast of Galway.
Besides, such larks in the House! In my mind s eye I see us dis-
cussingquestion, "That Clause Three bo added to the Bill." Got
friend Fubniss to draw it. Seems to be some difference of opinion
expressed in various parts of the House, but quite used to that at
Westminster. More picturesquely expressed at College Green.
Hope this idea won t be lost sight of. Seems to me to clear up
situation, and avoids all complications in connection with the
"fundamental law."
AN URGENT APPEAL.
Mb. Punch is of opinion that the Books most necessary for a
"Liberal" education are, at the present moment, the Cheque-books
of the Well-to-do. If one hundred of these books are at once
opened, a thumping cheque drawn in each, and the same sent, with-
out delay, to the Mansion House Fund in aid of the Unemployed, a
good example will be set, which may help to teach liberality to our
illiberal rich, and remove the disgrace of that Fund's standing at so
low a figure after so needful an appeal in times so pitifully hard.
What are a few thousands among the helpless hosts of the Unem-
ployed? What, we may add, are a few thousands to that other
host of the Unemployed, the opulent idlers of Society, who could
spare, without missing it, from their superfluity, what would save
the first host from lack of the commonest necessities of existence.
At present, hundreds of thousands of usually hard-working poor
folk "toil not, neither do they spin," simply because they can find
no spinning to do, and.nothing to toil at. But their abstention from
toiling ana spinning, unlike that of the curled darlings of civilisa-
tion, means misery, semi-starvation, tireless grates, empty cupboards,
pawned belongings, sickness, and sometimes premature death. They
are not as the lilies of the field, rather as the sickly, spindling, pot
flowers of the slums.
Consider them, nevertheless, ye opulent, revelling in the wealth a
large proportion of which is drawn originally from the labour of
those now unwillingly idle hands. Consider their sorrowful case,
and voluntarily trim just a little bit that ill-poised balance of the
distribution of wealth which reform will one day have to redress,
. and which, if you do not take heed in time, Revolution may yet essay
I in grim earnest the stern and terrible righting of. Do not let alarm
or anger at Monday's sputter of street-sedition and gutter-ruffianism
deter you from recognition of a real evil, or relief of a wide-spreading
woe. That would be unworthy of common wisdom, and disgraceful
to ordinary good feeling, a folly to be expiated hereafter, an unkind-
ness to he remembered with shame and confusion of face. Out with
your cheque-books, Gentlemen! Remember we have to teach the
foreign scribes, who are busy mocking us for having the red revolu-
tion at last in our midst, and being helplessly scared thereat; we
have to teach those sardonic persons that, though caught napping
for once, owing to the neglect of trusted officialism, we can bounti-
fully help our really suffering fellow-countrymen, while putting
down with a firm hand the firebrand fanatics who would urge them
in their hunger to wild and wicked courses. Verbum sap.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE "CRAVEN" HUNT.
Fancy Sketch by Our Great Sporting Artist, B. Crambo, Esq., Junior.
"WHAT BOYS READ."
In the current number of the Fortnightly, under the above title,
Mr. G. Salmon has, in a carefully-written article, endeavoured to
deal with the subject of the literary provision made by modern
writers for the rising generation, and, in taking a general survey of
the question, has indulged in some thoroughly sound if not particu-
larly original moral reflections. Quoting Pelham's friend, Vincent^ he
says: "Do not put fiction into the hands of a child with no principle
to guide him. First fortify his intellect by reason, and you may
then please his fancy by fiction. Do not excite his fancy with love
and glory till you instruct his judgment what love and glory are.
Teach him, in short, to reflect before you permit him full indulgence
to imagine." Now, this has the ring of very excellent advice, of course,
though there would appear to be considerable difficulty in giving .it
any practical shape. To fortify the intellect of the young by reason
until it is capable of exercising judgment and discrimination in the
selection of fiction, seems not only to be making exhaustive demands
on the supervising capacities or the parent or guardian, but, in a
sense, to be putting the moral cart before the horse. For the reflec-
tive process is the outcome of the imaginative. And so it comes
back to this, that all depends on the character of the fiction that is
supplied to the young idea when in the process of shooting. And
here Mr. Salmon shows himself by no means a fish out of water,
for he is ready with a hopeful and encouraging catalogue. From
Robinson Crusoe and Tom Brown's School-days down through
Mr. Kingston's delightful adventures and those of Mr. Ballantyne
and Mr. G. A. Hentt, to the capital Stories of Mr. Henry Firth,
Dr. Gordon Stables, and Mr. T. C. Hutchison, not omitting Mr.
Adams, and Mr. Reed who has figured so prominently in the Boys'
Oxen Paper, there is a regular fund of wholesome literature for
British Youth to draw upon; and as Mr. Salmon truly remarks,
"thus far all has been bright and healthy."
But on turning from boys' books to boys' journals, the prospect
entirely changes. Mr. Salmon continues:—
"Morally, it is the change from life to death. The majority of the perio-
dicals which are supplied to the children of the working classes are devoid of
every clement of sweetness and light. They are filled with stories of blood
and revenge, of passion and cruelty, as improbable and almost impossible in
plot, as they are contemptible in literary execution."
This is not overstating the case. Indeed it is scarcely possible to
exaggerate the nauseous quality of the trash that is prepared, in the
shape of penny numbers, for the reading of hundreds of thousands of
the British young of both sexes. If proof of the wide-spread
charaoter of the evil is demanded, there are the daily records of the
nearest Police Courts ready with the answer. The Boy Pirate and
the Boy Brigand of fiction soon becomes the boy burglar and the
boy thief of fact, and the literature which takes its heroes from the
Newgate Calendar is fruitful in its supply of candidates for the gaol
and the Reformatory.
Casting about for a remedy, the scared writer of the Article in
the Fortnightly suggests a Press Censorship, pertinently asking the
question whether there is "any greater harm in writing and pub-
lishing a libel than in writing and publishing a work calculated
irretrievably to injure the minds of those who read it?" The diffi-
culty, of course, would be, where to draw the line. What amount
of vice or moral obliquity in the hero would be sufficient in the
Censor's eye to render the suppression of his adventures desirable?
Would the details of The Cruise of a Boy Brigand in the Adriatic,
accompanied by a couple of captive jewelled princesses, be enough?
Would tho mere history of a hang-dog Pirate's experiences, without
any material expression of sympathy with bis views, justify an
interference with the Publisher? The solution of the matter is by
no means easy. Yet, as the writer points out, no greater responsibility
would attach to a suppression of this kind than attaches to the
placing by the Lord Chamberlain of his veto on a play which ho
considered unfit for production on the English Stage.
Alnsworth's story may serve the turn of an Opera-bouffe Libret-
tist, and the scamp himself be played by a sprightly actress without
much harm being done to anybody. Jack Sheppard, for instance,
ought not to be sanctioned by the Licenser anymore than Claude Duval,
Dick Turpin, or any other drama of a like kind, of which the
recognised motive is the veiled incentive to crime. Still, a raid on
Harrison Ainsworth, notwithstanding the acknowledged mischief
that has been done to the young and ignorant by a perusal of his
cracksman's romance, would scarcely be the same thing, and yet the
cases are sufficiently parallel to admit at least of argument. We
should be inclined to suppress such romances as Jack Sheppard,
Rookwood, Bulwer's Claude Duval, and also Eugene Aram, which
was so severely and so justly satirised by Thackeray in Mr. Punch's
pages. For the truth about Jack Sheppard our readers have only
to refer to one of the earliest volumes of Mr. Punch's series, where
they will find his character as described by Ainsworth, and his
true character as given in the Newgate Calendar, displayed side by
side in parallel columns. There was no sort of romance about the real
John Sheppard.
Meantime, for want of a better remedy to meet the evil, let parents
and guardians, and those who have charge and direction of the young
idea, keep their eyes open and have a special regard to the direction
in which it shows inclination to shoot. It is just as ready to derive
its nutriment from the "penny healthful," as from the "penny
dreadful," and as a mere matter of commercial enterprise, the former
could be as easily forthcoming and available as the latter. Philan-
thropy is continually actively busying itself about the education of
the young-yhere is something practical for it to do—let it look to the
quality of its Magazine literature. It wants some energy and some
capital, but both in these days ought to be forthcoming. To drive
the penny dreadful out of the literary field is not a task beyond the
powers of organisation and enterprise. And it is in thk direction
that the first steps will be taken in the material and moral ameliora-
tion of " What boys read." The Fortnightly is to be congratulated
on the best Salmon that has been served up this year.
Mrs. Westlake and Mr. Buxton managed between them at the
last meeting of the London School Board, to keep the reactionary ball
well rolling, and 'made it pretty plain that Mr. Hughes, with his
resolutions, and Sir Richard Temple, with his financial statement,
were by no means going to have the game as easily their own way as
they had imagined. What the upshot will be it is not, however, easy
to determine. It may bo remarked that a good deal of acrimony
appears to have been manifested in the course of tho debate, due
possibly to the injudicious conduct of a deputation that attended at
the commencement of the proceedings, from St. John's Wood. This
deputation appears, according to the report, to have been " somewhat
noisy," cheering the speakers who sympathised with the object of
their mission, but hissing and "making adverse noises when members
expressed antagonistic views." Indeed, so far did they throw them-
selves into their cause, that it was proposed that " they should be
requested to- retire," and severe comments were passed upon their
conduct, that was unfavourably contrasted with the conduct of
Working-Men, who had previously attended the Board. Upon receiv-
ing this snub, the hilarious deputation withdrew, but as they had
been on the side of the Economists, the incident, which must have
left an unpleasant feeling, was not without its effect on the subse-
quent course of the proceedings, which ultimately resulted in an
adjournment.
It is to be hoped that the reply of Mr. Edmund Hay Currtk,
Chairman of the Trustees of the People's Palace, to Canon Wilber-
force's inquiry as to whether it is proposed to apply for a drinking-
licence for the Institution when organised and hnisbed, will dispose
ot the matter for good and for all, for nothing could be more fatal to
the undertaking than any attempt to put it into leading-strings,
though they be manufactured of the finest of blue ribbon. The idea
that the British Working-Man, for whose benefit and recreation the
East-End Palace has been conceived, is everlastingly in need of moral
coddling, is quite erroneous, and any concession to it in connection
with such an enterprise as that entertained by the Beaumont
Trustees, would be disastrous to the whole scheme. That the people
who patronise the Palace will soon learn to be temperate within its
walls, Canon Wilberforce may be pretty well sure; and his attempt,
literally, to throw cold water on the undertaking in this its initiatory
stage is a great mistake. The classes for whose benefit it is intended
are not in need of goody-goody legislation, but it is possible they
would like to call for a glass of beer. And they ought to have it
when they do.

Fragments from a forthcoming "No Popery" Novel adapted from
Dickens to the present day.
hut up, Simon Tappebtit!"
saiaJoHN Bull. "Yon
needn't make any more of
that confounded clatter.
"Your blows produce more
row than anything else."
"Sir," said Sim, with
an air of inflated self-
importance highly ludi-
crous to behold, " a blow
will have to be struck—
and a blow will be struck
—the sound of which will
go into all lands, and the
echoes of which shall
reverberate to the utter-
most corners of the
earth."
"I suppose." muttered
John, "that s out of the
Patriot's Garland, or the
Patriot's Delight, or the
Patriot's Windbag, or the
Patriot'« Guide to Balder-
dash} or some such im-
proving text-book."
Simon Tappertit was
a thin-faced, sleek-haired,
cock-nosed, large-eyed
little fellow, smart but small, yet persuaded in his own mind
that he was "as big as Benjamin, as he figuratively phrased
it. He also had some majestic, shadowy ideas, which had never
been quite fathomed by his intimate friends. It may be inferred
from these premises that in the small body of Mr. Tappebtit there
was locked up an ambitious and aspiring soul. As certain liquors
confined in casks too cramped in their dimensions, will ferment, and
fret, and chafe in their imprisonment, so the spiritual essence or soul
of Mr. Tappebtit would sometimes fume within that precious cask,
his body, until, with great foam and froth and splutter, it would
force a vent, and carry all before it. He had a mighty notion of his
party—which was Blue—and his sect—which was deep Orange—and
was reported to have said that in former times a stigma had been cast
on these colours by the extension of a right to flaunt to their
antagonists Buff and—especially—Green. This stigma, he held, was
one to which the B.'s and O.'s should not have basely submitted, but
should have demanded its removal of the legislature, temperately at
first, then by an appeal to arms if necessary. Indeed, he would
darkly, and to the terror of his hearers, hint at certain reckless
fellows that he knew of, and a certain Lion Heart ready to become
their Captain, who onoe afoot would make the Pope himself tremble
on bis throne.
• •••»•
Regarding the pause which ensued as a particularly advantageous
opportunity for doing great execution, Mr. Tappertit began to
screw and twist his face into such extraordinary, hideous, and un-
paralleled contortions that John, who happened to be looking towards
him .was stricken with amazement.
"Why. what the devil's the matter with the lad P" cried his
master, ''he's choking!"
"Who? " demanded Sim, with some disdain.
"Who? Why. you!" returned his master. "What do you
mean by making those horrible faces?"
"Faces are a matter of taste, Sir," said Mr. Tappebtit.
"Sim," rejoined John, laughing heartily, "don't be a fool, for I'd
rather see you in your senses."
"I '11 do nothing, to-day," said Mr. Tappebtit, dashing down his
'prentice cap, "but grind—I'll grind up all the tools. Grinding
will suit my present humour! Joe!!!" This last monosyllable was
uttered with singular significance, and supreme contempt.
Whirr-r-r-r! The grindstone was soon in motion—the sparks
were flying off in showers. This was the occupation for his heated
spirit.
"Job!!!"
Whirr-r-r-r-r-r!
"Something will come of this!" said Mr. Tappebtit, pausing, as
if in triumph. "Something will come of this. I hope it mayn't be
human gore!"
Whirr-r-r-r-r-r-r!
Mr. TAPPEBTrr, Chief or Captain of the United Bulldogs, a
violently Blue-cum-Orange Association of bold and daring spirits,
aspired to a distinguished state in great political events. Hence his
connection with that great Protestant and Loyalist Association. His
Protestantism was illustrated by vehement protestations against any
diminution—even in the interests of justice—of the Blue-and-Orange
Ererogatives as "a dominant and an imperial caste ;" his loyalism
v the utterance of scarcely veiled incitement to rebellion and Civil
War. Mr. Tappebtit's talk in this connection was simply tre-
mendous. He took to the Tub, and harangued the multitude—
at Paddington—in the true Tyrtaeus-cum-Boanerges style.
"Tappebtit is an earnest man," remarked one startled Padding-
tonian.
"One of the foremost among them all," rejoined another. "He
snuffs the battle from afar, like the war-horse. He throws his hat
up in the streets, as if he were inspired, and makes most stirring
speeches from the shoulders of his friends."
"Make a note of Tappebtit," muttered a more thoughtful ob-
server, dubiously. "He may be advanced to a place of trust. Let
us see how far he shows himself fitted for it."
"Hear, hear! Bravo!! Shows great courage on your part!!!"
yelled the multitude, greatly stirred Dy Simon's sounding tropes and
valiant invective.
All these compliments Mr. Tappebtit received as matters of
course—flattering enough in their way, but entirely attributable to
his vast superiority. Mr. Tappebtit had mounted on an empty
cask, which stood by way of rostrum in the room, and volunteered a
speech upon the alarming crisis at hand.
"I go?' said he,"
to stir our fellow-Protestants to pious violence,
to rouse our fellow-Loyalists to revolt. I go to bear from Protestant
Paddington to Presbyterian Belfast the Fiery Cross of religious and
racial rivalry, which the insanity engendered by a monstrous and
unparalleled combination of verbosity and senility has long been
vainly striving to extinguish."
"Hooray! Keep it blazing, Simon !" shouted the excited throng.
"The time has come for the blow! I go to strike it!" shrieked
Tappebtit.
"Good night, Captain," they cried. "We 're yours to the death,
remember!
"Farewell!" said Mr. Tappebtit, waving his hand. "Be bold
and vigilant!"
"No Popery, Captain !" roared they.
"Ireland in blood first.'" cried their desperate leader, whereat the
Mob cheered and laughed and dispersed.
* * • • * •
The result of Mr. Tappebtit's incendiary enterprise remains to be
seen. Sensible men shake their heads over the prospect of a firebrand
among powder-casks.
THE PHOTOGRAPHIC HAT.
[Herr Luders, of GSrlitz, has patented a photographic hat, which carries
a camera, lens, and dry plates, the latter being exposed by pulling a string,
when negatives are taken at the will of the wearer.]
If they knew what I wear when I walk in the street,
I should be quite a terror to people I meet;
They would ny when they saw me, and ne'er stop to chat,
For I carry a camera up in my hat.
A Herr Luders, of Gorlitz, has patented this,
And I think the idea is by no means amiss;
With a hole in my hat for the lens to peep through,
And a dry plate behind, I take portrait or view.
Should I meet, when I chance to be taking the air,
With a lady who looks so surpassingly fair,
If I wish to preserve her sweet face by the sun,
Why I just pull a string, and the photograph's done.
I admire, say, a sea-scape, or else chance to look,
With the eye of an artist, on picturesque nook;
There are plates in my hat, it I poise it with skill,
That will take any beautiful view at my will.
If I'm stopped in the street—that may happen, you know—
By a robber whose manners are not comme ilfaut,
His identification should never be hard,
There's my neat little photograph in Scotland Yard.
So we '11 all wear the hat made by Science complete,
With a camera, lens, and a dry-plate en suite;
And take views in the street with its bustle and traffic,
By the aid of this German's strange hat photographic.

days under water, and were running short of ozonised
air. He gasped as he gazed out into the dark wilder-
ness that surrounded them, and could make nothing
out.
"I think, Sir," he said, creeping slowly hack again,
and addressing the Admiral, who was now rubbing his
head, "that we must be passing through a shoal of
mackerel. But," he added, drily, if you nave any com-
munication to make to the Fleet, no doubt we should be
able to find it for you, with the Electric Shrimp Torpedo;
we should then possibly discover some means of delivering
your message."
The Admiral was still rubbing his head, but he in-
stantly rejoined,—
"A happy thought, Mr. Flag-Lieutenant. Let the
Electric Shrimp Torpedo be manned; and if thev come
across one of the enemy's ships, they can go at it.
"Ay! ay! Sir," responded the Flag-Lieutenant.
The order was no sooner given than it was carried into
effect. In a few minutes the three volunteers, who not
very cheerfully came forward for the work, were packed
tightly in the recesses of the diminutive but formidable
little engine, and it was launched forthwith on its erratic
course through the side of the submarine iron-clad by
a discharge of dynamite. It darted off at lightning speed
in quarter of a mile shoots, illuminating the dense water
in every direction as it advanced. The receding wire
paid out from the delicate instrument on the Admiral's
table jerked at times ominously. It was clear that the
Electric Shrimp Torpedo was all over the place. After a
short interval there was a shout through the self-acting
telephone. The Admiral was all attention.
"We have come up with a portion of the British Fleet,
entangled in a bed of seaweed," continued the voice.
"What is the order of the day?"
"England expects every man to do his duty," was
the tentative reply. "I think," continued the Admiral,
addressing the Flag-Lieutenant, "that they mayn't
have heard that before. It ought to inspirit 'em. And
now, if you please, we will follow up the course of the
Electric Shrimp Torpedo, and prepare for action."
No sooner was the order given than all was activity
within the confined space of the ingeniously constructed
craft. The fore, aft and side-screws began to revolve
rapidly as the deck slowly lowered to within two feet
of the cabin floor. The Admiral was lying on his face
now, under the cuddy table. He could not sit up. But he
had put on his cork leggings, life-buoy tunic, and floating
cocked hat, and with the telephone in one hand, and a fog-
horn in the other, was ready for the fray. The Flag-Lieu-
tenant drew himself along on his knees, and resumed his
position in the projecting glass bull's-eye. The men loaded
the guns, and then themselves got inside the breeches to
economise the room. They would have cheered, but at
this depth,—they knew they were in ninety-two fathoms
of water,—they felt it would be of no use. Still, the
submarine craft sped swiftly on its way. The Flag-
Lieutenant peered hopelessly, through the projecting
glass bull's-eye, into the impenetrable gloom without. At
one moment he thought he distinguished an enemy's ship
approaching. But he was mistaken. It was merely a
porpoise in hysterics. The Admiral referred to the tele-
phone, but could get no reply. Something had happened
to the Electric Shrimp Torpedo. The situation was
awkward. The Admiral felt the responsibility. He
counted the minutes on his chronometer.
Suddenly the silence was broken by a weak shout.
"Look out!" cried the Flag-Lieutenant. "I see lights.
"We are. I think, in the midst of the enemy's fleet."
The Admiral sounded his fog-horn. "Hooray! Give
it them hot. boys!" he responded. "Fire!"
But at that moment, with a tremendous crash, the
craft parted amidships, and blew up with a terrific explo-
sion, in two fragments. The Electric Shrimp Torpedo
had gone right through them. In another minute the
liberated Admiral, borne upwards by his buoyant suit,
was rising rapidly to the surface of the water.
"This comes of fighting under the sea," he grumbled,
shaking the sea-weed out of his hair as his head emerged
on the calm, smiling, yacht-dotted horizon above. "But
I might have known what it would be. I have been
blown up by my own orders I"

"UP A TREE!"
Sib,—The East Kent Foxhounds, who are seemingly worthy rivals to those
famous old sea-dogs, the Thanet Harriers, had a good time of it the other day,.
After, no doubt, beating the Dover Bathing-Machine coverts, and, as might be
expected at this inclement season of the year, drawing blank, the experienced
Whip of the pleasant party discovered three foxes seated in a tree. Accustomed
to the athletic exercises so necessary an adjunct to the office he holds in the
eccentric Hunt to which he belongs, the Whip "swarmed" the tree, and succeeded
in dislodging a fox, who gave the pack a "good ringing run" over the sands,
apparently being lost ultimately in an unused receptacle for bath-towels.
Delighted with their unusual sport (as foxes at Folkestone have not of late years
been too plentiful) the Hunt promptly returned to the tree, and the Whip having
again swarmed it, another fox was dislodged. Unhappily, before Reynard could
recover from his fall and regain his feet, he was "run in and chopped," no doubt
by some honorary member of the pack—say a sporting sheep-dog or an enterprising
colley. As the oak had proved so productive, and the Hunt could think of no
other covert (the Thanet Harriers being no doubt jealous of any interference with
their Margate and Heme Bay line of country), the Whip was once more urged
to " swarm" the tree. Again a fox was unwooded; and this time the pack having
been seemingly muzzled until Master Reynard had had time to "go away," a fine
spin of a quarter-of-an-hour, or thereabouts, was the pleasing consequence. Un-
luckily, but not surprisingly, the fox proving to be a stranger in those parts,"
soon lost his way on the cliffs, and was killed at the South Foreland lighthouse.
A propos of the East Kent Foxhounds, it is rumoured that at no very distant
date, Mr. Sanger, of the Ramsgate Hippodrome, may accept the Mastership.
This would be a great gain to the " Hunt, as then, no doubt, Mr. Sanqeb would
put the vast resources of his menagerie at their Bervice, and make kangaroo-
chasing in England possible. Yours, A Thorough Spobtsmait.

"FOR ONE NIGHT ONLY."
(A Visit to Oxford, on occasion of the Opening of the New Theatre.)
Having received two stalls and an invitation to be present at the
opening of the new Theatre at Oxford, by the 0. U. D. S., i.e.,
Oxford University Dramatic Society, I felt that this was an occasion
when the
Pencil should
be associated
with the Pen,
and so I ask-
ed my friend
S a u I b B 8,
P.A., to ac-
company me,
as the 0. U.
D. S. would
be delighted
to welcome
him.
"I've ne-
ver seen Ox-
ford," said
S Q u I B b s.
"But when I
was a boy I
I knew a
chap who
was at Tri-
nity College, Dublin. So," he added, with that clear natural logic
which is his distinguishing characteristic, "I'll be very much inter-
ested in seeing the place.
The train duly arrived at Oxford at5'15, all superfluous ceremonial
was dispensed with, and we entered the Clarendon Hostelrie, where
lights and fires awaited us, a banquet for two, and a bottle of their
best. So far as he could see from the window of the fly, Squtbbs pro
fessed himself disappointed with his first view of the University.
"It's not a bit like Dublin," he said. "It might be anywhere."
At dinner I recounted to Squibbs the difficulties with which the
A. D. C. at Cambridge had to contend, how our performance was
kept as secret as a prize-fight, and how we were content to amuse
ourselves and our audience with laughable Adelphi farces, and
Bombastes Furioso with new songs; and I called to mind how we
chuckled over our own success when the information reached us that
all attempts of the Oxonians at getting up a Dramatic Club like
the A. D. C. had utterly failed, and that the Authorities would never
permit it. All which reminiscences, were pleasant for myself to
recall, and their narration naturally riveted the attention of my
companion, who not only drank in every word of my discourse, but
at least two glasses more than his share of the champagne in which
we were supposed to have an equal and united interest.
"What we shall see to-night," I observed to Squibbs, after a
modest effort on my part to restore the balance of glasses, will be
memorable in history. The University Theatre," I said, referring
for information to the bill of the play, "is opened to-night 'by
permission of the Reverend the Vice-Chancellor and the Worshipful
the Mayor.'"
"It will be very grand," exclaimed Sqtjibbs, almost gasping with
exoitement in anticipation of the show.
"It will," I replied, without removing my hand from the bottle
of sparkling and generous, of which I had now the sole command.
"I suppose," observed Squibbs, his voice tremulous with emotion
'' I suppose there '11 be all the great Bigwigs and Dons, in their robes
seated in the Theatre. I remember hearing that when the Lord
Lieutenant went to Trinity College, Dublin"
"My dear Squibbs," I say, compassionately, "what could be the
reception of a Lord Lieutenant in Dublin, at Trinity College,
to that of the Inauguration of the Great University Theatre, with
the Reverend—the Reverend, mark you, Squibbs—the Vice-Chan-
cellor, in his magnificent scarlet and gold robes of office, seated on
a kind of throne in the centre of the dress-circle front row, tem-
porarily converted into a huge State-Box, while on his left"—(" Let
us have another pint, Squibbs, my boy," and we do accordingly, as
I continue)—"while on his left are seated the Mayor and Corpo-
ration, in their robes and gold chains, and the house is brilliant
with the ladies of the County, visitors from Town, old Members of
the University in their Master of Arts' and Bachelors' hoods and
gowns; and in the orchestra itself, composed of University men in
gowns, will be seated the First Doctor of Music, whoever he may
be, in his black and gold robe, wielding the Conductor's baton!"
"It will be grand I" murmured Squibbs, quite; overcome, as I
carefully replenished his glass, and bade him cheer up.
"Then," I went on, for I had all this in my mind's eye, and enthu-
siasm made me eloquent; "then there will be the players, all
educated young men, and the Ladies, probably scholars from Girton
or Nuneham—in my time, at Cambridge, Ladies were not permitted
on our stage—(Sqtjibbs, my boy, let us drink to the Ladies!)—and
our youngest men took female characters, a custom, which, as you
are aware"
"Yes," interrupted Sqtjibbs, " Shakspearian. I know—but, I say,
as we've finished that pint, and the play begins at T45, and it's now
within five minutes of that, suppose"
"By all means," I rejoin. Andiamo!"
So we arose. Fired by my own imaginative description, I had fully
persuaded myself that I was going to assist at an Academical
show the like of which had never been seen in this or any other
University.
Thus thinking, I said to the waiter who helped me on with my
coat.
"The Theatre will be very full?"
"Yes, Sir, it will. There may be a roughish lot in the gallery to-
night, as it's Saturday."
'But," I said, "they can't get into the Theatre. It's only a
University affair, and private."
"Oh dear no, Sir. It's open to the public, on payment," he
replied.
"What!"' I exclaimed.
But at this moment Squibbs reappeared. "I'm afraid, Squibbs,"
said I, with a presentiment of coming disappointment, "I'm afraid,
Squibbs, this is going to be a sell."
The street is all alive with the sort of bustling crowd that may be
seen any night in Tottenham Court Road.
"Not much like a University town, this," observes Squibbs, and
there is something reproachful in his tone.
We turn down a muddy lane, called by courtesy a street, and here
there are policemen, an inspector, and a crowd watching the arrivals.
We make for the first door in front of us, where we see some young
men in evening dress. We enter.
The place is in a very unfinished state, and feels damp; there is a
distinct smell of paint, *" The impression of paint becomes still
more distinct
if you hap-
pen to come
in oontact
with a wall.
It leaves such
an impression
in fact as will
remain with
you to your
dye-ing day.
We are op-
posite a pay-
box. There
are directions
up "To the
Stalls," "To
the Dress
Circle." At
present it is
all very ordi-
nary, and not
in the least
Academical.
The young
men in even-
ing dress are
shaking hands with everyone who comes in. There is plenty of
laughing and chatting. But no one moves.
"Where are the box-keepers?" inquires Squibbs, of no one in
particular. He is a practical man, as are most artists.
It appears that these young gentlemen are the box-keepers,
as they at once cease their conversation to direct us to where we
shall find someone else, who will show us our seats. The Curtain
has not yet risen, but somebody is on the stage in front of it, making
a speech. It is the Prologue.
More masher box-keepers. "No fees, I suppose?" 1 say to them,
affably.
"No; no fees," they reply, smilingly. Then we are shown in.
We are in the stalls, and our stalls might as well be in the Olvmpic
or Vaudeville, or any other middle-sized London theatre for all
that there is specially characteristic of a great University about the
interior.
The house is mainly filled with University men, but the gaUery is
ocoupied by an ordinary gallery audience, such as might be seen in
any good provincial Theatre. The local hits in the Prologue,
however, go enormously with this mixed audience; and though
when Mr. Boubchteb, after appearing as The Spirit of Ancient
Drama—bearing a remarkable resemblance to the Wandering Jete,— .
reappeared as himself, in cap and gown, and delivered the Second |
Part of the Prologue, both Squibbs and myself laughed and applauded

as heartily as any four of them, yet this was rather due to our
politeness as guests than to our intelligent appreciation of the
evidently well written and clearly pointed allusions. The Spirit of
Ancient Drama at Oxford had bewailed his hard fate in having
been compelled, for some mysterious reason not set forth in the
Prologue, to "earn a wretched pittance at the ',Vic,'" and had
acknowledged a failure in attempting to "make them laugh with
poor burlesque,"—and had "tempted the scholar from his desk
with doubtful dance and more than doubtful song,"—which were
all, probably, severely satirical hits at some rival Dramatic
Society, which had at some other time courted success and
achieved failure. But in spite of these lofty denunciations, I could

and " Lucas will look as fresh as paint,"—roared at topical allusions
vociferously applauded the inevitable "Three Acres and a Cow,''
ingeniously introduced d propos of the University arms, and, when
Twelfth Nipht came, I also noticed that the scenes whicn were
received with the greatest favour, were just those where the
"business" was somewhat boisterous.
But my great disappointment was to find that this New Temple of
the Drama was, after all, only an ordinary Town Theatre, which
anyone with sixpence at his command could enter, and in which any
travelling company could play by permission of the Mayor and Vice-
Chancellor.
The 0. U. D. S., as a Club, ought to have its own Club House and
its own Theatre. The scenery for Twelfth Night was not worthy of
the occasion, though I dare say good enough to serve as the stock of
a provincial theatre, for it is only that. The costumes were just
of the ordinary hap-hazard kind that a supercilious theatrical cos-
tumier might have sent to any amateurs. As for the Ladies, Olivia
was all that an Hlyrian Princess ought to be; Viola, to judge alone
by her costume, understood the character perfectly; and, as to
Maria, I do not recollect ever having seen such a thoroughly confi-
dential maid. I would have trusted her with a secret anywhere,
aye, even before the most crowded audience.
Sir Andrew used a falsetto voice throughout, which must have
been very painful to himself: his performance was good, plenty of
"bubble," but too much " squeak." Malvolio gave us an entertain-
ment consisting of exceedingly clever imitations of Irving, Terby,
Arthur Cecil, and George Grossmith, which we all recognised in
detail and heartily applauded. Mr. Coningsbt Disraeli s strong
point, as a character with only one line to speak, was "bye-play,
which would have compelled the admiration of the audience if they
had only possessed some sort of
key to its meaning. Still, he
was undefeated, and the last we
saw of him was wagging his
head, and gesticulating, with
evidently the very best inten-
tions, as the Curtain went down.
That we were unable to trace
any resemblance between the
nephew and his illustrious
Uncle, was probably owing to
the excellence of his disguise as
an Ulyrian Sheriff's Officer,
with a highly coloured com-
plexion, a nose suspiciously
suggestive of pink wool, and a
brilliant auburn wig under a
flat black cap. He was probably
muttering to himself, perpetu-
ally, "A time will come when
they shall hear me,"—but, as a
matter of fact, on this particular
occasion the time in question
did not arrive, and we did not
hear him.
Mr. Bottrchter as the Clown
was uncommonly good; all the
actors were perfect in their
words; there were no hitches
in the scenery—a remarkable
thing this, considering that every rope, roller, and stitch of canvas
was brand-new—neither could anyone sing—

Feste the Clown, quite Fcste-rate.
'Tis the roice of the Prompter,
I heard him speak plain,
"You 've forgotten your words—
Don't forget 'em again,"
for the Prompter's place was a sinecure. Considering it as a first
night in a new theatre, and as a very great undertaking for young
Amateurs, Twelfth Night, as played by the 0. U. D. S., must be
pronounced a decided success.
There was a brilliant supper of the 0. U. D. S. afterwards at the
Blue Chin Club, when those who dared stayed out as late as possible,
and those who didn't dare, fled, like so many male Cinderellas, as the
clock struck twelve; and those to whom as graduates, or as four-
year men, College.rules were of little importance, remained till the

small hours got larger, and then we separated. Breakfast and con-
gratulations next morning.
"Well," said Squtbbs, meditating, as we journeyed up to town,
"I heard them talk of fellows not being able to go to rehearsal, be-
cause they were in training, or because of hunting, or because of
riding or tennis, but I didn't hear of anyone staying away because
he was studying. They sit up till all hours, they have big break-
fasts, lunches, and dinners—they are capital chaps—but when do
they study?"
Their parts, do you mean?" I asked, sleepily, for I confess that
irregular hours do not agree with me so well as they did, when I
kept them regularly.
Parts?" he returns, "No! I mean, when do they study their

Heal Study.
Latin, Greek, Mathematics, and that sort of thing? Why, I
remember a fellow I knew at Trinity, Dublin"
But drowsiness was too muoh for me, and I dropped off to sleep.
So did Squibbs. At Paddington we parted company, and after this
holiday we returned to work. Perhaps the Undergraduates are
returning to work also. I wish the 0. U. D. S. all success, and trust
they will in time play in their own Theatre. J. Penn Nibbs.

is a laughable farcical play called The Magis-
trate still being performed at the Court
Theatre, in which Mr. Arthur Cecil, as the
delinquent, has to be brought up before him-
self as the Magistrate. This is the case of
Mr. Childers sitting on his own Committee,
to inquire into the conduct of the Home
Office and Police during the recent disgraceful
riots. We trust Mr. Childers will be afforded
every opportunity of sitting on himself.]
VERT SURPRISING!
Lieutenant-Colonel Haddan, who com-
mands the 4th Volunteer Battalion of the
(Queen's) Royal West Surrey Regiment (in
which high-sounding title a Rifle Corps, with
Head-quarters somewhere in the suburbs, is
hidden) has announced his intention of hold-
ing a Surprise Parade." The affair was to
have been kept a profound secret; but some
of the details, have oozed out, of which the
following is a list, although the accuracy of
the alleged "surprises" cannot be vouched
for:—
1. Before the men are summoned, their uni-
forms are to be collected, and hidden at Head-
quarters, so that the Battalion may appear in
quaint costumes.
2. All Officers will be required to appear in
false noses and paper feathers, adding qurnt-
cork moustaches to their lips when possible.
3. The Field Officers will ride on to Parade
on clothes-horses.
4. The Band of the Regiment will be ex-
pected to play their instruments upside down,
the Big Drummer appearing on Parade in-
side his own Drum.
5. The Sergeant-Major will stand on his
head.
6. And the Commanding Officer will tender
his resignation.
If these rumoured manoeuvres (especially
the last) do not wake up the members of the
"4th Volunteer Battalion of. &c, &c," they
are past astonishing, and a "Surprise Parade,'
so far as they are concerned, will be utterly
useless.

When the Gay Cavauer
To the footlights drew near,
To ask, "Who it was hadn't paid f"
For the Pit was cross
At their evident loss
Of seats, and at friends coming free.
Says the Gay Cavalier,
"I'11 give anyone here
Who's not paid into custodee!
Yes, that cuss, that cuss,
I will give into custorfee.'" (bis).
He was cheered by the Pit
For his palpable hit,
The point of which some didn't see;
And a number felt small
As in many a stall
Sat a friend who had come in free.
When the play was done
Then everyone
Applauded vociferousfee,
Saying, "If we don't cheer,
This Gay Cavalier
May give us into custorfee .'

May give us into custorfee.'" (W»).

M.
LE BOXE ANGLAIS.
LE ReDACTEUR,
The account, graphic and elegant, of the great Prize-ring
Boxe-fight that displayed itself the other day at Chateau Lafitte,
supplied by your sportsmans print, your Daily Telegraph, has been
read by me with interest keen and joyful: for, admiring your
glorious institutions, your Oxfor-Cambridge Outrigge Course, your
Derby Race, your fox-ont, and footeball-match, shall I not welcome on
the soil of my native country the arrival of your heroes of "Le Prize-
ring," M. Alfred Greenfield and M. Smitz? Believe me, I salute
them. But, by a deplorable incident of mistaking the morning, I
was not present at the encounter, and so I have perused the account
of it furnished in his journal by your confrere. I said it was graphic
and elegant, but it is more. It is mysterious. Let me take le premier
"Round." Your confrere says. "Greenfield tried his left, but
missed. He then landed slightly; Smith countered on the jaw."
One is puzzled; one would ask what was the nature of the experi-
ment tried by M. Greenfield with his left; also on where did he
land slightly. Was he climbing? Then on what jaw did M. Smitz
counter? On his own? It is possible. But let us proceed.
Your confrere then desoribes the progress of the Boxe-fight, which,
with its first "knock-down-blow," its " vicious right-hander on the
ribs," and the " going down " of the two combatants in the corner,
must have been a spectacle at once splendid and exhilarating. In-
deed, the spectators, "les backers," were caught themselves in the
enthusiasm of the moment. I quote your confrere in extension. He
■ays, "The Birmingham men broke into the ring, and in the most
threatening way attacked the other side." This sight of the backers
swept on in thefury of their (lan, must have been truly magnificent.
He continues :—
"The referee, perfectly helpless, called on them to retire The
cry of 'Gendarmes!' was raised, and a few made their appearance. In the
meantime, Smith had twice walked to the centre of the ring for Gbeen-
heli) to be brought up, but on the last scare all cleared off to their carriages,
adjoining the field. One gentleman, well-known in racing circles southwards,
had a fearful blow from a knuckleduster on the side of the head, the blood
flowing copiously. He was helped to a carriage. One of Smith's seconds,
while picking him up in Goebnfiild's corner, received a serious blow on the
jaw. Several efforts were made to injure Smith, while down in this
corner, with sticks and feet, and Smith avers that his most severe blow was
from a kick in the jaw when down."
Thus we see not only M. Greenfield and M. Smitz, the two com-
batants, but all their compatriots animated by the same courage,
eager to join in "le Boxe-fight," and valiantly contest with each
other the fortunes of the day. Nor did the excitement of the affair
cease on the termination of the incident, for your confrere adds:—
"On the homeward journey Smith's carriage and another in which I was
Beated would probably have teen attacked. Some twenty men were urged by
their leader to overturn the carriages with their occupants."
Imagine the fervour of spirit evoked! The "backers" would
have attacked the carriage of M. Smitz. This recalls the glorious
traditions of your Tom-Saters, your Jem-Mace, your Ben-Gaunt!
But I must conclude. Let it suffice for me to say that I shall attend
with intrepidity the next Boxe-fight, providing at the same time for
my equipment a "knuckle-dusterre." Vive le Boxe-Anglais!
Receive, M. le Redacteur, the assurance of my distinguished consi-
deration. Jules Jean-Boule.
A SCORE FOR THE "STARS."
Listen to the " Voice of the Stars" for February, teste Zadkiel,
Astrologo:—
"Mars retrogrades through the sign Virgo this month, bringing troubles
and bloodshed in Turkey. Paris is disturbed, and it will be well for that city
if it be not the scene of bloodshed; for there is too much reason to apprehend
that the Red Republicans will give serious trouble and cause ententes.'
For "Paris" only read "London," and then, in relation to the
recent riots, you must see that the foregoing prediction has been almost
literally accomplished. When you consider the great distance of the
planets from the Earth, and the comparatively small space inter-
vening between London and Paris, you will see at a glance that the
malefic influences which, projected from the planetary bodies, were
calculated by Zadkiel as destined to strike Paris, but actually struck
London instead, flew, in striking the latter capital, not at all wide of
the mark. A very good shot of those, so to say, shooting-stars;
quite near enough, indeed, too near, the bull's-eye—John Bull's
eye. On the part of Zadkiel decidedly "a hit—a very palpable
hit." Right you are again, Zadkiel Tao Sze t

THE NEXT MILITAEY BANQUET.
(A Olimpse into the Future.)
After the Loyal Toasts had been duly honoured, the Chairman of
the evening proposed "Our Foreign Visitors," assuring them of
the gratitude that England felt to them for the assistance they had
rendered in the recent war. The toast was received with the utmost
enthusiasm.
In reply, the German Ambassador called attention to the bond of
union binding Britain and the Fatherland, dating from the Heptarchy
and the days of the Saxon Kings. (Clteers.) If the nation of
which he was proud to be a representative had been able to supply
the English Army with the rifles, cannons, bayonets, and swords
with which the late victories had been secured, Germany was only too
pleased to have secured this very satisfactory result. {Loud cheers.)
The French Ambassador also returned thanks, saying, that his
countrymen did not grudge their neighbours the boots that had led
them to victory. (Cheers?) Very possibly the victories would have
been obtained without those French boots. (" No, no.'") Well, he
would let them have their way, and merely say that France would
always assist Albion, as on the present occasion, to share with her
theglory—whic h is France. {Enthusiasm.)
The Spanish Minister deprecated too much being made of the fact
that the gunp owder which had been used by the British Troops during
the recent ca mpaign had been imported from the country to which
he owed his birth. No doubt it meant, he said, that with this assist-
ance Spain, and not England, had won the recent conquests—(" Hear,
hear.'")—but surely Spain owed the land of Wellington a heavy debt
of gratitude. (Cheers?) _ Spain was pleased to have been in a position
to wipe out an obligation which commenced with the Peninsular
War. {Cheers.)
The Minister of the Swiss Republic said that if England s Army
had been clothed by the hardy mountaineers who once had defied
the Austrian Army, and put th.e bold Duke of Burgundy to flight,
both countries might well be proud of the result. {Cheers.) Switzer-
land felt no jealousy, and invited the British Army to add these
victories to their regimental flags, following the example already set
(so he just had heard by telegraph) by the Standard-bearers of the
Old Swiss Guard. {Indescribable enthusiasm.)
Other speeches of a similar character followed, and the evening
passed away in the most perfect harmony, several of the Foreign
Representatives courteously begging the pleasure of an introduction
to the Commander of the British Army during the late campaign,
politely insisting " that he, by his strategy, had become quite one of
themselves in the triumphs of the day, and that they therefore must
really acknowledge his assistance!"
NICE CARNIVAL.—WANTED, a few to make up small party. A
fortnight's pleasant stay in South of France. First-class travelling and
hotel reduced rates.
A nice young man wanted for a Nice excursion. How destitute of
friends and companions must the man be who advertises for a small
party, or who answers the advertisement.
A Merry Mandarin.—According to announcement, the Chinese
Minister-designate to Great Britain, in succession to the Marquis
Tseng, is Lin Shin Fun. A name of good omen for making things
pleasant.
Where does Mr. J. L. Toole stay when he visits Paris ?—Why,
the Tooleries, of course.
The Daily Telegraph mentioned a "Conservative Oyster Feast."
This is evidently wrong. Wherever there is an Oyster Feast, let it
be a real Liberal one.

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Houte of Comment, Thursday, February 18. — Mornings un-
pleasantly dark and cold now. Turned out at Five this morning;
made my way down to the House to secure seat. Found nearly all
the best gone. Secured one on back Bench above the Gangway.
Borrowed hat from Opposition Benches, and put it on seat. How
surprised other fellow will be when he comes to take his seat! Don't
like anything mean or underhand. No two hats for me, one to
wear, [and one to secure seat. Good deal of talk just now about
Policies —Irish Policy, Foreign Policy, Home Policy, and No Policy.
For me, Honesty is the best Policy.
"Went back to breakfast and spent easy day, with certainty of

wonder? Can't be Campbell-Bannf.rman, because I got it from
other side. However, must get rid of it somehow. Nobody looking.
Put own hat on bench, put the other one on head, and jauntily march
down the House; hang hat up in the Lavatory, and come out whist-
ling. Meet Cavendish Bentinck, with hair fearfully bristled and
scowl on expressive face. Seems he's been subjected to gross out-
rage. Came down early, secured good place; returned just now,
ana finds hat gone, and seat appropriated.
"Dear me, I say, whilst Cavendish gnashes his teeth. "Must
be one of those New Members."
Mention, by the way, that I saw a hat in the Lavatory apparently
without owner. Cavendish darts off with long strides towards
Lavatory. He is so very excitable.
Met Harcoubt in Corridor, strolling towards Lords. "Lords not
met yet," I said.
"No, Toby, I know; but I like to look at the place when it's
empty. Come along!"
Place tenantless and sombre-looking. Harcoubt dropped on the
Woolsack with a heavy sigh.
"Ah! what might have been! What might have been, Toby!"
he murmured.
I walked aside, not caring to be witness of this sacred emotion.
Looked back as I passed out. Harcoubt, still sitting on the Wool-
sack, was " wisibly swellin' " before my eyes, till he seemed to fill
the Chamber, crushing noble Lords and highborn Dukes against the
very walls.
Not very lively in the Commons except when Randolph made
sprightly attack on the Government, and Gladstone replied with
tears of melancholy in his voice at the notion that there could be
anybody so hopelessly wicked as Randolph. Very early in the
sitting Childers caused permanent depression of spirits by his
illimitable statement on the Riots. What he had to say was that
Commission of Inquiry was now sitting, and would report at earliest
possible date. But opportunity not to be missed. Droned on for
more than half-an-hour, under the envious glance of Sexton, and
amid signs of growing impatience on part of House.
Really said one funny thing, though, of course, unconsciously.
Wanting to allude to W. H. Smith, and not quite knowing how
he had been left when the late Government went out, he leaned
across the table, and said interrogatively, "Chief Secretary?"
Smith blushed violently, but acknowledged the title.
"It's a curious thing, Toby," he said afterwards, "that no one
quite knows who I am. You remember Dizzy's ' W. H. Smith—or is
it H. W. ?' and now here's Childers doesn't know whether I was at

Towards end of half-hour Childers, soothed by his own oratory,
was in such good-humour, that nothing less than raising Picton to
the Peerage would suit him. "My noble friend," he said, turning
with gracious courtesy towards the" Member for Leicester; at which
the House tittered, and Childers wondered what on earth they
were laughing at now. Business done.—Address agreed to, "witn
grammatical alterations."
Friday.—House of Lords sat twenty minutes to-night.
"Going early," I said to the Markiss, who was being helped on
with his coat in the Lobby.
"Yes," said he, carefully wrapping scarf about his throat. "It
would not do for us to break down at the outset. At any moment we
may be called upon to save the Empire: and it would be a fearful thing
if we were found wanting. So we shall begin gently, with sittings a
quarter of an hour or so, presently going the full length of two hours."
In the Commons Courtney took the Chair in Committee. "I
think, Toby," he said, when I congratulated him. "that at last I
have found my right place. See what a wide field I shall have for
differing from everybody else. Besides, I shall have full opportu-
nity of shutting up anybody. Have tried it for some years in puhlio
speech and private conversation, but not always succeeded. Now
I'm what you may call—though, if anyone else used the term, I
should rule it was not Parliamentary—cock of the walk. When I
open my mouth, let no dog bark—not even you, dear boy. As for
Gladstone, I '11 make him sit up-^or rather, sit down. He said he
never could understand Proportional Representation. WeU, I'll
teach him that, and much else, now that he cannot argue with me.
Yes, I think I '11 do. I wonder I never thought of this before."

The Hon. C. R. Spencer,
1, Groom-in-Waiting.
Lobby long unknown. Alway3 bustling about, book in hand jotting
down unutterable things.
"Worst of it is," saysLEVESON-GowEB, "that we don't know every-
body yet. Gladstone cannot elaborate Irish policy in three days,
neither can we learn to know all the new
Men in same time. Constantly stopping
Conservatives at the door, and letting our
own fellows walk out. Yesterday, Bobby,
using all his winning art, induced three
fellows to stay in the House to dinner.
When division came, they voted against us.
They were Conservatives, and only for
Bobby would have been away dining.
Bobby rather down in the mouth, to-
night. Thought this little affair weighed
on his mind. Told him to cheer up. Such
accidents always happen at the meeting of
new Parliament.
"Oh, it's not that," said our Parlia-
mentary Groom-in-Waiting. "Worse
than that. What do you think one of those
New Members said to me. 'Sure, you '11 be
glad when the nights get a little warmer,
Mr. Spencer,' says he. 'What for ?' says
I. 'Well,' he says, 'it must be cold wait-
ing out in the Yard to hold Members'
horses;' and he was quite serious too."
And Bobby, who since he became Parlia-
mentary Groom has tightened his trousers
about the knees and worked in another
eighth of an inch in the height of his
collar, dashed violently after a Conserva-
tive who was leaving the House.
"Have you paired?" I heard him say,
producing his note-book, with a smile and a little bow, as if he were
asking for " the pleasure of the next dance," and all unawares that
he was entertaining an enemy.
Quiet evening in Committee of Supply. John Mobxey bewitched
Pamellites, who studiously refrained from embarrassing business.
Peter Rylands and Sir George Balfoub, seizing opportunity,
rushed in, and we had quite an old-times sitting with the Estimates.
Business done.—Supply.
THE SAVOYARDS.
Foe the lever du rideau at the Savoy there is one of the prettiest
woodland scenes ever placed on a stage. It is oalled The Carp, and
of course, as Mr. Wagstaff
immediately observed,
gives ocoasion to carping
critics. It is not worth
seeing twice: we cannot
say da capo to the Carp.
Alfred Cellier's music
is pretty. It reminded me
of some very elegant Ger-
man-Reed piece in the old
Gallery of Illustration,
only with the fun left out.
However, all the fun comes
later on, in the Second
Act of the Mikado, when
Messrs. Babeington,
Gbossmith, and the Ladies,
Leonora Braham, Jessie
Bond, and Sybil Grey,
rollick all over the place,
and revel in the "comic
business" of the Scene. I
don't remember so much
whacking in any piece
since the last time I saw
Mr. Toole in lei on parle Francois, when he and the Major (I think
it is a Major—there generally used to be a Major in those old-
fashioned farces) sit down together, and he and Speigglns go through
a sharp courso of slapping which used to convulse the audience.
The musical acrobats or the Savoy are perfectly riotous in their
dances and slap-banging, the audience is enraptured, and "The
Flowers that Bloom in the Spring, Tra la," is given, by request,
about five times, with a fresh set of steps, movements, leaps, and
bounds to every encore. I don't know whether Mr. Geossmith can
take his whack, but he can certainly give it, and the way in which
he puts his hand to the Bond—Miss Jessie Bond—is fun to the
audience, and I hope it is so also to the charming little Miss Jessie,
who is "one of the Lifes and Souls " of the Opera. Blunt Nibbs.

THE INDIGNANT DUCHESS.
The Post of Mistress of the Robes was respectfully declined by the
Duchess of Roxbueghe, because the Duke was unable to support Mr.
Gladstone's Irish policy. At first sight, this seems an odd sort of
reason for the refusal of the Duchess to accept Heb Majesty's oftioe.
If the Robes were kept in the Queen's Cabinet, then as Mr. Glad-
stone is in the Cabinet, we can perfectly understand the Duchess's
difficulty. So far, so good; but the next question is; what is the
Irish policy that Mr. Gladstone has adopted, and which the Duke
cannot support P Who knows? Will the Duke inform us? Can
Mr. Gladstone tell us? We doubt it. Very well: then if the
Robes are not kept in the Cabinet, and if Mr. Gladstone has no
policy, the Duchess of Roxbueghe may, after all, reconsider her
decision, and undertake the important office of guarding the state
velvets from the incursion of the moths.
Not Mb. Gladstone's Motto— Litera scripta manet. On the
contrary, it would be better, perhaps, if a lot of them did remain, and
were never posted.
Some one who had never heard of Lord de Yesci writes to say,
that as it's an Irish title, "Vesci" is probably only another way of
spelling " Whiskey."

PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
CONCERNING A SHILLING RETAINER.

"A Telegram, Sir," said my Clerk, Portington, intercepting me
as I walked from Fleet Street to the Thames Embankment. "It
has been in Chambers since three o'clock, and I wasn't quite sure
whether I ought to take it to the Club or Burmah Gardens."
"The Club, as a rule, is preferable," I replied. "Matters of a
purely business character—you understand, Portington, purely
business character—I do not care to go to my private address.
Upon this I opened the Telegram, and found it was from the lady
who, many years ago, did me the honour of accepting my heart, my
wig, and my bands. Josephina—who always likes to be explicit—
had contrived to give me the desired information with a noble
disregard to the Post-office regulations relative to the twelve-words-
inclusive-of-address-limit, which filled me with respect. Her
despatch ran as follows:—
To A. Briefless, Esquire, Junior.
12, Pump-Handle Court, Temple, E.C., London.
Cook—as Nurse is out with the children—is taking this to the
Post-office to ask you to come home at once, I want to see you at
once, so please come home as soon as you can. Cook is sending the
same Telegram as this Telegram to you, at the Club, so that if you
are not there, you may get it at the Chambers, if you are there, and
not at the Club.
Reflecting that the Telegrams (which were signed by my wife
with all her Christian names and full address) must have cost about
five shillings a-piecc, I hurried from mv Chambers, dashed into
a hansom, and was soon at Burmah Gardens. On mv arrival a
number of youthful heads looking out of the nursery windows joy-
fully disappeared, to reappear again almost immediately in the hall,
whence I was escorted in triumph to the drawing-room to the
presence of my wife. The children then retired, feeling, no doubt
(poor little things!) that the scene about to follow would, be too
painful for them to witness. My wife was greatly agitated.
"He came in," she said, "and gave me this. We thought he
was your brother Harbt, and so called to him, over the banisters, to
walk up and have some tea, as I didn't know whether our new
parlour-maid had ever seen luni, and so he came in here, and gave
me that."
I comforted my wife, as woll as I could, and looked at the docu-
ment. It was a subpoena, calling upon me to attend a trial, in which
Mr. Gregory Thunder, the plaintiff, was to appear in person.
I frankly confess that my heart began to beat faster. The name of
Gregory Thunder was perfectly well-known to me as a most
persistent and successful litigant, who had a way, however, with him.
of making his witnesses in one trial, the defendants in the next.
What had I done to attract the attention of Mr. Gregory Thunder T
"Not that he wasn't all right, when I and the children grew
accustomed to him," said my wife, wiping her eyes. "But he
frightened me, for the moment, as you see, I thought he was Harry.
And yet he was most civil, and put a shilling on the mantel-
piece, which he said was for you. I don't know why he should give
you a shilling, but of course it was kindly meant."
I frankly confess that the next few days I spent very, very
dismally. I had no wish to be mixed up with Mr. Gregory
Thunder's disputes. This wonderful man was most energetic, but
like other clever people, very liable to take offence. I ascertained
that the action in which I had been called as a witness was one for
slander, connected with a new invention, of which he was the patentee.
Beyond this I knew nothing, save that it was the general opinion of
my friends that I had better not approach him to ask him what he
wanted from me (as I would willingly have done), as he might mis-
understand me; and a "misunderstanding" with Mr. Gregory
Thunder opened out a vista of almost endless litigation.
The day for trying the cause at length arrived, and I, imitating
the example of many other unfortunate witnesses, seated myself in a
back pew in one of the numerous courts attached to the Queen's
Bench Division. The apartment was thronged, as it was rumoured
abroad that Mr. Gregory Thunder, in his zeal to vindicate the fair
fame of his patent, had subpoenaed half London. The proceedings
commenced, but I needed them not, as I was employing myself in
making, what is called by the adherents of the Church of Rome,
"an examination of conscience." I knew that Mr. Gregory Thun-
der rarely asked any one to give testimony on his behalf without
treating the testifier as a hostile witness. Most anxious not to
commit perjury, I consequently worried myself trying to remember
whether if at any time in my life I had threatened, in a momentary
fit of irritation (of course without any real intention of carrying the
threat into force) to poison my maiden aunt, and endeavoured to decide
whether I should be justified m asserting that I had never been
guilty of house-breaking, in the face of the fact that I had once in
my schooldays abstracted an apple from a shed adjacent to my
dormitory after nine o'clock. While I was considering these (to me)
very weighty matters, my name was called, and I found myself,
somehow or other, standing in the witness-box. While I was being
sworn, Mr. Gregory Thunder glared at me with an expression
of triumphant sternness, suggesting that he considered me his
bitterest enemy, bound hand and foot for his delectation.
"Now, Sir, be careful," he said, shaking his forefinger at me,
"and remember that you are on your oath."
I replied, as haughtily as I could, that I was aware of the fact.
Still, the reminder caused my recollections of the possible threat
about poisoning my maiden aunt, and the admitted abduction of the
stolen school apple, to become intensely and painfully distinct.
"Now, Sir, were you ever in the Thames Tunnel r"
I was so completely taken aback at this totally unexpected ques-
tion, that I could not answer. I hesitated, stammered, and for a
moment could, for the life of me, make no reply.
"Yes or no, Sir—were you ever in the Thames Tunnel? " repeated
Mr. Gregory Thunder, indignantly.
The Counsel for the Company looked at me half compassionately,
as a right-minded Roman Heathen might have regar ded an early
Christian Martyr being led away, condemned, to the arena. The
presiding Judge filled his pen with ink, sternly, and made ready to
take down an answer, which, from a legal point of view, might entail
the most disastrous consequences. Suddenly a light broke in upon
me. With a rush, like a flood of silvery sunshine, or the music of
angel voices, came the recollection that, as a matter of fact, I never
had been in the Thames Tunnel—never in my life—I said so.
"Then," replied Mr. Gregory Thunder, perfectly self-possessed,
and as if the remark he was about to make was the most natural
thing in the world, "it must have been some other man!" And he
sat down.
After a feeble protest on the part of the Judge, and the Counsel
for the Company, "about the time of the Court being wasted," the
incident being accepted as part and parcel of a " case conducted in
person," came to an end.
I was free! I hastened home! The reaction from doubt to cer-
tainty was painful to the last degree. For weeks this examination
had been causing me unspeakable discomfort. A highly nervous
man, the fact that I was going into the witness-box to be questioned
about I knew not what, had filled me with vague and ungrounded,
but, nevertheless, torturing apprehensions. The door was opened
for me by my eldest son, a boy rising nine.
"Papa, dear," said my first-born, holding up his face to be kissed,
"will you give me that shilling?"
"What shilling, my little man P"
"The shilling you got from that gentleman. You know, Papa,
darling—the shilling with the subpoena, that Mamma said cost you
nothing."
Cost me nothing!!! A. Briefless, Junior.

THE STOCK EXCHANGE
IN SEARCH OF A JOB.
A Voice from, the Banks of the Really Unemployed.
"As r chance of a job?" That's the fiftieth time I have put the
same question already this week,
The fiftieth time I havo had the same answer, a sharp-spoken "No,
Mate!" I might as well seek
A fortune as fourpence an hour in these times; and the Missus and
kids they are just about done.
Some Swell asks the question if life is worth living. He'd answer
it sharp after months o' this fun.
Worth living? You've heard of some hard-driven chaps as have
finished the game off with pistol or knife;
Then they call it insanity, don't they? No doubt; but yon give
beak or bobby a taste of this life,
Say for just a short twelvemonth, and they'd understand how it
raises the fiend in a broken-down bloke
When tho sticks are all sold, and the young 'uns go white, and of
work, that would save 'em, you can't get a stroke.
I 'vc walked off my boot-soles a-tramping the town in the frost and
the slush, and with nothing inside.
Been down to the Docks; I can handle my tools, but six months of
starvation soon lowers one's pride.
I've tried every shop from Blaekfriars to Blackwall, and as far t'other
way—ah, for seven mile round!
And if there's a job in the whole blessed place, then ray luck is dead
out, for it ain't to be found.
The gate-keepers know me, my old figgcrhead asks the question
itself, and the answer comes pat.
"Any chance of a job?" If I wanted to rob, or to beg, tho snub
couldn't come sharper, that's flat.
Can you guess how I feel as I turn on my heel with the dull
hang- dog look that comes over a chap
After passing his day-hours from week-end to week-end in tramping,
and trying, and touching his cap?
I feel like a dog nosing after a bone, and that feeling ain't likely to
stiffen one^ back.
Sometimes an old chum stands a glass, just for luck, or invites me
to join in his one o'clock snack;
But mostly it's nix minus nothing all day, and at night with the
wife and the nippers, you see,
If there is bite and sup, 'taint much strength a man gets out of
bread and potatoes, and cat-lappy tea.
If it weren't for a pipe now and then from the pouch of this party or
that, I could hardly hold on,
And the Missus can't whiff, nor the young 'uns, worse luck! and
our best hits o'things, one by one, are all gone.
There's nothing to raise half a dollar on left that I see. The wife's
wedding-ring, Polly's first prize,
My pet concert inn, and most of our togs,—ah! the look of the place
orings the tears to one's eyes.
"Come up to the Park," says Jack Rdgoles—he spouts—" and just
hear me lay on to the rich 'uns." Not me!
Chucking things ain't my mark, whether words or half bricks.
Master Jack never works, and he's brisk as a bee.

But to watch the kids starve, with my mu soles still strong, when there's
nothing that muscles can do 1 would shirk.
That's hard on a chap, and the choice between that and the poor
house or charity doles is a choice
Which, put to a square-minded man, makes him feel that there's
something wrong somewhere, could sense give it voice.
The Shops are all full—or else empty; the docks have about fifty
hands stretching after each job.
Turn which way I will I see no one as wants me, not even the off-chance
of earning a bob.

And yet what's the good r It is four-forty now, and I feel I shall
drop if I keep on the tramp.
It was just such a fix drove poor Featherby mad; decent fellow he
was. but no nerve at a pinch.
He had been out o' work for ten months at a stretch; his pet daughter
was dying of cold, inch by inch,
His wife,—well she roughed on him—women have tongues—and I
fancy a something went wrong in his head.
"Death's better than this!" shrieks the poor harried fool. And the
light o' next morning saw four of 'em dead.
Yes, that's how it works, on the weak ones at least, when it's kept
up a little too long for their brains,
Or their hearts, or whatever it is that goes first, which I don't think
as science exactly explains.
I know Polly's eyes sometimes make me see red when they look at
me out of her pale peaky face,
And a wild sort of passion boils up in my blood, and I have to rush
out from the sight o' the place.
Tramp! tramp! tramp! I am footsore and faint, and the night's
coming down, ana I'm bound to turn home,
But I shrink from the looks that will meet mine with hope, and then
fall when they see there ain't nothing to come.
An old old story that thousands could tell. Do you happen to know

That shakes a man's chest as he turns, empty-handed, from one more
long journey in search of a job f
ROMANCE IN SEPTEMBER.
(A Sketch taken in London after the establishment of the Extra Session.)
"The autumn tints on the leaves are charming," said the Lady
Blanche de Paddinqton, as she sat on a chair in the Row. watching
the horses of the riders, and the carriages of her friends, as they
passed and repassed in scores and hundreds.
"Quite so, returned Lord Snobberley. "I consider London per-
fection in September—quite perfection. Much better fun here than
knocking about in a yacht."
"Or snooting partridges in your place in the country f" queried
the fair girl, with a smile.
"Well, I oertainly miss them a little. But it will be all right next
month," returned the Viscount, more cheerfully, "we have had Borne
of the Gamekeepers up, and are preserving Eaton Square. I hope
to give your father, the Earl, some capital pheasant-shooting there
in a fortnight."
"Thanks on his behalf," said Blanche, with a little bow charming
in its coquettish mockery. "No doubt, however, he will be able to
return the compliment by affording some really good fox-hunting, at
Christmas, in the Kensington Gardens."
"So I am told. By the way, your brother Algernon says that he
and two other fellows have managed to stock the Serpentine with
salmon. Is it really so?" The Lady Blanche nodded, and rising
from her chair, strolled away with her companion.
They had seen a great deal of one another in years gone by in
country houses, but it was only now that they actually met in a
perfectly friendly fashion. The restraint of the provinces was
thrown off in favour of that freedom so eminently characteristic of
the Metropolis of the world.
"Where are you going this evening ?" asked the Viscount (he was
an Irish Peer with a seat in the House of Commons), as again they
paused to rest themselves. "I saw you at Cabx Rosa's Opera, last
night, but could not get near you."
Mamma is taking me to the Albert Hall to hear Gounod's last
Oratorio. The Queen, the Prince, and the Princess will be there;
and then we go on to the Ball at the German Embassy."
"Quite a novelty to see Buckingham Palace tenanted," com-
mented Lord Snobberley, "especially in September."
And so they chatted on, until they came to a more secluded part of
the Park. It was then that he opened his heart to her, telling her
his prospects, and explaining his plans.
"It is coming at last!" she murmured as she turned her blushing
face away from him. Suddenly Two struck from a neighbouring
belfry. She listened eagerly for his impassioned accents. But they
had ceased. She turned round—he had gone!
Biting her proud under-lip, she picked up a piece of paper which
he had dropped at her feet, and which was inscribed with her name.
She opened it. It ran as follows :—
"I am obliged to be off. If I am not in the House before the
quarter past, I shall be suspended."
"So so," murmured the fair girl, with an expression of resent-
ment seated upon her beautiful features, "and thus you prefer the
House to mef When we are married, my Lord, you shall retire
from Parliament." Then she sighed deeply, and repeated, with
painful emphasis, "When?"
Already the House was struggling with the Home!
AN ASYLUM FOR THE SANE.

AM^4«»
'M the Emperor of China, though, for
reasons of my own,
I desire that the fact should not be
generally known.
It might injure my position—for perhaps! should explain
That I keep an Institution for the Treatment of the Sane.
If my estimable patients should discover who I am,
And find out that all my claims to be demented are a sham,
They might deem me an impostor, and adopt the silly fad
Of believing me incompetent to drive them raving mad.;
Those who dwell in my asylum have been men of shining parts,
At some former time connected with the sciences or arts,
Versed in statesmanship, diplomacy, theology or law.
One and all possessed of intellects that once were void of flaw.
Men who managed to endure the dull constraint of social gyves
Till they found out that 'twas futile to lead reasonable lives;
That the source of human sorrow is a nicely balanced brain,
And that only those are happy who are more or less insane.
I've an aged Mathematical Professor, by the way,
Whose intelligence I'm slowly undermining, day by day;
When he came to me, in algebra he'd ceased to take delight,
And was bored to death—or nearly so—by always being right.
Not the differential calculus itself could make him smile,
Nor could fine old crusted cubic roots his saddened soul beguile.—
Now he merrily avers that he's the happiest man alive,
For he entertains no doubt at all that two and two make five.

If there's one thing I am proud of, 'tis a brilliant cure I wrought
On a Doctor who persistently against my system fought.
He agreed to undergo it, "as it certainly was new,
Just to test it from a purely scientific point of view."
I contrived to make him gibber ere a fortnight had elapsed;
In another week his memory had utterly collapsed.
Now he gaily mops and mows from rosy morn to dewy eve,
Quite the gladdest—and the maddest—of my patients, I believe.
I've a Minister, who docs not in the least know what he means,
A delightful maniac Bishop and a brace of driVlling Deans.
I've a oelebrated Journalist, whose brain I know is cracked,
For he will insist that style should be subordinate to fact.
There's my eminent Musician, too, whose sense of time and tune
I have shaken to its base, and hope to shatter very soon;
As it is, I note with rapture that he regularly fails
To distinguish "Tultochgorum" from "Ood Bless the Prince of
Wales!"
When I think of these successes, and of all the good I've done,
I feel certain that my mission is indeed a blessed one;
Yet I yearn in opium ecstasies my consciousness to whelm,
And to toy with Golden Lilies in my own Celestial Realm,
Where, by signing a death-warrant with my gay vermilion scrawl,
I could cure the sanest person of his troubles once for all.
But no matter! Here, in exile, I propose to end my days;
For the English climate snits me, and—my Institution pays!

it than he does his Portmanto. A pretty sort of life an Hed Waiter
would lead if he was trubbled with either of these nuisances!
If I mite wenture to hotter just one word of warnin to my nobel
Paytrons, the London diners-out, it wood be just this one. Go back
to your good old fashun of, when you 're a dining out, taking it
heasy, and carm, and quiet, and don't waste your presshus time in
torking and larfing, or you '11 cum to the same orful condition as our
Amerrycane Cozens, who, I am oreddibly informed, gobbles up their
dinners in about 10 minnets, and, as a natural consequents, weighs
about 10 Stun all round. Fanoy a grand old Copperashun composed
of sitch men I In course I means my sollem warning to apply ony
to the reel dinnertime; wen that's all over and there's nothink
more to heat than a lot of frute and sitch rubbish, then's the time
for tork and larfter, and that reminds me of a werry jolly heavening
as I spent the other nite.
As a trew Conserwatif I'm natrally opposed to all change. But
we had wun the other heavening as I'm quite prepared to sankshun,
aye, and heven patronize. I was ofishyatm at one of our tip top West
End Otels, and we had one of them jolly Cheermen as not only don't
make no long tiresum speeches hisself, but don't allow not noboddy

else for to do it. So to fill up the wacant time wot does he do but
inwites the werry merryest, and jollyest, and pianny-forty-play-
ingest gennelman as I hever seed or herd, and in course I've seed a
goodish lot. His name was Mister Gbowsmith and he cum to us for
jest a hower or too afore he went to the Sawoy Theater, where Brows
tried werry hard to perswade me as he was a going to hact a kind of
Japan'd Jack Ketch, but I wasn't quite sitch a fool as to beleeve that
rubbish. Well if he didn't sit down to the Pianny and sing us such
a jolly lot of songs as made us all,waiters and all, rore again. One
speshally, about going to see in a Yot, cum home speshally to me, as
rm about as bad a Sailor as an Horse-Marine. He cum late and
went hurley, to our grate regret, but play hacting obleegee, as the
French says, and hordienoes, speshally Gallerys, won't wait for no
man. I noticed as amost the ony thing as he het was Salary,so I spose
that '8 the fav'rite dish with Hacters as with Copperashun Hofncers.
And now turns another of the wunderfool ewents of my umbel life.
As he was a leaving, he acshally shook ands with me werry artily,
and he says, says he, "I'm werry glad to have seen you, Mr. Robert,
as I've often wished to do, for I bleeves as we both elps to emuse the
Publio in our warious ways!" and before I coud ask him him wot on
airth he ment, he was gorn. So I need ardly say as that dinner lives
in my memmery, not only for its own speshal helegance, and its
sensible Chairman, but for the grand change he hintroduced of giving
us plenty of cappital and most emusing songs insted of long and
dreary speeches, and for the honner conferd upon me^ a pore umbel
Waiter, by one who I am oreddibly informed is the delite of all cercles
and the idle of his hone.
Brown told me as how as he was told by a frend of one of the Irish
Members as how as they was so ard up at one time for Irish Parnellite
candied-dates, that they thort of getting a few Forren ones, and as I
was harf a Welchman, and pretty well anyone was good enuff for
'em, it was quite on the pack of cards as they wood have accepted
me! Reelly Brown has sitch a flattering way of paying a grate
complement that one carnt help likin him. He said as how the
terrems, as they calls 'em, wasn't at all bad, wiz., five pound a weak
and ewerythink found, but the hours was sumtimes xcrusheatinglate,
but to make up for it, we had, like the other skool boys, a hart
hollyday on Wensdays and a hole 'un on Satterdays.
"AN OLD PARLIAMENTARY HAND."
"I thank thee, Weo, for teaching us that word."
Shaksfeark {Tory version).
Was loud Gratiano more noisily grateful
To Shylock the Jew for the word he had lent,
Than are Tories to him, the eternally hateful,
Who aids their slack wits with such simple content?
"What, what shall we term him—the traitor black-hearted,
The trickster, the trimmer, the scourge of our land P
By Jove! he himself the straight tip hath imparted!
Let's call him the Old Parliamentary Hand!
"So sweetly equivocal, charmingly sinister!
Means—well, it means whatsoever we like.
A proud, hoighty-toity, magnanimous Minister,
What could more snakishly, lethally strike?
Suggests Artful Dodger, and Jeremy Diddler.
With dexterous handling, which tee understand,
Shows what a shy fiddler and casuist riddler
Are found in the Old Parliamentary Hand.
"It would not have done any damage to Dizzy,
Who commonly spoke with his tongue in his'cheek.
But he, the proud Bayard? Ah, let us be busy,
And hurl the small shaft at him ten times a week.
Jove, dropping his bolt, twangs this dart, d la Cupid,
And lesser toxophilites all round the land
Follow suit. If the stale iteration grow stupid,
All's fair—'gainst the Old Parliamentary Hand!
"No doubt it is open to other constructions.
In days when State-driving's so ticklish a task,
With kickers, and jibbers, and general ructions,
It seems very much what true wisdom would ask.
A green hand, like Phaethon, hardly suffices;
Automedon s services could one command,
One would not take Jehu for corners and crises,
But trust to an Old Parliamentary Hand.
"But that's common sense, and not partisan smartness.
The phrase from the lips of the enemy sped.
And seems, with some twist, due to word-trick and tartness,
To fly, like a boomerang, back at his head.
We may not be able to "draw him "—he's clever!—
But Jeremy Diddler's a role hardly Grand;
And so let us howl on for ever and ever,
'Yah! booh! You 're an Old Parliamentary Hand!'"

VERY MUCH HARRY'D.
(A Visit to the Princess's, and a Suggestion as to how the Play came to
be Written.)
'Hknbt Author Jones," said Wilson Barrett, one morning,
""What shall I play next?"
"Let me see," replied Henry Author—"you've done the
classic"
"Oh, d—ash the classic!" exclaimed Wilson. "No more Clau-
dian and Brutus for me. And no Shakspeare just now."
"Of course not," rejoined Henry Author, much relieved, as, if
Shakspeare was to be called in, why was he summoned? Then,
after some consideration—" They're doing a nautical subject at the
Adelphi."
"Yes," observed Barrett, thoughtfully. "I almost wish—but
no"—(Jones trembled. Was W. B. meditating calling in Petttt, or
Sims, or both?) "I think," resumed W. B., "I might have done
the gay, dashing young Sailor—eh?"
"It would have suited you down to the ground!" cried Davy
Jones, enthusiastically.
"Down to the sea, you mean," playfully returned W. Babbett:.
whereat, it being a Manager's joke, Jones went into convulsions of
laughter. When sufficiently recovered, he ventured to suggest "a
good domestic subject."
"What! with Willard as a Masher Villain again?" exclaimed
W. Barrett. "Won't do. It's played out."
"How about the Cromwellian period?" said Jones, more as if
communing with himself than addressing the Manager. "I began a
sketch of a play some time ago, with Cromwell in it."
"Yes—yes^says W. B., musingly. "Not bad. Oliver's not
unpopular. Henry Irvtno made a hit as Charles the First."
You'd make up splendidly for Cromwell.'" insinuates Jones.
W. Barrett turns on him a scrutinising glance. Up to now he
had had no reason to suspect Henry Author Jones of anything in
the way of a joke or subtle humour. For a moment Jones feels
uncomfortable and wishes he could retract.
"Make up for Cromwell, could I?" repeats Wilson, with his eye
still on the trembling Jones. "Hum! What was he like?"
"He was about your height," replies Jones, nervously, "and
aboutyour build—and"
"With a bottle-nose and a wart on it; hey?" asks W. B., sternly.
"Oh dear no," Jones hastens to explain: "that was a later
Cromwell. The Cromwell I mean for you is when he was younger,
and handsome, and manly-looking."
"Ah," returns W. B., mollified. "but that isn't the Cromwell the
public expect. No—it won't do. Then suddenly, "Still—you're
right—the period hasn't been done for a long time. Couldn't I play
a sort of Prince Rupert, eh ?—escaping—rescuing"
Jones saw it in a second. "My dear Barrett, you'd make a
first-rate Prince Rupert. Just the height, and the build, and"
So they set to work, and Henry Author, oddly enough, found
some notes by him for a Cavalier play of this sort, and as it wasn't
quite what W. B. required, the latter very kindly offered to put it
into dramatic form, and to work it up with a few strong situations
that had occurred to him some time ago. So this is how The Lord
Harry came to be written, and to be played; at least the above is
not an improbable account of how it might have happened.
Lord Marry is a thoroughly interesting play for three out of five
the house—though, indeed, he did once try to do this by blazing
away at a house-top—but Miss Eastlake; though, somehow or
other, he didn't wound more than her feelings, as she soon recovers,
and is all right for the finish.
Miss Eastlake, who was suffering from severe injury to her in-
step when I saw her, has never appeared to greater advantage than
as Esther Breane in this piece. She acts with great earnestness,
and whatever success the piece may
achieve will be mainly due to her and
Mr. W el laud, for, except to be dashing,
to escape, to rescue, to make irritatingly
long speeches just at critical moments,
when "deeds, not words," are peremp-
torily demanded, and to be called a
"rash, silly boy" (boyhood evidently
lasted over a considerable period in the
time of Cromwell), Mr. Wilson Bar-
rett has no lights and shades of cha-
racter to delineate. Perhaps as a "rash,
silly boy," he may yet be a formidable
rival to Mr. Henry Neville; but, as it is
not the cowl that makes the Monk, nor
the chimney-pot the situation, so it is not
the open, expansive turn-down collar
which can make either Lord Harry or
Lord Hamlet into the "rash, silly boy,"
whose reckless gallantry is to win the
men and charm the women.
The dull part of the play is that occu-
pied by the Shakspearian Clowns, Tribu-
lation and Gilead Tyzack, who are more
wearisome than the two Gobbos. Poor
Mr. George Barrett occasionally has a
bit of modern slang, such as "I'm not
quite so sure about that," introduced just to enliven his part; but
it doesn't do much.
Mr. Charles Coote is a complete transformation as Shekeniah
Pank: a very clever performance. Miss Lottie Venne is lost among
the Shakspearian Clowns, but has one or two good little bits with
Miss Eastlaxe.
The interiors in Zoyland Castle are most effectively painted, (with
the one exception of a front-scene staircase,) by Mr. Hall: Hall-
marked and Hall right; but oddly enough the Hall in Zoyland Castle
is painted by Mr. Hann, whose scenes are excellent.
There is one thing which, I would respectfully suggest to the talented
Authors, should be omitted, and that is the prayer on the house-top.
All of us are aware that the roof is only an ingenious bit of carpentry,
that the floods are merely canvass and gauze, cleverly painted by
Mr. Hann, and as the audience is certain that Miss Eastlake is in no
real danger, as, in fact, everybody knows that the whole lot of them
are '' merely pertendin'," it does grate upon a good many of them— and
the majority of theatre-goers are not stupidly squeamish on such
matters—to hear Miss Eastlake, when spread out upon the roof, and
looking up to the sky-borders, commence a prayer with a fervid
appeal to Him who walked upon the waters," and so forth (I cannot
recall the exact words) to help her in her sore distress.
The prayer fills up an interval while the Lord Harry W. Barrett is
f etchin^the wounded Colonel Clynds from the garret. As the action
is arranged, if it were not for this speech, there would be an awkward

Acts, and then, to my thinking, the business of the one great sensa-
tional scene is too pantomimic ever to be taken seriously.
Mr. Willard is excellent as the Puritan Captain, with a touch
now and then of the old familiar wicked-Masher-swagger as he
makes an exit, is always taking pot-shots at Lord Harry Wilson
Barrett, and invariably missing him, finally bringing down, not

"Hash, Silly Boy!"

so let me see—what could I do ?-—Sing ?—no, I couldn't sing,—but
I might pray for help. It's the sort o' thing a strictly brought-up
Puritan girl would do in such a difficulty as this, you know,—she'd
be sure to pray for help, wouldn't she?'' Whereupon the Authors
admitted she was right, and Henry Author Jones went home, and
next day came back with the prayer, whereat everyone was delighted
and thought it just the very thing for the situation,—which I don't,
and, unless I am much mistaken, the public doesn't either.
The play is well worth seeing, but whether it is equally worth
hearing I should hesitate to affirm. Let the interest of the sensation
scene be intensified, the action modified, the prayer omitted, and
then the piece will, I feel certain, please the general public, who, I
think, are not unfairly represented by
Penn Nibbs, the Puritan.
Congratulations.

Is proud of being singled out for Socialist attack;
And also from his memory will never be effaced

Which shall it be? The fair Morlkena's feet,
Nimble and neat,
Trip most enticingly in one direction.
The choice demands considerate circumspec-

And Madame Josephine,
Lithe, though a little lean,
Is a danseuse who's not to be derided.
Yet this new pirouettist who has glided,
Like a new planet, into people's ken,
Stirs every tongue and pen.
Her style is new, her steps are novel, very.

So swift as hers have scarce been seen since
Cerito's.
How they do twinkle! 'Tis a most entrancing
Although a rather risquS style of dancing.
Will he, the elderly vet alert Apollo,
Decide to follow
Her fascinating footing "all the way,"
As rival 'bus-touts say?
Maturer Madame Josephine, who lately
Was thought a daring dasher, more sedately
Moves than of yore, less Nautohily in faot,
With pacings less exuberant, more exact.
She does not "take the floor," as once was

With the brisk confidence of a bright Colleen,
Quite ready for th« liveliest Irish jig
That ever scandalised slow-footed Whig.
"The Kerry dancing," wild with Celtic joy,
Pathetically piped of by Mollot,
Seem less to lure her now, less stir to
pleasure,
Than native rustic measure
By "aught of oaten stop or pastoral quill,"
As Milton puts it, set to Jack and Jill
On English greens.
The second of the saltatory queens,
Morleena, seems "more Irish, and less nice,"
Less prejudiced, more plastic
In her selection for the light fantastic."
The rival ohanners pose and pirouette,
Wooing his favour who appears not yet
Definitively to have made his choice.
Which, which will win his voice?
WHO'S TO FILL ITP
With a view to there being no doubt, in
future, as to the efficient discharge of his
duties by the New Commissioner of Police,
it is understood that the Authorities have
determined,
(1.) That the appointment shall be given
only to a distinguished General Officer, who
has held an important command in not less
than three Campaigns;
(2.) That he will be expected to be well up
in the names of all the back-streets of the
Metropolis, and able to repeat off-hand the
printed list of fares from any given Cab-
stand within a six-mile radius from Charing
Cross;
(3.) That he shall, even when off duty,
wear a full-dress uniform, consisting of a
policeman's tunic, life-guardsman's breast-
plate, silver laoed oooked-hat, surmounted
with plume of ostrich-feathers, and carry
four loaded revolvers in his belt.
(4.) That he shall never, under any cir-
cumstances, appear in public exoept on
horsebaok.
(5.) That he shall be capable of assuming
any disguise at ten minutes' notice, and, 3
called upon to do it, give colourable imita-
tions of all the popular Actors of the day,
and other well-known leading characters.
And, lastly, that in seasons of apprehended
tumult he shall place himself, en ividence, in
the middle of the crowd, at the head of a
full military band, accompanied by a couple
of Magistrates, reading the Riot Aet, and keep
the Home Secretary duly apprised of his move-
ments by telegraph every quarter of an hour.
Poor Canterbury Pilgrims "in a Wale."
—The Canterbury Board of Guardians, (so it
was reported) after a little discussion, have
determined, with a conscientious regard to pa-
rochial economy, on placingthe paupers in their
Union on half-rations of tobacco. Can this
statement be correct? If so, the Canter-
bury Board of Guardians must be regular
"screws "—of tobacco. A knotty hard Board
this at Canterbury, and one that ought to be

THE DANCING MAN.

SUGGESTIONS FOR NEW RULES.
Sir,—I am not one of the Elected, but an Elector. (By-thc-way, i am not up
in history, but what a wonderful place Hanover must have been with only one
Elector!!) I think that the work of a Member of Parliament ought to override all
other considerations whatsoever.
If a barrister or business man can give his time to getting himself elected,
which involves temporary neglect of duties, let him devote his whole day
when he becomes a Member to the service of his country. Nothing less is
expected of him, and with nothing less should his constituents be satisfied.
It is because the House of Commons came gradually to be looked upon as " the
pleasantest Club in the world," that the business of the country has suffered.
"Business first, pleasure afterwards," seems to have been the motto of most
M.P.'s, who went to their day's work from ten or eleven till four, and then
strolled down to the House as they would to their Club.
No consideration should be made for the "private business " of Members. If
a Stockbroker is elected M.P., let him get a partner who will do the Stockbroking
business; and so for a Drysalter, or a Brewer, or a Small-Coal-and-'Tatur-man,
or whatever may be the nature of the business or profession of any Member. Were
this insisted on, then we should have the work of the House done within reason-
able hours, as thus:—Committees, 10'30 to 12"30; two hours allowed for recrea-
tion and refreshment, 2"30 to 7 for work, 7 to 9"30 for further recreation and
refreshment, and then from 9"30 to ll-30 for Question and Answer time and
Notices, or anything that was merely mechanical. At ll-30, "Who goes home?"
and everyone in bed by 12'30. To ascertain every night that this last regulation
had been duly complied with, special officers should be told off to various
districts, who should inquire at the houses of the Members residing or lodging
there, and receive positive assurance of the M.P.'s having retired to rest for the
night at the proper time. Saturday and Sunday must be "off-nights." Every
Member at the commencement of every Sessidn, should swear or affirm solemnly,
that he will faithfully and strictly observe all the Rules which are to guide his
conduct both in and out of the House.
The above are my own original notions. I enclose my card; and assuring you
that I haven't another up my sleeve, I am Yours truly,
One in a Thousand.

better for everybody. If the Lord Mayor's Show has to go with tie rest, by all means let it
go, and let the only exceptions be State Pageants.
The Liberty conceded has been converted into a tyranny, and the First Day of the week,
set apart for rest and quiet, is made hideous by shouting Salvationists with discordant bands
and tambourine-players. If these so-called religious processions be permitted, why should
not the votaries of any other form of worship have their processions as well? The spirit of
toleration has produced intolerance: liberty has come to be interpreted as the triumph of noise
and numbers; and the figure of Liberty herself will soon be seen tied and bound as she was in
the terrible days of the Commune in Paris. It is Liberty thus misunderstood that disgusts true

SSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FEOM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Feb. 22.—"Our object is to save
time," said Gladstone, impressively; in pursuance of which object
he proceeded at nearly half an hour's length to move the appoint-
ment of a Committee that was not opposed.
"We certainly want Reform of Procedure," said Tim Healy,
"but, like Charity, it should begin at home,—that is to say, on the
Treasury Bench. Look at Chtxders last week, taking half an hour
to tell the House he had appointed a Committee of Inquiry into the
Riots, and here's Gladstone now appropriating only a little less to
move the appointment of Committee to take into consideration Reso-
lutions of Opposition. If he'd been going to refuse consideration of
Conservative scheme, might have found it necessary to make speech.
But when agreeing to consider
them, why this wasted twenty
minutes? And then they talk of
us obstructing business!"
Good deal in what Tim says, as,
indeed, there generally is.

formed House that one of the first
things he did after taking the
Oath was to endeavour to obtain
Copy of the Rules. Told there
were none available. Further
informed he might go to book-
seller, and buy a copy. "But,"
said the gallant Captain, drawing
himself to his full height, "I
declined to do so;" at which
ringing cheers went up from the
New Members. A pretty pass Enthui-i.istic Reception of
) indeed we've come to if we are to go and spend sevenpence or eight-
pence of our own money upon Copy of the Rules and Orders of the
House! Wanting us to bring our own soap to the lavatory next. Fact
is, Treasury does too little for Members. In some countries they
have a pass over ali the Railways. At least not too muoh to ask that
Members shall have free pass over Metropolitan District Railway
during the Session. Professor Hunter, when he's finished Burmah,
will look to this.
Randolph away to-night. Attracted to Belfast, where there is
promise of Orange row. Sir Thomas Webster, with shocked face,
asked House how it oan consider question of Burmah in absence of
Randolph? Proposes Adjournment. House laughs. Webster,
abashed, takes back seat, and debate prooeeds.
Business done.—Committee on Procedure agreed to. Indian Con-
tribution to cost of Burmah War approved. Supply.
Tuesday.—" Chance of a Count Out to-night?" I asked Arnold
Morlet.
"CountOut!" he growled: "did
you ever hear of a company of first-
nighters at a successful play count-
ing-out the House?! Don't believe
there '11 be a Count Out this Ses-
sion. New Members not quite
sure that there will be a second
Session for them; determined to
make the most of their opportuni-
ties. They come early, and make
up for it by going away late.
They fill the Smoking - room,
swarm in the Reading-room, and
swamp the Dining-room. Believe

Library. As one said the other
night, 'Jee suriz and j'ee rest.'
No, tnere '11 be no Count Out to-
night."
Nor was there. Tried once, but
New Members came swarming in
by fifties, and no further attempt
was made. Their delight in the
place unbounded. Nobody a bore
to them. To-night, McKenna,
for the first time, delivered unin-
terruptedly that Speech about the
inequality of Imperial Taxation
in Ireland. Many years since he
first began to recite it. Beard

and moustache grown blue-blacker than ever in effort. Old House used to roar
at him. Sir Pat O'Brien in particular personally resented the speech. To-
night Sir Joseph went on like a flowing river, enjoying himself, and the cause
of enjoyment in others.
"I think," he said, as he gathered up his papers, "that will settle the question
as to who is to be Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Home Rule Parliament."
Esmonde rose to second Motion. In doing so he said, " I wish to make a few
remarks on the character of the National Debt of Ire-
land." A year ago this proposition would have been
received with a howl of despair. New Members licked
their lips over prospect, settled themselves down com-
fortably in their seats, and a smile of pleased content
illuminated the House when Esmonde, with thick roll
of notes in hand, began at 1794. Serjeant Simon
looked on with melancholy aspect. He remembered the
time when he had proposed to describe the Constitution
of Jamaica a hundred and two years ago, and House
incontinently yelled him down.
Perhaps most remarkable case that of Sir George
Campbell. Sir George who, after all, is a humorist,
had taken McKenna's Resolution bodily, and moved,
as an Amendment, to substitute Scotland for
Ireland. A year ago the House would have
emptied at first sound of his melodious voice.
To-night New Members sat delightedly at feet
of Sir Georgr (who said his motive was to
"bring out the facts of the case") indig-
nantly cried "Order!" when some old Member
seized the opportunity to enter into private con-
versation, and remained in rapt attention to the
end.
"Don't know what you think, Toby," Sir
George said, after it was over. "But it seems
to me that this is the best and most intelligent
House of Commons of recent times."
Business done.—Nothing particular.
Wednesday.—Curious scene in House this afternoon. Crilly brought in
measure called Town-House Ireland Bill. Didn't hear his speech myse If, but
Gorst tells mo objects of Bill are that every agricultural labourer in Ireland
having in the first case been provided with three acres and a cow, is to have
allotted to him a town-house, where he may spend a few months every season.
Gladstone on his legs, neither approving nor disapproving Bill—just making a
speech. Suddenly a quick movement went through the House. AU eyes turned
towards the door, and there was beheld Randolph fresh from inspiring Ulster.
As he passed the serried ranks of Parnellites drawn up in support of the Crilly -
willy—Every-Man-his-own-Town-House-Bill, a crooning noise, sometimes rising
to a howl, went up.
"He'8 dead tons, let's wake him," said Joseph Gillis, feeling in all his
pockets to see if perchance he had a candle-end; and they did, filling the house
with mournful wail.
Randolph bore up bravely, supporting himself by holding on to his mous-
tache, as he walked past the mob. But reception cut him to the heart.
"It's not tha shouting I mind, Toby," he said, as I seated myself by his side,
for I always liked Randolph; "it's the breaking of old associations. These are
mine own familiar friends, as another great man once said. I've heard the
chimes of midnight with them, held sweet converse with Joseph Gillis when he
used to sit behind me. I've plotted and planned with Tim Healy behind the
Speaker's Chair. I've lived with them, and loved them, and they have trusted
me. And now, see by what slight;bonds we were held together! But yester-
day they cheered me when I rose. To-day they jeer me. as I pass." And
Randolph fairly broke down. Business done.—Every-Man-his-own-Town-
House-Bill referred to Seleot Committee.
Thursday.—" Who ordered Canadian Medals?" asked Cremer. "Not I,"
said Henry Fowler, Secretary to the Treasury. "Not I," said W. H. Smith,
late Colonial Secretary. "'Spects they growed," said the Sage of Queen's
Anne's Gate, sarcastically. But there they were, and some one had to pay for
them. It appears that Medal ordered to be struck to commemorate gallant
conduct of Canadian Volunteers in connection with Riel Rebellion. Canadian
Government presented it not only to Volunteers who had been in service, but
to those who stopped at home, and then invited British tax-payer to meet the
charges. Ince proposed compromise—"Let Great Britain and Ireland pay for
the item, Ribbon £30, and melt down the silver of the medals." Vote finally
agreed to, but nobody owned up to having given the order.
Parnellites still keep pegging away at Randolph. He has shocked them in
their finest feelings. What they can't a-bear is a man who goes to Ireland and
makes inflammatory speeches. ^Randolph gave mortal offenoe in this direction.
Went to Belfast, and swore by 'igh 'eaven that the Orangemen's rights were
worth fighting for. Joseph Gtllis so shocked at this that he remains speech-
less. Sexton, overcoming his emotion, gives notice of a Resolution "particu-
larly regretting and condemning language designed to intimidate the House,
and to incite bodies of persons in Ireland to the use of arms." That is a thing
the Land-Leaguere never will stand, and they mean to take it out of the blame-
less Rando'lph. Business done— Supply; Crofters' Bill brought in.
Friday.—Quiet night, though fringe of Irish Question was touched by refer-
ence to the case of David McGaw. David, it appears, has telegraph-pole
growing in his back garden. Postal Authorities want to
remove it. David demands compensation. Post Office
refuse it. Country-side a-flame with excitement. David
McGaw sits up all night with his telegraph-post, and
swears it shall be dragged out of garden only over his
dead body. Attention of High Court of Parliament very
properly drawn to circumstance which may oonceal the
germs of revolution.
Long debate on Riots. General Goldsworthy gives
delightful account of his personal experiences. Heard of
crowd in Trafalgar Square. Went down to see what
was the matter; listened to speeches; followed the Mob
into Piccadilly. Near Aohilles Statue warned to go
away, Mob thinking him policeman in disguise. "The
General dies, but never retreats." Pressed forward,
seized by a dozen men, who put their hands in his
pockets, then knocked him down. "The men didn't look
as if they were starving," the General confided to the
Speaker. They were, on the contrary, well fed.
"But," he added, with an air of conviction, "they wore
a very criminal aspect." Business done.—Not much.
ELECTEIFYING CAPTAIN SHAW.
Mr. Carpenter, lecturing the other day on "Fire
Alarms," is reported, by the Daily Newt, to have said:—
"At the central offices of the Salvage Corps, too, wonderful
things were done in the way of alacrity. Here the men slept in
their under garments, and upon the bed were their trousers, which
were sewn inside their boots. The bedclothes were attached to
a wire, and at the first alarm were violently pulled off. At the
same time a trap opened in the floor, and the men while putting
on their trousers slid down an inclined plane into a vehicle below.
Altogether it took them 13 J seconds to get out of the building fully
equipped. Mr. Carpenter also described the self-acting fire
alarms, which send a warning message directly the apparatus geta
heated, and he pointed out that a practical testimony to then-
value lav in the fact that factories which employed them were
insured oy the fire offices at from one-half to one-third of the
ordinary rates."
On this our own Eleotrician begs to make the following
piotorial suggestions to our Chief Fire-man—

REAL TURTLES AND MOCK.
The Real is at tho Lyceum; the Mock is at Toole's. For reasons
which will be more or less obvious even to the humorous critic of
the Athenaeum, we cannot venture upon an
analysis of the original Play, nor of the
original Travesty. It is a skit on the Ly-
ceum piece by Mr. Wills, and not in any
sort of way a burlesque on Faust by Mr.
Goethe. Mr. J. L. Toole as Mephistool-
pheles keeps up the steam, and his conjuring
and playing with fire is something that asto-
nishes even himself.
Herr Toole's command of the
German language is stupendous,
and represents years of study,
nnd probably a residence ameng
Cousins-German. The delicate
humour of Miss Marie Linden's
Marguerite will be thoroughly ap-
preciated by all who have seen
Miss Ellen "Terry in the original.
We are glad to say that Miss
Tkrry has quite recovered—we
were afraid she would catch cold
in that undressing for bed scene
and resumed the part last Satur-
day night. Mr. Shelton, as
Marguerite'1'$ Mother, shows a
great deal of dry humour, and
both in this and in Going It he
js very good. Brother Valentine
Brunton is funny when electrified after the combat. The Scenery,
which involves changes almost too heavy for this little stage, is
remarkably effective, specially the
change from the Regentstrasse to
what it ought to be, and from
A Street to the Crystal Palace by
night, which last, when we were
there, was received with great
applause. Mr. Warde's panto-
mime leap is a marvel of agility,
and his imitation of Henry Ir-
ving is peculiarly happy. Tho
great merit of the singing at this
Home of Lyric drama is distinct
articulation.
There is an occasional struggle
between the voices on the stage
and an enthusiastic cornet under-
neath it, but Mr. Fitzgerald.

A CARILLON OUT OF TUNE.
Shades of Ladlache and Lumley! Never before was suoh a soene
witnessed in Her Majesty's Theatre as that of last Saturday night,
when the carpenters, having struck one scene, struck themselves,
and the curtain rising showed a lot of ill-clad men, who extended
their hands for largesse, and then scrambled for coppers thrown to
them by the audience. There were shouts for M. Carillon, the
Manager; but to appear before the infuriated audience did not chime
in with M. Carillon's idea of the fitness of things. Had he shown
himself, he would have caught it from everyone; as the French say.
"d doiMe carillon." Poor Italian Opera! with such a capital and
picturesque ifephistopKelts as M. Vidal too! There was a good
future in store for this venture, if the speculator could only have
tided over the first fortnight. Well, it was started by a Carillon,
and it ended with a carillon,—and such a carillon as we hope will
not again be heard within the walls of Her Majesty's Theatre.
Between a leading Actress and the Committee of the Theatre
Francois there now exists " a Dudlay Feud."
A FRENCH AMLET.
Sir,—They've been adapting from the English. Messrs. Sanson
and Cressonois have been doing Shakspeare for Sarah B., cooking
him up as if it were Omelette instead of Hamlet. I am the more
annoyed at this because I had already got my own version ready for
Paris, and I flatter myself that none but an Englishman can really
translate the Divine Williams. I'm obliged to give 'em a rhyme
in, now and then, as the French like their tragedies'" in verse. We
only do our burlesques that way. Some of my rhythmio lines are
absolutely classic in their rigid correctness. A. S.
Thrift, thrift, Hokatio! The funeral baked meats

The above, you see, adds a physical explanation, and intensifies
the connection between mind and matter.
Then again, when Amlet meets these same young friends "sur
l'estrade," and discusses with them the temperature, the conversa-
tion continues—
Ham. The air bites shrewdly. It is very cold. &c, &c.
Whioh I give thus:—
Am. L'air mord avee beaucoup de finesse. Tres froid il fait.
Hor. C'est un air qui se sert des pinces, et tres empresse.

Hor. Qu'il manque de douze, je crois.

Am. Ou allez-vous me conduire? Parlez: je n'irai pas plus loin.

You see how I work the rhymes. Then the Ghost continues—
Le Fant&me. Mon heure est presque arrive quand, il n'est pas une fable,
A des flammes je vais me rendre!
Am. Sapristi! Pauvre diable!
This I think thoroughly French, while preserving the true Shak-
spearian spirit.
But I will not continue my extracts, contenting myself with only
one more passage. It is where Le Fantome describes the method of
his destruction. I furnish it below :—
Ham. Haste me to know't, that I with wings as swift
As meditation, or the thoughts of lore, &c, &c.
• • * • •
Ham. 0 my prophetic soul!
My uncle!
This portion of dialogue is rendered, as I venture to think,
admirably, thus:—
Am. Faites hate que ie le sache, qu'avec ailes aussi vites
Que meditation, ou les pens£es d amour—
Le Fantdme. Yous dites?
Am. Je puis balayer jusqu'a ma revanche
Et la difficulte a un coup je tranche.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
'TEMPORA MUTANTUR."
Afteb, our visit to Oxford for the opening of the Town Theatre, by
the 0. U. D. S., we, Squibbs and myself, were delighted to accept an
invitation for one of the usual performances of the A. D. C., at
Cambridge, in their own private Theatre, which forms a part of their
Club House.
"You couldn't," I said to Squtbbs. "You couldn't have abetter
cicerone for Cambridge, than myself, as I know every inch of the
place."
We travelled down by the King's Cross Line (" In former times,"
I was careful to inform my companion, "we went by the Eastern
Counties," and miserable it was), and arrived in an hour and
twenty minutes. Our destination was the "Bull Inn," I beg its
pardon, I mean Hotel, which was once the swell hostelrie. It may be
so now for aught I know; only, if it is, I could suggest a few improve-
ments which would be very much to tne Bull's advantage. However,
this by the way, just one in the Bull's-eye, as a mem.
"The place is considerably changed since my last visit," I observe
to Squibbs. I am a little uncertain when my last visit was, but
anyhow I know it was some considerable time ago, and I seem to
feel that the town has taken an unfair advantage of my absence, to
alter itself and grow considerably. And, bless me! here's a Tramway.
Where are we?" asks SQTrrBBS, as we drive round the corner into
something between a High Street
and a High Road, ornamented with
second-rate modern villas.
"Well, really," I am compelled
to state, not yet having got over the
shock given me by the sight of the
Tramway; "well, really, Squtbbs,
I—confess—I—I don't remember
what the name of this road
is; I know that further on
we come to Emmanuel Col-
lege,"—I don't see anything
like it at present,— "and
then on the left there's
Downing College—at least,
there was Downing." I add
this because I have
some sort of idea that
Downing was abolish-
ed years ago by tho
University Commis-
sion. Fortunately
Squtbbs is not of an
inquisitive nature:
he waits for me to
supply him with in-
formation. The fly-
man takes a sudden
turn to the right, wo
Sass through small surburban streets, with the usual suburban semi-
etached cottage residences, and two-penn'orth of garden in front.
"The great difference between Oxford and Cambridge," I have
previously informed Squibbs, "is, that, at Cambridge, you suddenly
tind yourself in the midst of all the Colleges at once."
"I say," says Squibbs, after peering through the glass, "I don't
see any Colleges."
"No," I am bound to reply, "no more do I." (Hang it! they
can't have moved the Colleges in order to improve the streets!)
"But," I add, hopefully, "we shall come upon them soon." Yet if
the flyman perversely chooses a line of bye-lanes, we may drive up
to the Bull without having seen a single sign of the University.
And as yet not one person, old or young, in cap and gown. Very
annoying: bad Stage management, so to speak, on the part of the
Authorities. How can parents or guardians or visitors be impressed
with a place unless, immediately on their arrival, they see the
Colleges and the Students? If they can't have real Undergraduates,
they should pay "supers " to walk about in caps and gowns, reading
books. At present, and, as far as we've gone, this might be any
little provincial town of no particular importance.
At last we round a corner into Trumpington Street. Aha! I
remember this. Stop, though! Is it Trumpington Street or Trump-
ington Road? or, on second thoughts, isn't it some street, called after
some College, of which Trumpington Road is a continuation? As I
nan't recall the details, I tell Squibbs that we are in Trumpington
Road or Street (which is near enough for him—he doesn't seem to
care much), and I beg him to keep his eyes open for the Colleges
everywhere. "Here, Squtbbs!" I shout to him, "on the left!—
look!" It is a huge building.
"What's that?" asks Squibbs, admiring it. I would give a trifle
at this moment to be able to state with accuracy the name of this big
building. I've clean forgotten it. I know it isn't a College—I

1864, of one of the present Parliamentary Whips.
Only a bud then, now a full-blown Fl-w-r.

Then, looking out
And it may be, for aught I can recollect.
"Very grand!" says Squibbs. approvingly,
on the right, he asks, "What's this?"
"That's a College," I answer.
"Yes, I see," returns Squibbs; "but what College?"
"Well," I reply, scrutinising it as thoroughly as I can in passing,
a process which doesn't assist my memory in the least, " I forget
exactly; but it's either St. Margaret's or Christ's,—no, I think
it's Sidney Sussex." Be-
fore I can make up my
mind as to what it is, I see
Peter house on the left.
"This," I say with pride
at being right at last—" is
Peterhouse."
But no sooner have I as
it were staked my reputa-
tion on my identification of
Peterhouse, than I see there
is another College next to
it, which, it suddenly occurs
to me, is the real Peter-
house. But if so, what was
the other? However, we
pass with such panorama-
like rapidity that Squibbs
hasn't time to catch more
than a glimpse of anything.
Suddenly ne asks me,
"What, s that? " pointing
to a building on our left.
".Oh," I say, recognising
it at once, "I was wrong
when I said that big build-
ing we passed was the
Library,—this is the Library

Araminta's Dressing-Room. View of Ar»-
minta returning to costume of private life.
and no Booner have I committed
Clarendon."
It is very strange. I thought I knew every inch of the ground,
but up to now I haven't recalled correctly the name of any single
College. Now suppose I had been a Claimant? What would my
ignorance have suggested? Why certainly it would have suggested
j ust what must have already occurred
to Squibbs—whose manner is becom-
ing distrustful—that I have never
been to Cambridge before in all my
life. However, I know that when 1
get within sight of King's and
Trinity Street, I shall be all, so to
speak, at home. "My foot will be

course of the evening I get friends
to refresh my memory, and I find
that what we passed were the Fitz -
william ("The Fitzwilliam, of

course! fancy forgetting that.'"),
Adenbrook Hospital ("Ah, of
course
house,
'), Pembroke College, Peter-
'Cat's," and the Pitt Press
(" Pitt Press! dear me! how ridicu-
lous to have forgotten that ! "), and
Christ's—oh yes, that I remembered.]
We deposit our bags at the Bull,

givingon the subject, and I try to recall what College it is that opens
on to Trinity Street, Trinity Hall or Cains? However, I keep these
uncertainties to myself, and tell Squtbbs that this small College is
Trinity Hall, and the next one to it is—well, I forget exactly—and

"Bishop's Hostel" (so kind of them to have this written up), then
through New Court, which I don't remember is " New Court," but
am only certain it isn't Neville's, where we are now, in the Cloisters,
and I am explaining the topography.
"But there doesn t seem anyone about!" objects Squtbbs, discon-
tentedly. Squibbs always wants a crowd and colour, for effect. He
had evidently expected rioting and merriment, and young men in
caps and gowns, and old Dons in academicals, and men with silver
pokers, and the whole place astir, instead of such a City of the Dead
as the College I said was Trinity Hall was when we looked in, and as
Neville's Court Trinity is at this moment.
: I own I can't understand it. Have I made a mistake? Isn't it

"Thi* is the place where they wait for their Call, | Which serves them for Dressing-room, Green-room, and all.1
Term time? Are all the men down? ""Were Missis's party last
Toosday?" Or have I misread my invitation, which may have
been for next term?
Here is the Hall. Here„are the butteries. Ah! signs of life. A
dinner is just commencing in hall. Not many men at it. Several
hurrying in. Now Squibbs is satisfied: he has seen real live youths
in real caps and gowns—and there are a lot of them—flying in like
sparrows at feeding-time.
But our own dinner-time is approaching, so I take Squtbbs through
Trinity Quad, and then I point out to him Little Trinity, "which
didn't exist in my time," I tell him; and, with an air of sadness
tinged with annoyance at their having taken such confounded liberties
with the place directly after I haa quitted the scene, and having
actually gone so far as to destroy the very house in which I first had
rooms—though perhaps as they've built a portion of Little Trinity
on this site, I might take it as a sort of complimentary memorial—
I walk him towards Bridge Street, show him the exteriorof John's, and
then am myself suddenly startled by Squibbs drawing my attention to
the Round Church, the existence of which I had entirely forgotten.
"Come along, Squtbbs," I say; and telling him that we '11 see Mag-
dalen and the other Colleges to-morrow, we pass through Green Street,
where I recognise some more old rooms, and wonder now many have
lived there since, and who is "keeping" there at this minute—and
then we turn round by Rose Crescent, have a look at the Home of
Immortal Bacon (the Cambridge Tobacconist, who, if true to his
name, ought only to have dealt in "pig-tail "1, and across the
market-place to our temporary residence, which, after all my
lionising, is the "Bull."
Dress; and dinner with the Master of Scroope Hall—who is a Clarke
not in Orders, unless theatrical ones, having been the guide, philo-
sopher, and friend of the A. D. C. and the energetic patron of every-
thing dramatic in the University for ever so many years. Then to the
entrance of the Club-House. It is somewhat dark and mysterious.
We pass several stalwart policemen (" in my day, Squibbs, there
were no policemen"), we proceed under an awning where there is a
mysterious man holding a light (" we kept it quite dark in our time,
Squibbs, on account of the Proctors "), and then up the staircase.
"Here are the old rooms, Squibbs; here are all the portraits of cele-
brated A. D. C. actors, groups, and scenes, dating back to the first
performances in the May term of 1855." On the walls I point out
portraits of distinguished bandits, magistrates, comic men m farces,
serious heroes in tragedies, and also lovely heroines, coquettish
maidens, and pert chambermaids, who have since become Judges,
Bishops, Cabinet Ministers, Attorney-Generals, Colonial Governors,
scientific Soldiers, Authors, Actors, Bankers, Merchants—in fact, all
sorts and conditions of men.
Ladies are admitted every and any night among the audience (" It
was not so in our time, Squtbbs." and I bewail the departure from
ancient tradition), but no ladies nave as yet trod these classic boards,
as the A. D. C. still clings to the practice in the time of Shakspeake
whose heroines were beardless youths. The plays on the occasion
of our present visit are, I find, an old-fashioned farce, and the
Courier of Lyons, the latter specially arranged for men only; so
that, except in the farce, the female representatives hadn't a chance.
This again is a matter of regret, as the plot of the drama suffered
by the alterations, and the ladies in the first farce, specially Araminta,
were remarkably good.
Squibbs is delighted with the scenery, which merits all the praise
he bestows on it. We visit the Green-room, which serves as the common
dressing-room for Stars
and Supers alike; and we
are invited to see the
"Ladies' dressing-rooms,"
where we are welcomed by
Aramintat who is just put-
ting on his smoking-coat
and lighting a cigarette
preparatory to going up-
stairs into the Club-room.
The makes-up are very
artistic, and not overdone.
After the performance I
find myself giving my
opinion on the acting of
Choppard to the gentle-
man nimself, who on the
stage had appeared a most
desperate villain of over
fifty, but is now, as he
stands talking to me, a
most amiable and pleasant
youth of about twenty.
There were some very
good bits of character-
acting. Then the per-
formance being over' at a reasonable hour, we were hospitably
entertained at supper.1! At Oxford, where theatricals have still the
charm of freshness, the men were enthusiastic; but, at Cambridge,
the A. D. C. performances seem to be taken as part of the ordinary
routine. "You see,"the polite President of the Club explained," The
University
Greek Play has
rather taken it
out of us, and
then there's I
a Theatre open i /
in the town. ft
Miss Twenty- f{"
two, with her S
Company, is

Oh, indeed;
that explains a
good deal,
"And our bill
is only a re-
vival of an old
piece." Quite
so. Then he
takes us to sup-
per, which is
not by any
means the
worst part of
the evening's
entertainment,

Drinking a Toast.
Oxford fashion.
Cambridge fashion.
Squibbs and myself are both on in this scene: not
too much " on," of course, but" on " quite enough. The proceedings
are of a most orderly and pleasant character. There are no pipes,
few cigars, but plenty of cigarettes. "We have no idea of not going
home till morning, but, on the contrary, the sooner we are in bed at a
reasonable hour the better. Nothing can exceed their hospitality or
their politeness, but there is an absence of enthusiasm; it all seems,
whatever they do, a regular matter of course. The Master of Scroope
Hall, who walks home with us, explains that most of these men are in
for honours and the tripos, and the study of the Drama is not their
first consideration. "In my day, and for some time after," I tell
Squtbbs, "there used to be an immense excitement about the theatri-
cals. And such a rush for tickets! But then there was no theatre in
the town. Theatricals were tabooed, our dramatic pleasures were stolen
ones, our suppers were" but here we are at the Bull. We '11 re-
turn in the merry May. Tou '11 come back with your Nibbs.

I carst werry well flatter myself as I looks romantick, or that

But so it was

Me, that it went quite to my Hart, and I sed, scz I, without a stop-
ping a minnit to think wot I was about, " Can I be of any use, Miss r"
"Oh," she said, "if you wood only jest see me to the hend of the
nex street, I shood be so mutch hobhged."
"Like a bird. Miss," says I, more pleased than I ought to ha been,
but that's ony human natur, ewerything seems nicer the wronger it
i», as the Poet says.
So off we sets, wen, as bad luck wood have it, who shood I see but
the full blown wife of my buzzem a coming along the hother side of
the way! There wasn't a moment to loose, so I Bays, "Pleas send
the humbreller back," and I cuts down the nex court and into the
Otel like a rain dear and rushes up stares.
Presently cums a message to say as how as I was wanted, and my
fust glarnce at that hadmirabel woman's stern feeturs rewealed the
hole fatal secret, that I had bin seen with my fare companyon! For
wunce I was thrown hoff my gard, and in anser to the mild inquiry,
"Who was that young person," 1 sed boldly, one of my Neeces from
the country.
Further remarks was stopt by the arrival of company, and my wife
guv me a letter she had brort for me, and went. The blunders and
the muddles and the upsets as I made at that there Brekfast I shall
never forget. I was reglar dazed. I hadn't done nothink speshal
rong if I d ha stuck to the truth. But then I know'd werry well
that She woodn't have bleeved me, whereas she mite beleeve my
hinwenshun, as I appens to have quite a shoal of Neeces in the
country. I was a puzzlin myself to make up quite a lot of other
hinwenshuns to suit the fust wun, wen, to my intense estonishment
I was told as a bootyful yung Lady in a cab wanted to see me, and
rushing down stares hedlong to see who it was, there was my morn-
ing's companion, a larfing as usual, and she says, says she, "I've
brort back your butiful humbreller with many thanks."
And then a brilliant thort flashed across my pore bewildered brane,
and I says, "Miss," says I, "I've got into sitch a hawful scrape by
bein seen with you this morning."
"Lor! what fun!" says she. "Tell mo all about it."
So I told her. But the more I told her, the more she larfed, and
kep saying, "How awful jolly!"
But," Bez I, "what on airth am I to do?"
"I know," sez she. "If you will tell me your name and address,
I '11 write you a letter of thanks, and sine it with your Neece's name.
Won't it be jolly to call you 'Dear Huncle!' and say I ham your
afecshunate Neece. By the bye, wot's my name to be?"
So I told her Sally Green; and then she larfed more merrier than
ever, and said as that wasn't a bit like her name. Then she wrote
it all down, and then she sed, "Now, Mr. Robert," says she, with
her butiful musickal, coaxing woice, "you was werry kind to me
this morning, and have made me werry merry this hevening: so, as
you have told me your name, I will tell you mine." And she told
me; and then she sed, "If hever you wants to go to a certain
Theater (as she menshuned, but I won't), cum to the Stage Dore
and harsk for me, and in you go like a bird! Good-bye!" she says,
shakin hands quite frendly, and away she drives hoff, leavin me
speechless with rapshur and estonishment.
The amount of charf as I had to stand that hevening from my
brother Waiters was sumthink hawful; but let them larf as wins,
says I, and I thinks, upon the hole, as I was a winner on that
ewentful day. The letter cum all right the nex morning, and I
have since awailed myself of my kind Neece's (!) inwitashun to go
to the Theater, free gratis, and hev been introdoosed to sum of my
bootyful Neeces' (!) bootyful frends, of the same sects, and they
have menny on em declared as I was a most emusing hold Buffer,
which I bleeves is sum term of theatrickle endearment, and they
hopes as they shall horf en see me'.
Well, now for the moral. I don't know as how as I have dun
anythink werry hawful wicked, but I do confess as that I never can

AFTER-DINNER APHORISMS AND OTHERISMS.
(By Curius Maximus.)
To err is human. A consistent man must be either a monster or a
Saint. As you cannot compliment a man on being a Saint, it follows
that to tell him he is entirely and invariably consistent, is to accuse
him of being a hard-hearted, inhuman monster—unless you explain
to him that his consistency is that of a jelly.
We use the word

, In old prize-fighting days, of which we have
recently been reminded, the term " maulies " was a slang expression
of the Ring signifying fists." It is a coincidence that the return to
power of the present Government, in which there are a lot of Morleys,
should have been signalised by mob-riots, street-rows, and hand-to-
hand encounters. It is no more than a coincidence; but still

Our Law is in a very mixed state, speoially in the Divorce Court.
But what oan you expect from a Court which is called the Admiralty,
Probate, and Divorce all in one? Of course an Admiralty Court
taking cognizance of Divorce must be quite at sea.
• • \
It is not unusual to hear that "the character of a man's private
life should not be allowed any weight in estimating his public value."
Sir Thomas More was a saintly man, plus being Lord Chancellor.
Yet no one would have chosen him for the office merely on account
of his piety. True. But if I catch a most learned and profes-
sionally upright Lord Chief Justice in the act of pocketing my silver
spoon (I have only one, and guard it myself—taking it up to bed with
me every night—but this is a detail), I should hand him over to a
policeman, and hale him before a Magistrate, not as a Chief Justice,
but as a common prig. If, on the evidence, he were convicted, would
he go to prison as a thief, and yet, at the same time, stay out to do
his work as Chief Justice, in which capacity, his character for up-
rightness and legal acumen has never been impeached? My answer
to this is, Yes—tfhe can be in two places at once. "I'm aware,"
said Major Malony, "that the fellow (his servant) is an awful
scoundrel in his private life, but he has the real secret of boot polish-
ing, and I can't part with him." It is Utility r. Morality. Major
Pendennis was of much the same opinion as to Mr. Morgan's
merits.
Excuse me if I say I do not, in these times, like to see an adver-
tisement headed, "The People's Palace." It sounds as if we were
preparing to weloome the reign of King Mob. Should that Tyrant
ever come among us, to " commune " with us, the Palace would soon
be wrecked; ana when law and order were onoe more restored, the New
Zealand visitor would regard the same, and exclaim, "Oh, then I see
King Mob hath been with you."

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, March 1.—Much curiosity-
displayed during sitting as to objects and accomplishments of
Wolff's pic-nio to the Pyramids. £12,500 asked on account of it,
together with a tidy sum for telegrams. Importunate Members
wanting to know all over the place. A good deal of talk, to which
Gladstone contributed long
speech, and Bofrke another, but
no one any the wiser. There was a
Mission, and its costs hare to be
paid. But what it was all about,
House, like little Peterkin on the
field of Blenheim, "never could
make out." Only suggestion is
that Mission has succeeded in rein-
troducing the Turk in Egypt, and,
as Pet eh R tlands says, it would,
on the whole, have been better to
give the Turk the £12,500 to stop
away.

Tuesday.—Public business did not commence to-night till twenty
minutes past Nine. Loud complaints of wasted Sitting. On the
contrary, believe the proceedings most useful. Full rehearsal of a
real Home Rule debate. Shows how it would be done, and who
would do it. Began on Motion to go into Committee on private Bill
dealing with the Main Drainage of Belfast. Sexton, in speech of
prodigious length, proposed to
engraft upon the Main Drainage
Bill a scheme for the assimilation
of the municipal and parliamen-
tary franchise, to permit all Elec-
tors to become candidates for
Aldermen, and to provide for a
few other things, what all this
had to do with the Main Drainage
not made clear in Sexton's tre-
mendous oration, nor in others
that followed. Courtney opposed
Amendment, and instantly drew
upon his modest and benevolent
head the fire of Irish indignation.
"What a skull to crack!" said
Mr. Clancet, instinctively feeling
for his shillelagh.
Tim Healt called him "a
wiseacre." Speaker on his feet
in a moment, sternly deprecating
the use of such language.
"Then I withdraw the wise-
acre," said Tim, meekly.
"Another good word gone!"
murmured Joseph Gillis from
a bark seat.
Efforts were made to connect
the Main Drainage Scheme with
Randolph. But the Speaker
could not see the connection, and
the effort failed. Repeated at-
tempts made to drag some of the Orange Members into the sewers.
But, though boiling with indignation, they looked with assumed
indifference upon Tim's coat-tails dragged slowly up and down
beneath their very noses. Harcourt couldn't resist temptation of
joining in so promising a fray, though what he had to do with the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Main Drainage1 Scheme of Belfast no one knew. Fire minutes to
Eight, Joseph Gillis came to judgment, and was received with
loud cheers hy the New Irish Members, who greatly reverence the
Patriarch. JosErninhis most judicial manner stated some "matters
of fack " that surprised even his countrymen; and having given sly
kick at Chairman of Committees, resumed his seat, generously grin-
ning. Nine o'Clock, debate flagged. Impossible to get up excite-
ment when no one would fight, so twenty minutes later Division
taken, and Questions usually opened at half-past Four, were taken.
All a prodigous joke, played
throughout with undisturbed gravity.
Parnellites talked a little about
Main Drainage, and a good deal about
the Franchise, and all the while had
their eye on Randolfh. The blame-
less and long-suffering Lord had
been cruelly attacked for, of all
things in the world, making an
inflammatory speech! He had chal-
lenged his assailant to bring the
matter to an issue. The Motion
stood far down on the paper. Could
be reached to-night only by extra-
ordinary dispatch of business.
Everything depended upon rapidity
with which earlier Motions dis-
missed. To have talked at large
upon one of the ordinary Motions
dealing with public business, would
have been a stale joke. To the
ingenious minds below the Gangway
occurred the idea of making play
with a Private Bill. Hence the
sudden interest in the Main Drain-
age of Belfast; hence the arguments
in favour of Assimilation of Muni-
cipal Franchise; hence the allusion
to Coubtnet as a wiseacre; and
Nook, and Corners of Parliament- J*11!*3 .the delay of five hours in
Commons Prayers. The Chaplain, beginning business. The Motion
relating to Lord Randolph was
never reached, and he still goes about weighed down by the accusa-
tion of having made an inflammatory speech.
Business done.—The Parnellites have a little game with Ran-
dolph.
Wednesday.—Curious how business instincts crop up at unex-
pected periods. Here's Mr. Nolan, who, before he was called upon
to take part in direction of imperial politics, followed the honourable
profession of Manager of an Aquarium. He was discussing
Labourers (Ireland) Bill; got along very well at first; but seeing
before him body of well-dressed gentlemen, presumably sufficiently
well off to treat themselves to a little pleasure excursion, if well
Slanned, he broke forth as follows:—" Twill undertake to take any
[ember of this House to the North of Ireland, and show him that
intolerance in its rankest form is practised by the Ulster Members."
Nolan about to proceed, doubtless with object of setting forth few
Particulars as to route to be taken, times of boat and train starting,
otel charges, and general expenses of this personally-conducted
expedition, when Speaker interposed. Kind-hearted man, averse
from interfering with any Member's private interest. But really
these kind of arrangements could not be made during the hours of
public business, and upon Motion for Second Reading of Labourers
(Ireland) Bill. Ex-Manager of Aquarium aooordingly changed
subject, with the more grace as he had issued his Advertisement.
Members desiring to avail themselves of the excursion would know
where to find him.
Business done.—Labourers (Ireland) Bill read Second Time.
Thursday.—Great attraction. First performance of The House
and the Holmes. Four-lined Whips out on either side. New
Members come down in large numbers and high spirits. Now's
their opportunity. Government met with what is practically Vote
of Want of Confidence. Those who made their maiden speech on the
Address will have fresh opportunity of impressing House and country.
Those who have not spoken before will speak to-night. Old Members
must be taught the power of new-comers.
Holmes moves a Resolution, the avowed object of which is to
improve social condition of Ireland by stopping supplies. Holmes
was Attorney-General in the late Government, but, owing to circum-
stances over which ho had no control, did not obtain opportunity of
making himself known to House. House knows him now, and won't
forget him. A poor, wandering, wobbling speech stretched far be-
yond an hour. A most remarkable voice, too. Mixed up, as it were,
with explosive material. Proceeds through some sentences in low
rapid, indistinct voice. Then suddenly two words, five words, or
occasionally ten words, go off with a loud explosion, after which
Holmes goes on in ordinary voice till more explosive words turn up,
and that so, again startled by sort of vocal fog-signals.
"Reminds me," said Treveltan, "of the Curious Case of Dr.
Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. You remember how Dr. Jekyl was some-
times startled by finding himself speaking in voice of Mr. Hyde t
There goes Mr. Hyde."
But it was only the explosive material turned up again, and
Holmes shouting at the top of his voice, "the ties which bound,"
the rest of the sentence running—" the people in Ireland were drawn
so tight as to risk snapping," being uttered in ordinary tones.
"It is a curious thing," said Earl Spencer to Lord Ashbourne,
with whom he sat chatting in the Peers' Gallery, "that Irish Attor-
ney-Generals always address the House at the top of their voice,
How is it, I wonder?"
"Do they?" said Lord Ashbourne. "I don't know another
ease; but I suppose it's because they have two audiences; one at
Westminster, and the other across the Channel. What seems shout-
ing at Westminster, is only a faint whisper at Dublin."
Business done.—Vote of No Confidence withdrawn.
Friday.—Sage of Queen Anne's Gate came out from his cave to-
night and delivered instructive homily. Has come to conclusion
that the Lords must go. Told House this in speech full of audacious
humour, and plain practical common sense. Sage has a certain
innocent air, childlike in its blandness, when he is saying the most
extraordinary things. This adds much to effect. Peers gaily crowd
to hear themselves described as "sitting in their own House like
sheep."
"And how do sheep sit?" asked Randolph, who is never above
obtaining information.
Cooke, of Newington, delivered interesting metaphysical lecture,
founded on Darwin and Galton. Objeot was to prove heredity of
genius, and of high intellectual qualities. Lord Denman and Lord
Stratheden-and-Campbell, in the Gallery, nodded assent. Earl
Cairns and Lord St. Leonards unfortunately not present. On
division in crowded House, Lords saved to us by 36 votes.
"My gracious!" said Stratheden-and-Campbell,. drawing a
long breath. "I thought we were gone."
Well, I hope it will prove a lesson to them," said Lord Denmait.
"If in future they listen to you and me, they won't get in scrapes of
this kind."
Business done.—House of Lords temporarily saved by 202 votes
against 166.
"MAD, MY MASTERS, MAD!"
The following additions will no doubt be made to the proposed
Lunacy Law Amendment Act on its passage through Parliament:—
1. No new Licensed House shall be opened, and all existing ones
shall be closed within two months of the passing of this Act, as it is
the intention of the Legislature to get rid of the possibly entire
support of the fatherless and the widow at the smallest oontrivable
cost to the Public
2. The Commissioners in Lunacy shall be abolished, and their
places supplied by the Receivers in the Bankruptcy Court, the duty
of District Visitors being undertaken (as already proposed) by
County Court Judges.
3. Dukes shall be admitted to Pauper Asylums at double the ordi-
nary rate. All other members of the aristocracy being received at a
considerable reduction.
4. In future no " single patient" shall be received into the private
charge of a Doctor, it being considered better for his health to allow
him to become one of the hundreds of inmates of a public Asylum.
5. All Asylums shall be opened from ten to four to the Public, who
shall, however, be requested, by freely displayed placards, "not to
touch the patients."
6. Every homicidal Lunatic shall be examined by a board, con-
sisting of the Lord Chancellor, the President of the Probate, Divorce,
and Admiralty Division, the Treasurers of the Four Inns of Court,
and the Lord Mator, once a fortnight, to discover whether it appears
to them advisable to send him home at once to the family circle.
7. No person shall be considered a homicidal lunatic until after
conviction at the Central Criminal Court.
8. Before a person can be found lunatic, he shall be examined by
the full Councils of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons,
the Lords Justices of Appeal, and a Jury chosen from the inmates of
cither Han well or Colncy Hatch.
9. and lastly. Alter passing all the stages but one, this Bill, con-
sequent upon some newer excitement engaging the attention of the
Public, shall be thrown out, and shelved indefinitely.
Time is Money.—Is it? Then, so much of it as there is that
honourable Members of Parliament can afford to spend in debate
between afternoon and dawn, what an exceedingly well-oif assembly
must be the House of Commons!

TRICKS ON TRAVELLERS.
I see constantly advertised that, between Calais and Nice, to carry
the voyageurs by the 10"35 train from Victoria, L. C. & D. (such a
convenient hour! No getting
up very early), there will be
provided "A luxurious Bogie
carriage." I don't believe in
ghosts, but I'm hanged if I
should like to travel in a car-
riage with a luxurious Bogie,
or in a luxurious carriage with
a Bogie, or in fact any sort of
carriage reserved for Bogies.
If this meets the eye of Mr.
J. Staat Forbes, Chairman, I
hope he '11 make arrangements
with the French Authorities to
have these Bogies regularly ex-
orcised—mind, exorcised, not
exercised—every morning.
Yours tremblingly,

MR. PUNCH'S METROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENTS.
(Projected with a special view to the Comfort and Recreation of Pedestriani,
Equestrians, and Her Majesty's Peaceable and Loyal Londonert.)
The Parks.—That the sunk fenoe between Hyde Park and Ken-
sington Gardens be filled up, and a clear ride be made right up to
the old Kensington Palace.
That two rides be cut intersecting the above-projected ride in a
North-Westerly and a North-Easterly direction, and leading from
Hyde Park Gate to Bayswater.
That two or three lesser rides be made through Hyde Park, and in
Kensington Gardens, similar to the sentiersya. the Bois de Boulogne.
That in Regent's Park rides be made in all directions; that at
least two new gates be made on the North side.
That tan be laid down at the side of the ordinary roads in Regent's
Park inner and outer circle for the convenience of equestrians. And
this also in Hyde Park, right round, as it is in summer.
That the Police at the N. W. passage of Oxford Street, between the
Marble Arch and Cumberland Gate be strictly charged to be as muoh
on the alert to stop busses and carts, and so to keep a way clear for
equestrians, as are the Polioe at the S.W. passage between Albert
Gate and Lowndes Square.
A scheme, involving compensation for disturbance, should be set on
foot—though this, evidently, does not directly concern equestrians,—
for doing away with all private residences within Regent's Park
itself, and constructing a Public Summer and Winter Garden on a
French and German model, with Restaurations open for luncheons,
dinners, and suppers, a theatre, a circus, lawn tennis grounds,
tennis court, boating by day, and by night fireworks on the orna-
mental water. Such an establishment is a real want, and Regent's
Park, being at once well within reach, and yet so far removed as to
offer no obstruction to traffic, is the very place for the purpose.
Parks and Streets.—All Processions, not oeing-State Pageants, should
be prohibited. All bodies of persons marching about with and playing,
or attempting to play, musical instruments, should be prohibited. Fine
and imprisonment should be the punishment for breaking these laws.
Quiet Street*.—All organ-grinders and so-called street-musicians
should not be permitted to come within a radius of ten miles of
Charing Cross on pain of imprisonment, fine, and, for a third offence,
penal servitude for not less than seven years.
Meetings.—Public spaces, at least four miles out of London, to be
set apart for open-air meetings, if required, and thatonly such spaces
shall be used for such purposes.
Parks.—The London Parks shall be only used by the Public for the
purposes of recreation and enjoyment, and not for political meetings,
haranguing, preachings, and suchlike nuisances, which render Sun-
day a day of turbulence and unrest, and prevent quiet, peaceable
"e, who are at work all the week, from enjoying the fresh air on
only holiday. {By Order)
Crowned with a Filet-be-Bcetjt. — The Reverend Freeman
Wills, Vicar of St. Agatha, Shoreditch, having already a cure of
soles, has turned butcher and meat-salesman, and so his time must
be pretty well occupied. His is the laudable object—(what would
Archbishop Laud have thought of it?)—of selling the best meat,
foreign and English, at the lowest possible prices. His success so far
seems considerable, as he has been able to pay a five per cent, dividend
to friends who have advanced him the working capital. Let him
become a greengrocer as well, set up a shop in Smithfield, and hang
out the sign of u The Steak and Two Martyrs."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
We own to being among those unfortunate people who are blind to
the merits of a great deal that De Quincet wrote, specially the Confes-
sions of an Opium Eater. It has been republished in that most
useful series, If or ley's Universal Library, and is bound up with an
Essay on Shaxspeare and one on Goethe, by the same author.
In murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts, the Mail Coach,
Secret Societies, and some half-dozen others, ana also in his Recol-
lections of the Lakes, he is at his beBt. He was a scholarly and a
polished essayist, but, if we are not mistaken, his works are caviare
to the general; and to the majority he is little more than a name.
Our old friend Mrs. Ram had heard of him, but thought that his
name was De Qutnsey, and that he was a throat-dootor. The
present republication will enable those who have not yet tasted this
opium dose to decide whether they think it a taste worth cultivating.
Of course, it can be taken in very small quantities the last thing at
night, when it will probably induce sleep.
In a Silver Sea, a romance in three volumes, by Mr. B. L. Farjeon
—published by Ward and Downey—and a very downy pair to give
such a book to the public It will bother and perplex readers, Dut
those who commence it will become more and more interested, be
unable to put it down until they've finished the third volume, and
then will breathe again, and be inclined to wonder how on earth
it was they have been so spell-bound. For it is a quaint, weird,
thrilling, mysterious, nightmarish work, like a screen of fantastic
scraps put together with some sort of mysterious purpose, riveting
attention, and exoiting curiosity. _ Occasionally the jerky dialogue
recalls Victor Hugo's style, specially in L'Homme qui Bit. In a
Silver Sea may be classed with Treasure Island, In a Glass Darkly,
Uncle Silas, King Solomon'B Mines, and books of that sort, which 1
am inolined to call "The Fat Boy Series"; for they all have one
object in common with that of the Fat Boy when he told Mrs. War die
that he wanted " to make her flesh creep." The oreeperest creepers
have been Mr. Le Fanu's. But Mr. Farjeon has run him very
near, and thrown in a touoh of Hugoesque dialogue into the bargain.
WELL WORTH NOTING.
Read the article in the Westminster Review, on "Grattan and
the Irish Parliament," and do not skip the footnote to the paragraph
relating to the foundation of Orangeism in 1795. But there is one
pleasant incident which may, perhaps, be recommended as a precedent
to the future Irish Legislators, which is that Grattan received from
the Parliament, in recognition of his splendid services, a grant of
£50/000. Of course he deserved it, so may Mr. Parnell, and we
wish he may get it. Another article we recommend is to be found
in the number of the Spectator for February 27. It is a review of
the Life of Father Burke, O.P. Though a thorough-going Nation-
alist, there was nothing Dantonesque about him; no "sombre
acquiescence" in murders and outrages: he, at least, was no party
to any " conspiracy of silence." Father Tom Burke was not to be
burked nor even gagged, even when he himself received a threatening
letter. He seems to have a worthy successor in Rev. J. O'Leart,
P.P. of Bally macelligott (what a name!), County Kerry, who, as
reported in the Daily News of Thursday last, gave it hot to the
"misguided wretches" who "had not their country's welfare at
heart, but went about collecting money for arms. Why do not the
Irish Ecclesiastics, as a body, speak out in this tone? Such remarks
as those recently made in the Times by the "Knight of Glih"
would then be impossible.
The School for Speech-making.—As an assembly in which new-
comers very shortly find their level, the House of Commons has been
happily likened to "a great publio sohool." Yes. Especially a school
which still upholds the system of fagging. The Fags, distinctly so
denominated, may be considered to tie formed of the honourable
Gentlemen appointed to serve on Committees. The Rod—Black Rod
—is in pickle in another place. Attention to work among the
"Commoners," however, is enforced by Whips.
The New Chief Police Commissioner.—As he distinguished him-
self in South Africa, it might be naturally supposed that Warren
would know more about blacking than the blues. No doubt Sir
Charles will deal summarily with black mail.
It isn't the Kiss of Peace they give at these Schools of Kisstian
Kissenters, but a kiss a-piece all round. Kismet! but it does sound
rather Harem-scarum.

THE WRATH OF ACHILLES THE LITTLE.
{Homeric Fragment lately Discovered at Athens.)

"Out on the Powers and their despotic sway!"
Little Achilles cried, " / shan't obey.
To keep the peace is all their present care,
With us 'tis aifferent: all we want is war.
Because they talk and threat, are we to shun
The fight, and leave our glorious task un-
done? I
Rise every Greek and see my spear confound
Our foemon's ranks, and deal destruction
round.
With emulation my bold deeds survey,
And learn fromme the business of the day."
He said, and tugged at his tremendous
blade.
When lo! two godlike shapes his efforts
stay""
Athene grave, Apollo bright, allied
'Gainst nim for onoe, and taking the
same side.
"Hillo!" the hero cried. "What,
both f By Jove,
Minerva, this is hard upon a cove.
I didn't think that you would bar the way
Of your pet warrior. What will Thetis
say ? 'r
"0 First of Greeks (Athene thus reioin'd)
The best and bravest of the warrior Kind;
'Tis not the season to kick up a shine.
Trust old experience and calm friendship—
mine.
Obey my counsel and to reason yield.
Put back that ready sword and quit the
field.
Though with red heaps you strew'd the battle
You ve everything to lose and nought to gain;
That is, just now. Another day, of course,
You '11 try if there is remedy in force.
Not now, we both advise; the Powers com-
mand it:
In fact, my little friend, they will not stand
it."
Swelled high the hero's heart, stuck fast his
blade.
And thus he murmured to his blue-eyed maid:
"Is then Achilles now no more thy care,
And dost thou then desert the great in wax f
And thou, Apollo P Must I keep my tent
For ever, whilst my foemen circumvent,
My rivals bag the booty? Why, oh why
Hinder me thus? Do let me have a shy!"
"Forbear!" (the Sun-god solemnly replies.)
To calm thy fury we forsake the skies.

THE SERVANTS."
The Marquis (engaging a Valet). "Haw—I HorE you like tour Ciqars full-flavoured ; for my last Man, who was good
ENOUGH TO ADMIT I SUITED HIM, I BELIEVE, SAID MINE WERE BEASTLY, AND MADE HIM SICK—AND SO TOOK HIMSELF OFF!"
Let great Achilles, to the gods resigned,
To reason yield the empire o'er his mind.
The force of what we 're saying thou must
feel.
So sheathe, obedient, thy revenging steel.
For I pronounce (and trust a heavenly pow'r)
Thy injured honour hath its fated hour.
Then let revenge no longer bear the sway,
Turn up thy tantrums, and the gods obey."
To him Pelides: ""With regardful ear
I list, of course, but oh, it's hard, it's queer.
Hard as it is, my vengeance I suppress.
Those who revere the gods, the gods should
bless."
He said, observant of the blue-eyed maid,
Then in the sheath returned the half-stuck
blade.
The gods then swift to high Olympus fly,
And join the sacred senate of tne sky.
THE SELDOM-AT-HOME SECRETARY
AND THE LICENSING CHAOS.
The deputation of Theatrical and Music
Hall Managers who assembled in Downing
Street, on Ash Wednesday, to check the en-
croachments of the Metropolitan Board of
"Works, were received with that affable igno-
rance which distinguishes what we may call
our Protean Government. When an esti-
mable gentleman like Mr. Childers appears
one minute as a Lord of the Admiralty, then
dips under a table and comes up as a Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer, then dips again and
comes up as a Home Secretary, he cannot be
expected to have that knowledge of the ques-
tions and people who come before him, that a
permanent official would have who had passed
all his life in one department, with the same
wig and spectacles. The mixed lot of gentle-
men who appeared before him represented
about as many systems of licensing as there
are castes in a Hindoo household. They not
only represented 600 London places of amuse-
ment, with a capital of four millions sterling,
and employing one hundred and fifty thousand
persons, more or less, but they represented
every corner of the chaotic licensing system.
Some gentlemen present were licensed by
the Middlesex Magistrates (a body of gentle-
men many hundreds in number and repre-
senting many sectarian prejudices), some
were licensed by the Surrey Magistrates (a
body of gentlemen"of more liberal tendencies),
some were licensed by the Divisional Magis-
trates, some by the Kent Magistrates, and
some by the corporation of the City of London;
some were licensed by the Crown in the shape
of a Royal Charter; and one gentleman held
a direct licence or patent from his late
lamented Majesty, Chables the Second.
One or two gentlemen, probably, were not
licensed at all, and many of those present
were licensed by a Court Official, known as
the Loed Chamberlain. The refreshment
powers of these gentlemen, in some cases,
were obtained from certain Magistrates, at
what are called Brewster Sessions; others
obtained the same powers direct from the
Excise, under an Act of William the Fourth;
some were looked after as to morality by a
Crown Officer, known as the Licenser of
Plays; others were looked after in a similar
way by the Police under a variety of Acts,
too numerous to mention; and above and
beyond all, exercising absolute authority over
all these gentlemen as regards the construc-
tion and alteration of Theatres and places of
public entertainment, stands the Metropolitan
Board of Works—the Parochial Parliament,
sixty strong, against whom these gentlemen
assembled to make a vigorous protest.
After seven years' experience of the action
of this glorified vestry, whom they had found
to be ignorant, obstinate, wasteful, and arbi-
trary, the Managers of our Public Amusements
in London waited upon the Minister to ask him
not only not to favour a Bill applyingfor ex-
tended powers by the Metropolitan Board of
Works, out to create a new department of the
Home Office charged with the inspection of
theatres, music-halls, and other places of a like
kind. If the Minister had had more than the
conventional ten minutes to spare, a case might,
and would have been, put before him that
would have suggested a reform and simplifi-
cation of the whole licensing system; that would
have drawn his attention to tne fact that many
publio buildings besides theatres and music-
halls require careful and rigid inspection in
London; and would probably have convinced
him that a hole-and-corner parochial Bill
which deals only with the Metropolis, and
ignores the rest of the Empire, is not a Bill to
be supported, even by a hurried and new-born
Home Secretary.
A Riddle foe all Companies.— 'Why,
asked Spines, suddenly, "is every man from
here a wilful suicide?"—"Because he is a
fellow d'ici."

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED PROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, March 8.—Something almost
pastoral in the peace in which the Irish Members live just now
with all mankind, especially the Chief Secretary. True, they
sometimes gird at Orangemen opposite, asking questions designed to
bring them into contempt. But the questions so mildly put, the
aspect of questioner so gentle, almost angelic, that when Major
Sanderson has jumped up once or twice in endeavour to answer
question himself, and when Johnston has shaken out the pennon of
his red beard preparatory to leading the fray, the incident closes
without a bone being broken.
Jqhn Mobley doing excellently at question time. Never tries to
be funny, but frequently draws a laugh. Never smart, never lectures
questioner, evidently gives all information he possesses, and fully
admits right of Private Member to question Public Minister. All
this tends to peace and the despatch of business. Tim Healt quite
an altered man. Confessed this evening that he'd been troubled for
some time with reflection on inconvenience Lord Lieutenant subjected
to, owingto the lack of Church accommodation provided for him in
Dublin. This is entirely Episcopalian, whereas Lord Aberdeen is a
Presbyterian. "Could, nothing be done?" Tim asks, with tender
intonation. Would it not be possible to place on the Estimates a sum
of money to build and endow a kirk for the use of Lord Aberdeen
during the term of his Viceroyalty? Looking further afield, and
having regard to the religious views of succeeding Viceroys, asked
wouldn't it be possible to appoint a Dean of the Chapel Royal so
highly gifted that he would be able to minister in whatever varied
ways to the spiritual wants of the Viceroy of the day? Money no
object to Tim. Only desire to make Viceroy comfortable on Sundays.
John Moblet met the question in the spirit in which it was put.
Scarcely a dry eye in the assembly.
After this, discussion on Crofters Bill seemed harsh and material,
broken by the one flight of fancy from the poetic mind of Ramsay,
who, in a sentence pictured the awful barrenness of the Isle of Lewis,
where '' thirty acres would not graze one snipe." Always recognised
in Ramsay man of imagination.
Business done.—Crofters Bill read Second Time.

"Wednesday. Usual proposal that
House, instead of meeting at
noon, shall foregather at Two,
the object being to allow Mem-
bers to go to church. Pease

beelain talking together in

Nooks and Corners of the House.
"Chamberlain Bros."
Long debate on Manchester Ship Canal Bill. Sexton had provided
himself with list of Members interested in Railways, and therefore,
he argued, not qualified to vote. Irish Member put on to watch
every Railway Director present. Two—Plunket and Tipping—
caught voting. Sexton moved Votes be disallowed. Plunket pro-
perly submissive. The Member for Stockport, Tipping a wink at
Speaker, said he 'd do it again, if they didn't mind. Division taken,
and Votes allowed.
In fact, a good deal of voting throughout sitting. On "Welsh
Disestablishment Question three Divisions taken before question
decided. First Vote on Dillwyn's Motion, next that Gbey's
Amendment be substituted. This carried by large majority, and
there New Members thought matter ended. Great triumph for
Member for Northumberland. Evidently the Grey mare the better
horse. But having agreed that Grey's Amendment should become
substantive Motion, the Motion, when put, was rejected by biggest
majority of the night. > "Don't quite know what I've done,'; said
New Member, with anxious face. "But I voted in every Division,
first "on one side, then on the other. Consequence is, we've voted the
whole business clean out of the House, leaving neither original
Motion, Amendment, nor amended Resolution. Don't know how it
was done, but there it is. Suppose it's all right."
Business done.—Motion for Disestablishment Church in "Wales
rejected.
Ash Wednesday.—House didn't meet till Two o'clock, so that
Members might go to church. This thoughtful provision largely
taken advantage of. A little after Two Members began to drop in
on their way from church. But, for the most part, they seemed to
have decided also to attend the afternoon services. Consequence
was, quorum with difficulty formed, and House nearly empty
throughout sitting. Amongst others who came in, Prayer Book in
hand, was Muntz. Member for Tarn worth. Muntz, as he presently
told House, "yielded to no man in the cause of Temperance.
Pease's Sunday Closing Bill on, and Muntz burned with desire to
say few words in support of Temperance principles. Only Four
o'clock, and plenty of time to say what was necessary on well-worn
topic. Muntz tucked Prayer Book under his arm, and sat down.
Frequent opportunity to interpose, but too polite to thrust himself
forward. Time and opportunity slipped by, but still he sat silent.
Twenty-five minutes past Five. Lloyd on Ms legs, speaking amid
cries of "Divide!" Shouted down 'at twenty-five minutes to Six.
In ten minutes debate must close. Now or never. "Now!" said
Muntz, rising, and facing crowd of angry Teetotallers, who howled
at him as if they had caught him breaking the pledge. He shook
his Prayer Book in their faoes. They bellowed Dack, "Divide!"
Watching his opportunity, he was able to interject amid the uproar
his confession of faith.
"I yield to no man," he cried, "in the desire to promote the cause
of Temperance."
After this the hubbub grew apace, till the hands |of the clock
pointed to a quarter to Six, when the Speaker rose, a great silence
fell on the House, and Members bustled out. The ardour of Muntz's
affection for Temperance had smothered the Bill designed to pro-
mote it.
Business done.—Sunday Closing Bill talked out by Mr. Muntz.
Thursday.—" "What becomes of the foals?" Question put by the
Sage of Queen Anne's Gate, with every appearance of the tenderest
personal interest. It arises in Committee of Supply on Civil Service
Estimates. Vote for Royal Palaces, including stud-house, at Hamp-
ton Court. The Sage, with all deference to the Chairman, surmises
that where there is a stud there must be foals. Hampton Court
Palace account shows no record of what becomes of the foals. Are
they spirited away? Are they sold in their tender years for butcher's
meat'( Or are they regarded as perquisites of the 230 persons who
look after the hundred norses, which there is no one to ride out of the
Royal Mews of Pimlico? No one could tell. Mr. Leveson-Goweb
didn't know. Even Mr. Ei lands was at fault. Question echoed
eerily through the Chamber, and there was none to answer it,
"Where are the foals?" .
Much conversation on the accommodation of the House. T. P.
O'Connor led off with complaint of general lack of convenience,
which lifelong usage had made essential. There was a decided in-
sufficiency of powdered footmen. The horses in the Royal Mews had
a proportionate attendance I of two grooms and a third for each,
whereas Hon. Members could not reckon upon the personal attend-
ance of more than one minion for every three. Besides, the atmosphere
was bad. being entirely free from the homely smell of peat, and the
smoke all going out up the chimneys. Lastly, there were no type-
writing machines for the use of " Plutarchs at ten guineas a week,"
as Sir Pat O'Brien once called Members of the House understood
to'vary their attendance upon national interests by writing "London
Letters" to provincial newspapers.
"Ah. there's no keeping pace with T. P.!" said Mr. Gilhooly,
M.P. He's always thinking of the paternal palace where the
descendant of one of the early kings used to eat his taties off a gould
plate, and sup his whiskey out of a silver flaygon."
Other Members seemed tolerably well satisfied with things, and
the Vote for Houses of Parliament agreed to.
Business done.—Civil Service Estimates. Railway and Canal
Traffic Bill introduced.
Friday.—Bbodrick had his little joke to-night, which should
become historic. It's the last of the kind possible. Gave notice that
on Monday will ask whether arrangements could be made for attend-
ance of a Minister,—" Not for the purpose of attacking, but of
defending the Estimates." This, of course, a little hit at Henry
Fowleb, who yesterday declined, being above the Gangway, to go
contrary to views on Public Parks expressed below Gangway.
Familiar practice this, to make up elaborate little attack on some
one, throw it into form of question, and give public notice. Needn't

necessarily do any more. Had your fling at the enemy. Let the
mud stick. Irish Members adepts in this art. But never no more!
Selwyn Ibbetson, few hours after Brobrick had spoken, carried
Resolution prohibiting the giving of notices of a question vtvS voce.
After protest by Irish Members, House, to its surprise, found the
whole thing settled. Marvel is nuisance has existed so long.
"Now the House finds it so surprisingly easy to deal with vanity,
and personal or party spite," said Hartington, "perhaps it will go
a step further. Why should Notices of Motion be read aloud to
indifferent House by the pleased author?"
Business done.—Best of the week. The reading aloud of choice
literary compositions stopped.
SHAKSPEARE EN SUITE.
Sir,—I am not surprised that my version of Hamlet has met with
what the French call "un chaud accueil," and the result has inspired
me at once to settle down with my Ollendorff and dictionary, and
tackle another play. This time I have gone at Macbeth, and with
what success you will be able to judge from the following few
random extracts that I just throw in as a specimen of what I have
been doing with it. Take the very first line, for instance:—
When shall we three meet again? &c, &c.
This becomes—
Quand serons nous trois encore reunies?
Sans le tonnerre, l'eclair, ou sans parapluie?
Then again, a little further on, when Banquo and Macbeth first
come across the Witches, and Banquo asks—
What are these—
So withered and so wild in their attire? &c., &o.
This, with a little freedom to get in the rhyme, runs—
Mon dieu, mais qu'est-ce qu'ils sont que celles-la,
Qui bien habillees vraiment ne sont r~
Qui quoi qu'ils existent apparamment sur la terre,
D'&trc les vrais habitants n'en ont pas Pair.
Then Macbeth addresses them—
Speak, if you can: What arc you?
To which the First Witch makes answer1—
All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of G lam is!
This is expressively rendered thus—
Macbet. Parlez, si vous pourez, qu'est-ce que voua etes?
De nc pas savoir peut-etre nous sommes b£tes.
Ire Sorcicre. Biere a tous, et remarquez que je dis bis.
BiiSrc a vous, Monsieur Macbet, due de Glamis!
The famous speech—
Is this a dagger that I see before me,
The handle towards my hand? Come, let me clutch thee; &c, &c,
runs quite glibly, thus—
Est-ce que ccci est un poignard qu'a
Je vois devant moi tout-a-fait—ca vi
avec mes yeux
va mieux—
La poignee vers ma main? Tenez, permettez
Que je rous saisisse avec un air gai.
Je ne vous ai pas, mais vraiment, sur ma foi,
C'e*t bien sur au meme temps que je vous vois.
But perhaps the happiest passage is the following, where Macbeth,
at the banquet, is disturbed Dy the apparition of Banquo. It runs—
Macbeth. Avaunt! and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee!
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold:
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes.
This I have turned very neatly as follows, and have, I think,
given the idea of the speculation very happily:—
Macbet. Arriere! quittez ma vue! Soyez cache dans la terre!
Tes os sont sans moelle!
Spectre de M. Banquo. Oui! une triste affaire.
Macbet. Ton sang est froid; et inspirees de la meme source,
Tes yeux n'ont pas l'air de sc m£ler dans la Bourse!
One more quotation, and I am done:—
Lay on, Macdufp,
And damned be him that first cries, Hold, enough!
redblves itself, as you can see, most naturally into—
Appliquez-vous bien, Macduff, et sera-t-il sacre
Qui le premier dira, "Tenez, j'en ai eu assez!"
There—but I needn't add more. You will see from the above of
what the Divine Williams is capable in a f oreign tongue if he only
falls into the right hands. To make it acceptable to Sarah, I shall
probably roll up the Three Witches into Lady Macbeth, and so
strengthen up the part a bit. Meantime I am happy to be,
Yours literally, Longly R. Parry,
Real Aim of Sir Joseph's Sunday Closing Bill.—" To make a
solitude, and call it—Pease."

ROBERT ON KISSING GAMES."
Wot a wurld we lives in without knowing it! and how ewerythink
seams to be a being turned topsum turvem as theLoryers says! Fust
we has in the werry
House of Communes
itself, gennelmen com-
paring most respee-
tabel people as wants
to be Barrowncts, to
hungry donkeys as
wants thistles, and is
the awdacious member
at once suspended?
no, but everybody
larfs at the crewel
Jester. That seems
pretty well to begin
with, but wot's that
compared to wot toi-
lers. Suppose as I had
been arsked last week
by the Prime Minister,
let us say, or by the
werry Arch Bishop of
Canterbury hisself,
sum sitch question as
this—
"Please, Mr. Ro-
bert, were is the most
Scene at Hip. "hinneroentest and
r most kerrectest place
in all the hole of hinnercent and kerrect Lundon P"
"Please your grace's honner," I shood have replied, "in a Sunday
SkooL"
And now what do I read? Why sitch a seen of low wulger de-
borchery as makes my pen blush as I rites of it. Wot's called
"kissing games," kept up from 6 in the evenin till midnite! Going
through what they calls their drill in pares of differing sexes, when
"present arms" meant embracing, and "fire a wolley" ment
kissing! I don't dare discribe it all. Mr. Punch's wollums is
meant for the pure and the hinnercent. Plenty of fun but no tilth..
But wot most estonishes me is to wunder how any growed-up parson
or minister can not only allow all this to go on hunder his werry nose
but acshally to jine in it. Don't let me brag too mutch of my hone
wirtue, speshally arter last week's rewerlashun, but, dear me! ony
to fansy a rewerent Gent of mature hage kissing no less than 60
damsells, and all on 'em young! and this partickerlerly afecshunate
Gent is we are told a leader of a Temprance Satiety!
In another game these pretty, full-grown hinnercents plays, all
the gentlemen, as they calls theirselves, kisses all the ladies, as they
calls theirselves, in sucksession! I wunders wot Mrs. Robert wood
say if I was to harsk to be aloud to be a Teecher in that not werry
partickler Sunday Skool! I werry much fears as my motives might
posserbly be misconstructed. It has jest struck me werry foroeably
that my Son William has lately bin giving up a lot of his lezzur
time to Sunday Skool teaching. I wunder if they has any of wot a
Mr. A. C. B. calls "these innocent recreations and amusements," at
his heddicational establishment. I think as I must get his other
parient to make a few gentle inquirys upon this werry delicate
subject.
Sum peeple seems to fancy as all these horful rewelashuns will
freatly reduse the number of Sunday Skool pupils and Teechers,
ut Brown, who's about as good a judge of the bad side of pore
human natur as most Waiters, says oh no, o contrari, as the ger-
mans says,—which means in plane English, quite another pare of
shoes,—for the skrumpshus acounts as has been published in the
Cristien Million—there's a circulashun for you, Mr. Tellygraph—
will fill 'em all full to the bung, as the Brewers says, and the
"Games" will go on more merryer than ever. That's Brown's
opinion, but Brown isn't everybody, not by a long: ways, and my
opinion is, as knowing more of the good side of things than of the
bad, thanks to my shuperior position, that there's nothing rong as
can stand long against publick opinion, and publiek opinion says
with a woice of thunderjwhatever else may appen in this pore world
of ours, where we all. Waiters and all, has to work so ard and so
reglar to resist temtashun, speshally a sertain temtashun as shall be
nameless, our skool children, speshally our Sunday Skool children,
shall be kep pure and hinnercent, and not subjected to these
"kissing games," as is a disgrace to all conserned, but most of all to
the grown-up canting Mawworms as stands by and looks on and
sumtimes ewen jines in 'em, to the disgust of all true men and the
oontemp of all true Waiters. Robert.

"One of the Friendlies" loquitur:—
Are you wishing for snug berths and liberal

Are you game for whopping screws and little
work?
Do you like accounts, with none to check their
pages?
Are you fond of liberal dealings as to
"Wk " t
Then do nottread the common paths of trading,
Oh, no! there is a preferable plan! <
Go in for something Friendly, whose per-
vading
Single purpose is to help the Working Man!
That's the lay, my little dears, above all
others.
To encourage in the ways of careful thrift
Our beloved labouring fellowmenand brothers,
Is to give our joint humanity a lift.
The poor—and tnere are always such a lot of
them—
As pasture for per-centages are prime:
A little business skill may make a pot of them,
And do the philanthropic all the time.
The Poor Man's Friend! What exquisite
propriety
In giving that most honourable name
To the founder of a Benefit Society!
Besides, it's such a pleasant, paying game.
Then Provident Insurance is another fine
In which a deal of good may be achieved.
In fact, what one may call the "friend and
brother" line
Brings profit that would hardly be believed.
You get a batch of parties influential,
And let them start a scheme, no matter what ,
So it's provident, or friendly, or prudential,
And the thrifty poor are at it like a shot.
You hook them, like the mackerel, by millions,
And every one you hook means pickings
fine—
You build premises like palaces or pavilions,
And oh, now you may live, and dress, and
dine!
You may salary your servants very lavishly,
For that, you see, will keep them in tne

A man will hardly round upon you knavishly
Whilst you can make it snug and warm
for him.
With good pay, sly perks, and prospect of a
pension,
Long holidays, and "leaves" without

A chap must be a bilious fool to mention—
Any little.thing that you may wishkeptdark.
The poor are very many, sometimes thrifty,
But seldom 'cute, and often out of work;
So per-centages may run as high as fifty,
And there are no known limits to the" perk."
There's such a liberal margin, so much latitude
In forfeits and in fines and other fakes.
You're prosperous, and the poor are full of
gratitude,—
Unless, by some rare chance, suspicion
wakes.
An Expensive History.—Brycev. Rusden.
How Mr. Rusden must have cursed the
moment when the unhappy thought occurred
tohim, "I will write a history of NewZealand."
The moral is, don't write a history before the
history is ready to be written; that is, before
the chief actors in it have qualified for immor-
tality in the historian's pages. • Be sure that
they are as dead as Queen Anne, than whom
no one is popularly supposed to be deader, and
then out with paper and ink, and say what
you like. Heavens! if "the mighty dead"
nad suddenly become the mighty Living,
what actions for libel there would nave been
against our greatest historians! Richard the
Third, Mary, Queen of Scots, Bluff King Hal,
Cromwell, James the Second, and the great
Duke of Marlborough could have ruined a
few of them. Why, Macaulay would have
been banished toNew Zealand, and Mr. Froude
would have been broken by damages. Let
Mr. Rusden take heart. The history of New
Zealand has yet to be written.
Printers' Devilries.—The Sussex Daily
News is a popular paper, which has lately
been delivered over to the mercies of a new
p. d. He had evidently been exorcised by the
recent riots, for, in an article on Mr. Mor-

as Mr. Morley suggests, we really pass
Niagara, all is loot." Loot, for lost, is good.
And in last Thursday's number, half mixing
him up with Lord Chan bourne, he makes
the excellent Colonial Secretary figure as
"Lord Cranbille." It sounds like a quite
delightful variety of the Colonial bird.

"Grr down, and hold up your hands!"
The three passengers by the Sierran stage-coach descended,
of them moved an eyelid in a weary, perfunctory way.
furious, alert but helpless, moved another eyelid.
"Drop that!" said a voice with an officious coolness; adding,
"There is a man here with a package of greenbacks. You will save
time and trouble if you '11 tote it out."
Then the three passengers, the stage-driver, and the express mes-
senger lay with their faces on the sweep of granite covered with
luxurious foliage, and concluded. "Good night!"
It was the signal that they were free. The greenbacks were
transferred, the three passengers resumed their places, the stage-
driver cracked his whip, and the horses sprang furiously forward.
"And there were only three men, and we were six! cried Hale,
passionately. The passenger who had given up the greenbacks
raised a wrinkle on his forehead.
"I reckon I am talking to Kernel Clutch," said the passenger
beside Hale, with sudden alacrity. "I'm Rawlins of Frisco."
The two men languidly grasped each other's hands, and talked
about the weather.
"But cannot we contrive, with average good fortune, so to sur-
round them that they must calculate to surrender at discretion?"
said Hale, with true Bostonian verbiage.
"Wal, we '11 try," said the Colonel. And, with a shout, the
passengers seized four horses a-piece, and rode with whirlwind inten-
sity into a forest.
conclude it's George Lee and Ned Falkneb," observed the
Colonel. "We shan't, however, get their track, as I calculate here's
a snowstorm."
The speaker was right. At that moment the whole face of the
country, with its wild beauty and granite ridges, and the rest of it
was swallowed up by seventeen hundred feet of snow.
"I fancy I shall not get to Eagle's Court to-night," observed
Hale. And, although a stranger in those parts, he was right.
Chapter II.—Boston Form.
. Kate and her sister, Mrs. Hale, and John's mother, Mrs. Scott,
lived in one of those highly peculiar places only to he found in
America. The bold, wild, rugged granite and the dark-green fir-
trees flourished in the customary luxuriance. Kate, although she
dressed in a sou'-wester, a pilot's jacket, and a moire antique skirt
by Worth, was yet perfectly and entirely refined. She was a true
Bostonian, and although living twenty-four thousand feet above the
level of the sea, in a grand rugged country full of the marvels of
nature, she yet never went abroad without white kid gloves up to
the elbows.
Two men suddenly appeared, drenched in blood. The youngest,
who could scarcely speak for laughing, went down on one knee,
and, kissing the hands of the ladies, explained, "Pardon me, fair
ones, but you will find we are not unentertaining, as we are well
red." The old lady screamed, and the younger ones blushed.
Mrs. Scott, however, asked them in to five o'clock tea, of which
they partook with a certain gaiety of spirit which pointed to some
old Huguenot ancestor of the long ago.
In the meanwhile, all the country for twenty thousand miles
round Eagle Court was embedded in a deep drift of snow.
The two friends retired, at length for the night. They exchanged
whispers,—
"George"—"Ned." "I say, dear boy, a murderer is entering
the window. Shall we show daylight through him?"
"It would be rare sport," answered the other. "We must not
fire, as we should alarm the ladies."
Then the companions (who had both a keener sense of fun) lashed
the would-be assassin to death.
Is there anything the matter?" asked good old Mrs. Scott,
tting out her head, which was now wearing a large-sized, roomy,
avUv-frilled night-cap. "I thought I heard something."
"We conclude there is nothing," said the gentlemen, falling on
tneir knees, and kissing the good dame's fingers.
"When it thaws—John will return!" murmured Mrs. Hale.
Chapter III.—Fooling Around.
A month had passed in the rugged bramble-covered cation of
Eagle's Court. The ladies and the gentlemen had paired off
together. Ned, with his sad eyes and long moustache, which was
as glossy and well fixed up as a lady's curl, seemed to take an
especial interest in Kate, while George paired off with Mrs. Hale.
John has no sympathy with highwaymen," said George to
Mrs. Hale with greater gravity than usual. And then he threw off
his cares, and standing on his head, asked her, " Why a duck put his
head under water?" and other conundrums equally amusing.
puti
hea'
"Can he have cut the throats of twenty-six Bank Managers, and
yet be so gay?" murmured Mrs. Hale.
"Certainly—why not? How are you to-morrow?" And the
light-heartett young gentleman danced about like a first-class clown
at a Friscan circus.
"I hope he has not gone too far," commented Kate, who now
changed her dress ten times a day. She came from Boston.
Chapter IV.—Fixings.
Kate and Mrs. Hale were in tears. They had heard all the
story of Ned and George's little murders, and now the two gentle-
men were gone. Yes, gone!
George returned. Mrs. Hale was as pale as a sheep. Then she
looked up at her husband.
"What do you think of George Lee?"
"The best and dearest fellow that ever lived," replied the owner
of Eagle's Court, enthusiastically, "and if he does murder people,
why the habit has been acquired under the influence of a number of
trivial circumstances entirely out of his control."
A year afterwards, Falkneb, now Vice-President of the United
Statesj was hugging Kate.
"His last words were," he murmured, "if I am not killed at the
head of the Bowie Knife Corps, I hope some day to stand beside Mrs.
Hale, her mother, with perhaps the body of her husband thrown in,
watching you two coming home."
"George would always have his joke," replied the fair girl, with
a half-suppressed peal of silvery laughter.
"If you have done kissing one another, and murdering the gar-
dener," cried good Mrs. Scott, in her bonnet de unit, " 'just conclude
it's time for five o'clock tea."
And the fair girl and the Vice-President dancing a light fandango
learned among the half-castes of the boundless prairie of the Snow-
bound Sierra, gaily entered the dwelling-house amidst peals of the
heartiest laughter. And Nature concluded to remain as she was—
forever!
A CHEAP WATER-SUPPLY.
What a gross libel it is upon the Directors of our Metropolitan
Water Companies to say that they are not liberal-minded gentle-
men to the very fullest extent. Listen, oh ye thirsty grumblers, to
the generous offer made by the Directors of one of the principal of
them, through their Chairman, to a dissatisfied Citizen of London,
who actually complained of having to pay the paltry sum of £25
per annum tor about forty pails-full of water a-day! What did the
Chairman say to this unreasonable man? He sympathised with him,
and made him the following generous offer. As he had calculated
that about forty pails-full of water would be quite sufficient for his
daily consumption at his house of business, the Company would
allow him to send his men daily to their reservoir, which was only
about three miles' distance, where they might fill their pails to the
very brim, and for which privilege the Company would make no
charge! Strange to say, the ungrateful Citizen, instead of expressing
his boundless gratitude for such unheard-of liberality, expressed the
very opposite feeling, in such painful language that he was ordered
to leave the Board-room!

We've read his Snotc-Bound, but we don't see the drift.

I do not know, except that they love advertisement, notoriety, fuss
and blowing of trumpets. It may be objected that " booking " would
I be rendered difficult under such circumstances, as, without previous
I warning on a particular night a Manager might remove from the
bills some _piece which a considerable number of the public had
booked their places to see. This is no difficulty if the Theatre
Francais plan of booking is adopted. There, if I remember rightly,
the booking is for a certain piece, not for a certain night. Your
seat is retained for you for whatever representation of the piece you
like to specify: say the second, third, fourth; what you will.
There is an old story of a young gentleman taking a ticket for the
second performance of somo piece at the Theatre Francais, but after
a first night's failure, or in consequence of the outbreak of a revolu-
tion next day, it was not played again for twenty-five years, when
the first person to present nis ticket at the door was a grey-haired
man of fifty, who, a quarter of a century before, had booked, for this
performance.
To these remarks I have been led by the first-night failure of Mr.
Bar's "Original Farce, in Three Acts," produced at the Vaudeville
last Thursday. I was not there, but requested a voung friend to
tell me what the piece was like on the first night. He simply wrote
across his bill, "Stupid," but scribbled against Mr. Thorne, "Very
good," and against the two young ladies, Misses Helen Forsyth
and Maud Millett, "Good." He added that it had been an
"original Faroe" by somebody else, in French, but was not an
"original Farce" by Mr. Rae, in English. That was hie opinion.
The next morning I looked to see what the Critios of the Daily
Telegraph, Standard, Daily News, and Times had to say about it.
- The Critic of the Daily Telearaph tried to make the weather
responsible for the temper of the audience, which was shown in
I "howls and execrations from the Pit, followed by contemptuous
sneers from the Stalls." What a reception for a Farce in Three
Acts!" But the comic scene of the last Act, laid in an English Res-
taurant, was too much for the most temperate audience." . . . "The
pent-up patience gave way, and it was a very difficult matter to
quell the last of the threatened storms." So it appears there was a
near approach to a regular riot over this original Three-Act Farce
by the gentleman whom the kindly disposed Telegraph Critic termed
"luckless Mr. Rae."
The Standard Critic spoke of it as a "faltering and not very
intelligible story," and he finished up with " On the whole the re-
ception of the piece was dubious; there was applause, but there
were symptoms of dissatisfaction,"—which seems a very mild version
of the previous Critic's description of " howls and execrations from
the Pit, followed by contemptuous sneers from the Stalls." The
Standard Critio is evidently of that happy philosophio temperament
which finds it so easy to bear the sufferings of others.
The Daily News Critio reported the reception of the farce with
"jeers and groans, against which the applause of more friendly
spectators contended with no little difficulty, and not always, it must
be confessed, with complete success."
The Times Critic summed, it up thus:—" The whole piece, plainly
speaking, is a farrago of nonsense, which seems to have been accepted
by the management, on the supposition of Mr. Rae's being the
'Author,' as he is styled in the playbill, instead of the 'adapter' of
The Man with Three Wives." He too tells of the unruly and dis-
orderly audience, and of the Author being called out and " greeted
with a volley of groans." As I have already said, I have not seen the
piece, but taking into account all the difficulties of a first night's
performance, is it likely that any piece, be it what it may, is on such
an occasion heard at its best, if it have a best?
When will the vulgar fashion of calling an Author before the
curtain be given up? An Author can't help himself, he is compelled
to respond, or his non-compliance is misinterpreted. Better the old
French way of keeping secret the name of the Author until the fate
of the piece is determined by the public, and then announcing it
from the stage. Who was injured Dy Mr. Wyndham's reticence as
to the adaptership of The Candidate f Who has adapted Denise for
the Haymarket? If it is a success, let the public know, but not till
then.l Nibbs, the Reformer.

QUO TENDIMUSP"
Being a Brief Academic Conversation held A. D. 1926.
"Still further changes are in process of being added to the long list of
those which recent years have effected in the course of education at Oxford
and Cambridge. At the latter University, which prides itself so much on
keeping abreast with all forms of modern progress, the proposal is to-day to
be made to establish an Engineering Tripos, as the fit complement of the
Engineering School directed by Professor Stuabt. At Oxford a yet more
startling change has been agreed upon. The examination known as 'Pass
Divinity' is about to be abolished."—Leading Article in the Timet.
The Strangers' Room at a London University Club. An Oxford
Don and a Cambridge Professor discovered entertaining their
Nephew, Eusebius, a prospective Undergraduate, at Luncheon.
Cambridge Professor [winding up an exhaustive Panegyric on
his own University). Well, my boy, all I can say to you is this: If
Sou wish to break away from the foolish and effete tradition that
olds that there is any learning worthy the name apart from techni-
cal instruction, you must set your face to Cambridge. Look at the
variety and choice she offers you. Would you be a Tailor, she gives
you a pass in Pattern-cutting; a Pastry-cook, there is the Pie-crust
Tripos open to you. Indeed, my boy, there is practically no limit to
the advantages now offered to the ambitious student. Look at my case.
How did I get my Glass-blowing Professorship except by taking up
the manufacture of soda-water bottles for my great go, and experi-
menting in the University furnaces ever since. Cambridge, believe
me, is the place for you.
Eusebius. It certainly looks like it. But is Oxford less liberal,—
less within touch of the times? What does Uncle Bogus say?
Oxford Don [with enthusiasm). Oxford less liberal, less within
touch of the times? My dear Eusebius, what can you be thinking
of? Why, she is, in all that concerns the highest cult, far in
advance of the Sister University. Look at her magnanimous atti-
tude in the matter of Theology. Buddha, Confucius, Zoroaster,
and the Fetish worship of the South Pacific, all have their Pro-
fessorial exponents; and Christianity—such is the genuine liberal-
ism of the age—is practically unknown. Why, I hold a living
myself; but do I know anything about the Scriptures or the Thirty-
Nine Articles? No, my dear boy, no—a thousand times no! I took
the Vedas up for my degree, and I have found them, spiritually,
amply sufficient ever since. You must come to Oxford.
Eusebius. The prospect is encouraging. The practical abandon-
ment of Christianity that you mention so aptly accentuates the feeling
of modern Society on the matter. But what of Cambridge?
Cambridge Professor. Not a whit behind in the intellectual march.
On the contrary, her Atheism is as robust as it is notorious. We
have learned to be practical at Cambridge. But come, brother,
confess it,—at Oxford you are still spiritual.
Oxford Don. No, I do not admit it. There you mistake. We
regard Spiritual Systems as merely the dried husks of fervid poetic
fanoy.
Cambridge Professor. But you wear the white tie of a parson!
You have taken Anglican orders?
Oxford Don. Yes, forty years ago. Times have changed Bince
then, and I have marched with them.
Cambridge Professor. But surely your attitude towards Chris-
tianity is one of sceptical benevolence r
Oxford Don. You might say, rather of critical antagonism, were
it not that its glaring puerilities placed it beyond the pale of philo-
sophic investigation. Come, come, Eusebius, I can see that the
thought of the free intellectual air of Oxford invigorates you. Let
me write to the Dean, and have your name down for Christohurch.
Cambridge Professor. No, no, my.boy. You come to Trinity.
Think of the practical advantages. Why, Nevil's Court is converted
into a huge Smithy. At Oxford they've only done away with Latin
and Greek. At Cambridge we have sent everything to the right-
about. Come, my boy, and go in for a technical degree. Take your
M.T. Finish up as a Master of Trade.
Oxford Don. Or better still, as the new D.D., or "Doctor of
Doubt." That, Eusebius, is a distinction worth earning, and the one
that our modern Oxford can, par excellence, confer upon you. My
boy, believe me, my dear old sceptical, free-thinking atheistical,
Alma Mater is the proper place for you.
Eusebius. Thank you, my dear Uncles, both of you for your excel-
lent counsel. The prospect in either direction is inviting, and quite
delightful. Fortunately, such empty futilities as Faith and
Morals" appear to disfigure neither programme, but as I am held in
natural hesitation between the unbounded attractiveness of both,
I will, with your kind permission, take a little time before I make
my final choice.
Cambridge Professor. Very well, my boy, take your timo by all
means; but think of your technical future.
Oxford Don. Certainly; and, before you decide, ask yourself, as
we asked ourselves forty years ago, " Quo tendimus f"

REGULATIONS FOR THE NEXT DRAWING-ROOM.
(Founded on Precedent.)
1. Carriages containing dicollette Dowagers and thinly-clad
Debutantes shall wait in the Mall or Grosvenor Place for three hours
in an easterly wind.
2. During the aforesaid "wait" the carriage-windows shall be
assailed by a large and Jeering mob of Cads and Snobs.
3. On reaching the Palace, the Ladies shall be shot out of their
carriages with a jerk, and hustled up a flight of steps.
4. On entering the hall, Ladies shall be hurried into an anteroom,
in which they shall leave their wraps, to be subsequently confused
with other similar habiliments.
5. In passing through the various apartments leading to the
Throne-Room, Ladies shall be either roasted near the fire or frozen
by the windows.
6. In passing from one room to the next. Ladies shall be forced to
push and fight like cheap-trippers outside the ticket-hole of an
excursion-train.
7. On appearing before Her Majesty or the Princess or the
Duchess, Ladies' trains will be flattened out, pushed on, and wound
up at the rate of ten a minute.
8. On leaving the Presence, the wrap-discovery difficulty shall
commence, and continue for forty minutes, more or less.
9. On finding their shawls Ladies shall have the privilege of
freezing in the Hall for an hour before their conveyances are found
and brought round.
10. The hustle into carriages on the departure shall equal the shoot
out of coaches on the arrival.
11. Notice is given that ladies who left home shortly after eleven
will not return until nearly five,
12 and Last. That after all the above fussing, expense and trouble
have been incurred for the sake of social distinction, it is not impos-
sible that some mistake may be made in the Lord Chamberlain's
Department in publishing the names of the ambitious victims.

THE SHOP HOUES REGULATION BILL.
Deab Mb. Punch,—Mr. Biggar once took exception to a certain Bill, on the
gound that it was " much too narrer in its scope," but the compass of the Shop
ours Regulation Bill will satisfy even his large ideas, for the sphere it embraces
would affect wholesale as well as retail establishments. As a member of a
large wholesale firm in the City, I venture to address you, with the hope of show-
ing that no legislation is required for regulating the hours of labour in sueh houses
as ours, and there are many similar ones in the Metropolis.
Our hours of business are regulated by the amount of daylight, speaking
generally, from 10 to 4 in the winter, and 9 to 6 in the summer, for we never
use gas in the shop, it is so expensive and dirty and spoils the goods, consequently
on foggy days our employes have nothing to do, and are at liberty to amuse them-
selves in any way they choose. In addition to these impromptu holidays, which,
owing to the exigences of our peculiar climate, are pretty frequent, they have all
the recognised Bank Holidays, Boat-Race Day, Harrow and Eton Cricket-match
Days, and Derby Day. This last holiday was an innovation introduced by the
present senior member of the firm, who once ran second in a race at Hampton,
with a horse called Brother to Beelzebub, which he acquired in part-payment
of a bad debt, and he has naturally taken a great interest in racing ever since.
No employi is required to attend on his birthday, or, if married, on his wedding
day, or the anniversary of Jumbo's death. I may mention, that we are in the
ivory trade, and this is a tribute of respect paid to the largest personal producer
of our goods known to modern times. The suggestion of thus Keeping the date
ever green in our recollections was made by the office-boy, a mere lad, but full
of fine feeling. I think, therefore, you will agree with me, Sir, that we are
not unnecessarily harsh in the matter of holidays.
A Club is established on our premises where the young men can dine either
a la carte or at aprix fixe. Mustard is supplied gratis. We lose by that. There
is a library well furnished with books (we are now adding Sir John Lubbock's
100. and have quite lately secured a copy of the editio princeps of Happy Thoughts
in fine condition), games of draughts, dominoes, spilikins, fox-and-goose, and a
German game called "Spielteufel," which no one has jet mastered, although
there is a code of rules in seventeen languages pasted inside the box. Our Corre-
spondence Clerk, who knows a little French, says he thinks it has something to do
with Bismarck and another man, whom he calls Reichstag.
In case of illness, the young men are at once transferred to the private hospital
attaohed to our place of business, and attended, at our
expense, by the firm's medical man, a young practitioner
who has completely emancipated himself from the pre-
judices of the old. school, and will treat the invalid
allopathically, antipathically, homoBopathically, hydro-
pathically or electropathically as he may prefer.
Every employi must wear goloshes in wet weather; the
infraction of this rule is attended with instant dismissal.
Not wishing to trespass any further on your valuable
space, I trust I have made it dear that if legislation is
desirable for regulating the hours of labour for faotory
hands and those employed in retail trades, it is entirely a
work of supererogation for establishments like that re-
presented by Yours truly, Benjamin Dent.
(Dent, Tusker 8r Dent, Long Acre.)
MUSICAL CRITICISM "AS SHE IS WROTE.'
Under the auspices of the London Harmonic Union
(of which His Serene Highness Prince Pumpernickel,
of Potstausend, is President) a very fine selection of
Music was performed last night at St. James's Hall
before an overflowing house. Long before the Conduotor,
Herr Abmeteufel, had taken his stand upon the
rostrum, every seat had been appropriated; and while
Amateurs naturally mustered in strong force, the profes-
sional element was very strongly represented m the audi-
torium, as well as upon the chairs which, to meet the
unprecedented demand, had been arranged behind the
orchestra. The Concert opened with Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony. This colossal work is doubtless the finest of
the master's earlier Symphonies—excepting, of course,
the tenth and eleventh—and is too well known to re-
quire any detailed analysis at the present day. Suffice
it to say that the splendid band worked to perfection in
the familiar strains under the rhythmical beat of Herr
Abmeteufel's baton.
Naturally the greatest interest centered round the pro-
duction of Mr. John Smith's new "Tone Poem,"
entitled The Maid of All Work. This, the only novelty
included in the scheme of this season's prospectus, was
bound to attract the cognoscenti, and indeed all those who
have the welfare of National music at heart. Mr.
Smith is stated to have derived his inspiration from an
inoident occurring in his own household. Be this as it
may, the subject is evidently of an intensely romantic
nature, and the Composer, in dealing with it, has had
the good sense to divide it into distinct movements, with
an appreciable break between each. The musicians are
thus enabled to snatch a few moments' breathing time
about every forty minutes—a notable improvement on
the old plan.
On a first hearing it is almost impossible, and it might
be also indiscreet, to attempt to enter into a minute
criticism of the Maid of All Work. It will be sufficient
to record the favourable impression produced by the
pizzicato of trombones in the adagio, combined with the
ingenious contrapuntal facility involved in the introduc-
tion of a syncopated figure in triple time upon muted
flutes and oboi. The rendering by the instrumentalists
was more than adequate; but of the work as a whole it
is undesirable to speak with authority until we have
been able to ascertain in which direction the consensus
of the Critics will go. In the meantime we shall suspend
our judgment.*
* We wanted an independent critioism, and we've got it.
Only if he suspend) his judgment again, we'll suspend him.

nceum indulges in a sensational Advertisement, but in the

Some wag once anticipated that the Universe would ultimately
become a branch of the British Post Office. Is British Trade to
become a branch (extra-official) of the Civil Service? The proposed
"Civil Service Bread Company" would seem to be a tentative step
in that direction. But before this sort of thins is carried any
further, the Public will have some awkward questions to ask of our
Ten-to-Four toffs. It is a wise thing—from the worldly-wise point
of view, at least—to let a sleeping (British) lion lie. Civil Service
Trading is not so entirely sound and satisfactory a thing as to be
able to provoke close inquiry with impunity. If our Civil Service,
well paid and well pensioned, has, in addition, the leisure to enter
into a favoured competition with struggling self-supported Trade,
there would seem, from the point of view of simple justice and
publio economy, to be something wrong somewhere. Where that
wrong is, inquiry, once started, would soon elioit—with results. For
the present it may suffice to suggest that John Bull is not very
anxious to have the interests of "the staff of life" too closely
identified with those of his Civil Service Staff. Verb. Sap.

"PETER BELL" IMPROVED.
Peter was tired of being dull,
"One of the plaguy flowers I *11 cull,"
Cried he, and see what can be in it,"
"When, lo! a Lady, lithe of limb,
Appeared, and she enlightened him
In less than half a minute.
A Dame was she of high estate,
And ultra-feminine loquacity;
Her port was proud, her glance elate,
Her faith was very very great,
And so was her audacity.
She said, "Much-quoted Peter Bell,
Behold this flower of brimstone hue!
Our dear Endymion loved it well.
And none shall ring Old England's knell
Whilst to its tint we 're true."
"Dear me!" cried Peter, "can that be?
I must indeed be very dull, for
I really really cannot see
How we Bhall owe security
To that faint blob of sulphur."
"Oh, Peter, Peter!" cried the Dame,
"How very right was Rydal's bard!
But I '11 explain our little game.
Then, if your heart is not aflame,
It mast be awfully hard."
She told him how that yellow flower
Was poor old England's latest hope;
The last palladium of her power,
Her shield from Rad revolt's red shower,
From Gladstone and the Pope.
She showed how Radicals would smirch
The flag of England, swiftly, surely;
She told how our beloved Church
Was like to be left in the lurch
By Chamberlain and Morley.
She showed our fundamental laws,
Sapped by insidious pamphlets, crumb-
ling;
And champions of the Good Old Cause
In Anarchy's devouring jaws
Precipitately tumbling.
She poured upon his shuddering soul
Disastrous news in this or that form;
111 tidings of such dismal dole
Might draw a hermit from his hole,
A Duchess to a platform.
"Good gracious, Madam!" Peter cried,
"This really is extremely shocking.
How are you going to provide
Against tne ghouls in spectral tide
Around your country flocking?"
"Oh, Peter, Peter, are you blind?"
She cried. "Those spectres crowd in
dim rows,
And menace us; but never mind:
Thanks to Endymion, we shall find
Salvation in the Primrose!"
"Well, well. Friend Wordsworth's
observation"
(Thus mused our philosophio Peter)
"Caused me much mental tribulation.
But now I've got an explanation,
And what could be completer?
"A primrose by a river's brim,
Or, better, at a lady's breast,
Henceforth will make my spirit swim
By adumbrations vast, though dim,
And scarce to be exprest!
And Peter, though wild rumours float
That he is still a " Bturnd party,"
Now wears the Primrose in his coat,
And yields to it, by speech and vote,
Allegiance true and hearty.

We hear nowadays a great deal about
"dry plates" in connection with photo-
graphy, perhaps this may be intended as a
specimen of a photographer's dry humour.
That anyone could see views instantaneously
near Portland Street (Isn't it Portland Road ?)
Station, we can readily admit. But how the
"briny" is to be photographed in that loca-
lity, unless it is sent up from Brighton in
casks, it is difficult to understand. The Ocean
is known, on the best authority, to be " the
blue, the fresh, the ever free "—but we doubt
if it will ever be free enough to reaoh Port-
land Road. Perchance some day we may
encounter "breakers ahead" in the Mary-
lebone Road. By the way, we did one day.
only they were " stone-breakers ahead," and
the road was "up," and our horse wasjlown

OUR EXCHANGE AND MART.
TO POULTRY FANCIERS AND OTHERS.—A Brood of WILD
TURKEYS for disposal. A Gentleman, a professed epicure,
of artiatio tastes, who with a view to giving a series of banquets to
his intimate friends, has recently had a consignment of these cele-
brated birds forwarded to him from one of the Western States of
Amerioa, is now, owing to want of nerve and leisure to devote his
attention properly to their keep and management, desirous of parting
with them in exchange for their value in secondhand photographs, or
an equivalent in Cranberry Jam. Together with the birds, that are
as yet quite untamed, and in fine savage condition, the Advertiser
will include in the exohange a leathern leg-and-face protector, padded
gloves, half-a-dozen Hospital tickets, double-handed crow-bar, and
feeding tongs, for the purpose of approaching them at meal-times. On
view daily, through the top of the coal-oellar, on the premises. West-
ville House, Padding-ton Park, W. N.B.—Could be easily removed
with the aid of chloroform, under suitable precautions, in a
furniture van.
TO THE DEAF AND MUSICAL.—An Inventor, who has
devoted the last seventeen years of his life to the construction
of a " Symphonikon," or Self-acting Steam Organ, having, owing to
the seizure, at the last moment, of the whole of the treble and naif
the bellows for arrears of rent, been left with the bottom five base
notes on his hands, is open to entertain an offer for them, on reason-
able terms. As, when turned on even at half power, they emit a
dear deep bellowing sound that deafeas the performer, and shakes
the house with its vibration, they might either be found useful to a
student hard of hearing wishing to familiarise himself with a portion
of the left-hand scale, or still better, serve as a permanent fog-signal
attached to a light-house on a dangerous coast. Might be utilised by
a village choir aocustomed to the use of limited plain chant. As the
piping would also be serviceable as hot-water apparatus, the repre-
sentatives of public baths and wash-houses might communicate.
SIKES ON SELF-HELP.

Receivers of the same.

I chooses to pursue:
So, oonseqvently, all ljcan

TO THE BENEVOLENTLY DISPOSED.—An Indian Chief for
Adoption. The Secretary of an Aborigines Protection Society
that has recently collapsed for want of funds, but has left him in
oharge of a Warrakiri Islander for whom he has no room in his
family circle, is desirous of meeting with some philanthropic person
willing to take him off his hands. The Chief, who is understood to
be descended from a long line of Ocean Kings, and whose outfit con-
sists of a dozen pots of war-paint in two colours, a tomahawk, fifteen
long spears, a throat-knife, and the skin of a bison for Sunday wear,
would be found willing to make himself generally useful in an
athletic household from whioh he could occasionally enjoy the run of
a London Square. As in his native country he has been in the habit
of performing the carving-knife feat and turning a double somer-
sault backwards over the heads of six high-priests together, his
services might, if not available at an East End Music Hall, be pos-
sibly acceptable to a childless and aged couple who wished to enliven
their declining years by a little daily after-dinner recreation and
exoitement. Can be lodged comfortably in a dust-bin. Small bonus.
For further particulars, and inspection, apply, efficiently protected
by police, at the Secretary's Office, 293, Poultry, E.C.
ZOOLOGICAL AND EDUCATIONAL.—An Invalid Nobleman
having, as Residuary Legatee under the will of a distant
Colonial relative, succeeded to the possession of a couple of mammoth
Rattlesnakes that he is anxious to keep, but has not the health or
ability properly to domesticise, wishes to meet with some expe-
rienced person who would be willing to act in the capacity of
Charmer, and reduce them to reasonable control. As the Advertiser
had, with the assistance of his family circle and the police,
managed to get pillow-cases over their heads, and pursuing them
with a Chinese gong, induced them to take refuge inside the draw-
ing-room grand piano—from which, however, they subsequently
escaped in a somnolescent condition—it is not calculated that they
will give muoh trouble to a thoroughly experienced Tamer
accustomed to their ways, and well provided with proper antidotes.
As they are at present ooiled about the central chandelier, hissing,
and making frequent darts at any one attempting to dislodge them

fortable service of five o'olock tea, as early an application for the

speak, coming in. English audiences have had enough of Irish
grievances for some time. When I ask ten guineas " in advance,"
tiey reply that they will willingly pay ten guineas for me to keep
away. Discouraging. Abo rather alarming. Irish Patriot has his
Sersonal expenses, like other people, and how is he to pay his laun-
ress if Home Rule lecture not appreciated?
Therefore pleased at unexpected invitation to Oxford—always
thought it was home of old-fangled Toryism, landlordism, clericalism,
and tnat sort of thing. Evidently young Oxford going to alter all that.
Get to Thingummy College. Nobody waiting at gates to receive me.
Porter suspicious. Says the young gen'lemen are at 'All," and
asks me to wait in poky little anteroom till they've done. I ask what
"Hall" is? Porter looks at me pityingly, and says it means dinner.
Dinner! Well, aren't they going to give me a dinner? How's
Irish Patriot to live if people don't give him free dinners P Send in
my card to President of College Debating Society, with message that
"I only had hasty lunch before leaving Town. He must take the
hint, I think.
He does. Says " he's sorry to hear I've had no dinner, but it |s
against College rules to ask stranger to Hall without putting his
name down beforehand." Wants me to "wine" with him after
Hall.
This is not exactly the sort of treatment I expected. Inwardly

the young Oxonians coming out from their dinner. President of
Debating Society shakes hands with me warmly. He appears to
have been dining heartily—wish I had. Is uncommonly merry.
Takes me off to his rooms. Gives me wine, cake, and fruit, and no
end of cigars. Pitch into the cake, as sort of compensation for
having no dinner. Curious that nobody else seems to come to this
"wine." Always heard that College "wines" were such festive
gatherings.
Say so to host. He seems embarrassed. Says the fact is the
Dons are so stupid, they think an Irish Patriot, who's an ex-convict,
"and that sort of thing," is not fit company for the young men of
the College. Apologises profusely for prejudices of the Authorities,
whom he calls "Old Stick-in-the muds." Says "he himself will
probably be gated for a week " for bringing an Irish Patriot (myself)
inside College. Seems sad, but determined. Quite pity the poor
young man. Wonder whether my ten guineas is safe. Would it be
best to ask for it in advance P Suppose the Dons forcibly prevent
this young man from parting with the ten guineas to an Irish
Patriot! Where would an I. P. be then t
President says it's time to go to Debating Room. Walking along
Quadrangle, flower-pot dropped from an upper window—narrowly
escaping my head.. President merely says, Ah!" as if this were
quite an ordinary occurrence, and gives sickly smile. Says "Some
men in the College are up to no end of practical jokes." Don't
like this sort of practical joke at all.

Oxford Street, and all the hotels shut! Where is the President
of the College Debating Society? Where, above all, is my ten
guineas? Wonder if an Irish landlord feels like this when he
hasn't been paid any rent? Always did protest against eviction—
shall protest against it more than ever now. Nothing for it now but
to claim police protection, and hope to goodness friends in Ireland
won't ever hear of it.*

EVENINGS FROM HOME.
A "Music Hall" appears to be a place where you hear the least
possible amount of "music" properly so called. There is singing of
a kind which requires little voice, but there are popular tunes, good
character-acting, topical songs, ventriloquism, feats of strength, and
exhibitions of various kinds of acrobatio skill. It is just what the
French call it, a Cafe" Chantant. The Alhambra has a first-rate
orchestra, and does not come within the category of Musio Halls,
calling itself the Theatre of Varieties—which is a very elastio term.
If there were at the Pavilion, which just now may be fairly taken
as the representative Cafe Chantant, or Musio Hall, of London, an
introduction of glee-singing by first-rate choristers, then the enter-
tainment miifht be fairly styled the best possible in the best of all
possible Music Halls, that is as far as I am personally acquainted
with such possibilities.
The advantage which a Music Hall, as a free-and-easy sort of
evening amusement for men from Club-land, possesses over most
theatrical entertainments, is, that it does not necessitate the commis-
sion of .any such grave irregularity in the dinner-hour as brings its
own punishment swiftly and surely. Where, I should like to know,
is the piece that can repay the regular eight o'clock diner for taking
his meal at the barbarous hour of six or six-thirty? Once in the
year this change must be made, on Boxing-night, for the Pantomime;
but then Christmas week is altogether exceptional, and one upset,
more or less, of the system does not count in the general derangement
of the mince-pie and. plum-pudding saturnalia. There is no piece on
the Stage that can restore the disturbed diner's peace—of mind. For
such a disturbance there is no compensation. Only those who are
habitually early diners and late supperers can be serious playgoers:
but such as these, among the upper and the upper-middle classes, are
comparatively few.
"Drop in when you like," says the Music-Hall Proprietor.
"There s sure to be something going on that '11 amuse you, and you
can enjoy your cigar and cup of coffee, or what you will, wnile
listening to and seeing the performers."
It is a pleasant form of invitation, and you need not see the entire
entertainment in one nig^ht, but take it in bits, and have a little of it
at a time. The entertainment at a Music Hall does not depend for
its success on any such continuity of purpose as is necessary to a
play. Yon can take it up at any one point without wishing to know
what has preceded it, or feeling any curiosity as to what is to follow.
A man who became a student of literature late in life, and began
reading Johnson'$ Dictionary, complained that the style was jerky
and the interest not well sustained, but that there were parts of it
which were really excellent reading for a leisure hour. And so it is
with the Music-Hall programme.
There are twenty different items of amusement in the Pavilion
programme, and the_ late gentleman, who pays the highest for the
privilege of coming in when he likes, may dine, if it so pleases him,
in the neighbourhood, say at the Cafe Royal, where he can have a

he can talk French to the Waiters, imagine himself in Paris, with
none of the risks of crossing, and

song, and see the Sisters Elvira and Gisella on overhead wires.
For my part, I am glad that I did not miss King Cole and his merry
men, whose inimitable ventriloquism is as marvellous and as amusing
as ever. His puppets are quite old friends. I almost fancy that
wicked old reprobate with the bottle-nose recognises me with his
stony eye. It is impossible that we should ever be on "speaking
terms," and so we do not nod to one another.
Paul Cinquevalli's performance is as wonderful as it is graceful;
and when afterwards he reappears with two big
brothers, and chucks them about like
nine-pins, I begin to realise what a
useful man Mr. Cinquevalli would be
in a street row, or to deal with an
unwelcome intruder. M. Wainbatta's
performance on the
slack-wire—which wob-
bles about as if it were
a rather "tight"rope—
is both clever and
humorous. Mr. Mac-

enjoy his Chelsea song,

a "go" about The

which is irresistible. Then came Madame Garetta and her pretty
pigeon exhibition; and then Mr. Jakes Fawn, who, in his way, is a
Buckstone Redivivus, came on and sang " / did it with genuinely
broad humour.
I hope the Pa-vilion does pay Yillxers; and if a crowded and appre-
ciative audience is evidence of the fact, it was patent on the night
we were there. "We" means our party, which included my Maiden
Aunt from Dampshire, who had come up to hear an
Oratorio. She brought her fan with her, and we
seated her snugly in a corner behind the curtain of
a private box. She refused to accept our assurance
that the Great Macdebjiott was Mr. Santley, or
that Arthur Lloyd was Sims Reeves. She was
not perfectly satisfied with her position until we
pointed out to her the Royal Box, and finally left
the building by the side entrance which is set apart
for the visit of Illustrious Personages. "If they
patronise it, I can," said my Aunt, and we left it
at this, without giving her any more detailed infor-
mation: but a Music-Hall entertainment will not
suit all Maiden Aunts from the country. If there is
one sign of prosperity more striking than another,
it is the glossy, curly-brimmed hat, and under it,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

TO BE RECTIFIED.
Sir— I have never been inside the House of Commons, but it does
seem to be highly disrespectful, and very thoughtless on the part of
the architect, not to have provided a proper seat for the Heir to the
Throne when he visits the House. My indignation was excited by
reading this:—
"The Prince of Wales was present in
the House of Commons last night to hear
Lord Charles Beresford's speech on the
Navy. The Prince occupied a seat over the
clock."
Or was it like this ?—

Either would make a good notion for a time-piece to mark the
epoch, and the figure of fl.R.H. might be mechanical, to move the
arms and eyes; but in any case I sincerely trust that the faithful
Commons will see to this, and not again oii'end the loyal susceptibi-
lities of Yours truly, Dum Crambo Crambo.
SOME MORE "SOCIAL PROBLEMS."
(Not by Mr. Qeorge.)
Just heard that Uncle James has left me all his money! What a
responsibility! Am almost ashamed to inquire how much it is.
Really, afraid I may be a Capitalist, after all. And I have
always been so bitter against Capitalists! Hope it isn't a Million.
Uncle James's Solicitor just called. Find that Uncle James has left
me not one Million, but two and a half! This is worse and worse.
Curious how instantaneously the knowledge of my increase of wealth
seems to spread. Already received pressing letters from—
1. Income-Tax Commissioners. 2. My deceased third cousin's
enormous and shockingly impecunious family. 3. Any number of
friends (with marriageable daughters) who want me to go and dine
with them, Just in a quiet way! 4. All the Charitable Societies in
London. 5. All the needy vagabonds in Great Britain. 6. All the
swindling lotteries in Europe.
Uncle James's Solicitor says he has a nice little country box down
in Hampshire, and offers "to put me up there whenever I like to
come." Very nice of him. Solicitor's real business with me is to say,
what he forgot before, that a man of my wealth and position—(Fancy
having "a position! What a nuisance. Such an awkward posi-
tion too!V-ought not to lose a day before making some "testa-
mentary disposition of his real and personal property." In other
words, Solicitor wants me to make my will—or rather, wants to make
it for me. Think it's rather bad taste of Solicitor to mention subject
of will. Tell him I '11 think the matter over.
Have thought it over. Feel it would be inconsistent with all my
convictions and professions (especially the latter) to regard myself
as entitled to more than small modicum of Uncle James's money.
Question is— how much exactly is mine, and how much is Society's?
And when that point is settled, in what way am I to distribute that
portion belonging to Society? Last question seems absurd, because
if it belongs to Society, surely Society is the person to distribute it,
and not L But then, as a matter of fact, I happen to have the
money, owing to that stupid convention which says it belongs to me;
and so after all I'm afraid I shall have to resign myself to the bother
of giving away a large sum which isn't properly mine at all. Have
always prided myself on acting from principle—difficulty here is that
I don't quite know on what principle to act.
Devote myself to serious study of Political Economy as bearing on
problem of proper distribution of wealth.
After two sleepless nights and a day of intense thought, fancy I've
elaborated a just method of disposing of my property by will. Send
for Solicitor.
"If A. (I tell him) represents my whole wealth"
Solicitor suggests available assets" instead of " wealth," which
sounds as if I were a Bankrupt.
"And B. (I go on) the amount I've decided to devote to charitable
oses." _
Solicitor interrupts me. He hopes, in tone of deep anxiety, I 'm
not going to "allow myself to be swindled by a lot of begging
Societies." Tells me that " charity begins at home," and wishes to
know if I've got no relatives?
I reply that I'm thinking of leaving £50,000 to each of my deceased
third cousin's thirteen children, as a pleasant little surprise."
By a rapid process of mental calculation Solicitor sees that this
disposes, at one blow, of £650,000. Asks if " I really mean to be so
uncommonly generous to such distant connections?"
I explain to him that it isn't generosity at all, only justice, and
that really and truly I've no moral title whatever to Uncle James's
property.
Solicitor seems surprised and pained. He won't discuss the ques-
tion, but looks at me rather strangely. Fancy he thinks me a little
cracked; but quite approves of a "considerable sum"—I put it
vaguely like that, because I'm really afraid of mentioning a figure
which will further irritate Solicitor—being devoted to Lord Mayor's
Fund for Belief of Unemployed.
I suggest that with remaining money I might do something for better
housing of working-men. Something like Somebody's Buildings,
in fact. Solicitor more doubtful than before. Says he's heard—but
he mentions matter under all reserve, and without prejudice—that
Somebody's Buildings are, well, not a failure, but only a drop in the
ocean, as it were. Advises me to reconsider whole subject, and gets
up to leave. Says I " want cheerful society," invites me again to
to his shooting-box, and mentions, quite casually, that his wife is
expecting "one or two lovely ^irls to stop with her next week.
Problem of Proper Distribution of Wealth is becoming darker than
ever!
"WHY AM I A SUCCESS?"
From Mr. J. L. T—le.—Because friend Irving was jealous of
me, and wouldn't let me do the Ohost, Macduff, and Faust at the
Lyceum.
From Mr. W-ls-n B-rr-tt.—Because I saw Charles Kean, as
a lad, from the Princess's gallery, and consequently took to swearing.
Because the Public prefer me to Irving. Because I am the actual
Author of Messrs. Herman, Jones, and Sydney Grundy's original
plays. Because I have invariably refused to be photographed.
From Lord W-ls-l-y.—Because, in spite of being a Viscount,
I have generally employed a Peer, or the relative of a Peer, to carry
home despatches. Because, in recounting my victories, I closely fol-
lowed the style of my friend Mr. Augustus Harris. Because I hate
"rings," and have set my face against encouraging a titled clique.
Because, when after all is said and done, I am really and truly—
indeed I am—the only General.

draws. Because I Know how to attract by eccentricity as instanced

refused to allow me to become a Christy Minstrel in spite of my pro-
ficiency in nigger-songs, and performing on the bones or tambourine.
Because everybody likes my collars. Because the "Grand Old
Man" was a capital title. Because ■

Of Michael,—not "Angelo."—The Daily News, in a leaderette
on the Davitt affair, at Oxford, said: "Oxford is one of the last homes
of hospitality. The old rule of hospitality was, that if your enemy
reached your hearth, and took his place there, he was safe for the
night." The Daily News then went on to say:—
"The same rule holds even in Fiji. Some years ago an English naval officer,
lost in the mountains of Fiji, went straight up to the hut of a chief and was
in securitv till after sunrise. He was hospitably treated, and a female slave
enabled him to escape during the night. After sunrise he would have been
killed and probably eaten. Similar hospitality should prevail at Oxford."
Did the Daily News wish to imply that the Oxonians ought to have
killed and eaten Michael Davitt after sunrise! It seems that with-
out even having been "roasted," Michael DAvrrr went down with
them very well.
A Precocius Critic.—Fbancisque Sarcey, the well-known French
dramatic critic, lately wrote in the Temps, " Quandje suis entre
dans la critique, il y a plus d'un demi-siecle." Whereupon the
Figaro reckons it up thns:—" M. Sarcey was born in 1828; we are
in 1886. Therefore, if M. Sarcy commenced his career as a critic
fifty years ago, he must have done so in 1836, when he was eight
years old!" What an infant phenomenon! A juvenile critic, not to
be got at with " chicken and champagne," but amenable to reason in
the shape of buns, oranges, toffy, and ginger-beer. The Criticising
Boy must have been very cheeky," and always " sarcy."

Ben Thovato.—Mile. Rejane was brushing up her English in order
to repeat that poem in honour of the Prinoe of Wales's visit to Paris
the other day. "Tell me," she said to a friend who knew something
about our language. "Is not 'Galles' another word for 'Young
Ladies' in English? "Parfaitement," was the unhesitating reply.
"A la bonne heure !" exclaimed Mile. Rejane. "Comme toutes les
femmes adorent sonAltesse.—Ah !—Je comprends!" And, perhaps,
she added this to the poem.

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Howe of Commons, Monday Night, March 15.—H.R.H. down
to-night, looking uncommonly well. Came to hear Chablie Beres-
ford discuss British Navy. Charlie in great form. Told us not
only all about Navy, which it seems is still steaming, as it used to
sail, to the dogs, but lightly handled National Debt.
"Why not pay off Debt in hundred-and-two years instead of
hundred?" he asked. And, when you come to think of it, why not?
Charlie's opinion of the Fleet generally not high. Indeed, he told
House he had felt it his duty to inform the Russian Minister that,
"Had we gone into the Baltic, and the Russians had one man there
with a head on, he ought to have blown the British Fleet out of the
water." But his contempt for gunboats was almost unspeakable.
"Sir," he said, to the Speaker, "a smart Frenchman or Russian
would go and mop the whole lot up."
"I call," he a little later cried, in stentorian tones, "for twenty
more cruisers, three torpedo dipot ships, twenty-one torpedo boats of
the Grasshopper class, and forty torpedo boats of the fourth class."
Pretty to see excitement on Treasury Bench, as noble Lord made
these demands. Gladstone, with characteristic wiliness, pretended
to be asleep. But'Harcourt moved restlessly on Bench, feeling in
all his pockets, and at last vigorously hauling out something.
Thought it was at least a torpedo boat of the Grasshopper class.
Turned out to be only pockethandkerchief.
Much interest was excited by speech of Reed. Last Session, in
succession to several other Sessions, Reed moved Resolution much
like that Charlie to-night breezily advocated. A Minister now
and bound to defend Estimates. How would he do it? With much
presence of mind. It was true that last year he had brought forward
such a Motion. But " things had greatly improved since then."
"Yes," said Plunket, "Reed's been made a Lord of the
Admiralty."
Getting in bad way about laughter. Grand Cross on memorable
occasion "heard an Hon. Member smile." Now Lord George
Hamilton has discovered a new offence. Accused Harcourt of
laughing. Harcourt said it wasn't him. Another fellow.
Then," said Lord George, sternly, "it was the reflection of a
lausrh which I saw on the face of the Right Hon. Gentleman."
What are we coming to when we are not to smile lest we wake an
ex-Home Secretary, and not to laugh lest the reflection be cast on
another man's face?
Earlier in Sitting some sensation created by Captain Verney jump-
ing up and moving Adjournment of House to discuss "matter of
urgent public importance." No New Member had been placed on
Procedure Committee, and this was the matter of urgent public im-
portance Vernet wanted to discuss. Excellent idea! New Members
who are always walking about with their hats on, passing between
Member on his legs and Speaker, attempting to address the Chair
from the middle of the floor, calling the Speaker " Mr. Chairman,"
and addressing the House as " Gentlemen"; who make their maiden
speeches in moving Votes of Want of Confidence on the Address, and
who are alwavs getting in the wrong lobby—these are the very men
to give valuable assistance in Committee on Procedure. Oddly enough
not forty men, nor yet one, rose to support the Motion for Adjourn-
ment, and Vernet sat down, looking slightly sheepish.
Business done.—Navy Estimates.
Tuesday.—Never so astonished in my life!
Walking down (Corridor by House of Lords,
upon Bishop of Peterborough with coat
off, shirt-sleeves turned up, spar-
ring away at imaginary foe.
'' What's the matter, my Lord P'1
I said, halting at safe distance,
for even Bishops sometimes go
mad. "Having it out with some-
body?"
'' No, Toby," he replied, breath-
lessly. "11's a little nabit of mine
when I'm going to make a speech.
Warms up the blood, gets your
musoles in order, and excites the
imagination. Going to say a few
words on Pew-rents. The Clergy
who have pews to sell don't like
notion of interference. Very well.
Imagine Clergy who have
pews to sell all rolled up in
one figure. Fetch the figure
out here, where I thought no
one would be passing, and
then walk into it. An idea of my own. Mightn't suit everybody,
but useful to me. Feel in fine form now." And the Bishop rolled down
his sleeves, and put on his coat. "Better come in, and near me."
Went with pleasure. Know no man better able to give an adver-
sary what the Marchioness called " a one'er " than Petebborough.
A capital speech, full of fire and righteous fury, with reminiscence
of the little preliminary practice in the Corridor. Told a good story,
too. A stranger was put in pew of devout parishioner. Service
over, pew-owner burst into Vestry, and complained to parson.
"I didn't desire," he said. "to disturb service bv turning him out
of the pew, but I took the liberty of sitting on his hat."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Selborne, observing precaution of getting Granville between
him and the Bishop, attempted to meet his argument. Up jumped
the passionate Peterborough.
"1 did not say that!" he thundered.
"I thank God," said Selborne, with pious fervour, taking
another step backward, "that
I have not the right reverend
prelate's oratorical power."
Ah, but if he'd only seen
him in the Corridor just now!
Business done. — In Com-
mons the C. D. Acts repealed.
Wednesday.— Exhilarating
afternoon in society of Scotch
Members. One of them (Fin-
lay) brought in a Bill dealing
with Church matters; the
others gathered together and
tore it to pieces, clawing at
each other meanwhile. At-
tendance wonderfully well
kept up, considering subject
of debate. But at one time
fell so manifestly short of
quorum that a Count was
called.
The fragments of Finlay's
Bill oarried out and decently
buried, Rider Cook moved

ing with Theatres. Rider, a
New Member, and this great
opportunity. He'd show the

would be safo to leave the House while he bers thought too much ot

away, got it hot, and then got it hotter their eye on Rider. Got on
from the Spen Valley Constituency, which swimmingly. Masterly expo-
was unrepresented in the Division List on sition Of details of Bill.

"I say, look here! Mr. Chairman, don't you know," said Rider,
"I haven't finished telling you what Mr. Irving said."
"Order! order!" cried Speaker, more impressively. "Order!
order!" shouted those Old Members, vindictively, and Rider sat
down. He had talked his own Bill out. Business done.—Church of
Scotland Bill rejected by 202 votes against 177.
Thursday.—Ashmead-Bartlett, though a
little eccentric in politics, is at heart good
fellow. lias no necessity now of securing seat
by coming down early and putting hat on
bench. Open therefore to oblige his friends.
Few things more interesting than to see him
enter House about Three o'clock
with four or five hats piled
pyramid-fashion on his head,
and one in either hand. Old
game with glass of water now
comes to his assistance. Used,
when about to make a speech, to
bring in couple of glasses of
water in his hat, carrying them
so dexterously that no one
guessed what he was up to. Just
beginning to be able to fetch in
three tumblers, when made a
Minister. Can go along now at
a trot with seven hats, and rarely
comes to grief. Plants them"
out here and there, obliging
seven friends.
Navy Estimates on to-night. Brilliant speech from IIiubert. A
few remarks from Charlie Beresford. OB. coming out as a Par-
liamentary orator. In training for First Lordship of the Admiralty.
Told a good story, illustrating difference between soldiers and
blue- jackets. After the Duke of Edinburgh had been shot at
in Australia, a double row of blue-jacket sentries were placed around
the house he stayed at; every man strictly enjoined to remain at his
post, to challenge three times any who approached, and, receiving

no answer, to fire. There was an emu in the garden, who approached
one of the blue-jackets. Blue-jacket challenged emu three times.
"Of course," said Charlie, anxious to omit no detail, "the emu
didn't answer;" whereupon the blue-jacket fired, and every man of
the double row of sentries came running to the spot.
"There you are, you know," said C. B., confidentially, to the
Chairman; "a soldier will stick to his post, a sailor will run wherever
he thinks he's wanted."
Dulness of Committee on the Navy Estimates threatened by signs
of mutiny on part of Captain Field. Gallant Captain has profes-
sional contempt for the late Secretary to the Admiralty, who is some-
thing in the sugar business. "I have," he said, glaring down upon
Ritchie, "a great respect for him!when he's dealing with sugar,
but I haven't the same confidence when he's dealing with salt."
Grand Cross thought he heard a smile.
Business done.—Navy Estimates.
Friday.—Always treat to hear Lord Bramwell, whether right or
wrong. A man who's got a mind, and isn't diffident about express-
ing its convictions. Never, that I know of, heard an elephant
trampling through a jungle, said Rosebert; "but whenever I
listen to Lord Bramwell trampling through a jungle of prejudices,
always think of the elephant. He's so grim, so unconcerned for
the feelings of those who get in his way. He's going somewhere—
and he goes."
To-night bent upon going to the Museums on a Sunday, and
growled his way thither, causing the Bishops visibly to shudder as
he talked lightly of "the Book of Sports, and left some doubt in
the mind whether he didn't read the newspapers on Sunday.
A terrible man—more fitted for rough company in House of .Commons
than for the serene atmosphere of the House of Lords, where
Bishops sit in lawn sleeves, and shake their heads over the mi-
episcopalian vigour of "brother Peterborough."
Business done.—In Lords, Lord Thurlow's Motion, Opening
Museums on Sunday, oarried by 76 votes against 62. In Commons,
none.
GOING OUT OF FASHION.
(A Chronological Table for the Future.)
1886. End of the Italian Opera at Her Majesty's.
1887. Supplementary and Final Exhibition at South Kensington.
1888. Last University Boat-race on the Thames.
1889. Abolition of the Westminster Play.
1890. Sale of Burlington House, and breaking up of the Royal
Academy.
1891. Cricket at Lord's and the Oval is discontinued.
1892. Completion of the Hyde Park Estate on the site of Rotten
Row and the Ladies' Mile.
1893. Commemoration at Oxford held for the last time.
1894. Yachting given up at Ryde and Cowes. Last Derby and
Leger.
1895. The " Lancers" only danoed at the Court Ball before the
demolition of Buckingham Palace.
1896. Drury Lane and Covent Garden pulled down.
1897. Dinners cease in Hall at Lincoln's Inn, the Temples, and
Gray's Inn.
1898. Feeble anecdotes prohibited in the Law Courts. Retire-
ment of Baron Huddlestone.
1899. Suspension of Beer-making.
1900. Abolition of Skittles!
A WILD SUGGESTION.
"That strange Body, the Court of Common Counoil," as Charles
Dickens once described them, are becoming both wise and witty in
their old age. When Mr. Alderman Isaacs, who ought to know
better, proposed that the new Tower Bridge should be made of British
Iron, regardless of cost, the Court, we are told, carried "the pre-
vious question," by a large majority, and one Member threatened
that had the proposition to exclude all Foreign Iron been carried, he
would have moved, as an addition thereto, that all Foreign Wines
and Foreign Turtle be excluded from the Mansion House! What
would our good friend " Robert" have said to this "hawful prop-
posal?"
What an imagination it requires to conceive the bold Member's
idea being carried out! With the Mock Turtle a nice glass of pure
Ginger Wine instead of the customary Madeira, Cowslip Wine with
the Fish, Sparkling Gooseberry with the Entries, a nice glass of old
Rhubarb with the Game, some fine old crusty Elder with the Cheese,
and plenty of Special Margo Red Currant, bottled in 1885, with the
Dessert!
We wonder how many Royal Princes, and really good Judges,
would pay a second visit to the Mansion House under such truly
patriotic conditions.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MAD AS A-LUNACY BILL!"
Sense. My good British Public, I think you have recently taken up the
amendment of the Lunacy Laws with a great deal of zeal.
Sensibility. Certainly I have; because I believe they require alteration, espe-
cially as regards private "Licensed Houses."
Sense. Do you know what a " Lioensed House" is like?
Sensibility. Not particularly; but I have a general impression that it is a place
where patients are kept for the unholy gain of unscrupulous men.
Sense. And you consider that a Public Asylum would be infinitely preferable?
Sensibility. Being equally ignorant of the character of Public Asylums, I
reply. Certainly.
Sense. Would you be surprised to hear that a Licensed House relies upon the
cure of its patients for its success? That it must be kept up to a standard of
excellence fixed by the six medical and legal gentlemen called the Commissioners
in Lunacy, who are constantly inspecting it, and the Resident Medical Officer,
whose appointment they have authorised, and that upon their good opinion (subject
to an appeal to the Lord Chancellor) it retains its licence; and that, conse-
quently, every individual patient has necessarily far more attention devoted to
him than is customary, or even possible, in a Public Asylum?
Sensibility. I was not aware of these facts.
Sense. Are you sure that a vast Institution, containing hundreds of patients,
who attract as much as, but no more interest than the inmates of a Parish Work-
house, in charge of a Superintendent, and perhaps a couple of assistants, having
infinitely more freedom than the Superintendents of Licensed Houses, will be better
conducted than a Private Asylum, wherein, from the highest to the lowest, every
official is personally interested in the welfare, good management, and high repu-
tation of the establishment with which he is connected?
Sensibility. Putting it in that light, the "Licensed House" would be better.
Sense. And are you aware that some hundreds of thousands of pounds have
been invested in these Lioensed Houses, representing in some cases the savings of
a lifetime of a father for his orphan children, and that the Bill, if it becomes
law in its unremodelled form, will rob these children of the provision thus left
to them?
Sensibility. Impossible! For that would not be fair.
Sense. Do you not know that not only is it proposed to make a licenoe cease
with the lifetime of the present holder, but also that it is already a question
(even before the Bill has passed) whether a licence that has been left to a dead
man's children for more than a dozen years, is not to cease immediately, and be
lost to them for ever, because during a few months of that time it has been held
by some one else for them in trust, and not by them in person?
Sensibility. But surely that is against equity?
Sense. Yes, and what is against equity should not become law. Moreover, are
you aware that the regulations in this eccentric measure are of such a penal cha-
racter that all good men will most probably be driven away from the study of
mental disease, for fear of being turned unconsciously into felons, misdemeanants,
or, at any rate, defendants, to be mulcted in heavy damages, and that conse-
quently psychology will possibly fall into the hands of simpletons and quacks?
Sensibility. I nave not read the olauses of the Bill, but—dear me!
Sense. And., under all these circumstances, do you not think that a measure
thus carrying so much reckless damage both to the sane and insane, if it becomes
law, should be called not the Lunacy, but the Lunatic Act?
Sensibility. Unquestionably!
SOME RECENT CONCERTS.
Gounod's Mors et Vita, at the Crystal Palace, attracted an unusually large
audience. But the Oratorio is so long—Mors the pity—that it should hardly be
offered in its entirety at a single sitting. As it consists of three distinctive parts,
it might well be given serially. Issue it in numbers, and the public will be more
likely to take it in. The greatest praise is due to Bond and Chorus. The Manns
the Manns for a' that.
A pianoforte recital, with songs by Mrs. Hutchinson and Miss Hope Glenn,
was announced to be given last week, at Kensington Town Hall, by Seflor A. Cok-
de-Lass. Accord el tut! tut—Accordingly I went. The Spanish Grandee is a
fine pianist, and played without either notes or affectation—I suppose upon a Spanish
Grandee piano. Particularly did he excel in Chopin's music, of which he rendered
unhackneyed and very difficult selections. An impromptu of his own would have
taken any one else years to compose, but his ideas are not forced, though he does
come from a Conservatory. N.B,.—What a splendid chance for a Negro Comedian
attending the Concert, to say, with a chuckle, on getting home, that he "just
cor de lass train!"
Miss Agnes Zimmermann, and a Broad wood Piano, monopolised the platform of
Prince's Hall, on the afternoon of March 25th. Two hours is a long time in which to
listen to the uninterrupted strains of a piano, howsoever well it maybe smitten:
and though Miss Zimmermann plays divinely, one or two, if not more, of us would
like to have heard a few songs between whiles. Son?s trith words, I mean; and
would it be irreverent to ask whether Sullivan or Cowen is not as classical as the
hybrid composer Schubert-Tausig?
The twenty-third public Concert of the Bach Choir, erstwhile presided over by
Mr. Otto Goldschmtdt, but now conducted by Dr. Villiees Stantobd, was too
tempting to be missed—at least the crowded audience seemed to think so. Herr
•Io.a cm m played the violin in a Concerto of his own composing, and in a Chaeonne
by Bach. The latter work is more surprisingly difficult than pleasing to the ordinary
listener—but then " Chaeonne d son gout." NrBBELUNGtET.

"LETTERS TO DEAD ATJTHOBS."
Letters to Dead Authors is reading mighty fine,
Writ by Andrew Lang to the scribes of auld lang syne.
The living Author seems to write just as it takes his whim,
So sometimes it appears as if the dead 'uns wrote to him.
Some are bright, and some are light, and others gay or
solium,
And Messrs. Longmans of the lot, have made a pretty
wollum.

Oh, the agony!

'Gainst the writer of this Mac-millancholy tale.
There's only one bit that's worth reading—no more—
Of a Nun, and a knife, and a Duke, and a boar.
Fill up my flagon! a
Farewell to Dagonet!
DOBSON, BY GOSSE!
Poet Punch offers a sincere tribute of admiration to
Poet G08SE and Poet Dobson. It is his own ignorance
(one cannot attend to everything) that prevented him,
till now, from being fully aware of the established claims
of these Poets to the meed of immortality. Tennyson
he knew—and Browning he knew—but who were Dob-
son and Gosse? He stands rebuked, however, before
Poet Gosse's more royal self-estimate.
Exegi monumentum core perennius.
I have erected a monument more durable than brass,
said, of himself, one Horace once, and he turned out to
be right. But Bards have not been so cock-sure since
then, till Poet Gosse arose. Even thus, in a new volume,
writes Poet Gosse to Poet Dobson :—
Brother not more kind to brother,
We have cheered and helped each other:
Till so far the fields of each
Into the other's stretch and reach,
That, perchance, when both are gone,
Neither may be named alone!
Remark the simple modesty, and the simpler humour.
Both poets are so like, that an admiring world will not
know tother from which. So far, Poet Gosse, the Court
is rather with you. Our acquaintance with Gosse's field
is not quite what it ought to be, but after that, we can
but share his feelings, when he points the finger of scorn
at the men who will try to write poetry, without an
eye to futurity like his and Dobson's :—
"Now every worldling flings his cap in rhyme,"
is a lofty line indeed, and only Poet Gosse could have
risked it. All worldlings wear caps; they all throw
them about; and all the caps are made of rhymes.
If Poet Gosse's monument is not more durable than
brass, his brass should, at least, last longer than many
monuments. And Poet Punch, being of the Gods already,
now welcomes Poet Gosse and Poet Dobson in the name
of the generations that are to be, at Poet Gosse's own
valuation:—
Posterity hath choice of Hobson,
'Twixt Poet Gosse and Poet Dobson;
Because entirely at a loss,
■Which may be Dobson—and which Gosse.

LEGAL OPINIONS r. STREET'S
GHOST.
On Thursday, March 25, judgment in this
interesting case, so long pending, was deli-
vered in the Central Hall, and in the Queen's
Bench Division, as reported in the Times:—
"The Lord Chancellor (in the Central Hall)
said,—This Palace of Justice was the crowning
work of Mr. Street's life. I am quite sure of
this, that the more this building is studied, and the
longer the profession live in it, the more reason
they will see to be grateful to the architect who
designed it, and to he satisfied with the result of
his labours. I remember, on the day when the
Court* were opened, a gentleman, whom I now see
present, said that he was quite sure that every day
we lived in them we should discover some fresh
beauty in them. As far aa I am concerned, that
observation has been completely verified.
"Mr. Baron Huddleston (in the Queen's
Bench) said, with regard to the Boyal Courts of
Justice, that they seemed to have been designed
and constructed so as to combine every possible
inconvenience to every person connected with them.
When consulted as to the proposed new Courts at
Birmingham, he had said that, whatever was done,
he strongly advised them not to copy the Boyal
Courts of Justice of London."
The Lord Chief Chancellor Justice Punch
fully agrees with what has fallen from both
his learned brethren, and is glad, in the
interests of the Public, that the matter is
settled. Not that the Public matters much.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE GLENEMIES.
Me. Coghxan's play of Enemies has some fine dramatic situations,
some well-drawn oharaoters, but mostly stagey ones, and a plot,
which being composed of very familiar materials, could not possibly
be interesting were it not for the excellent acting of everyone in the
piece. There is not one part
weakly played. Nothing could
be better, for example, than
the small part of Mrs. Lawler,
landlady of the "Crown and
Sceptre," as rendered by Mrs.
Lowering, and nothing pret-
tier in look and manner—beg

Heely as a countryman, was
correct or not; but I cannot understand why a rough, hulking,
sturdy poacher, as he is, allows Captain Percival Glenn to rummage
his pockets out, take his rabbits, and rob him of his gun, without
any show of resistance. The Glenn f amily are a queer lot. and a more
dangerous part than that of Sir Manners Glenn, a doddery, selfish,
scientific old Foozle, who has been a gay dog in his day, and who is
now always wanting someone to come and look at " a fine specimen of
a Furniss —probably some collection from the Illustrated or Graphic
it is difficult to imagine; especially, when at the very end of the
ay this comic old fool has to go on his knees to the chief villain,
eter Darvel, and confess how, out of mere light-hearted cussedness,
he had wrecked Peter's happiness. At Buch a moment, when the piece
is within five minutes of .a satisfactory conclusion, to give a funny old
chap a pathetic bit, snivelling, and grovelling on his knees, is about
the most risky thing an Author can do; and for an Actor to pull such
a situation through safely is very clever, but, if he compels a burst
of applause, it is a positive triumph of Art. Mr. Everill triumphs.
The more I consider this play, the more extraordinary appears the
interest it undoubtedly excited; and the more am I led to admire
the acting. For instance. There is the conventional old money-
lending villain, like Ralph Nickleby, with an oath taken forty
years ago to rum all the dramatis persona, one after the other. Well,
this diabolical character, called Peter Darvel, is excellently well
played by Mr. Fernandez, whose make-up suggests a new type of
our old stagey villanous friend, while he throws into it just suffi-
cient melodramatic action of the old school, to remind us that, after
all, this is only play-actin' and not stern reality.
Mr. Coghlan, as his son Richard, shows us the modern, realistic,
quiet, gentlemanly style of melodrama; but when he is with Mr.
Fernandez he has to play up to the Old School, to cast off the lamb
and assume the lion, or else
he would be simply wiped
out as colourless. As it is
he Bhows himself a veritable
chip of the old block, and
father and son have an
excellent give - and - take
scene between them,—in
fact it is a very 'Darvel of
a scene, and brings down
the House.
But besides the conven-
tional old money-lending
Peter, and the doddering
old Foozle who has been a
gay dog, there is an idiot,
called Daft Willie, who
being unable either to speak
or hear, can do little else
but Bkip about, grin, look
Our Artist's idea of how Mr. Pateman should occasionally like Mr. J. L.
have appeared in the character of a Deaf l00LE gone distraught,
Mute, and how he ought to have been execute some pantomime,
spoken "un-toe " by Miss Kose-up Heely. make curious noises in his
throat, and finally strangle
Rose Heely, who lives with her father the poacher, and Daft Willie
(small and select society) in the Glen; and so may be called another
'Glen family." So that part of the action of the piece is divided


between the Glenn Family with very odd Manners, and the Glen
Family with Btill stranger manners. The remainder of the action
is DarveVs, which is a legal one to deprive Manners of his estates.
"Glen" enters so much into the piece that an advertisement of
"Glen Whiskey" appears in the programme of the Prince's theatre,
and is probably the drink patronised t>y the Glen family when out on
the Moors.
Then there is Lord Dunderby, anTaristocratic old idiot, not deaf
or dumb, but also given to making curious
noises, and to skipping when he gets an oppor-
tunity. This character-part could not be better
made-up, or played, than it is by Mr. H.
Kemble; the lines he has to say are not ex-
ceptionally brilliant, but they are characteristic,
and he makes every one of them tell.
Mr. Grahame gives an admirable reading of
that superior specimen of an aristocratic cad,
Captain Glenn. The Author didn't trouble
his head about him, after he had served his
Eurpose; and so Captain Percival Glenn, who
ad come in like a lion, goes out like a lamb.
But with the character of Margaret Glenn
the Author has taken great pains, and while he
is to be complimented on the skill with which
he has fitted the Actress, the latter deserves all
praise for, as it seems to me, her true rendering 'v
of the Author's meaning. Margaret is a hand-'
some, high-spirited young lady in whom the Mr. Kemble, who only

vide the materials for the vices of pride, selfish- MunderM in one
ness, and obstinacy, being directed towards a scene. This was the
worthy object, become the virtues of proper self- sort of inspiration in
respect, sympathy, and determination; and tne Author's mind:
these, combined with a certain shrewdness in 'Coghlan put the Kem-
business matters, and considerable address, make ble on,
her altogether a very exceptional character. Coghlan take him off
There are situations as, for example, when she "ga'n-
strikes the conventional old villain, where I should like to see her
"let herself go" with greater abandon than she does. Here and
there I notice this restraint, and I ask myself, can it be at all due to
the Author, who. as Commander-in-Chief of the " Reserve Forces,"
has told his pupil to keep herself well under control? On the other
hand, nothing could be more in keeping with the character than her
interview with Richard Darvel in the Fourth Act, and if she tones
down the exit to the colour of the rest of the scene, none but the
hypercritical could find fault with her performance in this situation.
In the last Act everything is over and the Author is evidently shut-
ting up the shop, and going home as fast as he can. There is not
much for anyone to do, except the old Foozle, who is one minute on
his knees confessing his early wickedness,—all the Glenns are of a
dogged character, and the old man was of a gay-dogged character—
and the next, he
is chuckling over

If Mr. Kemble will'take my advice, he will come to terms with
Mr. Coghlan, and develop the character of his Lordship into a sort
of Dundreary, and, after a little reconstruction, bring out the piece
in America,—where they love to see an English Lord chaffed,—and,
after a successful run there, reproduce it here, with himself as the
star, calling it no longer Enemies, but Lord Dunderby. Success to
Mr. Kemble in this venture is the wish of his sincere admirer,
Nibbs.

in London, and £rard and Bkoadwood say it ought to be a good piano-
forte year now he has returned.
A NAUGHTY NOVELISTS DIARY;
Or, How "As in a Looking Glass " was Probably Written.
January.—Began the year with a capital notion, suggested by
reading A Bad Boy's Diary. Why not a Bad Girl's? Only
serious, of course—in three volumes—not comic, and "published at a
Bhilling—selling at ninepence." Bad Girl must be a woman of the
world, fast, lots of French slang, with a touch of pathos. Makes
her Diary a Father Confessor—tells it everything. Leaves it in the
last chapter, to be read by somebody or other, to explain—every-
thing. Of course carries it about everywhere. A pretty consider-
able MS., by the way, for a woman of the world to be bothered with.
Must make Bad Girl a little eccentric, as I have got a lot of Shak-
spearian quotations I want to work in somewhere. Oh, I know.
Parson's daughter. That will account for everything. Wicked
now, but early training exoellent. Bead nothing but the Bible and
Shakspeare, and, altogether most proper and good. Write to my
Publishers, and see what they say about it.
February.—Publishers like the idea, but prefer one volume to
three. Greater demand among the public for the former than the
latter, and more convenient shape when it gets to the popular
"ShiUing-selling-for-ninepence" stage of its existence. Well, I
will see now I get on. Always send my copy in by instalments.
First about title. Fond of Shaxspeare, Holding up the Mirror.
Done by somebody else. As in a Glass—not bad, but open to chaff.
Critics might want to know'' what particular spirit was in the glass?"
Through the Looking Glass. I have it! As in a Looking Glass.
Excellent! New and appetising. Send the idea to my Publishers.
March.—Publishers say all right about title—might perhaps
suggest a quaint sort of binding. Toilette-table, with a face look-
ing from the glass." Yes, perhaps. But that's their business, not
mine. And now about names generally, at which I am not good.
Thought of calling my heroine Fatima at first, but changed it to
Lena. Rather fancy I have heard the name somewhere in real life.
Possibly another "Clergyman's daughter, who forgot her early
training." If so, give people something to talk about. Lena
Despard. Despard sort ot suggestion of "Desperate." Little too
much like the characters in the Pantomimes. "Cricketers, Messrs.
Wicketts, Stumps, Batts, Gloves, and Ball," but will do. Begun
capitally. Bad Girl Lena lets the public into her.secret. She has a
past, but has taken for a motto, "Let bygones be bygones." Past
consists of relations of a dubious character, or rather not of a
dubious character, with Jack Fontinbras (not a very good name—
Sicked it out of Hamlet—always was fond of Shakspeaee), a
ivorce suit or two, and anything else of a compromising nature I
like to throw in as I go on. Of course must read up "Lady
novelists," to get style of women. Bbaddon—no, not even for
French. Ooida—no, not a bit like it. Rhoda Bboughton—that's
it. Capital! Quite her line of country—only a little developed.
Think I have got my heroine about right by this time Lena—
Becky Sharp, modernised, with a refined and "high-toned" (as the
Yankees would say) dash of the garrison hack—I forget her name—
in Nancy. Careful to put in a lot about dress—ladies always do.
Might possibly get an American to help me. Also speak somewhere
of a "foaming glass of Soda and B. Female touch that. Now,
having settled character finally, go on with the story. Mustn't tell
all at once. Allusion in the Diary will work in anything useful to the
development of the plot. Send opening chapters to my Publishers.
April.—Publishers delighted, only one of them (they both say it's
the other) wants to know.whether she is to be wicked to the very
end?" Of course not. Sat down and knocked off last chapter
leaving name in blank for virtuous chap she has married (because
Bhe shall marry a virtuous chap), and making her die by taking an
overdose, suicidally administered, of chloral. Very much affected.
Cried over it. Sent it off to Publishers, asking them what they
thought of that f
May.—Publishers delighted with last chapter. Both cried over it.
Want to know how I am getting on. Return, first-rate. Just started
a Russian into the story. In fact, two. Head of Seoret Police (this
kind of character introduced and made popular by Sabdou, in Dora,
Ffdora, &c.) and conventional Prince. Call the Head of Police (who
should be immense when developed) Domiioff. Not very good name,
but for the life of me can't get a better. "Off," of course, all right,
in fact absolutely essential, as the chap is a Russian (what Russian
ever had a name that did not end with "off ? "), but don't much care
for the " Domit " which, I candidly admit, is Somersetshire swearing.
However, I will jot it down and alter it in proof. But having got
these first-rate characters on paper, must get them in the flesh,
especially as my Chief of Police, in appearance is, with his "hooked
nose almost meeting his chin, rather too much like Mr. Punch.
Dropped a line to Publishers to say, mustn't expect to hear from me
for a fortnight or so, as I was off to study character.
June.—At Monte Carlo studying character. Rather late, but still
amusing. Trying (" all for the sake of Lena ") a little system I have
fot—put a napoleon on 18, 20, 22, and 24, and double the stake on
air—and see what comes of it. Send a post-card to Publishers
telling them how hard at work I am.
July.—Left Monte Carlo because it was empty. System also a
little disappointing. Studying character this month at Ostend.
Bathing excellent. Publishers write to say "Glad I am enjoying
myself, but when are they to have any more copy?" Reply, " After I
have studied a little more character, and as to enjoying myself, I
am hard at work."
August.—Still at Ostend: lots of character. Making notes of it.
Write to Publishers and tell them how well I am getting on.
September.—Publishers again making inquiries about copy. Write
back, "Must attend shooting-party in the sake of Art. Probably
may introduce some sporting sketches in As In a Looking Glass.
Consequently must knock over a few partridges."
October.—Got back to work—I mean, finished studying character.
Overhauled my novel. First-rate—like it very much. Plenty of
subject for six volumes, much less three. Russian Chief capital.
Get 'em all in his meshes. Lena to become " moucharde" like Marie
de Fontanges in Plot and Passion. Communicated with Publishers.
November.—Publishers say " They are glad I have begun again,
and hope I enjoyed my long holiday." "Long holiday!" What
nonsense! But these people never know what they mean. Send in a
heap of matter.
December.—Important interview with Publishers. They said,
"they had enough for a volume, and wouldn't I have it published in
that form, for which there undoubtedly was a demand, and which
had several advantages when they come to the shilling-edition-sold
at-ninepence form." They added, "that the last chapter, which I
sent in some time since, (and at which they both had cried) would,
in their opinion, do admirably for a. finale to what had already been
set up, that was, if I didn't mind." Urged that last chapter would
come too suddenly, and what was I to do with my Russian episode.
Answer by telegraph, "Last chapter could not be too sudden—too
admirable for that, and Russian episode would keep for something
else." Consented. Ended the year by hearing that As In a Looking
Glass was a genuine success, and likely to be good for several
editions. As for the Muscovites, they are off for the present. Quite so.
butwhaf'off?" Oh, bother! Can only think of "leave off." I will!

THE QUEEN INAUGURATING THE SAVOY SAWBONES HALL.
From the Drawing of th-at rare old Master Medical Hallbein, in Mr. Punch's jwsscssion. Hall Portraits.
MOUNTED LONDON.
The advantages of Battersea Park for Equestrians are obvious :—
First.—One of the main approaches is by the Chelsea Embank-
ment, where may be heard and seen, at most hours of the day,
machinery of various sorts in motion, in which it is probable your
horse will take a lively interest.
Secondly.—The frequent arrivals and departures of the penny
boats from the different piers keep the eyes and ears of the Eques-
trian, not to mention his hands and legs, well occupied. For
distraction there is no exercise like riding; and especially along the
Chelsea part of the Embankment, which is much affected by drays,
vans, waggons, going along at a good swingeing pace, witn such a
clanking and grinding noise, that anyone asleep within a hundred
yards of them would be awoke with a shock that would render them
sleepless for nights afterwards. As a rule it is only the driver who
seems to be utterly indifferent to the noise. If calm repose in the
midst of disturbance is any evidence of a good conscience, then
most of these drivers of vans, waggons, drays, and suchlike monster
vehicles, must be the most paradisiacal innocents that ever breathed
heavily.
Thirdly.—At certain hours the children from schools in the vicinity
make things uncommonly lively for the Equestrian.
Fourthly.—So do the wharf-labourers about dinner-time.
Fifthly.—Crossing the Suspension Bridge. This must be for
Equestrians the first step toward teaching an animal to compete with
the Blondin Horse, in its marvellous feat of traversing the plank.
Gently does it. The trick is only taught by kindness in the shape
of sugar. N.B.—Take lots of sugar out riding with you in your
Sockets. Thus provided, you may attempt the Suspension Bridge on
orseback.
Sixthly.—Your animal, if of an inquiring turn of mind, will
examine—nay, it may even stop to examine—everything right and left
with the utmost anxiety. The horse is a more or less intelligent
animal, and very nervous about anything he can't quite understand.
He can't understand most things. To impart this intelligence is an
affair of time, kindness (sugar as before), and perseverance. A
cross word and no cross bridge. So far the Equestrian en route for
Battersea Park will find his time fully occupied.
Seventhly.—Supposing the Equestrian safely across the bridge,
and comfortably clear of the 'busses which have a halting place on
the Surrey-side, he will gratefully turn at once into the Park. Here
he has the choice of two sides of the soft ride: ono by the river,
which offers, as its main attractions, the proximity of the steamers,
the landing-stage, the barges and the boats: and the other to the
left, presents an undulating surface between two banks, on the
higher of which foot passengers can appear at various points with a
startling suddenness that would do credit to a Zulu warrior in savage
warfare, and where on both sides, close to the railings, the youths of
Battersea, encouraged by considerable experience of the utter un-
likelihood of any official interference with their amusements, play
purposeless games, quarrel and fight, and only unite on the appear-
ance of a mounted stranger, when they will rush into the ride, yell
and shout, and then back themselves for Nursery-stakes along the
side-path against the horse.
The Park is overlooked by a whole system of railways. Trains are
running in various directions every five minutes, and if there should
be a lull of more than this, a locomotive is sent swiftly along the line
to inquire what is the matter. So that the Equestrian can never
be dull: there is always something to enliven him, and to engage
his horse's attention. During the summer there is also cricket, and
there are other games of a more or less quiet character. The return
journey from Battersea Park, by a line of quiet streets, offers the
varied attractions of organs, German bands, barrows, handtrucks,
and bakers' carts until the main thoroughfare is reached, when, in
all probability, the Equestrian will find the.roadway taken up, and
a traction-engine in f lill operation.
Hyde Park, it is true, does not possess all these charms for the
Equestrian, having simply one monotonous ride, Rotten Row, instead
of some twenty bridle-paths, each capable of accommodating four
abreast, traversing, the Park, North, South, East, and. West, with
intersecting rides across Kensington Gardens under the trees.
To this subject Mr. Punch will return, and in the meantime he
thanks Sir Morning Post for seconding his motion with regard to
Metropolitan improvements.
"EHEU, FUGACES!'
"Unfortunately the more or less fugitive colours are not only far the most
numerous, but they are also the most brilliant and useful to the artist."—
Mr. J. C. Robinson's Letter to " The Times."
True, Sir! Our Tueneb takes a leading part
In the triumphal march of English Art,
But 'tis the source of unavailing dolours
That it so oft should be with flying colours.'
AS COLD AS CHARITY."
One begins to understand the old phrase when one reads, in the
Report of the Proceedings of the last Meeting of the Kensington
Board of Guardians, of the aged paupers in the old women's ward of
that Workhouse sitting shivering, with open windows, at a tempera-
ture of 43°, during the late severe weather. It is stated that
"the atmosphere was severe, and the coughing of those who had
bronchial affections was something distressing. We should think
so. At least, to anyone not "porochially " pachydermatous. Poor
old souls! One shivers, in sympathy, at the bare thought of them.
What can be much crueller than to deprive blood-chiUed old age of
the only thing that makes the life of aged poverty endurable, a
due measure of warmth? The picture of those bronchial old Biddys
in that cold, comfortless ward, suggests some of the icy scenes in
Dante's Inferno. What were they being punished for? Could
anything less heinous than helpless poverty deserve such dreadful
treatment? And yet there are some obstinate ancients of the Bettx
Hioden sort who shrink from the tender mercies of the Union!
Somebody—besides the old women—ought to be "warmed up" for
this.
"Anchored" is advertised as " the most popular song of the day."
Then it ought to be further announced as "Ancored, daily."

Grosvenor, than the pseudo-mediffival-O-quite-too-beautiful-namby-pamby-gilt-
edged-and-gothie-elasped-Charoh-seryice style of the effeminate religious Art of
Mr. Holm an Hunt. Millais tried it, ana, after a struggle, snapped the pre-
Raphaelite fetters, and escaped.
No. 4. " The Awakened Conscience," has been lent by Sir Thomas FAiRBArRN.
How everyone must envy the happy possessor of such a gem! It is so precious
that, were it ours, we would hang it up in a cupboard at the top of the house.
At night perhaps it might be kept in the hall, to frighten possible burglars.
No. 6. Look at Claudio's hair. _ Isabella is telhnghim he really must have
it cut. Some people admire this picture immensely. Happy people!
No. 7. "The Hireling Shepherd." Everything in this picture charming
except the rural Stigqins and the hoyden. Mr. Holman Hunt," says the
Catalogue, "painted this picture in rebuke of the sectarian vanities ana vital
negligences of the nation. Did he P And how the nation has improved in con-
sequence !" The sheep are jumping a rivulet into the cornfield. "What is the
moral of the fable? Does it mean Protection, or Fair Trade, or Free Trade, or
is it prophetic, and is the Hireling Shepherd Mr. Gladstone, and the girl Hi her-
nia, while the Liberal Flock are distributing themselves in different directions?
The two celebrated pictures No. 12 and No. 26 we cannot away with,—which
is lucky for the Exhibition, as they are of course the great attractions. How
some former admirers must be disillusioned now 1 Ah, bah! Let us turn the
corner, and see the Sketches of London by Mr. Herbert MAmnTAT.T^ R.W.S.
Let a perfect stranger to our Metropolis take Mr. Marshall's views of Bird-
cage Walk, and Park Lane, and he would say, "It's all very well to talk to me
of Spain and Italy for atmosphere and colour, but give me London."
What delicious, bat misleading, names London possesses! Imagine anything
sweeter than "Lavender Wharf." Yet we should imagine that a visit would
soon undeceive the too confiding nose. "The Hay Market" has a sweet rural
sniff about it. "Cherry Garden Pier," " The Sanctuary," "St. Martin's-in-
the-Fields," all on view in Mr. Marshall's Exhibition, and a welcome relief after
half-an-hour with Holman Hunt.
TO MY PICTURE.!
"Further, I say, that "every fully-coloured water-colour
drawing, framed ana exposed to the light, begins to change and
fade, to die, in fact, from the very moment that it is so exposed;
that the only remedy is either to keep such drawings in the dark
in portfolios, to exhibit them only by artificial light in the even-
ings, or else, in private houses, to keep them covered with cur-
tains of some thick opaque material when they are not actually
being examined."—Extract from Mr. J. C. Robinson's Letter
to the " Timet:'
The Water-Colour Purchaser sings—
0 Picture, purchased for my delectation,
Must all thy beauty last but for a day,
And, by some process of evaporation,
E'en, as I gaze upon thee, pass away?
Will all thy landscape fade? Thy azure mountains
Into a leaden gray tone gently down?
Thy clouds grow red; the water of thy fountains,
From heaven's own hue, develop into brown?
Will this sad thought to me come glibly home:
"'Twere better had you been but monochrome!"?
Or shall I, wary in my generation,
Thy colour-charms endeavour to retain,
And quietly suffer thee, with resignation,
Within my darkened cellar to remain P
And shall I there, when friends are with me dining,
Beneath with them to that same cellar steal,
And by a dim dark lantern's dusky shining,
Thy points of beauty manage to reveal?
And shall we, as we mount that cellar-flight,
Admit the game is really worth the light r
Or shall I from thy gilded frame remove thee,
And keep thee in some snug portfolio laid,
And have thee out that critics may approve thee,
Discreetly viewed in dim judioious shade?
Or see thee, curtained off, revealed obscurely
To connoisseurs who look in one by one,
In chamber darkened, and out off securely
From any random entrance of the sun P
Shall I, in short, on thee set such a store,
That thou become' st a great artistic bore!
No, no! I '11 face the worst! Nor shade nor curtain
Shall veil thee. What, if Robinson appals
With tale of colour fickle and uncertain,
Thine, while it lasts, shall deck my chamber walls.
Shift blue to gray, thy red tints disappearing,
Come what change will,—to me thou'rt still the
same,
Buoyed up at least by this thought, bright and
cheering,
That I, unchanged, shall yet possess thy frame.
So, picture, know, that bought for my delight,
Perish in it or not, thou 'It see the light.

THE FRENCH GALLERY.
As people of all countries meet in Paris, so do Painters
of a variety of nationalities assemble at the French Gallery
in Pail-Mall. Mr. Punch had the honour of being intro-
duced the other afternoon to MM. Meissonter, Frees,
Kaulbach, Heffner, Gerome, Corot, Israels, Seller,
LOEFFTZ, HOLMBERO, VONPOSCHINGER, RaSCH,DARGELAS,
Bokelmann, and other distinguished. Artists, at Mr.
Wallis's most pleasant salon. This Gallery has the
advantage of not being too large, and its walls are not too
crowded. You can see the pictures without breaking your
neck, or bringing on a determination of blood to the head.
For these considerations Mr. P. is truly grateful, as it
enables him thoroughly to appreciate a good Art-show,
without subsequently suffering from the Exhibition
Headache.
A Pretty Girl's Ultimatum.
[The Rational Dress Reformers, in their attacks upon tight-
lacing, make a great point of the fact that the waist of the Yenua
de' Medici is twenty-six inches in circumference.]
Twenty-Six inches P What a taste!
But Statues form no precedent.
The argument from such a waist
Is simply waste of argument.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 22.—New Members had new
treat to-night. Often heard of Gladstone blazing forth in sudden
wrath at unexpected times. Saw him at it to-night. Came out on
Motion by Howard Vincent, to increase Capitation Grant to Volun-
teers. One or two Members had spoken whilst Premier sat restless
on Treasury Bench. Then he jumped up, and the astonished House
found him in towering passion. In-
crease of Capitation Grant meant
increased taxation, "and," he con-
tinued, glaring fixedly upon Grand
Cross, who happened to be within the
focus of his eye, "all I can say is
that the House may find a Minister
who will carry out their orders for an
increase of the taxation of the country,
but the Minister will not be the one
who is now addressing them."
A reference, familiar enough to Old
Members, to his stay in the House
being limited to "days or months," so
excited Mr. Leicester, that he hur-
riedly rose, and rushed off to Tele-
graph Office. "He's going to resign,"
he said, "and my constituents snail
be the first to know it."
When he came back, Gladstone
still thundering away, cheers and
counter-cheers filling the astonished
House. Harcourt presenting him-
self in new character of mediator, so
astonished House that it partly cooled
down. Excitement increased again
as Division drew near. Rumours
that the Government would be beaten.
And so they would have been, but
that at the last moment Colonel Joseph
Gilles, rallying the Irish Brigade,
led them to relief of beleaguered Ministry, and turned the fortunes
of the day by a majority of 21. Resolution rejected.
Business done.—Some Votes in Army Estimates.
Tuesday.—Tone of House distinctly raised to-day. Christopher
Sixes took oath and seat, and New Members will have a model

Joieph Leicester, M.P.
which it is to be hoped they will sedulously observe. Christopher
(rot through the ceremony of introduction with that simple grace and
dignity that distinguishes his every movement. Evidently fearful
that Sir Thomas Mat wanted to shake hands with him. He steadily
stared at him for space of moment, nipping in the bud any such
inconvenient intention. Having signed the book, he stood at full
arm's-length of the Speaker, regarding the Right Hon. Gentleman
with curious stare, as if he were going round a Museum, and had
now come to its most remarkable specimen. Speaker held out his
hand. Christopher stared at it with slightly accelerated interest,
touched it with the tips of his
fingers, and then fared forth
behind the Chair, not to be seen
again to-night. Sufficient for one
day was the introduction thereof.
New Members watched scene with
prof oundest interest, nudging each
other, and telling now this was
the man who passed the Crab and
Lobster Bill, and often had the
Prince of Wales to dinner.
Christopher, still suffering
from accident, slightly limped in
his passage up the House. Pretty
to see Arch, a little later, leaving
the House, affecting limp. Ex-
pect it will be rather the thing
this Session. Shall have all the
New Members limping about the
premises. That is a trick easily-
caught; but Christopher is safe
in the sole possession of the sub-
limity of his who-the-doose-are-
you? stare. No one can imitate
that.
A steady night's debate on
Local Taxation. Level course
interrupted by speech from Am-
brose, in which he referred to
his " experience of some hun-
dreds of years." House roared with incredulous laughter. But,
to me, very interesting incident. Began to believe shall never really
fathom the peculiarities of the New Members.
Business done.—THonoLD Rogers's Resolution on Local Taxation
carried by 216 votes against 176.
Wednesday.—Joseph Gnxis is an altered man. Still lingers
around old familiar scene, but 'tis the ghost of his former self. Sits

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAEL

Joseph Arch, M.P.
out of sight, under shadow of Gallery. His shrill "Hear, hear!"
no longer hreaks in upon dehate. He never now puts questions
designed to connect Lord Lieutenant with irregularities at the Bally-
mahoolly Post Office, or with shortcomings alleged against the matron
of the McKillykollie Work-
house. His eyes have lost
their lustre, his smile full
two inches of its breadth.
"Isn't my Joseph well?"
I asked him to-day, for we
always have been on affec-
tionate terms.
"Well enough in body,
Toby," he said, wearily;
"but sick in the sowl. If
they call this being in Par-
liament, they may nave it all
to themselves. You mind
you of the times when we
used to move the Adjourn-
ment at Question Time, and
howl at the Chief Secretary?
How we used to keep talking,
on going into Committee, till morning
broke; how I used to cry "Hear,
hear!" when Gladstone spoke of
nearness of his death, how we used
to defy the Speaker, bully the Chair-
man, and generally go agin tho
Government? All this over now.
No questions worth putting. Cheer
the Chief Secretary instead of howl-
ing at him. Behave respectfully to
Gladstone, bow to the Speaker, let
Courtney live peacefully, and, worse
than all,—vote with the Government. That's what breaks my heart,
Toby. Could stand some of the other things; but to rush in, as we did
on Monday night, and save the Government from being defeated, is
more'n I can stand, though being in for it I lead the reserve column.
I've begged Parnell to give us at least one night, but he won't.
'Wait, says he,' till we've got what we want, and then you can
make up for lost time.' That's all very well, but I fear I won't live
to see it. I'm sinking, Toby, sinking fast. Some day they '11 come
and fetch me to vote in a Division with the Government, and they '11
find me dead."
A tear coursed slowly down Joseph's comely cheek; his voice
broken by a sob. I myself, strangely touched. Silently wrung his
hand, and we parted.
Business done.—Cornwall Sunday Closing Bill carried by large
majority.
Thursday.—Committee did not seem particularly anxious to hear
Goldswoetht to-night, Drawing towards midnight, and, for six
hours, speeches going forward on miscellaneous subjects connected
with Army. Two hours ago got into Egypt, and talked about
withdrawal of troops—not, in itself, absolutely new. So, when the
General presented himself, uttered a peremptory "Hem!" squared
his shoulders, and looked good for forty minutes, he was met with a
yell that would have frightened an ordinary man. But General has
smelt powder in India and Abyssinia. He is now in the habit of
dealing at the Army and Navy Stores, though, as he said when
charged with this offence, he "also deals with thirty-three other
tradesmen." Not the man to be put down by clamour in the House
of Commons. If Committee wanted^ to shout, let them shout. He
would wait. Brodrick, touched by his situation, came to his assist-
ance. Wanted to have Bradlaugh named for snouting "Divide!"
Brodrick's interruption signal for renewed tumult. Brodrick
himself nut down by Chairman, the General once more rose, standing
dumbly in the breach, whilst the roar of "Divide 1" rose and fell
around him. But he had something to say, and would say it, in
spite of Radical rowdyism. In partial lull in uproar he was heard
to shout,—
"Some time ago I was in on omnibus"
Why Committee should roar with laughter at this General didn't
know. But he had interested them, and amid comparative quiet
went on to describe how soldier presented himself, and proposed to
seat himself inside omnibus. "You must go on the top, said Con-
ductor. "Why must he go on the top, General Goldsworthy
asked, "as an officer." "Beoause," said the Conductor HereChair-
man interposed. Pointed out that tho conduct of tho omnibus Con-
ductor was not before the Committee. Question was that sum of
£866,500 be granted to Her Majesty to meet the charges for clothing
establishments.' Thus encouraged by Authority, Committee again set
upon gallant General, who, after vainly struggling, sucoumbed, and
left untold what the Conductor said.
Business done.—Army Estimates.
Friday Night.—Gladstone back to-night after! day's absence,
through illness. Liberals took opportunity of giving him rattling
cheer. Hicks-Beach took opportunity to question him about pro-
cedure on Irish policy. Could he tell the House in what form the
statement would be made? "Most certainly," said Gladstone, in
the eagerness of the moment slightly misquoting. If there was any-
thing in the world that could give "him pleasure, it would be to tell
the House everything he knew about proposed Bills. House settled
itself eagerly to listen, but didn't get very much. Premier's eager-
ness to be communicative began and ended with emphatic "Most
certainly." All else he could add was, that on the 8th April he
would make a statement, which was what Harcourt had assured
the House last night. Still the Premier's manner was so frank,
his readiness to reply so emphatic, that House felt satisfied, and did
not discover for five minutes, when opportunity of prolonging
inquisition was gone, that the Grand Old Mystifier had told them
nothing more than they already knew.
House proceeded to discuss Greenwich Hospital Funds. Droned
along till Eight o'clock. Joseph Gillis, walking about in the rest-
less manner that has come over him of late, looked in now and then,
but always tore himself away. Had promised to behave himself,
and would try. Eight o'clock. Thirteen Members present, each
with speech ready. Knew there were not twenty more on the
premises. Joseth looked on with wistful, hungry eyes. It would
not matter once—just once—and those thirteen fellows would be so
mad. In hollow voice, scarcely recognised, he moved a Count. Not
forty Members answered the summons, and, for the first time in its
history, the Parliament of 1886 was Counted Out. As for Joey B.,
he hailed a homeward-bound bus with lighter heart. It was not
much. But it was something.
Business done.—House Counted Out.
ANOTHER WILD SUGGESTION.
J?
The Commissioners of Sewers, determined, apparently, not to be
outdone in absurdity by the Court of Common Council, discussed
and actually carried a Resolution at their last Meeting, instructing
their Streets Committee, who are about advertising for Tenders for
paving some of the City streets with Asphalte, to inquire why
English Labourers cannot be employed rather than Italians, who are
usually engaged upon this rather delicate and somewhat difficult
operation. The number thus employed in the City is so small,
that the resolution was probably intended as a sarcasm upon the
attempt previously made to induce the Corporation to resolve that
none but British iron should be used in the construction of the
Tower Bridge. But the Commissioners, taking the ironical resolu-
tion au sirieux, actually passed it, despite the threatened addition,
by a witty Commissioner, that none but English Grinders be allowed
to torture the Public by playing Italian organs!
As a proof of how contagious is the enunciation of a bad principle,
we may allude to the fact that, within a few days of the notice of
Motion being given in the Court of Common Council as to the use
of none but British iron in the Tower Bridge, the Municipality of
Paris brought up their Budget, including the expenditure of twenty-
five millions of francs on improvements in their beautiful oity; and
this was agreed to, but with this novel addition, that all the various
materials used, and all the labour employed, should be solely and
exclusively French!
Snap!
The latest amusement of the pooh-pooh school of paragraph
writers is to sneer at M. Pasteur and his efforts to safeguard
humanity against a horrible disease. Perhaps the graphic gentle-
men a little overdo the dreadful details in their daily reports of the
progress of M. Pasteur's patients. But that iB not M. Pasteur's
fault, and all sensible and kindly people must wish him success in
his enterprise. Perhaps the snapping cynics, who are a little apt to
run rabid themselves sometimes, sympathise more with the dogs and
the disease than with the doctor. A fellow feeling makes them
wondrous—savage.
A New Danoer.—To the Editor.—Sir, I read the other day in
the Daily News of a proposed " Irish Exodus." When I first heard
of the Revised Version I dreaded something of this sort. What
next? Is there to be an Irish Genesis, a Scotch Deuteronomy, a
Welsh Leviticus? When will it stop ?—I remain, indignantly,

of this?

A Brilliant Variation.—Mr. and Mrs. Littleton's
reception of the Abbe Franz Liszt, at Westwood House,
Saturday night last, was an event never to be forgotten.
But it was not until all the Great 'uns had left the
Littletons that the Greatest of them all sat at the piano
in the midst of a cosy and select circle, and then, when
Mr. P-nch had put on his Liszt Blippers but to
say more were a Dreach of hospitality. Suffice it that on
taking up his sharp-and-flat candlestick in a perfectly
natural manner the Abbe, embracing Mr. P—ch, sobbed
out, "This is the Abbe'ist evening I've ever had! Au
plaisir!''—(Extract from a Distinguished Guest's Diary.
Privately communicated).
It is not much of a compliment to a Cricketer to call
him "An out-and-out player."
A STRIKING CONTRAST.
I'm quite free to confess as how we've bin rayther short of Princes
and Dooks at the Manshun House lately, and all kinds of warious
reesons has been given to acount for it. They 're none on 'em quite
satisfactory to me, no hexcuses never ain't, for I quite agrees with
the great Dook of Cambridge wen he sed, as the feller as is good at
hexcuses ain't never not no good at anythink else. However we broke
the hice last Satterday week and had a Royal Prince and a Royal
Dook all in one, and wno is also the Commander in Chief of all the
Middysterraynean Sea, and the Marster of the Trinity House on Tower
111. I confesses as this larst title seems rayther a tumble down arter
the others, but as the pashent Hangler hobserves, "Little Fishes is
sweet."
The kind Lord Mare, ankshus no dowt to give the poor old fellers
a treat, arsked all the Elder Brothers of the Trinity House to cum
and see their royal Marster, witch they all did, and drest theirselves
up in blue and gold liwerys, jest like reel Sailers, tho' why their
poor yunger brothers was left out in the cold noboddy coudn't tell
me.
To perwent anythink like jealousy, I spose, on the part of the Army,
we had also another Royal Prince and Royal Dook all in one, and who
is also the Commander in Chief of all the Queen's Armys, and jest to
oblige his Newy, I spose, he acshally cum drest like a Sailer, all in
blew. So wen he rose up to return thanks for the Army, he amost
blusht, and apollygised for his blew costoom, witoh he oped as the
Army wood xouse, Dut many of the werry old Ginerals looked werry
sawage at the slite on their royal Skarlet, and so did the four royal
skarlet Footmen as stood behind the Royal Princes oheers.
It was a purf ectly lovely Bite wen the eompenny all stood up to
drink "the Queen, for with the xception of just a few Common
Couoilmen in sollem black, jest to give a tone to the pieter and carst
a hair of respecterbility over the hole lot, they was all in ether skarlet
or blew unyform, ana all smothered over wifh sitch lots of gold
lookets and dimond stars, as I spose, their warious wives lent'em jest

contrast! Why I've aoshally seed the present Prime Minister, pore
fellah, a setting next to the Lord Mare on one of these brillyant
ocashuns, and he was drest as plane as a Metherdist Parson, and
hadn't ewen got no Star! Brown sed as the reason was, as he hadn't
got no Garter, but I should like to know how Brown could know that,
he hasn't never bin his Wally I suppose.
Lord Gran will made the oeBtjoke of the heavening. He sed as
he was a Brother of the Trinity House, and he claimed for his Elder
Brothers as they put up the most usefoolest Lites round the Coast,
and made the most hidjus noises with their fog-signels, of any
Brothers old or yung, anywheres. That a frend of nis was woke in
the nite and thort it must be a dying Cow in the back garding, and
went down to sea, but coudn't find it, so Lord Granwtll, seeing Sir
Arther Sully wan at the table, said as he had no dowt at all but
that it was " The Lost Cord," which had been found at last by his
Elderly Bretheren, wen everybody else had given it up!
Well, arter waiting on Royal Prinoes and Dooks.praps one can
ardly think of a grater change than offishiating at a Bank wet of the
Washupfool Company of Barbers! I natrally had sum esitation in
accepting the ingagement, but curiosity overoum pride, and I went,
and suttenly a more respectabel looking lot of Air Dressers I shood
think was never seed. I did not reckognise my own partickler
hartist from the 7 Dials among 'em. Praps they draws the line at
'' Clean shave Id." My nite was a nite of wunders! Fust there was
the Dining-room, built by Inkynose Jones, as Brown told me, and
he seems to know amost everythink, and then there was the picters,
such picters! Why 1 was told as the werry biggest of the hole lot,
whioh was painted ever so long ago by Old Bine, is of such enormous

three thowsand pounds for a little bit of it, becoz it was a little bit
like his Grandfather, but the Barbers, like true artists as they is,
declined with thanks.
Then there was the Plate! amost all of it given by Kings and
Queens. Wot a story sum of it tells of the days of old, ah, and of
the nites too. Fansy a punch Bole given'em by Queen Ann, all of
sollid silver, and big enuff for a Bath for a Baby, and so hewy that
I coud scarcely lift it. And then there's a lovely Gold square Cup
that holds about a pint, with four bells hanging at the four corners,
and at a certain time of the Bankwet every gest had to fill it with his
favrite drink and empty it at a draft, and then soberly ring the four
bells, and this was guv 'em by that reel lover of wedded life, Enery

There was a Major Joseph Sumbody, I didn't quite ketch his other
name, and in course I shoodn't have named it if I had done so, who
must have got just sitch a seller of Port Wine as I shood like to have.
I herd him tell his estonished naybur, a old Common Couselman as I
has known a werry long time, that the werry yungest Port in his
seller was '47! The only remark as his nayber made was. Ar! but
there was a twinkle in his grey eye that was equal to a hole wollum

and guv out his Toasts like flashes of Hartillery, and without won
shuperflous word. And wot with the hinteresting All, and the old
picters, and the old Plate, and the old Wine, it was one of the nicest

manly looking Barbers and their gests seemed to think. Bjmert.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MR. PUNCH EXPERIENCED NO UNPLEASANTNESS FROM
THE CROWD AT THE BOAT-RACE THIS YEAR.
GRAND ROUNDS."
Sir,—You asked me, as General Inspector of Artistic Forces, to
go round to the different Studios on Little Show Sunday, and on the
Great Show Sunday—which, alas, is sometimes pas grand1 shows—to
which request I respectfully but firmly declined to accede. I am all
for the Sunday opening of places of recreation to the Public—
have I not seen the Salon in Paris opened gratis to the working-man
and provincials, and crowded on a Sunday morning ?—with respect-
able refreshments within reach—for nothing so stimulates the
appetite and drinketite as sight-seeing. But this Sunday opening is
for those who cannot get any other day in the week, not for those
who can; and therefore, Sir, I would not, on compulsion, visit any
Studios on the Sundays named by you. My inspection combines
business with pleasure; but on Sunday I want no business, com-
bined or otherwise. No, Sir, on the Day of Rest, as, with becoming
dignity, I informed you, I like to take things easily: whereupon
you frivolously returned, "Why not take things easel-ly, and see
the Studios?" Ah, 8ir, cannot you be serious even on such a
subject? Must, forsooth, Sunday become for you merely Punday!
One morning then, arrayed in my official uniform as General In-
spector of the It. A. Division, and armed with a sufficient supply of
copper and small silver medals bearing the likeness of Her Gracious
Majesty, wherewith to decorate those fortunate persons who should
have the honour of holding my stirrup, I mounted my spirited Danish
charger Bukjomprhe, who has carried me bravely through many a
field of cattle, and lightly touching him with the spur while I reined
him in tightly on his brand new silver-threepenny bit, I caused him
to execute three demivolts and two caracoles, which brought all that
there was most beautiful in the neighbourhood to the windows, to
whom, kissing the tips of my fingers, I gracefully bent to my saddle-
bow, and then clearing the railings at a single hound (Bukjomprhe
never makes two bounds at an obstacle), I dashed across the verdant
sward of Hyde Park, swam the Serpentine, and taking the single iron
post and rail in my stride, my gallant steed shot past the Park-
keeper, who, as an old soldier, was standing at the double-salute,
ana, in less time than I have taken to recount this, we had passed
through the two first Court-yards, and were standing, my gallant
steed and I, without a hair turned, or a muscle quivering, at the
inner portal of Sir Frederick; Leighton, Bart, and P.R.A.
The President's Chief-Oil-and-Colour-Man, in full Academic
livery (it was devised by Miciiael Angelo for the President of the
Venetian Art Society as part-payment of a sum of money lost at
cinque-cento to the lllimito Loorenzo, known as the Artful Doge
of Venice, and recently presented to Sir Frederick by a descendant,
in as straight a line as possible, of Loorenzo's), descended the steps,
and, in reply to my inquiry, expressed his extreme sorrow at his
being unable to disturb the President at that moment.
Sir Frederick is not yet up," he said, in answer to my inquiry,
"and Herr Joachim is behind a curtain, playing the fiddle to him.
"A Herr on the violin!" I exclaimed with exquisite humour ; and,
springing lightly out of the saddle, in another second I rushed up-
stairs, and was in the President's zliimber-zimmer, as we used to say
in Hanover before it was annexed.
On seeing me, the President looked out from underneath the bed-
clothes (Joachim, unaware of my intrusion, was still performing his
sonata behind the curtain which divides the zliimber-zimmer from
the habilimento-appartemento, or dressing-room, as we used to say
when I was an Art-student in Umbria), and murmured, lazily,
"Caro mio.' . . . can't help it . . . doing 'The Sluggard,' you
see "And he pointed to that exquisite piece of sculpture, which
will soon be before the eyes of an admiring public.
"But," I said, after passing several encomiums on the statue, " I
want to see the ceiling.
"My dear fellow, that's why I'm so done,'' Baid the President,
yawning. "After the ceiling I'm floored." Then, raising his voice,
he called out, "Joachim, my boy, you've often brought down the
house, bring down the ceiling to show to the Herr Inspector."
The eminent and herculean violinist, staggering under the weight
of this colossal work, was a sight never to be forgotten. I examined
it in the courtyard, and being unwilling again to disturb Sir Frede-
rick, for " 'Twas the voice of the Sluggard, I had heard him com-
plain," I left the ceiling, with its Cupids and Muses and Lyres and
dancing-girls and pipes, to the care of the attendants, and vaulting
on to Bukj bmprhes back—he was getting a bit restive—I careered
to High Art Row, and throwing the reins to a passer-by, I cautiously
entered Studio No. 2. but promptly retired with a " Beg pardon, I'm
sure!" having caught signt of a model in such a state of attire as
left nothing whatever to my vivid imagination.
My old friend Horsley, R.A., was after me in no time. "It'sonly
a lay figure," he cried out, over the banisters.
"Fact? " I asked, suspiciouslv.
"Truth," he answered, with his hand on his heart, bowing over
the banisters.
"Naked truth?"
"My Lady," said he, winking and chuckling. "Come up!" he
added, as if he were addressing Bukjomprhe, not his rider.
"'Scuse me, Mr. Horsley, I replied, "but I'm a married man
with a character to lose, and before I consent to enter, I must know
who it is you have got in your studio?"
He leant over the banisters, and in a hoarse whisper—that is
speaking hoarsely—he said,
"My Lady!"
I would hear no more. "Horsley, farewell!" I said, and in another
minute I was in the saddle. I have since regretted my too precise
virtue, having ascertained that " My Lady" is only the title of one
of the pictures with which the veteran Academician is about to startle
the public in this forthcoming May. The First of May is just the
time for "My Lady;" but My Lord" ought to be with her,
likewise " Jack-in-the-Green" and Mr. Merryman.
I pulled up at my old friend's, Sir John Everett Mlllais', Bart.
In answer to my summons, the door was immediately opened, and
the Bart's head popped out. '' Not to-day, family's out of town,'_' he
said; but on catching sight of my face, he came

your pardon, but took you for the baker, and the house is shut up
just now! Can't offer you to have a pull at anything, except a pull

did as the Dying Naturalist. Can't show it to'you now. House shut
up, and I'm going to bed for a holiday. I '11 tell you what though,
I m doing a real big historic work that '11 take the wind out of Titian
and knock Vandyck and Velasquez into a cocked hat."
"The subject?" I asked.
"I '11 tell you," replied the B<art, "and you only," and thereupon
opening the door half an inch wider, and squeezing a bit of himself
out over the door-chain, he whispered in my ear," .... My!
It is . . . ." Stupendous! I was so staggered by the informa-
tion that I had not heard the slamming of the door behind me.
Once more I sprang into the saddle, and galloped away in the
direction of Alma-Tadema's.
Just in time for a classical luncheon. There, in a grove of orange-
trees, lay the painter on a marble seat near a fountain, care-
lessly quaffing Falernian from the interior cask, while Greek maidens
and boys stood around serving him.
"What have you got there?" I cried out cheerily; for, truth to
tell, I felt a bit peckish.
"An Apodyterium," the Painter replied. "Have some?"
"e<w£!" I said, in excellent Greek, and, giving my horse into the
care of a Greek Slave, I accepted a plateful, for I am always glad to
make the acquaintance of any new dish. I was hungry, and took
the first spoonful down at a gulp. Ahem! .... "No more Apo-
dyterium for me, thank you, if this is it," said I to myself mentally;
but to the glorious Artist I merely said, "Food for the Gods,
0 Tadhma! Have you Borne rare Chian or Falernian wherewith to
wash it down?"
No sooner suggested than poured out. I drank it off at a gulp.
Perhaps my face betrayed my true feeling.
"It has been in bottle some two thousand years," said the glorious
Tadema, simply. "I'm afraid," he added, after just sniffing it,
"it is a little gone."
In less than another minute I had followed the wine's example. I
was, I felt it, "a little gone." The slaves carried me out into the air,
and bathed my forehead with the water from the sparkling foun-
tain. Not otherwise did they deal with the heathen temples—
when fevered—of old.
Slowly I allowed Bukjomprhe to saunter down the street. I was
aroused from my reverie by the sound of wild beasts roaring and
growling. The Danish horse pricked up his ears, and refused to
move. The noise came from behind a high wall close to us. Rising
in my stirrups, and standing on my well-trained steed's bask, I was
able to see the cause of the disturbance. There was Briton Riviere
standing at his easel, with paints, pots, and brushes, while opposite
him, properly grouped, were a lion, a lioness, and three jackals.
"Come in!" says he. catching sight of me on the top of the wall.
"Come in! they won't hurt you. It's only their play. Lie down,
will you!" This lost command was addressed to an old lion, who,
being disengaged at the moment, had slily made for that part of the
wall over which my left leg had just appeared. "No, thank you!"
1 replied, nothing daunted. "Just tell me your subject, and I '11
look in again, when you 're disengaged."
"The name of my picture," said M. Riviere, mysteriously, "I
will whisper to you; but breathe it not in Gath." I gave the required
promise as to Gath, and included Bath, to neither of which places
nave I any idea of going. Then he whispered it to me over the wall,
and I cantered gaily away, singing:—
"Oh, he told me in a whizpah,
That his picture's name waa Kizjah."
And on I went again until Bukjomprhe mode a stumble. It is most
rare with him; there was something in it. There was—in the shoe:
a stone. And we were close by an A.R.A.'s house. The intelligent
animal's hint was sufficient. Tying him up to a ring by the door, I
strolled in among the oak-trees and over the bridge: the swans are
floating down the stream: the whole scene breathes quiet and peaceful.
Yonder sits a gentleman in the costume «f the last century, over
whose head some summers have past; on the terrace are two ladies
and a little dog: they are shaking hands, or leading a letter.
"Mark us! they are saying.
-The gentleman turns towards me, and in a second I turn to Stone.'
Stone /—to Mr. Marcus Stone—and I congratulate him on having
struck out an entirely new and original line this year. He waves
his hand to the swans, the bridge, the trees, and the ladies. "This
is how it is done," he says; and, feeling that I only belong to the
"so-called" nineteenth century, I retire.
"Ah, what a happy life is an A R.A.'s, is it not, my Buk-
jomprhe?" I ask the brave old horse, who says " Neigh," by way of
reply. Then we trot on to Mr. Fildes, who has anticipated my
arrival by looking out of a small window, and shouting, "Don't
in! It's Venice"—and so I ride on. "Chutnee as usual ?" I
shout as I pass Rajah Prinsep's establishment. "We've finished
tiffin," he says, looking out from under a punkah, "and I'm going
away for the day." This saves trouble, and I do not descend. But
I ask myself, is this Oriental hospitality?
But the hour of One—my hour—is approaching, and as yet I am
only at Dicksee's Land. Dicksee, A.R.A., is at home, but he would
ther not show me his picture, it is so new and original. "I '11 lay a
akes
secret.
"Is it a maiden playing?"
"Hush!" he cries, ' for Heaven's sake! I will not do it again."
We shake hands. "Quod Dicksee, Dichsee," I murmur to
myself—which I explain to the trembling Artist does not mean that
I think he deserves to be sent to "quod "—" but I do not regret it."
Speed thee onward, my gallant steed—we must bo at the Knight's
Castle ere the stroke of Two, then back by the Vale'of Moida and
the Wood of St. John, which to traverse, I have heard, is dangerous
after nightfall. On! On!
The drawbridge is up! The horn is sounded. The Warder is
summoned. "A friend!" The Pass-word. "Water-Colour and
Sir John Gilbert, R.A." Good. The drawbridge is down. Buk-
iomprhe is led to stable by a couple of grooms. "'Ifakins but he shall
be well fed and well watered as his master shall be well quartered,"
cries a hearty voice; and the next minute the good old Knight is
embracing me heartily in the ancient hall.
Pasties are on the sideboard, boars'-heads, barons of beef, flagons
of ale, bottles of Rhenish.
"Many come up! gadso!" says the Knight, as we sit down to
the viands, "here is the finest banquet for thee that Master Chopps,
the butcherly knave, oan serve us with. A Benedicite, holy friar,
and then fall to as best ye may." We do so.
"Gramercy !" quoth Sir John Gilbert, "I've just finished my
work of painting, and by the merry maskins, I know no method better
than this of effectually cleansing and refreshing the palate," and with
a frolicsome wink in his eye, that would have brought the blush to even
the cheek of a Primrose Dame—and that's considerable—he added,
"Here's to ye!" and raising the foaming beaker of right good
English ale to his lips, he did not remove it thence until there was
scarce a drop left to trickle lazily down the sides, as he turned it
topsy-turvy, and fall on to the boards of polished oak.
The repast was protracted into the larg^e hours of the afternoon.
After this we played at the old chivalno game of chuckspear, at
which the Knight is an adept, and I am no bad hand for one rather
out of practice. Hippocras and Metheglin were handed round in
goblets at intervals, and we had a jolly evening of it, while the rain
and east wind had a good time of it outside.
Suddenly I felt ... It was not the wine, for I had not taken
anything to speak of,—but it was that confounded Greek stuff I had
swallowed some hours previously, and which was now doing its
deadly work.
"Good Knight "I began, addressing Sir John.
"By all means," he replied. And, ere I had time to utter another
word, his servitors had advanced, and the next minute I found my-
self, like Christopheros Sly, in a tapestried bed-chamber. . . It
was next morning before I awoke. I will resume my "Grand
Rounds "—but this is enough, so far. A tap at my chamber doer!
Ha! ha! It is a tap, and a right good tap too' A flagon of cool
ale for the morning draught—Sir Knight, I drink to ye!
Yours, The Grand All-Rounder.

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHARIVAKI.
A LIGHT AND LUCY'D HISTORY.
Foe a while the public will put aside its novel reading, and defer
even the latest shilling sensational till the more convenient season
when they shall have finished A Diary of Two Parliaments, whereof
the second volume has recently been issued, and which, ere this
appears, may have reached a second and even a third edition.
The peculiarity of the author of this Diary suggests to me the
idea that if, at any time, a light, unbias'd, eminently readable
History of the Jews under the Kings of Israel and Judah might be
required, a work whose style should be modelled on the Orientalisms
of the Book of Proverbs and Ecclesiasticus, illuminated by a touch
of the humorous method of Dickens, and tempered by observations
after the caustio parenthetical manner of Thackeray, and which
should be illustrated from time to time with apt Biblical similes,
and the happiest Dickensian parallels,—should, I say, an imperious
demand arise for such a remarkable work, then Mr. Henry Lucy is
the man to supply it.
By means of this Diary, the Parliamentary characters who, to most
of us outsiders, are but names at the beginning of speeches in the dry
journalistic reports, and many of them not even so muoh as that, are
Drought, as it were, home to us, and thus the names and individu-
alities of Christopher Sykes, Ashmead-Bartlett, Bradlaugh,
Chaplin, Sir Charles Foster, Randolph Churchill, Hicks, New-
deoate, Serjeant Simon. Dodds, Barttelot, Chamberlain with his
orchid, and Warton with his snuff-box, with many others, will be as
familiar to the present generation, and to the rising one, as were Mr.
Dick, Barkis, Major Pendennis, Dick Swiveller, Oliver Twist,
Winkle and Bumble to the generation now gradually disappearing
from the scene.
The only fault we have to find with A Diary of Two Parliaments—
a title evidently suggested by A Tale of Two Cities—is that this
highly entertaining style of interesting us in politics, makes the
reading of the Debates a much drier task than it even used to be;
for how can we any longer picture such creatures of a humorous
novelist's fancy as are Mr. Lucy's Churchill, his Baetlett, his
"Warton, his Gladstone, and his Cross (Sir Richard) hum-
drumming away through column after column of closely-printed
matter, without even an incident, an entrance, or an exit to vary the
tedious commonplace monotony of an evening's debate P Truth to
tell to the charmed reader of the Diary, these beings belong to the
range of purely humorous fiction, whose actions, apart or in combina-
tion, assist in carrying out the story to its denoument, pointing the
moral and adorning the tale. As regards the story, it is a novel without
a heroine; for it must be owned that, striking as are all the characters
of the men, it is lamentably deficient in female interest. The situations,
however, are all unforcea and natural, and the excitement is well
sustained from the opening of the first chapter to the concluding
sentence of the last. And though, as we have hinted, female interest
is not unnecessarily dragged in—not even to the Peeresses' Gallery—
yet that it cannot be entirely absent is evident from the fact that in
every page of the Diary there is clear evidence of the presence of
a really very "Fair One " of the name of Lucy.

"The measure armed a practically irresponsible Government Department
with power to deal with £800,000,000 of capital so as to manipulate it, and
reduce a very moderate profit into an absolute loss."—General Shareholders'
Verdict on Mr. Mundella's Railway and Canal Traffic Bill.
A veby crowded Meeting of the Proprietors of the Great London
and Central Railway Company was held yesterday afternoon at the
City Terminus, for the purpose of discussing the recent disastrous
Report issued by the Directors, and of taking, if possible, further
action thereon.
The Chairman, who was very pale, and had to be led to his place
on the platform, and was evidently suffering from acute nervous
prostration, said he hardly knew how to open the proceedings. They
were, he regretted to have to say, of such a very gloomy character,
for the facts and figures that he had to submit to the meeting were
to him, not only in his official capacity as Chairman, but in his
personal and private position as a debenture holder, quite shocking
and overwhelming. A year and a half since, what was the position
of the Company i Their Debenture and Preference Stock stood
respectively at 125 and 133, and they were paying their ordinary
Shareholders a dividend of 6J per cent, per annum. This was when
they were getting £4 a ton—a reasonable rate for the conveyance of
Steel Rails, Bath Bricks, and Sardines, which enabled them to pay
their way, and satisfy all parties. But what was their position
now, under the provisions of Mr. Mundella's iniquitous Bill? On
appeal to the Board of Trade their charges had been cut down; and,
whether they could afford to do it or not, they were now forced to
convey the selfsame goods at three farthings the hundredweight.
The result was only what could be expected, and he, the Chairman,
hardly had the strength to communicate it to the Meeting. (A Voice,
"Let's know the worst!") Well, if they wished it, he would go
on. The figures he had to place before tnem'were most dispiriting
—more, they were quite heartrending; and it was almost with a
sense of blank despair that he announced to those assembled to hear
his statement, that not only were there no assets available for any
dividend on the Ordinary, Preference, and Debenture Stock, but
that the half-year's takings left an absolute deficit, the working
expenses exceeding the receipts by a considerable amount, to meet
which the Company have to part with a portion of its rolling stock,
and half their terminus, and reduce the fees to its Directors. The
extinction of the whole line as a Commercial undertaking could only
be a matter of time. Personally he was ruined. All his property
was invested in the 4 per Cent. Debenture Stock of the Company,
which was now quoted at 13, and he never expected to Bee it touch
any higher figure. He could only conclude by saying that the
prospect, when he looked at it, brought the tears to his eyes.
Upon the Chairman resuming his seat—which he did, evidently
overcome with emotion—a scene of indescribable confusion followed;
the proposition of a Shareholder that the Meeting adjourn in a body
for the purpose of breaking the windows at the Offices of the Board
of Trade, being carried with enthusiasm.

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 29.—" It's quite clear," said
Rakdolph, surveying the opposite benches this afternoon, "that
when we build new House, we must make provision for extra corner
seats on the Liberal side."
Situation certainly growing embarrassing. Bad enough before
Chamberlain and Trevelyan came out; now things have grown
beyond all possibility of arrangement. Fortunately Henry James
doesn't seem to hanker after corner seat. Content to sit anywhere
so that he doesn't inconvenience other people. But Hartington
must have corner seat. Proposed to appropriate Forster's old
place won after desperate conflicts with Dr. Lyons. But Dodds
claims reversion; not inclined to yield to Hartington. Goschen
holds on to his corner seat on third bench above Gangway.
Chamberlain, showing sudden interest in prayers, managed, to-day,
to get Bright's old corner seat. But what if Bright had happened
to come down, and how, if Chamberlain misses prayers and comes
in half-an-hour late, and finds Peter Rylands installed? Tre-
velyan, with characteristic modesty, sat anywhere he could find
room, but gradually worked his way to corner seat on fourth benoh
below Gangway, where in happier days he had sat a private Member.
The same place, the same man, but, Ah me! how altered.
"Trevelyan," said Hahcourt, "is much too good for House of
Commons' daily food. He is too sensitive, too highly pitched, too
anxious lest he do the wrong thing. I don't think you d find that
even two years of Ireland would whiten my beard (supposing I had
one), or age me by ten years."
Question of corner seats will have to be dealt with sooner or later.
There's more coming, they say, and there's not a corner seat to let.
Gladstone in high feather. Spirits seem to go up as his old col-
leagues go off. Rather likes secessions than otherwise. Announced
introduction on 8th April, of Bill for "the Future Government of
Ireland." "Ah!" said Randolph, "even he daren't speak of it

ment of Ireland."

bring Land-Leaguers into contempt. "The bhoys" determined to
let him in. To-day, being First of April, appropriate occasion. Con-
cocted thrilling story about proceedings at Election of Poor Law
Guardians at Tralee. Represented that the Mary Street Branch of
the National League in Tralee threatened any voter who supported
Mr. John Duadon, Conservative candidate, and opposed William
Flynn, the Nationalist. Drink generously supplied, and a man
named William Denny brought into Tralee dead drunk, occasioning

back all brought into action to
demonstrate that " it only needs
strong pressure to induce foreign
countries to adopt a Penny
Postage." "This agitation,"
Reid said, clearing a fresh
space around him, as a settler
clears an opening in a prim-
eval forest, "goes back in
its origin to the time when in
this country we had succeeded in esta-
blishing a Penny Postage."
"Well," said Willie Bright, who
sat on the bench below, wearing a new
hat, "I don't care how far back the
agitation went; but as it seems to promise to go forward for some
time, 1 '11 go and look at the evening papers."
Dr. Cameron moved to disestablish and disendow Scotch Church
right off. Debate enlivened by promising maiden speech from
Rodehtson of Dundee. House thought it had enough on hand with
Ireland. Decided by 237 Votes against 125 to leave Scotch Kirk
alone for the present.
Wednesday.—Chaplin, that many-sided man, came out in new
character this afternoon. Bill for Allotments and Small Holdings
brought in. In absence of Jesse Collings, engaged at Ipswich,
Chaplin opposed Bill. But, as he explained, with a tear dimming
his eyeglass, only on
account of its machi-
nery. With its object
he had the profoundest
sympathy. If there
was a creature in the
world whom he most
esteemed and res-
pected, it was the
Agricultural Labourer.
He would give him
small holdings if he
insisted, but would be
happier if he would be
so good as to take large
ones. Harcourt in-
conveniently reminded
him of very different
views expressed a
couple of months ago.

it would fail in its obvious effort to induce dissension between him

Time. Allotments Bill talked out.
Thursday. —Lord Kensington and Lord Stalbridge (better
known as Lord Richard Grosvenor) inducted to seats in the House
of Peers. "Good Whips, when they retire from business, go to
the Lords—eh?" said Wolverton, welcoming the new-comers, who
hung timidly together like young girls just "out." Many nights
spent in Lobby together; heard the chimes of midnight, and long
after. Lovely and pleasant in the Commons, in the Lords they are
not divided.
"We'll tell together again yet, Kensington," said Lord Stal-
bridge, as they walked out hand-in-hand.
"Yes—but we get home so confoundedly early; and besides,
there's no bench by the doorway where one can go to sleep with one
eye open, and spring up to catch Members going out without having
paired."
In the Commons, De Cobain has come to the conclusion that he
won't ask any more questions. He is one of the Members for Belfast.

Government must be called immediately to account. Put down
question for All Fools' Day, reciting blood-curdling details, and de-
manding " whether Her Majesty's Government would take steps to
set aside the election?" On arriving at House, found telegram
awaiting him. All a hoax. No Mary Street Branch of League at
Tralee. Mr. John Duadon a myth, and so were Mr. William
Fltnn and Doctors Murray and Mulealy. Stomach-pump a
phantom. Only person in Tralee named William Denny, an
esteemed local leader of the Orange party. De Cobain found he
had a sudden and urgent engagement elsewhere. Not in his place
when Question put. But Tim Healy with inimitable gravity
dragged it all out. A fine light-hearted lot, the bhoys!
Business done.—Crofters' Bill in Committee.
Friday Night.—Randolph in his
place at question time. Stayed to
listen to discussion on Motion about
Diplomatic Agents Abroad. Thought
he would go to dinner. This debate
might last another hour or so. At
any rate nothing much would be
done after it. So strolled off to
dinner, and strolled back a little

TO BASHFUL AUTHORS.
It must be an awful thing nowadays to be a bashful Author, if
there are any. The terrors of his life, as soon as he becomes anybody,
are growing impossible—and anonymity his only refuge. A friend
of ours who writes lectures and tales has consulted us, as the recog-
nised Dean of Letters, on what is to be done. His one desire is to do
his work to the best of his power, and then to hear the least he pos-
sibly can about it, and do some more. There really are a few like
that still. Of course the proverbial good-natured friend wiU bo
oareful that he shall hear or anything ill-natured enough: but that
is quite proper. But what of this? A terrible person called Stomaky
or something like it, has established an " Agency," and writes to our
unhappy friend that, for a consideration, he will supply him " with
all comments, criticisms, &c, from the entire British, Colonial and
Foreign Press, on yourself, your lectures, or any subject in which you
may be interested." Underlined as in the original. As our friend
happens to be interested in everything that goes on, Stomaky's work,
in this respect, would seem to be cut out for him. But what a ghastly
threat! I may add," finally adds S., "that most of the principle
(sic) Actors and Actresses, among whom are O. B. Silts, Esq., are
already subscribers." Whether the omnivorous Sims are an Actor or
an Actress, our friend, who has heard of him but as an Author, does
not know. But poor Sims, to have his little weaknesses thus adver-
tised! Pollaky was nothing to Stomaky.

PROCEDURE.-A FACT.
Old if.P. "Aw—I say, Robins. 'Xtraordinary thing all the Seats
TAKEN AT THIS EARLY HOUR!"
Official (of many years' standing, who doesn't approve of recent changes). "You
see, Sib, it's all these 'ere New Members. Early in the day they 're
'ere, and then, when the Gentlemen comes down in the Afternoon,
mere ain't no room for them!"
"GRAND ROUNDS."
Chez 31. Herbert, H.A.—"Ah, cherami.'" exclaimed the eminent Acade-
mician, "I 'ave give myself une petite vacance,—vat you call in ze angleesh vich
I do not most speak, mais je Vadmire,—I give myself a leetle olidays."
"Then you've got no piotures to show this year," I sighed, with an expres-
sion of heartfelt and sorrowful disappointment on my countenance.
"Ah! vous ne me comprenez pas—you not me comprehend. I mean, I
should 'ave like to 'ave painted one, two, tree dozen picture,—mais, httas, I 'ave
only painted seven!" Unfortunately I was at the moment suddenly overcome
by the heat of the room, and was unable to wait and examine these works of
Art. "Au revoir.'" were the last words I heard as I descended the front
door-steps. "To the see-again!"
At P. II. Calderon's.—I found the Cald'ron stirring. There stood Don Philip,
Knight of the Brilliant Brush, leaning against a pillar of the noble portico,—
under whioh I cantered up to the house,—and prepared to receive cavalry.
"Don't get down," he said, lighting another cigarette, "I '11 bring 'em out to
you—they re in the haLl ready for Burlington House. First-rate light for
seeing them here."
Sitting carelessly in my saddle, I examined the first of the lots at my leisure.
"I could look at this, I murmured, "for years!"
"Si Signor!" returned Don Furpro; "but I can't hold it for more than
twenty minutes."
Then he fetched the others: and the others fetched me. The public will not
be disappointed, I think, with the works of Don Philip Calderon this year,
—but that of course is a question of what the public expects. Adios! Adios!
Frank Dicet/'s.—" The Master is not in," said a humble pupil, who offered to
hold my gallant steed Bukjomprhe for a consideration. So I walked into the
Studio, and had there been anything to find fault with, I should have walked
into the Artist. Could I look at his picture without at once, Weglike, dropping
into, poetry.
0 Frank Dicky,
Nicey! Nicey!!
And treading lightly so as not to waken "the Sleeping Beauty," I sped down
VOL. XC. B
the stairs, and throwing largesse to the pupil, and bid-
ding him follow in the steps of the excellent maitre, I
trotted off to the next on my list.
"Many pictures?" I asked, as Frederick Goodall
slid down the banister-rail and alighted flop, in his
good-humoured way, on the hall floor.
"Only four," says he, pausing for breath.
"Only four," I return; "but good all, eh?"
Doubled up with irrepressible laughter I left, im.for
1 was obliged to hurry on, and couldn't Btay till he had
recovered.
Up an avenue, across a bridge, over a piece of water
where a miniature yacht was at anchor, I oame upon
the Viking Brett, R.A., in a tent refreshing himself and
a youthful assistant witn a lively game of skipping-rope.
What cheer, Skipper ?—and his boy!" I snouted. A
lovely garden, a perfect Eden! "I see you're under
canvass, as usual.
"Ay, ay, my lad! " he returned. "Nothing like it.
Let's make it three bells, and avast heaving! Belay
there! Yeo ho!" And so we went down into the cabin
to lunch. His toast was'1A fair wind—and a good sale!"
Grog was served out all round, and after drinking the
Skipper's health and partaking of junk and salt beef, I
weighed anchor (not much more than before luncheon),
and getting aboard H.M.S. Bukjomprhe. put about, luffed,
got on the port tack, and, Bukjomprhe answering the
helm, we made for the Frith.
A cordon of police was about the door to keep off the
crowd. Giving Bukj omprho in charge, I opened my cloak,
showed my brilliant order—inscribed in diamonds " Pass
one to the Studio "—and was at once ushered into the
Artist's Sanctum. Royal Highnesses, Dukes, and
Duchesses were there, but towering far above them all
was the Great Colour Moralist, J. W. Frith, R.A.
"Come," ho whispered to me, " come into my Sanctis-
simissimum, and I'll show you my chef d'auvre."
Then we retired from the giddy aristocratic crowd.
The Great Moral Colourist touched a jewelled button,
and a tray laden with . . . . but no matter; to
say more were to betray confidential hospitality. A few
choice . spirits looked in: thon all was bumpers and
banjos. Don't tell me that Frith, R.A., is a dry
colourist. I saw no more pictures that night. But if
the works of Frith, R.A., this year are not the best,
the truest-to-naturest, the in a general way superla-
tivest that ever were seen, then am I very much mistaken.
After this I rode round to the houses of soveral other
distinguished Artists, including Sant, R.A., who showed
me rows of pictures, but "no rows without a thorn,"
and then it was, as the public will see in May—" We
May be happy yet," he sang merrily. Then I looked in
on Mr. Burgess. After Burgess could I do Moore?
No—so parting with Bukjomprhe to Colin Hunter, who
will find him useful for the Colin Deep Harriers, I bade
farewell to the Artists, and finished was the inspection
of The Grand All-Rounder, t
Benevolence and Boots.—Success to Mr. Chance,
the Police Magistrate, in the beneficent operation of
raising a fund to provide boots for poor children. But
unhappily the boots may be provided, and the children,
aB well as Mr. Chance's endeavour, yet remain bootless.
For several years Mr. Framcis Peek gave £1,000 yearly
with the same intention, but to small purpose. Although
the money was disbursed by means of the Charity Or-
ganisation Society, "it was found that in about half
the cases the boots were speedily pawned." Pop went
the boots, up the spout—difficulty of boot distribution
two to one. Again, in the experience of a Board School,
"a benevolent person provided boots for two poor
children, with the result that, for weeks after, dozens of
the other children came without boots in the expectation
that they, too, would be provided with boots by the
same benevolent agency." Teste, "W.," bearing wit-
ness in the Post. Sad, to see how the aims of charity are
apt to be frustrated by recipients presumed to be honest
who turn out no better than freebooters.

ber for Cork to support him?

THE MAN OF THE SIX CONDITIONS.
A Letter to the S.S.S.S. {Secretary Sicklycal Sensation Society), care of Medium Punch.
Sir,—I have been reading about you in the Spectator, and you alone can
help me at my need. I've never suffered so much from night-Mayor since
dining at the Mansion House. Is that stately periodic making a joke, or does
"Multiple Personality" (the title of the article) really mean anything? The
arch-thinkist, Mr. Leslie Stephen, says that you can always think if you
shut your eyes. There are men who seem to look on " thinking" as a kind of
tangible profession, like brewing. If shutting your eyes does it, good. "The
thinking man! the thinking man!"—remarkable person, and hints for parodies.
There is a suggestion of Poet Gosse about it. The main point about the think-
ing man is, that, Like the wise cobbler, he sticks to his last, and never does any-
thing. I often shut my eyes. So do many. But, as a rule, I think I think
best, for practical purposes, when I keep them open. But I digress; it's a way
I have as a non-thinkist. About that article on "Multiple Personality," dear
Mr. Secretary. "You do more good," it says, "by the tacts to which you call
the public attention, than by your own ideas about them." From one thinkist
to another, that seems a little rude. But I dare say it's true. Probably you
might reply with equal force that the article does more good by calling atten-
tion to you, than by anything on earth it has to say about you. Prom thinkist to
thinkist, rude again. But again, I dare say it's true. My own impression is—
(in a drama this would be called an " aside5')—that neither of you does any good
at all to anybody, and that if either gets any attention at all, it will be my doing.
At all events, I will do all for both of you that I can. For I am essentially
a Philistine. I think but little; but I manage to do a good deal, and I imagine
that that is what a Philistine means. Not a bad idea to have called this an
Epistle to the Philistines, or an Epistle from a Philistine. I will remember it
another time. But how I do digress. Why didn't I shut my eyes?
"Brief let me be"—as The Facts remarked to the Attorney-General. But
those Facts were not in it with these. Mr. F. W. H. Myers (the number of
whose initials is not, under the circumstances, at all to be wondered at) has dis-
covered a man called Louis the Fifth. Why, I don't know. He has six different
conditions of being. In one, he remembers the whole of his life. In the other
five, only five different parts of it. Beyond this, Spectator drops four conditions,
and only treats, from your report, of two. But they are quite enough. Louis V.
is sometimes paralysed on the right side, and only
his left brain acts, whatever on earth that may mean.
Louis V. is then "arrogant, violent, and profane."
But tickle him with a _ soft iron (though I never
saw one) on his right thigh, and the paraly sis'and the
thinking-business change sides. The left side stiffens,
and the right brain acts. Louis V. then becomes "in-
stantaneously quiet, modest, and respectful, speaking
easily and clearly, and able to write a fair hand." He
ought to be kept tickled. But Spectator ought to have
gone on to tell us about your four other conditions,
whereas he only speculates upon the effect of one-quarter
right brain and three-quarters left brain; five-sixths
profanity, and one of a fair hand; and but no, it
is impossible to proceed. Louis v., I am not sur-
prised to learn, is in an Asylum. The wonder is that
everybody who sees him tickled isn't. I am, nearly, from
reading about it. But if Louis V. would like to
go round the country on a show tour, and requires a
boss, let him remember me. I will give him a round
per-centage, and provide the softest iron I can. Think
of me, Mr. Secretary, from that point of view.
But there is a moral to all things, and I want you to
think of me from another. Consider me as a case for
the Sicklycal myself: for I can positively confirm
Louis V.'s experience. I have long been engaged upon
writing a history of the Frenoh Revolution, and as soon
as I began to write it, I got a stiff neck. The expe-
rience regularly recurred, and the stiffness was always on
the right side. I found too, in spite of myself, that my
sympathies were always with the aristocrats, whereas I
wished to be impartial. When I read of Mr. F. W. H.
Myers' friend, all became clear. The guillotinable
muscles were sicklycally affected. It was my left brain
which had this one-sided tendenoy. I saw the cure. I
tickled the right side of my neck with my softest poker.
At once the stiffness went out of it, and attacked the left.
At the same moment all my sympathies were transferred
to the mob; and ever since I have known where to tickle,
in order to get my sympathies in the right place for the
moment. I can be one-sided either way I want: and
what more can historian desire? As Spectator remarks
(wisely premising, if there be evidence for it) "the right
hemisphere of my brain implies the activity of my .lower
nature." My right hemisphere sympathises at once
with Communism. I can curse fearfully when my left
neck is stiff. I plaoe myself unreservedly in the hands of
the man of the three initials. What a shilling dreadful's
worth I should be! Or for the matter of that, Louis V.
either. Convinoedly yours,
Stratton Strawxess.

THE TWO GRAND OLD MEN, WHO DIVIDED THE HONOURS OF LAST WEEK BETWEEN THEM.
OUR VISITING LISZT.
WrmiN one fortnight to have seen Cardinal Newman, aged
eighty-six, officiating, to have shaken the won-
derful hands, and talked with the Abbe Liszt,
aged seventy-six, and to have heard Mr. Glad-
stone's great oratorical effort, at seventy-seven,
is indeed something to be remembered in a life-
time. And I may note that those who heard
Mr. Gladstone finish at eight o'clock, could
have heard Mr. Tbevelyan commence his manly
explanation at ten, and could have also heard
Canon Liszt play at Mr. Walter Bache's
Reception, at the Grosvenor Gallery—another
memorable event—at eleven o'clock the same night. If I contrived
to be in two places at once, depend on it I shall keep the secret of my

mysterious power to myself; so let us return to St. James's Hall on
Tuesday the 6th.
Now for the Santley—I should say the Saintly—Elizabeth, whose
beautiful story Dr. Franz Liszt has set to music. I am not going
to descant on motif, thematic materials, minor sixths, Major Sevenths,
—this last is not a military title, and Major Sevenths is no relation
to Major Griffiths, Author of that most interesting History of
the Garrick Pictures,—nor will I do more than merely touch lightly
upon, or hint at, sequences, agitatos, crescendos, innuendos, big-and-
little-endos and neverendos, whioh go to make up the classic form of
all Oratorios.
If I myself do not quite agree with the Composer on every score,
yet, on the score of his venerable age and character, I would willingly
yield to him in everything where first principles are not absolutely
concerned; and if I personally admit, that, had I been writing
St. Elizabeth, I should not have used certain passages,—specially

those in St. James's Hall:—if I own that I should not have Drought
in a violonoello (an unwieldy instrument, and a great deal of trouble
to carry) when a flute (which is portable) woula have done as well:
if I allow that I should have written a hunting song in "G up,
with an under-movement of "G G;" if after Chorus of girls and
boys playing and romping I am sure I should have introduced
several serious strains, followed by a limp-motif and a doctor's bill
for the parents,—if, I say, I should have done all this and more,
it is not that I set myself up against so great a Master as Canon
Liszt,—for I should be as a pea-shooter against this big gun,—no,—
it would be only to show that in this Musical World (the paper of
this name, by the way, is full of
interesting matter) there are two
- ways of treating the same subject,
and that one of them—no matter
which—is not absolutely devoid of
artistic merit. So much I would
have said to Michael Angelo in
painting, to Phidias in sculpture,
to Shaxspeabe in drama; and so
much, and no more, do I say to the
Reverend Canon Liszt.
The story of Saint Elizabeth is
most touching. The "Miracle of

musical critic as "of doubtful

he was talking about. "Doubtful

Liszt, the Moral Liszt !) anywhere near me that night? And if so,
does his knowledge of "doubtful morality" account for the other-
wise mysterious and unaccountable exchange of a very shabby,
broken-knee'd opera-hat for my brand-new gibus? Doubtful

eye in the head of any one who may be wearing my brand-new hat,
let him send it back whilst it is still in its first ana freshest spring-
time. What had a musical critic to do with morality, specially if
doubtful, when he ought to have been attending to his score.—his
music score, I mean P But I curb my indignation, and, if my hat is
returned, all shall be forgiven, as was timid Elizabeth's little fib
about the Roses; and, all shall be blotted out, just as we hope the
Recording Angel blotted out Uncle Toby's violation of a very clear
and plain commandment. Quo tendimus? Where are we now?

that evening, as the Conductor of Liszt. Now for the story and its
rendering. Little Ludwig, aged four, in the Oratorio represented by
Master Pasket, welcomes his little bride-eleot Elizabeth, Madame
Albani, about the same age, and the two children sing of toffy, cakes,
and buns. Then all go out to play. Suddenly little Ludwig sprouts
up and becomes a young man of twenty-one (Mr. Santley), and
sings a hunting song, in which he rejoices more in being able to
perform a solo on his "bugle, in jubilant measure," than in any
particular form of sport. He meets his wife Elizabeth! She is out
for a stroll. All alone! Dash his Lud-wig! He will give her a
wigging, a Lud-wigging. He is her husband—and he is angry!
But all is soon explained; and here the duet and the chorus (where
did they all come from?), which ends the scene, are among the most
striking things in the Oratorio.
The feature of the Grand Chorus of Crusaders, which immediately
catches the ear, and is the phrase that anyone hearing the Oratorio

only once is bound to carry away with him—not robbing the Oratorio
by any means, which is rich enough to bear the loss—"is," says
analytical Mr. Joseph Bennett, "Jargely built upon the ecclesias-
tical progression," &c, "which so many classical masters—Mozart
and Mendelssohn included—have employed" and which was so
familiar to a correctly trained ear, that I at once remembered, unless
my memory has played me a treacherous trick, the comic-vocalist
motif employed by Sigaor Iachiho Foentni at the Pavilion Hall of
Music, and which is not very unlike this:—

"I did it! I did it!"
"Les Grands Esprits," &c.—and perhaps, after all, the composer of
Signor Foenini's melody, may not be above owning himself indebted
to Canon Liszt, Mozaet, and Mendelssohn.
Madame Albani and Mr. Santley were superb, and the chorus
and orchestra left nothing to be desired, except that Dr. Liszt
should come on again, which he did, having risen from his seat, where
he might have been labelled, "To be left tUl called for,"—and, when
called for, he was, as I have said before, brought on by Madame
Albani, everyone rising and cheering. "Brief let me be!" for
time and space (in this musical number) are limited.
There is such an orohestral storm of wind instruments—a perfect
gale—and a thunder of drums, and a flashing of lightning cymbals, as
was never heard. Miss Pauline Cramer, as the wicked Landgrabber
—a translation of Landgravine—had a cruel anathematising part
demanding more than a cussory notice. She acquitted herself to per-
fection. So too did Mr. Vaughan Edwaedes as the Hungarian
Magnate, who of course is, of all Magnates, the one for whom the
Pole has most attraction. Then Mr. King was promoted to the rank
of Mr. Emperor, and. appeared as the Emperor Frederick the Second,
of Hohenstuffen. What a long line of gourmands the Hohenstuffens
must represent!" Eljen!" to the Hohenstuffens and the Guzzle-
stuffens 1 Some of this great family are still in the public service in

had been telling one another funny stories and enjoying themselves

in with the chorus below; and angels, bishops, magnates, church
choristers, crusaders, peers and people, Hohenstuffens, and every-
body generally, wound up with a grand finish, of which the grandest
part fell undoubtedly to the lot of the orchestral.
More "Eljens," hoorahs, cheers, handkerchiefs, hats, bouquets,
and roses, and then we emptied ourselves out of St. James's Hall
as best we could, and Mr. Littleton Novello must have retired to
his several bars rest that night highly gratified with the success of
the entire series of the Novello Oratorio Concerts, of which this, for
this Season, is the greatest and the last.

actually lives on his own soap all the year round.

ROOM FOR THEM.
"With a view to providing still further accommodation for
Members wishing to attend the next, large Division, the
Speaker has in contemplation the issuing of the f ollowing
list of supplementary regulations :—
Members arriving in Palace Yard over-night, will be
allowed by the local policemen on duty to have, if they
have a fancy for it, a shake-down on the pavement outside.
At three o'clock, a.m., punctually, the doors of West-
minster Hall will be opened, when those Members who have
provided themselves with them, may, if they can manage
it, sling hammocks to the roof, and finish their night's rest
under shelter.
For the refreshment and recreation of those jaded by the
fatigue of watching for the opening of the House ana the
excitement of securing a place for the coming Debate, a
series of athletic sports will be held, during the course of
the morning, on the river terrace. These will comprise,
among other feats, jumping in the Woolsack, throwing the
Mace, and a hurdle-race over Committee tables, and will
be presided over by the Sergeant-at-Arms, and one of the
House Cleaners, selected by lot, who will act as Umpire.
To ensure the accommodation of the whole 670 Members
in the body of the House, the Speaker will provide an
extra row of chairs fastened outside the Galleries, which
will be approached by a ladder from the front Benches.
He will also furnish five places on the top of his own official
seat, which will, however, to prevent confusion, have to be
occupied at an early hour in the afternoon. Strangers and
Peers will be suspended from the roof by ropes, and it is
calculated that by a little additional cramming of two into
one seat in the space thus left vacant, that very nearly the
| whole of the House will be accommodated by the commence-
'of the Debate.
Shortly to be Issued.—A new edition of Sums' Justice,
by Sir Charles Russell, the Champion Attorney-General,
dedicated to Messrs. Hyndman & Co., with instructions as to
how a Government Prosecution may best cave in.
Mr. Haico Thorneycroft sends a piece of Sculpture to

'ARRY'S SPRING THOUGHTS.
Dear Charlie,
How trots it, my topper? Spring's on us at last, dear old pal,
The time when a smart young man's fancy wiU turn to his togs and his gal,
As Tennyson says, though from Halfred the thing seems a bit of a joke;
Jolly little " Spring Clean" about him, with that at and that charwoman's
cloak.
But to hus as ain't poets nor Guy Foxes, Charlie, but ohappies O.K.,
A bit of a brush-up comes proper when April is fair on the way.
The buds is a bustin', my bloater, and 'Arry is free to admit
As he likes to come out with the laylocks, and put on the bloomy a bit.
"All-a-blowing!" you'd say, if you saw me. A suit of smart dittos, my lad,
Sort o' snuff-colour picked out with spinnige, a mixture as isn't arf bad;
Drab gaiters and purple felt rounder, big buttons in mother-o'-pearl I-
Sez Loo, when she met me last Sunday: "Wy, 'Arry, you look like a hurl."
"Hurl be jiggered, my dear!" was my arnser. "Jest look at the Dook of
Argyll I"
Lor bless yer I wouldn't give tuppence for many a Marquis's tile.
Met one—at a Meetin'—last Monday, he leathered old Gladstone to rights,
But the cut of his bags!—well, there, Charlie, 'twas one o' the painiullest
sights.
Wot I say is, a Toff should dress toffy, else 'ow will he pass for a Toff?
It's a maxim a many forget, and your ikey top-sawyers may scoff;
But if Swells mean to keep right end uppards, and out of this Socialist mess,
They '11 'ave to brush up, my dear Charlie, and pay more attention to Dress.
We 're a-droppin' on jolly 'ot times, Charlie, jolly 'ot times, my dear boy,
With your poets turned Socialist spouters, and thousands all out of employ,
It's a fair bloomin' Mix, and no error. Of course it's all thundering rot,
But if them as should Boss us don't watch it, us snide uns 'ull all go to pot.
They 'ate us, these rorty Red Flaggers, they 'ate us like rhubub all round,
Down with polish and perks is their motter,—J know 'em right down to the
ground.
They asked me to jine 'em! Jest fancy me mixing with Radical scum,
Or a-trottin' about through the mud at the tail of a flag and a drum!
"Jerry Jaunders," says I, "you're a juggins, to think you can have me
on toast;
I take sides with the Toffs—oh! don't goggle and snort—it's my pride and
my boast.
Feller feelin' and that, donoher know, and yer don't ketch me lifting a 'and
Agin them as 'ave nobbled the Ochre, or them as 'ave collared the Land.
'The Ochre and Acres means England; and someone must 'ave 'em, you
know.
So wy not the Swells and the snide 'uns? Wot, lay all our Aristos low?
No Millionnaire Mashers, no Sportsmen, no moddles for chappies like me?
J help yer? Not me, Jerry Jaunders; it's all bloomin' fiddlededee!"
Lor, Charlie, old chap, 'ow he looked at me! Taller-faced moulder, he is,
And 'aving jest landed a race, I was lapping a bottle of fizz.
"Ah! 'Arry," sez he, "if you ain't acred up to your chin, it's a fluke,
And when Nature made you a monkey, she spiled the raw stuff for a Dook."
That shows 'ow they 'ate us, dear Charlie, that shows their low Radical spite
Agin anything smart and rekerky. I 'ope it will come out all right,
But I don't like the look of the times; they are 'aving a deal too much run,
These Reds, and the Toffs will be finding, one day, as it isn't all fun.
They want squelching, old pal, they want squelching, from Jerry to
Brummagem Joe.
I'd give 'em wnat for like Jemimer. They're low, the whole lot of 'em, low;
And they'd bring us all down ,to their level, till smart 'uns like Randolph
and me
Wouldn't 'ave no more pull in creation than Muggins the Workman M.P.
I tell you the Toffs must brush up, 'ave a sort of a Spring Clean all round,
'Tisn't shockin' bad 'ats and soft sawder will muzzle the Radical 'ound.
He kicks at Court dress, as you've 'eard, Charlie. Yah! musn't yield,
not a hinch;
'Twill be short-sleeves and reach-me-downs soon, if the Aristos boggle or
flinch.
Let 'em take Our Most Gracious's tip. She's the sort as a cove can respect.
Though March winds blow death with bronchitis, yet Court-dresses must be
low-necked.
That's grit, if you like, and no error. Let bosoms blush 'ot or go blue,
Better nil Brompton Orsepital full of Court Beauties than yield to the screw.
Spring thoughts, my dear Charlie, suggested by togs and the signs of the
times.
I got a bit bosky last night. Has the 'eadache got into my rhymes?
If so, chummy, pardon their dulness along o' the moral they carry,
A moral the Toffs will take on, if they trust theirs admiringly, 'Aery.

A STORY OF GIRTON.
(By R-b-rt Br-vm-ng.)
On, the scholarly girls, too blue,
Who lived at Girton, down by the Cam,
Just where the Cam bids the town adieu!
And who would ever have thought them a
sham—
These girls, and the lots they knew?
Too blue, for the colour of health is red;
And their eyes had the dull, boiled-goose-
berry look
Of maids who are meant to go to bed
When down from their laps flops the out-
spread book,
But consume night's oil instead.
Yet I noticed, like a flowering shrub
Abloom in a desert, one striking grace:
They might " screw like mad when afloat in
a "tub,"
And never get up the ghost of a pace,
But they had a "Bbownixg Club "!
Club which tackled my hardest bits:
Guessed my conundrums—floods of them, toe.
Had ever girls such glorious wits?
The splendid verse of—you know who—
All comprehended by chits!
So, when one waxed ill, it did not seem strange
That the Lady Principal sighed, and said,
"A stoppage of work I must arrange;
To studies recondite she's too much wed,
And from books she needs a change."
"Not my books," the patient cried;
1' Take not the desk that my books cont ains!
For o'er the ' Browxino Club' I preside,
And the mystic masterly fruit of his
brains
Is my solace, glory, and pride!"
Her request being granted, asleep fell she;
The Lady Principal joyed at that;
But when the Doctor dropped in, said he,
It's onlv a bilious attack, that's flat.
Brain trouble? Fiddle-de-dee!"
The desk, it chanced, was not quite closed:
"Why does she clutch it so?" asked the
leech;
The Lady Principal supposed
That to have her dear Bard within reach
Consoled her as she dozed.
"Let's look inside!" And at once—oh,
dreams
Of " Female Culture," and the rest!
They found—no masterly mystic themes.
HoPippa, no Duchess, but—who would have
guessed ?—
A box of Chocolate Creams!
The candid incline to surmise of late
That woman is fit for the vote, I find;
For Parliamentary debate
Discloses the drift of the public mind,
And Woodall's words have weight.
I, for my part, trust woman no more:
At Girton especially. "Why?" do you
ask?
The preposterous chits no longer adore
The liing and the Book—think Sortlello a
task,
And Paracelsus a bore!
NOTES OF MUSIC.
At the Crystal Palace Saturday Concert of
April 3, there was a very good programme.
Herr Franz Ondhicek made his first appear-
ance at Sydenham. Good deal of " Franz"
about this week. He was brilliant. To Miss
Robertson, the Soprano vocalist, who also
received enthusiastic applause, Mr. Punch
says, in the words of the song, slightly altered,
"Sing on, you little bird!" Mr. A. C. Mac-
kenzie's first" Scotch Rhapsody " was splen-
didly played by the Band; the concluding
movement, founded on the air "There teas a
Lad was born in Kyle" is so irresistibly rol-
licking that I fully expected Scotchmen among
the audience to execute an impromptu reel.
But only enthus:asts, who had come'' reeling,"
would have ventured on such a step.
At the New Club, Herr Schalkenbach has
been performing upon his Electric Organ.
His playing is "fair to middling," but his
electrical manifestations are surprising. It is
all very well to cause an illuminated electric
star to revolve during " God Bless the Prince
of Wales:" but even more solid joy might be
generated were Herr Schaxkenbach on terms
of greater intimacy with the tune.
Madame Scht/mann drew a crowded house
at the Monday Pop. on April 5. This charm-
ing lady is the same subtle-fingered, consci-
entious pianist as of yore. Before such a
wife of such a husband it is an honour to stand
hat in hand—on the chance of getting some-
thing dropped into it for the Unemployed.
The Chevalier Leonhasd Emil Bach gave a
Concert devoted to LiszT'sworks, in St, James's
Hall, April 9 ; but you don't want to be Aliszt

I've offen herd as how as it's ony the fust step as gives any

But of the truth as regards the fust step 1 stands conwinced, and I
stands conwicted. It appened somehows this way.
About a fortnite arter my little adwentur, and the werry nex nite
arter my wisit to a sertain Theayter, witch shall be nameless, I was
assisting at a werry swell house in Portland Plaice, where a old
gennebnan lives as was a Wine Merchant in tho Citty, and, like a
senserbel feller as he is, before he left off bizziness he crammed his
seller jolly well full of the best of wines, not forgetting lots of my

and told her all about the Theayter, and the young ladies of the Core

my egsitement, asisted probbably by a few glasses of the '47 Port and
the rather strong glass of sumthink nice as Cook had brood for me, I
got up, and without thinkin for a moment of the hordacious libberty
as I was atakinof, I sed, "It's summat in this style, Cook," and
putting my arm round her hample waste, I begins a dansing! But

MR. PUNCH'S METROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENTS.
Hansom Cabmen.—That no hansom cabmen be allowed to carry
whips, in consequence of their vicious and unskilful use thereof,
whereby many of Her Majesty's lieges have lost the use of one or
both eyes, and been otherwise tortured and disfigured; and that the
drivers of hansom cabs be instructed to encourage their steeds, when
necessary, to further exertions, by gentle and persuasive language
after the manner of Sancho Panza to his ass Dapple.
Four- Wheelers.—That every driver of a four-wheeled cab be
permitted to leave his box and assist in carrying luggage into a
house whenever he can conscientiously affirm that his horse, whether
from advanced age, natural amiability of disposition, or the habits
of a lifetime, can be trusted not to inaugurate expeditions on his
own account.
Infectious Diseases.—That the disinfecting of cabs by means of
tobacco-smoke shall be no part of the professional duties of cabmen;
but that, when necessary, all such purification shall be effected by
properly authorised disinfectants.
The Confidence Trick.—That every cabman, on arriving at the
end of his journey, shall, if interrogated as to his fare, demand the
full legal amount, and no more, and shall not return trustful and
flattering answers, such as "Leave it to you, Captain!" whereby
weak-minded civilians are wheedled into overmuch outlay.
Measures of Length.—That every cabman be compelled to go
through a fortnight's iudging-distance drill, and that he shall not
receive his licence until he have thoroughly mastered the faot that
five hundred yards do not make a statute mile.
Femmes Soles.—That all ladies travelling as femmes soles, who
intend only to remunerate the cabman at the rate of 50 per cent,
more than his legal fare, be recommended, when they have arrived
at their destination, to seek the shelter of the inside of the house,
and to send the money out by a servant, unless they are engaged in
writing novels d la Zola, in which case the study of the vernacular
may be useful.
Saving Life in the Streets.—That any old gentleman whom you
have saved from a painful and violent death by calling to him from
your hansom cab when in danger of being run over, shall, if he
proceed to curse you, and use profane language from the kerbstone
—as he probably will—be at once taken before a Magistrate, and,
upon conviction, fined five shillings.
Wild Beasts.—That any horse which it shall be found necessary
to drive with a muzzle, a Segundo bit, a Bucephalus nose-band,
and a kicking-strap, and which shall require two men to hold him
while the cabman mounts his box, shall be considered unfit for the
streets; and any cabman driving a horse which combines all the
above peculiarities shall be deprived of his licence for a period not
exceeding six calendar months.
Philanthropists.—That every contributor to Punch, which is
synonymous with being a benefactor to the human race, shall be
entitled to be conveyed anywhere within the four-mile radius for a
maximum charge of one shilling.

IN MEMORIAM.
$1$ MWm tftontr* Jfarsto,
Born, July 11, 1818. Died, April 5, 1880.
A sturdy lover of a sturdy land,
He served it, zeal at heart, and life in hand,
With valiant loyalty. A keen strong mind
That fear shook not, and faction could not blind.
That life was sapped, in facing England's foes,
By peril's strain and hate's embittered blows;
And at his country's crisis, he who watched
So jealously her interests, hence is snatched.
Yet not unmarked, unmourned. E'en in the tide
Of fullest conflict, men will turn aside
To lay a well-earned laurel on the grave
Of a stout patriot and a statesman brave.
'' Odi Profanum."—In the Times for April 6, it was told IiowGeorge
Bliss, of Beckenham, was summoned for using " a profane word."
What it was the report did not state. Perhaps it was such a very
"big big D" that the printing and publishing of it would have
amounted to a Capital offence. It seems that, except by bringing
him up before a Magistrate, his neighbour has no other way of
relieving himself of the annoyance caused him by the inability of Mr.
George Bliss to find any other way of relieving himself of annoy-
ances, except by using such awful language as turned the abode of
Bliss into a Pandemonium, and so Bliss was fined two shillings and
one shilling costs—"thirty-six d" altogether—which must have
made him exolaim, "Well I'm Bliss'd!" Now if this Aot, which is
down upon all such deeds (or write it thus, d—ds) were only put into
constant and active operation, why it would produce a sum suffi-
cient to buy out the Irish Landlords, pay the National Debt, and leave
a handsome surplus. Why not revive it?
TRUE PATRIOTISM.
The Corporation, always to the fore when a great or good object is
to be attained, having already resolved to use no iron for then- new
Bridge but what is of English origin and English manufacture, and
that a Committee shall inquire whether City Streets cannot be paved
with Asphalte without the services of Italian Workmen, have, it is
said, determined to follow up their patriotic proceedings by issuing
strict orders to their Hall-keeper and Proveditor that, from the First
day of April, of the present year, not any of the following Foreign
Manufactures shall be allowed, under any stress of circumstances, to
enter within the sacred precincts of their Guildhall.:—
"French Chalk, Spanish Liquorice, Italian Cream, Turkey Rhu-
barb, Prussian Blue, German Sausages, Chinese Lanterns, Brazil
Nuts, Brussels Sprouts, Roman Candles, New York Hams, Venetian
Blinds, Madeira Cakes."
This important matter, like the consideration of the proposed in-
crease to the salary of the City Judge, was considered in secret con-
clave, so we have no report of the speeches made on that interesting
occasion; but it is rumoured in the precincts of Guildhall that it was
proposed by one learned Pundit to add to the list the following
Foreign productions:—" Chicago Chiokens, Civil Oranges, Egyptian
Mummies, Turkish Sultanas, and Florence Nightingales.'' But the
proposition was not agreed to.
Hit It at Last!
Mr. Punch, Sir,
I have seen with contemptuous derision the frantio and
foolish attempts to suggest a proper designation for the Colonial and
Indian Exhibition, to be opened by Her Most Gracious Majesty on
the 4th of next month. England. Wales, and Ireland having miser-
ably failed, Scotland comes to the rescue, as usual. There is but
one designation that combines every requisite, and that is, "The
Kith and Kinneries." I am, &c,

day, April 5.—House of

twenty Peers to hear Lord

iia lk quite a political cha-
racter. Not much heard of

blazed forth on the poli-
tical horizon, threatening
to smash up the Gladstone

only tiU he got back to England and then shook the Ministry to
its centre by flinging his commission in the teeth of the recreant
Minister.
"1 don't know what your Irish plan is," he said, in his interview
with Gladstone, "but I won't have it."
8o he left the hapless Ministry, and was immediately followed by
Chamberlain and Treyelyan.
To-night, wants Zebehr Pacha to be set free. Formed a strong
affection for him on the Rock. But there was a rival in person of
Hamed the interpreter. "Hamed," said Ribblesdale, "is an old
™" now> but his beard grew in Zoological Gardens." House puzzled.
Why, though an old man, his beard should not have been cultivated
in the Zoological Gardens, supposing the ground there was suitable,
did not appear. Besides, why should this Arab have his beard grow
in any garden? But Rebblesdale, having lived three months so far
East as Gibraltar, had acquired habits of figurative speech. He
went on to explain the meaning of his metaphor. "Hamed," he
proceeded, with great solemnity of manner, " came to England as the
personal escort and attendant of the first Hippopotamus that visited
our shores. He learned English in a school in the Borough Road"
"And of such is the Kingdom of Heaven," Lord Rosebeby mur-
mured, quoting from the familiar epitaph.
Hamed greatly enjoyed Ribblesdale'8 conversation with the
old slave-trader. "So excited did he become one day," his bio-
grapher informed the listening Senate, "that he dashed his turban
half off his head; and," Ribblesdale continued, with a knowing
nod at the Lord Chancellor, "an Oriental who takes liberties with
his head-gear is really moved."
Lords as interested in Ribblesdale's narrative as the interpreter.
Lord Halifax suddenly raised his right hand to his head. Thought
he was going to dash off his hat. Contented himself with re-settkng
it on his head.
"It's certainly one of the advantages of civilisation," said Dun-
raven, "that we have in ' toppers' exceptionally favourable means
of expressing emotion. Unsatisfactory to dash your fist at a turban
when you would say 'Dear me!' or 'God bless my soul!' But
what emphasis could be added by banging in your own Sunday
hat, or, better still, letting fly at the other fellow's who's been
astonishing you."
As Rosebeby said, no one who listened to this interesting speech
would fail to hope that now Ribblesdale is released from the
anxieties of office, he will often contribute to the Debates.
Thursday.—"Barks mustn't be out of this business." Mv last
words as I fell asleep last night. Everybody going down to House

be there," I said. But how to get there? Very valorous at night
about getting up in the morning. Quite another thing when morn-
ing comes. Know a fellow who can always get up early; name of
Pincher. Thing to do—get Pincher to call me at Five. Had a
row with him once; bit his ear; but daresay he's forgotten it.
PiNcnER agreed with curious alacrity. Tied string to toe, let end
out of window, and went to sleep, certain to be called. So I was.
Awakened before Five. Violent tugging at string. Thought at
first was caught in trap; then remembered PlNCUEK.
"All right, old fellow!" I said. But it wasn't right. He hauled
away till he pulled me clean out of bed, and jammed me against
wall till, finally, I bit the string. Pincher evidently hasn't for-
gotten that little affair of three years ago; and I won't forget
PixcnER. Wanted him to stay this morning till I thanked him.
"It's Pears's Soap," said Tim Healy. "Capital idea. [Rem une-
rative occupation for reduced Landlords. Drop a.bill in]every hat.
'Use Pears s Soap. Lights only on the box.'"
Joseph still doubtful. "Went over to see what it was all about.
Found that Lord Ernest had been distributing bills setting forth
reasons why an Englishman should oppose Home Rule. Evidently
it was Lord Ernest who had tampered with the hats in the morn-

At Half-past Four House packed from end to end. Chairs
placed on the floor. Ex-Lord Mayor Fowler presiding. Looked

rately cold; wind and rain. Found D. Sullivan at door, waiting
to get in. Raced him across the Lobby, and, in spite of lameness,
won by a neck. Not long in sole possession. Irish Members came
trooping in. Hats of various sizes and qualities began rapidly to
blossom all over the Benches. At Half-past Eight breakfast ready.
Members walked off, leaving House empty. Took opportunity of
playfully mixing up the hate. Retired to Gallery to see the fun.
Great row when Parnellites came back. Decided that it must be
the Ulster Members who had done it. Major Saunderson entering,

choir, and filled side ^Galleries. The Princess of WALES^peered
through the fence before the ladies' cage; got a good view of Prince
of Wales, who sat opposite in the Peers' Gallery. A faint echo of
cheers outside; a brief pause; then Gladstone, with a rose in his
coat, discovered making his way through the crowd by the Speaker's
chair. Radicals and ParneUites leapt to their feet, welcoming him
with ringing cheers and waving of nate. Hartlngton, Chamber-
lain, Trevelyan, Gosciien, and Duke looked on from back bench.
Tremendous oration; nearly three hours and a half long; lis-
tened to throughout with unflagging attention. Voice kept up
wonderfully well, even to the end. More cheering when Premier
sat down; rang through the House till it seemed it would never
cease. But there was more to follow. Trevelyan to speak, and
lift, the curtain from the Cabinet sittings. A pause j all eyes
t urned to where Trevelyan sat, nervously turning over his notes.
"Colonel Waring!" the Speaker cried; at which anti-climax
the crowded assembly uprose with one accord, and went out laughing
and cheering, tumbling over the chairs in their haste to be first in
the rush for the dining-room.
Business done.—Home Rule Bill introduced.
Friday.—" Well," said Joseph Gillis, with a flash of keen dis-
appointment piercing the mist that had gathered in his eyes, "I
never saw the promise of a good fight spoiled in this way."
J. B., since he has taken to sitting above the Gangway, amid the
flower of the Conservative gentry, has so far yielded to circum-
stances as to put on a pair of black dogskin gloves, which look as
if they had been present at many funerals. It is idle to paint the
lily, or adorn the rose; but undoubtedly the unwonted appearance
of these gloves add distinctly to the respectability and responsibility
of Joseph's presence. Being seated above the Gangway, Joey B.
had a full view of the remarkable scene going forward on the
other side. At the corner seat below the Gangway, Chamberlain,
relating history of his connection with the Cabinet. Gladstone,
half reclined on Treasury Bench, listened intently, apparently
watching for something he expected to come.
"Well, Sir," said Chamberlain, continuing his speech, "this
scheme of Land Purohaso was certainly to me a very startling pro-
posal." (Gladstone raised himself on his elbow.) "It involvedthe
issue of 120 Millions of Consols."
Gladstone bounded to his feet, standing erect, with hands crossed
before him, shoulders squared, and head thrown back. "Exactly
liko the Millais portrait, said Agnew. Speaking in severest tones,
lie protested against Land Purchase Bill being brought into discus-
sion before it had been submitted to the House. This only the
beginning of the squabble. Chamberlain wanting to read letters,

lain safely reached the end.

THE LATEST LAY SERMON.
The following letter is said to have been addressed to a friend by
Professor Cruxley, a fortnight ago:—
Of course, like my friend Tindebbox, I am profoundly disgusted
with English politics. The Prihe Minister ought to be known to
posterity as "Disruption Bill." It is a curious fact that our public
men have been steadily growing worse and worse since the beginning
of the century, which seems flatly to contradict the great doctrine of
Evolution and Development, in which, however, I am a firm believer.
The more eminent a Statesman is nowadays, the greater humbug and
hypocrite he is. in my opinion, thoueh the scientific fact of the
Survival of the Fittest," somewhat militates against my theory.
Where can you show me a Pitt? Where a Stratford? The latter's
Irish polioy is exactly what is wanted.
That's the true polioy for you. My opinions are, I assure you, well
worth studying, because an Expert in Science naturally knows every-
thing about politics, also about Theology—and I may say that I have
for ten years past religiously (ahem! to speak conventionally, or
oonventiole-ly) tried (and failed), with a damp towel round my head,
to understand every Bill that Gladstoxe hat introduced in that
time! It has rather interfered with the business of my life, which
is Science; but what of that?
Have you read my EvaltUion of Theology yet? If not, why not?
There's a crusher for that "copious fallacy-monger" and "poor
right honourable rhetorician," if you like!
I view Gladstone, and, indeed, most persons and things, from
which I may call the impartial and superior standpoint. I'm no
end of a speaker myself, but from a Laboratory point of view, I affect
to despise everybody endowed with the gift of eloquence. An eloquent
man is nearly sure to be a scoundrel. That's why I prefer Parnell to
Gladstone, because the former is not eloquent, only superbly ho/iett.
I myself have always been a Liberal. Yet how much jollier and
more comfortable everything seemed when I was a boy! That was
in the days of Tory ascendancy, which of course, as a good Liberal,
I cordially detest. Both parties now are politically insane, and
actuated only by the meanest motives. In faot, if you want real
statesmanlike ability and absolute integrity, I don't know where
you will find it—except, of course, in Tlnderbox and myself.
A MYSTERY.
What is the meaning of this in the current number of the

FINE ARTS.—WANTED, a GENTLEMAN, to take charge and
canvass a new and important Picture. Good references required.
We all remember the sensation that was caused when sundry
unknown people charged pictures at the Koyal Academy with sharp-
pointed instruments, and caused alarming rents and scratches on
valuable paintings. This Advertisement seems to point to a fresh
assault. It is quite right that, if the assaulter took and charged the
picture, that he should be re quired to canvass it; but would not it
save everybody a great deal or trouble and expense if the
let alone altogether? Possibly there is a
that we fail to comprehend.
vol. xc.
CASUAL MUSIC.
A good hall for first-class Orchestral Concerts is sorely needed at
the West End. There is the Albert Hall, which is too large for
almost anything but Oratorio, or manifestations under exceptionally
"drawing " patronage (there is plenty of drawing room), and there
is the Prince s Hall, which is more adapted to the requirements of a
Pianoforte, or other Recital. But if you want to make a 6plash, it
appears a tine qua non to rent St. James's Hall.
So the " Strolling Players "—who from being amateurly dramatio
have "dropped into" music, as Mr. Wegg did into poetry, and I
don't mean to "drop into " them on that account,—gave a very fair
entertainment here, the amateur instrumentalists—more Liszts!—
being leavened with a judicious admixture of professional assistance
in the "wood" and "brass." Mr. Lionel Hume, a baritone, who
sang De Lara's " Mine To-day" to the Composer's accompaniment,
is, if not already a strolling player, rapidly qualifying for enrolment.
The way in which he sauntered through his music, which is nothing
unless impassioned, must have been a revelation of pathetic futility to
Isidore. Of course the Band was what most people had come to hear,
and under the youthful but energetic Conduotor, Mr. Norfolk Me-
gone, it played Beethoven's Seoond Symphony, and Bizet's Suite
"L' ArUsienne" with a creditable amount of precision. The last-
named work is indeed sweet. But the fiddlers want weeding as badly
as any over-grown garden. Half of them don't play, and the volume of
sound produced is poor and undecided. They bow too little and scrape
too much. Otherwise the Concert was well worth hearing, and of
courso it would not have been complete without a work by the Com-
poser of St. Elizabeth. A kind of mental abberation has set in
amongst musical caterers, and so, of course, Mr. Megone (Ochone! Mr.
Megone !) had "got him on the"—programme. Nlbbelunqlet.
WANTED.—A Batch of New Politicians, "toned up" to the
requirements of the Superior Person. One of the tragio
features of the present time is, that the Superior Person has to
stand aside from any participation in Politics. They are not up to
hit mark. He has consequently to look helplessly on while, as Pro-
fessor Huxley temperately and originally puts it, the country is
"going to the devil." What we want are Statesmen whom such
beings as Tyndaix, Huxley, and Lecky can work with. If there
be any such hiding themselves anywhere, let them turn up, and
the qualities of either Mr. Gladstone or Lord Raitdolph Churchill
who, between the pair of them, only anger the Superior Person and
prevent his voting at all. And what's the use of the British Con-i
stitution and the Ballot Act if he doesn't voteP They must bl
prepared, above all things, to defy "average opinion," that is, to
govern without a party, and legislate without a majority. Then
the Superior Persons will support them. But they must not be
eloquent. The Superior Person will supply all that is wanted in
that line. The new Statesmen, "of the calibre of Pm and Bubke,"
must be slow of speech— like Burke, and tongue-tied— like Pm.
Surely here's a chance for a new Party Leader. He will hare
his party ready to hand in the Superior Persons.

character when used as engines of war." This project is
as yet in nubibus. but there, or thereunder, at a convenient

PAGE PROM A BAD WOMAN'S DIARY.
Monday.—Am scribbling this before I go to the Old Bailey. Such
a glorious chance! Young Mr. Yawbobouqh told me last night, as
we walked home from Church, that if I came early he could get me a
place where I could see, what he called, " the whole bag of tricks."
He said he thought it would be "great fun." And I think he is
right. It appears that to-day wiU be the last of the Trial. He said
that it would be " capital, as a real good hanging Judge was trying
the Prisoner." This is most lucky, as I have never seen anyone
sentenced to death. He told me to mind and bring a luncheon-basket,
as when once I had got a place I should " have to stick to it, as there
would be an awful squash." These young men are so fond of slang!
Well, I think I look very nice. Half-mourning out of compliment
to the poor creature in the dock. Estelle has made me look so nice.
I shall take this diary with me in the carriage, as I daresay I shall
have lots of time for writing when I get into Court.
10'30 o' Clock.—Young Mr. Yawbobot/gh has been so kind. Such
a lovely plaee! Can see the face of the Prisoner quite distinctly
without my opera-glass. The Judge such a nice old gentleman, and
so full of jokes! And the Aldermen so funny. It's awfully nice.
And as that dear Estelle put two or three of my favourite novels
into the carriage for me, I nave lots to read while they are going
through the tedious medical evidence. Lots of people I know here,
too. Fanoy that demure little Mabt Frecklkton giving up her
"Poor Visitation " to oome and see the fun! The Jury seem rather
pale—that's because they have been locked up together through the
Sunday. Mr. Yawborough says that they are all in custody, and
yesterday were taken out for a drive in an omnibus. So funny!
The whole thing is very interesting. Another Medical Witness! So
tiresome! However, can read my novel and the Queen. Charley—
1 mean Mr. Yawborough—has furnished me with a lot of literature,
as he said that he " thought I might be bored by some of the Show."
1 o Clock.—Just putting down a few notes after the summing-up
for the Prisoner by her Counsel. She looked so anxious, poor
wretch! while it was going on! I am not surprised, as Mr. Booker-
ville is what Charley—1 should say, Mr. Yawborough—calls " a
duffer." He says that she hadn't enough money to get anyone
better. Charley teas me he would have aefended her for nothing,
and then have got his name in the papers! We laughed so. He is
very amusing. They are going to adjourn before the counsel for the
Crown sums up against her. Now for the luncheon-basket! Not
sorry as all this excitement has made me hungry!
3 o' Clock.—Really a most delightful little pio-nic. The foiet grat
sandwiohes/CHARLEY said, were first-rate. Greedy fellow! Feel
all the better for the sherry and seltzer. The Counsel for the Crown
was simply beautiful. He put the case so neatly and made the
Prisoner, poor wretch, quite angry! From what he says I fanoy she
must have been fearfully heartless. I rather liked the shape of her
bonnet—it suited her pale complexion.
5 o' Clock.—Never more excited in my life. The Judge (as Charley
said) "came out strong." He was so interesting when he explained
the natures of gun-shot wounds, and his snubbing of the Counsel for
the Prisoner was very amusing. Poor young man! he looked so con-
fused when the Judge forgot his name. It was all so funny! And then
when the Jury went out to consider their verdict, it was so exciting!
Of course, every opera-glass in Court was directed at the Prisoner.
Mine was a very good one, and I could distinctly see her tears! Poor
wretch! I dare say it was very trying, but I could not help thinking
why they did not put her in a prison dress—it would have neen more

picturesque!—very much more picturesque! When the Jury came
in, Charley touched my arm (it made me thrill—he really is very
sweet), and said, "I'm sure it's all right." And so it was. The
Judge was most impressive in passing sentence, and nearly made me
cry. But just as I was taking out my handkerchief, Charley said
sueh a funny thing about the black cap that I absolutely roared!
And I told him not to be so silly. And while I was speaking they
took away the Prisoner, and I didn't see her again. So disappointing!
But I think I shall remember her bonnet. It really was most
becoming. I must get Estelle to copy it for me.

GEMS OF THE FIRST WATER.
The Jolly Young Watermen of Piccadilly have opened the Picture
Season. So up the stairs we go with an opening chorus—
Of course we 'ye all heard of the Jolly Young "Watermen,
Who brush and pencil so deftly do ply;
There are amongst Painters no trimmer or tauter men
Than at the Institute, Pic-ca-dil-Zi/.
Their list is brilliant, all painting cleverly,
Though, to complete it, they lack Mr. Bbvbklby.
Of praise it is hard to give each his fair share,
So, pray take advice,—cab or "bus,—and go where
You will find " Entertainment" that's " Linton "—not spare.
Yes, decidedly a "Linton Entertainment," commencing in the
last week of Lint, and just before Oily Week.
Whether they 're all quite up to the High Water mark of former
years, will be a matter of opinion. For ourselves, we don't think,
take 'em for all in all, that they are. But no matter, it is a pleasant
watery-sunshiney exhibition. It ought always to open in April,
the most appropriate month for the Watercolourists; and, to save
our readers intending to visit the Institute time and trouble, we
select Borne Gems of the First Water:—
No. 19. 'Arry and 'Arriet at a Pic-nic. By G. G. Kilburne, R.I.
No. 33. "Look at my New Dressing-gown! I must come out
and show it.'" E. H. Corbould, R.I.
No. 35. "I can't a tail unfold." Arthur Wardle.
No. 43. Bunny'uns. J. Sherrtn, R.I.
No. 99. The Grand " Old Man" Arthur Severn, R.I.
No. 100. Scene from a new Ballet Extravaganza, entitled Boulogne
Sands, at the Alhambra 'Theatre of Varieties,
Leicester Square. New properties, dresses, and
appointments. Costumes by Auouste & Cie.
Music by M. Jacobi. Soenery and grouping
invented by William L. Thomas, R.l.
No. 113. "Trying it on ."' All the charm
of Novelty! Portrait of an Anglican Clergy-
No. 109. Mousc-ical, or man in an ecclesiastical vestment which, not
the Pianist and Fidler. t,emg accustomed to it, he has put on wrong
side foremost. But they will do these things at Llanfynydd, where
they think it's a case of "safe investment," says the Artist, Mart
E. Butler.
Perhaps the real gem of the Collection is No. 216. (See our Illus-
tration of it.) The visitor to the Gallery will be at once struck by
a glimpse of the sportsman's familiar features, who, standing on
one side of the lake, is taking a pot-shot at what seems to be a fine
specimen of the Asinus Scandinavius, or real Swedish Donkey, which
is getting out of the water and attempting, donkey that he is, to
climb the opposite bank. Inspecting the picture closely, the visitor
will entertain no sort of doubt as to the noble sportsman in question
being intended for a representation of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales,


No. 216. "An Anxious Moment; or, What will he do with it?"
who, it appears, when in Sweden, goes out shooting attired in a
saffrony-coloured suit, with pink boots, blue shirt, a bright green
chamois-hunter's hat, and greenery-yallery gloves, which, strange to
say, have had such a startling effect on the Royal British constitution
that H.R.H.'s hair and whiskers have turned the same hue as the
gloves. Or is it that the Artist ran short of colour, and having
painted the gloves first, had no other pigment for the Prince's hair?
Examine it closely, and if it isn't so, then are our eyes jaundiced and
we don't know greenery-yallery when we see it.
In a punt just below are two Swedes, who, evidently not possessing
implioit confidence in the accuracy of the Prince's aim, are trying to
hide themselves away in a place of safety. The agony expressed
on the countenance of the first man in the boat, " Stroke," is power-
fully depicted by the Artist. He has cleverly seized the moment
when "Bow"—of course they are both Swedes—is thinking of his
wife and family at home, and is turning as pale as one of nis own
native turnips. That they have some reason for their trepidation
is plain if you'examine the Royal Shooter, and you will see that his
clear blue eye—the painter has given him such a blue eye! it would
have '.been constructive disloyalty to have
given'the Prince a black one,—is fixed, not on
the long-eared donkey in the distance, which
should be the object oi his aim, but on the two
men in the punt,—distinctly, and severely, on
those two men in the punt. Ah! well may they
quake! For if H.R.H. misses, he will be
angry with these two donkeys for distracting
his attention from the other donkey; and if he
doesn't hit the animal, there's no telling
where the shot mayn't go. So these two men
in a punt will catch it in any case. No wonder,
then, that on the bank,
in a safe position, and
well out of all chance of
danger, a stalwart figure
is kneeling, and, it may No. 369. Mermaid ready
be naturally supposed, dressed, and waiting
devoutly praying for the £or somebody to take
successful issue of the hCT out-°f "e*-
shot. We have christened it "An Anxious
Moment" and, evidently, so it was considered
by the Artist, who—the sly dog!—is in hiding
somewhere well out of gunshot.
After this chef d"ceuvre, others fall a trine
flat, but we give a sketch of No. 369, by Miss
M aude Goodman, and we alsodraw—attention, to
Nos. 460—472. "Gone"—Mad! A Scene

No. 511 saying, "Wonder if she can hear me two doors off?" and
No. 509 chuckling to herself, "I'll put my hand down on a lot of
notes at once, and see how No. 511 will like that.'"
No. 503, we imagine, must be called " Rags and Tatters." Oddly
enough we find it is by Mr.
Harry Becker. A Becker
is associated with rags and
tatters, and this picture at
our elbow — " Becker my
neighbour"—is the "Poor
Becker Girl" We've nothing
left to give her, so—"Not to-
day, Becker," and pass on to
No. 593. The March Past

No. 1019. Sheaves and Thieves. "Lookout,

"How and Where io Fish in Ireland" is just about to be
published by Messrs. Sampson, Low & Co. It may be a useful book,
but surely the first question, as to "How to fish in Ireland," is soon
answered with, "Same as in England, with rod, line, nets. bait. &c."
Then for the second query, "Where to fish in Ireland," surely the
answer is, "in the water—same as anywhere else." Of course there
are queer fish on land in Ireland, as well as elsewhere; but this isn't
what the writer means. And who is the writer P Anonymous; but
we shrewdly suspect that this Guide is by a Pedestrian Angler,
whose name is " Hooky Walker."

NOSE MUTAMUR IN ILLIS.'

Ross's Nose Machine, a contrivance which, applied
to the Nose for an hour daily, bo directs the soft cartilage of
which the member consists, that an ill-formed nose is quickly
shaped to perfection."—Extract frem Daily Paper.
My deab Me. Punch,
I beg to enclose
The account of a plan for improving the Nose,
Half a guinea the price, and very cheap too,
If it only does half it professes to do.
By this wonderfully simple machine the inventor
Declares he can alter the shape of your scenter.
Give the nose of a Roman,
Or fine British yeoman,
Or a Jew, or a Hottentot, or Esquimaux man;
Or if it's your fate
To have had, up to date,'
A crooked one, quickly he'll make it quite straight;
I even would het
You'd be able to get
What Tennyson swears by, the Nez a Lynette.
And which, from the Laureate's tale, one supposes
Is by a great deal the most charming of Noses.
There's only one thing that I cannot make out,
Among all these dodges for changing the snout,
1 fear lest it's proved a task over the strength
Of the maker to compass curtailing the length;
. ; «-• Though sincerely I trust,
As you know that I must
For the sake of your slightly elaborate snorter,
That it teaches a system for making them shorter;
"You cannot complain,
There's really no pain,
at first you won't like it, but try it again;
An hour a day,
It isn't much, eh!
For the sake of a beautiful nez retrousse";
From ten till eleven,
Six days in the seven.
Will give you the Nose of an angel of heaven.
That b to say, if it's true what authorities tell,
That those creatures require an organ of smell,
Though I shrewdly imagine, the bad ones who fell,
And were instantly turned out of heaven pell-mell,
And ever since then have resided in hell,
Would find on the whole they got on just as well
Without any feature which should them compel
To sniff up the savoury odour of—well,
A bouquet de roti au feu iternel.
And not quite the thing you would get from Kimvkl,
But I fear this digression
j" About the possession
Of Noses by those who went in for secession,
Has nothing to do with the matter in hand;
However it's written, and so let it stand.
Now, all that I say,
Is, don't lose a day,
But at once buy a sample of this Mr. Ross's
Inexpensive machine to put on your probocis;
And if by this plan
You find that you can
Turn your surplus of longitude into
some latitude,
shall think myself amply repaid by
your gratitude;
And all that I pray,
In return for the way
have shown you of easily changing
your nez,
Is that when to your fancy you've
moulded your cartilage,
You'll sometimes remember what I on
my part allege,
Which is this: there's no organ the
world can produce
Which combines the essentials of beauty
and use,
So well as that feature which grows on
your face,
And lends to your lineaments much of
their grace;
[We are quite sure our poetic Contributor means his advice well and kindly, but Mr.
Punch, being asked whether he will avail himBelf of it for hiB beautiful and unique no»e,
—" the noblest Roman of them all "—replies, with Quaker-like simplicity, " Net."—Rd.J
Thisorgan, whichdoctorshavechristened
"olfactory,"
Is at once a delight and a trusty phy-
lactery;
It's sometimes a pleasure and sometimes
a pain,
A benefit now, and now almost a bane.
It enjoys the perfume of a rose after rain,
And it warns you against an unsavoury
drain:
And it follows, de hinc,
It can trace every link
Between the sweet delicate scent of a
pink
And'a poisonous putrid monsoon of a
stink ■
And so I propose
My epistle to close
With this piece of advice—" Always
follow your Nose!"
THAMES BYE-LAWS.
The Conservators, as they are called, of the River Thames, anxious apparently
to prove their rightful claim to the title, have lately published a series of Bye-laws
for the regulation of that River.whieh said Bye-laws, instead of being received with
that respect and even gratitude that was probably expected, have been denounced
at various meetings, of a more or less public character, as not only unnecessary
but tyrannical, and even incomprehensible. Mr. Punch, therefore, being, as is
well known, tie recognised guardian of the rights of the Public to the free and
uninterrupted use of their own beautiful River, has directed his Boating Young
Man to peruse these same Bye-laws, which he has done with varied emotions;
astonishment, perhaps, being the predominant one. But there is one complaint
made by some unreasonable men in which he cannot participate. They are said to
be difficult to understand. Let him, then, test the accuracy of their statement,
and what does he find f Why the first sheet and a half are filled with explanations
of the meaning of the most ordinary words they use, so that no one need refer to a
Dictionary for a definition. For instance, a Person shall include any Body,
whether with a Corporation or not. How kind, too, of them to inform an astonished
world that a "Pleasure Vessel" means "a Vessel used for Pleasure!" and that
Pleasure Navigation does not mean Navigation for the conveyance of merchandise.
Perhaps a carping Angler or Boatman might sneeringly suggest that he knew
that before, but now many of either of those pleasure-seeking races could tell off-
hand, without a pause for deep reflection, the various meanings that these despotic
Conservators ordain that the word Vessel shall mean. Let them read and wonder.
"Vessel shall mean anyship, lighter, barge, launch, house-boat, boat, sailing-boat,
Sunt, wherry, randan, skiff, dingey, shallop, canoe, raft or craft." (sixteen
efinitions of one little word. What more could the most fastidious of Strokes or
the thickest of Skullers require P These Bye-laws, we are asked to believe, are to
facilitate the enjoyment of the Publio on their own River, so let us see what Bye-
law No 5 says, in this respect. "No person shall knowingly use, or assist, or be
concerned in using, or cause or suffer to be used upon the River Thames any vessel
for pleasure navigation, unless it be registered and marked as in these Bye-laws
provided," under a penalty of 40s. for the first offence, or £5 for the second, and
no person shall knowingly hire, or let for hire, or hold out for hiring, or offer for
hiring, or suffer to be let for hire, or permit to be let for hire for pleasure navigation
any vessel, unless as aforesaid, and under penalties as aforesaid. Can anything
be conceived more exquisitely ludicrous Y
Two or three young fellows from a City Office run down by train to Sunbury
or Hampton for a few hours' row on the beautiful River. They jump into a boat,
and away they go on their healthful and happy way, little knowing, poor fellows,
what fearful risk they run of heavy penalties. For unless they have previously
ascertained, in some way not explained, that the boat they are rowing in so
joyously has been registered and marked, as in these Bye-laws provided, each
of them will be liable to a penalty of forty shillings!
And what a wonderfully complex business this same registration is. The
owner must give his true name and residence, the number of vessels belonging
to him, the class to which each belongs, and each such vessel must have upon her
bow the owner's number, and under that the vessel's number, and those numbers
must be in black figures, two and a half inohes in length, and proportionately
thick, of a block (not blockhead) character, and shall be upon a white square,
of such a size as shall leave a clear margin of at least one inch in width outside
the numbers on every side thereof—and so on, with no less than eleven more
lines of similar twaddle devoted to this infinitesimally small subject. And even
this is not all, for the Conservators reserve to themselves the right to require the
marking of any vessel to be altered in any way they think proper, and at any
time. These regulations are but a sample of a series of Bye-laws for the Navi-
gation of the River Thames, which are perhaps unequalled for their uselessness,
their complexity, and the amount of annoyance they will cause to all who
delight in gaining health, strength, and enjoyment on our beautiful River.

Emily. "The Rooms are rather small, aren't they?"

"I SEE BEFORE ME A DIVIDED-SKIRT!"
A writer in the Figaro thus describes the divided skirt.—
"Jupe partagee consiste en un pantalon, sur lequel tombe jusqu'a la cheville,

Should Britannia, the Elder sister, agree with the Grand Old
Man-milliner, and think the divided skirt highly becoming, then, as
surely as fashions change, the elegant and graceful folds in the dress,
which are only a concession to Britannia's and Caledonia's ideas
of propriety, and of the fitness of things, will entirely disappear—

Mr. Timothy Heaxy—physically, Tiny Tim by the side of Mr.
Pabnell, though, morally, rather the opposite of Tiny Tim, who
was always for blessing everybody, and being uncommonly gushing
and sentimental—in the oourse of the Home Rule (first reading)
debate, said, "Whenever Rossa wanted a quotation or a oouplet
(against Ireland) he could always find one to his purpose in the
I'inies or Punch. We know of whom it is said he can always find,
even in Scripture, a quotation to his purpose, so we thank Tim for the
compliment, though O'Donovan Rossa won't \ and passing over the
unwarrantable familiarity on the part of Tiny Tim in speaking of our
worthy and revered Master as "Punch," without the prefix of
"Mr." we will say a word to Tim on the subject, and let us at once
put it dearly that Mr. Punch is not arguing, but instructing. As
Mr. McNeile Whistler observes, "Look here—I'm not arguing,
I'm telling you." Mr. Punch is the true friend of Ireland; not of
Orangemen or Ribandmen, or of Invinoibles, or Incorrigibles. He
is the true and sinoere friend of Distressful Hibebnia, the Cinderella
and Caledonia, and, as Buch, he has ere now
the deepest sympathy, represented her.
Mr. Punch (is not Punch an Irish name? And is there not
Punch's Town? Go to!) has no steel pen hard enough, and no
pencil black enough to represent the 'agrarian crimes, the Moon-
lighters, and the assassins, who are at once the terror and disgrace of
the country, nor can he, from time to time, exempt from his righteous
indignation those in authority who palliate such crimes, or who, by
their silence, appear to favour them, any more than he can too
strongly reprobate those on the other side who are willing to accept,
without careful examination, as true, and thereupon to promulgate,
any story which may keep at fever-heat the bad blood between the
two great factions into which the Irish people are divided.
And here Mr. Punch takes this opportunity of recording his admira-
tion of the Very Reverend Canon Ryan, P. P.t who, as reported
in last week's Tablet (and, as far as we are aware, in no other English
paper—Tiny Tim has reason to complain of the Times in such a
matter, but the Times can take care of itself, for in partisan cases
its charity begins at home, and stops there)—denounced, in the
strongest terms, the perpetrators'of an outrage committed on the
property of Captain George Dawson, of Ballinacourty, near Tip-
perary, "a kind and indulgent landlord," describing it as "wanton
ruffianism," and telling the people that such deeds as these " impeded
the progress of the country's independence," and were committed by
"base tools in the hands of the party that desired to perpetuate her
degradation and serfdom." Canon Ryan'8 speech, says the Tablet,
"was throughout warmly applauded," and the people voted'unani-
mously a resolution of sympathy with Captain Dawson, subscribing
on the spot £40, the Canon leading off with £15 of it, towards "a
reward for the speedy conviction of the perpetrators of this out-
rage." Bravo, Canon Ryan! O si sic omnes!

Further hints from the Powers that I am to draw in my horns.
Not if I know it. Private protest from Rosebery telling me that it
is really too had after all the consideration that has heen shown the
country, that I should go on blowing up the war-fever, and that if I
don't take care they '11 really he obliged to do something disagree-

afraid. Further act up to this by calling out all able-bodied men
not yet utilised between the ages of 16 and 67. Measure immensely
popular. Am received in fhe Assembly with an ovation. Tbicoupis
hooted by the Strangers' Gallery into the Lobby. Propose a loan of
100.000,000 francs for the purchase of ironclads and arms. Carried
without a division. Explain our defiant position to Europe and an-
nounce my intention of Btirring up a row at all hazards. Am cheered
to the echo, and carried home in triumph on President's shoulders.

Still stronger protests from the Powers. Point out that the atti-
tude I have taken up is suicidal. Send a stereotyped answer to all
six of them, telling them to "mind their own business." Think
that will wake them up. Hear from the Minister of Finance that
there is some difficulty in placing the loan at anything under
twenty-three per cent. lell him he may go to thirty-three, or to any
figure he likes, as long as he gets the money. Am informed by
Minister of Agriculture that there are nothing but old women and
children left to till the fields. Mention this in tho Assembly,
and it rouses them to enthusiasm. Point to the significant fact
that the whole nation is in arms, and only waiting the signal to
march on to Constantinople. Wonder to myself, seeing that we
have only 75,000 troops, all told, while the Turks have 300,000,
waiting to dispute the way with us on the frontiers, whether we
shall ever get there. Still, no harm in bluster. Reads well in the
papers, and hurts nobody. Talk of Thermopylae, and further rouse
the frenzy of the Assembly to boiling point. A fresh credit of
200,000,000 francs voted without a division, and I am again borne
home in triumph—this time on the shoulders of three ushers and
M. Tricoupis, who is forced by the majority to assist in carrying
me, against his will.

Ultimatum from the Powers. Threaten that if I won't listen to
reason they'll "let Turkey loose." Quite equal to them in my
reply. Answer, "Do it. The sooner the better." Put on a Field-
Marshal's uniform, and go round to the Departments. Hear at the
Ministry of War that the Army are out of boots and gunpowder.
Learn from the Admiralty that the Fleet has run short of engineers
and coals. Look in at the Treasury—not a drachma in it. Am
informed by the Minister of Commerce that, owing to the war-fever,
trade is paralysed, and everything at a stand-still. Talk of the
coming campaign, and keep up all their peckers. Dine well, and,
after dinner, send off a fresh defiant despatch to the Powers, telling
them "Greece does not intend to stand any more humbug from
Europe." Post it in a pillar-box, and then to bed, and dream of the
battle of Salamis.

the immediate abolition of the Primrose League.
From Lord R-nd-lph Ch-rch-ll.—Only too pleased. But really
must insist upon the immediate extermination of the Duke of
Arqyle.
From the Duke of 2?-rf/-rtf.—Quite so. But Covent Garden
Market must be alluded to in terms of unqualified admiration in the
speech from the Throne.
From Mr. T-hy (M.P. for B-rksh-re).—Perhaps. But Mud-
Salad Market must be denounced in the Queen's Speech.
And Mr. P-nch.—Not impossible, on condition that he holds in his
own person the offices of the entire Cabinet, and is authorised to
publish, in a daily edition of the London Gazette (profusely illus-
trated and sold at a penny), a list of the few people he admires and
the hundreds he justly holds in contempt.
SEASONABLE ARRIVALS.
(By a Chaffinch, a very old Bird.)
The Nightingales have come
For their usual time to stay;
Got o'er an April glum,
Be their dole a merry May.
Spare them, you East winds bitter,
So that music may ensue,
With a tootle twiddy twitter,
Jug, jug, jug, tootle too.
The weather will not suit
When the wind is blowing wrong.
Then the Nightingale is mute
Like a Queen of Opera song,
Having taken such a chill,
That her eye bedimmed o'erflows,
And a shade of pink sits ill
On the summit of her nose.
Here comes the Cuckoo too,
Very oft a bird o'erbold,
Being apt, as well as you
And me, to catch a cold.
But he takes a wayward course,
For he will attempt to sing,
And you hear that he is hoarse
In the grove or on the wing.
The Swallow hither flies
A mate intent to take,
They pair, but two, the Wise
Say, don't a summer make.
So augury we defy,
Whatever may befall,
From swallows found my eye
And Betty Martin all.
Easter Toy and Sweet-" Shop Egos." — Mr. Punch begs to
acknowledge a basket of Easter Eggs, laid at his door, the manu-
facture of which is to be laid at the door of Mr. Cremer Junior.
Wonderful! Glass eggs holding ornaments for a Doll's House, egfjs
with political figures breaking out of the shell and delivering their
Slans ab ovo. Then a Hi-diddle-diddle egg, with a cat playing the
ddle, just what Alice would see on Hennybody's breakfast-table in
Wonderland. Certainly for Toy-shop eggs the young ones may
write in old French, to Mr. Cremer Junior (of course ne's junior)
and say "d Toy toujours!"
Then, for the Sweet-shop Eggs at Easter, commend us to the hens
which Messrs. Sparagnapane evidently feed on sweetmeats. The
eggs are full of the most delicious nicies, and are as ingeniously
contrived for holding "sweets" as are the small chicks in any
family. When any one child has eaten an eggful, as is as full as an
egg, the judicious mother will say, in the best modern Anglo-
French, " Un ceuf is as good as a feast."
Resignation of Sir Thomas Erskine May.
In April of yore the Commons would say,
"All hail to your rain! surely coming is May!"
But now cry the Commons, in desolate tone,
"Here's April not over, and May, alas! gone!"
"It comes like a Boon !"—Worth any hundred modern Novels,
and most old ones. Thackeray's Vanity Fair. Immortal. Messrs.
Smith, Elder & Co. are bringing out a pocket edition in two volumes.
As the, illustrations (except here and there a Dicky-Doyle-like
vignette, were merely curiosities, the book will be all the better
without them, as though no one could equal Thackeray in his
delineation of character with his pen, he was an utter failure when
depicting them with his pencil.

III.—To "CHRISTOPHER NORTH."
0 Christopher, with eagle eye
Fired on the water swirling,
You'd watch the predatory fly,
Before the troutlet curling:.
In "sporting jacket," on the hill
You braved the winter weather:
You loved the ripples of the rill,
The purple of the heather.
With flashing glance, with "front of Jove,"
We saw you in your classes;
In "Maga's" Tory page you strove
'Gainst Cockneys, Whigs, and asses.
In sooth you made a pretty stir,
Though Southrons scarcely know it;
Professor and philosopher,
An athlete and a poet.
Nor can we praise them overmuch,
Those wit-illumined pages,
Where Tickler speaks, Kit waves his crutch,
And Hogg lives for all ages.
How swift the flowing fancies come,
We count him but a zany,
Who loves not that Symposium,
"Noctet Ambrosiance/'
A critic, with the strength of ten,
None shows in fairer fashion,
How Homer thrills the minds of men
With living fire and passion.
Now London bards are on your list,
Hunt 's dubbed a scurvy fellow;
Anon smart Jeffrey feels the fist
That pounds " the Blue-and-Yellow."
The motto of our modern times
Is careless toleration;
We laugh at literary crimes,
And ban with moderation.
Great Christopher, your greater heart
Beat fiercely, ours grow weaker;
Yet here's a bumper ere we part,
No heel-taps—brim the beaker!

Lord Randolph Churchill. — Duty on
Home-made Ulsters and Orange Marmalade.
Mr. Bradlauah.—Ditto on owners of Un-
cultivated Land.
Lord Rayleigh.—Tax, in interest of Electric
Lighting Companies, on Gas Consumers.
Mr. Chamberlain.—Ditto on Dames and
Knights Harbinger of the Primrose League;
especially on those Habitations that persist in
perpetuating his association with the legend
of Three Aores and a Cow."
Mr. Labouchere. — Ditto on Hereditary
Members of the House of Lords.
Mr. Gladstone.—Ditto on old Whigs, loiter-

not prepared, come what will, come what

An Objection to Orangemen.—They are

A BUCOLIC BALLADE.
"This, according to my recollection, in the old
days was a general practice in the parish of Bolton
Percy, and it has left upon my mind a pleasant
memory of the comfort and independence of the
peasantry in the village life of my youth."—Sir W.
Harcourt, in a Letter to " Tht Timet."

Ye come to me once more,
And once again my fancy strays
Among ye as of yore.
Again I see the plot of grass.
Sufficient for a cow.
Fond dream! from which I wake, alas!
To ask, "Where is it now?"
Ah! times have changed, and so have men.
Things are not now as they were then!
Gone! gone the tale of home content
Told round the cottage fire!
Gone, too, the modest acre's rent,
And gone the good old Squire.
For gentle breeding years nave killed,
And courtesy lies dead,
Sir William's gracious place being filled
By somebody called "Fred."

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, April 12.—House crowded
again in every part. Royalty in the Galleries, and Members huddled
together in the Gangways. Members generally breakfasted at home,
but large numbers lunched in House. At Three o'Clock hats on every
seat. Only man above suspicion is Eccleston Gibb. Generally
admitted that there is only one hat of that kind made. If he's seen
in Lobby wearing it pretty certain he can't have another one on the
Bench. Speaker, further pressed, distinctly lays down law that
Members possessing two hats securing seat with one, and leaving
Palace Yard under other, lose all claim to seat. Mitchell Henry
wants to settle matter by building new House.
"Better wait and see whether Irish Members stay with us," said
Sir Bobebt Fowler, shrewdly. "If they go to Dublin there'll be
plenty of room." _
Nothing so curious as sudden birth of regret at prospect of losing
Joseph Gnus, Tim Healt and the rest. Was a time when it seemed
that Home Rule scheme would be carried without debate, simply
because it would clear the House of Irish Members. Now, when boon
offered, sternly declined. Success of Bill actually threatened on this
particular ground. Burt would heartily support it, but could not
stand this stipulation. Bradlaugh took same line. Could scarcely
control his voice when he referred to his hon. friends opposite. They
had howled at him, voted against him, done their best and their
worst to keep him out of the House. But the prospect of their being
permanently banished was unbearable.
Speech of the evening from Major Saunderson. Came down
heavy on Pakxei.l in respect of his differing manner when address-
ing the House of Commons and when orating to mass meeting in
Ireland. "If you want to see Norval at his best," said the Major,
"you must go to the Grampian Hills; and if you want to see the
modern Irish patriot at his Dest, you must see him when he stamps
on his native bog." All very well to talk about Roumelia. "But
she was man enough to take her stand," whereas Ireland was not
strong enough to be free.
Business done.—Adjourned Debate on Home Rule Bill.
Tuesday.—Gosches' very angry with Harcourt, who has been
making jokes. Not a weakness Goschen himself subject to, and will
not have it in others. Only fair to Harcourt to say that he was not
jocund all through his speech. The first half-hour enlivened by

impromptus presenting themselves with great regularity upon his
notes. After this, became serious, not to say funereal. In my
opinion," said Bolton, "and I submit the
opinion with deference—Harcourt would
have been twice as effective if his speech
had been half as long."
Goschen himself went for the Bill ham-
mer and tongs; spoke amid continuous
cheers from the Conservatives. De Cobain
hasn't asked any questions since he put one
down on the 1st April. But to-night made
little speech, which testified to extreme
depression of spirits. Hicks-Beach equally
heavy. On the whole, a dull night, till,
just on stroke of Twelve, Gladstone rose.
House, which had emptied under effects of
Hicks-Beach's oratory, rapidly filled up.
Gladstone spoke for an hour, full of (ire
and vigour, voice apparently improved by
great feat of Thursday night. Nothing
more to bo said when he sat down. So
leave to bring in Bill granted, amid vocife-
rous cheering.
Business done.—Home Rule Bill read
First Time.
Wednesday.—Amid the clang of party
combat, the creation of coalitions, and the

A dull day in the Commons,

interesting speech in support of Bill deal-
ing with uncultivated lands. Described
how these things were arranged in China.
Law there that everyone holding culti-
vatable lands in an uncultivated state
shall be imprisoned, and the land taken

its full value, the proprietor flogged.

stood in the Lobby, whither he had fled
after twenty minutes of this, "that is

Business done.—None.

House listened with pained regret to the reading of the brief letter

Members called to mind
that there

houses of less than £8 rental, we can brew beer without a. licence,
and that's something.
Business done.—Budget brought.in.
Friday.—Once more a crowded House, and
expectation centred on Gladstone. Speaker
won't hear of chairs again; and Alderman
Fowler, who last week sat on a chair in the
centre of the floor, adding grace and dignity
to the proceedings, now startled the House by
addressing the Speaker from back seat in the
6ide Gallery. Old Ministers, new Ministers,
and ex-Ministers, all in their places. Tre-
velyan seated by himself in corner of fourth
Bench below the Gangway. Chamberlain in
Bright's corner seat, with Bright for com-
panion. Habtlngton and James seated to-
gether immediately behind Treasury Bench;
Goschen in corner seat just behind.
Gladstone evidently conscious throughout
speech of this interesting section of hisaudience.
Turns round from time to time to address
them personally. More especially
turns to Chamberlain, who sits
with ears pricked up, listening' to
Premier's description of a Bill
greatly altered since he first made
its acquaintance, and quitted the
Cabinet. A dramatic scene, if we
come to think of all it means beyond
the somewhat prosaic exposition of
a Land Bill.
Chamberlain followed in clever
speech, and with plainly conciliatory
manner. "Seems to me," said
that they '11 get Chamberlain back. Don't remember,

Business done.—Irish Land Bill read First Time.

Court being cleared of all women before I commence my summing-
up." No excuse admitted, no women admitted. Out you go, Ladies,

"Vllo, Jones! You in Paris!"

THE CINDERELLA OF THE AKTS.
{A Slory told after Dinner.)
There were once three sisters, called respectively Paintinga,
Musicana, and Dramatica, and they lived together on terms of not
entire amity. Paintinga and Musicana were very proud—one had
a fine House near the Burlington Arcade, where once a year she
entertained the greatest of the land, and the other boasted the admi-
ration of a Naval Royalty, who played the fiddle and once composed
a Waltz. Dramatica had neither of these advantages, and had to
satisfy herself with merely being infinitely richer than her sisters, and
altogether better off. So, whole Paintinga and Musicana were
dining, and listening to the more or less sweet sounds of an illustrious
violinist, poor Dramatica stayed at home amongst the wealthy and
great.
One day, when the latter, as usual, was lamenting her fate—so
different from her sisters—her Fairy Godfather suddenly appeared
before her.
"I am not surprised that you should be sorrowful," he observed,
passing his hand through his long iron-grey hair, and fixing his pince-
nez on nisnose, "for you are indeed unfortunate."
"Am I not?" said Dramatica, casting lrom her some ducal in-
vitations that had been sent to amuse her—poor thing, she had few
playthings. "Am I not, indeed?"
It is a pity that you are not able to tako a degree at Oxford and
Cambridge," continued the Fairy, "or at any rate, write R.A. after
your name."
"I should like to do that very much—I was always fond of the
Royal Artillery," almost sobbed the poor child (she was much younger
than her sisters, being scarcely three thousand years old), and thus
showing her naivete.
"I meant the Royal Academy," returned tho Fairy Godfather,
with an amused smile; "not that the Royal Academy of Music goes
for much."
"No, it does not," said Dramatica, decisively; "especially since
the'Royal College of Music took the wind out of its sails."
"Poor thing!" sighed the Fairy. "What shall I do for you?"
"I am sure I don't know. You are aware that I have a number
of connections always out of an engagement. Couldn't you help
them?"
The Fairy considered for a moment, and then replied,—
"Well, I would if I could. But you see, my dear, that the com-
pany at my Theatre is complete. 1 am afraid I couldn't promise
them an engagement."
"That is very sad, for I am sure they are full of talent. Couldn't
you get other dairies with theatres like yourself to assist them P
"That I would, indeed," replied the Godfather, earnestly; "and
if anything I could say would influence them, I would utter it. But
you see the other Fairies with Theatres, like myself, seem to be in a
similar predicament."
Poor Dramatica burst into tears, and her Godfather was grieved
to the heart.
"What is to become of them all?" she moaned—"the Leading
Man, the First Old Woman, the Singing Chambermaid, and the
Walking Gentleman? Can't you help them?"
"I have it!" cried the Fairy at last, triumphantly. "Although
I and my brother Fairies like to keep our stages to our own tried
companies, there is no reason why the State should not help the
others. Had I my way, there should be a Grand National Theatre—
say sixty miles from London, because the Government would have
no right to interfere with vested interests by organising a public-
purse-paid opposition—and in this Grand National Theatre all the
unacting should have their chance."
"But who would go to see them?" asked Dramatica, smiling
through her tears.
"I nave nothing to do with that," replied the Fairy; "but, con-
sidering that lunatics and paupers are under Government control,
there should be no serious difficulty in arranging for an audience."
"That would be very nice, indeed," said Dramatica. "And
now, my dear friend, why did you call me the ' Cinderella of the
Arts' Pfi
The Fairy smiled, and wiped his pince-nez. "Well," he began,
smilingly, I am not quite sure when I used the expression that I
quite understood my own meaning. You see it was a charity dinner."
"That is scarcely an answer," replied Dramatica. "Can't you
(as the lawyers say) contrive to mend it? I repeat, why did you call
me Cinderella i"
"That is decidedly a conundrum," replied the Fairy Godfather,
after careful consideration.
And when that conundrum is solved, this story shall be continued.
THE .MEG^RAS OF TO-DAY.
[Mr. Justice Wills commented very severely on the presence and
behaviour of the women in Court during the trial of Mrs. Bartlett.]
Not women surely these who go to gloat
Upon a woman in her agony;
To watch the ebb and flow of hope, to note
Whether the law shall doom her or set free.
Wo know a page that stains French histories;
How women knitted while tho guillotine
Did its fell work before their cruel eyes;
And sighed to think such things could e'er have been.
But now in England of to-day, the Court
That tries a hapless woman for her life,
Is crammed with sister-women, and their sport
Is watching twists and turns of legal strife,
As the net closes round her. How they smile,
Those fashionable dames; men hold their breath
In silence, while girls chatter; for the while
A woman hovers between life and death.
Look at her well, and poise the smart lorgnette,
The theatre can show no braver sight;
And murmur in light-hearted phrases, yet
Methinks her face is growing ghastly white.
Women, they tell us, in Imperial Rome,
Were fiercest for the gladiator's blooa;
And lo! we have their congeners at home—
A foul disgrace to English womanhood!
The Great Soapists have bought Sir John Millais' picture of a
child blowing bubbles for £2,200. Big price. Sir John will hence-
forth be known as Sir "Bubbley-Jock" Mtllais.

In the liquid, throaty accents of his dear old native land;
Though I really fail to see what right the Commons have to squelch

JIM THE PEN-VIPER.
In marrying Jim the Penman, Nina, who proved herself a Ninny,
took a viper, a pen-viper, to her bosom. Jim the Penman, the play
at the Haymarket, is written by Sir Charles Young, to whom,
adapting Old Wardle's address to Tupman, I would say,—" The
best shot in existence could not have done it more beautifully.
You are an older hand
at this than I thought
you, Young; you have
done this sort of thing
before." Mr. Tupman
brought down a bird,
and Sir Charles has
brought down houses.
Mr. Tupman's success
was pure chance, Sir
Chahles's is thoroughly
well deserved.
It would be difficult
to find an actress who
so thoroughly enters into
the part, and, for the
time being, is so com-
Act I.-" Let me sign the cheque for you my letel the character she
dear. You are close at hand and could do it f representing, as Lady
yourself, but then what would become of the _frfL ~~i
situation in the Third Act ? » Monckton. She appears
to be utterly indifferent
to her audience, and, so far, her performance of Mrs. Ralston, from
first to last, is the perfection of the actor's art. How such an artist
could fall into the one error in the acting of this play,—vide the
Illustration, Act IV.—I do not understand: and how it happened
that the author, after seeing its first performance at a matinee,
missed the great opportunity afforded him < f a grand situation, in the
same Act, which Lady Monckton could have carried through
triumphantly,—where one line would have had a hundred times the
effect of the present more or less theatrical scene, is a puzzle to me.
That Lady Monckton can, in a critical but most dramatic situa-
tion, hold her audience—a crowded mixed audience—spell-bound,
for what seems minutes, without uttering a single word, is a great
tribute to her power, and to the constructive ability of the author.
If Lady Monckton cannot always play up to her present high
level, I hope that she will not allow herself to be persuaded into
attempting anything that she does not thoroughly feel. Being above
the necessities of the profession, she has only to consider the require-
ments of the histrionic art.
Mr. Dacre may be a universal genius, but he has invariably been a
one-sided, or rather, a lop-sided actor. He is always aslant, like a tree
on the coast that has been forced out of the perpendicular by continual
violent gales. Perhaps, however, it coincides with the fitness of things
that Jim the Penman, who is morally out of the perpendicular, should
be represented by Mr. Dacre, who can't go straight; but, on
the other hand, he plays thoroughly, and is heart and soul in the
part, though he
mars some of his sjS^t At*-?* \ '-\ 1 I -
through a habit of
starting off for a
short sharp walk
on every possible
occasion, when he
is brought up
sharply by the
proscenium. But
again, for a forger
to be represented
by a champion
pedestrian, who is
always "forging
ahead," may be
taken as symbol-
ism in action. Act I.—The Two Villains (to each ot/ur). "Now we
Seriously Mr! are alone, and as there couldn't possibly be any one in
Dacre's' James conservatory, let us shout out our secrets, which, if
Ralston except over'lear<1, would condemn us to penal servitude."
for such mannerisms, is really very good. His make-up is too
youthful; as also is that of Mr. Barrtmore, who is the only actor
whose performance is Btagey. He says "butter" for "better"
and "dhont" for "don't, attitudinises, works his eyes and eye-
brows, and seems desirous of conveying to the audience generally,
that he is condescending to a part which is not up to his own
idea of his own capabilities, ana that a "time will come," when
they will see him with his mouth full of old-fashioned blank
verse, possibly as the husband of Mrs. Haller (I think Mr. Holier
talked blank verse; at all events, it always sounded like it) in that

eminently lively play, The Stranger, which ought to be played every
Fifth of November, with a chorus of " Haller, Doys, Haller! Here's
another Guy!"
Young Oeorge (Mr. Frank Rodney^ is excellent: a very good boy,
and deserves to be at the
top of the class. Agnes
(Miss Helen Leyton), good
girl, but, for an ingenue, she
seems to know just a little
too much. Lord Drelin-
court behaves in a most
high-minded and gentle-
manly manner as a charac-
ter, and is ably represented
by Mr. Edmund Maurice,
who looks a gentleman,
and "acts as sich." The
men's parts are all well
played: though perhaps

ally a little out of the

unpleasant, hut not un
familiar, type of fashion
able lady, bhe has two or
three good things to say. Only by a close analysis of the plot can
her exact value as an artistic accessory be estimated.
Sir Charles offends against a canon of dramatic art by not letting
the audience into the secrets of his plot on the earliest possible
,, opportunity; and so, though
y'^iS) we are not very long in
Ay' ffl suspense as to the identity of
vl J"n the Penman with James
Ralston, none of us are quite
certain as to the raison d etre
of the sleepy Captain Red-
wood, who is presumably an
officer, but, if so, it is a
Sheriff's Officer of the Hebrew
Army. "The repose of Mr.
Brooktteld's method," to use
the modern dramatic critic's
shibboleth, iB, like his nose, a
distinctive feature of the part.

We know the Detective is about Bome- (at least, that is the idea,
where—so let us shout out to one another though these are not precisely
all the secrets which will make our penal the words),—on which situa-
servitude a certainty." tion the curtain falls,-the
author has given us the best surprise I have experienced since the
first night that Horace Wig an started up from a table, where he
had feigned sleep, and throwing off his navvy's comforter and cap,
in answer to Who the deuce are you? exclaimed, "Hawk-
shaw! the Detec-
tive !!"—chord, and
"scene closed in."
As for Mr. Beer-
bohm Tree, I have
never seen him better
than as Baron Hart-
fildt. His make-up
is perfect, and the
manner is equal to the
make-up. Hitherto,
it has always seemed
to me, that his fault
has been over-elabo-
ration, which passing
the boundary of com-
edy, trespasses on the
domain of burlesque. Act IV.—Mrs. Ralston to James Ralston. "There

His "Ain't it?" whether due to himself or to the author, is, as
given, a touch of natural mannerism most thoroughly characteristic.
But tor* the error of shouting his secrets, into which all the prin-
cipals without exception fall (though once I noticed Mr. Tree's

So much for the actors, and one word more for the author. The

jent of everybody perpetually overhearing everybody else is
and it may occur to some of us that the devices for eaves-
dropping might have been better contrived; yet I am bound
to say that the means employed, hackneyed though they be,

roughly well-acted play as this,—a play which is entirely free from
all risky situations and unwholesome suggestiveness; a play re-
markable for the entire absence of sentimental gush and clap-trap
platitudes, which enlists our sympathies for nobility of motive, for
suffering and self-sacrifice, and powerfully exhibits the meanness
of crime, the misery of its perpetrators, and the severity of its just
punishment. It is the best drama of its kind since Tom Taylor's

THAMES BYE-LAWS.
(An Explanation.)
Mb. Punch, Sib,
I am informed on such authority as I cannot for a moment
doubt, that the Conservators of the River Thames are not themselves
responsible for the extraordinary code of Bye-Laws they have just
issued, but that the whole and sole authority for them is the com-
bined wisdom of the two Houses of Parliament, whose haughty man-
date they are compelled to obey, and whose scaroely intelligible
gibberish they are ordered to endeavour to translate into compre-
hensible language. Under these circumstances kindly allow me to
put the saddle on the right horse; or rather, perhaps, I ought to say,
the skulls in the right boat, as no one, Sir, educated in your noble
school can ever be ashamed to confess an unintentional error.

AN EASTER SONG
HEARD in the ha WARDEN WOODS.
Away from the wrack and the riot and flare,
And away from the peril and pother,
I've come; yet my mind is a prey to black care,
And I'm harassed by bother on bother.
Each hour brings some phantom to break my repose,
P'raps it's Rylands to-day, Bright to-morrow,
Or Chamberlain, Hartington !—who would suppose
Their names would in me stir such sorrow!
But, let come will what may, I must trick and contrive it,
That, by hook or by crook, I may somehow survive it.
I've modified this, and I 'ye cut away that,
In the hope I should suit their good pleasure,
Till Paenell looks glum and inquires what I'm at—
Almost asks what I've left of the measure.
I '11 let them at Westminster still keep their seats,
And I '11 cut off their right of excise too;
It's just by attempting such possible feats
That one—well, keeps one's hand in, or tries to.
So, let come will what may, I can trick and contrive it,
That, by hook or by crook, I shall somehow survive it.
Those millions? To buy out the landlords, I vowed
That they wanted a hundred and twenty.
When they howled at the sum, quite promptly I bowed,
And discovered that fifty was plenty.
There's nothing that I will not alter or shape,
Or regard as important or weighty.
To get myself out of this horrible scrape,
And diminish that fast growing Eighty.
So, let come will what may, I must trick and contrive it;
For, by hook or by crook,—yes, I mean to survive it!
Where does Mr. Roberts, the Champion Billiard Player, spend his
Easter Holiday? Why in Kew Gardens, of course: that's where he
takes his rest. Here, by recent permission of " Dr. Hookah," smok-
ing is permitted.

THE GRAND OLD FALCONER.
Air—" Philip the Falconer."
Old William the Falconer's up with the day,
With his falcons on his frame:
And o'er Erin's meadows is wending his way,
To hawk at the old, eld game.
William is clever, if not very young,
And William, they say, has a wonderful tongue;
But William's pet peregrine, feeling some scare,
Has slipped off its hood and is off through the air.
Will vows and declares, believe it or not,
He would rather have lost any bird of the lot.
But falcons, they say,
To fly true to their prey,
Require the most skilful of training.
The Falconer feels he that hawk must secure,
'Tis so potent in pinion and bill;
So the Falconer pauses to pull out his lure,
And waves it about with a will.
But the falcon seems tired of a hooded hawk's life,
And he's off down the wind with a wing like a knife.
And vain seems the whistle and vain seems the wile;
He is hardly a bird to be lured in that style.
Oh, when he returns from hawking, I guess,
Old William may find he's a falcon the less.
But falcons who stray,
And fly wide of the prey,
Are scarce worth the trouble of training.

"THE HAUNTED MAN."
A Legend of the Day.
He was sick to death of it. His poor brain was weary with the
weight of it, and he felt that if he could not escape from it he must
surely pass away. And it was sad, for he was young and brave, and
(as the world goes) in easy circumstances.
"What shall I do? What shall I do?" he murmured to himself.
"Ah! a visit to my Club! There I shall escape it."
So he hurried to the smoking-room of the Kemble, that most cele-
brated chamber of wits and aristocrats, and seated himself in an
arm-chair.
"The Boat-Race was well contested," he began, rather nervously.
"At Barnes Bridge there seemed to be no doubt about Oxford pulling
it off."
"Quite so," assented the member to whom he had addressed him-
self. "It was a complete surprise to thousands that Cambridge
should have got home first. And talking of home reminds me
But before the sentence could be finished he had hurriedly risen
and fled. The smoking-room of the Kemble was not sacred. It had
got in there as it had got in elsewhere. But he would give the Clubs
one more chance—he would call at the Junior United Sword and
Bayonet. This time he seated himself in the coffee-room, and par-
took of lunch. An old field-officer was seated next him.
"Delighted to meet you again," he observed, cheerily. "Thought
you were in Egypt."
"So I was, replied the warrior, cordially. "We got rather
tired of the work at Suakim, and were precious glad, I can tell you,
to get home. And, speaking of home"
He heard no more. Leaving his scarcely tasted luncheon on the
table, he withdrew. Not even the Junior United Sword and Bayonet
Club was safe from it! It had got in there!
What should he do? Why not try Society? Dinner-parties and
dances were open to him. So he got himself invite^ to the house of
a very wealthy man. And he was asked to " take down" a gushing
young person in pink. For the first three or four courses he expe-
rienced a sense of relief. The gushing young person in pink was
entirely educated—she had passed through Girton.
"And I Buppose you study the classics?" he queried, smiling,
for the dinner was particularly good, and he was well contented.
"To be sure," replied the gushing young person in pink. "I
think Homer too lovely. And, talking of Homer, reminds me—
what do you think of"
But he did not wait to hear the rest of the story. Under the
pretext of sadden and severe indisposition, he rushed away.
The next evening he was enjoying a "square" at a Ball. He
had chosen "the Lancers," as that dance afforded less opportunity
for conversation than any other. But, between the figures, he was
f oroed to speak.
"Are you not glad that hydrophobia seems to be dying out?" he
asked, in one of the customary pauses.
"Oh, so glad!" replied his partner. "What with the Muzzles,
and the Home for Lost Dogs, it soon should disappear altogether.
And, talking of the Home for lost Dogs, what do you think"
He knew what was coming, and, in spite of etiquette, fled as if an
avalanche were after him.
And then he tried Low Sooiety. He visited the Bar of the Public-
House, the Pit of the City Theatre, the Stalls of the East-End Music
Halls. But it was all the same. He was haunted!
"And there are thousands like me in this miserable city!" he
exclaimed, as, tired out, he seated himself in the Regent's Park.
He was too fatigued to move. Presently two beggars seated
themselves apologetically beside him. At first their conversation
was held in whispers, but later on they became more animated, and,
as they warmed to their subject—oh, horror! But he could not
protest—he could not move. He was at their mercy. The
shadow, from which that Haunted Man had been trying so
strenuously to escape, was again upon him!
Even the beggars were discussing Home Rule!

LAW AND LUNACY.
Sensibility. You see our excellent Lord Chancellor himself amended the new Lunacy
Bill on the lines you yourself suggested.
Sense. Certainly; and so far as vested interests are concerned, they seem now to be very
well guarded. But, my dear British Public, as you have taken the Lunacy Laws in hand,
do you not think you could go a little further? Do you know how a man gets into a
Public Asylum as a patient P
Sensibility. Well, not exactly. I suppose for good and sufficient reasons.
Sense. A pauper who is once declared to be mad is not a person whose position seems
exactly calculated to attract much subsequent attention. But, first, did it not appear to you
strange that (according to the debate in the House of Lords) the cures are known to be fai
greater at Private Asylums than at Publio Institutions P
Sensibility. Oh, yes; but that is accounted for by patients being transferred from one
Asylum to another.
Sense. Not entirely; for if it is thought desirable to remove a patient from a Private
Asylum at all, it appears probable that the move would be completely oarried out, and those
Institutions would lose him altogether. And does it not seem reasonable to imagine that the
cures at a Public Asylum, where the inmates are placed without half the safeguards adopted
to prevent improper detention at a Private Asylum, and where, consequently, mistakes may
occasionally be made (especially when the "lunatic " is a chronic inebriate) of incarcerating
sane people amongst the insane, should at least be equal to those of a " Licensed House,
particularly if everybody is so anxious to keep the patient in the latter Institution for the
sake of gain?
Sensibility. Well, certainly, it does seem a plausible suggestion.
Sense. And if I tell you that there are actually thousands (mind you, thousands in the
plural) of patients incarcerated in a single Public Asylum, under the medical charge of a Super-
intendent, with either one assistant, or at most a couple, to help him in his duties, do you
think that all these thousands of poor "lunatics" (excluding malingerers" who may use
the place for their own convenience, living at the ratepayers' expense) have a fair chance of
proving their initial sanity: or even, with so little medical supervision, of getting anyone to
recognise their change for the better on becoming cured?
Sensibility. Well, at the first blush it does seem a little difficult; but they can always appeal
to the Justices?
Sense. Who pay visits of two hours' duration a few times a year, the greater part of
which is most probably employed in their Committee-Room. Do you think it is likely that
the Superintendent can be "up" in
individual case of those thousands, or the
Visitors, if he is " up" in it, have time to
inquire into the merits of every particular
incarceration?
Sensibility. Well, really — but you see,
Public Asylums are conducted without a
view to gam, and consequently

lucky manner which would not be tolerated

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A PRIMROSE DAME.
Sketched by Our Artist in Covent Garden, April 19.
AMATEUR WORK.
By a New Hand,
I have already described with what success I essayed the part of acting as my own Paper-
hanger and my own Chimney-sweep; and now, owing to an attempt to serve as my own
Plumber, I have found myself called upon, by a natural sequence of events, to discharge the
duties of my own Dentist. The details are very simple.
Wishing to arrange some irregularities of an upper cistern, I somehow contrived, by inju-
diciously removing a foot of the supply-pipe at, I fancy, the wrong place, to divert the con-
tinuous service inside the house for thirteen hours and a half; flooding the stairs and landings
with a complete cataract, and turning the whole of the premises from top to bottom, for the
time being, into a vigorous and unceasing shower-bath. Happening to have an invalid Uncle
staying on a visit with me, who would come out to see what was the matter, the damp flew to
his face, with the result of giving him a violent toothache. He talked of "having it out,"
upon which I at once volunteered my services, assuring him that I felt quite equal to acting,
on an emergency, as " my own family Dentist"; and, after a little pressure, he cheerfully
consented to plaoe himself in my hands.
Thus came about my experience, which, as it is instructive, and may serve as a useful
guide to others who wish to conduct the operation of tooth-extraction at home, without the
intervention of the professional Middleman, I will furnish from my rough notes, jotted down
off-hand during the progress of the proceedings.
Having agreed to take out my invalid Uncle's tooth, prepare to arrange
room suitably, and look out fitting instruments. After hunting well all over the
house for the iatter, manage to secure a fair collection, consisting of a stout pair
of carpenter's pincers, a pair of nutcrackers, curling-tongs, lever-corkscrew,
carving-fork, and piece of bell-wire, which I fancy will be sufficient. Fasten
the foot-stool to the back of the study arm-chair to make a head-rest, and place
it opposite the window, and, all being ready, ask my Uncle to take his seat. He
does so, and opens his mouth. I ask him which is the tooth. He says he
doesn't know, but thinks it is the third from the back at the bottom. I take
up the carpenter's pincers, but tell him it is better to make sure, and, as the boy
from the Chemist's nappens to be calling with some medicine at that moment, I
propose to call him in, and have his opinion. My Uncle nods. Boy comes in.
Questioned, he says he can't tell which tooth it is, but that if I take three out
I'm pretty sure to have the right one. He adds that he has always seen that
dono at the surgery. Put this to my Uncle. He says I had better, at any
rate, begin at something. Determine that I will, and endeavour to fasten on
the third tooth at the bottom with the carpenter's pincers. Fancy I have got it
all right. Give a wrench, and my Uncle comes out of the chair. I let go. He
says he doesn't think I had got hold of the right one, and, at any rate, he can't
keep his head steady when I pull. Suggest that I shall send up and ask the
man who is tuning the piano in the drawing-room, if "he '11 mind just stepping
down for a moment and holding it."
Pianoforte Tuner appears, and we try again. Result no better. This time
I pull my Uncle with the chair, and the Pianoforte Tuner holding on to the back
go. The Pianoforte Tuner suggests that it
isn't strength that is wanted but " knack."
He says it s all done by the wrist, and that
he has heard that savages can take out their
own teeth with the greatest ease. Remem-
ber that a Retired South-African Mission-
ary lives round the corner, and send a line
begging him "j u st to step in for a moment.''
He comes. Explain the situation. He says
that the natives with whom he had to deal
used to whip their teeth oat with a scalping-
knife, but that this was a sort of religious
rite that he does not think I could safelv
practise on my Uncle, and that he should
advise a piece of string and pulley, which,
when nine thousand miles away from a
Dentist, he used to have recourse to himself.
Thank him for his advice. Send for ball of
twine, fasten it with bell-wire to my Uncle's
tooth, and pass it over the curtain-pole.
Pull hard. My Uncle raised some way out
of his chair, but no use. String breaks.
Chemist's Boy asks why I don't try the
nutcrackers." I do, but can't get a good
purchase with them. Offer them to the
Pianoforte Tuner, who also tries and fails.
Retired South-African Missionary and
Chemist's Boy both have a turn, but with
no better result. My Uncle says I had
better fall back upon the pincers, and that
he thinks I did loosen something " with
them. Take them up again, and determine
to see if I cannot manage a little "knack"
with the wrist this time. Fix firmlv, I
think, on the right tooth, the Pianoforte
Tuner and Chemist's Boy holding my Uncle
tightly back, while the Retired South-
African Missionary throws his weight on to
my side. The Pianoforte Tuner says that
when we pull a chorus would help us. He
leads as with:—" Yeo ho ! boys. Teo oh!"
We all join in this, and at each line give
a prolonged tug at my Unele. Certainly the
tooth moves. I warm to my work. Yes, I
feel it giving! "Now then, once more, all
together—Yeo ho! boys!" I fall back-
wards on to the floor with the Retired South-
Afrioan Missionary, and my Uncle and the
chair go over in the opposite direction in a
heap with the Pianoforte Tunerand Chemist's
Boy. But the tooth is out!
I must, however, add, in justice to those
who are disposed to follow in my footsteps,
that though the tooth was extracted, it was,
unfortunately, not the right one. That was
eventually removed at the Dental Hospital.
But I would not discourage the Amateur
Dentist. He only requires decision in hand-
ling, and knack in execution. The last he
could attain, I should say, by practising
pulling out carpet-nails.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

''ET TU, BRIGHTE!"
PUNCH TO THE NEW AUSTRALIAN ELEVEN.
Nine good bowlers and ten good bats,
Eleven fielders all active as cats,
Game everyone to catch anything catchable,
Two wicket-keepers both simply unmatohable!—
That is a team that should give us some trouble,
And keep all our cricketing cracks at the double.
Our home willow-wielders must play up like bricks
To collar that bowling, to tumble those sticks.
Well, welcome, boys, anyhow! You '11 pull together.
Here's wishing you fortune, fair field, and fine weather.
We 're looking for many a score-piling day,
And win, lose, or tie, not one wrangle! Hooray!
Writ in Error.—The Parisian Art-Reviewist of the
Times, in his notice of the Salon last Friday, described
as " telling and lifelike " a picture called " Pain Senit,"
representing, he wrote, " a chorister-boy in a red surplice,
distributing the consecrated water, &c." So lifelike'
Firstly, no suoh vestment as "a red surplice" was ever
seen. Secondly, because the pain benit, which is being
distributed, even when translated by a Times Art-Critic,
does not mean'1 consecrated water," but'' blessed bread."
li "water" was a misprint for " wafer," his error is still
worse, and exhibits the scribe's ignorance of the subject,
the illustration of which he so jauntily describes as
'' lifelike." For two good mistakes, in two lines, on mat-
ters of fact, a Champion Blunderer would have some
difficulty in beating him, whoever he is. There are other
queer things in the same article. Is he a Wag?
REMEDIES A LA ROOSE
FOE THE WEAR AND TEAR OF LONDON LIFE.
"Life is not a bed of Roose's."
Motto adapted by Fortnightly Beviewisi.
Rule 1.—If, after some experience, you find that pork chops and
stout, taken the last thing before going to bed, disagree with you,
do not continue the custom. Do not leave it off all at once, but say a
chop at a time, and a proportionate amount less of stout.
Rule 2.—When you feel you must sleep, do not resist the impulse,
which is the prompting of Nature. Nature is a tender mother: and
sleep is her own old nurse. Sleep, therefore, whenever you feel
like it." This compliance with Nature's demand may occasionally
interfere with business. No matter—■
Dors, mon enfant, dors!
£t snore, mon enfant, snore!
Nature shows you the "dors." Out you go—from active life for a
time—then up you wake again fresh as a herring.
Rule 3.—The best time for the best work is the early morning. Rise
at 4'30 and feel that you are indeed "before the public"—for you
are awake before the public think of getting up. It is easy to dust your
own study, clean your own boots, brush your own clothes, and make
your own tea, coffee, or cocoa, and boil your own eggs. This will
save a servant: and you can pocket the wages and put them in a
savings-bank. Early rising necessitates early bedding: so to rise at
4 "30, means 8"30 p.m. for bed-time, sharp. In adopting this rule you
will have to consider the present customs of London Society, and
sacrifice them to yourself or yourself to them. Personally speaking,
as a Doctor, I can only say la sante avant tout. Let your rule be 4'30
to rise. Bed at 8'30 sharp. H you do this, you mil soon discover
that 8 or 8"30 is not the most convenient dinner hour. And the only
exceptions may be once in six weeks, when you invite professional
men to dine with you (Doctors for example), for which you can
specially prepare by taking two hours' repose before eight o'clock
dinner, and deferring bed-time till half-past eleven.
Rule 4.—Take plenty of exercise. If you like walking, walk. If
Sou dine in the middle of the day, you can start early and walk into
inner. If riding suits you, ride. If you can't take plenty of exer-
cise, go without it,—but go. It comes to pretty much the same—in
the end.
Rule 5.—As to drinking and eating: if you find red wines dis-
agree with you, don't take em: the same rule applies to white and
sparkling. Try everything in the way of food. When the right
thing is found, make a note of it, like Captain Cuttle. Such dishes,
so noted, you can call a series of "Cuttle-its." If you find sixteen
courses at dinner not enough, increase them by any number you
fancy; or if too much, lessen them.
Rule 6.—Coffee, brandy-and-soda, and liqueurs at all hours of
the day are only absolutely necessary in certain cases. If your own is
one of those cases, take them all: if not, don't. I do not recommend
alcoholic drinks to anyone to whom they are inexpressibly repugnant
or distasteful: in these instances the less alcoholio stimulant they
take the better for other people who like such drinks.
Rule 7.—Meat five times a day does not suit most persons, If it
does not rait you in particular, leave it off. Same rule applies to fish.
Rule 8.—When you (ret wet through, it is not advisable to sit in
your things before the kitchen fire till you are dry. More indigestion
is caused by this thoughtless process than most people are aware of.
Rule 9.—Smoke moderately. If this doesn't agree with you,
smoke immoderately. The first thing in the morning is the best
time for a strong cigar or pipe, in bed or immediately on rising from
it: smoke while dressing, and in your bath, as this latter habit pro-
vents a chill. If this system doesn't suit you, after giving it a fair
trial, don't persevere in it. There are more cases of nervous fibre
exhaustion arising from perseverance in what we don't like than most
people are inclined to suspect.
Rule 10.—Unwashed salads, uncooked vegetables, and unripe
fruit can be taken with impunity. Nature herself will tell you when
to leave off. In mixing salads, use plenty of strong vinegar made of
old beer. If oil is used, let it be L'huile du Cabillaud, or, in default
of this, L'huile de la Roulette. Perhaps the last is the best of all for
salad-making. Walnuts, or if you can't get these a pound or two of
the best Kent cob-nuts, are the best things for breakfast. You can
vary them with barcelonas occasionally. Always drink pure cocoa-
nut milk; but dilute it with a little hot-water, say about a table-
spoonful to half a tumbler. The cocoa-nut is a far better friend to
human nature than the cow.
Rule 11.—Avoid all draughts, hot rooms, crowded salons, theatres,
concert-halls, picture-galleries, ball-rooms, and all out-of-door enter-
tainments such as firework fetes at Crystal Palace, lawn-tennis
parties, garden-parties, walking or riding or driving in the Park,
and debates in the House of Commons, &o. All these are fatal.
Rule 12.—Be careful to change your clothing with the variations of
temperature. Send out some one, whom you can trust, to see and feel
what sort of a day it is, and dress accordingly.
Rule the Last.—Carefully shun doin$ anything you don't like,
and avoid bothering yourself about anything or anybody. Thus you
will escape the effects of the wear and tear of London Life.
(Signed) Roose in Urbe.

A distinguished suecess. Speeches shorter, and necessarily better.
The President peculiarly happy in his allusions to Russell Lowell
and Robert Browning, and in his touching reference to poor Ran-
dolph Caldecott. Among the guests, Lord Rosebehy's speech "took
the cake," with which, a Scotch one short" and sweet, Mr. Punch
will present his Lordship on the first opportunity. The dinner for the
Limners came from Limmer's; good; out when the little birds were
in due course set before a certain Illustrious Personage—
Exclaimed Prince Albert Victor of Wales,
"Tales Qualts !" id est "Such Quails!"
Which wasn't bad for the one among the party who had most recently
left school,—to come to the Academy.

So jubilant a day
Sawest thou ever, or so brave a sight,
Since first fair Flora trod

Since first our sons banded in brotherly
As on this morn of sweet, late-ooming Spring
Make London's ways with happyplaudits ring?
The Maypole towers no more
'Midst the huge City's roar,
But here is pageantry more glad and gay,
Of more significance
Than maddest song and dance
Of Merry England in her merriest May.

Makes our hearts flutter and our faces glow?
Out on the craven crew!
Here, now, our hearts renew [prime.

Spenser this sight might sing.
Great Shakspkare's silver ring
Circles us still as in his Tudor time,
But limits our Imperial sway no more,
Free of all seas, and fixed on every shore.
No Roman Triumph here!
Mute hatred, sullen fear.
Scowl not enshackled round this conquering
Peace's free offerings these, [car.
Not foemen's grudging fees,
Tributes of slaves, trophies of savage war.
These march with freemen's feet, and in their

No red lash lacerates, no fetter clanks.
Britannia and her brood,
Meet here in May-Day mood.
From every belt of the earth's climes they
come.
Like scattered children, they
Turn on this festal day
Back to the Mother Isle as to a home,
Unforced save by affection's flowery chain,
Bearing their sheaves, laden with gold and
grain.
From far Canadian snows,
From where the Orient glow's
With tints more radiant, and with ruddier

From sheep-thronged Austral plains,
And Afric s parched champaigns,
They march. Is there not music in their feet
To move to pride the pulses of the free.
More than in all the blasts of Victory?

Comely, and brave, and strong,
The paths of the old homestead sea-isled

Not alien, scarcely strange.
In all its verdurous range
There live no lips to which the ringing cheer
Rises not proudly at the kindling thought
Of all with which this pageantry is fraught.

Might stir at your free tread.
Their heirs are ye, as we are, and the bond
Links us across the deep,
Sea surge, and desert sweep,
Mountains above, and trackless wastes
beyond.
A spirit-federation wherein lies
A subtler tie than statecraft can devise.
Bring, bring your labour's fruits;
The lays of Lydian lutes
Were not so pleasant to our elder ear
As paaans in your praise,
Whose youth is strong to raise
Shoutings of hope that drown the dirge of

Your emulation is our sharpest spur.
Your victory all our thews to strain oan stir.
Free tributes from your soil,
And trophies of your toil,
Are triumphs grateful to us as our own.
An opulent parade!
By ministry of trade,
And alchemy of labour ye have grown,
After our own old fashion, with a stride
And to a stature which awakes our pride.
Our sons, in arts, in arms.
Fie upon poor alarms!
Britannia, with her brood around her,
knows
How, were her foes in ring,
Steel to her aid would spring
From Eastern jungles as from Northern
snows,
As in her children's peril, undismayed,
She, too, in their defence, would bare her
blade.
Think you that she '11 forget
Egyptian sands, vet wet
With unbought blood which dyed them for

Then welcome! Let the shout
Unitedly ring out,
A true fraternal phalanx who shall -break?
None save ourselves may mar this fair array,
This peaceful pageantry of English May!

originals? Well—one show at Burlington House is uncommonly
like another, only more so.
Some of our big artists are this year conspicuous by their fewness.
We are ready to admit that in English Art there is only one Millais,
and this year there is absolutely "only one Millais" in the Academy.
In the majority of oases we do not give the name of the artist, which can
be obtained by reference to the Official Catalogue, but prefer to let the
pictures speak for themselves, recording our first impressions of what
they ought to have meant. Now dip in the lucky-bag, and out come
thenumbers, all prizes and no blanks.
No. 1 will, of course, take care of itself.
No. 2. Charles the First saying to somebody who had evidently
no idea of decent behaviour, "Get out! don't undress here!"
No. 8. Mr. Bo-Peep finding his Sheep.
No. 20. The Wooden Sportsman. "I'm dressed like this in
sporting costume, but, as I ve only got wooden legs and no joints,
I can't get up out of this chair."
No. 47. Using up Old Materials. We've seen them all before.
All Burgess's old familiar friends, bless 'em! Glad to see you all
again. Au revoir—next year, eh?
No. 121. Portrait of Mr. J. L. Toole's Acting Manager, Mr. George
Lovedat, down on his luck. He has let all the private boxes, and
has just received a wire at 7"30 to say that H.R.H. is coming. [Ex-
cellent likeness, but why does he call himself " General William-
son?" Is the latter his professional name and title in Her Majesty's
Service ?]
No. 135. Lamb and Gravey. The Artist, Mr. J. C. Hoeslet,
R.A., has ohosen a delightful subject,—lambs and kids in a church-
yard. With that sly and subtle humour which distinguishes this
master, he has depicted the youthful nurse carrying the smallest kid
of the lot, while she, having left the others in the foreground, is flirt-
ing under the trees with a youthful swain. On the opposite side,
also in the background, the well-trained swain's dog is keeping at
bay the parson, who otherwise might interfere and spoil sport.
Mothers and daughters may perhaps turn aside from this picture, but
there is no doubt of its truth to nature, nor of the moral—the excel-
lent moral—which it really is intended to teach, if the spectator will
only take the trouble to extract it for himself.
No. 147. "Take away that Bubble!" Another bid for the Soap
Advertiser's second prizo of £2000. [Will Sir John E. Millais,
Bart., R.A., who won the first prize, be raised to the House of
Pears ?]
No. 190. This is by the Only Millais. It is an admirable portrait
ofithe immortal Mr.'Barlow, rendered more immortal than ever at
the moment'when he has put on his spectacles, and is looking about
everywhere* to ascertain why on earth those two young rascals,
Sandford and Merton, are not in the picture.
No. 203. Somebody told us that this is intended to be a portrait
of Lord Carington. He looks very angry: he is evidently out of
sorts, and saying, "I'm not myself at all. Perhaps it was at some
critical moment when he was quite another man. Who did it?
Voild tout, "that's Holl!" So like him. But not much like Lord
CAniNGTON.
No. 215. "Casting a Glance"—or, at all events, just abou to
throw her pince-nez at somebody.
No. 226. No doubt about this likeness. A picture of Still Life:
"Soft and Low."
No. 259. Who is this? Somebody sitting as model for a new
figure of Gog or Magog in Guildhall? On consulting the Catalogue,
I find it is " The Marquis of Jtipon," by himself-rquite by himself
—and painted by Mr. E. J. Poynteh. Poor Markiss!
No. 274. Portrait of the Right Hon. Mr. Joseph Chamberlain
as he appeared when disturbed by the announcement of a visitor in
the middle of one of his letters to the G. O. M. It is taken at the
moment when he is saying, "Dear me! most provoking! Didn't
mean to bo 'At Home' to-day. Afraid I've got a button off my
waistcoat—and I'm wearing out one of my old shirts."
No. 285. Marblelous! No doubt whose hand executed this.
Evidently Alma Mater—no, we mean Alma Tadema, who, if ever
he is titled, should be made a K.C.M.B., or Knight of the Cool
Marble Bath.
No. 497. A fine example of Armitage after Herbert.
No. 521. No mistaking this for anybody but the person for whom
the artist, Mr. Robert Gibbs, intended it, yclept, H. M. Stanley,
the Explorer and great Traveller. He is represented, as he always
is, on his legs, for he hadn't even time to sit for his portrait, nor, we
should have thought, to stand for it. As a life-like portrait, without
question of artistic merit, it is one of the best in the show.
No. 632. The Punter Gambolling; or. Leader and the Swans.
No. 688. (Goodall, R.A.) and No. 244 (Hebbebt, R.A.), both
treat the history of Susannah. That the Elders should each give a
different colouring to the story was to be expected as a matter of
course. The first Elder, however, is far nearer the naked truth than
the second. Out of deference to Mr. H-rsl-y our artist cannot
illustrate the subject.
No. 737. Sporting Picture. Quite a real July day for Hunting.
Lady out walking with light summer dress and parasol. Evidently
First Meet of the Can't-be-much-Hotter Hounds. The Huntsmen
and whips are in the Vale, waiting for servants to bring out straw-
berry ices and cool drinks. Every sportsman will rejoice in this
picture.
No. 732. The Backward Girls' School. Pupils learning their
Letters by heart,—at post-time.

Directoes of Public Opinion in Aht.

"Look at these," said May, showing a lapful of withered primroses, dog-
roses, violets, and may blossom. "I gleaned these during five minutes walk
in the wake of some holiday-making Cockney cads, and some hedge-breaking,
bank-trampling London costers. They had been' a-Maying '—after their fashion.
That is to say that, some for sordid gain, others in wanton sport, they had been
making wild havoc among my hedge-rows, coppices, and hollows, stripping ruth-
lessly, crushing recklessly, wasting wildly. In fact, just as Fashion, in its mad
fancy for bird-trimmings, is fast making the woods songless, so louts and hucksters
THE HAWARDEN MERLIN AND THE IRISH VIVIEN.
A storm was coming, but the winds were still
And in the wild woods of Hawarden, there,
Before a British oak so huge and old.
It looked a tower of solid mason-work.
At Merlin's feet the scheming Vivien lay. _
And Merlin locked his hand in hers, and.said,
"Oh, did ye never lie upon the shore,
And watch the coming opposition'wave,
Glass'd in the slippery sand before it breaks?
Ev'n such a wave, by no means pleasurable,
Dark in the glass of some presageful mood,
Had I for three months seen ready to fall.
And then I rose and fled the Treasury Benoh,
To break the mood. You followed me unask'd;
And when I looked and saw you following still,
You seemed that wave about to break upon me,
And sweep me from my hold upon the world,
My use and name and tame. But that is past:
For deftly have I turned, and now 'tis I
That follow thee, and whither thou dost lead
There trip I daintily, nor reck the cost
Of granting to thee, this, thy little boon."
And Vivien answer'd, smiling pleasantly,
"I own that ye have trod right daintily
Whither I led you, yet must I confess
I ever fear'd ye were not wholly mine.
For even now, a prey to party wiles,
I fancy I may lose thee—see thee scared
From off thy nobler purpose. So then haste
To prove to me that thou in truth art mine,
And teach me so that I may know the charm
Of woven phrases and of waving words
As proof of trust. 0 Merlin', teach it me!
The charm so taught will charm us both to rest."
Then answered Merlin, " Some would bid me fear,
Giving you power upon me through this charm,
Lest you might play me falsely, having power,
However well ye think ye love me now
(As sons of kings loving in pupilage
Have turn'd to tyrants when they came to power).
Thus Hartington and But out and Chamberlain
Have one and all thrown out their dark'ning hints
And bade me pause, and daily read the Times
Before I pass the brink, and shatter all."
To which the wily Vivleh quick replied,
"0 Merlin, think you not I love you well,—
That I will keep my plighted faith with thee I
That tribute shall be paid, that liberty
Shall be the equal lot of all in all
This dost thou doubt I Ah no, thou canst not doubt,
Thou know'st that in the golden years to come,
No vantage taking from its vantage ground,
The Parliament, once met on College Green,
Will hold to Empire, and so loyally
Do righteous service, and keep honest faith
That all the world shall mark thy work, and cry
'Amen,' and say 'twas wisely, bravely done."
So she. And then she called him lord and liege,
Her seer, her bard, her silver star of eve,
Her god, her Merlin, the one passionate love
Of her whole life, till he both overtalked
And overworn by her too cloying Bpeech,
Had yielded, told her all the charm, and slept
Then in one moment she put forth the charm
Of woven phrases and of waving words,
And in the hollow oak he lay as dead.
And lost to life and use and name and fame;
Then crying " I have made his glory mine,"
And shrieking out, "He's done!" the harpy leapt
Adown the forest, and the thicket olosed
Behind her, and the forest eoho'd " Done!"
and badge-flaunting politicians are doing their best to make the fields and forests
flowerless, and rob the ripening year of my lavish largesse of wild flowers, which
Chaucer sang in tones as fresh as my dew-drops, and which has been the delight
and consolation of myriads of tired eyes and gentle hearts since first an English
foot trod an English meadow."
"I see," sail Mr. Punch, significantly; "and I will see to it, be sure."
Whereupon May, with a sunny smile of gratitude, sped away over the meadows
on her old benignant mission, and Mr. Punch, with knitted brow, returned to his
urban sanctum to put a rod in pickle for the callous deflowerers of his well-loved
floral month. Let the louts ana loobies look to it!
The Home Question and True Answer.—Tho extracts
from the speeches of Fox, and the writings of Stdnet
Smith on the Irish Home Rule Question, as given by Corre-
spondents in the Daily News, have been admirably appro-
priate. But Mr. Punch would sum up all that can be said
on the subj eot in one question, which is, " Has the English
Nation, invariably, and as a rule, done to the Irish as they
would wish the Irish should do to them P" There can be
but one plain answer, "Most decidedly not." Therefore,
when the opportunity arrives—Fiat justitia, ruat caelum!

all the cab-shelters, and a staff of young men, with guaranteed calves,
always available to act as footmen to accompany the Victorias and
Landaulettes.
THE WHISTLER EXHIBITION.
There's a funny Exhibition, a sensation for the Maytime,
The Whistlerian "arrangement," so he says, "in brown and gold;"
If you 're passing up New Bond Street, ask at Dowdeswell's, in the
daytime.
Where the little panorama of queer pictures is unrolled.
Jimmy Whistles can do nothing just like any other fellow,
Here are very tiny pictures with a precious lot of frame;
While above you hangs an awning diabolically yellow,
And the footman in attendance is a mass of gamboge flame.
Here are "Harmonies" and "Notes" too, and hera hangs each
mystic "Nocturne,"
Just a sort of painted chaos of a melancholy green;
There is one that's pen-and-inky, if it gives you quite a shook, turn
To the dabs of paint—the people on the sands at Trouville seen.
Let us gaze upon this spectre with the legs a trifle shaky,
That s the green and brown" Orlando, as folks saw it down at
Coombe;
But that black and gold " arrangement"—a mad girl—quite " takes
the cake," I
Can imagine that she's saying, " What a show and what a room!"
Mr. Justice Mathew and Mr. Justice A. L. Smith were the
"Vacation Judges." No better Judges of a Vacation than these
two. We hope they enjoyed themselves.

ONE COL. ON'Y OF COLONIES

There have been a few duels between the Author of
La France Juire and severe critics of his book. Its
Publisher might advertise it as illustrated with Cuts.
Madame Adam wrote to deny that she was Juive. The
wife of Adah might also have added that there are few
prettier Christian names than Eve.
THE REEL OPENING OF THE GREAT EXHIBISHTJN.
In course I was present perfeshnally at the fust opening of the grand Colo-
nyal and Ingian Exhibition, for whenever certain importent Gents is gathered
together, and you want to make 'em comferal and good natured, of course you
must give 'em summat nice to eat and summat nice to drink, and so in course
you carnt do without Waiters. Of course I am not eluding to yesterday's
opening, wen heverybody and ennybody could go in for a ginny, but the reel
fust opening, about a lortnite ago, as was reserved for the Gentlemen of the
Press, or as one of 'em rudely called theirselves, the PreBs Gang. I was standing
quietly watching their arrival, and thinking wot a jolly nice perfession theirs
must be, always in the best places and always well looked arter, and nothink
to pay, when there occurd another of them wunderfool things as so offen
appens to me. For seeing me a standing there, looking with a degree of respec
amost amounting to haw at them as has it in their power to make anythink,
however splendid, a failure, and anythink else, however silly, a sucksess, who
should take a site at me but Sir Cuni.iffe Owing, the Commander-in-Chief of
the whole blooming lot, and he says to me, says he, "Come along, Mr. Robert,
you are one of us, you know." I was so estenished that I reelly thinks as I
amost blushed, tho not quite used to the blushing mood, as the Marshoness
said wen she seed the new Bally. However I jined 'em in their Journey; but
of course, as good taste dicktates, keeping at such a respeckfool distance as might
lend enchantment to the view.
The fust thing as we seed was summat as made me turn pail with estoniali-
ment. It is called "Jungle Life." Ah, it must be sumthink like life to live
in a Jungle like that. It shows you a reglar thick wood in India, with such
trees and bushes as I never seed afore, full of a reglar crowd of Elephants and
Tigers and Snakes and Bears and Lepperds and things.
One of the Press Gentlemen kindly told me the names of sum of the werry
strangest Beastes there. Such as the Great Bore, that everybody awoids, the
Cheat'em from Monaco, the Covey's Gammon, the Bare Singer, quite nude, the
Samburn, which wasn't a bit like him, the Porkypie, with his hookey nose, the
Bufferlow. or low buffer, the Allygaiters, but not wearing 'em, and the Hoggish
Dear, or large female feeder. My kind informant wanted to perswade me
that a slippery, black-looking, slimy sarpent, was a Dyson, but I wasn't quite
such a fool as to beleeve that, for I had jest before heard him called a Piethon.
Well, after this we set out on our Travels, with our Commander-in-Chief a
leading the way, and me a bringing up the rear like a Mager-General of the
Commyserriet, as they calls the wittels and drink Department in the Harmy.
Ah, what a Traveller Sir Philip must ha bin! Why ne guided us all through
Ingia, then through Africay, and then through all the Horsetrailian Colonvs, as
if he had spent all his life in each one of 'em sepperately and knowed em all by
Art. And in each differing Country he gave us little 5 minute lecture that told
us all about 'em, and I lernt more Jografy, I think it's called, in that two
hours voyage than I hever lernt in all my long life afore. Ah, wot he carrys in
his not werry big head must be about enuff for a Commander-in-Cheef, and a
Prime Minister and a Chance-seller of the Xchecker all in won. I wasn't at
all aware 'till then that Canada was quite so close to Queensland, but then we
all lives and learns, Hed Waiters and all. When we was in Africa, which
wasn't near so hot as I expected, my kind frend pointed out to me the Dimond
Washings, and showed me the black holes as they took the werry biggest dimonds
out of. I had jest a shadder of dowt as to the strict werassity of this statement,
but he looked so serious, and withstood my stern gaze bo carmly that I was
forced to yield.
What struck me most when we got to New South Whales was the pride as
they takes in their galliant Wollunteers. There is a splendid large Photygraff,
about six or seven feet high, with butiful likenesses of ewery one of the brave
fellers as wollunteered to fite with us in the Soodang last year; and this I will
say, that a finer lookin set of smart fellers I never seed, not even at Holdyer-
shot; and what I shoud like to see dun wood be for the old Copperashun to give
a grand Bankwet of thanks to as many of 'em as has come over, in their old
Gildhall, and I prommisses, in the name of my Order, that we will all wollun-
teer to wait on 'em for nothink, no, not ewen for taking care of their Ate!
I leaves to my Bretheren of the Press the tarsk of describing the menny
butiful things as we seed, they 're more used to that sort of thing than me;
but I quite agreed with the gushing Heditor of one of the Sporting Papers who
I wentered to speak to on the subjec, and who said he was quite reddy to offer
five ponys to two that for wunderful works of Natur, ana butiful works of
Hart, siteh a collection had never bin seen since Hexebishnns was first inwented,
for he knew as he should win in a canter with both hands down. I didn't like
to ask him why he kept so many ponys, he might have thought it rude, or why
he should put both his hands down when he won, he might have thought me
hignorant; but jest to give a slite idear of the way as they does things in I
I may menshun, as there is jest a mere Pidgin House, sent over as a sample,
is, all smothered over with butiful carving, and cost about £5,000!
When the Gentlemen of the Press retired to Lunch, I acumpanied them to the
dore, but I knowed my place better than to enter that abode of bliss, though
by that time I was that jolly hungry that I could ewen have eaten sum oold
mutton, not that there was anythink of that sort there; so I retired to my propper
place, gratefool tho' hungry.

LAST WORDS.
The Representatives of the Five Powers to M. Delyannis.
We are in receipt of your reply in answer to our last friendly
communication, telling us " to mind our own business," asking us a
Thessalian conundrum, and enclosing us a ribald caricature sketch
of our individual selves begging at the door of the Pirteus, and we
herewith acknowledge the same. We must, however, protest that
after our concessions about the first ultimatum, it is not the Bort of
tone, at least in a public diplomatic document, we should have
thought it reasonable in you to have adopted. However, we have no
wish to threaten, but we must really beg of you to be reasonable.
Can you not at least let it be given out that you consent to disarm,
and so save us from the very disagreeable duty of taking ulterior
measures. Believe us, it goes very much against our grain to say so
much as this, but as we have got the ships here, you see we must do
something. So, be generous—and meet us half-way. Let us have
a pacific reply. Pray do, for we shall be really greatly obliged
to you.
M. Delyannis to the Representatives of the Five Powers.
Yah! You are a set of nincompoops. Think I am going to
disarm! Not a bit of it. Have just ordered the reserves up to the
front. How do you like that? As to your "ulterior measures "—
take them when you like. Who cares! Neither Ego nor Rex
Meus. So fire away!
The Representatives of the Five Powers to M. Delyannis.
We are in reoeipt of your last despatch, but have agreed, out of
consideration for you, to regard it as unread. So we most willingly
give you an additional twenty-four hours in which you oan think
the matter over, and endeavour to frame something a little more
friendly in spirit. We must, out of mere respeot for the Govern-
ments we represent, point out to you the impropriety of calling us
names. However, we do not wish to press this point, but hope to
hear from you in a conciliatory vein, so that we may not be under
the very painful necessity of having recourse to those ulterior
measures which, believe us, we refer to even now with the greatest
reluctance.
M. Delyannis to the Representatives of the Five Powers.
Call yourselves " Gentlemen," do you? Why, I wouldn't give half
a drachma for a dozen of you. Who are you to teach me manners, I
should like to know? As to your threats, take care that I don't
send you all packing on my own account. That's what you ought
to get, and will, if you don t look out.
The Representatives of the Five Powers to M. Delyannis.
The Representatives of the Five Powers present their compli-
ments to M. Delyannis, and beg to inform him that, under all the
circumstances of the case, they have come to the conclusion that
they had better anticipate the undesirable necessity of his having
recourse to extreme measures to which he refers, ana that they will
therefore temporarily withdraw themselves from the Piraeus. They
trust that, in doing so, they will not be misunderstood, and that
their action will not be taken as any indication of a hostile attitude
to the Greek Government, whose curious antics they will still
continue to watch from a distance both with solicitude and interest.
Lilly-bolero !—Of Mr. W. S. Lilly's two volumes of Chapters in
European History (Chapman and Hall), and of his careful and
opportune article on Liberty and Liberalism, in the Fortnightly, we
shall have something to say later on. For the moment we will observe
to any one inclined to dispute Mr. Lilly's premises or conclusions, that
he is evidently " a nasty one to tackle"—not a water-Lilly, but a
tiger-Lilly. Beware! We have heard that an eminent Aoademician
would not undertake his portrait, for this year's show, on the plea
that he could not paint the Lilly. Was it Sir J. E. M. who said this P
And was it through the influence of the other Lily (of Jersey), whose
portrait by Sir Everett will be in everybody's recollection, that the
public have been deprived of another great work of Art? If so, such
jealousy is LiLLi-putian.

NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.
(Items a la Mode.)
Her Majesty's ship Timorout that started
yesterday from Portland for the trial practice
of her new 83-ton guns, returned this morn-
ing for repairs, owing to the unexpected
blowing up of three of them. The hull is
naturally much damaged by the explosion,
for which, however, no reasonable cause has
been assigned. The officers in charge, do
not on this oocasion, refer the accident to
faulty loading, and it is imagined that in-
quiry will establish the fact that there must
nave been some slight defect, probably in the
outer metal case. A full investigation of the
matter will take plaoe on the return of what
is left of the vessel to port, but it is not sup-
posed that her neoessary repairs can be com-
pleted under three years.
The Majestic, oompoBite screw sloop, went
over the measured mue yesterday, but some-
what disappointed the Authorities in her
going powers, which, owing to the rapid pri-
ming of her boilers, did not show a higher
record than three knots and a half under all
the steam that could be got on to her. There
being also a slight sea on, her rolling was
considerable, and in turning she heeled over
to such an extent, showing an angle of
seventy-two degrees on the record, that for
some moments there was visible alarm mani-
fested by all on board as to whether she
would right herself again. She, however,
got safely back, and it is estimated that after
she has been dry-docked and undergone cer-
tain radical alterations in her construction,
these defects may be partially remedied.
From Malta it is reported that the
Armourer, that had run out of coals
300 miles from land, and got something the
matter with her screw, had been towed into
harbour by a passing tug. It is under-
stood that her main-shaft, supplied in her
refit at Portsmouth, has again broken, and
it is now announced that she will have to be
brought home for the necessary repairs.

more whom We don't, but whose acquaintance Our Affability indicates that
We should be delighted to make on the spot, were there time to stop for it, or,
on our return, if they are still there. It occurs to me that" Our Affability is
a suitable title on such an occasion. So Our Affability walks on, thinking how
mighty easy it is, on a beautiful fine day, to bow pleasantly to everybody where
everybody is happily smiling, and not to care one single twopenny dash for
anybody or anything, as long as not even the pertinacious house-fly is present
to disturb and upset Our Affability.
We take our seats in the Albert Hall, which is filling rapidly. Undistin-
guished people, in distinguished uniforms, arriving fast, ana filling the arena.
A solitary individual, in a velvet Court suit, near us, is evidently wishing he
could run home and change it, while others, who have left their uniform or
Court dress at home, on beholding him, are regretting their decision, as a
uniform on such an occasion would have given them an air of distinction.
Regret* are too late now.
Arrival of celebrities, chiefly Sir Rich aed Cross. From the moment he
appears he occupies the Hall, becoming, as it were, "the man in possession,"
Sir Richard is not in uniform, but he is glad to see that other people are,
and he smiles, smirks, and beams on all his friends in and out of uniform,
political and social, with whom he shakes hands, and continues shaking hands
for the next half-hour, welcoming every one of them as they come in, or
delighted to see them if they are already seated, so that, to any outsider, who
might have casually j ust dropped in without the faintest idea of what was
going on, it would appear that the little dapper, smirking, restless gentleman in
the centre of the Hau is giving an " At Home," and has, in the prodigality of
his hospitality, issued so many invitations that he has been compelled, at the
last moment, to engage the Albert Hall, where he is now receiving his many
friends, from all parts of the world, in the most genial manner possible. Sir
Ri chard's chief guests—for whom the lively and amiable host has provided
a splendid chair under a magnificent canopy, and several golden-back chairs
arranged in a semicircle, as if for the occupation of a band of superfine, extra-
quality Christy Minstrels, when they will sing " 0 those Gulden Chain I"—
have not yet arrived.
A couple of Heralds appear on the dais, in a compromising costume of
tabards and trousers, but not finding anything particular to do, they become
uncomfortable, and, after a feeble attempt at appearing entirely at their ease,
they, somewhat ignominiously, retire. Siamese and Japanese Ambassadors
enter. With these Sib Richard Cross has nothing to do: he is glad to
see them, nothing more, he is not effusive, and as they pass on, the shadow,
that had momentarily clouded their radiantly bilious countenances, caused
by Sir Richard's apparent indifference, is dispelled by the warm greeting
given them by the gorgeous Foreign Ambassadors and their ladies, who are
all in one corner together, chatting and laughing, and who all bob up and
down, one after the other, like the hammers of a pianoforte during the per-
formance of an andante passage, as various Excellencies arrive, rising in
chords of three or four notes at a time to greet the American Minister, who,
in his ordinary evening dress, looks as if he had been out very late the night
before, somewhere in a Hammersmith direction, and after a wash and brush-
up, had iust taken Sir Richard Cross's little party, at the Albert Hall, on
his road nome.
More Ambassadors,—more Ministers: all more and more decorated—then
magnificent Indian Princes, who pass Sir Richard without a word, and

stalk, with majestic bearing, towards a corner, where they remain, glittering.
Sir Richard, recoTering from his astonishment at their unexpected appearance,
addresses himself anxiously to someone in a diplomatic uniform, and is evidently
inquiring " How those fellows got in f" The answer is satisfactory, as, in a
few seconds, Sir Richard beams again, till the sight of Sir W. Vernon
Harcotjrt and Mr. Osborne Morgan, in Ministerial dress, gives him such
a shock that he collapses, and sinks on to a seat where, for a while, among a
lot of tall men in uniforms, he is lost to the public gaze.
More Colonials and Indian Princes until the gold and diamonds begin to
pall upon us. Somebody just behind us, who is familiar with everybody's
name, and who, as the proverbial " Well-informed Person," has been pointing
out all the celebrities to his wife—and all wrong, of course—now exclaims,
"There's Joe Hoare !" whom we in the vicinity suppose to be some banking
oelebrity famous in the City, but who, it turns out, is the Sultan of Johore,
with diamonds in his cap worth a monarch's ransom,—that is, always depend-
ing upon the value of the monarch to be bought out.
For a few seconds Mr. Comyns Carr becomes the centre of attraction. He
looks all around pleasantly, as if he were there, as everybody's friend, to see
if everybody is comfortably seated, and everybody appearing to be all right, he
nods a smiling benison on the arrangements generally, and disappears.
Lord Wolsbley, in mufti, slides into a seat. Suddenly, as if jerked up in
the air by a spring, rises Mr. Doyly Carte, from among the crowd in the
stalls, and shows as much of himself as is generally seen of one of the appari-
tions out of the cauldron in Macbeth. He is evidently considering whether it
wouldn't pay to run the Indian Princes, in their present costumes, for a tour,
with an Entertainment—which could easily be knocked together by Gilbert
and Sullivan—round the country, as "The Thespian Carte Company, No.
3," and then take them to the 8tates " for the fall/' Either the word " tall"
has shaken his faith in the idea, or his meditations hare been distracted by
the appearance of the Bishop of London on the dais, looking, in his lawn
sleeves and Doctor of Divinity's robe, as if he had been woke up suddenly out
of bed, and had had only time to slip a red dressing-gown, without sleeves, over
his robe de nuit, and had " come as he was" to the Albert Hall, for Mr.
D'Oyly Carte strokes his beard with a calculating, thoughtful air, and goes
down into his seat slowly, like the setting sun, or as if he were being lowered,
in a dignified manner, by machinery. His descent is the signal for Sir Richard
to jump up suddenly, and have a chat with the nearest man in uniform, whom
he quite takes by surprise.
At this instant, considerable cheering. Sir Richard, astonished at the
moment chosen, but evidently prepared to consider the occasion as justifying
this testimony to his popularity, is
about to acknowledge the ovation
with grateful alacrity, when his
friend points out to him that tin
greeting had been given to Madame
Albani; whereat, and on the imme-
diate disappearance of his friend in
diplomatic uniform, Sir Richard
once more subsides, crushed, and,
before he can recover himself, he is
overwhelmed by a deluge of magnifi-
cently accoutred Gentlemen-at-Arms,
with swords, helmets, and halberds,
whose gorgeousness, as it were, flows
over the arena, and so utterly swamps Sir
Richard, that for the next half-hour he is
unable even to come up to the surface, like an
oppressed fish, and gasp for air. So until
Royalty arrives, Sir Richard has no other
occupation than to study the back buttons
and the belt and upper portion of the trousers
of the particular Gentleman-at-Arms who has
temporarily shut out Sir Richard Cross from
all communication with the outer world.
More applause, of which Sir Richard can
take no notice, and the appearance of Sir
Arthur Sullivan in Court suit brings Mr.
D'Oyly Carte up again, all smiles. "i'
he is evidently murmuring to himself,"
isn't Gilbert knighted and here in a C
dress too? I know he's got one, because I vt
seen him in it. What an advertisement for the °a Richard receives.
Savoy!" Then once more the brilliancy of the Indian Princes fascinates him,
and slowly muttering to himself, "If you like the pickle, try the sauce," he
once more imitates the setting sun, and, stroking his beard in true Oriental
fashion, subsides not ungracefully. Suddenly Mr. Trendell, arrayed like
Sir Arthur in the alternative Court suit, which is more showy than the
velvet at the price, and bearing a marked resemblance to Lord Alcester—
more widely known as Admiral Sir Beach'em-and-don't-go-to-Sea-more—
hurries up to the dais, and beckons authoritatively to somebody or something
—it is either a man or a pigeon—to come down at once, and, if a bird,
perch on his outstretched finger. As neither bird, nor man, obeys the sum-
mons, the Literary Superintendent accepts defeat with a smile, and crossing to
the Archbishop of Cantrrbury, who has just joined the Bishop of London
on the dais, stays with them to explain quite pleasantly the probable
reason of the absence of the pigeon or the man, whichever it was.
Then the Archbishop of Canterbury, who with his Chaplain and the
Bishop of London, had been together examining a book of the ceremonial,
apparently with the view of finding an opening for a trio—by the kind
permission of Sir Arthur 8ullivan and Mr. Barn by,—takes this oppor-
tunity of consulting Mr. Trendell as to ths practicability of such an
introduction; and the Literary Superintendent evidently not liking to give a
point-blank refusal, calls up Mr. Clowes, the printer of the work in question,


Leading the Procession.
who, also disguised in an alternative Court dress, which gives him the brisk
official air of a junior Admiral, enlivened by the appropriate joviality of
the Sandboy, approaches the Bishops on the subject—and on the dais—and
tells them that, even if Mr. Trendell wrote the words on the spot, he
couldn't undertake to print it in the time. At this moment the Archbishop
and Bishop catch sight of Sir Arthur Sullivan bearing down towards them
from behind the throne, and there is that in his eye [his glass] which tells
them that, Dignitaries of the Church though they he, he will stand no inter-
ference with his musical department, and so the three ecclesiastical conspirators
—like the three Anabaptists in the Prophete—disperse, and pretend, in a Toots-
like fashion, that" it's of no consequence," much to
the relief of Messrs. Trendell and Clowes, who
began to fear that at the last moment there might
be some unpleasantness, which would have compelled
them to call for the interference of Sir Charles
Warren, the new Chief Commissioner of Police,
whose first public duty, had it been necessary to
proceed to extremities, would have been to take
an Archbishop and a Bishop into custody for
disturbing the harmony of the proceedings at the
opening of the Colonial and Indian Exhibition.
However, all passes off quietly. Sir Arthur,
still with his eye-glass fixed on the Arch-
bishop, as much as to say, " Tou °d better not
try any amateur Gregorian trio here without
my permission, my boy," walks slowly towards
Madame Albani, to whom, after a short con-
sultation with Mr. Barnby, during which the
expression on the countenances of both
musicians becomes fierce and determined,
he explains the serious aspectof the occa-
sion. A diversion is produced by Mr.
Trendell coming up to show Madame
Albani the golden key of the Exhibi-
tion; and on Madame Albani inquiring
"whether that is the key she is to take for ' Home, Sweet Home,' " every-
body's face is wreathed in smiles, Mr. Clowes rhymes with his name and
"bows," Mr. Trendell laughs heartily, Sir Arthur is convulsed, and the
Archbishop, Bishop, and Chaplain at the other side of the dais pluck np a
bit, and begin to feel that the danger is averted.
"She is coming!" A thrill through the audience, and Sir Richard
Cross, being freed from pressure by a movement of the Gentleman-at-Arms,
lies up to the surface lor air, and snaps at a man in a diplomatic uniform
as if he were a summer-fly skimming the surface. But the insect escapes,
and the Gentleman-at-Arms once more forming himself into a column, again
distributes himself over the area which includes Sir Richard, who is thence-
forth finally obliterated.
The Procession! A Stout Policeman out of Drury Lane Pantomime—" by
kind permission of Mr. Augustus Harris"—leads the way. Clown and
Pantaloon engaged elsewhere, and so the Policeman is not tripped up, nor does
his head come off and go up by a string to Mr. Auoustus Harris, who is
seated in a box aloft quite ready to take it. Then the Heralds: Rouge
Dragon, wagging his tail pleasantly, no fire or smoke coming out of his
mouth: rather a nervous and pleasantly disposed Dragon, judging by his appear-
ance now. After him magnificent persons bearing some huge golden maces
I'd have had all these chaps in big heads," says Augustus Druriol ants
to himself), then General Sir Somers Vine with hit head at all events screwed
properly on his shoulders, so that there is no danger of his losing it, telling
them where to go, and preventing the amateur supernumeraries from getting
clubbed up together in a corner. (" Ought to have rehearsed this," murmurs
Augustus Druriolanus, shaking his head pathetically.) Next, all the
other Commissioners, then the Treasurer of the Household (" Nice time he'll
have of it next Saturday," murmurs Augustus Druriolanus, " hope ' the
Ghost will walk'"), then the Vice-Chamberlain, then the Lord Steward
(without the basin), and then, amid all the gold and scarlet and blaza of
precious stones and jewels and gold, a small elderly lady in deep black, grace-
fully curtseying left and right, and acknowledging the deafening cheers with
which she is being received.
Gentlemen! The Queen!
Then the Prince of Wales, in one of his uniforms, and at his elbow the
graceful, ever youthful charming Princess of Wales. The golden chairs are
there ready for use. The Royalties seem nervous and uncertain as to what
they've got to do (" Ought to have rehearsed this, you know," mutters
Augustus, who is becoming fidgety), and H.R.H., on being consulted by
the Princess in a whisper, evidently replies, aside, "Stand where you like,
my dear, only, for goodness sake, don't make a fuss"—and the Royalties
stand accordingly, until the Queen, with a sharp nod and a peremptory rap
with her fan, indicates her sovereign pleasure that the whole lot of them are
to be seated. Then Albani sings a little thing of Tennyson's, music com-
posed by Arthur Sullivan, which goes very well, though the Composer
must have sighed to himself, "Oh, for one verse of Gilbert!" Albani
tries her best to make the line " Glorying between sea and sky" fit into the
air, and is probably blessing neither the Poet nor the Composer.
This being over, the Prince steps forward, and faces the Quern,—as if
both were about to perform an Irish jig, but, changing his mind at the last
moment, H.R.H. reads a paper, explaining, as if quite as an afterthought
and by way of a pleasant surprise, wny they have brought Her Majesty all
the way from Windsor Castle to London. "Ah!" the Queen appears to
say, "yes—that's exactly what I want to know." Then Her Majesty
listens most graciously to the end. At one time it seems as if the Gracious
Lady were about to ask for further information on some points, but, catching
sight of the hopeless expression on the countenances of the major and minor
Royalties, who, including the Duke of Cambridge, are all penned up like
sheep (in uniform) between the orchestra and the golden chairs, Her Majesty
I

restrains her desire for further enlightenment; and, on her signifying her
readiness to receive the Official Catalogue to take home with her, and the
master-key of the Exhibition, so that Her Majesty can come in and out at
all hours without either paying at the doors or showing a season-ticket,
Sir George Hatter Chubb, in velvet Court suit, with sword by his
side, ascends to the dais and presents the key, which Her Majesty gra-
ciously accepts, but being unable to find a pocket in her dress handy for its
reception, is obliged to entrust it to the care of the Prince of Wales, to be
left with him till called for. Then Mr. Clowes gaily mounts the steps and
presents the Catalogue, closely followed by Mr. Turn deli, with the Hand-
book, which he has compiled all by himself. This part of the function being
concluded, the three performers have to sidle down the steps with a crab-like
action, keeping one eye on their Sovereign and another on the step below.
It is a trying moment, but they reach the floor in safety, whereat there is
Borne slight attempt at applause on the part of their anxious friends, which
is instantly suppressed on the commencement of Her Majesty's reply, which
she reads with a slightly foreign accent, but in a clear, distinct, and pleasant
voice, and then kisses H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, as a reward for his having
behaved himself up to now bo remarkably well, and having been, in a general
way, such a very good boy.
Then steps forward Lord Kenmare, and waving his Chamberlain's wand
after the manner of the Good Fairy in the transformation scene, only in a
timid, amateurish sort of way ("Why didn't he come to me or Katti
1.inner for a lesson?" growls Augustus Druriolanus, quite losing all
patience with them), he declares the Show open. The wand cannot exerciso a
very potent spell, as there is no transformation—nobody changes into any-
thing; it has no sort of effect even on Sir Richard Cross or on Mr. D'Oyly
Carte, but it sets in motion the trumpeters, who flourish like a green bay-
tree, and then are heard no more. After this comes the Archbishop's chance;
he finds the right place, and reads something between a prayer and an address
in a dainty, aesthetic fashion. Whereupon follows the Prayer of Prayers,
amid a hum of devout responses.
After this, the " Hallelujah Chorus." Differences of opinion as to position
arise; Her Majbsty really doesn't see why the Royalties should stand, and
aits; H.U.H. the Princess, being of a reverential turn, whispers to the Prince,
"It's not the fashion to sit during the " Hallelujah Chorus,'and stands up,—
»o do the other Royalties. Prince looks uncommonly doubtful. If he could
stand up on one side, and sit on the other, that would meet the difficulty.
He elects to remain bolt upright; and so, graciously yielding to the majoritv
in favour of the erect attitude, Her Majesty rises, and remains standing till
the finish of the "Hallelujah."
Then comes the treat of the day,—Albani singing " Home, Sweet Home."
Delicious! In the course of the second verse, a flute, or an oboe, or a
flageolet executes a bird-liko warble, apparently just behind tho Duke of
Cambridge's head, which so startles that gallant warrior that he sharply faces
about, and severely scrutinises the orchestra, evidently muttering to himself,
"If I could find out the confounded fellow who's doing this, I'd order him
under arrest—like a shot—and court-martial him, I would!"
But the delinquent is not discovered, and, when " HonUj Sweet Home" is
finished, the Commander-in-Chief is prevented from drawing his sword and
plunging in among the musicians, by the general irresistible movement
that carries him off with all the other Royalties into their places in the
Procession, which is now slowly moving out to the chorus of "Rule,
Britannia .'" and the Queen thanks Sir P. Cunliffe Owes, who all this
time, attired in Civil Service costume, has kept modestly in the background,
saying, " Sir Philip, this is all Owen to you," and thrice graciously bowing
to everybody from the top of the steps, Her Gracious Majesty graciously
vanishes from our view, and we, the anybodies, nobodies, and somebodies,
justle, and shove, and crush, and get out into the Gardens, where forthwith
we begin to enjoy the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, 1886, and on the first
opportunity we drink to its success under the Btyle and title of "The

UN-ENGLISH SUGGESTION.
Mb. Punch,
! _ Democracy is indeed, in its own language, " a goin' of it."
It has initiated a movement for the habitual omission from utter-
ance of the letter "H." Yes, Sir, 'Abby 'as'is defenders. In a
paper read before a Provincial Literary and Philosophical Society, to
a popular audience, and since published, default of the aspirate
is actually extenuated. Kay, its disuse is advocated even. From a
London journal there is also quoted a "plea" treating exactness
in using it as a species of affectation. A notable point in one of
these apologies is the theory that, as some people are partially colour -

Your revolutionists pretend that the pronunciation of A is modern.
The good old English h was a silent h. "Inthe sixteenth century
the word ' Hebrew' was spelt' Ebrue.'" Well, to be sure, Fahtaff
backed a "banger" with the alternative, "Or I am a Jew else, an
Ebrew Jew." But then wasn't he mimicking the popular pronuncia-
tion? Does Fahtaff ever denominate his Prince 'Abby, or call
him'Ax?
Moreover, the Jacobins and Levellers plead that really, in early
days, the use of the aspirate, which had still earlier prevailed, was
dying out, just as it "has died out in French, Spanish, Italian, and
Greek." And, probably, thinks the author of the "plea" above-
mentioned, avowing himself "Aw Arrcn Dboppeb," a very good
job too. It had better, suggests this pleader for degeneracy, die out
in all England also, as well as inside of Cookneydom. The enforce-
ment of "this shibboleth of gentility " is intolerable to that ultra
Radical. He therefore cries:—
"Oh, do kindly take this incubrous from our minds and lungs, and we
shall breathe more freely, and be grateful. What I ask for is compromise.
Let aspiration be retained for elocutionary purposes if you like, but let us
not be troubled with this affectation at our counting-house's and firesides."
"This affectation" and "this incubrous" mean the same thing,
the incumbency of aitcb.es. It is not at all obvious that'' incubrous"
is a misprint. An incubus isn't an affectation, although, in the
sense of nightmare, it may affect the lungs and the mind.
Sir, I trust that the whole Constitutional Party, whether Liberals
or Tories, will unite as one man in opposing an agitation opening
a disloyal crusade against the Queen's English. Its commencement
is clearly the thin end of the wedge, which, when driven home, will
confound v and to, singular and plural, and deprive present par-
ticiples of their final g, besides making the double negative compul-
sory—and that all in the sacred name of British liberty of speech!
Absit omen, menacing as it appears to Yours truly,

AN OXFORD (STREET) GREEK PLAY.
The raison d'etre of Clito, an original Tragedy, written in (I
believe) blank verse, by Messrs. Grundy and Barrett, seems to me
to have been a desire on the part of the authors to suit Miss East-
lake with a part similar to the one written for Sarah Bernhardt
by Victobeen Sabdou, without having recourse to the facile expe-
dient of translating or adapting Sardou's drama of Theodora. There
is also a touch of Sheeidan Knowles's Virginius in itt and the
whole strikes me as the work of men who had first devised situations,
mainly founded upon what was most effective in Thiodora, and then
worked up to them.
I will first oonsider the play, afterwards the acting; for unless the
intention of the authors is thoroughly comprehended, criticism on the
representation of their drama is thrown away. What then did the
authors mean the public to understand by their "original tragedy"
of Clito t I may take it that the performance at the Princess's
fairly represents their meaning, because they have not protested that
it does not, and one of them plays the hero. The play being unpub-
lished, I can only arrive at the authors' intention through the actors'
interpretation, and if these are false media it is not my fault should
my deduction not be exactly what the "Gbundy-Babbett"
combination—(telegrammicolly abbreviated into "Grabbett" or
"Babtjndy")—would desire me to draw. If a play iapublished, I
can study it, form my own idea of it, and judge the performance by
that standard: which standard is itself fairly open to criticism. But
to me the performance of Clito is its publication: its representation
by actors is a reading aloud of the text; "the reader, as the old

play-books used to have it, "being supposed to be on the stage
facing the audience," and the performance is the text illustrated—
and Here I may say if it were illustrated with a few more " outs,"
such an operation, in any new edition, would be of considerable
benefit to the tragedy.
If, then, it was the intention of the authors to represent an aban-
doned female character, worse than Theodora and viler than Datjdet's
Sapho, to dress up,
fv 7N in the garb of classic
/ '- V/ Greece, B.C. 404, the
kind of shameful
story that formed a
part of the hideous
revelations which the
Pall Mall Gazette,
last year, deemed
necessary to publish
for the benefit of
society at large and
to hasten forward the
amendment of the
criminal law,—then
they could not have
gone a better way to
work than in con-
Clito the Grecian Sta- structing the plot of
tuesque Sculptor, of the Clito, and represent-
RoamingNoseandWan- ing on tho stage the

wolfish, unsatiated
sensualist Glaucias, and his lamblike, innocent victim, the "Maid of
Athens," under seventeen at all events.
If the authors intended Clito, the celebrated sculptor, to be a
weak, self-conceited, impressionable, prosy individual, so ignorant
of the world around him, bo careless about the models which should
feed his art, that he has not made himself acquainted with the form
and features of an openly notorious character like the courtesan
Helle, who lives in a palace and reigns as a Princess in Athens,—if
the authors meant their Clito to be a self-deceiver, who, when most
in earnest, is unable to distinguish between real love and animal
passion, until the creature he has worshipped no longer dissembles
her love but kicks him down-stairs, having previously given him
"what for" in the best classio Billingsgate,—if they meant this,
then "BARUNDr" are to be congratulated on the performance of
Mr. Wilson Barrett as Clito, for the existence of a more contemptible
creature than he makes him appear can scarcely be imagined even
by himself and his partner. And this is a compliment to the actor's
art, for the better Mr. Barrett's performance, the worse it is for the
character he represents. So also for Miss Eastlake. I have never
seen her more powerful than
when, in the fourth Act, she
spurns Clito; perfectly agree-
ing with her in her opinion
of Clito, I was so struck
by the amazing energy of her
vividly realistic performance,
that I applauded her most
heartily. This was a tribute
to her art, for, if "Barundt"
intended their Helle to be a
coarse, utterly heartless,
fiendish "Wanton; without one
solitary redeeming quality,
then they must be sincerely
grateful to the actress, who,
whatever may be her private
opinion of the part, has sur-
rendered her judgment to
theirs, and has thoroughly em- , ,

of this detestable character. 1 d make two of ?™ day!
What Theodora did, as far as Andrfas is concerned, she did for
love; what Helle does to Clito, she does for hate. _ The two plays
are very close in their resemblance, except the motive. The plot of
Theodora is strong; this of Clito, without comparing it with Theo-
dora, is weak.
The character of Glaucias, as well played by Mr. Willabd as I
suppose it could be by anyone, is idiotic in action and brutal in idea.
Xenocles, professor of sculpting, is an old fool, who rates Clito soundly
for his conduct, and then speaks of him as " a great man fallen,"
After he has passed a week in riotous living in Helli's palace, at,
J* far as he knows, Helle"1! expense, after he has betrayed his
friends, and after he has handed over Xenocles' daughter—his own
foster-sister—to the tender care of the woman whose atrocious
character the minute before has been laid bare to him I WhVi for

"What! you think

The Monster Glaucias. 11 Fe
fi fo fum! Where is the Maid
this helpless, cringing, mean-spirited cur there cannot be one atom
of pity, still less of respect.
As to the dialogue—whether blank verse or not—it may be good
for "Barundt," Dut it is decidedly not up to what, away from
blank verse, I recollect of Grundy.
The repartees are of the schoolboyish
tu quoque order—which is Latin, not
Greek,—and among the poetic similes
are some good old friends, though I
doubt whether, in "the cat and canary"
") one, the "Barundt" are correct in
supposing that the Greeks knew much
about canaries.
But—pace the authors—it does occur
to me, that if Sarah Bernhardt had
:>layed Helli, and had insisted on giving
ler own interpretation of their mean-
ing, and if an audience had seen the
diaphanous and lithesome Sarah wind-
ing herself round Clito, purring to him,
wheedling him, posing to him in care-
less artistic fashion, and giving us brief
"asides " full of the deadliest purpose,
of AthensI Where is that jolt WOuld not we—we men, at least—have
morceaud croqutr? I must sympathised with Clito, while owning
eat ner. that such a woman, apparently so feeble,
so frail, and so fond, would have made a fool of any one or us, if we
had once the misfortune to fall into the clutches of such a dangerous
syren? Could anyone be more of the gutter than Sarah, when Theo-
dora, disguised, goes to see her old friend the sorceress r Could any-
one be more fiendish than Sarah, when she hears Marcellus's
confession, and stabs him ere he can utter her lover's name? And
could anything be sweeter, more
loving and coaxing than her
manner when she was toying
with Andreas f And as Fedora
in the closing scene—not Theo-
dora—could any remorse be more
thrilling than hers, in that last
death-struggle with the lover, of
whose life she has been the ourse.
There is a fifth Act of Clito,
intended to give Miss Eastlake
the sort of chance that Sarah
fenerally has in similar plays;
ut though she does all she can
to make it terrible, the motive
is wanting, and all interest in
the play is over. Better for the
pair of them had they both ended
their lives with the other prin-
cipals in the meUe at the end of Xenocles the Seulptor, and respected

And England with divisions sore perplexed,
A welcome lull here intermits the war,
And parting clouds show the returning Star.
Astrj:a, hail! Saturnian times no more
Make gay our wealthy or make glad our poor;
Praise of our Golden Age no more resounds,
Nor jubilation at Trade's leaps and bounds.
The leaden incubus, Depression, still
Our power oppresses, and obscures our skill.
Rise, Star of Hope! Our freer days refuse
The flatteries of the Dedicatory Muse,
Which marred the manhood e'en of Glorious John.
Yet, welcome! Now Astr.ea shines upon
Her people once again, may hope not deem
There is some quickening influence in the beam?
London in yon vast hall has seen that ray,
It is the turn of Liverpool to-day.

Of Southern skies or Western, jewel-flights
Of unreluctant satellites, attend

As in young Joseph's dream, bend unconstrained.

But by attraction, circle happily.

You and its flowers combine to give it fame),

May Fate's black shadow ne'er eclipse its light.
May sullen clouds that now o'ercast our sky,
Chased by the rising dawn of fortune fly;
Our Empire, with united interest blest,
In power and mutual love And prosperous rest;
At home the hateful feuds of Party cease.

The true ABtrasa for whose late return
All wise souls watch, all patriot spirits burn.

NOTES OF MUSIC.
Ma. Vladimir de Pachmann gave his "fourth and last" piano-
forte recital on May 3. St James's Hall was crowded with his
admirers, and with some in whom the performance excited less admi-
ration than amusement. Why will these pianists be so affected?
Pachmann sits at the piano, discoursing the most difficult music,
with his head turning this way and that, as much as to say: "You
see! this is mere ohild's play to me I" And then, after striking a
chord on the instrument (and in his sympathisers' breasts), he will
throw up his hands high above his head. But he does not throw up
the game: oh, dear no! down he comes again exactly on the right
note, and perhaps one of the most annoying things about him is that,
while he plays fast and loose with the piano, he never by any chance
plays a wrong note. What are you to do with a man like that? In
a pleasantly selected programme of good music, containing a sonata
by Chopin, of whom ne is perhaps one of the best living exponents,
Mr. Pachmann did not forget to introduce a composition, presumably
by " self and wife." True to the "cult" whioh gives us '' Schcbert-
Iausiq," and other hybrid composers, the concert-giver ascribed
some very pleasing " Variations on a theme," to " Pachmann-Okey."
Miss Maggie Obey was a musician before she became a wife, and so
far as I could judge the joint production was quite O.K.
Beethoven s Choral Symphony was performed at the first
Richter Conoert of the present series. This lengthy work consti-
tutes by itself a respectable allowance of music for one evening, but
space was found for other things, including a rhapsody, by Liszt,
and some selections from Waonkb. The letter's Siegfried " Idyll
was perhaps the most generally acceptable item in a programme
that contained no novelty. Mr. Otto Fisher sang the somewhat
tedious music allotted to Ham Sachs in a scene from Die Meister-
tinger, and the Richter Choir obliged with the Choruses. The last
part of the Choral Symphony requires a vocal quartette, and Miss
Hamlin was fortunately able to lean a little upon Miss Lena Little,
while Mr. Winch naturally proved useful to Mr, Fisher. But in
Riohter Concerts the Band 's the thing, and, though there was some
singing, the Entertainment was throughout quite orchestral, or, as a
bird-fancier might write it. kite, hawk, kestrel.
On May 6th Prince's Hall was devoted to " chamber " music, with
Madame Frickenhaus as pianist, and Herr Josef Ludwig as princi-
pal violinist. Modern musio was worthily represented by the works
of Dvorak, Raff and Gade, while the name of Beethoven lent
solidity to the bill of fare. Beginning with a trio for pianoforte,
violin, and violoncello, and ending with an octett for stringed instru-
ments, it will be seen that this concert was not intended for any but
real lovers of sound musio. It was no joke, but a rich treat. Herr
Ludwig, both as a soloist and as leader in concerted pieces, mani-
fests not only a complete mastery of his instrument, but also a digni-
fied and conscientious love of music for music's sake, that is none too
common. His execution is brilliant, and practically faultless, one
obvious reason being that he holds himself and his riddle properly.
Lots of fiddlers I besides the blind ones in the streets) don't.
The Crystal Palace Management raised public expectation, and the
prices of admission to the concert-room, when Gounod's Redemption
was recently performed. But one concert in which this splendid
work is given is worth more than a dozen ordinary ones, the con-
cluding chorus, with its gorgeous harmony and magnificent march
of counterpoint, being alone worth " double the price paid for admis-
sion." That is, of course, if you care about music as opposed to
drawing-room ballads by ignorant amateurs. Why don't we hear
it oftener? It would come as a boon and a blessing to men-ny
besides Nibbelunglet.
M. Lago can't start his Opera at Covent Garden without a prima
donna, and Path has refused to be, as Mr. Wagstaff immediately
and so happily observed, '\La Donna del Lago." But with such
weather for al fresco entertainments, and with such counter attrac-
tions—Bar, shop, and counter-attractions—as are offered by the
Colinderies, is there much chance for an Operatic venture this season?
"I say, No."

His constituents a little restive at

On the whole, remarkable Sitting.
Everybody in best of humours.
Henry Fowr.EE compliments Grand

Fowxeb. Money is voted by the
bushel; only hitch on the Scotch
Votes. Barclay says Scotch Members
understood they would be postponed. "Never heard of Buch a
thing!" says tne Lord Advocate, forgetting, in excitement of the
moment, to take off his hat. Hitch only temporary. More Votes
passed, half-a-dozen Bills advanoed a stage, and the forty Members
adjourned, with the consciousness of having done their duty.
Business done.—Trenormous!
Tuesday.—Gladstone back again, eagert intense,
and younger than ever. Walked from Downing Street
at rate of five miles an hour. Hardly breath to answer
Beach's question about Greece. On as soon as Ques-
tions were over, to meet Cabinet Council. "That,"
said A. Brown, who appropriately represents Welling-
ton in House of Commons, is what I call a hard day's
work. Leaves Hawarden Castle before luncheon; tra-
vels all afternoon; rushes down to House; goes to wrestle
with colleagues in Cabinet Council, and afterwards
correspondence. That's too much for anyone. Must
draw the line somewhere."
"Then I'll draw it at you," says our Artist.
And here it is.
After Questions, Macfablane brought on Motion
relating to poor man's tobacco. Seems it's chiefly
composed of water, which is unsatisfactory. Henby
Fowler—"ono of the successes of Gladstone's
Ministry," as the Sage of Queen Anne's Gate says
—declares there's no article of consumption in this
country more free from adulteration than tobacco.
"The average ounce contains only thirty-five per
cent, of moisture." That was evidently another
thing; Macfablane had represented this per-
centage as water. House, resenting attempt at
misrepresentation, negatived Motion without fur-
ther discussion.
After tobacco, opium. Pease appropriately in-
troduced the poppy, denouncing its cultivation in
India. Natural effect followed. Few Members
present. Set themselves, at the outset, to enjoy
speech. Gradually the influence of opium spread. Eyes closed,
heads drooped, and Members slept. Some stole away in search of
couches. Sir Richard Temple, breaking the long silence, momen-
tarily roused the sleepers with strident voice. Fowler, ex-
Lord Mayor, generously seconded his effort. But the voices had a
far-away sound. Sir George Campbell, moved to emulation by
Temple and Fowler, tried his voice, which effectually woke the

A. Brown Btudy.
Speaker, who, perceiving there were only twenty-nine Members in
the House, Counted it Out.
Business done.—None.
Wednesday.—Seemed as if there was to be no House at all to-day.
Speaker hung about till quarter-past Twelve before taking the
ohair. Then sat there quarter of an nour. Members dropped in one
by one.
"Will look in again by-and-by," said Spicer, nodding in
friendly way to Sergeant-at-Arms, and attempting to leave the
House. "Oh no you won't," said the Sergeant, drawing his sword.
"You suis and you reste."
Member for South Islington returned to his "seat, where it was
explained to him that when, on Wednesdays, Member has once
entered House, he cannot leave till quorum is formed.
House once made, went to work at tremendous pace. By Four
o'Clock had cleared off all the Bills on the Orders, advancing many
by a stage. "This is how it will always be when we are gone,1
said Sexton, in speech of unusual brevity. "You'd better
pass the Home Rule Bill right off, and get along with your own
affairs."
Business done.—Prodigious!
Thursday.—General Woodall, Surveyor-Gene-
ral of the Ordnance, home just in time. Been occu-
d during the so-called holidays in inspecting
forts. "And how are they?" said General
Fraskr, confidentially. "Are your forts
pretty fortey, as they say in France?"
"I must ask you to give notice of that
question," said the brother warrior.
Lord George Hamilton wants to know
about the bursting of the gun on the Col-
lingwood: addresses his question to the
"Surveyor-General of the Audience,"
a happy slip, whioh calls to mind Jacob
Bright's noble lord, the Member for
Woodcock." This the only flash of the
evening, otherwise spent decorously,
not to say dully in discussion of Rail-
way and Canal Traffio Bill. This Bill,
read Second Time, formed reasonable
amount of progress for one sitting.
But House insatiable. Took up Crofters
Bill and passed it on for Third Reading,
dealing with other measures before it
rose at a quarter past two.
Business done.—Astounding!

leries over the clock have, like the
House itself, been comparatively empty.

Beresford Hope, attempted to avoid
defeat by moving Adjournment of

By two to one, the minority almost

ment refused, and Bill withdrawn.

his way down the Gallery steps, " things
are oddly changed. In my time it was
the Tories that used to gather in defence of

thank the Radicals for preserving Grey-

Pretty to see Dtjff watching the sha-

_ Scientific Sage. Oh, confound it, you can't
kill everybody, don't you know.
Simple Savage. It seems to me that you
cannot make sure of killing anybody, except,
frhaps, your gunners. And that being so,
fail to see the use of your stultified
scientific skill, or your uncertain arms of
precision.
TO AN ANONYMOUS ONE.
One day last week, a spiteful letter signed
"Quis" was allowed to appear in the
Standard; and ,in order that the person at
whom its sneers were directed should not
miss seeing it, this letter was cut out and
sent to him, privately, by that pest of
society, that skunk of skunks, the Anony-
mous Correspondent. The answer to the
interrogative "Qtris P" in these cases,
usually is "A Rejected Contributor." Be
this as it may, we can make a shrewd guess
as to his identity. It does not need a very
sharp nose to detect a skunk.

ROBERT AT THE COLINDERIES."
S I have offen
sed it afore, bo
I says it now,
and I dessay I
shall continue
saying it to the
hend of the
Chapter, that
Wariety is
charming, and if ever even an
Hed Waiter had the hopportunity
\ of enjoying it to its werry fullest
\ extent, I am him, and the place is
here, and the time is now.
Luckily for me, I have been
from my werry hurlyest manhood
a good deal accustomed to the use
of ginerous drinks of werry wari-
ous kinds, say from umble Porter
up to the werry finest brans of
Shampane, so 1 was somewhat
prepared for the doom as awaited
me when I hentered this ome of
ospitality. If not, wot the conse-
qwences woud have been arter
about a fortnite of it, I dreds to
think, so I don't trubble myself to
do it.
And this is how it all append.
By sum remarkabel combynashun
of Buckemstances as I haven't yet
fathomed, one of the leading Col-
lonial Qents, struck probberbly
with my werry remarkabel res-
pectabel apearance, made a pint of
endevouring to: dishcover who I
was, and, after deddycating nearly
a hole our to the task, suckseeded,
and cumming up to me with one
of them Collonial smiles as is so
remarkabel captiwating, says to
me, says he, "Will you allow me,
Mr. Robert, to offer you a drink?" "Wot woud common sense as well as common kurtesy
sugest for a anser but, " Suttenly, Sir, you does me proud." And so we retired to a most
wunderfool Bar; where you can get amost everythink, and where, at his reckermendashun, I
partook of a drink that was quite new to me, and quite worthy of being hadded to my all-
reddy numerous list.
We had a most agreeabul and hinstructiv conwersashun while we drunk, principally con-
fined, as was nateral, to the propperest drinks as should go with the propperest meats, and I
don't hesitate to say, tho' I ardly expecs to be beleeved, that there was just one or too things
as he managed to give me a nint in as was worth remembring. He seemed to think as
how we spiled our pallets by too many kinds of wines. For hinstence, he said, wen I dined
with the Tailors (meaning the Merchant Taylors, pore fellah!) they gave me Punch and six
kinds of wine, and as they was all good, I drunk freely of all to show my respec for the
Washupf ul Company, and, would you beleeve it, he said, I had quite a leetle bit of an hed
ake next morning!
Well, the nex day my frend introdooced me to a frend of his from New South Whales,
and he asked me to have a drink, and I had it, but it was diffrent from the other and stronger,
and so on amost ewery day till I nose quite a lot of the nice generus fellows and drinks with
'em all quite willingly. There's one thing tho' as I must confess I coudn't quite manidge, and
that was the Horsetrailian Wine. I did try my werry best, as perliteness dicktated, to drink
a bumper of it without blinking, but I coudn't manage it, so I hegscused myself on the plee
of Indiagestion from heating Curry.
But even that isn't all, for one day one of the Ingian Princes, as I 3poso he was for he wore
a great big white Turbin on his ed, seeing me torking rayther effectionally to a yung Lady at
the Bar, came up to me, and shaking both of my ands said quite planely, Trinkee Trinkee?"
to which I replyed like a bird, "Yessee Yessee," and he spoke some gibberish to the yung
Lady, and she served us rite off with 2 pints of Pail Ale! and we drunk with our left ands
and snook ands with our rights, and then nodded our eds to one another like too grinning cats
from Chessher and so parted. That's wot I calls true Princely condecenshun, that ewen our
own elustrous Suns seldom stoops to.
Wot a wonderfool place is this here Exhibishun! I'm told as there's everythink in'it'as
the most fastiddeus peeple can possibly want, from the werry ighest to the werry lowest.
Ingian Shawls at two nunderd ginnys a peace and dinners at sixpence a head, and sad to tell
no small fee for the pore Waiters, witch is principally yung ladies. Of course, pussonally, it
ain't nothink to me, and such as me, as my occupashun is helsewheres, but I cannot shut my
ears to the sad fact. As my laber of love doesn't begin till the heavening, I has plenty of time
to wander about and wonder at all as I sees and hears. Praps the most strikinest thing of all
is the warious samples of the warious peeple of India. To think that them pore fellers with
their pore black or brown faces, and who praps never tasted reel Turtal in all their pore lives,
and woodn't know the difference between a salmy and a Ragoo, shood be of the same natur as
us who nose so much, ought praps to strike us with pitty, but I do bleeve as it's rayther
flattring to our fine old English wanity. Robert.

ATRABILIA.
(after "the cencl")
And did you once see Shelley's play?
And did you really sit it through?
Nor at the Tenth Act sneak away.?—
How strange it seems and new I
There are plays a many, mostly decent,
You'd feel no sense of nausea after;
I can't help wondering you were present—
My wonder moves your laughter?
I stopped at a book-stall in the City;
The name of the street I clean forget;
But the spot itself—the more's the pity-
Lives in my brain-pan yet.
For there I picked up, just to charm a
Minute away in mental quest,
A morbid drama, a nasty drama!
Well—I prefer the rest.
AN UNEXPECTED HONOUR.
(An altogether Imaginary Romance.)
Scene— The Platform upon which a State
Ceremony connected with a great Public
Undertaking is fixed to be held. Muni-
cipal Dignitaries discovered surrounding
Originator of the Scheme, and offering
him their congratulations.
First Municipal Dignitary. Such an
honour has not been paid the town these
twenty years. You will receive a baronetcy
at the very least.
Originator (aside). Keep still, my heart!
Lie down, ambitious flutterer!
Second M. D. A baronetcy! Bah! A
seat at the Privy Council, at the very least!
Third M. D. Pooh !—a Peerage!
Originator. Indeed, Gentlemen, in your
thoughts you do me too much honour! My
deserts are few. It is true this grand build-
ing—these magnificent exhibits—would not
be here had it not been for my poor efforts.
But what of that? Virtue—nay, industry
—is its own reward!
First, Second, Third, and Fourth M.D.'s.
(together). No, no, a Peerage—at least a
Baronetcy.
\_Thcir voices are drowned in a flourish
of trumpets.
Enter grand Procession of Royalty. Im-
posing ceremony. Reading of Address
by Originator. Gracious reply.
"Hallelujah Chorus" by the Choir and
Organ. Ecclesiastical speechification.
More singing.
Originator. Dear me! Well, it is excel-
lent; and if the predictions of my friends
—the Peerage—well, a coronet would cer-
tainly. Eh? What are they doing? Why
is that military-looking old Gentleman
drawing his sword, and—eh?—what? I
amtokneel? Why? Eh?
\lle is assisted to kneel. Martial cere-
mony. The sword is used, and returned
to its owner. Loud applause. More
music. Orand March. Exeunt
Royalties.
Originator (who has been dazed for a
quarter of an hour, gradually regaining
recollection). The Peerage! The Baronetage!
Oh, horror! Knighted!!! [Faints.
In Plat and Earnest.—The Volunteers
have long ceased to be taunted with "play-
ing at soldiers." But they do play at war,
and that so good a game that even Bismarck
and Von Moltke might commend their
Kriegspiel.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MOAN OF THE MUDDLED MEMBER.
Oh, how are we standing? Is Discord disbanding
Our host into atoms? It's like a bad dream.
I've nourished a hearty allegiance to Party,
I've found it delightful to slide with the stream.
But now we 're all scattered, our phalanx is shattered.
There isn't a stream, we've cross-currents all round;
To choose one's direction requires circumspeotion,
For who can tell whither its course may be bound P
I'm in for Mid-Slopton, a seat that I popped on
Because it pulled always one way at the poll.
I got into clover: but that is all over.
This blessed Home Rule puts us all in the hole.
There's no one opinion has certain dominion
Within my constituents' minds—or in mine,
And whither we 're going I feel there's no knowing,
And where we may get to I cannot divine.
It once was so easy with eloquence breezy
To rouse them to cheers for our own Grand Old Man,
And then, in neat phrases, to follow with praises
Of Birmingham's pet. There's an end to that plan,
For nobody knows if it's William or Joseph
Is going to win now they 're hotly opposed,
And what I've to think of, their fight on the brink of,
Is where shall I be when the combat is closed?
The old Sun is getting fast on toward setting,
The young Sun is rapidly rising to noon.
Well, what if I follow the younger Apollo?
A question, of course, I must settle, and soon.
But then, what if Gladstone should best hit the Rad's tone?
And what if the Bads get the pull at the polls?
Which t« the right Phoebus P It's worse than a rebus,
It dazes our wits and it saddens our souls.
If he of the orchid won't stand any more "kid,"
From even the Old Parliamentary Hand,
But sits upon Mobley and squelches him, surely
There'II be a rare shindy all over the land.
But if the old Sun God should prove England's one god,
And John should liok Joseph, why, where are we then?
They 'd never find pardon who ratted from Hawarden,
And bothered the grandest and wisest of Men.
And yet if Young Brummagem really become a gem,
Shining in brightness alone, and supreme;
If .though they are sweetish upon the old fetish,
The Liberals find his last venture extreme;
If Popery bogies and Whiggish old fogies
Should, frighten the voters all over to Joe,
And I am not in it, you '11 see in a minute
That won't suit my book; most decidedly no t
And then there's the Caucus—I wish it at Orcus—
It may have a voice which may not match with mine.
The men of Mid-Slopton already have dropped on
Their Member for slowness in toeing the line.
In short it's a puzzle. The whip and the muzzle
Are capital things when they 're held by one hand,
But even a poodle of Party's best brood 'II
Rebel at cross-orders he can't understand.
DIARY OE A COLONIAL COMMISSIONER.
Monday.—Really since Mr. Atjgustt/s Harbts set the excellent
fashion of entertaining us, the hospitality has grown almost oppres-
sive. Was a teetotaller when I left Australia. Obliged to give all
that up. Might cause offence. Engagements for this day. Lunch
with Bishop of London. Ditto with Managers of Publia Banks.
Ditto with Managers of Private Banks. How I shall eat the nine
dinners to which I am invited, I cannot possibly say? However that
may be, I shall certainly take supper with Mr. Henry Ibvtng.
Tuesday.—Rather shaky. Yesterday seemed to be eating and
drinking from morning to night. How shall I manage the dejeuners
with the Lord Mayor, Council of the Royal College of Surgeons, and
Directors of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, I can't say.
Manage pretty well now with my dinners. For instance, to-day I
shall take my soup with Lord Rosebeby, fish with Drapers' Company,
entries with the Directors of the London General Omnibus Company,
the Trustees of the British Museum, and Mr. T. H. Bolton, M.P.,
representing the Directorate of the Royal Westminster Aquarium.
The other hosts must be satisfied if I turn up with the sweets, or at
dessert. Shall certainly look in for supper with Henry Ibvtng.
Wednesday.—This is the second time I have not been to bed—two
days consecutively 1 Supper with Ibving most delightful. To-day's
arrangements, six luncheons, twelve dinners. Well, I 'think I can
piece them in somehow. The only thing that bothers me is how I can
catch a "champagne tea" with Mr. William Holland at the Royal
Albert Palace, and'' late breakfast'' with the Surveyor-General of the
Ordnance, at Queen Anne's Mansions, at one and the same moment.
After dinner engagements I shall look in at Henry's for supper.
Thursday.—Another day without any rest! Don't know how I
shall stand it! Really very tiring, but haven't time for bed. Saw
famous doctor, who advised me only to eat—not to drink. Glad of
this, as formerly was a teetotaller, and since I have been going about
I am afraid I have been seeing blue rats. Don't like this symptom,
as delirium tremens is hereditary in my family. However, no
more rats—only food. See how I shall manage my twenty-seven
engagements. Can't refuse to take supper with old Irving.
Friday.—Dead beat. No time for bed. Worn to a shadow. Saw
another oelebrated doctor last night (met him in company with Car-
dinal M-nn-ng, Mr. S-m-r-8 Y-NE, the Duke of C-mbb-dge, Mr.
Wh-stl-b, the artist, Sir Arth-r 8-ll-v-n, Mr. D'Oyly C-bte,
the Rev. C. H. Sp-bg-n, the Rajah of J-h-be, and Mr. J. L. T-le,
in the Beefsteak Room at the Lyceum), and he told me that, to get
through all my engagements, I should never eat; only drink. Shall
try it. Thirty-three engagements for to-day! Well, shall take
advice. No eating all Sunday. Must remember that I have made
appointment for supper with Habey Ibving.
Sat'day. —Y'y rtigued! Shall gotobedinboots!
PERIODICAL MUSIC.
At this season of the year there is quite an epidemic of small after-
noon and evening concerts given at private houses, "kindly lent for
the occasion," or at the smaller halls. These entertainments are
usually announced as Mr. So-and-So's Annual Reoital, or Madame
Thingumy's Matvnie Musicale, and are mostly designed solely for the
pecuniary advantage of those who get them up. There is a large
number of artiste—or artistes as they generally insist on being styled
—who appear to have nothing else to do but oblige one another.
"You sing for me at my concert, and I will play for you at yours,"
expresses the kind of mutual understanding which subsists, and
accordingly when you go to Lady Bobeall's to hear Signor Mac-
caboni's afternoon concert, you may make pretty sure that much the
same combination of performers will be similarly engaged elsewhere
next week, only that the bineficiaire will be Signor Spabghetti or
Mile. Yertigo. The amount of canvassing that goes on for the sale
of guinea tickets for a selection of music not worth eighteenpence—
and bad business for the speculator at that—is quite surprising; and,
however galling the truth may be, the fact remains that in many, if
not most, drawing-room concerts the tickets are bought rather out of
weak good-nature, or pure benevolence, than from a conscious desire
to be present. Music is thus put upon an undignified footing, while
its professors come to be regarded as bores, and contributions to their
benefits as a species of poor-rate. This state of things is all wrong.
Among important events in the London musical world is to be
olassed the production by Richter of Brahms's fourth and latest
Symphony. As usual, the majority of newspaper oritics preserve
a tentative attitude, and, after muoh highly-coloured padding, are
unanimous in the brilliant conclusion that the new work will strike
different people differently. It is doubtless difficult to explain to
others what is double-dutch to the would-be expositor, but it is
absurd to speak of Brahms as departing from the form of the
symphony as stereotyped by Haydn, and developed by Beethoven,
when every practical musician should know that, however Berlioz
and Liszt may have "rhapsodised," Brahms is par excellence of
modern musicians, the truest in his allegiance to classical structure.
This appears to have been realised on the programme by C. A. B. in
his somewhat loose analysis of the first movement of the new
Symphony, though he carefully hedged himself behind high-sound-
ing generalities after his remarks upon the concluding allegro.
The entire work was played under Richter—who conducted with
masterly judgment ana without the notes—in a way that no other
Director known to English audiences could have approached. Its
beauties were brought out, the gradations of expression finely inter-
preted; the splendid symphony, ablaze with colour, and embroidered
with subtlety, marched magnificently to the very end, delighting
those hearers who welcomed an oasis of sound music amid the
howling wilderness of trivial and disheartening balderdash with
which their ears are too often assailed. Miss Lena Little gave
three songs by Liszt, with orchestral accompaniment. These were
the Abbe s settings of Goethe's " Mignon," Heine's " Lorelei," and
Lenatt's "Three Oipsies." Like much of Liszt's music, they
appear to be rather improvisations than considered efforts, and, con-
sequently, unsatisfactory when divorced from associations of time
and place. Miss Little sang in German, and consistently pro-
nounced such words as "nicnt," "ion," and "mich," as "nisht,"
"ish," and " mish." M.y Governess used to tell me this was wrong.
But I musht not write too mush. Nibbelunglet.

PYGMALION AND GALATEA.
(Showing that History has a tendency to repeat itself.)
SAUCE FOR THE GANDER.
Being Two Successive Readings from Possible Contemporary History.
"Ulster will not be a consenting party. Ulster, at the proper moment,
will resort to the supreme arbitrament of force. Ulster will light. Ulster
will be right."—Lord Randolph Churchill.
CHAPTER THE LAST BUT ONE.
Ulster had refused to be a consenting party. The proper moment
had, in her judgment, arrived, and she had resorted to the supreme
arbitrament of foroe. For some months advertisements had appeared
in the local papers, inviting tenders now for twenty, now for forty
thousand rifles, and had been liberally responded to. Drill-sergeants
not in receipt of pay from Her Maiesty's Government haa been
applied for, and came in shoals. All had been a scene of the wildest
activity. But now came a check. A message had come from the
Vioeroy to the effect that the Queen's troops would answer for the
safety of the country, and that unauthorised armament of the whole
civic population was not countenanced officially by the Authorities at
the Castle. The reply of the Loyal and Patriotic League was charac-
teristic, and to the point. It told his Excellency to whistle for it,
and mind his own business. Nor was this all. Words were soon
followed up by acts. The General commanding the Royal forces
disappeared suddenly, nobody knew where. The barracks were
seized upon in berry, and the arms and ammunition confiscated. A
similar ruse succeeded at Belfast. The Queen's troops, though
surprised there at night, made some show of resistance, Dut, owing
to the desertion of their officers en masse, were obliged to yield, and
were conveyed in gangs as prisoners to the borders of Connaught,
and there set free. The Viceroy remonstrated by a proclamation in
the Queen's name. It was publicly defaced. The Union Jack was
hauled down, and the Orange flag of the Loyal and Patriotic League
run up> in its place. Everywhere the evidence that the party
had detied alike the majority of their fellow-countrymen and the
majesty of Parliament was visible. Kentish fire echoed from a
hundred enthusiastic meetings at night, and swinging battalions
marched to the music of" lioyne Water, and the snouting of " No
surrender!" by day. It was felt by one and all that Ulster was strong
enough to defy the Empire, and she revelled in her strength.
CHAPTER THE LAST.
• •••*•
A harked change had now come upon the scene." The resolution
of the rest of the country that it would not be dominated by an
aggressive faction, was no sooner formed than it took shape in action.
It was felt that the game that could be played by a minority con-
sisting of but a bare fourth of the nation could be essayed with at
least equal chances of success by the remaining three-fourths. And
the feeling was not long in bearing fruit. Arms poured in hourly
from America. The drill-sergeant soon followed, and in field and
on hill-side the rival training went on apace. Soon the regiments
were equipped, and started from the soil as if by magic. Nor was
their enthusiasm behind that of their opponents. The harp of Ire-
land was raised aloft, and the " Wearing of the Green " echoed over
vale and glen, through town and village, till the very children sang
it at their play. Then came the day when all was ready and the
word was given to advance. Forward swept the National tide to
accept in its turn " the supreme arbitrament of force."
• •••••
The battle had been severe, but it was over at last. Belfast was
taken. Kerry was in ruins. Everywhere the Orange faction had
been outnumbered and worsted. The reverse was crushing and com-
plete. '' We shall now," said the General, commanding the National
forces, "be suffered, perhaps, to hold our Parliament on College
Green, in peace." He turned to a batch of captured officers as he
spoke. They were a motley erew. Among them figured several
wearing the Queen's uniform, while here and there stood some dis-
tinguished sympathiser with the beaten cause, who had thrown in
his lot to support rebellion against Qcekn and Empire. Among these
latter a scion of a Ducal House and former well-known Member of
the House of Commons, was weeping over a broken drumhead. The
General singled him out, and beckoned him to approach. He drew
near, surlily. "Well, my Lord," continued the Commander, in a
tone of banter. "How about your propheoy. Ulster will fight.
Ulster will be right P Ulster has fought. Ha! ha!"
"And she has been wrong !" was the submissive and humble reply.
Tee "Schoolmasters' Congress."—Evidently another name for
The Coaching Club.

PAPERS FROM PUMP-HANDLE COURT.
CONCERNING A VERT PRESSING APPOINTMENT.
<|ilin«ii|UMiui

O U are
wanted im-
mediately
in Cham-
bers.—Por-
TINGTON,"
was the
brief tele-
gram that,
originally
sent to Bur-
mah Gar-
dens, followed me to
Felstead, near Little
Dunmow, a village
which has peculiar
charms to me from boy-
ish associations. The
message reached me on
a Saturday evening after
train-hours, so that it
was impossible for me to
take the iron-horse and
hurry back to my ex-
cellent and admirable
Clerk, to inquire the
reason of this rather
unusual demand for me.
On more closely exam-
ining the pink paper I
learned, to my sorrow,
that "I had been wanted
immediately," at 10-30
on that morning, and
consequently much
might have happened
since its receipt at
Pump - Handle Court.
I hurriedly secured a.Bradshaw, and found thattherewas no conveyance to London
to or from Felstead on Sundays, and that my only chance of reaching the great
Metropolis before Monday, was by walking to Chelmsford, and catching a train
there. I explained my trouble to my wife (who strangely enough had wished to
go to Paris for our little holiday, instead of Felstead), and received the cold com-
fort "that it couldn't be helped, but that was the way I was always losing my
chances." Need I say that the Sabbath was spent in sorrow and anxiety, while
I conjectured how much had been sacrificed by my too great partiality for a
glimpse into life in an Essex village, whose chief claim to distinction was that it
contained a county school of about the size of Winchester.
By the earliest train on Monday morning, I came up to town, and found my
Chambers tenanted by an elderly female sweeping them out, and preparing for
the toil of the coming forensic day. She regarded me with some suspicion as I
entered the room set aside for Portington, and began to search for evidence as
to whom had been asking for me. My quest was immediately rewarded by the
discovery of three pieces of paper bearing the inscriptions, respectively, of
"10'30,Messrs. Nodd and Smoler to see Mr. Briefless,"^'12, Noddand Smoler
to see Briefless." - "2, N. and S. to see B." Thus I ascertained that
Messrs. Nodd and Smoler (a firm of the very highest respectability) had
been no less than thrice to meet me on the preceding Saturday. I felt it was
useless to question the aged female as to their business, and considered it advisable
to immediately hurry to my club and communicate with them through the
telephone—choosing this course in preference to calling upon them in person as
less unprofessional than the alternative.
As ten o'clock was striking I entered the sort of cupboard where the latest
triumph of science is available at the Parthenon, and found out the number
of my new clients, and after a slight altercation with an invisible lady in charge
of the wires, who seemed to question my assertion that I had been ringing for
the last twenty minutes, was "put on' to them. My inquiry as to whether
Messrs. Nodd and Smoler were at home, was answered by a shrill and
Who was
earnestly,
equiously, "because I believed the Firm wanted to see me on a
matter of importance.
"Well," said the shrill and audacious youth, through the telephone, "I will
tell them what you say. Just wait a moment, while I speak to them."
I thanked the lad with effusion (courtesy through the telephone is so grateful),
and listened to his retreating footsteps. The next five minutes I employed in
imploring the invisible lady, "Not to cut me off, as I hadn't done speaking."
The invisible lady fortunately having a tender heart, continued the communication.
"Are you there?" cried the shrill and audacious youth, at last coming back,
and getting a reply from me in the affirmative, he continued, "They say they
are out at present, but will be glad to give you five minutes at eleven o'clock at
your Chambers."
The receiver was returned to its rest with a " ping."
and I knew I was " cut off" from the audacious youth,
it might be for years—it might be for ever.
I hurried from the Parthenon to Pump-Handle Court,
and at last found Portington, who explained to me that
Messrs. Nodd and Smoler had been to see me several
times on Saturday, and refused to speak to anyone else.
"They are very good people indeed, Sir," continued my
excellent and admirable Clerk, "and have a large agency
business. I shouldn't be surprised if they didn't want you
to do some of their Junior work in the Probate Division."
"Just so," I replied, with a glow at my heart which
sent the blood into my cneeks. Well, I am sure I shall
be very happy to act for them. They have never appeared
in my Fee-Book before, I think, Portington?"
"No, Sir; to the best of my recollection, they have not,"
responded my Clerk; "at least, not for some time."
Ihave already explained, on a previous occasion, that
I share my Chambers with a friend. That friend, with a
kindness I cannot sufficiently acknowledge, on learning
that I expected clients of so much importance as Messrs.
Nodd and Smoler insisted upon vacating his portion of
the rooms, so that it might appear that I was the [sole
possessor of the noble suite of two apartments and a cup-
board, which form together our joint holding.
Eleven struck in the belfry of the Inner Temple Library,
and there was a loud knock at our Chambers'-door. In
another minute the Representative of Messrs. Nodd and
Smoler was before me. He was an exceedingly intelli-
gent youth, but did not seem quite old enough to be a
member of the firm. However, on reflecting that some
of the most able and experienced Managing Clerks I have
come across have been, legally speaking, only just out-
side the term of "infants," I was not surprised at his
juvenility.
"Mr. Briefless, I think, Sir," began the young man.
"Certainly," I replied, courteously. "Pray take a
seat. I am sorry not to have been here on Saturday, but
I was called away to the country. I hope, however, I
have not inconvenienced you by my absence?"
"Oh, not at all, Sir—in fact, it will do just as well
to-day as Saturday."
"That's right;" I returned heartily, and settling my-
self in my favourite attitude of genial attention, I, with a
graceful gesture, invited him to explain his business.
"The fact is. Sir, Mr. Staunton, the Shoe-maker, is a
client of ours."
"Ah! really," I returned, smiling, "I am sure I shall
be very pleased indeed to do anything I can for him. I
have dealt with him for years—long before my marriage
—and so has my wife since our wedding. Very glad in-
deed to do anything I can for old Mr. Staunton. By the
way," I continued^ becoming grave, "not a Probate—
not dead? Eh? Dear me! Not dead, I hope?"
"Oh no, Sir, not dead," was the answer of the Repre-
sentative of Messrs. Nodd and Smoler.
"Not a Divorce either? Eh?" was my next guess.
"Young Staunton was (I am told) a little wild when his
father sent him up to Oxford, but not, Ihope, aDivorce?"
"Oh no, Sir, not a Divorce,"—and the Clerk fumbled
in his pocket as if in search of documents—" and that
reminds me, Sir. I suppose Mrs. Briefless has full
authority to act for you r
"Certainly," I responded, alittle surprised at the ques-
tion. Then I returned to my examination. "No doubt,
as I practise almost exclusively in the Probate Division,
you have come to me about some Admiralty business.
Hope none of the family while yachting have been run-
ning down a collier, or anything of that sort?"
"Oh no, Sir," replied the Clerk, who by this time had
found the document he had been searching for. "This
will explain everything." And he handed me a paper.
Nodding my head at him in a manner which I intended
should suggest that, after all, written instructions were
infinitely superior to verbal ones, I leisurely put my
double-eyeglasses on my nose and prepared to read what
he had set before me.
For a moment I could not believe my eyes! The dis-
appointment was too great to face! I could not bear it!
The Representative of Messrs. Nodd and Smoler (who
had left immediately after presenting me with the docu-
ment) had actually brought me all the way to town from
the country to serve me with a County Court summons
for the value of some children's boots that my wifo had
forgotten to pay for! I could not bear it f I broke
down! A. Briefless, Junior.

discovered I, the one thing wanting—The Alternative.
Through the appropriate mouth of the Hon. JonN Cosn-

12) the following amendment to an address to the Queen :—
"That this House earnestly hopes that such a measure, or such
measures, may be adopted by the Imperial Parliament as will,
while preserving the integrity and well-being of the Empire and
the rights and status of the minority, be satisfactory to the people
of Ireland and permanently remove the discontent so long un-
happily prevailing in that country."
"Hooray!" says Mr. Punch, and Amen! Carried
nem. con._ throughout the world: and the Liberal Party is
itself again. Nothing now remains but to take the obvious
and easy course of adopting such measure—or

THE MURMUR IN THE SHELL-EY SOCIETY.
The little passage of arms that has taken place in the pages of a
contemporary over the doings of the Shelley Society, has very
naturally suggested a question as to the raiton d'etre of that
apparently quite unnecessary body. Nor has the answer that has
been forthcoming turned out to be very satisfactory. "I decided,"
says a Dr. Fcrnivai.l, "on having the play at the same instant that
I resolved to found the Shelley Society—on the hill between Hendon
and Hampstead, on Sunday, December 4, about 1*30 p.m." _ Notwith-
standing the dramatic distinctness of the announcement, it must be
admitted, that it leaves the reader very much where he was, and in-
clined to ask with a writer, signing himself " H," who follows, who
on earth this "Dr. Fubnivall" is. "I do not," he says, "for the
moment, care twopence about Shelley's play, or about your criticism
upon it. I want to be told, for my own satisfaction, by whom the
gentleman is accredited who considers himself entitled to give the lie
of Billingsgate to a merely candid critic Is he Jupiter? or is he
only the beetle who carried the lightning under Jupiter's chariot."
We suppose we may answer, that the gentleman in question may,
in a certain sense, be regarded as both. For, as inspired founder
"on the hill between Hendon and Hampstead," of the Shelley Society,
he may certainly be looked upon as a sort of Jupiter to the institution,
while his descent to the use of Billingsgate in reply to a candid critic,
associates him in some measure with the discharge of the duties ful-
filled by the beetle under the chariot.
But perhaps it is hardly worth while investigating the matter. It
may be taken pretty well for granted, that from time to time some
suon eruptions of dilettanteism as that of which the Shelley Society
is an average specimen, are inevitable, and that whenever they occur
there will be a temporary upheaval of nobodies, who will, for a brief
moment, climb into prominence, and, covered with the tegis of the
name they invoke, attach a fleeting importance to themselves from
their association with the phenomenon. Of such sort of notoriety is
probably that attained by the self-constituted boss of the Shelley
Society. However, be this as it may, if we may judge from the
unprejudiced criticism passed upon the performance, it seems pretty
clear that it would have been much better let alone.
"For four mortal hours," writes a "member who was present,"
"we endured one long monotonous horror. . . . The actors and
actresses in the labour of love did all that could be done; but the
?lay is proved to be impossible, and so let us leave it in the hope
ihared Dy many of my fellow-members) that before another 'sixty
years' it will be possible to debate the matter calmly, but not to put
The Cenci on the Stage." The member may possibly have some
justification for the expression of his hope that The Cenci may not
again be thrust disagreeably to the front, but there is nothing to
save Society from simuar inflictions. Shelley may not be the craze
to-morrow, and it may not be possible to seize hold of material that
has the distinct dramatic advantage of being condemned by the
licenser, but who knows what votaries some lesser, if more decent,
lights may not command? Brownites. Smithites, and Robinsonites
are ready to succeed the displaced Shelleyites, for the dilettante crew
is inexhaustible, and prepared, like midges, to buzz about the first
name that comes to the front, be it Robinson, or Smith, or Brown.
We fear that the literary disease of which the " Shelley Society"
and its doings may be regarded as an exemplar, shows no signs
either of effacing itself or of being stamped out.

A THIN HOTJSE-BEFOBE DINNER.

ESSENCE OF PABLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 10.—Again a crowded House. The
Prince of Wales in the Gallery, and a dozen Members sitting on the steps of the
Gangway for lack of other accommodation. Majority of Members breakfasted at
home, but many lunched in House in order to secure places. Gladstone to move
Second Reading of Government of Ireland Bill, in parlous condition just now
owing to defections. But the Grand Old Word Conjuror was to put this all right.
Conservatives uneasy; Gladstonians triumphant; Chamberlainians ready to be
convinced; Hartingtonians sullen, and Peter-Rylandites apprehensive. As the
Speech went on over space of two hours the attitude of parties changed. Con-
servatives grew jubilant, Gladstonians despondent, Chamberlainians perplexed,
Hartingtomans light-hearted. Only the Peter-Rylandites remained under the
dark and immovable cloud of depression.
For once, at least, Gladstonk had made a failure. "Wearied and puzzled the
audience with half explained schemes and general mystification. Voice improved
as he went on. Rose to fullest eloquence and debating power in personal
references to Harttngton. But that a mere flash over a sandy waste or wordi-
ness. The customary cheers greeted his peroration, but when he sat down it
was felt that the battle was lost.
"Woe is me!" said the faithful Dillwtn, tears coursing down his furrowed
cheek, "that I should live to hear my chief make a speech that damaged his

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Tuesday.—A night of miscellaneous business in both Houses.
In Lords, interesting debate on Sunday Closing1 (Durham) Bill.
Marked by dramatic incident manceuvred by Bramwell. Bbamwell
had sent down to House by Parcels' Delivery a monster Petition
against Bill. Usual course quietly to present Petition as soon as
Lord Chancellob takes the Woolsack. Bramwell knew better
than that. Arranged with attendant to have the big roll in readi-
ness in the wings, and at the cuo " sixty thousand people living in
the county of Durham" roll it in. Threatened hitch owing to length
of Bishop of Durham's speech. The super in the wing fell asleep
before the close. Lord Dalhousie, passing out, regarded him with
astonishment. Nothing happening, Lord Bramwell, turning
towards the wing, repeated, at the top of his voice, "Signed by
upwards of sixty thousand people living in the county of Durham.
This woke up the super, who hurriedly rolled in the Petition amid
much cheering. But he '11 have a bad time of it when Bramwell
meets him.
In Commons, Howard Vincent brought forward question of the
closing against the public of various carriage-roads in neighbour-
hood of Buckingham Palace. Leveson-Gower condemned to recite
official answer. Restrictions, he said, been laid down in former
times. A pretty answer for a Government about to give Home Rule
to Ireland! Vincent gave notice to submit Resolution on the
subject. Shall second it myself. A monstrous thing in overcrowded
London to have some of the most convenient thoroughfares closed to
the public, who pay for their maintenance. Curious it should have
been left to a Conservative to raise this question.
"Pooh, pooh!" says the Sage of Queen Anne's Gate, "Vincent
isn't much of a Conservative. Was a Liberal before he journeyed
round the world, starting towards the West. Let him make the
journey again the other way about, and he '11 come back a
Liberal."
Business done.—Various.
Thursday.—Met Habtington in Lobby with bundles of paper
under his arm, and something like a scowl on his face. Dropped
one or two of the bundles as he went along. Called his attention to
circumstance. "Oh, never mind,"he said, petulantly. "One more
or less doesn't matter. Thought, when I left Ministry. I should
begin to have good time of it. Things worse than ever. Have to be
in my place almost as much as before. Expected to make important
speeohes. Get cheered by the Tories, and wept oyer by Gladstone.
Now come down to presenting Petitions. Begin to wish I had
stopped in the Ministry."
Burst of cheering from Tories when Habtington appeared with
his Petitions. Would have delighted an ordinary man. Habtington
more wrathful than ever.
General depression on Liberal side. Expectation of conciliation
reaching vanishing . point. Certain
SroBpectof defeat on Home-Rule Bill,
inly cheerful man on Liberal benches
is the Grand Old One. He laughs and
chats with Harcoubt
and John Morlet.
Couldn't be in better
spirits if he were cer-
tain of majority of 100.
House crowded again in
every part. Prince of
Wales in his old place
over the clock. Prince
Christian lends his ani-
mated presence to the
scene. Sir Henry James
leads off, referring in
lugubrious tones to the
relations between him-
self and Prime Minis-
ter. Orr-Ewing listens
to him critically.
"Worst of Henry
James as a speaker," he
said, "is his habit of
Mr. On-Ew-ng (Orr-Anytliingelse). propping into a funereal
6X . tone apropos of nothing.
You'd think, from the sound of his voice when he alludes to his Right
non. friend, that he was preaching Gladstone's funeral sermon."
Campbell-Bannebman followed. Rumoured he would make
things straight with Chomberlainites. But he said nothing fresh,
and Members went off to dinner with conviction that the Bill was
doomed.
Business done.—Adjourned debate on Second Reading Home-
Rule Bill.
Friday.—Often noticed behind Front Opposition Bench a gentle-
man about the height of Mr. Pickwick, with ruby face, and white
hair. Don't know his name. Never heard him speak. But to-night
came out, and made his mark. Sir W. Cunllffe Brooks, B.B.K.,
is his name, Cheshire his Constituency. It was Free Trade brought
him to the front. Position of to-night's business peculiar, and long
unfamiliar. Committee of Supply first order. Behind it was John
Mobley's Bill for re-enactment of Arms Act. Well enough when
directed against Parnellites. Now used in threat against Orone-e-
men, Ulster Members would
take care that it did not pass
in a hurry. So whole night
given up to talk till Half-past
Twelve struck, and Arms Bill
impossible.
Performance began with
motion by Jenning raising
Free Trade question. Brooks
seconded it. Began quietly
enough. Presently languid
House aroused by sudden
shout.
"We are bleeding to death I"
House looked up and beheld the
stout little gentleman with blood-
red face and white hair, shaking
his fist at the Speaker. Cheers and
laughter wound him up to higher
pitch.
"I am here," he shouted at the
top 'of his voice, " to knock down
the idol of the Cobden Club, called
Cheapness." House roared with
laughter for several moments, dur-
ing which Brooks stood with hand
still clutched, waiting for opportu-
nity to continue his remarks.
Cheapness!" he shouted, and the House broke into fresh laughter.
"Cheapness!" he roared again.
"I think I '11 hear the rest of this outside," said Lord Lymington.
passing down the floor with ambling grace. "Cheapness," said
Brooks, keeping up his voice, "is not the only desirable thing."
In another ten minutes had shouted himself out, and Members
merrily dispersed. Business done.—None.

Lord L-m-ngt-n.

AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE.
Mr. Criterion Wyndham has done a wise and plucky thing.
He had advertised The Circassian, and, at the last moment, with-
drew it, because, as he explained in print, at the dress rehearsal he
became convinced that the play, " however good in itself, was scarcely
yet in a condition for publio representation." 0 wise young judge!
—yes, "Young," for Charles the Second is always youthful, as
was that greater Chables, Chables Mathews. But, O si sic
omnes! would that all managers would follow his example, instead
of rushing a piece to almost certain death, simply because they have
advertised it for a certain day, by which date they know, as weU as
everyone about them knows, that it cannot be ready for performance.
First-night failures are frequently the result of a mistaken idea, on
the part of the manager, as to " keeping faith with the public." The
author has practically no voioe in the matter, and generally has
to yield his better judgment to what is represented to him as a
necessity. "The places are all hooked—the house is crammed for
the first night—the advertisements are all out—we're doing bad
business because the public are waiting for the new piece—it will be
simply a dead loss to go on like this," and so on—all these "argumenta
ad pocketum" are brought to bear on the diffident, protesting
author by "the management" of the theatre,—which title may in-
clude several people beside the responsible manager, whose name
appears on the bill,—and the author, recognising the fact that every-
thing in front of the house is ready, and hardly anything ready
on the stage, perfectly aware that the very best preparations have
been made for insuring a disastrous failure, reluctantly yields his
assent to the short-sighted policy of the theatrical government, and
entertaining a forlorn hope that, by some miraculously lucky chance,
the piece may, perhaps, disappoint his worst anticipations and succeed,
he goes in at the last moment to do all he can to save the fortunes of
the night.
The management takes the failure as part of the business—it is a
bad spec, and it tries another, and then another, and makes a hit
with one out of five, which soon recoups all previous losses. The
author, on tho other hand, has no such chanoe; on him falls all the
blame of failure and all its consequences. It is his child that
has been killed by the selfish cruelty of its guardians, and by his
own weakness in submitting to such treatment. Mr. Wyndham
deserves the thanks of all authors for setting this example to
managers; and we trust that when The Circassian does appear, it
will be "a big success."

ROOM FOR RUBINSTEIN!
Stand back, ye minor pianists, for awhile, and take a lesson!
Rubinstein, the finest player in the world, is with us once again.
His name has long
been a household
word in almost
every family that
possesses a piano;
and not to admire
Rubinstein is, in
some quarters,
even; a" more dan-
gerous heresy than
not to appreciate
Beethoven. The
"cycle" of seven
recitals, which was
inaugurated last
weekat St. James's
Hall, has already
created a. furore—
not to say a cy-
clone—in the prin-
, cipal capitals of
The Cyclone visiting England. Europe; so, at the
opening Concert, the short people at the back of the hall, and the
expectations of everyone present, were on tip-toe to get a first
glimpse of the cyclist. Such an enthusiastic greeting as Anton
Rubinstein received might well shake the mental equilibrium of a
lesser artist. But down ho sat, calm, self-possessed, impassible, to
begin the programme upon which, first and foremost in chrono-
logical order, stood the innocent strains of two Englishmen, Thomas
Bibb, and Dr. John Bull. The latter did not compose " God Save
the King "—a fact greatly to his credit.
Departed celebrities of every kind are said by historians to have
"flourished" at such and such a period. In a double sense is this
true of the earlier Composers, whose works betray a child-like ten-
derness for bird-like cnirrupings. They soothe the contemplative
mind, but do not excite the various emotions which it is the object of
the Moderns to arouse. Hence, the first concert was rather inter-
esting to the student, as illustrating the advance of pianoforte music,
via the virginal, the spinet, and the harpsichord, than impressive to
those among the audience who had passed their novitiate. Together
with BrRD and Bull, Scahlatti, Bach, Handel, Haydn, and
Mozabt were all disposed of at one sitting—summarily, as it might
at first sight seem. But then it must be borne in mind that the
reputations of the last four writers are principally associated with
the orchestra and music for the fiddle tribe. This is not surprising
when we reflect that the pianos available even in the days of Mozabt
were still most ungrateful instruments. The harmless and quaintly
graceful music was of course faultlessly rendered; and Handel's
variations upon "The Harmonious Blacksmith" were taken at a
pace which made many listeners " sit up."
Three Composers are, in the scheme of the series, honoured with a
concert to themselves. These are Beethoven, Schumann, and.Chopin;
and their works will be heard at the second, the fourth, and the
seventh recitals respectively. There is every justification for this
arrangement. With characteristic modesty, Rubinstein has not
devoted any entire programme to the discussion of his own pieces,
though the publio would certainly not have complained had he done
so. His particular Muse will, however, find expression at the seventh
(mystic number!) recital, in company with Nicolaus Rubinstein of
that ilk, and Buch small contemporary deer as Liadoff, Balakireff,
Rinsky-Korsakoff, and Ceasab-cui. My gracious! What names!
Familiar, too, don't they seem? In the same category the patronymic
of Tschaikowski rings refreshingly as that of an old friend. But a
truce to badinage. Rubinstein as composer of orchestral and piano-
forte works enjoys an European fame to the full as great as that
achieved by his playing. And, since he is a scientific and inspired
musician into the bargain, a very powerful combination of genius is
represented in an individual—so powerful indeed as to be unpre-
cedented, unless in the case of Schumann. All hail, thou Moldavo-
Russian, a cup of wine to thy health! And maystthou reap a golden
harvest with thy Cyccle I Nibbelunglet.
ON EPSOM EVE.
Trust Seers unto your sorrow,
What's dubious to divine.
The Sun will rise to-morrow;
That's safe—but will he shine?
None but a young beginner
Can oredit, or suppose,
A man e'er names the Winner,
Unless the Prophet knows.
You can but wait and wonder.
Predictions are in vain.
Look out for squalls, for thunder
And lightning, hail and rain.
The Derby was, one season,
Amid a snow-storm run;

Once more t>e lost and won.
FOLK-LORE AT FOLKESTONE.
When, Sir, you said, "Be off, and do it," I rushed away, and,
special trains being of no account (thanks to the courtesy of the
ever amiable Mr. Myles Fenton) soon found myself at the Folke-
stone Exhibition. To my delight 1 discovered it was the "Press
view day," and consequently had the advantage of the lecture of
a cicerone, denied to the general public. As I am a little deaf,
and there was a good deal of talking, which partially drowned the
speaker's voice, I am not quite sure I caught all he said, nor am I
certain that what I did catch I caught accurately; but these are the
statements I fancy he made :—
The Folkestone was the finest Art Exhibition in the world.
Florence was not in it, and South Kensington was simply nowhere
when compared with Folkestone.
All the curious armour decorating the transept came from the
Tower of London; and if a report had got about that the collection
had been supplied from the armoury once attached to Astley's
amphitheatre, the rumour was a canard. The armour was quite
genuine, and very historical.
The lecturer, a most pleasant gentleman (I heard him called a
Vine of several Summers, who would and could and should flourish
everywhere), who informed me that he was my "Hon. Executive
Adviser," seemed extremely proud of this martial display.
"You see," he said, "this is all genuine. That armour has been
worn by the British Army from the time of the Roses up to the
present. And as for those tattered flags, they have heen carried to
victory on many a hard fought field by the British Army and the
Militia!"
I noticed that the tattered flags were being hammered on to the
walls with a rigour that would be likely, when they got back to the
Tower, to add to their bullet-torn appearance. My "Hon. Execu-
tive Adviser" gave me further tips.
There were a lot of pictures—modern and ancient. The modern
pictures were finer than anything that had ever been seen before; and
the ancient—well, they were " Old Masters."
As I walked through the first Fine Art gallery, I was muoh struck
with some of the exhibits. There was an admirable portrait of either
Wilson Babbett or Henby Irving (as there was no catalogue I was
forced to make a guess as to which it was intended to represent) in
the character of Hamlet. Another "advertisement picture" was
what I took to be the original of that charming conception of the
hoardings, the young lady who washed herself ashore with a piece
of soap. Yet a third of the same class—a magnificent study of a
gorgeous blue silk dressing-gown, which I fancy could not have been
run together for less than two pounds, and which, considering the
material and the trimming, would have been extremely cheap at that
price! The artist, to give additional interest to what, I suppose, he
intended for a sign-board, had introduced a likeness of Sir Moses
Montefiore, as an appropriate accessory.
Hurrying through the Galleries, we came to the department de-
voted to curiosities. Here I found my "Hon. Executive Adviser"
once more overflowing with information." I regret to say that I could
not quite catch all he said, but I fancy he told me this:—
One of the cases contained the waistcoat in which James the
First was beheaded by Oliver Cromwell. Another, the latch-key
that Maby, Queen of Scots, gave to Chables the Second to admit
him to Kensington Palace, at that time a part of the Cinque Ports.
A third, the pocket-bible that Edwabd the Fiest carried with
him to the battles of the Roses. This came (I think) from Dover Castle.
A fourth, some enamels and snuff-boxes belonging originally to
the Princes murdered in the Tower. Some of these were very quaint,
and proved the infant collectors to be children of no ordinary intelli-
gence.
A fifth, the tattered flag of the Cinque Ports, borne before the
Warden five hundred years ago, and, consequently, at least of that
age, if not older. The exact birthday was not recorded.
Then there were hanging-up irons in which pirates used to be
executed, and gags for a scold, and tapestry, and pillories, and, in
fact, every luxury that could be imagined to render a mediaeval home
really happy.
Fol lowing the "Hon. Executive Adviser," I revelled in some
exciting French pictures and an admirable display of the aforesaid
"Old Masters," which were all the customary complimentary
adjectives, and a few over. Without doubt the Exhibition will be a
great success, and reflects credit upon all who took part in its creation.
The day concluded with a magnificent display of modernhospitality
under the superintendence of Messrs. Spiers and Pond. The "gem
of the curiosities" was the speech of the Mayor of Folkestone, in
gracefully returning thanks for "Prosperity to the Exhibition,"
proposed by a well-known journalist, dramatist, and musician. This
quaint oration was "so unique" that it can be neither imagined
nor described further than to say its characteristic was the element
of surprise. No more at present from

centrated essence of the Orestian Trilogy of jEscttylus prepared as a
soporific for society in Piccadilly. When the audience laughed
heartily at Agamemnon's latest humour, the Professor sprang up
from his seat, and glared at the audience, for though he was unarmed
with a cane or a birch-rod, he insisted on silence, and protested alike
against merriment and laughter. On one occasion the victims of
Orestes broke out into open mutiny. The cast, with one exception,
was too seriously weak for criticism. Ciytemnestra stormed, Aga-
memnon preached, the chorus and protagonists knocked up against
one another on the stage, the figures in the tableaux vivants by
Watts, R.A., Poynter, R.A., Walter Crane and Co., wobbled in
the lime-light, but when, to the delight of everybody, it was found
that pretty Miss Dorothy Dene put life and force into the captive
prophetess, Cassandra, when for the moment she became actually
inspired, easting aside the modern manner, and giving us tragedy as
it should be acted, and poetry as it should be spoken, the delighted
audience, released from an imprisonment of dulness, broke out like
schoolboys into the fresh air of applause. Miss Dorothy Dene
electrified them with her prophetic warning. But this was too much
for the Professor. Up he jumped, indifferent to the presence of the
Prince and Princess of Wales, and to the beaming countenance of
Sir Frederick Leighton, all of whom were vigorously applauding
the delightful Dorothy. His face glared in the gaslight. His
spectacles glistened like balls of fire. His classic forehead shone with
indignation, and then he gave vent to these words, "No! Applause!
I won't have it!" The startled audience for a moment sunk
abashed into silence. They thought they had been guilty of some
shocking solecism. Recovering a moment after, a shameless old
gentleman clapped his hands under his opera hat. The Professor
popped up like a Jack-in-the-Box. "I tell you no ! you mustn't."
A young lady tapped her fan against the opposite seat. "This is
shameful!" shouted the Professor. A graceless youth knocked his
stick against the floor. The Professor leaped to his feet. "How
dare you do it! No applause!" Whereat their Royal Highnesses
roared with laughter, the schoolmaster conquered, the Orestian Tri-
logy dragged its slow length along, for poor Cassandra was found
dead on the floor at the foot of Agamemnon's couch, and hidden by
the footlights.

A VOCATION.
Undergraduate (freshfrom tfie Schools). "By Jove !—a White Tie suits me so
WELL, I THINK I SHALL GO INTO THE CHURCH!"
A REAL STARTLER!
The Henley Meeting will provide a novelty for spectators this year if there is
any truth in the announcement recently made in the Evening Standard, under
the heading of " Sporting Items." It said:—
"The stewards of the Henley Meeting have decided to ignore the petition of the towns-
people respecting the alteration of the course. The Regatta, therefore, will start from the
bottom of the river at Regatta Island."
Those who have seen the Cirque Nautique in Paris will remember how the
Naiads first appear coming up from under the water. But for an entire Regatta
to start "from the bottom of the river" and come up to the top will be the greatest
attraction that Henley has ever offered. We hope the compiler of the Evening
Standard's Sporting Items has many such treats in store for the public.
A Revival.—So "Authors' Nights"—under the light and airy name of
"Matinees," which is only old-fashioned " Benefit" writ large—may come into
vogue again, that is, if the example of the authors of Jack Sheppard burlesque,
who initiated this old return, not " new departure." last Friday, is one which
other dramatic authors will care to follow. But why not? Why shouldn't the
authors have a benefit as well as the actors? It sounds too much like " going
round with the hat" to be quite agreeable to the feelings of the Highly Respectable.
But, sometimes, pride must be put into the pocket first if money is to follow.
The "Authors' Nights" meant <>retty well all the remuneration an author
received when he was only paid out of the "overplus," which did not usually
amount to very much: but, later on, three Authors' Nights put £400 in Gold-
smith's pocket for The Good Natured Man, and if this could be the rule now-
adays, such nights might be revived with considerable advantage to the authors,
if they do not oonsider the means undignified. There are good names for the
practice, and good ones against it. Dryden refused to avail himself of Authors'
Nights, but Goldsmith was only too glad of the chance. There are some hard
cases in which the authors deserve a benefit to make up for what they are com-
pelled to lose by a purely managerial arrangement which cute short the run of a
successful piece. The manager suffers too: but by his own fault.
THE WEARING OF THE ORANGE.
Specially arranged for those who are asking " Whether
Ulster will fight t"

In your thousands,"—observe ye the brag—
For it's big that ye '11 talk, ay, and bluster,
If you mean to De serving the flag.
Ye must pile up your story with slaughter,
Tell the deeds that you We done in your might,
Sing your song to the tune of " Boyne Water,"
And just vow you 're a divil to fight.
Ay, blow your own trumpet, my boys; that's the way
To show them you're wearing the Grange to-day.
And ye '11 shout, my boys, louder and louder,
Till they think that ye 11 give it them hot.
Though it may be ye've run out of powder,
And never meant firing a shot.
But no matter; keep up agitation,
While ye boast you 're defending the Crown,
And, though only a fifth of the nation,
Swear you '11 hold all the rest of it down.
Ay, plenty of bounce, boys,—and sure that's the way
To prove that you 're wearing the Orange to-day.
But if Parliament press on the measure
Till it comes to be law of the land,
Say. my boys, will it suit your good pleasure,
That the dastardly outrage shall stand!
Well, bedad, though you 're ripe for all treason,
And will threaten your country and Queen,
I suppose that ye '11 listen to reason
And be wise—as ye always have been!
Perhaps, on the whole, 'tis the pleasantest way.
To show how you 're wearing the Orange to-day.

THE FINISH!!
The race is at its hottest, and the cry is, " Here they come!"
They are fathered in a cluster as they round the turn for home.
The pace has been a cracker, it was set them by the Crack,
"With the"oldest, yet the daringest, of jockeys on his back.
He has won a lot of races by that same prodigious dash,
But this time he's overdone it, and must come to utter smash,
Say the cutest race-courso oracles. The Favourite this year
Is a horse of stretch tremendous, but its pedigree is queer;
By Sedition, out of Shamrock, say the knowing ones, though some
Hold the sire was rare old Statesman, which the others deem a hum.
He has come into the betting in a very sudden way,
He was last year thought a cripple, who could neither spurt nor stay.
He has never won a race yet, having commonly been scratched,
Whether for market reasons or from being overmatched;
But his trainer has done wonders with a most unlikely horse,
And thinks his chance is rosy, over this especial course.
And the stable is so popular, the jockey is so skilful,
That, although the strain seems doubtful, and the horse's temper's
wilful.
Yet the nag has lots of backers, though the knowing ones fight shy.
The crowd has put the pot on and seem game once more to try
Luok with their favourite jockey, whatsoever be his mount.
Well, his chances at the moment do not look of much account.
He has made the running fiercely; he has boldly forced the pace;
Will he keep the lead much longer? "Will he even get a place P
He has "come back to his horses" in a most decided style.
And the faoe of the old jockey does not wear its usual smile.
His cool, wiry, younger rival, whom the shouters hail as "Joe."
The hope of the same stable but a few short months ago,
Is bent upon a cut at his old chum; he may be seen
In red white and blue on Unity: he's close upon the green,
He seems to overhaul him, as he comes hand over hand,
With no mercy for the Old one, and no reverence for the Grand.
Oh, Whig is very handy, and Coercion makes a show,
But what the Favourite chiefly fears is Unity and Joe.
Will's a wondrous artful jockey, and he's best at pinch and push,
But can he land this race, though, with his favourite final rush?
See, see,' he lifts his whip-hand, he is riding, riding hard,
Yet the Favourite's nose is scarce in front, there isn't half a yard
Between him and the second. Half a yard? There's not a foot,
And the Favourite looks pounded, and his jockey fagged, to boot.
Their followers look frightened, they 're in doubt about their " tin."
He will make a plucky race for it; hut can he, can he win P
ATHENIANS AT HENGLER'S.
"And very notably discharged."—Midsummer Night's Dream.
I hope the British School of Archaeology at Athens has profited
considerably more than I have by the performance of Mr. Tod-
hunter's Helena in Troas,
at Hengler's Circus. Con-
sidering the difficulties with
which Mr. Godwin, F.8.A.,
had to contend, he has to be
congratulated on his success
in reproducing the most
perfect imitation of a Greek
Theatre ever seen in London.
The first thing was to
make it as unlike a "Ring"
—redolent of sawdust, and
associated with jocose me-
mories of Mr. Merriman
and the Ring-master — as
possible; and this end was
partially achieved by burn-
ing a considerable amount
of .incense, suggestive of the
Circus having been "con-
verted" into a place of
worship, Roman or Greek,
or even Irvingite, so that to
those who came to scoff it
was thus intimated that
"Paris and back,"-C8peciaU> the back. the7 ™Te expected to re-
main to pray, or at least
to listen with such reverent attention as would be utterly incom-
patible with the jests of the Shakspearian Clown, or the antics of
"Little Sandy."
In the centre of the Circus has been erected an altar to Aiowiroj—
("the only os in the ring," remarked the irrepressible Mr. "WAO-
staff, who had already taken occasion to whisper that " we oughtn't

to be incensed before the performance began," and that " the Circus
has been materially altered")—and viewing the Ring from the stalls,
its aspect reminds me of a huge swimming-bath after the water had
been "run off," apparently through a large square hole, underneath
the stage, looking uncommonly like the aperture of an enormous
drain-pipe. As this thought ocours to me, the curtains rise,—a con-
cession to modernism, sorely vexing to the classical souls of Professors
Godwin and Todhunteb,—and, at the same moment, from a small
door on the left of the stage, appear a number of young Ladies in
elegant classic bathing-dresses, who have either come to stretch their
limbs and promote circulation by walking round the now dry bath
after bathing, or previous to bathing are going to wait till the water is
turned on. At all events, formed two and two, like the young Ladies
of Miss Tickletoby's Academy coming from church, they go round the
Circus with a graceful movement of the arms and heads, pantomi-
mically expressive of the process of eating tantalisingly flaccid aspara-
gus; and then, as they walk round, they appear so utterly bored with
it all, so weary of everything and everybody, that it is evident they
would be glad to leave off slithering about on the tesselated pavement
in order to flop down anywhere for rest,—which, by the way, they all
ultimately do, the ones with some vitality still left in them having their
faces towards the stage, while the hopelessly exhausted maidens re-
cline, limp, but classio to the last, with their backs to the performers.
A month's training at the Savoy from Sir Arthur and Sir Author
would be of distinct advantage to Messrs. Todhunter and Godwin's
band and chorus—that is, to judge from this first representation.
The Greek young Ladies have to keep their eyes on a stately head-
pupil, or perhaps governess, whose actions they closely imitate.
This lady's Grecian profile is not, I notice, unlike Mary Anderson's
as Galatea, but here the resemblance ceases, at least, without a con-
siderable development of the idea, as, after gazing upon her for some
minutes—it required all that to take her in completely,—I could not
help exclaiming, in the words of the immortal Kojoj koI Bofoi, by
Maddisonos Mortonos, "There is no mistaking that majestic
personage, it is Penelope Anne!"
Henceforward, Chief Teacher, Governess, or Head-Pupil of the
Grecian .Young Ladies' Academy, to me she was only, and could only
he "Penelope Anne." The young Ladies now practise a series of
graceful extension motions as their contribution to the scenes in the
Circle, and, after a melancholy chant, in which, I believe, they are
expressing opinions anything but complimentary to the play, the
actors, and Messrs. Todhunteros and Godwtnos, there enters a
young classical Lady on the stage, whose faoe the light will not per-
mit me to see clearly, but who, i am informed, is Miss Alma Murray
(had it been Alma Mater, or Alma Tadema, it would have been
more in keeping with the classicality of the occasion,—but " Murray
come up!" as Mr. "Wagstaff wittily observed, "you can't have it
all your own way"), as Helena.
She, being on the stage, is addressed by Penelope Anne, who is
in the Circus, and this is just as startling as if some one in the pit or
stalls got up suddenly and addressed Henry Irving, and gave him a
bit of his mind, and didn't spare the rough side of his tongue. For
it seems to be Penelope Anne's peculiar and somewhat presump-
tuous mission to rise on every occasion and to abuse the principal
aotor or actress, lecturing them sharply, discussing with them indi-
vidually the motive and action of the pl&y> and I must admit getting
occasionally severely and deservedly snubbed in return for such un-
called-for and impertinent interference.
Yet it would not be an unwholesome innovation were 'a semicircle
in front of the stage to be cleared out on every first night, into which
a band of critics, two and two, should maroh, in classic attire, headed
by Mr. Moy Thomas, Mr. Joseph Knight, or Mr. Clement Scott,
who should stop the action of the play to inquire why Henry Irving
or Miss Terry did so-and-so, why he said this or that, why they
Soke in such tones, and who should offer their opinions collectively,
tor consultation with their doyen, as to what ought to be cut, what
retained, and to recommend alterations and reconstruction, or what-
ever they might consider necessary for ultimate success of a new piece.
Fancy the first night of a melodrama, or a Pantomime, at Drury Lane,
with Augustus Druriolanus on the stage to explain, apologise, and,
if possible, snub the chorus of critics as they flopped down on the
floor ofithe house, a spectacle for gods and men. _ The revival of the
Chorus in this form might have its use. And indeed, I think that
this is the moral of the classio experiment at Hengler's. I can
deduce no other of any practical value.
Mr. Beerbohm-Tree was an Ideal Paris—to those who had
figured Paris to themselves as Mr. Beerbohm-Tree. The same
may be said of Helena, CEnone (with a sensation "footer" off the
ramparts) and the rest (of the pnnoipals, including Mr. Yezln, who
gave one fine speech about " King Zeus" finely. But, on the whole,
the performance by these learned Athenians—always excepting
Penelope Anne and the Greek Girls' 8chool—struck me as bearing a
remarkable resemblance to the celebrated classio Idrama called
Py ramus and Thisbe, as played before their Royal Highnesses
Theseus and Hippolyta at Athens, on a most memorable occasion.

FAIR PLAY.
TnE Folkestone Exhibition is to be open on
Sundays, which is a move in the right direc-
tion, as is also the opening of the Crystal
Palace for Sunday dinners. In Oceana, Mr.
Froude asks plaintively why we are not per-
mitted harmless enjoyment on Sundays, and
on board ship he found the observance of this
Puritanical tradition most irksome. And yet
the appearance of the river on Sundays in
Summer and of the Riverside Hostelries would
not convey to the intelligent foreigner the
idea of the English being averse to enjoying
themselves on the first day of the week.
It is only a very Illiberal party that would
have legislative coercion either for or against
making holiday on Sunday. But give the
work-a-day folk the chance, and let the
arrangements be so contrived that all shall
get their fair share of rest from labour once
in the week, turn and turn about. Difficult,
we are aware, but not impossible. All work

A FULL HOUSE-AFTER DINNER.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commont, Monday Night, May 17.—Depression of trade
in the carrying business partially arrested by development of politics
in the House of Commons. Quite a common thing now to see heavy
waggon crossing Palace Yard. Contents, a great cylinder of paper.
This is a Petition for or against the Irish Government Bills. Threat-
ened strike amongst Messengers. Didn't mind gymnastic exercises
with Mr. Bradlaugh, or expulsion of Irish Members, But this
lugging of paper-rolls up and down stairs, and into House, provokes
spirit of mutiny.
But what becomes of Petition after it has been presented? What
effect does it have upon .the Debate, much less on the Division?
Nevertheless, Macdonald a proud man as he looked upon the paper-
clad cylinder, and watched the two Messengers artistically staggering
in their efforts to carry it away.
New debate on Second Reading Home-Rule Bill. Grand Cross
begins pecking at Members opposite as a sparrow on the roadside
pecks at stray grains of seed. Stansfeld made good speech, and
Bhyce a better. Members on all sides cheered madly when Bryce
alluded to near contingency of Dissolution. Stranger in Gallery
would suppose nothing an M.P. likes so much as General Election.
Been seated less than six months. Now all he wants is another appeal
to his constituents. Shouts with fierce delijjht at mere mention of
thing. Still, when excitement of the cheering over, unmistakable
air of sadness enveloped House. "Ah, few shall meet where many
part!" says Lyon Playfair, looking round on the crowded
benches.
Just before midnight sad news goes round. Sir Tiiomas Erskine
May has just died. Lord Fahnborough he was newly named, but
had not taken his seat. Here we have not ceased to miss his familiar
presence in the Chair, and now he has been called to " another place"
not named in his patent of Peerage. A good, capable, courteous,
kindly man, his memory will be kept green among the recollections
of the older Parliaments.
Business done.—Adjourned Debate on Government of Ireland Bill.
Tuesday.—Still harping on the Home-Rule Bill. Before debate
renewed. Hicks Beach wanted to know when the debate would con-
clude. Thought it might very well come to an end on Friday.
Gladstone suitably impressed with this anxiety on part of Leader
of Opposition to expedite business. Unusual, but not less satis-
factory. Still, not able to avail himself of extraordinary phenomena.
Concerned largely for the Liberal dissentients. They naturally and
justifiably anxious to explain to the House, "and," the Premier
added, "to the Constituencies," grounds of their dissent. Here
Members tittered. Otherwise conversation oarried out with pro-
foundest gravity, greatly impressing strangers in the Gallery.
Charles Lewis wanted to say a few words on proposition to
renew Arms Act, but Parnellites, as usual, concerned upon point
of order. Till Healy repeatedly rose to order. Parnell turned up
twice. Mitchell Henry, rising from opposite benches, received
with shouts of pained surprise by Parnellites. Not unnaturally
forgot something he had to say. Proposed, a little later, to con-
tinue remarks. This was more than mildest Parnellites could stand.
"Spoken! Spoken!" they roared. After facing storm for two
minutes by the clock, Mitchell Henry sat down.
"Ha! ha!" said Joseph Glllis, rubbing his hands. "This is
better. I'm getting blue mouldy for want of little excitement."

Joseph's eyes glistened again, when, as the Debate proceeded,
Shaw Lefevre brought up Chamberlain. Chamberlain bland in
manner, but evidently blazing in bosom. Chaplin in great form.
Blooming with perorations like a rose garden in June. Disraeli
hash," said Randolph, as Chaplin denounced "this ill-omened and
pernicious measure, conceived in darkness and concealment, hatched
in secresy, and brought forth in shame."
Speech of evening delivered by Sage of Queen Anne's Gate; full of
point and pith, and the homely wisdom known as common sense. The
Sage has a curious manner of investing his speech with conversational
charm by pointedly addressing some particular Member other than
the Speaker. To-night, with hands on hip, oscillating between the
edge of the matting and the floor, performing incessantly a kind of
double shuffle, he button-holed the Pbemieb, chatting with him in
friendliest manner, discussing Chamberlain, Habtington, Ran-
dolph, Chaplin, and others, as if they were alone in the smoking-
room. Pbemier enjoyed conversation immensely, roaring with


laughter at the quips and cranks. House laughed too, all save
Chaplin, who sat unmoved, with stern regard marvelling that House
of Commons should delight in fooling of this kind whilst yet the
Chamber held the echoes of the sonorous periods culminating in the
reference to "the noblest monument of national and human great-
ness the world had ever seen in the Sovereign Parliament and in the
Sovereign Empire of the Queen."
Wednesday,—"Ireland again!" said Robeetson. "Thought
other parts of a kingdom still united might have a chance to-day.
Turned out otherwise. Parnellites got first
place with Poor Law Guardians' Bill, which re-
ceived support of Chief Secretary, and was carried
by nearly two to one. In course of speech, John
Mobxet made matter-of-fact reference to what
might happen when the present Government
brought in their Local Government Bill, at
which :evidence of confidence in the future,
Hon. Gentlemen opposite squirmed.
Business done.—Several Bills advanced a stage.
Thursday. — Randolph had rather a bad
quarter of an hour this evening. Question before
House, Second Heading of Arms Bill. Some
time ago in speech at Belfast, excited by the
warlike presence of Orangemen, Randolph had
intimated his opinion that if the Home-Rule
Bill were passed the Ulster men would jbe
. justified in armed resistance. Necessary, on
reflection, to explain this away. As Har-
coubt says, "Tne policy of Mr. Smith has
now become a policy of explanation. One
day the Markis explains his twenty vears
of coeroion, the next Randolph explains
his incitement to civil war."
Latter rather a comical performance. Dragged in Lord Althorpe
and John Morley, quoting passages which had not the remotest
bearing on particular case, and applied them in justification. House
roared with laughter. Only Randolph apparently grave. Glad-
stone not in his place when Randolph spoke. Came in later, and,
hearing what had passed, fell upon Randolph. "A late Secretary of

Mobley, had gone away to dinner, and missed the lecture.

She has," he said, "four 43-ton guns, and she has already fired
them at sea without any serious result occurring;" and the Secretary
to the Admiralty resumed his seat with a consciousness that if any
man wanted more than that, he was unworthy of consideration.

[June 5, 1886.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
London has never been so musical as
it is at present. While the number of
Concerts, of every size and shape, that
are daily and almost hourly given is
something quite extraordinary, on every
side there are indications of improving
taste among audiences. As a conse-
quence, there is a marked improvement
in the quality of the entertainments pro-
vided, and merely to mention all the
good music,—to say nothing of the bad,
—that has been performed within a given
week would beaformidable undertaking.
One bright sign of the times is that we
are beginning to take more interest in
orchestral music. There is an appre-
ciative public for any first-class instru-
mental concert by whomsoever inau-
gurated, without prejudice to time-
honoured institutions such as the
Philharmonic, Richter, or Crystal Palace
Concerts. Thus encouraged, Mr. Cab-
bodps, the violinist, no longer gives a
violin "recital," with piano accompani-
ment. No: he boldly takes the St.
James's Hall, engages a fine band, and
treats his friends to some Concertos.
Similarly, Mr. Cusins,—not Cusins Ger-
man, but decidedly English,—having
secured the services of Madame Patti,
does not rely solely upon the diva, but
announces four orchestral concerts, at
the Albert Hall. The first is fixed for
the afternoon of June 5, with Path to
sing, Papini to play the violin, and
Cirsnfstoconducttheband. What Oliver
Twist could ask for more ?—unless it
were a well-selected programme.
Signor Laqo, at Covent Garden, has
been obliged to "do without" either
Patti or Nilsson in his Italian Opera
Season. But he has done very well up to
now with Madame de Cepeda and Mile.
Ella Russell. The former was capi-
tal in Lucrezia Borgia, exhibiting, in
COMPARING NOTES.

of marching with the
addition to a well-trained voice, some
fine] dramatic touches in her acting.
The new Contralto, Mile. Lubatovi, is
not quite up to the mark. Madame
Scalchi's reappearance iseagerly looked
forward to. Gayarre's voice, full of
fire and animation, is marred by the
vicious.'n'iraio, and at times resembles
the vox humana stop of an organ coupled
to the tremolo. This won t do, Gay
'Any. But he is a great improvement
on Signor Martni, who took his place in
Rigoletto last week. Signor Mabjhi
sings out of tune, not to put too fine a
point on it. The chorus is particularly
to be commended, though it has not
been hitherto severely taxed; and Signor
Bevignani is in himself a guarantee of
general artistio interpretation.
► Carl Rosa opened fire with English
Opera, at popular prices, at Drury
Lane on Monday. Mesdames Gaylord,
Georglna Burns, and Marion Burton,
Mr. Charles Lyall, and Mr. Barring-
ton Foote are none of them strangers
to opera-goers. A blank is of course
felt in the ranks owing to the loss of
Mr. Maas; but with a constantly
changing bill, and the production of at
least one novelty—William of Cabe-
stan, by Mackenzie—the short season
of four weeks will be highly interesting.
The last-named Composer's Colomba is,
we are told, to be heard in Italian at
Covent Garden. The Opera has never
been really successful in English, nor
is it to be compared, for grace and
charm, to Goring Thomas's Esme-
ralda, which seems to have been over-
looked.
One of the best Amateur Concerts
ever heard was held at Prince's Hall on
May 28. Mr. Lionel Benson conducted
his Band and Choir of "Magpies" to
triumph. He, too, sees the advisability

times, and accordingly
he supplemented a pro-
gramme of part-songs
and solos with a string
Orchestra, led by Mr.
Louis D'Egville. Mrs.
Bowyer-Lane sang in
a deliciously pure voice
the well-known "In
der Fremde" (which,
having too many verses,
involves the too fre-
quent repetition of an
otherwise pleasing me-
lody), and a little gem
bv Brahms, "Verge-
Miches Stdndchen." The
last was one of the
Srettiest and best-ren-
ered items of the
The Double-Headed Carl-Augustus-Rosa-Harris Nightingale in the evening. Mr. L. Ben-
Lane, and Signor Lago-Al-Factotum-del-la-citta in the Garden. SON, who pronounces
French in a refreshingly
perfect manner, and who articulated his words with the same excellence that characterised his phrasing of the music, gave Gounod's
Serenade, " Quand tu chantes," with violin obligate. It is said that there is to be a special arrangement of this song for a Mag-pie-anner
accompaniment; it is to be adapted as the Railwayman's Song, and to commence, "When you Shunt."
A great feature was the "Plantation Song and Chorus," composed by Mr. A. Scott Gatty (who also sang the solo part), with band
accompaniment, entitled " Dinah's Wedding." This was loudly applauded, as it deserved to be, being, on the whole, an ingenious and
amusing musical joke. It seems almost impossible to get Amateurs to play stringed instruments in tune. But perhaps at their next Concert
the "Magpies" will be in a position to match the good intention and expression which they already have, with a more correct intonation.
Among other part-songs Bishop's " 0! by Hirers " was most delightfully rendered under the baton of Mr. Benson; and Mrs. Stanley
Stubbs, in a becoming Magpie" costume of black and white, sang, "Sing on, ye Little Birds" to glorious and absolute perfection.
People are apt to go to the theatre and think solely of the "piece," and, in comio opera or burlesque, of the "songs" and
"singing." They are prone to underrate the value of the band and band-master, who are so instrumental in giving point to
the situations of a drama, and their fullest and best effect to the numbers of a musical work. "The Music" is too often regarded
as representing a necessary expense which is nevertheless grudgingly incurred: when the treasury is low it is a common thing to
commence economy in the band, and if not to "kill a fiddler," at least to discharge one. The conductor should have full scope for
his invention, plenty of players, and plenty of room for them—as he has at Drury Lane, even when a drama is being played. He is not

Harrised by the lessee; and accordingly you get fine sonorous
entr'actes and refined explanatory strains delivered by sympathetic
combinations of instruments. The notion of introducing the
"villain" with a roll upon the side-drum, and a general tohu-bohu
in the orohestra is out of date, and so ought the pruning system
alluded to above to be. Mr. Barrett does well to bar it; he will
not revert to it in a "hurry." Discrimination should be used, and
graduated intensity aimed at. Give your mere sneaking poltroon a
wheeze upon the clarionet accompanied by "muted" strings. More
urgent cases demand stronger and perhaps quicker measures. For
a regular up-and-down scoundrel you have the "reserved force" of
all the performers—you issue, as it were, a four-line whip and lash
the audience into exoitement.
Very good, in this respect, is the band at the Princess's, directed by
Mr. Edward Jones. But his musical box is too small. The musicians
are packed like sardines—or, as they might say, sordines—and the con-
ductor is obliged to beat time between the cross-fire of the first and
second violins' cross-bows. This makes him sad. No wonder his eyes
have a " far-off" look. They would doubtless fain be farther off still.
But he does not promise on the programme more than he can perform
with admirable precision and effect. In Clito, the procession and
chorus, at the beginning of the Fourth Act, is full of local colour, and
among the original incidental music, a species of delightful " Idyll,"
played just before the rising of the curtain upon the last Aot, is so
clever as to be worthy far more attention than it is likely to receive
under present circumstances, and in competition with the refresh-
ment bars.
Of light operatic bands, that now presided over by M. Augusts
Van Biene, at the Comedy, is a most favourable specimen. Apart
from any consideration of The Lily of Leoville as a composition
(though en passant I have a good opinion of it), the manner in which
the score is interpreted by the instrumentalists is in itself refreshing.
A. Van Bienb conducts I. Van Caryll's music. Entering the
orchestra he raises his stick, nods to his " leader," looks at the bassoon
(I'd almost fagott' it), as much as to say, "Are you reedy f" and
away they go with the overture. The gentleman entrusted with the
drum does not forget to beat it, and he does his work in a manner
that's neither eccentric nor trifling. To me the drummer has been
an object of affection for years; and to that important member of
the orchestra—who, it may be, has often only a few nuts with which
to beguile the tedium of two or three hundred bars of enforced
"rest"—this tardy tribute is offered in all humility by
Nibbexunolit.

A NEW NATHANAL MOVEMENT.
Messrs. L. and H. Nathan have taken the Novelty Theatre with
the view of letting it principally for Amateur Performances. This
enterprising firm, presumably, the well-known Theatrical Costumiers,
should change the title of the Theatre, and call it " The Nathanal
Amateur Theatre,"—a style which would not exclude performers of
any Nathan-ality. If the Nathanal Amateurth are anything like as
good as Lady Monckton has shown herself to be, then the Regular
Professionals will have to wake up a bit. Of course the performance
will be always for some Charity—which no longer begins at Home, but
generally at Theatres—and after expenses, the residuum will be
applied to the benefit of such Charity. We know of one set of Amateurs,
in the country, who played for a most deserving object, and paid all
the expenses of the entertainment, including hire of theatre, dresses,
&c, out of their own pockets, so that they were enabled to hand oyer
the entire proceeds, without any deduction whatever, to the Charity
in question. Let the Nathanal Amateurth at the New Nathanal
Theayter do thith, and it will be thomething like a Novelty.
A Correspondent signing himself "A True Patriot," sends us
the following outting from a newspaper:—
GOOD GENERAL, age 21, SEEKS SITUATION in Stoke Newing-
ton or immediate neighbourhood. Good character. Wages £16, and
all found. Apply, &c.
And he wishes to know shall such a hero as this be lost to Ulster?
"Wages £16, and all found." Ha 1 ha! They don't want to fight,
Sorr, but, by jabers, if they do,—they 've got the money (what's a
dirty £16?) and they've got the men ("all found") and they've
got the General, if they want him, at Stoke Newington. It will be
much cheaper than getting Our Only General to lead them to glory.

LONDON IN JUNE.
An Intercepted Letter.
'Tis June, and the Season's beginning,
We went to the Derby, of course,
And Eveleen sneered at my winning
Because she was " on" the wrong horse.
With Ascot and Goodwood to follow,
I vow there's no reason to fret,
While Charlie says I need not holloa
Before lam" out of the net."
I scarce know his meaning; no matter;
He's nice, and a heavy dragoon,
And loves irrepressible chatter.
And London, the Season, and June.
We were, as you know, both presented,
Our names you would see in the Post,
Though Eveleen seems quite contented,
My dress was admired far the most.
How trying the Drawing-Room crush is,
But when it is over and done,
You think not of envious rushes,
And only remember the fun;
The Princess has never looked sweeter
Than on that superb afternoon;
Oh, who can describe them in metre,
Our London, the Season, and June!
We've been to the Opera duly,
The real Italian thing,
Gayarre delightful is truly,
The Company knows how to sing.
The Drama too claims our attention
Some three times a week, as a rule;
It surely is needless to mention
We dote upon Irving and Toole.
And haply a ball follows after:
On balcony, lit by the moon,
One flirts, with low whispers and laughter,
In London, the Season, and June.
And then there's the new Exhibition;
The Quadrant the place is, to dine,
The room's in a charming position,
And good the cuisine and the wine.
You look out on gardens and fountains,
Hear Godfrey s most musical band;
The water shoots up like gold mountains,
Dissolving in silvery sand.
And then Charlie says it is pleasant,
I think that he calls it, to spoon ;"
But no more from me, for the present,
On London, the Season, and June.
"The Colinderies"—not simply "Colo-
nies," or what becomes of India in the Colonial
and Indian Exhibition?—have aroused the
theatrical world. All the theatres are in full
swing—(an unpleasant expression, but highly
suggestive of 1 air-time, and plenty of Shows
going on)—there are two Operas going simul-
taneously, and M. Mayer opens Her Majesty^
Theatre—to be temporarily known as "His
Mayerjesty's "—for French plays. Madame
Jane Hading is to play Denise, a play not
depending for its success upon one character,
but on the ensemble. "Our pretty Jane" was
not the original Denise, but the part ought to
suit her. We hope there's a good east for it.
When Helena in Troas has left Hengler's, the
proprietors should take a hint from the Cirque
Nautique in the Rue St. Honore, where the
floor of the Equestrian Ring sinks, and, the
space it occupied being immediately filled with
water, becomes a swimming-bath. Naiads rise
from their grottoes below, where the electric
light is shining—a very grotto-esque effect—
and disport themselves Beckwithiauly. It is a
real novelty, and ought to prove an attraction
to any Circus entertainment which is not
already getting on swimmingly.
THE DOG IN THE DISMAL DUMPS.
{After Lonyfclloxc.)

He saw the flash of the bull's-eye lamp,
And heard the stern Policeman s tramp

And Cockneys have their fling,
He had followed at his master's side,
Not choked by any gag, nor tied
By any piece or string.
Alas! He wandered off to chase
Imaginary game,
And in that labyrinthine place
Could not his canine steps retrace
Ere murky t wilight came.
He'd heard Sir Charles was an austere
And very muzzling man;—
How dogs regarded him with fear,
And boys took care he was not near
When equirting-time began.
So, crouched and trembling, there he lay,
While all things else were free;
The odds were, if he slank away,
He'd end, if not his days, the day
At lethal Battersea!
The Field Against the Favourite.—On
the Derby Day, Mr. Justice Field, in the
Queen's Bench Division, finding very few
special jurors in attendance, had the panel
called over, and imposed a fine of £20 on all
those who failed to answer to their names.
These jurors had much better have left the
Favourite alone and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CITY WAITERS' FESTIVAL.

I have, on more occashuns than I cares to menshun, wentured to
describe, for the hinformashun of a curius Publick, many of the werry
grandest, and staggeringest, and artistickest Bankwets or Festiwells
of moddern times; but there is one as is about to be held on Friday
nex, at the Cannon Street Hotel, that, in my werry umbel opinion, out-
shines 'em all, not for its splender, for that ain't werry grate, not
for its grand queseen, tho' that will be wun as is not to be sneared at
ewen by a orty Warden, and not for the presence of Dooks or
Markisses, tho' there will be for Cheerman won of the elerqwentest
and risingest yung Members of the House of Commens itself, but for
its haim, and its hobjick, and its hend.
What is that haim, what is that hobjick, what is that hend?
That haim is hnmanatty, that hobjick is benelowence, that hend is
t'ustise. In other and simpler, but not truer words, it is for the
lelping of "The City Waiters' Provident and Pension Society."
What doesn't mankind owe to a honest, and attentif, and loyal
Waiter? Wot's a good Dinner without good waiting, and where's
the fine freedom for conwersashun without loyalty among the
Waiters? and the Echo ansers where? The Public, tho' ginerally a
ginerous Public, is allso sumtimes a thortless one. They sees us
allers drest in the full-blown dignerty of heavening dress, and
almost allers with that plessent smile so indickatif of an arty
welcora, and they naturally cums to the pleasin delushun that the life
of a Waiter must needs be a appy one, and his puss filled to the
brim, or he coud not posserbly pay his emense Tayler's bills.
Far be it from me to complane of my lot or of the lots of Waiters,
my respected Bretheren, but there is Bitch a thing as sickness, ewen
for a Waiter, tho, ginerally Bpeaking, the elthiest as well as the
atientest, and most contentedest of uman beings, and then what is
e to do, and there is sitch a thing as old age, ewen for a Waiter, and
then what is he to do?
In either of these unfortnit cases, in steps the City Waiters'
Society, and if he's ill they sends him their own xcellent Docter,
who knos by long xperience the wery speshall ills as Waiters' flesh is
air to, and allows him a nice little penshun till he gits quite well and
is able to resoom his usefool perfeshnal dooties. And if it's unfort-
netly a case of old age, as no docter carnt cure; no, not ewen Mr.
Adams hisself with all his kindly care and skill, in steps the Socierty,
and they says to the pore Weteran, cheer up old trend, we ain't
werry rich, but we've got enuff to promise you a nice little pension
as long as you lives, and they leaves him smilin and appy. But in
order to enabel the Socierty to do all this good, they must in corse
have money.
Well, I shood think from my long egsperience in this grand old
City of ours, what with the Copperashun and its six and twenty
Haldennen, and its two hundred Common Councilmen, and what
with the Livvery Cumpanys with their seven thowsand Liwerymen,
and what with all the grate City Bankers and Merchents as attends
the grate Charity Dinners and stumps up their money so freely and
so hansumly, and what with the numbers of West End Swells as
cums to that weritable home of horsepitality, the Manshun House,
that there wood be little or no differculty in raising a few hundred
?ounds a year for sitch a truly kind and benelowent purpuss. But
'm sorry to say as there is. I don't beleive myself as it's want of
will, but want of thort, as purwents our kyind paytrons from sub-
scribing. Our remarkable respectabel apearance injures our cause
among the thortless diners out, our hintimate nolledge of all the
dellycassies of a most waried Menu, and our purfecly wunderfool
acquaintance with ewery wintage and ewery Brand of reelly fine
Wines,—amost equall to that of the City Controller hisself,—deceives
the Public, and we gits more credit than we deserves for as much
wealth as nolledge.
Ah, if a fairish number of the Gents who will dine in this grate
City on ewery luxery of the season during the next month or two,
without having nothink to pay for it, wood just give a thort to the
trubbles as sumtimes falls to the lot of the pore Waiter who is atend-
ing to all his wants so patiently and so plessentlv, and make up his
mind to send a donashun or so to the careful Seckerterry, Mr. G.
Meads, at 28, Martin's Lane, Cannon Street, hee see, he'd make
sitch a good dinner, and go home so cheerfool and appy, as his hone
wife wood ardly know him. I lernt the lesson manv years ago, and
have never forgotten it, that appyness was born a Twin, and them
twins is Horsepitality and Benelowense. Robert.
BAT AND BALL.
Ball. Aha! Leather's power no longer you'll spurn,
My swaggering Willow. At last 'tis my turn.
Bat. Much good may it do both the Public and you.
The gate-money's little when runs are but few.
Ball. You sordid old slogger! for shame, Sir, for shame!
Do you mean to say Dowling's no part of the game?
Bat. Oh, yes. you are useful enough, in your way,
That is, for the batsmen to swipe at all day!
Ball. All day, why the best of 'em can't make a score.
Bat. No credit to you, 'tis the steady down-pour
That turns wickets into a slippery swamp,
And makes a man wish that nis bat was a Gamp,
That gives you the pull. But you really must know
That your sole friend, the rain, is the Cricketer's foe.
Ball. The batsman's, you mean.
Bat. And the Public's beside.
Ball. Oh there, I've no patience at all with your pride.
The Graces, and Murdochs, and Reads, more's the shame,
With their century-scores have spoilt you and the game.
The newspapers' praise and the company's shout
Make you think that the game's just to knock me about.
Thank goodness that Spofforth, and Lohmann, and Peate
Are making you suffer the pangs of defeat,
And righting the matter a little at last.
There's nothing like leather!
Bat. Oh, come, not so fast.
Much fun. Sir, the Public from Cricket would get
If the wickets were always as horriblv wet
As they have been of late. Rain may keep down the scoring,
But everyone votes it is beastly and boring.
Who'd stump up his shilling to sit in a shower,
Or under a gingham half-frozen to cower,
To see three good wickets go down in one over?
No, no, brother Ball, the most critical lover
Of Cricket likes sunshine, dry grass, and a Score!
Ball. I'm afraid you are right. When this deluge is o'er,
And some smiter, like Grace, comes along with his bat,
And a cabbage-leaf puggeree stuck in his hat,
And for five hours knocks me all'over the field
To the tune of two hundred, 'twill probably yield
More pleasure to most than to witness poor me
The ten wickets knock down for an average of three.
Though Spofforth, the demon, himself do tho trick.
'Tis a bit hard on me.
Bat. Well, the Public is quick
To do justice to both; and although it is true
I'm the favourite, where were the game without you?
One to Sir Charles.
Bravo, Sir Charles Warren! You score. People say
That your Muzzleman edict the dog-owners hurts;
But all—save the roughs—must be with you to-day,
And rejoice that you 're down on the Squirts.

or not, send for the doctor, who will decide the case on its
merits. Fending his arrival take courage, camphor, and
cognac. Make your will.
K \ in hquakes.—In case of an Earthquake, remove your-
self with the utmost rapidity beyond the calculated area of
disturbance to terra tinner, or go up in a balloon, if there
is one handy.
Explosions, Dynamite, N itro-G l ycerin e. &c.—In the
event of being blown up by any of the explosive agents
now in vogue among patriots, keep calm and collected; try
and follow the course taken by any of your limbs that may
be dissevered from the trunk, so as to be able to find and
claim them upon your return to your native land: but
inasmuch as prevention is better than cure, it is well to
avoid the neighbourhood of public buildings during the
dynamite season, or after the rejection of any Irish Bill by
the House of Lords or Commons; for, though we must all
die, it is better to die in peace, and, if possible, in one piece.
N.B.—The victim ot a nitro-glycerine explosion can
sometimes be partially re-collected, but can never be
properly re-membered.
Falls.—Falls are of many kinds and of different degrees
of violence and intensity. If a person falls on his head he
is to be pitied, if he falls on his feet he is to be envied. It
he falls down-stairs, send for the doctor • if he falls into
the water, send for the brandy bottle; if he falls from the
top of the Monument, Bend for the coroner.
! Fits.—Let every member of the household wear ready-
made clothes, they will never be troubled with fits.
Nose-Bleeding.—The violent impact of a foreign body
upon the proboscis often causes nose-bleeding. Take
lessons in the Art of Self-defence.
I have an infallible specific for Volcanoes and Mad-Dog
Bites, which I will send later on. Semper Paratds.
THINGS ONE WOULD RATHER HAVE LEFT UNSAID.
"You remember that Party at Madam Gelasma's, to hear Joachim,
Rubinstein, and the Henschelb, and De Soria—quite a small Party?"
"No; I wasn't there I" "No? Ah—well—it was very select I"
-The bite of the Hippopotamus is very painful
if you cannot make him let
"SAVOIR EAIRE EST SAVOIR VIVRE."
Dear Mk. Punch,
I, in common with, I daresay, many hundred other fathers of families,
have hanging up in my nursery, what is called a " Nursery Card; or, What to do,
and How to do it." This is simply a printed sheet which describes some of the
commoner accidents which are liable to happen to children, and gives the measures
to be followed until the arrival of the doctor. This card, however, is very incom-
plete, and might be very usefully supplemented by, let us say, the Family
Card," something after the following fashion:—
Bites.—Hippopotamus Bitet^
by reason of the enormous " fauces " at his disposal,
go his hold by fair means, throw oayenne pepper in his eyes, if you happen to have
some loose in your pocket.
Send immediately for the doctor, who will attend to the remains of the injured
limb. This accident is not so likely to occur in the house as at the Zoological
Gardens or in Equatorial Africa.
Rattlesnake Bites.—Should you be bitten by a Rattlesnake which has escaped
from a menagerie, immediately bring an action against the proprietor, and if you
sucoeed in proving negligence on his part, you will probably recover. Drink
strong brandv and water.
Burns.—When any member of the household is in flames, fling two or three
Hand Grenade Fire Extinguishers at him or her.
[Mrs. Gibson's life was saved, at St. John's, Worcester, on the 19th February last, by
the prompt use of a Hand Grenade.—Advt.]
When the conflagration is extinguished, write a report of the case to Captain
Shaw, and be careful to point out that there are some merits in imperfect com-
bustion, although it is so much abused by all scientific men of the present day.
When the patient has cooled down, you can thenproceed to the treatment for cuts.
Cuts.—-Excavate all the fragments of the Hand Grenade Fire Extinguisher
which are imbedded in the Pyrotechnist; and then smartly smack him on those
portions of his body, if any, where there is not a cut or a burn. This will restore
circulation. N.B.—Send in a claim to the Fire Insurance Office for salvage.
Cholera Morbus.—If you are attacked with choleraic spasms, and your geo-
graphical knowledge is not sufficient to inform you whether it is the Asiatic variety
Coleridge in the House of Commons.
(Adapted by Mr. Rider Cook.)
I do assure the Government benches,
(Though from such search the nostril shrinks)
"I've counted two-and-seventy stenches,
All well defined, and several stinks!"
A Good Address.—The generally well-informed Lon-
doner would consider Park Place, Hyde Park, as rather
an aristocratic position; and a house to let at a small rental
here would have attracted a considerable number of
bidders. And yet in a recent memorial this "place,"
which is only a passage, is described as "a disgrace to
the park and the neighbourhood." What a pity, with such
a name! We inspected it the other day. Here, close to
the Park, the Brown Bear hath his den, and there are
quaint old shops and houses. Across the road another
passage leads to TattersaU's, thronged by merry children
whose games will strangely interest the passenger. The
timid White Hart may be seen at the corner, and centaurs,
or horsey-men, assemble for their mid-day drink. But
it's coming down! Yet 'twas a good address.
An Opportunity Lost!—In one account of the G. 0. M.'«
meeting at the Foreign Office on Friday last, held to settle
the Waverers—(the G. 0. M.'s men havenot been behaving
Midlothianly, but Waverley)—it was stated that " The
Labour Candidates, headed by the Hon. C R, Spencee,"
&o., &c. Our Artist deeply regrets that he was not present
to immortalise such a subiect as this,—the Sons of Toil
being led by the Hon. Bobby!
"Ricx 'urn teneatis, amici f "—Friends at a distance-
keep at a distance if jrou 're going to shoot a poor Bride-
froom on the Bridal Day with rice. You might as well
ring pea-shooters, pepper him, and give him two or three
in the eye. Love is blind, but that's no excuse. So Mr.
Punch begs everybody at weddings to be sensible—except-
ing the Bride and Bridegroom, of course—and drop this
idiotic custom.
A New "Distillery Drink."—It is more or less
credibly reported (from America) that a German Chemist
has succeeded in making a flrst-rate brandy out of saw-
dust. Carpentering will be a good trade. A constant
frequenter of the shops, licensed to carpenter on the
premises, will have good reason for saying that he feels
"'rather chippy." Water-babies, at a distance, take notice.

THE O. O. M.
UP.'
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Souse of Commons, Monday Night, May 24.—A large muster of
Bishops in House of Lords to-night. Completely filled the benches
below the Gangway near the Woolsack. "Who are they?"
whispered one of the Colonials in the Gallery. "That's the Choir,"
said his companion, who hadn't been in London ten days for nothing.
"When the Choristers get too old for Westminster Abbey they come
here."
The Bishops did not Bing, neither did they talk. But they gave
a solid vote. Question was, Second Beading of Deceased Wife's
Sister Bill. St. Albans moved it, Argyll opposed it in kind of
speech that makes everyone regret the Macullum More was not
brought up to be a bishop. Brauwell made sturdy speech in
support of Bill, growling out his dislike for Theologians. Got a
little mixed in the nomenclature of wives of the Patriarchs. But, as
Marlborough said, surely some excuse. II.K. 11. sitting on cross
Benches, waiting to vote for the Second Reading, visibly drooped
before Argyll had reached his " fifthly." Cheered up under influ-
ence of Brahweix. More Lords and Bishops to speak; but when
Primate finished it was nearly Half-past Seven. If further argu-
ment submitted, dinner would be spoiled; so their Lordships voted,
and threw Bill out by 149 votes against 127.
In the Commons business opened cheerfully with conversation on
alleged iniquitous prolongation of debate on Home-Rule Bill.
Fowler (ex-Lord Mayor of London) has been saying things about
Mr. Gladstone, even writing them down for newspaper publication.
Henrt Richard came down to House determined to have this out.
Asked Premier had he seen the letter. Gladstone, with tear in his
voice, admitted he had. Could scarcely believe it possible that the
worthy Alderman could have done such a thing. O Mobert, toi
que j'aime !" Eminently a courteous and good-natured man."
Fowler moved uneasily in his seat, and hung his massive head.
His lips moved, and the ghost of a " Yah! yah I yah!" issued, but
so faintly that few heard it. Touching scene.
After this, Supply. Much talk of Secret Service Money. General
complaint among Members of severely limited acquaintance with its
disposal. Not a Member on either side able to rise, lay his hand on
his breast, and confess that he had received a sixpence.
Business done.—Votes in Supply.
Tuesday.—Haven't seen Kensington for long time. Used to be
fixed nightly in Lobby of House of Commons. Towards midnight
and later, stretched himself on bench by doorway. Looked as if he
were asleep. But if Member, thinking he might slink off without a
pair, tried to pass, Kensington always awoke and confronted him.
Pretty to see Member's altered aspect and violent assumption of
merely pacing up and down. Going home? Certainly not. Wouldn't
miss the Division for anything.
To-night, the old Whip—Lord Kensinoton still—appears in House
of Lords. Strayed in by mistake, I suppose, but being there says
few words on Durham Sunday Closing Bill. Speech of the evening
by Norton. "A dull man," Bright said of Sir Charles Addeelet.
Lord Norton flashing with originality. Having, as he told their
Lordships, voted against Second Reading of the Bui. he should now
vote for Third Reading, a balancing arrangement slightly disturbed
by a violent attack upon the measure, which was thrown out bv 97
Votes against 70. "That's what I like about the House of Lords,"
said George, Ranger. "They're absolutely impartial. Pass a Bill
through Second Reading and Committee stage and then throw it out
on Thud Reading, leaving no cause of complaint from either side."

"How do you make that out?" said Finlayson, doing the sum
his head.
In Commons adjourned Debate
on Home-Rule Bill resumed.
But first the Sage of Oueen
Anne's Gate carried Motion ad-
journing Sitting over Derby Day.
Quite touching to find the Sage
posing as a champion of old in-
stitutions, with special reference
to the Parliamentary holiday on fZ£
Derby Day. "In these days of \^
change," he said, "when institu-
tions most sacred are menaced,
let us at least hold firm to some-
thing." Isaacs, who seconded Motion,
a little heavy in his humour. "Some-
thing like what you might expect
from Noah," said Caine. Sir George
Campbell opposed Motion in most
popular speech he ever delivered. It
occupied only two minutes in the
delivery. Then Motion carried by
royal salute of 101 majority.
Business done. — More of Home-
Rule Debate.
Thursday.—Lobby filled with ex-
cited crowd. Reported that Old Par-
liamentary Hand has given a certain
turn to affairs, that the Government,
yesterday on the verge of defeat, and
the House, within measurable distance ,, .,
of Dissolution, both been saved. Mem- H- "-ch-rd-Gumsclf again).
bers come and go, button-holeing each other in
earnest conversation. At 4'40 sudden scamper.
Report gone round that Gladstone is on his
legs. Members rush in, and crowd the House.
Yes, there he is at the tabic, smiling and
bland, indicating with courteous minuteness
precise passages in a speech delivered three
weeks ago, in which Members inquisitive as to
the fate of the Land Bill, can find full informa-
tion of the Government intention with respect
to it. That not quite what was wanted. In-
tended to draw Premier into damaging and
embarrassing statements. But he last man in
the world conscious of such intention. A new
Member has asked a question, and here is his
answer. So, smiling and nodding in friendliest
manner, he resumes his seat, whilst House
chuckles with delight, and enterprising
new Member sits in bewilderment. Not
quite sure whether it is he or the Old Par-
7, hamentary Hand who has scored, but a
Vy7 little doubtful whether it is himself,
Hicks-Beach, backed by longer experi-
ence and more important position, tries it
on in another direction, but with no more
success. The Pbemier is blander than
ever, increasingly willing to be commu-
nicative, talks several moments, and sits
down without having said anything.
House resumed Committee on Arms Bill
Towards midnight proceedings interrupted
in extraordinary fashion. "Don't you,''
said Colonel Salis - Schwabe to Major
(Militia) Ashmead-Bartlett, "Don't you—hm\—{sniffing)—hear
a smell?"

J. F-nl-ys-n.

"Now you mention it," said the Major, "I
think I do."
Once mentioned, everybody, including Grand
Cross, heard the smell. Excitement grew.
Irish Members prattled on, but no one noticed.
At last, E. R. Cook, suddenly rising, protested,
as a Liberal and a Soapmaker, against the pre-
valent perfume, and moved to report progress.
Lyon Playfair pleaded the ineffectiveness of
the proposal. Sir H. Roscoe, Chairman of the
Committee on Smells, whilst drawing the line at
going down to the sewers that evening, volun-
teered to "go round," and inspect the smell.
On this understanding, Motion to Report Pro-
gress withdrawn. Bill passed through Com-
mittee, and then Randolph, rising to the height
of the occasion, moved the Adjournment of the
House, in order to relieve Members from
the necessity of breathing " the poisonous
and mephitio air."
Business done.—House smelt out.
Friday Night. — " Such larks I" as
Joe Gargery said to Pip. Randolph
and Hicks-Beach walked down to House
together disconsolate.
"Must do something," said Hicks-
BEACn. "Getting stale to accuse Old
Man of purposely delaying division. Time .
to do something striking." Don 1 >ou hcar a [

grave blunder. Accused Gladstone of
having said he would postpone Home-Rule
Bill till the winter. Gladstone shook his
head. Randolph persisted. Unfortu-
nately held newspaper report of speech in
his hand. House insisted on his reading.
Randolph obliged to correct himself.
Worse still at the end. Beach wanted
to withdraw Motion for Adjournment.
House refused permission. Parnellites
clamoured for division. Beach, Ran-
dolph, and the rest consequently obliged
to vote against their own Motion, passing
group of jeering Irishmen on the way
to Lobby. For Sir Michael Beach's
motion 1, against, 405.
"I'm not sure, Randolph," said Beach,
"that your advice was, on the whole,
judicious."
"My advice ?" said Randolph, snap-
pishly. "Why , it was yours. Don't
you address me any more. I'll never
speak to you again. After this Rigby,

Dear Mr. Punch.—You heard of my mot f Sir William said that

Wot a grand World is

to injoy it! and how

warded! Here am I

tendent of all the hole
nobel harmy of Waiters
in this here grand Xhi-
bishun, praps one of the
most {lawfully respon-
serbel persitions in the
hole Bilding. but it jest
suits me to a Tea, f or 1 'm
obligated to be always
full-drest with my white
choker of hoffice, so
there's no dishhabil work
of a morning for me, and
my speshal dooty is to do
nothink in partickler,
but to look after hevery
body helse, and make all
our warious hungary
customers nice and corn-
feral, and for this I gits
a nobel adition to my
usual Screw. I have,
menny a time and hoft,
as Amlet says, had my
dreams of hearthly appi-
ness and bliss, but they
never quite reached to
this lofty hite of reality.
All ways full drest, pretty
well allways a drinking
suminat or other with sum elustrious Forrener or another, never
nothink to pay, and with such a nincum as cums to but few.
There's one thing here as estonishes me a good deal, tho it takes
a good deal to estonish me now, and that is the wunderf ool ignorance
of the Indien race. They acshally calls our excellent Lunch,
"Tiffin," and I carat make out weather it means a good or a bad one.
They are beginning to know me now, and calls me by my honnerd
name, but ewen there they makes mistakes sumtimes, one of 'em
quite shocking me yesterday morning when he saw me by shouting
out " Salam, Robber !" meaning " Good morning, Mr. Robert," as
I was afterwards told. And one carat be angry with 'em, pore
fellers! for their gross hignoranoe, for they are wunderfoolly perlite
and always smiles at me wen they meets me. I have made
acquaintance with one of their lower orders who speaks English
pretty well considering he's ony a pore Forringer. He asked me
to give him a few lessons in spelling, witch in coarse I did, and
werry greatfool he was, tho', strange to say, he always larfed
wile having 'em. In return he told me some reel staggerers about
his masters. He says that their partickler customs won't allow
them not to eat Beef or Pork, ony Mutton and Lam! I fixed
my hernest gaze of dowt on his sworthy wisage wen he told me
this, so he sea, watch 'em at their meals and Bee for yourself. So
I did, and it is quite trew! Wot a reel sacrifice! I wunders
how many hungry Englishmen coud make it, say for a duzzen years
or so, and with werry cold winters. My f rend went on to say as that
Cows was treated with such respeo in Injia that many of the werry
pore natives would like to exchange places with 'em, but as this
was after dinner I didn't feel at all angry with him for trying to
swindle me so shamefoolly.
We are gitting on wunderfully well here, and thinks nothink of
having sum 30 or 40 thowsand peeple in a day, and as far as I
can judge, most on 'em ether cums hungry and thusty, or gits
hungry and thusty afore they leaves, and acts according, so my
pore fellers has plenty to do, but they sticks to it like men, and I
trewly hopes, tho I am not pussonally concerned, that the thortless
public won't forget 'em wen they pays their little bills.
The grate atraction for tho Fare Sects continues to be the
Injean Shorls, and I reelly don't wunder at it, they scums more

AFTER THE FEDERAL LECTURE AT THE UNITED
SERVICE INSTITUTION.
(Ideas picked up thereat by our own Impressionist.)
1. That two-thirds of the audience had come to see the Prince of
Wales rather than to listen to Captain Colomb the Lecturer.
2. That it is not easy to take in statistics on the spur of the
moment, even if assisted with enormous charts covered with figures.
3. That England is smaller than India, and Australasia ever so
much bigger than both of them put together.
4. That in spite of this, appearances are deceptive, and that con-
sequently, from a military point of view, everybody lives in India
and nobody in Australasia.
5. That if we think we are going to get any soldiers from the
Colonies to speak of for the next twenty years, we shall find ourselves
wofully mistaken.
6. That a single Australian, if drawn from the fields, would by his
absence depopulate a territory of some thousand square miles, and
cost at his ordinary wages about three and twopence an hour.
7. That, according to Captain Colomb, the Post Office has been up
to some very unpatriotic dodge in connection with the South
Canadian Railway.
8. That the Colonists present were most pleased at those parts of the
lecture in which their inability to carry out anything was admitted.
9. That everybody cheered to the echo anything that sounded like
swagger, but were most reticent in their applause when the question
of ways and means was approached.
10. That the subject of Federal Defence has yet to be dealt with,
in spite of Captain Colomb's well-intended remarks.
11. That the Duke of Cambridge's appeal for funds was safe, if
not exactly appropriate.
12. That Captain Colomb's lecture would have been longer and
more intelligible had not the Prince of Wales had to catch a train.
AN AMBROSIAL CONCERT.
It was something like a concert at the Albert Hall on Saturday
with Messrs. Santley and Lloyd (Edward, not Arthur) instead of
Sims Reeves, who could'nt come; Madame Trebelli and Madame
Adelina Patti—who, by the way, is not engaged by Mr. Cusins, as
Borne one Btated last week, but by Mr. Ambrose Austin, who
should be Patti'd on the back for giving us such a rich musical treat
as this. The Albert Hall was Ail-but chock full. Trebelli was in
a glorious dress. Patti in a simple, child-like, and bland costume.
An afternoon concert for the lady singers who take Madame
Tbebelli'8 view of it must be an expensive affair. We didn't see
whether Mr. Santley had a new coat for the occasion, but he had
his old splendid voice, which was as fresh as ever. Charming to Bee
the politeness of the two ladies in a pretty little strife on leaving
the platform, as to which voice should go hrst. Patti insisted on
Trebelli being the one, and so the latter yielded. It is worth
going some distance to hear Mr. Edward Lloyd sing "My Queen,
My Queen!" Paplni's delicate violin playing was delicious, and
the Orchestra, personally conducted by Mr. Cusins—one of our own
Country Cusins—gave us a perfect rendering of Liszt's Rhapsodie
Hongroise, A. 1. Success to the Ambrosial Concerts.
"A WORD OF WELCOME!"
The Amateurs at the Nathanal Theatre (Novelty Theatre, Great
Queen Street) did well and, we hope, with good results for that
deserving charity, Lady Constance Stanley's Home for Homeless
Children. The programme was Byron's Married in Haste and
Herbert Gardner's Cousin Zachary. We sent an Amateur Critic
who reported that Mr. Quintin Twiss was "most amusing,"
Mr. Charles Lamb " very good ;" that Mr. Eustace Ponsonby was
"good," that Miss Measob (who is not an amateur at all) "acted
admirably, and looked very pretty," and that Mrs. Conyer D'Abcy
was "gooa." Our Amateur Critic had nothing but praise for Cousin
Zachary, in which he thought Captain Gooch was " vastly diverting,"
and Miss Maud Catchcart (surely not an Amateur, eh?) "very
nice and pretty." An appropriate prologue had been written for
the occasion by Mr. Clement Scott, and was as well delivered as a
cricket-ball by Spofforth,—right into the left-hand breast pocket
of the audience where the heart and purse meet,—by Mr. Claude
Ponsonby of the A. D. C. The Nathanal Amateurth of the Nathanal
Novelty Theatre have made a good thtart. Go on and prothper.
What is He?—There is a Singer who announces himself as
"Monsieur Scoyello, the Great American Tenor." Oblige us with
his nationality.

ARCHER UP!
Mr.W. Archer has fitteda quill dart, and, under cover of the Fort-
nightly, has taken a shot at London Theatrical Managers. He says,
in effect, why don't you gentlemen give your orders—not for your
theatres, with which you are sufficiently liberal, but for pieces by
competent English dramatists. As a dramatist, with much else to do
besides dramatising, I am inclined to agree with Mr. Archer, who
would be a very fair critic, as critics go, but for certain exceptions,
which, having already stated that I am a dramatist, it is unnecessary
to specify. But bring it to a point: it is a matter of terms.
Manager says, " Yes, I won't make any difficulty about terms, if I like
the piece when it's finished." Quite so: but this isn't giving an order.
I don't say to my tailor, "I '11 pay you for the coat when it is done,
if I like it." Nor is it understood in the contract. The coat is tried
on again and again until it is made to fit, and then it is finished. If
managers would do this, it would be fair enough.
But what is a manager to do while the piece is being written?
What do I do when my new coat is being made? Wear an old one.
Yes, the old piece may be worn out, and of the two or three new ones
which the dramatists nave in hand—being made "to order "—not one
may be ready for production: for a play is not ready until it has
been thoroughly rehearsed. It is indeed true to say that no play
should be considered as completed until after it has been thoroughly
rehearsed. The written play, however good, is seldom the acted one.
What is read to the manager is never exaotly what the manager,
author, and actors present to the public. A manager doesn't like
to buy a pig in a poke. Formerly it was different: though the
grumbling about French plays then was just as much as there is now.
Very few English dramatists can afford to write "on spec." Those who
can afford don't do it, as without the order and the certainty of their
production being accepted, half the spirit is taken out of their work.
Supposing a dramatist, under inspiration, writes a light comedy,
he looks round for the opening. Where? Say he finds the ohance;
he reads it. and the manager approves. Then comes the delicate
matter of terms," which, in France, is settled by the legal tariff of
the Dramatic Authors' Society, and thus half the difficulty is removed.
Suppose manager and author agree. Then, when can it be produced?
Well, just at that moment out comes a big Parisian success. Manager
has seen it. It is " a big thing," a " certainty," " safe!" Manager
weighs the risk; the English author's piece being untried, may
prove a failure; the French piece is already a success, and will
start with a prestige. Manager cannot hesitate, and other managers
will snap it up. So he compromises. English author puts his original
piece aside, and undertakes to adapt the new French piece himself.
II faut virre, of which he sees the necessity. The adaptation turns
out successful, and somehow that original piece of his, on looking
over it again, seems to have lost its first freshness. It has been
written on the chaDce, and the chance has gone by. I don't see
how to remedy the difficulty, whioh must always exist where there
is small confidence on the part of the manager, and nothing but
chance to encourage the dramatist.
If the terms here, as in France, were legally fixed, so that the
author would be relieved from haggling and bargaining, and were
there a Dramatic Authors' Society, like the French one, to enforoe the
fulfilment of contraots, there would be some inducement for dra-
matists to write " on spec"; but as this is not the case, the. drama-
tists become adapters, speculate on their own account in French
pieces, do journalists' work, write pot-boilers for magazines, and
nave a turn at sharp dramatio critioism. "0 cursed spite!" but it
isn't Mr. Archer who has been born to set it right.

admirers with his own portrait, one of the Grosvenor Gems. As
it was the first that had ever been done of him, the donors thought of
inscribing it, "His First Form, presented by the Sixth Form and
Others." For a motto they had prepared the well-known Shakspearian
quotation about " Grim-visaged Warre ;" but this was rejected in
favour of " The pomp and circumstance of glorious Warre," which
was considered more in keeping with the accessories of the picture.

MAJOR O'BOBADIL INTERVIEWED.
Ode Representative called on Major O'Bobadil, M.P.
"If you please, Major," said Our Representative, putting his head
in at the door,—but before he could utter another word, a stentorian
voioe thundered out,
"Come in, ye spyin' spalpeen! Come in, and don't be afther

An Oranobment in Black and Yellow.
lettin' in the oowld air on the loynllest boosom that palpitates beneath
my summer Ulster! Come in, I tell ye!"
It was the Major himself, seated in full Orange uniform, black and
yellow, wearing his oocked-hat and feathers, having just returned
from a secret review held not a hundred miles away from the pre-
cincts of the Pall Mall Gazette office.
"I beg a thousand pardons, Major," Our Representative com-
menced, most politely, " for disturbing you in your sanctum—but"
"What, in the divil's name, d'ye call a sanctum t" interrupted
the Major. "Is it a Moody-and-Sankey-tum you mane? It's no
more a sanctum than you are yourself. It's my Armoury."
"Your Armagh, eh?" inquired Our Representative, preparing to
make a note of it in his pocket-book.
The Major was very irate. "Don't pun here, Sorr. Put up your
pencil and paper. If it's pistols you want, they 're here handy"
(and pointing to a formidable pair of revolvers in his belt, he
added, significantly), "and there's more where thim came from.
So behave, now. What '11 you take? Grog and gunpowder?
Brandy and bullets? Give it a name! Can't ye spake, ye drivelling
son of a quill-driving pen-wiper, the only wiper that Saint Patrick—
more power to his elbow, and confusion to his inimies that call them-
selves his frinds—didn't drive out of Green Erin. What '11 ye take,
man alive?"
Our Reporter humbly submitted that, if it was all the same to the
Major, he would like to take a chair.
"Take it, thin, and what ull ye take with it? Dhrink I mane."
Here the Major opening a cupboard in the Armoury, produced a stone
jar, and acouple of tumblers. "There, me bhoy," said the gallant
Major, "there's threble proof for you! There's the rale ould
potheen that's been in me family for ginnyrations—I moight say,
for whiskey-rations, if ye'd onderstand me. —Our Reporter bowed
and smiled as intelligently as possible—"and betune ourselves it's
niver paid the Queen—God bliss her and oonfound their knavyish
and armyish tricks too—it niver paid Her Majestt a single shilling!
And why would it? O me Country!" exclaimed the Major, filling
a large glass and holding it between his right eye and the window.
"0 me Country, I love thy stills! Fill up, man alive; there's not
a headache in a noggin of it." And he poured out a tumblerful
for Our Reporter, who with a profusion of thanks begged to be
excused on the score of having recently taken the pledge.
"Taken the pledge!" retorted the Major, scornfully, "Av coorse
ye've taken the pledge, and ye'11 take another before I've done with
you. Down on your knees and take this glass of glorious potheen in
your right hand, and the book of the Orange Constitooshuns in the
other. Now wait till I administer the oath, or ye '11 niver come onto'
this alive anyhow."
Our Reporter says that considering he is a teetotaller, he is
astonished to find how very slight was the effect of the Major's extra
strong potheen on him. In fact beyond inducing a rather pleasant
feeling of thirst and dispelling certain old-fashioned prejudices
against whiskey-drinking, ne was not aware of any great difference
between this and water.*
"What's the strength of the Orange Army, Major?" asked Our
Representative. He considered awhile, and then, after examining
the keyholes of the doors, opening and shutting the windows and all
the cupboards, and firing a pistol up the chimney, he replied in a
hoarse whisper:—
"The strength of the Orange Army is superhuman. There's three
million ten thousand and sixty-five—it may be sixty-six, but I '11
not risk any exaggeration—all ready at this blessed minute in full
uniform, every stitch of which they put together themselves, buttons
and all, includin'the boots. Here's to the glorious mimory!" Our
Representative drank the toast, whatever it was, and he proceeded—
"Three million ten thousand and sixty-five, or sixty-six, are lyin'
down in ambush within the limits of the United Kingdom—United,
ha! ha! Here's to the Union!" Again the Reporter honoured the
sentiment, and the Major continued—" They're only waiting for the
wured of command."
"Indeed!" said Our Reporter, deeply interested, "And who's to
give it?"
"Who should give it?" he retorted, proudly drawing himself up
to his full height, and squaring his elbows as he threw himself back
in his chair, and eyed our Representative with an air of scornful
defiance that challenged contradiction. "And who should give the
wured of command but Major Robert Michael O'Bobadil, of Castle
Bobadil, Ballyhony?"
"Of course," Our Representative assented; "only I thought
there was some talk of Lord Wolselet"
"Ah, get out wid ye!" exclaimed the Major. "Where'd he be
beside Major O'Bobadil, not to spake of Colonel Warring of the
Portadown Popguns! Take my word for ut, that it's only 'Great
cry and very little Wool-seley' in that quarter."
"Then the Oranges—I beg pardon, I should have said the Orange
Army, will look entirely to you?" asked Our Reporter.
"They will, Sorr, and divil a better could they look to in the time
of imergency. Drink, me boy! The Queen!"
Our Reporter, though the most abstemious of men, could not
refuse this loyal toast. When the cheering, which was led by the
Major, had subsided, Our Representative pressed the gallant warrior
to tell him all about it.
The Major hesitated for a minute, and then, having extracted
from Our Reporter an oath of inviolable secresy.t he said,—
"I've already informed ye of our numbers. Well, Sorr, beyond
the reglar troops, which, betune you and me and the bedpost, I
drill every blessed morning, flying from one spot to the other and
carrying all before me, there are a corps of Single Vivandyars, all
armed to the teeth, to defend the baggage and accompany the troops
with transports—such transports, my boy! The Ladies! "—he
paused to drink this toast, to which Our Reporter responded, in a
neat and telling speech, after which the Major resumed—" And there
are the Marriea Vivandyars, with their infants in arms,—and thou-
sands of raw recruits daily joining the standard of Loyal Ulster,
and wearing the Orange, to fight till all's blue. There's not a man,
woman, or child amongst us but goes through the double-barrelled
Sun and single-sword exercise before he gets up in the morning. In
elfast we live in squares, and the military bands are forming them-
selves into playtoons from morning to night. We've guns and
trumpets and swords and sabres and pistols and blunderbusses galore'
We've cannon and mitrailleuses and infantry and cavalry, artillery
and distillery, such as ye '11 rarely see in any capital of the world."
"And how about the Commissariat?" asked Our Representative.
* There was no difference, it was so well mixed. By the way it is as well
to mention that we did not see Our Reporter again for nearly a week after
this interview, as he had been, unfortunately, as he explained, laid up with a
very bad cold and bronchial attack, which had left him shaking like an
aspen, and had drawn the colour from his cheeks to his nose, " which," he
said, " was the last stronghold of influenza in his system." "Mv nose," the
poor fellow who had sufl'ered so much in our service explained, "is the we«k
point in my system. If anything is the matter with me, it shows itself there.
But I would not disappoint my employers," he murmured, with tears of
gratitude in his eyes, " and so, though I ought to be in bed at this moment, I
have brought you the report of my interview with the Major. The oath
haunts me, ana 'tis at the risk of my life I 've revealed these secrets. And I
know that you will consider this fact in my honorarium. For this is the last
report I may ever write for you." Need we say that, with this probability
in view, our heart was touched, and we Well, no matter, ne left us

before he swallowed the whale, and this talking's mighty dry work.
But, if ye '11 stay and pick a bit with an old soldier, I'll show you

Our Representative represented that his wife always expected him
to tea, but that, in this instance,—might he ask what the Major had
for dinner?
"Ye might, and I'll tell you," replied the Major, as Norah
rapidly laid the table for two, and brought in the first dish. "'Tis
the very dinner for a rebellious stomach," said the Major, lifting;
the cover off, and revealing a large fish. "See, now—'tis a baked

chorus. So he was not shot. A pleasant evening, and left sitting

THERE AND BACK IN THE "BACCHANTE":
Or, Wluxt It Might have been—if Unedited.
April 1.—Up at Four, a.m., and tell old Dalton who is up too.
with a volume of Natural History for explanation, that we have haa
our first sight of the Sea Serpent. He says that, as we have already
seen that other wonder of the deep, the " Flying Dutchman," we must
describe this accurately for him in our Diaries. Here goes. Noted it at
first following leisurely aft. It appeared to be entirely the stock Sea
Serpent we had seen in picture-books, and of the penny-plain-two-
pence-coloured character we had always been instructed to associate
with it. We couldn't make it out very well, owing to the early
light, but, as far as we could judge, it seemed to be about a mile and
a quarter in length, fifteen feet thick, and covered with green tinsel
scales; and as it pursued the ship in huge coils arching above the sea
at least seventy feet into the distance, and raising its great head
with its illuminated eyes, and firey jaws wide open, as if it would
devour the red ensign floating at our stern, it certainly looked a
most remarkable creature.
The Captain had the two-and-a-half ton gun run out, and several
shots were fired into its mouth, apparently without producing any
effect upon it whatever. After a short time the sun rose, and it
suddenly disappeared. Made a pen-and-ink sketch of it for old
Dalton, who soon got hold of us, and read us several chapters about
the large marine animals which it appears inhabit these seas.
The only curious coincidence we noticed about the apparition
of the monster to us was its date, which, as will be seen above,
was, oddly enough, on the morning of April the First. But we
merely mention this by the way, and so old Dalton must make of
our account whatever he can. Avoid him the rest of the morning
by hiding in the bottom of the steam pinnace.
The day however advancing, some island oomes in sight and as we
near it we are eager to go ashore and see the fun. Know that old
Dai/ton will be down on us with statistics, and try to improve the
occasion the moment we do, so we keep out of his way. Hear that a
lot of Albatrosses are now following the ship, and go aft and have
fine sport, enticing them with legs of mutton and then catching them
with a lasso. Collar one splendid fellow that measures'seventeen feet
across from wing to wing, and are just setting-to to skin him, when
old Dalton comes up, and says, if we mention the circumstance in
our Diary, we are to be sure to write out in full the natural history and
habits of the bird, and lug in a lot of supplementary information
about the larger sea-fowl generally. Catch us doing it that's all!
However we can't get out of the Ancient Mariner, which he reads
to us right through twice. Manage to escape him at last, and as the
boata are starting for shore get into the Captain's gig, and think we
have done him this time, when he spies us out, drops down and takes
his place at our side armed as usual with Lempriere, Smith's
Dictionary of Antiquities, Bright's History of England, Haydn's
Dictionary of Dates, and the Universal Gazetteer.
Don't ask the name of the place, for fear of stirring him up, but
he is too sharp for us, and volunteers it, following it up with no end
of information about its imports and exports, ethnological history,
native produce, fauna, and other matters. There is a volcano to be
visited. Wish we could have brought a barrel of gunpowder to roll
down the crater. Are suggesting this, in a whisper, to two of the
Naval Cadets, when old Dalton fires off at a tangent about Etna and
the site of ancient Syracuse. Says it resembles that of the town we
are approaching, and quotes a lot of Tacitus to prove his point.
Then he goes on to the wool and sugar trades. Nothing will stop
him. Says we must be well up in these, and reads us copious articles
on both subjects from the Universal Gazetteer, finishing up with a
detailed history of the doings of Admiral Benbow in these waters in
the early part of the last century. Wish he would drop the Uni-
versal Gazetteer overboard. Are obliged to appear to be attending to
what he is saying, though are straining all our ears to catch a capital
story one of the Lieutenants is telling the Captain about a rat-tailed
snake, for which the island is famous, who swallows another fellow
nearly as big as himself whole at one gulp. Should like to Bee that
come off, immensely.
Hooray! landed at last. Capital fun. Are to be carried up to
Government House in things like hansoms turned backwards with
their wheels off, suspended on long poles. We mount ours, and
prepare to race, and excite natives to start before old Dalton comes
up. But he catches us just as we are off, and points out to us,
running alongside, that there is a certain similarity between the
vehicles on which we are mounted and the Roman quadriga, which
he begs we will take note of. We reply by crying out, "Hikb!
Hikb.'" to the bearers, which means that they are to get on faster,
which they do, and we leave old Dalton scrambling on after us,
breathless "behind with Smith's Antiquities. Then we put on a spurt.
It is a splendid broad road of fine yellow sand, bounded on each
side by huge cabbage-looking plants, something like what you see in
a transformation scene, that open and. show women inside. Glad old
Dalton isn't here to tell us what they are. Hurry on, and keep
well ahead of him. Capital race. Catching up the Captain. By
keeping up "Hikb! Hikb!" and giving the bearers a pocket-knife
and bits of slate-pencil, manage to pass him, and come in first.
Captain third. Lieutenant and Cadets fourth and fifth, and old
Dalton a bad eighth and last. Run right into Governor without
seeing him, but he is a cheery and jolly old chap, and seems pleased
to see us. Asks us what we would like to do. Say what we most
wish to do is to see that rat-tailed snake swallow another fellow
almost as big as himself at one gulp. Says he '11 try and manage
it for us after dinner. Kind of him. Rove about. Come across a
wild pig. Chase him into a fountain.
Pass old Dalton's room and see the Gazetteer and Lempriere lying
on his table. Put the former in his bed, together with an astro-
nomical telescope, and arrange Lempriere with a prickly cactus plant
as a booby-trap over his door.
Dinner capital. Champagne and sweets first-rate. After it is
over all turn out under the verandah to see the natives go through
the Chokeyeti or Medicine-Thump dance. Old Dalton down on us
onoe more. Has got hold of the Antiquities again, and wants us to
observe that the measure of the Thump dance, which is continued by
a sort of swaying of the right leg coming down at unexpected
moments, after a sort of double shuffle, with a rhythmical thud, is
of classic origin, and strikingly resembles that of the Bacchic
orgies at Salamis. described in nis annals by Alkxfron, the disciple
of Herodotus. Don't see it. Strikes us as most like a Pantomime
rally when the clown has made a butter-slide and every one goes
down on it in turns. Have seen it dozens of times at Drury Lane
and tell him so. Try to get away from him, but he follows us up
with history of Early Greece, and pursues us into the grounds in
which we take refuge, and eventually manage to trip him up by
setting string-traps across the paths.
Finish up with fireworks, and are presented by Chief with an
elephant's tusk apiece and a quart of Yasherhb, or Thump-dance
wine, usually drunk in honour of these occasions, in an earthen pot.
Don't exactly know what to do with them, so put the tusks into Old
Dalton's bed, and add the Yasherhb to the booby-trap. Altogether a
first-rate day.
Say good-night and retire. Take off our boots and dance the horn-
pipe several times in our bed-room—then listen. There it goes!
Thump!—thud!—splash!—and a shout. Hooray! Lempriere, the
cactus, and the Yasherhb have done it, and old Dalton is caught.
Quite a first-rate day. Post up our Diaries, then to bed in fits of
laughter.
THOUGH LOST TO SITE, TO MEMORY DEAR.
For the sake of "Auld Lang Syne," the ground round about
Addison Road, the site of his own particular railway, is sacred to
Mr. Punch. In the years that are gone the Sage of Fleet Street
used to suggest schemes for utilising the ground of that lice, which
is now one of the most prosperous in the world. He proposed, for
instance, that the telegraph wires should be used for drying clothes,
and the mould between the rails for growing cabbages. Thus, it may
be said, that for about half a century he has taken the neighbour-
hood under his own protection. Under these circumstances he would
like to know to what use the hideous building now being erected
within a stone's throw of the Addison Road station is to be put.
Something has been said about a rival to the Agricultural Hall (a
speculation which does not strike Mr. Punch as a particularly
promising investment): but surely West Kensington might be
spared this infliction. Is it too late to find another site P

ACTION AND HIS HOUNDS.
An, hapless hunter! Old in woodland art,
Strong with the spear, unerring with the dart,
In many a chace and long your foot hath led,
Through coppice tangle ana o'er torrent-bed,
The heated hunt. Your hounds, an ordered
pack,
Prompt to the whistle, docile to the crack,
To voioe and whip responsive, on the trail
Dared not to falter, and knew not to fail.
How many a quarry have those dogs pulled
down!
How many a chace hath raised your high
renown
For valour and for venery' And now,
When years have thinned the honours of your
brow,
When the horns sound for one high-crowning
day,
As in old Calydon; when the keen bay,
Familiar made through many-memoried years,
In chiming chorus should salute your ears,
Action's hounds revolt, and turn to rend
Their mighty master. Man's most faithful
friend
Fang thus the Chief he followed? What
black spell
Of angered Artemis, what fortune fell,
What huntsman's error, or what strange
attack
Of rabies in that erst obedient pack,
Brought on this tragic turn? Is yours the
fault,
Aged Actieon, brought to sudden halt.
As of the hunter hunted, by the hounds
Who often through the forest's leafy bounds
Swift answering to your rallying shout have
rushed
Against the flaming pard or angry-tushed
Aud bristling boar at bay? Lyneeus leads
Against you, and your call no longer heeds,
Keen he of eye and fang, of Midland strain;
Vain coaxing cry, and strident menace vain
To stay his angry onset, or assuage
The venomed vigour of his rabid rage,
"fis grip to grip, Aetaeon! Argus too,
The stolid faithful hound of Stygian hue,
Slow foot but teeth tenacious, turns at last
And makes his chief his quarry. Not o'er fast,
But keen of scent, if shifty, Proteus lends
His yelp against you, and his gorge distends
In long-stored, long suppressed, loud anger.
Next
Comes Caledonian Spartus, vastly vext
As with a vertigo of frantic fear.
And others many, Amarynthus dear,
And blatant Bores, whimpering Banus, all
The pack's gregarious rebels large and small,
More than are named by old Apoilodorus,
Bark in the background in a cruel chorus,
Alike intent to pull Actason down,
In the great chase that his long course should
crown.
MODERN JACK.

And resoued Poll and Nancy.
What gone! all gone! Alas! alack!
What blight has fallen on Modern Jack!
Ah! is it that his ancient fire
Fierce competition smothers,
That he beholds with gloomy ire
His Scandinavian brothers!

Which holds him shall grow stronger,
And that his old famed British deck

COMPARING NOTES.
The fifth Richter Concert was of a less alluring nature than usual.
Dear old Charles Halle, it is true, came forward once more as a
pianist, and played with all his old precision and delicacy the solo
part in the Beethoven Concerto. He got a warm reception; and
Madame Norman Nkruda was present to do honour to her newly-
married lord. Mr. F. H. Cowen's Concert Overture in D, composed
for this year's Liverpool Exhibition, was also given- but—well,
generally speaking, the proceedings were rather tame—lor Richter.
The sixth programme of the Philharmonio Society was extremely
interesting, and those who like plenty for their money, got it at
length,—at very considerable length. The first part alone occupied
nearly two hours. Perhaps when a bishop has perished of exhaustion,
concert-givers will begin to realise that from eight to ten is quite
long enough for the proper enjoyment of serious music. It has one
merit—it induces a delightful thirst, and an appreciative hunger.
The principal features were the performance, by Franz Ondricee,
of Beethoven's Violin Concerto, and the production of Moszeowsei's
new Orchestral Suite, composed expressly for the Society. Mr. Ondricee
has long since achieved distinction as a fiddler, and his playing of the
favourite Concerto was remarkable for refinement and correctness. In
the slow movement he was both tender and true. He is a real Bohemian
Boy. On the other hand, Mr. Moszeowsei, if not hailing from
Moscow's sky, is at least a native of Russian Poland. His new Suite
is one of the most original and delightful bits of music that have
been recently introduced. Quite the sweetest thing in Suites.
Mr. Punch loves to recognise merit such as it displays, and he
therefore votes solid for Moszeowsei, and crowns the head of the
Pole with laurels.
There was not a spare seat at Covent Garden when our own dear
Albani made her rentrie as Marguerite in Faust. She was in
excellent voice. But please, Madame Albani, why will you pause so
long on your most fetching" notes? It is generous, it is done
with the best intention, but, take for example, when Marguerite
meets her lover, and ought to reply to his offer of seeing her home in
the quietest and simplest manner—isn't your method at that moment
too theatrical, artistically considered? And, therefore, is it worthy
of our own Albani? The rest of the cast included Signor Gatarre
as Faust—-at his best, though tremulous with the " vibrato;" Signor
Monti, a rough-and-ready Mephistopheles—with a tendency to sing
flat—and Mdlle. Lubatovi as Siebel.
A capital rendering of the same Opera was given by the Carl Rosa
troupe, with Georgina Burns as Marguerite. She got on famously,
especially in " The Garden" scene (though played at'' The Lane "),
and her rich voice was charmingly modulated in the pathetic music
of the prison, where the unfortunate heroine recalls one by one the
melodies of happier days. Mr. James Sattvage was Valentine, and
Mr. Ben Da vies, Faust. They did credit to their respective charac-
ters. Mr. Barrington Foote made a somewhat ridiculous Mephis-
topheles. He had little or no " spice of the devil" in his composition
or expression. His voioe is not powerful enough, nor can he go low
enough to raise a suggestion of Inferno. Mibs Marian Burton was

<v—•

a picturesque and almost ideal Siebel, so far as appearance went.
Her singing, too, was delightful, but she is at times apt to forget
that she is acting a part. The fact of Valentine's being found
dead in the streets appeared to have no interest for her, her de-
meanour at this point l>eing casual in the extreme. In this Opera,
and especially in Figaro's marriage, her comely face was too highly
coloured. "Burton s Anatomy lends itself to the appearance of
the chubby Cherubino. But, Miss Marian, do spare the rouge
and_ hare's-foot; I adjure you, as Cherubino, in ancient and choice
Italian, " O Formose puer, nimium ne crede colori!"
Madame Julia Gatlord as Susannal presented a marked contrast
to Miss Burton in the matter of colouring. Why is her complexion,
instead of being unduly rubicund, unduly delicate, not to say con-
sumptive? Why will Julia be so peculiar P She can beat most of
'em "by chalks, so.why do it with bismuth? But La Gatlord is
a very lively Lady, and an excellent Susanna,—this is the opinion
not only of the Elders—which in the case of Susanna, one must dis-
trust—but of the Youngers also. Almaviva was played by Mr. James
Sauvage, who in the spoken parts talked with a charming brogue.
Could he have been an Irishman in Spanish dress? Evidently the
O' Connor Don. Don Basilio (Mr. Charles Lyall) ought not to wear
a moustache, but he was distinctly good in other respects. Mr. Bar-
rington Foote gave "non piu andrai" with great effect, but he
was decidedly too English—a London Figaro rather than the Spanish
Edition.
In the Garden.—The Huguenots introduced a debutante in
Mile. Elena Teodorini, a magnificent dramatic soprano. Of course
she took the part of Valentino, and could not fail to provoke the
utmost enthusiasm. Always artistio, and never seeking to " shout
down " her oolleagues in concerted pieces, while simply grand in her
solos, Mile. Teodorini played the arduous character from first to

Kaoul. "I Kaoully must leave you." End of Duct. Raoul takes a flying
leap out of window. Valentina faints. Curtain.
last with consummate ability. Signor Gatarre was Haoul di
Nangis. He declaimed with passionate fervour, and brought down
the house with bursts of extraordinary volume. The scene in which
he refuses the hand of Mile. Teodorini—when he says, in effect,
"you shall not be my Valentina"—was excellently well sung and
acted by all concerned, Miss Ella Russell, as Marguerite de Valois,
contributing not a little to its
effect with a very sweet and
flexible voice. Madame Scalchi
made her first appearance this
season, and was warmly wel-
comed as Urbano. Nothing
could have been much better
than her singing and demeanour.
Signor Pinto, a powerful and
resonant bass, gave point to
Marcello's music. which
sounded well upon his 'grand
organ. He is rather a Quart o'
Bass than a Pinto Bass. (Ahem!
let us to supper.)
Again in the Lane.—Madame
Marie Roze gave a splendid
specimen of the half - savage
petulance of the spoilt Car-
men in the last Aet. She
played as well as she sang.
What a lovely Act this is from
a musical point of view! and Rentrie of Madame Scalchi as Urbano.
how exquisitely fanciful is the She's Scalchi-lated to be one of the most
ballet-music! 2 propos, Her brilliant Pages in Operatic History.
Majesty the Queen has taken a box for the Season, d la Rosa
Bonheur! but how is she to profit by it in Scotland, unless a
telephone is brought into play? She can't do it. Lord Randolph
has just telegraphed to say it's a Balmoral impossibility. Madame
Roze's Manon was as bright as ever, the drinking song sparkling as
champagne, and the soupcon of Mr. McGuckin as effective as when

this old joke was new, only a year ago."
NlBBELUNGLET.
P.S.—The Operatic Week wound up with Tin Ballo in Maschera,
excellently given at Covent Garden. Mile. Valda, as Oscar, was
charming. Signor Gatarre could not be bettered nowadays as the
Duke, but he has not the delicaoy that made Mario's E scherzo e
follia such a memorable triumph. The Ballo must be repeated; it
was a decided hit. Remarks reserved.

MR. PUNCH, THE "TIMES," AND THE PRINCES.
In Thursday's Times its French Correspondent, presumably M. de Blowitz, the Inimitable
(whose portrait in the Salon is a speaking and a writing likeness) said:—
"It is stated that among the friends of the Prince living in England, there are some who have
already offered him the most cordial hospitality. The respectful welcome which awaits him on the
other side of the Channel will mitigate the pain of exile."
And while he was writing this, Mr. Punch's Cartoon Junior was being issued urbi et orbi,
wherein was portrayed Britannia—Mr. P. modestly effacing himself—place aux dames !—
welcoming the Princes, to her shores, should pince-nez'd, shortsighted Madame la Republique
evict them.
This was Britannia's "compensation for disturbance." Mr. Punch shakes M. de Blowxtz
by the hand—bonne poignee de main, cher et spirituel M. de B.—and endorses his sentiments.
The last two lines of the above-quoted paragraph Mr. Punch will ever remember when he
has to cross from Dover to Calais (by Inticta
for choice) and will be buoyed up by the
anticipation of "the respectful welcome
which awaits him on the other side of the

Of course we shall be delighted to see the

that, "La reine Victoria a accentui set ten-
dances antifran^aises et ses preferences ger-

allow a few law-abiding well-behaved

must be in a parlous state. As Lord Salis-
bury did more for the chances of the second

but injudicious speech about twenty years'

explanations and arguments put forward on
the Ministerial side, so the Republic has, by
this stupid act of expulsion, done more good
to the Monarchical cause than the Princes

Hear! Liberals should pin their faith on

to vote for a measure because a certain man
proposes it, is coercion and tyranny to be
abhorred by all liberal-minded men. Tet

THE GRAND STAIRCASE.
WHO GOES HOME ? »
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRA CTHD FKOM
THE DIARY OF TOBY. M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, May 31.—Speaker in Chair;
Mace on the table; Members ranged in places right and left of
Speaker. Henry Fowler on his legs, making admirable speech in
favour of Second Reading of Government of Ireland Bill. Every-
thing as usual, and yet the real interest of the night centres outside.
Lobby filled with excited groups of Members discussing some event.
A constant stream flows towards Telegraph-Office. The Conserva-
tives are spasmodically cheerful, though between the bursts of cheer-
fulness come prolonged intervals of sadness. The Liberals uninter-
ruptedly melancholy. Only the Parnellites buoyant. "What's the
matter r" I asked Wood all, coming upon the scene towards Six
o'Clock.
"Matter P" he said, in broken voice. "Why, murder's the
matter, Dissolution's the matter. One of the best Parliaments ever
elected, led by the most effective Ministry of modern times, with a
perfect Secretary for War and a Surveyor-General of the Audience,
of whom I will not further speak, suddenly, cruelly, smothered in
the earliest months of their existence, before they are, as one may
say, out of their long clothes."
Turned out, on inquiry, that Chambeblaln and his friends have
met and determined to vote against the Home-Rule Bill. That is
taken as sealing its doom. The Bill is as good as dead, and with it
dies the Parliament which met in January, and the New Member is
wrested from a place which he has learned to love. Small wonder
that the House itself was for the time the least attractive centre
of interest. Nevertheless, there was, as there has been throughout
the long debate, some uncommonly good speaking, beginning with
Fowlek, followed by Stouet, cheered, for
the first time, through a speech full of point;
Macnaghten, whom the House hears too
rarely; Gray, who recalled some awkward
reminiscences for the consideration of Cham-
BEBLAtN; and Colonel Hoghes-Hallett,
who, literally taking off his coat, and disposin
of his hat and stick, made a desperate
attack on the Bill.
Business done.—Resumed Debate on
Home-Rule Bill.
Tuesday. — Another great night.
House crowded from floor to topmost
range of gallery seats. Chamberi \ in
to speak. Everyone anxious to hear
what he would say, and how he would
say it. Both manner and matter un-
commonly good. Perhaps, on the whole,
best speech he has yet made in the House.
Reception decidedly chilling. A few
friends below the Gangway cheered him
when he rose, but Members on both Bides
for the most part sat silent, save in the
Irish camp, where they jeered and
howled. A very difficult position, met
with skill and courage. Irish Mem-
bers kept up persistent interruption,
Tm Healy, in particular, spoiling
for a fight. But Chamberlain went
forward undisturbed, with aggrava-
ting habit of concluding his sen-

Colonel H-gh-s H-U-tt.

tences, broken in upon by deeply-roused Tim. Though unmoved by
opposition and interruption, Chamberlain spoke with more than
usual animation. Hotly repudiated
the charge of being animated by per-
sonal ambition.
Sexton followed, and Members,
recalling many wind-bag
performances.beganto move
away. Those that stayed
had th e better of it. It was
a speech of prodigious length
—over two hours—but full
of flashing points of alter-
nate humour and pathos.
If it had been half as long,
it would have been ten times
as effective. "A clever
fellow, Sexton," said Mac-
farlane, listening from his
seat below the Gangway.
"But he has one fatal fault
—he doesn't know when to
sit down."
Business done.—More Debate

cussing for some hours Registration of
Voters (Ireland) Bill. Motion for ad-
journment made in crowded House.
1). II. M-cf-rl-ne. When tellers came back it was evident
something'had happened. Saunderson, one of the tellers for the
"Noes" marched about in excited fashion. Whisper went round
that some one had been found in the "No'' lobby. Particulars
presently added. Mysterious person was carrying a black bag. Later
examination spoke of dynamite. Another attempt to blow up Houses
of Parliament. Members met and talked in excited groups. Result
of division announced and dead silence fell upon the House. All
eyes turned upon Saunderson who remained standing at attention,
on the floor of the House.
"Mr. Speaker, Sir," he said, in tones that thrilled
through the agitated audience. "There was one
gentleman in the 'No' lobby, who did not vote."
That was a roundabout way to put it, but it served
to confirm the prevailing impression.
"The Hon. and gallant gentleman," said
the Speaker, in terrible tones, "will say
who it was."
"Mr. McArtiiur," faltered the Maior.
"Let him be brought in," said, the
Speaker; whereupon the Major, calling for
volunteers, went in search of the culprit.
They found him under the Gallery. He at
once surrendered and was brought up trem-
bling. Turned out, after all, it was not so bad
as had been feared. Hon. Member had, he
confessed, been in the lavatory when the
throng of Members trooped into the division
lobby. Lobby door locked, he couldn't get
out. Not having heard the question put,
he couldn't vote. So here he stood between
Arnold Morlet and Major Saunderson,
with his hands behind his back conveying a
curious impression of his being handcuffed.
"I was in the lavatory," he Wubbered in
explanation, and,[amid roars of laughter, the
Speaker let him off.
Business done.—None.
s Thursday.—Debate on Home-Rule Bill
<it.i c- t "'.^ > ■ resumed by T. P. O'Connor. Rumours
Please, Sir, I won t do it about that T> p. j9 ?oing to 8plit> Tell all
□gain, about negotiations with Randolph and other
Conservative chiefs prior to last General Election, and afterwards.
House accordingly filled up. But presently went away disappointed.
T. P. it turns out, has a private code of honour, to which he made
frequent references. This enabled him to tell all about Colonel
Bridgeman, contesting Bolton, contributing eighteen hundred penny
postage-stamps to maintenance of Home Rule; but when he came to
Randolph, " my code of honour" interposed, and he was mum. In
vain House begged him to continue.
"No, no," said T. P. "I will not be dragged into departing one
hair's breadth from the line of personal and political honour which
I have set down for myself."
House rudely laughed. But T. P. not to he moved, even though

Randolph sarcastically besought him to make clean breast of it.
At midnight John Morley brought the debate up from the low level
to which it had for the first time sunk. But House sick and tired of
the whole business, and yearns for division.
Business done.—More talk on Home Rule.
Friday.—In House of Lords,
Markiss once more "rises to ex-
plain." In other House, John
Morlet has beenallud-
ing to his famous pan-
acea for Ireland—the
emigration of a mil-
lion Irishmen, and
twenty years' coercion
for those left behind.
Markiss explains that
he didn't mean that.
Kimberley manages,
in course of a few sen-
tences, to intimate his
opinion that the Mar-
kiss is endeavouring to
wriggle out of an awk-
ward situation. Every
noble back on either
side is curved,
and every head
of hair bristles,
whilst Liberals
and Conserva-
tives regard each
other like two
rows of cats on
the war - path.
Whilst Kimber- A.1 IU-ngw-rth.
ley was speaking, Ellenborough ventured upon an audible snigger.
"The noble Lord laughs," said Kimberley, fiercely.
"You're another," said Ellenborough (or, to quote the Parlia-
mentary form of this retort, Lord Ellenborough said, "As the
noble Earl very frequently does"). "Order, order!" cried a mild
Peer on a back seat, meaning to reprove Ellenborough. "I »n
perfectly in order," Kimberley said, turning upon him with savage
glare. And all this because the Markiss had risen to explain!
In Commons, Illingworth sat through questions, waiting for
opportunity to resume debate on Home-Rule Bill. Rose at
Five o'clock, and thereafter, till nearly One o'Clock in the morning,
the talk went forward; and this was the Business done.

remark afore, but I gives myself the benefit of the dowt, and goes on,—and not
only strange times, but dangerous times, because we are a hinterfering with old
customs and old hinstitutions. We have just had one serious instance of it,
and we are thretened with another. In this one instance, it is trew, the
greevous error was maid by a yuthful and comparaytifly hignerant hinstitu-
shun, and so there may be sum egscuse to be made for 'em. But the other,
conserning witch the roomer is spreading, has no Bitch egscuse, on the contrary,
it is, in these himportent matters, the hobserved' of all hobservers, the mold of
fashun and the glass of form, as Shakspear says, and it amost draws tears from
my hold heyes, wen I only thinks of wot they is sed to contemplate. Praps 'it may
be as well before I goes no furder to explane what it is as I has in my eye.
Well then it's this.
The Metropollyten Bored of Works having got to hopen a now Bridge down
at Putney, witch they has bin ever so many years a bilding on, naterally
asked the good and Poplar Prince of Whales, for to cum and hopen it for 'em,
and to ask his bootiful Princess for to cum with him, so as to make sure of one
brite sunbeam to light all the place up. And with that remarkabel kindness as
so extinguishes 'em both, they both sed as how they'd cum. So far so good.
And there was lots of flags, and lots of Tents, and lots of flowers, and Bands,
and gards of honner, and setterer, and the usual speeches. So far so good. And
then there was a hawful paws, and ewerybody looked at hewerybody else, and
ewerybody else looked preBhus cold and hungry, for there was a bitter North-
Easter a blowing, and then the hawful shock bust upon 'em all, that there wasn't
not no wittels. no not ewen a glass of wine to drink good elth to the new Bridge!
And so the Prince and Princess got into their carridge and drove away. And
all the rest of the Cumpany did the same, all looking werry cold, and werry
hungry, and werry disappintt d.
And this the pore Metropolitan Bored of Works thinks is about the rite way
for to hopen a new Bridge, poor fellers. But as they 're ony about thirty years
old, there's of coarse ewery hegscuse for 'em, but they '11 know better wen they
gets a little older, if they lives as long. Well, if that was all, I don't think as
how I shood ha' cared to ha' trubbled myself about it.
But if that was a bad beginning, wuss, much wuss. remains behind. To be
sure it 'a ony a Roomer at present, but, as we all nose, Roomers as ain't contra-
dickted grows and grows 'till they becums Fax. But to my tail. The grand
old Copperashun, not to be outdone by any Bored of Works, old or yung, is
about for to make a Bridge of their own at tho Tower, and they too has
arsked the good Prince and the bootiful Princess to cum and lay the fust stone
of it. So far so good. They fust thought of asking 'em to drive the fust pile,
but won of the werry sharpest of the Thames Conserwatifs told 'em as they mite
jest as well, when a bilding of a Church, ask the Prince to drive the fust pole
of the scaffolding, as the piles woud all be pulled up agane, so they haltered
their hinwitashun accordingly.
But having follered the iead of the Bored of Works were they was quite rite,
they are said to be agoing to foller their lead wen they was all as rong as rong
coud be, and the Prince and the Princess, and the Lord Mare and the Sheryffs,
and all the Courts of Haldermen and Common Councilmen, and all the Colo-
nysts and the Indiens, and all the other thowsends of Gests is to be sent away
without either wittles or drink! I wood, with all due respec, wenture to
surgest that anythink more hopposed to the trew interests of that nobel Hinsti-
tushun, it's hutterly himpossible to conceeve. Wot has always shut the mouths
of their loudest and hungryest henemies? Horspitality. And wot is the one
speshal hobject as their many Gests, male and female, gladly acceps their
inwitation for? Horspitality.
No! my nobel Paytrons. this won't do, not at no price! Erbolish if you will

same hawful paws ensues as at the late Putney failure, and for the fust time in

There will be assembled on that werry himportent, and should be festive

Hot Favourites for the Cup. The Off Day.
A New Cry.—After the Government defeat, there was
a lull in political excitement for a couple of days. The
newspaper sellers in the streets found some difficulty in
getting off their latest editions. Parliament wasn't
sitting, so there was no "Scene in the House," to be
shouted out, and the journal-mongers' ingenuity in in-
venting cries, was well nigh exhausted, when one of
them, with the largest stock of papers on hand, was
struck by a brilliant idea, and stumped shritking out in
his thorough gin-and-foggiest tones, " Great Panic in the
City. . . . Mr. Gladstone crushed by a Steam-roller! "—
off went his stock of papers at a penny a piece, or no
change given—and off went the hoy as fast as his legs
could carry him.
The Angel (of Islington) 's Whisper.—The Military
show is on again this week at the Agricultural Hall, it
13 always one of the best and most popular sights of the
season. Captain Dajtn, the Hoarse Soldier on foot, is the
centre of attraction in the arena. Crowds will go from
Belgravia, and Bnyswater, to Dann. Major Tully, lineal
descendant of Tully Maximus, known as Kieebo, is in
command. There is plenty given for the money, as the
Programme is uncommonly full. Major Tully has bravely
tried to out it down—but this is a feat which defies even
his skill—and he has been beaten utterly—or ut-tully.

Then
The three statesmen stood facing one another in silence,
the Irish Vioeroy spoke.
"You must decide quickly," he said, addressing the noble Marquis,
"for I am expecting him every moment. What is it to be? Am 1
to offer terms, or am I not?"
"Can't we near what he has to propose?" replied the little Secre-
tary of State for India, parrying the question. "Look here, it
won't do for us, you know, to appear interested in the matter. I '11
get under the table," and suiting the action to the word, he stooped
down and crept beneath the official cloth.
The idea was instantly seized upon by the Marquis.
"Capital!" he rejoined, "Hide me somewhere too. Ha! the
cupboard!" and, in another instant the noble speaker was en-
deavouring to double himself up, not without some difficulty, amid
bundles of quill pens and reams of blotting paper. At that moment
an approaching footfall was heard in the corridor. He rapidly
pulled the cupboard door to, and had scarcely ooncealed himself be-
fore the Stranger entered. He carried a small carpet bag in his hand
which he placed upon the table. The Viceroy courteously motioned
him to a seat.
"You.have had my letter?" asked the Stranger, taking his place
with a formal bow, and, I conclude, have digested its contents?"
The other answered by a slight acknowledgment. "Well," he con-
tinued, eyeing him suspiciously, "what is it to be? Are you pre-
pared to go as far as complete legislative independence, control over
taxation, police maintenance and virtual separation. You see I have
brought the flag for your approval." He opened the carpet bag as
he spoke, and took from it a large green silk pocket handkerchief
emblazoned with a yellow harp. How do you like it ?" he asked,
at the same time holding it out and displaying it on the back of the
office chair.
A puzzled expression was on the Viceroy's faoe. The other noticed
it f' You hesitate P" he said.
"No—no, not precisely," was the cautious reply. "But the faot
is von take me a little unawares. It is very pretty, certainly; but
I don't know that I am quite empowered by my colleagues to express
any definite opinion upon the matter. Personally, of course, I should
have no objection to the harmless emblem. But I can't say whether
the Marquis, for instance"—he looked nervously towards the cup-
board. A slight cough of approval encouraged him to continue, and
he went on— I can't say whether he would fully indorse the entire
programme. Still, I am inclined to think that, if I submitted it to
him, he might be disposed to entertain it." There was a suppressed
chuckle from under the table. The Stranger turned pale, and rose
to his feet.
"You are laughing at me!" he cried, somewhat angrily.
"Indeed, no! rejoined the other, much embarrassed. "I think
it must have been the wind." He walked round the table, and
placed himself in front of it.
"Well, laughing or no laughing, that's what I 've got to propose."
replied his interlocutor, at the same time refolding the green silk
pocket-handkerchief, and replaoing it carefully in the carpet-bag.
And you may like it, or leave it. If it is understood that you'll
take this platform, well, then, the vote shall go for you solidly at the
Elections. But, on the other hand, if not"
He would have oontinued, bat at that moment the Marquis burst
from the cupboard. He was still hot with the confinement, but a
tine smile played upon his features. The Stranger started back sur-
prised. The Marquis felt some explanation of his appearance was
due under the circumstances. And he gave it. "I did not wish,"
he said, "to be officially cognisant of this little interview, and so I
hid in the cupboard on your arrival. But I have heard what you
propose, and, as I consider the flag very pretty, I think I may say—
I am agreeable."
"And so am I," continued the little Indian Seoretary, still chuck-
ling, and getting out from under the table. "Only, mum's the
word. Of course, if it ever comes out, we know nothing about
thisP"
"Just so," endorsed the Marquis, hastily; "for we are,obviously
not aware, officially, of any proposition not directly addressed to us.
"Certainly," oontinued the Vioeroy; "and I may say with regard
to this that has gone on outside the Cabinet, that I have had no
communication on the subject, or authorisation, and that 1 have not
communicated with them on that which I have done; and therefore
the responsibility has been simply and solely mine."

SADLY THE TROUBADOUR."
New Opera. Words by Dr. Hueffer. Musk by Mr. Mackenzie.
Highly soientific no doubt is the musio of The Troubadour by-
Mr. Mackenzie, but I shall leave the Expert "Nibbelusglet" to
leal with it.
What is the dainty subject selected for Operatic treatment by the

• There is a very much ill-used
v. husband Raimon, who does not
1 appear to have been guilty of any
- impropriety, but whose stupidity
"is almost criminal, and whose
subsequent conduct, when his
suspicions of his wife are con-
firmed, is decidedly so. His wife
, Margarida, is an hysterical
effusive fool; her sister Azalais,
a shameless go-between, and even
worse: and Guillem de Cabestan
—so like Cabstand—is, as a pro-

a man, he is an unprincipled,
sneaking villain, who nowadays
would probably be out by such
respeotable Troubadours as
"Squash" the "Bohee Brothers,"
or any gentleman who earns an
honest livelihood by attending
race-meetings with a banjo.
This sneaking professional Guillem makes love to Margarida, the
wife of Raimon: and she returns it. Azalais, her sister, betrothed to
& Count Robert, does her bestto prevent Raimon from discovering the
truth, and pretends that it is she herself who is the object of
Guillem's passion. So Raimon is apparently perfectly content that
his future brother-in-law should be deceived; but as he doesn't quite
believe the story, he uses Count Robert as his tool—(" Raimon and
Robert were two pretty men")—
and gets up a fight between him
and Guillem, in which the latter
will probably be killed, unless
Margarida should rush in between
the combatants, and thus betray
her secret. This alternative hap-
pens, and then, after taking no pains
to prevent his wife and her para-

and in Margarida's chamber, where,
at the opening of Aot IV., they

is great as a dramatist, especially in writing his stage-directions.
Judging from these, I should imagine that he has had some hand in
the mise-en-scene, as, for the first time in my experience of Drury
Lane under the present management, 1 failed to recognise the stage-
craft of Augustus Druriolanus. Almost all Dr. Hueffer's stage-
directions are worth quoting as models for future librettists who
would be their own stage-managers. Here are a few gems, taken at
hap-hazard:—" Signs of admiration amongst the crowd." "Shouts
and rustic music behind." "They perform a graceful dance sym-
bolic of the vintage." And the Act ends with "Chorus, promis-
cuously," which is a real flash of genius.
In the Second Act the unprincipled professional Guillem is seen

Raimon's wife, by reading to her an erotic poem, to whioh no decent
woman under the circumstances could have listened for a moment
without boxing the dissolute scoundrel's ears. But instead of this
honest and energetic action being given in the stage-directions, we
only find—'' He pauses; they look in each other's eyes: the book
drops on the ground unheeded. Long silence." There are two or
three "long silences" in the book, but who goes to the Opera to
hear " a long silence " f
Here is a good dramatic stage-direction, whioh exhibits Dr.
HuErFEB, as a master of construction. All the characters have just
gone off, including Margarida. But a solo for Margarida is required,
i this is how the dramatist artfully contrives it:—"Exeunt, t}c, Sfc.
Margarida accompanies them for a short distance." Aa far as the
Green-room door P "The stage remains empty for
a fete moments. Re-enter Margarida hurriedly."
Isn't this a triumph of ingenious stage-manage-
ment P Then Dr. Hueffer's sportsmen sing,—
'"A nut-brown doe we carry here.
Fair was the fight,
But at last we beat her."
What brave sportsmen! And the last stage-
direction in the Act is—" Curtain drops slowly
on a dark and empty stage." How Wagnerian!
But, with much of this sort of thing, it wouldn't
be only the stage that would be "dark and
empty."
Act III. commences with " Night,"—the greater
part of the Opera is played in tne dark—and the
tinest gems of Huefferian stage-directions are in
this Act. Guillem the unprincipled and rather
fat troubadour, and Margarida, the hysterical

a time "—Dramatist Hdeffer is very fond of pauses and intervals,
and likes to give his lovers every opportunity,— Count Robert in
lively conversation with several cavaliers, comes from the castle to the
front of the stage." And then in an agony lest the actor should be
too lively in his conversation,—a fault with which it is impossible to
charge the librettist,—Dr. Hueffer in a foot-note explains, " The
actor is supposed to indicate delicately that Robert, though not drunk,
is excited by wine." Dr. Hueffer evidently had not much confidence
either in the intelligence or the dramatio capability of Mr. Barring-
tott Foote who played the part of Robert—not a bit like our Robert,
the City Waiter, whom we should much like to see in Italian Opera.
At the end of thiB Act he gives peremptory directions for " Very
quick curtain," and so exactly were his orders obeyed, that the rapidity
of the curtain's descent abruptly interfered with Madame Val-
leria's singing, and 'startled the audience, who thought some
accident had happened. I did not wait for the Troubadour with his
bier in the last Act, but made "aquick curtain" of it, leaving
the composer to be publicly congratulated on his cleverness, and
Troubadour Hueffer to be crowned by his friends and admirera.

"Nlbbblunqlet" says :—
The Troubadour, written by Dr. Hueffer,
and composed by Mr. Mackenzie, is a melan-
eholy work. The story is dismal, and so is
the music. Hardly one ray of sunshine pene-
trates the murky gloom which overshadows
the entire Opera. After the festivities in the
First Act-there is positively nothing but
misery in the melodies, which has a naturally
depressing effect upon the audience. Mr.
Barton McGuckin sang the Troubadour's
arduous and, in some places, actually tire-
tome, musio with the most praiseworthy per-
sistency and some obvious effort. His song
with "lute" accompaniment was one of the
btst numbers in the Opera. The prelude to
the Third Act is also worthy of espeoial
mention, being a sonorous and refreshingly
straightforward entr'acte. Mr. McGuckin
has some fairly effective love-music with
Margarida; Madame Valleria sang this
part to perfection. Mr. Leslie Grotty as
the "wicked Count" was admirable from a
musical point of view, and Bang with thrill-
ing effect a drinking song, which Dr. Huef-
"« calls a "posy, in the last Act. This
is highly ingenious, recalling by its
and instrumental acoompan:
ment, the well-known "serenade " sung by
Mephistovheles beneath the window of another

is an enormous amount of musicianly work in
the new Opera, but little inspiration.
The masterly employment of contrasted
rhythms in alternation and combination, the
tine orchestral colour, and above all, the
splendid part-writing of the choruses, inspire
the profoundest respect for the composer's
attainments, but give little of the satisfac-
tion to an ordinary audience, that a success-
ful Opera should do. The method of Wag-
ner, is not one to be lightly handled. No one
yet has written an Opera in the least like
him, though many have essayed to follow in
his steps. The sensation of fatigue induced
upon listeners' minds by the interminable un-
reeling of recitative, accompanied by snatches
of hit motives and restless instrumentation, is
not successfully combated by the reflection
that it is "very clever." Mr. Mackenzie
can certainly claim a lenient judgment on
the ground that he was heavily handicapped
by his collaborateur. Who could write music
to such words as :.these: "Be welcome, fair
ladies both, to this our meeting"—just as if
the Bcene were laid at Exeter Hall.
Mr. Mackenzie's strong point is the or-
chestra, which he thoroughly understands.

Ride on, great Chief! A mournful ride!
The ebbing and the flowing tide
Of battle now
Sets—for awhile—against you. Doom
Dulls in your eye its light; its gloom
Shadows your brow.

Tell that defeat is hard to brook,
And heavier thus,
Because old comrades many, brave,
Swell the foes' ranks whose standards wave
Yictorious.
Where are the men who many a day
Have fought around you in the fray,
Defying fear?
Ask where the fire of youth now glows,
Where are dead summers, where the snows
Of yester year?
Argyll is gone, his cocky crest,
Like Chanticleer's, which ever prest
Straight to the van,
I the foe ne late assailed;
sgton, who never failed
To play the man:
Gone Chamberlain, gone Goschen, gone—
Of shocks the sorest!—Glorious John.
And these have turned

And lowered the flag where Victory's flame
So oft hath burned.

"Easy all!" cried a merry young voice to the crew,
"We must hear the old echo of Maidenhead Bridge."
Ha! ha! ha! ha I a dozen times
It gives them back their fun and rhymes.
From coxswain to crew, from maiden to Midge,
A laugh was the echo of Maidenhead Bridge!
In a shower that gloomily swept through the arch,
A rower in silence moved down with the stream,
There were tears on the willow and sighs from the larch,
And the bells of the flowers were closed in a dream.
His thoughts travelled back to the merry young crew,
As it floated one summer, long past in the " Midge,"
When men seemed so faithful, and women so true,
So he tried the old echo of Maidenhead Bridge.
Alas! Alas! a dozen times.
It gave him back his mournful rhymes.
From flower to field: from river to ridge,
A sigh was the echo of Maidenhead Bridge!
On a morning that carolled the birth of the Spring,
A rower went up from the village of Bray
And he heard in the distance a pretty voice sing
From a boat that was steering the opposite way.
He had longed to remember, and she to forget,
How their eyes met in love in the merry old Midge,
Together they stopped but a minute—and yet
They tried the old eoho of Maidenhead Bridge.
A kiss! a kiss! old loves, and rhymes,
It brought them back forgotten times.
From Winter to Spring; from river to ridge,
A kiss was the echo of Maidenhead Bridge!

DIARY OF AN ANTI-ALCOHOLIC ISLANDER.
Monday.—Capital idea of Lord Wolseley to send us to this
hitherto uninhabited place, where drink is unattainable, and where,
consequently, I cannot indulge in my pernicious but still very
pleasant failing of taking too many stimulants. Arrived last night,
and had to sleep in a hollow tree. Sorry to disturb something which
glided away in the darkness. Never like to be rude. However,
consoled this morning on learning I had only started a cobra.
Tuesday.—Not half a bad place, but very primitive. The other
colonists, it seems, have gone away in the night. Well, let them;
they were sad drunkards. Am very dry. Can't get anything here.
Perh aps the departed colonists may have left some liquor, although
it is scarcely likely. Have examined their effects, and can only find
Somebody on Domestic Management. This should be useful. Island
wonderfully productive. Lots of bullocks, sheep, and horses, also
poultry. Have taken up residence in log-hut left by colonists.
Wednesday.—Woke up in the middle of the night by the whole of
my live stock coming up-stairs into my bedroom. It appears that
with much animal instinct they had taken refuge there to escape the
wolves, who are very ravenous. Got rid of them by tlirowing my
boots and other missiles at them. In the morning consulted my
Domestic Management, to see how I could get a rump-steak. Had
some difficulty in killing a bullock ; and although I got what I wanted,
fear I must have wasted a good deal of meat in the operation.
Thursday.—Wolves quiet, because they were feeding all night on
the remains of the bullock, which I had to kill yesterday to get my
rump-steak. In the morning consulted my Domestic Management,
but could find nothing directly bearing upon "How to clear a prairie
or primeval forest for cultivation," which was the question I wanted
answered. Cut down a bit of a tree in four hours. Considered that
at that rate it would take me months to clear the place, so hit upon
the idea of setting the whole thing on fire. It was a magnificent
sight. The woods blazed away splendidly. The only disadvantage
was that, it started all the wild beasts, who made for my hut as a
sort of trysting-place. However they were frightened away by some
yelling savages, who it appears are the native inhabitants of the
place. After disposing of the lions, tigers, cobras and wild elephants,

the Home-Rule Bill be known in future as the "Great
Divide"?
they wanted to kill me. Pacified their chief by presenting him with
some glass beads and a showy doll from the Lowther Arcade.
Friday.—Native savages not half bad fellows when you know
them. They are rather fond of torturing one another—but that ia
not their fault, but the error of their early education. Most of them
had breakfast with me. They didn't seem to care, however, about tea
or coffee. They asked for Bosh." After much discussion, I dis-
covered that this was an ardent spirit, made by the natives. Very
shocked, and spent the remainder of the day in warning them not to
take it. I tasted some myself .and must confess it was excellent.
Saturday.—Been drinking Bosh all night. Saw ship coming; to
pick me up. No, six ships—at least I think so. Tell natives
mustn't take Bosh—bad for ' em. Am teetotaller myself, but Bosh
seems to agree with me. Like this Island—keeps me out 0' mischief.
Can't get drink here. But don't count Bosh. Am being carried
to ship. Am very bad in boat. Remonstrate, and they tell me I
am drunk. Want to fight 'em all. Very tired. Shall turn into my
berth in my boots. Want to go back to the Desert Island. Bosh!
A DISTINCT DENIAL.
Iir the "article last week entitled "Comparing Notes," Nrs-
belunqlet described how our "dear old Charles Halle" got
a "warm reception," and how "Madame Norman Nebuda was
present to do honour to her newly-married lord." From which it
was very naturally inferred that Madame Neruda had recently
changed her name to Halle.
We are authorised to say that there is no sort of foundation for this
report, which, we believe, first appeared in some German paper. It
was a case of writ in error," as Nibbehtnqlet was evidently labour-
ing under an Halle-cination, and might as well have said that the
eminent composer and pianist was wedded to a " Halle-lujah lass."
We sincerely regret that anything in these pages should have
caused annoyance to a distinguished lady and gentleman who at
various times have given Mr. Punch such real pleasure; and on his
behalf, and speaking for the too-confiding but now distracted Nib-
belcnglet, we take the first opportunity of contradicting this state-
ment, editori-Halle.

THE CENTRAL LOBBY, HOUSE OF COMMONS. Tuesday Morning, June 8th, 1886.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June 7.—" This is our closing day,"
Harcourt hummed, as he made his way to his seat, through the
crowd at the Bar. Before the House rises, fate of Home-Rule Bill
and of the Government will be settled. In anticipation, greatest
crowd since Alderman and Baronet Fowler presided in chair set on
floor of House. Every seat on floor taken. Members fill up the
Gangways, crowd the Bar, and cluster round the Speaker's chair.
All the Galleries overflowed. The outside lobbies crowded and a
multitude at the gates of Palace Yard.
Goscmnr, loudly cheered by Conservatives; resumed debate.
Unusually animated, gesticulated fiercely, to imminent danger of
Hartxsgton's hat.
After this silvery tones of Parnell, filled the House in strange
contrast with the uplifted voice of Goschen. Parnell on his very
best behaviour. Bland to the furthest degree. Even when he dis-
closed the terms of the bargain made by the late Conservative
Government for Irish vote, he did not raise his voice half a note,
whilst passion seethed around him, and the House was filled with
cries of astonishment, derision and contradiction.
Whilst it was yet the dinner-hour, Joseph Cowen delivered an
oration full of fire and colour, listened to with admiration by a House
again rapidly filling. After him, once more the contrast of level
voice and unimpassioned manner. Sir Michael Hicks-Beach was
on bis feet. Members straining their necks, to catch what he would
say in reply to Parnell's disclosure. Didn't say anything for half
an hour. Then " to the best of my knowledge and belief," declared
amid mocking laughter, that " if any such statement was communi-
cated by anyone to Mr. Parnell, he had not the authority of the
Cabinet."
Gladstone appeared at the table at twenty minutes past Eleven.
Pale and stern-looking in visage, with a white flower in his button-
hole, and the pomatum pot extracted with difficulty from his coat-
tail pocket. For an hour and forty minutes he talked; full of vigour
and animation, flashing back retorts upon his constant interrupters
and winding up with a lengthened, and sustained peroration, in
which he pictured Ireland standing at the Bar expectant, hopeful,
almost suppliant.
Tuesday, l'lO a.m.—Gladstone just sat down amid vociferous
cheering. In slow voice Speaker put the question that the Bill be
read a Second Time. A roar of " Aye!" was followed by a shout of
"No!" Hard to say which sound preponderated. Then, with
sudden rustling movement, Members on either side rose, and stepping
down the Gangway, mingled on the floor of the House, some passing
towards the doorway under the Clock, others making for the exit
behind the Speaker s Chair. The House cleared, the doors were
locked, and for a moment the place so lately a scene of bustle, was
deserted. Then the doors were unlocked, and Members trooped in
in level stream from either side, rapidly filling up the benches. A
quarter of an hour passed, and still Members streamed in. Glad-
stone picking his way through the throng, was recognised and loudly
cheered. At twenty-five minutes past One, Marjoribanks and
Brand, who had been telling for the supporters of the Bill, were seen
fighting their way through the crowd, and making for the table.
All eyes were turned to the other entrance, but there was no sign of
Arnold Morlet and Caxni, telling for the Opposition. This told a
story without uttered speech. The first in had the fewest to " tell."

from the corner hench below the Gangway, and Joseph Gillis,
Tim Healy, and the rest took the time from him. Now Ran-
dolph sat on Front Bench above the Gangway, excitedly twirling
his moustache, hut successfully resisting the impulse to put on
Grand Cross's spectacles, and throw Hicks-Beach s hat in the air.
Joseph Gillis sat below the Gangway, sardonically grinning, and
occasionally ejaculating a scornful Ha! ha!" and a contemptuous
"Ob! oh!" Tim Healt answered Conservative jubilation with
ardent groans.
Cheers renewed again and again by Conservatives when figures
announced, showing majority of 30 against Bill. Parnellites could
retain their seats
no longer. They
all leapt to their
feet, some on to
the benches, as of
yore, and defiantly
answered the
oheering of the victors.
A moment of terrible
passion. A little more,

would be at each other's
throats. But it passed off
in sound of fury, and with
a ringing cheer for the
Grand Old Man, and
groans for Chamberlain,
led by Redmond, Junior,
the excited mob dispersed.
Business done.—Home-
Rule Bill thrown out by
341 votes against 311.
Thursday.—Shadow of
dissolution hanging low
over the House. In-
fluence felt in various
directions. Members
elected for the first time
seven months ago, inclined to make hay whilst the sun shines—
or rather speeches, whilst Parliament sits. John Morley, questioned
about Ulster Riots, gives full account of arrangements for main-
tenance of order. "Constabulary," he says, "were all posted at
Half-past Five o'Clock last night.
"Well," said Lord John Manners, who is looking forward to re-
instatement at St. Martin's-le-Grand, "that was excellent time for
first delivery in the morning." Major Saunderson wanted to know
whether the man shot at Lurgan was not a Protestant. A shrewd
movement this—designed to show up the Nationalists as the
aggressors. But Tim Healy equal to the occasion, "Before the
question is answered," he said, "perhaps the Right Hon. Gentleman
will say whether the two men shot at Monaghan were not set upon
by tho Orange Party."

Brutus Roscius Kean R-dm-nd, Jun.
"Yah! Yah!"
So, on'the balance, the.Nationalists scored one, and the Parnellites
madly cheered.
Gladstone announces inevitable dissolution, and the House gets
to work in Committee of Supply, in preparation for bringing it
about. Business done.—Dissolution announced.
Friday Night.—House of Lords adjourned for what is humorously
called the Wnitsun Recess. Commons hard at work on Army Esti-
mates, but Parliament practically broken up. The empty benches
to-night stand in melancholy contrast with the animated appearance
of the last three weeks. Still a few Members left to make long
speeches, worrying at the votes, just as if all other matters were
following habitual course. Lobby the busiest part of House.
Thronged with ex-Members willing once more to place their services
at the disposal of the country. Among them comes Wabton with
hospitable snuff-box. But much has nappened since he was here
last. The new Members pass him by without recognition, and pre-

Business done.—Army Estimates in Supply.
LYRICS IN A LIBRARY.
IV.—TO ROBERT BCRTON.
A quaint old store of learning lies
In Burton's pleasant pages;
With longquotations that comprise
The wisdom of the ages.
'Tis strange to read him 'mid the
crowd,
And modern hurly-burly;
The only author Johnson vowed
Could make him get up early.
He lived a solitary life,
He said " Mihi et musis"
And put hisrestfrom worldly strife
To very pleasant uses,
lie wrote the book wherein we find,
"All joys to this are folly ;"
Andnaught, to the reflective mind,
"So sweet as melancholy."
How strangely he dissects his
theme
In manner anatomic;
He's earnest at one time you deem,
Now decorously comic.
And most prodigiously he quotes,
With learning quite gigantic,
Or telling classic anecdotes,
Is pleasantly pedantic.
There's sterling sense in every
An
J shrewdest cogitation.
Your keen attention he '11 engage,
And honest admiration.
If any man should vow to live
With but one book, be certain
To him could friendly fortune give
No better book than Burton.
He lies at rest in Christchurch
aisle,
With all his erudition;
The hieroglyphics make one smile
That show nis superstition.
His epitaph survives to-day,
As one Cut ritam dedit
El mortem Melancholia"
So he himself has said it.

A MIDSUMMER MID-DAY REALITY.
Whatever the Crystal Palace is, it certainly is not "No Manns
Land," for Mr. Manns with his band reign supreme. "The Mid-
summer Night's Dream," with Mr. Manns' excellent band, Men-
delssohn's music, Katti Lanner's children, Mr. Stedman's boys,
Mr. Fernandez's company, and Mr. Oscar Barrett's assistance,
was excellent. The musical portion of the entertainment was

absolutely faultless. Madme Katti Lanner's pupils danced as
well as ever, and insisted upon introducing their talented instructress
into Act IT. Miss Alma Murray was a picturesque Titania, and
Mr. Fernandez as Bottom, the amateur player, reminded me of
PHliLPS, but was not sufficiently idiotic. The representative of Puck
was perhaps too pantomimic, but on the whole the show could not
possibly have been better.
JACK'S DOG; OK, THE MAN WHO SHOT IT!
Take Le Testament de Casar Girardot as a sound foundation;
scatter over scraps from Atjoier and Sandeau; add the whole
of the will scene, word for word, sentiment for sentiment, and
business for business, from Buxwer Lttton's Honey; jerk in
scraps from Good for Nothing, two Bohemians quarrelling over
a good-hearted girl; garnish with scenes from immortal dog
dramas, and there you have the new and original four-act comedy,
Jack. There are some pretty bits in it, but they are all borrowedi;
there are some strong scenes, but they are all plagiarised. The only
satisfaction to be derived from Jack is the definite discovery of the
man who really did shoot the dog. We have got him at last. He is
not Jack, but Jack's friend, a vulgar, low-minded reprobate, who
pretends to be a Bohemian, and acts with incomprehensible ingratitude
that would disgrace a savage. Jack and his friend live together. They
rescue Nan, and both love her. Jack's friend wins Nan, and Jack
wipes away a manly tear. The successful suitor comes unexpectedly
into a fortune, whereupon he insults Nan, cuts his Bohemian pals,
and shoots Jack's dog. Jack, disgusted, sneaks back to his attic,
and finds Nan awaiting him. They foregather, and naturally dis-
cover that Jack is the real heir, and not Jack's friend.
The dog is dead—but no matter, for the play is ended. It is inte-
resting chiefly from the fact that Miss Dorothy Dene has had
another chance, and availed herself of it. Nan, in Goodfor Nothing,
is not her line at all. Sho is not a simple, quaint, sympathetic
actress, fortified with tricks of art that only experience can give. She
has heart, she has voice, she has power, as we saw the other day at the
| Greek plays. A girl who can play Cassandra should not waste her
time on a diluted Nan, or give her fresh, young energy to a pro-
gramme that begins with plagiarism, and ends with fustian. It can
do a clever yonng lady like Miss Dorothy but little good to be seen
in Dean Street, when such an appropriated original play as Jack is
followed by one more tedious imitation of Hrnry Irvino, and still
another empty echo of Mowbray Morris's played-out joke of the
critics, the chicken, and the champagne! A young actor, or actress,
does a distinctly unwise thing when lending influence to any
entertainment initiated on frivolity, and based on bad taste. The
acting of both Eben Plymtton and Dorothy Dene is too good to be
wasted on dog comedies and doggerel burlesques. Mr. Henley
was onoe strong at the Gaiety in a very brief Irvingesque imitation,
but is now, in view perhaps of Regatta time, Henley Weak.

THE TWO OPERAS.
In "The Garden."—Rigoletto showed us what Mile.
Ella Russell could do, and how high Bhe could go when
Gilda disappears into the attic storey—a most dram-attic
storey, in view of what takes place there—in the second
scene of Act I. Signor D'Andrade played the Fool
within measurable distance of perfection; and he can sing
too, which is much in this part, the thoroughly satisfac-
tory combination of acting and singing being rare.
Signor Mabjni was 72 Duca—a very ill Duca—yet
he had an exceptional triumph over all other Dukes that
I've ever heard, and that was, that his La Donna i
Mobile fell hopelessly flat. For the rest, it was a good
performance; and as to the mise en scene, I was able,
with deep emotion, to exclaim, "Scenes of my child-
hood! once more I behold ye!" Can Signor Lago
inform me whether the terms of tho leases held by
Rigoletto and his neighbour Conte de Caprano compel
them to paint their nouses within and without every
seven years? If so, neither of them has done it.
Un Ballo in Maschera is to be performed again. It
deserved the encore, and ought to draw a very big house.
On Saturday La Traviata was given. Albani's acting
as Violetta, especially in the Second Act, was very fine.
As to her singing, cela va sans dire,—though, by the way,
if it did, the result would have been songs without words.
In "The Lane." — The Expert, '7 Nibelunglet,"
says:—" The revival, last week, of Mr. Goring Thomas's
first operatic success, Esmeralda, was very welcome.
Miss Geobgina Burns played the heroine, and. Mr. Leslie
Cbottt acted the pathetic part of Quasimodo as hereto-
fore. His singing in the last Act previous to his being
made 'King of the Fools,' by the merry beggars, was
touching in the extreme. Mr. Barton McGuckin as the
military hero, Phoebus, and Mr. James Sauvaqe as the
evilly disposed monk Frollo, were both more than satis-
factory, while the music of the opera is fascinating from
beginning to end. The critics say it is'very French.' By
that they presumably mean that it is a contrast to the
Anglo—not to say Double—Dutch strains of Colombo
and The Troubadour." I may add that, from a dramatic
point of view, Mr. McGuckin shone as Phabus, an extra-
ordinary instance of Phoebus shining at night; and that
Mr. Sauvage]s Claude Frollo is one of the best things he
has done, which, perhaps, is not saying very much.
Seeing the patronage bestowed on musical performances
everywhere, and the discrimination shown by the mixed
audiences, it is a puzzle to me how it seems to be taken as
settled, that an Opera Company Limited, with an English
and Italian season, would not pay a dividend, and that
the shares would soon be going for a mere song P The

A GREAT BOON.
"The Lord's Day" in London has come to be exclusively "The Day
of the Lords;" that is, of the Upper Classes, who have only to spend their
money and command their amusement. But for the Artisan, for the respectable
Working-Man and his family, it is indeed a day of rest from labour, but it is
a rest without recreation, wearying rather than refreshing. The Daily
Telegraph of last Saturday proposed the opening of "The Colinderies" free of
charge on Sundays. What possible objection can there be to this? A simple
organisation will provide that this boon to the genuine Working-Man shall not
entail extra compulsory labour on a single official, nor offend a single con-
scientious scruple. Mr. Punch has not, just now, the space at command to
allow him to go into the pros and cons of the question, but he refers his readers
to the plea for the millions in the Daily Telegraph of June 19th; and to that
proposition therein contained he begs to say ditto. JjJSlNCR.
The Vicae of Bray Rediytvus.—There was a difficulty last Sunday among
the Churchmen, for it was a Double Festival. The anniversary of the Queen's
Accession fell on Trinity Sunday. Church and State Clergy were mightily
perplexed. The ^Esthetic Archbishop did his best to serve two masters, but the
Rev. E. A. Humphreys, of Cambridge, triumphed over all obstacles by com-
posing a Hymn which celebrated the dual festival in one devout and loyal verse.
This Reverend Gentleman is a real Unionist, not an Unitarian, and, when pre-
ferment is about, we hope ho will find his reward.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House ofCommons, Wednesday, June 16.—House met again to-
day, after Whitsun holidays. Remarkable improvement visible in
appearanoe of Members. Bronzed cheeks, brighter eyes, more
vigorous action. This only to be expected. Whitsun holidays have
been two days long, and, judiciously spent on land and sea, have
wrought this marvellous and happy effect. Comparatively few
Members baok. In the division, 162 voted, but something less than
the odd sixty-two kept their seats throughout debate. The rest
already entered upon electoral campaign.
A crowd of Bills on the paper, and report of Supply to be dealt
with. This last involves the trifling expenditure of Twelve Millions
sterling. But Members, fresh from holiday, not inclined to be
cantankerous.
Sage of Queen Anne's Gate moves rapidly in and out and round
about the House. The other morning, when dawn was stealing over
sleeping Metropolis, he managed to tack on to quite another Bill a
clause throwing costs of returning officers upon the rates. Bill
comes up to-day on motion for Third Reading. Conservatives muster
in all available foroe to throw it out. But the Sage is too many for
them; the Bill passes, and the Sage smiles. "Let him laugh who
wins," said John Manners. "Thank Heaven we've a House of
Lords!"
Business done.—Appropriation Bill brought in, and read First
Time.
Thursday— Here's The O'Kelly look-
ing for Chamberlain. But that's the only
sign of animation about the House. It
appears that Chamberlain 's been having
a little correspondence with The O'Kelly,
which he regards a3 concluded. The
O'Kelly takes another view of the situation.
Has a few more words to say if he can
only get at Chamberlain's ear,
which, in truth, he is prepared to
pull. In the meantime stalks
through the corridors, looking for
him in the Smoking-Room, Read-
ing-Room, and on the Terrace.
Rather encourage this enterprise.
Will in time work off superfluous
energy. Afraid if he were to sit
down now, he would spontaneously
explode.
As for the House, it reaches
lower depths of dulness. Winding
up business of Parliament; getting
ready for decent death and burial.
Some inquiry about French action
in New Hebrides. But Scotch
Members not to be drawn into the
controversy, which fades away
in question and answer. Joseph
Glllis, taking note of the near
approach of the end of all things, makes spasmodic effort to
resume his older form. Joey B., himself still clothed with the
radianoe of later youth, has a grievance against venerable age. "A
vain old gentleman," he once called Gladstone, in those far-off
days before peace reigned in the Irish quarter. Has now discovered
a muoh older gentleman, who has seen fourscore years, and still
draws a salary in the Irish Administration. How many hours a day
does he give to the office? Joey B. asks, with something of the old
gleam in his eye, and a shadow of the old smile hovering about his
lips. But it was a poor, weak effort; and having shot his dart,
Joseph slunk away, a little ashamed of himself.
The new order of things illustrated again in respect of Appropria-
tion Bill. Second Reading now moved. In good old times this the
great opportunity for Irish Members. What long days of contention
we used to have in good old times! what all-night sittings! what
Saturday afternoons! and what shock to the lamented Phil Callan
when we sat into Sunday morning! All this changed now. Not an
Irish voice uplifted in opposition to the stage. Lyon Playfaxu has it
pretty well all to himself. Delivers to scantily-attended class one
of those luminous lectures he sometimes interposes in the round
of barrenpolitical discussion. Most excellent and eloquent disqui-
sition on Education. "A wonderfully able little fellow, Playfair,"
said William Aonew, listening with rapt attention. "Always
reminds me of what Sidney Smith said of Jeffrey: 'Hasn't body
enough to cover his mind decently with. His intellect is indecently
exposed.'"
Appropriation Bill read Second Time, Members thought they might
depart. But Whips were on sentry at the door.

"And pray why
do you do that?
said Hingley, a
New Member,
anxious for in-
formation.
"I take that course,"
said Harcourt, "because
matters may so arrange themselves
that the proceedings might come to a
conclusion with an abruptness which
would prevent the formality of moving
the Adjournment."
Precaution not without justifi-
cation. A lot of Bills run
through. Law of Evidence
Amendment Bill reached. This
in charge of Henry James, who
voted against Home-Rule Bill.
Argal, Henry James must not
prosper with any measure of
his own. So Irish Members
oppose. Move Adjournment—37
for adjourning, just 10 in favour.
Happy Thought. If the 37 walk
out, and even two of the 40
fail to remain in their places,
house can be Counted Out. So
Molloy gets up and discusses
the Bill. A mysterious move-
ment takes place. Members glide
out from all the benches. A
Count is moved. A quorum not
made. House adjourns at Five

James and his Bill vanish into

L
COMPARING NOTES.
Tire grand "Wagner Operatic Concert given last week by the
Richter Orchestra at the Albert Hall was a decided success. Such
pieces as the Overture to Tannhduser, and the Walkurenritt.or
Ride of the Wo/Ayries" (sounds contradictory, though "The
Walkeries" might do for the name of anew South Kensington Exhi-
bition—say of fishing-tackle and pedestrian appliances, such as sticks,
umbrellas, alpenstocks, &c.,—and call it "The Hookey Walkeries "),
have already Deoome old favourites. The Musical "Ride" would cer-
tainly have been ridden over again if Herr Richter had consulted
the expressed wishes of the audience instead of his watch. The
"Prize Song" from The Mastersingers would almost as surely have
been encored had it been song; but Mr. Edward Lloyd was
attacked by what Mr. Hermann Franke termed a "sudden cold"
(a cold in a Ned is a troublesome thing), and both this number and the
prayer from Act V. of Rienzi were cut out bodily. Madame Vallebia
sang the Ballad from Act II. of The Flying Dutchman. It is a sea-
song, introducing the German equivalent of the familiar " Yeo-ho."
Mr. Geobg Henschel (why Mr. f But I suppose that's neither
Herr nor there) gave a fine rendering of Wotaivs farewell song to
Briinhilde, whom he leaves to sleep surrounded by flames. The
Funeral March at Siegfried11 death was splendidly and impressively
played by the band, as was also the exciting and enthusiastic closing
scene of Tristan und Isolde.
Nadeshda, Mr. Goring Thomas's beautiful Opera, which was
produced last year by Carl Rosa, was revived on Thursday last
before a crowded and enthusiastic audience. There is a good deal of
inherent improbability in the story, but the main plot is a romantic
and interesting one, while the music is simply magnificent. The
Second Act, which introduces a merry-making of peasants in the
hall of Voldemar, is one continuous flow of gracious and exquisitely
fanciful melody, Nadeshda's song, " As when the Snowdrift" with its
chorus by the assistants," being as good as anything in the Opera.
Mr. Barton McGucktn (Voldemar) m thoroughly grateful music
surpassed himself, as did Madame Geobgina Burns in the title rule.
Mr. Leslie Cbotty, as the wicked brother, Ivan, was realistic in his
acting besides forcible in his declamation. The Contralto, Miss
Dickebson {Princess Natalie) was the least deserving of praise; her
voice was not agreeable, and her ideas of dramatic gesture were
apparently limited to a raising of the arm like a railway signal. The
applause throughout the opera was freely accorded and richly deserved.
Nothing better has been written for Carl Rosa Bince JBsmeralda,
also by Goring Thomas. The
story being a Russian one of serfs
and masters, may be described as
a regular knont-an'-knouter. I
congratulate Carl Rosa on a
splendid performance of a splendid
work.
Mr. John Thomas (Harpist to
the Q.UEEN) gave a concert of harp-
music on Saturday afternoon in
St. James's Hall, when the price
of the best seats was one guinea
each. He harped a good deal on his
own works, the programme of six-
teen items containing no less than
thirteen of his compositions or
arrangements. Perhaps it was
natural for him to be bis own
trumpeter, as Mr. Harper was not
there to blow for him. About a
dozen and a half other harpists
assisted Mr. Thomas in some con-
certed pieces—their performance should be notioed by the Sand of
Harp Review—and a regular bouquet of vocal talent, including the
names of Miss Mart Da vies, Madame Edith Wynne, Miss Gbiswold
and Mr. Winch, contributed to make the concert pass off harpily.
H importance is to be gauged by price, the Concert of Chevalier
B. Palmieri, on Monday last, at Steinway Hall, where a guinea was
charged for Stalls, should not pass unnoticed. Signor Erba, a really
conscientious and capable violinist, led the string quartette, and the
Chevalier manipulated the piano. This youthful Gentleman—only
twenty-three in his stockings—is nephew of the Italian Astronomer
who has an observatory on Mount Vesuvius. He is, besides, a very
clever pianist, and has already performed before "the principal
crowned heads of Europe."
Herr Josef Ludwig (violinist) and Madame Frickenhaus (pianist)
are the people to hear if you want a Concert of good chamber-music
For instance, at their last recital two pieces were performed for the
first time in London—a Violin Sonata, bv Oliver King—(evidently
not a Radioal, or he would have changed King into Cromwell)—and
a Septet, of exceeding interest, for the unwonted combination of
oboe, clarinet, horn, violin, viola, and piano, by Stsutbach.

course of the current Week.
3. a.m.—Roused by deputation from Court of Common Council to
come and see the sunrise from the top of the Blackfriars Railway
Station. Up and accompany them. Soon as it is over am hurried off
to the Borough Road to attend the early washing of the Greenwich
Tram Car Omnibuses, and then on to Rdtherhithe, to see how it looks
before five o'clock in the morning. Do it, and being overpersuaded
am shipped on board a tug, and taken down the Pool, being finally
landed at Billingsgate in time to witness arrival of first consignment
of fish for the day s market. Am thinking of getting away, when I
am met at the entrance by the Alderman of Dowgate Ward, who
invites me to breakfast with the Beefeaters at the Tower. Cannot but
accept, and we sit down, six-and-thirty at table. Health proposed
several times, and am booked by several City offioials to visit in turn
the West Indian Docks, the cellars under the Bank, the Main Sewer
at Barking, the Thames Tunnel, and the Stepney Baths and Wash-
houses. Make the best excuses I can and slip away, when no one is
looking, and get back to my hotel slightly out. of breath, and much
fatigued.
9. a.m.—Find correspondence awaiting me. Fifteen invitations to
City Companies' dinners, five being on the same night. Write to
accept all of them. Am also asked to Garden fetes, at nineteen
country seats, and to attend the laying of seven foundation stones,
the opening of a new break-water, and the inauguration of a popular
Palace for Inebriates. Say "Yes" to everything, and am about to
turn in to get a little rest, when the Lord Mayor is announced with
the City Maces. Have him shown in. Wants me to lunch with him
in the Ball at the top of St. Paul's, but first show me the City from
the knife-board of a Road Car Company's Omnibus, accompanied
by the Corporation, with the stringed. Band of the Royal London
Artillery Company inside. Drive up and down Cheapside several
times, ascending the steeples of all the City churches we come across,
and finally pull up in Columbia Market, stopping on the way at the
Mansion House to have the loving cup, and the statues of Gog and
Magog handed out to us. Getting very tired, manage again to creep
away and get back to my hotel unobserved and prepare once more to
turn in.
3 p.m.—Am just turning in when arrivals of Committees of several
learned Societies are announced. Am invited to attend lecture on
blasting powder and other explosives at Royal Institution; enter the
Bengal tigers' cage, at feeding-time, at the Zoological Society's
Gardens, Regent's Park; visit dissecting-room at South London
Hospital, and be present at adjourned meeting of Recuperated Male-
factors' Association. Am about to start to do all four of these, when
I am suddenly set upon by Deputy-Chairman of Anglo-Colonial
Federation, and carried off to take part in Inaugural Centennial Fete
at Agricultural Hall. On the way there try to dodge the Deputy-
Chairman, and escape, but can't manage it. Am no sooner then
than I am spotted once more by the Lord Mayor, who insists on mj
coming to five o'clock tea at the Mansion House, and am driven baci
in his State oarriage, with his Chaplain, the City Remembrancer
and a posse of Aldermen on the roof. Shows me over Newgate, the
Law Courts, Daily Telegraph Office, Metropolitan District Mansior
House Station, and the crypt of St. Clement s Danes, as we go along
Contrive to " miss" him as we are going up the Monument stairs U
see the sun set, and once more hurry back to my hotel, and, luck inj
my door, prepare to turn in, this time dead beat.
9 p.m.—Have just settled down comfortably into a quiet doze
when I am stirred up by thundering knocking. A special Deputa-
tion from the Corporation has come to insist on my coming at once ti
a Fanoy Ball at the Guildhall. Very sleepy. Urge that I hav(
nothing to go in. They say, "Nonsense!" and lend me an Alder
man's gown, and Sheriffs hat. Can't get out of it, and am oblige(
to go. Lord Mayor immensely civil—takes me out on roof, an<
shows me stars through an astronomical telescope. Gives me plao
of honour at supper, and makes me stand up for a Saraband wit]
the Lady Mayoress, and asking me just to try a quadrille with th
Archbishop of Canterbury, introduces me to the Authorities a
the Horse Guards, the members of the Steel Institute and th
Governor of Bedlam. Says I ought to see London by night, and th
way to do it is to take a through tieket all round the Metropolitai
Railway. Thank him for the hint, and say I '11 do it. Wait til
he's not looking, then bolt. He sends the City Remembrancer, am
three Liverymen after me to see that I don't get out of it. Give m;
Alderman's gown suddenly to a Policeman, then double. Manage 1
escape them. Get back to my hotel more dead than alive, and rei
my room at last. Lock my door, and vow, whatever happens .
morrow, to avoid the "City." Drop off to sleep, and dream I'
once again a free and unhampered man—in New Zealand.

Notes of il—liy the way.
Arrived at St. Paneras to find two hundred
thousand people surrounding the station in
every direction. Enthusiasm tremendous.
(Is my hat-box all right t) Horses taken out
of carriage, which is swept by the surging
multitude right into the first-class waiting-
room. Am met by the Chairman and Directors
of the Company, who, waving their hats
on the top of their umbrellas, form a line for
me to reach the pigeon-hole to pay my fare.
Do it, and have my hand seized by the ticket-
clerk, who refuses to let it go till I make a
speech. Address him for five minutes, and
tell him I must be off, because 1 am engaged
inagreat, noble, national, and Imperial under-
taking. Drag myself away from him. Crowd
wild with excitement. (Hope Wife has not
forgotten the pomatum - pot with voice
mixture.) Whole front of booking-office
pulled down. Am carried on portions of
the debris, on shoulders of porters, to my
saloon-carriage. Terrible scuffle to get in,
coat very nearly torn off my back. Twenty
others instantly offered by crowd. Select six,
and take them into carriage with me. Pressure
outside indescribable. Doors give way. Car-
riage invaded. Climb up into the netting, and
shake hands with everybody defiantly, in self-
defence. Floor eventually cleared by military.
( Wife can't find sandwiches or sherry).
Line opened up at last, and train begins to
move slowly out of the station. Appear at
window, and do a few steps of Highland
fling as an appropriate farewell. Rouses en-
thusiasm to fever-heat. Chairman of the
Company rushes along the platform, and
throws a bag of buns at me, nitting me on
head. [Useful, however, if Wife has forgotten
sandwiches. She can't find them. Thinks
they' rewith theboots in the bag.) Bow acknow-
ledgments, and indicate, in dumb show, that
I snail eat them on the way. Disappear in
the distance, waving my open umbrella, and
singing "Scots wha hae .'" at the top of my
voice. ( What does' Wha hae' mean,? Where's
my Homer ?' Home Rule' and 'Homer
Rule' might work into something, so Har-
COURT said. How f Not in Scotland.) When
fairly out of sight, collapse. Slowly come
round, and wonder whether it will be like this
all the way. Rest for a little while, but find we
are nearing Leicester. Prepare myself for
reception by putting on a clean collar.
Train enters station amidst a free fight
between the Local Authorities and Railway
Officials to get at the carriage. Local Autho-
rities carry the day, and burst in all the doors
at once. ( Wife thinks the sandwiches mutt
be in the dressing-bag. Where's my umbrella t)
Harangue them to keep them off, and tell
them that importing liberal principles into
Leicester is like carrying coals to Newcastle.
In middle of big speech—whistle—train off.
Just saved it, but barked my shins. (Where
has Wife put my books of reference, the
pomatum-pot, and the sandwiches f Where's
the Secretary t Left behind. And he's got

Merchant of Venice, Act III., Sc. 3.
Confuted to Hollo way.— Not satisfied with establishing a semi-
private Lunatic Asylum—we beg pardon, "Sanatorium"—at Vir-
ginia Water, the trustees under the will of the late Professor Hollo-
way, of happy Pill-and-Ointment memory, have built a College for
the better education of women in its near neighbourhood. No doubt
the idea in the revered founder's mind, when he bequeathed the twin
blessings to a grateful world, was that a female, if unwilling to enter
one of his institutions, thereby declared herself fit for the other.
A lady will now be able to spend her entire existenoe in Virginia
Water—say six years for learning everything in the College, and
the remainder of her life, for digesting the knowledge so acquired, in
;l the Sanatorium." Thus the old sequence will be still preserved—
first the bitter pill, and then the soothing ointment. May the
Holloway venture flourish in all its branches!
THE ISLINGTON CAMPAIGN.
(From the Front Seat of War.)
Bravo, B. Battery of B. Brigade! They can do it—rather!
Dashing at a hand-gallop with their cannon not to left of them, nor to
right of them, but behind them, right between the gate-posts, with-
out touching either. All the attractions were as great as ever. On
one day there were two accidents, and in each case Captain Dann
ran down the tan and back to salute the Prince and Princess,
and report, "No one hurt, your Royal Highnesses," and on we goes
again. From the Musical Bide of the Second Life Guards, the civilian
would be able to gather how our Household Troops behaved in
Egypt. The Musical Ride in time of war must be a most useful
accomplishment—that is, if the enemy has learnt it as well; but if
not, they would rather put our men out.
The Cavalry displays delighted everybody. To commence with,
in came furze-bushes, stuck on hurdles. I suppose these are always
carried about by our troops for the purpose of hiding behind them
and firing. Who was the furze't to introduce this? By the way,
they won t serve for " firing" in oold weather; but that, I take it,
is not their primary object. The soldiers get their horses to lie down,
the audience, representing the enemy, applauding. Then the soldiers
also lie down on the tan, and fire at the audience. This naturally
made a hit, and that portion of the audience who were not being
fired at, applauded vigorously. Up got horses, men on them, bugle
sounded, off they galloped, and that scene was finished.
The Third King's Own showed how their horses were trained to
carry two outside. This must be very useful after many a dinner-
party. By the way, after which " Third King" were these heroes
called P 1 ask as a civilian, and a civil question demands a military
answer.
The Fifth Royal Irish Lancers came in riding gallantly—mighty
fine are the O'Blazers, be dad, Sorr—apparently practising how to
spear black-beetles in the tan, and then doing something with their
lances aa if they were fishing. Afterwards they charged; then
they charged again. The Fifth cannot now adopt the proud motto,
"No Extra Charge." Then some of them sat down to tea and
tobacco—which raised the audience to an unprecedented pitch of
enthusiasm, for an audience is always deeply interested in any eating
and drinking on the stage—it is the one touch of nature whioh,"
&c.—and one soldier walks up and down, guarding them during
their repast, all the time casting hungry and thirsty glances at his
messmates, while another rides away with his lance, perhaps to
spear a muffin, and toast it on the spot. Not succeeding in this, he

fires a blank cartridge at nothing in particular, and returns to his
comrades to tell them what he has done, which so disturbs them,
that they hurriedly pack up their tea-things, mount, ride away, and
then hide behind the furze, and take pot-shots at a densely crowded
part of the audience labelled " Refreshment Contractors."
I did not see the lief reshment Contractors retaliate, hut I think
they must have done so, as one of the soldiers fell over, evidently in
great pain, perhaps from a Bath-bun which had caught him right in
the middle, and lodged there. What were his companions to do?
No doctor or surgeon handy; still as they are Lancers, the evident
answer is, "Lance him." But they don't. They take off their
jackets, they make a stretcher with them and the lances, and they
carry off their unfortunate companion, who all this time has been
squirming about, face downwards, in the tan, in agonies of pain. He
was only purtendin, and is evidentlv a born actor. Now. on the
stretcher he is a borne-off actor. Exit the Regimental Roscnrs.
Great applause.
Then Captain Tann—I should say Dann—announces "the Tenth
Prince of Wales's Own Hussars "—whereat the people cheer lustily,
and great curiosity is expressed to see what tricks H.R.H. has
taught his own Hussars to perform. If they had brought out ten
chairs, and H.R.H. had walked into the circus, carrying a silver-
mounted riding-whip, and followed by his ten highly trained
Hussars, no one would have been much surprised, and the oheering
would have been redoubled. However, what did happen was, that
eight out of the ten Hussars (where was "the Tenth?" he was
a cannon, I should say. Like Mr. Snodgrass out shooting, he "lets
it off," and then, not to put too fine a point upon it, hooks it. Is
this what H.R.H. has taught him? Then the eight clever Hussars,
observing that there is no one about, not even a policeman, bravely
gallop up to the gun, capture it, and ride off with it amid the enthu-
siastic plaudits of the audience. "Where was the tenth of the
Hussars? nine were accounted for. Oh, of course H.R.H. himself
is the tenth, and he taught them all this. Very pretty. But how
H.R.H. finds the time to do it is a marvel to everybody.
The grand finish, the " Combined Display of ail Arms," invented
and arranged by Lieut.-Colonel Onslow, Inspector of Gymnasia for
Great Britain, is so remarkable for the celerity of the performance,
that Lieut.-Colonel Onslow ought to be properly re-named " Lieut-
Colonel On-quick," as he has trained the soldiers to camp, strike,
fight a battle, build a bridge, bring in a mounted battery, scatter our
enemies, confound their knavish tricks, and storm the fortress to the
tune of "Mule Britannia" all in something under seven minutes.
Wonderful I Back I go from Dank to Belgravia, not exclaiming
that all is barren, and am yours, Cms Westendexsis.
It was supposed that Mr. Gladstone's candidature would he suc-
cessfully contested in Mid-Lothian by a Conservative party of the
name of Walker. Where is that party now? Is there any opposi-
tion P And the Liberals, not the Conservatives this time, answer
with a shout of " Walker!"
Divorce Court Dance Measure. — Old Tunes revived! The
"Hannen Polka."
