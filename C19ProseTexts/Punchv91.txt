PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A S the Old Year neared its ending, Mr. Punch a vision had,
n Strangely mingling many matten, old and new, and grave and glad.
Dreamland's ways are mad and motley, and the vision ebbed and flowed
Shifting as the shapes of Fashion, or a rural J P.'s code.
* * * * *
Locksley Hall! Л mellow piping lifts above the curlew's cry;
'Tie our throstle-throated Laureate having just another try.
Echoes of our youth ring through it, mingled with the minor moan
Murmuring of departed passions, and illusions long outgrown.
*****
Then—0 Gates of Horn and Ivory! is your world without a plan ?—
Stretched upon a cosy couch there liea, and smiles, a Fasting Man!
He is sleek and he is rosy, no emaciated Shade,
Like MERLATTI, JAQUES, or SDCCI, members of the strange new trade.
"Bah! Competitive Starvation is unmitigated trash!"
Mutters humbug-hating PUNCHIUS, and his ardent optics flash.
"Ugly Ugolino business, gathering morbid gobemouches round,
Making suffering a show, all for 'gate-money,' I'll be bound.
"Could they now, the charlatans, contrive to teach the famished poor
How in these distressful times to keep the grim wolf from the door;
"How to starve with ease and comfort, whilst the Poor Law Guardians prate
As to whether Hunger's harrying is 'exceptionally great,'
"Then the dolts might do some service. But their abstinence from grub ?—
Purposeless as Channel swims or shooting rapids in a tub!
"Yet this fellow's gills are rosy, he 's as plump as Christmas suet.
Starving seems to suit you, Mister. How the dickens do you do it?"
Then the Faster's ruddy visage corrugated with a wink,
And he showed a flask in which a liquor bright did bead and blink.
"This is my Elixir Vitie!" And he popped it on the table.
"PUNCH'S SPIRIT-ESSENCE" gleamed in golden letters on the labal.
* . * * * *
"Chaos, Cosmos! Cosmos, Chaos! Who can tell how all will end?"
Piped the Poet. "Come," cried PUNCH, "cheer up, my dithyrambic friend!

"Yours is such a Christmas Present as no man save you could give!
When our 'tonguesters' all are silent, Locksley Hall, my Lord, shall live;
"Sweet with all your springtide's sweetness, strong with all your summer'a force,
Minstrel, a mellifluous marvel, crowning well your royal course!
"Yet an undertone too hopeless mars tbe music's golden chimes,
And a 'noble rage' o'erhasty rings along its rolling rhymes.
"Keep up your postic pecker! What we want is patient pluck.
Punch, though often shocked and saddened, is not down upon his luck.
'"Ancient founts of inspiration well through all my fancy yet.'
Z'm not given wholly up to rhapsodies of wild regret.
"Still 'I doubt not through the ages one unceasing purpose runs,'
Still, though you have turned it up, I hold we're better than the Huns.
"They had not a 'PUNCH,' my Poet, nor a Laureate like you.
Bard, your latest lay, though lovely, is a bit too black and blue.
"Hopeless, because placemen babble, and some men are mere^ brutes?
Bali! The Corybantes' clangour should not drown Arcadia's flutes.
"AMY maddened you when young, DEMOS distracts your riper age.
Must you grip the scourge of KCSKIS, ape CABLTLE'S dyspeptic rage?
"' Cast the poison from your bosom, cast the madness from your braio,'
Read your PUNCH and puff your pipe; ALFRED will be himself again.
"Take the tip from this plump Faster! Puro Punch-Essence is enough.
It will quicken life and purge the bosom from all perilous stuff.
"With its sweetness wet your whistle. And, lest short of it you run,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
1.1.

ELECTIONEERING IN THE GRAND OLD MANNER.
(By Our Lightning Impressionist.)
FOLLOWING the lead of one of your contemporaries, with an open
mind and a blank note-book, I dashed amongst the Metropolitan
Candidates, determined to ascertain their political principles. My
first visit was to Mr. T. H. BOLTON, of North Saint Paneras, who met
me in Gray's-Inn Square.
"Mr. BOLTON, Sir," I said preparing my pencil, " I believe I am
right in saying, that you have carried a Bui legalising some very
extraordinary ties?"
"I have. Sir," returned the Hon. Gentleman, exultingly placing
his right hand near his shirt-collar, and smoothing an effective
"arrangement" in silk. "I have, Sir, and shall now go about in
peace—without molestation."
"And what do you think of Mr. GLADSTONE?"
"One of the greatest Statesmen of the day."
Perfectly satisfied with Mr. BOLTON'S views, I rushed off to see
Sir JOHN LTTBBOCK, who it will be remembered, represents the London
University. I found the Hon. Baronet tending some bees.
"Sir JOHN, I think we owe to you the Bank Holiday, which has
given so many weary clerks a day's leisure?"
"You are very good indeed to say so," he replied. "Yes, I think
the statutory twenty-four hours of recreation, which I assisted in
establishing, have made the country better."
"They have indeed," I returned heartily, "nothing could be more
delightful than a seaside place, after it has been invaded by a herd
of Bank-Holiday trippists. And now, about Mr. GLADSTONE— what
do you say about him?"
I think him one of the greatest Statesmen of the day."
Thus assured that Sir JOHN LUBBOCK, was the beet possible
candidate for a Liberal constituency, I made my way with the least
possible delay, to Sir JULIAN GOLDSJIID. I found that amiable
gentleman taking lunch with Mr. BLÜNDELL MAPLE.
"What are your opinions. Sir JÜLIAÍÍ?" I asked.
"That my worthy friend here, is the best man in the world, and
that nothing could exceed the grace, utility, the wearability of his
furniture."
"Pray, stop," I said, as I noticed on the cheek of Mr. BLÜNDELL
МАЛ.Е, a ilignt blush. "Banish from vonr mind all thoughti of the
Establishment in the Tottenham Court Aoad."
"Which is unique and in the long run most economical," cried Sir
JULIAN, enthusiastically.
"And tell me, what you think of Mr. GLADSTONE."
"One of'the greatest Statesmen of the day."
These three visits, must serve as a sample of the rest. Go where'I
would, I heard but one opinion—that the Grand Old Man was indeed
the noblest and best of Premiers. Under these circumstances, can
there be a doubt of the result of the Election?

Revival of Wonders.
IN the log uf the Bacchante it is seriously and circumstantially
stated that no less than thirteen persons witnessed a veritable appa-
rition of the Flying Dutchman. What next? Of course the Sea
Serpent may be expected shortly to turn up açain, and nobody will
wonder at a full, true, and particular report ot the reappearance of
the Wandering Jew.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, June 21.—Quite a crowd in
the Lords. Markiss early in his place, his black beard bristling
with_ threats of war. The gentle GRANVILLE absent, still confined
to his room by his ancient enemy. In such circumstances the
Markiss more than ever truculent. Only GBANVILLE, with his
benignant smile, his drawling voice, his lisped r's, and his courteous
manner, can stand before the Markiss. SHEBBBOOKE might do it.
At one time thought he would. But SHERBBOOKB blinks from a
back bench, and takes no part in any fray. Evidently finally taken
off his armour, and put away his lance.
Presently cause of battle-array explained. In other House Sage
of Queen Anne's Gate, getting up early in the morning, succeeded
in adding to Returning Officers' Charges' Bill Clause throwing
Returning Officers' costs on Rates, so making possession of wealth
less necessary on part of Parliamentary Candidate. Evidently this
would never do. SPENCER, with pretty air of doing nothing par-
ticular, moved Second Reading of Bill. KIMBEHLEY pleaded in vain
for compromise. Markiss scornfully brushed suppliants aside, gave
an incidental left-hander to GLADSTONE, and declared he would have
none of the Commons' Amendments. Ministers capitulated, and the
Markiss, stepping over their prostrate bodies, returned to his Castle.
In the Commons STAFFOBD HOWAED read long caper on Indian
Finances. House moderately full at question-time; over two
hundred present. But before HOWARD rose, great majority had
disappeared, and, ere he sat down, had read all but thirty-two out.
RANDOLPH, in sole possession of Front Opposition Bench, listened
with interest. _ Made frequent notes. Evidently about to make
a speech. Which he did. A faint wave of interest when he
rose, but didn't last. RANDOLPH temporarily blown himself out in
his blast against the Good Old Man. Dull and ргозу to last degree.
Business done.—Indian Budget introduced.
Tuesday, 1'IOA.M.— House still sitting. Expected when wecame
down last nicht proceedings would last only an hour or two. Safe to
be home to dinner. Bat they dragged on over midnight, and here
we are in a languid House beginning to blaze up in anticipation of
row. Ireland, of course. Parnellites wanted to go into Committee
on Municipal Franchise (Ireland) Bill. C. LEWIS opposed, and took
division. For going into Committee, 66; against, 17. BRODBICK
moved to report progress. "How many are you ?" asked COCTHTNEY
in the Chair. Only fourteen rose ;in response to challenge. That
not enough to justify division. Parnellites wildly cheered. LEWIS
raised cry of despair. Useless, he says, for any Member of Oppo-
sition to take part in discussion. "Let us leave them to it," said
BEODEICK; and the fourteen, rising, shook the dust of the House
from off their feet, and haughtily quitted the Chamber amid up-
roarious mirth of Irish Members. As soon as they were gone, Bill
passed through Committee, and Irish Members went home jubilant.
Business done.—ST. JOHN BEODEICK shocked.
Thursday.—A melancholy gathering to-night. The end of all
things at hand. Few Members present talk in subdued voices, as if
the corpse of the Parliament of 1886 were actually laid-out on the
table where the Mace reposes. Irish Members try to get up row
upon Belfast Main Drainage Bill. But it falls very flat. The
Sage of Queen Anne's Gate denounces the action of the Lords in the
matter of Returning Officers' Expenses Bill. "Monstrous!" he cries
aloud. "The House of Commons in the position of slaves to the
House of Lords!" But he would not press his objection to the
point of division, "leaving," he said, "my country as judge between
the Lords and the people.
RANDOLPH, faithful to the last, tried his hand at stirring the
stagnant waters. Sir GEOBGE CAMPBELL on Monday had said some-
thing virtuous about retirement of an Indian Official upon a pension,
and his subsequent appointment to a salaried office. CAMPBELL
ümself, RANDOLPH pointed out, had retired upon a pension at the
age of fifty, which was certainly the prime of life; "if not," he
added, casting a critical glance at Sir GEORGE sitting opposite,
nursing his knee, "to judge from the Hon. Gentleman's present
appearance, a period of absolute youth." Sir GEOBGE attempted to
explain the difference. V He (Sir GEORGE) was in receipt not of a
pension, but of an annuity; at which fine distinction the House
groaned, and getting itself Counted Out, went off to dinner.
Business done.—All!
Friday.— Prorogation. Old story over again, with its prevailing
tone of depression and its fringe of absurdity. The five respectable
Peers disguised in red gowns and cocked hats, seated on the Woolsack;
one or two noble Lords in mufti, on the otherwise desolate benches.
To them enter the SPEAKER, in wig and gown, accompanied by
Sergeant-at-Arms, carrying mace and followed by indispensable
Chaplain. Six months ago, when new House met, a turbulent mob
fought and scrambled behind the SPEAKEB, anxious for precedence.
To-day comes a straggling throng of dejected senators, not quite
certain that they will visit the scene any more. PETEB used to keep
his spirits up, even in these depressing circumstances. But PETEB is
away, fighting with the beasts at Burnley. Members miss his friendly
slap on the shoulders, his hum-irons digitals seeking their ribs, and
the sound of his hearty laughter. Will he come back again as a
Leader among the Conservatives? Who shall say that, or much else
about which men wonder.
Business done.—Parliament prorogued.

And they do the thing bravely in

For lamps will illumine each

And the bride will be hid,
In a mantle of gold.

In the wise days of old;
For they love ancient customs in

And all antique lore can unfold.

With a hat on her head,

And be borne, 'tis the custom in

In a big sedan-chair, painted

And rich presents she '11 spy,
Ancient porcelain made.
Like " Yu thang khia khi,'
In the Hall of the Jade;
They were great at such vases in
China,
Most nobly adorned and inlaid.
Here 's your health then, К WANG-

Let barbarians say,
That they wish luck to you,
On your near wedding-day;
May you long live to rule over

And hold a beneficent sway.

FOE THE NEXT THEOLOGICAL EXAM.—How can there
be any reasonable difficulty as to the story of JONAH.
when we know there are at this present time hundreds of
people, including Madame PATTI, living in Wales?
JEALOUSY.—Lord TENNYSON was horrified at the notion
of the Freshwater Railway. The Poet Laureate doesn't
like any lines but his own.
VESPEILE AMBROSIAN^.
ANOTHER of Mr. AMBROSE AUSTIN'S Concerts at the Albert Hall on
Wednesday last, with English CUSINS, not one of the Cusins German,
conducting the excellent orchestra. A very attractive programme.
First came Signor FOLI—whom Mrs. RAMSBOTHAM always will call
Signer FOL-LOL-LI,—who gave us a grand air from VERDI'S Nabuco,
and his powerful voice would have filled the hall, if it had not been
already crammed in every part—that is, as far as I could see.
Then Miss EMILY WIN ANT treated us to the Handelian "Awake,
Saturnia !" which did not arouse the audience to great enthusiasm;
not that this was in any way due to the singer, but to the uninterest-
ing character of the song, and to the fact that we were all waiting
for PATTI. The Diva, from Wales, sang Bel raggio from Sémi-
ramide, ("one of ROSSINI'S half-finished Operas" Mrs. RAMS-
BOTHAM thinks; "or if not, why did he call it Semi-Ramide'1 ")—and
after the Dolce pentiero, she was recalled four times, but did not
"oblige again."
Then we all pulled ourselves together to hear the Concert-Stück on
the pianoforte by VLADIMIR DE FACHMANN. But at this point the
Concert stuck, for the unfortunate VLADIMIR was kept away from us
by indisposition, and didn't appear.
Madame TREBKLLI, in splendid costume, and still more splendid
voice, sang " Vient che poi sereno," which was so all serene-o that
she was enthusiastically encored; whereupon she gracefully returned,
and earned fresh applause by giving Carmen's first song.
The next number was to be "Scena and Chorus, 'Miter ere' (II
Troratore),VERDI. By Madame ADELINA PATTI and Mr. SIMS
REEVES. Harp and Harmonium Obbligati, Messrs. LOCKWOOD and
L. ENGEL." Everybody on the tip-toe of expectation. Would
SIMS REEVES come? Movement among audience. Buzz. "He's
coming!" All hands ready to receive him. Here he is ... No
he isn t ... Sigh of disappointment on the appearance of a very
respectable elderly gentleman, who, it strikes us, as he stands anxi-
ously and closely scrutinising the audience through his pince-nez.
has oeen sent on by the Management to look round the house and
ascertain if by any chance SIMS REEVES is sitting among the
audience; in which case this Scrutator has been authorised to send
for a policeman, and have him fetched out, and brought bodily on
to the platform. Failing in his attempt to discover SIMS REEVES,
he directs his attention to the harmonium, from which we gather
that he is one of the "Obbligati" mentioned in the programme.
Presently the other Obbligato enters, and goes to his harç; a crowd
of men, having somewhat the air of poucemen in plain clothes,
now come on to the platform; and it occurs to us, as not altogether
improbable, that the Manager, dissatisfied with the result of Mr.
Obbligato Senior's reoonnoitering, is employing a strong body of
detectives and constables in undress to institute a search for the
missing tenor. However, as they don't move off the stage, but
huddle up together, in a shy and sheeplike way, in a corner, the
idea gradually breaks upon tue audience that this body of men re
sent the Chorus, which, in the Opera, is behind the scenes.
And now enter ADELINA—and there is a ray of hope that Siirs
REEVES will yet, after all, and after everybody, appear. For where
is Manrico, when this scene is performed on the operatic stage? In
sight? No. He is shut up in prison, and sings from behind prison
walls,—which must be a rare treat to walls that have ears. So, to
keep up the illusion, perhaps our Great English Tenor is to be " heard
without." We all hope for the best.
So Obbligato Senior starts the harmonium, and the constables in
plain clothes begin their lugubrious chant, and PATTI, as Leonora,
is as brilliant as she can be in a depressed sort of way, showing by a
certain nervous anxiety, that she has not been let into the secret of
the Eminent Tenor's hiding-place, and being evidently fearful that
he may oome out, with his solo, at any moment, and startle the life
out of her. The Diva turns an anxious glance towards the entrance
at the back, to which all eyes are now eagerly directed in feverish
expectation that SIMS REEVES'S voice will issue from that quarter, and
that he himself will be subsequently conducted out of his ambush by
Conductor CUSINS, to receive the plaudits of the delighted audience.
Obbligato Junior, on the harp, commences. Now where—0 where—
is SIMS REEVES? In prison? . . . Hark! . . . A voice singing
the famous "Ah che la morte!" We regard one another silently
but blankly, as if saying, "This is not the voice of SIMS REEVES!"
No ; it is the voice of a Tenore Robust»—a tremendous busto! As
far as SIMS REEVES is concerned, there is one portion of tke prison-
scene represented here, for it is, emphatically, "a cell." Who is
it? Nobody knows. It is very kind of him, of course, whoever it is.
But the audience do not appear to be sufficiently grateful when
PATH leads forward M. NICOLINI, who in this instance is the
change for the other tenner.
In the Second Part Signor FOL-LOL-LI sang " Oh, Ruddier," and
most of us wish he bad made a better selection. Then Mr.
Obbligato Senior strolls in, puts on his pince-nez, suddenly comes on a
piano, smiles, and evidently says to himself, " Why, dear me, here 's
the very thing I want. I '11 go and tell PATH," and so he is going,
when PATTI saves him farther trouble by stepping on to the platform,
as fresh as ever, with a piece of music in her hand, with which she
forthwith proceeds to delight us, being accompanied by Obbligato
Senior, who turns out to be Mr. L. ENGEL, the composer of the song.
He plays the accompaniment as if he were thoroughly enjoying him-
self. It is a music-hally kind of air, but it is so etherealised by PATTI's
singing, that she is warmly encored ; whereupon, greatly to the delight
of Obbligato Senior, hut rather to the disappointment of the audience,
who hoped that she would followTREBELLi's example, and sing some-
thing else, she repeated "Darling Mine"—a title suggestive of Rio
Tintos, My sores, or Montanas, when paying from fifteen to twenty-five
per cent. After one song from TREBELLI and an aria from PATTI, we
sought something airer still in the grounds of " The Colinderies," and
if we 've any luck, we shall expect to hear the Great Invisible SIMS
REEVES at the next Ambrosial Concert on Saturday week.

OFF!
FOOT to foot, at fullest strain,
Muscles tense and beating brain.
Forward knee and clenched band,
See the rival champions stand!
See them straining on the start,
Masters of the runner's art,
Feet a-spring for the first bound,
Toes that barely touch the ground,
Breath ingathered, watchful eyes;
What a race, for what a prize!
As the champions toe the scratch,
Scarce it looks an equal match.
Sturdy manhood doth not wage
Equal war with silvered age.
But the veteran in this race
Is a marvel. Power and pace
Fail him not for all his years,
Odds he laughs at, mocks at fears.
Spare, steel-sinewed, springv still,
Fleet of foot and firm of will,
Confident and cheery, he
Struggles for the mastery,
With whatever comer dares
Challenge him. He nothing cares
For disparity of age,
Lifting every rival's gage.
Yet, though steely still and stout,
WILL hath here his work cut out.
Swarthy CECIL, stern and grim
As Black Douglas, bears with
him
All the hopes of many a man
Who till late, when WILLIAM ran,
Backed him with his voice and
cash.
Now, for all his fire and dash,
Many a backer falls away.
Deeming WILL has had his day.
Yon Corinthian, CAVENDISH,
Cuts him ; if he hath his wish
WILL, whom he was wont to back,
Will not win upon this track.
Birmingham's pedestrian pet
Odds against him longs to bet;
Fancies he himself might win,
If against him he cut m.
Many another ancient friend,
Once thought faithful to the end,
Of allegiance firm and fixed,
Slips from him. The crowd is
mixed.
Hosts who cheered him on of old,
Now are hostile, or are cold;
Doubtful of his course and cause.
Whispering that his friends'
applause
Is but tribute to his pluck,
Out of form, and out of luck.
Time will tell. The time's at
hand.
WILL, the runner, old yet grand,
Sets his foot and sets his face
Once more to the goal. His race,
Whether lost or whether won,
Will he fairly, gamely run.
All, however stout or fast,
Must give in to time at last.
If once more he is returned
"WILL the Winner," 'twill be
earned
By a blend of pace and stay
None will match for many a day.
If, from choosing a wrong course,
Or mismeasuring his force,
He should lose this crowning race,
Failure will not bring disgrace.
Fortune shifts, youth wiL be
served;
Since he never shirked or swerved.
They who triumph need not scoff
At the veteran. Hush! they're
off!

DR. MOBKLL MACKENZIE has written a learned work on The
Hygiene of the Vocal Organs, which Messrs. MACMILLAN have
published in one volume of sound—that is in one good sound volume.
Excellent advice is given in it, and words of wisdom are spoken bv
Dr. MORELI, MACKENZIE, when he attributes "the great lack of good
voices" nowadays, to the "feverish hurry and impatience of modern
life, which makes pupils and teachers alike most anxious for imme-
diate success, however ephemeral, than for lasting results." Ohne
Hast aber ohne Rast, is the moral of MORELL MACKENZIE'S advice.
THIS cutting from the Daily Telegraph potted :—
LADY'S MAID and SECRETARY and VALET.—WANTED, A
married couple, without children, to travel with a Lady and Gentleman.
The wife must be a thorough lady'« maid, and understand dresamnking, hair-
dressing, and be strong, active, and a good packer. The husband must
understand shorthand, and be a good writer, and be willing to perform all
the duties of a secretary, butler, and valet, and ride on the carnage out of
liven*. The wages for the two would be £52 per annum, and everything
fauna.—Address by letter, with fullest detailed particulars, in husband's
handwriting, to .
This appeared about a fortnight ago. We wonder if the Adver-
tiser has yet found this wonderful couple. That he is an old soldier
is evident from the final condition as to the handwriting.
SOMETHING QUITE NEW,—The Prefect of Police in Paris is going

most crowded parts of the Metropolis. Aha! So, at last, "They
manage these things better in London."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ROBERT AT THE ACADEMY.
OE gum long time past I 've
bin a thinking how wery
Hartestick all the world's a
becoming, leastways all sich
people as is anybody, such
as Lords, Hem Peas, Haider-
men, Haotors, and Hed
Waiters. In my own par-
tickler case, it shows now
use accustoms us to strange
bedf ellers! I remember
the fust time as I ever seed
a reel grand fust rate Picter
Gallery, witch it was at the
Hague in Olland, I was that
shockt, that I was quite
glad to get away for fear
anybody should see me as
knowed me. But after the
fust blush of the thing, so
to speak, I got jest as brazen
as the rest of the people,
and can now go and have
a look at the werry how-
dashusest of the hole lot,
without even blinking. I 'ye
still that little grace left in
me that I prefers to go
alone, and woodn't go with
a reel lady as I loved and
respected, no not for untold
gold, which I presumes
means preshus little. But
I begins to feel as I'm a
tredding on dangerous
ground, so I'd best leave it
afore the hice gives way.
So with the werry nateral
question who buys the Staggerers? I passes on.
The werry fust person as I met on my wisit to the Academy the
other day, was a old frend of mine in the shoemaking line. He was
a coming out, as I was a going in, so he had only time to say, don't
forget Mr. ROBERT, to have a good look at the boots as the hartists
paints, and then you'll see what dunces they are in that most im-
portant respect. There 's hardly one of their best portraits as coud
walk in 'em. That's wot I calls reel critticism. The fust thing as
caught my eye in the werry fust room, was what I was told was a
etuddy in pink and white, and so it was, litorally, for the dress was
all pink and white, and the face was all white excep a nice little pink
noee. How charmed the lady must be with the hartist's truthfulness.
It.'s jist the same in another pictur, where the pore gentleman's
breakings out all over his pore face, is all done to a pimpel. Nothink
like truthfulness in Boots, but in regard to sum faces, I shoud
recomend jist a leetle play of fansy.
Finding as there wasn't not no names on the picture, I was forced
to buy a Catlog to see what they was all about, but strange to say it
wasn't hardly of no use. For instance now, there's a great Pictur of
a werry powerful gent, with werry few clothes on, a carrying off a
lady wno don't appear to have none, and one on 'em has upset a salad
bowl, and I was of coarse natrally ankshus to know which did it, and
why, and why he didn't give her time to dress herself, poor thing,
afore he carried her off, and how it is as he looks as if he did that
sort of thing about wunce a week, and thort nothink of it, and why
he sticks out his chest so, and dubbles his fist to show as he doesn't
mean to stand no nonsense. So I looks at my shilling Catlog, and
what do I find? "Cassandra," by SOLOMON SOLOMON, and that's
all I and all I can say furder is, that if CASSANDEA behaved in that
shameful way to the poor lady, he ought to be ashamed of himself,
even if she did upset the bowl. Then there 's another won almost as
neat a staggerer as the other. Fancy about a dozen full-grown
ladies going out a hunting of a pore little rabbit, with both his four
legs a broken, on such a remarkabel hot summer day as makes 'em all
wear no clothes to speak of, except a scarf or two, and having a
cuppel of leppards, tied together like two gray hounds, to help 'em,
and one of the demme semme nude ladys a squeezing a cupple of
snakes to death, and all on em with great big spears, a hurling on em
at the pore little rabbit, doesn't one want to nave it all explained. I
knows as it must be in Burnham Beeches, coz I nose the trees, but I
wants to know to which great Bnckenhamsneer family they all belongs,
and wot does the Catlog tell me ?" Meenads. by Hon. JOHK COLLTEH,"
and that 's all! Then all I can say is, whatever might have been
thort of the Miss Menads. hunting on foot in that shameless costoom,
when the Burnham Beeches was private propperty, that now that it
belongs to the Copperashun, it ort to be put a stop to, or we shall have
the Committee going down there too or three times a week, to see
whether it 's still a going on.
But the best of the fun is that where you don't require not no ex-
planation, because the pictur speaks for itself, then you gets it in
full. Take for instance the picter that to my mind is the gem of the
whole lot, the pictur that pulled me up sharp, direcly I seed it, and
that I studded agane and agane, afore I could tare myself away. It 's
a pictur of a Luncheon in the country, and such a Luncheon! there 's
fust of all a game pie, and then a cut Am, and then such a perfecly
lovely peace of streaky cold rost Beef, as makes yer mouth warter ony
to look at, and a bottle of Sherry, and setterer, and then jest to give
the natterai finishing touch to the hole, there 's a keen-looking elderly
party, a pouring hisself out a foaming glass of old ale, before any of
the otner Gents has arrived, tho you can see 'em a coming in the
distance. I turns to my Catlog and I am told it 's " The Sportsmen's
Luncheon," why of course it is, but fancy my estonishment to find as
it 's painted by a lady, Miss EDITH НАТЫЛЕ, and I hails her ac-
cordingly. But I ought to have dishcovered that too, for I werry
much dout if any R. A. of the whole lot, could have painted such a
perfecly marwellus tablecloth! I noticed two things as most of the
painters paints werry well, and them's Donkeys and Pigs, whether
there 's any partickler reason for this, it is not for me to say, or
weather any moral is to be drawn therefrom, but, ewen if so, I trust
as I knows as them is misterys far too deep for my plumber to sound. ROBERT.
DIGNITY AND IMPUDENCE;
OE, RANDOLPH ON THE RAMPAOB.
The following Address has been issued to the Electors of S—th
P-dd-ngt-n :—
GENTLEMEN,
IT is time that somebody should speak out. Nature has
never cried aloud to me for repose, or even for a becoming modesty
in the expression of my political views, and if Nature had done so, I
should not have listened to her. Speaking with as much impartiality
as I can possibly muster, and carefully avoiding the least exuberance
of language, I now denounce Mr. GLADSTONE'S Bill as a nefarious
and rascally mixture of vanity, bunkum, blarney, misprision of
treason, flat burglary, and political arson, for which the very least
punishment that ne deserves is penal servitude for the remainder of his
ill-spent existence. Some may think my expressions exaggerated,
though in my opinion they are ridiculously weak, and when I really
set myself to it, I can call ever so much worse names than these!
Without some degree of plain-speaking, how on earth is the country
and my own reputation—especially the latter—to be preserved? If
you want a puff you must be tart. The man who hesitates—to
impute motives and sling Billingsgate—is lost in modern English
poutics. We have now to deal with an opponent who combines the
worst qualities of NBBO, MACHIAVELII, NAPOLEON the Great, SANCHO
Рлх/л, BLUE it ЕЛКИ, and the late Mr. PEACE. England is suffering
from " One-Man Rule." and it is for that reason alone, and, as you
can imagine, with an almost inconceivable amount of reluctance, that
I dwell so much on the personal aspects of the question, a course
which as a general rule, I am known most studiously to avoid.
Our chief antagonist is called the " Grand Old Man." I think the
whole controversy will be raised on to a much higher and more
statesmanlike level, if I call him at once the Grand Old Donkey.
Or to put it still more convincingly, instead of " One-Man Rule," we
are in danger of One-Maniac Rule! You, Gentlemen, who are—
some of you-—destined to be the progenitors of a numerous posterity,
(none of whom I trust you will see reason to leave unsupported, and
in consequence chargeable to the parish,) know well that the Home-
Rule Bill was bred in Bedlam, and hatched at Colney Hatch, and
that for mingled imbecility, poltroonery, dare-devil recklessness,
superhuman cunning, and utter idiocy, it has never been equalled.
The Conservative Party has the support of men like Mr. BEIOHT,
Mr. DALE, and Mr. SPUEGEON,—men whose opinions in the past,
it has treated with such unvarying deference and respect! Do
you want to see India lost, Burmah abandoned, all our Colonies
declaring war on us, Heligoland showing signs of disloyalty, the
Samoan Islanders mutinous, and an active volcano established in
Hyde Park? If you don't, vote as one man (or one sheep), for me,
and the cause of political moderation and morality 1

MEMS. AT COMMEMORATION.
Picked up by an Ice Fail.

OUR ARTIST'S DREAM OF COMMEMORATION WEEK AT OXFORD.
UNCOMMONLY hot at this toirée, but being conveniently placed
under the refreshment counter, managed to catch a good deal of the
casual conversation going on overhead. Gather, amid general talk
about Show Sunday, the two Balls, Procession of Boats, and other
local matters, that the lions of the evening have just arrived in the
shape of a distinguished Radical Statesman and well-known Trage-
dian. They are sure to want a cup of tea, and so they '11 soon pro-
bably turn up here, and I shall hear what they 've got to say. I
thought so. Here they are, and the Warden is introducing them.
They appear not to have met before. The distinguished Radical
Statesman, who is fairly stout, has white hair, and does not wear an
eyeglass, is explaining to the well-known Tragedian, that he has come
up because, much to his astonishment, they have intimated to him
their intention of conferring on him the honorary degree of D.C.L.
Says he can't think what on earth he has done in their eyes to merit
the honour, unless it be that his recent political turn-about-face has
had something to do with it. "It is like asking me to put my head
in the lion's mouth," he adds.
The well-known Tragedian listens attentively, and, adjusting his
pince-nez, turns to the War-
den, and asks, it struck me
in a melancholy voice, for
what sort of services these
"honorary degrees " were
conferred. The reply was,
that any remarkable work
in any line of life made one
eligible as a recipient.
"Then why should I,"
asks the Tragedian, bitterly,
"be left outin the cold?"
'' Surely," rejoin the others
in a breath, "they are going
to give you something on
Wednesday?"
"Nothing, my good Sirs,"
answered the Tragedian,
"absolutely nothing—
'Degree, or no degree, that ia
the question.'"
He continued, with a sub-
acid smile—
'"Yet have I done the Stage
eome service.'"
And, as he folds his arms and
takes 'the room, I think he
would have quoted several

Chorus of Oxford Done refusing Mephietophcles a Degree.
appropriate passages from the Immortal. Bard to fortify his case, had
not hie interlocutors coughed him down with wellbred empressement.
"Never mind," they say; "there has been some mistake. Depend
upon it, they will find it out, and give it you some other year."
The Tragedian looks annoyed. "But I wish it now," he says.
"It 's for tne gown and cap I want it. Think what éclat it would
have given me! Think what an advertisement it would have been for
me to have figured in University costume on the walls of next year's
Academy! I can see myself. The get-up is superb! Tell me, is
there nothing to be done," he continues, clutching eagerly at the
Warden's sleeve as he speaks, "that will help me to the immediate
assumption of some Academical costume P Could I matriculate as a
Postmaster, a Proctor, a Bull-dog,—anything? Forgive me if I am
a little mixed, but your University terms are as yet fresh and
unfamiliar to me."
The Warden grives a low prolonged whistle. "So, so ¡—that is it,
is it 'i" he replies. And then a not unkindly smile passes over his
face. "Have you ever," he asks, "composed a comic song?"
"No; but I could try," replies the Tragedian.
"For I was thinking,"
continues the Warden, " that
perhaps, if everything else
failed, we might manage to
make you a Doctor of Music."
"And the costume P"
breathlessly inquires his in-
terrogator.
"Quite magnificent," re-
plies the other, "pink and
crimson silk. You wouldn't
know yourself, well folded
across the front, you could
pass for a Doge anywhere!"
The Tragedian seizes his
hand. "Thanks, thanks,—
a thousand thanks I " he
cries effusively, and then a
crowd of admirers closing
round them. I couldn't catch
any more of the talk which
left me. I confess, somewhat
in doubt as to its upshot.
The matter, however, was
cleared np at an afternoon
luncheon and garden-party,
on the following Wednesday,
where I heard the Public
Orator describing to the

conversation at the previous soirée ; but I reflected, "perhaps they '11
give him a turn at something better another year."
COMPARING NOTES.
MADAME LIEBHART'S Matinée Musicale at St. James's Hall was a
typical " benefit" concert. An enormously long programme, upon
which appeared a formidable array of fingers and players, was com-
menced at 2'30. But, as usual at these overgrown affairs; many of
the artists who gave their services either did not arrive m time to
come on in their proper turn, or else were dissatisfied with the place
allotted to them on the programme. Anyhow, the latter was so far
"subject to alteration "as to be of little practical utility; and in
certain instances the disagreeable impression was unavoidably con-
veyed that an engagement entered upon to oblige a sister artist was
not considered to be so stringent, or worth keeping so punctually, as
a paid one. Mr. Punch holds the very opposite view. Though the
entertainment consisted of two Parts, it was impossible to say where
Part I. ended, as the " Blue Hungarian Band," which was set down
for its final number, played incontinently about half way through it,
and Mr. SCOVEL subsequently sang a song out of Part II., while
Mr. ISIDORE DE L AHA did not show up at all while I was present.
Such among the audience as had books of the words were largely
occupied in comparing notes" with each other, to determine, ae
they feverishly turned over the leaves, "where they were;" and
when Mr. RICCI, who had only one song to sing, and should have
sung " Israfe/i." in English, by OLIVER KINO, started off in Italian,
many of us felt hurt. The bulk of the programme was, however,
gone through, if somewhat capriciously, and some of the most pitiful
samples of the contemporary ballad were rehearsed with all the
fatuous complacency of the vocalist who does not apparently perceive
that he or she is degrading music and the English language at the
same time. That an artist like Madame ANTOINETTE STERLING
(who, to do her justice, was "up to time") should feel justified in
coming forward with such a thing as " Children Asleep," wherein a
poverty-stricken and slip-shod setting fittingly conveys the rancid
ooze of a crazy sentiment in the words, is only less surprising than
that a man who has taken the degree of Doctor—whether of Medicine
or Music—should be capable of writing " The Lore Tryst" ascribed
to Dr. R. WOÖAN MACDONNELL, and sung by Mr. SCOVEL. It is
difficult to say whether words or tune are feeblest. "The Little
Hero," too, composed and sung by Mr. MAYBRICK, is a masterpiece
of pathetic futility. This bright work contains four verses of sixteen
lines each, and necessitates in performance something of the fluency
involved in a successful recital of " Peter Piper picked."
Among the redeeming features of a Concert which must have been
sorely harassing to the giver of it—(just fancy standing in the
artists' room while the last notes of a piece are being played, and
wondering whether the performer you have been depending on has
forgotten the day !)—must be mentioned Madame I.IKBHART'S own
rendering of "/ Dreamt that I dwelt," mid tin "Chanson
d'Amour," sung by Mile. МАШЕ DE LIDO. This number, from the
pen of M. HOLLMAN, who himself played the violoncello obbligato, is
instinct with originality and charm. His rare refinement and cor-
rectness of intonation were also heard with pleasure in two solos for
the instrument of which he is one of the best players in London. He
seems to have a peculiar faculty of selecting taking but good and
effective music, and his performance on this occasion—particularly of
a " Valse lente" by RAOUL PUGNO—was characterised by his usual
artistic excellence.
M. EUGENE OUDIN deserves especial praise for his good delivery of
two songs by KTEHULF. But the music would not have enhanced the
reputation of a SMITH. Miss FANNY DAVTES played carefully, unos-
tentatiously, and beautifully, on the piano, a prelude in A flat, by
CHOPIN, and a very difficult gigue. The " Blue Hungarian Band"
are a queer folk. Very "jumpy" was the piece I heard them in.
No name vouchsafed. They got very slow indeed at times, and then
fiddled away for their very lives. This is in the Hungarian " taste."
NiBELmiGLKT.
THE POLITE POLICEMAN.
A CORRESPONDENT who signs himself "VINDEX," and complains
bitterly of his treatment by the Force, alleging that he has twice
quite lately been knocked down and trampled on at a crossing, told
to get inside his horse, and been several times taken into custody for
threatening to give evidence hostile to a Constable in a street row,
writes to say that, as he hears that Sir CHARLES WARREN is about to
look into the whole question, and deal effectively with the " morals
and manners " of the Police, he has a few preliminary suggestions to
offer as to their proper drill and training to this end. Passing over
the fact that he would have their "domestic antecedents" in-
quired into before allowing them to enlist in the Force, so that none
but men of "genial, equable, amiable, and philanthropic tempera-
ment" should be admitted, he begins by insisting, to insure a proper
polish being given to this rough material, that it should be in-
cumbent on all fresh recruits to go through a course of deportment
and dancing, and pass an examination in the smaller amenities of
social etiquette. For the latter he supplies a brief specimen paper,
which is as follows :—
1. "When a crowd is creating a block on the pavement, and you are
anxious to make it circulate, what polite phrase would yon use
instead of the customary and brutal, "Now then, move on "?
2. If jeered at for your efforts, which prove ineffective, and your
helmet is knocked off your head from oehind, with what good-
humoured banter would vou naturally reply?
3. On meeting with a drunk and incapable case, it is your duty to
endeavour not to lock it up, but to see it safely home. Calling a
four-wheeled cab for this purpose, are you justified, if you have to
~iay it, in endeavouring to recover the fare, or should you willingly
.efray the expense from your own pocket?
4. Coming up with a burglar, you explain to him gently, that per-
haps, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, you ought to
take him into custody, when he seizes your truncheon, and suddenly
knocks you down. Ought you to get up and endeavour to pursue
him, or generously give him the chance of a fresh start?
5. An omnibus runs into a private carriage, and all three horses
are down with the proprietors sitting on their respective heads. If.
when you intervene, you are told, "just to mind your own business,"
ought you, bowing politely to the crowd, to say, "Well, Gentlemen,
—as you will," and quietly resume your beat?
A good deal more follows, and the'directions for drill, include, "the
elegant handing of ladies over crowded crossings," the "escorting
and holding open umbrellas over them in the rain," the "pleasant
way of dealing with unmuzzled dogs," and "the singing of sweet
ditties after dark in suburban neighbourhoods," all of which accom-
plishments, are to be left in the hands of thoroughly instructed, and
well qualified Inspectors. Indeed the scheme is very complete, and
could scarcely fail if carried out, not only to relieve the Force of the
charge of churlishness that has lately attached to it, but to invest it
at the same time with a thorough bonhomie and good breeding that
would soon grow proverbial and render the words "Police" and
"Politeness, nothing more or less than convertible terms.
Lint on v. Robinson.
IF one fact is worth a thousand argumente, one hundred and
sixty-eight facts must be worth so many arguments that we have
lot time to work it out. All these facts are assembled at the Royal
institute of Painters in Water-Colours by Sir JAMES ¿INTO», and
;hey—we forgot to say the facts are water-colour drawings of the
lighest class, and most of them of venerable age—effectually and
finally prove that water-colours are permanent. Anyone oan see at
a glance—before you can say J. C. ROBINSON—that water-colours do
iot fade. So
J. C. ROBINSON, he
Must acknowledge his notions are fiddlededee!
Let it be clearly understood there are to be no further arguments
on the matter. Sir JAMES LTHTON has proved his case. Judge
Punch has given a verdict in his favour, and so every one else may
shut up, and take a back seat. Hooray!

A DISGUSTED C. C.
MR. PÜXCH. SIB,
I Alt literally boiling over with indignation at the amount of
roasting I am receiving, from the members of my numerous acquain-
tance, as to the state of my health after my imagined week of
Festivities. Week of Festivities indeed I Week of Fasting rather.
The stewing and baking and frying, being confined to the heat of the
one festivity, to which I was invited.
On Sunday I went to Church, to St. Paul's, no refreshments there
of course, and none expected. On Monday I gazed with a proper
degree of profound respect, and at a respectful distance, upon the
Masonic performance of H.H.H. the Prince of WALES, at the Tower
Bridge. No refreshments afterwards, tho' certainly not of course,
for I certainly did expect them. On Tuesday I was not included in
the select few who dined at the Mansion House, with the Mayors and
Provosts of the United Kingdom. On Wednesday, I was informed,
that the grand reception and supper at the Colinderies, was adjourned
sine die. On Thursday I went to the Crystal Palace at the invita-
tion of the Directors of that real Palace of the People, but as my
refreshments were at my own expense, they were confined to a cup of
coffee and a roll and butter. On Friday I attended the magnificent
ball that we gave at Guildhall, and then of course I was enabled to
voi. xci.
indulge my remarkably fine appetite, with every luxury that a
refined taste and immense experience could supply. On Saturday I
was not invited to meet the Prince of WALES, at a grand banquet to
the Executive Committee of the Colinderies, of which I had heard a
distant rumour.
So you will perceive, Sir, that my share of the famous week's
festivities, amounted to one good supper, provided for me by the
Corporation, and a cup of coffee and a roll and butter, provided for
me by myself. And yet I find that 1 am the victim of the pretended
sympathy of my pitying friends, at my necessarily seedy appearance
after a week of unbounded luxury. The trial is doubly hard to bear,
as it began with bitter disappointment, and ends with sardonic
sympathy. A c c (ÍM¿ ^^^у ^t a Seedy One).

A KEGULAB PLANT.
SIB,—Here is a passage from a book I have been reading, " The
Sagacity and Morality'af Plants, by J. E. TATLOB, Ph. D., F.L.S.,
&o., Ac.: CHATIO AND WDTDUS," that has afforded me not only some
food for reflection, but material for experiment. "Hosts of common
plants," the author says, "con-
tinually perform actions which,
if they were done by human
beings, would at once be brought
within the category of right and
wrong. There is nardly a vice
or virtue which has not its
counterpart in the action of the ...
vegetable kingdom." -~=-|j"
I soon set about getting a 4.7*•
E radical answer to his question 't'J
y pi anting my back garden and , , _ ,., „ . „
stocking my conservatory with <<An Orchld Hunter'
selected specimens, and then watching and taking notes. The result
has been so unique and peculiar that I publish it without further
apology. Here it is :—
Taking my round this morning, was much surprised by hearing
peals of laughter. Found that they came from a Brassica hilaris, or
light-hearted Cabbage (native of Putney), that had apparently been
sent into fits by some remarks of the Napina hieroglyphica, or
conundrum-asking Turnip. Noticed at the same time the unappre-
oiative attitude of a fine sample of Cucúrbita deridens, one of the
Sneering Pumpkin family, whose tone was very irritating to some
Asparagus that had evidently enjoyed the joke. Saw, as I came up
the path, a Raphanus flebilis, or easily-moved Horse-Radish, weep-
ing in sympathy with an Onion that was.also in tears, but I couldn't
make out exactly what they were crying about, unless it was the
conduct of a row of Strawberries, that resented being planted in their
immediate vicinity, and deliberately turned their backs on them. On
approaching the house found that the Creeper, a House-Breaking
Wisteria, Wisteria fur ax, (native of Seven Dials), had in the night
got in at the staircase-window, and managed to carry off a couple of
bottles of pale ale from a cupboard on the landing. These I dis-
covered it had given to a Begonia siticulosa, one of the dram-drinking
species, that had been left out in its pot at the foot of the garden-
steps, and had been egging on the Wisteria to commit the theft.
On entering the conservatory, was at once reminded of the Pelar-
gonium jocosum, or practical joking geranium, that had again
been up to its tricks, this time making a booby-trap of the watering
pot, and hiding the contents of the work-basket among the roots oí
the ferns. I was, however, assisted in discovering their whereabouts
by a total-abstaining cactus ( Cactus abstinens), that takes a serious
view of life, and fortunately frequently acts as a wet blanket to the
exuberant tomfoolery set on foot by the roystering annuals.
Noticed that several pots of Lobelia had been beaten literally from
blue to black in aggressive attacks made on them by a hardy speci-
men of the Prize-fighting Fuchsia (Fuchsia betticosa), which. I,
however, managed eventually to quiet down by threatening to plant
it out among the artichokes. Couldn't help observing the nasty
feeling that appeared to exist between a Gardenia and several pots
of Mignonette, the latter being restrained from flying at the former
only by the presence of a hypochondriacal Phlox (Phlox melancholicus),
native of Herne Bay, whose proverbial ill-humour and depression
seemed to act as a salutary check upon any attempt to make a
demonstration. Finished my round by turning out a low-minded
Hollyhock that had taken to using tile bad language of flowers and
threatening a Dahlia, that had made away with the clipping-scissors,
that I would call in the police unless it gave them up.
Such, Sir, has been my experience, which I beg you will publish
for what it is worth, as I believe it will throw a good deal of prac-
tical light upon Dr. TAYLOB'S theories. For Mfinw reasons I
suppress my name and address, and must ask you to permit me
simply to subscribe myself, SOMETHUÎO LUE A GAKDKTEB.

(From ne "Tm-s.'"*
THEHE cannot be two opinions as to what the result of a" Gladstonian victory
would be. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that in that case the total sub-
version and dislocation of all moral and material ties, which would infallibly
ensue, would not produce physical consequences of a similar portentous mag-
nitude,—assuming, in a word, that the world would still go round, we have next
to consider in what state it would go round. Here, in England, the stars would
look down on a ruined Empire and a shattered Constitution! Our Colonies,
despising a connection with an effete political Organism, would at onue cast us
adrift, and the great glory and boast of all Englishmen would have disap-
peared. Mr. GLADSTONE, it is needless to say, would be absolute Dictator,
and, before a year had elapsed, we should see our ancient Church destroyed,
the House of Lords abolished, Buckingham Palace let out in flats to the work-
ing-classes, an equestrian statue of Mr. BBADLAUGH surmounting the Arch
at the top of Constitution Hill, Lord SALISBURY beheaded on Shepherd's Bosh
Green, and the National Gallery actually thrown open to a profane crew of
sightseers for one hour on alternate Sundays! Shall we reduce our sister
island to the status of a mere Colony—although, of course, our Colonies are,
as we have said before, the pride and mainstay of the Empire P
Under such a regime, emigration to some autocratically-governed country
would be the only resource left, and we ourselves should certainly settle in the
densest and most savage parts of the African jungle, if the break-up of the
Empire was not sure to offer an unprecedented opening for sensational hysterics;
—an opportunity which, from a patriotic point of view, would, of course, be
most deplorable, but which, at the same time, journalistically considered, would
pay exceptionally well.
(From the "D-ly N-ws.")
THEBE cannot be two opinions that a Gladstonian defeat at the Elections
would utterly upset the equilibrium of the Universe. Such an event would
show that English voters did not care twopence for Justice, Truth, Generosity,
Patriotism, and all the rest of the Virtues, and that their spirit altogether
failed to throb within thorn in response to the "magnanimity of Mr. Тш HEALY,
the more than Ciceronian eloquence of Mr. SEXTON, and
the kindly patronage of Mr. PARNEU,. We should carry
on a miserable existence in a kingdom divided against
itself, and in a hopelessly shattered Empire. Lord
SALISIH:HY, we need hardly add, would be so entirely
master of the situation, that within twelve months the
British Fleet, cooperating with a million Orangemen
armed to the teeth, would nave laid Dublin in ashes, the
whole of the present Irish Parliamentary Party would
have been shipped off to St. Helena, Mr. GLADSTONE—
with Sir ANDKEW CLABK as his only attendant—would
be chained in a cellar in Lord RANDOLPH Сшгаснпх'в
town-house, trade would have ceased, commerce perished,
and " our old nobility " would alone be left, to pby lawn-
tennis and hold garden-parties on the site where onoe
stood the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England. It
is indeed a solemn thought that all these consequences
may be brought about by putting a cross in the wrong
place on a voting paper! Vet truth is sometimes stranger
than fiction, and it will, we believe, also prove far stronger
than faction.
A REGATTA RHYME.

I LIKE, it is true, in a basswood canoe
To lounge, with a weed incandescent:
To paddle about, there is not a doubt,
I find is uncommonly pleasant!

To see pretty toilettes and faces;
But one thing I hate—allow me to state—
The fuss they make over the Races!
/ don't care a rap for the Race».'—
Mid all the Regatta embrace»—
I'm that tort of chap, I don't care a rap,
Л rap or a snap for the Races!
I don't care, you know, a bit how they row,
Nor mind about smartness of feather;
If steering is bad, I 'm not at all sad,
Nor care if they all swing together!
Oh why do they shout and make such a rout,
When one boat another one chases?
'Tis really too hot to bawl, is it not?
Or bore oneself over the Races!
I clon't care a rap for the Races, $c., $c.
Then the Umpire's boat a nuisance we vote,
It interrupts calm contemplation;
Its discordant tone, and horrid steam moan,
Is death to serene meditation!
The roar of the crowd should not be allowed;
The gun with its fierce fulmination,
Abolish it, pray—'tis fatal, they say,
To pleasant and quiet flirtation!
I don't care a rap for the Races, &-c., $c.
If athletes must pant—I don't say they shan't—
But give them some decent employment;
And let it be clear, they don't interfere
With other folks' quiet enjoyment!
When luncheon you re o'er, 'tis really a bore—
And I think it a very hard case is—
To have to look up, from pâté or cup,
And gaze on those tiresome Races!
I don't care a rap for the Races, $c., 4rc.
The Races, to me, seem to strike a wrong key,
Mid dreamy delightful diversion;
There isn't much fun seeing men in the sun,
Who suffer from over-exertion!
In sweet idle days, when all love to laze,
Such violent work a disgrace is!
Let 's hope we shall see, with me they '11 agree,
And next year abolish the Races!
I don't care a rap for the Races, $c., $-c.
THE School Board of London have passed a resolution
calculated to make it generally known that children will
not be refused admission to Board Schools on the ground
of their being barefooted. This is of course quite right,
as the Board is naturally entirely in its element in
dealing with all cases of defective understanding.

more confused than ever about my vote. I certainly partly agree
with HABTLNGTON, and can't help being carried away with the
thorough "go" of RANDOLPH CHURCHILL, but at the same time
there 's GLADSTONES letter, and MOKLKY'S speech, a good deal of
which strikes me as unanswerable. I wish the papers were not
quite so full of election addresses, for really, in trying to read them
all, one gets quite.muddled. However, no occasion to come to any
decision to-day. I've got the week before me, and can take my
time. Besides, GLADSTONE speaks to-night, and I shall see what he
has to вау to-morrow morning. Don't fancy, though, his flavour
will quite suit my taste. Can't say, at present, I see the necessity

Quite magnificent. Could see the audience, breathlessly listening

sight. There's not a doubt of it his passionate cry to his fellow-
countrymen to do justice to Ireland rings true. Yes, I 'm quite
sure of it, Home Rule, without any reserve, is the correct thing.
I 've never had any great doubts about it, but now my mind is quite
made up. I shall vote straight for the G. О. М.
Wednesday.—A good deal unsettled by reading SALISBURY'S last
night's speech. The question is, of course, how far can one trust
him. If, for instance, what he says about Ulster is really true, I
confess it very much alters one's view of matters. Then, again, he
lays he doesn't mean " coercion " at all. Just the enforcing the ordi-
nary law of the land. Of course, if that is all, that 's right enough.
But then, why offer to repeal the ordinary law after twenty years?
Muddle here. I wonder whether the G. O. M. is really playing the
game of dismemberment of the Empire, as SALISBURY tries to make
out. Can't believe he is; stiU, he puts the matter very strongly. Must
turn it over in my mind a bit. Shouldn't like to go and give my
vote the wrong way, after all. Ton my word, it 'e very contusing.
Thursday,—Thank goodness, I 've read MORLEY'S speech, and also
PABHELL'S. Quite made up my mind again. Nothing could be
more outspoken or convincing than MOUI.EY, and I go with him
entirely in everything he says; while there 's an honest ring about
PARNELL'S utterances that is unmistakable. He scoffs at the
thought of the Ulster mischief, and he is evidently quite right, and

Friday,—Have been reading BRIGHT'S speech, five columns of it,
and am bound to say my yesterday's views have been a good deal
affected by it. "Old JOHN BRMHT," can't be suspected ofplaying a
Tory game, and here he is dead against the Government. Has set me
thinking, and I 've been looking into Irish History, but I can't make
much of it. Certainly I agree with him, that we ought not to try a
gigantic experiment of this sort, just to please 3,000,000 out of
36,000,000, and he argues that it wffl be a dead failure as well. I
wonder whether he really means what he says. Suppose he does.
Very awkward, this continued "up and down" sort of feeling.
How I do wish the voting was over! I 've Wlf a mind to toss for it,
which way I go. Bothered if I can make out which way it will be.
Saturday.—Been at the papers all the morning, reading addresses
pro and con. Home Rule, and have been more confused than ever,
but a couple of letters of the Grand Old Man, have somewhat cleared
the atmosphere for me, and I think now on the whole, I can't do
wrong in giving him my vote. Still I can't quite make up my mind,
and on my way to the polling booth, I stop and read an opposition
manifesto, which again rather opens the floodgates of doubt, as to
whether I shall be really doing the right thing. Have both candi-
dates' cards in my pocket. Wish I could come to a final decision,
which to vote for. Don't see what else I can do, but get out a half-
penny and toss for it. Do it. Heads, GLADSTONE. Heads it is.
Best out of three. Toss again. Tails this time,—that's SALISBURY.
Now to decide. Here goes. Heads, by Jove! So the G. О. М. wins.
Register my vote for him, and loiter home with a clear conscience.

SUCH A COMIC OPERA!
"Let ив Be-atty together."—Otó Sony. Music by Herví.
ON Tuesday the 29th of June, Frivoli, humorously described as a
"Comic Opera," was produced at Drury Lane. On such a night,
when the heat was oppressive, Frivoli was welcome as a gentle frost.
Without much call upon my imagination, I can suppose such a scene
as this between Messrs. RABBIS and HEBTE :—
Hervé. I should like much to produce my opera, Frieoli, at Drury
Lane.
[Thinks to himself that he would be very glad to get a cliancefor
it somewhere in England.
Harris. Ah—yes—Frivoh. Yes—ah—what 's it about?
[Thinks aside that, whatever it is, on certain terms it might fill
Ж the interval between Гл к i, ROSA'S departure and the next
nsation Drama, and might give him an opportunity of
securing some of his people who would be wanted for the
Drama and the Christmas Pantomime.
Hervé. Very characteristic: great opportunity for costume, for
scene, for tout ce qu'il y a de plus beau. There is no Manager in the
world who can put a piece on the stage as you. Ah no! it is true.
Ant) what theatre !—Drury Lane, for spectacle! Superb!
Harris. Yes; we do everything rather well at The Lane. I flatter
myself. No cheese-paring, no old scenery and dresses. No; we '11
do it for you to-rights, my boy—that is, you understand me, if we
do do it. What 's the costume? I don't want any classics, or Wagner
style, no Tannhäuser and armour.
Hervé. But no. There is not of that. Voyons.' It is Duo,
Duohesse
Harris. Oh, I know—Louis Quatorze or Louis Quinze costume.
Not very new, but effective. Big chorus?
Hervé (thinking thnt (his is a detail which he can arrange when
he once gets it on the stage]. Not great. The Opéra Comique chorus
as ordinaire. Some pretty girls
Harris. Yes, yes—I know—Pages, Courtiers, Noblemen, Ladies of
the Court, a few soubrettes. Now, as to terms? (These having been
arranged to their mutual satisfaction, the dialogue proceeds.) Good.
Well, you know I 've not heard a note of it as yet. KINGSTON has
done the lyrics, eh? I '11 put it on the stage, and if there are only a
few lively " goey" airs—— Let's see, you wrote Chilpéric, Little
Faust, IS Œil Crevé, didn't you?
Hervé (pleased). Perfectïy. (Then conscientiously remembering
that he has tried to to get away from his old form in this new work.)
But this is not an Opéra bouffe. It is Comic Opera.
Harris. Ah, well, I don't care what you call it. as long as it is
comic, with plenty of tuney tune in it. The public like tune, my boy.
Hervé. And who can you give me for to sing?
Harris. Oh, that's all right. (Thinks over a few names in
"Human Nature.") There 's HABBT NICHOLLS—he 's a deuced fine
tenor, when he likes.
Hervé. Ah! ABRÉ NEEKOL. I do not know him, but I will take
your word.
Harris (thoughtfully—with a view to a Company for next Drama).
Then there 's PATEMAN. I can get PATEMAN, if 1 try. He '11 come.
Hervé. What voice has PATEMAN?
Harris. Voice? Oh, sings everything—anything, chiefly baritone
though, and not bad in a chorus.
Herré. And the women P
Harris (enthusiastically). My dear Sir, got the pick of London for
you. Only got to say whom you'11 have, and there she is. (" Thinks
of a number—adds ten to it." Then it suddenly occurs to him that
KOSE HERSEE has been frequently mentioned to him. Determines to
try it. Good name, "ROSE.") ROSE HEBSEE'S disengaged,—do
first-rate for you. What 's the neroine P
Hervé (a trifle uncertain). Well—the prima donna would be Rosella.
Harris (as if grasping the whole plot intuitively). Just the part for
ROSE HEBSEE. By the way, where 's the scene laid? At Frivoli, of
course, eh P Fête in the Gardens of Frivoli! I see. (Beaming in
view of a grand effect with lanterns and КАТИ LANNER.) Frivoli, a
sort of Tivoli, I know. I can make it grand.
Hervé (checkitig his impetuosity). Mais non—vous vous trompez.
Frivoli is the chief part—a singer.
Harris (disgusted). A singer! Dash it! I thought it was tea-
gardens. Well, all right—(reconciles himself to the fact)—fire away.
What sort of a part is Frivoli f
Hervé (enthusiastically). Oh, bright, bright! A sort of—(is about
to say " Troubadour," but recollects the recent operatic production of
that name just in time to stop himself and substitute)—Wandering
Minstrel—gay—beaucoupde chic—espèce de Cherubino
Harris Ah—a boy P That is, I mean, to be played by a woman P
Hervé. Perfectly, by a woman! (Trying to inspire AUGUSTUS
with his own enthusiasm.) Piquante! pétulante!! ravissante!!!
Harris (pretending to catch the inspiration). The very one—just
mentioned her! (Slaps him on the shoulder.) ROSE HEBSEE, my boy!
Do it, and look it, down to the ground. She 's an all round actress.

So I should imagine the cast was gradually settled, and with the
results that a considerable burden is laid on those gifted vocalists,
Messrs. HABBT NICHOLLS and PATEMAN,—but a greater burden is laid
on the audience. There are Counts and Duchesses and soubrettes and
soldiers, and a
little piping
bullfinch of a
troubadour call-
ed Frivoli. But
what the plot is
I haven't got
the vaguest idea,
beyond that the
stout little Fri-
voli throws a
letter on to a
wrong balcony,
and, on the prin-
ciple of "put a
penny in, and
the figure will
work, — brings
out Mr. HABBY
NICHOLLS in a
night - cap and
dressing - gown.
The time of the т.
action is Louis Herré composes, Drunolanus disposes.
Quinze, and the dialogue is of the present Music Hall topical kind,
patented on the stage by that amusing wag Mr. ABTHUB ROBERTS,—
admissible in burlesque and Opéra bouffe which is much the same
thing, but not in Comic Opera, of which the Marriage of Figaro and
Sorber of Seville, are the standard.
Miss MONROE arrived late—not until the Second Act—and wouldn't
have been there then, if she hadn't come on horseback. What the
point of this was, Heaven, 111 ; u v ft, and HABBIS only know. Miss
SOLDENE seemed to be in pain when she sang ; and I pitied her and the
eminent tenor HABBY NICHOLLINI, in their great contortionist duet.
Mr. MARGATE PIERPOINT sang nicely, and a gentleman perversely
calling himself '' S. W. GILBERT " (so like his topsy-turvy style instead
of "W. S. GILBEBT," and taking us all by surprise, while Автнив
SULLIVAN is hard at work at his new Cantata) proved himself to be
possessed of a very sweet voice and correct style.
The one thoroughly hearty encore—and this scored a treble,
perhaps as a kind of protest against the rest of the Opera, and
to show M. 11 UK v i the sort of thing the English public do like, and
do expect from him,—was for a chorus of Austrian soldiers with
plenty of action and a thundering lot of drum, a good show of girls,
and a dance by KATTI LANNER'я pupils,—who seem, under her system,
to _ have been
trained up into
womanhood since
last Christmas.
This chorus,
march past, and
dance were
nearer to M.
HERVI'S old
Chilpéric-L'Œil
Crevé form than
anything I heard
the whole even-
ing; but I admit
I came away in
the middle oi the
Third Act, and
perhaps all that
was worth hear-
ing was given
after I had re-
tired.
Mr. PATEMAN,
apparently had
The Hovering Cook and the "Good All Bound" Minstrel, a míe part during
who ought to sing, "Hover! of thee I'm fondly dreaming." y^ above-men-
tioned chorus. It was chiefly in action, but I fancy he was speaking,
and probably saying any number of good lines which would be
unfortunately lost to the audience, on account of the vigorous
conduct of the drummers, who were thoroughly enjoying themselves.
One of the sentimental—I believe it was intended to be sentimental
—songs, is worth immortalising in an illustration; it was sung by the
airy-tairy Frivoli, and its refrain was—
Happy Thought! If I could
Catch a glimpse of the cook
At she hovers the kitchen around! &e., &c. (See Illtutratton.)
After the Second Act I came to the conclusion that a grave mistake

had been made in the oast. Frivuli is a low comedian's part, and, iJ
neither Mr. WM. HILL nor Mr. RIQHTON could have been engaged, it
ought to have been played by HABET Nicnor.i.s, while Miss HOSE
H EKSK E could have taken one of the numerous heroines, of whom there
seemed to be a lot about ; and to distinguish her from the others, she
could have executed the peculiar '' j odel " for which she is famous, and
which isi so much better when unchecked by the band's accompaniment.
With this alteration, with PATEMAN as the t)uc,—without a song or duet
(and why couldn't he be a bachelor ?)—with most of the music omitted,
except the soldiers' chorus and ballet, and some from Chilpertc, &o.,
substituted for what it might be proposed to leave in, with the best
of the Be-attyfied Lyrics retained, but all the dialogue removed
bodily, and Mr. NICHOLLS left to his own invention, aided by a few
suggestions from Messrs. РЕТТГГГ and HARRIS, and then the mite-en-
scene by AUGUSTUS DBUBIOLANUS being admirable throughout, the
last Act might finish with an eruption of Mount Vesuvius, (now only
seen mildly blazing in the distance) _ which should involve the
characters in one common ruin, and bring down the curtain to the
satisfaction of everybody. This might draw the Town, or what is
lef tjof it, until the production of the new Drama, by AUGUSTUS MAGNUS
and HEXRICUS PAKVUS, is ready,—and let us hope that this date is not
far off. Wishing that their previous success may be " continued in
their next," I am everybody's Candid Friend, NIBBS.

water they made up in loyalty, witch literally blazed out all over
the pine«, from the bold assertion at the principal Pub, that HEB
MAJESTY had earned all Heggum's love for hart a sentry, down to
the little oullered pocket handkerchief hanging out of a garret
winder, on witch was painted "We welcomes our QUEEN!"
Ah! and wot Heggum said Heggum meant, and I don't think as any
owlina; demmygog as gos about a denownoing of all the greatest hin-
btitusmms of theland, grand old copperashuns and all, woud ha had
a werry agréable time of it if he 'd have atempted to lectur at Heggum
about 5 a clock, pea, hem, on Wensday larst, and long be the day
when he can! There was a werry conwenient Hoss Pond close bye.
Being a remarkabel fine day, I warked from the Station to the Skool,
witch I was told wasn't a mue off, no more it wasn't, for it was jest
about too. Oh these little country jokes, how they seems to be car-
ried down for long long ears 1 Wen I at length reached the Skool, I

coud ardly help thinking as I was a being played another joke weu
I was told to enter a Lively Pallia. But so it was, and to my mind,
small tho' that mind may he, I says without not no dowt, nor no hez-
zitation, that it 's the werry Wehest Pallie as I ewer entered perfesh-
nally. Why there was sum parts on it as was t hat he xquisitly chizzled
as you mite ha taken it for confeokshunary, and if that isn't a com-
plement to the harkitect I don't know what IB.
I passes hover all the sherry moni al part of the bizziness, for. trewth
to tell, my long ot walk, and my long ot waiting for sumthink to do,
fairly oweroome me, and I slept the sleep of the idle waiter. I woke
up jest in time to see Mr. МАВТШ HOLLO WAY give HEB MAJESTY a
bootiful Gold Box. Happy man he looked, tho' he was rayther ot.
But weather the rapshur of that moment repaid bim for the spending
of seven underd thowsand pounds of his Mother-in-Lor's money in
bilding a gals' Skool is a probblem as I leaves to wiser eds nor mine.
It was fortnate for me, as I ad my little slumber, for the next hour
after the QUEEN left was about the ottos t and the ardest as I hever
went through. My place, unfortunately, was jest in the middle of
the burning sun—and the sun does jest shine at Heggum—and the
table allotted to me was jest about harf a quarter of a mile long.
Let any one try to fansy a freely-perspiring Waiter standing alone
behind such a table as that, with a frightfully hungry public, three
deep, a shouting for wittles and drink. Wot wood a mere common
Waiter have dun under sitch trying suckumstances? Have tried
his best, and failed miserably. Wot did I do P I carmly and quietly
handed to them nearest the table, to one a dish of sanwiohes, to
another a basket of strawberrys. to another a dish of cakes, to
another a jug of what is called Shampain cup, and a tumbler, and
in about twenty minutes arter I tried this little game my tabel was
all cleared, and I quietly announced the fact as follows,—" Ladies
and Gents, there ain't no more wittels," and they all forsook my
emtv table, and fled elsewheres.
The tabel s was all put round a square place, as they called a quod-
wrangle, I 'm sure I don't know why. BBOWW said as it was meant
as a sort of prison, where the yung iadys of the future, was to have
out their little differences, as the name signifide, but BBOWN does
romance so. There was plenty of my hold paytrons there, and sum
of my young uns. I was much emused at the trnbbel a werry fussy
old gent took, to keep all the werry best places for the habsent quire.
He tried werry hard to git one of Mr. Punch'» hone gennelmen to
leave, with all his ladys, long before it was nessyeerry, but he smiled
and sed, '' move for a mere quire, no, not for a ream f and the fussy
old gent was so estonished that he said no more. He tried the same
silly thing with the three butiful graces of Werginyourwater, and
Mr. DOEASY, the Ungarian Ambassador, but they ony looked at him
and smiled, and he wanished into the emused crowd.
I had put by jist one dish of sanwiches for myself, but while at one
hend of my long tabel, a ungry gest got over and stole it! Such is
human natur wen depraved by unger. So I looked in at the loyal
Pub, as I warked down to the station, and over a crust and a glass I
discussed the hole misterv of the day with a senserbil feller as I met
there. He told me as the skool is for the heddicating of Female
Parsons. That no man of the masculin gender, is hever to henter
the sacred bilding. There 's to be jest 250 skollards, all of 'em over
seventeen, and ony one Principle Lady to look after 'em all, poor
thing! and for them as brakes down it will be a sort of prepareatory
skool for the naybouring Sannytorium. To my shame I confesses as
I bleeved all I herd, till I found out as he was merely a penny alien er
for_ a hapenny pernal as was a trying for to gammon an hed
waiter. So I hopes for his sake as I shall never have the sattis-
Faoshun of repaying him in his own koin, in the shape of wit tels, or
the saddle of mutton may be placed on the other hone. ROBEBT.
"0 SI SIC OMNE8!"
ACTIONS at Law would indeed be delightful if they were all
conducted as pleasantly as was Field v. Labouchere last week. It
was an action for libel; but scarcely was it commenced when Sir
UKNKY JAMES, interposing, said that Mr. FIELD'S object was not to
obtain damages, but only an acknowledgment that the statement
made in Truth wasn't true. His client was a fair Field, and re-
quired no favour, that was all. Whereupon the ATTOBNEY-GENEBAL
said he quite agreed with Sir HENBY, and that his own client, the
popular senior Member for Northampton, most decidedly withdrew
he statement complained of. He did not wish to be the Favourite
against the Field, especially as the Favourite in this instance
couldn't win. Then Mr. Justice DENMAN complimented them all on
;he extremely handsome behaviour of everybody in the case, and
observed that if it were not waste of time to offer any comment of his
own, he should be inclined to sum up by saying that, though there
was a libel in Truth, yet there was no truth in the libel. A juror
vas then politely requested to withdraw. All the jurymen expressed
hemselves ready to oblige immediately. Whereupon everybody
rawed to everybody else, the fees were paid, the bells were rung, the
next case was called on, and we hope they '11 all live happily ever
afterwards.

NOVELTIES IN SONG-WORDS.
THE Russian Choir have delightful titles
for their part-songs, as for instance, " There
is my Heart, thoufine black-eyed Youth," " О
my Omlder-tree: О ту Raspberry Bush."
The last reminds us of the term of endear-
ment by which Mr. PICKWICK was supposed
to have addressed Mrs. BASDELL. Adapted
as a Russian song, the Pickwickian love-ditty
might be rendered, "О my tender Chops!
О ту sweet Tomato Sauce!" Perhaps thi»
may set a new fashion for ballad-mongers.
The series is evident according to the season,
"О ту Blooming Bacon! О ту Bonnie

the song of the spring onion. "My fair

"fell me not in carrant Numbers!" and

THE LOST LETTER-BAG.
(" Litera scrip/a manet")
PERHAPS it was the festivities of the late genial wintry Whitsuntide season that induced
the Postman to sit down in the street and play Russian Patience with the letters. Perhaps,
on the other hand, the letter-bag was stolen, after an immense expenditure of careful skill,
by Mr. WLLIAM SIKES, who supposed it to contain diamonds for the Amsterdam Market,
and who threw it away when he found that its contents were only the following epistles.
In any case the letters are unclaimed by their authors and owners, and Mr. Punch, like
another famous man of genius, "takes his own wherever he finds it, —and publishes it. In
some instances where the signatures are illegible, they have been omitted, in the hope that
the style and the matter may betray the writers, by whom, no doubt, the letters will be imme-
diately claimed.
DEAR THOMPSON, I. Bloomsbury. June 25.
THE pursuit of scientific research into Natural History, has its difficulties when the
student is compelled to reside in this Metropolis. My favourite adder lately made its escape,
and was killed by the unsympathetic cook in my neighbour's coal-cellar. This incident
has made me unpopular in the district, and my experiments as to the "homing instincts" of
the domestic Cat nave been, on the whole, rather a failure. You remember our discussion
of the remarkable anecdotes about Cats in the Spectator, and probably you have not for-
gotten the anecdote of the kitten which found its way home to Thurso from PenzanceP
With the purpose of testing the existence of the homing instinct in the Cat, I have devoted
six months to collecting, (by the use of valerian and unremitting kindness) the tome and
tabbies of the neighbourhood. All the bakers' windows here are full of advertisements
beginning, "LOST a Magnificent Persian Cat," and so forth. The animals unknown to
their proprietors, were all safe in my study: science has its rights as well as its duties. Last
week I determined to test finally the cats' boasted power of finding their way home. In
the dead of night'I chartered five four-wheelers, tilled (hem with cats of every land and race—
the tail-less Manx, the blue hairy Russian, the common puss, and so forth. I then bade
the cabmen drive to Wimbledon Common. Before I could complete these simple arrange-
ments, a large and angry crowd had collected opposite my house, and though I explained to the
policeman that I was merely engaged in a scientific experiment, my windows were broken by
the excited populace. Finally we got under
weigh, and about five in the morning we
reached Wimbledon Common. In a desert
place, (near "the fourth hole out," yon will
know it if you are a golf-player) I opened
the door of the cabs, and released the feline
fares, or rather the survivors, for a dreadful
pitched battle had been fought in each cab.
After a little skirmishing in the open, the
cats withdrew into the adjacent brushwood,
but I had considerable difficulty in satisfy-
ing the cabmen. It must be admitted that
the interiors of their vehicles had been a
good deal altered for the worse. Now, will
you believe it, despite their instinct, not
one of these cats has returned to my home,
though they all received the most distin-
guished kindness! So much for their boasted
•' Instinct!" I have ever since been perse-
cuted by the minions of the police, and am
hooted in the streets, as " The Count and
his Cats," when I take my walks abroad.
The crayfish in the cisterns are defunct.
London is no home for the naturalist.

Ballykilbrothofabiwy, Ulster, June 27.
DEAR GENERAL.
YOUR plan (in certain circumstances)
for a combined attack on Dublin and Lime-
rick, by forces descending the Liffey and
Shannon, in whalers, is to hand, and con-
tents noted.* The scheme for landing and
disposing the men, disguised as anglers,
tract distributors, and agents for patent
land-fertilisers, is excellent. But the whale-
boats? How is Transport to be arranged
for, and are you quite serious in your plan
for a Camel Brigade, the camels being har-
nessed to jaunting cyars? You say MOLTKE
says he never heard of such versatile re-
source, as is implied in this scheme of
yours, and in the Balloon Brigade of Pro-
testant Skye Blue Jackets, but menageries
are very rare in Ireland, and you wiU not
be able to make war support itself, in this
country, at least as far as recruiting animals
for the Camelry is concerned. While ac-
knowledging your esteemed favour, we
would respectfully solicit a fresh sample of
your celebrated military patterns, and
remain Faithfully yours,
P.S.—The weather has got at the Gardi-
ner guns concealed in the Dog, and they all
jam. So do the " Hymn-books," all but one
that went off by accident yesterday and
killed the pig.

style in this letter, is remarkable.

MAEY ATÍNER ON THE SKARESERTY OF HISSTTSSES.
DEAE LIZEE JANE,
THIS comes oping as you are A1, and find your new sitcher-
watiou to your mind. I am still out of coller, as the saving is, and
likely so to be if things don't alter. There 's a lot of talk jest now
of me scarserty of domestic Servants. What / complain of is the
scarserty of Missusses! By wich, my dear, I mean Missusses as a gal
of sperrit can demean erself to live with. I 've bin after no less than
fourteen siteherwations this hidentical week as ever is, and not one of
them wuth its salt, let alone being posishuns in wich a young lady of
a self-respective turn and pussonal atraotions second to few could be
appy in. Wot I want to know is who 's to compensate me for the
oonsekent loss of time and aggery vation of temper? Seven hindi-
wijal Hagencies has my name on their books, from stuck-up young
minxes of seventeen to gig-lamp'd old frumps of seventy—meaning
the lady-prinserples, my dear—and never a heligibble horfer have I
ad out of the blessed lot. And then it 's the Missusses as complains!
Ojus, isn't it?
My dear LIZEE, the sitcherwations now a-knocking about^-and evings
knows they 're as plenterful as plums in porrige or 'air-pins in a
fashernable lady's ed—aint wuth tuppence a baker's dozen, and dear
at that. And as to the Missusses, well, a bunch of dog's-meat is a
king to 'em! Missusses, indeed! My dear, will you believe as one
of 'em 'ad the impidence to object to my wearing my dimond ring to
wait at table with, and said she must really drore the line at scarlit
silk stockings to clean the steps in. She drore the line, indeed! / give
her wot for, I can promise you. And as to the places theirselves, it 's
simply 'art-breaking. Some in quiet roads, full of 'orrid laylocks
and lime-trees, with walled gardens, doorways twenty yards from
the roadway, and never a sight of a sojer or even a Salvashun Army
from week's end to week's end. Ermits' caves, my dear, is a fool to
em. Others with families of kids (I nearly made a Missus explode
the other day by eluding to her seven children as "kids ") a-kicking
about all over tne shop like, with hears for hevery bit o' gossip and
eyes for hevery follower. Not me, LIZEK! Others agin where the
Missus is a old Maid erself, and expecks all female flesh to go and
do likewise, no company but frumps with black bags and bob-curb,
not even a young man lodger or occashinil gardener to liven one up
a bit. Fancy! And others where it 's all company, gents as smoke
and talk ay anse and flosofy and stuff, with bones and stones, and
mosses and micryskopes, keeping it up till two in the morning, and

I perpose, ELIZEE JANE, my dear, to dror up a form of questions, a
sort of Missusses' Fust Cattychizem like, jest to save time and trouble,
so as one can get the Missus to fill it up and sine it. like Inkum Tacks
or Juries, before one bothers oneself further. Then, my dear, you
could see 'ow the land lay, and in case of Quite Streets, or Children,
or Old Maids, or Caps, or no Young Men, or Cold Meat, or Floeofers,
or Attic-bedrooms, or Black Beedles, or Babies, or Objecshuns to
Jewlliery, or Washin, or Too |Much Compny, or None at All, or
Early Hours, or Late Ones, or Waksed Floors, or Son learning the
Fiddle, or Teatotallism, 'or Tracks, or Tind Meats, or not enough
Holidays, or too much Kitchen-Sneaking, or No FoUerers, or less
than Thirty Pound a year to begin with, or other insoopenble hob-
iecshons, one could jest give it the Turn-up at onst without the ojue
hordeal of dancing attendance on the Missusses, and putting of 'em
through their facings wyver wosy, as the sayin is.
This seems to me to be a superior ideer, and one as us Domestic
Ladies shall be right down druv to in self-defence. Adwertisemens
indeed is many, but Missusses—tolerable^ Missusses is painful few.
We shall |ave to sort 'em out, by Cattykissem, before we wastes our
presione time, and spiles our sweet tempers on em in pussonal hin-
terviews. Wot do you think, ELIZEB-JAHE, my dear P Oping for
your hopinion by return'and also to hear ow you like your new sitcher-

HOME RULE ALL ROUND.
(A Pumphandle Poem. TÜNB—" Guy Fawkcs.")
Tus question for the country now is no mere choice of Ministers,
'Twixt Liberals and Conservatives, the Dexters 'gainst the Sinisters,
A party warfare waging, with designs and dodges tactical,
Within the sphere of politics, which common minds call practical.
Bow-wow-wow, &c.
Home Rule 's at most a moiety of a measure far more national,
The uppermost in every mind that 's sensible and rational;
A measure to eradicate the vice of inebriety,
By interdicting liquors to all classes of Society.
Bow-wow-wow, &o.
Needs must Home Rule for Ireland be domestic legislation,
Laid down on Father MATHEW'S lines to pacify the nation ¡
'Twould Irishmen from whiskey wean, on thin drink strictly diet
'em,
And let them have no more potheen; which possibly might quiet 'em.
Bow-wow-wow, &c.
Electors, in this crisis you 've a splendid opportunity,
For the only Cause of consequence to all of the community.
Vote for no candidate, whose line in politics a fad I call;
But poll for the Teetotaller, Conservative or Radical.
Bow-wow-wow, &c.
Home Rule the United Kingdom craves, that claim of its Alliance is
The only thing to care about—therein our sole affiance is.
None other do we want to press on Parliament's adoption;
Home Rule for every parish, Universal Local Option.
Bow-wow-wow, &c.
АРГЕЕ reading the Court Circular, Mr. CHABTREE exclaimed,
"Why, that little cad. SNOOKS, has been presented at Court!"
"Presented by ?" inquired Mrs. CANDOUR, pausing for a reply.
"Presented by—mistake, I suppose," said Mr. CBABTBEE.
THE EMPIRE WITH A LASTING PIECE.
IT is a lasting piece—that is; it lasts all the evening. How long
it will run, that 's another affair. I am speaking of The Pa/ace of
Pearl, now playing at the Empire Theatre. Though styled an
Extravaganza, it has in it far more of the real operatic element
than many productions which are boldly called Comic Operas. The
plot is slight, and the action—such as it is—uninteresting; but
the music, T>y Messrs. JAKOBOWSKI and STANISLAUS, is of an original,
elaborate, effective, and artistic order that is highly refreshing. In
the First Scene the two solos with refrains, "A Mimtrel's t'a a calling
Ai0A,"and " A Babe teas I," are positively delightful, and they are
well sung by Mr. MYBOH CALICE and Miss FANNY WENTWOBTD
respectively. The concerted number beginning " Back to the King"
is spirited and well worked-up, and, before the Third Scene, occurs a
most charming little bit of introduction by the band. Miss W ADMAN
gave a gipsy song with more tone and expression than she usually
displays; but she had thoroughly sympathetic music to sing, and
the curtain falls upon the First Act after a masterly and complete
finale that would not be out of place in Grand Opera. Mr. CHAULES
CARTTVBIOHT is entrusted with the inevitable drinking-song with
the not very novel refrain, "Fill up!" He sings gamely; but some
of the low notes it contained are not in his voice.
The Ballet music—to a ballet, by the way. in which the skirts are
divided with a vengeance—is very unusually pretty, besides being
suitable and musicianly. Perhaps the only disappointing number is
the septett " On Tiptoe" which is not on the same plane of excel-
lence. More should have been made of it by such capable writers.
It is, as it stands, too much like a Christy Minstrel chorus, first sung
loud and then soft; there should have been more independence and
variation in the parts. A great many of the songs arc omitted, as
the piece is found to be too long; but apart from any merits it may
possess as a spectacle, I consider the joint efforts of Messrs. JAKO-
BOWSKI and STANISLAUS, in the music, to be not only admirable for
the purpose, but almost incapable of improvement.

Mr. Gl-dst-ne replies—
WHAT 'a all this talk of smoke and reeking slaughter,
Of men of words embracing men of blood—
The hies across the westwara strait of water?
What does it mean, this tumid speech in flood?
Think you to call me single-hearted dreamer,
With venom'd tongue at me to rant and rave,

Will see me stern, and make my face grow grave 'i
No, not at ail! I mayn't approve their style,
But if young men will yell at me—I smile!
I called you young, but the expression's shifty,
For, though 'tis obvious you re young in thought,
In age you must be very close on fifty,
And might in manners p'raps be better taught.
Yet have you seen the stars one after one rise,
And set your harp in tune with all things free,
And, after singing your sweet songs of sunrise,
Have stooped to have this sunset yell at me!

That if you needs must yell—I only smile!

THE CITIZEN AS "CHUCKER-OUT."
MB. AUBERON HERBERT suggests the formation of " an independent
Society for the preservation of free speech and good order at public
meetings." Splendid idea—but, Mr. Punch thinks, impracticable,
like so many of Mr. AUBEBON HERBERT'S superior notions. The
pinch lies in the one word, "independent." People are virtuously
indignant at the disturbance of public meetings, when that disturb-
ance comes from " the other side." And, in the opinion of every
good party man, it always does come from the other side. That of
course is pure fudge; in this respect there is not a pin to choose
between the parties. Most public meetings are fairly orderly; the
minority of seriously disturbed ones are pretty equably divided
between the two—or more—sides. An organised Society of
"Chuekers-Out" would probably only complicate and aggravate
matters. When Mr. _ HERBERT can find plenty of men who are
honestly and actively indignant at disturbances coming from their
own party or side, he wül have material for his "independent"
Society of "physical stalwarts," and not till then. Meanwhile every
chairman, speaker, or attendant at a public meeting should, by way
of a beginning, set his face firmly against violence and obstruction
of every kind, as being, what they are, a reproach to reason, and a
disgrace to nwmhood. li he can contrive to come down upon" the
excesses of his own side especially, the greater hero and better
citizen he. The larger the number of men there are who qualify
themselves for Mr. ATJBERON HEHBEBT'S Chucker-Out Cohort, the
less will be the need for its services.
THE MAD BAMBOO.
THERE was an ancient Nobleman, a pillar of the State,
He wore the Garter ribbon, and his years were sixty-eight;
He lost an old ancestral stick, the finest ever made,
And went to buy another in the Burlington Arcade:
But, as ill-luck would have it, why, what did his Lordship do—
He absolutely went and bought—the MadjBamboo!
He walked down Piccadilly in the self-same afternoon,
"Iwas what I think the poet called the leafy month of June;
He met a noble lady there, a very ancient dame.
When deep his cheeks were crimsoned by a sudden flush of flame;
For lo! the stick from out his hqnd incontinently flew,
It knocked that ancient lady down—the Mad Bamboo!

He saw a nursemaid in the Park, just where the Row begins,
And in a little carriage she led out a brace of twins;
He always liked small children, so he stooped to kiss the pair.
When in a trice the horrid cane was waving in the air;
It came down with an awful whack, and split their heads in two.
Ah, woe is me that e'er he bought—the Mad Bamboo!
He went out to a theatre, the cane was in his hand,
And found himself belabouring the backs of all the band;
It wasn't quite the proper thing for anyone, they said,
And least of all a nobleman, to break a bandsman's head;
But that was what he straightway did. Oh, how he came to rue
He ever bought that sinful stick—the Mad Bamboo!
He sat within the House of Lords, 'mid Peers of high degree,
'Mid all the nobles in the realm was none so proud as he;
When all at once the frantic cane was whirling round their ears,
Then damaging the stately shins of Prelates and of Peers.
It beat the great Lord Chancellor till he was black and blue,
And all the House stood up and cursed—the Mad Bamboo!
It whacked his wife, it beat his bairns, until
they turned and fled,
It banged an aged relative who laid upstairs
i '' bed;
Не took it to his doctor, just to see what he 'd
propose,
It gave Sir WILLIAM JENNER then a san-
guinary nose:
In short, it raised atrocious wheels on
everyone he knew.
And even total strangers felt—that Mad Bamboo!
At last, grown quite exhausted by this Bedlamitic cane,
He breathed his last; but even then it started off again;
It danced upon the coffin-lid, maniacally spry,
And gave the undertaker's man a most funereal eye.
Take warning, then, by this my tale so terrible and true:
Be very sure you never buy—a Mad Bamboo!

DEAR CHARLIE,—Bin at it agin, mate, and slap in the thick of it, too,
Wich at ninety degrees in the coal-'ole is pooty 'ot ullaballoo.
All along of Old Collars, confound 'im! as won't take his gruel and go;
But I think we shall bosh 'im this hinnings, and then I shan't care arf a hlow.
I did ought to 'are bin down at 'Enley with JEREMY JINKS and his gal,
And canoodling about in a 'ouse-boat is wot I am nuts on, old pal;
'Stead o' wich I 've bin pasting, and posting, and 'owling 'ooray till I 'm 'orse,
For I 'm boss of our Districk Committee, and bound to cut records, in ooourse.
Beastly bore this Eleekshun, my pippin, but wot can a patriot do?
We must give them Disunionists toko, and fly the old Red, White, and Blue.
That bloomin' old man in a 'urry 'as got to 'ave one on the nob,
For mucking our Season in this way, and 'ARRY is fair on the job.
We shan't have no peace till he 's settled. I 'oped we 'd ha' done it last go,
But that Acres and Cow bizness floored us, thanks mainly to Brummagem JOE.
'Owsomever he backs us this journey, and old JOHNNY BROADBRIM hisself,
So I fancy the Woodman must own as it 's time he wos laid on the shelf.
I 'm Unionist down to my 'obnails, and Protestant all up my back,
A Paddy I 'ate wus than pizen, and as for the POPE and 'is pack,
Lor', CHARLIE, they ought to be frizzled. 'Ome Rule is the 'orridest rot,
For a country all Priests and Parnellites is bound to go promply to pot.
Won't disinte—whotsit my country, old man. not while /'m 'anging round.
I feels like them Hulster chaps, CHARLIE, I 'd chaw burning tow by the pound,
And die in no end of last ditches afore I 'd cave in to PARNELL;
Leastways so I kid 'em, dear boy, as will probably arnser as well.
'ARKY 's fair on the bile, and no error. Lor', CHARLIE, the larks we 'ave 'ad!
Take a paste-pot and brush arter dark, and jest drive the Disunionists mad
By sloppin' our bills over theirn wheresomever they stick 'em, yer know.
Our puree is the longest, yer see, so they pooty soon find it 's no go.
The ochre is with us, I tell yer, and so is the lotion, old chuck •
АД the pubs are a blazin' with Orange, which strikes me as jolly good luck.
It's precious dry bizness, is 'owling, and brings on a thundering thust,
But of all the palate-parchers, dear boy, I think postage-stamp sticking is wust.
Did six hundered larst Saturday night, it 's a lick and a stick, and a thump,
And I tell yon that when I had finished, I felt I could dry up a pump.
Polling-cards dontcher know for the Voters; won't ketch me agin on that lay,
Though six lemon-squoshes, with whiskey, ain't bad, when you don't 'ave to pay.
Well, we've carried our man, my dear CHARLIE, and given the Korkus'what for.
That '11 take the starch out of Old Collars. He nobble the masses? Oh, lor!
Wy the working-class down in our parts is agin 'im amost to a man.
Flood our market with Irish cheap labour? No fear, mate, that isn't their plan.
'Ome Rule 'ud make Ireland a 'Ades, our Member remarked, and he 's right,
When the Paddies 'ud swarm like muskeeters to England. A bloomin' fine sight!
Oh, I tell yer he worked that 'ere argyment proper, our Unionist did,
And we shan't cut our throats for dashed Cartholiok brickies, you bet arf a quid.
Lor1 bless yer, it 's all tommy rot this 'ere " brotherly" bizness. Old WEG
Thinks the working-man's instink" is with him; he '11 find that a preoi
bad egg.
Try another, old Josser! The Sawnies and Tykes may be nicked by his bosh,
But he better not try it down South, for he '11 jolly soon find it won't wosh.
Yah! Wot a old Juggins he is! JOE knows better. Not arf a bad sort
That 'ere CHAMBEHLING ain't, arter all. Oh, I tell yer it 's proper fine sport
To see 'im a-slating the Old 'Un; and as for that there Mister CAINE,
I could 'ug 'im, my boy, and no error, and stand 'im a pint o' champane.
Wy, the Korkns down 'ere used to washup 'im (we called him old Monthly Nuss,
'Cos he brought out so many young Clubs, CHARLIE), now you should 'ear how
they cuss.
They thought if there wos a 'Ome Ruler 'twos him, as hinformed 'em he sat
At the feet of Qermaliel POWER, a 'Ome Ruler all round his 'at.
Aha! CAINE has give 'em the Kibosh, and wot makes the beggars feel worse
Is to 'ear 'im fall foul of the Paddies, and talk of the power о the purse.
Fact is he 's a patriot, like RANDOLPH, and too cute a cove, / should think,
Not to know as a Cause soon gits busted, unless it is backed by the chink.
Yus, CHARLIE, the Ochre is with us; we don't mean to spend it I 'ope,
In making things snug in Onld Oireland, and 'anding her on to the POPE.
No, the People, the Peers and the Parsons for once pull together, and swear,
To 'ang on to the Union Jack, wich old WEQ and 'is shirkers would tear.
'Ang Ireland! I 'm sick on her, CHARLIE. Wy carn't she turn Protestant, hay?
Her religion is all tommy rot, and she must ha' found out it don't pay.
If she '11 jest chuck it up we can talk to her. Then we can put her all right,
For we 'd all be her backers then, SOLSBURY, CHAMBERLTNQ, SPURGEON, and
BRIGHT.
'Owsomever we 've bunnicked up GLADSTING, a barney all patriots enjoy;
Lor! I '11 stand our Committee drinks round on the day he 's kicked out, my

WASHING OUT.
(A Suggestion. )
A FAIR Correspondent, who signs herself " TUE DISTRESSED OWNER
OF A WniTK POODLE." writes to Mr. Punch and asks, Why doesn t
somebody during this hot weather start a Company for the erection
of Public Baths for Dogs? Such an institution," she continues,
"would be hailed with delight by dog-owners in every town where
branch establishments might be built," And she proceeds to point
out that " many ladies, and especially young mistresses of pet dogs
who themselves perform the weekly ablutions on those animals, would
gladly pay to have the exhausting operation done for them, if only
a proper bath, proper soap, and a man who thoroughly understood
the business were guaranteed. I can imagine," she adds, that on
Saturday mornings the waiting-room of the Public Baths lor Dogs
would soon become one of the most fashionable resorts tor Ladies
with dogs of all descriptions, from the stolid mastiff with which some
eirls stalk about, looking like a living Una and the Lion, to the little
white poodle, who, of all animals, I think needs the most strenuous—
and in this weather almost impossible—efforts in the way of scrubbing
and drying, and combing and brushing, before he can be converted
from the disreputable sweep he gets by Friday night, into the lovely,
glistening, white puff-ball he ought to appear on Sunday.
No doubt Mr. Punch's Correspondent has hit on a very good idea.
and he really sees no reason why some enterprising capitalist should
not take the matter in hand. It ought not to be difficult to provide
the proper soap, or the man who thoroughly understands the business
of scrubbing, combing, and even bnishmg the largest-si^ed and
most stolid-looking mastiff. Indeed, as this creature, together with
many of his larger brethren, is often washed at home under ua-
toward circumstances, frequently escaping m the middle ol the
operation all over soap, and ultimately drying himself on the
drawing-room furniture, anything like professional attendance out
of the house would be surely hailed by his owners. Were the insti-
tution once installed, improvement* would soon follow,
management might undertake the collection of the dirty dogs, and
forward them, clean and properly "got up," to their respective
residences, like the week's washing. The tariff of charges might
depend in some measure, on the character of the dogs themselves,
aTractious and snappy creature, who resented soap and water tern,
set down, of course, at a higher rate.. On the whole theideaot
Public Baths for Dogs seems promising, and Mr. Punch trusts
that in giving it publicity, he may induce somebody to take it up,
and that his Correspondent who possesses a white poodle may not
much longer have to subscribe herself its "distressed owner.
The following comes, under the heading "Apiary," from the
columns of the Bazaar.—" Ligurian or English swarms ready.
Needful articles offered for tall men's trousers." 4V hat articles can
these be У Is it a set of chain armour? } et, what special service
would that be in the case of tall men s trousers ( burely the
"needful articles" must be leggings, to meet the trousers that are
probably too short for the tall man and so prevent the invasion of
t he "Ligurian and English swarms," that are said to be ready.
'' Needful articles!" The whole subj ect is fraught with pain and mystery.
The Governors of Christ's Hospital are advertising for a Warden,
and it is to be supposed that they will get the man they want,
afthough at first bluTit does not look as if it would be a very easy
matter, "The qualifications," says the advertisement, required of
each candidate, are that he be a married man, between thirty and
forty-five years of age, and a member of the Church of England, of
supeVior education, a' good correspondent and with experience
specially calculated to fit him for the duties of discipline and super-
intendence out of school hours of 700 boys, besides the general over-
sight of a considerable number of subordinate officers." It proceeds,
"the duties of the Warden extend to Sundays, as well as to week-
days,'' and then as if struck with the idea of "all work and no
play" it adds as a saving clause, "with some relaxation at the
vacations," but then finishes up, as if on second thoughts it meant to
get as much out of the Reverend Candidate as possible, that any
gentleman taking the office, must consider his whole time as engaged
^y the Governors" As the salary is only £350, with a residence m
thVHospital, and as apparently tne office is held subject to re-election
merely from jear to year, one would not consider that a very d

set would be made at the Governors to fill
it. However, it is to be presumed that
competition is stiff in the City as everywhere
else, and that some poor wretch will be found
willing to undertake the job at the figure
named ; but it is to be hoped that though he
understands he is to consider his whole time
as "engaged by the Governors," he will
make a successful stand for "some relaxa-
tion at the vacations," — and, coûte que

PILLS AND PUPILS.
As there seems to be some doubt about
the time in which the staff of the Royal
Holloway College will be in full working
order, Mr. Punch has much pleasure in
jotting down a few questions, which to-
gether can serve, in the interim, as an
Examination Paper for Candidates for
admission :—
1. Who was the late Mr. HOLLOW AT, and
why did he assume the title of Professor?
2. Trace the connection between the con-

Believe me, faithfully yours,
ARTHUR HACKSON.

Quite the Eight Sorter Fellow,
the book which you kindly forward.
MY DEAK Том,
WITH all the affectionate interest of a nephew, and an
author, you upbraid me for lingering over "my musty old books,"
and neglecting " the utterances of clear contemporary genius." Now
in the first place, my old books are not "musty." They are better
printed than your modern stuff, on vellum or paper, not made mostly
of some mineral substance, and the edges are not gilded with some
brazen Britannia metal, like that now in use. But you care for none
of these things, and maintain that the writing of to-day is better and
simpler than the style of my old Sir THOMAS BHOWNES and BURTONS.
I may be prejudiced, but I don't think you are right. To-day I
wished, out of pure weariness of the spirit, to look into this Irish
hubbub, and opened a book by an author, whose style is lauded even
by persons who dispute his accuracy. And I found in The English
in Ireland,—I found an Asylum for Mixed Metaphors. "Wherever
the traveller through Ireland discovers," says Mr. FROUDE, "in the
midst of the wilderness, the signs of exceptional cultivation
these, he may assure himself, are the hoof-prints of some English
family." Why "hoof-prints?" Is it to please the Irish that the
English are credited with hoofs?
In the very next page, what stuff, my dear boy, is this f "The
Squire and Squireen betted, smuggled, fought, ravished, drowned
themselves and their fortunes, in claret, debt, and prodigality."
Passe for the claret—the Bed Sea, in which Lord STEYNE laid nis
ghosts. But in the following sentence, Mr. FHOUDE speaks—after
the drowning in the claret, of "those who lacked backbone, to swim
against the stream, but who were unable in such an atmosphere, to
find satisfaction," and so on. Think of a backboneless man, unable
"to swim against the stream,"—of claret, I presume—and also unable
to be satisfied "in such an atmosphere,"—the atmosphere of the
stream, apparently. In a couple of pages, "the better sort" out of
the stream at last,—" dropped off from the narrow road to the
broad." You may stray from one road to another, but how can you
"drop off?" These, my dear nephew, are examples from the first
three pages opened at random, of your great master of style. You
sneer at MACAULAY, but, in the matter of metaphors, MACAULAY at
least "jined his flats." Mr. FBOTTDE'S "flats" are not "fined ; " in
the carpenter's work of his stage, he falls below the humble
standard of the old "Vic," or the "Brittaniaroxton." I return to
my old books, whose authors could write.
Your affectionate Uncle,
THOMAS SMITH.
VI.
MY DEAR JONES,
WHO would be a father in these times? The stress of com-
petition, the rush into every market, and thé harsh system of
examinations, combine to perplex a parent, and increase his trouble in
finding an opening for a young man. You know my eldest boy.
ALGERNON? He is,—though I say it,—afine young fellow, and should
"make his mark," though, of course, in these days of education, he
can also write. But he cannot write Greek prose or Latin elegiacs,
or English essays, so the Church, the Army, Schoolmastering, and
even Journalism are closed to him. He has been most noble and
unceasing in his attempts to procure a Commissionership, a private
secretaryship, or a secretaryship to a Club, and has quite compelled
all his friends to do all they can for him,—but in vain. Nor was he
a success as the overseer of an Orange Plantation in Florida, where
he lost all his capital, and where as he humorously says, all the
oranges he could grow, made little but Je Marmalade Imaginaire.
There was, he says, (still in the style of the Theatre) "a severe
frost," which blignted the orange blossoms in his plantations. He
now suggests, (and it is on this subject that I want your advice, as
you have travelled much in the Southern States of America, and in
Central Africa) he suggests, I say, that I should take, and stock for
him, an Alligator Farm. You cannot but have observed the
popularity of alligator hide as an article of commerce. Travelling-
bags and cigar-cases are made of this useful substance, and he does
not despair of introducing it for ladies' boots.
ALGERNON'S idea is that, kindly treated, and brought up by hand,
alligators might be raised for the market in large numbers, and in a
reliable manner, just as we breed trout, and that the precariousness
of the plan of merely shooting casual alligators at sight could be
obviated. What is your opinion of this scheme? And do you think
the swamps of Florida, or the upper waters of the Blue Nile, the more
promising site, on the whole for a factory, and for the development of
this engaging industry P Answer soon, please, and oblige a parent,
and your old friend. Ever yours, AUGUSTUS BAKNACLES.

The following letter is evidently from some London Theatrical
Manager, but unfortunately the address and signature have been
obliterated by the damp :—
CAPITAL! Your Play has the highest qualities. It is poetic,
without being verbose: it is natural, without exaggeration. It has
strong dramatic interest, and I think that the part of Clione, when
interpreted, as I sincerely hope it will be, by the lady for whom of all
others, it is most evidently fitted, will establish your reputation as a
dramatic author on a pedestal with SHAKSPEAHE himself,—that is, I
mean (for you will not suspect me of any fulsome flattery) as gifted
with a genius for this sort of thing. Let TENNYSON und a home
elsewhere; I am content with you.
Yet as even SHAKSPEAEE himself requires the most careful super-
vision, so you will forgive me, if I say that your piece, perfect as it
is, excellent as it is, from a purely literary point of view, requires
professional assistance to insure success for its production. My stage
knowledge and ample experience are at your service. I propose
Slaying the part of Amyntor—did you not mean it for 'me Y—Yon

Mr EVEB DEADEST MAMMA,
I feel the time is come for telling you the relé truth about
this scool. I am sory to say it is not nearly such a nice place as it
looked when you came to see it, but you must not be unhappy about
that. I am trymg hard to be brave and ohearful. Now I will tell
you about the life here. My form-master means to be kind, I am
shore; but he is hasty, and throws books at the boys, and, if he
misses a boy, he canes Vim. But I have not been caned yet-^-not by
him. The Head Master caned me because I would say my diktasion
the way you taught me. But I do not mind, my dere mother, and
my whales are almost well. There is rather a nice boy site next to
me. _ He says he has supressed his measeis for a fortnight, and is
afraid he can't keep them in much longer. The other boys are very
well, except two in bed in my dormitory with a kind of rash, which
the matron says is only tifoid. German and French measeis have
been very popular, and a man with crape round his hat calls every
morning with the other tradesmen for orders, which looks funnyatfirst.
There are a good many bulleys among the big boys—one boxed
my ears with a cricket-bat last week, though I am beginning to
hear with my left if you shout down it; and then, as Uncle BOB
said, I ort to be knoked about, but it is not pleasant at first.
_ The night before last we had a burglar break in. He fired his
pistle at a boy who bared his progress, but he did not take my life,
only my toy yat. and the cake Aunt MATILDA gave me; so I ought
to be a grateful boy.
Some of the boys thought the hedmaster might have done more
than crorl under his bed while the burglar was here; but you know,
dere mother, he could not help being atacked by panuic; and, after
all, we are not his own boys, only borders.
There is a good deal of drinking going on in the bedrooms by the
bigger boys; but praps, as they say, it is only water, which it
certainly risembles a little.
I often wunder if the holidays ever will come, and my hed akes
with so much studdy, and I feel very languid when I go to bed and
sob myself to »leap. Still I hope I shall eervive one term of it,
though I promise I will write the moment I feel I can bear it no
longer. Your afectionat Son,
TOMMY WASHINGTON E ARXCAKTÎ.
P.S. Píese don't alude to anything in this, if you write here.

however, in addition to engagement, you could guarantee her a

Think of my devotion in writing to you! We have had a terrible
week. I had, of course, to take MAUDE to Lord's. Nearly every one
in white, very few people one knew. The young men grow more and
more ill-bred. A friend of REGINALD'S nearly laughed -when I asked
bim why the Cambridge men run after the Oxford men's knocks, — I
would let them ran after their own knocks. I think the Australians
won. Talking of Australians, I never saw anyone like МАША. You
know REGINALD found her and married her at Melbourne, and she is
being trotted round before the family, for inspection. She takes it
very calmly. She admires nothing. Westminster Abbey, reminds
her a little of the Rev. Mr. вп.КЕЗ*8 tabernacle at Boonoorung. Of
course, she needs everything, but I can do nothing with her. I took
her to FELISE'S, and Madame STYLEY'S— she said she saw she would
have to write out to Melbourne for what she needed! Can one be
more Colonial? However, I have done my duty. Oh, these
Elections! Nothing but Politics. When will people be rational

BUCKINGHAM PALACE v. ALBERT PALACE.
IT was unfortunate that H.R.H. should have selected last Friday
for a State Ball at Buckingham Palace, as on that same night,
Mr. WILLIAM HOLLAND, the People's Caterer, was giving an "Aris-
tocratic Fête" at the Albert Palace, Battersea Park, which must
have robbed the Royal saloons of many of their most distinguished
ornaments. The privilege of admission to the Albert Palace was,
as placarded at the door, "for cash only," and this announcement
may have caused some of the leading members of the aristocracy
to turn back and seek the less exclusive hospitality of Buckingham
Palace, where anyone could get in merely for the asking. But those
who were fortunate enough to possess the necessary silver vouchers
spent a really very happy evening in shooting for nuts, taking light
refreshment», listening to the singing in the Café Chantant.
applauding WILLIAM the Caterer's speech, and witnessing the comical
fireworks. The Aristocratic Feters, having evidently ordered their
carriages much later than was necessary, were for the most part
compelled to " step it" all the way home, the supply of cabs being
very limited, or perhaps the coachmen had made a mistake between
the two palaces, as there were a considerable number of aristocratie
equipages waiting in St. James's Park. Next Season two such great
events must not happen on the same evening.

THE FINISH!
BEATEK! All the world 's agape,
As the winner breasts the tape.
Beaten, he the veteran "ped,"
Fleet of foot who long hath led
Over every distance; Well
Tides will tarn, and time will tell.
He 'd the choice of hour and course,
His the challenge. Fire and force
Failed him not, he did not flinch.
Shirk the spurt or fear the pinch.
But his rival dark and grim
Clearly has the foot of him.
His foreboding backers looked
Grave; but he no warning brooked.
He so often tried, so clever,
Felt as confident as ever.
Friends had he amid the throng,
Loud their shouts, their cheers rang strong,
Hats were tossed with the old zeal,
All his muscles seemed like steel:
He was never known to tire,
For the fray he felt a-fire;
Muttered doubts were all unheard.
Beaten by Black BOB? Absurd I
On I On final glorious spin
Crowned by one more splendid win,
And the veteran, vanquished never,
Quits the cinder-path for ever!
Fate not always grants a close
Such as brilliant peds propose.
What can ail that runner fleet?
Doth Atra Cura weight his feet?
Spite of all the ancient dash.
Black BOB 's by him like a flash,
Spite of spurts prodigious, WILL
Falls into the rear, and still
BOB pounds on toward the tape.
Beaten! There is no escape.
ALL ROUND THE POND.
THERE having been some question raised,
on sanitary grounds, as to the possible effects
on the health of the children visiting the
neighbourhood of the Round Pond during the
prosecution of the " works " now in progress
m Kensington Gardens, the following brief
synopsis of regulations for the guidance of
nursemaids, and others nearing the spot, has
been drafted by the Authorities :—
1. The most wholesome time for walking in
the neighbourhood of the emptied pond would
be in the cool of the evening after nine at
night and between that hour and sunrise the
following morning.
2. Should it not be found convenient for
parents to send their children out at the hours
above indicated as most fitting, it would be
as well that they should not allow them to
stay too long in the immediate vicinity of
the fresh black mud, especially when the
thermometer is marking; 83° in the shade,
unless—
(a) being a child in arms, it is provided
with an ample respirator: or
(b) being one or more children in a per-
ambulator, they are protected by a
curtain steeped in carbolic acid; or
(c) being several children of the same
household, they are accompanied by the
family doctor, who will prescribe freely
for them at the nearest chemist's on
leaving the Gardens.
3. In the_ event of children having inad-
vertently loitered on the spot, without having
had regard to any of the foregoing precau-
tions, they should, on going home, be
narrowly watched, when one or more of the
following symptoms may be confidently
expected to develops themselves :—
(a) An eruption of blue spots on the chest,
arms, and face,
(i) Violent shivering-fits, accompanied by
nysteries.
(c) Paralytic seizure, more or less pronounced.
(d) Total prostration of the nervous system,
accompanied by coma.

From our discordant strife.
I 'd link G.'s perplexed meanings,
But I can't, and it mars my peace;
I tremble here in the silence,
And would that the war would cease.
I have sought, but I seek it vainly,

And entered into mine.

or herd, and nothink but the honnerabel understanding as exists
between hed waiters and gentelmen, purmits that puffect free-
dom of speech so esential to reel enjoyment. So the heager Public
will be terribly disapinted if they expees from my pen an ink any one
line as 'ud bring a blush to any blooming cheek, or pane to any living
sole; but, without trenching on that sacred soil, there seems to me to
he plenty of emusing and even hintresting fax as the Public would
not willingly let dye, as as cum to my eyes or ears during my
perfeshnal career.
To begin with my werry herliest recklekshuns :—
I was born in the grate Citty of London, ever so long ago, the best
place for anybody to be born in, be he who he may: and if I was a
going for to be born again, witch isn't werry likely, I shood suttenly
say " Let it be there!" My good old Father was sumthink in the
Copperashun, I don't know what, but it used to take him every day
to do it, and wen he come home at night he used to tell us all next
morning all the wunderfool things and peeple as he had seen, and that
was how I got my rewerence for that grand old Institootion, the
noblest, as Г thinks, as the world ever seed. I didn't have werry
much skooling, my Father saying as he never had none after he was
10, and he had dun werry well without no more, and mine larsted
from the childhood of 5 up to the ripe age of 11.
The good use as I made of my rayther limited time, I must leave
my reeders to judge for theirselves. My mother being busy in the
shop, which was in the Green Grocery line, she allers sent our little
made of all work — I may say littorally of all work — to see me safely
to Skool. In going to that jewvenile prepare-a-torv establishment,
it was nessessary to pass near the bend of the Hold Bayley, and
ewery Monday morning, which was hanging day, I was allers told by
my little Nnss, that if I was a good boy I shood stand there and see
the people hanging. And the temtashun had such a horribel fassi-
nation for me that I was always good on Monday mornings, and
reseeved my dew reward, tho the dredful site used to hornt me so of
a nite that I lay bathed in prusperation, and, to this day, I never
can see a long wite nite cap without a shudder. I have told elsewhere»
how it was as I cum for to be a Waiter, so I needn't repeat it here,
but hurry on to recklekshuns of my future life afterwards. About the
werry fust thing as I remembers seeing happen at the Gildhall on a
Lord Mare's Day after dinner, reminds me of the wunderfool change
as has taken place in one respect, as I supposes I am bound to con-
sider to be a nimprovement, and that is as regards the effects of a good
dinner on mankind in gineral. Whether it is as the wines is weeker
or the beds is stronger, of course I don't no, but the diffrence is sut-
tenly werry striking. I know as it is so to me. Many and many a
time have I had to see a most respectabel gentelman home to his own
dore in a cab, and I never got less than harf a crown for my trubbel,
and sumtimes a good deal more. Nothink makes a man so gineroue
as a few glasses of wine more than he can cumfertably wark steddy
with and tork steddy with, but alass, all them good old customs is
changed. And no wunder, when I sumtimes sees as much water as
wine on a Dinner label, and I 've acshally seed two Mayniacs a tak-
ing grapes together insted of a glass of wine! Of course it 's all
right for ewerybody to be sober and good and wirtuous, or to look as
if they was, but we loses much of the freedom and the hartyness and
the freshness of the holden times. Ware 's your 3 bottel man now?
and the Echo ansers ware. In my umbel judgment the World's a
gitting too sollem by art, and I ain't not quite sure as they 're werry
much the better for it. We Waiters don t hear the joUy stories as
used to set all the Tables a roaring as SHAKSPEAB says, Waiters and
all, and wot 's the consequents. Why the gests all goes away sollem
and mean, instead of jolly and ginerous.
But to my Tail. The Dinner was over and the gests was a strollin
about the Lobbys as they used to do before there wasn't not no
Libery, when I seed with my own estonished eyes two gents a fiting
with fistes jest like quite common people. One was a Mr. Си im.i'.ji
HANSTY, M.P., or sum sitch name, and the other was a reel Common
Councilman, as I arterwards learned, and they was a nocking one
another about so horfully that I quite xpected to see the blud run,
but it didn't, when who shood cum up but my Lord PARMEBSTONE,
who taking the M.P.'s harm in hisn. warked away with him; saying
quite loud, "My dear HANSTEY you mustn't fight with' such a feller
as that!" and then he looked round at us, and acshally winked at
us, Waiters and all! Ah, he was summat like a Prime Minister
he was. I carn't qiiite imadgine either Mr. GLADSTONE or Lord
SORLSBÜBY acting quite in that Jewdishus way.
As I ain't got no notes but ony my memmerv to trust to, I carn't
put things reglar, but ony jest as they cums. The nex thing then as
I remembers is having to wait, somewneres in Soho, on a lot of French
Reff ugees, and I seed 'em mix a bowl of Punch such as I never seed it
afore or since. They put in it fust a bottel of brandy, then a bottel
of rum, then a bottel of gin, then a kettel full of strong green tea,
then a pound of lofe sugar, and then they stirred it all together, and
then they set it alite! They saw as I looked rayther estonished, so
the Chairman, like a reel gentelman as he was, tho' he was a French-
man, pore fellah! poured me out a bumping glass all afire, and sed

Write him down an

IT appears from the
Army Medical returns that
the deaths among the
troops at Assouan for the
last quarter have been two
hundred, or at the rate of
forty per cent, per annum,
and that the losses of
the Dorsetshire Regiment
amount to almost one
entire company out of the
whole strength of the
regiment. Moreover, the
officers on the spot say
that the men who are left
would be incapable of
making a six miles' march
in the existing weather,
and that they strongly
condemn the policy of
keeping troops in such а
climate at aU. No doubt
the officers are right—but
who is responsible for the
matter? Evidently, from
his selection of Assouan, it is
clear that he is an ass who

Where hangs the Lyre for sign.
Poor bardlets who despairing view
Parnassian heights divine,
Like some of us look envious,

Whose stanzas aye enshrine,
With nicest art, a tender heart;
Where hangs the Lyre for sign.
The hair of Rote, and Dora't nose,
In one wild sketch combine;
Our hearts are scarred just like the bard,
Where hangs the Lyre for sign.
Though nought could stay Incognita,
With smiles hid in her eyne.
One had full fain been in that train,
Where hangs the Lyre for sign.
A poet this in truth, I wis,
Of wit and fancy fine;
Horatian spells are his who dwells,

Good wine needs ne'er a hush, they swear,
Yet these poor leaves of mine,
Mid laurels die that flout the sky,

ROYAL BOTANIC SOCIETY. — Wednesday

or, Touring Made Easy.
FIKHT, as regards the item of CLOTHING. Make it a rule to dress
as well at you can everywhere! This will keep up your own feeling
of self-respect, which is liable to be lowered by constant contact with
railway porters, hotel servants, and lodging proprietors. Always
ascend a mountain in frock coat, lavender gloves, and a new silk hat.
If going on a shooting expedition on the moors, or in a marshy
country, patent leather boots and a white waistcoat are de rigueur.
You will find an opera-hat useful for startling shy game, besides
increasing the respect felt for your personal appearance. If you are
travelling over the Mer de Gíace, wear pumps, if you want to really
astonish ,the Swiss guides. If ascending Snowdon. or Ben Nevis.
you will find that mountain-climbing is an excellent method of
discovering whether your last new pair of boots is a good fit or not.
When at the station take an insurance ticket. Accidents may
happen at any moment, and it is as well to be prepared. As a fire
may break out in the guard's van, it might be wise to insure your
luggage in some Fire Office before starting. Carefully select the
middle carriage of the train, and avoid carriages which have any
defect, however slight, such as a wheel off. Arrive at the station at
least half-an-hour before the train goes, and spend the time in
making quite sure that the driver, stoker, guards, and all the officials
of the train are perfectly sober. Give the driver a subtraction sum
to do in his head, and ask him to pronounce " Popocatepetl ; " this
will be sure to unmask him, if he is intoxicated, unless he refuses to
answer at all, as is quite probable, in which case you can appeal to
the station-master, if you like, who will most likely lock you up till
the arrival of a policeman, as a new kind of lunatic at large. How-
ever, even this would be preferable to the prospect of having an
inebriated engine-driver in control of the train.
Having secured your travelling ticket, your life insurance ticket,
and your luggage fire insurance ticket, place them all not in your
pocket, but in the band of your hat. This will give a neat and
tasteful appearance to your costume, besides enabling any other pas-
senger who is unprovided with a ticket to help himself to yours,
should you take a nap.
Have your hat. if possible, constructed so as to protect your head,
in case of a violent blow or fall. You never can tell that your
fellow-passenger is not a felon in disguise, and should he, in a dark
tunnel, aim a blow at your head with a life-preserver, it will be
quite laughable to see how disappointed he wfll look when he dis-
covers the thick iron plating inside. It will abo be useful if you run
into another train, an event which may happen at any time. In that
case be careful to adopt a proper collision attitude, which is as
follows. Lift your feet to a level with your eyes, and hold them
there as long as the collision lasts. In this way you will avoid being
jammed when the seats come together. Besides this, you must fix your
hat firmly on your head, shut your eyes, and hold on to the cushions.
Always carry a note-book, and do not forget a pencil, so that you
can jot down anything of interest in the conversation of those around
you, who will then probably take you for a police spy. Ask ques-
tions about the crops, the local antiquities, the history and charac-
teristics of the places you visit, &c., and don't mind waking up a
sleepy fellow-passenger, in order to point out any nice bit of scenerv
that you may see from the carriage window. In this way you will
make "troops of friends "—who will troop into another carriage at
the next station, to get out of your way.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GHOST-RIDDEN.
I CAN scarcely quite remember when my martyrdom began,
When conviction came upon me that I was a Haunted Man ;—
But I fancy ten, or perhaps a dozen, years have passed away
Since the hrst of many phantom forms appeared to me one day,
In the shape of an unusually large and active Mouse,
With a face like a geranium, and the plumage of a Grouse.
'Twas the herald or forerunner of unnumbered spectral hosts,
For I 've ever since been harassed by the quaintest kinds of ghosts.
I had just become accustomed to this goblin, when I met,
In an unfrequented country lane, a Donkey, black as jet.
As he dawned upon my gaze I thought I must have got the jumps,
For he wore a naval uniform and patent-leather pumps.
But I summoned up my courage, and approached him with a smile.
Gasping "Good old chap!" and sundry other blandishments the
while;
Then he turned on me an eye that with a livid lustre shone,
Gnashed his teeth, as though in anger—danced a hornpipe—and was
gone!
I have often been awakened from an after-dinner doze,
By the vision of a Beetle crawling up and down my nose.
When this grisly apparition first beset me, I confess
That I uttered piteous shrieks of consternation and distress.
But as soon as I discovered that my visitant was naught,
A mere phantom, unsusceptible of being squashed or caught,
I regarded it complacently, and even made a boast
Of my intimate acquaintance with a Coleoptcr's Ghost.
I 've been haunted by a tea-cup with a handle like an asp,
Which, whene'er I tried to clutch it, glided gently from my
Yet the volatile utensil did not terrify me much,
And I felt that, at a pinch, I could put up with twenty such.
grasp;

But when a scarlet Camelopard with an orange-tawny head
Called upon me late one winter night and sate down on my bed,
Where it sang the Christmas Carol and " I'll meet Thee in the Olen!"
I concluded on the spot that I was not as other men.
Just imagine my amazement when a seven-headed Tench
Waddled up to me one morning, and accosted me in French.
"Boiy'our, cher," it said, "comment ça va?" I stammered in
reply,
"Assez bien, merci; et toi, ma vieille f" which rather wiped its eye.
But the spectre-fish was*sqoiabUv-it perched upon a wall
And narrated racy stories in the language of the Gaul,
Till I happened, quite in error, to address it as a Bream,
When it frowned on mo reproachfully, and vanished, like a dream.
Of the spectral visitations that I suffer when in town,
The one that most annoys me is.a Pantomimic Clown.
This persistent apparition is my torment and my bane,
With his loathsome string of sausages and, "Here we are again!"
For remonstrance and'anathema he airily derides,
While he plagues me with "Hot Codling," and with mimic buttered
slides.
In a word, his persecutions make me feel extremely sad,
And, unless I soon get rid of him, I fear he '11 drive me mad.
Lately, too, my wife has shrunk from me, again and yet again,
Just as though she thought that something were the matter with my
brain.
And I 've noticed that my children, whom I hold exceeding dear,
Labour under the impression that " Papa is sometimes queer."
Poor young things 1 I scarce can wonder that they look on me with
dread,
As a perilous progenitor, completely off his head,
For, whilst worried bv one gpolin or another ev'ry day,
I conduct myself, no doubt, in an insensate sort of way.
Why, I ask, should I be chosen as a kind of rendezvous
By this frivolous, illogical, phantasmagorian crew?
Why should spirits, all uncalled for, rise from out the vasty deep,
Just to tease me all day long, and even rob me of my sleep?
They are not devoid of humour, I confess, as spectres go,
But the fact that they are funny rather aggravates my woe;
For it riles me that the ghost of a Blackbeetle or a Moke
Should destroy my peace to gratify its fondness for a joke.
HINTS TO HOUSEHOLDERS.
HOW TO GET A SüMMEK CHANGE.
1. IKVITE your rich Maiden Aunt at Southsea to come to Town and
"enjoy some of the gaieties of the London Season." When she
arrives, develope alarming symptoms of general debility, say that
"your medical man orders you away, but that you really don't see
how you can afford it." It is ten to one that she will place her very
desirable Southsea residence at your disposal for as many weeks as
you may care to occupy it. Accept the offer with effusive thanks,
at once, or it may be withdrawn; and then take your wife and family
down to Southsea by the next train. Give your children the run of
all your Aunt's best rooms, and the free use of her most cherished
drawing-room ornaments and nick-nacks, and leave her to settle with
your London tax-collector when he calls.
2. If you are so unfortunate as to have no Maiden Aunt, at
Southsea or elsewhere, you might do worse than advertise your
House to Let. If you put it into a House-Agent's hands, it is wisest
to discover what his rate of commission is, whether he is humorous
enough to charge just as much for failing to let, as for securing you
a good tenant, and whether you have the wherewithal to pay him.
If you can possibly let your domicile by the Agent's help, and then do
him out of nis commission on the plea that the tenant came to you
"through a friend," so much the better.
3. Should any ill-advised person come to inspect your house with
a view to taking it, be sure to have all your best furniture con-
spicuously displayed. It would be as well also, while you are adver-
tising, to get a few handsome chairs, rugs, pictures, &c., in, strictly
on the Hire System. You can promptly send them all back as soon
as you have really booked your summer occupant.
4. If your rental only amounts to one hundred pounds a year, in-
cluding all rates and taxes, and you can extract six or eight guineas
a week out of your tenant, thus enabling you both to go away on a
jaunt and make money at the same time, you may congratulate
yourself on effecting a decided stroke of business.
5. If possible, let your own house in London and secure your
Maiden Aunt's house at Southsea. If you cannot do the latter, par
a round of visits instead to friends who haven't invited you and
don't want you. You will then be living absolutely rent-free, as
well as pocketing three or four guineas weekly out of your let.
N.B. The three or four guineas had better be spent by the House-
holder in satisfying the claims of Her Majesty s Revenue Officers,
and his own conscience, unless he is about to leave his house for good,
in which case the rates and taxes may with advantage be left for the
ensuing tenant to pay.
6. If all these plans fail, explain to your wife how really delight-
ful Kensington Gardens are during the hot weather in July and
August, and what a privilege it is to have the " Colinderies " so near,
and declare that you would not for the world dream of dragging her
and the children away from such a Paradise this summer. Then
pack up your portmanteau, borrow fifty or a hundred pounds from
any friend who is just off to Jamaica or Hindostán, and whom you
are not at all likely to meet again for ten years or so, and spend a
happy month in Switzerland or Norway, with a week in Paris en
route. Verb. sap.

ment« as was to be given to the Colonials and In jeans as is cum to
the Xhibishun, jest to show 'em how glad the old Copperashun is to
вее 'em, and to give 'em all sum idear of what they means by old
English horsepitality.
Like the fine old Stian Gennulmen as they is, they was to toiler
out their good custom of saying Grace afore meat, but they was to do
it on myth er a large scale, as was rite and propper. For a hole week
of Bankwete they was to have a hole arternoon of Grace, and they
dewoted the Sunday of that week of weeks to a grand service in Sum
Paul's Cathedral. On Munday, His Royal Iness the Prince of
WHALES was to drive the fust Pile, or to lav the fust Stone—jest as
he felt best abel to do as regards his strength,—of the new Bridge at
the Tower of Lundon, as the Copperashun is a going for to bild, all
out of there own pockets, as BROWN told me, and all our "Wisiters
was to be there to see how it 's dun, and to drink to the PRINCE'S

chorus, "Ood Blei» the Prince of fyhalei," and Sir ARTHUR
SCT.LYjtojr thort as they 'd be quite pufleot by the time, as there was
but few on 'em as hadn't already found the right cord.

nave it, I had been rash enutf to promis my nice Neece, as is ingaged
at a certain Theater as shall be nameless, to git her a peep of the
sherrymoniiil and all the elustrious gests, witch I could esily have
managed, but of course as there wasn't to be not no wittles I wasn't
wanted, so our little game didn't cum ofi.
She bore her disapintment werry pashently, tho the tears amost
filled her bntiful eyes as she spoke of her nut ral longing to see how
Princesses drest theirselves, so I prommised to get her into the gallery
at the werry next grand dinner as we had, witch I did last week,
and as I managed to get her tammut nice to heat and snmmut nice
to drink, and we wat te hare sum of our werrr grandest speakers, I
thort ae she wood be well repaid for her loss. Ah! they wat speeches.
thev was! The Chairman's helloouance was sumrnut mbblime!

He said that " arter the too long ears of the late ГляпГМлкЕ'я offiehal
life had expired, it seemed as if the zennith of'Glory had bin
reached!" He then presented his suoksessor with a Testymoniel in
the following flood of burning helloquenoe. "Wen, Sir, in your
declining years your faltering eye falls upon this Tee-Pot, yon will
feel like the old Soger in the well-known Song, who, when he saw his
old familyer Tee-Pot, shoulderd his Crutch and showed how Fields
was won!"
Naterally the distingwisht Gent thus addressed'was a little over-
come, but he pulled hisself together like a man, tossed ofi a bumper
of '47 Port, and replied right off without a paws. "Sir, in the words
of the «mortal Bard, the sweet Swon of II ¡ivon, this hevening shall be
engraven on the Tables of my memory till Time shall be no more!"
Ali ! that was a Bankwet, that was, it isn't offen as ewen I hear

had been inabird to give my fare Neece sitch a hinterleotual treat as
that was, speshally as being ony a hactress she couldn't, of coarse,
be used to it. Well I got her out of the gallery all right, in werry
good time, and as I let ner out at the side door, I says to her, "and
now have you injoyed yourself, my deer?" Wen to my most per-
found estonishment, she edrest me thus, "Well, Huncle"—she
always calls me Hunole—" I will say, as the wittles was good, and
the wine was good, and the singing wasn't at all bad, tho' I can hear
better any nite for a shilling, but as for them long dull dreary
speeches, all made up of butter and treeole, I don't think as I never
heard greater rubbish in all my life!" and before. I could recover
from my çerfound estonishment, she was gorn!

(By a Perspiring Enthusiast.)
TELL me not of claret-cup or ices,
Ice-cream-sodas simply will not wash,
Pleasantest of potable devices
For hot summer days is Lemon-Squash.
"Hatfield" at the Oval was golumptious

Of all summer drinks is Lemon-Squash.
When great GRACE is batting to the Demon,
Or when WILLIE RENSHAW 's on the smash,
Mingle me the sugar and the lemon,
Into it let the cool " soda " plash.
When upon the river I have rowed a
Pretty girl a mile or two at noon,
Bid the lemon mínele with the soda,
Let the sugar feel the circling spoon.
When I have been bounding like a cougar,
Or a panther on the cinder-path,
Then the blend of lemon, soda, sugar,
For my lips sweet fascination hath.
When beneath a sky that's worthy Venice,
I have won-^or lost—a game, or set,
Let this stunning tipple after Tennis,
Gratefully my torrid throttle wet.
When from concert, theatre or opera
To the Club I go with frame a-burn,
Let me tope serenely, as a topper, a
Lemon-Squash icett nicely to a turn."
When—oh, well at any time or season,
When it ranges eighty in the shade,
The sweet sugar, the tart torrent squeeze on,
Give me Lemon-Squash correctly made.

TIPS FOR TOUEISTS.
Do you desire repose, my dear BARBARA?
Then don't resort to crowded Scarborough,
But try instead the charms of Whitby,
Where is a noble sea to sit by.
Yet at these towns, as well as Filey,
The Bill of Costs will rather rile ye.
Up Scotia's " Bens " you '11 run, if frisky,
Though gillies make the pastime risky:
There 's air at Braemar, and also at Aviemore,
Which makes one enjoy one's meat and gravy
more.
Oban has steamers, and golfing has Berwick,
And picturesque fisher-folk nourish at Ler-
wick.
But Scotch hotels a tax do levy,
Makes purses light and heart-strings heavy.
Then there 's the Lakes — Grasmere and
Coniston,
Where dwells Mr. RÜSKIN—a scold, but an
honest 'un!
At Keswick or at Windermere
The scenery 's good, the climate queer.
Often will rain make your trip for to-morrow
fail;
Then you'll know "how the water comes
down " in Borrowdale.
Wales boasts attractions. Leeks and garlic,
And striking views, prevail at Harlech.
Fine sands you '11 see at ill-built Barmouth,
And also, nearer town, at Yarmouth.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
RUSS IN URBE.
M. DIMITE! SLAVIANSKY D'AoRENEFF's Russian Choir, gave two
afternoon performances last week at Drurv Lane. A non-musical
stranger, straying into the theatre and judging merely by appear-
ances, might have been excused had he imagined that one of
WAGNER'S Operas was in course of representation. The conductor

The Hues in Cho-rus.
was strikingly like Tannhatuer in "make up," and was apparently
habited in that hero's conventional garb " as worn." He directed
the efforts of a costumed chorus, some sixty strong and of both sexes,
in a manner at once original and effective. No baton did he use, but
merely waved his hands with a rhythmical turn of the wrist, standing
the while, with his back to the performers and his face to the
audience. There was no orchestral accompaniment, but a harmonium
obbligato, kept the Choir together.
The apparel of the singers, announced as dating from the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, was wonderfully well preserved. A dear
little girl acted as a kind of human telegraph, and hoisted on her
breast the numbers of the songs as they proceeded. This was a good
idea, as it was not always easy to discriminate between such numbers
as a "Siberian Ballad" and a " Celebrated Boorlak Song." An
"Entertainment Song," (from the Government of Tamboff) could
not fail to suggest the spasmodic utterances of the Rochester dealer
to whom David Copperfield sold his jacket. The title of the effusion
in question was simply, " О my Guelder-tree!" " О ту Raspberry
Both!" To which one feels inclined to add, "0 Goroo!" A more
horticultural and less anatomical old clo' man would find such an
expletive as relieving to the feelings as " 0 my eyes and limbs! 0
my lungs and liver I"—especially и the plants goroo in the neigh-
bourhood.
The Russian Chou1 sing extremely well together, and number among
them some good voices. One bass gentleman, in particular, goes so
deep, and sustains his notes so well, that he is heard long after the
harmonium and the organs of his colleagues have ceased to vibrate.
I looked at his boots, out they did not appear capacious enough to
account for the volume of sound produced. He is evidently Russia
leather-lunged. The historical songs to which the first half of the
programme is devoted, are doubtless interesting and well worth
hearing, at least once. But the "popular" songs in the second
part are neither of an elevated nor original type. They embody the
strains of much familiar claptrap, and. apart from the excellent
rendering they receive, are hardly worthy of serious notice. The
expression, modulation, and generally sympathetic singing of the
elidir however, deserve the highest praise: and not the least remark-
able feature in their performance is the admirable adherence to strict
time which they display when the measure is suddenly changed.

Iron, Officer in the Unionist Regiment.
[MODELLED ON MACAVLAY.]
Эн! wherefore went yon forth as in triumph to the North,
With your speech at every station, which the Tories raging read?
And wherefore did your rout send forth a joyous shout?
And where be the gapers that your northward journey sped?
Oh, triumphant was your route, but bitter is its fruit,
And mistaken was the line of your Manifesto odd.
Where you railed against the throng of the wealthy and the strong,
And swore the People's voice was the very voice of God.
[t was about the noon of a sunny day of June,
That we saw their banners dance in Midlothian fair and fine;
And the Grand Old Man was there, with his scant and snowy hair,
And Cow АИ, and Lord ROSEBERY, and Liberal hosts in line.
And the Chief by Soots adored raised his head and bared his sword,
And harangued his motley legions to form 1 hem to the fight;
And many a cheer and shout from their listening ranks brake out,
As the aged Sophist glosed upon justice, love, and right.
And hark! like the roar of the surf upon the shore,
The cry of battle rises along our loyal line!
For Union! for the Cause! for the Church! for the Laws!
For SALISBURY the Splendid and for JOSEPH the Divine!
The glamorous GLADSTONE comes, though without his pair of Brnms,
Or bravoes from MACALLUM, or cheers from County GUY;
They are bursting on our flanks. Grasp your pikes, close your ranks,
For WILLIAM never comes save to conquer or to die.
They are here! They rush on ¡—They are broken! They are gone!
Their ranks are borne before us like stubble on the blast.
0 CHAMBERLAIN, 0 BRIGHT, is not this.a glorious sight?
Stand with us, Gentlemen, and fight them to the last!
Stout GOSCHEN hath a wound: Sir GEORGE hath given ground:
Hark, hark ¡—what means this trampling of horsemen in our rear P
Whose banner do I see, boys? 'Tie he, thank Heaven, 'tis he, boys!
Bear up another minute: brave SALISBURY is here!
Their heads all stooping low, their points all in a row,
Like a whirlwind on the trees, like a deluge on the dykes,
The Tory troops have burst on the ranks of the Accurst,
And at a shock have scattered his Sawnies and his Tykes.
Fast, fast the Liberals ride, in oblivion to hide
Their humbled headst not destined at Westminster to meet:
And he—he turns, he flies, wild wonder in those eyes
That hoped to look on victory, but gaze on dire defeat.
Ho! comrades, scour the plain; look on the uncounted slain;
Give here and there a stab to make your work secure.
They lie with empty pockets who hoped to mount like rockets,
But cash, like votes, was wanting; their Party-purse was poor.
Fools! We possessed the gold, and our hearts were proud and bold,
Whilst you passed round the hat in an impecunious way.
Oh many a Duke's strong box for us relaxed its locks,
Whilst for your Caucus Clubs, they could howl but could not pay.
Where be your tongues that Lite mocked at Class, and Wealth, and
State?
Where the LEICESTERS that so boasted of their power with the
Trades?
Were the chaps in fustian clothes to be gammoned by your oaths,
Or had ARCH his vaunted influence with the mattocks and the
spades?
They are down, for ever down with the artisan and clown.
PARNELL trembles when he thinks of wild Ulster's whirling words,
And the Gladstonites in fear shall shudder when they hear
What the Unionists have wrought for our Commons and our Lords.
THE LICENCE FOB FRENCH LEAVE.—On Sunday the llth instant,
a bust of RABELAIS was unveiled at Mendon, when the occasion was
celebrated by a "Rabelaisian procession, speeches, and versifying."
It may be hoped that the latter was fit for publication, and that, in
the former, Gargantua, Pantagruel, Panurge and Friar John, did
not behave themselves top much in character. A Rabelais Festival
seems rather a peculiar illustration of "a day of innocent amuse-
ment." The population at Meudon, on that holiday may well have
thought what a time they were having!

„ So,—I am a Colonial with a large appetite, and am disgusted to
and there are no " Free Lunches" at the Oolinderies. What is Sir
Ришт CUNLIFFE ОШВ about, to let the rapacious Contractors
charge us for our food? I have come all this way to exhibit and sell
my goods, and the least thing this blessed Mother Country can do is
to feed me "free gratis and for nothing."
Yours, hungrily, SOUTH AFRICAN.

cet home. But

—j---- - •— * —— • —••- B°up, a bit of salmon, whitebait,
lamb and peas and new potatoes, a spring chicken, a little sparrow-
grass, goosebery-tart, cheese and salad, for eighteenpence, and I
wouldn t mind a penny to the waiter. My wife says Messrs. SPŒRS
AND POND could throw in ices for that money, but they disagree
with me.
I do not belong, Sir, to the " Classes," but am one of the
MASSES.
SIE,—The Refreshment Contractors at the Exhibition subject
some of their victims to great hardships. My son and daughter took
tickets for the " Shilling Tea," and, would you believe it, there were
no plovers' eggs. They were "out of season," we were told, as if
eggs were ever out of season! The plovers, of course, lay all the
year round. What I want to know is, who eats the eggs?
Your obedient servant,
A COMMERCIAL CLERK.
SIB,—I dined at the Colinderies, and, not feeling inclined to go to
the expense of the Quadrant Dinner, which everyone says is very
—\ we went in for the Exhibition Dinner at three and ninepence a
head. I affirm sincerely. Sir, though you will scarcely credit it,
that the soup was not real turtle, that our demand for a modest dish
of truffles stewed in a really sound Burgundy was not complied with,
that we had no peaches for dessert, and champagne was positively an
extra! Yours obediently, A V ICTOBIAK.
SIB,—The Jewish public will be indebted to yon for inserting
Setters about the catering at the Exhibition.
I have had to dine there several times, and there was no smoked
salmon, no matsaz, no bola, no " stuffed monkey," while horrible to
relate, the meat was not cosher.
It is simply a case of exploiting my long-suffering Hebrew friends.
Yours truly, IKEY JACOB.
SIB,—As a Correspondent of one of the Australian Journals, I
dined, in one day mind you, to be perfectly impartial, at the Duval
Dinner, the Exhibition Dinner, the Grill Boom, in the a la carte
Saloon, and the Canteen, and wound up with the Quadrant Dinner,
which struck me as a little heavy.
I also sampled most of the French, German, and Spanish wines, I
experimented on the Champagne, I even had a modest tankard or so
of bitter, and while trying several different sorts of spirits and
liqueurs, I did not forget patriotically to quaff a few bottles of
Australian wine, as well as some Cyprus of the Commandery [Oh!
Mr. GORDON HAKE, how could you !], which is not perhaps a reliable
drink after so arduous a day's work. Messrs. SPIERS AND POND are
world-famous caterers, so that I was surprised and annoyed, that I
did not feel at all weu after these refections, and indeed got into a
difficulty with the police, concerning which it is needless to go into
detail. Yours biliously, A VICTIM.
SIB,—If you have waitresses, surely they should not be above
making some return for any little gratuity you give them. The fee
is not compulsory, but dining at the Duval Boom with a friend, we
gave two girls a penny each, and asked them to meet us in the
evening after the close of the Exhibition. Would you believe it,
they haughtily declined, and seemed much offended at the suggestion.
Moreover, as we are both a little unconventional in our language
and manners, we saw a stalwart Manager approaching, evidently
intending to put us out. This settled the pair of us. We left sad
and dissatisfied. Yours obediently, TANTALUS.
SIB,—Messrs. SPIEBS АЭТ> POND say that they have a staff of
seven hundred persons at the Exhibition, and serve thousands of
dinners a week, while the same people come and dine again and
again. What is that to me. If I am not waited upon and catered
for as if I were the only man in the place, and unless they make no
profit out of me, (the deficit should be made up by Sir PHILIP
CUNLIFFE OWEN, out of his own pocket) in short unless I am treated
like H.B.H. the Prince of WALES, and also waited upon by the firm
in person, all I can say is, as a freeborn Briton, that I have a right
to consider myself, Your obedient servant,
A SUFFEBEB.
DOCTOBS AND DOG-DAYS.
HYDROPHOBIA isn't a specific disease. The mere prick of a needle
sometimes produces the same symptoms as those resulting, if they
do result, from the bite of amad dog. True, Dr. MOKET. Asimple
puncture may sometimes produces tetanus. Hydrophobia and tetanus
very like, one another, \ specially tetanus. However, don't many
people die of hydrophobia, after a mad dog's bite, whereas only a
few die of tetanus alter a simple puncture': And then, you know,
Doctor, that a needle-prick met with in sewing is now and then fol-
lowed by the same symptoms as those which follow a scratch received
in dissection. But comparatively how often? People die after both
bite and puncture sooner or later; but after clean or unclean punc-
ture or bite, how much sooner or how much later in one case than in
the other? Isn't Dr. DBYSDALE right in stating that very few of
Dr. PASTEUB'S patients have come for treatment from Germany, and
in attributing that fact " to the admirable way in which the German
sanitary authorities have kept up the muzzling of all dogs in Northern
Germany, and of large dogs in Southern Germany " P
Doctors may differ about .causation, but if, dear Dr. MOKET, and sweet
OUIDA, the restraint of dogs from biting is found practically to
prevent hydrophobia, whether hydrophobia theoretically result« from
the bite oi mad dogs or not, why. in the name of common sense, try
to argue the muzzles off the dogs noses?

Flower, a Peacock and a Gardiner, a Heath with a Mound, a Hunt

AN ISOLATED BEING,—(Old Mr. SIJÍGLETON, loq.) No, Sir I I

WHOOF! What a blast !' Seems to thunder all round.
The Gingham was big and the Gingham seemed sound,
Guaranteed hy its maker to hold well together,
A shelter at need in the wildest of weather.
That Grand Old Umbrella, admirers would say,
Might outlast e'en the Wonderful One Hoss Shay.
So strong and so tough, of such capital stuff,
What matter to it though the weather were rough?
It had stood many gales without feeling the strain,
And had held waterproof through the heaviest rain.
Its backers would vaunt, unsuspected of fib,
Its fineness of silk and its stoutness of rib,
And everyone looked on^its elegant form
As a beacon in tempest, a refuge in storm.
Alas, and alas, and yet once more alas!
For that Grand Old Umbrella! A piteous pass
It has come to at last. Oh, the storm thundered fast,
And there never was known such a furious blast.
It blew every way all around and about,
And the Grand Old Umbrella was aoon inside out.
Whoof! bang go the ribs. Whoosh! Away goes the cover.
Eh? Pull it together? Alas! 'tis all over.
In the storm's fullest stress you may yet furl'a'sail,
But a gingham to right in the midst of a gale,
When its silk like a burst-up balloon is all shattered,
Its ribs dislocated and stupidly scattered,
Its slide all a-jam and its ferrule askew,
Is a thing that cleverest never can do.
No, no, 'tis a case of " Umbrellas to Mend."
When the wind has gone down, and the storm 's at an end,
The Grand Old Umbrella once more may be furled,
Its cover renewed, its rib-tangle untwirled;
But that must be left till this hurricane ceases,
At present the Gingham is gone all to pieces.

ME. H. T. SCOTT, Captain of the Australian Eleven, finished ofi

tional style. The first ball of the last run he " put away" for six,
the second he " dispatched" for four, the third he "personally con-
ducted" over the seats beyond the cinder-path for six, and the
fourth—and last ball of the over and match—he smote clean "out of
the play" for yet another six! Twenty-two hits from one over!
That is SCOTT'S lot with a vengeance. How pleasant for the bowler
and his " average!" Mr. Punch says, some way after COWPER, of
Johnny Gilpin fame,—
Now let 'a eine long live this last of Elevens,

And when he next is " at eixea and sevens,"

THE LAST SHOPKEEPER.
(A Tale of (he Km and Distant Future. )
*******
"YOTTES is indeed the first Shop I have seen in London," said the Stranger.
"It is the only one," returned JOHN JOUKKit, a curious pride contending with
the despondency in his tone. "I would not give way."
"To whom?" asked the Stranger.
"Well," said JOHN JOUKEH, meditatively, "the Stores, I suppose, began it;
but Capital and Monopoly carried it on. Bigness and Universality became the
order of the day; all small men and special vendors went to the wall. Thousands,
nay, hundreds of thousands, of small shopkeepers were ruined. Bit by bit,
however, they resigned themselves to their fate, that of being bought up—which
was just a shade better than being sold up—by their bigger rivals. Oh, the
sufferings of those days! I knew a poor fellow who kept a little shop in Pimlico,
of which he was as proud as NABOTH of his vineyard. To see that man take
down hie shutters, or polish up his brass plate, was to see a happy fellow doing
the work he doted on. But the ' ubiquitous Caterer' set up near him, and oí
course wanted to buy him out. PETER STTTBBS would almost as soon have sold
his wife as his business. He lost both—one by the ruinous competition of
Capital, the other by a broken heart, consequent upon his ruin. PETER hung
himself on the night of her funeral, and the Ubiquitous Caterer pulled down his
shop, and took the space into his own colossal premise«."
And you f" inquired the Stranger, curiously.
"I, as I told you, wouldn't give way," answered the old man. "I had no one
to keep but myself. I had savings. I lived on next to nothing, and I held on.
Of course my trade gradually dwindled down till it hardly kept me in snuff.
But I lived on my little capital, and held on. Gradually Commercial Centralis-
ation ran its course. Stores and Supply Associations became fewer and bigger.
Shops gradually disappeared from the streets of this once brisk and busy
Babylon. Everybody in trade at all became either some sort of a capitalist, or
some kind of a counter-jumper. The aristocracy and the capitalists between
them thus gradually monopolised trade entirely. The day of the little men was
over. They became clerks, warehousemen, shop-attendants. At length came
the culmination and crisis of the new ' tendency.' The kst 'shop' (save mine)
closed, and a colossal Company opened one monster all-
embracing ' London Universal Supply Association,' which
absorbed all the others, and reigned alone."
"Dear me!" cried the Stranger. "And is that a
good thing for the country?"
"Like every other tendency of the time," replied JOHN
JOKXEB, "it helps to make the few rich richer, and the
many poor poorer, to concentrate colossal wealth in a
continually diminishing number of hands, and make the
Multitude the Milch-cow of the Monopolist. That being
so, it must be all right, mustn't it?"
"And you f" asked the Stranger once more.
"I," said JOHN JORKEB with strange energy, "love
independence and hate Monopoly. I am also the most
obstinate man in London. Consequently, I am the Last
of the Shopkeepers! And you," he added, "are the last
of my customers."
"How do you know that?"
"To-morrow my lease runs out, and I must depart."
"Whither?"
JOHN JORKKU smiled strangely, and cast a curious
glance round his dingy and scantly-stocked shop.
"Who knows?" sighed he.
• * * * •
A few days later, the Stranger, impelled by curiosity,
made his way to the Chandler's Shop again. It was
closed. He inquired for JOHN JORKER. He was dead!

RULES FOR STTDENTS ENTERING THE ROYAL MUSICAL
COLLEGE.—Every pupil is required to bring his_or her
own mug (in the case of a young lady the prettier her
"mug" is the better), and his or her own tuning-fork.
Pupils of either sex are not requested to bring their own
-1 it ions, as this is calculated to interfere with studies.
To АЯ ENGLISH COMPOSER.—It may not be a compli-
ment to call a ballad a "music-hally" composition, but
it is certainly great praise to style it "a Music-Hallé
composition." Perhaps this was intended on that
Patticular occasion.
CARE FOR THE CARTHUSIANS.
Resolutions to be submitted at their next meeting to the Governing Body
of Charterhouse School.
THE Head Master shall be generally unapproachable.
In the event of the outbreak of any fever or appearance of any
contagions or infectious disease in the school, he is not under any
circumstances to be apprised of its existence, unless he catch it him-
self, in which case he may be officially informed of the fact by his
own medical adviser.
When it is known that an epidemic has declared itself, anxious
parents must understand
1. That if they apply for any information on the subject, they will
certainly receive no reply.
2. That if they come down to see the state of the case, and look
into matters for themselves, they will have it distinctly intimated to
them that they had much better have kept away.
3. That in the event of their refusing to see the matter in this
light, and wishing to withdraw their boys temporarily from exposure
to infection, they be requested then and there to take them off from
the School, and remove them altogether.
On any parent being forced to accept, but being dissatisfied with
this alternative, it shall be at last open to him to call the attention
of the Head Master to the matter by bringing it before the public
in the columns of a daily newspaper.
It will not, however, be incumbent on the Head Master to vouch-
safe any reply to the communication other than to indorse the fact
and emphasise his own autocratie attitude under the circumstances.
This action on his part may be followed up by further general
and desultory correspondence ending in nothing.
On the public not liking this solution of the matter, they may be
told either " to leave it or lump it."
"DEAR OLD SCOTLAND."—"Bang went Saxpenoe!"
CUTS AND CUTS.
À PROPOS of a volume called " English Caricaturists and Graphic
Humorists of the Nineteenth Century" (a title by the way rather
suggestive of the "devouring element," dear to the typical penny-a-
liner's heart) which is criticised under the heading of "Fine Arts,"
in the Athenäum (possibly because it may owe any merit it may
possess to the fact of being "illustrated"), our contemporary in-
ferentially accuses the author (who contributes the accompanying
letter-press) of being "a slip-shod writer," because he does not
accept Dr. JOHNSON'S definition of a caricature, "an exaggerated
resemblance in drawing." Surely this is breaking a butterfly on
the wheel. "Writing up to cuts," is not a process invariably asso-
ciated with the idea of the highest literary ability, and frankly what
does it matter whether the compiler is a " slipshod writer," or not?
Not satisfied with this initial mark of ill-will, the Athenœum
actually quotes some of the descriptive matter, in which certain
English Classics are catalogued as "trash" and "rubbish." After
this it would be scarcely kind to publish the author's name, the
more especially as it is not one with which Mr. Punch is familiar,
so that the mistake may be accepted as " a first fault." However,
that full justice may be done to his readers, the Sage of Fleet Street
suggests that any person into whose hands this volume may pass
should act in the spirit in which DUCROW watched a rehearsal of
Hamlet at Astley's. Said Mr. DtrCHOW on that occasion, "Oh, blow
the dialogue, and come to the bosses!" Says Mr. Punch on this:
"Oh, cut the writing, and come to the pictures!" The English
Caricaturists, &o., &c., do not require a guide to point out their
merits, especially such a guide as Mr. ;but no, the name of the
Gentleman shall mercifully remain suppressed. If he wants a nomme
de plume, let him quote from his own book, and call himself "Trash,"
or, equally elegant and appropriate, "Rubbish."

THE LOST LETTER-BAG-
( '' Zilera scripta mantt. ")
Mr DEAB PB-MB-SE, 1I-
IT is interesting to hear from той, that people are saying the
time has oome when I should decide what course I shall take in the
existing circumstances. I have not seriously turned my mind upon
the subject yet. But at a cursory glance, I perceive there are three
courses open to me. I might hold on to office, I might resign, or,
thirdly, I might not resign.
As to holding on to office, I may observe that I have reached a time
of life at which office has no allurements for me. I have been con-
tent to hold it as long as it was the wish of my countrymen, and if
it still be their wish, I will not assume rashly; that I should have
strength given me to withstand its clear expression. Certainly there
have of late been hints supplied, that the wish indicated on the part
of the nation is not so positively unanimous as I have on former
occasions had reason to believe it was. But it would not be difficult
to show, if the argument were one useful to pursue, that the results
of the late election have on the whole, been favourable to the policy
of Her Majesty's Government. It is true that on a balance of seats
won and lost, we suffer. But if you add the votes given on either
side, you will find that the weight of numbers is in our favour. It is
by an accident that the issue is settled by the votes of representatives
of constituencies. If it were to be settled by the constituencies
themselves, we should be sustained in our position. Still the usages
of political life in this country have decreea that it is the votes, not
of the people, but of their delegates, by which Ministries are made
and unmade. Regarding the situation from this point of view, there
is I must admit, a tendency of events to force upon me the second
course, namely of resignation.
There still remains the third course, not to resign, and whether on
the whole that were not more conformable with the true interests of
the nation is a question that demands and shall receive the closest
and most conscientious attention. It is true that in taking that course,
one so adverse to my own personal leaning, I should be conferring
a great favour upon men who have no right to look for favour at my
hands. It would relieve the Markise from an immense embarrass-
ment. If I go, he must come, and how can he form a Ministry? At
best he would be at the mercy of any combination of sections of the
House that might find themselves at issue with him. Then how
could HABTINGTON actually work in harness with the Conservatives,
and what part would CHAMBERLAIN play? Would he help SALIS-
BUBY to coerce Ireland?
These things are very painful in mere consideration. They would
be heart-breaking in actual operation. If I decide not to resign,
how much would be spared to these estimable men! Let us leave
matters awhile, my dear P . Do not commit yourself on my
behalf to any course. If people ask you what I am going to do, turn
the conversation on the weather, a topic full of opportunity for
varied and animated conversation. Yours faithfully,
m.
I NEED scarcely say that it is more with pain than with asto-
nishment that I have received your notice and acknowledgment
of my pamphlet, The Bishops and the Ballet, that I sent you,
together with an order to admit two to the upper boxes at the
Alhambra. That you should have returned me both, together with
an intimation that you have written by the same post to my incum-
bent to urge my dismissal from my curacy, only endorses the strong
opinion I have expressed of the anti-Christian opposition manifested
by the Hierarchy to the great, the purifying, the ennobling calling
the interests of which I regard it my proudest privilege to maintain.
I will not enter here into the perfect charm, the enthralling beauty,
the exquisite poetry of what your Lordship, apparently in common
with the veriest Masher, elects to regard as a mere "leg show," but
I will ask you, in common justice, to examine yourself, and see
whether your prejudice does not arise from sheer ignorance of the
details of the splendid art you affect to despise. Has your Lordship,
I would ask, ever attended a rehearsal of one of those masterpieces
of which MM. JACOBI and HANSENS' beautiful creation Nina is a
fair specimen P Have you ever even been behind the scenes at
night r I will be bound that your Lordship has not, and yet with
an ulster to hide your apron, and your ordinary headgear changed
for a crush opera-hat, nothing could have been simpler than to have
passed in at the stage-door, and have seen for yourself the earnest
purpose and entire devotion to thejr profession of those excellent and
painstaking ladies, among whom it is my happiness to have moved
now for many bright and useful years, a votary to their calling, and
a champion of their art.
You, my Lord, who contemptuously condemn them en masse, I
would ask you whether you have ever tried, in the privacy of your
own Episcopal Palace, any of the steps a f amüiaíity with which they
have laboriously acquired P Has yon* Lordship himself ever essayed
a " coupé jeté," a " ballottes," a "rond de jambe," or eren a " saut
de chat" î I will undertake to say that you have not, and yet you,
my Lord, would not shrink from passing an unfavourable judgment
on the excellent work done at the Canterbury in the days of FLOBENCE
POWELL, PHYLLIS BBOUOHTON, and ADA WILSON, or at the South
London with TOPST ELLIOTT and her sisters. It is. therefore, my
Lord, that I am again urging you to come and see lor yourself. 1
will pass you " behind" at the Alhambra any night you may select.
If you are afraid of detection, a pair of blue spectacles and a false
nose, added to the dress I have already suggested, would ensure your
disguise.
In conclusion, let me respectfully impress upon you that in so
doing you will be fulfilling one of your highest episcopal functions.
It is my earnest desire to see a good understanding established
between the Bishops and the Ballet, and it will be a proud evening
for me when I see your Lordship, even though it be in the general
hustle inseparable from an appearance behind the scenes, surrounded
and welcomed by its votaries. So convinced am I that, after one or
two experiences of the kind, your prejudices would slip away, and
that a nrst night in Leicester Square would in future know, in the
very front row of the stalls, no more hearty and boisterously-
applauding enthusiast than your Lordship.

SIB,
Bullocksmithy, The Pavilion, July 5.
IN answer to your kind proposal to bring down a team of
"Eccentric Flamingoes," and play Bullocksmithy any Saturday
next month, I must, I fear, give the Committee's reasons for de-
clining. Last year you came down with only five "Flamingoes,"
one of whom " went on a broken wing," and had a man to run for
him. You made'up the team with the aid of yeur umpire (who was
intoxicated), your scorer (a man of seventy-five), the policeman on
the ground, the druggist's young man, an itinerant photographer
who chanced to be taking a group outside the Pavilion, and you
were one short. The intelligent populace of Bullocksmithy, who had
expected great things from the Et F.," murmured at the want of
interest in the affair, and declined to be pacified when yon alleged
that Eccentricity was the accepted character of your Club. The
retreat of three of your own men after they had secured their
innings, to play lawn-tennis at the Hall, or fish in the neighbouring
rivulet, added to the sense of popular dissatisfaction, and you will, I
hope, admit that the Committee have reasons for declining your
obliging proposal. Believe me faithfully yours,
T. B. PASSONS (Secretary B. C. C).

Mr DEAR SlB WILLIAM,
I WAS very pleased to receive your encouraging letter from
Derby, and have to thank you very much for your recipe for
improving the voice mixture. Fortunately for the last few days, we
have had no occasion to have recourse to it, for beyond reading the
lessons, according to his usual custom, and addressing an harangue
now and then to a chance band of stray tourists, who expect to hear
him speak, and refuse to move
away till he does, he has really not
opened his mouth for any public
purpose. He, however, keeps, I
am glad to say, in excellent spirits,
and seems to derive much enjoy-
ment from the almost continual
dispatch of telegrams, post cards,
and letters. When not thus en-
gaged he is busy in the woods
with his axe, and as far as the
political horizon is concerned,
certainly appears to be quite in
the seventh heaven. I can't help
fearing a reaction. What about
another yachting cruise f But
without Lord TENNTSON (who
sometimes writes very uncivil
things) this time? Believe me,
Yours very sincerely,

I WAS saying the

as respees Dinners
and their conse-
quencys, but them
ain't the honely
things as has hal-
tered, quite the con-
trary. Just think
of the Play Hactors
for one thing. Why,
poor ROBSON used to
give us Tradgedy
and Commedy all in
one, when he played
Shylock, ecaa. both
on 'em much better
than we ever gits
now ewen when a
part. And then how
themuesells of one's
face all relackses as
it were, when one
thinks of Mr. and
Mrs. KEJBLET! and
Adelfi WRIGHT, and
gloryous LISTON!
Ah, them was times,
them was, and
didn't I go pretty
hoffen, and didn't I
gammon the Guv'-
nor as I was de-
tained on bizziness.
I sumtimes wunders
if my Boys gammons
me similar. Ah!
that's a rum question, that is, as we Parients has to hask one
another now and then. One thing 's quite surten, they hasn't the
вате temtashun, so they hasn't the same egsouse.
If ever I wants, for sertain reasons, to speshally please the Missus.
I takes her fust of all to a Restarong were I 'm well known, and
there we sleets a nice littel dinner from the large Bui of Fair, and
then I takes her to the Theater, for witch I ginerally manages to git
a Horder^ so it doesn't cost werry much, tho' I gits the credit of
quite a hextravygant heavening's emusement. Ah, the way as we;
sumtimes gammons our pore confiding spowsee is snmthink amost
two bad. If I was a wife, witch I thank goodness I ain't, I shood
allere think as sumthink was a leetle rong when my lorful lord and
marster was speshal atentif. But as to the Theater, why it's no
more like wot it used to be than Claret 's like werry old Port.
When I was a young man I used to wait at the Cristeal Palles,
when Млкуи, and GBEESEE, and all the Itallian singers from the
Hopera used to sing there on Satterdays. And they used to set at я
littel Table just at the back of the Concert Room, and I used to wait
on 'em; and one day, as far as I copd make out from their forren
gibberish, they had a bet about being ancored, and MAEYO-'ah,
wasn't he jest a andsome gennelman, that 's all, and as ginerus as he
was andsome—he goes up into the Orkestrar and he sings what they
calle a Serrynade, and its name was sumthink like "Come it
Genteelly" and he got sitch a ancour as I hardly never heard, and
wen he came back they all received him with clapping of ands,
GREKSEE and all, and then she went up and sung Ome, sweet
Опт" and sung it so bootiful as amost made me cry; and she got
jest sitch another ancour, and then they all clapped their ands at
her, and she made 'em jest such a curtesy as they makes on the
stage, with her ands holding out her dress quite wide, and then they
аП larfed together, and so 1 lar ft too, and then she acshally cum and
shook ands with me and said, " You likes ze nrasick," and I said,
"Yes, Mum, when you sings itl" and then she larfed again, and left
me. Ah, I wunder how muten sum of the swells there wood have
given for that shake of the hand from about the most lovelyest
singer as I ever herd, and one of the most but ¡fullest creetures as I
ever seed.
I've herd my Father say as he seed her make her fust apearancc
in this Country at the Hopera Ouse, in a Hopera called " the Gassy
Larder" or sum such name, witch he said he was told meant " the
Maid and the Magpie," but I think as how his pore memory must
have been a failing him. Fansy The Maid and the Magpie at the
Grand Hopera Ouse! of coarse its too absurd. But he used to say
that wen she cum a tripping down the stage from the back of it,
with a basket of flowers on her butiful wite harm, him and all his
frends in the Gallery thort as she looked xactly like a singing
Hangel! And we waiters ain't such werry bad judges of that
partickler article, speshally as we sees 'em at their werry best, full
drest and arf ter dinner, and trying their werry most to please every-
body, as all women shood allers do, excep praps just our own par-
tickler wives.
Ah! wat a grand singer that MAKVO was, and didn't he jest
f assenate the Ladys. Why I wunse heard a werry butiful Lady say,
at a dinner as I were at ending at, that her name was MARTHA, and
that one night when she was at the Hopera, in the Stage Box on the
fust floor, (I think as they calls it the Grand Tear), he sang a song
all about MARTHA! MABTHA! and held out his arms as if he longed
for her to cum to him, and that she had as much as ever she could
do to keep herself from jumping into 'em! Ah, that would ha*
been a staggering stage effect if you like, for I shood think as she
wayed about twelve stun.
My Father was, of coarse, a fine old Tory, so am I, and so is all ns
Waiters; naturally so, for altho we hear peeple tork of hungry
Raddicles, it 's ony just for common wittles and Deer, and such like:
they don't seem to have money enuff to pay for grate dinners. But
I remembers him telling us as a suckemstance occurd once as amost
shook his faith. The great Dook of WELLINGTON, the leader of 'em
all, past, present, or to cum, was a dining in Gildhall, on some werry
grate ocashun, and the Committee had got sum wonderfool old
Sherry for him, jest for a treat, and one of em helped him to a glass
of it jest to see his estonishment, and he jest sipped it. and all he
said was, "Yes, werry good, werry good," and then he filled up his
glass with water! As my Father werry natrally said, if it hadn't a
been that he knowed as he had wun the Battle of Waterloo, and a
few others, he shood have amost despised him. ROBERT

And see signs that the Romans once

Are the health-giving breezes that sweep Orfordness.

From there is a trip far too pleasant to lose,
To Antwerp or Rotterdam, just as you choose.

(Sequel to a Marine Ботапсе. )
"England has at this moment no artillery armament wherewith to defend her interest*
and her honour, either at home or abroad."—Letter of Mr. Arm it to the " Timet."
HEB MAJESTY'S good ship Tornado had done her thousand miles gallantly, and
was just nearing the appointed spot on the enemy's coast, on reaching which
the Admiral in command was authorised to open the sealed orders under which
he had sailed. He felt the moment to be critical, and came up on deck to have
a look round, and as he swept the horizon with his glass, ne unconsciously
crumpled up the large official envelope he carried under his arm with the
nervous twitching he could neither control nor conceal. But the Jack Tars aboard
were in high spirits, and eager for the long promised brush with the foe, as
soon as he should be found. And as the Admiral came aft accompanied by
his Post-captain and a couple of Flag-lieutenants, they [manned the yards and
gave him three lusty British cheers, which brought a passing flush to his pale
cheek, as for the moment, acknowledging the compliment, he gave vent to his
feelings and indulged in a step or two of the hornpipe in response. Then he
paused suddenly. His eye had taken in the form of the hull of an advancing
vessel blocking the entry to the bay they were rapidly approaching.
"That must he the enemy, I fancy? he asked inquiringly, addressing those
about him. There was a bluff reply of, "Ay! ay! Sir!" and, nodding his head,
he instinctively turned to the envelope he carried, and regarded its superscription,
"To be opened only when action is unavoidable," he read, repeating the words
thoughtfully to himself, as he neared the hatchway. "Well, as that craft seems
to be bearing down upon us, I suppose it is time to look at this?" He put the
matter tentatively in the form of a question to his immediate companions, and it
received a ready answer.
"Belay there! Your honour!" they replied, "but any land squab can see
that at this very moment she 's casting loose her guns to
let fly at us. We haven't a moment to spare."
"Very well, then," rejoined the Admiral, elated
with a flash of momentary excitement, "clear the deck,
and pipe all hands to open the powder-magazine. And,
while everything is being got ready, we will just step
down to my cabin, and look at this." He pointed to
the official envelope as he spoke and the four passed
the hatchway and descended the narrow little stairs.
As they seated themselves, expectantly, at the cuddy-
table beneath, they caught the strains of "Rule,
Britannia!" "Tom Bowling" and the "Bay of
Biscay" mingled with repeated bursts of cheering, that
told of the activity going on above. "Poor fellows!"
said the Admiral, listening to the mingled uproar with
a kindly smile, they seem 'as pleased to get at the
foe as schoolboys to enjoy a holiday. Well, we will
see what sort of a holiday 'My Lords' at home have
prepared for them." And as he spoke he carefully un-
fastened the side of the envelope with a penknife, and
took out the precious document it contained.
"And now,1' he continued, opening out the large
sheet of official paper on the table before him, "we
shall see—what we shall see."
He was still smiling pleasantly as he fixed on his eye-
glasses, and glanced at the flrst lines, when a sudden
pallor overspread his countenance. He rose to his feet,
and staggered towards a porthole. The Post-captain and
the two Flag-lieutenants had been watching liim nar-
rowly. They noticed his faintness. and flew to his assist-
ance. To pour out a tumbler of brandy, force it down
his throat, undo his official stock, drench him with Eau
de Cologne, open all the doors, and remove the skylights
bodily, was but the work of half a minute. He rallied a
little, but he could not address them. He could only
point with his finger to the unsealed orders on the
table. They hurriedly dropped him in a soda-water
bottle bunk, and eagerly peered over its contents. They
were brief, and to the purpose, and were as follows :—
"The Board of Admiralty, Whitehall, to the Admiral in
Command on board U.M. Flagship, ' Tornado.'
"It is to be presumed that having opened these orders,
you are within sight of the enemy. This therefore is
to inform you, that as each of the six eight-and-
thirty-ton guns with which you are armed has been
supplied by the Ordnance Department, you must
expect it to blow up if any attempt is made to fire
it. Your wisest course will be to avoid being hit,
and the Board strongly counsel you in any emer-
gency involving the nonour of your flag, to rely on
cutlass-drill."
The Post-captain and the two Flag-lieutenants read
the document m silence. Then they all three gave a pro-
longed whistle, and were about to address the Admiral,
who was now somewhat restored, and was gazing at hie
sextant with a puzzled expression, when a live shell
tearing through the side of the vessel, and carrying away
the Captain's sleeping-berth, bookcase, and breakfast-
table, reminded them that the enemy meant business,
and had already got his range.
"Well, Admiral, what orders ?" asked the three sub-
ordinates in a breath, with grim irony, picking their way
out of the surrounding debris, and gazing through the
hole, seven feet by nine, torn in the ship's side, at the
advancing hull of the enemy, that was now rapidly
approaching them, stem on.
What orders?" responded the Admiral, hysteri-
cally, "what but those that are given me there! He
pointed to the official paper with a fine smile as he spoke.
But at that moment another well-directed shell tore
away three sides of the cabin, the companion-ladder, and
the whole of the deck above their heads.
"' Cutlass-drill' won't be equal to this !" shouted the
Post-captain; and the two Flag-lieutenants, leaping over
the wreckage, and rapidly climbing on to the upper deck,
cried, "Call it mutiny if you like, but fire the guns we
will!" And, so saying, they bounded out of sight, and the
hoarse cheers of the crew that greeted them told hfo that
the Jack Tars above had been eagerly watching for
their appearance.
"Well," said the Admiral, despondently folding up
the sealed orders, and putting them up in his coat-tail
pocket, "I have done my duty, at all events, and I see
nothing for the situation out this."
He crept towards the stern as he spoke, and, cau-

a few momenta he was alone on the sea, watching the departing

"She is a fine vessel," he said to himself, musingly, as he watched
her taking up her position broadside to the enemy's ship, which was

In another instant a terrino explosion gaye his words a practical

MY LM.A к MABKISS,
THANKS for your note which is both interesting and person-
ally gratifying:. I think you rather over-rate my capacity and the
value of my collaboration. Still such as they are, I have to seriously
consider their disposal.
I see with great clearness the advantage it would be 1 <> (у«к, that
I should throw in my lot with the Conservative Party. What I do
not see with equal rapidity, is the advantage it would be to me. I
shall do very well as I am. I hope I am not making too much of the
situation, if I say I pretty well hold the balance. If I take office
with yon. my freedom of action is gone, and I am bound to support
you to all lengths. In return I get office and a salary. But I don't
want office, much less a salary. I hate office, which causes a man to
be in his place in the House of Commons punctually at half-past
four, and gives occasion for remark if he s a few minutes late.
Being out of office I can come when I please, and what is better, go
when I think proper, none daring to make me afraid.
Now, why, my dear Markiss, should I sacrifice this freedom for
your benefit Î You have done well enough by our assistance, and I
think you may be left to direct affairs with the assistance of your
own friends. Look what a team you have got. Think of the grace-
ful, genial, winning leadership of HICKS-BEACH. _ Meditate on the
trustworthiness of RANDOLPH. Muse upon the weighty character of
G KOI«; i к 1 Глм i I.TON. Sooth your mind with reflection on the per-
spicacity of Grand Caoss, the lightness of touch of W. H. SMITH.
Let these matters console you for any imaginary loss yon may sustain
from my inability to join you.
I will watch with friendly interest your endeavours to carry on the
Queen's Government. But as to being in any official way responsible
for it, I think not. Why den't you ask CHAMBERLAIN f
Yours always, .

tirely ignorant mind might have known me better than you appear
to do. You request me to subscribe to a Statue of ADAM SMITH, the
so-called Political Economist, and you ask my opinion as to the best
edition of COBDEN'S "Works. Idiot for idiot, I prefer AI.UKKT SMITH
to ADAM,—the former, at least, knew Mont Blanc as thoroughly as
the latter was ignorant of everything but the perjured and peddling
market huckstering. Of all the lund and leprous fallacies which
have blighted the heart of man, the most leprous and the most
entirely lurid is the self-styled science of Political Economy. So fly
away into space with yon, Mr. Correspondent, and leave an old and
world-weary man to reflect, in this age of potato-spirit and Glad-

MY OWN OAKUM; TOMMY.
I HAVE been miserable ever since I read your dear but most
alarming letter. Yon strangely misunderstand your mother if you
imagine for a moment that she can tamely allow ner only son to be
subjected to such cold-blooded iniquities. I am sending you a cake
by Parcels Post, to replace that of which the burglar so heartlessly
deprived you; and I have telegraphed to the Inspector of Police at
Market Rodwell, desiring him to follow the miscreant's trail, and
compel him to disgorge the model yacht—for that, my dearest boy, is
the correct mode of spelling this most difficult word. You must tell
the boy who sits next to you that it is only a mistaken code of honour
which leads him to suppress such a thing as measles, and he will be
acting most wrongly if he does not go to bed instantly, and keep as
warm as he can. To-morrow Mr. TIMPANY, the great aurist, is
going to run down to Penang House and examine your ears, which
may, for aught we can tell, have been permanently injured by your
schoolfellow s brutality. In any case I have written to Dr.
TBOTJNCER, insisting upon the immediate expulsion of such a youth-
ful monster, and also requesting him to reprimand the usher who
dares to hurl heavy books at poor defenceless lads. I could not help
letting the Doctor know my opinion of his cowardly and unworthy
course in concealing himself under a bed while a burglar was ran-
sacking the pupils intrusted to hie care! And, as I have also opened
his eyes to the abuses, which I gather from your artless and uncom-
plaining letter, flourish under his rule, I trust you will shortly find
a marked difference in the treatment you receive from all in the
establishment.
Oidy there is, alas! one painful sacrifice, my dearest TOMMY,
which what you tell me about the prevalence of measles and typhoid
at the School, will now render imperatively necessary. You have
already had both complaints, but your little sisters have not, and,
for their sakes, I have arranged that you shall remain at Penang
House after the holidays commence until such time as all possibility
of communicating the infection at home is happily at an end.
Your letter was so brave, that I know you will bear this last trial
with the same cheerful patience, and I have said enough in my letter
to the Headmaster to insure that, for the future, no one will behave
to you as they seem to have been doing in the past, which will be
some consolation in your loneliness.
Your affectionate and distracted Mother,

and follow each rondyfam, while the enobbling effect of the moddest
little sermins we dance at them is planely to be seen in their

even sweeting that I should desert my tender flock, and abandon the
excellent and helthy influence which is making itself so *::::

Spectaclar Ballet like “Actaeon,” which, duly heeded, will enable
one to be proof against the temptations of twenty trajidies, this in-

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
THE TOUR OF THE THEATRES.
DKAR MR. Nimts,
BEFORE leaving town yon asked me to drop you a line to tell
yon how "things theatrical" were progressing in London, during
your absence. У ou1, asked for a summary of the season, or as you
amusingly described it, (al-
luding no doubt to the sultry
time of the year) a "sum-
mery."
Here it is. All the Theatres
seem to be in full swing, I
should say swim (for yonr
obliging quibble has put me
in the vein for word-twisting),
as the Managers are keeping
their heads above water.
Being a little pressed for
time, and moreover anxious
to let you know at the earliest
possible moment how matters
are going, I have been doing
a couple of Theatres a-night.
On one evening I saw two-
thirds of the Pickpocket, and
Mr. DLXEY as "Irving" at
the Gaiety. On another I
knocked off the School Mis-
tress at the Court, and all
that was best worth seeing
(the outside) at the Avenue.
On a third I made up my
mind to do the FooFs Revenge at the Opéra Comique, and whatever
was being played at the house opposite. This did not come off, as I
could not get my dinner over before eleven, on account of one of my
guests insisting upon describing what he had seen of the Pastoral
Players at Wimbledon. From this you will observe that I have not
been wasting my time.
Before I visited the Globe, of course I had read most of the notices
of the Pickpocket. And the "consensus of opinion," seemed to be
the play ought to be a failure, but as a mistake was made by the
papers about the Private Secretary, "it's best not to prophesy before
you know." Quite so. The new farcical comedy or pantomimical
farce, or whatever it may be, is one of the funniest pieces that
has been produced for a long time, and deserves the success it has
attained. Messrs. HILL and PENLEY are Messrs. PEJÍLEY and HILL.

An Irvingite from Dixey'e Land.

Wait and Weight, a Character Sketch by the Hill-side.
They are quito themselves and consequently the best of good com-
pany. Mr. HAWTREY the lessee, is also amusing, a remark equally
applicable to Mrs. LEIGH MURRAY. On the occasion of my visit. I
saw the late Attorney-General in the stalls. When I say "late, I
do not mean that Sir CHARLES RUSSELL came in during the middle of
the Second Act, for as a matter of fact he was in his place before
the conclusion of the lever de rideau, (t.-^retty little piece nicely
played by Miss GBAHAJTE and others) but merely to mark the re-
signation of the Ministry. Sir CHARLES did not seem greatly amused,
and possibly was there to note the "make up" of a certain actor,
described by Mr. HILL, (who, by the way, was one of the originals—
the very originals—of the Sappy Land) as the " Grand Old Maniac."
The LORD CHAMBERLAIN suggested an alteration in the dressing of
some of the characters in the extremely clever piece to which I nave
just alluded, and the Pickpocket would give less scandal by his crimes,
were he to drop the notion he has stolen (or shall I say annexed P) from
that play or eke where, before any interference comes from the " powers
thatbe. The " get-up " in this instance is not funny, but merely
offensive. Verbum sap.
The Schoolmistress, at the Court, is delightful. Messrs CLAYTON
and CECIL (to say nothing of Mrs. JOHN WOOD, and nothing but
good can be said of her), are as charmingly absurd as ever. The
piece goes with a roar from beginning to end, in spite of the hot

Scene in Court, "Such an Admiral!"
weather. The IRVING business at the Gaiety seems to amuse the
audience, but, for my part, I am rather tired of these imitations.
À propos, the best imitation I have recently seen is furnished by Mr.
BARRAUD, who has photographed Miss ELLEN TERRY to perfection.
This clever imitator (ably assisted by Sol, the Sun—not the Father
—another smile-provoking quibble) has furnished wonderful like-
nesses of "three little girls from school" and the Mikado, the
heroine of Jim the Penman, and many others. May all these clever
people's shadows (as furnished by Mr. BARRAUD) never grow less!
Lady ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL, as I have already hinted, electrified
"the Royalty, Nobility, and Gentry of Wimbledon and its neigh-
bourhood" in Fair Rosamond, an abridgment of the play Lord TEN-
NYSON will insist upon callk^ " Recket." Why his Lordship should
have dropped the proper prefix to the title-name I know not, unless
it be that, after several attempts to obtain a hearing from various
London Managers he has found it impossible to get the "a across the
footlights." Contrary to the original, Henry and Thomas play their
game of chess with Tennysonian jokes (!) in the wood, instead of
using an apartment for the purpose. Whether this alteration is
judicious is an open, an out-m-the-open, question. Perhaps they
don't mind draughts! With this merry suggestion (I call it merry,
for is not chess akin to draughts ?),
I remain always, my dear Mr. NIBBS,
CHARLES—YOUR FRIEND.
A Tribute to the Three.
[AU Enghiml beat the Australians at Lord's on Wednesday, July 21, 1886,
by an innings and 106 runs, mainly owing to the splendid batting of ARTHUR
SHREWSBURY, who made 164 runs, and the excellent bowling of BRIOOÍ and
BARLOW.]
THANKS to you we 're dancing jigs,
SHREWSBURY. BARLOW, and BRIGGS.
Who '11 call England's cricket-star low,
BRIOGS, and SHREWSBURY, and BARLOW?
Here 's your health, ye Glorious Three,
BARLOW, BRIGGS, and SHREWSBURY!
"The Campbells are Coming."
THE CAMPBELLS Mr. Punch refers to are the CAMPBELLS of that
admirable Institution the Royal Normal College for the Blind at
Norwood, the devoted Dr. CAMPBELL himself chief among them.
And they are coming to ask the public to assist them in gathering
£6,000, in annual guinea subscriptions, by Christmas, 1887. As the
St. James's Oazette says :—" A man who wants nothing for himself,
but devotes his whole life to the service of others, ought to get it.
Quit* so. Who '11 be one of the Six Thousand?

must be that in which the lineal descendant of old JOHN EVELYN,
Mr. W. L. EVELYN, M.P., records his gift of Sayes Court, Deptford,
as a garden and playground for the public. Parodying BBOWNINO'S
beautiful poem, one may say :—
Generous EVELYN'S gift! 'Tis said
GREAT PETER rambled here many an hour;
Here, where shall echo the workmen's tread
Amid the beds of geranium-flower,
And the lad and the lass, shall romp on the grass.
This is a change for the better, I think.
Emperors vanish and families pass.
But one name shall be honoured by Thames's brink.
Bravo, Mr. EVELYN! After a while
The best of us slumber beneath the mould;
But while children frolic, and old folks smile,
The memory of your gift shall hold.
One's name as green as the leaf to keep,
There 's nought like the gift of a generous hand;
And the Deptford folk as the long years creep,
Will mark, and remember, and understand.

Mr. Punch suggests the following list without regard to Party or

to be made Ministers are not Members of Parliament—well, they
should be. And the reply, in Mr. Punch's opinion, is unanswerable.
First Lord of the Treasury—Mr. PUNCH (with a seat in both
Houses, and a finger in every pie).
Lord High Chancellor *—Mr. BRIEFLESS, Junr. (with the title of

good enough to be repeated.)
(The above form the Cabinet.)
Attorney-General—til. T. H. BOLTON (supported by Extraordi-
nary Tithes).
Solicitor-General—Mr. GEORGE LEWIS (retained for the defence
by all his colleagues).

Republicans seem to be preparing the way by getting rid of all
titles to nobility—whether in impulse, utterance, or action. "The
Ignobles of France," however, appear to be a very numerous
clase, and their claim to establishment as the new aristocratic order,
with suitable titles of ignobility, may soon come to be paramount.

THE SPLENDID SHILLING.
A RETROSPECT OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY
BT л GRUMBLER.
( With Apologies to the respectai Sbadt of John
Philips.)
HAPPY the man who, when May-Day returned,
In pocket or porte-monnaie still retained
A splendid shilling! He nor read with
pain
The penny papers' picture-praising gush,
Nor sweet Sir FREDERICK'S sugary compli-
ments;
But with his " bob" upon the opening morn
To Piccadilly's proud Art-shrine repaired
Where, mindful of the Purists, whose stern
eyes
Chasten our souls, and quench all amorous
flame,
HORSLEY and RUSKIN, he, with optic glass,
Revelled on portraits, pups, and nursery pets.
Meanwhile he joked and laughed at HERBERT
quaint,
BuRNE-JoNEs ambiguous, WATEBHOUSE ob-
scure.
But I, who the soul's penury perceive
In Art as tame attendant upon wealth,
With hum-drum fancy and small acid fun,
(Barren repast !) no raptures could sustain.
Now August nears us, and the hour's at hand
When Art's proud portals once again shall
shut.
When all those splendid shillings shall he
sacked ¡
And what, in retrospect, have they to boast.
Who planked their liberal silver? Year by
year
The old old stories told the old old way.
The old old gazers with the old old gabble!
Smug wooers walk, babes chirrup; matrons
come,
And gloat and smile o'er what poor critics
puff,
Pap's inspirations, canvasses whose tints
Exhale the nursery's or the boudoir's scent,
Patchouli or puff-powder. Ogling eyes
Stare round us (one may trace their pedigree
From finicking FINDEN through the Fashion-
plates),
Telling romantic tales of amorous woes,
And teacup tragedies of tiff .and jilt.
These dexterous brush-men may turn out
with ease,
Trick over-shadowing Art, with a design
To vend their wares in the Philistine mart
Of urban Gath or rural Askelon,
Whence flow the aureate streams that well
might vie
With old Pactolus, or the golden shower
Which bare great Jove to prisoned Danaë.
Here, while my joyless minutes tedious flow.
With looks elate and eager pace, with thumb
Catalogue-turning, and lead-pencil poised
For scrawling annotation, the May-bore,—
Terrible creature feared by gods and men !—
To high aerial ecstacies ascends,
With backward heel fierce trampling on my
toes,
With strident accent mouthing platitudes:
I see him now, and seeing shrink and «hudder.
What wakes his raptures? Here a sickly
saint,
Sham BOTTICELLI, with pale conic beard
And fan-like hands; there a bucolic Squire
Broad-jowled and bigly-booted, in his hst
A hunting-crop—" So real," bleats the bore,
"You almost near its crack!" Here three
wax girls,
And several wooden swells sprawl bonelessly,
In spick-and-span Arcadia a la mode,
Soulless and simpering, but with much dis-
play
Of smart sartorial stuff, and millinery.
"Painted amazingly!" Yonder 's a thing
Of spermaceti flesh, sleek-moulded, flushed
With some rare rose-leaf ichor, not mere
blood,
Doing, and meaning, nothing, with a name
Chance-caught from BYRON or from LEM-
PRIÈRE.
"Sweet! sweet! " the gusher twitters, pencil-
ling deep
Cross upon cross in his crushed catalogue.
And babes, big-eyed and pulpy-lipped, by
dozens,
By scores, by hundreds, as though HEROD'S
victims
And the young thralls of the Pied-Piper's
spells
Had all come back on canvas. Here 's the
child
Who '' jumped" last year in swansdown, now
she dances
A minuet, in chintz; next year she 41 cuddle
A big bull-pup, in silk, or haply " paddle,"
In scanty cotton. Dogs and cats come next;
Anubis rules us, we are thralls to Pasht.
Like LONG'S Egyptians, not the Pasht of old
That POYNTER knows, but the mild maudlin
goddess
Of molly-coddle, patroness of pap,
And of ppt-boüers, who makes Art the slave
Of dandling, dawdling, domesticity.
Brain-work, true Beauty? Bah! Plutue
asks not.
The British Matron bans such dangerous
things!
And these twin-despots of the studio.
At whose imperative call ambition slinks,
And inspiration crouches, would have crushed
Beauty m PHIDIAS, force in ANGELO,
If, if the call were heeded. Whilst they rule
And whilst the Splendid Shillings freely roll,
And Princes praise and Presidents applaud,
Will Pietor plume his wings for higher flights
Than Midas wishes, than the Nursery needs,
Than Titan Advertisers clamour for,
Or than the " bob "-dispensing Public crave?
Not so. The portals of proud Burlington
Fly wide, ana let the crowds in, as a gap
Admits the sea: in rush the gaping horde,
They stare, they gush, they pencil, and they
praise.
Imagination here and there essays
To lift a radiant head above the flood,
The leaden flood of low and little aims,
The tide of maudlin mediocrity.
Vain effort! Still the muddy waves roll on,
Implacable, till, deluged by their sweep,
She sinks, deep floundering in the dull abyss.
CONSULTING THE STARS-AND THEIR COMFORT.
ORE evening last week the Royal Commissioner for India enter-
tained the representatives of Hindostán and the Colonies, at the
Colinderies to meet H.R.H. the Prince of WALES. As fortune would
have it, the
night was
dark, but as
most of the
guests had
brought
their own
stars with
them, the
absence of
the moon
was unno-
ticed. The
gardens were
closed, but
the Old Lon-
don Street
was lavishly
furnished .
with paper A Knight b
lanterns, and, to complete the 'general illumination, the guests were
entertained with light refreshments. It was noticed that nearly
every second person was either an ex-Secretary of State or a retired
Governor-General.
This marvellous display of officialism was leavened here and there
with individuals belonging to a far humbler sphere of life. "Red
tape" itself had given way to variegated coloured ribands. The
Law was represented by the present occupant of the Woolsack
and Mr. PITT-LEWIS, the Drama by Mr. BANCROFT and Mr. GILBERT
FARftUHAR, Music by Sir Автнтш SFLLIVAJÍ and Madame ALBAJÎI
(another star), and Literature by the ablest of pen-wielders. Thanks
to the ample space of the Exhibition, and the not too numerous

company, the Press was .never overpowering. The Prince suffered
no inconvenience from the mob of somebodies. Everywhere courtesy
was the rule, and arrogance the exception. Manners had evidently
been carefully taught and learned. No finishing-school appeared to
be necessary for those who could put a chivalrous prefix to their
names. Morn was breaking when the company separated, and
provoked the remark (made a few hours subsequently on board an
iron-clad at the Naval Review, where the cueste once more re-
assembled), "What a day the Knights are having!"
THE MAN OF GREECE.
"Among the wealthy and benevolent, who perchance may read this,
ehall there not be found a noble Briton, who, by assisting a young gentle-
man, of Hellenic birth, in laying the foundation of a brilliant busmen
career, will draw to his heart the everlasting gratefulness and affection of a
sincere fellow? Moral support is secure: material capital is lacking. A bonâ-
fide correspondence is warmly solicited by CONSTANTINB HAKILAO."—Time».
Is there no superior gent,
Wealthy and benevolent,
"Noble Briton"— we should
say,
Who will find good-nature pay?
Here's a man the way can
show—

To his Grecian vision clear,
Is a wonderful career:
But, upon this wretched earth
Men of true " Hellenic birth"
Lack the money; he says so—
'
"Noble Briton," won't you
"part"?
Take this Hellene to your heart;
He says sweetly in your ear,
He 's a fellow most sincere;
Ease his impecunious woe—
Men of business, gentle Greek,
We 're afraid are far to seek,
Who will give their hard-earned

Yet may money to thee flow—

VANITY AND HYPOCHONDRIA.
(USE OF THE LOOKING-GLASSES IN A HANSOM CAB.)
A FIELD-DAY AMONG THE CITY GUARDIANS.
THE Guardians of the City Union, rising for once above the somewhat dull
level of their ordinary proceedings, discussed at their weekly meeting a subject
that evidently suited them, and showed them in their very best form.
A Special Committee had been appointed to consider the highly important
question, whether the Officers of Thavies Inn—presumably a refuge for Casual
Poor-^shonld be allowed the sum of £4 10«. yearly, instead of the usual
quantity of beer. And this interesting matter naturally brought out the fiery
eloquence of the Guardians. The leading member said it was their bounden
duty to discourage the use of stimulants, on which a jovial member shouted
"Nonsense!" A still more jovial member boldly remarked that, if it had not
been for alcoholic spirits, the Board would not have had his valuable services
for thirty-one years. He added this most convincing statement as to their
beneficial influence,—"Why my wife gives my fowls and my canary-birds
brandy to restore them!"
Another bold member claimed the same right for their Officers as they claimed
for themselves. "He was exceeding sorry," he said, in tones of deep pathos,
"when he saw any member of that Board take too much." There were cries
of "Oh, oh!" but the bold member defied them to say they had not taken
too much. There were cries of "Name!" and sarcastic members remarked that
perhaps the bold member had taken too much himself, at which there was some
derisive laughter.
Then a very rash member, though a Common Councilman, demanded to
know whether he was one of those alluded to: but the hitherto bold member
said that he declined to answer; upon which the rash member indignantly ex-
claimed, "Then you insinuate that I am!" adding the remarkable words,
"I object to it getting into the papers that members of the City of London
Union get drunk.' Not content with that, he continued the subject by asking
indignantly, '• Did any member of the Board ever see me drunk?" To which
affecting appeal a member, who had hitherto remained silent, cruelly remarked,
"I begin to think you are all drunk!"
upon this a literary member said that he felt his reputation had been reflected
upon, though he did not say upon what, adding that for his part he had never
seen any member " top-heavy.' Upon this the bold member remarked that he
had never said anyone was "top-heavy," but simply that they had taken too
much; a fine distinction very creditable to his power of discrimination.
A presumably sporting member having spoken somewhat contemptuously
of the rampant teetotallers of Thavies Inn, asked two questions of so convincing
a character, that no one ventured to reply to them. "Why," he asked, in tones
VOL. хот. о
of burning indignation, "should Homerton and Bow be
dragged, metaphorically of course, " at the tail of
Thavies Inn?" Ah! why indeed; and, "Why should
they draw the line at Beer and not at Potatoes P" and
Echo answered, Why?
After these burning appeals the debate somewhat
languished, falling to the level of mere common sense,
and including a common-sense remark from a gentle-
man from bonnie Scotland, that what the Officers wanted
was not to give up drinking, but to have a choice of
drinks.
The motion was eventually lost, and the Officers are
not to be robbed of their beer, for a mere paltry money
equivalent, which is a fortunate thing for those under
their control. It is well-known that no one's temper
can stand much "worriting." He who confines his drink
to the same level as that of the poor unreasoning soul-
less animals, who never take too much and are never
"top-heavy," cannot avoid irritation.
MAKING THE BEST OF IT.
137, Little Jones Smith St., Paddington,
DEAS ME. PUNCH, August 3rd, 1886.
As at this season, when everybody is leaving
London, there must be a considerable number of impe-
cunious Peers who, like myself, are unable, from sheer
want of means, to go anywhere at all, I am writing for
the purpose of throwing out a few hints to those of my
order who find themselves in the same box with me, how
to make the Metropolis a passable place of residence
during these holiday months. I assume that they, like
me, have had to shut up their country places, dismiss
all their servants, part with their carriages, let their
town-house to some Colonial celebrities, and take fur-
nished apartments in a back-street in Bayswater. If
they have done this, they will still, I maintain, on my
plan find it possible to derive from London life much of
the zest and stimulus of foreign travel or the freshness
and vigour of a Highland tour with it« concomitant sport
and excitement.
Take my own case. I am up at half -past five, and off
for my dip in the Serpentine, which I find as fresh and
delightful as if taken in any Scotch lake or at any
fashionable watering-place, and later in the day I go
there for my salmon-fishing. I do not catch any salmon,
at least I have not caught any yet, but what does it
matter? I throw in my line, and wait for a rise until
stopped by the Park-keeper, whose invariable appearance
on the scene invests the sport with an additional ele-
ment of surprise and excitement. Then, as to work with
my gun — my air-gun — I get plenty of that at the cats in
the neighbouring back-gardens; and though I believe
that, owing to my having broken a stray window or two,
the police have been set to watch me in this pursuit, yet
I have hitherto had no reason to be jealous of my friends
who will soon be making their biggest bags of grouse in
the North. I have had an excellent time of it.
Meanwhile Lady BAREACBES and the girls enjoy them-
selves, after their kind, most thoroughly. We not only
mount on the top of a penny omnibus, and get our airing,
in the fashion indicated in your last week's issue, by
doing all the different routes in turns, but we vary our
means of locomotion by taking occasional trips, that re-
mind us of our yachting^ experiences, up and down the
river, sometimes even going as far as Rosherville, which
is, »or excel/tnce, the place to spend a happy day.
On the whole, my dear Mr. Punch, I can assure you
we are in no way having a bad time of it; and though,
owing, I believe, to the uncertain political outlook, our
income is reduced from £10,000 to £350 a-year, we
manage to make both ends meet, and, by following the
course I have indicated, contrive to get as much recrea-
tive enjoyment from it as we ever did in the days of Con-
tinental travel, and Scotch Moor. So it is with confidence
that I can say to my brothers in temporary ruin, "Go
and do likewise," assuring them that they will, with a
little contentment, and determination to take things easily
for a season or two, find it quite as bearable as does
Tours, cheerfully, BABEACBES.

as to the precise value of my statistics. I am not quite sure, for
instance, that six thousand tons of " blue slop," is an innocent top-
dressing that may be harmlessly spread about the Gardens without
detriment to the health of children of tender years frequenting them.
And again, on second thoughts, I am perhaps inclined to question
the proposition on which, in my communication, I so stoutly insisted
—namely that the heat of mid-July, is the most fitting season, from
a purely sanitary point of view, in which to try the experiment of
exposing a vast surface of undrained bog that is rich in the
vegetable putrefaction accumulated by a hundred years of undis-
turbed decay, to the influence of an almost tropical heat, It strikes
me as just possible, that, with the thermometer at 80° in the shade,
this exposed surface may give off fever-germs that might prove
deleterious to the health of unsuspecting loiterers in the immediate
neighbourhood, and although I have not written again to the Times
on the subject, I am inclined to think, from what I have privately
heard, that there is an active epidemic now raging among the
youthful visitors to the Gardens, who have incautiously wandered too
freely and fearlessly amidst the "blue slop" to which I have already
referred.
What, my dear Doctor, in your opinion, ought I to do under the
circumstances? Should I retrace my steps and give a note of alarm,
or face the matter out and stick to my guns? Remember it is some-
thing to have a theory, and I have boldly advanced mine. 8till in
the face of facts, I am open to conviction. What then am I to do?
Waiting your advice, I am, dear Doctor, Yours dubiously,

DEAR MRS. PONSONBT TOMPKINS,
YOUR Novel has been in the hands of a friend, in whose
taste and experience I have confidence. He informs me that while
the style is charming and attractive, and the incidents original and
thrilling, he is obliged to recognise that the whole tone of the book
is too realistic for our dull Puritan public, while the literary merit
places it over their heads. I must, therefore, most reluctantly return
to you In the Swim, trusting that it may meet, in other hands, with
the success it merits.
Believe me, faithfully yours, Т. Сивхк TONSON.

DEAB^ST Lucr,' Clapham, Thursday.
I HAVE treated you abominably, but, really, between the
heat and the season, I 've not had a moment. Of course, the hottest
day in the whole summer I was told off to take a lot of Sunday-
School girls for a " day in the country,'1 to Greenwich, which is sup-
posed to have an elevating effect upon them for the rest of the year.
Of all the disagreeable things I ever have to do, this is far the worst.
However, I may think myself lucky that I was allowed to drive to
the Station, the rendezvous, instead of having to tramp two miles at
1 P.M., picking up girls by the way, and making agreeable conversa-
tion for them, like most of the other Ladies. St ¡11, it is no joke
waiting for an hour at a suburban Station, with eighty "young
girls "—real younç girls—pouring in by detachments, all in the
wildest state of excitement, and decked with the entire contents of
their jewel-cases. Of course, the first thing they did was to rush,
helter-skelter, into a wrong train, and all the railway staff hardly
sufficed to pull them out again before the train started. I had a
whole compartment to look after, and felt rather nervous at the
thought that the next one was filled with men—smoking shocking
tobacco, by the way—and that the talk was distinctly audible.
I was truly thankful to reach Greenwich, and trusted that the
girls might be fully occupied in getting tea, and that the heavy cake
might calm down their excitement a little. So we all set to with a
great deal of unnecessary bustle, and were flattering our elderly
hearts that everything was going off splendidly, when, on the heu
being rung—we had brought one on purpose—for the girls to be
seated, the Superintendent looked round for the head girl to lead the
singing grace. Instead of pious music of any sort, our ears were
greeted with a shout of discordant laughter, which was found to
proceed from some broken ground in the distance, where the whole
of our first-class were engaged in playing Kiss in the Ring with a
party of soldiers from the neighbouring barracks. My dear, if you
could have seen the picture, you would never have forgotten it. I
thought I should have died of laughing on the spot. The hot,
dishevelled, romping girls, and the smart soldiers, quite unconscious

of the awful face of the Superintendent, aa she advanced towards
them, and the way the damsels scuttered off as she let fall a few
words of rebuke—it was the funniest thing I ever saw. She suc-
ceeded in driving her flock, sheepish but giggling, before her; all
but one, who stoutly declined to leave her soldier, declaring she
didn't want no tea, but would 'ave a spree in the merry-go-round
with 'im. A separation was ultimately effected, but the gloom that
hung over that meal I never shall forget. It was a mercy everyone
else took it so seriously, or I couldn't have held out; as it was, when
I got home, I laughed myself nearly into a fit.

MEMBERS WE SHALL MISS.
THE last Election made havoc with many Members of the former
Parliament. It displaced some old-stagers like Sir GEOROE TRE-
VELYAN, Mr. ALBERT GREY, and Mr. GOSCHEN. But where the blow
was sorest was in
the case of gentle-
men just elected
to the short-lived
Parliament re-
turned in Novem-
ber and dissolved
in July. They
had just got to
know the ways of
the place, were
but beginning to
enjoy the privi-
leges of Member-
ship, when they
were plunged
again into obscu-
rity — called
h e n o e by
, ;, early doom,
born but to
show how
sweet a flower
in Parliament
might bloom.
Here, for ex-
ample (1) is
Alderman
COOKE, tri-
umphantly
elected for West Birmingham. Mr. COOKE was, apart from political
enterprises, in the tack and shoe-rivet line. But he failed to rivet
himself to his seat in the House, and, tacking, has gone back to
the Birmingham Corporation. HENRY MATIHEWS, the new Home
Secretary, personally conducted COOKE out of
his seat, and took it for himself. Mr. CAHVELL
WILLIAMS (2) will no more paralyse Mr. HUB-
BARD and Mr. TALBOT as they sit on benches __ ,
facing that on which he Í;
took his place after being ¿v, ¡, *)
returned for South Not- jjff
ting-ham. Though Sec-
retary of the Liberation
Society, Mr. WILLIAMS
never liberated his soul
in ircch during his brief
stay in the House. In
November, 1885, he beat
Mr. H. 8. WRIGHT, the
Conservative can-
didate. In July,
1886, Mr. WRIGHT
beat him. As Mr.
WILLIAMS says,
fixing his pince-
nez perilously near
the end of his nose
if it were the
Church, and he
wanted to dises-
> tablishit)/'what-
ever is, is Wright. ''
Here's Mr. R.
DATTES, of Angle-
sea (3), not to be confounded with DAVID DAVTES, of Cardiganshire,
who became in his old age a Liberal Unionist, and was turnea out by
the uncompromising Welshmen. Mr. R. D AVIES had a lively contest
in November,. literally escaping with his life. It seemed hardly

(3)

worth the trouble to win the seat in November, to lose it in July.
Mr. DUCKHAH (4) was a gentleman of rather melancholy aspect with
strong views on the Cattle Disease. Mr. ROBSON'S (5)
>ortrait was taken after his defeat. He was better
looking when he sat for
Bow and Bromley. A very
able man, who with a fresh
opportunity will make hie
mark in the House.
Sir MATTHEW WIL-
SON. (6) is not a
new Member.
On the con-
trary, he is a
very old one,
entering the
House for the
first time more
than forty
years ago. He
voted for the
repeal of the
Corn Laws at
a time when
only six others
were found to
take the same
course. He
has been in
and out of the
House ever
since. Now he
is out, and will
be in no more.
Sir MATTHEW is sketched in the act of posting his farewell address
to his Constituents. We have some more pictures, but no more room
this week.

A GRAPHIC story here yon '11 find, by R. L. STEVENSOA,
It beats the Treasure Island—от any he has done!
From opening unto finish your attention 's kept alive—
The scene is laid in Scotland, just after 'Forty-five—
'Tis a tale of wild adventure most marvellously told,
And cunningly the writer does his clever plot unfold:
Throughout the narrative we find the author at his best,
'Tis full of fight and bustle and of thrilling interest;
The characters are drawn, you '11 find, with most consummate
skill,—
A book you ought at once to read, and read at once you will!

Says the Echo :—
"According to the Frees Association, the chief claim to distinction of the
new Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, ia that he is the husband of Lady LON-
DONDERRY. ThU is not тегу flattering; to the Marquis, but a similar thing
might be said of Mr. BURDBTT-COUTTS, Prince HENRY of BATTENBEHO,
Mr. LANOTRY, and other well-known people."
This is one of the wildest and most groundless allegations ever
made, even in a halfpenny newspaper. The Echo is likely to hear
from Lord LONDONDERRY.
That's All!
How SARAH must laugh at this foolish sensation
Concerning her cantrips a far foreign land in!

Who summed DIZZY'S story of daring and dream!
Success? On the cloud golden glories are cost,

When genuine brain-force backs limitless bounce.

That glance at the foe, at the floor, at the ceiling!
No, no, that's not Ряы. you're accusing of crimes,
But oh! it reminds me so much of old times!
RUMOURS IN THE AIR.
Ai the Exchequer all sorts of reports are afloat, the general pur-
port of the most reliable being to the effect that the new Chancellor
is determined to distinguish his tenure of the office by some striking
financial tour de force. It is said that he contemplates a decided
raid on the Income-tax, but whether in the direction of abolishing
it altogether, or of doubling it, has not transpired. As a bid for the
Tory Democracy, the removal of the tax off gin has been talked of;
but as this will seriously impair the revenue from Excise, several
methods of making up the deficiency are under discussion, the chief
being a duty on Gladstone bags, Irish butter, and Radical consti-
tuencies.
News from the Foreign Office is of less exciting kind, the new
Minister being understood to regard his duties from a grand-
motherly point of view, a fact that has already been appreciated by
one of the European Cabinets (supposed to be Berlin) that has sent
anonymously, by parcels' post, an old woman's frilled cap, for the
use of the incoming Foreign Secretary. It is supposed that the
spirited policy inaugurated by Lord ROSEBKHY will be reversed in
the hands of a politician whose highest achievement hitherto has
been to be shelved, through sheer feebleness and inability to con-
duct the affairs of his own party. On ilit, however, that he has had
a good supply of Continental maps sent in, and that his Chief has
himself written out a quantity of copybook headings, embodying the
principal lines of his own foreign policy for his guidance.
As for the rest, the new Irish Secretary is said to be eagerly reading
up all the Home-Rule literature he can lay hands upon, and that a
complete right-about-face, that will alike astonish enemies and
friends, is quite on the cards in this direction. The Lord Lieutenant,
on the other hand, is busily engaged in inspecting bullet-proof
materials, and being measured for suits of chain-armour, to be worn
under his ordinary clothes. On the whole the look-out is hopeful,
though it is reported that the Premier passes a good deal of his leisure
time in tossing up with a halfpenny to determine the many doubtful
points of policy that are perpetually occurring to him.

THE HAZARD OF THE DI-ON.
I)KM! MB. NIBBS,
As you have expressed your earnest desire to learn all about
The Jilt at the earliest possible moment, I hasten to satisfy your
curiosity. Well you must know that it is written by a gentleman
called DION BCTOCICAULT, who produced some years ago several plays
called The Colleen Bawn, The Octoroon, Formosa, The Fox Chace,
The Phantom, Jeanie Deans, London Assurance, and many others.
In fact at one time Mr. BOÜCICÍULT appeared to be ubiquitous, his
pieces were being
played at a half-
a-dozen Theatres,
at the same time.
But perhaps you
know all this, and
hare heard his
i name before.
Щ Well the play
I* performed on
I Thursday last at
the Prince's, is
full of pleasant re-
miniscences. It is
like Flying Scud
and Formosa, and
Hunted Down,
,„ . . . , , and London As-
A тегу gay Trio. A specimen of the Author's London ¡urance The cha
As8urance- racters ' are very
familiar to me. Lady Gay Spanker reappears in a new form, in the
person of Phyllis Welter, who is described in the playbill as
'' cradled in a manger, passed her childhood on horseback, and before
arriving at her teens, became the spoiled child of the hunting-field."
The friend of this eccentric damsel (who by the way has a speech on
the lines of Lady Gay's well-known description of a Fox-Chaee about
a steeple chace, which however
she shares with her mother and a
lover, instead of speaking it all
herself) is Kitty Woodstock, a
lady that seemed to be twin-sister
of Grace Harkaway, another of
the dramatis persona of Mr. Bou-
CICATTLT'S earliest comedy. Then
there was a sort of good-hearted
Dazzle, combined with a sober
Charles Courtly, a young Squire
Harkaway, and a female edition
of the boating-coach in Formosa.
Many of the other characters, in
one shape or another, seemed
equally familiar to me.
Honestly, I cannot tell you the
plot, because I could not make it
out. So far as I understood it,
there was once upon a time a stingy
nephew. Sir Budleigh Wood- m. ,, , ,
stock, "a Yorkshire Baronet of Winning by Myles: or engaged
great wealth and ancient lineage" a character irom the Colleen B
(see small bills), who had a needy uncle always in difficulties, to
whom he refused any pecuniary assistance. Then, somehow or
other, a more-than-middle-aged Irishman wearing a very palpable
red wig, appeared upon the scene, to be rather rude to a blackleg
lordling anda many-sided tout, and to indulge in "bright comedy


Scene from в Realistic Modern Comedy. So like the Grand Stand at
Goodwood!
repartee" generally. Then there was something about some
letters which were to be given to the stingy Baronet, to the utter
confusion of his wife. Then the more-than-middle-aged Irishman
made friends with the soon-to-be-confounded wife and her sister,
Kitty Woodstock, alias Grace Harkaway. Then there was a lot
of stable-talk, and a race in which the Irishman in the very pal-
pable red wig and "the spoilt child of the hunting-field" both
took part, apparently coming in a dead heat, the one mounted on
the favourite, and the other on a rank outsider, the contest being
witnessed by a crowd of Lord Mayor's footmen jammed up into a
triangular space, as if they were bound by an invisible rope, or
under a mystic spell. Then the " spoilt child," on account of her
riding, was introauced to Royalty in the Royal Box, and then and
then—well, I can't tell you anything more about it, as at this point
I completely lost the thread or the story. All I know is that the
piece was in five Acts, and so I suppose must have been full of inci-
dent. I did not see the horses, so cannot say whether the author was
as well mounted as his piece.
Seriously, Mr. BODCICATTLT would have shown greater wisdom had
he not offered to the public what he calls in the playbills bis " fare-
well tribute." The Jilt (why it has this title no one seems to know)
of course has good lines. The author of Arrah na Pague for nearly
half a century has done nothing but write bright and amusing
dialogue, and be did not give up the habit when he commenced his
latest comedy. But in spite of clever repartees and excellent acting,
(for it is most excellently acted) it is disappointing. The plot is
confusing, the characters old-fashioned. Even the hero Myles
O1 Hará bothers one. He is not so agreeable as his namesake of the
Colleen Bawn. Time was, when the improved English of an Irish-
man secured sympathy for its possessor, but since dynamite has come
to the front, his brogue is not nearly so musical. After my return
home I dreamed that I had been seeing The Flying Scud with a
female jockey instead of a male, Hunted Down without Mr. IRTOÍG
and Miss HERBERT, and Formosa with the trainer put into petticoats,
all being played simultaneously. This dream resembled a nightmare
closely, but it more closely resembled The Flirt. Believe me always,
dear Mr. NIBBS, СНАШ.ЕЗ—YOUB. FRIESD.
VICTIMS OF FETE.
(From a Colonial's Diary).
Monday.—Though very much fatigued by attending last week's
sixteen Municipal banquets, commenced again this morning by
running down to Mucklesborough and _going over the Cathedral,
Prison, and Workhouse, and visiting ajicient Roman remains, subse-
quently lunching with the Bishop. Finished up by Mayor's Banquet
in the evening. Home, full of enthusiasm at 1 A.M.
Tuesday.—A little fagged from the effects of yesterday, but started
in the special to convey us to Frillington at T30. On arriving at
Г45, we were met by deputation, and escorted with a brass band to
inspect the County Lunatic Asylum. Lunched in a tent, with the
patients afterwards. Dinner at Town Hall at seven. Grand affair.
Just caught special train back. Home full of enthusiasm at 3'45 A.M.
Wednesday.—Off, with a slight headache, to visit the Government
Detonating Manufactories at Blankhurst. Capital luncheon pre-
pared by Authorities. Passed the afternoon in witnessing various
kinds of explosives. Deafened by the noise but interested. Stayed
to the Mayor's banquet at the Town Hall. Grew enthusiastic and
missed the last train. Home the next morning by 8'25.
Thursday.—Feeling the want of night's rest, and altogether not
up to much, but manage to catch the 1045, and arrive at Bolchester
in time to join the party to the Coal Mines. Descend and go all over
them, lunching at the Castle first. Glad to get out alive, and attend
the Municipal banquet. Splendid affair. Champagne excellent.
Never heard toasts go better. Was seen to station. Sing songs on
the way back. Home by daylight.
Friday.—Feeling very poorly to day, and thoroughly fagged out,
but manage to screw myself up to the mark, and catch the special that
is to take us down to Westingnam. Grand lunch first with the con-
tractor, then go over the Iron Works. Suffocated with the fumes, and
very glad to sit down at 7'30 to the Corporation dinner. Very
thirsty. Drank the toasts enthusiastically. Volunteer an impromptu
speech. Got home safely with the milk in the morning.
Saturday,—Obliged to bandage my head with wet towels before I
can recollect what engagement I have for the day. Remember that
we are invited to Dingleoury, to go over a factory-chimney, open the
new baths and wash-houses, and inspect the convict training-ship,
lunching with Lord WINKLEFORD, and finally closing the day's pro-
ceedings with attending a grand banquet at the town-hall, given by
the Mayor and Municipal Authorities. Take a strong pick-me-up,
and determine to go, and start to catch the 11*40. Catch it, and get
somehow through the day's programme, not feeling "fit" for any-
thing, till half-way through the Mayor's banquet. Feel in such
good spirits from the effects of the dinner, that I determine to sing
them a comic song. To bed in my boots, but glad the week is over.

SOMETHING LIKE A MOTHER-IN-LAW.
IN a case in the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division of the High Court
of Justice last week, the Mother of the Petitioner for the dissolution of her
marriage complained to the examining Counsel that he had not sufficiently
established the Respondent's cruelty to her daughter. "Is that all you have to
ask me ?" she is reported to have exclaimed: "why, I have not said half enough!"
Considering that the Barrister in question had already elicited that the Husband
had frequently struck his Wife, tried to whip her like a child before the servants,
boxed her ears, and "many times" made her arms black-and-blue with his
violence, the Lady must indeed have been anxious to prove the case "up to
the hilt. If every Wife had so vigilant a Mother, the President of the Court,
and his well-meaning and sometimes quite facetious colleague, Mr. Justice BUTT,
would have less work to do in that branch of their Division labelled " Divorce."

A BALLAD OF BURDENS.
Some tcay after Swinburne.
THE burden of Old Women. They delight
In bulky bundles, always in the way;
In 'bosses close they wedge you tight at night,
In railway trains they jam yon np by day.
Plump dames with pulpy cheeks and looks of grey,
In weariness they waddle, puif, perspire.
To banish them for ever one woula вау,
This must be every busy man's desire.
The burden of Young Misses. 'Tie a bore,
A burden one would gladly from him fling.
Between eleven and fifteen, no more;
Thereafter girlhood is a charming thing.
But giggling chits set manhood shuddering,
And ogling eyes of school- girls tease and tire.
To stay their smirks and stop their sniggering,
This must be every wholesome man's desire.
The burden of Long Speeches. Nay, sit down,
Cover thine ears and weep, or verily
These platform pumps that deluge all the town
In these last days will be the death of thee.
In these last days, reviling volubly,
They pelt their foes with verbal mud and mire.
To send the babbling bores to Coventry,
This must be every silent man's desire.
The burden of Rich Living. Thou shall fear
Waking, and sleeping toss upon thy bed;
And say at night, "No sleep for me, I fear.'
And say at dawn, "Oh thunder, what a head!"
With luscious viands thou ehalt be o'erfed,
And wear remorse with indigestion dire.
To simplify the menu« wise men dread,
This must be every healthy man's desire.
The burden of Sad Colours. Thou shall see
Gold tarnished, ghostly grey, and livid green,
And lank and languorous thy face must be
To harmonise with the lugubrious scene.
And thou shall say of scarlet, "It hath been,"
And sighing of old tints and tones shall tire.
To bring back brightness and lo banish spleen,
This musí be every cheerful man's desire.
The burden of Smart Sayings. In this day
All wish as cynic wits to bear the bell.
Men mock at honour, justice, love, and say
The end of life " good stones " is to tell.
The cad's coarse jest, the cankle of the swell
Are much alike, things that the most admire.
To patter slang and tell side-spjillers well,
This is Ihe end of every fool's desire.
The burden of Bad Seasons. Rain in Spring,
Chill rain and wind among the budding tree»,
A Summer of grey storm-clouds gathering,
Damp Autumn one dull mist of miseries,
With showers thai soak, and blasts that bite and
freeze;
A drenching Winter with north-easters dire.
To make an end of seasons such as these,
This must be every suffering man's desire.
The burden of Strange Crazes. Woman's right
To throng the polls, and join the spouting bauds;
Theosophy and aslral bodies, sleight
Of cunning jugglers from far foreign lands;
Buddhislic bosh which no one understands,
A thousand fads that 'gainst good sense conspire.
To gag the crotcheteers and tie their hands,
This must be every sober man's desire.
L'EwvoY.
Donkeys, and j[e whom frenzy quickeneth,
Heed well this rhvme. Life's many burdens tire.
To lighten them a little, ere our death,
This must be every kindly man's desire.

AN AFFAIR OF ART.

HE Sage saluted each Member of the Procession as it passed
before him. бел-eral had come from Piccadilly, others from Pall
Mall, quite a crowd from united Bond Strett—New and Old.
"Any more, Sir FBEDEEICK?" asked the Sage of the leader of
this strange gathering.
"Lots, my dear and valued friend," replied the polished P.R.A.,
"and, consequently, those who oppose my wish to limit the number
of pictures hung by the same exhibitor at Burlington House, have
the less excuse. As I have said to my respected colleagues HOLL,
LESLIE, and COOPEB WELLS, nowadays we have so many Galleries
that"
"The House of Burlington should be kept as a place for speci-
mens. I share your opinion, Sir FHEDERICK, and feel sure that
Mr. HOLL, for instance, if he had excluded that picture of his of
Sir JOHN MILLAIS, from this year's Academy, would not have
damaged his reputation by the omission."
The P.R.A. smiled, bowed, and passed on gracefully.
"You appear pleased, Sir CourrsP" suggested Mr. Punch.
"I should think so," exultinçly replied the artistic Baronet, "I
have got a large picture on the line."
"A large picture on the line I Where?"
"At the Grosvenor Gallery," was the ready response, and then
the talented and titled LINDSAY added, " 1 don't know why it was so
honoured."
"No more do I."~returned Mr. Punch; "but I fancy I can guess. Well, Sir COUTTS, at any rate it is in good company."
An elderly Artist followed. "All hail, Sir Jons, President of the Royal Society of Painters in Water-Colonrs. All hail!"
"Thanks; but I am thinking of retiring." explained the veteran, GILBERT. "You see, fond as I am of dispensing hospitality—of
maintaining the reputation of the Painters in Water Colours—I find that one grows older."
"To judge from your work, I should doubt it," replied the Sage, with a bow fully as graceful as that of the P.R.A., and turning to
thejnext who approached him, offered him his hand. It was grasped with the utmost heartiness.
"Ah, Sir J. D. LnfTON, I am glad to see you."
"On behalf of the Institute, I thank you," said the President. "Yes, Mr. Pvnch, I most respectfully thank you."
"Tired of Fancy Balls, eh? No more historical tableaux Í No dance in Piccadilly this year, en?"
"We have given up dancing, my dear Mr. Punch, since they tried—h'm !—well, something of the sort at the Grosvenor."

Again the Procession marched on.
"What!" exclaimed the Sage, "WHISTLIÎR!"
"Tea," returned that eminent Artist, with a particularly musical
laugh, "I am actually President of the Society of British Artists!
Do you hear,—British! Isn't it a joke?" and the particularly
musical laugh was repeated.
Then came Sir JOHN EVERETT MILLAIS, smoking.
"You look to greater advantage than your pictures at the Hollo-
way Pillories," said Mr. Punch.
"Why, I thought they were capitally hung," replied the matured
pre-Rapnaelite. They tell me that the 'Princes in the Tower'
the 'Princess Elizabeth,' and the rest, are placed on a wall facing
the 'Railway Station' of FRITH."
"Facing FRITH! Then you would suggest that they considered
you his opposite?"
"I never said a disagreeable thing of a man in my life," puffed
out Sir JOHN, as with a smile he marched on.
Then there _was a perfect crowd—HERKOMER, and TISSOT, and
a female livid in tone hiding behind a picture by JAW VAN BEERS.
When Mr. Punch saw the last, who was staggering about like the
galvanised corpse of a Parisienne, he shuddered.
"A ghastly sight! Were all like yonder phantom I should call
this Procession" And then Mr. Punch paused.
"A classical triumph!" suggested the P.R. A.

A BOARD-SCHOOL JOURNAL.
"Compulsory Calisthenics may, sooner or later, become part of the in-
struction which the State will impart to every citizen at the expense of the
community."—Daily Paper.
Morning.—Up at six;, studying that difficult problem in Trigo-
nometry which floored me yesterday, and which the Head Teacher
said would have to be mastered before I could even hope to get that
Entrance Scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge. Rather inter-
rupted by father (who is a bricklayer) calling me down-stairs to
help mother light kitchen-fire and get his breakfast—also in efforts
to prevent father trampling on mother with his hobnails because the
fire would not light fast enough. Yesterday's Calisthenio practice
came in useful. Enabled me to vault skilfully out of the way when
father (in a moment of irritation) tried to smash me with the kitchen-
fender. Father, I am sorry to say, is not a friend to education, and
sees no good in Trigonometry.
At School.—First hour taken up with violent trapeze exercise.
Feel rather empty and tired after it, having had no breakfast to
speak of. Next hour devoted to viva voce work with the Italian Pro-
fessor. Then another hour in the yard with the dumb-bells. Teacher
surprised to see me nearly faint in the middle. Says nobody could
possibly get an Entrance Scholarship at Cambridge from a Board
School unless he was a perfect master of the dumb-bells. Believe I
should master them better if I had some food. Fear I 've no chance
of Cambridge, after all.
Dinner.—Thank heaven! Curious how much I look forward to
this meal. Must try to remember that I am fourteen years old now,
and that I must only care for intellectual pleasures. Feel more
cheerful, and really think I may get that Scholarship some day.
Afternoon.—A dreadful hour with the Trigonometry Professor.
Wonder why I 've that singing in my head! Teacher begs me, with
tears in his eyes, to try and master what he calls "this elementary
problem." Says the School will lose the Government Grant if I
don't. Very sorry, but really don't see how I can prevent it.
Go out into yard in state of despair. Cambridge seems farther off
than ever. Find Teacher of Calisthenics waiting for me round a
corner. Says he will lose AM Government Grant if I can't do my
Parallel Bar Exercise quicker. Begs me, for sake of his wife and
family, to try and exert myself. Do so, violently. At end of hour
feel pains all over me. Fear I 'ye over-exerted myself. But Calis-
thenio Professor very pleased with me—that 's one comfort. Asks
me, "just to oblige him," to have a round with the gloves before
going in to the class on Hydrostatical Dynamics. Make excuse, and
get out of it.
Evening.—At home. So 's father, I 'm sorry to say. Tell him
I've been doing Hydrostatical Dynamics, and he threatens to
"Dynamic me" with the kitchen poker. Hurry upstairs. Singing
in head worse. Violent pains continue. Get out my Trigonometry
books, and must really try to master that problem, or I shall never
get an Entrance Scholarship at Cambridge. Feel so dizzy!
Afterwards.—They took me off to the Hospital, it seems, where I
had brain-fever, complicated with rupture ot the right cardiac ven-
tricle. The Trigonometry produced the brain-fever, and the Calis-
thenics the other disease. Now, five weeks after, am still painfully
weak. Doctor says I shall never be fit for any mental or physical
exertion to speak of. Father (I regret to say) swears at Doctor, and
says I must stop " all that dratted book-larnin," and cany up his
bricks "on a hod." And so ends my dream of Trinity Cofiege,

ÎÏ ROBERT ON HEREDITARY LEGISLATION.
I SPENT a lezzur~ evening, just about a month ago, in a reading of
a wuaderfool emusing but most rude speech of that howdacious
Mr. LA i; I:YMI кл к, all about what is called, I bleeve, heredity legis-
lashun, which means, I am told, that every Pier's heldest son shall
be a Pier when his father dies, weather he s fit for it or weather he
ain't, weather he 's a genus or weather he 's a Fool, weather he 's a
onest man or weather ,-^ВВъ« ^e'8 a -^"S116' Well, it
suttenly does, at the oB% first blush, seem а гауши
rum way to get the У'(ЯрИ ^es' PeePle f°r the bizzi-
ness, but, as the late /&SJOE?3 laminttd Mr. MAKWOOD
used to say, I allus judges
by results, and to nr
mind the results is good,
and good all round. It

seems good for the Country, as we seems to have dun pretty well
considering wot a lot on us there is. BEOWN says as there 's ever so
manv millions of us, but BROW» does ex ad gerate so. It seems good
for the Harrystockracy, as I 'm told as werry few of our grate fam-
merlies ever dyes out, and having to purwide for their next suns
and hairs they don't make quite so menny dux and drakes of their
munny as they wood posserbly do if their suns wasn't for to be
Dooks and Markisses and Barren Lords like their Fathers.
Werry well, then, if it's right, and good, and natra], that Piers'
suns shood be Piers, why shoudn't Waiters' suns be Waiters? .Why
am I a Waiter? Coz my father was a Waiter before me. It's
instinct as does it, and that same nobel quality is alreddy a showing
itself in one of my boys, and this is how it fust showed itself, as we
says of the meesels, eteetterer.
His Mother bort him a box of bilding-toys for his berth-day
pressent, and during my absense wun day, he bilt bisself an house
with 'em, and jist as I quietly hentered the room, he was a painting
on it Rpsterong, Dining Rooms! I was that afected by the hintrest-
ing suckemstance, that I gave him a new penny right off, with witch
he went out and bort hisself a jam tart, and gave his littel Sister the
fust bite out of the middel, an amount of self sackrifice as ony boys
can foolly realize.
I 'm told as the same nobel instinct shows itself amung the City
Scawengers, that most useful and admirabble body of men. Dreckly
as aTScawenger's sun atains the ripe age of 13, and has conseqwently
finished his eddecashun, he becomes a Street Orderly, and receives
the and sura sum of seven shillins a week, paid weekly, every week,
and a white unyform, and the nat'ral objeck of his perspiring
ambition is to become a Long-Broom Lad, witch he does at the
blooming age of about 18, and for witch he receives the libra! amount
of about fifteen shillings, paid weakly ewery week as before. But
ewen then he has his giddy hopes of sumthink hier—like the yung
man as tried to clime up the Mounting a singing Hexsellseor—and
the wun object of his future egsistence is to becum in time a full-
blown Scawenger, with a revenue of no less than 25». a week, payahel
weakly, like his useful Father before him. Wot a histery! and how
confermatory of the grate principal of heredditty legislashun,
and how completely it hupsete Mr. LABBYSHAKE s howdacious
reasoning.
To be sure it doesn't allers anser. There was a case as I herd of,
not quite a thowsand miles from tooth-drawing Fleet Street, where a
sillybrated dentist having dyed quite sudden, his Sun-in-Law con-
tinued the bizzyness, tho he knowd no more about it than I do. It
was all werry well with the pore littel ohildern, and even the ladys,
who has siten wunderfopl faith in us of the sterner sex, submitted to
their scrunching fate without much more nor the usual trubble, pore
deers, but one day a rather hasty and werry powerfool Gent came in
to have a tooth out, and most unfortnetly for the young Dentist, he
seized tight hold of a tooth, and dragged the Gent rite round the
room afore he got it out, and then he found as it was the rong un!
I am sorry to say as the Gent used most unproper langwidge, and,
locking the door, swore as he 'd throw the pore Dentist out of the
winder if he didn't give him twenty pound, and he was so terrebly
f ritened that he acshally did it, and even then the Gent went away
a cussing and a swearing! But then that was scarsely a case in pint,
beooz we never hears of hereditty Sons-in-Law, no more nor we does
of hereditty Mothers-in-Law, witch upon the hole is praps quite as
well. ROBBET.
AT THE SEA.
WHEN August has come, and
when London
Is dull since the Season is o'er,
When folks find the balls and the
fun done,
They fly to the sea and the
shore:
They leave all the city's miasma
To go where salt breezes blow
free,
And where av^piBiíov y4\afff¿a
Is seen on the sea.
They sail on the shimmering
Solent,
Their yachts woo the favouring
wind,
Perchance, too, in boats as we
know lent
By friends who are pleased to
be kind.
Ah! once in the stern-sheets there
sata
Sea-siren whose voice van-
quished me,
The Queen of the famous regatta
At Cowes, by the sea.
If gaily they go where fair ladies
Assemble to chatter and dress.
The aim of the man and the maid is
To be in the thick of the press.
And pio-nio and fun. and flirtation
Are never, so all folks a^ree,
So pleasant in this generation
As down by the sea.
Or haply they '11 seek out ,'somo
quiet
Wee nook by the marge of the
waves.
Afar from the roar and the riot
Where Fashion inveigles her
slaves,
In joy they will cry out aloud,
f'Let
The world be forgotten, for we
Want nought but the shore and
the cloudlet,
And cy aniñe sea!"
Then haste to the 'sea-side,* no
matter
To whatever coast you incline;
Get rid of Society's clatter,
Or go there to dance and to
dine.
There's health in the breeze on
the ripple,
The air is the true eau de vie,
And better by far than that
tipple,
e wind from the sea.
THE POETRY OF MOTION.
THE other day Mr. and Mrs. RUSSELL, of America, undertook to
lecture upon Dramatic Action at Drury Lane. Mr. RUSSELL presented
somewhat the appearance of a foreign waiter, and began by asking
"Who was DF.LSAETE?" Nobndy in the audience seemed prepared
to enlighten him. So the lecturer answered himself. DELSAETE was
originally a Parisian çamin. He hung about the stage-doors of
theatres, vainly attempting to "see Managers." Mr. RUSSELL
touched some of the Dramatic artists who were present by observ-
ing :—" Many of you know how much more difficult it is to get in at
the back-door than at the front." (Is it possible that the lecturer
bas been to the Savoy, and attempted to "sf-e " Mr. D'OYLY CARTE ?)
A.t last opportunity came to the boy, as it will to him who waits—our
ROBERT nas had splendid opportunities—and after a d¿but,a.t which
the assistants came to jeer, but remained to cheer, M. DKI.SAHTE
found himself the idol of Paris. Then he turned his attention to
Anatomy, and made a discovery in connection with thumbs. In all
corpses hi; t'oi nd the thumb turned inwards. But in the Great
Masters' pictures the thumbs are all quite straight. "Where,"
asked Mr. RUSSELL, with fine effect, "were those pictures painted?
On the battle-field, among the heaps of slain P No. In studios from
uving models, or perhaps from mere lay-figures." (Sensation.)
Mrs. RUSSELL, gracefully attired in a creamy tea-gown, "followed
on the same side." She advocated the study of Nature among
actors, and insisted on more use being made of the shoulder, which
she considered an expressive feature of the human frame. The
actor is apt to neglect it, but he should put his shoulder to the wheel
and infuse more animation and warmth into it. Mrs. RUSSELL
could not bear the idea of a cold shoulder. But she is never likely to
jet it. Both parts of the entertainment were interesting and in-
structive, though the audience was not so largeos it might have been
at another season of the year.

SIB,—A Scotch Tourist has been writing to a daily paper, com-
plaining bitterly of the unpunctuality of the three great Companies
daily running their trains to the North, the latter reaching their
destination sometimes fully two hours after the advertised time, and
on the particular occasion to which he refers depositing him at
2 ;'.() P.M. on the Perth platform, where he had apparently to pass
the night in what he characterises as a scene of indescribable confu-
sion " of men, women, and children, sportsmen with dogs, servants,
all rushing about inquiring eagerly about the next train, and with
only one result, that they would have to pass the remainder of the
night in cold waiting-rooms." Surely the remedy for this state of
things is in the Scotch Tourist's own hands. He has only to provide
against the contingency by taking with him a three-foot-six flock
mattress, a bolster and feather pillow, two blankets, a "moderator,"
small circulating library, and Model Victorian Cooking-Stove, and
he will find himself quite prepared to pass the night comfortably on
Perth platform, or anywhere else. If so inclined, ne may also throw
in the bagpipes; that will enable him. if he can perform creditably
on the instrument, to enliven the small hours of the morning.
While the unusual pressure on the traffic continues, I can only
recommend everybody making for the Highland line to follow the
example of Yours circumspectly,

its limits, and its seasons.
The foregoing is merely a hint as to what variations I could play
on such a theme.
My immediate answer to my friends is that, "I am ordered to go
there." This sounds better than "recommended," as implying
that my departure for Royat is a matter of vital importance to
myself and also to my friends. So I speak as if I were a soldier,
"ordered off at a moment's notice, to take the field."—a phrase which
is more suggestive of the betting man than the soldier—and I expect
my friends to accept this as sufficiently explaining why I choose
Royat in preference to Vichy, Aix-les-Bains, La Bourboule, Mont-
Doré, Homburg, Luchon, or any other watering-place. They have,
all of them, the air of resenting my choice of Royat as a personal
affront to them individually and collectively; or if not exactly as a
personal affront, at least as showing on my part a want of con-
sideration for their feelings. If they do not mean this, why does my
old friend HOLDTTM, lunching at his table by the Club window,
exclaim with an appearance of surprise, and in an injured tone,
"Why Royat P" and turn away to look out of the window, as if my
conduct, was too painful for Viim to trust himself even to regard me
one moment longer without weeping.
Why does Том UNDEBLEEP, whom I only see to speak to for a few
minutes on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, when he is waiting furtively
in the Club hall to waylay the new number of the World or Truth,
and, so to speak, get the first out at it before it has become as stale
as the caviare which was opened for some one a fortnight ago; why.
I ask, does Том UNDERLEEP, to whom it can matter nothing where I
go or what I do, suddenly take upon himself to look up from his Truth
or World, and growl in a discontented manner, "Why do you go to
Royat P" as though he had already made up his mind to go there
himself, and was afraid there wouldn't be room for both of us?
That those of my medical acquaintance who are interested in other
health-resorts, should strongly advise their particular fancies, was
to be expected; but that my familiar friends should be hurt bv the
announcement of my resolution of visiting Royat, seems to call for
gome preliminary explanation of my apparently, to them, strange
conduct; for they look askance at me as if, when I am out of the
room, they will tap their foreheads significantly, muttering, "Poor
chap! something wrong in this quarter" (meaning my head) —
"going to Royat 1 Must be off his nut!" and so on. Well, this is
my explanation :—
Happening one day to be having a scientific chat with my friend,
Dr. POTTENEY—HAMMOND PUTTENEY, M.D., the well-known author
of that brochure which created such a sensation in society about three
years ago. entitled How to get Fat in Two Minutes, and even more
celebrated in the medical and scientific world through his learned
treatises on The Unnecessary Fabrication of Vital Tissue (25th
Thousand), On the Treatment of Vehicular Disease on the Lower
Lugnosi» (50th Thousand), Ом Vicarious Phiningitis of the Assimi-
lated Cuíteles (with Diagrams in Colours—8th Edition, Revised anc
Corrected by the Author), and, I should add, famed in the French
German, and Italian Schools of Medicine, for his brilliant discovery
of the Clignotic Movement of the Nervous Tegocular Membrane
which has already revolutionised the treatment of this mysterious
aechanism in the human frame, which is now known among the
¡"acuity as "PCTTENEY'S Membrane "—happening to be chatting with
)r. PÜTTENEY about his own state of health, which was puzzling
dm considerably, and, incidentally, about my own, he suddenly
onkcd up, and said with an air of the deepest conviction, "There's
inlyone place for you,—Royat!"
When Dr. HAMMOND PDTTENEY, sitting easily on a garden-chair,—
,hat is, as easily as it is possible to sit on a garden-chair,—enjoying a
)ig cigar, suddenly brings his knees sharply together, jerks his body
>olt upright, adjusts his spectacles with his left hand, while in his

right he takes his cigar (which he thenceforth uses as if it were a
piece of chalk, and he were a lecturer drawing a diagram on an
invisible black-board, and emphasing his discourse with it), he is
immediately transformed from a round-yisaged jolly looking person,
a compromise between a young English Squire and a superior
German Student (after a series of soap-and-water baths) who was
wearing his Professor's gold-rimmed spectacles for a lark, to the
respectable English scientific, professional practitioner of several
years standing,—and, I am bound to say, the metamorphosis is as
astounding as it is complete and entire.
His manner is earnest, his action energetic, and his speech deter-
mined, a combination which would give a tone of severity to any
other man, but not to Dr. PÜTTENEY, whose hair, what there is of it,
is very light and thin, and whose features guiltless of any sign of
moustache, beard, or whiskers, more nearly resemble those of the
conventional cherub, than any other variety of the human physiognomy
with which I am acquainted.
There was "once upon a time," a learned person, a Doctor, not of
medicine, but of divinity, who was distinguished as " The Angelic
Doctor." I feel inclined to borrow a hint from this title, and christen
Dr. PDTTENEY " The Cherubic Doctor." I would not wish it to be
thought that I adopt all the consequences of this simile, as Cherubs
are usually represented on tombstones as blowing trumpets,
presumably their own; and I am bound to say that this is a sort of
thing Dr. HAMMOND PUTTENEY never does. If he blows trumpets at
all, they are not his own instruments, but those of his friends, and
these he blows loudly. To-day,—the day this dialogue takes place,—
he sounds the Royat trumpet, and plays upon it a marvellously
fascinating tune; so much so indeed, that my Cousin JANE at once
agrees with him, that Royat is the place for me, Dr. PUTTENBY
having long ago settled that she, as his patient, was to go there before
the London season was over.
"You must go," cries Mrs. DINDEELTN, enthusiastically. She is
also under Dr. PUTTENBY'S orders. "It has done me such a lot of
good every year." She is a pale diaphonous lady with a rather
high-pitched voice, and quick incisive manner of speaking that will
not brook contradiction.
"It does everyone good," cuts in Dr. PUTTENEY, authoritatively,
evidently not wishing to go into such useless details as to the nature
of the aumente from which his various patients, for whom he has
prescribed, or is prescribing, Royat, are suffering. "It does every
one good, and," turning to me, "it'll do you good especially—and
so you '11 go—and I '11 get your rooms, and see you all through your
treatment, and you'll start with your cousin, who is off next
Saturday, and I leave to-morrow. So that 's settled ; " and, dropping
the character of the Cherubic Doctor, he proceeds to throw himself
back in his chair, kicks up his legs on to another chair, lights a fresh
cigar, and with his face wreathed in smiles, he is once more trans-
formed into the hearty boyish young English Squire, who has been
spending a year among thi German Students, and is wearing, always
for a lark, his Professor's gold-rimmed spectacles.

PUNCH, OE THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I have one short interview on our way home from the Richmond
Club; it is in that garden the memorable conversation takes place
•which decides me. To Royat I go. And so I sinç with Cousin JANE
the duet from Manon, which I adapt to the occasion—
"À Koyat,
Nous irons.
Tous lea doux, tous les deux!"
The second line is, curiously enough, very suggestive of the waters
of Koyat, if irons" were pronounced as in English. There is plenty
of '¿«и»." not " in the fire," but in the water of Royat. For the rest
of the week we have "Waters on the brain," and we cannot quote
the line as applicable to our case (mine and JANE'S)—" Eaux ! no, we
never mention them!" for we are perpetually talking about them.
Either Cousin JANE is calling on me, or I on .1 лл- г. Her husband
can t go with her, but he holds out some hopes of his just looking
m, that is if, as I understand him, he finds Royat is on his way to
Scotland, where he has to go on particular business, not unconnected
(I fancy, though, I wouldn't make mischief for the world) with a
fishing-rod and gun. But no matter. I am to take care of JANE,
(who, between ourselves is of an age to be perfectly able to take care
of herself) and her husband has only to see her off at the Station,
confide her to my care, (why can't he come himself P he had said he
would and then changed his mind) and that of Dr. PÜTTENEY as
medical attendant at Royat, and pay the bills. So Dr. PÜTTENEY
precedes us with some other patients including the diaphonous
Mrs. DINDEHLIN, giving himself a week's start in order (it is very
kind of him) to have everything ready for our reception.
TRYING IT ON IN TIREE.

wee bit merry wi' it, and
now (exuUingly) ivery night
I 'm altegither unable to dis-
cern the kirk from the tavern,

First B. S. Ha, ha, ho!
To think the Government
should be sic fules as to send three hundred men to coairce the puir
peaceable bodies of crofters in Tirée I
Second B. S. Ah, we 've drawn a gnde prize this time, and no
mistek. The sodjers are just swarmin' aboot, and payiu' in gude
English gold—none o' your dirty pun notes—and sic a time for the
Fleeher, and the Grocer, and for sellin' our beasties' and our milk,
and pur fegitibles, as was ne'er seen!
First B. S. 'Twas a rare trick, spreadin' the report about the
desprit resistance,"—eh, SANDY ?—that would be met wi'
Second B. S. And the deforoin* that puir sheriff body. Well,
they '11 likely mek ain or twa o' us pay for that; but I '11 no mind a
month in an Edinbro' gaol, and it 's a sma' price for having the
sodjers in Tirée; and I 've ne'er set een on Edinbro' in a' my life, and
I '11 be gay and glad to gang there.
First B. S. (contemplatively). Perhaps next simmer, SANDY,
they '11 send a decent Hielan' regiment, wi' the boys and the bag-
pipes; and then our cup would be just full! But there'в the
Marines patrollin'—we'd better saiperate—but who'11 say the Scot

In-waded.
OUR EXCHANGE AND MART.
SPECULATIVE AND EXPERIMENTAL.— A gentleman of
refined and cultivated tastes, who has devoted many years of
life and the bulk of a large fortune to the perfecting of a machine,
of which he is the proprietary inventor, for the cutting and curling
of hair by machinery, is anxious to dispose of the entire apparatus
(which is guaranteed as in effective operative condition, though not
quite in perfect and reliable working order), together with all the
patent rights attaching thereto. Would be found serviceable in a
Lunatic Asylum or other kindred Institution, where thorough and
vigorous head-shaving happened to be an object, or might be utilised
at a cheap Restaurant for peeling pumpkins. Can be seen, and it»
operation personally experienced, by any intending purchaser, who
should come provided with his own sticking-plaster, at any hour
daily, at the present residence of the Proprietor, 370, New Cut.
M~ ARINE IÑVESTMENT.-A COAL~BARGE to be disposed
of. A Country Clergyman who has, under the will of a
distant relative, recently come into possession of one of these useful
and effective river carriers, but having failed in his effort to have it
transported inland,' and utilised in the only way possible to him,
namely, to serve, inverted, as a roof to the chancel of his new church,
is anxious to meet with a member '.of the yachting fraternity, or
some enterprising person of nautical proclivities, willing to take it
off his hands. Clipper-rigged, and supplied with a slight plank-
deck, it would afford a capital and roomy pleasure-boat to an inde-
fatigable amateur who wished to take a few friends on a slow, but
safe, holiday cruise among the'reaches of the upper Thames; while,
if papered neatly, with a window knocked in its side, it might, in
its present position, high and dry on a mud-flat at Barking, furnish
an excellent substitute for a house-boat to any eccentric recluse to
whom change of scene and situation on the river was no immediate
object. Could, with certain alterations, be started as a Sunday
excursion-steamer, or serve as a target for marine artillery praotice.
No reasonable offer refused. — Address, the Rev. , fchoalam
Vicarage, Mudwater.
TO INVALID SPORTSMEN. EXTRAORDINARY OPPOR-
TUNITY,—The Laird of a small portion of a Highland Glen,
who is leaving it for domestic reasons, is willing to let it forth with to
a careful tenant together with all the deer-stalking and salmon-
fishing tobe found upon the estate. Owing to the recent dryness of
the weather, there is at present no water in the stream, but twenty
miles further down the Glen, a fine 31b. salmon trout was seen
last year, and it is reasonably calculated that if there is a steady
down-pour in any season, he will be likely to mount and possibly
show some sport higher up. Though the deer in the Glen is repre-
sented at present by an ancient stag who is lame and blind of one eye,
it is confidently expected that if suddenly frightened by the blowing
of a post-horn or other device, he might turn tail and allow himself
to be properly "stalked." The place, however, offers peculiar advan-
tages to an invalid, who though confined to his bath-chair, and too
feeble to handle a gun or a rod, wishes to indulge in the temporary
excitement of meeting the Monarch of the Glen quite amicably, or of
waiting for a week or two to witness a riie at a salmon-ladder. By
letter to the MACSHABBIE, Glen Frolich, Perthshire, N.B.
TO CRICKETERS AND OTHERS.—A Yorkshire Baronet, who
takes a great interest in the development of the national game,
having conceived and carried out the idea of collecting a Cannibal
Eleven for the purpose of pitting them in the field against celebrated
English and County teams, but only having partially succeeded in
initiating them in the rules usually observed in a regulation match,
is desirous of meeting with an experienced wild-beast tamer, who will
be prepared to act as Captain, and take them in hand. Though, on the
whole, fairly behaved in public, as when, on the " in" side, they can
only be restrained from all going in at once by the free and frequent use
of a leaded horsewhip, and, when taking the field, invariably attempt
to scalp the Umpire, and eat the wicket-keeping gloves, it will be
seen that any one applying for the post must Ъе not only thoroughly
well up in the laws of the game, but prepared to act with prompti-
tude amd vigour when they are in the least degree called in queinon.
As. in their first appearance in the field last week against "АД
Uffingham," they burst into a war-whoop in the course of the flr»t
innings, drove the rival Eleven to seek a nasty refuge up the varióme
trees in the ground, and, finally making a bonfire of the wicketi,
lunched off the scoring-paper, their patron is anxious that, in their
second and forthcoming engagement with "Eleven Gentlemen of
Yorkshire," they should conduct themselves rather more in accord-
ance with the established usages of Cricket. He, therefore, will be
glad to receive an early reply to the above Advertisement, and
will undertake to supplv thongs, strait-waistcoats, tiger-pincers,
manacles, leg-chains, and all other apparatus that may be deemed
necessary to turning them out a respectable team, who will play
fairly well together.—Apply, stating terms, to Baronet, Catcham
Court, Yorkshire.

THOSE YELLOW SANDS!"
Тнв BROWNS DEPART FOR THE SEA-SIDK, то THE WISTFUL ADMIRATION OF THEIR LESS FORTUNATB NEIGHBOURS.
1 YOUTH ON THE PROW AND PLEASURE AT THE HELM."
".FAIR laughs the Morn, and soft the Zephyr blows,
While proudly rising: o'er the azure realm
In gallant trim the gilded Yessel goes,
Youth on the prow and Pleasure at the helm:
Regardless of the sweeping Whirlwind's sway,
That, hushed in grim repose, expects his evening prey."
Prophetic GBAY! Thy proud Pindaric lyre
In true Cassandra spirit thou didst handle,
"And with a Master's hand and Prophet's Ure,"
Held to posterity a seer-like candle,
Which casts a curious illumination
Upon the present puzzling Party situation.
The morn laughs fair, and at the painted prow
Triumphant Youth is cutting happy capers;
No clouds of forethought darken that bold brow;
Has he not "chucked " the croakers and red-tapers?
And, after such a launch and such a rally,
Shall he admit the ominous Rayen to thin galley?
The azure realm affords a jolly " swim,"
There 's nothing to impede, or check, or shackle.
The gilded Vessel is in gallant trim,
And isn't his bold grasp upon the tackle?
The Vessel slides—Yeo-ho, lads! Pulley-hauly !—
As smoothly as a lay by lyrical MACATTLAT.
Vogue la galère! He always felt that he—
Although a Captain scarce beyond the boy age—
Was from his birth intended for the sea,
And now he's bent upon a prosperous voyage.
He fears not rock or reef, or blast or thunder,
And holds that only gangs of used up buffers blunder.
As for the helmsman,—well, he too looks gay,
Lounging beside his tiller as at leisure,
Yet it, perchance, were premature to say
He quite fulfils the poet's type of Pleasure.
He knows a bit about the Whirlwind's force,
And is not quite so coolly cocksure of his course.
Youth at the'prow has not the slightest doubt,
He looks as oockawhoop as a Cheap Tripper.
".Bless you 1 " winks he, I know what I'm about.
I only wish that I, not he, were skipper.
But whilst I trim the sails and watch the compass,
He cannot go far wrong, so I '11 not raise a rumpus."
He at the helm had better keep his eye
Upon that Whirlwind " hushed in grim repose"
On the horizon now, but ever nigh;
And when it next may thunder forth who knows?
"Sufficient for the day its ill however."
The helmsman thinks, "And, after all, the Urchin's clever!"
BRITANNIA REDIVIVA.
NAVAL affairs appear to be looking up at last. The launching of
the fast cruiser, Orlando, from a private yard on the Tyne, aptly re-
minds the British tax-payer that the Authorities have taken a step
in the right direction, inasmuch as building to the extent of three
and a half millions has been similarly placed out, and is at this
moment actively in hand. Then the present Government, however
they may manage the ship of State, look very like doing good
business with the Navy. If Lord GBOEOE HAMILTON, who began
well last year, wants to spend his money judiciously, let him get a
Royal Commission to help him, for, with "СнАЕЬЕг" BERBSFOBD
as his colleague, whose energetic presence at the Board is enough to
wake up "my Lords," and set them all vigorously dancing the
Hornpipe, he is not likely to come to a standstill for want either of
spirit or enterprise. Then there is the Secretary. Mr. FOHWOOD,
who, whether he is practically for wood or for steel in construction,
is admitted to be very much to the fore from a business point of view,
and likely to prove an important factor in the general efficiency of
the deoartment. On the whole, the prospect is encouraging.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SEE THE C. C. C.!

LAW! Yes, and the Dignity of Justice! A Prison and a Court House!
The centre of the Universe! Well may; it be called the Old Bailey—a name
which seems to be synonymous with familiarity—nay contempt! When is it to
end? How long must Mr. Punch tolerate one of the worst scandals of the day?
Who is that unfortunate creature hustled by a rough and foul-mouthed
mob, insulted by a barbarous constabulary, fined by a relentless official? Why.
a person who an hour later (if he gets into the hall of Justice) will be addressed
with the greatest courtesy by a Judge amongst the Minnows (or say a Triton
amongst the Aldermen) as a "Gentleman of the Jury!" A pleasant way of
treating a man of birth and breeding! A delightful introduction to grave
judicial duties! Perhaps the Gentleman may be going to decide a question
literally of life and death. It is possible that within the hour the existence
of a fellow-creature may depend upon his fiat. Laughed at on every side, the
Juryman will push his way to the box of judgment, and unnerved by much
abuse, and dazed with hard crushing, will be called upon for the Verdict. A
nice frame of mind in which to ponder the dread answer, "Guilty !" or " Not
Guilty!" Why, after all the ill-usage he will have undergone, he will be
better fitted for the curative; treatment of that happy refuge for the mentally
afflicted, the Flower House,.Catford, than a seat in the Jury Box at the Old
Bailey! But what does that matter? Twelve good men and true will have
been gathered together and brought up smiling and scowling (as their case
may be) to listen to the arguments of the counsel, the evidence of the witnesses,
ana the iudge's summing-up! There they are, "Ready, aye ready," and what

does it matter what "discipline" they may have undergone in the crowded
and dirty passages of the wretched Court, so long as they appear when wanted?
So much for the Jury, the Gentlemen of the Jury, the Martyrs of the Jury I
After all, they are men, and " caa behave as such." But when it comes to^the
Ladies I Then the anger of Mr. Punch rises to fever-
heat, and, had he his way, he would take his broom, and,
assisted by artistic Toby, holding the lantern of experi-
ence, make a clean sweep of it! Talk of City improve-
ments! What improvement can there be when the
heart of the City is cancered to the core? Fine streets,
handsome building*, and a Court-House a disgrace to
civilisation!
If the Juryman has cause for complaint, what must be
the grievance of
the unfortunate
lady bound to
give hostile evi-
dence relative
to a burglar or
a street-thief?
Forced into a
room where the
friends and re-
latives of the
prisoner sur-
round ,her,
knowing her
mission, kept
waiting amidst
jeers and, per-
chance, even
threats, for
hours without
redress! She
appeals to a
constable, and
she is met with
a laugh; she
seeks to escape,

and
sternly ordered back! And
seated in the same building, clothed in the meaningless
finery of scarlet robes and golden chains, are the Fathers
of the City calmly doing nothing until the time arrives
for them to indulge in a heavy lunch or a sleepy drive
home to the suburbs!
What more can Mr. Punch say? What more can he
do? Pen and pencil to the attack! Will the combined
forces wake the consciences of the City King and his col-
leagues? It is to be doubted! Years ago Mr. Punch
suggested that a Director should be seated in front of
the engine to every excursion-train, as a preventive to
railway accidents. Why not cause every Alderman to
serve, incognito, on the Jury, and everyAlderman's wife
to run, unknown, the gauntlet of the Witnesses' Room?
Were this done, perhaps reform might follow. But no;
turtle at the Mansion House is better than inqairy, and
balls at the Guildhall more amusing than redress!
Fancy BUMBLE Master of the situation! BUMBLE
the representative of Justice, the outcome of the City's
wealth! And the stronghold of BUMBLE is called the
C. C. C.! Mysterious initials. What do they really mean?
Crass and Contemptible Cruelty? Certainly. Corrupt
and Callous Carelessness? Again certainly—why not?
So Mr. Punch once more wields his broom, and demands,
with the utmost severity, his rights, and the rights of the
people. Licence has had its day, it 's time for law! Law,
Gentlemen of the House of Commons! Law, Peers in
"the other place." Law, Your MAJESTY! Law!
Colourable.
BRAVO, Mr. SPEAKEB! How proud you muet feel.
The Bufi and the Blue
Seem contented with you;
Nor does Protestant Orange protest against PEEL!
"!N MEMORIAM."—Why this heading, prefixed, at
the foot of a newspaper Obituary, to an intimation which
first appeared a year, or several years ago? For some
good reason, doubtless—never mind what. A corre-
sponding announcement, for the perusal of those whom it
may concern, might be appended to a list of " Marriages."
As :—" On this day twelvemonth (or a date still earlier),

CASH AND CREDIT.
À PROPOS of "The Last Shopkeeper. A Tale of the Dim and
Distant Future," which lately appeared in his pages (No. 2350, p. 45).
Mr. Punch has received the following, among many other letters :—
1)i:.ui MB. PUNCH,
WHEN I read your very pathetic account of "The Last
Shopkeeper," I was moved almost to tears, and felt as though I
had lost, or at least was within measurable distance of losing, an old
and dear friend. The Retail Shopkeeper has indeed been to me, in-
termittently perhaps, but very really, what the poet calls " a pleasant
boon." To him, on those not rare occasions when I have expended
all my ready cash with the Co-operative Stores attached to the
branch of the Public Service which I grace, to him, I say, it has been
my habit to resort for commodities, and—well in point of fact for
credit. The motto of the Stores you see is that of Mr». Gamp, "I
gives no trust myself." It is their only drawback, but a somewhat
serious one nevertheless, when funds are low and pay-day is still
remote. On such occasions I call and see my old ana tried—very
much tried—friend the Shopkeeper, whom I find a real good fellow
in such emergencies. Our friendship, like our other relations, is of
long-standing, and the very thought of losing him for good and all,
in the dismal but definite fashion shadowed forth in your touching
story, is terrible to me.
Ah, Sir, let us comfort the Shopkeeper with our sympathy, let us
encourage him with our occasional custom, let us even aid mm now
and again with a modest payment on account, rather than risk the
incalculably uncomfortable consequences—to us as well as to him—
of his incurring the wretched fate of the doomed JOHN JORKER.
Yours very truly, TAIBOT A. ÏKNTEUFORK.
P.S.—Disgusting!!! Mr. Punch, mil you believe it? I have
just received the most impertinent letter from a miserable pettifog-
ging Shopkeeper, who has the audacity to tell me, one of Her
Majesty's trusted— save by him — Servants, and that in no measured
language, that my account with him, a paltry hundred pounds, has
been running for three years, that he must and will have it settled,
and that he will not supply me with any more goods until it is paid!!!
And I must pocket that insult from a low, soulless, white-aproned
épicier, because — well, in point of fact because at the moment 1 have
nothing else to pocket. I am stumped: all our fellows are more or

wonderful spirits, and really a good fellow.
GLADSTONE came in at half-past one. Gazed with surprise at
two hats at end of Front Opposition Bench, one white the other
black, "Belong to some of my young men, I suppose," he said,
though there was an uneasy look in his eye. Presently CHAMBER-
LAIN came in, and taking up the black hat, put it on his head
and sat down. Later HENEAGE claimed the white hat, and sat on
Front Bench. HAETDÎGTOJÎ coming in a little late, appropriated
third seat.
"Delighted to"see"you, my Lord and Gentlemen," said GLAD-
STONE, shaking hands heartily with them. "Glad to have you
back again in the fold. Nothing like a united family. Some talk
about your going to sit below the Gangway, or among the Tories.
But here you are, under the old umbrella once more. Very nice
of you."
HARTINGTON evidently wanted to say something in reply.
CHAMBERLAIN hastily prepared a few remarks; but GLADSTONE,
turning aside, began talking to HENRT FOWIEE, leaving them no
opportunity.

MISUNDERSTOOD;
OR, "HOW IT STRIKES A STRANGER."
THE nation of Nullibia was much behind the age;
It had never seen an Actor, and it did not boast a Stage!
An unsophisticated race, ingenuous and simple,
Whose mirth was as spontaneous as old Ocean's sunny dimple.
They basked in Nature's beauty, though they 'd never had a B.USKDÎ,
And they found life most amusing, though ungraced by sock ana
buskin.
They looked on it without a thought of histrionic mocking;
A state of abject ignorance exceptionally shocking.
One morning in Nullibia a pallid man appeared,
With abnormal length of tresses and dehciency of beard.
Nullibia had never seen a man so closely shaven,
In gait so like an ostrich, or in guise so like a raven;
Ала they cried, "0 ghastly Stranger, stop! Nullibia quite secure is.
Why stride you like Orestes? Are you hunted by the Furies?"
Then the Stranger stopped instanter, with the funniest of jerks,
As though something had gone wrong upon a sudden with his works.
And with curious blub and gurgle, like Geneva from a bottle,
Words which no man comprehended flowed from forth his spectral
throttle. [guggles?
And they cried, "0 pallid Stranger, why these painful gug-gug-
Are they signs of suffocation, or severe internal struggles P"
Then his vertebrie they patted where they angularly hollowed,
As a nurse does with, an infant who a crumb of bread hath swal-
lowed.
But instead of showing symptoms of appreciative gratitude,
He appeared about to strike them,—but he only struck an attitude.
He crooked his spectral fingers, and he hunched his bony shoulders,
In a way that nearly petrified the wondering beholders.
And one oritd, "0 pallid Stranger, I would be your benefactor,
But oh, what the dickens are you?" He responded, "I'm an
Actor!!!"
And his optics flamed like torches. It was simply Artist's vanity,
But they quite misunderstood it—they mistook it for insanity.
And one whispered to another, "Ah, poor soul! don't raise a racket,
But just try and keep him quiet while I run for a strait-jacket."
Then one asked, " What is an Actor?" Though he spake in accents
gentle,
They appeared to cause the Stranger torments physical and mental;
For he shrieked in shrill falsetto, and he tore his garments madly,
And the people sadly murmured, "He has got them very badly."
"Gracious powers I " groaned the Stranger, "this is worse than
Yokohama.
Do you really mean to tell me that you haven't got a Drama?"
Now the people of Nullibia of fine courtesy were modtle,
So they only looked compassionate and gravely shook their noddles.
Then the Stranger grovelled low, and inarticulately gurgled.
Like a man whose wife has bolted, or whose mansion has been
burgled:
So they said "If you 're an Actor"—and they only spoke to humour
him—
"Pray act, and let us see it." Then there came a tragic gloom o'er
He tossed his mane of tresses like an epileptic lion [him,
(Whilst the stalwart local Constables his action kept an eye on),
And he straddled like a land-crab with a shambling sideway
action,
(Whilst the ladies of Nullibia looked on in stupefaction),
And his voice sunk to his midriff in a ventriloquia! fashion
(Till the matrons of Nullibia were melted to compassion),
And he clutched his crumpled shirt-front with a visage blaok and
scowling,
And ejaculated fiercely with a high hysteric howling,
And he hissed and groaned, and gurgled, and he mopped, and mowed,
and muttered,
But they could not catch the meaning of a single word he uttered.
And they cried, "Oh, is this acting?" He replied, "It is, for
certain;
And you'll now just please imagine that I'm called before the
Curtain."
Then he smirked upon them blandly as a histrionic hero,
Just as TACITUS informs ия was the habitude of NEEO;
And he swore that their affection was the source of all beatitude,
And he maundered of his heart-strings, and he gushed about his
gratitude.
He laehrymosely ladled out a lot of school-girl drivel,
And their loyalty he lauded till he seemed about to snivel.
He must leave them.for a fortnight, he remarked; the wrench
was cruel.
But the fire of their affection should not fail for want of fuel.
Ho would ne'er forget that moment; let them still keep up their
pecker;
He was happy in his Art, and in the state of his Exchequer.
And a further opportunity their souls should shortly flatter
Of worshipping the former, and replenishing the latter.
He loved them, oh, he loi-ed them, every Man and Miss and Madam,
Though ninety-five per cent, of them he did not know from Adam.
But the Artist's heart 's capacious, as capacious as his pocket.—
Here his eve began revolving, like a beacon, in its socket,
And he yelled, Where arc the bouquets, and why don't you rise
and bellow?
Will no curses à la Claudian. will no apinçs of Othello,
Will no posturings like Clito s, will no facial twists infernal,
Will no blend of Ancient Miller and the modern London Journal,
Move your frigid souls to frenzy? Gug-gug-gug "But here
they stopped him,
And in a padded chamber they incontinently popped him.
AN occasional want of animation may be excused in a Clergyman,
who reflects that he is only addressing Lay figures.

ROBERT AT MARLOW.
WBATHEB it was brort on by the wunderfool kindness and horse-
pitalerty of my Colonial and Injean frends at the Colinderiee, witch
was as continual and as agreeabel as their jollity and good temper,
or weather it was from my good nature in trying my werry best to
like their Austraylion wines, as the best way to show my grattitood,
I don't of course know, but, not feeling werry well, I consulted my
Fammerly Feesician, at the Free Horsepital, and being reckomended
by him perfect rest, and change of hair, and change of seen, and
plane living, for a rayther sharp atack of what us City Waiters calls
the Livery complaint, as so many of the Masters and Wardens of
Livery Companys suffers from it, I did not hezzitate for a minnit,
but decided at wunce to rewisit gentlemenly " Great Marlow," the
same as I did larst year, so "Here we are agane!" as the Clown
says, in the most nicest and the most cleanest and the most charm-
ingest place in all the River Terns, ¿lied as it is almost to the werry
brim, with the most butifidlest and most fairey-like ladies as ewer
pulled a pare of akulls, "without making no Fowls or catching no
Krabs," as the Poet says, and drest in such xquisset taste as most
amost drive the yung fellers mad as rows with 'em.
Great Marlow seems to have made up its mind to be a Greater
Marlow than ever, and is a throwing out its wings to the Heast and
to the West most wrecklessly, and is acshally a bilding of a new
Boat-Ouse dreckly opperset KING SHAW'S, and, as if to hadd hinsult
to hinjury, its bilders has bin and gone and asked the QUEEN to let
'em put up her Majesty's harms, all in gold and warious cullers, jest
over the princepal entrance, and to appint them her Majisty's own
Boatmen " By speshal apintmeant," so that wenever she cums to
Great Marlow and wants a boat for a nour or 2, she will be com-
pelled to go there for it Lasted of to KDÍG SHAW'S, as of course she
wood hotherwise ha' done.
Weather Lord RONGDOLF CHUECHELL—who, I am told, is a going
for to be Prime Minister in the Ouse of Commons—has brort any of
his poUytickle influence to bare in this most himportant matter, I
nose not, but there is warious rumours a stirring in the hair of Great
Marlow, as gives sum of its principle inhabbytants rayther a ankshus
look. If a royal Boatman, why not a royal Baker, or ewen a royal
Shoe-maker? and Echo asks, Why not? We 've got the same
butiful garden liberally throwed open to hewerybody as before, and
relidgusly closed to hewerybody on Sundays as before. The Irish
servant told me it was becos there would be such a lot of peeple
wanting to enjoy it on that day of rest. Àh, it isn't quite a day of
rest for ewerybody tho'. At the Hangler's butiful Otel on the banks
of the River, where numbers of the most helegantcst ladies and gents
sets under the trees a having their dinners, and setterer, there 's ony
two pore perspiring Waiters to wate on 'em all, and ewen they ain't
not allowed not to wear no hats!
We 're in the same cumferal home as last year, but not the same
rooms. More grander praps, but jest a leetel more dusty. Oh, why
doesn't Great Marlow water its one great street, and make it the
airthly Pairadise it would then be? And there 's one thing as I
misses sadly. I'ye lost my pianny-10! and my little boy misses it
too. He was a gitting on so well with his musick last year. He
coud play " Ood Save the Queen," second part and all, with one
finger capitally, amost as loud as sum peeple with all their ten! and
was natrally looking forrard to even himprove upon that this year,
but his hopes is blyted, as usual! So he has, I regreta to say, taken
to Brandy Balls and Toffy!
We has three heasy chairs and sir onheasy ones, and a Sophy, so,
wen it rains, we has plenty of means of making ourselves cumferal
by all going to sleep cumferal together till it's fine again.
Great Marlow has its Great Misterry, as I bleeves most placea has,
but Great Marlow, with a courage and a degree of hopenness as does
it honner, does not attempt to hide or conceal its whereabouts, but
writes boldly on the house as contains it, M. H., which in course
means Mietery House, but it adds as a sort of conumdrum for its
numeras wisiters, " No. 5." Many on 'em has dewoted purs to the ta.sk
why No. 5? but in wain, it still remanes the puzzel it has ever bin.
I have gazed sometimes for 5 minits at a time, on the ouse, with all
its lower winders bricked up and all its hupper winders painted
black, but have never seen nobody enter either of its too sollem
black doors. Time may reweal its prful secret to the lite of day
during the next 10 days, but if not, it will remane to me one of the
great mistende of my waiting xistence. And offen, I makes no dowt,
wen pawsing in my ofishal dooties while the Geste eat their favrite
coarse, the strange thort will cum across me, "Why No. 5?" I must
be on my gard too, or it mite so appen, that wen told to bring a bottel
of No. 5, Imite astonish the Gentelman by asking him in a fit of
habsence, "Why No. 5?"
t If I was a Artist, witch I ayn't at present, and I spose as its a
h MI 1 too late to begin, I shood cum to Marlow ewery fine Sunday
during the Season, and paint all the Ladies in the Lock, and as it
woodn't be quite perfect without their gentlemanly companions, I
should paint em altogether. And I wenture to say,—and arfter my
wisit to the Royal Accaddemy the other day, I think I ort to know
sumthink about Hart,—that a good large Pictur of a full Lock, say
with 2 Steam Larnches and about a dozen row Boats in it, all on 'em
filled with sich bootiful Ladies and sitch fine good looking elthy
young chaps, as I seed them last Sunday, and all drest in sitoh
lovely and fairy like costooms as I never seed afore, wood make sitoh
a pictnr both as regards culler and buty as never was seed since
Lady s first learnt to drees, and Painters lust learned to paint 'em.
If anybody dowts me, let 'em cum nei. Sunday and judge for their-

HALF-A-DOZEN OF THE OTHEE.
MB, PUNCH,—SIB,
Т и к correspondence started in the pages of one of your
contemporaries as to the requirements for a Continental tour by a
gentleman who wrote to ask advice as to what six best books in
various departments of literature he ought to take with him, has
suggested to me how very many of us bent on the same pleasant
experience either modify its pleasure, or spoil it altogether, through
want not of books but of other necessary and familiar things that
we can ill afford to leave at home behind us. How many of us
scarcely care to move if unaccompanied, for instance, by some
favourite musical instrument or objet de vertu, or article of household
furniture indispensable to our comfort. Then, again, how frequently
we dislike giving up some accustomed game or separating ourselves
from some domestic pet; and last, though not least of all, how
nearly all of us leave our medical men behind us with extreme
regret. Yet, if we can drag a cumbersome library about with us,
why should we not, by slightly increasing the bulk of our requisites,
adequately supply these other more pressing and obvious wants and
deficiencies of modern travel? Following, therefore, the lead of
your contemporary to which I have referred, I have asked some of
your readers to send in specimens of what they consider to be the
most fitting way of filling up a list of the above six requisites for
travelling, comprising, as I have already indicated—
1. A favourite musical instrument.
2. A familiar objet de vertu.
3. An indispensable piece of household furniture.
4. A selected game.
5. An ordinary domestic pet.
6. A well-known and rebable medical man.
In reply to this appeal, three Correspondents have already favoured
me with the following answers, which serve to show what a wide
field for the display of variety in taste in the matter the raising of
the question opens out. As they may be useful as a guide to those
who contemplate making an essay for themselves in this direction, I
subjoin them :—

An American Organ

Six selected full-
length Family Por-
traits.
A Drawing - room

A couple of tame

sional umpires.
A pack of Basset

Dr. KIDD.
It will be seen from the above that the writers, though appearing
likely at first sight to be hampered a little in moving from place to
place, through the course of a Continental tour, with the articles they
propose to take with them, evidently regard the transport as quite
feasible. There can at any rate be no doubt as to the success of the
enterprise if carried out. Of course the selection of the six particular
headings is quite arbitrary, and it is quite possible that some
correspondents may be found who would like to take, not one, but
six musical instruments, or, for the matter of that, six medical men
with them, and if there be any such, I invite their communications.
Promising you in the meantime, if I receive any, to furnish you with
them.
I beg to subscribe myself as one who does not consider that to
travel about, even accompanied by an entire circulating library,
comprises the whole art on a holiday tour of,

A "FINE" LOOK-OUT FOR AET.
(Being an Epistle from the Elysian Fields )
"On the 10th March, 1673, there is a minute in the Paynter Stayner
Company's books 'That the painter of Joseph and Pottifer's Wife and the
Fowre Elements be fined £3 6». 8d. for such bad work.' "—Letter from " A
Paynter Stayner,'' in the Standard of August \\th.
ADMIRABLE MB. PUNCH,
"SWEET are the uses of Adversity." The fine of £3 61. Kd.,
inflicted upon me for the bad work—and I am constrained to admit
that it was very bad, though not so bad, of course, as much that is
now exhibited upon your Academy walls—was, in a manner, the
making of me. 1 gave up Art and took to Hosiery, at which honour-
able craft I prospered exceedingly. Bat little did I expect that the
record of my disgrace would be revived more than two centuries
later, to point a much-needed moral and illustrate a thrice-told, but
still terrible, tale. It is a good fortune that that the painter of
"Joseph and Pottifer's Wife," had never anticipated.
Good fortune, I say advisedly. For what pleasanter to the old
"Paynter Stayner," in the peaceful and unprejudiced retirement of
the Shades, than to know that his own evil work lives after in
him, not indeed in scamped substantiality on be-smudged canvas—
that were too dreadful even for a philosophical shade to contemplate
—but in the form of " an awful example," set forth in un wounding
words only, that may be the means of initiating the " crusade against
bad work," of which my far-off fellow Guildsman epeaketh, and of
working real reform and amendment in that Art in which I still
retain a sympathetic interest.
Owing to special privileges of ours which I am not at liberty to
enlarge on, and certain psychical facilities incidental to our state,
which in these days of belief in Lévitation and Astral Bodies I need
not surely explain, I know all about your Art and your Artists.
That knowledge is indeed a dreadful burden, but it has to be borne.
As often as flesh and blood—or rather as spirit and sentience—will
bear it, I visit your Art Exhibitions, particularly the one held at
Burlington House. I need hardly say that I do not, from circum-
stances entirely beyond my control, contribute to the Danäe shower
of shillings whose slackening is now being bewailed in high quarters.
But if the lately exhumed record of my own disgrace ihould work
the effects I am led to hope for, surely I shall be admitted to have
"paid my footing." Besides, Sir, there are my sufferings, as a
periodical spectator, to be considered. They are indeed great. It
was not I who, a season or so ago, wrought certain mysterious muti-
lations within the Academy walls. But myself and my phantasmal
fellow-visitors might surely have been excused if we had adopted
some such means of relieving our outraged feelings. Pictures, Sir,
are annually honoured with places "on the line," compared with
which my soullessly spectacular "Pottifer's Wife," and even my
confusedly allegorical Fowre Seasons," were conscientious master-
pieces. When I think of the monetary mulcts which would have
been imposed upon the perpetrators of each imbecilities and of such
horrors in my days, I have visions of a veritable Ophir of fines—a
perfect Pactolus of pecuniary penalties.
The extent to which " bad work" brings good pay in your days is
positively appalling, Sir. Your official Art system, indeed, seems
especially designed to discourage modest merit, and put a premium
upon pushing mediocrity. Take away from your annual Art-shows
the production of indolent incompetence on the one hand, and
coxcombical charlatanry on the other, and what remains P A respect-
able residuum, doubtless, of true talent, a small remnant of genuine
inspiration. But it is swamped, almost lost, in an ocean of—well, of
"Pottifer's Wives," and " Fowre Seasons," nay, of "bad work,"
more pretentious than the former, and more preposterous than the
latter. But whilst the bad work gets pay, in Phitistia, and place, on
the line, and praise in the papers, where is the chance of a change
for the better '(
Sir, you must "fine " it down (even a spectre can pun, you see),
this torrent of trash. If every popular and clique-petted producer
of pot-boilers is penalised in direct proportion to the intrinsic
badness of his work—as I was two hundred years agone—even fac-
titious, fad-ruled market prices will soon cease to pay him, artful

WE start. Cousin JANE'S husband sees us ofijby train, and then
leaves her to me and the Doctor who has charge of her health at
Royat.
Never in the long water-course of my unhealthy experience have
I ever visited a. station thermale under such favourable circumstances
as the pre-
sent. For
to be in
company
with an
English
Doctor who
has several
patients
under his
care, and
who is on
the spot to
appeal to at
any hour of
the day, and in your own language too,
whatever sudden change may happen to
you, is not this to be under the eye¡ аз it were, of a Special Provi-
dence? And then Dr. PUTTENEY is a personal friend; he will not
look upon me as a strange Doctor would, as a mere body, which means
a no-body, but as a somebody. At the present moment I am bound
to say that I feel, and look, uncommonly well.
JANE is rather poitrinaire-iah and what she calls "rheumatic,"
but I'm sure that Лег symptoms are simply gouty. However she'll
soon know the truth at Royat. She won't believe me, though I 've
told her over and over again that she has incipient gout.
Certainly, as far as I am concerned, there are symptoms—but
surely these may be rheumatism or overworkism, but quite impos-
sible that a shooting pain down my foot, and a red-hot twinge in
my right toe, can be gout! Absurd!
l admit that, in any other person, such symptoms would be deci-
dedly and unequivocally demonstrative of gout. But in myself—oh
dear no—perish the thought! Still I should like to know exactly
what it is; only let my doctors thoroughly understand this before-
hand, that whatever it may be. it isn't gout.
Dr. PUTTENEY has said, "We will find out what it is when we get
you to Royat." So to Royat I go on a sort of voyage of discovery.
"We fly by night." Lovely weather. Bad crossing for many
people, including JANE, for the sea is decidedly rough, though the
Heavens above are clear, and the moon and stars shining brightly. I
am well; yet I feel that any injudicious movement on my part, or
two extra careless lurches finishing with a going-any-how sort
of roll on the part of ithe steamer, would destroy the balance of com-
fort and number me among the victims of sea-sickness. The sensa-
tion caused by this dubious sort of all-rightness, the reason of which
I can't understand,'is so peculiar that there are minutes when I almost
envy the sufferers.
We arrive at Calais: JANE a mere wreck, myself still in an
abnormal state of all-rightness. Not being famished at the moment,
we purchase a little refreshment to take with us. I find time
hanging rather heavily on my hands; the train is pretty full, but we
have secured our seats. Our companions are three grubby-looking
Englishmen, who would not be useful as advertisements for any soap.
I wonder (to JANE) why we do not start. JANE wonders too: but
being sleepy, she is indifferent to all that is going on, and to all that
is not going on, including our train. A bell rings: " En voiture —
pour Paris-^en voiture!" JANE from her dim and distant corner
faintly inquires, "I suppose our luggage is all right?" That is her
fixed idea: that in travelling abroad, your luggage must go wronjr.
I reply of course it 's all right, and am explaining that " when once it
is registered through, you need not trouble yourself about it till yon
reach your destination "—when it suddenly flashes across me that I
had been strictly charged, on starting, to remember that all luggage
for Royal would be examined at Calais, and not at Paris, Heavens!
there are two minutes! As if struck by an electric shock, I jump up,
safely accomplish the difficult feat of letting myself down from the
carriage—which is as if I were escaping from an attic-window—
(why are all these French compartments such a height from the
ground?) rush across the line, on to the platform, and excitedly
demand the douane. In a tone of utter indifference two officials
pause in their conversation to ask me what I said, to which, when
repeated with an adjuration for pity's sake to stop the train,
they reply by pointing out the office "au beut,—là bas "—and I
run to the extremity of the station, burst in among the douaniers,
claim our baggages, (there are no others) swear by everything
I hold sacred that there is nothing contraband in anyone of my
pieces, pointing out that if they stop to examine any of them I shall
lose my train,—the train that is going to Royat,—that it is not a
matter of smuggling, but that it is ma santé qui est enjeu, that on
them will bo the responsibility if ... when me chef (bless him!)
accepting my assurances ¡ goodnaturedly passes them, tells off a couple
of porters to place them ш the train, and grateful beyond expression,
except in bows which are rapid but profuse,—for never did man
make so many obeisances or do such wonderful things with a hat in
one second, as I do on this occasion,—I return the way I came, and
forgetting to remunerate the porters, rush back to our carriage—there
is no difficulty in finding it as JANE'S head and shoulders are leaning
out of the door, and her looks are as distracted as Sister Anne's must
have been when she didn't see anyone coming—scale the dizzy height,
not without injury to my trousers, and once more take my seat,
telling her that it is all right.
Scarcely are the words out of my mouth, when up come two guards
and address me brusquely, as if obeying such a word of command as
"Up, Guards, and at 'em!" "What do they say?" asks JANE.
That we are not in the right carriage for Royat.' No, I know we
are not; but we intend, I inform them with the air of a traveller who
knows his way about, and has done this sort of thing before, to drive
across Paris, and not go by the Ceinture ; and so, Misters, you see we
are in the right carriage for that anyhow. "Guards," baffled, retire.
Then suddenly JANE produces a paper-bag full of greengages. She
has bought them at the station, because it was better than getting
anything to drink. Well, it 's not a bad idea.
Fruit is always wholesome. I try one. Only one is possible: all
the others are as hard аз their own stones, and have to be thrown away
scarcely indented. Indented !—Ah that greengage . . . I bit it. I
partially ate it .... it was sweetish .... it was sourish ....
it was bitter .... and "this indenture witnesseth"
But never again, a greengage ripe or unripe, when travelling. The
next thing, (which I do not attribute to the greengage) is that I
sneeze three times, and find that I have caught cold. Already I am
qualifying for Royat.
Whenever I go abroad again (I made this Mem. 'mentally some
time ago) I will on arrival buy an Indicateur des Chemins de Fer,
which is the French Bradshaw, and most useful not only for the
time one is away, but also, as they do not alter the hours of their
trains very much, whenever one wants to sit down comfortably at
home and map ont a trip from place to place in France.
At Calais there is no bookstall open. Cannot procure the
Indicateur. Perhaps at Boulogne. Boulogne no stoppa."4 to speak
of. All very dark. No sign of bookstall. Consequently 110 indica-
teur. Can procure one somewhere along the line. Bookstall at
Amiens; no Indicateur. Nevermind; sure to get one at the Nord
or at the Paris-Lyon Station.
Journey as usual. Alternately sleepy and wakeful. The Three
Dirty Men fast asleep, breathing heavily, but not snoring. Two of
them become quite disjointed, and tumble up against each other like
badly-packed bags. I envy their deep sleep. Whenever I wake up
and look at them they seem each time to have become hotter and
dirtier, but faster asleep than ever.
At Paris, my trusty friend, GEORGE LAYZO, has sent the in-
valuable Commissionnaire DAVID, in full uniform, at 5'50 A.M., to
take charge'of us, see us across Paris, secure rooms where we can get
"a wash and brush-up," then breakfast, when DAVID produces to-
day's Matin, and gives me all the latest, or earliest, news of Paris.
With nearly another hour to spare, we saunter about, buying books
and papers, while DAVID secures for us a coupe à reculons, in which
we place our small impedimenta, and then we see the carriages, which
have taken all this time gettinground Paris by the Ceinture line from
the Nord station to that of the Paris-Lyon, where we are now, coming
in slowly, and being joined on to our part of the train.
Just as we are leaving I remember that I haven't bought an Indi-
cateur. We are actually moving. Through the noise of bells and steam-
whistles I call out to DAVID, Indicateur—il me faut un Indicateur
Vite! vite.' " DAVID nods amiably towards me, smiles, takes off his cap,
salutes me, and evidently hasn't an idea of what I have been shrieking
out to him. Never mind. Somewhere along the line I can get one.
Certainly at Nevers. Nevers for _Ever! Not a bit. Owing to a
break-down on the part of the engine—very volatile conduct of an
engine doing " a break-down," but perhaps it is its way of letting
off a little of the superfluous steam—our stoppages at the stations
are so uncertain, that it is very risky to leave our carriage at all.
In some places, where an official tells us we are to stop two minutes,
we remain very nearly ten, though it is impossible to foresee this,
and as far as appearances go,—Guards in their places, doors shut,
man ready with flag, telegraph bell ceased—we are ready to start at
any moment (and here is the danger to the unfortunate voyageur],
and at the shortest possible notice. At other stations, where they
profess to stay ten minutes, they give us scarcely two, and I am
actually on my way to a bookstall to purchase an Indicateur, when

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I hear, "En voiture, s'il vota plaît!" and I hurry back againjust in
time to climb up into the. carriage, grazing my knees in the effort,
and to throw myself at the feet of Cousin JANE, who is almost in
a state of collapse at the idea of my being left behind with the
tickets, and the luggage ticket too, in my pocket.
So I give up my search for an Indicateur until I shall arrive at
Clermont-Ferrand.
Cousin JANE'S anxiety is still about the luggage. She does not
believe that it can get on by itself, bat is of opinion that it ought
to be somewhere within reach of the eye, at least. This disturbs
her equanimity,— what disturbs mine is that early greengage. As
the time goes on, and as we go on along that apparently intermin-
able journey, I am becoming more and more the invalid at every
station, until we arrive at Clermont-Ferrand, when I am prostrate.
What I feel fit for is to be carried to a dark room, to be laid on a
sofa, to be covered up, and to moan and groan till I 'm better. At
all events, to suffer alone, and keep my misery to myself.
As it happens ;l am compelled to keep my misery to myself, for
here, on the platform, is Dr. PUTTEITET. looking the picture of health,
and more jovially cherubic than ever, lifting his white hat on a stick
with one hand, and waving a white and yellow handkerchief furiously
with the other, as if he were a bookmaker on a race-course anxious
to indicate the precise spot where he is to be found. It really ex-
presses his delignt at our safe arrival. Near him is Mrs. DINDERLIN,
telegraphing to us with her sun-shade, while a etoutish, elderly
gentleman, of decidedly foreign appearance, in
straw hat, coloured shirt, big white tie, knee-
breeches, and riding-boots, and carrying under
one arm a very small toy Skye-terrier, is moving
towards me (I say " me," for I have lost sight
of Cousin JANE in the crowd), gesticulating with
a whip, his face (which I seem to recognise, but
without being able to associate it with a name
or a place), beaming with smiles as he cries, —
"Alio I Alio! Here they are! Kom tis way
— I show you. Here— ter Arnspektur, he will
take your teekets," — and before I have time to
ask anything, or to explain quietly how unwell
I feel, to Dr. PÜTTENET, who will insist on still
continuing a kind of savage war-dance while
waving his hat and stick — much to the astonish-
ment of the natives, who set him down as an
eccentric Englishman, but of course haven't a
notion that he is a medical man — fortunately
his practice is in London and not here, or such
conduct would ruin his chances — I say before I
have time or opportunity to say a word to
Dr. PUTTENET privately, the excited foreign
gentleman in sporting costume has snatched the
tickets out of my kind, handed them to the
collector, and is lugging me through the crowd,
saying, "Eet is all-right. Tis man here, the
Commissionnaire, will see to all your baggage."
It is booked for Royat, I say, and this station is Clermont-Ferrand.
"C'a ne fait rien, — même chose. You go by road— drive more quick
as the train, and we will be at ter Otel before the baggage. Allons!
We have come at such a pace, by the force of my foreign friend's
energy, through the station and out into the rood, that I have been
unable to look round. Now I see before me a landau with two horses,
and a driver in a blouse (this reminds me of La Bourboule), and in
the carriage is seated Cousin JANE (how on earth did she get there P),
Mrs. DrNDEBMN (who, a minute ago, was on the platform), and
another lady, petite, handsome, dork, with very bright eyes and a
lovely complexion, while Dr. HAMMOND PUTTENEY, white hat in
hand, and still in the highest possible spirits, is holding the door
open for me to step up, and addressing me with great glee as
Altesse." He says, "Montez, Alteste!" in the hearing of the
crowd of porters and omnibus-conductors, travellers, idlers, and
railway officials. The Commissionnaire of the Hotel grins from ear
to ear. He knows that it isn't an Altesse; and even the idlers in
the crowd are too busy to trouble their heads about anyone's affaire
but their own. So Dr. PÜTTENEY'S joke falls a little flat except as
regards himself, with whom it is a great success and "goes"
enormously.
The bright-eyed lady is Madame LEVERRIEZ, to whom I am at
once introduced by Mrs..DiNDEKLiN, and I am preparing a few casual
observations in my best French, when, addressing Cousin JANE and
myself, our new acquaintance says, in excellent English, " You must
be very tired after your journey, but really you both look quite fresh."
It is disappointing, when you expect French, to be addressed in
English. For a moment my command over my own native tongue
seems to have left me, so completely had I made up my mind to
reply in a foreign tongue.
Colonel LEVERHIEZ puts the very small dog which he has been
carrying on his wife's lap, and says, " My dear, take Lili back wit
you. Sue will be lost ш ter crowd, and tere are so many leetel

The Colonel
dogs and poppies about. Ter Docteur and myself, we will go witter
baggage; it is registered for Royat, and we will be at ter Otel as
soon as you. Allons! Docteur!"
The Cherubic Doctor has been standing by, gaily beaming on
everything and everybody through his gold-rimmed spectacles,
with the air of a man who has done his duty with the happiest
possible results. He is awoke from his ecstatic day-dream by a
smack on the back from Colonel LEVEHBIEZ, who, in spite of his
ilightly grey moustache, has more the air of a big boy out for a
lofiday than of a dignified warrior. However, as everything seems
for the best in this best of all possible watering-places, the Cherubic
Doctor only utters a gentle remonstrance, expressed in the words,
"Oh come, I say," when the Colonel, taking him quite affection-
ately by the elbow, and bending his head over him as if he were
imparting to him some amusing information of a strictly private and
personal character, walks him off, and they disappear in the crowd
which is still swarming about the station.
Through Clermont-Ferrand. Even at a first visit, and coming
from the train as we are, tired and dirty, and more inclined to shut
our eyes than open them, it strikes me as a very remarkable old
x>wn. As we leave it, I see the beautiful towers of the Cathedral,
which, like the Crystal Palace, are visible from everywhere ; and they
lave certain advantages over their lofty rival the Puy-de-Dôme, which
is some ten miles or so higher up in the air, perpendicularly, inas-
nuch as they can be seen in pretty nearly all weathers, while the
Puy is frequently in difficulties, that is, "under a cloud ;" they can
also be mounted by the curious traveller in search of a view for con-
siderably less than it costs to ascend the competing mountain; and the
city, being situated in a plain, the Cathedral towers are, so to speak,
within everybody's reach. I look forward to revisiting Clermont-
Ferrand, where there are, the ladies inform Cousin JANE, excellent
shops, and a really very good dress-maker (only away twenty-one
days for a .water-cure, and they can't do without a dress-maker !)
ind I see at once that Royat, which is to Clermont-Ferrrand what
Kensington.is to London, is far superior in the resources of civilisa-
tion to my old friend La Bourboule.
When we are well on our way to Royat I suddenly give a start—
I can't help it—and Mrs. DDTDERLIN anxiously asks me if there 's
anything the matter.
"I 've quite forgot——" I say.
"The luggage V' cries JANE. "I knew it! I felt certain"
"No, no," I hasten to reassure her. "The luggage is all right.
You '11 see it at Royat. But—I 've quite forgotten the Indicateur!"
"Oh, well," says JANE, who always likes to offer consolation, "you
can easily get one here, or on our road back."
Yes ; I will. I must get one here, in case we want to return by some
other route. But it is curious that during so many hundred miles
from London to Clermont-Ferrand, I have not been able to purchase
an Indicateur des Chemins de Fer. So strongly am I bent on pro-
curing an Indicateur, that for the moment all other considerations of
health seem to have been put aside, and my one object in coming to
Royat appears to have been (unconsciously to myself up till now) the
purchase of a French Railway Guide, price seventy-five centimes.
Up-hill all the way, under a viaduct, past some gardens and a
stand of voitures on our left, past hotels, ships, and booths, post-
office, more hotels, round a corner, up-hill again, and into a sort of
tea-garden, where there are tables and seats under the trees, which
is the court-yard of our hotel, the Hotel Continental. This court-
yard adjoins a terrace, which I ascertain by walking to the balus-
trade at the edge and looking over, is actually the leads of the Premier
and Splendid Hotels, commanding one of the finest views in Royat
of the park below and of the distant country. In point of fact wo
have driven upstairs, and alighted on the roof of the notel where we
are going to stop. This is astonishing, but true. A sharp-eyed,
pleasant-faced young man steps forward. This, says Madame
LEVERHIEZ, is Monsieur BAEHX the Manager. Once more I am pre-
paring my best, or second-best, French for Monsieur ВАЕНЪ, and
once more I am disappointed.
"Your rooms are ready. Madam," he says politely to Cousin JANE,
in English which scarcely betravs the accent of any nationality.
"Yon would like to see them? This way, I will show you." And
so he bows us pleasantly off the roof, and we find that we have only
one short flight of stairs to descend in order to reach our rooms on the
top floor of the hotel below. And so here we are at Royat!
Charming rooms!
"And the luggage?" exclaims JANE, looking blankly at me.
"It must have arrived," says M. BAEHT., reassuringly, and so he
conduct« us back again to the court-yard on the roof.
WHAT will not be the new Barrel of Burton's motto, "All hops
abandon ye" P Perhaps "One good Tun deserves another," and
"All Ale!" (Macbeth) will receive favourable consideration. It is
reported that the new Peer is about to produce a work on the
composition of Pale Ale, which will be entitled "Sur ton's
Anatomy,"

GODWIN'S GUILE;
A STORY OF THE FOOL'S REVESGE.
DEAR MR. NIBBS,
As you have asked me to report upon the recent doings at the
Opéra Comique, I obey your commands. You must know, then, that
some little while ago this theatre was opened, with rather a flourish of
trumpets, under the management of Mr. E. W. GODWIN, the great
authority upon Art and Costume. The campaign did not commence
with a new piece, but reliance was placed upon The Fool's Revenge,
a clever adaptation of Le Roi ¿Amuse, by the late Ton TAYLOR, in
which—во rumour said—a well-known "professional Beauty" and
her sister had made their first appearance. The opening night was,
I am given to understand, a perfect triumph. Every place in the
house, 1 believe, was taken, and I am under the impression that even
Royalty was present. From the fact that the bill had to be
strengthened shortly afterwards, I feared that perhaps the " good
business" of the initial performance might have been transitory.
My apprehensions were soon verified, as, upon visiting the theatre
about a week or ten days ago, I found the numbers of those then
present insufficient (to put it mildly) to warrant a display of a
placard hearing the legend of "House quite full—standing room
only." It is unnecessary to say that no such misleading announce-
ment was made either in the lobby, which looked dull, or the entrance-
hall, which had the appearance of not being much frequented.
However, the two Plays (the Tragedy already mentioned was supple-
mented with Dr. Davy) were interesting, and fairly acted. The
mounting of The Fool's Revenge was magnificent—dresses admir-
able, and scenery splendid. The " interiors " of the Ducal Palace,
and the house of the "Old Condottiere''' in this clever piece, quite
realised Italian life at the end of, I think, the fifteenth century. The
two "professional Beauties" were very beautiful, and both of them
kne w tneirparts. It would perhaps be difficult to find a better " Fool ''
than Mr. HERMANN VEZIN, and Mr. HERBERT played another varia-
tion of the character with nearly equal success. The piece ended
with rather a feeble tag from one of the " Beauties," to the effect that
she (the Beauty) was ready to answer for some deed or other (I think
it was poisoning her husband, or something equally excusable)
when caned upon so to do. I have a foolish fancy that this was
not the last line in Mr. TAYLOR'S adaptation, hut I may be wrong.
Of Dr. Davy I can say little, as the attendant who furnished me
with a playbill rightly informed me that it did not contain a cast of
that piece. However, Mr. VEZIN I distinctly recognised in the hero,
and to the best of my belief spotted one of the "Beauties" in the
part originally filled by poor NELLIE MOORE at the Haymarket. Mr.
VEZIN of course was Mr. VEZW, and the Beauty was better than she
had been in the Fool's Revenge. Altogether, the Orchestra and
myself, and the rest of the audience had a very pleasant evening.
A few nights ago I repeated my visit, on the occasion of the pro-
duction of a comedy called Bachelor!. As Mr. BUCHANAN was
associated in the authorship, I was sure that the play would be
"true to life," and felt comfortable about the appropriateness of
the scenery, thanks to the fact that the theatre was under the
management of Mr. E. "W. GODWIN. The curtain rose upon one of
the most magnificent rooms I had ever seen, although it appeared
strangely familiar to me, which, however, had a decidedly foreign
appearance. I soon discovered that it was not intended to be foreign,
being merely an apartment in Bachelors' Hall. This thoroughly
English dwelling-place was tenanted by three Bachelors—a Q.C., a
Doctor of Medicine (who, I fancy, must have been intended to be
hiding away from the police, as he was not very well disguised in a
very false moustache), a Professor of Music, and also by a House-
keeper, her daughter, and a would-be comió Butler.
I soon ascertained that the Housekeeper was anxious to marry her
daughter to the Professor of Music, as the richest of her three
employers, from which I fancy the practice of the Q.C. (who, appa-
rently, was a leader in the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Divi-
sion) and the Doctor (whose patients, seemingly, received his
professional visits at eight in the morning) could not have been very
considerable. Later on, I found that the Q.C. had a nephew who
somehow or other had to marry a widow, to fulfil a legal necessity to
secure a fortune; and who, consequently, did not wish to contract
the marriage. With the traditional shrewdness of one called within
the Bar, the Q.C. strongly recommended his relative to refuse to
contract the match, his sole reason for giving this sage advice being
that bachelorhood was better than marriage. Then the wealthy
Professor of Music (who had, I believe, amassed his large fortune by
giving lessons on the piano in a provincial town) somehow or other
became engaged to the widow, a f riend of hers, and the Housekeeper's
daughter all at once. Then everything was explained, and the Q.C.
(shrewd to the last) married the landlady.
This charming story of simple English life was illustrated (as I
have already hinted), with the most magnificent scenery. I have
said that the view of a dining-room in Bachelors' Hall, was magnifi-
cent, but words fail to express the splendours of the boudoir of the
widow—gorgeous colouring, beautiful decorations, even the sky seen
without was of pure Italian blue—Italian blue! "Italian blue.! As I
write a light grows in upon me. Where had I seen that beautiful
apartment in Bachelors' Hall before? Where had I gazed upon the
familiar magnificence of the widow's boudoir in more melancholy
days P Answer to both questions—in the Foots Revenge! As the
Hall in the Ducal Palace r As the room in the " Old Condottiere's"
house? I am afraid it was indeed the case! I can write no more!
I did think; yes, I did think, that with a theatre under the manage-
ment of Mr. E. W. GODWIN that we should be certain of appropriate
scenery. To mount a quiet domestic Comedy of simple (very simple)
English life like Bachelors with "interiors" belonging to Italy at
the end of the fifteenth century was too much for
CHARLES—YOUR FRIEND.
A PIOTTS HISTRION.—To judge from the report of the finish of
Mr. WILSON BARRETT'S speech at his farewell theatrical banquet,—
when he invoked such a blessing on the company there assembled as
might benefit them during his temporary absence in America,—
should an under-study be at any time wanted to occupy the Rev.
STEWART HEADLAM'S pulpit, the Bishop of LONDON need only Bend
to the Princess's Theatre. If Mr. BARRETT were a trifle stouter, he
might make up for an Anglican dignitary, though there is something
in his face perhaps a little too Roman. We hope his American trip
will be successful, although (absit omen.') the voice of the WARNER
was heard from the chair on the occasion of this gushing farewell.

NEW EULES FOE MEDICAL STUDENTS.
DEAB РРЯСН,—The following is a specimen of the admirable regulations prescribed for the
Medical Students of Excelsior College :—
Every Student is expected to reside in the Collegiate Establishment, and, unless detained
by evening lecture, to return home at latest by 7'14, and, after perusal of his notes, succeeded
by a light supper, if necessary, of dry toast and tea, or gruel, or arrow-root, with, if preferred,
a small tumbler of lemon-squash, to retire to bed, tucked up for the night's repose, at 8'30.
To rise not later than six, winter and summer, and take an hour's exercise in one of the
tennis-courts before breakfast, which should consist of a limited mess of porridge, and a cup
of tea, coffee, or chocolate, not too strong. At the most convenient interval of attendance at
lectures, clinical studies, and dissections, to adjourn from the Hospital to the adjacent refec-
tory, for dinner, consisting usually of a small mutton-chop, bread, potatoes, and an apple-
dumpling, with toast-and-water, or soda-water simple, ad libitum. On no account what-
ever to take his meals at a tavern.
Daily, at an hour appointed by the Sub-
Dean, Dr. FOKCEPS, Professor of Anatomy,
to report himself to that officer, and un-
dergo a dissection of his pursuits and recrea-
tions out of school-hours the day before, for
t lie "iu formation and satisfaction of his
parents and friends.
The Medical Faculty of Excelsior Col-
lege, though desirous to retain all the
Students under thorough supervision, by
no means propose to treat them as boys.
On the contrary, they strictly forbid them
to play at marbles, whipping-top, or peg-
top, or to trundle hoops in the College-
quadrangle; and any detected in a game
of pitch-and-toss will be severely repri-
manded. Every Student discovered to have
been present at a Music Hall, will have his
fees returned to him, and be expelled.
As a Student under the old régime, I may
be allowed to contrast the foregoing regu-
lations with an extract from my own diary of
other days :—
"Up at eight with a splitting headache
(oysters and porter overnight), breakfast
on devilled kidneys and strong coffee, topped
up with a nip of 'Old Tom.' At nine to
demonstration in the anatomical theatre—
rummy stories told by the demonstrator,
Mr. GOITT—don't remember much else.
Then to lecture on Chemistry and Materia
Medica; next, went the round of the wards
with Dr. SLOOO. After that, dissection of a
lower extremity, stout and biscuits in the
rooms, and a spar between the son of the
Head-Surgeon and Old NICK, the resurrec-
tion-man. Then up Holbprn, smoking a
cigar. Purchased a portrait of the Tipton
Slasher, and PAULINE, the Pet of the Ballet.
At half-past four to dine at the 'Stilton
Cheese,' rump-steak and onions, stewed
cheese, a pint of ale, and three goes' of
punch. Back to the Hospital, where surgical
lecture, at which I saw the lecturer double.
Off to the play—sucked an orange in the pit.
Performance over at eleven, then to the
'Shades,' where supper, poached eggs, a
pot of half-and-half, go of whiskey and
water hot, and two cigars. A lot of glees
and comic songs, several of a spicy nature.
Herr VON SAMTTEL sang a German song,
'Mädel, doo bist miney Friday,' and
NATHAN, the improvisatore, an extempore,
in which he made a verse on me, and I tried
to punch his head. There was a row, and I
got turned out. Home at three in the
morning through Long Acre, where a snob
asked me how I was off for soap, and I
floored him. To bed at four, and found next
morning I had lost my ' ticker.'"
Candour, Sir, howevert compels me to say
that a reasonable supervision is highly ne-
cessary for Medical Students, young men in
London whose future career would certainly
be rather imperilled by the somewhat lax
habits for which they were certainly a little
too notorious in the early days of your
ancient friend, ROBERT SAW Y кк.

MEMBERS WE SHALL MISS.
SOME more sketches of Members of the last Parliament who have joined the majority.
Don't mean the majority against GLADSTONE, but that larger majority of men who have been
m the House of Commons and are there no more. Here (7) is the
portrait of Mr. D. J. JENKINS, as
he appeared when the truth began
to dawn upon him that the poll
was going against him at Penryn-
and-Falmouth. Observe the
resolute appearance of the coat -
tail, which is still "cocky,"
and refuses to believe in the
gathering rumours of defeat.
But the slight bend in the
knee, the limp fall of the
arm,'and the anxious look
in the right eye, betray
the situation. JENKINS
had a near run last time,
beating young CAVENDISH
BENTINCK by a little over
a hundred. Now CAVEST-
, , DISH BENTINCK beatihim
£ by little under a hundred,
and once more we shall have
two CAVENDISH BENTINCKS, to
the delight of the House of
Commons, though the presence
of a full-grown son is likely
to detract from that charming
juvenile appearance which has
ever distinguished the Member
for Whitehaven.
"Ain't I like Lord SALISBURY?" said Mr. SPJCER (8) presenting himself before the

thing like the appalling spectacle, nightly
familiar, when Colonel HARCOURT, in the ,,m

riW-rte with his brother, a colleague of Mr. GLADSTONE'S. Mr. HIBBERT (10) is out again.
Oldham has played fast and loose with him for nearly thirty years, and now it has again
rejected him. It 's very strange, Mr. HIBBEHT thinks. But ne 's not the man to complain.
He will doubtless stand again on the next opportunity; meanwhile he sits in a comer and

had my father or mother, or both, married some one other than they
did. Should I have been, under certain unknown conditions, Mr.

to solve the insoluble, I have seen Colney Hatch in the dim perspec-
tive, but, thanks to Dr. WITHERS-MOORE'S address to the British
Medical Association at Brighton, I see a ray of hope, for he asks,

(Ttie Address of the following is illegible.)
MY DEAR SIR,
THE sincere sympathy with which I have followed your
brilliant career as a dramatist, prompts me to seek your collaboration
in a new comedy, the idea for which has recently occurred to me.
I have the vanity to believe that my plot is absolutely new and
original, as you will see it affords admirable opportunities for the
exercise of your peculiar ingenuity of treatment, though space
obliges me to give but the barest outline of both donnée and mntif.
My notion is (shortly) this: A., a wealthy rag-and-bottle-merchant
in the City, is secretly engaged to a Roumanian (or Bulgarian) lady
ventriloquist. (You can make plenty of fun out of this ! ) But A.
has a nephew, on the wife's side, who is enamoured of the daughter
of an Arohbishop-^-there has never been an Archbishop in modern
comedy — and who is also largely interested in a project for making
jam out of ship's barnacles. Complications, which you will readily
imagine, but which I have not as yet had leisure to elaborate, arise
from this, and are connected by a ficelle (which I will leave to your
well-known fertility of invention) with the matrimonial adventures
of a maiden lady of over middle age, who imagines herself attractive,
and is desperately anxious to secure a husband. Here again you
have a character new to the Stage, and, with your talent, you should
be able to devise situations for more fully developing the peculiari-
ties I have but sketched.
The consequences of the imbroglio we can best work out in con-
sultation, and I must ask you to make an appointment for this
purpose as soon as possible, as I am occupied tn other pursuits. I
may add that I have suffered so much from dramatists of supposed
reputation, who, nevertheless, have not scrupled to rob me of ideas
I have submitted to them in all confidence, that though I trust to
your honour not to make any unprincipled use of the dramatic mate-
rial I hereby entrust for your consideration only, I shall, in the event
of your proving yourself a pirate like the rest, enforce my rights by
every means in my power. I am yours faithfully,
(Signature undecipherable).
хххтш.
Mr DEAREST Атгат, Craven Street, Strand.
You have frequently expressed a wish to see me happily
united in wedlock to a young lady you could respect and esteem,
and it now becomes my pleasant task to inform you that your desire
is about to be more than realised.
If you have perused some of the lighter theatrical periodicals, you
can hardly fail to have remarked the name of a Miss POPSIE FOL-
JAMBE, and wül also have noted that she is invariably mentioned in
a tone of cordial and unqualified commendation.
Seeking relaxation from the course of strict and arduous study
upon which I have, at your suggestion, entered in order to fit myself
for the noble profession of the Law, I have casually encountered this
"gem of purest ray serene " in the various caves of harmony which
exist in our great Metropolis, and, after long and persevering efforts,
at length succeeded in being admitted to the privilege of her ac-
quaintance.
She is indeed a being whom it is only necessary to know to love!
and is, moreover, universally acknowledged to be the quickest
lightning-change artist in the Profession.
She is not perhaps what you would call highly educated, but she
has a mind of striking range and cultivation, and, without being in
anyway a blue, takes a warm interest in topics of the day. She is
one of Nature's own gentlewomen, and her patter and step-dancing
bear the stamp of true genius. I long to bring her to see you at
dear old Clapham, and shall hope for an early opportunity of intro-
ducing her to your tea-table some Sunday afternoon.
Her birth and parentage are not unworthy of her. Her father has
long occupied the prominent and responsible position of Chairman of
the Accordion Music Hall, and is a gentleman of distinguished
manner, though affable and accessible to all who approach nim in
the right spirit. Her mother is a lady in whose simple dignity it
would be difficult to detect the whilom " Female Jester " whose wit
and wisdom have brightened so many a provincial Circus, and her
brother (now abroad for the benefit of his health) but lately retired
from the turf, where he is greatly missed, with a considerable sum
as the reward of his industry and foresight. Her sister is perhaps
the leading lady-banjoist in Europe, and was lately presented with
the silver belt of Championship, while her uncle's name, SAH
KICKSY, will doubtless be familiar to you in connection with slab
and spade dancing. So that you have no cause to blush for the new
relatives with whom I hope to present you.
But why enlarge on all this when you can see my pearl with your
own eye»? If you Mil have any doubts whether I have decided
upon my present step without due circumspection, and the maturest
deliberation, come, my dear Aunt, and resolve them for yourself!
Mention my name any evening, about Eleven, at the doors of the
Accordion, and you will be passed in at once, and, when my beloved
comes on for her usual turn, you will be enabled to form some faint
idea of the heights to which she is capable of rising.
Awaiting your blessing, by return of post, I am, my dear Aunt,
always your affectionate Nephew, THEOPHILUS BOUNDER.
P.S.—I find the expenses of life as a London student have been
very much under-estimated, and shall be glad of a cheque to accom-
pany blessing as above.
A BROKEN-HEARTED BALLADE.
NAY! but talk not to me of the rush to the North,
Every station and platform at present pervading,—
Of the wild Southron hordes every day pouring forth
And in shoals all our sweet heather moorland invading.
For I 've let all I own to three Manchester men,
And I picture their heads consequentially wagging
As they stalk, perhaps kilted, to seize on my glen,
Where I know that my grouse they '11 be constantly bagging.
Ah, to know that a stranger your property's looting,
It's that hits you hardest in letting your shooting.
Shall I stay? nay, I '11 off to some far southern shore,
And 1 '11 leave far behind me my own Scottish weather,
And beneath bluer heavens I '11 ponder no more
On the mists that are drenching my loved native heather \
And it may be to me p'raps will come home the thought,
From these Manchester men that my keep I 've been earning—
And I '11 solace myself with this comforting thought
Till the last bird being killed sees me once more returning!
But it 's aye for old ties and old feelings uprooting,
There 'a nothing can touch one like letting the shooting!
A BODKIN'S, POINT.—" Under proper control" means properly
muzzled or led by substantial person using chain, cord, leather, or
something sufficiently strong. Mr. Punch confirms the contention of
Mr. BODKIIÍ, who naturally is a very sharp lawyer. Res acu taita

GOING NORTH!
THE following condensed extract from a contemplated edition of
Bradihaia, specially annotated and revised for the purpose, is
recommended to all thinking oi journeying beyond the Tweed :—
LONDON—10 A.M.—This train crammed with tourists, sportsmen,
dogs, babies, servants and general passengers, made up to double its
ordinary length, is at last started thirteen minutes late and leaves
the station at a slow crawl.
GRANTHAM—2 '17 P.M.—Arrives here one hour and fifteen minutes
behind time. Passengers can alight here and ask guard what it all
means, but will pet no information.
YORK—4'59.—Fresh influx of tourists, sportsmen, dogs, guns, and
babies here. Train stops eighty-seven minutes for dinner. Passengers
wiehing to be in time for the Highland train from Perth, can here
threaten the Directors, write to the Times, or go back to London by
the next train and give it up.
NEWCASTLE—9'29.—Train two hours and twenty-seven minutes
behind time. Third-class passengers who wish to protest, can get
out here, and, tearing their hair, bathe their heads in cold tea in the
refreshment-room, in presence of the local porters. Wait of twenty-

EDINBURGH—12'2,—It being past midnight, all passengers alight
here off their heads, and after chasing the Station-Master all over
the building, join in a general Scotch reel on the down platform,
from which they are finally with difficulty hustled back again into
the train by the authorities, aided by the police, and are at last
started en route for Perth, a hundred and seventy minutes behind
time, singing' " Soot» toha hoe " in unison.
PERTH—ЗчЗ A.M.—Reached three hours and thirty-five minutée
after time, the last Highland train having started North two hours
and a quarter previously. Passengers, on hearing this announce-
ment made to them, and being informed they must finish the night
on the platform, alight here in wild hysterics, and proceed to wreck
the Pullman sleeping-car, and make a bonfire with the debris, the
Traffic Manager, who endeavours to interfere, only escaping being
lynched on the spot by climbing up aloft, and hiding in the iron
rafters. The Refreshment-room is also broken into soon after day-
light here, when a wild orgy on cold coffee and uncooked salmon
cutlets ensues, and is continued till tickets being inspected under the
supervision of the local Military, the morning traffic is resumed, and
the tourists, sportsmen, dogs, servants, babies, and general passen-
gers, are gradually despatched northwards, in diminishing, but
irritable and discontented batches, and the ordinary business of the
day is once more proceeded with as usual.

A way of settling old accounts completely;

MORE "CHICKEN AND CHAMP AGNE1"
WE thank thee, Mr. MOWBBAY MOBRIS for having
taught us this phrase. We have received at our office a
card, of which the following is an exact copy :—
Empire Theatre, ША August, 1886.
"MB. D. NICOLS having now undertaken the direction of the
above Theatre, and wishing to be personally acquainted with the
gentlemen of the Press, will he pleased to see them at the Café
Hoyal on Saturday next, the 21st inst., at 6 P.M."
This expresses a most amiable intention on the part of
Mr. D. NICOLS, of which perhaps " the Gentlemen of the
Press," may have by this time shown their full apprecia-
tion. We should be inclined, however, to think that the
Gentlemen of the Press, will have shown their self-respect
by not accepting Mr. D. NICOL'S kind invitation, and that
those irresponsible journalists who may have availed
themselves of the Director of the Empire Theatre's dis-
interested and genial hospitality will not be precisely
the Gentlemen of the Press.
Is Mr. D. NICOLS also the proprietor of the Café Royal?
the name is similar, and if he be, we can thoroughly com-
pliment him on his cuisine and his cellar, and upon the
general management of his restauration. Why can't he
be content with his success there, instead of seeking for a
new Empire, the possession of which has not been an un-
mixed blessing to its former Directors. However, as he
has gone in for a new venture, let it stand on its own
merits; but Mr. NICOLS will, we fancy, find himself mis-
taken, if he thinks that the gush of such " Gentlemen of
the Press," as he has feasted and feted at the Cafe Royal,
will be of the slightest service towards establishing the
success of his new speculation in Leicester Square.
PLUCKY CHEATUBES.—"Is Ostrich-Farming Cruel?"
Rather, perhaps, when the poor birds are plucked. In
that case they would affect the sympathies of Undergra-
duates and other students. Only the Ostriches are not
condemned to undergo a stiff examination.

THE luggage has arrived. The Cherubic Doctor and the Colonel
have been carried up with it by the omnibus, and the whole lot,
consisting of the two men and the
four boxes, have been safely depo-
sited on to the roof of our hotel.
"To what address shall we have our
letters sent?" I ask M. ВАЕНЪ.
"Oh," replies our obliging Manager,
"it is all the same. "We are five
hotels, one on the top of another, the
Premier, the Splendid, the Conti-
nental, the Chabassiere, and the
Annexe. Address which you like,
Sir; the letters are sure to come
safe."
"Pairfaitly," says the Colonel.
"Tere ees er man who cannot read;

One of the gracious Nymphs of the delivered all right. Vonterful!"
Eugenie Fountain. д^ he S?lile3 enoouragmcly on M.
ВАЕНЪ. as if he had been bestowing the highest praise on the method
adopted.
Three of the abovementioned hotels seem to have been built in the
lower part, and the two others are built against the upper part of a
rocky mountain-side, an advantageous site, probably the result of a
prehistoric volcanic eruption—(which could not of itself have thrown
up a whole collection of hotels from the depths of its own inner volcanic
consciousness)— and from the garden-court-yard, where the salle à
manger is situated, and which therefore is the centre of attraction to
all the visitors, are various flights of steps leading down to mysterious-
looking door-ways and passages, so that this garden resembles
the feeding ground of a human rabbit-warren, and we are the bunnies
who at stated times come out of our holes, run up to feed, and,
having finished our meal, we pop back into our holes, not to be seen
all together again till next feeding-time.
"Now," says Doctor HAMMOND PUTTENEY, "we give you twenty
minutes to prepare for dinner. We are already late," and his face
actually assumes an air of severity, which is probably not entirely
unconnected with an interior appreciation of the emptiness of most
human organisations at a certain fixed hour.
None of us require any further hint, the Colonel and Madame
LEVEKRIEZ are already disappearing down into a hole on the left of
the warren, we catch a glimpse of the last of Mrs. DINDEKIJN'S skirt
as she vanishes into another hole opposite, Mr. ВАЕНЪ retires into his
bureau hole, the waiters, who have come out to take stock of the new
arrivals, are scampering back into their salle-à-manger hole. Dr.
HAMMOND РЦТТЕКЕГ runs down an incline, and apparently goes head-
first into his own particular hole. The Concierge, in blue and silver
livery, appears out of a sort of game-keeper's hut on the premises,
(and perhaps it is at the sight of him that all the rabbits have
scuttled away frightened), the Chambermaid and Boots belonging to
our ¿tage appear on the steps leading to our rooms, and following
their lead, we also vanish to our holes under the roof—which sounds
more like starlings, or mice, than rabbits—and I find myself over-
looking a most beautiful view which tempts me away from my
sumptuary preparations for dinner. When I emerge and come out
into the upper air, there is no one on the garden-roof. The Concierge
(who most annoyingly will insist on speaking English, but whom I
persist in answering ш French,—his nationality being Swiss and his
native tongue principally German,) informs me that they have all
gone into dinner; and at an oval table, private, and out of reach of
the noise and rattle of the table-d'hote, from which we are divided
by a temporary screen, I find seated Madame LEVEEHIEZ, Dr. HAM-
MOND PUTTENEY, the Colonel, Mrs. DIITDEHLTN, Cousin JANE and
next to her a lady_ with whom Cousin JANE seems already on terms
of the closest intimacy, and to whom she immediately presents me.
She is a Mrs. TOFFAM, a sparkling-eyed American, speaking with
just enough accent to give her remarks a certain piquancy which
arrests attention. I nave often remarked that a commonplace
observation about the weather, a request to pass the salt, or an inquiry
as to the state of your health, it given with the least American
intonation, will be received by an ordinary English audience with
a broad grin; and an obvious repartee, similarly delivered, will be
the signal for almost inextinguishable mirth.
Dr. HAMMOND PUTTENET at meal-times is more cherubic than
ever, as, metaphorically of course, he " sits up aloft to keep watch
for the life of poor Jack "—poor Jack representing in this case the
patients generally, who, while feeding, are under the lynx-eye of
Dr. PUTTENET.
Never have I seen the proverb that what is one man's meat is
another's poison, so perfectly illustrated, as in this dining-room,
and at our particular table, where Dr. PUTTENET, with hie watchful
eye, not only on us, but on the diners at many other tables, partakes
heartily of everything, as he is out fora holiday, and " treating him-
self"—and I must say he treats himself very handsomely. On the
table, with the costly wine of the country, of which, as at La Bour-
boule, the Hotel is so lavish that as much as each person can drink
of this rare stuff (thank goodness, very rare !) is included in the price
of the dinner, and so we call it " the generous,"—a name by which it
is henceforth known to the waiter who serves our table,—there are all
sorts of the waters of the place, Cesar, St. Mart, and Fonteix, which,
as the Irishman said of the whiskey, "take the cruelty out of the
water,"—only, in this case, it is the water which takes the cruelty
out of the wine.
As everyone at our table is taking baths and waters, we have
plenty to talk about, the main subject at every repast being our
progress, our symptoms, and ourselves generally since we were last
together round the festive board.
None of us ever meet without comparing notes of new pains and
fresh symptoms. When undergoing a treatment, the knowledge that
others are having, or have had, all the pains which have so taken
oneself by surprise on their first appearance, is a great solace and
encouragement to persevere. It is comforting to be assured that
your particular pain in your own particular toe is not the only pain
in the world; that others are suffering equally in corresponding toes,
and that others have suffered it and have got rid of it—" it may be
for years, it may be for ever." And let me add, with all my heart and
toe, another quotation, "If for ever, then for ever fare thee well!"
The night is lovely. We take our coffee and cigars—Dr. PUTTENET
permits coffee, cigars, and liqueurs, and I hope Dr. REM, to whose
care he will resign me to-morrow, will be of the same opinion—out in
the garden of the Casino Sarnie, and once more, after an interval of
two years, I see my old friends, the petits chevaux, with their petits
jockeys, going round and round with the same provoking uncertainty;
and, as if they, too, were glad to welcome me back again, they allow
me to back the winner twice out of three times. Cousin JANE,
becoming rash, ventures two francs, and retires discomfited. She
says she was not made for a gambler, and thinks that as early hours
are to be our rule, the sooner we go to our rooms and "couch our-
selves" the better for health.
Just as we are leaving, Dr. REM enters the grounds, and
Cousin JANE and myself are introduced to him. Slight, above the
middle height, is Dr. REM, with a countenance expressive of the
utmost benevolence, and clear bright eyes which regard you straight
in the face, as much as to say, Yes, I am benevolent and kind,
but don't you attempt to presume on these qualities, or you'll find
yourself considerably out in your calculations, my friend." Dr. REM,
like Sir PEN OLIVEK, Grand Master of the Knights of the Octave
Table, is not only a distinguished physician, but a man of letters, an
enthusiast in every department of science, something of an artist
(as indeed his name indicates), and as devoted to music as is Sir PEN
to etching and painting. He is an Englishman, though his i, •" • is
foreign, and, if there were another syllable to it, he would have been
able to claim descent from one of the greatest of the Old Masters. I

Mr DEAR SIR, Bedford Park.
Yotr ask me if I can tell you, "in a friendly way," and
'shortly," why I am so angry with the Academy. Sir, these things
cannot be stated shortly, nor m a friendly way! It began years ago.
My first picture was rejected; was thrown on my hands. It repre-
sented " Jonah and the Whale." I was obliged by poverty, Sir, to
sell it (with alterations) to the keeper of an angling inn, as a sign.
It is thus that a country like ours treats original genius.
There is worse to come. You have, indeed, hung me, sometimes,
but not always, on the line, and often in the Fifth Gallery. Mean-
while, all the time that the Academy has been keeping me down, out
of mere spite and jealousy, they have elected all the young men I
started in life with! They are popular painters. My "Siege of
Samaria" (painted on the spot, too, as far as it can be ascertained),
and representing real Jews, really awfully hungry, has not been
bought by the nation. What is the Chantrey Fund good for?
And you ask me to be short, and you ask me to be friendly. But
wait till I start a really National Exhibition (with me for President).
Just you wait. Yours, more in sorrow than in anger,
POTTOBOILEKI SHOWN.

I H Mi SlB,
You ask me to be one of the Guarantees of a fund for a
National Exhibition, in which no Academician or Associate shall be
allowed to exhibit, nor anyone who paints from female models.
Excuse me for saying that, whether I regard your scheme as a pecu-
niary investment, or as a mode of encouraging national Art, I cannot
hope to find profit in the project.
With sincere regret, believe me yours,

DEAR JANE, The Dovecot, Bullocksmithy.
I AM quite unhappy about ATALANTA. She has been so silly
about a dreadful young man, a Mr. PRIOSBY, who came here lec-
turing, and lent her books and things, and talked nonsense about
Greece, and Buddhism, and read his own poems. 1 'm sure he means
nothing at all; he is only what I call an educational flirt. He pre-
tends he has a mission to educate women, and it 's just another name
for the most heartless flirtation. May I send her to you at Scar-

I spent in lecturing at Bullocksmitny, and especially how much I
owe to your kind sympathy and assistance. In future I shall often
look back with pleasure to those edifying hours. I hope you will
keep up your studies of Omar Khayyam, if only in memory of me.
We are not likely ever to meet again, as I am on my way to study
Esoteric Lamaism, in Thibet. Whether I become a Mahatma, or
only remain as at present, ahumble "Chela taking notes." as BURNS
says, I shall never forget all the kindness I received at Bullocksmithy.

DEAR GARB, Hotel Meurice, Paris.
You are on the list to lecture next winter at Bullocksmithy,
on "The Renaissance in its Darker'Aspects," as usual, I suppose?
I don't know if you will find them^very appreciative at Bullock-
smithy. I've been there, lecturing on "Buddhism made Easy,"
"The Light of Asia," and all that. They are not very sympathetic,
except a dear gushing little thing; ATALANTA GIHTON is her funny
name. Please don't tell the GIRTONS you know me, but, if they do
find it out, telllthem I am studying Lamaism in Thibet. We shall
meet at St. Gatien's next term, no doubt; I like to run down and see

Mr DEAR RANDOLFO,
Now you are a big swell and Leader in the place of Old
"Collared Head" as we used to call him, do not forget your humble
follower and faithful chum of the good old Fourth Party days.
Remember how I backed you up and prompted you when you were
a little uncertain of your points. Yon '11 want me near you, I know
you will, after a time; there '11 be some chance for me in a bye-
election probably, and tül then you can find me something to do
which will not keep me so far away from my old companions-in-arms—
we were all parliamentary babies-in-arms together, so to speak—as
I am now. 1 don't like the climate: if I stay out here much longer
it may affect my head, and I may do strange things. I should be
sorry to embarrass the Government in any way, so the sooner you
have me back, and by your side, the better for all. Love to GORST
and BALFOUR. You 've not done very much for them, but, after all, it
was as much as they deserve; and no doubt you are keeping back a
real good thing for yours ever most heartily and sincerely,
Cairo, Egypt. Your own old DRUMMY.
THE NEXT WAR—ON PAPER.
"Now," said the English General, as he sat in his tent speaking
to his Chief of the Staff, "have we got everything ready?"
"Yes, Sir," replied his trusty assistant, " all is arranged according
to precedent. You know the enemy have landed?"
Indeed !" exclaimed the General. "Theoretically, they should
have been blown out of the water by the torpedoes of our fleet."
"Theoretically, they have ; but actually they are on their way to
attack us."
"Well, well," murmured the Commander of the English forces.
"I suppose it can't be helped—the Admiralty is responsible, ana
theoretically, it is nothing to us."
The Chief of the Staff bowed and smiled. His superior continued,
"And now, how about the Cavalry—have we six regiments thrown
forward as scouts Ч"
"Not perhaps in the field—but on paper," replied the subordinate.
"Well, that should avoid a surprise. Go on,—what more?"
"We have the right number of troops, the proper amount of
transport, and the necessary supply of ammunition, as you will see
Sir, by looking at this return."
'' It seems all right," replied the General, glancing at the document.
"Have all these statistics been verified?"
"WeU, not exactly," returned the Chief of the Staff. "You see,
we can only count upon a general average. When we tried the force
in the field at Aldershot, we did the same. There we employed sub-
stitutes for the real things, boot brushes for rations, soap for ammu-
nition, and it answered very well."
"Has every regiment its own baggage-waggons?"
"Certainly—at least on paper."
"And its proper amount of ball-cartridges?"
"Certainly—on paper."
"Then, after so much careful foresight, we are bound to beat the
enemy."
The Chief of the Staff was on the eve of giving an answer,
when a disturbance outside the tent caused him hurriedly to quit his
senior's presence.
The General waited for a little while, and then, growing im-
patient, repeated his question peevishly,—
"Then we are bound to beat the enemy?"
"Certainly—on paper," was the reply, spoken in broken English;
and, five seconds later, the theoretical vanquished had arrested his
theoretical conqueror.
"HalloI I say! what are you after?" cried the astonished
British General, in accents of the greatest wonder. "Don't you
know that this defeat of the English Army is utterly impossible?"
"Certainly," replied the Foreigner, as he spiked all the guns he
could lay his hands upon, helped himself to the treasure-chest, and
hauled down the British Flag—"certainly it is impossible—on paper !''

How oft the vision of the Lion's shadow
Makes him retreat with slowreluctant lurch!
Beware! The furtive eye, the smothered
growl,
Betray the fact that Bruin 's on the prowl.
PATH-CAKE, PATTI-CAKE.—"Home, sweet
home" made Patti-cake, value £500, was
presented to the Swansea Hospital by Madame
PATTI, who sang for the benefit of this insti-
tution. Among the artistes who "gave their
services," on this occasion were, according
to the Times' report, "Mr. JOHIT THOMAS,
of the Welsh Harp, "Signor TITO MATTEI,"
who sang "О dear, What can the Mattel
be?" and played on the Ti-to-tum, and
"Mr. AUGUSTUS SPALDING," who also, it is
to be presumed, kindly "gave his services."
Will this gentleman, hitherto we believe a
distinguished amateur histrion, now go on the
operatic stage as SIGNOR^AUGUSTINO SPAÍ-
DINI? Finally, Sir HUSSET VIVIAN, repre-
senting the Hospital Committee, presented
Madame PATH with her own portrait by
,S \.vr, R.A., os a sort of plea-Sant memorial
of the occasion. Yery amiable conduct on
the part of a Welsh Hussey.

THE ORACLE OF ARGYLL.
Written after the Great Duke's speech in the
House of Lords, August 19i/t, 1886.
AIR :—Mary of Argyll.
I HAVE heard the bantam flinging,
His challenge to the morn;
I.have seen his comb up-springing,
Red as poppy 'midst the corn.
But a louder crow has cheer'd me,
When MACALLUM MORE arose,
I have seen a crest that 's ruddier,
And beheld a cockier nose.
'Twas thy voice, my canny CAMPBELL,
And thy high omniscient smile,
That have made the Lords a Delphi,
For the Oracle of Argyll!
Though thy voice hath lost some sweetness,
And thine eye its brighter blue;
Though thy step may lack old fleetness,
And thy hair its flaming hue;
Still to me, thou art a marvel,
'Midst the Peers etui peerless known,
I 've admired thee for thy modesty,
But not for that alone.
I have watched thy ways, MACALLUM,
And 'tis clear our Saxon isle,
Holds no Crichton half so clever,
As the Oracle of Argyll!
SICILY AJTD CYCLOPS.—It is proposed to
bore a tunnel under the Straits of Messina.
Truly, a gigantic undertaking. But Sicily

[Dr. WiTHBRS-MooRB, recently speaking at
the meeting of the British Medical Association at
Brighton, deprecated the spread of the higher
education of women, as unfitting them for the
duties of maternity.]
HERE 's man a strange concocter
Of new rules for female life,
Women, says this daring Doctor,
Should keep clear of mental strife.
'Mid the audience assembled
There on Brighton's famous shore,
Cultured ladies must haye trembled
At the words of
Women should be wives and mothers,
That's their duty, so he said;
Not competing with their brothers,
Reading with an aching head.
Marriage only should content all
British maidens, high and low;
Cramming them is detrimental,
ftuoth our Brighton Medico.
WITHERS-MOORE, your sage address is
Very sensible it seems;
Bat each lady who professes
Culture will emit shrill screams.
You'll be scorned, denounced and scolded,
But a day may still come, when
Girls will do as girls of old did,
And devote themselves to men!

A VERY BAD SCOTCH JOKE.
WHO says the North Britons have no sense of humour? At Dum-
fries a Ladies' Committee, acting on behalf of the poor, appealed to
the Local Authority against the shocking state of the dwellings of the
lower classes—hovels let out at exorbitant rates, and without water
or the means of decency—but without success. Upon this, one of
their number—a true Sister of Charity—addressed a formal letter of
complaint to that body, of which the following is an extract :—
"Hitherto the efforts of the Committee have been utterly in vain. Up to
the present moment nothing has been done. In addition, I may add that in
the house in the Coffee Close mentioned as having had sickness in it for two
months, ill-health still affects that unfortunate family, the mother having
had an illness since, and being in poor health at the present time; further,
that the house in English Street, possessed by a Magistrate, and let at £10
per annum, has had its rent (at Whitsunday) increased to £10 10«. per
annum, without the introduction of water or any other sanitary conve-
nience."
And how was this piteous tale met P With " laughter!" And so
the petty tradesmen and owners of house property at Dumfries
constituting the " Local Authority" grin and do nothing while sick-
ness and suffering pave the way to death! Surely these contemptible
chucklers cannot be men—they must be laughing hyœnas!

RESCUE FOR RICHMOND.
AT least some Vestrymen are not blockheads, or perverse oppo-
nents of progress, or reckless wasters of public money. There is salt
in the land yet, and the savour of its good sense is shown in the
Vestry-Hall at Richmond, Surrey.
What Londoner has not seen, and what foreigner has not^heard
of, the beauties of the view from Richmond Hill, and its world-
famed glorious Terrace? But the speculative builder threatens it
with his abominations unless the Local Government Board in its
wisdom and paternal power rules otherwise, and permits the plucky
Richmond Vestry to purchase the Bucclench Estate, of nearly twelve
acres, as they propose to do, for £30,000. Where are the Open Spaces
Committee of the City Corporation? Here is a chance for them to
be at once truly Conservative and genuinely Liberal. Certet,
£30,000 is a respectable sum for a little go-ahead town like Richmond
to put down for the purchase of even one of the loveliest spots in
England, to be kept green and public for ever for the benefit of the
town, but also for the benefit of Londoners. Let Londoners there-
fore lend a helping hand, through the City Corporation which has
preserved Burnham Beeches from the barbarous bricks and mortar.
There may be several Richmonds in the field, but only one Rich-
mond-on-the-ffill; and should the speculative builder triumph, this
lovely site in Surrey would indeed be a surry sight.
At Richmond Vestry Hall, next Friday, the Local Government
Board Inspector will hear the pros and cons of the case, including the
evidence of the foolish ultra economist, who, to save a sixpence for
his own miserable pocket (by way of rate), would barter away the
fair fame of Richmond Hill. Speak up while there is time! In the
name of all the Maids of Honour, for the sake of the Lass of Rich-
mond Hill, Mr. Punch raises the cry of Rescue for Richmond!
Strange 1
SIB WILLIAM HARCOURT, after telling CAJnraro's celebrated story
of the painter who could paint nothing but red lions, pointed the
moral at Her Majesty's Government and its many Commissions.
What is now called the "Government of Red Lions," liked Sir
WILLIAM'S waggish tale so little, that they would not even "roar"
at it. BottomTumself would have done better than this.
CHICAGO CONVENTIONALITIES.
THE Fenian Leaguers met in their Irish-American thousands.
Worth noting that one Rev. GEORGB PEPPER, a Methodist Minister,
not an Irish Roman Catholic Priest, came out very strongly, and
took Heaven to witness that, if there were a call from Ireland to
their brethren in America to come over and help them, there would
be one pulpit—his own, so he might have said one " pepper-box"—
vacant in New York. He was quite ready to go over and give the
Saxons pepper. A gentleman from New Jersey, who seemed more
fitted for an old-fashioned strait-waistcoat than a new Jersey,—one
Mr. M'ADOO—was rebuked by the President for making М'Авоо
about nothing. Mr. DAVITT professed sentiments of the utmost
friendship and esteem for Mr. FDTEBTY, and then they both had a
jolly good row together, in which DAVITT was doughty, and FINEBTT
was floored.
That the meeting should have been held in the Musió Hall was of
good augury for the harmony of the proceedings.
Doing the Impossible.

the Western Division of Belfast.]

whether in or out of the season. They are provided with excellent
covert within the groves of the Academy in the grounds of Burling-

CHURCHILLS 'ALL; OB, ALL CHURCHILLS.
(Designed by Sir Wm. U , after a celebrated Picture in "Punch," October 25, 1884.)
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House (if Commons, Thursday, August 19.—Both Houses met
again to-day, avowedly for despatch of business. This greatly
furthered by meeting of LORD CHANCELLOR, and four other Peers,
disguised .as usual. To them enter SPEAKER, Sergeant-at-Arms
with mace, and Chaplain, with heads of a sermon that they never
let him deliver.
"Don't know how it is," the Rev. Gentleman says, " but congrega-
tion always disperses when they see me put my right hand to my
tail-pocket. But I have 'em at prayers."
Had 'em to-day by the hundreds. Everybody on the look-out for
seats; at the corner if possible, anywhere else when these were gone.
CHAPLIN taken up corner seat below Gangway, the one which
RANDOLPH would nave appropriated if he hadn't come into his
inheritance. Curious to see how, when Ministers took their seats,
they glanced askance at CHAPLIN.
"He means mischief, I fancy," HICKS-BEACH tremulously
whispered in RANDOLPH'S ear. "Suppose he gets SCLATEH-BOOTH
and CAVENDISH-BENTINCK to follow him? There's a new Fourth
Party made, and we '11 have to look out for squalls." RANDOLPH
laughed; but the laughter had a hollow sound, and his pensive
cheek grew momentarily paler.
Newly-elected Ministers sworn in, RANDOLPH coyly leading off.
Sorry to take the pas of HICKS-BEACH, but some one must go first.
RANDOLPH cheered, but not more than CHARLIE BERESFORD, and not
as much as ASHHEAD-BARTLETT. CHARLIE'S walk down the House
always gives one curious sensation that the floor is heaving like the
quarter-deck of ship in breeze. "Come aboard, Sir?" he said to
the SPEAKER when he lay-to off the table. "Order! Order!" cried
the SPEAKER. "Thank you, Sir, I will," he replied, and sheered off
to the refreshment bar. As for ASHMEAD-BARTLETT, House evidently
recognises in him prop of the Ministry. Cheers from both sides
greeted his advance to the table. RANDOLPH had better look out.
Proceedings on the whole rather dull. House irreverently laughed
when SPEAKER calling on "CHANCELLOR of EXCHEQUER," RANDOLPH
appeared at the table. But he, with great gravity, declined to see
the joke. Addressed House with dignified manner, and sat down
without calling anybody a rodent. Depressing effect upon the
House. Proceedings only partially relieved by discovery of brown-
Siper parcel, and this happened too late to be thoroughly effective,
ouse empty; Mr. MILMAN having completed work at table, passing
out, saw brown-paper parcel on bench where Irish Members hod most
thickly clustered. To send for Police matter of half a moment.
Police came, and "took it up," under personal supervision of
Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms. Parcel carnea at arm's-length into
Lobby. "It 's ticking, I feel it's ticking," said the agitated Police-
man. Evidently no time to be lost. The more it ticked the nearer
was the moment at which explosion would occur. Brown-paper
parcel dropped into bucket of water, and then triumphantly examined.
Turned out to contain broken bits of iron. Merely a sample of the
kind of argument current in recent Belfast controversy. An Irish
Member thought good thing to submit it to the inspection of the
House. Quite irate at Policeman who put parcel in bucket. Talks
of raising question of privilege.
Butiness done.—Address moved.

[AUGUST 28, 1886.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Friday.—JOSEPH Gibus long known to his friends aa subtle
humorist. To-night gave taste of his quality to new House. SEXTON
been returned for two Irish constituencies. Election petition pending
in one. SPEAKER, therefore, a fortnight ago told him he must await
decision in Sligo before deciding for which place he shall sit. To-
night JOEY В., with pince-nez airily dangling from his forefinger,
and document in hand, gives notice for the issue of a writ for Sfigo,
SEXTON, he says, having decided to sit for Belfast, SPEAKEB points
out that Motion cannot Ъе made for reasons communicated to SEXTON
and familiar to JOSEPH GILLIS. JOSEPH said never a word in reply.
But, regarding his expressive countenance, it was clear to read his
response.
"Really, now, and was that so? Well, SPEAKER was sure to be
right, and if he (JOSEPH) had only known this, nothing would have
induced him to trouble SPEAKER to make a public statement on the
subject."
Having made this clear—"much after the manner of Mr. Quilp
paying deference to Mrs. Jinnitcin," as
HARCOURT observed—JOSEPH covered his
face with his copy of the Orders, and
audibly chuckled.
After this, debate on Address resumed.
HARCOTTKT madelively speech, which from
time to time took the form of conversa-
tion with RANDOLPH. Leader of House
continually bobbing up and
down, interposing remarks.
"This won't do," said old
Mr. PUGH, regarding young
Leader critically. GLAD-
STONE used to be easy to
draw, but he was adaman-
tine rook compared with
RANDOLPH, who is more like
a parched pea in a frying-
pan than the Leader of the
House of Commons. I re-
member how my old friend
PAU used to sit and let people
rave around him, and so did
DIZZY. RANDOLPH, to start
with at least, should never
take his seat on Treasury
Bench without having an [eight-pound weight in either trouser-
pocket."
.—Adjourned Debate on the Address.

"This won't do!"
"GETTING ON SWIMMINGLY!"
FROM the Times' record of the Royal Humane Society's recent
awards—" A bronze medal was bestowed on Mr. HEHMANN VEZIN,
of the Opéra Comique, for the following gallant act: On the 18th ult.
while at St. Margaret's Bay, Dover, Mr. VEZIN saw a man struggling
in the sea, and apparently drowning twenty-five feet from the shore.
He, at once, only divesting himself of his coat, plunged in, dived,
and succeeded in rescuing the man, who, however, subsequently
succumbed from the shock."—Bravo, Mr. VEZIN, by far the best part
he has ever played !" 'Tie not in mortals to command success," and
though he most thoroughly deserved it, he did not achieve it.
How often have not his unaided efforts gone far to saving a piece
from utter shipwreck? And how Mr. WILSON BARRETT must regret
that, owing to the unavoidable accident of having to be present
somewhere else at the moment, he was not "on the scene" of the
great sensation Drama of All in the Downs, or St. Margaret's Say.
Brayvo, VEZIN! We hope he had some dry goods handy, and that
he found his coat when he returned to shore.
The "Bitter" Cry.
SIB WILFRID LAWSON on the Bench says,
I will not grant a licence to sell beer."
'Here
As Magistrate his conduct is not ilawless,
Let 's change his title to " Sir WILFUL LAWLESS."
"Off with his Head!»
WE read the following startling announcement in the Athenteum ;—
"Sir JOHN SA VILE LUMLBY has given to the British Museum hie fine head
and fore-part of a horse from a chariot group which was dug up lately at
Civita Lavinia (Lanuvium)."
It is certainly a most generous gift. But we cannot help wonder-
ing what Sir JOHN will do without his head, and what the Authorities
of the British Museum will do with it, now they have it.

MUSICAL PERIPATETICS.
THE Promenade Concerts are designed to suit every shade of
musical taste. But on Wednesdays the first cart of the pro-
gramme is exclusively devoted to
strains which are termed "classical,'1
that is to say, sufficiently high-class-
ical to be worthy a place in serious
music. Last Wednesday's Concert
was very largely attended by many
to whom the announcement "clas-
sical " was a distinct attraction.
Among the best features of the
First Part was Miss JOSEPHINE
LAWRENCE'S rendering on the piano
of a BEETHOVEN Concerto. Though
at times overweighted by the band,
who did not play so well together in
this as in some subsequent numbers,
Miss LAWRENCE rattled the ivoriee
with a precision and execution that
were in the highest degree creditable.
Next followed Madame ENHieuEZ,
whose full round contralto voice
elicited most deserved enthusiasm in
HANDEL'S " Lascia ch'io pianga" but
she was ill-advised in complying
_ - _. .,„.,,, with the rowdy demand for an
Crowe on «a Classical Night.» encore A Canzonetta for band, by
BENJAMIN GODARD, though refreshingly delicate and quaint, was, on
the other hand, ill-appreciated.
Mr. BARTON McGucKiN sanç, with orchestral accompaniment, the
"Prize Song" from Die Meutersänger. He gave the voluptuous
music very well, though the instrumentalists sometimes struggled
for supremacy with the soloist. He, too, was approvingly yelled at
by the enthusiasts in the gallery, and, after holding out till victory
seemed in his grasp, weakly surrendered at the last moment, and
sang the whole thing over again better than before. But all this
wasted time sadly and indefensibly. If not undesirable on other
grounds, the practice of spinning out the first part of a Concert is
grossly unfair to the artists appearing in the second. And to say
that encores cannot always be resisted, is, in the simple language of
the East, "bosh."
The Symphony in D, by ANTON DVORAK, concluded the First Part,
and its performance, especially that of the first and last movements,
reflected equal credit on the patience of Conductor, Orchestra, and
the audience. The A Uegro was played finely; some passages in it
recall the "Hallelujah Chorus." The Adagio was rather dry work
—very long-drawn. The Finale closes with a massive sequence of
ingenious and striking chords, bringing the Symphony to a not
particularly pleasant, though hardly unwelcome conclusion.
After the solid meat come the sweets. And so, early in the Second
Part, Mr. CROWE'S new Vocal Waltz, "Little Sailors," was heard
for the fourth time in public. The principal melody of "Little
Sai/ors" is so like that of "See-Saur," and "Fairie Voices," or
rather, so like a combination of the two, that the resemblance can
hardly be accidental. Having got a good idea, Mr. CROWE evidently
means to develope it. His motto is, doubtless, "When found, make
a note of." His "Mine To-day" means a particularly rich mine
for the future. But the question becomes a grave one how ninny
more of these waltzes is he goinç to write? Is he merely working
on the Three Years' System, or is each succeeding Season to revive
the ashes of the past? These are solemn thoughts. It must not be
supposed, however, that there is no novelty in the new waltz. On
the contrary: the introduction and the last number (No. 4) are not
only extremely effective and pretty, but abo fairly original. The
words are rather queer at times, and the promise—addressed to
"Sweethearts and Wives "—
"When we are far away at sea,
We '11 drink then to thee,"
seems made rather in the interests of rhyme than of grammar, but
"Little Sailors" answers very well on the whole, and the youths
and maidens of Mr. STEDMAN'S Choir make a pretty picture in their
nautical costumes. Subsequently a new and capable vocalist, Misa
M. LUCILLE SAUNDERS, sang an air from La Favorita. Owing to
the lateness of the hour, a SaltareUo by GOUNOD was passed over to
make way for her. But even thus, thanks to the encores in the first
part, many were unable to wait till the end of the eong, and among;
those compelled to leave was NIBELUNOLET.
PERTINENT то A PEER.—Why did our latest Viscount refuse,
angrily, to be called Lord WASHINGTON ?—Because he is accustomed
to Ъе CKOSS.
TO COUKESrOHDENTS—In no caae can Contributions, whether US., Printed Hatter, or Drawings, be returned, unleu accompanied
by a Stamped and Directed Envelope or Cover. Copies of MS. should be.kept by the Senden.

PLAY OUT OF PLACE.
//

DEAB MA. PUNCH,—I have discovered a nasty spot in one of the
lungs of London—as you
are the Doctor to cure all
evils, I trust you will take
up the case.
I re-visited the neigh-
bourhood of dear old Re-
gent's Park last week,
strolled through the Zoo,
to renew the acquaintance
of all my friends there,
deserted in the "out of
Town" Season, and long-
ing in vain, alas! for their
day in the country. It was
early, the Park was deserted
—except by the birds, and
here and there laughing
children with their nurses.
Everything was pleasant,
во fresh and green, and
free and easy, unlike the
West-End "lungs."
I sat myself down on a
bench. Shut out from the
madding crowd, one could
breathe in comfort. I re-
called LOOKER'S lines in
praise of Piccadilly—that

crowded thoroughfare,
dusty and noisy, and while
trying to fit them in to suit
the beautiful E cene around
me, I nodded, and fell asleep.
Bang! I 'm awake ! —
what's that? A cannon-
ball hit me in the back?
I'm all of a heap on the
grass, my hat one way, my
umbrella another — and I
nowhere! or, where am I?
"Dear me, am I dreaming?
—have I been carried by a
shot? (Volunteers do prac-
tice in the Park.) "Was it
a Suburban Race Meeting!!
Yes, it muet be, and one of
i low order. And yet this
is surely Regent's Park I
'»Thank you, Sir!"—
"Tha-a-nk y-o-o-n !" —
Th-a-a-n-k y-o-o-o-u!"
I pick myself up. Is it the
monkey's half - holiday—
res I they are imitating boys
playing at »ticket. Their
cages are oloet at hand.
VOb. XOT.

Bang! Another blow!! This time I receive the enemy's blow as
an Englishman should—in front; it brings me up standing—I see
all! The monkeys are boys—the cages are practising nets, and the
balls came off the bats! A nurse in charge of five children is under
fire-^in terror that some of her little ones may be hit and killed—
and it is a wonder they are not. I gallantly cover her retreat, for
no Park-keeper is to be seen. Then I turnea my attention to what
I thought—when half dazed, but not altogether wrong—was a corner
of a low race-meeting, or gipsy encampment. Here is a sketch, Sir,

made on the spot, it certainly was like both, dirty unfinished tents,
casks, rubbish and rags, something boiling, and some people brawl-
ing, the grass all worn, and the walk cut up! An eye-sore, a
disgrace, Sir I
A somewhat artistically-built kiosk stands a hundred yards, or so,
away. If the mass of orioketers want another, by all means let them
have it, and drive the unsightly tent-jobbers out of the Park.
If this sort of thing is allowed by officiais in charge, then. Sir, I
venture to think the sketch heading this letter, "What it wiu come
to," will be an actual illustration of fact. Yours truly,
STUBMIE STOMPS.
A SUGGESTION,—Appoint Mr. CLIFFORD LLOTD Governor of the
Islands we 've just annexed, and make Mr. POPE HENNESSEY Prince
of Bulgaria, on the first opportunity.

"DISENCHANTMENT."
Miss ROBDÍSOW, a writer young and fresh,
Here tells a story full of thought and pow'r.
The pen that gave us Mr. Butler'» Ward
Gains strength and point in this its newest work:
Artistic, earnest, full of sympathy and life-y
"We welcome with a cheer this Young Recruit,
And feel assured we shall not look in vain
For work e'en better from her skilful hand!
«LIVING PARIS."
'Tis certain while "ALB" knows his Paris by heart,
He 's able his knowledge to clearly impart!
He writes of Society, salons, and shops,
Of poets and players, and open-air " nops ;"
Of cafés and dinners discourseth he well,
Of restaurant, theatre, club, and hotel;
Of churches and politics, billiards and chess,
Of manners and monuments, fashion and drtss —
A difficult t hin» 'tis indeed to find out
A subject Parisian he writes not about:
All lovers of Paris should hasten to scan
This Guide.on_a new and original plan!
"A BOOK OF THE RUiVNING BROOK AND OF STILL
WATERS."
IN Lady COLIN CAMPBELL'S clever book,
Cheap fish for food she stoutly advocates;
At " fish-rings " runs a tilt, and clearly shows
The undeveloped food-stores of our land:
She knows her subject, and with pleasant pen
Indites a volume pleasant to be read!
"CHAPTERS IN EUROPEAN HISTORY."
"Chapters in European History," rarely
Have weighty matters handled been more fairly,
Than these by W. 8. LILLY. Here
They are discussed, sans favour, and sans fear.

Pictures to paint, but graphic, plain and true.
Such being Mr. LILLY s work, t* were silly,
For us with over-praise to paint the Lily.

the Diocese was considerably recreated during the highly successful

taken the form of a little extra glass, is natural enough.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A WATER COURSE.
IV.
A Consultation—A Body—The Prisoner—Body again—Anxious
moment—Decision—Rehearsal—Launched.
WHENEVER I call upon a Doctor professionally, with a view to con-
sulting him ahout my own health, I am invariably diverted from what
ought to be the all-absorbing subject of my visit by an overpowering
interest in his health. It seems,—that is, so it strikes me at the
moment,—so dreadfully selfish and egotistical when two men are
together for one of them, to have no other subject of conversation but
himself, his history in the past and his manner of life in the present,
and so I cannot avoid discarding my own health, putting that topic

aside as one which we can take up at any moment when we've
exhausted others of more pressing importance; and the Doctor, spe-
cially if he be one whom I am consulting for the first time, becomes
at once the object of my sympathetic curiosity. I want to know all
about himself, first; and when we 've done that, then we will take up
myself as a secondary consideration. If the medical man is an old
friend, we have so much of common interest between us that it is a long
time before we get at the special object of my visit. On this occasion,
however, I am taken by the Cherubic Dr. HAMMOND PUTTENEY to see
Dr. REM of Royat: and as they have to discuss me as a " case," it is
for me to listen and, if necessary, answer questions. Once in Dr. REM'S
professional sanctum, Dr. HAMMOND PUTTENEY ceases to be cherubic,
puts on his gold spectacles (both Doctors wear gold-rimmed spec-
tacles) in a way that gives him a grave and anxiously scientific air,
and seats himself at such a distance from me, as conveys the idea
that from this moment until the close of the interview we are no
longer on our ordinary equal and friendly footing, and his entire
manner gives me clearly to understand that for the time being I
must look upon himself and Dr. REM as two superhuman intelli-
gences, and myself as a mere passive body, conscious, but in
a state of suspended animation. Then, as Dr. REM seat«
himself at his desk, with pen and paper
and a book before him, the scene seems to
undergo a change, and it occurs to me that
he looks like a benevolent country Magis-
trate hearing a charge in his own private
room, and that Dr. HAMMOND PUTTENEY
figures in the scene as the constable who
brings the charge, keeping
an eye on me, who am, as it
were, the prisoner.
"Now!" says Dr. REM,
taking up his pen and look-
ing in the direction of Dr. /
PUTTENEY. Whereupon Dr. /
PTTTTENEY. in his character ^-
of constable, commences his
charge against me, giving
his evidence " from informa-
tion he has received," i.e.,
from myself. I listen
calmly, and, as he is stating
the case fairly and succinctly, I see no reason for interrupting or
contradicting him. Occasionally I nod affirmatively, or put in an
adverb intended to qualify, or intensify some of his statements.
His whole testimony he delivers with an air of deference due to the
presence of the elder Doctor, and yet with something of the pride of
a discoverer. It is in this latter vein that, having finished his
evidence, he ceases to appear as the constable, and resuming his
original character of scientific Doctor, gives his own opinion on the
case, which he announces as something that will take Dr. REM by
surprise, and ultimately astonish the faculty generally.

Dr. Bern.
"You examine him yourself." says the Cherubic One, nodding in
the direction where I am seated, but not otherwise recognising my
existence except as a body; "you'll see he 's anœmic."
Dr. REM professes himself sceptical, but at once puts the assertion
to the test.
"Well," he exclaims, drawing a long breath, after having satisfied
himself by a thorough examination, during which I siniply remain a
body, offering no resistance, making no remarks. "Well, I own I
am astonished. Yes," he adds, emphatically, and yet with a slight
indication of unwillingness at being compelled by truth to corroborate
Dr. PUTTENEY'S assertion, " he is anœmic."
They do not talk to me, but of me, and an expression of surprise
escaping me, which is an attempt on my part at joining in the con-
sultation, passes as entirely unheeded as does the clock striking the
quarter.
Mentally I say to myself, "So l'm anémique, am I! I see—no man's
anémie but my own. Good! What next Y Go it, Gentlemen!"
But Dr. PUTTENEY having already scored, has nothing more to
observe, and waits with a self-satisfied and critical air to hear his
senior's verdict.
Dr. REM asks me a few questions, but as my answers only confirm
Dr. PUTTENEY'S previous account of me, they fail to throw any fresh
light on the subject, and Dr. REM enters the whole case in his note-
book, considers it carefully, closes it, pushes it away as though its
presence bothered him, sits back in his chair, and, after an awful
silence of at least half a minute, during which I begin to wonder,
rather nervously, whether he has hit upon something so fatal in my
case as to render any treatment whatever utterly useless, and
whether he is only meditating how best to break this unwelcome
intelligence to me, he turns to Dr. PUTTENEY, and, to my infinite
relief, observes that he has every hope of putting me aU right—
ultimately, and states what his plan is to be. Dr. PUTTENEY ven-
tures to suggest some alterations, but as he has had his turn, and
played his part, Dr. REM only courteously considers his proposi-
tions in order to as courteously dismiss them, preferring his own
"traitement," the particulars of which he will let me have a little
later this morning, when he will introduce me to the Director of the
Bath Establishment, and put me au courant with everything neces-
sary.
We are on the point of being bowed out, when Dr. PUTTENEY,
smoothing his hat in a nervous manner, asks diffidently, "Don't you
think he may take the douche nasale f"
Dr. REM hesitates, and regards me dubiously. This part of the
interview reminds me of the time when a relation used to come for
me at school and ask the Head Master if, always supposing I had
been a good boy, I mightn't have a half-holiday. How anxiously I
used to await the master's answer, and how tremblingly I noted
his hesitation, as he looked in my face inquiringly, as much as to
say, "Shall I recall the fact that you were not a good boy yesterday
—that you were punished the day before—that you put jam in
another boy's hat last Thursday—and for these courtesies, am I to
grant you a half-holiday?"
That I am to take an ordinary bath every day, and to drink so
much water regularly, seems to me to be so monotonous an affair that
I shall really be glad if the Doctor will vary it with a douche nasale.
From my former experiences at Aix-les-Bams, Aix-la-Chapelle, and
La Bourboule, there is nothing so wearying as the mechanical order
of the treatment, and it is therefore quite a little holiday for the
patient to be prescribed a gargarisme, or a douche, or a vapeur, or a
massage. So when Dr. REM'S eyes meet mine, I am conscious of a
beseeching look in my own, as if imploring him not to condemn me
to a terrible unbroken monotony. With joy I recognise a gleam of
lity in his glance as, with a benevolent smile, he turns towards
)r. PUTTENEY, and says, "Yes, he may take the nasal douche."
"And," inquires Dr. PUTTENEY, with increasing diffidence, as if
he feared the result of his temerity in asking too much all at once,
but he '11 risk it,—just as my relation coming to fetch me at school
having gained a half-holiday, would request the Master to stretch
one point more of discipline in my favour, and allow mo to return
after the hour of "lock-up,"—"Mightn't he take the pulverisation
lateron?"
Dr. REM regards me thoughtfully. He evidently considers we are
presuming on nis ^previous concession: besides, if he agrees to this
addition to his original prescription, it is no longer his treatment,
but his in collaboration with Dr. PUTTENEY. He is on the point of
refusing (I am sure of it) and the Cherubic Doctor is already begin-
ning to be sensible of having gone a little too far, when a brilliant
idea of a compromise strikes Dr. REM, who quite brightens up as he
says to the Medical Cherub, "I'll tell you what he shall do! He
shall take the douche nasale and the pulverisation alternately," and
thereupon he sits down, triumphantly, and makes a note of this in hie
book. The Cherubic Doctor oeams on me through his spectacles, as
much as to say, " There! you wouldn't have got all these luxuries if
it hadn't been for me!" I feel immensely relieved and satisfied
with the prospect of a pleasing variety in the treatment, and Dr.
REM who has several patients waiting in the ante-room, bows us out

во courteously, and says "Au revoir" so reassuringly, that I already
feel more than half cured of whatever is the matter with me. I differ
from him as to the symptoms being at all gouty, but I keep this
opinion, being an unprofessional one, and not asked for at the con-
sultation, to myself.
The Cherubic Doctor, who outside Dr. HEM'S, and away from
business, becomes at once the gay young Anglo-German student out

for a holiday, is in ecstacies of delight at the permission granted me
to take a douche nasale and a pulverisation.
"Do you know how to manage 'em? " he asks.
Yes, I am on friendly terms with "pulvérisation," but to the
douche natale I am a stranger.
"Come along then, I'll show you," he exclaims, joyfully, and,
as if we were off for a real good lark, away he hurries me to the
Etablissement.
We enter a room, the aspect of which is familiar to me, as it is
fitted up like the pulverisation department at La Bourboule, and he
introduces me to the attendant nose-doucher, who fits me with a
small glass tube all to myself (I thought he was going to meaure my
nose for it, but he guesses the size, and has one ready to hand), ties
on a waterproof bib, and I take my seat at a tap.
"Can you play on this pipe?" asks the Cnerubic Doctor, in the
character of Hamlet.
"My liege. I can," 1 reply, rashly presuming on my acquain-
tance with the pulverisation process. In another minute I have
douched my eyes, sent the water with four-horse engine power up
my sleeve, into my mouth, and everywhere but up my nose, and in
fact made a nice mess
of it. The Cherubic
Doctor watching me,
now steps forward.
"This is the way,"
he says, and guides
my hand with the
glass tube in it, "and
don't forget," he
adds, "to keep your
left hand on the tap,
so as to regulate the
force."
For awhile I re-
_ member the injunc-
=^|f tion; I turn it on full;
I it operates wonder-
fully, and I feel as if
I had filled my head
with water, and would
have water on the
brain in another
second, but for its
running out as quick-

put his head down
over my shoulder to see that I am carrying out his directions
exactly, and at this moment, pausing in the operation to tell him my
sensations, I remove the pipe, but forgetting to turn the tap, the
water goes without the slightest warning with full force right at the
Cherubic Doctor's spectacles, and gives him such a startlingly unex-
pected douche as knocks him back into the arms of the attendant.
There is no harm done, however, and here ends the first lesson on the
douche nasale pipe.
Coming out on our road to breakfast we meet Dr. REM, who
introduces me to a most courteous gentleman, M. CHASSAIT, the
Acting Director of the place, or Commander of the Bath, who
welcomes me to the Baths, and presents me with the freedom of
the Casino. Now I am fairly launched on my Water-Course.
PROPOSITIONS AND RIDERS.
FOE the nth time Mr. Punch appeals to GEORGE RANGEE, to the
Board of Works, to Public Commissioners of all sorts, to the Police
Authorities, and to
all concerned in the
management and ar-
rangement of the
Parks and Kensington
Gardens, to take into
consideration during
this present recess,
plans for improving
and developing the
opportunities for
equestrian exercise so
advantageously of-
fered bythese locali-
ties. Why is the
rider to be condemned
to the everlasting three-quarters of a mile, up and down, or round
and round, of Rotten Row, its tributary ride by the Knightsbridge
Barracks, the miserable four feet wide tan line, one-third round the
Park, and the connecting " bit of soft" between the Powder Maga-
zine and the dreary ride on the Bays water side? The monotony of
this offers little real refreshment to the jaded working-man, whether
he come from bench, bar, study, studio, or other closed workshops;
while if that useless ditch which divides Kensington Gardens fro»
Hyde Park were filled up or bridged over, equestrians could pass to
and fro, the Gardens themselves could be planned out into charming
rides under shady trees, going this way and that way, North and
South, East and West, and a short means of communication could be
at once opened up between the West Kensingtonians and the Bays-
waterians, who have now between them a broad walk, barred against
all comers on horseback by huge iron gates.
Mr. Punch rather thinks he has neard of certain plans which
have been in existence a considerable time, which go into all the
details of this scheme, and provide for all its difficulties. Let these
plans and maps be brought out of the pijreon-holes, well dusted,
and submitted to the H.R.H. the Prince of WALES, who has only to
recommend their immediate consideration, and his own approval of
the idea, for the matter to be at once taken up and dealt with by
"GEORGE RANGER" and the other "Authorities." This would be
a popular move for the popular Prince, to whom it is earnestly com-
mended by H.R.H.'s sage privy councillor and loyal well-wisher,

Improvement in Kensington Gardens, to be
called" Punch s Ride."
ENTERTAINING ODDS AND ENDS.— Messrs. MASKEYLINE AND COOKE
(and their lead has been followed in other places of amusement) have
recently introduced a new feature into their Entertainment at the
Egyptian Hall in the shape of a " Disappearing Lady." A young
person, of prepossessing appearance, and engaging manners, is pre-
sented to the audience by Mr. BERTRAM (the well-beloved rival of
Monsieur VEHBECX), and then invited to seat herself upon a chair,
resting upon a spread-out newspaper. Having graciously accepted
the proffered courtesy, she is immediately enveloped from head to
foot in a black peignoir, and, hi! presto! she has disappeared! It
is scarcely necessary to explain that this is done by wires, or electri-
city, or— something. However .it is certainly odd.
Summery suggestion for Mr. HOLLAND, Lessee of the Royal Albert
Palace, Battersea, to advertise "How to Spend a Happy Day at the
(Batter) -Sea-Side!" _
Сим GRANO.— The Times of Saturday last published the result of
an informal inquiry into the Belfast Riots, instituted by the Irish
Loyal and Patriotic Union. "Pat-ri5t-io" is an appropriate term on
this occasion. The "report" was signed by one Mr. PATTON, a
Dublin Barrister, whose summing up in certain oases, says the
Times — and quite rightly —" does not seem to be borne out by the
evidence." By the way. as some of this evidence received by Mr.
PATTON was hearsay, inadmissible in a Court of Justice, this
Dublin Barrister cannot set up for a model or PATTON Lawyer.
IN THE PRESS.— "The Editor of the Daily News— A Great
Success." Sequel to the Novel lately advertised, entitled "Lucy,
«Mistake."

THE WORD "POLTICS."
SIR,—" THE word Poltics surprises Ъу him-
self" (to quote the immortal Smorltork) more
than he ever did. I have turned, politically
speaking, a Mug-Wump, under stress of
circumstances. Do you know what that
means? Of course you do, because it 's part
of everything, which you do know. Tînt
some of your readers don't know everything.
So let me observe that a Mug-Wump, ш
politics, means somebody who doesn't believe
anybody on his oath any longer. Simple pro-
gramme, eh? and reminds one of RUSSIN.
l'it y that so many good men and true should
have been driven out of the thing altogether
by this last move, you know: but so it is.
If it pomes to games, you see, we won't play.
We luce tennis and billiards better. And I
guess England and Ireland, and Scotland and
Wales too, will be sorry for it before long.
They ain't " nations," you know, any of 'em.
But they are four races, which make one
nation, or used to. Excuse grammar; but
I 'ni angry, and so are a good many of us. If
we it ni't want to be 'a nation, I suppose we
needn't. And anyhow as England wants
Home Rule most of the four, I hope she '11
get it out of this business, and out of Sir
W. H.'s " strong knees," which enable him
to turn ten somersaults at a go, if wanted,
and that 's wonderful for his size. Sorry about
Scotland and Wales; for, rights and wrongs
apart, their vote only means that they love
a dig at the big sister England, and won't let
the chance go. The Scotch intellect be
blowed. If she 'a so sweet on Ireland, why
did she go for THEVELTAN last time, when
she knew he was dead against PAKNKI.L aa
well as she knows it now, except that Home
Rule hadn't cropped up serious, and she never
thought it would?
However, let us drop that. Yon 're fair to
everybody and always were. I'd write an
answer to the G. 0. M. only I know he won't
read it, as he says he '11 not look at any letters
while he 's away in Bavaria where the Wag-
nerites are. Perhaps when he comes back
like a Giant refreshed with Bavarian Beer
he will take a fresh view of things in
general. But if his little game is always to
have cards up his sleeve, as you, Sir, repre-
sented him in a picture just before the begin-
ning of last Session, and if he thinks this the
right sort of thing to do, and if other party
leaders begin to imitate him, then may I ask
on whom, except always on you. Sir, is a

TO BEE OR NOT TO BEE.
THE Rev. W. J. RICHARDSON, of Great
Milton Vicarage, having written to a contem-
porary, announcing that some of his bees
have recently been attempting to extract
honey from his study carpet (presumably from
the flowers figuring in its pattern), the fol-
lowing supplementary anecdotes of the brute
creation are offered for future considera-
tion:—
Intelligent Conduct of a Calf.—Some little
while ago, a cow was driven from her off-
spring, andhermilk usedfor domestic ригровез.
Shortly afterwards, her calf was found vainly
attempting to extract milk from the village
pump.
Strange Freak of a Hen.—A. toy-shop for
many days was paraded by a Cochin China
lately released from sitting on a nest of
ducks' egg's. The proprietor of the establish-
ment could not understand her partiality for
his emporium until, on stock-taking, he dis-
covered that all the Noah's Arks had been
broken open, and their contente partially re-
moved. It was subsequently ascertained that
the too-anxious hen had removed all the
wooden ducks, and placed them in safety on
a high shelf. As a basin of water was in the
shop, it is believed that the poor creature was
anxious to prevent the effigies from taking to
swimming.
Cleverness of an ElepJiant. — A fellow-
creature of Jumbo recently injured its most
prominent feature while performing in a
country circus. After the performances were
over, it broke away from tne menagerie, and
hastening to a portmanteau-seller, attempted
to procure a new and undamaged trunk.
Instinct of a Dog in a ífan-o'-War.—
Shortly before the abolition of flogging in the
Navy, a favourite colley, the property of a
naval officer appointed to a ship in which
discipline was very strict, could not be in-
duced to leave the Captain's cabin. He
employed the whole of hie time in fighting
with the cat-o'-nine-tails.
The Rev. W. J. RICHARDSOS after this
assistance will perhaps kindly oblige again.
WHEN Prince ALEXANDER was kidnapped,
the Government was placed in the hands of a
Provisional Committee, at whose head was
"Monseigneur CLEMENT, Bishop of Tirnova."
Could he cave had a more appropriate name I
Since then this Turnover Prelate has been

A MENU I LA EUSSE.
THE following "instructions" apparently emanating
from a Russian source, have found their way to 85, Fleet
Street. AB they strongly resemble certain events not
totally unconnected with Bulgaria, they are published in
the interests of those they seem to concern :—
1. The Power of England must be broken.
2. The Power of England can only be broken by depos-
ing the LORD МАТОВ oí London.
3. The LORD MAYOR of London must therefore be
deposed.
4. Three men and a boy will visit the Mansion House on
the night of the 10th of September, and insist upon the
LORD MAYOR signing a decree of abdication.
5. The services of Colonel Sir REGINALD HANSON, Hon.
Colonel of the London Militia, will if possible be secured.
If this is impracticable the Shoe Black Brigade must be
bribed to assist the three men and a boy in securing the
person of the LORD MAYOR.
6. After the LORD MAYOR has signed the decree of
abdication, he will be quickly removed in an Omnibus to
London Bridge, where he will be invited to enter a Penny
Steamboat.
7. The Penny Steamboat will immediately leave the
Pier on receiving the LORD MAYOR on board, and proceed
to the nearest Russian Port.
8. On reaching the nearest Russian Port, the LORD
MAYOR will be landed and be informed that he is at
perfect liberty to go where he pleases.
9. If the British Empire does not fall to pieces after
these occurrences, the general illumination at St. Peters-
burg will be postponed.
10. Whatever may.be the result of the above sug-
gestions, the Russian Government will repudiate all
connection with the proceedings.

SUBJECT TO AEBITEATION.
SIR,—Being much struck with a recent article in the Times,
entitled " A New Calling," wherein an anonymous Correspondent
professed to deal successfully with a pressing social evil, in pointing
out to impecunious Peers, how they might deliver themselves from
all their difficulties by adopting the profession of "Social Arbitra-
tors," I instantly advertised in a fashionable journal for business of
the kind indicated :—
A NOBLEMAN of Experience, with leisure on his hands, will be
happy to intervene and arbitrate in any painful and distressing
family difficulty or dispute, the settlement of which requires tact,
delicacy, and judgment. Terms moderate. Apply by letter to the
Earl of В., The Carlton Club, Pall Mall, S.W.
An early post brought me an answer to the above, and I found
myself by the end of the week involved in the arrangement of a very
serions and complicated family scandal, which I, however, succeeded
in bringing ultimately to a triumphant issue, to the great satisfac-
tion, I believed, of all concerned. I thereupon sent in my bill, and
following on the advice set by the suggester of "A New Calling,"
that in such a delicate matter, items would not for a moment be
thought of, I merely notified the account thus :—
"To the Earl of Bellowglasi for hit valuable services in arranging
an affair of delicacy and honour—£1000."
Imagine then, Sir, my surprise on receiving from my client, by
return of post, a letter expressing astonishment at the amount of my
claim, and requesting to be furnished with a "properly made out
detailed account," of my expenses. In the face of this indecent re-
joinder, I confess I did not feel called upon to mince matters, and
though I found some difficulty in adjusting the prices to the items,
so as to mount up to the round sum I had named off-hand, as a fair
price for my services, I soon managed to get the thing into shape,
and without more ado, dispatched the following bill of costs :—
To James John Woodruff-Smith, Esq., of 193, Russell Square,
W. C., in account with the Earl of Sellowglass, The Carlton
Club, Pall Mall, S. W.
To calling on you and receiving your instructions in this case, to
the effect that you, having latterly missed seven thousand pound
notes, which you had left loose in the pocket of your great-coat, that
usually hung m the hall, as well as a quantity of table silver, together
with a valuable Queen Anne tea-urn and cream-jug, had reason to
suspect your wife's great-uncle, who had been staying on a lengthy
visit which he showed no inclination to finish, of taking them.
Secondly, that your suspicions had been aroused against him by his
being seen entering a neighbouring pawnbroker's with a bulky port-
manteau, and from thence proceeding to the various public-houses
in the vicinity, from which he would return with a bevy of drunken
coalheavers whom he had asked to join him at dinner at your table,
thereby causing you and your household daily considerable inconve-
nience and annoyance. Thirdly, that you wished, if possible, to find
out the truth gently, not only in consequence of his great age and
irritable temper, but on account of offending his distant relatives
whom you believed would resent any direct proceedings against him,
and that you hoped, if the matter could be brought home to him to
hush it up, and get him to reside with a deaf maternal aunt, who was
to be kept in ignorance of the affair, and had undertaken to take
care of him. lo listening to and taking notes of the above. Time
and thought £170 О О
To turning over the above, and advising you thereon, to the effect
that it would be desirable to have some evidence against your great-
uncle, either by watching his movements or otherwise, and suggesting
that you should, for the purpose, give a Fancy Dress Ball, which I
would attend in disguise and take observations . . £100 О О
To attending same, and closely following about your Great Uncle,
the whole evening disguised as a Red Indian, with the result of
seeing him purloin a couple of entree dishes, and finally detecting
him in the act of endeavouring to conceal a silver soup-ladle and
fish-slice up his back, and to forcing him into the back library
together with yourself, two waiters bound to silence, a local solicitor
and a pretended policeman, and obliging him, after a fight with the
fireirons, and listening to bitter and vindictive recriminatory charges
against you and your family, to admit that he had not come by them
honestly £450 О О
To interviewing him the next day, with a view to a compromise,
by his removal in a railway omnibus to your deaf Maternal Aunt's,
seeing him placed in same in a strait-waistcoat, and thus bringing
the matter to a satisfactory conclusion ... £45 О О
To purchase of fancy dress for business as detailed above £15 15 0
To cabs, postage, sticking-plaster (necessitated by stand-up fight),
and to general incidental expenditure .... £219 5 0
Total £1000 О О
Now, Sir, will you believe that the only notice my account has
received has been the arrival of a beggarly cheque for £5, coupled
with an intimation that I ought to think myself "lucky and well
paid" to get that, and this spite my threat to publish in all its
nakedness the hideous family story submitted to my "arbitration,"
unless I speedily received the balance, which, as three days have
elapsed, and though I have put the matter in the hands of my Soli-
citors, I have heard nothing further on the subject, I accordingly do.
Asking you to give publicity to the above in your widely-read
pages, as a warning to others of my order in equally necessitous
circumstances, I beg, Sir, to subscribe myself
Yours faithfully, A PEER WHO KNOWS HIS PRICE.

BUYING GOODS ABROAD.
THE office of Mr. Punch has been inundated with correspondence on this most important
topic: the views of his almost innumerable Correspondents being respectively in favour or
against Free Trade, Fair Trade, High Trade, Low Trade, Square Trade, Sly Trade, Shy
Trade, and Any Trade. One Correspondent with the signature of "JACK" advocates "All
Trades." Several hundred-weight of the overflow of these communications Mr. Punch
has sent to his esteemed contemporary the Daily Telegraph, a few tons more he has reserved
for the delectation of his own readers. Here are some samples to begin with :—
SIR,—The Dutch, not content with taking Holland, are by their unfair competition with
us, taking the bread out of the months of British manufacturers and traders. To whatever
side we turn, the confounded Dutchman meets us with his wares. We must, forsooth, toast
our kidneys in Dutch ovens; our children play with Dutch dolls; from the windows of
countless broughams I see scowling the sable muzzles of Dutch pugs; my servants will eat
nothing but Dutch cheese (when they cannot get Gorgonzola); when they feel faint, they
swallow Dutch drops; I sent a picture-frame the other day to be regilt, and the villanons
frame-marker (of course an Italian) returned the frame covered with butch metal. Where is
this to end, Sir P Are our boys, when they go to school, to learn nothing but how to spell
Double-Dutch backwards on a Sunday? If we feel faint, are we to stimulate our exhausted
energies with Dutch courage? Yours indignantly,
Here is a gentleman even more wrathful :—
8ш,—I boil. I am all over boils. I read
nothing but Soyle's Court Guide. I am a
Soap-boiler, and I love my children, of
whom I have eleven. The soap-boiling
trade, Sir, is in a depressed state, owing to
the immense sums which we have to pay
Royal Academicians for designing Cartoons
illustrative of the beneficent properties of
soap. Under these circumstances I can only
allow my eleven children a half penny a week
each to buy lollipops with. What do they
bring back, Sir, from the sweetstuff shop?
"Bonaparte's ribs." Was Bonaparte an
Englishman, Sir P Elecampane—evidently
à lu campagne—a. French mess—French
plums. Caramels, Turkish delight, and
Spanish liquorice. Is there not sufficient
lickorice to be obtained from the sap of the
homely British birch P Could we not get
much of the lick-orice which we require from
halfpenny canes at the toy-shops P And
here is my poor little boy JOHNNIE come
home with a fearful stomach-ache through
drinking Persian sherbet at an Austrian
café, and eating penny Neapolitan ices at
the street corner. Yours, explosively,
THOMAS BOILOVEE.
Aha! the lively Gaul's turn comes
now :—
SIR,— The French have done it all.
English traders are no longer "in it."
French rolls for breakfast, French horns,
played by German bands, French polish for
our furniture, French honeysuckles from
our florists, French beans for dinner, French-
tub at our dyers. My tailor yesterday
measured me for a travelling suit of French
grey. I asked him whether it was with
pipe-clay that he was making diagrams on
my arms and legs. He replied, No, Sir;
we use French chalk."—Your despairing
Servant, C. OLNEY HATCH.
P.S.—My nursemaid took French leave
this morning, and left my eighteenth and
nineteenth children (twins) howling in a
perambulator in the centre of the square.
My fifth footman was just in time to rescue
the dear innocents from an unmuzzled
ferocious-looking French poodle.
But, soft! A more temperate epistle :—
MESSES. COCKSHY AND СнискгАвтншо
present their compliments to the Editor of
Punch and respectfully draw his attention
to the disastrous effects of German competi-
tion on English trade. They are aware of
several instances of English larks, thrushes,
and other singing birds being fed exclu-
sively on German paste. They are informed
by one of the largest sausage-makers at Cow
Cross that native saveloys are no longer able
to hold their own in consequence of the dis-
loyal concurrence of "small Germans."
Hundreds of most entertaining variety-
shows have had to close their doors in con-
sequence of the popularity of Mr. and Mrs.
GERMAN REED'S Entertainment. Messrs.
C. & C. have it likewise, on the best authority,
that at the Hotel Teutonic, in Jermyn Street,
there are none but German waiters (who all
play on the German flute): the plate is all
German silver, and the colour of the win-
dow-curtains is a deep Prussian blue. How
long is this state of things to last?
The last word, obviously, should be given
to a Lady, Place aux Damet !—
SIK,—I have this morning discharged my
laundress, in consequence of having dis-
covered that she was in the habit of
getting up my fine linen with an Italian
iron, and washing my skirts with Castile
soap. Yours, &c., A PKIMBOSE DAME.

! Suggestion for
SSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday NiyJtt, August 23.—A big House con-
sidering we can almost hear the echoes of the guns on many moors.
There is talk of some lively speaking. HABTIHGTON, it is said, will
show his hand. Certainly the Sage of Queen Anne's Gate has got
the first place, and will renew debate. Before it comes on, young
LAWSON puts pertinent questions to PLDNKET. It seems the Park
ponds are growing thick with fish. Weird stories current in Park
lodges of elderly carp being seen in the moonlight, walking arm in
arm along the sward, just to stretch their fins and get a little fresh air.
Why not thin pond population by granting permission to anglers to
take their sport? EDMOND has gone salmon-fishing to the North.
Why shouldn't 'ABET take his pleasure in the Serpentine?
PLTTNKET will tell us why. 'Аввт it appears, when he had the
chance, used to take up the turf in search of the necessary worm.
Turf in neighbourhood of ponds spoiled, and so fishing prohibited.
House laughs, but possibly neither ABET nor more desirable
disciples of ISAAK WALTON will accept explanation as perfectly
satisfactory.
The Sage of Queen Anne's Gate in excellent form. Borrowed
DILLWTN'S seat at corner of Gangway, with HABTIN<;TON just above
and CHAMBEBLAIN beyond. On ordinary occasions HENEAGE sits at
extreme end of Front Opposition Bench. The Sage had prepared
some special playfulness for him. HENEAGE got wind of intention,
determined to spoil it by stopping away, and naif succeeded. But
the Sage had HABTINOTON and CHAMBEBLAIN well within range, and
with hands on hips, head persuasively bent over right shoulder,
and kindly eyes fixed full upon them, proceeded to reason with
them. House broke forth into laughter from time to time, and
CHAMBEKLAIN occasionally contributed a smile to the harmony of
Uie occasion. But HABTINOTON. with hands in pockets and hat
tilted over his brows, sat immobile. "He might as well sit at the
base of the Needle on the Embankment, and poke fun at the Sphinx,"
said САШЕ, observing the proceedings from a safe quarter behind
the SPEAKEB'S chair. MICHAEL HICKS-BEACH droned along for the
space of an hour, after which BBADLAUGH caught the SPEAKEB'S eye,
and the House promptly emptied. "Can't stand two Members from
Northampton in one night, said DONALD CUBBIE, making for the
door. HABTINOTON spoke later, with JOHN MOBLET to follow,
making up a good night's debate. "It's magnificent," said!.HENBT
JAMES; "out it isn't grouse."
Business done.—Resumed Debate on the Address.
Tuttday.—Outside, a hot, close August night. Inside, sort of
April weather. Long'courses of " placid sunshine, then the sky sud-
denly covered with clouds, and, out of the blue, bolts falling in all
directions. PABNELL began the sunshine, placid as the bosom of a
lake when all the winds are at tiesta. "Ours is the winning cause,"
he said, and, till the prize was reached, it behoved Irish representa-
tives to be moderate and patient, and to advise patience and modera-
tion at home. Швт-DrKE, the first precursor of storms, the earliest
bolt from the blue. Interposed hotly before PABNELL had proceeded
a quarter of an
hour. SPEAKER,
with great
promptitude,
took up the
seething bolt,
and, as it were,
dropped it in a
bucket of water.
After this, peace
and quietness
once more, till
PABNELL, al-
ways mild, de-
precative, sub-
missive, almost
angelic, conclu-
ded his speech.

ments of the spokesmen for the Government P The very papers on

Even RANDOLPH affrighted. Objection withdrawn, and he went on
his way rejoicing.

[SEPTEMBER 4, 1886.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
After this House emptied, and MAT HABBIS of Galway took the
floor. HABÉIS in highly discursive mood began by commenting on
what he called the " parrylettio" state of House. But House not so
helpless as he thought. Embarking upon a homily on religious
differences in Ireland, was called to order. Then he entered the
butter-market, and chatted for some ten minutes on prices current.
Thence he slid into the whiskey store, out of which he was peremp-
torily dragged by the SPEAKEB. Coming next to the question of
peasantproprietors, someone moved to have the House counted, after
which HABBIS sat down and GENT-DAVIS got up. Got up indeed,
several times, insisting upon orderly procedure.
"The House of Commons," said RANDOLPH, soltó voce, "consists
of 669 Gentlemen and one GENT-DAVIS."
A little later W. RUSSELL having made a pointed reference to his
conscience, Dr. TANNES observed quietly, with air of conviction,
"You never had one." Debate was then adjourned.
Business done.—More Debate on Address.
Thursday,—Something like old times to-night. Fifty-five ques-
tions on the paper, with more to follow. Dr. TANNER had five
in succession. "Thought he'd died of fasting," RANDOLPH
growls. Evidently hadn't, and appetite for information cruelly
unimpaired.
House crowded in all parts. CHAMBEBLAIÎÎ expected to renew
Debate on Address. In his place, and evidently ready. But Irish
Members determined to have a little fun. If they could run him
into dinner-hour, how mad he would be! So kept up conversation
on appointment of REDVEBS BULLEB, talking till Eight o'Clock.
"Now, Mr. CHAMBEBLTNG," said JOSEPH GILLIS, gleefully rubbing
his hands together, "now, you shall make your speech while
everybody but me goes to dinner." Counted without the jmest.
JOSEPH of Birmingham equal, after all, to JOSEPH GILLIS. When
the time came, he quietly went off to dinner himself! Came back at
Ten o'Clock in comfortable mood, and fired off his broadside before
crowded House. Funny to see DILLWYN rubbing his eyes, and fur-
tively pinching himself. "Thought I was asleep, and dreaming,
TOBY, he said. "But, since I'm awake, we must be in Topsy-
turvy land. Here's the Tories cheering CHAMBEBLAIN like mad,
whilst the Irish Members howl at him, and the Liberals shake their
heads."
CHAMBEBLAIN spoke amid constant interruptions. Effect upon
YEO most extraordinary. Hitherto known as quiet, retiring Member;
not yet dared his maiden speech. To-night constantly on feet,
wildly signalling to SPEAXEB, and shouting out, "I rise to order!"
It seemed an automatic process. Some one said " Heave !" and there
was YEO. "What do you think of CHAMBEBLAIN'S speech?" I
asked the Sage of Queen Anne's Gate. "It completes his ruin,
TOBT. He's burned his boats, and will never get back to the
Liberal Party." But then CHAMBEKLALN had been saying something
nasty about Elijah's mantle and the Sage.
Business done.—More Debate on Address.
Friday.—A long list of set speeches to-night. But principal busi-
ness been carried on by interjections. SEXTON resumed debate in
speech, spoiled, as usual, by its verbosity. A desert of words, with
here and there a green oasis of bright thought, and felicitous expres-
sion. BABTTELOT, who followed, thrice called to order by the
SPEAKIB, and once interrupted by JOSEPH GILLIS. JOSEPH'S hawk
eye, flashing round, fell upon front Opposition Bench, where CAINE
was chatting with CHAMBEBLAIN. This hurt JOSEPH GILLTS, who
is nothing if not orderly. CAIRE, not being Privy Councillor, or
Member of the late Government, no business on Front Bench.
JOSEPH solemnly called SPEAKIB'S attention to incident. Next
interruption came from GENT-DAVIS. WILFBID LAWSON on legs,
telling interesting story about farm-servant, who was always taking
extraordinary courses. One day he hung himself, and farmer said,
'• I wonder what the man will do next." GENT-DAVIS couldn't see
point of this, so rose to order, and WILFBID LAWSON courteously
explained—the story applied to CHAMBEBLAIN. HABCOUBT'S speech
brought half-a-dozen Members up on points of order, including
RANDOLPH. Immense uproar, and RANDOLPH finally sat down,
without having point of order settled. All the while CHAMBEBLAIN
sat smiling on Front Opposition Bench, whilst HABCOTTBT thundered
around him, and Tories, Radicals, and Parnellites fought for his
body. "If this is a sample of the life we're to lead under new
conditions of Party," said the SPEAKF.B, as he ate his modest chop,
"I '11—I '11—take another cup of tea."
Business done.—PARNELL'S Amendment to the Address rejected by
304 votes against 181.
IS HE ALSO AMONO THE SPIRITUALISTS? Sir FBEDERICX LEIGH-
TON, P.H.A., has painted his " Arta of Peace" for the South
Kensington Museum, in " Spirit Fresco." At any future séance,
Sir FBEDEBIOK will be happy to give all information respecting the
medium employed.
ROBERT'S LITTLE ADWENTUR.
I'VE had a
strange adwen-
tur here. Great
Marlow seems a
reglar Fairyland
for adwenturs,
and there's allers
a fairy or two
connected with
it, as in my case.
Well, I wor a
warking last
Mnnday mornin,
not by the sad
sea wave, sut-
tenly not, but by
our brite spark-
lin ripplin river,
injoying the
warm sunshine
and the bootiful
breeze, and the
lovely seenery
all round, wen
suddenly, with-
out the least bit
of warning, off
flew my wener-
able hat, right
into the foaming
billows. I niver
was so eston-
ished in all my
life, and niyer
felt so hutterîy
elpless. Con-
sidder my siti wa-
shun. I speaks of my hat as a wenerable hat, but not from its age,
but its karaeter. It was called by the respecterbel Atter from whom
I purohest it, the Harchdeecon, and he told me that aU Harchdeecons
was nommenally Wenerable from the werry fust, weather they bede
wenerable or not by hage, hence my hat 's name, and as it procured
me the nodding and bobbing respeo of the jewvenile poppylation of
this and other similar places, it was in coorse pryceless to me.
And to see it bobbing up and down quite elplessly ion the waves,
and yet with a sort of sly snigger at its puzzled Marster, was
allmost too much to bear.
How on airth was I to git home! Wot a trewly horful situation
for a Hed Waiter of pecooliarly sensetif nature, warking about the
Srinciple streets of Gentlemanly Marlow without no hat! The ideer
id cross my bewildered mind to plunge boldly into the foaming
torrent and grasp it, but no, that wood ha' been out of the fire into
the frying pan with a wengeance. I was on the werry brink of
despair, as well as of the river, wen I seed with both my delited eyes,
two of the most bootif ullest ladies in all bootiful Marlow, a dimming
towards me in a Bote, one a pulling and one a steering. "Youth in
the Bow, and Beauty at the Elm," as the Poet says. They had seen
my atless oondishun, and with all that Pity that is so necessary apart
of a butiful Fairy's natur, they had pulled to my rescue! and with a
grace, and a charm, and a sweet smile as I shall never forget, they
rescued my hat from its watery grave, and tossed it skilfully to its
greatfool owner!
I draws a whale over my boundless gratitood, and as my pore hat
was thoroly soacked to the skin, I perched it on the werry roof of my
hed, in a kind of degazy style, as the French calls it, and rapidly
sort my umbel home a wiser and a wetter man. ROBEBT.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE HORSE-PLAY AT DRURY LANE.
OF course Horses will "draw," but as Messrs. HARRIS and
РЕТТПт'в A Run of Luck is an ingeniously-constructed melodrama
of a certain popular type, and capitally played all round, it would
be a sufficiently exciting play, were the real live horses, including
the chief actor Daisy, eliminated from the performance. It might
be improved were some of
the dialogue curtailed in
the scenes between the
brothers Harry Copsky
(Mr. GRAHAMK), George
Selby, (Mr. E. W. GARDI-
NER), and their once "fast,"
but now decidedly slow and
very "Heavy Father"
(Mr. WILLIAM RIGNOLD).
Mr. CHARLES CART-
WRIGHT as the villanous
Captain Trevor, with a
strong sense of the humor-
ous, is excellent, and Mr.
HAEBT NICHOLLS as a
scoundrelly cad, is artisti-
cally comic. Persecuted
virtue is charmingly repre-
sented by M iss ALMA MUR-
RAT; and Lucy ByefiM,
a name implying that its
bearer has gone out of the
strictly straight path, is
powerfully represented by
handsome Miss SOPHIE

bournood of St,J-hn'e W_d, naturally take. tent oonfes8Íun is th^she

And the story ?—Well—Daisy is a trainer's daughter and betrothed
to Harry Cupsley. George Selhy, a fast young man, has conceived
a fierce passion for Daisy, and is in with a bad set, represented by
Messrs. CARTWRIOHT and NICHOLLS, who think they can arrange a
sort of Eliza-Armstrong sensation in a quiet way, which will effectu-
ally compromise George and Daisy. In this they fail because George
hasn't taken enough champagne to obfuscate his sense of honour,
and also because Miss ETRE, as Loosey Byefleld, once Captain
Trevor't victim, now his deadly enemy, becomes (ALMA) " MURRAY'S
Guide," and assiste her to escape. The mechanism of this scene, as
indeed of all the scenes throughout the piece, reflects the greatest
credit on Mr. HFNRY EMDEU'S and the authors' inventive resources.
Lootey and Daisy have scarcely got two steps from the house, when
they are stopped by wicked Mri. Willmnre, who so upsets Daisy
that she falls on the ground. The wicked Captain appears, who
would .make short work of Loosey, but for the arrival of George
Se%"and the timely fall of the Curtain.
In .the Third Act we are introduced to the exterior of Squire



Even hunting in summer-time must have an end, and so, clearly
much against his will, Squire Daniel Lambert Overtwentystone has
consented to this being "The Last Meet," which is attended by
HARRY NICHOLLS in pink,
but on foot, the Huntsman,
the Whips with a few strag-
gling hounds, a super or
two mounted, and also in
pink, as representing the
county gentry and members
of the hunt, and a small
boy in Eton collars and
jacket, who is evidently a
youthful enthusiast, as he
has come out with the first
saddle he could find, which
happens to be a military
one, with a peak before and
behind, rather than not
come out at all.
On the occasion when we
had the honour of being
present at "The Last Meet,
the Squire's Niece (Miss
COMPTOX) was in such a
hurry to he off and away,
that she allowed herself to
be pitched up anyhow into fint appearance of Miss Maypole Selby, the

alighted like a badly-packed «how, «ven at George Selby's Chamber«,.

either saved from falling over on the off-side by her presence of
mind and presence of pummel, or by her cousin George, or whoever
had helped her up, catching huid of her legs on the near-side, which,
however, was hidden from my view.
Squire Overtwentystone, however, representative of the County
Quantity rather than "the duality,"
modestly preferred going off the stage,
and after mounting well out of sight,
behind the leafiest screen the side-scenes
or "wings" could offer, reappeared on
a horse which was apparently so little
up to his weight that it n quired the
assistance of two grooms on fou t to sup-
port him in his saddle, and even then
the hearty old Gentleman gave such a
decided lurch to one side, when hie
horse turned the corner of a profile tree
rather sharply, as nearly brought him
off at a right angle, but for the assistance
of his faithful grooms.
After witnessing such a daring feat of
bnisrinaiblii]) on the part of the reckless
old Squire, we were not in the least
surprised to see him—having probably
in the interim dismissed his grooms on
reaching the turnpike road—brought
back, helpless, on a gate which he must
have been trying to open all alone, and
so tumbled off. Thinking that he is at
Mr. Harry Nicholle in pink his last gatp, he acknowledges Harry


Bquire Overtweiitj-itone. A Country Seat and Holdings.
Selby's country house on the morning of " The last Meet." The Pom-
pous fat Squire, whom we may call Squire Overtwentystone, is such
an undefeated and irrepressible Nimrod that he keeps up the sport
far into the month of June, or even later, if foliage be any criterion
of the time of year. Perhaps Squire Overtwentyetone, alia» DAM кт,
LAM BERT, Junior, may be of opinion that a good run with a July fox
will not only be the very thing to reduce hie fit, hut aleo marvellously
appropriate to the dog-days.

This is not so. Squire Overtwentystone may not even be the best
part, but it is most undoubtedly "the biggest part in the piece,"
and one in which, as the stage-slang has it, "there is the most fat."
The situations at the Railway Station—how the villains are put on
the wrong track, and how the horse gets in the wrong box—are most
ingeniously contrived. The real race is the best ever witnessed up
to now, on the stage, and that the Run of Luck ought to do
uncommonly well is the opinion of (what the Squire might like when
he goes into training) COCOA NIBBS.

"UNION;'." OR WHICH WAY.?

THF.BE were three Foxes, famed for pluck and cunning,
Who 'gainst an ancient Lion wished to band;
They were not ¡given to gregarious running;
Reynard prefers to "tight for his own hand."
One was a Fox of 'cuteness quite abnormal;
The second was more stolid, but ran btraight;
Although " on terms," their friendliness was formal,
And had been just a little (trained of late.
The third, a cub of curious shape, was younger,
But vastly "varmint," and exceeding swift.
The three were smitten with a common hunger
To give that aged Leo a short shrift.
"Union is strength," said they—a solid maxim !—
Leo, though rather old, has teeth and claws;
The Fox who singly worries or attacks him
May get a grip from his confounded jaws.
"Union is strength," and cunning combination
Often succeeds when scattered weakness fails.
And so, 'midst mutual congratulation,
They tied themselves together—by their tails!
Union is strength, but if you wish to tackle
A mighty common foeman, you must see
That Union is a tie, and not a ahackl«;
And this they quite forgot, our cunning three.
Three Foxes who desire to run together
Must find, before they very far advance,
The inconvenience of a caudal tether.
They tug, and then across their shonlders glance.
Which way f That is the Question. If each Reynard
Follows his nose, and neither one prevails.
The only fruits of tugging might and main hard
Will be that they 'II stand still, or lose their tails.
Whilst should one lead, no matter which, the others
Can hardly share the rapture of the rush;
For there 's small joy to banded vulpine brothers
In being so dragged backward by the brush.'
MORAL.
When people prate of the delights of Union,
Ask if it means bj[ fetter or by love;

French papers and sometimes an
amusing illustrated local journal called the Royat Bßou, in which
the "pictures of the place are really excellent. After this, first
breakfast and rest in room, listen to band, write letter, or part of
one feebly, and, at ll'SO, second breakfast, i.e. early lunch.
As everything is done methodically here, to ascertain the correct
time, and to set your watch by it, is a matter of the first import-
ance. But the Royat clocks, like the Rule of Three in the old
schoolboy rhyme, "they bother me." The timepieces, or the out-of-
time pieces, cannot agree upon a decided pobcy; they cannot be
unanimous—no, not for an
hour. The visitors are im-
plored by the Hotel pro-
prietors to be punctual in
their attendance at the
table-ifhute. A prayer to
this effect meets the eye on
every landing, on every
staircase, in every passage,
until the visitor gets it im-
pressed upon his brain; and
if he be of a truly sympa-
thetic nature, he will put
himself to any temporary
inconvenience rather than
that his unpunctualitv at
the table-d'hoie should in
the slightest degree distress
the humble and beseeching
proprietor. He will do so
once or twice, not more;
and only this during the Day Companion of

Hotels at fioyat, and a °°™P OI fS"i Al ,lne Bath and Well
a few more elsWhe«. JStabliesement the tone taken K t
is quite different. Here the
bather is peremptorily informed by printed cards which he cannot
possibly avoid seeing at every turn, and on the wall of every cabinet,
as well a* by his bath-attendant—I am in the care of the doyen of
them—that, it having once fixed his own time, he doesn't stick to it,



be runs the chance of not getting a bath at all; and if, being once
in, he doesn't come out to the very minute, the Administration will,
toput iteolloquially, knowthe reason why. Consequently, what strikes
you forcibly, at first sight, is the strict punctuality of Royat. So you
at once look about for the exact time. Where are you to get it? The
Church Clock? There is the parish church—a marvellous old cas-
tellated church—up a hill, a good, or, rather, a very bad quarter of
an hour's toil, on a Royat-ly hot day, and, when you reach it, well
worth seeing in itself, but no clock. Yon decide on setting your
watch by the clock at the Etablistemtnt. You do so, and on re-
turning to the hotel, you find that either your watch has gained a
quarter of an hour in less than five minutes, or that the Hotel
tune is not in accord with the Bathing-house time, and so you
make a calculation, and take the Hotel time.
At eleven, by Hotel time, you, as a novice, present yourself at the
table-d'hóte. It is the hour fixed by the Proprietor. The tables are
laid, but—pertonne t Not a soul! From behind different screens in
various parts of the very long room a few waiters appear, coming out
as if they were playing a game of hide-and-seek, or rehearsing an
entertainment. They give some finishing touches to the tables, and
whisk off a fly or two with their napkins, as is the custom with
waiters when they have an idle moment. The punctual visitor asks
one of them, if it is
not the hour of break-
fast. Perfectly. "Will
Monsieur be seated?
He can be served at
once. No, thank you;
Monsieur would ra-
ther not begin until
there are some few
to keep him company,
as it looks so greedy
in a table-d'hóie of
one hundred and
twenty to be the only
one feeding when the
other hundred and
nineteen guests ar-
rive. They will be
here soon. They come
in gradually, and by
11 '20 the room is full,
and the breakfast has
seriously commenced.
From this the novice
deduces that "ele-
ven" punctually
means a quarter to
half - past eleven.
But by which time P

The Clocklew Parish Church. "Time no object.1
The clock on the stairs, the clock in the
passage, the clock over the Post-office, or the clock at the Baths?
There are other clocks in the village of a perfectly free and indepen-
dent turn, and one on the basement of the Splendid Hotel of so
feeble a character that it has given up the struggle altogether, and
stopped dead with its two hands helplessly pointing to eleven, as if
it had been within five minutes of finishing the day, but hadn't
strength left to struggle up to twelve.
The force of all this bad example on my watch is that one morning
it suddenly stops, and for one quarter of an hour with mule-like
obstinacy refuses to go on. Now whether this course of conduct was
adopted by my watch out of a mistaken sense of politeness towards the
other clocks, in order to let them come up with it—it had been fifteen
minutes in advance of most of them—or whether it thought it ought
to start fair, or whether it was from sheer cnssedness, or the effect
upon its works of Royat temperature, has ever since remained a
mystery to me, which Time may or may not explain. Just as I was
on the point of taking it to a watch-maker's, its state of suspended
animation came to an end (which looks uncommonly as if it had been
attempting some deception, and was afraid of professional investi-
gation), and not only did it go on again as briskly as ever, but, as
if to make up for lost time, it shot ahead of them all, and kept the
lead by twenty minutes in front of the fastest of them, up to the
end of my stay at Royat.
True there are bells to summon you; but if yon attempt to check
the time by the bells you will be " quite at sea." There are all sorts
of breakfasts everywhere about, for all sorts and conditions of men.
And there are bells to each meal; the first to inquire "Are you
ready?" and then after waiting some twenty minutes for an answer,
the second bell says "Offl" The Band is advertised to рЦу
from 9'30 to 10'30. But personally I have never been able to fix it
to a particular time. I can say it will play about 9 '30 and leave off
about lO'SO, but this is the nearest approach to certainty at which I
can arrive. "When it does start, the Band, which is excellent, keeps
admirable time, though it never indulges its audience in any selec-
tion lasting more than two minutes, and the duration of its entr'acte*

is quite out of proportion to that of the morceaux it performs. The
exception is when they play as ufinale the Overture to William Tell,
or when a clever flageoletist—an artistic Whistler—gives us his
peculiar views of how the " Carnival de Venue " ought to be played
if he could always have his way. •
My conclusion is that a well regulated healthy appetite is the best
clock. I charitably allow for the dif-
ference of clocks, which are of all
shades of opinion, and my advice to
the visitor is, that he should daily
regulate his own watch by the Bath-
house clock. This is the only thing
necessary, the appetite will do
the rest.
Anyhow the day goes very
quickly here, and, as the
fiyely little gentleman who has
his shop next door, and acts
as our Universal Provider—there is
nothing he is not ready to get for you—
observes, "All times are good at
Royat," and he refuses to believe that
an Englishman, coming here from his
own hind of fog, can possibly have any
complaint to make. Does he not come
here to get rid of his complaints P—and
of his money too? The visitor is good
for Royat, and Royat 's good for him.
"Allons donc! what matters the dif- _ ^
ference of cloeks P You are hungry—
good !—you go to breakfast. Nothing Our " Lively Neighbou
more to purchase this morning f Hair cut to-morrow? Perfectly—

and goes te his own déjeuner, after which he will reappear in his
shirt-sleeves, enjoying a briar-root pipe.
_ Dr. REM has hinted that the most useful guide for his treatment
is a record of health kept by the patient himself. The " Treatment"
is going on. So I am noting all pains and penalties. I am watching
myself with a most vigilant eye. Not a twinge escapes me. If
there s a sudden shoot in my knee, I spot it at once, and down it
goes m my diary. If, on seating myself, there 's a pain in my left
shoulder, up I get again, out comes the diary, and time, place, and
duration of pain are accurately written down. If I am out walking,
and my foot hurts me, out comes note-book, and I put my foot in it.
If I am comfortably in bed, and feel a sort of cramp aU along my
left side, out I roll (not jump), seize diary, record the fact, and back
again to bed. By the end of four days—if I am only able to read
what I have written—my diary of sensations will be by that time
quite a sensational work.

THE LOST LETTER-BAG.

TLTV.
[Гни address of the following letter is, like the signature, unde-
cipherable. It looks something like Turgid Sea. The signature is
either V. E. G. or W. G. E. But that is no business of ours.]
MY DEAR ROSEBEBY,
YOTJB letter has only just reached me, owing to too literal
interpretation of instructions. When I said no letters were to be
forwarded to me, I meant the miscellaneous stream of inconsequential
epistles, daily addressed to me by political busybodies, old ladies, or
persons who want to get a few lines from me, which, accompanied by
a long epistle of their own, they subsequently send to the news-
papers. I didn't, of course, mean that a letter from you should have
been kept back. However, here it is, full of interest, and though it
is understood that during my holiday, I do not put pen to paper, I
send you these few lines hoping (as Номш somewhere says) that
they will find you well as they leave me at present.
This is a delightful country, in some respects very like dear old
Scotland. There are hills, and lakes, also highlands. But I have
not heard the pibroch sounding, nor have there been any manifesta-
tions on the part of the people to make me small presents. Still I
sometimes feel as if I had been born here, and have little doubt that
there is a strain of Bavarian blood in my constitution. Your home
news is most encouraging. I am glad to hear that my pamphlet made
tuch a profound impression, though I confess I do not find any traces
of this in the newspapers. Still it is the kind of seed that cannot
fail to bear fruit, and will tend to show that from the beginning I
have been unerringly right.
I 'm not at all surprised to hear about RANDOLPH. Put a beggar
on horseback, and through the ages his goal has been predestined.
They used to talk about my failings of temper. These were greatly
exaggerated for Party and personal purposes. Take them at their
worst report, what were they compared with this flouting of the
Legislature by a whipper-snapper, who but yesterday was the Bad
Boypf the House?
When I think of'the House of Commons, and hear these echoes of
its doings, I begin' to think my holiday is already sufficiently ex-
tended. I have been here ten days now, and already I am wearying
of having nothing to do, although, to tell the truth, I have since my
arrival occupied myself with a little trifle in the way of a revised
Home-Rule Bill for Ireland, which I shall introduce as soon as
RANDOLPH gets the Ministry thrown out. In the meantime I think
I shall go over to Ireland and look into matters for myself. Anyhow,
I cannot stand much more of this monotony, though I read the
prayers on a Sunday morning, and on Thursday night I am to take the
chair at some Penny Readings, where I mean to cast a historical
glance at the growth of the Nürnberg School of Painting, and give
my reasons for believing that HANS HOLBEIN really was born in
Bavaria. It is just possible—though at present I do not quite see
my way to do it in this connection—I may take this opportunity of
hinting at my own blood-relations with this estimable people.
Always yours faithfully, .

DEAR ALOY, Rockham, Yorkshire, Augutt 27.
You ask me how I like Rockham P Well, when a man hag
daughters, he must needs go where the mother of those daughters
choose. Rockham is very large and very lively, very sandy and
very brass-bandy. In the morning there is one great excitement—
I mean for us old boys—the newspapers come in. We each stt off
with a pocket-full, which we read as we lie on the fund. The chil-
dren play cricket round us on the beach, with old Ocean for long-
stop. Every one bathes, in all manner of funny costumes. The
pink tights embarrass a short-sighted man like me. I look for
fossils, occasionally. I found the eye of an Ichthyosaurus, for I
had noticed the place where the local tanner, and geologist, dropped
it. To tell you the truth, he "salts" the beach with specimens,
once a week. He finds it good for business.
It is a bore to be elderly in a place where you meet Beauty and
Fashion at every street-corner, but my daughters enjoy it, and, if
they are not fashionable, they are pretty enough. I find myself
looking like a dragon at harmless young men. I have not tried
fishing, I 'm " not very well in a boat," like the man in the poem.
Talking of poems, here is one of my own, on Rockham. It will tell
you more than I have energy to say in prose :—
ROMANCE OF ROCKHAM.
The Matrons of Rockham they sit on the beach,
And their modesty no one, I 'm sure, will impeach;
But the Public is bathing as bold as can be
Where the Matrons of Rockham go down to the sea!
And the children of Rockham they walk on the sands
With smiles on their faces and spades in their hands,
And I like to behold them a gambolling free
In the waves as they splash on the shores of the sea!
And the young men and maidens of Rockham delight
In music and dancing by day and by night;
And their shepherd, like Proteus, and ancient as he,
I seem as I stroll on the sands of the sea!
But I sit with the fogies in wickerwork huts,
Or I throw, for a penny, at cocoa-nuts,
And I own that I cannot hit once out of three,
As I shy at the nuts by the shores of the sea!
There, you note what " idleness and fulness of bread" can bring
a seasoned old lawyer to, in the way of poetry. It soothes the decline
of life. "We go no more a roaming" now—not further than to
Rockham, any way. Oh, the good days when we girded ourselves,
like St. Peter, and went wherever we would I 'Tis gone 1 'tis gone!
Ever yours, THOMAS QOTVEBFUL.
THE Author of What to do v>ith our Girls has sent us a pamphlet,
with Press notices of his work. Prominent among quotations is one
from The Bucles Herald. Just the topic for the Old Bucks to advise
upon. By the way, is the Author who wants to tell us " What to do
with our Girls," and who gives us his address as residing at a Dove-
cot Villa in the Green Lanes—how charming I—also the writer of
a recently popular song, "Oh, you Girls! you naughty Young
Qirlt!"? Perhaps; but in any case Mr. VANDEKBILT'S compilation
appears to be a most useful one.

and in another place he says, "He never, however, became an officiating priest,
although Pope Píos тнв NINTH advanced him to the rank of Canónico in the
ecclesiastical hierarchy." And he recounts how LISZT complained to him that in
Paris and London he was always spoken of and addressed as " Abbé."
Now, FBAKZ LISZT was no more a Priest, " officiating" or not officiating, than
Mr. BEATTT-KINGSTON himself. He received " minor orders," without which he
could not have been made a "Canonicus." And if he did not become " sub-
deacon," as it is probable he did not, though generally this step is necessary for
a canonry, then, as neither the tonsure nor the first four orders carry any obliga-
tion of celibacy, the musical Canon was as free to marry, had he been " so dis-
poged," as is any English bachelor. "Abbé" simply means " the Reverend
Mister," and is applied to any ecclesiastic. In England LISZT ought to have
been addressed as "Canon LISZT," just as we speak or " Canon LIDDON."
Mr. RICHARD LEE in this Number concludes his biographical sketch of SAMTTEL
PHELPS, which is a more satisfactory performance than a work we recently came
across written by a Mr. COLEMAN, in which the proportion of PHELPS to COLE-
MAN was as the halfpennyworth of bread to the intolerable amount of sack.
There are some Operatic Reminiscences, by M. HERVÉ, who—
"In epite of all temptation
To belong to his own nation,
Has become an Englishman,"
and signs himself "CHARLES HKRVEY." He has lately written to the effect
that "his fighting days are over"—which must be a consolation to France.

CROMER CLOVER!
YOU may trip and travel the whole world over.
From Finisterre's Cape to the Downs at Dover,
Be you Benedick bold or a bachelor rover,
You will find no bed like the Cromer Clover!
I 've visited Portugal, on to Spain,
Been over the sea and back again;
To Lisbon carried without anv flurry
By the Drummond Castle of DONALD CURRIE.
Beneath the balcony Tagus rolled,
Past Belim's cloisters bathed in gold,
But the cactus roads were at last forsook
For the Cintra Palace of English COOK:
And then in the cool and the welcome shade
A dozing, dreaming vow was made,
That the Cintra Paradise fair might be,
But still there was home and the Cromer sea I
Away to the Palace, the park of Cid.
To the burning desert where reigns Madrid,
To the endless nights and sun-struck days,
To ices, pictures, flirtings, plays,
To the lonely city where pleasure is full
When a brute has bullied a harmless bull;
Where the man, and woman, and child of course,
Delight in the scream of a tortured horse!
But the Bull-fight yells and the Prado hum
Were hush'd when a whispering voice said, "Come
To the land of poppies, the home of corn,
To the cliffs of fern, where from night to morn
There is nothing but rest and a welcome peace,
When the weary voices of children cease,
And the stars shine out as the sun dies down,
To light a path to the Cromer town."
Secure on the cliffs, in the clover tossing.,
In dreams I follow the Biscay crossing:
With body on land and eyes at sea,
I laugh, and think of the misery
Of fogs in Channel, and watch out-looking,
Of oil and garlic, and Spanish cooking,
Of endless travel by rail through sand,
Of the indolent pride of an idle land!
But oh! the joy to be home once more
In the flowering fringe of a welcome shore,
To hear, as the oreezes sweep my way,
The reaper's song and the child at play,
To watch the swallow, and mark the rhyme
Of the bee when buried in scented thyme,
To feel a presence, and hand in reach
High over the shout of the holiday beach,
To give up the part of a reckless rover,
And revel once more in the Cromer Clover!
FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.

THE marriage of the Hon. CHISELM HAHDUP with
GEOROINA, fifth daughter of the Earl of CATCHPENNY,
was solemnised yesterday at the Parish Church of St.
Mike's-in-the-Fields. Tne company were subsequently
entertained at a stand-up breakfast at the tea-counter at
the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, when the happy pair,
having previously pledged the bulk of their wedding pre-
sents at a local pawnbrokers, started for Wimbledon,
where they contemplate spending a short honeymoon, by
one of the afternoon Putney Omnibuses.
The Duke of BASDÍGHALL, having let the family seat
at Schedule Towers, the Duchess and her family have
removed from George Street, Paddington, to 113, Parade
Place, Herne Bay, where they purpose passing a brief
three weeks' season, previous to their return to the
suburbs to search for fresh apartments.
The Earl of FORFEIT is entertaining a distinguished
company, including two Sheriff's officers and a man in
possession at his seat on the Scotch Moors. His Lordship
made a fine bag of grouse on Monday's shooting, but it
was eventually seized and carried off under a bill of sale.
It is not true that Lord 1 ÍACKI >ur has entirely given up
his yachting enterprise since the seizure of his own
vessel, The Official Assignee, for arrears. He has entered
into an arrangement by which he and his family can
journey continuously out and home for a month from
London Bridge to Boulogne, in the fore-cabin part of the
steampacket* of the General Steam Navigation Company.

This test would try
My strength, had I the nine lives of a cat.
Why is it, why?
A hundred years are just a hundred years
Through which to grope.
Their passage leaves a man with fewer fears,
And little hope.
Why trot me out? Why tire me, at my age.

True, peaceful laurels may become the sage,
But these strange leeches
Would batten on my fame. Babblers, why make

Ready to bring down the casual grouse,
Now I can't even get off to the partridges,
Since I 'm condemned to this wearisome House.
Foolish debaters will spout on unceasingly,
Little they reck though the SPEAKER may frown;
Bores at St. Stephen's it seems are unceasingly
Stupid; and so I 've an Autumn in Town.
Pity me, ye who by moor or by mountain-side,
Shoot at your will where the heather waves free;

Listening to speeches no snoring can drown;
No one 's so wretched in all the whole city full,

A POSER FOR THE PETITIONERS.
IT is announced that the Beaumont Trustees are to be petitioned to
veto the sale of "intoxicating liquors," in the proposed People's
Palaoe of Delight at the East End. Why? Lest its visitors should
get intoxicated? How many do so, or would be allowed to do so, or
show any strong desire to do so, at similar places? The evil of
"intoxicating liquors" presumably, is that they intoxicate. But
taken in the moderate quantities likely to be desired or permitted at
the People's Palaoe of Delight, they do not intoxicate. There must
therefore be some other motive for the desire to taboo them. Can it
be the not unprecedented, or indeed uncommon, one of intolerant
fanaticism, hungering fiercely for the power to prevent other people
from taking their pleasure in any way not pleasurable to, or approved
of by the intolerant fanatic? And it во, should the Beaumont Trus-
tees or any other reasonable persons, pay any attention to such
bumptious bigotry, even when enshrined in the time-honoured, but
often deceptive, shape of Petition? Mr. Punch pauses for a reply.
If there is more to be said for the petitioners than meets his eagle
eye he would like to know it. At present he can see no particular
reason why the People's Palaoe of Delight should be compulsorily
Teetotal.
A WHISPER FBOH WKSTOATR.—Sir, I have been staying in the

Sir, that when you are walking, riding, or
driving about the Island, it is with difficulty
you can find vour way back again to Westgate-
on-Sea, as there is not a single sign-post on
which its name appears. There are arms point-
ing to Margate, to Eamsgate, St. Lawrence,
St. Peter's, Canterbury, Manstone, Acot, Can-
terbury, Birchington, and even to an obscure
village called Gorlinge,1,which, as I discovered,
is close to Westgate, but not one direction
to Westgate-on-Sea. Is it because of English
Rule that Thanet is thus arbitrarily treated?
If so Home Rule for Thanet, say I, and let
Westgate-on-Sea have a sign-post. Is there,
I ask feelingly, any reason why Westgate-on-Sea should not have
a sign-post? Its existence is no secret, and it is otherwise well
advertised. Also it has no pier. Shall I describe it as a "pier-less
place"? Yours, Mix'в

A CABINET COUNCIL.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
XXTRACTBD ГНОМ
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Нош« of Commons, Monday Night, August 30.—RANDOLPH'S
getting along very nicely as Leader of the House. Early in last
week he attempted to ¡fag Leader of the Opposition. Later, when
important question raised by gentlemen opposite, he blandly
observed that Government would take no part in discussion. That
was so late aa Friday. To-day, coming back like giant refreshed,
he publicly and angrily accuses gentlemen opposite of obstruction,
because they ventured for some five hours through sultry night to
discuss annexation of Burmah. It happened just at midnight when
Amendments to the Address had been disposed of. Dr. CLAKK next
in order with Motion relating to Scotch Crofters. RANDOLPH
righteously indignant. Move the Adjournment at Twelve o'Clock!
Was ever such a thing done or thought of except by wilful obstrue^
tionists V Perhaps not otherwise; but, as АвтИив О'Сонков un-
kindly remarked, "When it was my lot to act in co-operation with
the noble Lord, and the Treasury Bench was occupied by the Liberal
Party, such things often happened."
A sudden clamour filled the House. Reached its climax when
CONYBEABE rose to swell the flood of condemnation. But House had
had enough for one night, and now momentarily withdrawing regard
from RANDOLPH, concentrated its anger on CONYBEABE, who, after
ft straggle, sat down. Then reproach and rebuke turned again in
full force upon this amazinp CHANCELLOR of the ЕХСПЕОЛГЕВ. All
his old friends and companions dear turned upon him with uncon-
trolled anger. He to wax indignant about obstruction! TAT PAT,
Автнув O'CoNNOB, MOLLOY, and Windbag SEXTON vied with each
other in warmth of indignation. JOSEPH GILLIS became alternately
retrospective and admonitory. His noble friend Lord BEACONSFIELD
"had a theory" that when there was minority of sixty in favour of
Adjournment, no use Government attempting to resist.
If," added JOEY B. in solemn tone, "the noble Lord is to be
Leader of this House, he will require to keep on decent terms with
as many Members as possible."
Delightful to watch RANDOLPH bullied by TAT PAY, betrayed by
Annum O'CoNNOB, and almost wept over by JOSEPH OILLIS. Нкжв-
BEACH tried to repress a smile of content, CHAPLIN didn't.
"RANDOLPH," he whispered across Gangway, "you 're finding out
that the House of Commons isn't STAFFOBD NOBTHCOTE, to be ridden
rough-shod over, nor HICKS-BEACH to be ordered hither and thither.
You '11 have to give in, my boy."
And so it was. An hour having been wasted, RANDOLPH explained
that he didn't mean anything by the words complained of, withdrew
opposition to Adjournment, and so home to bed. But much of this
kind of thing won't do.
liuxitii-ss done.—Debate on Burmah.
Tuesday.—SPEAKEB happily in good training in spite of sultry
weather. Had regular engagement with Irish Members to-night,
hitting out right and left for several consecutive hours, always neatly
lowering his man. Began near the beginning with McLABEtr, who
seconded new amendment to Address dealing with Crofters' question.
Close of first half-hour warned MoLA£EN his remarks were not
relevant. Twice he pulled up Dr. CLARK, and once sharply brought
Tip BAUMANW, who was engaged in interesting incidental controversy
with Dr. CLABK. CLABE in speech at Glasgow had mildly alluded to

[SEPTEMBER 11, 1886.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

The MACULLÜM MOKE as "well known to have been a great thief and
robber," a description which, when quoted by li u-.м \N.V, Irish Mem-
bers loudly cheered. ( 'ьл к к dissented from accuracy of report.
"Then does he mean," said BAUMANN, "to convey that the Duke
of ARGTLL is a robber and a thief?"
What Dr. CLABK did mean to convey was that the DUKE was a
legal robber. This, BAUMANN said, was
"a vulgar and venomous scurrility.
CLABK shocked at such language. Appealed
to SPEAKER. BAUMANN argued that "ve-
nomous scurrility," was no worse than thief
and robber. SPEAKER ruled that ВAUMANN
must withdraw, which he did,
and business proceeded. MASON
who followed, pulled np by
SPEAKER. Dr. TANNER, after
warning, peremptorily ordered
to sit down. MAT HARRIS, after
two warnings, also ordered to
resume his seat. BLAINE strolled
in just in time to allude to the
Crofters as "men whose fore-
fathers and deecendante had car-
ried our bayonets victoriously all
over the world." SPEAKER
again interposed, and BLAINE
retreated. FLYNN came
next, and after two warn-
ings was floored. CONWAY
was cautioned but escnped
by a neck, whilst O'UAN-
LON, in the middle of a
magnificent sentence de-
scribing "the poor Scotch
Crofters driven from the
Lowlands into the moun-
tain oaves of the High-
A- Bt** lands." was ordered to sit
down. SPEAKER coming up smiling for the fifteenth round, the
other side threw up the sponge. No one attempted to follow O'HAN-
LON. House divided ana Burmah Amendment rejected by 203 votes
against 121. Business done.—More talk on the Address.
Wednesday.—RANDOLPH pissed rather a warm afternoon. 90" in
shade outside, 180* in the neighbourhood of Treasury Bennh. But
the wind is tempered to the shorn lamb. RANDOLPH not altogether
out of luck. Matter under discussion the Belfast riots, and RAN-
DOLPH'S heroic incitement to the Orangemen. Fortunately for
culprit, Windbag SEXTON had undertaken to urge indictment.
Sharp speech of twenty minutes or half an hour would have riddled
RANDOLPH. Windbag took two hours to empty. Wearied-ont
Members who really wanted to get at bottom of business. Scores
cleared out. Those that remained to the end grew savage under
SEXTON'S mechanically withering smile, his aggravating pauses, and
his general content with himself.
Some interest aroused by appearance of JOHN DILLON with famous
boi of arguments collected in recent controversy in Belfast. A little
rusty with being dipped into bucket of water when MILMAN found
them on the Bench below Gangway. Curious to see Members oppo-
site clear out when JOHN took in hand a likely bolt or half-pound
iron nut. But he didn't shy any of them, contending himself with Par-
liamentary language. Business done.—Fresh departure on Address.
Thumday.—Thought I knew those Blücher boots. It was the
Right Hon. Viscount Grand CROSS. Nearly got between his legs and
threw him down.
"How do, TOBT?" he said, handing me two fingers,—" without
prejudice, of course."
"What do you mean, without prejudice?" I said, looking for his
other three digits, which he always wore in the House of Commons.
"Why, the fact is," said his Lordship, "must draw the line some-
where. Don't mind speaking to you, but it can't be expected that
every fellow who happened to sit with me in the House of Commons
must take advantage of accidental circumstances, and presume on my
acquaintance now I 'm in another sphere; my own sphere, I may sav.
"Yes, my Lord," I said, willing to humour him, "I think youVe
reached your level now. You were occasionally something above the
comprehension of the House of Commons."
"(luitи right, TOBY." said the Viscount, staring stonily through
his spectacles at LAWRENCE of Liverpool, who passed with sign of
recognition. "You can alwavs speak to me when we meet."
In the House of Commons, dull to begin with, but decidedly lively
finish. The SPEAKER again at bay. Made young REDMOND tremble
in hie shoes. Even drew from him an apology, being the first ever
spoken by Irish Members since Parnellism began. Had a turn with
HABCOT/RT. Whilst House was cleared for division Captain COLOÍTB
and Doctor TANKEÄ had private set-to of their own. The Captain
said the Doctor was "paid for this bind of work." The Doctor
tersely replied, "You're a liar!" Not as original as You're an
Emporium, but served. As lor RANDOLPH he would not say any-
thing, though charged with inciting to civil war in Belfast. Irish
Members insisted upon his having opportunity to defend himself.
So refused to agree forthwith to Report of Address.
Business done.—Address agreed to.
Friday.—RANDOLPH appeared to-night clothed, and in his right
mind. Evidently been thinking over what CBAPLDÎ said to him on
Monday night. Finds it true that House of Commons not, like
STAFFORD NORTHCOTE, to be bullied into submission, so puts on defer-
ential air, protests his profound respect and regard for everyone.
Suggests that if it was quite agreeable to all parties, the Govern-
ment would be obliged if all the time of the House were given up to
Supply, and if any gentleman opposite would like to kick Sir
MICHAEL HICKS-BEACH, or pull the hair of the Home Secretary, they
might do it.
House always ready to meet Leader half-way when in this mood.
Fell into RANDOLPH'S arms, and wept. PARNELL took opportunity of
asking for opening for introduction of Irish Land Bill. "Is that
all?" said RANDOLPH. "Only another ЫЛ Land Bill? By all
means." So it was settled. Later, when Colonel SAÜKDERSON at-
tempted to re-establish the former order of things, brought charges
of sedition against Parnellites, offered to fight them in House or out,
RANDOLPH threw over his trusty free lance. Would have nothing to
do with him. Fell again into the arms of the House. After little
more blubbering, report of Address agreed to, and way made for the
business of Supply. Business Done.—Address got out of the way.

THE LAST NEW FRENCH REWOLUTION!
THEEE 's jest one good practise as I allers fpllers wen l'm a having
of my summer olliday. And that good practise is, never to read no
noosepapers, and why? Simply beooz I don't want 'em. I wants to
be quiet and at rest, and not to have nothink to wurry or egsite me.
To have plenty to eat, and plenty to drink, and plenty of rest, and
nothink to do, thems my ideers of an olliday, and not sitch werry bad
ones neather, as a GTJT.L or a GENITER will tell yer if you arsks him.
So till I came ome I was hutterly hignorant of wot had been going
on in Parris. Ah, we 've most on us heard of a great French
Rewolution ever so long ago, but I don't suppose as that was nothink
like wot took place last month in Parris, when all the Waiters, or as
they calls 'em there, Gassons, bust out into hopen rebellion in the
broad daylight, and marched, with their blood red Banners a flying,
rite up to the Otel de Veal, so sillybrated for its Cutlets, and
demanded their rites! Wot a hawful ewent for Parris, of all Cittys
in the world, the Pairodiee of Cooks and Cookery, and consequently
of Waiters. There 's no telling what might ha' happened, but the
Waiters like true Gentlemen as they are, not wishing to drive the
peeple to their extremitys, by their absense at dinner, left off
rebelling about fore a Clock in the arternoon, and went ome to their
own dinners afore commencing their heavy heavening dooties for the
dinners of others.
I carat quite understand wot it was all about, praps becoz it was
all done in the French langwidge, with which I am not werry
the old game
le my wages,
BBOWN'S strict
werassity. It gives one sum elite idear of the bloodthirsty conduct
of the French Perleeoe when one reads that in Joseph Street—which
BHOWN tells me leads to Pottifar Street,—they acshally arested two
waiters and a butcher boy, and seized a Flag! Did those sewere
measures stop the rewolution? No, enttenly not, for the brave héros
marched on to Cleary Square, where they were again attacked by the
mercyless Perleece, and seweral ground-floor winders broken!
Nothink derated, the gallant fellers rallied on Pont Nenf Bridge,
тоъ. xci.
but the fo barred ttíe way and dispersed them, but not before they
had, in their wrath, torn down a sineboard! At 5 a clock, adds the
sympathising reporter, they were all tired out, and dispersed, of
their own accord, to get sumthink to eat. And so ended the fust
Hact of this fearful rewolution, to be re-commenced when least
expected.
These terrible ewents in a naybouring Country, has naterally called
atention to the onerabel class to witch I has the onner to belong to,
wiz., the London Waiters, and I lerns with perfound astonishment
and sorrowful regret that there is no less than sewenteen thowsand
forren Waiters in this our own. native Country, a trying to supplant
us in the good opinion of our employays, as the French calls 'em, and
wot is we reckomended to do so as to hold our hone in this f ritef ool
and unnateral compeertition. I ardly expex to be bleeved, but its
littorally trew, wen I says as we are told to set to work and lern
Frensh, and Jerman, and Etallian! What a pitty they didn't add
Chinéese and Injian while they was about it. There never was
greater rubbish torked or ritten. What does a reel Gentleman care
about his Waiter torking four langwidges if he carnt anser questions
propperly and give adwice wen asked for it. Take a Jerman Waiter,
wot does he know about Port Wine, and the difference between noble
47's, and dellycate 51's, and a Frenchman ain't no better. Wot with
their washy Ock and their thin sour Claret, their poor pallets is quite
destroyed afore they cums over here to push us off our stools, as
Macbeth says in the play. And then how they fidgets and shuffles
about behind the gentlemen's cheers, witch is a noosance as no reel
gentleman can stand while he 's a setting at his dinner.
Besides, tho' in course I ain't no judge of their forren tungs, I do
see the dmerculty they has to understand wots sed to them in Inglish
and the ewen grater difficulty as they has in replying in Inglisn, so
as to be understood, speshally by the fare sects. So I for one ain't
got no sort of fear of being cut ont by a meer Forrener, ewen if he
coud speak a duzzen of tungs. There 's a sort of respeoful dignerty,

(Reflections by a Confuted British Associate.)
DID he, I wonder, in those remote ages,
Over two thousand long centuries gone,
Hear the sweet voices of Brummagem sages
Raised to expostulate, argue, and warn?
Did he, attending some Association,
British or other, with listening ear
Follow the maze of each tangled oration,—
Follow, yet manage to keep his head clear?
Did he take in every fact Biological,
Social, mechanical, brought to his view?
Did the researches styled Anthropological
All the tired f pringa of his spirit renew?
Did he go raving from Section to Section,
Feeling unequal each problem to sift ;—
Or, hoping to tind there some time for reflection,
Possibly seek his original drift!
Or, science unknown, did he wander, light-hearted,
Happy his flint-bound horizon to scan?
If so, then some joys of this world have departed,
There is not a doubt, with Preglacial Man!

LATEST OPERATION ON THE RUSSIAN BOÜBSE.—Bearing
Bulgarians for the Fall.
HOW TO ENJOY A HOME-MADE TRIP ABROAD.
Preliminary.—The House still sitting, and, consequently, a very
large number of persons who usually leave London for abroad at this
time of the year being detained in Town, it is proposed to show how
the customary Continental Excursion may be attained practically
without quitting the Metropolis. The home-made tripper should
assist the operation by exercising to the utmost his powers of " make-
believe." Imagination can do wonders, and in this matter it is
expected to effect a great deal.
From London to Folkestone.—The start should, of course, be made
at night. Leave Charing Cross by the South Eastern, and get to
Cannon Street, change there, and return to the Battersea Park
Station. Allowing for the usual delays, this will consume about the
same time as that generally expended in travelling from London to
Folkestone.
Crossing the Channel.—Take the Thames steamboat, and go into
the stuffy little cabin. Fall asleep, and remain concealed until the
boat has to be laid up for the night. You will probably be turned
ont somewhere near Charing Cross, when you can remain in the
waiting-room until the workmen's train on the Underground.
Arrival in Paris.—Go round the Inner Circle half-a-dozen times,
which will have the effect of the journey from Boulogne to the
Capital. Ultimately, alight at Charing Cross, and drive to some
third-rate French hotel in the neighbourhood of Leicester Square,
where the waiters speak English imperfectly. As you proceed on
your travels, change your hotel as occasion may require to suit the
nationality of the country you suppose yourself to be visiting. The
neighbourhood is rich in hostebnes—Swiss, German, and Italian; so
yon will have no difficulty in finding the required resting-place.
Food in Paris. — Breakfast (tea and bread-and-butter) in your
room. Second déjeuner (à la fourchette) at the Café Royal or
GATTI'S. Dinner at PRIVATELLI'S. Your meals are the most im-
portant matters of your existence abroad, and by selecting the estab-
lishments suggested, you will obtain a sufficientlyCon tinenta! flavour.
If you are not accubtomed to the Holborn, the First Avenue, or the
Grand, you will get excellent foreign fare therein; but should you
be an habitue of those magnificent institutions, of course the illusion
will be destroyed.
Life in Paris.—Do the place thoroughly, and freshen up your
recollection of, say, a quarter of a century ago. Of course you should
see Notre Dame (Westminster Abbey), the Madelaine (the Brompton
Oratory), and the Tombeau (St. Paul s). Then the Louvre, and the
Luxembourg (British Museum and National Gallery), should be in-
spected, and, if you have time, you might run down to Versailles
(Hampton Court). In the evening by all means attend the Café
Chantant at (the Albert Palace) Champs Elysees, after a drive
through (the Battersea Park) Bois de Boulogne. If you want to buy
anything for your womankind, you can visit the Grand Magasin de
Army and Navy Stores in Victoria Street, and the Brixton Bon
Marché on the other side of the river.
Switzerland.—Spend your time on the Serpentine, and the orna-
mental water in St. James's Park. This will not give you a bad idea
of the lakes, and if you want a little dangerous alpine climbing, try
to get up Primrose Hill in the dark, when the surrounding roads
are " up."
Venice.—Get a punt and float about the Regent's Park Canal. If
you can contrive to carry a wasp's nest in the boat, you will get
stings enough to forcibly suggest the assaults of the mosquito. The
peculiar odour of Venice will Ъе found in abundance on the water,
especially in the neighbourhood of the Zoological Gardens.
Rome.—You can see most of the treasures of the Vatican by
visiting the South Kensington Museum, which by the way may be
used for reproducing the Art collections at Florence, Dresden and
Munich. St. Paul's must again be requisi turned,|but this time to appear
for St. Peter's. Care, however, must be taken that only the exterior
of the Cathedral is seen, or the illusion will be completely destroyed.
The Catacombs may be fairly idealised during a visit to the subway
at South Kensington, and the dark arches of the Adelphi. _ Modern
improvement« may be realised by a visit to the London Tavilion (not
unlike the King's Palace at the Quirinal) and the Griffin—capital
specimen of modern Italian workmanship.

best to draw out of your bank the balance of the usual Hum you

this, burn the precious documents. This may require some power of
will, and considerable self-sacrifice, but unless you follow the course
recommended, you will never get the full effect of a trip abroad. To
be perfectly realistic you should be in a position to say that you have

A WATER COURSE.
VI.
The Bad Patient's Diary—Jane's Progress—Oyster$—Theory-
Fact—At Doctor's—The Strange Case—Hohes— Consultation
—Novelty—Sensations—Result—Puzzled.
WHEN yon once get into the swim, so to speak, in a water conree
such as this, then, whether it be at Eoyat, or Aix-lee-Bains, or Vichy,
or Homburg-, or even at La Bourboule and Le Mont Doré, the stream
is very strong, and you are carried on rapidly to the end of your
stay. The first week is exciting, if the place is itself a novelty; if
not, it is only less exciting; we walk tip into the pine woods,—
"'
.'( -:


"Whene'er we take our walke abroad."
"when," as Dr. PÜTTENEY eays, "we pine for air"—(this is the
effect of the place on him), and we take the week to settle down.
The second week is generally dull, yet at the end of it the time seems
to have flown. Third week begins slowly; but as the climax of the
twenty-first day approaches, when the course will be over, then the
time and money go with startling rapidity.
By my Diary of Pains and Penalties I find I am at the end of the
first week. What is the result? Well? No, decidedly not well;
that is, according to my Diary, which records a variety of alarming
symptoms—sleepless nights, sleepy days, troubles in toes—where the
snooting season has commenced before the Twelfth—pains in the
nose, limp legs, wrestlings with sciatica, and what the meteorological
reports term " Disturbances " generally, resulting in " Depression."
An annoying circumstance is, that dousin JANE, who has not been
strictly ordered here, as I was, but only "recommended" to the
waters, is becoming better and better every day. I cannot help
remarking it. The improvement in her health is so marked that ft
forces itself on general observation. She takes a bath of Cesar water
every day, into which she goes like cold lamb, and out of which she
comes like boiled lobster, and is all the better for it. She'is able to
walk about briskly; she doesn't hesitate as to taking a liqueur with

Peu de Cheveux aux Petite Chevaux.
her cup of coffee after dinner; she insists on venturing at least four
francs on the petits chevaux, and in her manner there suddenly
appears something of the effervescent and sparkling character which
is, she informs me, the peculiarity of the Source César. The
Romans discovered these baths, and this particular spring may
have been the source of CESAB'S greatness. The question—
"Upon what meat does this our СжвАВ feed,
That he is grown во great?"
is, as it is termed in theatrical slang, "a little bit of fat" that
would never have been put into the mouth of Cassius, "lean and
hungry" as he was, had SHAXSPEARE only known of the waters at
Royat, which _C^SAB used to drink, and in which he used to bathe;
ana out of which, after a few dozen oysters,—for they find heaps of
oyster-shells here among the Roman remains,—he used to come out
re-invigorated.
By the way, although I am considering Cousin JAKE'S case, and
have so got back to CJESAB, to whom historically she owes her rapid
improvement in health, I cannot help diverging on the subject of
Oysters, to note down, for some future work of my own on Chris-
tianity in Britain, the theorv, which is strongly supported by facts,
that Britons, who never would be slaves (except when they couldn't
help it), owed their conversion entirely to Oysters. I am not going
to discuss this further or to commence the first chapter of my history
now, but before the thoughtful reader I place facts and theory: —
1st. It is undeniable that the Romans loved oysters: 2nd. That
directly they heard of oyster-beds they went to them: 3rd. They
found the beds ready-made for them, and originated the old riddle
(which occurs in the works of JOSEPHCS MILLERIUB) about taking
the oysters out of their beds and tuekinc in themselves: 4thly. The
Romans became Christians without ceasing to be oyster-eaters,—in
fact it is probable that they practised oysterities,—and consequently
the British oyster-openers, and oyster-bed-makers, were the first to
encounter the Christianised Romans, who lost no time in converting
the natives, and thus the British became Christians by the dozen.
From the oysters, à nos moutons; second course. To resume.
Naturally
JANE'S progress
is annoying to
me, but politely
and cousinly, I
am delighted. I
compliment "her,
she is looking so
well. But I can-
not compliment
myself. Do I
look well? JANE
says I do. But
I don't believe it,
and I'm sure I
don't. A high
solour _ isn't
health: it may
be "the picture
of health," but
health isn't a
question of the
picture, but of
the frame.
Whatever was
the matter with
me before coming to Royat, I am quite sure as to there being plenty
the matter with me, and to spare, now, after just a week of the
treatment.
My Sensational Diary is assuming formidable proportions. If I
neglect it for half a day, the next morning I set myself to work to
remember all the sufferings of yesterday afternoon. If you do not
¡ot down pains at the moment, as they occur, when you can really
feel what you are describing—the secret of all truly graphic writing
—you are apt to describe the twinges, the smarts, and the aches
»Idly, as if you were writing the history of somebody else. You are
likely to take a very different view of a pain you suffered several
tiours ago, from what you will take of the pain which afflicts yon at
the time of writing, and which itself is the immediate cause of your
putting pen to paper. In a retrospect of pain you are inclined to
philosophise and probably attempt to trace its cause. In a description
of a pain, making its presence felt as you write, you do not stop to
pick and choose your words, but your style is snort, sharp, jerky,
powerfully graphic, and minutely accurate.
I determine not to disturb Dr. HAMMOND РГЛТЮГЕТ, who, not
taking the waters in any form, eating and drinking everything, and
smoking all day, is in the enjoyment of most perfect health, and
ipparently of a thorough holiday, but to go quietly to Dr. KF.M , show
liin my Diary, and astonish him.
I call upon him. He is within. I wait: at last I usher myself
into his sanctum. Will I be seated? I will. So will he, at his desk,
and once more he pulls out his note-book and refers to my particular

case. Before he can ask any questions. I produce, with quite a pro-
fessional air, my analytical summary of my own state of health. I
am тегу glad I nave noted it all down so carefully, because, as this is
a peculiarly fine morning and I am feeling uncommonly well, my
view of the past few days, had I left my pains to verbal description
from memory only, would have been necessarily coloured by my
healthy, happy, and perfectly satisfactory state at the present
moment, and Dr. КЕМ might, under a false impression, write down
"cured in five days' treatment," or order me to go on as 1 had begun,
a treatment that might be exactly contrary to what I ought to do.
As it_ is there is my plain written statement which I can neither
explain away or contradict. Litera scripta manet, and this diary is
produced by myself as evidence against myself. It is a precis of my
pains and penalties, and, considering that after all it ia the work of
an amateur, I really am quite proud of it as a scientific treatise
written by myself. Dr. One-Half, as an impartial observer, on myself,
Mieter Other-Half, or patient, merely taken as a body.
Everyone has read the Strange Case of Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll.
(By the way it may be Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but that 's of no
consequence, and I haven't the book by me.) Well, here is the
story very simply exemplified in Me. I am compounded of two
halves: Dr. Hyde one half, the scientific medical man; Mr. Jekyll,
other half, the patient. As Dr. Hyde I call on Dr. HEM, to inform
him how poor Mr. Jekyll has been getting on with his treatment.
Mr. Jekyll the patient sits in the chair: Dr. Hyde is represented
by the diary containing the scientific analysis of the "strange case,"
which Dr. REM has now under his eyes.
Dr. REM is reading Dr. Hyde'*, i.e., my, scientific analysis, most
attentively. I, Mr. Jekyll the patient, am watchinc him anxiously.
I expect him to raise his eyeorows at certain points, and exhibit
surprise. I expect him to purse up his lips, and mutter to himself
"Dear me !" or " Bless my soul, is it possible!" I expect him to rise
in an agitated manner from his desk, go to his book-case, and bring
out big volumes, over which he will pore, from time to time comparing
what he is reading with my strange narrative of the past week. I
expect him after this to sit down and rest his aching head on his
hand thoughtfully, as if this extraordinary case had fairly perplexed
him, had upset aÛ his principles, all his practice, and had compelled
him to own himself beaten. Should he disappoint me in exhibiting
any of the above-mentioned emotions, I certainly look forward to his
throwing himself back in his chair, drawing a long breath and
regarding me with an air of mixed wonder and admiration,
when he comee to that touching, but forcible passage (which 1
have underlined) about the perfectly unaccountable pain in my
left leg.
But ne does none of these things: he reads on calmly and quietly,
as if my remarkable statement were a conventional letter from a
distant relative, or an ordinary leading article in an English news-
paper during the recess. Sometimes he nods towards the diary,
either as if he were agreeing with it, or going to sleep over it, and
occasionally, he smiles slightly; but what he can find to smile at in
an analytical account of pains during the past week, I cannot for the
life of me make out. Evidently I have been too considerate for his
feelings, and in recounting my sufferings I have not been sufficiently
harrowing. However, he turns over the second page, and reads on.
I watch fim closely as he comes to the point about a sudden and ex-
cruciating twinge in my left knee, and in my ancle. He doesn't
move a muscle of his countenance. I know / did when I felt it.
Clearly, I couldn't have put it strongly enough. He turns over to the
fourth page: açain I wafcoh him narrowly. Surely the recital of
crackling pains in every joint, and a kind of Catherine-wheel in both
great toes, ending in a coruscation of fireworks of pain all over my
body, ought at least to make him gravely shake his head. But it
doesn't. He has reached the end of my piteous narrative, he has read
the exhaustive analysis, he sees sitting before Ытп, "the subject of
the present memoir," feverishly awaiting his verdict, and after
folding up the paper and handing it back to me, he adjusts his
spectacles go as to focus me thoroughly, and take me in, as it were,
all at once, and then with a smile,—actually with a smile, and of the
utmost benevolence too,—he says, " Capital!" _
I am so astonished, I can only ejaculate gaspingly, "Eh?" as if I
hadn't heard aright.
"Capital!" he repeats, smiling more radiantly and more benevo-
lently than before. Then tapping his hands gently one against the
other, as if he were playing "pat-a-eake Baker's man, with an
infant, he adds, "Just exactly what I had expected."
I am so utterly knocked over that I can only stare at him vacantly,
as if wondering which of us two had temporarily taken leave of his
senses. Coming to the conclusion that I am still in possession of
mine. I rouse myself for an emphatic protest.
"But," I say with animation, so that he may understand that I
am really in earnest, "surely it isn't right for me to have a pain in
my knee every night," here! rub my knee, where there is no pain at
present, "so that I can hardly sleep.
"Perfectly right," he says with composure.
"And the day before yesterday,'1 here I refer to my notes for
corroboration, "1 had such a pain all down my left leg, I couldn't
move for ten minutes."
"That's just what it ought to be," he replies, nodding com-
placently.
"But that pain in my elbow," I point to a passage in the diary
where it is graphically described, "I never had that before I came
here. It was really—most—most—" I am drying up for want of
words,—all my epithets are in the diary, and it seems weak to
repeat them— it was most aggravating."
Oh yes—no doubt," returns Dr. REM, still nodding at me
encouragingly, "but it couldn't be better. Indeed I should have
been sorry it you hadn't had it. I should have been afraid the
waters weren't doing you any good."
"What P" I exclaim. Then, as if I were trying to bring him to
reason. I expostulate calmly with him, and, adopting a conciliatory
tone, I attempt to demonstrate to him that at all events a pain right
across the forehead can't be a good sign.
'On the contrary," he replies. "Excellent."
'And my sleeplessness? I ask.
'Perfect," he answers, briskly.
'The pains in my ancles?" I go on.
'Firsts-rate," he says, rubbing his hands gleefully.
'And in my toes?
'Just where it ought to he," he returns, highly pleased.
'And in my back, and wrists, and—so that I can t walk—and over
my knees, ana such a cramp at night that I have to jump out of bed
and stamp in agony?" I ask, piling up all the symptoms together in
my despair.
"It's splendid!" says Dr. REM, perfectly beaming with rapture
at what he immediately explains to me are certain and unmistakable
signs that the Waters of Royat are really doing their work on me in
the most satisfactory manner possible. "You will continue," says
Dr. REH, dipping his pen in the ink preparatory to entering the
ordonnances, his own note-book, "you will continue as you have
begun, only varying it with an increasing dose." And then he am-
plifies his former instructions.
While he is writing them out, I am meditating on the unexpected
turn events have taken. I shall give up keeping my Diary of Pains
and Penalties. If I am to go on suffering them, where '» the use of
mentioning my sufferings? If, on the contrary, I am entirely free
from any pain, then I should nave nothing to write down, but the
sooner I saw the Doctor the better. As Dr. REM hands me the
prescription I say, dubiously, "Then, in fact, the worse I am, the
better I am. Is that so?"
"Quite so. You 're going on admirably. Come and see me again
in four or five days."
On the threshold I pause for a last question—" But if within the
next two days I am absolutely free from any pain, shall I come to
see you at once?"
"Yes, certainly. Do so by all means. Good morning. Au
revoir!" And still nodding and smiling encouragingly, Dr. REM
bows me out, and, having concluded my visit, I find that Cousin
JANE is waiting for me to take her in to breakfast.
"You feel quite well, and have no pains?" I say to her.
"No-none. Why?"
"Well "Then I tell her the result of my interview, and deduce
therefrom that she must be in a parlous state to feel so perfectly
well, and that the sooner she consults Dr. REM the better.
But she only laughs, and says she shall "leave Well alone, and
continue the Waters."
And the Waters have made her quite sprightly. I 'ye never heard
her make anything resembling a joke before, and this is uncommonly
like one. But if everyone acted on the principle " let Well alone,"
who would go to Royat or Aix or anywhere where the Springs of life
are? Somehow I am depressed. The Colonel will cheer me up. To
breakfast!

SOMETHING AFTER HALL.
IT is said that the rather unsightly building
at Hammersmith, Fulham, West Kensington,
or East Kew (the address is doubtful when
we get beyond the Addison Road), to be
shortly known as "the New Agricultural
Hall," is nearing completion. If it is intended
to rival the "original," at Islington, it is
scarcely likely to attain success, as the Public
are loth to give up old favourites in favour of
new acquaintances. At present the aims of
the coming establishment, seem a little vague.
The Morning Post truly says, " The place has
been gradually and almost without notice,
rising into existence ; " and it may be added
that had it not been for certain proceedings
interesting to lawyers a few years ago, many of
the Public would possibly have been ignorant
of its erection. To quote the same authority,
"The scope of the new project is extensive;
for although nominally an Agricultural Hall,
the building will be a centre for almost any,
and every_ display that modern ingenuity in
the direction of exhibitions and entertain-
ments can devise,"—thus enabling the Per-
forming Flea, the Baby Show, ana the Royal
Jubilee World's Fair and Grand International
Exhibition, to meet alternately on a common
platform. The Morning Post adds, "The
Brat purpose to which it will probably he
devoted, will be a gigantic hippodrome, hut
this is more or less undecided. Surely a
menagerie would have been more appropriate P
Somehow or other the scheme is not altogether
unsuggestive of elephants—white ones!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAEI.
A STORY FOR A SUMMER NUMBER.
(To be filled in to auu the niustrations.)

MIBTH AND MYSTERY.
(Prize Design for the Cover of a Summer Number.)
I л и an old man now, and as I sit in my easy chair, my little
grandchildren flock around my legs, and with wondering eyes, ask
me for a story. (Chance for Artist. Baronial Hall with armour,
with Grandfather and little one».) Sometimes my thoughts stray
away to the quiet Chapel hard by, in which lie all my ancestors and
my darling wife. ( Chance for Artist. Initial Vignette of Abbey
by moonlight.) And then I am very sad, but as a rule I am a hale
and hearty veteran, and as merry as the best of them. When I am
in my gay mood, I tell the youngsters a right frolicsome anecdote.
Here is a sample.
Years ago when I was fresh from the University, when I had just
left Oxford with its wine parties—( Chance for Artist. Scene from
College life.)—and its Schools, and had come up to town, I naturally
went a great deal into society. Àt a dance one evening in Eton
Square, I met a most charming girl—(Chance for Artist. Exterior
of Mansion with iinkman.)—who, I fear found me rather dull
company.
"You tell me," she said, as we stood under some spreading branches
and Chinese lanterns—(Chance for Artist. The Conservatory.)—
"You tell me, that you nave not been to Lord' s,.the Academy, toany
of the Theatres, and have read no new books?
"I am obliged to confess, that yon are indeed right," I admitted—
we spoke in rather a pedantic way in 1876—" To tell the truth, I
have had little time away from my studies. To achieve success it
was necessary that I should know no leisure."
"Not even to read the novel that every one is talking of?" asked
the fair girl coquettishly, toying with her bouquet in the supper-
room, to which apartment we had now proceeded. (Chance for
Artitt. The Supper. Pine-apples. Plate and Footmen.)
"What novel? f' I replied.
"Why. Burnt Mill Meadow. But perhaps you don't approve of
it?" And again the fair girl looked at me with bewitching coquetry.
"I neither approve nor disapprove," I returned, somewhat piqued
at her raillery. "I have never read it—nay, more, the title is novel
to me."
"You mean the book," she said, smilingly, disengaging herself
From me (by this time she had completed a rather hearty supper),
and taking the arm of a gentleman of military appearance, she
added, "You will excuse me, but I am engaged for the cotillon—
(Chance for Artitt. The Cotillon.)—bo Captain DASHAWAY."
And with a silvery laugh she was gone.
When I got home to my chambers in St. James's Street I found a
.utter waiting for me. I opened it, and was reminded that I had
illowed my subscription to BROWS AJTD NEPHEWS' Circulating
Library to expire.
"The very thing,"_I murmured, as 1 went to bed. "To-morrow
I will supply the omission, and obtain Burnt Mill Meadow at the
railway book-stall."
After my matutinal meal in my rooms on the following morning—
( Chance for Artist. Breakfast in Bachelors' Chambers in St. James's
Street. Foils, cards of invitation, and toast-rack.)—I went down to
the Albert Station, and, handing ш a cheque, renewed my subscrip-
tion, and asked for the volume.
"Very sorry, Sir, but it isn't in," replied the clerk. (Chancefor
Artist. Albert Station, with Book-stall and Departing Continental
Train in the distance.) "The fact is that, after the first demand, no
one wanted it, and we sent it up the line.
"How can I get it?" I asked, rather angrily.
"By transferring your subscription to any of our Stalle in the
Provinces."
No sooner said than done. I selected a Station, and then obtained
a ticket for the new dépôt. On my way I passed the scene of a
recent disaster—(Chance for Artist. The Accident to the Great
Southern Express—a leap fur life)—but arrived safely.
"Burnt Mill Meadow," repeated the provincial clerk. "Ah, to
be sure, we did have it, but it has been called in. You won't get it,
Sir, unless you go to our head-office, and buy it at a reduced price."
Again I travelled along the line, reached London, and passing
through the Strand at the busiest time of the day—( Chance for
Artist. The Strand at the busiest time of the day)—made my way
to the palatial premises of X. I. BROWN AND NEPHEWS.
"All gone; all sold! " was the business-like reply to my applica-
tion for the coveted novel. "You may get it at PUDIE'S."
I went to PODIE'S, but was unsuccessful, and could not find it at
the Green-and-YaQery Gallery—another well-known Circulating
Library. However, the custodian dropped a hint.
"If you were going abroad, now," said he, "you might possibly
pick it up. It has been appropriated by Vicomte PICNITZ."
Acting upon this suggestion (the London Season was now at an
end), I started for Pans. We had a rough crossing—( Chance for
Artist. Between Dover and Calais on the Mail-boat)—and I was
only too glad to und myself safe and sound in the court-yard of the
Grand Hôtel. I immediately drove to [the Rue de Rivoli—( Chance
for Artist. Street-Life in Pari»)—and entering GALIGNASI'S, asked
for Burnt Mill Meadow.
"Afraid you can't get one," said the man behind the counter,
shaking his head. "Ibelieve it is out of print."
By this time my blood was up. I made up my mind to obtain it
it all hazards. I travelled all over Germany, through the Alps—
[ Chancefor Artist. The Avalanche)—into Spain, where I joined in
the dissipations of the people—(Chancefor the Artist. Scene at the
Bull Fight—Death of the Toreador)—and thence into Italy. But,
fo where I would, seek where I could, I found no trace of the lost
volume. Then, at length, thoroughly dispirited, I returned home,
aausing for an hour or two at Boulogne. I walked into SADFEOST'S
English Library, a favourite haunt in years gone by.
"Pardon me," said an old gentleman, who was reading the news-
paper as I entered, "but you are very ill. I am a Doctor, and am
ilarmed at your condition. Tell me frankly what is the matter?"
I explained that I was disappointed in obtaining a novel, whose
search had become a mania.
"I believe that, if I could only find Burnt Mill Meadow"
"Burnt Mill Meadow.'" echoed the representative of Mr. SAD-
FROST. "Why, we have a copy. It is the very last. It was returned
» us by a scrupulous Englishman, who wished it sent back to
Vicomte PICNITZ, as he heard that the work had been called in. I
don't know whether, under the circumstances, I should give it to
rou, but"
"But I do," interrupted the old Doctor, taking the volume out of
lie attendant's hands and presenting it to me. "That book, Sir,
ias saved your life!"
There was no time for thanks, or further explanation, as at that
moment a signal was made that the boat was about to start. ( Chance
for Artist. The Doctor at Boulogne. Eccentric comedy with comely
French fisher-girls looking in at the doorway.) Overjoyed I hurried
on board. I am not a good sailor, so could give no attention to the
volume until I reached England. Once ashore, I hastened to a
secluded spot on the Pier, and greedily opened the book. Before I
•mild read a line of it, it was seized, and wrested from me.
"I must take that, Sir,—it is contraband in England," and ere I
lad time to protest, the Custom House Officer tossed the volume I
о much treasured into the water! I never saw it again!
I went mad! For many years I remembered nothing! At length,
hanks to a curative course at the Catford Retreat, I was restored to
full mental health. But I was old before my time.
Even now as I write, the sad memory of my great disar
so cruel, and oh, so hard to bear !) comes back to me, and
n spite of my grandchildren's merry voices, I shall soon
Vbat is this? As I write, the room grows dark, my strf
and the pen falls from my feeble faltering fingers. Л1
last!! ( Chance for Artist. The Old MaJt grave.)

THE following extract from the Cautious Continental Travellers' Conversation Guide-
Book, may be found useful at the present moment to intending visitors to France :—
The invalid gentleman in the Bath-chair is not a Prussian General of Division, but the
husband of my mother-in-law.
1 cannot establish the truth of my assertion by the immediate production of his certificate
of baptism, marriage-licence, family-tree or other documentary evidence, but I can cause to
be brought over from England his family solicitor, who will swear to his identity.
I would rather spend the next few days at the nearest Hôtel, than in the city dungeon.
These manacles and leg-irons are too tight.
Why are my wife, her sister, my two maiden aunts, the husband of my mother-in-law,
and the Welsh gentleman whom we met by
chance at the Railway Station, all being con-
ducted with drawn swords to the pri son-van.
Yes, I will pledge you my word that
neither my wife, nor her sister, nor my two
maiden aunts, nor the husband of my
mother-in-law, nor the Welsh gentleman
whom we met by chance at the Railway
Station, are related directly to Prince
BISMAECK.
This book is not, as you imagine, a com-
pendium of German hieroglyphics for secret
signalling, but a last month's BRADSHAW'S
Sixpenny Railway Guide.
Nor is the old Ulster I am wearing the
usual undress overcoat of a Prussian cavalry
officer of distinction. The Juge d'Instruc-
tion is wrong in supposing that the address
of Highbury on my cards stands for Heidel-
berg in Saxon.
1 am glad to hear that my wife, her
sister, my two maiden mints, flie husband
of my mother-in-law, and the Welsh gentle-
man whom we met by chance at the Railway
Station, are to be let out after only two
days' incarceration on bread and water, and
merely subjected to police supervision, with-
out permission to quit the place.
Do you think that the intervention of the
British Consul would procure my removal
to a cell less infested by rats?
I am relieved to think that we are sud-
denly dismissed as " detained in error," and
told to pack out of the place as soon as pos-
sible, without any apology.
I think, therefore, that as we have been
subjected to some inconvenience, I, and my
wife, and her sister, my two maiden aunts,
the husband of my mother-in-law, and the
Welsh gentleman whom we met by chance
at the Railway Station, will communicate
the circumstances quietly to the Times
newspaper.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
KXTUACTKII ПК1М
THE DIARY OF TOBT, M.P.
Monday, September 6.—Exciting scene in House of Lords. Quarter
past Four Duke of BUCKINGHAM AND CHANDOS took seat on the
Woolsack in absence of LORD CHANCELLOR. Constitution requires
presence of three Peers to make a quorum. Only the Lord Viscount
Grand CBOSS, present in body ot House. Question: was this a
quorum?
"Certainly," said the Duke of BUCKINGHAM AND CHANDOS. "I 'm
two and you re another."
The Lord Viscount disposed to argue matter. Controversy inter-
rupted by arrival of STBATHEDEN AND CAMPBELL.
"Now we're five," said BUCKINGHAM AND CHANDOS, "andwill
proceed with the orders of the day."
Business over in five minutes.
"A minute for each of us," said the Duke.
In the Commons two hundred melancholy Members present; spent
the sitting in discussing Army Estimates. Whenever division called,
50, more or less, voted in one lobby, and 150, more or less, in the
other.
Sage of Queen Anne's Gate made gallant effort to prohibit mili-
tary bands playing at political demonstrations. Proposed to dock
the wages ot 1038 drummers provided for in Estimates. Defeated
on division by the usual 150 against 50, but got promise from War
Minister to look into matter. Meanwhile, Colonel WARING proposes
to make arrangements for recognition of the Sage's work. The 1038
drummers to assemble at Queen Anne's Gate and serenade the
Sage.
Dr. TANNER distinguished himself throughout Sitting, jumping up
on every Vote. "Always coming back like a bad tanner," as CAMP-
BELL-BANNERMAN said. JOSEPH Gnxis regards Member for Mid-
Cork with kind of pathetic interest. "They're gjettin' too much for
me, TOBY," he said to-night, with a sob in his voice. "I can't keep
pace with 'em. I 'm gettin' on in years, and, what 's worse, am
feeling benumbed with a sense of respectability. Like STAFFOBD
NOBTHCOTE I feel there 's no go about me, and shouldn't wonder if,
in a year or two.1, like him, retire to the House of Lords." The dear
old JOEY B. l He certainly is getting uncommonly respectable as
compared with the young bloods : wears gloves constantly now; sus-
pends his pince-nez by the black ribbon affected by benevolent old
gentlemen. "He 's qualifying for the Peerage," the Boys say, as they
gaze at him affectionately.
Business done.—Army Estimates.
Tuesday,—Another exciting seven minutes in the Lords. Still
difficulty about forming quorum. Efforts made to secure STBATH-
EDEN AND CAMPBELL. With BUCKINGHAM AND CHANDOS on the Wool-
sack, that would make a quorum, and one over. But S. & C.
won't come. "You won't have me when I want to speak," he says,
"and when you want me you must
just wait." Neither is RICHMOND AND
GOBDON to be had. Doesn't think so
much of the Markise as he once did.
MILLTOVN waylaid, and brought in.
"Well, as we are
here," says he, "may
_^д as well amuse our-
/ selves. Supposing we
play at riddles? Post-
Office people order that
an envelope opened at
the side be charged at
a higher rate than the
same matter inclosed in
an envelope open at
the ends. Very well. Sup-
posing that I send out a
square envelope, which are
the sides, and which the
ends?"
BUCKINGHAM gave it up
at once. (" Off with his
head!" said MILLTOWN.)
CHANDOS asked for notice.
III.LTOWX accordingly
gave notice to put the
question on Thursday.
Riddles also in Com-
mons. Best put by Ad-
miral COMMEBELL. Subject
under discussion Navy Estimates, with special reference to the
guns. WOOD ALL, in ingenious speech, rather made out that.it is

"Nine times before it burst!'
an advantage, especially in hot weather, to have guns accustomed
to blow off their breeches. He knew a gun to have been fired nine
times before it burst! (Signs of incredulity.) He begged to pro-
pose the health of the fragments. (General assent.)
It was after this Admiral COMMEBELL came aboard with his
conundrum.
"Sir," he said. "what I want to know is. how is it that there's
more danger in the rear of pur guns than in front of them?"
Committee considered this [for five hours. At quarter past Two
in the morning gave it up, and adjourned.
Business done.—Navy Estimates.
Thursday.—In Lords to-night MILLTOWN'S conundrum fired off.
The Markise feebly took refuge in assertion that Postal Authorities
didn't understand the question. Speaking for himself, admitted that
it would be very difficult with square envelope to say which was
the top and which the side. MILLTOWN naturally elated at thug
flooring the House. Going to think of another conundrum for next
week.
In the Commons, the Sage of Queen Anne's Gate "went for"
RANDOLPH. Amongst other things, blandly proposed to reduce his
salary by £3,000. Argued the matter out in quietest manner, show-
ing his proposition based upon sound logic and considerations of
public welfare. RANDOLPH'S naturally equable temper slightly

ruffled. Just been behind the Chair in interview with HABTINGTON
and CHAMBERLAIN. Sir CHARLES FOKSTEB tells me they don't quite
agree in view of arrangements made for introduction of PARNELL'S
Bill. RANDOLPH been explaining matters. Doubtful whether he
has satisfied both.
After such ordeal, a little trying to come back and listen to pro-
position to reduce your salary by more than one-half. Boiling
over with rage, but severely silent. Committee on division votes
full salary.
House, generally, in a cranky "state, Members constantly wan-
dering off upon irrelevant excursions, sternly brought back by the
SPEAKER.
JOSEPH GILLIS, breaking long silence, begins a discussion on cost
of evictions.
"Out of order," says the SPEAKEB.
JOEY B. meekly sits down. Ah me! How times change.
"How's this, JOSEPH?" I said, coming later upon the old man.
"Expected you'd have had it out with the SPEAKEB, and shown him
he was wrong."
"Not now, TOBY; not now," he said, with something like a sigh.
"It's vulgar. You wouldn't have me demane myself to the level
of TANNEB or MAT HARRIS?"
Business done.—Not very much.

Friday.—Supply again. Got through
the business much as a man crosses a room
strewn with lucifer matches. Every now
and then a flash of flame and a crackle.
Few more paces taken quietly, and again
the flash and the explosion. GEORGE
CAMPBELL trod on a match when he threat-
ened to divide Committee because RAN-
DOLPH had not given him conciliatory
reply. RANDOLPH, who had through the
sitting kept his temper
with rare success, flared
up at this. Offered to

spot. Was taking off his
coat as preliminary to
perations, when HICKS-
JEACH gently, but firmly,
buttoned it across his
chest.
Chiefest explosion

JESSE of having invoked
the aid of JOSEPH to

fixed'at £1,200. JOSEPH and JESSE both absent—gone forth arm-in-
arm in search of holiday pleasures. No one to say a word for them,
and, in the end, vote reduced by £300. "Can't help smiling," said
JACOBY. After this, a great calm of satisfaction fell over Committee,
and money voted with increased rapidity.
Business done.—Votes in Supply.

HINTS TO NEW MEMBERS.
MANY new Members of the House of Commons having written to
Mr. Punch for his advice as to the best means of "getting on" in
Parliament, he has prepared for their guidance a few simple and in-
fallible rules :—
1. As soon as you have taken your seat, write a note to the
SPEAKER, and tell him to call upon you at a certain hour—say half-
past six. He will not venture to disregard this notice. Speak at as
great a length as you can, beginning a sentence occasionally with,
And now a few words in conclusion." This keeps alive the
pleasures of hope in the breasts of your audience.
2. Half the battle consists in founding your method of speaking
upon a good model. Dr. TANNER, for instance, has a very attractive
manner, or if yon prefer the fine old Roman style, take Mr. CONY-
BEARE. A persuasive and brilliant delivery may be acquired from
imitation of Dr. CLARKE, or Sir GEORGE CAMPBELL. As regards
management of the voice, you cannot do better than study the
system adopted by Sir. N. KAY-SHUTTLEWORTH.
3. When you have spoken, sit down upon your hat. This is a very
favourite performance, and when well executed—as it was lately by
Mr. R. G. WEBSTER—never fails to bring down the House. Take
a new hat with you for this particular occasion.
4. Cultivate a good loud cough or sneeze, and practise it whenever
an interesting speech is being made. It prevente you being over-
looked. In the midst of an effective peroration from the G. 0. M. or
Lord RANDOLPH, a tremendous sneeze—or even a loud trumpeting
from the nose—has a very happy effect. Better to be known for
your sneeze than to be lost in the general crowd.
5. Go and have a chat with the SPEAKER occasionally. Recollect
that he must be lonely, perched up in that chair all night, and
naturally he longs for an opportunity of comparing notes with new
Members on the personal appearance and style of the chief leaders
and debaters. Climb uç on his chair, and sing out in his ear, "Mr.
PEEL!" Yon will receive immediate attention.
6. Rise whenever you think proper, and call an old Member to
order. Yon may be quite in the wrong, but never mind—it gives
you importance, and draws upon you the favourable notice of the
SPEAKER, who is always very glad to be reminded of his duty—
especially by new Members.
7. When yon dine in the House, take a seat at the table set apart
for Ministers. This is generally recognised as an assertion of your
claim to official position, and you are pretty sure to get some post or
other when the next vacancy arises.
8. If yon consider yourself good-looking, walk up and down the
House 'frequently, and make yourself as conspicuous as possible.
This pleases the ladies in the Gallery. After a division, just as the
ttfJers are bowing to the SPEAKER, go and stand close to the table as
:<f!

CANNY.
"WHY I DINNA PRAYFAIR TAB SMOKE, HECH? WEEL, NOO,
LODDIE, I 'LL JOOST TELL YE. WHILES YB 'BE SMOKING, YE BLAW
AN' BLAW, AN' тгиАия л'г? Вит GIN YE ТАК A euro PENCH,

if you were about to receive their report. Everybody must then see
you, and your blue eyes, raven hair, or what not must be sufficiently
admired. You cannot hope to cut out Sir RICHARD TEMPLE, but you
need not let him have it all his own way.
9. When selecting your seat, choose one just behind your carty
leaders, and lean over to them now and then, and give them your ideas
as to their policy, management, and so forth. Tell them what yon
think of their speeches, and keep up a running fire of commentary on
the debate. Speak your mind plainly, especially if you think your
leaders are wrong—they like it.
10. If you are a Conservative, go up to Lord RANDOLPH Снттснш
whenever you find yourself in the lobby with him, and ask him what
he intends to do aoout Ireland, why he made MATTHEWS Home
Secretary, and what is the reason he has not yet desired you to speak.
Inquire now it is that you never see him in the smoking-room now
with LABOTCHERE, and whether he has had a row with CHAMBER-
LAIN. Nothing pleases him so much as little attentions of this kind.
11. If yon find that any Member of longer standing than yourself
has occupied a particular seat to which his right is generally
respected, go and take it at once. Sentimental nonsense about
courtesy will not go down in these Democratic days. Let the old
Member understand that you are the Coming Man, and that your
portrait has been in the Penny Gusher, or the Evangelical Foghorn.
He will soon see the propriety of giving way to you.
12. If you notice Sir WILLIAM HABCOURT sitting alone at any
time, take your place by his side, and enter into conversation. You
will find him easy of access, and diffident'and affable in manner. If you
ask him a few pertinent questions—such as the date of his speech on
Conservatives stewing in Parnellite juice, how it was he became con-
verted to Home Rule, why he was called Sir Lucros 0'TRIG GER the
other day, and so forth—you will receive from him a reception which
will long linger in your memory.
By following these directions, the ambitious new Member cannot
fail to " get on," though whether it will be in the dcnred direction or
not, can only be ascertained after due trial and experience.
SQUARING THE "CIRCLE."—A Correspondent claims to have almost
solved this problem. He can, he says, procure "Orders" for the
Upper Boxes at nearly every theatre in London.
AN IRISH REMEDY.—Having examined the draft of Mr. PARNELL'S
Land Bill, one of his party expressed a fear that Landlords would
find that draught a bitter pill.
AN ORANGE OUTRAGE,—Covent Garden Market.
TV" TO CORRESPONDENTS.—In no ease can Contributions, whether US., Printed Mutter, or Drawings, be retained, anlese accompanied
by a Stamped and Directed Envelope or Cover. Copies of MS. should bo kept by the Senden.

DEAS CHARLIE,
I 'ir down on my luck'and no error, dear boy. Got the sack!
All along of a, dashed German Sossidge, whose nut I should jest like to crack.
I got a bit bosky one night with some pale who 'ad won on a race.
The Boss tipped me the mitten neit day, and young Yah-yah* pops into my

Pooty sort of nice thing for a Briton! It 's wot I call beastly, old man.
These 'ere Germans know three or four tongues, and can live on thin swipes and
cold scran;
They ain't got no more go than a hoyster, cares little for lotion and larks.
And so they sneaks into our slippers, the nasty mean tow-headed sharks!
I 'ate all dashed foniners, CHABLIE, I do s'elp me never, dear boy.
They 'ave gabs as we carnt understand, and play games as we cannot enjoy,
Yet they swarms over 'ere like muskeeters, French, Germans, Hightalians, and

University, CHABLIE, for bagmen and shopmen and clerks and our sort?
All my eye and a bandbox, my biffin. Life would be a proper fine sport
If we ad to learn two or three languidges, grammar, and sech tommy rot,
Turn 'ermits and book-sucking sneaks, and get two quid a week for the lot!
No, CHABLIE, that may suit the Germans, the pap-blooded'gruel-brained mugs,
Who crawl into our shops and our horfices, jest like the moth into rugs,
And 'edge hout us chaps with more sperrit and less forrin lingo and fat,
But it 's rather too good enough, CHARLIE, for fellers like hus, and that 's flat.
Wy, the Sossidge as collared my crib is a yaller-'aired mustard-chin'd chap,
Gig-lamps and a nose like a radish, grinds 'ard, never goes on the lap,
Reads SHAKSPEARE instead o'the Pink 'Un, and plays the planner like steam;
But 'as no more ideer of a barney, dear boy, than a Teddington bream.
And this ochre-nob'd juggins from Germany comes and jumps into my shoes,
Jest because I 'm not dab at the Yah-yah, and 'appened to go on the booze.
Call that patriotic, my pippin? Should kick all dashed forriners out!
Or else where 's the good of the Tories, and wot is Lord RANDOLPH about?
I did think when the Rads was conflobbed, and that traitor, Old COLLARS, was
dished,

A CORRECTION.—In our notice of The Theatre Magazine, two numbers ago,
we mentioned an interesting article in it signed "CHARLES HERVET" as being
written by M. HERVÉ, the composer of some Opérai Souffes, who within 1 the
last twenty year» has paidperfidious Albion the great compliment of becoming a
naturalised Englishman. This was an error on our part, as the article in question
wae the work of a genuine Englishman, whose reminiscences of foreign operatic
history are well worth preserving.
VOL. xci о
FROM THE GROVES OF BLARNEY.
MB. FITZSERALD MOLLOT, an earnest and indefatigable
author of verv readable books, particularly interesting to
students of the History of the Drama, has written a new
work entitled Famous Plays, of which Messrs. WAJID
AND DOWNEY are the publishers. By way of "puff pre-
liminary," the author, probably advised by the "downy"
member of the firm, has sent out a leaflet containing a
prefatial dedication of his book to "HENRY IRVING,
Esquire." He pays him the high compliment, not un-
merited, of saying that " since GARHICK (why not DAVID
GARHICK, Esquire) died, no player has studied more per-
sistentlv, or laboured more strenuously, to elevate the
Stage than you."
Admitting this, we are not unmindful of MACREADT,
PHELPS, and CHARLES KEAN, Esquires.
He rightly eulogises HENRY IRVING, Esquire's, "in-
genious powers" and "liberal enterprise," and adds that
m consequence of his possession of these qualities, "the
greatest English poet of our day has been accepted as a
playwright." If Mr. MOLLOY means Lord TENNYSON, and
not Mr. WILLS, it is true'that his plays of The Cup and
Queen Mary were " accepted " and acted. HENRY IRTIN»,
Esquire, and Miss ELLEN TERRY, with a magnificent scene,
made the success of the first; but nothing and nobody
could make a success of the latter. If these, with Becket,
the "idyllic" Falcon, and The Promise of May, which
was such a hopeless frost," entitle the Laureate to be
"accepted as a playwright," then we strongly suspect that
Mr. MoLLor, with true native humour, will be saying,
aside, in a stage-whisper, "Sure, I didn't say what sort
of a playwright!"
Further on he tells "HENRY iRvmo, Esquire " that his
scholarly conceptions and powerful representations "have
wrested weighed admiration from an unemotional age, and
wrung [it] from an unimaginative Nation." Mr. MOLLOY
is evidently poking his fun at us, and, it may be, at
"HENRY IRVING, Esquire;" for how on earth can a Nation
be "unimaginative" which imagines Lord TENNYSON to
be a real good playwright!
"Your stage," says Mr. MOLLOY, "has become the
sanctuary of Art, your theatre the home of Culture."
"Och! BLARNBY MOLLOY
Was a broth of a Boy!"
who, if he does not deserve a niche in the Temple of
Fame, has at least merited a stall in the front row of
"The Home of Culture;" i.e., the Lyceum Theatre,
Wellington Street, Strand.
Mr. Punch cordially recognises the justice of the tribute
rendered to " HENRY IRVING, Eequire," but at the same
time he cannot help wishing that Mr. MOLLOY had not
kissed the Blarney Stone to such excellent purpose before
writing this preface.

THEATRICAL SPORT IN SEPTEMBER.
MY DEAR MR. NIBBS,—No doubt learning that you had left England
for Foreign Parts for a week or ten days, and consequently (to put it
colloquially) ."were not looking," the Managers of two Theatres have
seized the opportunity of producing a couple of plays new to a London
audience. Feeling that this was not quite right, I think it my duty to
report the matter to you and tell you all about them. At the Princess's
Sister Mary is a new piece by Messrs. CLEMENT SCOTT and WILSON
BARRETT, or, as the playbills have it, Messrs. WILSON BARRETT
and CLEMENT SCOTT. I found it a little difficult to distinguish the
handiwork of the two Authors, to recognise where CLEMENT ended
and WILSON began, or what should go to SCOTT and what belonged to
BARRETT, until I remembered that one of the collaborateurs was a
gentleman of great literary ability, and in his earlier days a much-
respected official at the War Office. Assisted by this clue, I came to
the conclusion that the writing must be by Mr. SCOTT, and the many
practical jokes with which the piece was burdened must owe their
invention to Mr. BARRETT. The last Act of Sitter Mary is intensely
military, and, consequently, a test to the respective shares of its
joint authors. I feel convinced that Mr. SCOTT would never allow a
mistake to be made in the details of a soldier's uniform; and when I
noticed that one of the reformed villains of the play wore the tunic
and trousers of a Sergeant in the Line, and the white helmet of either
an Artilleryman or a Royal Engineer, I was certain that I had de-
tected the jocular hand of Mr. BARRETT. Given this piece of plea-
santry as Mr. WILSON'S invention, like eccentricities in the piece
are also identified as his property. Thus, the quaint idea of the
heroine falling in love with the hero when he is in a condition of
comic intoxication, and the humorous notion of the same heroine
introducing her betrothed on the morning of their wedding to his
unknown and unexpected infant, no doubt are both Mr. BARRETT'S
facetious fancies. But putting aside these eccentricities (because
the question of their appropriateness might be a matter of opinion),
the play is a very good one. The acting, taken all round, is
quite up to the average of a first-class London company, although
the dramatis persona made their initial appearance before a pro-
vincial audience. Miss MAGGIE HUNT, as the mother of the in-
fant, plays with much earnestness; but, by her extremely attrac-
tive appearance, renders the hesitation of the hero to marry her
highly improbable. Mr. LEONARD BOYNE tones down the rascality
of the faithless object of two women's affections by cleverly sug-
gesting (so it seemed to me) in the Second and Third Acts that he
has not quite recovered from the intemperate habits which appeared
to be habitual to him in Scene the First. Miss LTNGARD also has a
prominent character in the play, and exhibits her usual intensity.
As some of the speeches put in this lady's mouth are rather sug-
gestive of the leading articles of a daily paper, when I learned at the
end of the last Act that the anti-blue-ribbonite hero was to marry
her, I felt that poetic justice had been completely satisfied.
The piece I witnessed at the Vaudeville was called Curiosity, and
I am glad to say it was announced for one representation only. The
less that is said about it the better. When Ttell you that the central
idea is the endeavour of two Ladies to get rid of their bunions and
"decayed molars," to quote the Authors words, unknown to their
lovers, you may guess the quality of the production. Honestly I do
not remember ever having seen a more disagreeable play. Even the
admirable acting of Miss LARKIN could not make it tolerable. It is
by a Mr. DERRICK, who has scarcely the excuse of inexperience, if
(as I am given to understand is the case) Curiosity is his second, if
not third, published attempt at writing an amusing Comedy.
I may add that I am told that Turned Up is a. success at the
Royalty, and Mrs. CONOVER quite unique as Lady Macbeth at the
Olympic. Places should be taken in advance for the first, but no
such precaution for obtaining admission is necessary at the second.
Still, both, so I am informed, are highly diverting.
With greatest respect, allow me to remain, dear Mr. Nrese,
CHARLES TOUR FRIEND.

To the Editor of the "Daily Startler."
Snt.—I can quite confirm what your Correspondent " CHIPPLE FOB
LIFE," states as to the unsafe condition of the Gray's Inn Road.
Yesterday afternoon I was walking1 on the pavement in broad day-
light, when no fewer than sixteen hulking fellows dashed at me from
a narrow opening, where no doubt they had all been concealed!
Considering their superiority in numbers, their conduct in knocking
me down and then breaking five of my ribs with kicks, before taking
my watch and purse, was singularly unjustifiable. They might have
proceeded with much less energy and precipitancy, especially as—a
fact which I afterwards discovered—there did not appear to be a
policeman anywhere nearer than King's Cross! I think Sir CHABLES
WABBEN should do something really handsome for

SIK,—Being obliged by my business often to make use of the
Gray's Inn Road, I am surprised at the assertions of "CBTPPLE FOH
LLTE" in your late issue. I consider it a most safe and delightful
thoroughfare.^ I wish I could say the same for some parts of the
Strand. Having been several times knocked into the gutter, and
then robbed of every farthing I carried with me, I have lately adopted
the following plan whenever I have had reason to walk from
Somerset House to Charing Cross. First securing my watch in my
pocket by means of a stout galvanised iron cable, which completely
encircles my neck and waist, and terminates in a couple of anchors
embedded m my two trousers-pockets, I proceed te connect this
cable with a rather powerful dynamo concealed up my back. Well,
Sir, only two days ago my contrivance was put to the test by the
Strand thieves. Two men—whose appearance was most forbidding,
and whose mere presence in such a thoroughfare ought to have
attracted the attention of every constable in the neighbourhood—
approached me, and asked me what the time was? At the same
moment three others, coming from another direction, requested me to
supply them with a maten! I was surrounded, and the next
thing was that I felt a strong grab made at my watch-chain. I was
delighted to see that the thief was instantly floored by the electric
current. By this time, however, I myself was on my back, having been
felled by some blunt instrument, and one of the men, by an adroit
kick, managed to smash my concealed dynamo! I am afraid the
ruffian had warning of my plan, or else must have been a disguised
electrician of more than ordinary acumen. Under these circum-
stances, I was easily relieved of my watch, chain, purse, and boots,
and left insensible on the wood pavement. "When I came to my
senses, 1 found myself in a cell at the Police Station, whither I had
been taken as being "drunk and incapable"! I remained there all
night! What, Sir, I ask indignanfly, is Sir CHARLES WASBEN
doing P Yours, &c.," LONDON Tit A DESMAN.
SIB,—I have carried on business for some years in the Strand (as
an importer of genuine high-class foreign wines at the low price of
sixteen-and-sixpence a dozen), and cannot understand the complaints
made as to its insecurity.
Now there is a thoroughfare near here, which is so terribly dan-
gerous and unprotected, that I should certainly advise no one to
venture into it. I allude to St. Martin's Lane, a street in which, I
regret to say, a low rival of my own has established himself, who
has the assurance to offer what he calls wine at thirteen shillings a
dozen! Only a few nights ago my wife and a female cousin were
walking along the pavement. It was quite dark, though not very
late. Perhaps it was a little imprudent for them to be examining
the contents of their purees under a gas-lamp at such an hour, but—
would you believe it ?—a man walked up and coolly snatched my
wife's purse from her hand! Another at the same moment decamped
with the small bag which my cousin carried. A little boy, who was
standing by, and who was appealed to to follow the ruffians, only
exclaimed, "What a lark!" Worse than that, when my wife spoke
to a policeman, who was chatting with a comrade at the far end of
the street, he seemed annoyed at being disturbed, and actually
threatened to take them both into custody for causing an obstruction
in the street! And yet this is called the safest capital in Europe!
Yours remonstratingly,
September iOth. A WRATHFUL RATEPAYER.

A WATER COUESE.
VII.
The Colonel at our Table.
THE life and soul, or, at least, as the excellent SAMBORNIFS hath it,
"one of the lifee and souls," of our breakfast-table is the Colonel.
He is a remarkable man, certainly over forty, slightly bald, clean
shaved, except for a moustache tinged with grey, tallish, stoutiah,
attired in an easy-going flannel costume, seldom quiet for a moment,
and full of schemes and plans for passing the day. He has been here
barely four days, and he knows more about the capabilities of Royat
as a place of amusement, than its oldest and most influential inhabi-
tant. He has t ravel 1 «1 all orer the world, and made himself at home
everywhere and in every language.
His nationality. I believe, is Dutch; he speaks German thoroughly,
French well, English fluently, having, as I understand, obtained his
military rank in the American army. He possesses a smattering of
Italian, in which country he met a young English lady, who having
made a successful début on the operatic stage, consented to become his
wife on condition that she should not abandon her profession for at
least five^years. As her engagements soon compelled her to travel
all over Europe and America, nothing could have better suited the
Colonel's roving taste: but besides this, he was devoted to music, for
which he possesses a quick but inaccurate ear, and a memory wherein
i» stored up any amount of plots of Operas, their titles, the names of
their composers, of the singers, and the points of the leading dramatic
situations,—only all so mixed up that, when he wants any one scene,
air, name, or situation in particular, he has to rummage about in his
memory-box, whence he produces a medley, from which, after a con-
siderable time spent in sorting, he extracts the required material,
whatever it may happen to be.
With a special liking for artistes and artistic life, he has dabbled
in journalism, and has on two or three occasions acted, in an amateur
way, as " Our Own Correspondent Abroad." Nothing gives him so
much pleasure as composing newspaper paragraphs, except subse-
quently seeing his compositions in print, when he is in a state of
the most gleeful excitement. These paragraphs are a matter of con-
siderable expense to him, as on the appearance of any one of them
he at only purchases an extensive number of copies, which he posts
to friends all over the world.
He is already on the friendliest terms with the j ournalists of Royat,
and on the second morning of our arrival he comes into breakfast
flourishing one of the local papers, and exclaiming, "Look I see!
what tey say in ter paper, and then he reads out a flaming
paragraph, in which after introducing all our names among the " dis-
tinguished arrivals," a graceful compliment is paid to the eminent
Dr. HAMMOND Pr i IHN KY. on his great wisdom in selecting Royat,
above all other Stations Thermales, for the sojourn of his patiente.
"Who on earth put this in?" I ask, innocently.
The Colonel chuckles with delight, but shrugs his shoulders and
professes to be absolutely ignorant on the subject. As, however, hi§
thorough acquaintance with phrases in the paragraphs is remarkable,
and as ne knows so precisely where to put his finger on the passages
which, as he considers, constitute the beauty of the work, I cannot help
expressing my opinion that their inspirer, if not their actual author, is
not two hundred yards from our breakfast-table.
"Ah ! "cries the Colonel, in a perfect ecstasy of shrugs and winke
fraught with unutterable meaning, "I cannot tell! Ido not ask.
But tey get tese things in somehow. See !" he cries out to Ms wife,
who just then enters the room, "See, my dear, what they say about
you! It is nice! Very nice! I must send it to some friends."
Though his English is generally delivered with only the slightest
possible accent, our " th," being an occasional difficulty, yet on the
whole there are peculiarities of manner, intonation and emphasis,
which are evidence of his foreign origin.
Then the Colonel has a few more papers to show, journals from
other localities, with longer accounts of Madame ROSETTA'S (her
professional name) triumphant career, and a sonnet addressed to
her, not only as a genuine tribute of admiration for her talents, but
even more for the use to which she so frequently puts them, singing
for local charities which benefit largely by Her unvarying good-nature.
The Colonel is radiant, as he draws our attention to the, first
verse :—
"Quand vous chantez, Madame, on accourt, on s'empresse,
Fût-ce même à l'église, on vous aime, on vous suit,
Voue forcez le sceptique à se rendre à la messe,
A défaut de la foi, le charme l'y conduit."
"Regardez! the heading!" says the Colonel, and then we notice
that most of this information contained in the journal of another
water-cure place not Royat, comes under the title oî "Le High-
Life.'" But this is of the past, and just now the Colonel's chief
delight is in our own local paper, where the writer of the para-
graph felicitating Royat on our arrival, finishes with "Et remer-
ciant encore une fois, —"You see, tey've done it before," says the
Colonel, who, in the exuberance of his enjoyment, is nodding and
winking at everybody round the table and at friends seated at a
distance, for whose benefit he waves aloft the journal and goes
through a variety of pantomimic action—"le Docteur Hammond
Putteney de nous avoir amené de si charmants clients," the
"charmants clients " are Cousin JANE, Mrs. DINDEHLDT, thé American
lady (also under Cherubic care) and myself, who have all of us arrived
within the last week. It is a great morning for the Colonel.
He professes extreme devotion to the fair sex, which he expresses
in phrases and in action—specially in action—of a most exaggerated
character. On the entrance of the ladies of our party into the salle-a-
manger, he rises from his seat, bows at on angle of ninety, places his
hand on his heart, at the same time shaking his head, as if disavow-
ing all individual importance on his own account, and in a general
way going through the sort of performance to which H л к к v PAYHE, at
Christmas-time, is accustomed to treat us in the comic Bed-room
Scene, when exhibiting the effect of a suddenly-conceived passion
for a truculent-looking landlady in long black corkscrew curls, whom,
so fickle is man's attachment, he will, within the next two minutes,
send flying out of the room with a few delicate strokes from the
warming-pan; though, of course, this particular portion of the
entertainment does not form part oí the Colonel's programme.
To Cousin JANE—who has led a country life, and whose knowledge
of pantomimic politeness is not extensive—the Colonel's movements,
performed with the utmost gravity, are at first considerably em-
barrassing. But she sets it down to foreign manners, and accepte his
homage with an air of serious courtesy that would do honour to the
most stately Duchess. Mrs. TOFFAM, Ithe American lady, puts out
her hand, which he immediately kisses in the most respectful manner
possible. At this she looks across at Madame, as if expecting
some interference from her, which, however, Madame being perfectly
accustomed to these eccentricities on her husband's part, only occurs
when the Colonel's humour is of a more exuberantly rollicking
character than usual, when she says, in a warning tone, and equally
emphasising both syllables, "Ai—FEED !" whereupon he immediately
abbreviates the performance, whatever it may happen to be at the
moment, and, coming round to his wife's chair, insiste upon taking her
hand, and kissing it in the most respectful, and at the same time the
most profoundly apologetic manner; then, after Madame has given
him a playful tap on the head with her fan, saying, "AXFKF.D, you
are a great big boy—do sit down, and behave yourself properly," he
returns to his seat, and for a short time, during which he employs
himself with his breakfast, he is comparatively quiet.
He has a quick eye for ladies' costume.
"Ah, permit me to say it—you do not mind ?"—he says, address-
ing Mrs. TOFFAM, "but what a beautiful lace you have!"
"You think so," returns Mrs. TOFFAM, pleased.
"It is—is it not, my dear?"—this to his wife, who also expresses
her admiration of it, and smilee on Mrs. TOFFAM. "It ees pretty!
But—you permit me P—you do not mind?"
"No, certainly not—what is it P" asks Mrs. TOFFAM.

"Well—I notice yon have always a lit-tel pin sticking ont where it
should not—permit me"
And then lie suggests to Mrs. TOFF AH first, and afterwards to the
other ladies, such improvements as would revolutionise their entire
costume. He directs their attention, too, to the visitors.
"That one is new—she has just arrived yesterday. She is an
Actress at the Gymnase. That lady there, with the grey hair, is her
mother—How do you do, Madame?" He rises, and hows to her
across three or four tables, causing every one to turn in that direc-
tion, which confuses the unfortunate Madame CHOSE considerably.
But this is of no consequence to the Colonel, who has discovered
other celebrities, whom he is now pointing out to us. "That old
man there, décoré, like NAPOLEON THIRD, ne is a rich banker; that
is his daughter, the Countess—I forget her name. How do you do,
both?—and those whojare just taking their seats are a Spanish
family. There is a Prince somewhere—of Portugal—but he breakfasts
in his apartment—ah! look at that little fat man with moustache
and green riband—he is hia secretary"—he salutes him with a
friendly nod.
"Ah, I must not forget my family! I must feed my family!"
cries the volatile Colonel. Cousin JANE who doats on children, looks
immensely pleased, expecting to welcome the Colonel's children.
Madame observes this, and smilingly explains, "ALFRED is so
вШу. You see that box?" the Colonel is now putting bread and
bits of meat, and vegetables into a small silver box, on the table by
his plate. We'reply that we do see that box, and I remark that I
had thought it was a snuff-box, which amuses the Colonel immensely.
"Well," continues Madame, "that carries the food for his 'family,'
as he calls it. His ' family' consists of his Parrot Lili, and his little
dog Mimi, which he carries about with him everywhere."
"There !" says the Colonel, '' there is the f amily's
breakfast, and"ah!"—he cannot be quiet for a
second, but as he turns round, he sees a bright -
looking little French boy, in very wide collars, who
has paused in his walk up the room to where his
parents are breakfasting, in order to watch the
Colonel filling the box. "Ah! here is a dear little
Eton boy!" Any small boy less like an Etonian I
never saw. "How are you, my little Eton boy?"
says the Colonel, assuming an expression of fatherly
benevolence. "How are you; and tell me which
beat this year, was it Harrow or Eton?"
For a second the little boy is quite taken a-back.
"ALFRED !" remonstrates Madame, sympathising
л with the situation of the little French boy, and
"fearing lest his father and mother, who are a few
tables off watching the proceedings, should rise up
in wrath, and object to the Colonel taking such an
unwarrantable liberty with their offspring.
"I 'in not an Eton "Ah! The dear little Eton boy, he does not
Boy." unterstant! He does not know what 'Eton boy'
means, eh, mon petit?"
But the petó having quite recovered himself, replies briskly and
with complete self-possession, " Yes, I do. I'm not an Eton boy. I'm
not old enough to go to Eton yet. Eton beat Harrow this year.
Were you at Eton?"
"No, I was not," answers the Colonel, for once utterly taken a-back
and striking his flag before the little gun-boat.
"I thought not," the sharp little chap continues, speaking English
perfectly, because you would have known that Eton boys don't dress
like this. This is French, not English style. I must go to breakfast.
My papa is there. Good morning." With perfect manners, he salutes
our party collectively, and leaves the Colonel utterly discomfited.
"That will teach you, ALFRED, not to be always chaffing every-
body as you do," says Madame. "It is the biter bit ; " and we rise
and leave, for once, without the Colonel's usual pantomimic perform-
ance of bowing to the ladies, fetching their sunshades, and kissing
the tips of their fingers as they retire from the scene. The interview
with the little Eton boy, who delivered his sentences as if he were
repeating off by heart an Ollendorffian exercise, has made him
thoughtful, and, with his silver box in his hand, he disappears, to
solace himself by feeding his family, and having an interview
with the parrot, who will cheer him up by joining in the air of
"Coining Through the Rye," of which the Colonel sings the five first
words, and the parrot the last one. "If a body meet a "sings
the Colonel. "Body," sings the parrot, through his beak. "Coming
through the "sings the Colonel." Rye !" sings the parrot,—and
so on until the verse is concluded, when the bird, having sung for Ins
breakfast, duly receives it.
Within ten days the Colonel knows everybody in the Hotel. At
the end of the first week he has got up a dance, which is patronised
by Dr. I ; i : M , without whose presence, as imparting a sort of oenispn on
a form of entertainment that is certainly not included in the ordinary
traitement, the patients, when indulging in the delightful dance and
the dangerous draught afterwards, might feel somewhat guilty. The
Colonel, on this occasion as self-appointed Master of the Ceremonies,

is all in his glory; and those ladies who have brought ball-dresses
are so grateful to him for giving them
a chance of wearing them, that the
next day a pettiopated deputation
formally thanks him on the roof—
everything takes place on the roof—
for his exertions on their behalf, and
he is thenceforward the most popular
man in the five hotels. Afterwards,
when, somehow or other, in the local
journal there appears an account of
the "soirée damante"—"exquise"—
"raritsante"—with a full description
of Madame ROSETTA'S charming cos-
tume, and so forth, the Colonel, who,
like the immortal Mr. Crummies,
"cannot imagine how these things get
into the papers," is radiant, and spends
his entire afternoon in sending copies
to his friends.
Cousin JANE and myself only literally
"look in" at this gay affair, which
begins at an hour that we religiously
consecrate to retiring to rest. "What
is the use," says Cousin JANE, very
sensibly, "of being here for health,
and then sitting up and going to par-
ties, and taking supper, just as if we
were in London for the Season P"
I quite agree with her. She is
absolutely right. "Besides,' I add, "I haven't brought any even-
ing dress with me."
And," says JANE, as she takes her candle, and opens her door.
"I haven't got anything I could go in. I wish I had. Good
night."
TRUE LIBERTY IN FRANCE.
IN the Times' Foreign Correspondence last Friday, we read :—
"M. de MOKTILLET, well known for hie researches on primitive man, and
Hadical Deputy of Seine-et-Oise, is one of the school of despotic Republicans.
AB mayor of St. Germain he has decreed that all the municipal official» shall
send their children to the municipal schools on pain of dismissal. He is so
convinced of the excellence of secular education, that he will not allow the
parents under hie rule the option of preferring Catholic schools. But what an
outer}- he would have raised had a Reactionary mayor required children to be
sent to the Catholic schools."
The French Socialistic Communist in supreme command is only a
despotic Louis THE FOURTEENTH masquerading in a Republican
blouse. Were the Rev. Mr. KERB and the Scottish Protestant
Alliance in hisdepartment, M. de MOKTILLET would exterminate the
lot of them, much as the Grand Monarque dragonnaded the Huguenots,
whose sole crime was their daring to hold an opinion different from
his own.
The active spirit of bigotry and fanaticism is exactly the same
everywhere¡ and in every age, whether the possessors of power be
Pagan, Papist, Protestant, Communist, Agnostic or Atheist.
And it is for such courtesies as these, forsooth, that LEO THE
THIRTEENTH bows so politely, and yields, or seems to yield, to French
arrogance in China. "It is like their cheek " to demand any con-
sideration from the POPE, and the latter would be keeping literally
to the Christian precept if he presented them with his own cheek, and
proceeded in China without considering such exemplary ' French
Christians as are represented by the narrow-minded bigot of the name
of MORTILLET. Through such friends as M. de MORTILLET the Re-
publican cause is "mortally" injured.
A REVELATION.—General BRINE—a name more suggestive of an
Old Salt than a military man—wrote from the Athenteum Club last
week to the Pall Mall Gazette, informing that journal that "with
his experience he could write columns "—as a General he is accus-
tomed to forming columns—" on the doings of the London police and
chuckers-out." Here 's a nice member of the respectable Athensoum
Club, the resting-place of the highest Ecclesiastics, Chancellors,
Judges, and the elderly professors of Science, Literature, and Art!
Ex uno disc« omnes. Are they all, in a general way, like General
BRINE? Is it possible that they are still such " sad pickles "?
AT the Théâtre Français, Hamlet, as translated by MM. 1 м м \>
and MEURICE, is announced as "to be given shortly,"—though
"shortly " is not exactly the expression, seeing that they intend doing
it with all the changes of scene, juntas SHAESPEARE wrote it. At least
so 'tis said; and so probably it is not true. Change of scene in sight
of the audience is a novelty for the Français. They should send for
AUGUSTUS DRURIOLANUS.

IN PREPARATION.
Iw anticipation of the conclusion of Her Majesty's year of jubilee,
already several festive and other celebrations to do honour to the
occasion are said to be in course of preparation. Among these the
following, to which rumour assigns a good authority, may be regarded
as the most authentic :—
Grand Dinner given by the Cabinet, at the Holborn Restaurant, to
the representatives of the Irish Dynamite Party, who will come over
from America, by special invitation, for the purpose of attending it.
Reconciliation Festival, at the South Kensington Station, between
the Chairman and Directors of the Metropolitan and District Rail-
ways respectively, to celebrate the permission to be given to intend-
ing passengers to book to any Station they please, without being torn
to pieces by the rival touters of each Company.
Inauguration of the proceedings of the Spending Departments'
Commission, during which the three Departments will, in a given
time, spend as much as they possibly can, amid the general rejoicing
of over-paid heads and superfluous subordinates.
Practical and experimental Fête given in honour of the Gun Ring
at Woolwich, in the course of which the Officials of the Ordnance
Board will plan, construct, turn out, and ultimately themselves fire
and blow up in their midst one of their own gnns with the usual
results.
Grand Highland Festival at Balmoral, in the course of which
Prince HENBY of Battenberg will make his first public appearance
in the kilt, go through a bit of the sword-dance, and play the treble
part of _" Scott who hae" on the bagpipes at a Gillies' bau.
Meeting to take into consideration, in the interests of the Licensed
Victuallers, the holding at South Kensington next year of an exhi-
bition of alcoholic products, to be called, under the presidency of
Mr. SOMERS VHTE, "The Drinkeries."
Scheme for starting a New Royal National and Popular Academy
at the Agricultural Hall, Islington, to which the admission, inclu-
ding omnibus fare and a catalogue, will be fourpence, and at which
Mr. H< > I.M л x HURT will take the money and umbrellas at the doors.
Publication by Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, on his return from the Conti-
nent, of a neat volume of his "impressions," which is to appear
under the title of Jottings by Joe, and be embellished by notes of a
friendly detective in five different languages, and dedicated to what
remains of the Liberal-Unionist Party.
Grand financial sacrificial monument on the part of the General
Omnibus and Road Car Companies, who simultaneously further
reduce their fares to anywhere, inside or out, to the uniform charge
of one halfpenny.
"WHEN THE STORMY WINDS DO BLOW."
THE published report of the recent visit paid by the Lords of the
Admiralty to Portsmouth, states that after starting in their Yacht
the Enchantress, from the Nore, (nasty place, by the way, to start
from), their Lordships encountered for the first four hours of the
voyage, "very rough weather," seas continually breaking over the
ship. Anybody who knows how disagreeable an experience of even two
hours between Dover and Calais may prove, will appreciate the
position of their Lordships, who, notwithstanding all their naval
E restige, must have turned into their berths in as wretched a plight
эг the nonce as the veriest landlubbers. Indeed that they suffered
severely the sequel clearly demonstrates, inasmuch as though a three
days' programme had been drawn up, it is stated that their "Lord-
ships intimated that, owing to the pressure of Parliamentary business,
it might be necessary for them to return suddenly to town," after
attending a local ball.
As no further orders were given to the Enchantress, which, what-
ever her capabilities to charm may be, appears to have entirely
failed in holding her Masters spell-bound, it is to be presumed that
their Lordships backed gracefully out of the proceedings, and got
quietly back to Westminster by rail as soon as possible. It is to be
noted that the only true salt among them, Lord CHABLES BEBESFORD,
was not of the party, which perhaps may account for the evident
readiness with which the sea-going portion of the programme was so
hastily, but decidedly, abandoned. It is to be presumed that by this
time the Enchantress has crept stealthily back to her moorings at
Gravesend.

SOMETHING LIKE A GOVERNMENT OEGAN.
WK understand that, encouraged by the appreciative welcome
extended to the Soard of Trade Journal^ the Government has it in
contemplation to embark on other journalistic enterprises. We have
been favoured with a sight of the (provisional) prospectus of an illus-
trated weekly, entitled 'D O W B"
A LITERARY AND PICTOBIAL CHRONICLE FOR THE SERVICES.
(Мотто—" Service is no Inheritance."—Popular Proverb.)
As befits its less austerely accurate objects, and its more romantic
range of subjects, Dowb will aim at a more popular, not to say sen-
sational, tone than suite the severely statistical columns of the
Soard of Trade Journal.
_Fiction—very bold Fiction—and Art—exceedingly subtle Art-
will lend their genial attractions to its pages.
A most exciting Romance, entitled
BUKST GUNS AND BENT BAYONETS;
Or, Hov> u-e Smashed Up the Brit'uh Empire,
will commence in the First Number. This thrilling story, teeming
with scenes of sensational horror, piteous pathos, roaring fun, and
rollicking rascality, will be the work of " Two Friends," one high in
official rank, the other a Colossus in the world of Contractors. It
will be founded on facts (which no Commission of Inquiry has yet
succeeded in eliciting), and will indeed partake of that autobiographic
character which lends such a charm of Le-Sage-like and /olacsque
realism to romantic narrative.
It will be copiously and poignantly illustrated by a new Artist,
who will be found to combine the wild invention of DORÉ, the grim
realism of CRTJIKSHANK, the dash of CATÓN WOODVTLEE, and the
delicacy of HORSLEY.
With the first number will be presented a truly agonisingly
impressive picture by this Artist, printed separately on plate paper,
40 in. x 25 in., and suitable for framing and for hanging in a
military gentleman's official sanctum or in a successful contractor's
sleeping apartment.
This startling design illustrates a salient incident in the story. It
is entitled :— « gOLD, BY 1!!"
It represents most realistically the death struggle and the indig-
nant _ agonising dying expression of a dashing young soldier,
first in the breach against tremendous odds, whose bayonet "buckles
up" against the thick linen swathing of a colossal savage whom he
is heroically charging, and whose rudely-shapen but razor-keen
blade buries itself ш the young hero's undefended brow.
It is confidently expected that this story and its illustrations will
create ¿ ОЛЕ AT SENSATION!!!
Other attractions will appear in early numbers, e.g. :— A series of
humorous Articles, entitled, "PERKS AND PERILS." the first of which,
"How I Gained— and Lost— my Carriage and Pair," by an ex-
Official, will be given in the second number of Dowb.
"The Mysterious Rouleaux: a Romance of the Red Tape Office."
By a Contractor's Confidential Clerk.
"The Missing Million, and what became of it; a Secret of the
Rule-of-Thumb Department." By an Accountant.
"Men who have Risen, and how they Rose." By "Еним
TENEATIS."
"In the Wrong Box; a Story of a Letter that went astray."
Nor will subjects of a more solid nature be neglected. A Treatise
on the properties and right application of Palm-Oil will excite much
interest in many quarters. The Art of Cutting Down and Up"
will be dealt with m detail by a competent hand. "On the Con-
struction and Conduct of Commissions of Inquiry " will prove an
eye-opener to many. "Extracts from the Diary of a Government
Inspector" (dates omitted, and names left blank) will prove extremely
piquant reading. A mock-heroic poem, "Adventures in Search of a
Clerical Error," facetiously illustrated, will run through the Muses'
Department of Dowb for some weeks to come.
Also ahighlyamusingsetof articles entitled, "Trials and Tests; or
Practical Jokes, and How to play them upon the Public with
impunity." These papers, strongly commended to the consideration
both of manufacturers and cynical humoriste, will be found at once
useful and mirth provoking.
Answers to Correspondents do not form a portion of the plan of this
Journal. The inquisitive and sceptical spirit so deplorably charac-
teristic of the age will be discouraged in every possible way by Dowb.
ASK FOR "pOWB."— The New Illustrated Official Oracle.
Published Every Friday. Price Sixpence I
The Projectors of Dowb evidently anticipate that it will attract
attention.
Mr. Punch has no doubt that it will do во. His eye at least will
be on it. He will, in fact, "take care of Dowb* in a fashion
peculiarly hie own.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
UTXACTBD FKO.M
THE DIARY. OF TOBY, M.P.
Haute of Commons, Monday, Sept. 13.—Very small attendance,
but those present pretty lively. Ministers mastered in large numbers.
Front Opposition Bench empty вате for occasional visit from JOHN
MOKLEY and MABJOBIBANKS. Dissentient Liberals mostly gone
away for holiday, in anticipation of difficulties that might arise
on I'AK.NK.LL'S lull. The Sage of Queen Anne's Gate remains at his
poet, looking after the pence. To-night, on Vote for Woods and
Foreste, passionately protests against £500a-year being paid for food
for pheasants in Windsor Park. With people wanting bread, that
seemed to the Sage somewhat anomalous. Greatest respect for
Prince CHRISTIAN, but didn't think that Nation should be called
upon to pay the expenses of his shooting. Much cheering from the
Radicals, and signs of pained emotion from Hon. Gentlemen opposite.
RANDOLPH endeavoured, with success, to preserve attitude of in-
difference. Time was !But times are changed.
From pheasants in Windsor Park the Sage proceeded to the dis-
cussion of Lion King-at-Arms, and his cost to the country. After
this, divers subjects discussed in varied mood. CONTBEABE'S appear-
ance towards midnight occasion for wild outburst. House evidently
won't have CONTBEABE on any terms. "We Connybeare him," the
Lord Advocate said; which shows to what depths he had been
moved.
Tuesday, 12'50 A.M.—Affaire come to a dead-lock. Irish Members
been talking all night. English Votes now reached. RANDOLPH,
who had been in his place throughout sitting, wearily proposes to
take them. Windbag SEXTON seizes opportunity of making another
speech in opposing Motion. CONTBEAHE moves to Report Progress.
Howls and groans. JOHN MOBLET comes to aid of Government.
RANDOLPH eloquently denounces Obstruction. DILLON reminds him
of former achievements of his own. RANDOLPH rages. Irish Mem-
bers rise one after another. JOSEPH GILLIS, in his new character of
the Great Conciliator, begs gentlemen to consider the recklessness of
taking important Votes at this hour.
2'5 A.M.—Committee divided on Motion to Report Progress. For
Erogress, 54 against 150. Over two hundred gentlemen up at this
our of the morning! Soon as they came back, J. O'CoNNOK moved
Chairman leave the Chair. For the Motion, 55; against, 154. Five
more gentlemen dug out of armchairs in recesses to come and vote.
2'30 A.M.—HUNTBK moved to Report Progress. RANDOLPH showing
signs of flagging! General GOLDSWOBTHT leapt into breach, declared
he was prepared to stop to any hour. Wild cheering from the
Ministerialista. Counter-cheers of defiance from the Irish Old
Guard.
TAT PAT rose to height of occasion. Flung back concession at the
craven feet of the titled leader of the House. War! war!! open
war!!! was what TAT PAT wanted.
"He calls for it," sneered HICKS-BEACH, "as if it were a pot of
beer, and the waiter were in the room."
TAT PAT'S magnificent attitude so excited CONTBEAEE that at
twenty minutes to Four in the morning he again appeared. Received
with burst of howls and yells. Above the tumult was heard shouting

that he"was "ready to sit not only for hours, but for weeks." That

going forward to-night. JOSEPH GILLIS as sober as a Judçe. Not a
twinkle in his eye, not a quiver on the firm line of his lips, as he
besought the belated Government to come to business. A. many-
sided man, JOSEPH. Found him later, sunk in deep meditation.
"Musing on the Barbavilla murder," I asked him, "or on the
riots at Belfast?"
"Neither. TOBT," said the philosopher. "I was thinking of
Woman, and how she is divided among the two political classes of
the day. All the single women are Liheral-Unionists, and many of
the married are Separatists."
I made a note of that, for JOSEPH, as everyone knows, is an
authority on Woman. House scrambled on till half-past Two in
the morning.
Business Done,—Few Votes in Supply.
Thursday.—House at meeting thrilled with news that GLADSTONE 's
coming back. Has been seen on the road making straight for West-
minster. RANDOLPH во depressed by the persistence of Obstruction

that'there is some talk of bis retiring from public life. He has
threatened this before, and I doubt whether he means it now. But
he certainly feels the situation acutely.
"If, TOBY," he said just now, " there is one thing in Parliamentary
warfare I can't abear, it's Obstruction. Go for the other side as
much as you like when occasion arises; but don't interfere with the
progress of public business. Motions for the Adjournment, talking
against time, and the rest, I cannot away with."
It must, truly, be hard.upon a sensitive mind to sit through such a
night as this has been. Business proposed, pass the Votes. Last
thing talked about, the Votes. PABNELL doesn't turn up. and it's
said doesn't approve the proceedings. This rupture in their own,
ranks adds last touch of delight to the proceedings. To obstruct
business and to bully Ministers when themselves united, is a very
stale joy for Irish Member of any experience. But to scratch RAN-
DOLPH'S face while kicking out behind at their own Leader is bliss
indeed. On the whole not an amusing business, after edge of joke
of RANDOLPH lecturing obstructionists has worn off. More like a
street row than the proceedings of a deliberative assembly.
Business done.—Several Votes agreed to.
Friday Morning.—Parnellites really did emit flash of humour at
early hour this morning. On Wednesday morning, English Educa-
tion Votes reached at One o'clock. RANDOLPH proposed to go on
with them. Irish Members objected. Blustered with indignation
at notion of taking important Votes at that hour. Intention accord-
ingly abandoned. This morning at 2'30 Votes reached again.
HICKS-BEACH observed at that late hour impossible to take Vote«.
Parnellites more shocked than ever. What! Leave the business of
the Nation at this early period of the sitting? Disgraceful! Let us
do our work, and think less of our personal comfort. Astonished
Ministers, fearing trap, went cautiously forward. But nothing hap-
pened except Votes were passed.
Mem. from RANDOLPH'S Note-book: How to
get Votes through Committee when Obstruction
rampant. At One o'clock rise and say yon are
fa£Ked' Committee wearied, hour late. Very
sorry, hut better adjourn. Then they insist, and
you give way with apparent unwillingness.
Business done.—Many Votes passed.
Saturday Morning,—Another late sit-
ting with one to follow this afternoon.
Votes of miscellaneous character, from
Queen's College to occupation of Egypt.
Interesting inquiry as to what DBUM-
MOND WOLFF is doing besides picnicing.
£5,000 a-year voted for him. Sage of
Queen Anne's Gate wants to know why?
So do GEOBGE CAMTBELL, JOHN DILLON,
and other persons of inquisitive mind.
FEBGUSSON answers in oracular manner.
"Wait a bit and you'11 see. WOLFF'S
advances secret, but sure. Hie picnics
only a foil. Something splendid happen
soon."
Minority incredulous, but opposition
hopeless, and Vote agreed to.
GEOBGE CAMPBELL on again about
the pictures in the National Gallery.
Insisted upon knowing who was "JOHN,
Duke of Bedford." Then there was the
VANDYCK, "a hideous repulsive picture
consisting chiefly of a horse—and such a
horse !" SIE GEOBGE added. Not reck-
oned an eloquent man, but the expression of his face, when he made
this remark nearly carried a majority against the Vote.
Business done.—Supply.

"And such a Horse!"
Tip to the English Team for Australia.
GOOD-BYE, and good luck! You don't travel to talk
Like the rambling political pump;
But we hope all the same, Sirs, that in your own walk
You may often be found " On the Stump."

COLINDERIES
THE 'COLINDERIES" IN EX-CHELSEA-IS.
As an early answer
to the PRINCE'S re-
cent letter to the
LORD MAYOR, pro-
posing the establish-
ment of an " Impe-
rial Institute," Mr.
Punch has received
the subjoined scheme
anonymously from
an ' ' organising Com-
mittee," who have
evidently taken the
matter practically in
hand on the lines
they imagined indi-
cated in His Royal
Highness's mani-
festo. Mr. Punch
has much pleasure
in publishing it for
the benefit of all
those who are inte-
rested in the now
apparently perennial
progress of popular
recreative Science
and Art in the neigh-
bourhood of South
Kensington, and he
respectfully suggests
that Sir CUNLIFFE
OWEN should lose no
time in submitting
the matter to the
РКШСЕ himself. It'is as follows. Under the official style and title of
THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE OF GREAT BRITAIN, INDIA,
AND THE COLONIES,
the Organising Committee beg to inform their patrons the plea-
sure-seeking, theatre-going, and general Public, that they nave
made arrangements, on and after the first day of January next, to
open the whole of the popular Exhibition, now known as the " Colin-
deries," as a
Rehabilitated and Improved. Cremorne Gardens,
Judiciously combining all the noted attractions of that famous resort
with
THE AUTISTIC SIDE or BRITISH, INDIAN, AND COLONIAL LIFE.
Among the conspicuous features of the new undertaking will be
A PERMANENT MAYPOLE,
Round which Visitors will be invited to dance to their hearts' content
from early morn to dewy eve, to the strains of
THE COMMITTEE'S BAND OF 130 PERFORMERS,
While, after dark, they will be enabled, on the
COLOSSAL ILLUMINATED DANCING PLATFORM,
to revive the best traditions of the famous Chelsea resort by joining
in the mazes of the giddy waltz, to the strains of STRAUSS or WALD-
TEUFEL, till the small hours of the morning.
The good old traditions in the way of attraction in the shape of
10,000 Additional Coloured Lamps
will be kept steadily in view by the Committee, and great improve-
ments will be effected in Old London, the upper storeys of the nouses
of which will be utilised as
SELECT SUPPER ROOMS,
while beneath, in the vicinity of the Church tower, in a secluded spot,
A HERMIT'S CELL
will be established in which a distinguished С. В. will be seated,
and always accessible for consultation tor a small extra fee.
In the grounds, in addition to the establishment of revolving
swings, roundabouts, nut-shooting booths, and gilt ginger-bread
stalls, by which the Committee hope to infuse into the undertaking
some of the spirit characteristic of
OLD GREENWICH FAIR
there will be inaugurated, on a permanent footing, with all its cele-
brated attractions,
A REVISED AND REMODELLED RICHARDSON'S SHOW,
VOL, ХСГ.
on the Stage of which it is computed, that, owing to the counter-
attractions of the Gardens emptying their own theatres,
THE LEADING LONDON COMPANIES
will only be too happy to appear for any number of nights they can
conveniently secure.
The famous Indian Jungle and the Stuffed Animals in the present
Exhibition will be dispensed with, and their place taken by
AN EXTENSIVE MENAGERIE,
the leading animals of which will be fed, if possible, every half-hour
for the benefit of visitors from 10 A.M. to 10 P.M., while highly-
trained Elephants will go through their
MARVELLOUS AND UNIQUE PERFORMANCES,
indicative of the effects of Western Civilisation on the cultivated
intelligence of the East, in a Circus specially arranged for the
purpose.
With a view to meeting the expressed wishes of a certain number
of Colonists, arrangements will be made by which Colonial and other
Wines will be able
To BE DRUNK FREELY IN TUMBLERS ALL OVEE THE GROUNDS,
at Stalls that will be specially indicated, at all hours.
The Committee further propose to close the Exhibition at 2 A.M.
(except on Special and Reserved Gala Days, when no one will he
turned out before half-past five the next morning) with a
GIGANTIC DISPLAY OF FIREWORKS,
if not interfered with by the action of the various Insurance Compa-
nies interested in the security of the neighbouring property. A
striking feature of these displays will be the letting off of a Colossal
Set-Piece, giving expression to some event or subject connected with
the undertaking; and it is proposed that the one selected for the
opening day shall portray
H.R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES INSPECTING THETBALANCE-SHEET
in the presence of the Subscribers and general well-wishers of the
concern, as suitable to the occasion.
It is understood that on the scheme being established on a sure and
satisfactory footing, with a view to the convenience oí the local con-
stables no less than that of the general public, application will be made
to the Authorities for the erection of a new Police Court, where
night-charges will be able to be taken on the spot, probably close to
the South Kensington Station, in the immediate neighbourhood of
the Exhibition.

HAPPY THOUGHT.
HOW TO EQUALISE THE ODDS!
GONE!
[It was announced that Mr. GOLDTVIX SMITH would sail from
Liverpool on the 25th September, to resume his professorial
duties at tho Toronto University.]
WHAT! GOLD-WIN SMITH going back to Toronto?
Why can we not weep burning tears when we want to?
What sage can be substitute, equal, successor
To dead and gone BENJAMIN'S own pet Professor?
Who, like our own GOLDWIN base GLADSTONE will slate.
Give Ireland what for, and put Parliament straight?
To kick up a dost is his duty one feels,
And not lo go shaking pur dust from his heels.
How shall we get on without sapient GoLDwnr
To tell us how Britons who bounce and are bold win P
Poor England must lose half her power and pith
Deprived of the sledge-hammer strength of her SMITH.
TIME AND TIDY.
DR. TIDY, of Islington, is troubled to know where our
posterity are to find standing room. He calculates that
if we go on multiplying at the present rate, in seven
generations the population of the United Kingdom will
exceed that of the entire world as it now is, while in
twenty generations we shall want about twenty planeta of
the size of this earth, all to ourselves, to have anything
like elbow-room. Pooh! Dr. TIDY bases all this bad
dream of " mournful numbers " upon an " if," unmindful
of MALTHUS, DARWIN, and the Mahatmas, of the possi-
bilities of scientific advance and human development,
of the equally substantial "ifs" of aerial navigation,
lévitation, astral bodies, wings, collapsible skeletons,
eometary impacts, and a whole heap of other speculative
contingencies. Twenty generations means a tidy time,
Dr. TIDY. Cheer up, and let the Coming Race clear ite
own course.
QUESTION то BE ASKED NEXT SESSION,—In consequence
of some irregularities in the Postal service between
England and the Continent, to inquire why in future the

EGBERT ON EOYALTY.
WE are a cumming into each strange times as praps the werry
boldest on us has never witnessed or ewen dreamt on, and that the
werry boldest on us looks on with fear and tremblin. Without more
than jest eluding to such matters as hapenny cups of tea or coffee to be
had in Cheepside, think of Dinners made of all Wegetabels, and with-
out not no meat, nor no fish, nor no poletry, and nothink to drink
but cold water! Dinners indeed! Wot a fine spessimen of a Man a
pore creature must grow into who lives upon nothink but wegetabele
and water. Why, we might jest as well be horses, or ewen wues!
And then to think that ewen Parlyment shood go in for cheap
dinners, and draw the line at 2s. a-head. including the Waiter, and
yet expect to retane the respec of their fellow man.
But a trewse to such sad thorts, and let me come to the pint from
which I has sumwhat strayed.
Well, then, with all that profound respek for the Rite Honnerabel
the LOBD MARE, which my persition and my loyalty naterally calls
fourth, I must wenture werry umbly, but werry fosserbly, to remon-
strate with his Lndship, for allowing1 one of the Royal Kings of
Urope to wisit the Manshun House of Horsepitality and to leave that
Hying cymbal of the werry hieet of Cristian wirtues, without no
Dinner! To be sure the Lunshon was about as perfek as a Lunshon
can well be, and what with the queenly Lady Mareas, and the too
charming Sherriffesses, and the graceful Lady Ems, no dowt his
Royal Madjesty of Portogall managed to injoy hisself, but still, after
all, disguise it as you will, a Lunshon is ony a Lunshon, and no more
to be compared to a reel Manshun House Dinner, than a pint of
Bitter is to a Bottle of Old Port.
There ain't so many Kings left us ш we can afford to lose a chance
of dining one when he gives it us. France ain't got no King, Swiz-
zerland ain't cot no King, and Ameriky ain't got no King, tho from
what I hears it's suttenly quite big enuff for one, and tho Roosia
has got one, he don't seem to be a werry cumferal one, speshally wen
he 's a trawelling in his own loyal country, surrounded by his own
loving subjeks, with jest about 20,000 sojers a travelling with him to
see as they ain't too affeokshunate, so he ain't werry likely to cum
here jest now, and tho Germenny has got a King he 's much too old
to go out a wisiting. Then Spane's little King is only about six
munths old, so we needn't expect him jest yet awhile. Belgium
and Grease we 've had, and a werry fine cupple of Kings they was,
and both werry liberal in sutten matters as shall be nameless. The
pore King of HOLLANDS got as far on his way to Gildhall as Buck-
ingham Pallis, but then had to go suddenly home again, tho his
dinner was got all ready for him, for a greater King than even
Hollands had bin busy in his absence. So there ain't above three or
four left, and reelly it 's amost absurd for to menshun Sweden and
Denmark, they are such werry little uns. Such being the case, it
behoves the King of the Citty of London to feast his brother Potten-
tates rite royally, wenever he gits a chance, for I werry much fears
as their number is more like to git littler than to git bigger!
l offen, wen l'm a lissening to the grand spessimens of burning
loyalty as I hears so frequent after dinner, wundere how peeple manages
to get on in countries where there isn't not no Kings or Queens, or
Princes or Princesses. Wot must be the fust two Toastes in them
beknighted Lands, and how can they possibly drink their wine with-
out the Nashonal Anthem P BROWW tells me, but it isn't necessarilly
trew, that in Amerikey they aint got no such things as Dooks, and
Markisses, and Wioounts, and Erie, no, not ewen no Barren Lords!
and that yet they manages to get along pretty oumferal. But then,
he says, as they ain't never had none, they carn't know what they 've
lost in consequence, jest the same as a pore devel of a working man
doesn't know what he has lost by never having no fine old Port wine,
beooz he 's not never tasted none.
Ah, it 's becumming rayther a rum world, and sum of our most
cherisht ideare and most saoredest principals is a being atacked in a
way as shakes 'em to their werry old fpwndations. Take for
hinstanee the sacred rites of Propperty- I ain't got none myself, so I
speaks as the Loryers says, without no prejewdies. Formerly wen
a pore little Farmer couldn't pay his rent, his kind Landlord sold him
up and then turned him out, and there an end. But now, the un-
reesonable creechers acshally objeks to this time-onered system, and
want« laws to be made that shall egsouse them paying part of their
rent if they haven't made no money by their farms, and so hasn't got
none to pay with! Ah, it 's all the fault of wot 's called eddicashun.
the werry fust effect of which is, as I always crofesside as it would
be, to make all werry poor peeple dissatisfide with their persition, and
acshally want to better theirselves, and they don't werry much care
at whose xpense. ROBERT.

FAREWELL, Mr. SPEAKER! The Session,

Your joy must be past all expression,

This is hardly the place for a jig, Sir,
Or else—I'll admit to your face—

To keep down my larkier self.

And hoped—I enjoy their chagrin—

[OCTOBER 2, 1886.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A WATER COURSE.
vin.
Equestrian Exercise—My First Side on Unfaire.
REMEMBERING that the Colonel was in full equestrian costume on
the day of our arrival, I ask him if the riding is good about here.
"Eh?" he exclaims, putting his hand heartily on ray shoulder,
"Eh, dear boy, you ride? We will go together. The country is
superb. I will take you. To-morrow? Soit: good. I will order
the horses of M. DETACHÍ. Two, good, dear boy, not much to look.
but to go—eh—first rate, all
right, dear boy! I will order
Risette for me, and Hunter—
they pronounce him Untaire—
for you. I '11 take ter tickets
of M. DETACHE, and you can
buy them of me—joost what
you want."
As I do not quite seize the
S'an, he explains to me that
. DÉTACHÉ's method is to
sell во many tickets at eight
francs a-piece, representing
First Appearance of Untaire. ^ man„ ri¿eSj an¿ you return
a ticket after each ride. I see: perfectly. I take two tickets for
Untaire, as if he were an entertainment.
In the afternoon they arrive. No, they are not much to look at.
Risette is the better in appearance, a bay of about fifteen hands, and
Hunter, or " Untaire," is about fourteen one, with a weary expres-
sion in his eye, a drooping head, an ^unkempt dirty mane hanging
raggedly about a neck so curiously indented as to suggest the idea
of his having been, at one time or other, decapitated and imper-
fectly refitted. His bones are everywhere visible; he is rather down
in his shoulders, as apparently he is on
his luck, but his hind-quarters are pecu-
liarly strong. His feet are broad, and
his legs certainly warrant his owner's
description of him.
"Iteet bien solide," says M. DÉTACHÉ,
the proud proprietor of Untaire.
So on the solid Untaire I mount. Until
I am on his back I am convinced that
Untaire is fast asleep. He wakes up
however on his girths being tightened,
and looks round with a shrug of his thin
shoulders, as much as to say. "Hallo!
Another two hours! Ah well! Risette's
going, so that's company at all events."
By the way, this affection for Risette is
most remarkable. Untaire at first refuses
to turn round to the left in order to go
out of the gate, because the movement
involves losing sight of Risette for an
instant. I am determined that the affec-
tionate Untaire shall go the way I want
him. He sulkily yields to a sharp touch
of the spur and a tug of the left rein, т> pretor of Untaire.
and, catching sight oí Risette's tail, he
decides that for once my way shall be his, and consequently comes
round to my way of thinking.
From this experience of Untaire I draw two conclusions; first,
that the characteristic of his temper is obstinacy; secondly, that he
possesses a mouth about as impressionable as a flint wall.
My stirrups, which are small and slight, strike me as having been
originally made for a rocking-horse: so do the reins. The saddle,
also made for a rocking-horse, is fairly comfortable. We are starting
at half-past three, and the heat is tropical. I am waging a con-
tinuous war against the persistent horse-flies that fasten on to the
solid Untaire like so many leeches. Any other horse would have
been driven mad long ago, but Untaire seems accustomed to it.
Sometimes he shakes his head as if gently remonstrating and saying
to some flies more pertinacious than the rest, "Oh, really now this
is too bad I You might leave me alone, some of you!"
The high roads are hard as granite, with a soft powdery dust on
each side. The short cuts, originally used only by pedestrians, but
which the Colonel, as guide, selects in order to show his thorough
knowledge of the country, are rocky, stony, and uneven, having been
formed during many winters by the mountain torrents.
"Look here, dear boy," says the Colonel, with all the enthusiasm
of an explorer, or an Indian Pathfinder, "you follow me. I find a
lovely road. We must ride pretty quick at first, because it is all
up-hill, but, after, it is all down, and we shall have to walk much.
Allons! Tchk!" and, without waiting for a reply, he dashes off up
the road, and is suddenly lost to sight round a sharp corner.
I follow at the same pace: that is when 1 say I follow at the same

pace, I mean that Untaire does. For, immediately Untaire sees
Risette go off at a gallop, he pulls himself together and starts after
her at such a pace, and in so blind and reckless a manner, that I am
brought within measurable distance of a collision with a bullook-
cart which is advancing towards us, and then, after scattering a
crowd of terrified pedestrians, and so startling an old gentleman,
who is reading, that he clasps the book to his breast and makes pre-
cipitately for a heap of stones, Untaire skirts an open drain and
dashes round the corner where the Colonel has just disappeared.
Then catching sight of Risette in the distance, where I can just see
the upper ЬаЙ of the Colonel—above a low wall—careering at full
gallop, Untaire redoubles all his energies to come up with Risette.
Heavens! What a ride! Rocks, actual boulders, sticking up in
the middle of what they call a road—loose stones as big as your head
—ruts—gutters—I shall pull up,—that is, if I can. Hi I Stop!"
I shout to the Colonel. Let 's go quietly over this nasty bit"
No use my shouting, he is half a milo off, aid if I lose sight of him
I shall have to go back
again, that is, if Untaire
will consent to return, and
give up my ride. Untaire
hasn't fallen on his nose yet
—perhaps he is accustomed
to rocks, and knows how to
get over them without fall-
ing ... it 's up-hill, that 's
one good thing, and it 's no
use pulling at him, I might
as well tug at a milestone.
. . . Now between two
vineyards and a mountain-
side covered with pine-trees
on my left—I wish the
Colonel would stop to admire
the view, instead of gallop-
ing on at this Headless
Horseman sort of pace—
hah! a big rock in front of
us—and the end of the
road? — no — it's a high
bank and a sharp turning
to the right — I pull
Untaire's left with all my
might to steer him well
away from the wall—I just
manage it—we are round
it sideways like Mr. BATTY, at full speed on his bare-backed steed
in the Circus, and on we go again. Mazeppa isn't in it with me,
mounted on Untaire the wild horse of Royat. Up a mountain. . . .
At the top. . . . Colonel already nearly half-way down on the other
side. . . . More rocks, more stones, more boulders—and then a
small mountain-stream and two roads. Here the Colonel has pulled
up—thank Heaven !—and is considering which way he '11 take.
When I have recovered my breath sufficiently to make an obser-
vation, I say, sarcastically, "This is a nice sort of a country."
"Isn't it?" returns the Colonel delighted at my approval, and in
the highest possible spirits. "We must get to Charrade—that's at
the top somewhere—and then on to a place called Bouzy, or something
like that. This road," he says, pointing to a narrow walk which can
only by the utmost courtesy be even called a bridle-path, "leads up
to the pine-forest, but," he adds, indicating another on the right, "I
fancy from what I recollect of the route—that this is the shortest."
"It looks Imore likely," I reply, by which I mean that, for my
own personal comfort on Untaire, it seems to be less rocky and about
two inches wider.
"All right!" cries the Colonel, "Ноир-là!" and he is off again,
up rocky mountain-path at full gallop. In another second, so am
I, that is, so is Untaire. I can't be left behind and lost in a pine-
forest on the mountains, so I give Untaire his head,—this is merely
a matter of form as far as Untaire is concerned,—and away we
go. In less than five minutes I have ascended half a mile, nave
gone breathlessly round some sharp angles, fought with stiff bushes,
avoided whacks on the head from sturdy branches by lying along
Untaire's neck, and am at last thoroughly rejoiced to see the Colonel

The situation is magnificent: a perfect aisle of stately pine-trees
on each hand—hut the road is on the side of the mountain, and if
Untaire doesn't overcome his partiality for leaning to the right, down

marble is knocked from pin to pin—only this would be from pine to
pine—at Chinese billiards, or in the old race game. But I don't want
to play at any game of this sort, so am glad we are going quietly.
I come up with the Colonel and nope, by engaging him in conversa-
tion, to keep him walking at his present easy pace.
"Is this the right road for Charrade?" I ask.
"Yes! This is right I This is good going here! Whoop !" and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
before I can utter another word away he gallops, Untaire, breathing
hard, but game to the last, after him. I wish to goodness that
Untaire would not show such a decided predilection for leaning side-
ways, even when galloping, to the right. Either my knee will be
severely injured by a tree, or with the slightest additional bias to
the right down we go among the pines, and there 's an end of one of
us at all events, for I don't suppose that anything short of a sheer
fall of a hundred feet on to sharp rocks would affect Untaire. I try
to remember all the stories I 've ever heard about slipping your foot
out of the stirrup in time and throwing yourself off, and I only hope
the occasion won't arise which will compel my attempting any of
these wild-horse-of-the-prairie feats.
Light at last! .... End of the pine-forest—we are going always
at a gallop, along a rocky road—and are approaching a litue bit of
open heath—we cross it^—Untaire slithers (he is not so good on turf,
as he is on rocks) but with his gaze fixed on Risette, he follows her
without caring much where he puts his feet,—over the turf, more
Blithering,—down an incline of slippery grass, where we are prevented
from oominc down by a welcome bit of rock, which, in the ordinary
course of things, would have damaged any civilised horses, whether
in London or Leicestershire, for life,—and at last we are on a com-
paratively good road, where on a post is written "Charrade," and
an arrow indicates the direction.
"What a view !" the Colonel calls out, pointing towards the plain
below us—and the mountains far far away. We see towns spread
out like toys with red-roofed houses—old church towers—those
of Clermont-Ferrand Cathedral, standing out in the clear atmo-
sphere—it is evidently a baking day in the valley,—and here we are
being refreshed after our exertions by the most lovely air that comes
to us over refrigerating mountain-streams, and filtered through the
scented pines. Yes, tne view alone is worth something,—and for
the present the danger is forgotten.
"Ah," cries the Colonel, " when my wife drive up here and back,
she take two hours to come and one to return. The guide-book say
eet is an affair of three hours, and here we are up to the top at
Charrade in tirty-five minutes, and I do not know which way we
come. I had forgot." And he beams upon me as if conscious of
haying done something extraordinarily clever. "We will write a
guide-book for horseback. Now—allons !—eet ees all new to me."
A chill wind has arisen: I draw his attention to a black cloud
obscuring the observatory on the Puy-de-Dôme.
"It will be nutting," he says, setting off at a trot along the road,
whereupon Untaire sets off too at the same pace, but before we have
gone half a mile heavy drops begin to fall, and we take refuge
amonjç some bushes and young oak-trees.
I dismount. We are in a sort of natural arbour. Untaire exhibits
a remarkable liking for acorns. What other animal is devoted to
acorns? The pig. Has Untaire in the course of ages been evolved
from an antediluvian pig? If so, that accounts for the obstinacy
he displays under an assumed affection for Risette. The Colonel
feeling inaction for five minutes somewhat irksome, observes that in
this part of the world the storms are partial and local. I reply
that I would rather they did not show a partiality for us. I have not
taken an eight-franc ticket for Untaire in order to sit under a bush,
while Untaire stuffs himself with acorns. The Colonel volunteers to
reconnoitre. "Often it happens," he explains, "that while it is
pouring just over your head, it is quite dry and fine a hundred yard
further on." He will ride out and see: and he does so.
Untaire, intent on his acorn treat, does not notice the departure of
Risette. After ten minutes or more,
there being no signs of the Colonel's
return, I determine to come out of
my ambush and ride after him. This
decision involves the sum-
mary interruption of Un-
taire's feast, and he reluc-
tantly tears himself away
, / from a young oak-tree, with
/ his month full of green sprigs,
'ify. which he suffers me to re-
move. I mount, and urge
him into the open road. It

and sidles in a foolish sort of manner towards the right. I spur
him with my right he«l: I catch him a nasty one with my whip on
the right shoulder: all to no purpose, the more I spur, and the more
I whip, the more blunderingly and foolishly—it is a really foolish
and crab-like movement—he sidles towards the edge of the road.
The acorns must have got into his head. I never met with such an

undecided.
idiotic animal. As to his taking any notice of my tugging at the left
rein, I might as well pull at a broken door-bell and expect an answer.
He is curving his body, and moving sideways towards the edge of
the road, which being entirely unprotected by hedge or fence, dis-
covers a precipice below. A precipice, — simply a precipice. Untaire's
piggish obstinacy will be his destruction and mine. 1 make one last
desperate effort with whip and spur, to which Untaire only responds
by intensifying his imitation of a crab. There 's only one thing to
be done — if Untaire is determined on
suicide, he can go over by himself. I roll
off somehow, and alight on my back,
expecting to see the last of Untaire as he
disappears into the abyss beneath. No-
thing of the sort. Untaire pauses,
his purpose is shaken, — so am I
by the way, considerably; — just
at this minute the sound of hoofs ,
is heard, and the Colonel on l
Risette comes galloping back.
Immediately a better spirit takes
possession of Untaire. He con-
sents to be led into the middle of
the road, where he stands quiet as
a lamb, and looking so gentle that
you would think a child might
guide him.
"It is lucky you were off," says
the Colonel. "You are not 'urt! No? Good. Then come along!
Ter rain is over. I have a short cut." And away he goes at a
gallop down the road, then turns a corner and disappears. He is
always turning corners and disappearing. I am compelled to follow.
But my nerve is shaken, which, by the way, is a matter of not the
slightest consideration to Untaire, who now seems to have made up
his mind never again to lose eight of Risette. It is all down-hill.
The path comes abruptly to an end at a meadow.
"Come along!" cries the Colonel, waving his whip as if it were
a sword with which he were leading a charge of cavalry, and then
he urges Risette down a steep mossy slope, which will lead us into a
morass — I feel it will — where we shall stick in the mud, the horses
wül be up to their knees, and then what on earth shall we do?
Besides it suddenly occurs to me, aren't we trespassing? And in a
foreign country, too! Untaire slithers; he is not good on moss and
damp meadow land. This place — this short cut the Colonel has
chosen— is about as steep as the Devil's Dyke. Every minute I
expect we shall roll over. Still, as the Colonel and Risette are now
at the bottom of the meadow, Untaire and myself may be able to
arrive there also. We should arrive there with sufficient rapidity
if Untaire made one false step. Luckily he doesn't, and once
landed on something like terra firma, I breathe again.
'' There 's the road home!" shouts the Colonel, pointing to a road
up in the hills far above us, and more than a mile off, across fields
and apparently through plantations where I am sure we have no
right to ride. However we can't return; we must advance, and we
must go together, or one of us will be lost, and that will be myself.
Hallo! Exactly what I had feared. A peasant, with a fierce dog,
halloaing to us. Another peasant: more signalling and halloa-
ing. They are running. We are galloping. The Colonel is making
more cavalry charges, and waving his whip above his head frantically.
We fly across a meadow. We hear shouts behind us. Before us
is a running brook, rocky banks, and boulders. Can we jump it?
The Colonel is off in a second. He takes Risette by the bridle, and
jumps from rock to rock. I give Risette one sharp cut and she
bounds over the brook like a stag, knocking down the Colonel. He
is up again, quite pleased, and entirely unhurt. I adopt the same
plan, without allowing Untaire a second for reflection, and he follows
Risette, landing safely on the opposite rock. We mount and away,
like a couple of Dick Turpins. Peasants and dogs in field halloaing:
we ride full gallop up the next field. Peasants stopped by brook:
perhaps the next field, where we are, isn't their property. Colonel
sees a bank topped by a thick hedge. He gesticulates to me, indi-
cating that that is our short cut to the road and safety. We charge
it, take it with a muh, and pull up desperately on the edge of a pre-
cipitous drop. No help for it; we have to dismount and climb down
on foot the same way we came up; peasants below running round
to circumvent us, dogs barking savagely. Luckily the Colonel strikes
the right path, Risette breasts it gallantly; Untaire's powers are
failing. He breathes hard, he blows, he heaves up and down . . .
Now then, my gallant steed! think of Black Bess! only ten yards
more of perpendicular rock, and we are saved !— Come up! He
comes up — he makes a grand effort . . . and at last — we are safe and
sound on the homeward road. We trot on quickly; the peasants and
dogs are lost to view. "Colonel," I say, "¡let us ride the rest of the
way quietly." For once the Colonel acquiesces, and it is only at the
last, down-hill into Roy at, that he cannot resist breaking into a canter.
"We wül have another ride," he says, as we dismount. "Eet was
first-rate. And I think I know a better road still." We shall see.

NEW YOBK, Sept. 20.—TOMKINS, the man who recently accom-
plished the feat of going over Niagara in a hip-bath, is not, as has
been erroneously stated by one of your Contemporaries, a Cooper by
trade. In reality he is an unsuccessful Author, chiefly on theological
and political topics. Latterly, having come down in the world, he
has taken to writing sensational novelettes. In the course of an
interview which he yesterday granted to a Reporter of the Chicago
Firebrand, which styles him '' The Hero of Niagara," he stated that
he had for years past been trying to bring his name prominently
into notice. He had at different times proposed wildly impossible
political reforms, advocated gigantic trade swindles, and denounced
the private character of moat of the leading men in the country,
especially preachers. With the same object in view he had written
a disgracefully blood-curdling " thriller," containing fifteen forgeries
and twenty-six mysterious assassinations, which had been described
by the critics as " dull, and wanting in incident." He found that
nothing had succeeded half as well as going over Niagara in a tub
he had borrowed for the purpose. To write a sensational story took
several weeks, whereas shooting Niagara only occupied a few seconds.
He had, so far, netted 15,000 dollars by the transaction. In his
opinion the Government ought to prevent any foolhardy persons
trying to " cut him out," by emulating his exploit.
NIAGARA.—A Correspondent telegraphs, "Fifteen raving maniacs
have just arrived here, stimulated by TOMKINS'S recent success in
shooting the cataract. Each of them has a different plan for going
over the waterfall, and a good deal of money is being laid on the
chances of any of them surviving. One is cased from head to foot
in armour-plating, lined with india-rubber, and with thick belts of
cork fastened outside. The Authorities show some signs of substitu-
ting a strait-waistcoat for this costume, but the madman's backers
are very enthusiastic, and threaten to lynch anybody who interferes
with the experiment being tried."
Later.—From our Special Correspondent at the Fallt :—" It was
generally thought that after the shocking deaths of the fifteen maniacs
nobody would be rash enough to court almost certain destruction by
an attempt to navigate the Niagara Falls or Rapids. A young man
from Philadelphia, however, named JENKINSON, yesterday appeared
on the scene, and declared his intention of doing the Rapids, seated
on an ordinary sixteen-gallon beer-cask. The event eame off this
morning, in the presence of an immense concourse, most of whom
were brought in special excursion trains to the Falls. The banks of
the river were lined with picnicking sight-seers, and the scene was a
very gay one. JENKINSON'S young wife and four children hung
round nis neck, and implored him not to risk death; but they were
removed by the police, as their cries proved annoying to the large
and good-humoured crowd. At twelve o'clock a start was effected,
and all was well till the whirlpool was reached. At this point the
man was seen to throw his arms wildly into the air, and disappear
under the boiling waters. Much disgust was experienced by those
who had liberally backed him, and angry cries of "Swindler! were
heard. When the body was got out, half a mile lower down, by
means of grappling irons and a pitchfork, spirited attempts at resus-
citation were set on foot by those desirous of seeing a second attempt
made; but as the unfortunate man's back and neck were broken, as
well as most of his ribs, and there was no sign of returning respira-
tion, the efforts had to be abandoned. A subscription made ai'ter-
wards for the widow and children realised six dollars. If successful,
JENKINSON would have won ten thousand dollars. It is hoped (by
the hotel-keepers of the neighbourhood) that another attempt will be
made before long.
AN OLD FRIEND WITH A NEW NAME.
WHAT 's in a name? Well, the question sounds pithy,
But if yon would know, go and ask Bullock-Smithy
(A name Mr. Punch's old readers remember),
'Tie just fifty years, come this very September,
(See Echo of fetockport) that handsomer fame
Bullock-Smithy aimed at in complete change of name.
The new name, Hazel-Grove, it were hard to improve;
'Tie suggestive of filberts and pastoral love,
In place of bucolieal boorishness, once
The stamp of that home of the clown and the dunce.
Its Jubilee now Hazel-Grove means to hold.
Mr. Punch drinks success to the enterprise bold;
And, whether in mental or physical tillage,
He wishes good luck to the Lads of the Village.

Friday.—Arrived in England. Think I shall stay a fortnight. Managed to
escape the Mayor on landing—nearly! Came up to London where I was received
by a young gentleman, who told me that he represented hie Father, his Grand-
mother, hie tíñeles, his Cousins and his Aunts. Amiable youth, but seemingly
rather impatient to get away. He saw me into the back rooms of Buckingham
Palace and.bade me farewell. Rather tired after my journey. Rested. Strange
kind of place. Yery bored. Puzzled at a tune I heard once or twice when I came
across a military band.
Saturday.—Went _ont for a walk. Nice day, but nothing doing. Smoked
cigarettes with my Minister. Took a stroll in the garden and found myself over-
looked by people with telescopes. Received hearty welcome from the Entire Royal
Family—by telegraph. Asked for the statue of the first Marquis DOTTHO, but
found that it had been carted off to Aldershot. Went to a Theatre in the
evening. Bored. I think I shan't stay longer than thirteen days. Again
heard the mysterious tune—what is it?
Sunday.—Dull place London. My Minister came to smoke cigarettes. Read
me the Observer. Felt a little out of it. My Minister told me that Sunday was
always considered rather triste—even by Londoners. Went to the '' Colinderies."
No one there. All the "niggers" had gone on an excursion to Claremont. Wished
I had been asked too. Very bored. My Minister suggested the "Zoo." Rather
amused with the monkeys. Shall get back to Lisbon in twelve days. Can't
stand London any longer. Again heard that bothering tune—it was played by a
band while I was dining. Seems familiar to me. and yet I can't recall it
Monday.—Went to see some of the " sights." Bored out of my life. Can't
possibly stay more than ten days. Buckingham Palace very dull. Wish they
had offered me the Albert Palace instead. My Minister (who dropped in to smoke
cigarettes) tells me it is not half bad. Went to a Theatre where I again Jieard
the air. No, I can't remember it.
Tuesday.—Another turn at the "sights." I shall go melancholy mad if I
stay in this place much longer. Made up my mind I must get away by Satur-
day. Passed the time in the morning in dictating letters to my Minister refusing
to be photographed by four hundred photographers, and to take shares in four
thousand new Companies. Went over Buckingham Palace
and consider it a hole. Not surprised no one will live in
it. Smoked cigarettes with D'ASTAS. Guarda' Band
passed playing that puzzling tune. Where have I heard
it?
Wedneiday,—LORD MAYOR asked me to lunch. Very
civil indeed. Awfully pleased. Really hospitable. Very
good of him. Went to the City, and proposed his health,
coupled with the names of the Lady Mayoress and Queen
VICTORIA. Afterwards read him my translation of Ham-
let bv SHA KHPF.AKK. LORD MAYOR said it was " very
nice." Good fellow the LORD МАТОВ! Offered to reoite
to him my translation of other works by the same Author.
Unfortunately, he had an appointment, so took my
Minister back to Buckingham Palace, and recited them
to him. He wanted to go away at eleven, but got him to
stay on by presenting him, every time he grew restive,
with additional décorations. At intervals the band in
attendance played that extraordinary melody. Altogether,
a good day. Still this place is dull to a degree. Might
he bearable if I had been put up at the Mansion House.
Have insisted upon going home to-morrow. Really won't
pass another twenty-four hours in London.
Thurtday. — Started! Hooray! Left Buckingham
Palace accompanied by "travelling escort" of Horse
Guards. No one to see me off at the Waterloo Station,
not even the amiable young gentleman who met me on
my arrival. Never mind; so long as I got away what
did it matter? My carriage was tacked on to an ordi-
nary train. Caught by the Mayor at Devonport, who
would read me an address. Then he introduced me to
another Mayor. Never mind; asked them to dinner!
Ha! ha! They little knew what a revenge I had in
store for them I Ultimately arrived at Plymouth, after
being escorted by a detachment of the Commissariat and
Transport Corps, and received with a royal salute of
twenty-one fog-signals! So far as I could make out, my
train had been converted, towards the end of the journey,
into an excursion. Thank goodness, got back on board
my corvette. In the evening had a real fine time of it!
Read every line of my translations to the Mayors I had
entertained at dinner! I taught them what it was to
present addresses to me! All through the day was
haunted with the mysterious tune which was frequently
played to me.
Friday.—Hooray! On my way home! Just found
out, after consulting my band-master, that the puzzling
melody I have heard so often was various English ver-
sions of the Portuguese National Anthem Г Adieu,

SSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIAEY OF TOBY, M.P.
Haute of Commons, Monday Sept. 20.—Marvellons scene for mid-
September. All the benches filled and even some of the seats in the
ride galleries. GLADSTONE back again, evidently prepared to take
the bull by the horns. At first seemed as if HENEAGE was left to
represent the Unity of Liberalism. But presently HARTINGTON
strolled in.
"Awful bore, TOBY," he yawned at me; might be ш another and
a better place. But must be down to keep an eye on RANDOLPH. No
laying where he mightn't land us unless he's watched." So sat
down, kept his eye fixedly on RANDOLPH for space of ten minutes, at
end of which time was fast asleep.
Thus missed opportunity at question time of hearing GEOBGE
CAMPBELL'S delicate inquiry about JAMES THE SECOND. Thirst for
knowledge of "Hon. Baronet," as RANDOLPH
always calls him, growing painful in intensity.
Wants to know everything, and now suddenly
comes down on PLTTNKET with desire to know
whether JAMES THE SECOND was removed from
his throne for misconduct. PLUNKET not to be
drawn. Question put without notice. Not to
be lightly answered. So he gravely declared
his inability to give an opinion on the subject.
Pitiable to see CAMPBELL through rest of sitting;
grown distinctly older. Moved aimlessly about;
discovered sitting dejected in various out-of-
the-way corners; always brooding over the
unanswered question.
PABNELL moved Second Reading of his Ten-
ante' Relief (Ireland) Bill.

voice of EDTVABD, the numbing flood of pointlens commonplace
belonged to JOHN GEORGE. Interesting to watch RANDOLPH'S ex-
pressive face as JOHN GEOBGE floated along to his own satisfaction
and to the visible impatience of the House.
"Look out!" says BIDDTJLPH, eagerly watching performance from
extreme edge of an opposite bench. Another ten minutes of thie,
and RANDOLPH '11 pull him down by the coat-tails." GLADSTONE lone
ago lost his composure; tossed about on the seat; nervously clutched
a voluminous sheaf of notes; flashed to and fro great glimpses of red
stocking displayed above his shoe, as if GIBSON were the Bull of
Bavaria, and he were trying to move him out of his soul-seething
jog-trot of commonplace. But JOHN GEOBGE went his way to the
melancholy end, the House waking itself with a grateful cheer as
GLADSTONE sprung up, and stood at the
table. "Hoarse, Dut hearty," RANDOLPH
said, disconsolately, to MATTHEWS, who sat
by his side, and took note of his animated
commentary as GLADSTONE pounded along.

conveniently have been taken at midnight. By One o'clock m the
morning the very last word had been said. But JOHN DILLON
having button-holed the House, would not let it go. On he went,
from bad quarter of an hour to worse. Members left the House in
scores. Those that remained, including GLADSTONE, tossed restlessly
on their seats. They coughed and whispered to each other, and
yawned and moaned in sheer weariness of spirit. But all done in
modified tone. Had it been a poor English or Scotch Member, he
would have been peremptorily shouted down after his first twenty
minutes. But the humblest Irish Member not to be trifled with.

PUNCH, OE THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Comparing Notes.
COMPARING NOTES.
WITH the departure of the warm weather music begins to reassert
its sway. The Crystal Palace Concerts, ten in number, to be given
before Christmas, promise to be unusually interesting, and Mr.
Аивизт MANNS will resume the baton on Saturday, Oct. 16th, when
a new Spanish ballet, in E even short
movements, by MASSENET, is to be
heard for the first time in England.
The second Concert will be a tribute
of respect to the memory of LISZT,
and consist almost entirely of his
works.
At the Covent Garden Promenade
Concerts the evening of Sept. 29th was
devoted to the music of English Com-
posers. The Overture, by Mr. E. H.
THORITE, which gained the prize offered
last year by Mr. FREEMAN THOMAS,
was heard once more; and there is no
doubt that it is a work of considerable
merit, if of little inspiration. Mr.
GADSBY'S Scène, "The Forest of Arden "—this is down for perform-
ance at the Crystal Palace next year; an Intermezzo by Mr. E.
HOPKINS OuiJ); and a Scène de Sollet by_ Mr. H. M. HIGOS, were
also given and conducted by their respective authors. The last-
mentioned is a very original and taking production, containing much
ingenious instrumental combination, and having, particularly in the
first movement, allegro, an amount of " go " that is almost infectious.
The Composer was loudly cheered, and had he been of the grasping
order, might very well have construed the applause into an encore. As
it was, it was nearly eleven o'clock when the second part of the pro-
gramme was reached, and cutting and hacking was now perforce
indulged in with a ruthless hand. Mr. COWEN'S "Language of
Flowers" a piece which is generally overrated, to my thinking, and
which conveys the suggestion of "scrappiness" rather than happi-
ness; and Sir ARTHUR SULLIVAN'S bright music to "Henry the
Eighth" helped to swell an absurdly long programme. Mr. FBEDE-
BIC KIM; and Miss AKNIE MARRIOTT sang, and Madame FBICKEN-
HAT7S gave a clear rendering of STEHNDALE BENNETT'S favourite piano
Concerto in F, being fairly well accompanied by the band under
Mr. CALDICOTT.
The musió of "Dorothy," at the Gaiety, is in itself a distinct
feature of the season. Mr. CELLIEE'S music is of that order, that it
can stand by itself when once heard. Miss MARION HOOD is, pro-
bably, the only stage vocalist who could do full justice to the music
allotted to Dorothy. Mr. CELLIER'S treatment of the orchestra,
whether in accompaniments or symphonies, is, as usual, charac-
terised by the refinement of earnest intelligence.
At the Alhambra the ballet " Cupid" composed by M. JACOBI,
deserves by its high musieianly qualities, a far wider and more
intelligent recognition than it is usual to bestow upon this class of
work. There is more " stuff" in it, than in nine out of ten comió
operas, and the graceful themes of which it is constructed, besides
being treated with all the judgment of a practised orchestral writer,
are frequently handled with a truly symphonic grasp.
NlBELTTNGLET.
WITHIN (A.ND WITHOUT) THE GAIETY.
Лг.лк Mit. NrBBS,
You may possibly be interested to hear that the Gaiety is gay
no longer. Yes, the Gaiety of London is totally eclipsed; and the
theatre now has somewhat the air of a reformed rake. It strives to
be decorous and succeeds admirably—in being dull. It is remodelled
and decorated with a lavish hand, that only required the guidance of
good taste; the alterations in many cases are additions without
being improvements. Newly-decorated foyer, new act-drop, new
fittings, everything so new that it is a matter of surprise to find that
the old frieze, painted by STACY MARKS, has not been replaced by
something new and effective in red and gold lincrnsta. Mr. PHIPPS,
the theatrical architect, was in the House, and nearly had a fit when
he saw the "improvements." So much for the Theatre, now for the
Play.
Dorothy, is a Comedy Opera, not comic, you observe, far from it.
Music by ALFRED CELLIER, words by B. C. STEPHENSON, who, as he
seems only partially acquainted with the alphabet of libretto-writing,
might be called " А. В. С. STEPHENSON."
The music is much better than the plot—not that this is saying
much, and indeed as you will probably nave an expert at work on
this department, I shall say no more on this score—I mean on Mr,
СЮ,ЪГЕН'З score; but I fanoy_ that Herr MEYER Lriz must have
received instructions not to indulge in any of his old burlesque
frivolous ways, but to conduct the music gravely and sedately—
which he did. I was wondering whether he was awake all the time.
тот., ют. Q
The plot depends mainly on the chief characters continually dis-
guising themselves by the simple process—as it appeared to me—
of powdering their hair, which of course renders them perfectly
unrecognisable until the last Act, when everybody finds out every-
body else, and all ends happily. I am sure, speaking for myself, I
was quite pleased when it was over.
Miss MARION HOOD looked verypretty, acted spasmodically, and
sang delightfully; Mr. REDFERN HOLLLNS, who sang, but couldn't
act; poor Mr. HAYDEN COFFIN acts, but is not allowed to sing;; and
Mr..ARTHUR WILLIAMS, as a sheriff's officer, raised expectations of
the greatest amusement, which however were not destined to be
realised. He sings a'song in the First Act about "The King's own
writ I hold, Sir 7"—the style and the metre recalling "The Vicar
of Bray "—which is unfortunate for the song,—and otherwise gives
great offence to the villagers, who soon knock all the nonsense
out of him. So he sings no more facetious songs, and subsequently
retires into the background.
The unexpected introduction of a pack of at least twelve real live
harriers,—unmuzzled, but well under control,—brings the Second
Act to a sportive conclusion. I am informed that the idea of having
the harriers out on a September morning in a hop-country is quite
original, and, this not being a comic opera, the introduction of this
pack—quite "a pack of nonsense "—does Mr. A. B. C. STEPHENSON
all the more credit. What thorough sportsmen Messrs. CELLIER
and A. B. C. STEPHENSON must be! Yet if they brought the
hounds on the stage in anticipation' of a run, I fancy they will find
themselves rather "out of the hunt." On Saturday night, there
were loud calls for Mr. HARRIERS, or HARRIS, or somebody whose
name I couldn't quite catch. However, the rule on the Gaiety stage
just now seems to be, "When in doubt play A. B. C. STEPHENSON,"
and so this gentleman came forward and oowed, much to his own
satisfaction.
Each Act has its own elaborate set-scene, the second, Chanticleer
Hall, being the most effective, and the Round Coppice, by Messrs.
SPONG ani BANKS—(I have seen so many of the latter в stage pictures
representing scenes of town and rural life, that I like to think of
him as "London and County BANKS")—being the next best.
No expense—or material—has been spared by Manager EDWARDES
on the dresses. The fair wearers (two words which seem to suggest
"wayfarers," but this is " by the way") seem a little awkward in
their long-trained silken skirts, and I fear they will not have time to
grow accustomed to them.
There is a ballet, or dance of bridesmaids and groomsmen in the
last Act, but it is conducted on the strictest principles, half the stage
being occupied by old women—presumably chaperons—who keep up
a sort of droning comment on the proceedings which effectually
checks all hilarity.
The mise-en-scène] is good,—better than the misses-en-tccne men-
tioned above, — and the whole performance may be described as
perfectly innocuous, warranted neither to give offence nor to afford
much amusement. Yours, PENELOPE ANNE
PUZZLES.—Last Friday the Pall Matt Gazette announced that it
would give a prize for the best solution to an original puzzle. And
then the Editor was so puzzled to invent a puzzle, that he advertised
for an original puzzle to start with. But how he will prevent the
inventor or the puzzle from also winning it, is another puzzle for
himself. If a daily paper cannot sell without puzzles, why not make
it all puzzles? Puzzle-leaders, puzzle-correspondence, puzzle-
telegrams, puzzle-latest news! Why not? That 's another puzzle.
Now, here is an Art-Puzzle, of which Mr. Punch is ready to confess
he does not know the solution :—Puzzle—'Row to deal with the Royal
Academy Difficulty so as to satisfy everybody inside and outeide
the Academy.
SCTMITTNO Ur.—After 'several months' inquiry, the Police Com-
mission arrived at the satisfactory conclusion that "accidents will
happen in the best-regulated families," and have made a few sug-
gestions,—such, for example, as the appointment of a few Chief
Constables of (food social position, without any previous special train-
ing for this kind of employment,—which, if adopted, will probably
render the chances of a good muddle on any given occasion rather
less improbable than it was before,—that 's all.
INEVITABLE.—Mr. Punch knew how it would be. Since the
election of the new LORD MAYOR he has been inundated with letters
suggesting that as Sir REGINALD HANSON at the close of his speech
said that his devotion to his duties would prevent him from being an
entire failure in his office, he must remember that at the end of his
mayoralty he will merely be judged by the old proverb, "HANSON is
as HANSON does." [At least a hundred beaux eipriti nave all met
over this epigram.]

hear that Mr. VAUGHAN gave a "cab tout;" one of the
pests of the Lyceum Theatre, seven days' imprisonment

police should license a large number of town porters, who
might wear a badge, and have a regular tariff. And he
further suggests to the Managers of theatres that a very
much better system of cab-callmg might become universal.
if Mr. AUGUSTUS HARRIS'S plan, of employing boys in
uniform, "under proper control," to fetch cabs and
carriages, were developed. Generally speaking, the scene
outside a theatre, after the entertainment is over, is dis-
graceful; and many who have once experienced it are
loth, even for "the greatest attraction, to encounter it
of tener than they can possibly help.

need and utility, even the salubrity and safety, of that sacred
institution, the cold morning tub.]
TUBBETO or not tubbing, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in a man to suffer
The stings and shivers of an icy sponging,
Or take up arms against a tyrant custom.
And by opposing end it ?—To peel,—to plonge
No more; not, fresh from sleep, to undergo
The dull ache, and the douche's frigid shocks
That flesh so shrinks from,—'tis a consummation
Devoutly to he wished. To He,—to sleep,—
To sleep! perchance to dream :—no shuddering scrub,
No dismal thought of what cold chills must come
When we have shuffled our pyjamas off,
Need give us pause! 'Tis the respect for custom
That makes the morning tub of so long life:
Por who would bear the whips and stings of cold,
The tumble out, the hasty ice-breaking,
The pangs of the first plunge, the heart's delay,
The tremulous knee-knocking, and the "turns"
That quivering ganglions of the shower-bath take,
When he at ease his morning wash could do
In tepid comfort? Who would goose-skin bear,
To grunt and shake under a down-pour chill,
But that the dread of what the world would say—
That "unknown quantity," whose shadowy fiat
No fellow disobeys—puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear the üls we have.
Than fly to comfort that we 're wishful of r
Thus Custom doth make cowards of us all,
And thus the sense and comfort of ablution
Are sacrificed to false ideas of health;
And Sawbones' saws and sanitary twaddle
Make winter's mornings frigid misery,
All in the name of cleanliness!
M. НАВЛЕК Hicxr, editor and proprietor of Triboukt,
has again sent his seconds to challenge somebody who has
given him offence. M. HARDEN HICKY is a harden'd
duellist, and being always a principal, he may fairly be
described as, in these affairs, "nutft еесипаиг," i.e.,
"Nobody's Second."

not "the Order of the Dey." It is in the gift of

HAULBT, served up en Omelette à la Comédie Française, seems, to have been
a qualified success. The correspondents of the London papers differ in their
accounts of the performance. The Parisian Correspondent of the Times— (does
M. DE BL-W-TZ stoop to ephemeral theatrical matters P)—observes that "some
suppressions are ill-considered," as, for example, "the arrival at the end of
the play of Fortinbras' victorious army," which, he says, "is rather a grave
gap, for at the fall of the curtain Denmark remains literally without any chief
and without any government." But surely the management of the Français
has only followed the English rule in this "suppressio vert," for, within the last
thirty or forty years, what English manager, producing Hamlet, ever thought of
bringing in Fortinbras and his victorious army? Which simply comes to this,
what English manager ever played the piece as it was intended to be played,
and so ending the play as SHAKSPEARE intended it to be ended? Some manager
did, we believe, restore Fortinbrai, but if it has been done within the last
quarter of a century, we, having been present at most notable revivals, do
not remember to have seen it. Perhaps Fortinbrat and his victorious army
may have always arrived late—like BLÜCHER—and so did not reach the soene
of carnage until the curtain was down and the lights out. The French authors
are hardly to blame for this suppression, which is scarcely a novelty.
The Standard Correspondent notices an introduction about which "the rest
is silence."—or, strictly speaking, the rest are silent,—with the exception of course
of Mr. Punch's Representative, whose eagle eye observes everything, It is that
Hamlet after hearing Horatio11 account of the Ghost, has a flirtation scene with
Ophelia, in which he presents her with that celebrated copy of verses which
Poloniue subsequently finds and reads to the King. This is an innovation with
a vengeance.
The Critic on the Figaro thinks that the play is too long for a French
audience, and suggests that after Ophelia's mad scene there should be
a considerable "cut," which would bring them as soon as possible to the
fencing-match, which is evidently the feature of the piece.
One thing has surprised us, that nowhere have we read how Mr. lavnre in
London, and Mr. W. BARRETT in America, telegraphed at once to M. MOUITET-
SULLY saying, "English Dramatic Art wishes you success. Bless you! Go on
and prosper!" On such an occasion we should have thought that "bang goes
saxpenee for a telegram would have inspired the action of the generous
histrions.

A WATER COURSE.
IX.
One More on Untaire.
IF the waters of Royat hadn't put plenty of iron into me, I don't
think my nerves could have stood a second ride on Untaire. But the
Colonel persuades me, and after a day's rest I am ready for the effort.
'' It is the only way to know the country," says the Colonel, whose

Every moment on grass with

Untaire on1 me or on his back.
And then?'
Luckily the Colonel agrees
with me.and prefers the rocky
path. We descend through
very wet bushes, the branches
slapping our faces for our im-
pudence. At last we are in a
better road, a steep ascent,
rather good going, and conse-

route, and exclaims, "See! there is away by thoseiyineyards!"
And before I can remonstrate, and point out that this is almost
certain to be private property, he has urged Risette into a gallop and
is half-way down a narrow
path between two vine-
yards. I see in the distance
the upper half of the Col-
onel above a low stone wall,
which now borders the road.
Untaire catches sight of
Risette and impelled by his
strong affection for her, it
occurs to him that he can
break through all obstacles
that separate them, and
so, instead of waiting for
the corner of the road, he
makes straight for the wall
in front of us, on the other

sees Risette galloping away in the distance. I pull at him, but to no
purpose, but he had not reckoned on a blind ditch, and into this he goes
with a dash that brings his nose sharp up against the wall. . .
Like the wondrous wise man celebrated in verse for the feat of
jumping into and out of a quickset hedge, Untaire no sooner finds his
fore-legs in the ditch, than he extricates them, backs himself on to
the roaa, perceives the right-angled corner of the wall, and in order
to rectify his error as soon as possible, makes for it at such a pace,
that, before I can do anything in the way of guiding him, he has
swerved round it so sharply as to bring my right boot in contact with
.ess too, but his head well for-

How his shoes stay on is a marvel! I catch a glimpse of the
Colonel as he darts round a sharp corner, and I only devoutly trust
that I may make no mistake as to the exact turning, or I shall be lost
in the wood. Round to the right we go, at such an acute angle, and at
such a tremendous pace, that the sudden change in the direction
nearly upsets us both, and Untaire, who has been galloping right
foot foremost, now suddenly substitutes the left, in order appa-
rently to save himself from coming down on his side; but he executes
the movement with such a jerk, followed by such a heavy stumping
action, that I begin to fear he must have dislocated his shoulder, or
otherwise severely injured some portion of his frame. He recovers
himself, however, and I _ become accustomed to the stumping move-
ment, which is just as if he had got a wooden foreleg. No sign of
the Colonel. Just as we reach the top I see the phantom Colonel
vanishing round another corner half-way down the descent. Untaire
has caught sight of Risette's tail, and hastens to rejoin her.
Full pelt down-hill, Risette kicking up the mud, and suddenly
stopping, reined in with a jerk by the Colonel, as Untaire, whom I
am unable to curb in his bold career, cannons against her. No
injury done to men or beasts. What 's the matter?
"V'la !" shouts the Colonel, roaring with laughter, as he points
to a notice-board. "Eet ees La Pépinière. We are trespassing.
In another moment will the gardener see us. No dogs, no horses
allowed. Come back, or it will be an amende if they catch us.
Houpiu.'" And without further parley he turns Risette and flies
at a Diok-Turpin-to-York pace back again. Untaire doesn't wait to
be guided, but goes round suddenly, as if on a pivot, and bolts
after his favourite Risette. Sharp to the left, over some stumps of
trees, across a small stream, over some rocks—up, up, up, until we
find ourselves galloping on the hill above the beautifully-kept
grounds of La Pépinière, where the gardeners and a garde champêtre
are now keeping a vigilant eye on our movements.
"Ah! we wiu take first road to right," cries the Colonel. "There
must he a way down."
There is. Such a way! I don't believe any horses have ever been
on this trackless path before. It is all rock, and so steep, that even
the Colonel is compelled to proceed at a careful walking pace. He has
a plan for crossing by a wood below, and making for a village which
he sees some way off, then round to Royat by a short cut,—always
a short cut, as if we were in a desperate hurry on some matter of
life and death, instead of being out for a quiet ride at four francs
an hour.
After effecting our rocky descent, we have a treacherous bit of
mossy grass, but, thank goodness, not much of it, and we issue on to a
road which leads us by orchards and fruit-trees, through a picturesque
village, which is not the one the Colonel meant, but with which, as it
is a village, he is equaUy delighted. Then we find ourselves on a
high road, very white, very hot, and very hard.
This doesn't suit the Colonel, who instantly discovers a cross-country

Luckily, Royat appears in sight, and I am no longer dependent on
following the Colonel's

flavoured guide—one who comes under the "Highly-Flavoured
Nation" clause,—who is leaning his elbow on the rampart.
"There! there !" she exclaims. "Don't you see those creatures!"
If it had been a riVeur who after indulging rather too freely, had
exclaimed, "Look! those horrid creatures i See, there they are
again.} popping up!" I should at once have been able to trace his
agitation to the probable cause. But with Cousin JANE who is almost
a teetotaller, whose general health has been so much improved by the
César baths, and her nerves by the iron in the waters, it is another
affair, and I am, for the moment appalled as if in the presence of
some frightful calamity.
But the Highly Flavoured One hits on the right solution as he
points to some funny little yellow heads which are peeping up
between the crevices of the old stones in the blazing heat of this
tropical afternoon.
I am much relieved, and explain, as does the guide also, that they
are quite harmless, and that this hide-and-seek is only their play.
"What are they called?" I ask.
"Lêzardines," answers the guide.
Cousin JAJTE is indignant. She gives a sniff in the air, and
observes that the man must take us for fools to try and impose on us
in this way.
I am mystified, and so I ask him again what is the name of these
creatures, and he makes the same answer, " Lêzardines."
"There! lLes Sardines'.'" exclaims Cousin JANE. "As if we
didn't know what sardines were. Nonsense 1"
Cousin JANE has certainly been benefited considerably by the
waters of lloyat.
THE ORACLE EXPLAINED.
_РншсЕ BISMARCK, questioned by the Mayor of Reichenbach as to
his views on the Eastern Question, laconically advised him to " read
Faust." The Prince, it seems, has since relieved a puzzled world
by pointing out the particular passage in Faust which he refers to.
Mr. Punch, still further simplifies the matter by presenting, to the
Prince and others, his adaptation of the passage in question. It is
not slavishly literal, but it probably expresses the Chancellor's
views none the worse for that :—
In cynic mood there 's nought I take delight in
Like hearing gossips prate of war's array;
(And of my plans the purblind fools affrighting,)
Whilst round poor Turkey's lingering decay
The beasts and birds of prey are fighting.
I sit, look on, and shape things to my ends,
And watch all sorts of interests colliding,
Unto all which ironic zest it lends
To talk of mutual trust and peace abiding.
This slightly resembles TAYLOR'S version of the same passage. But
it is Sartor Resartus.
"Girara HTM SITOFF."—In the Daily Telegraph's interesting
Leader on the DUC D'ATTMALE'S splendid gift to the French Institute
as trustees for the nation, it is recounted how a certain Prince in
merry mood administered a pinch or two of snuff in a bumper of
champagne to a " drôle" who died of the effects, and whose death
was "of no consequence," since he was only a "drûle" the less.
Messrs. J. L. TOÓLE and GEO. GROssiirm, who bask in the smiles of
Royalty, must thank their lucky stars (and garters, when they 've
"got 'em on ") that they live in the " so-called nineteenth century,"
and not in the seventeenth. Were the trick ever tried on either of
them it would not succeed, as they are both well " up to snuff."
EXTRA-OFFICIAL HEROISM.—Life-Guardsman BENJAMIN ROBERTS
may, for dutiful pluck, pair ofi with Constable COLEMAN. He, alone
among a lot of bystanders, went to the assistance of a Policeman
who was attacked by some two hundred roughs, and, at the cost of
considerable knocking about, and the loss of three teeth, rescued
the Constable from his cowardly assailant!. Mr. Commissioner
KERR, very naturally expressed a wish to reward BENJAMIN ROBERTS.
Mr. Commissioner Punch does reward bim—with an honourable
place in his immortalising pages.
To THE FFNGIVEBOUS.—If it be true that Colonel GASCOIQNE, of
Parlington Hall, near Leeds, has planted certain yards of manure,
lying idle, with mushroom-spawn, and obtained from 122 of them, a
crop which he sold for £106, clearing a profit on total expenses, rent
included, over cent, per cent., then sing Farmers all, "Away with
melancholy!" for where agricultural depression now exists there
will be mush-room for improvement.
GOOD OMEK ш IRELAND.—It is a noteworthy coincidence that
Moonlight is disappearing with the dawn of DAT. Moonlight, let us
hope, will vanish altogether, much to the daylight of the terrorised
tenant-farmers.
BACK TO TOWN.
BACK to Town, and it certes is rapture to stand,
And to hear once again all the roar of the Strand;
I agree with the bard who said, noisy or stilly,
By gaslight or daylight, he loved Piccadilly;
The wanderer's heart with emotion doth swell,
When he sees the broad pavement of pleasant Pall Mall.
Some folks like the City; wherever they range,
Their hearts are still true to the Royal Exchange;
They 've beheld Alpine summits rise rank upon rank,
But the Matterhorn 's nothing compared with the Bank;
And they feel quite rejoiced in the omnibus ride,
As that hearse for the living rolls up through Cheapside.
The mind of .a man'is expanded by_travel,
But give me my house on the Kensington gravel:
The wine of the Frenchman is good, and his grab,
But he isn't devoted to soap and the tub;
Though it may be my prejudice, yet I '11 be shot,
If I don't think one Englishman s worth all the lot!
With Germans I 've no disposition to quarrel,
Though most of their women resemble a barrel;
And, as for myself, I could never make out
The charms of their schnitzel and raw saner-kraut;
While everyone owns, since the last mighty war,
Tour average Teuton 's too bumptious by far.
I think it 's been stated before, that you roam
To prove to yourself that there's no place like home,
Though lands that are lovely lie Eastward and West,
Our "Tight little Island," believe me.'s the best:
Through Paris, Berlin, and Vienna you 've passed,
To find that there 's nothing like London at last!
"WHAT'S SPORT TO HIM," &c.
A SPORTING Correspondent furnished the P. M. G. with some
curious details of stag-hunting in the neighbourhood of Exmoor.
He says that the stags are "fat and lazy, and, when hard pressed,
make their way to the beach and swim out to sea, when they are
captured, towed ashore, and have their throats cut." This, regarded
as " sport," is so extremely peculiar, that it fairly'staggers the mere
outsider. It is, however, suggestive of a new departure in the shape
of a Hunting Chorus, and might be handled effectively somehow
thus:— "Wbat ho! for the blast of the hunter's horn!
He'll blow, though the sport of its "go" be shorn.
For what cares he what the stag may be at;
He knows fuü well that, grown lazy and fat,
He '11 make for the beach, caring nothing for him,
With his eye to the sea, and bent on a swim.
When ho! for the hunter, he takes his boat
And follows the stag, and outs its throat.
And it 's "Ho!" he shouts, as he tows him ashore'.!
For what on earth can the hunter do more?
For though not exactly first-rate sport,
He may think that it's something of the sort.
So treat not the quaint hunter's blast with scorn,
As, ho! he endeavours to wind his horn!
THE Rev. J. G. PATÓN, a missionary who has spent some years at
the New Hebrides, in writing of those just now interesting islands, says
that, thirty-seven years since, "the whole population were nude canni-
bals," but that owing to the missionary influence, about 20,000 are now
sufficiently civilised " to wear less or more clothing." Seeing that
these original islanders had nothing on at all, it is not easy to under-
stand how they can well have worn less, though it is not difficult
under the circumstances to conceive the possibility of their wearing
a little more. It may be that the choice of patterns submitted, may
not have found favour with the Cannibals, in which case no time
should be lost in obtaining the services of Messrs. BENJAMIN,
SAMUEL, or HTAMS. who wouLd no doubt be able to take the matter
well in hand; and, with an efficient staff of tailors at his back,
Mr. PATÓN would soon find his most improving proteges adopting
good habits.
Paradoxical, but True.
"GOOD times for the Turf!" cries the prophet. No doubt,
For the sharp, the swell jockey, the trickster, and tout.
But for sport, honest men, and good horses, we know
That good times will not come till the better times go.

ELIGIBLE ROYAL OPPORTUNITY. A THRONE TO LET.— Owing to its having
become recently vacant through the sudden and somewhat unexpected collapse of the
late occupant, the Proprietors of one of these highly desirable and valuable Seata, situated
in an exhilarating neighbourhood in Eastern Europe, are anxious to meet with a new
tenant willing to accommodate himself to the peculiar and agreeable features of the tenure
with which it is intended that it shall be henceforth associated. The Applicant, who
should have a decidedly robust constitution accustomed to night-surprises, must be thick-

THE LATEST TRICK.
AN amateur Wizard, of character shady,
A conjuror doubtful, though wearing a
crown,
Is trying the trick of the Vanishing Lady,
"Which lately so greatly has taken the Town.
A very old trick in a somewhat new setting,
But possibly little the worse for its age. _
After going the rounds, it appears to be getting
A place on the foreign political stage.
'Twixt conjuring skill and diplomacy's dodges
The difference really seems wondrously
small.
Great HOUDIN could puzzle the Cockneys and
Hodges;
The wily diplomatist jockeys us all.
The juggler is frankly a juggler, he tells us;
His object hard cash, and nie mode sleight
of hand;
Bnt 'tis for our good that diplomacy sells us,
Its motives are lofty, its objects are grand.
Our Autocrat-Wizard, in trying it on so,
Is playing—who doubts it?—a fatherly
part.
Perhaps when false Imogene diddled Alanzo,
She jilted the youth in pure kindness of
heart.
But even Imperial Jugglers must juggle
With deftness of passing and swiftness of
stroke,
And he will need smartness and skill if he 41
smuggle
That form unsuspected from under that
cloak.
Finesse with effrontery, palming with patter,
Must go to the making a Royal YEKBECK.
He who thinks that brute forcing will settle
the matter.
May make a mistake, and may meet with a
check.
Hey presto! Bulgarians' freedom to banish
Were quite à la Russe, a true Romanoff
But what if this Vanishing Lady won't vanish?
The trick is a taking one. Will it succeed?

MR. PUNCH DRINKS TO SIR REGINALD HANSON THE LORD MAYOR ELECT.
ROBERT AT THE LORD MARE'S ELECTION.
AGAIN, and wunce more, for about the six hundred and ninety haith time,
as I was kindly hin formed by the Citty Serliciter, who reelly seams to know
exaoly about every l hink, and everybody, did the sewen thowsand Liverymen,
but all out of Livery for this himportant ocashun, assemble together in their
hundreds at Gildhall on Wensday larst—all comming through separate little
wickets, so that the several Beedles mite have a good look at 'em_to see if they was
all rite,—to perform the most sollem dooty of their whole Liveried existence,
wiz., the election of the LORD MARE for the year as is to come. And agane did
the hole Court of Aldermen, all in the skarlet panoply of their dignified existence,
march in full state out of the Hall before the Election begun, for fear as the other-
wise bold Livervmen mite be so awed by their presence as to choose the rong
man. Not as there was mutch chance of that being done this time, wotever
there was sum few years ago, for everybody knowed that as Sir REGINALD
HANSON was willing for to be the nex LOBD МАЛЕ, the nex LOKD MABE he
would be.
Does anybody arsk me why? "Why because, as BHOWN says, and I quite
agrees with him, he 's wot we calls a regl'ar Staggerer. Am I still arsked why?
Why becoz in the first place he 's a Alderman, that must cum fust. In the second
Elaee he 's a X Sheriff. In the third place he 's a Colonel. In the forth place
e 's a leader in the werry noblest, and most eharitablest, and most prosperousest
of all our 89 Livery Companys, and fifthly and larstly, but suttenly not leastly,
he's a Master of Hearts of Cambridge! BBOWN tried werry hard to perswade
me as he was also a mere Feller of sum place, but I wasn't a going to bleeve sitoh
a hinsulting thing as that.
Well, I should think as that's somethink like a good charakter for the place.
I couldn't git another chanse of arsking the Citty Solicitor, or I dessayhe coud
ha' told me, whether among his C97 ancestors afore him, there had bin one who
cpud beat him in this respec. I shoud he inclined to say of him, if I dared to do
siteh a think, that if ewer he has to play at other things beside cards during
his rain, however much others may win by tricks, he '11 always be виге to win
with honours. Witch I thinks is won to me. Well, after the Aldermen had all
left, all but the few as was left in their right, a werry sollem-looking gent asked
permission to ask the candidates jest a few questions, but wen Sir lire INA i.D
strode boldly forth to anser him, the pore feller in the crowd seemed so nervous
that I coudn't hear a word he said, but Sir REGINALD did, and ansered him rite
off the reel, and then storked away. The show of hands was then taken, and
woud suttenly have made a better show if they had all a been carefully washed.
I didn't quite understand how it was, but the Sheriffs told us as too Aldermen
was elected, but I 'm sure as they was quite rong, for Sir REGINALD had amost
all the hands held up for him. However, the Court of Aldermen soon put that
rite wen they was told on it, and all marched back into Gildball and told sum
grate swell to tell us as it were all right. So then, just
I suppose to keep the pore old LOBD MABE in good sper-
rits on this to him meloncolly ocasión, we all guv him a
reel arty wote of thanks for his parst serwices, and then,
jest to make eweryboddy quite cumferal, we did the same
for the too departm Sherryffs, pore fellers! who had had
their butiful scarlet gownds and gold chañes stripped off
'em, only the day before, as the werry larst dooty of their
late gorgehus footmen. And then cum one of them werry
moving pare of Specktacles when they was all a leaving
the All, that I never heard of taking place outside the
sacred Citty.
The old Lord Mare and the new Lord Mare, wisely
hiding the several feelinx as must natrally have filled
their manly bnzzpms, the won of bitter regret, and the
other of beeomming pride, acshally marched out together,
side by side, a larfing and a chatting like two Bryde-
grooms, which they most suttenly warn't, and went and
dined together! Do we see this noble display of the
werry hiest feelinx of our humane natur at the West
Hend of London. Suttenly not. Wen too Prime
Ministers meet under similar surkumstances, do they
march out together harm-and-harm, and a larfing and
a chatting together, and then go and dine together like
too Lord Mares? Suttenly not! O contraír, as the
forreners says. For instance, do Lord SORLSBERBY and
Mr. GLADSTONE do so wen they gos to Winser? Don't
we all kno that the strictest orders is given by the
peace-lovingiQueen that they shood never be aloud to
be in Winser Carsell together for fear of what mite
foller. Ar! if the West wood but take exarmpel from
the Heast in hevery 'thing else as well as in Dinners,
wot a different world it wood be! But this is one of
them jrlorypus thorts as we can ony dream about, noing
too well as it is far too grand hever to real-lies.

She was to pay £6 10». for the machine, and had paid the whole
of that amount with the exception of 1». 6rf., which she had been
unable to pay through misfortune. The collector, a few days
since, came and asked to look at the number of the machine.
Applicant showed him the machine, when he caught hold of it
and took it away. The consequence was that she had not since
been able to obtain a livelihood. Mr. LUSHINOTON informed
the applicant that if she could get a portion of the 7». oW. owing,
he would send one of the officers of the Court with her to the
people she had the machine from, and he would try and get it
back for her, on the understanding that she should pay the
remainder as soon as she could."—fall Mall Oazelts.
THE Song of the Shirt was a sorrowful lay,
And pictured a pitiful scene,
But would there be much that is jocund and gay
In the Song of the Sewing Machine?
What a heart of hronze, what muscles of steel
Should the woman have who is Slave of the Wheel!
One pities the pallid and pain-racked girl
Who is thrall to its ceaseless monotonous whirl.
"Suffices it not to spoil,
With harsh and mercúess toil,
The grace and glee of girlhood's life,
To stunt the maiden, to cripple the wife

When the wearied limbs, the shuddering soul,
Slacken and stop 'ere the final dole

All for the good of the toiling poor !—
So men babble, and shut the door
Fast on hope. And yet, and yet

To see 'tis but one tyrant more
To plump the rich and harry the poor.
AUTUMNAL REFLECTIONS.—Mrs. RAMSBOTHAM walk-
ing through the lanes, and noticing the elderberries
brightening the hedgerows, wonders "what on earth
becomes of the younger ones?"
"IT'S NICE TO BE A (CITY) FATHER!"
THE visit paid the other day by the Corporation to Clissold Park
appears to have been altogether a very charming sylvan affair.
Descending from their "handsome drag," the happy members, so
said a letter to the Time», "went carefully over the whole estate,"
having "lingered beneath spreading cedars," and "strolled down
the meadow," till, "congregating on a slight knoll," they finally
"lounged up the path by the water's edge beneath the beautiful
chestnuts," till it was evident that " they were all charmed with
the beauty of the spot." Nothing is said about any pause for re-
freshment, but it is to be presumed that the "handsome drag" of
the Corporation was not unprovided with a hamper or two suitable
for the occasion, on which the residents in the North of London are
to be congratulated, inasmuch as the portly visitors expressed their
opinion'that it would " be a great advantage to preserve Clissold Park
as an open space for the recreation of the public for ever." Evidently
the members of the Corporation had a most enjoyable time of it,
which, if in the midst of their lounging, and lingering, and strolling,
they managed to throw in a brief conventional pic-nic, they must
have founa pretty well perfect.
"THE EJECTED MINISTERS."'—Under this title there was a con-
siderable correspondence last week in the Times. Judge the dis-
appointment of a majority of Conservative readers when they found
that the letters were about the Nonconformist tinkers, tailors,
singers, and cobblers, evicted from benefices in 1652, and contained
not a word, not even a syllable, of scandal about Mr. GLADSTONE, Sir
W. НАНСОТГНТ, SirCHABXES RUSSELL &Co., "the Ejected Ministers"
of 1886.
HOW DO THEY DO IT?
THE private lives of the new Sheriffs, Mr. Alderman ISAACS and
Lieutenant-Colonel KIKBY, promise respectively to be of a very
magnificent and altogether sumptuous and peculiar character. At
least such is the judgment that would be formed by anyone reading
an account of some clothes that they have apparently been ordering
for their men-servants. The " state-coats" of those of the former
"are of rich maroon silk velvet, laced with gold lace of the ' feather'
pattern, and the fronts, sleeves, back, &c., embroidered in gold with an
artistic design of the 'convolvulus' pattern; the waistcoats and breeches
being of white buckskin, richly trimmed with gold lace. The semi-state
coats and waistcoats are of superfine cloth of the same shade as the velvet,
and are tastefully trimmed in a similar manner to the state-coats."
The " state-coats" of the latter are even more striking, being
"of rich bright green silk velvet, with lace of the ' wave ' pattern, there
trimmed with gold."
And it adds, in conclusion, that—
"The semi-state livery is entirely novel, both in form and in ornamentation."
The question naturally arises, in the face of all this splendour, how
on earth do those who are to be daily associated with it propose to
live up to it Y Will Mr. Alderman ISAACS breakfast daily on a
service of gold-plate in the presence of forty guests? and will
Lieutenant-Colonel Кгквт lunch lounging on an ottoman and
quaffing superior brands of Imperial Tokay out of jewelled goblets?
It is difficult to conceive any sort of existence that will pull them up
to the level of their retainers' state-coats.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

SCENE FROM THE METROPOLITAN SENSATIONAL DRAMA OF "THE LONDON SCHOOL BOARD; OR, THE BCCIE IKQUISITOR."
BY PRIVATE INQUIRY.
РОРТ/ЪАВ agitators are never tired of insisting1 that whatever pro-
gress the country professes to make on the pathway of equal liberties
for all alike, there is yet too often one law for the rich and another
for the poor; and to judge by the latest exploit of the London School
Board, they would certainly seem to have some reason for their out-
cry. That august body has issued a sort of "Inquisition" paper,
for the purpose of ascertaining the circumstances of the parents of
non-paying children, that would do credit to the instincts of the
consulting attorney of the sharpest Loan Office. The document in
question plunges with prying acumen into the secrets of the home-
life of the family for which it is destined, and it remains to he seen
whether it will be respectfully filled up and returned, or consigned,
as Mrs. WESTLAKE hinted it would most likely be, with contempt
and indignation, to the neighbouring gutter. Meantime it might
serve to throw some liçht on the tactics of the Board to imagine its
action extended to a higher social level, and conceive the possibility
of a similar " Inquisition" into the circumstances, say, of the Upper
and Upper Middle Classes who patronise our great public schools. It
might be useful, especially in the case of delayed payment of the
half-yearly bills, for the governing bodies of Eton, Winchester,
Rugby, Westminster, and Harrow, for instance, to form a sort of
syndicate, for the purpose of getting at the parents, with a circular
similar in spirit and character to that just prepared by the London
School Board. Something on the following lines might be tried with
effect:—
1. Are you a Duke, or Member of the House of Lords, and if so,
state whether you have ever ficured in the Divorce Court, or have
arranged your affairs bv liquidation.
2. If a Member of Parliament, or having business in the City,
have you had to put down your carriage, give up your footman,
diminish the number of your dinners, or in any other way curtail
your ordinary expenditure?
3. If so, state for how long, and furnish particulars in each case.
4. What is the present amount of your unpaid bills, and on what
terms do you stand respectively with your butcher, your baker, your
bootmaker, and your tailor?
5. Have you been recently posted at any of your Clubs for non-
payment of subscription, and if so, state at which, supplying any
extenuating circumstance or excuse that you may be able to furnish.
6. When you visit a Theatre do you pay for Stalls, or get in by an
admission for two to the Upper Boxes?
7. Is your Mother-in-law one of the recognised members of your

8. Add any further particulars of your private family history
that you may think necessary, specially giving the number and
names of your poor relations, the amount of your return to the
Income-tax Commissioners, the price you pay for a new hat, the
sum total of your washing, cigar, and cab bills, and any other details
that may occur to you as bearing on your possible insolvency.
It can scarcely be doubted that if the above list of questions were
briskly distributed at a number of West-End addresses, the best
results would follow. Anyhow the idea of serving up to the gander
in the squares, the same sauce that is considered good enough for the
goose in the slums, is worth consideration, and might just now be
acted upon with considerable attendant success.
COLEMAN OF LEICESTER.
WHO talks about Ajax? That muscular Greek
Was out-heroed by COLEMAN of Leicester last week.
Great Ajax objected to fight in the dark,
But Constable COLEMAN, the stalwart and stark,
For two long night hours like a bull-dog held on
To that tiger-like convict. Brave Bobby, well done!
What feat of a classical hero, a Viking,
Or Paladin plucky, was ever more striking?
WAKE-HEREWARD'S splendid set-to with the bear
Was a fight with which COLEMAN'S may fitly compare;
But Bruin was less of a brute, on the whole,
Than the biting burglarious NUTTISO. The roll
Of Constables brave holds no worthier name
Than COLEIIAN of Leicester! Punch drinks to his fame!

"THE
JULIUS СЛЕЗАВ, WISELY DECLINES
COLINDEBIES" TESTIMONIAL.
"Why there was " a testimonial " offered him; and being offered him, he
put it by with tho back of his hand, thus ; and then the people fell a-Bhouting."
Julius Casar, Act 1, Scene ii.
"SIR HAMLET ESQUIRE," AT THE THÉÂTRE FRANÇAIS.
MY DEAB MR. NIBBS,—You expressed a wish to learn what
SHAKSPEABE'S hest-known tragedy would be like when a translation
of it was produced in Paris. To near with me was to obey, and like
the trusty but misguided Knights, who assisted HENRY THE SECOND,
in ridding him of an ecclesiastical difficulty, I sallied forth deter-
mined to overcome all obstacles—be they what they might—in
ministering to the wishes of my theatrical Lord and Master. I braved
the tedium of travel getting from Victoria to Dover, the dangers of
the vasty deep on my passage to Calais, and the terrors of illness, if
not death, at a buffet on the other side of the Channel. But I got to
the Français and was present at the first performance of Hamlet.
And now, deeply respected Sir, you shall know all about it.
The audience was what the London papers would call a " brilliant
one." The fauteuils d'orchestre were filled with Frenchmen in
evening dress, looking as Frenchmen always do en grand tenue, like
foreign waiters at a City dinner. The loges contained a number of
ladies in the most elaborate toilettes de ¿a/tempered with gaxAen-fete
bonnets. There were celebrities here, there, and everywhere. This
in spite of the dull season of the year. "But what? you will say,
"has this to do with Hamlet?" "Nothing," I reply, "save this—
the front of the house to many of those present, was more attractive
than the play beyond the f oothghts. SHAKSPEABE was triste—society
charming I" But to return. In a silence the curtain rose showing
indistinctly the ramparts of the castle. Then there was a whisper.
There was a ray of light—was this for "the spectre?" No. The
Ghost appeared and had a little glimmer all to himself. Then
came the explanation. M. MouNEi-StrLLY, so it was announced,
had protested against giving up any of his lime-light to M. MATTBANT.
Hamlet wasjealous of his murdered father! So the ray was reserved,
in Scene III. (£'Esplanade), for the portly person who played the
Prince of Denmark.
The translation of DUMAS PÈRE and PAUL METTRICE proceeded.
"We had the Scene in the Palace with the Court assembled—everyone
appearing in costumes of very gorgeous material, but like other Paris
fashions "quite new and never before worn in England." The
audience after appreciating the spectacle, seemed unutterably bored,
until Hamlet's confidential chat with the Spectre, when the solution
of the burning question of the limelight for a moment excited
curiosity. The instant "le Spectre" and "son Altesse" appeared
together it was found that M. MQTJNET-SÍTLLY, like a greedy boy,
was to have all the rays of the moon to himself, and his poor ill-
used parent not one of them!
That you may judge how very listless the spectators were, I may
inform you that the first genuine round of applause came when
Hamlet put to rest '' the perturbed spirit" of his й mole " of a father
by allowing the shadow of the hilt of his sword to rest'upon the
ground beneath which his parent was urging him and his friends to
The play continued. The scenery was feeble and commonplace,
and the acting indifferent. Had I not known that I was in the first
Theatre of France, and consequently the World, I should have
imagined I was assisting at a performance somewhere in the Pro-
vinces. The Pelonius of GOT was not to be compared with COMMON
in the same character, and REICHEMBERG in Ophelia was merely
the ordinary inyeniie of French Comedy grafted into a Tragedy.
GOT had evidently shared with the Actress this view of the proper
reading of the part, as he treated the unfortunate " Ophélie " with a
roughness denoting supreme contempt for her sweet imbecility. Here
I may note that to improve upon SHAKSPEAUE, MM. DTJMAS and
MEUBICE caused " son Altesse" to give his "Mees" a love-letter in
the presence of the audience. The Prince with a " tiens!" thought
for a moment with his forefinger on his brow, and then "knocked off
an impromptu" on his tablets. He tore out the leaf, folded it up
neatly, and with a courteous smile handed it to " Ophélie," (who
received it with what the French dramatists call "a movement")
and then, .evidently well satisfied with his literary performance,
sauntered off apparently to communicate his amorous manœuvre to
Horatio. To continue my ideas about the merits of the company.
The portly representative of Hamlet produced a portrait of FECHTEB
painted in hysterics. He was always gasping or fainting, and
although he had a good piece of " business" in the fencing-match—
disarming Laertes, and offering courteously his own foil in exchange
for the poisoned one—he rendered the scene utterly ridiculous by
killing the King a second time by making him drink the dregs of the
deadly wine after he had stabbed him. For the rest, the King was
dull, the Qufen colourless, and the Gravediggers witless. And here
let me observe that although we hear a great deal of the "equality"
of the Artists at the Français, the First Grave-digger being played
by COQUELIN CADET, and the Second ditto by a less distinguished
actor called ROGER, the name of the former was printed in large
letters four places higher up in the programme than bis colleague.
So much for ^Egalité" and " Fraternité " behind the footlights.
The audience were roused once or twice. The finale of the Ригу
Scene produced a great effect, and was rewarded with three or four
rounds of applause. Here M. MOTTNKT - SULLY actuallv used a
modern fan (it looked as if it had just been bought at the Grand
Magazin du Louvre at 3/. 75 c.) to conceal his features as he crept
up to the throne of his much-hated uncle. This fan he took from
Ophelia, who immediately produced another, of a different fashion,
with the dexterity of a prestidigitateur. This was the cleverest thing
she did during the whole piece, and argued that she was not such
a fool as she looked. Again the audience were aroused to some-
thing like enthusiasm when the fainting Hamlet, after assisting at
the funeral of Ophelia, refused to be comforted by his mother. The
allusion to "ma mère" was too much for the Parisians, and they
considered it " very fine." Once more the audience appreciated
the piece of business with the foils and " Laè'rte," to which I have
already alluded. But after? Nothing!
There were the usual calls customary on a première, but that
was all. I fancy the audience, had they seen Hamlet in English
played by our best Actors, would (could they have understood the
language) have thoroughly enjoyed it; but with a mutilated version
in feeble verse, played by the old stagers of the Théâtre Français,
they were, during three-fourths of the representation, simply bored.
They woke up at the situations, they applauded the sentiments,
but they had no chance of grasping the real meaning of the grandest
of our poets. Whatever gush may be written about French acting
by our home-made critics, I can confidently assert that a third-rate
English company would have played Hamlet better than the
Sociétaires and Pensionnaires of the "House of MOLIÈRE." And if
anyone doubts my word, let him go—and judge for himself.
CHARLES—YOUR FRIEND.

in such a case generally find it "manslaughter," and send a prisoner

opportunity they missed of exercising their precious privilege of
subjeotmff an unlucky man to the anxiety and expense of standing a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE LAY OF THE LOST CRITIC.
YES, Sir, you 're right; I have come
down. Thanks. Three of Irish
cold.
Well, like the fox who lost his tail,
I 've little to unfold.
Thank yon, I don't mind if Г do. My
dear, the same again.
—I was a Critic once, who lived on
"Chicken and Champagne"
You see me now, a Sandwich-man!
Me I who was once a scorner
Of Sisras's dramatised low life, of
peasant pride in WABITEB:
The author's skill, the actor's art, were
caviare to me,
A Boardman now—a Woodman once
who didn't spare^the Tree.
The'pallid playwright, sick with care,
would angle for a smile.
The actor, like a pricked balloon, would
sink his side awhile;
My pen blackmailed the wretched Pro's,
like levelled pistol's muzzle;
I had a price, and got it too. Law!
how I used to guzzle!
Whene'er I hear the captive cock that
from the area crows,
(For down our court they keep a lot to
trouble my repose,)
Whene'er I pass the bottle-shop, my
tears I scarce restrain,
They 'mind me of those bygone hours
of Chicken and Champagne.
I thought myself a power indeed. Nor
was 1 all to blame,
For men I scarcely knew by sight
would conjure with my name.
—" A great night at the Club to-night ; JACK BOFNDEH 's coming down ! "—
They called me JACK behind my back, and trembled at my frown.
Oh, happy days of pleasing toil, of feasting on the best,
When conscious pride of guerdon earned gave every meal a zest!
Loud was the laugh that ever met the oldest joke from me,
And mine the health that always went with rousing three times three!
And so the prosperous years sped on, till on an evil day
I spurned the Critic's easy throne, and thought to write a play.
I 'd prove to flattering crowds that still fresh laurels could be won,
And show poor playwrights how the thing ought really to be done.
And I would wed a chorister, a slender, fair-haired thing.
I thought that she might act—in time. (I knew she could not sing.)
I pitched upon a German farce to start my honest life,
Picked all the "plums" from all the parts, and wrote them for my wife.
***•*••
Gods! how they hissed and hooted! You could scarcely hear a word;
—The artistes turned in wrath on me, because they got "the bird."
And she, my destined bride, remarked, with irony abstruse,
"You've had so much of Chicken, that you ought to welcome Goote."
And so the spell was broken. Oh, what a fool was I
To risk the unassailed success of those who never try!
No more obsequious Managers besought me for a play,
And meanest mummers ceased to care a rap what I could say.
Then down and ever down I sunk; dropped out of all my Clubs;
And in a year or two I came to "pressing" round the "pubs."
But, venal still, I made a bit by penning spiteful "pars"
On those who had not half-a-crown when "whispered" at the bars.
But that is past—and here I am; and few things make me sore,
Save when at luncheon-time I chance to cass MILANO'S door,
And see the Drama's minor lights sail in in silk and satin;
—The pride of learning haunts me still—I curse in Greek and Latin.
Good-byOj Sir. Thank you kindly. It is time for me to go
To advertise FITZNOODLE'B play with measured tread and slow.
FITZXOODLE! whom I slated so, it turned his hair half-grey!
—And now I carry boards about to advertise his play!
Farewell, farewell! but this I tell to thee, thou stranger host—
He writeth best who writeth least, and yet you praiseth most.
He writeth best who findeth good to praise in great and small,
For fools who can't tell good from bad make game alike of all.

Colonel. But tell me are not the desertions enormous?

conduct. I cannot hear them "pooh-poohed "—they are most
sensible, and never-sufficiently-to-be-esteemed.
Colonel. And the Commander-in-Chief—why he is a civilian—
what-you-eall a Mr. SMITH!

Colonel. But the Duke is always attending to his gout or his deer-
shooting. Is it not so?
Lieutenant. A thousand million pardons, but I will not hear him
"pooh-poohed." He is a most amiable gentleman, and takes a great
deal of interest in the War Game.
Colonel. Does he not fear the rain, and always use an umbrella?
Lieutenant. Pardon! I cannot consent to hear his umbrella
"pooh-poohed." It is an article never-to-be-left-at-home-when-

Colonel. But were not the Infantry Regiments half-full of boys,
and the Cavalry about a third of their proper strength?

Colonel. Yes, I know. But how about discipline? Is it not true
that within a week of your visit there was a serious mutiny, in which
some three hundred men indulged in a free fight';
Lieutenant. That may be so. But, pardon me,—I must insist.
After having spent a whole afternoon—you understand, a whole

A WATER COURSE.
X.
Ascent of the Puy de Dome, and Grand Finale.
WE are preparing for final retirement, and
a wizened figure in black, like a rag-doll as
a pen-wiper, presents us with our little bill
for twenty-one days' washing, insists upon
giving us sweet-scented flowers and unripe
fruit, and then with her money in her pocket,
shows herself out of the room, saying with
plenty of bobs (and francs) and curtseys at the
door, "Salut, Mossieu' et Médame! Salut,
Médame et Mossieu!" and so ringing the
changes on this formula, she disappears. "We
both took a great fancy to this old lady, who
was full of chatter and gossip, but on subse-
quent consideration, Cousin JAHE begins to
question whether the work of the Blanchisseuse
is quite the most reasonable of the charges,
which as a rule are decidedly moderate at
Royat. Afterwards, in driving about, we come
upon the Grotto where the Nymphs wash and
pummel the linen. If the amount of iron in the
water is the same as that in the Source Eugénie
or César, then the work of the blanchisseuse is
an economy of time and labour, as in the Spring of the Grotto they
do both the washing and the ironing at the same moment.
Coming on to the roof of our hotel, after a long drive, I hear a
voice, exclaiming, "Hallo! What you here!"
Why is one Englishman always utterly astonished to meet another
Englishman, and a friend, anywhere abroad? Wherever they
meet it is " Hallo, old fellow! what on earth brings you here?" or,
"Who 'd ha' thought p' seeing you here ?"—as if you had taken an
unfair advantage of him somehow, or as if your presence anywhere
was, in itself, a suspicious circumstance, and demanded instant
explanation. In this case it is a Scotch friend, who has arrived
for the benefit of his health. He is accompanied by another friend,
also a North Briton, who has come to see him safely started in the
Water Course, along which I have been sailing pleasantly enough;
and after that he intends to return to the Highlands, where, at the
sporting season, his heart naturally is and "not here ;" his heart,
according to the old song, being engaged in "Chasing the wild
deer, the (something, I forget what) and the roe. Oh! my heart 's
in the Highlands wherever I go." This patriotic sportsman is the
Chieftain of a Clan, at the sound of whose pibroch (I am not sure of
my Scotch terms, and do not venture them in his presence) a
thousand stalwart Highlanders, kilted and claymor'd, spring from the
heather, and ¡shout something equivalent to "0 ieroe!" and then
execute wild .dances by torchlight, in celebration of having killed
'Salut, Moseieu' et
Mídame!"

The Nymphs of the Grotto.
something or other on four legs, which must be considerably larger
than a hare. I mention four legs, because I do not think they have
any midnight revels after killing a sixteen-pound salmon.
However, I admit my ignorance of Highland customs, and am glad
to be instructed. Delighted also to partake of the savoury venison.
The Chieftain, who, with his friend the MclNVAiiD, dines with us
to-night in the talle à manger, where the number of guests is daily
diminishing, expresses his delight with Royat, at finding it so like
Scotland. As a Chieftain who would have bis foot on nis native
heath if he could, he is burning to climb a mountain, to ascend the
steep and craggy rocks, and bound lightly from point to point like a
gay chamois. "Can we not,"—he suggests, considerately turning
towards the MclN VALED,—" before you begin your baths and drinks,
can we not ascend the Puy de Dôme?"
Yes. Why not? Nothing more simple. Order a carriage; drive
over there to-morrow morning; "take luncheon with us," says the
Mel»VALID. "By all means." returns the Chieftain, "and make the
ascent. '' Though disliking climbings, and detesting, in a general way,
going up any high places, whether a belfry, a tower, or a mountain
merely for the sake of a view, I cannot refuse their friendly offer of
a seat in the carriage and a share of the lunch. So I accept. The
M i 1 x VA u n has a guide-book, likewise the Chieftain has one. I tell
them that I have a book which will be of service to me as a beginner
in the act of going up mountains, but not to them as experts.
"What is it?" "Well—it is only a Grammar; it is, in fact,
Cardinal NEWMAN'S Grammar of Assent."
Thus lightheartedly I prepare for the dangers of the morrow. I
dismiss the Excursion in two pictures which present a fair idea of the

hardy mountaineers didn't like it. The Chieftain sat behind, and

A Royat-1 Ascent.
Sappy Thought.—" I say, eupposo we meet anything coming down!!"
his chances of escape, in case of an accident, were somewhat better
than ours in front, though we were all three boxed into the seats,
and aprons tightly fixed. One comforting thought was, "How many
have Ъееп up here before, and yet lived to tell the tale!" Bat,
onl consideration, such a theory could only be supported by our
having implicit faith in the word of anyone who told us that he had
made the ascent.
Unlike Box and Cox we did not meet anyone " Coming up-stairs,
as we were going down, or going down-stairs as we were coming up.
And it was fortunate for us that we didn't. When we reached the top
there was an Observatory, where we made several observations,—
strong ones too, some of them, on tumbling up and down the stairs.
Here the seamanlike Observer pointed out to us all that was to be
seen, and that didn't require pointing out, and told us of a great deal
more, including " Jerusalem and Madagascar, and North and South
Ameriky," which would have been plainly visible to the naked eye
had we only been up here yesterday, or the day before, or in fact at
any time except the very day we_ had selected. We saw the French
soldiers practising firing in the fields below—and that was all.
We had lunch previous to the ascent, which proceeding we subse-
quently decided was a mistake; and the Chieftain chatted freely and
pleasantly with the peasants on our return. The MC!NVALID was
deeply interested in their habits and customs, ami,—-his idea as to the
dinner-hour being founded on the practice of the London season,—he
wished to know what time they dined, and when they breakfasted,
and was much exercised on being informed by the chatty matron, that
they had dinner at eleven in the morning, and "soup" at about six in
or so in the evening.
"Et dites donc, Madame, s'il vous plaît," says he, regarding the
mother of the family with the deepest interest, "ne prenez-vous pat
du thé à cingue- heures alors?"
He couldn't understand that at the foot of the Puy de Dôme, within
reach of an Observatory, not more than a mile off perpendicularly,
and within fifteen miles of Royat, this good lady should not have her
"day," and her "five o'clock tea."

It quite saddened him to think to what a. state of ignorance a

it began to mizzle, and fog swept over the heather, and then both
the North Britons revived.
"It is like Scotland!" cried the Chieftain, beaming with pleasure
as they both wrapped their plaidies about them, and revelled in water-
proofs.
On our arrival at the hotel, a gigantic retainer, one of the Chief-
tain's Highland Body Guard, or Six-feet-three-Highlander, opens
the carriage-door. Where has DONALD been? He has just been up
"what they call in these parts a mountain, but it 's пае better than
a hillock, ye ken, in Scotland."
"You got a good view, eh?" inquires the Chieftain.
DONALD considers a second or two before answering, and then
replies,—
Aweel, when I got oop to the top o' the thing they ça* a moun-
tain"
"What did you see?" asks the Chieftain, cutting in quickly.
"Aweel," answers DOXALD, looking a bit puzzled, "Ijust saw a
Frenchman." And this seemed to have impressed the Highlander
more than anything in the whole course of his journey abroad.
_ The next morning we bid Dr. HEM good-bye; Cousin JANE de-

"Yon won t feel the benefit of the place all at once," says Dr.
REM. He is quite right—I don't. Perhaps I am getting it in bits,
and I am what is expressively termed " mending."
I have seen the process of "mending." Even with the best house-
wife it 's a slow business. But still, for anœmic persons who are over-
worked and weary, it would be difficult to .find a better (and, mind
you, a more moderate) p_lace than Royat, with its vineyards, its
lovely country, its magnificent air, its pine-forests, its picturesque
environs, its amusements (they 've stopped the baccarat and petits
chevaux), its rides, drives, and walks, its douches of all sorts, and, in
a general way, its Water Course.
RATHEB "A QUEER Crss."—"Mr. SMITH'S disapprobation," as
the Admiralty and Horse Guards Gazette, calls the Secretary of
State for War's condemnation "conveyed to all concerned," in the
presentation of colours to the Royal Irish Regiment, will probably
cause some stir in "Service circles." From Sir RALPH THOMPSON'S
letter to that well-known military critic, "the Rev. Dr. BADENOCH,"
it appears that the Ex " Lord of the QUEEN'S Navee," is about "to
examine into the whole question," which suggests that Mr. SMITH
may have some intention of taking the affair entirely into his own
hands, and for the future blessing the colours himself. This would
be most unwise, as the proceeding would be sure to increase the
friction already unhappily existing between the War Office and the
Horse Guards. He had far better leave the matter to the Duke of
CAMBRIDGE who (especially when anything goes wrong at an inspec-
tion) is an admirable judge of the kind of benediction best suited to
the requirements of the British Army.

quier— CLABKSON was his name? Think so. However, Secretary
will see about that. While he 's gone, will think what name I shall
take, and then I can settle how I shall make up. "Make up!"

be out of place for a Chancellor of the Exchequer, by the way.
"Only a wicked wag " would say such a thing as that; yet at Dart-
ford I got some laughs for a quotation or two in that line. No—
not GLADSTONE'S name. "GUPPY?" Let me see—"young man of
the name of GUPPT." No—" GUPPY" would stick to me afterwards.

Published at Dartford—suitable spot '—
Full of sensation hot-and-hot,
Telling; how this burglar bold
Broke into the Liberal hold,
After the swag he had long forsworn,
Cooked his nose at in cutting scorn.

Have their likes and their dislikes,1
And if ever a big strong-box
Safe appeared, with its bars and locks,
Safe from the jemmy of modern Jack,
This was it. Such a crib to crack
No one ever expected Aim,
Though acknowledged a burgling limb.
No one? Well, we will say but few,
Shrewd observers—just one or two,
Had an idea that this burgling wag
Coveted most this identical swag.
So, when the House is hushed and lone,
Most of its usual guardians gone,
Whilst the few remaining are fast asleep,
What does young Sheppard but quietly creep,
With hintern dark and skeleton-keys,
And professional jemmy, as sly as you please;
And In! the Liberal strong-box wide,
And Jack the master of all inside!
Horrible, isn't it? Murder! Police!
Jim't an Old Gentleman slumber in peace,
After so tiring and trying a time.
Without the shock of this scandalous criou.
Awful precocious depravity this!
Never a bit of the swag does he miss;
Out he bundles them, one by one.—
Will the young vagabond never have done?
All the Old Gentleman's treasures lie.
Under the urchin's irreverent eye,
Tossed pell-mell. There are documents there,
Pet possessions and manuscripts rare;
Pride of the burgled old boy and his friends.

possible policies, and even speaks with ap-
proval of the conduct of General KVULIIAit--.

PHEASANT PLEASANTRY.
OUR SPORTIVE ARTIST, D. CHAMBO, JUN., SAYS THAT THE UNFA-
VOURABLE REPORTS FROM THE BREEDING DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN
GREATLY EXAGGERATED. NOTWITHSTANDING THE LATE PREVALENCE
OF "GAPES," THERE IS A FAIR SUPPLY OF "LONG TALKS."
COUNTRY COUSINS—PERSONALLY CONDUCTED.
MY DEAR MB. PUNCH,
I HAVE to return you my grateful thanks for allowing me
to have had the delightful duty of escorting your Cousins from the
Country round the sights of Town, as it. has given me an opportunity
of renewing several most pleasing memories. Thus I have once more
seen Westminster Abbey (now open to the Public free of charge and
vergers on Mondays and Tuesdays) and the Tower, and have also
"done" Kew Gardens, Hampton Court (where we got a very ad-
mirable meal at the "Mitre "), Gravesend (new line there, with
cheap trains at half-a-crown First Return, L. C. & D. E.). and the
South Kensington Museum. Your relatives seemed greatly pleased
with all these delightful sights, and I have no doubt would have
been glad to have repeated them, had not your welcome packet of
tickets arrived in time to furnish an object for the exploration of
fresh places of amusement.
Our first visit after this thoughtful gift was to the Albert Palace,
a very fine institution, adjoining Battersea Park. I believe it was
originated by Alderman Sir BOBERT GARDEN, who has left, in the
illuminated grounds and al fresco entertainments, evidences of that
gaiety of temperament which has justly earned for him the festive
title of '' the most jovial Citizen in London." The worthy and mirth-
promoting Magistrate has been succeeded in the Management by Mr.
WILLIAM HOLLAND, a gentleman who, I am told, is known amongst
his intimates as ''the People's Caterer." Certainly, when we
entered the establishment there was no lack of recreations. We
assisted at a most excellent Circus, wherein a very talented damsel,
with long yellow hair, balanced herself on a slack wire, and per-
formed various feats with metal balls. This obliging individual was
followed by a jockey who rode without a saddle, eight ladies and
gentlemen who danced a quadrille on horseback in the most courteous
manner imaginable, and many other vastly entertaining perform-
ances. Besides the Circus, Mr. HOLLAND had prevailed upon a very
large number of Cats, and a Giant Baby (" pronounced by members
of the Medical Profession the Wonder of the World"—see Pro-
gramme), to exhibit themselves to an audience as remarkable for its
numbers as its enthusiasm. There were also some extremely intelligent
Fleas (one, I fear, was suffering from a slight cough), a Diorama, a
Marionette Theatre, and " LOTTINA, the Beautiful Sylph of the Air."
This last, a most pleasing female, was said, by the Programme, to be
patronised by Lieut.-Colonel THORNEYCROFT, the Earl of ROSEBEBY,
the Duke of EDDTBUBGH, and others.
After leaving Battersea we visited the Exhibition of the Photo-
graphic Society of Great Britain, and absolutely revelled in its rol-
licking contente. I can scarcely imagine any grander display of
Art, although I was told by one of your Cousins that it was scarcely
so interesting as a previous display of a year or two ago, when a large
autotype of three boys artistically grouped in an arm-chair had been
the centre of attraction. The great success of some of the sun-pictures
displayed at this artistic exhibition, made us all hope very earnestly
that such eminent painters as Mr. MABCUS STONE, Mi. GEOBGE
CBTTIKSHAIÍK, Jnn., and M. TISSOT, would some day be encouraged to
finally discard their palettes in favour of their cameras. Leaving
Pall Mall East, we went to the Royal Westminster Aquarium, where
we found Professor LEON taming horses somewhat after the fashion
of Mr. RABEY. The experiments were highly diverting, and would
no doubt have held us spell-bound for hours, ä not for days, had we
not wished to see the V anishing Lady disappear at the Egyptian
Hall under the immediate personal superintendence of Mr. BERTKAM.
The self-abnegating gentlewoman who was induced to thoroughly
efface herself for the convenience of visitors, was a Madam PATBICE,
who by her name it will be seen conclusively established her foreign
nationality.
We had now exhausted your tickets with the exception of two—
the first entitling us to a view of the Constitutional Club, the second
allowing us to inspect the Dairy Show. We were amazed at the
splendour of the cercle invented by that most gallant of veteran
warriors, Lieutenant-Colonel EDIS of the Artist Rifte Volunteer Corps.
The "hero of a hundred sites," (the dashing officer is not only a
soldier, but an architect) had made a feature of the electric lighting,
which certainly was of excellent elevation, and equal, if not superior
to oil or gas. The furniture too was of most admirable quality,
having been supplied from his own establishment by a prominent
member of the Committee. Now that the Constitutional is opened
for the admission of members, I shall not be surprised to hear of the
total collapse of White's, the. Junior Garrick, the Marlborough, the
Grafton, Boodle's, the Greenroom and others, with equal claims to
the highest social distinction.
We now wended our weary way to the Agricultural Hall, Islington,
(which is not to be compared with "Olympia," the coming—from
Paris—hippodrome of West Kensington) and were simply amazed
at the magnificent display of cheese, in the Dairy Show. The butter
too was a most impressive sight, and reminded some of our party of
the weird beauties of the far North, and others of HUDSON'S establish-
ment under the shadow of St. Paul's.
Having shown your entertaining relatives the above instructive
sights, the youngest of their party volunteered to take me in hand,
and offered to " put me up to a thing or two." Gratefully accepting
his invitation, I dined at FRANCATELLI'S, visited the Alhambra and
the "Colinderies," and finished up with ROMANO'S and the Cavour.
The next morning, if I ignore a splitting headache and a settled
melancholy, I never felt better in my life.
Believe me, dearer. Punch, most gratefully,
A PERAMBULATING PLEASUBE-SEEKEB.
THE AUSTRALIANS' FAREWELL.
[Most of the members of the Australian Cricket Team which has been
playing here this year left last week for home.]
FAREWELL to the land which once glowed with our glory!
Good-bye to the fields which once rang with our fame!
'Tis faded, that fame, and that page in our story
Turned o'er, and the next one reads not quite the same.
We have played against teams that have beaten us badly,
Have oft had to own that the best side had won.
The season is o'er, and our team departs sadly,
Not, not quite the team that past wonders had done.
Farewell to thee, England! We left them behind us,
Those heroes who rivalled the pick of thy land.
The scores of those matches serve but to remind us
Of MURDOCH—the touch of his strong (vanished) hand;
Of PERCY MCDONNEL, who beat your best bowlin',
Of BANNERMAN brave, with defence like a rock;
Of artful old BOYLE, with the game his whole soul in,
Of MASSIE the mighty, who never would " block."
Ah, SPOFFOHTH! He knew not our depth of disaster,
Who dealt that unkindest cut-orer of all.
'Tis true you have bowled, but the hand of the master
Has ne'er been the same in command of the ball.
Oh, BLACKHAM! your hands must have lost half their cunning,
Now never too sure of a " stump" or a "catch ";
And BKUCE, Sir! your bowling at home was thought "stunning,"
How is it you have not " come off" in a match?
Ay, JONES may have scored, and GEOBGE GIFFEN done wonders,
And PALMER and SCOTT may have "laid on the wood";
But why in the field such a number of blunders?
Why " rots," that our forerunners ever withstood?
Farewell to thee, England! Bat, on our next visit,
You '11 see our old Champions who triumphed before.
For the present you need not much wonder why is it
We boast of those once-vaunted " ashes" no more!
ABTISTIC.—It is understood that Mr. MILLAIS, the painter of
"Chill October," is hotly—very hotly—indeed, in fact 90° in the
shadily—at work upon a companion picture, a subject suggested by
the recent tropical autumnal weather. It will be a landscape with
figures, the landscape broiling in the full blaze of a lingering but
potent Phoebus, the figures aU at perspiration point. The title of the
picture will be " October with the Chill off."
THE introduction of WOLFE TONE into Mr. GLADSTONE'S corre-
spondence on Ireland sounds like a tone of disloyalty which the
Ex-Premier would be the first to disavow. But even a semi-Tone
of this Wolfish sort would have been a note of disaffection; and
Mr. GLADSTONE doesn't want this sort of thing " to give a tone" to
his speeches or writings.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO, WITHIN THE LAST TEN DAYS, ABROAD, HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN FOR LORD RANDOLPH CHURCHILL
THE ANATOMY OF SHOOTING.
MEN WE NEVER MEET.
1. THE man who makes no excuses for
shooting badly; such as—1. The light was
iu his eyes; 2. He was bilious; 3. There
was something wrong with his cartridges;
4. Too many cigars the night before; 5.
Some particular eatable or drinkable taken
the night before; 6. Or that morning;
7. He was afraid of hitting that beater;
8. We were walking too fast; 9. He hadn't
got his eye in; 10. Or his eye was out;
11. He didn't think it was his bird: 12. It
was too far off; 13. He always thought there
was something the matter with that gun.
2. The man whose dog hasn't a good nose.
3. The man who can't "shoot a bit some-
times."
4. The 'man who hasn't some particular
theory as to—1. The very best gun; 2. Car-
tridges; 3. Charges of powder and shot; 4.
Best tipple to shoot on; 5. Best sort of boots;
6. (jailers; 7. And equipment generally.
5. The man who doesn't change the said
theory every season.
6. The man who hasn't sometimes said .he
couldn't shoot after lunch.
7. Or that he could shoot better after
lunch.
8. The man who on your remarking that
your friend GEORGE LAKE is a good shot,
doesn't answer that you should see BILLY
MOUNTAIN (or someone else) and then you
would know what shooting really was.
9. The man who hasn't a friend who
"can't hit a haystack."
10. The friend who owns it.
11. The man who doesn't like to be con-
sidered a good shot.
12. The man who, being a bad shot,
doesn't comfort himself by thinking he
knows a worse.
13. The man who hasn't made a longer
shot than anyone in the company.
14. The man who, having made it, doesn't
tell the story.
15. And who, having told the story, doesn't
tell it more than once.
Finally, Mr. Punch is never likely to
meet the man who, having read the above,
will not own that it is strictly true of those
who pursue the pleasant pastime of shooting
when, as the eminent BURTON puts it, "they
have leisure from public cares and busi-
nesses."
"WHAT и A PANSLAVISTA'—Well, yon
just ask a Maid-of-All-Work in a lodging-
house—she '11 explain.
BLACK AS A COLLIER.
Ma. PUNCH, remembering his special family
connection with Italy—though it is a common
error to suppose that he is of purely Italian,
any more than he is of purely Indian, origin,
his glorious ancestral records going back to a
time when the protoplasms of evolutionists
were uncommonly jelly-fishy—was particu-
larly delighted at seeing in the Times of
Saturday last, a Correspondent signing him-
self " ANGLO-ITALIAN," indignantly yet cour-
teously repelling the odious charge brought
against Italian gentlemen by Miss COLLIER,
in her book " Our Home by the Adriatic," a
charge which, in the course of its review, the
Times had admitted without comment,'in this
objectionable form,—"Italian gentlemen do
not hesitate to beat the female members of
the family."
Mr. Punch not unmindful of certain sad
passages in the domestic history of his own
family,—to which he alludes with poignant
feelings of regret, though it is but fair to say
that there were faults on both sides,—was
thunderstruck at seeing such a statement in
our leading journal remaining for one whole
week uncontradicted. If an educated Eng-
lish lady can say such things of Italians, how
can we be surprised when a certain class of
French writers still declare that the English
sell their wives at Smithfield.
Italian chivalry is made to look very black
under the touch of a COLLIER,—in fact the
charge itself is rather suggestive of the habits
and customs, not of the South, but of a
Northern English Colliery.
AT the Church Congress last week there
was, beside " Cheers," a considerable amount
of " Dissent." This speaks well for the broad
views of the Church Congress.
THE French Figaro, last week, had one of
the inevitable articles on L'Anglais à Paris.
True, there is such a person as the Anglais
pour rire—" who 's a deniging of it ?"—but
the fact is that " Too many Cooks spoil the
Continent."
Mus. RAM visited a Ritualistic Church one
day, and said the smell was just the same as
in the churches abroad after some service
when they 'd been burning insects.
WHAT is "THE HESSIAN FLY?"—Is it a
new sort of cab? If so, how much an hour?
Is it provided with a Hessian ." boot" for
luggage?
INGOLD3BY IMPROVED.
IN consequence of recent revelations con-
cerning the emphatically "fishy" state of
the mains of the East London Waterworks,
a modified version of "The Knight and the
Lady" is in preparation, brought up to
date and adapted to the habitat of the
modern eel. The concluding passage in
which Lady Jane, the tall and slim, recon-
signs her drowned lord to the pond, in the
honourable and useful capacity of an "eel-
trap," will now run as follows :—
"Eels a many

DRUKIOLANUS IN FOEO. — Mr. AUGUSTUS
HARRIS has been summoning the Vestry of
St. Martin's-in- the-Fields, who have re-
fused to remove the dust from Drury Lane
Theatre on the plea that they regarded it
as "trade-sweepings," which they declined
to cart away unless paid at the rate of six
shillings a load for the service. Unless Mr.
HARRIS has been chopping up his scenery,
properties, box-fittings, or benches, and con-
signing them to his dust-bin, it is not easy
to see how the combative Vestry could prove
their point. And indeed they failed to do
so, for, on samples being produced in Court,
and these not containing even any unre-
turned MSS. left at the stage-door, the Magis-
trate, Mr. BRIDGE, after inspecting them,
decided that they were only "sweepings
from a theatre," and not "trade refuse,"
and that the accumulated dust must be re-
moved accordingly. The Vestry, however,
not regarding Mr. BRIDGE as that golden
one by which they might retire gracefully
from the contest, have given notice of an
appeal, the result of which Mr. HARKIS, who
is said at least to be bringing down the dust
at the exchequer in the front of his House,
may probably await with all confidence.
VERY ALARMING INTELLIGENCE. — It has
been generally stated in the papers that
"Mr. PARNELL has made arrangements to
spend the winter in the South of France, and
will not return till the opening of Parlia-
ment." This is startling for us in the North.
Why doesn't he come and live quietly among
us in London, and then we should have been
pretty safe during the winter P

SQUARING ALL ROUND.
Two exceedingly pleasant statements were made at the late Con-
cress of Railway Servants. The first is, that, owing to the present
complicated system of railway signalling, it is quite impossible for
signalmen to avoid making mistakes. The second is, that, when they
do make these inevitable mistakes, it is their practice to avoid being
reported by "squaring" the engine-drivers who detect them. The
signalman's argument, expressed in the vernacular, doubtless is,
"If I don't 'square' the engine-driver, the engine-driver will
'round on ' me." Fine subject for an allegorical design to adorn the
walls of the Railway Servants' Congress :—" Sleepy Signalman
trying to Square a Circle—of wide-awake Engine-Drivers.
Meanwhile, of the consequences of threatened " rounding," and
the actual "squaring" the public has to run the risk, and of ten,
it is to be feared, to suffer the effects. The public will probably
come to the conclusion that this kind of "squaring" is not "on the
square." The sooner it takes sharp measures to impress that con-
clusion, and its legitimate inferences, upon the mind—or perhaps
one should rather say the pockets—of the Railway Companies, the
better for its own interests. It is ingenuously admitted that a sug-
gestion that " pqnaring" should be put a stop to, "did not find much
favour with the Congress." This naïve announcement will naturally
raise the indignant ire of the railway-traveller.
But perhaps, after all, it is not the poorly paid victims of excess-
ively long hours, and a complicated system of signalling, who
should be attacked, but rather the complacent monopolists, who are
responsible for the long hours and the complexity. À system which
results in overworked drudges continually putting people's lives in
horrible danger, and then "squaring" other overworked drudges,
in order to escape detection, is self-condemned, and must be sharply
inquired into. There is a great deal too much of this nefarious
"squaring" going on all round us nowadays; and he is a true
friend of the public who ruthlessly exposes it wherever found.
MRS. RAM says it is delightful to roam out of an evening in the
country fi-lds, end hear the sheep-bells tingling.
A NEW VERSION OF AN OLD STORY..
( Written for translation into Russian,)
THE General travelled through the fields until he met some reapers.
He offered them gold, and told them to say that the whole country
belonged to the CZAB.
They accepted the money, and there was a slight tremor in their
left eyes.
Then the gallant diplomatist entered a town. He addressed the
citizens, and informed them that if they desired to see their grievances
redressed, they must appeal to the CZAR.
Again there was a slight trembling of their sinister eyelids.
Once more "he urged on his wild career," and came across the
Army.
"My Brothers!" he exclaimed, "your Master is mine, and mine
yours. He is the most powerful in the world. Be good enough to
shout for him!"
But still the eyes winked in the familiar, too familiar fashion, and
the felf-appointed Envoy called them all together.
"Now, Nobles, Citizens, and Army, take your time from me," cried
the General. "Shout ' Long live the CZAB!'"
But everybody laughed, and then there was a resounding cry of
"Flourish BulgariaV'
And as this was not exactly what he expected, the General sulked,
and came to the conclusion that he had had his labour for nothing.
Moral.—It is not every brute who, like Puss in Soots, can secure
respect and popularity for a Marquis of Caraibas!
THE undefeated P. M. G. obtained from different actors three
opinions as to the effect of the long runs on their health. Mr. GROS-
SMiTH evaded the question (so like him), and tortuously replied that
he only felt the effect on the first night. Evidently he has experi-
enced the result of a long run on his head, for he couldn't nave
managed it on his Sim-Tappertitian legs. By the way, how admi-
rably " G. G." could make up for Sim Tappertit. It doesn't matter
what may happen to actors, since, as a nue, they are pretty sure to
come right " in the long run."

THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.
FEOM "Мк. SPENCER." ВегНщ Monday,

EAR TOBY,
I mno your letter on going
back to the Kaiserhoff, after see-
ing 11 K.HIIKUT. (Of coarse I don't
mean our HERBERT. Strange,
isn't it, that there should be two
Grand Old Men, one in Germany
and one in England, and both
with sons named HERBERT ?) I
am delighted with what you tell
me of the stir my mysterious dis-
appearance has made. "Such
larks!" as Joe Qargery said to
Pip. I quite understand that, as
you вау, since the disappearance
of the late Mr. LEFBOT there has
been no such sensation in London.
The fact is, I was getting a little
bored at the Treasury. I wanted a diversion. One cannot, in present circum-
stances, race across Westminster Bridge, as I once did, what time the clock
struck the quarters and midnight. Nor can I very well go making cart-wheels
aloDç the pavement in Pall Mall. Must do something; so I thought of this,
and it has answered all my expectations. Most amusing to read the German
papers, or rather to get TRAPFORD to translate them for me.
I have been to Varzin, and had a couple of hours' chat with В ISM utnr. He 's
:i very able man, of course; but a little lacking in humour. He doesn't see
my fun in my going about under an alias. "Ten thousand thunders!" he
growled, looking down on me with a fearful scowl, "why on earth couldn't you
зоте here in your own name? What do you mean by dodging from railway
itation to railway station, disguised in a big cloak, as if you had stolen a watch
sr murdered a man, and feared the police were after you?" Then he lapsed
Ato German, and 1 lost the thread of his conversation, but rather guessed it
was not complimentary.
This was not a favourable opening to the conversation, but we presently got
m a little better. I promised BISMARCK I would back him up. Told him
JLADSTONE was finally played out, and that I would keep SALISBURY straight.
3ut he didn't seem so gratified as I had expected. Wanted to know whether
'. was sure of carrying the consent of the House of Commons, and what would
ÏARTINGTON say, and how far would CHAMBERLAIN keep in step with me? He
toesn't seem half so easy to get over as the Markiss. Once 1 tried a little
rallying with him. Blazed out upon him like I do upon Grand CROSS. Seriously,
TOBY, dear boy, I thought he would have taken me up and put me out of the
nndow. So hastened to explain that it was only my fun; whereat he again
apsed into the German language, which I think very effective for saying bad
vijrds in.
Of course I tell you all this in confidence. What I want Europe, and more
larticularly the Electors of South Paddington to understand is, that I 'm
loving in a mysterious but most potent way—that I and BISMARCK, in secret
ouncil, in which I take the leading part, are arranging the affairs of Europe,
nd that we will make Emperors and Sovereigns generally sit up. DISRAELI
ras a moderately shrewd man. He saw the advantage of taking a personal
art in the direction of foreign affairs. But then he went to Berlin in common-
lace fashion, with an ordinary COOK'S ticket, the time of his departure from
ipndon and the hour of his arrival in Berlin openly stated. But my flight by
ight, the total disappearance of Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL in London, and
lie mysterious movements of Mr. SPENCER in Berlin, form, I flatter myself,
uite a new thing.
I think as I am here I may as well make the round of
the Capitals, and settle matters generally. A little over-
awing might do Russia good. Austria is inclined to be
flighty, and as for France the government of the Republic
must be made to understand that a new PITT has come
to the front in English politics. It 's all very novel and
very exciting, and as I said before "such larks I" I
send you in cypher, as agreed, my address. Be careful
to post your letter yourself and see that you are not
watched. MATTHEWS is equal to anything, and knowing
that we are likely to be in correspondence, it is quite
possible that you are under surveillance.
Ever yours faithfully,
RANDOLPH SPENCER.
ALL ABROAD.
THE following specimen extract, taken from the
Travelling Conversation Boob, compiled in French,
German, Greek, and Arabic, for the use of Mr. CHAMBER-
LAIN during his projected European tour, by the accom-
glished Ex-Detective who is accompanying him, shows
ow judiciously the linguistic necessities of the distin-
guished Liberal - Unionist have been provided for.
Subjoined is a page, headed, "ON A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"
that furnishes a good idea of the rest of the text. It
proceeds as under :—
Are you sure that Mr. GLADSTONE is not travelling
incognito by this train?
Is the foreign-looking gentleman, with a fur-collar,
seated in the corner of the carriage, а Ъопа fide passenger,
or an Irish Nationalist in disguise?
Is my life safe in this compartment?
Let us ask the Ex-Detective, whom I have brought with
me, and who is seated in the next compartment, for in-
formation on the subject.
Who is that on the platform, with a gardenia in his
button-hole and an eye-glass in his eye, apeing my
manners, in a suit of my own clothes? Can it be RAN-
DOLPH CHUHCHILL, playing me a practical joke ? _
This stuffy second-class railway-carriage reminds me
very much of the atmosphere of the House in August.
It will, however, add to my Parliamentary experience
to study the country, as we pass along, from the window.
The land on each side of the line, to judge from the
occasional artificial divisions that meet the eye, appears
to me to be disposed of in allotments.
I have seen a great many acres, but have not yet come
across a single cow.
Ha! here is one acre containing seventeen cows.
I think, if I point it out to him, the sight will be
pleasing to JESSE COLLINGS.
But I must discuss the subject of Free Education with
this Station Master.
It is strange that neither of these two gendarmes has
ever heard of Local Self-Government.
Ha! here we are arrived at the end of our journey, and
this crowd is evidently waiting to receive me respectfully.
It is curious, though, that the luggage-porter appears
never to have heard of Birmingham and the Caucus.
If I take this fly, harnessed to two execrable screws,
will it not render my entry somewhat symbolical?
Never mind; I will make the head-waiter thoroughly
acquainted with the present position and prospects of the
Liberal-Unionist Party, and fully explain to him^the
peculiar nature of my relations with it.
But here is the Er-Detective with a bed-candle,
suggesting that perhaps I had better retire to rest.
Randolph the Radical.
IT tries your loyal Liberal's composure,
To see Lord CHURCHILL going for the Closure;
lint before him leal Rads must veil their brows,
Who promises six acres and two cows!
SACRED MUSIC AT THE PROMENADE CONCERTS,—Wby
not? Why shouldn't an Oratorio become an 'Arry-torio?
Mr. FREEMAN THOMAS announces that in consequence of
the success of The Messiah, he will now give Elijah.
Whatever happens, in this Oratorio there must always be
a very big Profit.
MRS. RAM says, that lately she has been in a part of the
country, where she was awfully bitten by the Midgets.

A CUBE FOE GAIETY.
MY БЕЛИ Мк. PUNCH,
FEELING that my recent _ visit to the Exhibition of the
Photographic Society of Great Britain had caused nervous exhaustion
from over excitement, I consulted my Doctor, who ordered me what
I may term a " travelling sedative."
"My dear Sir," he said, alter feeling my pulse, "there is no donht
that you have been living too fast, and that the proper thing to do is
to look in at the Fine Arts Exhibition at Folkestone for an hour or
so. If you do not feel immediate relief, I would advise crossing over
to Boulogne on a particularly rough day, and staying for a short time
in that favourite watering-place out of the season.
Thanking my medical adviser for his kindness, I hurried off to
Folkestone, leaving London at eight in the morning (thus, at my very-
door, commencing nis treatment, as the anxiety of procuring a cab
at so early an hour, was in itself in the spirit of his prescription) and
was soon in the temporary home of the Fine Arts. I was doomed to
disappointment. So far from finding the display calming to my
nerves, I became deeply interested in the many beautiful objects,
and renewed, nay, increased the excitement I experienced in Pal]
Mall East.
So tearing myself away from the Folkestone Exhibition, with its
thousands of treasures, I betook myself to the Lees, and to my great
satisfaction discovered that the weather forecast "squally — in
places a gale" was amply justified, by the condition of the ocean.
The sea was dashing over the end of the pier, and the fishermen1!
smacks were dancing about in the most eccentric fashion. In a word
those who desired to cross the Channel, were sure to have what is
known OR a very "dusty passage." Delighted at this pleasant
prospect, I went down to the sea-shore, and was soon on board thai
excellent steamer the Louite Dagmar.
Nothing could have been better than what followed. The boat
rolled and plunged, and soon nearly everyone of the crew, after
lending his waterproofs, was busily engaged in attending to thai
peculiar requirement of the passengers, usually supposed to be the
exclusive care of the steward. But I am sorry to say, that by the
mistaken kindness of an official before starting, I had been placed it
a chair in such an advantageous position, that I did not, in spite o:
being a bad sailor, feel the motion of the vessel sufficiently, ant
therefore reached Boulogne in fairly good spirits. Knowing hoy
important it wa» to me to encourage a calming melancholy, '.
envied the fate of a jaunty gentleman in a felt helmet, who had come
on board with a demeanour suggestive of utter indifference to the
condition of the elements. When I first saw him he was holding two
hard captain's biscuits in one hand, and a glass of stout in the other
evidently believing that in these simple articles of food he possess»
an infallible remedy for sea-sickness. Ten minutes later I again
looked at him, and noticed that he had dropped the biscuits on the
deck, had relinquished the glass, and was gazing in a stony manner
at a sailor who was bending over him full of tip-suggesting sympathy
Later still I saw a person with an orange-coloured face with chocolat
eye-balls, stretched at full length near a broken chair. At first '.
did not recognise the distorted features of this poor wretch, althongl
they seemed familiar to mp, however, when, at the invitation of the
Steward, the unhappy sufferer commenced searching for his ticke
VOL. xoi.
eebly under the shapeless mass of a crushed felt helmet, I felt sure
hat I was looking on all that remained of the jaunty passenger who
i;ul been во full of hope and confidence in biscuits and stout a long,
a very long, two hours before.
On landing, we found the train from Paris was standing beside the
.uay, and it was interesting to note how eagerly the passengers
Sound for Folkestone scanned our expressive countenances. As the
gentleman with the saffron face, chocolate-coloured eye-balls, and
¡rushed felt hat appeared from the gangway, a thrill of horror ran
ike a wave along the expectant voyageurs.
Once arrived in my capital hotel (with a name similar to that of
me of the most celebrated of Parisian hostelries) in the Rue Victor
lugo, I was met with the most cheering intelligence. The bathing
tad ceased, the theatre had not yet opened, and the Casino was
leserted. "There was nothing doing, and not a soul m the place."
[his was scarcely an exaggeration. I went to the old Etabfasement.
where "The last Grand Concert of the Season" was announced. I
intered. All that remained of the Cercle and the "little horses"
was the negro page; the " Exhibition of Pictures" was about to be
removed to supply the prizes for the " Tombola " ; and the Orchestra
the makers of the " Grand Concert") were gathered together in a
small room, playing (a dozen strong) to three spectators!
I walked through the deserted streets, finding house after house
"À louer," and ended my promenade by approaching one of the
nost "lively" of hotels, bearing an affiche announcing that it was
mmediately to he sold by auction.
For three days it rained hard, and on the fourth I felt that the
)ver-excitement caused by my visit to the Photographic Exhibition
lad all but vanished. Boulogne at this moment may be safely
recommended to those who are in search of inspiration for an epic
poem in two thousand cantos, or a tragedy in nineteen Acts. The
ihops are full of last year's bonnets: the streets contain only ancient
residents, suggestive of the days when the place was a refuge for the
poor or the proscribed; the hotels are absolutely empty.
To complete my cure, I left by the steamer for Folkestone, feeling
delighted at being able to exchange for the unutterable sadness
of a deserted French watering-place the wild adventures of a " dusty
passage" across the Channel, with a long railway journey to follow.
The voyage was all, nay even more, that I could have desired. I
spent the greater part of two hours and a half in being unexpectedly
thrown from one side of the Louise Dagmar to the other. I was
accompanied on these impromptu little expeditions by a bride and
bridegroom, an aged archdeacon, and a portly French gentleman who
was crossing the Channel for the first time.
In conclusion, I cannot help making the following suggestion.
The Emperor of RUSSIA is said at this moment tobe " eccentric," to
talk fiercely to himself, and to wander about his palaces in a savage
mood at night. If he could only be kidnapped, like the ex-Prince
of B0LOABIA, and taken to Boulogne, I feel sure that he would be
soothed into the most settled melancholy in half a dozen hours. At
least I know that I was.
I still remain, Tour obedient Servant,
A PERAMBULATING PLEASUEE-SEEIEB.
BEEKS AND "SKITTLES."
THAT a painter who possesses the power shown in such pictures as
"The Death of Jacob Van Maerlandt" and "A People'» Grati-
tude" (The Death of JAQUES VAN ABIEVELDE), should stoop to play
"such fantastio tricks" as JAN VAN BEKBS again revels in at the
Salon Parisien, seems more than a little pitiful. Popinjay Art is
plentiful enough. It is the trick whereby mediocrity antics itself
into a sort of notoriety, and cynical cleverness indolently plays the
fool with an easily-humbugged public. It is probably calculated—
perhaps with some reason—that these stagey tricks, and lime-light
effects, and dismal draperies, and bogey surprises, and_ peep-show
horrors will perplex people into a foolish wonder, if not into an im-
possible enjoyment or an honest approval. Maybe that is all which
is aimed at P But what an aim for anything calling itself Art!
Posturing Pierrots and smirking skeletons, gogglings phinxes and
giggling cocottes, cadaverous surprises and ensanguined startlers,
all the parade of nightmare and nastiness, pall upon the mind, as the
phantasmagoric effects and sickly scents do upon the senses, of the
visitors to the Salon Parisien. Whim and fantasy are all very de-
lightful in their way. But this is not Wonderland, it is the world of
drunken delirium and the Witches' Sabbath. A girl with emerald face,
purple hair, and vivid vermilion lips, peeping between amber por-
tières, is an inoffensive though purposeless, and not very interesting
bizarrerie. But such gratuitous ghastlinesses as " Willo' the Witp,
"Felo dr. te," "Vívela Morí!" and particularly the offensively named
"Ecce Homo" are simply revolting norrors. Somebody has hazarded
the statement that they are Edgar-Poe-ish. Pooh! POE was creepy
sometimes, but he was an artist, an idealist, subordinating even
occasional horror to the beautiful in his daring dreams. No,
Mr. J. V. В., Art, like life, is not all BEEBS and " Skittles."

WHAT of the Night? The shadows climb and lengthen,

Aurora slumbers still. What of the Night?

Guides the lost shipman o'er the watery waste:

What hidden mischiefs there await revealing,
To tax firm courage, test unshaken will?
None answers; and the silence doth enhance
The need of valour and of vigilance.
Darkness, and muttering thunders, and the shining
Of planets sinister the moment mark.
The starry oracles defy divining,
No eye may pierce the thick and threatening dark.
But the tired watcher may not shrink from facing
A dread alternative, a need abhorred,
Those high-raised ramparts resolutely pacing,
With eye unslumbermg and unsheathed sword.
Shadows may fly before the coming light,
But, till the dawn shall break, What of the Night?
A WELSHMAN'S WAK-SONG.
Нклк the song of GRIFFITH, hearken to the stave that GRIFFITH sang,
GRIFFITHS? No, not he—that Safe Man,—to the harp's melodious
twang.
At the Eistedfodd Rhyfoldyddelol, where a prize his verses gained,
Which he wrote against the Rector, for his tithes who had distrained.
Fiery was the face of GRIFFITH, like the fresh boiled lobster's mail;
"Ho !" he shouted, "to the Tithe-War, it is in Llangwmglch vale!"
GRIFFITH is a tenant-farmer, serious in his views and ways,
And he goes to Ebenezer, weekly; and his Pastor pays.
"March!" he cries, ye sons of MERLIN, " let us make an end of tithes,
Raised upon our stocks and produce, and our sickles and our scythes,
It is my abominations, Squire has made returns of rent,
Parson too must yield abatements, look you, twenty-five per cent.
"Though I don't deny the former when my balance-sheet is gain,
I detest to pay the latter, hard it goes against the grain.
Mr. MEREDITH I sit under, splendid preacher, deep divine.
But the Reverend M. B. MUGGEHIDGK is no Minister of mine;
"Tithes were in my rent allowed for. 'Tie no matter. Get away!
Altogether from religious scruples I object to pay.
Qualms of conscience is my reasons, why I lift my voice aloud.
England's Church be disestablished, England's Clergy disendowed!
"In the clouds with'us the spirits of our sires to battle rides.
There 's CADWALLADER, CADWALLO, UHIEN, many more besides.
OWEN GLENDOWER and MODRED, smites the titheowners with dread,
When they sing the magic song that makes Plinlimmon shake his head.
"Tithes is burdens, impositions, swindles, I'll no longer stand,
Cymry button up your trousers, till we 've kicked them off the land.
Burst your bonds, and fling your fetters to the winds and to the gales.
Flout the skies with Freedom's banner; fight for little gallant Wales I"
THS BEST "QTOTATTOW" FOB A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT Lauf.—
'It may be for years, or it may be for ever!"
BUETON, HAIL!
So Sir RICHARD BURTON—the real Arabian Knight ¡—after over
forty-four years of service—and such service !—contemplates retiring
into private life. When one reads his record, almost as marvellous
as one of the Thousand and One Tales, thinks of bis perilous
pilgrimages, his daring adventures, his travels in wild, turbulent,
and malarious regions, his labours as soldier, explorer, polyglot
linguist, and prolific writer, &c., &c., one wonders, not that at
sixty-five he should seek relief from an unhealthy and unthankful
post (as Consul at Trieste, where he has held on for over fourteen
years), but that he has any health and strength left to make his
well-earned retirement, as Mr. Punch trusts it will be, not only
welcome but enjoyable and of long duration.
Promotion has not assiduously dogged the heels of Sir RICHARD as it
does that of certain favoured servants of the Crown. If it had done
so, even in proportion to his deserts, he would probably now have
little to seek for or desire. As it is, the Public will assuredly say
that he has earned his retirement, and something more—something
considerably more. Rest should not be the only guerdon of long and
dangerous toil in one's country's cause! Think of the snug pension
a man may secure for condescending to sit for some months on a com-
fortable Woolsack! Mr. Punch, in the public interest, and with the
public's certain approval, pleads for large and liberal dealing with
the man who, among other notable feats too numerous to name here,
made the marvellous pilgrimage to Mecca, explored the Lake Region
of Central Africa, and was selected .to go in search of poor Professor
I'.v I,M I:H and his companions, murdered alas! by the Bedouins.
The usual official pension might satisfy the Circumlocution Office,
to which probably a Consul is just a Consul, whether he be a Burton
or—well, not a Burton. But it will not satisfy Sir RICHARD'S
admiring countrymen, who feel that he has claims upon all that the
Fount of Honour and the Civil List can do to secure his futur«
comfort and considération.
No "PUZZLE" FOR THE P.M. G.—How to obtain a private memo
randum confidentially prepared for a Governmental Department.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"Highly He»ommended."
SAUCE BEARNAISE!
FOE the same reason that induce« some persons to turn their money
by the light of the new moon, that is as a sort of spell to ensure
luck, Mr. En« A u ВВГСЕ has changed
the name of his theatre from the
Prince's to the Prince of Wales's.
He is "convinced/' he says, in a
published apologetic address, that
the change will be to the convenience
of the public." Why? What 's in a
name? Well, says EDGAB BBÜCE,
in the address, I discovered that
this name (Prince's) has caused a
very great deal of inconvenience to
the public from its similarity to
'Princess's.'" When you come to
think of it, it is a bit like it, and
how annoying for the visitor from
the country, who, having come up
expressly to enjoy Mr. EDGAB BBTJCB'S company, is taken off, willy-
nilly, to hear the declamation of Mr. WILSON BABRETT. Was there
any subtle agency at work which perverted the cabmen's minds, so
that when scmebody directed them to drive to the "Prince's,"
they at once insisted on taking them straight to the "Princess's " P
Be this as it may, we may sing to a recently-popular air,—
The excuie of EDOAH BRUCE for taking a new address is,
Folks declare, to drive straight there a cabby could not be had.
When you §aid, the " Prince'в," then they took you to the " Princeea'i,"
Which, though fun for WILSON В., was driving poor EDGAR mad.
And at the Prince of Wales's Mr. BEUCE has lately produced La
Béarnaise, a Comic Opera,—it rains Comic Operas just now,—music
by M. ANDRÉ MESSAGES, libretto by Mr. ALKRKD MÜBRAY from the
French of MM. LETEBKIEB and VANLOO. M. MABTTS is responsible
for the stage management; and in spite of the conductor ni the
orchestra bearing the ominous name of SLAUGHTEB, the music is
not murdered, but, on the contrary, considering that the piece fell
dead in Paris, Mr. SLAXTGHTEB seems to have put new life into it,
and to have extracted as much melody from
the work as it is capable of yielding. For,
honestly, it is not a Golconda of melody,
though the music, on the whole, is suffici-
ently pleasing and bright to carry the action
along to the end.
Two gems of the piece, the berceuse sung
by Miss FLORENCE ST. JOHN, and the trio
between Miss M л к i г. Т к.м г i ;ST, Miss FLORENCE
ST. JOHN, and Mr. SNAZELLE, are in the
Second Act; but the best thing of all, which,
for words, music, and comic acting, is worth
the whole Opera put together, is the military
duet and march in the last Act, between
Snazelle Perpignac and Jacquetle St. John,
disguised as a full private. Her drill, her
march forward to the footlights, her march
backward from the footlights (thisespecially),
are inimitable and irresistible.
The next best performance is Mr. HAR-
COURT'S as the feeble Duke. Neither a new
character to create, nor a difficult one to
sustain, but very easy to overdo. His __ ^
weakness ia his strong point, but Mons. Le .. -Гт,, , , , Л
Régisseur MABIUS, com™ metteur en scène, üulte a F1° of теЫУ"
ought never, after the First Act, to have let this Duke apçear on the
stage without a chair, even if the chair were a chaise a roulettes,
when its movements in the finale of the Second Act, with the Duke
in it, would have a novel and very comic effect. The Duke on his
legs and taking part in the action, having to advance and retreat
with the Chorus, after all his inanity and infirmity at the commence-
ment, is a mistake.
The plot of La Béarnaise is not too whimsical for the purpose of
Comic Opera, nor are the characters themselves unwarrantably
extravagant, but, with the exception of those represented by Miss
FLORENCE ST. JOHN, Miss TEMPEST, and Messrs. SNAZELLE and
HABCOTJRT, they are played as if they were the dramatis persona; of
a thorough Opéra Bouffe.
Mr. LONNEN'S Oirafo is something between the grotesque sprite
and the stereotyped comic policeman of the pantomime, while Mr.
DALIAS is the inevitable comic chamberlain, who, in the days of the
old-fashioned extravaganza, invariably used to exit dancing with the
King, and who, in the Opéra Bouffe era, now somewhat on the wane,
has been revived with most of his ancient prerogatives. For it is to
Opera Bouffe, and not to Comic Opera, that these two characters,
as now represented, really belong. But whose fault is this? Is it
due to the original authors (certainly not, if, a« I understand, it was


produced at the Bouffes), or to the English adapter, who styled it a
"Comic Opera," or to the actors and the stage manager, or to the
public? If the public will not be content without ite GIBABDS, its
pantomime and music-hall element in an entertainment which makes
an attempt at being Comic Opera, then, as " those who live to please,
must please to live," let all combine to give them what they demand:
only don't call a grotesque extravanga by the honoured name of '' Comic
Opera." The First Act is " no great shake»," except in respect to the
aspen-leaf Duke, but in the л.^ _f^. /7/**й»
second there are the trio, „ ¿~ ffV? ОКЯ
berceuse, and finale. After л
the duet in the Third Act,
which I have already praised,
зоте of us were congratu-
lating ourselves on the abs-
ence of the irritating" topi-
cal song," for which the only
proper place is the music-
hall, when the comic panto-
mime policeman entered, and
finding himself in possession
of the stage, he, I regret to
say, took advantage of the
opportunity to indulge in a
melancholy specimen of the
kind of ditty just alluded to,
—which most certainly does
not belong to M. MESSAGER's
Opera, nor does the very com-
monplace tune sound as if it D"ke 8Уа"еУ ,?»гсо«г' takei <;he chalr
were the work of the French Eminent Vocabt-all ihake» and quaren.
Composer. Miss M Aim: TEUFEST has a nice voice, and a merry
face, but the has nothing much to sing, though for what she has.
her vocalisation obtains an encore. The costumes are brilliant, and
the scenery in the First and Third Acts, highly effective.
Mr. SNAZELLE is always heard to advantage; but he will be teen
more to advantage when the others have made up their minds as
to whether the piece is a comic opera or a bouffe. Mr. SNAZELLB'S
mind being disturbed by conflicting doubts on this subject, he is at
one moment doing his part as well as his natural powers as a comedian
will permit him, and then finding that Messri. DALLAS
for example,
are indulging
in all sorts
of extravagant
drollery, it
occurs to him
to try a few
eccentric wag-
geries on his
own account, so
as not to be
quite out of
it. Receiving
no encourage-
ment from his
companions, he
assumes an air
of moody indif-
ference, from
which he is
only roused by
FLORENCE ST.
JOHN in the
military duet,
when he wakes
up again, and
pretends to play Mr. Snazelle and MiM St. John. It '• Natal »nd Military,
the drum and
fife both at once, and march about as though he were really enjoying
himself. But, O JFirenza la bella.' without thee, fair FLORENCE,
and thy sauce béarnaise, this piece de réiiitance would hardly
be worth retaining in the ill of fare.
What 's in a name as long as it succeeds? Did it fail at the
Bouffes Parisiens because it wasn't bouffe enough? and is that why
here they call it a comic opera and play it as a bouffe f Perhaps so.
Only don't let us flatter ourselves that we are recording the success
of a Comic Opera, that's all. Have something ready to produce
directly the business drops, Mr. BRUCE, but, for the present, don't
Be-arnaisy, says Yours, T. QUILL NLBBS.

ISAAE WALTON'S STATUE,—A handsome subsoriction will be
raked before the statue it erected. An inscription is wanted for
the pedestal. "Something about a rod" is generally proposed.
Л/г. Punch suggests—a single line.

"MAKING A (DOMESDAY) BOOK!»
Оя Monday the 25th of October Domesday Book is to be com-
memorated by "the Committee and those taking part in the
proceedings" (as the oommemorators are rather vaguely termed in
the Times] visiting the Public Records Office, where they will assist
at a lecture by " Mr. HUBERT HALL, F.R. Hist. 800." Until the fol-
lowing Friday they will haunt Lincoln's Inn Hall, listening from
time to time to an occasional harangue from gentlemen whose names
are not particularly familiar to the public, until the celebration is
brought to a triumphant conclusion by the reading of a paper on
"the Materials now available for re-editing the Domesday Book."
As ,)//•. Punch fancies that the subject of the Lectures are not
sufficiently local, he suggests a few more to assist in the compilation
of the new volume :—
"On the Origin of Kensington, and when it ceased to be Bromp-
ton, Bayswater, Hammersmith, and Kensal Green."
"On the Line dividing Putney from Wimbledon, with the Views
of the Local House Agents thereon,"
"On Belgravia and Pimlico, their limits andVancient rights,
tracing the rise of Grosvenor Place from Pimlico. and thejlevaop-
ment of St. George's Square into South Belgravia."
"On the Origin of Bedford Park, with some account of Turnham
Green before it was merged with West Kensington."
"On the Disappearance of Netting Hill, and the*loss of Bays-
water."
When Lectures on these subjects have been prepared, Mr. Punch
will be happy to suggest others of equal importance.
CONTEMPORARIES CORRECTED.—In the current number of the
Contemporary Review an article, signed "ELIZABETH ROBSON
PENNELL" [any relation to Mr. Punch's friend, author of Puck on
Pegasus / j says, à propos, incidentally, of the decadence of Pantomime,
which, it may have been noticed by the student of theatrical history,
has always been decading within the last ten decades, and is never a
bit the worse for it, that "At Drury Lane lost Christmas there
was no Columbine." The learned Authoress is in error, there toot a
Columbine in the Drury Lone Pantomime last Christmas. By the
way, it has been reported that, in consequence of the success of
the Run of Luck, AUGUSTUS DBDRIOLANUS will produce the Drury
Lane Pantomime at Her Majesty's. Nice as a compliment to Her
MAJESTY on the eve of her Jubilee Year,—but a mistake. Drury
Lane without a Pantomime at Christmas! Forbid it, ye gods—in the
gallery! But Mr. Punch has the authority of AUGUSTUS MAGNUS
himself to state that it is not improbable he may take A Run'of
Luck to the Empire, where it will be most welcome.

"MUMMY, I'VE GOT A WICKED THOUGHT!" "WHAT is IT, DARLING t"
"I U8ED TO THINK YOU WERE THE MOST LOVELY WOMAN IN THE WORLD—AND NOW I DON'T!'
KIND INQUIRIES.
THE order made, on the motion of Mr. THOBOLD Rooms, by the
House of Commons for certain returns relating to the Universities of
Oxford and Cambridge, does not appear to have been attended with
very satisfactory results. This, no doubt, _may be partly owing to
the disinclination manifested at the Universities themselves, to
furnish the information required, though at the same time it is quite
obvious that the chief source of the failure bas been the injudicious
character of the questions put to the various Professors, Readers, and
Lecturers, whose affairs formed the subject of the inquiry. Great
vagueness too, seems to have attended the examination of the present
position, and status of the " Married Fellows," to whose concerns the
investigation in question was purposed to pay a special regard. In
fact, to judge from the irritated and inconclusive nature of the re-
plies to the examination paper drawn up to elicit information under
this particular head, it can hardly be denied that that document
must nave been framed with a singular want of tact and judgment.
Probably, however, a still further inquiry will be made, when a few
direct and trenchant questions admitting only of simple and straight-
forward answers, will be put with far greater effect. A paper of
inquiry for instance on the following lines could not by any possibility
wound any prejudices, and as it would elicit the facts to be ascer-
tained in a familiar and comprehensive fashion, it is confidently
placed at the service of the Commissioners.
Have you ever filled the chair of the Bodmin Professor of Poly-
nesian Technology, and if so, state how many years it is since yon
have had a single attendant at any lecture.
If you have never given any lecture at all, mention some services
that you have rendered the University as a set-off for drawing your
salary, particularly stating whether they have taken the shape of a
periodical visit to the Botanical Gardens, the contribution of a por-
tion of a dictionary to a local publishing firm, or the sending of an
occasional double"acrostic to a Society journal.
Would you still continue to consider yourself entitled to the emolu-
ment attached to your Professorship if unable to discharge its duties
owing to having—
(1) To attend to a large practice as a Chancery Barrister.
(2} To act as permanent Captain on one of the General Steam
Navigation Company's Boulogne Steamboats.
(3) To work out a sentence of seven years' penal servitude?
Are you a " Married" Fellow? If so, state when and where the
ceremony took place, give a list of your wedding-presents, particu-
larly mentioning the number of paper-knives presented to you on
the occasion, and describe, as well as you can from memory, the
bridesmaids' dresses and the general appearance of the cake.
Have you any children? If so, say how many, furnishing their
respective ages, and referring to such proclivities as they possess
likely to influence the quiet, or the reverse, of College life.
If you have any boys, have they yet managed to get into the
College fountain or hide in the Chapel reading-desk? If so, has that
proceeding met with the sanction and approval of the Governing
Body?
Have you ever been summoned away suddenly in the middle of a
lecture to hold the baby? If so, state how often, and mention any
extenuating circumstances that you can allege in each particular
case in excuse of the proceeding.
Have yon been met, if at Oxford, in the High Street, or at Cam-
bridge at the College Backs, pushing about a double perambulator?
Is your mother-in-law a member of your family? and have you,
on the strength of that arrangement, had to provide her with rooms
"in College"?
If you pay an after-dinner visit to the common room, does she ask
you what " low place " you have been to, and threaten to come with
your wife, and wait for your coming out of Hall, if it happens
again?
Do yon consider the life of a "Married Fellow" one to be envied,
and, on the whole, a happy one, or do you recall with regret the days
when you were an engaged or even a single fellow?
Such are a few of the proposed leading questions, which, if
answered in the same spirit in which they are asked, could not fail
to give a practical turn to Mr. THOBOLD ROGERS'» inquiry that
would be attended with the best results.

CONSOLATION STAKES FOR À
RESTAURATION. — The Empire —
not the one on which the sun
never sets, but M. NI^OLS'S Em-
pire, on which the Licensing
Justices sat last week—has been
refused its licence as a Music
Hall, in rivalry to the Pavilion
and the Alhambra, by thirty-four
votes to twenty-five. M. NICOLS,
of the Regent Street Restaurant,
had better take this re-buff à la
mode pleasantly, as he ought to
be satisfied with his café com-
plet, and not hunger for an Im-
perial stake in Leicester Square.
If, however, he intends keeping
it on as a Theatre, let him open
with some plays which will be
quite in his line belonging to the
period of "The Drama of the
Restauration."
"QUEEN ОГ THE POOR."
"Touch me; that will relieve me." (Exclamation of a hopelessly and
loathsomely diseased inmate of the "Œuvre de Calvaire" to the Queen of
GREECE, atfectionately known as "Queen of the Poor," who WM vb-iting that
beneficent institution, among many others of the great Charities of Parie, to
the inspection of which ehe haï devoted several days.)
'MlDST the Gay City, Queen of Art and Pleasure,
A Queen more royal yet by far. employs
Days she might well devote to golden leisure
In looking—not on light Lutetia's joys,
Its pomps, its pageantry, its winning graces;
Sue turns aside from these to search and see
The broken lives, the scarred and shame-stamped faces,
That till its hidden haunts of Charity.
Hidden P Not from the eyes that mark more keenly
Than critic cold or pharisaio fool;
Nor from her sympathy whose soul right queenly
To sorrow, sin, and shame dares go to school.
"Touch me; that will relieve me I Cynic mocking
At courtly charity stands silent here.
Soft-nurtured souls might find the ordeal shocking,
Might shrink with loathing, or might pale with fear.
She shrank, she paled perchance, a Queen though kindly,
Yet took the stricken lazar's withered hand.
Men flatter slavishly, or curse half blindly,
The sceptred favourites of fortune bland;
Bat here 's a crown that hath no cruel glitter;
The stoutest democrat, the coarsest boor,
Need scarce assail with fervor bravely bitter
The royallest of names—" Queen of the Poor!"
Law AND LOGIC.—A noble Lord, writing to a newspaper, repeats
a statement which he made at the Church Congress, that in certain
States of America the law permitted a man to marry his Wife's
Daughter. This, he adds, " is the logical result, as pointed out some
years ago by the late Earl RUSSELL, of any relaxation in the degrees
of affinity prohibited by the law of England." Has it, then, resulted
from Colonial relaxation of the English marriage-law? If not, isn't
the logic of prejudice confuted by the logic of facts?
LAST Saturday a "par " in the Standard, speaking with par-ental
authority, informed us that "A College for the training of Actors
has just been founded at Berlin, in imitation of similar institutions
at Paris, St. Petersburg, and Vienna." Mr. Punch says: "Friends
of the Drama in England, please copy."

ciation with Pirates and Sorcerers, and giving up a Golden Reality

more popular compositions. It was ever thus. Mr. Punch trusts

ROBERT AT COOK'S LITTLE SWARRY.

How wunderfully suckemstanoes happens Bumtimes wen one's a
thinking of summut quite different! Going to a hengagement as I
had last week at the West End, who shood I meet of all pussons in
the wurld but my old frend the Cook of Portland Plaice. Fansy
meeting a Cook a taking a wark, and all in her best close too, in-
oludin a bran new Bonnet jest like a Briggan's At, and not of a
Sunday I I niver was more estonish'd. She cum up to me with
that particklar pleasing smile as lovely woman allers wears when
ehe 's got a new dress on, and meets a frend as ain't. I felt jest a
leetle orkard at fust, remembring the peeculier suckumstances under
which we larst parted, but she made no elusion to 'em, excep by
Baying, "If you '11 promise to behave yerself, we shall be glad to see
you to-morrow nieht at our little Swarry as we 're a going to have,
as all the fammerly 's out of town."
Of coarse I prommist to go, and go I did, and I don't no wen I 've
more injoyed myself. We had a puffeclv lovely tea, with shrimps
and sardeens and marmarlaid and sossidges, quite like the werry
hiest Nobillerty, and a little drop of sumthink nice in the larst cup.
And then we had a little danse. I dansed with Cook, and TOMSIUS
the tall horty Footman dansed with ARBYBELLER the Parler Maid,
and our music was one of the werry finest Street Horgans as I hever
herd, and clayed in such a marsterly style as would have delited the
Book of Edenburrow, or any other werry fust-rate Musician. Then
we had a little singing. TOMÏTOS sang, "My pretty Jane," which
he gallarntly, for the occashun, turned into *'My pretty AB.BY-
BEtLKR," at which she amost blnsht. Then I sang "Symon the
CeUarman," and not to be outdone in hommage to the Fare, I sub-
etitooted Dame Cooky for Same Margery, but not with werry great
Bucksess, as Cook said as she thort as old Symon was a conceited old
fool. However, I made up for it later on by reading to 'em my bran
new Romance, which I calls The Mystery of May Fare, "by one
behind the Seens," which they all declared to be the werry thril-
lingest, and most exsitingest, and the shortest story of modern times.
And as I quite agrees with 'em, I thinks as I shall werry shortly
publish it.
We then all set down to Supper, jest a duzzen of us. There would
ha' been 13! but Cook made young Buttons the Page set down in the
nex room by hisself, witch he only consented to do on condishun of
having a hextra pot of plum Jam all to hisself. I was glad to see
him sent out. It served him rite for larfing at me and Cook, when
we was a dancing. TOMMUS said in his horty way, that nothink
woud have injniced him to set down 13, as the ony time he ever saw
it done, a old gent werry nearly choked hisself with a fish bom
witoh of coarse was a warning to all of 'em. Being apealed to as 01
rayther xperiensed in this kind of thing, I told 'em my thrilling stoi
of the ex-Sheriff who went down all the way to Epping Forrest 1
dine, and being just a little late, the cumpany was all seated, ai
wen he saw as they was jest 12, and that he woud make 13, he fir
turned garstly pail, he then turned on his eel, and, without 01
singel word of apolergy or egscuse, he returned to the place froi
wenee he came, and aeshally went without his dinner! All on 'ei
thort as this was one of them hacts of self-sacrifice as was wurthy 1
compare with any as they 'd ever heard on. The Butler, who:
rayther a littery man, said as it reminded him of Sur Рнтт.и
SIDNEY'S gallant acshun at the Battle of Waterloo.
We coud n't have no more dansing as the Horganist had left "an
taken the Horkestry with him, so the Butler he brewd us a perfeol
lovely Bowl of Punch, and we set round the tabel and told anneck
dotes. Sum was of rayther a startlin carackter, such as TOMMTS'
tale of the last Darby, how he got the strait tip from the Dook с
WESTMINSTER'S Footman, and betted with a most respectabel lookin¡
gent on the course, and won sewen pound ten, which the gent paii
him quite honerabel with a ten-pound note, TOMMUS giving him th
difference, and how shortly arterwards he saw the same respectabe
gent a being chivied by a mob without no hat, and his coat tern u;
the back, and all as he was told, because he was a Welshman, am
how when he went nex day to git his note changed he found as it wa
a forgery! He kindly forbore to repeat the langwidge as he used pi
that ocasión, out of respec, as he said, to the Ladies, but we mit
bleeve as how it was rayther powerful I
I told 'em too or three stagger.ers about parst Lord Mares, witol
was werry successful, but the wun as pleased the Fare Sects most
was the account of how we takes it by turns at the Manshun Ouse
after ewery Bankwet to which Ladies of Fashun is inwited, to havi
the fust go round the rooms with a dust-pan and a broom, to sweet
up all the I limons and other jewels as the Ladies has dropt, witt
sitch results sumtimes as wond estonish 'em all did I dare menshur
it, but we was all most sollemly swore to secresy! They tried werrj
hard to make me brake my wow, but all in wane. So" as it was a
gitting late the sollem Butler kindly wound up the heavening by
perposing my elth as the Gest of the Party, witch he did in sitcr
flattering turms as amost maid me blush. He said among other
things, as I hadded dignerty to my nobel perfession. I trust I re-
plied fittingly, as became my karacter and persition. The Bntlei
told me afterwards that he had seldom heerd sitch a speech, outside
the Theatre, which sent me away smiling and appy, for my xperience
tells me as we all likes a little bit of flattery, from the werry hiest to
the werry lowest, witch must include a good lot on us. ROBERT.
DIVORCE MADE EASY.
DEAR MB. PUNCH,
A WHITES in the St. Jaméis Gazette, dealing with the
subject of the Divorce Laws, calmly proposes that in any revision
of the code, which he strongly advocates, women should be placed
on the same footing with men." Such a pestilent heresy of course
provoked correspondence, and, as I have made a careful study of
the subject, I beg to submit to you, Sir, a few reasonable grounds
for divorce, which this reformer will, I hope, include in his precious
revised code.
A man should be allowed to obtain a divorce from hie wife on all
or any of the following grounds :—
1. If he sees anyone he likes better than his wife.
2. If his mother-in-law comes too often.
3. If his wife's brother borrows money of him.
4. If she objecte to his going to Paris without her.
5. If, knowing that he prefers the tops of the muffins at breakfast,
she eats any of them.
6. If she hears him come in at four in the morning, when he has
considerately taken off his boots to do so quietly.
7. If she refers to it.
8. If she ever says, "My dear, I think we've heard that story
Defore."
9. If she doee not laugh consumedly whenever he tells a comic story.
10. If she objects to smoking.
11. If she is not civil to all his male friends.
12. And female ones.
There, Sir, you have a dozen suggestions which I would commend
ю the attention of this law-reformer. You will observe I have not
Deluded any trivial reasons for divorce, and the procedure, as the
St. James'в Gazette says, "should be as expeditions and inexpensive
as possible." Yours faithfully,
Turtle-Save Terrace. A TENDEE HUSBAND.

FANATICS FLOOKED.
ME. PUNCH congratulates Dean BRADLEY
on his admirable answer to the three fanati-
cal Protestant-defence Secretaries, who
would have forcibly ejected from Westmin-
ster Abbey some Roman Catholics who were
saying their private prayers around the
"strong quadrilateral barrier of bronze,"
which, as stated by Canon DUCK-WORTH,
protects the tomb of EDWARD THE CON-
FESSOE from profane hands.
Mr. Punch heartily wishes that the con-
duct of English Protestants visiting the
Catholic Churches abroad were anything
like as inoffensive, and as appropriate to the
sacred precincts, as was that of the poor be-
nighted Romanists in Westminster Abbey,
who, thinking that the best use to which a
church could be put, was to say prayers in
it, knelt and prayed accordingly. If a
number -of Mahommedans with their tur-
bans on and their sandals off, were to kneel
down and pray in Cologne Cathedral, or if
Mr. McCLUBE, the Protestant-defence Secre-
taries, and all their contributors, were to
visit St. Peter's at Home on Guy Fawkes'
Day, aftfr there say ;their private prayers,
would the beadles interfere with them, or
would the Secretary of the Propaganda
complain of the scandal, and beg that steps
should be taken to prevent its repetition?
After all, the attitude of prayer in a place
of worship, be it what it may, is more
fitting than talking and laughing loudly,
walking about, and using opera-glasses—
and all this even during the most solemn
public functions—to the great annoyance of
the congregation proper, and to the intense
scandal of those travelling English who, no
matter what their creed, do know how to
behave themselves, and who blush for the
insolent caddishness of their ill-bred com-
patriots. No; if Dean Punch saw a hundred
ARRYS, Romans, or Rum'uns, of any sort,
praying in Westminster Abbey, would he

interfere? No, bless 'em, certainly not. But if he saw one of them sneaking out a pencil to
scribble his name on a monument, or attempting to nick a bit out of a shrine, or off a tomb, he 'd
be down upon him then and there, and have him up before the nearest police-magistrate,
charged with "maliciously damaging," and lined heavily for the offence, no matter what his
excellent motive might have been for such wanton destruction. And this is what the Dean
and Chapter would do, too; for whether it be a fanatic on one side or the other, law and order
must not be set aside, in favour of such a rule as " Omne ignotum pro Fanático."
CAVENDISH COLLEGE.—The very name suggests if not a royal road to learning, at least
some " short cut." A Correspondent signing himself " RUBBER," supposes that in the cloisters,
instead of the word " Silence" being written up, they '11 have " Whist!" inscribed, and that
the only " big big D," allowed on the premises will be a " Dummy." In the Common Room
there should be a portrait of CAVENDISH in HOTLE.
AN ALTERNATIVE.—The Social Democratic Federation, in their curious exchange of polite
letter-writing with Colonel Sir JAMES FBASBB, object to being " saddled" with the responsi-
bility for ,the mischief which may follow their proposed Lord Mayor Show's Day Demonstra-
tion. To avoid this, it would perhaps, on the whole, be better for them to be "bridled1
beforehand. Eh, Colonel?

HONEYED WORDS.
MR. VATTQHAN has been, to say the least of it, putting
things rather mildly at Bow Street. A certain Mr.
ROBERT HOWARD was the other day brought up, and, on
the unsupported testimony of a single Constable, looked
up, on remand, in Holloway Gaol from the Saturday till
the following Monday morning, when several witnesses
being forthcoming, all able to swear to the fact that the
Constable in question had been committing perjury, the
worthy Magistrate discharged the prisoner, whom he
admitted had been wrongfully detained in custody. He
at the same time took the opportunity of administering
the not very crushing rebuke to the Constable by inform-
ing him that " if he did not take care he would be getting
himself into trouble." It is not easy to fathom the
depths of Mr. VATTGHAN'S long-suffering, and to say pre-
cisely what constitutes " getting into trouble" from his
point of view, but we should have thought, reading the
case off-hand, that the Constable referred to had managed
something very like it. Taking him at his own standard,
we shall expect to find Mr. VATOHAN dismissing the wife-
jumper with a good-humoured caution to the effect that
he "really should be more careful, and take care where
he is treading." A little honey is"well ^enough on the
Bench, but when every day discloses the gross abuse of
justice that arises in cases similar to the one in question,
it certainly would have seemed wiser to withhold its
administration in this particular instance.
Атот "THE MAN FOE GAXWAY."—Lord CLANBICARDE.
"'MULTON' IN PARVO" IN WYCH STREET.
i. MY DEAR MB. Риясн,
You may remember that when Mr. NIBBS, your esteemed Representative
at the Theatres, was exhausted, after a long series of opéra bouffe, yon sent for
me and ordered me to attend the Olympic to see The Governess, I raised some
objection. I explained to you that I had heard that it was an exceedingly
pathetic play, being, indeed, a translation from a French version of East Lynne,
and that as I was easily—very easily—moved to tears, I would willingly excuse
myself from the duty. You then, Sir, informed me that Mr. NIBBS was
unnerved in consequence of having received from "the sole lessee," Miss
HAWTHORNE, a scarlet letter of invitation, which had nearly frightened him into
fits. Upon this I tried to pass the matter off lightly as a joke, amusingly
observing that there was nothing strange in finding the name of HAWTHORNE to
a Scarlet Letter, when you observed that the same idea had occurred to you,
but that you had rejected it on the score that "it was too evident, and sure to
be thought of and used by somebody else." So I had to submit, and therefore
am in the position to tell yon all about it.
I must admit that " the note in red" (as no doubt Mr. WHISTLER would have
called the gore-coloured epistle) had its effect upon myself. I felt distinctly
"jumpy ;" and so, to brace my nerves and secure a hearty laugh, I looked in at
the Salon Parisien, where I heard Mr. JAN VAN BEERS was absolutely rollicking
in pictorial waggery. After glancing at two or three comic studies in green
flesh-colour and purple hair (possibly the product of the artist having used.up all
the other pigments on his palette) I came to the now celebrated " sell." I was
duly warned by an illuminated notice (resembling "This way to the Boato"
you see at nignt at Southampton and Dover) that I had better not venture
unless my nerves were unusually strong, was passed on by a Commissionnaire,
who told me " to turn to the right, and walk close to the picture," and found
myself before " the skeleton." Ifancy that it must have been altered since it was
first so graphically described in the pages of the press. There were no peep-
holes, but only a roughly-painted anatomical figure, strongly reminding me,
in its Christy Minstrel attitude, of "the original bones." 1 walked forward,
there was a tin-kettle crash like the sound of the gong of a French locomotive,
and I saw my laughing face, with its nineteenth-century high hat, reflected on
a looking-glass that the nigger-bones was carrying instead of a banjo. I never
remember witnessing anything more supremely ridiculous, and can only say that
should anyone be attracted to the Salon Parisien in the hope of seeing something
ghastly in the shape of "JEcce Homo," he will assuredly be disappointed. It is
what the French call " a 'ombogs" and " a nonsense."
Having thus got myself into a proper frame of mind for the English translation
of "Miss Multan," I presented myself at the Olympic and was admitted. As
I entered, that fine old farce the Little JRebtl was drawing to a close, but I had
an opportunity of seeing Mr. HUBERT BYRON, an actor whose name is unfamiliar
to me. This young gentleman, when he has had a little more experience, (I
judge from his reading of the part of Arthur Turni)>top—I am not quite sure of
the surname, but I think it was Turniptop) should make a very excellent
"Second Murderer," in Macbeth,
After the lever de rideau, we had the pièce Je resistance in a prologue and
four Acts. Frankly, the play, which a* I have already stated, is merely a version
of East Lynnc, is too long. The prologue in which nothing happens, save the
giving of a Christmas party by the sister of a doctor, who has nothing whatever
to do with the plot, to the poor children of the neighbourhood, might come out
en bloc. The subtle suggestion that the sister is at heart a miserly "screw"
by making the Christmas-tree the feature of an otherwise rather dismal enter-
tainment, a three and sixpenny one, (toys extra, two shillings) is not worth
the expenditure of time the elucidation entails. The four Acts might be'halved,
and the piece played in two Scenes, so far (is the story is concerned. But other
alterations would be advisable. There are but three men in the cast, and
all of them are profoundly unsympathetic, and two of them absolutely unneces-
sary. The crazy Doctor, who appears in the prologue and last Act, might be
carted off with his sister, and a doddering old tutor, whose costumes puzzled
the audience by their eccentricity (in one Act he wore the attire of a Beau
NASH, and in the next the garb of a Methodist parson) might also disappear, as
all he has to say and do, might be said and done by a ladies'-maid.
Without these two superfluities, the male element of the play would be reduced
to one, the husband, and I am not at all sure, as the part is profoundly unsympa-
thetic, it could not be omitted and the lines given to someone else_. The male
characters having thus been all cut out,' I really thinkja reduction might be made
in the females. The Doctor has a maid who of course would disappear with
his ménage. The husband has a second wife, who in his absence would be de trop.
With the disappearance of this lady, naturally her maid would vanish. The cast
would be now reduced to Miss Multan and her two children. Well, as
the last two are played, infants on the stage are invariably a nuisance,
and can always be eliminated with advantage. Her children cone, there is no
raison d'etre for the mother, and she might follow them. The title of the piece,
"The Governess" would now alone be left—it is not a good one, and its loss
would be a positive gain. These suggestions, if heartily carried out, no doubt
would alter the character of the piece at the Olympic very considerably. Still,
in the interests of all concerned, I cannot help heartily recommending their
adoption, the more especially as Miss HAWTHORNE is a graceful actress, and
worthy of better things. CHABLES—YOUB FBIEND.

And you, the flock's fatling, the popular pet,
The true model boy, the Academy's darling,
Left mooning and munching in solitude yet,
No sound but the shindy of Irishmen snarling
And Socialists snapping your bosom to cheer?
It 's really distressing, it moves one to pity.
With no one to lend you a " hand" or an ear,
What use to be wise and what good to be witty?
You can't go on cutting good jokes cn yourself,
Your soul on your own careful epigrams nourishing.
Why should you pine, left alone on the shelft
Whilst inferior rivals are flitting and flourishing?
There 's "SPENCER," who 's keeping all Europe agog,
While nobody mentions your name—an ill omen!
Then JOSEPH and JESSE have fled from the fog;
The newspapers teem, Sir, with CHAMBERLAIN'S women.
That cannot be right, or, at least, if it is,
You ought to be heard of from Finland to Florence.
You '11 soou be ignored, save by quidnunc or quiz.
A fate which, of course, you must view with abhorrence.
Why, why should you keep up a modest incog.,
Or why in the Time» and a teacup your nose bury,
Whilst Specials the footsteps of CHAMBERLAIN dog,
And the East 's all agog for the advent of ROSEBERY?
HARTINQTON even they say 's on the wing.
It's clearly the fashion for Statesmen to travel;
Can you not devise some adventurous thing
That all competition will distance and gravel?
Come, what do you say to a turn in Cathay,
Or a sweet little trip up the wild Irrawaddy?
Of course we shall miss you, but, once in a way,
A year without yon will not kUl anybody.
Of home-keeping youths and their wits you're awarb
What our bHAKSPEAHE has said ; you could hardly be homely
But even an engine-turned wit needs repair.
Come, come, do not loaf, 'tis not seemly or comely.
Do get away somewhere, your mind to improve.
Old age may excuse the great Hermit of Hawarden,
But you're a mere boy, and should be on the move,
Not loiter and munch like a snail in a garden.
Your fellows all over the world are a-wing,
And nobody wishes to hinder or flout them;
Their absence at least does one excellent thing—
It shows that the Country can jog on without them.
"Our Poor Little Army."
THERE is much talk just now about a more or less apocryphal
"Army Corps." What the Public begin to doubt is, whether this
Corps should not be spelt with an e, seeing that it is represented to
be the sort of inert, immobile thing, that—to adapt the obsolete old
boast—can go nowhere, and do nothing. An Army which is but a
corpse would be a fitting complement of battalions which are but
"skeletons."
"What of the Night P"
NUMEROUS star-gazing Correspondents have respectfully pointed
out to Mr. Punch that, in his last week's Cartoon,
Ursa Major, as all must see,
Has got his head where his tail should be.
"Quite so," courteously replies Mr, Punch. "This position indi
cates Russia's Reverse in Bulgaria."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAEI.
MEMBERS WE HAVE MISSED.
STILL have a few more sketches of Members in the last Parliamenl
who did not find a seat in the present one. Here is Mr. STRONG (!'
who sat for North Camherwell in the brief Parliament of last year,
when he beat WILFRID BLUNT by t
small majority. Though a Vestryman
and a Poor-Law Guardian, he was a
man of pleasant humour. "Yon may
be Blunt," he said to WILFRID when
they met at the nomination,
r" "but I am Strong." BLUNT
J did not forget this sparkling
jeu d'esprit, and when the
subject of this memoir dis-
Speared at the last Genera!
ж ection, he wrote to say, "Yes,
'but you were not Strong enougl
to keep the seat." It is a pity he
is gone, for a better listener the
dinner - hour did not produce.
Conservative Members, not sure
of an audience, always tried to
plant themselves immediately
opposite Mr. STRONG. His claspec
fj hands, his flowing beard, his engrossée
7 attitude of attention, and his benevo-
lent brow were always equal to
quorum.
Mr. GILBERT BEITH (2) was one of those
flowers out off by early doom which strewed
,,•. the pathway of the last General Election.
v; Elected for Central Glasgow late in 1885, he
was defeated as early as possible in 1886. Though quite a youngster
in the House of Commons, he was an Elder in the Free Kirk oí
Scotland. He took the pleasures of House of Commons life sadly;
and as he sat on the otherwise empty bench, and listened to Sir
GEORGE CAMPBELL or Sir GEORGE BALFOTTH, there was in his coun-
tenance a sort of prescience of coming doom.
Mr. THOROLD ROGERS (3) is missed perhaps more especially
in the Smoking - Room ana on the Terrace, where, on summer
evenings, he was wont to give a classic tone to conversation. In
the House, Mr. ROGERS could take snuff against Mr. WABTON,
and, if need be, shout him down. Yet note the ingratitude of the
Liberal leaders. Mr. WARTON, fallen into disrepute with the electo-
rate, is handsomely provided for in
distant Aus-
tralia. Mr.
Т H o в o LD
ROGERS is left
to look out for
himself, a task
not congenial
to a man of re-
tiring habita.



(2) (3)
Sir ROBERT PEEL (4) is another interesting Member for whom it
might reasonably be expected an appreciative Partv, having the
opportunity, would do something handsome. If Mr. WABTON was to
be made Attorney-General for Western Australia, why should
not Sir ROBERT PEEL be made Governor of the Bahamas,
or some other dependency with a sonorous name? The record of
POPE HENNESSET would be made of no account in comparison with
what the Right Hon. Baronet would within twelve months do in
such a position. But, as everyone knows, Sir ROBEBT PEEL at a
critical moment capriciously put himself put of court. Weary of the
growing monotony of Conservative allegiance, he went wrong on the
Home-Rule question at the General Election, and has probably
closed a chequered political
career.
Below (5) is Mr. GOSCHEN,
a warning to politicians
for all time. A man of
conspicuous abilitVj with
curious strata of Liberal-
ism running through a
geological foundation of
Toryism, he has remained
a puzzle to himself and а
tribulation to.his friends.
Endeavouring with un-
doubtedly honest purpose
to walk on both sides of
the political road, he
stands forlornly left in the
middle.
And last of all (6) is Sir
GEORGE THEVELYAN whose
temporary retirement is
the most effective single
blow! the new House\has
received. Sir GEORGE
maintained in conspicuous
degree all the highest
traditions of the House of
Commons. "Though an
Irish Secretary," as he
once said, standing at bay
before a pack of Parnellites,
he is an English gentleman.
From that altitude he
never descended. Courtly, cultured

BUT WE 'VE PUT HIM IN THE 'EiRSB NOW—AND WE HAV'NT 'EARD
ANY COMPLAINTS so FAR!"
IN THE LANGUAGE OF DIPLOMACY.
IN consequence of the recent agitation on the subject of the
linguistic deficiencies of officials occupying prominent and important
positions in Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service, the following paper
and questions, has, it is rumoured, been issued by the Authorities in
the Foreign Office, for distribution at all the leading Embassies and
Legations in Europe :—
1. How many European languages can you speak? If none,
describe the process of your learning French at Eton, and say whether
you are sufficiently master of it to translate an ordinary dinner-table
menu, travel from London to Paris, lunching at Amiens on the way,
and furnishing the cocher on your arrival, correctly with the name of
your hotel,
2. Given the situation, that you are suddenly dispatched on a
mission to Central Europe, where you have to meet a Roumanian
delegate who can only speak indifferent German, which you do not
understand, and to whom you have to explain the provisions of a
new commercial treaty, dealing with the importation of potatoes on
a reduced scale of duty, in such scraps of French as you can com-
mand,—explain by what process of resort to hieroglyphics, or the
language of the deaf and dumb, you can discuss with him the
matter in question, and arrive ultimately at its satisfactory solution.
3. If appointed to an Italian legation, do you think you could turn
your acquaintance with the libretti of the various Operas you
may have heard from time to time at Covent Garden, to account?
Do you see your way to working in any of the conversation between,
for instance, Don Gtiovanni and the Commendatore, into a delicate
but concise discussion of the present Italian position at Massowah?
4. The following passage occurs in a letter, in French, addressed
recently by a high British Official in '.Eastern Europe to the repre-
sentative of the CZAK, whom he was deputed to meet. Correct, and
indicate where it errs from a too familiar and unconventional dis-
regard of the foreign idiom :—
"Pourquoi il faut que je pointé out a votre Excellence que le
Government de sa Majesté n'est pas a être hoodwinké si facilement
dans la manière que vous suppose. Il me semble que M. le General
KAULBABS a joué la bas une game tout a fait de son own, et dans son
attempt to stifler l'expression du public opinion de la pays, et de
hindrer au tant que possible le meeting de le Sobranje, il a got hold
of tout entirement, le wrong bag of tricks. Pour cette raison quoi
que le Government de sa Majesté n'a pas la moins d'idée d'interférer
dans cette galère la il a considéré the-right-sort-of-thing-to-do,
vous savez, de faire savoir votre Excellence dans la manière le plus
absolue que son visage est set resolutement against telles dodges et
machinations, qu'il regard comme beneath le dignité et principle
d'un civilised Government European."
5. If appointed to a diplomatie post in Russia, mention, if you can,
any peculiar qualifications you possess calculated to fit you specially
for it. Have you ever resided in St. Petersburg Place, Bayswater?
Petro-Paulo-vicks," and say whether you like caviare? Show how
your ability to answer the above would indicate your capacity to
deal with a settlement of complications arising out of some unex-
pected hitch in the progress of pending negotiations in connection
with the Central Asian Question.
"PLEASE TO FORGET THE NINTH OF NOVEMBER."
ME. H. W. LEE, Secretary to the Social Democratic Federation,
having declined on behalf of the Association of which he is an officer,
Sir JAMES ERASER'S polite invitation to remain absent from the
Lord Mayor's Show, the following additional "features" will no
doubt figure in the Procession :—
Guards (Black) to clear the way.
Members of the Long Firm, in their Carriages.
Banner of JONATHAN WILD. Banner of CLAUDE DU VAL.
"Confidence Tricksters," two and two.
Mr. JEREMIAH DIDDLER, in his State Chariot.

Swell The Dishonourable, the "De'il may care," Swell
Mob. accompanied by the Governor of the Gaol and Mob.
his Chaplain. Escort of Mounted Police.
Guards (Black) to keep the way clear.
The route of this part of the Procession is expected to visit the
Police Courts in Marlborough Street, Worship Street, and Bow Street,
en rouie for the Old Bailey.
Bule and Scale.
MEASURE for measure! We 're nearing Yule,
The League may win, or the League may fail;
But they who fain would avoid Home Rule
Might try Lord TOLLEMACIIE'S Sliding Scale!
"BLESS You! You KNOW WHAT I MEAN."—THE Standard, in
a leader on sport, containing so much sound advice that young athletes
would do well to follow this leader, said :—
"Advertisements of foot-race meetings frequently announce that so-and-eo
'will start from scratch, and endeavour to beat record ; ' or a cyclist starts on
a long ride with the same object in view, and 'pace-makers' are provided to
lead him in turn, so that he shall not listen to the demands of Nature and
slacken hi« speed."
"Расе-maker," sounds like the Irish for " Peace-maker," but to
speak of him as "that blessed Расе-maker," would rightly imply
the reverse of a benison.
JUBILEE SUGGESTIONS.—"If a Church House be indispensable,"
observed Mr. Punch, "purchase the Crystal Palace. Splendid site."
"Excellent," replied Lord RANDOLPH; "because this would show
that the Clergy gave in their adhesion to a Church Hill."

OUT OF SITE.
THE question asked at the close of last Session in the House by
Mr. W. G. C. BENTINCK, as to the possibility of finding a better site
for the effigy of JAMES THE SECOND, at present standing behind
Whitehall Chapel, having created a considerable stir among the
other London Statues, a midnight meeting, which was numerously
attended, was held last night in the immediate neighbourhood of
Palace Yard, for the purpose of bringing the matter under discussion.
RICHARD CŒ.UB-DE-LION having been unanimously voted into the
Chair, said he thought, in opening the proceedings, he need not
dwell on what had brought them together. They were all well aware
of the facts. Some improvements in the neighbourhood of White-
hall had raised the question of moving his respected descendant,
JAKES THE SECOND. (Laughter.) It appeared that GRDTLING GIB-
BONS, who, he believed, was responsible for him—(" Hear.'")—had
invested him with considerable artistic merit, and that it was pro-
posed, in consequence, to place him on a more conspicuous site. The
question was, where could that site be found? There was room by
him further along Abingdon Street, but perhaps GRINLING GIBBONS'»
masterpiece thought it too retired, and would prefer some crowded
spot on an omnibus route. However, he merely threw that out as a
suggestion, and he would leave the meeting to discuss it.
CHARLES THE FIRST, of Charing Cross, said he could not endorse
the Chairman's suggestion at all. He spoke well within knowledge
of his subject when he said that no worse site could be found for a
statue than in the midst of a crowded thoroughfare. Look at his
case. More than half the omnibuses in London passed and repassed
him all the day long; but though he possessed great artistic merits,
not a soul ever stopped to examine him. (Loud laughter.) They
might laugh, but it was a fact. His beau ideal of a site was a London
Square.
CHAELES THE SECOND, rose to remonstrate. He said he was sorry
to have to contradict his Royal father, but he begged to assure him
that, if he had had his experience, he would never entertain such an
unconscionable notion for a moment. He had for years been stuck
in the very Central Square of Soho, and a more miserable site he
could not conceive. It was not only as dull as ditch water—(Laughter)
—but he didn't believe even the occupants of the adjacent houses knew
who on earth he was. (Laughter.) Indeed he confidently believed if
you were to ask any of Messrs. CROSSE AND BLACKWELL'S carmen
his name, they would probably tell you he was Duke of Oxford
Street.
The Duke of BEDFORD, of Russell Square, said he fully endorsed
the verdict of the last speaker. Here was he, famous in his day, yet
he would be bound that the local Milkman did not know him from
Fox in Bloomsbury Square hard by. (" Shame. ! ") He only wished
he could get somebody to move him. He would soon be on the
Embankment.
Here SIR J. OUTRAJI and Mr. BRUNEL both rose to protest, the
latter hotly insisting that for all intents and purposes of being
properly displayed, he might as well be stuck up on Blackheath
Dr. JENNER (interruptingin a melancholy voice).—orin Kensington
Gardens. (Roars of Laughter.)
JAMES THE SECOND then rose. He said that while sympathising with
the last speaker, who certainly was located in a very out-of-the-way
situation—(Laughter)—he had at least one advantage over him. He
had not been dragged up before Parliament to be abused by a beggarly
Member. ( Chcert.) He spoke with some warmth, but he had been
referred to as "having been removed from his throne for misconduct."
(" Shame!" "So youtcere!" Uproar.) He was not to be put
down by clamour, and he would like to ask honourable Members
where they got their history from?
WILLIAM THE THIRD—From MACAULAY. (Laughter.) How-
ever, he had nothing to say on the subject. He was snug enough in
St. James's Square, where he thought, by the way, the public gene-
rally took him for his illustrious predecessor. (Laughter.) But he
didn't care.
The Duke of YORK said he thought it did not matter where a
London Statue was placed. They had all somehow got a bad name.
(" Oh! oh ! ") Personally, he was very glad to be perched up on his
birdcage, well out of sight, where nobody could examine his points.
He thought Mr. PLUNKET had better let JAMES THE SECOND alone.
The discussion was then warmly continued, several Statues from
the remoter London Squares taking part in it, and some two or three
sites were in turn suggested, a preference being shown for one in
Shaftesbury Avenue. Daylight, however, breaking, the Chairman
suddenly withdrew, and the meeting separated ultimately without
arriving at any definite decision of the matter under discussion.
THIS advertisement in the Daily' News of October 22 is worth
recording :—
/4ROYDON HIGH SCHOOL.—The SECOND MEETING of OLD
\J GIRLS will be held at the above on the 9th November, nt 4 o'clock, to
further Organise the Association of Old Croydonians. All Old Girle invited.
It ought to have been headed, " Great Attractions!" What a crowd
of outsiders there will be! The 5th, perhaps, woiild have been better
than the 9th. And it might have appropriately finished up with, "No
Followers."
ATHENIAN ANTIQUITIES.—Among the various "movements" to
which people are invited to contribute money, one now on foot under
exalted auspices, is a motion for the establishment at Athens of a
British School of Archœology. Very good; but doesn't transferring
Archœology to Athens very much resemble carrying coals to New-
castle':

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Lecture to the Brethren.
MR. PUNCH'S NEW ORDER.
THE interesting account in a recent Times number, of the visits of
the good Queen of GitEECEJto the various charitable institutions in
Paris, and notably to the House of the
Little Sisters of the Poor, recalls to
-, Mr. Punch's recollection, how many
f¿-) years ago the author of a certain work
I* entitled Happy Thought Hall, offered a
V suggestion lor the establishment of a
Social Confraternity to be entitled The
Little Brothers of the Rich. Their
head-quarters were to be in a central
position in London, and the Superior
was to send out every month a list of
the Little Brothers whose kindly services
were at the disposition of all those who
could afford them, whether in or out of
the Season.
The development of the telephone has rendered this idea still more
practicable, as within half an hour a Little Brother could be
summoned in any case of urgent necessity from the Central House to
an outlying district, or from one of the suburban establishments to a
fashionabte quarter.
"The Emergency Brothers " who would always be ready at their
posts, could be available for any such cases of real distress as, for
example,—a hostess suddenly finding there were thirteen at dinner.
She could at once wire to the Central House for the sort of Little
Brother she required, "to make the fourteenth at a scientific or
musical, or theatrical, or serious, or aristocratic, or ecclesiastical, or
mixed dinner-party." Or again, supposing a hostess had asked
everyone to dinner and supper afterwards, to meet Mr. _CoRNEY
GRAIN, and that at the last moment a note of apology arrives, but
Mr. GRAIN doesn't—("unavoidably detained"—" circumstances o ver
which "—" loss of voice," &o., &c.)—the hostess need not despair,
but being a subscriber to the Order she wires off, or sends her
brougham (brougham preferred) to the Central House, and back it
comes with as good a substitute for the great original (made up not
unlike him too, if time permits) as can possibly be obtained.
Indigent sons of poor but noble families will belong to it. A
hostess requiring an aristocratic Little Brother, foreign or English,
from a Duke to a Baronet, has only to send and say the sort of Little
Brother she requires, and he will be at her house with his star and
garter, or blue sash, or bit of riband, or whatever it may be, and
capable of making as good a display of himself as the highest in the
land.
There would be Little Brothers for
show only, without any conversation:
then there would be Little Brothers
with a perfect flow of conversation.
Little Brothers who are model racon-
teurs and full of anecdote; others
who can back their opinions in sporting ;'
matters, and who have the history of *j
the turf at their fingers' ends. All
the expenses of Little Betting Brothers,
Little Card-playing Brothers, Little
Billiard Brothers, and of Sporting
Brothers generally, will be borne by
the host or hostess hiring them, who
shall have previously stated the limit
to which they are prepared to go,
and who shall undertake to give
fifteen per cent, of all winnings to the successful Little Brother,
who wiU have to hand over five per cent, to the Superior for the
good of the Order.
Wedding parties supplied with Little Brothers (of agreeable
appearance and distinguished manners) as Best Men. Near Connec-
tions, Distant Relations, also as the comic after-breakfast Speaker,
or sentimental Friend of the Family, to propose Bride's health.
It will be seen from this slight sketch of an idea (originated years
ago in the work we have already mentioned) which Mr. Punch is
prepared to dcvelope, and in due course to lay its further details
before the public, that this new Order, without any sort of excep-
tion or compromise which would be fatal to its existence, is essentially
The Little Brothers of the Rich.
THE OLD MISTAKE.—The Amateur Actors of London, it seems, have
now a " press organ" of their very own. It is called Ourselves. Why
not go the entire animal, and call it Our Noble Selves? These
Amateur Actors have only one fault. They are too modest.
NEW SENSATIONAL ROMANCE.—" The Curious Case of Lord Ran-
dolph Churchill and Mr. Spencer."

Little Brothers come to fill
up Vacancies.
"MARIE-ROZE, THAT'S FOR REMEMBRANCE."
Hamlet, Act IV., Sc. 5.
WELL, that isn't exactly the line, hut
it is "Rose тагу, that 's for remem-
brance," and SHAKSPEARE, who was as
much for this age as his own, would, had
he been alive now, certainly have written
the line, on this occasion, as Mr. Punch
has given it above. With this explana-
tion, Mr. Punch fortwith sends hie
heartiest congratulations to Madame
MARIE-ROZE on her success as Elsa in
Lohengrin, at Sheffield,—a full account of
the performance having been forwarded to
himЪу his old friend ' ' BROOKSOÍ Sheffield,"
—and on the enthusiastic ovation which the
operatic Rose, in full bloom all the year
round, received at Leeds. Mr. Punch has
"Pleased as Punch." not yet heard the fair singer as Eisa, but he
has heard her in almost everything Else, Sir. He awaits her return
to town with feverish anxiety, and, once again quoting the im-
mortal and ever-adaptable Bard, he exclaims, "MABIE, come up!'

A RENT IN THE CLOUDS.
THE following additional Clauses to the "Plan of Campaign,"—
advocated by the Irish National League, are, we believe, on the point
of being promulgated :—
1. An evicted tenant shall be at liberty to live in the cottage of
another evicted tenant, as the latter will nave no further use for it.
2. An evicted tenant shall live upon the profite of the farm from
which he has been driven out, instead of giving it as heretofore to
his landlord.
3. The tenants of an estate having decided to pay no rent to a
landlord, shall bring it to his agent when he is not at home and offer
it to him.
4. If the agent not at home refuses to accept this offer, then
the money thus brought shall be paid into the hands of the Committee,
who shall be at liberty to apply it in payment of the rent of those
tenants who have no rent to pay.
5. A tenant who has satisfied himself that he ought to pay nothing
to his landlord, shall, if already destitute, pay it to the Committee
instead, so that it might be held in trust for the support of himself,
his wife, and their poor orphan children.
6. In the event of a landlord, or his agent, breaking any of the
above rules, whether they apply to them or whether they do not
apply to them, then no tenant shall allow such landlord, or his agent,
to speak or to listen to them, unless the said landlord, or his agent,
happens to be deaf and dumb, when the affliction they are suffering
shaU be considered to be sufficient punishment for their offence.
7. None of the above regulations, orders, and restrictions shall of
course be construed to apply to the pigs.
"QUI S'EXCUSE."
THE recent profusely apologetic explanation volunteered by the
SULTAN in excuse for his inability to pay his respects to the Duke of
EDINBURGH, owing to the fact of his "not being able to get on his
coat," has led to the publication of the following diplomatic tariff,
that may be found useful to exalted personages who are contemplating
a passing visit to the Sublime Porte :—
Not being "at home" to a Practically invisible, owing to
friendly early call. being temporarily dressed in
slippers and coloured dressing-
gown.
Neglecting to return same. Mislaying gloves and walking-
stick.
Being "out" to formal after- Having nothing fit to appear in
noon call. owing to disappointment on the
part of tailor in not sending home
new things.
Postponement of grand official Waiting arrival of new evening-
banquet, dress boote.
Not coming round to see dis- Inability to borrow an ulster
tinguished guest previous to his andan umbrella from the grand
departure. Vizier or some other member of
the household.
MAST hard things have been said about Mr. GOSSE. Perhaps the
Liverpool Post excels all by its brief yet comprehensive announce-
ment—" Mr. GOOSE promises a complete answer to the attacks of the
Quarterly Review."
TO Ci IK RESPONDENTS.—In no case can Contributions, whether IIS., Printed Hatter, or Drawings, be returned, unless accompanied
by a Stamped and Directed Env lope or Cover. Copies of MS. should be kept by the Senders.

Carlton Club, Monday.

E AB Товг,
THANXS for your kind note. The
situation is, as you say, a very
difficult one for me, full of embar-
rassment and disappoinment. Of
course I am, as 1 said at Brad-
ford, a sincere admirer of RAN-
DOLPH. I cannot, it ie true, speak-
ing of him in a political sense, say
that he is "a most respectable
person." But lie has many pri-
vate virtues and some public ones.
He is an indefatigable worker.
His publie appearances are con-
fined to the platform of the House
of Commons. But I have reason
to believe that he is a regular
contributor to at least two periodi-
cals widely differing in character.
He writes in the Daily Newt
under the nom de plume of
"METEOB,", and he is a regular
contributor to Mr, Punch's waste-paper basket.
I am bound to say this from a sense of fairness. Whatever is to be placed
to his credit, do not let me of all men, hide under a bushel. But I do not
think I have anything to add on that score. Regarded generally, he is a
terrible scourge, and has played the doose with me and other eminent and
respectable members of the Conservative Party. I remember, as it were
but yesterday, when he used to sit below the Gangway with GOBST and
WOLFF, and I used to frown upon him, and flout him from the corner bench
behind our respected chiefs. He was not very respectful to me even in those
days, and I well remember how one night he turned upon my Right Honour-
able friend Sir ROBEBT FOWLER, then actually Lord Mayor of LONDON, and,
as it were, rent him to pieces, amid mocking laughter. FOWLER has never
got over that night, and now he is in Japan. GOBST and WOLFF having
done RANDOLPH'S bidding, are comfortably provided for. He is at the top
of the tree, whilst I meekly sit on a platform supporting him with my
presence and avowing my admiration for his'statesmanlike speech.
This is very bitter, dear TOBT, and it is only in the privacy of correspon-
dence with a sympathetic soul like you that I can unburden myself. But
think for a moment of my position. I was a personage in the House of Com-
mons before RANDOLPH'S face was known there. I carefully, and I may say
with come success, modelled my style on that of another respected leader of
the Party. When Mr. DISBAELI was removed from the House of Commons,
I felt my time was near at hand. STAFFORD NOBTHCOTE, of course, must
have his turn. But after him there was none on the Front Bench to dispute
Parliamentary precedence with me. Then, out of nothing, coming from no
whither, springs up this impudent sprite—I mean this patriotic Statesman,
who walks over us all, kicking and trampling, and coolly taking the highest
place at the table.
If one might have free scope for vituperation, the situation would be
bearable. If I might stand up in the House of Commons, or on the platform
at Bradford, and for fifteen minutes frankly discuss RANDOLPH CHURCHILL,
I should feel better. But it won't do. We 've tried it before. I took my
part in the attempt to oust him from the Chairmanship of the Caucus. But
he suddenly dined with the Markise, squared things all round, and left us in
the lurch. He took his fling, not only with persons, bnt with the Party. A
year ago we were Conservatives. To-day we are pledged to carry out a more
complete Radical programme than GLADSTONE ever ventured to prepare; and
then the movements are so sudden. I didn't know till I had
left the platform at Bradford that I was not going to he
pledged to the principle of community of portable property,
or to that of "the tramways free as air to working men."
That may come any day.
In the meantime, what is to be done? ASHMEAD BAB.T-
LETT proposes that we should take a leaf from history.
"He's worse than PEEL at the time of the Corn Laws,"
he says. "You be Lord GEORGE BENTINCK, and I '11 be
Mr. DISBAELI, and we '11 worry him to death." That sounds
plausible. I think I could answer for the BENTINCK part
of the transaction, but the DISBAELI is not so certain. I
don't know what I shall do, but I feel I cannot long stand
this racket of humiliation. Sometimes I wish I had avoided
politics, and gone into the Church. I would have become
the costume, and I flatter myself my oratorical style would
have taken in the pulpit. These are, however, vain regrets,
and I can only threaten opposition on the Closure question.
But, between you and me, TOBT, I fear that there aleo I '11
cave in, and RANDOLPH will have his way.
Yours, despondently, H-NBT CH-PL-N.
AMONG Messrs. WABD AND DOWNET'S re-issues are several
of Mr. FABJEON'S thrillingly interesting romances. He has
been trying his hand at a Christmas Book for Boys, which
Mr. Punch has given to a youthful critic, whose opinion is
worth having, if judged by the excellent one he has of him-
self. In the meantime, as to the present re-issue, who pos-
sesses these—The Mystery of Great Porter Square, Grif,
and The House of White Shadows, may be considered a very
Farjeonate person.

[" So spiteful, y'know! Just because I'd kept him waiting a minuit or two!"
COMMERCE VEßSUS CREMORNE.
WHAT COÍIMEBCE SATS.
"BUSINESS first, Pleasure afterwards," is an old and excellent
motto. And when the business is Imperial business, on such a
colossal and comprehensive scale as it must be to embrace the mani-
fold relations of mutual affection and interest between Great Britain
and her world-scattered Colonies and Dependencies, the motto applies
with more than usual fulness and force.
For great occasions, great enterprises! A Royal Jubilee does not
occur every year, or even every century. Ten thousand additional
tea-garden lamps will not suffice to mark what must be so memorable,
and may be so fruitful a conjuncture.
No one has anything to say against the pleasant 'illuminated
popular shows which South Kensington has seen during several suc-
cessive years, culminating in the splendid and suggestive "Colin-
deries" of the past season. The public has been mightily pleased
with them, and, quite properly, thankful to all, from the РВШСЕ
downwards, who have helped to provide them.
But a Jubilee means more, marks more, and demands more than
the best arranged combination of Exhibition and Pleasure Gardens
can supply. The Empire is something more than a popular Show,
and Commerce cannot make her home at Cremorne. The Higher
Imperialism has laid hold of the public imagination. The unification
of the heterogeneous items constituting what is known as the British
Empire is the dream and the desire of all. Federation is in the air.
At this moment comes a rare and a striking opportunity of doing
something practical on a large scale and in permanent fashion, in the
direction of our desire, and towards the realisation of our dream.
It is above all things to be desired that the opportunity should not
be missed, nor—what is of almost more importance—misused.
Commerce, speaking gravely and earnestly in the name of the
larger and more abiding interests of the Empire, demands that the
Jubilee Institution, whatever form it may assume, shall be large in
its scope and abiding in its influence.
An imperial Institution—call it "Colonial Museum," "Imperial
Commercial Museum," or what you please—which shall he a compre-
hensive, orderly, easily accessible display of the realms and the
resources of the Empire, a centre of intelligence, a bond of sympathy,
a nucleus of co-operation, would answer to that ideal.
Shows and thronging sight-seers, Bands and Refreshment-Booths,
Coffee-Stalls and Coloured Lamps, the Crystal Palace without its
acrobats, and Cremorne without its dancing, will not.
The Imperial Institution to be worthy of its great occasion, and to
subserve its large ends, must be largely conceived, carried out in a
spirit of cordial co-operation with the representatives of all the
interests involved; and—last, not least—suitably and conveniently
localised.
South Kensington, whatever its merits and its charms, is not the
unquestioned centre of the Empire, nor the undisputed nub of the
Commercial Universe.
To help carry out this grand and fruitful Imperial Commemoration
in the spirit, and with the aims above set forth, is a task worthy of
the most strenuous and unselfish, the most far-seeing and lad-
sacrificing efforts of every thoughtful patriot, and especially a
thoughtful patriot who is also a popular Г ш хек.
It is thus, that Commerce speaks on this great occasion.
Mr. Punch says ditto to Commerce. Or rather he puts, in his own
inimitable way, views which are his own, and which he is sure
Commerce does, and the PEINCE will, share with him. And the PRINCE
and Commerce, of course, will say ditto to Mr. Punch!
BOOKS MITCH WARNK-TKD.—A set of Standard Novels has just
been brought out by Messrs. WABIÏE. Bless their old faces! Among
them are Mr. Punch's ancient ventriloquial friend, Valentine Vox.
then Rory O'More by LOVER, and Jack Hinton by LKVKK, and
Ernest Maltravers by BULWER, and Peter Simple by MARBYAT, and
other tried companions of former years, who have as much life in
them as they had when Mr. P. first had the pleasure of making
their acquaintances. The delight these worthies will give to a new
generation will soon show that though brought out by Messrs. WAHNE,
they are not by any means Warne out.

AFTER THE PLAY.
SCENE—Mr. Punch's Sanctum. Mr. PUNCH and Mr. NIBBS
discovered.
Mr. Punch. I saw you at the St. James's, Mr. NIBBS.
Mr. Nibbs. I was there, Sir, at your Benevolence's request.
Mr. P. Strict attention to duty merits a continuance of favours.
I went to weV'ime Mr. HABE, whose performances always interest
me mightily. He is excellent m this new piece of PDTEBO s.
Mr. N. He is, Sir, admirable. There is no
better acting anywhere just now than Mr.
HABE'S in The Hobby Horse.
Л/А P. Not having been everywhere, 1 can
only bow to the opinion of an expert. What
did you think of the comedy?
Mr. N. Of the ?Oh, I see it is
styled "Comedy" in the bill.
Mr. P. "Comedy " is generic, Mr. NIBBS,
and Dr. JOHNSON has defined it as "Dramatic
representation of a lively kind (as opposed
to Tragedy)."
Mr. N. Yes, Sir, and a Farce he de-
.^^ scribes as "an extravagantly ludicrous
„ .. , , variety of Comedy." Now, Sir, with due
Mr. Punch welcomes «the deference to your opinion. Í maintain that
Hare Apparent. The HMy Horte.—*\aub, by the way,
Mr. PINERO would have done far better to have called the Family
Solicitor, and to have ranked it with The Private Secretary and
The Magistrate,—exactly illustrates the definition you have just
quoted, and is, therefore, a Farce—not, Sir, the French Farce, which
one of their accepted authorities calls "la mère, de notre comédie,
mère aux allure» un peu libres,"—but the English Farce in three
Acts as understood by our nineteenth century playgoers, who cer-
tainly would not look upon it as a comedy of "manners," or of
"character," or of "intrigue." And I should maintain further,
that it is either a Comedy spoiled or a Faroe spoiled, and so it is
neither one thing nor the other.
Mr. P. Yet I laughed so heartily that I should have considered
it ungenerous on my part to have inquired too closely into the
method of their madness. I went to see Mrs. KENDAL and Mr. HABE,
and I really did not care in what they appeared.
Mr. N. Yet, Sir, you have seen Mrs. KENDAL to greater advantage?
Mr. P. Well, Mr. NIBBS. on consideration I admit that the part
she takes seemed unworthy of her tálente. Dramatically it is
nothing at all, and any less distinguished actress could play it with-
out difficulty.
Mr. N. I am glad to hear Your Benevolence allow so much. Mrs.
KENDAL gives the part its importance, but the part does nothing
for her.
Mr. P. True, I am beginning to be more of your opinion every
moment, Mr. NIBBS. Now, tell me—for I did not follow, the details
very attentively—why is it a Farce, or a Comedy, spoiled P
Mr. N. I will be as brief as possible. The piece is irritating.
The motive of the whole action is so desperately improbable as to
belong to the most outrageous kind of Farce, while the characters—
the wife exoepted, who is so entirely moulded, from Act to Act, by
the exigencies of the imbroglio, as to be a fantastic creation beyond
or beneath serious consideration,—are, all of them, allowing for
theatrical exaggerations, so human as to be out of place in such a
preposterous absurdity. That an irreproachable married woman,
whose one peculiarity is a philanthropic hobby for turning her
husband's house into a refuge for little waifs and strays—a notion
evidently derived from the domestic history of a certain lady, whose
frequent appearance in our law-courts has made the public familiar
with her name and peculiarities.—should suddenly leave her home,
and, under an assumed name, live for ten days in the house of a
bachelor curate in Whiteohapel, is in itself outrageously. im-
probable.
Mr. P. And therefore farcical.
Mr. N. Decidedly. Especially as her object could have been
obtained by fair means. Deceit would have been abhorrent to an
impulsive and generous disposition, and especially so to a correct
person like Mrs. Jermyn, who is represented as shuddering at an
expletive, and who objects to the mention of ADAM and EVE,
"before the boy." Then, Sir, that the bachelor curate, who is a
mashing young muscular Christian, with a tenor's beard and mous-
tache, and a great display of spotless wristband, should fall in love
with her, is natural enough.
Mr. P. Decidedly. I fancy I should have done the same myself.
humant nihil altenum.
Mr. N. A noble sentiment, Sir, and worthy your Philosophic
Benevolence. But that this quick-witted lady, should not within
ten days have perceived the reverend masher's development
of amativeness is as unnatural as his passion is natural.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Where was Missis when the Kendal was out—of it?
Mr. P. I own it struck me she was rather coquetting with him—
and had it been a French piece
Mr. N. Quite so, Sir, I anticipate the moral of your just
observation.
Mr. P. By the way, I trust Mr. Ккмп г. is not unwell, as I was
puzzled to
know why
he had not
been cast
for the part
of the stal-
wart young
curate,
which, it is
no dispar-
agement of
Mr. WAK-
ING's excel-
lent per-
formance,
down to
the ground.
Mr. N.I
am not in
the secrets
of the St.
Jame s's
Manage-
ment,
otherwise I might be able to tell you how it came about that The
Hobby-Horte assumed its present form. My theory is that Mr.
PINEBO presented a farce, and that the absence of all serious interest
was considered a fatal objection to its success at the St. James's.
The obliging author agreed to introduce this element, and—spoilt the
Farce. Imagine a serious pathetic interest being suddenly Brought
into Box and Cox! Say, for instance, that a passion inspired by
Mr». Bouncer should divide the long-lost brothers, and that a strong
situation were reached by the unexpected return of Mr. Bouncer
to witness the infidelity of his spouse! Would this serious element
improve the farce? or would it not rather be utterly out of place,
and the farce spoilt by the introduction?
Mr. P. Such an incongruous mixture would be, ordinarily, a
fatally inartistic blunder. Still, there are exceptions
Mr. N. It is like Your Benevolence to say so, yet I do not see
that The Hobby Horse is one of them. But permit me to continue.
Mr. P. And finish? With pleasure.
Mr. N. I take your hint, Sir. Well, Sir, that finally the lady's
husband, Mr. Jermyn, who is a vigorous, impetuous, manly old
English sportsman, to whom the notion of anyone not going straight
is detestable, and the offender unpardonable, should forgive his wife's
conduct, and should accept as a friend and neighbour the amorous
and reverend gentleman m whose house his wife has secretly passed
ten days, whom he has actually seen embracing his wife, and on
whom he must look as his youthful and handsome rival, and so
consent to figure as le plu» heureux des trois, is the crowning
absurdity of these improbabilities, all admissible in English Farce,
but not in an English Comedy, which should represent typical men
and women, involved in a natural sequence of complications arising
out of some highly probable mistake.
Mr. P. I see. It is a farce played by excellent comedians as a
comedy.
Mr. N. Except by Mrs. KEKDAL, who as a leading Comedy actress,
can find nothing to grip in such a nonsensical character, and so plays
it, bit by bit, sham earnestness and real frivolity, with an evident
consciousness of its absurdity.
Mr. P. It is a sort of patch-work. Mrs. TREE is good.
Mr. N. Very. She has to represent the not remarkably original
part of a gushing young lady, and to act acting. Her effusiveness
about a Solicitor—which becomes somewhat wearisome on repetition—
is suggestive of the peculiar burlesque type of which the patent
belongs to Mr. GILBERT.
Mr. P. Mr. MACKINTOSH and Mr. HENDRIE, as the broken down
Welshers, are, a trifle exaggerated, but still excellent.
Mr. N. They are. Sir. But can you imagine a hard-headed ex-
perienced old Turfite like Mr. Jermyn being taken in by a pair of
such transparent impostors?
Mr. P. Well, no, except in Farce.
Mr. N. Exactly, Sir.
Mr. P. Miss WEBSTER is a charming ingenue, and as for the Mrs.
Porcher of Mrs. GASTON MURRAY,—(the lady was a lovely Fair
Kotamond at the Olympic—with a delicious voice)—she might
have stepped right out of Èarchester Tower», and claimed ANTHONY
TROLLOP к as her author.
Mr. Ж It is all excellently played. Mr. MELLISH as Tom Clark
began capitally, but, being encouraged, he overdid the boyishness of
the young sailor. Criticism apart, it is well worth seeing. It is some
time since I have laughed so heartily as I did at Mr. HABE as
Spencer Jermyn. In such a part as this he is simply unapproach-
able, and inimitable.
Mr. P. Come, we have to thank Mr. PINERO for something.
Mr. N. For much, Sir. But what would The Hobby Horse be
without its present interpreters?
Mr. P. The town would soon cry, "For 0, for 0, the Hobby-
Horse is forgot I"
Mr. N. But as it all turns on the silence of the weak Solicitor,
Pinching,—a clever performance this of Mr. SOMERSET'S,—and as
Pinching could really have upset it all at any moment, why Mr.
PINEBO didn't call it The Solicitor
Mr. P. Perhaps he has another in hand with that title. But
anyhow I have to thank him for his share in giving "me a very enjoy-
able evening. Au revoir, Mr. NIBBS, au revoir!

Mephittopheles. Well, no. I passed his place,
but did not stop.
I do not fancy he 'd have much to say,
Being a deep and diplomatic gent,
Save general greeting and bald compliment.
Unless I err, as we drew near.
We heard some practised voices pealing.
A song must admirably here
Re-echo from this vaulted ceiling.
Altmayer. Give us one then.
Mephistopheles. Oh, well, I '11 do my best.
Frosch. And let it have a chorus for the rest.
Mephistopheles (sings) :—
Once on a time a Party
Possessed a clever—midget,
The which they fondly treasured,
Though oft it made them fidget.
Their tailor then they summoned,
The tailor to him goes;
"Measure me," says the youngster,
"For collar, breeks, and hose."
Altmayer. Let him the tailor strictly charge,
The nicest measurement to take,
And, as he loves his head, to make
The collar neat, and not too large!
Mephistopheles. In togs too large and loose
for him,
Behold the younker drest,
With hugje sharp-pointed collars,
Projecting o'er his breast.
They Party Leader made him,
His influence was so great,
And all his poor relations,
Held offices of State.
The fogies and old ladies,
Were dreadfully distrest;
The Premier and his henchmen,
Were bitten by the pest.
And yet they dared not show it,
Or chase the midge away.
Midge-worship is во catching,
The cultus of the day.
Chorus (shouting).
Midge-worship is so catching, &c.,
Altmayer. Who now that midge shall catch
and kill?
Brander. Hurrah for wine and Union still!
Mephistopheles. Were but your wine of a
superior tap,
A glass to Union I 'd gladly drain.
Frusch. Well turn us on a better one, old
chap.
And we will join you in a loyal strain.
Faust (aside]. Humph! If he tipples, I per-
force must follow.
And what a mouthful I shall have to
swallow!
Mephistopheles. Fetch me a gimlet! Now,
what will you take P
Altmayer, How mean you? Have yon wine
of every sort Y

THANKS to Mr. AMBBOSE AUSTIN, Иг. Punch had another chance of
hearing Mme. ADELINA PATTI once again, on Wednesday last, before
leaving for America. Mr.
Punch is always delighted to
see Mr. CTSIXS acknowledging
his reception, shooting out his
immaculate wristbands, squar-
ing his shoulders, expanding
his chest, and setting himself
to work as if in conducting an
orchestra he was going in for a
pugilistic match against Time,
and was determined to beat
the old chap hollow. "One
tune down, t'other come on,"
seems to be Mr. CUSINS' defiant
and triumphant motto. As the
American Droll who was at
the Gaiety last summer would
say, "He 's so English, you
know." And this Mr. Punch
records to his praise. The
grand-voiced Mr. HENSCHEL
magnificently, yet Mr. Punch

"Au revoir!"
eang "Revenge! Timotheus cries.
is fain to admit that he has had something too much of TIMOTHY, and
hopes not to hear of him and his revenge for some considerable time.
Miss HILDA. WILSON was recalled after BEETHOVEN'S " Creation
Hymn," but at this moment the vast audience was occupied less with
the "hymn" than with the " her," for ADELINA was the next on
the list. In excellent voice—she never was in better—she gave an
aria from Rigoletto in the most captivating manner, and then, by
•way of response to the enthusiastic encore, she sang " Within a Mile
of Edinboro' Town" in such a style as would have brought all the
inhabitants out of Edinboro' for miles round to listen entranced, and
not to begrudge that " bang went saxpence" to the sweet singer.
Mr. CABBODUS after the " Rondo Papageno," from a Magic Flute
theme by ERNST, was "called," and returned, diffidently. Mr. BABTON
McUucKix sang instead of SIM REEVES, and, needless to say, met
with a most gratifying reception.
The Meistersinger overture left Mr. Cueras once more triumphant
and fresh for another encounter. ADELINA then sang the brilliant
O luce di quest 'anima "—which would have given Lord RAN-
DOLPH a chance for another pun about a lucé'd style—(it wasn't bad
for a Chancellor of Exchequer, and proved that he had carefully read
Mr. Punch's review of Mr. LUCY'S Tico Parliaments. Very good,
у our Lordship!)—and in return for the inevitable encore, she sang
"Comin' thro' the Rye." This the audience cheered to the echo, and
there is still an echo in the Albert Hall, which some mean folks
consider an advantage, as it gives them more for their money.
Then Mr. HENSCHEL sang " Gazing round upon this fair Assembly,"
with which the fair assembly seemed remarkably pleased.
Mr. ESOEL, composer, critic, journalist, and accompanist, then
appeared on the scene in such a pleasant and casual sort of way as
to buggest the idea of his having been accidentally passing, when, on
hearing sounds of revelry within, he just.looked in to see if he
could be of any service, and had then and there been collared by
Mr. Cusras, and taken straight to the harmonium, where, being alone
for awhile on the platform, he appeared as the Incomplete Engle-r,
until to him entered SIGXOE NICOLINI, to sing "Noël," a song composed
most appropriately by "ADAM." The vocalist reached a top-note
that caught the audience, and they had him. back to do it again,
when once more he reached the giddy height successfully.
Then, as a farewell, ADELINA sang " The Last Rose of Summer,"
followed by "Someßweet Home," and after this Mr. Punch over-
come by his feelings, could bear no more. Mastering his emotion, he
left the theatre with his own overcoat, hat, and stick, threw himself
into his brougham and did not absolutely recover until he had quaffed
a class of sparkling nectar, in honour of the Diva on the occasion of
this latest of the Nodes Ambrosiana:.

"WHAT of the Night?" 0 Denial gracious " Saturday,"
Mean yon the night in which your mind'в involved,
Time-mellowed " slasher" of this milder latter-day?
If so, your little puzzle soon is solved.
That night is starless, moonless, tenebrifie,
And unillumined e'en by fancy's ray.
The mental darkness surely is terrific
Which will not give imagination play.
Nox must have turned a tyrant harsh, supreme,
When he won't even let his victim dream.
The old Astronomers were less unfortunate,
They patterned out the sky at their sweet will.
Think you the claims of fact are so importunate
That fancy may not take some licence still '(

"THIS VILLANOUS SALTPETRE!"
So difficult, when you 're calling anywhere, to begin your conversa-
tion effectively, Quite grateful to this afternoon for being the Fifth.
Eater a drawing-room full of ladies and children, and glide grace-
fully into the talk, directly I sit down, with reference to " Guys "—
any other afternoon it might seem rude—to-day it 's merely appro-
priate. Guys a capital subject—we really don t seem able to get
away from them, everyone describing Guys she has met. Pretty girl
opposite tells how she met a hideout one three Novembers ago, and
will never forget him as long as she lives. Happy Guy! If only
she would remember me like that!
Conversation languishes—revive it judiciously with allusion to
fireworks. Talk fireworks till I'm really startled at my own bril-
liancy. See I 've made an impression. When I rise to go, in blaze
of my own red fire, hostess wonders "whether Mr. TIHMERHAN
would care to stay and help us out in our little festivities this
evening—it would be so kind, wouldn't it, FLORENCE?"
FLORENCE is the pretty girl—I believe I 'm dining out somewhere—
but I '11 stay. She shall learn to know me in Dumb-Crambo!
After tea, discover it's not Dumb-Crambo — it's fireworks. As
the only man, I 'm afraid they "11 expect me to let them off. I don't
care to explain, after talking so familiarly about them, that the
explosion of the mildest bon-bon invariably makes me jump like a
rabbit, but, as a matter of fact, I 'm like that. Confound my fatal
brilliancy! ....
I knew they would—they have selected me to deal with these com-
bustibles. I dare say they don't mean it, but it is trespassing on my
good-nature. Why can't they hire a fellow to do it P
In the hall. Bo; s bring up box full of dangerous explosives.
"Mr. TISIMERMAN, isn't this a Chinese Flower-Pot P" "No;
Mr. TIMSIERMAN, it 's a Devil-among-the-Tailors, isn't it?"
Whichever it is, I would rather they wouldn't hold it just under
my nose! And rattling the box about like that, too, when the
slightest jolt—but perhaps I 'm thinking of dynamite. Fancy the
boys have found out I 'm afraid, already.
Pitch-dark outside. Good. Nobody at the windows will notice
who lets off what. Shall get round a corner, and look on quietly.
Mustn't be selfish—it 's the boys' treat
Some officious fool has brought out a stable-lantern. Discovered!
Now to dissemble !" Who-oop! Hooray! Here 's a frolic, boys,
hey?" Shall let somebody else begin. Wish there was a Professor
of t his kind of thing, Practical Pyrotechny in 'Six Easy Lessone.
I 'd go—if he 'd lecture on the lawn, and let me take notes indoors.
As things are, best way is to find out the fireworks with least
foolery about them—and stick to them. Portfires now P Never
heard of anyone blowing himself up with a portfire .... there, it's
easy enough, if you hold it well away and phew ! they might
have told me it was a squib!
"Mr. TI.MMEKMAN, please come and hold this Roman candle for me
—it ought to shoot up those pretty coloured balls, oughtn't it? but I
can't get it to begin." It 's the pretty girl! thought she was indoors
—girls should leave these matters to men!
Either this Roman candle is faultily constructed, or else I 've been
holding it the wrong way up—otherwise I should hardly have got
two of the pretty coloured balls down my arm! Think the rest
touched up the family dog, and serve the beast right 1 ....
What? let off those rockets! no, no—I mustn't monopolise all the
fun, let one of the boys do it—it seems they don't like to. And boye
are supposed to be so plucky!
If I must, I must, as they 've evidently got into their heads that
I 'm a kind of Fire King, or a Salamander.
Rockets all in a row, tied to small stakes awaiting ascension—like
martyrs. Poor little things! Lucky someone blew the lantern out
just then—gave me time to spike six of them, now if nothing happens
I can say they 're damp.
Perhaps I had better discharge an able-bodied one, or they '11 think
it so odd—here goes—stand away—it's started! Stick suddenly
slants in my direction ....
I 've no doubt it breaks, as Тшпшкш says, "molten into flakes of
crimson, or in emerald ram "—but I don't see it, I am looking the
opposite way, and unless I am much mistaken, most of the crimson
and emerald, rain is lodged in my coat-tail pockets—don't see any-
thing to laugh at—they may let off the other rockets themselves,
that is, if they can!

Nothing will suit Miss FLORENCE now but that I should undertake
the firing of a maroon. / know a maroon—a beast of a thing that
explodes like a whole park of artillery!
There was a sailor marooned on " Treasure Island"—but I'm not
going to be marooned, if I know it. Most dangerous and improper
performance with all these children about—in my opinion.
There! In spite of all that Bénirai fire, I don t think any one
noticed me burying that maroon. Perhaps it will come up some
warm day next summer—startling at a garden-party. Shall decline
out-door invitations here.
"Look here, you boys, I tell you what—it'a not gentlemanly to

my legs, "silver showers" falling down my neck, "devus" and
"golden flowerpots," and all the rest of their infernal nonsense
whizzing round my head—crashes, and howls, and shrieks! Well,
they 've no one but themselves to blame 1
Get up, and glance round cautiously—garden looking, and smell-

"So," says Miss FLORENCE, coming up with a laugh I don't
like, "you let off more than anybody else—after all.'" I 'm afraid
she diil see me with the maroon!
Shall I go in and be thanked? With my hair in powder (gun-
powder), hands black, smouldering coat-tails, no more eyebrows
than a phrenological bust, and a pervading savour which is simply
diabolical—I think perhaps not.
Better taste to leave quietly, under the circumstances, only I
wish I could feel more certain that the pretty girl will keep quiet
about that maroon.
Ah, well, I shall have no difficulty in remembering this Fifth of
November!
"SAINT LUDMILA."
MESSES. NOVELLO'S recent Oratorio Concert was devoted to the
performance of DVORAK'S Saint Ludmila, and drew a very large
audience. The work consists of three parts, involving constant em-
ployment for the soloists, who were on tnis occasion Madame A LHAN i,
Miss HOPE GLENN, Mr. LLOYD, and _Mr. SAKTLEY. The Oratorio is
apparently designed to suit the English public, and is, perhaps, none
the worse for containing here and there suggestions of HANDEL and
MENDELSSOHN. On the other hand, some' numbers are particularly
original and ingenious, the chorus, No. 11, "Hark, what can be the
noise f" and many others, being masterpieces of descriptive treat-
ment both of voices and orchestra. Madame ALBANI and Miss HOPE
GLENN (the latter being unusually perfect in the contralto part)
were in admirable voice, as was also Mr. LLOYD. The bass music
allotted to Mr. SÍNTLEY seemed at times a little lower than he
cared to go, but altogether the rendering was most satisfactory,
and highly appreciated. The band played well, and the difficult
choruses were, on the whole, admirably sung.
The composer was certainly in love
with his libretto, when setting it to
music; each line is dwelt upon, reit-
erated, and evidently only relin-
quished with regret. This makes
the Oratorio a lengthy affair, and
considerable as are the cuts " made
since its production at Leeds, there
is room to curtail it even further.
Once more we feel constrained to
ask, why are Concerts always too
long? This is one of the things
which No Fellow can understand—
perhaps NOVELLO can. A fine pro-
gramme is announced for the next
Concert of the series on November 23,
when GOUNOD'S third Messe Solon-
nclle andSirABTHTTR's GoldenLegendwui be heard. Messrs. NOVELLO,
Mr. Punch heartily wishes every success to EWEK undertaking!
CAUTION,— One week the Saturday Review ventured to question
Mr. Punch's arrangement of the stars in his sublime Cartoon. The
very next week the Saturday Review got a heavy blow in the Court
of Queen's Bench, which made it see 300 stars, each one shining like
a newly-minted sovereign. Strange this, but true, and carries an
obvious moral with it.

[NOVEMBER 6, 1886.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH'S STUDIO.
I.—CAPTAIN CANNON, UNATTACHED.
MOST Clubmen in London
know a tall middle-aged
soldierly-looking man with
hat tilted over his eyes, and
the stump of a cigar held
constantly between his
teeth. His name is CAN-
NON—Captain CANNON. He
has commanded men in the
tented field before now, but
has been so long "about
town," that were it not for
his military title, one would
forget the Service had ever
claimed him for its own. On
a fine sunshiny morning,
some few months ago, this
civilian warrior entered a
Stock-broker's office and
asked for the principal
partner.
"Mr. ТАГЕ, Sir, is ill—
away to-day," replied a
clerk who stood behind a
mahogany counter, upon
which was strewn a num-
ber of financial journals and
share - lists; "but Mr.
CHARLES is in."
"Then I will see Mr. CHARLES." And CANXON was shown into a
email inner room, walled chiefly with ground-glass windows. The
Captain tapped his walking-stick unconsciously on the floor, and
passed his baud across his bleared eyes and weary brow. Ho had
the appearance of having been up all night. He spoke with impa-
tience, and yet his words came out with a drawl, as if his thoughts
were rather sluggish and were disinclined to find verbal utterance.
He was between fifty and sixty, pale, slim, and wiry. There was
a faint suggestion of LEECH'S Swell of twenty years ago in his frock-
coat with its very long skirt, and his check sailor-cut trousers. As
he was kept for a few moments waiting, he drew out his pocket-
book and looked with a frown through the pages.
"Sorry my father is away," said Mr. TAPE, Junior, entering
briskly. He was a dapper young gentleman, who, after five, haunted
some of the best of the West End third-rate Clubs. "He is ill."
"Very sorry to hear it," replied the Captain, shaking hands;
"but I daresay you '11 do as well. Look here. Your people have
put me in a nice hole! How about Esquimaux Rails? I was nearly
knocked out of time when I saw the tape at the Club last night.
Q-one down three! Made me trump my partner's best card. Haven't
done such a thing for twenty years! So I got up before breakfast
to see what it was all about. What i» it all about?"
"Well, the fact is, I believe, that the demand for ice is less this
year, and consequently the traffic"
"Oh, drop all that," interrupted the Captain, with an ugly smile,
"but I am rather hurried this morning, and came to talk business.
I suppose it's a Ring that you told me nothing about—oh, I know,
of course you weren't in it—but now the 'Account's' close up. The
question is, shall I carry over?"
And then the two gentlemen discussed some of the greatest ven-
tures of the day, in the spirit of a couple of authorities on racing
matters, considering a sporting prophecy. At length, after ordering
various purchases and sales, the Captain was satisfied, and with the
remark that he thought "his book was now pretty straight, and,
barring accidents, he ought to pull through," took his departure.
He got into his brougham and drove to half-a-dozen offices,
belonging to as many companies. The object of these corporations
were various. The three last he visited will serve as samples of the
rest. One was a Workman's Bank; the next an Association for
"supplying stained-glass windows for Churches, on the co-operative
principle; the third a combination for "introducing imitation
cucumbers (so popular in America) into the United Kingdom."
The Captain strolled into the Board-room of each of these important
Societies, and asked the same question, "Well, what's up?" The
Secretaries (all more or less alike—men looking as if they were doing
nothing in particular, in a careworn and anxious manner) had very
much the same reply, "the new issue was going off slowly,—there
wasn't much demand for it in the market." About the Bank, the
stained-glass windows, and the imitation cucumbers, neither the
Secretaries nor their visitor seemed to care a brass farthing.
After he had got through the list in his pocket-book, he paused
for a good ten minutes lost in a brown study. CANNON was not the
man to bo " down," but still the morning's work had been so un-
profitable that it required all his determination to bear up against
the bad luck that seemed to be setting in steadily against him.
However, he made up his mind at last, and, after some hesitation,
turned his steps towards the office of a Solicitor—"Mr. RICHABD
PLANTAGENET —in a back street off the Strand.
As CANNON walked in there was less jauntiness in his manner, and
he asked for the gentleman he wished to see with something very like
hesitation. A clerk with a nose and lips suggestive of an alien race,
nodded towards an inner chamber, which the Captain entered. The
room contained a few chairs, and one or two deed-boxes, that seemed
(judging from the cobweb covering to the locks) but little used.
"You here !" said Mr. PLANTAQENET (who in spite of his name,
bore a very strong family resemblance to the clerk in the office) in a
tone of surprise, either real, or assumed. "What have you come
for? Now, none of your games. Capting. You know as well as I
do, the Earl has bolted I Yes, bolted, Sir, and a week before I could
touch him!"—The "Capting," murmured something about "his
people settling up."
''Now, nonsensh, Capting," replied Mr. PLANTAGENET with a
strong Jewish accent, "the young man has taken to sheep-farming
or somethink of that sort, and they ain't going to give him another
chance. I don't want to be hard upon you, Capting, because before now
your introductions have been 'all right,' but then I've paid you
handsomely for them—now haven't I, Capting? I don't want words,
and I bear my losses as well as any gentleman in my own line of
bislmesh. But, Capting, as I told you when we first met, I make it
a rule not to have any mistakes—twice! Good morning, Capting."
"Nearly three o'clock and all the morning wasted!" exclaimed
CÍNNON, as he got back into his brougham and ordered the coach-
man to drive West. "By Jove, I must have a mouthful of breakfast,
and then get to serious work!"
An hour later with his hat tilted over his eyes, anda glass of soda-
water and brandy beside him on the table, he sat playing at whist.
The time passed rather drearily. Men looked in and stood round the
tables, some of them assisting in the game by indulging in "outside
bets." CANNON with his pocket-book in front of him entered these
ventures as each game in the rubber was finished. He produced his
cards, which he held below the table, with perfect calmness, now
puffing at a cigar, now sipping from the glass beside him. Once he
cut out as fresn players joined the group, and then seized the oppor-
tunity to dress in the Club, and have a plate of soup, a cut off the
joint, and a pint of wine for dinner. After this pause he was ready
again for his "work," and was soon once more in the room, seated
beside the green-baize table'with its shade-covered candles, its game-
marking counters and its fresh pack of carda. Hour after hour passed.
Men dropped in from the Theatres, stood looking on for a moment,
and then drifted away into other parts of the Club. The waiters
carrying the glasses or the compartment-fitted cigar-boxes, grew
wearier and wearier, the hands of the clock travelled round. Still
the Captain kept his seat with a slip of paper beside him, taking
notes of the games he played as a winner or a loser, and entering in
his pocket-book the outside bets. It was almost daylight when
(after depositing his account in the proper place) he left the Club,
entered his brougham and drove home.
His countenance was a study during that weary drive. The lines
on the forehead, the crows'-feet beside the eyes, had grown deeper.
His lips were firmly set, and the stereotyped smile with which he
had during the past night received his luck, good or bad (it had been
mostly bad), had entirely vanished. It was not easy to read the
thoughts of a man so accustomed to self-control: but, in the privacy
of the carriage, the face of CANNON told of a career all but finished,
a tether nearly at its end. For all that he was calm enough as he
left the brougham, and stood before the door of the chambers he
rented in St. James's Street. He lighted a cigarette with a steady
hand ; then mounted to the third floor and entered his sitting-room.
He paused, and carelessly glanced round. His eyes fell by chance
upon a faded photograph or himself taken in uniform, when full of
hope and pride he had just joined the Service, and long, long before
the time nad come when pressed by debts, he had been forced to
realise the value of his commission. Turning away, he unlocked a
drawer to put back hie pocket-book. His hand accidentally touched
a revolver. He drew the pistol out, and stood looking at it.

A great race has been won, the Bulls have beaten the Bears on the
Stock Exchange, and a new Company has been promoted. A sun-
shiny morning, and some of the riders of the Park are walking their
horses slowly up and down, as they listen to the Cavalry Band outside
the Mess Room of the Knightsbndge Barracks. A phaeton, drawn
by a spanking pair of "steppers," appears on the scene. The driver,
a prosperous-looking gentleman, with a smile on his face and a
flower in his button-hole, raises and lowers his whip hand, as he
smilingly acknowledges a score of salutations. He has all the air of
a'man thoroughly satisfied with the world in general.and himself in
particular. "Do yon know who that is?" inquires a fair Amazon,
And her companion, я staid, magisterial-looking man, replies, with
peculiar emphasis, "Rather. That's Captain CANNON."

HEALTH AT HAMMERSMITH.
IH a communication to the Times, "H. OK C. " has a
pretty story to tell of what he mildly describes as "the
discreditable manner in which parochial duties are carried
on by the Hammersmith Vestry, and how the Committee
of the West London Hospital (now closed on account of
the drains) conduct their affairs at the expense of the
Public." Taking a house belonging to the last-named
institution, on a three years' agreement, with an assurance
that the draina?« was in "perfect order, "the unfortu-
nate correspondent soon learned, to his cost, that the
drainage, instead of being in perfect order, was very
much the reverse, and, after going through the usual
process of being bandied about backwards and forwards
between medical officers of health and sanitary inspectors,
the evil all the while being unremedied, he finally lost a
child from diphtheria, with the result of ultimately
getting his agreement cancelled.
It is quite obvious, therefore, that nothing can com-
pensate "H. G. C." for the irreparable loss he has
sustained, though, we fear, it is not clear how he could,
had he the will, bring the Vestry to book. If the Com-
mittee of the West London Hospital, which is evidently
not at this moment a convalescent one, continue to con-
duct their affairs " at the expense of the public" in the
same enterprising fashion in which they have treated
"H. Oh C., they will run the risk of remaining, like
their own premises, permanently in bad odour,

ME. PUNCH, Sut,—The gravity of what has recently occurred here warrants me, I feel sure,
in addressing you. and laving before you a ease folly as strange as, though less romantic than,
that of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I am butler in a nobleman's family, where I have resided
for upwards of ten years. The other day a young gentleman came to stay in the house. He
was well, though not fashionably, dressed. I have called him a gentleman, and I treated
him as such, little dreaming how unlike one he would prove to be. Instead of deputing a
footman to wait upon him (as I had serious thoughts of doing at first], I myself called him in
the morning, and prepared his bath. It was I who congratulated him (m a deferential manner)
upon the excellence of his shooting—for, the few days he was with us, he fairly astonished the
keepers; it was I who handed him his hat and gloves when, after a week's stay, he took his
departure. You will, I am sure, Sir, consider with me that such attentions deserved
recognition, and that an acknowledgment which took a pecuniary form might, under the
circumstances, best' meet ^the case. On
leaving our house this ¡young gentleman ( ! )
did indeed make me a present. He pressed
a coin into my hand, and the etiquette of
our profession forbids us, as you are doubt-
less aware, to scrutinise money so bestowed
in the presence of the donor. But, when
alone, I glanced at what I had received,
and you may form a faint picture of my
horror when I found that my hand held
nothing more valuable than a single
shilling!
Feeling that silence on such a matter
would be criminal, I have thought it my
duty to trace these lines, and I am yours, &c.

THE BLUE-STOCKING CLUB.
"There is a talk," says the Athenäum, "of
establishing in London a Club for Ladies on the
model of the University Clubs. Membership will
be confined to those who hare studied at Girton or
Newnham, or at Lady Margaret's, or Somervilln
Hall, or have taken degrees atLondon University."
EMANCIPATION of the Sex!
Egad, they 're getting on, that's certain;
A fogey's soul 'twould surely vex,
This Club for Newnham and for Girton.
The world in wonderment will see
No single male within their fortress;
The butler will a spinster be,
And the hall-porter be a portress.
They 41 ape Club life, lay ten to four,
And have a sweep on all the races;
Swift cabs shall stand before the door,
To bear them off to distant places.
From mild cigar or cigarette,
On tiny trays they '11 drop the hot ash;
I wonder will they ever get
As far as whiskey and a potash?
They '11 play at whist, and find it tame,
Without much fashionable prattle,
Not quite " the rigour of the game,"
As relished by great SABAH BATTLE.
O'er billiard-tables they will bow
With grace, and send the swift balls
spinning;
We may not see them; yet avow
A lady's hazards should be "winning."
They '11 gather round the fire at night,
And when she brings the lamps or candles,
The maid will listen with delight
To all the latest little scandals.
"Lord A. 's eloped with Mrs. B."
"Miss C. 's a person most improper ;"
"And as for gallivanting D.,
Her husband can do naught to stop her."
A Ladies' Club! I wonder how
Our great - grandmothers would have
viewed it?
With scorn and corrugated brow
One fancies they would have eschewed it.
But fashions change, and ladies claim
Equality—it 's really shocking;
And since their Club must have a name,
Punch hereby dubg it "The Blue -
Stocking."

You may remember that on Wednesday last, you were kind
enough to suggest that as you were unable to accept an invitation to
dinner for the following day, I should represent you. "They are very
nice people," you observed, "and I think if you have no prior
engagement, you will have a very pleasant evening." I immediately'
assented, expecting to hear that the hosts you had во kindly trans-
ferred to me, lived in South Kensington, or perhaps the Regent's
Park. "Well, no," you replied, when I mentioned those favourite
localities, "not exactly. The fact is, I am, that is to say, you are,
asked to dine in Paris, and yon must start from Victoria at twenty
minutes to ten sharp to-morrow morning." I must admit for the
moment I was flabberghasted, but quickly recovering myself,_ I
accepted my mission. Having for years experienced a strong wish

to give up food-taking, I thought that if I once got to "the gay
city," I might visit one or other of the "fasting men," (perhaps
both) and take a few hints from them anent the beat mode oí carry-
ing out my self-sacrificing, but economical intention.
So, as 9'40 appeared on the clock at the Continental Express plat-
form, I seated myself in a most comfortable saloon carriage and
pondered. I felt a very heavy responsibility—I had to represent you.
Your reputation was so to speak, in my hands, and if I said a foolish
thing or repeated an old joke in your capacity, I knew that incalcu-
lable damage might be done to your prestige. _ Fortunately my
fellow-travellers were as genial as they were intellectual. One
seemed to be known as AUGUSTUS DHUBIOLANUS, another was not only
an accomplished writer, but also an advocate of the highest rank,
(he had defended a great Oriental rebel with consummate tact and
cleverness) and a third was a famous journalist. Need I say that in
such company I, as representing you, was at my best? I sparkled
with your jokes, and some of them, I repeat some of them, my
companions declared they had never heard before.*
We left Dover by the new and admirable steamer, the Victoria,
in a dense fog. It was an anxious moment. Harbour, castle, cliffs,
and sea disappeared. We were lost! Suddenly the cloud lifted, and
we found that the vapour was merely the smoke of the 80-ton gun!
Our gallant bark (I do not know whether a steamboat comes within
the category, but no matter) sped on. Many of those on board were
under the powerful protection of one of the greatest combinations of
modern times—" The International Sleeping-Саг and European
Express Trains Company," and, thanks to the exertions of this pro-
duct of nineteenth-century civilisation, three officers and two privates
of the French Douane had been induced to accompany us with a view
of examining our luggage en route. But, praise bo to Neptune, the
sea was too much for these representatives of the Customs, and
instead of examining the luggage, they lay on their backs on deck,
sipping spirits, groaning, and, no doubt, thinking of their respective
mothers. As a parting salute, when we had got about four miles
across, the 80-ton gun sent a shell after us. It will surprise no one
accustomed to the many shortcomings of the Ordnance Department,
to learn that the missile missed us!
At Calais we were met by our hosts. And now, with your permis-
sion, I will throw off all disguise, and admit that the invitation to
dinner which was given to you, and transferred to me, came from
that noblest outcome of the brightest intelligence, and the truest
philanthropy, "The International Sleeping-Саг and 1 European
Express Trains Company," to which I have already alluded, who,
from the moment of our setting foot upon French soil, took us in
hand, and generally did for us. "We were ushered into some
excellent carriages, of the build of PULLMAN, only more so. We
were invited to partake of an admirable breakfast, and for hours
my view of la belle France was bounded on the North by consommé
aux œufs, on the "West by filet de bœuf, on the East by fin« rouge
et blanc, and on the South by café noir and la chasse. The time
flew, and, before we knew where we were, we were in Paris. The
ordinary tedious journey, so well known to every traveller, disap-
peared, and, in its place, we spent some of the gayest moments
imaginable. Journalists of all shades of opinion fraternised, and
the representatives of the two great English Railway Companies
buried all differences, and, so to speak, fell upon one another's necks
and wept with joy. It was a most touching sight, and I (as your
representative) was most painfully affected.
At Paris (reached at a quarter-past six) we descended, leaving the
admirable train, with all its comforts, to proceed to the South of
France in peace. Two hours later we presented ourselves at the
Café de la Paix, and by haughtily describing ourselves as " Sleeping-
Car-men," were obsequiously shown into a magnificent apartment,
from whence we proceeded to the banquet. Emphatically, the dinner
was a dinner! The rest was silence and a new ballet at the Eden
Theatre. I was not sorry to represent you, and never appreciated
more fully, my dear Mr. Punch, the proud privilege of signing
myself CHAB.LBS—TOUB FBIEND.
* "Very good, my fine fellow," paid Mr. Crummies, shaking his 6et at
the comic countryman, who had spoilt one of Jltn. Cmmmlif finest effects,
"you leave this company neit Saturday night." Mr. Punch truste that " his

TRUE PHILANTHROPY.
this age of selfishness and want of sympathy, it is doubly
gratifying to find a thorough stranger taking sach an amount of
affectionate interest in my personal appearance, as would be some-
what unusual even in a maternal parent. I am not, I am quite
ready to admit, largely blest with personal beauty, but I have passed
through a rather lengthened period of
existence without any of my numerous
friends ever having called my attention
to my special personal defects. In fact,
I should have considered such a pro-
ceeding as somewhat wanting in good
taste, and yet, strange to say, a perfect
stranger has ventured to do so, but
with the kindest and most philanthropic
motives. Having, apparently, been
strack with my somewhat remarkable
Cheering him up. "Hip" Band personal appearance, and ascertained
and Knee Caps. wno I amj ¿e has kindly sent to me a
list of my defects as compared with the type of manly beauty
exhibited to us in the Apollo Belvidere, and has also shown me, in
the clearest possible manner, how they can all be easily remedied!
With what result I need not further explain.
He commences with my figure, which, he somewhat unnecessarily
informs me, is somewhat below the height of ideal excellence ; but,
he somewhat strangely adds, fortunately my legs are not perfectly
straight, therefore, what easier than to straighten them, and so at
the same time increase my stature. How
is this to be accomplished? Nothing
simpler. Merely use Knee Caps and Hip
Bands, and so improve my figure and
increase my height.
My attention is next called to the un-
doubted fact that my fingers do not quite
realise BTEON'S idea when he wrote :—
"For on more thorough-bred or fairy fingers.
Time never set the seal of Gentleman,"


A Night with a Cradle.

A Decided Snub.
they being indeed rather thick and
stumpy. To remedy this sad defect, all
I have to do is to use a trough or cradle, of most ingenious manufacture,
for a few successive nights, when I shall be rewarded with fingers of
exquisite symmetry and nails rivalling the filbert-nut in shape!
1 now come to the most important feature of my face, what my
unknown friend delicately names my
"nasal promontory." This he assures
me is capable of great improvement as
to form, and being most decidedly what
he delicately calls florid in colour, I am
informed, to my great jov, that by
merely applying the Nose Machine to
the cartilage of what I am afraid I must
call my decided snub, it will become not
merely symmetrical, but actually a thing
of beauty, and a joy for ever! while its
florid character will be entirely removed
by merely tightening the pores, thickening the flesh, and making the
sk in more opaque, and all this can be done without inconvenience or
discomfort.
I am much pleased that my eyes, in the opinion of my unknown
critic, are very fine and do not require
any "Eye Colour," and I am beginning
to think that what with my Knee Caps,
and my Hip Bands, and my Finger
Cradles, and my Nose Machine, and its
Florid Eradicator, I shall, when full
dressed for bed, have quite enough
responsibility cast upon me to make a
qniet night's rest somewhat problema-
tical. However, the reward I am to gain
is so great, its success so certain, and
the expense so comparatively trifling, that I feel it a duty I owe to
Society to so improve my personal appearance as to make me, when
entering the halls of my many friends, at any rate one of the observed
of all observers. J. LrretrE.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SELF-PROTECTION.
SIB,—Possessing a valuable plated tea-pot and sundry other costly
articles, calculated to attract the attention of local burglars, the
sudden withdrawal by Sir CHABLES WABREN of Police protection
from suburban residences, has obliged me to take certain precautions
for the defence of my own premises, a brief recapitulation of which
may serve to give confidence to such of your readers as, though
similarly circumstanced, may yet be at a loss to know how to provide
against the contingency of an attack by the professional housebreaker.
The precautionary measures I have adopted are simple enough. To
begin with, I have had all the windows of my house, a detached
villa, standing back from the road in about a quarter of an acre of
shrubbery, provided with WILSON AND HEMMING's Patent Steel-
Roller Blinds, and these which are firmly closed shortly before dusk,
are all connected by electric wires with an indicating Chinese gong
fixed directly under the bed in my sleeping chamber. The slightest
vibration from wind or the passing of a cap down the road, causes a
resounding alarm, and so effectively does it work that I, who sleep
in my boots with a revolver under my pillow and two loaded double-
barrelled rifles by my bedside, have since I have tried the arrange-
ment, been aroused as many as twenty times during the same night
by the repeated summons ; were, therefore, a burglar to present him-
self, I should be well prepared for him.
But these are not the only preventive measures I have taken.
Within my garden in the flower-beds, and in the very path itself, I
have every night set spring dynamite traps that explode on the
sUghtest touch, and the milkman whom I had forgotten to warn, and
my uncle returning from a theatre and mistaking the directions I
hao. given him, both have involuntarily testified to the excellent
working of the apparatus by getting themselves partially blown up
by a too hasty and incautious approach to the front door. Nor does
this complete the list of all I have done for the due protection of
my household, for I have, moreover, purchased a complete police-
man's uniform, in which disguised, and armed with a whistle and
truncheon, I frequently, between the hours of 1 and 5 A.H.,
patrol the immediate neighbourhood, and mark out, and zealously
adhere to my own selected beats.
As yet, my house has not been attacked; but 1 would strongly
urge those of my neighbours who feel as I do that Sir CHARLES
WARREN'S recent fiat has left them at the enterprising burglar's
mercy, to lose no time in providing against a probable contingency
by adopting the preventive measures practised hitherto with com-
plete success by your correspondent, who provisionally subscribes
himself, Your obedient servant, ON GUARD.

A BALLADE FOR THE BUILDER.
GOOD shade of JOHNSON, this way
bend
Your steps; for is there any
doubt,
Were you but here, you'dstraight-
way send,
The bunder to the right-about.
Sor let him come with spade and
pick,
To bring the hoary tables down,
Andof its ancient land-marks trick
The all too unsuspecting town.
So, hither turn; for sure'twere sin,
To cart away Old Staples Inn.
And yet this deed they contem-
plate;
As if, amidst the hue and cry,
All living men must under-rate
The relics of the years gone by.
So let them choose another site,
Their storey'd mansion front to
rear.
If time in bricks must trace its
flight,
Let it not mark its passage
here.
So say, not yet shall they begin,
To cart away old Staples Inn.
LOR' MAYEK'S DAT.
M MATEE has chosen his time well. The Mayor of London gave
his Show on Tuesday, the Ninth, but the MATES of Paris was before-
land with his Show on Saturday, the Sixth. So for thw week, and,
indeed, if the entertainment at Her
Majesty's meets with the success such
an enterprise deserves, for several weeks
to come London will be quite a Mayor's
Nest—the Lord Mayor in the East, and
Her Majesty's MAYER in the West.
Well—"the mair the merrier." Mr.
Punch is able to congratulate the
MAYER of Paris on the company he has
brought over from Paris. As far as the
principals were concerned, the repre-
sentation of Faust was nearly all that
could be desired. Mme. FIDES DEVRIES
looked and sang charmingly as Margue-
rite. M. VERGNET is about as good a
Faust as Mr. Punch can remember; a
trifle stout for the gay rejuvenated
Doctor, but, as the size round the waist
was not mentioned in the bond, perhaps
Mephistopheles, who, on this occasion,
is not the slimmest sprite conceivable,
took his own measurement as a good
"all round" model, and produced a
"robust tenor." Only two better Mephistos than M. DAUPHIN (it
ought to be "Monseigneur," and he played right royally) has
Mr. Punch seen, and, of those two, one was F AUBE. The choruses
were rather weak, but the orchestra excellent. Les Cloches de
Corneville, the best of all modern comic operas, is announced for
Thursday night, and Mr. Punch feels certain that, if the choruses
be well drilled by then, the performance, with M. SIMON MAX and
Mlle. GIRARD in their original parts, ought to be a real treat. Salut,
my Lor' MAYER! ^^__
CELEBRATIONS OF THE бтн OF NOVEMBER.
THJE Quarterly Reviewers carried about an effigy of Mr. GOSSE,
crammed with rubbish and a few fireworks. It had been intended to
explode him altogether, but on consultation it was decided not to let
him off. .
Mr. GEOBGE GROSSMTTH informed our interviewer that, being
carried about all day in a chair, unsteadily, and hearing boys shout-
ing close to his ear was, he found, and speaking for himself alone,
far more trying to the nerves, and infinitely more exhausting, than
playing in one of the Savoy Operas for any number of nights. Of
course to be out in the open air all day was good for his health, but
his only exercise consisted of holding on to the sides of the chair.
Last Friday, he added, was an exceptionally unpleasant day, but
though it rained all the time and was horribly muddy, yet as his feet
never once touched the ground, he was enabled to keep them fairly dry.

"SAINT LUDMÜLA."
MB. PITNCH, in a brief notice of a lengthy
Oratorio, observed last week that "the Com-
poser was certainly in love with his libretto
when setting it to music: each line is dwelt
upon, reiterated, and only relinquished with
regret." This was the effect on hearing it;
but when the libretto itself was subsequently
submitted to Mr. Punch by "a Lover of
Good Music and Common Sense"—"and"
he might have added, "Common Time" —
as the length of this work occupied an uncom-
mon time—who had previously reviewed it in
the Pall Mall Gazette, Mr. Punch feels him-
self bound to give additional emphasis to
his former remark, and say that the Composer
must have been so over-head-and-ears in love
with this libretto, which is quite unworthy
of his passion, as to have become entirely
blind to its glaring faults. So that there
was, as there always is, even in Mr. Punch's
lightest obiter dicta, a far deeper meaning in
Mr. P.'t original observation than would be
at once seized by the merely cursory or the
wilfully obtuse reader.

ГОЕ THE SAKE OF THE LITTLE ONES.
I »CAR MB. PUNCH,
WITH your proverbial kindness yon suggested that I should
undergo a course of "j uvenile amusements," preparatory to the return
of the children from school for the Christmas Holidays, which are
QOW within measurable distance. I consequently looked through the
list of entertainments, and selected amongst others, the Albert
Palace, Battersea Park, where I understood that "The Revels of
Kenilworth in the time of the Good Queen Bess," were to be repre-
sented on a scale sufficiently grand to include the admission of a
Cavalry band with silver kettle-drums, (necessarily) on horseback.
When I had taken my place in the reserved seats of the Circus, I
found myself in the presence of several young gentlemen in full
evening-dress, as worn at Court (tail-coats and knee-breeches), who
were giving what is called a "Drawing-room Entertainment."
Their gorgeous costume was explained by their programme, which
certainly required a saloon only to be found in a Royal palace for its
performance.
One of their " drawing-room" feats, was to make a ladder of them-
selves by standing on one another's shoulders, and then to topple
over en bloc. What would become of the chandelier during this
laring manœuvre, it is difficult to conjecture. However, the enter-
iainment was extremely amusing, and on the whole, more intellectual
either than waltzing or flirting. Another feature was the clever
riding and leaping of Miss BOUBNE, a lady of much grace and courage.
This performance was succeeded by several other very pleasing
terns, including a number of interesting Clowns. I am sorry to say
;hat I did not ascertain the identity of any of these witty gentlemen,
ilthough given every chance by the Master of the Ring, who oblig-
ngly repeated their names very frequently. Thus, when a Clown
lad fallen down, the courteous official with the whip would exclaim,
'Dearme, SNOOKS! We have had a fall, SNOOKS." Upon which
;he Clown would ask some supremely absurd question, which the
Jing-Master would repeat somewhat in this fashion— Can I tell
rou, SNOOKS, why yon are like a mince-pie, SNOOKS, in your present
recumbent position, SNOOKS? No, indeed, I cannot, SNOOKS." And
so on. _ Some of these admirable farceurs had the initials of their
names introduced into their motley, but even this did not help me.
After a vast amount of entertainment of most excellent quality had
been presented to us, the time came for the arrival of the cortège
with the Cavalry band. The musicians made their appearance (their
horses being led by grooms) and the gayest among the gay, was the
player on the silver kettle-drums." This talented performer
seemed to revel in his task, and thumped the parchment with a good
humoured smile, that was absolutely exhilarating.
The "revels were all that they should have been, and their
patronage by "good Queen BESS" served as a proof (if one were
needed) of the great sagacity of that most renowned of sovereign
ladies and stateswomen. There were several " knights" (who appa-
rently had gone to the same costumier for their dresses) who most
obligingly assaulted one another, with the utmost fury, with sticks,
bladders, and other harmless weapons, for the entertainment of the
public. Apart from these gallant gentlemen was an individual in
extremely showy armour, who called himself ".The Black Knight,"
but whose performances were scarcely equal to the anticipation
raised by the magnificence of his apparel. However, taken as a
whole, as I have already said, the entire entertainment was most
satisfactory, and I imagine, as a means for conveying in a pleasing
form historic truths to the young, might, with a little ingenuity, be
easily converted into a highly valuable auxiliary to the School Board.
Besides the Palace of Delights at Battersea, I have been to the
glass-house at Sydenham, where I was pleased to renew my acquain-
tance with Mme. KATTI LANNEB'S pupils in a pleasant ballet. From
this it must not be thought that I danced myself. On the contrary.
I was only (when I was a little regardless of the exact position 01
neighbouring toes in hurrying to the station) the cause of dancing
in others. Yours respectfully,
A PERAMBULATING PLEASUBE-SEEKER.

A NEW TRADE DIRECTORY.
ONE day last week that excellent evening: journal, the
St. James't Gazette, contained a most interesting account
of the family and pedigree of the new Lord Mayor,
who, as everybody knows, ie the Hon. Colonel of the
uoyal London Militia (old style), a Master of Arte of
Cambridge, an old Rugbeian, and most respectable
;radesman somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Tower.
Nowadays, when Socialism is abroad, and Republicanism
rampant, it is most desirable that the tradition» of the
?ast should be preserved. Under these circumstances—
following in the wake of our anti-radical Contemporary
—we are about to compile a Dream of the Counter, which
will serve as a companion volume to that admirable
compilation, The Romance of the Peerage. The follow-
ing is a sample of the scope of the proposed work:—
CROSS-WELL AJTD BLACK. Descended from two gallant
Crusaders, who flourished in the time of EDWAÄD THE
FIRST. On account of their many deeds of valour, they
jointly adopted the Motto of " Pickles."
MAREE AND DATIN. Also descended from the followers
of PETER the Hermit. They invariably wore polished
armour, of a sable hue, and were known for the interest
they took in extending their sway over the blacks.
ËAD AND SWANDER. The ancestor of the first of these
families no doubt was called HEAD, and the prefixed,
aspirate has been lost in the mist of centuries spent in
the atmosphere of British industry. The SwANDERS are
descended from the ancient Romans, to whom, at a
critical moment, were intrusted the defence of the
Capitol. The representatives of BAD AND SWA.NDEÄ
attended WILLIAM THE FIRST on the occasion of his late
Majesty's visit to England in 1066. The yard shaft—the
emblem of these families—is a reminiscence of the arrows
used at the Battle of Hastings.
SOORE AND MAVOUBY. The ancestors of these two
families were renowned for their opposition to the acts of
the Borgias. From this it will be seen that they were
of foreign extraction, belonging, indeed, to a noble
Italian race. They came over to England on the fall of
the Venetian Republic, and the career of their de-
scendants necessitating the mixture of much bitter with
a little sweet, the family motto was gradually assumed,
until it became firmly established. It is unnecessary to
say that the well-known device is Pil admirari.
That the projected volume may be as complete as
possible, contributions are earnestly requested. Letters
should be addressed, To the Editor, Puzzle Department,
85, Fleet Street.
No ORIGINALITY !—It is noteworthy that the only
London bookseller who deals in English dramatic litera-
ture is FRENCH.
WAR'S ALARMS.
THE following brief authentic account of the French Ambassador's
interview with Lord IDDKSLEIGII last week, as accepted by the whole
of the inspired French Press, will probably be read on this side of
the Channel with interest :—
An Apartment in the Sureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
London.
Le Lord Iddesleigh (showing to the door M. RüSTEM PASHA, and
bowing with effusion of welcomes to the Ambassador of France}. And
now, my dear M. WADDINOTON, having put a flea into the ear of my
excellent Turkish friend, tell me what is there I can do for you '{
Pray be seated. (Offers to him an arm-chair.) Ha! I divine
rightly, do I not P It is some little bagatelle of the Fisheries Question
that brings you?
M. Waddington (with a coldness of demeanour]. No, Milord, it is
not a bagatelle of the Fisheries Question that brings me. Nor any
bagatelle, but a matter grave, portentous, and of supreme pressure.
In one word. Milord, I have come to speak to you of Egypt.
Le Lord Iddesleigh (turning pale and proceeding with a smile that
it forced). Of Egypt? Ha! ha! Oh, the subject is quite shocking,
as we say! Ha! ha! and what, my dear Monsieur, have you to
speak to me of about Egypt? ( With eagerness.) The last coupon was
paid in full. Your French Bond-holders received all their interest.
Eh? is it not so, my good friend?
¿f. Waddington (firmly and with incision). It is not Milord, the
French Bondholders that you have to satisfy, but France. Listen,
Milord, France is aggrieved. She is wounded in her honour, and
can no longer endure a position odious and insupportable. She does
not wish to intervene herself. She has other work for her heroic
troops, and conceives another destiny for her glorious flag. But she
can no longer tolerate the presence there of another Power. She feels
it as a humiliation to her pride, an insult to her sovereignty.
Milord, France has made up her mind, and calm and confident in the
justice of her demand, insists on one thing—the Evacuation.
Le Lord Iddesleigh (trembling, and holding, with effort, to the back
of a sofa). The Evacuation! Ah! you surely do not understand,
my good friend. She could not press for that. It is by the will of
United Europe that England disposes of herself as an intermediary.
M. Waddington. And the will of United Europe, Milord, what is
it but the will of France? Make attention. Russia, she occupies
herself with Bulgaria, and Austria she mixes up herself also in that
affair. Italy is of no import'; while M. de BISMARCK has given to
us the friendly nod. There is no escape. France insists.
Le Lord Iddesleigh. But she will surely wait the report of my
friend, Sir WOLFF? He is instituting an investigation that will be
to our deliberations an assistance at once useful and efficacious.
M. Waddington. France will wait for nothing. It is essential to
her dignity that she should receive a reply explicit and categorical.
What, Milord, is your answer?
Le Lord Iddesleigh (rallying himself with a great effort). You
forget. Monsieur, that you are addressing yourself to a Representa-
tive of a Power that possesses a Navy
M. Waddington. Which would be useless to combat the torpedo-
fleet of France that would be let loose, like a nest of hornets, against
your vessels of commerce and Passenger Steamboat Companies. vV"ith
their cargoes and freights of saloon occupants, they would be swiftly
sent to the bottom of the sea in all directions, and the Над of France
would float triumphant alike over their protests and their struggles.

(Sapid reproduction by Our Special Artist, exhibiting most of the Principal Features, and inany novel effects. )
Believe me, Milord, all has been foreseen. A great Power does not
embark in bazardons enterprises without safeguarding her interests,
and it is'thus maritime France defies your ironclads.
Le Lord Iddeshigh (growing white with terror). It is too horrible!
It is an act monstrous, and inhuman!
AI. Waddington (with irony). Pardon, Milord, it is a precaution.
But Ifam waiting your answer.
Le, Lord Iddesleigh (mattering a profound emotion). It is with
such surprise that I receive this intelligence, that I must beg you
accord me some interval for reflection. You will permit that I con-
sult my colleagues before replying to a question at onoe so delicate
and astounding.
_ Л. Waddington (with a grave dignity). I regret that the instruc-
tions I have received byjthe electric wire do not admit of my being
able to contemplate any postponement.. I must press you, Milord,
for your reply on the instant.
Le Lord Iddesleigh (with the tears rising in his eyes). But may I
not have ten little minutes of consultation with my Chief—say, my
good friend, I may have ten little minutes?
If. Waddington. Impossible! The dignity and honour of France,
too long outraged by delays, demand the reply instantaneous. Speak,
Milord. It is a question of peace or war. Say, will the perfidious
Albion evacuate?
Le Lord Iddesleigh (overcome with grief). Ah,'my good Monsieur,
you little know what the giving of this answer costs me! ( With
a supreme effort of control). Beit so then. It will! (Sinks back-
ward into a basket of waste paper, with a sudden attack of the
vertigo as the incident terminates.)
GIVING THE CITY ITS DUES.
HIGH upon Highgate,

The old Corporation

And why did they wend there?
To give, as they should,

From Hornsey Rise,
And praised Lord Mayor STAPLES
Up to the skies.
They dined him; then hint.d,
"If you ran be so good,
We 'd like, in addition,
The Churchyard Dale Wood!"
The Mayor gave a smile.
And the Sheriffs a sigh,
And the old Corporation
A wink that was sly.
"Then give us the grain dues,"
They said, "to collect, [don
And each green space round Lon-
We'U duly protect!"
SATS the Pall Mall Gazette: "The settlement of Zululand which
Mr. STANHOPE announced to a deputation, is not so good as was in
certain quarters hoped." Quite so. In fact, the tales of Hope and
the tale of STANHOPE are quite different stories by quite different
authors.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH'S STUDIO.
IL—MES. G ORE-JENKINS. A SUBUBBAN "POLITICAL LADT."
"THE mind of a modern
Muse and the mien of a
Roman matron!"
This was the tribute paid
by the ambitiously epi-
grammatic Secretary of the
South Brixwood Constitu-
tional Association to Mrs.
GORE-JEN KDÎS.
Mrs. GOBE-JENKINS is a
power in South Briiwood,
for which new suburban
constituency her husband,
thanks mainly to her splen-
did energy and seductive
charm, is Conservative
Member. As the prefix
GORE has somewhat re-
deemed that gentleman's
own patronymic from ple-
beian and almost comic
insignificance, so the pos-
session of such a wife has
raised and rescued him
from the " ruck" of opulent
nonentities to which he
naturally belonged. Mr.
JENKINS was merely the
dapper and rather charac-
terless successor to the fortune of a very prosperous Sauce-manu-
facturer. Mr. GORE-JENKINS is "our admirable and eloquent
representative," a slashing Champion of the Great Constitutional
Cause, an adroit combination of Imperial Patriot, and Working-Man's
Friend, a President, a Patron, a Platform Perorator, and—the
husband of Mrs. GOBE-JENKINS. There are those who say that the
latter happy qualification comprehends, as it created, all the rest.
Mrs. GOBE-JENKINS is what may perhaps be called a spacious
personage. Her presence looms large and her influence is pervasive.
Her stately figure seems somehow to fill more space than even its
opulent proportions entitle it to, and as a political and social "per-
meator, she is scarcely to be surpassed. On the polling-day she really
appeared to be ubiquitous, and wherever she went she carried with
her an atmosphere of satisfaction and success. Mr. ( 11 > ик-.l кхк IN s is
trim and rather tall, but he is not impressive, and he is nervous.
His style is, or at least was, tentative, some would say timid, his
speech thin, dry, and uninspiring, his gestures are finical and
fidgety, and the way in which he rather tittivates than twirls his
neat flaxen moustache, is more suggestive of Mr. TOOTS than of the
Grand Turk, of a deferential dandy, than of a dashing If Artagnan
or even a conquering CHURCHILL. But the style of his lady is large
and suavely confident. When she stands she is statuesque, when
she moves she sweeps and flows. If it is not quite correct to say that
she towed her husband into political port, it is Because she is so much
too graceful and too noiseless to be even metaphorically regarded as
a tug.
The public is not of course admitted to the penetralia of the GOBE-
JENKINS ménage. But it is assumed with much confidence, in South
Brixwood, that Mrs. GORE-JBNKINS has been the inspirer of her
husband's political ambition, as she has been the herald of its hope,
and the assurer of its success. "She egged him on, and she pulled
him through," said Mr. LUFFS, his enthusiastic and astute amateur
Election Agent. The members of the local Constitutional Associa-
tion officially respect their President, but they personally adore their
President's wife. They are ready to move and carry any number of
jubilant, and rather redundantly worded, "Votes of Thanks," to
Mr. GORE-JENKINS. That is party business of the usual conven-
tional complexion. A world without "Votes of Thanks," is simply
inconceivable to your local politician. But to bow before Mrs. GORE-
JENKINS is a delight, to timidly touch her neatly gloved hand is a
tremulous joy, to be smiled on by her at a soirée, or garden-party, is
an ecstasy, and to shout for her is a rapture. "She is so affable."
cry the men, "she is so nice," exclaim the women. When she
complimented young TOMKINS, the Association's "RANDOLPH," on
his slashing speech in favour of Fair Trade, looking level into his
eyes yet gleaming with oratorical excitement, and touching with her
finger-tips his shoulder, almost sore with exuberant " action," he,
the fluent defender of Constitutionalism, the confident dogmatiser on
history and economics, the daring denouncer of 11 a warden and all its
works, he, even he, actually flushed and faltered, and "couldn't
find words to express" his proud emotion. It was a splendid chance
for another sounding little speechlet, or another neat little "senti-
ment," and he actually missed it. But she saw it all, and so put him
at his ease in the course of five minutes' flattery, that he '' brough
off" something creditable after all, and went home almost as oon
tented with her, as with himself. Which is saying much.
Of course Mrs. GOBE-JENKINS is the presiding divinity of the loca
branch of the Primrose League. Was it not she who induced the
lovely and flamingly patriotic Lady CELADON to honour a Southern
suburb with her radiant aristocratic presence ?" Where t'e South
Brixwood?" asked Lady CELADON, not of Mrs. GOBE-JENKINS oi
course, but of Lord C., her husband. The transpontine parts of on:
ever-spreading Babylon, are as pathless wilds and remote sucia
jungles to the dwellers in the West. But Lady CELADON went to
South Brixwood, and actually made a little speech to the palpitating
devotees of the Sacred .Primrose. How the discomfited LiberaL
mocked—and envied !" ANTI-HUMBUG," (a Brutus-like Member 01
the South Brixwood Liberal and Radical Association) penned a letter
à la JUNTOS (at least he thought so) to the South Brixwood Sentinel
fiercely denouncing " the aristocratic jockeying, the fraudulem
feminine finesse, the autocratic terrorism on one side, and the
flunkeyish sycophancy on the other, which marked the 'Primrose
Path," to political power." "ANTI-HUMBUG" concluded by urging
upon his fellow Liberals the absolute necessity of devising a "set-
off " to the Primrosers by bringing legitimate female influence anc
genuine social power to bear on their own side. He thought thai
•' The Daisy Brigade" would not be a bad title.
Party differences apparently often resolve themselves into a mere
difference of adjectives.
Meanwhile Mrs. GOBE-JENKINS smiled, and conquered while she
smiled. She conquered the smart voung sons of shopkeepers—there
were thousands of them in South Brixwood—by feminine blandish-
ments adapted to their mental measure and their social yearnings.
They, however, did not require much conquering, being already pre-
disposed to whatsoever things were "respectable," patriotic, and
didn't smell of Shop, don't you know. How much better a bow
from a beautiful dame in a carriage, than a nod from a grubbj
Radical printer " on our Committee!" She conquered numbers ol
working-men, and particularly of working-men s wives. How?
Well, that is a point much disputed. Some say she stooped tc
conquer these, stooped very much indeed, stooped in a way thai
honesty could not approve, nor Law—could it be invoked—condone.
"Blarney and Blankets, Sir. Taradiddles and Tickets for Soup,
Lady-like Lies, and Respectable Boycotting! That 's how it 's done.
Sir I" So said Mr. STOCKFISH, the caustic Stentor of the Radical
Club. It is certain that little extra creature comforts, and the beliei
that Mr. GLADSTONE was a madman, a traitor and an atheist, spread
considerably amongst the poorer voters in South Brixwood. But
whether this had anything to do with the friendly calls and earnest
counsels of Mrs. GOBE-JENKINS and her Primrose Dames, who shall
say, or rather—for that is the only practically important point—who
shall prove? Mr. STOCKFISH did not succeed, and even an Election
Petition has been known to fail in doing so. As DISRAELI said, "It
is pleasant to be 'made much of '—even by scoundrels." And of
course Mr. and Mrs. GOKE-JENKINS are not " scoundrels."
Are there then none found to "say things" against Mrs. GOBE-
JENKINS? Why, even a political Diana shall not escape calumny.
As, in the interests of her husband, she can be kind and most con-
descending, so, in the same interest, it is said that she can be un-
scrupulous and even cruel. Can one expect what Rhadamanthine
male politicians call "Corruption and Intimidation," to look quite so
black and blameworthy in the eyes of a woman and a wife r_ The
feminine "point of honour " is so different from ours! The intro-
duction of ladies into political life may bring many boons and bles-
sings to men; but will they be in the direction of a more rigorous
interpretation of the "Corrupt Practices Act"? The Diary of a
Primrose Dame, conscientiously written, might throw light on that
point. Mrs. GORE-JENKINS probably keeps no such Diary. Most
certainly she will not publish it. The wives of Radical workmen
who are not " bribed with blankets," will talk, will denounce the—
real or imaginary—tempter, will land themselves for rising superior
to the—actual or fancied—temptation. Shopkeepers who will not
promise to "vote the right way," and subsequently, if not conse-
quently, lose half their best customers, will complain. And аз
people love not to complain, as the Scotchman swcre, "at large,"
they will probably, in their anger, associate their injuries with
somebody or other. But is Mrs. GORE-JENKINS to be held responsible
for the chilblains of misguided labour's children, or the sorrows of
half-ruined and revolutionary grocers and butchers? You had better
not tell Mr. LUPUS so, or suggest such an absurdity to Orator TOMKTNS.
Is it likely that a lady so charming, so condescending, so benevolent,
and so truly British, would dream of Boycotting a poor deluded
wretch of a Radical shoemaker, even for the shameful, nay, almost
seditious, sin of—not voting for her husband?
Studying the traits, here lightly outlined, of Mrs. GORE-JENKINS,
Mr. Punch, as he turns his canvas towards the public, feels pro-
foundly impressed with the manifold advantages which must accrue
to society and the State from the presence and activity of "Political
Ladies."

PASTEE AND FASTEE.
Мт dear Editor, you may remember that when you sent
me to Paris to "sleeping car" for you, some ten days ago, I
confessed that one of my greatest compensations for the
disturbance of my domestic arrangements was the pros-
pect the trip held out to me of being able to visit MM.
MRRT.ATTI and Succi, the fasting men, and perchance
become their rivals. "Having for vears experienced a
strong wish to give up food-taking," I wrote, " I thought
if I once got to the Gay City I might take a few hints
from them anent the best mode of carrying out my
economical intention." So, although my first object was
to efficiently represent you, my second was to learn how
to preserve the graceful line of my chest. In the character
of your agent I ate and drank everything I thought you
would have liked, replying to those who murmured when
I asked for a fourth helping of filet de bœuf sauce Béar-
naise, that I knew you would have done the same had
you been there to do it.* Having thus performed my
duty to you, I called upon the fastibg men.
There were two of them. The first was Signer MER-
J.ATTI, whom I found domiciled in the most gorgeous
apartments on the first floor of the Grand Hotel. I did

cution for exceeding instructions.—ED.

not see the Starving One alone, as I accompanied one of the most accomplished
linguists of modern times, who was influenced by a motive different to my own.
As I have said, my sole desire was to learn how to do without food, his was
to accumulate material for an article no doubt to be published in some
scientific journal. We took with us a third friend, a dramatist of repute and
the proprietor of a theatre, who, I fancy, was on the look-out to see if he
could work "the fasters" either into the pathetic scenes of a sensation mélo-
drame or the after-part of a Christmas pantomime. "We all three had note-
books. We had come prepared with a card of introduction from one of the
greatest of our Paris Correspondents, and had managed on the road to lose the
talisman. However, this calamity was not attended by disaster. The waiters,
on learning that we wanted to see the Faster, immediately ushered us into his
presence. He was seated beside a table in a gorgeous saloon, with two beds
behind him, and a signboard representing (so I imagined) "The Mephistopheles
Head" in front of him. There was also a salver containing a napoleon and two
gold pieces of ten francs, not very far from him. As we understood that by
the rules of his fast he was not allowed to eat metal, we none of us could explain
the raison d'être of the money. My friend the Linguist began in fluent Italian
to ask him several questions, to which he received long answers.
"What 's he saying f " I inquired, and was told that he was giving an account
of his life up to then. "What «cos his life ?" I persisted.
"Oh, most interesting," returned my friend the Linguist, filling his note-book
with eagerness and rapidity.
At length the Faster mentioned a London address, very familiar to me, and I
was induced to ask him if " he could speak English?"
"Oh, yase," he promptly replied, and much to the surprise (and I can't help
fancying a little to the chagrin) of my friend the Linguist, M. MÍELATTI gave me
a number of very interesting particulars in Anglo-Saxon. He said that he
wished to prove that he coula live entirely upon water for an indefinite period,
and that his case was attracting the attention of the most scientific doctors.
M. MEKLATTI was immensely pleased to hear that I was Your Representative,
Sir, and gave me to understand, that he considered that the doctors would
derive immense benefit from my assistance. Encouraged by this very friendly
reception, I asked the Faster why he had the sign-board of "The Mephisto-
pheles Head," in the room with him, when he told me that it was a portrait
of himself painted by a friend. Shortly after this we took our leave with
many expressions of mutual regard. We were careful to avoid disturbing
the salver in any way, for fear that the coins therein contained, might possibly
be a part of some interesting experiment. My friend, the dramatist and
theatrical manager, oa our way to the Rue Gluck, to see M. Succi, was
silent, no doubt making up his mind whether he should introduce M. MEHLATTI
under the heading of "Dying of Thirst in the Desert," in his forthcoming
melodrama, or treat him from a strictly pantomimic point of view, and bring
his effigy out of a trick tea-pot labelled "the water cure," or "a Whine from
foreign parts."
The ménage of the second Faster was very different from that of the first.
A certain dignified melancholy had prevailed in "No. 93, Grand Hotel "—in the
Rue Gluck, all was life and activitv. We were shown into a room containing
circulars, which covered handsome chairs and sofas, and overflowed on to costly
carpets. Two gentlemen were busily employed in addressing envelopes, assisted
by a lady of commanding appearance. Walking about, smoking a large cigar,
and wearing a sort of Turkish fez, was a third gentleman, who I took, from
the venerable dignity of his appearance, to be an Italian doctor, of world-wide
reputation. The Faster was also there, looking bright and courageous. There
was an air about the room and its occupants of business-like energv that was
absolutely exhilarating. I felt ashamed of sitting idle, and, could I have
managed it, would have done something extremely active in the fasting line
myself. Again the Linguist plunged in medias res with his Italian. At first
none of the foreigners appeared to understand English, when suddenly one of
the gentlemen at the desks sprang up, and seized the Linguist by the hand, and
the dignified old person with the big cigar and the Turkish fez greeted my other
friend with equal heartiness. It appears that they were all, more or less,
acquaintances. At the moment of the rapprochement I was talking to M. Succi
in admirable French, and, after hearing from him that he (so I understood him
to say, although, I frankly admit, I may have mistaken his meaning) had taken
part in the Zulu War, which had given him the first rough idea of fasting, was
courteously expressing to him my enchantment at having met him.
"Enchanté de vous voir," I observed, with a bow, and from that
moment all was joy and contentment. We were so heartily pleased with one
another, that, I flunk if anyone had proposed it (say the lady of commanding
appearance) all of us would nave willingly taken part in a vigorous war-dance.
The rest of our visit, was spent in mutual congratulations.
When we had left, I asked my companion, "who, their friends were ?" and
learned that the acquaintance of the Linguist, was a gentleman very well-
known in Tunis, and well known to the dramatist as a theatrical agent of the
widest experience in Italy. And here were both of them united in the pleasant
bonds of scientific research! It was most gratifying!
When I got back to my hotel, and quietly thought the matter over, I
came to the conclusion a little sadly, that fasting was being so admirably done
by its two most recent exponents, that perhaps after all, there was no room
"for poor little ие."
However, I was consoled by the thought that I might gain distinction
in a feat m an opposite direction. I saw in the papers, that a champion
levourer had sprung up. Why should I not become his rival, and call myself
The Great Consumptionist? I immediately commenced trainine lor the contest
and have been eating ever since. CHABLES—YOUB FBIEKD.

ADVICE GRATIS.—MEDICAL.
By Our Own Fellow of the Royal College of
Physicians (Chattanooga).
HANTVELL.—Your mucous membrane has
obviously gone wrong, but it would not be
advisable to do what you propose, namely,
to ram a red-hot poker down your throat,
except under medical supervision.
SUFFERER.—You will find petroleum
very good substitute for best Brittany butter,
if you cannot afford the latter. Head my
book—" Dyspepsia, its Cause and Cure."
A. 8. 8.—A cold in the head is usually
symptomatic of an inflammatory condition
of the upper part of the air-passages. It
will no doubt materially assist you to get
rid of the one yon have got, and which you
say has lasted without intermission since
1848, to know that its scientific name is
"Coryza." This is as much information as
you deserve without forwarding my fee,
which I may remind you, is far less than
you would have to pay if you consulted any
respectable local medical man.
BLUE RLBBONITE.—If, as yon say, you are
five feet six inches high, and weigh eighteen
stone, it is probable that you are too stout
to be in complete health. Stop suppers. Also
stop dinner and breakfast. Lunches and
teas should also be avoided. Don't smoke,
and live solely on alcohol for a time. It
will make you thinner.
ANXIOUS.—Probably you have water on
the brain, but I cannot tell, as you do not
give enough details.
INFLUENZA.—Sleep with your window
wide open in all weathers. Carefully soak
your night-shirt in cold water before getting
into bed. You wul then probably not be
troubled much longer by your cough or
anything else. Five waistcoats are too
many. Sell four of them, and with the
proceeds (after remitting me my fee) pur-
chase a clean shirt, as two years is rather
long to go without a change of linen.

MIXED MUSIC.
LBS Cloches'de'. Cornecille is likely to prove the best card in Milo?
MAYER'S pack, with Madame SIMON MAX, M. FAVART, and M.
SIMON MAX. It was produced
last Thursday, for the ¿ret time
during the present short season,
and Mr. Punch has no hesitation
in recording that such success as
it achieved, was due entirely to
Madame SIMON MAX as Serpo-
let le, M. FAVART as Le Mar-
quis, and, longo intervalle, M.
timon MAX, who appropriately
enough played the part of that
very simple SIMON GrenicJieux.
The music and the plot have be-
come so familiar in England,
within the last ten years, that
whether the libretto be in French
or Datoh, or in the language of
the Druidio Bards, is a matter of
indifference to London playgoers.
They know the action of the piece from beginning to end, and have been
accustomed to see it so perfectly rendered, more perfectly, with one
notable exception, than it has ever been given, even at its best and
freshest, in Paris, that any .shortcomings are likely to cause con-
siderable disappointment.
Considering that Her Majesty's MAYER has been bringing out a

fresh Opera almost every night since the commencement, and that
the Old Theatre—far too large, by the way, for such Operas as Le»
Cloches, and La Grande Duchesse—is in straitened circumstances
as regards scenery and properties, and taking also into consideration
that the time for rehearsal must be necessarily very limited, the un-
defeated M. MAYER may fairly account any success a triumph.
Madame SIMON MAX, whose singing and acting present the rare
combination of French "chic" and modest grace, is inimitable in
her delicately humorous rendering of the well-known "R cardez
par ci, regardez par là," which, it is needless to say, obtained a
hearty encore, as did also her " Quand un régiment ne me fait pas
peur. When, as was remarked to Mr. Punch by an eminent
musical critic belonging to a people rightly struggling to be tree,
"Sure, Mr. Poonch, ye heard the very roll of the d-r-r-rum in her
mode of giving the letter 'r' in r-r-r-efriment. Ye may remim-
ber—-" And here the learned and experienced gentleman adduced
some instances of vocalisation which he had heard in Dublin that
would favourably comparo with anything all over the worruld, be it
where it might, which pleasant discoorse Mr. Punch does not feel
himself at liberty to reproduce in this place.
M. FAVART, as Le Marquis, left little to be desired. He was
warmly applauded, and encored in his principal songs and duetts.
M. SIMON MAX could not have touched his own maximum, and retired
in favour of his wife. M. BELLIARD'S Gaspard was not particularly
striking. The pirt of the comic Bailli was ill-dressed,pantomimioally
painted, and played in the extravagant fashion which has become
stereotyped for comió Baillis on the French stage.
If the French, as is constantly being said, are " born actors," their

UNDER WATER AND ABOVE BOARD.
WHY should not the recent alleged secret
interference of a High Official in Her Maj esty's
Navy, that has induced the Admiralty to
appoint a commission to effect some immense
saving in the pay of eichteen-penee an hour
accorded to seamen-divers, when on duty,
lead to a further inquiry with a view to
substantial and palpable economical reform?
It may have already occurred to H.R.H. the
D-ke of ED-NB-RGH,—hut if not, the
suggestion now offered may be thought
worthy of attention,—that there must be
many snug berths immediately connected
with the Board itself where a little judicious
cutting down of salary could do no harm.
Then there are the various perquisites that
fall to the lucky ones of the Service. These
offer a fine field for investigation. Then,
again, there is the pay of the Admiral him-
self in command of the Fleet, that might be
taken into active consideration. Why, for
instance, shouldhe not be mulcted, say £210i.
a day, when he goes on shore? Cannot a
considerable saving, say to the extent of a
ha' porth, be made in the amount of pitch
and tar ordinarily used? In the interests of
the country, and of sobriety, the grog might
be watered to the extent of one third. In
fact the Duke, of whom the noble city from
which he takes his title may well be proud,
does well to remember, and to act upon, the
old Scotch proverb, "Manya mickle makes
a muckle ;" only don't make too great a
muckle of it.

LEDGE'S Perfect Pocket Library Series is

nal illustrations. The Chimes, thus got
up, is a specimen of Selles Lettres.
natural talents (unless they diminish in proportion to physical growth)
ought to he remarkable even with indifferent rehearsal, and an intui-
tive knowledge of correct stage-business might he fairly expected
from them. Mr. Punch confesses he saw nothing to justify the
presumption of natural .histrionic qualifications in the subordinate
people, actors, chorus, or supers. Perhaps they were all exceptions;
only, if so, M. MAYER, the next time, had better not select so
exceptional a company, especially as a London audience will not
support an unsupported star, or even a couple of stars, however
excellent they may be. They wouldn't do it in the^case of JENNY
LIND, _ they wouldn't do it for MARIO and GRISI, and they haven't
done it for PATTI, at all events, not in so decided a manner as to
warrant an impresario in starting an Italian Opera on Madame
PATH'S own terms. Still, all this being said, here is Madame SIMON
MAX, and Mr. Punch can unhesitatingly recommend everyone who
cares for this style of opera not to lose the chance of seeing and hear-
ing this lady as Serpolette. She is the belle of the Bells of Corneville.
The Oracle has spoken. "Whisper I " said Mr. Punch's friend from
the Sister Isle, if any one of our burlesque actresses had to be cast
for the belle of the Corneville Belles, whose name would you select?"
And before Mr. Punch had time to anticipate the answer and
reprove the levity, his questioner replied, "Sure, 'twould be RNELLY
FARBEN," and disappeared round the corner.
At the Opéra Comique Оыг Diva, the mise-en-scène of Mr. RAE'S
English version of Josephine Vendue par tes Sœurs, is in many
respects better than the French original. The scenery (especially that
of the Second Act showing a view of Cairo) is infinitely superior, and
the dresses far more magnificent. But then it is only fair to say
that the stage management of Josephine at the Bouffes is weak.
The English book, by Mr. C. M. RAE, is a skilful adaptation,
which, while omitting the Scriptural parodies that would have justly
offended '.English playgoers (even if they had succeeded in escaping
the Licenser, "Our Mr. PIGOTT," which would have been .highly
improbable), preserves the spirit of the French original.
As to the company, Pans, on the whole, has the advantage of
London. True, Miss EFFIE CLEMENTS as Josephine, or rather
Caroline (as she is called over here) is far more pleasing in appear-
ance than her French counterpart; but Miss MINNIE MARSHALL, as
Fifine (Benjamine], on the other hand, is not a patch upon the
French original. The Pasha is much better played in the theatre in
the Passage than in England. If Mr. WYATT, who appears in the
character at the Opéra Comique, has not seen the Bouffes version, he
had better run over to Paris with a note-book. In the meanwhile he
might curb his tendency to indulge in "gag," especially when the
habit takes the shape of giving an unpleasant illustration of hic-
coughs. The Concierge of Madame AMADI was also inferior to the
original, and a second visitor to Paris might be added to the first.
Nowadays the journey is made so rapidly between the two capitals,
that it ought to be within the resources of civilisation to afford the
lady and gentleman referred to an opportunity of foreign study, by
giving them " their Sunday out," which would obviate removing
them even for a single night from the playbill. It would be worth the
trouble, as there is considerable room for improvement in Our Diva.
Mr. FRANK CELLI, as actor and singer, is better than the French
original, and Mr. BEAUMONT, as Abdallah, is superior to the gentleman
who filled in Paris the role of Potiphar. If Mr. BARKER, who " pro-
duced" " Our Diva," has seen Josephine, and refers to his notes, he
will find that the business might be in many places improved. For
instance, the advance of the Concierge with Caroline and Fifine, fol-
lowed subsequently by the rest of her daughters in thefinale of the
Second Act, is quite spoilt (it is a great effect in Paris) by the feeble-
hearted manner in which it is undertaken over here. The principals
should stride right across the stage, and then stop—the same business
being repeated by the chorus. The idea is the advance of infantry
supported by the reserve, and when properly done, is decidedly funny;
and if the business " is improved on the stage, business in front of
the house will improve also. At present Mr. Punch is glad to report
that the Diva appears to be doing as well as can be expected.
Mr. Punch compliments Miss FANNY DATEES (of the Principality,
he supposes) on her charming rendering of two short pieces by
SCHUMANN at the Monday Pops, of the 8th instant.
Sir 'ARTHUR'S Golden Legend will, ere this appears, have been
heard at the Albert Hall. Mr. Punch reserves his golden opinion
for its performance at the St. James's on the 23rd, Consule NOVELLO.
A LEOAL DIFFICULTY.—Vice-Chancellor BACON has retired at the
early age of ninety. He objected to hirsute barristers, and rightly
refused to be bearded in his own Court. So witty and mercilessly
caustic was he as a Judge, that every Junior was anxious to get on
the right side of BACON. His loss is great, but not irreparable. Among
all the wit and talent of the English Bench and Bar, is there no one
to take the place of BACON? Oh, Gammon!

ROBERT'S RECKERLEKSHUNS.
No. Ш.

WEN I was jest in the werry prime and wigour of my manhood I
used to get a good deal of werry good work down at Grinnidge. It
was a much more f ashonabler place than it is now, as all the young
West End swells used to drive down ocashunaUy with their fare
cumpanion» and have such dinners as we seldom sees now excep at
the Manshun Ouse, or the Livery Companies Alls. We used to think
nothink of 16 Courses. I 've heard my Father say that sum of the
Stock Exchange gents used to cum down sumtimes, and they used to
go it pretty freely, and thort no reelly good dinner could be had
under 3 Ginnys a bed, and the great QUARTERMANES, and setterer, of
them days, used to encurrage the nobel idear. I remembers his
telling us that there was one Gent among 'em who had wunce been
told as he werry much ressembled his most relidgeous Majesty GEORGE
the 4th, so he always drest hisself like him, and one day when he
came to dine with 'em at Grinnidge, being rayther late, when he
hentered the reeepshun Room, they all formed a double line, and
struck up as loud as they ooud holler, " God Save the King!" and
them as coudn't sing pertended to play it on warious hinstruments,
and wen he got to the werry hend of the room, he turned hisself
round and sed, "Bless yer, my peepel!" Ah, they is a jolly lot, is
them Stock Exchange Gents, and werry gineroua to us, as all trew
Gents natrally is.
I remembers tho' that one of the werry britest on 'em rayther
puzzled me the other day. It was a 3 ginny dinner, witch is rayther
a rare thing in these regenerate days, and he said to me, says he,
"ROBERT," says he, "what difference is there between a 3 ginny
dinner and a 30s. one?" Well, for a moment I was amost thrown

sarce, and reel Lobster with your Tubbot, and how offen do you git
them I wundere?" "Ah, well," says he, "there's sumthink in
that, so I "11 allow harf a crown for 'em. Now, what else is there '<"
I was amost stumped, wen a brite thort struck me, and I says, says
I, "If you '11 be kind enuff to notice, Sir, you '11 see as all us Waiters
has new wite kid gloves on, and I don't spose as yon ewer gets that
for your 30«. dinner." And with that I leaves him and gos to
another part of the table, and I acshally seed him a telling of the
story to his naybor, and a pinting at me, and both of 'em a larfing
like two kangaroos.
A speaking of Grinnidge, as I did jist now, reminds me of my
greens and sallad days, when I went a courting of the future
Mrs. R. Grinnidge ain't at all a bad place for courting. You can
meet your Beloved in the Park, and arter a little wark you can take
a seat, and look at the ships a going backards and forreas with their

noboddy a cumming, you can take on yer At, coz of the heat, as
you says, and then you can take yer darlin's and with no glove on

downcast '-yes, yon say, "Deer LOOWEESER! shall we jine our
fortunes together like them ere two ships as is a going along so nice
and emu feral P Yon shall be the bootiful sailing wessell, so lovely
and so fare, and I will be the useful steamer as shall tug yon safe
into the Arbour of appyness." Then you gives her and a squeege,
and then she says, Yes, ROBERT, dear, we will." And then you
gives her a kiss, and it 's all over, and you warks her off in
triumph to the nearest Restorong, and gives her a nice little dinner.
Ah! Mrs. ROBERT was a reel lovely creeohur in them appy days;
and ewen now, tho' of course time, and Babbys, and suckemstancee
alters cases and alters forms, she 's still a remarkabel fine woman,
and I 've never had not no cause to regret my bold hact on that there
lovely summer evening in beantifool Grinnidge Park.
I shood strongly recommend all my yung readers to marry nice,
pretty-looking wives—they lites up the nouse like a sunbeam all the
mornin, and are as good as a good lire, and a SUGG'S gas-light of a
heavenmg. And as for them as is nnfortnet enuff to be plane, why,
when they quite tires of Sunday skools, and Dorcus meetings, and
MOODT'S novels, there 's all the Collonys a reddy to reeseve em with
hopen harms. Sum of my frends at flic Collinderies told me as how
as the werry planest need not dispare so long as they was good-
tempered and cheerful. Why in sum places I was told as all the
Bacheldores of the place cums off to the ship in Botes, afore she was
ankered, and jest takes a look round, and makes their choice, and
the matter's all settled in about ten minuets; and if too or three on
'em chooses the same one, there ain't no quarrellin about it, but they
gos hod man who shall have her.
Sum of them Collonys must ha' bin rayther rum places to live in a
good many years ago. I remember a yung frend of mine going to
Wan Demons Land, when I was quite a lad. He cum back ш about
5 years, and I never could find out who paid his passage, either out
or ome. There was allers a little mistery atached to it, so I didn't
enquire no f urder. But he told me as all the servants, waiters and
all, was transported theeves, and all the reel natives used to wark
about Obart Town as naked as oysters! But like every think else in
this mortial world, you soon got used to it, and thort nothink of
neether of them singular suckemstancee, and he had the imperance
to say that he had bin told as the Marsters and Missuses didn't find
werry much diffrence as regards their Onsekeeping xpenses.

"FRUGES CONSUMERE NATI."
[A Vegetarian Restaurant has been opened in the Strand opposite the
Boyal Courte of Justice.]
I HAVE always loved a vegetable dinner, I delight
In the Crecy saup or Conde on the menu of the night;
The potato needs no praises, there is rapture too I ween
On the face of every gourmet at the mention of the bean:
And, like wise Sir HENRY THOMPSON, I can feel mjr heart aglow
At the thought of all the merits of the pleasant haricot.
I am very fond of cabbage, and the tender spinach begs,
Though it isn't quite en règle, to be served up with poached eggs;
Then the cauliflower is charming, and the celery when viewed
Fresh and crisp from out the garden, or artistically stewed.
While surely on one esculent we 're all unanimous,
Is there aught that 's more entrancing than thy taste—asparagus!
All must love the lively lettuce; we have reason too to bless
Cruc\fer<f for sending us the piquant water-cress;
Upon any list of salads let the true tomato stand,
With the endive and the beet-root as supporters on each hand;
There the cucumber awaite us, and we fain would keep alive
Both the tarragon and chervil and insinuating chive.
There is poetry in mushrooms, and the lentil too can please,
And a thrill goes through my midriff at the thought of early peas;
I am grateful to the turnip and the parsnip looking pale:
There 's the salsify seductive and the delicate sea-kale;
But the bard shrinks back from one task, for no mortal ever can
Do full justice to the comfort that the onion is to man!
Then we '11 hasten to the Griffin, for a little way beyond
Are the Vegetarian dining-rooms of Messrs. SPIERS AND POND;
And the Doctors too are with us, men of note in London town,
RISDON BENNET, MILNEB FOTHEHGIIX, and also CRICHTON-BROWNE;
They have told us very plainly that of health we should he winners,
If we ate less meat, indulging in more vegetable dinners.

SOCIALISM IN THREE VOLUMES.
Ir the Socialists had to sing small on Lord Mayor's Show day, they
may perhaps find consolation in other quarters. Flouted by Society,
abused by the Press, and checkmated by Sir CHABLES WABBEN, they
have at least found favour with the Novelist. They seem, indeed,
lately to have taken all fiction for their province.
One would hardly, however, have expected the dainty and deli-
berate HENRY JAMES to take anything so violent, so vulgar, so
destitute of "sweet reasonableness" as Socialism for his subject.
Yet here we find him in his new novel, The Princess Casamassima,
dealing with Secret Societies, and the Great Restitution. Dealing
in his own way, of course, which is, perhaps, hardly the firm and
full-blooded way best suited to the theme. Mr. JAMES'S specimens
of the British proletariat, like his capriciously cosmopolitan Prin-
cesses, are very select, and, as the Darwinite would say, "highly
specialised" specimens. Hyacinth Robinson and Paul Muniment
are very far indeed from being average British Workmen, and they
and their j story, it must be feared, would pretty considerably
puzzle any handicraft member of the Social Democratic Federation
who took up The Princess Casamassima with the idea of getting any
light upon Culture's view of " the movement."
To the ordinary and not too earnest reader, however, Mr. JAMES'S
new book is very delightful reading. Poor ill-fated Hyacinth, with
his tragic antecedents, his mixed nature, his artistic instincts and
conflicting sympathies, his small person and his great, if delicate
and undemonstrative pluck, and his dismal doom, is a very winning
character. Paul Muniment is a puzzle and a disappointment.
Pinnie, the frail and confused but devoted little dressmaker, is
delightful. 'Sfillicent is a somewhat Dickensian character, but
touched in very cleverly, with somewhat finical irony in place of some-
what exaggerated humour. She is very real, and seems more vivid
and vascular than any other character in the book. As to the miracu-
lously lovely, man-tormenting, convention-defying, emotion-seeking
Princess Casamassima herself, with her sphinx-like fascinations
and her equivocal interest in "uprisings and liberations," one finds
her, in the long run, rather irritating, and just a little preposterous.
Mr. JAMES as usual, runs away from his subject, leaves most of his
heroes and heroines in the

THE BURGLARIAN QUESTION.
Mr. Punch, loquitur:—
BRAVO, Sir CHARLES! You've paid your footing fairly!
A better-managed job is seldom seen.
The rioters and roughs were nonplussed rarely;
Shop-smashers must have swelled with savage spleen.
Whatever fierce denouncers of the muzzle
May think about your dog-laws, they must own
That the patrons of disorder yon can puzzle,
And pnck Sedition's bubble overblown.
The Citizens of London will remember
That the scare established earlier in the year
Was allayed by you the ninth of this November,
And safety is to civic buffers dear.
Their bolts and bars, and barricades of planking
Betrayed a spirit very ill at ease;
But now your blue battalions they are thanking,
And the news that they 're rewarded well would please.
A Policeman's life, as clever GILBERT hinteth,
Is not a dream of undiluted joy;
Ask the heavy-booted Constable who sprmteth
In chase of burglar armed or nimble ooy.
A bit of special duty done so steadily
Deserves a little more than verbal thanks,
And the Public will, I 'm sure, respond right readily,
If called on to reward your truncheoned ranks.
Mr. Punch can praise, but does not care to flatter.
Nought 's done whilst there is aught remains to do,
And, Sir CHARLES, there it another little matter
That should be kept most carefully in view.
The dogs, Sir, and the democratic howlers
You certainly have tackled well, but say,
Must we really trust our special Trays and Towlers
To keep the brutal Burglar well at bay P
His season, dear Sir CHARLES, is now beginning,
And I 'm sure you '11 add a very special fame
To the kudos you've deservedly been winning
If you manage to upset his little game.
Our suburban streets and squares require attention
As much, Sir, as Cheapside or Charing Cross,
And we trust to your judicious intervention
To minimise our danger and our loss.
Too sparsely scattered Bobbies but invite him,
BILL BIKES, to dodge their bull's-eyes and their beats.
If you can circumvent the brute, and smite him,
You '11 compass the most popular of feats.
Smart Constables in just sumcient number,
Judiciously disposed and well in touch,
Would give us peace and safety whilst we slumber,
For Mr. WILLIAM SIKES would prove too much.
Verb. sap. The Public simply asks protection
In quiet home as well as bustling mart.
That being had, it will have no objection
To paying a fair price,—that is its part.
Your rule so far, Sir CHARLES, has not been barren,
But, as yon say. there 's more remains to do.
Just baffle the Bold Burglar, my dear WAHRES,
And Punch will hand a People's praise to you.
IN the Times of the 2nd inst. appeared the following :—

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A SKETCH FROM THE MIDLANDS.
, OLD CUAP! NOT HURT, I HOPE!" "Он, NO, NO! JUST GOT OFÍ то HAVB A LOOK AT THE VIEW!"
"OLD TIMES REVIVED!"
MR. PUWCH thanks Mr. RICHAKD BENTLEY AND SON, publishers in
ordinary to Her Majesty the QUEEN, for their first contribution to
the Royal Jubilee Year, represented by the republioation of ALBERT
SMITH'S Adventures of Mr. Ledbury, in one large volume, with
LEECH'S illustrations. Mr. Punch is sure that НЕЕ GRACIOUS
MAJESTY will be delighted with this faithful and most amusing
picture of life and manners, fast and "genteel," within certain
middle-class limits, fifty years ago, in London and Paris, when
elderly ladies wore awe-inspiring turbans, when young ladies came
out in ringlets and bands, when young gentlemen affected satin
stocks, and turned their wrist-bands over their sleeves, "as if they
had just washed their hands when too late for dinner, and in the
hurry had forgotten to turn the cuffs down."
ALBEKT SMITH'S style and method are distinctly traceable to the
influence of DICKENS'8 earlier works, such as the Sketches by Boz
ind Pickwick; but in the delineation of certain types, with which
he was evidently familiar, he exhibited a vein of humour, which,
though occasionally extravagant, was original and mirth-provoking;.
Such are his Mr. Ledbury, Jack Johnson, Prodgers, Rawkins, and
the boy Bob who had been brought up on proverbs.
ALBERT SMITH revelled in descriptions of theatrical life " behind
the scenes," in sketches of second-rate "professionals" of all sorts,
who dub themselves "artistes ; " and the doings of small suburban
families must have amused the author as much to narrate as they
did his admirers to read. His style in telling these "small-beer
chronicles " recalls to Mr. Punch's memory JOHN PABKT'S Entertain-
ments, to which ALBERT SMITH used largely to contribute, and on which
Mr. CORNET GRAIN, Mr. GEORGE GROSSMITH, and indeed all sub-
sequent popular entertainers, have modelled their "social sketches."
Mr. Punch is curious to learn what judgment will be passed by
;he Masher, the present fast young man, and the modern medical
student on the doings of Jack Johnson, Rawkins. Prodgers, Tweak.
ind their friends, who were the "gents," medical students, and
:'ast fellows of half a century ago. For the melodramatic part of
;he story no one will nowadays care ¡ and even when "this old
"ink was new" the transpontine theatrical element was its weakest
mrt, so much so that Mr. Punch, with whom Mr. Ledbury was a
avuunto, had forgotten these sensational scenes, while the fan of the
comic characters was fresh as ever in his memory, which preserves
all that is worth preserving in its stores, "to be left till called for."
In Mr. Punch's opinion, both early and matured, Jack Johnson
was always an insufferable cad, quite deserving the epithets bestowed
on him by the author's typically good young; lady, Miss Ledbury,
who called him to his face " ill-bred and mischievous." Would not
Jack Johnson be cut nowadays by even the rowdiest of Stock
Exchange young men, and be voted a cad by every clubbable man
above the class of 'ARRY? For in this quality of "clubbable," and
the value put now upon it, lies the whole secret of the change in our
fast men, mashers, and men about town. The "Jack Johnson" of
ALBERT SMITH'S day would be pilled even in the freest and easiest of
our social Clubs. Before the Early Closing Act, the fast young man
and the man-about-town dined in the neighbourhood of the Hay-
market, and all their amusements from six o'clock in the evening till
the same time next morning, finishing with temporary accommodation
at the station-house, were provided for them within a one-mile radius
of Leicester ¡Square. Coal-holes, cribs, casinos, and "finishes " have
all vanished with the gent, John Johnson, and Mr. Rawkins.
This new edition of The Adventures of Mr. Ledbury, coming out
in the fiftieth year of HER MAJESTY'S happy reign, will afford much
amusement, and will be read with considerable interest.
1 - - -- . — - - - *
MR. PUNCH congratulates The Lazy Minstrel on the success of his
recent publication. The first edition of his "Lays" (brought out by
Mr. FISHES, UNWIND went off with a bang that must nave astonished
His Laziness. Not having heard of, or from, the bard for some time,
Mr. Punch hopes His Laziness has quite recovered from the shock,
and that His Laziness is doing nothing with his usual ability.
THE late FREDERICK ABCHEB is called by the Special Correspondent
of the Dublin Sport, "the Star Horseman." Poor fellow! A Star,
indeed !—a shooting star, meteoric, a flash, and—gone! He died
worth over a hundred thousand pounds, and was the acknowledged
worthy representative of professional jockeydom. He leaves near
relatives to mourn his loss; and so it will be remembered of him that
he was never in any sense the last of his race. Lord BARRINGTON died
the same week. One newspaper column was raised to his memory,
contrasting with the hundred columns recording the fame of ARCHER.

LE Crocodile, the forthcoming piece

ters, its wrecks, and other situations,
sounds like a mixture of The Over-

Sea of Ice. We shall see: at least
we hope to do so.
TO AN UNEASY HEAD.
THE following telegrams were received at Cannes by Prince
WALDEMAR on Friday last. As they may serve to throw some light
on the attitude assumed by His Royal Highness towards the members
of the deputation who were to have been dispatched to him with the
offer of the Bulgarian crown, they will be read with interest :—
From the King of Denmark, Copenhagen.
WELL, my dear boy, I suppose we must congratulate ourselves.
Nevertheless, we must not act in a hurry. Remember, in the first
place, that yon do not speak the language, and that it will take you
at least six months, even with an Ollendorfl, to master its rudiments.
Then, of course, we must wait to hear what they have to say to it at
St. Petersburg. I suppose you do not know anything about the pay
or the perquisites? I near there is a Palace very decently furnished.
Yet, on the whole, we must move cautiously. We must think it
well over. Fancy we shall have to say " No."
From the Czar, St. Petersburg.
No. You '11 not take it. At least—not from the Sobranje. If I
choose to give it you,—that is quite another thing. Can't say yet
whatlshall do, but I'11 stand no nonsense. Remember, the man Iput
in, will have to keep his eyes open and wait for orders. None of the
insolent BATTENBEEG'S tricks again. However, you understand. I
don't threaten for nothing. So, for the present, hold yourself at your
Father's disposal. But I have another fellow in my eye.
From Prince Bismarck, Varzin.
WHAT should you do, my young friend, in your present predica-
ment? Well, there is no occasion to study the language, for if you
accept the offer, the less you understand what the Sobranje has to
say to you, the better will you discharge the duties of your exalted
position. For the rest, it would be as well to hear what the Herr
Brother-in-Law at St. Petersburg has to say on the matter. Let the
Herr Papa decide. Meantime I would be measured for several Rus-
sian uniforms. They are ornamental, and, in your new role, you
might probably find them useful. My best wishes to yon.
From Lord Salisbury, London.
THOUGH I would have preferred the recall of Prince ALEXANDER,
still, if you are willing to undertake the responsibilities of the situa-
tion, and determined, as a constitutional Prince, to safeguard the
Liberties of .the Bulgarian people by opposing tooth and nail the
machinations of Russian aggression and intrigue, then I counsel
your acceptance of the crown. And I flatter myself that the conster-
nation produced at St. Petersburg by my spirited declaration, made
the other evening at the Guildhall Banquet, will have rendered
the course I indicate to you an easy one to follow. Once at Sofia,
you will of course take your cue from Constantinople, where Sir
WILLIAM WHITE will be empowered to afford you all necessary
assistance. He will no doubt be easily accessible with the aid of an
intervening Pasha or two. But how about your Father?
From Prince Alexander of Battenberg, Darmstadt.
IF you '11 be guided by me, you '11 let it alone. Anyhow, here 's a
bit of advice for yon. Take care you have double patent locks to
your bedroom doors, and don't go to sleep without a loaded revolver
in each hand. Also keep a portmanteau ready packed, in case of
night surprises, for you 'П find it so inconvenient to start at 2 A.M.,
for you don't know where, without anything prepared. Experto
crede. Take my advice, and drop it.
From Genera! Boulanger, Paris.
You have not asked my opinion, but I nevertheless give it to yon
You will not accept the Bulgarian crown. Related, through Madame
the Princess, your wife, to a family not only reprobated by the whole
of France, but hostile to me personally, you are not in a position to
be acceptable to those who are at the present moment guiding the
destinies of the great and glorious Republic. I do not mean this as
a reprimand. I give it as a hint. But it is one that I am convinced

DRUIDS AT HOME.

"THE Gor-
stdd of the
Bards of the
Isle of Bri-
tain," held
the other
afternoon, in
the Temple Gardens on the Thames Embankment, appears, not-
withstanding some drawbacks, to have been on the whole a remark-
ably spirited and entertaining affair. The proceedings carried on
in a circle of "twelve unhewn stones, placed a few feet apart,"
were attended by a throng of Bards whose very name lent instan-
taneously a Druidical character to the undertaking, for to an
outsider the announcement that such worthies as CLWYDFARDD,
TELYNOH CTMBN, HWFA MON, BEEW, CEIHIOG, WYB o "WYBFAI,
LLYFBBRYF. and a heap of confreres, all endowed with other equally
sonorous titles, were assembled on the ground, must at once have been
aconvincing proof that the "Gorsedd " at least meant business. Spite
the powerful array of names, however, only the harpist seems to have
appeared in the Druidical costume, which as the proceedings had, owing
to the rain, to be conducted under open umbrellas, was just as well.
Still'the Arch Druid, a venerable gentleman of 80 years of age, was
equal to the occasion, for mounting the central stone, and "holding
out crosswise, two gold-hilted swords, on which all the Bards placed
their hands," he asked in a loud voice, "A oes Heddweh?" (Is it
peace ? ) a question apparently suggested by the attitude of some of
the spectators, who, though generally respectful in their attitude,
seemed rather inclined fora little chaff. The Bards, however, having
good-humouredly replied in the affirmative, the Arch-Druid declared
the " Gorsedd" open, and read a proclamation in Welsh, to the effect
that in the New "i ear at the Albert Hall, "in the chief city of Lud,"
an Eisteddfod would be held, "whereunto all who seek privilege and
licence in the arts of Poesy and Song, shall have right of access,"
and "that no weapon," a highly important consideration, "shall be
unsheathed against them."
This encouraging announcement, which appears to have given
much satisfaction to those present, was followed by successive recita-
tions of the assembled Bards of their compositions in the Welsh
tongue, a proceeding which the ninth Bard, who apparently thought
the outsiders had had enough of it, expressed, very amiably, nie
intention of varymg, for the benefit of those present, by reading hig
own composition in English. His announcement was, however, met
with such deafening shouts of "Dim Sassenach !" and " Cymraeg!"
that he had to abandon his original intention, and stick to Welsh.
The last of the Bards to mount the stone was the HWFA MON, who,
referring to the banks of the "Taffwys," the report says, "was
rudelv interrupted by some of the audience who did not understand
the Welsh tongue." The proceedings shortly after this came to a
conclusion, the Arch Druid, probably resenting the recent interrup-
tion, again making the earnest inquiry of the Bards, "A oes Hedd-
weh?" (Is it peace ?) To this they, very sensibly ignoring the little
disagreeable contretemps, replied, Heddweh '" (It is peace !) And
with this thoroughly satisfactory announcement the afternoon's
business came to a close.
AN INTERNATIONAL EPISODE.
(JVbi by Henry James, Junior.)
THE Public Orator at Cambridge has written an address of con-
gratulation in Latin, to Harvard University, on the 250th anniver-
sary of the latter's foundation. At a wine-party recently held at
Trinity College it was unanimously and hilariously decided that the
Undergraduates of England ought to eend greeting to the Under-
graduates of America at the same time. The following address was
at once drawn up :—
CABISSIMI JOHNNIES TRANSATLANTIC!,—Audimus vos yivere in
altero Cambridgio Americano, quod nos vapulat ut specialiter rum-
mum. Sentimus tarnen obligati mittere ad vos fraternas congra-
tulationes in hac auspiciosa occasione anniversarii vestri. Non
novimus antea aliquam) rem in America esse tarn antiquam quam
duo centum anni, sed vos cognosoitís optime circum id.
Orator Publions noster concoxit nul I urn flnem floridso orationis ad

[NOVEMBER 20, 1886.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH'S STUDIO.
STUDY No. III.-BUTLERS.
ROUGHLY speaking, the
worst butlers nave the best
manners. The Model But-
ler's are of course irre-
proachable. He is of
serious mien, and may be
overheard to hum hymns
in the pantry. He be-
longs to the Church of
England, and playe a little
upon the German concer-
tina. His chief ailments
are a weak digestion and
an active conscience; the
former of which renders
him temporarily unfit for
any exertion, while the
latter impels him to re-
gard the destruction of a
kitchen tea-cup as a crime
only to be expunged by
confession and self-abase-
ment. Fortunately, he
damages nothing of value,
and should you observe
that your glass and china
have been passing through
curious transitions and
developments, or even re-
verting to simpler forms, he explains that these Darwinian
peculiarities should be assigned to an earlier period. With almost
morbid honesty, he allows the last glass of Marsala to fur its decanter
for a fortnight, while he more than shares your pained surprise
at the rapid diminution in the number of pints of dry champagne.
Reluctantly does he denounce the page-boy, who it seems has been
habitually making himself sick with purloined cigars, and when he
is constrained to express disapproval of the lightmindedness of the
under-housemaid, it is easy to discern the struggle between a sense
of duty and still lingering partiality.
While he remains with you, the local Post-Office is even more
arbitrary than usual in restricting the transmission and delivery of
your letters.
The Model Butler's relations are all in comfortable circumstances,
but fragile health; they indulge immoderately in funerals, from
attending which functions he returns at advanced hours, in a state
of utter prostration.
Six weeks are sufficient to constitute him an old and attached
family-servant, entitled to take a respectful interest in the welfare
of his employers, and an occasional liberty.
His relations in the Country send him up at intervals small articles
of dairy produce, of which he gracefully begs your acceptance, and
which do not strike you as greatly superior to, or even dissimilar
from, those supplied by your London tradesman.
The Model Butler's anal outbreak, resembles a volcanic eruption,
in that it is frequently preceded by subterranean disturbances and
"warnings " from various quarters.
His voice, divested of all silkiness, is heard addressing fellow-
servants in terms of strong condemnation; he carries his polemics
upstairs with the coal-scuttles; he developes an alarming tendency
to involved explanation, and selects unseasonable hours for perform-
ing those duties from which he does not excuse himself.
At last, one afternoon—most probably while you have visitors—he
will bounce into the room, and, sitting down on the carpet, hiccough
his irrevocable resolution to quit a house in which the cook officiates
in a state of chronic inebriation.
Whereupon, far from there being any attempt to dissuade the
Model Butler from his intention, he will generally be rendered every
assistance in carrying it out with the least possible delay.
After his departure, he will write requesting you to testify to his
honesty, industry, and sobriety.
Perhaps, after all, the Model Butler is a pleasanter person to have
to deal with, than one of the austere type.
Your Austere Butler wears an air of disapproving on principle of
surroundings that are in bitter contrast to a nobler state m which he
had two men under him, and was not expected to wait in livery.
Attendance at your table appears to cause him much the same
agony as ANBERSEN'S Mermaid felt when she danced—though his
movements are less graceful. Should the conversation of your family
strike him as exceeding tho limits of becoming mirth, he may be
heard to murmur, "Oh, quietood—quietood !" in accents of unutter-
able yearning.
He opens the front-door with the manner of a man who feels he is
making a concession, and he hands you your umbrella in the morning
with an obvious conviction that you will employ it for some un-
worthy purpose.
At the end of a month his endurance comes to an end, and he
discharges you, when you may next obtain the services of Mr.
Punch's next study—the Oratorical Butler. He is well-meaning,
but he wffl regard most events as requiring to be rounded oft by a
neat speech. At dinner he is very happy in his apologies for the un-
avoidable absence of a fish-slice, and brings in a dish as if he were
introducing a deputation. He defends himself and the cook from a
charge of unpunctuality with a combination of dignity and pathos.
He surprises you by the masterly command of detail with which he
exposes the scandalous condition ш which his predecessor has left
the pantry, the eloquence with which he warns yon of the urgent
necessity for a new crumb-brush, and the real debating skill
displayea in his advocacy of some patent plate-powder.
If you are a good listener, he may stay with you some time, but
upon the whole, Mr. Punch thinks that an ordinary householder will
prefer the Cheerful Butler.
The Cheerful Butler admits you with a beaming welcome, and if
any duty is disagreeable to him, he does not draw attention to the
fact by going about it like a Saint SEBASTIAN. He takes a discreet
interest in your table-talk, and is not too proud to pay it the com-
pliment of a respectful smile occasionally.
Gradually you come to regard him as a personal friend, yon have
no secrets from him, and he discharges all commissions with tact and
accuracy.
Nothing comes amiss to him; in the country he teaches your boys
cricket, and bowls them out with deferential daisy-cutters.
You leave everything to him, you boast of his merits as if they
were your own manufacture; you are flattered by being congratulated
upon the possession of him. And then comes the awakening.
What? does he, too, turn out a disappointment? Ah, yes—and
perhaps the keenest of all. After years of loyal exemplary service,
he reveals himself in his true colours as the selfish egotist ne is—he
marries your cook, and the ungrateful pair devote their energies to
letting chambers, which a just and proper resentment forbids you
to recommend.
STUDY No. IV.—THE OCCASIONAL THEATRE-GOER.
THE Occasional Theatre-goer is usually to be found in the dress
circle, where he takes his seat at least twenty minutes before the
time at which the curtain is advertised to rise. This he does either
from pure perversity, or with some idea of bracing his mind for the
intellectual strain to which it will be presently exposed.
Having selected his theatre at hazard, he is invariably surprised
by the nature of the entertainment he finds there. He will go to
the St. James's prepared for burlesque or comic opera; expects to
laugh himself sore at the Lyceum, and to see Mr. IRVING or Mr.
WILSON BARRETT at the Gaiety in "something of SHAKSPEARE'S."
Consequently, as soon as he discovers his error (which is not, as a
rule, until after the First Act), he is apt to feel defrauded and
resentful.
The comprehension of the plot is a task with which he grapples
manfully, though he much prefers to have the storv explained to him
as it proceeds. Even then, he never quite succeeds in mastering its
intricacies, and spends the entr'acte in diligent perusal of the pro-
gramme, for the study of which he fortifies himself with a Neapolitan
ice. He finds insuperable difficulty in identifying the several cha-
racters of the drama, and has a tendency to go away after the Second
Act, in the full persuasion that it is all over, or else to remain seated
till the house is almost empty, in patient expectation of seeing more.
He confesses, as he goes out, that ne "didn't quite follow all of it."
The female variety of Occasional Theatre-goer always looks for-
ward to having a good cry, and is extremely indignant at being
betrayed into a smile. A piece which has had the honour of provoking
her to actual laughter sne designates as "silly": if it amuses her
husband more than herself, she condemns it as " vulgar."
The Occasional Theatre-goer suffers severely from reaction on the
following day.
The Pity of It.
WHEN GOSSE reproves COLLINS, and COLLINS chides GOSSE,
The world might ignore the small squall without loss;
But when Poet SWINBURNE steps into the fray,
And slangs like a fishwife, what, what can one say P
When Genius has found the Elixir of Life,
The Immortal should soar above Billingsgate strife.
Why, why should it force us with sorrow to own

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON СНАШУАЫ.
A MADE MUSICIAN.
(Communicated by a Mesmerised Composer. )
"Mueicus fit, non nascitur."

SUCCESSFUL? Rather! I should 'say I was!
I had to struggle hard'at first, because,
To gain a reputation, I allow
One must eat dirt. But there! I 'те done it now.
I 'm not a foreigner—I pass as one
In England—but that's more than half the fun;
Hoxton 's my birthplace, and 'tis my belief
My father did a trade in ham and beef.
Of that 1 can't be sure; for while quite young
I got kicked out of home for too much "tongue." *
And, after wandering in hopeless plight,
I found at last a friend who set me right.
A kindly lady! Would that she, now dead,
Could see the laurels that adorn my head!
She took me in and taught me all I know,
Trained me herself in playing musió, so
To her I owe my tender, tearful touch.
She gave me what she had. It was not much.
Together o'er the Continent we hied,
I lived on her, and sorrowed when she died.
She loved me. But, though she had no relations,
Her will scarce realised my expectations:
I 'd grown to man's estate; alas! her own
All went to "Charities." If I had known
Her game beforehand, I 'd have broached the topic
Of '' Self." Why will folks be so philanthropic?
Something I had to do. Italian, French,
Spanish and German, not on scholar's bench
Learned as in England, but to speak I knew.
And I could warble, though my notes were few.
"I '11 be a Great Musician! " I exclaimed.
1 ' A Cosmopolitan! Composer 1 Famed!
England 's my home! Too long my light 's been hid.
I '11 do a thundering business there!" I did—
Eventually. But ah, the tedious toil,
The weary weeks I passed ere I struck oil!
And, oh, what rapture when I got a letter
(After my landing, quite a month, or better)
From Lady VERÉ, to sav—" I heard yon sing
At Signer TWANKI'S. Will you kindly bring
Some music, and allow my friends to hear
Your charming voice? Yours truly, V. DE VEBJS."
That note I treasure in my album yet.
Ladies, dear Ladies! yes; I am your pet!
Thus was the first stone of my fortune
laid: [afraid

Oh, it was rich! I rolled my goose-

And now, my place assured, I pile up

and sold.
For, as you know, I work like any-
thing, [sing.
And I ''compose" the music that I
Of course I 'm ignorant of " harmony,"

But none the less exultingly I go on

And on the piano fumble out the tune.

FIVE O'CLOCK FEIVOL.
(By a Eeal Lady.)
DEAREST MADGE,—Such a funny thing happened to my last letter. It was
sent to the manager of the oldest evening paper by mistake, instead of to you.
I have been blushing crimson every time I have driven down the Strand since.
Furs will be very much worn this winter. This will be good news indeed to
many ladies of position, whose furs are very much worn already • for, as you
know, ma chère, if there is one thing more dear to a mondaine s heart than
another, it is to be in the forefront of the mode without being obliged to pay for
the privilege. CECIL, who is such a tease, says I ought to nave written the
fur-front of the mode." What do you think?
Papa and the boys have been having very good sport lately, and we girls
have tried our culinary skill upon the trophies of the chase. Hens, riddled with
shot, are very nice indeed, treated as pheasant, and JOHNNIE'S white rabbits
made a really succulent dish. The poor hoy, who is no sportsman, made a great
fuss about his pets, and CECIL had to give him five shillings for the sake of
peace. But, as Papa says, if they have to pay so much for their shooting at
home, they might as well have rented some, m spite of this tiresome depression
in trade. We girls have done wonders with the fowls and rabbits, but we wouldn't
allow them to make game of Puss,—I mean the Pretty, or Domestic Puss, dear;
Felis Sattsaainea, GUT calls it— even though she is, theysay, a dreadful poacher.
CECIL asked us "if we could dress Hare!"' Of course we said "Yes;" and
he produced what he calls NELLIE'S "à la rousse." She was so angry; but
evervbody knew where ehe got that beautiful " wealth of auburn," and how she
couldn't pay for it when the bill came in.
The event of the week down here has been the DE LAGT UNDERWEARS' Ball.
Some of the dresses were very novel and pleasing. Mrs. FRILTJE TUCKER,
who, entre nous, is to be the beauty next season, wore a magnificent costume
of shot plush—what the French modistes call Jacques poivrée. The colour was
a delicate shade of burnt gunpowder, and the shot, as well as I could judge,
about number six. Lady VESTA LAMBSWOOL excited much admiration in a
wonderful fluffy, fleecy gown cut à ¡a Bopeep, a fashion which is likely to be
all the rage this winter. It has no waist to speak of, which perhaps is the
reason why dear Lady VESTA has taken it up so warmly, but it is certainly
striking, and suitable for girls of a rheumatic type of beauty.
Mamma and I were not at the Ball. You know, dear, that the DE LACT
UNDERWEARS, for all their wealth and high position, are not quite in our set.
They made their money in a large lingerie emporium in Regent Street, which I
have often delicately puffed in the papers to which I contribute. Besides this, we
were not invited, and you know that even journalistes of position cannot well go
to a house after all their efforts to obtain an invitation have been unavailing.
Noblesse oblige, my dear; and we stayed at home and mended our stockings
withLADDEK AND RUCK'S excellent silk-cotton-wool ; which is really the best and
cheapest now before the public. No house is complete without it. It will tie
up parcels for the post, clean the boys' pipes, act as an excellent substitute for
shoe-strings, make a really dressy necklet, and trip people up if tied across
the stairs. This reads quite like one of those silly advertisements you see in so
many so-called " fashion" articles, but I need not disclaim anything of the kind
to you. Best love, dearest, from your volatile little TICKSET.
P.S.—Do get the new literary novel, A Lone Whisperer. It is published
by DULLER. AND DULLER. Our says it is exactly like life. If I were a man, I
know I should have been an actor. TICKSET.
NOT GENERALLY KNOWN.—Sir ROBERT HAMILTON has been appointed to the
responsible position of Governor of Tasmania, the Tasmaniacs being unable to
govern themselves. The holder of this office, ranks before the Governor of
Hanwell or any other Lunatic Asylum. The most distinguished experts are
of opinion that Tas-mania is not incurable, but requires gentle yet firm treat-
ment. The costume of the people is picturesque, the male Tasmaniacs for the
most part wearing strait-waistcoats. Some persons say that Sir ROBERT'S
official duties in Ireland constituted excellent training for his new work.

PAEAFFIN On,.—You complain that after obeying my
orders, and also spending five shillings on what you eau
that compendium of drivelling quackery—Dyspeptia,
its Cause and Cure,— you^'are very much worse than
you were when you began. You also demand compensa-
tion for the loss of an infant, who did not take kindly to
my prescription of equal parts of liquorice, castor oil,
sulphuric acid, chopped chicory, and laudanum. Yours
is a specimen of the ignorant prejudice with which one
who attempts to benefit his species is sometimes rewarded.
Take soothing syrup last thing at night. If not cured,
don't bother me again with an account of your symptoms.
LUMBAGO.—Thanks for fee. Am glad the complaint is
better. No, there is no cheap edition of Dyspepsia,
its Cause and Cure, published, but you will find it
well worth the five shillings charged for it. It is written
in a graphic and racy style, and is just the sort of book
to read in a railway-carriage, or at the sea-side.
Bishops often quote whole paragraphs from it in their
sermons, without acknowledgment, and the inferior kind
of Nigger Minstrels on the Margate sands could hardly
get on without borrowing from its sparkling pages. In
fact, pirated and disguised extracts from it, form the
stock-in-trade of the Orator, the Statesman, the Philan-
thropist, the Comedian, and the Divine. The exhilara-
tion of spirits caused by its perusal is alone sufficient to
cure most diseases. Its effects on patients who have been
given up by their doctor, is surprising, and almost
maddening. Get it without delay!
AFTER THE PLAY.
Mr. Nibbs. How were you pleased, Sir?
Mr. Punch. I was both interested and amused by the
entertainment at the Criterion. The plot is well con-
structed, but the dialogue is poor, and the principal
characters are carelessly drawn.
Mr. N. I do not quite understand you. Sorely Squire
Chivey
Mr. P. Well, Squire Chivey, who might be a Tony
Lumpkin on a visit to London, is
just the one consistent character
throughout, and the part, rather
exaggerated in the First Act,
is judiciously played by Mr.
GEORGE GIDDENS in the last.
And it is some time since I have
laughed so heartily as I did at
the scene when Squire Chivey,
slightly the worse for liquor,
has an interview with Ada and
old Ingot. Mr. GLDDENS' im-
personation of a really though
moderately inebriated noodle,
is in excellent contrast with
Mr. WYNDHAM'S acting of
Garrick's mock violent intoxi -
cation in the preceding Act. There can be no comparison
between the two. They are both illustrations of BELOT'S
saying, "L'ivresse se traduit de différentes manieres, suivant
la qualité du vin et d'après le tempérament du buveur."
Mr. N. But the character of Oarrick
Mr. P. Well, I am bound to say, that the hero might
as well have been called SHAJCSPEABE or BETTERTON, or
KEMBLE, as GARRICK, for there is nothing in the part,
either as written by the author, or as represented by the
actor, which to my mind recalls any of the historical
characteristics, physical or moral, of the fiery little DAVT.
But let this pass: the author chote to make it Garrick,

BANCROFT, who played Peg to perfection—I had seen several Pegs
before her—bore no more resemblance to any one of the portraits
of MARGARET WOFFINGTON (with whom, by the way, little DAVT was
at one time in love) than does Mr. CHAULES WYNDHAH to any portrait
of DAVID GARRICK. When ROBSON played the little actor who is mis-
taken for Garrick, in Garrick at Last—this was, 1 think, the name
of the farce—his stature, and his nervous manner, greatly favoured
the error. Mr. WÏNDHAM'S Garrick is not the real Garrick, but
the ideal, with whom Ada Ingot falls in love.
Mr. N. You liked Mr. WYNDHAM in this?
_Mr. P. In the First Act, excellent. His air of quiet amusement,
his revelling in the idea of some sort of odd adventure, his humouring
old Ingot, all excellent. In the theatrical speeches, too, of this
part of the performance, the actor admirably interpreted what, I
suppose, was the author's meaning. But the sudden inspiration
that strikes him, as to the means he is going to use in order to
disgust the lovesick girl, is not sufficiently emphasised. His manner
of announcing his intention to old Ingot conveys the idea that he
has come with his scheme ready cut and dried. Call the hero " Gar-
rick," and he could not, for an instant at least, have repressed the
visible delight which such a "Happy Thought" must have caused
him. His action and exclamation should have electrified the house,
and utterly staggered old Ingot,
Mr. N. The Second Act, Sir, how did you like that?
Mr. P. I thought it too long. Preposterous! Mr. BLAKELEY was
as amusing as he always is, but the author has scumbled in these
minor characters anyhow. The Act is entirely on Mr. WYNDHAM'S
shoulders, and it is a burden which he bears wonderfully. The
drunken scene, which should be painful and not comic, would
appear less tedious if the dramatic motive were made clearer by the
conduct of Ada and her father. Here a great opportunity is lost.
The girl's should have been a very fine part,—the heartbroken agony
of her horror should have been within an ace of forcing her doting
old father to reveal the secret. As it is. her sudden start into
indignant and majestic womanhood, in ordering Mr, Garrick to
leave the house, has nothing whatever to lead up to it.
Mr. N. And the Third Act?
Mr. P. The Third is the author's best. Here we see what the
characters were really intended to be. Ingot, the fond, foolish old
father, so weak-minded that he is like " The shallow pot, soon hot,"
cursing his disobedient daughter one instant, and telling her he
didn't mean it the next, attempts no wit, delivers himself of no
flowers of speech, does not talk like a poetical bookseller (as he is
made to do in the First Act) and say better things than Garrick him-
self, but speaks plain homely cockney English, of the period, as such
a man would speak; and in this Act, as indeed throughout, Mr.
DAVID JAMBS does his very best with the materials, except that he
misses one opportunity, which if it had made Ingot's part a great
one, would have proportionately injured that of Garrick.
Mr. N. Miss MOORE is a pretty and charming Ada?
Mr. P. Yes—that, and nothing MOOBE. On such a weak bread-
and-butter Miss, Garrick is throwing himself away. I did not
believe Mr. WYNDHAM so capable of conveying his own idea of the
intensity of a situation as he proves himself to be in the Third Act.
But the illusion of the scene's reality is spoilt by the feeling that
Ada will always want him to go on acting, and that she fell in love
with him "in character," and loved him (if the word "love" may
be so profaned) for what he represented, and not for what he really
was. Charmingly pretty, as you say, she is; but even the author's
carelessly sketched Ada Ingot might say, politely adapting Cassia's
speech, Unhappy chance that gave me to the MOORE I'
Mr. N. But I am told that the piece has been altered for Mr.
WYNDHAM since Mr. SOTHEHN played it.
Mr. P. Perhaps so; and if it be improved by the alteration, the
original must have been the very poorest stuff ever penned by Том
ROBERTSON. SOTHEHH'S performance did not so impress me that
I could draw any comparison. I should say Mr. WYHDHAM is quite
as good in this part as was ever Mr. SOTHERN. On the whole, I
spent a most enjoyable evening, and I should say that with David
Garrick Mr. WYNDHAH will fill his theatre for some time to come—
until he takes a fancy to play something else. Au revoir!
"DOWN ON HER LUCK."—In the Bromley County Court (vide Daily
Telegraph's report, Nov. 15), JESSIE KEEN, a laundry-maid, sued the
proprietor of the laundry, one LUCK, for three weeks' wages. "She
was singing at her tub," she said, and that's how it all began.
More sensible this than singing to her tub. However, it appears that
singing had been forbidden by Mr. LUCK. In fact, the laundry-maids
could only sing when the tune was "There's пав Luck about the
Souse." The Judge, however, decided in the Defendant's favour. A
Keen disappointment. Now she'll be more down on her Luck than ever.
THE JELLY-FISH AND THE PHILANTHROPIST.

H KR beauty, passive in despair.
Through sand and seaweed
shone.
The fairest Jelly-fish that e'er
Mine eyes had looked upon.
It would have made a stone abuse
The callousness of Fate,
This creature of prismatic hues,
Stranded and desolate.
Sadly I said: "My mind 's un-
strung,
Love, Hope, are in their grave;
But, ere I perish all unsung,
One Jelly-fish I '11 save.'?
And yet I fancied I had dreamed
How, on some shore unknown,
I met a Jelly-fish who seemed
As utterly alone.
But ah! if ever out to sea
That Jelly-fish I bore, |
Immediately awaited me,
A level thousand more.
I.knew none ever could desist
"Who tried to float them all,—
And, though I am an altruist,
I felt that it would pall.
"And yet, this Jelly-fish," I cried,
"I '11 rescue while I may.
I'll wade out with her through
the tide,
And leave her in the bay."
i She said: "Ah! браге the pro-
mised treat,
Though your intention 's kind;
The sand, the seaweed, and the
heat
I really do not mind.
"The smothering sand, the blind-
ing foam,
Are much the same to me;
I seem to make myself at home
Wherever I may be.
"When wild waves tossed me to
and fro,
I never felt put out;
I never got depressed and low,
Or paralysed by doubt.
"To wander through the mighty
deep
I do not greatly care;
I somehow seem to go to sleep
Here, there, or anywhere.
"'Twas not the ocean's soothing
balm—
No—it was something more.
I 'm just as peaceful and as calm
When shrivelling on the shore.
"It. does not matter what may
come,
I 'm dead to woe or bliss.
/ haven't a Sensorium !—
And that is how it is."
A REAL GRIEVANCE.
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,
To whom can I complain, if not to you?
i Since the second year of our happy marriage
'some little time ago now, my husband has
been accustomed to stop out very late, and come
in very early. He promised me he would
reform. He told me one day that he had become
a member of the Reform Club, and I was
delighted to hear it. The name alone was
grateful to my ears! Alas ! it was but a name,
for, though he belongs to the Reform Club, he
is not a bit better, but rather worse. What is
to be done? I dare say there are many poor
wives whose husbands belong to the Reform
Mending and Ее- Club, but who have not my spirit to address
forming. you. Your broken-hearted PENELOPE.

MEMOIRS OF A SECRET MISSION.
(Extracted from the Diary of Бтто, M. P. )
UITE a crowd of people
at Victoria Station to see
me off. But very polite;
nothing intrusive in their
demeanour; in fact, took
no more notice of me than
if their business on the
premises had been of omite
another character. ;Fiye
minutes before the train
started, a familiar figure
broke through the respect-
;; i ful crowd. A hand with-
,i/l drawn from caress of a
truculent moustache,
pressed mine, and a familiar
voice cried,
"Going away, TOBT, old
man, and without calling
to say good-bye? I know
why that should be. I
understand it perfectly;
still, Ithought you wouldn't
mind my seeing you off.
But what's this?" he
asked, pointing to a label
on which was boldlywritten,
"TOBT, M.P., Passenger to
Marseilles." "You don't
mean to say you 're going abroad in your own name? I know all
about your mission. You're going to see the Prince of MONACO:
you '11 fiad out the Dey of ALGIERS, and the Knights of Malta. I
shouldn't wonder if you had a secret interview with the Doge of
VENICE; and yet you 're going about under your own name, just as
if you were nobody! Royalty, and people like you and me, on
our travels use an alias. LORNE, you know, is booked as " Colonel
CAMPBELL." I have been'heard of as " Mr. SPENCBH." HARCOFHT,
who has royal blood in his veins, avails himself of this privilege.
Why shouldn't you ?"_
"RANDOLPH!" I said, returning his warm grasp, "I will."
And so it came about. Between London and Dover I had all the
labels taken off what we should call in Italy my impedimenta, and
"BITO, M.P." substituted. . I am glad RANDOLPH thought of it.
If now I can only get a few newspaper fellows on my track, it will
be all right.
******
Marseilles, Sunday.—A dirty place, Marseilles, and a smelly.
Houses six stories high, with balconies on which women and children
lounge, and clothes are hung out to dry. Narrow streets, in the
middle of some of which there runs a stream of water, and kneeling
women gossip and wash their dirty linen in public. Muggy weather,
with the sky overcast, and the Gulf of Lvons outside tossing up in-
terminable white caps. It being Sunday, all the cafés are full
of men smoking cigarettes and drinking petits verres; a sprinkling
of soldiers in the throng, for the most part seedy little chaps, whom
the Lifegnardsmen on duty at the Horse Guards could take up and
hold out at arm's-length. At the open door of one café a family
party of six women playing cards and drinking petits verres, the
surplus population not accommodated in the cafes standing about on
the pavements, mostly smoking cigarettes.
But whether in café or on pavement, standing or sitting, every
man and boy carries an umbrella; and such an umbrella! A stout
gingham, sun-tanned, or faded from brilliant hues of blue or scarlet.
In the Ancient Port where the Hiawatha lies at anchor, and where
hundreds of sailing ships, bearing manifold signs of sea travail, are
tied up with their noses to the grindstone of the roadway, small
boats all day pass to and fro. There are generally two persons in
each. One stands up and rows with his face to the prow. The
other stands behind him with an umbrella pendant in his hand, if it
is not raining. If it rains, as it has rained to-day, he opens the
umbrella, and generally makes a friendly effort to shelter the boat-
man, with the result of directing a stream of water down the nape
of his neck. Who invented this curious fashion of journeying across
the water no one knows, but it is invariable. They come and go
all through the day, the man to the fore laboriously tugging at the
oars, and the man abaft always with the umbrella, and always
standing. Saw two men engaged upon the embankment going to
their work, each under the protection of an umbrella. Fancy two
British navvies arriving upon the scene of their labour under out-
spread umbrellas!
Next to the umbrella« are the bells. Day and night they ring out
all round the harbour, the Church of St. Victor calling out to the
bells of Notre Dame de la Garde perched high up to the southward,
the bells of St. Charles, St. Joseph, and St. Martin clanging in.
Happily most of the bells are sweet-toned, or high noon would be a
hard time at Marseilles.
Monday.—Here's an extract from this afternoon's Le Petit
Marseillais.—" Yesterday Admiral Sir Втто, M.P.'s yacht the
Hiawatha cast anchor in the Old Port, later in the day the Admiral
accompanied by his Sailing-master, made the circuit of the Harbour
in his steam-launch. He was, we hear, much impressed with the
superiority of the principal naval arsenal of France, above anything
possessed by la perfide Albion."
'' Later, a rumour reaches us, that the distinguished stranger whose
arrival we reported in an earlier edition, is not what he seems.
Admiral Sir Втто, М.Р., is, we understand, merely a nom de guerre,
under which English Statesmen are now accustomed to travel. We
believe we are right in stating that Admiral Sir Втто, M.P., is none
other than the Lord Duke BELLESFORD, M.P., one of the most daring
officers in the British Navy. It was he who went to the rescue of
the lamented GORDON, and steaming up the Nile to Khartoum, sat
upon the safety-valve of the engine for thirteen hours without light
or food, and so prevented an explosion that must have proved fatal.
Our distinguished visitor declines to he interviewed, and says he haa
merely come to Marseilles to go to the theatre. It is needless to say
that the Authorities of the Port are on the qui vive. At Fort St. Jean
sentries have been doubled. From Fort St. Nicolas a lime-light
apparatus has been prepared, ready at a moment's notice to cast a
flood of light upon the proceedings on board the yacht. La Canne-
bière is foaming with excitement."
Mr. DICK got up steam this morning, and is already pitching about
in the Gulf, stUl turbulent with the Mistral. Poor Mr. DICK! we
all liked him, but are really glad he is gone, for the position was a
little embarrassing. It is a pitiful story. Less than six months ago
Mr. DICK was in full possession of his senses, enjoying the munificent
fortune he had amassed through a life of hard work. Then some-
thing went wrong. I fancy it was in the copper market. Mr. DICK'S
overwrought brain gave way under the shock, and he began to babble
o' green fields and other inconsequential matters. His friends hired
a yacht and sent him out to see what wonders a cruise in the
Mediterranean might work.
A most affable gentleman is Mr. DICK, with wide plans for the
future and a tendency to take passers-by into his confidence.
"I am going," he said to me this morning, across the narrow strip
of water that divides the anchored yachts, "to have a ship built
entirely of copper. I shall fill it with dynamite, and go and destroy
all the ancient cities of the world—the Phéniciens, the Romans, the
Egyptians, the Mummies, and the Tear-bottles."
In the meantime Mr. DICK occupies his time by doing a little oil-
painting. As he lays the colours on with his fingers andf wipes them
off with his pocket-handkerchief, there is some lack of precision
about the detail. But it is very good, quite reminiscent of one of
Mr. WHISTLER'S studieSj as Mr. DICK holds it up for approbation.
Mr. DICK is still bubbling with delight at a sensation he created
yesterday. Being permitted to go ashore, he eluded the vigilance of
his attendant, and entering a grocer's shop in La Cannebiere, said he
wanted some mustard.
"Combien, Monsieur Î" asked the shopkeeper.
"Well," said Mr. DICK, after a moment's reflection, "send me
£40 worth," and he whisked out his cheque-book, and wrote a cheque
for the amount.
He did not mention the transaction on his return, and it was only
when an emissary from the shop boarded the yacht to make arrange-
ments for the defivery of the mustard that the truth came out.
"What did you order such a lot of mustard for ?" our Sailing-
master asked Mr. DICK.
"Why," he said with a genial smile, "I meant to make it hot
for them."
In order to prevent further extravagant addition to the yacht's
stores, Mr. DICK has been since kept a prisoner on the yacht. He
has been determined to go ashore, and as the only available route
was by the water, we are glad that he has been safely got away.
Wednesday.—Not a favourable start in the weather. As far as we
have gone they make it just as good in England. Sunday no sun-
light, close and cloudy. Monday the Mistral blew furiously, cold
ind still dark. This morning transformation scene, the clouds all
blown away, a blue sky spread over an almost bluer sea. Steamed
out of the Harbour past the group of Islands, just off the city, and so
into the open Gulf. The sea still heaving with the late gale. When
we got off Cape Sioie the wind freshened up, all on board are of
course veteran sailors, but we were all secretly glad when the
Sailing-master called out " Yere! Yere! Yere 's Hyères!"
Hyères is a delectable place, and if we cannot get any further
East, we are content to spend a day here. But alas! we stay with a
difference. We are bound to drop anchor nearly two miles from the
coast, and the sea is so rough, even in the Harbour, that no boat can
reach the shore. Indeed, we have presently to shift our anchorage.
Squall follows squall, the rain beating like musketry on the deck,

and the wind whistling weirdly through the rigging. More than ever we con-
gratulate ourselves on the happy thought that made us leave London in November
ш search of summer seas and skies. The Sailing-master says 'twas ever thus,
and reminds us that Isaac of York, sometime the companion of Ivanhoe, recalls
how " in the Gulf of Lyons, I flung over my merchandise to lighten the ship,
while she laboured in the tempest, robed the seething billows in my choice
silks, perfumed their briny foam with myrrh, and enriched their caverns with
gold and silverwork." That was all very well in the time of Isaac of York,
but the Gulf of Lyons has since had time to learn better. o^
Thursday.—Steam up, and made for the open Gulf, hut did'not get beyond
the open portals of the Harbour. The sea worse than ever; incessant squalls
and rain. Moreover, the wind got round to the East, and bites shrewdly as it
did in Hamlet's time. After a brief battle gave up the attempt to put to sea;
anchored nearer town. Steward and boat's crew went ashore in search of fresh
provisions. Found things ashore rather worse than afloat. The town, which
nestles under a hill, some two miles distant from the coast-line, inaccessible
owing to floods. Oldest inhabitant does not remember such fearful weather at
this time of the year. It has, moreover, lasted, in less or greater force, for
a month. Came across a swart mariner, captain of a felucca, who reports that
he has been thirty-three days on a voyage that ordinarily takes him thirteen.
Nothing to do but to remain on board the yacht. All morning a heavy swell,
which incessantly rocked the vessel. Three French men-of-war at anchor close
by, engaged upon gun-practice. In the chopping sea the targets enjoy unvaried
security. Sometimes we wonder if a stray shot may strike us! We wonder, but
no one seems particularly to care how it may turn out.
"What a day we are having, to be sure!

THE TEMPTER.
TKMPTKB and Toiler! Demos, and despoiler of labour's tribute as of
wealth's fair store;
A troubled land's twin portents, there they stand. Not hand in
hand—not yet, or the fierce roar
Of the hot hate that only blood can sate were at our gate. Who,
who will read aright
The meaning written in this scene, red-litten
With danger's lurid light P
It is the! hour to read it. Heed it, heed it, 0 high-placed holders of
our power, our purse!
Light mockery now, cold pride's uplifted brow, will bring, anon, a
stricken nation's curse.
One gaunt grim shadow o'er our El Dorado of civic opulence and
splendour lies,
Sombre, unlif ting, as the ceaseless drifting
Of tempest-darkened skies.
Some legend olden of a city golden, with aureate streets and courts
"and towers, tells.
Serene, sun-litten, fair, yet wizard-smitten at last by the most
sinister of spells,
What [time it slept a shapeless shadow crept, a shadow small as any
summer cloud,
Between it and the blue; it grew and grew,
Till it became a shroud.
A shroud all-covering like some night-bird hovering above that golden
city, till the gleam
Of tower and wall beneath that deadly pall died like the lustre of a
night-struck stream;
Died slowly, wholly; till the melancholy requiem of hooting owl and
bittern harsh,
Rose sad, rose only through the silence lonely,
Of pand-wo&te, mound and marsh.
Is there no shadow fleets athwart our streets? Is [not our golden
Babylon haunted too,
By spectres grim that half its brightness dim, make pale the sunshine
and make sad the blue?
Whatsis this swelling cry which rises high and higher from the
myriad throats of Toil?
Must they who moil and moan be left alone,
The Anarch Tempter's spoil?
Demos and Demogorgon seem to meet, grasp hands and greet in many
a neighbouring land.
Here also must they close as friends not foes, make common cause,
strike threatening hand with hand.
Here where Wealth swells so high, and Charity'at the street corner
stands with liberal dole?
Can wealth and pity in our affluent City
March to nobler goal?
What ails the roots of which these things be fruits, the broad founda-
tions whence these woes uprear,
Their spectral faces? Are our social bases firm set in justice, past all
doubt, all fear P
These questions high clamour for clear reply; not force alone, nor
love of civic peace,
Will lay these ghosts, make mute these murmuring hosts,
Or bid these questionings cease.
The Tempter stands! Fierce eyes, destroying hands—hands that
invoke and eyes that promise war.
Anarchy's fruits await his blind recruits, Death's Dead-Sea Apples.
"Break the iron bar
Of Wealth's stronghold, and snatch the hoarded gold your hands
have stored for him.'" the Anarch cries;
Poison his breath, his dark delusions death,
His promises sheer lies.
And yet, and yet the Worker's eyes are wet with weary waiting for
the dawn of good,
//labour fail, if patience naught avail, //hands hang idle, children
cry for food,

What then? The Tempter's answer quickly comes to courts and
slums. Let patriot Wisdom say
If Toil's long woe it can abate, and show
A safer, поЫег way.
Ay; Order must be kept, Mob-riot swept from Trade's thronged
way and Fashion's pleasant walk.
But after? Not stern force nor careless laughter will lay the ghosts
that through our City stalk.
That civic state where willing hands must wait, helplessly, hope-

IN THE COURT OF COMMON SENSE.
(Before ifr. Justice Punch, without a Jury. )
Bramwell v. Baylis.—This was a case of some considerable im-
portance, involving two questions—(1) Whether a Legal University
ever existed; (2) Whether Ser-
jeants' Inn was a part of such
University. Mr. Justice PUNCH
decided in favour of the Defendant
on both issues, and reproved the
Plaintiff for the unnecessary vio-
lence of his language.
County Court Judges v. Lord
Esher.—Щ. Justice PCNCH said
that in this case each side should
pay its own coste; and he further
intimated that it would be neces-
sary to bind over Lord ESHER to
hold his peace towards all Her
Majesty's subjects, especially after
dinner, for the next six months.
The effect of this post-prandial
order will be extensively felt and
universally appreciated.
Cavendish-Bentinck v. Oldrid Scott.— Mr. Justice PUNCH gave
judgment for the Defendant, and added, that the only order he
should make in this case would be that Mr. BKNTINCK must study
Architecture for the next five years, and keep his knowledge to
himself.
Mr. Justice PUNCH said that he was constantly receiving letters
on matters subjudice, which it was hardly necessary to say he never
read. It was, however, with great pleasure that he announced the
receipt of the thousandth and last post-card on the result of the
SEBRIGHT case, containing the same joke. "If I had the
offenders before me," observed the learned Judge, severely, "I
should not be inclined to let them off 'Scot-free.'" (Applause in
Court, which was instantly suppressed.)
Quiet Londoners v. Socialists and Salvationists.—Mr. Justice
PUNCH said, that this was just one of those cases with which this
Court, and this Court alone, possessing as it did unlimited powers to
pronounce on matters of every conceivable kind, could satisfactorily
deal. Londoners wished Sunday to be a day of rest; a day when they
could, if they were so properly minded, attend to their religious
duties, and enjoy healthful recreation in the Parks, quiet and peace-
able perambulation of the streets, and that where there might happen
to be free exhibitions of pictures or other works of Art, or where
music was provided in or out of doors, all Londoners should be free
to profit by these and similar entertainments, according to their taste,
without let or hindrance of any kind. The Socialists, said the
learned Judge, have access to all the newspapers; the Press is at
their service. For one worthy man that can attend a meeting, there
are a hundred who can read a newspaper. Such public meetings
as these are an anachronism, and only serve to disgust those whom,
as I should have supposed, it would have been considered desirable
to attract. And this, too, applies to the Salvationists with their
discordant bands, and what they are pleased to call their singing.
Good, quiet, respectable folk cannot enjoy their Sunday in London
as long as this state of things is permitted; and if the annoyance
continues, I shall not hesitate to issue a warrant to bring before me,
sitting as President of this Court of Common Sense, not only the
offenders themselves, but those Authorities whose mistaken sense of
duty has led to the present abuse, by certain parties, of that freedom
which is the birthright of every Briton, and in the perfect enjoyment
of which consists the Lawful Liberty of the Londoner. (Great
applause, in which everybody joined as the Judge left the Court. )
MRS. RAUSBOTHAH saja she is glad to hear that Colonel FRÄSER
was handsomely complicated by the LORD МАТОВ on the recent
excellent police arrangements.
THE COMING WINTER.
A TRAGEDY IN BLACK AND WHITE.
"WE see the Coming Winter," say the children, "in our dreams
One round of endless holiday the merry Christmas seems.
There is a good time coming of feasting, fun, and rhymes,
Of clever conjurors by day and nightly pantomimes!
Good Santa Claus will hover, round the Household as we sleep,
And bring us costly toys to break, and pretty books to keep;
There '11 be pudding, pie, and pastry in a world too sweet to last,
All in the merry Winter that is coming on so fast 1"
"We dread the Coming Winter," sigh the children m the street,
"For the cold it chills our bodies, and our shoeless little feet.
About the shops we wander, to the Market down our way,
With eyes too tired for weeping, and hearts too sad to plav.
We are hungry in the morning, and go starving to our bed.
And it can't be ' Jolly Christmas' when we want a bit of bread;
We may cry for food to Mother; she '11 have nothing left to give
In the long and dreary Winter that is coming—if we live!"
"I love the happy Winter!" laughs the careless-hearted lass,
As she turns to love herself once more before the looking-glass.
"There'll be country-house and covert, there'll be pictures and the
play,
And skating till the night-time, and dancing till the day;
There '11 be lots of pocket-money for the girl who only knows
To frill her pretty neck with lace and advertise her hose!
The boys are coming back, and bring their College friends no doubt,
In the cheery Coming Winter when the money flies about!"
"Ah, God! the Coming Winter !" sighs the maiden at her wheel;
"If only our young sisters there, could picture what we feel!
If only pretty virtue could but know how we begin
To break off from our praying and in fancy dream of sin!
We are dying at our sewing, as the cruel wheel goes round,
And we dream about the river and the noisome underground.
We were not born for sorrow, but it hurries on us fast.
Before the Coming Winter, that will shiver us at last!"
"Confound it! here 's the Winter I—oh! it outs one like a knife,"
Cry the boys, who, like the children, break the little toys of life!
"Let us shirk the beastly weather, and unite the night and day
In one long and festive gambol that Society calls play.
There '11 be baccarat and poker when we make our little " pile,"
And swindle one another in a gentlemanly style!
He's a fool who thinks of working, there's the odd trick and the
rub,
So we '11 sort our Christmas Cards like jolly fellows at the Club!
"Can I face the Coming Winter and its miserable ways?"
Asks the threadbare shabby fellow who has known his better days.
They shun him who have robbed him, and they cut him in the street,
For grim poverty has stamped him from his head unto his feet.
He hasn't nerve to cringe to them, and hasn't heart to think,
So he shambles round the corner, and he warms himself with drink.
'Tis the only food that nourishes forgetfulness—alas!
So he toasts the Coming Winter from the poison in his glass!
"About the Coming Winter?" asks the husband to the wife,
As they rub along together, in their calm contented life.
"There's the orthodox subscription that perhaps we ought to give,
For they tell me these poor creatures find it very hard to live!"
"Well, be just before you're generous," says the matron to her
spouse,
"For if you 've to pay the carriage, / have got to keep the house I"
So they order up their dinner, since they 've other fish to fry,
And elect to think about the Coming Winter by-and-by!
Look up, good Mr. DIVES I from the table where you dine.
And hear the men who murmur, and the little ones who whine.
Go out into the highways and the byeways, and behold
The truth, or the deception, of the saddest story told!
It may be some are thriftless, and many more who walk
And curse their empty pockets, spend their toiling-houra in talk.
It may be this, it may be that, that causes them to fall,
But the cruel, crawling Winter! it is coming on them all!
Go! tell the little children to sacrifice their fun,
Remind the giddy women, "What is Pleasure when it 's done?"
Say to the boys who gambol, "A better life begin,
Assist a wretch from starving and a woman's soul from sin I"
This is no time for dreaming! they are drowning within reaeh!
Fling out a rope to save them! let us practise what we preach.
There is wailing, there is weeping, there are bodies on the rack,
Let us face the Coming Winter! and attack it back to back!

POOR LETTER ' H."
"HAVE YOU OOT ANY WHOLS STRAWBERRY JAM 1 "—" No, MlSS. ALL OURS IS QUITE NEW I"
LIGHT TOR THE LEAGUE.
THE Secretary of the New Liberal League, just established "to secure the oo-qperation of
men and women in Liberal work, and especially in counteracting the machinations of the
Primrose League," haying invited "Liberals and Radicals of all sections and both sexes to
forward any suggestions they may wish to make, which will assist the Committee who have
been intrusted with the drawing up the rules and constitution," has already received the
following encouraging communications that have been submitted to him for his guidance :—
A " LIBERAL CHAMPION" writes :—" To combat, as you suggest, the machinations of the
Primrose League, what we Liberals require is, an organisation of a similar, but overwhelmingly
superior character. "We must crush our enemies by smiting them with their own weapons.
And this is how I would do it. To begin with an emblem. Let the Liberals take the sunflower.
It is at once popular and showy, and has this immense advantage over the primrose, that when
worn in the button-hole it is unmistakable. The League, therefore, should be known as the
"Sunflower Leaçue." Then the Knights of the League should, on all public occasions, wear
some distinguishing dress. The badges of the Primrose League have been a success. Why
should not the Sunflower Knights carry the principle still further, and appear in full chain-
armour? The Dames too might wear some appropriate courtly costume of rich silk brocade
that would, on the same lines, invest the meetings held at the various 'Habitations' with
impressive dignity. Then these meetings themselves, that should be given at the mansions
of the Dukes, Earls, and Barons holding high office in the League, should be celebrated by
champagne banquets, to which the navvies, coalheavers, and bricklayers, and all who represent
its humblest adherents, should not only nave free access, but be specially summoned and
earnestly invited to attend. The canvassing, too, for recruits should not be confined to the
mere distribution, as in the case of the Primrose League, of coals and blankets, but comprise a
right royal largesse, involving the unstinted giving away of suits of clothes, household furni-
ture, legs of mutton, unlimited groceries, barrels of beer, and a full supply of the domestic
necessities encountered in each individual household of the new associates. The matter is
simple enough, and only wants testing in operation. I am convinced that if essayed under
such conditions, the New Sunflower League would have an enthusiastic following, capable
of sweeping down all opposition, and of outrivalling any hostile political scheme whatever."
An " IMPECUNIOUS PATRIOT" suggests as under:—" To my thinking, what is wanted is a
permanent guarantee fund, from which a handsome salary could be paid to an efficient
organising Secretary. And for that post I beg to submit myself. I have a wonderful
working scheme in my head, the which, on being duly installed in the appointment, and
having a quarter's stipend in advance, I
should be ready to disclose."
An " ELECTIONEBHING MAIDEN "writes:—
"You appeal to your supporters of 'either
sex,' but I do not think you recognise how
far more efficacious than the male is the
female element as a compelling political
power. Do yon appreciate the strength
and force of feminine youth and beauty,
when let loose to work its own sweet will on
the loafing denizens of eome river-side
slump I tell you that all the political
theories, urged with ever such adroitness
by the male canvasser on the attention of
the buttonholed bargee, do not affect him
in any degree comparably with the exercise
of a little blandismng coquetry by one of
the softer sex. So be guided, and, while
you men meet together and keep the accounts
of the League, leave the active work of can-
vassing for its interests to us women. Yon
may hold Mr. WILLIAM SIKES unwillingly
for a few minutes by your words, but we
can bind him permanently in a chain
of roses a submissive captive with our
smiles."
"Соммою SENSE" concludes :—" Surely
the proper and only way to set the New
league on foot, and establish it as a power-
ful political agent for the Liberal cause, is
for each one of us to bring to its support
that fund of earnest and personal zeal,
without which no movement, however art-
fully planned out in mere talk, and care-
fully mapped out on paper, can hope to
succeed. And here, without copying the
ridiculous paraphernalia of our Primrose
League rivals, we can at least take a leaf
out of their book. They knew what they
wanted and went at it with all their will.
As an initial step we can not do better than
say to ourselves we will go and do likewise."
AT IT AGAIN!
(Dedicated to the Shelley Society.)
"LAST night the Shelley Society gave what
their programme described as а ' performance * of
Hella», in St. James's Hall. . . . The audience,
full to begin with, gradually thinned under the
depressing influencée of the occasion, and the
most ardent Shelleyite present muet hare felt
relieved when the performance wa» over."—

To bring us heaps of fame;
Although around our mimic stage
The critics furiously rage."

A PRETTY DANCE.
MY I>K\i: MB. РТЖСН,
1 MUST admit that I was extremely surprised to see in the
columns of the Times that the critic of that paper had discovered no
plot in the new ballet at the Alhambra entitled Dresdina. I was
present at the initial performance, and I must confess was deeply
interested in the dance-drama in question. The story was simple but
exciting. A number of Hungarian students are engaged in learning
dancing at a German University, when they are attacked by a band
of robbers disguised as muleteers. They upon this take to drinking,
when the chief of the false muleteers is so shocked by the occurrence
that he and his troupe give up brigandage, and form themselves into
an itinerant street orchestra. A lady (who I cannot help fancy ing must
have been known in those parts as the "Maid of the Mill") appears
and flirte with the reformed robber-chief, but subsequently coqueta

with a nobleman whose property has been reduced to the solitar;
holding of a bundle at the end of a stick and a large wide-awake hat
It must be confessed that both peer and pickpocket are тегу effemi-
nate, and for awhile the Maid seems unable to decide between them
Ultimately, however, she prefers the thief, upon which the noblemai
wanders dejectedly in a ruined castle where he meets some animate«
statues. He practises his steps with these quaint personages, and is
subsequently joined by the Maid herself (who seems on the who!
to be rather a fickle individual, for she has evidently deserted th
ex-robber chief), and the five indulge in a pas de cingue. It is
scarcely necessary to say, that after going so far there is but one
course open to the peer and the peasant girl, and that is immediately
to visit the Palace of Dresden China, and assist at a " porcelain ballet.'
They dp so, and live happily ever afterwards. And yet the leading
"morning paper," declared that Drestlina had no plot! For the rest
the scenery and costumes are simply superb. On the first night, i
number of persons, some of them in morning dress, were callee
before the footlights. "With the exception of M. JACOBI (who hac
composed some very pretty music for the piece) I did not recognise
anyone. I was told, however, that a gentlemau in dark spectacles
was the maker of the dresses, from designs furnished by someone
else. I should say that this ballet will have a long run. It ought to,
as it has capital legs to do it with. Your faithful contributor,
RUSTY Cuss IN URBE.
STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH'S STUDIO.
No. V,—WTCKHAM OF JUDE'S.
"STILL the old place,"
I thought, as I escaped
from the Great Western,
in a regular Oxford cab,
and a regular Oxford day.
"Oxford that scarce
deserves the name of land,'
seemed an obvious parody
from MARVELL, as we
splashed through the yel-
low Slough of Despond
under the railway bridge,
and caught a glimpse oi
the posts in the floods, that

"to the stake a struggling
country bind." Every-
thing aboveground was a
dirty grey, everything on
the ground a dirty yellow,
and the water ran down
the old College walls, in-
side and out, when I
reached St. Jude's, quite
in the old familiar fashion.
"Mr.WïCKHAir.inSir?
yes, Sir," said the porter,
ushering me to the remem-
bered rooms. Old TOTTER
had them when 1 was up.
One never saw him except when he " drew" you for not going to
chapel. As he was too shy to' speak to you when he had captured
yon, the interview was rather painful and embarrassing.
As I stood on the'eccentric wooden step outside WTCKHAM'S door,
and was about knocking, he rushed out like a whirlwind, hurrying
on his gown as he came, and nearly sent me to the bottom of the
stairs. However, he caught me, and held me аз tight as if it were
football, and I trying to run in with the ball.
"Hullo !" he cried in a great cheery voice like the North wind,
here you are, I had given you up. Come on in!" He dragged me
through hie outer chamber, where there were little lecture-tables and
chairs, into " a penetralia." as a learned author has it, and thrust
me into an arm-chair by the fire.
"Not more than one minute to wait," he said; "just off to a
meeting about Шеу Lock."
"What's the matter with Шеу Lock."
"Oh, Ifflier than ever! Dont you see the floods? Don't you
smell 'em V The Master's New Gut 's no good, only a temporary
palliative. If we don't sweep away Шеу Lock, the remains of the
University will soon be in the alluvial deposit of the Thames valley.
Dinner in Common room at seven; I '11 be back at six." •
Then he fled, and I was left to warm myself, and reflect on WICK-
HAM and the new sort of Don. A man's books and furniture tell
you a good deal about him. WYCKHAM'S told me that he was an
energetic, and, eo to speak, multifarious character. His cap and
iword, as an officer of the Volunteer corps, were lying on a sofa.
Two oars with dark blue blades were crossed over a queer old oak
cabinet, full of classics in very crabbed type, and very thick stampe
pig-skin binding. There were some blue crackle vases, and four bi|
boating pewters on the chimney-piece, inscribed with the names о
ancient crews, that WTCKHAM had "stroked." A mummy case
with a gut face, gleaming rather awfully in the fire-lit dusk, scoot
against a wall on which were hung a pair of bats, and a trophy о
spears from the Soudan. The table was littered with College notices
and copies of the Unirersity Gazette, and with high-class Magazines
"Social Sophistries, by R. A. WTCKHAM," I read in the contents о
one, and " Ground and Lofty Tumbling, as a Mode of Motion" b
the same author, in another, a scientific periodical. There was also th
Journal of the Hellenic Society, with an essay on " Cock-fighting i
Ancient Athens, as illustrated by tico Dipylon Vases, by R. A
WTCKHAM."
The signs of WYCKHAM'S versatility and energy were as frequer
in the College notices as anywhere else. "Mr. WYCKHAM willcoac
the College Four, at three." "The College Trombone Society, wi
meet in Mr. WYCKHAM'S Rooms at ten, on Tuesday Evening." "Th
College Browning Society will meet in Hall, on the thirteenth
Essay on Browning's Aversion to finishing his Monosyllables, an
the Bearing of this on his Philosophy of Love, by Mr. WTCKHAM.
While I was turning over these things men were constantly boltin
into the room in search of WTCKHAM; some were in pink, some in
cap and gown, some in boating flannels. They all begged my pardon
and rushed out again; apparently life in Oxford is more energeti
than it used to be. In my time the stroke of the University boa
complained constantly of languor. About an hour after he had gon
out WTCKHAM returned like a charge of Cavalry. "Iffley Loci
has life in it yet," he said. "Now, if you '11 excuse me, I '11 just knod
off all this сотр., and then I 'm your man." He seized a bundleo
Greek and Latin exercises, and hewed his way through them, as i
were, with a red pencil, "blazing" the passages he disliked, correct-
ing, adding, and shouting out to me the more ludicrous solecisms h
discovered. When he had finished, it was time to dress, and I wa
then taken to one of the bare little slitsof bedrooms, the floor damp will
spilth of many tubs, which are the least luxurious of things Academic
Dinner at High-Table Hall at St. Jude's is never exhilarating
There were only three Dons in addition to myself and WTCKHAM
One of them was ¡esthetic and unemployed, the College having no n»
for his gifts, which were chiefly devoted to composing sonnets, an<
virelais. He seemed clever, depressed, and disagreeable, and said a
many things as he could to annoy the clerical bursar, and the Dean
of the Chapel, who either did not understand or did not answer hi
remarks. WTCKHAM plunged with them into dissertations on
University Sermons and Oxford Charities, throwing himself into
these topics as if they were the things nearest to his heart.
He sent for two undergraduates to join us in Common Room, уошц
men so much young men of the world that I own I quailed before
them, and felt it impossible to talk up to their level. But WTCK-
HAM did; he discoursed of hunting, and the county families, anc
the noble youths seemed perfectly at home. They provided them-
selves, however, with excuses very cleverly when WYCKHAJI
proposed to take them on with us to an evening entertainment al
Mrs. NIPPER'S, wife of NIPPER of St. Gatien's.
"You remember NIPPER?" he said to me,—" the man who kept
the bear in his rooms at St. Gatien's? Well, he 's married."
"And what is Mrs. NIPPER like '{"
"You'll see," said WTCKHAM, and led me out to the Parks, where
we arrived at the red-brick house which Mrs. NIPPER styled Elen-
theria Hall. "Liberty Hall" was not sufficiently classical.
The company might nave been called mixed without any sense of
social disrespect. Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, Hindus, Farsees,
and Mingrelian Princes, all of them undergraduates, were there, en-
oying the elegant hospitality. I noticed that whoever was introduced
x> any of these aliens, at once began to pump him with questions as
x> the customs, resources, scenery and religion of his native country.
This greatly embarrassed the foreign undergraduates, who knew but
'.ittle, as was natural in men of their years, about their native
nstitutions. Some of them came from countries which had no
nstitutions at all. The rest of the company consisted of Scotch
'reshmen, middle-aged Dons with puzzled wives, and Psychical
iesearohers. WTCKHAM was soon engaged in thought-reading, or
deciphering the unexpressed ideas of a very pretty young lady. 8°
successful was he in this branch of research, that I really began to
';hink there was " something in it."
But when we left Eleutheria Hall and its exciting society, T\_T^f"
HAM admitted that his success was the result of collusion with tne
young lady. "In fact you may congratulate me, my dear fej'0^1,
which I did very heartily, and still more, when I heard that he nao.
accepted a flourishing professorship of Greek in an Australian Colle? e.
I think WTCKDAM may thrive to be President of the Australian Kf-
rablic, which will be even better than being President of St. Jude s.

LEGAL.
byl. SHAKPÜS, ESQ., Solicitor, 26, Botany Bay Buildings, E.G.
A. GULL,—You are evidently quite at the mercy of your creditor.
Only a very clever Solicitor can get you out of the scrape you are in.
I advise you to consult one. You had better be careful to go to a
lawyer who rives some guarantee for his thorough respectability and
competency (such as a recognised City address, contributing legal
advice to weekly journals, &o.) Without in any way obtruding per-
sonal claims in this column, I may mention that my own office noun
are ten to five, and my fee unusually low.
BESSIE.—Certainly you are legally married. In fact from your
statement, which is very confused, it seems that you have been
married three times over. If so, you have committed Bigamy.
Consult a Solicitor.
LAW STUDENT.—1. No, a Wül had better not be written in pencil
VOL. XCI. A A
on the margin of an old newspaper. 2. Look it up in BLACKSTONE;
you cannot expect me to act as a Coach (without remuneration) for
your forthcoming Exam. 3. The Master of the Hulls is not the
Managing Director of the Aerated Bread Company.
HOUSEHOLDER.—Yes, you can appeal against your Bates, if you
think it worth while to do so. After waiting two or three months,
you will probably, at some time during your summer holidays, when
you are away and have forgotten all about the matter, be summoned
before the Assessment Committee to explain your reasons for appeal-
ing. There is not the least chance of your assessment being lowered,
but there is always the possibility of its being raised as the result of
an Appeal.
J. D.—You say a noisy and savage mastiff, under no control what-
ever, frequently comes over the back wall into your garden. Why
not strew prnssic acid on the grass? You have the right of user of
your own premises. It will cure his barking. N.B.—Be careful to
carry a thick stick with, you foi the next week or so. Owners some-
times resent their dogs' decease, and attempt a battery.
A HUMANE MISTRESS.—No, you have no right to knock the cook down
the kitchen-stairs with a broom-handle, and I fear you may get into
trouble in consequence of having done so, in a moment of forgetful-
ness. Consult a Solicitor, and see answer to A. GübL. Strapping
your housemaid tightly to the handle of the pump, while you
ransacked her box in search of missing forks was also perhaps
ultra vires." Her excuse for wishing to leave, viz., that you
frequently assaulted her when intoxicated, and kept her for two
whole days without any food whatever, would be a good one, if true
But, as you say, nowadays servants never know when they are well
off. Your case is an interesting one, and I should be happy to take
it up—on public grounds.
ENGINEER.—Sharptu on Costs, is the authority on the matter
you ask about. It is an excellent work, and can be obtained at any
Law Stationer's.
TENANT.—You have certainly been unfortunate. The Landlord
has no liability to rebuild the chimney-stack which has fallen through
into your front bedroom, or to put a new roof on in the place of the
one blown off by a recent gust of wind. The fact that the whole
house is infested with a venomous West-African spider, imported by
the last tenant, and that all your family are prostrate with typhoid
fever, from the fact of the parish sewer emptying itself directly into
your basement, does not give you the right to claim damages from
your Landlord, or the Vestrv, or anybody else. A Solicitor's letter
might do good. Try one. We keep blank forms at our office.
DISTRESSED LANDLORD.—Ift as you say, the man you have put in
possession has locked himself into a cellar and refuses to come out,
owing to the presence of six large and ferocious Australian fighting
wombats in the house, which the defaulting tenant—who is now in
Russia—brought over with him in a recent voyage from Melbourne,
I do not see what you are to do. As you remark, it is no use to send
another man in, as nobody would go. Apply to Broadmoor, and see
if they can lend you a couple of powerful criminal lunatics for a day
or two, to enter and overpower the wombats. Meanwhile, perhaps
you could get the people next door to knock a hole in the wall, and so
feed the imprisoned bailiff by means of arrowroot conveyed through a
pipe. Consult a Solicitor.
READY FOR THE ROD.
FIVE thousand and twenty-one teachers employed by the London
School Board have petitioned that august body in favour of their
being allowed, in some shape or other, to administer corporal punish-
ment to refractory pupils. Much has been well urged on the other
side, and the sort of instrument that ought to be used for punishment
is also under discussion.
As it happens the Board have still time to institute further inves-
tigation in the matter, the decision of the question having been
adjourned, it would really be as well if in the meantime the
Members could, by some practical tests on each other, arrive at a
definite conclusion on the subject. The Rev. Mr. DIGGLE, as Chair-
man, could, if intrusted with several specimens of canes and rods, be
safely relied on not to jeopardise his judicial calm by the display of
any unusual excitement in their use. In this way some interesting
experiments might be essayed, and valuable evidence secured, and
no doubt those Members of the Board who are in favour of the exten-
sion of corporal punishment would only be too happy to volunteer
their services for its experimental reception. By the carrying out of
some such arrangement, Mr. DIGGLE would be able, at the next
meeting of the Board, to address it with the authority gathered from
actual experience of the subject, and the matter might then, once
and for all, he definitely disposed of and settled.

Shakspeare at the A.D.O.
TEE A.D.C. Cantaba seem to have achieved a genuine
success with their Henry the Fourth (Shakspeare, 3. W.
CLARKE'S edition), by returning to their old rule of inclu-
ding in the cast members of the Club who had " gone do wn."
Some of these ancestral Shades from the Ha-des Sea ap-
peared, and did good service. ("Gave their Aid d'ye seer"
says Mr. WAGSTAFF.) The A.D.C., some thirty years ago,
used to admit Oxford Dramatic brethren to join their com-
pany and appear on their boards. Henry the Fourth is
a good choice, but, to put it logically and arithmetically,
if HENRY 4 is good, HENRY 8 must be double as good.
Ergo, next time play Henry the Eighth.

OUT OF THE LOST LETTER-BAG.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
THOUGH your delightful Artists reflect
almost the whole of English life in a most
agreeable mirror, do you not think that they
overlook one pretty corner? You will re-
member, Sir, that JOHN LEECH once drew
"The Children of the Mobility." I miss the
Children of the Mobility of to-day from your
Gallery ; though the children of the comfort-
able classes—the garden flowers—are so pret-
tily sketched, the little wild flowers are neg-
lected. Yet one often sees beautiful children
in the dirtiest lanes, as happy as kings, and
in the most touching attitudes. Two or three
days since I passed an ugly hoarding in West-
minster, an ugly hoarding, with an ugly hole
in it. But these greasy boards were the frame
of a pensive little lass in blue, who was sitting
perched there, looking out on the road, like
an unconscious child Mariana. The waste
ground behind her was her enchanted castle,
and she watched the wayfarers with an acci-
dental grace, as if she did not see them!
Then one has seen a tiny nurse of six years
make herself a ladder for her fosterling of
four to climb on, and so reach the giddy
height of the knocker on the door. How
touching is their gaiety when the little girls
dance to the music of the hurdy-gurdy, as
gracefully. I am sure, as any contadini in the
native land of the artist with the monkey and
the musical instrument. We don't want fewer
of your pretty drawing-room or nursery
wits, Mr. Punch, but are not the little
humorists of the courts and lanes also pleasant
models for the pencils of your Artists?
Yours obediently, A GREAT UNCLE.

books and little, heavy literature and light,
all await his notice. No wonder the table
groans, no wonder Mr. Punch groans. He
thinks nothing of reviewing an army; but
when he comes to review books, he puts it off
as long ae possible. Taz on books would
doubtless be a good thing. But should know-
ledge be taxed? Are books knowledge P
This opens a wide question, so Mr. Punch
will open a wide book—which is, without
doubt, full of knowledge—The Cruise of the
Land Yacht, Wanderer, by Dr. GORDON
STABLES. There we have the account of thir-
teen hundred miles' travelling in his caravan.
A most delightful way of voyaging, and a
method of living which can never become
vulgarised, as the house-boat stands a very
good chance of. Endless variety, no incon-
siderable amount of adventure, and frequent
change of scene, are the great features of this
book. It abounds in illustrations, and it is
the best book of the kind that has appeared
since CHAULES ALLSTON COLLINS'S incompar-
able volume, A Cruise upon Wheels. It was
COLLINS who may be said to have invented
this system of cruising, more than five-and-
twenty years ago.
Here is another large volume, The Dogaressa,
by MELMONTI—translated by CLARE BRUNE.
It is full of interesting details concerning
the Venice of the past, and Venice past and
present is perhaps the most interesting city
in the world. It also contains a most delight-
ful preface by GEOEQE AUGUSTUS SALA. It
is said prefaces are never read. This will
most assuredly prove a notable exception to
the rule. A capital number is the Century
for December. lîotable amid the contents are
the papers relating to HENRY CLAY, "An
American Beauty,'™ The Hundredth Man,"
by FRANK E. STOCKTON, and "Old Chelsea"
by Dr. MARTIN. The whole of the illustra-
tions are of unusual excellence. Especially
good are those to the last-named paper by
Mr. JOSEPH PENNELL. '' The Girl in the Brown
Habit," by Mrs. EDWARD KENNARD—albeit it
has a little too much "horse" in it—is a
wholesome love-story well told. It would
have been better if it had been shorter.
The Senior Major is another story which
would doubtless gain by being in two volumes
instead of three. However, it is amusing
enough. It is announced as being written by
PHILIP GASKELL. But certain evidences lead
one to imagine it is the work of a lady. It is
quite a new thing this strange mania for
Ladies writing stories of military life. Pos-
sibly it has been inspired by the success of
the Author of Booth's Baby. That lady has
just brought out a clever little story called
Mignon's Secret, in which some of the cha-
racters in her former work reappear. It is
lightly touched, and has somewhat a tragic
termination. It is easy to imagine we have
not seen the last of Mignon yet, by a long
way. Regimental infants promise to be as
profitable as Helen's Babies. Manners
Makyth Man is not a book on etiquette. It
is a series of Essays by the Author of How
to be Happy though Married. By its study
it will doublées contribute to happiness, even
though the reader may be wedded either to
his own opinions or somebody else's. It will
also be read with considerable pleasure and
profit by the single, and ought to become as
popular as its predecessor. Spoilt by Matri-
mony, by E. JAHN, is another view of a
popular institution which those desiring to view
both sides of the question should not neglect
to peruse.

House of Entertainment, his first piece will be
The Butler: to which performance it is pro-
bable Mr. Punch will devote one of his Pages.

TERES, Friday.—
Wind etill fresh,
and the Gulf still
lively, bnt deter-
mined to make a
bolt for it. Can't
be pottering
about here for a
month, getting
varied views of
HyOres from di-
¡ vers points of the
Bay. So get up
steam, and face
: the terrors of the
Gulf. Not so bad,
after all. The
wind has fallen,
but there is a
heavy swell on;
sky overcast, but
light enough to
shed on the Medi-
terranean alovely
soft greenish
light. Here and
there, for no
apparent reason, the colour breaks into wide patches of dark blue.
Can even see a thin ripple of white where one colour meets the other.
On the right hand a waste of greenish water breaking somewhere on
the shores of Africa. To the left a charming coast, made up of dark
purple hills and islands, with here a white lighthouse, and there a
red-roofed house standing in a terraced garden. Passing Cannes, a
cluster of white villas nestling under a hill, and Antibes, with a
cluster of islands doing sentry duty at the Cape. Long before Nice
was anything more than a blurred white patch, we could see the
long range of the Maritime Alps crested with snow. The sky was
still dark overhead, but there was evidently a sunny land some-
where, a band of pale blue sky showing above the snow. As we
drew nearer, the blue sky and the snow-clad Alps disappeared from
view, and, when near enough to make out the houses of the town,
there was nothing to be seen but the nearer and lower hills with
verdure clad. Dwellers in Nice, shut in by this lower range of hills,
know nothing of the white world that girdles them to the north.
Entrance to the little harbour exceedingly pretty. Buttressed by
the Castle Hill, which, with the sunlight upon it, looks more like a
chef-d'œuvre of Scenic Art under the direction of AUGUSTOS DETT-
ÄIOLANU3 than an actual site for dwelling-houses and a garden for
live palms, orange-trees, the cypress, and the aloe. The tiny har-
bour is a delight to the eye. It was nearly full of little ships, by the
side of which the Hiawatha looked like a Triton among the minnows.
On the land side houses are built up close to the quays, and the masts
of the schooners seem to be poking in at the first-floor windows.
One steam-yacht lay among the miniature fleet in the harbour.
There seemed something familiar about its build, and there, sure
enough, upon the deck, boldly dashing colours on his canvas with his
fingers, and wiping them off with his pocket-handkerchief was
Mr. DICK.
Saturday.—Earning this morning just like it does in dear old
Scotland. The fair promise of last night broken. Save that the
temperature is higher, our November day on the Riviera is very much
like what is probably lowering by the banks of the Thames. There
have been terrible times here lately, culminating in the storm of
"Wednesday when we were dodging about the Bay of Hyères. On
Tuesday evening it began to rain and poured all night. On Wednes-
day the wind rose to a gale and drove the mad Mediterranean dead
on shore. At various points it broke up the Promenade des Anglais
uprooting the palm-trees, and carrying clean away the fringe of
tamarisk bushes. Hear to-day of an English yacht driven ashore
and becoming a total wreck. At many points along the coast, the
heavy rains have washed away the railway embankment, and the
railway conductors enjoy themselves more than ever, creeping along
at a snail's pace past dangerous places.
Nothing to do on a day like this but go to Monte Carlo. The
tables all full and the balk a-rolling. What a pitiful sight it is!
Not sure whether I would not as soon spend an hour or two in the
company of dipsomaniacs. Monte Carlo has the advantage inasmuch
as the gamblers are quieter than the drunkards would be; but the
surrender of body and soul to the vice is as complete. Of course there
is a sprinkling of casual visitors who stake their francs or their
napoleons and go their way without being any the worse. But the
habitue of Monte Carlo is quite a different person. The men are bad
enough, but alas! the women. For the most part they are to-day
a singularly dowdy lot. The passion for roulette or rouge et noir
leaves no room for indulgence in feminine vanities. Here was one
woman, evidently of the bourgeoise class, dressed in black. She had
a little bag on her arm and looked as if she had stepped in on her
way to or from market. But the little bag was full of five-franc
pieces and half napoleons, and she went on, steadfastly watching the
game, and now and then staking upon its chances. Close by was
another equally plainly dressed, who played at higher game.
Frequently she nad twenty napoleons distributed over the table at
the same time. Was losing heavily, but beyond an occasional twitch
of the lips, made no sign. It was otherwise with her unfortunate
husband who stood behind her. A little spare man with deeply
wrinkled brow, when the croupier drew in a larger than usual pro-
portion of his wife's stakes, he shook his head, folded his arms,
moaned "Mon dieu! Man dieu !" and walked rapidly a few paces
up and down on the skirts of the throng at the table. But he, too,
had the soul of a gambler, and when all her napoleons and five-franc
pieces were gone, Ъе produced from an inner breast pocket a hundred
franc note, taking it out slowly as if he were tearing out his heart,
and gave it to her.
Close by were another pair, husband and wife. They were com-
fortably seated at the table each with a piece of paper on which was
noted the course of the game. They were more prosperous, and some-
times came in contact with each other, as contrary to the prevailing
practice, they half rose from their seats to grab at their respective
winnings. The man had two little boxes fitted to hold napoleons. As
these emptied he visibly aged, when in a stroke of luck they were
filled to overflowing, his wrinkles were smoothed out, his eye
brightened and I fancied he was meditating upon the desirability of
presenting his less fortunate wife with a five-franc piece. If so, he
thought better of it. A little lower down was a comfortably dressed
homely looking lady. She never staked more than a five-franc piece,
placing it on the board with conspicuous precision and neatness.
Behind her stood her daughter with a sheet of note paper, recording
the successive numbers marked at the roulette table. Fancy these
family arrangements—mother and daughter, husband and wife,
setting out immediately after breakfast to spend a livelong day at
the gaming-table!
Perhaps the strangest eight of all was a poor shrivelled old woman
who had certainly lived her three-score years and ten. Her appear-
ance betokened a condition of absolute penury. She wore a dress of
rusty black, constructed on principles of rigid economy with respect
to quantity of material. On her head was an ancient bonnet, melan-
choly with the adornment of some cheap flowers. Her skinny hands
were gloved in yellow cotton; her left jealously guarded a treasure-
heap of three five-franc pieces. If her neighbour on the left had any
designs upon them, he must long ago have abandoned them. As long
as I was there she did not play, but industriously recorded the
various figures cried aloud by the croupier. She too had a system,
and her precious fifteen francs may yet be instrumental in breaking
the bank. The old lady, like all the rest of the players, did not speak;
only the voice of the conpier calling "faites le jeu, on ne ra plus,
broke the ghastly silence that brooded over the handsomely appointed
room. Looking round at the faces, not one pleasant to the eye, I
thought of the famous "party in the parlour, all silent and all
damned."
Mr. DICK finally disappeared; a yacht found to be on the whole,
not the most convenient locality for him. So the voyage has been
brought to a sudden conclusion, the yacht is now beading for Scot-
land, and Mr. DICK, accompanied by his medical staff, is going home
overland. He is, however, still resolute in his design about building
the copper ship, and relentless in his deadly purpose with respect to
the ancient cities.
Sunday.—The sun at last—on its own natal day. Transformation
scene complete, and Nice revealed in its true colours, as one of the
most beautifully situated and handsomely built cities of the Continent.
Walked to town through the market, which spreads itself out all
along at the back of the Promenade du Midi. Seems to be part of
the religious service of the working classes to go to market and buy
a cabbage on Sunday morning. _ Quite a procession of clean healthy
looking noueewives each swinging her cabbage. Till yon get used to
it, a little dangerous walking about the streets. The cochers make a
point of driving at full speed, especially round corners. Never saw
such an odd collection of horses in the public service. Look as if the
majority had entered upon _life in the circus business, passing on
thence to more prosaic work in the streets of Nice. They, moreover,
develope a curious tendency towards local disturbances. Sometimes
the head seems to swell, or to diminish out of all proportions to the
body ; or the neck grows unnaturally arched or alarmingly elongated;
or the f orequarters do not appear to have anything whatever to do
with the hindquarters. The Sailing-master explains this phenomenon
upon the theory that at night all the cab-horses are taken to pieces
and stowed away, being hastily put together in the morning with the
results noted. That certainly seems a plausible explanation, but I
cannot find anything about it in Baedeker,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Much interested this afternoon in watching the inhabitante who
flock down to the pier and stare at the yacht or each other. On the
day we were moored, noticed on the pier two stalwart men in high
top-boots. Had taken off their coats, turned up their sleeves, put
their hands in their pockets, and looked out with resolute regard,
evidently ready to do anything and go anywhere. In the meantime
there they are to-day, as top-booted, as ready, and as resolute as
ever; but still with their hands in their pockets. Cannot fully
express the satisfaction it is to know that those two men are there.
Supposing a fire were to break out on board, or a leak suddenly to
disclose itself, here is help close at hand.
A good deal of fishing goes on in the harbour; a very serious
business, not to be undertaken with a light heart. To-day came
two elderly gentlemen of severely respectable mien. Guess they
were^Town Councillors, perhaps Deputies. Armed cap-à-pié pour
la pêche. One, the graver man in spectacles, had two bags, one
slung across either shoulder. Nothing like being prepared for emer-
gencies. Too exasperating to haul in the fish by the dozen, and not
have wherewithal to carry them home. Both carried fishing-rods of
stupendous proportions. Remained there so long that I forgot them.
Then a bustle apparent in the little group at the pier-head. The
gentleman in spectacles had caught something. As far as I could
make out, with the aid of an opera-glass, it was a sardine! Pretty
to see the air with which he placed it in the larger of the two bags.
Prettier still to note how his less fortunate companion ignored the
whole proceeding.
Interviewed the Prince of MONACO to-day. Most important com-
munications; but hold over till next week.
MR. PUNCH'S CHRISTMAS NUMBER.
THE Sage of Fleet Street regrets to say that the affairs of the
world in general, and Europe in particular, having recently become
extremely "mixed," require all his attention, and consequently he
will be unable to publish a Christmas Number, to take its place with
those of his pictorial contemporaries. This is the more to he regretted
as the work was in a forward state of preparation, the stories having
been sketched out and ready for illustration. As a novelty, the tale
deals with the Law, and is called Л Family Suit, or Bound to a Bar.
As a matter of interest, he subjoins a list of designs that had already
been selected with the wish that it may be of service to some deserv-
ing family paper, say the London Journal.

MALCOLM GRAHAM at Midnight. VI. MARK MUDFOBD shows GASO-
LINE the brief by LAWSON'S grave. VII. Scene in the Court, the
Judge refuses MARION'S application. VIII. Lawyer BBOTHEBHOOD

Such subjects as the above, treated in the proper way, ¡should
secure an enormous circulation.

MB. HENBY IBVINQ (for whom, with the reat of the world, I
feel the profoundest respect) having successfully "freshened up"
Faust by introducing the Kitchen Scene," with a prospect of
future refreshers in the shape of yet-to-be-produced additions, will
you allow me to suggest that the system might be adapted to other
plays. Take, for instance, Samlet. Say tbat this noble tragedy
were produced in January, it might run the whole year with a little
judicious management. I will give a Calendar, to better explain my
meaning.
January.—First representation of Hamlet, pur et simple.
ЛГагсЛ.—Interpolation of Prologue, in dumb show, illustrating
funeral of Hamlet's father.
May.—Date for introducing vision to accompany Ghost's explana-
tory speech, when seen in Hamlet's "mind's eye—Horatio."
July.—Panorama of Hamlets voyage to England.
November.—Tableau of the Prince's childhood. Hamlet mounted
on the back of YoricTc.
September.—Introduced episode of the Inquest on Ophelia.
Christmas.—Grand spectacular finale. The Victory of Fortin-
bras. As the above programme would, from a sartorial point of
view, be a decided advance in the right direction,
I beg to sign myself, A SHAKSPEABIAN DBESS-IXPBOVEB.

IN THE COURT OF COMMON SENSE.
(Before Mr. Justice PUNCH without a Jury. )
líe the Fire at Hampton Court.—His Lordship gave judgment in
this matter in the following terms. I have been asked to restrain the
future letting out in lodgings, without rent, of a certain Palace known
as Hampton Court, to the indigent
rich. I am told, that although the
property contained in the bunding,
belongs to the Crown, yet by an estao-
lished custom, the usufruct of the plea-
sure to be derived from inspecting
the contents has passed to the people.
I understand that the letting out com-
plained of has recently been the cause
of two fires, creating considerable
damage, which, moreover, but for a
fortuitous concourse of circumstances,
would have resulted in irreparable
loss. It is before me that the last fire
arose from the upsetting of a para-
fine lamp, in the apartments of. a
tenant, which, however, were "in
the temporary occupation" of a
stranger. I am told that this "tem-
porary occupation," wa» against a rule by which persons granted
the use of the apartments, are restrained from lending or letting
them to anyone else. If this is so, it seems to me that the cost
of the damage should fall upon those who have infringed this
very proper regulation. As no doubt the intention of treating
Hampton Court as a kind of auxiliary to the casual ward is a
benevolent one, I am unwilling to restrain the letting of it for the
purpose indicated. Still, the great pleasure given to thousands
annually, derived from inspecting a number of most valuable and
interesting objects of Art, whose loss could never be replaced,ie much
in excess of the benefit conferred upon a favoured few by allowing
the last to live rent-free. There, moreover, seems to be a doubt that
these favoured few are specially worthy of the indulgence shown to
them. However, admitting for the sake of argument, that they are
eminently worthy persons, I yet am of opinion that they should _be
strictly under control. I order that in future all the "charity
apartments " should be supervised by an official, whose duty it shall
be to punish the infringement of a rule by the immediate expulsion
of the defaulting tenant. A night watchman and fireman must also
be added to the staff.
The Curates of All Saints, Margaret Street v. Whitworth.—This
was an appeal from the decision of the Bishop of LONDON, allowing
the present incumbent of this well-known place of worship to turn
the unmarried clergy out of the presbytery attached thereto, that he
(the incumbent) might have the building for the sole benefit of himself
and family. His Lordship immediately granted the application, and
ordered the Bishop to reverse his permission within a week. The
case to be mentioned again to Mr. Justice PUNCH in the event of any
delay in carrying out the order.
Adams v. Coleridge.—On appeal, Mr. Justice PUNCH declined to
interfere with the finding of the jury in this matter. He said he
considered the verdict in every way a most proper one. This decision
was received with applause, which was immediately suppressed.
In re The People s Palace.—An application was made to his Lord-
ship to prevent the sale of intoxicating liquors in the proposed
bunding about to be erected by the Trustees of the Beaumont Bequest,
and to cause the same Institution, upon completion, to be closed on
Sundays. Mr. Justice PUNCH said that although the same persons
supported the two petitions, the relief sought, if granted m both
oases, would result in causing the very evil which, no doubt, it was
their desire should be remedied. He was bound to say that he had
no great sympathy with the applicants, who, in spite of their pro-
fessions, were, he feared, very narrow-minded persons. However,
giving them the benefit of the doubt, and assuming that their motive
was to benefit their fellow-men, and not to act as tyrants, he would
point out that closing the coming Institution on Sundays would be
the means of driving into the adjacent public-houses those who
otherwise would have visited it. He was not sure that, under proper
supervision, the sale of unadulterated—albeit alcoholic—beverages
would not help the cause of sobriety rather than militate against it.
It might be argued that a glass of wholesome beer, if procurable at
The People's Palace, would serve as a preventive to a visit to the gin-
tavern, but on this point he reserved tas decision. As to the closing
on Sundays there could not be two opinions, and he refused the ap-
plication, with costs. The decree was received with loud cheers,
which were suppressed with difficulty. Silence being restored, Mr.
Justice PUNCH saying that he had to attend a meeting of the Judges,
when no doubt the delays in the Chancery Division (which were
attributable rather to the Chief Clerks than his brothers on the
bench) would receive consideration, adjourned the Court for a week.

New Version of an Old Song.
YOUNG King COAL was a merry young soul,
And a merry young soul was he;
He called for bis pipe, and he called for his
bowl,
And he called for his fiddlers three.
There was CHAMBERLAININI, and HAHTING-

And, GOSCHENI to make up the three;
For young King C., oh, was fond of a tri-o,
Very fond of a trio was he.
Young King COAL left his rivals in the hole,
When he took the Chanoelle-rie
Of the British Exchequer, and, to keep up
their pecker,
They slanged him unmercifull-y.
So himself to cloak from the very provok-
ing jeers of the Rad Part-y,
Young King COAL their old mantle stole,
And a very smart Bad made he.
Young King COAL loved "smoking" in his
soul,
And his Brummagem Best Bird's-eye,
And his "Cavendish," went faster than was
pleasing to the master
Of the House where his new hacoys he would
try.
And our young King C., and his fiddlers

Young King COAL he called for his bowl,

And they all played a symphonee.

And then HAMING-TON-I-N/

And a dickens of a speech made he;
And he talked so loud that he frightened

But as for those fiddlers three,
Whilst the Chorus cried, " We 're diddled!"
they symphonieally fiddled,

Young King COAL still waves his pipe and

Though they reek of Rad flavour still.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

HALL OVER!
(A Dialogue after the performance in St. James'i Hall. )
Mr. Nibbs. Sir, how were you pleased with The Golden Legend at
St. James's Hall last week?
Mr. Punch. Sir, to quote SHERIDAN, I was "in amazement lost"
at Sir ARTHUR StrLiiyAu's skill in
dealing with such a subject. I should
select as the gems, first, the music
illustrating Lucifer's presentation of
the phial to Prince Henry
Mr. N. Played by the phial-linn.
Sir ARTHUR is a musical wag.
Mr. P. Sir. I do not suppose that
such a ridiculous idea ever entered
into the Composer's head in conjunction
with this theme. My second selection
would be the "Kyrie Eleison" which
can be taken bodily out of its surround-
ings, and used in the solemn functions
of the Church. The entire Prologue
is as çood as it can be. ALBAm was
magnificent.
Mr. N. "On such a night," too! It was plucky of them/one
and all, to come out, and they came out strong; but, fortunately, the
fog was partial.
Mr. P. So they describe it. But I wish it were not so partial to
London. Luckily it cleared up at about eight o'clock, or if it had
not, The Golden Legend would still have remained a myth to many
of us. Mr. LLOTD was in excellent voice: so were they all. It was a
fine performance—and that, I take it, is also your opinion, Mr. NIBBS.
Mr. N. I am not qualified, as a musical expert, to be critical. I
liked it immensely.
Mr. P. Some of Sir ARTHUR'S dramatic musical illustrations are
excellent, as for instance the sparkling accompaniment to the pre-
sentation of the alcoholic drink—apparently an effervescing draught
or a brandy-and-soda—by Lucifer; then the gentle inflection to the
right indicating that Prince Henry and Elsie are turning down a
green lane—where the Composer ventures on entirely fresh ground—
and again the halting measure which on every occasion notifies the
advent of the limping Lucifer.
Mr. N. Sir ARTHUR has excelled himself in most instances, yet I
can mention one where he is not quite up to his own old level.
Mi: P. And that is?
Mr. N. In illustrating the stage-direction, " They reach a height
overlooking the sea." A similar situation, you may remember,
occurs in Cox and Box, where Box is describing how
"I solemnly walked to the cliff.1'
• * •
Heard the wild seagulls mournful cry,
Looked all around—there was nobody nigh,
Nono but I—on the cliff so high—
• • •
I stood on the edge of the rock eo steep,
And gazed like a maniac on the deep."
Well, Sir, who that has ever heard SULLIVAN'S wonderfully dramatic
setting of these lines could think of comparing the meagre treatment
of a similar situation in The Golden Legend Í
Mr. P. Let us admit the possibility that the lines in Cox and Box
which you have just quoted are far more inspiring that LONG-
FELLOW'S. Have you any other remark to offer?
Mr. N. I agree with you, Sir, that the Prologue", is the best. The
latter part wants cutting. It becomes tedious,—though this effeci
may be partly due to the absence of any interval, say a couple ot
hundred bars rest, between the two Parts, or between the two Acts,
into which it ought to have been, but is not, divided.
Mr. P. Sir, I am inclined to agree with you.
Mr. N. It is written in Scenes, why not in Acts Í When firsl
I read the book I was struck by such stage-directions as, " «Spire of
Strasburg Cathedral—Night and Storm—Lucifer, with the Powers
of the Air. trying to tear down the Cross"—"disappearing"—
"drinking —'' Villagers disperse "—" Ursula entering the house "—
"They turn down a green lane "—" They reach a height, and en-
camp —and I concluded that there was to be a novelty introduced
into the Novello Series of Oratorio Concerts by having the platform
arranged as a stage, with characters in costume and dissolving views
illustrating the action. However, Sir, once seated in St. James's
Hall, I saw no signs of any preparation for scenic effect; no damp
sheet hung up for dissolving views, and no stream of light from the
, , everyseatfi
up to the back, under the Organ, was occupied by the ladies of the
Chorus in white, and the gentlemen of the Chorus in black. How,
then, were they going to carry out the stage-directions, for evidently
;he_ cantata depended on dramatic action, and must be comparatively
unintelligible without it? Suddenly, on the right-hand side of the
)latform, up among the white-robed Choir, I caught sight of a red
>aize screen. In a second the truth broke upon me! Sir ARTHUR,
with that fine dramatic instinct which he has always possessed, and
which the Savoy experience has developed and cultivated, had taken
a hint from Lieutenant COLE, and a dramatic licence for the St.
James's Hall having been applied for and refused, he had given
eave of absence from the Mikado, for this night only, to Mr. GKORGE
jKossMiin, who, I said to myself, has been stationed behind this
toreen, and will appear from time to time over the top, only half of
lim seen—the better half—impersonating the various characters, and
so giving just that dramatic illustration which, judging by the book,
would be absolutely essential to the complete success of the cantata.
Mr. P. But you soon discovered that you were mistaken P
The screen to which you allude served the purpose of concealing
;he eminent performer who played the bells.
Mr. N. So I was informed, to my great and unutterable disappoint-
nent. And all I can say is, that Sir ARTHUR is perfectly welcome
x> adopt my suggestion, which I am sure, if properly carried out,
would be the nmking of any future performance of The Golden Legend.
Sir. GROSSMTTH would make a capital Prince Henry, and if he
.iked to come out from behind the screen, the use to which he could
jut the legs of the weak-kneed Prince would draw all London to hear
¡he Can-cantata.
Mr. P. You think The Golden Legend would be improved by
developing its dramatic character?
Mr. N. It is written, Sir, as a drama in Scenes. Why should it
be played in the orchestra only? Why not by dramatic players?
Mr. P. I remember Mr. BELLEW did something of the sort. He
read Hamlet, or Macbeth, a chorus sang, and Actors acted in panto-
mime only.
Mr. N. Exactly so, Sir. Let Mr. BENNETT read his book, Sir
ARTHUR conduct, the eminent vocalists and chorus sing, and let
Mr. ОЕОЗЯПТН, in dumb show, represent Prince Henry.
Mr. P. To whom would yon assign the part of Lucifei—a member
of the Tonic Sul-phur Association—and a feeble kind of Mephis-
topheles instead of a " superior person?"
Mr. N. Quite so, Sir—his part should be given to Mr. PENLET,
who played the Curate in The Private Secretary.
Mr. P. And the hysterical Elsie f
Mr. N. My dear Sir—there is only one actress in London who
could play it, either with dialogue or in dumb show.
Mr. P. And she is?
Mr. N. Mrs. JOHN WOOD.
Mr. P. Of course. The Messrs. NOVELLO will do well to give
your valuable and original suggestions their earnest consideration,
and, if unable to procure Mr. GROSSMITH to entertain, and take all
the characters, then they can manage it with dumb-show and dis-
solving views. Perhaps you will see Sir ARTHUR on the subject.
Mr. N. I will, Sir. Good evening.

Fitfully faint, lest we our

In struggling with ob-

With tears we battle till

The muck and mud that

[DECEMBER 4, 1886.

THE WINTER ART EXHIBITIONS
OPENHD LAST WEEK, то тнв DELIGHT OF ALL. OUR ART-CRITIC, WHO SENDS Ив. PUNCH
THE ABOVE, HAS NOT SENT ANT NOTES OR SKETCHES I
A GAME OF WHISTLER.
А HURBIED visit to the Society of British
Artiste has established the fact that the
present Exhibition owes much, very mach,
to the genius of its President, Brevet Sir
JAMES McNEib WHISTLER. Not only has
"the Knight that is to be" (if everyone
has his rights) decorated the rooms in which
the pictures are displayed with the greatest
Cible taste, but he has also contributed no
than five inimitable somethings from
hie own atelier. The Catalogue gives the
prices of the paintings, so that it is possible
to purchase the gems as they hang to the
walls. However, it would be an improve-
ment were the sums charged for the frames
also published. Thus No. 306, "As the
Twigi» bent the Tree isinclined" has a frame
of even greater value than the picture,
and yet both are lumped together for £40.
Brevet Sir JAMES gives the prices of two of
his "paintings"—"No. 331, Nocturne in
Brown and Gold, 'St. Afark't, Venice,'
£630," and "No. 369, Note in Blue and
Opal, 'Paitel,' £126." As both these re-
markable productions must have cost the
Artist minutes, if not hours, of patient
labour, it is sincerely to be hoped that he
will get the reward he expects. To the
other three pieces no sums are affixed, the
cost being left in blank. This is as it
should be. Even the most prejudiced must
admit that they are priceless I
In PERTINENT ANSWER.—Preceptor. What
is the Earth? Pupil. Tellus.
ON THE HORIZON.
As a rider to a recently proposed apocryphal European scheme, the
following, emanating from an inspired Parisian source, will just now
be read with interest:—
England, putting her foot down on the Russian candidature of the
Mingrelian Prince, formally declares for the return of Prince ALEX-
ANDER of Battenberg. and installing him together with Sir WOLFF
and Sir WHITE, as advisers at Sofia, by the aid of a regiment of Les
'Orse Guards smuggled through the Bosphorus and landed at Varna
by the Due D'EDINBOBO in a pleasure despatch yacht, summons the
Sobranje and announces the development of the situation.
_The news spreading to Vienna and St. Petersburg, causes an imme-
diate collision of the Russian and Austrian troops, and the European
war commences.
Germany prepares for action, but is confronted by a coalition of
Belgium, Holland, Denmark, and Italy, and France, is left free to
prefer her just demands against England.
The whole of the British Mediterranean and Channel Fleets, having
entered the Black Sea, where they are shut up owing to the closing of
the Dardenelles by the order of the Sultan, the French Government
propose to the Cabinet of St. James's, the immediate evacuation of
Egypt, the handing over the Suez Canal shares to a French Syndicate,
and the cession of the Channel Islands, Gibraltar, Malta, Aden,
Ceylon, the Cape, and certain prominent portions of India and
Canada to the power of France. These pacific overtures being
declined, the invasion of England takes place.
Margate is seized after bombardment, and 500,000 French troops
land at Herne Bay, marching to London, when seizing the Bank of
England they are welcomed as deliverers by the Chiefs of the Social
Democratic Federation, who proclaim the Universal Republic and
declare "'Ome Rule" established iu Ireland, India, and the Isle of
Wight.
Peace is now signed, Bulgaria haying disappeared from the map of
Europe, and England undertaking to pay an indemnity of
£500,000,000 to France.
BRAVO, Prudential Assurance Co. 1 Mr. Punch congratulates Lon-
doners on Staple Inn having fallen into such excellent hands. The
Directors have given the Public their prudential assurance, that
nothing shall be done to the Old Inn that can injure its architectural
and antiquarian value. In future, when anyone wants to know what
may be the little game of the P. A. Directors, he will only have to
request permission to 'see what may be henceforth known as their
Preserve. The purchase is an excellent illustration of what a
Liberal-Conservative policy means: Liberal in buying, Conservative in
keeping what you 've bought in the best possible state of preservation.
A LIBERAL PARTY.
WHILST rival zealots are hotly insisting upon their opposite and
irreeonoileable "conditions of support" to the proposed People's
Palace for East London, Mr. WILBERFORCB BBYANT, who has already
contributed £2,800 " to make up an even sum much wanted at the
time," has now expressed his intention to provide the balance
required (about £4,000) for the completion of the great central room
for concerts and entertainments, to be called the Queen's Hall. So
announces Sir E. H. GURRTE, Chairman of the Beaumont Trustees.
Mr. Punch only hopes that the squabbling zealots, when their singu-
larly troublesome "consciences" are quieted, will do half as well,
and prove half as liberal, as the generous, unconditional, and fitly-
named Mr. WILBERFORCE BRYANT. The Beaumont Fund Trustees
have announced their final intention of not applying for a liquor
licence for the Palace, and also of opening portions thereof at stated
times on Sunday. This is a compromise which, if not entirely satis-
factory to sturdy lovers of liberty, would appear to be a wise con-
cession to the necessities of the situation. It seems, however, that
the Sabbatarian section of the fiery faddists are still unsatisfied, and
still disposed to smash up the great philanthropic project rather than
yield a point, or a pint. These gentlemen will probably soon be found
advocating the disestablishment of the Sun because it shines on Sunday,
and the destruction of all song-birds on the ground that they take
part in Sabbath-Day Concerts of what is not de_monstrably "sacred"
music. After all, tie a poor conscience which dares not be con-
sistent.
I CAN view thee, panting, lying
In asphyxia, without sighing
I unmoved can see thee flying
From this bog.
Expiring Fog!
Farewell, fiends, in shape of boys,
With wild shouts and horrid noise!
Farewell all the marshy joys
Of a frog,

Good-bye, demon Fog, good-bye I

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH'S STUDIO.
No. VI.-THE NEW M.P.
/It*-'

ME. R. C.'HOLMON-
DELEY BROWNE, M.P.,
was not always CHOL-
MONDELEY, and, of
course, was not from
birth an M.P.; nor,
for the matter of that,
did he always spell
his surname with six
letters. There was a
time, now twenty
years back, when he
was known to a wide
circle of friends as
DICK BROWN, and
might be seen any day
in his shop with his
sleeves turned up, and
his hands redolent of
"Wiltshire." He was
a bright, brisk man,
with a wonderful taste
for pure "Dosset," a
nose infallible in
search of good coffee,
and a priceless palate
for tea. Mr. GLADSTONE a year or two ago achieved some renown
by recommending jam as a desirable direction for the extension
of business on the part of agriculturists. DICK BROWN found
this out years ago, and acted up to it. He bought his fruit cheap,
sold hisiam less dear than other people, and'did an enormous busi-
ness. Whatever he touched turned to gold, though in the process it
was subjected to various flavours. For DICK'S hand was in every-
thing, from a barrel of herrings to a barrel of apples, from a pat of
"Dosset" to a Cheddar cheese imported from the United States.
He was up early, went to bed late, and was constantly adding to his
balance at the Bank. This was some fifteen years ago, and it was at
this epoch that DICK got married. Mrs. BROWN meant that DICK
should attain to higher things, and began very early working out her
purpose. First she got DICK elected on the Town Council, a step he
much resented, as it took him away from business. But he presently
discovered that he possessed what he called, in those degenerate days,
"the gift of the gab." He found a thrilling delight in being on his
feet addressing the Town Council, and finding a report of his speech
in the weekly paper. In due time he became an Alderman; then
Mayor with a gold chain, and, finally, Mrs. BROWN had her heart's
delight. She wheedled DICK out of the shop.
This was a difficult task not accomplished in a day or a year. But
Mrs. BROWN proceeded with great skill. By degrees she inculcated
in DICK'S mind a distrust of "Dosset," a dislike of the feel of clammy
bacon, and an animosity to ja_m. The rest was easy. DICK retired on
a competent fortune, took up'his residence at The Towers, a suburban
house with a stucco front, and was for a time supremely miserable.
But Mrs. BROWN kept him and all things going. He was re-elected
Mayor, began to take an interest in politics, enjoying himself more
than ever at public meetings, and at the last general election that
ever was, was returned at the head of the poll for his native borough.
DICK had become R. CHOLMONDELEY BROWNE, when re-elected
Mayor and now M. P. was added. He had been a little puzzled as to
the politics he should adopt. Such convictions as he had tended in
the direction of Liberalism. Mrs. BROWNE was a Tory. In the end,
by way of compromise, it was decided that DICK for rather CHOL-
MONDELEY) should stand as a " Liberal Imperialist. Mrs. BROWNE
invented that word, which of itself did much to win the election.
"Invariably, CmrMLEY," she said, as he went forth to the canvass,
"drag in the word Empire at the end of your speech, and as often as
you please in the middle."
"I will my love," he said; and he was as good as his word.
He, as he once declared in the absence of Mrs. В., made the British
Empire " a line " in the display of his political wares. He clothed
himself in its boundless glory and historical grandeur, and literally
swelled with elation as he denounced some imaginary cravens who it
appeared were actually in treaty for selling their birthright.
CHOLMONDELBY, it should be said, was in personal appearance a
very different man from the DICK of old days. Of course he never,
out of the privacy of his dressing-room, appeared in his shiit-sleeves,
though there he had a tendency (severely reproved by Mrs. BEOWNE)
to n ill them up to his elbows, and lean upon the table.
"I declare, CHÜMLEY," Mrs. BROWNE once said when he greeted
her thus on entering the room, "I thought you was going to recom-
mend some prime Wiltshire, 'just arrived. Do get out of those
disgusting manners."
CHOLMONDELEY looked very well in his black broadcloth, being
rosy-gilled, and acquiring quite a respectable baldness. His manner
in company was quiet, not to say contemplative. He had a really
valuable gift of looking as if he was going to say something memo-
rable. He never did. But who should say what might not happen
to-morrow? Of course Mrs. BROWNE went to Town when the
Session opened. She even sat in the Ladies' Gallery when Сноь-
MONDELEY was sworn in, and heard the lady who sat next to her
(Mrs. SEYMOUR, wife of the Under Secretary for Inland Seas) giggle
when CHOLMONDELEY halted in the middle of the floor, and bowed
right and left.
^'Oh, here's one of those funny New Members," she said.'
wonder what he '11 do next."
Mrs. BROWNE won't forget that, if she gets a chance of putting
things straight with Mrs. SEYMOUR,
Mrs. BROWNE had arranged CHOLMONDELEY'S appearance on the
Parliamentary scene as she managed everything else. It was all
very well for ordinary Members to go in with the herd, and scramble
for copies of the New Testament across a table, and take the oath
ememble. Mrs. CHOLMONDELEY had been in the Ladies' Gallery
before, and had seen newly-elected Members come up singly, after
well-fought contests, receiving the meed of party applause. So
CHOLMONDELEY was kept back for a fortnight, and then came up to
the table all by himself, halting, as mentioned, midway, and salut-
ing first the Ministeriallste and then the Opposition with that suave
courtesy which, in olden times, had often atoned for a lack of fresh-
ness in the last pound of butter 'from stock. The House did
not cheer CHOLMONDELEY, for obvious reasons. Liberal Im-
perialist was, regarded as a party designation a little vague. On the
contrary, it laughed heartily at CHOLMONDELEY'S salute, and his
gills were redder than ever, when, having insisted upon shaking
hands with the Clerk, under the impression that he was the
SPEAKER, he stood on the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER'S
extended foot whilst he signed the Roll of Parliament.
CHOLMONDELEY took his seat below the Gangway on the Liberal
side. That showed his independence of the yoke of a Leader. Mrs.
BROWNE insisted upon his appropriating a corner seat, which he did on
the first night; hut he was so stared at, and became the object of so
many whispered observations, that he did not repeat the experiment.
A gentleman of genial manners, benevolent visage, and an ever-
ready smile (CHOLMONDELEY subsequently heard his name was Mr.
JOSEPH GILLIS), took a kindly interest in him.
"They won't let you sit there," said the Old Member. "But I '11
tell you what. If you only come early enough, you '11 find plenty of
room on the front bench by the table. Get the seat opposite the box,
and ye '11 be comfortable for the rest of the night."
CHOLMONDELEY thanked his friend, and thought the matter over.
But he observed, in the course of the evening, that when Mr. GLAD-
STONE was not in this particular place Sir WILLIAM HAHCOURT filled
it. He therefore retained his placo below the Gangway, sitting
wherever he could. When Mrs. BROWNE was in the Ladies' Gallery
(which often happened), he timidly put his feet up on the back of the
bench in front, which gave him an easy and assured attitude.
Being naturally a sharp man, he speedily grew accustomed to the
arrangements of the House, and only once voted in the wrong Lobby.
Members making that mistake, are accustomed to confess it at the
table of the House. But CHOLMONDELEY, as he said to Mrs. В., was
"not such a fool." He made believe that he meant to vote "No,"
and, as no one ever knew how a Liberal Imperialist was going to
vote, his defection on this occasion excited no comment.
He has not yet spoken, though he has prepared several speeches
and taken them down to the House. But, somehow, it does not seem
so easy to orate in the House of Commons as it did in the Town
Council. CHOLMONDELEY'S tongue cleaves to the roof of his month
when the moment provides opportunity for catching the SPEAKER'S
eye. His knees tremble, a cold sweat breaks forth on his massive
brow, the lights dance up and down before his eyes, and the SPEAKER
seems to be pirouetting round the Chair with the maoe. Urged on by
Mrs. В., who is sure he would make a great hit, CHOLMONDELEY once
liiil catoh the SPEAKER'S eye.
"Mr. CHOLMONDELEY BROWNE," the SPEAKER cried, as the New
Member half rose in his seat.
'' New Member! New Member !'' shouted six of the eight Members
present.
Here was CHOLMONDELEY'S chance. The remarkable phenomenon
already described took place, and he was speechless. But the SPEAKER
had called upon him and the House was waiting. Something must
be done, so the unhappy CHOLMONDELEY, half rising and turning
towards the locality where he recognbed the SPEAKER jumping about,
he said, "Sir, I beg your pardon, my Lord. It wasn t me."
CHOLMONDELEY had a bad time after this with Mrs. В.; but she has
not finally given him up. He will, she thinks, come out yet, take the
House by storm, and perhaps be made Home Secretary. In the mean-
time. CHOLMONDELEY is gaining increased ease, talks of " GLADSTONE"
and CHAMBERLAIN," and "RANDOLPH," and "HICKS-BEACH," in
an off-hand manner, as if he had known them all his life.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.
MB. PUNCH has rarely been more pained thanTon hearing that a lady, and
especially so charming a lady as Mrs. GENT- DA vis, had felt herself aggrieved by
a sharp sketch recently made in the course"of the aeries of "Studies" now
issuing from his Studio, to which, as it has already been'publiclv exhibited'for
two days, in* the" presence of,lthe LOKD MAYOB, at the Mansion House, further
reference in this place is unnecessary. Mr. Punch is delighted to be able to in-
form this lady — and her friends, including those-^ahem! — "good-natured
friends" - that she, personally, was not in that picture which came from
Mr. P.'s literary easel; and. a propos of pictures, he wishes her every success on
her next political canvass. By the way, at the Mansion House last Friday, Mr.
GENT-DAVIS, M.P., who is not a likely man to miss a chance of saying some-
thing happy when it occurs to him, lost a great opportunity of making a brilliant
jeu de mot. "Our" Mr. MONTAGU WILLIAMS asked him something or other, to
which Mr. GENT-DAVIS replied to the effect that he couldn't solve riddles. He
ought to have answered, "Davis sum, non Œdiput." But he didn't; and
Mr. Punch presents it to him, gratis, for use on nny future occasion, and so
bids both of them heartily farewell.
MR. PICKWICK'S JUBILEE.
MESSES. MACMILLAN as Publishers, and Mr. CHAKLES DICKENS — " The
Younger" — as Editor, are to be congratulated on their Jubilee Edition of Pick-
wick in two volumes. The illus-
trations are most interesting, and
give the work a real historical
value.
In addition to the editor's
preface, is an account written
by Mr. WALTER BESANT, of how
the celebrated Pickwick Exam-
ination at Christ's College, Cam-
bridge, was conducted by the
Junior Fellow, Mr. C. S. CAL-
VEHLEY, and how the prize was
won by the narrator, Mr. SKEAT
being a good second. The Exam-
ination Paper, a masterly tra-
vestie of the University degree
andlittle-gopapersof thatperiod,

»They come as a boon an. a b,essing to Men."
be genuine posers even kto those students who have not recently refreshed their
memories, by carefully perusing the book which, years ago, was to them as a
household word.
What will certainly strike the reader who undertakes the pleasant task of
going right through the book again in its present form, is the variety of
picturesque spots in town and country that the Pickwickians visited, and they
will probably wonder that not one question in Pickwickian Topography occurs in
Mr. CALVEBLEY'S examination paper. He could have framed several questions
calculated to test the accuracy and memory of the candidate, such for example
as (1) an inquiry into the peculiarities of tue ancient precincts of St. Clement's
Church, Ipswich, (2) of the Great White Horse in the same town, (3) of the route
to Ipswich, (4) a question as to the probable geographical position of Eatanswill,
(5) on what occasion Mr. Pickwick visited Dunchurch, Daventry, and Towcester,
(6) and at what hostelrie did Mr. Pickwick put up at Birmingham?
Mr. CHAKLES DICKENS has compiled guide-books, for home and abroad, for
river and road, he should now give us the Pickwickian Tourist's Guide. In
fact nothing but a set of coloured maps, indicating Mr. Pickwick's line of route
on various occasions, is wanting to complete this First Jubilee Edition, and
perhaps in the twentieth edition of this re-issue the maps may be added.
As for the sketches of Old London — "the remains" of which are fast dis-
appearing—they will have for all Londoners a peculiar charm. Looking at the
Sotnresque old places, Staple Tnn, Barnard's Inn, Furnival's Inn, where CHAKLES
ICKENS lived, and the ghostly corner in Clifford's Inn, as depicted in these pages,
we can only hope that the architecture of the future, will combine the beauty
of the past with the sanitary improvements of the present.
Yes, Mr. Pickwick is a We]come Guest at Christmas-time— the time so
specially dear to the great Novelist and Humorist — for Mr. Pickwick, gaiters
and all, is no stranger to any one of us, — though we shall never look upon his
like again, — and, he is immortal. Times change, manners and customs change,
modes of expression change, and modes of thought too, but Human Nature is
the one constant quantity, and grotesque and exaggerated as are some of the
types in Pickwick, yet the motives and the actions are human, the humour
throughout is unforced and irresistible, and the absurd complications in which
the principal characters found themselves involved, arise out of the most natural
and ordinary causes.
As a present, and particularly as a Christmas Present, for young and _old,
the Jubilee Edition of Pickwick will be very difficult to beat. Mr. Punch is of
opinion that it is the prize-book for the Jubilee Year.
"PHILOLOGICAL." — The attempts at solution are arriving in shoals. Our
Artist " С. К.," says he must draw the line somewhere, and he refuses to receive
any further correspondence after Saturday, Deo. 11, He has not yet determined
what the pri?e is to be.
ев' ¡WESTMINSTER AT S1LVERTOWN.
'THE Duke of "WESTMINSTER, with that kindness ai
good sense that always distinguishes him, took the ch«
at a public meeting at Silvertown, the other day, whii
was neld for the purpose of securing North Woolwii
Gardens as an open space for the recreation and enjo;
ment of the inhabitants of that cheerless and neglectx
locality. When a vote of thanks was proposed to hi
for presiding, it was said by the seconder of the pn
posai, a working man, that it was pleasant to a
Westminster coming so far East for the purpose i
doing a kind action; to which the Duke replied, wit
his usual quiet smile, that WESTMINSTER was very gli
indeed to come to Silvertown to help in a good cans
adding, that WESTMINSTEE would be pleased at any tint
to re-visit Silvertown, if Silvertown thought that sue
a visit would be of the slightest service either to the pla«
itself or to its hard-working inhabitante.
"Ah!" said one man, as the meeting broke up "if a
Docks was like this Dook, they 'd be a precious sigl
morepopular among us than they ever have been."
"Yes," replied his friend, "and to bring his beautift
wife with biin to show her that life wasn't all beer an
skittles, that 's what pleases me most of all."
"Ah! I should just like to know what she thought с
us all, and of our not very lovely surroundings, and о
the swarms of shouting kids. Why, it must have bee:
quite a revelation for her! And what a contrast to wha
she 's accustomed to, bless her beautiful face!"
Perhaps if the West occasionally visited the East whei
some good deed is to be accomplished, a better under
standing might result in a larger amount of sympathy
on the one hand, and of respect on the other.
ТЕЫ. IT то THE SUBMARINES.—THE new Submarim
Boat, of which experimental trial was made the othei
day in the Victoria Dock, seems from all accounts o:
the facility with which it immersed itself, certainly t(
have gone down well with the naval experts who wer«
present to witness its performance. Lord CHARLES
BEBESFOBD, who went on board and allowed himself tf.
be submerged in it, in seventeen leset of water, expressed
his approval of the little craft, which, apparently with a
view to a prospective look ahead at the mariue warfare oi
the future, is appropriately constructed on a telescopic
principle. Indeed the inveator, who manœuvred it at the
bottom of the dock, took, as the official occupant« of the
tiny cabin expressed it, "quite a rise " out of them, by
the/facility with which he again brought them to the
surface. On the whole the essay was peculiarly success-
ful, and if the Admiralty give orders tor the construction
of a number of similar craft, it is understood that, loi
divers obvious reasons, the cost will be defrayed from a
sinking fund.

ROBERT AT GILD HALL.
HAVING nothink partickler to do last Tuesday I strolled into the
butiful new Counsel Chamber at Qildhall, and seeing: a littel crowd
a going in at the front door, I went in with 'em and acshally enterd
its sacred presinks, when a most genelmanly yung man perlitely
arsked me whether I was a Princess Looweeaer or a Hupton Parker:
and wen I had recnvered myself enuff to say, not neether, he showed
me out and told me to go hup stares, and hupstares acordinly I went,
and then found out as the Princess Looweeser was the name of a
ome for ynng gals that wanted sum money, and the Hupton Parkers
wanted a new Church for their Park, witch I dessay the old ginerons
Copperation guv 'em right off the recl; as they allers does wenever
they 're arsked for any think. I sat up in the werry cumferal gallery
a lissening to the warious petitions for money, and was glad but not
surprised to see that wen a poor old Widder came how kindly they
guv her a seat and made her cumferal, and then sent her away smilin
and appy. Wot a Board of Gardians they wood make! Everybody
would get all he wanted and jest a lee tie more to surprise him.
After a time I was jest a thinking of going, when a gent got up
with a remarkable hi woioe, and asked another Gent, who it turned
out was a Cheerman, weather it was true as his Committee of 40 gents
was all a going for to have gold badges of 18 carrots gold, to cost
£4 10«. a peace, to wear when they hopened their new Skool of Music
nez week? The Cheerman like a reel gennelman as he is, said, why
suttenly, the same as you had when we gave a Ball to the Collindery
peeple. At which they all larf ed, me and all. Then sumbody else
arsked the Cheerman if all the Committee agreed to it, to which he
replied, Ко, there was some on 'em, he was ashamed to say, as ac-
shally wanted to have a beggarly honeyrareum that was ony to have
one carrot and ony to cost a ginny! But won of his Committee, who
was praps the reelest and most ginerous gent among 'em all, xclaimed
in a woice of thunder, "I woodn't touch it with a pare of Tongs!"
Ali, that 'в the man for my money. I was that delited that I ampet
called out " Name him!" but I fortnetly seed the City Marshall with
his soard in his skabbard close behind me, so I restrayned myself.
After that I am sorry to say that sumboddy acshally arsked for the
sacred book to be brort in, that contains all the most seeretest things
as ewer takes place behind the seens, and brort in it was, tho* I
could see as the young Oent as brort it in, amoet blushed as he did so.
Well, I hardly expecs to be believed when I save that the fine-
looking Town Clark, as I've seen afore on more festiv ocasions than
this, acshally read out with his fine tenner woice, so as ewery one of
us coud understand ewery word, such horful rewelashuns as, how
much a head they was to pay for their dinner, after the serrvmony
next Fursday, and how much it would be, supposing as they hadn't
not no wine. Ah, that wood be a nice chearful dinner that wood,
and all the toasts to be toast-and-water, I spose, as in the days of
my youthful infancy! Then that perfoundest of secrets was read
out, that the wine, if any was had, would cost jest as much as the
dinner! Wot a subjeck for the grinning Skoffer!
And, as if this wasn't enuff to brake the art of a real lover of his
Copperation, another Common Counsellor acshally anked the вате
plucky Chairman whether it was posserbel as he had sent out a
circular saying that refreshments consisting of Soops and Shampain
would be perwided from ГЗО to 2'30 pea. hem., for the Court of
Common Counsel only, and their Lady's. To which of course he
replied that it was quite true, and that he thort it was quite sufficient
for Lunch as they dined at 6, and he hoped his frend would injoy it
as he usually did, at which there was a good larf, in witch I coodn't
jine as I left the butiful Counsel Chamber with a sad hart to think
what a bio had bin struck that day at sum of the most cherisht
hinstitooshuns of our noble old City. ROBERT.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MEMOIRS OF A SECRET MISSION.
(Extracted from the Diary of Brio, M.P.)
ERE I am at Monaco. It
was not without gome
difficulty that I finally
arrangea an interview
with his Highness the
Prince. His territorial
estate is not extensive,
nor his revenues large
compared, for example,
with the income of
Messrs. GUINNESS. But
he is well aware of the
importance of his posi-
tion, and is not to be
lightly approached. I
learned very early after
I had put ш operation
the means by which I
finally secured an audi-
ence that the directors
of an evening news-
paper, published in
London, had repeatedly
endeavoured to inter-
view his Highness on
the current topics of the
day. They had always
been rebuffed, and per-
sistence from this
quarter had irritated the naturally equable temper of his Highness,
and caused him to double the sentries at the various approaches to the
palace. Having, however, decided to make an exception in my favour,
nothing could exceed the cordiality of my reception. As I passed
through the Courtyard, personally conducted by the Lord High
Chamberlain, the whole army of Monaco was drawn up in review order.
Of the rank and file, I never saw nine fitter looking fellows, whilst of
the officers, from the General downwards, it would be difficult to find
eleven gentlemen, better dressed, or gifted with such moustachios.
The Prince received me in the morninc-room, which commands a
fine view of the Mediterranean. Seated m the embrasured window
and looking South-East and West, the Prince beheld the scene of the
naval triumphs of his ancestors. It was my task to endeavour so to
impress his mind that the naval glories of Monaco should be revived
and the balance of power in Europe re-adjusted.
"Prince," I said after the civilities of greeting were accomplished,
"my communication will have prepared you for the nature of my
business. "We are, as you know, living in troubled times. Formerly
diplomatic communications were carried on through the humdrum
medium of Ambassadors. To-day we have changed 'all that. Mr.
SPENCER suddenly visits Berlin, and whilst a cunningly devised lay-
figure, with mechanical action for twirling its moustache, is placed
in a box at the theatre, and deludes two nations, Mr. SPENCEB ii
closeted at Varzin with the German Chancellor. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN,
scorning subterfuges, proceeds under his own name to the far East,
hobi and nobs with the SULTAN and confabulates with King of GBEKCE.
I may mention that I myself have seen the Dey of ALGIERS. What
passed between us, I may not at the moment disclose. Suffice it
that I have laid the foundations of an alliance with the English
Dissentient Unionists, that is likely to have momentous results in the
direction of European affairs. After leaving yonr Highness I pro-
ceed by appointment to Venice, where I shall have an interview with
the DOQE. Our glorious Chief in English is Mr. CHAPLIN. We are
strong in the affections and hearts of the people, but we find the
necessity of establishing powerful Continental alliances."
"Tee," said the Prince, who spoke with a slight accent, "I have
heard of your Mr. CHAPLINS. A great orator, and a man of posses-
sions, having three acres and a cow. He does not get on very well
with the Lord RANDOLPH so I hear, from my secret emissary in the
court of St. James's."
"Then your Highness keeps yourself informed of the state of
affairs in the various Capitals?"
"In the Capitals!" cried the Prince contemptuously, shrugging
his shoulders. "What shall I say ?_ Look there !" and he pointed to
rows of strongly bound volumes, rising shelf upon shelf from floor to
ceiling, completely occupying one end of the room,
"Those are the reports of the last ten years, received from my
secret emissaries in all yonr large towns. The drift of opinion in the
Capitals! Mon dieu, I know the drift of feeling in every one of your
Town Councils. Some of them I move with my little finger."
"Ah, I have thought that their proceedings were occasionally
inscrutable."
"But your CHAPLINS, if I agree to work with yon in conjunction
with their Imperial Highnesses, the Dey of ALGIEHS and the Doge of
VENICE, he will doubtless, when he pleases, throw me over. He will
form the alliance with the Irish Members. Ha! ha! I know all
about your JOSEPH 0ILI.ISKS and your Тш НКАТ.ПВ."
I was amazed at His Highness's intimate acquaintance with the
minuti«! of our political affaire, but I am, I trust, too well versed in
diplomacy to betray surprise.
"It seems to me," the.Prince continued, "that you are a little too
much sub-divided in your political parties in England. In Monaco
there is but one party, C'est Mot." ("And a nice young party you
are, if all we hear of you is true," I said—but not aloud.) 7l Can any
man count up the divisions of your parties? There used to be Whig»
and Tories. But what have yon now, with your Unionists, and
Dissentient Liberals, your Gladstonians, your Randolphians, and
your Chamberlings. If I were to decide to back up England with my
alliance, whom should I be making a bargain with?"
"We are the Coming Party, your Highness, we the Chaplinitei.
The rest are but names or symbols. The heart of the people beats in
unison with us. All we want to consolidate our power ana assure our
position is a fret-work of Continental alliances. Other parties turn
first to BisstABCE. If they find he is engaged on the other side, they
tamper with Russia or dally with Austria, or fiddle to France. We
want you to be our HISMAKCK."
The Prince was evidently touched with this eloquent outburst. He
walked up and down the room several times with his hands clasped
behind his back. What thoughts chased through his brains ! _what
considerations was he revolving! With what momentous issues
were these few minutes pregnant.
"There is something in what you eay." he almost whispered. "I
have long had my eye on К ISM MICK. Partly, I fear, through in-
dolence of nature, I have left him alone till he has swollen himself
out like the frog in the fable. But let him beware! By the blood of
my ancestors, when Monaco speaks Berlin would do well to be mute."
This looked promising. I had evidently gone on the right tack,
and by stirring up the smouldering ashes of ambition, was winning
over to our cause this mighty potentate.
"Is RANDOLPH with you?" he asked, still harping on the idea of
fatal diversity of action on the part of my country.
"No," I said boldly, "RANDOLPH is not with us. CHAPLIN haa
been most patient and considerate. Anxious only for the interests of
the country, he has allowed RANDOLPH to flout him in public,
declaring himself content with apologies subsequently offered in
private. But he has now finally broken with him, started a party of
his own, and RANDOLPH'S destruction is but a matter of days or
weeks."
"And what do you propose, as'Ithe bases of our alliance?" the
Prince asked after another pause.
"Well, in the first place, we shall make Russia sit up. CHAPLIN
never has had much of an opinion of Russia. Same of his most
stirring orations in the House of Commons, have been directed
against the CZAR. I think, with your assistance, we could drive
Russia out of Central Asia. Your Highness might have Central
Asia if we can pacify the Doge of VENICE in another quarter."
"I own," said the Prince, "that the prospect of annexing Central
Asia, attracts me. But what do you want for yourself?"
"Nothing, Prince," I answered, proudly. "England's sole desire
is for the welfare and peace of mankind. Possibly we miirht take
Egypt and hurry the Germans out of any inconvenient contiguity to
our Colonies. But our watchword is Peace, and—perhaps I may add
-Plenty."
"How did you find ALGIERS? Does he seem of a grasping
nature?"
"No, I think if we gave him back Spain, he would want no Moor."
"Well, that of course could be easily managed," said the Prince.
"Of course there would be no stipulation against my establishing at
Merv or Khiva a replica of Monte Carlo, if 1 thought it would take?"
"Not at all, not at all. I fancy such an institution would be
highly popular, and would tend to solder the relations between yonr
people and your Highness."
"And what do you propose to give the DOGE?"
"Ireland. I fancy that will quiet him. He has always been
accustomed to a watery prospect, and it frequently rains in Ireland."
Your plan commends itself to me. Still, I am haunted by doubt as
to whether I can reasonably and safely depend upon your party.
What about the Markiss? Is he with yon, or against you?"
"Oh, the Markise he's nobody. RANDOLPH'S subdued him, and
CHAPLIN is RANDOLPH'S master."
"Then GLADSTONE?"
"GLADSTONE 's played out. CHAPLIN says so. In fact¡ he said so
twelve years ago. Besides, if he were to rouse himself into a flash
of energy, you might safely leave The CHAPLIN to manage him."
"Bien! I think we may come to terms, and ВЮМАВСК will find
that he does not, as he has been taught to believe, hold the fate of
Europe in the hollow of his hand. There is a Prince at Varzin, and
a Prince at Monaco. But leave me now. I would like to think
things over. We shall meet again. Au revoir!"

IN THE COURT OF COMMON SENSE.
(Before Mr. Justice Punch, without a Jury. )
lie The River Thames Steamboat Company.—This matter was
mentioned to his Lordship, who on ordering it to stand over observed,
"It seems to me that this property
should not be allowed to waste away.
No doubt, at present, those whose
duty it is to protect the shareholders,
have a very difficult task before them.
However, I have looked at the last
balance-sheet, and find that the Com-
pany is being worked at a profit. It
seems strange that a means of con-
veyance extremely popular and lucra-
tive in Paris, and most of our own
large riverside towns, should earn so
little in London. Before the matter is
again discussed, I hope very earnestly
that the Managers will carefully con-
sider the position of the Company and
do their utmost by improving the
boats and reforming much that re-
quires alteration to turn the Association into the road leading to
perfect success."
In the Matter of Certain Newspapers.—This was an application to
restrain the publication of some proceedings in the Probate, Divorce
and Admiralty Division which were declared to be unfit for perusal.
In refusing to make the order, Mr. Justice PUNCH said :—" The
remedy may be worse than the disease. Some of the matter brought
before me is certainly most unedifying, 'still, I am very reluctant to
interfere with the liberty of the Press. The supply is created by the
demand, and a newspaper proprietor can scarcely be blamed for fol-
lowing the lead of his contemporaries. I may aoid that the results of
cases beard in camera are frequently the reverse of satisfactory. I
feel that, kept within proper bounds, the publicity of the Press is
most wholesome."
The Christmas Vacation.—Mr. Justice Ротгсн gave notice that
when the Court rose at the end of Michaelmas Term, he would still
sit in his own chambers (85, Fleet Street) on Wednesdays. The early
meeting of Parliament is believed to have been the cause of this
announcement.

OUR ADVERTISERS.—PERSONAL.
THE GREAT SECRET OF SUCCESS IN LIFE,
though pursued by few and achieved by many, is not, however, to
be found in figuring in the Bankruptcy Court, starting a Provincial
Circus without sufficient means, or getting brought up before a
Police Magistrate and fined for being drunk and incapable, nor is
the pertinent question of
WHAT MAKES A HAPPY CHRISTMAS?
satisfactorily answered by spending it in giving a trial in turns to
all the advertised Patent Medicines—still it must have occurred to
many who, at this festive season, owing to an over-indulgence in the
good things of the table, have seen the cheerful smile banished from
the midst of their family circle to give place to a profound and over-
whelming melancholy, to ask themselves in the language used by
THE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA,
whether, if they did not mind spending Threepence between them,
he and
GENERAL KAULBAR3, THE HERO OF BULGARIA,
could not manage to secure a hearty laugh for the outlay. Not that
they would be reckless as to the direction in which they turned to
expend the stipulated sum, which they certainly would, under no
consideration whatever, devote to any agitation calculated to em-
barrass Her Majesty's Ministers in their elephantine and portentous
efforts to display shortly to the world
A HAPPY AND CONTENTED IRELAND.
Nor will they—bearing continually in mind the truth of the whole-
gome adage that
THE ART OF CONQUEST IS LOST WITHOUT THE ART OF
LAUGHING—
be likely to invest it in any of the shares of the numerous Gold
Mining Companies that are just now largely absorbing the spare cash
of a confiding and expectant public. But, determined to have their
full threepennyworth of fun for their money, they will, without
troubling
GENERAL ROBERTS IN BURMAH,
and interrupting- his operations, and also without going through the
process of drawing
A FURTHER CHEQUE ON THE BANK OF LIFE,
manage to combat the dire effects of indigestion, dissipate gloom,
and surround with a halo of boisterous mirth and merriment the
dejected and downcast spirits who ever follow in the wake of Christ-
mas festivity, by going straight to 85, Fleet Street, and there pur-
chasing the great and unique antidote to all doleful and dismal
habits of mind, in the shape of that hearty mental refresher and re-
invigorator known as

LIMITED PROSPECTS.
Latest—from Our Own City Commissioner.
THE prevalent mania for floating every concern in the shape of a
Limited Company shows no signs of abatement, the most recent
development of the movement resulting in the issue of ,the subjoined
promising prospectuses which speak for themselves :—
THE AMALGAMATED BAKED POTATO-CAN AND ROAST-
CHESTNUT COMPANY (LIMITED).
Directors.
JOHN MUGGINS. Mile End Road*( Chairman).
JAMES SNOOKS. Rotherhithe.
WILLIAM SIXES. Elizabeth Street, Seven Dials.
With power to add to their number.
PBOSPECTUS.
THE Company has been formed for the purpose of acquiring as a
going concern, and for extending the Baked Potato business recently
conducted with great financial success by Mr. JOHN MUGGINS, as also
that of the Roast Chestnut interest for many years carried on at a
substantial profit by Mr. JAMES SNOOKS, who received the property
from his late father Mr. JERRY SNOOKS, who had already realised a
large fortune out of it.
The vendors not having kept any books of their respected
businesses, they have no figures to submit to the scrutiny of any
firm of chartered accountants, but when they state that the proceeds
of their united enterprise has produced during the last month and a
half a weekly turnover of £2 13s. Grf., the valuable character of the
property now offered to the consideration of inquiring investors is at
once apparent.
The Directors, therefore, in making their first call for £3,000 of
the Company's capital, which thev propose to raise by an issue of £1
shares, of which 9d. will be payable on application, 1«. 3d. on allot-
ment, and the balance at uncertain intervals, as circumstances may
require, beg to point out to the investing public that this sum will
secure from the proprietors the stock-in-trade, good-will, and plant,
the latter comprising a finished apparatus, with steam-jet and
pepper ¿and salt box complete, for the peripatetic baking of potatoes,
and also a perforated brazier, in fair condition, for the sale and
display of roasted chestnuts.
It is calculated that, by the energetic action of the vendors, who
have consented for the first fifteea years to act on the Board of
direction, that a very extensive connection, already established, may
be indefinitely enlarged, and that, with fair success, a very hand-
some dividend will be forthcoming for payment to the share-
holders.—Early application is invited.
THE IMPERIAL WHELK AND SAUCER FISH COMPANY
(LIMITED).
THE Directors of this thoroughly sound and promising concern
have just issued their preliminary Prospectus. In it they state that
they have made arrangements to purchase on advantageous terms
the movable barrow, stock of fish, vinegar, appropriate china-ware,
and all the necessary apparatus for the sale of that much-estimated
and high-class East-End fish, the whelk, and its kindred species, of
Mr. BILL WAITINGS, who has for many years been noted as the
proprietor of the leading stall devoted to the supply of this class of
edible refreshment in the neighbourhood of the New Cut.
Mr. BILL WAPPINGS, who will receive half the pnrchase-monev in
fully paid-up Shares, has consented to join the Board after allot-
ment, and give it the benefit of his valuable assistance and advice.
THE CROSSING-SWEEPERS' CORPORATION (LIMITED).
ABRIDGED PEOSPECTÜS.
Capital, £500,000.
THIS Company has been formed for the purpose of securing the
whole of the crossing-sweeping interest of the Metropolis under one
head, thereby insuring a monopoly of this well-recognised most
lucrative industry. There being hardly anv limit te the number of
posts from which substantial incomes could be derived, the Directors

calculate that by charging a small premium in each case for the
letting of the same to impecunious members of the Upper Middle
Classes, notably to briefless members of the Junior Bar, unappre-
ciated Artists, and unemployed Literary Men, they could counl
safely on the realisation, from this source, of a handsome dividend
to the Shareholders.
A further and fuller Prospectus, to which will be appended a list
of the Directors, who will comprise several noted Sweepers at the

early application for Shares is invited.
THE WEST-END METROPOLITAN TRIPE AND ONION
TRADING COMPANY (LIMITED).
THE above has just been eet on foot for the purpose of dealing
largely in the supply to the more fashionable quarters of the
Metropolis of this highly popular East-End relish, and as a pre-
liminary step the premises of Messrs. SMITH AND SON, the noted
dealers of Watling Street, Commercial Road, E., together with the
goodwill, plant and general stock-in-trade, have already been
secured for a nominal sum. The Directors being confident that it
only needs an acquaintance with this delicate dish to make it the
rage at every dinner-table inBelgravia, do not hesitate to recommend
the investment to shareholders anxious to secure a speedy and hand-
some dividend for their money.
The Share list will remain open for eighteen months.
OUT OP WATER AT THE ROYAL AQUARIUM.
(Being tome Account of the great Potato Tercentenary.)
Mr »BAB Ma. PUNCH,
IT was with feelings of the liveliest satisfaction that
received your commands to "do" the Potato Tercentenary Exhi-
bition at the St. Stephen's Hall, Westminster, as I felt it was an
occasion of the greatest national importance. When I got to my
destination I found that the Managers, in anticipation of the ex-
pected rush of Visitors, had placed on the long tables laid out with
samples of Potatoes, placards requesting enthusiasts to keep to one
side to prevent overcrowding. Praiseworthy as this precaution
undoubtedly was, I am not quite sure that it was necessary, as I do
not think there were half-a-dozen persons present actually inspecting
the vegetables. I also noticed a little group of people seated on chairs
in front of some diagrams.
At first Ithonghtthis group was a family party waitingforsome light
refreshment (there was a very good luncheon-bar in the Hall), but
on nearer inspection, to my intense surprise discovered that it was an
important public meeting. There was a Chairman with about eight
supporters ^1 made the ninth), and in the background were two or three
representatives of the Press. A gentleman was standing in front of
some diagrams (which I thought, before I had had the advantage of an
explanation, were clever studies of pickled cabbage) talking rapidly
in an undertone. At first I imagined that he was explaining confi-
dentially some personal grievance—possibly that his train had been
forty minutes late, or perhaps that his dog had been seized by the
police because it had no muzzle—until, on receiving his walking-
stick and beginning to point with it, I felt convinced that he must
be delivering a lecture. I was entirely right. He was kind enough
to raise his voice a little, and then 1 learned that he was saying
something or other about the potato disease. The sketches I found
had nothing to do with pickled cabbage, but represented magnified
fungus. It appeared, from the gentleman's statement, that this
noxious growth was fatal to the favourite food of Irishmen, and was
in the habit of reaching its full dimensions in two or three hours.
He seemed to despair of finding a remedy, and laughed to scorn a sug-
gestion which I understood had been made by a Dublin Professor, that
the potato disease should be put down by Act of Parliament.
Just as I was getting deeply interested, the Lecturer suddenly
ceased speaking, and sat down abruptly. Upon this, a learned
gentleman stood up, and called upon another of our little group to
address " the meeting." I fancy that the new speaker was a noble-
man who had given up his life to potatoes. That was the impres-
sion he left on my mind after he had been talking for a couple of
minutes. I also gathered, from his rather vagne remarks, that he
had nothing much to say because he had not the remotest notion,
before entering the hall,'that he would be called upon for a speech,
and further, that, had he known that an oration would be expected
from him, his suggestions would not be of much value, as he was not
particularly well up in his subject. This being the case, he con-
tented himself with contradicting, in a gentlemanly and genial
way, much of what the Lecturer had advanced, and sat down. Upon
this the Chairman again rose, and called for a speech. He looked
round, and appealed to.one gentleman by name to say something, but
without effect.

THE EVENING PIPERS.
"'ERE Y'AKE, bliss! HOEFUL REVELATIONS 1"
After a pause, a lady rose to her feet, and made an earnest appeal
to those present to advertise the next Tercentenary Exhibition in
the Welsh papers. This suggestion was very favourably received,
Csibly because the responsibility of carrying it out (at three
idred years' date) did not appear to be overwhelming. After the
fair advocate of the rights of "poor little Wales" had had her say,
there was another pause, and a second appeal for speakers. It
brought up a foreigner, whose address, I must confess, I did not
understand, because it was spoken in rather imperfect English;
however, no doubt it was admirable. As the original Lecturer now
showed signs of," going in for a second innings," I thought it a con-
venient moment to tear myself away from the delightful little
gathering, to visit the Cookery and Food Exhibition in the adjoin-
ing Aquarium. As I left the St. Stephen's Hall, I was grieved to
find that not a person was inspecting the tables with their burdens
of potatoes, and that consequently the placards regulating the traffic
were still superfluous.
On reaching the Aquarium I found the Variety Entertainment
on" and " Cookery and Food," chiefly represented by sweetstnff-
italls, a tobacco-store, and several agencies for condensed meat.
Strange as it may appear, I preferred the feats of some talented
jentlemen in evening dress who were amusing themselves by jump-
ing upon one another's heads on the stage to the " exhibits." I was
on the point of looking carefully at some milk when my attention was
attracted by a lady crossing a very high tight-rope on a bicycle. I
should certainly have carried my investigation further, had not a
jugle-call summoned me to see Professor BECKWITH'S Swimming
Entertainment in the tank. As one who is passionately devoted to
jptatoes, and equally fond of food and cooking. I must say that I con-
sidered the feats of Mr. WILLIAM BECKWITH, his sister, and a young
iemale member of the family, most marvellous and pleasing. In the
lame character (I beg to put it on record that the Potato Tercen-
,pn:iry has my warmest sympathy) I must admit that I was delighted
¡nth the grace and good-nature of Professor.BECKWITH'S lady pupil.
In fact one of the most gratifying features of the present attempts to
glorify the national food of Ireland, and to advance the cause of good
cocking at the Royal Aquarium, is to be found (in my humble
opinion) in Professor BECKWITH'S entertainment. That at any rate
went swimmingly. Yours figuratively, A HOT POTATO.

A VISION OF OLYMPUS.
AS POSTPRANDIALLY PRESENTED TO MB. J-SSE C-LL-NGS.
Он, Mount Olympus,
Superbly souring
Betwixt the Ionian
And .Жогеап Seas,
Decked by the amaranth
That spontaneous grows there,
In sweet disorder,
'Neath unfading trees!
There, grandly gracing
The verdant landscape,
Are the gods and goddesses,
And nymphs so fair;
Jove, Venus, Apollo,
And a lot to follow,
All lounging—lightly
In the open air.
With gentle JOSEPH
We went for scaling,
Like the warring Titans,
Thy tremendous top;
Though it wasn't thunderbolts,
But—well, lack of bellows
That caused us fellows
Half-way to stop.
Thick clouds surround it,
As in HOMER'S period,
And of Aphrodite
We caught no gleam,
But after dinner
I got forty-wink ing,
And beheld the following
In a sort of dream.
• * *
Mercury met us,
As we strove to enter
The immortal circle,
With respectful tread;
(His visage somehow
Seemed most familiar)
There was Jupiter lounging
On an amaranth bed.

"Mr. CHAMBKKLAIN and hie party have been vieiting Olympus."—Daily Paper.
(Am—" The Orares of Blarney.")
There was Lady Venus
Matched with whom, between us,
(Our TERRYS and LANGTRYS,
Are the smallest beer),
There was stately Juno,
And she ogled JOSEPH
In a frisky fashion.
Which I thought queer,
In these classic regions,
As upon the Bosphorns,
Or in British Birmingham,
JOB is quite a lion;
And he's so adventurous
That it struck me, somehow,
Juno might be thinking
Of her friend Ixion.
(You '11 have read that story
In the works of DIZZY)
JOE is most ambitious,
And he 's keen and proud.
High stakes he 's playing,
And I do hope, bless him!
The goddess he 's wooing
Won't prove a cloud.
Well. Mercury led us
Into Jove's high presence,1
And JOSEPH nodded
Whilst I "loutcdlow,"
Venus smiled so sweetly
I could not help thinking
It 's a good thing really
JOSEPH'S name is JOE,
When, on a sudden,
I perceived Jove's visage
To Lord SALISBURY'S countenance
Change at a stroke,
Whilst the herald, Mercury,
Was just Lord RANDOLPH,
Which thing so shocked me
I—in fact awoke!
TURNING OVER NEW LEAVES.
(By our <nen Paper-knifer.)
"WE were flogged at school," wrote THACKERAY in a delightful
article in the Quarterly, "we were fifty boys in our boarding-house,
and had to wash in a leaden trough, under a cistern, with lumps of
fat yellow soap floating about in the ice and water. Are our sons
ever flogged? Have they not dressing-rooms, hair-oil, hip-bathe
and Baaen-towels 'f And what picture-books the young villains
have 1 What have these children done that they should be so much
happier than we were?" As Christmas-time approaches these words
often recur to Mr, Punch, and he wonders what the children of the
present day have done that the publishers should now bow down and
worship them, that the smartest writers should offer them their best
work, and that the most accomplished artists should wield the pencil
for their delectation. What a wealth, what a variety of children's-
books come pouring in at this season of the year! Here we have Mr.
GEORGE HENTY—the Boy's Own Author—with his capital story The
Young Carthaginian, and his stirring- tale of Bush life in Australia,
called A Final Reckoning—the first illustrated by Mr. STANILAND,
the second by Mr. WOLLE». We have also a good sea-story by Mr.
J. C. HUTCHESON, The White Sauall—nothing to cry about—with
pictures by Mr. SCHONBEHG, The Eversley Secrets, told bv Mrs.
GREEN (and probably "let out" by the Libraries), and Our Frank,
by Mies WALTON. These all come from Messrs. BLACKIE AND SON.
Messrs. 1 lonnmt AJTD STOUGHTON publish some delightful volumes:
it would be odd if they didn't, and it wouldn't be Hodder at all
events. Among them may be especially noted Charlie Lücken at
School and College, by the Rev. H. C. ADAMS; A Flood that Led
on to Fortune, by OLD BOOMERANG ; Some of Our Fellows, by the Rev.
T. S. MILLINGTON; Thrilling Tales, by Dr. MACAULAY; In the Fort,
by Miss SARAH TYTLER, ana When we were Girls Together, by Miss
SARAH DOUBNEY. Messrs. CASSELL cater charmingly for girls in
A World of Girls, by Miss MEADE—sunshiny, flowery Meade—•
illustrated by Miss EDWARDS. They also show the irrepressible boy
is by no means forgotten in Through Trial to Triumph, by Miss
HUNT; Freedom's Sword by Miss SWAN, a little Duck, of course,
and The Tales of the Sixty Mandarins, by RAMASWAMI RAJTT.
Among other attractive volumes which will be eagerly perused, are
Hear and Forbear, by Miss SARAH PITT—a title suggestive of the
Zoological Gardens and the Refreshment Stall, but nothing to do
with it: Frank's Life Sattle, by Mr. REDFORD; Rhoda's Reward,
by Miss EMMA MARSHALL; and Foremost if I Can, by Miss ATTER-
IDGE. Mr. FISHER UNWDT has issued a delightful story, written
and illustrated by Miss FLORENCE and Miss EDITH SCANNELL, called
The Time of Roses, also a fairy-folk story-book called Prince Peer-
less, which cannot fail to be popular among children. It is written
by the Hon. MARGARET COLLIER, and illustrated by her brother, the
Hon. JOHN COLLIER. The two Colliers ought to bring out a new
illustrated edition of Old King Coal. Boys will find a world of
delight in Boys' Own Stories, written by their old favourite Mr.
ASCOTT R. HOPE. One of Hope's many "flattering tales."
Leaving the children for awhile, we turn to Our Temperaments
(CROSBY, LOCKWOOD & Co.). Our temperaments are often more
various, and far more difficult to manage, than pur children. It is a
big book, but it is a big subject. The volume is heavy to hold, but
light to read. Though Mr. ALEXANDER STEWART has treated his
subject exhaustively, he writes, at the same time in a popular and
pleasant manner that renders it attractive to the general reader.
"Temperament" has long been the apology for all kinds of bad
behaviour; it has been the excuse for every species of rudeness, of
idleness, and incapacity. Many people have assumed special tem-
peraments, though they have them not. Now, by the aid of this
excellent guide it is possible to find out all about them; we shall be
able to strip off the mask of false temperament, and put them all in
their proper places. What a shuffling of the pack of social cards
there will be if people only read this volume carefully, and are able
to carry out its precepts! So much is penned concerning Society in
the present day, and what constitutes it, that it is somewhat a
relief to turn from the twaddle written thereanent, to a volume
called Society in the Elizabethan Age (SwAN, SONNENSCHEIN & Co.).
In this Mr. HUBERT HALL gives a very fair picture of all classes of
society of that period—how they lived, what they did, and what they
spent. The volume contains some very curious illustrations and
interesting statistics. Vastly entertaining is the account of "Wild
Darrell's Diet " just three hundred years ago—especially if we con-
trast it with the hotel bills of the present day.

STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH'S STUDIO.
No. Til.—THE
THE superficial are too
apt to imagine that, to
be a Dancing-Master,
it is only requisite to
dance. This is error;
for the Master might
dance all day, and su-
perbly, in the presence
of a pupil—and though
that pupil be as imita-
tive and intelligent af
the monkey, he would
yet find himself unable
to reproduce the per-
formance in his own
person with any accu-
racy of detail.
The man who suc-
ceeds best in imparting
the weird mysteries oj
this most difficult Art,
must be peculiarly
adapted for his human-
ising mission.
He should possess the
dignity, without the
hauteur, of the gentle-
man who hands the
chairs in a Drapery
Establishment conducted on Cash-Payment principles; in his
powers of conversation he must distance the chattiest conceivable
dentist; he ought to display at least as much tact in preserving
the remains of his client's self-respect as is exhibited by the Sub-
urban Photographer. He must be musioianly as OBPHEUS, persuasive
as NESTOR, lucid as EUCLID; while he should possess, at the same
time, an acquaintance with the first principles of elementary eti-
quette only second to that of the "Member of the Aristocracy"
who instructs the middle classes how to behave in polite society.
All these are no trifling qualifications; and each one who dreams
of embracing this arduous profession should look first into his own
bosom, and ask himself seriously whether he finds them there or not.
The ideal Dancing-Master must have infinite patience, and it is
better if he is not bandy-legged. Even a touch of gout has, ere this,
detracted fatally from the effect of many a well-conceived and con-
scientiously-executed illustration.
But let us now proceed to consider the Dancing-Master from a
somewhat less abstract point of view; and we shall best attain this
end if we follow the steps of one who has, after much internal
searching, decided to sit. so to speak, at the feet of one of these
saltatory sages. We will suppose, then, that the intending disciple,
with a beating heart and the implements of study (which can be
procured at any bootmaker's) carried with him in a small hand-bag,
presents himself at the address which may have met his eye in an
advertisement column. He will find the interior of a subdued and
even ascetic appearance, eminently calculated to counteract the levity
of the accomplishment which is imparted therein.
The exercise of Dancing has been denounced as unduly frivolous,
but the aspect of any one of its Professors is in itself a sufficient
answer to this charge. The veriest bigot must admit that upon their
brows is set the seal of solemnity.
A youth, whose veracity Mr. Punch has no" reason whatever to
doubt, assures him that he knows no pastime more innocent, more
devoid of all voluptuousness, than a waltz with his Dancing-Master;
nor, in the opinion of the same authority, is the polka with the lady
of mature years (who attends to instil that self-confidence that comes
only with practice) a dissipation the memory of which is likely to
disturb, appreciably, the serenity of one's closing years.
But the Dancing-Master has generally an even graver pursuit to
which he flies for solace. Sometimes it is Archœology, and then yon
will see displayed on the table where he writes his receipts, a little
monograph on the Roman Remains at a watering-place where he
once spent a fortnight.
Or else it is Entomology, in which case you will find on the walls
a valuable and complete collection of all the varieties of the Cabbage
Butterfly found in Middlesex; or it is General Research, and he
presents you with his Essay On the Ladies' Chain, as known to the
Ancients, and handed down in Greek and Assyrian Sculpture, with
a Theory upon the Aztec Origin of the Highland Schottische, and
a brief Comparison between the Sailor's Hornpipe and the Austra-
lian Corroborée, with some Notes on Serpent Dancing.
He will certainly be so far literary as to own the Authorship of
The Dancing-Man's Vade-Месит for the current year, price one
shilling, with diagrams, and all the most recent discoveries. To
resume: the Student passes, then, from the reception-parlour '.to
the class-room, where 'he will await his instructions in as docile a
frame of mind as possible.
The Professor begins by initiating him into a series of apparently
unconnected motions, which he is given to understand represent the
several sections of the trois temps walte—though only the eye of
faith can perceive, under these dry and dissected forms, the rhythmic
grace which will one day characterise their successful combination.
Still the Dancing-Master exhorts him to persevere, to preserve a
due sequence in these mystic evolutions, and even at last to compli-
cate them with a rotary mode of progress. And with this object,
the student labours diligently, though, if he be wise, he will avoid
consulting his reflection in the large mirror he will probably observe
on the wall—lest he lose heart, and shaking off his pumps at the
threshold, cross it no more.
After an hour employed in solitary revolution, like a planet, me
pupil will emerge—giddy perhaps, but far from gay, and inclined to
contradict those who consider dancing fraught with any perilous
degree of fascination.
On his next appearance, however, more flowers are strewn in his
path; the Dancing-Master even "laps him in soft Lydian airs"
upon his violin, as the pupil circles, still in solitude, to the tune
of some fossil Bird Waltz, and likens himself with some bitterness
unto a performing bear.
However, he feels that without this ordeal, he cannot hope to
arrive at that proficiency in a ball-room, for want of which even a
Narcissus would be but a flower upon the wall. And in process of
time, with a pride at which none but cynics would sneer, the neo-
phyte finds himself promoted to dance, for spaces of five minutes toge-
ther, with a hotiri who is apparently oneof the Dancing-Master's Aunts!
Then follow happier hoiirs, in which he revolves perpetually with
alternate and uncomplaining Aunts, until he is pronounced efficient,
to the extent of joining his preceptor's next weekly "soirée,"
"réunion, "or "assembly," as he styles it indifferently.
There he has the actual thing, or at least a very passable imitation
of it; real young ladies to practise with, some even pretty, and it is
from these last that he will probably in his newborn confidence,
select a companion with whom to stagger round the room.
Should the Dancing-Master, who is seen on these occasions in all
his majesty, take a genuine interest in his latest pupil, he will dance
after him, alone, in the immediate rear, in order to observe and
criticise his paces, which he does audibly enough to stamp their
author as an unmistakeable beginner, whereupon the pupil, to his
infinite confusion, discovers that his feet have lost their cunning, and
dance an arbitrary selection of steps which are but feeble phantasms
of those he had mastered with so much protracted agony. Then,
perhaps, it is that he seeks his guide, confesses his backsliding,
asking piteously for explanation and counsel. And the Dancing-
Master, rather pained man surprised, recommends assiduous prac-
tice before a looking-glass in spare moments, and hints that an even
surer safeguard against, any future stumbling may be found in pro-
longing the period of instruction.
"WHAT WAS YOU PLEASED TO HOBSERVE?"
LAST Sunday the placid Observer,—oddly enough in this Christian
country the only public Observer of Sunday,—in the course of some
observations on a recent case, spoke in an unwarrantably familiar
manner of Mr. Punch as "Punch." The Observer is bound to
observe the rules of etiquette, and should no more venture to speak
of Mr. Punch as " Punch," than of H.R.H. the Prince of WAUSS as
"WALES." Of course Mr. Punch, like good-natured Mr. Pick-
wick, when Aim Weller drew his attention to somebody's having
inscribed "Pickwick" on the coach door, and having added insult to
injury bv putting "Moses afore it," can afford to emile at such a
breach of good manners, and can reply " Certainly not" to the in-
quiry of anyone of his faithful followers who might wish to know,
with Sam Weller, "Ain't nobodv to be whopped for takin' this
here liberty?" And as Mr. Weiler's subsequent conjecture as to
the effect of that 'ere trial" on his master's spirit was utterly erro-
neous, so would be any similar deduction with regard to Mr. Punch.
He passes over, too, the hackneyed illustration of the "butterfly,"
and the gratuitous suggestion of the "gnat," merely remarking that
Mr. Punch knows he is always "natty," and to be likened to a
"butterfly" might have been, in days gone by, a compliment from
Grub Street, with which typically Bohemian locality, existing now
only in name, the respectable Observer of Sunday in London would
not like, naturally enough, to be associated.
GRAITD LODGERS.—AT a special meeting of the Grand Lodge of
Ireland, held the other day in Dublin, the Earl of EBNE was unani-
mously elected as Imperial Grand Master of the Orange Institution.
This appointment sounds all right, but it can scarcely be denied
that association with an Erne is rather suggestive of dragging the
Institution (absit omen.') into hot water.

ROBERT ON CHEAP COALS.
I WAS a setting at home the other day a smokin of my pipe and a
reedin of a hapenny paper, witch I allers buys ewery day, fust
beooz its cheapest, and second becoz I reeds things there as I never
finds in no other papers, wen
"^- there cum a lowd knock at
the door, and I calls out cum
in, and he cnms in, and seeing
him with a lot of papers an
a hinkstand at his button-ole,
I natrally takes him for a
Tacks-gatherer, and as nat-
rally calls out, "Hollo, wot
anotherone!" Wen he smiles
gently, and sez, sez he, "No.
Mr. ROBERT, I have called
this time to be of sum service
to you." Of coarse this most
minuterai speech put me on
my card, so I pulls myself together and I lissens.
Well, he goes on to arsk me, if I should like to have my Coles jest
a bit cheaper P To witch I natrally ansers, "Why, suttenly." He
then sez, "Then jest sine this petition to Parlymint, and the thing's
dun." So he dips a pen into his privet hinkstand and holds it out to
me backards. So I sez, sez I, "It ain't werry ofien as I 'm arsked to
sine my name, and afore I does it, I likes to know what it 's all about."
"Quite rite, Mr. ROBEBT," sez he; "so I'11 tell yer. The hold
Copperashun," sez he
"I nose it werry well," sez I.
"Has been putting a tacks on our Coles for ever so long, and wants
to keep on doing it, so we are a going to arsk Parlyment to stop it."
"How much is it?" sez I.
"Thirteen-pence a tun," sez he.
"I 'm not much of a skollard," sez I, "at figgers, and allus buys
my Coles by the Sak. How much will it save me in a Sak?"
"Nearly three-hapence," sez he.
"Well, that 's summat," sez I, "in these ard times, but not werry
much. But jest tell me what the old Copperashun does with the
money; for if they spends it in splendid Bankwets, and Balls, and
setterer, you 've jest come to the rong shop to get any hobjections to
that rite nobel way of spending lots of money.
"Oh, no, Mr. ROBEBT," sez he, "nothink of the sort. Why, they
acshally spends ewery penny of it in buying up lots of feelds. and
forrests, and parks, and places, for growed-up peeple to wark in,
andfor poor boys and gals toplayin; did you ewer hear sich rubbish?"
"Well, I 'm not so sure about that," sez I.
"Well, you surprize me," sez he: "but have yon read the Chanse-
sellfT of the Xchekker's speech on the subjikP"
"No," sez I, "I have not; for the fact is the littel time I has to
dewote to Noosepapers, I have dewoted for the last week or two, to
studdying the manners and customs of the werry hiest of our hold
Nobillerty, as displayed for our respeofool amazement and amuse-
ment in Her Majesty's Courts of Justice."
"^Ah," sez he, "that's a pitty, or you wood have seen that by
having a commoner kind of Coles sent up from the pits, they wood
be ever so much cheaper."
"Well," sez I, "it does so appen, that for severial years I was in
the Cole Trade, in a small way myself, and I remembers we used
sumtimes to have a few of the cheap Coles up just to try em. But
they woodent do, not at no price. We used to call em Slack, coz they
was so preshus slow at burning, and Smudge, coz they made so much
mess, and so much smoke, and our poor customers soon found out, as
I have long found out, as the best Coles is the cheepest."
"Well," sez he, rather taken aback, "but how about the three-
hapence per sak, you wood like to save that, wouldn't yon?"
Well, I don't know," sez I. "My son WILLIAM has turned out
to be quite a grate Crickitter, and he telle me that the Jolly old
Copperashun has been and bort West Ham Park, down East, and
that every Satterday in the summer, he and his club plays Crickite
there, and sum i dozen other Clubs, without having nothink to pay
for it, and all under the charge of a fust rate Committee, whose
Cheerman was wnnce a fust-rate Crickitter, so he nose all about it,
and of Mr. Superintendent LORRENCE, who kindly takes oare of 'em
all; and twice a week a millingterry Band plays all the summer,
and thousands of peeple go to ear them, and the Copperashun pays
for that, and I sumtimes myself goes down to Epping Forrist to assist
wen a hole army of Charity Childem is taken down there for a day's
bout ing, and from what I hears of one place, and from what I sees
in another, wen the hole of the Childem is turned loose among the
beautiful trees and shrubbses, and seems hart' wild with hexsitement
and appyness, I for one says the kindly old Copperashun is quite

Stunning Form.
A DAY'S SHOOTING.
"As a display of fancy shooting, it was extremely varied and curious; aa
an exhibition of firing with any precise object, it was, upon the whole, per-
haps a failure."—Pt'tA-K'iH' Paper».
ALL the merry men of Mundesley, they
invited me to " shoots,"
So I took my Norfolk jacket and a pair of
porpoise boots;
And I looked out my breech-loader and I
totted up each cartridge,
And prepared for execution on the pheasant
and the partridge.
Prepared for Execution. W.e were quite a cheer-

And were "fit" as any "fiddles" for the work

it, " took the cake," _

Then I asked HUGH what their " form"
was, and he answered it was good,
While he said his own was " stunning,"
as I always knew he would;
But he added, "GEOBGE is awful," and
his eyes began to twinkle,
"For displays of fancy shooting he can
'rival Mr. Winkle."
I was nervous I will own it, for I vow I
will not yield, „
Unto any man in shirking being "potted" i,*»««
in a field;
It 's unpleasant to be peppered, and the poet
humbly begs,
He may never find the shot-corns stick like
currants in his legs.

rash, impulsive boy,

most captivating toy:

When we reached the scene of action, though the birds were rather

When we counted up the game-bag, GEORGE had surely shot his share,

",C. K." having left it to his revered Chief to decide both as to
the best solution of the puzzle-picture and the nature of the prize to
be awarded, we beg to announce, on behalf of Mr. Punch, that the
nearest approach to a complete Bolution has been reached by a
"STTBSCBIBEB" near Oxford, to whom the Artist's prize
,
and a copy of Mr. Punch's Boyal Jubilee Almanack have been
posted. And for ourselves", we add this, that never till within these
last ten days had we fully appreciated the nature and eitent of the
labour which must be undergone daily and weekly by a thoroughly
conscientious " Puzzle-Editor " on any one of our Society Papers."
No remuneration short of five thousand a year and a handsome
annuity to his wife and children, can possibly make up to him for
the wear and tear— a tremendous lot of tearing— of such an occupa-
tion. Surely " that way madness lies." And the taste for this sort
of thing is on the increase. All sorts and conditions of men and
women are for ever consulting about "lights," and words, and syl-
lables, and the poor Puzzle-Editors must be inundated by thousands
of letters, that is, if we judge by the flow of correspondence that has
been let loose upon us up to the date when we closed the flood-gates
and dammed the stream. Henceforth, no more puzzles, or, at all
events, not on the same conditions. This has been quite enough for
once. By the way, as the publication of the solution would in our
opinion only lead to further discussion, which would be quite un-
profitable, we keep it to ourselves, and only throw out these hints
that the dialogue was actually overheard, that the Conductor only
meant to chaff the old gentleman by posing him -with an utterly
absurd and pointless question, just as CHABLES тик SECOND posea

many quick-witted persons on whom the numour is dawning, and
who are beginning to roar over C. K.'s joke, and, on second thoughts,
to consider it as a regular side-eplitter.
HOW WE BEHAVE NOW;
OR, "MANNERS AND TONE OF GOOD SOCIETY."
SIR,—I can confirm .from personal experience every word of the
statement of a Correspondent of a provincial paper as to the had
manners now prevalent in London Society. It is a painful fact that
the rage for introducing" nobody, has now reached a scandalous
height, and that young gentlemen-callers are not even introduced to
the daughters of the house at which they visit! Well, Sir, I
happened the other day to he calling at Lady VERÉ DE BEAUVOIR'S
in Park Lane, although I must admit that 1 had not been asked to
do so, and that I had no acquaintance whatever with her Ladyship.
But having met one of the daughters at a ball, and having brought
myself under her notice by tripping over her dress in a waltz with
another partner, and apologising afterwards, I thought I had a right
to go and pay my respects at the Town mansion of the family.
Would you believe it? Not only was I not introduced to any one of
the visitor» present, hut Lady VERB DE BEAUVOIR herself received me
with a haughty stare, and her daughter pretended not to know who I
wat! After sitting in a corner looking over an album for one hour
and a half, and not even being introduced to the afternoon tea-pot of
which the other visitors were partaking, I left, slamming the
drawing-room door behind me to show my opinion of this specimen of
so-called aristocratic manner».—Yours indignantly, 8. NOBKINS.
SIR,—In a provincial journal I read that some idiotic oesthetio
people in London have taken to a new way of shaking hands—giving
a side-shake, in fact, instead of up and down. Where, I ask, are
we drifting to? If this sort of thing is permitted, Society will be
dissolved in ruins. Manners now are odiou» compared with what
they were when I was a boy. There is no warmth—no cordiality-
people don't seem glad to see one as they used to do; at least they
don't seem glad to see me. Yet I offer them my snuff-box freely,
and use it myself copiously, and I try to drink wine—as much as I
can carry—with all the young ladies present at a dinner-table, in the
jolly old fashion. What more can I do?
Yours wheezily, OCTOGENABIAN.
DEAS MR. PUNCH,
WE 'VE just brought out such a lovely œsthetic idea! Том,
my brother from Eton, says we ought to patent it, and I really think
I shall try to. Several times we have been so disgusted with finding
that people we invited did not harmonise properly with our furniture,
that last time we had a party we took the trouble to send specimens
of the hues which would match to each of our guests. What is the
use of having a house like ours (Том calls it "Liberty Hall") if we
allow people with hideous colours to come and jar on our artistic
sensibilities? The only objection to the plan we found to be, that all
the people we invited sent some excuse for not coming! Otherwise
it 's a «píen АУ plan. Том calls it the "High Art Invitation Wrinkle,"
and says it's " highly artful." We 've also invented a new mode of
bowing—not the old hideous bob forwards; Том calls this the "High
Art Break-back"; I can't explain it now, but I will some other day.
Yours, gushingly, HARMONICA.
Taurus and Pisces.
SPITE of speeches of CLEVELAND'S, one cannot believe lands
Like BULL'S and friend JONATHAN'S longer will squabble
Concerning their wishes about deep-sea fishes,
And lana us at last in a horrible hobble.

The rich finny spoils we as comrades may slaughter.
Soft, JONATHAN soft I Gently does it, you see, JOHN!

MEMOIRS OF A SECRET MISSION.
(Extracted from the Diary qf B r TO, M. P.)
~ Nice, Tuesday,—Had intended
to proceed from here to Genoa,
henoe to Spezzia, and во on to
Leghorn; but last night rumours
about of cholera at the two former
ports with attendant quarantine
regulations. Natural tendency
of Britisher to jeer at Conti-
nental regulations, exceptionally
justified in the matter of quaran-
tine. The Sailing-master puts
the whole question in a nut-shell.
"If," he says, "we go to
Genoa, drop anchor in the port
to-night and ' leave in the morn-
ing, we shall have to spend four
days in quarantine in the next
port at which we touch. But if
we take railway tickets for Genoa,
stay there a week, explore all the
slums, and mingle with the crowds
in the market-place, we can go
to the Station, take tickets for
Leghorn and enter that city, or any
other, without let or hindrance."
If there 's anything in the
world more foolish than this, the
Italian Government should have
an account of it printed in poly-
glot language and distributed
gratuitously among baffled and
irate voyagers. Hard lines too
on Genoa and Spezzia, which
must lose considerable sums of
money by being marked as plague-
spots to be avoided at any cost.
Got up steam at 3 A.M., and
made straight for Leghorn. A
beautiful day and the sea still lively. Reached Leghorn at three in the
afternoon; immediately challenged with having been to Genoa;
about a dozen vessels convicted of this high misdemeanour lying in
outer harbour with the yellow flag flying. One, a big steamer, crowded
with emigrants who thronged the deck forward, and gazed forlornly
across the water towards the town. Oar withers unwrung, we
entered the inner harbour; a scene of busy life, though not nearly so
picturesque as Nice. The main street, which comes down to the
harbour, crowded; nota stylish throng ; sailors form a fair proportion.
There are also many soldiers, much finer-looking men than the
representatives of the French Army at Nice.
The roadways are flagged all over; the population, made indepen-
dent of the pathways, stream across, to the great enjoyment of the
cabmen, who drive at full speed scattering the people right and left.
There is a tramway to which the oars are happily indifferent, running
on the flagged roadway about as often as on the rail. One or two
fine squares, and here and there a monument.
Wednesday.—To Pisa by an entirely new route. There is a rail-
way, also a canal. Had out the Steam-launch and went by canal.
General notion of a canal, a straight watercourse, by which it is
impossible to lose your way. Not the idea in Italy. As soon as we
had quitted the harbour and taken to the canal were involved in
a labyrinth of water-ways. This part of the town like a back street
in Venice: all the houses give out on to the canal, front doors opening
sheer on the water. The postman bringing the morning letters must
arrive by boat, and so must the afternoon-callers. The water-ways
are bisected by innumerable bridges, some so low that there were
moments of breathless excitement whilst it was decided whether the
smoke-stack of the launch could pass under, or whether we should
stick in the middle.
Proceedings watched with growing excitement by the population
of Leghorn. We were the first that"(in a steam-launch) ever burst
into this silent sea. That it somehow led to Piea we were convinced;
but by which of the interminable lines we could only guess. Con-
stantly turning up a passage to be brought up by a citizen's front-
door, or by a discovery that we had floated into a kind of dock. The
Sailing-master had provided himself with a book of English and
Italian conversation suitable for emergencies. It was A New
System, on the most simple principles, for Universal Self-tuition."
After we had backed out of the third cul-de-sac and come within
speaking distance of the crowd on one of the bridges, the Sailing-
master resolutely clutched the yellow-paper-backed System, and
undertook to control circumstances. "Гвау," he shouted, with the
yellow book open, "look here! Pare dovay andraymo al Pisa t"
A voice from the .bridge; '' Parla ella Italiano t"

He recited this slowly and with great distinctness, but to make it
clearer still, he repeated it in English. "Which way shall we go to
Pisa?" The crowd on the bridge looked at each other, and sadly
shook their heads.
"Parliamo solamente Italiano" said the spokesman.
"What do they say?" we asked the Sailing-master, who was
profusely perspiring and abstractedly mopped his forehead with the
New System. "I can't make out. I can speak the (Italian .well
enough, but I can't understand what they say in reply."
A onesided arrangement this, fatally lacking in completeness. We
moved on, and having explored nearly every silent street in thie
quarter, unexpectedly emerged upon a broad straight stream that
had no visible end. This was evidently our route. Steamed along
through miles of dreary marsh, in some places flooded; prospect a
little monotonous afterhrst hour. Then it began to rain : presently it
came down in torrents; distance by this winding canal far beyond
our estimation. Three hours and a half outward passage and same
home, would leave us about half an hour to see Pisa and get back
before nightfall. Should we turn back? Two minutes of damp and
depressed hesitation. Decided to go on.
Popular reception at Pisa. Canal-side population crowded the
banks to see this strange spectacle. No sign from the Canal of the
Leaning Tower or the Cathedral. All faith in the Sailing-master as
an interpreter, swamped in the canal at Leghorn. He insisted with
pathetic iteration, that he could ask a question well enough. If,
when he addressed the natives in Italian, they replied in English, all
would be well. Pointed out that that could scarcely be expected in
Pisa. Nothing for it but to go ashore and feel our way towards
the Tower, or as the Sailing-master in his pedantic manner called it,
"the Campanilly." This word acted as a talisman, when uttered by
itself. Planting his back against the wall and opening the yellow-
book, the Sailing-master, addressing the crowd generally, began :—
"Pare dovay andraymo Campanilly—which is the way to
the Campanilly '("
A look of blank despair fell over the throng of eager faces. But
when the Sailing-master, dispensing with the preface, simply said
"Campanilly?" there was aquick responsive shout of " Si Stynor!"
and a dozen men and boys pressed forward to show the way.
No fiacres in sight ;had to walk through the still falling rain and
the muddy streets. Pisa seemed to be at siesta: the crowd on the
banks of the canal remained there, awaiting our return; not a soul
was met in the broad thoroughfares leading to the Cathedral. We
found tin: Tower leaning quite as much as could be expected, but
the day was too dark to see the pictures in the Cathedral. Hurried
back to the launch, and amid a murmur of excitement echoing
from bank to bank, passed out through the canal and bock through
the gloomy marshes.
Friday.—A magnificent day, of itself worth the journey to see.
Not a cloud in the sky, the dazzling blue of which is tempered by a
fleecy mist. The Mediterranean sparkling in the sunlight. Steam
up after breakfast and made for Elba. Arrived at three o'clock;
anchored at Porto Terrajo. Seventy-two years ago, NAPOLEON fresh
from Fontainebleau, did the same. Fancy there is nothing altered in
the appearance of the town during the interval. Very little building
has gone on since the time of the Grand Duke Cosmo of Florence,
who created the place. It is built up the side of a hill, a senes of
terraces of houses. It is the most locked-up town I ever saw, which
makes it ensuite with the Bagno standing at the entrance of the
port. « Passing by any of the two or three streets that run up the hill
you come to the walls of the powder magazine; skirting these you
reach a gate which is locked. Trying back you come to more dead
walls, more locked gates, and finally are beaten back to the Pier. I
suppose there is some way of getting out on the land side, but it is
not easy to find. A curious sense of being shut iin. What a place
for NAPOLEON to come to!
"Yes," says the Sailing-master, "he must have sorely ached for
lack of Elba room." At this remark I scarcely knew whether to
smile pityingly, or to resent it. But the Sailing-master has made his
little joke so innocently, that I feel convinced he has never beard it
before; or if he has, he thinks /haven't.
The house in which NAPOLEON dwelt from the 5th May, 1814, to the
•лиh February, 1815, still stands, unchanged like everything else in
Elba. Is now the residence of one of the Italian officials. It stands well
at the back of the town with a beautiful view of the Mediterranean.
From the window the dethroned Emperor could see his birthplace,

n the depths. "Well," says the Sailing-master, "it may be true

smile, sadly, and, were it worth while, I would remonstrate.
A beautiful bay it is, set in an amphitheatre of mountains. Every
evening at five o'clock, just as the sun goes down, the silence is
>roken by the tramp of men, and the clank of chains. Then appear
letachmente of ten men each, fettered to a common chain and
warded by two soldiers with loaded rifles. These are the galley-
ilaves. They have been at work somewhere on the fortifications, and
his is their home-coining in the golden sunset.
Sunday.—Paid a visit this morning to the Bagno. Shown over the
)lace, which save in two aspects is not so bad as fancy painted it.
Го begin with, there is more light and air than in an English prison.
This is one of the beautiful days that vindicate the climatic character
of Italy, of late grievously undermined. Consequently all the
windows in the prison were open, a soft warm air blowing in, here
ind there the prospect of the blue sea, and the distant hills. Great
Dody of the convicts at work, some making baskets, others shoes,
nuny weaving, and a few proudly engaged in cabinet-making. All
;he prisoners day and night year a chain fastened from the waist to
;he leg. When they go out in gangs, a connecting chain keeps them
in hand, like so many cattle; at night each man is locked to a ring
at the foot of his bed. In the infirmary was one old man with
infinitely weary look, lying on a bed; looked as if he would be
înally released before the new week is over. In the meantime he
wore his chain. This was one of the sadder aspects. The other was
the prisoners condemned to solitary confinement. These have no
bench to sit on by day, nor bed to lie on at night. Regarding them
through the peephole at the door, they are seen standing forlornly
against the wall chained to a ring in the floor.
This afternoon a native, who once spent a few weeks on a British
ship, and is locally credited with ability to speak English, came
breathlessly on board with news that "the Government" was coming
to see the yacht. "The Government" arrived a quarter of an hour
later. Spoke excellent English, in which he gave graphic account
of his desolation. No one to see, no one to speak to, from January to
December. Lives in a house adjoining that occupied by NAPOLEON.
Invited us to visit it. Here NAPOLEON'S mother lived durinç her
son's captivity, and every day NAPOLEON used to visit her, remaining
with her an hour. He had a postern door made in the wall dividing
the two gardens. It remains to this day, but the key is lost, and no
one uses it. It is a dmgy room in which the mother and son sat and
talked over things past and to come. There is a view over the red-
tiled roofs of Porto Ferrajo, on to the bay and the mountains that
encircle it. Only from NAPOLEON'S own house and garden spread
out the expanse of sea that led back to France.
P.S.—Important. Saturday. Received following telegram from Our
Great Chief, dated this morning :—" Read with interest your report of
interview with Prince of MONACO. Feel should strike whilst the iron
is hot. Accordingly start to-day for Monte Carlo. Shall open com-
munications with Prince on other side of Bay. Markise goes with me."

A NEW TITLE.
AT the City Conservative Club Banquet, on Wednesday last, the
two Graces—[only two of them, one before, and one after dinner, the
third Grace being, perhaps, a Liberal, and therefore omitted]—were
"sung by the Lay Vicars of Salisbury Cathedral," who also treated
the company to "several part-songs during the evening."
Excellent name for them, "the Lay Vicars!" Each Vicar
coming with his own lay, and'then joining in the general harmony.
But why not improve the title? We can suggest a great improvement.
Listen. The Daily Telegraph, in an apt and friendly article last
week, spoke of Mr. Punch as the Doyen, or " Dean of the Chapter"
—Dean of several chapters, satirical, humorous, and pathetic. Well,
if Dean PUNCH should ever have at his disposal a "quire," not
in twenty-four white sheets, but members of the surplice popu-
lation, he would certainly style them his "Ri-Tooral-li-Lay-Vicars."
And how proud they would be!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

IN THE COURT OF COMMON SENSE.
(Before Mr. Justice 0'Pinion, sitting without a Jury.)
THE time of his Lordship was taken up in trying four actions, which it had
been arranged should be heard together. The Plaintiffs were four Statesmen,
who asked for
dtimapca against
Mr. Punch on the
score that they had
sustained lose on
account of the pub-
lication by the
Defendant of cer-
tain libels.
The Manager of
the Main - sheet
Collar Company.
Limited, was called
by the first Plain-
tiff,.the Right Hon.
W. E. GLADSTONE,
M.P., and said that
he believed shirt-
collars had been
supplied by his
Company to Mr.
GLADSTONE. The
Right Honourable
gentleman had been
depicted in the
pages of the Lon-
don Charivari
wearing Main-sheet
Collars. He believed
that the size of the
Main-sheet Collars
had been exagge-
"Bother the Flies! and at this time of year too!" rated. Had the size
of the collars not been exaggerated, he believed that the Right Hon. Gentleman
would still have worn them. He believed that Mr. GLADSTONE was forced to
give the collars up, as ridicule and contempt had been cast upon them.
Cross-examined: He would not swear that the size of the Main-sheet Collars
had been exaggerated. It was only his impression. Main-sheet Collars of a
larger size than those depicted by the Defendant as having been worn by
Mr. GLADSTONE, had been supplied to other political personages. He declined
to give the names of the political personages to whom the extra large-sized
Main-sheet Collars had been supplied.
The Judge. You must answer the question unless you can 'give a sufficient
reason for your silence.
Witness. I refuse to give the name of the political personages to whom extra
large-sized Main-sheet Collars have been supplied, as I am not bound to incrimi-
nate myself. (Sensation.)
Cross-examination continued: He would not swear that extra sized Main-sheet
Collars had not been supplied to Jx>rd RANDOLPH CHUBCHILL and Mr. HERBERT
GLADSTONE. (Renewed sensation.) He believed that Collars had been supplied
to Mr. GLADSTONE by other firms. He himself had suffered loss by the non-
wearing of the collars, and Mr. GLADSTONE'S washerwoman had told him
The Judge (interrupting). You must not tell us what Mr. GLADSTONE'S
washerwoman, or any other washerwoman, told you.
Re-examination: He believed that Mr. GLADSTONE, by giving up Main-sheet
Collars, had suffered a loss of personal dignity.
To the Judge; His belief was merely an impression, and did not "rest upon
any substantial fact.
The Right Hon. JOHN BRIGHT, M.P., said that he had been depicted by the
Defendant wearing an eye-glass. He had never worn an eye-glass in his life.
Cross-examined: He had never tried to wear an eye-glass. He did not
know that he could make an eye-glass adhere to his eyelid without pain. Were
he certain that he could have accomplished the feat, he believed he might
possibly have adopted an eye-glass when he was a member of Mr. GLADSTONE'S
Cabinet. He would not deny that an eye-glass might be a useful adjunct to
any one who had to give official answers in the House of Commons. An eye-
glass was certainly very becoming to Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER (the Right Hon. Lord RANDOLPH
CHURCHILL, M.P.) said that he had often been depicted by the Defendant in the
pages of the London Charivari. He had .been represented as shorter than he
really was. He was rather above the average height.
Cross-examined: He certainly would wish to resemble Mr. Punch. He had
been represented as taller than Mr. Punch. There was nothing ridiculous in
the size of Mr. Punch. He did not mind appearing in the pages of the
London Charivari, when he was represented with his complement of inches.
He would like to be depicted as taller than Mr. CHAPLIN. As a matter of fact,
he was taller than that Right Hon. Gentleman when he wore one particular pair
of boots. Some of his boot« had higher heels than others. He would be sorry
if he were ignored, and he was quite sure that all other politicians would
equally regret to be overlooked. Tall men could not be overlooked, except by
taller men. He was of opinion that the portraits of Messrs.
GLADSTONE and BRIGHT were excellent, although he con-
sidered the caricatures of himself of less merit. He had
reasons for believing that Messrs. GLADSTONE and BRIGHT
considered the caricatures of himself entirely admirable,
and of far greater merit than their own portraits.
The Right Hon. JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN, M.P., said that
he had been depicted by the Defendant as a "daring
duckling." As he was a man, of course he could not be
a bird.
Cross-examined: He was bound to admit that he owed
his reputation for shrewdness and ability to the Defen-
dant. He did not mind being sketched by Mr. Punch,
although he objected to being drawn by any one else.
(Laughter.) He liked Mr. Punch's pictures of Mr. GLAD-
STONE, and considered the collars quite the best part of
that Right Hon. Gentleman. He was an expert in eye-
glasses. He considered that Mr. BRIGHT acquired in-
creased dignity by being represented as wearing one.
He was sorry to see that recently Mr. TENNIEL had
dropped Mr. BRIGHT'S eye-glass. He could not say
whether Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL was tall or short in
person. He had brought this action because he wished
to do what little he could to reunite the great Liberal
Party. He could not eay exactly how it would reunite
the Party, but he dare say it would be as successful as
any of his attempts in the same direction.
The Defendant was not called upon to reply.
Mr. Justice O'PlNioN said that, in all his legal ex-
perience, never had such frivolous complaints been
brought before him. Mr. Punch had, as was his wont,
laughed good-humonredly at the personal peculiarities
of public men,—if those personal peculiarities shadowed
forth a deeper meaning, if huge collars suggested
stubbornness, a small body a frivolous mind, or an eye-
glass a relinquishment of old principles, so much the
worse—for the public men. The Defendant had a long
record of most honourable service to the State, and he (hie
Lordship) had great pleasure in announcing (although,
perhaps, the announcement, as self-evident, was super-
fluous) that Mr. Punch left that Court without a stain
upon his character.
Loud and long-prolonged cheering, in which the
Ushers, the Judge, and Mr. Punch himself joined.
Subsequently Plaintiffs and Defendant dined together,
and, before separating, arranged to form a new Cabinet,
of which they should be the first original members.
"What is a Spook?"
THE Saturday Review finds some difficulty in satisfac-
torily answering this question. Much it finds to say in
explanation, and the rest it leaves to Spookioal Research.
"A Spook "may be a sound, a spirit, a sensation, an
apparition. On this information Mr. Punch decides that
the one answer to " What is a Spook?" is " That it is
quite immaterial."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"THE FRIENDLIES."
MB. PUNCH thanks "the
Friend lies" generally, in
town and country, headed
by the Daily Telegraph, for
their genial and sympathetic
articles on the recent case.
He also thoroughly appre-
ciates his young fnend Mo-
dern Truth'» way of putting
it. As .1 KFKFUSO.V, ш Rip
van Winkle, used to say.
"May you live long and
brosber." Mr. Punch'» at-
tention was specially drawn
to a kindly leaderette in the
Globe, and he hopes to take
an early opportunity of prov-
ing the truth of his old friend
and excellent Counsel Mr.
MONTAGU WILLIAMS'S asser-
tion, that "Punch has no
politics," in the sense, that
is, of being a partisan. He
is of Everybody's politics
and of Nobody's party. He
is not a Democrat, but a
DEMOCBITUS. In one respect
he resembles the "great
Globe itself," inasmuch as
he tries his best to take "an
all - round view" of every
question, social and political.
JOBS WITHOUT JOBBERY.—
The unpopularity of the late
Mr. Л у к ION- has been ascribed
to a "marked character-
istic," namely, "his detesta-
tion of anything which had
the attributes of a job."

time at least, will be indeed

best wishes of Mr. Punch,
and of all admirers of pluck,
constancy, and devotion will
go with him. May he have
the pleasure of reporting a
second and modified version
of his famous laconism, and,
doffing his hat, as he mav do

"Dr. EMIN, I presume!"

commendation to take his

AFTER THE PLAY.
Mr. Punch. When a piece has been running for over a hundred
and fifty nights, and is still as fresh as it was at the start, and even
in better condition, a favourable opinion, on
these grounds alone, may be fairly formed of
its staying powers.
Mr. Nibos. Quite so, Sir. And as I heard
you had lately visited the Vaudeville, "may
I take it," as a Counsel says, that you are
alluding to Mr. BUCHANAN'S play of Sophia f
Mr. P. It was of Sophia I was speaking.
Mr. N. It was almost a pity that the
dramatist didn't leave FIELDING'S immortal
Tom Jones alone.
Mr. P. "Almost a pity," Mr. NIBBS! Your
qualification has in it a certain humorous
* subtlety which I appreciate. Sir, you know
'as well as I do that the immortality of
FIELDING'S Tom Jones will be untouched were a thousand dramas
founded on the story of his career.
Mr. N. Yes, Sir—but to those who know the book
Mr. P. And how many who talk so learnedly about FrELBiNO,|and
"sacrilege," and all that sort of cant, have really, I won't say
studied, but even read Tom Jones through from, beginning to end P
Now, Mr. NIBBS, did you ever read it right through in the same way
that yon have read Vanity Fair, Barry Lyndon, Pickwick, David
Copperfield, or Oliver Twist f
Mr. N. I confess I should pass but a poor examination in it.
Mr. P. There are not very many who could take honours in
such an examination; and, of the younger folk, I do not suppose
that an acquaintance with Tom Jones's history would be peculiarly
desirable. Now Mr. BUCHARAS, the Author of Sophia, has given
the leading points of the story, has cleansed and preserved the
characters, has worked up the dramatic situations, and, in my
humble opinion, has given us one of the best plays I have seen for

a considerable time. Its moral is excellent—virtue is rewarded, if
to unite sweet Sophia Western to reckless Tom Jones be a reward,
—and vice is punished, but not too severely, as maundering old Mr.
Alltoorthy is just the man to forgive Blifil, and would probably
go so far as to ask Mr. and Mrs. Ji/iiil (née Seagrim), and her
charming brother, George^ to stay with him.
Mr. N. George Seagrtm's make-up is wonderful. Something
between a brigand and a red Indian.
Mr. P. Yes, Rough and Reddy. It was evident that if George
had been caught by the keepers, he would have been taken red-
handed.
Mr. N. Mr. THORNB'S Partridge is good, Sir?
Mr. P. I have seldom seen Mr. THORNE better. It was full of
heartv force. A quaint, eccentric, yet homely character, exactly
suited to Mr. THOENE'S peculiarities. I wish, however, that this
gentleman had not contracted the habit of shutting his eyes when he
advances to the footlights to address the audience. This mannerism
always seems to recall the fact that he once played a blind man in
The Two Hoses. However, there is no sort of reason that Partridge,
who ordinarily kept his eyes pretty wide open, should not have
shut them occasionally (as indeed he did} to his beloved master's
defects. I have seldom enjoyed a Partridge more than the one
served up by Mr. THORNE at the Vaudeville.
Mr. N. The Ladies, Sir?
Mr. P. The ladies by all means. Their health and bless 'em!
There are not two prettier faces on the stage than those of Miss KATE
Кокки, the Sophia, and iMiss HELEN FORSYTH, the Molly Seagrim.
And in no theatre could the parts have found more fitting repre-
sentatives.
Mr. N. I am entirely of your opinion, Sir, and I think that as
far as the ladies are concerned, your remark applies all round at the
Vaudeville. Miss ROSE LECLEKCQ couldn't he improved upon as
Lady Bellaston—a. repulsive part as delicately played as may be,
and the same may be said of the simpering spinster Miss Western,
played by Miss SOPHIE LUIKTN.

physique and style, as it aeemed to me, are rather too heavy for the
rakish touch-and-go Tom Jones, and the artificiality of his assump-
tion was brought out no less by the stolid realism of Partridge,
than by the freshness and the unconventional earnestness of Sophia't
acting.
Mr. 2f. Tes, Sir, and yet there is something pleasant in his imper-
sonation of the hero.
Mr. P. There is always a heartiness in Mr. WARNER'S manner
which takes the fancy of an English audience. He would do well
not to rely on this too much. As for the other characters—well
Mr. N. Wasn't Squire Western too loutish?
Mr. P. Very difficult to pronounce on such a character as repre-
sented. FIELDIKO'S Squire Western is a coarse violent pig-headed
old brute and bully, and to represent him as a Mr. Hardcaitle, or
"a fine old English gentleman, one of the olden time," would have
been a great mistake on the part of either author or actor. The fault
in Mr. FRED THORNE'S impersonation seemed to_ me, that he
represented the Squire as in a chronic state of stupid intoxication.
I congratulate him on his art, wishing for him some worthier
character on which to exercise it.
Mr. 2f. Mr. Allworthy is a melancholy 'person as played by Mr.
GILBERT FABQÜHAB.
Mr. P. Somewhat; butrememherJ/r.^4№coriAyisaquiet,benevo-
lent gentleman intended to be contrasted with the Squire, and if
Mr. THORITE is right in his impersonation in being so druuk, then Mr.
FARQTTHAR is equally correct in being so preternatnrally sober. When
the Squire roars with laughter, Mr. AUworthy tarns up his eyes to the
sky-borders, and seems to breathe a prayer; when the Squire
flourishes a whip, Mr. Allworthy deprecatingly raises his hands and
remains in the somewhat angular attitude of a saintly personage in a
painted window. Throughout the piece Mr. AUworthy, as a rule,
is either being shocked and painea or cruelly deceived; he never
knows whom to believe, and glides dolefully about the stage mutely
appealing to the audience for the sympathy which is rarely refused
by a generous public to anyone so deeply suffering— and for over one
hundred and fifty nights too—as this poor dear Mr. Allworthy, who
is indeed a sight pleasing to the gods and pit—a good man struggling
with adversity.
Mr. N. You have forgotten Miss LOTTIE YENNE as Mistress
Honour!
Mr. P. "All (rone, save Honour!" Indeed I had, but'only for a
moment. Mr. NIBBS, she is the sparkle of the piece, diminutive,
quaint, pretty, irresistibly comical LOTTIE VENNE I clever little
actress for fun or pathos! and as for mischief, there's not another
soubrette on the stage within measurable distance of her.
Mr. N. I'm always glad when there's a part а-lottie'd to her.
She is the chief Miss Mis-chief.
Mr. P. Thank you, Mr. NIBBS. I must take care of my pockets.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH'S STUDIO.
No. VIII.—ME. JEREMIAH JOBSON, STOCK BROKE».
MR. JEREMIAH JOBSON was
one of the most highly re-
spected members of that won-
drous institution, the London
Stock Exchange. His character
was as spotless as his linen, and
his habits as regular as his
chronometer. He had never been
absent from his office one whole
day for twenty years past, ex-
cept during the month of August,
wnich month he invariably de-
dicated to rest and relaxation
in the pure and bracing air of
Margate.
He always went to town by
the same omnibus, abhorring
Underground Railways, and, of
Í course, always inside. He had
on one memorable occasion,
when the omnibus was filled
with young ladies from a neigh-
bouring Academy, been per-
suaded by a friend to ride out-
side, and, it being a fine warm
morning, had confessed that he
found it very pleasant; but, he
added, the awful thought that
he „¿¿ht be seen by some of his
m<>st important clients, seated on
that "bad eminence," or even
olimbingup, or struggling down, its narrow stairs, filled him with such
alarm, that nothing could ever induce him to repeat the experiment.
Mr. JOBSON resided in the romantic Suburb of Pecknam, was
married, but childless, and was very popular with his о wnparticnl ar set,
and thoroughly trusted by his numerous connection. He used to tell
very amusing anecdotes, and was known on several occasions, when
certain of his clients were, as he thought, going somewhat beyond the
bounds of prudence, to warn them against the possible consequences,
and with such delicacy and good humour, as made them readily
excuse his interference, and even at times take his kindly warning.
Mr. JOBSON was naturally of a very hospitable disposition, and his
cosy little dinner-parties were highly appreciated by his own
particular set. There was one pleasant form out seldom absent from
those enjoyable evenings, whose genial nature and fund of anecdote
and knowledge of men and things made him a welcome guest every-
where, but who was always received with especial cordiality by the
somewhat precise Stock Broker and his prim little wife, and by all
their City friends.
There was something so fresh, so hearty, so unconventional, and so
intensely amusing about Том ROBINSON'S conversation, when seated
at a well-appointed table, with an appreciative audience, so different
altogether from the ordinary talk concerning Stocks and Shares of the
City Brokers, that they all with one accord voted him the prince of
good fellows, and went their way laughing at his last good joke; and
sometimes, it must be confessed, wondering how it came to pass that
old JOBSON could have made the acquaintance of so brilliant and
handsome a swell, but of course their natural good-breeding,—for
Stock Brokers are. as a rule, very well-bred men, or they would not
inspire the confidence they do,—forbad them ever making any
allusion to so delicate a subject.
The remark has often been made, but remains as true as when first
uttered, that we all have a touch of romance somewhere in our
various natures. Even Stock Brokers are no exceptions to the role.
What are thought to be exceptions are those cases where the feeling
has had no opportunity of developing itself, but it is there though it
lies dormant, and is easily awakened. To look at.! K.IIKMi.\ n JOBSON,
Stock Broker, of Drapers' Court, when taking instructions from
some respected client for the sale or investment of certain Stocks or
Shares, the whole of his little soul absorbed apparently in the profit-
able occupation in which he was engaged, who would have thought
that there had been a time when " to his eye there was but one be-
loved face on earth, and that was shining on him "! But it was
true, nevertheless, and terribly he paid, poor fellow! for mistaking
for love what was really only very affectionate respect. She was ten
years his junior, exceedingly beautiful, graceful as KATE VAUOHAN,
and the idol of her father. She declined his honest offer with true
womanly delicacy, and shortly afterwards married a brilliant adven-
turer. Poor JOBSON bore his disappointment like the gentleman he
was. He was not a French scholar, but he acted in full accord with
the fine old French maxim :—
"Le brait est pour le fat, I L'honnête homme trompé
La plainte est pour le Bot; | S'éloigne et ne dit mot."
So he kept watch, as it were, over her future, and when she
died, less than two years after her marriage, he hovered round her
grave tül her friends had left, and then dropped a few flowers therein
somewhat moistened with his manly tears.
She left a son, who, on his father's death, inherited but little
except his mother's winning, fascinating ways, and his father's hand-
some person. It was therefore not at all surprising that young ROBIW-
8ON, when he grew to man's estate, should be a welcome guest at the
Stock Broker's little villa, or that when he was occasionally "pretty
well stumped," as he termed it, he knew exactly where to go for a
little temporary assistance, which said assistance was always readily
forthcoming, and seldom of the temporary character he possibly
anticipated. In fact, the influence of the handsome, dashing West-
Ender, whose presence always brought back to his host the memory
of those blissful days when he revelled in the thought that his love
was returned, was gradually becoming greater and greater, and even
threatened to become dangerous.
Business matters, too, did not prosper so well as formerly with the
good-natured Mr. JOBSON. But there was always seen the old glow of
delight when Том ROBINSON'S bright presence lighted up the little
room, and banished, at any rate for a time, all thoughts of business cares
or troubles. Том was one of those jovial and genial natures that
was sure to ingratiate itself into the very soul of a man like JOBSON.
He was always radiant with present enjoyment and future expecta-
tion, and all gloomy or doubtful thoughts faded away before his gay
laugh and his teeming fancy, like fog before the autumn son. He
had lately, he told them one night, got into quite a new set—regalar
swells, who knew how to enjoy life as life was intended to be
enjoyed, and who had welcomed him among them for his dear
father's sake. One of them was considered to be about the keenest
man of business about Town, and he had got an idea into his fertile
brain that was some day to astonish the financial world with its
novelty and success. Of course his hearers shook their grave heads
at his glowing picture, and warned him against all such baseless
bubbles; but Том laughingly replied that, as he had nothing to lose,
he did not think there was very much fear of his losing it.
Matters went on much as usual for a few months longer, until one
fine morning, for the first time in his life. Том ROBINSON found him-
self in Mr. JOBSON'S office in Drapers' Court, accompanied by the
keen man of business of whom he had spoken in such glowing colours
a short time previously. He was a remarkably mild gentlemanly
man, with a truly noble forehead, and a bright keen eye, faultlessly
dressed, and with the whitest and most delicately shaped hands ever
possessed by one of his sex. The usual introductions having taken
place, it was suggested by the visitor that Том should amuse himself
out of doors for the next half hour, and then return and hear the
result of their deliberations. This he accordingly did. and was
informed on his return, that the discussion between his two friends had
been of the most satisfactory character, and that all the necessary
arrangements had been made for commencing at once.
In about a week's time a prospectus appeared in all the principal
London journals, that literally took the public by storm. Such a
list of Directors had seldom been seen attached to a similar document,
Том ROBINSON and his friend were of course among them, and the
name of Mr. JKKEMIAH JOBSON appeared as the Broker to the
Company. The rush for shares was tremendous, and they were quoted
at a considerable premium long before allotment. Том ROBINSON
was radiant with delight at his brilliant prospects, and indulged in
hie new-born love for speculation to his heart's content.
• # ~ • * * *
It is perhaps scarcely necessary to add that all these bright
anticipations were doomed to fade away, as is the case in so many
similar cases, and that the shares that had been sought so eagerly,
were found to be worthless.
The anxieties and humiliations endured by poor Mr. JOBSON during
this trying period may be easily imagined, and they reached their
climax when he received a letter to the following effect :—
"MY DEAJÏ KIND FHIEND,—I am so heartily sick of London since
our last misfortune, lhat I have readily accepted the offer of a post
in India, and shall have started ere this reaches you. I cannot suffi-
ciently express my gratitude for all your kindness. I fear that I
have availed myself of your kind permission to draw upon you for a
moderate sum, to a larger extent than you had intended, but I
assure you it was quite unavoidable. I enclose particulars, and am
yours most affectionately, T. ROBINSON."
There was a terrible struggle betwixt contending feelings in poor
JOBSON'S curious nature, but the old sentiment conquered, and he
paid all, leaving himself almost a beggar.
He may still be seen occasionally wending his way through Throg-
morton Street, more from habit than for any business purpose, and
room is made for him with much kindly respect.
The moral drawn from his sad case by one of his old Peckham
cronies is, that Stock Brokers have nothing to do with Romance, or
Horse Dealers with Truth; and if they ever do indulge in those
luxuries, they are pretty certain to come to grief.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A STATEMENT AND A DUTY.
MR. PUNCH has to make'a statement and perform a duty. The
statement is thia :—A set of verses, not written, it is fair to say, by
any member of Mr. Punch's regular staff, headed with an ijlustra-
tion by one of his own clever Artists, who signed it with his usual
initials, showin? a musician seated at a piano, playing in a grotesque
and exaggerated style, appeared in the Number for November 27,
entitled, A Made Musician." This picture, as Mr. Punch was
informed subsequent to its publication, was a caricature of Mr.
ISIDORE DE LARA, the well-known Composer and Singer, of which
this gentleman would no more have complained than would have
other public characters of their caricatures appearing from time to
time in Mr. Punch's collection, had it not been that the picture at
once stamped the verses beneath as referring to him and his career
in a way that Mr. Punch, on unquestionable evidence, has now no
hesitation in declaring to be libellous and untrue. So much for the
statement; the evident duty is that, under these circumstances,
Mr. Punch, who, previous to this, was unacquainted, privately and
personally, with Mr. DE LARA (though there was a complimentary
allusion to him, as a Composer, in the Number for February 20th of
this year), hastens to express his unfeigned regret for the appearance
of these lines in his pages. Mr. DE LARA, whose friends and family
have been deeply pained—as has been also Mr. Punch—professes
himself satisfied with the same publicity, as was obtained by the
poem and picture, being given by Mr. Punch, to this expression of
unqualified retractation and regret.
NOVELTIES AT NOVELLO'S.
THE Concert of the NOVELL« Oratorio series last week opened
cheerfully with a funeral march. It suggested that we had come to
bury Ccesar, not to praise him, Casar being
either Mr. STANFORD or Mr. MACKENZIE for
this occasion only. It was perfectly played,
but Mr. MACKENZIE was quite riíht in not
accepting an encore, as a second performance
of a Funeral March must always suggest a
Re-hearse- al. After this came the t wo great
undertakings of the evening, and the violin-
isrs had their "mutes " ready when wanted.
"We expected to see Mr. HAYDEN COFFIN,
but he didn't arrive. "Revenge. Timo-
theus (Tennyton) cries," and Mr. VILLIERS
STANFORD has set it to music. It was en-
thusiastically received, and the Composer
was thrice called, like Macbeth.
Let us suggest an idea to the Composer, in
the same metre :—
"Then aware our VILLIBHS STANFORD, 'Bring Merlon and bring Sanford,
(I omit the letter " d " from the Sandford, as you see)
Bring me Mister Barlow, too, and I 41 see what I can do
To write eomething in this line, a Cantata. Christmaasee.'"
After everyone had been satisfied with "Revenge," they were
refreshed with a love-story,—libretto by Mr. BKNNETT, on EDWIN
ARNOLD'S poem, music by Dr. MACKENZIE,—entitled Sayid, which,
as Mr. WAGSTAFF would naturally observe, is "Sayid and Sung."
The Cantata is an excellent piece of work, but, like " linked sweet-
ness," it is a little too "long drawn out." Madame ALBANI was in
superb voice, and, with Messrs. McGucxiN and WATXIN MILLS, did
full justice to the Composer. Madame ALBANI scored—after the
Composer, of course—in the solo, "Aye, sweet indeed is Love "—and
sweet indeed it waa. Mr. MCUUCKIN'S solo, " Where sets the Sun"
(to which there ought to be the reply, " Not on the British Umpire ")
was rapturously applauded, and the solemn march was impressively
rendered ; but the performance, as a whole, was unequal.
After all, Cantatas are only Operas produced on the most economical
principles. How much more telling would Sayid be on the stage.
To intelligently enjoy a Cantata at a first hearing, an intimate ac-
quaintance with the book is essential. Without the book, how pos-
sibly could the sharpest-witted person arrive at the fact that Mr.
BARTON McGucmi, in ordinary evening dress, and looking as amiable
as possible, was representing an Arab Sheik; and that pleasant Mr.
WATKIN MILLS was supposed to be the personification of a fierce
Hindoo Chieftain, who has taken Sheik McGucKiN prisoner, and
condemned him to death P Aleo, where is the individual so gifted
as to recognise at a glance a gentleman in the Chorus, who uplifts
his voice in a solo, as a " Horseman," who "rides into the midst of
the throng?"
Sayid is full of dramatic action, and is as spectacular as The
Mikado. Why should it not be brought out as an Opera? That an
Oratorio dealing with Scriptural characters, should not be produced
on the Stage, is intelligible. A singer in evening dress as Elijah,
for example, no matter how commanding his presence, how perfeci
his voice, how white his neck-tie, or how respectable and exoellenl

lis reputation, cannot be a realisation of the Prophet of the Old Testa-
nent; nor would he be a whit more во were he to appear behind the
'ootlights with a scalp and venerable beard from CLAHKSON'S and a
lowing robe from MAT'S, or, more appropriately, from NATHAN'S.
; it is better that Oratorios and Cantatas on Scriptural subjects
should be treated as they are now; but, where the characters are
egendary, and the work depends greatly upon scenes, costumes, and
dramatic action, let it be boldly Drought out as an Opera wherever
:here is a theatre (and here perhaps is a difficulty) open to receive
t. We have Sayid our say.
"UNION STORAGE BATTERY."—The new machine belongs to the
Onion Electoral Power and Diffused Light Company, and is worked
ra "CHAMBERLAIN'S Patent." In the course of the next two months
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN will exhibit its qualities at Hawick, Ayr, and
Edinburgh, previous to a grand display at Birmingham. In this
lattery there is said to be no waste of power by local action, and ne
danger is incurred by the useless consumption of expensive material.
"THIS BY HIS VOICE SHOULD BE A MONTAGU!".
MR. MATTHEWS was
lever more at Home as
;he HOME SECRETARY
ап in appointing Mr.
MONTAGU WILLIAMS to
>e Police-Magistrate at
Woolwich. His voice will

make himself heard, and

miliarity with the prac-
iice he is about to
direct, if astuteness,
patience, cool commnn
sense, and a keen per-
ception of the ridiculous
— which serves as a
créât safeguard against
committing oneself, like
Mr. Nupkins, instead
of committing a prisoner—if all these be the qualifications for a good
Police-Magistrate, then Mr. MONTAGU WILLIAMS is the man for
the place; and Punch, inspired by the Spooké of the other WILLIAMS
—not the Barrister, but " the Divine WILLIAMS "—exclaims,
"0 Brother Montagu! Gire me thy hand!"
and therewith wishes the new Magistrate many a Merry Christmas
and any number of the Happiest New Years 1

OUR CARD-BASKET.
"Mr Cards and Crackers!"—sounds like a good old méditerai oath doesn't it? It is,
however, nothing of th« kind, but simply Mr. Punch't exclamation on inspecting; the contents
of his Card-Basket. Here are wondrous artistic marvels from RAPHAEL TUCK & Co., over
•which the artists have evidently tuk great pains. There are specialities from CASTELL
BROTHERS, impressed with coins, which look natural enough to spend, there are dainty
designs from WIRTHS BROTHERS, worth anything you please. SOCKL AND NATHAN, send
sweet, soft-scented satin souvenirs properly painted with pretty pictures. PRANG & Co.,
provide clever designs, some large enough for framing. PHILIPP BROTHERS contribute
tasteful trifles, and DAVIDSON BROTHERS offer cards of endless variety. J. F. BENNET has
a speciality in the "Vieptte" card, and some of a humorous nature are published by M. H.
NATHAN & Co. MARCUS WARD—who might be called the Cardinal of Carda—still holds his
own. Every year brings some novelty, and this season the satin-bound books will undoubtedly
prove popular. The etchings and hunting scenes from HARDING will probably be in brisk
demand, so will the novelties from MISCH
AND STOCK—the coloured views of the
Colonial Exhibition of ALBERT M A RX, and
the "ivorine" delights of WALTER. C.
COOKE. Especial commendation should be
given to the Canadian cards of MARY-
BOROUGH, GOULD & Co., and to the perfect
gallery of works of Art of every variety
contributed by 111 ы> ES i ш м кк & FAUXKNEB.
For artistic merit all the cards of the Season
are astonishing, it seems a pity that the tone
of their literary excellence could not be
raised. SPAHAONAPANE & Co. contribute to
Christmas cheerfulness by costly oosaqular
crackers, clever and dirimís; and DE LA
RUE checks frivolity by bringing oat his

and fancy. Make a present of one of the

remember those immortal designs of " Old

were lightly sketched in on that popular
gentleman's house-walls? The Academy
has taken a bold step, but it is right to
encourage Art. Let the Juvenile Etchers
beware of the Police.
Kelly's Directory for 1887 is excellent
reading for a spare half-hour. Some capital
numbers bound up together, and there's
scarcely a house mentioned without at least
one good storey to it. When is KELLY'S

be substituted for the one of Achilles in
Hyde Park, and called " A Kelly's statue."

STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH'S STUDIO.
No. IX.—THE Огнтоя Огнь.
THE Girton Girl, according to popular superstition, is a being of
doubtful age, few personal attractions, vague and startling opinions,
with habits and.garments to match. To her belong the cropped
head, the spectacles, th«
absence of collar, cuffs, and
figure, which are supposed
by the charitable to imply
compensating, though less
obvious, graces of mind.
Her environment, as she
would probably designate
her College rooms, is strictly
in keeping with her appear-
ance. The furniture is scanty
and uncomfortable, the^only
effort at decoration being a
natural science specimen, in
a glass jar, balanced by some
uncouth model, or the last
semi-scientific toy. She may
or may not be of a sociable
disposition, but her visitors
will find the tea weak, and
will see in her mired biscuit
tin a practical refutation of
the pnnoiple of "survival of
the fittest." She is a great
and ardent supporter of
numerous societies, mostly
of a metaphysical and specu-
lative character, and sne is
terribly in earnest with all
comers. A just sense of the dignity and superiority of her position
inspires her with a slightly aggressive contempt for all that is frivolous
and nninteUeotual. For her own thoughts run upon great and
stupendous social reforms which are to result in her admission to
St. Stephens, and in a complete recognition of the incontrovertible
fact that woman is, in all respects, equal to man, only more so.
This is the Girton girl, who scares the British matron as she
fiances timidly over her blinkers, the creature which will be recon-
structed by the Professor OWEN of the future from the fossilised
fragments of a cotton glove, and a heel-less shoe.
But she is fast becoming as extinct as her prototype, the Dodo.
The modern school-girl is taking her place, no longer the giggling,
flirting maiden of fiction, but an ascetic and hard-working young
woman. Work has been her lot since the day when she stepped out
of her cradle to combine education and amusement in the arrange-
ment of alphabet bricks; and she looks back with a wistful incre-
dulity to the time when the mystic letters, B. A., were to her nothing
worse than the voice of the hlack sheep in the nursery rhyme. She
inclines by instinct towards œsthetioism in dress, affecting the limpest
materials and the strangest hues, and making a compromise in the
matter of collar and cuffs hy wearing at neck and wrists a piece of
very ecru lace, turned down the wrong way. Her boots are the
terror of stray black-beetles, for a course of lectures on Hygienic
clothing early taught her to view with horror and distrust a slim
ancle, and a pointed toe. She has a scholarly touch of short-
sightedness, which she corrects by free use of the tortoiseshell
"pince-nez " that dangles from her neck.
Her sense of duty is remarkable, and appalling. She virtuously
accepts the onerous office of secretary to innumerable societies.
Countless notices, in her bold and clear handwriting, may be seen
day after day upon the College notice-boards, some of them of a
sufficiently pathetic character. "Will the following members be so
very good as to pay their subscriptions due the term before latí to
the ' Society for promoting Masculine Intelligence P '" She does not
even resent her appointment as sub-officer of the Fire Brigade, the
duties of which position involve a constant personal supervision of
two or three repulsively oily little hand-engines, which she tends
and lubricates with loving care, till she has reduced her hands and
face to the colour of the brown holland apron which enshrouds the
rest of her person. Not even the horrors of an alarm-practice can
daunt her, though she may just bave settled herself to revel for an
hour in the pleasant byeways of Professor SEDQWICK'S Ethics, when
screams of '' Fire 1" rushing footsteps, and an alarm-rattle, such as
heralds a bump in the May races, compel her to leave her books, and
fly to the Hall. Then the canvas buckets must be produced, her
corps arranged in alphabetical order, and marched off to the supposed
scene of action. All this she does in an incredibly short time; and
when, at the discretion of the head captain, the pumping of engines
and passing of buckets is allowed to stop, she returns to her work
with fortitude and resignation past belief.
t The Debating Society enjoys her hearty support, and her carefully
composed Addresses are smoothly delivered, in a slightly nervous
voice. Various as her subjects may be, they all meet with the same
exhaustive treatment. No half measures are admitted. The fonn-
dttions of her moral creed would totter if she could not find a meta-
physical basis for taking sugar in her tea. She may be seen opening
debates upon epoch-making subjects, such as, "Is the consumption of
green peas injurious to the evesight, and should vegetarianism, on
the whole, be encouraged?" For weeks previously the volume of the
Encyclopaedia containing "V" has been absent from the College
attributed to the plentiful pea-crop at Chios in 849 B.C., she wUl
glance lightly at the practice of РГТНАООВАЗ, and pass on to consider
the probability that mistletoe formed an important item in the diet of
the ancient Britons. Then, having traced the history of vegetarianism
up to the present reign, she warms to her subject as she progresses,
and after venturing far away from the carefully prepared track in a
burst of extempore eloquence, she finds herseU rather abruptly at
the end, and remarking, in a slightly constrained voice, "Therefore
I think the consumption of green peas if injurious to the eyesight,"
she resumes her seat and her customary reserve.
Her reputation gains her an attentive audience; but when the
opposer, who is a humble imitator, has spent twenty minutes upon
an inquiry into the spiritual condition of the Lotophagi, and its
bearing upon the subject under debate, the silence, which has so far
been 'exemplary, is gradually broken by the scraping and fidgeting
of chairs. Then comes a whisper or two, and, finally, a remark
from a much-bored and bolder member, to the effect that the lamps
smell detestably. This creates a slight disturbance, while an un-
offending lamp is removed; but the speaker proceeds inexorably
with her remarks. As soon as she has finished^ a merry-eyed girl
jumps up with the question, "Whether the Lotophagi (whoever
they may have been) were stupid enough to eat their salad without
eggs, and if not, whether they can properly be described as vegeta-
rians?" This is flippant, and both the opener of the debate and the
last speaker look their disapproval. But the obstructive seems im-
penitent, and the general feeling of the house now inclining towards
frivolity, the disoussion becomes a lively one, until, at ten o'clock,
the votes are taken, and all is over.
The members disperse, and our obstructive—who, among other
misdemeanors, has been sending round small notes of invitation
to tea during the debate—carries her friends off to her room. There
she disposes them upon a number of the lowest and easiest possible
chairs, and gives to each her own little tray, provided with tea-pot,
milk-jug, roll, and butter. From her provision-cupboard she pro-
duces jams, biscuits, and sardines, which, are supplemented, as she
has an enterprising mind, by oranges and a cocoa-nut, for second
course. Her rooms are pretty, and indicate that their owner is a
young woman of no severe type. The candle-light is softened by
pink shades; there are flowers in profusion, and knicknacks every-
where. Upon the desk is a strange jumble. Kanfi Pure Practical
Reason reposes stolidly upon a piece of fancy needlework, while
Calverley's Fly Leaves manages to preserve a jaunty air in spite of
the superincumbent weight of a volume of the Cambridge Review.
Her friends are chosen upon the same catholic principles, for she
is the most hospitable of hostesses, and indefatigable of tea-makers,
and her Sunday afternoon teas, with the additional attractions of
music and possible strangers, are deservedly popular. This eveniag
her soul has warmed towards the jaded opener and opposer of the
debate, who may be seen deep in the recesses of a cushioned corner
seat, helping each other to cake and jam in most friendly fashion.
By them is seated a tall, dark-haired girl, the athlete of the College,
winner of manylawn-tennis ties, and honoured in] many College songs,
while opposite her, crouched upon a footstool, and balancing her tea-
tray with extraordinary dexterity, is the pillar and pride of the
Amateur Dramatic Club. "Who '11 come to Madingley to-morrow?"
she is asking the company. "Examiners are poor creatures, and
I 'm not going to spoil them by working too hard." The suggestion
is universally approved, except by the debating talent in the corner,
where it is agreed that life is too short for such frivolities. "Non-
sense," she says. "I'll take your books, andfyoutoo, in a wheel-
barrow." But, inviting as the proposition may appear, it is unable
to overcome the objectors' sense of duty, till some one happily re-
members that a rare sort of beetle may be found in Madingley
woods. Entomology has formed part of the comprehensive educa-
tion of both the recusants, and at the thought ot the beetle their
scruples vanish. So they agree to make a party, and to finish the
day's proceedings by a fancy ball. "Masks and dominoes till ten,
and then each to unmask as soon as her name is guessed." Much
time is spent in settling and unsettling details, till at last the party
breaks up with many laughing '' good-nights," and the sound of foot-
steps recedes along the dark corridors, varied with an occasional clatter
as some one stumbles over the hot-water can and boots which stand
sentinel outside th« rooms of already slumbering fellow-students.

MEMOIRS OF A SECRET MISSION.
(Extracted from the Diary of Бгто, li.P.}
АКТА, Monday.—When "the
Government" who came aboard
at Elba lamented the fate which
brought personally home to him
the miseries i of NAPOLEON'S
exile, he spokel fondly of Civita
Vecchia. Had formerly been
"Government" there. "Ah,
Civita Vecchia!" he sighed.
Didn't say anything more, but
that enough to conjure up ideas
of earthly paradise. Rather
anxious to see Civita Vecchia,
still more anxious to leave it!
A curiously dirty place, cold
•withal, for now we have the
"Tramontana," a wind from
the North. But Civita Veochia
is only the stopping-place for
Home, and thither we went on
the morning after arrival.
Train forty minutes late; a
little incident that made all feel
homesick. "So like the South-
Western!" the Sailing-master
•aid. Spent some days in Hume, severely doing our duty. Saw St.
Peter's. Don't think the interior view a patch upon Cologne Cathedral.
Striking for vastness, of course; but prefer the stately simplicity of
Cologne. Too much mixing up of colours in variegated marble and
gilt. Just now things made much worse by hanging strips of scarlet
cloth at intervals over the walls. Regarded from the outside, would
rather look upon St. Paul's in the early morning from a point on the
Embankment somewhere about Waterloo Bridge. But then Some
cannot boast the marvellous mist that in some aspects lends beauty
to common objects in London.
The various departments of the Vatican let out in lots to seedy
gentlemen with sharp eyes. Each one is armed with authority
to demand half-a-franc from the visitor. One of these men in every
room, prowling about with stealthy footsteps, hovering ever by the
door of exit, lest, peradventure, absent-minded visitor escape with-
out leaving a wrack behind in the shape of half-a-f rano. It is the
same in all the public galleries in Italy, as far as I have seen them.
For example, at the Capitol there is an admission-fee of half-a-f rano
if you visit the Museum, and bang goes another fivepence if, regard-
less of expense, the visitor crosses over to the Palace of the Con-
servatori. At Naples there is a charge of a franc for admission to
the National Museum. This payment at the doors is better than the
prowling men in the rooms; but surely Italy is rich enough to throw
open its National Collections without these paltry charges. Suppose
we charged sixpence a-head to the British Museum, or had men
prowling for sixpences in every room in the National Gallery. How
the enemy would blaspheme! It is different at the excavations at
Pompeii (two francs) or at the Catacombs in Rome (two francs),
though it is a little odd to stumble into the resting-place of the
ancient dead through a turnstile of modern construction. Still, work
is going on in these places, and the gate-money goes to extend the
operations. It is otherwise in the National Picture Galleries.
A very leisurely people the Romans of to-day. Driving through
the older parts of the town leading to the Appian Way, came upon
narrow street where two carriages might pass each other but no room
for a third. The concatenation of rope and string that comprised the
harness of a two-horsed cart had broken down. The driver stopped
to mend it, thereby blocking up half the roadway, and stopping the
flow of traffic going westward. It was a much frequented thoroughfare
and a busy hour of the day. Gradually some twenty cabs, omnibuses
and carts, were blocked, but the youth in charge of the two-horsed
cart in nowise distressed; proceeded with provoking leisure to mend
the harness. More remarkable still the acquies-
cence of the intercepted throng. With a single
exception not a protest was made, everybody save
one quietly waiting till the knots were re-tied and
the cart moved on.
The exception was the Sailing-master; but hi§
temper had been ruffled by an incident which had
taken place just before we left the hotel. The
Sailing-master, sitting down to the breakfast-
table, threw back his Inverness cape. Officious
waiter eager to help the English Milord, coming
up behina caught hold of the sleeve of the Sailing-
master's frock-coat under the impression that it
belonged to the cape; violently tugged at it.
Sailing-master loudly protested; waiter thought
Milord with the irritability of the English was urging him to greate
exertions. Tugged at the coat-sleeve with maddened energy, an<
nearly pulled the frock-coat off before he was himself forcibly removed
Hence the Sailing-master growled threateningly, when we halted tei
minutes in a thoroughfare whilst a youth re-tied his horse's harness
Driving home later, met the Queen of ITALY taking the air in ai
open carriage with servants in the livery of England's cruel red. A
pleasant-faced lady; greeted me with a beaming smile and a gracicui
bow. Evidently recognised me, in spite of my attempts at disguise
Several old friends in Rome, Members of the Parliament disestab-
lished at the last Election. They are Liberals, but emphaticallj
not Gladstonians. Interesting to near the unanimity of their con-
demnation of his tactics at last Election. Only for him they would
all have been re-elected. Try to win them over to our side. Paint
in glowing colours the advantage of belonging to the Disunited
Unionists under опт Great Leader. No actual converts yet; but fancy
I 've sown some seed that will bear fruit.

"GOODWILL to Men! Goodwill to Men!"
What happier burden can they bear,
The Christmas bells which once again
King music through the frosty air?
Ring music! Let the cynic sneer,
The callous mock, the selfish fret,
The time of gladness and good cheer
Softens the human-hearted yet.
The Spirit of the Season rules
The saddest of our English Yules.
That Spirit at pur portals stands,
As pictured in our children's dreams,
Compassionate, with helpful hands,
And eyes in which affection gleams.
The kindly fancy who shall flout
As figment of a maudlin mood?
The groaning board, the gleeful rout
Are not the Season's chiefest good.
Hist! Hear you through the гетеГв roar
The piteous murmur of the poor?
It rises like an understrain
Through all the clamour of the year,
The moan of want, the groan of pain,
But in the crush who nalts to hear?
'Tie as the murmur of the tide,
Which seaboard-dwellers scarcely mark:
Yet liston! Up on every side
It surges sadly through the dark,
The immemorial anguished cry
Of suffering humanity I
Who bids us close our ears,"and'check
Untutored impulse swift to aid P
In that wide world of woe and wreck
Sin and unthrift their parts have played.
ЛЬ, yes 1 But who will dare assume
Divinely to discriminate P
A myriad blameless thralls of doom
There huddle helpless, desolate;
Women that faint, pale babes in bands.
And strong men wringing idle hands.
When law is more the rule of love.
Then love may act alone through law,
But Justice still abides above,
Below gapes Mammon's cruel jaw.
Back, BUMBLE! Systems lack defence
That fail to fit our human needs;
Mercy will not be driven hence;
The Spirit that for suffering pleads
Marks not the nicely more or less
In the deep current of Distress.
Exceptional P Alas! we know
That suffering is the bitter rule.
And shall that check Compassion's flow
Whilst merry bells ring in the Yule?
Yes, "Christmas cornes but onoe a year,"
And sorrow reigns the whole year round.
Let us, at least, spread mirth and cheer,
Whilst Christmas ohimings gladly sound.
Largess, good friends! Law leaves us still
That gentle Gospel of Goodwill!

THE BLOCK SYSTEM.
THE School Board has decided on not spoil-
ing the child by sparing the rod. Quite nght.
"The Board are desirous of keeping corporal
punishment within the narrowest limits pos-
sible." This sounds like administering the
rod to only the smallest boy. Any Etonian
Head Master—and to the Head Master alone
was given the power of swishing—would
have suggested that the punishment should
be placed on a broader basis. The block is
a good old-fashioned English punishment,
and whether as the Medieval Executioner's

its use in England may be summed up in
the cry, "Heads, or Taib?"

TURNING OVER NEW LEAVES.
(By Our Own Paper-Knifer. )
Days with Sir Roger de Coverky. (MACMILLAN.) "Oldfrien
De Cuverley Does look loverly," as Our Lazy Minstrel would sing i
he weren't so uncommonly lazy. It is capitally got up, and moe
of the illustrations—by a hand unknown to us and name not men
tioned—are remarkably spirited and good. The only exception is th
frontispiece, which contains a most striking example of a Reyersibl
Woman, or carelessly-joined lidy, who seems to be advancing an<
receding at the same time while engaged in the mazy danoe. I
might have been called in allusion to the dance and the lady "Л
Complicated Figure."
Now if you want some volumes nice,
You '11 start at once I 'm su-er,
And go and fetch them in a trice,
From Messrs. FIELD AND TUES. The Literary Cure
""Quite so! The Leaden,
hall Press turns out a lot о
light literature, which ii
surprising, seeing you havi
to take lead and all. Bu
asSHAKSPEARE saye, " Taki
it for Leadenhall, we ne'er
shall look upon its lib
again." Here we have л
2'housand Quaint Cuts
from books of other days
"The books of other days
have faded," but their cuts
are as incisive as ever
Also Sir Charles Grandison, and Solomon Gissner, both illustratec
with the original copper-plates—the latter after STOTHAJLD'S draw-
ings. Drat the Boys, is the most delightful and humorous recollec-
tions of a French Master in England by MAX O'RELL. "Oh! relly
MAX, 'tis most diverting," say the boys,—and they ought to know.
Haste thee, Nymph, undo the "passell,
Of the books that come from CASSELL!
Rhymes before Reason. [ Heady with the next Fog.
Yes, yes! Bustle ye, my Nymph—and be in the fashion! Improve.
Character Sketches from Thackeray, capitally reproduced in photo-
gravure from FBEDEBICK BARNARD'S most excellent drawings.
These are all worth framing, if you happen to be in that frame oi
mind. They will be popular among all lovers of THACKEKAT. JVt
Desperandum by the Rev. FBEBEBICK LANQBRIDQE. Boys need
never despair when this lang bridge carries them safely over the
stream of idleness. "It is a lang bridge that has no turning." And
this lang bridge seems to have a turn for amusing young folks.
But if you would improve your mind,
And not omit some fun,
You all of you are bound to go
To JOHN HOGQ or none! Haroun AlrasJier'd.
Why, cert'nly. Here's the Vicar of Wakefield—th&t delightful
bit of GOLDSMITH'S art of which we are never weary. Then the in-
defatigable DAVENPORT ADAMS gives us Master Minds in Art
Science, and Letters. What's the sequel? Pupil minds, &c., or
is punished. Л Fein Good Women, and what they Teach Us,
is a good girls' .book, for good or naughty girls. Alas ! savs Our
Special Cynic, that there are so few good women: and, according to
Том M mu; i:, whose only books were women's looks, folly is all they
teacb us. A careful perusal of Miss MARY MAC SORLEY s book wiU
show Our Special Cynic that he is altogether mistaken.
Yes, we will! We will refresh our memories by the aid of the
books published by CHARLES & Co. We will re-read all that Mrs.
ELLIS nas said about The Women of England, The Daughters of
England, The Wives of England, and The Mothers of England, and
then we will go and get married, or not, as the case may be.
Ño children want to go abroad
Who get their books from MARCUS WARD.
Ward and. Reward, a Tinlacular Romanee. [Ready and
Certainly not! No child will ever want to go abroad if it can be
At Home Again with the pretty pictures by J. G. SOWEBBY and
THOMAS CRANE, and the pleasant verses of Miss ELIZA KEARY.
Miss KBABY has likewise sung a pleasant accompaniment to Mies
EDITH SCANNELL'S clever pictures in Pets and Playmates. Pick
where you like they 're good throughout. A Romance of The Three
Jt.'i. A rare, right-rollickful, refreshing, radiant romance, in which
:he rousch road of students of The Three R.'s is rendered rosy by
;he clever fancy and the skilful pencil of WALTER CBANE. And
:hen there 's one more'R, which stands for ROUTLEDGE, whose Christ-
mas publications are so far beyond all praise, that we can't find
words to exprès» our delight, and во we stop short, that is as short a«
possible.
IN THE COURT OF COMMON SENSE.
London Theatres v. Parisian Theatres.—Mr. Justice PUNCH said,
that this was a case strictly within the jurisdiction of this Court,
whose mandates, though they often are a considerable time in taking
effect, must be ultimately obeyed. There was no doubt in his mind
that, with the exception of the Eden Theatre, there was not a com-
fortable Theatre in Paris, at least not in the sense in which we
consider our principal Theatres comfortable, though as a matter of
fact, he might say that while the term comfortable could be applied
to most Theatres in London, the principal ones were, he should
distinctly say, with reference to their stall and circle accommodation,
positively luxurious.
Surely in the dead season of next year the Parisian Theatres might
be gutted, cleaned, refurnished, refitted, and properly ventilated,
and when this had been done the entr'actes need only be ten minutes
instead of about half an hour, and everybody would gain by the
improvement.

?o be worried thus for nothing, to be badgered at the price.
"WHO KEEPS DIARIES ? "—The other day the public was informed,
n excellent feminine authority, that a diary like a "little know-
edge" is "a dangerous thing." This does not apply to the two
elebrated firms Messrs. LETTS and Messrs. J. J. & J. SMITH, who keep
iaries regularly, bat get rid of them as fast as possible,—not because
hey're dangerous, bat because they are so uncommonly useful.
4o. 21, in the Messrs. SMITH'S list is " The Daily Block Calendar,"
xcellent as memoranda for School-masters and obstructionists.
No. 23, is "The Family i Washing Book—covered cloth,"—the last

THE WARRIORS OF THE SEA. A LIFE-BOAT STORY.

1
UP goes the Lytham signal! St. Anne's has gammoned hands!
Knee-deep in surf the Life-Boat's launched abreast of Southpsrt
sands!
Hilf deafened by the screaming wind: half hlinded by the rain,
Three crews await their Coxswains, and face the hurricane!
The stakes are death or duty 1 Ko man has answered "No!"
Lives must he saved out yonder on the doomed ship Mexico!
Did ever night look blacker? did sea so hiss before?
Did ever women's voices wail more piteous on the shore?
Out from three ports of Lancashire that night went Life-boats three,
To fight a splendid battle, manned by Warriors of the Sea!
Along the sands of Southport, brave women held their breath,
For they knew that those who loved them, were fighting hard with
A cheer went out from Lytham! the tempest t >st it back, [death,
As the gallant lads of Lancashire bent to the waves' attack;
And girls who dwell about St. Anne's, with faces white with fright,
Pray'd God would still the tempest, that dark December night.
Sons, husbands, lovers, brothers, they 'd given up their all,
These noble English women heart-sick at duty's call;
But not a cheer, or tear, or prayer, from those who bent the knee,
Came out across the waves to nerve those Warriors of the Sea!
Three boats went out from Lancashire, bat one came back to tell,
The story of that hurricane, the tale of ocean's hell!
All safely reached the Mexico, their trysting-place to'keep,
For one there was the rescue, the others ¡a the deep
Fell in the arms of victory! dropped to their lonely grave,
Their passing bell the tempest, their requiem the wave!
They clung to life like sailors, they fell to death like men,
Where, in pur roll of heroes Ï When in our story? When?
Hive Englishmen been braver, or fought more loyally,
With death that comes by duty to the Warriors of the Sea 1
One boat came back to Lytham! its noble duty done,
But at St. Anne's and Southport, the prize of Death was won!
Won by those gallant fellows, who went men's lives to save,
And died there crown'd with glory! enthroned upon the wave!
Within a rope's throw of the wreck, the English sailors fell.
A blessing on their faithful lips, when ocean rang their knell;
Weep not for them, dear women! cease wringing of your hands!
(!ii out to meet your heroes across the Soutbport sand«!
(Iriin Death for them is stingless! The Grave has victory!
Cross oars and bear them nobly home! Brave Warriors of the Sea!
When in dark nights of winter, fierce storms of wind and rain,
Howl round the cosy homestead, and lash the window-pane,
When over hill and tree-top, we hear the tempests roar,
And hurricanes go sweeping on, from valley to the shore,
When nature seems to stand at bay, and silent terror comes,
And those we love on earth the best are gathered in our homes!
Think of the sailors round the coast, who braving sleet or snow.
Leave sweethearts, wives, and little ones, when duty bids them^go!
Think of our sea-girt island! a harbour, where alone,
No Englishman to save a life has failed to risk his own!
Then when the storm howls loudest, pray of your charity,
That God will bless the Life-Boat! and the Warriors of the Sea 1
AN ADELPHI GUEST AT WESTMINSTER.
Mr DEAR MR. PUNCH,
As a first-class Classic I couldn't miss the Westminster Play.
There was very little in Dean's Yard to show that the Queen's
Scholars of St. Peter's were holding their annual dramatic revel.
A solitary policeman pointed to a linkman standing in front of a
door belonging to the South face of the Square, and told inquirers that
"they had to go there, if they wanted to see the acting."
Certainly the night was stormy, a fact that made the want
of a proper protection from the weather across the paved court leading
to College the more apparent. Delicate ladies in evening dress had
to walk in the pelting rain to the dormitory in which the play was
performed, running the risk of catching their deaths of cold in the
journey. Once inside the building, however, they were well looked
after. Polite young Queen's .Scholar», in irreproachable evening
dress and caps and gowns, were in waiting to escort them to their
places, after presenting them with programmes containing not only
the Dramatis Persona, but also "the plot of the Adelphi." Later
on these honoured guests (who were seated in a side-gaUery apart
from the masculine members of the audience) were regaled with ices
and wafers. The pink and white tickets had given "hor. 7," as the
hour for the commencement of the performances, but it was quite
five-and-twenty minutes to eight before we heard the strains of See
the Conquering Hero Comes," the very appropriate processional
march hypothecated by ancient custom to the Head Master of West-
minster and his party. The small boys at the back of the gallery
(conducted by a cane-carrying Senior) clapped violently, much to
he delight of the Dean who stood bowing and smiling with his back
turned to the proscenium and taking ''the reception," entirely to
himself.
Then came the Captain of the Queen's Scholars, wearing knee-
breeches and black-silk stockings, before the curtain, to speak the
Prologue. He had not much to say. Once or twice he faltered,
when the sweet voice of the prompter was heard to complain, and
now and again, when he made a longer pause than usual, the lads in
the gallery thundered down their applause. After the Captain had
disappeared, conversation was resumed in the auditorium, and the
audience had time to look around them, to greet old acquaintances, or
to nod to new friends. The ladies took particular interest in the
names painted on the walls. Here were generations of old West-
minsters recorded in inks, in shades varying with the dates of the
inscriptions.
After a pause the green curtains parted, to show the beautiful
scene painted by a Royal Academician for Old Westminsters many,
many years ago. There was a burst of applause, repeated four or
five times during the evening whenever the picture was disclosed.
This e¿a<7««-management of the Senior in charge was a mistake, as it
took from the cheering all semblance to spontaniety. The appear-
ance of Mido (an aged gentleman, apparently, to judge from hie
statue of tender years) was a signal for renewed plaudits. It would
be tedious to record the points of the performance in detail. It was
tedious enough to see—of course I mean for those who did not under-
stand it, not to an intelligent scholar like yours, truly, who keeps up
his " Verbum personale concordat," as the old Romans had it.
Perhaps, after all, the claque was useful, or some of us might either
have gone to sleep, or have laughed in the wrong places.
Act after Act passed away, and then, after a longer pause, came the
Epilogue. It was rather a serious joke. At the finish there was
aery of "Plaudite.'" from the actors and a demand for "Cap!"
from the audience. The "mortar-board," according to ancient
custom, was passed round among the Old Westminster« and their
friends, who contributed the regulation sovereign with their usual
good will,—but at this point I took my departure, greatly pleased
with my evening's entertainment. Yourg economically,
А PERAMBULATING PLEASURE-SEEKER.
